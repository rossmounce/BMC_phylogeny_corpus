Abstract
Background: Hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) possesses a large genome that contains 1.6
× 1010 bp of DNA. Isolation of a large number of gene sequences from complex gene families with
a high level of gene sequence identity from genomic DNA is therefore difficult and time-consuming.
Bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries can be useful for such work. Here we report on an
efficient approach for rapid isolation and sequencing of the low molecular weight glutenin subunit
gene family from the 'Glenlea' wheat BAC library via primer-template mismatch PCR using universal
primers, primer walking using hemi-nested touchdown (TD) PCR, and followed by direct
sequencing of PCR products.
Results: For the primer-template mismatch PCR, the universal primers were designed based on
conserved gene coding regions of consensus sequences. The effects of the universal primertemplate mismatches on the efficiency of standard PCR amplification were investigated after
assembly of sequences from different primers amplifying the same BAC clones. Single or multiple
mismatches were observed at 5' terminal, internal and the penultimate position, respectively. These
mismatches included the transition mispairs G:T, T:G, A:C and the transversion mispairs A:A, A:G,
G:G, G:A. Two or more primer-template mismatches reduced PCR product yield approximately
from 2-fold to 10-fold compared to PCR product yield without the primer-template mismatch. For
the hemi-nested TD PCR, primers were designed based on the known sequences obtained and/or
published. The hemi-nested TD PCR increased both specificity and yield by high and low annealing
temperatures in two consecutive amplifications. Comparison of two methods for purifying PCR
products prior to sequencing showed that purification using MultiScreen384-PCR filter plates had
an advantage over ethanol purification because greater numbers of sequencing reactions could be
performed from comparable volumes of PCR reactions.
Conclusion: This approach was fast, easy and cost-effective for isolation and sequencing of genes
from complex gene families. It may be suitable for (i) isolation of other complex gene families and/
or gene homologues from BAC libraries, (ii) for characterization of multi-copy repetitive elements
pending availability of BAC libraries, and (iii) for filling in gaps in shotgun BAC sequencing.

Background
Bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries are useful
for genome analysis, comparative genomics, physical
mapping and map-based cloning [1-4]. They can also be
used to isolate genes from complex gene families. If a BAC
clone contains a single gene, complete gene sequence may
be isolated through gene-specific PCR amplification and
subsequent primer walking [5] using BAC DNA as template and specific primers close to the end the known
sequence obtained. If a BAC clone contains two or more
genes that display a high level of gene sequence identity
such as the low molecular weight glutenin subunit (LMWGS) genes, the primer walking using BAC DNA as template is likely not going to succeed due to multiple binding sites of the sequencing primer. PCR amplification is a
favorite strategy for isolation of unknown genomic
sequences adjacent to known sequences. Several PCR
methods are available for this purpose such as inverse
PCR [6], ligation-mediated PCR [7], T-linker PCR [8] and
TAIL PCR [9]. These methods either require digestion and
ligation procedures or are cumbersome, laborious and
technically demanding. In addition, they can not ensure
specific amplification of individual genes from BAC
clones containing two or more genes. Nested PCR [10] is
useful in achieving the specificity by the amplification of
an extended nucleotide sequence followed by the amplification of a region located within the first amplicon.
Touchdown (TD) PCR [11] is a versatile one-step procedure for optimizing PCRs to obtain the specificity even if
the degree of primer-template complementarity is not
fully known [12]. Here we describe a novel PCR method
that combined hemi-nested PCR (a single internal
primer) with touchdown PCR for primer-template mismatches. This method is very useful for rapid isolation
and sequencing of gene families from BAC libraries.
Wheat gluten is composed of two major groups of proteins, monomeric gliadins and polymeric glutenins.
Wheat glutenins consist of high molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GSs) and LMW-GSs. Together, they
are the major determinants of wheat bread-making quality. HMW glutenins have been extensively studied because
of their importance in dough rheology and their relative
ease of analysis at the protein and DNA levels. HMW glutenins represent a small family with a maximum of five of
the six subunits expressed, while LMW glutenin genes are
part of a much more complex gene family [13].
LMW glutenins represent approximately 40% of the total
wheat gluten fraction. LMW-GSs have molecular weight
values ranging from 30 KDa to 50 KDa and are about 5–6
times more abundant than HMW-GSs [13] and are therefore the main components of the glutenin polymers.
LMW-GSs are encoded at the Glu-A3, Glu-B3 and Glu-D3
loci on the short arms of chromosomes 1A, 1B and 1D,
respectively. The number of LMW glutenin-like genes in
hexaploid wheat was estimated to range from 30 to 40

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/8/18

based on Southern hybridization [14]. These LMW-GS
genes were classified into three types, LMW-i, LMW-m and
LMW-s, based on the first amino acid residue of their Nterminal sequences, which correspond to isoleucine,
methionine and serine, respectively [13]. However, LMW
glutenins have been less studied because of their abundance and the inherent difficulty to characterize them at
the protein level i.e. SDS-PAGE. The loci are complex with
many subunits encoded at each locus and the presence of
pseudogenes.
'Glenlea' is a Canadian Western Extra Strong (CWES)
spring wheat variety. The LMW-i and LMW-s type genes in
'Glenlea' have been recently cloned using genomic DNA
and developing seed cDNA libraries [15,16]. To date,
more than 90 cDNA and genomic DNA clones of LMWGS genes have been published [17]. Most studies reported
only a single or very few genomic DNA clones of LMW-GS
genes that were isolated from a given wheat variety due to
their complex compositions [15,16]. To further our
understanding of the LMW-GS gene family, a BAC library
was constructed from 'Glenlea' [18]. Here we report an
efficient method for rapid isolation of sequences of the
complex LMW-GS gene family from the 'Glenlea' BAC
library using universal primers for primer-template mismatch PCR, primer walking using hemi-nested touchdown PCR and direct sequencing of PCR products.

Results
Identification of BAC clones containing LMW-GS genes
A total of 383 positive BAC clones were identified by
screening the 24 high-density filters with the LMW-GS
composite probe. Positive signals may include BAC clones
containing gliadin sequences, because LMW-GS and gliadin sequences share approximately 60% similarities [13].

In order to confirm the identity of positive BAC clones
containing LMW-GS genes, LMW-GS specific primers
were designed. After PCR screening, 72 out of the 383 BAC
clones produced one amplicon with at least one of the
three primer pairs. Thirty-one BAC clones were identified
by single primer pair, while 41 BAC clones were identified
by using two or three primer pairs (Table 1). Fig. 1 shows
eight representative BAC clones identified using the
primer pair LMWF3/LMWR4.
Clean-up and direct sequencing of PCR products
In order to remove the remaining salts, unincorporated
dNTPs and primers from the PCR reactions, we compared
two PCR purification methods, i.e. MultiScreen384-PCR
filter plate and ethanol precipitation, for their ability to
produce large amounts of high quality template for
sequencing reactions. The PCR product from a single PCR
reaction purified using the ethanol precipitation was only
sufficient for a single sequencing reaction, whereas the
combined PCR product from two PCR reactions purified
using the MultiScreen384-PCR filter plate was sufficient for

five (PCR with primer-template mismatches, see below)
to 16 (PCR without primer-template mismatch) sequencing reactions. Hence, the Multiscreen384-PCR filter plate
provided better recovery of PCR products and was particularly efficient for weak amplifications with primer-template mismatches. Both PCR purification methods
produced 100% successful sequencing reactions. The
length of high quality sequences obtained using ethanol
precipitation and MultiScreen384-PCR filter plate was 530
and 548 bases, respectively.
Given the large number of PCR products to be sequenced,
we employed a direct sequencing approach using the
same primers used for the PCR reactions. Direct sequencing of PCR amplicons is efficient and cost-effective. Therefore, direct sequencing is advantageous over the cloning
approach which is time-consuming and costly.

sequence length with Phred score greater than 20 could
reach up to 630 bases with an average of 535 bases. A single LMW-GS sequence was isolated in 23 BAC clones
using one of the three individual primers, whereas 29 BAC
clones had two or three single sequences isolated by different primers. This indicated that the 29 BAC clones
might contain a single or two LMW-GS gene(s), when different sequences were assembled into one or two contigs.
The remaining 20 BAC clones had a LMW-GS pseudogene
sequence or two LMW-GS sequences isolated by a single
primer pair, which resulted in overlapping sequences. For
these BAC clones with the overlapping sequences using
one pair of primers, specific primers need to be designed
to amplify individual LMW-GS genes.
Nucleotide sequence alignment
Twenty-three high quality sequences of partial LMW-GS
genes were isolated using the primer set LMWF11/
LMWR11. Their length ranges from 556 to 711 bases with
an average of 628 bases. A phylogenetic tree of the 23
sequences was constructed using MEGA3.1. The 23
sequences were clustered into six groups, which correspond to six different N-terminal sequences of LMW-m
and LMW-s type genes (Fig. 2). Sequence alignment
showed that the sequences from different BAC clones in
the same groups were identical in the aligned regions, suggesting that these BAC clones may contain identical LMWGS genes.

Hemi-nested TD PCR for primer walking
After we obtained partial sequences of the coding regions
of LMW-GS genes from individual BAC clones using the
universal primers, we first tried to perform primer walking
using BAC DNA as template and specific primers close to
the end the known sequence obtained. This method
worked well for BAC clones containing single LMW-GS
gene in many cases, but not for BAC clones containing
two or more LMW-GS genes (data not shown). Then we
tried to use TAIL PCR for the BAC clones containing two
or more LMW-GS genes by designing three specific primers based on the known sequences obtained and one
degenerated primer as described in Liu and Huang [9]. In
many cases, either more than two PCR products were
amplified or no amplicons were generated (data not
shown). Thirdly, we designed primers based on 5' and 3'
terminal sequences of the known LMW-GS gene sequence
[GenBank: X13306] [19] combined with the above mentioned specific primers in order to generate PCR fragments
from these BAC clones by primer-template mismatches.
This method did not work for all BAC clones even though
we optimized PCR conditions by decreasing the concentration of Mg+2 or/and using different annealing temperatures. After numerous attempts, we finally developed a
novel PCR method, hemi-nested TD PCR combined with
primer-template mismatches, for primer walking. As
shown in Fig. 3A, standard PCR of seven BAC clones using
the forward primer LMWF38d and the external reverse
primer LMWR19b with annealing temperature at 50°C
generated multiple unspecific amplicons. Standard PCR
using the same primers with annealing temperature at
60°C did not produce amplification at all (data not
shown). Fig. 3B shows the first round TD PCR amplification using a program in which the annealing temperature
is progressively lowered from 65°C to 50°C by 0.5°C
every cycle, followed by 15 additional cycles at 50°C.
Faint single PCR product was observed for five BAC clones
and two PCR amplicons were generated for BAC clone
TaE0212J01. After the second round hemi-nested TD PCR
using the same forward primer LMWF38d and the internal
reverse primer LMWR19c with the same TD program, a
single strong PCR product was amplified for the all seven
BAC clones (Fig. 3C). When the amplicons of Figure 3A
were amplified using the same primers and PCR conditions, the identical PCR products were observed but they
were weaker than the amplicons in Figure 3C (data not
shown). The hemi-nested TD PCR worked well for all the
BAC clones irrespective of the presence of one or two
LMW-GS genes. So far, two different LMW-GS gene
sequences have been obtained from four BAC clones,
respectively.

Discussion
We regularly use BAC pool screening to identify BAC
clones from our library. This method is quite efficient for

single or low copy target. Our library contains more than
650000 clones and can be screened by this method using
only 221 PCR reactions. Filter hybridization is however
much more efficient for large gene family such as the
LMW-GS gene family described in this study. Considering
that nearly 400 BAC clones were identified, would translate in the identification of more than 300 Super Plate
Pools (SPP). The screening of the Plate Pools, Row Pools
and Column Pools for such a large number of SPP would
be far more labour intensive than filter hybridization in
this case. Since LMW-GS genes have about 60% sequence
similarities with gliadin genes [13], we identified positive
BAC clones containing LMW-GS genes using hybridiza-

tion screening followed by PCR validation. Of the 383
BAC clones identified by the filter hybridization, 72 were
confirmed to have LMW-GS gene(s) using three LMW-GS
gene-specific primers (Table 1).
Direct sequencing of PCR products amplified by mismatch
primers
PCR amplifications of most BAC clones were generated by
mismatch primers (see below). Direct sequencing of these
PCR amplicons is also advantageous over the cloning
approach, because the mismatch primers do not exist in
the sequences obtained using direct sequencing, but in the
sequences obtained using M13 forward and reverse primers for plasmid DNA from the cloning method. In this
case, the sequences from the cloned PCR products using
the mismatch primers will affect the sequence assembly
from different PCR products unless the mismatch primers
are removed before sequence assembly. If primers amplify
multiple fragments with different sequences from one
BAC clone, direct sequencing is not useful. Cloning the
multiple fragments into separate colonies makes it possible to sequence them separately.
Primer-template mismatches
PCR amplification requires two primers complementary
to the beginning and the end of the DNA fragment of the
template in opposite orientation. When genomic DNA is
used for PCR amplification, the primers first bind the template with complementarity (perfect match). If complementary template is not present, the primers may bind the
template with non-complementarity (mismatch). By utilizing this strategy, homologous sequences from different
varieties or homoeologous sequences from different
related species may be successfully amplified and cloned.
BAC DNAs with their 100–150 kb sequences have
reduced complexity when compared to genomic DNAs
and a perfect match to given primers may not be present.
LMW-GS genes share approximately 80% identity [13]. As
a consequence, universal primer pairs can be designed
based on conserved regions of consensus sequences and
used to amplify a number of LMW-GS genes using different BAC DNA as templates.

The present study confirmed this hypothesis. Using BAC
DNA as template and primer-template mismatches, the
primer set LMWF11/LMWR11 designed from LMW-s type
gene (AY542898) [20] could amplify LMW-m type genes
(Fig. 2). Similarly, the primer set LMWF3/LMWR4
designed from LMW-m type genes [20] could amplify
LMW-s type genes (see below). The primer set LMWF10/
LMWR9 designed from LMW-i type genes [15,20] could
amplify all three gene types, LMW-i, LMW-m and LMW-s
(data not shown).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/8/18

Several studies have investigated the effects of primer-template mismatches at the 3' terminus of one primer on the
efficiency of PCR amplification [21-25]. Assembly of
sequences from different primers amplifying the same
BAC clones allows us to make detailed analysis of the
primer-template mismatches between the primers
LMWF3/LMWR4 and eight different BAC clones (Table 2).
Eight different LMW-GS genes, corresponding to LMW-m
and LMW-s types, were isolated using the primer set
LMWF3/LMWR4. Single or multiple mismatches were
observed at 5' terminal, internal and the penultimate
position, respectively. These mismatches included the
transition mispairs G:T, T:G, A:C and the transversion
mispairs A:A, A:G, G:G, G:A. The investigation of Kwok et
al. [22] indicated that single internal mismatches had no
significant effect on PCR product yield, while those at the
3'-terminal base significantly reduced PCR product yield.
In the present study, the reduction of PCR product yield
correlated with the number of the primer-template mismatches. The primer LMWF3 has two internal mismatches
with the BAC clone TaE0099E23 as template, whereas the
primers LMWF3 and LMWR4 have one penultimate mismatch from the 3'-terminus and one internal mismatch,
respectively, with the template of the BAC clone
TaE1238L16 (Table 2). Two primer-template mismatches
reduced PCR product yield approximately 2-fold, three or
more primer-template mismatches reduced PCR product
yield about up to 10-fold, as compared to PCR product
yield of TaE0503E07 without the primer-template mismatch (Table 2 and Fig. 1). A different signal intensity
occurred in the BAC clones TaE1157C20 (sample 5) and
TaE0703A09 (sample 6) in Figure 1, even though these
two clones have the same mismatsches (Table 2). A possible explanation is the insertion size of TaE1157C20 being
larger than that of TaE0703A09, which resulted in the
amount of initial target template of TaE1157C20 being
relatively smaller than that of TaE0703A09 with the same
amount (ng) of BAC DNA. A primer-template mismatch
at the 3'-terminus was not found in this study. The effect
of the primer-template mismatch at the 3'-terminus of
one or both primers on PCR amplified for LMW-GS genes
could be investigated by deliberately introducing base
alteration at the 3'-terminus of synthesized primers.
Hemi-nested TD PCR for primer walking
Both nested PCR and TD PCR can produce specific fragments [10,11]. Nested PCR was widely used to detected
specific viral DNA sequences in clinical specimens [26].
TD PCR has been used to eliminate multiple unwanted
products in which the degree of primer-template complementary is not fully known [12]. High and low annealing
temperatures in TD PCR could increase both specificity
and yield [12]. In the present study, we developed a novel
PCR technique for primer walking, hemi-nested TD PCR,
which combines nested PCR with TD PCR for primer-tem-

plate amplification. Compared with other PCR method
for primer walking, the hemi-nested TD PCR has many
advantages: (i) a simple protocol without any digestion
and ligation steps; (ii) high specificity; and (iii) high yield
of PCR products, which can be directly sequenced.
Design of universal primers based on primer-template
mismatches for the identification of all positive BAC
clones containing LMW-GS genes is a useful approach
towards isolation of all LMW-GS gene sequences from a
wheat BAC library. Complete LMW-GS gene sequences
will be obtained by primer walking using the hemi-nested
touchdown PCR and direct sequencing of amplified PCR
products using the same primers. So far, 12 complete
LMW-GS gene sequences including their untranslated 5'
and 3' flanking regions from different BAC clones have
been obtained using the above described procedures (data
not shown). This work is in progress and all LMW-GS gene
sequences will be isolated from the 'Glenlea' BAC library
in the near future.

Conclusion
In summary, this paper describes a detailed and efficient
method for rapid isolation of LMW-GS gene sequences
from the wheat 'Glenlea' BAC library using filter hybridization followed by primer-template mismatch PCR combined with hemi-nested touchdown PCR and direct
sequencing of PCR products. This approach was fast, easy
and cost-effective. It may be suitable for (i) isolation of
other complex gene families and/or gene homologues
from BAC libraries, (ii) for characterization of multi-copy
repetitive elements pending availability of BAC libraries,
and (iii) for filling in gaps in shotgun BAC sequencing.

Methods
BAC library screening
The Glenlea BAC library contains 656 640 clones with
3.1× haploid genome coverage and has been gridded onto
24 high-density filters [18]. A composite probe, consisting
of the complete coding regions of a LMW-i [Gen-

Bank:AY542896] [15], a LMW-m [GenBank: AY542897]
and a LMW-s [GenBank:AY542898] [20], was labeled
with [α-32P]dCTP using Ready-to-Go DNA labeling beads
(Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) and used to
screen the 24 high-density filters. Hybridization was performed as described in Nilmalgoda et al [18].
BAC DNA extraction
Positive BAC clones identified by high-density filter
hybridization were inoculated in 96-well plates containing 1.5 mL of 2× YT supplemented with 12.5 µg chloramphenicol/ml and were grown in a C25KC incubator
shaker (New Brunswick Scientific Co., Edison, NJ, USA) at
37°C and 300 rpm for 20 h. BAC DNA was isolated and
purified using an Eppendorf Perfectprep BAC 96 purification kit (Hamburg, Germany) adapted for a liquid handling robot (Qiagen 3000, Mississauga, ON, Canada).
BAC DNA was eluted in a final volume of 60 µl.
LMW-GS gene-specific primer design and PCR
LMW-GS gene-specific primers were designed using
Primer3 [27]. The primer pairs LMWF3/LMWR4 and
LMWF10/LMWR9 were designed based on the coding
regions of consensus sequences of full-length LMW-m and
-i type cDNA clones, whereas the forward primer LMWF11
and the reverse primer LMWR11 were from the promoter
region and the repetitive domain of genomic sequence of
LMW-s type AY542898 (Table 3) [16]. These primers were
used to amplify LMW-GS genes using the BAC clones
identified by hybridization and 'Glenlea' genomic DNA as
templates.

The PCR reactions used either 5–10 ng BAC DNA or 200
ng genomic DNA as template, 1× PCR buffer, 1 mM
MgCl2 (to increase the stringency of the reactions), 0.8
mM dNTPs, 0.6 µM of each primer, 0.1 µl of 10× BSA (1
mg/ml) and 1 Unit Taq DNA polymerase made up to a
final volume of 25 µl with sterile ddH2O. The PCR reaction was carried out in a PTC-100 thermocycler (MJ
Research Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). Following 5 min of

denaturation at 94°C, 35 cycles were performed with 30 s
at 94°C, 30 s at 60°C, 90 s at 72°C, and a final extension
step of 10 min at 72°C. PCR products were separated on
a 1.5% agarose gel in 0.5× TBE buffer. The gel was photographed and PCR band intensity was measured using the
spot densitometry analysis tool of an AlphaImager HP
imaging system (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA,
USA). The amplicons were quantified by comparing their
pixel intensity values designated density value to reference
samples which in this case were lambda HindIII fragments
of known concentrations.
Primer walking by hemi-nested touchdown (TD) PCR
For primer walking, the forward primer LMWF38d (5'TATCACTCCACCTCAGCATTG-3') was designed from the
promoter region of a previously cloned LMW glutenin
gene [LMWG-1D1; GenBank: X13306] [19]. The external
(LMWR19b: 5'-TGTTGTTGTGGAGGTAAAACTA-3') and
internal (LMWR19c: 5'-GAAAATGGTGGTTGTTGCTG-3')
reverse primers were designed based on the sequences
obtained from the PCR product of BAC clone
TaE0879B18 amplified using the primer pair LMWF3/
LMWR4. The standard PCR reaction was the same as the
above, except that 1.5 mM instead of 1 mM MgCl2 and
annealing temperature at 50°C were used. The forward
primer LMWF38d and the external reverse primer
LMWR19b were used for the first round TD PCR. The PCR
reaction was the same as the above mentioned standard
PCR. Following 5 min of denaturation at 94°C, samples
were subjected to 30 cycles in a TD program (94°C for 30
s, 65°C for 30 s and 72°C for 90 s, followed by a 0.5°C
decrease of the annealing temperature every cycle). After
completion of the TD program, 15 cycles were subsequently performed (94°C for 30 s, 50°C for 30 s and
72°C s for 90 s) ending with a 10 min extension at 72°C.
One microliter of the first round TD PCR product was
diluted with 199 µl distilled water and 1 µl of the diluted
DNA was added to the second round hemi-nested TD PCR
mixture. The same forward primer LMWF38d and the
internal reverse primer LMWR19c as well as the same TD
program were used for the hemi-nested TD PCR amplification.

Purification of PCR products
Purification of PCR products using MultiScreen384-PCR filter plates
Purification of PCR products was performed using
MultiScreen384-PCR filter plates following manufacturer's
introduction with some modifications (Millipore Corp.,
Billerica, MA, USA). A total of 50 µl from two 25 µl PCR
reactions were transferred to a single well of a
MultiScreen384-PCR filter plate. The MultiScreen384-PCR
filter plate was placed on a MultiScreen vacuum manifold
(Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA, USA) and the vacuum was
applied for 20 min at 10 inches of Hg, or until the wells
were completely empty. The plate was removed from the
vacuum manifold and any remaining droplets were blotted from the bottom of the filter with a paper towel. MilliQ-grade water (65 µl) was added to each well and the
above steps were repeated. Then Milli-Q-grade water (52
µl) was added to each well and the samples were resuspended on a plate shaker at low speed for 10 min. After
mixing by pipetting up and down, the purified product
was transferred from MultiScreen384-PCR filter plate to
96-well PCR plate for storage. The concentration of the
purified product was estimated on 1.5% agarose gel in
0.5× TBE buffer using a 2 µl aliquot of sample added to 10
µl of water and 2 µl of 6× loading buffer.
Purification of PCR products by ethanol precipitation
Alternatively, PCR products can be purified using ethanol
precipitation. Each well (25 µl reaction) of the 96-well
PCR plate had 4.2 µl of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and
60 µl of pre-chilled 95% ethanol (-20°C) added. The plate
was placed in a freezer at -80°C for 12 min and then centrifuged at 1900 × g for 45 min. After supernatant was discarded by gently inverting the plate, the plate was
centrifuged upside down on a paper towel at 40 × g for 1
min to remove the remaining ethanol. The pellets were
washed with 120 µl of 70% ethanol. The plate was centrifuged at 1900 × g for 12 min and the ethanol was discarded by gently inverting the plate. The plate was
centrifuged upside down on a paper towel at 40 × g for 1
min and then dried in the laminar flow hood for 10 min.
The dried, purified PCR product is ready to be used as
template in sequencing reactions.

Sequencing of PCR products
Sequencing reactions contained 40–50 ng PCR product as
template, 1 µl for ABI 384-well plate (1.5 µl for 96-well
PCR plate in parenthesis, thereafter the same) of 5×
sequencing buffer, 1 µl (1 µl) of 5.2 µM primer (primers
as used in PCR reactions), and 0.4 µl (1 µl) of BigDye reaction mix in a total volume of 6 µl (10 µl). The sequencing
reaction was carried out using an ABI 384-well plate in a
PTC-200 DNA engine thermocycler or a 96-well PCR plate
in a PTC-100 thermocycler (MJ Research, Inc., Waltham,
MA, USA). Following 5 min of denaturation at 94°C, 60
cycles were performed with 10 s at 94°C, 10 s at 55°C, 4
min at 60°C, and a final extension step of 10 min at 60°C.
Purification of sequencing reactions using ethanol
precipitation
We added 4.8 µl (8 µl) of double distilled water and 19.2
µl (32 µl) of 95% ethanol to each well of the 384-well
plate (96-well plate) and then mixed thoroughly by pipetting up and down. The plate was incubated in the dark at
room temperature for 30 min and then centrifuged at
1900 × g for 45 min. After discarding supernatant, the
plate was centrifuged upside down on a paper towel at 40
× g for 1 min. The pellets were washed with 35 µl (60 µl)
of 70% ethanol and the plate was centrifuged at 1900 × g
for 15 min. After removing the washing solution, the plate
was centrifuged upside down on a paper towel at 40 × g
for 1 min and then dried in the laminar flow hood (in
dark) for 15 min. Ten microliters of Hi-Di formamide
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) was added to
each well and then the plate was centrifuged briefly, denatured in a PTC-200 or PTC-100 thermocycler at 95°C for
5 min and chilled on ice. The PCR products were
sequenced on a 3100 Genetic Analyser (Applied Biosystems).
Nucleotide sequence analysis
DNA sequences were processed and assembled using our
in-house developed software called SOOMOS v0.6
(Banks, personal communication). Base calling, quality
score generation and low quality sequence removal were
performed with the software PHRED [28] using the 'trim_alt' option. The software CAP3 [29] was used to
assemble the processed reads into contiguous sequences
(contigs). DNA sequence multiple alignment, translation
and identification of open reading frames (ORFs) were
conducted using CLUSTAL W v1.82 [30] and DNAMAN
v3.2 (Lynnon Corp., Vaudreuil-Dorion, Quebec, Canada). MEGA3.1 [31] was used to construct a phylogenetic
tree using the Neighbor-joining method. Bootstrap tests
were performed using 1000 replications.
