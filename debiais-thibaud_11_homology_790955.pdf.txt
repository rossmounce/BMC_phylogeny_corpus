Abstract
Background: Teeth and tooth-like structures, together named odontodes, are repeated organs thought to share a
common evolutionary origin. These structures can be found in gnathostomes at different locations along the body:
oral teeth in the jaws, teeth and denticles in the oral-pharyngeal cavity, and dermal denticles on elasmobranch
skin. We, and other colleagues, had previously shown that teeth in any location were serially homologous because:
i) pharyngeal and oral teeth develop through a common developmental module; and ii) the expression patterns of
the Dlx genes during odontogenesis were highly divergent between species but almost identical between oral and
pharyngeal dentitions within the same species. Here we examine Dlx gene expression in oral teeth and dermal
denticles in order to test the hypothesis of serial homology between these odontodes.
Results: We present a detailed comparison of the first developing teeth and dermal denticles (caudal primary
scales) of the dogfish (Scyliorhinus canicula) and show that both odontodes develop through identical stages that
correspond to the common stages of oral and pharyngeal odontogenesis. We identified six Dlx paralogs in the
dogfish and found that three showed strong transcription in teeth and dermal denticles (Dlx3, Dlx4 and Dlx5)
whereas a weak expression was detected for Dlx1 in dermal denticles and teeth, and for Dlx2 in dermal denticles.
Very few differences in Dlx expression patterns could be detected between tooth and dermal denticle
development, except for the absence of Dlx2 expression in teeth.
Conclusions: Taken together, our histological and expression data strongly suggest that teeth and dermal
denticles develop from the same developmental module and under the control of the same set of Dlx genes.
Teeth and dermal denticles should therefore be considered as serial homologs developing through the initiation of
a common gene regulatory network (GRN) at several body locations. This mechanism of heterotopy supports the
‘inside and out’ model that has been recently proposed for odontode evolution.

Background
Teeth and tooth-like structures, together designated as
odontodes, are thought to be serial homologs: they are
repeated mineralized units composed of dentine and
enamel, or enameloid, surrounding a pulp cavity [[1,2],
see for review: [3]]. Odontodes can be found in various
locations on the body of extant gnathostomes, such as
teeth in jaws and different bones in the oral and

pharyngeal cavity, but also as dermal denticles (also
called placoid scales) on the body surface in chondrichthyans [4]. Teeth (oral or pharyngeal) contrast with
denticles (pharyngeal or dermal) in their ability to
regenerate through a typical renewing process [5]. There
has been a long and recently revitalized debate concerning the origin and evolution of odontodes. Due to their
mineralized composition, they are well preserved in the
fossil record and a diversity of odontodes has been
described in fossil and extant taxa belonging to gnathostomes: dermal denticles in thelodonts or heterostracans,
pharyngeal denticles/teeth in thelodonts, ornaments on
dermal bones of placoderms or coelacanths, or the

earliest oral teeth described in placoderms [6]. More
controversial are the pharyngeal denticles/teeth found in
conodont animals that are currently considered to have
diverged early from other vertebrates [7,8]. The longheld view [1] that oral teeth first evolved by the cooption of dermal denticles at the oral margin when jaws
evolved (the outside-in hypothesis) has been challenged
by reconsideration of these fossil data. Because pharyngeal denticles may have arisen before oral teeth and
because both structures share a common organization,
Smith and Coates [9,10] favoured a recruitment of the
gene regulatory network (GRN) responsible for pharyngeal teeth development from the pharynx to the jaw in
early gnathostomes (the inside-out hypothesis). This
model has been supported by morphological and molecular data gained in teleosts: pharyngeal tooth development has been compared to that of the mouse oral
teeth, showing that similar signalling and transcription
factors are expressed during oral and pharyngeal odontogenesis [11-13]. However, detailed comparison of
expression patterns between zebrafish pharyngeal and
mouse oral tooth development showed differences and
some molecular markers are specific for mouse oral
(Pax9 [13,14]) or zebrafish pharyngeal (eve1 [15]) odontogenesis. Additional studies have focused on comparative analysis between oral and pharyngeal dentitions
within a given organism. They showed that, in extant
teleost fish, teeth in the jaw or in the pharynx develop
through similar gene expression patterns [11,16-18].
These results support the hypothesis that a single developmental GRN is initiated at different locations to make
up oral and pharyngeal teeth through a simple mechanism of heterotopy [18]. These studies led to a more
comprehensive scenario about odontode origin and evolution (named the “inside and out” model) that postulates serial homology between all gnathostome
odontodes, as defined by the sharing of a common GRN
for their development [19]. Oral teeth, pharyngeal teeth/
denticles, and dermal denticles would then belong to
this odontode group, developmentally characterized by:
(i) the presence of a neural-crest derived mesenchyme;
(ii) any epithelium able to respond to a mesenchyme
signal [19].
In order to test the “inside and out” model, we searched
for both developmental and genetic similarities between
dermal denticles and oral teeth in the dogfish, Scyliorhinus canicula. In this species, histological observations
support that tooth and dermal denticle development display similarities with that of osteichthyans [20,21].
Among the different subsets of dermal denticle described
during dogfish embryogenesis by Mellinger and Wrisez
[22], we chose to work on the earliest developing ones,
the caudal primary scales. They are located at the very tip
of the tail, develop from caudal to rostral, are clearly

observable in 28 mm long embryos, and are organised as
four bilateral lines (two dorsal and two ventral lines with
usually ten and eight scales respectively). Currently, only
few expression data have been described for tooth and
dermal denticles development in chondrichthyans: Shh
[23], Epha4 [24], Runx1 and Runx3 [25], each gene showing a similar expression pattern in both structures. These
expression patterns were not characterized on histological sections, therefore the tissue-specific transcriptional
dynamics (epithelium vs mesenchyme) cannot be compared between structures or to other gnathostome species. To test the hypothesis of serial homology between
tooth and dermal denticle development, we have characterised the expression of all Dlx gene family members
identified in the dogfish, following a strategy that already
allowed us to propose that a single GRN is involved in
both oral and pharyngeal teeth in medaka [18]. This gene
family represents a paradigmatic genetic marker to test if
one or two independent GRN are involved in tooth-like
structures because: (i) this gene family includes at least
six members in gnathostomes, transcribed with different
expression patterns during tooth development in the
mouse [26,27] and teleosts [12,18,28], and (ii) contrary to
the variability of Dlx patterns between species, the regulation of Dlx expression patterns is not dissociated
between the different dentitions within a given organism
[18].
We show here that the first developing teeth and caudal primary scales form through four common typical
stages that correspond to the common stages we previously identified for oral and pharyngeal odontogenesis
in mouse and teleosts [12,17]. We have identified six
Dlx genes in the dogfish and analysed their expression
patterns in teeth and caudal primary scales at the histological level. Three of them showed strong transcription
in both structures (Dlx3, Dlx4 and Dlx5) whereas lower
transcription levels could be detected for Dlx1 in dermal
denticles and teeth, and for Dlx2 in dermal denticles.
We observed very little difference in the transcription
patterns of a given Dlx gene between teeth and caudal
primary scales, except for the lack of Dlx2 transcription
specifically in tooth buds. These results strongly suggest
that a single set of Dlx genes is involved in oral tooth
and dermal denticle development in the dogfish and
therefore strongly support the hypothesis of serial
homology between these odontodes. In this context, we
propose that Dlx genes belong to a core set of developmental genes involved in all odontode development in
gnathostomes. Our results imply that the GRN involved
in odontode formation could have been initiated at several location (skin, mouth, oral cavity, pharynx) by simple heterotopy during the course of evolution and
therefore represent the first detailed molecular support
for the “inside and out” model.

Results
Tooth and dermal denticle development

As mentioned by Mellinger and Wrisez [22] the first
developing dermal denticles (caudal primary scales) and
teeth could be observed at the very tip of the tail and
the lower jaw, respectively (Figure 1A, insets). In order
to follow the pattern of mineralization in the first developing teeth and dermal denticles, jaws and tails

dissected from dogfish embryos measuring from 2 cm
to 9 cm were stained with alizarin red (Figure 1B-F). At
the tip of the tail, buds of caudal primary scales were
first observable in 2.5 cm long embryos. As previously
described [22], caudal scale development progressed in a
posterior to anterior wave in the terminal part of the
tail: 3 cm-long embryos showed alizarin red staining
only in the very caudal scales while very young scale

buds were still at early stage of development in the anterior part of the primary scale-forming area (Figure 1BC). In 3.4 cm long embryo, four scales were mineralized
in the dorsal and ventral parts of the tail (not shown).
In 4 cm long (not shown) and older embryos, the full
set of caudal primary scales was stained with alizarin
red (Figure 1A, D,) although the most rostral scales
were not erupted yet (not shown). We chose to name
these scales Dorsal or Ventral Caudal Scales (dcs or vcs)
respectively -1 to -10 and -1 to -8, from caudal to rostral: number refers to the rank of apparition during
development, but few variations in scale number were
observed between specimens.
The detailed pattern of tooth development was difficult to identify by alizarin red staining: the first mineralized tooth could be detected in embryos reaching 6 cm
long while there were at least five on each quadrant in 7
cm long embryos (Figure 1A, E). Despite some individual variations, the first tooth bud generally appeared
lateral to the symphysis, and then two other tooth buds
developed on both sides of the first tooth. Additional
teeth subsequently developed on the jaw margin, from

the symphyseal (distal) portion towards the articulation
(proximal). New tooth buds also developed between
teeth of the first row, in a more posterior second row of
teeth, starting in 7.5 cm long embryo (Figure 1F). A
third row of tooth buds was observable in 8.5 cm long
embryos (not shown).
Histological characterization of tooth and dermal denticle
developmental stages

In order to depict the modifications of the mesenchymal
and epithelial compartments through tooth and dermal
denticle development, we performed histological sections and Nissl stain (cresyl violet - thionin) coloration
on dissected tails of 3 cm long embryos and on lower
jaws for embryos ranging from 4 cm to 5.5 cm long
(Figure 2).
The first developing oral tooth and caudal primary
scale buds showed the same successive cellular and histological stages that those previously shown to be common between oral and pharyngeal tooth development in
osteichthyans [12,17]. In addition, cellular and histological aspects of scale bud development were similar to

tooth bud stages. In both structures, the early morphogenesis stage (EM) started with the placode formation:
the shape of odontogenic epithelial cells changed from
cubic to prismatic and the underlying mesenchyme
began to condensate (Figure 2A, F). At late morphogenesis stage (LM), the epithelium progressively folded and
enclosed the mesenchymal compartment resulting in a
bell-shaped bud. At that stage, we could distinguish
between early LM stage when the epithelium started to
fold (Figure 2B, G) and late LM stage when the epithelium fold was more pronounced and the bud exhibited a
typical bell shape (Figure 2C, H). The third stage, ED
(early differentiation), was characterized by a constriction that could be observed at the basis of the bell on
both scale and tooth buds (Figure 2D, I). During the last
stage, LD (late differentiation), epithelial cells had their
nucleus shifted towards the apical pole and showed
secreting vesicles in their basal cytoplasm. The first
signs of matrix deposition confirmed that ameloblasts
were fully differentiated (Figure 2E, J). Differentiation of
the odontoblasts was not included in this analysis as no
histological sign could be identified showing their synthesis activity. These observations are summarised in the
diagram in Figure 2K.
Overall expression of Dlx genes in first forming teeth and
dermal denticles

Two segments for each Dlx coding sequences were
amplified from the dogfish genome by degenerate PCR
based on the six Dlx sequences identified in Triakis
semifasciata [29]. These segments were concatenated
and phylogenetic analyses were performed to check
their orthology to gnathostome Dlx1 to Dlx6 (see Additional file 1). The amplified sequences were used to
synthesize anti-sense RNA probes against the Dlx
mRNAs in the dogfish (Additional file 2).
We performed in situ hybridizations on dissected tails
of 2.5 cm to 3 cm long embryos (stage 29-31) and on
lower jaws for embryos ranging from 4 cm to 5.5 cm
long, in order to describe gene expression in the first
developing teeth and caudal primary scales through
their whole developing process. Transcripts were
detected at high levels in both structures for three out
of six Dlx genes: Dlx3, Dlx4 and Dlx5 (Figure 3E-J).
Lower levels of expression could be detected with the
Dlx1 and Dlx2 probes in developing caudal primary
scales, and with Dlx1 probes in developing teeth (Figure
3A-D). Dlx6 transcripts were never detected, either in
tooth or scale buds (not shown).

expression patterns during the development of dermal

denticles in the dogfish, we prepared histological sections
of the whole-mount hybridized tails, and assigned each
caudal primary scale bud to one of the four stages of
development described in Figure 2. Caudal primary scale
development lasts over weeks and expression patterns
may change along a given developmental stage. We
observed as many buds as possible for each stage, and
separated the LM into an early and a late LM, in order to
obtain a more detailed view of the dynamic changes of
expression patterns. For a given probe, the expression
dynamic is identical in at least the sixteen first caudal primary scales (four first dorsal and ventral caudal scales on
each lateral side), so the values given for each stage in the
following paragraph result from pooling together our
observations as summarized in Table 1.
During caudal primary scale development, we detected
low levels of Dlx3 transcripts in the thickened

Data are calculated as the number of buds with positive staining out of the number of observed buds (see legend of Figure 2 for stage name abbreviations)

epithelium of all bud placodes (EM, n = 25/25, Figure
4A). Dlx3 transcripts were then detected at higher levels
in the epithelial compartment of both the LM stage and
ED stage (n = 28/28 and n = 26/26, respectively, Figure
4B, C). Finally, transcription of Dlx3 was detected only
in the epithelial layer in the beginning of the LD stage
(n = 28/28, Figure 4D). Dlx3 transcripts were detected
in the mesenchyme in only some of the scale buds during the LM stage (n = 16/28): early LM group showed
both negative and positive buds (n = 7 positive out of
19 early LM) while positive staining was always observed
in late LM buds (n = 9/9, Figure 4B). Transcription of
Dlx3 was therefore progressively initiated during the
beginning of the LM stage. Dlx3 transcripts were apparent in the mesenchyme of ED scale buds (n = 20/26)
but undetectable in LD stages, showing a negative regulation of Dlx3 during the LD stage (Figure 4C-D).
Transcripts of Dlx4 were detected with the same
expression pattern: in the epithelium of caudal primary
scale buds during the EM (n = 20/20, Figure 4E), LM (n
= 65/65, Figure 4F), ED (n = 36/36, Figure 4G) and LD
(n = 22/22, Figure 4H) stages and in the mesenchyme of
scale buds at the LM (34/65), ED (31/36) and LD (n =
6/22). Again, during the LM stage, positive staining was
mainly observed in more late LM buds (n = 29 positive
out of 30 late LM stage, Figure 4F) while positive buds
were rarely observed in the early LM group (n = 5 positive out of 35 early LM). Positive staining in the
mesenchyme of LD stages was more frequently observed
in less developed buds, suggesting that Dlx4 expression
is turned off early during LD.
We also detected Dlx5 transcripts in the epithelium of
caudal primary scale bud during the four stages of
development (EM, n = 18/18; LM, n = 53/53; ED n =
35/35; LD, n = 26/26), and in the mesenchymal compartment of the LM (n = 20/53 positive, of which n =
20 in the late LM stages out of 26 late LM buds), ED (n
= 35/35) and LD (n = 13/26) stages (Figure 4I-L).
Histological sections on hybridized tails revealed no
detectable expression of Dlx6 at any stage (not shown),
while Dlx1 and Dlx2 transcripts were detected at low
intensity (Figure 4M-T). We used these same Dlx

probes on whole-mount embryos at early stage of organogenesis (see Additional file 3), and could get strong
signals for every Dlx genes here identified (note that
probe lengths are equivalent for all six genes). We concluded that our results with Dlx1 and Dlx2 probes were
not due to experiment or probe artefact, but most likely
were a consequence of low expression levels for these
two genes during caudal primary scale development.
Dlx1 transcripts were detected in the epithelium of scale
buds at the LM (n = 5/16, all of them from the late LM
group, 10 late LM buds), ED (n = 19/34) and LD (n =
29/34) stages as well as in the mesenchyme of ED (n =
11/34) scale buds (Figure 4M-P), showing a progressive
up-regulation of Dlx1 in the late LM/early ED stage.
Dlx2 transcripts were detected in the epithelium of caudal primary scale buds at the EM (n = 11/13), LM (n =
31/36), ED (n = 16/28) and LD (n = 9/11) stages. Dlx2
expression was also detected in the mesenchymal compartment of scale buds during LM (n = 23/36) stage,
most of the positive buds being in the late LM group (n
= 17 out of 19 late LM buds). Transcripts were then
detected during ED (n = 27/28) stage but undetectable
in LD (Figure 4Q-T), showing activation of Dlx2 transcription during the LM stage and down-regulation
early in the LD stage. The dynamics of each Dlx gene
expression in the epithelial and mesenchymal compartments of primary scale buds are graphically illustrated
in Figure 5A and 5C.
Tissue specific expression of Dlx genes during tooth
development

As described for dermal denticles, we pooled our observations for the eight first teeth (four first teeth on each
hemi-jaw) and summarized our results in Table 2. During tooth development, Dlx3, Dlx4 and Dlx5 transcription started in the epithelial compartment of EM buds
and was maintained in LM, ED and LD (Figure 6A-L
and Figure 5B). Expression in the mesenchymal compartment started during the LM stage (Dlx3, n = 17/31;
Dlx4, n = 14/22; Dlx5, n = 10/37) and most of the positive buds were found in the late LM group (Dlx3, n =
13/17, Figure 6B; Dlx4, n = 10/10, Figure 6F; Dlx5, n =

10/17, Figure 6J and 5D). Expression in the mesenchymal compartment was maximum for Dlx3 and Dlx4
during the ED stage (n = 12/18 and n = 13/13, respectively, Figure 6C, G and 5D) but down regulation of
their expression was apparent during the LD stage (positive tooth buds: n = 7/13 for Dlx3, Figure 6D, and n =
7/21 for Dlx4, Figure 6H and 5D). Dlx5 transcripts were
detected in the mesenchyme of some of the tooth buds
at the ED stage (n = 14/20, Figure 6K) and was maximal
in LD stage buds (n = 11/14, Figure 6L and 5D).

Expression of Dlx2 and Dlx6 could not be significantly
detected by in situ hybridization followed by histological
sections. Among 42 Dlx2 hybridized teeth, we were able
to detect a very weak signal in the epithelium during
the LM stage of six developing tooth buds. We decided
to consider that these data were not significant, but we
cannot exclude that the level of Dlx2 transcription was
too low to be detected by the in situ hybridization technique. On the contrary, Dlx1consistently showed low
levels of expression in developing tooth buds: transcripts

consequence, we postulate here that all odontodes,
whatever their location, develop through four common
successive stages including the formation of a placode
(EM), shaping of the bud (LM), differentiation of ameloblasts and odontoblasts (ED) (as defined in osteichthyans and as deduced from the observation of fully
functional ameloblasts in LD buds in the dogfish), and
matrix deposition (LD). Similar organization and composition of the fully developed teeth and dermal denticles, as well as similar stages of development, support
the hypothesis of serial homology between epithelial
mineralized structures.

development (EM, n = 5/5, Figure 6M; LM, n = 25/26,
Figure 6N; ED, n = 12/12, Figure 6O; LD, n = 6/6, Figure 6P; see also Figure 5B), and transient expression in
the mesenchyme of ED buds could be observed (n = 7/
12, Figure 6O and 5D).

Discussion
Dermal denticle and tooth development progress
through common developmental stages

It has long been considered that oral teeth and dermal
denticles display developmental similarities [1-3]. The
histological data we obtained for embryonic oral tooth
and caudal primary scale development in the dogfish are
in accordance with those obtained previously in other
elasmobranch species or at later stages of dogfish development [20,21]. In addition, our morphological and histological observations show that teeth and scales share
morphogenetic similarities through four developmental
stages, which are also shared with mammalian oral teeth
and teleost pharyngeal or oral teeth [12,17,30]. As a

Serial homology of odontodes is molecularly supported
by non-dissociation of Dlx expression patterns in caudal
primary scales and teeth

To further explore the potential link of serial homology
between odontodes we analysed the expression pattern
of six Dlx genes in Scyliorhinus canicula. We assumed
that these six genes constitute the whole set of Dlx
genes in the dogfish, which also was the probable ancestral state in gnathostomes [29], even if we cannot
exclude that individual duplications occurred in the dogfish lineage. No expression of Dlx6 could be detected in
either tooth or scale buds. Dlx3, Dlx4 and Dlx5 were
expressed in the epithelial compartment during all four
common stages of caudal primary scale and tooth development (Figure 5). In the mesenchymal compartment,
transcription of Dlx3, Dlx4 and Dlx5 was initiated during the LM stage and then down-regulated shortly after
the ED stage for Dlx3 and Dlx4 while expression of
Dlx5 was still on during the LD stage. The expression
dynamics of each of these three genes show only subtle
differences between caudal primary scale and tooth.
First, more than 40% of the tooth buds we examined
show no transcription of Dlx5 in the epithelium during
the initiation of expression at EM stage whereas it is
expressed in the epithelium of all caudal primary scale
buds (Figure 5A and 5B). Similarly, Dlx5 transcription
in the mesenchyme is never detected in 100% of tooth
buds as it is in scale buds (Figure 5C and 5D). Second,
the dynamic of transcription of Dlx3 is identical in the
epithelium of both tooth and caudal primary scale

Figure 6 Histological analysis of Dlx gene expression patterns during tooth development. Transversal sections of hybridized lower jaws of
4 cm to 5.5 cm long embryos illustrating the expression patterns of Dlx3 (A-D), Dlx4 (E-H), Dlx5 (I-L) and Dlx1 (M-P) during the development of
oral teeth. Lower jaws of 4 cm long embryos (A, I and M), 4.3 cm (E), 4.5 cm (B, F, and J), 4.6 cm (G, N and O), 5 cm (C, D and K), 5.1 cm (P), 5.4
cm (H) and 5.5 cm (L). We illustrate only the late LM stage when Dlx genes are predominantly expressed in the mesenchyme of tooth buds.
Legends are as in Figure 2 and 4. Scale bar: 25 μm.

(Figure 5A and 5B) but the expression in the mesenchyme at ED is detectable in all scale buds stage but only
in about 80% of the tooth buds (Figure 5C and 5D).
Expression of Dlx1 was also similar in the mesenchymal
compartment of both caudal primary scale and tooth
buds, with transient expression during the ED stage.
However, the Dlx1 expression pattern showed heterochrony in the epithelial compartment as transcription
started during the LM stage in scale buds, while it was
already active in the EM stage in tooth buds. Note that
Dlx1 signal was very weak compared to Dlx3, Dlx4 and
Dlx5 and we cannot exclude that Dlx1 expression was
too weak to be detected during the early morphogenesis
stages. The main difference observed in this study is the
complete lack of expression of Dlx2 during tooth development, while the expression dynamic of this gene was
similar (although weaker) to those of Dlx3 and Dlx4
during scale bud development. In conclusion, we show
that the tissue specific expression patterns of each Dlx
genes are nearly identical (except for Dlx2) during oral

tooth and dermal denticle development in the dogfish.
Taken together with our previous data on oral and
pharyngeal dentitions, the results presented here show
that the Dlx genes expression patterns did not undergo
dissociation between odontodes (teeth, denticles, scales)
that form at different locations (mouth, pharynx, skin)
in a given species. Therefore, all odontodes of a given
organism appear to be serially homologous because they
bud through the redeployment of common developmental stages associated with a similarly regulated set of Dlx
genes.
Different Dlx expression patterns during odontode
development among jawed vertebrates

In order to gain insights into the evolution of Dlx
expression patterns during gnathostome odontode
development we compared our results with those published in mouse [26], zebrafish [12] and medaka [18]. A
summary of expression patterns published for the
mouse Mus musculus (m), zebrafish Danio rerio (d),

medaka Oryzias latipes (o) and dogfish Scyliorhinus
canicula (s) are presented in Table 3. Note that the
results recently obtained for Dlx expression during pharyngeal tooth development in an African cichlid (Astatotilapia burtoni) [28] were consistent with what had
previously described for Dlx expression in the medaka
and were therefore omitted in the Table 3 in order to
clarify the analysis. Contrasting with the non dissociation of Dlx expression patterns in odontodes within a
given species (this work and [18]), the set of genes
expressed varies highly between species: Dlx1 is never
expressed during zebrafish or medaka odontogenesis
while Dlx6 is not expressed during dogfish or zebrafish
odontogenesis. This observation suggests that a specific
combination of Dlx genes was not strictly constrained
during gnathostome evolution, probably because the
redundancy between the different paralogs favoured
function shuffling. On the other hand, Dlx2, 3, 4, and 5
are transcribed in all three species even though their
expression patterns vary, especially in the epithelial
compartment. Common points are restricted to: (i) early
epithelial transcription for Dlx3 (EM); (ii) mesenchymal
transcription for all four genes during LM and ED (note
two exceptions, no expression of dlx4b in the mesenchyme of LM buds in medaka, no expression of dlx3b in
the mesenchyme of ED buds in zebrafish); (iii) late (LD)
mesenchymal transcription for Dlx5. Given the homology relationship proposed between gnathostome odontodes, these similar features might be inherited from the
gnathostome last common ancestor (see the ancestral
expression pattern, hypothesis a, in Figure 7). Another
trend is highlighted with this comparison: expression of
Dlx3 and Dlx5 in the epithelium at all stages is observed
in all species but the mouse (except for Dlx3 expression
in EM stage).
This may be interpreted as a specific loss in the lineage leading to the mouse (sarcopterygian), and could
even be viewed as a single evolutionary event if one

considers that the epithelial expression of Dlx3 and
Dlx5 is up-regulated by one single activator. If considered as a single evolutionary event, the most parsimonious scenario to explain these data would be that Dlx3
and Dlx5 were transcribed in the epithelium of odontode buds at all stages in the gnathostome last common
ancestor, and that this trait was lost secondarily in the
sarcopterygian lineage leading to the mouse (see hypothesis b, in Figure 7). This result could be correlated to
the different roles taken by the epithelial compartment
in sarcopterygians as opposed to non-sarcopterygians
[31]. In non-sarcopterygians (chondrichthyans and actinopterygians), the outer-most layer of mineralized tissue
(enameloid) is synthesized by a cooperation between the
mesenchymal (neural-crest derived odontoblasts) and
the epithelial (ameloblasts) compartments [32]. On the
contrary, the sarcopterygian outer mineralized layer
(best described in amniotes) is composed of enamel,
which has been showed to be synthesized exclusively
from the epithelial layer of ameloblasts with specific
secretory characteristics [33].
Another prominent result is the lack of early Dlx2
expression (during EM stage) in the mesenchyme of
tooth and dermal denticle buds in the dogfish. This
early expression in the mesenchymal compartment was
observed in the mouse, zebrafish and medaka, and is a
specificity of the Dlx2 orthologs. Two equi-parsimonious
scenarios can be proposed: (i) the early mesenchymal
expression of Dlx2 is a novelty acquired in the last common ancestor of bony fish only; (ii) the early mesenchymal expression of Dlx2 is an ancestral gnathostome
characteristic, and it has been lost in the chondrichthyan
lineage (hypotheses c1 and c2 in Figure 7). Note that the
lack of Dlx2 expression in dogfish teeth is most probably a derived state (hypothesis d in Figure 7) as Dlx2
expression is detected in dogfish scales. Other data presented in Table 3 do not allow to propose one most
parsimonious scenario for expression pattern evolution:

characteristic leading to convergence (mouse (m) +
medaka (o), or zebrafish (d) + dogfish (s)).

Conclusion
Here, we present a detailed comparison of tooth and
dermal denticle development in the dogfish that show
that odontodes should accurately be considered as serial
homologous structures. Indeed in a given species, the
development of the different odontodes involves (i) the
localised redeployment of the same developmental
stages, and (ii) the localised redeployment of the same
Dlx expression patterns (but Dlx2). We reasoned that, if
an ancestral regulation of Dlx expression had dissociated
and evolved independently in the different odontodes
after its cooption at different locations, there should be
more differences between expression patterns when
comparing structures in one organism (serial homology)
than when comparing homologous structures between
extant gnathostomes (specific homology). However, we
observe more divergence between the Dlx expression
patterns of different species than between serial homologous structures within a species such as dogfish teeth
and dermal denticles (see Table 3) or teleost oral and
pharyngeal teeth, as shown in the Additional file 4. We

conclude that the reiterated expression of the dynamic
Dlx patterns in teeth and dermal denticles within a
given organism reveals that the different odontodes
form from the reiterated expression of a single GRN.
Our results therefore provide the first detailed molecular
supports for the “inside and out” model [19] that propose that all odontodes are serially homologous structures that form through the control of a common
odontode gene regulatory network (oGRN). This ancestral oGRN may include, in addition to the Dlx family,
several other genes such as Shh, Epha4, and Runx, that
were shown to be expressed during both scale and tooth
development in chondrichthyans [23-25], and during
oral and/or pharyngeal tooth development in mouse
and/or teleost fish [34,35]. The evolutionary scenario for
the relative time of appearance of the different odontodes depends on the phyletic relationships between fossil agnathans such as conodonts and thelodonts, extant
agnathans, and extant gnathostomes, which remain controversial [7,8,36]. Our results support the hypothesis
that the GRN involved in the development of serially
homologous odontodes has not dissociated over
gnathostome evolution. This implies that, during the
course of evolution, the diversity of gnathostome odontodes arose from independent gains of expression

Debiais-Thibaud et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:307

territories of a single ancestral GRN by simple heterotopy. Therefore, molecular developmental data would
not allow comparing odontodes in order to evaluate
their divergence over evolutionary time. As a consequence, only additional paleontological data can shed a
new light on the evolutionary events leading to the
diversity of odontodes.

Histological sectioning

Dissected jaws and tails from embryos stored in methanol at -20°C were put through several baths of absolute
ethanol, then in butanol and finally embedded in paraplast for 10 μm cross-sections. Sections were then
coloured with Nissl stain (cresyl violet - thionin).
Whole mount in situ hybridizations

Methods
Animals

Dogfish (Scyliorhinus canicula) embryos were obtained
from the Station de biologie marine (Roscoff, France,
CNRS and MNHN). All embryos were maintained at
17°C in sea water until they reach the correct developmental stage, defined by their total length. They were
dissected and then fixed 48 hours at 4°C in a phosphate
buffered saline solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde
(PFA). Embryos were then dehydrated in methanol and
stored at -20°C.

Whole mount in situ hybridizations were performed
according to standard protocol [24] using two antisens
RNA probes for each assay on dissected jaws (from 4 to
5.5 cm embryos long) or tails (from 2.5 to 3 cm
embryos long). Proteinase K treatments (10 μg/mL)
were adapted for dissected jaws and tails: 30 min at
room temperature for tails, twice 30 min for jaws. The
colour detection step was performed using the NBTBCIP reaction. We assayed this protocol on at least four
embryos for each developmental stage and with positive
control (earlier embryo with known restricted expression pattern with the same probe, see Additional file 3).

Alizarin red staining

Whole-mount embryos stored in methanol were progressively transferred in 0.5% KOH solution. They were
then coloured over-night in an alizarin red solution
(0.001%) in 0.5% KOH at room temperature. After their
progressive transfer to glycerol, they were photographed
under bright field.
Double alcian blue and alizarin red staining

Whole-mount embryos (more than 5 cm long) were
fixed in buffered 10% formaldehyde for a day, then
rinsed in distilled water and transferred to 70% ethanol
for storage. They were stained in filtered alcian blue
solution (alcian blue 200 mg/L in 70% ethanol-30% glacial acetic acid) for 48 hours, rinsed in decreasing ethanol bathes, to distilled water, and then in a 30%
saturated sodium borate solution. They were then
digested in a trypsin solution (1% in 30% saturated
sodium borate solution, renewed when blue) until the
specimen is cleared. Specimens were then transferred in
a 0.5% KOH solution to be stained with alizarin red.
Cloning Dlx coding sequences

Amplification of the first and third exon of each Dlx
coding sequence was made with degenerated primers
designed on the published sequences of Triakis semifasciata Dlx genes [29]. Dlx probe positions are shown on
Additional file 2, and primer sequences are given in
Additional file 5. PCR products were cloned in pGEM-T
Easy vector (Promega). Antisense RNA digoxigenin-UTP
probes were prepared using SP6 or T7 polymerase,
according to the orientation of the insert in the plasmid.

Expression pattern analysis

The dissected jaws and tails were post-fixed in 4% PFA
after whole mount in situ hybridization, then cleared
and stored in glycerol at 4°C to be photographed under
bright field. Whole-mount hybridized dissections were
put through several baths of absolute ethanol, then in
butanol and finally embedded in paraplast for 10 μm
cross-sections. Negative whole-mount detections were
also verified after histological sections.

Additional material
Additional file 1: Assignment of the Dlx probes to their group of
orthologues. In order to assign each Dlx probe to an orthologous
group, phylogenetic analyses were performed. The Dlx gene sequences
of Triakis semifiasciata (leopard shark), Homo sapiens (human), Gallus
gallus (chicken), Xenopus tropicalis (xenopus), Danio rerio (zebrafish) were
retrieved from Ensembl release 49 and GenBank release 164. Multiple Dlx
amino acid sequences were aligned using ClustalX (Thompson et al.
1997) with manual optimization using MUST software (Philippe 1993).
Regions of ambiguous homology were removed. Evolutionary distances
were computed using the Poisson correction and a neighbor-joining tree
was obtained using MEGA4 (Tamura et al. 2007). The robustness of the
tree nodes was estimated by a bootstrap test (1000 replicates). Philippe
