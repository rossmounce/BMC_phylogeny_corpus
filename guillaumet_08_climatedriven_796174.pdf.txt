Abstract
Background: The major impact of Plio-Pleistocene climatic oscillations on the current genetic
structure of many species is widely recognised but their importance in driving speciation remains
a matter of controversies. In addition, since most studies focused on Europe and North America,
the influence of many other biogeographic barriers such as the Sahara remains poorly understood.
In this paper, climate-driven diversification was investigated by using a comparative phylogeographic
approach in combination with phenotypic data in two avian species groups distributed on both sides
of the deserts belt of Africa and Asia. In particular, we tested whether: 1) vicariance diversification
events are concomitant with past climatic events; and 2) current ecological factors (using climate
and competition as proxies) contribute to phenotypic divergence between allopatric populations.
Results: Mitochondrial and nuclear sequence data indicated that the crested and Thekla lark
species groups diverged in the early Pliocene and that subsequent speciation events were
congruent with major late Pliocene and Pleistocene climatic events. In particular, steep increase in
aridity in Africa near 2.8 and 1.7 million years ago were coincident with two north-south vicariance
speciation events mediated by the Sahara. Subsequent glacial cycles of the last million years seem
to have shaped patterns of genetic variation within the two widespread species (G. cristata and G.
theklae). The Sahara appears to have allowed dispersal from the tropical areas during climatic
optima but to have isolated populations north and south of it during more arid phases. Phenotypic
variation did not correlate with the history of populations, but was strongly influenced by current
ecological conditions. In particular, our results suggested that (i) desert-adapted plumage evolved
at least three times and (ii) variation in body size was mainly driven by interspecific competition,
but the response to competition was stronger in more arid areas.
Conclusion: Climatic fluctuations of the Plio-Pleistocene strongly impacted diversification
patterns in the Galerida larks. Firstly, we found that cladogenesis coincides with major climatic
changes, and the Sahara appears to have played a key role in driving speciation events. Secondly,
we found that morphology and plumage were strongly determined by ecological factors
(interspecific competition, climate) following vicariance.

Background
All models of speciation implicitly recognize two steps,
whereby initial divergence is followed by evolution of
reproductive isolation. In the standard allopatric model
(in contrast to ecological speciation models), geographical isolation is viewed as a prerequisite for divergence [1].
While geographical isolation may be due to dispersal or
vicariance (e.g. tectonics), the refuge theory argues that
climate change is generally responsible for the fragmentation of a species range [2]. For populations that remain
isolated a long time, climate-driven vicariance events may
be sufficient for reproductive isolation to evolve by drift
alone [3]. Nevertheless, adaptation to local ecological
conditions in different refuges can also accelerate speciation when divergence affects phenotypic traits involved in
mate choice [1,4-6]. Accordingly, climatic fluctuations of
the Plio-Pleistocene (succession of glacial and interglacial
events) may be expected to produce a stasis-punctuation
model of evolution, where bursts of speciation are caused
by major climatic changes [7-10] (hereafter, the climatedriven speciation hypothesis, from which the muchdebated "LPO" Late Pleistocene Origin model [11] is a
derivative).
However, while there is a consensus around the idea of
past climatic oscillations having been determinant in
shaping the current distribution range and genetic structure of many modern animal and plant species [12,13],
their importance in driving speciation remains a matter of
controversies [14-16], a situation that results from several
factors. Firstly, the timing of speciation events is often
inaccurate or too imprecise [17]. Secondly, despite an
expanding literature on the role of ecology in driving the
patterns of phenotypic differentiation and the levels of
gene flow between sympatric or parapatric populations,
the relationship between ecology and allopatric speciation remains poorly understood [18]. Thirdly, recent analyses suggested that the importance of the Pleistocene for
speciation events might actually vary among regions [16]
and habitats [19,20]. However, the majority of studies
focused on European and North American species, even if
climatic cycles were as pronounced elsewhere [21,22].
In Africa for instance, frequent climatic shifts of moderate
amplitude before 2.8 million years ago (MYA) were followed by three major steplike shifts towards more arid
conditions near 2.8 (± 0.2), 1.7 (± 0.1) and 1.0 (± 0.2)
MYA. Then, the climate changed quite abruptly around
0.9 MYA with an accentuation of amplitude and duration
of climatic cycles (development of 100 KY late Pleistocene
glacial climatic cycles [21,23]). Periods of increased aridity were characterized by a contraction of forests and an
expansion of savannas and deserts [21], and this have
affected the biotas that occupy these biomes. Fossil African bovid and rodent assemblages shifted towards arid-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/32

adapted species between 2.7 and 2.5 MYA, and a further
increase in the relative abundance of arid-adapted bovid
species was noticed in Africa near both 1.7 and 1.0 MYA
[21,23]. Also, these periods correspond to key junctures in
early hominid evolution, including the emergence of the
genus Homo [23]. In addition, some recent phylogeographical studies in Africa revealed a good congruence
between divergence times among species or phylogroups
and the peak of aridification that occurred 1 MYA ([24] for
the African greenbul Andropades tephrolaemus, [25] for the
African montane forest robin Pogonocichla stellata and [26]
for the phytophageous insect Busseola fusca). Furthermore,
several intraspecific radiations appear to have occurred
within the past 200–300 KY, corresponding to the last two
or three major Pleistocene glaciations (e.g. in the hartebeest Alcelaphus buselaphus [7] and in the Akalats of the
genus Shepphardia [27]).
However, generality of these results might be affected by
biases in the current sampling of groups and biomes, with
savanna-dwelling mammals [7,22,28-31] and forest avian
species [24,25,32] being over represented in comparison
with arid regions which are somewhat neglected. As a consequence the role of the Sahara in driving speciation
events is still poorly understood [33,34], while we may
expect that periods of increased aridity, that actually
started more than 3 million years ago [35] and corresponded to an expansion of the Sahara, promoted northsouth vicariance events [36,37]. Since climatic fluctuations appeared to affect arid regions in the Arabian peninsula and south-east Asia (e.g. Thar desert in NE India) in a
similar fashion (i.e. glacial periods were associated with
desert expansion [38-40]), it is further possible that PlioPleistocene climatic fluctuations were responsible for
additional east-west (e.g. sub-Saharan Africa-India) vicariance events.
In this paper, we investigated the applicability of the climate-driven speciation hypothesis to avian populations
distributed around the desert belt in North Africa and Eurasia. In particular, we tested whether (i) vicariance events
were concomitant with Plio-Pleistocene climatic changes
and (ii) current ecological factors (using climate and competition as proxies) contribute to phenotypic divergence
between allopatric populations. We choose the crested
and Thekla lark species complexes as model because: (i)
they have a very large Old World distribution north and
south of the Sahara in Africa, but also to the east within
and beyond the arid belt of Asia; (ii) they show a high
level of phenotypic diversification, resulting in a large
number of described subspecies [41]; (iii) the crested and
the Thekla lark species group have diverged ~3.7 MYA
[42], and thus represent two independent evolutionary
trajectories through Plio-Pleistocene climatic fluctuations.
In addition, they are species of open grounds (semi-

desert, savanna, highland steppes), for which relevant
phylogeographic data in Africa are scarce, particularly in
comparison with mammals and forest birds (see above;
but see [43]).
Prior analyses in the crested lark complex revealed the
existence of two reproductively isolated and essentially
allopatric species (G. cristata and G. randonii). Galerida
randonii is an endemic of central Maghreb while G. cristata
has a much wider distribution [44] (Fig. 1a). Limited geographic sampling further revealed the existence of two distinct genetic groups in G. cristata: cristata has the largest
distribution from western Morocco to the Middle East and
through Eurasia, and possibly also in eastern Sahel. The
senegallensis group was found on both sides of the Saharan
desert, in the western Sahel and in the eastern Maghreb
[44].
The distribution of the Thekla lark is disjoint, with one set
of populations in the western Mediterranean region, and
the other one in the Horn of Africa (Fig. 1b). In addition,
G. malabarica of coastal India might form a superspecies
with the Thekla lark [41]. Since these three sets of populations are currently separated by Arabo-Saharan deserts, we
may speculate that they became isolated following one or
several episodes of increased aridity in these areas (see
above). However, a single study has examined genetic variation in G. theklae, but it was limited to Morocco and did
not detect any phylogeographical structure among five
described subspecies [42]. In this study, important new
sampling (mostly museum specimens, including G. malabarica) and new analyses (phylogenetic dating, population genetics) were used to investigate the evolutionary
history of modern taxa belonging to the crested and
Thekla lark species complexes and its links with past climatic events.
In addition to examining historical patterns of diversification events in these two partially co-distributed species
complexes, phylogenetic and population genetics data
were used to understand the processes which underlie
complex patterns of phenotypic differentiation in these
taxa. In particular, we tested the hypothesis that recurrent
adaptation to similar living environments provides a tenet
for long-standing systematic controversies [41]. By studying traits (e.g. body size, bill shape and coloration) that
are prominent in mate choice in passerine birds [5,45],
this study also brought insights into speciation patterns in
these taxa and biogeographic zones.
Firstly, previous analyses in the crested lark complex
revealed a striking syndrome of body size increase in the
Maghreb for two different lineages [44]. However, previous studies did not make further attempts to explain this
pattern, which could be explained either by climatic effect

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/32

(e.g. James' version of Bergmann's rule, which predicts
larger body size in more arid areas [46]), and/or by interspecific competition (i.e. character displacement in the
Maghreb where crested larks live sympatrically with the
Thekla lark). The design of the present study allowed us to
address the climatic component of the variation (by testing the repeatability of this pattern in the Thekla lark complex) while simultaneously controlling for the possible
influence of interspecific competition (by including both
allopatric and sympatric populations) and phylogenetic
effects (by using a comparative method).
Secondly, subspecies that live in desertic areas tend to
have a very pale sandy plumage, seemingly mainly as a
result of drastic reduction in the amount of melanin deposition in feathers centre of the head, back, wings and
breast [41] (pers. obs.). However, such phenotypic similarity might reflect close phylogenetic relationships rather
than independent adaptation to desert conditions. For
instance, no mtDNA divergence was found between two
desert subspecies of the Thekla lark (aguirrei and carolinae)
in a previous study in Morocco [42]. In this study, phylogenetic differentiation of desert subspecies was investigated for geographically remote populations, both in the
Thekla lark complex (deichleri of S Tunisia versus carolinae
of the Figuig area in Morocco) and in the crested complex
(helenae of Tassili in Algeria versus isabellina of Ennedi,
Chad; see Fig. 1 for locations and Additional file 2 for
illustrations). In addition, a coalescence-based method
was used to investigate the possible influence of gene flow
in establishing similarity between desert subspecies.
In summary, this paper addresses the influence of the climate on speciation and phenotypic variation in two widespread species complexes of larks. Incidentally, this study
should also bring new insights into the biogeography of
poorly-known regions such as the Sahara, and to the phylogenetic status of currently isolated populations in India
or the Horn of Africa.

Results
Phylogeny
As expected, two major groups broadly corresponding to
the Thekla lark complex on one hand, and to the crested
lark complex on the other hand were identified: for
nuclear data, 6–7 mutations were fixed between the two
species complexes, as compared to 0–1 mutation among
sequences within groups, and for mtDNA, both groups
were found to be monophyletic with strong bootstrap
support (BS ≥ 94; Fig. 2; Table 1). However, despite its
Thekla-like morphology, G. malabarica turned out to be a
member of the crested lark complex. This result is supported by identical mtDNA sequences of three different
specimens of G. malabarica (two of them are included in
the 291 bp alignment; see Table 2, while the third one had

a sequence of 244 bp), and by the 115 bp of the β-fibrinogen gene obtained for four different G. malabarica (Table
3): the four specimens shared three mutations that are
diagnostic of crested larks (sites 7, 66 and 82), but they
were not fixed for any mutation diagnostic of the Thekla
lark complex (even if they were polymorphic for one
mutation – at site 20 – that is otherwise diagnostic of the
Thekla lark complex).
Further resolution is revealed by mtDNA data. Within the
crested lark complex, the phylogenetic tree revealed three
monophyletic groups corresponding to three previously
recognized species: G. randonii [42], G. malabarica and G.
cristata (Figs. 2, 3a). Lack of resolution for the basal nodes
is suggestive of a fairly simultaneous vicariant event for

these three species, coincident with the second aridification event at ~1.7 MYA (Table 1, node 6). G. randonii and
G. malabarica show little intraspecific genetic variation,
which might be due to their narrow geographic distribution and/or small sample size (Fig. 1a; Table 4). Within
the more widely distributed G. cristata, three haplotypes
cluster with allopatric distribution could be identified
(Figs. 1a, 2, 3a) (i) the cristata group (monophyletic with
average BS = 88; see Table 1, node 8) is by far the most
widespread, being present throughout Eurasia (from
Korea to Portugal), but also in NE Africa and NW
Morocco; (ii) the senegallensis group (monophyly poorly
supported) is located in the western Sahel and eastern
Maghreb; the type specimen of the subspecies helenae in
the central Sahara clearly belongs to that group (Cri_Al_1

(monophyletic with average BS = 92; Table 1, node 10) is
only found in Kenya.
Within the Thekla lark complex, populations currently
separated by the Sahara form two highly divergent monophyletic assemblages that diverged concomitantly with
the first aridification event at ~2.8 MYA (Fig. 2; Table 1
(node 2) and Table 5). Within G. theklae sensu stricto (i.e.
the Palearctic lineage), we only found a shallow genetic
division among the whole sample (see also Fig. 3b). By

contrast, in the Horn of Africa, we found two old mitochondrial lineages, namely praetermissa and ellioti whose
split coincided with the second aridification event at ~1.7
MYA (Table 1, node 3). They correspond to two previously unrecognized evolutionary units. The sequence
obtained for a single specimen of the race hueii (sampled
in the Bale mountains, south of the Rift valley) turned out
to be most closely related to G. praetermissa, even if it is
quite divergent (estimated divergence time: 1.08 MYA,
coinciding with the third aridification event; see Table 1,
node 4).

match-distribution analyses [95% CI] was t ~ 38 KYA
[0–83] for senegallensis, t ~ 30 KYA [0–64] for theklae and
t ~ 22 KYA [0–42] for cristata. Because expansions are
detected in three distinct lineages that are also the most
widespread (see Fig. 1), and because three independent
and fairly simultaneous selective sweeps appear unlikely,
we feel confident that these patterns reflect demography
and not selection [47].
Test of recurrent gene flow across the Sahara (divergence
between senegallensis populations north and south of the
Sahara) – Eight independent MDIV runs were conducted
and yielded highly consistent results. The data are most
consistent with a non-null period of divergence (i.e. T > 0;
the average mode of T was T = 0.53 ± 0.13; applying the
"standard" calibration of 2%/MY yields t ~ 29 KYA; 95%
CI [2.4–?]), but with complete isolation (M = 0). The latter result is indicated by a strictly decreasing curve for
proba(M|data) as long as the prior for Tmax is set < 3,
which seems reasonable given the estimated mode of T
(see Additional file 4b for a typical run).
Phenotypic evolution
Morphometry
The topology of the tree obtained from the six morphological traits is very different from the genetic one (Shimo-

daira-Hasegawa test, P < 0.001, Figs. 2 and 4). Such a
discrepancy can be explained by two factors: (i) taxa do
not always cluster according to the species complex they
belong to. For instance, G. malabarica cluster with members of the Thekla lark complex and not with the more
closely related G. cristata or G. randonii; and (ii) within
species complexes, populations tend to cluster on the
basis of geographic -and not phylogenetic-affinities, suggesting morphological convergence.
A multiple regression analysis revealed the role of ecological competition and current climate in driving the patterns of body size variation (Table 8, Fig. 5 left). Within
both species complexes, populations tended to evolve a
larger body size in the presence of a competitor and in
more arid areas. However, this latter effect was eclipsed by
a significant interaction between aridity and competition
(i.e. the trends towards larger body size with increasing
aridity is exaggerated in the presence of competition).
Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) were used to
control for phylogenetic relationships between populations (see methods). They yielded significant results consistent with ordinary regression (competition: F1,2 =
200.41, P = 0.0056; interaction between competition and
aridity: F1,2 = 133.44, P = 0.0082). In addition, the significant interaction between species complex and competi-

tion factors (see Table 8) suggested that body size shift in
the presence of competition affects mainly the crested
larks, thus supporting the character displacement hypothesis. However, this latter effect was not found again when
the analysis was limited to males (not shown). In contrast
with these results for body size, neither competition nor
climate explained a significant part of the variation in

cSA (3) - cristata

Color variation
In G. cristata, the three Chadian light-plumaged isabellina
specimens shared the most common haplotype of the
cristata lineage (Cri_MO_6, see Table 4), while the Algerian light-plumaged type specimen of helenae had the
most common senegallensis haplotype (Cri_AL_1). The
hypothesis of reciprocal monophyly of cristata and senegallensis is weakly supported (see mtDNA Phylogeny section).
Nevertheless, MDIV results suggested that they diverged
around 390 KYA (Table 1), seemingly without any subsequent gene flow (at least mtDNA gene flow: MDIV estimate of M is 0 as indicated by a strictly decreasing
likelihood profile; see Additional file 4c), while the origin
of helenae and isabellina within each lineage is probably
much more recent. The cristata lineage mostly includes

dark-plumaged populations, e.g. in S Europe or Turkey
(see Additional file 2 for illustration, and Table 4 for geographic distribution of haplotypes) and the same is true
for the senegallensis lineage (Additional file 2; Table 4; see
also [41] for illustrations of senegallensis in sub-Saharan
Africa). Hence, each subspecies holds widespread haplotypes of two genetic groups that are mainly made of typical/dark populations. Our molecular results are thus
consistent with the hypothesis that several convergence
events explain the evolution of plumage color patterns in
G. cristata.
In G. theklae, all three light-plumaged carolinae from SE
Morocco (Figuig) had haplotypes from the theklae haplogroup (two had The_MO_2, one had The_MO_19). By
contrast, each light-plumaged deichleri of S Tunisia had a

distinct haplotype that belonged either to theklae
(The_MO_2) or to superflua haplogroups (The_TU_1 and
The_TU_3). Rather than incomplete lineage sorting,
MDIV favours a model of recent divergence between populations in Morocco and Tunisia (t ~ 150 KYA, Table 1),
associated with weak but non-null gene flow (M ~ 0.15,
see Additional file 4d). Hence, it is not possible to exclude
a single origin of the light colored plumage that characterizes desertic phenotypes in the Thekla lark.

(early Pliocene) division between members of two wellsupported species groups corresponding to two traditionally recognised species: the Thekla lark and the crested
lark.
All subsequent diversification events were remarkably
congruent with major late Pliocene and Pleistocene climatic events in Africa, particularly steplike shifts towards
more arid conditions near 2.8, 1.7 and 1.0 MYA, and with
radiations in co-distributed unrelated species groups
[21,23] (see also introduction), bringing support to the
climate-driven speciation hypothesis. Periodic expansion
of the Sahara appears to have played a major role in cladogenesis, by repeatedly isolating vicariant populations
respectively north and south of the main desert landmass
(see below), but periods of aridification also impacted
populations of the Thekla lark complex living in the Horn
of Africa, with (i) a split between populations in highland
steppes (praetermissa-hueii) and xeric grasslands (ellioti)
that occurred ~1.8 MYA; (ii) the separation of highland
steppes populations by the Rift valley dated at ~1.1 MYA.
This scenario should of course be refined in the future and
more accurate tests performed. First, the general history of
climate change in Africa as described by DeMenocal
[21,23] shows local or even regional exceptions [48],
which could be taken into account with wider geographical sampling. Perhaps more importantly, the coincidence
between divergence and climatic events rely on an
assumed cytochrome b mutation rate of 2% per MY,
which has not been calibrated for these larks. Although
the widespread use of this rate has been criticized [49],
there is no alternative to date when no fossil record is
available [50], and this rate seems to be largely consistent
among avian groups [11], being also relevant in the single
songbird clade calibrated to date [16]. In any case, if we
except unlikely low values (i.e. less than 1%), all diversifi-

cation events we report would still be consistent with a
late Pliocene or Pleistocene influence, with the possible
exception of the Palearctic/Ethiopian split in the Thekla
lark (see Table 1). Finally, confidence intervals around
estimated values of divergence times are quite large (see
Table 1). In the future, a multilocus approach could be
used to reduce these confidence limits [17].
Prior to this work, the role of past climatic fluctuations
was essentially noticed for savanna-dwelling mammals
and forest avian species (see introduction). The present
study suggests that the same general pattern also applies
for ground-dwelling birds adapted to open habitats (see
also [43] for a study of the ostrich Struthio camelus). Interestingly, the diversification pattern we describe here for
species of steppe-like and montane habitats in and near
the tropics is in accordance with the standard model for
temperate species [51], but differs from what has been
reported for lowland tropical forest species, where most
speciation events seem to predate the late Pliocene and
Pleistocene epochs [19,20] (for detailed examples in African birds, see [24] – genus Andropadus-; [27] – genus Sheppardia-; for a counter-example in forest shrews, see [52]).
Overall, these results highlight the importance of comparative phylogeographic approaches to unravel the factors
underlying diversification processes [53].
(ii) current ecological factors shape phenotypic variation
In agreement with previous reports in these taxa (which
were based on smaller taxonomic and geographic samplings [42,44]), we found overall a strong discordance
between phylogenetic relationships inferred from neutral
molecular markers and phenetic similitude among groups
based on phenotypic data sets. This suggests a major role
for natural selection in driving the patterns of phenotypic
evolution in Galerida larks, especially given that in birds a
strong genetic component has been reported in both morphological traits [54,55] and melanin-based plumage
traits [56,57]. However, the exact contribution of phenotypic plasticity cannot be addressed with present data.
Morphology
The most striking example concerns morphological convergence in the Maghreb. For the crested lark, convergence
is found between G. randonii and both senegallensis and
cristata lineages of G. cristata (group IV of Fig. 4; see also
[44] for previous demonstration of convergence between
G. randonii and senegallensis). For the Thekla lark, convergence is found between theklae and superflua (group II of
Fig. 4). As the trend in both complexes is for increasing
size (Fig. 5 left), this suggested a common, possibly climatic, cause (e.g. James' version of Bergmann's rule,
which predicts larger size in more arid areas [46]). However, a multiple regression analysis indicated that variations in body size – such as the trends towards larger body

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:32

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/32

size in the Maghreb- are mainly driven by interspecific
competitive interactions between sympatric members of
each species complex. Nevertheless, this response to competition is stronger in more arid areas, which is consistent
with the view that phenotypic response to natural selection should be strongest during periods or in areas where
resources are most limiting [58].

plumage to desertic environment [63,64]). For instance
within senegallensis, morphological differences between
populations north and south of the Sahara, which exhibit
only weak and non-significant genetic differentiation
(Table 6), are much larger than morphological differences
found between valid species that belong to widely divergent species complexes (see Figs. 4, 5).

Our analysis also provided some evidence that competition might affect primarily representatives of the crested
lark complex, thereby supporting the character displacement hypothesis (significant species complex by competition
interaction in Table 8). Mitochondrial data suggest that in
G. cristata, the Maghreb was invaded twice (see Guillaumet et al. [44], and discussion below for further
details): 1) by the cristata lineage, from southern Europe
(cEU in Figs. 4 and 5) to the western Maghreb (cMO), and
2) by the senegallensis lineage, from sub-Saharan Africa
(sSA) to eastern Maghreb (sEM). In presumed source areas
(and our corresponding samples, see Additional file 1), G.
cristata is entirely (sSA) or predominantly (cEU) allopatric
with G. theklae. Interestingly, the body size of source G.
cristata populations are strikingly similar to the body size
of Maghreban Thekla lark populations that they encountered as they colonized the area (compare cEU vs tMO,
and sSA vs tTU in Fig. 5 left), pointing towards a possible
causal mechanism for character displacement. However,
we emphasize that further samples will be required to validate this hypothesis (as this effect was lost when the analysis was limited to males).

Phenotypic divergence and speciation
Phylogeographic analyses of the Thekla and especially,
crested lark complexes reveal a now classical history [65]
of multiple fragmentations followed occasionally by the
expansion of some refuge lineages that may lead to secondary contact zones between valid or incipient species
(Fig. 1). While incidental divergence during periods of
isolation may contribute to the speciation process, it is
unlikely to play a dominant role here, given the slow accumulation rate of post-zygotic incompatibilities in birds
(for instance, fertility loss is generally observed after 5 MY,
and rarely before 2 MY [66]). Conversely, rapid phenotypic divergence in response to local ecological conditions
as demonstrated here could induce at least partial prezygotic isolation at secondary contact zones [1], particularly for such passerine birds for which body size and coloration play an important role in mate choice [5,45]. In
the single secondary contact zone studied to date, strong
evidence of reproductive isolation was indeed found
between cristata and randonii in Morocco [42,67].

Color
Like in many other bird species [59,60] (but see [61]), and
in agreement with a previous report in Morocco [42],
plumage variation in Galerida larks was in agreement with
Gloger's rule (paler plumage in more arid regions, see
Additional file 2). Adaptation to desert environments
clearly occurred independently in G. theklae (e.g. ssp.
deichleri) and G. cristata (e.g. ssp. helenae) and probably
several times in G. cristata although further samples are
needed to confirm this. In G. theklae on the other hand, a
single origin of desert-adapted plumage could not be
excluded, as recurrent gene flow was detected among the
two desertic populations investigated.
Tempo of phenotypic evolution
Our data are suggestive of a punctuated-equilibrium
mode of evolution (as suggested in [7] sensu [62]): long
periods of relative phenotypic stasis, as might be exemplified by the Thekla-like morphotype in widely divergent
phylogenetic lineages (group III of Fig. 4; of course, convergence cannot be ruled out) can sometimes be followed
by very rapid episodes of divergence, as a result of e.g. climate-driven adaptation in expanding lineages (morphological convergence in the Maghreb, adaptation of

Role of biogeographic barriers
The Sahara
Very few studies have addressed the role of the Sahara in
driving speciation events [33] (but see [34]). This is particularly true for the last four million years, a period which
is characterized by the onset of arid climatic cycles [35]
that might have favoured speciation. Our results suggest
three different episodes of north-south vicariance during
arid phases of late Pliocene (Palearctic-Ethiopian Thekla
split ~2.8 MA), mid-Pleistocene (G. randonii-G. cristata
split ~1.8 MYA) and late Pleistocene (E Maghreb-Sahel
split in senegallensis ~0.029 MYA).

Rather than simple north-south vicariance between G.
cristata and G. randonii, the star-like phylogenetic relationships among the three species of crested larks (Fig. 2) suggests that the divergence between G. cristata, G. randonii
and G. malabarica occurred fairly simultaneously ~1.8
MYA. While G. malabarica and G. randonii are geographically restricted to, respectively, W coastal India and central
Maghreb, G. cristata is widely distributed in Europe, Asia
and Africa (Fig. 1a). However, a sub-Saharan origin is
likely for the latter given that the highest genetic diversity
is found there (i.e. all three extant genetic lineages that
compose it -cristata, senegallensis and somaliensis- are currently found in sub-Saharan Africa, in contrast to all other

Page 13 of 22

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:32

regions of the world where only one lineage is present; see
Fig. 1a). Taken together, these elements suggests a simple
speciation history in the crested lark species complex: (i)
an ancestral species was distributed in Africa and Asia,
occupying part of the current range of the three species G.
cristata, G. randonii and G. malabarica; (ii) the expansion
of Arabo-Saharan deserts during an arid episode ~1.7
MYA might have led to the formation of three refuge species (i.e. precisely the scenario initially predicted for the
Thekla lark complex): G. malabarica in India, G. randonii
in the Maghreb and G. cristata in sub-Saharan Africa; (iii)
while G. malabarica and G. randonii would have remained
within the limits of their ancient refuge, G. cristata would
have subsequently expanded its range from its sub-Saharan refuge.
In agreement with a previous report [44], our data are
indeed consistent with two independent events of expansion from sub-Saharan Africa in G. cristata: (i) the colonization of the whole Eurasia (as well as Morocco
secondarily from S Spain) from the eastern Sahel refuge
zone (cristata lineage); and (ii) the colonization of the
eastern Maghreb from the western Sahel refuge zone (senegallensis lineage).
A recent range expansion in cristata is indicated by significant Fu's Fs and the star-like phylogeny of haplotypes
(Fig. 3a). Since this taxon is tightly linked with humanmodified habitats in parts of its range (particularly,
towards west of range [68]), Guillaumet et al. [44] proposed that the cristata expansion was facilitated by the
development of agriculture that started around ten thousand years ago [69]. When dating this expansion event by
mismatch analysis we found a slightly higher but still concordant estimate (22 KYA; 95% confidence interval =
0–42 KYA).
Despite the non-significant (even if marginally so) negative Fs value that we found for senegallensis, a recent expansion event in this group is suggested by the star-like
phylogeny of haplotypes (Fig. 3a) and a mismatch distribution that fitted the sudden expansion model. In fact, it
is likely that the signal of expansion has been partly
blurred by subsequent isolation and divergence without
gene flow between populations N and S of the Sahara, as
suggested by MDIV results. We suggest that the Maghreb
was colonized from sub-Saharan Africa because G. cristata
is believed to originate from sub-Saharan Africa (see
above). Furthermore, in the case of a recent range expansion, ancestral haplotypes are more likely to be found
close to the origin of expansion, whereas derived haplotypes are more likely to be found at the leading edge of
range expansion [70]. Such a pattern fits the senegallensis
haplotype network (as already discussed in [44]): two rare
haplotypes found in sub-Saharan Africa tend to occupy an

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/32

internal position in the network (Cri_CH_1 and
Cri_MA_2), while one clearly derived haplotype is only
found in the Maghreb (Cri_TU_1; Fig. 3a). However, we
emphasize that additional sampling in the Maghreb and
sub-Saharan Africa is needed to validate the sub-Saharan
origin of the senegallensis lineage. Colonisation of the
Maghreb may have been favoured by steppe-like vegetation in the Sahara, possibly during the most recent interglacial around 6 KYA [71] (the expansion event for
senegallensis was dated here at ~38 KYA [0–83]). Then,
subsequent aridification of the Sahara led to a contraction
of Saharan populations into a few refugia, particularly in
mountain areas (e.g. helenae), that behave as relic populations (Fig. 1a). This scenario appears compatible with the
estimated time of divergence for populations N and S of
the Sahara (~29 KYA, with a lower bound of 2.4 KYA; see
also Additional file 4) and with two other phylogeographic studies conducted in the lanner falcon Falco biarmicus [36] and in the honeybee Apis mellifera [37], which
also suggest genetic isolation of populations north and
south of the Sahara during arid phases [37].
Our results demonstrate that the Sahara did not constitute
a permanent barrier throughout geological times. The distribution of senegallensis is exemplary, since genetic data
still hold the footprints of a recent expansion in the late
Pleistocene through the current Sahara, followed by fragmentation and divergence without gene flow between a
northern and a southern refuge, as a probable result of
increasingly arid conditions (see above). Interestingly,
Maghreban populations of senegallensis also showed an
accelerated rate of morphological evolution [44] (this
study). Galerida larks thus suggest to us a possible general
mechanism by which glacial cycles affecting the Sahara
might promote speciation in birds and other taxa (see also
[34] for a case of intra-Saharan speciation in Taterillus gerbils attributed to climatic cycles).
E-W vicariance in the Sahel zone
The star-like phylogeny for the cristata, senegallensis and
somaliensis lineages of G. cristata (Fig. 2) suggests once
again that they result from a single vicariance event that
may have occurred around 390 KYA (Table 1). As we discussed above, G. cristata seems to originate from subSaharan Africa. Accordingly, the divergence between senegallensis and cristata should correspond to E-W vicariance
in the Sahel zone (Fig. 1a), even if we cannot exclude the
alternative that one or more lineage only secondarily
invaded sub-Saharan Africa.

Interestingly, other E-W vicariance events were also evidenced in the Sahel zone at similar dates in unrelated species such as the hartebeest (Alcelaphus busephalus, ~0.39
MYA [7]), and the roan antelope (Hippotragus equinus,
0.53–1.02 MYA [28]). It has been suggested that such east-

Page 14 of 22

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:32

ern and western lineages could have been isolated in refuges north and east (resp. north and west) of an
expanding central African rainforest belt, during some
periods of climate warming [7]. Alternatively, we suggest
that refuge populations might instead have been isolated
by the lake Chad during such humid phases that led to
lake "Mega-Chad" episodes [72].
E-W vicariance in the Maghreb
G. theklae sensu stricto is structured in two distinct genetic
groups (theklae and superflua) for which the current repartition and divergence date obtained from MDIV analysis
suggest a separation in two distinct Maghreban refuges
during the penultimate Pleistocene glacial event around
150 KYA (Table 1; for other examples of E-W vicariance in
the Maghreb see [73,74]). Since a recent expansion is
strongly supported in theklae (star-like phylogeny of haplotypes (Fig. 3b), and significantly negative Fu's Fs) we
find likely that genetic exchanges detected by MDIV took
place after the widespread western haplogroup theklae
underwent an eastwards range expansion ~30 KYA (as
indicated by mismatch distribution analysis), thus creating a zone of contact in E Tunisia (see Fig. 1b). However,
we cannot totally exclude the possibility that the presence
of one theklae haplotype in Tunisia (Table 5) reflects
incomplete lineage sorting instead of gene flow.
The Rift valley
The eastern branch of the Kenyan Rift valley might induce
some restrictions to gene flow between sub-Saharan populations of G. cristata in the eastern Sahel (cristata) and
Kenya (somaliensis). In addition, our limited data on the
former subspecies of G. theklae in Ethiopia are indicative
of a long-term genetic isolation between populations that
live on highland steppes on either side of the Rift valley
(praetermissa-hueii split ~1.1 MYA). Hence, these results
agree with the observation that the Rift valley constitutes
a major zoogeographical barrier in mammals [75] and
birds [76], but also seems to impact the population genetics of species currently distributed on either side (wildebeest Connochaetes taurinus [29]; ostrich Struthio camelus
[43]; Ethiopian wolf Canis simensis [75]; African wild dog
Lycaon pictus [77]).
Systematics and endemism in Africa
The present study considerably challenges current taxonomic hypotheses in these two species complexes, and
paves the way for future revisions.

First, G. malabarica, an Indian endemic taxon, turned out
to be closely related to crested lark, and not to Thekla lark
as previously believed. Hence, apparent disjunction in the
distribution of the Thekla lark "superspecies", which comprised three sets of populations separated by Arabo-Saharan deserts (see introduction), proved here to be an

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/32

artefact of incorrect taxonomy [78]. Interestingly however,
the hypothesis of a fragmentation by Arabo-Saharan
deserts of a widely distributed ancestral species was actually supported for the crested lark instead (see above).
Secondly, we found a previously unsuspected deep break
between Thekla lark populations north and south of the
Sahara that occurred ~2.8 MYA. These two sets of populations lack diagnostic morphological (see Fig. 4) as well as
plumage color characteristics, which prevented them from
being split by previous authors. However, as we have
shown that phenotypic convergence is overwhelming in
these taxa, it is now clear that phenotypes are not appropriate taxonomic clues. As these two sets of populations
are currently separated by a very wide gap of Sahara (Fig.
1b), we believe they should now be recognized as distinct
allopatric species.
In addition, the Horn of Africa seems to harbour several
narrow-ranged endemic taxa: praetermissa appears to be
endemic to the high plateaus of Ethiopia north of the Rift
valley, hueii replaces it in similar habitats south of the Rift
valley, while ellioti is restricted to arid landscapes in Somalia (Fig. 1b). These allopatric taxa might warrant recognition at the species level, but this conclusion is postponed
here because of limited sample size for ellioti and hueii,
and because this study did not include representatives of
three other subspecies described from the Horn of Africa
(mallablensis, huriensis and harrarensis).
The recognition of new narrow-ranged endemic taxa in
the Horn of Africa might significantly supplement the current list of 23 avian species endemic to Ethiopia or Somalia [79]. Interestingly, the only other savanna-dwelling
avian species investigated to date, the ostrich, also
revealed one previously unexpected endemic species in
the Horn of Africa [43], suggesting that more cryptic species remain to be identified in this part of the world. This
seems to be quite a general phenomenon in sub-Saharan
Africa, where phylogeographical patterns are still poorly
understood. Indeed, wherever they are undertaken,
molecular phylogenetic studies tend to reveal a more
complex biogeographic history than previously recognized, and lead to the recognition of new species (Eastern
Arc Mountains [80]; Congo Basin forests [81]; SW Africa
[82]). Such findings may have fundamental evolutionary
implications for the understanding of large-scale speciation processes, but also for conservation strategies [83]
(but see [84]).

Conclusion
In this study, phylogenetic, population genetics and phenotypic data were integrated in a comparative framework
to reconstruct the evolutionary history of two widespread
sibling species complexes. In agreement with the climate-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:32

driven speciation hypothesis, both past and current climatic factors were found to be influential in driving speciation patterns, as shown respectively by recurrent
vicariance mediated by the Sahara, and multiple instances
of convergence in morphology (body size) and plumage
color.

Methods
Specimens
We obtained partial cytochrome b (cyt b) sequences for
154 specimens and complete morphological measurements for 204 specimens (previous morphological and
genetic data obtained from earlier studies in Morocco [42]
and the Mediterranean region in G. cristata [44] were
pooled to new material obtained specifically for this
study; as a result, we included in our analyses some previously published cyt b sequences: AY165151, AY769740–
AY769752, DQ028951– DQ028957). Traditional subspecific classification was used as an indication of plumage
variation. Moroccan specimens were mainly collected
under license for the present project [42]. Most of the
additional specimens consist of museum skins preserved
at the French Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle in
Paris, while a few were sent to us directly by contributors
and three American museums (see acknowledgements
and Additional file 3 for information including voucher/
specimen number). Museum vouchers offer a unique
opportunity to cover large geographic areas, including
currently inaccessible ones (e.g. Somalia). In compensation, however, separate amplification of short DNA fragments had to be devised, which did not preclude from
fairly large failures rate depending on whether formaldehyde was used to treat stuffed specimens.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/32

ondly, DNA was extracted from toe pad by using the CTAB
procedure [87]. The 291 bp fragment of the cyt b was then
amplified using primers cyt-H' and F. The amplifications
were performed in a final volume of 50 μl. Cycling conditions were 92°C for 40 s, 52°C for 40 s and 72°C for 60 s
for 45 cycles. To increase the resolution of weakly supported nodes, we also sequenced longer mtDNA fragments for a subset of specimens of each genetic group
identified using the 291 bp alignment. For fresh specimens, this was done by sequencing with both primers A
and F. For museum specimens, the cyt b was divided into
three contiguous and overlapping fragments: A'C, BD and
H'F [44]. After purification (QiaQuick PCR Purification
Kit, Qiagena (Holden, Germany)), direct sequencing with
the same primers was performed on an automated
sequencer following the supplier's procedures (Beckmann
Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA, USA).
We are confident that cytochrome b sequences obtained
were of mitochondrial origin because: (i) there was no
stop codon or insertion/deletion in the reading frame, (ii)
a stop codon was found at the end of the cyt b gene at the
expected position, (iii) no double band was detected on
the gels, (iv) the base composition and pattern of base
and amino acid substitution were typical of the avian
mitochondrial genome (not shown; for additional tests,
see [44]).

Mitochondrial DNA data
Extraction and sequencing
DNA extraction and sequencing was performed as follows. For fresh tissue samples, the protocol described in
Guillaumet et al. [42] was applied (protocol I). Total DNA
was isolated using the Sigma GenElute mammalian
genomic DNA kit, and a cyt b fragment of 1100 bp was
amplified using the primers A (chicken position L-14995)
and F (H-16065) [85]. Reactions were performed in 50 μl
volumes using 1× buffer, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM of
dNTPs, 20 pmol of each primer, and 1 unit of Taq DNA
polymerase (Promega), at an annealing temperature of
52°C. A 291 bp fragment was then sequenced using
primer F as sequencing primer. Amplification products
were read with a Pharmacia LKB A.L.F automatic DNA
sequencer following recommended procedures.

Nuclear data
Since mtDNA trees may differ from species trees (e.g.
because of stochastic lineage sorting [88]), we attempted
to sequence a nuclear gene in representatives of all genetic
groups identified with the cyt b (because a large part of
museum specimens were fixed with formaldehyde, we
had to face a strong failure rate). Two primers designed
specifically for this study: bfib1 (5'-TAAAACTATGTATTCTGTTAGTGACAG-3') and bfib2 (5'-TAAACAATTCCTTTATTCATGAATATG-3') allowed us to amplify and
sequence 300 bp of the intron 7 of the β-fibrinogen gene
(β-fibint 7) in 32 specimens representing all species/taxa
covered by mtDNA analyses, with the exception of hueii
and malabarica. The primers were chosen to amplify the
region with highest estimated mutation rate (as measured
by substitution rate for G. theklae-G. cristata comparisons
in Morocco). Another primer bfib3 (5'-CTTACTGTCCTCAGCACTG-3') was designed and substitute to bfib2 to
sequence the most variable 115 bp of the same fragment
in four additional specimens of G. malabarica. The
sequences have been deposited in GenBank (see Tables 2,
3 for Accession Nos).

A specific procedure was applied for museum specimens
(protocol II [44] adapted from [86]). First, to avoid contaminations, manipulations were performed in a lab
where no fresh samples had previously been handled. Sec-

Mitochondrial DNA phylogeny
Phylogenetic relationships between haplotypes were
inferred using Neighbor-Joining (NJ), Maximum Parsimony (MP), and Maximum Likelihood (ML) methods

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:32

using Phylowin [89]. One sequence of Galerida magnirostris (GenBank AY165169) and Spizocorys sclateri
(AY165170) were used as outgroups. Pairwise genetic distances were calculated with Kimura two parameter model
[90], as preliminary analyses using HKY+Gamma, the best
substitution model as identified by ModelGenerator [91]
yielded identical results. For ML, a transition over transversion ratio of 3.4 (corresponding to the estimated value
for the genus Galerida) was applied. The ML tree building
algorithm in Phylowin is that of the FASTDNAML program [92]. We also performed Bayesian analyses using
MrBayes [93]. However, we obtained identical results with
this method and thus only present the results obtained
with Phylowin.
We first performed NJ, MP and ML for the short (291 bp)
fragment which we obtained for 143 specimens (out of
154), resulting in a total of 20 haplotypes. Bootstrap tests
[94] with 5000 replicates for NJ (500 for MP, 100 for ML)
were performed to assess the robustness of the clades (i.e.
bootstrap support: BS). Since the long fragment could not
be obtained in all museum specimens, we had to work
with haplotypes of heterogeneous length (31 were
detected overall, see Additional file 1a). As a result, the
topology (shown in Fig. 2) was obtained with NJ using the
pairwise gap removal option (average length = 665 bp).
For ML and MP, bootstrap support for a given node was
instead obtained using a judiciously chosen subset of haplotypes of the same length (see Additional file 1b).
Because the results obtained with the short fragment were
nearly identical to those obtained using the longest available alignment, we only present the latter here (Fig. 2),
but the results obtained with the short fragment can be
seen in the Additional file 1. A combined analysis including β-fibrinogen data did not reveal further resolution for
any node and is thus not presented here.
Finally, because assumptions of phylogenetic methods are
often violated with intraspecific data sets [95], major
groups and alternative potential evolutionary paths
among haplotypes were identified for the short fragment
using two median-joining networks (the crested and
Thekla lark complexes were treated separately) with the
parameter ε set to 1 [96].
Divergence times
Divergence times were estimated using a Bayesian MCMC
(Markov Chain Monte Carlo) method as implemented in
the program BEAST [97] that simultaneously estimates
phylogeny and allows relaxed molecular clocks. Relative
rate tests [98] performed with MEGA 3 [99] revealed that
a clock-like mode of sequence evolution could not be
rejected (all P > 0.09), except for the hueii sequence as
compared to G. praetermissa (P < 0.05). As a result, we
used a constant rate of sequence evolution throughout the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/32

tree (CLOC procedure), except for the divergence between
hueii and praetermissa for which uncorrelated rates among
branches were allowed (UCLN procedure). Because of
heterogeneous length of sequences, different subsets of
sequences were used to estimate the age of all nodes (see
additional file 1b). For the longest available alignment
(1011 bp), the rate of the clock was fixed at 0.01 average
substitution per site per million years (according to the
standard calibration of 2% sequence divergence per MY in
birds [11,16,100]). For shorter alignments, this rate was
adjusted to account for slight variations along the
sequence (this resulted in rates varying from 0.0085 to
0.0121). The analyses relied on 2.000.000 steps following
a discarded burn-in of 100.000 steps. Convergence of the
chain to the stationary distribution was confirmed using
the application Tracer 1.2 [97]. For each node, we
obtained an estimate of the divergence time (mean posterior of their age in years) and the 95% HPD interval for
the divergence time estimates (highest posterior density,
hereafter confidence interval).
Since BEAST does not correct for intra-specific polymorphism (i.e. it estimates the age of the most recent common ancestor of the genes, not of the populations they are
sampled from), divergence times between pairs of recently
diverged and/or highly polymorphic taxa were instead
estimated using a coalescent-based method (MDIV [101])
that also accounts for recurrent gene flow in the estimation of the divergence time. Several independent runs
were performed to ensure that we obtained a good convergence of the chains (we applied a burn-in time of 500.000
steps with 4.500.000 additional steps to estimate the posterior distribution) and to assess the influence of priors on
parameter estimates (Tmax and Mmaxwere allowed to vary
from 1 to 10). Divergence within G. cristata was estimated
as the divergence between the senegallensis and cristata lineages (see results section and Fig. 2), while divergence
within G. theklae was estimated as the divergence between
the populations in France and Morocco (theklae lineage)
and populations in Tunisia (superflua). Note that upper
bounds for credibility intervals around estimated values
are not given (this is indicated by a question mark) since
they critically depended on an assumed prior for Tmax (as
a result of a smooth decrease of proba(T|data) after the
mode of T; see Additional file 4c,d).
Population genetics
The following analyses are based on mtDNA sequences.
Test of population subdivision
As regards the two species with large geographic repartition (G. theklae and G. cristata sensu stricto), we examined
geographic differentiation using the short alignment (291
bp). Populations were grouped according to phylogeny
(after Fig. 2) and geography, resulting in two groups for

Page 17 of 22
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:32

each species (see Additional file 3 for detailed repartition
of specimens). In G. theklae, theklae grouped populations
from France and Morocco, while superflua only consisted
of Tunisian samples. In G. cristata, cristata consisted of
four populations (Morocco, Europe, Middle East and Far
East), and senegallensis of two populations (Sahel and eastern Maghreb; note that Sahel here only encompasses western Sahel, east to W Chad – see Fig. 1a). Genetic
differentiation among populations was tested using an FST
approach, based on either haplotypic frequencies (conventional approach) or Kimura two parameter genetic distance (ΦST approach), using the program Arlequin 2.0
[102]. Since both methods yielded identical results, we
only present the latter. The null distribution of pairwise
ΦST values is obtained by randomly permuting haplotypes
between populations (analyses presented here are based
on 1000 permutations). The P-value of the test is the proportion of permutations leading to a ΦST value larger or
equal to the observed one.
Test of demographic stability
Demographic stability (or selective neutrality) was tested
for populations and phylogenetic groupings of populations in G. theklae and G. cristata (see above) using Fu's Fs
statistic [103]. When Fs was significantly negative (as
tested by the permutation procedure implemented in
Arlequin 2.0 [102]), we further tested whether observed
data fitted a sudden expansion model using a test of goodness of fit (based on SSD statistic) derived from the mismatch-distribution analysis [104] as implemented in
Arlequin 2.0. In addition, we calculated the time elapsed
since the putative expansion event t using the parameter τ
inferred from the mismatch distribution, using the formula t = τ/2 μ, where μ is the mutation rate per gene
(taken to be 2%/MY times the length of sequences used).
Test of recurrent gene flow across the Sahara
To test if the Sahara acts as a current barrier to gene flow
in the senegallensis group of the crested lark, we simultaneously estimated the divergence time and the amount of
recurrent gene flow using MDIV [101] (see above for
details).
Phenotypic evolution
Morphometry
Adult specimens were measured by a single author (AG)
for six morphological variables using a caliper (to the
nearest 0.1 mm) or a ruler. Measured variables were bill
length (bl), bill depth (bd), bill width (bw), tarsus length
(tar), tail length (tl) and wing length (wl; see Additional
file 3 for details).

The morphological similarity among populations or species was examined by constructing a morphological tree.
Only populations with sample size ≥ 2 were considered.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/32

To increase sample sizes, both sexes were treated together
(similar results were obtained when only males were kept;
not shown). The morphological tree was based on Mahalanobis squared distances (which account for the correlation between variables). The resulting matrix was then
used to reconstruct a tree using the Neighbor-Joining algorithm. To assess whether morphology accurately reflects
history, its topology was then compared to the phylogeny
derived from mitochondrial data, using a ShimodairaHasegawa test as implemented in R [105]. To make the
molecular and morphological trees directly comparable,
each morphological group was ascribed a single mtDNA
sequence. Because of very low within-group polymorphism, sequence choice is not expected to alter the results,
a contention that was checked by performing two distinct
trials: 1) we retained the most frequent haplotype in the
group considered; 2) one sequence was taken at random.
Both approaches yielded identical results.
Since the two trees were incongruent, the possible influences of the climate and interspecific competition on
morphology were tested as follows. First, we summarized
morphological variation using a principal component
analysis (PCA). The first axis of the PCA (hereafter PC1)
explained 67% of total variance and all six variables were
strongly and positively correlated with it (all r > 0.63),
demonstrating that it is essentially a size axis. The second
axis of the PCA (PC2) explained 13% of total variance and
was a shape axis, distinguishing species or populations
with a proportionately wide bill and short tarsus
(r(PC2,bw) = 0.70; but r(PC2,tar) = -0.42).
Then, basic climatic data were obtained from the GHCN
(Global Historical Climatology Network) database [106].
Emberger's aridity Index Q was computed as a summary
climatic statistic: Q = 2000⋅ P [107], where P is the mean
M2 − m2
annual precipitations in mm, m is the mean temperature
of the coldest month (used as a proxy of the mean minimum temperature of the coldest month) and M is the
mean temperature of the hottest month (used as a proxy
of the mean maximum temperature of the hottest month),
temperatures being in K. As Q increases non-linearly in
more mesic habitat, ln(Q) was used instead [108]. Finally,
we created the variable aridity = -ln(Q) so that more arid
stations get higher values of the aridity index. Specimens
sampled between two stations of the network were
ascribed an intermediate value.
To account for interspecific competition, a binary variable
called comp was created. For each specimen, comp equals 1
when it lives sympatrically with a representative of the
other species complex, 0 otherwise. Three simple variables
as well as all their interactions were thus used as candidate
Page 18 of 22

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:32

factors: species complex (variable sc, either Thekla or
crested), competition and aridity. To avoid pseudo-replication, average value of each factor and both PC1 and PC2
(dependent variables) were taken for each of the seventeen groups defined for building the morphological tree
(Fig. 4), and a stepwise forward multiple regression analysis using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was performed to identify relevant factors involved in
morphological variation (the model with lowest AIC was
retained as the best model).

Because species and populations within each species complex cannot be regarded as independent data points, we
also performed a comparative analysis using Generalized
Estimating Equations (GEE), which allows multiple factors to be tested simultaneously while controlling for phylogenetic effects [109]. Because only five phylogenetic
degrees of freedom were available, we limited the testing
procedure to two effects: (i) competition; and (ii) the role
of aridity was tested through its interaction with competition, as suggested by the results of ordinary regression (see
results section).

All statistical analyses were performed using STATISTICA
version 5 (© StatSoft, Inc), and R version 2.0.1 (© The R
Foundation for Statistical Computing).
Color variation
To test the hypothesis of independent adaptation to desertic environment in both G. cristata and G. theklae, short cyt
b sequences (291 bp) could be obtained for the following
sandy desert subspecies: helenae (n = 1; Tassili, Algeria)
and isabellina (n = 3; Ennedi, Chad) for G. cristata, carolinae (n = 3; Figuig, Morocco) and deichleri (n = 3; S Tunisia)
for G. theklae (see Fig. 1 and Additional file 2). We consider that the hypothesis is supported if each subspecies
belong to a distinct monophyletic genetic group which
also includes typical dark subspecies. If reciprocal monophyly cannot be ascertained, the hypothesis will still be
regarded as supported if genetic groups diverged well
before intra-group radiations leading to sandy and dark
subspecies, and if no gene flow (as estimated by MDIV)
has occurred between the groups since their divergence.
