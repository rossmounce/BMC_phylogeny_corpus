Abstract
Background: Mistic is a unique Bacillus subtilis protein with virtually no detectable homologues in
GenBank, which appears to integrate into the bacterial membrane despite an overall hydrophilic
composition. These unusual properties have been shown to be useful for high-yield recombinant
expression of other membrane proteins through fusion to the C-terminus of Mistic. To better
understand the structure and function of Mistic, we systematically searched for and characterized
homologous proteins among closely related bacteria.
Results: Three homologues of Mistic were found with 62% to 93% residue identity, all only 84
residues in length, corresponding to the C-terminal residues of B. subtilis Mistic. In every case, the
Mistic gene was found partially overlapping a downstream gene for a K+ channel protein. Residue
variation amongst these sequences is restricted to loop regions of the protein's structure,
suggesting that secondary structure elements and overall fold have been conserved. Additionally,
all three homologues retain the functional ability to chaperone fusion partners to the membrane.
Conclusion: The functional core of Mistic consists of 84 moderately conserved residues that are
sufficient for membrane targeting and integration. Understanding the minimal structural and
chemical complexity of Mistic will lead to insights into the mechanistic underpinnings of Misticchaperoned membrane integration, as well as how to optimize its use for the recombinant
heterologous expression of other integral membrane proteins of interest.

Background
Integral membrane (IM) proteins constitute nearly a third
of the proteins of sequenced genomes and play critical
roles in intercellular signaling, homeostasis and metabolite transport. Additionally, they are the target of a majority of therapeutic pharmaceuticals. However, our
understanding of this class of proteins has lagged that of
soluble proteins due to inherent difficulties in their
recombinant production and their structural analysis. A
new method to overcome the first obstacle recently
emerged with the discovery of Mistic, a unique

hydrophilic protein from Bacillus subtilis that associates
with the bacterial membrane, and when fused to the Nterminus of other IM proteins can chaperone their expression in E. coli at high yields [1]. It has been proposed that
Mistic is able to autonomously integrate, in a Sec-independent manner, into the lipid bilayer. This is based on
the indirect evidence that the protein lacks a stretch of
hydrophobic amino acids that could be interpreted,
mechanistically, as a signal sequence by the bacteria's
translocon machinery. Additionally, high level expression
of Mistic and Mistic fusions can be achieved without the

toxicity normally observed with recombinant expression
of IM proteins at levels saturating the secretory system.
More recently it was shown that Mistic fused to GFP partitioned to liposomes in a cell-free expression system lacking a translocon system [2]. Nevertheless, the physical
mechanism by which Mistic accomplishes its chaperoning
function remains unclear, and it is almost imperative to
hypothesize that the highly hydrophilic surface of the
NMR structure of Mistic must undergo a substantial,
dynamic, conformational transition in order to associate
with the membrane.
To obtain better understanding of protein structure-function relationships, one can examine residue conservation
patterns among homologous family members in a class of
proteins. These patterns have been used to identify residues critical for protein structure and folding [3], demonstrate ligand and substrate specificity [4], determine active
site catalytic residues [5], identify protein-protein interaction interfaces [6], and uncover allosteric modulation
pathways through a protein domain [7,8]. The application of this approach to Mistic, however, has been hampered by the complete absence, until very recently with
the addition of B. licheniformis, of any proteins with
detectable homology to Mistic using conventional Blast
algorithms against the public genome database (GenBank), despite the presence of the genomes of B. anthracis,
B. cereus, B. thuringiensis, B. halodurans, and B. clausii (Figure 1a). To overcome this limitation, we systematically
probed Bacillus species closely related to B. subtilis to
determine the natural distribution of this gene and to find
homologous proteins for comparative analysis. Our
results reveal a protein core for Mistic, consisting of the Cterminal 84 residues, that is conserved amongst the evolutionarily-nearest neighbors of B. subtilis and is sufficient to
chaperone recombinant IM proteins to the lipid bilayer.

Results and discussion
Mistic gene structure
Genomic DNA from four species of Bacillus closely
related to B. subtilis was amplified using two 'MisticSeeker'
oligonucleotides complementary to conserved regions of
the upstream gene, YugP, and the downstream gene,
YugO-b (Figure 1b). For B. licheniformis, B. mojavensis and
B. atrophaeus, amplified PCR fragments produced nucleotide sequence data of 900–950 base pairs, similar to that
expected based on the positioning of the MisticSeeker
primers with respect to the B. subtilis genome. In contrast,
the primers only produced a 651 base pair fragment from
B. pumilus genomic DNA. Alignment of the base
sequences reveals general conservation of this region of
the Bacillus chromosome, with higher degrees of conservation within the predicted open-reading-frames of the
flanking genes, as expected. Of the variations observed,
most notable is that B. pumilus has a large deletion (~250

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/6/10

bps) in the region encoding Mistic in B. subtilis (Figure
1c). Also, while there are no gaps or insertions in the 252
base pairs that encode for the C-terminal 84 residues of
Mistic in B. subtilis, there are ample such frame shifting
mutations in the region that aligns with the coding region
for the first 26 residues of the original Mistic. Our data for
B. licheniformis are consistent with that recently published
for its sequenced genome [9,10].
Mistic homologues have only 84 residues
Conceptual translation of the DNA sequences from B.
licheniformis, B. mojavensis and B. atrophaeus revealed 252
base pair open-reading-frames that translated to proteins
homologous to the C-terminal 84 amino acids of the original B. subtilis Mistic protein (Figure 2a). In all three cases,
the Mistic homologue is located just upstream and partially overlapping (by four base pairs, including the stop
codon for Mistic) the K+ channel gene (YugO-b). For B.
pumilus, no open-reading frame was found in the
sequence determined for the amplified region between
YugP and YugO-b. The percent identity residue conservation for these homologues varied from 93% to 62% for
the 84 amino acid core region of the protein and correlated with the evolutionary distance between species.
Interestingly, B. subtilis Mistic possesses an internal
methionine at its 27th residue, equivalent to the first residue in all of the homologous proteins, as well as a reasonable upstream ribosome binding site, suggestive of an
alternative internal translation initation for this protein
that might also produce an 84-residue variant of Mistic.
The resulting truncated variant of Mistic from B. subtilis is
remarkably less chemically diverse due to loss of its only
cysteine and tryptophan residues as well as three of its
four phenylalanines. Surprisingly, it is also more
hydrophilic and acidic with fully one quarter of its residues either aspartate or glutamate.
Mistic homologues conserve structurally intrinsic and
acidic residues
The degree of conservation of a residue (determined as
described in Methods) was mapped to the NMR structure
of Mistic (PDB id: 1YGM). Unconserved residues are generally restricted to loop regions or the C-terminus of Mistic leaving a subset of highly conserved residues forming
the core of the Mistic structure (Figure 2b). This pattern is
consistent with the retention of secondary structural elements, as well as the overall protein fold, amongst the
homologues. The first forty residues of Mistic are significantly more conserved (30 of 40 strictly conserved) than
the C-terminal half (15 of 44). This aspect of the conservation pattern is even more striking in the comparison of
the two interhelical loops: L2-3 has 9 of 13 residues
strictly conserved, whereas L3-4 only retains a single glycine out of seven residues. Perhaps not coincidentally, the
N-terminal 40 residues also contain the two most promi-

Bacillus species probed in this study (starred) or those with fully sequenced genomes. Those with the YugP (metalloprotease)
and YugO-b (K+ channel) genes sequentially arranged in their chromosome are indicated in blue. Those with Mistic homologues are highlighted (grey). (b) Genetic structure of the region in B. subtilis analyzed by this study, with the sequenced region

YugP and YugO-b genes from five Bacillus species (A = green, C = teal, G = blue, T = lime) highlighting deletions and insertions
(white). Translation initiation codons are marked with arrows, colored as in (b). B. pumilus has approximately 250 fewer bases
between the two primary genes, consistent with the lack (or loss) of an 84 residue protein preceding the K+ channel openreading-frame. The genomic region of B. subtilis that encodes the first 26 amino acids of its Mistic homologue (between the grey
and black arrows), aligns with numerous frame-shifting mutations and stop codons (not shown) in even the most closely
related species (B. mojavensis) suggestive that the internal methionine (residue 27) may also serve as an in vivo translation initiation start site for Mistic.

nently distinct structural elements of Mistic, namely a substantial kink located at the centre of the longest helix (α2)
and a partially re-entrant loop (L2-3) that buries several
consecutive residues in the core of the helical bundle.
These elements may play critical roles in modulating Mistic's conformational changes. Buried residues are conserved to a greater degree than accessible residues (27 of
41 vs. 18 of 43) again supporting the notion that the interhelical interactions that stabilize the folded bundle are
retained within the family of Mistic proteins. Most
intriguing however, is the nearly strict conservation of the
distribution of acidic residues (aspartate, glutamate) over

the surface of Mistic's structure. Discounting the three
highly flexible C-terminal residues, there are only five
cases (out of 19) where a negatively charged residue is not
strictly conserved in sequence space. In each of these
instances, a compensating mutation can be found structurally proximate to the site of the alteration (Figure 2).
Four of these pairs move the negative charge to an adjacent residue, one or two turns along the face of a helix, or
to an adjacent alternate loop, respectively, while retaining
a single negative charge. In the fifth case, the compensating loss of an adjacent cationic lysine residue maintains
locally a similar overall net surface charge distribution.

Sequence and structure of Mistic homologues
Sequence and structure of Mistic homologues. (a) Sequence alignment of the four 84-residue Mistic homologues is
shown, as well as the leading 26 amino acids found only in B. subtilis Mistic. Residues are colored by their degree of conservation, as indicated. Below the alignment, secondary structural elements are depicted as well as residue accessibility. Pairs of
compensating mutations related to conservation of acidic residues are indicated by purple brackets. (b) Unconserved residues
(numbered 1–9) and weakly conserved residues (a-e) are mapped to the NMR structure of Mistic (colored as above) revealing
their restriction to flexible, loop regions of the protein. The core of the structure (grey oval) is virtually devoid of significant
alterations. This pattern suggests that the overall structural fold of the protein, less the N-terminal helix (α1, grey), is conserved between the four homologues. Positions of compensating mutational pairs for anionic residues are indicated by purple
arrows revealing their close proximity in the folded protein.
These observations suggest that the highly anionic nature
of Mistic may be central to its mechanism of targeting and
associating with the lipid bilayer.
Mistic homologues retain chaperone function
We tested the ability of the Mistic homologues, as well as
the shorter form of Mistic from B. subtilis, to chaperone
the expression of other IM proteins when fused to Mistic's

C-terminus. Utilizing as test cases two topologically distinct cargo proteins, Alk3 (a TGF-β receptor) and CRFR2β
(a GPCR), the Mistic-tagged fusion proteins were
expressed and purified in parallel and yields compared.
All four homologues produced roughly equivalent, high
yields of both proteins based on SDS-PAGE analysis (Figure 3a–b). Surprisingly, the observed yields were similar
to those obtained with the 110 amino acid variation of

Mistic, indicating that the first 26 residues of Mistic are
not essential to its membrane targeting function. Further,
we tested the ability of these proteins to produce the
GPCR CCR5, which in previous studies had yielded very
low quantities of protein. With a more optimal linker
between the Mistic domain and CCR5, all of these fusions
could produce CCR5 in the membrane at approximately 1
mg/liter shaker culture (Figure 3c).

Conclusion
Mistic is a protein that assists the integration into the lipid
bilayer of covalently-linked, recombinantly expressed IM
proteins, but the mechanisms underlying this ability are
unknown. We have shown here that the functional core of
Mistic consists of the C-terminal 84 residues. This core
conserves to a substantial degree residues critical to the
formation of helical secondary structural elements as well
as residues important for interhelical interactions. Even
more strictly conserved is the surface distribution of an
abundance of acidic residues. While this characteristic
may seem incompatible with membrane association, in
many respects it chemically and structurally resembles
amphiphilic, anionic fusogenic peptides like the synthetic
20-amino acid peptide with 5 glutamates derived from the
amino-terminal segment of hemagglutinin of influenza
virus [11,12]. Analogous functional mechanisms may
also exist here, as both proteins play roles in membrane
targeting of downstream proteins.
The existence of functional, truncated Mistic homologues
raises the question as to what role the first helix (α1) of
the four-helical bundle structure plays in Mistic's membrane association mechanism or its membrane topology.
One plausible explanation is that the hydrophobic core of
the Mistic bundle, which is exposed with removal of the
N-terminal helix (α1), is in fact the hydrophobic surface
that forms the interface for association with the lipid

bilayer. This model is consistent with the previous observation that mutation of a core methionine within this
putative hydrophobic surface to a more hydrophilic residue reduces Mistic's membrane affinity and chaperone
efficacy [1]. In this case, Mistic's association peripherally,
with the outer leaflet of the inner membrane, would force
any trailing fusion protein linked to the C-terminus of
Mistic to interact with and partition between the membrane and periplasmic space, thus facilitating its integration. This mode of association is consistent with the
recent analysis of the structural nature of proteins at the
membrane-water interface that concludes that the presence of charged, amphiphilic helices positioned interfacially, roughly parallel with the membrane surface, is not
irregular [13].
Mistic's in vivo function is equally perplexing. We have
demonstrated that the distribution of this gene is
restricted to a very limited number of closely related soil
Bacilli and is always linked to the bacterium's K+ channel
gene as overlapping reading frames. However, these
observations have not yet produced a testable hypothesis
as to Mistic's natural function. So far, the simple gene
knockout produces no obvious phenotype (unpublished
data). Nonetheless, the sequence conservation pattern
observed within the family of Mistic proteins provides an
additional clue towards elucidating the molecular mechanism of Mistic-facilitated membrane association, uncovering its natural function, and potentially optimizing its
sequence for the recombinant heterologous expression of
other IM proteins of interest.

Methods
Cloning of Mistic homologues
Genomic DNA was obtained from the Bacillus Genetic
Stock Center (BGSC) for B. licheniformis, BGSCID 5A36; B.
mojavensis, BGSCID 28A1; B. atrophaeus, BGSCID 11A1; B.

MisticSeekerOligo3':ATGGCTAGTTATTGCTCAGCGGCC
GACTGWNGANACNGTNABNABNGCCCACCADATNCC) PCR was conducted for 30 cycles with one minute
incubations between melting (94°C), annealing (50°C),
and elongation (72°C), temperatures using Vent DNA
polymerase. The amplified product was sequenced using
the same MisticSeeker oligos. Both DNA sequences and
conceptually translated protein sequences were analyzed
and aligned using ClustalW [14]. Residues were categorized as either having a single, fully conserved residue,
being strongly conserved (STA; NEQK; NHQK; NDEQ;
QHRK; MILV; MILF; HY; FYW), weakly conserved (CSA;
ATV; SAG; STNK; STPA; SGND; SNDEQK; NDEQHK;
NEQHRK; FVLIM; HFY), or unconserved, consistent with
the positively scoring groups that occur in the Gonnet
Pam250 matrix. Secondary structural boundaries and residue accessibility were calculated and drawn using PROCHECK [15].
Expression of fusion proteins with Mistic homologues
Mistic was cloned by PCR into Gateway® destination (Invitrogen) vectors for expression studies on eukaryotic IM
proteins. Eukaryotic target genes in Gateway® donor vectors were recombined with destination vectors to create
expression vectors with the cargo protein fused downstream of Mistic with a separation linker of 19 amino
acids. Freshly transformed colonies were cultured in TB
and induced with 0.1 mM isopropyl-β-Dthiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at an O.D. of 1.0. Growth was continued
overnight at 10–18°C. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 300 mM KCl, 10% glycerol,
10 mM imidazole with 1 mg/ml lysozyme. Cells were disrupted by sonication on ice and membranes were pelleted
by high speed centrifugation (100,000 × g). Membranes
were solubilized by sonication in the above buffer with
the addition of 20 mM LDAO. Insoluble material was
removed by high speed centrifugation and the desired
protein was purified from the resulting supernatant using
Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (Qiagen). Purified protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, before and after overnight incubation with thrombin at 4°C.
