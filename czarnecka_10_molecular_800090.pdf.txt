'mitochondriopathy'?
Review

Abstract
Mitochondria are sub-cellular organelles that produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through oxidative
phosphorylation (OXPHOS). As suggested over 70 years ago by Otto Warburg and recently confirmed with molecular
techniques, alterations in respiratory activity and in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) appear to be common features of
malignant cells. Somatic mtDNA mutations have been reported in many types of cancer cells, and some reports
document the prevalence of inherited mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms in cancer patients. Nevertheless, a careful
reanalysis of methodological criteria and methodology applied in those reports has shown that numerous papers can't
be used as relevant sources of data for systematic review, meta-analysis, or finally for establishment of clinically
applicable markers.
In this review technical and conceptual errors commonly occurring in the literature are summarized. In the first place
we discuss, why many of the published papers cannot be used as a valid and clinically useful sources of evidence in the
biomedical and healthcare contexts. The reasons for introduction of noise in data and in consequence - bias for the
interpretation of the role of mitochondrial DNA in the complex process of tumorigenesis are listed. In the second part
of the text practical aspects of mtDNA research and requirements necessary to fulfill in order to use mtDNA analysis in
clinics are shown. Stringent methodological criteria of a case-controlled experiment in molecular medicine are
indicated. In the third part we suggest, what lessons can be learned for the future and propose guidelines for mtDNA
analysis in oncology. Finally we conclude that, although several conceptual and methodological difficulties hinder the
research on mitochondrial patho-physiology in cancer cells, this area of molecular medicine should be considered of
high importance for future clinical practice.
The role of mitochondria in carcinogenesis
What is the relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction and carcinogenesis? For many decades mitochondria
have been presented only as 'powerhouse' organelles. The
primary function of mitochondria, which is ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS),
remained mostly in the focus of interest of biochemists.
Nowadays we are becoming more aware of the fact, that
these dynamic structures play a pivotal role in cell transformation. Indeed, genetic and metabolic alterations in
mitochondria have been shown to be the cause or contributing factors of pathogenesis in a broad range of
human diseases, including cancer [1-4]. As already recognized many years ago by Otto Warburg, cancer cells generate excessive lactate in aerobic glycolysis and OXPHOS

disruption appears to be a general feature of malignant
cells [3,5]. Recent evidence indicates the importance of
hypoxia and the progressive elevation in mitochondrial
ROS production which over time leads to stabilization of
cells via increased HIF-2alpha expression, enabling cells
to survive with sustained levels of elevated ROS [6,7].
Recent evidence also indicates that the resulting mutated
cancer-causing proteomic feedback amplifiesy cell transformation process by directly affecting mitochondrial
function in combinatorial ways and promoting a vicious
spiral of malignant cell transformation [8]. Evidence
exists that onco-proteins and tumor suppressor proteins
physically localize in? to the mitochondria in cancer cells
where they directly regulate malignant mitochondrial
programs, including apoptosis [7,9]. At the same time the
presence of mtDNA mutations in cancer cells have been
claimed in a deluge of reports. MtDNA mutations were
found in solid tumors, as well as lymphomas and leukaemias [9-13]. Several groups have found associations

between somatic mtDNA mutations and cancer development, progression or metastasis [1-3,12,14]. In addition,
recent studies have correlated inherited polymorphisms
of the mitochondrial genome with the risk for cancer
development, including prostate, and oral and colorectal
cancer [15,16]. Altogether mitochondrial research offer
great promise for the future and seem to offer prominent
cancer markers.
We understand that gradually it will be more commonly accepted that mitochondrial medicine is providing
better insight into who should receive cancer therapy and
what therapy should be administered, ultimately avoiding
suboptimal treatment [17-19].
At the same time although many papers have been published in the field of 'mitochondrial oncology', clinicians
and patients still cannot fully benefit from the development of molecular mitochondrial research [20-22]. In this
article we propose that there are three common problems
in the mitochondrial oncology research and that these
need to be addressed in any future research. The majority
of published work does not offer above all 1) statistically
significant data obtained from experiments with clear
methodology; 2) cause-effect explanations (as correlation does not imply causation); 3) patho-physiological
insight (i.e. what are the functional consequences of specific mtDNA mutations for the cell), and 3) mechanisms
based explanations. All those deficiencies result in publication of large number of papers which can't be used for
cancer diagnostics or prognosis. Above all molecular
mechanisms behind mitochondrial carcinogenesis are
still uncovered [5,7,22].

Multiple errors in mtDNA research
Last five years have brought into light that significant
number of medical mtDNA studies are based on obviously flawed sequencing results and report phantom
mutation [22,23]. A critical revision of the findings
reported in previous studies indicated a lack of proper
methodological standards that led to an over-interpretation of the role of the mtDNA in cancer development and
progression. It was shown that more than half of published mtDNA sequencing studies contain obvious
errors, no matter in which journal the investigation is
published [22-28]. Oncogenetic contexts of mtDNA
mutation cancer reports resulted in conclusion of false
association between seemingly causal variants and tumor
instability [22,29]. It was the worldwide mtDNA phylogeny analysis that revealed that contamination and sample
mix-up episodes were erroneously interpreted as mtDNA
instabilities in multiple types of tumors and/or reported
as germline mutations, while those were actually mtDNA
polymorphisms [22,25]. It is therefore obligatory to
remember that tumor sample is apparently distinguished
from the corresponding normal tissue sample by somatic

Page 2 of 7

mutations, while mtDNA variation between different
cases, between patients populations or patient sequence
and rCRS must be defined as inherited polymorphism
[30,31].
In the light of reports from Bandelt et al. one need to
remember that although a mitochondrial paradigm of
metabolic and degenerative diseases, aging, and cancer
was proposed [5], the study of somatic DNA instabilities
still constitutes a debatable topic. Different causes can
lead to DNA alteration patterns reported between different cells or tissues from the same individual. Patterns of
instabilities can arise from technical errors at any stage of
the analysis, including DNA extraction, amplification,
and sequencing, mutation screening and documentation
handling. In particular inadvertent DNA contamination
and sample mixing yield mosaic variation that was erroneously interpreted as mutations [23,27,32,33]. The
authors claim that the sequencing efforts in the field of
cancer were challenged by technical problems, caused
also by DNA sequencing biochemical problems, incomplete sequencing, and misdocumentation. Moreover
insufficient reference to previously published reports
resulted in interpretive problems [34]. Moreober novelty
of a given mtDNA variant was most often equated with
nonregistration in MITOMAP database - as in the case of
multiple mutations of MT-ND3 gene and m.15287T > C
[20], which is obvious overestimation since MITOMAP is
simply incomplete database in comparison to PubMed.
As proven by Bandelt and Salas phylogenetic analysis of
whole mitochondrial genomes mutations provides
method for elimination of artificial mutations in studies
and helps to verify the accuracy of mtDNA analysis
[22,23,33].
Finally one need to remember that wrong conclusions
concerning the pathogenic status of specific mtDNA
mutations may also be influenced by errors in logistics of
laboratory work, data handling, and accidental amplification of nuclear mitochondrial pseudogenes (NUMTs) and
analysis of their sequences since NUMTs are a potential
source of contamination during mitochondrial DNA PCR
amplification [35]. Mitochondrial genome disease-associated biomarkers - polymorphisms or mutations - must be
rigorously authenticated to preclude any affiliation with
paralogous nuclear pseudogenes and requires careful
primer design and testing. Direct pseudogene contribution in the analysis is not always obvious and can confound suggested mtDNA biomarkers. Potential markers
must be thoroughly investigated to exclude false mtDNA
mutations in the interpretation sequencing data. BLAST
searches of nuclear pseudogenes eliminate the possibility
of integration of these nuclear sequences in mtDNA analysis, since many primers may amplify homologous
NUMTs embedded anywhere in the nuclear genome. If
the use of mitochondrial DNA analysis, and in particular,

Czarnecka et al. Journal of Biomedical Science 2010, 17:31
http://www.jbiomedsci.com/content/17/1/31

somatic mitochondrial genome mutations is of important
utility and medical merit, data requires critical follow-up
from a pseudogene perspective. For example, mitochondrial PCR protocols may be simultaneously run on
nucleic acid recovered from ρ0 cells to identify and
exclude co-amplification of NUMTs [36]
With respect to this problem, we underline the fact that
while the pattern of mtDNA mutations in cancer tissues
may provide markers of potential clinical validity (see Figure 1), numerous published experiments do not fulfill
methodological criteria of a case-control molecular-medical experiment and are often more case reports and case
studies [22]. At this time many of mtDNA mutation cancer correlation reports need to be verified with larger
sample sizes, as shown by J.A. Califano group [37]. Under
these circumstances it is still unclear, how many of the
mtDNA mutations reported in cancer cells have been
adequately determined [22].

The challenge of mitochondrial research
To answer the question of mitochondrial role in cancer
development, one needs to take into consideration that
mutations in mtDNA may result in structural alterations
of mitochondrial proteins and disrupted OXPHOS,
which in turn would shift the metabolism towards anaerobic respiration - a common feature of cancer cells [3840]. At the same time, the combination of different
defects of the respiratory chain might have substantial
physiological effects on the level of production of the carcinogenic reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive
nitrogen species (RNS) [2,41-43]. Thereupon the distur-

experiments design.

bance of mitochondrial respiration enhances cell oxidative stress and possibly propels carcinogenic vicious circle
[10,14,44]. First of all, molecular research should confirm
the biological and physiological significance of mutations,
as in the case of reports by Ishikawa et al. [2] and Arnold
et al. [45], who have clearly shown the mtDNA sequence
influence cell proliferation and cancer metastasis [42,45].
Biochemical approach should be followed by subsequent
critical clinical analyses of patient data [46], as in the
reports from Zhou et al. [47] and Petros et al. [1].
At the moment is more and more clear that not all
mitochondrial mutations reported are actual causative
factors in cancer development and/or progression, but
may also arise as a consequence of cell transformation
[48,49]. This paradox leads to a basic chicken-and-egg
problem: what is the first cause in cancer development
and what is a mere consequence of cell transformation? It
seems even more complicated, as often in the case of
polymorphisms and mutations the literature contains
multiple conflicting reports, regarding which polymorphic base is actually associated with cancer, as it is the
case of A10398G [12,50]. This inconsistency makes verification of the mtDNA mutation-cancer correlation more
and even more complicated [12,51,52].
To answer the question of mtDNA mutations and polymorphisms involvement in tumor development, detailed
biochemical and biophysical analyses of mutation consequences are needed [4,38]. In particular, given the critical
role of mitochondria in apoptosis, it is possible that
mutations in mtDNA in cancer cells could significantly
affect the cellular apoptotic response to anticancer agents
and promote multi-drug resistance [14,53-55]. It was
proven that frame-shift muatation of NADH dehydrogenase (respiratory complex I) through ROS mediated
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt/protein kinase C/histone deacetylase pathway may inhibit apoptosis [43,54],
including resistance to apoptosis induced by staurosporine, 5-fluorouracil, and cisplatin in vitro [56]. On the
second hand recent findings regarding the role of some
mitochondria-localized proteins (including p53, AAA+
proteases, or mitochondrial heat shock proteins) in the
cell cycle and apoptosis further support the mitochondria
- mediated apoptosis resistance hypothesis [9,57-59]. In
this case a global analysis of the localization and level of
mitochondrial transcripts and proteins might help to
determine specific mito-markers [5,8,60]. As mentioned
before, empirically observed co-variation is a necessary
but not sufficient condition for establishing causal links
between mtDNA changes and tumorigenesis. Thus, multidisciplinary effort is needed to confirm the significance of mitochondrial failure in cancer evolution [18]. It
is because mitochondrial failure has been reported at all
levels of their structure and function, including abnormal
ultrastructure and deregulation of metabolism [1,9], but

Czarnecka et al. Journal of Biomedical Science 2010, 17:31

signaling pathways leading from mtDNA mutation via
mitochondrial transcriptome, proteome to metabolome
and to nuclear response and cancer development have
not yet been defined [61-63]. It has only been shown that
mtDNA mutations observed in tumors result in abnormal expression of mtDNA genes. Now there are still
missing links between respiratory deficiency, structural
impairment of mtDNA-encoded proteins and specific
mtDNA mutations in specific types of tumors. Currently
there is very little integration between the research in cell
physiology (mitochondrial failure) and in body physiology (tumor development) [11,60]. A holistic understanding of mitochondrial function with a special emphasis on
genomic, proteomic, and functional information in mitochondria requires collaborative efforts from multiple disciplines. In particular, efforts coupling computational
biology with genomic and proteomic sciences are essential to advance the field. We also need to build new models and experimental tools for assessing mitochondrial
biology and to interface with animal models of disease in
a reasonably high throughput manner [64]. Holistic models are essential to advance understanding of mitochondrial function in the genomic and proteomic perspective.
We also see a need to bridge molecular biology with clinical sciences by developing in vivo measurements of mitochondrial function. While animal models and in silico
models remain indispensable, quantitative markers cannot be created without quantitative measurements of
mitochondrial function in humans [65,66]. This requires
novel experimental tools and collaboration between basic
scientists, clinicians and engineers. Finally, the data
obtained in computational, molecular, biochemical and
epidemiologic approaches should form the basis for constructing a model of mitochondrial function that will provide insight into all levels of organization and assist in
developing mitochondrial medicine. Therefore we believe
that greater emphasis should be put on functional
research, since the identification of mtDNA mutations in
oncology is likely to have a significant impact on clinical
and prognostic procedure [3,5,21].

mtDNA research guidelines
In the light of presented re-analysis of previous experiments a detailed design of new trials is necessary [22].
Nevertheless we believe that global analysis of mtDNA
mutation pattern in cancer cells should result in the proposal of 'mito-markers' specific for particular sub-types of
cancer [3,11,21]. MtDNA mutation patterns could provide prognostic and/or predictive information about
tumors, including the qualification of residual risk of distant recurrence in patients with negative lymph nodes. By
virtue of the mtDNA clonal nature and high copy number, the detection of mtDNA mutations may provide a

Page 4 of 7

powerful molecular tool for tumor detection with advantages over nuclear genome-based methods, as body fluids
or non-invasive tissue access are available for mitochondrial DNA recovery [67]. For that reasons, once a specific,
clear and testable hypothesis is stated, every particular
correlation study or experiment should recruit additional
control groups consisting of either healthy volunteers
and/or a second cohort of patients. Moreover, known
classical diagnostic and prognostic markers must be considered along with new molecular markers to elucidate
independent prognostic factors. Furthermore, sufficient
numbers of participants must be enrolled to perform formal power calculations. Only when these additional conditions are fulfilled, the molecular hypothesis and
biochemical result may be transferred to clinical settings
and translated into patient benefits [9,21,68-70].
At the same time if cell biology and molecular phenotype of a particular mutation are known [71,72], strictly
controlled experiments on normal and cancer tissue from
the same patient, as well as analyses of different cancer
tissues acquired from patients with cancer at stage may
help to verify the role of this mutation in cancer biology.
The significance of mutations and polymorphism in cancer development should also be addressed in controlled
populations composed of patients with other TNM and
cancer indispensable to confirm medical importance of
basic science phenomena (see Figure 2). It is only recently
when first prospective cohort study on mtDNA copy
number and cancer risk was published [73]. Therefore we
would like to stress that only precisely design studies may
workout clinically relevant data and resolve the causality
dilemma of mtDNA mutations and cell transformation.
Finally, we need to emphasize the role of multidisciplinary approach and close collaboration between basic
and clinical scientists in designing and conducting studies
aimed at developing and evaluating novel cancer diagnostic methods or therapies [5,9,37]. Only crosstalk of many
specialists may help to ensure that fundamental research
feeds into clinical practice in ways that benefit patients.
Lastly, we would also like to suggest that in order to be
able to develop new clinical strategies, it is essential to
establish new interdisciplinary training programs in cancer biology. Among other areas, the curriculum of such a
program should provide strong background in molecular
genetics, experimental methodology as well as human
physiology and pathology. Trainees (pre-doctoral and
postdoctoral students) should be exposed to a broad
range of cancer-related research encompassing both basic
and clinical aspects of the disease. Such programs are
currently being developed, for example in the Roswell
Park Cancer Institute, while funding bodies have recognized a need to support joint basic and clinical training
programs.

Conclusions
It is hard to neglect the importance of mitochondria in
cancer biology. Polymorphisms (and mutations) of
mtDNA, even driven by random processes during malignant transformation, present an excellent possibility for
early tumor detection by analyzing the bodily fluids from
patients with tumors [74,75]. New molecular mitochondrial markers might be of pivotal importance as histopathologic subtypes of cancer are associated with distinct
clinical manifestations, but their diagnosis is often difficult because some tumor subtypes have overlapping
microscopic characteristics. Therefore, ancillary methods
are needed to optimize classification and we believe that
distinct mitochondrial gene mutation-polymorphism
profiles might serve as adequate pathologic markers [76].
In selected cancers the development of mito-marker(s)
could provide additional or alternative diagnostic and
prognostic tools for oncologists and pathologists. The
analysis based on mito-markers could significantly
enhance the specificity of cancer detection and prediction of tumor behavior, as well as of patient outcome (see
Figure 2) [77]. When established, mitochondrial-markers
could help in selecting genetically predisposed subjects,
setting early diagnosis [5,11], predicting prognosis, managing follow-up [67] and choosing the best therapeutic

approaches [5,53]. Mitochondrial polymorphisms may be
candidates for cancer biomarkers, and deserve further
investigation, perhaps through the use of experimental
models including cybrids and analysis of large cohorts of
patients. However, when conducting research it is necessary to develop standard experimental and data analysis
procedures in order to validate those biomarkers so that
they can be reliably used in several laboratories for cancer
prognosis in asymptomatic patients, facilitating diagnosis
once symptoms appear, or monitoring individuals known
to be at high risk [3,5,14,21]. Quantitative mitochondrial
biomarkers may aid histopathological analysis of tumor
biopsies for the diagnosis, classification and characterization of the differentiation state of a tumor. There is now a
widespread consensus that other prognostic factors, different to those included in the TNM-stages system, are
required to improve the accuracy in the management of
cancer patients, therefore the development of mitochondrial oncology is to benefit clinical practice. Also carriers
of some germ-line mtDNA polymorphism could be more
susceptible to cancer development and therefore selected
as candidate population for intensive prevention and
early detection programs [2,4,12,46]. Lastly mitochondria
are also emerging as targets for anti-cancer drugs. Many
mitocans selectively interfere with the bioenergetic functions of cancer cell mitochondria, causing major disruptions often associated with ensuing overloads in ROS
production leading to the induction of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway [78].
