Background

Results

The Central Asian region is surrounded on all sides by different HIV-1 subtypes: A in Russia, C in Pakistan and India
and a B/C recombinant in China. There are approximately
500,000 IDUs in the Central Asian Region. Between 1995
and 2005, 4696 HIV/AIDS cases were officially reported
in Kazakhstan. The most significant route of transmission
is IDU, constituting of about 84% of the total cases, following by heterosexual (12%) and bi/homosexual transmission (0.5%) (UNAIDS).

Phylogenetic trees were constructed for both the ProRT
fragments and the nearly full-length genomes sequenced.
Based on the Neighbor-joining analysis of the 85 ProRT
amplified samples 80 (94.1%) were subtype A, 4 (4.7%)
were CRF02_AG, and 1 (1.2%) was subtype C. In addition, the phylogenetic analysis of the ProRT region
revealed that most A subtypes clustered with those circulating in countries of the former Soviet Union (FSU). The
CRF02_AG strains clustered with similar strains identified
in Uzbekistan as well as the most common CRF02 reference strain. The single C strain clustered with world reference subtype C strains. Furthermore, all 6 nearly fulllength sequences obtained were subtype A and showed
that the Uzbekistan A is not genetically distinct from reference sequences used from Ukraine, The Republic of
Georgia, or Uzbekistan.

Methods
To determine the HIV-1 genetic diversity in Kazakhstan,
85 confirmed HIV seropositives samples were collected
from 2001–2003. Most of the 85 strains were isolated
from individuals in three sites; Uko, Ust Kamenogorsk,
and Almaty. Ninety percent of those enrolled were intravenous drug users (IDUs). A region of 1.2 kb in length
that included all of the protease (Pro) and the amino terminus of the reverse transcriptase (RT) protein was
sequenced of all 85 samples collected. From these, 6 samples were randomly selected for nearly full genome
sequencing. Both amplified product was sequenced using
an ABI 3100 automated sequencer. Phylogenetic analysis
was performed by first aligning the sequences obtained
with reference sequences using the program MacGDE followed by a Neighbor-joining analysis performed with
MEGA.

Conclusion
The HIV epidemic in Kazakhstan is predominantly in the
IDUs population. A factor that contributes to this occurrence is that Kazakhstan is located on the main route of
drug trafficking. Based on both ProRT and the nearly fulllength sequence analysis both the subtype A and the
CRF02 strains circulating in Kazakhstan are part of the
same epidemic that is threatening the rest of the FSU. The
single subtype C found in the study was from a Kazakhstan citizen, seropositive since 1995, who had never
traveled out of country but stated that the infection was
contracted sexually from a foreigner from Iran. Continued

molecular epidemiological and virological monitoring of
HIV-1 worldwide remains of great importance, since there
is always the potential for other subtypes to be introduced
into the Central Asian region.
