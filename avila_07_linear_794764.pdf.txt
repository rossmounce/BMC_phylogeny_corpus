Abstract
Background: The pyridine nucleotide disulfide reductase (PNDR) is a large and heterogeneous
protein family divided into two classes (I and II), which reflect the divergent evolution of its
characteristic disulfide redox active site. However, not all the PNDR members fit into these
categories and this suggests the need of further studies to achieve a more comprehensive
classification of this complex family.
Results: A workflow to improve the clusterization of protein families based on the array of linear
conserved motifs is designed. The method is applied to the PNDR large family finding two main
groups, which correspond to PNDR classes I and II. However, two other separate protein clusters,
previously classified as class I in most databases, are outgrouped: the peroxide reductases (NAOX,
NAPE) and the type II NADH dehydrogenases (NDH-2). In this way, two novel PNDR classes III
and IV for NAOX/NAPE and NDH-2 respectively are proposed. By knowledge-driven biochemical
and functional data analyses done on the new class IV, a linear array of motifs putatively related to
Cu(II)-reductase activity is detected in a specific subset of NDH-2.
Conclusion: The results presented are a novel contribution to the classification of the complex
and large PNDR protein family, supporting its reclusterization into four classes. The linear array of
motifs detected within the class IV PNDR subfamily could be useful as a signature for a particular
subgroup of NDH-2.

Background
Sequence information and protein function
One of the main aims of computational biology is to infer
protein function using sequence information. Clustering
of proteins in families sharing functional characteristics
and derived from a common ancestor is a key purpose of
sequence comparative analyses. However, algorithms

used to explore sequence similarity and to retrieve homologous proteins, such as BLAST [1] or FASTA [2], are not
sensitive enough to find out evolutionary divergent members of large protein families, while PSI-BLAST [3]
increases the sensitivity on detriment of specificity. In this
scenario, an efficient strategy to detect more divergent
sequences within protein families is the use of sequence

motifs. These are highly conserved regions across a subset
of proteins sharing the same function. In general, they
play an important role in protein functions and folds [4].
Furthermore, several motifs may be arranged into fingerprints which improve the detection of remote homologous proteins reducing the "noise" that accompanies the
local alignment algorithms.
Databases of motifs and domains
The most widely used biological databases that explore
and classify proteins according to their composition in
patterns, motifs or domains are: PROSITE [5]; Pfam [6];
BLOCKS [7]; PRINTS [8] and InterPro [9]. InterPro is at
present the database that includes the widest and most
comprehensive classification of proteins families since it
integrates the information about domains and motifs
from most of the other databases [9]. While all of the
resources share a common interest in protein family classification using sequence similarity as a key factor to
achieve their purposes, the focus of each database is different. In fact, the specific methods underpinning each of
them are optimal for different purposes. Some databases
use all-encompassing domain/profile-based approaches
and they are good to detect members of divergent superfamilies (i.e., Pfam). Others use motif-based approaches
which correspond to functional sites, being appropriated
to detect members of more specific subfamilies (i.e.,
PROSITE and PRINTS). Several of these databases also
include structural information useful for the identification of globular protein domains. In general, the protein
families proposed are quite large, having many members
with rather different biochemical functions and activities.
Therefore, it is important to try new ways to achieve an
improved functional assignment within the protein families.
The PNDR protein family
The pyridine nucleotide disulfide reductases (PNDR) is a
large and heterogeneous protein family with a characteristic disulfide redox-active site together with the NAD(P)H
and FAD binding sites [10]. In InterPro the PNDR
includes around 10,000 proteins divided in two main
subfamilies: class I (IPR001100) with 6,701 sequences
and class II (IPR000103) with 2,809 sequences. These two
large classes are further divided in other subfamilies that
incorporate subsets of proteins with some specific motifs
or domains. For each subset, a different InterPro accession
number is given. More restrictive motifs in order to place
a protein in the PNDR family are the "active site class I"
and "active site class II", bearing InterPro IDs: IPR012999
(1,608 sequences) and IPR008255 (701 sequences),
respectively.

Since most proteins have multiple domains and motifs
and InterPro give a particular assignment for each of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/96

them, the highly conserved modules (domains or motifs)
impose strong bias in the protein classifications. In the
case of the PNDR superfamily, all of the proteins include
one NAD+ binding motif and two FAD binding motifs.
These highly conserved motifs bring together a large
amount of nucleotide oxidoreductases that many times
have quite different functional activities. In contrast to all
the InterPro PNDR class I and class II hits, only a very
small subset of proteins are included in PROSITE and in
PRINTS. The PROSITE's active site pattern defined as
PNDR class I (PS00076) includes 124 proteins and class II
(PS00573) 73 proteins. The PRINTS' signature defined as
PNDR class I (PR00411) includes a true set of 102
sequences and class II (PR00469) 41 sequences.
Type II NADH dehydrogenase (NDH-2) is a member of
the PNDR family that catalyzes the electron transfer from
NAD(P)H to quinones without energy-transduction. A
large number of organisms, ranging from archaea to
eukaryotes, present NDH-2 besides the canonical rotenone-sensitive type I NADH dehydrogenase [11]. The
NDH-2 enzyme could be considered a redundant protein,
but it acquires other roles in certain organisms in some
conditions. For example, in Escherichia coli, NDH-2 has
Cu(II)-reductase activity [12] rendering the cells more stable in front of high or very low copper concentrations in
the culture media [13]; in Azotobacter vinelandii, it protects
the nitrogenase complex against O2 inhibition [14]; in
Methylococcus capsulatus, it mediates the electron transfer
to the membrane-bound methane monooxygenase [15].
This plasticity could be associated with the presence of
some specific functional motifs.
Linear array of motifs to classify the PNDR protein family
Considering that only a small proportion of the proteins
clusterized as PNDR class I and PNDR class II in InterPro
have a PROSITE's PNDR active site signature, a revision of
this superfamily classes was performed. To achieve this,
we applied a workflow to the whole PNDR family that
resulted in the identification of two new outgroups: class
III and class IV. The specific linear array of motifs provides
a good fingerprint to describe each class. Furthermore,
one of these fingerprints aided to the analysis of PNDR
class IV leading to the discovery of a new linear motif that
could explain the observed Cu(II)-reductase activity in a
subset of the NDH-2 proteins.

Results and Discussion
Identification of four classes within the PNDR family
In order to achieve a comprehensive classification of the
PNDR family the following workflow was designed and
performed:

1.- All the sequences annotated as PNDR in UniProt/
SwissProt database were extracted and grouped into

Page 2 of 8

BMC Bioinformatics 2007, 8:96

eleven initial protein groups or clusters based on their biochemical function: AHPF, bacterial alkyl hydroperoxide
reductases; DHNA, NADH dehydrogenases or alkyl
hydroperoxide reductases; DLDH, lipoamide dehydrogenase; GSHR, glutathione reductase; MERA, mercuric
reductase; NAOX, NADH oxidase; NAPE, NADH peroxidase; NDH-2, NADH dehyrogenase-2; TRXB, prokaryotes,
archaea and lower eukaryotes thioredoxin reductases;
TRXR, higher eukaryotes thioredoxin reductases; TYTR,
trypanothione reductase.
2.- For each one of the eleven groups a multiple sequence
alignment (MSA) was built and a HMM profile was
derived [16]. The number of proteins included in each
MSA was: 5 AHPF, 41 DLDH, 25 GSHR, 13 MERA, 36
TRXB, 8 TRXR, 5 TYTR. UniProt/SwisProt has not enough
DHNA, NAOX, NAPE or NDH-2 sequences to construct a
HMM profile. In order to obtain at least 5 candidates for
these groups, manual retrieval of the most referenced
sequences in UniProt/TrEMBL was performed.
3.- To enrich the MSA of the eleven groups, new sequences
were extracted from UniProt/TrEMBL database using a
two-way search method: (i) the database was scanned
with the eleven HMM profiles; (ii) the newly found
sequences were then compared with all the groups using
a second round of BLAST and they were assigned to a
given group according to the lowest BLAST E-value found.
The number of proteins of each final cluster after filtering
out the redundancy was: 43 AHPF, 21 DHNA, 97 DLDH,
71 GSHR, 60 MERA, 61 NAOX, 11 NAPE, 56 NDH-2, 99
TRXB, 69 TRXR, 20 TYTR.
4.- Each cluster was submitted to MEME [17] for the detection of conserved blocks. All MEME parameters were set as
default except for the maximum number of motifs which
was established in 10, based on the number of motifs
present in the PNDRDTASE I (PR00411) and the PNDRDTASE II (PR00469) fingerprints from PRINTS database.
5.- The groups were then globally analyzed by comparison of all the conserved blocks using LAMA tool [18].
Sequences with most of their blocks in common were
regrouped together and sent back to step 4 up to reach stable groups.
The application of the above workflow resulted in 24 different conserved blocks allocated along the initial eleven
protein clusters (Figure 1). All clusters share the NAD,
FAD1 and FAD2 binding motifs. The workflow detected
two large groups: the first one includes DLDH, GSHR,
MERA, TRXR, and TYTR and the other one AHPF, DHNA,
and TRXB. The fingerprints obtained for these groups were
similar to the previous PRINTS annotation PR00411 and
PR00469 for class I and II PNDR, respectively. This fact

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/96

provides a good validation for the methodology. Additionally, two novel clusters were segregated: peroxide
reductases (NAPE and NAOX) and NADH dehyrogenases2 (NDH-2). These groups include some distinctive blocks
and thus they could be classified separately as classes III
and IV, respectively. The fingerprints obtained for each of
the four final classes were compiled in BLOCKS format [7]
and included in the Additional file 1, 2, 3 and 4.
Phylogenetic analysis of the PNDR sequences
In order to cross-validate the proposed classification, phylogenetic sequence analysis of the PNDR protein family
was performed using random selected sequences from
each of the eleven protein groups. The distance matrices
derived from the MSAs were analyzed using two different
methods: neighbor-joining (corresponding to unrooted
tree in Figure 2) and parsimony (not shown). The
sequences were always segregated into four main
branches, matching the classification derived from the fingerprint analysis. It is important to note that, at present,
UniProt uses DHNA nomenclature to designate two types
of enzymes: the alkyl hydroperoxide reductases from B.
subtilis and Bacillus sp. (DHNA) and the NADH dehydrogenases-2 from E. coli and H. influenzae (NDH-2). In Figure 2 these enzymes segregate separately as expected,
despite the fact that they have the same name in UniProt.
PNDR classes III and IV
The NADH peroxidases (new PNDR class III) are structural homologues of GSHR but they do not contain a Cx(2,4)-C redox active motif [19]. Studies on NAPE from
Enterococcus faecalis demonstrated that a modified single
Cys residue (Cys-sulfenic acid, Cys42-SOH) plays the catalytic redox role. In the same way, NAOX from E. faecalis
has mechanistic and structural similarities [20].

The type II NADH dehydrogenases (new PNDR class IV)
correspond to a group of proteins widely spread in nature.
Only some of them have a C-x-x-C motif, but there is little
information about its biochemical function. In NDH-2
from E. coli the C-x-x-C motif seems to be involved in copper binding and it has been related to the Cu(II)-reductase
activity of this enzyme [21].
The fingerprint based PNDR clusterization proposed
above is in agreement with the classical classification criteria, which assume that these enzymes were originated by
divergent evolution from an ancestral FAD/NAD(P)H oxidase and they had acquired their disulfide reductase activities independently. The segregation of the PNDR family
in four classes with clear differences in their disulfide
redox active sites is in support of an independent evolutionary trail.

Specific linear motifs detected in NDH-2 PNDR class IV
Considering that the Cu(II)-reductase function proven in
E. coli may be extended to NDH-2 from other organisms,
a specific search to detect all the putative Cu(II)-reductases within this PNDR subfamily was performed. To
achieve this, the NDH-2 subfamily was subjected to a
workflow detailed as follow. First, the NDH-2s homologues were extracted from the non-redundant protein
database (nrdb) using MAST [22] with the novel array of
motifs developed for NDH-2 PNDR class IV (Figure 1 and
additional file 4) obtaining about 500 sequences. Second,
the sequences lacking the C-x-x-C motif from this dataset
were discarded, recovering 120 sequences. Third, the
redundancy was filtered out and a final group of 78
sequences was obtained. This final group of selected pro-

teins was then analyzed by three independent motif discovery methods: MSA manual supervised inspection,
MEME and PRATT automatic algorithms assessment
[17,23]. The consensus regions obtained by the three
methods were selected. The well-known G-x-G-x-x-G
nucleotide (NAD+, FAD) binding motifs were clearly
found but they were not considered. Excluding those
blocks, the most conserved region found was around the
C-x-x-C motif. The MSA of such conserved region is
shown in a LOGO representation [24] in Figure 3A. The
LOGO shows the residue conservation pattern for the
selected region in 78 sequences, which is divided in two
parts (from position 1 to 16 and from 29 to 40) and
includes several putative functional motifs. Within the
first part, the region between positions 1 to 12 matchs the

flavin binding motif described by Eggink et al. [25]. The
conserved C-x-x-C, located consecutive to the Eggink's
motif, is a putative Cu(I)-binding motif [21]. The second
conserved part, from position 29 to 40, includes an invariant VPP motif, which could be good candidate for a
Cu(II)-binding motif considering experimental evidences
from a muscle protein [26]. In addition, Cu(I) and Cu(II)
putative binding motifs are separated by a loop of nonconserved residues. This kind of arrangement for copper
binding has been experimentally detected in CopC, a periplasmic enzyme from Pseudomonas syringae [27]. Quinones also play a crucial role in NDH-2 enzymatic activity
[11] and therefore, the presence of a quinone binding
motif is expected. In the defined conserved region, positions 33 to 40 resemble a quinone-binding motif similar
to the one proposed by Fisher et al. in bacterial photosyn-

thetic reaction center [28]. In summary, the close association of the FAD, and the putative Cu(I), Cu(II) and
quinone binding motifs provide an adequate arrangement for an efficient electron transfer from NADH to copper via FAD and/or quinone. The four described motifs
are assembled into a signature (Figure 3B) that describes a
subset of proteins from class IV PNDR related to copper
metabolism.
Using this signature as a search motif, many other NDH2s from bacteria that resist high copper concentrations
were retrieved: Pseudomonas putida (57% ID against E. coli
NDH-2), Pseudomonas syringae (54% ID), Ralstonia sp.
(48% ID), Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (97%
ID),Erwinia amylovora (80% ID), Cupriavidus necator (50%
ID) [29-33]. Since the pair-wise identity (ID) in the full

sequences alignment ranges from 99 % to 22 %, the conserved region found is considered statistically significant
and therefore it can be related to a specific function within
the NDH-2 subfamily. High conservation of this region
reflects a relatively high selection pressure through the
evolution. Further experimental studies will be needed in
order to test the proposed functional assignment predicted for the NDH-2 proteins.

Conclusion
The wide use of protein sequence analysis together with
the exponential growth of protein databases justify the
demand of new approaches to protein comparison and
functional classification. The presented strategy proves to
be efficient to perform protein clusterization based on the
assignment of fingerprints (i.e. linear array of conserved
motifs and domains), since it allows to recognize divergent members within large protein families. The proposed
method is applied to the complex and large PNDR protein
family improving its classification and detecting two nondescribed outgroups. Moreover, a specific array of motifs
detected in a subset of proteins within class IV PNDR subfamily is proposed as a new signature for NDH-2 proteins
that may have copper binding-redox activity.

Methods
In order to automate data processing, standard bioinformatics tools in addition to a few home-built PERL scripts
were used.
Construction and matching up of PNDR family fingerprints
Initial protein clusters were built using keyword search in
UniProt/SwissProt database. MSA were generated using
ClustalX [34] with default parameterization. HMM profiles [16] were created with HMMER package [35]. Initial
clusters were further enriched implementing a reciprocal
best-match approach (i.e. extracting sequences from UniProt/TrEMBL based on a HMM profile search and performing the reverse BLAST [1] search of each sequence
against all clusters). Conserved blocks among each cluster
were detected by MEME [17] setting the maximum
number of blocks to 10 and all other parameters as
default. Block to block comparison was performed using
LAMA [18]. Clusters having more than 8 blocks in common were fused together.
Phylogenetic studies
Unrooted tree for the PNDR family was generated with
four randomly selected sequences from each of the initial

clusters, i.e. AHPF, DHNA, DLDH, GSHR, MERA, NAOX,
NAPE, NDH-2, TRXB, TRXR, TYTR. The neighbor-joining
analysis was performed from a MSA with default parameterization and with 1000 bootstrap trials using ClustalX
[34]. The results were visualized with TreeView [36]. The
maximum parsimony method was carried out using
PHYLIP package [37].
Designing functional protein signature related to copper
metabolism in NDH-2
NCBI's non-redundant database (nrdb) was scanned for
NDH-2s using MAST [22] fed with the PNDR class IV fingerprint with a 10-25 E-value cut-off. Only sequences bearing a C-x-x-C motif were kept and redundancy was further
removed based on a 90 % sequence identity criteria.
Motifs were extracted using PRATT [23] and MEME [17]
automatic algorithms, and further reinforced by manual
inspection of the MSA. Pattern based searches were performed using ScanProsite standalone tool [38]. The
LOGO representation of sequence conservation was created by WebLogo [39].
