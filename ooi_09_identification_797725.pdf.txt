Abstract
Background: Human enterovirus 71 (HEV71) can cause Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) with neurological
complications, which may rapidly progress to fulminant cardiorespiratory failure, and death. Early recognition of children
at risk is the key to reduce acute mortality and morbidity.
Methods: We examined data collected through a prospective clinical study of HFMD conducted between 2000 and 2006
that included 3 distinct outbreaks of HEV71 to identify risk factors associated with neurological involvement in children
with HFMD.
Results: Total duration of fever ≥ 3 days, peak temperature ≥ 38.5°C and history of lethargy were identified as
independent risk factors for neurological involvement (evident by CSF pleocytosis) in the analysis of 725 children
admitted during the first phase of the study. When they were validated in the second phase of the study, two or more
(≥ 2) risk factors were present in 162 (65%) of 250 children with CSF pleocytosis compared with 56 (30%) of 186 children
with no CSF pleocytosis (OR 4.27, 95% CI2.79–6.56, p < 0.0001). The usefulness of the three risk factors in identifying
children with CSF pleocytosis on hospital admission during the second phase of the study was also tested. Peak
temperature ≥ 38.5°C and history of lethargy had the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative
predictive value (NPV) of 28%(48/174), 89%(125/140), 76%(48/63) and 50%(125/251), respectively in predicting CSF
pleocytosis in children that were seen within the first 2 days of febrile illness. For those presented on the 3rd or later day
of febrile illness, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of ≥ 2 risk factors predictive of CSF pleocytosis were 75%(57/
76), 59%(27/46), 75%(57/76) and 59%(27/46), respectively.
Conclusion: Three readily elicited clinical risk factors were identified to help detect children at risk of neurological
involvement. These risk factors may serve as a guide to clinicians to decide the need for hospitalization and further
investigation, including cerebrospinal fluid examination, and close monitoring for disease progression in children with
HFMD.

Background
Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common
childhood exanthema caused by species A human enteroviruses (HEVA), particularly Coxsackievirus A16
(CVA16)[1]. In most instances, this is a mild self-limiting
illness. The affected children are often given out-patient
care with symptomatic treatment. However over the last
decade HFMD has emerged as a growing public health
problem in Asia following frequent outbreaks of deathassociated HFMD caused by a more virulence member of
HEVA, human enterovirus 71 (HEV71), in a number of
countries in the region [2-5]. This was first recognized
with large outbreaks of HFMD associated with neurological disease and alarming fatalities in Sarawak, Malaysia in
1997 and in Taiwan in 1998 [2,3]. Fatal cases typically
presented with a brief duration of febrile illness, subtle
neurological signs and died dramatically of acute refractory cardiac dysfunction and fulminant pulmonary
oedema within hours of developing signs of tachycardia,
poor peripheral perfusion and tachypnea. Indeed, most of
them died shortly after hospital admission, and some
even before or on arrival at hospital [2,6-8]. Although
severe neurological complications and death only occur
in a small minority of children with HFMD, the fulminant
disease course of the fatal cases has caused great public
alarm in Asia. Experience from recent outbreaks of HEV71
associated HFMD (HEV71-HFMD) in Asia showed that
primary care doctors are often overwhelmed with large
number of children with HFMD seeking medical attention for the fear of neurological complications and death.
Because of the risk of sudden death, coupled with tremendous parental pressure to admit children with HFMD into
hospital for observation, children with HFMD are often
routinely admitted into hospital for observation in
Sarawak, which has imposed a huge burden on the healthcare system. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis has so
far been the universal finding in fatal cases even though
many have no obvious neurological signs prior to sudden
onset of cardiorespiratory failure and death [2,6,8]. In the
absence of clear neurological sign, CSF pleocytosis (indicative of neurological involvement) has thus been considered an objective marker of complicated disease, allowing
clinicians to focus their attention and provide timely
intervention in these patients before they develop fatal
cardiorespiratory failure. We therefore examined data collected through a prospective study of HFMD to identify
and validate risk factors associated with neurological
involvement in children with HFMD that may be used by
clinicians managing children with HFMD.

paediatric wards and intensive care unit at Sibu Hospital
(Sarawak, Malaysia). The study was approved by the
Director of Health for Sarawak and the Ethics Committee
of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (UK).
Informed consent was obtained verbally from each child's
accompanying parent or guardian.
Case definitions
Figure 1 shows the algorithm of the investigation and the
classification of the disease severity of children with
HFMD in the study [9]. A child was defined as having
HFMD if they had new onset of at least one (≥ 1) of the
following: maculopapular or vesicular rash on the palms
and/or soles; vesicles or ulcers in the mouth or herpangina
(defined as multiple oral ulcers predominantly affecting
the posterior parts of the oral cavity). Children with
HFMD were considered to have more serious illness if
they have the following features: a history of fever, or fever
on examination (≥ 38°C), and ≥ 1 of the following features indicative of more serious illness: toxic and ill in
appearance, recurrent vomiting (at least twice), tachycardia (heart rate ≥ 150/min) breathlessness, poor perfusion
(cold clammy skin), reduced consciousness (irritability,
lethargy, drowsiness, coma), limb weakness, meningism
(neck stiffness or positive Kernig's sign), seizures. They
were subjected to CSF examination after written consent
to exclude central nervous system (CNS) involvement.
Children with > 5 cells/μL (i.e. CSF pleocytosis) and negative microscopy and culture for bacteria were classified as
"HFMD with CNS complications" (HFMD-CNS), while
those with normal CSF examination were considered to
have "severe HFMD without CNS involvement" (HFMDNon-CNS). Children with HFMD-CNS were diagnosed to
have aseptic meningitis (ASM) if they were fully conscious, had headache, meningism, and no focal neurological signs. Encephalitis was defined by the presence of
impaired consciousness including lethargy, drowsiness or
coma, seizures or myoclonus. Acute flaccid paralysis
(AFP) was characterized by the acute onset of areflexic
limb weakness. Cardiorespiratory failure was defined by
the presence of tachycardia, respiratory distress, pulmonary oedema, poor peripheral perfusion requiring inotropes, pulmonary congestion on chest radiography and
reduced cardiac contractility on echocardiography. Children without features of more serious illness were classified as "mild HFMD", and were observed in hospital until
they became afebrile for at least 12–24 hours. A child was
considered to be positive for HEV71 if HEV71 was isolated by tissue culture or HEV71 RNA was detected by
HEV71 specific RT-PCR from ≥ 1 clinical sample.

attention to mucocutaneous lesions, cardiovascular and
neurological signs. All details were recorded on standardized forms. Swabs were taken from the throat and rectum
of every patient, as well as ≥ 1 swab from vesicles on the
skin and oral ulcers (if present). The clinical samples were
stored immediately in a -70°C freezer until further testing.
Blood was taken for flavivirus serology, and in patients
with suspected CNS involvement for full blood count,
urea, electrolytes, and glucose. Electrocardiogram and
echocardiogram was also performed on children with suspected CNS involvement. CSF was examined for cell
count and differential, protein, glucose, Gram stain, bacterial culture and processed for viral studies. If there was a
strong clinical suspicion of viral CNS infection, but the
initial CSF examination was acellular, a second lumbar
puncture was performed. Lumbar punctures were delayed
in those with unstable vital signs. Patients were examined
daily or more frequently as indicated, by a member of the
study team. Children with HFMD-CNS complications
(particularly those with encephalitis and acute flaccid
paralysis) were treated with intravenous immunoglobulin
(IVIG) at the discretion of the treating physician [10].

were selected backward and remained in the model only
if they were statistically associated with neurological
involvement (p < 0.05). (SPSS software, Version 13.0;
SPSS). The association between the independent risk factors identified and neurological involvement were validated in the second phase of the study, where most
patients were admitted during the 2006 outbreak. The
utility of the identified risk factors as clinical predictors for
neurological involvement at the point of first contact for
care was also examined. Normally distributed data were
compared using Student's t test; data that were not normally distributed were compared by the Mann-Whitney U
test (Statview 4.02; Abacus Concepts). Differences
between proportions were tested using the Chi-square test
with Yates's correction or Fisher's exact test as appropriate
(Epi Info, version 6; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results

Virological methods
Virus isolation was attempted on all swab specimens, CSF
specimens, and any serum samples remaining after other
investigations had been completed through the inoculation of human rhabdomyosarcoma and human embryonic kidney cells. Isolated enteroviruses were typed by
nucleotide sequencing of VP1 and VP4 genes and genogrouped by phylogenetic analysis [11,12]. During the
2006 outbreak, in addition to virus isolation, all swab
specimens were also tested for presence of HEV71 RNA
using a HEV71 specific RT-PCR [13]. Paired serum samples (obtained on the day of admission and on day 7, or
on the day of discharge or after death) and CSF specimens
were also tested for IgM against dengue and Japanese
encephalitis virus (JEV) in parallel, using an IgM-capture
ELISA that distinguishes responses to these two viruses
[14].

A total of 725 children (457, 63% males) were recruited
between 1st January 2000 and 31st July 2003. Most children were recruited during 2 large outbreaks of HEV71HFMD that occurred during 2000/2001 and 2003. Five
hundred and forty (74%) children had mild HFMD. One
hundred and eighty five (26%) children had suspected
CNS involvement and required CSF examination; 102
(55%) of them had CSF pleocytosis (HFMD-CNS) and the
remaining 83 (45%) had normal CSF findings (HFMDNon-CNS). Of the 102 children with HFMD-CNS, 63
(62%) had ASM, 33 (32%) had encephalitis, 3 (3%) had
AFP, and 3 (3%) had encephalitis associated with cardiorespiratory failure (all of the 3 died). Of the 273 HEV71
culture positive children, 187 (69%) had mild HFMD, 34
(13%) had HFMD-Non-CNS, and 52 (19%) had HFMDCNS (30 had ASM, 19 had encephalitis, 1 had AFP and 2
had encephalitis with cardiorespiratory failure). Detailed
results of the epidemiology, diagnostic virology and
molecular epidemiology of this phase of the study have
been reported previously [9,15].

Statistical analysis
Data from HFMD patients recruited in the first phase of
the study (mostly during 2 outbreaks that occurred
between January 2000 and July 2003) were used to identify risk factors for neurological involvement (evident by
CSF pleocytosis). The primary analysis was for variables
associated with neurological involvement by comparing
children with HFMD-CNS (i.e. with CSF pleocytosis) to
those with HFMD-Non-CNS (i.e. no CSF pleocytosis).
Variables that were considered potentially useful to primary care doctors in identifying children with neurological involvement were included in a multiple logistic
regression analysis to look for independent risk factors for
neurological involvement (i.e. CSF pleocytosis). Variables

Clinical features
Comparison of patients with HFMD with CNS complications with
those had more serious HFMD without CNS involvement (January
2000 to July 2003)
The clinical features of the children with HFMD-CNS (i.e.
with CSF pleocytosis) are compared to those with HFMDNon-CNS (i.e. no CSF pleocytosis) (see Additional file 1).
Children with HFMD-CNS were more likely to be male
and of Chinese ethnic group. Children of Iban ethnic
group, however, were less likely to have HFMD with CNS
complications. Children with HFMD-CNS complications
were more likely to have higher mean peak temperature,
peak temperature ≥ 38.5°C, longer mean total duration of
fever and total duration of fever ≥ 3 days. Findings of leth-

argy (from the parent's history or physical examination),
faster mean heart rate, mean heart rate ≥ 150/min and
limb weakness on examination were more frequently
present in children with HFMD-CNS. There was no difference in the proportion of children with positive HEV71
isolation between children with HFMD-CNS and those
with HFMD-Non-CNS.
To look for independent risk factors that could be used to
predict neurological involvement evident by CSF pleocytosis, total duration of fever ≥ 3 days, peak temperature ≥
38.5°C, being lethargic (from the parent's history or physical findings), history of breathlessness, history of vomiting, history of or witnessed myoclonus, neck stiffness
were included in a multiple logistic regression analysis.
Total duration of fever ≥ 3 days, peak temperature ≥
38.5°C and history of lethargy were found to be independent risk factors of neurological involvement after
multivariate analysis (Table 1). Table 2 shows the number
and type of the risk factors that were present in the 725
children with HFMD seen during the first phase of the
study according to the disease severity. Two or more (≥ 2)
risk factors were present in 83% (85/102) of patients that
had HFMD-CNS when compared to 43% (36/83) of
patients with HFMD-Non-CNS (OR 6.53, 95% CI 3.15–
13.66, p < 0.0001). Further analysis on the HEV71-positive subset showed that ≥ 2 risk factors were present in
82% (43/52) of children with HFMD-CNS when compared to 32% (11/34) patients with HFMD-Non-CNS
(OR 9.99, 95%CI 3.26–31.82). A separate analysis on
children with mild HFMD showed that ≥ 2 risk factors
were present in 6% of cases with mild HFMD (32/
540)(Table 2), and HEV71-postive mild HFMD (11/187),
respectively.
Validation of the association between the risk factors and
neurological involvement in children with HFMD in 2006 outbreak
The association between the identified risk factors (total
duration of fever ≥ 3 days, peak temperature ≥ 38.5°C and
history of lethargy) and neurological involvement were
validated in the 2006 outbreak. A total of 730 children
with HFMD were admitted between January and December 2006. Two hundred and ninety four (40%) children

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/9/3

had mild HFMD. Four hundred and thirty six (60%) children had features of more serious illness and warranted
CSF examination; 250 (34%) of them had HFMD-CNS
and the remaining 186 (26%) had HFMD-Non-CNS. Of
the 250 children with HFMD-CNS, 65 (26%) had ASM,
172 (69%) had encephalitis, 2 (0.8%) had encephalitis
associated with AFP, and 11 (4.4%) had encephalitis associated with cardiorespiratory failure (6 of them died).
HEV71 was isolated from 157 (27%) of 586 children who
had virus isolation done. A further 44 (7%) children had
other HEVA (n = 29) and species B HEV (n = 15). No
patient had CVA16 isolated. HEV71RNA was detected in
239 (50%) of 477 children that were tested with HEV71
specific RT-PCR. In short, 291 (45%) of 653 children were
positive for HEV71. Of the 291 HEV71-positive children,
104 (36%) had mild HFMD, 73 (25%) had HFMD-NonCNS, 114 (39%) had HFMD-CNS (22 had ASM, 83 had
encephalitis, 2 had encephalitis associated with AFP, 7
had encephalitis associated with cardiorespiratory failure). HEV71 was detected in 4 (67%) of the 6 fatal case
children that had encephalitis associated with cardiorespiratory failure. The Additional file 2 shows the clinical features of the 730 children that were admitted during the
2006 outbreak according to the disease severity. Total
duration of fever ≥ 3 days, peak temperature ≥ 38.5°C and
history of lethargy were similarly more frequently present
in children with HFMD-CNS than those with HFMDNon-CNS. Two or more risk factors were present in 65%
(162/250) of children that had HFMD-CNS when compared with 30% (56/186) of children with HFMD-NonCNS (OR 4.27, 95%CI 2.79–6.56, p < 0.0001) (Table 2).
Among children with HEV71-positive HFMD, ≥ 2 risk factors were present in 61% (69/114) of children with
HFMD-CNS when compared with 26% (19/73) of children with HFMD-Non-CNS (OR 4.36, 95%CI 2.19–8.75,
p < 0.0001). A separate analysis on children with mild
HFMD showed that history of lethargy, total duration of
fever ≥ 3 days and peak temperature ≥ 38.5°C was present
in 6.4% (19/294), 11% (33/294) and 14% (42/294) of
the children with mild HFMD, respectively (Additional
file 2). Two or more 2 risk factors were found in only 5
(2%) of 294 with mild HFMD (Table 2) and in 1 (1%) of
104 of children with HEV71-positive mild HFMD.

The usefulness of the risk factors in predicting neurological
involvement in children with HFMD in the 2006 outbreak
We were particularly interested to assess the utility of the
three clinical risk factors in predicting neurological
involvement in children with HFMD at the point of first
contact for care. While a febrile illness ≥ 3 day was an
important risk factor for severity, primary care physicians
often see many children on the first 2 days of HFMD illness. To determine if peak temperature ≥ 38.5°C and history of lethargy are useful in identifying children who
sought treatment within the first 2 days of the febrile illness we performed a separate analysis for children who
presented within the first 2 days of the illness during the
2006 outbreak. Figure 2 shows the distribution and classification of disease severity of 730 children with HFMD in
the 2006 outbreak according to the duration of febrile illness and the risk factors that were present when they first
presented to hospital. Five hundred and seventy nine

(79%) of 730 children were admitted within the first 2
days of febrile illness. Sixty five (11%) of the 579 children
had history of lethargy plus peak temperature ≥ 38.5C. All
but two (97%) of the 65 children had features of more
serious illness and warranted CSF examination. About
three quarter of them had CSF pleocytosis and was classified as HFMD-CNS. Only 2 (3%) of the 65 children were
labeled as mild HFMD. Two hundred and twenty (38%)
children had only either history of lethargy or peak temperature ≥ 38.5C. Of the 167 (76%) children who warranted a CSF examination, 102 (61%) of them had CSF
pleocytosis, and were classified as HFMD-CNS. The
remaining 53 (24%) children without feature of more
serious illness were considered as mild HFMD. Two hundred and ninety four (51%) children had neither of the
two risk factors. Eighty four (29%) of the 294 children,
however, had other features of more serious illness, and
hence underwent CSF examination. CSF pleocytosis was

found in 24 (29%) of the 84 children, and were classified
as HFMD-CNS. Two hundred and ten (71%) of the 294
children without features of more serious illness were
labeled as mild HFMD. In summary CSF pleocytosis was
found in 48(74%) of 65 children with 2 risk factors (temperature ≥ 38.5°C and history of lethargy) on hospital

admission compared with that in 126 (25%) of 514 children with ≥ 1 risk factors (OR 8.69; 95%CI 4.66–16.37, p
< 0.0001).
One hundred and fifty one (21%) of the 730 children
were seen on the 3rd or later days of their febrile illness.

Twenty two (15%) of the 151 children had all the 3 risk
factors associated with neurological involvement. All the
22 children warranted CSF examination. Seventeen
(77%), including 4 fatal cases, of the 22 children had CSF
pleocytosis and were classified as HFMD-CNS. Of the 55
(36%) children that had 2 risk factors, all except one child
required CSF examination to exclude CNS involvement.
Forty (74%) of the 54 children had CSF pleocytosis and
were classified as HFMD-CNS. Being febrile for ≥ 3 days
was the sole risk factor in 74 (49%) of the 151 children.
Forty six (62%) children had features of more serious illness, and underwent CSF examination – 19 (41%) had
CSF pleocytosis and were classified as HFMD-CNS. The
remaining 28 (38%) children were labeled as mild
HFMD. In short CSF pleocytosis was found in 57(74%) of
77 children that had ≥ 2 risk factors on hospital admission
compared with in 19 (26%) of 74 children with isolated
risk factor of being febrile ≥ 3 days (OR 8.25; 95%CI
3.75–18.38, p < 0.0001). Further analysis on the HEV71positive subset showed that 24% (21/86) of children with
HFMD-CNS presented within the first 2 days of febrile illness had ≥ 2 risk factors compared with 10% (6/60) of
children with HFMD-Non-CNS (OR 2.91; 95% CI 1.03–
9.38, p = 0.0464). For the HEV71-positive children presented on the 3rd or later days of febrile illness, 71% (20/
28) of children with HFMD-CNS had ≥ 2 risk factors compared with 31% (4/13) of children with HFMD-Non-CNS
(OR 5.63; 95% CI 1.11–31.35, p = 0.0341). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the risk factors in predicting CSF
pleocytosis in children with HFMD at presentation in the
2006 outbreak is shown in Table 3.
Between 2000 and 2006, a total of 352 children with CNS
involvement were admitted into the study. One hundred

and twenty eight (36%) children had ASM (a mild and
benign CNS involvement) and 224 (64%) had severe and
potentially fatal CNS complications (205 had encephalitis, 14 had encephalitis associated with cardiorespiratory
failure, 2 had encephalitis associated with AFP, 3 had
AFP). Among the 224 children that had severe CNS complications, 204 (95%) of 215 children that survived had
timely hospital admission and IVIG treatment compared
to one (11%) of 9 children that died (OR 148.36, 95%CI
16.34–6609.04, p < 0.0001). Table 4 shows the clinical
details and the risk factors that were present in the 9 fatal
case children on hospital admission. Two or more risk factors associated with neurological involvement were
present in all the 9 fatal children, and were noted for ≥
24–48 hours before hospital admission.

Discussion
Early recognition of children at risk of neurological
involvement and death (particularly those with encephalitis and encephalomyelitis) is critical as the disease progression from the onset of neurological involvement to
fulminant cardiorespiratory failure may be remarkably
rapid [8]. However the clinical manifestations of neurological involvement may be very subtle, particularly in
young children with early CNS disease [8,16]. While the
signs of cardiorespiratory distress such as breathlessness,
tachypnea, tachycardia, poor perfusion are easy to recognize, they invariably appear very late shortly before most
fatal case collapsed. Our results and other published studies showed that timely diagnosis and intervention, including the use of IVIG infusion, may reduce acute mortality
[10,17-19]. Hence the primary care doctors are confronted with a clinical challenge of identifying a small
fraction of children who are at risk of neurological complication from an overwhelmingly large number of chil-

dren who would have uncomplicated course of HFMD.
For this reason it is important to find clinical predictors
for neurological involvement that can guide primary care
doctors perform a proper patient triage, which should be
aimed to admit high risk children into hospital early for
close observation and further management, while those at
low risk of neurological complication may be given outpatient care after parental education and advice. Few studies have systemically examined how to identify children at
risk early before they develop cardiorespiratory failure,
particularly at the primary care setting where the majority
of children with HFMD would first seek treatment during
a community outbreak of HFMD.
In this study we identified and validated that history of
lethargy, mean peak temperature ≥ 38.5°C and total duration of fever ≥ 3 days were important risk factors for neu-

rological involvement. Our study also shows that
neurological involvement occurs at early course of complicated HFMD, and may be detectable within the first 2
days of the febrile illness because CSF pleocytosis was
present in 174 (30%) of 579 children seen within the first
2 days of febrile illness, where they also formed 70%
(174/250) of children with HFMD-CNS in the 2006 outbreak (Figure 2). Since CSF pleocytosis may be detectable
within the first 2 days of the febrile illness and fulminant
cardiorespiratory failure seen in the fatal case children
typically occurred on the 3rd or later day of febrile illness,
it is imperative to attempt to identify children at risk of
neurological involvement before the 3rd day of febrile illness so that they can be admitted into hospital early for
close monitoring and investigation, and intervention may
be instituted when necessary.

Examination of body temperature and careful enquiry
into history of lethargy, duration of fever and home
record of body temperature should form an integral part
of HFMD patient triage at the primary care level. The three
risk factors are readily elicited, and can also be used after
minimal training by paramedics, who are the key primary
care providers in many developing countries including in
Sarawak (Malaysia) in Asia. The parents of children with
HFMD can also play an important role in early diagnosis
of neurological complication in children with HFMD.
They should be educated about the 3 risk factors, and be
encouraged to monitor the children's body temperature
regularly and observe the children's physical activity
closely. Body temperature ≥ 38.5°C and history of lethargy may be particularly useful clinical clues for neurological involvement during the first 2 days of febrile illness
since at this time the presentation of complicated HFMD
is typically undifferentiated and subtle, even to the experienced clinicians [8]. Indeed both history of lethargy and
temperature ≥ 38.5°C were observed for 24–48 hours in
all the 9 fatal case children before they succumbed to
unexpected fulminant cardiorespiratory failure (Table 4).
Primary care doctors should have high index of suspicions
of neurological complication when they are presented
with children with HFMD who have been febrile ≥ 3 days.
The children should be admitted into hospital for close
observation and investigated for CNS involvement, if necessary. Our study showed that 92 (31%) of 293 children
with total duration of fever ≥ 3 days in the 2000/3 outbreak, and 183 (61%) of 300 children in the 2006 outbreak had neurological involvement (Table 2). CSF
pleocytosis was present in 25% (19/74) of children with a
single risk factor of being febrile ≥ 3 days on hospital
admission (Figure 2). The risk of CNS complication is
increased significantly when there are added risk factors of
having history of lethargy and temperature ≥ 38.5°C. In
contrast children who have a brief duration of low grade
fever (≥ 38.5°C) and no history of lethargy are of low risk
of neurological disease, and may be provided with outpatient care and parental reassurance.
Our results are in keeping with findings reported by
Chang and co-authors where fever ≥ 39°C, fever duration
≥ 3 days and lethargy were more frequently observed in
children with CNS involvement and in children with
HEV71-HFMD than in those with CVA16-HFMD [8,20].
Although several other clinical features and laboratory
abnormalities have been associated with fatal HEV71HFMD, they have yet been validated, and been shown
useful in detecting neurological disease or disease progression [8,21,22]. For example, Chong and co-authors
reported that absence of mouth ulcers predicted a more
complicated or fatal HFMD, and have recommended that
children without mouth ulcers should be monitored
closely [22]. However, in our study we did not find that

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/9/3

children without mouth ulcers were more likely than children with mouth ulcers to have features of more severe
HFMD or develop neurological complication. Not all the
risk factors identified in these published studies can readily be translated into clinical practice, particularly at primary care settings. Hyperglycemia and leucocytosis have
been shown as risk factors for fatal HEV71 disease [8].
However, in our experience hyperglycemia and leucocytosis are late laboratory changes in children with fulminant
cardiorespiratory failure (unpublished observations), and
thus are not helpful clinically in identifying children at
high risk of complication and death. Elevated cardiac Troponin I, a sensitive cardiac-specific biomarker for myocardial injury, has been noted in children who subsequently
developed left ventricular failure, and may be useful in
identifying patients at risk of left ventricular failure and
pulmonary oedema [21]. Although cardiac Troponin I has
been used widely in developed countries for early diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome, it is expensive and not
widely available in many developing countries, including
in Sarawak. Screening for heart rate variability abnormalities, an index of autonomic nervous system, through
non-invasive continuous ECG monitoring may provide
early warning of impending cardiorespiratory failure
about 7 hours before its onset [16]. The labour-intensive
approach is most suited in a critical care setting for children already diagnosed of CNS involvement because it
requires the use of expensive and sophisticated device,
and close monitoring for the heart rate abnormalities.
A limitation of our study is that the clinical predictors
developed for use at primary care setting were identified
and tested using data collected through a hospital-based
study. Clinical characteristics of children treated at primary care settings may differ from hospitalized children.
However, as a large number of children with mild HFMD
were admitted into our study, we had the opportunity to
systemically examine the clinical feature of HFMD of varying severity, including children with mild disease that
would normally be treated at primary care clinics, where
we have shown history of lethargy, peak temperature
38.5C and total duration of fever 3 days were reported
infrequently in children with mild HFMD.

Conclusion
Currently there is no vaccine against HEV71 infection.
Early recognition of children at risk of fulminant pulmonary oedema and cardiac dysfunction is the key to reduce
acute mortality and morbidity. We have identified three
clinical risk factors that may help detect children at risk of
neurological involvement and death at primary care settings, which can guide primary care doctors decide if hospital admission is warranted when they see with children
with HFMD. These risk factors are readily elicited through
history taking and measurement of body temperature.

They may also provide useful guide to help clinicians to
decide the need for CSF examination, as well as to monitor disease progression in children with HFMD.
