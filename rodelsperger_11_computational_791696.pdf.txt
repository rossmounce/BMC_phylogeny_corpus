Computational archaeology of the Pristionchus
pacificus genome reveals evidence of horizontal
gene transfers from insects
Christian Rödelsperger and Ralf J Sommer*

Abstract
Background: The recent sequencing of nematode genomes has laid the basis for comparative genomics
approaches to study the impact of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) on the adaptation to new environments and the
evolution of parasitism. In the beetle associated nematode Pristionchus pacificus HGT events were found to involve
cellulase genes of microbial origin and Diapausin genes that are known from beetles, but not from other
nematodes. The insect-to-nematode horizontal transfer is of special interest given that P. pacificus shows a tight
association with insects.
Results: In this study we utilized the observation that horizontally transferred genes often exhibit codon usage
patterns more similar to that of the donor than that of the acceptor genome. We introduced GC-normalized
relative codon frequencies as a measure to detect characteristic features of P. pacificus orphan genes that show no
homology to other nematode genes. We found that atypical codon usage is particularly prevalent in P. pacificus
orphans. By comparing codon usage profiles of 71 species, we detected the most significant enrichment in insectlike codon usage profiles. In cross-species comparisons, we identified 509 HGT candidates that show a significantly
higher similarity to insect-like profiles than genes with nematode homologs. The most abundant gene family
among these genes are non-LTR retrotransposons. Speculating that retrotransposons might have served as carriers
of foreign genetic material, we found a significant local clustering tendency of orphan genes in the vicinity of
retrotransposons.
Conclusions: Our study combined codon usage bias, phylogenetic analysis, and genomic colocalization into a
general picture of the computational archaeology of the P. pacificus genome and suggests that a substantial
fraction of the gene repertoire is of insect origin. We propose that the Pristionchus-beetle association has facilitated
HGT and discuss potential vectors of these events.

Background
The unique genetic repertoire that allows organisms to
adapt to environmental changes and to conquer ecological niches has undergone an enormous evolutionary
history. Evolutionary events such as speciation, gene
duplication, and loss, accompanied by changes on the
single nucleotide level, have generated an overwhelming
amount of diversity in all domains of life. In addition to
the continuous transfer of genetic material to the subsequent generations by means of inheritance, a number of
examples are known where genes are transferred across

species borders. Such cases of horizontal gene transfer
(HGT) commonly occur in prokaryotes [1,2]. More
recently, a number of HGT events have been reported in
nematodes [3-6]. The nematode Pristionchus pacificus
has initially been introduced as a satellite system for
comparison to developmental processes of Caenorhabditis elegans [7]. P. pacificus has a necromenic lifestyle. In
the wild, it exists in the form of dauer larvae in association with scarab beetles [8]. Dauer larvae only resume
development and become adult worms after the death of
the beetle. Initial analysis of the genome sequence identified seven cellulase genes which are of microbial origin
[9]. In contrast to cellulases in plant parasitic nematodes,
P. pacificus cellulases originate from independent HGT

events [3,9]. One striking feature of the P. pacificus genome is that for more than a third of the 24,231 predicted
genes, no homologous sequences exist in any other
organism. However, over 50% of these genes show evidence for expression in the form of expressed sequence
tag (EST) data [10]. Thus the origin of these so called
‘pioneer genes’ remains unclear. One open question is
whether these genes are Pristionchus-specific inventions
or whether they have been integrated by means of HGT.
The lack of homology to any known protein sequence is
an ultimate impediment to any kind of phylogenetic analysis. Therefore, alternative approaches for sequence
comparisons are preferable to further characterize these
genes.
Early after the initial sequencing of the Escherichia coli
genome, computational approaches were used to elucidate
the molecular archaeology of the E. coli genome [1]. This
involved the identification of foreign DNA introduced by
HGT. Most of the detection methods for so called “alien”
DNA search for sequences that differ from the rest of the
genome with respect to a certain feature such as dinucleotide distribution [11,12] or codon usage [1,13,14].
In this study we will compare codon usage profiles of
P. pacificus genes within and across genomes. Focusing on
orphan genes that do not show homology to any other
nematode sequence, we use dozens of genomewide profiles for nematodes, bacteria, fungi, insects and plants to
show that the P. pacificus orphan genes are strongly
enriched in insect-like codon usage. In cases where
homology data is available, genes with predicted insectlike codon usage show a significant association with HGT
candidates defined by cross-species homology. In a more
detailed analysis of the common HGT candidates, we
investigate the role of retrotransposons in the prospective
transfer of genetic material from insects to the P. pacificus
genome.

Results
Orphan genes are associated with atypical codon usage

Every genome has a unique pattern of relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) (see [15] for review). Alternative synonymous codon usage has been associated with
tRNA abundances, translational robustness, mRNA secondary structures and genomic GC content. Consistent
with this observation, differences across genomes are
greater than differences within genomes. Thus recently
introduced genes may be identified when their codon
usage bears greater resemblance to the donor than the
acceptor genome. As a consequence, methods have been
developed to detect alien genes with atypical codon usage
profiles relative to the genomewide average [1,13,14].
Foremost, we tested if atypical RSCU profiles of
P. pacificus could be used to detect genes that presumably
originate from species outside of the nematode phylum.

To do so, we determined whether genes with atypical
RSCU profiles are enriched in the set of 9217 P. pacificus
orphan genes, i.e. genes that do not have a homolog in any
other nematode species (see Methods). One confounding
factor in the measurement of atypical codon usage is the
genomewide variation of GC content; it has been shown
that codon usage in nematodes is largely affected by variations in GC content across different species [16]. To assess
the impact of GC content on codon usage we calculated
the average RSCU profile for P. pacificus and tested
whether the Euclidean distance between the genomewide
profile and the RSCU profiles of individual genes correlate
with differences in GC content of the third codon position
(GC3). We indeed found good correlations between deviations in RSCU and GC3 content (r = 0.57, Pearson, Figure
1A). In addition, we observed a correlation of r = 0.44
between intronic GC content and GC3 content (Figure
1B), suggesting that intraspecies-specific genomic variations in GC content largely affect variations in RSCU profiles for individual genes.
To decrease the impact of GC content on RSCU values,
we introduced GC-normalized RSCU values which drop
the assumption that all synonymous codons are equally
likely. This also takes into account the GC3 content of the
whole gene in the calculation of expected codon frequencies (see Methods). GC normalization substantially
decreases the correlation between RSCU differences and
differences in GC3 content to r = 0.21 (Figure 1C). Additional file 1 shows the distribution of GC-normalized
RSCU deviation from the genomewide profile. We subsequently tested whether the three deviation measures
RSCU, GC-normalized RSCU, and GC3 are associated
with P. pacificus orphan genes. We ranked all genes
according to decreasing values of each deviation measure
and calculated the fraction of orphans in the set of most
atypical genes, as defined by various cutoffs. Figure 1D
shows the resulting cumulative distribution of orphan
genes with respect to the three measures. In comparison
to the deviation in RSCU and GC3, the GC-normalized
RSCU measure shows a strong enrichment (up to two-fold
for the first 5%) of P. pacificus orphan genes (P = 0.0002,
one-sample KS-test). Differences in non-normalized RSCU
yield an enrichment in orphan genes that is two orders of
magnitude less significant (P = 0.02). In contrast, deviation
in GC3 content alone shows no significant enrichment at
all (P = 1). These results suggest that a large fraction of P.
pacificus orphan genes show indeed atypical patterns of
synonymous codon usage, a trend that cannot be
explained by variation in GC3 content.
Orphan genes show elevated levels of insect-like codon
usage

Next we sought to explore if the atypical codon usage
could be used to identify the donor through which these

Figure 1 P. pacificus orphan genes are enriched in atypical codon usage. (A) For all P. pacificus genes with >100 codons, RSCU values were
computed, and RSCU and GC3 deviation of a single gene from the genomewide average were plotted. Both values show a substantial
correlation indicating that RSCU values are strongly biased by GC3 variation. (B) Correlation between GC3 and intronic GC content suggests that
this bias is due to genomic variation in GC content and not specific for individual transcripts. (C) GC-normalization of RSCU values strongly
reduces the correlation between deviation in GC3 and codon usage bias. (D) Cumulative distribution of P. pacificus orphan genes that were
ranked by their deviation from the genomewide average of RSCU, GC-normalized RSCU and GC3 content. Genes with most atypical codon

genes entered the P. pacificus genome. To this end, we
compiled a data set of coding sequences totaling 71 bacterial, fungal, amoebozoa, plant, and insect genomes and
tested whether orphan genes show a tendency for
enrichment in a particular taxonomic group. First, we
calculated genomewide GC-normalized RSCU profiles
for each species and assigned individual genes to the
species with the closest Euclidean distance in RSCU
profiles. This “nearest neighbor” approach was able to

predict the correct species in 34.4% of the cases and the
correct taxonomic group in 71.7% (Table 1). While classification errors exist, they represent a minority of genes
and vary across taxonomic groups. For example, it is
much more likely that a randomly selected insect gene
is mispredicted as a nematode gene (~22% misclassifications, Table 1) than vice versa (~12% misclassifications,
Table 1). Given the correct classification of genes in the
majority of cases, the nearest neighbor method is well

Accuracy was measured using ten randomized data sets including equal number of sequences per species (see Methods). For each taxonomic group (rows), we
calculated the mean percentage of predictions for all possible classifications, the “*” indicates the predicted taxonomic group (columns). For instance, while
61.1% of insect genes are correctly recognized as insect sequences based on their codon usage, 22.0% are mistaken as nematode genes.

however, the genomewide distribution may serve as a
baseline level for comparison with subsets of genes. If
we consider only orphan genes, nematode-like codon
usage is strongly depleted. Interestingly, the most significant enrichment for orphan genes is observed in insectlike codon usage (P <10-54, Fisher’s exact test). Specifically, 8.5% of the analyzed orphan genes are classified as
insect genes. When applied to the whole genome, this
value represents 54.7% of all genes that are classified as
insect genes and denotes a ~1.8 fold enrichment relative
to all genes (Figure 2B).

suited to suggest the taxonomic group of a potential
donor species for HGT events. In addition to the nearest neighbor approach, we also applied a classification
method based on random forests [17] and tested this
method on GC-normalized RSCU as well as nonnormalized RSCU values and taking into account gene
size and GC3 content. However this method did not
qualitatively change the results.
Next, we used the nearest neighbor approach to assign
all P. pacificus genes to taxonomic groups. Figure 2A
shows the distribution of taxonomic group classification
results. 86.5% of P. pacificus genes are classified as
nematode genes. The remaining 13.5% is distributed
among fungi (6.8%), insect (4.8%), plants (1.2%), and
bacteria (0.6%). This distribution is most likely influenced by the classification error discussed previously;

evidence of HGT from insects by comparing the results
obtained from our codon usage analysis to HGT candidates defined by cross-species homology. We compiled
a database including nematode as well as insect protein
sequences to test whether HGT candidates defined by
cross-species homology show a significant association
with insect-like codon usage. We searched the blastp
results for two classes of genes that would give rise to
HGT candidates. First, we looked for P. pacificus orphan
genes that had no homologous sequence in other nematodes but had a blastp hit (e-value <0.001) in insects
(class I). Second, we scanned for genes with homologs
in other nematodes but with a minimum thousand fold
smaller blastp e-value for a hit against any insect protein
(class II). We identified 205 class I and 304 class II HGT
candidates. The 509 HGT candidates with best blastp
hits, taxonomic group predictions, and PFAM domains
are presented in additional file 2.
Most of the HGT candidates were predicted to be
nematode genes based on their codon usage, i.e. 76.5% of
class I and 84.7% of class II HGT candidates. This result
indicates that the majority of genes acquired by HGT
have been adapted to the codon usage of the host
genome, an observation that has also been suggested by
Karlin et al. [13]. Alternatively, this finding might be due
to the similarity between the codon usage profiles of the
donor and host genomes.
However, for the remaining HGT candidates, evidence
for the taxonomic group of donors can be obtained. 9%
of class II HGT candidates exhibit insect-like codon
usage, which represents a significant 1.9 fold enrichment
relative to the fraction of predicted insect-like codon
usage among all genes (P <10-5, Fisher’s exact test). For
the 205 class I candidates there was no enrichment in
insect-like codon usage, but a 1.3 fold enrichment in predicted fungal profiles (see Discussion) which is in contrast
to the 9217 orphan genes (see above). To test whether
both classes of HGT candidates show a higher similarity
to insect-like codon usages than genes with nematode
homologs, we considered relative rather than absolute
distances of single genes to genomewide profiles of
nematodes, fungi, and insects. In particular, we used the
distance relative to the sum of nematode, fungal and
insect distances, where Drosophila and Aspergillus represent insects and fungi, respectively. We found that both
HGT candidate classes show a significant reduction in
distance to the Drosophila profile (P <10-13 for class I
candidates and P <0.01 for class II candidates, Wilcoxon
test, Figure 2C).
These results suggest, that despite the close similarity
between insect, fungal, and nematode codon usages,
HGT candidates defined by cross-species homology show
a significantly increased similarity to insect-like codon
usages. Taken together, the genomewide computational

analysis of HGT candidates defined by cross-species
homology supports an association with insect-like codon
usage.
Phylogenetic analysis reveals integration of non-LTR
retrotransposons

To elucidate what genes could have been acquired by
P. pacificus, we looked more closely into the gene sets
identified by cross-species homologies. First, we used the
previously identified Diapausin gene as a control [9]. Diapausins encode diapause-specific peptides that provide
antifungal activity by acting as Ca2+ channel blockers
[18]. Among the HGT candidates supported by crossspecies homologies and predicted insect-like codon
usage, we indeed identified two genes that showed closest
similarity to Diapausins from Spodoptera and Gastrophysa. The P. pacificus genome contains four other
members of this gene family (PF08036.4) which are all
among the HGT candidates defined by cross-species
homology; Figure 3A shows a phylogenetic tree of this
gene family. All P. pacificus Diapausin genes originate
from a common sequence and show closest similarity to
the leaf beetle Diapausin. This positive control confirms
the effectiveness of our approach towards the identification of HGT candidates.
Table 2 shows the 20 most abundant PFAM domains
that were found in the set of 509 HGT candidates
defined by cross-species homology. The two most abundant domains correspond to a reverse transcriptase
(PF00078.20) and endonuclease domain (PF03372.16).
Both domains also occur in HGT candidates that are
supported by cross-species homologies and predicted
insect-like codon usage. These genes are remote homologs of the C. elegans retrotransposable element Rte-1
[19], a member of the non-LTR retrotransposable elements. Rte-1 encodes an endonuclease and a reverse
transcriptase enclosed by target site duplication
sequences at the 5’ and 3’ end. Similar examples of a
Rte-1-like HGT events have been reported from plants
to fish and from arthropods to reptiles [20]. A more
recent phylogenetic analysis observed a greater similarity
of a P. pacificus reverse transcriptase to that of Bombyx
mori sequences without any further discussion [21].
In total, the P. pacificus genome encodes 159 genes
with a strong similarity to reverse transcriptase domains
(e-value <0.001). 70 of these domains exhibit a higher
similarity to a reverse transcriptase from insects than to
the closest homolog within the nematode phylum. The
remaining reverse transcriptase domains have closest
homologs in other nematodes. Together, these findings
indicate that the P. pacificus genome contains ancient
homologs of the C. elegans Rte-1 elements as well as
copies that might have originated from insects. Figure 3B
shows a phylogenetic tree of reverse transcriptase

proteins including two P. pacificus genes with closest
homologs in insects.
Orphan genes and HGT candidates preferentially
colocalize near retrotransposons

The HGT candidates supported by cross-species homologies and predicted insect-like codon usage contain, in
addition to the non-LTR retrotransposons, a second retrotransposon associated gene. This gene shows highest
similarity to a gene prediction encoding a gag protein of
a retrotransposon (PF03732.10, e-value <10-16) from the
red flower beetle Tribolium castaneum (see additional
file 2). Gag proteins are known to mediate the telomerspecific transposition of retrotransposons for telomer
maintenance in Drosophila [22].
The discovery of retrotransposons in HGT candidates
led us to wonder whether retrotransposons are not only
detectable outcomes of HGT events, but are possible
mediators of HGT by cotransposition of intervening
genes. A number of studies reported transfers of genetic
material across species borders by means of molecular

parasites. These reports include the transfer of P elements between Drosophila species [23] and a transfer of
a fungal endonuclease gene into an intron of the coxl
gene in the plant Peperomia polybotrya [24] (see [25] for
review).
Therefore, we searched for endonuclease and reverse
transcriptase bounded intervals of up to 40 kb in the
P. pacificus genome. We identified one prominent example that encompasses 10 genes, which are bounded by an
endonuclease and a reverse transcriptase in the same
orientation (Figure 3C). Out of the eight intervening
genes, only one is found in other nematodes, whereas no
homologous sequence could be detected for the remaining ones. This suggests that retrotransposons are able to
carry more than just the genes required for transposon
activity.
Next, we tested for a genomewide tendency of orphan
genes to cluster in the vicinity of retrotransposons and
searched for significant enrichment of orphan genes and
class II HGT candidates in their vicinity. We first defined a
reference set of all retrotransposon genes (reverse

transcriptases (PF00078.20), endonucleases (PF03372.16),
and gag proteins (PF03732.10)) with higher similarity to
insects than to nematodes. We then repeatedly sampled
non-overlapping genomic locations of equal number and
size distribution as that of the merged 30 kb upstream and
downstream regions of the retrotransposon genes. In total,
these regions span 5.2 Mb and encompass 352 orphan
genes and class II HGT candidates, representing a 1.15 ±
0.08 fold enrichment relative to randomly sampled genomic
locations (P = 0.034, 1000 iterations). Thus, HGT candidates nonetheless show a tendency to cluster around retrotransposon genes. However, we could not detect any
significant trend towards either upstream or downstream
regions of reverse transcriptases and endonucleases. These
findings are in agreement with the assumption that insect
retrotransposons might have been used as vectors for integration of foreign DNA into the P. pacificus genome.
HGT candidates defined by cross-species homology are
conserved in the genus Pristionchus

An association with retrotransposons suggests that more
or less random genetic material has been integrated into
the P. pacificus genome. For evolutionary significance of
HGT events, integration into the host biology and permanence are required [26]. Even if foreign DNA can be
integrated into a host genome, it will be rapidly
degraded by neutral evolution, unless it will prove beneficial for the host. To test, whether the HGT candidates

have been introduced into the P. pacificus genome only
recently, we searched for homologous sequences in the
low coverage genomes of Pristionchus entomophagus
and Pristionchus maupasi (blastn e-value <0.001) [9].
We found homologous sequences for 218 (41.6%) of
HGT candidates in at least one other Pristionchus species, 105 (20.6%) of HGT candidates showed evidence
for conservation in both species, indicating that a substantial fraction of HGT candidates date back to ancestral sequences within the genus Pristionchus. However,
more data will be needed to evaluate whether these
genes evolve neutrally or are under any kind of evolutionary constraint.

Discussion
Novel sequencing technologies have dramatically
increased the number of available genome sequences over
the last few years. However, the biological value of a new
genome sequence is limited due to the lack of knowledge
about homologous sequences in other organisms. The
absence of homology to any known sequence, as in the
case for a large fraction of P. pacificus genes [9,10], exemplifies our lack of knowledge about the genome content of
this model organism. Therefore, we have started to complement the available P. pacificus genome, transcriptome
and proteome data with next generation sequencing
approaches of related species [3,9]. This approach has
facilitated a mechanistic understanding of some of the

Rödelsperger and Sommer BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:239
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/239

HGT events that occurred in the evolutionary lineage
giving rise to P. pacificus. For cellulase genes acquired
from microbes, P. pacificus and related Pristionchus nematodes show functional assimilation, high gene turnover
and rapid sequence diversification associated with positive
selection [3].
In P. pacificus, the scarab beetle-associated ecology
might result in a number of potential donors for HGT.
The decaying beetle is an ecosystem consisting of bacteria, fungi, nematodes and presumably, a large number
of unicellular eukaryotes. The previously described
examples of cellulase and Diapausin genes clearly indicate that microbes and insects, at least, must be considered as potential HGT donors into the P. pacificus
genome. One inroad into the identification of HGT
events is a computational archaeology approach as originally described for E. coli [1].
In this study we have hypothesized that a substantial
fraction of the P. pacificus orphans might be introduced
into the genome by means of HGT. Hereby we refer to
an orphan gene as a gene with no similarity to any other
nematode sequence. Under the assumption that some
horizontally transferred genes may exhibit a codon usage
bias that is more similar to the donor genome than to the
acceptor genome [1,13], we could show that a fraction of
P. pacificus orphans exhibits an atypical codon usage
relative to the rest of the genome. The fact that the
majority of orphan genes show a codon usage typical for
nematodes might be due to two circumstances. First,
HGT events most likely occurred repeatedly with more
recent HGT events preferentially showing a codon usage
bias. Second, with multiple potential donors, no common
patterns of atypical codon usage are expected. For example, nematodes, insects and fungi show closely related
codon usage patterns, whereas protozoans and other
microbes, all of which are potential donors for HGT,
exhibit very different codon usages. In our analysis, we
found a similarity in codon usages for insects, nematodes
and fungi. GC-normalized RSCU distances of P. pacificus
genes to the genomewide profiles of P. pacificus, Drosophila melanogaster, and Aspergillus nidulans showed
strong correlations (r >0.87, Pearson). This circumstance
highlights the need for a careful investigation of potential
HGT events. We consider the work presented in this
study as a novel computational entry road towards the
identification of HGT patterns in P. pacificus.
In addition to the strong association of orphan genes
with atypical codon usage, we could characterize this
codon usage pattern by comparison to genomewide profiles for 71 species corresponding to six taxonomic
groups. The extent to which codon usage profiles can
predict species and taxonomic groups is still limited.
However, comparisons of subsets of genes against all
genes may help uncover the domain or phylum, from

Page 8 of 11

which these genes entered the P. pacificus genome. The
most significant enrichment was detected for insect-like
codon usage (P <10-54).
It is important to note that atypical patterns of codon
usage may also arise from other sources such as translational efficiency or secondary structures (see [15] for
review). Thus analysis of codon usage alone may not be
sufficient to support the proposed HGT events. We
therefore complemented this analysis by cross-species
comparisons to identify genes that show greatest similarity to homologs in insects.
We identified 509 HGT candidates using homology
searches against a combined nematode and insect protein
database and scanning for genes bearing greater resemblance to insect genes than to the closest homologs within
the nematode phylum. These HGT candidates showed a
significantly higher similarity to insect-like codon usage
profiles. Further investigations revealed that in addition to
the previously identified Diapausins (Table 2) [9], many of
these genes encode endonuclease and reverse transcriptase
proteins. Since 70 of the 159 P. pacificus reverse transcriptase sequences show a higher degree of similarity to those
of insects, we speculate that reintroduction of these elements from insects represents one mechanism by which
P. pacificus has acquired genes. Phylogenetic analysis of all
HGT candidates identified by cross-species homology
could provide more detailed information and further support for the proposed HGT events. Although P. pacificus
is not an insect parasitic nematode, dauer larvae of P. pacificus are in constant physical contact with beetles [27].
After the death of the beetle, nematodes resume development and feed on microorganisms growing on the carcass,
presumably for several generations [28]. Close physical
contact between donor and recipient has been proposed
as one criteria for HGT [5], making beetles a plausible
candidate for HGT donors. While our data suggests that a
substantial fraction of P. pacificus orphans originates from
insect genomes, it is possible that HGT involves vectors as
intermediate carriers. It is known that many viruses coexist with insects often in a species-specific interaction, so
viruses are obvious candidates for HGT into P. pacificus.
This hypothesis is supported by the finding that parts of
the Diapausin genes found in leaf beetles and P. pacificus
have also been observed in iridoviruses [18]. We therefore
hypothesize that viruses are potential intermediate carriers
that promote HGT events from insects into P. pacificus.
Our data however, strongly support a second scenario.
We identified a large number of non-LTR retrotransposon sequences in the P. pacificus genome that have
highest sequence similarity to insects. In addition to
permanence, integration into the host’s biology is one
necessary features of HGT [26]. The non-LTR retrotransposons are unlikely to have a beneficial effect on the
biology of P. pacificus. Thus the strong enrichment of

Rödelsperger and Sommer BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:239
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/239

retrotransposon associated genes among HGT candidates defined by cross-species homology seems counterintuitive. One explanation for this observation is that
retrotransposons might have served as carriers of foreign
genetic material into the P. pacificus genome. This
hypothesis is supported by the fact that we detected a
tendency for orphan genes and other HGT candidates
to be colocalized near retrotransposon genes. It could
provide one possible explanation for the presence of foreign retrotransposons and could serve as a model for
how other genes might have integrated into the P. pacificus genome. An open question is the permanence of
the transferred genetic material. Comparison with other
Pristionchus species indicates, that a substantial fraction
of HGT candidate dates back to ancestral Pristionchus
sequences. However, more data from wild isolates will
be needed to robustly measure the amount of selection
acting on these genes.

Conclusions
The computational archaeology of the P. pacificus genome
combines analysis of codon usage bias with phylogenetic
analysis, both of which reveal evidence of HGT events
from insects. We identified colocalized gene clusters surrounded by non-LTR retrotransposons, suggesting a
mechanism of HGT that involves transposable elements
[23,24]. This study highlights that multiple computational
approaches are necessary to obtain an overview of HGT
and other potential genomewide mechanisms contributing
to the evolution of eukaryotic genomes.
Methods
Identification of orphan genes

We used the gene predictions for 24,231 Pristionchus
pacificus genes [10] and downloaded gene annotations
for 30,163 Caenorhabditis elegans transcripts (WS220),
21,991 Caenorhabditis briggsae transcripts (WS223), and
21,332 from Brugia malayi transcripts (WS222).
We compiled a protein sequence database for all nonPristionchus nematode protein sequences which
included 20,359 Meloidogyne incognita proteins obtained
from the M. incognita resources website [29], 157,761
protein translations of non-P. pacificus nematode ESTs
from nematode.net [30] and non-Pristionchus nematode
sequences from the UniRef90 database. We then
searched this database for P. pacificus homologs using
NCBI blastp (version 2.2.22) [31].
For 15,014 (62.0%) of P. pacificus genes, at least one
nematode homolog with e-value <0.001 could be identified. This translates to 9217 (38.0%) orphan genes.
GC content and codon usage profiles

To eliminate biases due to recent gene expansions or
alternatively spliced transcripts in the genomewide

Page 9 of 11

calculation of RSCU profiles, we clustered all transcripts
with ≥ 80% sequence identity using cd-hit-est [32] (version 4.3 with -c 0.8 options).
We further restricted the analysis of codon usage to
only those transcripts with at least 100 codons. This
reduced the number of P. pacificus transcripts to 19,515,
6370 of which are in the set of orphan genes. For each
transcript with at least 100 codons, we determined the
GC3 content for the whole gene and then calculated the
GC-normalized RSCU values for a codon x as
RSCUGC (x) =

fob (x)
,
fexp (x)

(1)

where fob(x) denotes the observed frequency of codon x
among all synonymous codons and fexp(x) is calculated as
fexp (x) =

p(x|GC3)
,
y∈syn(x) p(y|GC3)

(2)

where syn(x) denotes the set of all synonymous
codons for x and p(x|GC3) indicates the probability of
codon x for a given GC3 content. p(x|GC3) is calculated
as the product of the three individual nucleotide probabilities given the GC3 content
p(x|GC3) = GC3k × (1 − GC3)3−k ,

(3)

whereby k denotes the number of nucleotides that are
either G or C. Deviation in RSCU values for single
genes was computed as the Euclidean distance to the
average genomewide RSCU profile. Analogously deviation in GC3 for a single gene was calculated as the
absolute difference from the genomewide average GC3
content.
Transcriptome and EST data

We downloaded protein coding transcript annotations
for 15 bacterial and 12 fungal genomes from Ensembl
Bacterial and Fungal Mart (Release 8), and unique
representative EST sequences from UniGene for 5 plant,
8 insect, and 1 amoebozoa species. These representative
sequences were defined as the sequence with the longest
region of high-quality sequence data for each UniGene
EST cluster. In addition we downloaded nematode consensus EST sequences from nematode.net [30,33].
For each EST sequence we identified the coding
sequence (CDS) as the longest sequence with no stop
codons among all 6 potential reading frames; for that
sequence, the transcript could start either at the first
codon or at the last ATG. If the longest sequence was
at least 300 bp long and the second longest was at most
150 bp long, we used this CDS for further analysis.
We obtained 17,189 transcripts for red harvester ant
Pogonomyrmex barbatus (Gene Set v1.2) from the

Rödelsperger and Sommer BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:239
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/239

Hymenoptera Genome Database [34], 21,899 Drosophila
melanogaster transcripts from the Ensembl 61 database,
14,623 transcripts for silkworm Bombyx mori from
SilkDB [35], 11,062 transcripts for honey bee Apis mellifera (PreRelease2 OGS) from BeeBase [34], and 18,249
sequences for red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum
from the Tribolium castaneum Genome Project website
(Tcas2.0) [36].
Prediction of species and taxonomic groups based on
RSCU profiles

To predict species given the GC-normalized RSCU
values of a single gene, we compared the RSCU profile
of the gene with genomewide profiles for all species and
assigned it to the nearest neighbor, which we defined as
the species with the closest Euclidean distance between
RSCU profiles.
The accuracy of the nearest neighbor method for species and taxonomic group predictions was calculated as
the fraction of correct predictions among all predictions.
The reported accuracies are based on ten evaluations of
data sets for 71 species (13 insects, 15 bacteria, 25
nematodes, 12, fungi, 5 plants and 1 amoebozoa) with
more than 1000 sequences containing greater than 100
codons. From each species 333 sequences were randomly drawn and put into the validation set.
Identification of HGT candidates by cross-species
homology and phylogenetic analysis

To define HGT candidates we combined the nematode
proteins with protein translations for the five insect genomes and insect and arthropod sequences from the UniRef90 data base. We searched for class I and II HGT
candidates in the resulting set of 721,041 protein
sequences using blastp.
For the non-LTR retrotransposon reverse transcriptase
we used the program hmmsearch from the HMMer
package (version 3.0) to scan the nematode and insect
protein sequences for presence of a reverse transcriptase
(1239 PF00078.20 hits with e-value <10-10) domain. This
set was extended by eight P. pacificus reverse transcriptases supported by cross-species homologies and predicted insect-like codon usage. To reduce the number of
reverse transcriptase protein sequences that were used
for the multiple alignment, we clustered the sequences
with cdhit (60% identity cutoff) and Transclust [37]. Only
one cluster contained P. pacificus HGT candidates and
other reverse transcriptases. We then used muscle (version 3.8.31, [38]) to align sequences and the phangorn R
package [39] to estimate a maximum-likelihood tree
under the LG amino acid substitution model [40] with
the Gamma + I model to account for rate variation across
sites [41]. For Diapausins we scanned the whole UniRef90 database for Diapausin domains (six PF08036.4

Page 10 of 11

hits with e-value <10-3). This set was extended by six P.
pacificus Diapausins and subsequently used for alignment
and maximum-likelihood tree estimation.
