Abstract
Background: According to Office International Des Epizooties (OIE) Bulletin, the PanAsia strain of Foot-and-Mouth
Disease Virus (FMDV) was invaded into the People’s Republic of China in May 1999. It was confirmed that the
outbreaks occurred in Tibet, Hainan and Fujian provinces. In total, 1280 susceptible animals (68 cattle, 1212 swine)
were destroyed for the epidemic control.
To investigate the distinct biological properties, we performed plaque assay, estimated the pathogenicity in suckling mice and determined the complete genomic sequence of FMDV swine-isolated O/Fujian/CHA/5/99 strain. In
addition, a molecular modeling was carried out with the external capsid proteins.
Results: The pathogenicity study showed that O/Fujian/CHA/5/99 had high virulence with respect to infection in
3-day-old suckling-mice (LD50 = 10-8.3), compared to O/Tibet/CHA/1/99 (LD50 = 10-7.0) which isolated from bovine.
The plaque assay was distinguishable between O/Fujian/CHA/5/99 and O/Tibet/CHA/1/99 by their plaque
phenotypes. O/Fujian/CHA/5/99 formed large plaque while O/Tibet/CHA/1/99 formed small plaque.
The 8,172 nucleotides (nt) of O/Fujian/CHA/5/99 was sequenced, and a phylogenetic tree was generated from the
complete nucleotide sequences of VP1 compared with other FMDV reference strains. The identity data showed
that O/Fujian/CHA/5/99 is closely related to O/AS/SKR/2002 (94.1% similarity). Based on multiple sequence alignments, comparison of sequences showed that the characteristic nucleotide/amino acid mutations were found in
the whole genome of O/Fujian/CHA/5/99.
Conclusion: Our finding suggested that C275T substitution in IRES of O/Fujian/CHA/5/99 may induce the stability
of domain 3 for the whole element function. The structure prediction indicated that most of 14 amino acid
substitutions are fixed in the capsid of O/Fujian/CHA/5/99 around B-C loop and E-F loop of VP2 (antigenic site 2),
and G-H loop of VP1 (antigenic site 1), respectively. These results implicated that these substitutions close to
heparin binding sites (E136G in VP2, A174 S in VP3) and at antigenic site 1 (T142A, A152T and Q153P in VP1) may
influence plaque size and the pathogenicity to suckling mice.
The potential of genetic characterization would be useful for microevolution and viral pathogenesis of FMDV in the
further study.

Background
Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is an acute, highly contagious viral disease of cloven-hoofed animals, mostly cattle, swine, sheep and goats, leading to severe economic
losses due to reduction in livestock production and
restriction of trade on animals and animal products. The
etiological agent, foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV),
belongs to the genus Aphthovirus of the Picornaviridae
family. Seven distinct serotypes of FMDV (O, A, C, Asia1
and SAT1-3), with numerous subtypes in each serotype,
are not distributed equally around the world [1-3].
The genome of FMDV is composed of a positivesense, single-stranded RNA that is approximately 8,200
nucleotides (nt) in length. The viral RNA contains 5’untranslated region (5’-UTR), a single long open reading
frame (ORF), and 3’-untranslated region (3’-UTR), followed by a poly(A) tail at its 3’ end [4]. There is a small
viral protein, VPg (3B), covalently linked to the 5’ end
of the genomic RNA [5]. The viral ORF encodes a single
polyprotein, which is subsequently cleaved into multiple
mature proteins (Lab/Lb; VP4, VP2, VP3, and VP1; 2A,
2B, 2C, 3A, 3B1-3, 3C, and 3D) by viral proteases (Lpro,
2A, and 3Cpro) [6,7]. The viral capsid comprised of 60
copies of the four structural proteins termed VP4 (internal), VP2, VP3 and VP1, surrounds the RNA. The 5’UTR, consists of the S-fragment, poly(C) tract, 2-4 pseudoknots (PKs), a cis-acting replication element (cre), and
an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). This region is
predicted to display complex secondary structures, and
contains several genetic elements necessary to control
essential function in viral replication and gene expression [8]. The 3’-UTR, a region of about 90 nt of heterogeneous sequence, is a highly ordered structure, and
stimulate the cap-independent translation and likely
affect other aspects of viral infection cycle [9,10].
During 1997-2002, outbreaks of FMD caused by
FMDV serotype O, occurred in the countries and districts of East Asia (EA) and the Far East [11]. The O/
YUN/TAW/97 strain, a member of the Cathay topotype,
containing the deletion of codons 93 to 102 in 3A coding region, is associated with the porcinophilic properties that caused a catastrophic outbreak of FMD in
Taiwan [12-14]. The O/AS/SKR/2002 strain, a member
of the PanAsia lineages, contains an intact 3A coding
region of the virus that developed typical lesions of
FMD with highly virulent and contagious in pigs but
very limited in cattle [15]. In addition, pigs infected
experimentally with another PanAsia strain of FMDV
(O/JPN/2000) showed typically clinical signs of FMD,
but the disease in Japanese black cattle was atypical, no
clinical signs in an infection of Holstein cattle, and
sheep and goats were not susceptible [16]. Comparison
of amino acid sequence of structural proteins of two

Page 2 of 11

different plaque phenotypes in O/JPN/2000 strain,
revealed that two substitutions existed in VP2 (133rd)
and VP3 (56th) [17,18]. These substitutions may influence heparin-binding feature and in the attenuation of
this virus in the natural host. Unfortunately, these two
mutations close to heparin interacting regions cannot
account for the characteristics of the PanAsia strains
isolated from China (as detailed in Results &
Discussion).
Here, we first report the cell-adapted PanAsia strain
(O/Fujian/CHA/5/99) of FMDV isolated from swine in
Fujian province of China in 1999, perform plaque assay
and estimate the pathogenicity in suckling mice, determine the complete genomic sequence for comparison
with O/YUN/TAW/97 and 14 reference strains of
PanAsia lineages. Furthermore, we model the three
dimensional structure of the predominant conformation
in the surface FMDV capsid proteins to mimic the probable altered receptor-ligand interactions, triggered by
substitutions of residues in VP1, VP2 and VP3.

Results
Comparison of plaque phenotypes and infectivity of O/
Fujian/CHA/5/99, and O/Tibet/CHA/1/99 strain

FMDV O/Fujian/CHA/5/99 strain of the 6th passage
producing obvious cytopathic effect (CPE) was adapted
to BHK-21 cells, and formed clear large plaque. However, the FMDV bovine-isolated O/Tibet/CHA/1/99
strain formed small plaque shaped a fringe of snowflakes
(Fig. 1). The virus titres of O/Fujian/CHA/5/99 (1.5 ×
107 PFU/ml) was no significant different from O/Tibet/
CHA/1/99 (2.0 × 107 PFU/ml). However, the pathogenicity in suckling mice of O/Fujian/CHA/5/99 was distinguishable from that estimated with O/Tibet/CHA/1/99.
The LD50 value was 10-8.3 for O/Fujian/CHA/5/99 compared to 10-7.0 for O/Tibet/CHA/1/99.
The complete genomic sequence of O/Fujian/CHA/5/99
strain

The genome sequence of the O/Fujian/CHA/5/99 strain
is 8,172 nt (excluding the poly(C) tract and the poly(A)
tail) in length including a 1,081-nt 5’-UTR which is
divided into S (366 nt), PKs (219 nt), cre (54 nt), and
IRES (442 nt), a 6,999-nt ORF that encodes 2,332 amino
acids terminating at a “TAA” stop codon, and a 92-nt
3’-UTR. All sequences were unique and comprised the
complete genome, excluding 36 primer orderly determined nucleotides [22 nt (S+ primer) at the 5’ end of
the viral genome, 7 and 8 nt (Pan/S-, Pan/I+ primers)
on either side of the poly(C) tract] (Table 1). The fulllength genomic sequence of FMDV O/Tibet/CHA/1/99
strain has been determined and submitted to GenBank
(accession NO, AF506822) by Zhang et al (2003) [19].

Figure 1 Plaque phenotypes of FMDV O/Fujian/CHA/5/99 and O/Tibet/CHA/1/99 fixed with cold acetone/methanol and stained with
0.2% crystal violet 48 h post-incubation on BHK-21 cells. O/Fujian/CHA/5/99 formed clear, large plaque (A), while O/Tibet/CHA/1/99 formed
small plaque, shaped a fringe of snowflakes (B).

Nucleotide sequence alignments and amino acids
comparison

A detailed examination of the mutations in the whole
genome of the O/Fujian/CHA/5/99 strain was based on
multiple sequence alignments (Table 2). The S-fragment
is 366 nucleotides in length at the 5’ terminus of the
viral genome, which is predicted to form a large hairpin
structure. Nucleotide transitions and deletions were
found at positions T82C, T84C, C105T, C119T, T138C,
A139G, T145C, T147C, C155T, C160T, C182T (peakloop), T222C, C238T, C280T, T288C, T327C, C345T,
and T199, A200 in O/Fujian/CHA/5/99, which compared to reference strains of PanAsia lineage. Downstream of the poly(C) tract, there is a stretch sequence
of highly tolerant to changes, containing four PKs in
structure of O/Fujian/CHA/5/99 (positions -1 to +218)
for the maintenance of biological function. Substitutions

were observed at positions T26C, A52T and T114C;
A51G, C121T (including O/AS/SKR/2002); T132C and
T193C (including O/JPN/2000) in O/Fujian/CHA/5/99.
Notably, a 43-nt deletion started at postion 53 downstream of the poly(C) tract in O/YUN/TAW/97 strain
was determined [20], resulting in the pseudoknot 2 deletion. The conserved AAACA sequence in cre is required
for viral RNA genome replication, while A30G, T33C
distinctively located at this hairpin loop of O/Fujian/
CHA/5/99 and O/AS/SKR/2002. The IRES element consists of a five structural domains, where several conserved motifs were identified [8]. In addition, the
formation of a helical structure around positions 67 (G)
and 275 (C) located at the base of domain 3 is needed
for efficient internal initial of FMDV RNA translation
[21]. Here, the substitution of C275T in O/YUN/TAW/
97, O/AS/SKR/2002 and O/Fujian/CHA/5/99 strains,

[a] The number gives the nucleotide position independently for each element of untranslated region (5’-UTR and 3’-UTR), according to FMDV O/Tibet/CHA/1/99
strain (accession NO, AF506822). The first letter corresponds to the nucleotide found in O/Tibet/CHA/1/99; -, nucleotide deletion.
[b] Single letter amino acid code is used. Position of amino acid residues is independently numbered for each protein from the amino terminus to the carboxyl
terminus.
[c] Secondary structure assignments are as described previously [8,14,27,48,52,53].

may induce a reorganization of the whole element with
important consequences for IRES function in cattle?
The other variations were present at positions T55C
(domain 2), C228T (domain 3), T312C and C389T
(domain 4), T423C, C436T, T437C, and A428C, 442A
in O/Fujian/CHA/5/99.
The leader (L) protein, a member of the papain-like
cysteine proteinase, is located at 5’ end of the ORF and
contains two in-frame initiation codons (84 nt in distance, Lab/Lb), that cleaves itself from the viral polyprotein [22] acting as a trans-proteinase and initiation
factor eIF4G at G479/R480 resulting the shut-off of host
protein synthesis [23]. 51 D, 148 H and 164 D were the
active site residues, by playing a essential role in substrate binding [24,25]. It’s also an important determinant
of virulence in animals [26]. The amino acid sequence
identities of O/Fujian/CHA/5/99 with reference PanAsia
strains and O/YUN/TAW/97 was 92.0%-94.5% and
88.1%, respectively. The variable substitutions appeared
in three distinct regions (A25T, Q26R at N-terminus;
T55A, F68L, Y73 S, P75 H and D81 S on the C-terminal
side of 51C; K144Q and Q146 H on the N-terminal side
of 148H). VP4 is the most conserved FMDV protein.
There was 100% homology in amino acid sequence
between O/Fujian/CHA/5/99 and reference PanAsia
strains. The amino acid sequence alignments of VP2
and VP3 showed that the specific substitutions of O/
Fujian/CHA/5/99 existed at the residues E136G, K175R
and F214L in VP2, and A174 S in VP3, respectively
(Table 2). The 136th in VP2 and 174th of VP3 are very
close to their respective heparin interacting regions
(residues 134th, 135th in VP2, and 173rd in VP3,
respectively). A phylogenetic tree was generated from
VP1 nucleotide sequence alignment of 16 FMDV which
caused outbreaks of FMD in EA and the Far East in
1997-2002 (Fig. 2). The identity data of VP1 showed
that the O/Fujian/CHA/5/99 strain is clustered in the
PanAsia lineage and closely related to O/AS/SKR/2002
(94.1% similarity). Furthermore, comparison of the
amino acid sequences in VP1 of O/Fujian/CHA/5/99
and O/Tibet/CHA/1/99 indicated that 9 substitutions
were found at residues Y72C, T96A, G137 D, T142A,
A152T, Q153P, I168V, A199T and L212 S of O/Tibet/

CHA/5/99 (Table 2). Most of these substitutions were
present in C-terminal segment of VP1, in particular in
G-H loop (antigenic site 1). The important integrinbinding RGD motif (145-147 residues), RGD+1, RGD+2
and RGD+4 were conserved for virus reception and
pathogenesis in these FMDV strains (Fig. 2).
In non-structural protein regions, we also found the
highest degree of sequence conservation in 2A, 2B, 2C,
3B, 3C and 3 D that it was predicted probably due to
their functions or interaction with host factors. The
characteristic amino acid mutations occurred at residues
S5A, K48R in 2B; K64E, V92A, I241T, S312N in 2C;
K18R in 3B1; R196K in 3C; and H27Y, K42Q, G62E,
N63 D, T98I, Q210R, R234K and R440W in 3 D of O/
Fujian/CHA/5/99, respectively (Table 2). Comparison of
3A protein sequences showed that O/Fujian/CHA/5/99
contains a full-length 3A coding region, whereas the 93102 amino acid deletions harbored in 3A of O/YUN/
TAW/97 (Fig. 3). I72 M was present in transmembrane
domain (positions 60-76) as previously described [14].
The other 14 amino acid substitutions were identified at
positions I3V; H31C and I34V; I42V and E57D; M85T,
A89V and N91D; I94T and T100A; E108G, N112 S,
K144E and E148G in O/Fujian/CHA/5/99 (Table 2),
which predicted to undergo positive selection of viral
evolution. These data suggested that the variability of
3A may be highly informative for molecular epidemiological studies.
The 3’-UTR of O/Fujian/CHA/5/99, a region of 92 nt
with high tolerant changes (72.8%-95.7% similarity) following the ORF termination codon, contains a “Y”
shape of RNA which is required for its function, where
the nucleotide changes of C32T and A91G were
observed (Table 2).
Molecular modeling

We have identified that O/Fujian/CHA/5/99 and O/
Tibet/CHA/1/99 were differed in the amino acid
sequence of VP2, VP3 and VP1 (Table 2). By using the
atomic coordinates obtained by X-ray crystallography of
FMDV O 1 BFS, six mutations which are clustered the
position occupied by the G-H loop of VP1 fixed in the
capsid of O/Fujian/CHA/5/99 were determined (K175R

Fujian/CHA/5/99) (A). The 93-102 amino acid deletions harbored in 3A of the porcinophilic phenotype of O/YUN/TAW/97 (B). The highly variable
C-terminus was predicted probably due to the conformation of three-dimensional structure for 3A function (C).

in VP2, A174 S in VP3, G137 D, T142A, A152T and
Q153P in VP1). E136G substitution in VP2 was measured close to antigenic site 2 within E-F loop; Y72C,
T96A and A199T substitutions in VP1 are located at
bD-strand, E-F loop and antigenic site 1 of C-terminus,
respectively. In addition, G72 within B-C loop (antigenic
site 2) of VP2 is fixed in O/Tibet/CHA/1/99, and I168
of VP1 mapped in H-I loop (Fig. 4). As stated previously
[18,27,28], these substitutions around heparin binding
sites and antigenic site 1 on the viral capsid may influence plaque size and the pathogenicity to suckling mice.

Discussion
The PanAsia strain of FMDV serotype O originated in
India no later than 1982 [29]. It has been the most
dominant outbreak strain in the recent years and distributed around the world in over 24 countries [30].
Towards the west, the virus spread into Saudi Aribia
(1994), then emerged as the pandemic virus circulating
in Middle East, Middle East-South Asia region and into
European countries such as Turkey, Greece and Bulgaria
(1996) [3,11,31]. Furthermore, the virus strain even
invaded into South Africa (2000) [32]. A catastrophic
outbreak caused by the same viral lineage occurred in
the United Kingdom in 2001, and subsequently spread
into Ireland, France and the Netherlands within 1
mouth [3,32]. Towards the east, the virus spread into
Nepal (1993), Bangladesh (1996), Bhutan (1998), China
(1999), Japan (2000), Korea (2000) and finally invaded

Page 7 of 11

countries of the Far East such as Mongolia (2000) and
Russia (2000) [3,11,33].
The extent to the genetic diversity of these PanAsia
virus isolates accumulating over the course of FMD outbreaks with infection of susceptible animals, is contributed to the understanding of the occurrence of phenotypic
changes in cultured cells and alteration in host tropism.
Here, a gradual accumulation of nucleotide/amino acid
mutations were observed in O/Fujian/CHA/5/99 evolving
in FMDV populations. The radical ambiguities of convergent evolution will potentially affect the functional and/
or structural features involved in 5’-UTR and 3’-UTR of
FMDV, respectively. The S-fragment located at the 5’ terminus of the FMDV genome may play a role in the
switch from translation to replication [34]. The variable
nature of PKs was documented that it can be used along
with the 3A-based phylogenetic tree for genetic analysis
of FMDVs (data not shown). Mutations in the AAACA
motif and the stem region of the cre element significantly
reduced replication of FMDV genome [35], suggesting
that two substitutions (positions 30th, 33rd) located at
the loop within this structure of O/Fujian/CHA/5/99
may induce decreasing for RNA replication in vivo. Deletion, insertion and substitutions (the majority of which
were transitions) probably lead to changes in the organization of the IRES structure, resulting in modulated its
activity for internal initiation of translation [8]. The
structure of 3’-UTR could affect the infectivity of FMDV
due to RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions [8].

Figure 4 Locations of 14 amino acid differences (L212 S not shown) mapped in the surface capsid proteins of FMDV O/Fujian/CHA/5/
99 (A) and O/Tibet/CHA/1/99 (B). The potential critical amino acid residues were measured at positions 136 in VP2; 174 in VP3; 142, 152, 153
in VP1, which are represented as globe in VP2 (blue), VP3 (green) and VP1 (yellow), respectively.

In the present study, George et al. (2001) [36] has discussed that few unusual variations in the L protein may
reflect its role in either RNA-RNA or RNA-protein
interactions that specifically enhanced IRES-dependent
translation. By sequencing the structural proteins of O/
Fujian/CHA/5/99, we have provided the first homology
analysis of the plaque-purified PanAsia strain of FMDV
isolated from swine in China. In spite of the evidence
generated from O/JPN/2000 [18] and studies determined by Sa-carvalho et al. (1997) [37], our analysis of
O/Fujian/CHA/5/99 and 9 reference strains of FMDV
indicated that all of these viruses display 133 D in VP2
(excluding D133 S in VP2 of O/YUN/TAW/97) and 56
H in VP3. Chinese Yellow cattle and native cattle
infected experimentally with the FMDV O/Taiwan/99
strain showed no clinical signs. However, pigs infected
with O/Taiwan/99 developed typical disease [33]. In
Korea, the isolated virus (O/SKR/2000) infected Holstein
cattle caused typical vesicles in the field, but did not
develop typical vesicular lesions on the foot in animal
experiments (OIE, 2000). The 174th amino acid in VP3
substitution was presumably provided as a practical
explanation for attenuated virulence of these viruses in
cattle (Table 2). Meanwhile, Y79 H (O/JPN/2000 and
O/YUN/TAW/97), E136G (O/AS/SKR/2002 and O/
Fujian/CHA/5/99) and F214L (O/YUN/TAW/97, O/AS/
SKR/2002 and O/Fujian/CHA/5/99) in VP2, T56I (O/
YUN/TAW/97 and O/AS/SKR/2002), N85 D (O/YUN/
TAW/97), T96A (O/AS/SKR/2002 and O/Fujian/CHA/
5/99), T142N/A (O/YUN/TAW/97 and O/Fujian/CHA/
5/99, respectively) and A152T (O/AS/SKR/2002 and O/
Fujian/CHA/5/99) in VP1 may be associated with bovine
attenuation of these viruses. Y79 H within bC strand
and E136G within E-F loop of VP2, T142N/A and
A152T within G-H loop of VP1 are exposed on the surface of the viral capsid. The direct induction of capsid
alterations in the cell attachment sites may influence
virus interaction with cellular receptor for FMDV adaptation to cells in culture and mild pathogenicity [38,39].
The degree of conservation was somewhat higher for
2A, 2B, 2C, 3B1-3 and 3C, and the impact of adaptive
positive selection at the amino acid level on these nonstructural proteins has been found by identified genome
regions of 10 FMDV isolates involved in genetic diversity. To date, these included N1 S (O/JPN/2000), D3N
(O/TAW/2/99) and S13P (O/AS/SKR/2002) in 2A; I18V
(O/YUN/TAW/97 and O/AS/SKR/2002) in 2B; Q164 H
(O/AS/SKR/2002) and I241T (O/Fujian/CHA/5/99) in
2C (nearly the conserved motifs D 160 DLG 163 and
N243KLD246, respectively); K18E (O/JPN/2000) in 3B1
and V17A (O/YUN/TAW/97 and O/AS/SKR/2002) in
3B2. 3A contains residues predicted to undergo positive
selection with respect to infection in guinea pigs [40].
Deletions in 3A have been associated with altered host

Page 8 of 11

range in the hepatoviruses [41], rhinoviruses [42], enteroviruses [43], and aphthoviruses [12-14,44]. This deletion cannot be found in the 3A region of O/Fujian/
CHA/5/99, which has high similarity with the other
PanAsia strains (91.7%-92.6% in nucleotide sequences
and 86.9%-89.5% in amino acid sequences, respectively).
I61V and I76L (O/YUN/TAW/97), L69 M (O/AS/SKR/
2002) and I72 M (O/Fujian/CHA/5/99) in transmembrane domain were observed (Fig. 3). The highly variable C-terminal half (positions 117 to 143) in the 3A
coding region of O/YUN/TAW/97, form a short a-helix
(Zhang et al., unpublished data, 2007). A previously
described FMDV mutant 3Dpol with amino acid replacement D338A in the NTP-binding domain (the peptide
motif Y336GDD339) destroyed the viral polymerase activity [45] suggesting that although 3Dpol is more tolerate
of substitutions at most positions, conservation of the
tertiary structure is likely to be necessary for its function. These observations implied that dramatic alteration
in these regions contributed to properties of these proteins and the fitness of dynamic mutant distributions,
though the pathogenicity of O/Fujian/CHA/5/99 in cattle is not clear.
Thus, further investigations should aim to O/Fujian/
CHA/5/99 infected normal hosts in animal experiments
and the finding of molecular basis for the derivation of
genetic mutants by utilizing reverse genetics. These studies may help us to clarify how is it that the mutations
responsible for genetic diversity and antigenic drift have
a moderate effect on the interactions of FMDV to its cellular receptors and in responses to selective constraints.

Conclusion
Our studies found very different phenotypes and pathogenicities between FMDV O/Fujian/CHA/5/99 strain
and O/Tibet/CHA/1/99. The distinct biological properties are the results of error-prone replication of genome
during viral life cycles. Our findings indicate that
nucleotide and amino acid mutations were present in
the whole genome of O/Fujian/CHA/5/99, as compared
to O/Tibet/CHA/1/99. The great majority of these
mutations associated with the effect of viral fitness in
physical and biological environment. Advantageous
mutations fixed on the viral genome of O/Fujian/CHA/
5/99 may be essential contributed to FMDV adaptation
of susceptible animals in the field. Consequently, future
study can be interested in these predictions for the
understanding of viral populations, genetic variability
and its biological implications.
Methods
Cells, sample collection and virus isolation

Baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells were maintained at
37°C in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM,

Bai et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:208
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/208

Gibco) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS,
Hyclone). The sample of vesicles on hoof was collected
from swine, which showed clinical symptoms of FMD,
in Fujian province of China (OIE, May 1999). The
grinding suspension (1/10, w/v) was prepared in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing the antibiotics
penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml),
overnight at 4°C, clarified by centrifugation at 2,000 × g
for 10 min, sterilized by using 0.45 μm filter unit (Millipore), and the virus was propagated on BHK-21 cells as
described previously [46]. The isolated virus adapted to
BHK-21 cells was designated O/Fujian/CHA/5/99 strain.
The FMDV O/Tibet/CHA/1/99 strain isolated from
bovine in Tibet of China was used in this work and conserved in national foot-and-mouth disease reference
laboratory.
Plaque assay and the pathogenicity in suckling-mice

Confluent BHK-21 cell cultures in 6-well plates were
prepared for plaque-forming assay. The serial 10-fold
dilutions of viruses were inoculated 200 μl per well.
After 1 h of incubation at 37°C in 5% CO2, 2 ml overlay
medium containing 0.6% Gum and 1% FBS was added
and cultured for 48 h under the same conditions. Subsequently, the BHK-21 cells were washed three times with
PBS (pH 7.5), then fixed with cold acetone/methanol for
20 min at -20°C, and stained with 0.2% crystal violet for
30 min at room temperature. Finally, we were able to
observe plaque morphology and calculate virus titres by
plaque-forming units (PFU) from the infected BHK-21
cell cultures.
Serial ten-fold diluted viruses were prepared in DMEM
containing 2% FBS, and the pathogenicities were titrated
by intraperitoneal inoculation of 3-day-old suckling-mice
in groups of five animals each with 0.2 ml of virus dilutions. The suckling mice were observed for 72 h after
infection and the 50% lethal dose (LD50) was determined
by the method of Reed and Muench (1938) [47].
Sequencing and genetic characterization

Rneasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) RNA extraction was performed as the manufacture’s protocol. 4 μl 5 × AMV
buffer, 4 μl 10 mM dNTP, 10 μl RNA, 1 μl 50 pmol/L
anti-sense genome specific primers (Pan/S-, L3, NK61,
P222, Pan/205, and Dnn-, respectively; Table 1), 1 μl
AMV (TaKaRa) mix was incubated at 42°C for 1 h and
then on ice for 3 min. After completion of the reverse
transcript (RT) reaction, six overlapping PCR fragments
covering the viral genome were amplified from each
sample by using specific primer sets (set 1, S+ and Pan/
S-; set 2, Pan/I+ and L3; set 3, Pan/204 and NK61; set
4, P211 and P222; set 5, Pan/201 and Pan/205; set 6, D3
+ and Dnn-; Table 1) with LA Taq DNA polymerase
(TaKaRa). The target PCR products were cleaned up

Page 9 of 11

using Wizard® Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega)
and cloned into pGEM®-T Vector (Promega). Cycle
sequencing reaction were performed with fluorescent
BigDye chain terminators (Applied Biosystems), followed
by resolution on an ABI Prism 310 genetic analyzer
(Applied Biosystems).
The complete genetic sequences were assembled using
SeqMan (DNAStar). Multiple sequence alignment was
analyzed using MegAlign (DNAStar) to construct a phylogenetic tree. MegAlign was also used for the genomic
analysis of nucleotide mutations in 5′-UTR and 3′-UTR,
and amino acid substitutions in leader (L) protein, structural proteins and non-structural proteins. The atomic
coordinates of FMDV crystallized for O 1 BFS [48-51]
were used to model the conformations, and the structures of FMDV O/Tibet/CHA/1/99 and O/Fujian/CHA/
5/99 strains were optimized by placing substituted
amino acids which exist in the external surface of capsid, in their standard conformations.
