Abstract
Early diagnosis of dengue virus (DENV) infection is important for patient management and control of dengue outbreaks. The objective of this study was to analyze the usefulness of urine and saliva samples for early diagnosis of
DENV infection by real time RT-PCR. Two febrile patients, who have been attended at the General Hospital of the
School of Medicine of Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo University were included in the study. Serum, urine and saliva samples collected from both patients were subjected to real time RT-PCR for DENV detection and quantification. Dengue RNA was detected in serum, urine and saliva samples of both patients. Patient 1 was infected with DENV-2
and patient 2 with DENV-3. Data presented in this study suggest that urine and saliva could be used as alternative
samples for early diagnosis of dengue virus infection when blood samples are difficult to obtain, e.g., in newborns
and patients with hemorrhagic syndromes.
Finding
Infection with any of the four dengue virus serotypes
can lead to a broad clinical spectrum, ranging from subclinical infection or an influenza-like disease known as
dengue fever (DF) to a severe, sometimes fatal, disease
characterized by hemorrhage and plasma leakage that
can lead to shock, known as dengue hemorrhagic fever/
dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS)[1,2]. Laboratory
diagnosis of DENV infection is based on virus isolation,
detection of virus antigen or RNA and detection of
DENV specific antibodies in serum or plasma [3]. Realtime reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) has been developed to detect DENV RNA in
human samples [4-7]. This technique is an important
tool for the rapid diagnosis of DENV infection allowing
early initiation of patient management and specific preventive health measures. The objective of this study was
to analyze the usefulness of urine and saliva samples for
early diagnosis of DENV infection by real time RT-PCR.
The Hospital Ethics Committee of the School of Medicine of Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo University has
approved this study (Proc. 4921/2007).

Two febrile patients attended at the General Hospital
of the School of Medicine of Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo
University, were included in the study. Both patients
were female, 30 (patient 1) and 13 (patient 2) years old,
and presented symptoms suggestive of DF with high
fever, frontal headache, arthralgia, myalgia and retroocular pain. The patients received supportive treatment
including bedrest, antipyretics, analgesics and oral fluid
replacement, and had a good outcome without any complication. Serum, urine and saliva samples were collected, two and nine days after the onset of symptoms,
from both patients, and subjected to a quantitative real
time RT-PCR for dengue as described earlier [7]. Dengue RNA was detected in all clinical samples collected
two days after the onset of symptoms from both febrile
patients (Table 1). Serum showed a viral load higher
than urine and saliva samples. To identify the virus serotype, the entire E protein gene was amplified from the
sera and subjected directly to DNA sequencing for phylogenetic analysis as previously mentioned [8]. This analysis showed that patient 1 was infected with dengue
virus type 2 and patient 2 with dengue virus type 3
(Figure 1). The clinical samples were also subjected to a
capture ELISA for dengue-specific IgM/IgG as previously mentioned [7]. Both patients presented seroconversion indicating a primary infection (Table 1). For
virus isolation, 20 μl of each clinical sample were added

isolated in this study with 72 global samples of DENV. Tamura and Nei (TrN+I+G) nucleotide substitution model was used with a
proportion of invariable sites (I) of 0.2096 and gamma distribution (G) of 0.6072 using the hierarchical likelihood ratio test (hLTR). The YF17D
(9627244) was used as outgroup. Horizontal branch lengths are drawn to scale. Viruses isolated from patients 1 and 2 are underlined. GenBank
accession numbers are indicated in parenthesis.

to a 25 cm2 flask containing a monolayer of C6/36 cells
and seven days after inoculation, the supernatant was
subjected to the real time RT-PCR to confirm virus isolation. Dengue virus was isolated from the serum samples collected two days after the onset of symptoms
from both patients (Table 1). In order to avoid any kind
of contamination, all procedures of virus isolation, RNA
purification, protein E gene amplification, PCR product
analysis and DNA sequencing were performed in different rooms following good laboratory practice guidelines.
In addition to serum, we were able to detect dengue
virus in both urine and saliva samples by real time RTPCR. In a previous case report study, dengue virus was
detected in urine and saliva samples up to 14 days after
the onset of fever, when no viremia was detected, suggesting that the virus could remain in urine and saliva
for a longer period of time than in serum [9]. However,
in our study, dengue virus was detected in serum, urine
and saliva samples of both patients, two days after the
onset of symptoms, but not after nine days. The lower
viral load found in urine and saliva compared to serum
suggests that dengue virus would be detected in these
clinical samples for a shorter period of time.
Recently, the usefulness of saliva in dengue serologic
diagnosis has been studied showing that specific IgM
could be detected in patients with primary infection and
IgM/IgG in patients with secondary infection [10]. We
were able to detect IgM and IgG in the two patients
with a primary infection.
Our results suggest that urine and saliva samples
could be used for dengue diagnosis in cases where
blood samples are difficult to obtain, such as in newborns or in patients with hemorrhagic syndromes. Urine
and saliva samples are easy to collect without invasive
procedures and urine samples can be collected in large
volumes. However, further studies, with a higher number of patients, are needed to confirm these results.
