Abstract
Background: Although capable to evolve, viruses are generally considered non-living entities
because they are acellular and devoid of metabolism. However, the recent publication of the
genome sequence of the Mimivirus, a giant virus that parasitises amoebas, strengthened the idea
that viruses should be included in the tree of life. In fact, the first phylogenetic analyses of a few
Mimivirus genes that are also present in cellular lineages suggested that it could define an
independent branch in the tree of life in addition to the three domains, Bacteria, Archaea and
Eucarya.
Results: We tested this hypothesis by carrying out detailed phylogenetic analyses for all the
conserved Mimivirus genes that have homologues in cellular organisms. We found no evidence
supporting Mimivirus as a new branch in the tree of life. On the contrary, our phylogenetic trees
strongly suggest that Mimivirus acquired most of these genes by horizontal gene transfer (HGT)
either from its amoebal hosts or from bacteria that parasitise the same hosts. The detection of
HGT events involving different eukaryotic donors suggests that the spectrum of hosts of Mimivirus
may be larger than currently known.
Conclusion: The large number of genes acquired by Mimivirus from eukaryotic and bacterial
sources suggests that HGT has been an important process in the evolution of its genome and the
adaptation to parasitism.

Background
Since their discovery in the last years of the XIX century up
to our days, viruses have never ceased to puzzle biologists,
especially those studying their evolution. Because of their
nature as entities at the border between the living and the
non-living, their origin has been the matter of passionate
debate. Opinions range between the two extreme "virusearly" and "virus-late" hypotheses. The first postulates
that viruses originated before modern cells [1-5]. On the
contrary, the second hypothesis proposes that viruses

originated either by the escape of genetic material and
proteins from cells, or by a dramatic reductive evolution
from cellular forms that lost all the "cellular paraphernalia" unnecessary for the parasitic lifestyle [6-8]. As a consequence, the position of viruses within the tree of life is
also a subject of disagreement. Whereas some scientists
fervently advocate that viruses should have a place in the
tree of life [9], many other consider that, being acellular
and lacking any kind of carbon and energy metabolism,
viruses cannot be properly compared with true living

beings (i.e. cellular) and, therefore, do not belong to the
tree of life [7,10]. Moreover, there is compelling evidence
for the polyphyletic origin of viruses, which further complicates the issue [11].
These debates have recently gained an unprecedented
impetus when Raoult and co-workers published the
description of the genome of Mimivirus, a giant virus first
detected as a parasite of amoeba of the genus Acanthamoeba, which is endowed with the biggest viral genome
known to date: 1.2 Mbp containing 911 genes [12]. A
number of genomic signatures strongly support that Mimivirus belongs to the NCLDV (Nucleo-Cytoplasmic Large
ds-DNA Virus) virus family. The mimiviral genome contains genes frequently found in viruses, as those involved
in genome replication, but also, and for the first time in a
virus, a number of genes coding for proteins involved in
transcription and translation. Therefore, at least from the
point of view of gene content, Mimivirus appears somehow closer to a typical cell than any other described virus.
Moreover, Raoult et al. identified seven mimiviral proteins that have closely related eukaryotic homologues.
Their phylogenetic analysis in a multi-protein concatenation supported the emergence of Mimivirus as a sistergroup of eukaryotes in a tree including representatives
from the three domains of life [12]. Therefore, it was
hypothesised that this virus would define a new branch
distinct from the three domains of life: Bacteria, Archaea
and Eukaryotes [12]. Such an unexpected result had the
potential to revolutionise our conceptions on the diversity
and evolution of life, up to now based on the tripartite
scheme of the three domains [13]. Raoult et al. further
suggested that the NCLDV family may have played a role
in the origin of eukaryotes [12]. This would agree with
previous hypotheses stating that viruses could be at the
origin of many eukaryotic genes [3,14] or even the eukaryotic nucleus [15,16].
The study of viral evolution using phylogenetic analysis is
most often a difficult task due to several peculiarities of
viruses related to their parasitic lifestyle, such as rapid evolutionary rates and the propensity to be involved in horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events [17]. As recently shown
[18], the emergence of Mimivirus at the base of the
eukaryotic branch in the seven-protein study by Raoult et
al. was the result of an accumulation of artefacts due to the
simultaneous analysis of several markers that had been
profusely exchanged between distant species by HGT [18].
That was the case for two aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases:
methyonyl-tRNA (Met-RS) and tyrosyl-tRNA (Tyr-RS)
synthetases, which are known to have been intensely
affected by HGT [19]. For example, the proteobacterium
Escherichia coli has a Met-RS of archaeal origin and a TyrRS transferred from Gram-positive Firmicutes [18,19].
Therefore, a single species can have aminoacyl-tRNA syn-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/12

thetases with at least two very different evolutionary histories and, consequently, their simultaneous analysis in a
multi-protein concatenation will inevitably lead to a
wrong phylogenetic tree, especially when a restricted taxonomic sampling is used (i.e., a very small number of species).
When coping with datasets affected by HGT, the most reliable way to avoid artefacts is to carry out independent
analyses for each marker. In fact, when independent phylogenetic trees of the proteins used by Raoult et al. were
carried out with a rich taxonomic sampling, the results
were completely different [18]. Not only HGT events were
detected, but Mimivirus did no longer form an independent branch at the base of the eukaryotes, but emerged well
nested within them. Moreover, for certain markers such as
the Tyr-RS, it branched as a close relative of several species
of amoeba [18]. This result showed that, instead of being
the ancestral source of eukaryotic genes, Mimivirus has
incorporated these genes from its eukaryotic host, the
amoeba, into its own genome. While these studies were
based on only a handful of genes, we sought here to
understand how extensive was the role of HGT in shaping
the whole Mimivirus genome, and which were the sources
of the transferred genes. These questions were recently
addressed using surrogate methods, those that do not
require inference of phylogenetic trees, such as the analysis of BLAST scores. Using this approach, Ogata et al. [20]
studied the distribution of BLAST scores for 87 Mimivirus
ORFs, searched against a database containing homologous sequences from the amoeba Entamoeba histolytica,
metazoa, fungi and plants. Their analysis showed that
only five Mimivirus ORFs (MIMI_L124, MIMI_L469,
MIMI_L619, MIMI_R665, and MIMI_L780) are more similar to their E. histolytica homologues than to the
sequences from other eukaryotic groups. A similar analysis for the entire set of Mimivirus ORFs showed that about
40 of them have eukaryotic or bacterial sequences as best
matches [21-23]. However, BLAST searches, as also other
surrogate methods, offer only a very rough estimate of the
phylogenetic affinity of a gene. Indeed, very often the best
BLAST hit does not correspond to the closest evolutionary
relative. For example, a BLAST search of the ORF
MIMI_R299 (ribonucleotide reductase HI) retrieves several fungi as best hits, whereas phylogenetic analysis supports its relationship with bacterial homologues
(Supplementary Figure 28 in Additional data file 2). This
can be explained by several factors that can reduce the
accuracy of BLAST searches, in particular the heterogeneity
of evolutionary rates among species [24]. In that sense,
several studies have shown that surrogate methods are
clearly inferior to phylogenetic analysis in inferring the
evolutionary origin of genes [25,26]. In addition, phylogenetic analyses can provide a very precise identification
of the donors of genes acquired by HGT, especially in the

case of recent transfer events, and they can also provide
statistical measures of the support of the inferred phylogenetic relationships (e.g., bootstrap proportions or Bayesian posterior probabilities). Therefore, we carried out a
detailed phylogenetic analysis of all the Mimivirus
genome ORFs with well-identified cellular homologues in
order to determine whether these genes have a viral or a
cellular origin. In the latter case, phylogenetic analyses
can be helpful to identify cell-to-Mimivirus HGT events
and the corresponding gene donors.

Results and Discussion
Accurate phylogenetic reconstruction requires a correct
degree of conservation among the sequences analysed.
Therefore, we focused only on the set of 198 mimiviral
proteins ascribed to COG families [27].
Mimivirus ORF homologues have an extremely patchy
taxonomic distribution
For each protein, we retrieved by BLASTP all homologues
available in the protein non-redundant (nr) database and
studied their distribution in the three domains of life. We
considered that homologues of a mimiviral ORF are
'present' in a domain only if they are widely distributed
across different phyla of the domain or, at least, in most
species of one major phylum (e.g., Metazoa). For 72 ORFs
out of the 198 starting proteins, we did not retrieve any
clear homologue, some of these ORFs most likely corresponding to erroneous annotations (see Supplementary
table 1 in Additional data file 1). Among the remaining
126 ORFs, the most abundant class (Figure 1) was that of
ORFs present only in bacteria and eukaryotes (47 ORFs,
37,3%), followed by those present in the three domains
(29 ORFs, 23%) or only in eukaryotes (21 ORFs, 16,7%).
Smaller proportions of ORFs were found only in bacteria
and archaea (9 ORFs, 7%), bacteria (12 ORFs, 9,5%) or

archaea and eukaryotes (8 ORFs, 6,5%). A more detailed
inspection revealed that the distribution within each
domain was in certain cases very unequal. For example,
some ORFs were only found in animals (e.g., the glycosyltransferases MIMI_L230 and MIMI_R699), in bacteria and
fungi (e.g., the mannosyltransferase MIMI_L373), or in a
number of very diverse combinations of taxa (Supplementary table 1 in Additional data file 1).
Interestingly, we found that only a very small fraction of
the 198 mimiviral ORFs has homologues in other members of the NCLDV family of viruses, even in those with
relatively big genomes. For example, the phycodnaviruses
Emiliania huxleyi virus 86 (407 kbp, 478 protein coding
genes) and Paramecium bursaria Chlorella virus 1 (330 kbp,
701 genes) contain only 27 and 28 homologues of the
198 mimiviral ORFs (detected by BLASTP with an E-value
threshold of 1e-03), respectively. This represents less than
15% of these 198 ORFs, and could be partially explained
by the smaller genome size of those phycodnaviruses.
However, the values are significantly smaller than those
expected just by the difference in genome size: ~100–150
homologues should be retrieved in these phycodnaviruses. In addition, these data show a very disparate taxonomic distribution of genes among the different viruses of
the NCLDV family, a situation that is frequently a clear
symptom of HGT [28]. Moreover, our phylogenetic analyses support a viral origin for only 4 ORFs among the 198
mimiviral ORFs studied (the helicase MIMI_L206, the
NAD-dependent DNA ligase MIMI_R303, and the two
thiol-oxidoreductases MIMI_R368 and MIMI_R596,
Additional data file 2). This observation, together with the
fact that the mimiviral ORFs that have homologues in the
three domains of life are not the dominant class of ORFs
in Mimivirus (see above), is extremely difficult to reconcile with the hypothesis that NCLDV viruses may define a
fourth major lineage of life (a "fourth domain"). In fact,
genomes among the smallest ones found in archaea (e.g.
Nanoarchaeum equitans, 490 kbp [29]) and bacteria (e.g.
Mycoplasma genitalium, 580 kbp [30]), which are significantly smaller than the Mimivirus genome, share many
more genes with their archaeal and bacterial relatives than
the Mimivirus does with the other NCLDV. Moreover,
these archaeal and bacterial species with highly reduced
genomes have a much larger repertoire of typical cellular
genes than the Mimivirus [31,32].
If the "fourth domain" hypothesis [12] was correct, the
actual taxonomic distribution shown by the mimiviral
ORFs could only be explained by an extremely massive
loss of ancestral genes in the different NCLDV viruses but,
even in that case, the majority of gene phylogenies should
support a clear separation of the mimiviral sequences
from those of the other domains. On the contrary, if the
"gene acquisition by HGT" hypothesis [18] was correct,

the majority of gene phylogenies should support an emergence of the Mimivirus ORFs that have cellular homologues within one of the three domains (according to the
specific donor involved in each HGT event). We have
explored these two possibilities by detailed phylogenetic
analyses, applying Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian Inference (BI) methods, of all the 126 mimiviral
ORFs with cellular homologues and with an adequate
degree of sequence conservation.
Phylogenetic analysis: Mimiviral ORFs of prokaryotic
origin
We detected a single ORF related to archaeal homologues,
the DNA-directed RNA polymerase MIMI_R470 (Supplementary Figure 53 in Additional data file 2), and a much
larger number of ORFs related to bacterial sequences. The
six
mimiviral
ORFs
MIMI_L432,
MIMI_L153,
MIMI_R836, MIMI_R852, MIMI_R853, and MIMI_R855
are shared exclusively with bacteria (Figure 1 and Supplementary Table 1 in Additional data file 1). They likely correspond to genes that have been acquired by the virus by
HGT from bacteria. Interestingly, the three uncharacterised proteins MIMI_R852, MIMI_R853 and MIMI_R855
show very similar taxonomic distributions across bacteria
and similar phylogenies. These three mimiviral ORFs
emerge within Cyanobacteria (Supplementary Figures 94,
95 and 96 in Additional data file 2), suggesting a single
HGT from a cyanobacterial donor to the Mimivirus. In
addition to them, our phylogenetic analyses detected 23

additional genes of bacterial origin among the mimiviral
ORFs shared with bacteria and other domains (archaea
and/or eukaryotes, Supplementary Figures in Additional
data file 2). Some of these are related to homologues from
Gram positive Firmicutes: MIMI_L233 (a putative Zndependent peptidase) and MIMI_R836 (uncharacterised
bacterial protein). The others are closer to proteobacterial
sequences: e.g., ORFs MIMI_L477 (a cysteine protease),
MIMI_L498 (a Zn-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase),
and MIMI_R877 (outer membrane lipoprotein). The
source of these bacterial-related ORFs is intriguing. The
most appealing possibility is that Mimivirus has acquired
them from bacteria that co-infect its same eukaryotic
hosts. Indeed, amoebas harbour a variety of intracellular
bacteria, including Proteobacteria, Gram positives (both
Actinobacteria and Firmicutes), Chlamydiae and Bacteroidetes [33]. Our phylogenetic trees show that several
mimiviral ORFs are clearly related to the corresponding
homologues from bacterial species that are typical inhabitants of amoeba. That is the case of two of the ORFs cited
above: MIMI_L498, related to Legionella pneumophila (Figure 2A) and MIMI_R877, related to Campylobacter spp.
(Figure 2B), which are proteobacteria frequently found in
different amoebas, including Acanthamoeba [33-35]. A
recent article stresses the role that amoebas may have
played to facilitate the exchange of genes between different intracellular bacterial species, a phenomenon that
might have been important in their adaptation to life
within eukaryotic cells [36]. Our results suggest that the

situation may be even more complex, since the intracellular bacteria appear to have transferred genes also to the
mimiviral genome. Some of these genes are probably
involved in the parasitic adaptations of the Mimivirus,
such as the Campylobacter-like outer membrane lipoprotein cited above (MIMI_R877).
Mimiviral ORFs of eukaryotic origin: amoebas and
evidence for unknown hosts
Most of the 126 mimiviral ORFs that have homologues in
cellular species useful for phylogenetic analysis can be
found in eukaryotes (105 ORFs, 21 of them being absent
from prokaryotes, Figure 1). Our phylogenetic analyses
inferred a eukaryotic origin for 60 of these ORFs. Interestingly, several ORFs of eukaryotic origin are closely related
to homologues found in different amoebas, as in the case
of MIMI_L124 (tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase) already reported
[18]. We inferred a clear amoebal origin also for
MIMI_R214 (RAS family GTPase), MIMI_L254 (heat
shock protein HSP70), MIMI_L258 (thymidine kinase),
MIMI_R259 (DUF549 domain-containing protein),
MIMI_L300 (endo/excinuclease), MIMI_L394 (HD superfamily phosphohydrolase), MIMI_R405 (tRNA uracil-5methyltransferase), MIMI_L444 (ADP-ribosylglycohydrolase), MIMI_R464 (translation initiation factor SUI1),
MIMI_R528
(unknown
protein),
MIMI_R818,
MIMI_R826 and MIMI_R831 (three paralogous serine/
threonine protein kinases, Figure 3). To sum up, our trees
support that ~10% of the mimiviral ORFs with eukaryotic
homologues were acquired from amoeba. These ORFs are
involved in a variety of processes and, in some cases, their
acquisition by HGT was followed by duplication events,
such as the kinases MIMI_R818, MIMI_R826 and
MIMI_R836 (Figure 3). Certain mimiviral ORFs are exclusively shared by this virus and its amoebal hosts and they
represent probable additional host-to-virus HGT events.
This is the case of the 16 mimiviral ORFs proteins containing the FNIP motif detected by Song et al. [37]. It is important to note that all these ORFs of amoebal origin
represent a minimal number since others might also have
an amoebal origin but did not produce well resolved trees,
a problem that can be due to different causes: lack of phylogenetic signal, small number of positions useful for
phylogenetic analyses of several ORFs, tree reconstruction
artefacts due to unequal evolutionary rates among taxa,
and/or missing data concerning amoebas (for example,
there is no complete genome sequence available at
present for any Acanthamoeba species).

In addition to all the ORFs likely acquired by HGT from
the amoebal hosts, we detected a few ones that support a
close phylogenetic relationship between the Mimivirus
and eukaryotes unrelated to the Amoebozoa. The phylogenetic analysis of the two HSP70 homologues found in
Mimivirus is a remarkable example. Whereas MIMI_L254,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/12

an endoplasmic reticulum-type HSP70, is strongly related
to amoebozoan homologues, the cytosolic-type HSP70
MIMI_L393 is clearly related to species of the genera Naegleria and Sawyeria (Figure 4). These species are flagellated
amoebas, many of them parasitic, which belong to the
Heterolobosea [38,39]. This group is possibly related to
the Euglenozoa, forming a large assemblage called the
Discicristata, very distant from Amoebozoa [40,41]. The
presence of giant virus-like particles in the cytoplasm of
Naegleria fowleri was already noticed in the 1970s [42,43],
and it was recently hypothesised that these particles might
be related to Mimivirus [44]. Our detection of a mimiviral
ORF phylogenetically related to homologues from Naegleria and Sawyeria strongly supports the hypothesis that
Mimivirus can also infect these amoeboid species, even if
they are very distant from the hosts, such as Acanthamoeba
spp., known up to date.
In addition to this ORF, we detected three other ORFs
(MIMI_R141, MIMI_L605, and MIMI_L615, see Supplementary Figures 7, 70 and 73 in Additional data file 2)
that are related to homologues from different protist species belonging to the Euglenozoa, more specifically to the
Kinetoplastida, which are flagellates with both free-living
and parasitic members, such as Trypanosoma and Leishmania. Since the heterolobosean flagellate amoebas, as Naegleria, are likely related to the Euglenozoa (see above), the
possibility exists that these ORFs have also been acquired
from Naegleria relatives but that we could only detect a
phylogenetic affinity with the Kinetoplastida because the
corresponding sequences from Naegleria are not available
in current databases. That could also be the case for the
ORFs that branch as sisters of the kinetoplastid sequences:
MIMI_L605 (peptidylprolyl isomerase) and MIMI_L615
(phosphatidylinositol kinase). However, for the ORF
MIMI_R141 (dTDP-D-glucose 4,6-dehydratase), our phylogenetic analyses strongly support the emergence of
Mimivirus within the Kinetoplastida, indicating that it
acquired this ORF from a kinetoplastid species (Figure 5).
This suggests that not only protists with amoeboid cell
structures, but also typical flagellates such as the kinetoplastids may be hosts of mimiviruses. Nevertheless, we
cannot discard the possibility that HGT from these flagellates to Mimivirus occurred within amoebas since kinetoplastid parasites (such as Perkinsiella amoebae) have been
detected in several amoebal species [45]. As in the case of
several mimiviral ORFs closely related to homologues
from parasitic bacteria (see above), these flagellates may
have transferred genes to the Mimivirus infecting the same
amoebal hosts. A less parsimonious alternative hypothesis would be that these ORFs have been transferred to
Mimivirus by an unidentified third partner, for example
viruses infecting kinetoplastids and heterolobosea that
could have recombined with Mimivirus. However, the fact
that particles very similar to Mimivirus have been

observed in Naegleria supports the hypothesis of direct
gene acquisition at least from heterolobosean hosts.
The amoebas as complex ecosystems promoting HGT
The number of bacterial species that have been characterised as stable inhabitants of diverse amoebas seems to be
far from being completely known [33,46]. As commented
above, the promiscuity of these bacterial species within
amoebas may have facilitated HGT and the adaptation to
parasitic lifestyles [36]. Several eukaryotic parasites, such
as the kinetoplastid Perkinsiella, can also be found in
amoebas [45]. Moreover, there is increasing evidence that
the use of amoebas as a reservoir can be a key factor in the
selection of virulent strains of eukaryotic parasites of
mammals, in particular several pathogenic dimorphic
fungi [47,48]. Mimiviruses infecting amoebas can thus
coexist in a confined environment with a variety of other

parasites. In addition to the DNA from the amoebal host,
the sporadic cell lysis of these parasites provides DNA that
can be a source of new genes for the virus. The acquisition
of genes from the host and from its bacterial and eukaryotic parasites may be significant in the development of virulence traits of the virus, but also in its opportunistic preadaptation to alternative hosts, including humans. This
has been shown to be an important process in other pathogens. For example, the parasitic bacterium L. pneumophila
has acquired by HGT several eukaryotic genes involved in
a variety of cell functions, in particular two serine/threonine protein kinases [49]. It has been shown in several
pathogens that these protein kinases are responsible of
inhibiting phagosome-lysosome fusion, allowing intracellular survival, but also of disrupting the host defence by
interfering with the eukaryotic signal transduction pathways [50,51]. Interestingly, Mimivirus possesses three ser-

ine/threonine protein kinases (MIMI_R818, MIMI_R826
and MIMI_R831) that have been acquired from its amoebal hosts (see above and Figure 3). This is also the case for
the RAS GTPase MIMI_R214. The presence of these proteins suggests that Mimivirus can regulate the host cell
cycle to its benefit. This is an example of the crucial role
that HGT may have had in the evolution of the virulence
strategy of Mimivirus.

pled every 100 generations (the first 2,500 trees were discarded as "burnin").

Conclusion

Additional material

Most of the genes in Mimivirus with homologues in cellular organisms appear to have been acquired by HGT to the
virus. This strongly supports that Mimivirus does not
define a new domain of life. Mimivirus certainly acquired
most of these genes either from its eukaryotic hosts or
from other parasites coexisting in the same host. In that
sense, this virus appears to have followed a similar strategy as other parasites to interfere with host cellular processes through the modification and expression of genes
acquired from the host by HGT. Our data also suggest that
the primary hosts for Mimivirus are the Amoebozoa, as
most of the mimiviral ORFs of eukaryotic origin with a
well resolved phylogeny are closely related to homologues
from this group. Nevertheless, we detect HGT from putative alternative hosts, such as heterolobosea (e.g., Naegleria) and kinetoplastids. Despite the fact that Mimivirus
appears to have the capacity to infect also humans
[46,52,53], we identified only a single case of a probable
gene acquisition from animals, the glycosyltransferases
MIMI_L230 and MIMI_R699 (Supplementary Figure 15
in Additional data file 2). This small number suggests that
the recently reported human infection by this virus may
be a relatively rare or very recent event.

Methods
Phylogenetic reconstruction methods
Homologues for each Mimivirus ORF were retrieved from
the NCBI protein non-redundant data base after identification by BLAST [54]. The sequences were aligned with
CLUSTALW [55] and the alignment was manually refined
with the program ED of the MUST package [56]. Regions
where homology between sites was doubtful were
removed before the phylogenetic analysis.

Data sets were analysed by Maximum likelihood (ML)
using the JTT model with a Γ law (4 rate categories) and a
proportion of invariant sites using the program PHYML
[57]. To asses the topologies found by ML, several data
sets were also analysed with Bayesian methods using the
program MrBAYES 3 with a mixed substitution model and
a Γ law (6 rate categories) and a proportion of invariant
sites to take among-site rate variation into account [58].
The Markov chain Monte Carlo search was run with 4
chains for 1,000,000 generations, with trees being sam-
