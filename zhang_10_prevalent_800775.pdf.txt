Abstract
Background: Mutations in the basic core promoter (BCP) and its adjacent precore (preC) region in HBV genome
are common in chronic hepatitis B patients. However, the patterns of mutation combinations in these two regions
during chronic infection are less understood. This study focused on single base mutations in BCP and preC region
and the multi-mutation patterns observed in chronic HBV infection patients.
Methods: Total 192 blood samples of chronic HBV infection patients were included. Direct PCR sequencing on the
target region of HBV genome was successfully conducted in 157 samples. The rest 35 samples were analyzed by
clone sequencing. Only the nucleotide substitutions with their frequencies no less than 10% were included in
multi-mutation analysis with the exception for the polymorphic sites between genotypes B and C.
Results: Five high frequency mutations (≥10%) were found in BCP and preC region. Thirteen types of multimutations in one fragment were observed, among which 3 types were common combinations (≥5%). The top
three multi-mutations were A1762T/G1764A (36%), A1762T/G1764A/G1896A (11%) and T1753(A/C)/A1762T/G1764A/
G1896A (8%). Patients with multi-mutations in viral genomes (≥3) were more likely to have liver cirrhosis or
hepatocellular carcinoma (OR = 3.1, 95% CI: 1.6-6.0, P = 0.001). G1896A mutation seemed to be involved in liver
disease progression independent of the patient age (OR = 3.6, 95% CI: 1.5-8.6; P = 0.004). In addition, patients with
more viral mutations detected (≥3) were more likely to be HBeAg negative (OR = 2.7, 95% CI: 1.1-6.4; P = 0.027).
Moreover, G1776A mutation was shown to contribute to HBeAg negativity in our study (OR = 8.6, 95% CI: 1.2-44.9;
P = 0.01).
Conclusions: Patients with advanced liver diseases and with HBeAg negativity more likely have multi-mutations in
HBV genomes but with different mutation combination patterns. G1896A mutation appears to be independent of
infection history.

Background
The basic core promoter (BCP, nt 1742-1849) and its
adjacent precore (preC) region are crucial for replication
of HBV. BCP binds various liver factors and preC forms
ε structure in pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) as the encapsidation signal [1-3]. Changes in viral replication may
influence the progression of liver diseases, particularly in
fulminant hepatitis and acute exacerbation of chronic

hepatitis [4,5]. Mounting evidence has emerged to
demonstrate that BCP and preC mutants are predisposed to severe and progressive liver diseases after HBV
infection, causing an increased risk for hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) [6-10]. For instance, mutations
T1762/A1764 and A1899 have been reported to be independent risk factors for HCC [11], and T1653 and/or
V1753 mutations are believed to promote the process of
liver degradation [12]. However, the association of these
mutations with severe symptoms is manifested in certain
populations but not in others [13,14].
Studies have been shown that G1896A is involved in
HBeAg negativity by introducing a stop codon in the
preC region [15]. Although the 1762T/1764A double

mutation, commonly occurring in HBeAg-negative
patients, was observed in vivo to suppress the production of preC mRNA independent of G1896A, recent in
vitro research suggested other single site substitutions
rather than these two may be responsible for the reduction of HBeAg expression [5,16,17]. Unknown mutations
in this core promoter may impede the seroconversion of
HBeAg during antiviral treatment [18].
In the BCP and preC regions, multi-substitutions
further complicate mutation research. Triple core promoter mutations C1753T/A1762T/G1764A occurred
more commonly in genotype C compared with genotype
B [19]. For genotype D, A1757 mutants were prone to
accompany with the T1764/G1766 double mutation
[20]. In vitro experiments have shown multi-mutations
may increase viral replication efficiency in Lamivudine
resistant strains [21]. However, the mutation combination in BCP and preC and its clinical significance are
less understood in chronic HBV infection patients.
This study focused on substitutions in BCP and preC
regions and their combinations in different stages of
chronic HBV related liver diseases.

Methods
Patients and blood samples

A total of 192 chronic HBV infection patients were
enrolled at You’an Hospital (Beijing, China) and Jinxiang
County People’s Hospital (Shandong Province, China)
(Additional file 1, Table S1). A diagnostic workup was
performed including physical examination, laboratory
and or liver pathology according to the criteria suggested
by Chinese Medical Association for Liver Diseases in
2005[22]. Liver function test and serum HBV marker
screening were conventionally conducted. No patient had
co-infection with hepatitis C virus, hepatitis D virus, or
human immunodeficiency virus. Basic patient characters
have been summarized in Table 1. Blood samples (5 ml
each) were collected, and cells and sera were then separated and stored at -20°C. The study was approved by the
Ethics Committees of the institutions, and informed consent was obtained from all patients.
Serological HBV marker detection

Serological markers were detected by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay on a Roche E170 modular
immunoassay analyzer following the manufacturer’s protocols (Roche Diagnostics, Germany).

Viral DNA extraction

Viral DNA was extracted from 200 μL sera per sample
using an AccuPrep Genomic DNA Extraction Kit (Bioneer, Korea) or QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin (Qiagen,
Germany) as instructed in the manufacturer’s manuals.
All DNA samples were stored at -20°C before thawing
for PCR.
Fragment amplification

All PCRs were performed in 20 μL or 50 μL reaction
mixtures containing specimen DNA. PCR for amplification of target regions was performed with a hot start at
95°C for 150 s, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at
94°C for 1 min, annealing at 58°C for 90 s, and elongation at 72°C for 3 min. All reactions were performed on
a PTC-200 Peltier Thermal Cycler (MJ Research, USA).
The primers employed were CP5: 5’-CTTCGTCTGCG
AGGCGAGGG-3’ (nt 2381-2400) and CP22: 5’-GAGA
CCACCGTGAACGCCCA-3’ (nt 1611-1630).
PCR and clone sequencing

PCR products were purified with a Montage PCR96
column (Millipore, USA). The final DNA concentration in the sequencing reaction was 10 ng/μL. DNA
sequencing was carried out on a Prism 3730 (ABI,
USA). Contigs were assembled using SeqMan (DNASTAR, USA) and all the sequences were aligned by
ClustalW for further analysis (all sequences analyzed
in this paper have been submitted to GenBank) (Additional file 1, Table S3).
The PCR products were first purified with a Takara
gel purification kit and were then ligated into pMD18 T
vector (Takara Bio, Japan). Vectors were subsequently
transfected into DH5a cells and white/blue colony
selection was used to detect recombinant vectors.
Inserts from positive clones were PCR amplified with
primers RV-M/M13-47 according to the manufacturer’s
instructions to verify the target fragments.
Viral genotyping

The phylogenetic tree (Additional file 1, Figure S1) was
built for all 157 sequences and 858 strains from 8 genotypes retrieved from the NCBI database, using Mega 4
[23] and annotated by TreeDyn [24]. All the fragments
of BCP and preC were from whole genomes in the
NCBI database with genotypes annotated.
Statistical Analysis

HBV DNA quantification

Real time PCR was performed to determine viral DNA
titers using an FQ-PCR Kit for HBV (DaAn Gene Co.,
China) performed in a GeneAmp 5700 Sequence Detection System (PE Applied Biosystems, USA).

Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software
(version 13.0; SPSS Inc, USA). Logistic regression was
used for evaluating the roles of candidate clinical factors
and viral mutations in liver disease progression and
HBeAg negativity.

Results
High prevalent mutations in BCP and preC regions

A total of 300 viral fragments from nt 1725 to 1900, covering the BCP and preC regions in the HBV genome,
were analyzed. As shown in Table 1, direct sequencing
resulted 157 fragments from patients of 13 asymptomatic
carrier (ASC), 75 chronic hepatitis (CH), 44 liver failure
(LF), and 11 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). LF, LC,
and HCC were defined as advanced liver diseases (ALD).
The rest 143 sequences came from clone sequencing in
which 95 clones were from 17 samples of LC patients

and 48 from 18 samples of HCC patients. Figure 1 illustrates the nucleotide substitution patterns identified by
PCR sequencing. Similar mutation profiles were shown
in samples collected in Beijing (136) and in a relatively
isolated town 600 km south from Beijing (21). Mutations
were rarely seen in gene overlapping regions. About 82%
(128/157) sequences were genotype C and the rest were
type B by clustering with reported sequences in NCBI
database (Additional file 1, Figure S1). There were 12
nucleotide substitutions with their mutation rates over
5% (Additional file 1, Table S2). Further comparison of

Figure 1 Nucleotide substitution profiles in BCP and preC. The top panel illustrates frequencies of all mutations in the BCP and preC of viral
genomes. Hot spots of mutations are largely congruent in patients from Beijing (upper half) and Jinxiang (lower half) except for different
mutation rates at certain positions. The bottom panel demonstrates the positions of the X gene, BCP and preC gene in the region. The
overlapped part for all three regions is unlikely to mutate.

these sites with 233 genotype B and 311 genotype C of
HBV sequences from NCBI database demonstrated that
five were at the genotype specific positions and were
therefore precluded from further analysis (Table 2).
Interestingly, in three previously reported common
mutations G1764A, A1762T, and G1896A in this region,
the first two types were observed with very high prevalence in these samples (70% and 67%, respectively) (Additional file 1, Table S2).
G1896A mutation in liver disease progression

Next we analyzed all substitutions in the ALD group to
reveal possible risk factors for liver disease progression.
In univariate binary logistic regression analysis, all the
top five high occurrence mutations seemed to relate to
ALD, including T1753A/C (OR = 3.2, 95% CI: 1.3-7.9,
P = 0.013), A1762T (OR = 3.1, 95% CI: 1.5-6.5,
P = 0.003), G1764A (OR = 4.8, 95% CI: 2.1-10.9, P <
0.001), T1803A/G (OR = 5.1, 95% CI: 1-25.4, P = 0.058),
and G1896A (OR = 2.4, 95% CI: 1.2-5.0, P = 0.015).
However, in patients older than 35, age appears to be a
significant factor in disease progression (OR = 5.5, 95%
CI: 2.6-11.5, P < 0.0001), raising the question if the significance of above mutations in ALD was simply due to
the accumulation of mutations during long infection
history. Indeed subsequent multivariate binary logistic
regression analysis indicated that only the mutation
G1896A significantly correlated to the disease progression independent of age (P = 0.007, Table 3). Patients
with the G1896A (mean age 40 ± 11) had similar average age with those without this mutation (mean age
38 ± 14) but more had ALD (FET, P = 0.005, Table 1).
G1776A statistically correlated to HBeAg negativity

Although having their viral DNA load detected (> 103
copies/ml), some patients in our study were shown to
be HBeAg negative, suggesting their HBeAg negativity
was not caused by the disappearance or reduction of
viral replication. To identify possible mutations correlating to HBeAg negativity, clinical status and viral substitution patterns in BCP and preC were compared
between HBeAg negative and positive groups. As shown
in Table 4, HBeAg negative patients contained more
mutations in viral genomes and were also prone to

develop more severe liver diseases such as liver cirrhosis
and carcinoma. Additionally, these patients seemed also
to have higher levels of aspartate transaminase (AST)
(chi-square test, P = 0.003).
We then did regression analysis for all common mutations (≥5%). Univariate binary logistic regression analysis
showed significant correlation of several substitutions
with the HBeAg negativity, including G1776A (OR =
8.1, 95% CI: 1.7-39; P = 0.009), A1846T (OR = 3.8, 95%
CI: 1.2-11.8; P = 0.02), G1896A (OR = 3.5, 95% CI: 1.48.6; P = 0.007), and the number of individual point
mutations ≥ 3 (OR = 2.8, 95% CI: 1.1-6.8; P = 0.027). By
contribution of G1776A to HBeAg negativity was
further verified in multivariate binary logistic regression
analysis G1896A, a common mutation known to introduce a stop codon in e antigen, showed tendency in correlation to HBeAg negativity (P = 0.055; Table 5).
Moreover, within a recently identified binding site for
the transcription factor FXRalpha [25], G1776A was verified to associate with the HBeAg negativity significantly
(P = 0.010). Therefore, nt 1776 appears to be a novel
candidate corresponding to the loss of e-antigen.
Common multi-mutations in BCP and preC regions

Next we analyzed the effect of multi-mutations in target
region. First we defined multi-mutations detected in a
single fragment as the mutation combination or the
combination in short. Five point mutations (1753, 1762,
1764, 1846, and 1896) with their rates larger than 10%
were included in combination analysis. Nineteen categories containing wild type, single base mutations and
observed combinations were resulted as illustrated in
Figure 2. The top three combinations in all 192 patients
were the double mutation A1762T/G1764A (36%), the
triple mutation A1762T/G1764A/G1896A (11%), and
the quadruple mutation T1753(A/C)/A1762T/G1764A/
G1896A (8%).
While comparing the results of PCR sequencing and
clone sequencing, we noticed an interesting phenomenon. All the mutation combinations observed in PCR
sequencing were also detected in single strains obtained
by clone sequencing, suggesting that point mutations
tended to coexist in single genomes rather than to
occur in various fragments among viral quasispecies
(Figure 2). In addition, these combinations were also
seen in NCBI sequences of both genotype B and C
(Figure 3).
Multi-mutations in ALD patients

As shown in Figure 2, the distribution of above multimutations was different between ALD and other patients
(ASC and CH) (FET, P < 0.0001). Patients with the
combinations of more than 3 mutations were more
likely to have ALD (OR = 3.1, 95% CI: 1.6-6.0, P =

A1762T/G1764A) was dominant in these patients (FET,
P = 0.025). Furthermore, ALD patients (mean age 46 ±
11) were older than others (mean age 33 ± 12; T-Test,
P < 0.0001) and the patients with no less than 3 viral
mutations (mean age 42 ± 12) were also older than the
rest (mean age 36 ± 13) (P = 0.009), suggesting that the
age, which usually represent the infection history
appears to be a correlating factor in liver disease
progression.

truncated e antigen by a stop codon caused by mutation, was verified to be responsible for HBeAg negativity. In this study, we showed that G1776A is a new
candidate mutation correlating to HBeAg negativity.
Since nt1776 localizes at the binding site to transcription factor FXRalpha, which promotes the expression
of e antigen [25], one possible mechanism for G1776A
mutation is to interrupt normal transcription of preC
region. As this is the first time proposing possible role
of G1776A, further verification is needed in larger
sample size.

Discussion
Candidate mutations responsible for the loss of e antigen

Previous studies have suggested high mutations in BCP
and preC regions are major cause for the loss of
HBeAg but without true disappearance or reduction of
viral load. Thus far only G1896A, which leads a 2/3

Figure 2 Combination patterns of viral mutations in patients with different diagnoses. Point utations identified in the PCR and clone
sequencing were demonstrated along the x-axis. “0” represents strains without mutations in indicated sites. Only certain combinations were
detected among a number of calculated possibilities. Grey parts illustrated combinations of no less than 3 sites, and their frequencies were on
the right top. Mutation profiles were more complicated in patients of liver failure (LF), liver cirrhosis (LC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
than those of asymptomatic carrier (ASC) and chronic hepatitis (CH). Mutation combinations in LC and HCC patients were identified by both
direct PCR sequencing and clone sequencing.

accumulated mutations fell into two categories. Mutations in first type were adaptive to host system after
long infection but had little effect in the disease progression. A feature of those mutations, including T1753A/C,
G1764A and A1762T, is their significance as risk factors
in disease progression only shown by univariate analysis
but not in the multivairate model when patient age was
considered. The second type, such as G1896A, has high
occurrence in ALD patients and is independent from
infection history, suggesting mutants carrying this substitution may lead to worsening symptoms once they
appear.
The occurrence rates of T1764 and A1762 were very
high in our study (70% and 67%, respectively). This is
perhaps because the major path of HBV infection is vertical transmission in China and patients in their ages of
30 s are usually already with long infection history [9].
The effects of G1762A and A1764T in disease progression had attracted attentions especially in genotypes B
and C [27,28], however our study suggests that the
appearance of these mutations may just be a sign of

long infection history and may not be very important in
disease prognosis.
Common combinations of prevalent substitutions in
BCP and preC

Few studies have been conducted about combination of
common nucleotide substitutions, and here we present
multi-mutations with high frequencies in patients with
various diagnoses. Mutation combination appeared as a
common type of variation in HBV genome regardless of
genotypes. Despite many possible patterns, only 13 combinations were observed based on 5 common substitutions in our study. These limited multi-mutation
patterns indicate only certain combinations may have
selective advantage for viral functions which makes it
possible to interrogate their effects in disease progression. However, limited samples for each mutation combination reduce the statistic power to dissect their
distribution in patients with different diagnoses. Therefore, larger sample size should be considered in further
investigation

Figure 3 Combination patterns of viral mutations in HBeAg(+/-) patients and genotype B/C strains. Point mutations identified in the PCR
and clone sequencing were demonstrated along the x-axis. “0” represents strains without mutations in indicated sites. Grey parts illustrated
combinations of no less than 3 sites, and their frequencies were on the right top.HBeAg negative(-) patients demonstraed more complicated
mutation combinations than those of HBeAg postive(+). Mutation profiles were similar in genotype B and C strains in both NCBI database and
samples obtained in this study.

Conclusions
Based on 192 patients from northern China, analysis of
common mutations and their combinations were conducted in BCP and preC regions. G1896A was indicated
to be associated with liver disease progression independent of the infection history. G1776A mutation was statistically responsible for HBeAg negativity. Mutation
profiles of viral genomes were complicated in ALD
patients and HBeAg negative patients. Common mutation combinations were observed by both PCR and
clone sequencing, indicating their coexistences in single
fragment.
