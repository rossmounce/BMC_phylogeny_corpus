Abstract
Background: The availability of 12 fully sequenced Drosophila species genomes provides an
excellent opportunity to explore the evolutionary mechanism, structure and function of gene
families in Drosophila. Currently, several important resources, such as FlyBase, FlyMine and
DroSpeGe, have been devoted to integrating genetic, genomic, and functional data of Drosophila
into a well-organized form. However, all of these resources are gene-centric and lack the
information of the gene families in Drosophila.
Description: FlyPhy is a comprehensive phylogenomic analysis platform devoted to analyzing the
genes and gene families in Drosophila. Genes were classified into families using a graph-based
Markov Clustering algorithm and extensively annotated by a number of bioinformatic tools, such
as basic sequence features, functional category, gene ontology terms, domain organization and
sequence homolog to other databases. FlyPhy provides a simple and user-friendly web interface to
allow users to browse and retrieve the information at multiple levels. An outstanding feature of the
FlyPhy is that all the retrieved results can be added to a workset for further data manipulation. For
the data stored in the workset, multiple sequence alignment, phylogenetic tree construction and
visualization can be easily performed to investigate the sequence variation of each given family and
to explore its evolutionary mechanism.
Conclusion: With the above functionalities, FlyPhy will be a useful resource and convenient
platform for the Drosophila research community. The FlyPhy is available at http://
bioinformatics.zj.cn/fly/.

Background
Fruit flies have been studied for many years and one species of them, in particular D. melanogaster, is a very impor-

tant model organism for understanding genetic,
developmental, cellular, ecological, and evolutionary
processes. The sequencing of D. melanogaster and D. pseuPage 1 of 6

doobscura genome, first resealed in 2000 and 2005, respectively, provide significant contributions to the fruit fly
biology and genome research [1,2]. With ever-developing
large-scale sequencing technologies, 12 Drosophila
genomes are available and accessible online now [3,4].
The availability of these Drosophila genomes offers an
unprecedented opportunity to explore the evolution of
Drosophila gene families, which can serve as a significant
base for functional genomics and provide an important
advance for understanding sequence-structure-function
relationships of Drosophila genes among different species.
For example, comparative genomics analysis revealed that
there was a high-frequency occurrence of gene gain and
loss in Drosophila gene families, even among closely
related Drosophila species [5]. Genome-wide comparison
of immune-system genes in Drosophila revealed that, in
contrast to signaling proteins, effector proteins are much
more likely to vary in copy number across different Drosophila species [6]. Based on phylogenomic approaches,
the possible reason for the origin of new genes and subsequent lineage-specific evolution at different time nodes in
the Drosophila is well revealed from a genome-wide level
[7].
Development of effective and integrated bioinformatics
databases and tools is an important work for facilitating
more rapid progress in Drosophila research, which will
provide a convenient aid to Drosophila research communities. In support of this, several databases have been
devoted to Drosophila in a well-organized form. FlyBase is
a premier public database with integrated genetic,
genomic, and functional data of Drosophila[8]. FlyMine is
a comprehensive database with gene expression data of
Drosophila [9] and DroSpeGe is a genome database with
comparative annotations of 12 Drosophila species [3].
Other resources such as Berkeley Drosophila Genome
Project [10] and AAA [11] are also useful resources for
Drosophila biologists. However, all of these available
resources are gene-centric. The Dfam database contains
descriptions of the families, alignments, gene trees [5],
but there is no integrated database to provide comprehensive information on gene families of Drosophila. Comparative genomics and molecular evolution analysis of
Drosophila gene families has been demonstrated to be a
powerful approach to study their evolution, structure and
function. In this study, we applied a graph-based Markov
Clustering algorithm to classify all the Drosophila proteins
into families. Thereby, a comprehensive platform containing putative protein families with extensive annotation information of 12 fruit fly species was developed.
Users can easily interact with the protein families of their
interest and other relevant detail annotations of genes by
browsing, keyword searching or BLASTing. Through the
workset, the retrieved data can be well integrated for phylogenomic analysis.

Construction and content
Protein family clustering and detailed annotation
Protein families can be expressed as a group of proteins
that share significant similarity in sequence and have a
common evolutionary history. In comparison with other
tools for grouping different proteins into putative families, such as BLASTClust (from the NCBI BLAST suite) and
cd-hit program [12], the TribeMCL [13] has been proved
to be a good alternative choice for clustering of divergent
proteins and thus has wide applications [14-16]. The
TribeMCL program first calculates the pair-wise distances
between all genes from the genomes and then uses a
graph-based Markov Clustering algorithm to generate
clusters. With such algorithm, it can effectively break the
barriers during the clustering process, such as multidomains, fragments of proteins and promiscuous
domains in the alignment. The main parameter that influences the number and size of clusters in the TribeMCL
program is the inflation value, which defines the tightness
of the clustering results [13]. In this study, we used the
TribeMCL program to generate protein families from 181,
780 protein sequences of 12 Drosophila species [17]. An
all-against-all BLASTP was performed for the protein
sequences using the BLAST program with an E-value of 1e5. Finally, putative protein families were generated using
the TribeMCL program with multiple inflation values
(1.5, 2.5, 3.0, 4.0 and 5.0 respectively). We found that different inflation parameters produced similar results and
the cluster size varied greatly in different families (Figure
1), indicating the frequent gene gain-and-loss in Drosophila. As expected, a large number of clusters with a family size of 12 were observed and the majority of them
represented families with only one gene in each species.
For example, among the 3,454 families (family size = 12)
obtained from the inflation value 3, a total of 3,055 families had a one-to-one orthologous relationship. It is suggested that these families may represent a core set of genes
and universally present in different Drosophila species.

Then these genes and gene families were extensively annotated based on a number of bioinformatic tools and databases. In particular, the PepStat program implemented in
the EMBOSS package was used to predict the molecular
weight and isoelectric point of a given protein [18]. The
InterProScan program was used to assign gene domain
architectures against integrated databases, including
PROSITE, PRINTS, Pfam, ProDom, SMART, TIGRFAMs,
PIRSF and SUPERFAMILY. The InterProScan results were
mapped to Gene Ontology terms, including cellular component, biological process and molecular function, using
the InterPro2Go [19]. BLAST searches were performed
against several major databases, such as PDB (collected on
18 December 2008), Uniprot (release 14.6) and Refseq
(release 32). The best hit from the Uniprot database was
used as a controlled vocabulary for the description of gene

function. In addition, the functional categorization of all
genes and protein families was carried out by BLASTing to
the COG and KEGG databases with an E-value of 1e-5. In
order to annotate each cluster, we obtained the annotation information in KEGG pathway related to each member in the clusters, and then manually curated the most
common description of the members in each cluster and
assign them to the clusters.
Database construction
The design scheme of FlyPhy is similar to our previous
integrated pipeline of ArchaeaTF [20] and, PlasmoGF
[15], which is constructed based on open source software,
including Apache, MySQL, PHP and Perl, etc. The curated
data of gene families, as well as various annotation information, are stored in a MySQL database system and can
be accessed using Structure Query Language (SQL). The
web platform is base on Apache HTTP server and its pages
are generated via a combination of PHP language and Perl
CGI scripts. Meanwhile, the BioPerl modules are applied
to manipulate data and convert different data formats. All
the procedures above are executed on the Linux operating
system.

Utility and discussion
Data retrieving
FlyPhy provides a simple and user-friendly interface for
researchers to access gene and gene family data (Figure 2).
Users can browse and search (both keyword search and
sequence similarity search) all the data at different levels
by the integrated functions.
Browse
all the genes have been organized into different functional
categories according to the COG and KEGG database.
Individual COG category can be browsed easily in the
COG browser as well as the list of genes classified under
each specific COG category. The KEGG pathway can be
explored in the same way in the KEGG browser. Clicking
on the gene ID will show its detailed annotation information, such as basic sequence features, Gene Ontology
terms, gene domain organization and sequence homolog
to other relevant databases.
Keyword search
FlyPhy provides a powerful multi-layered query system.
Firstly, in the search page, users can search genes by keywords (gene ID or gene definition), or by clusters under
different inflation parameters (eg: cluster ID, cluster size
and cluster definition). Meanwhile, the functional catego-

ries of different gene family can also be retrieved by KEGG
or COG ID and keyword. The search results will be shown
in table with the basic information of each gene matching
the query. In the table, the IDs of each gene and its clusters
are linked to the detailed annotation of the gene and clusters.
Sequence similarity search
We have generated genes and protein databases for all the
families, and enabled protein or nucleotide BLAST in
FlyPhy. This facility will help users query and verify the
members of a specific gene family based on their own
sequences. Further, with the implement of the ViroBLAST
program [21], the sequence similarity search of FlyPhy
provides many advanced options to allow users to easily
parse and manipulate the search results.

tinue to collect relevant fly data once fully sequenced
genome of other Drosophila species is available. More phylogenomic tools will be incorporated to help users reconstruct the evolutionary history of gene families, such as
the TREE-PUZZLE program for phylogenetic tree construction based on maximum likelihood algorithm and
the PAML program for evolutionary rate inference. We
believe that FlyPhy will serve as a useful platform for Drosophila biologists and relevant researchers to study the
comparative genomics and phylogenomics of fly gene
families efficiently and conveniently.

Workset-centric data manipulation and phylogenomic
analysis
An important functionality of FlyPhy is that it adopts the
workset to organize the genes and protein families (Figure
2). All the retrieved results can be added to the workset for
further data manipulation and phylogenomic analysis.
Each workset is assigned with a specific ID either generated by the server randomly or saved as a user's own
favorite name. All the data in the workset can be customized through appending or deleting the items. More
importantly, FlyPhy allows users to load an old workset
by ID if they ever had established before to avoid generating the same workset from scratch.

To explore the sequence conservation of the data stored in
the workset, multiple sequence alignment can be performed using either the ClustalW [22] or MUSCLE program [23] with user-definable parameters at amino acid
or DNA level. Visualization of the aligned results is conducted by the Jalview program [24], which is based on
Java Applet (prior to use this program, a Java Runtime
Environment is needed on the local computer). To investigate the evolutionary relationship of genes or proteins
stored in the workset, users can directly use the QuickTree
program to construct a phylogenetic tree [25], which is
based on the neighbor-joining algorithm. The reliability
of the tree can be evaluated with different replicates of
bootstrapping test. The graphical representation of the
inferred tree is carried out using the ATV program [26].

Conclusion
The purpose of constructing FlyPhy is to develop a comprehensive platform on which users can access detailed
annotation information, investigate the sequence variation and explore the evolutionary mechanism of each
family in Drosophila. Through the form of workset, the
retrieved data are well integrated, and phylogenomic analysis can be easily performed. In the future, we will con-
