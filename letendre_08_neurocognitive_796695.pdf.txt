HIV-infected individuals are at risk for a spectrum of neurocognitive disorders. Research performed in developed
and resource-limited settings indicates that over half of
HIV-infected individuals may have neurocognitive
impairment of at least mild severity. An important issue
complicating the pathogenesis of these disorders is the coexistence of multiple neurotoxic conditions. Two important comorbidities are co-infection with Hepatitis C Virus
(HCV) and use of stimulants, such as methamphetamine
(MA).
The WHO estimates that 3% of the world's population has
been infected with HCV, leaving 170 million chronically
infected. HCV co-infects approximately a third of all HIVinfected individuals, 75-90% of HIV-infected intravenous
drug users, and nearly 100% of some groups of HIVinfected hemophiliacs. The longer life expectancy of HIVinfected individuals since the advent of combination
antiretroviral therapy has highlighted the impact of
chronic HCV, which has emerged as a frequent cause of
death in HIV-infected people.

Chronic or heavy exposure to MA has also been associated
with brain injury. MA may injure the brain by multiple
mechanisms including interfering with dopamine metabolism, altering glutamate processing by astrocytes,
increasing TNF-alpha expression, and worsening oxidative stress. In HIV-infected individuals, MA may also
increase HIV replication.
These and other data support that each of these conditions can lead to brain injury and that their effects may be
additive. The high prevalences of these conditions also
highlight important public health concerns. For example,
the substantial cognitive impairment in these populations
may negatively affect their ability to manage complex
medical therapy. As a result, their likelihood of recovery and survival - may be greatly reduced.

A growing body of literature fuels the notion that HCV can
injure the brain. First, HCV can infect resident (e.g., astrocytes) and migrating (e.g., macrophages) cells of the central nervous system (CNS). Second, HCV can adapt to
neural cells, as evidenced by phylogenetic compartmentalization. Third, the neuropsychological (NP) performance of HCV-infected individuals is more likely to be
impaired than that of uninfected individuals. Fourth,
magnetic resonance spectroscopy demonstrates that HCVinfected individuals have elevated choline-to-creatine
ratios in the basal ganglia and white matter, suggesting
inflammation, and reduced N-acetyl aspartate in white
matter, suggesting neuronal loss.
