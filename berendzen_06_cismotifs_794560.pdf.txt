Abstract
Background: The discovery of cis-regulatory motifs still remains a challenging task even though
the number of sequenced genomes is constantly growing. Computational analyses using pattern
search algorithms have been valuable in phylogenetic footprinting approaches as have expression
profile experiments to predict co-occurring motifs. Surprisingly little is known about the nature of
cis-regulatory element (CRE) distribution in promoters.
Results: In this paper we used the Motif Mapper open-source collection of visual basic scripts for
the analysis of motifs in any aligned set of DNA sequences. We focused on promoter motif
distribution curves to identify positional over-representation of DNA motifs. Using differentially
aligned datasets from the model species Arabidopsis thaliana, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila
melanogaster and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we convincingly demonstrated the importance of the
position and orientation for motif discovery. Analysis with known CREs and all possible
hexanucleotides showed that some functional elements gather close to the transcription and
translation initiation sites and that elements other than the TATA-box motif are conserved
between eukaryote promoters. While a high background frequency usually decreases the
effectiveness of such an enumerative investigation, we improved our analysis by conducting motif
distribution maps using large datasets.
Conclusion: This is the first study to reveal positional over-representation of CREs and promoter
motifs in a cross-species approach. CREs and motifs shared between eukaryotic promoters
support the observation that an eukaryotic promoter structure has been conserved throughout
evolutionary time. Furthermore, with the information on positional enrichment of a motif or a
known functional CRE, it is possible to get a more detailed insight into where an element appears
to function. This in turn might accelerate the in depth examination of known and yet unknown cisregulatory sequences in the laboratory.

Background
The enormous amount of sequence data produced by various sequencing projects requires the development of suitable bioinformatic tools to help with functional
characterization and annotation processes. One major
problem in the analysis of non-coding DNA is the accurate assignment of functional attributes to defined
stretches of sequence. For every gene, the sites for the initiation of transcription or translation are somehow
encrypted in the DNA-sequence. Patterns of motifs define
the positioning and the orientation of the basal transcription apparatus, which makes contact with the DNA at a
certain position and is constituted by the RNA polymerase
II complex and additional transcription factors. The DNAstretch essential for the recruitment of this multiproteincomplex is known to be the core promoter, a region that
covers some hundred base-pairs flanking the transcription
start site (TSS).
Accordingly, the sequences 5' of the translation start
codon ATG must encode for similar regulatory motifs that
influence mRNA-abundance prior to, during and after
transcription. As RNA elements embedded in the 5'
untranslated regions (UTR) of the mRNA are much more
complicated to study, only a few have been thoroughly
characterized [1]. It is assumed that these motifs are the
target sites for transcription factors or other regulatory
proteins that directly or indirectly affect RNA-transcript or
protein levels.
Although there are many cases known where genes
remained conserved throughout organism kingdoms,
only the TATA-box is mainly known to constitute a conserved motif in 30 – 40 % of the core promoters of most
species [2,3]. Besides the TATA-box, our knowledge and
understanding of cis-regulatory elements (CRE) in different organisms is sparse and in most cases CRE databases –
if they exist at all – are specific to one organism. In contrast to the accessibility of sequence information via computational means, the possibilities for promoter analysis
generally lag behind. Many computational programs exist
that investigate promoter sequences either based on the
frequency or on a positional bias [4-10]. In most cases
proof of the functionality or importance of the identified
motifs, in terms of a regulatory effect on transcript abundance, is lacking. The identification of sequence patterns
involved in regulation is therefore an ongoing challenge
for the in-depth understanding of gene expression.
Promising work has been done in the plant field with Arabidopsis thaliana, where the genome sequence is completely available, the amount of non-coding sequences is
small, many regions close to the TSS are annotated and
large CRE databases exist [11-14,53]. Additionally, in
many genomes, particularly in eukaryotes, the majority of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/522

the sequences apart from the coding region do not provide useful biological information. Some improvement in
the identification of regulatory motifs was gained by combining phylogenetic data with intensive expression profile
analysis of co-regulated genes [15,16,3]. This approach is
not universally applicable as either promoter sequence
information on close phylogenetic relatives or the availability of expression data is lacking in many cases.
Large international sequencing programs have made the
genome sequences for numerous prokaryotes and various
eukaryote species available. Despite the fact that the
number of correctly annotated genes is increasing [51],
the amount of information is not yet sufficient to predict
the TSS or the promoter for most of these genomes
[13,17,18]. However, TSS prediction has been optimized
up to 70% accuracy for human genes [19].
Here, we describe an enumerative approach for the identification of functional CREs via motif distribution maps
in TSS or ATG rooted datasets. Moreover, we show that
motif distribution maps constitute a universal means for
the identification and characterization of motifs in promoter sequences of the model organisms Arabidopsis thaliana, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster and
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our analysis identifies several
motifs present in the promoters of all these eukaryote species, implying a universal promoter architecture that
extends over various kingdoms and goes beyond our
present image of promoter conservation.
The quality of our automated bulk extraction of promoters rooted with the TSS or the ATG was initially tested with
known elements that are specific to each of the sets. Subsequently, novel promoter specific motifs have been discovered. To investigate previously known CREs, motif
distribution maps were constructed, showing specific
curve characteristics such as maxima and minima. Here,
we focused on the analysis of conserved maxima only.
Our results also support the quality of the genome
sequences as such, and demonstrate that these are sufficient for bulk analysis of a large number of CREs.

Results and discussion
Comparison of tetranucleotide sequences
There are several recent publications on the identification
of putative cis-regulatory elements based on a frequency
bias or on the position of a certain DNA-motif [4,17,710]. We decided to combine both methods by aligning
sequences with respect to the annotated transcriptional
start site (TSS) or the ATG and search for motifs that have
alterations of both frequency and position. The motifs
under investigation were plotted in respect to their position to form motif distribution maps, which were subsequently analyzed for positional over- or under-

representation. A functional motif is defined by a frequency disequilibrium; a non random distribution at a
precise position [11,17,54]. As a similar approach was
undertaken earlier by Arkhipova with a preliminary, hand
edited dataset from Drosophila melanogaster [20], we first
attempted to reproduce her observations by using our
script collection and the annotated genomic sequence
available at the NCBI.
This analysis was performed on raw counts, but we have
decided to display all graphs for reasons of comparability,
as the percent of motifs relative to the total amount of
sequences per dataset.
The distribution of the tetranucleotide sequences TATA
and TCAG, which represent the palindromic TATA-box
core and the cap-site initiator motif respectively, was analyzed by Arkhipova [20] in 252 Drosophila derived TSS
rooted sequences spanning -250 bp to +50 bp. On the

basis of her work, Ohler et al. [21] determined the element distribution first in a frequency and subsequently in
a position dependent manner in 1941 sequences using
the same TSS region.
Here, we were able to extract 7954 Drosophila sequences
surrounding the annotated TSS from -250 bp to +50 bp.
To get an insight into how well the TSS's are annotated in
the databases, we used the 1941 sequences from Ohler et
al. [21], whose accuracy was validated using BLAST
searches [22].
Figure 1 shows motif distribution maps for TATA and
TCAG derived from our dataset compared with the 1941
high quality, hand edited sequence set by Ohler et al. [21].
As expected, the TATA-motif exhibits its highest frequency
at about -28 bp, while the TCAG-motif is found to be relatively enriched exactly at the transcription initiation site.

Comparison
Comparison of the motif distribution curves for the TCAG and TATA motifs in Drosophila promoters. Previously examined motifs, TCAG and TATA [20], were mapped in a hand edited dataset constructed by Ohler et al. [21] containing 1941 promoter sequences and an automatically assembled dataset of 7954 sequences derived from NCBI [59]. Relative
number of motifs per site (in percent) was mapped to their respective position. Datasets spanning -250 bp to +50 bp were
rooted with the position of the transcription start site (TSS) indicated as a grey bar. The absolute number of aligned sequences
contributing to the maximum raw value of the peaks is given above the curves [see Additional File 7].

two datasets are of comparable percentages, whereas the
relative peak height for the motifs of our GenBank dataset
is about half of the Ohler et al. [21] dataset (Figure 1). The
small portion of promoters containing a TATA-box and
the conservation of its relative position coincide with previous works [23,21,20].
Positional disequilibria of functional regulatory motifs
To get an impression of how much a motif is over-represented, we initially averaged over all counts per nucleotide
position and calculated the standard deviation for the 250 bp to +50 datasets. We considered a peak to be significant if it deviated by four or more standard deviations
from the background average. Additionally, to limit the
computational work, we focused on the highest peak for
each motif only.

For the dataset -250 bp to +50 bp rooted to the TSS we had
to assume that coding sequences might influence this
dataset, as 5'UTRs are sometimes shorter than 50 bp. To
find out how specific the positional information on the
four tetranucleotide sequences TATA, ATAA, TCAG and
TCAT is with respect to the TSS, we analyzed their curve
profiles in six different datasets (Table 1): two -250 bp to
+50 bp datasets and four additional sets covering longer
upstream regions -1500 bp to +50 bp and -1500 bp to -1
bp, all of which were rooted to the TSS or the ATG.
As we wanted to exclude the TCAT-motif from overlapping with the ATG translation start codon in the ATG
rooted datasets, we also included the CATG-motif in our
analysis for comparison. If the TCAT motif were a part of
the translation start site, we would expect to detect a peak
right next to the ATG. The results in Table 1 demonstrate
that the CATG-motif does not form a significant peak in
any of the TSS rooted datasets, however TCAT does, which
is indicative for the quality of the datasets' assembly with
respect to the TSS. We are therefore confident that any
short 5'UTR did not cause an informative peak detected in
the TSS dataset.
Moreover, a significant overrepresentation of ATAA, TATA
or TCAG was confirmed for the dataset used by Ohler et
al. [21]. Under our strong confidence interval neither the
palindomic TATA-motif nor the ATAA-sequence was considered to have a significant peak in both small -250 bp to
+50 bp GenBank assembled datasets. This can be
explained by the lower peak height in our datasets derived
from GenBank (Table 1). Therefore, we computed a different background model using counts from -1494 bp to 494 bp for each of the larger datasets (i.e. ≥ 1500 bp; Table
1). This reduced the background noise and we could
prove that all four motifs investigated by Arkhipova [20]
and Ohler et al. [21] are significantly enriched in all of the
larger GenBank datasets. Remarkably, the TCAG/T ele-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/522

ment again generally marks the TSS while the TATA-box
core is found about -30 bp upstream (Table 1).
The two related tetranucleotides, CATG which is predominantly found to constitute the translation start site and
the TCAT-transcription initiation motif, carry the common trinucleotide CAT and can principally represent two
different, non-overlapping molecular functions.
This hypothesis was resolved, when the translation start
codon ATG was included in any of the sets, the CATGmotif was indeed the most prominent and overlapped
with the position of the translation start site (Table 1). On
the other hand, the CATG-motif did not have a peak in
any TSS rooted dataset. Finally, if the translation start
codon ATG was removed from the analysis in the large
ATG rooted datasets of -1500 bp to -1 bp, the CATG-motif
was no longer significantly present. We concluded that we
were able to differentiate clearly between similar motifs
even with partially overlapping sequences. Hence, these
similar motifs may encode different functions with
respect to their position.
Evolutionary conservation of the Inr motif
An interesting question was, whether it might be possible
to differentiate between the known functional TSS consensus (Inr) of Drosophila TCAKTY [24] and the more
degenerate mammalian YYANWYY cis-regulatory element
[25]. To address this question, we conducted a comparative motif analysis on our two D. melanogaster GenBank
datasets spanning -1500 bp to +50 bp with these two
motifs.

Mapping the TCAKTY motif in the 7954 Drosophila
sequences rooted to the TSS, we found a distinct positional peak at the transcription initiation site (Figure 2).
Interestingly, we could also identify a significant peak for
the degenerate mammalian pattern YYANWYY in the Drosophila promoter sequences at about the same position.
Although it was more frequent due to its degeneracy, the
peak for the mammalian pattern YYANWYY still exceeds
our strong confidence interval of 4 times the standard
deviation over the background average. When a similar
dataset of 10672 sequences aligned to the start codon ATG
was used, both motifs lack significant curve profiles suggesting positional enrichment at the transcription start
site only (Figure 2).
Our observations support the overall correctness of the
annotated GenBank sequence data available, reaffirm that
the specific Drosophila TSS is well characterized and illustrate a generally conserved nature of eukaryotic transcription information, since the mammalian TSS does yield a
significant peak at the Drosophila TSS.

The hand edited dataset from Ohler et al. [21] was compared with datasets based on annotated promoters that were extracted from genomic
sequences derived from the NCBI [59]. The evaluation was conducted using motif distribution curves. Based on previous analysis [20], the
significance cutoff frequency for a positional disequilibrium must differ by ≥ 4 SD above the overall background average [see Additional File 8]. no
peak: based on our evaluation, no significant peaks could be identified.

Distribution curves of the transcription initiation motifs from mammals and Drosophila in promoter datasets of Drosophila
Distribution curves of the transcription initiation motifs from mammals and Drosophila in promoter datasets
of Drosophila. The motif distribution curves of the transcription initiation motif (Inr) of Drosophila TCAKTY [24] and of mammals YYANWYY [25] were constructed on 7954 automatically assembled sequences derived from NCBI [59]. Relative
number of motifs per site (in percent) was mapped to their respective position. The grey box indicates the region used to calculate the background average and its SD.

Motif distribution curves on the TATA-box
Although recent publications claimed that the annotated
sequences at the primary DNA-databases were not good
enough for unbiased bulk analysis of the TSS-upstream
sequences [13], we concluded the opposite on the basis of
the data presented so far. Hence, we broadened our analysis and acquired the sequences upstream of the TSS or the
ATG for the model organisms Arabidopsis thaliana,
Caenorhabditis elegans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae that are
representatives of three organism kingdoms. As there were
only very few genes in yeast that had an annotated TSS, we
focused on the dataset aligned to the translation start
codon ATG for this species only. As the most studied
eukaryotic CRE is the TATA-box, we concentrated on the
TATA-box hexanucleotides TATAAA and TATATA, as these
motifs appear to form the functional TATA-box sequences
at least for Drosophila and Arabidopsis [11,26,21,14].

To our knowledge no one has so far compared the positional occurrence of TATA-box sequences in different

organisms. We expected no distinct disequilibria for both
TATA-box motifs in the ATG rooted datasets for all four
organisms; instead, we assumed that there would be a
blurring effect caused by varying 5' UTR lengths. But the
TATAAA motif formed clearly visible positional peaks in
all of the datasets in the expected location (Figure 3),
which was in agreement with other reports on TATA-box
function [13,26,24,23]. The TATA-box motifs in S. cerevisiae have a wider breadth of enrichment and a double
peak even though they are rooted to the ATG and not the
TSS (Figure 3, see Additional File 1). This may be
explained by the known fact that the TATA-box motif has
a different positional dependence in S. cerevisiae (-120 bp
to -45 bp instead of -30 bp; [57]). Moreover, its relative
distance to the ATG was comparable between the different
organisms and, hence, the average size of the UTRs must
be similar. Indeed, when we plotted the length distribution of the UTRs of Arabidopsis thaliana, Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster, the UTRs of plant and
the fly were similar in size, whereas the average C. elegans

Distribution curves of the TATA-box motif TATAAA, its antisense TTTATA and the T/A-rich motif ATTAAA
Distribution curves of the TATA-box motif TATAAA, its antisense TTTATA and the T/A-rich motif
ATTAAA. The motif distribution curves of the TATA-box hexanucleotide TATAAA, its antisense TTTATA and the T/A-rich
motif ATTAAA were constructed on automatically assembled datasets of the Arabidopsis, Caenorhabditis, Drosophila and Saccharomyces genome sequences. Relative number of motifs per site (in percent) was mapped to their respective position. The grey
box indicates the region used to calculate the background average and its SD.

UTR was much shorter [see Additional File 2]. Saccharomyces is reported to have its average TSS at -15 bp to -75 bp
before the ATG [23].
One important point is that the random frequency variation within the motif distribution maps decreases with the
number of total sequences per dataset, which consequently affects the background based on the standard
deviation. Therefore, the large Arabidopsis thaliana ATG
rooted dataset with 26299 sequences was the most suitable to work with, while, in contrast, the C. elegans TSS
rooted dataset with only 885 Sequences generated the
largest amount of background noise.
To investigate the significance of the TATAAA motif, distribution curves were conducted for its antisense sequence
TTTATA and a motif having the same A/T-composition,
ATTAAA. As depicted in Figure 3, a subtle, non-significant
peak could be seen for the TTTATA, even though it contains a TATA-signature and partially overlaps with the
TATA-box. Furthermore, no significant maxima could be
identified for the ATTAAA motif either. Thus, only the
sense oriented TATAAA motif exhibits appositional disequilibrium.
The motif distribution maps conducted on the TSS
aligned datasets revealed distinct peaks for TATA-box hexanucleotides for Arabidopsis as well as for D. melanogaster
(Figure 3 and see Additional File 1). In the case of the
TATAAA motif, peaks found for the two organism sets
exceeded the average background distribution by 50-fold
or more. Only the TATAAA element formed an analyzable
peak in the dataset from C. elegans, but only in the ATGrooted set (Figure 3). This might be explained either by
the formation of multigene operons in Caenorhabditis, in
which 15 % of all genes underlying transcriptional regulation are organized as polycistronic pre-mRNA [27,28] or
by the existence of alternative TATA-like motifs with a
degenerate nucleotide composition. Consequently, without this information the examined motifs can not be identified with significance.
To investigate the general occurrence of motifs carrying
the same content of T and A mononucleotides, all 50 permutations of the TATAAA or TATATA hexamers were
mapped in our reference datasets to examine if A/T-content alone could be detected by positional frequency disequilibrium (Table 2). Most of these T/A-rich
hexanucleotides have regions in their respective distribution curves that differed by more than 4 times the standard deviation from their average background deviation
depending on the analyzed dataset. Nearly all of the
examined motifs were relatively enriched in the A. thaliana and D. melanogaster datasets rooted with the TSS as
well as in the ATG-rooted set of D. melanogaster (Table 2).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/522

In the single dataset of S. cerevisiae rooted to the ATG, 33
motifs still matched our stringent criteria, while in the corresponding A. thaliana set only 15 TA-hexanucleotides differed from their background frequency significantly. We
found 29 different TA-permutations in both C. elegans
datasets which were more frequent than their respective
background model (Table 2). This varying enrichment of
T/A-rich motifs can possibly be explained by different single nucleotide compositions close to the TSS or the ATG
[see Additional File 3]. One other reason for the differences found might be the number of contributing
sequences per dataset, as pointed out before.
However, many of these T/A-rich motifs exhibit significant enrichment, yet specific motifs have more significant
tendencies than others, indicating a stronger positional
bias. Among the most significant hexanucleotides in all
organisms except for C. elegans, are the well known TATAbox elements TATAAA and TATATA (Table 2), which
dominate the significance index. Additionally, the
ATATAA-motif, which possibly overlaps with either of
these TATA-box elements, was relatively enriched in the S.
cerevisiae, D. melanogaster and C. elegans promoters. The
TSS dataset for C. elegans did not reveal any of those
motifs, but is rich in AATTTT or TAATTT (Table 2), which
is consistent with its mononucleotide frequency profile
(Additional File 4).
Hence, we can conclude that the motif analysis using frequency distribution maps from bulk sequence clearly
identifies DNA-motifs containing various amounts of significant information. As we were able to validate previously characterized elements, we are convinced that this
method of analysis gives important novel information on
sequence data, as long as the amount of annotated
genome sequence exceeds a certain minimal number of
promoter sequences. We believe this threshold of a critical
number of sequences will be specific for each organism.
Hexanucleotide analysis with motif distribution curves in
eukaryote promoters
We next took an unbiased approach to validate the quality
of the datasets and the value of our approach. Therefore,
we expanded our analysis and conducted motif distribution maps for all 4096 hexanucleotides. First, the three
TSS rooted datasets from Arabidopsis thaliana, Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster were examined
independently of the ATG rooted sets. Initially, the resulting 24576 frequency distribution maps were inspected for
motifs that exhibit behavior signatures implying functional significance near the TSS or the ATG. In general, the
majority of hexanucleotide motifs show non-variant
background behavior in sequence upstream of -600 bp
from the respective roots. This proves that the majority of
sequence variation, and hence putatively encoded infor-

Motif distribution curves were conducted for TATA-box like motifs and searched for frequency disequilibria that exceed a ≥ 4 fold SD from the
average. The fold SD differences over the background frequency at the position of the highest peak are given for each of the permutations [see
Additional File 10]. Background average and SD were calculated as described in the material and methods. The table is sorted according to the fold
differences found in the Arabidopsis promoters.

mation, is detectable near the TSS or the ATG. It is interesting to note that this observation had been made earlier
[17,29,30].
In contrast to the previous, more direct analysis of the
functional TATA-box sequences where 4 times the standard deviation was significant, we needed to obtain overrepresented hexanucleotide motifs with more than 6
times standard deviation from the average background
distribution, based on the varying background frequencies. This can be explained by a large number of rare or
infrequent motifs that incapacitate the identification of

disequilibria based on the evaluation of background
standard deviations alone. There are 585 hexanucleotide
motifs relatively enriched in the A. thaliana TSS dataset,
343 in the set of D. melanogaster and 328 in that one of C.
elegans (Figure 4). In the ATG rooted datasets 729 motifs
were overrepresented for A. thaliana, 604 and 329 for C.
elegans and D. melanogaster, respectively.
It is noteworthy, that the number of motifs differing in the
two sets was higher in the set rooted with the ATG. While
the number of significantly enriched hexanucleotides
identified for D. melanogaster did not change drastically,

BMC Bioinformatics 2006, 7:522

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/522

there are 1.8 fold and 1.2 fold more motifs for C. elegans
and A. thaliana, in the ATG datasets compared to the TSS
datasets, respectively (Figure 4). This might be explained
by the presence of more putatively functional motifs in
the 5'UTR regions of C. elegans and A. thaliana, implying
an important and possibly underestimated regulatory
function for the UTRs in these species.

Table 3 gives a closer insight into the 18 motifs overrepresented in the sets rooted with the TSS of the three organisms compared with the ATG rooted set of S. cerevisiae.
Besides T/A-rich motifs like the previously studied TATAlike motifs, the hexanucleotides CATTTT and TCACAC
differed most with respect to their background frequencies and constitute putative functional CREs conserved in
the promoters of all eukaryotes. It is noteworthy that both
motifs, CATTTT and TCACAC, have recently been found
to have a function in several animal promoters, including
humans [31,32].

Although about 8 % to 10 % of the possible 4096 hexanucleotides were motifs relatively enriched over the background frequency, only 18 were found to be commonly
overrepresented in a promoter specific manner in the
three TSS sets of all three species. In the corresponding sets
rooted for the translation start codon (ATG), 35 common
hexanucleotides were overrepresented in the promoter of
A. thaliana, D. melanogaster and C. elegans.

Similarly, among the 35 motifs more frequent in the ATG
rooted datasets, the TATAAA motif of the TATA-box is
enriched in the promoters of all organisms (Table 4). Four
motifs contain the TCAG-motif present in the transcription initiation sites studied in the beginning of this work.
Besides A-rich sequences, six hexanucleotides exhibiting a
TCAA-core sequence pattern and two a palindromic
TGCA-core motif, both of unknown function in eukaryotes, were found in the list of significant hexamers (Table
4).

To our surprise, none of the 18 motifs found in the TSS
sets overlapped with any of those 35 hexanucleotides
enriched in the datasets of the ATG (Figure 4), which in
turn suggests that the datasets may contain different noncoding regulatory sequences. To get a preliminary insight
into the hexanucleotide composition of S. cerevisiae promoters, we compared the ATG rooted dataset with the
motifs shared in the promoters of the three previous
organisms. Of the 18 motifs relatively enriched in the TSS
datasets, 11 were also significantly enriched in the set
from S. cerevisiae. Of the 35 motifs overrepresented in the
ATG rooted sets, 18 were more frequent in the yeast dataset (Figure 4).

This analysis clearly identified several motifs that were not
previously known to be conserved in promoters across
organism kingdoms. Moreover, it proves the universal
applicability of motif distribution curves for gathering
useful positional information on promoter sequences.

Motif distribution curves of known CREs from eukaryotes
As the TATA-box constitutes a conserved functional motif,
we were interested to expand this study and discover
whether other known functional cis-regulatory elements
also form positional peaks that could be investigated by
using motif distribution curves. Therefore, we retrieved
functional CREs in sense and anti-sense orientation from
literature or public databases for transcription factor binding sites.

We were able to analyze 450 motifs from A. thaliana, 51
for S. cerevisiae and 87 for both, D. melanogaster and C. elegans, (Table 5; see Additional File 5) in their respective
promoter datasets with the idea to explore whether or not
known functional CREs other than known core-promoter
elements can be identified using motif distribution analy-

sis. Here as well, we expected a high variability in frequency amongst the different CREs and, hence, applied a
significance cutoff for a positional disequilibrium of ≥ 6
SD difference from the background average for our automated analysis. Rare motifs, with a background average of
≤ 1, were excluded. Taking into account that some of the
boxes only function unidirectionally, for example the
TATA-box, we scanned the promoter datasets for every
CRE in both orientations. We found that at least 14,94 %
of the known functional CREs do exhibit a significant
positional disequilibrium matching our criteria (Table 5).
The only exception was the TSS rooted set of C. elegans
with only 8 % of positional enrichment of CREs. This
might again be explained by the formation of multigene
operons in Caenorhabditis [27] or the limited amount of
promoter sequence. In total, we observe that depending

on the organism or the dataset investigated 8 % to 50 %
of the putatively functional CREs were enriched at a
defined position (Table 5). Besides T- or A-rich CREs, we
found a significant increase in frequency for several motifs
with a higher GC-content in both the TSS and the ATG
rooted datasets. In about half the cases of a CRE showing
a positional enrichment in any of the datasets, it was orientation dependent (Table 5). Other known functional
core-promoter elements like the DPE, BRE or the MTE
[24,25,55] analyzed with datasets that extend over the
transcription start sites could be detected only in Drosophila but not in the other species studied here (data not
shown). Since the BRE and MTE are known to be enriched
in TATA-less promoters [24], it may be worth performing
a similar analysis with TATA-containing and TATA-less
promoter datasets once more TSS information is available.
Although we have identified significantly enriched CREs
with a positional disequilibrium on the basis of the peak
height, valuable information is still retained in the frequency-distribution map of each motif, such as the
breadth of enrichment.
Since it is impossible to depict frequency distribution
curves for all CREs, we have randomly chosen two per
organism that do not represent known core-promoter elements from our list of significant CREs for presentation
(Figure 5). In the following paragraphs, we describe these
examples in more detail.
A. thaliana
The 450 CREs for Arabidopsis were derived from the Plant
cis-acting regulatory DNA elements (PLACE) database
[14,56]. The GGCCCAWWW motif was found in genes
induced after decapitating the inflorescences and might be
a CRE for wound stress response and the initiation of axil-

lary bud outgrowth in Arabidopsis [33]. The TGTCTC
motif is known as the DR5-element and represents the
binding consensus for the Auxin Response Factor 1
(ARF1) found in promoters of early auxin responsive
genes [34]. This CRE is used as an important reporter element in a synthetic promoter to trace developmental
processes in which the phytohormone auxin is involved
[35-37]. Interestingly, the synthetic promoter contains a
multimeric repeat of the TGTCTC consensus at a similar
position where we identified a relative enrichment of this
motif in our distribution curves.
S. cerevisiae
The 51 CREs for yeast were derived from the promoter
database SCPD [38,57]. The CGTnnnnnnYGA motif represents the binding consensus for ABF1 [39]. The second
motif, CGGGTRR, constitutes the binding motif for the
REB1 protein [40]. Interestingly, both proteins are multifunctional, site-specific DNA-binding proteins that act in
concert in many biological processes and are both
involved in preventing gene expression at the silencing
mating-type locus [41,42]. A positional enrichment of the
binding consensi for both transcription factors about 100
to 200 bp upstream the ATG is congruent with their function as general regulatory factors at the transcription initiation site [43].

Since no specific CRE databases exist for C. elegans and D.
melanogaster, we retrieved 87 CREs primarily from literature and textbook sources [see Additional File 5].
C. elegans
The BBTATWTWD consensus was identified in a phylogenetic footprint approach to form a regulatory module,
which confers a muscle-specific gene expression [44]. The
YTTCCTY motif is the binding consensus of ETS-transcription factors [45], which are associated with several physi-

Figure 5 of frequency distribution curves of known cis-regulatory elements (CREs)
Examples
Examples of frequency distribution curves of known cis-regulatory elements (CREs). Two randomly chosen examples for CREs that possess positional disequilibria were shown for each of the model organisms. Known functional cis-regulatory elements of the three kingdoms (animals, fungi and plants) were taken from Table 5. Relative number of motifs per site (in
percent) was mapped to their respective position. The grey box indicates the region used to calculate the background average
and its SD. For raw values of the illustrated examples see Additional File 13.

ological and pathological processes. They contribute to
the regulation of gene expression during the maturation
of hematopoietic cell lineages and in tumor cell growth
D. melanogaster
The CAGCTG motif is known as the palindromic GC-box
and represents a binding consensus conserved in 502 RNA
polymerase II promoter regions [46]. The HGATAR motif
was chosen as it was relatively enriched in Drosophila promoters, although it was described as a binding site for
mesoderm specific MED1 GATA-factor in C. elegans [47].
This conforms to the idea that some cis-elements are conserved over large evolutionary distances and that our
approach can identify such putatively functional motifs in
eukaryote genome comparison approaches. For example,
GAGA-like elements were first described in Drosophila and
have recently been found to be functional elements in
plants as well [48,49].

Conclusion
It was proposed that the TATA-box was the only functional motif shared in the promoters between eukaryotes
of different kingdoms [11] based solely on a frequency
derived background model. Instead, our analysis has
shown several highly conserved motifs besides TATA-box
like patterns common in the promoter sequences flanking
the TSS or the translation start codon ATG even amongst
distantly related species.
Genome wide promoter analysis with frequency distribution maps expands our knowledge of the core promoter
and the majority of known functional CREs. It has long
been known that the mere presence of an element does
not necessarily result in its functionality with respect to
transcriptional regulation [5,6]. Hence, existing database
information on CREs is valuable resource, i.e the PLACE
collection of plant CREs [14] or the SCPD for yeast [38],

but without positional information one could not reach
any definite conclusion as to the significance of its putative functionality. With the information on positional
enrichment of a motif or a known functional CRE it is
possible to get a more detailed insight into where an element appears to function. This in turn might accelerate
the in depth examination of regulatory sequences in the
laboratory.

changes and modifications made to the script code and
package composition. Script version numbers mentioned
refer to the individual script version number regardless of
the package version which can be found in the beginning
of each script file. Additionally, any older versions that
have been replaced during package updates can be readily
obtained upon request. Detailed descriptions accompany
the package at its webpage.

It has been shown that essential cis-regulatory modules
exist in Drosophila melanogaster that control gene expression from a distance of several kilobases [50]. Nonetheless, we identify functionally important motifs to be
located close to the TSS or the ATG. Whether such modules effect transcription via chromatin remodeling and
nucleosome positioning, rather than a direct influence on
the transcriptional machinery, remains to be examined.

from the Entrez Plant Genomes Central at NCBI [59] for
Arabidopsis thaliana [GenBank: NC_003070.5, GenBank:

GenBank: NC_003284.3.gbk]. Each chromosome
sequence was extracted to an additional file using the
SeqGBComplie v1.2 script.

On the basis of the average position of the TATA-box in
the ATG rooted dataset, it also became evident that the
5'UTRs of different species can be of similar sizes, as was
published before [see Additional File 2, [23]]. Moreover,
some sequence pattern might be positionally enriched in
the 5'UTR, implying an important and possibly underestimated regulatory function, but information on these
kinds of elements is rare and needs more experimental
investigation.
We concentrated on motifs which have maxima. But during this work, it became evident that motifs exist, which
exhibit significant positional minima in the frequency distribution curves. Perhaps a detailed investigation of them
could also contribute to our current understanding of
gene regulation.
As our analysis was carried out on regular personal computers and the scripts were written in the Visual Basic
script language, the analysis can be performed inexpensively and freely adopted or modified to suit specific
needs. The universal applicability of our method and the
simplicity of the background model used is a clear advantage of the presented approach. The use of motif distribution curves will greatly enhance the quality of the
identification of novel promoter motifs, as many of the
known functional CREs appear to be relatively enriched at
defined sites near the core promoter region.

Methods
Motif mapper
The vast majority of the developed scripts mentioned in
this work have been deposited in the Motif Mapper opensource script collection first released online in 2004 [58].
The Motif Mapper package is routinely maintained and
up-dated at its web site, so that only the current version is
available. A history file is available, documenting all

Upstream regions rooted to the annotated transcription
start site (TSS) or the translation start site (ATG) were
extracted and compiled to FASTA formatted text with the
aGenBankSQL script v3.3.4, using the default code modification suggested in the Motif Mapper website when
extracting the TSS rooted datasets. This code modification
only extracts promoters from genes that have an annotated or predicted 5'UTR. In cases where several TSS or
ATG are annotated, the routines were adjusted in such a
way that only the first annotation was recognized resulting in only one extracted sequence contributing to the
promoter datasets. For each genome, the individual
pseudo-molecule promoter datasets (i.e. each FASTA file
per chromosome) were assembled into one file using the
TxtFileFuse v1.2 script. Thereafter, frequency distribution
curves were created for each motif by first combining the
established promoter datasets with the StackerNtrimmer
v.3.2.2 script to create the input files needed for the enumerating script REG_Pro_Point_Mapper v3.4.0. The
number of extracted promoters is: At ATG 26299; At TSS
16997; Dm ATG 10671; Dm TSS 7953; Ce ATG 19179; Ce

TSS 885; and Sc ATG 5361. A flowchart of the extraction
and analysis is given as Additional File 4.
Frequency analysis of motifs
The REG_Pro_Point_Mapper algorithm identifies nonoverlapping motifs in each promoter from 5' to 3' orientation and records the position of the motif in its respective position in the promoter. Each sequence is searched
independently and hits at the same position in two promoters are added together. A hexanucleotide hit is
recorded as 111111. Two overlapping hexamer motifs at
identical positions in two different sequences result in
222222; hence, hexanucleotide motifs which overlap in
their respective position by only one nucleotide in two
different promoters are recorded as 11111211111. Using
this approach, we eliminated the need for a transformation to catch elements that have partial overlaps. Furthermore, simple smoothing algorithms tend to destroy the
positional information in biological sequences (unpublished data). This is particularly evident when a motif, e.g.
the translation start codon "ATG", is tightly positioned
with respect to a biologically functional location within
the DNA strand. Hence, models that average over a word
size larger than the motif itself lose this positional information. Therefore, no smoothing operations have been
applied to the data.
Frequency distribution curves
Frequency distribution curves were conducted on the textfile ".psum" output of REG_Pro_Point_Mapper v3.4.0
with regular spread sheet analysis programs. For each
rooted dataset the raw number of motifs was plotted in
respect to their exact position. As all sets used in this analysis were either rooted to the transcription start site (TSS)
or the translation initiation codon ATG, all curves were
drawn with the root pointing to the right.
Detection of significant change in positional disequilibria
Automatically evaluated motif distribution curves were
searched for frequency disequilibria that exceed a defined
fold standard deviation (SD) from the average occurrence.
We used the first 1000 bps (-1494 bp to -494 bp) from the
1500 bp promoter sets to derive the background average,
or the entire data set for all smaller datasets. The average
background frequency constitutes the background model.
We then calculated the standard deviation for each motif
by using the following equation:

SD =

∑ (xi − x )2
(n − 1)

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/522

Assuming that motifs are equally distributed apart from
any positional disequilibrium, we decided to use a simple
significance cutoff frequency according to Arkhipova [20],
defined as ≥ 4 SD from the average. Significant deviances
from this average by 4 standard deviations were then used
as a screening parameter to identify peaks and valleys. For
evaluation on the curves for the 4096 hexanucleotides
and known CREs, we introduced a higher cutoff frequency
at ≥ 6 SD than the average of the background model. As
certain motifs differ significantly in their frequencies near
the transcription or translation start sites, but are not
strictly position dependent (e.g. T/A rich motifs), the
length of a significant stretch is recorded as a "gap". The
script pSUMscan v.3.4.0 was written to automatically catalogue the peaks and valleys and gap data with the default
set to 4 standard deviations (SD) above or below the background average; gaps were set to a default length of 25 bp.
This entire automated analysis performed by the pSUMscan script can also be manually done in common spread
sheet analysis programs.
Cis-regulatory Elements (CREs)
Known CREs were retrieved using the well maintained
databases PLACE ([56]; 450 elements) for plant motifs
and SCPD ([57]; 51 elements) for motifs from Saccharomyces. In order to gather CREs for Drosophila or Caenorhabditis, literature describing various eukaryotic cis-elements
was collected and catalogued into a list of 87 elements.
This list carries the original description of the cis-element,
the IUPAC conversion used in this work and the original
reference source describing the element. Apart from palindromes, we conducted motif distribution curves for sense
and the antisense orientation of the motifs independently. The list of cis-elements used from PLACE, SCPD
and other eukaryotes is found in Additional File 5.
Motif permutations
All possible permutations of the hexamers TATAAA and
TATATA for each nucleotide were generated with the
MAIN_AllCombinations v.3.4.1 script. Antisense motifs
were generated by the MAIN_List_w_RevComps v.1.2
routine and all redundant motifs were removed with the
script MAIN_ClearRedundancy v.1.2.
Shared motifs
Shared motifs were identified by conducting text file lists
of overrepresented motifs for each dataset. The list content
was compared using the SetGrouping script to identify
shared motifs in both lists. Details can be found in Additional File 6.
