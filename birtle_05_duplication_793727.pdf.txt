Abstract
Background: The physiological and phenotypic differences between human and chimpanzee are
largely specified by our genomic differences. We have been particularly interested in recent
duplications in the human genome as examples of relatively large-scale changes to our genome. We
performed an in-depth evolutionary analysis of a region of chromosome 1, which is copy number
polymorphic among humans, and that contains at least 32 PRAME (Preferentially expressed antigen
of melanoma) genes and pseudogenes. PRAME-like genes are expressed in the testis and in a large
number of tumours, and are thought to possess roles in spermatogenesis and oogenesis.
Results: Using nucleotide substitution rate estimates for exons and introns, we show that two
large segmental duplications, of six and seven human PRAME genes respectively, occurred in the
last 3 million years. These duplicated genes are thus hominin-specific, having arisen in our genome
since the divergence from chimpanzee. This cluster of PRAME genes appears to have arisen initially
from a translocation approximately 95–85 million years ago. We identified multiple sites within
human or mouse PRAME sequences which exhibit strong evidence of positive selection. These form
a pronounced cluster on one face of the predicted PRAME protein structure.
Conclusion: We predict that PRAME genes evolved adaptively due to strong competition between
rapidly-dividing cells during spermatogenesis and oogenesis. We suggest that as PRAME gene copy
number is polymorphic among individuals, positive selection of PRAME alleles may still prevail within
the human population.

Background
Humans and chimpanzees shared a common ancestor
approximately 6–7 million years ago (MYA) [1]. Distinguishing characteristics, such as those relating to cognitive
abilities, language, habitual upright gait, dentition, and
susceptibility to malaria, are all assumed to be associated
with genetic differences between these two species [2].
However, these phenotypic differences have been associated with specific human-chimpanzee sequence differ-

ences in fewer than a handful of cases. In humans, two
coding changes in FOXP2 have been proposed to contribute to language acquisition [3], disruption in the MYH16
myosin heavy chain gene is proposed to have led to a
reduction in masticatory muscles [4], and the pseudogenisation of a type I hair keratin has been associated with
modifications in our hair keratin phenotype [5]

It is also unclear at which developmental stages, and in
which tissues, such human-specific adaptations are first
manifested. For example, the abnormal spindle-like microcephaly-associated (ASPM) gene has roles in mitosis, meiosis and cytokinesis, and is broadly expressed in many
tissues. Yet it is a major determinant of cerebral cortical
size [6] and has evolved adaptively in recent hominin evolution (reviewed in Ponting & Jackson (2005))[7]. As the
signatures of recent adaptation are identified in the
human genome it will be important to associate these
DNA changes with molecular, cellular and physiological
innovation.
With the sequencing of the human and chimpanzee
genomes comes the possibility of discerning nucleotide
changes that have been acquired adaptively and thus
might be associated with physiological innovation [2].
Two factors, however, often confound such studies. First,
the scarcity of substitutions (~1% [8,9]) between human
and chimpanzee orthologous coding sequence provides
insufficient statistical power to distinguish adaptive from
neutral substitutions. Second, the chimpanzee genome
has been sequenced only to low coverage (4-fold statistical coverage for panTro1; see [10]). As a result, the chimpanzee genome sequence contains many gaps, sequence
inaccuracies and assembly artefacts. Such problems are
exacerbated in regions containing identical or almost
identical tandem segments which pose particular problems for both sequencing and assembly. Juxtaposed and
virtually identical sequences are frequently represented
either by only single versions in genome assemblies, or are
absent altogether, thereby giving rise to gaps in the
assembly.
By contrast, the human genome assembly is virtually complete and is accurate to approximately one error every 105
bases [11]. The human sequence's high statistical coverage
gives rise to an assembly that is a mosaic of contributions
from multiple individuals and thus does not represent
any single genome. This mosaicism is less important for
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) than it is for
larger-scale polymorphisms, such as copy number polymorphisms (CNPs). This is because most SNPs are selectively neutral whereas the evidence suggests that this
appears not to be the case for CNPs [12].
Identifying sequence changes that distinguish human and
chimpanzee physiology, development and behaviour is a
challenge not only because of errors and polymorphisms
in genome assemblies, but also because the very types of
sequence differences that contribute most to these characteristics remain ill-determined. The near-identity of
human and chimpanzee orthologous coding sequence led
to an initial suggestion that gene expression, rather than
coding sequence change, is the major contributor to our

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/120

differences [13]. However, it has become clear that most
of the variations between human and chimpanzee in noncoding sequence are not adaptive either [14]. Identifying
adaptive substitutions, whether in coding or non-coding
sequence, remains a considerable problem.
Our approach has been not to investigate single nucleotide substitutions as potential substrates of adaptation.
Rather, we wish to consider larger sequence differences
between human and chimpanzee genomes, namely genes
which have duplicated in a lineage-specific manner in the
past 6–7 MY since the last common ancestor of the two
species.
To this end, we recently determined the number of synonymous (silent) mutations per synonymous site (KS)
between closely-related human genes and used this to predict the lineage-specificity of duplication events. We identified a relatively large fraction (5%) of human genes that
have participated in duplication events since the last common ancestor with the rodents [11]. Gene pairs that
together have accumulated few substitutions in synonymous sites (KS < 0.3) were suggested to be primate-specific. The vast majority of these paralogues pairs have
accumulated even fewer silent substitutions (KS < 0.015),
indicating that most human duplications occurred only in
the past 3–4 million years, after the divergence of Homo
and Pan lineages. It is not yet known whether these recent
duplications in the mosaic human genome assembly are
fixed in the human population, or instead represent
CNPs, although the latter explanation now appears
increasingly likely [15]. The functions of these recentlyduplicated genes are not uniformly distributed. Genes
involved in reproduction, chemosensation and host
defense and immunity are over-represented [11]. 'Cancer
Testis antigen' (CTA) genes, most of which are normally
expressed in the testis but are also highly active in certain
cancers [16], are another prominent category among the
recently-duplicated human gene set. They are represented
among a small number of gene families, including one
whose founding member is PRAME ('Preferentially
expressed antigen of melanoma'), a human gene that is
expressed highly in a large proportion of tumours [17,18].
In all cases, the physiological role of CTA genes in normal
cells remains unclear, but their recent and extensive duplications are consistent with adaptive functions, such as
chemosensation, immunity and reproduction [19]. Moreover, their specific expression in the testis and ovary
argues for their involvement in the acquisition of innovative reproductive function during recent primate
evolution.
CTA genes frequently have been duplicated on the human
X chromosome [11,20] which might indicate a male selective advantage in possessing these genes. A mouse

Page 2 of 19

BMC Genomics 2005, 6:120

PRAME-like X-linked gene is known to be expressed specifically in spermatogonia, and may perform roles in the
early stages of spermatogenesis [21]. Other members of
this family are clustered together on an autosome, mouse
chromosome 4. Because mammalian sex chromosomes
undergo inactivation in late stages of spermatogenesis, it
is possible that X-linked PRAME genes may play a part
early in spermatogenesis, whereas the cluster of autosomal PRAME genes functions either in later stages, or in
other tissues. Indeed, one autosomal mouse PRAME-like
gene is known to be expressed in both oocytes and early
cleavage-stage embryos [22].
Here we describe the extraordinary recent evolution of
autosomal PRAME-like gene clusters on human and chimpanzee chromosomes 1, and mouse chromosome 4. We
use a molecular clock, calibrated using synonymous or
intronic nucleotide substitutions, to infer the recent origin
of many of these PRAME genes. This is corroborated independently by comparison with available chimpanzee
genomic sequence. Our analyses confirm that these
human genes have duplicated unusually rapidly within
the last 3 MY, with concomitant and substantial sequence
diversification resulting from adaptive evolution. We predict that the differences between human and chimpanzee
PRAME genes contributed to the functional divergence
along the hominin lineage.

Results
Evolutionary survey of 7 human CT-Antigen gene families
We investigated whether rapidly-duplicating members of
seven CTA families have experienced rapid sequence
diversification as a result of adaptive evolution. Using
ENSEMBL gene predictions, we initially used codeml [23]
to predict sites in their amino acid alignments that have
been subject to positive selection. Only 2 of the 7 families,
namely the PRAME genes and SSX-like genes, were predicted to contain positively-selected sites (posterior probabilities > 0.9 for each of three model pairs (see
Methods)). Because of its large size and because of the
large number (23) of positively-selected sites found in an
initial analysis (using the NCBI34 genome assembly (data
not shown)), we decided to perform a more comprehensive analysis of PRAME genes and pseudogenes in human,
chimpanzee and mouse genomes; the human SSX-like
family contains only 7 members, for which 6 positivelyselected sites were predicted (data not shown).
Recent origin for the PRAME gene cluster
We then investigated whether PRAME genes, located
between RefSeq genes DHRS3 and T1A-2 on HSA1, are
present in orthologous locations in other vertebrates.
Indeed, the mouse genome contains PRAME-like genes in
its orthologous region [24], as does the rat genome. However, the orthologous regions of both dog and chicken

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/120

genome assemblies possess no PRAME homologous
genes, as determined by searches of these regions using
TBlastn [25]. Moreover, this region of the dog genome
assembly contains no clone gaps and insufficiently large
(≥ 2.5 kb) fragment gaps to accommodate any missing
dog PRAME genes. As humans and rodents shared a more
recent common ancestor than either humans and dogs, or
humans and chickens, it thus appears likely that one or
more PRAME genes were translocated into this genomic
location after the divergence with the Laurasiatherian lineage containing extant carnivores (approximately 95
MYA), but before the rodent-primate split (approximately
85 MYA) [26].
Human, chimpanzee and mouse PRAME genes
Our comprehensive reprediction of human PRAME
homologues from the 0.74 Mb region of HSA1 yielded a
total of 22 PRAME genes and 10 pseudogenes (Figure 1).
(These we number sequentially along the assembly,
Homo_1, Homo_2, etc.) Each of these genes is approximately 3.0 kb long (average 3069 bases), contain three
exons (labelled A, B and C) and two introns (a and b)
both with consensus (GT-AG) splice sites. The translated
protein is approximately 474 amino acids in length with
the three exons having median lengths of 95, 193 and 186
amino acids.

Initial predictions of chimpanzee PRAME genes, from
placed and unplaced PTR1 sequence and from unmapped
assembled sequence, yielded 17 candidate genes. Careful
inspection, however, revealed these gene predictions to be
of poor quality with many predicted genes spanning suspiciously large (>> 3 kb) genomic distances and exhibiting regions of poor sequence similarity. We believe this is
a result of the sequence incompleteness and the low (4fold) statistical coverage of the chimpanzee genome
sequence in the assembly. We thus instead resorted to
independently predicting each of the three chimpanzee
PRAME exons. This resulted in 16 exon A, 24 exon B and
19 exon C predictions. Several of these predictions appear
to be identical and could thus be redundant. Adjacent
exons and introns were assembled to give 12 putative
chimpanzee PRAME genes and pseudogenes (labelled
Pan_1, Pan_2 etc.), all of whose introns were confirmed to
contain consensus (GT-AG) splice sites. Of these predictions, only 3 appear to be full length, with 3 exons and 2
introns lacking gaps. 30 predictions contain a single exon
only. 7 of the 12 sequences contain 3 stop codons and 12
frameshifts, and so might be pseudogenes. (At suggested
nucleotide substitution rate of 3 × 10-4 and insertion/deletion error rates of approximately 2 × 10-4 (Tarjei
Mikkelsen, personal communication) we expect few if any
of these disruptions to arise from sequencing errors (data
not shown)).

We inferred relationships between chimpanzee exons and
intron, and their human orthologous sequences, using
phylogenetic trees (see below). This revealed both well
assembled chimpanzee sequence, with consecutive exons
and introns assigned to the same human orthologous
gene, and poorly assembled sequences, manifested by
short contigs, separated by gaps, in a disordered
arrangement.
18 PRAME-like genes and 15 pseudogenes were predicted
in the orthologous region of mouse chromosome 4.
(These are numbered sequentially Mus_1, Mus_2 etc., in
the same orientation as that used for the human and
chimpanzee numbering scheme.) Of these 5 (Mus_1,
Mus_9, Mus_10, Mus_18 and Mus_30) have previously
been investigated by Dade et al. [24], who describe these
as having roles in oogenesis.
Local gene duplication
In order to visualise the chromosomal landscape of this
region of HSA1, we compared its repeat-masked DNA
sequence with itself using a dotplot representation (Figure
1). As befits tandemly-duplicated and highly similar
sequence, a strong pattern of many diagonals was evident.
Each short diagonal represents the DNA alignment of two
PRAME genes or pseudogenes. The orientation of the
diagonal indicates whether these two genes or pseudogenes are situated on the same, or else the opposite,
strand. We observed two pairs of long diagonals (highlighted in colour in Figure 1) which represent two predicted events of segmental duplication (see below).
Human and mouse PRAME genes are monophyletic
We then were able to exploit these gene predictions from
human, chimpanzee and mouse to infer the genes' evolutionary relationships and the sequential order of gene
duplications. At this stage, we do not rule out that paralogous sequences have been subject to recent inter-locus
gene conversion [27,28] which may result in greater
sequence similarity and, hence, an apparently more recent
date of evolutionary divergence (see Discussion). Dendrograms were constructed from two types of quasi-neutral
nucleotide substitution rates: KS values, either for single
coding exons, or for complete coding sequence, and KI
values, defined as the numbers of nucleotide substitutions
per site within intronic sequence.

A phylogenetic tree constructed from human and mouse
PRAME gene KS values revealed that mouse sequences are
monophyletic, as are human sequences (Figure 2). No
pair of mouse and human PRAME genes thus possesses a
simple 1:1 orthology relationship. This is a striking result
since the vast majority (approximately 80%) of mouse
genes possess a single human ortholog [29]. As predicted
earlier [11], many human PRAME genes thus have arisen

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/120

by duplication recently in the primate lineage. What was
unexpected, however, is that all mouse, and similarly all
human, PRAME sequences have arisen by duplication
events that occurred since their last common ancestor,
approximately 85 MYA.
Human PRAME genes have frequently and recently
duplicated
Three further phylogenetic trees compared human and
chimpanzee KS values from alignments of each of the
three PRAME exons (Figure 3; Additional Information).
Each of these trees indicates that PRAME gene sequence
duplicated frequently in the terminal human branch (i.e.
the lineage from the common ancestor of humans and
chimpanzees to humans).

Importantly, many pairs of human PRAME genes, and
their constituent exons (Figure 3) and introns (Figure 4),
were found to exhibit low synonymous rates (Figure 5)
that are more typical of duplications in the terminal
human branch, than they are of duplications that
occurred prior to the common ancestor of humans and
chimpanzees, approximately 6–7 MYA [1]. Later in the
manuscript we return to the issue of whether these
recently-duplicated human genes are present or absent
from the chimpanzee genome.
Assignment of human paralogues and chimpanzee
orthologues
By testing for congruency among the three exon (KS) and
the two intron (KI) trees (Figures 3 and 4; Additional
Information Files 1, 2, 3) we were able to identify the closest human paralogue to each human PRAME gene. The set
of assignments was found to be unambiguous and internally consistent, with one notable exception: Homo_15
and Homo_12 are almost identical in their first two exons
but are divergent in their exons C. Upon closer inspection
it appears that either genome assembly error has generated a chimaeric Homo_12 gene, or else its exon C and a
portion of intron b, have been subjected to inter-locus
gene conversion with an, as yet unknown, PRAME homologue. Consequently, in subsequent evolutionary rate calculations, comparisons between exons C from Homo_12
and Homo_15 have been discarded. All human PRAME
genes, with only 4 exceptions (Homo_1, Homo_3, Homo_5
and Homo_13), are little diverged (KS < 0.1 or KI < 0.1; Figure 5) from another human gene, and are thus part of a
pair of sequence similar paralogues which have apparently been generated by a recent gene duplication.

A similar protocol was adopted to identify chimpanzee
orthologues of human PRAME exons and introns. For
each human exon (or intron), we assigned as its orthologue the chimpanzee exon (or intron) with the lowest KS
(or KI) value from the tree, whilst checking to see that

Scatter plot of the lowest neutral rate estimates (either KS calculated from exon, or KI for intron, alignments)
for human PRAME genes and either their human paralogues (indicated in red) or their chimpanzee orthologues (indicated in black). Circles represent averages of intronic rate (KI) estimates, whereas squares represent averages
of exonic rate (KS) estimates. The horizontal axis represents genomic location within a 0.74 Mb region of human chromosome
1 (see Figure 1). Two recent segmental duplications (Homo_7–12 and 15–20, and Homo_19–25 and 26–32; see text) are highlighted in blue and pink, respectively. The dark line represents the median KS value (3.58 × 10-3) for human paralogues. The grey
band identifies 25–75% of this median value (second and third quartiles). The blue line represents the median KS (0.011) for
human-chimpanzee coding sequence [30, 31]. The exonic KS value for Homo_12 vs Homo_15 is not shown due to incongruencies in KS-derived phylogenetic trees (see text). Homo-Pan rate estimates are missing when the most-closely related sequences,
that are available, are relatively divergent KI or KS > 0.1. These missing values are likely to reflect the incompleteness of the current chimpanzee genome assembly. Homo-Homo rate estimates are missing for 4 genes (Homo_1, 3, 5 and 13) which appear
not to have duplicated recently (KI or KS > 0.1).

these values were approximately 0.011, the median KS
value between chimpanzee and human orthologues
[30,31]. This process resulted in at least one orthology

assignment to the exons or introns of all but 9 (Homo_4,
Homo_6, Homo_10, Homo_14, Homo_17, Homo_21,
Homo_25, Homo_28, and Homo_32) of the human PRAME

homologues; these missing orthologues can be assumed
to be present in the chimpanzee genome but absent from
its current assembly. For each human orthologue, we then
examined the chimpanzee genome assembly for
contiguity of its assigned chimpanzee orthologous exons
and introns. For example, Pan_1_A, Pan_2_B and
Pan_3_C, which are the chimpanzee orthologues of the
three exons of Homo_1, appear consecutively within the
chimpanzee genome sequence, complete with intervening intronic sequence, and thus were assigned as a full
length chimpanzee PRAME, Pan_1. Several chimpanzee
orthologue exon pairs appeared not to be contiguous in
the current assembly, which again indicates that considerable additional data and attention will be required to provide an accurate assembly of this region.
Pseudogenes
Of 32 HSA1 PRAME homologues, 10 are predicted to be
pseudogenes. A similar proportion of chimpanzee PRAME
exons are disrupted by at least one stop codon: 19 (3 exon
A, 7 exon B and 9 exon C) out of 59 chimpanzee predicted
exons contain at least one such disruption. It is probable
that some of these are due merely to sequencing or assembly errors due to the low (4-fold) statistical coverage of the
chimpanzee genome.

We can safely infer that at least three of these pseudogenes
(Homo_9, Homo_13, and Homo_18) were present in the
common ancestor to both human and chimpanzee simply because in each case the disruptions coincide between
orthologues. Five human sequences (Homo_3, Homo_11,
Homo_16, Homo_20 and Homo_27) appear to have
become pseudogenes in the hominin lineage as a result of
disruptions which are absent from their chimpanzee
orthologues. Homo_20 and Homo_27, which differ by only
two synonymous substitutions, acquired their disrupting
mutation (a stop codon) only recently, since their divergence from the Homo_7 gene, within the last 1 MY (see
below).
Dating segmental duplications in the human genome
The branching order of human genes, both from exon KSbased trees (Figure 3; Additional Information) and from
intron KI-based trees (Figure 4; Additional Information),
indicates that two large-scale duplication events occurred
recently in a human ancestral genome. The most recent
event appears to have been a single tandem duplication of
7 PRAME homologues to generate a pair of segments
encompassing genes Homo_19–25 and genes Homo_26–
32 (Figure 1; Figure 5).

We can estimate the age of this duplication using the neutral rate estimates as a molecular clock and calibrating this
by the divergence time (6–7 MY) between the human and
chimpanzee lineages (see Figure 3 and Additional Infor-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/120

mation). Previous large-scale studies have shown that the
median KS value between human and chimpanzee orthologues is 0.011 [30,31]. The mean KS value between the
seven Homo_19–32 genes and their assigned orthologues
in chimpanzee was found to be 0.00995. Divergence
between these regions of HSA1 and PTR1 thus is typical of
these genomes as a whole.
We expect, therefore, that pairs of human paralogues possessing KS values less than approximately 0.01 are likely to
have arisen in the terminal human branch, within the past
6–7 MY, whereas human paralogues possessing KS values
greater than 0.01 arose due to duplications that occurred
prior to the divergence of chimpanzee and human lineages. We calculated that the seven least divergent pairs
between Homo_19–25 and Homo_26–32 exhibit a mean
divergence of 1.46 × 10-3 which is nearly seven-fold lower
than the chimpanzee-human divergence. This indicates
an age for this duplication of approximately (1.46 × 10-3 /
9.95 × 10-3) × 6 ≈ 0.9 MY. A similar calculation using
intronic nucleotide substitution rates KI predicts an age of
0.8 MY. As these predicted ages considerably postdate the
split between chimpanzee and human lineages (6–7
MYA), the tandem duplication of Homo_19–25 and
Homo_26–32 genes appears to have been a hominin-specific event.
This conclusion is reinforced by the high identity of
genomic sequence between the two duplications.
Genomic sequences encompassing Homo_19–25 (HSA1
bases 13132294–13272173) and Homo_26–32 (bases
13353079–13493033) PRAME genes are 99.82% identical (161 mismatched bases over ~140 kb). 0.18%
divergence, again, is almost seven-fold lower than 1.23%,
the average divergence between human and chimpanzee
sequence [8,31,32]. This divergence is also twice the average polymorphism rate (0.08%; [11,33,34]) between
human individuals and in the human genome assembly.
This most recent large-scale duplication of human PRAME
genes thus appears to be recent, with respect to the
human-chimpanzee divergence event, but ancient, compared with the appearance of most human polymorphisms, within approximately the last 0.10 MY [35].
A more ancient, but still apparently hominin-specific,
large, segmental and inverted duplication is that of
Homo_7–12 and Homo_15–20 PRAME genes (Figure 1;
Figure 5). This duplication's average divergence (mean KI
= 0.00275; mean KS = 0.00447) is 2.2–3.6-fold smaller
than that expected divergence (≈ 0.010, see above) for
human-chimpanzee comparisons, which corresponds to
an estimated divergence time of between 1.7 and 2.7
MYA. These estimates again considerably postdate the
chimpanzee-human divergence.

Copy number polymorphisms (CNPs)
The recent segmental duplications of human PRAME
genes suggest that this region of HSA1 might contain
CNPs within the human population. By querying the
database of genomic variants [36] we determined that
HSA1p36.21, which encompasses these PRAME genes, is
one of only 11 polymorphic loci found in two large-scale
CNP investigations [12,36,37] (see Figure 1). This implies
that not only has this region undergone two large-scale
duplications in ~ 3 MY, but that there have been additional, more recent, duplications which are not fixed in
the human population and have not been captured in the
human genome reference sequence.
Positive selection of PRAME genes
Gene duplication in a genome provides a substrate upon
which selection may act. The preservation of duplicates
without disruption to their open-reading frames over millennia is itself an indication that these duplicates confer a
selective benefit to the host organism. More direct evidence of positive selection comes from the elevated values
of the ratio of KA, the number of nonsynonymous (amino
acid changing) substitutions per nonsynonymous site, to
KS. After discarding closely-related sequences (KS < 0.02),
the median KA/KS ratio between pairs of human PRAME
genes is 0.73, and 19 gene pairs exhibit KA/KS ratios
greater than 1, with a maximum value of 1.73 between
Homo_6 and Homo_10. These values are considerably
higher than the average ratio between human and rodent
single gene orthologues (median KA/KS~ 0.12) [29].

KA/KS values of approximately 1 might be due to positive
selection of nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions, or
to reduced selective constraints due to the loss of PRAME
genes' functions. In order to distinguish between these
hypotheses, and to further investigate the evolution of
these genes, we used codeml [38-40] to infer positive
selection at single sites within multiple alignments of
human or mouse PRAME genes.
Among human PRAME genes, a large number (30) of
amino acid sites were identified as having been subject to
positive selection. By mapping these sites to a homologous protein structure, that of porcine ribonuclease inhibitor, we observed that these sites aggregate to form a
pronounced cluster on one exterior face (Figure 6). The
majority of these sites would thus be available to participate in binding interactions. A similar analysis of mouse
PRAME genes also demonstrated the impact of positive
selection: 17 positively selected sites were identified, of
which 4 coincide with such sites among human PRAME
genes.

Discussion
Our findings demonstrate an extraordinarily rapid expansion within this PRAME gene family that occurred independently in both primate and rodent lineages. Given the
high conservation of gene order among chicken, dog,
human and rodent genomes, we can date the origin of this
cluster to between approximately 95 and 85 MYA [26].
This is because PRAME homologues are undetectable in
the orthologous region of the chicken and dog genomes,
but are present in syntenic portions of primate and rodent
genomes. Thereafter, many episodes of gene duplication
have occurred in both primate and rodent lineages.
In order to infer the most recent of these duplication
events, we identified 13 pairs of human PRAME paralogues which appear to have arisen by duplication since
the common ancestor with chimpanzees: their divergence
is considerably less than both the expected and the
observed divergence between orthologous human and
chimpanzee sequence (Figure 1 and Figure 5). Using a
molecular clock, and a palaeontological calibration of
divergence between these two species of 6–7 MYA [1], we
estimate that two large segmental duplications of PRAME
genes occurred independently in the terminal human
branch, within approximately the past 3 MY.
The low divergence of these human paralogues, compared
with the divergence between chimpanzee and human
orthologues, argues strongly that chimpanzee lacks single
orthologues of many, if not all, of these human duplicated genes. Insufficient nucleotide substitutions at synonymous and intronic sites have accumulated to indicate
that Homo_7–12 and Homo_15–32 genes were all present
in single copies in the common ancestor of chimpanzee
and human. Even when the chimpanzee genome is
completed, we thus expect that chimpanzee single orthologues of these genes will not be identified.
In addition to these duplications which are apparent in
the human genome assembly, it appears, from two independent studies [36,12], that the region of human chromosome 1 (HSA1) containing these PRAME genes is copy
number polymorphic. These human genes are present in
different numbers among the human population, thus
providing further evidence that human-specific duplications are a feature of this region. CNPs are thought not to
be selectively neutral [12]. Their persistence in the human
population suggests, rather, that at least a subset of CNPs
may be adaptive.
In support of this hypothesis, we found that a large
number (30) of codons in the HSA1 PRAME family have
been subject to positive selection. 26 of these adaptive
codons were confirmed using the "sitewise likelihoodratio" (SLR) method [41] (data not shown). These sites

are clustered onto one surface in a homology model of
protein structure, thereby demarcating a likely surfaceaccessible functional site. Mouse PRAME genes also contain a large number (17) of positively selected sites, which
cluster within a site equivalent to that for human PRAME
genes (Figure 6).
Expansion of this PRAME gene family has occurred independently in both primate and rodent lineages. In each of
these lineages, PRAME genes appear to have evolved by
'birth-and-death' processes, such as occurs for immunity
genes [42]: genes both persist as duplications, and are lost
by pseudogene creation. Sequence similarities between
paralogues, however, could have arisen also from
concerted evolution, as the result of homologous recombination, in particular, gene conversion and unequal
crossing over [43]. Nevertheless, the recent origin of the
PRAME progenitor gene just prior to the common ancestor of primates and rodents, and its rapid duplication
thereafter, and the occurrence of CNPs in the human population, each indicates that the predominant process in
this expansion has been gene duplication. Moreover, the
congruency of dendrograms associated with separate
exons or introns (Figures 3 and 4, and Additional files 1,
2, 3), and the tandem segmental duplications we have
inferred (Figure 1; Figure 5), also argue against concerted
evolution as a dominant evolutionary mechanism.
PRAME genes have arisen by rapid gene duplication and
pseudogene creation, and their sequences have been subject to positive selection. Nevertheless, the adaptive
advantages conferred on these genes by their duplication
and sequence diversification remain unclear, as are the
genes' functions in normal tissues. Their expression profile often is limited to testes and to a wide variety of
tumors, which suggests that PRAME proteins might perform important mitotic roles in rapidly dividing cells. This
is consistent with the observation that a PRAME-like gene
(oogenesin) in mouse accumulates in the nucleus only at
the late one-cell and early two-cell stages of early embryos
[22].
At least one of the mouse orthologues of these PRAME
genes is expressed in spermatogonial cells [21]. Interestingly, it is known that a mutation in FGFR2 expressed in
these cells confers a selective advantage, thereby leading
to clonal expansion similar to that seen in tumours [44].
We suggest that similar nonsynonymous substitutions in
PRAME genes might have conferred comparable benefits
to these cells, and these have driven positive selection for
both gene duplication and sequence change.
The evidence thus points mainly to darwinian selection in
spermatogonia, and adaptive evolution of PRAME genes
thus may be thought not to have phenotypic conse-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/120

quences at larger anatomical scales. Nevertheless, a gene
with a similar function, and a similar evolutionary history, to PRAME genes, has been proposed to having contributed to anatomical adaptations during recent hominid
evolution. The Abnormal spindle-like microcephaly associated
(ASPM) gene, which has evolved rapidly in the great apes
[45], has roles in both spermatogenesis and oogenesis in
Drosophila [46,47]. When mutated in humans, this results
in primary microcephaly, which is manifested by a greatly
reduced brain size [6]. Further examination of human
PRAME genes' functions should assist in our understanding of the cellular and physiological consequences of its
recent and rapid evolution.

Conclusion
Whatever the selective advantages conferred by the
PRAME genes discussed here, it is apparent from their
recent introduction to an ancestral chromosome of primates and rodents that they benefited only these lineages.
Moreover, the HSA1 PRAME gene family has expanded
further, in particular by two large segmental duplications
in the past 3 MY and further duplications that manifest
themselves as copy number polymorphisms in the human
population. These extremely rapid duplications, taken
together with strong evidence for darwinian adaptation at
approximately 30 sites among human PRAME genes, indicates that this family has experienced sustained episodes
of positive selection during recent hominin history.

Methods
Survey of human CT-Antigen genes
We recently identified 41 human gene families that have
experienced multiple gene duplications since the divergence of rodent and primate lineages [11]. Among these
were 6 families, SSX-like, MAGE, GAGE, XAGE, SAGE and
SPAN-X, all encoded on the X chromosome, which exhibit
the tissue expression profiles of CT-antigens (CTAs). A
seventh CTA family, recently duplicated in our lineage,
encode PRAME genes that are located on Homo sapiens
chromosome 1 (HSA1). In an initial survey, only 2 of
these 7 families yielded evidence of positive selection at
individual sites using codeml (data not shown), using
methods and criteria described below. Subsequently, we
chose to perform more comprehensive analyses of the
PRAME gene family because of its larger size (13 human
ENSEMBL predicted genes) and its high number of positively selected sites identified.
Prediction of human PRAME genes and exons
The amino acid sequences of 5 PRAME homologues were
aligned using CLUSTALW [48]. These are genes that were
identified by Ensembl [11,49] and lie in a cluster between
bases 12550000 and 13100000 of human chromosome 1
(assembly NCBI35). (Many of the remaining 8 ENSEMBL
PRAME genes were mispredicted.) From this multiple

Page 13 of 19

BMC Genomics 2005, 6:120

alignment a hidden Markov model (HMM) was constructed [50]. On the basis of strong conservation of a
translation initiating methionine codon, presumed noncoding sequence upstream of this codon was discarded.
In order to ensure gene prediction fidelity and completeness, we repredicted PRAME homologous genes and pseudogenes from this region of HSA1 (bases 12550000 and
13100000, which include the flanking non-homologous
RefSeq genes, DHRS3 and T1A-2). Gene prediction
employed Genewise [51], the PRAME HMM and default
parameters. Upon building phylogenetic trees, the predicted PRAME homologues were found to be monophyletic, and are only distantly-related to other PRAME
homologous genes located elsewhere on HSA1 and on
HSA22 (data not shown). Pseudogenes were distinguished from genes on the basis of premature stop codons
or frameshifts; pseudogenes that are functionally disrupted due only to mutations that occur outside of coding
sequence are thus misassigned.
In an independent approach, we also predicted homologues of each of the three protein-coding exons of these
PRAME genes within this region of HSA1 using HMMs of
multiply aligned nucleotide exonic sequence. This procedure resulted in no predictions that were additional to
those found using Genewise and full-length gene
sequence.
Prediction of mouse PRAME genes
Mouse PRAME genes were predicted as described above
for human genes, except for the use of known mouse
'PRAME-like' (PRAMEL) genes to derive the HMM used in
the Genewise step. Initially a CLUSTALW alignment of
three known mouse RefSeq genes (PRAMEL1 [RefSeq
code: NM_031377.1], PRAMEL3 [NM_031390.1] and
PRAMEL4 [NM_178248.2]) was used for the HMM query
template. The 3' ends of the PRAMEL genes, however,
were found to be relatively divergent. The alignment was
thus trimmed back to exclude the ends of the third, and
final, exons. Thus the alignment of mouse PRAME proteins is 58 amino acids shorter than that of human
PRAME proteins. Mouse genes were predicted within the
orthologous region of the mouse genome (Mus musculus
chromosome 4 [MMU4]; May 2004 assembly; bases
141,850,000–142,800,000) between mouse DHRS3 and
T1A-2. 29 mouse PRAMEL genes and pseudogenes were
predicted from this approach. An HMM was then derived
from a multiple alignment of these sequences and used to
query this region of MMU4 in a second round of searches.
Four additional predictions were found.
Prediction of chimpanzee PRAME genes and exons
Chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) PRAME genes were predicted as for human genes, as described above, using the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/120

HMM derived from the alignment of human PRAME
amino acid sequences as query to search a region lying
between orthologous DHRS3 and T1A-2 genes on chimpanzee chromosome 1 (PTR1, bases 10240000–
13450000, Nov 2003 assembly). This method identified
17 full-length chimpanzee PRAME genes. This gene count
was substantially fewer than for the human genome
assembly, and may be a consequence of the low (fourfold) statistical coverage of the chimpanzee genome
assembly. We reasoned, therefore, that additional nonfull-length PRAME gene exons might be represented in the
chimpanzee genome assembly. We thus predicted homologues of each of the three PRAME gene exons in this
region using the protocol (described above) that was used
for predicting human PRAME gene exons.
Prediction of introns
Human and chimp intron sequences were identified as
the sequence intervening between adjacent exons. PRAME
genes contain 3 coding exons (labelled A, B, C) and 2
intervening introns, labelled intron a and intron b. For
human sequence, these introns were all complete, without gaps, but for chimpanzee sequence only 9 intact
intron a and 5 intron b chimpanzee introns could be
identified.

Exon, intron and splice site predictions from these three
species were all consistent with the gene structures apparent from available cDNAs, in particular 14 cDNAs
mapped to human HSA1 bases 12769277–1349033, 29
cDNAs mapped to mouse MMU4 bases 141852757–
142731257, and cDNAs from the eponymous PRAME
gene on HSA22 (bases 21,215,046–21,218,065). Conservation of gene structures between mammals as diverse as
human and mouse, together with conservation of splice
sites, indicates that chimpanzee PRAME genes also possess an identical gene structure.
Sequence alignments
Conceptual translations of PRAME genes and pseudogenes were aligned using CLUSTAL W [48] and then modified to minimise gaps (see Additional files 1, 2, 3). Stop
characters were replaced by 'X'. Estimates of KA and KS for
sequence pairs (see below) were calculated from cDNA
sequences aligned according to these amino acid multiple
alignments.

Human and chimpanzee nucleotide intronic sequences
were aligned using DIALIGN-2 [52].
Exonic evolutionary rates
Codeml [23] was used to conduct site-specific KA/KS analysis on the human and mouse full length PRAME predictions. An amino acid alignment and corresponding cDNA
alignment were prepared for each analysis. Identified

Page 14 of 19

BMC Genomics 2005, 6:120

pseudogenes were removed from the alignment because
they are likely to be no longer subject to selective
constraints.
The maximum likelihood approach of Yang [40] was used
to predict sites in a group of cDNA sequences that have
been subject to positive selection. Pairs of models were
compared by calculating log likelihood values (l), which
were then compared for significant differences using a
Likelihood Ratio Test. The first of each pair of models
compared is a simple model where sites are predicted to
be associated with KA/KS ratios between 0 and 1. The second is a more complex model that allows adaptive sites:
for these, ratios can be greater than 1. If the complex
model indicates an estimated KA/KS ratio that is greater
than one, and the test statistic (2∆l) is greater than critical
values of the Chi square (χ2) distribution with the appropriate degree of freedom [53], then positive selection can
be inferred. Bayesian probabilities are used to predict
which codons in the original data have most likely been
subjected to positive selection.
The pairs of simple and complex models we used were:
M0 (one-ratio) [54] versus M3 (discrete) [23]; M1 (neutral) versus M2 (selection) [55]; and M7 (beta) versus M8
(beta + ω) [23,40]. Only non-conserved alignment
positions predicted to be under positive selection with a
posterior probability > 0.90 by all three codeml models
were mapped onto a homologous protein structure (Figure 6).
Intronic evolutionary rates
Using the DIALIGN-2 alignment of intronic sequences,
we calculated their genetic distances using the TN93
nucleotide substitution model [56]. We then derived a
phylogenetic tree based on the distance matrix using
neighbour-joining methods (1000 bootstrap iterations).
Numbers of nucleotide substitutions per intronic site
between sequence pairs (KI) were then estimated using
BASEML [38,39], a maximum likelihood method, and the
TN93 nucleotide substitution model. This analysis was
implemented using the DAMBE package [57].
Structure
In order to gain insight into the functional relevance of
positively selected sites, we searched the protein
sequences of known tertiary structure using PSI-BLAST
[25] using a human PRAME sequence (Homo_7; UniProt:
YA03_HUMAN) at NCBI using default parameters. Significant sequence similarity (E = 1 × 10-12) was found after
three search iterations to porcine ribonuclease inhibitor,
RNI (PDB code 2BNH). Two types of alignment guided
the assignment of leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) to human
PRAME sequences. First, the BLAST alignment, and second the optimal and suboptimal alignments of PRAME

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/120

sequence against the SMART [58] LRR HMM. RNI was first
aligned to Homo_7 using these methods, and adjusted
manually, and then aligned to the full alignment of all
human PRAMEs guided by the Homo_7 alignment. This
allowed human PRAME positively selected sites (as identified by the method above) to be mapped to RNI residues. This procedure was also followed to align full-length
mouse PRAMEL sequences against RNI. Protein tertiary
structure was viewed, manipulated and annotated in
Swiss Pdbviewer [59].
Evolutionary relationships
Phylogenetic relationships were deduced from dendrograms constructed from three types of neutral rate estimates: either (i) KS values of pairwise alignments of fulllength coding sequences; (ii) KS values of pairwise alignments of coding sequences from exons A, B or C; or (iii)
KI values of pairwise alignments of intronic sequences
from introns a or b. Dendrograms were constructed using
code based on PHYLIP [60] which uses the Fitch-Margoliash criteria to build trees with contemporaneous tips. The
dendrograms were visualised in njplot and treeview [61].
Copy number polymorphisms (CNPs)
The database of Genomic variants ([62,12,36]) was queried to determine whether the human PRAME region has
been determined previously to harbour CNPs.
