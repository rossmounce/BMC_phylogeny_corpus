Abstract
Background: Egg white must provide nutrients and protection to the developing avian embryo. One way in
which this is achieved is an arsenal of antimicrobial proteins and peptides which are essentially extensions of the
innate immune system. Gallin is a recently identified member of a family of peptides that are found in egg white.
The function of this peptide family has not been identified and they are potentially antimicrobial.
Results: We have confirmed that there are at least 3 forms of the gallin gene in the chicken genome in 3 separate
lines of chicken, all the forms are expressed in the tubular cells of the magnum region of the oviduct, consistent
with its presence in egg white. mRNA expression levels are in the order 10,000 times greater in the magnum than
the shell gland. The conservation between the multiple forms of gallin in the chicken genome compared with the
conservation between gallin and other avian gallin like peptides, suggests that the gene duplication has occurred
relatively recently in the chicken lineage. The gallin peptide family contains a six cysteine motif (C-X5-C-X3-C-X11-CX3-C-C) found in all defensins, and is most closely related to avian beta-defensins, although the cysteine spacing
differs. Further support for the classification comes from the presence of a glycine at position 10 in the 41 amino
acid peptide. Recombinant gallin inhibited the growth of Escherischia coli (E. coli) at a concentration of 0.25 μM
confirming it as part of the antimicrobial innate immune system in avian species.
Conclusions: The relatively recent evolution of multiple forms of a member of a new defensin related group of
peptides that we have termed ovodefensins, may be an adaptation to increase expression or the first steps in
divergent evolution of the gene in chickens. The potent antimicrobial activity of the peptide against E. coli
increases our understanding of the antimicrobial strategies of the avian innate immune system particularly those of
the egg white and the evolution of the defensin family. The potential of this peptide and others in the family can
now be investigated in a number of novel antimicrobial roles.

Background
Gallin was first noted using a proteomic approach to the
analysis of chicken egg white [1]. It was named gallin
because of its homology to meleagrin, a peptide previously discovered as a contaminant in a turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) ovomucin preparation [2] and to cygnin,
discovered in the preparation of black swan (Cygnus
atratus) lysozyme [3]. Recently two similar peptides
named BPS1 and 2 were found in duck (Anas

platyrhynchos) egg white [4]. Clearly cygnin, meleagrin,
gallin and BPS 1 and 2 are all peptides found in egg
white and because of the large number of antimicrobial
peptides already known in egg white it seems tenable
that prevention of bacterial growth is a potential role for
these new molecules [5]. It was speculated that meleagrin might be antimicrobial, but no evidence was
observed against an E. coli strain [2] and no clues as to
its evolution were offered, although similarities to ovotransferrin were suggested [3]. These were echoed in the
examination of meleagrin [2] and the duck sequences
[4]. This was based on the presence of 3 cysteines in
ovotransferrin in the region proposed as homologous.

One group of innate immune genes which has been well
characterised in the chicken is the avian beta-defensins
(AvBDs), with at least 14 members [6] which are found
in a cluster on chromosome 3 [7]. Beta-defensins are
characterised by their cationic nature and the presence
of 3 disulfide bonds [8] and are part of a large family
which are thought to work by interacting with the cell
membrane of microbes to permeablise them [9]. Some
human beta-defensins have been shown to have copy
number variation which may be associated with Crohn’s
disease and psoriasis [10]. Antimicrobial peptides, along
with other egg white proteins, have potentially important roles in protecting the egg and its contents from
infection and have potential for exploitation in the control of microbial growth in novel ways [11].
Our overall aim in this study was to classify gallin and
define its role and expression in the chicken. To that
end we have confirmed the hypothesis that gallin is
related to the beta-defensin family based on its structure
and cysteine residues. We also confirmed the number of
forms in the genome. Further we determined that its
expression in tissues of the chicken was consistent with
its presence in egg white and elaborated which forms
are expressed in the oviduct. Finally we determined that,
as hypothesised, gallin has antimicrobial properties.

Methods
Genomic localization and re-sequencing

Using the Staden alignment programme [12] a 364 bp
core consensus sequence was determined using the following EST sequence accession numbers; EMBL:
BX266328, BX266329, BX275032, BX275033, BX275163,
BX275164, DT659917.

The sequence was used to perform a BLAT search
[13] of the chicken genome May 2006 release using the
default parameters at the UCSC genome browser [14].
Chromosome and positions on the chromosome of
homologous sequence were recorded.
Primers used for re-sequencing were designed to be
specific for the genomic DNA surrounding the 3 forms
that were identified in the genome using the BLAT
search of the chicken genome. This was achieved by
masking the conserved regions using Primer 3 software
[15,16]. In the case of what we termed form 1, which
had a larger intron between the 2 predicted exons, 2
specific pairs of primers were used, one for each exon.
The primers designed (Table 1) amplified 564 bp containing exon 1 of form 1; 657 bp containing exon 2 of
form 1; 806 bp containing exon 1 and 2 of form 2; 751
bp containing exon 1 and 2 of form 3. Re-sequencing
was initially carried out using 8 pure line Rhode Island
red sires and subsequently 8 sires from a broiler line
and 8 sires from a silkie line.
Bioinformatic analysis

The UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot protein database was
searched using PSI-blast [17] and the zebra finch DNA
database (Taeniopygia_guttata-3.2.4-contigs) [18] was
searched using TBLASTN to locate potential homologues using the 41 amino acid mature gallin sequence.
Further searches were made with the homologues discovered. Putative peptide sequences were aligned using
ClustalW [19]. Upstream promoter regions were downloaded from Ensembl Biomart [20]. Phylogenetic trees
were built using peptide or DNA sequence in Mega 4.0
[21] using the neighbour joining method. The tree

nodes were tested using bootstrapping with 1000
replicates.
Animals and tissue collection

For comparison between expression levels in different
parts of the oviduct, magnum, isthmus and shell gland
tissue including the mucosa, muscularis and outer serosa was obtained from 11 sexually mature hens which
all had fully developed reproductive organs, however the
stage at which the ovum was in the oviduct varied
between individuals. Additionally tissue was taken from
small intestine and cloaca. After dissection tissue was
frozen in liquid N 2 and stored at -80°C. Samples
weighed on average 0.12 g. In a separate study magnum
tissue was obtained from hens killed with an ovum at
different stages of passage through the oviduct. Magnum
tissue was processed from hens that had been killed
when there was either an egg in the magnum (n = 7),
an egg in the shell gland (n = 8) or when there was no
evidence of ovulation that day, a so called pause day
(n = 8). After dissection tissue was stored in RNA later®
(Ambion, Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK) and
subsequently stored at -80°C. Tissues for immunolocalisation studies (magnum, isthmus, shell gland and caecum) were harvested from 4 of these laying hens at post
mortem and fixed in 10% buffered-neutral formalin
(BNF) for 24 hours prior to being processed to paraffin
wax using a 16 hour processing cycle on a Thermoshandon Excelsior tissue processor. All animals were killed
according to schedule 1 of the animals (scientific procedures) act 1986, UK under project licence PPL 60/3964.
RNA preparation

The tissue was homogenised in Lysing Matrix D tubes
(Q-biogene-Alexis Ltd., Nottingham, UK) containing
Ultraspec II total RNA isolation reagent (AMS Biotechnology, Oxon, UK) using a FastPrep FP120 homogeniser
and processed as per protocol (Q-biogene-Alexis Ltd).
Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain
reaction (RT-QPCR) assay for all gallin forms

A 1 μg sample of total RNA was reverse transcribed
using a First Strand synthesis kit (GE Healthcare Life
Sciences, Buckinghamshire, UK) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Reverse transcribed samples were
diluted prior to use by a factor of 10 with dH20. Primers
Gallin AllF1 and Gallin Genomic1R2 (Table 1) were
designed to amplify all forms of gallin. The programme
Primer3 [15,16] was used to design the primers along
with visual inspection to ensure they would amplify all
genes. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase
chain reaction (RT-QPCR) was carried out using 10 μl of
the diluted cDNA according to Platinum SYBR Green
qPCR Supermix-UDG master mix (Invitrogen)

instructions with a primer concentration of 20 mM. RTQPCR reactions were run on an MX3000 (Stratagene)
using the following conditions 95°C for 2 min, then 40
cycles of 95°C for 15 s, 60°C for 30 s. Reactions with no
template were run as controls. PCR products for each
amplicon were obtained using standard PCR conditions.
These were purified and quantified using a Nanodrop™
spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific) and used to construct standard curves for the determination of relative
concentrations. Standards were diluted to produce top
standards which were detectable during RT-QPCR
amplification at around 15 cycles with six ten-fold serial
dilutions forming the standard curve. Agarose gels were
run to confirm that only product of the correct length
free from primer-dimer were amplified by each primer
pair and the product was sequenced directly. Concentrations were normalized using GAPDH measured in the
same way [22]. One way ANOVA was used for statistical
analysis of data using Genstat 10th edition (VSN International Ltd, Oxon, UK). Log transformation was used to
give approximate normality and consistency of variances.
Estimation of proportional expression of gallin isoforms

Re-sequencing of a layer strain of chicken indicated that
the restriction enzyme digestion of the PCR product
using NlaIII and AciI each distinguish one of the forms
from the other two. By estimating the proportion of a
single form against the other two forms it was possible
to calculate the proportions of all of the forms expressed
in any tissue of the layers. Form 1 amplified with Primers Gallin AllF1 and Gallin Genomic1R2 and cut with
AciI produces restriction fragments of 263, 59 and 2 bp
whilst form 2 and 3 produced restriction fragments of
177, 86, 59 and 2 bp. Form 1 and 3 amplified with Primers Gallin AllF1 and Gallin Genomic1R2 cut with
NlaIII produces restriction fragments of 254, 39 and 31
bp whilst form 2 produces restriction fragments of 285
and 39 bp. The intensity of the bands were measured
using a G:BOX imaging system (SYNGENE, Cambridge,
UK) and were quantified using the gel macro facility in
Scion Image Beta 4.0.3 (Scion Corporation, Frederick,
MD).
Production and titres of polyclonal anti-gallin antibodies

Two rabbits (R110 and R111) were immunized four
times at three week intervals by intramuscular injection
of 500 μg of folded synthesized gallin emulsified in 50%
complete Freund’s adjuvant for the first injection and in
50% incomplete Freund’s adjuvant for the others. Rabbits were euthanized three weeks after the last injection
and blood was collected by allowing it to clot at room
temperature for 2 hours then storing it overnight at 4°C.
Blood was centrifuged at 2000 g to remove blood cells
and the antisera were collected and stored at -20°C.

Gong et al. BMC Immunology 2010, 11:12
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2172/11/12

To measure the titres of anti-gallin in the R110 and
R111 antisera, synthesized gallin was diluted with 0.1 M
sodium carbonate/bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.7) to a concentration of 10 μg/ml and 100 μl of the solution were
added to each well of a 96-well plate. The plate was covered and stored overnight at room temperature. The
wells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered
saline (pH 7.4), 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST), and the plates
were incubated for 90 min at 37°C with PBST, 1%
Bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma), to block unsaturated binding sites. Then pre-immune (null) sera and
antisera were diluted 1/15 to 1/16000 with PBST, 0.2%
BSA, pH 7.4. To each well, 100 μl of diluted null sera or
antisera were added and the plate incubated for 1 h at
37°C. The plate was again washed three times with
PBST. Goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin-G, F(ab’)2 fragment specific, conjugated to horseradish peroxidase
(IgG-HRP) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories,
West Groove, PA) diluted 1/625 to 1/5000 with PBST,
0.2% BSA, pH 7.4. 100 μl was applied to each well, and
the plate incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. After five washings, peroxidase activity was detected by adding 100 μl/
well of ABTS [2,2’azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazolinesulfonic
acid)] ready-to-use solution (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). After incubation for 5 to 30 min at
room temperature, the absorbance at 405 nm was measured with a spectrophotometer. All animal handling
protocols were carried out in accordance with the European Communities Council Directives of 24 November
1986 (86/609/EEC) and the French decree 87848 of 19
October 1987 (revised on the 31th of May, 2001).
Immunohistochemistry (IHC)

Wax embedded tissues were sectioned at 3 microns
using a thermoshandon finesse microtome, lifted onto
vetabond slides and incubated at 60°C for 1 hour before
de-waxing and taken down to water. Each section was
then treated with Proteinase K for 15 minutes at room
temperature (antigen retrieval) before being loaded on
to a Dako Autostainer. A standard IHC protocol was
then used with optimal staining achieved using a 1:5000
dilution of the polyclonal anti-gallin antiserum (R110)
for 60 minutes. The sections were viewed using a Leica
DM 4000 B microscope and images captured using a
Leica DC480 camera with Qwin program for PC.
Peptide expression

A DNA fragment encoding the gallin peptide coding
region was amplified by PCR using primers GallinF and
GallinR from magnum cDNA. The product from the
PCR was excised from an agarose gel and used in a 2nd
round of PCR using primers GallinEXF and GallinEXR
which were partially homologous to GallinF and GallinR
with the exception that a PstI site was introduced. The

Page 4 of 15

2nd round PCR products containing the gallin coding
sequence flanked by the PstI restriction sites were
digested with PstI, purified and then ligated into the PstI
site of the pRSET C expression vector (Invitrogen). The
recombinant vector was transformed into TOP10F’ bacteria, plasmid purified and sequenced to confirm it was
in the correct orientation and translational frame. Once
confirmed the recombinant construct pRSET C_gallin
was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3-)pLysS. For
expression the transformed cells were grown at 16°C in
250 ml of SOB medium. Induction of expression of the
peptide was initiated by adding 1 mM of IPTG (isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside) to the medium when the
cell density reached 0.5 (OD600). The cells were cultured
at 16°C for 3 hours and harvested by centrifugation at
4000 g, 4°C, for 10 min. The pellet was washed and resuspended in 5 ml of 20 mM phosphate-buffer (pH 7.0)
and lysed by sonication. The soluble fraction was recovered and proteins analysed on bisTris Mini Gels using
the XCell SureLock™ system (Invitrogen) and stained
with SimplyBlue™ SafeStain (Invitrogen). As a control,
the peptide produced from non-recombinant pRSET C
was produced in the same manner.
Western analyses for His Tag fusion peptide expression

Soluble fractions were run as above and transferred onto
a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon™-P;
Millipore). Western blot analysis was performed using a
SuperSignal® West HisProbe™ Kit (Pierce, Rockford IL)
as per protocol. Finally the chemiluminescence detection
reaction was performed by using equal volumes of
Luminol/Enhancer solution with stable Peroxide Solution (Thermo, USA), and the membrane was exposed to
X-ray film for 30 seconds.
Purification and concentration of the fusion peptides

The His-tagged fusion peptides were purified using
Immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) HisPur purification cartridges kit (ThermoFisher Scientific,
Perbio science, Cramlington, UK), according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 5 ml of supernatant
containing gallin peptide was denatured with 5 ml of 8
M urea and incubated for 30 minutes at 4°C in a Hispur
Cobalt Spin Column on an end-over-end rocking platform. The column was washed with two bed volumes of
buffer 1 (100 mM NaH2PO4, 150 mM NaCl, 8 M urea,
20 mM imidazole, pH 8.0) and six bed volumes of buffer
2 (50 mM NaH2PO4, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole,
pH8.0) to refold and remove contaminating proteins
whilst still bound to the column. The recombinant Histagged fusion peptides were then eluted with 9 ml of
50 mM elution buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 500 mM NaCl,
250 mM imidazole pH8.0). The fusion proteins were
concentrated using centrifugal filters with a molecular

Gong et al. BMC Immunology 2010, 11:12

weight cut off of 3 kDa (Millipore, Carrigtwohill, Co.
Cork, Ireland). This was passed through the filter 3
times with 20 mM phosphate buffer in order to transfer
the peptide into this buffer. Protein concentration was
determined by a Coomassie Plus (Bradford) Assay Kit
(Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as the protein
standard.
Antimicrobial assay

The antimicrobial assay method was essentially as
described previously [23,24]. E. coli BL21(DE3-)pLysS
was cultured at 37°C overnight in Luria broth (LB). Two
hundred and fifty μl of overnight culture was sub-cultured into 20 ml of LB and incubated for 3 hours at
37°C. After the second incubation, 20 μl of culture was
diluted with 2 ml of PBS. Ten microliters of gallin (1.5,
3.0, 6.0 μM) or pRSETC control peptide extract (1.5,
3.0, 6.0 μM) or PBS (control) was added to 50 μl of
diluted culture to produce final concentrations of 0.25,
0.5 and 1.0 μM respectively. This was vortexed and
incubated for 3 h at 37°C and then the suspensions
were serially diluted to 1 × 10-4 with PBS, the 1 × 10-3
and 1 × 10-4 dilutions being plated on agar plates. All
plates were incubated overnight at 37°C and the colonies
were counted. Ten microliters of ampicillin (300 μg/ml)
were used as a positive control.

Results
Genomic location and bioinformatics

The 364 bp EST consensus sequence containing the
predicted coding region of the gene had high identity to
3 locations in the May 2006 chicken (Gallus gallus) v2.1
draft genomic sequence assembly; 99.2% to a region on
the minus strand of chromosome 3 (109912867109913892) spanning 1026 bp (form 1); 97.8% to a
region on the minus strand of chromosome 3
(109920354-109920879) spanning 526 bp (form 2);
96.7% to a region on the positive strand of chromosome
3 (109923486-109924011) spanning 526 bp (form 3).
When the regions containing the sequences with high
similarity to the core consensus sequence were resequenced the result obtained was 99.7% identical to the
May 2006 chicken (Gallus gallus) v2.1 draft genomic
sequence assembly for form 1 with 1 difference in an
exon which is the site of a known SNP
(snp.17.145.10816.S.2) and a 4 base deletion which
restores a putative TATAA site; 99.6% identical for
form 2 including a known SNP (snp.17.145.2833.S.1) but
in the case of form 3 the identity was only 98.7% due to
some mismatches near the site of a 10 bp gap in the
genome assembly. The result of re-sequencing the 3
forms of gallin for all 3 strains of chicken have been
submitted to the EMBL nucleotide database with accession numbers FN550404-FN550415. The sequencing of

Page 5 of 15

the third form also demonstrated that there was not a
premature stop codon in the sequence (accession number FN550413-FN550415. This had been suggested by
the May 2006 chicken (Gallus gallus) v2.1 draft genomic
sequence assembly but it is at a site in the v2.1 draft
genomic sequence where two contigs (contig 17.145 and
17.144) abut and this is likely to explain the discrepancy.
Re-sequencing of 24 sires from 3 lines of chicken (Broiler, layer and silkie) using primers unique for the genomic DNA flanking the 3 forms of gallin demonstrate
that each is present in the genome of all lines and that
each gene locus is unique. In the sequence obtained
from the laying strain all the predicted peptide
sequences from the 3 forms were identical, except in
the signal peptide (Figure 1A). If the 23 amino acid signal peptide is included form 2 and form 3 have identical
protein sequences whilst form 1 is 92% identical and
95% similar to form 2 and form 3. However, there were
some non-synonymous polymorphisms observed in broilers and silkies in addition to the allelic variant seen in
the layer strains which caused conservative changes to
the amino acid sequence (Figure 1A). These were I24V
in gallin form 1, T9A in gallin form 2 and N59S in gallin form 3.
The mature gallin peptide of 41 amino acids shares
62% identity and 72% similarity with cygnin and 65%
identity and 83% similarity with meleagrin. In addition
to gallin, meleagrin and cygnin a further protein, BPS2,
was identified in duck egg white that had an identical
sequence to cygnin with accession number Swiss-Prot:
P85124[4] and a putative peptide in the zebra finch
from the Jul. 2008 Taeniopygia guttata draft assembly at
position 111,191,062-111,191,184 on chromosome 3
with an identical copy at 111,176,525-111,176,647 (Figure 1B). A further potential paralog in the zebra finch
was found at chr3:111,194,305-111,194,418 (Figure 1B)
which may be homologous to BPS1, Swiss-Prot P85123
[4]. We named these taeniopygin1 and 2 (Figure 1B).
The gallin, cygnin, meleagrin, taeniopygin 1 and duck
BPS2 mature peptides contain six cysteines spaced in a
C-X5-C-X3-C-X11-C-X3-C-C motif at position 6, 12, 16,
28 and 32-33 in the respective mature peptides (Figure
2A). All are relatively cationic with a number of conserved arginine residues (Figure 2A). Within the ovodefensins there are 2 groups, those containing gallin,
meleagrin cygnin, BPS2 and taeniopygin1 (Figure 2A)
and a second group which contains taeniopygin2 and
duck BPS1 (Figure 2B). This second group has a C-X3C-X3-C-X11-C-X4-C-C motif however in the phylogeny
presented only taeniopygin2 appears as an outgroup
(Figure 2C).
Comparison of alignments of ovodefensins with
known AvBDs indicates that the cysteine arrangement is
conserved although the spacing between the cysteines

polymorphism in the peptide sequence observed from sequencing genomic DNA from lines of layer, broilers and silkie hens (n = 8/line) are

differs from one to three amino acids (Figure 3A). The
phylogeny including ovotransferrin and a mouse betadefensin (Defb7) shows that the ovodefensin molecules
form their own group. The branch lengths are shorter
(Figure 3B) indicating that the ovodefensins appear to
be more conserved than the AvBDs. The molecules are
more similar to beta-defensins than to ovotransferrin
(Figure 3B) which appears as an outlier.
The analysis of the promoter region indicates that the
proximal promoter in form 2 and form 3 are 95% identical for 60 bp upstream of the putative transcription
start site, thereafter they are about 38% identical over
448 bases. All forms share 38% identity in the 60 bp
upstream of the putative transcription start site and
about 32% over 448 bases upstream (Figure 4).
Tissue expression

Measurement of gallin expression indicated that the
amount of gallin mRNA in the magnum of the oviduct
was around 100 times more than in the isthmus, which
was in turn around 140 times more than in the shell
gland (Figure 5). Levels in small intestine and skin were
even lower than in the shell gland (data not shown).
Using specific restriction digests the proportions of the
3 forms (mean ± sem) of the mRNA in the magnum
was: form 1, 26.8 ± 2.8%; form 2, 52.1 ± 3.2%; form 3,

25.4 ± 3.0% and in the isthmus: form 2, 85.8 ± 5.4%;
form 3, 14.2 ± 5.4% and form 1 was not expressed (Figure 5). Expression in the magnum did not differ significantly whether the egg was in the magnum or in the
shell gland or if it was a pause day (Figure 6).
Production and titres of polyclonal anti-gallin antibodies

Two rabbits were immunized against synthesized gallin
to produce polyclonal IgG antibodies against gallin. The
ELISA determined titres of each antiserum following the
first immunisation showed high cross reactivity determined by colour production when compared to preimmune serum. At an antiserum dilution of 1/156,
values were five times that of pre-immune serum. With
the third immunisation, values increased further and at
this level of antibody production, values at 1/156 dilution were eight times the value for pre-immune serum.
Immunohistochemistry

The anti-gallin antiserum (R110) obtained as described
above, produced positive staining in the tubular glands
of both the magnum and the shell gland (Figure 7a and
7c). The variation in staining density observed in figure
7a is due to regional differences in the secretory activity
of the tubular gland cells. The staining activity of the
tubular gland cells in the shell gland was highly

dependant on the stage of egg formation. (Figure 7c and
7e). A proportion of the ciliated cells associated with the
surface epithelium in both the magnum and shell gland
(Figure 7) also stained positive, irrespective of the phase
of the laying cycle (Figure 7e arrows). No staining was
observed in caecum (Figure 7f) and no staining was
observed in any of the tissues in the absence of the primary antibody (Figure 7b, d).
Antimicrobial activity

Recombinant peptide was detected in western blots of
His Tag purified protein migrating at the anticipated
size of around 9.5 kilo Daltons after IPTG induction
(Figure 8). Purification was confirmed by increased signal using the HisProbe antibody after concentration.
Purified preparations of recombinant protein containing

the gallin peptide showed a relatively dramatic effect on
the survival of E. coli with around 50% inhibition
demonstrated at 0.25 μM and 95% inhibition at 1 μM
(Figure 9). The control peptide showed no inhibition of
bacterial growth at these concentrations (Figure 9).

Discussion
We have collected a number of strands of evidence
which support our hypothesis that gallin is a member of
a new class of antimicrobial peptides found in egg
white, the ovodefensins, which are related to the betadefensins.
Simpson [3] followed by Odani [2] compared the
cygnin and meleagrin sequences to part of avian ovotransferrin. The alignment between the 2 proteins alone,
meleagrin and ovotransferrin, suggested conservation of

sequence alignment of ovodefensins (top), avian beta-defensins (middle) and the ovotransferrin sequence (bottom) used by Odani [2]. The

Complete conservation between all molecules is indicated with ‘*’ and weakly similar with ‘.’. The black bars at the top of the diagram indicate
the known cysteine bonds in avian beta-defensins and ovodefensins. The avian beta-defensins nomenclature follows that suggested in [6]. A
mouse defensin, mouse beta-defensin 7, NP_631966 (Def7), was included to indicate the relationship between avian beta-defensins, mammalian
defensins and ovodefensins. Where the Latin name has been used as the basis for the peptide name the common name for the species can be
found in Figure 2C adjacent to the peptide names. B) The evolutionary history was inferred from the alignment in A using the Neighbor-Joining
method as detailed in figure 2 with the exception the complete deletion option was used.

7 residues out of 40 with only half of the key cysteine
residues conserved. In the egg white proteome paper of
Mann [1] no suggestion was made to the nature of the
gallin like peptides and Nanukool et al. [4] followed the
lead of Odani. However the gallin, cygnin, meleagrin,
taeniopygin1 and duck BPS2 mature peptides all have a
C-X5-C-X3-C-X11-C-X3-C-C motif (Figure 2A, 3). Comparison of alignments with known AvBDs indicates that
the cysteine arrangement is conserved although the

spacing between the cysteines differs (Figure 3A). Seven
residues (6 cysteines and one glycine) are almost completely conserved between the ovodefensins and the
AvBDs (Figure 3A). But only 2 residues are conserved if
ovotransferrin is included in the alignment (Figure 3A).
The general sequence of beta-defensins is C-X6-C-X4-CX9-C-X6-C-C [25] but a more relaxed consensus is C-X
(4 to 8)-C-X(3 to 5-C-X(9 to 13)-C-X(4 to 7)-C-C [7] so the
ovodefensins have a shorter spacing between the 4th and

of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Maximum Composite
Likelihood method [43] and are in the units of the number of base substitutions per site. All positions containing gaps and missing data were
eliminated from the dataset (Complete deletion option). There were a total of 489 positions in the final dataset.

5 th cysteines. There is some variation in the spacing
within the different defensin families, although none
have this pattern or such a short distance between the
4 th and 5 th cysteine [7]. It appears that the position
expected for the fourth cysteine, which would be at
position 25 in the gallin like ovodefensins, is substituted
with a serine however there is a conserved cysteine at
position 28 (Figure 2A and 3) in the gallin like ovodefensins. Other defensins such as the alpha family have a
cysteine spacing [9] which is even further from the ovodefensins than the beta-defensins. Determination of the
cysteine bonds in meleagrin and the duck BPS1 and
BPS2 peptides [2,4] suggests that the bonds between
cysteines (Figure 3) are also conserved between defensins and the ovodefensin molecules, further support for
the view that these peptides are related to beta-defensins. Overall the peptide is relatively serine rich with 3
sets of conserved serines at 13, 17 and 25 (Figure 2A)
although this is not unusual in other AvBDs (Figure 3).
We would argue that the location on chromosome 3,
close to the beta-defensins [7], the conservation of the
positions of the cysteine with the beta-defensin family
(Figure 3), and distinctive motif of 6 spaced cysteines
suggests the family are related to the defensins and possibly most closely to the avian beta-defensins.

Furthermore there is conservation of the glycine at position 10 in the mature peptide (Figure 2A and 3) consistent with the beta-defensin family [25,26] and the serine
at position 13 is also relatively well conserved. The peptides are also relatively short with the cysteine containing motif being immediately after the signal peptide
similar to many of the beta-defensins (Figure 3) but dissimilar to mature ovotransferrin which is 686 amino
acids in length [27]. Therefore we propose that these
molecules are not related to ovotransferrin and are a
new family of antimicrobial peptides, the ovodefensins,
related to the beta-defensins.
The presence of potential homologs in duck and zebra
finch suggest that the peptides are present across all the
avian vertebrate classes from passerines to anseriformes
(Figure 2A, C) and there may be further diversification
of the family with potential related peptides being identified in the duck (BPS1) [4] and in the zebra finch
(taeniopygin2) which have a spacing of C-X 3-C-X3-CX11 -C-X 4 -C-C (Figure 2B). In the phylogeny however
only taeniopygin2 appears as an outgroup (Figure 2C),
this is due to the relatively high conservation between
BPS1 and the ovodefensins outside the key cysteine,
arginine and serine residues and the spacing imposed in
the alignment.

Figure 7 The tubular gland cells of the magnum and shell gland region of the oviduct stained positive with anti-gallin antisera (R110)
when the egg was in the shell gland region (a and c). Corresponding negative controls are shown in images b and d. Positive staining was
limited to a few of the ciliated epithelial cells lining the lumen of the shell gland when the egg was more proximally placed in the oviduct (e).
The caecum was not reactive to the primary antibody (f).

The inclusion in the phylogeny (Figure 3A) of a
mouse defensin which groups within the defensins indicates that although gallin is related to the defensins it is
possible that the ovodefensins have diverged before the
avian beta-defensin family separated. In these alignments
considerable gaps need to be introduced to make the
alignment because of the different cysteine spacing but
overall it suggests that the peptides are a separate group
from the avian beta-defensins. However, in the absence
of identifiable ovodefensins in other taxa it makes it difficult to establish the exact relationship. Although they
may simply be undetected, it seems possible that the
ovodefensins are specific to birds as no similar peptide
was observed in the lizard (anolis carolinensis) genome
or other in any other genome. This might be because

either the genes were lost due to a move to viviparity,
which the lack so far of the gene in lizards would gravitate against, or they have evolved only in the avian
lineage.
Examination of the chicken genome [28] indicated
that there were three potential forms of the gene encoding gallin on chromosome 3. One form apparently contained a premature stop codon but we have
demonstrated that it is a sequencing artefact in the genome build. Therefore all forms can potentially transcribe
full length peptides. The presence of three forms in the
genome, which we have confirmed by sequencing in
three lines of chicken, suggests that this peptide may
have been duplicated to increase production of the protein for inclusion in egg white since all three forms

appear to be expressed in the magnum (Figure 5). Two
of the forms, form 2 and form 3, have similar proximate
promoters (Figure 4) and were expressed outside the
magnum in the isthmus in moderate quantities unlike
form 1 which was only observed in the magnum (Figure
5). Although some conservative substitution was
observed in the sequence of gallin in silkie and broiler
lines (Figure 1A) it still remains that the three forms are

Page 12 of 15

almost identical and produce almost identical peptides
(Figure 1A). Because these forms are more similar to
each other than they are to any of the other family
members such as meleagrin or cygnin it is possible that
these duplications are very recent in the chicken lineage.
In other words gallin may be like avidin, another egg
white gene involved in innate immunity, where there is
more than one copy [29]. Furthermore, like avidin and
some beta-defensins [30] the possibility might exist that
the number of copies may vary within an individual but
we have observed no evidence in this study from the
sequencing results. However this would not be picked
up if the entire region was duplicated. It is of course
also possible that multiple copies of ovodefensins are
present in other species. We know that 2 peptides are
expressed in the duck oviduct since the reported
sequences BPS1 and 2 were found in egg white [4] and
two putative forms are present in the zebra finch genome which appear identical and a further sequence
which is similar (Figure 1B). The sequences in duck are
clearly different and seem to represent a different evolutionary form which is similar to taeniopygin2. It is possible that the two identical zebra finch sequences may be
an assembly artefact since the chicken sequence was
used as a scaffold because of the similarity between the
genomes [31]. Either way, we have clear evidence that
there has been recent duplication in the chicken genome
of the gallin molecule. This may be similar to observations of species specific multiplication of the murine

b-defensin locus, although greater diversification has
occurred in these genes than in the case of gallin [32].
All the available evidence suggestes that the ovodefensins are present in egg white [1-4] being about the 18th
most abundant peptide as revealed by the protein abundance index in mass spectrometry [1]. Therefore gallin
would be expected to be highly expressed in the magnum of the oviduct where egg white is synthesised. This
was true, with all forms being expressed in that tissue
(Figure 5). Using primers which detected all forms we
estimated that the expression level was over 4 orders of
magnitude greater in the magnum than the shell gland
of the oviduct. The isthmus, which is adjacent to the
magnum and is thought primarily to produce the eggshell membrane, had around 40 times less expression of
gallin than the magnum (Figure 5). Expression in other
tissues where antimicrobial peptides are also known to
be expressed such as the small intestine or cloaca were
lower and essentially undetectable (data not shown).
Immunohistochemical localisation demonstrated that
the most intense staining was in the tubular gland cells
of the magnum as expected from its discovery in egg
white (Figure 7a), however there was also positive staining in the tubular gland cells of the shell gland, suggesting that although expression was lower it may still play
a role as an antimicrobial in this region of the oviduct
(Figure 7c). The secretory activity in the shell gland
however seems to be highly dependant on the stage of
the laying cycle with little or no activity being detected
when the egg is proximally situated. No staining was
seen in the caecum of the intestine (Figure 7f) reinforcing the RT-QPCR results.
The proportions of the 3 forms of the mRNA in the
magnum were dominated by form 2 but that all forms
were expressed (Figure 5). In relation to the expression
in the isthmus it would appear that form 1 is not
expressed in this tissue and form 2 predominates. Form
1 may be the original form for expression in egg white
and the extra forms seem to be slightly less precise in
their expression possibly because of the differences in
the proximal promoter sequence. The analysis of the
promoter region indicates form 2 and form 3 are almost
identical 60 bp upstream of the putative transcription
start site. Thereafter their similarity is around 32%
between all the forms (Figure 4). This suggests that
form 2 and form 3 are more similar and it is of note
they are expressed principally in the isthmus. It is also
interesting to note that a sequence of about 70-80 bases
in the promoter between about 263 and 335 bp
upstream can be found represented up to 38 times on
chromosome 3 and many times elsewhere in the genome which may have facilitated an increase in the rate
of gene duplication or segment exchange by non-homologous recombination.

The expression pattern of mRNA for gallin during an
ovulatory cycle shows no change (Figure 6). This is perhaps not surprising since the ovalbumin gene, which is
the main protein in egg white, only changes slightly
over a similar time span [33]. This may be because the
tissue secretes a large amount of protein over a relatively short period but has to synthesise and store those
proteins continuously to supply the once a day demand.
In the shell gland, where large changes in expression are
observed for shell organic matrix proteins, the secretion
is over a much longer time span [34].
All the ovodefensins are relatively cationic with a
number of conserved arginine residues (Figure 2A)
which is unlike the AvBD which have few arginine residues but a greater number, frequently at least 6, of
lysine. The large number of arginine residues is a feature
of defensins which are found in granular structures and
has been proposed to aid storage [9] which may also be
important in the magnum. There are no aspartic acid or
glutamic acid anionic residues in gallin and overall the
net positive charge is greatest for gallin (+6) and taeniopygin1 (+7) (Figure 2A). The mechanism of action of
AvBDs is not completely known, but exposed cationic
sites are thought to interact electrostatically with negatively charged membrane components of bacteria [35].
Then, after peptide accumulation, parallel to the membrane surface, dimers and multimers could be formed,
resulting in the creation of a pore [9,36]. A role as antimicrobial peptides would therefore appear to be a likely
function for this peptide family. The fact that the egg
white is known for its armoury of antimicrobial proteins
and peptides [5] that protect the embryo during incubation suggests that this might be a function of this peptide and, of course, defensins are potent antimicrobials
[9]. Cygnin purified from egg white was not observed to
have antimicrobial activity [3], however in this study we
saw clear inhibition of E. coli with relatively low levels
of recombinant gallin (0.25 μm) (Figure 9). Using a similar preparation of beta-defensins 4, 7 and 9, inhibition of
salmonella serovars was observed at 2 μM [37] and
human defensin 118 showed inhibition of E. coli at
around 1 μM [38]. This is further evidence for gallin as
a member of the defensins. Defensins are know to work
better at lower concentrations of NaCl [39], the concentration used in this analysis was relatively high at
170 mM suggesting the activity of gallin might be even
greater at lower concentrations of NaCl. The concentration of sodium ions in egg white is around 63 mM [40].

Conclusion
To summarise we have examined the evolution of a new
family of peptides, the ovodefensins. We have examined
in detail the biology of gallin, the chicken representative
of this family, which is most abundantly expressed in

Gong et al. BMC Immunology 2010, 11:12
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2172/11/12

oviduct tissues, consistent with proteomic observations.
The family contains a number of features which suggests it is part of the defensin family and is probably
related to the beta-defensins, perhaps having diverged
from a common ancestor at the time the avian betadefensins evolved. The categorisation of defensins is
based to some extent on the cysteine spacing and this
family would represent a new variation on the known
beta-defensins [7]. In the chicken and possibly other
avian lineages there is evidence for relatively recent
duplication of the gene with a surprising level of conservation within the species. All these forms are expressed,
and overall the highest expression is in the tubular
secretory cells of the magnum of the oviduct as
expected. Whether the recent duplication is an adaptation to increase quantities of expression or, alternatively,
we are just catching a snap shot of evolution in action
providing the tools for evolution of peptides with different specificity is unknown. We observed no evidence of
copy number variation with all animals and lines examined containing all 3 forms but it may still exist. Lastly
we have demonstrated that the peptide has potent antimicrobial activity against E. coli which may indicate new
uses for these peptides and increases our understanding
of the antimicrobial strategies of the avian innate
immune system.
