Abstract
Background: Phylogenomic analyses recently became popular to address questions about deep
metazoan phylogeny. Ribosomal proteins (RP) dominate many of these analyses or are, in some
cases, the only genes included. Despite initial hopes, phylogenomic analyses including tens to
hundreds of genes still fail to robustly place many bilaterian taxa.
Results: Using the phylogenetic position of myzostomids as an example, we show that phylogenies
derived from RP genes and mitochondrial genes produce incongruent results. Whereas the former
support a position within a clade of platyzoan taxa, mitochondrial data recovers an annelid affinity,
which is strongly supported by the gene order data and is congruent with morphology. Using
hypothesis testing, our RP data significantly rejects the annelids affinity, whereas a platyzoan
relationship is significantly rejected by the mitochondrial data.
Conclusion: We conclude (i) that reliance of a set of markers belonging to a single class of
macromolecular complexes might bias the analysis, and (ii) that concatenation of all available data
might introduce conflicting signal into phylogenetic analyses. We therefore strongly recommend
testing for data incongruence in phylogenomic analyses. Furthermore, judging all available data, we
consider the annelid affinity hypothesis more plausible than a possible platyzoan affinity for
myzostomids, and suspect long branch attraction is influencing the RP data. However, this
hypothesis needs further confirmation by future analyses.

Background
Molecular phylogenies based on a single or a few genes
often lead to apparently conflicting signals. Violation of
orthology assumption, biases leading to non-phyloge-

netic signal, and stochastic error related to gene length
might be problematic [1]. Use of phylogenomics (molecular phylogenetic studies using a genome-scale approach)
has been thought to overcome these problems, and "endPage 1 of 11

ing incongruence" was in sight [2]. However, poor taxon
sampling [3] and systematic error that is positively misleading [4] can cause phylogenomic analyses to yield
incorrect trees with high support.
Use of phylogenomic analyses to address deep metazoan
relationships has recently increased. Many of these analyses consist of concatenated sets of ribosomal proteins
(RP) [5-8] or of data sets dominated by RP data [3]. RP
genes are highly expressed and therefore often outnumber
other genes in EST-data sets. They are assumed to be
largely free of paralogy across metazoans [9,10] and as
such seem to represent good candidates for phylogenetic
analyses.
The phylogenetic position of myzostomids, parasitic
organisms typically found on echinoderms, has been
highly disputed over centuries, and possible relationships
with flatworms [11] or syndermatans [12] have been suggested by single gene analyses. However, analyses of mitochondrial gene order and sequence data show strong
evidence that myzostomids are part of the annelid radiation [13], a result that is congruent with morphological
investigations [14]. These results are contrasted by phylogenomic analyses based on an EST-borne 150 gene dataset [15] that group myzostomids within a clade of
platyzoan taxa including flatworms, rotifers, gnathostomulids, and gastrotrichs. Nevertheless, the position of
Myzostomida, and some other taxa, has been regarded as
unstable, and Dunn et al. [15] excluded these taxa from
further analyses with these EST data. Taxa that defy robust
phylogenetic placement are called "problematic taxa"
[16].
Here we compare analyses of two independent datasets to
elucidate the phylogenetic position of Myzostomida: RP
genes and mitochondrial genomes. We show that markers
belonging to a single class of macromolecular complexes
might bias the analysis and discuss implications for phylogenomic analyses in general.

Results and discussion
Analysing an alignment consisting of 77 RP genes, the
best tree of the ML-analysis (Figure 1) supports monophyly of Myzostomida (ML-bootstrap-support (MLB)
100%). They are recovered as sister group of the gastrotrich Turbanella (support <50%), and together placed in a
clade containing platyzoan taxa with long branches,
including Syndermata (Acanthocephala + Rotifera) and
Platyhelminthes (support <50%). Annelids (including
echiurids and sipunculids) are recovered as monophyletic
(MLB 78%). To test if this result is driven by only few
genes, we performed two partition jackknifing analyses
where we generated 100 concatenated datasets containing
either 35 or 50 randomly drawn gene partitions. ML anal-

yses of all these 200 newly generated datasets were conducted. We found by calculating the branch attachment
frequency (BAF) for Myzostomida using Phyutilitly [17],
that myzostomids group with Turbanella in 33% of the 35gene datasets, and in 41% of the 50 gene dataset (see
Additional File 1). Alternatively, myzostomids grouped as
sister to Bilateria (24%/13%), with gnathostumulids
(24%/22%), or with chaetognaths (8%/17%). Interestingly, these taxa are suspected of having high rates of
nucleotide substitution. In none of these analyses did
myzostomids group with annelids. These analyses also
shows that the high amount of missing data (as typical for
EST-based datasets), seems to have no influence regarding
the phylogenetic position of the myzostomids.
These results were additionally supported by a Bayesian
analysis under a site-heterogeneous model (see Additional File 1). Congruent to the ML-analysis, myzostomids grouped with Turbanella and cluster between longbranched platyzoan taxa. Additionally, we performed
hypothesis-testing to evaluate if single gene topologies are
congruent with the best ML tree of the initial concatenated
77-RP analysis. For these analyses, we pruned taxa missing
in single gene datasets from the best tree and used these
trees as a constraint for ML-analyses. Using AU-tests as
implemented in CONSEL [18], we found that all 77 single
gene analyses are congruent with the best tree. Moreover,
the AU-test significantly rejects monophyly of a clade consisting of Myzostomida and Annelida sensu lato (s.l.)
when analysing the complete dataset. Summarising these
analyses, the RP dataset weakly supports a platyzoan/
myzostomid association, without any support for an
annelid origin. This relationship was also suggested by
earlier molecular analyses based on a few genes [11,12].
For the second data set, we sequenced another nearly
complete mitochondrial genome. Within myzostomids,
two major clades can be identified [19], and both are represented by the available myzostomids mitochondrial
genomes (Endomyzostoma sp. reported here and Myzostoma
seymourcollegiorum from Bleidorn et al. [13]). The gene
order (Figure 2) of the endoparasitic Endomyzostoma species is similar to that of the ectocommensal Myzostoma seymourcollegiorum and as such reveals an order of protein
coding and rRNA genes which is identical to the conserved
pattern of (most) annelids, while no other animal taxon
shares this pattern with myzostomids and annelids
[13,20,21].
ML-analysis of the 78-taxa mitochondrial genome dataset
(Figure 3), including data for three myzostomids (the two
mentioned above, plus mitochondrial genes found in the
EST-library of Myzostoma cirriferum), recovers monophyletic Myzostomida (MLB 100%) as sister group to all
other annelids (MLB <50%). Included platyzoan taxa

Mitochondrial gene order of Myzostoma seymourcollegiorum compared with annelids
Mitochondrial gene order of Myzostoma seymourcollegiorum compared with annelids. Protein-coding genes and
ribosomal RNA genes were identified by blasting on the NCBI Entrez databases. Transfer RNA genes were identified by their
potential secondary structures using the tRNAscan-SE Search Server (Lowe and Eddy 1997). Identical patterns between taxa
are highlighted. Abbreviations are as follow: ATP synthase subunits (atp6, atp8) cytochrome c oxidase subunits (cox1-cox3),
apocytochrome b (cob), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ubiquinone oxireductase subunits (nad1-nad6), small and large
ribosomal subunit (rrnS, rrnL). Transfer RNA genes are denominated by the corresponding amino acid (one letter code).

(Platyhelminthes, Acanthocephala, Rotifera) form a
monophyletic group (MLB 81%). Very similar results are
revealed by Bayesian analysis under a site-heterogeneous
model (see Additional File 1). Here, a clade containing
Annelida s.l. and Myzostomida is supported by a posterior probability of 1.0.
Using hypothesis testing, we were able to significantly
reject monophyly of a clade containing platyzoan taxa
(Platyhelminthes and Syndermata) and Myzostomida.
The conflict regarding the phylogenetic position of
myzostomids between analyses of the RP and the mitochondrial dataset is obvious – but only one of these
hypotheses can be true. Consistent with the mitochondrial data, an annelid affinity is also supported by the
nuclear Myosin II gene [13], Hox genes [22], and is in line
with morphological data [14,23-25].

When accepting the results of the RP analyses, we have to
assume convergent evolution of many morphological
characters (e.g. chaetae, parapodia, trochophore larvae)
and an exceptional case of convergence in mitochondrial
gene order between annelids and myzostomids. In the
other case, we have to assume that 77 RP genes are misleading phylogenetic analysis. Reasons for incongruence
between markers might be either biological (e.g., selection, incomplete lineage sorting), or methodological (e.g.,
inaccurate phylogenetic reconstruction due to model misspecification) [26,27]. In the case of lineage sorting we
would expect mixed signal when comparing the 77 RP
genes. But this is not the case, as there is not any support
for an annelid affinity in this dataset. Due to lack of concordance in the taxon sampling we were not able to combine both sets of markers into a single supermatrix and as
such methods estimating species trees from gene trees
(e.g. BEST, [28]) were not applicable. However, Ewing et

al. [29] found no evidence that lineage sorting is misleading phylogenetic reconstruction by analysing a 216 gene
deep metazoan phylogeny dataset.
But it might not be far fetched that analyses of RP genes
are misleading. It has been shown that phylogenetic analyses of rRNA genes are affected by long-branch attraction
regarding the position of myzostomids [13], and co-evolution between ribosomal proteins and its rRNA binding
sites have been already demonstrated [30]. Moreover, in a
phylogenomic analysis regarding Ecdysozoa, analysing
different macromolecular complexes individually recover
different hypotheses (e.g., RP genes supported a different
hypothesis than Chaperonins) [31]. Another study on the
same topic found that ribosomal proteins might be misleading due to evolutionary biases [10]. The existence of
systematic functional or structural signal that competes
with ancestral signal has been recently demonstrated for
phylogenetic datasets [32].
Analyses by Rokas et al. [2] suggested that combining
many genes in large molecular datasets will overcome
problems of single gene analyses and end incongruence
[33]. Despite these hopes, subsequent analysis using phylogenomic datasets [3,15] largely supported the backbone
of the "New animal phylogeny" [34], but failed to resolve
the phylogenetic position of many so-called problematic
taxa [15,35,36]. Moreover, such analyses disagree in
resolving relationships at the base of the metazoan tree
[15,37].
In the case of myzostomids, our analyses show that different marker sets can resolve different topologies and usage
of complete macromolecular complexes might bring conflicting signal into supermatrices and as such mislead
analyses. Interestingly, we do not find any conflict within
our RP dataset, but all incongruence is between both sets
of markers. As such, reliance on a set of sequences belonging to a single macromolecular complex might give a
biased picture, as these genes might share a common evolutionary bias. This holds true for either mitochondrial or
ribosomal proteins. For future work, we strongly recommend careful inspection of phylogenomic datasets for
incongruent signals [38,39] in order to refine phylogenomic analyses, as this might be the key for the placement
of so-called problematic taxa.

Conclusion
Analysing a 77 gene RP-dataset, we found that a grouping
of myzostomids within platyzoan taxa is favoured. Statistical tests have shown that this is congruent with every single gene partition of this dataset and jackknifing analysis
with subsequent investigation of the branch attachment
frequency of myzostomids revealed no sign of support for
an annelid affinity. Contrasting these results, analyses of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/150

mitochondrial sequences support an annelid affinity for
myzostomids. This result is in line with some nuclear
genes (Myosin II, Hox genes) and morphology, and is
strongly supported by mitochondrial gene order and as
such we consider this hypothesis more plausible than a
possible platyzoan affinity.
Irrespective of which hypothesis will confirmed by future
analyses, we conclude (i) that reliance of a set of markers
belonging to a single class of macromolecular complexes
might bias the analysis, and (ii) that concatenation of all
data might introduce conflicting signal into the analyses.
We therefore strongly recommend testing for data incongruence in phylogenomic analyses, as this might be the
key for robust phylogenetic placement of problematic
taxa.

Methods
Individuals of Myzostoma cirriferum were collected from its
host, the crinoid Antedon bifida, sampled in Morgat
(France). Total RNA of ~100 frozen individuals was
extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). An amplified cDNA library was
constructed at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular
Genetics in Berlin using CloneMiner (Invitrogen). cDNA
was size fractioned and directional cloned using the vector
pDNR-LIB. Clones containing cDNA inserts were
sequenced from the 5' end on the automated capillary
sequencer systems ABI 3730 XL (Applied Biosystems,
Darmstadt, Germany) and MegaBace 4500 (GE Healthcare, München, Germany) using BigDye chemistry. EST
processing was done at the Center for Integrative Bioinformatics in Vienna. Sequencing chromatograms were evaluated using Phred [40,41]. Vector-, adapter-, poly-A-, and
bacterial sequences were removed using Lucy [42], SeqClean [43], and CrossMatch [44]. Sequences were then
clustered and assembled using the TIGCL package [43] by
performing pairwise comparisons (MGIBlast) and a subsequent clustering using CAP3 [45]. All M. cirriferum EST's
have been deposited in the EMBL sequence database [46].
We generated an additional nearly complete mitochondrial genome for the endoparasitic myzostomid
Endomyzostoma sp. Individuals were collected in Antarctic
peninsula region area by dredge from the R/V Laurence M.
Gould and frozen at -80°C after collection. Total genomic
DNA extractions employed the DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacture's instructions. The
genome of Endomyzostoma sp. was amplified in four overlapping fragments. First, we used taxonomically inclusive
primers [47] to amplify the conserved regions of mLSU,
cox1, cob and nad5 genes. PCR products were purified
using QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and
sequenced using a CEQ8000 (Beckmann). Three pairs of
specific long-PCR primers (Table 1) were designed to

amplify these long fragments: cox1-cob, cob-nad5 and
nad5-mLSU. Long PCRs were employed on Eppendorf
Mastercycler (Eppendorf) PCR machines using Takara LATaq PCR System. 50 μl long PCR reactions were set up
including 5 μl 10×buffer, 8 μl dNTP (2 mM), 5 μl MgCl2
(25 mM), 2 μl of each long PCR specific primers (10 μM
each), 0.5 μl Takara LA-Taq (5 U/μl), 2 μl DNA template
and 25.5 μl sterilized distilled water. The long PCR protocol was 94°C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles with 94°C
for 30 sec, 53 or 54°C for 30 s, and 70°C for 12 min; final
extension at 72°C for 10 min and hold at 4°C. The cox1cob fragment was around 8 kb; the cob-nad5 was 2 kb,
while nad5-mLSU was about 4.5 kb in size. These three
fragments were purified using QiaQuick Gel Extraction
Kit (Qiagen) and then cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector
(Promega). Positive clones were screened by PCRs and
plasmids were isolated by QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit
(Qiagen). Then EcoRI was used to digest the isolated plasmids to check the insert size. Primer walking was
employed to sequence this plasmid with large inserts.
Sequences were joined together and edited using DNASTAR™ Lasergene programs SeqMan and MegAlign [48].
Blast searches were used to identify protein-coding genes
and ribosomal RNA genes; tRNA genes were identified
using tRNAscan-SE web server [49] under default settings
and source = "mito/chloroplast", or drawn by hand based
on their potential secondary structures and anticodon
sequences. The GenBank accession number for the partial
mitochondrial genome is FJ975144.
Phylogenetic analyses of the ribosomal protein dataset
We used the published alignments [5,7] as backbone for
our analysis. Human ribosomal protein genes retrieved
from the Ribosomal Protein Gene Database [50] as search
template for local tblastN searches using an e value <e-10
as threshold value for matches. We searched our EST-data
of M. cirriferum, as well as selected EST-processed (Table
2) taxa from the NCBI trace archive [46] and the EST Database [51] for ribosomal proteins. All sequences were
translated into amino acids using the program Wise2 [52].

Alignments of 77 single ribosomal genes were generated
using MAFFT [53]. The software REAP [54] was subse-

quently used to mask all alignments prior to computing
phylogenies: columns with many gaps or highly diverse
amino acids were removed from the peptide alignments.
A concatenated alignment of all 77 single gene alignments
was constructed. The alignment has been deposited at
treebase [55].
We used the AIC as implemented in ProtTest 1.3 [56] for
model selection of the concatenated dataset. For Maximum Likelihood (ML) analysis, we used RAxML [57] with
the PROTGAMMARTREV model to analyse single gene
partitions, as well as the concatenated dataset. The concatenated dataset was analysed using mixed models for 77
single gene partitions. Clade stability was estimated by
100 replicates of non-parametric bootstrapping.
In a second step, we performed partition jackknifing analyses where we generated 100 concatenated datasets each
containing either 35 or 50 randomly drawn gene partitions. ML analyses of all these 200 newly generated datasets were analysed under mixed models with the settings
as described above. We calculated the Branch Attachment
Frequency (BAF) for Myzostomida using Phyutilitly [17]
for the 100 35-gene datasets, as well as for the 100 50gene datasets. BAF visualizes alternative positions of particular taxa across a set of trees.
We conducted Bayesian inference based on the site-heterogeneous CAT model using PhyloBayes v2.1c [58]. Two
independent chains were run were run for 17814 and
14209 points. To check for convergence, the program
bpcomp [58] was used to compare the bipartitions
between the two runs. With a burn-in of 1000 and taking
every two trees, the largest discrepancy observed between
bipartitions was 0.129. After discarding the burn-in, a
majority rule consensus tree was computed using both
chains to approximate posterior probabilities. We performed hypothesis testing to evaluate if single gene topologies are congruent with the best ML tree of the
concatenated (77 gene) analysis. For these analyses, we
pruned taxa missing in single gene datasets from the best
tree and used these trees as a constraint for ML-analyses of
single gene ribosomal protein datasets using RAxML, ver.
7.03 [57] with parameters described above. We computed

per-site log-likelihoods with RAxML for both, the topology inferred by the single gene analysis and the constrained topology from the best tree, and used an AU-test
as implemented in CONSEL [18] to test if these hypotheses differ significantly. Moreover, we constrained the
monophyly of clade consisting of Annelida sensu lato (i.e.
including echiurids, siboglinids, and sipunculids) and
myzostomids and tested with the method mentioned
above if this hypothesis differs significantly from the best
tree.
Phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial genome sequences
Amino acid alignments of protein-coding genes from 78
complete and partial mitochondrial genomes (Table 3)
were computed using ClustalW as implemented in Bioedit
ver. 7.0.1 [59]. Mitochondrial sequences were downloaded from OGRe database [60]. Additionally, we performed BLAST searches to find mitochondrial genes
within the newly generated EST-library of Myzostoma cirriferum.

Gblocks, ver. 0.91 [61] was used to identify unambiguously aligned proportions of the alignments. Parameters
used were: minimum number of sequences for a conserved position = 41, minimum number of sequences for
a flank position: 41, maximum number of contiguous
non-conserved positions: 8, minimum length of a block:
10, allowed gap positions: with half, use similarity matrix:
yes. Gblocks treatment recovered 51% of the original
alignment, leading to a concatenated alignment of 2295
amino acids, with all genes except atp8 being partially represented in the final alignment. The alignment has been
deposited at treebase [55].

Maximum likelihood analysis was performed with
RaxML, ver. 7.03 [57]. MtRev + CAT was chosen as model
for amino acid substitutions. The dataset was partitioned
according to single gene sequences, so that model parameters and amino acid frequencies were optimized for each
single gene alignment. 100 bootstrap replicates were performed to infer the support of clades from the best tree.
Additionally, we constrained monophyly of a clade containing myzostomids and platyzoan taxa (Plathyhelminthes + Syndermata) and used hypothesis as
described above, if this clade is significantly rejected when
compared with the best tree.

We conducted Bayesian inference based on the site-heterogeneous CAT model using PhyloBayes v2.1c [58] as
described above. Two independent chains were run were
run for 26739 and 26660 points. With a burn-in of 15000
and taking every two trees, the largest discrepancy
observed between bipartitions was 0.107.

Authors' contributions
CB conducted labwork for subsequent generation of the
Myzostoma EST-library at the MPI for Molecular Genetics
in Berlin (Germany). MZ did all PCR experiments and
sequencing of the mitochondrial genome and annotated
the genome. CB, LP and SH performed phylogenetic analysis of sequence data. CB, KMH and RT conceived and
supervised this study. CB drafted the manuscript, all other
