Abstract
Background: Vertebrate odorant receptors comprise at least three types of G protein-coupled
receptors (GPCRs): the OR, V1R, and V2R/V2R-like receptors, the latter group belonging to the
C family of GPCRs. These receptor families are thought to receive chemosensory information from
a wide spectrum of odorant and pheromonal cues that influence critical animal behaviors such as
feeding, reproduction and other social interactions.
Results: Using genome database mining and other informatics approaches, we identified and
characterized the repertoire of 54 intact "V2R-like" olfactory C family GPCRs in the zebrafish.
Phylogenetic analysis – which also included a set of 34 C family GPCRs from fugu – places the fish
olfactory receptors in three major groups, which are related to but clearly distinct from other C
family GPCRs, including the calcium sensing receptor, metabotropic glutamate receptors, GABAB receptor, T1R taste receptors, and the major group of V2R vomeronasal receptor families.
Interestingly, an analysis of sequence conservation and selective pressure in the zebrafish receptors
revealed the retention of a conserved sequence motif previously shown to be required for ligand
binding in other amino acid receptors.
Conclusion: Based on our findings, we propose that the repertoire of zebrafish olfactory C family
GPCRs has evolved to allow the detection and discrimination of a spectrum of amino acid and/or
amino acid-based compounds, which are potent olfactory cues in fish. Furthermore, as the major
groups of fish receptors and mammalian V2R receptors appear to have diverged significantly from
a common ancestral gene(s), these receptors likely mediate chemosensation of different classes of
chemical structures by their respective organisms.

Background
The vertebrate olfactory system receives and decodes sensory information from a myriad chemical cues. The first
step in this process is the recognition of these cues by
receptors expressed by the primary sensory neurons in the
olfactory epithelium (reviewed in refs. [1,2]). Receptormediated activity within the population of olfactory sen-

sory neurons is then interpreted by the brain to identify
the molecular nature of the odorant stimulus. A large multigene family thought to encode odorant receptors was
initially identified in the rat [3] and belong to what is now
referred to as the "OR" superfamily of odorant receptors
(reviewed in [4]). The predicted structure of these receptors exhibits a seven transmembrane domain topology

characteristic of the "A family" or rhodopsin class of G
protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The size of the OR
gene family in mammals is extremely large and is estimated to contain over 1000 individual genes in some species [5-9]. In the fish, the size of the OR repertoire appears
to be much smaller and appears to contain only ~40 to
~140 genes, depending on the species examined [10,11].
More recently, members of the trace amine-associated
receptor (TAAR) family were shown to be expressed in
mouse olfactory neurons and are thought to mediate the
reception of amine-based chemosensory cues [12].
Two types of GPCRs unrelated to the OR or TAAR families
are expressed in the mammalian vomeronasal organ: the
V1R receptors [13,14] and the V2R receptors [15-18]. The
V1R receptors are expressed within the subpopulation of
Gαi-expressing VNO sensory neurons [14]. Genome-wide
surveys have revealed the presence of approximately 100
V1R genes in the mouse genome [6,13]. The V2R receptors
belong to the "C family" of GPCRs, which includes the
metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR), extracellular
calcium sensing receptors (CaSR), and GABA-B receptors
[19]. Members of this receptor family are characterized by
their long N-terminal extracellular domain, which contains the primary determinants for ligand binding
[20,21]). The mouse and rat genomes each encode
approximately 60 V2R genes [18]; these receptors are
expressed in the subclass of Gαo-expressing neurons in a
pattern complementary to V1R/Gαi expression [15-17].
Because of their expression in the vomeronasal organ – a
structure specialized for the detection of non-volatile cues,
including pheromones – the V1R and V2R receptors have
been widely postulated to represent pheromone receptors
(reviewed by [4]). Indeed, a number of studies have demonstrated that specific V1R- and V2R-expressing vomeronasal neurons respond to known pheromones [22-24];
however, formal proof that the V1R and V2R are pheromone receptors awaits a direct demonstration of ligandreceptor interactions between such compounds and these
receptors.
In the fish, receptors belonging to the C family of GPCRs
have been shown to be expressed in the olfactory epithelium [25-27]. The olfactory C family GPCRs are expressed
by the subpopulation of microvillous sensory neurons in
the fish's single olfactory organ, distinct from the ciliated
sensory neurons which express members of the OR family
of odorant receptors [25,27]. Significantly, two orthologous receptors from the goldfish and zebrafish (called
receptor 5.24 and receptor ZO6, respectively) are activated
by amino acids [27,28], which are potent feeding cues in
fish [29-31]. These observations raise the possibility that
the olfactory C family GPCRs as a group represent a family
of amino acid-sensing receptors in teleost fish.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/309

To gain insights into the evolution and function of olfactory C family GPCRs, we performed an analysis of this
receptor gene family in the zebrafish, Danio rerio. Through
genome database mining of the zebrafish genome
sequence provided by the Sanger Institute Danio rerio
Sequencing Project, we identified and characterized the
complete repertoire of olfactory C family GPCRs. Our
analysis identified 62 genes (54 encoding intact, fulllength receptors), which can be divided into 21 subfamilies. Although two of the intact zebrafish receptor
genes appear to be orthologous to mammalian V2R or
V2R-like genes, the major group of zebrafish receptors
form a clade distinct from the mammalian V2R receptors.
In addition, our analysis of the zebrafish receptors
revealed – in all family members – a conserved signature
motif previously shown to be involved in ligand binding
in other amino acid-sensing receptors [32,33]. In contrast,
other amino acid positions predicted to form contact sites
in the ligand binding pocket show marked divergence
within the zebrafish receptor family. Together these observations suggest that the zebrafish olfactory C family
GPCRs comprise a family of receptors that has evolved to
recognize a diverse array of amino acid and/or amino
acid-based ligands.

Results and discussion
Prediction of zebrafish OlfC genes
The second (Zv2) and third (Zv3) draft zebrafish genome
assemblies [34] of whole genome shotgun sequence (5.7×
coverage) were searched for OlfC gene sequences using
homology to known fish OlfC proteins as a guide. A final
search of the sixth draft assembly (Zv6) with the identified
OlfC genes revealed no additional sequences. The resulting genes were then mapped to the Zv6 assembly.

In contrast to the typically uninterrupted coding sequence
of OR genes, the intron-exon structure of the genes encoding the C family GPCRs comprises a minimum of 6 exons
(e.g., see ref. [35]). Our gene prediction strategy was to
combine a low-threshold BLAST search with profile Hidden Markov Model-(HMM) based gene prediction with
the program Genewise [36]. This process was repeated in
an iterative fashion, as follows. The zebrafish genome
assembly was subjected to TBLASTN search using known
full-length olfactory C family GPCRs from zebrafish, goldfish and fugu. Initial query sequences included goldfish
olfactory receptors 5.24, 5.3, GFB1, and GFB8, zebrafish
ZO6, and fugu Ca02.1, Ca09, Ca12, Ca13 and Ca15.1
[25-27]. The gene prediction program Genewise was then
run on the genomic sequences surrounding each unique
BLAST hit using a profile hidden Markov model (HMM)
of the gene family (see Methods for details). The Genewise
predictions were examined manually and extended to
appropriate start and stop codons based on alignment of
the amino acid translation to known or previously pre-

dicted olfactory C family GPCR sequences. Splice site predictions were also edited when possible to minimize the
occurrence of gaps at splice junctions in the alignment
and maintain intron positions with respect to the amino
acid sequence alignment. At this stage, predicted genes
highly similar to the CaSR, mGluRs and T1Rs were set
apart from the putative olfactory sequences. In each
round, the newly-predicted genes were added as queries
for the next BLAST search, and a new profile HMM was
constructed for use in the next round of gene prediction.
The family of putative olfactory C family GPCRs is designated "OlfC" for Olfactory C family GPCR (see below for
discussion regarding nomenclature).
OlfC gene sequences were considered intact if they 1)
begin with a signal sequence, 2) end in a stop codon after
the seventh predicted transmembrane domain, 3) show
significant alignment to all six stereotypical OlfC exons,
and 4) possess no internal frame shifts, significant deletions (excluding those caused by gaps in the genome
assembly) or stop codons. Predicted genes were categorized as full-length pseudogenes if they at met the first
three criteria but failed the fourth. Sequences were considered partial genes if they failed one of the first three criteria but met the fourth. Finally, predicted genes were
considered partial pseudogenes if they failed all four criteria.
Using these criteria, our search identified 54 intact OlfC
genes, 2 partial genes, 3 full-length pseudogenes and 1
partial pseudogene, for a total of 60 sequences. Two additional partial pseudogenes (too small to meet our length
threshold) were recently reported by Hashiguchi and
Nishida [37]; see below). We therefore included them in
the total count of 62 OlfC genes (Table 1; [see Additional
files 1, 2, 3, 4]) but excluded them from further analysis.
All full-length genes exhibit a conserved gene structure,
with the protein coding sequence encoded by 6 exons [see
Additional file 5]. Variation in exon length is evident,
even within individual subfamilies, although variation in
exon length is greater between subfamilies [see Additional
file 3]. Interestingly, however, the phases of intron/exon
boundaries within codons are strictly conserved across all
members of the family [see Additional file 3].
A recent study based on the 4th assembly of the draft
zebrafish genome (Zv4) identified a total of 89 OlfC
sequences, including 38 partial sequences [37]. Forty of
the 89 sequences appear to have frame shifts or stop
codons. We ascribe the discrepancies with our results in
part to the difference in genome assemblies used for the
two analyses (Zv4 alone vs. the Zv2, Zv3 and Zv6 assemblies used here). In the present analysis, we found that
many of the non-overlapping sequences previously identified as distinct genes [37] in fact map to a smaller set of

a Intact genes are defined as those sequences that 1) contain a leading
signal sequence, 2) end in a stop codon after the seventh predicted
transmembrane domain, 3) show significant alignment to all six
stereotypical OlfC exons, and 4) possess no internal frame shifts,
significant deletions (excluding those caused by gaps in the genome
assembly) or stop codons.
b Partial genes comprise those sequences that fail one of the first
three criteria (above) but meet the fourth.
c Sequences are categorized as full-length pseudogenes if they meet
the first three criteria but fail the fourth.
d Sequences that fail to meet all four criteria are categorized as partial

common, intact genes (note the clustering of multiple,
previous gene designations to single identified genes in
[see Additional file 2]). We also found that all full-length
OlfC gene sequences have a conserved gene structure [see
Additional file 3]; previously reported variations to this
organization [37] are likely due to sequencing errors in
earlier genome assemblies and inaccuracies in gene predictions. Overall, our analysis identified all but two pseudogenes found in [37] plus an additional three intact
genes, one partial gene and one full-length pseudogene.
Based on these observations and the higher quality of our
gene models (as evidenced by the greater proportion of
complete gene sequences in the present analysis), we
believe that our study provides a more accurate representation of the zebrafish OlfC gene family.
In addition to the 62 OlfC sequences described above, our
analysis also identified other C family GPCRs in the
zebrafish genome: one putative calcium sensing receptor
and 4 T1R-like putative taste receptors. Our search for
these other receptor sequences was not exhaustive, however; it is therefore possible that additional paralogs of
these receptors escaped identification in our analysis.
Nonetheless, it is interesting to note that the four T1R-like
receptors are highly similar to the three previously-identified classes of T1R taste receptors in mammals [38-41]:
T1R1 (zebrafish T1Ra), T1R2 (zebrafish T1Rb1 and
T1Rb2), and T1R3 (zebrafish T1Rc) (see below).
The identity of the OlfC gene family as a bona fide olfactory receptor family was confirmed by RNA in situ hybridizations. Probes for 46 intact OlfC genes were hybridized
individually to zebrafish olfactory epithelium (T. Alioto,
P. Luu, E. VanName, J. Fan, J. Ngai, unpublished results;

[see Additional file 2]). Of this group, 42 gave detectable
signal in olfactory sensory neurons. Forty probes localized
to cells in a punctate pattern consistent with the expression of one or a few receptor genes per neuron. Two receptors, OlfCa1 and OlfCc1, exhibited broad expression in a
large fraction of neurons. These receptors are orthologous
to goldfish receptors 5.24 and 5.3, respectively, which
were previously shown to be expressed widely in the goldfish olfactory epithelium [27]. OlfCc1 and goldfish receptor 5.3 are orthologous to the mammalian V2R2
vomeronasal receptor, which is expressed in a large fraction of vomeronasal neurons and co-expressed with other
"punctate" V2R receptors [16]. Together our results suggest that OlfCa1 and OlfCc1 – which comprise two clades
distinct from the main group of zebrafish OlfC receptors
(see below) – are the two broadly expressed receptors of
the repertoire and are co-expressed with a single "punctate" receptor in each sensory neuron.
OlfC nomenclature and classification
Olfactory receptors belonging to the "OR" superfamily
have been classified into monophyletic groups, with family members sharing greater than 40% amino acid identity
and subfamily members sharing greater than 60% amino
acid identity [42]. In the case of the zebrafish OlfC genes,
we found that a subfamily threshold of 65% amino acid
identity worked best for the generation of monophyletic
clades, which we believe correspond to groups of recently
duplicated OlfC genes. Using this threshold as an operational guideline, we classified the zebrafish OlfC genes
into 21 subfamilies, with 17 containing full-length OlfC
gene sequences [see Additional file 2] (see below for phylogenetic reconstructions). The average percent identity
between subfamilies is approximately 46%, with the maximum observed percent identity between any two OlfCs
of different subfamilies being 61%. The average percent
identity among members within a subfamily is ~81%,
with the minimum identity between any two members of
any subfamily being 72%.

To unify the naming for zebrafish OlfC genes, we propose
a revised nomenclature based on the following rationale.
First, the prefix "OlfC" was adopted as the designation for
the Olfactory C family GPCRs identified in this and previous studies. In addition to reflecting the olfactory-specific
nature of these receptors, this designation is consistent
with our phylogenetic analysis (see below), which indicates that the OlfC receptors form a family distinct from
other C family GPCRs, including the mammalian V2R
receptors. Both newly-predicted and previously-described
zebrafish OlfC genes were named (or re-named) according to subfamily membership. Subfamilies were designated by letters starting with "a" and ending with "y"
(skipping "i," "l," "o," and "p"). Within subfamilies, OlfCs
were numbered sequentially according to genomic posi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/309

tion, if known. The new nomenclature showing subfamily
membership and correspondence to previously-identified
zebrafish OlfC genes is shown in Supplementary Materials
[see Additional file 2].
Genomic distribution of zebrafish OlfC genes
Previous studies have demonstrated that V2R and OlfC
genes are clustered in the rodent and fugu genomes,
respectively [18,26]. In the present study, we found that
59 of the 62 identified zebrafish OlfC genes map to
known chromosomal locations (Figure 1; [see Additional
file 2]). Fifty seven genes reside in three clusters, with 39
genes on chromosome 18, 12 genes on chromosome 17,
and 6 genes on chromosome 11; one gene each localizes
to chromosome 16 and chromosome 20. From our analysis of the Zv6 genome assembly, there is little evidence
for large segmental duplications of receptor-containing
loci; we find only a few instances of apparent interchromosomal duplications resulting in subfamily members
residing on two chromosomes (subfamily g on chromosomes 17 and 18, subfamily d on chromosomes 11 and
18, and subfamily m on chromosomes 11 and 17). In
most cases, genes within a given subfamily are found in
the same chromosomal cluster and share a common transcriptional orientation. Together these observations suggest tandem duplication(s) as the primary mechanism for
expansion of the OlfC gene repertoire.

A previous analysis placed the zebrafish OlfC genes on ten
chromosomes, with two major clusters of 34 genes on
chromosome 18, 10 genes on chromosome 17, and none
on chromosome 11 [37]. However, in the present analysis
using the more recent Zv6 genome assembly, we found
that the OlfC genes with identifiable chromosomal locations map only to chromosomes 11, 16, 17, 18 and 20;
many of the genes localized by Hashiguchi and Nishida
[37] to the seven other chromosomes were partial
sequences that ultimately map to the major clusters on
chromosomes 11, 17 and 18 in the updated Zv6 genome
assembly. In addition, Hashiguchi and Nishida identified
two possible instances of recent tandem duplications
[37]: one within the cluster on chromosome 18 resulting
in a near-perfect 64 kb duplication with 3 OlfC genes, and
another between chromosomes 17 and 20, yielding an
apparent 60 kb duplication with 4 genes. However, our
analysis of these regions using the Zv2, Zv3, Zv5 and Zv6
assemblies indicates that these apparent duplications represent artifacts caused by errors in the Zv4 genome assembly. With the exception of 2 pseudogenes, all of the 89
OlfC sequences identified previously [37] were detected
with our gene mining pipeline and all of them (including
the 2 pseudogenes) are accounted for in our analysis.
Largely consistent with our gene predictions and chromosomal mapping, a more recent report by Hashiguchi and
Nishida [43] based on the Zv5 assembly identified 57

OlfC genes are clustered in the zebrafish genome. Zebrafish OlfC genes were mapped to the Zv6 draft genome assembly. Shown are the positions of predicted OlfC genes in three clusters on chromosomes 11, 17 and 18 as well as the two singlets on chromosomes 16 and 20. Subfamily members are in most cases found in contiguous clusters and often share the same
transcriptional orientation. The interrupted coding sequence of OlfCg7 (in brackets) is likely due to the unfinished state of scaffold 2506 in the Zv6 genome assembly. Also shown are non-OlfC RefSeq sequences and zebrafish mRNAs from the UCSC
genome browser [78].

zebrafish OlfC sequences (46 encoding potentially functional genes) that were localized to chromosomes 5, 17
and 18. We attribute the minor discrepancies between
[43] and our study to differences in the Zv5 and Zv6
zebrafish genome assemblies.
Phylogeny of zebrafish OlfC genes
We performed a phylogenetic analysis of the zebrafish
OlfC genes in order to determine the relationships
between members of this gene family. To this end, phylogenetic trees of the 57 full-length OlfC sequences (54
intact genes and 3 full-length pseudogenes) and other C
family GPCRs were constructed using maximum likelihood or neighbor joining algorithms (see Methods). Figure 2 shows the results of a phylogenetic reconstruction
using maximum likelihood analysis, which classifies the
full-length zebrafish OlfC genes into monophyletic clades
representing 17 subfamilies showing on average 46%
inter-subfamily identity. Assignment of genes at the subfamily level is identical using either maximum likelihood
or neighbor joining methods, although some differences
are manifested at deeper branches (data not shown). The
subfamilies in turn cluster into 3 larger groups: Group I,
the largest group, consisting of 52 intact genes and 2 fulllength pseudogenes; Group II, consisting of a single intact
gene; and Group III, containing one intact gene plus a fulllength pseudogene. All OlfC groups form clades that are
clearly distinct from the CaSR, mGluR, and T1R-like taste
receptor families. Group I and Group II genes reside on a
common branch of the phylogenetic tree; their proximity
to the calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) suggests a previous
duplication and expansion from a most recent common
ancestral gene (MRCA) shared by the present-day CaSR.

Interestingly, Group III – which contains OlfCa1, an
amino acid receptor activated by glutamate [28] – is divergent from Group I and Group II. Reconstructions using
either maximum likelihood (Figure 2) or neighbor joining (data not shown) place Group III closer to the putative
taste receptors than to the Group I and Group II OlfC
receptors, suggesting an MRCA for the T1R and Group III
receptors not shared with the Group I or Group II receptors. However, based on amino acid sequence similarity
alone, Group III is roughly equidistant from Group I/
Group II (average 31% identity) and the family of T1Rlike putative taste receptors (average 29% identity). While
this apparent discrepancy could be explained by the
longer branch lengths of the T1R family, suggestive of
accelerated functional/sequence divergence, conclusions
about the origins of the Group III OlfC receptors should
be tempered by these latter observations.
Comparison of fish OlfC and mammalian V2R receptors
To gain additional insight into the evolution of the OlfC
receptor repertoire, we compared the zebrafish OlfC

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/309

sequences to mammalian V2R receptors, OlfC receptors
identified in two other teleost fish species (goldfish and
fugu), and other C family GPCRs. Phylogenetic trees were
constructed using intact genes from zebrafish (63 genes),
mouse (72 genes), goldfish (4 genes), and fugu (34 genes)
(see Methods for the list of genes included in this analysis). A phylogenetic tree generated using maximum likelihood is shown in Figure 3. This analysis reveals that the
major group of fish OlfC genes (Group I, containing genes
from zebrafish, goldfish and fugu) is distinct from the
largest set of mammalian V2R sequences, which comprise
two related clades designated here as Group IV and Group
V (also referred to as "Family A" and Family B," respectively, in ref. [18]). Thus, the fish Group I OlfC receptors
and mammalian Group IV/V V2R receptors appear to
have diverged significantly from a common ancestral
gene(s).
Group II contains genes from zebrafish (OlfCc1), goldfish
(receptor 5.3), fugu (735220), and mouse (three genes
closely related to and including V2R2). In addition to
their sequence similarity, members of this group are
expressed broadly in their respective organisms' sensory
epithelium [27,44], reflecting a conserved mode of gene
regulation. Group III appears to contain a single receptor
in the zebrafish (OlfCa1), goldfish (receptor 5.24 [27]),
fugu (179742), or mouse (gprc6a [45]); mammalian
gprc6a shows about 40% amino acid similarity to the corresponding fish receptors in this group [45,46]. The
zebrafish, goldfish and mouse receptors in Group III have
all been shown to be activated by amino acid ligands
[27,28,47,48]. However, while the zebrafish and goldfish
genes are expressed in the olfactory epithelium, mammalian gprc6a is expressed in a number of non-olfactory tissues, but not in the olfactory system [45,46]. Thus, while
these receptors appear to be orthologous, their regulation
in tissue-specific gene expression has diverged significantly between fish and mammals.
The 19 identified fugu OlfC receptors [see Additional file
6] can be placed into 10 of the 21 subfamilies defined
above for the zebrafish (subfamilies a, c, h, j, k, q, r, t, u
and v). Four fugu receptors (744432, 611613, 594197,
and 744222) cannot be classified into these subfamilies
and thus form four fugu-specific subfamilies. We conclude from this comparison that the OlfC family had
already diverged into the present-day subfamilies in the
most recent common ancestor of the cyprinid (zebrafish
and goldfish) and pufferfish lineages, prior to the
cyprinid-pufferfish split (see also [43]). Subsequent differential gene expansion (mainly evident in the zebrafish
branch) and gene loss (more prevalent in the fugu
branch) probably occurred following speciation of these
two teleost lineages.

Phylogeny of C family GPCRs from zebrafish, fugu, goldfish and mouse. A phylogenetic tree of selected zebrafish,
fugu, goldfish and mouse C family receptors was constructed using a maximum likelihood algorithm and displayed in radial format. Groups I – V all form clades distinct from the CaSR, T1R, mGluR and GABA-B families. Most of the fish OlfC receptors
form a clade (Group I) distinct from the mouse V2R receptors (mmV2R) found in Groups II, IV and V. Group II contains both
fish OlfC receptors (zebrafish: drOlfCc1; goldfish: ca5.3; fugu: 735220) and mouse V2R2-like (mmV2R2) sequences. Group III
contains receptors from zebrafish (drOlfCa1), goldfish (ca5.24), fugu (179742) and mouse (mmGprc6a). Scale bar indicates the
number of amino acid substitution per site.

Patterns of sequence conservation and divergence
implicate the OlfC receptors as a family of amino acidbinding proteins
We next examined the patterns of sequence conservation
and divergence within the zebrafish OlfC receptor family
in order to gain insights into the possible functions of
these receptors. A sequence logo created from the alignment of full-length zebrafish OlfC amino acid sequences
highlights a number of conserved motifs among members

of the family (Figure 4). In addition to the clear conservation of the cysteine residues of the cysteine-rich domain
and heptahelical transmembrane (TM) domains (both of
which are important structural elements in this class of
GPCR), several stretches of residues in the ligand-binding
N-terminal domain (NTD) are also conserved. These NTD
residues largely correspond to secondary structure elements such as the core alpha helices in lobe 1 and the beta
strands in lobe 2, as well as sites predicted to interact with

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:309

bound ligand (see below and Figure 5). Overall, the NTD
shows less conservation than the cysteine-rich and TM
domains, consistent with these latter domains' roles in
receptor structure and coupling to intracellular signaling
pathways [49,50].
What clues about receptor function or ligand specificity
might be gleaned from an analysis of sequence conservation within the OlfC receptor family? It is instructive to
consider this question in the context of the structure of C
family GPCRs. The ligand-binding NTD of C family
GPCRs is thought to adopt a conformation resembling a
bilobate clamshell-like structure [49,50]. Stabilization of
the closed conformation of the clamshell – through interactions between bound ligand and the inner faces of the
two lobes (lobes 1 and 2) – leads to receptor activation.
For amino acid-binding receptors, the binding pocket
formed by the two lobes of the clamshell can be divided
into two regions: a proximal pocket, comprising residues
that interact with the glycine moiety of the amino acid ligand (α-carboxylate, α-amino and α-proton), and a distal
pocket, comprising residues that interact with the ligand's
R group side chain [49]. Studies on a wide variety of
amino acid-binding proteins have identified a core "signature" motif of 5 residues within the proximal binding
pocket that participate in critical interactions with the
amino acid ligand ([32,33]; see Figure 5). Thus, the presence of the ligand-binding signature motif in a given
receptor would be consistent with the receptor's possible
function in amino acid sensing. An additional 3 conserved residues predicted to be involved in structural
interactions in the hinge region have also been identified
in the amino acid receptors ([32]; see Figure 5). Although
still subject to experimental validation, together with the
core 5-site motif these latter 3 sites have been proposed to
comprise an 8 residue signature of amino acid receptors
[32].
We have shown previously [28] that the amino acid-binding core signature motif is present in goldfish receptor
5.24, a Group III OlfC receptor that is activated by amino
acids [27]; mutagenesis of any one of the 5 signature motif
residues in receptor 5.24 results in a profound decrease in
receptor activation by ligand [28,47]. The corresponding
5 amino acids in OlfCa1 (previously named ZO6), the
zebrafish ortholog of goldfish receptor 5.24 that is also
activated by amino acids, are fully conserved [28]. We
were therefore interested in determining to what extent
the amino acid-binding signature motif is conserved
within the zebrafish OlfC receptor family, and by inference whether the OlfC receptors may constitute a family
of amino acid receptors.
We addressed this issue using two tools for mapping
amino acid substitutions to relevant sites in the receptor

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/309

structure: (1) a sequence logo representation of residues
predicted from our previous structure-function studies
[28] to be involved in amino acid binding, including the
aforementioned 8 residue signature motif (Figure 5), and
(2) a representation of conservation and divergence overlaid on our structural model for the ligand-binding NTD
of OlfCa1 (Figure 6; [28]). Three salient features are evident from this analysis. First, the 8 residue signature motif
(S150, S/T173, R188, D193, Q196, Y221, G222, D/E307
in OlfCa1 coordinates) is highly conserved in the
zebrafish OlfC family (Figure 5), as well as in the fugu
OlfC receptors [see Additional file 6]. Similarly, a high
level of conservation is seen for residues forming the surface of the proximal binding pocket (Figure 6). These
observations suggest that the OlfC receptors as a group are
capable of binding to amino acids and their derivatives.
Second, a sequence logo of the mouse V2R receptors (Figure 5) shows that, with the exception of the Group II V2R2
receptor(s), the amino acid-binding signature motif is
absent from the mammalian V2R receptors. Since the signature motif is strictly required for amino acid binding in
all C family GPCRs identified to date [32], Group IV and
Group V V2R receptors have likely evolved to receive nonamino acid stimuli; the probable functional divergence of
the V2R and OlfC receptors mirrors the phylogenetic
divergence of these two receptor families (Figure 3). What,
then, are the cognate ligands for the V2R receptors? Recent
studies have implicated the V2R receptors in detecting
MHC peptides and other conspecific peptide cues [22,51].
We speculate that since such peptides are likely too large
to fit within the conventional clamshell binding pocket,
they may instead activate the receptor by allosteric interactions on the exterior of the NTD or cysteine-rich
domain, similar to the allosteric activation of T1R sweet
receptors by peptide sweeteners [52]. It should be noted
that fish also appear to choose mating partners based on
MHC haplotype, presumably via an olfactory-mediated
process [53]; the OlfC receptors may therefore mediate
chemoreception of peptide cues via such allosteric interactions, distinct from "orthosteric" ligand binding interactions within the conventional clamshell binding pocket.
Finally, residues predicted to comprise the distal binding
pocket – i.e., those interacting with the amino acid's R
group side chain – are not conserved within the OlfC
receptor family (Figures 5 and 6). Together with the conservation of proximal pocket residues (including those
comprising the signature motif), these observations suggest that the OlfC receptor family has evolved to detect
and discriminate a diverse spectrum of amino acids and/
or amino acid derivatives. Consistent with this multiplicity of putative amino acid receptors, physiological studies
have provided evidence for multiple, overlapping pathways used by the fish olfactory system to detect this class
of chemical cues [54-56]. Interestingly, behavioral studies

in catfish [57] have shown that fish are able to discriminate between amino acids. The future elucidation of the
ligand specificities of individual, cloned OlfC receptors
should allow an understanding of how this receptor family subserves the physiologic and behavioral discrimination of amino acid-based chemical structures.
Adaptive evolution of OlfC receptors
Our analysis of sequence conservation within the receptor
structure revealed a striking degree of divergence in a considerable portion of the NTD – the region of C family
GPCRs responsible for ligand binding [19,50]. While
sequence conservation is usually a clear indicator of
important function (for example, structural elements necessary for the correct folding of protein domains), lack of
conservation is more difficult to interpret. On the one
hand, the observed variation might represent relaxed
selective pressure consistent with lack of sequence-related
function. For example, some loop regions might only
function to connect secondary structural elements – their
length being important but not their particular sequence.
The observed sequence diversity could therefore be the
result of genetic drift, with polymorphisms in the population being fixed at a rate consistent with the absence of
selective pressure. On the other hand, adaptive evolutionary processes may have driven diversification of protein
function (e.g., to allow the recognition of a different
chemical ligands by recently-duplicated receptors) via
selection on specific residues or protein regions.

We used the relative frequency of non-synonymous vs.
synonymous codon substitutions to assess the selective
processes acting on the OlfC receptor genes [58]. In the
absence of positive or negative selection, the number of
non-synonymous changes relative to the number of possible non-synonymous changes (dN) is equal to the
number of synonymous changes relative to the number of
possible synonymous changes (dS) – i.e., dN/dS = 1. Significant deviations of dN/dS from unity reflect selection
on the sequence; a dN/dS ratio > 1 indicates that a region
has undergone positive selection, whereas a dN/dS ratio <
1 indicates negative or "purifying" selection [58]. For the
present analysis, we aligned a set of 50 full-length intact
zebrafish OlfC coding sequences and calculated dN and
dS values, as previously described [11,58]. We first made
these calculations separately for two broad regions of the
receptor: the NTD and the combined cysteine-rich plus
TM domains (CTD). Both the NTD and CTD appear to be
under negative or purifying selection (dN/dS = 0.216 and
dN/dS = 0.124, respectively). However, the NTD displays
a significantly higher average dN/dS ratio than the CTD (p
= 3.02 × 10-112). These observations are consistent with a
scenario in which there is an overall relaxed negative
selection on the N-terminal sequence, which may have

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/309

permitted OlfC receptors to adapt their binding affinities
to different odorants.
What evolutionary processes may have acted on individual sites within the receptor structure? We hypothesize
that highly conserved sites within the proximal binding
pocket – i.e., those involved in binding the common glycine moiety of all amino acid ligands – might be expected
to have undergone negative or purifying selection. Conversely, sites comprising the distal pocket may have
undergone positive selection as the receptors evolved to
recognize amino acids with different side chains. To test
these ideas, we performed a site-by-site analysis of dN/dS
ratios using the Single Likelihood Ancestor Counting
(SLAC) package [59] (see also [60]), as described previously [11]. A p value derived from a two-tailed extended
binomial distribution was used to assess significance at
each site. Tests on simulated data (S.L.K. Pond and S.D.W.
Frost, methods available in [59]) show that p values less
than or equal to 0.1 identify nearly all true positives with
a false positive rate generally below the nominal p value;
for actual data, the number of true positives at a given
false positive rate is lower.
Figure 7 shows the probability for each codon site being
under positive or negative selection (dN/dS values different than dN/dS = 1.0) on a snake plot of a representative
OlfC amino acid sequence, OlfCa1. By this analysis, only
one site, M436 in OlfCa1, appears to be under positive
selection (dN/dS >1 with p < 0.1). It is unclear what role
this position may play in receptor function. Based on
existing models of C family GPCR structure [49,61], this
site resides within or near the hinge of the ligand-binding
clamshell. The apparent positive selection acting on this
site may therefore indicate its importance in modulating
some aspect of ligand binding or receptor activation. It is
also possible that the identification of this site represents
a false positive from this analysis.
Most sites in the receptor appear to be under negative
selection (dN/dS < 1 with p < 0.1), including all of the
identified proximal binding pocket sites. Interestingly,
many (but not all) of the predicted distal pocket sites
appear to be under relaxed or neutral selection (Figure 7).
These results are also shown overlaid on the structural
model for OlfCa1 ([28]; Figure 6). In this representation,
surface residues predicted to interact with the bound ligand's glycine moiety show clear evidence of negative
selection (dN/dS < 1 with p < 0.1), whereas those lining
the distal pocket show a relaxation of this negative selection (p > 0.1). Together these observations are consistent
with the hypothesis that the proximal pocket sites are
under strong purifying selection, which has maintained
the ability of the OlfC receptors to bind amino acid ligands. The apparent relaxation of negative selection on dis-

tal pocket sites may reflect the adaptation of these
receptors to recognize different amino acids or their derivatives.
Overall, our site-by-site analysis of dN/dS ratios reveals a
striking absence of sites exhibiting signs of positive selection. This may be due to the dominating influence of negative or purifying selection throughout the receptor
coding region. Alternatively, since non-synonymous substitutions are thought to occur only sporadically over evolutionary time, the signatures of less recent substitutions
may no longer be evident. In addition, the power to detect
adaptive evolutionary events at the level of individual
codons decreases in proportion to the time since the event
occurred due to saturation by synonymous substitutions.
Thus, our inability to detect such events may indicate that
they occurred early in the evolution of this gene family.

Conclusion
We describe here a comprehensive analysis of the OlfC
receptor family – the repertoire of C family GPCRs
expressed in the zebrafish olfactory system. Fifty four
intact genes comprise this family, which by phylogenetic
analysis is distinct from other C family GPCRs. A comparison with OlfC receptors identified in fugu suggests that
the 25 present-day subfamilies identified in zebrafish and
fugu probably existed in the most recent common ancestor of the cyprinid and pufferfish lineages. Interestingly,
the major group of fish OlfC receptors is distinct from the
mammalian vomeronasal V2R receptors, suggesting that
these two groups of genes evolved to accommodate different chemosensory cues and/or physiological functions in
the fish and mammalian lineages. Consistent with this
notion, our analysis of sequence conservation and selective pressure indicates that the zebrafish OlfC family
retains a binding pocket signature motif common to all
amino acid receptors characterized to date [32,33]; this
signature motif is similarly conserved in the fugu OlfC
receptors. Thus, the fish OlfC receptors likely evolved to
allow the detection and discrimination of amino acids,
which are potent olfactory cues for teleost fish [29-31]. By
way of contrast, the amino acid-binding signature motif is
not present in the vast majority of V2R receptors, suggesting that the mammalian V2R receptors became specialized to detect chemosensory cues of a chemical
composition different from amino acids. The present
results lay the foundation for future studies aimed at elucidating the ligand specificities and structure-function
relationships of individual OlfC receptors.

set of genes was mapped to the Zv6 assembly. Additional
BLAST searches of Zv6 yielded no additional genes.
Briefly, the data mining protocol we employed is outlined
as follows. Original protein queries for TBLASTN search
(e-value cutoff of 1e-4) of the assemblies included goldfish 5.24 (AAD46570), zebrafish Zo6 (AAN19854), fugu
Ca09 (BAA26124), fugu Ca12 (BAA26125), fugu Ca13
(BAA26126), goldfish GFB1 (AAC64075), and goldfish
GFB8 (AAC64076). Gene prediction on the resulting
sequences was performed using Genewise using a hidden
Markov model (HMM) constructed using HMMER from
the query sequences mentioned above. Protein translations of the predicted genes were aligned with ClustalW.
In order to determine appropriate start and stop codons as
well as correct mis-predicted intron-exon junctions, we
visually inspected the genomic sequence in conjunction
with the alignment of the translations. High quality predictions, defined as unambiguous well-aligned splice
junctions and ungapped genomic sequence, were used in
the next iteration (TBLASTN, HMM construction, Genewise prediction, hand annotation). Final mapping of genes
to the Zv6 assembly was performed using Exonerate 1.0
[62] to align the predicted CDS sequences against the
genome sequence.
Alignment and tree construction
For multiple alignments of OlfC genes, MAFFT [63,64]
was run with the "localpair" option (all pairwise local
alignment information is provided to the objective function) and a maximum of 1000 iterations. Gaps were
inspected manually and edited in XCED. Both MAFFT 5.0
and XCED are available in [65]. The sequence segments
corresponding to the signal peptide (up to the first conserved cysteine residue) and C-terminal tails were
trimmed for all alignments. The neighbor-joining algorithm [66] as implemented by PFAAT [67] (see also [68])
was used to generate unrooted phylogenetic trees from
these alignments using the BLOSUM 50 similarity matrix;
positions with greater than 50% gaps were excluded. One
thousand bootstraps were performed to assess the support
at each tree node. Maximum likelihood analysis was carried out using PHYML [69] (see also [70]) on the same
processed amino acid alignments described above. Bootstrap analysis with 100 replicates was carried out using the
JTT model of amino acid substitution. The consensus tree
including bootstrap support for each node was plotted for
each dataset using either ATV [71] (see also [72]) or
unrooted [73] (see also [74]). Sequence logos were generated using the program WebLogo [75].

Methods
Iterative data mining
Genome-wide searches of the second (Zv2) and third
(Zv3) draft zebrafish genome assemblies [34] were performed several times using the predicted OlfCs from each
previous round to increase our querying power. The final

The additional unpublished fugu C family GPCRs were
identified by performing a BLASTP search of the JGI protein build with each zebrafish OlfC protein sequence
using an E-value threshold of 10-6. After filtering out protein sequences less than 700 amino acids in length, 33
remained. These were then searched against the 6 published full-length protein sequences from fugu in order to
remove redundant sequences. Twenty eight novel
sequences remained and were included along with the six
published sequences in our analyses. Note that the JGI
genes were predicted by the gene prediction programs
Genscan, Fgenesh and Genewise, and have not been subjected to rigorous annotation criteria.
dN/dS analysis
The dN/dS ratios for multi-codon regions (i.e. the transmembrane domain and extracellular domain) of the OlfC
receptor coding sequence were determined using previously published methods [58]. To make inferences about
selective pressure (positive and negative selection) on
individual codons (sites) within the coding sequence of
the zebrafish OlfC genes, the Single Likelihood Ancestor
Counting (SLAC) package [59], which implements the
Suzuki-Gojobori method [60], was used. Fifty out of the
54 intact zebrafish genes (omitting OlfCr1, OlfCq17,
OlfCm1 and OlfCg6) were used for all calculations.
Details regarding both of these methods are provided in
ref. [11].
Tertiary structure prediction
A model of the zebrafish OlfCa1 receptor NTD [28] was
used for structural predictions. Based on this structural
