Driving south: a multi-gene phylogeny of the
brown algal family Fucaceae reveals relationships
and recent drivers of a marine radiation
Fernando G Cánovas*, Catarina F Mota, Ester A Serrão and Gareth A Pearson

Abstract
Background: Understanding the processes driving speciation in marine ecosystems remained a challenge until
recently, due to the unclear nature of dispersal boundaries. However, recent evidence for marine adaptive
radiations and ecological speciation, as well as previously undetected patterns of cryptic speciation is overturning
this view. Here, we use multi-gene phylogenetics to infer the family-level evolutionary history of Fucaceae
(intertidal brown algae of the northern Pacific and Atlantic) in order to investigate recent and unique patterns of
radiative speciation in the genus Fucus in the Atlantic, in contrast with the mainly monospecific extant genera.
Results: We developed a set of markers from 13 protein coding genes based on polymorphic cDNA from EST
libraries, which provided novel resolution allowing estimation of ancestral character states and a detailed
reconstruction of the recent radiative history. Phylogenetic reconstructions yielded similar topologies and revealed
four independent trans-Arctic colonization events by Fucaceae lineages, two of which also involved transitions
from hermaphroditism to dioecy associated with Atlantic invasions. More recently, reversion of dioecious ancestral
lineages towards hermaphroditism has occurred in the genus Fucus, particularly coinciding with colonization of
more extreme habitats. Novel lineages in the genus Fucus were also revealed in association with southern habitats.
These most recent speciation events occurred during the Pleistocene glaciations and coincided with a shift
towards selfing mating systems, generally southward shifts in distribution, and invasion of novel habitats.
Conclusions: Diversification of the family occurred in the Late-Mid Miocene, with at least four independent transArtic lineage crossings coincident with two reproductive mode transitions. The genus Fucus arose in the Pliocene
but radiated within a relatively short time frame about 2.5 million years ago. Current species distributions of Fucus
suggest that climatic factors promoted differentiation between the two major clades, while the recent and rapid
species radiation in the temperate clade during Pleistocene glacial cycles coincided with several potential
speciation drivers.

Background
Most of the world’s biodiversity occurs in the oceans,
but understanding the processes that drive speciation in
marine ecosystems remains a challenge particularly due
to the perceived scarcity of geographical barriers to gene
flow [1]. Although much marine diversity stems from
climate-driven vicariant and colonization events [2,3],
the accumulation of phylogenetic information is revealing that a considerable amount of diversity arises during
adaptive radiations [4,5], these periods of rapid

speciation associated with diversification into multiple
ecological niches (e.g., [6,7]), have also been shown to
occur in marine systems where barriers to dispersal are
not obvious [8].
Ecotypic divergence in response to strong environmental gradients or novel habitats (e.g., [8-11]) is a form
of ecology-driven divergent selection that can cause
population substructuring and differentiation [12].
Reproductive isolation occurs later, favouring assortative
mating and facilitating speciation [13]. Mating system
and reproductive ecology can also play an important
role in marine speciation (e.g., [14]), although they
remain under-studied in this environment. A major

question is whether the evolution of hermaphroditic
selfing entities from outcrossing lineages is a major
trend in the sea, in common with terrestrial plant mating system evolution [15]. The evolutionary shift toward
selfing increases colonization potential and reproductive
assurance, while also serving to maintain local adaptations in stressful environments at the cost of genetic
diversity and evolvability [16].
Geographical events driving speciation by vicariance
or colonization have raised most interest in marine systems, and one of the most significant in the northern
hemisphere was the opening of the Bering Strait. The
formation of a marine connection between the North
Pacific and the Arctic and North Atlantic Oceans
[17,18] allowed trans-oceanic dispersal and divergence
between Pacific and Atlantic sister taxa (e.g., [19]).
Although the Pliocene opening of the Bering Strait has
been placed at ca. 5.5 - 5.4 Ma [18], geomorphological
and biological data [20] indicated that earlier openings
possibly occurred in the Late Miocene. After the Pliocene opening, current patterns initially favoured Atlantic
to Pacific exchanges [17] until ca. 3.5 Ma, after the closure of the Isthmus of Panama. The period of global
cooling leading to the quaternary ice ages (starting ca.
1.8 Ma) began a series of oscillations in sea level and
Arctic Ocean ice coverage, during which the Bering
Strait closed and reopened at least six times [20]. Warmer periods coincided with higher trans-Arctic water
flow, favouring inter-ocean dispersal events [21].
The brown algal family Fucaceae constitutes an important ecosystem-structuring component of cold to temperate intertidal communities in the North Pacific and
North Atlantic Oceans. The wide northern hemisphere
distribution of Fucaceae contrasts with their Australasian
endemic sister families. This is thought to result from a
trans-equatorial crossing with subsequent radiation in
the northern hemisphere, a pattern paralleled in other
families [22]. Ancestors of the Atlantic Fucaceae genera
Ascophyllum, Pelvetia and Fucus, are hypothesized to
have invaded the Atlantic through the Arctic during the
last opening of the Bering Strait [23]. Fucus is the only
Fucaceae genus that radiated extensively in the North
Atlantic [23,24]. The cause of this process remains a
challenging question that is only beginning to be understood [11,25,26]. Most extant genera within Fucaceae are,
in strong contrast with Fucus, species-poor or monospecific. This allowed us to investigate which processes and
events are associated with marine species radiations.
Speciation in Fucus may be associated with habitatspecificity (e.g., [11,25,27]) and variation in mating system and reproductive mode (e.g. [28-31]), with a biogeographic history shaped by glacial cycle-induced range
shifts and secondary contact [26,32-36]. Although the
phylogenetic history of the genus has never been fully

reconstructed despite several attempts, two major clades
were identified previously using nuclear [23] and mitochondrial DNA markers [24]. The first clade is northern,
cold-water and relatively stress-susceptible (lineage 1 in
[24]), and contains F. serratus and F. distichus (sensu
lato [32]). The second clade (lineage 2) has a more
southern extension with generally greater stress-tolerance, and contains F. ceranoides, F. vesiculosus, F. spiralis, F. guiryi, F. virsoides and F. radicans.
Our aim is to provide insight into marine speciation
processes by inferring the phylogeny of the Fucaceae
family. The study is particularly focused on unravelling
the evolutionary history of radiative speciation within the
genus Fucus, particularly the very speciose clade 2 (see
below). In order to do this, we developed phylogenetic
markers and used explicit biogeographic sampling of distinct populations and potentially novel species/entities
suspected in clade 2 [11,25-27]. We also provide a temporal evolutionary hypothesis by calibrating the obtained
phylogenies in geological time using the fossil record
from extinct members of brown algae [37] and information from a dated brown algal multilocus phylogeny [38].
The phylogenetic framework is integrated with paleoreconstructions from the Earth’s climatic history [39-41]
and landmass trends from plate tectonic movements
[42], to provide a hypothesis explaining the major historical events in the evolutionary history of Fucaceae.

Results
Sequences and trees

The dataset for the multi-gene phylogenetic analysis
comprised 4878 aligned bp (1626 amino acids) stored in
13 partitions, each representing a different protein coding region (Additional file 1), based on the cDNA
synthesized from isolated RNA from 84 individuals
representing all genera in the Fucaceae.
The analyses yielded a well-defined phylogenetic
hypothesis for the Fucaceae. Replicate runs of the Bayesian approach (see methods) converged onto similar
posterior distributions after less than 5% of the 106 generations. Phylogenetic reconstructions provided high
confidence except for the branching of taxa F. radicans
and F. gardneri. Relationships among Fucus species,
with the exception of the most recently diverged entity
F. radicans were resolved using this cDNA dataset.
Genomic divergence at protein-coding loci

Analysis of the 13 partial coding sequences provided 395
variable sites, 31 of which were identified as singletons
(see Additional file 2 for accession numbers). Intra-specific nucleotide (nt) variability in the genomic data set
was low, ranging from zero to 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the most diverse species, Pelvetiopsis limitata (Table 1). Intra-specific diversity, measured

as the average number of nucleotide differences between
pairwise sequences across all loci (Table 1), revealed two
significantly more diverse species: P. limitata (14.67)
and Hesperophycus californicus (7.33). All the other species showed average values below 3 nucleotide
differences.
The highest inter-species differentiation was seen
between the genus Fucus and all the other Fucaceae,
ranging from 1.58% to a maximum of 3.05% (0.013 to
0.027 average number of substitutions per site). The
lowest differentiation between genera was that between
H. californicus and P. limitata (0.87% and 0.008 ± 0.002
average number of substitutions per site), which is close
to values found between species of the two major Fucus
clades (less than 0.8% and 0.008 ± 0.002). The heat
shock 90 family protein-coding gene had a 3-codon
insertion in Silvetia compressa that clearly differentiated
this species, despite it displaying low genetic differentiation from a sister genus, here A. nodosum (1.5%).

geographically similar individuals (Figure 1, Bayesian
phylogeny) but they are grouped in a single clade in the
Bayesian inferences based on the coalescent and Yule
speciation models (Figure 2 and Additional file 4). The
recently derived species F. radicans was not resolved
and grouped with sympatric northern F. vesiculosus. All
of these dioecious species/entities were basal to the
clade containing the three hermaphroditic species, the
Mediterranean endemic F. virsoides branching first, followed by the clade containing F. spiralis and the
recently described southern species F. guiryi [11], that
was clearly differentiated from F. spiralis with high node
values for both algorithms. Phylogenetic trees in Figure
1 were built after excluding F. guiryi individuals from
the introgressed contact range (see discussion). The
resulting trees including those individuals (shown in
Additional file 5) show the effects of introgressed individuals in confounding the inference of vertical lineage
splitting [11].

Multi-gene phylogeny of the family Fucaceae

Evolutionary rates and molecular dating

Both maximum likelihood and Bayesian-based reconstruction algorithms yielded similar topologies (Figure
1), differing mostly in the branch lengths and support
values. All current species were resolved except the
recent Baltic species F. radicans, and all nodes that split
different species showed high support for both algorithms. Phylogenies built using cDNA nucleotide
sequences therefore resulted in much improved resolution over previously used markers, despite lower genetic
distances than earlier described with ITS. Re-analysis of
ITS data [23] confidently inferred the Ascophyllum - Silvetia clade to root the remaining divergence events in
the Fucaceae using the 13 cDNA loci.
The 13 protein-coding genes identified the same two
major clades within Fucus as ITS ([23] and reanalyzed
data in Additional file 3) and mitochondrial DNA [24].
In Fucus clade 1, two subclades were again recovered.
Dioecious F. serratus and the hermaphroditic group corresponding to F. distichus sensu lato, in which our sampling of the geographic extremes revealed low intraspecific divergence.
In contrast with the polytomy found previously
[23,24], species relationships within clade 2 were
resolved (Figure 1), with the exception of F. radicans
(see below). The earliest diverging lineage leads to the
estuarine species F. ceranoides. This is followed by the
discovery that F. vesiculosus is not monophyletic, but is
split according to geographical location of the samples
into a northern (splitting earlier from the remaining
species; Figure 1, ML phylogeny), and a southern clade.
The latter shares a common ancestor with the hermaphroditic species in this lineage. The southern F. vesiculosus samples appear to form two distinct clades of

Bayesian MCMC inference resulted in an estimate of the
mean evolutionary rate across Fucaceae of 0.0016 substitutions per thousand years (95% confidence interval 0.0008
to 0.0025). We emphasize that, taking into account the
confidence intervals, the evolutionary rates for the separate
coding genes largely overlapped and the coefficient of variation across the tree was 0.6. The nucleotide substitutions
per site range from values close to zero for comparisons
within Fucus spp. up to 0.029 ± 0.005 for the whole family
(S. compressa and F. gardneri; Table 1).
Coalescent theory and the Yule speciation model were
used to evaluate the history of Fucaceae (Figure 2).
Trees agree well with Bayesian and ML phylogenetic
reconstructions (Figure 1). Both demographic models
broadly coincided when used to infer dates for the
nodes placed near the origin of all Fucaceae genera, but
differed considerably in dating recent speciation events,
particularly within Fucus. The time intervals reported
are maximally conservative and correspond to the range
for both demographic models together. Our molecular
dating leads to an estimate for the origin of the diversification of Fucaceae around 19.5-7.0 million years ago
(Ma) (Figure 2 and Additional file 6). The origin of the
lineage leading to Pelvetia canaliculata, eventually
resulting in an Atlantic invasion, was dated at 16.4 to
5.4 Ma. Divergence between the lineages leading to
Ascophyllum nodosum and to the genus Silvetia (11.7 to
1 Ma) was coincident in time with the split of the lineage leading to H. californicus and P. limitata from the
Fucus genus lineage (12.2 to 2.7 Ma). Both of these
splits correspond to a Pacific-Atlantic crossing by members of the lineages now represented by the genera Ascophyllum and Fucus in the Atlantic. The diversification of

Tests of mating system evolutionary hypotheses

The best fitting model for the different diversification
hypotheses related to the evolution of mating systems
(see Table 2 and estimation of ancestral character states
and diversification in the Methods section) was the oneparameter Markov k-state model (MK1; AIC = 104.522).
This model indicates that speciation (l) and extinction
(μ) rates were state-independent ldioecious = lhermaphroditic
= 0.24; μ dioecious = l hermaphroditic = 0.14) and that the
transition between character states was also bidirectional

and state-independent (q01 = q10 = 0.56). Ancestral
state reconstruction from the scaled likelihood of every
state of the character (Figure 3) resulted in poor resolution of deeper nodes, showing equal likelihood for either
character state (dioecious vs. hermaphroditic). The node
describing the state of the mrca of all Fucus species
showed higher scaled likelihood for the state of dioecy
(logLikscaled = 0.63), as well as the other nodes involved
in the evolution of the genus (logLikscaled ranged from
0.54 to 0.84). However the two more recent ancestors of
F. virsoides, F. spiralis and F. guiryi were estimated to
have been hermaphroditic (logLikscaled = 0.92 and 0.99,
respectively). The common ancestor of Hesperophycus
and Pelvetiopsis was also estimated as having been hermaphroditic (logLikscaled = 0.62).

Tests of geographic hypotheses related to the Bering
Strait oceanic boundary

The testing of hypotheses related to geographic (i.e.,
Pacific vs. Atlantic/Arctic) origin and diversification (see
Table 3 and estimation of ancestral character states and
diversification from the Methods section) showed the
GeoSSE model as having the best fit (AIC = 107.66, loglikelihood = -46.83). The model indicates that diversification rates were state-dependent (sPacific = 0.195; sAtlantic = 0.019; xPacific = 0.049; xAtlantic = 0.000), and that the
dispersal rates between the two geographic regions
(both sides of the Bering Strait) were almost unidirectional from the Pacific (dPacific to Atlantic = 0.075). The
DEC model also reported low dispersal (0.032) and
extinction (0.000) rates (log.likelihood = -13.25). Ancestral state reconstruction was also performed for the
sink-sink GeoSSE model (second best model like MK2)
and DEC models (Figure 4a and 4b, respectively). Deeper nodes were poorly resolved by the sink-sink model,
showing similar scaled likelihoods for either character
state (Pacific vs. Atlantic; Figure 4a), but DEC provided
better estimates for the alternative scenarios (branches
in Figure 4b). Estimates of the geographic origin of the
family were similar for Pacific and Atlantic Oceans
using the GeoSSE model (logLikscaled = 0.42 and 0.58,
respectively), while the DEC model placed the origin in
the Pacific (logLikscaled = 0.47) or in both biogeographic
areas across the Bering Strait (logLikscaled = 0.32; pie on
nodes in Figure 4b). This last observation agrees with
the rate of between-region mode of speciation obtained
by the GeoSSE model (sPacific-Atlantic = 1.225) that was
higher than within-region speciation rates. Alternatively,
these results also agree with hypothetical divergence
along the boundary between both regions in the Arctic
Ocean. The most recent common ancestor to Fucus was
estimated as Atlantic (logLikscaled = 0.86 and 0.63 for
both GeoSSE and DEC models, respectively). Finally,

both models predicted an Atlantic ancestor of F. serratus and F. distichus (clade 1; logLikscaled = 0.70 for the
nodes and 0.53 for the inheritance scenario).

Discussion
A multi-gene phylogenetic approach resulted in a much
finer resolution of relationships at the tips of the tree
compared with previous phylogenies. This framework
allowed the estimation of dates of divergence and patterns of speciation across the family and within the
recently radiated genus Fucus.
Dating inter-ocean divergence events in Fucaceae

The models used returned similar dated intervals on
deeper nodes corresponding to the splitting events of
ancestral Fucaceae lineages, but were less congruent in
dating recent speciation events. This is likely due to the
constraints of the priors used [43,44]. Although we
remain conservative by reporting the range for both
models, the narrower and more recent coalescent-based
intervals at the tips of the tree are more in agreement
with the biological processes associated with speciation
in these taxa [45].
The most likely origin of the Fucaceae is in the Pacific
Ocean during the mid to late Miocene (19.5-7.0 Ma,
estimated based on 23-7 Ma from [37] and 19.4-8.0 Ma
from ITS; see Additional file 6), when an ancestor of the
Fucaceae might have been able to colonize the North
Pacific, splitting from the Australasian sister lineages
Xiphophoraceae and Hormosiraceae [23,38]. Despite
support for both alternative hypotheses for the Fucaceae
geographic origin, a Pacific origin involves a more direct
route from the southern (Australasia) to the northern
Pacific (and is supported by diversification rates and the
DEC model), whereas the alternative hypothesis of an
Atlantic origin requires a more complex dispersal path.
A Pacific origin is also consistent with the northward

drift of the Australasian landmass towards Eurasia in the
Miocene and a gradual decrease in global temperatures
(14-12 Ma, see Figure 2; [40]), which would have
favored crossing of the equatorial fringe. The origin of
the Fucaceae would then be due to subsequent divergence in the North Pacific.
Our data indicate that four independent Fucaceae
lineages crossed the Bering Strait. The first crossing,
estimated at 16.4-5.4 Ma (Figure 2), involved the splitting of the Atlantic lineage leading to Pelvetia canaliculata, and could only have taken place during the earliest
openings of the Bering Strait suggested for the Late
Miocene (13.0-11.0 and 7.3-6.6 Ma; [20]). Pacific diatoms found in Atlantic marine sediments indicate the
existence of a strait at that time [20], supporting such
early Pacific-Atlantic colonizations. The alternatives to
this scenario, other than methodological bias in dating,
require either accelerated lineage divergence following

Page 8 of 15

the trans-Arctic crossing, or the start of divergence
before the trans-Arctic crossing. The latter is unlikely
because Pelvetia is currently monotypic with no extant
Pacific representatives. While the extreme upper intertidal distribution and stress tolerance of Atlantic P. canaliculata, makes accelerated selective ecological
divergence a plausible explanation, it is unnecessary to
invoke it if earlier openings of the Bering Strait occurred
[20]. A second (and probably later; 11.5-1.1 Ma, Figure
2) trans-Arctic crossing led to the Atlantic genus Ascophyllum, following a split from its Pacific sister genus
Silvetia, coincident with the Bering Strait opening at
5.5-5.4 Ma [18]. These results contradict the previous
ITS phylogeny of [23] but agree with these data after
their re-analysis with better fit models (see methods). It
revealed Ascophyllum as sister to the Pacific genus Silvetia and placed the Ascophyllum-Silvetia in a basal clade
to the Fucaceae, a hypothesis also raised by [23].
The third (possibly simultaneous) trans-Arctic crossing, and the most successful in terms of subsequent speciation, was the split between the current
Hesperophycus-Pelvetiopsis in the Pacific and the lineage
leading to Fucus, of which all current species are Atlantic except the circum-Arctic F. distichus complex. This
divergence, estimated at 12.2-2.7 Ma, coincides both in
time and reproductive mode (shifting from hermaphroditic to dioecious) with the Ascophyllum lineage split
from the Silvetia clade. The timing of both lineage splitting events leading to Ascophyllum and Fucus centers
around the opening of the Bering Strait 5.5-5.4 Ma
when, despite moving against the predominant AtlanticPacific flow, the warmer climate (see Figure 2) might
have facilitated stepping stone colonization and migration across the Arctic. Ancestral state reconstructions
(Figure 4) place the most recent common ancestor of
Fucus in the Atlantic/Arctic ocean basin, suggesting that
it was here that subsequent diversification took place.
The alternative hypothesis, deserving further study, is
that the opening of the Bering Strait led to a vicariant
split between clade 1 in the Pacific and clade 2 in the
Atlantic. An additional interesting question remains as
to why, following similar colonization conditions by ecologically similar lineages, Ascophyllum is currently a
monotypic genus whereas Fucus underwent relatively
extensive speciation.
The fourth trans-Arctic crossing involved the evolutionary history of Arctic vicariance in Fucus clade 1.
The ancestor to clade 1 was estimated as Atlantic (Figure 4), and the Atlantic-Pacific dichotomy might be
more accurately described as Arctic to agree with the
geographical and ecological range of current representatives. The ancestral state reconstruction implies that F.
serratus/F. distichus diverged in the Atlantic and/or
within the Arctic basin, which represent the same side

(previously named F. evanescens) and Pacific (previously
named F. gardneri) samples of F. distichus used in this
phylogeny correspond to the geographical extremes of
the ranges found within the F. distichus complex
[24,46], estimated Pacific-Atlantic divergence times
based on coalescence are very recent (mid-Pleistocene)
(Figure 2). Thus our data do not contradict the current

designation of these lineages as a single species, F. distichus (see [32]), but do not rule out low levels of vicariant divergence (Figure 1), also in agreement with Coyer
et al. [32].

temperate distribution of F. ceranoides from Norway to
North Portugal is similar to the present day range of F.
serratus in clade 1 [33], which has a coincident speciation time (Figure 2). Nuclear and organelle phylogenies
for F. ceranoides are congruent in the southern part of
the range, while to the north of the English Channel
populations harbour exclusively introgressed organellar
genomes captured from F. vesiculosus that have spread
by genetic surfing during postglacial range expansion
[36]. This is not the only case of organellar introgression
in this clade [26], emphasizing that organellar sequences
can be equivocal for phylogenetic inferences in taxa
prone to introgression. F. vesiculosus was shown here to
be polyphyletic. Two clades were well separated within
F. vesiculosus according to their range distributions
from: i) Iberia to the south versus, ii) the English Channel to the north. These are also differentiated at microsatellite loci [25,29,47], both in allelic frequencies and in
the presence of private alleles, but were not recovered
previously with mitochondrial markers [24,26], possibly
due to masking by extensive organellar introgressionexpansion dynamics that can take place in Fucus species
[36]. Importantly, the southern F. vesiculosus share a
common ancestor with the remaining members of the
same lineage, all of which are hermaphroditic. The two
divergent lineages in what is currently named F. vesiculosus coincide in present distribution with two marine
glacial refugia (Iberia and Brittany; [3]). A split of southern F. vesiculosus into two clades suggested by certain
analyses (Figure 1 and Additional file 4 and 5) deserves
further investigation, but could result from introgressive
signatures with F. guiryi, which may be found in sympatry in some regions [11,25,47], but not in the southernmost sites where the two species are allopatric [11,30]
(Figure 1 and Additional file 5).
Divergence of the hermaphroditic lineage in clade 2
(leading to F. virsoides, F. spiralis and F. guiryi) from
their dioecious sister lineage may have been driven or at
least maintained by reproductive isolation derived from
a selfing reproductive mode. Once a hermaphroditic
lineage arises, selfing may follow rapidly, reinforcing
genetic isolation and favouring subsequent differentiation [48]. Selfing can be advantageous in marginal and/
or stressful habitats to conserve local adaptation and for
reproductive assurance, both key selective pressures for
intertidal broadcast spawners such as Fucus [49].
The earliest divergence within the hermaphroditic clade
is F. virsoides, currently restricted to the northern Adriatic
Sea, a possible remnant from a more extensive distribution
during a cooler glacial period. More recently, the lineage
split between F. guiryi and F. spiralis coincides with southern vs. northern ranges. Along the southern range, Fucus
species are segregated by habitat, i.e., open coast (F. guiryi)
versus estuaries and coastal lagoons (southern F.

Page 10 of 15

vesiculosus), whereas further north, where they co-occur,
F. guiryi undergoes introgression [11,25,26,47], which was
hypothesized to reflect the absence of reinforcement during allopatric evolution [47]. The phylogenetic position of
the high intertidal F. spiralis reported here is incongruent
with mitochondrial data [26], possibly another case of
extensive organellar introgression in this genus.
Our data, like previous ITS and mitochondrial data
[23,24], do not resolve the relationship between the
recently described F. radicans and F. vesiculosus. This is
unsurprising given the suggested timescale of divergence
(hundreds to at most thousands of years [27]), since the
opening of the Baltic Sea (ca. 7 Kya), possibly facilitated
by high adaptive potential of the common ancestor with
F. vesiculosus [10,50].
Mating system evolution

The evolution of reproductive mode in the Fucaceae has
followed a reticulate pattern of alternating dioecious and
hermaphroditic lineages that challenges current understanding of mating system evolutionary trends (Figure 3;
e.g., [15,16]). Methods to estimate the influence of species’ traits on lineage diversification establish hermaphroditic lineages as ancestral in the family, evolving into
dioecious lineages, folowed by switches from dioecy to
hermaphroditism in the genus Fucus, contradicting earlier suggestions [24,51]. There is considerable support
for hermaphroditism (cosexuality) as the ancestral state
in plants [15], and simple genetic mechanisms of dioecious sex determination and sex chromosome evolution
have been proposed (reviewed by [52,53]). It is intriguing that two of the three novel Atlantic lineages presumably coincided with a switch to dioecy (Ascophyllum
and Fucus). The evolution of dioecy and increased evolutionary potential [16] may therefore have facilitated
long-term establishment in the Atlantic, driven in part
by the availability of extensive and novel habitats favouring large and dense populations. In contrast, hermaphroditic lineages are better colonizers of marginal
habitats via increased reproductive assurance and the
maintenance of locally adaptive traits.
The recent evolutionary trajectory of reproductive
mode has been a switch towards hermaphroditism, and
highly selfing mating systems, at least within Fucus lineage 2 [29,30]. The transition from outcrossing to selfing
is common in plants [54], but with little evidence for
reversion, suggesting an evolutionary dead-end [16,55].
This in turn suggests that the hermaphroditic ancestors
of the dioecious lineages leading to Ascophyllum and
Fucus were not highly selfing.

Conclusions
The analysis of concatenated cDNA sequences from 13
partial coding regions resolved the evolutionary history of

Cánovas et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:371

the Fucaceae, and allowed the dating of splitting events
and tests of hypotheses concerning recent drivers of speciation. Diversification of the family could be placed in the
Late-Mid Miocene. Four independent trans-Arctic colonisations were inferred, coincident with the split of the
lineages leading to 1) Pelvetia canaliculata, 2) Ascophyllum nodosum, 3) the genus Fucus, and more recently 4) in
the F. distichus species complex. Two dioecious lineages
(originating the genera Ascophyllum and Fucus) evolved in
the Atlantic/Arctic from hermaphroditic ancestors.
Despite an earlier origin of the genus Fucus, most current
species have evolved within a relatively short time frame
starting 4-3 Ma in the Pleistocene. Both Fucus clades contain dioecious and hermaphroditic lineages, and recent
speciation trends in clade 2 have given rise to hermaphroditic lineages from dioecious ancestors. Recent radiation in
Fucus clade 2 coincides with divergence in physiological
tolerance to environmental stresses and colonization of
novel habitats at range edges, suggesting ecological speciation. In this clade, selfing lineages occur in the most
extreme habitats, likely linked with reproductive assurance
and the maintenance of local adaptation.

occurring exclusively in the Atlantic. All species of
Fucus occur in the Atlantic and its adjacent seas except
F. distichus (sensu lato), which is also found in the Pacific. At least 3 individuals from each of the 6 genera of
Fucaceae were used in all analyses except for Ascophyllum and Pelvetia (2 individuals; Additional file 2).
Samples were collected from several locations from
where it was possible to transport specimens alive or
deep frozen in dry ice to prevent RNA degradation: 1
Pacific, 7 North Atlantic, 1 Baltic and 1 Mediterranean
regions were used (Additional file 2). Sequences from a
previous study [11] were also added (shown in Additional file 2). Fresh material was lyophilized and samples
were stored at room temperature with silica drying crystals prior to RNA extraction [56].

The specificity of the cDNA primer sequences was too
great to allow amplification of gene products outside the
family Fucaceae, specifically for the sister families
Xiphophoraceae and Hormosiraceae [23,38,59]. In order
to include in the multi-gene phylogenetic estimations
the sister families outside the Fucaceae, we used additional ITS sequence information from a previous study
[23], but applyed more advanced methodological analyses. Those sequences were first re-aligned using
MAFFT v6 [60], using the E-INS-i option recommended
for sequences with multiple conserved domains and
long gaps [61]. K80 plus I plus G was selected as the
best model fit to the nucleotide data set based on AIC
as implemented in MrModeltest [62]. ITS dataset was
analysed using maximum likelihood and Bayesian
approaches as described above (see multi-gene phylogenetic analyses section). This rooted phylogenetic resolution of the genera in the Fucaceae based on ITS
sequences was used to infer the basal genera of the
family Fucaceae. These genera, Ascophyllum and Silvetia
were used as outgroup to root the multi-gene phylogenetic analyses aimed at inferring the order of the previously unresolved speciation events.

RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and amplification

Multi-gene phylogenetic analyses

Lyophilized tissue was powdered for 5 min on a Mixer
Mill (MM 300 - Retsch, Germany) and total RNA was
isolated using the extraction method as described in
Pearson et al. [56]. RNA integrity was confirmed by
electrophoresis on 1.2% denaturing agarose gels. For
reverse transcription, a solution of 1 μg total RNA, 1
mM dNTPs and 5 μM oligo d(T) was denatured at 70°C
for 5 min and placed on ice for > 1 min. First Strand
Buffer, DTT (0.1 M), RNase OUT and SuperScript™

The cDNA sequence dataset (Additional file 2) was
aligned first using MAFFT v6 [60], using the G-INS-i
option recommended for sequences with global homology [61]. Models of sequence evolution were selected
based on Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) as implemented in MrModeltest v2.3 [62] for each of the 13 partitions defined by each gene: Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano
model (HKY; [63]) was most appropriate for the 1st,
11th and 12th partitions, HKY plus I for 5th, 6th, 7th

and 10th partitions and HKY plus G for 13th partition;
Kimura 2-parameter (K80; [64]) for 8th and 9th partitions, plus I for 2nd partition; Symmetrical model plus
G (SYM; [65]) for 3rd partition; and General Time
Reversible (GTR; [66]) plus I for 4th partition. The combined data set was analyzed as one partition using the
GTR model plus I and G.
Maximum likelihood bootstrap analysis with 999 replicates was performed to infer the phylogenetic relationships for the combined data set using PhyML v3.0.1
[67]. The substitution parameters were estimated over a
neighbor-joining tree. Tree searching operations were
set to best of nearest-neighbour interchange (NNI) with
subtree pruning and regrafting (SPR). Partitioned Bremer support analysis [68] was performed using TreeRot
v2 [69,70], in order to provide a measure of how the different partitions of the data contributed to the Decay
index for each node in the context of the combined
data analysis.
Bayesian inferences were performed with MrBayes
v3.1.2 [71]. For the partitioned analysis, the substitution
model and branch length estimates were allowed to vary
independently in each partition. General forms of these
models were used since there is a specific recommendation against the use of fixed priors for a and I in the
software manual in order to explore more efficiently different values of these parameters. The number of generations was set to 10 6 with a sampling frequency of
1000 generations in a dual running process with four
chains per run [72]. Majority rule consensus trees were
computed after discarding the first 25% of the trees as
burn-in, which were saved prior to MCMC convergence.
Support for clades given by posterior probabilities was
thus represented by the majority rule percentage.
Evolutionary divergence time estimations

Two major problems preclude a well-defined fossil
record for the brown algae: a) almost all brown algae
are uncalcified; b) misidentification due to the morphological similarities with some members of the Rhodophyta [37]. Brown algae are known, however, from
Miocene rocks in California and diatomaceous sediments in Central Europe [73,74]. Some of these can be
directly compared to genera of the extant family Sargassaceae, as Cystoseirites (similar to Cystoseira) or Paleohalidrys (which has modern representatives) that are in
the order Fucales, and provide a valuable framework for
evolutionary parameter estimation and molecular dating
of Fucaceae [37].
Likelihood ratio tests significantly rejected a strict
(uniform) molecular clock for the alignment. Node age
estimates were therefore obtained by Bayesian-calibrated
phylogenies using an uncorrelated log-normal relaxed
clock as suggested for protein-coding genes in a broad

Page 12 of 15

variety of species [75]. Gene-specific gamma-distributed
rate heterogeneity among sites and partition into codon
position allowed separate estimation of non-synonymous
and synonymous sites [76]. The HKY model of evolution was defined as proposed by Shapiro et al. [77] for
coding regions. Tree priors were fixed on the coalescent,
using constant population size and expansion growth,
and on Yule speciation models of demographic history.
Monophyletic constraints were imposed for the nodes
that were used to calibrate the evolutionary rates. Uniform priors were used for the tmrca of the Fucaceae
family (Aquitanium to Tortonian age from Miocene
epoch: minimum age of 7 Myr; maximum age of 23
Myr; based on [38] and previous analyses using 5.8S
ribosomal nuclear DNA together with ITS-1 and ITS-2
regions; see Additional file 6). Tree priors were used for
the tmrca of the Fucus genus. MCMC chains were run
in BEAST v1.5.4 for 107 generations, with burn-in and
sampling as described above [78]. Identical sequences or
those with genetic distances less than 0.002 were
removed prior to the analyses in order to prevent nodes
without longitude on the dated reconstruction. Convergence and stationarity of the chains was evaluated by
plotting trace files in Tracer v. 1.4 [78]. Phylogenetic
trees were represented using R statistical software
v2.13.0 [79] together with “ape v2.5-1” library [80].
Estimation of ancestral character states and traits
associated with lineage diversification

Methods to estimate the influence of species’ traits on
lineage diversification have improved with recent
advances in the detection of phylogenetic signatures of
state-dependent speciation and extinction [81]. In particular, hypotheses of trait acquisition for a binary character and asymmetry in the direction of trait evolution can
now be tested through the formulation of a model [81].
For example, mating system is likely to confer unequal
probabilities of speciation and extinction. Two states of
the character were used for mating system evolution
(dioecious vs. hermaphroditic), under one-parameter
(MK1) and asymmetrical 2-parameter (MK2) Markov kstate models [82-84]. The binary state speciation and
extinction model (BiSSE, [84]) was also used to avoid
incorrect rejection of irreversible evolution [81].
Alternative hypotheses concerning geographic range
evolution and diversification (Pacific vs. Atlantic), were
also tested using a geographic state speciation and
extinction model (GeoSSE; [85]). We applied the model
to test the relative contributions of speciation, extinction, and dispersal to diversity differences between
oceans [85]. We also considered different combinations
of state-independent and state-dependent diversification,
and dispersal (Table 2).

Cánovas et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:371
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/371

BiSSE and GeoSSE model assumptions were satisfied
through the use of the best rooted tree based on the
dated ITS and multi-gene phylogenies: i) rooted phylogenetic tree with branch lengths; ii) contemporaneous
terminal taxa and; iii) ultrametric tree [81]. Characters
were binary with known state for each of the terminal
taxa. Models were fitted by maximum likelihood nonlinear optimization from a heuristic starting point based
on the character-independent birth-death model. Model
results were evaluated and compared using the logarithm of the likelihood and the AIC values for the final
fitted models. Ancestral character states and the associated uncertainty were also estimated from the scaled
likelihood of each character state. Analyses were carried
out using the R statistical software [79], with “diversitree
v0.7-2” and “ape v2.5-1” packages [80,85-87].
The dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis (DEC) likelihood
model was also implemented to infer geographic ancestry and estimate rates of dispersal and local extinction
[88,89]. Unconstrained and stratified biogeographical
models were considered. The latter model stratified the
phylogeny into different time slices, reflecting the Bering
Strait configuration over time while considering divisions that retained enough phylogenetic events [90].
Five time slices were chosen that reflect the hypothesized openings of the Bering Strait during the history of
Fucaceae: between 13 and 11 Ma, between 7.3 and 6.6
Ma, between 5.5 Ma and 4.0, between 3.6 Ma and 3.2,
and between 2.5 and the present day (see Figure 2 for a
detailed time-placement of the recurrent opening events
[18,20]). For each time slice, we defined a Q matrix in
which transition rates were made dependent on the geographical connectivity between areas (i.e. opening and
closing of the Bering Strait). Lagrange analyses were configured using the web application from the same authors
(URL: http://www.reelab.net/lagrange/configurator;
[88,89]) and run locally using Lagrange v.20110117 [89].
Results were summarized and plotted using the R statistical software [79] with the “ape v2.5-1” package [80].

(above) and the 50% majority rule consensus tree of maximum likelihood
bootstraps (below). H. banskii was used as outgroup to root the
phylogenetic reconstructions (as in [23]). These results were also used to
root the multi-gene phylogenetic trees since the specificity of primers
used to amplify transcriptomic regions in the Fucaceae did not allow
amplification outside this group. Topology is based on maximum

described for Figure 1. Comparison of this tree with Figure 1 illustrates
the effect of introgressed contact regions in preventing phylogenetic

using an uncorrelated log-normal relaxed clock under GTR model of
evolution. Tree priors were fixed on Yule speciation model of
demographic history. One individual of Cystoseira neglecta, C.
osmundacea and C. setchellii species were included as representatives of
the family Sargassaceae for the inferences ([94]; accession numbers:

imposed for the nodes that were used to calibrate the evolutionary rates.

ancestor (tmrca) of Fucaceae and Sargassaceae families (Medium
Chattium to Aquitanium age from Miocene epoch: mean 22.5 million
years (Myr); standard deviation 2.5 Myr [37]). Results were processed as
