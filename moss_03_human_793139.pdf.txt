Abstract
Background: Stargazin (γ2) and the closely related γ3, and γ4 transmembrane proteins are part of
a family of proteins that may act as both neuronal voltage-dependent calcium channel (VDCC) γ
subunits and transmembrane α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproponinc (AMPA)
receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs). In this investigation, we examined the distribution patterns
of the stargazin-like proteins γ2, γ3, and γ4 in the human central nervous system (CNS). In addition,
we investigated whether human γ2 or γ4 could modulate the electrophysiological properties of a
neuronal VDCC complex transiently expressed in Xenopus oocytes.
Results: The mRNA encoding human γ2 is highly expressed in cerebellum, cerebral cortex,
hippocampus and thalamus, whereas γ3 is abundant in cerebral cortex and amygdala and γ4 in the
basal ganglia. Immunohistochemical analysis of the cerebellum determined that both γ2 and γ4 are
present in the molecular layer, particularly in Purkinje cell bodies and dendrites, but have an inverse
expression pattern to one another in the dentate cerebellar nucleus. They are also detected in the
interneurons of the granule cell layer though only γ2 is clearly detected in granule cells. The
hippocampus stains for γ2 and γ4 throughout the layers of the every CA region and the dentate
gyrus, whilst γ3 appears to be localized particularly to the pyramidal and granule cell bodies. When
co-expressed in Xenopus oocytes with a CaV2.1/β4 VDCC complex, either in the absence or
presence of an α2δ2 subunit, neither γ2 nor γ4 significantly modulated the VDCC peak current
amplitude, voltage-dependence of activation or voltage-dependence of steady-state inactivation.
Conclusion: The human γ2, γ3 and γ4 stargazin-like proteins are detected only in the CNS and
display differential distributions among brain regions and several cell types in found in the
cerebellum and hippocampus. These distribution patterns closely resemble those reported by
other laboratories for the rodent orthologues of each protein. Whilst the fact that neither γ2 nor
γ4 modulated the properties of a VDCC complex with which they could associate in vivo in Purkinje
cells adds weight to the hypothesis that the principal role of these proteins is not as auxiliary
subunits of VDCCs, it does not exclude the possibility that they play another role in VDCC
function.

Background
The mutation underlying the absence epilepsy phenotype
of the allelic stargazer (stg) and waggler (wag) mutant
mice occurs in a gene, cacng2, whose product, stargazin,
has been hypothesized to be a neuronal voltage dependent calcium channel (VDCC) γ subunit [1]. VDCCs are
intrinsically involved in the regulation of a multiplicity of
Ca2+ dependent processes in many different cell types
where they are inserted into the plasma membrane as hetero-oligomeric complexes of a pore-forming α1 subunit
with auxiliary β, α2δ and possibly γ subunits [2].
The first VDCC γ subunit to be identified (γ1) [3–5] was
found to be solely expressed in skeletal muscle, where its
function is to limit calcium entry through the L-type
VDCCs of skeletal myotubes [6,7]. VDCCs purified from
neuronal tissues did not appear to possess a γ subunit [8–
11]. However, despite sharing only weak protein sequence
identity with γ1 (25%), stargazin (γ2) was suggested to represent the first example of a neuronal VDCC γ subunit
based on its similar tetra-spanning transmembrane structure to the γ1 subunit and its ability to weakly modulate
VDCC-current properties in vitro [1]. Subsequent investigations have identified six other stargazin-like genes
which are currently classified as cacng3-cacng8 (encoding
proteins γ3 - γ8), in a continuation of the VDCC γ subunit
nomenclature [12–17].
Investigation of the functional influence of these stargazin-like γ proteins upon VDCCs has yielded mixed
results. Some laboratories have reported that γ2 and its
close homologue γ4 cause small hyperpolarizing shifts in
the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation
[1,14,18]. This however, might be dependent upon which
other auxiliary subunits are co-expressed in the VDCC
complex under investigation [18]. In contrast, Chen et al.
[19] showed whole cell VDCC currents from the cerebellar
granule cells of stg mice, which effectively lack the γ2 subunit, do not have significantly altered voltage-dependence
of activation or inactivation compared to wild type. Other
laboratories reported that γ2 or γ3 can significantly reduce
peak current amplitudes of N-type VDCCs expressed in
Xenopus oocytes, but only when co-expressed with an α2δ1
subunit [20], and supporting this, that thalamic relay neurons from stg mice express enhanced low and high voltage-activated VDCC currents compared to wild type [21].
Furthermore, clear biochemical evidence has been generated for a direct interaction of γ2 with the VDCC CaV2.2 α1
subunit [20,22]. Another stargazin-like protein, γ7, which
is phylogenetically distinct from γ2, γ3 and γ4 [13,15],
almost abolishes the expression of CaV2.2 when coexpressed in vitro, and also reduces Ca2+ currents via
CaV1.2 and CaV2.1 channels [15]. However, our data indicated that the influence of γ7 on VDCC function is to
reduce α1 subunit protein expression, a functional prop-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/4/23

erty unlike anything reported for the other stargazin-like
proteins, which suggests that γ7 is not a subunit of a calcium channel complex [15].
Whilst controversy surrounds the role of the γ2, γ3 and γ4
stargazin-like proteins in relation to VDCC modulation, a
clear function has been determined for these proteins as
chaperones for the appropriate trafficking and receptor
biogenesis of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptors [19,23–25]. Consequently, these three proteins together with their close
homologue γ8, were recently dubbed transmembrane
AMPA receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs) [25]. A primary interaction (probably via transmembrane and/or
extracellular regions [26]) promotes the trafficking of the
GluR subunits to the plasma membrane, and a secondary
interaction of the C-terminus of stargazin with PSD-95 or
a similar cytoskeletal protein via a PSD-95/DLG/ZO1(PDZ)-binding motif facilitates the lateral relocation of
the glutamate receptor complex to its correct position in
the post-synaptic density [19] and hence influences the
number of AMPA receptors located at this site [27].
Elucidation of the differential distribution of the stargazin-like proteins coupled with studies of the physiological abnormalities underlying the epilepsy phenotypes of
the mice expressing what are effectively null mutations of
γ2 has also helped to determine some of the normal functions of these proteins in the murine CNS. The stg and wag
mice display a loss of the fast component of EPSC at
mossy fiber to cerebellar granule cell synapses [28,29],
plus reduced synaptic transmission at parallel fiber
Purkinje cell synapses in wag [29]. However, the synaptic
transmission to CA1 pyramidal cells (Schaffer collateral
projection) in stg is not altered [28]. In situ hybridization
studies have determined that murine γ2 is normally
expressed at its highest levels in the cerebellum [1,14,19].
γ3 and γ4 mRNAs are also detected in mouse cerebellum
but γ3 mRNA has been detected only in the Golgi neurons
of the granule cell layer and is absent from the molecular
layer [19]. γ4 mRNA is localized to the Purkinje, rather
than the granule cell layer [14]. Whilst this manuscript
was in preparation, Tomita et al. [25] reported that γ2 is
the only TARP expressed in rat cerebellar granule cells, but
like mouse, all isoforms are detected in hippocampus
[1,14,19,25]. The genetic defect in stg results in the loss of
γ2 mRNA and protein and does not appear to result in upor down-regulated expression of γ3 or γ4 [1,22]. Collectively, these data suggest that stg mice exhibit the loss of
fast synaptic transmission in the mossy fiber to granule
cell synapse because γ2 is the major and possibly the only
stargazin-like protein in the cerebellar granule cells of
wild-type mice and no other stargazin-like protein is
expressed at sufficient levels to rescue normal AMPA
receptor trafficking and maturation. The reason that

synaptic transmission to CA1 pyramidal cells in stg mice
is preserved is probably because, although γ2 is not
expressed in stg, the total remaining TARP expression levels in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells are adequate to
promote normal surface expression of mature AMPA
receptors at the postsynaptic membrane in this synapse.
It was therefore of great interest to examine whether the
expression patterns of the human stargazin-like proteins
paralleled those of mouse and if they were differentially
expressed in the various cell types of each tissue. This
study presents the differential distribution of γ2, γ3 and γ4
in human brain by northern blotting and more detailed
immunohistochemical analysis of their expression in
human cerebellum and hippocampus. In addition, we
used the results of our distribution study to investigate
whether the human γ2 and γ4 could modulate currents
gated by a VDCC complex heterologously expressed in
Xenopus oocytes that was assembled from the major
VDCC subunits expressed in a cerebellar Purkinje cell.

Results
Northern Blot analysis of mRNA distribution
The overall tissue distribution of human γ2, γ3 and γ4
mRNAs was analyzed by northern blotting. Specific cDNA
probes representing each gene were generated as
described in the methods and hybridized against a human
multiple-tissue northern blot (Figure 1A) and two brain
region blots (Figure 1B and 1C). The γ2-specific cDNA
probe detected two mRNAs of approximately 7 kb and 3
kb. Bands of similar size were reported in a mouse multiple-tissue blot probed with a murine γ2 cDNA probe [1].
Like mouse, the human γ2 mRNA transcripts were detected
only in brain (Figure 1A), and were particularly abundant
in cerebellum, cerebral cortex, occipital lobe, frontal lobe
and temporal lobe, hippocampus and thalamus (Figure
1B and 1C). γ2 transcripts were detected at somewhat
lower levels in medulla, putamen, amygdala and substantia nigra but only weakly in caudate nucleus. γ2 transcripts
were absent from corpus callosum and the sub-thalamic
nucleus and spinal cord.

A γ3 cDNA probe detected one 2.0–2.1 kb γ3 mRNA transcript which like γ2, was exclusively localized to the brain
(Figure 1A). However, γ3 mRNA was detected only in cerebral cortex, including occipital lobe, frontal lobe, and
temporal lobe, the putamen, caudate nucleus, amygdala
and hippocampus and was absent from all of the other
regions probed (Figure 1B and 1C).
The γ4-specific probe identified an mRNA of approximately 4 kb detected exclusively in brain (Figure 1A). This
was widely detected throughout the brain but was most
prevalent in the putamen and caudate nucleus. Unlike γ2
or γ3, γ4 mRNA was also weakly detected in spinal cord.

Generation and characterization of γ specific antisera
In order to investigate the distribution of the γ2, γ3 and γ4
proteins and to analyze their expression in different neuronal cell types we generated specific antisera against each
isoform. These were generated using peptide immunogens that were selected to be subtype-specific as determined by multiple sequence alignment. To confirm
activity against the corresponding holopeptide and lack of
cross-reactivity with the other subtypes, each of these
antisera were validated against the different subunit proteins recombinantly expressed in COS-7 cells. Cells were
transiently transfected with a pMT2 expression vector containing either the human γ2, γ3 or γ4 cDNAs, and 2–3 days
later were analyzed by immunocytochemistry. All three γ
isoforms could be readily detected and were localized
largely in the plasma membrane of the cells (Figure 2A).
The specificity of the antibodies (Abs) was confirmed by
incubating non-transfected cells with each primary Ab,
which in each case gave no immunoreactivity (Figure 2B).
Similar results were obtained when cells expressing one of
the γ isoforms were incubated with Abs directed against
either of the other two γ proteins (data not shown). Cells
transfected with a γ cDNA but which were not permeablized after fixation also exhibited no immunoreactivity
(Figure 2C). Since the peptide sequences chosen for
immunization are in the C-terminus, these results indicate
this portion of recombinantly expressed γ2, γ3 and γ4 is
located intracellularly. Co-transfection of VDCC subunits
CaV2.1 and β4 did not alter the expression pattern of the γ
proteins indicating that there are no effects on trafficking
and that the anti-γ Abs did not cross-react with the CaV2.1
or β4 subunits (data not shown).
Immunolocalization of γ2, γ3 and γ4 in human cerebellum
and hippocampus
Immunohistochemical analysis was carried out to examine the differential expression of γ2, γ3 and γ4 in human
cerebellum and hippocampus. Control experiments to
measure non-specific binding to tissue sections were performed by pre-absorbing antisera overnight with 100 µM
of the relevant peptide (Figures 3E and 3I, 4C and 4D, 5C
and 5D and 6B) and by omitting the primary antibody
(data not shown).
Cerebellum
Figure 3 shows the pattern of staining observed in the cerebellum using γ2, γ3 and γ4 specific antisera. Moderate γ2specific staining was seen in the molecular layer suggesting expression in the dendrites of cerebellar Purkinje neurons (Figure 3A). Small cell bodies in the molecular layer
that were most likely stellate or basket cell interneurons
also stained positively. The γ2 immunostaining was also
strong in the soma of Purkinje neurons extending to the
dendrites, but decreasing in intensity following the first
few bifurcations (Figure 3A). Cerebellar granule cells were

revealed that the γ2, γ3, and γ4 are exclusively detected in the brain. B & C. Brain region blots determined that the γ2 and γ4 are
almost ubiquitously expressed, but at differential levels in the same tissues. γ3 is more specifically localized to cerebral cortex,
amygdala, caudate nucleus and hippocampus. Size markers were from an RNA ladder provided on the blot by BD Biosciences
Clontech and the β-actin control probe results are displayed in the bottom panels.

layer was lightly to moderately stained, but the staining of
the Purkinje cell bodies and dendrites was striking. γ4
immunostaining extended well into the Purkinje cell dendritic arbors from the cell body indicating that γ4
expressed well throughout this cell type. The cell bodies
that stained positively in the molecular layer were small
interneurons. In the granule cell layer the interneurons
stained strongly for γ4 whereas the granule cells appear
unstained (Figure 3G). In the dentate cerebellar nucleus
(Figure 3H), γ4 immunostaining was detected strongly in
the perisomatic neuropil with only weak staining in the
cell bodies. Interestingly, this staining pattern was almost
the complete inverse of the γ2 immunostaining in the
same region (Figure 3C).

Positive staining for γ2, γ3, or γ4 (red) is strongly localized to

appropriate anti-γ Abs. D. When co-transfected together

panels represent 10 µm.

moderately stained for γ2 (Figure 3B), although assessment of immunostaining in this cell type was difficult
since the majority of cell volume is comprised of the
nucleus. The strongest γ2 immunostaining in this region
was actually in the interneurons. Figure 3C shows strong
γ2 immunostaining in the cell bodies of the dentate cerebellar nucleus with only weak to moderate staining in the
surrounding neuropil.
Very weak γ3 staining was observed in Purkinje cell bodies
and in the interneurons of the granule cell layer (Figure
3D). Staining of the molecular layer neuropil and the
granule cells is comparable to the peptide pre-absorption
control (Figure 3E). It is therefore possible that the γ3 protein is poorly represented in these particular cell types and
not completely absent from the cerebellum. No γ3 immunoreactivity was observed in the dentate cerebellar
nucleus (data not shown).
Staining of a human cerebellar folium for γ4 is shown in
Figure 3F. The molecular layer and adjacent granule cell

Hippocampus and dentate gyrus
Immunohistochemistry revealed differential expression
patterns for γ2, γ3 and γ4 in the different regions and cell
types of human hippocampus and dentate gyrus (Figure
4, 5 and 6). When incubated with the anti-γ2 Ab, generalized staining of the cell layers and neuropil throughout
the hippocampal formation was observed. In Figure 4A
the alveus, stratum oriens most adjacent to the CA1
pyramidal layer, and the pyramidal layer all stained moderately for γ2. The stratum radiatum and lacunosummoleculare stained much more weakly. The CA2 and CA3
pyramidal layers stain well for the γ2 subunit (Figure 4B)
and the intensity of staining in the alveus increased
slightly in this region. It is however apparent that there is
only a very weak staining of the strata oriens and radiatum
in the CA2/3 regions; yet, moderate immunostaining is
detected in the stratum lucidum. Weak staining is visible
in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare. In the same section
we also observed moderate γ2 staining in the molecular
layer of the dentate gyrus and strong immunostaining in
the granule cells (examined at higher magnification on
Figure 4H). The γ2 staining was weak or absent in the polymorphic layer, but distinct fibers were stained which
course across this region. Moderate staining of cell bodies
in CA4 was also observed (Figure 4B, top left portion of
the panel). Pre-absorption controls using the γ2 peptide
immunogen (Figures 4C and 4D) show the background
staining in a serial section of the same hippocampus as in
Figures 4A and 4B. The perisomatic staining in the stratum
pyramidale, in the region of the CA1 towards the CA2 was
moderate, with slightly more intense somatic staining
(Figure 4E). An apparently higher level of γ2 staining in the
CA2 and CA3 regions (Figures 4F and 4G) compared to
CA1 was probably due to a higher density of pyramidal
cell soma in these regions compared to the CA1 region
[30].

Staining for γ3 was absent from the alveus, stratum oriens,
stratum radiatum and lacunosum-moleculare, but the
pyramidal layer of the CA1, CA2 and CA3 regions of

layer immunoreactive to the γ4 Ab were small interneurons (i). G. Granule cell layer interneurons (i) stained much more
strongly for γ4 than the granule cells (g). H. The dcn gave a strong γ4 immunostaining signal in the perisomatic neuropil with

Ammon's horn strained strongly, with lesser
immunostaining in the subiculum and CA4 regions (Figure 5A and 5B). Closer examination revealed that the
pyramidal cell bodies stained strongly for γ3 and this staining was strongest in CA3 and became progressively weaker
through the CA2 and CA1 regions and into the subiculum. High power images of CA1 (Figure 5E), CA3 (Figure
5F), and subiculum (Figure 5G) determined that this was
most likely to be caused by increased cell densities in the
CA2/3 regions rather than more intense staining of
pyramidal neurons, although perisomatic staining was
more intense in the CA3 region than CA1, and absent
from the subiculum. Visible in Figure 5A and 5B, and also
observed at an increased magnification in Figure 5H, the
granule layer of the dentate gyrus is distinctly labeled
whereas the molecular and polymorphic layers display
weak or no immunostaining. The granule cells stained
moderately to strongly for γ3 and the immunoreactivity
was mainly in the soma of these cells, but could also be
seen in the early branches of the granule cell dendritic
trees, which extend into the lightly stained molecular
layer (Figure 5H).
At the macroscopic level, medium to strong γ4 immunostaining was seen throughout the pyramidal layers of
Ammon's horn and in the alveus (Figure 6A). The alveus
stained strongly for γ4 as did the cell bodies in the pyramidal layer of all CA regions. This was observed more clearly
at high power with a similar high level of staining of
pyramidal cell bodies throughout the CA1-4 regions, but
with the most intense perisomatic staining observed in
the CA2/3 region (Figure, 6C, 6D, and 6E). Weak to moderate staining was observed throughout the neuropil of
the strata surrounding the pyramidal layers in all regions.
In the dentate gyrus, the granule cell layer appears to stain
slightly more strongly than the adjacent molecular or polymorphic regions (Figure 6F). This also may be an artifact
of the cell density in the granule layer rather than
increased expression of the γ4 protein in the dentate granule cell bodies compared to their processes.
The effects of γ2 and γ4 on the biophysical properties of
CaV2.1 calcium channels
Since the role of the stargazin-like proteins in relation to
VDCC function remains controversial we examined the
effects of γ2 and γ4 on the biophysical properties of CaV2.1
calcium channels. Together with the CaV2.1 α subunit, we
co-expressed a β4 subunit with or without an α2δ2 subunit. These VDCC subunits are known to be highly
expressed in cerebellar Purkinje cells [31–38], a cell type
that, according to the immunohistochemistry data presented herein, strongly expresses both γ2 and γ4. Figure 7A
and 7B show the current-voltage relations of CaV2.1/β4
and CaV2.1/β4/α2δ2 VDCCs respectively, expressed in
Xenopus oocytes either in the presence or absence of γ2 or

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/4/23

γ4. Neither γ2 nor γ4 produced a statistically significant
shift in the half-maximal voltage of activation (V50act) of
CaV2.1/β4 (Table 1). The slope factor (kact), maximum
conductance (Gmax), and peak current amplitude at +10
mV were also very similar to controls on co-expression of
either γ2 or γ4 in the absence the α2δ2 subunit. Co-expression of the α2δ2 subunit was sufficient to significantly
increase the Gmax and peak current amplitude of a CaV2.1/
β4 Ca2+ channel complex (Figure 7A and 7B). However,
the increase was not affected by the additional co-expression of either γ2 or γ4.
No statistically significant differences were observed in
the half-maximal voltage of steady-state inactivation
(V50inact) or slope factor (kinact) of CaV2.1/β4 or CaV2.1/β4/
α2δ2 VDCCs co-expressing γ2 or γ4 (Figure 7C, 7D and 7E
and Table 2).

Discussion

Differential distribution of human stargazin-like γ mRNAs
The northern blot analysis described herein detected the
human γ2, γ3 and γ4 mRNAs only in the brain. Similar
mRNA distributions and transcript sizes have been
reported by in situ hybridization and northern blot for the
mouse orthologues [1,14,19] and these data are
supported by western blots [22]. We do not however rule
out the possibility that human γ2, γ3 and γ4 may be
expressed in some non-CNS tissues that are not included
on the multiple tissue northern blot used in this study.
Other laboratories that employed highly sensitive reversetranscriptase polymerase chain reaction expression analyses have reported that γ4 in particular is expressed in some
non-neuronal tissues [13,17]. The γ2 and γ4 transcripts
were detected in most of the brain regions probed and
mainly in the same tissues. However, in some regions
where both isoforms are detected, for example the cerebellum or thalamus, γ2 expression is higher than γ4, whereas
in the basal ganglia regions of putamen and caudate
nucleus γ4 mRNA is the more highly represented transcript. γ3 is much more selectively detected, but its expression is coincident with both γ2 and γ4 in all regions in
which it was detected by northern blot.

An additional observation was that these stargazin-like γ
proteins are differentially detected in some of the nuclei
that comprise the basal ganglia, a region believed to be
involved in the planning and programming of movement,
or more broadly in the processes by which intention is
converted into voluntary action. The putamen has a heterogeneous neuronal γ population with γ4 mRNA possibly
the most prevalent of the three γ transcripts investigated
herein, as has been previously observed in both mouse
and rat brain [14,25]. The caudate nucleus also expresses
transcripts for all three stargazin-like γ proteins, however
the signal detected with the γ2 probe was extremely weak

To analyze the voltage-dependent activation, current-voltage (I-V) relationships (Figure 7A and Figure 7B) were fitted with a modified Boltzmann
equation (see methods) to calculate V50act, the mid-point of voltage dependence of activation, kact, the slopefactor and Gmax, the maximum
conductance. Values are expressed as mean ± S. E. M. of the number of replicates, n. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests determined no
statistically significant changes in any pairs of data differing by the presence of a γ2 or γ4 P < 0.05 was considered significant). Statistically significant

Steady-state inactivation data from Figures 7C, 7D and 7E were fitted with a single Boltzmann function (see methods). Values are expressed as
mean ± S. E. M. of the number of replicates, n. In the presence of an α2δ2 subunit, neither γ2 nor γ4 caused statistically significant modulation of the
measured parameters according to an un-paired Student's t-test (P < 0.05 was considered significant). Equally, when the α2δ2 subunit was omitted
from the injection mixture, ANOVA determined no statistically significant changes in any pairs of data differing by the presence of a γ protein.

mined that the human γ2, γ3 and γ4 cDNA clones expressed
in vitro; it demonstrated the specificity of three anti-γ Abs,
one generated to detect each of the three isoforms; it
revealed that the stargazin-like γ2, γ3 and γ4 all localize to
the plasma membrane of COS-7 cells when expressed
either alone or in combination with other VDCC subunits
and finally it showed that COS-7 cells do not endogenously express γ2, γ3 or γ4. Furthermore, because the antiγ Abs, all of which were designed to detect epitopes in the
C-terminus after the fourth predicted transmembrane segment, failed to stain COS-7 cells that had not been
permeablized, it was established that the C-terminus is
localized to the membrane and inside the cell. If predictions of secondary structure as envisaged by other laboratories are correct, a tetra-spanning transmembrane
conformation will also place the N-terminus on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane [12,16].

The distribution of the γ2, γ3 and γ4 in cerebellum
This study is the first immunohistochemical analysis of
stargazin-like γ proteins in the human CNS. In the cerebellum, we observed that γ2 was detected in molecular,
granule and Purkinje cell layers as has been previously
reported for mouse γ2 protein [22] and mRNA [1,14,19].
A major difference between human and rodent immunostaining patterns was observed for γ4, which was detected
as very high levels in human cerebellar Purkinje cell bodies and processes, an observation not reported for rat or
mouse [22,25]. The detection of γ3 protein expression in
the human cerebellum, albeit at extremely low levels, was
similar to the γ3 mRNA detection patterns reported in
mouse or rat cerebellum [19,25] but disagree with the
findings on our northern blots and the in situ hybridization data of Klugbauer et al. [14]. The positive, albeit weak
detection of γ3 protein in cerebellar interneurons and low
levels detected in Purkinje cell bodies suggests that γ3 is

(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Neuroscience 2003, 4

expressed in distinct types of neurons in human cerebellum at levels too low to be detected by some hybridization
conditions.
The almost inverse staining patterns of γ2 and γ4 in the
dentate cerebellar nucleus (DCN) was striking. Much of
the perisomatic neuropil surrounding the DCN somata
consists of afferents from the Purkinje cells and is stained
particularly strongly for γ4 while the DCN cell bodies
stained strongly for γ2 but were devoid of γ4 staining. It is
therefore a reasonable assumption that γ4 is pre-synaptically localized in the Purkinje cell afferents to the DCN
whilst γ2 localizes to the post-synaptic regions of the DCN
cell bodies. Indeed this observation holds with the finding
that γ4 expressed well throughout Purkinje cell processes.
γ4 also appears to be localized in the GABAergic neurons
of the cerebellum more than the excitatory glutamatergic
cell types. In addition to showing strong immunostaining
throughout Purkinje cells, γ4 is detected in the interneurons of the molecular layer and also the Golgi interneurons of the granule layer. Whilst γ2 is also detected in all
these cell types, the γ4 immunostaining is noticeably
lower, if not absent from the excitatory granule cells, and
is absent from the DCN cell bodies.
The distribution of γ2, γ3 and γ4 in hippocampus
This study has determined that γ2, γ3 and γ4 show differential but overlapping expression patterns in the human
hippocampus and dentate gyrus. As is the case for the cerebellum, the expression patterns of γ2 and γ4 more closely
resemble one another than that of γ3. The γ2, and γ4 proteins were detected throughout the hippocampus and
dentate gyrus, although there were variations in the staining of cell bodies, dendrites and neuropil in the different
sub-fields. γ3 localized more specifically in the neuronal
cell bodies of the hippocampus and dentate gyrus. This
possibly indicates that γ2 and γ4 are involved in synaptic
modulation of neurotransmission throughout the cell,
whereas γ3 is solely involved in functions such as regulation of VDCCs or AMPA receptors in the cell soma.
CaV2.1/β4 VDCC currents are not modulated by human γ2
or γ4 co-expression in the presence or absence of an α2δ2
subunit
The co-expression of γ2 or γ4 with CaV2.1/β4 VDCCs in the
absence or presence of the α2δ2 subunit, did not
significantly affect peak current amplitude or any of the
activation or inactivation properties. These data agree
closely with the findings of Chen et al. [19] who recorded
whole cell Ca2+ currents from stg and wild type cerebellar
granule cells. They reported that absence of γ2 neither
altered the I-V relationship of the native whole cell Ca2+
current nor did it significantly modulate the steady-state
inactivation properties of VDCC current compared to wild
type. Although they did not use pharmacological agents to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/4/23

isolate specific components of the whole cell Ca2+ current
which might have highlighted subtle changes particular to
the P/Q-, N-, R-, or L-type currents present in this cell type
[39,40], it is unlikely that another known γ isoform could
functionally substitute for γ2 to maintain normal VDCC
function in that instance because distribution studies have
shown that they are probably not expressed in this cell
type [14,19,25]. This indicated that even if γ2 was associated directly or indirectly with a VDCC complex in cerebellar granule cells [20,22], it did not modulate the high
voltage activated VDCC I-V relationship or inactivation
properties.
More recent patch clamp recordings from stg thalamic
relay neurons showed a 45% increase in HVA VDCC peak
current densities compared to wild type [21] consistent
with a previous report that γ2 inhibited high voltage activated VDCC peak current amplitude by 37–40% when
expressed in Xenopus oocytes [20]. Why our data and those
of Chen et al. [19] are so different from these results may
be explained by differences in subunit combinations
expressed in granule cells and thalamic relay neurons and
between the two in vitro studies. Stargazin-like proteins
might be able to directly modulate VDCC complexes consisting of particular subunit combinations, but are unable
to reproduce this influence on other subunit complexes if
they required additional interacting proteins not present
in the Xenopus oocyte or cerebellar granule cells. The electrophysiological data therefore cannot be used as a strong
argument to warrant considering these γ proteins as an
integral part of high voltage-activated Ca2+ channels
because modulation of current properties has not been
reproducible between different studies. Nevertheless,
there is biochemical evidence for the association of γ2 and
γ3 with the N-type CaV2.2 channel [20,22] and it is quite
possible that whilst γ2, γ3 and γ4 readily associate with certain neuronal VDCC complexes, specific environmental
conditions must be met for them to exert a measurable
biophysical influence.

Conclusions

Human γ2, γ3 and γ4 stargazin-like proteins (or TARPs) are
detected solely in the CNS. On the whole, their differential distributions closely parallel those of their rodent
orthologues as observed by northern blot, in situ hybridization, western blot and immunohistochemistry
[1,14,19,22,25] with some notable exceptions. The differential expression pattern of each isoform among the cell
types present in human cerebellum and hippocampus
predicts specific roles for each subtype in neuronal function, and possibly even segregated VDCC-γ or AMPA
receptor-γ complexes [25]. The results of our electrophysiology experiments support the notion that γ2, γ3 and γ4
stargazin-like proteins are not "subunits" of VDCCs in the
true sense of the word. Nevertheless, we do not discount

(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Neuroscience 2003, 4

the possibility that they may interact with VDCCs and
possibly influence trafficking, assembly or integration of
VDCCs and AMPA-receptor function in their native environment or that to modulate VDCC current they require
other factors not endogenously expressed in Xenopus
oocytes.

Methods
cDNA sources and synthesis
Human brain total RNA was purchased from Invitrogen
(Paisley, UK) and used to generate cDNA using the Superscript Pre-amplification System (Invitrogen) primed with
random hexamers according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
Isolation and cloning of the γ2, γ3 and γ4 cDNAs
The complete open reading frame (ORF) of human
CACNG2 cDNA was amplified from 25 ng human brain
cDNA by PCR (cycling parameters: 98°C for 1 min, then
30 cycles of 98°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, 72°C for 2 min,
followed by a final 10 min extension step at 72°C) containing Pfu polymerase and 25 pmol each of the gene specific
primers
(GSPs),
5'GCGGCCGCACCATGGGGCTGTTTGATC-3' and 5'GCTAGCCTCGAGTTAGTGTTTATATAATGAAGAA-3'.
These amplify the ORF of CACNG2, with a 5' extension of
a Not I restriction site and partial Kozak sequence for initiation of translation in vertebrates (ACC) [41] and a 3'
extension of Xho I and Nhe I restriction enzyme sites.
Amplified fragments of the correct size were purified from
agarose gels using the Qiaex II kit (Qiagen, Crawley, UK),
and cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Positive colonies identified by blue/white screening were confirmed by EcoR I restriction digest of purified plasmid and
were sequenced on both strands using T7 (5'-TAATACGACTCACTAT AGGG-3') and M13R (5'-CAGGAAACAGCTATGAC-3') universal primers and gene
specific primers in an automated dye terminator
sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK).

The same procedures used to clone human CACNG2 were
followed to clone CACNG3 and CACNG4, but using the
primer pairs, 5'-CGGCCGCCACCATGAGGATGTGTGACAGAGGTA-3' and 5'-GCTAGCCTCGAGTCAGTTCAGACGGGCGTGG TG-3' to amplify CACNG3 ORF or, 5'GCGGCCGCACCATGGTGCGATGCGACCGCG-3' and
5'-GCTAGCCTCGAGTCACACAGGGGTCGTCCGTC-3' to
amplify CACNG4 ORF. These primer pairs contained the
same restriction enzyme sites and if appropriate, the partial Kozak sequence [41] in their 5' extensions as were
included in the CACNG2 primers. The human γ2, γ3, and
γ4 cDNAs were subcloned into the pMT2 vector for expression in Xenopus oocytes and COS-7 cells [42].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/4/23

Other cDNA clones
The following cDNAs were used: rabbit CaV2.1 (X57689),
rat β4 (LO2315) and mouse α2δ2 (AF247139, common
brain splice variant). All cDNAs were subcloned into
expression vector pMT2 [42].
Antibodies
Multiple sequence alignments and basic local alignment
search tool (BLAST) searches compared the protein
sequences of all known stargazin-like γ proteins with one
another and with other proteins in the public databases.
This identified regions of lowest homology between γ2, γ3
and γ4 that were not present in any other known proteins.
The following peptides, TARATDYLQASAITRIPS (γ2,
amino acids 211–228), FHNSTPKEFKESLHNNPAN (γ3,
amino acids 291–309) and VHDFFQQDLKEGFHVSMLN
(γ4, amino acids 303–321), were synthesized by standard
solid-phase techniques at Severn Biotech (Kidderminster,
UK) to generate specific polyclonal antibodies (Abs). Each
was coupled to the carrier protein tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD) using sulpho- Succinimidyl4- [Nmaleimidomethyl] cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC)
(Pierce, Tattenhall, UK) via a Cys residue added at the Nterminus during synthesis. To raise polyclonal anti-γ2,
anti-γ3 and anti-γ4 Abs, the resulting conjugates were used
to immunize Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG)-sensitized
Dutch rabbits at monthly intervals [43]. The immune
response was monitored by indirect enzyme-linked
immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) with free peptide-coated
micro-titer plates. Immunoglobulins from the terminal
bleeds were purified using immobilized peptide antigen
columns (Sulfo-link, Pierce). Each anti-γ Ab was checked
for specificity for its target by immunocytochemistry.
COS-7 cells transfected with a single stargazin-like γ protein cDNA were examined for positive staining following
incubation with the appropriate affinity purified Ab. Control slides were also examined for cross-reaction of the primary Ab with non-transfected COS-7 cells, stargazin-like γ
proteins other than the target against which the primary
Ab was intended to bind (data not shown) and the VDCC
α1, α2δ, and β subunits used in this investigation. Finally,
positive staining of target protein was abolished following
overnight pre-incubation (at 4°C) of the primary Ab with
a 10 × molar excess of the peptide against which it was
raised (data not shown).
Cell culture and transfections
COS-7 cell were cultured as previously described [44].
Transfection was performed using the Geneporter transfection reagent (Gene Therapy Systems, San Diego, CA).
Cells were plated onto coverslips 2–3 h prior to transfection. The DNA and Geneporter reagent (2 µg and 10 µl,
respectively) were each diluted in 500 µl of serum-free
medium, mixed, and applied to the cells. The α1, β, α2δ
and γ cDNAs were mixed and transfected in a 1:1:1:1 ratio

BMC Neuroscience 2003, 4

by DNA weight. If a particular cDNA was absent from the
transfection, substitution with blank pMT2 vector maintained correct subunit ratios. After 3.5 h, 1 ml of medium
containing 20% serum was added to the cells, which were
then incubated at 37°C for 3 days. Prior to staining, cells
were re-plated using a non-enzymatic cell dissociation
solution (Sigma, Dorset, UK) and maintained at 27°C for
between 2 and 6 h.
Immunocytochemistry
COS-7 cells were fixed and permeablized for immunocytochemistry essentially as previously described [44]. Primary Abs, affinity purified anti-γ2, anti-γ3 and anti-γ4 were
used at 0.2 µg/ml. Secondary biotin conjugated or goat
anti-rabbit (Sigma, Dorset, UK) Ab was applied at 5 µg/
ml. Texas red-conjugated streptavidin was applied at 3.3
µg/ml. The nuclear dye 4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI, 300 nM, Molecular Probes) was also used to visualize the nucleus. Cells were examined on a confocal scanning laser microscope (Leica TCS SP, Milton Keynes, UK).
All images were scanned sequentially to eliminate crosstalk and photomultiplier settings kept constant in each
experiment.
Northern blots
Human 12-lane multiple tissue blots and brain II and III
blots (BD Biosciences Clontech) were hybridized at 65° C
in ExpressHyb solution (BD Biosciences Clontech)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. The [α32P]
radiolabeled γ probes corresponding to nucleotides 597–
814, 560–792 or 594–804 of the γ2, γ3 or γ4 ORFs respectively, were assembled according to the Strip-EZ DNA
Probe Synthesis Removal Kit (Ambion (Europe) Ltd,
Huntingdon, UK). The final stringency wash performed
was 0.1 × Saline Sodium Citrate, 0.1% Sodium dodecylsulphate (SDS) at 65°C.
Human Brain Immunohistochemistry
Human brain tissue was obtained from two males aged 76
and 80 years whose causes of death were listed as metastatic carcinoma and left ventricular failure respectively.
No prior history of brain disease was noted. The tissue,
provided by the Cambridge Brain Bank Laboratory at the
University of Cambridge, U.K., was collected using ethical
consent procedures according to U.K. law. Sections were
fixed in neutral buffered formalin and processed to
paraffin wax. Paraffin-embedded wax blocks were sectioned on a Microm HM3555S microtome at 7 µm and
underwent a microwave antigen retrieval procedure using
a citrate buffer at pH 6.0 prior to immunostaining [45,46].
Endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 3% hydrogen
peroxide in water followed by non-specific protein blocking in 5% milk powder in phosphate buffered saline
(PBS). Sections were incubated overnight with primary Ab
(anti-γ2, 0.85 µg/ml; anti-γ3, 1.3 µg/ml; anti-γ4, 0.85 µg/

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/4/23

ml) diluted with 3% goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 at
4°C in a moist chamber. Treatment of all sections post
application of primary Ab was identical. Goat anti-rabbit
(1:20 dilution, Biogenex, Wokingham, UK) link Ab was
applied to all sections and incubated at room temperature
for 20 min, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Biogenex, prediluted (1/20)) that was
incubated for a further 20 min. Sections were visualized
using 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) solution made up
according to Vector kit SK-4100 (Peterborough, UK), and
incubated with the sections for 2–10 min. In a few cases,
sections were counterstained briefly in Mayer's hematoxylin prior to microscopic examination.
Negative control preparations performed in all immunohistochemistry experiments included replacement of primary antibodies with PBS only and preincubation of
primary antibodies with the 100 µM corresponding
immunizing peptide overnight at 4°C prior to
immunostaining.
Microscopy and image analysis
Slides were analyzed using a Zeiss Axioplan Optical
Microscope (Carl Zeiss Ltd., Welwyn Garden City, UK).
All sections were viewed under bright-field illumination
using × 2.5, × 10, × 20, or × 40 objectives and a stabilized
light source. For each tissue section, both The Central
Nervous System [47], and The Human Brain: an introduction to its functional anatomy [48] were used for reference, together with corresponding counterstained
sections to locate and define nuclear groups. A JVC KYF55B television camera attached to the microscope and a
PC running AcQuis image capture software (Syncroscopy,
Cambridge, UK) was used to obtain images of each
section.
Electrophysiology
Adult female Xenopus laevis were killed by anesthetic overdose in a 0.25% solution of tricaine, decapitated, and
pithed. Oocytes were removed and defolliculated by treatment with 2 mg/ml collagenase type IA in Ca2+-free ND96
saline containing (in mM): NaCl, 96; KCl, 2; MgCl2, 1;
and HEPES, 5, pH-adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH for 2 hr at
21°C. Plasmid cDNAs for the different VDCC subunits
were mixed in a weight ratio of 1:1:1:1, and ~10 nl was
injected into the nuclei of stage V or VI oocytes. In control
oocytes without a γ cDNA or in the absence of an α2δ
cDNA, an equal volume of water was substituted in the
mix. Injected oocytes were incubated at 18°C for 3–5 days
in ND96 saline (as above plus 1.8 mM CaCl2) supplemented with 100 µg/ml penicillin, 100 IU/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 2.5 mM Na pyruvate. Whole-cell
recordings from oocytes were made in the two-electrode
voltage-clamp configuration under continuous gravity-fed
superfusion (~1 ml/min) with a chloride-free solution

containing (in mM): Ba(OH)2, 10; TEA-OH, 80; NaOH,
25; CsOH, 2; and HEPES, 5 (pH7.4 with methanesulfonic
acid). In all experiments, oocytes were injected with 30–
40 nl of a 100 mM solution of K3-1, 2-bis (aminophenoxy) ethane-N, N, N', N'-tetra-acetic acid (BAPTA) in
order to suppress endogenous Ca2+-activated Cl- currents.
Recording microelectrodes, were pulled from thick-walled
borosilicate glass capillary tubing with the following
dimensions: 1.5 mm outer diameter, 1.0 mm bore diameter and with an internal 0.1 mm fiber (Plowden and
Thompson, Stourbridge, UK). The TEVC pipettes were
pulled using a P-87 Flaming/Brown microelectrode puller
(Sutter Instrument Company, Novato, CA). Electrodes
contained 3M KCl and had resistances of 0.3–2 MΩ. The
holding potential (VH) was -100 mV. Membrane currents
were recorded, amplified, low-pass filtered at 1 kHz using
a Geneclamp 500 B amplifier, digitized through a Digidata 1200 interface (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA)
and stored on a PC using data acquisition software
pClamp 6.02 (Axon Instruments). In all cases currents
were leak subtracted on-line by a P/4 protocol. Additional
analyses including calculation of means, standard error of
the mean (S. E. M.), significance (unpaired Student's ttests, where applicable) and curve fitting were calculated
using Origin 5.0 (OriginLab Corporation, Northampton,
MA). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and posthoc tests were performed using software available at http:/
/faculty.vassar.edu/lowry/VassarStats.htm. Where mean
values are presented they are shown as mean ± S. E. M.
(with n depicting the number of oocytes from which the
mean was calculated). Statistical significance was defined
as P < 0. 05.
Current-voltage (I-V) relation curves generated from currents activated by a 200 ms long depolarizing pulse were
fitted with a combined Boltzmann and linear fit function:

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/4/23

where I / Imax is the normalized peak current, V50inact is the
voltage for the mid-point of inactivation, V is the conditioning voltage and k is the slope factor for inactivation.

I = Gmax (V - Vrev) / (1 + exp(- (V - V50act) / k))
where I is the whole cell current amplitude, Gmax is the
maximum slope conductance, V0.5act is voltage of the midpoint of activation, Vrev is the reversal potential and k is
the slope factor for activation.
Steady-state inactivation data were generated from currents activated by a 100 ms long depolarizing pulse from
the holding potential (VH) to 0 mV immediately after a 25
s conditioning pre-pulse between -100 and 0 mV. Current
amplitudes were normalized to the maximum amplitude
and fitted with a Boltzmann function of the form:
