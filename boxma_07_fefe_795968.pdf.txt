Abstract
Background: The hydrogenosomes of the anaerobic ciliate Nyctotherus ovalis show how mitochondria
can evolve into hydrogenosomes because they possess a mitochondrial genome and parts of an electrontransport chain on the one hand, and a hydrogenase on the other hand. The hydrogenase permits direct
reoxidation of NADH because it consists of a [FeFe] hydrogenase module that is fused to two modules,
which are homologous to the 24 kDa and the 51 kDa subunits of a mitochondrial complex I.
Results: The [FeFe] hydrogenase belongs to a clade of hydrogenases that are different from well-known
eukaryotic hydrogenases. The 24 kDa and the 51 kDa modules are most closely related to homologous
modules that function in bacterial [NiFe] hydrogenases. Paralogous, mitochondrial 24 kDa and 51 kDa
modules function in the mitochondrial complex I in N. ovalis. The different hydrogenase modules have been
fused to form a polyprotein that is targeted into the hydrogenosome.
Conclusion: The hydrogenase and their associated modules have most likely been acquired by
independent lateral gene transfer from different sources. This scenario for a concerted lateral gene
transfer is in agreement with the evolution of the hydrogenosome from a genuine ciliate mitochondrion
by evolutionary tinkering.

Background
Hydrogenosomes are membrane-bounded organelles of
anaerobic unicellular eukaryotes that produce hydrogen
and ATP. These elusive organelles were discovered in trichomonad flagellates, and eventually identified in quite a
number of only distantly related unicellular anaerobes
such as flagellates, amoeboflagellates, chytridiomycete
fungi and ciliates [1-9]. Hydrogenosomes are phylogenetically related to both mitochondria and the various rudimentary,
"mitochondrial-remnant"
organelles
collectively called "mitosomes" [7,9]. The latter organelles
are found in organisms previously considered devoid of
mitochondria, that were once named "archaezoa" by Cavalier-Smith [10], although one of them, Trichomonas vaginalis, actually was already known to contain a
hydrogenosome.
The hydrogenosomes of the anaerobic ciliate Nyctotherus
ovalis possess a mitochondrial genome and parts of an
electron-transport chain on the one hand, and a hydrogenase on the other hand [11,12]. Because of this combination of features they cannot be classified as being either a
hydrogenosome or a mitochondrion. It is likely that this
organelle evolved from a ciliate mitochondrion by the
expression of a hydrogenase that enables the ciliate to use
protons as electron acceptors in order to maintain its metabolic homeostasis under anaerobic conditions. A crucial
aspect of this hypothesis is the evolutionary origin of the
N. ovalis hydrogenase itself. This is still a matter of debate
since phylogenetic analyses suffer from a lack of statistical
support due to an insufficient sampling of hydrogenases
[13-16].
Here we present evidence that the [FeFe] hydrogenase of
N. ovalis does not belong to the clade of "ancient eukaryotic" hydrogenases that also include the non-hydrogen
producing NARF's, (nuclear prelamine A recognition factors, [17]). The analysis of the H-cluster of 19 novel
hydrogenases from rumen ciliates that were recovered in a
metagenomic approach, reveals the existence of another
clade of [FeFe] hydrogenases from both bacterial and
eukaryotic organisms, including the one of N. ovalis, but
excluding hydrogenases from other ciliates and eukaryotes.
The [FeFe] hydrogenase of N. ovalis is unique because, by
a fusion with two NADH dehydrogenase subunits, it is
predicted to be capable of reoxidizing NADH directly. The
two accessory domains responsible for this are homologous to the 24 kDa and 51 kDa subunits of the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase (complex I) and to the
bacterial "small hydrogenases" hoxF and hoxU [11,16,18].
Supporting the origin of the hydrogenase by Horizontal
Gene Transfer we show here that the accessory domains
are not closely related to the N. ovalis complex I subunits,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/230

but rather appear to have been acquired by lateral gene
transfer from bacterial ancestors that possess a [NiFe]
hydrogenase.

Results and Discussion
The 24 kDa/NuoE/hoxF – and 51 kDa/NuoF/hoxU – like
regions of the [FeFe] hydrogenase polyprotein
The hydrogenase of N. ovalis is a polyprotein, consisting of
a long-type [FeFe] hydrogenase and two (C-terminal)
modules with similarity to the 24 kDa (NuoE) and 51 kDa
(NuoF) subunits of complex I of mitochondrial and
eubacterial respiratory chains (Fig. 1a) [13,14,18,19].
Complex I, the NADH-quinone oxidoreductase, consist of
14 subunits in eubacteria and of up to 46 subunits in
(human) mitochondria [20,21]. It catalyzes the electron
transfer from NADH to the quinone pool through a series
of redox centers. The 24 and 51 kDa subunits are two
important modules of the hydrophilic (soluble) NADH
dehydrogenase part of mitochondrial complex I. The 51
kDa subunit contains a [4Fe-4S]-cluster (also known as
"N3") and binding sites for NADH and FMN. The 24 kDa
subunit contains a [2Fe-2S]-cluster ("N1a") [22,23].

In N. ovalis two different types of 24/51 kDa genes are
found: (i) a hydrogenase variant, in which both subunits
are fused with each other and with a [FeFe] hydrogenase,
and (ii) a "mitochondrial" variant, in which the 24 kDa
and 51 kDa genes are located on separate minichromosomes (Fig. 1b). As usual for N. ovalis and some other ciliates, the genes are located on single gene containing
macronuclear minichromosomes that are capped with telomeres, making it unlikely that the genes are a contamination. Consistent with their putative function in the
"mitochondrial" (hydrogenosomal) complex I (see
below), these genes possess N-terminal leader sequences
that likely function as a mitochondrial targeting signal. In
contrast, the hydrogenase consists of a fusion of the
hydrogenase, the 24 kDa and the 51 kDa subunits. Obviously, this "operon" encodes a polyprotein, since it is
located on a single minichromosome, and, notably, it
possesses only one (N-terminal) "mitochondrial" targeting signal (Fig 1). In contrast, both "mitochondrial" 24
kDa and 51 kDa possess their individual mitochondrial
targeting signal. In addition, the "mitochondrial" 51 kDa
variant contains two small introns (not shown) that are
absent in the fused variant.
A multiple sequence alignment of the "mitochondrial"
complex I subunits and 24 kDa/hoxF and 51 kDa/hoxU like sequences of the hydrogenases of several N. ovalis species reveals that the hydrogenase modules are more similar to the nuoE and nuoF genes of a bacterial complex I
than to a mitochondrial complex I (Supplementary Material). The 24 kDa-like module of the N. ovalis hydrogenase
possesses only three of the four conserved cysteine resi-

dues that bind the [2Fe-2S] cluster N1a found in both
mitochondrial 24 kDa subunits and bacterial NuoE's. The
fourth cysteine residue of the hydrogenosomal [2Fe-2S]
cluster has been replaced consistently by a tryptophane in
all N. ovalis 24 kDa subunits sequenced (Additional File
[1]). Stereochemical considerations and mutagenisation
studies in bacterial nuoE genes have suggested that this C/
W replacement most likely does not interfere with the
ferredoxin-like function of the hydrogenosomal 24 kDa
module [24]. The 51 kDa-like region of both the hydrogenase domain and the putative mitochondrial complex I
subunits contain a NADH binding domain with four conserved glycine residues. In addition, also a FMN binding
site with its conserved glycine and proline residues, and
the four conserved cysteine residues of the [4Fe-4S] cluster
N3 are found in both the 51 kDa subunits of mitochondrial complex I and its bacterial NuoF homologues (Fig.
1b; supplementary material).

("51") module with a N3-type [4Fe-4S] cluster plus a FMN
and a NAD binding site. 1. b. The subunits of the "mitochondrial" complex I are localized on individual minichromosomes. They each possess a mitochondrial targeting signal
(M) and upstream and downstream non-coding DNA (N).
The "mitochondrial" 51 kDa module possesses two small
introns (arrows) that are absent from the correspondent
hydrogenase module.

Phylogenetic analysis of the 24 kDa-like region of the N.
ovalis hydrogenase is hampered by a lack of data, especially from ciliates and other protozoa. Nevertheless, it
shows clearly that this module of the N. ovalis hydrogenase has a bacterial rather than a mitochondrial ancestry
(Fig. 2). The 24 kDa-like module from the hydrogenase
clusters with its homologues from beta- and gamma-proteobacteria and the hoxF subunits of soluble NAD-reducing [NiFe]-hydrogenases of beta-proteobacteria, and not
with its mitochondrial paralogues. All 24 kDa-like genes
belonging to this clade are fused with their corresponding
51 kDa modules supporting the assumption of a close
phylogenetic relation (with the exception of Nitrosospira
multiformis). The mitochondrial 24 kDa (NuoE) subunit of
N. ovalis, on the other hand, clusters closely with its
homologues from aerobic, mitochondriate ciliates. This
clade belongs to a mitochondrial/alpha-proteobacterial
sample of sequences that are only distantly related to 24
kDa sequences from beta- and gamma- proteobacteria and
archaebacteria. None these sequences is fused with a 51
kDa gene.
Similar to the phylogeny of the 24 kDa modules, phylogenetic analysis of the 51 kDa module of the hydrogenase of
N. ovalis shows that it is closely related to the hoxF subunits of soluble NAD-reducing [NiFe]-hydrogenases of
beta-proteobacteria such as Rhodococcus opacus and Ralstonia eutropha, and the fused variants from beta- and gammaproteobacteria (Fig. 3). The hydrogenase module of N.
ovalis is more distantly related to the nuoF and 51 kDa
genes of the various representatives of alpha-proteobacterial or mitochondrial complex I genes. In contrast, the
mitochondrial 51 kDa subunit of N. ovalis clusters with
high support with its homologues from aerobic (mitochondriate) ciliates and many other eukaryotes and alphaproteobacteria. It is also clearly distinct from the corre-

sponding NADP/formate reducing hydrogenases of certain archaea and alpha proteobacteria (Fig. 3). These
observations unequivocally exclude a mitochondrial or
alpha-proteobacterial origin of the 24 and 51 kDa modules of the hydrogenase of N. ovalis.

dence for any close relationship to those bacterial taxa
that are supposed to be the source for the hydrogenosomal 24/51 kDa modules.(Fig. 2, 3,), indicating an independent origin for the hydrogenase on the one hand and
the 24/51 kDa modules on the other hand.

The phylogenetic analysis of the complete hydrogenase of
N. ovalis is hampered by the high sequence conservation
and the modular organisation of the bacterial and eukaryotic [FeFe] hydrogenases [15,19]. This implicates that
only the "H-cluster", a rather small piece of the total
hydrogenase, can be used in a phylogenetic analysis that
includes all eukaryotic [FeFe] hydrogenases. Also, the very
limited sampling of eukaryotic hydrogenases restricts the
phylogenetic reconstruction, suggesting an unresolved,
deep eukaryotic origin for most of these hydrogenases
[13-16]. Therefore, we undertook a metagenomic
approach to retrieve hydrogenase-encoding DNA
sequence information from the highly diverse and numerous community of anaerobic ciliates thriving in the
rumen of cattle, sheep, and goat [25,26]. Using primers
directed against conserved regions of the H-cluster (that is
shared by all [FeFe] hydrogenases and the functionally
unrelated NAR's [15]) we sequenced 10 clones derived
from the total rumen ciliate DNA. In addition, we determined the homologous DNA sequences from 9 validated
type strains of rumen ciliates. Phylogenetic analysis of this
extended data set reveals the existence of two clades of
eukaryotic [FeFe] hydrogenases, indicated by H1 and H2
in Figure 4. The H1 clade contains the majority of the
eukaryotic sequences, including the NAR'S.

The [FeFe] hydrogenase of N. ovalis is chimeric and has
been acquired by lateral gene transfer
As shown above, the 24 kDa and 51 kDa modules of the
hydrogenase of N. ovalis are neither of mitochondrial nor
of alpha-proteobacterial origin. Given the presence of paralogues of genuine mitochondrial descent that encode
constituents of a functional mitochondrial/hydrogenosomal complex I [11], an acquisition of the whole hydrogenase by lateral gene transfer from different sources is
very likely.

The H2 clade comprises all hydrogenase sequences from
N. ovalis and its intestinal and free-living relatives. In addition, the H-clusters from two rumen ciliates, one amoeboflagellate, and the ciliate Trimyema sp. belong to this clade
– besides sequences from the delta-proteobacterium Desulfovibrio vulgaris and the alpha-proteobacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris. A bacterial, i.e. endo/episymbiotic
origin of the sequences derived from the two rumen ciliates and the ciliate Trimyema cannot be excluded at the
current state of information. The ciliate origin of the N.
ovalis sequences has been confirmed by their assignment
to gene-sized macronuclear chromosomes that are characteristic for Nyctotherus and its relatives. Furthermore, the
codon usage is characteristic for N. ovalis (see below). The
hydrogenase of the amoeboflagellate Psalteriomonas lanterna, on the other hand has recently been recovered from
cDNA thereby revealing the absence of C-terminal 24/51
kDa modules (unpublished). Thus, the existence of two
different eukaryotic hydrogenase clades is clearly supported, with a clustering of the N. ovalis sequence with
those from Desulfovibrio vulgaris and Rhodopseudomonas
palustris. The relationship of both clades to other bacterial
hydrogenases remains poorly resolved, but there is no evi-

Both the 24 kDa and 51 kDa modules might have been
acquired from beta-proteobacteria similar to Rhodococcus
or Ralstonia, which possess [NiFe] hydrogenase modules,
rather than [FeFe] hydrogenases [19]. Notably, in Rhodococcus or Ralstonia the 24 kDa and 51 kDa subunits belong
to a rather oxygen-resistant [NiFe] hydrogenase, which is
not homologous to the [FeFe]-hydrogenases [1316,18,19,27,28]. An analysis of the codon usage of the
various hydrogenase components and their mitochondrial orthologues (Fig. 5) reveals that (1) the hydrogenase
modules have acquired the host-specific codon-usage, (2)
hydrogenase modules cluster with hydrogenase modules,
and (3) mitochondrial genes with mitochondrial genes.
Why acquire a [FeFe]-only hydrogenase?
We have shown recently that the hydrogenosome of N.
ovalis is a ciliate-type mitochondrion that produces hydrogen [11]. The presence of a mitochondrial genome, mitochondrial complex I and II dependent respiratory-chain
activity, in combination with a kind of fumarate-respiration identifies the N. ovalis hydrogenosome as an intermediate stage in the evolution of mitochondria to
hydrogenosomes [11,12]. But why acquire a [FeFe]hydrogenase at all? It is likely that the ancestral mitochondrion
of N. ovalis oxidised NADH via an electron transport chain
– as indicated by the presence of genes encoding components of mitochondrial complex I and II. An adaptation to
anaerobic environments might be greatly facilitated by
the acquisition of a hydrogenase, which could use NADH.
It is obvious that the use of fumarate alone as endogenous
electron acceptor requires a well-controlled balance
between the various catabolic and anabolic reactions in
the cell. Depending on the metabolic state of the cell, the
NADH pool might be subject to large fluctuations. The
presence of alternative oxidases in anaerobic mitochondria provides a means for the cell to cope with such fluctuations in the NADH pool [29]. Such an alternative
oxidase appears to be absent in N. ovalis, and the hydro-

fusion of the H-cluster with the 24 and 51 kDa modules has so far only been observed for the N. ovalis clade. The Psalteriomonas hydrogenase has no fused 24/51 kDa modules.

Principal5component analysis of the codon-usage of the hydrogenase and mitochondrial 24/51 kDa modules
Principal component analysis of the codon-usage of the hydrogenase and mitochondrial 24/51 kDa modules. While most of the
N. ovalis strains exhibit only slight differences in codon-preference, the isolate N. ovalis from the host cockroach P. americana
strain Amsterdam has a substantially different codon-usage. In both cases, the bacterial-derived 24 and 51 kDa modules
acquired the typical ciliate codon-usage that is not significantly different from the one used for the (nuclear-encoded) mitochondrial modules. Even the top-down distribution shows a complete ameliorisation of the modules.
genase could fulfil the task to regulate the NADH pool.
The chimeric [FeFe]-hydrogenase of N. ovalis is tailored for
this requirement since it allows a direct re-oxidation of
NADH, due to the presence of the 24 and 51 kDa modules. Other [FeFe] hydrogenases, e.g. those of Trichomonas
vaginalis, require ferredoxin for hydrogen production
from PFO-generated reduction equivalents, and a diaphorase to reoxidise NADH. Thus, a hydrogenase like the one
found in N. ovalis, provides many advantages for an
organism adapting to anaerobic environments. Since
there is no evidence for the presence of hydrogenases in
mitochondria/protomitochondria [30,31], the scenario
for the evolution of the hydrogenosomes of N. ovalis from
ciliate mitochondria as described here, is likely to have
involved complex lateral gene transfer and the fusion of

functional domains. The fusion of genes of different origin has at least two advantages: guaranteeing the synthesis
of all components in equimolar amounts, and facilitating
the flow of electrons from NADH to H+ in a single molecule. Lastly, the evolution of a hydrogenosomal polyprotein requires only the acquisition of a single
mitochondrial targeting signal, which can be acquired
easily as demonstrated by the frequent retargeting of proteins in the evolution of the eukaryotic cell [31,32].
Hydrogenases and the origin of mitochondria
The scenario depicted here for the origin of the N. ovalis
hydrogenase, in which a hydrogenase was added to an
aerobic mitochondrion does not necessarily hold for
other hydrogenosomes, because they have evolved inde-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:230

pendently of N. ovalis and because they are metabolically
less similar to mitochondria than is the N. ovalis organelle,
e.g. in the way they metabolise pyruvate. N. ovalis uses a
"mitochondrial" pyruvate dehydrogenase that reduces
NAD, which can subsequently be reoxidized by the hydrogenase that has acquired NADH-oxidizing domains. In
contrast, the hydrogenosome of Trichomonas species
metabolise pyruvate via a pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase[1] and the anaerobic chytrids metabolise it via a
pyruvate formate-lyase[33]. The proteins in the hydrogenosomes of anaerobic chytrids are phylogenetically
related to the proteins in the mitochondria of aerobic
fungi, suggesting also here the evolution of the hydrogenosome as a secondary adaptation to anaerobic circumstances. Trichomonas, however, appears in many-sequence
based phylogenies at the root of the eukaryotic tree and
does not have aerobic, mitochondria containing relatives.
A scenario as depicted in the hydrogen hypothesis of Martin and Müller [34], in which the ancestral organelle of all
mitochondria and hydrogenosomes had both a respiratory chain and a hydrogenase can therefore not be ruled
out. It should thereby be noted that T. vaginalis, just like
N. ovalis has the NADH oxidizing elements of complex I,
but, in contrast to N. ovalis, does not have the other proteins of this complex [35], and is with respect to complex
I more like Schizosaccharomyces pombe [21].

Conclusion
N. ovalis acquired its unique [FeFe] hydrogenase by lateral
gene transfer from two different sources. Given that N.
ovalis performs a kind of fumarate respiration allowing
survival under anaerobic conditions, the acquisition of
this peculiar [FeFe] hydrogenase allows an additional regulation of the NADH pool, which is crucial for maintaining the metabolic homeostasis under anaerobic
conditions.

Methods
Isolation (and culture) of the ciliates
N. ovalis was isolated from the hindgut of the cockroaches
Periplaneta americana strains Amsterdam (PA), Bayer (PB),
Dar es Salaam (PD), Nijmegen(PN) and Blaberus sp.
strains Düsseldorf (BD) and Amsterdam (BA) taking
advantage of the unique anodic galvanotaxic behaviour of
N. ovalis [36].Euplotes sp. was grown in Erlenmeyer flasks
containing 500 ml artificial seawater (465 mM NaCl, 10
mM KCl, 53 mM MgCl2, 28 mM MgSO4, 1.0 mM CaCl2,
and 0.23 mM NaHCO3). Since Euplotes sp. requires living
bacteria for growth, E. coli XL1-blue was supplied at regular intervals. Alternatively, a small piece of beef-steak
(approximately 1 cm3) was placed into the culture
medium to allow the growth of food bacteria. Euplotes sp.
cells were harvested 28 days after the start of a new culture
by filtration through a 4 μm plankton gaze.

Rumen ciliates were isolated by electromigration from the
rumen fluid of a grass-fed, fistulated Holstein-Friesian
cow, and lysed immediately after the isolation in a 8 M
solution of guanidinium chloride and stored at minus
25°C until use.
DNA isolation, total RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis
DNA of N. ovalis and Euplotes sp. was isolated according to
van Hoek et al. [37]. Total rumen ciliate DNA was prepared after purification on a hydroxyapatite column (BioRad) using standard methods. Total RNA of N. ovalis was
isolated using the RNeasy Plant mini-kit (Qiagen). Adaptor-ligated cDNA was prepared according to the SMART™
RACE cDNA Amplification kit (Clontech).

Isolation of the H-cluster, the 24 kD (hoxF) and 51 kD
(hoxU) modules of the hydrogenase gene, and mitochondrial-type 24 kDa and 51 kDa subunits of mitochondrial
complex I
H-clusters of Fe-hydrogenases were amplified from total rumen
ciliate DNA using PCR with primers described earlier [15]. In
addition, DNA from type-strain rumen ciliates, kept by the
ERCULE consortium was used as template for PCR.
To isolate the (nuclear-encoded) 24 kD (hoxF) and 51 kD
(hoxU) -like genes, the primer-design was based on the Hcluster and the 24 kD (hoxF) and 51 kD (hoxU) region of
the hydrogenase of N. ovalis PN [18]. Their sequences are
5'-gtnatggcntgyccngghgghtg-3' (H-cluster forward primer)
and 5'-ccntcyctrcadggnacrcaytg-3' (51 kDa reverse primer
1). Sequence-specific internal primers were designed to
isolate the termini of the gene-sized chromosomes in
combination with a telomere-specific primer using the telomere suppression PCR method [38,39].
To isolate the (nuclear) genes encoding the 24 kDa and 51
kDa subunits of mitochondrial complex I, respectively,
primers were based on conserved amino-acid regions of
mitochondrial complex I genes. Their sequences are 5'tgyggwachachccwtg-3' (24 kDa forward primer), 5'-ccnarrcaytcdacytc-3' (24 kDa reverse primer), 5'-gmhgargghgarccwgghac-3' (51 kDa forward primer), and 5'cangwcatytcytcytcnac-3' (51 kDa reverse primer). The
ORFs were completed as described above.
Phylogenetic analysis
The amino acid sequences of the H-cluster were aligned
using Clustal × 1.81 [40]. The program Gblocks [41] was
used to identify regions of defined sequence conservation
and exclude ambiguously aligned positions from the
alignment. The phylogenetic analysis of the sequences
were performed with the program MRBAYES version 3.1.2
[42]. Markov chain Monte Carlo from a random starting
tree was initiated and run for 2 million generations. In

these analyses, the JTT model of amino acid substitution
and four gamma distributed rates of evolution were
applied. Trees were sampled every 1000th generation. The
first 25% of the samples were discarded as 'burn-in', and
the rest of the samples were used for inferring a Bayesian
tree. Examination of the log-likelihood and the observed
consistency with the similar likelihood values between
the two independent runs suggest that the run reached stationarity and that these burn-in periods were sufficiently
long.
The accession numbers of the sequences used to calculate
this tree are Nyctotherus ovalis BA AY608627; N. ovalis PN
CAA76373; the sequences from rumen ciliates have been
deposited in GenBank under accession numbers
AM396939 – AM396957
For the 24kD/51kD domains less sequences had to be
included to delineate the evolution, allowing a "manual"
sequence alignment and phylogeny approach. Alignments of representative sequences from the 24kD/51kD
domains were generated with MUSCLE [43]. Sequences
were edited and the most relevant parts from the alignments were selected manually using Seaview [44]. Phylogenies were subsequently derived using the program
PHYML [45] using the JTT model and an estimated
number of invariable sites with four substitution rate categories. 100 bootstraps were performed; they are only
indicated in the tree if they are ≥ 50.
