comparison of the population genetic structures

Pygmy Gerbil and the common Anderson's Gerbil

Abstract
Background: One of the major challenges in evolutionary biology is identifying rare species and devising
management plans to protect them while also sustaining their genetic diversity. However, in attempting a broad
understanding of rarity, single-species studies provide limited insights because they do not reveal whether the factors
that affect rare species differ from those that affect more common species. To illustrate this important concept and to
arrive at a better understanding of the form of rarity characterizing the rare Gerbillus henleyi, we explored its population
genetic structure alongside that of the locally common Gerbillus andersoni allenbyi. We trapped gerbils in several
locations in Israel's western and inner Negev sand dunes. We then extracted DNA from ear samples, and amplified two
mitochondrial sequences: the control region (CR) and the cytochrome oxidase 2 gene (CO2).
Results: Nucleotide diversity was low for all sequences, especially for the CR of G. a. allenbyi, which showed no diversity.
We could not detect any significant population genetic structure in G. henleyi. In contrast, G. a. allenbyi's CO2 sequence
showed significant population genetic structure. Pairwise PhiPT comparisons showed low values for G. henleyi but high
values for G. a. allenbyi. Analysis of the species' demographic history indicated that G. henleyi's population size has not
changed recently, and is under the influence of an ongoing bottleneck. The same analysis for G. a. allenbyi showed that
this species has undergone a recent population expansion.
Conclusions: Comparing the two species, the populations of G. a. allenbyi are more isolated from each other, likely due
to the high habitat specificity characterizing this species. The bottleneck pattern found in G. henleyi may be the result of
competition with larger gerbil species. This result, together with the broad habitat use and high turnover rate
characterizing G. henleyi, may explain the low level of differentiation among its populations. The evidence for a recent
population expansion of G. a. allenbyi fits well with known geomorphological data about the formation of the Negev
sand dunes and paleontological data about this species' expansion throughout the Levant. In conclusion, we suggest
that adopting a comparative approach as presented here can markedly improve our understanding of the causes and
effects of rarity, which in turn can allow us to better protect biodiversity patterns.
Background
Studying rare species and devising management plans to
protect them constitute major themes in ecology [e.g.

and to prevent biodiversity loss. Classical views in evolu* Correspondence: rotkopf@bgu.ac.il, oferovad@bgu.ac.il

tionary ecology define a rare species as one with a low
abundance and/or a small range [2]. However, rarity can
also be characterized by factors such as habitat specificity, taxonomic distinctness, and persistence through ecological or evolutionary time, all of which have been
considered either as additional components by which
rare species can be identified or as constraints which confer upon species with low abundances or small-sized
ranges the rare status [2-4]. For instance, Rabinowitz [3]
and Rabinowitz et al. [4] suggested categorizing plant

species according to geographic range (large or small),
local population size (large or small) and habitat specificity (wide or narrow). These three states generate eight
possible combinations, seven of which constitute forms
of rarity. A similar study carried out on mammals [5]
revealed a bimodal pattern of rarity and commonness,
with an overabundance of species in the relatively rarest
and most common categories.
Identifying the causes of rarity often leads to the following question: Are rare species rare because they are only
capable of exploiting a narrow range of environmental
conditions, or because the spatial extent of the conditions
they can exploit is highly restricted, or both? All species
are limited to some extent by environmental variables (i.e.
abiotic and biotic), but the question is whether there is a
tendency for the abundances and range sizes of rare species to be predominantly constrained by particular factors or combinations of factors [2]. For instance, a species'
rarity may indicate that it is being affected more heavily
by competition or predation than a more common congener [e.g. [6]].
Recently, there has been a growing awareness among
conservation biologists that molecular techniques can be
better exploited to interpret the history, present status,
and future prognosis of threatened species [7]. Moreover,
combined with data from other disciplines (e.g. reproduction, infectious diseases, and field ecology), the synthesis offers valuable insight that is directly applicable to
species management plans [7]. For example, the quest for
the most suitable population for translocation or as a
source for restoration could benefit immensely from recognizing locally adaptive genetic diversity within evolutionarily significant units. In such a case, adaptive genetic
differences among populations can lead to outbreeding
depression if divergent populations are mixed [8].
Attempts to devise a broad understanding of rarity will
accrue only limited insight from single-species studies
[9], which do not reveal how the factors that control
abundances and range sizes vary between rare species
and more common species [2]. As such, comparisons
between rare species and common congeners are essential to gain further insight about rarity. For example,
Wahlberg et al. [10] used data on an abundant butterfly
species to estimate the parameters of the incidence function model of an endangered congener, thus demonstrating the usefulness of studying a rare species alongside a
common congener. Yet, studies of this kind, especially on
animals, are scarce [but see [11]].
To illustrate the importance of this comparative
approach, we explored the population genetic structure
of the rare Pygmy Gerbil (Gerbillus henleyi) and the
locally common congener Anderson's Gerbil (Gerbillus
andersoni allenbyi), while contrasting their demographic
histories. Doing so enabled us to form a better mechanis-

tic understanding of the type of rarity that characterizes
the Pygmy Gerbil, i.e. rarity signified by widespread
global distribution, low habitat specificity, and small population size. This form of rarity is especially difficult to
explain, since one would expect such small populations to
die out and that the species subsequently persist in fewer
but larger populations.
Our working hypothesis was that the type of rarity evident in G. henleyi may persist in two forms that differ
from one another in the level of connectivity between
populations. Our null hypothesis was that the form of
rarity exhibited by G. henleyi can persist by maintaining a
high level of connectivity between populations. This
hypothesis relies on two characteristics inherent to the
species, its high mobility [12] and its ability to exploit several habitat types [12-15]. We thus predicted that since G.
henleyi populations are not isolated, they should demonstrate fairly low levels of genetic differentiation. Alternatively, it is possible that G. henleyi exists in small, isolated
populations. This latter pattern should be manifested by
higher levels of genetic differentiation between populations.
Regarding G. a. allenbyi, we hypothesized that its larger
body size (i.e. higher mobility) and larger population size
(i.e. a potential source for dispersal events) will increase
the connectivity between populations, especially those
within the western Negev sand dunes. However, its high
specificity to sand [16], relative to G. henleyi (see Methods), may decrease the connectivity between the western
Negev sand dunes (Figure 1a-f) and the inner sands populations (Figure 1g, h) (no sandy connection exists
between these two regions). We thus expected to find lit-

in the inner sand dunes of Mishor Rotem [14]. On sand,
population densities of G. a. allenbyi (40-120 individuals
per hectare, according to Abramsky [22] are much higher
than those of G. henleyi (1 individual per hectare, according to Shenbrot et al.[12]).

Methods

Samples and laboratory procedures

Study area

The four sand dune regions of Israel include: 1) the
coastal and 2) western Negev dunes, which together form
the eastern boundary of the Saharan sands and originate
from material carried by the Nile and deposited along the
Mediterranean coast, 3) the inland dunes of the Negev
(Mishor Rotem, Mishor Yamin, and Mamshit), which
derive from locally eroded tertiary rocks, and 4) the sands
of the Arava valley, produced mostly by the erosion of
local Nubian sandstones of the lower Cretaceous period
[17]. G. a. allenbyi and G. henleyi both occur in the western and inland Negev dunes. No sandy connection exists
between these two regions (Figure 1).
Study species

The Pygmy Gerbil, G. henleyi (body mass 9.5 g), is a
widely distributed species that ranges from the Arabian
peninsula in the east to Morocco in the west and from the
African Mediterranean coast in the north to Senegal,
Burkina Faso, Chad, and Yemen in the south [12]. G. henleyi seems to be a generalist species-in Israel, it has been
trapped in sand dunes, gravel plains, wadis, and on loess
and cobble substrate adjacent to sand dunes [13-15], and
it is considered rare on all those substrates [14,18]. In a
study conducted in Makhtesh Ramon [12] average G.
henleyi densities were between 0.9-2.3 individuals per
hectare, depending on habitat type. The population of G.
henleyi exhibits a high level of individual turnover, suggesting high mobility rates [12]. The average duration of
uninterrupted presence of an individual on a sampling
plot varies between different habitats, with permanent
habitation found only in wadis and gravel plains [12]. G.
henleyi is more mobile and its home ranges are less stable
than those of either G. dasyurus [19] or G. gerbillus [12].
Negative interactions with congeners (specifically G. a.
allenbyi and G. pyramidum) were found to be a major
cause for the scarcity of G. henleyi in Israel [20].
Anderson's Gerbil, G. a. allenbyi (body mass 26 g),
occurs along the Mediterranean coast from Tunisia
through Libya and Egypt to the Sinai and Israel. In Israel,
it occurs in sand dunes that are covered with vegetation,
as well as on fossilized sandstone hills along the coastal
plain from the Egyptian border and north to Mount Carmel, and in the western and northern Negev. Its distribution in Israel was originally reported to be limited to the
coastal sand dunes [13]. Ritte et al. [21] found the species
in the western Negev sand dunes, and later it was found

We sampled G. henleyi and G. a. allenbyi populations at
several locations in the western Negev and in the inner
sands (Figure 1). In each location, our goal was to trap 20
individuals of each species by setting 320 Sherman folding live-traps (23 × 8 × 9 cm) for three consecutive nights.
Baited with millet seeds, the traps were set in the late
afternoon and checked at dawn. Sampling consisted of
recording species, sex, head width, hind foot length, tail
length, and body mass. We anesthetized each animal with
isoflurane and collected a small sample of ear tissue in
95% ethanol. Animals that were trapped for a second time
(identifiable by their clipped ears) were released without
further sampling. All required permits for this work were
obtained from Israel's National Parks Authority (NPA),
permit no. 2006/26425.
We extracted total DNA from each ear sample using
the DNEasy Tissue Kit (QIAGEN 2004) or the Wizard® SV
Genomic DNA Purification System (Promega). A fragment of the mitochondrial control region (335 bp) was
amplified and sequenced using the CBT (5'-CCGCCATCAACACCCAAAGCTG-3') and MR1 (5'-CCCTGAAGTAAGAACCAG ATGCCTG-3') primers [23]. Another
fragment, comprising part of the CO1 gene, the CO2
gene, and part of the ATPase 8 gene (1407 bp), was amplified and sequenced using the F6520 (5'-GCWGGMTTYGTNCACTGATTCCC-3')
and
R7927
(5'GAGGMRAAWARATTTTCGTTCAT-3') primers [24].
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification was carried out using PCR-Ready™ High Specificity microtubes
in a PTC-200 thermal cycler. Reactions were carried out
in 25-μL volumes that included 1 μL of 10-μM primer
and 2 μL of the DNA template. The cycle profile for the
control region consisted of denaturation at 94°C (1 min),
annealing at 63°C (1 min), and extension at 72°C (1 min)
for 35 cycles. This profile was preceded by an initial cycle
with a 5-min denaturation at 94°C, and it was followed by
a final cycle with a 7-min extension step at 72°C. The only
difference for the CO2 region was an annealing temperature of 53°C. PCR products were purified using the Invisorb® Spin PCRapid kit and stored in TE at -20°C.
Quantifying genetic diversity and population structure

We estimated genetic diversity at the mtDNA level by calculating the number of polymorphic sites, the number of
haplotypes, and the nucleotide diversity, Pi (π - the average number of nucleotide differences per site between
two sequences [25](equations 10.5 or 10.6). We tested for

Rotkopf et al. BMC Ecology 2010, 10:15
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/10/15

evidence of population structure using analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA), which was calculated with
GenAlex, ver. 6.3 [26]. Additionally, levels of genetic
divergence between samples were calculated with the fixation index PhiPT [27], an estimator that includes information on haplotype frequency and molecular distance
(calculated with GenAlex, ver. 6.3). We tested for isolation by distance by comparing genetic against geographical distances using Mantel tests. The protein-coding
sequence was divided into two separate sequences: partial CO1 and partial CO2. In each of these sequences,
synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions were
identified. Positions of substitutions are described as
amino-acid locations inferred from an alignment with
reference sequences of Mus musculus acquired from the
NCBI RefSeq protein database [Genbank:YP001686700
for CO1, NP904331 for CO2].
Four haplotype networks (for G. henleyi's CR, CO2 and
the combination of both, and for G. a. allenbyi's CO2)
were constructed to examine the evolutionary relationships between mtDNA haplotypes, and thus identify geographically localized clades. The phylogenetic
relationships between the mtDNA haplotypes were
determined using the program NETWORK 4.5.1.6 [28].
Networks were calculated by the median-joining method
(ε = 0) [29] and subsequent MP calculation [30].
Inferring demographic histories

We used the D statistic of Tajima [31], D* and F* statistics
of Fu and Li [32] and FS statistics of Fu [33] to test for
deviation of sequence variation from evolutionary neutrality. Negative values of these statistics are most often
attributed to positive selective sweeps (resulting in
genetic hitchhiking), recent population growth, or background selection. Used in combination, these tests can
provide evidence for or against particular evolutionary
mechanisms [34]. All tests and calculations of significance from coalescent simulations were conducted using
version 4.2 of DnaSP [35].
To test for traces of historic rapid population expansion, we used mismatch distribution analyses. We also
created a segregating sites graph to examine the distribution of mutations throughout the population. The former
distinguishes between the smooth, unimodal distribution
of a recently expanded population shaped by the accumulation of mutations with minimal lineage loss and the
"ragged", multimodal distributions shaped by mutations
in equilibrium with stochastic lineage loss [36-38]. The
significance of the "raggedness" statistic [39] was used to
differentiate between the two patterns.
The use of mismatch distributions may generate spurious, but seemingly precise results. We thus also used a
Bayesian coalescence framework to simulate the demographic history of both gerbil species. Specifically, we

estimated the past population dynamics through time
using the method of Bayesian skyline plot [40], implemented in BEAST [41]. This method allows estimating
past population dynamics from a sample of molecular
sequences without dependence on a pre-specified parametric model of demographic history. It takes into
account both the error inherent in phylogenetic reconstruction and the stochastic error intrinsic to the coalescent process, and thus produces more correct estimates
of statistical uncertainty. In addition, the Monte CarloMarkov Chain (MCMC) sampling procedure, implemented in BEAST [41], allows simultaneous estimation
of the ancestral genealogy, and parameters of the substitution process and demography. Sequences were simulated down the tree using the general time-reversible
(GTR) model and empirical base frequencies, while also
allowing for a heterogeneous (four-category gamma distribution) mutation rate among sites. The number of
groups (m) was set to 20 for G. henleyi, and 5 for G. a.
allenbyi. MCMC chains were run for 10,000,000 iterations of which the first 10% were discarded to allow for
burn-in. Genealogies and model parameters were sampled every 1,000 iterations, and the results were summarized in piecewise-constant Bayesian skyline plots. We
assumed a strict molecular clock model, where evolutionary rate was expressed in mutations per site per year,
assuming it is normally distributed with a mean equal to
27.4 × 10-9 [42], and a standard deviation of 10 × 10-9. We
used a relatively high standard deviation due to the high
variability in mutation fixation rates in different regions
of the mitochondrion.
We also calculated the level of linkage disequilibrium
(the proportion of polymorphic sites exhibiting significant, non-random associations). If a certain gene in the
mitochondrion underwent strong positive selection, one
would expect to find significant associations, because of
genetic hitchhiking, between polymorphic sites. Slatkin
[43] demonstrated that the probability of detecting linkage disequilibrium between (neutral) loci in mtDNA is
greatly diminished in a population that recently
expanded. This is a result of the accumulation of new
mutations when haplotype loss is minimal. Only parsimony-informative sites were used in this analysis. All calculations were performed using DnaSP, version 4.2 [35].
Phenotypic variability

If life history and morphology are entirely genetically
determined, patterns of trait variation within and among
different populations should be correlated with the
degree of genetic differentiation they exhibit. If gene flow
among different gerbil populations is restricted, then
such morphological traits important to a species' interaction in an ecosystem may become geographically structured, so local populations will only contain a subset of

the traits exhibited within a species [44], or be constrained in the extent to which they express certain traits.
Exploring such geographically structured traits can reveal
the extent to which local populations are non-interchangeable due to their distinct adaptations. To test if the
morphological traits characterizing G. henleyi and G. a.
allenbyi are geographically structured, we analyzed the
log-transformed measurements of their hind foot length,
tail length, and body mass using a multivariate analysis of
variance (i.e. MANOVA) followed by univariate tests (i.e.
ANOVAs), both conducted using SYSTAT v.11.

sites, 29 of which were parsimony-informative. A total of
16 haplotypes were identified, and nucleotide diversity
(Pi) was 2.1%. The CO2 region in G. henleyi (N = 61) contained 52 polymorphic sites, 37 of which were parsimony-informative. A total of 25 haplotypes were
identified, and nucleotide diversity was 0.8%. G. henleyi's
concatenated sequence of CR and CO2 (N = 60) contained 82 polymorphic sites, 66 of which were parsimony-informative. A total of 34 haplotypes were
identified, and nucleotide diversity was 1.1%. The CR
sequence in G. a. allenbyi (N = 141) contained no variable
sites. The CO2 region in G. a. allenbyi (N = 69) contained
29 polymorphic sites, 21 of which were parsimony-informative. A total of 25 haplotypes were identified, and
nucleotide diversity was 0.3%. These diversity levels are
low for all the sequences, and as such, the number of
polymorphic sites and nucleotide diversity per sampling
location are correspondingly low (Table 2). In G. henleyi,
the CO1 sequence contained nine synonymous substitutions. One non-synonymous substitution (in amino-acid
508) occurred in four individuals from the Agur sands.
The CO2 sequence contained 23 synonymous substitutions. Five non-synonymous substitutions occurred in
amino acids 54 (4 individuals from the western sands),
142 (2 individuals from the western sands), 182 (2 individuals from the western sands), 185 (2 individuals from
the western sands), and 191 (3 individuals from the western sands). In G. a. allenbyi, the CO1 sequence contained
six synonymous substitutions. Two non-synonymous
substitutions occurred in amino acids 483 (16 individuals
from the western sands) and 485 (2 individuals from the
western sands). The CO2 sequence contained 12 synonymous substitutions. Three non-synonymous substitutions occurred in amino acids 8 (2 individuals from

Results
The results of our sampling efforts depended on the species and location sampled (Table 1). While G. a. allenbyi
individuals were relatively easy to catch, specimens of G.
henleyi were much harder to trap, which forced us to use
smaller sample sizes. The same partial length (335 bp) of
the control region (CR) was sequenced for all individuals.
The CO2 sequence contains part of the CO1 gene, the
CO2 gene, and part of the ATPase 8 gene. Because the
entire sequence was too long to achieve high-quality
readouts, we created a chimera sequence by joining the
two ends which were readable. The lengths of the
sequences eventually used were 1009 bp for G. henleyi
and 927 bp for G. a. allenbyi.
No insertions or deletions were present in any of the
sequences. There was a pronounced bias against G in
both CR and CO2 fragments (mean G composition: 8.7%
in G. henleyi CR, 12.8% in G. henleyi CO2, and 13.4% in
G. a. allenbyi CO2). In both species, no stop codons were
detected within the CO1 and CO2 sequences. All these
results support the conclusion that the sequences represent mtDNA and are not nuclear pseudogenes. The CR
sequence in G. henleyi (N = 63) contained 30 variable

some nights only one or two individuals were caught, and on other nights, no individuals were caught at all. Locations in the inner sands are

Mamshit), and 43 (2 individuals from the western sands).
AMOVA results from the analyses of the CR and CO2
sequences (individually and concatenated) in G. henleyi
showed that genetic variation was solely attributed to
within-population differences (100%) (Table 3). Moreover, the global PhiPT values were zero and non-significant, indicating no significant population structure. The
analysis for the CO2 sequence in G. a. allenbyi (recall that
there was no variation in the CR sequence of G. a. allenbyi, therefore concatenating both sequences would have
had no effect on the results) showed that 87% of the
genetic variation occurred within populations and 13%
among populations. The high global PhiPT value (0.133,
p = 0.001) indicates a significant population genetic

structure. The very small (N ≤ 5) sample sizes from Nahal
Secher, Avshalom, and Mishor Rotem led us to combine
the samples from Nahal Secher and Mashabim, Avshalom
and Agur North, and Mishor Rotem and Mishor Yamin
for the AMOVA analysis. Grouping is a potential source
of bias in such analyses. Note that Avshalom and Agur
north are close to each other, as are Mishor Yamin and
Mishor Rotem. Regarding Mashabim and Nahal Secher,
they may seem further away from each other on the map
than the other groupings, but geomorphologically and
botanically, they are considered as locations within a single geographical unit [45]. Furthermore, conducting the
analyses without individuals from these three smallersample locations did not have a qualitative effect on the
results, suggesting that the grouping did not cause bias.

All G. henleyi variation was explained by differences within populations, while 13% of the variation in G. a. allenbyi's CO2 region was explained
by differences among populations. G. a. allenbyi's CR was not analyzed since there was no variance in these sequences.

Low values were obtained from pairwise PhiPT comparisons for the CR and CO2 concatenated sequence and
for each sequence separately in G. henleyi (Table 4, see
Additional file 1). The results for G. a. allenbyi (Table 5),
on the other hand, contain several higher values (>0.2),
indicating a great degree of isolation between populations [46]. The higher values come mostly from comparisons of the population in Mamshit with other
populations, indicating that there is some isolation
between the inner sands and the western Negev sand
dunes. Mantel tests did not show significant correlations
between genetic and geographical distances for any of the
sequences (G. a. allenbyi CO2: p = 0.417; G. henleyi CR: p
= 0.174, CO2: p = 0.381, CR+CO2: p = 0.649).
When examining the haplotype networks (see Additional file 2), the G. a. allenbyi network showed noticeable
haplotype clustering of the CO2 sequences from the
inner sands region. Haplotypes unique to the inner sands
are closely related to a common haplotype which is
shared by individuals from both regions. In the G. henleyi
CR network, no haplotype is unique to the inner sands,
and haplotypes which are found in the inner sands are not
clustered together. In the G. henleyi CO2 and concatenated sequence networks, one haplotype is unique to the
inner sands, showing only a weak connection to the other
inner sands haplotypes.
Neutrality tests resulted in positive values for G. henleyi's CR, non-significant (negative) values for G. henleyi's
CO2 and for the concatenated sequence, and negative
values for G. a. allenbyi's CO2 sequence (Table 6). Negative values of these indices indicate a recent population
expansion, while positive values indicate some other
demographic force at work, such as a recent or historical
bottleneck. The mismatch distribution analysis for G.
henleyi's CR and CO2 combined sequence (Figure 2a)
shows a ragged distribution (r = 0.005, p = N.S.), indicative of a population which has been stable in size for a
long period of time. The analysis of G. a. allenbyi's CO2
(Figure 2b) shows a wave-like distribution (r = 0.028, p =
0.056), possibly indicative of a recent population expansion. The peaks in the graph are a result of the analysis

being conducted on the entire dataset, which includes
populations which are highly differentiated. A smoother
pattern is evident when the western Negev populations
are analyzed separately. The segregating sites analyses
(Figure 2c, d) both show an excess of new mutations compared to the amount expected by a neutral model. G. henleyi's analysis shows an excess of older mutations
(mutations shared by many individuals; see Additional
file 3).
The approximate time since expansion can be estimated by the formula t = τ /2u [37]; t = time in years, τ =
peak number of mismatches accumulated in mutational
time since expansion where this time is measured in units
of generations divided by 2u, and u = mutation rate per
nucleotide site per generation multiplied by the number
of nucleotides compared (in this case 1262 bp for G. a.
allenbyi). τ was estimated at 1.59 from the mismatch distributions. This translates to an initiation of expansion of
G. a. allenbyi about 23000-32000 years BP if we assume a
generation interval of one year (G. a. allenbyi's survivorship in nature is usually one year, during which it reproduces once) and a substitution rate of 19.4-27.4 × 10-9
per nucleotide site, and year as previously estimated for
the control region and protein-coding regions of mammalian mtDNA [42]. This date should be regarded as preliminary owing to the small size of the analyzed sequence
and rough estimation of the gene's mutation rate.
To investigate the behaviour of the Bayesian skyline
plot model, we analyzed the sequence data of both species using BEAST. Sequences were simulated down the
tree using the general time-reversible (GTR) model, while
also allowing for a heterogeneous (four-category gamma
distribution) mutation rate among sites. The number of
groups (m) was set to 20 for G. henleyi, and 5 for G. a.
allenbyi. The results are summarized in a Bayesian skyline plot (Figure 3). The G. henleyi model shows a steady
increase in population size over ~150,000 years, followed
by a sudden decrease, reaching a minimal population size
~6000 BP. These results are consistent with the mismatch
distribution analysis, implying a bottleneck for G. henleyi.
The G. a. allenbyi model shows an increase of ~500% in

Probability values based on 999 permutations are above the diagonal and PhiPT values are below the diagonal. Higher values (≥0.2) show
that populations of this species exhibit a great degree of differentiation, especially between populations from Mamshit and from the western
sands. Inner sands locations are indicated in italics.

strengthening the conclusion that this species has undergone a recent population expansion.
The proportion of polymorphic sites exhibiting a significant, non-random association was 117/406 (28.82%) for
G. henleyi CR, 169/528 (32.01%) for G. henleyi CO2, 501/
1891 (26.49%) for G. henleyi concatenated sequence and
26/210 (12.38%) for G. a. allenbyi CO2 [After Bonferroni
correction: 53/406 (13.05%), 80/528 (15.15%), 175/1891
(9.25%) and 6/210 (2.86%), respectively]. These relatively
low values indicate no significant association between
different mutations in the examined sequences.
No significant differences in body size were detected
between male and female G. henleyi (MANOVA, Wilks'
Lambda = 0.884; F3,40 = 1.755; p = 0.171; Figure 3a, b, c).
Population-of-origin also had no significant effect on
body size (MANOVA: Wilks' Lambda = 0.696; F12,106 =
1.300; p = 0.229), but there were significant differences
(F4,42 = 3.130; p = 0.024) in body mass between populations. No significant differences were found between
regions, i.e. western vs. inner sands (MANOVA: Wilks'
Lambda = 0.989; F3,48 = 0.178; p = 0.911). The interaction
between population and sex was not significant
(MANOVA: Wilks' Lambda = 0.795; F12,106 = 0.799; p =
0.651).
Because only female G. a. allenbyi individuals were
caught in Nahal Secher (Figure 4d, e, f), its sample was

not used for the analysis. MANOVA found significant
(Wilks' Lambda = 0.888; F3,117 = 4.938; p = 0.003) differences between the sexes. Sex had a significant effect
(F1,119 = 6.730; p = 0.011) on tail length (males have longer
tails than females) but not on foot length (F1,119 = 1.335; p
= 0.250) or body mass (F1,119 = 0.031; p = 0.861). There
were significant differences in body size between populations (MANOVA: Wilks' Lambda = 0.606, F18,331 = 3.572,
p < 0.001; Univariate tests: F6,119 = 4.109, p = 0.001 for tail
length, F6,119 = 5.535, p < 0.001 for body mass, and F6,119 =
2.082, p = 0.060 for foot length). Individuals from the
western Negev were found to be larger (Wilks' Lambda =
0.931; F3,129 = 3.192; p = 0.026). No significant interaction
was found between sex and population-of-origin (Wilks'
Lambda = 0.832; F18,331 = 1.236; p = 0.230).

Discussion
The purpose of this research was to demonstrate the
importance of adopting a comparative approach in population and conservation genetic studies. To elucidate the
links between the genetic make-up, phenotypic variation,
and type of rarity characterizing G. henleyi, we compared
its population genetic structure with that of G. a. allenbyi. Specifically, we compared the genetic structures and
demographic histories of common and rare species in
their continuous ranges and in isolated populations,

ragged pattern in the pairwise differences graph in G. henleyi indicates that this species has maintained a stable population size over a long period of
time. The wave-like pattern in the G. a. allenbyi graph, however, indicates that this species underwent a recent population expansion. The allelic frequency graphs indicate that older mutations (mutations that are shared by many individuals) predominate in G. henleyi and, consistent with a recent
population expansion, relatively new mutations predominate in G. a. allenbyi.

while investigating a possible association between rarity
and increased genetic differentiation.
Previous research has indicated that G. henleyi is considered rare wherever it is found [14,18]. In our study, G.
henleyi was indeed found to be the rarer species-it

occurred in lower numbers than G. a. allenbyi, and the
sampling effort required to collect reasonable sample
sizes was much higher. Gerbillus henleyi's rarity is signified by widespread global distribution, low habitat specificity, and small population size. Examining worldwide

concatenated CR+CO2 sequences of G. henleyi (a) and G. a. allenbyi (b). The x-axis is in units of years before present, and the y-axis is
equal to Neτ (the product of the effective population size and the generation length in years). The thick solid line is the median estimate, and
the dashed lines show the 95% highest posterior density (HPD) interval. Sequences were simulated down the tree using the general timereversible (GTR) model and empirical base frequencies, while also allowing for a heterogeneous (four-category gamma distribution) mutation rate among sites. The number of groups (m) was set to 20 for G.
henleyi, and 5 for G. a. allenbyi. MCMC chains were run for 10,000,000 iterations of which the first 10% were discarded to allow for burn-in. Genealogies and model parameters were sampled every 1,000 iterations.
Utilizing a strict molecular clock model, evolutionary rate was expressed in mutations per site per year, assuming it is normally distributed with a mean equal to 27.4 × 10-9 [42], and a standard deviation of
10 × 10-9.

rarity of mammals, Yu and Dobson [5] showed that only
3/255 of the rodents they examined (1.17% and 4.78% of
mammals across all orders) possessed this type of rarity.
The level of genetic diversity, for all samples, was generally low for both species and for both sequences, culminating in the CR of G. a. allenbyi, which showed no
variation whatsoever. This result was unexpected, since
CR sequences are normally the most variable regions in
mtDNA [47]. For example, a study examining the entire
CR of red-backed voles [48] found that between 12% and
40% of the nucleotide positions were variable, depending
on their locations within the CR. However, results such as
ours are not unheard of-a study of introduced Rattus rattus in Madagascar [49] found 2.6% variable sites, a value
which is also considered very low, in an analysis done on
part of the control region. Furthermore, in a recent study
examining mutation rates throughout the mtDNA of
mice [50], a very low mutation rate was observed for the
CR. A mechanism to explain this observation remains
elusive.
The source of all the molecular variance in G. henleyi
was found to be differences within rather than among
populations. All pairwise comparisons produced low
PhiPT values for analyses of the CR and CO2 sequences.
In conclusion, the genetic structure analysis suggested
that G. henleyi populations are not isolated, thus supporting the hypothesis that this species is evenly distributed
throughout its geographical range, possibly owing both to
its ability to utilize several habitat types and to its high
mobility [12]. The lack of differentiation between the
inner sands and western Negev populations of G. henleyi
may indicate that this species has adopted a nomadic
strategy to compensate for its small population size [e.g.
[51]]. However, this explanation should be more thoroughly examined, because such small animals are usually
not known to travel such long distances as those that exist
between the inner sands and western Negev sands. In
addition, it does not explain why the overall genetic
diversity is lower than expected for a neutral population.
In the CO2 region of G. a. allenbyi, differences among
populations accounted for 13% of the molecular variance,
while 87% of the variance was accounted for by differences within populations (since no variation was found in
the CR sequence of G. a. allenbyi, the exact same results
were obtained when analyzing the concatenated
sequence). PhiPT values for this species were much
higher than for G. henleyi, and the highest values were
obtained from comparisons of inner sands populations
(especially Mamshit) with those of the western Negev,
and also from the comparison of Mamshit and Mishor
Yamin, both of which are located in the inner sands. The
western Negev populations show relatively little to moderate levels of isolation from each other. However, the

comparison of the Mifrasit and Mashabim populations
gives a high PhiPT value of 0.2, indicating the potential
for a high degree of isolation between populations even
within the western sands. Other noteworthy moderate
PhiPT values are those for Mishor Yamin and Mamshit
vs. Agur South. Mishor Yamin and Mamshit are both part
of the inner sands (thus rendering the relatively high
degree of isolation between them surprising), and no
sandy connection exists between these sands and the
dunes of the western Negev more than 40 km west.
Therefore, comparisons of the Mamshit and western
Negev populations produce high PhiPT values. Why
comparisons of Agur South with inner sands populations
should be different in this respect remains unclear. One
possibility is that individual G. a. allenbyi were transported by humans between Agur South and the inner
sands at some point in the last few decades, a scenario
that is supported by a study from 1957 [13], which found
no G. a. allenbyi in the inner sands, and by the first
announcement of their presence in Mishor Rotem only
three decades later [14]. If this species only recently
arrived to the inner sands, then it is indeed possible that
these populations still resemble their source population
even though they are, in fact, isolated. This explanation,
however, is problematic because the degree of mtDNA
divergence found between the Mamshit and the western
Negev populations is not likely to have arisen over such a
short period of time.
Three theoretical scenarios offer explanations for
exceedingly low levels of genetic diversity and differentiation: a) selective sweep - a new mutation spreads out
through positive selection, other genes hitchhike; should
lead to strong linkage between polymorphic sites; b)
background selection - purifying selection on a certain
gene weeds out genetic variants, a process that is recognizable by the low accumulation of neutral mutations and
low linkage disequilibrium (For example, this was the
case with the protein-coding sequence CO2); and c)
founder effect, or a rapid population expansion after a
bottleneck, is characterized by low linkage disequilibrium. All three of these scenarios may help explain low
genetic differentiation even without gene flow between
the populations. Only the first and second scenarios are
mutually exclusive.
In G. henleyi, two of the CR neutrality indices were positive, indicating an excess of older mutations, i.e. the
entire population developed from a limited number of
ancestors, but that population is still in a bottleneck
(Note that this pattern was not evident when analyzing
only the CO2 region, nor when analyzing the concatenated sequence). All the indices were negative for G. a.
allenbyi, suggesting that this species underwent a recent
population expansion. The low values detected by linkage
disequilibrium tests for both species rule out the possibil-

Page 12 of 14

ity of a selective sweep in either case. Both the ragged
pattern produced by the pairwise-distribution analysis of
G. henleyi and the Bayesian skyline plot indicate that its
small population has not grown in many years. Similarly,
the analysis of segregating sites indicated the existence of
numerous old mutations that imply the presence of a limited number of common ancestors, which together attest
to a more genetically variable past and suggest that the
population experienced a bottleneck at some point. The
experimental pattern of G. a. allenbyi resembled the
wave-like pattern expected for a population that has
undergone a historic change in population size. The segregating sites analysis revealed multiple new mutations-a
pattern also indicative of a recent population expansion
(which initiated at ~23,000-32,000 BP). Furthermore, the
G. a. allenbyi Bayesian skyline plot showed an increase of
~500% in population size between 10,000-30,000 BP, further strengthening the conclusion that this species has
undergone a recent population expansion. Aeolian sand
became geologically significant in the western Negev
around 25,000-30,000 BP. Sand dunes in considerable
amounts are dated to 18,000-10,000 BP [45,52] and this
agrees with the paleontological data used to evaluate this
species' expansion in the Levant [53]. We interpret this to
mean that the expansion of G. a. allenbyi coincided with
the incursion of sands from the Nile Delta during the
upper quaternary. Our expansion calculation should be
regarded as preliminary due to the small size of the analyzed sequence and rough estimation of the gene's mutation rate.
Our analyses revealed some unequivocal differences
between G. henleyi and G. a. allenbyi. Existing in small
populations characterized by low levels of genetic diversity and differentiation, G. henleyi appears to be in the
midst of a population bottleneck. Although the reasons
for this bottleneck are not clear, a possible explanation
may rest on this species' inferior ability to compete with
more common and stronger gerbil species such as G. pyramidum and G. a. allenbyi [20]. The rare status of G. henleyi may affect its overall genetic diversity, but it does not
seem to be affecting the amount of genetic differentiation
between its populations. G. a. allenbyi is a larger, stronger, more common species, and the reasons for its low
genetic diversity, especially in the control region, remain
unclear. Populations of G. a. allenbyi were shown to be
more isolated than those of G. henleyi, the most feasible
explanation of which could be G. a. allenbyi's higher habitat specificity.
Our genetic analyses are based on mtDNA data, which
is haploid and maternally inherited. This is a widely used
marker, although it may suffer from bias due to sex-specific dispersal patterns. Clearly, further research should
be done in order to explore the extent to which patterns
which arise from the mtDNA analysis conform to those

Rotkopf et al. BMC Ecology 2010, 10:15
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/10/15

arising from other genetic markers screening the nuclear
genome as well, such as microsatellites or AFLP.
To test if different gerbil populations exhibit phenotypic divergence, we conducted morphometric analyses.
Exploring geographically structured traits can reveal the
extent to which local populations are non-interchangeable due to their distinct adaptations. No sexual size
dimorphism was found in G. henleyi, but body mass varied significantly among populations. Regarding G. a.
allenbyi, males were larger and had longer tails than
females. This agrees with previous work on this species
[22,54] which found that the mean body mass of males is
higher than that of females. There were also clear phenotypic variations-e.g. foot length, tail length, and body
mass differed significantly among G. a. allenbyi populations, and in a comparison between regions, individuals
from the western sands were found to be larger than individuals from the inner sands. In a previous study [54],
location also significantly affected body mass. However,
body mass may be a problematic variable from which to
infer genetic differences between populations-animals
collected by Wahrman and Gourevitz [55] showed no significant differences in body mass between locations, after
exposure to laboratory conditions for 2-4 weeks. Thus, it
may be concluded that the differences in body mass
between locations probably reflect a response to different
environmental conditions, and have no or little genetic
basis [54].

Conclusions
Our findings indicate that G. henleyi's type of rarity may
be explained by two factors that are not mutually exclusive-high mobility rates, which decrease the level of
divergence between populations, and an ongoing bottleneck, which lowers both the overall and within-population genetic diversity. It is important to note that the high
mobility rates of G. henleyi are inferred from its high level
of individual turnover [12]; we do not have direct data on
this species' ability to traverse long distances. However, it
seems unreasonable to assume that an isolated population of so few individuals can survive for such a long time
devoid of contact with other populations of conspecifics.
The comparison between G. a. allenbyi and G. henleyi
surprisingly revealed that the more common species
exhibited higher levels of divergence between populations than the rare species. This may indicate that habitat
specificity (which is stronger in G. a. allenbyi) plays a
more important role than the degree of rarity in determining a species' genetic variation. We suggest that
adopting a comparative approach as presented here could
largely improve our understanding of the causes and
effects of rarity. Such an understanding should enable us
to better protect ecosystem integrity and prevent biodiversity loss.

sequences. The low values indicate low levels of differentiation between
populations. Probability values based on 999 permutations are above the
diagonal and PhiPT values are below the diagonal. Note that Mamshit (indicated in italics) is the only location from the inner sands.
Additional file 2 Haplotype networks of the four sequences (G. a.
allenbyi CO2, G. henleyi CO2, CR and concatenated sequence). The networks describe the distances between haplotypes for the three sequences.
Circle sizes are proportional to the number of individuals with a certain
haplotype. Yellow areas represent individuals from the western Negev
sands; brown areas represent individuals from the inner sands. Red circles
represent theoretical intermediate haplotypes. The number of mutations is
represented by ticks on the lines; a clean line indicates one mutation. In the
G. a. allenbyi network, there appear haplotypes which are unique to the
inner sands, and are clustered close to a common haplotype which is
shared by both regions. In the G. henleyi CR network, there appear no haplotypes which are unique to the inner sands, and no clustering is evident. In
the CO2 and concatenated sequence network, one haplotype is unique to
the inner sands, but it shows no clear connection to the other inner sands
haplotypes.
Additional file 3 Pairwise differences and allelic frequency graphs for
G. henleyi's CR (a, c) and CO2 (b, d). The ragged pattern in the pairwise
differences graphs for both sequences in G. henleyi indicates that this species has maintained a stable population size over a long period of time. The
allelic frequency graphs indicate that older mutations (mutations that are
shared by many individuals) predominate in G. henleyi, suggesting that this
species has experienced a bottleneck.
