Abstract
Background: The true water bugs are grouped in infraorder Nepomorpha (Insecta: Hemiptera:
Heteroptera) and are of great economic importance. The phylogenetic relationships within
Nepomorpha and the taxonomic hierarchies of Pleoidea and Aphelocheiroidea are uncertain. Most
of the previous studies were based on morphological characters without algorithmic assessment.
In the latest study, the molecular markers employed in phylogenetic analyses were partial
sequences of 16S rDNA and 18S rDNA with a total length about 1 kb. Up to now, no mitochondrial
genome of the true water bugs has been sequenced, which is one of the largest data sets that could
be compared across animal taxa. In this study we analyzed the unresolved problems in
Nepomorpha using evidence from mitochondrial genomes.
Results: Nine mitochondrial genomes of Nepomorpha and five of other hemipterans were
sequenced. These mitochondrial genomes contain the commonly found 37 genes without gene
rearrangements. Based on the nucleotide sequences of mt-genomes, Pleoidea is not a member of
the Nepomorpha and Aphelocheiroidea should be grouped back into Naucoroidea. Phylogenetic
relationships among the superfamilies of Nepomorpha were resolved robustly.
Conclusion: The mt-genome is an effective data source for resolving intraordinal phylogenetic
problems at the superfamily level within Heteroptera. The mitochondrial genomes of the true
water bugs are typical insect mt-genomes. Based on the nucleotide sequences of the mt-genomes,
we propose the Pleoidea to be a separate heteropteran infraorder. The infraorder Nepomorpha
consists of five superfamilies with the relationships (Corixoidea + ((Naucoroidea + Notonectoidea)
+ (Ochteroidea + Nepoidea))).

Background
The true water bugs are grouped as the infraorder Nepomorpha, one of seven infraorders within the suborder

Heteroptera (Insecta: Hemiptera) [1]. This group is of tremendous economic importance because all the members,
except some Corixidae, are predators [2]. Extant water

bugs have been grouped into 6 [3,4] or 5 superfamilies
(Notonectoidea including Pleoidea) [2]. When molecular
sequence data was combined with morphological characters to analyze the phylogenetic relationships of the true
water bugs for the first time, a 7-superfamily classification
system was proposed, containing a newly erected superfamily Aphelocheiroidea, which had formerly belonged
to Naucoroidea (Table 1) [5].
In these classification systems, the contents of Nepoidea,
Corixoidea, and Ochteroidea are constant. Phylogenetic
relationships proposed previously at the superfamily or
family level within Nepomorpha are summarized in Figure 1. The works of China (1955) [6], Popov (1971) [7],
Rieger (1976) [8], and Mahner (1993) [3] were based on
morphological characters without algorithmic analysis. In
their landmark work, Hebsgaard et al. (2004) reviewed
these studies in detail and analyzed the phylogeny of Nepomorpha using molecular sequence data (partial
sequence of 16S rDNA and 28S rDNA) combined with
morphological data for the first time, raising a new superfamily Aphelocheiroidea as part of a new phylogenetic
hypothesis (Figure 1E) [5].
Until now, the monophyly of each nepomorphan family,
and the monophyly of superfamilies Nepoidea, Corixoidea, and Ochteroidea in Nepomorpha, have been generally accepted [3,5-8]. A close relationship between Pleidae
and Helotrephidae has been supported by recent studies
[3,5,7,8] and the monophyly of Aphelocheiridae + Potamocoridae was supported in the latest comprehensive
study [5]. The phylogenetic relationships within Nepomorpha, however, have not reached full agreement. The
unsolved problems are: 1) whether the Aphelocheiridae
and Potamocoridae should be members of Naucoroidea
or be raised as a separate superfamily Aphelocheiroidea;
2). whether the Pleidae and Helotrephidae should be

members of Notonectoidea or be raised as a separate
superfamily Pleoidea; 3) the phylogenetic relationships
among the superfamilies.
The mitochondrial genome (mt-genome) is one of the
largest sets of homologous genes which can be compared
across animal taxa and has become an effective data
source for resolving deep-level phylogenetic problems
[9,10]. Within Insecta, more than one hundred mtgenomes are available now in GenBank/DDBJ/EMBL and
mt-genomes have been shown to resolve intraordinal relationships, such as in Diptera [11], Hymenoptera [12], and
Orthoptera [13]. There are many possible ways of using
mt-genomes in phylogenetic analyses, for example by
using different genes, amino acid sequences or nucleotide
sequences. Using the nucleotide sequences of all available
genes clearly has been shown to be the best way to extract
a phylogenetic signal from mt-genomes [11,13].
Previous molecular data used for the analysis of nepomorphan relationships was about 1 kb [5] and no mt-genome
data are available for any nepomorphan species. In this
study, fourteen new mt-genomes were sequenced, nine of
them belonging to the infraorder Nepomorpha (Table 2)
(one mt-genome from our previous paper was also
included in Table 2[14]). A preliminary phylogenetic
framework of Nepomorpha is proposed using mt-genome
data, and the relationships of Pleoidea and Aphelocheiroidea are analyzed.

genomes are similar to the typical insect mt-genomes,
containing the commonly found 37 genes in the same
gene order as observed in Drosophila yakuba [GenBank:
NC001322] [15]. No gene rearrangement or duplication
has been found, indicating that the organizations of the
mt-genomes in the suborder Heteroptera are more stable
than those in the suborder Sternorrhyncha (Insecta:
Hemiptera) [16]. Family names are used instead of the
species names in following discussion for brevity since
only a single representative was selected for each family.
Ten completely sequenced mt-genomes range in length
from 15130 bp (Pleidae) to 16079 bp (Gelastocoridae).
Lengths of the 37 coding genes of each mt-genome range
from 14372 bp (Fulgoridae) to 14637 bp (Notonectidae),
while the size of the control regions ranges from 608 bp
(Pleidae) to 1450 bp (Gelastocoridae) (Table 3). Variance
of the mt-genome size is mainly derived from the control
region.

Nucleotide compositions of these mt-genomes are ATbiased (Table 3). Though the control regions of four mtgenomes were not completely sequenced, this biased
trend is obvious even without the control region
sequence. Interestingly, in most of the completely
sequenced mt-genomes, the control regions are not the
most AT-rich regions (Table 3), which has been found in
other insect mt-genomes [15,17]
Intergenic spacers ranging from 14 bp (Corixidae) to 23
bp (Reduviidae) were found between tRNA-Ser(UCN)
and ND1 in all mt-genomes except Fulgoridae. This spacer
has also been reported in other insects and some conserved motifs were identified [18-20]. In the present
study, no perfectly conserved motif was found but a conserved region was identified (see additional file 1). Additionally, a unique 222 bp intergenic spacer was found
between tRNA-Gly and ND3 in Hydrometridae which
lacks significant BLAST similarity (megablast in nuclePage 4 of 11

otide collection). The exact origin and function of such
spacers are unclear, but they may be the vestiges of pseudogenes generated by the gene duplication-random loss
process of rearrangement [21]

this clade was found to be a sister group of Notonectoidea
(Notonectidae) plus Naucoroidea (Naucoridae and Aphelocheiridae).

Discussion
Other features of these mt-genomes, including non-traditional start codons such as TTG of CO1 in Naucoridae and
GTG of ND1 in Aphelocheiridae, incomplete stop codons
T or TA, and absence of the DHU arm in the secondary
structure of tRNA-Ser(GCU), are found commonly in
insect mt-genomes [15,18,20,22-24].
Phylogenetic analyses
For the fifteen species, there are 14968 sites in the
PCG123RT matrix (containing all three codon positions
for protein coding genes (PCGs), plus the whole of the
rRNA and tRNA genes), 11236 sites in the PCG12RT
matrix (containing the first and the second codon positions of PCGs, plus the whole of the rRNA and tRNA
genes), 11196 sites in the PCG123 matrix (containing all
three codon positions of PCGs), and 7464 sites in the
PCG12 matrix (containing the first and the second codon
positions of PCGs). From Bayesian and ML inferences,
these four matrices generated eight fully bifurcated trees
with similar topology (Figure 2, Figure 3). The monophyletic Nepoidea and Ochteroidea were consistently
recovered. The monophyly of the remaining nepomorphan superfamilies such as Pleoidea, Corixoidea, Notonectoidea, Naucoroidea, and Aphelocheiroidea could not
be analyzed in this study as only a single representative
was sampled. In all trees, the relationships within Nepomorpha were found to be constant. The Pleoidea (Pleidae) was recognized as the sister group of the clade
including the infraorders Cimicomorpha (Reduviidae),
Leptopodomorpha (Leptopodidae), Pentatomomorpha
(Rhopalidae), and the remaining traditional Nepomorpha. Nepoidea and Ochteroidea were sister groups and

Mitochondrial genomes
The mt-genomes sequenced in this study are similar to the
mt-genomes of other insects and contain very few novel
features (see additional file 2 for the descriptions of these
mt-genomes). It has been reported that the hemipteroid
insects (including Hemiptera, Thysanoptera, Psocoptera,
and Phthiraptera) have experienced increased rates of mtgenomic gene rearrangements [16,25-29]. Gene content
and gene order of the mt-genomes sequenced in this
study, however, are all the same as observed in Drosophila
yakuba [GenBank: NC001322) [15] except for some
unique intergenic spacers. In the present study, gene order
provides no phylogenetic information.
Phylogenetic analyses
Mt-genomes provide abundant phylogenetic signal
because they possess large sets of homologous genes. Multiple genes with increased sequence lengths are favorable
for accurate phylogenetic analyses [30-32]. It has been
shown that the best way to use mt-genomes in phylogenetic analyses is to combine all the coding genes and use
nucleotide sequence data [13]. We used a data set consisting of all 37 genes (PCG123RT data set) to infer relationships within Nepomorpha. The PCG12RT, PCG123, and
PCG12 data sets were analyzed to test the stability of the
phylogenetic hypotheses to the inclusion of different portions of the data. Phylogenetic relationships among heteropteran infraorders are still controversial [33-36]. Taxon
sampling for this study is too limited to analyze this problem in full and data for the infraorders Enicocephalomorpha and Dipsocoromorpha are not yet available. We
focused on the phylogeny within infraorder Nepomor-

pha, especially relationships among superfamilies, using
mt-genome sequences for the first time. Finally, five of the
eight analyses inferred the same topology, with the
remaining three tree resulting form less complete datasets
(nucleotide substitution saturation analysis was also
added in additional file 3) differing at a few nodes, which
indicates that the mt-genome is an effective data source
for resolving phylogenetic problems within Nepomorpha
at the superfamily level. Because the ML and Bayesian
algorithms are not sensitive to possible long-branch
attraction and allow evolutionary modeling of the data
[37-39], we do not think our hypotheses are artifacts.
The Problem of Pleoidea
The Pleoidea has been proposed to include Pleidae and
Helotrephidae [3,5]. The mt-genome of Helotrephidae
was not sequenced in this study. This family has been generally accepted as the sister group of Pleidae [3,5,7,8]
except in the study of China (1955) [6].

Previous studies based on morphological characters,
molecular data or combined data consistently support a
monophyletic Nepomorpha [3,5-8]. In this study, however, a monophyletic Nepomorpha is supported by one
analysis of the eight performed. In all previous studies,
Pleoidea is the sister group of Notonectoidea [3,5,7,8]
and has always been included in Notonectoidea [2]. A surprising, but strongly supported result from the mtgenome analysis was that Pleoidea is not part of Nepomorpha, but rather the sister group of the clade including
Nepomorpha, Leptopodomorpha, Cimicomorpha, and
Pentatomomorpha (Figure 2, Figure 3).
Based on these results we propose that the Pleoidea could
be raised from a superfamily to the infraorder Plemorpha,
and that the infraorder Nepomorpha consists of the
remaining nepomorphans except Pleoidea. The phylogenetic position of the infraorder Plemorpha within suborder Heteroptera needs further study because mt-genome
data from infraorders Enicocephalomorpha and Dipsocoromorpha are unavailable at the present time.
The Problem of Aphelocheiroidea
The recently proposed superfamily Aphelocheiroidea
(including Aphelocheiridae and Potamocoridae) [5],
which was considered as part of Naucoroidea by other
researchers [2,3], was proposed to be the sister group of a
clade consisting of Ochteroidea, Notonectoidea, and Naucoroidea [5]. In the present analysis, Aphelocheiridae and
Naucoridae consistently formed a monophyletic clade
with high data support (Figure 2, Figure 3). Although the
mt-genome of Potamocoridae was not sequenced in this
study, this family has been suggested to be the sister group
of Aphelocheiridae [5], Naucoridae [8], Naucoridae +
Aphelocheiridae [7], a subfamily within Naucoridae [6],
or unresolved by Mahner (1993) [3]. Here we propose

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/134

that the Aphelocheiroidea raised by Hebsgaard et al.
(2004) [5] should be grouped within Naucoroidea again.
Phylogeny of "Nepomorpha"
The traditional infraorder Nepomorpha is not monophyletic and it should only contain Corixoidea, Nepoidea, Ochteroidea, Notonectoidea, and Naucoroidea. The
superfamilies Nepoidea (including Nepidae and Belostomatidae) and Ochteroidea (including Ochteridae and
Gelastocoridae) are monophyletic and sister-groups in all
trees with high support, as is generally accepted [3,5-8].
Nepoidea has been considered as the most basal branch of
Nepomorpha in previous studies [3,5,7,8]. The position
of Ochteroidea varied between previous researchers [3,58]. Because of the novel position inferred for Pleoidea, the
sister-group relationship between Pleoidea and Notonectoidea which has been consistently proposed [3,5-8] was
not supported and Notonectoidea was inferred to be the
sister group of Naucoroidea.

The placement of Corixoidea is very different from previous hypotheses. Traditionally, this superfamily was
placed as the sister group of a clade composed of Naucoroidea, Ochteroidea, and Notonectoidea [3,5,7] or the
sister group of a clade composed of Naucoroidea and
Notonectoidea [6,8]. In our results, Corixoidea is always
the most basal clade within Nepomorpha, with Naucoroidea, Notonectoidea, Ochteroidea, and Nepoidea forming
a monophyletic group.
Furthermore, Lycorma delicatula (Insecta: Hemiptera:
Archaeorrhyncha) was removed from the data sets and the
phylogeny was re-analyzed with the same methods. Same
position of Pleoidea and phylogenetic hypotheses within
Nepomorpha could be drawn (see additional file 4).
Finally, the infraorder Nepomorpha should consist of five
superfamilies with the phylogenetic hypothesis of (Corixoidea + ((Naucoroidea + Notonectoidea) + (Ochteroidea
+ Nepoidea))).

Conclusion
Although previous studies based on morphological characters alone or combined with DNA sequence no longer than
1 kb confirmed the monophyly of Nepomorpha, the phylogenetic inference with the evidence from mitochondrial
genomes in this study supports the raise of a separate
infraorder Plemorpha which belonged to Nepomorpha
before. The well-resolved nepomorphan phylogenetic relationships at superfamily level allow a better understanding
of evolutionary patterns within this group and provide a
robust framework for comparative studies of nepomorphans. The present study demonstrates the great effectiveness of mitochondrial genome for inferring phylogenetic
relationships at superfamily level. Furthermore, this study
also suggests the need of using multiple genes for future phylogenetic analyses of highly debated phylogenies.

Methods
According to the seven-superfamily system of Nepomorpha proposed by Hebsgaard et al. (2004) [5], the representatives of each superfamily were selected (Table 2).
Representatives of the infraorders Gerromorpha, Leptopodomorpha, Cimicomorpha and Pentatomomorpha
were also included (Table 2). A representative of the suborder Archaeorrhyncha (Insecta: Hemiptera), Lycorma delicatula (White), was chosen to root the trees.
A single individual of each species was preserved in 95%
ethanol at -20°C and total genomic DNA was extracted
using the method based on CTAB [40]. PCRs were performed with TaKaRa LA PCR Kit Ver.2.1 following the
manufacturer's recommendations. The primers are listed
in additional file 5. PCR products were electrophoresed in
0.7% agarose gel, purified, and then both strands were
sequenced with primer walking by Beijing Sunbiotech Co.
Ltd.
The complete sequences of each gene were used for phylogenetic analysis (excluding stop codons of the PCGs). All
PCGs were aligned based on amino acid sequence alignments in MEGA version 4.0 [41]. The rRNAs and the
tRNAs were aligned with CLUSTAL X version 1.83 [42]
under the default settings. Ambiguously aligned regions
of PCGs and rRNA genes were carefully adjusted by hand.
Transfer RNA alignments were corrected according to secondary structure. The aligned sequences were concatenated as four matrices used in phylogenetic analyses: 1)
The PCG123RT matrix, including all three codon positions of PCGs, rRNA genes, and tRNA genes; 2) the
PCG12RT matrix, including the first and the second
codon positions of PCGs, rRNA genes, and tRNA genes; 3)
the PCG123 matrix, including all the three codon positions of PCGs; 4) the PCG12 matrix, including the first
and the second codon positions of PCGs.
MrBayes Version 3.1.1 [43] and a PHYML online web
server [44] were employed to reconstruct the phylogenetic
trees under the GTR model. In Bayesian inference, two
simultaneous runs of 3,000,000 generations were conducted for each matrix. Trees inferred prior to stationarity
were discarded as burn-in, and the remaining trees were
used to construct a 50% majority-rule consensus tree. In
ML analysis, the parameters were estimated during analysis and the node support values were assessed by bootstrap resampling (BP) [45] calculated using 100 replicates.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/134

RNA genes were labeled according to the IUPAC-IUB single letter code for the specified amino acid; in cases where
there was more than one tRNA for a particular amino acid,
they were distinguished by their anticodons. PCG: protein
