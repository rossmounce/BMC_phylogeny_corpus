Abstract
Background: Anomalous gene trees (AGTs) are gene trees with a topology different from a
species tree that are more probable to observe than congruent gene trees. In this paper we
propose a rooted triple approach to finding the correct species tree in the presence of AGTs.
Results: Based on simulated data we show that our method outperforms the extended majority rule
consensus strategy, while still resolving the species tree. Applying both methods to a metazoan data
set of 216 genes, we tested whether AGTs substantially interfere with the reconstruction of the
metazoan phylogeny.
Conclusion: Evidence of AGTs was not found in this data set, suggesting that erroneously
reconstructed gene trees are the most significant challenge in the reconstruction of phylogenetic
relationships among species with current data. The new method does however rule out the
erroneous reconstruction of deep or poorly resolved splits in the presence of lineage sorting.

Background
How a species relates with one another is of fundamental
importance in evolutionary biology. The reconstruction
of these relationships among species is now a problem frequently approached with biological sequence data [1-4].
Unfortunately this has not necessarily improved the clarity of species relationships and species trees remain a topic
of debate [5]. In many respects the use of molecular data
has meant that significantly more complicated models of
evolution must be considered. Consequently, reconstructing species trees from gene trees has to cope with two
classes of difficulties. One class relates to the problem of
accurate tree reconstruction from biological sequences.
This is due to both the well known Felsenstein zone type
problems [6,7] caused by long branch attraction, and the
limited amount of phylogenetic signal in finite sequences

[8-10]. The second class is comprised by the effects of lineage sorting resulting in a genealogy different from that of
the species [11,12]. Both kinds of problems are known to
gain severity when the length of internal branches in a
species tree becomes small.
The most prominent example where a short internal
branch interferes with the conclusive reconstruction of
genetic relationships between species are humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas [13-15]. However, even in the presence of lineage sorting, for 3 species the most probable
gene tree represents the species tree [16]. Thus, the problem of the evolutionary ancestry of humans, chimpanzees
and gorillas was eventually approached by sampling a
large number of significantly resolved gene trees from different loci and accepting the most frequently observed

topology tree as the species tree [13,17,18]. It is now common practice to reconstruct gene trees from several
genomic loci, e.g., with Maximum Likelihood methods
[19]. The resulting trees are then combined into a bona
fide species tree with one of several consensus methods
[20,21], e.g. the 50% majority consensus (M50%), the
Majority Rule Extended (MRe) [22], or the Relative Majority Consensus [23]. Alternatively, all sequences can be
concatenated first, and then a single tree is reconstructed
that is hoped to reflect the species' evolutionary relationships. The latter approach resembles a consensus method
where a weighted phylogenetic signal is used to estimate
the consensus tree [21,24,25]. Recently, however, it was
shown that with 4 taxa the most probable gene tree does
not necessarily reflect the species tree, if the species tree is
unbalanced [16]. Such anomalous gene trees (AGTs) [16]
can occur since not all tree topologies are equi-probable
under a coalescent model [16,26,27]. This effect becomes
more severe when trees with five or more taxa are considered. [28,29]. AGTs were proven to exist for n-maximal
probable species trees with 5 or more taxa, where a species
topology with n taxa is defined to be n-maximal probable if
its probability under the Yule model [30-32] is maximal.
Consequently, all species trees with 5 or more taxa can
produce AGTs. Therefore, existing majority rule consensus
methods can be statistically inconsistent with a coalescent
model of evolution. Positively misleading results can also
be obtained when sequences are concatenated to arrive at
a consensus tree [33].
A recent example where AGTs potentially interfere with
the reconstruction of the correct species tree is the reconstruction of the metazoan phylogeny. Evidence exists for
radiation events during early metazoan evolution [34].
Accordingly, Felsenstein zone type problems connected to
the proposed radiation events were said to hinder an accurate gene tree, and thus species tree reconstruction [34].
However, the potential effect of AGTs, which are also
likely to arise in phylogenies with long external and short
internal branches was not taken into account.
The correlation between the genealogy of the compared
sequences and that of the corresponding species is usually
modelled by a coalescent process [12,28,29]. The underlying Kingman coalescent model [35,36] is used with two
basic assumptions. At a speciation event (internal node
on the species tree; Figure 1) travelling past to present, the
population splits into two isolated populations. Furthermore, all species (past and present) have a constant population size. Now sampling a number of alleles from
different individuals of a single species and tracing the
genetic lineages backward in time, we have a traditional
Kingman coalescent process with exponential waiting
time between gene coalescent events within a species
[28,35,36]. The rate with which two genetic lineages in a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/118

population coalesce is proportional to 1/θ where θ is a
measure of the effective population size. If we continue to
go backwards in time past the next speciation event,
genetic lineages from the related species are added to the
process (c.f. Figure 1). By that, genetic lineages from species that share this ancestral population can coalesce, giving rise to the gene tree. As θ → 0 a gene tree will have the
same topology as the species tree with probability close to
1 since all genetic lineages in a population will coalesce
before genetic lineages from a different species are added.
However, when θ → ∞ all coalescent events will occur
above the root of the species tree. Therefore, gene trees are
not necessarily correlated to the species tree. In simple
terms, a large θ gives rise to a larger proportion of incongruent gene trees, an effect that has been described as lineage sorting [11,12].
Currently, two general alternatives exist to assess the effect
of AGTs on phylogeny reconstruction. One requires the
addition of more sequences from the same locus for each
species or clade of interest. This approach relies on the fact
that these particular sequences coalesce after the speciation event of interest [37]. It will, therefore, not aid AGTs
caused by divergences deep in the phylogeny since all the
lineages from a particular taxon coalesce with high probability before the divergence of the taxa under study. The
second general approach makes full use of the coalescent
model with the speciation process. A likelihood function
can be derived over a set of gene trees and a species tree
[38]. A Maximum Likelihood or Bayesian method can
then be used to estimate all the trees and other relevant
parameters. This approach seems promising for smaller
data sets [39-41]. However, it carries a number of drawbacks. For example, removing the molecular clock
assumption is not trivial. Furthermore, the population
parameter will likely not be constant in time or across species. The latter problem was addressed in [42] with a Bayesian approach by modelling correlation between gene
trees with a prior rather than with a coalescent model. The
above methods provide a first approach to dealing with
the AGT problem. However, they share the limitation of
becoming computationally prohibitive with the large
numbers of taxa and loci that are considered.
Here we present a new and fast consensus method to
reconstruct a species tree from a set of gene trees that is
insensitive to the AGT problem. Using simulations, we
show that our method outperforms traditional consensus
methods in reconstructing the correct species tree in the
presence of AGTs. Eventually, we apply our program to
assess the potential influence of AGTs on the reconstruction of the metazoan phylogeny.

Results and Discussion
The approach we take to reconstruct a correct species tree
in the presence of AGTs is based on the observation that
rooted three taxa trees do not exhibit AGTs [28,29]. For a
given set of sequence alignments, we first estimate the
individual gene trees using traditional phylogenetic meth-

⎛n⎞
ods. We then extract the ⎜ ⎟ rooted three taxa trees from
⎝3⎠
each gene tree and take the most frequently occurring as
the species triplet tree. The set of rooted triples is then
combined to produce a species tree using the QUARTETPUZZLE heuristic [43]. The details of the method are presented in Section METHODS AND MATERIALS. The main
advantages of the method are that there are no requirements to estimate any coalescent parameters, it is fast,
eliminates AGTs regardless of the coalescent history, and
scales well to larger problems. We refer to this method as
the Triple Construction Method (TCM).

The intention of our simulations is to demonstrate the
performance we might expect from real data. So rather
than using a tree that is artificially in the AGT zone and
comparing results, we use a Yule tree prior [30,32] on species trees and compare performance of the respective
methods over this prior. Other priors are possible, however we believe that the Yule process models speciation
with sufficient accuracy for this study [31,32]. We do not
attempt to measure the tree "distance" from the true tree,
and report only full correct reconstructions. Finally we do
not report M50% consensus results because for the parameters of interest the M50% will not resolve species trees.
Also if the M50% method does resolve species tree both
TCM and MRe will produce identical species trees. Therfore we compare TCM with MRe.
Simulation Results
We first applied our method to simulated data. For all
simulations species trees were generated from a Yule process with a birth rate of 5. Gene trees were then simulated

from the species trees using a coalescent model
[12,28,29]. These gene trees were subsequently used to
reconstruct the species tree with two methods, our TCM
and the Majority Rule extended (MRe) [22]. To check for
correctness of our method, we tested it first on the smallest size species tree where AGTs can exist (4 taxa; data not
shown). We then extended the simulation to 20 taxa, five
different θ-values and 8 data sets ranging from 10 to
10,000 loci in size. The results are shown in Table 1. For
almost all parameters considered TCM performs at least
equal but in most cases better than MRe. With the smallest
θ-value the advantage of TCM over MRe is the least prominent. This is a reflection of the low number of anomalous
gene trees expected with low values of θ. The difference in
performance of the two methods, however, becomes
more obvious with larger θ values. The number of correctly reconstructed species trees with TCM increases with
increasing numbers of genes, while the performance of
MRe does not benefit to the same degree and sees little
improvement with very large numbers of loci. The high
number of genes were chosen to confirm this asymptotic
performance of TCM. This difference in accuracy between
the two methods is the behaviour we would expect in the
presence of AGTs as there is a nonzero probability of the
Yule process generating a species tree that will give rise to
AGTs.
The type of species tree that can give rise to AGTs is also
the type of tree that potentially causes problems with correct gene tree reconstruction. In particular effects that bias
topologies such as long branch attraction may also produce a bias on the derived species tree with different consensus methods. To assess the effect of gene tree
reconstruction errors, we used the simulated gene trees to

generate short (200 nucleotides) simulated alignments.
From theses alignments we inferred the maximum likelihood gene trees, which were subsequently used to reconstruct the species' phylogeny. The results for both
reconstruction methods TCM and MRe are presented in
Table 2. With small sized data sets (10 – 20 loci), incorrectly reconstructed gene trees interfere substantially with
correct species tree reconstruction. However, when the
number of loci increases, the performance recovers
quickly and is only slightly reduced compared to the scenario with no gene tree reconstruction errors. Notably, the
performance of both methods degrades approximately to
the same extent. We therefore conclude that phylogenetic
reconstruction errors in gene trees add a form of unbiased
noise to the species tree reconstruction problem.
Another important parameter to consider during tree
reconstruction is the number of taxa on the tree. Under a
Yule speciation process, larger species trees have an
increased chance of containing sub trees with the required
short branches necessary for AGTs to occur. The results
from simulations with increasing species tree size is
shown in Table 3. The number of genes is 200, 500 and
1000 with θ = 0.1. With small numbers of taxa both methods have similar performance. However, as the number of
taxa increases the performance of TCM clearly outperforms MRe. The accuracy drops for both methods quite
quickly with larger numbers of taxa. Again we note the
increase in performance with larger numbers of loci. This
indicates that even with quite low θ AGTs could still be a
problem with large trees.
Metazoa Data
We then assessed whether AGTs are an issue in the reconstruction of phylogenies from biological sequence data.
The reconstruction of the animal phylogeny was chosen as
an example. We compiled a set of 216 orthologous proteins from 20 metazoan species and yeast. Protein alignments were produced with T-coffee [44] using the default
parameter settings. All gene trees were reconstructed with
phyML [45]. We used the I+Γ JTT model of protein evolution with 4 rate categories, where both the proportion of

It is noted that the nematodes are placed basal to the
arthropods with greater than 50% support. This would
lend support to the hypothesis that animals with a central
body cavity form the monophyletic group of Coelomata
[46,47]. However, it contrasts the wide spread belief that
places nematodes and arthropods in the monophyletic
clade of Ecdysozoa [48,49]. Proponents of the Ecdysozoa
hypothesis claim that the basal position of C. elegans is an
artifact of phylogenetic reconstruction errors due to long
branches and poor taxon sampling. In fact, when inspecting our gene trees, many had very long branches (greater
than one expected substitution per site). Thus, saturation
of the phylogenetic signal is a problem and long branch
attraction cannot be ruled out. However, resolution of this
problem is outside the scope of this paper.

invariant sights and the Γ shape parameter were estimated
from the data.
The species phylogeny derived from the 216 genes with
the yeast outgroup removed and obtained with the TCM
method is shown in Figure 2. The tree has good support
and the clade with the least support (Canis familiaris and
Bos taurus) is still supported by more than 36% of the gene
trees. Comparing the TCM species tree topology with that
obtained with other consensus methods (M50% and MRe)
shows that all methods arrive at the same conclusion.

Conclusion
We have implemented a rooted triple consensus method
that is not prone to AGTs and have demonstrated that it
performs equal or better than the traditional Majority
Rule Consensus method at reconstructing species trees
across a range of scales.

It should be noted that with small numbers of genes, error
in species tree reconstruction is dominated by stochastic
effects for both large and small θ.
The effects of maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree
reconstruction errors in the gene trees was investigated. It
was found that reconstruction accuracy of both methods
considered (TCM and MRe) were degraded similarly. We
conclude that reconstruction errors do not bias the species
tree reconstruction any more in TCM than other consensus methods.
The support an AGT topology can have must be below 1/
3 or about 33%. This follows from the fact that if there are
just 3 lineages surviving past some speciation event, all
three of the possible topologies are equiprobable and
hence no AGT. While if we consider 4 lineages surviving
into a common species, the most likely topology has
probability 1/9. Five or more gene lineages surviving until
a recent common ancestor have maximal likelihood gene
trees with even lower probabilities [16,26,27]. Once the
different cases have been taken into account over a species
tree, the total contribution an AGT can have is less than 1/
3. This has also been verified with simulations.
A metazoan data set was compiled in order to compare
the method with real data. The results indicated that AGTs
do not play a role in reconstruction problems of the sizes
considered. There was no difference between the construction methods considered (M50%, MRe and TCM). In this
case we can rule out AGTs when we consider the maximum gene tree support that an AGT can have is less than
33%.
Not presented are a large number of data sets investigated
that do not show an AGT signature. In particular high support of typically more than 50% is common in eukaryotes
with large numbers of genes [5]. Other examples lack the
number of loci to consider AGTs or have species trees of
only 3 taxa [41,50]. Furthermore the AGT signature is a
very poorly supported clade (¿33% or less) and at this
point our models of evolution present large enough
uncertainties that we would not back such a clade with
confidence. For example [18] although it had both sufficient numbers of taxa and loci, we only considered the
data which could produce statistically distinguishable
trees.
Referring to a recent study on the metazoan species tree
[34] we note that much of the tree has high support and
furthermore they demonstrate the strong dependence of
phylogenetic reconstruction error on this tree. In fact a
majority of studies use a very conservative threshold when
determining species trees and prefer to leave the tree unresolved.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/118

Another reason for the current lack of AGT signatures in
the data may be due to the fact that a species tree wide
effective population parameter (θ) is small. Consider a
speciation event caused by geographical isolation (eg at
the last glacial maximum). At the time of isolation the
population size is much smaller than the original population of the founding species. The net result is that the
effective population can be very small and the likelihood
of AGTs also correspondingly small. However much larger
species trees and larger numbers of sampled genes will
lead to data sets in the future that AGTs will need to be
considered.
In the case that AGTs are present M50% would never fully
resolve the species tree and MRe would reconstruct an
incorrect species tree. Our method resolves these issues
without a large computational burden for larger data sets
with large numbers of species and loci. If rooted topologies or a good outgroup is available, and M50% does not
resolve the species tree adequately, then TCM should be
used in preference to MRe. As bigger data sets become
available and as biologists desire to resolve larger species
trees that all diverged at similar times, we believe a TCM
approach to species tree reconstruction will become an
important tool.

Methods
First a species tree is generated from a Yule prior or a constant rate birth process with no extinction. Then a number
of gene trees are generated from this species tree. For some
simulations DNA alignments are then generated from the
gene trees. The maximum likelihood method phyML [45]
was used to estimate the phylogenies from the sequence
data. In our case we do not reconstruct the phylogeny with
a clock although the underlying coalescent model would
produce only clocklike trees. In order to locate the root we
add a outgroup for all sequence data. This outgroup is
used to form rooted three taxa trees, that is, quartets where
one taxon in the quartet is always the outgroup. For most
of the simulations we do not include gene tree reconstruction for performance reasons and the generated gene trees
are used directly by the estimating methods. This represents the ideal performance of these methods.

⎛n⎞
Once the gene trees were generated or found, each ⎜ ⎟
⎝3⎠
rooted triplet tree was considered across all gene trees for
the dataset. That is, for each set of three taxa the majority
rule was used to decide which of the three topologies to
⎛n⎞
select. After this step there are ⎜ ⎟ rooted three taxa trees
⎝3⎠
that hopefully contain no conflicts if there are sufficient
gene trees. In practise however, with real data there will be

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:118

some conflict. We combine these rooted three taxa trees
using the quartet puzzling heuristic [43] the details of
which are presented below. The result was compared to
the true species tree, and scored correct if and only if it has
the same topology. That is, we only consider if the species
tree is recovered correctly or not. The MRe consensus
method was implemented and compared to our method
with several options.
An implementation of root triple consensus program is
publicly available at http://www.cibiv.at/software/triplec/
and also [see Additional file 1].
Tree Puzzle Heuristic
Quartet Puzzling [43] is a simple but effective heuristic for
combining potentially conflicting quartets for tree inference. Mapping a quartet method to rooted three taxa trees
is straightforward once the root in the reconstructed
topology is treated as a special label or taxon with a "virtual" branch from the true root to this "root" taxon. In this
way when new taxa are added they can be connected
above the current root. This is equivalent to simply using
the original quartet puzzling algorithm with an extra
taxon (the outgroup) to denote the root on both the quartets used and the reconstructed tree, and we only use the

⎛n⎞
⎜ ⎟ quartets that contain this root label taxon. We now
⎝3⎠
describe the algorithm in detail.
Consider the set of n taxa with labels  ∈ {1, 2,...n} and

⎛n⎞
the set of ⎜ ⎟ triples denoted  ∈ {{a, b, c} : 1 ≤ a <b
⎝3⎠
<c ≤ n}. Each triple {a, b, c} can form any one of three
rooted three taxa trees, namely (a, b|c), (a, c|b) and (b, c|a).
Here we use the notation that the rooted triplet tree (a,
b|c) is equivalent to the Newick formatted tree ((a, b), c)
placing the root between c and the (a, b) clade. We consider the rooted triplet tree occurring across all gene tree
most frequently as the correct one for any 3 taxa.
We start with the first rooted triplet tree. We now add a
single taxon at a time until we have added all the taxa. We
add taxon x to a tree with the first x - 1 taxa already present
as follows. For every triple (a, b, x), 1 ≤ a <b ≤ x - 1 we
inspect the rooted triplet tree. If the rooted triplet tree is
(a, b|x), for example, then the taxon cannot be added on
any edge between a and b without conflicting with this
rooted triplet tree. Therefore we add a penalty of one on
all edges on the path between a and b. Similarly if the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/118

rooted triplet tree was (a, x|b) we would add a penalty of
1 on all edges between b and the root, recalling that there

⎛ x −1⎞
is a "virtual" edge above the root. Once all ⎜
⎟ triples

have been inspected. The new taxon x is added to the edge
with the lowest penalty. In the case of a tie we choose
which edge to add to randomly. First we note that if the
set of rooted triplet trees do not conflict then we will
always reconstruct the correct tree. However we also note
that if the rooted triplet trees do conflict then the reconstructed tree will depend on the order the taxa are added.
Because of this we generate a set of intermediate trees with
randomised taxa order, and then take a consensus of this
set of trees. The consensus method used is discussed
below. The default is to generate 5000 intermediate trees
from a set of rooted three taxa trees.
Consensus Methods
Avoiding unnecessary notation, we can represent any vertex in a rooted topology as a set of all the taxa that are
below that vertex. The root therefore is the full set of taxa
labels while vertices elsewhere are subsets of their parent
vertex. All the tree majority consensus methods start the
same way. All the subsets induced by vertices in the rooted
trees of interest are ranked by frequency of occurrence.
The methods vary in the way these ranked subsets are
stitched back together to form a tree.

The method we used with the quartet puzzling is the Relative Majority consensus method [23]. We simply add
subsets starting from the most highly supported subset
until the first subset conflicts with previously added subsets. A conflicting subset is a subset that cannot be placed
anywhere in the tree where it is constrained to be a subset
of a parent vertex and all descendant vertices are subsets
of itself. Thus, we have a tree that, although may not be
fully resolved, only contains vertices which are supported
more than any other vertex not in the tree.
In contrast, the MRe method continues to add non-conflicting subsets until the tree is resolved or there are no
subsets left. Thus, the consensus tree may contain vertices
that are supported less than some contradicting vertex not
present in the tree.
