Abstract
Background: Independent identification of genes in different organisms and assays has led to a
multitude of names for each gene. This balkanization makes it difficult to use gene names to locate
genomic resources, homologs in other species and relevant publications.
Methods: We solve the naming problem by collecting data from a variety of sources and building
a name-translation database. We have also built a table of homologs across several model
organisms: H. sapiens, M. musculus, R. norvegicus, D. melanogaster, C. elegans, S. cerevisiae, S. pombe
and A. thaliana. This allows GeneSeer to draw phylogenetic trees and identify the closest homologs.
This, in turn, allows the use of names from one species to identify homologous genes in another
species. A website http://geneseer.cshl.org/ is connected to the database to allow user-friendly
access to our tools and external genomic resources using familiar gene names.
Conclusion: GeneSeer allows access to gene information through common names and can map
sequences to names. GeneSeer also allows identification of homologs and paralogs for a given gene.
A variety of genomic data such as sequences, SNPs, splice variants, expression patterns and others
can be accessed through the GeneSeer interface. It is freely available over the web http://
geneseer.cshl.org/ and can be incorporated in other tools through an http-based software interface
described on the website. It is currently used as the search engine in the RNAi codex resource,
which is a portal for short hairpin RNA (shRNA) gene-silencing constructs.

Background
"Biologists would rather share their toothbrush than share a
gene name":Michael Ashburner [1]. Biologists use a variety
of names for genes, based on their specialization. It is a
daunting task to use gene names to locate resources such
as sequences or publications. For example:
1. ABCA4, ABC10, ABCR, FFM, RMP, RP19, STGD, STGD1
are all names for the same gene; ATP binding cassette, sub
family A (ABC1).

2. The same gene name can be written in different ways;
cyclinD1 versus cyclin D1.
3. Researchers modify names; hPRL is used to denote the
human form of PRL.
4. Names can be species specific. For example, human p53
is called tumor protein 53 (Li-Fraumeni syndrome), whereas
in mouse it is called transformation related protein 53
(trp53).

5. Names can be specialization specific. The same gene is
known as PUF60 in the pre-mRNA splicing field and FIR
in the transcription field. It is also known by the names
RoBPI and siah-bp. The D. melanogaster field knows it as
hfp. To add to the confusion, yeast has a family of proteins
called PUF that have similar function but are unrelated in
terms of sequence homology.
In order to locate genomic resources for a given gene using
a familiar name, a reference name has to first be identified
from GenBank (or other databases such as Swiss-Prot,
TrEMBL [2] or ENSEMBL [3]). This reference name can
then be used to access resources from a variety of databases (GenBank, ENSEMBL etc.). For example, once [GenBank:NM_000546] is identified as one of the reference
names for p53, then sequences and other resources can be
easily accessed in GenBank. But a search for p53 in the
nucleotide database at NCBI [4] results in a list of more
than 5700 accessions (over 285 pages), which necessitates
manual curation to find the specific accessions of interest.
It is possible to narrow down the search using advanced
search features, but is error-prone and inconvenient,
requiring several trials before a search can be fine-tuned.
There are attempts being made to streamline and standardize the naming process through the HUGO gene
nomenclature committee (HGNC [5]). Unfortunately,
there are historic names from different fields and scientists still tend to use fanciful names (especially in the D.
melanogaster field, where names such as crossbronx, discorelated etc. are quite common).
Thus, there is a need for a tool that allows accessing information through names that are familiar to biologists from
different sub-fields. In addition, analysis of large datasets
creates the need for a programming interface that allows a
program to access resources and accessions. Once a programming interface is designed, a website can be designed
quite easily, to provide user-friendly access to the programming interface through cgi scripts and present results
in an aesthetic and ergonomic fashion.
There are other tools and approaches that partially solve
some of these problems and these are discussed and compared to GeneSeer in the discussion section.

Implementation
GeneSeer retrieves and stores synonyms for the model
organisms: H. sapiens, M. musculus, R. norvegicus, D. melanogaster, C. elegans, S. cerevisiae, S. pombe and A. thaliana
from the following sources, GenBank [4], FlyBase [6],
ExPASy [2,7], HUGO [5], ENSEMBL [3], UCSC [8], and
Gene Ontology [9]. It also holds sequences for proteins
and nucleotides as well as related information (splice variants, expression patterns etc.) about the genes. Similari-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/134

ties (homologies) between proteins are pre-calculated and
stored in GeneSeer.
This paper is organized with the description of the software tools used in GeneSeer coming first followed by the
algorithm and the underlying architecture.
Software tools
There are three critical software tools we use, a database
server, a genomic sequence server and a viewer to display
alignments.
Database
We store most of the data (except for sequence data) in a
MySQL relational database [10]. There are separate tables
for synonyms from each data source and an auxiliary table
for synonyms from data sources such as micro-arrays or
RNAi libraries. The data management is described in more
detail in the name-translation section below.
Genome packer (Gpacker)
GeneSeer needs to be able to frequently access sections of
sequences from the sequence database. A tool called
Gpacker was developed to allow fast random access to any
of the SOFAR (described below) sequences or assembled
genomic sequences. Gpacker uses a binary system to store
sequence information, using 4 bits for each base in nucleotide data (a DNA sequence requires only 2 bits per position, but if SNP data is included, then 4 bits are necessary)
and 8 bits for each amino acid in protein data (to account
for the 20 possible amino acids). The binary files are
indexed, with the indices stored in a database. This allows
for fast random access of sequences.
Light weight genome viewer (lwgv)
Many genes exhibit alternative splicing, with several splice
variants created from a single locus. In addition, there are
annotations of features such as repeats, SNPs, CpG islands
etc. The light weight genome viewer (lwgv) is used to display the annotations of features at a given genomic locus.
This tool also allows navigation to other resources on the
web, such as NCBI [4] and UCSC [8], lwgv was developed
for in-house use and is now publicly available at Source
Forge [11].
Architecture of GeneSeer
GeneSeer has three key features, the SOFAR database,
name translation tables, and homology tables. SOFAR is a
non-redundant collection of transcript sequences in each
genome, whose construction is described below. The
name-translation tables connect synonyms to each other.
The homology tables contain pre-computed similarity
scores for all pairs of proteins between and within species
from a non-redundant collection, based on SOFAR.

Figure 1
Web interface for GeneSeer
Web interface for GeneSeer. The front page of the GeneSeer website.

GeneSeer is designed as a hub-and-spokes system, with
the SOFAR database serving as the hub and the connections to resources and names serving as spokes. Every
name or sequence that is submitted gets translated to a
SOFAR name, either directly via the synonym tables, or
indirectly through a BLAST [12] search of the SOFAR
sequence database or through the use of the homology
tables. SOFAR members are linked to resources and information, both internal and external to GeneSeer. We
describe the three components of this architecture below.
SOFAR – Set Of FastA Representatives
Entrez Gene [13] (formerly LocusLink) provides an indexing for coding regions of the genome. However, this
indexing is not complete, since there are regions that have
cDNAs associated with them, which are not in Entrez
Gene. Another feature that would be useful, but not provided by Entrez Gene, is a set of non-redundant accessions

to represent each locus. The term locus is used here as a
synonym for a coding region of the genome.
We built a set of mRNA accessions that includes the
known genes and expert-curated cDNAs called SOFAR for
each organism to overcome these problems. SOFAR is the
key to GeneSeer's ability to return a concise set of results
for any search.
The SOFAR database for an organism starts with one coding sequence. Each subsequent coding sequence that is
considered for addition to the database gets checked for
similarity to sequences already in SOFAR, through a
BLAST [12] search, and gets added only if it is sufficiently
different. We use a criterion of 60% similarity as a cutoff
for entry into SOFAR.

BMC Genomics 2005, 6:134

The order in which sequences are considered for inclusion
in SOFAR is crucial. In the case of human and mouse
genomes, ordered gene lists are created by first using genes
from RefSeq [14], NCBI's reference sequence resource,
then sequences from Entrez Gene loci but not in RefSeq
and then sequences that are expert annotated but are not
in Entrez Gene, such as some kinases [15] and cDNAs for
other functional groups. RefSeq annotates genes according to the reliability of the underlying evidence, for example, validated ranks higher than predicted. This is used to
order the RefSeq genes amongst themselves. In case of all
else being equal, the sequences are ordered by length
(longest first).
The arbitrary 60% similarity cutoff can cause two kinds of
mis-identifications,
1. Two similar sequences that are from different loci get
assigned to the same locus, while they should have separate entries in SOFAR, e.g. duplicated genes such as FUT5
and FUT6 which occur on different loci on human chromosome 19.
2. Two sequences that are from the same locus can get
identified as being sufficiently different from each other
and get separate entries in SOFAR (e.g. INK4a and ARF are
the same Entrez Gene, CDKN2A [16], figure 6).
Most of the cases from the first type can be resolved using
Entrez Gene indices, however there remain eighty-nine
cases of SOFAR members from multiple loci, all of which
are immunoglobulin genes. For example, [GenBank:M14158] and [GenBank:D86998] are from different
loci, but both are genomic sequences that contain parts of
an immunoglobulin gene. On searching for them in GeneSeer, it tries to BLAST these sequences against SOFAR and
comes up with unrelated genes. GeneSeer is not very useful for accessing resources for genes from this family.
IMGT, the international ImMunoGeneTics information
system [17,18] with its specialized sequence (IMGT/
LIGM-DB) and gene (IMGT/GENE-DB [19]) databases is
better suited for this purpose.
It is important to note that the two genes INK4a and ARF
[16] are sufficiently different that they warrant inclusion
as separate entries, since they have distinct sequences and
functions. In H. sapiens there are 1130 loci which have
multiple SOFAR members. This is not a problem, as the
SOFAR members are different from each other and we
want SOFAR to contain all possible non-redundant coding sequences.
As an additional step, unique sequences from splice variants are then entered to ensure that SOFAR contains every
possible transcribed 25-mer.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/134

A SOFAR database has been built for each of the organisms in GeneSeer. In the case of D. melanogaster, the set of
FBgn numbers provided by FlyBase [6], which are a unique
set of genes similar to Entrez Gene, was used to create the
SOFAR database.
Almost every SOFAR member has a corresponding protein, except in the case of partial coding sequences, predicted genes and non-coding RNAs. These proteins can be
used to construct a SOFAR set of proteins, which is used
to generate data for the homology tables and viewer
described below.
The SOFAR database is useful for other purposes, such as
the design of RNAi hairpin constructs that can silence single genes [20]. Designs were checked against the SOFAR
database to ensure that they did not match (with up to 2
mismatches) more than one sequence in the database.
Name translations
Each of the following databases, HUGO [5], ExPASy [2,7]
(Swiss-Prot and TREMBL names), ENSEMBL [3], GenBank
[4], FlyBase [6] and Gene Ontology [9], comes with a list
of synonyms, which were downloaded and entered into a
separate table for each dataset. The Genbank data contains a mapping from gene names to Entrez Gene IDs. The
bulk of the names in GeneSeer are taken directly from a
file provided at NCBI's ftp site [21]. FlyBase provides additional synonyms. The set of names is extended even further by extracting names from the definition lines of
sequences which cross-reference an Entrez Gene ID.

Information relevant to the individual mRNA accessions,
such as coding sequences (CDS) and protein domains, is
extracted from GenBank flat files and stored in additional
tables. The system utilizes the Entrez Taxonomy database
[22,23] for translating between taxonomy ids and organism names. Up-to-date Gene Ontolgy (GO) [9] terms and
associations are also incorporated, which allows users to
search for genes by GO terms. To find GO terms for genes,
it is easier to use tools such as GObar [24] or AMIGO [25].
Tables of genomic alignments provided by UCSC [8] are
directly imported to the GeneSeer database. These alignments are currently used to help visualize the exon-intron
structure of the genes.
An auxiliary translation table is used to store names that
might be specific to particular datasets such as short hairpin names from the publicly available RNAi libraries or
probe names from microarrays.
The database tables remain current through regular
updates. The active GeneSeer database is replaced once
every month, after a new version of the database is built
and tested.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/134

Each name gets mapped to a SOFAR representative. If an
accession or EST name is submitted to the system and it is
not recognized, then GeneSeer downloads the sequence
and uses BLAST against SOFAR to identify its name. If this
fails, then a mapping to the genome is used to identify the
closest locus that contains a SOFAR representative. There
are cases where everything fails and nothing is returned,
such cases have to be curated manually, as they are usually
ESTs that might not be reliable. Everytime such a translation succeeds, the result gets cached for fast response the
next time around. The cached results will not survive an
update to the GeneSeer system.

Results

Homology tables and viewer
GeneSeer can identify homologs across species and
present a phylogenetic tree. A matrix of similarity scores,
based on BLAST [12], is pre-calculated for all pairs of
SOFAR proteins in the system. The construction of the
SOFAR protein database is described above. This matrix is
used to generate clusters of related proteins. The clusters
are aligned, using ClustalW [26], when the user requests a
tree. A phylogenetic tree is then created from this multiple
alignment using PHYLIP [27], which has been modified
to run in batch mode, to build rooted and unrooted trees.
A custom program renders the tree in scalable vector graphics (SVG) format to allow user interaction. This tree is not
the same as one that would be derived from a careful
alignment of domains and might be less accurate, but it
definitely allows quick identification of close homologs.
The results of the homology viewer can be a starting point
for a more detailed phylogenetic analysis of the proteins
in a family.

Since GeneSeer is accessible over http, programs can be
written in almost any language to use it. We have plans to
improve programmatic access, especially using semanticweb [29] based technologies such as Resource Description
Framework(RDF), but improvements will be driven primarily by user-feedback and the needs of the community.

The homology viewer can be accessed using the Action
menu item, explore-homologs, in the results page of a GeneSeer search. The result of clicking on this link is a page
that allows fine-tuning the search parameters, or eliminating a species that might not be of interest. If the threshold
of BLAST similarity scores is set lower, then fewer
homologs will be considered while drawing the phylogenetic tree. Limiting the cluster sizes is important as the
rendering of the phylogenetic tree can take a long time if
there are too many members in the family, leading to a
time-out error from the browser.
Sometimes it is not possible to reach a protein in a distant
species directly. In such cases, it may be possible to use an
intermediate organism to make the connection, that is,
the intermediate organism's protein has homology to proteins in both species of interest. An expand checkbox in the
fine-tuning page described above, allows such an
exploration.

The GeneSeer server [28] can be accessed either using a
web-browser or through a programming interface that is
described below.
Gene names can be entered by hand or uploaded in the
form of files containing lists. Sequences can also be
uploaded in the form of fasta files. Results can be downloaded in the form of excel spreadsheets or text files and
can be used to access information from NCBI, or to access
splice variants and homologs. Tissue specificity of mRNA
expression can also be accessed.

chby=sl.
GeneSeer search features
GeneSeer is flexible in the kinds of names that can be used
for searching. Thus, searches can be conducted using Gene
Symbols/Names, Keywords (partial terms such as casp for
caspase), Keyword Symbols (partial symbols, such as erb
for erbb2), OMIM ids (online mendelian inheritance in
man [30]), diseases/disorders (such as diabetes), Tissue
specificity (tissue expression patterns, such as genes
expressed in muscle, derived from UniGene [31]), Gene
Accessions, Protein Accessions, Entrez Gene IDs (from
Entrez Gene [13]), UniGene Cluster IDs (from UniGene
[31]), CDD Domain IDs (from conserved domain database [32]), Gene Ontology IDs (from Gene Ontology
[9]), Definitions (from definition lines in GenBank [4]),
HUGO IDs (from IDs defined by HUGO [5]), ENSEMBL
IDs (from IDs defined by ENSEMBL [3]), SNPs (from
dbSNP [33]) and Sequences (nucleic acid and protein
sequences).

Search terms can be entered either individually or in a
comma-separated list or by uploading files (e.g. Excel

Page 5 of 13
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2005, 6:134

spreadsheets, fasta files, or simple text files) containing
the list of terms.
The easiest option is to first use the automatic search
mode. The software will try to guess what the user has provided (accession, symbol etc.) and return its best answer.
The automatic mode uses a restrictive search first, such as
a name search, and iteratively expands the types of
searches it performs, and stops searching when it finds a
result. If this is unsatisfactory, then the Go Further button
can improve results. The Go Further button will continue
a few more methods and return more ambiguous results.
If the results continue to be unsatisfactory, then one of the
specialized modes (listed above) will need to be used and
modifying the search terms might also help. For example,
if caspase2 does not return a result, a search with casp as a
keyword will return results that will definitely include caspase 2.
Results are displayed on a webpage but can also be downloaded to a comma-separated-value (csv) file using the
download .xls operation provided on the results page. The
csv file can be opened in a spreadsheet program or a text
editor. If possible, the returned results always show the
Entrez Gene IDs for each name. GeneSeer can be used to
translate names into IDs for use in other programs which
prefer to use Entrez Gene IDs, such as GObar [24].
In addition, on the results page, NCBI [4] pages for the
search results can be accessed. Each individual result also
has an associated Action link, that allows exploration of
PubMed [34], for papers related to the item), tissues,
UCSC (the genome browser at UCSC for the relevant
genomic region) [8], explore_homology (view an
approximate phylogeny of related genes), and visualize
gene (visualize the genomic region and study splice
variants).
If GeneSeer fails to find any of the terms, they are listed on
the results page. The failures can be re-analysed using different search methods (searching by "keyword", "symbol"
or other variations). As a last resort, a bug report can be
sent via the website and a human curator will resolve the
issue.
Complicated queries using the search history button can
also be performed: an example is the search for all caspases that are expressed in the human brain, which is
explained below. A list of searches done using any computer are stored on the server, and can be accessed using the
Search History link. This link can be used to access prior
searches or limit search results. For example, one can
search first for casp as "keyword symbol" and then for
mRNAs expressed in the brain, searching by tissue for the
term brain. The queries can be accessed using the search

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/134

history button and can be combined using boolean logic
(AND/OR/NOT/XOR) to get mRNAs that are caspases and/
or/not/xor expressed in the brain.
Specific examples of GeneSeer use are given in the next
section.

Discussion
We have addressed three problems in genomic research
with this project,
1. Access to genomic information through gene names:
Biologists have been struggling with this problem for
many years, especially in the genomic era where data on
sequences has been piling up at a rapid pace.
2. Mapping sequences to gene names: Data from a variety
of sources can be in the form of DNA or protein sequences
and it is useful to be able to get back to other resources for
the gene to which the sequence fragment belongs.
3. Identification of homologs (both orthologs between
species and paralogs within a species) across several species for a given gene: It is difficult to locate orthologs and
paralogs, given the name of a gene in one species. It would
also be useful to get a quick view of an approximate phylogeny of the set of genes returned.
We use the gene p53 to showcase some of the abilities of
GeneSeer. Figure 2 shows the result of searching for p53
on GeneSeer. Figure 3 shows the alignment of the splice
variants of p53 accessed through the Action menu on the
page shown in figure 2. Figures 4 and 5 show a phylogenetic tree for p53 generated using the Action menu on the
page shown in figure 2.
GeneSeer can handle all the examples (ABC1, cyclin D1,
hPRL, p53, and PUF60) cited in the introduction. It has
information on several model organisms: H. sapiens, M.
musculus, R. norvegicus, D. melanogaster, C. elegans, S. cerevisiae, S. pombe and A. thaliana. It can help visualize splice
variants, SNPs and short hairpin RNA silencing constructs
(shRNAs, using names from RNAi codex [35], it returns
the mRNA that contains the construct) that align with any
mRNA. It allows searching for homologs for any gene
across species, based on our pairwise sequence alignments
of the proteins.
Another example that affords some valuable lessons is the
Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) region in the
human genome [36]. There are several genes in this region
that exhibit duplications and also exhibit variations across
populations. One such gene, HLA-A (accession [GenBank:NM_002116] can be found through GeneSeer.
There are variants such as Aw-80 (accession [Gen-

Bank:Q09160], which is in the same locus, but will not
appear as a separate gene. In fact, a search on GeneSeer
will return HLA-A. To study the variants and the intricacies
of this gene family (as well as the immunoglobulin family
cited earlier), the best place to start is use a specialized
information system such as IMGT [17]. HUGO [5] now
assigns names starting with the letters HCG to genes in the
MHC, one way to search for them in GeneSeer is to use

HCG% and do an automatic search, but this will return
several unrelated hits, a better approach, since we know
HCG is going to be a part of a gene symbol, is to search by
keyword symbol with this term.
GeneSeer has some limitations, that necessitate ocassional human intervention. GeneSeer is designed to err on
the side of caution. It will find unique answers where pos-

sible, but will leave in all ambiguities when a unique resolution is impossible without more information. For
example, the symbol nos is used for both nitric oxide synthase and Nanos in D. melanogaster, GeneSeer will return
both results. The program will reduce the number of possibilities, so that a human user is not overwhelmed by
information. Sometimes human judgement is required to
find homologs of genes: For example, while GeneSeer will
list all homologs of staufen, the human user has to decide
which one is interesting from a biological standpoint and
if it is a functional homologue, that is, contains the active
domains of interest.

Comparison with other tools
Most of the tools we have been able to find are geared
towards controlled vocabularies and aim at reducing the
diversity of names. Our viewpoint is different, we start
with unique sequences represented in our SOFAR databases for each species, and resolve all names to sequences
in this database. We describe some of these papers and
tools to give an idea of why GeneSeer is unique.

Some work has been done on identification and disambiguation of gene symbols, we consider one such report
here [37] which is a thesaurus-based approach. The
method underlying their approach of building a translation table using names from a variety of sources is similar,
but their goal is to recognize names in documents and

abstracts in order to mine texts, while GeneSeer aims to
use gene symbols/names to locate genomic resources and
homologs in other species. We also believe our synonym
table is much more extensive, since we have identified the
gaps in various synonym tables that are available, through
intensive field testing.

GeneCards [38] is a database of human genes, their products and their involvement in diseases. It is designed to
return concise information on the function of genes and
is human-gene centric. A search for p53 results in 925 hits,
which are organized into microcards (single line descriptors only) and minicards that have detailed information
and are organized by relevance to the search term. The top
microcard is the actual p53 gene, and the second one in

Detailed view of p53 phylogeny. A more detailed view of the phylogenetic trees seen as thumbnails in the previous figure.
Each protein name is followed by the Taxonomy ID for the organism, as specified by NCBI [22]. For example, 9606 is the Taxonomy ID for Homo sapiens. Here, the tree is rendered in SVG format (scalable vector graphics) where each protein name is
linked to resources for that gene which appear in a pop-up window on a mouse-over. The pop-up window (the blue box in the
figure) can be locked in place by a click on the left-mouse-button. A static jpeg format image is also offered on the website. The
SVG image allows control of image magnification through the mouse button.

Figure 6
Result of a search for INK4A in H. sapiens
Result of a search for INK4A in H. sapiens. In the results that are returned for each locus, all the RefSeq [14] accessions
at the locus are returned, but the ones in SOFAR are highlighted in green. If a locus does not have a RefSeq accession, then
only the accessions in SOFAR are returned. In this case the locus is CDKN2A [16] with three accessions, two of which, [GenBank:NM_058195] (ARF) and [GenBank:NM_058197] (INK4A), are from SOFAR and highlighted in green. This is discussed in
the text.

this list is Mdm2, which interacts with p53. To find Mdm2
through a p53 search in GeneSeer, one would have to
search by Definitions for the term p53 and it will return
p53 and others that interact with p53. Searching for PUF
as a keyword symbol in GeneSeer returns PUF60/RoBPI/
siah-bp while GeneCards returns unrelated genes. The
point of this discussion is not to find cases where GeneSeer excels, but to highlight the differences in the abilities
of these programs.

DBGET [45] holds information from a variety of databases. But a search for PUF60 failed and a search for p53
returned a long list that was not easily comprehensible.
Thus, GeneSeer is more comprehensive and has an easier
interface when compared with other public tools. Its focus
and goals are also a bit different from most tools that are
currently available online.

Conclusion
Global Gene Hunter [39] is a tool that is a part of the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) [40]. Given a gene
name, the site runs searches on six databases, Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD), PubMed, Entrez Gene,
Protein Data Bank Homologs, UniProt [41] and MIPS
[42]. The search can be limited to a subset of these databases. The results from each of these databases is returned
as part of a large page, but are not organized. It suffers
from the failings of the search interfaces provided by these
databases and puts the onus of organizing the results on
the user.
BioMinT [43], the Gene and Protein Name Synonyms
Database, allows the user to find synonyms. A search for
PUF60 on this site listed fourteen H. sapiens and twentyone D. melanogaster genes and proteins, but they were
essentially products of a single gene from each genome.
The returned results could have been compressed further.
GeneDB [44] is a resource that provides a portal for access
to data generated by pathogen sequencing at several collaborating research centers. Searching for PUF60 found 7
hits in G. morsitans, probably from the same gene, the
interface is a bit inconvenient and the results were not
comprehensive.

GeneSeer is a powerful engine that is available freely over
the web and can be accessed either by a web-browser or by
standard programming languages. GeneSeer is an
evolving project, there are many more features that can be
added, such as sequence and genomic data from new
organisms. We plan to add data from F. rubripes [46] in
the near future. Prokaryotic gene names are in the system,
but it requires additional work to develop SOFAR databases and the homology viewer. User-feedback will be
used to prioritize improvements and addition of new features. We want to make GeneSeer compatible with the
goals of the semantic web [29] by adding features such as
RDF/xml downloads, that will allow it to be indexed and
be machine readable. GeneSeer was designed with flexible
use in mind, allowing it be freely incorporated into other
tools. It is used in several tools developed at Cold Spring
Harbor Laboratory (such as the RNAi Codex, an shRNA
portal [35]).

Availability and requirements
The GeneSeer server [28] can be freely accessed over http
allowing easy access from any computer with an internet
connection and a web-browser. GeneSeer can also be
accessed via a programming interface that has been
described above.
