Abstract
Background: An outbreak of aseptic meningitis occurred in Tianshui city of Gansu Province, the People’s Republic
of China, from March to June 2005. A total of 85 patients were clinical confirmed as aseptic meningitis in this
outbreak.
Results: CVA9 was mainly responsible for this outbreak supported by the clinical manifestations of the patients,
epidemiological data of the outbreak, the results of RT-PCR and complete VP1 sequence determination,
conventional neutralization assays, IgM serological assays, viral isolation and phylogenetics analysis. Through
phylogenetic analysis and homogeneity analysis for partial VP1 gene, the nucleotide and amino acid homologies
between Gansu isolates and former Chinese CVA9 strains were 88.2%-96.1% and 97.2%-99.2%, respectively. Multiple
transmission chains of CVA9 occurred in different provinces or years in China. Moreover, in order to clarify the
genotype of CVA9, Gansu CVA9 strains isolated in this outbreak were compared with other CVA9 isolates based on
VP1/2A junction regions (genotyping region) and they might belong to a new genotype of CVA9, which could be
assigned for genotype XIII,
Conclusions: CVA9 was confirmed as the pathogen responsible for this outbreak. The phylogenetic analysis
indicated that the CVA9 strains isolated in this outbreak might belong to a new genotype.

Background
Human Enteroviruses (HEV) comprise more than 80
distinct serotypes within the Picornaviridae family, and
are currently classified into five species: Poliovirus and
HEV-A, HEV-B, HEV-C, and HEV-D [1]. Most infections are asymptomatic, but enteroviruses can cause a
wide variety of clinical diseases, the most common of
the potentially severe enterovirus disease in pediatric
patients remains aseptic meningitis. Serotypes of the
HEV-B species including CVB1-6, ECHO, CVA9,
HEV69 and HEV73 are the most frequently implicated
[2-6], which could cause sporadic cases, outbreaks or
epidemics of aseptic meningitis worldwide including
China [6].
In China, the repeated outbreaks of HEV-associated
diseases occurred in recent years, and these patients

were reported to have an aseptic meningitis symptom
were usually caused by HEV-B [7,8]. Here, we describe
an outbreak of aseptic meningitis in Tianshui city of
Gansu province, China, from March to June 2005. The
etiological agent responsible for this outbreak was identified and the genetic characterizations of virus strains
that were isolated from this outbreak were also analyzed.

Methods
The collections of clinical specimens in this outbreak

In this outbreak, the clinical specimens were collected
from 22 out of 85 patients during Apirl to June. Like
other 63 cases, these 22 patients came from Maiji district of Tianshui city were hospitalized cases and confirmed as aseptic meningitis when these patients were
admitted to the hospital. So it clearly showed the epidemiological linkage between 22 patients and 63 other
patients.
10 cerebrospinal fluids (CSF), 22 stool samples and 22
serum samples were collected from 22 patients with

clinical confirmed aseptic meningitis during acute-phase
infection after onset; 3 patients were also found to have
convalescent sera. A total of 32 etiology specimens and
25 sera obtained during this outbreak were stored at
-80°C and -20°C, respectively, for further analysis.

were analyzed with Kimura 2-parameter method of
MEGA 4.0 program, and neighbor-joining of phylogenetic analysis were used to provide a more reliable inference of phylogeny with MEGA 4.0 program.
Serology detection of Coxsackievirus IgM antibody

Viral RNA extraction, direct reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction and sequences determination

Viral RNA was directly extracted from the clinical specimens using a QIAamp Mini Vial RNA Extraction Kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). 10 CSF specimens and 22
stool samples from 22 patients was performed with
direct reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) by the pan-enterovirus primer pair including
primer PE1 and PE2 as previously described [9].

22 acute-phase sera collected from the clinical confirmed cases within 2-29 days after onset were detected
Coxsackievirus immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies
using an Serion ELISA classic Coxsackievirus IgM test
kits (Institute Virion/Serion GmbH, Wurzburg, Germany). This kit is quantitative and qualitative tests for
detection of human antibodies in serum or plasma
against all serotypes of Coxsackievirus.
Neutralization Test

Virus Isolation and identification

10 CSF specimens and 22 stool samples were separately
inoculated into human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cell
lines and were cultured in a maintenance medium at
36°C. Cultures that exhibited a characteristic enterovius
cytopathic effect (CPE) were identified by RT-PCR and
sequencing with the following method. If no CPE was
observed in the cultures, these were further cultured for
another 7 days. Viral RNA was extracted from culture
with CPE by using the QIAamp mini viral RNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). The entire VP1
gene was amplified by RT-PCR with the primer pairs
including the previous reported primer pair 008 and 011
[2]. The amplification products were purified using a
QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen), and the amplicons were bidirectionally sequenced using an ABI
PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems,
Hitachi, Japan).
Identification of the genotype of CVA9

Though entire VP1 region were obtained for serotyping
of human enterovirus, few sequences were available at
GenBank, so it is difficult to analyze the genetical linkage of sequences between China and other countries. In
order to clarify the genotype of CVA9, the genotyping
region (VP1/2A region) was also amplified with the previous reported primer pair named primer VP+ and 2A[10]. The RT-PCR products were purified and
sequenced with the above mentioned method.
Sequence Analysis

The sequence data were aligned, edited, and assembled
to obtain the entire VP1 gene and VP1/2A region using
Sequencher version 4.0.5 (GeneCode, Ann Arbor, MI,
USA). Sequence alignments were created with ClustalX
software 1.81, the pairwise sequence identities of the
nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences were calculated with BioEdit software 7.0. The genetic distances

In this study, according to the methods previously
described [11], conventional neutralization test was also
performed with three pairs of paired serum samples,
and the entire virion of strain Gansu05-1/GS/CHN/2005
isolated in this outbreak and identified was used as the
neutralization virus and the 50% cell infectious dose
(CCID50/50 μl) was calculated according to the Kärber
formula [12].
Nucleotide sequence accession numbers

The nucleotide sequence of the complete VP1 gene and
VP1/2A region for representative strain Gansu05-1/GS/
CHN/2005, which was determined in this study, has
been deposited in the GenBank nucleotide sequence
database under accession number GQ294574 and
GQ294575, respectively.

Results
Epidemiological investigation of this outbreak

On 4 March 2005, a child was clinical diagnosis as aseptic meningitis in Tianshui city of Gansu Province. Subsequently, the number of cases with clinical confirmed
aseptic meningitis increased rapidly. Up to 29 June
2005, a total of 85 cases, which concentrated in Maiji
district of Tianshui city of Gansu province, were clinical
confirmed as aseptic meningitis by Tianshui City People’s Hospital in this outbreak (Figure 1). Also through
the epidemiological investigation, no similar case was
reported in other districts of Tianshui city.

The clinical symptoms of the patients were fever
(>37.5°C) (79/79, 6 cases missing), headache (67/85) and
vomiting (56/85). The incidence of the relevant cases
peaked in late May to early June. All patients were less
than 13 years old, and a majority of these patients were
4-5 years old. Numbers of Gregarious children’s cases
(from kindergarten and primary school) were more than
those of scattered children. All patients had good prognosis, and no fatal case was found in this outbreak.
Laboratory confirmation of CVA9 as the pathogenic
agent in this outbreak

The specimens collected from 22 patients were identified by pan-entero RT-PCR, virus isolation/molecular
typing, IgM ELISA and NT, and the results were
showed in the table 1.
4 CSF sample and 12 stool samples (including 3 CSF
samples and 3 stool samples detected from 3 patients)
were successfully amplified with pan-enteroviruse primer pair. It indicated the enteroviruse infection responsible for this outbreak.
Among them, 8 samples including 2 CSF and 6 stool
samples were positive for virus isolation/VP1 RT-PCR,
and the other 8 samples were negative and only positive
for pan-enteroviruse directly RT-PCR, this maybe due to
the lower titer of the virus in the clinical samples. As for
the viral isolation, 2 CSF and 6 stool samples out of 32
samples (including one CSF and one stool sample from
one patient) were observed with the characteristic enterovirus CPE, which appeared within two passages after

The number of similar cases had increased dramatically. By June 29, 2005, the outbreak had affected 85 children. The numbers above column
indicated 22 out of 85 patients in this outbreak.

inoculation, and the entire VP1 was successfully amplified to obtain the predicted products of 906 bp.
Sequence determination revealed that eight viral isolates exhibited 99.9% to 100% homology in their nucleic
acid sequences. Therefore, the data showed that all the
patients were infected with the similar virus. A viral isolate designated as strain Gansu05-1/GS/CHN/2005 was
used for phylogenetic analysis. Furthermore, phylogenetic tree was conducted on the basis of the entire VP1
sequences of human enterovirus prototype strains indicated that the sequences was very close to the prototype
strain of CVA9 (strain Griggs) (Figure 2).
In ELISA detection for Coxsackievirus IgM, 10 sera
obtained positive results with the proportion of positive
samples being 45.5%. This result also supported that
Coxsackievirus infections occurred in this outbreak.
Conventional neutralization test results revealed that
the neutralization titers of the convalescent-phase samples were at least four times higher than those of the
acute-phase samples for all three pairs. This finding also
suggested that CVA9 was associated with this outbreak.
Phylogenetic analysis of CVA9

Only the partial VP1 gene (nt2583-nt3338, relative to
strain Griggs) of former Chinese CVA9 strains was
available in the GenBank database. Thus, in order to

determine the molecular epidemiology of CVA9 in
China, the phylogenetic dendrogram (Figure 3) was conducted with 12 Chinese CVA9 strains, 5 strains from
other countries and the prototype strain based on this
region. 12 Chinese CVA9 strains (including strain FJ9890 and FJ00-127 from Fujian province, strain YN148-00,
YN49-98 and YN78-97 from Yunnan province, strain
01332/SD/CHN/2001/CA9, 97089/SD/CHN/1997/CA9,
97186/SD/CHN/1997/CA9, YZ047/SD/CHN/2005/CA9,
04318/SD/CHN/2004/CA9 and 00365/SD/CHN/2000/
CA9 from Shandong province) were isolated during
1997 to 2005; 5 strains from other countries composed
of 3 Japanese strains (stain 03-171FCR2, 03-144NPC3
and 03-132NPR2) isolated in 2003, one strain (strain
06.109.3344) isolated in Australia in 2006 and one strain
(strain TR081056-02) isolated in France in 2005. Except
the prototype strain, 17 CVA9 strains could be divided
into 4 different lineages (lineage 1-4). 10 strains including 8 Chinese strains (YN148-00, YN49-98, FJ98-90,
FJ00-127, 01332/SD/CHN/2001/CA9 and 97089/SD/
CHN/1997/CA9), one Japanese strain (strain 03132NPR2) and one Australian strain (strain 06.109.3344)
belong to lineage 1; 7 strains including 5 Chinese strain
(Gansu05-1/GS/CHN/2005, 97186/SD/CHN/1997/CA9,

strains (strain 03-171FCR2 and 03-144NPC3) belong to
lineage 2; strain YN 78-97 from China form lineage 3;
and strain TR081056-02 from France form lineage 4.
The genetic distances between and within lineages
were 0.11-0.21 and 0.04-0.07, respectively. Chinese
CVA9 strains were concentrated in lineage 1, 2, and 3.
The result of the phylogenetic tree indicated that multiple transmission chains occurred in different provinces
or years. The nucleotide and amino acid homologies
between strain Gansu05-1/GS/CHN/2005 and other
Chinese CVA9 strains within this partial VP1 gene were
88.2%-96.1% and 97.2%-99.2%, respectively. And strain
Gansu05-1/GS/CHN/2005 isolated in this outbreak was
the closest to strain 97186/SD/CHN/1997/CA9 isolated
in Shandong province in 1997.
Due to few VP1 sequences were available at GenBank,
in order to investigate the genetic relationships between
strain Gansu05-1/GS/CHN/2005 and other CVA9, phylogenetic analysis were conducted on the basis of the
sequences in the junction region between the VP1 capsid protein and the 2A protease genes (VP1/2A, nt3258nt3407, relative to strain Griggs) with 37 CVA9 strains
(Figure 4). CVA9 genotypes have been reported to
define as clusters of related strains with <15% nucleotide
divergence in this region [10], and CVA9 strains could
be assigned to 12 genotypes, which were designated genotype I-XII in the chronological order of the isolation of
the earliest virus strain in each genotype [10]. In this
study, the 24.0% nucleotide divergence was found
between strain Gansu05-1/GS/CHN/2005 and the

prototype strain Griggs; compared with the genotype IXII of CVA9 strains, the nucleotide divergence of strain
Gansu05-1/GS/CHN/2005 were 17.3%-32.6%. Moreover,
strain Gansu05-1/GS/CHN/2005 formed an independent
branch in the phylogenetic tree compared with other
genotypes of CVA9 (Figure 4). So, both the results of
phylogenetic analysis and nucleotide divergence indicated that strain Gansu05-1/GS/CHN/2005 might be a
new genotype of CVA9, and could be assigned the genotype XIII. The genetic distances between 13 genotypes
were 0.17-0.41, higher than those within genotypes, and
the genetic distances between genotype XIII and other
12 genotypes were also 0.21-0.40. Unfortunately, due to
few sequences of VP1/2A region available in GenBank
database, other Chinese CVA9 strains were unable to
analyze for genotyping.
In this study, the RGD motif within the C-terminal
extension of the VP1 capsid protein of CAV9 [13] was
also found to be fully conserved among 13 CAV9 genotypes including strain Gansu05-1/GS/CHN/2005 which
suggests that the motif, although not essential for virus
viability in cell culture conditions, plays a vital role in
replication of the virus in humans.

Discussion
Enteroviruses represent the main etiological agents of
epidemics of viral meningitis and especially the serotypes related to the HEV-B species, and more than 50%
of meningitis cases were due to echovirus 30 [14]. In
2005, outbreak of aseptic meningitis occurred in

Tianshui city of Gansu Province, China. The results of
the present study indicated that CVA9 was mainly
responsible for this outbreak. This postulation is supported by the clinical manifestations of the affected
patients, epidemiological data of the outbreak, the
results of RT-PCR and sequence determination, conventional neutralization assays, IgM serological assays, viral
isolation and phylogenetics analysis.
CVA9 is a member of the A subgroup which exhibits
the typical pathogenicity in newborn mice [15], while
the disease pattern in humans is more closely related to

CVB infections. CVA9 is also one of the enteroviruses
which may be associated with aseptic meningitis, and
clinical CVA9 infections are common [16,17].
The genetic heterogeneity of enteroviruses makes it
difficult to develop molecular typing that is both reliable
and easy to perform. The genomic sequence encoding
the VP1 capsid protein gives excellent results because of
the high correlation between serotype and genetic information, and the availability of a complete database of
reference strains isolated in the 1950’s and 1960’s. In
this study, the pathogen was identified as CVA9 based

Cui et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:72
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/72

on the complete VP1 gene. Through phylogenetic analysis and homogeneity analysis for partial VP1 gene, the
strain Gansu05-1/GS/CHN/2005 shared highly homology with strains 97186/SD/CHN/1997/CA9 from Shandong province, belonging to different lineages with
other 11 Chinese CVA9 strains. It indicated that there
were multiple transmissions chains of CVA9 circulation
in different provinces in China, and the similar virus
were also found in Japan.
However, it is difficult for systematic genotyping based
on VP1 gene because few complete CVA9 VP1
sequences available in the world. Santti et al. divided
CVA9 strains into 12 genotypes using the criteria designated for PVs that strains sharing >85% identity in the
VP1/2A junction region belong to the same genotype
[18]. By compared this region of the CVA9 genome, it
was found that strain Gansu05-1/GS/CHN/2005 isolated
in this outbreak might be a new genotype of related
sequences based on this criteria and could be assigned
for genotype XIII. It seemed that this genotype virus circulated in China in recent years. So far, a number of
genetically distinct genotype of viruses may currently
circulate in the world. The identification of a new CVA9
genotype in China was useful for identifying the source,
tracking transmission pathways and documenting
changes in the viruses present in particular regions over
time. However, due to no other Chinese CVA9
sequences of VP1/2A was available to analyze for genotyping, it is very difficult to know the time of this new
genotype occurred, and whether co-circulated of other
CVA9 genotypes existed.
In recent years, CVA9 was also isolated in many other
countries including Spain, Finland, Canada, Netherland
and United States etc through routine diagnosis for clinical samples from patients suspected viral central nervous system infection [10,19]. In all genotypes of CVA9,
most of the strains within each genotype showed geographical clustering; evidence of long-distance importation of virus strains was also reported [10]. However,
because of the limit data of Chinese CVA9 strains available, it was very difficult to clarify the molecular epidemiology of CVA9 in China.
In conclusion, this is the first reporting the outbreak
of aseptic meningitis caused by CVA9 in China, and a
new genotype of CVA9 was found based on the
sequences of VP1/2A region. However, further analysis
is needed to investigate the evolution of the CVA9 by
obtained more sequences of virus strains and to find out
their genetic relationships, and molecular epidemiological surveillance of CVA9 should also be strengthened.

Conclusion
An outbreak of aseptic meningitis occurred in Tianshui
city of Gansu Province, the People’s Republic of China

in 2005. In this study, CVA9 was confirmed as the
pathogen responsible for this outbreak. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that the CVA9 strains isolated in
this outbreak might belong to a new genotype.
List of abbreviations used
CVA9: Coxsackievirus A9; RT-PCR: reverse transcription-polymerase chain
reaction; CSF: cerebrospinal fluid; HEV: Human Enteroviruses; CPE: cytopathic
effect; IgM: immunoglobulin M.
