Abstract
Background: Adjacent gene pairs in the yeast genome have a tendency to express concurrently.
Sharing of regulatory elements within the intergenic region of those adjacent gene pairs was often
considered the major mechanism responsible for such co-expression. However, it is still in debate
to what extent that common transcription factors (TFs) contribute to the co-expression of
adjacent genes. In order to resolve the evolutionary aspect of this issue, we investigated the
conservation of adjacent pairs in five yeast species. By using the information for TF binding sites in
promoter regions available from the MYBS database http://cg1.iis.sinica.edu.tw/~mybs/, the ratios
of TF-sharing pairs among all the adjacent pairs in yeast genomes were analyzed. The levels of coexpression in different adjacent patterns were also compared.
Results: Our analyses showed that the proportion of adjacent pairs conserved in five yeast species
is relatively low compared to that in the mammalian lineage. The proportion was also low for
adjacent gene pairs with shared TFs. Particularly, the statistical analysis suggested that coexpression of adjacent gene pairs was not noticeably associated with the sharing of TFs in these
pairs. We further proposed a case of the PAC (polymerase A and C) and RRPE (rRNA processing
element) motifs which co-regulate divergent/bidirectional pairs, and found that the shared TFs
were not significantly relevant to co-expression of divergent promoters among adjacent genes.
Conclusion: Our findings suggested that the commonly shared cis-regulatory system does not
solely contribute to the co-expression of adjacent gene pairs in yeast genome. Therefore we
believe that during evolution yeasts have developed a sophisticated regulatory system that
integrates both TF-based and non-TF based mechanisms(s) for concurrent regulation of
neighboring genes in response to various environmental changes.

Background
The arrangement and orientation of genes in genomes is
often shaped through evolution by mechanisms such as

unequal crossing over followed by random genetic drift or
natural selection [1,2]. Recent studies indicate that the
distribution of genes in genomes does not always happen

at random [3-5]. In the human genome, housekeeping
genes show a strong tendency to cluster together [6], and
genes that participate in the same pathway also tend to lie
adjacent to each other in the genome [5,7,8]. Moreover,
several studies indicate that adjacent genes in human
seem to co-express regardless of their intergenic distance
[9-11]. Similar phenomena have been observed in Drosophila, nematode, and yeast [12-16]. Among these observations, the co-expression of adjacent pairs is crucial
because changes in such genome organization could alter
the co-regulated transcription over the pairs [11,12].
How co-expressed genes are regulated is still unclear. Two
major mechanisms proposed are alterations of chromatin
structure and sharing of the same regulatory elements
[3,5,15]. The open conformation of the chromatin structure is required for genes to be transcribed into RNAs and
thus become expressed. A general hypothesis is that clusters of genes in the same chromatin domain have a higher
chance to be expressed simultaneously than genes located
in different chromatin domains [5,17]. Alternatively, cisregulatory elements could behave like fine modules that
alter gene expression locally. Therefore, adjacent pairs
with common upstream activation sites (UAS) or shared
regulatory systems are more likely to be co-expressed
[9,12].
Several attempts have been made to investigate the mechanism for co-expression of adjacent gene pairs. In human,
the abundance of divergent pairs relative to convergent
and tandem pairs has been reported [11], and the common CpG islands that were often found between divergent pairs were known to be associated with an "open" or
"active" chromatin [11,18,19]. However, co-expressed
groups of adjacent genes spanning 20–200 kilobases in
the Drosophila genome did not show any correlation with
known chromosomal structures [10,16]. Later, the idea of
co-expression among clustered genes was rejected by Thygesen and Zwinderman [13], whose study also failed to
discover any correlation between the chromatin domain
and co-expressed genes in Drosophila.
It is evident that in yeast adjacent gene pairs display
stronger co-expression than random pairs do [20].
Kruglyak and Tand [12] proposed that some co-expressed
pairs resulted from sharing a single regulatory system,
despite the fact that many genes controlled by separate
regulatory systems may also have highly co-expressed patterns. Hurst et al. [9] also concluded that divergent orientation is dominant for co-regulation and for conservation
of pairs, but the finding had weak statistical support.
Although these studies suggested that the sharing of a
common UAS plays an important role in regulating coexpressed pairs, and that divergent pairs are more likely to
share the same regulatory system, the co-expression level

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/352

(defined by correlation coefficient) of divergent pairs is
not significantly higher than that of tandem pairs with a
similar intergenic distance [20]. The relative contribution
of the two major mechanisms to the co-expression of
adjacent genes is still in debate for different organisms.
Recently, Byrnes et al. [21] proposed that the majority of
gene loss in yeast happened after whole-genome duplication (WGD) by single-gene deletion. Their observation
implied that adjacent gene pairs were not preserved after
WGD. On the other hand, several studies indicated that
adjacent pairs were conserved in some organisms due to
the sharing of regulatory elements [4,22]. To investigate
the contribution of regulatory elements to the co-expression of adjacent pairs, we first examined the conservation
of adjacency in five yeast species. It is of particular interest
to study the conservation of adjacent pairs using yeast species which have undergone WGD, because the duplicated
adjacent relationship would in theory be free of evolutionary selection. Importantly, the advancement of technology has led to the establishment of databases of
transcription factors (TF) and transcription factor binding
sites (TFBSs). These tools allow researchers to investigate
the mechanism for co-expression of adjacent pairs by
studying sharing of common regulatory systems. Herein,
we present a comprehensive examination of the intergenic
regions between adjacent genes to inquire whether these
pairs frequently share common TFs. Our study provides
clear evidence that sharing of the common TFs is not an
exclusive component of the driving force in co-regulation
of adjacent gene pairs in yeast.

Results
Conservation of adjacent pairs in five yeast species
In order to investigate the conservation of adjacent pairs
during the evolution of yeast, we collected S. cerevisiae
orthologues from four Saccharomyces sensu stricto species
(Table 1). In all cases, the proportions of conservation for
different adjacent patterns (i.e. divergent pairs, convergent
pairs and tandem pairs) were similar to those for random
sampling composition (p > 0.05, chi-square test), suggesting that the three adjacent patterns have equal chances to
be preserved. In more detailed analysis of stringently conserved pairs (definitions in Methods), we found that only
a small fraction of adjacent pairs had maintained their
particular adjacency relationships across these species.
The conservation ratios are relatively low compared to
those of the adjacent pairs found in S. cerevisiae (94/1491
for divergent pairs, 95/1474 for convergent pairs, and
156/2737 for tandem pairs) (Table 1). The low preservation ratios indicate that the adjacent relationship is not
tightly maintained during the course of yeast evolution.

Co-expression of conserved adjacent pairs
As shown in Fig. 1A, all three pairing types of stringently
conserved pairs have significant levels of co-expression
compared to that of random pairs (p < 0.0001, KS test).
However, there is no obvious difference in co-expression
levels between the three adjacent patterns (p > 0.01, KS
test). In particular the divergent pairs did not show a
higher co-expression as expected. On the contrary, in
comparing the expression dataset of loosely conserved
pairs, convergent and divergent pairs displayed higher coexpression levels than did tandem pairs with statistical
support (p < 0.0001, KS test) (Fig. 1B).

To investigate the conservation of co-expression tendency
in adjacent pairs, the co-expression levels between conserved pairs and non-conserved pairs were compared.

Commonly shared TFs of adjacent pairs
Since the co-expression level is not particularly high in
conserved versus in non-conserved adjacent pairs, it was
of great interest to address whether co-expression of adjacent pairs resulted from shared regulatory system [12]. In
our analysis the proportion of adjacent pairs sharing common TFs was relatively low (Table 2). In addition, among
the conserved adjacent pairs (including both stringently
and loosely conserved), only about 8.1% of them shared

single common TF and 4.4% shared multiple TFs (Table
2). The small fraction of sharing TFs among conserved
adjacent pairs suggests that the co-expression of adjacent
genes does not necessarily correlate with the shared regulatory system. Interestingly, the portion of sharing TFs
among conserved adjacent pairs is similar to that found in
non-conserved adjacent pairs, implying that adjacent
pairs with shared TFs are not necessarily subjected to a
stronger evolutionary constraint than those without
shared TFs.
To explore whether adjacent pairs with shared TFs are
more likely to be co-expressed, we compared the coexpression level of adjacent pairs with common TFs to
those without. The result showed that both groups have
significantly higher levels of co-expression relative to that
of random pairs, but no significant difference was

We acknowledge the potential bias and noise that microarray data may bear. To circumvent this problem, we also
analyzed the condition-specific datasets separately (see
Additional file 1 Fig. 1, 2, and 3) and obtained observations similar to those using the merged dataset.
The co-expression of PAC- and RRPE-regulated divergent
pairs
Since the proportion of adjacent pairs sharing TFs is low
as aforementioned, it is important to inquire whether the
shared TFs in divergent pairs are more likely to co-regulate
the divergent genes. We present a case here to illustrate the
effects of sharing regulatory system on co-expression. Beer
and Tavazoie studied two computationally discovered
sequence elements, PAC (polymerase A and C) and RRPE
(rRNA processing element), which are considered to have
combinatorial regulations on their target genes [23]. The
authors found very similar expression patterns among
genes with PAC located within 140 bp and RRPE within
240 bp of the ATG start codon, respectively.

To investigate whether such a pattern or any particular
spatial arrangement of cis-regulatory motifs exists in divergent relationships, we selected 22 divergent pairs separated by an intergenic region of less than 400 bp and
carrying both PAC and RRPE elements as annotated in the

MYBS database [24]. Their expression profiles were
extracted and compared using the method described
above. In this analysis, sixteen divergent pairs revealed no
sign of co-expression between the adjacent partners, while
the other six pairs showed positive correlations for expression. Interestingly, the sixteen independently expressed
pairs bore only a single occurrence of RRPE and PAC, in
which the genes proximal to the motifs displayed similar
expression patterns while the distal ones showed little correlation (Fig. 4A). In contrast, the remaining six divergent
pairs exhibited co-expression of flanking genes on both
sides, and they all carried multiple occurrences of RRPE or
PAC in their common promoter regions (Fig. 4B).
Two implications can be drawn from this analysis. First,
TFs tend to exert stronger regulatory effects on the gene
proximal to their binding sites in a divergent pair. Second,
sharing of TFs per se does not warrant co-regulation of
adjacent genes, yet an increase in the motif occurrences
may ensure simultaneous modulation on both sides in
the situations where co-regulation is required. Altogether
our results suggest that genes in a divergent pair do not
necessarily use the same regulatory machinery, which in
turn may lead to differential expression between the pair
partners.

Discussion
Low conservation ratio of adjacent pairs in five yeast
species
We compared the adjacency relationships of gene pairs
among five yeast species which had undergone WGD and
found random distribution for all three adjacent patterns.
The evidence supported the hypothesis that the selection
on types of adjacency along the S. cerevisiae lineage was
neutral after WGD [21]. This neutrality also explained our
observation of a low proportion of conserved adjacent
pairs in five yeast species (e.g. 5.7~6.45% for the stringently conserved group). Similar results were found in
orthologous gene pairs between the S. cerevisiae and C.
albicans genomes which had diverged before WGD [9].
Since adjacent pairs have a tendency to co-express in yeast
[20], observations from these studies contradict the
hypothesis that adjacent pairs with co-expression patterns
are more likely to maintain the adjacent relationship during evolution [4,11,22]. This implied that co-expression
of adjacent pairs may be due to other mechanisms such as
chromatin opening.

In contrast to yeast, a higher proportion of conserved
adjacent pairs were observed in the genomes of mammalian lineage [11,22]. It is possible that the selection
strength and/or mechanism over adjacency is different in
yeast than in human [11,22]. It is also interesting to note
that the ratios of conserved divergent, convergent, and
tandem pairs are similar. This leads to the conclusion that

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/352

for yeast divergent relationship is not appreciably favored
by selection, even though these pairs are more likely to
share a regulatory system and thus are more likely to display co-expression. Importantly, this notion is also different from that drawn from the vertebrate genomes, in
which the conservation ratio of divergent pairs is higher
than that of tandem pairs, suggesting a negative selection
on the separation of divergent pairs during evolution of
vertebrates [4].
It is proposed that the conservation of divergent pairs in
human has functional importance. This hypothesis is supported by the significant expression correlation and functional association among divergent pairs [4,10,11,22].
Although several cases in yeast have shown functional
associations for conserved divergent pairs [8,12], a higher
co-expression level in divergent pairs could not be
detected when compared to tandem pairs [20]. Consistent
with this finding, we found no difference in the co-expression level among three adjacency patterns for the stringently conserved group, supporting the observation of
neutrality in adjacency types. In addition, we found the
co-expression levels of conserved adjacent pairs and nonconserved adjacent pairs to be approximately the same in
yeast, indicating that the adjacent relationship of coexpressed pairs is free from selection constraint in yeast. It
seems that a bias toward divergent gene organization is
only observed in the lineage leading to mammals [22]. If
this is true, a possible explanation is that the mechanisms
concerning the co-expression of adjacent pairs in yeast are
different from those in mammals. For example, mechanisms such as sharing of cis-regulatory elements and antisense transcription, both of which explained the coexpression of human adjacent genes [5,25], are actually
rare in yeast genome [26,27].
Low ratio of sharing common TFs in adjacent pairs
It has been suggested that when adjacent yeast genes are
controlled by a single regulatory system, their expression
patterns should be highly correlated [12,20]. In order to
investigate whether shared TFs in adjacent pairs are
responsible for the co-expression, we collected the TF
information from adjacent pairs of S. cerevisiae for further
analysis. Surprisingly, the ratio of adjacent pairs with
shared TFs is low (about 12%). A similar trend is observed
when the dataset is separated into conserved and nonconserved adjacent pairs, indicating that such feature is
not particularly favored by selection. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that co-expression of adjacent pairs in
yeast does not merely result from sharing the TF-based
regulatory system. This is also contrary to the findings that
in human a high proportion of the adjacent pairs share a
regulatory system which consequently drives co-expression of neighboring genes [11,22].

A case study from the co-expression of PAC and RRPE
It is commonly believed that genes with the same regulators have similar expression profiles. However, we
observed that the co-expression level of TF-sharing adjacent pairs is not higher than that of those without common TFs. We performed a case study on PAC and RRPE,
two combinatorial cis-acting sequences whose target genes
are expected to display high levels of co-expression. But
our analysis showed the contrary that only 6 out of 22
divergent pairs had similar expression profile, and 72%
(16 out of 22) of the divergent pairs are not co-expressed.
Furthermore, the six co-expressed divergent pairs appear
to have independent cis-regulatory elements. These results
suggest that the shared regulatory system of adjacent
genes in S. cerevisiae is not highly relevant to their coexpression.

Considering the low prevalence of sharing TFs and the
lack of selection constraint on adjacency of adjacent pairs,
one possible explanation for the co-expression phenomenon is chromatin modifications [3,15,29]. Mechanisms
such as histone acetylation, deacetylation and DNA methylation, may contribute significantly to the co-expression
of neighboring genes in S. cerevisiae [25,28]. Detailed
analyses of transcription pattern as well as chromatin
structure of co-expressed genes are required to shed light
on the questions raised by this report.

Conclusion
The purpose of this study arose from speculating on the
impact that sharing of TFs might have on driving concurrent expression of adjacent gene pairs. We found that gene
adjacency was not strongly favored during yeast evolution. Furthermore, the analysis on co-expression in adjacent gene pairs and shared TFs showed an indistinct
relationship. Albeit the bias or noise potentially present in
microarray data, the clear result of the divergent pairs coregulated by PAC and RRPE led us to conclude that the
shared TFs can not fully explain the co-expression of divergent pairs.
In summary, our study does not refute the contribution of
commonly shared TFs to co-regulation of adjacent genes
in yeast, but our finding does suggest that TF sharing is not
the sole determinant of such regulation. We believe that
during evolution yeasts have developed a sophisticated
regulatory system which integrates both TF-based and
non-TF based mechanisms(s), of which the latter may
account for a greater extent in driving co-expression of
neighboring genes. This integrative regulatory system
allows yeasts to simultaneously modulate expression of
neighboring genes in order to adapt to changing environments rapidly and efficiently.

Methods
Identification of orthologous adjacent pairs in five yeast
species
The genome sequences and annotations of five yeast species (including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces castellii, Saccharomyces bayanus, Saccharomyces kudriavzevvi
and Saccharomyces mikatae) were downloaded from Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD, http://www.yeast
genome.org). There were 6310, 4681, 4970, 3778, and
3109 annotated ORFs from these genomes, respectively.
Gene pairs in S. cerevisiae were identified by their relative
position in the genome. Dubious and silent ORFs were
excluded from analysis. Overlapping genes were also
removed because they might have biased the expression
analysis. Finally a total of 5743 genes of S. cerevisiae were
used for analysis. Based on the positional annotation in
SGD they were categorized into groups of divergent pairs,
convergent pairs and tandem pairs, adding up to 5702
adjacent pairs detected in S. cerevisiae.

Using S. cerevisiae as the reference genome, orthologous
ORFs were identified in S. castellii (3857), S. bayanus
(4642), S. kudriavzevvi (3212), and S. mikatae (2435)
(Table 1). Except for S. cerevisiae, we determined adjacent
pairs for the remaining four yeast species by mapping all
the ORFs to their contigs according to the annotated
sequences. The ORFs within the same contigs were sorted
based on their hit positions. Adjacent relationship was
then designated by their relative positions and orientations annotated in SGD. We identified 2053, 3975, 2376,
and 1609 orthologous adjacent pairs in S. castellii, S. bayanus, S. kudriavzevvi, and S. mikatae, respectively. (Table 1)
We considered an adjacent pair conserved if the neighboring ORFs were orthologues of adjacent genes in S. cerevisiae and meanwhile retained the same orientation
pattern. If one (or both) genes of an adjacent pair in S. cerevisiae were missing or the pairing orientation was different in other species, the pair was ascribed to the nonconserved group. The conserved pairs were then classified
into stringently conserved and loosely conserved groups
according to their degree of conservation. An adjacent pair
was considered stringently conserved if the adjacent relationship was preserved in all five yeast species. The loosely
conserved group refers to the pairs that have an adjacent
relationship preserved in any three of the five yeast species, or preserved in S. castellii and one another of the four
yeast species. This is because that S. castellii is the most distantly related species among the five, and the chance of
convergent evolution is remote. As a result, there were 345
stringently conserved pairs and 3,582 loosely conserved
pairs. Among those, there were 94, 95, and 156 stringently
conserved pairs and 942, 973, and 1,667 loosely conserved pairs for the divergent, convergent, and tandem
categories, respectively.

To compare the preserved patterns among these five yeast
species, the relative ratios of three adjacent patterns were
analyzed by chi-square test using a random sampling as
reference (0.25 : 0.25 : 0.5) (Table 1).
Evaluation of the expression correlation between
conserved adjacent pairs
We selected four S. cerevisiae microarray datasets for the
expression analysis, including alpha [30], cdc [30], crz1p
[31], and env [32]. Both the alpha and cdc datasets are time
course expression profiles encompassing two to three cell
cycles after release from growth arrest. The alpha data were
obtained from cells treated with alpha-factor transiently,
and the cdc data was collected from a cdc15-2 temperature
sensitive mutant which resumed growth after release from
heat shock. For the crz1p dataset, yeast cells were triggered
for ionic signaling by either calcium (Ca2+) or sodium
(Na+). The env dataset contains expression profiles of
yeast cells exposed to diverse environmental perturbations. Each array was normalized so that the log ratios had
a mean of zero. To avoid potential discrepancy between
arrays due to factors specific to each condition, we merged
these four array data into one large dataset and used the
Pearson coefficient to calculate the co-expression level for
each adjacent pair.

To investigate whether conserved adjacent pairs had a
higher tendency to be co-expressed, we compared for the
conserved group the expression correlations of divergent
pairs, convergent pairs, and tandem pairs to those of a
group of 5,000 non-adjacent random pairs. We used the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test to examine whether two
groups of gene pairs were co-expressed to different
extents. The KS test is a nonparametric test which determines if two distributions differ significantly. The KS test
calculates the maximum vertical deviation (D) between
the empirical distribution functions of the two groups to
determine whether the two datasets are drawn from the
same distribution. Let x be the expression correlation of
an ORF pair over all experimental points. Let fi(x) be the
density function of x for the gene pairs in group i, and
Fi(x) be the function of corresponding cumulative distribution. For groups i and j, if the statistic D is significantly
large, we infer that the two groups of gene pairs are from
two distinct distributions and are expressed differentially.
Similarly, we used the KS test to examine the significance
of the differences between conserved adjacent pairs and
non-conserved adjacent pairs.
Identification of transcription factors shared among
adjacent pairs
To understand whether co-expression of adjacent pairs is
mainly due to sharing of the same regulatory system, we
studied the correlation of co-expression level to the presence and the number of commonly shared TFs. We col-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/352

lected the TF information from MYBS [24], a web-based
service that identifies TFBSs with comprehensive annotation. MYBS integrates an array of predicted and known
transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) with a calculated
position weight matrix (PWMs) and incorporates DNAbinding affinity data from chromatin-immunoprecipitation microarray experiments (ChIP-chip) as well as the
phylogenetic footprinting data of TFBSs from eight related
yeast species.
In this study, we considered a TF to regulate a gene if: 1)
its binding to the gene was supported by a p-value less
than 0.01 in the ChIP-chip experiment; 2) there existed a
short sequence pattern satisfying the PWM's threshold;
and 3) the sequence pattern was conserved in at least one
of the four Saccharomyces sensu stricto species.
For more detailed comparison, we classified the adjacent
pairs into three groups of pairs without shared TFs, pairs
with one TF in common, and pairs with multiple TFs in
common. Again, we used the KS test to examine whether
shared TFs were relevant to the co-expression level
between the pair.
