Abstract
Background: Human infection by the pork tapeworm Taenia solium affects more than 50 million people worldwide,
particularly in underdeveloped and developing countries. Cysticercosis which arises from larval encystation can be life
threatening and difficult to treat. Here, we investigate for the first time the transcriptome of the clinically relevant
cysticerci larval form.
Results: Using Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) produced by the ORESTES method, a total of 1,520 high quality ESTs
were generated from 20 ORESTES cDNA mini-libraries and its analysis revealed fragments of genes with promising
applications including 51 ESTs matching antigens previously described in other species, as well as 113 sequences
representing proteins with potential extracellular localization, with obvious applications for immune-diagnosis or vaccine
development.

Conclusion: The set of sequences described here will contribute to deciphering the expression profile of this important
parasite and will be informative for the genome assembly and annotation, as well as for studies of intra- and inter-specific
sequence variability. Genes of interest for developing new diagnostic and therapeutic tools are described and discussed.

Background
Taenia solium, the pork tapeworm, infects around 50 million people worldwide and is one of the foremost public
health problems in developing countries [1,2]. The high
influx and immigration of people coming from endemic
areas to more industrialized nations has produced a complex spreading pattern for cysticercosis which is now a
world-wide issue [2].
Cystercercosis arises from the development of T. solium
cysticerci in soft tissues as a result of ingesting T. solium
eggs [3-5]. Neurocysticercosis; which can cause epileptiform attacks, headaches, learning difficulties and convulsions; is considered the primary cause of acquired epilepsy
and its clinical/therapeutic management is difficult, highlighting the importance of search for new drug targets [68]. In this work, we investigate for the first time the gene
expression profile of T. solium in the larval form responsible – the cysticerci.
High throughput sequencing for gene discovery and gene
expression profiling using traditional [9] or alternative
'Expressed Sequence Tags' (ESTs) such as 'Open Reading
Frame ESTs' (ORESTES) [10,11] has greatly increased our
knowledge of the set of expressed genes of some important helminthic parasites, notably Schistosoma mansoni
[12,13] and its intermediate vector Biomphalaria glabrata
[14], S. japonicum [15] and the cestodes Echinococcus granulosus [16], E. multilocularis [17] and Mesocestoides corti
[18].
Recently, Aguilar-Díaz et al. [1] described the T. solium
genome initiative designed to unravel the parasite's complete genome. The availability of transcribed sequences,
such as those presented here, will be key to the facilitate
genome annotation and gene discovery in T. solium.

Results
Here we present the sequencing and analysis of 2,857
ORESTES derived from T. solium cysticerci, revealing a
fraction of the parasite transcriptome. A total of 1,520
high-quality ORESTES generated here were deposited in
dbEST database of GenBank http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/dbEST, being 1,180 annotated as from T. solium
to
EX151133
and
Gen[GenBank:EX150322
Bank:FD661301 to FD661668] and 340 corresponding to
to
pig-derived
sequences
[GenBank:EX151134
EX151473]. These sequences are also available at the
STINGRAY system on the BiowebDB consortium website

http://stingray.biowebdb.org/, together with relevant
annotations and additional files. A list of the T. solium
ORESTES and their respective GenBank accession numbers is presented on the Additional file 1.
General Features
A general overview of the T. solium ESTs generated here is
presented in Table 1. More detailed analysis of the parasite
transcriptome, such as codon usage and G+C content, can
be obtained online at the STINGRAY system http://sting
ray.biowebdb.org/index.cgi?project=TS.

A total of 2,857 clones were sequenced and, after removal
of poor quality (Phred<15 and/or less than 100 bp) and
less informative sequences (typically rRNA and mtRNA),
the remaining 1,520 ORESTES were used for sequence
assembly following detailed analysis by the STINGRAY.
After assembling, sequences were arranged into distinct
sets named 'Cysticerci' and 'Cysticerci PIGS', which are
available at STINGRAY.
The 'Cysticerci' project http://stingray.biowebdb.org/
index.cgi?project=TS corresponds to the parasite-derived
transcriptome and contains a total of 1,180 ESTs clustered
in 812 non-redundant sequences (185 clusters + 627 singlets), with an average size of 355 nt, totaling 288,496 nt.
The 'Cysticerci PIGS' dataset http://stingray.bio
webdb.org/index.cgi?project=TP was determined on the

basis of blast similarity analysis with high scores against
genomic sequences of S. scrofa. It is composed of 340 nonredundant singlets with an average size of 390 nt and
about 132,000 nt in total. The stringency criterion used
here warrants that most of this subset is certainly composed of the host transcripts, which may include transcripts relevant for the host-parasite interaction.
The parasite transcriptome
Among the parasite's 812 non-redundant sequences (627
singlets + 185 clusters), 462 yielded significant hits with at
least one of the databases used for comparative analysis
http://stingray.biowebdb.org/index.cgi?project=TS. From
these sequences with significant hits, 204 showed similarity with sequences of parasitic metazoan species, including sequences from the T. solium Genome Project (84),
from other Taenia species such as T. saginata (2), T. crassiceps (2), T. asiatica (1), as well from other parasitic cestodes as E. granulosus (7) and E. multilocularis (4). Hits
were also found against sequences from platyhelminths
such as S. mansoni (88), S. japonicum (11), Clonorchis sinensis (1) and Fasciola hepatica (6). The remaining 263
sequences showed similarity with other metazoan species
(see Additional file 2). For 350 sequences no hits were
obtained on Blast, InterProScan or HMMER analyses.

After automated and manual annotation of all 812 nonredundant sequences, 191 were validated as coding
sequences (CDS) (Table 1), of which 60 were considered
hypothetical proteins or hypothetical conserved proteins.
The number of ORESTES sequences according to their
annotation identifiers is given in Additional file 3. As
expected, this dataset enriched for coding sequences and
showed a higher G+C content (53%) as compared to the
total dataset (49%) (Table 1).
Analysis of the 191 annotated sequences using Gene
Ontology (GO) allowed the categorization of 96
sequences, among which 84 were classified according to
molecular function, 65 to biological processes and 48 to
cellular component, several with multiple categories (Fig.
1). From the 65 sequences with biological processes annotation, the most frequent GO sub-categories were proteins
related to cellular processes (40), followed by metabolic
processes (10), biological regulation (4) and adhesion (4)
(Fig. 2A). Among the GO molecular function sub-categories, binding (34), catalytic activity (24), structural molecule activity (14) and motor activity (7) were the most
frequent (Fig. 2B). It is noteworthy that a relevant fraction
of the transcripts revealed here appear to be related to
structural aspects (such as adhesion, binding or structural
molecule activity) that might be involved with the solid
constitution of the cysts and their establishment on host
tissues (see Additional file 4). A detailed description of

http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/2/1/35

each GO sub-category can be found on the annotated
database available at the STINGRAY system http://sting
ray.biowebdb.org/index.cgi?project=TS.
The search for predictive sub-cellular localization of the
products related to each annotated CDS was performed
using the Wolf-PSORT software [19] and returned 113
hits. Among the 13 sequences with predictions of having
extracellular localization with high scores (>25), only
seven have a putative function assigned by GO. Among
these, three are probably not extracellular ('40S Ribosomal protein S19' [GenBank:EX150987], 'Deoxyribonuclease I' [GenBank:EX151091], and 'Sec61-like protein'
[GenBank:EX150487]), two may have extracellular localization ('WD40 repeat' – [GenBank:EX150998] and 'Heatshock protein' [GenBank:EX151058]), while the 'TolA
protein' [GenBank:EX150587] and the 'Cadherin family
member (cdh-4)' [GenBank: EX150991] are probably
extracellular (see Additional file 5). Considering the WolfPSORT limitations in predicting cellular localization
based on short sequences such as ESTs and the fact that
none of the 113 proteins predicted as extracellular were
annotated as antigens, even though most Taenia sp. proteins already reported in the literature have precisely that
description, further analysis using full length sequences
are necessary to confirm these results.
Conserved Domains and Motifs
The search for protein motifs among the parasite
sequences was performed by similarity searches using
InterProScan and RPSBlast using all databases available
on the STINGRAY system and pointed out 64 distinct
motifs distributed in 79 non-redundant sequences (see
Additional files 6, 7 and 8). Among these, the 'pistil-specific extensin-like protein motif' [GenBank:IPR003882]
was observed in 16 sequences, the 'vinculin/alpha-catenin' [GenBank:IPR006077] in 12, the 'glutelin' [GenBank:IPR000480] in six, 'fibronectin type III-like fold'
[GenBank:IPR008957] in five and several others with four
or less hits. Detailed categorization of the T. solium
sequences according to the Eukaryotic Orthologous
Groups (KOG) categories is shown on the Additional file
9.

A sensitive search for protein family recognition using
multiple alignments was carried out with HMMER software and revealed 92 sequences of our parasite dataset
generating at least one hit with the Pfam HMM profiles
library. A domain with a still unknown function
(DUF1787) was found in 12 sequences, the 'PT-PT repeat'
in another nine sequences, the 'Hsp20/alpha crystallin
family' (HSP20) and the 'I-set-immunoglobulin' (I-set
domains) in four, the 'spectrin repeat' (SPECTRIN) and
'EGF-EGF-like domains' in another three sequences.

species and received distinct names such as EM10, EG10,
EM4 and antigen II/3, despite their high nucleotide similarity. In E. granulosus and E. multilocularis these antigens
are basically found in the germinal layer of brood capsules
and in the tegument of protoscolices, associated with larval stage. Gonzales et al. 2007 [20], showed that the TEGTsag gene of T. saginata is homologous to EM10 and EG10
genes of Echinococcus spp. and 97% identical to its T.
solium homologue. However, alignment of this T. solium
gene with the two clusters sequences described in the
present study [GenBank:EX151048, GenBank:EX151014]
clearly showed high sequence variability, despite the conserved blocks. The TEG molecules are characterized by an
N-terminal FERM domain and a C-terminal ERM domain
which are found in a number of cytoskeletal-associated
proteins located at the interface between the plasma
membrane and the cytoskeleton and in proteins interacting with lipid membranes. Thus TEG protein may play a
role in tegument function and interaction with the host.

Comparisons with taeniid sequences
Only 117 of the 812 T. solium cysticerci clustered
sequences described in the present study revealed similarity with the T. solium Genome Project ESTs available at
GenBank. Among these 117 sequences, 107 showed similarity on tblastx and 100 on blastn analysis with ESTs of
the T. solium Genome Project, 39 with exclusive hits to the
larval stage sequence, 11 with the adult stage and 67 with
genes expressed in both life-cycle stages (see Additional
file 10).

Except for nine sequences from Taenia sp. or Echinococcus
sp., the remaining cestode-related sequences presenting
high score (>90) on blast against the T. solium sequences
described in this study, were from Mesocestoides corti (heat
shock 70 kDa protein) and from Diphyllobothrium dendriticum (actin). Further 36 low-score (<90) hits with the 28S
ribosomal RNA from distinct cestode species were
observed.
Comparative analysis against E. granulosus sequences from
GenBank mainly revealed constitutive genes such as actin,
paramyosin and others metabolic enzymes. However, two
GenBank:EX151014]
clusters
[GenBank:EX151048,
showed high similarity with genes coding for ERM family
proteins (ezrin, radixin, moesin), exclusively with EST
from larval stage of T. solium (see Additional files 6 and 8).
Some of these proteins were characterized in Echinococcus

Genes of interest
A number of transcripts identified here could be of interest for further study (see Additional file 11). At least 30
genes coding for proteins potentially involved in parasite
development, including transcriptional factors, component of chromatin remodelling complexes, cell adhesionrelated molecules, receptors and other transducing components of signalling pathways have been identified.
Moreover, putative orthologues of two proteins possibly
associated to invertebrate immunity were identified for
the first time in T. solium cysticerci: a 'heat shock 90 kDa
protein' [GenBank:EX150676] and an 'anaphylatoxin-like
domain
protein'
[GenBank:EX150322,
GenBank:EX150873].

Fifty-one T. solium ORESTES revealed similarity with
known antigens, including five previously characterized
helminth antigens with potential for development of
immunodiagnostic and/or vaccines. These are 'paramyosin' [GenBank:EL745866, GenBank:EL750686, GenBank:EL762552], 'major egg antigen' [GenBank:
EL740635, GenBank:EL758824, GenBank:EL760346],
'cathepsin L-like cysteine proteinase' [GenBank:
EL742569], 'heat shock 70 kDa protein' [GenBank:
EL740975, GenBank:EL740984, GenBank:EL741400,
GenBank:
EL744338,
GenGenBank:EL744008,
GenBank:EL747548,
GenBank:
Bank:EL745376,
EL747588] and the 'H17g' or 'TEG-Tsol surface antigen'
[GenBank:AJ581299], which is highly conserved among
T. solium and T. saginata.

Discussion
Transcriptome investigations have greatly benefited from
the recent maturation of gene expression approaches.
Among these, the microarray has evolved as the most
prominent high-throughput method to assess a given

expression profile. However, they are still subjected to
hybridization issues such as reaction kinetics and probe
mismatches as former methods. Also, microarrays cannot
adequately address expression profiles of samples containing mixed species, which are yielded in studies of
most parasite interactions. In these situations, the use of
short gene tags, such as SAGE [21] is also problematic, due
to the ambiguous tag-to-gene assignment and the difficulties of gene identification, especially in situations when
the genome and/or the transcriptome of one of the species
is not available. By comparison, the generation of longer
sequence tags, such as those derived from EST or
ORESTES, can facilitate gene discovery and annotation
and also provides a much less ambiguous tag-to-gene
mapping.
As formerly shown, ORESTES is able to give a normalized
transcriptome view, as well as to characterize sequences
from the central portion of the genes, including the lessabundant transcript markers [10,11,22-24]. The normalization capability of ORESTES, together with its ability to
sample the central portion of genes makes this approach
complementary to traditional ESTs, more frequently used
in large-scale cDNA sequencing projects. Thus, as we have
shown before for other species, including humans [11], S.
mansoni [12,13], Drosophila melanogaster [25] or Apis melifera [26], ORESTES provides a distinct contribution to gene
discover in T. solium. The present study shows the first
comparative sequence analysis of the T. solium transcriptome using ORESTES from the larval stage (cysticerci).
Comparison of the T. solium ORESTES generated in this
study with all T. saginata and T. solium sequences retrieved
from GenBank showed identical hits with both datasets,
indicating a high level of conservation in genes like 'Tsp36
small heat shock protein'. Few hits were obtained from
other taeniids (T. crassiceps and T. asiatica), which may be
due to their small sequence datasets or to the higher distance from T. solium and these other species. As an example of such intra-genus variability, T. asiatica is
morphologically similar to T. saginata occurring in almost
all Asian countries being capable of infecting pigs and
humans [27] possibly leading to cysticercosis, but
unlikely neurocysticercosis [28].
Since only 119 of the T. solium sequences described in this
work showed similarity to T. solium Genome Project
sequences, our results significantly contribute to the
knowledge of the parasite expression profile by increasing
the number of sequenced transcripts and through functional annotation of several genes. Thus, the present
report is complementary to the T. solium genome initiative
and may be helpful on the parasite genome assembly and
annotation [29], as well as on studies of intra- and interspecific sequence variability.

http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/2/1/35

Considering the overall picture of the T. solium cysticerci
transcriptome presented in this work, comparative
sequence analysis revealed 350 sequences (43%) producing hits with a database. Despite the small dataset, it is
interesting to note that Aguilar-Diaz et al. [1] found a very
similar picture in the analysis of the transcriptome of
adult worms, with 40% of the genes showing no hits. A
systematic, functional investigation of these unknown
genes using postgenomic tools such as "gene knockout"
or RNA-mediated "knockdown" is desirable.
Several protein domains related to cell structure, including cell wall organization, were found among the generated sequences. The pistil-specific extensin-like and the
vinculin/alpha-catenin motifs found in this study are of
special interest due their role in cell wall structure and
interaction. According to Interpro, the pistil-specific
extensin-like protein motif [Interpro:IPR003882] is frequently found in the cell-wall proteins of many plants,
and can account for up to 20% of their dry weight. Interestingly, this motif is also found in metazoans like Brugia
malayi [Interpro:A8Q5T0/A8QDB8] and C. elegans [Interpro:Q20327]. Since extensin-like proteins in plants are
involved in cell wall strengthening in response to
mechanical stress, such as attack by pests or plant-bending
in the wind, it is reasonable to hypothesize a similar role
on the T. solium cysts walls, conferring rigidity with a possible role in parasite defense.
The vinculin and/or alpha-catenin are eukaryotic actinbinding protein motifs, usually containing proline-rich
motifs and several ligand-biding motifs. Vinculins are frequently used as markers for cell-cell and cell-extracellular
matrix junctions, named as focal adhesions, also interacting with other structural proteins such as talin and alphaactinins [30]. It is tempting to speculate that proteins containing these motifs may have a function on the organization of the cysticerci wall as well as on the interaction with
host's tissues.
Oxidative and other types of stress are inherent to the host
environment to which a parasite is exposed. Therefore,
proteins that allow the cysticerci to cope with stress may
be important in infection maintenance. In this study several heat shock proteins (hsp16, hsp20, hsp25, hsp70,
hsp86, and hsp90) and other stress response-related proteins have been identified as being transcribed by this
developmental stage. Previous studies with T. solium cysticerci showed that the expression of 70 and 80 kDa heat
shock proteins was highly induced under temperature
stress [31]. Recently, another heat shock protein of 35.4
kDa was described for T. solium cysticerci and points out
the importance of such proteins for the parasite life cycle
[32].

The host immune response to tissue parasitism is an
important aspect to the establishment and development
of the neurocysticercosis pathology. In this study, the
'heat shock 90 kDa' protein and the 'anaphylatoxin-like
domain' (a complement-associated protein in vertebrates) – which are described for the first time for the T.
solium cysticerci – have been associated to a possible
immune response in invertebrates [33,34] and along with
the host immunity may be involved on the host-parasite
immunological interplay.
Among several genes related to the antigenic coat of the
parasite, the TEG-Tsol gene is of major importance for
both immune diagnostic and vaccine development, due
to its high antigenicity, strong similarity (~97%) between
T. solium and T. saginata paralogs, conservation among
other taeniid species and reactivity to distinct animal sera
[20]. TEG-Tsol was found among the ORESTES in the
present study and corresponds to the major protoscolex
surface antigen detected in E. granulosus (EG10) and E.
multilocularis (EM10) [35], which is also expressed in the
oncospheres and on adult tapeworm tegument of both T.
solium and T. saginata, as well as on the tegument of the T.
solium cysticerci [36-38].
Despite some encouraging results on vaccine development [39-41], several studies have pointed out intra- and
inter-specific variability of taeniid species at both genotypic and phenotypic levels [26,42-50], which may represent a problem for the global-scale use of single- or multiantigen recombinant vaccines. Thus, genome and transcriptome sequences – especially when derived from parasites collected at different endemic areas – are of major
importance to address such variability and to point new
vaccine and diagnostic/prognostic candidate markers. In
this context, differently from genomic markers, ESTs are
powerful tools not only to indicate potentially relevant
candidates, but also to provide experimental evidence of
expression specific developmental stages.

Conclusion
The sequencing effort presented here is complementary to
the T. solium Genome Project, having described several
unknown genes for this species, which may have direct
and immediate applications on diagnosis, therapeutics
and/or vaccine development. Furthermore, this database
represents part of a key resource to understanding aspects
of the cysticerci biology and host/parasite interaction.
Considering the ongoing efforts to sequence the hydatid
disease agents (E. granulosus and E. multilocularis) along
with the T. solium Genome Project [1,28], we hope our
results can contribute to the development of comparative
parasitic metazoan genomics, yielding new molecular
diagnosis targets [51] and new insights into the pathogenesis of cysticercosis and taeniasis.

Taenia solium cysticerci were collected from a naturally
infected, landrace, bred pig (Sus scrofa). The animal was
humanely sacrificed and cysticerci, spontaneously
detached from abdominal and thoracic muscles were
recovered and carefully micro-dissected to remove any tissue fragments that remained attached. Cysts were extensively washed with phosphate-buffered saline and
immediately stored at -80°C. The study was previously
approved by the Ethics Committee on Animal Research of
the Faculty of Animal Science and Food Engineering
(FZEA) of Universidade de São Paulo (USP), and was carried out following the institution's guidelines for animal
husbandry.
RNA extraction, RT-PCR and cDNA libraries preparation
Total RNA was obtained from cysticerci using the Trizol®
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad). Messenger RNA (mRNA) was
purified using the μMACs mRNA isolation kit (Miltenyi
Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach), following manufacturer's
directions, as described [52]. mRNA concentration was
evaluated by spectrophotometry (U-3010 Hitachi, Tokyo,
Japan) and 25 ng mRNA aliquots were frozen for the posterior generation of ORESTES amplification profiles as
described [12]. Briefly, cDNA was synthesized and amplified with some of the oligonucleotide primers previously
used in the S. mansoni transcriptome project [12]. Twenty
cDNA mini-libraries were constructed using ORESTES and
a set of different oligonucleotide primers (see Additional
file 12). The amplification profiles were evaluated in
ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels, cloned in pGEMT-Easy plasmids (Promega Corporation, Madison, USA)
and used for Escherichia coli (strain DH10β) transformation. Recombinant clones were obtained by selective
growth (X-Gal, IPTG and ampicillin), screened by PCR
amplification of the insert using primers pGEM-F (5'-ACG
CCA AGC TAT TTA GGT GAC ACT ATA-3') and EXCEL-R
(5'-GTT GTA AAA CGA CGG CCA GTG AAT-3') and stored
as glycerol stocks at -80°C. For sequencing, the bacterial
clones were grown in LB medium for 20 hours at 37°C,
followed by plasmid DNA extraction by alkaline lysis
according to standard protocols [53].
DNA sequencing and analysis
ORESTES sequencing was carried out by two laboratories
located at UFSC and USP using the DYEnamic® ET Dye
Terminator kit (GE Healthcare, Fairfield) or ThermoSequenase II dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Amersham-Pharmacia Biotech) in a MegaBace 1000® DNA
Analysis System (GE Healthcare) and on a ABI PRISM®
3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City),
respectively. Briefly, each sequencing reaction used 5
pmol of pGEM-F or EXCEL-R oligonucleotides, and PCR
products [54] or plasmid DNA as templates. The labeling

conditions were: 95°C/25 sec., 35 cycles of 95°C/15 sec.,
50°C/20 sec. and 60°C/90 sec. The products were then
precipitated (70% isopropanol), injected at 2 KV for 100
sec. and electrophoresed for 140 min. at 7 KV.
Sequence analysis was performed using the STINGRAY
system (System for Integrated Genomic Resources and
Analysis), an improved version of the formerly published
GARSA system (Genomic Analysis Resources for Sequence
Annotation) [55]. Briefly, the system workflow initially
performs evaluation of the quality of the obtained chromatograms (cut-off Phred ≥ 15) following removal of vector sequences through Phred and Cross-match [56,57]
and then clustering the sequences using CAP3 [58]. Following similarity searches performed by Blast (Basic Local
Alignment Tool), Psi-Blast (Position-Specific Integrated
Blast), RPSBlast (Reverse Position-specific Blast) [59],
InterProScan [60] and HMMER (Hidden Markov Models
for sequence profile analysis) [61] packages against local
pre-formatted databases, blast analysis was also performed using all EST sequences from the T. solium
Genome Project and the Sus scrofa genome available at
GenBank. After removal of ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
sequences, blast analysis against the Sus scrofa genome
was used to separate parasite sequences from host
sequences, creating two datasets that were evaluated separately. Functional annotation was performed using the
Gene Ontology (GO) vocabulary as described by Jones et
al. [62] and putative sub-cellular localization of each coding sequence was performed through the Wolf-PSORT
program [63]. The G+C content of singlets and clusters
was estimated by the GeeCee program (EMBOSS – European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite – package)
and the tRNA sequences were predicted by tRNAscan-SE
[64].
The results were then individually and manually checked
during annotation, when sequences were validated as
CDS when presenting i) high similarity values (e-value <
= e-15 and similarity>75%) with protein databases
(uniprot_swissprot,
uniprot_trembl,
uniref90,
refseq_protein) or with protein sequences from phylogenetically related organisms (Cestoda and/or Trematoda)
available on GenBank, ii) the presence of conserved
domains as revealed by RPS-Blast against CDD (see Additional file 6), COG (see Additional file 7) and KOG databases (see Additional file 8); iii) the presence of protein
domains as revealed by InterProScan and HMMER and iv)
annotations on Gene Ontology analysis, when available.
T. solium sequences having no protein domain and showing exclusive hits with high similarity values (e-value < =
e-15 and similarity>75%) with 'hypothetical proteins' or
'hypothetical conserved proteins' from GenBank were
annotated accordingly.
