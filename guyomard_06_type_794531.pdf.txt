Abstract
Background: The development of large genomic resources has become a prerequisite to elucidate the
wide-scale evolution of genomes and the molecular basis of complex traits. Linkage maps represent a first
level of integration and utilization of such resources and the primary framework for molecular analyses of
quantitative traits. Previously published linkage maps have already outlined the main peculiarities of the
rainbow trout meiosis and a correspondance between linkage groups and chromosome arms has been
recently established using fluorescent in situ hybridization. The number of chromosome arms which were
covered by these maps remained unknown.
Results: We report an updated linkage map based on segregation analysis of more than nine hundred
microsatellite markers in two doubled haploid gynogenetic lines. These markers segregated into 31 linkage
groups spanning an approximate total map length of 2750 cM. Centromeres were mapped for all the
linkage groups using meiogenetic lines. For each of the 31 linkage groups, the meta or acrocentric
structure infered from centromere mapping was identical with those recently found with fluorescent in
situ hybridization results. The present map is therefore assumed to cover the 52 chromosome arms which
constitute the rainbow trout karyotype. Our data confirm the occurrence of a high interference level in
this species. Homeologous regions were identified in eleven linkage groups, reflecting the tetraploid nature
of the salmonid genome. The data supported the assumption that gene orders are conserved between
duplicated groups and that each group is located on a single chromosome arm. Overall, a high congruence
with already published rainbow trout linkage maps was found for both gene syntenies and orders.
Conclusion: This new map is likely to cover the whole set of chromosome arms and should provide a
useful framework to integrate existing or forthcoming rainbow trout linkage maps and other genomic
resources. Since very large numbers of EST containing microsatellite sequences are available in databases,
it becomes feasible to construct high-density linkage maps localizing known genes. This will facilitate
comparative mapping and, eventually, identification of candidate genes in QTL studies.

Background
The development of genomic resources is a key step
towards further investigation of wide-scale genome evolution, identification and study of gene or gene networks
involved in complex characters. Such efforts have naturally focussed on genetic model systems and species of
applied biomedical or agronomical importance. In the
case of rainbow trout, genetic resources have been primarily developed in order to study the gene networks controlling the phenotype of traits that affect breeding
performances or fisheries sustainability and to identify
mutations responsible for the genetic variation of these
traits. However, the rainbow trout is also a suitable model
to investigate more academic scientific questions
(reviewed in [1]), such as the evolution of duplicated
genomes. Two genome duplications seem to have taken
place during the early evolution of vertebrates. Studies
based on Hox clusters in several ray-finned fishes and
recent comparative analyses of Takifugu and Tetraodon
genomes with the Human genome have supported the
view that a third whole genome duplication occurred in
the ray-finned fish lineage approximately 350 My ago [24]. The salmonid family has undergone an additional
fourth genome duplication [5,6] which occurred 25–100
My ago. Therefore, the salmonids offer the opportunity to
study evolution of duplicated genomes at much earlier
stages after a polyploidisation event.
The construction of linkage maps is a primary step
towards the description and understanding of the structure and evolution of whole genomes. In rainbow trout,
several linkage maps based on segregations at AFLP and
microsatellite loci have been already published [7-11] and
successfully used to map QTL for growth, disease susceptibility, thermal tolerance, early development [12-16] or
to study the duplicated status and chromosomal localisation of gene families playing critical roles in major functions [17-20].
These linkage maps have allowed to ascertain several
important features of the meiosis and genome structure in
the rainbow trout. Briefly, female maps are three to four
times longer than male ones on the average, while telomeric regions show higher average recombination rate in
male than in female [10]. Several homeologous regions
sharing homology due to the recent tetraploidisation
event were identified. Some of these homeologous
regions exhibited pseudolinkage [10]. Pseudolinkage
refers to a non-random segregation of homeologous
regions which results from preferential pairing and alternate disjunction of homeologous regions inherited from
the same grand parent. It occurs in males only [21].
The current consensus linkage map consists of 31 major
linkage group [8,9]. Since the diploid chromosome

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/302

number in the rainbow trout ranges from 58 to 64 chromosomes due to a wide range of Robertsonian polymorphism [22], this number falls within the range of expected
linkage group numbers. More recently, the rainbow trout
genetic linkage groups have been assigned to specific
chromosomes using fluorescent in situ hybridisation of
BACs [23].
In this article, we report a new rainbow trout map. The
main objective was to cover all the chromosomes arms.
This information is of importance in rainbow trout since,
due to Robertsonian polymorphism, the number of chromosomes and, therefore, of independent linkage groups
can vary among families while the number of chromosomes arms are the constant basic characteristic of the
rainbow trout karyotype. The construction of the map was
based on segregation analysis of nearly one thousand microsatellite markers in two doubled haploid lines, which
are currently used in our laboratory. A particular effort was
made to map the centromere of each linkage group using
meiogynogenetic progeny in order to determine the acrocentric or metacentric structure of each linkage group.
Finally, since approximately one third of the mapped microsatellites originated from ESTs sequences, we attempted
to recover conserved syntenies between rainbow trout and
zebrafish by comparing the map localisation of homologous sequences in the two species.

Results
Number of informative loci
Out of 1321 microsatellite primer pairs tested, 168 did
not give any amplification at two annealing temperatures
(58 and 52°C) and 366 were monomorphic in the test
sample and 796 were informative in one family at least.
Three hundred and eighty-nine microsatellite primer pairs
were designed from EST sequences. Eighty primer pairs
originated from USDA EST sequences, of which eight have
been already mapped [7]. The annealing temperature was
58°C for all the informative markers. The 309 markers
developed from the SIGENAE-EST database were numbered Omy1009INRA to Omy1513INRA. All these markers including sequence, primer sequences, and PCR
conditions were submitted to the STS database in GenBank and assigned accession numbers BV681317 through
BV681637. One hundred and five primer pairs amplified
duplicated loci. The two female founders of INRA1 and
INRA2 were heterozygous for one SNP at BX087958 and
only the female parent of INRA1 at BX087759. A total
number of 903 loci, including the two SNPs, were informative for the segregation analysis.
Number of linkage groups
The comprehensive composite map was obtained by
merging the data sets from the two DH families (see Fig-

ures 1, 2, 3, 4). This map consisted of 31 linkage groups
and one unassigned marker. Correspondences with previous linkage map [8,9] and with specific chromosomes
based on FISH results [23] are given (see Additional file
1). RT28 identified in [8] was merged with RT8 here (two
unduplicated loci in common). In this study, linkage
group RT2 consisted of two unlinked fragments, RT2A
and RT2B. Family specific maps consisted of 32 and 35
linkage groups in INRA1 and INRA2 respectively. Four
linkage groups (RT6, RT8, RT15 and RT20) consisted of
two unlinked fragments in family INRA1 and only one in
family INRA2. Similarly, two unlinked fragments were
found in family INRA2 for linkage group RT7 instead of
one in INRA1. As expected, no significant pseudolinkage
was found in female meiosis.
Centromere mapping and arm numbers of linkage groups
Two to 9 loci per linkage group were mapped in the meiogenetic line (see Figures 1, 2, 3, 4). In all cases, the marker
orders obtained for a minimal number of recombination
events were identical to the ones found in the two mapping families. For twenty linkage groups (RT3, RT5 to
RT10, RT12, RT14 to RT16, RT19 to RT24, RT27, RT29 and
RT31; see Figures 1, 2, 3, 4), the loci showing less recombination were found within the linkage group and these
groups were assumed to have a metacentric structure.
These groups exhibited the highest numbers of double
crossovers and almost all of the triple C.O. and quadruple
C.O. events found in INRA1 and INRA2 families (see
Additional file 1). Double crossover numbers ranged from
13 in RT24 to 38 in RT31 while the other linkage groups
had 3 double crossovers or less, with the exception of linkage group RT17 (see below). Altogether, these figures were
in agreement with the hypothesis of high interference generally assumed in salmonids and the occurrence of one
chiasma per arm in most cases at meiosis I [24,25]. Under
this hypothesis, metacentric chromosomes are expected to
show mostly zero, one or two crossovers while acrocentric
ones mostly zero or one. For each metacentric group, the
distribution of the position of the recombination events
across all the individuals of INRA1 and INRA2 allowed to
determine the positions which minimized the number of
double recombinants on each arm. These position delimited putative centromere intervals which were consistent
with those of the half-tetrad analysis performed in meiogenetics and sometimes suggested a more precise localisation of centromeres (see Figures 1, 2, 3, 4). These 20
metacentric groups allowed to identify 40 chromosome
arms, out of 52. The segregation data in the meiogenetic
progeny resulted in the localisation of the centromere at
one extremity for the remaining linkage groups and led to
the identification of only 11 arms instead of 12. Since
RT2A, RT2B, on one hand and RT4 and RT25, were tightly
linked and formed metacentric groups in the meiogenetic
family, these four linkage groups were likely to be acro-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/302

centric in INRA1 and 2. RT1 which corresponds to the
chromosome bearing the Sex determinant [8,9] is also
stated to be acrocentric or subtelocentric [22]. Among the
six remaining linkage groups, RT17 which showed a relatively large number of double crossovers in both INRA1
and 2 families (see Additional file 1) and which was 87
cM in length, emerged as a possible metacentric group.
Duplicated regions
The 105 duplicated markers were distributed over a total
of 27 linkage groups (Table 1). Four linkage groups did
not show any duplicated loci and eleven linkage groups
shared homologies with two or more different linkage
groups (up to four). Twenty-two putative homologous
segments were found. Ten of these segment homologies
were based on co-localisation of multiple duplicates. One
linkage group, RT9, shared homologies with RT2B and
RT24 while RT2A shared homology with RT29. The localization of the centromeres was compatible with the
assumption that each duplicated region was located on a
single chromosome arm (see Figures 1, 2, 3, 4) with the
exception of RT3/RT25. These two groups shared three
duplicated loci which encompassed the centromeric
region of the metacentric RT3 linkage group. Marker
orders and orientation with respect to the centromere
were conserved between duplicated regions, provided that
modifications in the order of very few markers were introduced in the comprehensive map.
Map length and genome coverage
The map length estimated by the sum of recombination
percentage between adjacent markers was 2750 cM and
was slightly lower than the value obtained with the
Kosambi distance as mapping function (2773 cM). This
small difference probably reflected the fact that very few
multiple crossovers per arm were detected despite the
rather large average number of markers per group (see
Additional file 1). Assuming that the centromere positions lied within the intervals proposed (see Figures 1, 2,
3, 4), the total number of multiple C.O. events per arm
observed in these two families was estimated to 79 only
for a total number of 2975 recombination events. In the
meiogenetic family, all genotypes leading to double
recombinants per arm were re-genotyped. Only six cases
of double crossovers per arm out of a total observed
number of 2041 crossovers were found. Double crossovers per arm were not found in a majority of linkage
groups even over long map distances since up to 100 %
heterozygous progenies were found at distal loci. These
finding also supported the hypothesis of high to nearcomplete interference.
Comparative mapping with zebrafish
The comparison of 369 rainbow trout EST to the transcript
sequences of the zebrafish with BLASTn resulted in 49 hits

with e-values < 10-5. The assignment of the corresponding
loci to the linkage groups of each species and the conserved syntenies are reported in Table 2. These loci covered 21 linkage groups in zebrafish and ten of them
housed two or more loci. In all cases, zebrafish linkage
groups showed putative homologies with more than one
rainbow trout linkage group, irrespective of the duplication in this species. Six syntenies were conserved. In both
species, two of them involved two tightly linked loci

and
Omy1069INRA/
Omy1125INRA) while the four other ones emcompassed
large gene distances. It is noteworthy that RT9 and RT2B
appeared as a mosaic of non adjacent fragments of the
Zebrafish linkage group 3 and that, in zebrafish linkage
group 19, the synteny with RT3 was interrupted by a synteny with RT23 (Table 2). A tentative functional annotation of the EST-based microsatellites localised on the map
was performed (see Additional file 2). Strong to weak similarities with identified genes were found for 126 of them.

Discussion
Number of chromosome arms and genome coverage
The primary objective of this work was to obtain a map
covering all the chromosomes arms of the rainbow trout
karyotype. The map reported here was based on more

than 900 markers and consisted of 31 linkage groups.
Analyses of segregation data in both and DH families
allowed us to recognize 21 metacentric (with the inclusion of RT17) and ten acrocentric groups. It is noteworthy
that our classification was fully supported by a recent Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization study [23] which reported
the same acro or metacentric structure for each linkage
group in rainbow trout (see Additional file 1). Therefore,
with respect to our results and the conclusion of the FISH
experiments, it can be reasonably assumed that our map
covers the 52 chromosome arms which constitute the
rainbow trout karyotype.
Our results, both in the mapping families and in the
meiogenetic line, were highly consistent with the finding
of high interference in salmonid meiosis ([24,25]). Nearcomplete interference would be the more likely explanation for the absence of multiple recombinants per arm for
some linkage groups and the 100% heterozygous progenies for some loci in the meiogenetic family [24,25]. If
complete interference is assumed, the length of a linkage
group can be estimated by the percentage of recombinants. In most cases, linkage group lengths were close to
the expected ones under a complete interference model,
i.e. 50 cM for acrocentric groups and 100 cM for metacen-

tric ones in one family at least. Two groups, namely RT2A,
RT4 and one arm on RT8, RT17 and RT24, were substantially shorter than 50 cM. The coverage of these groups
could be readily improved by integration of additional
markers from the microsatellite already published [8,9] or
forthcoming linkage maps. Overall, the total map length
reported here was rather close to the expected rainbow
trout genome length of 2600 cM under complete interference (52 arms × 50 cM). This suggests that the present
linkage map provides a good coverage of the rainbow
trout genome.
Four linkage groups in INRA1 (RT6, RT8, RT15 and RT20)
and one in INRA2 (RT7) were composed of two unlinked
fragment. This could reflect a Robertsonian polymorphism or, alternatively, an insufficient local coverage of
the linkage group in one family. In the case of a Robertsonian polymorphism, the two unlinked fragments would
reflect the independence of the two acrocentric arms.
When considering two independent acrocentric chromosomes as a single metacentric one, 1/8 of the progeny is
expected to exhibit triple crossovers under complete interference: one crossover on each acrocentric group and one
recombinant due to the co-segregation of centromeres
from each grandparent. Since we did not find any convincing case of triple crossover at these linkage groups,
Robertsonian polymorphism is unlikely to explain the
occurrence of unlinked fragments in one of the family.
Note also that only two triple crossovers were found
instead of 15 (1/8 × 120 individuals) when RT2A and
RT2B are grouped, suggesting that these two fragments
could be linked in our DH families as in [8,9,23]
Assignment of each linkage group to a specific chromosome[23] will allow to replace the current linkage group
numbering by a nomenclature based on chromosome size
as in other species. The adoption of a definitive nomenclature will require a clear identification of all the chromosome arm associations involved in the Robertsonian
polymorphism in rainbow trout
Alignment with other rainbow trout maps and zebrafish
map
A total number of 214 microsatellite loci were common to
the female-specific maps published by [8] and this one.
Syntenies were not conserved for eight loci which mapped
to different linkage groups in each map. None of these
inconsistencies could be explained by a misinterpretation
of a homeology as a homology since the misassigned loci
did not map to homeologous regions. The 206 remaining
markers were correctly assigned to a total number of 23
linkage groups. The conservation of gene orders was
checked for 21 linkage groups which shared more than
two markers in the two maps. In most cases, inconsistencies in gene orders resulted from the unstable position of

one marker only or involved markers separated by short
distances. Only RT15 and RT27 showed important discrepancies. Despite the fact that four families were genotyped (two in this study and two in [8]), in all cases,
discrepancies in gene orders were detected in only two
families, the two others being uninformative with respect
to the order of the problematic markers. The correct order
in these groups remains to be validated. The two maps
were also congruent for the localisation of the centromeres. All the linkage groups which showed a centromere
in central position in the map of [8] were also stated as
being metacentric in our map.
One hundred and forteen microsatellite loci covering all
the linkage groups were common to the map of [9] and
ours. Only nine markers were not assigned to the same
group. Two discrepancies resulted from comparison of
homeologous loci. [9] map was a male-specific linkage
map obtained by genotyping androgenetic doubled haploid progeny. Therefore, most of the microsatellite markers clustered tightly in the centromeric regions as expected
in male and this map did not provide sufficient information on gene orders.
Overall, both syntenies and gene order appear to be conserved among the different linkage maps.
The localisation of type I marker on this map has provided
some evidences of conservation of syntenies between
zebrafish and rainbow trout, though it is not the rule. Of
particular interest are the alignment of zebrafish linkage
groups 3 and 19 on the linkage map of rainbow trout and
the complex architecture of the syntenies found. Even if
the comparison of the zebrafish and rainbow trout
genome is still very preliminary and based on a crude
assessment of sequence homologies, these findings suggest that chromosome rearrangements have been frequent
between zebrafish and rainbow trout at least over long
map distances, but that cases of conserved syntenies can
be found.
Duplicated regions
Extensive gene duplication has been reported early in salmonids and has been a crucial argument in favour of the
hypothesis of tetraploidy in salmonids. Our data confirm
several homeology between linkage groups already
reported or hypothesized, namely RT2–RT9, RT2–RT29,
RT3–RT25, RT7–RT15, RT10–RT18, RT12–RT16, RT14–
RT20 and RT27–RT31 ([8-10]). With respect to these previous studies, two new homeologous regions were identified here: RT6–30 and RT9–24. Finally, a new homeology
was suggested for RT17 and 22 which shared
Omy1401INRA in this study and OmyRGT6TUF in [8].
Our finding that gene orders are conserved between
homeologous markers is congruent with segregation data

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/302

which indicate the occurrence of pseudolinkage between
duplicated pairs belonging to homeologous regions. Such
pseudolinkages result from pairing between homeologous regions and alternate segregation [21] and it is likely
that rearrangement in gene orders would prevent or
impede such homeologous pairing. Our results were also
compatible with the assumption that each confirmed
homeologous region (i.e. defined by two or more shared
duplicated loci) mapped to a single chromosome arms,
with the exception of the RT3/RT25. These two linkage
groups showed a meta and acrocentric structure respectively and the three shared duplicated loci were not found
on the same arm of RT3. This could eventually reflect a
pericentric inversion involving one marker on RT3, but
this exception remains to be validated. When two homologies per arm were found, one of these homologies
involved one single pair of duplicated loci. Thus, the
occurrence of more than one homology per arm remains
hypothetical for the moment. Although the occurrence of
more than one strongly conserved homeologous region
per arm cannot be excluded, it is likely to lead to rather
complex configurations of chromosome pairing and to
unbalanced segregations at meiosis.
No unique pattern of localisation of the homeologous
segment on chromosome emerged from this study. The
homeologous regions sharing the largest number of
duplicated loci, namely RT2A/29, RT2B/9, RT12/16,
RT14/RT20 and RT27/31 did not include the centromeric
region. This is in agreement with the models of tetravalent
formation, chromatide exchange and conservation of
homology between homeologous distal region of chromosomes proposed by [21] and [5]. In the other cases,
homeology could concern whole arms or be restricted to
the region proximal to the centromere as for RT9/14.
More detailed description of the structure of homeologous linkage groups, with the addition of numerous additional loci, and sequencing of large BAC fragments
mapping to these linkage groups, both in duplicated and
apparently not duplicated regions, could be a useful step
towards the understanding of the evolution of a tetraploidized genome.

Conclusion
The present work provides a linkage map which is likely
to cover most of the genome and to identify all the chromosome arms. It should be very helpful to distinguish
between unlinked fragments due to insufficient marker
density, Robertsonian polymorphism and pseudolinkage
in future studies. In turn, this work should benefit from
the other maps under construction, specifically from the
information derived from male meiosis. In contrast with
female specific maps which show rather uniform distribution of recombination events along arms ([8]; this study),
male specific maps exhibit more recombination towards

the telomeric ends and could be more resolutive for these
regions. Finally, approximately four hundred microsatellite markers developed from EST have been mapped in
this study, which is only a very small fraction of this type
of markers available in public databases. This provides a
means to generate high-density gene maps in rainbow
trout and makes feasible comparative mapping with phylogenetically distant model species such as zebrafish (this
study; [9]) or tetraodon [7]. Our preliminary data suggest
that conservation of syntenies between rainbow trout and
model species could occasionally facilitate fine-mapping
of QTLs and, eventually, identification of candidate genes.

Methods
Mapping resource populations
The linkage map was constructed using two unrelated
doubled haploid (DH) lines (60 individuals per line). The
source population was an experimental INRA rainbow
trout strain. A grand-parental population of all
homozygous doubled haploids was first established,
using the mitotic gynogenesis [26]. Briefly, ova from individual females were fertilized with UV irradiated sperm,
and diploidy was restored by blocking first embryonic
cleavage with a heat shock. Some of the DH progenies
were sex-reversed by early hormonal treatment in order to
obtain functional males. The next generation, DH males
and DH females from different families were single-pair
mated, producing all female F1 hybrid progeny between
homozygous lines. Two of those females were reproduced
using a second round of mitotic gynogenesis in order to
produce the two mapping DH families used in this work
(INRA1 and INRA2).

and penta-nucleotide repeats. Primers were designed with
PRIMER3 software [29]. Eight hundred and fourteen
already published microsatellite markers were also
selected in databases or in publications. To discard redundant markers prior to PCR tests, sequence homologies
were first checked by Blast at low stringency (Blastall command in GCG package; chosen E-value: 10-3), then manually validated. New microsatellite markers were named in
accordance with the convention outlined by [30]. For all
microsatellite markers, species abbreviations and microsatellite source acronyms are given in [9]. PCR tests were
done on a sample consisting of the two mothers and the
four grand-parents of DH progeny. Duplicated loci were
named according to the nomenclature described in [31].
Genomic DNA samples were prepared from ethanol preserved fin tissues following simplified phenol extraction
and ethanol precipitation procedures [32]. The PCR
amplifications, separation and visualization of the PCR
products were carried out according to [31], at the annealing temperature of 58°C. When PCR amplification was
unsuccessful, the annealing temperature of 52°C was
tested. The Mg++ concentration was fixed to 2 mM.

All the individuals (4 DH grand-parents, 3 mothers and
progeny) were fin clipped and fin clips were stored in 95%
ethanol for subsequent analyses.

Two sequences, BX087958 and BX087759, were mapped
by SNP-based genotyping using sequencing and PCRRFLP procedures. Fragments of 550 and 650 base pairs
respectively were amplified by PCR. Amplifications (30
cycles, 58°C annealing, 1 mn elongation) were carried out
in 20 µl reactions containing 40 ng of genomic DNA template, 1X reaction buffer (Promega), 0.4 µM of each
primer, 250 µM of each dNTP, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.6 units Taq
polymerase (Promega). SNP polymorphism in females
was detected by sequencing. PCR products were purified
by treatment with 2 units of exonuclease 1 and one unit
of shrimp alkaline phosphatase. SNP polymorphism in
the mothers of DH progeny was detected by sequencing
using the ABI Big Dye terminator chemistry on an ABI 310
sequencer. Progeny were genotyped by PCR-RFLP methods: BX087958 and BX087579 PCR products were cut
with BsrB I and Taq I respectively following Biolabs protocol and fragments were separated in 2% agarose.

Microsatellite and SNP genotyping
A total number of 1321 primer pairs were tested. Name,
references, primer sequences of markers not submitted to
GenBank are given (see Additional file 3). Five hundred
and seven new primer pairs have been developed from
EST sequences containing microsatellite motives. A SIGENAE ENSEMBL Rainbow Trout EST Contig version 3.0
was extracted from the SIGENAE-EST database [28]. This
file was screened for short tandem repeats (two to five
nucleotides) with a software developed by F. Mougel
(unpublished). The lower repeat numbers were fixed to
eight for di and tri-nucleotide motives and to five for tetra

Linkage analysis and centromere mapping
Genotypes were converted into a backcross format with
linkage phase deduced from the genotypes of the grandparents, each offspring being equivalent to one gamete.
Since linkage phase was known, the two data files
obtained for each female were merged and analysed as a
single data set. Linkage groups, gene orders and map distances were obtained with CARTHAGENE [33]. Linkage
groups were generated with Group command for a LOD
threshold of 3. For each linkage group, a 1000:1 framework map (likelihood of the map at least 1000-fold
higher than the next highest likelihood using the same

Centromeres were mapped using a diploid meiogenetic
family (60 individuals). To produce this meiogenetic family, eggs from a single female were fertilized with UV irradiated sperm and diploidy was restored by retention of
the second polar body [27].

markers in alternate orders) was also built by using a stepwise locus adding strategy (BuilFW command). When
possible, microsatellites from ESTs were preferred to
anonymous microsatellites. The provisional frameworks
were checked for alternative orders with higher likelihood
using Flips, Greedy and Annealing commands which test
inversions and permutations of group of markers. Finally,
a comprehensive map including all the markers was built,
by adding all the remaining markers at the most likely
location with Mapcomp command and optimized with
Flip command (or details on commands, see Carthagene
user guide at [34].
Though it was not expected in female meiosis, the occurrence of pseudo-linkage was checked using a genotype file
with inverted linkage phase.
The linkage group numbers followed the current nomenclature [8,9]. Correspondences between maps were based
on the occurrence of several markers common to these
different maps. The map published by Nichols et al. [9]
also consisted of ten additional small group which were
not taken into account. In addition, linkage group OAXXVIII was no longer considered in Nichols et al. [9].
Graphic representations of linkage groups were generated
with MAPCHART version 2.1 [35]. The percentage of
recombinants was used as the mapping function to
account for the high levels of chiasma interference which
are usually reported for rainbow trout [10,24,25]
Centromeres were mapped through genotyping of meiogenetic progeny for several loci per linkage group. For
each linkage group, loci were ordered manually in such a
way that the number of recombination events was minimum. This condition is expected under the hypothesis of
complete interference. The most likely interval in which
the centromere lies was deduced from the gene-centromere distances (estimated as half the proportion of heterozygotes in the meiogynogen progeny), avoiding, as far as
possible, double recombinants per arm (hypothesis of
nearly complete interference). Details of this half-tetrad
analysis can be found in [36].
Comparative mapping with zebrafish, Danio rerio
The EST sequences of rainbow trout were masked from
known repeats and vector sequences and compared to all
the transcript sequences of the zebrafish using the Iccare
Web server [37] with the Blastn option of the BLAST program. Only the Highest Scoring Pairs (HSP) with an
expected value less than 10-5 were kept. The output file
displayed the BLAST results and the location of the rainbow trout genes on the chromosomes of the zebrafish for
each query sequence showing significant homology.
