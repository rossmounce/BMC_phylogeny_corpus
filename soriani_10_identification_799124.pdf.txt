Abstract
Background: Calcineurin, a serine/threonine-specific protein phosphatase, plays an important role in the control of
cell morphology and virulence in fungi. Calcineurin regulates localization and activity of a transcription factor called
CRZ1. Recently, we characterize Aspergillus fumigatus CRZ1 homologue, AfCrzA. Here, we investigate which
pathways are influenced by A. fumigatus AfCrzA during a short pulse of calcium by comparatively determining the
transcriptional profile of A. fumigatus wild type and ΔAfcrzA mutant strains.
Results: We were able to observe 3,622 genes modulated in at least one timepoint in the mutant when compared
to the wild type strain (3,211 and 411 at 10 and 30 minutes, respectively). Decreased mRNA abundance in the
ΔcrzA was seen for genes encoding calcium transporters, transcription factors and genes that could be directly or
indirectly involved in calcium metabolism. Increased mRNA accumulation was observed for some genes encoding
proteins involved in stress response. AfCrzA overexpression in A. fumigatus increases the expression of several of
these genes. The deleted strain of one of these genes, AfRcnA, belonging to a class of endogenous calcineurin
regulators, calcipressins, had more calcineurin activity after exposure to calcium and was less sensitive to
menadione 30 μM, hydrogen peroxide 2.5 mM, EGTA 25 mM, and MnCl2 25 mM. We constructed deletion,
overexpression, and GFP fusion protein for the closely related A. nidulans AnRcnA. GFP::RcnA was mostly detected
along the germling, did not accumulate in the nuclei and its location is not affected by the cellular response to
calcium chloride.
Conclusion: We have performed a transcriptional profiling analysis of the A. fumigatus ΔAfcrzA mutant strain
exposed to calcium stress. This provided an excellent opportunity to identify genes and pathways that are under
the influence of AfCrzA. AfRcnA, one of these selected genes, encodes a modulator of calcineurin activity.
Concomitantly with A. fumigatus AfrcnA molecular analysis, we decided to exploit the conserved features of A.
nidulans calcineurin system and investigated the A. nidulans AnRcnA homologue. A. nidulans AnRcnA mutation is
suppressing CnaA mutation and it is responsible for modulating the calcineurin activity and mRNA accumulation of
genes encoding calcium transporters.

Background
The phosphatase calcineurin is a heterodimeric protein
composed by a catalytic subunit A and a regulatory subunit B [1]. In fungi, calcineurin plays an important role
in the control of cell morphology and virulence [1-4].
Calcineurin regulates morphogenesis, Ca+2 homeostasis,
and stress-activated transcription in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [1,5]. In pathogenic fungi, calcineurin affects

virulence, morphogenesis, and antifungal drug action
[1,6-9]. Inactivation of calcineurin in Cryptococcus neoformans affects growth at 37°C and hyphal elongation
during mating and haploid fruiting [10-13]. Reduced
virulence and absence of growth in serum are also
observed in Candida albicans depleted in the calcineurin activity [11,14,15]. In A. fumigatus, calcineurin
inactivation decreases the virulence and provides
decreased filamentation and no growth in serum [9,16].
Calcineurin regulates the localization and activity of
the transcription factor Crz1p by dephosphorylating it
[17]. Upon increase in cytosolic calcium, calcineurin

dephosphorylates Crz1p, allowing its nuclear translocation [17,18]. Crz1p has a C2H2 zinc finger motif that
binds to a CDRE (calcineurin-dependent response element) in the promoters of genes that are regulated by
calcineurin and calcium [19]. Mutants of S. cerevisiae
inactivated in CRZ1 display hypersensitivity to chloride
and chitosan, a defective transcriptional response to
alkaline stress, and cellular morphology and mating
defects [17,19-21]. Inactivation CRZ1 mutants of Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Δprz1) are hypersensitive to calcium and have decreased transcription of the Pmc1 Ca
+2
pump [22]. C. albicans homozygotes crz1Δ/Δ are
moderately attenuated for virulence and sensitive to calcium, lithium, manganese, and sodium dodecyl sulfate
[18,23,24]. A. fumigatus CRZ1 mutant, ΔcrzA, is avirulent and has decreased conidiation [16,25]. Its hypersensitivity to calcium and manganese is probably due to the
reduced expression of calcium transporter mRNAs
under high concentrations of calcium [16].
Here, we investigate which pathways are influenced by
A. fumigatus AfCrzA during a short pulse of calcium by
comparatively determining the transcriptional profile of
A. fumigatus wild type and ΔAfcrzA mutant strains. Our
results revealed several possible novel targets for
AfCrzA, including AfRcnA, a member of the conserved
calcineurin-binding proteins, the calcipressins. Besides
the transcriptional profiling of the A. fumigatus ΔAfcrzA,
we also showed the molecular characterization of Aspergilli RcnAs.

Results and Discussion
Transcriptional profiling of the A. fumigatus ΔcrzA mutant
strain

To have a better understanding of which genes are
influenced by A. fumigatus AfCrzA during exposure to
calcium, we performed competitive microarray hybridizations using RNA obtained from the wild type and
ΔAfcrzA strains after short pulses (10 and 30 minutes)
of 200 mM calcium chloride. RNA obtained from wild
type mycelia exposed to 10 and 30 minutes calcium was
taken as reference. Thus, total RNA extracted from
these cultures was used to synthesize fluorescent-labeled
cDNAs for competitive microarray hybridizations. In
these experiments, the main aim was to focus on genes
that have increased or decreased mRNA expression in
the absence of AfCrzA. We were able to observe 3,622
genes modulated in at least one timepoint in the mutant
when compared to the wild type strain (3,211 and 411
at 10 and 30 minutes, respectively). The large difference
between the number of genes modulated at 10 and 30
minutes (about eight-times more at 10 minutes) suggests A. fumigatus responds rapidly to calcium stressing
conditions. The full dataset was deposited in the Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO) from the National Center

Page 2 of 18

of Biotechnology Information (NCBI) with the number
GSE15432 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/
query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE15432. Previously, to evaluate the
effect of calcium on global A. fumigatus gene expression, we performed competitive microarray hybridizations using RNA obtained from the wild type strain
before and after a short pulse (10 minutes) of 200 mM
calcium chloride (Soriani et al., 2008). Statistical analysis
of this dataset identified a total of 863 genes that displayed modulation. The large difference in genes whose
expression is modulated between this dataset and the
current dataset using a comparison between ΔcrzA and
the wild type strains emphasizes the pleiotropic role
played by A. fumigatus calcineurin-CrzA in the calciummediated signal transduction pathways. We are currently
investigating the importance of this difference.
We observed differential regulation of genes involved
in a variety of cellular processes and specific modulation
of these functions is therefore likely to be implicated
with A. fumigatus adaptation to high concentrations of
calcium (Additional files 1 and 2, Tables S1 and S2,
respectively, show the genes with log ratios more than
or equal to 1 or less than or equal to 1 in at least in
one time point, respectively). These genes were classified
into COG functional categories http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/COG/. However, we were not able to observe any
significant enrichment for a specific COG category
(Additional files 1 and 2, Tables S1 and S2, repectively).
We noted decreased mRNA abundance in the ΔAfcrzA
of several genes involved in calcium transport, such as
the vacuolar H+/Ca+2 (Afu2g07630), calcium-translocating P-type ATPase (PMCA-type, Afu3g10690), and calcium-transporting ATPase 1 (PMC1, Afu7g01030). We
also observed decreased mRNA accumulation when the
ΔAfcrzA strain was exposed to calcium of genes encoding several transcription factors [CtfA (Afu4g03960),
RfeF (Afu4g10200), and ZfpA (Afu8g05010)], and genes
that could be directly or indirectly involved in calcium
metabolism [such as a phospholipase D (Afu2g16520),
two peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases (Afu5g13350
and Afu2g03720), a calcineurin binding protein
(Afu2g13060), a Bar adaptor protein (Afu3g14230), and
a potential regulator of cytoskeleton and endocytosis,
homologue of mammalian amphiphysin. Interestingly, a
chitin synthase A (Afu2g01870) also showed decreased
mRNA accumulation in the ΔAfcrzA strain background.
Cramer et al. [26] have shown that the calcineurin pathway plays an important role in cell wall biosynthesis in
A. fumigatus, and that calcineurin and AfCrzA inactivation mutants are more sensitive to specific cell wall inhibitors, such as caspofungin. However, in contrast to our
results these authors have observed an increased and
decreased mRNA accumulation of chitin synthase A in
the ΔAfcrzA and ΔAfcalA mutant strains, respectively.

Several of the genes above mentioned (such as
Afu2g16520, Afu2g13060, Afu3g14230, Afu4g10200,
Afu8g05010, and Afu3g10690) have also been observed
by Soriani et al. [16] as more expressed upon exposure
of A. fumigatus to calcium. We have also previously
observed that zfpA (Afu8g01050) has increased mRNA
accumulation that is dependent on the cyclic AMP-protein kinase A signaling pathway during adaptation to
voriconazole [26]. Thus, it is plausible that zfpA is
related to a transcriptional network controlled by calcineurin-CrzA that has a key role in mediating cellular
stress responses.
We observed increased mRNA accumulation when the
ΔAfcrzA strain was exposed to calcium of genes encoding a class V chitinase (Afu7g08490), an exo-b-1,3-glucanase (Afu2g00430), an AAA family ATPase
(Afu4g04800), a cation diffusion facilitator 3, a multidrug resistance protein (Afu4g01140), a TOR signalling
pathway protein TipA (Afu2g07540), an inositol polyphosphate phosphatase (Afu5g02140), a representative
of the Hsp9-12 heat shock protein Scf1 (Afu1g17370),
and a protein phosphatase 2C (Afu4g00720). Again, the
increased expression of the chitinase and exo-b-1,3-glucanase could help to explain the increased sensitivity of
A. fumigatus ΔAfcrzA strain to caspofungin [26]. Interestingly, some of these genes are involved in stress
response, such as: (i) the Scf1 homologue (Afu117370),
a plasma membrane localized protein that protects
membranes from desiccation and it is induced by heat
shock, oxidative stress, osmostress, stationary phase
entry, glucose depletion, oleate and alcohol, and is regulated by the HOG and Ras-Pka pathways http://www.
yeastgenome.org[27]; (ii) TipA (Afu2g07540), a component of the TOR (target of rapamycin) signaling pathway, that interacts physically and genetically with
Tap42p, which regulates protein phosphatase 2A [28];
and (iii) a protein phosphatase 2C (Afu4g00720), important physiological regulator of cell growth and of cellular
stress signaling [29]. The increased mRNA accumulation
of these genes could mean that they are directly or
indirectly repressed by AfCrzA and can open new frontiers for studying biochemical pathways that are under
influence of the A. fumigatus calcineurin-CrzA pathway.
We then used RT-PCR, both to assess the reliability of
the microarray hybridizations and to document mRNA
expression from selected genes of interest in the wild
type, ΔAfcalA and ΔAfcrzA mutant backgrounds, choosing five genes (three and two with decreased and
increased mRNA accumulation in the microarray experiments, respectively) to analyze after 10 and 30 minutes
in the presence of 200 mM CaCl2. We had previously
shown that five other genes (such as Afu8g05010, C2H2
finger domain protein; Afu4g03960, C6 transcription
factor; Afu2g16520, phospholipase D; and Afu2g05330,

vacuolar H + /Ca +2 exchanger; and Afu2g13060, calcineurin binding protein), identified here in this screening
had induced mRNA accumulation in the presence of
calcium, but reduced in ΔAfcrzA mutant background
[16]. Expressing the results as fold induction relative to
expression prior to calcium exposure, all values were in
strong agreement with array hybridisation data (Figure
1). Comparisons between the gene expression variation
estimated by microarray and real-time RT-PCR were
performed by calculating both Pearson’s (RP) and Spearman’s (R S ) correlation coefficients for the log2 ratios
obtained by these two approaches. Positive correlation
was observed for both RP and RS in all nine genes (Figure 1) [16]. Furthermore, the value of either RP or RS
was above 0.70 (indicating moderate-to-strong correlation). Thus, these data suggest that our approach was
able to provide information about A. fumigatus gene
expression modulation with a considerably high level of
confidence.
It is very impressive the mRNA accumulation levels of
the Hsp9-12 heat shock protein Scf1 homologue
(Afu1g17370): about 100 and 1000 times more in the
ΔcrzA and ΔcalA than in the wild type, respectively (Figure 1E). A. fumigatus has two Hsp12 homologues,
Afu1g17370 (e-value = 3.7e-10; 45 and 57 identity and
similarity, respectively) and Afu6g12450 (e-value = 3.1e9; 39 and 56 identity and similarity, respectively). Interestingly, the S. cerevisiae HSP12 was also shown to be
induced by calcium but in contrast to the A. fumigatus
homologue, the S. cerevisiae gene is repressed when calcium+FK506 were added and accordingly repressed in
the ΔCRZ1 background [30]. Thus, it remains to be
determined the roles played by calcineurin, AfCrzA, and
AfHsp12p during adaptation of A. fumigatus to calcium
stress.
Recently, Hagiwara et al. [31] identified and characterized the A. nidulans AncrzA gene. They performed an
in silico analysis by using MEME (Motif-based sequence
analysis tools; http://meme.sdsc.edu/meme4_1_1/intro.
html) of the possible presence of a CDRE-like consensus
motif in the promoter regions of 25 AnCrzA-dependent
genes. By analyzing their promoter regions, 5’-G[T/G]
GGC[T/A]G[T/G]G-3’ was presumed to be the consensus sequence for the A. nidulans AnCrzA-dependent
genes. By using a combination of MEME analysis and
the A. nidulans CDRE consensus as a guide, we were
able to identify in the AfrcnA, AfrfeF, AfBAR, and the A.
fumigatus phospholipase D promoter regions (about 500
bp upstream ATG) the following CDRE motifs: (i)
AfrcnA (5’-GTTGGTGAG-3’, -314 bp upstream ATG
starting point), (ii) AfrfeF (5’GTGGCTGAT-3’, -184 bp
upstream ATG), (iii) AfBAR (5’-GTGGCTGAC-3’, -309
bp upstream ATG), and (iv) A. fumigatus phospholipase
D (5’-GTTGGAGAG-3’, -239 upstream ATG). We

(Afu3g14230), (D) Af AAA ATPase (Afu4g04800), and (E) AfScf1 (Afu1g17370). Real-time RT-PCR was the method used to quantify the mRNA. The
measured quantity of the mRNA in each of the treated samples was normalized using the CT values obtained for the b-tubulin (Afu1g10910)
mRNA amplifications run in the same plate. The relative quantitation of all the genes and tubulin gene expression was determined by a
standard curve (i.e., CT -values plotted against logarithm of the DNA copy number). The results are the means ± standard deviation of four sets
of experiments. The values represent the number of times the genes are expressed compared to the corresponding control strain grown before
adding 200 mM CaCl2 (represented absolutely as 1.00).

compared these motifs with the promoter regions (about
500 bp upstream ATG) of 32 repressed genes described
in Additional file 1, Table S1, and this analysis suggested
5’-GT[T/G]G[G/C][T/A]GA[G/T]-3’ as the CDRE-consensus sequence for A. fumigatus AfCrzA-dependent
genes. We also analyzed Afscf1 and Af AAA ATPase
genes and found the following CDRE-like motifs: (i)
Afscf1 (5’-GGGAACGAA-3’, -376 bp upstream ATG),
and (ii) Af AAA ATPase (5’-GAAGACGAG-3’, -19 bp
upstream ATG). Again, we compared these motifs with
the promoter regions (about 500 bp upstream ATG) of
109 induced genes described in Additional file 2, Table
S2, and we were able to propose as a putative CDRE
consensus for gene repressed by AfCrzA, the sequence
5’-G[A/G][A/G][A/G]ACGA[A/G]-3’. It remains to be
experimentally determined if these sequences are really
important for AfCrzA gene regulation, both for gene
induction and repression.
Prior to this work, a study analysing global gene
expression regulated by the calcineurin/Crz1p signaling
pathway in S. cerevisiae had attempted to identify genes
regulated by calcium and sodium [30]. Calcineurin activation induced 153 genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis, ion homeostasis, vesicle trafficking, lipid synthesis,
and protein degradation. A notable similarity was
observed by the authors in the gene expression patterns
of FK506-treated cells and crz1 cells, suggesting that
Crz1p is required for most calcineurin-dependent
changes in gene expression. Recently, Soriani et al. [16]
opted to an alternative strategy, exposing A. fumigatus
wild type strain to a short pulse with a high concentration of calcium, and arbitrarily choosing several genes
that were less or more expressed in the microarray
hybridization analyses to verify their expression in the
wild type, and ΔAfcalA and ΔAfcrzA mutant strains by
real-time RT-PCR. Thus, these authors were able to
determine if the expression of these genes was dependent on calcineurin and/or AfCrzA. They verified that
the majority of these genes suffered blocking of mRNA
accumulation in the ΔAfcrzA background. The results
shown here added more information about the transcriptional network involved in the calcineurin-AfCrzA
in response to calcium.
Construction of Aspergilli CrzA overexpression strains

Overexpression of AfCrzA could reveal genes regulated
by the calcineurin-AfCrzA pathway. Accordingly, we
constructed an overexpression A. fumigatus AfCrzA
strain by using the alcA promoter. The A. nidulans alcA
promoter homologously replaced the AfcrzA promoter
(for details of the construction, see Methods section).
The alcA promoter is repressed by glucose, derepressed
by glycerol and induced to high levels by ethanol or Lthreonine [32]. When A. fumigatus is grown on glycerol
2% supplemented either with ethanol 2% or threonine

Page 5 of 18

100 mM, AfcrzA mRNA accumulation in increased
about 3.8- and 3.6-times, respectively compared to
growth on glucose 4% (Figure 2A, left and right graphs).
As expected, when the AfcrzA is repressed in the presence of glucose, the alcA::AfcrzA strain is more sensitive to calcium (Figure 2B); however, surprisingly high
levels of AfCrzA mRNA accumulation also make the
alcA::AfcrzA strain more calcium-sensitive (Figure 2B).
These results suggest that CrzA overexpression could
potentially disturb the mRNA accumulation of genes
that are important for the calcium homeostasis in the
cell, thus disturbing the calcium metabolism into the
cell and consequently the growth in the presence of
increasing calcium concentrations. To test this hypothesis we used real-time RT-PCR to verify the mRNA
levels of selected genes observed as having decreased
mRNA and increased accumulation (see Additional file
1, Table S1). As it can be seen in Figure 3, all tested
genes to different extent have increased mRNA accumulation when the AfcrzA is overexpressed. The Af AAA
ATPase (Afu4g04800) and AfScf1 (Afu1g17370) have
increased mRNA accumulation when the ΔAfcrzA was
exposed to calcium suggesting they are repressed by
AfCrzA (see Figures 1E-F). We expected their mRNA
accumulation would be reduced when AfCrzA is overexpressed. However, the mRNA levels of these genes were
lower in the alcA::AfcrzA than in the ΔAfcrzA mutant
strain (compare Figures 1E-F with Figures 3I-J), what
could indicate that AfCrzA is partially controlling the
mRNA accumulation levels of these genes. The genes
encoding AfpmcB (Afu3g10690), AfrcnA (Afu2g13060),
AfrfeF (Afu4g10200), and AfBAR adaptor protein
(Afu3g14230) are about 14, 16, 13, and 250 times more
expressed in the alcA::AfcrzA mutant than the wild type
strain, respectively (Figure 3B and 3F-H). The AfpmcB
(Afu3g10690) gene is A. fumigatus homologue of the
yeast PMC1, a vacuolar Ca+2 ATPase involved in depleting cytosol of Ca+2 ions and preventing growth inhibition by activation of calcineurin in the presence of
elevated concentrations of calcium [33]. The increased
expression of this gene suggests AfCrzA is controlling
directly or indirectly its expression. Furthermore, the
increased mRNA accumulation of these calcium transporter-encoding genes is quite consistent taking into
consideration the dramatic stress condition caused by
the sudden increase in calcium concentration that needs
either to be removed from the cytoplasm or transported
to vacuoles. Considering the growth inhibition of the
Aspergilli alcA::AfcrzA strain under high-Ca+2 conditions
(see Figures 2A-B), one possible interpretation of these
results is that the AfCrzA overexpression can inhibit the
function of another factor that is necessary for growth
under high-Ca+2 conditions.

the means ± standard deviation of four sets of experiments. The values represent the number of times the genes are expressed compared to

A. fumigatus AfRcnA belongs to a class of endogenous
calcineurin regulators, calcipressins, a family of calcineurin-binding proteins, conserved from yeast to mammals [34,35]. A phylogenetic analysis was performed to
determine the relationship of AfRcnA to calcipressin
homologues in several different organisms (Additional
file 3, Figure S1). The mechanism how this protein
family functions still remains controversial. There are

reports showing that calcipressins can both stimulate
and inhibit the calcineurin pathway 34-36. Induction of
S. cerevisiae RCN1-lacZ in response to calcium was
completely blocked by addition of FK506 or by deletion
of the genes encoding Tcn1p or calcineurin [33]. The S.
cerevisiae RCN1 is also induced by calcium, repressed
by calcium+FK506 and in the crz1 background [30].
Another member of this family, Cbp1, was identified in

Soriani et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:12
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/12

Cryptococcus neoformans, and is required for mating but
not for growth at 37°C [37]. We have observed that
AfrcnA mRNA accumulation upon calcium stress is
dependent on both calcineurin and AfCrzA (Figure 1A).
These results suggest that both S. cerevisiae and A.
fumigatus RCAN homologues may be downstream targets of the calcineurin-dependent transcription factor.
This fits a model where increased A. fumigatus AfRcnA
regulation in response to calcineurin signaling is possibly a negative-feedback mechanism modulating calcineurin acitivity.
We constructed an A. nidulans alcA::AncrzA also by
replacing the endogenous AncrzA promoter region
homologously with the A. nidulans alcA promoter. We
investigate the genetic interactions between ΔAncnaA
and ΔAncrzA mutations and a double mutant ΔAncnaA
ΔAncrzA displays the same growth behavior than the
ΔAncnaA mutant indicating as expected that AncnaA is
epistatic to AncrzA (data not shown).
Molecular characterization of the Aspergilli calcipressin
homologue

To have more information about the function of some
of the genes identified as more expressed in the A. fumigatus wild type and repressed in the ΔAfcrzA, we inactivated the AfrcnA (Afu2g13060), AfrfeF (Afu4g10200), Af
BAR adaptor protein (Afu3g14230), and A. fumigatus
phospholipase D (Afu2g16520). Since calcium is
involved in different kinds of stresses, such as oxidative
stress and uncontrolled proliferation and survival
[38-44], we decided to determine if several different culture conditions could affect the growth of these deletion
strains. Except for ΔAfrcnA, the deletion mutants
showed comparable growth phenotypes to the wild type
strain in the presence of the following agents or stressing situations: oxidizing agents and metals (paraquat, tbutyl hydroperoxide, zinc, iron, and chromium), calcium, cyclosporine A, DNA damaging agents (4-nitroquinoline oxide, hydroxyurea, camptothecin, and
bleomycin), and temperature (30, 37, and 44°C) (data
not shown). However, ΔAfrcnA growth was less sensitive
to menadione 30 μM, hydrogen peroxide 2.5 mM,
EGTA 25 mM, and MnCl 2 25 mM (Figure 4B). We
exposed both wild type and ΔAfrcnA strains for 200
mM calcium chloride for 10 minutes and measured the
calcineurin activity in these strains (Figure 4C). In the
wild type strain, there is about 50% increase in the calcineurin activity when the mycelia was exposed to calcium
chloride 200 mM for 10 minutes (Figure 4C). However,
in the ΔAfrcnA mutant strain there is a significant
increase in the calcineurin activity at 0 and 10 minutes
in the presence of calcium chloride (Figure 4C). These
results suggest that AfRcnA has an inhibitory effect on
calcineurin activity when A. fumigatus is exposed to
high calcium concentrations.

We also investigated how the AfrcnA deletion would
affect the mRNA accumulation of the genes observed as
modulated by AfCrzA (see Figure 1). Thus, we exposed
both the wild type and AfΔrcnA mutant strains to CaCl2
200 mM for 10 and 30 minutes and measured the
mRNA accumulation of these genes (Figure 5). The
absence of AfRcnA has a very heterogeneous influence
on the mRNA accumulation of these genes. The AfrfeF
(Afu4g10200) and Af AAA ATPase (Afu4g04800) genes
have increased mRNA accumulation in the absence of
AfrcnA when compared to the wild type strain (about
1.5- and 5.0-times and about the same and 5-times
increased at 10 and 30 minutes, respectively; Figures 5A
and 5D). In contrast, the A. fumigatus phospholipase D
(Afu2g16520) gene has lower mRNA accumulation of
3.6- and 5.0-times in the AfΔrcnA mutant than the wild
type strain (Figure 5C). The mRNA accumulation of the
Af BAR (Afu3g14230) and AfScf1 (Afu1g17370) genes is
not affected by the absence of AfrcnA (Figures 5B and
5E). These data emphasize the complex influence of
AfRcnA on the calcineurin pathway, both stimulating
and inhibiting genes in this pathway.
After several attempts, we were unable to obtain a
completely functional A. fumigatus GFP::AfRcnA and an
overexpression alcA:AfrcnA strains (data not shown).
Thus, we decided to exploit the conserved features of A.
nidulans calcineurin system [see [30]] and construct
both an A. nidulans GFP and an alcA::AnrcnA strain.
The A. nidulans AnRcnA homologue (AN6249.3) has
about 71% identity and 82% (e-value 3e-94) similarity
with the A. fumigatus AnRcnA (see also Additional file
3, Figure S1). Furthermore, to have a more detailed analysis of the A. nidulans AnRcnA, we also constructed an
A. nidulans ΔAnrcnA deletion strain (Figure 6A). We
evaluated its phenotype by using the same strategies
above outlined for the A. fumigatus ΔAfrcnA. The A.
nidulans ΔAnrcnA radial diameter is about 25% smaller
than the wild type strain (Figure 6B). It is also more
resistant to cyclosporine A (observe both strains have
the same radial diameter when grown in the presence of
cyclosporine A, however A. nidulans ΔAnrcnA is smaller
than the wild type; Figure 6B). We have observed that
the deletion of A. nidulans AnrcnA also confers more
resistance to an oxidative stressing agent, paraquat at 4
mM (Figure 6B). Interestingly, A. nidulans showed
about 3.5 times more mRNA accumulation of the rcnA
gene when mycelia were exposed to 0.5 mM menadione
compared to mycelia not exposed to it (data not shown).
The first member identified from the calcipressin
family, RCAN1, was isolated from the hamster genome
as a gene induced during transient adaptation to oxidative stress [42,43]. It was observed that resistance to oxidative stress and calcium stress increased as a function
of RCAN1 expression and decreased as its expression

however, germlings not exposed to calcium chloride displayed essentially the same results. Images were captured by direct acquisition. Bars, 5

diminished [44]. Porta et al. [35] have shown that
RCAN1 mRNA and protein expression are sensitive to
oxidative stress in primary neurons, and that Rcan1-/neurons display an increased resistance to damage by
hydrogen peroxide. Taken together, our results suggest
that Aspergilli RcnA play a role in calcium and oxidative
stress signaling.
Next step, we crossed the A. nidulans ΔAnrcnA strain
with ΔAncnaA strain (cnaA encodes the catalytic subunit of the calcineurin gene) [30]. The A. nidulans
ΔAnrcnA mutation can partially suppress the ΔAncnaA
growth defect, suggesting a genetic interaction between
AnRcnA and AnCnaA (Figure 6C). To determine the
AnRcnA cellular localization, we transformed a GFP::
AnRcnA cassette into a wild type strain. Several transformants were obtained in which the plasmid had integrated homologously at the AnrcnA locus (data not
shown). Thus, in these strains GFP::AnRcnA is the only
source of protein and GFP::AnRcnA strains are completely functional, i.e., they displayed cyclosporine A/paraquat-sensitivity comparable to the wild type strain (data
not shown). Figure 6D shows GFP::AnRcnA germlings
that were grown for 24 hs in MM+2% glycerol at 30°C
and either incubated or not in the presence of calcium
chloride 50 mM or EGTA 25 mM for 5 to 15 minutes.
In all conditions, AnRcnA was mostly detected along
the germling and did not accumulate in the nuclei (Figure 6D and data not shown). The same results were
observed when glucose was used as a single carbon
source (data not shown). These results show that
AnRcnA cellular localization is not affected by the cellular response to calcium chloride.
We overexpressed AnrcnA aiming to investigate genes
that could be potentially regulated by the calcipressincalcineurin pathway. Accordingly, we constructed an A.
nidulans overexpression AnrcnA strain by using the
alcA promoter. We used real-time RT-PCR to test the
mRNA levels of AnrcnA when the wild type and alcA::
AnrcnA strains were grown in the presence of either
glucose or glycerol+ethanol as carbon sources (Figure
7A). The AnrcnA gene showed about the same mRNA
accumulation when the wild type strain was grown
either in the presence of glucose or glycerol+ethanol
(Figures 7A). However, when the alcA::AnrcnA strain
was grown in the presence of glycerol+ethanol, the
AnrcnA gene had a mRNA accumulation of about 16.0
times when compared its growth in the presence of glucose (Figures 7A). Surprisingly, AnRcnA overexpression
in liquid medium (for 16 hours at 37°C) did not cause
any growth inhibition in the presence of either calcium
or cyclosporine (data not shown). AnRcnA overexpression (for 16 hours at 37°C) also had no effect on the
ΔAncnaA phenotype in liquid medium (data not
shown). Next, we observed the effects of overexpressing

Page 12 of 18

AnRcnA on calcineurin activity. Interestingly, calcineurin activity is dramatically increased when the wild
type strain was grown in the presence of ethanol (Figure
7B). In the alcA::AnrcnA strain, calcineurin activity was
reduced about 50% (Figure 7B), what it is again consistent with a role for Aspergilli RcnAs in the inhibition of
calcineurin activity. Both strains display the same calcineurin activity when grown in the presence of glucose
(Figure 7B). Assuming an inhibitory role for AnRcnA on
the calcineurin activity, it should be expected an
increase in the calcineurin activity for the alcA::AnrcnA
grown in the presence of glucose. However, the lack of
reduction in the calcineurin activity is possibly due to
the fact that the rcnA mRNA accumulation was not
completely abolished in the alcA::AnrcnA grown in the
presence of glucose (Figure 7A). Overexpression of the
yeast protein Rcn1p or the human homologues also
inhibited the activation of the transcription factor Crz1p
and the inhibition of the H+/Ca2+ exchanger Vcx1p [33].
We investigated the effects of AnRcnA overexpression
on the mRNA accumulation of the calcium transporters
pmcA (AN1189.3) and pmcB (AN4920.3), two A. nidulans PMC1 homologues. Low and about similar pmcA
and pmcB mRNA accumulation were seen when the
wild type and the alcA::AnrcnA mutant strains were
grown in the presence of glucose (Figure 7C). In contrast, pmcA and pmcB levels were about 16 and 5 times
higher the alcA::AnrcnA strain than in the wild type
when both strains were grown in the presence of glycerol+ethanol (Figure 7C). These results strongly suggest
that AnRcnA can directly or indirectly influence the
pmcA and pmcB mRNA accumulation. Thus, it is possible RcnA has both stimulatory and inhibitory activity
depending on the calcineurin pathway activation by calcium stress.
Taken together, these results strongly suggest that: (i)
rcnA genes are involved in the oxidative stress and calcium stress in Aspergilli, (ii) both AncnaA and AnrcnA
genes showed genetic interactions, and (iii) RcnA can
modulate calcineurin activity and the mRNA accumulation of genes encoding calcium transporters. What is
the nature of the interaction between Aspergilli CnaA
and RcnA? These interactions could mean protein-protein interactions, and considering that calcipressin
homologues from other species were already shown to
interact with calcineurin 35,45, we investigated the possibility of AfRcnA to bind AfCnaA by using yeast twohybrid analysis. Our results have not revealed any even
weak interaction between these two proteins (data not
shown), suggesting that the basis for the interaction is
either not related to protein-protein interaction or alternatively there are other proteins or conditions that mediate this interactions that cannot be completely
recapitulated by using yeast two-hybrid assays. The

in (B) was performed and pmcA and pmcB mRNA accumulation was evaluated by real-time RT-PCR. For (A) the relative quantitation of all the
genes and tubulin gene expression was determined by a standard curve (i.e., CT -values plotted against logarithm of the DNA copy number).
The results are the means standard deviation of four sets of experiments. The values represent the number of times the genes are expressed
compared to the corresponding wild type control strain (represented absolutely as 1.00).

ΔAnrcnA mutation suppresses the ΔAncnaA mutation
and suppression of a null allele is expected to be due to
downstream mutations that activate the pathway independent of the original (suppressed) gene product [45].
This suppression is essentially visible in terms of the
recovery of the colonial growth and increase in the
radial diameter of the double mutant (see Figure 5C).
Considering the dramatic morphological phenotype of
ΔAncnaA strain, it is possible that besides controlling
calcineurin activity, AnRcnA is also involved in Aspergillus development. Involvement of calcipressins in development has been previously reported for the Drosophila
melanogaster sarah mutants [46]. Eggs laid by sarah

mutant females arrest in anaphase of meiosis I and fail
to fully polyadenylate and translate bicoid mRNA.
Furthermore, sarah mutant eggs show elevated cyclin B
levels, indicating a failure to inactivate M-phase promoting factor (MPF). Taken together, these results demonstrate that calcium signaling is involved in Drosophila
egg activation. It remains to be determined the further
involvement of AnRcnA in A. nidulans development.
During the writing of this paper, a complementary
study reporting the construction of the ΔAfrcnA mutant
in the A. fumigatus strain AF293 was published (named
CbpA) [47]. These authors observed that deletion of the
cbpA gene resulted in reduced hyphal growth and

Soriani et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:12
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/12

limited attenuated virulence. Different from our results,
they also observed that the ΔcbpA strain showed
increased calcium tolerance compared to the wild-type
strain. Some differences between ours and their results
can be credited to A. fumigatus strain differences. However, it is interesting to emphasize the fact that both
Aspergilli showed some differences in the susceptibilities
to manganese and EGTA (A. fumigatus) and cyclosporine A (A. nidulans). In contrast, those authors have
shown that the A. fumigatus AF293 ΔcbpA and wildtype strains displayed an equal sensitivity to the oxidants
menadione and hydrogen peroxide, and were also not
able to demonstrate a direct protein-protein interaction
between A. fumigatus CbpA and AfCnaA [47].

Conclusion
We have performed a transcriptional profiling analysis
of the A. fumigatus ΔAfcrzA mutant strain exposed to
calcium stress. This provided an excellent opportunity
to identify genes and pathways that are under the influence of AfCrzA. We validated the relationship between
AfCrzA and these selected genes by using deletion analysis and by checking through real-time RT-PCR the
mRNA accumulation of these genes expressed either in
the ΔAfcrzA or overexpression strains. AfRcnA, one of
these selected genes, encodes a modulator of calcineurin
activity. Recently, we demonstrated that contrary to previous findings, the gene encoding the A. nidulans calcineurin catalytic subunit homologue, AncnaA, is not
essential and that the AncnaA deletion mutant shares
the morphological phenotypes observed in the corresponding A. fumigatus mutant, ΔcalA [30]. Thus, we
decided once more to exploit the conserved features of
A. nidulans calcineurin system and concomitantly with
A. fumigatus AfrcnA molecular analysis, we investigated
the A. nidulans AnRcnA homologue. AnRcnA showed
to interact genetically with AnCnaA and be responsible
for modulating the calcineurin activity and mRNA accumulation of genes encoding calcium transporters.
In summary, our work opens exciting new avenues for
research into environmental sensing and nutrient acquisition mediated by the calcineurin-CrzA pathway in this
important human pathogen.

of two basic types. A complete medium with three variants: YAG (2% glucose, 0.5% yeast extract, 2% agar,
trace elements), YUU (YAG supplemented with 1.2 g/l
each of uracil and uridine) and liquid YG or YG + UU
medium of the same compositions (but without agar). A
modified minimal medium (MM: 1% glucose, original
high nitrate salts, trace elements, 2% agar, pH 6.5) was
also used. Trace elements, vitamins, and nitrate salts are
described by Kafer [48]. Expression of tagged genes
under the control of alcA promoter was regulated by
carbon source: repression on glucose 4% (w/v), derepression on glycerol and induction on ethanol or threonine. Therefore, MM-G and MM-E (or MM-T) were
identical to MM, except that glycerol (2% v/v) and/or
ethanol (2% v/v for liquid medium) or threonine (100
mM for solid medium) were used, respectively, in place
of glucose as the sole carbon source. Strains were grown
at 37°C unless indicated otherwise. Cyclosporine A
(CsA) used in the experiments throughout the manuscript is from Neoral™ Sandimmun (Novartis). Standard
genetic techniques for A. nidulans were used for all
strain constructions [49].
RNA isolation

For the microarray experiments, 1.0 × 109 conidia of A.
fumigatus wild type and ΔcrzA strains were used to
inoculate 400 ml liquid cultures (YG) in 1000 ml erlenmeyer flasks that were incubated in a reciprocal shaker
(250 rpm) at 37°C for 16 hours. After this period, the
germlings were harvested by filtration and transferred to
a fresh YG medium plus 200 mM of CaCl2 for either 10
or 30 minutes. Again, after this period, the germlings
were harvested by centrifugation or filtration immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. For total RNA isolation,
the germlings were disrupted by grinding in liquid nitrogen with pestle and mortar and total RNA was extracted
with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, USA). Ten micrograms
of RNA from each treatment were then fractionated in
2.2 M formaldehyde, 1.2% w/v agarose gel, stained with
ethidium bromide, and then visualized with UV-light.
The presence of intact 25S and 17S ribosomal RNA
bands was used as a criterion to assess the integrity of
the RNA. RNAse free DNAse I treatment for the realtime RT-PCR experiments was carried out as previously
described [50].

Methods

Assay for calcineurin activity

Strains and media methods

Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared by homogenizing
the mycelia using liquid nitrogen in a buffer containing
50 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.4, 1 mM EGTA, 0.2% Triton X100, 1 mM benzamidine, and 10 g/ml each of leupeptin,
pepstatin and aprotinine. The homogenates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C
and then at 20,800 × g for 60 min at 4°C. Protein content in the extracts was determined by the method of
Bradford [51] and then used for calcineurin activity

A. fumigatus strains used in this study are CEA17
(pyrG-), CEA17-80 (wild type), ΔcalA [9], FMS5 (ΔcrzA::
pyrG) [16], ALCCRZA (alcA::crzA), and RCNA (ΔrcnA).
A. nidulans strains used are GR5 (pyroA4 pyrG89; wA3),
TNO2a3 (pyroA4 pyrG8 ΔnKUa::argB) [49], CNA1
(ΔcnaA::pyroA; pyroA4 pyrG89; wA3) [16], ALCRZA1
(pyroA4, alcA::gfp::crzA), RCNA1 (pyroA4, ΔrcnA::pyrG),
and ALCARCNA (pyroA4, alcA::gfp::rcnA). Media were

assays. Calcineurin activity in the cytoplasmic extracts
was assayed according to the method of Wang and Pallen [52], with minor modifications, by determining calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase activity in the
absence or in the presence of the inhibitor CsA (5 mM).
CsA is an immunosuppressant that targets calcineurin
by forming a molecular complex with cytosolic protein
cyclophilin of immunocompetent lymphocytes, especially
T-lymphocytes. This complex of CsA and cyclophylin
inhibits its phosphatase activity. Assays were performed
in a reaction mixture (100- l volume) containing 25 mM
Tris (pH 7.2), 25 mM MES (pH 7.0), 5 mM p-nitrophenyl phosphate, followed by incubation at 30°C for 10
min, and terminated by the addition of 10 l of 13% (w/
v) KH2PO4. The absorbance of the samples was measured immediately at 405 nM. The difference between
the amounts of p-nitrophenol released in the absence
and the presence of ciclosporin represented the phosphatase activity mediated by calcineurin. One unit of
enzyme activity is defined as nmol of p-nitrophenol
released from p-nitrophenyl phosphate.min-1 .mg protein-1.
Gene Expression Methods

We have used the A. fumigatus oligonucleotide slides
version 2 for microarray hybridizations (for details see
http://pfgrc.jcvi.org/index.php/microarray/array_description/aspergillus_fumigatus/version2.html). The RNA
samples extracted, as described above, were further purified with the RNA easy kit (Qiagen, Germany) and
directly labelled by incorporation of Cy3- or Cy5-dUTP
(GE Health Care). The resulting data was averaged from
duplicate genes on each array, from dye-swap hybridizations for each experiment, and from two biological replicates, taking a total of 8 intensity data points for each
gene. Differentially expressed genes at the 95% confidence level were determined using intensity-dependent
Z-scores (with Z = 1.96) as implemented in MIDAS and
the union of all genes identified at each time point were
considered significant in this experiment. The resulting
data were organized and visualized based on similar
expression vectors in genes using Euclidean distance
and hierarchical clustering with average linkage clustering method to view the whole data set and k-means to
group the genes in 60 clusters with TIGR MEV (multi
experiment viewer), also available at http://www.jcvi.org/
cms/research/software. All the hybridization conditions
and microarray data analysis were performed as previously described by Malavazi et al. [53]. When RT-PCR
was used to assess the reliability of the microarray
hybridizations germlings were exposed to a novel
growth curve (new RNA samples, not stocks of the original RNA used in the array experiment).

Real-time RT PCR reactions

All the PCR and RT-PCR reactions were performed
using an ABI 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied
Biosystems, USA). Taq-Man™ Universal PCR Master
Mix kit (Applied Biosystems, USA) was used for PCR
reactions. The reactions and calculations were performed according to Semighini et al. [49]. The primers
and Lux™ fluorescent probes (Invitrogen, USA) used in
this work are described in Additional file 4, Table S3.
Staining and microscopy

For cell imaging of RcnA fused to GFP, conidiospores
were grown in glass-bottom dishes (Mattek Corporation,
USA) in 2 ml of MM+2% glycerol for 24 hours at 30°C.
All the confocal images were analysed using the Leica
TCS SP5 laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica
Microsystems, Heidelberg, Germany) (Laboratory of
Confocal Microscopy, FMRP-USP, Brazil) using 63×
magnification water immersion objective lens using laser
lines 488 nm for GFP and 405 nm for DAPI. Images
were captured by direct acquisition with the Leica LAS
AF software (Leica Microsystems) and additional processing was carried out using Adobe Photoshop 7.0 (Adobe
Systems Incorporated, CA).
DNA manipulations and construction of the Aspergilli
conditional mutants

DNA manipulations were according to Sambrook and
Russell [54]. All PCR reactions were performed using
Platinum Taq DNA Polimerase High Fidelity (Invitrogen). For the DNA-mediated transformation, the deletion cassettes were constructed by “in vivo”
recombination in S. cerevisiae as previously described by
Colot et al. [55]. About 2.0-kb regions on either side of
the ORFs were selected for primer design. For the construction of the A. fumigatus rcnA deletion, the primers
calp-Afu P1 and calp-Afu P2 were used to amplify the
5’-UTR flanking region of the targeted ORF. The primers calp-Afu P3 and calp-Afu P4 were used to amplify
the 3’-UTR ORF flanking region. For the construction
of the A. nidulans rcnA deletion, the primers calp-Ani
P1 and calp-Ani P2 were used to amplify the 5’-UTR
flanking region of the targeted ORF. The primers calpAni P3 and calp-Ani P4 were used to amplify the 3’UTR ORF flanking region. Both fragments 5- and 3UTR were PCR-amplified from genomic DNA using as
templates the A4 strain for A. nidulans and AFU293 for
A. fumigatus cassettes. The pyrG used in the Aspergilli
cassettes for generating both deletion strains was used
as marker for auxotrophy and were amplified (by using
primers pyrG Fw and pyrG Rw) from pCDA21 plasmid
[56].
Cassettes generation was achieved by transforming
each fragment for each construction along with the plasmid pRS426 BamHI/EcoRI cut in the in S. cerevisiae
strain SC9421 by the lithium acetate method [57]. The

Soriani et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:12
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/12

DNA of the yeast transformants was extracted by the
method described by Goldman et al. [58], dialysed and
transformed by electroporation in Escherichia coli strain
DH10B to rescue the pRS426 plasmid harboring the cassettes. The cassettes were PCR-amplified from these
plasmids and used for transformation of Aspergilli
according to the procedure of Osmani et al. [59]. Transformants were scored for their ability to grow on minimal medium. PCR or Southern blot analyses were used
throughout of the manuscript to demonstrate that the
transformation cassettes had integrated homologously at
the targeted A. fumigatus or A. nidulans loci.
The A. fumigatus alcA::AfcrzA and A. nidulans alcA::
AncrzA constructions were performed by amplifying by
PCR 5’-end fragments (for A. fumigatus, 1084-bp from
the start codon of the ORF with the primers Afcrz1
AscI:
5’-GGCGCGCCAATGGCTTCACAGGAGATGTTCC-3’ and Afcrz1 PacI: 5’-CCTTAATTAAGCACATTGGGCATCATTTCCTGTCC-3’; and for A.
nidulans, 1068 bp from the start codon of the ORF with

PacI 5’-CCTTAATTAACATCTGTGACGCTTGCCCGATATC-3’), digesting them with PacI and AscI, and
cloning them in the corresponing PacI and AscI restriction sites of the pMCB17-apx plasmid. The fragment of
the ORF is under the control of the A. nidulans alcA
promoter and after homologous integration the translation produces an N-terminal fusion protein. A. fumigatus and A. nidulans pyrG- strains were transformed with
the corresponding vectors pMCB17-apx-crzA and after
homologous recombination the alcA::gfp::crzA construction and a truncated crzA non-coding gene were generated. All the transformants were confirmed by PCR
using specific primers.

Phylogenetic analysis was carried out using the MEGA-2 (Molecular
Evolutionary Genetics Analysis version 3.1) software (18, 2001; http://
www.megasoftware.net). The SSR sequences were aligned and the
dendrogram was determined by using the ClustalX and the NeighborJoining method, respectively (Saitou and Nei, 1987; Thompson et al.,
1997). A bootstrap analysis (Felsenstein 1985) was performed (for 1,025
repeats) to evaluate the topology of the phylogenetic tree. The
followings proteins were used forthe analysis: Equus caballus
