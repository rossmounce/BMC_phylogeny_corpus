Abstract
Background: Over the past few years, the use of molecular techniques to detect cultivationindependent, eukaryotic diversity has proven to be a powerful approach. Based on small-subunit
ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene analyses, these studies have revealed the existence of an
unexpected variety of new phylotypes. Some of them represent novel diversity in known
eukaryotic groups, mainly stramenopiles and alveolates. Others do not seem to be related to any
molecularly described lineage, and have been proposed to represent novel eukaryotic kingdoms. In
order to review the evolutionary importance of this novel high-level eukaryotic diversity critically,
and to test the potential technical and analytical pitfalls and limitations of eukaryotic environmental
DNA surveys (EES), we analysed 484 environmental SSU rRNA gene sequences, including 81 new
sequences from sediments of the small river, the Seymaz (Geneva, Switzerland).
Results: Based on a detailed screening of an exhaustive alignment of eukaryotic SSU rRNA gene
sequences and the phylogenetic re-analysis of previously published environmental sequences using
Bayesian methods, our results suggest that the number of novel higher-level taxa revealed by
previously published EES was overestimated. Three main sources of errors are responsible for this
situation: (1) the presence of undetected chimeric sequences; (2) the misplacement of several fastevolving sequences; and (3) the incomplete sampling of described, but yet unsequenced eukaryotes.
Additionally, EES give a biased view of the diversity present in a given biotope because of the
difficult amplification of SSU rRNA genes in some taxonomic groups.
Conclusions: Environmental DNA surveys undoubtedly contribute to reveal many novel
eukaryotic lineages, but there is no clear evidence for a spectacular increase of the diversity at the
kingdom level. After re-analysis of previously published data, we found only five candidate lineages
of possible novel high-level eukaryotic taxa, two of which comprise several phylotypes that were
found independently in different studies. To ascertain their taxonomic status, however, the
organisms themselves have now to be identified.

Background
Over the past few years, cultivation-independent identification of microbial organisms by PCR amplification and
sequencing of small-subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA)

genes revealed a huge diversity of eubacterial and archaeal
phylotypes in environmental samples, many of which are
not represented by cultured organisms [1,2]. Recently, the
same techniques have been applied to surveys of

eukaryotic diversity in different marine and freshwater
biotopes, including planktonic [3,4] and some extreme,
anoxic [5], acidic and iron-rich [6] or deep-sea hydrothermal vent [7,8] environments. All these studies revealed an
unexpectedly high diversity of new eukaryotic phylotypes
at three distinct taxonomic levels. Some of them can be
attributed to novel species in already known genera, families or orders. Others represent novel lineages within
already known eukaryotic groups, such as fungi, stramenopiles, alveolates, and kinetoplastids [8-11]. Finally,
some of these new phylotypes do not seem to be related
to any described lineage, and have been proposed to represent novel high-level taxonomic diversity in eukaryotes
[5,7,8].
Here we report 81 new partial SSU rRNA gene sequences
of eukaryotes from sediments of the small river, the Seymaz (Geneva, Switzerland). We analyze these sequences
together with 403 complete or nearly complete environmental eukaryotic sequences available in GenBank. We
point out some of the pitfalls that can impede a correct
interpretation of the results of eukaryotic environmental
DNA surveys (EES), and evaluate the candidature of some
phylotypes to represent novel higher-level eukaryotic lineages. We discuss the impact of an accurate assessment of
the environmental diversity on our view of eukaryote
megaevolution, in light of recent hypotheses about the
shape of the eukaryotic tree and the position of its root.

Results
Sequencing of 81 clones from an EES of the small river,
the Seymaz (Geneva, Switzerland) yielded 58 distinct SSU
rRNA phylotypes. The size of the sequences varies from
760 to 900 base pairs, which corresponds to the average
size expected for the amplified fragment (helices 27 to 50
of the SSU rRNA secondary structure). Size variations
occur mainly in the variable region V7, but expansions
were observed in the variable region V8 for some
sequences. The newly obtained SSU rRNA phylotypes
were added to a general alignment of eukaryotes, including most complete or nearly complete sequences from
EES available in GenBank. Sequences from cultured
organisms were selected so that all major taxonomic
groups of eukaryotes were represented; only extremely
divergent lineages such as microsporidia and metamonads were omitted. Manual alignment of our sequences
allowed the identification of 10 chimeras, which were initially detected because different regions of the same
sequence contained rare substitutions and/or indels that
are specific for different groups of eukaryotes. Distance
analyses based on different subsets of unambiguously
aligned regions (partial treeing analysis [12]) were then
used to confirm the chimeric nature of these sequences
(see Additional file 1 for detailed examples of how we
detected chimeric sequences).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/2/13

The phylogenetic position of the 48 non-chimeric phylotypes from our samples was assessed by minimum evolution analyses. Results are illustrated in Figure 1 (see
Additional file 2 for a summary of the identification of all
81 sequences). The tree shown in Figure 1A is the result of
an analysis of 86 partial eukaryotic SSU rRNA gene
sequences, including five selected environmental phylotypes from previous studies. A total of 670 unambiguously aligned positions were included, and the GTR + G
model of evolution was used (alpha = 0.37). Because of
the short size of the amplified fragment, some phylogenetic signal was lost and the monophyly of cercozoans
and fungi was not retrieved. Almost all phylotypes belong
to already known eukaryotic groups. Their relative proportions are illustrated in Figure 1B. Only two phylotypes
(Sey010 and Sey017, represented by ten and two
sequences, respectively) belong to a yet undetermined,
fast-evolving eukaryotic lineage (Figure 1A). They clearly
correspond to already published environmental
sequences from deep-sea Antarctic plankton (DH148-5EKD18 [3]), from the Guaymas Basin hydrothermal vent
(CS_R003 [7]), and from anoxic, marine sediments collected in Bolinas Tidal Flat (BOL1 cluster [5]). These phylotypes were screened by eye in search for rare sequence
signatures that would support their inclusion in already
known eukaryotic groups, but none could be detected,
suggesting that this lineage might represent a novel highlevel taxon.
In the second part of this work, we re-analysed 403 complete or nearly complete published environmental
sequences, representing 289 distinct phylotypes. We
focused on 28 phylotypes that could not be attributed to
known groups of eukaryotes. First, our general alignment
was screened by eye for the presence of specific sequence
signatures, as described above. It is noteworthy that several previously undetected chimeras were identified in
that way, among which three phylotypes were considered
as novel high-level taxa, and this result was confirmed by
partial treeing analysis. The phylogenetic position of all
non-chimeric phylotypes was analysed using Bayesian
methods (Figures 2, 3, and 4; see Additional file 3 for a
summary of the identification of all 403 sequences). In
order to avoid the loss of important informative sites,
none of our partial sequences were included in these analyses. The tree shown in Figure 2 is the result of a Bayesian
analysis of 125 eukaryotic SSU rRNA gene sequences,
including a selection of 56 phylotypes from environmental surveys. A total of 1,175 unambiguously aligned positions were included, and the GTR + G model of evolution
was used (alpha = 0.44). Since resolution within alveolates and opisthokonts was poor (using only 1,175 sites),
two additional datasets were designed to refine evolutionary relationships within these supergroups. Figure 3
presents the result of a Bayesian analysis of 77 alveolate

Discussion
Our study, based on a detailed visual screening of an
exhaustive alignment of SSU rRNA gene sequences of
eukaryotes and the phylogenetic re-analysis of previously
published environmental sequences using Bayesian methods, shows that at least 18 of the 28 previously published
phylotypes proposed to represent novel high-level eukaryotic diversity were misidentified (Table 1). Three main
sources of errors are responsible for this situation.
Undetected chimeric sequences
When performing PCR amplifications of SSU rRNA genes
on total environmental DNA extracts, chimeric sequences
are easily formed because highly conserved regions of
ribosomal genes can anneal even between sequences from
distantly related organisms. As a result, chimeras can represent a relatively large proportion of environmental
sequences [12,13]. In our samples, at least 10 out of the
58 phylotypes we obtained (about 17%) could be identi-

fied as chimeras (see Additional file 2). Comparison with
previous studies are difficult, because although most
authors checked for the presence of chimeric sequences in
their data, some do not indicate precisely how many
clones were sequenced and how many of them were chimeras. However, we found at least 40 undetected chimeras among previously published environmental
sequences, of which three of the phylotypes are considered as novel high-level taxa (Figure 5, Table 1). The fact
that chimeras represent about 14% of the 289 phylotypes
we re-analysed is of concern, given that chimeric
sequences are a source of artifactual diversity and can bias
phylogenetic reconstructions [14].
These results support the idea that the methods generally
used for the identification of chimeras might be misleading [13]. In order to detect potential chimeric sequences,
programs such as CHECK_CHIMERA [15] can be used.
However, the efficiency of these programs depends largely
on the completeness of the databases. When a chimera is
composed of two parts for which no closely related
sequences are available, then either part will have low
similarity to all sequences in the database. Furthermore,
the asymmetric composition of some chimeric sequences
– that is, chimeras in which the putative breakpoint is very
close to one extremity of the sequence – can limit drastically the available signal for their detection. Of the 10 chimeras we detected in our sequences, only five could be
unambiguously
identified
as
such
using
CHECK_CHIMERA. A thorough visual checking of all
putative new phylotypes for the presence of specific
sequence tags might thus prove a more efficient way to
detect chimeras.

artifactually attracted to each other in phylogenetic trees
[17]. In the case of eukaryotic phylogenies, this is especially problematic when prokaryotic sequences are used to
root the trees, because distant outgroup sequences act as
long branches [18]. The resulting topologies often merely
correspond to a 'sequential attachment of longer and
longer branches in the absence of any evolutionary signal'
[19]. A possible solution to this problem is to avoid the
use of prokaryotic outgroup sequences in eukaryotic phylogenies. We recently used this approach to demonstrate
the relationship between Foraminifera and Cercozoa, in
spite of the extreme SSU rRNA gene divergence between
both groups [20]. Besides, the rapid accumulation of SSU
rRNA sequences in the databases constantly diminishes
the risks of LBA artifacts in phylogenetic analyses. With an
increasing taxonomic sampling, the chances of finding
slowly evolving taxa closely related to the fast-evolving
ones increase. This can hopefully help to position correctly the long branches in the trees. However, the
problem of the position of the root persists in the case of
phylogenetic analyses performed without obvious outgroup sequences because it can still be argued that the
root lies along the stem-branch of one of the apparently
fast-evolving lineages. Other evidence, such as rare
genomic rearrangements, should hopefully help resolving
this problem. Following recent hypotheses on the position of the root of the eukaryotic tree [21,22], we decided
to root our eukaryotic phylogeny between unikonts
(opisthokonts + Amoebozoa) and bikonts. Under these
conditions, we are confident that the topology obtained
best reflects the true phylogenetic signal present in the
sequences, and that LBA artifacts are minimized.

Long-branch attraction artifacts
The high heterogeneity of the rates of substitution in the
SSU rRNA gene sequences of eukaryotes is a second source
of errors for an accurate evaluation of the diversity in EES.
López-García et al. [8] showed that the two undetermined
phylotypes BOLA267 [5] and C3_E014 [7] belong to
some as yet undescribed, fast-evolving, apicomplexan lineage. We decided to screen the 23 remaining non-chimeric, undetermined phylotypes by eye to look for rare
sequence signatures that would also support their
inclusion in already known eukaryotic supergroups. At
least eight sequences displayed such signatures, suggesting that they are not representatives of novel high-level,
taxonomic diversity, but fast-evolving members of wellknown groups, such as lobose amoebae or apicomplexan
alveolates. These results were strongly confirmed by our
Bayesian analyses, which correctly placed all 8 sequences
(Figures 2 and 3; Table 1).

Incomplete molecular sampling of described eukaryotes
The incompleteness of molecular databases for known
eukaryotes is a third source of misinterpretation of the
results of EES. The identification of molecular phylotypes
as novel eukaryotic groups is correct only if we can be sure
that these phylotypes do not belong to some described,
but as yet unsequenced eukaryotes. Unfortunately, the
proportion of eukaryotic taxa for which no molecular data
exist is still relatively high. To our knowledge, SSU rRNA
data are available only for about 35 of the 170 genera
considered as amoebae and flagellates of uncertain affinities in a recent taxonomic review of protists [23]. Besides,
no molecular data exist yet for some higher-level, morphologically well-defined taxa, such as the Hemimastigophora, the testate, lobose Arcellinida, or for some
members of the polyphyletic heliozoans, and for many
families of the testate, filose amoebae and the so-called
'ramicristate amoebae' (gymnamoebae) [23], whose
monophyly is uncertain.

Because of the well-known long-branch attraction (LBA)
phenomenon [16], fast-evolving sequences tend to be

There are several examples that show how the putatively
novel eukaryotic phyla disappear with publication of new

sequences. When Edgcomb et al. [7] published their
results, no SSU rRNA sequences from jakobid flagellates
were available, and data on other so-called excavate taxa
were scarce. Re-analysis of their sequences in light of the
results published by Simpson et al. [24] reveals that two of
the phylotypes that previously did not show any close
resemblance to molecularly described groups of eukaryotes (CS_E022 and C1_E027) turned out to be related to
Jakoba incarcerata and the clade comprising Carpediemonas
+ Retortamonas + diplomonads, respectively (Figure 2).
Similarly, the phylotype AT4-11 [9] is related to the apusomonad Amastigomonas (Figure 2). The same applies to
the potential new diversity within known eukaryotic
supergroups. Dawson and Pace [5] obtained three
sequences forming a novel alveolate lineage near apicomplexans (BOLA176, BOLA553, and BOLA914). In light of
the results published by Kuvardina et al. [25], Leander et
al. [26] showed that it corresponds to the family Colpodellidae. Likewise, we recently obtained the first SSU
rRNA gene sequence from the heliozoan-like Sticholonche
zanclea [27]. This sequence turned out to be closely related
to Acantharea and Polycystinea (data not shown), and it
corresponds to the previously published environmental
'radiolarian' phylotypes DH145-KW16 [28] and CS_E043
[7]. Obtaining molecular data on a comprehensive sampling of described protists is thus of prime importance to
avoid over-interpretation of the diversity revealed by EES.

good PCR amplifications even from cultured organisms
(A. Smirnov, personal communication). It is not surprising that these eukaryotes are rarely found in EES.

Other pitfalls of eukaryotic environmental DNA surveys
The correct identification of higher-level phyla is only one
of the problems related to EES. Another obvious problem
is the accurateness of the diversity inferred from EES data.
Whether molecular surveys correctly represent the eukaryotic diversity in a given biotope is of crucial importance
for inferring accurate ecological conclusions from the
samples. Foraminifera are a good example of an important taxonomic group that is absent in all environmental
surveys reported so far, although they are present in both
planktonic and benthic marine biotopes, as well as in
freshwater biotopes, including the small river we sampled
[29]. This may be due to the extreme divergence of
foraminiferan ribosomal genes, which cannot be directly
amplified with most known universal primers [30],
although other explanations, such as a low abundance of
Foraminifera in the samples, cannot be discarded. Apart
from sequence divergence, the wide range of possible
lengths for eukaryotic SSU rRNA genes can also be an
important limiting factor during PCR amplifications or
cloning. Even with appropriate primers, it is doubtful that
complete SSU rRNA gene sequences of more than 3,000
nucleotides, such as those of most foraminiferans, many
euglenozoans, and some amoebozoans, would amplify or
be cloned in the presence of competing sequences of normal length. Finally, in case of some eukaryotes (lobose
amoebae, actinophryid heliozoans) it is difficult to obtain

Identifying novel eukaryotic lineages
After carefully re-analyzing most available near full-length
environmental eukaryotic sequences, we found that the
number of supposedly novel higher-level phylotypes that
cannot be included in defined eukaryotic supergroups is
much smaller than enthusiastically proclaimed by the
authors of some previous studies [5,7] (see Figure 5 and
Table 1). Among 28 phylotypes, three were identified as
chimeras, 10 were misplaced fast-evolving sequences, and
five were identified after new molecular data on described
eukaryotes became available. Among the remaining 10
candidates,
three
phylotypes
(DH148-5-EKD18,
CS_R003, BOLA048) from three different EES form a
strongly supported clade with two of the phylotypes we
obtained in our samples (Sey010 and Sey017), suggesting
that they belong to a group of organisms present in all
types of environment (Figures 1 and 2). Another candidate cluster that passed our checking procedure comprises
the phylotypes C3_E012 and C2_E026 [7] and the BOL2
cluster [5] (Figure 2). Finally, three isolated phylotypes
from previous EES might also represent novel high-level
diversity: AT4-68 [8], DH145-EKD11 [3], and BAQA065
[5] (Figure 2).

In our EES of the River Seymaz, we decided to amplify
only the second half of the SSU rRNA gene, which is
generally more conserved both in sequence length and
primary structure, in the hope of avoiding negative competition against SSU rRNA gene sequences of unusual
length or high divergence. The analysis of our data reveals
the presence of many common eukaryotic groups, including ciliates, cercozoans, chlorophytes, diatoms, and fungi,
which are expected to be present in a freshwater environment like the small river, the Seymaz (Figure 1, Additional
file 2). However, some groups of common protists that
were repeatedly observed microscopically in the same area
over previous years, such as lobose amoebae and euglenozoans (R. Peck, personal communication), were widely
under-represented or even absent from the sequences we
obtained (Figure 1, Additional file 2). We suspect that this
discrepancy might also apply to previously published EES
of marine biotopes. The use of several combinations of
universal and/or specific primers, coupled with the use of
a range of different PCR conditions, might allow a more
realistic qualitative sample of the diversity of organisms
present in a given biotope, although this would never be
guaranteed.

Although these phylotypes passed our checking, it is premature to claim that they truly represent novel eukaryotic
kingdoms. First, we cannot exclude the possibility that the

BMC Biology 2004, 2

three phylotypes represented by single sequences are
amplification artifacts, especially in the case of the
extremely divergent sequence BAQA065, or as yet undetected chimeras. It is also uncertain what the real nature of
the two clusters of undetermined phylotypes is. The fact
that sequences belonging to these two clades were independently found in several different EES indicates that
they probably represent real taxonomic lineages. With an
increasing taxonomic sampling and/or the development
of better phylogenetic tools, it might ultimately be possible to link these clusters with already known groups of
eukaryotes. In the tree shown in Figure 2, all fast-evolving
phylotypes of unknown affiliation are grouped in a clade
that also includes the jakobid flagellates and the discicristates (Heterolobosea + Euglenozoa). Because these
sequences are fast evolving (especially the clade present in
our samples), we cannot exclude the possibility that their
grouping in the tree is the result of LBA artifacts that even
Bayesian analyses and a large taxa sampling could not
avoid. Supposing that this is not the case, however, these
phylotypes might belong to the recently proposed supergroup of excavates [31]. Alternatively, these sequences
might belong to some extremely fast-evolving apicomplexan parasites, as suggested by some distance analyses performed on a larger dataset (data not shown), and as
proposed by Cavalier-Smith [32] in a similar, simultaneous study. No clear sequence signature could be detected
to support the inclusion of any of these phylotypes in the
apicomplexan alveolates. However, such signatures are
secondarily absent in some of the fastest evolving
sequences of gregarines known to date. Finally, it is possible that these sequences represent as yet unrecognized
nucleomorphs, which are generally characterized by rapid
rates of substitution [33].
Whatever hypothesis is correct, the influence of LBA will
be difficult to disprove convincingly in the case of such
fast-evolving sequences. Therefore, the only way to ascertain the nature of these putative novel high-level taxa is to
identify them in environmental samples using such
approaches as the fluorescent in situ hybridization. This
technique was successfully used by Massana et al. [10] to
identify representatives of two novel lineages of stramenopiles. One of these lineages was shown to be an important
component of the total stock of bacterial grazers in a
coastal environment [10]. Similarly, the novel eukaryotic
lineages that might be revealed with this approach might
turn out to be quantitatively and/or ecologically important members of the biotopes to which they belong.
How large is the novel eukaryotic mega-diversity?
The fact that most of the new phylotypes discovered in
EES can be attributed to already known supergroups of
eukaryotes is not surprising given the new view of eukaryotic evolution that is emerging from recent analyses of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/2/13

multigenic databases [34,35]. Following this view, most
of the eukaryotic diversity can be distributed into eight
'supergroups' [36], with a limited number of possibly
independent, smaller, high-level lineages such as apusozoans or centroheliozoans [37-39]. Most of the taxa that
were traditionally considered early diverging branches of
the eukaryotic tree [40] are now seen as highly derived
members of groups belonging to the so-called crown of
eukaryotes [41]. It seems, therefore, that the eukaryotes, in
terms of cytological innovations and fundamental body
plans, are much less diverse than previously thought; the
opposite view that emerged at the dawn of the molecular
systematics era was strongly biased by LBA artifacts. Furthermore, the whole diversity of eukaryotes may even be
reduced to a single basal bifurcation between unikonts
and bikonts [22]. However, the existence among extant
eukaryotes of truly ancient lineages predating the
unikont/bikont divergence cannot be excluded. The detection of such early diverging organisms, if they exist, might
prove difficult and necessitate different molecular
approaches, such as the use of randomly modified eukaryotic primers. In this respect, the use of cultivation-independent identification of eukaryotes by PCR
amplification of SSU rRNA gene sequences should not be
neglected, provided that results of such EES are correctly
interpreted, and the pitfalls discussed in our study are
circumvented.

Conclusions
Environmental DNA surveys undoubtedly contribute to
unraveling many novel eukaryotic lineages. In view of our
results, however, there is no clear evidence for a spectacular increase of the diversity at a megaevolutionary level.
This is in agreement with the recent view of eukaryotic
evolution, proposing that most of the known diversity of
eukaryotes can be attributed to a relatively small number
of 'supergroups'. After re-analysis of previously published
data, we found only five candidate lineages of possibly
novel high-level eukaryotic taxa, four of which are typically fast evolving. Only two of these lineages comprise
several phylotypes that were found independently in different studies, suggesting that they represent real taxonomic lineages. To ascertain their taxonomic status,
however, the organisms themselves must now be
identified.

Methods
Sediment was sampled in the small river, the Seymaz
(Geneva, Switzerland), in May and June, 2002. Total DNA
extractions were performed following a protocol modified
from Zhou et al. [42], as detailed in Holzmann et al. [29].
A fragment of about one half of the SSU rRNA gene was
amplified by PCR with the universal primers s12.2 (5'GATYAGATACCGTCGTAGTC-3') and sB (5'-TGATCCTTCTGCAGGTTCACCTAC-3'). PCR amplifications, purifi-

cations, cloning and sequencing were done as described
elsewhere [43].
SSU rRNA gene sequences were aligned manually with the
Genetic Data Environment software, version 2.2 [44], following a secondary structure model [45]. Chimeras were
identified by visual screening of the alignment in search of
contradictory sequence signatures, and confirmed by partial treeing analysis [12,46]. PAUP* [47] was used for
minimum evolution analyses using the GTR model of
substitution [48,49], and taking into account a gammashaped distribution of the rates of substitution among
sites, with eight rate categories. Maximum likelihood-corrected estimates of the distances were used, and parameters were estimated from the dataset. Bayesian analyses
were performed with MrBayes, version 3.0b4 [50], using
the GTR + G model, as above. For each dataset, the chains
were run for 2,500,000 generations, and 25,000 trees were
sampled. The first 5,000 sampled trees, corresponding to
the initial phase before the chains reach stationarity
(burn-in), were discarded. The reliability of internal
branches was assessed using the posterior probabilities
(PP) calculated with MrBayes. Alternatively, the bootstrap
method [51] was used with 10,000 replicates for minimum evolution analyses, as described above. The 48 nonchimeric phylotypes reported in this paper have been
deposited in the EMBL/GenBank database under accession numbers AY605183 to AY605230.
