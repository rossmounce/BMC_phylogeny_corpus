Abstract
Background: The mitochondrial genome of Metazoa is usually a compact molecule without
introns. Exceptions to this rule have been reported only in corals and sea anemones (Cnidaria), in
which group I introns have been discovered in the cox1 and nad5 genes. Here we show several lines
of evidence demonstrating that introns can also be found in the mitochondria of sponges (Porifera).
Results: A 2,349 bp fragment of the mitochondrial cox1 gene was sequenced from the sponge
Tetilla sp. (Spirophorida). This fragment suggests the presence of a 1143 bp intron. Similar to all the
cnidarian mitochondrial introns, the putative intron has group I intron characteristics. The intron
is present in the cox1 gene and encodes a putative homing endonuclease. In order to establish the
distribution of this intron in sponges, the cox1 gene was sequenced from several representatives of
the demosponge diversity. The intron was found only in the sponge order Spirophorida. A
phylogenetic analysis of the COI protein sequence and of the intron open reading frame suggests
that the intron may have been transmitted horizontally from a fungus donor.
Conclusion: Little is known about sponge-associated fungi, although in the last few years the latter
have been frequently isolated from sponges. We suggest that the horizontal gene transfer of a
mitochondrial intron was facilitated by a symbiotic relationship between fungus and sponge.
Ecological relationships are known to have implications at the genomic level. Here, an ecological
relationship between sponge and fungus is suggested based on the genomic analysis.

Background
Sponges (Porifera) are the first diverging metazoans. They
are thus a key phylum in the understanding of the
genomic characteristics of the metazoan ancestor [1]. For
example, recent findings indicate that the sponge mitochondria possess ancestral characters that have been lost
in other metazoans, such as additional genes, minimally
modified genetic code, or bacteria-like rRNA structure
[2,3]. One intriguing finding is that most metazoan mitochondrial genomes lack introns. Mitochondrial introns

may be present in large numbers and in many genes in the
sister clades of Metazoa: Choanoflagellida [4], Ichthyosporea [4] and Fungi [5]. For example, the mitochondrial genome of the fungi Podospora anserina (accession
number: NC_001329) contains 33 introns located in nine
different genes, including 15 introns in the cox1 gene,
which encode the subunit 1 of cytochrome c oxidase
(COI). However, none of these introns are obligatory and
some fungi do not include introns in their mitochondrial
genome (e.g., Schizophyllum commune, NC_003049; HarPage 1 of 11

pochytrium sp. NC_004760 and NC_004623). In Metazoa,
mitochondrial introns have only been described in Cnidaria of the subclass Zoantharia [6,7]. In sea anemones
(order Actinaria), two mitochondrial introns have been
found, one in the cox1 gene and one in the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 gene (nd5). In stony corals (order
Scleractinia), however, only the nd5 gene contains an
intron. The relative position of this intron is conserved
between sea anemone and stony corals. Other cnidarians
(e.g., jellyfish, hydras) do not seem to possess mitochondrial introns [8,9].
Mitochondrial introns are self-splicing ribozymes. Selfsplicing introns are divided into either Group I or Group
II depending on their secondary structure. While Group II
introns are prevalent in plants, the mitochondrial introns
of Cnidaria, Choanoflagellida and Ichtyosporea are all of
group I. In the mitochondria of fungi both types of
introns can be found, though group I is more prevalent
[5]. Self-splicing introns are mobile genetic elements
[5,10,11]. They often encode homing endonucleases and/
or maturases. Homing endonucleases cleave chromosomes and exploit the recombinational repair system of
the cell for their multiplication. Maturases act as cofactors
that bind the precursor RNA containing their intron to
facilitate its folding and splicing [12]. It should be noted
that enzymes of the LAGLIDADG family (which are frequently encoded within group I introns) can function as
endonuclease, as maturase, or perform both functions.
However, not all introns encode homing endonuclease or
maturase. For example, the peculiar intron located in the
nd5 gene of cnidaria does not encode a homing endonuclease, although it encodes other mitochondrial genes
[6,7].
Although three mitochondrial genomes of sponges have
been recently sequenced [2,3], no intron was found in
these genomes. We report here that a sponge mitochondrial gene contains a group I intron, which encodes a
putative LAGLIDADG member. We also provide phylogenetic evidence suggesting that the sponge intron was
acquired by horizontal gene transfer.

Results
We amplified cox1 genes from nine demosponge species.
All sponge species yielded similar cox1 PCR products
(1206 bp) except Tetilla sp. (Spirophorida), whose product was much longer (2349 bp). Sequencing this gene
revealed a putative intron of 1143 bp. This suggests that
introns can also be found in the mitochondrial genome of
sponges. Interestingly, the intron was located in the middle of the reverse primer used by Nichols et al. [13] to
amplify cox1 gene of sponges. It is highly unlikely that the
Tetilla cox1 sequence is a nuclear copy or a contamination,
for three reasons: i. we extracted enriched mitochondrial

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/71

DNA to avoid amplification of nuclear copies of mitochondrial sequences (Numts) [14]; ii. no frameshift mutations were noticeable in the cox1 sequence; and iii. an
identical sequence was obtained from two individuals collected from separate locations.
Characteristics of the predicted Tetilla sp. intron
A study of the relative position of introns in the cox1 gene
(Figure 1) revealed that the Tetilla sp. intron is inserted at
position 850 of the alignment provided in Additional file
1. This insertion point corresponds to positions 672–673
of the cox1 coding sequence (CDS) of Tetilla. Unlike the
Tetilla intron, the sea anemone intron is located at position 1017 of the alignment (positions 835–836 of the
cox1 CDS of Tetilla). In fact, no intron (among fungal,
choanoflagellate and ichtyosporean cox1 sequences) was
found to be inserted at exactly the same nucleotide position as the predicted sponge intron. However, introns are
located at positions 834, 846 and 859 of the alignment
(i.e., 8 bp after the Tetilla intron insertion point), thus suggesting a hot spot for intron insertion (Figure 1).

Secondary structure predictions show that the Tetilla
intron can be folded into a canonical group I intron,
except for the absence of the paired region P2 (Figure 2).
A BLAST analysis reveals that the predicted intron
sequence shows low primary sequence similarity with
sequences present in the data banks. However, the conserved P, Q, R, and S regions, which form the main core of
group I introns, can be aligned between the Tetilla intron
and fungal mitochondrial introns. In Figure 3 we compare
the core region of the Tetilla intron with the core region of
eight other introns. Five of these introns were chosen
because their encoded LAGLIDADG was closely related to
the Tetilla's LAGLIDADG (see below). We also included in
the comparison the three available animal introns with
published secondary structure [6,7]. Interestingly, the
introns that include closely related LAGLIDADGs (i.e.,
Agrocybe aegerita cox1 intron 2, Emericella nidulans cox1
intron 3, Schizosaccharomyces pombe cox1 intron 2, Penicillium marneffrei cox1 intron 3) do not include the paired
region P2. Unfortunately, the presence or absence of P2
could not be reliably determined for the cox1 intron 4 of
Smittium culisetae. The absence of P2 paired-region in
closely related introns suggests that the absence of P2 is
genuine in the Tetilla intron and not an artifact produced
by the method used. The cnidarian introns, in contrast,
contain a P2 region, suggesting that they are less related to
the Tetilla intron than the fungal introns mentioned
above.
Mitochondrial introns often encode various proteins
[7,15]. Hence, the predicted Tetilla intron was translated
in all six reading frames using the coelenterate/mold
mitochondrial genetic code (i.e., the genetic code of

sponge mitochondria). The translation revealed an open
reading frame (ORF) of 1029 bp starting from the first
nucleotide of the intron (the initiation codon is TTA). The
main difference between the standard and the sponge
mitochondrial genetic codes is that TGA codes for a stop
codon in the standard genetic code while in the sponge
mitochondria it codes for tryptophan. The intron ORF
includes three TGA codons in positions 100, 169, and 631
of the intron sequence, indicating that the coding
sequence of the intron is not of a nuclear origin.
The BLAST analysis of the ORF suggests that it encodes an
enzyme from the LAGLIDADG endonuclease-maturase
family. LAGLIDADG is the largest family of homing endonucleases, whose members are characterized by the presence of the conserved motif LAGLIDADG in one or two
copies. Crystal structures of LAGLIDADG endonucleasesmaturases have revealed that single-motif proteins function as homodimers while double-motif enzymes are

monomers [10]. Two LAGLIDADG motifs were identified
in the Tetilla ORF (LAGLIEGDG and LAGFLDADG)
located in positions 101–109 and 212–220 of the ORF
protein sequence.
Phylogenetic tree of the COI protein sequence
To confirm that the Tetilla sequence was not a fungal contamination, a phylogenetic tree of Metazoa and its closest
sister clades (i.e., Fungi and Choanoflagellida) was reconstructed based on COI protein sequences (Figure 4) and
was rooted with fungal sequences. The resulting phylogeny is in agreement with previous phylogenetic trees
based on mitochondrial sequences [2]. As expected, animals are monophyletic (Bootstrap percentage, BP = 100,
Posterior probability PP = 1.0) and divided into two
clades: Diploblastica (Porifera+Cnidaria; BP = 99, PP =
1.0) and Bilateria (BP = 100, PP = 1.0). The monophyly of
diploblasts contradicts the RNA-based phylogenies that
place sponges at the base of Metazoa [16-19]. The mono-

phyly of diploblasts is likely to be the consequence of a
long branch artefact resulting from the high rate of evolution of Bilateria [2]. The relationships within these two
clades are not highly supported. Bilateria are divided into
Protostomia (BP = 52 PP = 0.74) and Deuterostomia (BP
= 67 PP = 0.98). Diploblasts are divided into Cnidaria (BP

= 89 PP = 1.0) and Demospongiae (BP = 71). The Bayesian reconstruction does not support the monophyly of
Porifera but instead places Cnidaria as the sister clade of
Xestospongia (PP = 0.56). Thus, although the Bayesian and
Maximum Likelihood (ML) trees support slightly different
topologies, those differences only involve weakly sup-

54–57]. The core region of the cox1 intron 4 of Smittium culisetae was determined using the program CITRON [45]. As suggested in the program manual the parameters that constrain the minimal definition of (P3, P3') were lowered, since no putative
intron was found using the default parameters. Specifically, T10 was set to 3 and T11 to 15. The location of the P1 paired
region and the presence or absence of the P2 paired region were not determined for Smittium.

common in the nuclear genome and in this case they are
associated with self-splicing inteins rather than introns
[10,15,24]. The most similar sequences to the intron ORF
of Tetilla, according to the BLAST search, are the LAGLIDADG sequences located in the cox1 gene of fungi.
Among the 85 non-identical sequences analyzed, only 17
sequences (20%) were not cox1 sequences (Figure 5).
These 17 sequences originated either from chloroplastic
introns of algae (6 sequences) or from mitochondrial
introns located in the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5
(nd5; 8 sequences), small-subunit rRNA (srrna; 1
sequence), ATP synthase subunit 1 (atp1; 1 sequence), and
cytochrome b (cytb; 1 sequence) genes. Similarly, only 16
sequences did not originate from fungi but from green
algae (9 sequences), Embryophyta (3 sequences), Choanoflagellida (2 sequences), Ichthyosporea (1 sequence),
and Metazoa (1 sequence).

ported nodes (i.e., nodes with BP<50% or PP<0.95; data
not shown). Among Porifera, Tetilla sp. (order Spirophorida) clusters with Geodia (order Astrophorida) with high
support values (BP = 100 PP = 1.0). This relationship is in
agreement with traditional morphology-based classification and rRNA sequence analyses, which group the orders
Astrophorida and Spirophorida together [20-22]. Sponge
relationships show very low support value. Among the
three orders represented by two species each (Poescilosclerida, Hadromerida, Verongida) only Verongida
appears as monophyletic (BP = 100 PP = 1.0). Because
relationships within sponges are not highly supported in
both ML and Bayesian analyses, it is unknown whether
the paraphyly of these genera reflects sponge history or
lack of phylogenetic signal in the COI sequences.
Phylogenetic tree of the LAGLIDADG
LAGLIDADG genes are present in all branches of the tree
of life. Among eukaryotes they are widespread in the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes and usually associated with group I introns although they have also been
found to be encoded by group II introns [23]. They are less

Phylogenetic reconstructions indicate a complicated evolutionary history for these homing endonuclease
sequences (Figure 5). Because the LAGLIDADG protein
tree has little to do with the species tree it was impossible
to define an outgroup. In the tree, the predicted Tetilla
sequence is associated with the LAGLIDADG sequence
located in the 4th cox1 intron of Smittium culisetae. However, these two sequences show only 57% of identity in
the conserved part of the LAGLIDADG alignment and the
support values are weak for this grouping (BP = 54 and PP
= 0.94). Similarly, the LAGLIDADG sequence present in
the sea anemone Metridium senile does not show any close
relationship with any of the sequences present in the data
bank. More generally, intron sequences present in the
same gene or in closely-related organisms do not form
monophyletic groups. For example, neither chloroplast
sequences nor animal sequences clustered together. Only
the plant sequences (BP = 100, PP = 1.0) and five nd5
sequences (BP = 97, PP = 1.0) form two coherent groups.

Discussion
Insertion and deletion of mobile introns are common
evolutionary events resulting in a sporadic distribution of
these elements [5]. Consequently, the presence of an
intron in a lineage but not in its sister clades can always be
explained by independent losses. However, three lines of
evidence suggest that the predicted Tetilla sp. intron arose
by horizontal gene transfer rather than by independent
losses. First, parsimony analysis of intron presence and
absence favors a scenario of a recent intron introduction
in Spirophorida since all other ten sponges for which the
cox1 gene was determined lack an intron (Figure 4). Second, the cnidarian intron is not located at the same position as the sponge intron, suggesting an independent
evolutionary origin (Figure 1). Third, phylogenetic analyses clearly show that the intron-encoded LAGLIDADG
sequence and the cox1 exonic sequence share different

phylogenetic histories (Figures 4, 5). The Tetilla COI protein is of sponge origin and its phylogeny agrees with previous sponge molecular phylogeny [21,25], while the
LAGLIDADG-based phylogenetic tree indicates that the
Tetilla intron ORF is closer to fungal than to cnidarian or
choanoflagelate sequences (Figure 5). Thus, the intron
might be of fungal origin.
It is unlikely that the intron was transferred from the
nuclear genome. The ORF can be translated with the
sponge/mold/cnidarian mitochondrial genetic code but
not with the nuclear genetic code. The mitochondrial origin of this sequence is also supported by the fact that the
ORF sequence is more similar to cox1 LAGLIDADG than
to ribosomal LAGLIDADG (Figure 5).
We predicted the first sponge mitochondrial intron and
our phylogenetic analyses indicate that it might have a
fungal origin. A fungal origin implies that the sponge and
the donor interacted in such a way as to allow the transfer
of the intron. This suggests the existence of a symbiosis
between Tetilla sp. and a fungus donor of the intron.
There is an increasing interest recently in marine fungi as
a source of novel bioactive-compounds [26]. More than
500 species of marine fungi, mainly Ascomycota, have
been described [27,28] and the number is constantly rising [29-31]. Unfortunately, no cox1 gene has yet been
sequenced from marine derived fungi. In the marine environment, fungi have been isolated from sediments, algae,
plants, fish, crabs, tunicates, corals, and sponges [26,32].
In spite of the fact that many fungi had been isolated from
sponges [32-35], the existence of a sponge-fungus symbiosis is under debate. No fungi had been observed within
a sponge and it was therefore supposed that only dormant
fungi propagules are present within sponges. The first
clear case of an endosymbiotic yeast was recently discovered in sponges of the genus Chondrilla [36]. Additionally,
another recent molecular study gave the first proof that
sponges have the ability to recognize fungi in their surrounding environment [37]. Our results thus introduce
additional evidence in favor of a sponge-fungus symbiosis.
Because horizontal gene transfers of group I introns
encoding LAGLIDADG are frequent among fungi, we
could not determine which lineage of fungi was at the origin of the sponge intron. The sponge LAGLIDADG
sequence clusters with the LAGLIDADG present in the
fourth cox1 intron of Smittium culisetae. However, the location of the LAGLIDADG ORF is different in these two
introns (Figure 3). Most of the ORF is located in the paired
region P8 in Tetilla while in Smittium it is located before
the paired region P3. This suggests that the ORF and the
rest of the intron (i.e., the ribozyme component) have

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/71

independent origins, thus complicating our understanding of the sponge intron origin. Because the diversity of
marine organisms is still poorly known and because
sponges are remarkable for their widespread symbiosis
with various organisms [38,39], we cannot exclude the
hypothesis that an unknown unicellular eukaryote was
the donor of the intron. The accumulation of new data on
marine fungi mitochondrial genomes is likely to shed
additional light on the sponge intron origin and perhaps
also on the origin of the LAGLIDADG sequence in Cnidaria.

Conclusion
Our analysis suggests that a cross-kingdom horizontal
gene transfer event occurred in the sponge mitochondrial
genome. Such events are remarkable from the evolutionary point of view, because they demonstrate an unexpected plasticity of the mitochondrial genomes of basal
Metazoa compared to the more conserved genomes of
Bilateria. Porifera and Cnidaria mtDNAs have been characterized by the presence of additional horizontally-transferred genes [6,40], introns [6,7], tRNA duplications [3],
and tRNA losses [7,41]. Our results suggest that a better
sampling of these animals might improve our understanding of the evolution of this genome.
There are many exciting evolutionary events in marine
organisms that are only now starting to be discovered, and
these events will provide new insights concerning the evolution of the animal kingdom. Ecological relationships
are known to have implications at the genomic level.
Here, an ecological relationship between a sponge and a
fungus (or an unknown eukaryote) is suggested, based on
the genomic analysis.

Methods
DNA extraction and amplification
Eight sponge species were collected and identified by traditional morphological taxonomy based on their general
morphology and skeletal organization. Total DNA extractions from the sponge species Xestospongia proxima,
Biemna fistulosa, Cliona sp., Verongula giganthea, and
Aplysina lacunosa were performed following Steindler et al.
[42]. For Tetilla sp., Negombata magnifica, and Chondrosia
reniformis, an enriched fraction of mitochondrial genomes
was extracted following Arnason et al. [43]. This protocol
reduces the chance of Numt contamination.

The primers LCO1490 [44] and COX1-R1 (5'-TGTTGRGGGAAAAARGTTAAATT-3') were used to amplify the cox1
gene. The conditions of PCR amplifications were: 1 cycle
at 94°C for 2 min, 50°C for 1 min, 72°C for 2 min; 30
cycles at 94°C for 50 sec, 50°C for 50 sec, 72°C for 2 min;
and a final elongation at 72°C for 10 min. Amplified fragments were directly sequenced on an ABI PRISM 3100

Additional file 2.
Intron structure
Intron location and structure were inferred in silico. The
core structure of the intron was inferred with the program
CITRON [45] and manually aligned with fungal and
metazoan introns on the basis of secondary structure prediction. The fungal species chosen were the closest based
on the phylogenetic analyses of LAGLIDADG sequences.
The structure of other regions (i.e., P1, P5, P6, P9) was
predicted using the program Mfold [46].
Phylogenetic analysis
Two protein data sets were analyzed. The first data set
comprised COI protein sequences of representative fungi
and metazoans together with the sponge sequences
obtained in this work (Table 1). Only sequences longer
than 400 amino-acids were considered. The second data
set contained homing endonuclease sequences of the
LAGLIDADG family. These sequences were retrieved following a BLAST search using for query the ORF located in
the cox1 intron of Tetilla sp. Following Hall [[47] p.16] all
sequences with an E-value ≤ 10-5 were taken into account.

Sequences were aligned using ProbCons [48] with three
consistency steps and 500 iterative refinement repetitions.
The alignments were then corrected by hand and gaps
present in more than 25% of the taxa were removed from
the analyses. The COI corrected alignment comprised 24
species and 400 characters while the LAGLIDADG data set
comprised 89 sequences and 263 characters. Both alignments are provided as Additional files 3 and 4. For each
data set two analyses were conducted: a maximum likelihood analysis with the program PHYML v2.4.4 [49] and a
Bayesian analysis with the program MrBayes3.1 [50]. Both
analyses were done using the mtREV amino-acid replacement model [51]. Among-site rate variation was represented by a gamma distribution [52] with eight categories
and a proportion of invariant sites for the COI data set.
The proportion of invariant sites was set to zero for the
LAGLIDADG analysis because preliminary analysis with
PHYML had estimated the proportion of invariant sites to
be very small. For maximum likelihood analyses, bootstrap percentages were computed using 1000 replicates for
the COI data set and 500 replicates for the LAGLIDADG
data set. The Bayesian analyses were performed with two
independent runs. For each run, four chains were sampled
every 100 generations. Each chain was run for 5,000,000
or 6,000,000 generations for the COI and the LAGLIDADG data set respectively. Clade posterior probabilities

(PP) were calculated after removal of the first 12,500 trees
for the COI analysis (burnin). In this case, the average
standard deviation of split frequencies was below 0.01
before the burnin threshold, and the potential scale reduction factors of the parameters were equal to 1. This indicates that the run had probably converged. For the
LAGLIDADG analysis, the average standard deviation of
split frequencies was below 0.01 after 5,100,000 generations. Consequently, the first 51,000 trees were removed
before computation of the clade posterior probabilities.
