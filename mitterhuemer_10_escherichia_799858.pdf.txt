Abstract
Background: Coliform bacteria are the most common etiologic agents in severe mastitis of cows. Escherichia coli
infections are mostly restricted to a single udder quarter whereas neighboring quarters stay clinically inapparent,
implicating the presence of a systemic defense reaction. To address its underlying mechanism, we performed a
transcriptome study of mammary tissue from udder quarters inoculated with E. coli (6 h and 24 h post infection),
from neighboring quarters of the same animals, and from untreated control animals.
Results: After 6 h 13 probe sets of differentially expressed genes (DEG) were detected in infected quarters versus
control animals. Eighteen hours later 2154 and 476 DEG were found in infected and in neighboring quarters vs.
control animals. Cluster analysis revealed DEG found only in infected quarters (local response) and DEG detected in
both infected and neighboring quarters (systemic response). The first group includes genes mainly involved in
immune response and inflammation, while the systemic reaction comprises antigen processing and presentation,
cytokines, protein degradation and apoptosis. Enhanced expression of antimicrobial genes (S100A8, S100A9,
S100A12, CXCL2, GNLY), acute phase genes (LBP, SAA3, CP, BF, C6, C4BPA, IF), and indicators of oxidative stress (GPX3,
MT1A, MT2A, SOD2) point to an active defense reaction in infected and neighboring healthy quarters. Its early onset
is indicated by increased transcription of NFIL3 at 6 h. NFIL3 is a predicted regulator of many genes of the systemic
response at 24 h. The significance of our transcriptome study was evidenced by some recent findings with
candidate gene based approaches.
Conclusions: The discovery and holistic analysis of an extensive systemic reaction in the mammary gland
significantly expands the knowledge of host-pathogen interactions in mastitis which may be relevant for the
development of novel therapies and for genetic selection towards mastitis resistance.

Background
Udder infections cause considerable economic losses to
the dairy industry [1] and often lead to culling of
affected animals [2]. Due to the economic importance of
mastitis and the health risk for consumers, large efforts
have been made to identify factors involved in the susceptibility of dairy cows to infections of the mammary
gland [3,4] which occur most frequently at parturition
[5]. In that period, infections with E. coli often cause
severe clinical symptoms [6,7] accompanied by

reduction in milk yield, altered milk composition and
extensive damage of mammary tissue [8]. E. coli infection predominantly affects a single udder quarter [9].
The other quarters are clinically asymptomatic and are
considered to be healthy. Nevertheless, there are indications that neighboring apparently healthy udder quarters
are infected without showing clinical changes. Epidemiological studies revealed, that the identical environmental
strain of E. coli can cause recurrent mastitis, but in different udder quarters relative to the one infected first
[10]. This phenomenon was attributed to initial infection of multiple quarters, each at a different level and
with variations in lesion development [10].

The symptoms of a defined experimental mastitis vary
between different animals from mild to lethal. Interestingly, the severity of clinical response seems to be relatively characteristic and constant for a given animal, as
shown by repeated infection studies [11]. The most prominent early response of the mammary gland is a dramatic increase in somatic cell numbers in milk
occurring after infusion of E. coli [12] or its lipopolysaccharide [13] solely in the infected udder quarter. Moreover the infection provokes systemic effects as e.g.
evidenced by fever, increased level of TNF-alpha in
blood [14] or enhanced expression of several genes like
haptoglobin in neighboring quarters [15]. In addition, a
systemic reaction is evidenced by altered gene expression in distant organs as shown for liver after infusion
of lipopolysaccharide into the mammary gland [16]. Surprisingly, experimental infection of a second healthy
udder quarter twelve hours after the primary infection
does not change the somatic cell count in this quarter,
while the increase in somatic cell numbers in the first
infected quarter continues [12,17].
These observations favor the concept, that infection
with E. coli provokes two distinct types of response to
the pathogen. The first comprises locally restricted reactions with acute symptoms and inflammation of the
infected udder quarter. The second occurs in infected as
well as in neighboring healthy udder quarters and
furthermore influences even distant organs as shown for
liver [16]. This systemic response may impair progression of subsequent infections of neighboring mammary
quarters [12,17]. The interplay of both local and systemic reactions may finally determine the course of
infection in an individual animal. The elucidation of the
underlying mechanisms may help to improve mastitis
resistance of livestock populations by selective breeding
and reveal new ways to treat infections with E. coli.
Here we present a transcriptome profiling approach to
study the impact of an experimental E. coli infection on
spatial gene expression profiles of the bovine mammary
gland and to distinguish between local and systemic
effects. The experimental system comprises dairy cows
with defined lactation and immune status as hosts and
E. coli 1303 as pathogen. Microarray analyses of mammary gland tissue were performed in the early (6 h) and
the late (24 h) phase of experimental infection. Udder
tissue from healthy, untreated cows served as control
for the discrimination between local and systemic effects
in infected animals. We found, that infection of a single
udder quarter with E. coli 1303 induced substantial transcriptome changes both in the infected and in the
neighboring udder quarters with more than two thousand differentially expressed genes. Cluster analyses of
DEG revealed that two different reactions took place.
The first was locally restricted to the infected quarter

whereas the second occurred systemically in infected as
well as in their neighboring noninfected quarters. Both
reactions were characterized by gene ontology analyses
and by searching of putative regulatory elements in the
promoter regions of the DEG. Our results offer reasonable hypotheses why, after initial infection of one udder
quarter, massive expansion of the bacteria in neighboring quarters is suppressed.

Results
Establishment of intramammary infection

Prior to infection, the udder secretions of all animals
had repeatedly been tested negative for major and
minor mastitis pathogens. Following administration of
500 cfu of E. coli 1303 to a single udder quarter and the
same volume of physiological saline into a neighboring
quarter of each of five cows (Figure 1), all inoculated
animals suffered from acute mastitis and showed a
strong cellular response. Major clinical symptoms, such
as udder swelling and elevated counts of somatic cells in
milk, were restricted to pathogen-inoculated udder
quarters (Figure 2A). All milk samples from the inoculated quarters were positive for E. coli bacteria whereas
neighboring quarters and all quarters of control animals
remained bacteriologically negative during the observation period.
Body temperature, milk yield, differential blood
cell counts

All infected cows developed fever (>39.2°C) within the
first 14 h after infection with maximal values (41.1 ±
0.2°C) between 15 h and 18 h after inoculation (Figure
2B). This was accompanied by significant leukopenia,
reaching minimal blood leukocyte counts 12 h after
pathogen inoculation (Figure 2C). Milk yield dropped
progressively within the 24-h period after infection (Figure 2D), with a stronger decrease in infected quarters
than in neighboring quarters. In infected quarters the
number of somatic cells in milk increased starting
between 6 and 12 h after infection (Figure 2A). In mock
inoculated and untreated neighboring udder quarters of
infected animals no significant increase in the number
of somatic cells was observed.
Microarray analysis

Mammary tissue samples were used to generate four
sets of transcriptome profiles from: i) inoculated quarters 6 h post infection; ii) inoculated quarters 24 h post
infection; iii) noninfected quarters neighboring the
inoculated quarters 24 h post infection; and iv) quarters
of untreated healthy control animals. Samples of sets iii
and iv were generated by combining tissues of two
udder quarters from each cow in order to equalize
potential quarter specific effects. Based on somatic cell

Figure 1 Experimental setup of infection with E. coli 1303. During estrus, 10 synchronized dairy cows were infected on one quarter with E.
coli 1303 (star, i) in saline solution (shaded). One of the neighboring quarters (n) was treated with sterile saline solution (shaded). Five
synchronized healthy animals were slaughtered 24 h after onset of estrus and served as external control (c). Tissue samples were collected from
marked areas of the bovine udder.

counts there was no indication for a different behavior
of mock inoculated and untreated udder quarters of
infected cows. Therefore tissues of two quarters with
the lowest somatic cell counts were combined (see
Additional File 1) provided their cell counts did not differ by more than 10.000 per ml. Otherwise tissue from
the udder quarter with the lowest cell count was used.
Thus four samples of set iii were pooled from one mock
inoculated and one untreated udder quarter. The fifth
sample (sample ID n24h-4) was derived from tissue of a
single untreated quarter since the noninfected udder
quarters of this cow differed in somatic cells counts.
The impact of the E. coli infection on gene expression
was estimated by hierarchical clustering of the transcriptome profiles (Figure 3). The heatmap obtained with the
transcriptome profiles 6 h after inoculation showed a
uniform coloration with no separation of healthy controls and infected samples (Figure 3A). This indicated
that the gene expression of the mammary tissue was
only marginally affected in the early stage of infection.
The same comparison 24 h after infection with E. coli
resulted in a sharp separation of the infected and the
control group (Figure 3B) and a distinct blue-red coloration indicated substantial transcriptome changes. At the
same time point, the effect of E. coli on transcriptome
changes in neighboring noninfected udder quarters was
less pronounced (Figure 3C). Compared with Figure 3B,
the length of the vertical branch between the two principal groups is considerable lower, indicating a less pronounced difference of the expression profiles.
Nevertheless two almost perfectly separated groups
were obtained: three of four noninfected samples pooled

from one mock inoculated and one untreated udder
quarter (n24h-1, -2, -3) clustered together with the sample derived from a single untreated quarter (n24-4),
while the fourth pooled sample (n24h-5) was placed
into the well-separated control group.
DEG (see Additional File 2) were identified by comparison of transcriptome profiles of infected and neighboring quarters with the profiles of the control animals.
The highest number of DEG was found 24 h post infection in infected quarters (2154 at 0.01 fdr), followed by
476 (0.01 fdr) in their neighboring noninfected quarters
and only 13 (0.1 fdr) in infected quarters at 6 h after
inoculation. Despite the noisy data at 6 h after infection
6 of the DEG were also detected as differentially
expressed at 24 h in infected quarters and 2 in neighboring quarters. At 24 h post infection, 294 DEG of the
infected udder quarters were found among the DEG of
the neighboring noninfected quarters.
This overlap indicates either the existence of a systemic
response to a local infection with E. coli or a local effect
after application of 2 ml PBS in mock inoculated and
infected udder quarters. The first reaction should take
place in all udder quarters of infected cows, the second
however should be absent in their untreated ones.
Local and systemic responses to E. coli revealed by
cluster analysis

In order to look for local and systemic responses to E.
coli infection, all DEG detected in infected quarters
(2154) and noninfected neighboring quarters (476) were
subjected to self organizing tree algorithm (SOTA) [18]
clustering (Figure 4).

of infected and neighboring noninfected (untreated or saline treated) udder quarters. The data shown are mean values and their corresponding
standard errors and do not include values from animals of the 6 h infection group.

The calculated clusters revealed distinct reactions of
the mammary gland in response to inoculation with E.
coli. The first occurred exclusively in infected quarters
(clusters 1 and 6) and comprised the local restricted
response of the infected tissue. The second reaction
took place both in infected and neighboring noninfected
udder quarters (clusters 2 and 3) and pointed to a systemic response of the mammary gland to inoculation
with E. coli in 2 ml PBS. Another type of reaction was
recorded in the clusters 4 and 5. These 78 DGE were
found induced specifically in the neighboring quarters,
whereas in the infected quarters they were repressed

(cluster 4) or unchanged (cluster 5). Their transcription
was apparently regulated in a location specific manner.
Nevertheless the different transcript levels in infected
and neighboring noninfected udder quarters indicated
that systemic signals are involved in their regulation.
The extent of apparently systemic gene regulation displayed in clusters 2 und 3 is much greater than the
overlap of DEG from infected and neighboring quarters
(294 genes). Roughly half of the 2335 genes fall into
clusters that showed expression changes in infected as
well as in neighboring quarters. This discrepancy is
caused by the fact that DEG in infected quarters

Figure 3 Hierarchical clustering of transcriptome profiles after experimental infection with E. coli. Tissues of udder quarters of five
healthy untreated cows (c24h-1 to 5) were used to generate three replicates of expression profiles as controls for three separate comparisons. A:
Replicate 1 (c124h-1 to 5) was compared to patterns of infected udder quarters 6 h after inoculation with E. coli 1303 (i6h-6 to 10). B: Replicate 2
(c224h-1 to 5) was compared to patterns of infected udder quarters 24 h after inoculation (i24h-1 to 5). C: Replicate 3 (c324h-1 to 5) was
compared to patterns of noninfected quarters of infected cows 24 h after infection (n24h-1 to 5). Samples for n24h-1, 2, 3 and 5 were pooled
from one mock inoculated and one untreated udder quarter, while n24h-4 was derived from tissue of a single untreated quarter. The degree of
similarity of their expression patterns is shown as a heatmap of the distance matrix (red: more similar, blue: less similar). The trees depict the pair
wise relations with branch lengths proportional to the degree of similarity.

generally showed higher changes in expression than
DEG in neighboring quarters. Due to the fold-change
cut-off, genes with low fold-change are not assigned to
the DEG but are nevertheless considered by SOTA clustering. Conversely, some genes differentially expressed
in infected as well as in neighboring noninfected quarters were clustered by SOTA with the genes expressed
locally in infected quarters (Figure 4, cluster 1), most
likely because of their much higher induction in infected
tissue than in tissue of neighboring quarters (e.g.
S100A9, S100A12, SAA3, SDS, CP). For interpretation,
those DEG, however, were treated as systemically reacting since the differential gene expression was regarded
superior to clustering.
Based on annotations of the DEG more detailed analyses
were performed. The genes of each cluster were analyzed
in search of regulatory elements within their promoter
region. Furthermore we identified biological processes
involved in the systemic or local response of the mammary
gland to the pathogen, which were represented by significantly more genes than expected by random sampling.
Both functional descriptions and transcription factor
binding site (TFBS) enrichment analyses showed specific
results for the members of the six clusters (Figure 4 and
Table 1). Many results were specific for either local or
systemic clusters and suggested that this dichotomy is
not random but is biologically meaningful.

Characterization of the local response 24 h after infection

Analysis of the enrichment of functional annotations
revealed that the locally up-regulated genes of cluster 1
(Figure 4) have a distinct profile of functions that is not
found among the members of the other clusters and
that is dominated very prominently by ontology terms
related to immune response and inflammation. In addition ontology terms like chemokine/cytokine signaling
and diapedesis were among the most prominent. This
correlated with our clinical findings of a sharp increase
in leukocytes solely in the milk of infected udder quarters. Many genes of this cluster were associated with
classical inflammatory events (Figure 5) and TFBS
enrichment analysis (Table 1) predicted the classical
inflammatory transcription factors NFB and STAT1 as
regulatory elements. Major genes related to fever induction, IL6 and IL1B, were still up-regulated (16-fold and
4-fold respectively) in infected udder quarters 24 h after
infection although the inner body temperature was
already declining and approached basal levels at this
time point. Furthermore, the majority of observed acute
phase genes (e.g. HP, PTX3, FTL) was assigned to cluster 1. As evidenced in Figure 5, almost all DEG of the
ontology response to infection were found locally
restricted to the infected quarters and only a few were
observed also in neighboring quarters. The highly significant enrichment of biologically meaningful terms (e.g.

Figure 4 Cluster analysis separates systemic and local response to infection. Expression levels of DEG 24 h after E. coli infection were
converted to log2 fold changes relative to the mean of untreated control animals. The four samples labeled with i24h represent i24h-1 to 4 of
infected udder quarters. c124h comprises the four samples c24h-1, 2, 4 and 5 derived from udder quarters of untreated controls. The four
samples subscripted with n24h were isolated from udder quarters neighboring to the quarters i24h-1 to 4 and the four samples labeled with
c224h are replicates of c124h. These technical replicates allow a common representation of the two separately performed analyses of i24h and
n24h. Expression values were clustered using the SOTA algorithm with Pearson’s correlation metric in the program MeV4.2. Individual probe sets
are represented as lines, red coloration indicates up-regulation upon treatment, green down-regulation. Magenta represents the per sample
average.

adjusted p-value 1e-38 for ‘immunity and defense’) is
also an important indication for the validity of the presented microarray data.
Besides the response to infection TFBS enrichment
analysis gave hints towards other processes. Among the
genes of cluster 1, ELF5 was predicted as involved transcription factor. ELF5 is related to development of
mammary epithelium [19] and milk production [20].
Characterization of the apparent systemic response 24 h
after infection

The transcriptional response in the quarters neighboring
the infected ones could in part be characterized as an
immune response. Components of the antigen processing and presenting machinery as well as some cytokines
are up-regulated. Of note are CXCL2 and CXCL14,
whose products show direct antimicrobial properties
against E. coli [21] and could probably function as a barrier against invasion of E. coli into the neighboring
udder quarters. DEG of other important immune-related
agents, as for example the CC-type of chemotactic cytokines, were restricted to the infected udder quarter. A
number of genes, like GPX3, GLRX2, GSTM1, GSS,

MT1A, MT2A and SOD2, indicate the presence of oxidative stress. Differential gene expression related to
xenobiotic stress is evident by up-regulation of ATF5,
which is responsible for the induction of the detoxifying
cytochrome CYP2B6 [22], the latter being up-regulated
only in the neighboring quarters (cluster 2).
Finally, there are signs of building up a first line of
defense, like the up-regulation of genes with antimicrobial functions (S100A8/9/12, GNLY, CXCL2, CXCL14)
or acute phase genes (SAA3) involved in recognition of
pathogens (LBP) or in the complement cascade (C6, BF,
C4BPA, IF).
NFIL3 as a candidate for signal transduction

Among the predicted transcription factors for the DEG,
NFIL3 was the most interesting candidate. Its binding
motif was enriched in the clusters of both systemically
up- and down-regulated DEG (clusters 2 and 3), in line
with its function as activator/repressor of inflammatory
and apoptotic genes. Furthermore, NFIL3 was found in
infected quarters as 3.5-fold up-regulated DEG 24 h
after infection. Interestingly, up-regulation of NFIL3
expression was found as soon as 6 h after infection. Five

of the DEG at 6 h belong to the apparently systemically
regulated genes at 24 h and only 3 of them were found
local in infected udder quarters. Interestingly at 6 h the
DEG also comprised a couple of predicted NFIL3 target
genes, and TFBS for NFIL3 were significantly enriched.
The putative target genes regulated by NFIL3 suggest a
systemic up-regulation of genes involved in cell proliferation (e.g. KLF6, FGF2) as well as apoptosis and a
down-regulation of genes related to cell adhesion and
extracellular matrix.
Analyses of mRNA expression by quantitative real-time
RT-PCR

In order to verify the results of microarray analyses, we
selected 14 genes as representatives of all SOTA-clusters
(Figure 4) and used RT-qPCR to quantify their expression in infected udder quarters and in the neighboring

saline treated or untreated quarters. The results were
referenced against the expression in udder quarters of
healthy animals. As summarized in Table 2 (Additional
File 3), the values for induction and repression of transcription obtained by microarray analyses were clearly
confirmed by quantitative PCR. In general the calculated
fold-changes were higher for qPCR. For example, the
expression of SAA3 was found to be 1825-fold induced
in infected udder quarter 24 h after inoculation with E.
coli 1303, whereas microarray hybridization detected a
52-fold induction.
In order to investigate the influence of the inoculation
solution (2 ml of physiological saline), the expression of
the selected 14 genes was determined in all sampled
udder quarters of infected animals and the values of
untreated udder quarters and mock inoculated udder
quarters were compared. As shown in Additional File 4,

MT2A differed up to one order of magnitude in infected
udder quarters 24 h hours after inoculation with E. coli
1303, whereas other genes like PIR or LBP were found
to be uniformly expressed among the different animals.

the treatment of the neighboring udder quarters with
saline did not provoke a significant difference in expression of these 14 genes.
The results of qPCR allowed an estimation of animal
specific variation of gene expression. The ΔCP values

Discussion
In this work, the transcriptome response of the bovine
mammary gland was analyzed after experimental infection with E. coli 1303. Previous observations in cattle
[10,12,23] favor the hypothesis of a systemic defense
reaction, which protects unaffected udder quarters. In
order to study this phenomenon, we investigated the
transcriptome of bovine mammary tissue after infection
with E. coli 1303 in the early stage of infection (6 h)
before onset of fever and in the late stage (24 h) after its
decline. As described for E. coli 1303 [17] infection of a
single udder quarter induced acute clinical mastitis in
all inoculated animals with comparable clinical signs
such as strong fever, leukopenia, decreased milk yield
and influx of somatic cells into the infected quarter. The
somatic cell count (SCC) in mock inoculated as well as
untreated udder quarters of the infected animals
remained unchanged at all time points.
At 6 h after infection only 13 DEG were captured
solely in infected quarters, indicating subtle effects of
either the pathogen or the inoculation solution itself on
the mammary gland at this time point. Furthermore we
did not observe enhanced expression of proinflammatory cytokines like TNF-alpha. The missing induction of
proinflammatory molecules in the early phase of infection and the unchanged SCC in mock inoculated udder
quarters up to 24 h proves that the inoculation procedure neither provoked inflammation nor an increase of
somatic cells in milk.
At 24 h after infection we observed marked changes in
gene expression in neighboring quarters. These could be
caused by a systemic response to the pathogen or a
direct effect of the mock inoculation with 2 ml of PBS.
As described by Paape et al. [24] the inoculation of even
100 ml saline solution provoked only a mild increase of
SCC. Our procedure based on the application of 2 ml
saline did not change the SCC of mock inoculated
udder quarters as shown in Figure 2A. Furthermore the
analysis of transcript levels of 14 selected genes by
qPCR did not show significant differences between
untreated and mock inoculated udder quarters (Additional File 4) and proved the existence of a systemic
reaction. A detailed look on the setup of the microarray
hybridizations (Additional File 1) reveals, that four profiles (n24h-1, 2, 3, 5) are based on pooling of samples
from a mock inoculated and an untreated udder quarter,
while the profile n24h-4 was obtained from a single
untreated quarter. Assuming that the transcriptome
changes observed in the neighboring quarters are

predominantly caused by the saline treatment, the profile n24h-4 should cluster together with the controls
c24h1-5. However, the highly similar expression profiles
of the untreated sample n24h-4 and other neighboring
samples (Figure 3C) show that the systemic effect of the
pathogen by far dominates a possible effect of the saline
treatment. The notion that 2 ml PBS has little influence
is further substantiated by the assignment of profile
n24h-5 to the cluster of the controls. Hence the saline
treatment did not markedly alter the transcriptome of
the pooled sample n24h-5 compared to the control
group. Taken together the above observations strongly
suggest that the experimental infection of an udder
quarter caused an effect on the neighboring udder quarters, which we believe to be mediated systemically.
By comparison with expression profiles of healthy animals, large numbers of DEG were identified at 24 h in
infected and a lesser number in neighboring noninfected
quarters. Cluster analysis identified at least two categories of DEG. The first was found in infected quarters
and comprised the local response of the infected udder
quarter. DEG of the second category were found in
inoculated and noninfected udder quarters of infected
animals. This presumptive systemic response was discovered by comparison of noninfected neighboring
quarters and samples of healthy animals. In contrast,
most experimental designs used in mastitis research lack
external controls and are thus not able to differentiate
between local and systemic responses to the pathogen
[12,17,25,26]. A substantial systemic transcriptome
response in noninfected neighboring quarters was proposed [27], but the experimental outline precluded
further characterization. Recently, systemic effects of

microbial induced mastitis have been found in the
bovine udder by analysis of composition and viability of
somatic cells in milk [23] and in the liver transcriptome
of intramammary LPS-challenged cows [16]. Comparison of the latter with our findings by gene set enrichment analyses resulted in a higher coincidence with the
systemic response than with the local response of
infected udder quarters (data not shown).
Cluster analyses revealed very similar expression profiles of all infected udder quarters and a pronounced
response to infection, probably due to the pathogenicity
of E. coli 1303. In contrast, the expression profiles of
noninfected udder quarters were more variable and one
was rather similar to untreated animals (n24h-5 in
Figure 3C). This observation clearly demonstrates that
animal specific factors affected the systemic reaction,
although the animals included in our study were
selected according to strict criteria regarding the udder
health.
The DEG were analyzed in the context of biological
pathways, gene ontologies and predicted transcription
factor binding sites to facilitate a better understanding
of the local and the systemic reaction. Generally we
found a clear division of biological functions between
both types of reactions (Figure 5). DEG of the local
reaction are mainly involved in immune response,
inflammation, acute phase response and chemokine/
cytokine signaling. TFBS analyses based on human
orthologs predicted the corresponding transcription factors like NFB and STAT1. As shown by Zadissa et al.
[28], the use of promoter sequences from human genes
for the inference of bovine transcriptional regulators is
appropriate. The predicted factor ELF5 probably refers

Mitterhuemer et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:138
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/138

to DEG related to the restoration of damaged epithelial
tissue, which is also supported by the enrichment of
ontology terms like blood coagulation, cell proliferation
and differentiation in cluster 1 (Figure 5). The majority
of the DEG involved in immune response was assigned
to the local reaction and only a few were also found in
neighboring noninfected quarters. In this context, a
detailed analysis of expression of chemokine genes led
to a remarkable result. Enhanced expression of CC-type
chemokine genes was exclusively assigned to the local
reaction, whereas many CXC chemokine genes were
regulated systemically. In contrast to the CC-type, CXC
chemokines are known to attract neutrophils. The
enhanced systemic expression of genes involved in
response to oxidative stress accounts for the influx of
active neutrophils in all quarters. This corresponds with
the finding, that acute microbial mastitis caused a significant increase of the percentage of neutrophils in neighboring unaffected quarters [23]. The systemic reaction
comprises biological processes like antigen processing
and presentation, protein degradation, apoptosis, autophagy and genes of cytokines. Compared with the local
reaction it includes only parts of an immune reaction
and could be considered as well balanced conditioning
process facilitating the progression of the immune
response. This is for example illustrated by the induction of genes related to apoptosis, which was described
to counteract adherence of bacteria in epithelia by exfoliation of the outermost layers [29]. The early onset of
this defense reaction is indicated by enhanced expression of NFIL3 already 6 h after infection. In the late
stage of infection, NFIL3 was predicted as regulatory
element of many DEG involved in the local as well as
the systemic reaction. Thus, the NFIL3 signal might
promote a remodeling of the epithelium in both,
infected and adjacent udder quarters. Studies in mice
suggested that Nfil3 is involved in the functional regulation of the mammary epithelium [30]. Altered epithelial
cell functions might cause the decrease in milk production observed in our study in all quarters (Figure 2D).
Furthermore the ontologies ‘lactation’ and ‘lipid metabolism’ were prominent among systemically down-regulated DEG (cluster 3). This correlates with the finding
that infection with E. coli caused reduction in milk yield
in infected as well as in noninfected neighboring udder
quarters (Figure 2D). Interestingly, at 24 h after infection we observed enhanced systemic expression of antiapoptotic genes (e.g. CFLAR, MCL1). This may be part of
a counterbalance reaction to normalize the function of
the mammary epithelium after the observed decline of
fever.
Our results favor the hypothesis that very early after
contact with E. coli signals are transmitted to the surrounding tissue and to the neighboring quarters. They

Page 10 of 16

induce a systemic reaction in all udder quarters that
apparently prevents multiplication of the pathogen in
neighboring quarters and influences the progression in
the infected quarter. It explains, why time-shifted inoculations of different udder quarters with the same (low)
pathogen titer caused influx of leukocytes only in the
udder quarter first infected [12,17]. Our hypothesis is
also in line with the phenomenon of recurrent mastitis
in different udder quarters caused by the same environmental strain of E. coli [10]. The pathogen may be
transferred from the first infected udder quarter to
neighboring quarters, but the ongoing systemic reaction
inhibits multiplication of the pathogen in the time
delayed infected quarters.
By integration of our findings into a consensus
scheme of the transcriptional response to infections [31]
we could provide a detailed picture of the processes
occurring in the bovine mammary gland 24 h after
inoculation with E. coli 1303 (Figure 6) and add a new
functional dimension by differentiating locally and systemically regulated genes. The latter group points to
altered milk composition and synthesis of protection
factors, such as antimicrobials and reactive oxygen species in the late stage of infection. The systemic reaction
could effectively prevent growth of E. coli and formation
of clinical signs in neighboring udder quarters and
could thereby moderate neutrophil influx. The significance of our results is evidenced by some recent findings with candidate gene based approaches. We found
that TLR2 was 6-fold up-regulated 24 h after infection
solely in infected quarters and accordingly TLR4 2-fold.
Enhanced expression of TLR2 and TLR4 was measured
by RT-PCR in the pathogen inoculated udder quarters
and furthermore expression of TLR2 was detected by
immunohistochemistry in mammary epithelial cells [17].
Milk of infected animals was described to contain elevated levels of the acute phase proteins haptoglobin
(HP), serum amyloid A (SAA), lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) [32] and alpha-1-antitrypsin (SERPINA1) [33]. We found HP 200-fold up-regulated
locally in infected quarters, while SAA3, LBP and SERPINA1 showed systemically increased expression in
infected (SAA3: 60-fold; LBP: 20-fold; SERPINA1: 10fold) as well as in neighboring uninfected quarters
(SAA3: 3-fold; LBP: 4-fold; SERPINA1: 3-fold). S100 calcium-binding protein A12 (S100A12) which was shown
to have a direct antimicrobial effect on E. coli [34] was
also identified in milk of cows with E. coli induced mastitis [33]. In our study S100A12 was up-regulated in the
infected (110-fold) as well as in the neighboring quarters
(4-fold). Previously high levels of interleukin 8 were
measured in milk of infected cows [35]. We found 120fold enhanced expression of IL8 in infected udder quarters 24 h after infection and no significant change in

neighboring quarters. IL8 was shown to activate and
attract neutrophils [36]. The observed enhanced expression of IL8 in infected quarters might be involved in the
dramatic influx of somatic cells observed in these quarters only (Figure 2A). The increase of SSC was described
to correlate with enhanced expression of lingual antimicrobial peptide (LAP) and its expression in epithelium
was confirmed by in situ hybridization solely in the
infected udder quarter [37]. At 24 h after infection, we
found a 20-fold induction of LAP solely in infected
quarters. These examples demonstrate the correlation of
our findings with results of previously published candidate gene based investigations of bovine mastitis.

Conclusion
In summary, this first comprehensive description of
complex systemic effects in the mammary gland after
local E. coli infection introduces a new concept to mastitis research and may yield new targets for prevention

and therapy of mastitis. Moreover, the observed variation in the systemic response between individual animals
could be the basis for selective breeding towards resistance against E. coli induced mastitis.

Methods
Animals

This study included 15 healthy German Holstein Frisian
heifers in mid lactation (3 to 6 months post partum).
The trials were conducted at the Clinic for Ruminants,
LMU Munich (Oberschleißheim, Germany) with the
approval of the ethics committee of the regional government of Upper Bavaria, Germany (No. 55.2-1-54-2531108-05). Only animals without previous diagnosis of
clinical or subclinical mastitis and a reported somatic
cell count <50,000/ml were included in the study. Quarter milk samples were collected and tested weekly before
the trial to ensure that they contained <50,000 somatic
cells/ml and were free of mastitis pathogens. Two

Mitterhuemer et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:138
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/138

different infection models were used in which the animals were inoculated in one quarter with E. coli and
killed after 6 h (n = 5) or 24 h (n = 5), respectively. Five
heifers served as controls, received no treatment and
were killed after 24 h.
Somatic cell count (SCC) and bacteriological examination

Three weeks before the trial the following parameters
were documented twice daily for each animal: milk
yield, somatic cell count (SCC, California Mastitis Test,
CMT) and rectal body temperature. Quarter milk samples were collected weekly for determination of the SCC
and bacteriological examination. The SCC was determined with a Fossomatic 5000® (FOSS Electric, Hillerod,
Denmark) cell counter. To check for the absence of bacteria, 15 μl quarter milk samples were plated on Columbia sheep blood agar, Gassner agar and Edwards agar
(Oxoid, Wesel, Germany). Samples were incubated for
48 h at 37°C.
Inoculum dose

Bovine mastitis isolate E. coli 1303 belongs to the major
E. coli phylogenetic group A (E. coli collection of reference strains, ECOR-A). According to a multiplex PCRbased screening for virulence-associated genes of pathogenic E. coli, this strain does not represent an extraintestinal or intestinal pathogenic E. coli isolate. Only the
genes coding for type 1 fimbriae, F17 fimbriae, antigen
43, the ferric citrate siderophore system and the EAST1
toxin could be detected. Bacteria were kept cryo-conserved (Mikrobank-System Cryobank™, Mast Diagnostika, Reinfeld, Germany) for subsequent infections.
Bacteria were plated on Columbia sheep blood agar and
incubated (37°C) for 24 h. A few colonies were transferred to a tube of brain-heart infusion broth (Oxoid,
Wesel, Germany) and incubated for 6 h (37°C); then a
100-μl sample was transferred to a tube of trypticase soy
broth (9.9 ml, Oxoid, Wesel, Germany). Serial dilutions
were made after 18 h to prepare the desired inoculum
dose of 500 cfu/2 ml 0.9% sterile, pyrogen-free saline.
The inoculum dose was plated for control and ranged
from 421-613 cfu/2 ml.
Experimental pathogen inoculation, sampling of milk,
blood, and tissue

To achieve comparable hormonal conditions, cows were
synchronized by two injections of (+)-cloprostenol (Dalmazin®, Selectavet, Weyarn, Germany) at 12-day intervals. Animals were challenged three days after the
second injection during estrus.20 IU oxytocin (VeyxPharma, Schwarzenborn, Germany) were applied intravenously and the udder was entirely milked out. Teats
were cleaned and disinfected with 70% ethanol and 500
cfu E. coli strain 1303 were administered intracisternally

Page 12 of 16

in one quarter through the teat canal. Two milliliters of
0.9% sterile pyrogen-free saline without bacteria were
inoculated into another quarter as placebo. The control
group was treated the same way but without inoculation
of an udder quarter.
The udder secretions were sampled in 12 h intervals
before regular milking. Bacteriological examination was
performed from foremilk samples, the SCC was determined in 10 ml whole milk after each udder quarter had
been milked separately with a quarter milker (WestfaliaSurge, Bönen, Germany).
Blood samples (10 ml) were taken from the jugular
vein aseptically using EDTA-vacutainers (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany) at 0, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h after
start of the trial. Finally, cows were killed 6 h or 24 h
after trial start with a penetrating captive bolt gun followed by exsanguination. Leukocyte counts in blood
samples were carried out with a Sysmex pocH100i (Sysmex, Norderstedt, Germany). Tissue samples were collected aseptically from slaughtered cows within 10 min
after killing. A piece of tissue (5 × 5 × 5 cm) was
removed from a deeper location of the udder quarter, 7
cm dorsal of the milk cistern, of which a smaller tissue
piece (1 × 1 × 0.5 cm) was transferred to a tube containing 5 ml RNAlater® (Applied Biosystems Incorporation, Foster City, USA) and served as original material
for all further analyses.
Microarray hybridization

Total RNA was isolated by disrupting small pieces of
approx. 500 mg of bovine mammary gland in 5 ml of
TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) with a tissue
homogenizer (Heidolph, Schwabach, Germany). Homogenate was processed following the TRIzol manufacturer’s protocol to yield highly pure total RNA. Purity
(A260/A280 >1.9, A260/A230 >2.2) and integrity of
RNA (28S:18S rRNA ratio ~1.5:1) was assessed by spectrophotometry (Nanodrop ND-100, NanoDrop Technologies LLC, Wilmington, DE, USA) and agarose gel
electrophoresis.
Labeled cRNA probes for array hybridization of the
24 h samples (infected udder quarters, neighboring
quarters and controls) were prepared with an Ambion
Kit (MessageAmp™ II-Biotin Enhanced Single Round
aRNA Amplification Kit). The probes for analyses of
the 6 h time point (infected udder quarters and controls) were prepared with an Affymetrix kit (GeneChip®
Expression 3’ Amplification One-Cycle Target Labeling
Kit). RNA samples from noninfected udder quarters of
the same animal were pooled when they had comparable somatic cells counts (detailed description of samples: see Additional File 1). The controls were
performed as replicates to ensure comparability of the
sets.

Mitterhuemer et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:138
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/138

10 μg of the resulting fragmented cRNA were hybridized overnight to GeneChip® Bovine Genome Arrays
(Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) processed in an
Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450 and scanned with the
Affymetrix 3000 7G scanner. Hybridizations were performed in three sets of 10 arrays each: (set 1) 5 infected
quarters 24 h after infection and 5 controls; (set 2) 5
samples from neighboring quarters 24 h after infection
(see Additional File 1) and 5 controls; (set 3) 5 challenged quarters 6 h after infection and 5 samples from
untreated controls. The statistic software R and
packages from the bioconductor [38] microarray suite
(affy, affyPLM) were used for processing the CEL files
and to identify possible outliers due to technical or
handling artifacts. The microarray data has been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus database (accession GSE15025).
Statistical analysis and bioinformatics

Microarray raw data were summarized and normalized
with the RMA method [39] and filtered for a detection
criterion (MAS5 ‘present’-calls determined by Bioconductor’s affy-package in R). DEG were identified by the
packages LIMMA [40] and SAM [41]. LIMMA was performed for the analysis of the sample sets 24 h after
infection, excluding profiles of animal 5 (samples i24h-5
and n24h-5) as a biological outlier and control animal 3
(sample c124h-3 and c224h-3) as a technical outlier. Due
to its higher sensitivity in case of noisy data SAM was
used for analysis of the 6 h time point. Cut-off criteria
were a higher than 2-fold change and a false discovery
rate of <1% for LIMMA and <10% for SAM analysis.
The expression values of set 1 and set 2 for 2335 DEG
were subjected to cluster analysis using the SOTA module of MeV4.2 [42] with the Pearson correlation as clustering metric and default values except for Winning Cell
Migration Weight (0.006). The number of clusters was
set to six, based on figure-of-merit calculations. The
members of the resulting clusters were subjected to
enrichment analyses with different online tools e.g.
pantherdb [43] and CoPub [44] for GO terms and pathways and oPOSSUM [45] for TFBS. These analyses were
based on human orthologs of the DEG as described by
Hintermair [46] and the human genome or the orthologs present on the microarray as the background.
Enriched functional annotations and pathways are represented as a heatmap of the Bonferroni-adjusted p-values
with a cut-off of 0.05. The human ortholog gene symbols of differentially expressed bovine genes are listed in

were sequenced (3100-Avant Genetic Analyzer; Applied

PCRs.

Data analysis of real-time RT-PCR

The cycle number required to achieve a definite SYBR
Green fluorescence signal (= crossing point; CP) was
calculated by the second derivative maximum method
(LightCycler software, version 1.5.0). The CP is correlated inversely with the logarithm of the initial template
concentration. The CP of the housekeeping gene SF3A1
showed no significant statistical difference in all analyzed samples. Therefore, it was used to normalize the
CP for the target genes (ΔCP). Differences between
values obtained for udder quarters of the control group
and infected or neighboring quarters were stated by the
ΔΔCP as well as the ‘mean fold changes qPCR’ [50].
The normal distribution was tested by the KolmogorowSmirnov method, followed by a Student’s t-test to confirm significant differences between groups.

neighboring to the infected quarters and were untreated (u) or mock
inoculated with 2 ml PBS. The samples labeled with c24h were taken
from two udder quarters of 5 untreated control animals. The listed CP
values represent the expression of each mRNA in relation to SF3A1.
