Mitochondrial heteroplasmy and DNA barcoding in
Hawaiian Hylaeus (Nesoprosopis) bees
(Hymenoptera: Colletidae)

Abstract
Background: The past several years have seen a flurry of papers seeking to clarify the utility and limits of DNA
barcoding, particularly in areas such as species discovery and paralogy due to nuclear pseudogenes. Heteroplasmy, the
coexistence of multiple mitochondrial haplotypes in a single organism, has been cited as a potentially serious problem
for DNA barcoding but its effect on identification accuracy has not been tested. In addition, few studies of barcoding
have tested a large group of closely-related species with a well-established morphological taxonomy. In this study we
examine both of these issues, by densely sampling the Hawaiian Hylaeus bee radiation.
Results: Individuals from 21 of the 49 a priori morphologically-defined species exhibited coding sequence
heteroplasmy at levels of 1-6% or more. All homoplasmic species were successfully identified by COI using standard
methods of analysis, but only 71% of heteroplasmic species. The success rate in identifying heteroplasmic species was
increased to 86% by treating polymorphisms as character states rather than ambiguities. Nuclear pseudogenes (numts)
were also present in four species, and were distinguishable from heteroplasmic sequences by patterns of nucleotide
and amino acid change.
Conclusions: Heteroplasmy significantly decreased the reliability of species identification. In addition, the practical
issue of dealing with large numbers of polymorphisms- and resulting increased time and labor required - makes the
development of DNA barcode databases considerably more complex than has previously been suggested. The impact
of heteroplasmy on the utility of DNA barcoding as a bulk specimen identification tool will depend upon its frequency
across populations, which remains unknown. However, DNA barcoding is still likely to remain an important
identification tool for those species that are difficult or impossible to identify through morphology, as is the case for the
ecologically important solitary bee fauna.
Background
The current extinction crisis poses dramatic threats to
global diversity [1]. Identification and cataloguing of natural fauna and flora is key to the conservation of biodiversity, but this process is currently hampered by a lack of
taxonomic resources [2]. DNA barcoding was suggested
as a rapid identification method to catalog the diversity of
life [3]. Although initial enthusiasm has been tempered
by recognition of its limits in some situations [4], barcoding has tremendous potential to produce more rapid

identification of difficult groups and highlight areas of
unrecognized diversity [5,6].
The movement to produce large-scale databases of
DNA barcodes for animal taxa has resulted in several
prominent projects [7,8]. However, attempts to strictly
evaluate the accuracy of DNA barcoding, and in particular the 5' cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) fragment typically
used [3], have been remarkably limited in the literature.
Such evaluation requires testing molecular identification
tools (the DNA barcode) against multiple individuals per
species, across a species-rich clade, with a priori clearly
defined species. In contrast, most phylogenetic and
barcoding studies utilize either a single individual per
species, or select a sample of species from across a larger
group, or both. This is especially true for highly diverse

groups of invertebrates, where morphological identification is most difficult and recently-diverged species are
likely to be present- in short, those in which barcoding is
both most likely to be useful, and where it is most likely to
encounter difficulties [9]. Most studies looking at these
groups have either dealt with attempts to separate cryptic
species [10-12]- sometimes with results that conflict
depending on the authors' interpretation [13,14]- or have
used data sets of relatively well-diverged species that
would be expected to be separated by almost any gene
[15,16]. When closely-related species have been examined, COI has sometimes failed to discriminate between
species that are separable by other means [9,17,18].
Heteroplasmy- the presence of multiple mitochondrial
DNA haplotypes in a single organism- has been cited as
one of several potential genetic problems for the use of
mtDNA for barcoding [19], but no studies have been conducted to examine its practical effects. Compared to
nuclear pseudogenes of mtDNA genes (numts), which are
more frequently studied [20,21], heteroplasmy is more
difficult to control for because multiple haplotypes presumably remain functional and lack any telltale signs in
the sequence such as stop codons or frameshift mutations. Heteroplasmy has been extensively studied in
humans due to its role in mitochondrial disease [22], and
has been documented in insects and other invertebrates.
However, aside from genetically unusual groups such as
the Mytilus bivalves [23] it has generally been poorly
studied elsewhere. Although it is often suggested to be
more common than thought [14,24], published data are
relatively rare. Most evidence of natural heteroplasmy in
arthropods has been of length polymorphism in the A-T
rich control region [25-28]; in comparison, reported
cases of sequence polymorphism in coding genes are
sparse [29,28-31]. In honeybees, paternal mtDNA is
known to persist at relatively high levels in early stages of
development [32], and paternal leakage resulting in heteroplasmy has been documented in Drosophila [33] and
cicadas [34], indicating a pathway for the origin of heteroplasmy.
This study aims to examine the issues of both heteroplasmy and taxon sampling, by densely sampling a clade
of closely-related heteroplasmic species. The Hawaiian
Hylaeus (Nesoprosopis) bee radiation consists of 60
known species, derived from a single ancestor, with subgeneric relatives in East Asia [35]. They are the only bees
native to the Hawaiian Islands, and many are of conservation significance, with 10 species possibly extinct and
another 21 threatened to some degree [36]. They are also
evolutionarily important, because they apparently
include the only kleptoparasitic species of Colletidae [35].
As a group they are among the most widespread Hawaiian insects [37], but most species are fairly specific to one
of three habitat zones: wet and mesic forest, coast and dry

forest, or dry and subalpine shrubland. All of the taxa
have already been well-characterized taxonomically in
light of morphological and mtDNA sequence data, and
no morphological justification has been found for splitting species with high intraspecific divergence [35]. Previous phylogenetic and biogeographic studies indicate
that most or all of the lineages in the group originated on
the youngest island of Hawai'i, which is under 1 million
years old [38]. Based on this dating, the rate of mtDNA
change is extremely high, approximately 15%/million
years uncorrected, but the dating is corroborated by a
very low degree of differentiation in nuclear genes [39]. In
addition, the group is characterized by widespread heteroplasmy in mitochondrial sequences, including a high
level of divergence between heteroplasmic haplotypes
within individual specimens [38].
Bees in general are a group that would benefit strongly
from DNA barcoding. Morphological separation of species is often extremely difficult without previously determined specimens on hand, requiring subjective
interpretation of variable characters such as cuticle punctation or coloration [40]. Many species are diagnosed
solely or most reliably on the basis of male genitalia or
other sex-specific characters, making association of the
sexes in similar, sympatric species impossible [35,40,41].
Cryptic species have been recognized based on correlation between DNA sequences and other differences
[42,43], although sometimes with only low degrees of
genetic divergence [18]. The global decline in pollinators
is often cited as a serious threat to both biodiversity and
human agriculture [44], and although evidence has
mounted that bees have been heavily impacted by human
activities, many gaps remain in our knowledge [45].
Partly this is due to a lack of sufficient identification and
taxonomic resources, which have been recognized as a
major impediment to bee conservation [46] and broader
ecological study [41]. Much attention has been focused
on honeybees and bumblebees, in part due to their familiarity and cultural importance, but solitary bees include
most of the diversity of bees and are more vulnerable to
threats such as habitat destruction [47,48]. If DNA
barcoding is to play a regular role in identification of
adult insects, not just unidentifiable specimens such as
juveniles or fragmentary material, then bees are likely to
be an important group it is used on.

Results
Heteroplasmy

The most striking characteristic of the Hawaiian Hylaeus
is the high proportion of heteroplasmic species. Twentyone of the 49 sampled species amplified multiple haplotypes from within individual specimens. In 18 of these
species, all individuals tested were heteroplasmic. Of the
three remaining species, heteroplasmy was limited to

Page 3 of 16

specimens from the Moloka'i population in H. angustulus, specimens from the East Maui population in H.
haleakalae, and 11 out of 13 individuals in H. unicus. In
some species, e.g. H. kukui, H. setosifrons, and some populations of H. connectens, polymorphic sites in heteroplasmic individuals accounted for 5-6% or more of the
total sequence (Fig. 1). However, previous results from
cloning [38] and the presence of widely varying chromatogram peak heights suggest that more than two haplotypes are usually present within any one heteroplasmic
individual. Consequently, the divergence between any
two haplotypes from a heteroplasmic individual is likely
to be less than the sum of all variable sites.
The pattern of base changes indicates that most cases
of polymorphism are due to heteroplasmy rather than
nuclear pseudogenes (numts; see below). Although some
sequence reads had extremely high levels of polymorphism within heteroplasmic individuals, such changes
were overwhelmingly synonymous transitions, similar to
intraspecific pairwise comparisons in non-heteroplasmic
species (these latter comparisons rely upon a priori species definitions, but we note that COI supported these
definitions- see below). This can be seen in Fig. 1, where
74% of heteroplasmic sequence polymorphism comparisons (within individuals), and 78% of homoplasmic
intraspecific, interisland sequence divergence comparisons resulted in 3 or fewer amino acid changes. Similarly,
Fig. 2 shows that the mean proportion of transversions
was roughly 0.1 for both intra-individual heteroplasmic
sequence comparisons and inter-individual comparisons
from within island populations. Interspecific comparisons had a much higher proportion of transversions (Fig.
2), presumably due to the extreme A/T bias (93.6% A/T in
third positions) overcoming the greater short-term frequency of transitions. This phenomenon has been fre-

quently observed in insect mtDNA [49]. Comparisons
between numts showed a similar pattern to that of interspecific comparisons (Fig. 2). Overall, while there was a
trend towards a higher proportion of transversions at a
given sequence divergence in numt and interspecific
comparisons, in contrast to heteroplasmic sequence
comparisons, the amount of variability in the data
obscures any potential signal (Figs. 1 and 2). Consequently, the proportion of transversions cannot be used
to unambiguously differentiate between heteroplasmic
sequences and numts.
The heteroplasmic origin of polymorphism in Hylaeus
is also supported by results from the mitochondrial
enrichment experiments. Chromatograms obtained from
mtDNA-enriched extractions of heteroplasmic species
were fully identical to those from the controls (total
DNA). The enriched samples amplified the single-copy
nuclear gene TPI very weakly or not at all, but strongly
amplified the multi-copy 28S, while the controls amplified both. This indicates that while some nuclear contamination did occur despite enrichment, it was not
sufficient for a single locus to amplify strongly. Only 12 of
the ~2,000 numt fragments reported from the honeybee
genome are over 640 bp [50]; assuming a similar distribution in Hylaeus, numt amplification would be significantly reduced or eliminated by the enrichment. Thus, if
polymorphisms were due to the presence of numts, one
would expect that at least the relative height of the chromatogram peaks would be altered in enriched samples (as
occurred in H. rugulosus, discussed below), but this was
not the case.
Numts

Specimens from four species, H. nivicola, H. paradoxicus,
H. rugulosus, and H. specularis, coamplified sequences
that appear to be numts. In H. paradoxicus and H. rugulosus, the coding sequence and numt were codominant.
The coding sequence was cleanly obtained by using the

Magnacca and Brown BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:174
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/174

primer combination LCOHym-Pat, suggesting that either
only the COI gene was transferred to the nuclear genome,
or the tRNA portion of the numt had undergone more
extensive change. The other species, H. nivicola and H.
specularis, did not amplify with these primers, but the
coding sequence was strongly dominant (the peaks of the
H. specularis Kauai numt were very weak, and the
sequence may not be reliable). Further evidence in H. rugulosus came from manipulating PCR conditions, with a
PCR annealing temperature of 45Â°C with LCO-Nancy
yielding predominantly the numt, while at 54Â°C the product was primarily the coding sequence. Finally, the
mtDNA-enriched extraction of H. rugulosus was still
polymorphic, but with the coding sequence rather than
the numt predominant, again supporting the conclusion
that the alternate sequence is a numt. This enriched sample also amplified 28S but not TPI, confirming that
mtDNA enrichment was only partially successful.
Remarkably, the numt sequences are highly conserved
relative to each other, although with a very high proportion of transversions (Fig. 2) and amino acid changes.
This low overall rate of change may be a result of the
accelerated base substitution in mtDNA relative to nDNA
that is apparently occurring within this radiation [39],
similar to the pattern seen in ctenoplectrine bee numts
[51]. None of the numts included stop codons, insertions,
or deletions, with the possible exception of H. nivicola. In
both specimens of this species in which the numt amplified, the chromatogram shows signs of a one-base insertion in the reverse sequences only. Finally, the numt
sequences form a strongly-supported cluster in all the
phylogenetic analyses (Figs. 3, 4 and 5), indicating that
the numt probably originated prior to the divergence of at
least these four species.
Low-level peaks were also observed to occur among
some (but not all) individuals of several other species,
e.g., H. difficilis and H. volatilis. Since these low-level
peaks were not strongly associated with third codon positions, they may also indicate weakly-amplifying numts.
One of the Japanese species, H. noomen, apparently
amplifies a numt to the exclusion of the mitochondrial
sequence; it is much more divergent from the other
numts or coding sequences than any are to each other,
differing from H. globula in 51 out of 218 amino acid
positions (23.4%). Despite this extreme divergence, the H.
noomen sequence also does not contain any stop codons
or indels. Since the presumptive numt of H. noomen
amplifies cleanly and exclusively, it can be used as an
identifying barcode sequence without complication [52].
Due to its extremely high divergence, it is excluded from
trees and statistical analyses, but is deposited at GenBank
and BOLD.

Species Separation and Barcoding Identification Accuracy

The aim of this study is to test whether DNA barcoding
successfully identifies previously delimited species within
a species-rich clade. Consequently, we use the rate at
which species are successfully delimited and categorised
by COI as compared to their a priori definition, which is
based primarily on morphology [35], as our measure of
success.
There was a lack of higher-level resolution in the Bayesian analysis (Fig. 3), consistent with previous phylogenetic results from other mtDNA gene regions [38] and
which is most likely due to rapid saturation of variable
bases caused by the high rate of mtDNA evolution (see
Introduction, [39]). The NJ analysis, with polymorphisms
treated as ambiguities, likewise had short branch lengths
(Fig. 4; minimum evolution score 2.16546). This is likely
to be due to the coding of polymorphisms as ambiguities.
To test this we re-ran the NJ analyses by recoding the
polymorphic sites as the expected base sequences in the
absence of polymorphism. As expected, the minimum
evolution score was larger (2.31436).
Overall, 88% (43/49) of the defined species were recovered as distinct clades on strongly-supported branches.
Bayesian posterior probability and neighbor-joining
bootstrap were both reliable measures of species delimitation, as nearly all identifiable species had all individuals
joined by 100% PP and >95% BS values (the only exception being H. sphecodoides, which had 96% BS but only
89% PP). However, heteroplasmy significantly reduced
the likelihood of recovering a priori defined species- seventy-one percent (15/21) of heteroplasmic, as opposed to
100% (28/28) of homoplasmic species were recovered
(Fisher's Exact Test, p < 0.01). The species that could not
be separated were the H. fuscipennis-pubescens-akoko
complex (which may be an example of haplotype sharing
due to ancestral polymorphism or occasional hybridisation); H. kukui, a poorly-known species where the two
Hawaii sequences had only weak support as a clade and
failed to group with the lone Maui sequence; and the H.
connectens-dimidiatus complex. All of these species are
highly heteroplasmic. In addition, three homoplasmic
multi-island species (H. anthracinus, H. specularis, and
H. volatilis) each consisted of two or more genetically distinct, highly divergent populations that separately had
strong statistical support from both PP and BS, but as a
whole were not supported as monophyletic clades. All of
these nominal taxa except the fuscipennis complex may
contain cryptic species that should be further investigated using other methods. At the same time, there was
little PP or BS support for multi-species groupings (Figs.
4 and 5), with the exception of the broader H. volatilishostilis-sphecodoides complex.
The NJ tree with polymorphisms treated as character
states (see Methods) had increased branch lengths lead-

produces synapomorphies based on polymorphisms
shared across a species or island population. The success
rate for heteroplasmic species increased to 86% (18/21),
which was not significantly different to the 100% recovery
rate for homoplasmic species (Fisher's Exact Test, p =
0.07). The separation of H. dimidiatus is particularly
notable, as it is morphologically quite different from H.
connectens but appears to be derived from within the latter; it has no fixed sequence differences from the Maui
Nui + O'ahu H. connectens, but possesses a different suite
of polymorphic sites. Although H. fuscipennis/pubescens
and H. unicus island populations also sorted based on
shared polymorphisms, these species included specimens
with lower or no polymorphism that cluster together
regardless of island origin. Thus, interpreting clusters of
sequenced individuals based on polymorphisms as character states should be done with caution and only in comparison to the standard analysis of polymorphisms as
ambiguities.
One of the distinctive features of the Hawaiian Hylaeus
is the high degree of sequence divergence between island
populations of individual species, coupled with generally
low variation within islands (Fig. 6). Many island popula-

0.25

tions were widely divergent within a species, up to over
9%, and 56% of those sampled can be unambiguously
determined (Figs. 3, 4 and 5). Hawai'i and Kaua'i, which
are relatively distant from their nearest neighbors, always
possessed populations with unique haplotypes (with the
exception of the heteroplasmic H. coniceps), while the
Â¯na'i, and
islands of Maui Nui (Maui, Moloka'i, La
Kaho'olawe) and O'ahu often shared haplotypes across
populations. Island populations predominantly sorted
into clusters with under 0.5% internal divergence, but
higher intra-island divergence, up to 3.1%, occurred in
four species (H. anthracinus, H. crabronoides, H. flavipes,
and H. specularis). As a result, there is no clear "barcoding gap" [53]- strong overlap exists among intraisland,
interisland, and interspecific pairwise distances, although
the distribution of the different levels of comparison
clearly differ (Fig. 6). Even excluding interspecific comparisons where both sequences are polymorphic due to
heteroplasmy (and distance is often highly reduced), all
three categories overlap in the region of 2.5-3.1% genetic
divergence. The group of high interisland distances in the
range of 6.5-9.5% in Fig. 6 consists entirely of comparisons among populations of H. anthracinus, a possible

species complex. However, when comparisons among
potential cryptic species in H. anthracinus, H. connectens,
H. kukui, H. specularis, and H. volatilis are considered as
interspecific there is still a large zone of overlap in interspecific and intraspecific (primarily interisland) distance
at 2.5-5.5%. Interestingly, the lowest interspecific comparisons occur among the kleptoparasitic species, a pattern seen elsewhere [41].

Discussion and Conclusions
This is the first study to look at the effectiveness of DNA
barcoding in a densely-sampled clade with heteroplasmy.
Heteroplasmic species were significantly less likely to be
identifiable by standard tree-based DNA barcoding
methods, as well as more sophisticated Bayesian methodology, suggesting that heteroplasmy may pose a problem
to DNA barcoding approaches to species recognition and
delimitation. While all homoplasmic species were successfully recovered in all analyses, only 15 or 18 of the 21
heteroplasmic species were recovered, depending upon
the method used. Treating polymorphisms as character
states in the NJ analysis was the most effective method
for recovering heteroplasmic species, but this analysis is
most appropriate with a priori defined species, since it
will inflate intraspecific branch lengths when polymorphisms are not shared by all individuals of a given species.
Consequently, it should be used with caution in studies
where DNA barcoding is being used for both species
identification and discovery. Only the three species of the
fuscipennis complex could not be reliably separated using
any method. This result suggests that the complex is
probably an example of recent divergence with ancestral
polymorphism, and the species are likely to be very difficult to differentiate through fixed differences in any mitochondrial or nuclear coding gene. Hylaeus fuscipennis
and H. pubescens are among the few heteroplasmic species that can be found in relative abundance, and may be
able to serve as model taxa for future studies of mitochondrial inheritance in this radiation.
In addition, five possible cryptic species complexes are
flagged for further investigation, based on weak support
for unified clustering of island populations: H. anthracinus, H. connectens, H. kukui, H. specularis, and H. volatilis. As in previous studies of closely-related species
[17,53], the lack of a clear "barcoding gap" in this group
(Fig. 6) means that none of these potential complexes can
be conclusively determined to consist of multiple species
based on COI sequences alone. These results, like many
recent studies [6,14,54], reinforce the need for feedback
between DNA and traditional taxonomy. DNA sequences
are extremely useful to inform taxonomists regarding
characters that are not clear- in this case, slight morphological differences between island populations that fall
within the typical range of variation for Hylaeus species,

Page 9 of 16

but that may be diagnostic for "cryptic" species. At the
same time, they are often not sufficient in isolation, and
additional corroboration by other data (nuclear DNA,
morphology, ecology, etc.) is needed.
In addition to the problems in species identification,
our analyses also expose other problems that heteroplasmy creates for DNA barcoding as an identification
tool. First, unambiguous differentiation between heteroplasmic mtDNA sequences and the numts present here is
not possible using direct sequencing. Nor would they be
distinguishable through cloning- none of the sequences
contained the telltale signs of stop codons, insertions, or
deletions (with the possible exception of the presumptive
H. nivicola numt, noted above). There is a continuum of
both sequence and amino acid divergence between definite heteroplasmy (e.g., H. fuscipennis) and definite
numts (e.g., H. rugulosus), and due to the high rate of
change in mtDNA relative to nuclear DNA, even unusual
amino acid changes are not reliable markers- e.g., the
coding sequence of H. paradoxicus contains more unique
differences than does the numt. The clearest evidence for
the nuclear origin of the numts in Hylaeus comes from 1)
the fact that they are most closely related to each other
rather than the coding sequence with which they coamplify; 2) a higher proportion of nonsynonymous
changes (albeit non-significantly so) compared to coding
sequences; and 3) the pattern of divergence from each
other since transfer to the nuclear genome, particularly a
high proportion of non-A/T transversions. However, it
would not be possible to distinguish a newly-derived
numt that remains close to its coding sequence by using
these methods. Indeed, it is entirely possible that some
polymorphic species with multiple amino acid changes
may be amplifying both heteroplasmic haplotypes and
numts.
Second, the fact that a much greater proportion of species were found to be heteroplasmic here than in the previous study- 21 vs. 10 [38]- highlights some of the
practical difficulties inherent in barcoding heteroplasmic
species. On the biological side, the earlier work primarily
used DNA extracted from the abdomen (reproductive
organs and/or gut), whereas new extractions prepared for
this study used DNA extracted from muscles in the legs.
In humans, skeletal muscle is known to consistently accumulate higher levels of some pathogenic mutants than
more rapidly-dividing tissues [55]. Although the process
is not fully understood, a similar pattern has been found
in some Hylaeus species, where sequences from muscles
were highly polymorphic and those from abdominal tissues much less so, and sometimes nearly clean [56].
Little has been made of how technological issues affect
interpretation of DNA sequences, but they are significant
when dealing with heteroplasmic individuals. All chromatograms produced by the dye-terminator sequencing

Magnacca and Brown BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:174
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/174

method have a certain amount of "background noise,"
small spurious peaks that do not represent true bases.
The earlier sequences were done on an ABI 377
sequencer with a plate gel, which had a relatively high
level of background noise. As a result, sequences where
all secondary peaks were low were considered to be
homoplasmic. When sequencing was done with autoradiographs, assessing unequal polymorphism was even
more problematic. In contrast, the newer capillary
machines with which the current sequences were produced have a much lower noise level, with the result that
heteroplasmy is recognizable even when the non-dominant peak is relatively low. Nevertheless, there is still a
great deal of subjectivity in manual editing of chromatograms, and it is here that heteroplasmy poses the greatest
difficulty for DNA barcoding. Unlike nuclear DNA,
where alleles are present in more or less equal proportions, mtDNA haplotypes may be present in any ratio,
and as a result the height of secondary peaks can vary
from virtually absent to fully co-dominant. The situation
is further complicated by the possibility of large numbers
of haplotypes in a single individual, so that polymorphic
sites may vary widely among themselves in secondary
peak height.
Although these issues in themselves do not appear to be
the cause of the species identification problems in Hawaiian Hylaeus, they may potentially undermine some of the
rationale for broad application of DNA barcoding. First,
analysis of heteroplasmic sequences requires much more
time both in editing the chromatograms themselves,
because a decision must be made on each potentially
polymorphic base, and in training the editors, who must
be experienced enough to recognize good peaks. Second,
even with highly trained editors, it is likely that two people may not call a given sequence exactly identically due
to the continuum of secondary peak heights, from
codominance through to the level of background noise.
Future sequencing technologies may ameliorate some of
these problems, or at least allow for simpler quantification of haplotype abundance [57]. Nevertheless, it is
important to recognize the limitations inherent in any
protocol, and too often this has not been done with
regard to DNA barcoding. In a sense, it could be said that
barcoding in this situation is more similar to traditional
morphological identification- with each specimen evaluated separately, and requiring individual attention from a
person with specialized training- than to the original concept of barcoding as the mass processing of thousands of
samples by technicians with a relatively low level of
expertise [58,59].
Though there is no way to eliminate the difficulties outlined above, they can be mitigated to some degree, particularly when constructing a reference barcode library.
Most important is to include multiple sequences from

Page 10 of 16

each species or genetically distinct population in order to
cover as much genetic diversity as possible, including
possible heteroplasmy, within them. It has already been
demonstrated that increased within-species sampling
reduces species determination error [60]. It is also important to utilize extractions from different tissue types, in
order to account for possible haplotype segregation
[56,61]. At present, this is rarely done, and the tissue
source for barcoding studies is often not specified [62,63].
Performing a tree reconstruction analysis using polymorphisms as character states may help separate species that
possess a consistent suite of haplotypes, and therefore a
set of shared polymorphisms. We have shown that this
method increases identification reliability of highly heteroplasmic species; however, it comes with the caveat
that it also exaggerates within-species branch lengths due
to differences in detectable polymorphism. As a result, it
should always be used together with a standard analysis
(with polymorphisms treated as ambiguities).
This work highlights several important areas for future
study. First is the need to look broadly at the extent of
heteroplasmy. Although relatively infrequently reported,
it is known to occur in many groups [24,26,29,30,64]. Furthermore, recent studies suggest that some examples of
polymorphism initially presumed to be numts may in fact
be heteroplasmy [14,65]. The paucity of published papers
on heteroplasmy compared to the massive amount of
mtDNA sequence data implies that it is not pervasive in
animals, but it may be more common in certain groups
than others. It is noteworthy, for example, that three of
the groups in which apparently persistent coding
sequence heteroplasmy is documented in wild taxaHawaiian Hylaeus, Indonesian Chitaura grasshoppers
[29], and Mauritian Drosophila [66]- are island endemic
species, where adaptive radiation and/or low population
sizes may result in increased rates of change [39]. Lice
(Phthiraptera), which also have high mutation rates in
mtDNA [67] and are known to be be highly heteroplasmic in at least one species [19], are another candidate
group for broader study.
Second, our results contrast with those of a recent
study that targeted the "barcode sequence" for species
discrimination in closely-related bees [18]. In that study
[18], COI failed to reliably distinguish between three
semi-cryptic species of Colletes, which exhibited very low
levels of divergence from each other as well as related
species, while the nuclear gene EF-1Î± did contain fixed
differences that separated them (albeit still very few).
These results suggested that DNA barcoding based on
the COI gene might fail in this ecologically important and
species rich group. In contrast, our Hylaeus data suggest
that DNA barcoding based on COI can be highly efficient
within the same family of bees (Colletidae), due to dramatically different rates of genetic change. This highlights

Magnacca and Brown BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:174
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/174

the difficulty in applying the results of any one study
across a broad taxonomic group. These results have
important implications for the upcoming Bee-BOL project (see http://www.bee-bol.org), which aims to generate
barcodes for all bee species. In looking at these two cases
and the future for barcoding in bees, it is important to
keep the ultimate goal in perspective. Inevitably, with any
single marker, or even a combination of several [68], there
will be some species or groups for which it simply does
not work, and this has been recognized from the beginning of the DNA barcoding concept [3]. Nevertheless, if a
high proportion of bee species can be reliably and relatively rapidly identified by DNA sequences, this would be
a substantial improvement over the current situation,
where identification relies heavily on variable, subjective,
and/or fragile characters such as setation, coloration,
cuticle sculpture, and male genitalia [35,40]. While
Hylaeus and Colletes may represent extremes of high and
low divergence, additional corroboration from denselysampled phylogenetic and cryptic-species studies [42,6971] indicates that the general trend among bees is closer
to Hylaeus. The success rate in barcoding of a regional
continental bee fauna [41] also suggests that relatively few
taxa will exhibit low interspecific divergence.
Finally, there is a great deal still to be learned about the
evolution of Hylaeus in Hawaii. The origin and maintenance of heteroplasmy in the group, and how it relates to
its rapid speciation, is an important question for genetics
broadly. The fact that heteroplasmy is almost entirely
confined to the "wood-nesting clade" [38]- and that it is
now known to occur to a greater or lesser degree in 20 of
the 27 species examined in that subgroup- suggests a historical basis for the phenomenon. More immediately, the
five species identified above as being potentially comprised of multiple cryptic taxa should be further examined. Hylaeus anthracinus is of particularly urgent
concern, as it is restricted to threatened coastal habitats
[36], and the status of the Maui population is unknown.
Hylaeus volatilis is abundant on East Maui, but the divergent West Maui population is restricted to a single known
Â¯na'i, and O'ahu, which
site; populations on Moloka'i, La
were likely to be equally distinctive, have not been collected in over 70 years and may have been extirpated.
Two others, H. kukui and H. specularis, appear to be
exceptionally rare despite an abundance of their habitat.
All exhibit some variation between island populations in
characters such as coloration, but not greater than that
seen within homosequential populations of other species,
and no structural differences have yet been found. Unfortunately, one of the limitations in working with the
Hawaiian Hylaeus is that many of the heteroplasmic species that it would be most productive to study more
intensively (e.g. H. kukui, H. muranus, H. setosifrons) are
also extremely rare, and few individuals are available. Per-

Page 11 of 16

haps this is not a coincidence, and it is worth investigating whether carrying multiple haplotypes, some of them
possibly subtly deleterious [72], may contribute to the
competitive disadvantage that Hylaeus and other island
endemics appear to have relative to alien invasive species.
We hope that this study will further the conservation of
Hylaeus in Hawai'i and bees in general.

Methods
Taxon Sampling

Forty-nine of the 60 Hawaiian species of Hylaeus were
included in the study, along with three Japanese species of
subgenus Nesoprosopis (Table 1; see Additional File 1 for
details). Species were delimited a priori using current
taxonomy, where morphological differences between
species have been shown to match mtDNA sequence
divergence [35]. One of the missing species, H. perkinsianus, is known to be extant but is endemic to the remote
island of Nihoa and no specimens were available; the
remaining 10 have not been collected in over 70 years and
several are likely to be extinct. In order to account for
possible cryptic species, at least one sequence was
included from all island populations known to be extant,
for a total of 257 individuals from 84 populations. Up to
five individuals per island population, from multiple locations if possible, were sequenced to examine intraspecific
and intrapopulational variability. However, due to rarity
many species and populations are represented by smaller
numbers. The term "interisland" will be used to refer to
comparisons between sequences of the same species
from different island populations.
DNA Extraction

Total DNA was extracted using the phenol-chloroformisoamyl alcohol method [73] as described by Magnacca
and Danforth [38], or using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue
extraction kit (Qiagen Inc.), following the manufacturer's
protocol. In general, DNA taken from specimens
extracted using the former method came from the whole
body, thoracic musculature, or reproductive organs,
while those extracted with the Qiagen kit used the mid
and hind right legs (see Additional File 1 for details). In
order to account for the possibility of nonrandom haplotype segregation [56], at least one extraction each from
muscles and abdominal tissue (primarily reproductive
organs with some gut) was used for all species represented by more than one individual. Both muscle and
abdominal tissue was extracted by both methods for
some species, and no effect of the extraction method was
seen in sequencing results even in heteroplasmic species
exhibiting segregation.
Mitochondrial enrichment, using the method of Saito
et al. [74], was performed on specimens of four heteroplasmic species, H. coniceps, H. connectens, H. fuscipen-

numt, H. rugulosus. Thoracic muscle (~1-2 mg) was
homogenized with a plastic pestle in 1 ml of buffer containing 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm EDTA, and 30 mm Tris
(pH 7.6) and centrifuged at 1000 g for 5 min at 4Â°. The
supernatant was retained and centrifugation repeated 1-3
times. The final supernatant was centrifuged at 12,000 g
for 10 min at 4Â° to pellet mitochondria, the supernatant
discarded, and the pellet extracted using the Qiagen kit as
above. DNA was also extracted from the pellet from the
first centrifugation, containing the nuclei and unbroken
cells, as a control. Since this fraction still contains large
quantities of mtDNA in the unbroken cells, it is not
expected to be nuclear-enriched relative to standard
extractions.
PCR and Sequencing

Primer sequences are listed in Table 2. The "standard"
barcoding fragment of cytochrome oxidase I was amplified using a version of the commonly-used primer LCO
[75], modified for use in Hymenoptera, with a shortened
version of "Nancy" [76] as the reverse (due to an ordering
error, the last 3 bases of the latter were accidentally left
off, but this version worked better than the longer
sequence). These would be called C1-J-1514 and C1-N2194 under the Simon et al. [76] naming scheme. Nancy
partially overlaps with primer HCO, often used in combination with LCO, but also gives a slight overlap with
sequences generated with the primer pair Jerry-Pat [38].
The combination of LCOHym-Nancy also gave slightly
better yields than LCOHym-HCO in Hylaeus. PCR was
run using standard Taq (Invitrogen Corp.) with the following program: a starting denaturation at 94Â° for 180
seconds, followed by 35 cycles of 94Â° for 30 s, 48Â° for 45 s,
and 72Â° for 60 s, concluding with a final extension at 72Â°
for 240 s. One species, H. mana, proved to be intractable
with this primer combination and was amplified using a
novel primer, C1-J-1580, as the forward primer. TL2-N3014 "Pat" [76] was used as the reverse for two species

that amplified numts, with an annealing temperature of
46Â° (H. paradoxicus) or 41Â° (H. rugulosus) and an extension time of 105 s. MtDNA-enriched extractions were
tested for the presence of nuclear DNA by attempting to
amplify 28S rDNA and the single-copy nuclear gene triosephosphate isomerase (TPI).
PCR products were sent for sequencing by Macrogen
(Seoul, South Korea) or sequenced in the School of Natural Sciences, Trinity College; both utilized ABI 3130xl
capillary automated sequencers (Applied Biosystems
Inc.). The PCR primers were used for sequencing. Most
were sequenced from both directions, although
sequences were of high enough quality that only one
direction was necessary. All polymorphic species were
sequenced from both directions in order to ensure correct basecalling. Since the point of this study is to evaluate the use of "barcoding" in the sense of rapid direct
sequencing for identification, no attempt was made to
obtain clean haplotype sequences of heteroplasmic individuals via cloning (see Discussion). Chromatograms
were edited using FinchTV (Geospiza Inc.). Sequences
were submitted to GenBank (accession nos. FJ411517FJ11791), and sequences, trace files, and specimen data
submitted to BOLD (http://www.barcodinglife.org, project "Hylaeus of Hawaii"). For species where nuclear
pseudogenes (numts) were known or inferred to be coamplified, three sequences were submitted: the original
polymorphic read, the coding sequence, and the
sequenced (H. rugulosus) or inferred (other species) numt
sequence (due to GenBank submission requirements,
inferred numt sequences are available only at BOLD).
Sequence Analysis

Alignment of sequences was trivial as no gaps were present. After trimming the ends, a sequence of 654 base
pairs was used for analysis (598 for H. mana). For tree
construction, a 2-partition Bayesian analysis was performed with MrBayes 3.1.2 [77]. Using three partitions
(one for each codon position) produced a slightly lower

overall -lnL but resulted in failure of parameters to converge due to the low number of changes in second positions. Models for each partition were selected using
MrModeltest 2.2 [78]; these were determined to be
GTR+I+G for codon positions 1 + 2, and GTR+G for
codon position 3. The analysis was run for 4 million generations with a burnin of 1 million. For comparison with
previous barcoding studies, trees were also generated
using the neighbor-joining pairwise distance algorithm in
PAUP* 4.0b10 [79], using uncorrected ("p") distances, and
neighbor-joining bootstrap performed with 10,000 replicates. The Kimura 2-parameter model is frequently used
without justification [11,13,63]; due to the strong A/T
bias of the sequences here it is inappropriate, since A-T
transversions occur at a far higher rate than others. In
order to take widespread heteroplasmy into account, the
matrix was analyzed two ways: under the standard
method of treating polymorphic sites as ambiguities, and
treating polymorphism codes (R, Y, etc.) as separate character states. The latter allows consistent polymorphisms
to increase branch lengths and therefore make separation
of species and populations easier. It also increases apparent intraspecific variability due to the inherent subjectivity in determining heteroplasmic polymorphism (see
Discussion). Because PAUP interprets data in this format
as non-DNA, the polymorphisms as character states
analysis was performed using the mean number of pairwise differences model. Although several characterbased, non-distance methods have been developed
[52,80], and are more philosophically sound in species
delimitation [81], they have not been shown to have significant advantages in identification accuracy where
alignment is not an issue. Tests also indicated difficulties
with handling of polymorphisms in character-based programs. We note that this second test, with polymorphism
codes being treated as character states, is more appropriate with a priori defined species.

To measure the success rate of DNA barcoding, we
used the rate at which the defined species were successfully delimited into statistically supported monophyletic
groupings. Clades were considered to have high support
if they had a Bayesian posterior probability value of over
90 and a bootstrap value of over 75. We compared the
success in recovering homoplasmic and heteroplasmic
species using a Fisher's Exact Test.
