Abstract
Introduction: Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in women. One of the genes that were found
mutated in breast cancer is casein kinase 1 epsilon (CK1ε). Because CK1ε is a crucial regulator of the Wnt signaling
cascades, we determined how these CK1ε mutations interfere with the Wnt pathway and affect the behavior of
epithelial breast cancer cell lines.
Methods: We performed in silico modeling of various mutations and analyzed the kinase activity of the CK1ε mutants
both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we used reporter and small GTPase assays to identify how mutation of CK1ε
affects different branches of the Wnt signaling pathway. Based on these results, we employed cell adhesion and cell
migration assays in MCF7 cells to demonstrate a crucial role for CK1ε in these processes.
Results: In silico modeling and in vivo data showed that autophosphorylation at Thr 44, a site adjacent to the breast
cancer point mutations in the N-terminal lobe of human CK1ε, is involved in positive regulation of the CK1ε activity.
Our data further demonstrate that, in mammalian cells, mutated forms of CK1ε failed to affect the intracellular
localization and phosphorylation of Dvl2; we were able to demonstrate that CK1ε mutants were unable to enhance
Dvl-induced TCF/LEF-mediated transcription, that CK1ε mutants acted as loss-of-function in the Wnt/β-catenin
pathway, and that CK1ε mutants activated the noncanonical Wnt/Rac-1 and NFAT pathways, similar to
pharmacological inhibitors of CK1. In line with these findings, inhibition of CK1 promoted cell migration as well as
decreased cell adhesion and E-cadherin expression in the breast cancer-derived cell line MCF7.
Conclusions: In summary, these data suggest that the mutations of CK1ε found in breast cancer can suppress Wnt/βcatenin as well as promote the Wnt/Rac-1/JNK and Wnt/NFAT pathways, thus contributing to breast cancer
development via effects on cell adhesion and migration. In terms of molecular mechanism, our data indicate that the
breast cancer point mutations in the N-terminal lobe of CK1ε, which are correlated with decreased phosphorylation
activities of mutated forms of CK1ε both in vitro and in vivo, interfere with positive autophosphorylation at Thr 44.

ing the molecular pathology of breast cancer have been
achieved in the past decade. In most cases, however, the
molecular mechanisms underlying this malignancy are
still unknown.
Sequencing of mammary carcinoma samples by Fuja
and colleagues revealed that the casein kinase 1 epsilon
(CK1ε) gene was mutated in this disease; CK1ε was found
to be mutated within its N-terminal region with approximately 15% incidence [1]. CK1ε is a Ser/Thr kinase with

many known functions and substrates. CK1ε phosphorylates several regulators of crucial processes, such as cell
proliferation, differentiation, migration, and circadian
rhythms. The key known targets of CK1ε involve p53, key
components of the circadian clock, the Wnt signaling
pathway, and cell division machinery (for a review, see
[2]). In the original sequencing study, 19 nonsynonymous
mutations were identified in the CK1ε gene in ductal carcinoma samples [1]. The identified mutations were
shown to have a significant association with the loss of
heterozygosity and decreased staining of CK1ε in the
tumor sections. Some of the mutations in CK1ε were
found repeatedly in several patients, such as L39Q
(detected five times), L49Q (detected three times), and
S101R (detected twice) [1]. These observations suggest
that these mutations may affect CK1ε function and may
be favored during the microevolution of the tumor, and
thus may contribute to tumor progression.
Importantly, nothing is known about how these mutations affect the kinase activity and signaling potential of
CK1ε and the behavior of mammary cells. In the present
study, we characterized three CK1ε mutants that were
previously identified in mammary carcinoma. We demonstrated that these CK1ε mutants had limited kinase
activity and failed to phosphorylate the physiological targets of CK1ε in vitro and in vivo. The analyzed mutations
acted as loss of function in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway
and promoted the alternative Wnt/Rac1 pathway, which
in turn decreased cell adhesion and promoted cell migration.

Materials and methods
Plasmids

ORFs of the wild-type (WT), full-length human CKIε
cDNA (residues 1 to 416), two mutants mimicking either
nonphosphorylatable Thr 44 (Thr44Ala) or constitutively
phosphorylated Thr 44 (Thr44Asp), and three mutated
versions (P3, P4, and P6) were cloned into pcDNA3. The
truncated versions of CKIεΔC (residues 1 to 315) were
cloned into pHAK-B3. Plasmids encoding mDvl2-Myc [3]
and human Dvl3-Flag [4] have been previously described.
Details and bacterial overexpression vectors are presented in Additional file 1.
Structural modeling

The three-dimensional model for CK1ε was obtained via
template-based homology modeling using the program
PHYRE [5]. The mutated sites and kinase-specific functional domains were mapped onto a three-dimensional
model of CK1ε using the program CHIMERA [6]. The
kinase-specific functional domains in CK1ε were predicted using the NCBI Conserved Domain Database [7].
Predictions of changes in protein stability upon point
mutations were conducted using CUPSTAT [8].

(Auto)Phosphorylation sites were predicted using GPS v.
2.1 [9].
Western blot analysis, immunoprecipitation, and small
GTPase activity assays

Western blot analysis, immunoprecipitation, and small
GTPase activity assays were performed as previously
described [10,11]. The antibodies used for the western
blot analysis were as follows: mouse anti-Flag (M2;
Sigma, Schnelldorf, Germany), goat anti-CK1e (sc6471;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany), mouse
anti-Myc (sc-40) and anti-actin (sc-1615-R) (both Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), anti-HA (HA.11; Nordic Biosite,
Täby, Sweden), mouse anti-Rac (05-389; Upstate,
Waltham, Massachusetts, USA), and mouse anti-Cdc42
(610928, 1:1,000; BD Biosciences, San Jose, California,
USA). The antibodies used for immunoprecipitation were
as follows: anti-CK1ε (sc-6471; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-MYC (C3965; Sigma), and anti-FLAG (F1804;
Sigma).
Immunohistochemistry

Transfected cells were grown on glass coverslips, washed
with PBS, fixed for 15 minutes in 4% paraformaldehyde,
washed with PBS, and blocked in 1.5% BSA, 0.1% Triton
X-100 in PBS for 1 hour. After overnight incubation at
4°C with the primary antibody, cells were washed with
PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, incubated for 2 hours at room
temperature with secondary antibody, washed with PBS,
0.1% Triton X-100, and counterstained with 4 μg/ml 4'',6 Diamidino - 2 - phenylindole, dihydrochloride. Phalloidin-Alexa488 (1:66; Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) was added in the last 30 minutes of incubation with
the secondary antibody. Samples were analyzed with a
FV1000 confocal microscope (Olympus). The following
antibodies were used: mouse anti-Myc (1:150) and goat
anti-CK1ε (1:100) (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
anti-goat-Cy5 (1:500; Molecular Probes), and antimouse-Alexa488 (1:1,000; Molecular Probes).
Real-time impedance measurements

AceaE-plates®96 were used for non-invasive real-time
measurements with an xCELLigence RTCA SP system
and RTCA software version 1.1 (both Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN, USA). First, a background measurement was performed using 100 μl complete
cultivation media with or without CK1 inhibitors incubated for 30 minutes in the incubator (37°C, 5% CO2).
MCF7 cells were trypsinized, quantified, and seeded
(15,000 cells/well) in an additional 100 μl cultivation
media. The impedance was then monitored continually
for a period of 20 hours. Data are presented as a cell
index. In parallel to xCELLigence measurements, cells
were seeded (15,000 cells/well) in 24-well plates, and the

effects of IC261 on cell number and cell viability were
determined after 20 hours. The cell number was measured using a Coulter Counter (Immunotech a. s., A
Beckman Coulter Company, Praque, Czech Republic).
Cell viability was determined using eosin staining.
Hanging drop assay

MCF7 cells (4 × 105 cells/ml) with or without CK1ε inhibitors were seeded in 30 μl drops on the inner side of a 10
cm plate lid. The lid of the plate was then turned upside
down and placed on top of the plate filled with 10 ml PBS.
MCF7 cells under the force of gravity aggregated at the
bottom of the hanging drop. After 24 hours, cell clusters
were photographed, collected, and resuspended by
pipetting up and down seven times, and single cells
released from the clusters were counted.
Luciferase assays

HEK293 and MCF7 cells were transfected in a 24-well
plate format with the indicated combinations of plasmids
using polyethylene-imine (HEK293) or FuGENE (MCF7).
The amounts used per well were as follows: vectors
encoding Dvl2, Dvl3, and CK1ε, 300 ng; pRLtkLuc
(Renilla Promega, Madison, WI, USA), 50 ng; and firefly
luciferase reporters, 200 ng. The following luciferase
reporters were used: pSuperTopFlash [12], p-E-cadherinLuc [13], pNFAT-Luc, and pAP1-Luc (Stratagene, La
Jolla, CA, USA). The total amount of plasmid DNA per
well was kept constant in all conditions. Twenty-four
hours post transfection, cells were harvested and processed using the Dual Luciferase kit (Promega, Madison,
WI, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. To
normalize for the efficiency of transfection, firefly
luciferase values were normalized to Renilla luciferase in
each well.
Each data point was run in duplicate, and at least three
independent experiments were performed. Datasets from
each experiment were normalized to the control, and all
individually normalized experiments were statistically
analyzed by analysis of variance and Tukey's multiple
comparison post tests (GraphPad Prism software, La
Jolla, CA, USA The graphs indicate the mean ± standard
deviations from at least three independent replicates.
Transwell assay

MCF7 cells (5 × 104 cells) were seeded into the upper
chamber of Transwell plates (Transwell 96-well plate, 5.0
μm polycarbonate membrane; Corning (Corning, MY,
USA)). The inhibitors (D4476 or IC261; Calbiochem,
Darmstadt, Germany) were added into the bottom chamber at the indicated concentrations. Identical amounts of
dimethylsulfoxide were used as a control. After 24 hours,
cells that migrated through the filter into the bottom
chamber were counted with a Coulter Counter. The num-

ber of migrating cells was normalized to control conditions and expressed as a migration index.

Results
CK1ε mutants can bind but fail to phosphorylate
Dishevelled

L39Q is the most frequently occurring mutation found in
patients with breast cancer. In these patients, this mutation occurs alone (Patient P6) or in combination with
other mutations - L39Q and S101R (Patient P3), or L39Q,
L49Q, and N78T (Patient P4) (Figure 1a). Leu 39 and Leu
49, as well as Ser 101 (occupied exclusively by Ser or Thr),
are absolutely conserved among CK1 paralogs and CK1ε
orthologs (data not shown).
One of the best defined functions of CK1ε is the Wntinduced phosphorylation of Dvl, a crucial component of
the Wnt signaling cascades [11,14-20]. In the first step,
we analyzed the capacity of individual CK1ε mutants to
phosphorylate Dvl in mammalian HEK293 cells. As
shown in Figure 1b, WT CK1ε promoted the formation of
phosphorylated and shifted (PS) Dvl2, whereas mutant
forms did not. A partial shift was observed with the P6
mutant, but the P3/P4 mutants were indistinguishable
when compared with the control-transfected sample.
Deletion of the C-terminus of CK1e, which inhibits CK1e
kinase activity when phosphorylated [20], did not affect
these results (Figure 1c). Importantly, using immunoprecipitation we were able to detect the presence of overexpressed Dvl2 or Dvl3, and both WT and mutated CK1e
kinases in one protein complex (Figure 2a and Additional
file 2), suggesting that the CK1e mutants still possess the
ability to bind Dvl.
Phosphorylation of Dvl by CK1ε leads not only to the
formation of PS-Dvl but also to changes in the intracellular distribution of Dvl [11,19]. Dvl is usually present in
dynamic multiprotein aggregates [21,22] called Dvl dots.
Based on the cellular context and activity of CK1e, which
promotes the dissolution of Dvl aggregates, Dvl is usually
present either in dots or in an even distribution (see Figure 2b for COS7 cells; see Additional file 2 for HEK293
cells). WT CK1ε strongly promoted an even localization
of Dvl2-Myc (Figure 2c, d and Additional file 2). In contrast, all of the analyzed mutants (P3, P4, and P6) promoted the formation/maintenance of Dvl dots in COS7
cells and co-localized with Dvl in these multiprotein
complexes (Figure 2c, d), similar to earlier observations
with dominant negative CK1ε or CK1 inhibitors [11,19].
All CK1ε proteins were evenly distributed in the absence
of Dvl (Figure 2c, e). These data together show that
despite the fact that CK1ε mutants bind and co-localize
with Dvl, they cannot phosphorylate Dvl or efficiently
promote its even localization.

In silico modeling of ductal carcinoma-specific CK1ε
mutations

To understand how individual mutations are spatially
related to functionally conserved regions in CK1ε, we
developed three-dimensional models for individual CK1ε
mutants. In the single-point mutant (P6), the mutated
site (Leu 39) directly adjoins conserved residues that participate in ATP binding (Figure 3a). The CK1ε mutant P3

Page 4 of 14

contains two mutations, L39Q and S101R. These mutated
sites are distant from each other not only in sequence but
also spatially (Figure 3b). While Leu 39 is located in the βstrand-rich N-terminal lobe, Ser 101 is located at the Cterminal end of helix I in the primarily helical C-terminal
subdomain. The S101R mutation is predicted to destabilize and alter local protein structure, thus affecting the
structural integrity of the four-helix bundle, which forms
the structurally conserved core of the C-terminal subdomain [23].
The last analyzed mutant, P4, contains three point
mutations: L39Q, L49Q, and N78T. Although the individually mutated sites are distant in primary sequence, when
mapped onto the three-dimensional structure of CK1ε
they cluster into a very small area with a radius <10 Å that
is located between strands four and five as well as into αhelix B of the N-terminal lobe (Figure 3c). Interestingly,
all of these mutations surround a conserved predicted
autophosphorylation site at Thr 44 in the N-terminal catalytic domain. This site is localized within a loop region
between the terminus of the fourth β-strand (only five
residues upstream from the mutation site L39Q) and αhelix B (five residues downstream from the second mutation site L49Q) (Figure 3d).
To assess kinase activities of the individual CK1ε
mutants, we attempted to heterologously express individual mutants of human CK1ε as affinity tagged recombinant proteins lacking the autoinhibitory domain in
Escherichia coli. Despite significant efforts, we were
unable to obtain soluble overexpression for all of the constructs when we expressed them with the same affinity
tag. Soluble expressions were feasible for WT, P3, P4, and
P6, however, when the recombinant proteins were tagged
to His6, to maltose binding protein, to maltose binding
protein, and to Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier (SUMO),
respectively. The individual recombinant fusion proteins
were assayed for their ability to phosphorylate Dvl in
vitro. Although the data from this in vitro phosphorylation assay were in qualitative agreement with our in vivo
data (see above), we considered these in vitro data inconclusive since the presence of multiple different tags has
made direct interpretation impossible (see Additional
files 1 and 3).
CK1ε mutants act as loss-of-function in the Wnt/β-catenin
pathway

To test the role of mutated CK1ε proteins in the canonical
Wnt pathway, we induced Wnt/β-catenin signaling via
the overexpression of several of the components of this
pathway - such as Dvl2, Dvl3, β-catenin, Wnt3a, and the
Lrp6 co-receptor - and analyzed TCF/LEF-driven transcription using the TopFlash reporter system [24]. As
shown in Figure 4, Dvl2-Myc weakly activated the TopFlash reporter in HEK293 and MCF7 cells, but the signal

Figure 2 Interaction of casein kinase 1 epsilon mutants and Dishevelled 2. Casein kinase 1 epsilon (CK1ε) mutants associate with Dvl2, co-localize
with Dvl2, and promote the punctate cytoplasmic localization of Dvl2. (a) HEK293 cell lysates transfected with either wild-type (WT) CK1ε or the P3,
P4, and P6 mutants together with Dvl2-Myc were lysed and immunoprecipitated using an anti-Myc antibody. WT CK1ε and all of the CK1ε mutants
efficiently bind the Dvl2 protein. (b) Dvl2-Myc protein localization in transfected COS7 cells was observed by confocal microscopy using an anti-Myc
antibody. Dvl2 is either found in cytoplasmic inclusions or evenly dispersed within the cytoplasm. (c) WT CK1ε co-transfected with Dvl2-Myc into COS7
cells dissolves most of the Dvl2 punctae, resulting in the predominance of evenly distributed Dvl2 protein. In contrast, the P3, P4, and P6 mutants
enhance the formation of Dvl2 clusters with a punctate appearance in the cytoplasm. A localization pattern of CK1ε was observed with an anti-CK1e
antibody. All CK1ε forms show even cytoplasmic distribution when transfected alone. (d), (e) Cells with an even or punctate distribution of Dvl2 and
CK1e were counted. For each condition, at least 150 cells were examined.

was boosted when WT CK1e was co-expressed. The
CK1e mutants P3 and P4 failed to synergize with Dvl2,
and P6 promoted Dvl2-driven TopFlash only moderately
(Figure 4a, b). Very similar results have been obtained
with Dvl3-Flag (Additional file 4).
Importantly, the effects of CK1e were Dvl dependent
because the overexpression of any form of CK1e had only
negligible effects (Additional file 4). The inhibitory
effects of the CK1e mutants were found at the level of Dvl
because the activation of TopFlash by constitutively
active (S33A)-β-catenin could not be significantly modulated by the overexpression of any CK1e (Figure 4c). Cocultivation with fibroblasts producing Wnt3a or overexpression of crucial Wnt co-receptor Lrp6 efficiently

induced TCF/LEF-dependent transcription. Co-expression of WT CK1e promoted TopFlash even further,
whereas the expression of the P3, P4, and P6 CK1e
mutants were able to reduce the Wnt3a/Lrp6-induced
signal. This effect was obvious in Wnt-3a-stimulated cells
and became statistically significant in cells overexpressing Lrp6 (Figure 4d, e). These analyses demonstrate that
the P3, P4, and P6 mutants of CK1e are dysfunctional in
the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and act upstream of βcatenin.
Our structural modeling (Figure 3) suggested that
CK1e mutations found in breast cancer may affect the
predicted autophosphorylation site at Thr 44. To test the
function of Thr 44 we generated two mutants mimicking

Figure 4 Casein kinase 1 epsilon mutants downregulate Wnt/β-catenin signaling at the level of the Dishevelled protein. HEK293 or MCF7
cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids, and after 24 hours TCF/LEF-driven transcription was measured using the SuperTopFlash dual luciferase reporter assay. (a) Dvl2 enhances TCF/LEF-dependent transcription when co-transfected with wild-type (WT) casein kinase 1 epsilon (CK1ε)
in HEK293 cells. In contrast, all CK1ε mutants are unable to promote Dvl-mediated TopFlash. (b) Similar results to those obtained for HEK293 cells have
been obtained for the breast cancer cell line MCF7. (c) β-Catenin induces the TCF/LEF transcriptional response in the cell by recruiting transcriptional
cofactors directly to the TCF/LEF complex. Neither WT CK1ε nor the CK1ε mutants could influence the high TopFlash signal caused by constitutively
active β-catenin, confirming that CK1ε and its mutants operate upstream of β-catenin (HEK293 cells). (d) The Wnt signaling pathway was induced by
seeding B1A-wnt3a cells (fibroblasts that constitutively produce the Wnt3a protein) over transfected HEK293 cells. Wnt3a induces the Wnt/β-catenin/
TCF/LEF pathway in control cells transfected with empty plasmid. The Wnt3-induced signal is enhanced by overexpression of WT CK1ε but is strongly
depleted by overexpression of the CK1ε mutants. (e) Constitutively activation of the co-receptor LRP6 in transfected HEK293 cells confirmed the regulatory function of CK1ε downstream of the Wnt-receptor complex. WT CK1ε transduces the signal from the activated receptor towards TCF/LEF-driven transcription, while mutant CK1ε proteins abolish downstream signaling. Neither WT nor mutant CK1ε are able to markedly activate the TCF/LEF
signal when Wnt stimulation is blocked by the mutant LRP6. (f) Nonphosphorylatable (T44A) and phospho-mimicking (T44D) mutants of CK1ε were

To date, whether mutations in CK1e that are associated
with breast cancer have any effect on the behavior of
breast adenocarcinoma cells is not clear. Our results
show that mutated forms of CK1e behaved identically to
CK1 inhibition in all tested assays - compare Figure 2 and

Our laboratory and others have previously shown that
CK1e can act as a switch that promotes Wnt signaling
pathways that are dependent on PS-Dvl (such as the Wnt/
β-catenin or PS-Dvl-dependent noncanonical pathways)
and blocks the Wnt/Rac1/JNK pathway [10,19]. We
hypothesized that the CK1e mutants may mimic CK1e
inhibition. To test this prediction, we tested the effects of
WT and P3 CK1e on Rac1 activation. As shown in Figure
5a, WT CK1e slightly downregulated Rac1 activity,
whereas expression of the P3 mutant or inhibition of CK1
by D4476 promoted this activity. We were not able to
detect any effects of CK1e on the activity of another small
GTPase, Cdc42 (Additional file 5), and we also failed to
detect active RhoA in HEK293 cells (data not shown).
Importantly, the CK1e mutants also promoted Dvl2Myc-induced AP1-mediated transcription, which is
downstream of the Rac1/JNK pathway (Figure 5b, c).
Similar results were obtained with Dvl3-Flag (Additional
file 4). We also tested the effects of the CK1e mutants on
the noncanonical Wnt/Ca2+ pathway. As shown in Figure
5d, WT CK1e did not affect the transcriptional activity of
NFAT, a transcription factor that is activated by calcium
waves. The activity of the NFAT reporter was promoted
by the CK1e mutants, however, suggesting that mutant
forms of CK1e can promote the Wnt/Ca2+ pathway.
In summary, our data demonstrate that mutant CK1e,
which is present in ductal carcinoma, can act as an inhibitor of the Wnt/β-catenin and an activator of the noncanonical Wnt/Rac1/JNK and Wnt/Ca2+ pathways.

either nonphosphorylatable Thr 44 by replacing Thr 44
for alanine (T44A) or constitutively phosphorylated Thr
44 by replacing Thr 44 for aspartic acid (T44D). As
shown in Figure 4f, T44D-CK1e is a more potent activator and T44A a less potent activator of TCF/LEF-driven
transcription than WT CK1e when co-expressed with
Dvl2-Myc. This finding confirms the positive functional
role of Thr 44 phosphorylation in the modulation of
CK1e activity, and explains how L39Q mutation contributes to the diminishing of CK1e activity in the Wnt/βcatenin pathway.

Figure 5 Casein kinase 1 epsilon mutants act as loss of function in
the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Casein kinase 1 epsilon (CK1ε) mutants
activate small GTPase Rac1 and the transcriptional activity of AP1 and
NFAT. (a) Lysates from HEK293 cells transfected with Rac1-Myc were
subjected to pull-down of the active GTP-Rac1 form with agarose-PAK
beads. HEK293 cells were either co-transfected with wild-type (WT) or
mutant CK1ε or treated with 100 μM D4476 inhibitor for 4 hours prior
to lysis. The P3 mutant promotes Rac1 activation, as a higher amount
of GTP-Rac1 was pulled from the lysate (as compared with WT CK1ε).
Consistently, D4476 inhibits the function of WT CK1ε and elevates the
level of GTP-Rac1 in cells. Rac1 protein was detected with an anti-Myc
antibody. Western blots were quantified by densitometry, and the
GTP-Rac1/Rac1 ratios are indicated by the numbers below the panel.

is functionally equivalent to the pharmacological inhibition of CK1e.
Taking advantage of this finding, we tested the effects
of the CK1 inhibitors D4476 and IC261 on the cell adhesion of MCF7 epithelial breast cancer cells. The MCF7
cell line retains several characteristics of differentiated
mammary epithelium, including the ability to process
estradiol via cytoplasmic estrogen receptors and the
capability of forming domes [25], and is suitable for analyzing cellular changes during tumor progression. D4476
is the most specific inhibitor of CK1 known to date
[26,27], whereas IC261 specifically inhibits the CK1δ and
CK1ε isoforms at doses <10 μM [27,28]. MCF7 cells efficiently aggregated in hanging drops and usually formed
one cell cluster per drop (Figure 6a) after overnight aggregation. Inhibition of CK1 interfered with aggregate formation and caused the MCF7 cells to become more
loosely attached to each other (Figure 6a, c). To quantify
the level of adhesion, we mechanically resuspended the
cell clusters and counted the number of single cells,
which was increased by CK1 inhibition (Figure 6b, d).
Similar results were obtained when we downregulated
the levels of CK1δ and CK1ε in MCF7 cells via siRNAmediated knockdown (Additional file 6). Next, we seeded
the MCF7 cells in the presence of 5 μM IC261 and compared the morphology of the adherent cells after 20
hours. Control cells efficiently adhered to the plastic surface, spread out, and formed cytoskeletal actin networks
that were visible as stress fibers and cytoplasmic protrusions (Figure 6e, f). In contrast, IC261-treated cells
attached only loosely to the surface and exhibited a predominantly rounded morphology with no detectable
stress fibers and protrusions (Figure 6e, f).
To quantify the intensity of cell adhesion to the cell surface, we employed direct measurements of impedance
caused by cell adhesion using the xCELLigence System
(Roche Applied Science). This technology measures
changes in the electrical conductivity produced by cells,
which attach to golden electrodes that cover the surface
of the well. The changes correspond to the area of cell
that is in direct contact with the bottom of the well. These
parameters allow for quantification of adhesion intensity
(termed cell index) given the prerequisite that cell number and cell viability are identical between samples. CK1
inhibition dramatically decreased the cell index (Figure
6g). Because 2.5 μM IC261 did not affect the cell number
(Figure 6h) or cell viability (89% vs. 87.6% for dimethylsulfoxide vs. 2.5 μM IC261), we interpreted changes in
the cell index as decreased adhesion to the dish surface.
In summary, these results suggest inhibition of CK1δ/ε
prevents the formation of cell-cell and cell-surface contacts in epithelial MCF7 cells.
The decrease in cell adhesion that was induced by CK1
inhibition and observed in different experimental setups

Page 9 of 14

(Figure 6) might be relevant to cell behavior associated
with tumor progression, such as epithelial-mesenchymal
transition or increased cell migration. This view is supported by our analysis of the E-cadherin promoter (Figure
7a). E-cadherin mediates intracellular contacts and is
commonly used as a marker of epithelial fate, whose
downregulation contributes to a shift towards mesenchymal fate [29]. Overexpression of WT CK1e in MCF7 cells
slightly increased the activity of the E-cadherin promoter.
In contrast, mutant forms of CK1e decreased reporter
activity, and the effects of the P6 mutant were statistically
significant from WT (Figure 7a). Similar results were
obtained in HEK293 cells (Additional file 7). These data
suggest that mutation of CK1e contributes to decreased
adhesion through the regulation of E-cadherin expression.
Treatment with the CK1e inhibitor IC261 decreased
the expression of endogenous E-cadherin in a dosedependent manner in MCF7 cells (Figure 7b). These
changes in cell adhesion translate into changes of the
migratory capacity of MCF7 cells in Transwell assays. As
shown in Figure 7c, the dose-dependent inhibition of
CK1δ/ε by IC261 promoted the migration of MCF7 cells.
Similar effects were obtained with 10 μM D4476, which
also increased the migration of MCF7 cells (Figure 7d).
These results demonstrate that inhibition of CK1e or
analogically mutants of CK1e can decrease cell adhesion
and promote cell migration via mechanisms involving the
activation of Wnt/Rac1 and Wnt/Ca2+ and the repression
of E-cadherin expression.

Discussion
CK1ε is a crucial regulator of both the canonical Wnt/βcatenin pathway [14,15,17] and noncanonical Wnt pathways [10,11,30-32]. Wnt ligands from both classes which either activate β-catenin or do not - activate CK1e,
which in turn phosphorylates Dvl [11,20]. Phosphorylated PS-Dvl is thought to mediate downstream signaling,
which results in the stabilization and nuclear translocation of β-catenin or in the activation of some noncanonical pathways [11,32].
Our results demonstrate that the three CK1ε mutants
analyzed in this study that were identified in samples of
breast cancer efficiently bind, but fail to phosphorylate,
Dvl and act as loss of function in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. We demonstrate that cells expressing these mutants
are biased towards Rac1/JNK and NFAT activation at the
expense of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Importantly,
phosphorylation of Dvl by CK1e was shown to be inhibitory for the noncanonical Wnt/Dvl/Rac1/JNK pathway
[10,19]. CK1e can thus act as a switch that directs signaling away from the Wnt/Rac1/JNK branch of noncanonical signaling towards the Wnt/β-catenin and PS-Dvldependent noncanonical pathways. Wnt/Ca2+, the other

branch of noncanonical Wnt signaling, was shown to be
antagonized by CK1 [33]. Our results confirm this observation and show that the CK1e mutants tested here
increase the transcriptional activity of NFAT. These
effects are not promoted by co-expression of Dvl (data
not shown), suggesting that CK1e can repress NFAT
directly. Indeed, phosphorylation by CK1e was shown to
promote the cytoplasmic localization of NFAT and
reduce its transcriptional activity in other experimental
systems [34]. Together, our results provide the first evidence that the switch function of CK1ε, which was predicted based on Xenopus and cell culture experiments, is
physiologically relevant and may contribute to cancer
progression in ductal carcinoma.
The observation that ductal carcinoma-specific
mutants of CK1ε promote the Wnt/Rac1/JNK and NFAT
pathways and, on the other hand, inhibit the Wnt/βcatenin pathway are in good agreement with some clinical observations. The expression of β-catenin in breast
cancer is usually low and was shown by several laboratories to correlate with poor prognosis [35-38]. Moreover,
β-catenin is not localized within the cell nucleus in breast
tumors [35-38], suggesting that Wnt/β-catenin signaling
is in the off state in most breast cancers. Important to
note, however, is the fact that there are also reports sup-

porting a positive role for Wnt/β-catenin signaling in
breast cancer (for a review, see [39]).
Wnt itself was first identified as an oncogene that is
activated by the insertion of the mouse mammary tumor
virus; and the mouse mammary tumor virus-Wnt-1
transgenic mouse is a well-established model for studies
of the genetic basis of breast cancer (for a review, see
[40]). Moreover, increased nuclear β-catenin levels,
which correlate with cyclin D1 levels and a poor prognosis, were found in a subset of patients [41]. In contrast to
other cancers, such as colon or skin cancer, the key components of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, such as axin, adenomatous polyposis coli, or β-catenin are mutated in only
a small portion of cases (for a review, see [39]). The levels
of Wnt pathway components, which are common to both
the canonical and noncanonical pathways, are altered
more often; Dvl1 is upregulated in 50% of ductal breast
cancer cases [42], and sFRP1 - a soluble Wnt antagonist
that can block both Wnt/β-catenin and noncanonical
pathways - is repressed in more than 80% of breast carcinomas [43]. These observations suggest that modulators
of Wnt signaling, both at the extracellular level (sFRP1)
and intracellular level (Dvl and CK1ε), will have a critical
role in the biological outcome.

CK1ε has been shown to be highly expressed in noninvading ductal carcinoma in situ [1], which is also highly
positive for β-catenin staining [36]. Based on our findings, we can speculate that the high activity of CK1ε in
ductal carcinoma in situ reduces Rac-1/JNK and NFAT
activity, keeping the cells tightly attached and blocking
tumor invasion. CK1ε function can be compromised by
somatic mutations [1], which dramatically affect CK1ε
kinase activity (present study). The functional importance of this event supports the fact that samples with
mutations in CK1ε show an increased frequency of loss of
heterozygosity at the CSNK1ε locus [1]. Lack of CK1ε
activity/expression leads to the activation of the Rac1/
JNK/AP1 and NFAT pathways, which mediates the invasion of breast cancer cells and correlates with increased
aggressiveness of the breast cancer [33,44-47]. Based on
our data and other published information, we propose
that mutation of CK1ε might be important for the transition between ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive carcinoma.
The effect of mutation or lack of CK1ε on Wnt signaling remains to be tested. In this context, it is especially
important to determine how the status of CK1ε affects
Wnt5a. Although Wnt5a is implicated in breast cancer
pathology, its functional mechanism remains unclear.
First, Wnt5a expression was shown to positively correlate
with disease-free survival [48], and Wnt5a blocks breast
cancer cell invasion [49-51]. On the other hand, Wnt5a is
frequently upregulated in breast tumors in comparison
with surrounding tissues [52] and was shown to promote
the invasion of MCF7 cells via the JNK pathway [47]. We
can speculate in cells with mutated CK1ε that Wnt5a will
predominantly signal via the Rac-1/JNK and NFAT pathways, thus promoting breast cancer cell invasion and
tumor aggressivity [44,45]. In contrast, in cells with abundant and intact CK1ε, Wnt5a principally stimulates other
noncanonical signaling pathways that involve CK1, such
as the Wnt/CK1ε/Rap1 [32] and Wnt/Yes-Cdc42-CK1α
[33] pathways, and promotes cell adhesion [33].
In summary, our data demonstrate that the CK1ε
mutants found in breast cancer act as loss of function,
suppress jWnt/β-catenin, and promote Wnt/Rac-1-mediated and NFAT-mediated pathways. Furthermore, we
show that inhibition of CK1ε reduces the intracellular
adhesion and increases the migration of breast cancer
cells. Our findings show that CK1ε has the potential to
act as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer via its negative
effects on the Wnt/Rac1/JNK and NFAT pathways. These
results demonstrate for the first time how mutations in
CK1ε affect cell behavior and may provide a general paradigm for consequences of CK1ε alteration in cancer.

Conclusions
In the present study, we functionally analyzed mutations
in CK1ε that are frequently found in breast cancer. Our
data demonstrate that breast cancer-specific mutants of
CK1ε act as loss of function in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway but activate the Wnt/Rac1/JNK and Wnt/Ca2+ pathways. Physiological consequences of these signaling
events in MCF7 breast cells include increased migratory
capacity and decreased E-cadherin expression and cell
adhesion.

methods for construction of the recombinant protein expression constructs, for recombinant protein overexpression and purification, for in vitro

siRNA-mediated knockdown of CK1ε. Notes: pOPIN vectors [54] were used
for bacterial overexpression. The GST-bPDZ construct was prepared as
described previously [55]. siRNA-mediated knockdown performed as
described previously [11].
Additional file 2 Interaction between casein kinase 1 epsilon mutants
and Dishevelled. (a) HEK293 cell lysates transfected with either WT CK1ε or
the P3, P4, and P6 mutants together with Dvl3-Flag were lysed and immunoprecipitated using an anti-Flag antibody. WT CK1ε and all of the CK1ε
mutants efficiently bind the Dvl3 protein. (b) HEK293 cells were transfected
with WT CK1ε or P3, P4 and P6 mutants together with Dvl2-Myc. Dvl2 protein localization in transfected HEK293 cells was observed by confocal
microscopy using anti-Myc antibody. Dvl2 is either found in cytoplasmic
inclusions or evenly dispersed within cytoplasm. Wt CK1ε co-transfected
with Dvl2-Myc dissolves most of Dvl2 punctae, resulting in predominance
of evenly distributed Dvl2 protein. In contrast, P3, P4 and P6 mutants are
not able to promote even localization to the extent of WT CK1ε. The graphs
indicate localization patterns (%) in 150 cells.
Additional file 3 Recombinant CK1εΔC mutants exhibit different
kinase activity. (a) His6-WT CK1εΔC phosphorylates the α and β isoforms
of its natural substrate casein (1 to 3), while the kinase activity of the
mutants maltose binding protein (MBP)-P3ΔC (L39Q, S101R) and MBP-P4ΔC
(L39Q, L49Q, N78T) is strongly reduced (4 to 9). A single mutation in SUMOP6ΔC (L39Q) results in partial kinase activity of the CK1ε enzyme (10 to 12).
(b) The bPDZ domain of Dvl is phosphorylated by individual recombinant
kinases similarly as casein. (c) The CK1ε target sequence in Dvl2, which corresponds to residues 145 to 168 of hDvl1 (ENLEPETETESVVSLRRERPRRR),
was prepared as a synthetic peptide. This sequence was phosphorylated by
His6-WT CK1εΔC and partially phosphorylated by the SUMO-P6ΔC mutant.
The MBP-P3ΔC and MBP-P4ΔC mutants were unable to phosphorylate this
peptide.

and AP1 luciferase assays with Dvl3 protein confirm results obtained with
Dvl2. Graphs indicate the mean ± standard deviation from three independent replicates. (a) Co-expression of Dvl3-Flag and WT CK1ε in HEK293
potentiates Wnt/β-catenin signaling, while CK1ε mutants have opposite
effects and downregulate TCF/LEF mediated luciferase transcription. (b) Coexpression of Dvl3-Flag and WT CK1ε in MCF7 potentiates Wnt/β-catenin
signaling, while CK1ε mutants are unable to do so, similarly to the situation
in HEK293 cells. (c) CK1ε forms without Dvl overexpression do not elevate
TCF/LEF-dependent transcription as compared with control empty plasmid. (d) Dvl3-Flag and WT CK1ε transfected in HEK293 cells decrease JNK/
AP1 signaling. In contrast, each mutant CK1ε together with Dvl3-Flag
induces transcription from AP1 luciferase reporter.
Additional file 5 Casein kinase 1 epsilon does not activate Cdc42.
HEK293 cells were either transfected with CK1e forms or treated with 100
μM D4476 inhibitor 4 hours prior to lysis. Lysates from HEK293 cells were
subjected to pull-down of active GTP-Cdc42 form with agarose-GST-WASP
beads, which specifically interact only with the activated form of Cdc42.
Amount of Cdc42 in pull-down (GTP-Cdc42) and in the original lysate
(Cdc42) were detected by Cdc42 specific antibody using western blotting.

decreases cell adhesion. MCF7 cells were transfected with either control
siRNA or mixture of siRNAs targeted against CK1δ and CK1ε, and were subjected to the hanging drop assay next day. Cells were photographed 24
hours after seeding; cell clusters with typical morphology are presented.
Knockdown of CK1δ and CK1ε decreases cell adhesion, which leads to the
formation of looser cell aggregates. The efficiency of knockdown of CK1ε
has been determined by western blotting, actin used as a loading control.

luciferase, which reflects the activity of E-cadherin promoter, was analyzed
next day. Renilla luciferase was used as an internal control. All results were
normalized to Renilla and to the control transfection. Graph shows mean ±
