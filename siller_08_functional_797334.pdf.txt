Abstract
Background: The luxS/AI-2 signaling pathway has been reported to interfere with important
physiological and pathogenic functions in a variety of bacteria. In the present study, we investigated
the functional role of the streptococcal luxS/AI-2 system in metabolism and diverse aspects of
pathogenicity including the adaptation of the organism to stress conditions using two serotypes of
Streptococcus pyogenes, M1 and M19.
Results: Exposing wild-type and isogenic luxS-deficient strains to sulfur-limited media suggested a
limited role for luxS in streptococcal activated methyl cycle metabolism. Interestingly, loss of luxS
led to an increased acid tolerance in both serotypes. Accordingly, luxS expression and AI-2
production were reduced at lower pH, thus linking the luxS/AI-2 system to stress adaptation in S.
pyogenes. luxS expression and AI-2 production also decreased when cells were grown in RPMI
medium supplemented with 10% serum, considered to be a host environment-mimicking medium.
Furthermore, interaction analysis with epithelial cells and macrophages showed a clear advantage
of the luxS-deficient mutants to be internalized and survive intracellularly in the host cells compared
to the wild-type parents. In addition, our data revealed that luxS influences the expression of two
virulence-associated factors, the fasX regulatory RNA and the virulence gene sibA (psp).
Conclusion: Here, we suggest that the group A streptococcal luxS/AI-2 system is not only
involved in the regulation of virulence factor expression but in addition low level of luxS expression
seems to provide an advantage for bacterial survival in conditions that can be encountered during
infections.

Background
Bacterial cell density-dependent signaling, also termed
"quorum sensing", is used by bacteria to collectively modulate gene expression in response to changes in the population density [1-6]. Although signaling can be achieved

through a variety of regulatory mechanisms, all systems
described to date involve the production, secretion and
detection of extracellular low-molecular-weight signaling
molecules called "autoinducers" [1,3,7,8]. Due to the specificity of their respective sensors, recognition of acylated

homoserine lactones (AHLs) (gram-negative bacteria)
and peptide autoinducers (gram-positive bacteria) is
restricted for communication within the same species.
More recently, a novel quorum sensing system involving
a furanone-like signaling molecule termed "autoinducer
2" (AI-2) was described to regulate bioluminescence in
Vibrio harveyi [9,10]. AI-2 is synthesized by the luxS gene
product, which has been identified in the genome of over
55 gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial species
[1,11,12]. Since culture supernatants of several bacterial
species had a complementary effect on luxS-deficient V.
harveyi, AI-2 has been proposed to function as a "universal" signaling molecule for interspecies communication
[1,9,10]. In addition to controlling bioluminescence,
recent studies show that the luxS/AI-2 signaling is
involved in the regulation of pathogenicity in several
organisms [5,12].
Apart from its role in quorum sensing, the enzyme LuxS is
tightly coupled to the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) utilization pathway [11-13]. SAM is an essential donor of
methyl groups for DNA, RNA and other methylation reactions. Its utilization by methyl transferases yields S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), which is toxic for the cells and is
eliminated through hydrolysis by the nucleosidase Pfs to
produce S-ribosylhomocysteine (SRH) and adenine.
Finally, LuxS cleaves SRH into homocysteine and 4,5dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione (DPD). DPD spontaneously
forms the cyclic pro-AI-2 molecule, which in V. harveyi
reacts with borate to form a stable cyclic furanosyl borate
diester [1,11,13].
Knowledge about quorum-sensing systems in the grampositive human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes is rather
limited. S. pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus, GAS) is
responsible for a broad range of diseases including mild
illnesses such as pharyngitis, impetigo and scarlet fever
and more severe invasive infections such as necrotizing
fasciitis, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome and postinfectious rheumatic fever [14,15]. In GAS, like in other
bacteria, pathogenicity is multifactorial and requires the
coordinated temporal regulation of virulence factor
expression in response to changing environmental conditions and cell population density [14,16,17]. Studies have
confirmed that expression of several GAS virulence genes
is temporal and dependent on growth phase [16-20]. Furthermore, a number of specific regulators (e.g. two-component systems and response regulators) modulate
virulence gene expression in a growth phase dependent
manner [16,21-24]. Based on similarities with previously
described peptide signaling regulons of S. pneumoniae
(com system) and S. aureus (agr system), two putative quorum-sensing systems, sil and fasBCA, have been reported
in GAS [21,25]. Although no signaling peptide could be
identified within the fasBCA locus, the putative pherom-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/188

one peptide SilCR from the sil operon was shown to regulate DNA uptake and the ability of GAS to cause invasive
infection [21,25]. In addition, the observation of a luxS
homologue in the GAS genome suggested that quorum
sensing via the luxS/AI-2 signaling could have a relevant
function in the pathogenesis of this organism [26,27].
Two recent studies report a role of luxS/AI-2 in the regulation of virulence gene expression in M3 and M6 serotypes
[26,27]. However, the role of the luxS/AI-2 in the AMCrelated metabolism and adaptation to stress conditions in
GAS remains unknown.
Here, we were interested in investigating further the function of the luxS/AI-2 system in GAS serotypes M1 and
M19. Expression of luxS in connection with production of
AI-2 like activity was analyzed. The metabolic role of luxS
in the activated methyl cycle (AMC) in GAS was examined. Wild-type and isogenic luxS-deficient strains were
compared in regard to their adaptation to diverse growth
and stress conditions as well as diverse aspects of pathogenicity including interaction with epithelial cells and
macrophages. In summary, our data suggest an important
function of the luxS/AI-2 system in survival and growth of
GAS under conditions that are relevant during infections.

Results
Construction of luxS-deficient mutants
As reported previously, GAS possesses a luxS homolog
(coding sequence: 483 bp), the predicted translational
product of which shares 36% identity with the LuxS protein from V. harveyi [26]. Analysis of the luxS coding
sequences in clinical isolates of two different serotypes,
RDN29 (M1 type) and RDN02 (M19 type), revealed
100% amino acid sequence identity. In a previous study,
a GAS strain of serotype M6 (JRS4) was shown to contain
in its genome the insertion element, IS 1239, inserted 111
bp upstream of the luxS translational start codon [26].
This insertion was assumed to have an influence on luxS
expression [26]. Further analysis of the sequence up to
300 bp upstream of the luxS coding sequence in RDN29
and RDN02 did not reveal the presence of IS 1239 (data
not shown). To analyze the function of the luxS/AI-2 system in GAS, we deleted the luxS gene in RDN29 and
RDN02, thus creating EC478 and RDN306, respectively
(Table 1).
Temporal luxS expression and production of AI-2 like
activity
First, we investigated luxS expression at the transcriptional
level. Northern blot analysis of RNA extracts from wildtype strains revealed a monocistronic luxS-specific transcript of approximately 650 bases in size (Fig. 1A). In both
strains, the luxS transcript levels were abundant from lag
to early-logarithmic phase, after which gradual decrease of
the signal intensity towards stationary phase was observed

(Fig. 1A). Primer extension analysis further identified the
transcription initiation site (+1) as a guanine located 20
nucleotides upstream of the translation start codon (ATG)
(Fig. 1B). Then, we investigated whether the growth
phase-dependent expression of luxS transcripts correlated
with production of AI-2 like activity. Analysis of conditioned media (CM) from the luxS-deficient mutants demonstrated a loss of AI-2 like activity production in a
bioluminescence reporter assay described earlier [9]. In
contrast, CM from the wild-type parental strains induced
luminescence in the AI-1 sensor defective reporter V. harveyi strain BB170 with AI-2 like activity peaking at late-logarithmic phase (Fig. 2A, B). CM prepared from the
complemented luxS-deficient strains restored luminescence production in the reporter V. harveyi strain to a level
comparable to that of wild-type CM (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, we showed that the S. pyogenes luxS gene complemented successfully the lack of AI-2 production in E. coli
DH5-α (data not shown), thus confirming that the luxS
homologue in both M1 and M19 strains is required for
production of AI-2 like activity. We then addressed the
question whether CM with AI-2 like activity has an autoregulatory effect on luxS expression in S. pyogenes. CM
from wild-type and luxS-deficient cultures grown to different phases was added to early-logarithmic wild-type cultures. No significant differences in the intensity of the luxS
transcript signal were observed by Northern blot analysis

when comparing induction with CM from both wild-type
and mutant strains and control media (data not shown).
Taken together, our data demonstrate that luxS transcription and production of AI-2 like activity are shifted out of
phase. AI-2 like activity peaked at a time point – late-logarithmic phase – when luxS transcript levels rapidly
decreased. Importantly, an auto-regulatory function of AI2 like activity containing CM on luxS expression could not
be observed in GAS.
Role of luxS in growth and metabolism
Growth rates and yields, colony and chain morphology of
wild-type and luxS-deficient strains in complex THY
medium, THY medium supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum, C-medium and CDM were similar (data
not shown). In addition, wild-type and luxS-deficient
strains did not significantly differ in their ability to form
primary adhesion to uncoated polystyrene surfaces (initial step in biofilm formation) when grown in THY or
CDM (data not shown). To investigate whether inactivation of luxS and therefore disruption of the AMC would
lead to a metabolic burden that might influence growth or
fitness, we analyzed the growth rates of wild-type and
luxS-deficient strains in sulfur-limited CDM (CDM-S1 and
CDM-S2). Although overall growth rates and yields were
significantly reduced in the restricted media compared to
those in CDM, they were similar when wild-type strains

were compared to the luxS-deficient mutants (data not
shown). These results indicate that luxS does not have an
essential AMC-related metabolic role in GAS.
Role of luxS in adaptation to host-induced stress conditions. Further, we investigated whether luxS is involved in
the adaptation of S. pyogenes to stress conditions that can
be encountered during infection. Oxidative, acid and salt
stresses, which have been shown to interfere with virulence factor expression in GAS [28-30], were studied.
Challenging wild-type and luxS-deficient strains with
hydrogen peroxide (4 mM) and high salt concentrations
(150 and 650 mM NaCl) did not induce any significant
change in survival rate (data not shown). However, exposure of bacterial cultures to acidic conditions (pH 4) for 2,
4 and 6 h revealed a profound increase in acid tolerance
in the luxS-deficient strains (Fig. 3A). Complementing the
luxS-deficient strains with luxS in trans resulted in restoration of acid sensitivity to a wild-type level (Fig. 3A, shown
only for the 6 h time point), clearly linking luxS to the
observed phenotype. Importantly, we could show that
exposing S. pyogenes cultures to low pH led to reduced
expression of luxS (Fig. 3B), thus suggesting a correlation
between reduced luxS expression and survival under
acidic conditions. Accordingly, CM from these cultures
showed reduced AI-2 like activity (Fig. 3C).
Then, we analyzed the role of the luxS/AI-2 system in
adaptation to an environment that resembles in vivo conditions by using RPMI medium (used for culturing
eukaryotic cells) and 10% serum. We observed reduced
luxS expression at the transcriptional level in wild-type
cultures grown in RPMI medium compared to cultures
grown in the nutrient rich THY medium (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, AI-2 activity in CM from wild-type cultures
grown in RPMI was reduced to a level similar to CM from
luxS-deficient cultures (Fig. 4B). During growth in RPMI,
due to the presence of buffer salts and cultivation in the
presence of CO2, no acidification occurs. Therefore, under
this growth condition, regulation of luxS expression cannot be attributed to low pH. Since low concentration of
iron in the RPMI medium could be responsible for the
observed phenotype, we supplemented RPMI medium
with iron and depleted THY medium from iron. In both
cases, no change in luxS expression could be observed
(data not shown). Our data thus indicate that under specific conditions encountered in the host (acidic conditions and in vivo-like environment), there is an advantage
for GAS to lower the expression of luxS and the production of AI-2 like activity.
Role of luxS in internalization and survival in human epithelial cells and macrophages. These results prompted us
to determine whether a lack of luxS expression gives a beneficial advantage for GAS to survive in an intracellular

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/188

environment. Interactions of wild-type and luxS-deficient
strains of both serotypes M1 and M19 with monolayers of
human pharyngeal epithelial cells were analyzed. No differences in the number of bacteria adhering to the epithelial cells (30 min, 1 h and 2 h after infection) were
observed when comparing wild-type and mutant strains
(data not shown). Using an antibiotic protection assay,
the internalization and survival rates of the luxS mutant
strains of both M1 and M19 serotypes were significantly
higher (about 5-fold) at 2 h and 5 h after the addition of
antibiotics compared to those of wild-type strains (Fig.
5A). Analyzing the number of bacteria that survived intracellularly in macrophages led to the same results. The luxS
deficient mutants showed significantly higher internalization and survival rates (about 2.5-fold) in macrophages at
0 h, 1 h and 2 h after the addition of antibiotics compared
to the wild-type parents (Fig. 5B). With both serotypes
and in both epithelial and macrophage cells, complementing the mutant strains with the luxS allele in trans
restored the intracellular survival rates to almost wild-type
levels. Since the role of luxS in the AMC-related metabolic
pathway seems limited, we analyzed the possibility of a
signalling function of the luxS/AI-2 system in GAS survival
in host cells. Antibiotic protection assays were performed
with mixed cultures of wild-type and luxS-deficient cells
(ratio 1:1) comparing with non-mixed wild-type and luxSdeficient cultures. The survival rates of the mixed culture
in both eukaryotic cell types were almost identical to
those of the wild-type strain (data not shown), thus suggesting a potential complementation effect of the luxSdeficient cells by the wild-type parent cells possibly by AI2 production and signaling. In summary, the data indicate
that lowering the expression of luxS provides GAS an
advantage to survive the harsh conditions encountered in
host cells.
Virulence gene expression in luxS mutants
We also studied whether luxS had regulatory effects on
pathogenicity functions other than those already
described (e.g. effect on cysteine protease, SLS and
hyaluronic acid production) [26,27]. Expression of a
number of genes encoding virulence factors and their regulators [16,21,28,31-36] was then studied by Northern
blot analysis throughout the entire growth phase (Table
2). A consistent decrease in the fasX (encoding the effector
molecule of the fasBCA regulatory system [21]) transcript
and a consistent enhancement of the sibA (psp) (encoding
a secreted immunoglobulin binding protein [32]) transcript were detected in the luxS-deficient RDN02 (M19)
strain compared to the wild-type parent, however not in
the M1 background (Fig. 6A, B). This finding does not
only add fasX and sibA to the list of genes being influenced
by luxS but underlines the fact that regulatory pathways
linking the luxS/AI-2 pathway to virulence-associated

gene expression can differ among different GAS strains or
serotypes.

Discussion
Among the quorum sensing systems described to date, the
luxS/AI-2 pathway has been shown to be involved in the
regulation of virulence in a number of gram-negative and
gram-positive bacteria [1,5,11,12]. In this study, we analyzed the expression of the streptococcal luxS/AI-2 system,
its possible role in the AMC metabolic pathway and its
function in adaptation to diverse host-induced stress conditions in two GAS clinical isolates of serotypes M1 and
M19.
Expression analysis of luxS indicated that the luxS transcript is monocistronic (644 bases) in GAS serotypes M1
and M19. In a previous report, which was based on
sequence analysis, the luxS transcript in GAS (M6 strain)
was predicted to be polycistronic as a distal member of the
fatty acid metabolism operon [26]. In our study, Northern
blot analysis of luxS expression did not reveal any additional transcript of higher size. Furthermore, we showed
that the monocistronic transcript is expressed in a growth
phase-dependent manner, a finding already reported for
bacterial species like Streptococcus bovis, whereas transcription of luxS in species like Salmonella typhimurium and
Vibrio fischeri has been shown to be constitutive [37-39].
Accordingly, production of AI-2 like activity occurred in a
temporal fashion in the serotypes analyzed, however,
shifted out of phase compared to luxS expression. AI-2 like
activity peaked at late-logarithmic phase when the luxS
transcript had already declined being just above the
detectable expression level. We also investigated the possibility of an auto-regulation mechanism of luxS expression in GAS. Induction experiments by Northern blot
analysis failed to show a regulation of luxS expression by
AI-2 dependent CM. These findings are in accordance with
previous work in S. typhimurium, where AI-2 production
and luxS transcription were not in phase either, also suggesting that luxS expression was not regulated by AI-2
[38].
Despite intensive research on luxS and AI-2 during the last
years, a clear separation of the possible metabolic function of AI-2 from its possible signaling activity could not
be achieved. A recent comparative genomic and phylogenetic analysis of synthesis and signal transduction pathways showed that S. pyogenes contains the two-step
enzymatic pathway catalyzed by the Pfs and LuxS
enzymes to detoxify SAH leading to AI-2 production
[13,40]. Interestingly, in S. pyogenes the AMC is incomplete as it lacks the homocysteine methyltransferases
(MetE or MetH) that convert the SAH-derived metabolic
product homocysteine to methionine. Nevertheless, S.
pyogenes encodes the SAM synthetase ortholog (MetK) that

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/188

permits conversion of methionine to SAM [40]. Therefore,
either GAS cannot recycle homocysteine to methionine
(as it has been described in Borrelia burgdorferi [41]) or
recycling occurs through other types of methyltransferases. In the former case of a de novo methionine synthesis defect, bacterial growth would exclusively depend on
sulfur provided from external sources. In our study,
decreasing media concentrations of cysteine and methionine reduced to a similar extent bacterial growth and
yields in both wild-type and luxS-deficient strains. These
data indicate that GAS, as a poly-auxotrophic organism, is
unable to recycle homocysteine to methionine. Moreover,
we showed that inactivation of luxS does not lead to a
metabolic burden that would influence growth or fitness.
Although AI-2 can certainly be considered as a metabolite,
the viability and lack of growth defects of the investigated
luxS-deficient mutants in various media including minimal media depleted of sulfur sources argues against an
essential role of luxS in AMC-related metabolism.
The previously described regulatory role of luxS in the production of virulence factors in GAS [26,27] prompted us
to investigate the role of the luxS/AI-2 system in the adaptation to host-induced stress conditions. During an ongoing infection, bacteria often have to face challenging
conditions in particular niches of the host, including
changes in pH, and therefore are forced to develop quickly
an adaptive response, which requires fine-tuning of pathogenicity gene expression. Although we could not identify
a possible involvement of the GAS luxS system in adaptation to oxidative and salt stress, we showed an increased
survival of S. pyogenes under acidic conditions when the
luxS/AI-2 system was down-regulated. This is in accordance with luxS expression and AI-2 production being significantly lowered when GAS cells were grown in low pH
conditions. Interestingly, previous studies in S. mutans
showed that acid sensitivity was enhanced in luxS deficient mutants [42,43] and that luxS expression was
increased at low pH [44,45]. These reverse effects of luxS
on tolerance to acidic conditions in S. pyogenes and S.
mutans need to be considered in regard to their different
living habitats and pathogenesis. Thus, our data reveal a
link between the S. pyogenes luxS/AI-2 system and pathways involved in adaptation of the organism to stress
[46,47]. In addition, we also observed a reduction of luxS
expression and AI-2 like activity in GAS cells grown in
serum enriched RPMI, a medium with a composition similar to that of human plasma. In a previous study,
Marouni et al. reported that in an M6 serotype, the survival of a luxS-deficient mutant in epithelial cells at 4 h
after infection was higher compared to the wild-type parent [27]. Here we analyzed further the role of luxS in interaction of S. pyogenes with host cells. No differences in
adhesion rates to human pharyngeal epithelial cells were
observed when comparing wild-type and luxS-deficient

mutants in both M1 and M19 serotypes. However, the
luxS-deficient mutants had a significant advantage to survive intracellularly in both epithelial cells (over a period
of 7 h after infection) and macrophages (over a period of
3 h after infection). Taken together, we show that low
level of luxS and AI-2 expression seems to provide a competitive advantage for GAS survival under specific conditions encountered during infection.
With luxS being linked to stress and adaptation to the
host, we were interested in investigating additional effects
of luxS on virulence factor expression in GAS. In an M6
serotype, luxS was shown to regulate streptolysin S (SLS)
expression at the transcriptional level and SpeB cysteine
protease activity [26]. In an M3 serotype, luxS was
reported to regulate expression of SpeB and M protein at
the transcriptional level and hyaluronic acid capsule at the
post-transcriptional level [27]. In our report, we show that
luxS had a positive effect on fasX expression and a negative
effect on sibA (psp) expression at the transcriptional level.
fasX is a small RNA molecule, effector of the fasBCA
operon, which has regulatory functions on virulence factor expression. fasX was also suggested to be involved in
local tissue destruction and general bacterial aggressiveness towards host cells [21,48]. sibA (psp) is a virulence
gene encoding a secreted immunoglobulin binding protein [32]. Remarkably, the above described regulatory
effects were only observed in the M19 strain, thus suggesting a strain or serotype dependent effect of luxS on the
expression of these two targets. The strain- or serotypedependent effect of luxS observed in this study emphasizes differences in regulatory pathways among different
GAS isolates. Along these lines, previous reports demonstrated that mutations in GAS regulators might alter disease progression [49,50]. This is well illustrated with the
two-component regulatory system CovRS where mutations in the sensor encoding gene covS have been shown
to correlate with human disease severity [51,52]. Mutations in this gene can occur under selective pressure
encountered in the host and can generate hypervirulent
GAS variants with increased risk of systemic dissemination [51,52]. In the case of luxS, strain specificity manifestation of virulence-associated gene regulation by luxS has
been reported previously in Neisseria meningitidis and Serratia marcescens [53,54]. Additionally, Marouni et al.
attributed the dissimilar results of the effect of luxS on
bacterial growth and the level of SpeB regulation in GAS
to a possible strain-specific effect [27]. The finding that
luxS can affect the expression of fasX RNA also provides an
additional evidence for the notion that small RNAs have
the ability to integrate cell density signals together with
other environmental stimuli to affect gene expression
[55].

Conclusion
Our data together with previous reports suggest a complex
role of the luxS/AI-2 system in S. pyogenes. Here, we
showed that expression of both luxS and AI-2 occurs in a
temporal fashion but AI-2 like activity does not seem to
have a regulatory effect on luxS expression. Analysis of the
role of luxS in metabolism demonstrated a limited role of
luxS in the AMC-related metabolism. However, studying
the possible function of the luxS/AI-2 system in adaptation to stress revealed that a down-regulation of luxS
expression provides an advantage for S. pyogenes to tolerate acidic conditions and grow in a host environmentmimicking medium. Accordingly, there was an increased
ability of the luxS-deficient mutants to survive intracellularly in both epithelial cells and macrophages. Altogether,
our data suggest an important function for the luxS/AI-2
system in survival and growth of GAS under conditions
that are relevant during infections. Based on the data outlined in this article, it is tempting to speculate that in GAS,
luxS is not exclusively a key part of a detoxification pathway but rather modulation of luxS expression levels
would allow adjusting bacterial fitness in response to
changing host conditions. Finally, our study revealed two
novel virulence-associated targets of luxS in S. pyogenes:
the regulator fasX RNA and the virulence gene sibA.

Methods
Bacterial strains and growth conditions
Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed
in Table 1. S. pyogenes was routinely cultured in Todd
Hewitt Broth (THB, Bacto, Becton Dickinson) supplemented with 0.2% yeast extract (Oxoid) (THY) without
agitation or on trypticase soy agar supplemented with 3%
sheep blood (TSA, BBL, Becton Dickinson). C-medium
(peptide rich and carbohydrate poor), THY or RPMI
medium supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum
(Gibco), metal ion-restricted medium, chemically defined
medium (CDM) and sulfur-restricted CDM (CDM-S)
were used in specific experiments [56,57]. For the eukaryotic-like environment, RPMI 1640 (PAA) was supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (Gibco) or 10%
foetal bovine serum and 50 μM FeCl3. For metal-ion
restricted medium, THY was treated overnight with 30 g of
chelating resin Chelex 100 (Sigma)/liter, supplemented
with 1 mM MgCl2 or 1 mM MgCl2and 1 mM FeCl3. Sulfurrestricted CDM (CDM-S) consisted of CDM with sulfur
containing salts replaced with their chloride equivalents
[58]. CDM contained L-methionine (670 μM), L-cysteine
(4,125 μM) and L-cystine (208 μM). In sulfur-limiting
conditions, L-cystine was eliminated and only L-cysteine
(10 μM or 350 μM) and L-methionine (1 μM or 100 μM)
were provided as sulfur source. All S. pyogenes cultures
were incubated at 37°C in an atmosphere supplemented
with 5% CO2. Escherichia coli was grown aerobically at
37°C in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium either in liquid with

shaking or on agar plates. V. harveyi was cultured aerobically at 28°C in an Autoinducer Bioassay (AB) medium
[9]. Transformation of E. coli and S. pyogenes was performed as previously described [59,60]. Whenever
required, suitable antibiotics were added to the medium
to the following final concentrations: erythromycin 300
μg/ml for E. coli and 3 μg/ml for S. pyogenes; kanamycin 25
μg/ml for E. coli and 300 μg/ml for S. pyogenes. Bacterial
cell growth was monitored periodically by measuring the
optical density of culture aliquots at 620 nm using a
microplate reader (SLT Spectra Reader).
DNA manipulations
DNA manipulations including DNA preparation, amplification, digestion, ligation, purification, agarose gel electrophoresis and Southern blot analysis were performed
according to standard techniques [60]. Synthetic oligonucleotides used as primers in this study (Table 2) were supplied by VBC-Biotech Services GmbH. Sequencing
reactions were performed at VBC-Biotech Services GmbH.
Construction of the luxS-deficient mutants
Replacement of the luxS coding sequence with a kanamycin resistance cassette, aphIII [61], was performed selecting for a double cross-over event. For this purpose, a 1209
bp fragment upstream of luxS (luxS-up) and a 1107 bp
fragment downstream of luxS (luxS-down) were amplified
using wild-type genomic DNA as template and primers
(containing flanking restriction sites) oliRN22/oliRN21
and oliRN20/oliRN19, respectively. The aphIII cassette
was amplified using plasmid pAT21 as template and
primers oliRN23/oliRN24. After digestion with the
respective restriction enzymes, the three fragments were
ligated and cloned into pUC19 (suicide vector for S. pyogenes). The resulting plasmid pEC131 was purified, linearized with the restriction enzyme ScaI (which cuts within
the ampicillin resistance cassette) and used to transform
electro-competent wild-type S. pyogenes. Kanamycin resistant clones were selected and the correct replacement event
was checked by PCR analysis using combinations of primers oliRN267 and oliRN268 derived from flanking regions
upstream and downstream of the luxS-up and luxS-down
fragments and primers oliRN69 and oliRN70 specific to
the aphIII cassette. Southern blot analysis was done to further confirm that the recombination events had not
affected the DNA regions located upstream and downstream of luxS. The S. pyogenes mutants were grown in liquid medium without antibiotic unless otherwise
specified.
Construction of plasmids for complementation studies
Plasmid pEC82 contains repDEG-pAMβ1 (the origin of
replication of pAMβ1), ermAM (an erythromycin resistance gene with its own promoter and transcriptional terminator), ColE1 (a pUC19-based ColE1 origin of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/188

replication for E. coli) and an expanded MCS (multiple
cloning site). To create the pEC83 luxS-complementation
vector, a 1152 bp large DNA fragment (PluxS-luxS-TT)
containing the luxS coding sequence, its putative promoter region and putative transcriptional terminator, was
amplified from wild-type genomic DNA using primers
(containing flanking restriction sites) oliRN205/
oliRN280 and cloned into pEC82. Plasmids pEC82 and
pEC83 were introduced in competent E. coli and S. pyogenes strains selecting for erythromycin resistant clones.
RNA analysis
Total RNA was prepared from culture samples harvested at
different time points during growth and further processed
for normalization and Northern blot analysis as previously described [62] with minor modifications. Specific
α-32P-dATP labeled DNA probes corresponding to internal fragments of genes were created by amplification of
wild-type genomic DNA using primers described in Table
2. Primer extension analysis of the luxS transcript and
DNA sequencing reactions were carried out according to
standard protocols [60].
Phenotypical studies
Assays for bioluminescence, acid killing, hydrogen peroxide killing, salt stress and biofilm formation were performed as described previously [9,28,29,43,63] with
some minor modifications. For the acid tolerance assay,
mid-logarithmic phase bacterial cultures were harvested
by centrifugation and washed once with 0.1 M glycine
buffer (pH 7.0). Culture aliquots were removed for CFU
determination and the remaining cultures were subjected
to killing by incubating the cells in 0.1 M glycine buffer
(pH 4) for 6 h. The number of viable bacteria was determined by plating appropriate dilutions in triplicate on
TSA media. For each individual experiment, the ability of
strains to survive the acid challenge was reported as survival in percent, defined by the ratio of average CFU/ml
(triplicate measurements) recovered after challenge versus
the average number of CFU/ml (triplicate measurements)
present immediately before challenge × 100.
Preparation of conditioned medium for induction assays
Conditioned medium (CM) was prepared from bacterial
cultures grown in THY buffered with 0.1 M HEPES
(Sigma) (pH 7.5) to early-, mid- and late-logarithmic
phase. Culture supernatants were separated from bacterial
pellets by centrifugation at 9,500 × g for 30 min at 4°C,
filter sterilized (0.45 μm) and stored at -20°C. For induction assays, early-logarithmic wild-type cultures were
induced for 60 and 90 min with THY adjusted to pH 7.5,
6.0 and 5.0 or with CM of wild-type and luxS-deficient
cultures from early-, mid- and late-logarithmic growth
phase and then subjected to Northern blot analysis.

264.7 macrophages in an antibiotic protection assay. For this, bacterial cultures were grown to mid-logarithmic (RAW 264.7)
and late-logarithmic (HEp-2) phases, growth time points showing optimal internalization rates in RAW 264.7 and HEp-2,
respectively. The percent intracellular invasion represents the average CFU/ml number of viable intracellular bacteria recovered at different times following addition of antibiotics versus the average CFU/ml number of inoculated bacteria × 100. The
average values and standard deviations of three independent assays are shown. The asterisks indicate that the differences in
survival rates between the luxS-deficient mutants and the wild-type strains were statistically significant (P < 0.01 for Hep-2 epithelial cells, P < 0.05 for RAW 264.7 macrophages). Similar data were obtained for both M1 and M19 serotypes.

Bacterial adhesion, internalization and survival assays in
host cells. HEp-2 cells and RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages were maintained in RPMI medium (HEp-2 cells)
or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (D-MEM, Gibco)
(RAW 264.7 cells) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine
serum (Gibco), penicillin (100 μg/ml) and streptomycin
(100 μg/ml), and grown at 37°C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Prior the infection assay, the cells were
cultured overnight to semi-confluency (1.5 × 105 cells per
well for HEp-2 cells and 2 × 105 cells per well for
RAW264.7 cells) in 24-well tissue culture plates containing medium without antibiotic. GAS strains were grown
to the same OD620 nm corresponding to mid-logarithmic
(RAW 264.7) or late-logarithmic (HEp-2) phase, washed
with PBS, suspended in fresh cell culture medium and
added to the semi-confluent host cell monolayers at a
multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5:1 (HEp-2) or 100:1
(RAW 264.7) in triplicate. Times of incubation were 30
min, 1 h and 2 h (adhesion, HEp-2 cells), 2 h (internalization, HEp-2 cells) and 30 min (RAW 264.7 cells). For
adhesion assays (HEp-2 cells), infected monolayers were
washed extensively with PBS before lysing. For internalization assays (RAW 264.7 cells), extracellularly adhered
bacteria were killed by incubation with fresh medium
containing either 100 μg/ml gentamicin and 5 μg/ml penicillin (HEp-2 cells) or 60 μg/ml penicillin (RAW 264.7
cells). At indicated time points, the infected monolayers

were washed extensively with PBS to remove the antibiotics. Cells were then lysed with chilled sterile distilled
water. The number of viable intracellular bacteria released
from the lysed cells was determined by plating appropriate dilutions of the lysates on TSA-blood plates in triplicates followed by 24 h incubation at 37°C. The number of
bacteria that survived intracellularly was calculated using
the following equation: average number of bacteria recovered (cfu/ml) per well (triplicate) at designated time
point/inoculated number of bacteria (cfu/ml)) × 100.
Average values were plotted.
