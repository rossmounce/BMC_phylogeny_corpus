The IGF1 small dog haplotype is derived from
Middle Eastern grey wolves
Melissa M Gray1,2*, Nathan B Sutter3, Elaine A Ostrander4, Robert K Wayne1

Abstract
Background: A selective sweep containing the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) gene is associated with size
variation in domestic dogs. Intron 2 of IGF1 contains a SINE element and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
found in all small dog breeds that is almost entirely absent from large breeds. In this study, we surveyed a large
sample of grey wolf populations to better understand the ancestral pattern of variation at IGF1 with a particular
focus on the distribution of the small dog haplotype and its relationship to the origin of the dog.
Results: We present DNA sequence data that confirms the absence of the derived small SNP allele in the intron 2
region of IGF1 in a large sample of grey wolves and further establishes the absence of a small dog associated SINE
element in all wild canids and most large dog breeds. Grey wolf haplotypes from the Middle East have higher
nucleotide diversity suggesting an origin there. Additionally, PCA and phylogenetic analyses suggests a closer
kinship of the small domestic dog IGF1 haplotype with those from Middle Eastern grey wolves.
Conclusions: The absence of both the SINE element and SNP allele in grey wolves suggests that the mutation for
small body size post-dates the domestication of dogs. However, because all small dogs possess these diagnostic
mutations, the mutations likely arose early in the history of domestic dogs. Our results show that the small dog
haplotype is closely related to those in Middle Eastern wolves and is consistent with an ancient origin of the small
dog haplotype there. Thus, in concordance with past archeological studies, our molecular analysis is consistent
with the early evolution of small size in dogs from the Middle East.

Background
Domestic dogs exhibit a tremendous amount of phenotypic diversity in coat colour, skeletal proportion, and
behaviour [1-3]. Understanding the underlying causes of
this diversity has been a prime motivation for studies on
the evolutionary history of domestic dogs and the
genetic basis for phenotypic traits. The common ancestor of the domestic dog is the grey wolf [4-6]. However,
molecular genetic evidence suggests that there were
multiple domestication and/or interbreeding events
between domestic dogs and grey wolves [7-10]. The timing and location of the dog’s origin remains uncertain.
Mitochondrial DNA sequencing studies suggest an East
Asian origin with dates ranging from ~5000 to 16,000
years ago [4-6,11]. In contrast, archaeological studies

suggest a Middle Eastern, Western Russian or European
origin approximately 14,000-31,000 years ago [12-15].
In order to understand the molecular mechanism by
which domestic dogs have rapidly diversified in body
size, we previously identified a haplotype shared by small
dogs that underlies the major-effect quantitative trait
locus for size on dog chromosome 15 [16]. A ~75 kb
selectively swept haplotype was found spanning the
promoter, exon and introns of the IGF1 gene and was
strongly associated with skeletal size. Fine-mapping
demonstrated that a ~10 kb interval spanning intron 2 is
most strongly associated with size variation. A short
interspersed element SINEC_Cf integration and single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) are in perfect linkage
disequilibrium (LD) in this interval. These markers
are fixed in the majority of small distantly related dog
breeds which suggests that small size evolved early in the
history of domestication. Our previous study showed
that, with the exception of a few giant breeds (mastiffs,

bullmastiffs, and rottweilers, for example), the derived
‘small’ SNP allele was rarely observed in large dog breeds
[16]. Interestingly, the small size-associated haplotype
was not observed in any wild canid surveyed, ranging
from grey wolf (Canis lupus) to island fox (Urocyon littoralis). However, no extensive characterization of variation across IGF1 in grey wolf, the wild progenitor of
domestic dogs, was done. This characterization is critical
to the understanding of the evolutionary history of the
IGF1 gene and its role in the history of domestic dogs. In
this study, we survey a variety of grey wolf populations to
better understand the ancestral pattern of variation at
IGF1 with a particular focus on the distribution of the
small dog haplotype and its relationship to the origin of
the dog.

Results
Microsatellite, SNP and SINE (short interspersed elements)
markers within IGF1

The microsatellite located within the promoter region of
IGF1 (CAn; CanFam1 44283699-44283736; Figure 1) displayed a significant association with body size in the
domestic dog (P < 2.2 × 10-14, chi-square test) [16].
Specifically, the 207 base pair (bp) allele is associated
with large sized and the 211 bp allele is associated with
small sized domestic dogs. The microsatellite is in
strong linkage disequilibrium with the SINE element
and diagnostic SNP [16]. Although microsatellite alleles
found in grey wolf spanned the entire range observed in
dogs, the 209 bp allele, which is intermediate in length
to the two alleles associated with body size in dogs, was
found to have the highest frequency (41%) in 388 grey
wolves worldwide (Figure 2, Additional File 1, Table S1).
The completely overlapping allele sizes of grey wolves
and small and large domestic dogs suggest this locus is
not the causal mutation for small body size in dogs.
DNA sequence data confirmed the observation that no
grey wolf had the diagnostic SNP allele (CanFam1
44228468; Figure 1) found in the intron 2 region of
IGF1 in small dogs. Furthermore, we genotyped 374
grey wolves from 17 populations and 115 individuals
from five distantly related wild canids (Additional File 1:
Table S1) and found that no wild canid possessed the
SINE element. The retrotransposon insertion and the
diagnostic SNP allele appear to be unique to small
domestic dogs. Therefore, these markers evolved
uniquely in the domestic dog and are unlikely to have
been segregating in the wolf ancestors of dogs.
SNP Genotypes

In order to investigate the evolutionary history of the
IGF1 locus and the origin of the haplotypes found in
domestic dogs, we performed principal components analysis (PCA) on genotypes from 94 dog-derived SNP

markers spanning the IGF1 interval (Figure 1 and Additional File 1: Table S1 and S2; see Methods). Consistent
with species level classification, domestic dogs were distinct from grey wolves and coyotes on the first PCA
axis (Figure 3). On the second PCA axis, we observed
separation between small and large domestic dogs and
to a lesser extent between New World and Old World
grey wolves. Furthermore, grey wolves of Middle East
origin were slightly closer to domestic dogs than other
grey wolf populations on the first PCA axis. Several
Akita individuals, which is an ancient domestic dog
breed [17], were positioned between grey wolves and
the main cluster of domestic dogs (Figure 3). Outliers
such as large bodied Rottweiler and mastiff dog breeds
were observed within the small dog cluster. These
breeds were previously found to have unexpected
genetic similarity to small dogs in the IGF1 region [16].
The Boston terrier, which is the largest breed in our
‘small dog’ category, was the breed most associated with
the large breed cluster. However, a few individuals from
other small breeds were found there as well: cavalier
King Charles spaniel, Chihuahua, toy fox terrier, miniature schnauzer, Norwich terrier and Shih Tzu. Moreover, all except the Chihuahua were previously found to
exhibit some genetic similarity with large domestic dogs
across the IGF1 locus [16]. Phylogenetic analysis of the
SNP data defined a domestic dog cluster distinct from
grey wolves (Figure S1). Further, the majority of small
and large domestic dogs grouped separately from one
another. No further resolution within each species was
observed.
Individuals homozygous for the four most common of
the IGF1 20 SNP marker haplotypes (B, C, F and I; ‘Sutter haplotypes’; Additional File 2) were compared to
homologous grey wolf and coyote haplotypes. However,
haplotypes for only 17 of the 20 SNPs could be compared due to non-amplification of three SNPs in grey
wolves. The wolf haplotypes most similar to the common small dog haplotype B are found in Spanish (haplotypes 22, 29, 47, 48 and 50) and Israeli (haplotype 15)
wolves and differ from haplotype B by 3-4 substitutions
(Additional File 2). However, such a comparison is
intrinsically limited, since these SNPs were ascertained
in a restricted panel of domestic dogs. Therefore, grey
wolves may have additional variation that is undetected
when using domestic dogs as a reference that could be
informative for understanding the evolutionary history
of the IGF1 gene. Nonetheless, this result supports the
hypothesis that Middle East and Spanish wolves have
haplotypes closest to those of small dogs.
Long Sequence (6331 bp)

grey wolf populations, we sequenced 6331 base pairs

(bp) of intron 2 that directly surrounded the diagnostic
‘small’ SNP locus and the SINE element (Figure 1 and
Additional File 1: Table S1). Fourteen phased haplotypes
were identified from 30 SNPs and four indels (Additional File 3). We identified 13 private alleles in grey
wolves and 20 polymorphic loci. In the coyote, we identified 12 private alleles and 11 polymorphic loci. Domestic dogs exhibited two private alleles and two
polymorphic loci. However, these individuals were
selected to be homozygous for the common and minor
SNP haplotypes (see methods). In this analysis, grey
wolf haplotypes from Israel (haplotypes 11 and 13) were
most similar to haplotypes in small domestic dogs and
differed from the common small dog haplotype 5 by 3-4
substitutions (Table 1 and Additional File 3). The presence of the SINE element and ‘small’ SNP allele in
domestic dogs was responsible for two of the observed
differences. A minimum spanning network constructed
from pairwise nucleotide differences also exhibited a
close relationship between the small dog haplotypes
(Hap 5 and Hap 3) and haplotypes from Israel wolves
(Hap 11, 13, and 14; Figure S2). Two haplotypes (Hap 4
and Hap 6) were shared between domestic dogs and

grey wolves (Table 1). One Chinese and two Italian grey
wolves were homozygous for Hap 4, which was shared
with great Danes and Saint Bernards. One Alaskan and
two Yellowstone grey wolf individuals possessed Hap 6
which was shared with Shih Tzu and mastiff. Nucleotide
diversity was highest in coyote (0.00116, standard deviation [SD] 0.00082) followed by European grey wolves
(Italy and Spain; 0.00054, SD 0.00035), and Israeli grey
wolves (0.00047, SD 0.00037; Table 2).
A neighbour-joining tree was constructed from the
sequence data, which revealed that the common small
haplotype clustered with haplotypes from Israeli grey
wolves (68% bootstrap support; Figure 4). No other grey
wolf population or domestic dog breed was included in
this cluster. Furthermore, the small dog and all Israeli
grey wolf haplotypes were ancestral to the large domestic dog haplotypes and all other grey wolf haplotypes.
Haplotypes from large domestic dogs clustered with
grey wolves from Alaska, Yellowstone, Italy, Spain and
China (94% bootstrap support). Based on complete
DNA sequence information, these results support a
close affinity between the small dog haplotype and those
of Middle Eastern grey wolves.

Short Sequence (4811 bp)

In order to verify that the tree topology was not influenced by limited sampling of wild canids, eight additional grey wolf populations were sequenced for a
subset of the amplicons (4811 bp; Figure 1 and Additional File 1: Table S1). Amplicons were chosen to minimize cost but maximize the number of previously
discovered markers that could be sequenced (90% of
SNP variation retained; Additional File 1: Table S3).
Based on 28 SNPs and two indels, 21 haplotypes and
three novel SNPs were identified (Additional File 4).
One was private to coyotes (44230920), one was private
to Israeli grey wolves (44231203) and another was found
in Alaskan, Mexican, Israeli and Russian grey wolves
(44227271). Grey wolf haplotypes from Israel (haplotypes 17, 18, and 20) as well as India and Iran (haplotype 20) were closest to the common small dog
haplotype 4 and differed from it by 1-3 substitutions
(does not include SINE and diagnostic SNP; Additional
Files 3 and 4). A minimum spanning network constructed from pairwise nucleotide differences also exhibited a close relationship between the small dog
haplotype (Hap 3) and haplotypes from Israel, Indian
and Iranian wolves (Hap 17, 18, and 20; Figure S3).
Only two haplotypes (Hap5 and Hap7) were shared
between grey wolves and domestic dogs. Several grey
wolf populations shared haplotype 5 with the Great
Dane. These populations included Alaska, Belarus, Bulgaria, China, India, Iran, Israel, Italy and Ukraine.
Dachshunds, Shih Tzu and mastiff breeds shared haplotype 7 with Alaskan, Mexican, Yellowstone, Chinese and
Russian grey wolves. Nucleotide diversity was highest in
coyote (0.00111, SD ± 0.0081) followed by grey wolves
from the Middle East (0.00096, SD ± 0.00055; Table 2).

The Middle East sample set included Israel, Iran and
India. However, because Israeli grey wolf samples dominated the sample set (eight out of 11), we also estimated
nucleotide diversity for each population (Table 2). Iranian grey wolf nucleotide diversity was 0.00166 (SD ±
0.00176) and Indian grey wolf was 0.00083 (SD ±
0.00062). Israeli grey wolf nucleotide diversity was
0.00101 (SD ± 0.00058). Additionally, in order to
account for sampling bias in the Israeli grey wolves, two
individuals were sampled 1000 times and the median
nucleotide diversity was estimated to be 0.00055 (median; SD ± 0.00044). In all cases, wolves of Middle Eastern origin had the highest nucleotide diversity, second
only to coyote.
A neighbour-joining tree showed that the common
small dog haplotype clustered with Israeli grey wolf haplotypes as well as India and Iran. This cluster was distinct from the haplotypes associated with large dogs
(68% bootstrap support; Figure 5). The large dog-associated haplotypes were found to cluster with grey wolves
from all populations except Bulgaria, which fell just outside of this cluster. We also observed five Israeli, one
Indian and one Iranian grey wolf to be heterozygous for
the large dog haplotype 5 and one of several haplotype
variants (15, 17, 18, 20, 21) that clustered with the common small dog-associated haplotype (Figure 5 and Additional File 3). Again, we observe a close kinship between
the small dog-associated haplotype and haplotypes
observed in the Middle Eastern grey wolves.
Constraint trees

In order to further verify the topology of the phylogenetic trees that placed the common small dog haplotype
with Israeli grey wolf haplotypes, constraint trees were
constructed for the long and short sequence data. In
these trees, the common small dog-associated haplotype
was constrained to cluster with each of the large dog
haplotypes (Figures 4 and 5). For the 6331 bp dataset,
three constraint trees were constructed in which the
small dog-associated common haplotype (Hap 5) was
placed as a sister to Hap 6, to (Hap 7, Hap 12) and to
(Hap 4, Hap 8). For the 4811 bp dataset, three constraint trees were also constructed, in which Hap 3 was
constrained to be sister to (Hap 5, Hap 21), to Hap 7
and to (Hap 8, Hap 6). Maximum likelihood analyses of
the constraint trees confirm that the likelihoods of the
unconstrained trees were significantly better in all comparisons (P value < 0.001).
Recombination

Previously, a recombination point just 5’ of the diagnostic SNP locus (between 44228468 and 44235098) was
identified as a critical recombination locus between the
common and minor small dog-associated haplotypes

(haplotype B and C; see Methods) [16]. Ancestral
recombination graphs from the present study suggest a
similar recombination point between CanFam1 position
44230920 and 44231095 (SNPs 12, 20 in Figure S4 and
14, 15 in Figure S5). We note that 3’ of this recombination point the two small haplotypes have identical
sequences, whereas the 5’ side exhibits several SNP differences. In order to explore the effect recombination
may have had on tree topology, we constructed neighbour-joining trees for sequences on each side of the
recombination point for both sequence datasets (6331
bps and 4811 bps). The topology was similar across data

sets from each side of the recombination point. On the
3’ side, which contains the diagnostic small dog SNP
locus and SINE element, the large dog haplotypes clustered with haplotypes from all grey wolf populations,
except red wolves with bootstrap support of 65% (6331
bp dataset; Figure S6) and 64% (4811 bp dataset; Figure
S7). Israeli haplotypes were ancestral, or sister to, small
dog haplotypes in the 6331 bp dataset (Figure S6) and
small dog haplotypes were ancestral to those in all dogs
in the 4811 bp dataset (Figure S7). On the 5’ side of the
recombination point, many of the grey wolf haplotypes
and large domestic dog haplotypes were identical. All

but the common small dog haplotype, and several of the
Israeli (as well as Indian, Iranian and Russian) grey
wolf haplotypes, clustered with support values of 97%
(6331 bp dataset; Figure S8) and 88% (4811 bp dataset;
Figure S9).

Discussion
Previous research identified IGF1 as a major gene affecting skeletal size in domestic dogs [16]. In this study, we
examined genetic variation surrounding the IGF1 gene
in the progenitor of domestic dogs in order to uncover
the evolutionary history of the gene. This study confirms
the absence of the derived small SNP allele in the intron
2 region of IGF1 (CanFam1 44228468) in a large sample
of grey wolves and further establishes the absence of a
small dog associated SINE element in all wild canids
and most large dog breeds. Thus, the absence of both
the SINE element and SNP allele in wild canids suggests
that the mutation for small body size post-dates the
domestication of dogs. Presumably, the absence of these
two loci in wolves may reflect a unique recombination
event in domestic dogs. However, we find no evidence
of recombination between the SINE element and derived
SNP allele in domestic dogs and the derived SNP allele
distinguishes the associated common small (A, B and C)
and large (D-L) haplotypes. Additionally, because all
small dogs possess these diagnostic mutations, the small
size phenotype likely arose early in the history of
domestic dogs.
Although the alleles distinguishing small domestic
dogs from large domestic dogs have been identified, the
causal mutation for small body size has not been definitively determined. Microsatellite mutations have been
suggested as a potential source for rapid morphological
evolution in domestic dogs and the microsatellite
located in the promoter region of IGF1 could conceivably be the causal mutation [18]. However, we found that
the allelic range observed in large and small domestic
dogs was similar to that in grey wolves and coyotes,
which does not support this hypothesis. Synonymous
mutations in coding regions have been proposed to regulate gene expression and splicing [19-21]. From analysis of sequencing data, we found that the synonymous
SNP mutation within exon 3 was segregating in both
large and small domestic dogs as well as grey wolves,
which does not support this hypothesis. Although additional sequencing is needed in order to identify other
possible variants, the unique derived SINE element and
the SNP allele in intron 2 cannot be ruled out as candidates for the causative mutation. SINE elements have
been found to be widely distributed throughout the dog
genome and segregating in some breeds while fixed in
others [2,22]. Previous studies in domestic dogs have
identified SINE elements affecting coat colour variation,

hearing and sight disorders, narcolepsy, and myopathy
[23-25]. Additionally, Alu elements, the most frequent
SINE retrotransposon in humans, have been shown to
affect gene regulation and splicing of mRNA [26-28].
However, in the absence of any functional studies, any
conclusions about the role of the SNP allele and the
SINE element in size variation are speculative. Furthermore, the SNP allele and SINE element are not known
to be associated with any regulatory elements or splicing
site.
We investigated the progenitor population for the
small body size mutation by examining the PCA of 94
dog-derived SNP genotypes in a range of potential
ancestral grey wolf populations. The patterns observed
on the first two axes of variation were consistent with
known evolutionary history. On the first axis of variation, we observed separation of domestic dogs and grey
wolves, whereas along the second axis of variation we
observed a large separation between large and small
domestic dogs and a smaller separation between Old
World and New World wolves. We also observed a
slightly closer kinship of Middle Eastern grey wolves
with domestic dogs. Thus, SNP genotype data reveal
ancient and recent evolutionary relationships in wild
and domestic canids.
In order to explore this relationship further, we analysed sequence data directly spanning the diagnostic
SINE element and SNP locus. Nucleotide diversity estimates in grey wolf populations were highest in Middle
Eastern grey wolves for the 4811 bp dataset and European grey wolves for the 6331 bp dataset. However, the
4811 bp dataset contained the greatest number of samples per group, which should more accurately represent
diversity estimates. In this dataset, Middle Eastern grey
wolves had the greatest nucleotide diversity even when
sampling variation was taken into account by equalizing
the number of samples in the population. Haplotypes
from Middle Eastern grey wolves were consistently
found to have the greatest similarity to those in small
domestic dogs for both the 6331 bp and 4811 bp datasets. Additionally, phylogenetic analyses suggested a closer kinship of the common small domestic dog
haplotype with Middle Eastern grey wolf haplotypes.
Although bootstrap support values are not high, SNP
PCA and sequence analysis all are concordant with a
Middle Eastern origin for the small domestic dog
haplotypes.

Conclusions
The Middle East includes part of the Fertile Crescent
where farming began and was the origin of many
domesticated plants and animals including cereals, cats
and goats [29-32]. The region has been suggested as the
site of dog domestication based on archeological data

Gray et al. BMC Biology 2010, 8:16
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/8/16

[33,34]. Specifically, several archaeological sites in the
Middle East have some of the earliest domestic dog
remains, dating to 12,000 years ago [15,33]. However,
sites in Belgium, Germany and Western Russia contain
older remains (13,000-31,000 years ago) [12,13]. Many
of the domestic dogs from Middle Eastern sites are
small whereas those from Belgium, Germany and Western Russia are larger in size, which supports our
hypothesis that small body size evolved early in the history of domestic dogs and probably in the Middle East.
Reduction in body size is a common feature of domestication and appears early in other domesticated taxa
including cattle, pigs and goats [35-37]. Indeed it is a
morphological attribute researchers have used to distinguish early domestic dogs from their grey wolf progenitor [33,34]. Other features include shortening of the
muzzle, large crowned teeth and paedomorphic characteristics. Therefore, in concordance with past archeological studies, our molecular analysis provides strong
evidence for the early evolution of small size in dogs in
the Middle East, more than 12,000 years ago.
Genetic studies exploring the evolutionary history of
domestic dogs have focused primarily on mtDNA
[4-6,11,38,39]. Phylogenetic analysis and haplotype
diversity of mtDNA sequence data from a global sampling of grey wolves and domestic dogs specifically
suggested an East Asian origin for domestic dogs
[4,11]. By contrast, our results show that the small dog
haplotype is closely related to haplotypes in wolves
from the Middle East and is consistent with an ancient
origin in this region of small domestic dogs. Small
dogs have been recorded in 10,000 to 12,000 year old
burial sites in the Levant [15,33] and new SNP data
further suggest it as a primary centre for dog domestication [40]. The lack of concordance between mtDNA
and nuclear analysis could reflect differences in sampling, a female/male bias in dispersal or breed specific
bias in inbreeding and population size [4,41-43]. As
well as providing information about population history,
genes controlling morphological traits can provide
direct information about the selective and cultural context of domestication. Small size could have been more
desirable in more densely packed agrarian societies
where dogs may have lived partly indoors or in confined outdoor spaces. This study provides further evidence for the importance of a major size gene early in
the evolutionary history of dogs and implicates the
Levant culture as an initial source and selective agent
for small size in domestic dogs.

Methods
Datasets

Four molecular datasets were utilized in this study: (1)
SNP genotypes; (2) microsatellite genotypes; (3) SINE

Page 10 of 13

element genotypes; and (4) DNA sequences. The datasets were generated at different times and contained
different but overlapping sets of samples (Additional
File 1: Table S1). First, for a broad exploration of the
IGF1 gene region, 94 SNP loci were genotyped utilizing
the SNPlex system (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA).
These SNPs are a subset of 116 SNPs that successfully
amplified in domestic dogs and wild canids and were
originally characterized in Sutter et al. [16]. They were
ascertained in nine dogs from small and large breeds
that were chosen to cover all major IGF1 haplotypes
identified to that point. The SNPs span the entire IGF1
gene (Figure 1; Additional File 1: Table S2). Samples
genotyped include 15 large domestic dog breeds
(>30 kg; n = 234), 23 small domestic dog breeds (<9 kg;
n = 340), 11 grey wolf populations (n = 119) and one
coyote population (n = 21) (Additional File 1: Table S2).
Second, a dinucleotide microsatellite (CAn; CanFam1
44283699-44283736) in the promoter region of IGF1,
that was previously found to have a significant association to body size [16], was typed in 18 small domestic
dog breeds (n = 554), 13 large domestic dog breeds (n =
390), 16 grey wolf populations (n = 388) and two coyote
populations (n = 54).
Third, the antisense-oriented retrotransposon
(SINEC_Cf; CanFam1 44228010-44228230) and derived
SNP allele (CanFam1 44228468), which are diagnostic
for small dogs, were genotyped in 17 grey wolf populations (n = 374) and six distantly related species including the coyote (n = 100), golden jackal (n = 16),
Ethiopian wolf (n = 20), bat-eared fox (n = 20), grey fox
(n = 33) and Channel Island fox (n = 26).
Finally, DNA sequencing of IGF1 was carried out and
performed in two stages (Additional File 1: Table S1
and S2). First, 6331 bp directly surrounding the SNP
and SINE element of the intron 2 region of IGF1 were
sequenced using Sanger sequencing. Samples sequenced
included: six grey wolf populations (n = 10) and seven
domestic dog breeds (n = 8). In small dogs, one common haplotype (B) and one minor haplotype (C) were
previously found to be diagnostic for small body size
(see Figure 3b and 3c of Sutter et al. [16]). Likewise, in
large dogs, one common haplotype (I) and one minor
haplotype (F) were diagnostic for large body size. Five
domestic dogs were selected that were homozygous for
each of the large dog haplotypes and three domestic
dogs were selected that were homozygous for the small
dog haplotypes. The shih tzu samples were selected
because they were homozygous for the common large
dog haplotype, which was previously observed in several
small dogs [16]. Second, an additional eight grey wolf
populations (n = 10) and two Dachshunds were
sequenced for 4811 bp across the same region. We
increased our sampling to ensure that we captured all

Gray et al. BMC Biology 2010, 8:16
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/8/16

potential source populations for small dogs. However, in
order to reduce effort and cost, we sequenced only
amplicons which were found to contain the majority of
the SNP variation (~90%; Additional File 1: Table S3).
Blood, tissue or buccal swabs were collected from
sampled individuals. Genomic DNA from blood and tissue was extracted by a standard phenol-chloroform protocol. DNA from buccal swabs was extracted using the
Blood Midi Kit (Qiagen, CA, USA). All samples were
stored at -20°C for short-term storage and -80°C for
long-term storage. For samples with low DNA concentrations, whole genome amplification was performed
using the REPLI-g kit according to manufacturer guidelines (Qiagen). All domestic dog sampled were purebred
and registered with the American Kennel Club. Pedigrees were used to choose samples that were unrelated
to one another at the grandparent level. Grey wolf samples were chosen to be globally distributed and representative of all major populations. SNP genotypes were
amplified on the SNPlex system following the manufacturer’s guidelines (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA). Bidirectional sequences were polymerase chain reaction
amplified and cleaned with exonuclease/shrimp alkaline
phosphate following standard protocols. Primers for all
loci and sequenced amplicons can be found in the supplemental material of Sutter et al. [16] (see Additional
File 1: Tables S2 and S3 for SNP and sequence position). Genotype and sequence data were collected on an
ABI 3730 (Applied Biosystems). Genemapper 4.0 was
used to make genotype calls for each SNP, microsatellite, and SINE element locus (Applied Biosystems).
Sequence polymorphisms were identified and viewed
using Phred/Phrap/Consed/Polyphred [44-47].
Analysis

PCA was performed using Egigenstrat [48]. The software program PHASE was used to infer haplotypes
across each species and region (that is, domestic dogs,
New World grey wolves, Old World grey wolves, coyotes) [49,50]. Phased haplotypes were used as the operational taxonomic unit in phylogenetic analysis (see
below). Lastly, Arlequin was used to calculate nucleotide
diversity and minimum spanning networks [51].
Prior to phylogenetic analysis, jModelTest [52] was
run on the sequence data to determine the best mutation model, transition/transversion ratio (ti/tv) and
gamma distribution parameter. Phylogenetic analysis
was performed on phased haplotypes using PHYLIP
[53]. Majority-rule consensus neighbour-joining trees
were constructed from 1000-10,000 bootstrap replications. Constraint trees were generated with the Retree
function and then run under maximum likelihood in
PHYLIP in order to compare resulting likelihood values

to the unconstrained tree. For the full 6331 bp sequence
dataset, an F81 mutation model was used with a gamma
distribution parameter of 0.015 and ti/tv ratio of 4.6.
For the partial 4811 bps sequence dataset, an F81 mutation model was used with a gamma distribution parameter of 0.0110 and a ti/tv ratio of 6.8. The software
SHRUB was used to construct ancestral recombination
graphs http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~yssong/lu.html.
SHRUB uses a branch and bound method to calculate
the minimum number of recombination events necessary to explain the data.
