Abstract
Background: Evolutionary analyses of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RPB1) have
yielded important and at times provocative results. One particularly troublesome outcome is the
consistent inference of independent origins of red algae and green plants, at odds with the more
widely accepted view of a monophyletic Plantae comprising all eukaryotes with primary plastids. If
the hypothesis of a broader kingdom Plantae is correct, then RPB1 trees likely reflect a persistent
phylogenetic artifact. To gain a better understanding of RNAP II evolution, and the presumed
artifact relating to green plants and red algae, we isolated and analyzed RPB1 from representatives
of Glaucocystophyta, the third eukaryotic group with primary plastids.
Results: Phylogenetic analyses incorporating glaucocystophytes do not recover a monophyletic
Plantae; rather they result in additional conflicts with the most widely held views on eukaryotic
relationships. In particular, glaucocystophytes are recovered as sister to several amoebozoans with
strong support. A detailed investigation shows that this clade can be explained by what we call
"short-branch exclusion," a phylogenetic artifact integrally associated with "long-branch attraction."
Other systematic discrepancies observed in RPB1 trees can be explained as phylogenetic artifacts;
however, these apparent artifacts also appear in regions of the tree that support widely held views
of eukaryotic evolution. In fact, most of the RPB1 tree is consistent with artifacts of rate variation
among sequences and co-variation due to functional constraints related to C-terminal domain
based RNAP II transcription.
Conclusion: Our results reveal how subtle and easily overlooked biases can dominate the overall
results of molecular phylogenetic analyses of ancient eukaryotic relationships. Sources of potential
phylogenetic artifact should be investigated routinely, not just when obvious "long-branch
attraction" is encountered.

Background
Evolutionary analyses of RNA polymerases, and RNA
polymerase II (RNAP II) in particular, have provided
important phylogenetic inferences about ancient evolu-

tion. The RNAP largest subunit has played a key role in
resolving such widely accepted hypotheses as the three
domains of life [1,2] and putative affiliation of the "longbranch" Microsporidia with fungi [3]; however, one parPage 1 of 17

ticular inference of eukaryotic relationships based upon
the RNAP II largest subunit (RPB1) has proven controversial. RPB1 sequences consistently recover a polyphyletic
kingdom Plantae, with independent origins of red algae
and green plants [4-9]. This result is in conflict with a
growing consensus on eukaryotic relationships from
other molecular phylogenetic analyses (see [10] for
review).
The hypothesis that red algae are related closely to green
algae and plants grew out of sequence-based phylogenetic
analyses of plastid-based characters (see [11] and [12] for
seminal early reviews). A monophyletic association of
most plastid-based molecular characters lent support to
the hypothesis of a single plastid origin [13]. Because both
red algae and green plants have "primary" plastids
(thought to be descended directly from a cyanobacterial
endosymbiont) it is reasonable to assume that plastids
originated in the common host cell ancestor of the two
groups [12]. Although these data also can be reconciled
with polyphyletic plastid origins [14,15], analyses of a
number of nuclear genes likewise recover a monophyletic
association of the red and green host cell lines [7,16] (but
see [17] for alternative result). Congruence among a
number of molecular phylogenies, from both host cell
and plastid-based characters, has led to general acceptance
of the hypothesis that all photosynthetic eukaryotes with
primary plastids share a common ancestor [18-21]. This
consensus view of plant evolution even has been incorporated into the phylogenetic treatment of eukaryotes in
major biology textbooks [22-24]. Consequently, a
polyphyletic Plantae recovered in RPB1 analyses typically
is interpreted as a phylogenetic artifact [13,16,19,20].
As part of a general investigation of RNAP II evolution and
function, we have examined this persistent phylogenetic
conflict between RPB1 and other molecular analyses. A
key taxon missing from previous RPB1 surveys was the
Glaucocystophyta, a small, enigmatic group of photosynthetic protists also believed to harbor primary plastids
[25-27]. Although relatively uncommon in nature
[28,29], glaucocystophytes have intrigued phycologists
and evolutionary biologists for over a century because of
their cyanelles, photosynthetic organelles with characteristics intermediate between those of derived plastids and
cyanobacteria. Historically, the pigments and vestigial
peptidoglycan cell wall of cyanelles were taken as evidence of an intermediate relationship between the glaucocystophyte host cell and more recently acquired
endosymbiont [29]. Current views hold that cyanelles and
plastids have descended from the same endosymbiotic
cyanobacterial ancestor [18-20,27], and phylogenetic
analyses of large, multi-gene plastid and nuclear data sets
both provide strong support for a monophyletic association of glaucocystophytes with red algae and green plants

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/71

[21]. As the potential "missing link" in the evolution of
primary eukaryotic photosynthesis, glaucocystophytes
could provide ancestral data for clarifying the origins of
red and green plants and overcoming phylogenetic artifacts that produce conflicts among molecular data.
We sequenced the complete RPB1 gene from Glaucocystis
nostochinearum Itz., including the region encoding the Cterminal domain (CTD), as well as a partial sequence
from Cyanophora paradoxa Korsh. Here we report comparative analyses of inferred protein sequences from these
two species and a broad sample of other eukaryotes in an
effort to understand the overall topology of the RPB1 tree,
and the specific branching positions of green plants, red
algae and glaucocystophytes.

Results and Discussion
Characterization of RPB1 from Glaucocystophytes
Most molecular analyses of the Glaucocystophyta have
focused on Cyanophora; therefore, we made an effort to
recover RPB1 from it and Glaucocystis. We encountered
several technical problems, however, in our attempts to
sequence the complete gene from Cyanophora. First, a persistent PCR artifact occurred with 3' RACE (Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends), preventing direct recovery of
sequence distal to conserved region G [30]. In addition,
we identified two distinct RPB1 sequences from Cyanophora. Although they differ only at synonymous positions,
the presence of two sequences complicated efforts to isolate a single contiguous gene product through standard RT
(reverse transcription) and PCR methods. Therefore, we
concentrated on recovering the complete RPB1 gene from
Glaucocystis.

The most interesting overall feature of Glaucocystis RPB1 is
that it encodes a typical RNAP II C-terminal domain
(CTD). In its canonical form, the CTD comprises tandemly repeated heptapeptides with the consensus
sequence Y1-S2-P3-T4-S5-P6-S7 [31]. These heptapeptides
act as a platform for various proteins functionally associated with RNAP II transcription. CTD-protein interactions
help regulate gene expression, couple transcription to premRNA processing and post-transcriptional silencing, and
generally coordinate nuclear function [32-35]. The CTD is
missing or degenerate in many eukaryotic groups, but is
conserved across the broad diversity of animals and fungi,
as well as their putative protistan ancestors [4]. This strong
conservation is not surprising, given numerous and essential CTD functions in mRNA synthesis.
Although its biochemical interactions are not as well-characterized as in animals and yeast, the CTD also is present
in all green algae and plants examined to date [36]; based
on comparative genomic analyses, core CTD-protein
interactions also appear to be conserved across all of these

groups [37]. Given this strong conservation of CTD form
and function, it is reasonable to conclude that the
protistan ancestor of green plants and algae also used
CTD-based RNAP II transcription. In this light, the presence of a CTD in glaucocystophytes is consistent with the
hypothesis that they share a common ancestor with green
plants, and lends support to a broader kingdom Plantae
including other eukaryotes with primary plastids. By the
same token, the most straightforward explanation for the
absence of a conserved CTD in most red algae [38] is that
rhodophytes do not share a common ancestor with green
plants and glaucocystophtyes.
As discussed previously, phylogenetic analyses of RPB1
sequences likewise have indicated that red algae originated independently of a common ancestor of green
plants, fungi, animals and related protists. It is precisely in
these latter eukaryotic groups that the CTD is invariably
conserved, suggesting that CTD-based RNAP II transcription was canalized in their common ancestor [4]. If the
now widely accepted hypothesis of a monophyletic Plantae is accurate, then both a "CTD-clade" and the independent origin of red algae inferred from RPB1 sequences
must result from a tree-building artifact. A recent genomelevel investigation of the CTD and its attendant proteins
provides an explanation for just such an artifact: the CTDclade recovered in RPB1 phylogenies reflects parallel functional constraints on RNAP II and related proteins, rather
than historical signal retained in their sequences [37]. If
true, then the polyphyly of green plants and red algae represents a phylogenetic artifact of sequence covariation
[39] resulting from selection for differing mechanics of
RNAP II transcription among eukaryotic lineages. The
inclusion of glaucocystophyte sequences in RPB1 analyses
might provide ancestral information that could help overcome such an artifact.
Phylogenetic analyses of RPB1 sequences
The addition of glaucocystophyte RPB1 sequences does
not yield a monophyletic Plantae. Both maximum-likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference still recover a "CTDclade" (Figure 1); it includes green plants and glaucocystophytes but not red algae. Even more problematic is an
unexpected but strongly supported clade grouping glaucocystophytes with Acanthamoeba and Dictyostelium, members of the Amoebozoa [10,40,41]. To sample as broadly
as possible, we included a number of partially sequenced
genes (including Cyanophora RPB1) in our 47-taxon analysis; as a result, the alignment (available upon request)
incorporates large blocks of missing data. In an effort to
ameliorate potential sources of phylogenetic artifact, we
aligned 30 of the most complete RPB1 sequences retaining multiple representatives of major lineages. We also
excluded Giardia and the microsporidians. Although these
sequences are complete, Giardia is the strongest source of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/71

"long-branch attraction" in RPB1 analyses [6,9]. Likewise,
the microsporidians are a potentially significant source of
phylogenetic artifact [3], particularly with respect to the a
priori expectation that amoebozoans will associate with
Opisthokonts (animals + fungi) [10].
Eliminating partial sequences and "long-branch" taxa has
little effect on the tree topology. Glaucocystis still associates
strongly with Acanthamoeba and Dictyostelium in Bayesian
inference, ML and distance bootstrap analyses (Figure 2).
This grouping also is recovered in parsimony analyses, but
with low bootstrap support (see below). In addition, the
"CTD-clade" is recovered using all four standard phylogenetic methods, although generally without strong support. This poses a number of problems with respect to
leading hypotheses of eukaryotic relationships. Entamoeba, which has no CTD, is excluded from the CTD-clade
containing other amoebozoans. The diatom Thalassiosira
groups with CTD-containing taxa, not with ciliates and
apicomplexans as predicted by the "Chromalveolate
hypothesis" [42,43]. Finally, as noted above, red algae do
not group with green plants and glaucocystophytes as predicted by the kingdom Plantae hypothesis. In fact, with
this data set a monophyletic Plantae is rejected significantly in both KH and SH tests (P = 0.002 and 0.001
respectively); this appears to be due largely to the strong
association of glaucocystophytes and amoebozoans, as
support for a polyphyletic Plantae is reduced when Acanthamoeba and Dictyostelium are removed from the data set
(KH, P = 0.054; SH, P = 0.007). We therefore undertook a
detailed investigation to determine why RPB1 sequences
generate such an unorthodox tree topology, beginning
with the positions of Glaucocystis, Dictyostelium and Acanthamoeba.
Why might some amoebozoans group with
glaucocystophytes?
The strong association between the two amoebozoans
and glaucocystophytes would appear to have one of three
explanations: 1) they are, indeed, evolutionary sister
groups; 2) their pairing reflects an ancient lateral gene
transfer (LGT) of RPB1 from a glaucocystophyte to the
common ancestor of Acanthamoeba and Dictyostelium; or
3) their association is a phylogenetic artifact. Although the
first explanation cannot be rejected outright, molecular
analyses usually group amoebozoans with animals and
fungi [7,10,40], and we can find no consequential evidence (outside the RPB1 phylogeny presented here) to
support a relationship between amoebae and glaucocystophytes. Thus, we presume that the RPB1 tree topology
does not accurately reflect organismal relationships.

Likewise, given the number of co-adapted proteins interacting to form the RNAP II holoenzyme [44,45], not to
mention associated general and specific transcription fac-

Figure 2, but without ML branch lengths. The CTD-clade is shaded in light blue. From bottom to top, the following are provided for each sequence. 1) CTD: "+" above a sequence indicates that it contains a C-terminal sequence that is consistent
with known requirements for CTD function [36, 86, 87]. 2) aa χ2: results of ML analysis of deviation from mean amino acid
composition for each sequence. A "*" indicates that the sequence deviates significantly (P < 0.05) from average composition.
" " denotes a χ2 P value > 0.9, indicating that the sequence deviates little from average composition. 3) Autapomorphies:
Blue bars show the number of unique substitutions at sites under strong stabilizing selection across eukaryotic diversity. Numbers tend to be suppressed in taxa with multiple representatives, because synapomorphies uniting the group are not scored.
For example, all kinetoplastids share a number of unique substitutions at otherwise invariable sites. If only one kinetoplastid
were to be included, the number of autapomorphies would be comparable to Tv and Eh (data not shown, but see figure 5 for
examples from animal, fungal and plant clades). 4) Random Sequence Attraction: Bars show the number of equally parsimonious trees on which each of 100 randomly generated sequences attached to specific RPB1 sequences in parsimony analyses. Red indicates a significant attraction to random sequences (in greater than 5% of parsimony replicates). Because many
replicates produced more than one equally parsimonious tree, numbers do not add up to 100. A bar extending across multiple
taxa indicates that the random sequence attached to the internode supporting that group (for example, the long branch leading
to the three kinetoplastids). RPB1 sequences that were significant poles of attraction were removed from the alignment and
the analysis repeated. Four separate analyses were performed, each with 100 randomly generated sequences. The lowest graph
shows results using the entire data set, with decreasing numbers of sequences in the graphs above. Sequences shaded out in
gray were removed based on significant "long-branch attraction" in the analysis shown immediately below.

tors [46,47], LGT of the largest subunit seems exceedingly
unlikely. These complications are only exacerbated if
RPB1 anchors additional co-adapted CTD-protein interactions [32,34,35]. Moreover, a comparison of intron positions gives no indication of a glaucocystophyte ancestry
for the Acanthamoeba RPB1 gene (Dictyostelium RPB1 contains no introns), nor are there any diagnostic indels to
suggest such a relationship (alignment and intron data
available upon request). Thus, with the exception of
RPB1-based phylogenies, there is no evidence to suggest
LGT between glaucocytophytes and amoebozoans. If conflicting gene phylogenies represent its only support, LGT
is an unfalsifiable hypothesis. Any phylogenetic conflict
can be resolved by invoking lateral transfer among the
misbehaving taxa. Therefore, although neither of the first
two hypotheses can be ruled out absolutely, we concentrated on the prospect that phylogenetic artifacts are
responsible for the glaucocystophyte + amoebozoan
grouping.
Analyses of potential sources of phylogenetic artifacts
Neither the Glaucocystis sequence, nor those of Dictyostelium and Acanthamoeba, deviate significantly from ML estimated mean amino acid frequencies (Figure 3). In fact, in
χ2 analysis for each of the three sequences, P was greater
than 0.9, indicating that they deviate very little from overall mean frequencies. The majority of sequences in the
alignment do not deviate significantly from the average,
many also at P > 0.9 (designated by stars in Figure 3).
Thus, biases in estimated amino acid composition are
insufficient to account for the glaucocystophyte + amoebozoan clade.

A disproportionate number of unique substitutions (at
sites under strong stabilizing selection throughout eukaryotic evolution) can provide prima facie evidence of an
increased evolutionary rate independent of any presumed
tree topology [48]. By this measure, Glaucocystis and the
two amoebozoans are among the most slowly evolving
sequences (Figure 3), although a number of others have
accumulated comparably few substitutions at highly conserved sites. Nonetheless Glaucocystis displays the fewest
unique substitutions of any monotypic representative of
an ancient eukaryotic lineage (Figure 3). Thus, in terms of
both amino acid composition and the accumulation of
autapomorphies, RPB1 genes from Glaucocystis and the
two amoebozoans have changed less from their ancestral
sequences than have those of most other taxa.
To assess the empirical tendency of RPB1 sequences to
attract "long branches," we examined the behavior of randomly generated sequences of average amino acid composition. With the alignment including all 30 taxa, none of
100 random sequences was attracted to Glaucocystis, Acanthamoeba or Dictyostelium in any most parsimonious tree

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/71

recovered (Figure 3). When significant points of longbranch attraction (LBA) were removed from the alignment, these three sequences still did not attract randomly
generated "long branches." In fact, even when only the 11
RPB1 genes least prone to attract "long branches" were
retained in the analysis, Glaucocystis, Acanthamoeba and
Dictyostelium still attracted the fewest randomly generated
sequences. Remarkably, given that it is the sole representative of an ancient lineage, Glaucocystis attracted only one
random sequence in all of the analyses performed, the
fewest for any taxon in our investigation. Furthermore,
Glaucocystis was the only monotypic representative to survive into the final round of random sequence addition
(Figure 3).
The results of three separate analyses of "long-branch"
indicators show that sequences of Glaucocystis, Acanthamoeba and Dictyostelium are highly unlikely to be
drawn together by "long-branch attraction." Rather, they
appear to be among the most slowly diverging RPB1 genes
(Fig 3). What then accounts for their recovery as a strongly
supported clade? The tendency to attract a randomly generated sequence correlates with how randomized a given
sequence has become with respect to its phylogenetic relatives – in other words, how much it has diverged from its
most recent shared ancestral sequence. In 100 tests using
the complete RPB1 data set, as well as in previous investigations of other gene sequences [6,48], two random
sequences included in an alignment always attract each
other. Four-sequence simulated phylogenies yield comparable results for completely and partially randomized
sequences [49], although sequences with an intermediate
level of randomization can actually repel long branches
under the conditions modeled.
In large trees with complex hierarchical structure, random
sequences virtually never attach to individual members of
a clade of closely related taxa, even when its members display accelerated substitution rates. For example, although
randomly generated sequences attach to the long internode leading to kinetoplastids in 32% of parsimony replicates (Figure 3), none are attracted to any of three
sequences individually. This tendency mirrors the accumulation of unique substitutions at otherwise strongly
conserved sites (Figure 3) [6,48], further supporting random sequence attraction as a measure of relative sequence
divergence. Therefore, if the Glaucocystis + amoebozoans
clade is indeed artifactual, it is probably because their
genes are the least derived from their common ancestral
sequence; that is, they cluster on the basis of shared,
ancestral positions lost from other taxa. Their overall similarity excludes randomized sequences from attaching to
an individual branch within the group; this apparently
extends to other more divergent RPB1 sequences as well.

Although similar groupings have been uncovered with
other molecular data sets [6,48,50], phylogenetic artifacts
typically are viewed as "long-branch" effects resulting
from the sequences that have experienced rapid or otherwise unusual modes of divergence [51]. As a result, these
sequences are considered suspect, whereas those with
lower than average rates typically are assumed to perform
well in phylogenetic reconstruction. By definition, however, if a LBA artifact is present, then there also must be an
artificial clustering of more slowly evolving taxa that
should group with the respective long-branch sequences.
We offer the phrase "short-branch exclusion" (SBE) to
identify this associated artifact (Figure 4A). The SBE phenomenon uncovered in our analyses is consistent with
demonstrated artifacts caused by differences in the proportion of variable sites (Pvar) across lineages [52]; this
kind of complexity in rate variation can dominate treebuilding signal in ancient phylogenetic reconstruction,
including among sequences with low proportions of variable sites (that is, "slowly-evolving" taxa) [53]. The unexpected clustering of Glaucocystis and two amoebozoans,
along with consistent evidence that the three are among
the least diverged sequences in the analysis, give all the
indications of such a "short-branch" artifact (Figure 4B).
Phylogenetic artifacts and global tree topology
As noted above, the overall RPB1 tree topology and the
specific positions of red algae, Thalassiosira and Entamoeba
are consistent with recovery of a "CTD-clade," comprising
all eukaryotic lineages in which the CTD has been strongly
conserved while excluding those where it has been
allowed to degenerate (Figures 2, 3). Originally this
"CTD-clade" was hypothesized to be a natural group
descended from a common ancestor in which CTD-based
RNAP II transcription had coalesced [4,38]. More recent
genome-level investigations of the CTD and its protein
partners [37,54] indicate that the CTD-clade can be
explained alternatively by parallel functional constraints
in organisms that use CTD-based transcription, which
lead to correlated patterns of RPB1 sequence evolution.
Thus, the major discrepancies between the RPB1 tree and
more widely accepted views of eukaryotic evolution (Figure 2) can be reconciled as artifacts of short-branch exclusion, and parallel or convergent evolution due to
covariation in the mode of selection on the RPB1 molecule.

At first inspection it appears reassuring that analytical artifacts can explain apparent phylogenetic anomalies, specifically the recovery of a polyphyletic Plantae. Although red
algal RPB1 genes are not particularly fast-evolving with
respect to most eukaryotes, they exhibit greater "longbranch" tendencies than do sequences from other members of the hypothesized kingdom Plantae. Along with
differing functional constraints on CTD-based RNAP II

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/71

transcription, these subtle rate differences could explain
the presumed artifact in RPB1 trees. Our investigation of
"long-branch" indicators, however, raises a more general
issue with respect to the global RPB1 tree; virtually the
entire topology of the RPB1 tree is disturbingly consistent
with those same sources of artifact. For example, if suspect
and inconsistent tree-rootings are discounted, the branching position of alveolates is generally consistent with phylogenomic treatments [7,16]. In RPB1 analyses, this
position is associated with a clade comprising the four
most identifiable "long-branches," Entamoeba, Trichomonas, Mastigamoeba, and kinetoplastids. When the latter sequences are excluded, however, alveolates also
display disproportionate long-branch tendencies (Figure
3). In effect, their branching position is consistent with a
"long-branch attraction" artifact. Even within the CTDclade – composed of sequences with the lowest rates and
otherwise average patterns of divergence (Figure 3) – relationships among well-established groups are consistent
with apparent rate variation among sequences.
As a function of overall within-clade similarity, individual
green plants and animals (with the exception of
Chlamydomonas) do not attract random sequences, nor do
they show an accumulation of unique substitutions (Figure 3). Behavior of the internodes leading to these clades,
however, suggests that their individual sequences may
represent somewhat "longer branches" than those of
Glaucocystis, Dictyostelium or Acanthamoeba (Figure 3).
Therefore, we analyzed unique substitutions and random
sequence behavior using the representative sequence with
the fewest "long-branch" tendencies from each group:
human from animals, Oryza from plants, Schizosaccarhomyces from fungi, and Dicytostelium from amoebozoans. In this analysis, the relative short-branch
tendencies of Dictyostelium and Glaucocystis become even
more pronounced (Figure 5A), and their clustering is consistent with an SBE artifact (Figure 5B). Moreover, the
green plant Oryza, recovered as sister to the Glaucocystis/
Dictyostelium clade, has the next fewest "long-branch"
indicators. The human + Schizosaccharomyces clade, which
corresponds to the widely accepted systematic hypothesis
of the Opisthokonta, then could be explained as a LBA
artifact localized within a group of generally more slowlyevolving sequences. In model-based ML analyses, the
branches leading to these two sequences have nearly twice
the substitution-per-site probability of those for Glaucocystis and Dictyostelium, and five to ten times the probability of the two internodes that define overall branching
order (Figure 5B).
Direct evidence that such localized LBA can occur in phylogenetic reconstruction is immediately apparent in parsimony analyses of the RPB1 data set. Although it is a longbranch taxon compared to other green algae and plants,

Parsimony tree based on RPB1 sequences showing a clear example of "localized LBA."
Figure 6
Parsimony tree based on RPB1 sequences showing a clear example of "localized LBA." The green alga Chlamydomonas groups
with other green plants and algae in model-based approaches, but is attracted to the diatom Thalassiosira using parsimony.
These sequences represent the two "longest branches" within the CTD clade, but do not share any other sub-clade affiliation
in the RPB1 tree (Figure 2). This grouping demonstrates that LBA and SBE are not simply global effects, but can cause more
localized artifacts as well. Note also that, in parsimony, Glaucocystis groups specifically with Dictyostelium, the shorter branched
of the two amoebozoans (Figures 3, 5).

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2005, 5:71

Chlamydomonas is placed correctly using likelihood and
Bayesian algorithms (Figures 1, 2). In parsimony it falls
victim to long-branch attraction. Rather than attaching to
the strongest sources of LBA (Entamoeba, Trichomonas,
kinetoplastids [see Figure 3]), however, Chlamydomonas is
attracted to the diatom Thalassiosira (Figure 6) and the two
emerge as the deepest branch of the CTD-clade. LBA pulls
Chlamydomonas away from other green plant sequences,
but unknown evolutionary constraints (apparently
related to CTD-based transcription [37]) prevent it from
being drawn completely out of the CTD-clade. Thus, the
two longest branches that are constrained to fall within
the CTD-clade attach to each other.
Generally it has been the case in sequence-based phylogenies that well-defined evolutionary lineages (green plants,
animals, fungi, red algae, etc.) exclude other sequences
and form strongly supported clades. This occurs even if a
lineage has a generally high divergence rate (e.g. kinetoplastids in this study), so long as its members have not
diverged too far from their common ancestral sequence.
The challenge of deep molecular systematics has been to
determine the relationships among these well-defined
groups. When the potential for localized tree artifacts is
considered, the overall relationships of these groups on
the RPB1 tree are consistent with a combination of biases
identified in the data. This is true even in those regions of
the tree where sequences are undergoing relatively slow
and comparable modes of evolution (Figure 5). In fact,
the cumulative effects of artifacts can explain the entire
backbone of relationships among major eukaryotic lineages (Figure 4C), and no signal from an historical pattern
of relationships appears to be required. Given the number
of putatively misplaced taxa (Figure 2), the implicit
assumption that most regions of the tree reflect true evolutionary history is unwarranted.
Broader implications for deep phylogenetics
The fact that a phylogeny is consistent with data biases
does not exclude the possibility that the tree accurately
reflects evolutionary history. It does say, however, that the
null hypotheses cannot be rejected; that is, that random
effects and/or data biases account for the pattern recovered (implicit in all phylogenetic analyses). Consequently, the alternative hypotheses that the tree is based
on historical signal cannot be accepted.

It is possible that the RPB1 tree shown in figure 2 truly
depicts the pattern of eukaryotic evolution. Given conflicts with other data sets, and the fact that much of its
topology can be explained by rate variation and parallel
constraint, it is more reasonable to conclude that the
RPB1 tree is rife with phylogenetic artifacts. This assessment can be made because of accumulated data in three
areas, which are unavailable for most sequences used in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/71

phylogenetic analyses of ancient evolution. First, RPB1
structure, function and biochemical interactions are well
characterized, providing the framework for recognizing
different functional constraints among taxa [37]. Second,
extensive analyses of "long-branch" indicators have been
performed, including for regions of the tree that do not
appear to be subject to LBA by highly divergent sequences.
Finally, topological incongruence exists between the RPB1
tree and more widely accepted hypotheses of eukaryotic
relationships, providing an impetus to investigate specific
discrepancies. Of course, in arguing that artifacts dominate RPB1 phylogenies we have assumed those broadly
held hypothetical relationships to be true. Given the evidence of pervasive artifacts uncovered here, and in many
other molecular phylogenetic studies of deep relationships as well [6,48,50,52,53,55-60], that assumption
must be considered provisional.
Recent phylogenetic inferences of deep eukaryotic evolution have been made using large multi-gene data sets. The
conclusions from these phylogenomic investigations have
replaced an earlier model of global eukaryotic evolution
based on small subunit ribosomal RNA sequences (SSU
rDNA). At just about the time the SSU rDNA tree was
adopted by major textbooks, it came under greater scrutiny largely due to developing conflicts with other molecular data sets [61-64]. Analyses of long-branch indicators
demonstrated that the global topology of the rDNA tree
was more consistent with variation in mode and tempo of
evolution among sequences than with historical pattern
[48]. The detailed analyses presented here suggest that the
same is true of RPB1 sequences. Yet there is no reason to
presume that these two genes are unusually prone to artifact.
As the gene encoding the largest subunit of RNAP II, RPB1
has the attributes of a reliable phylogenetic marker. It supplies a coding region of about 5 kb, over half of which
consists of conserved domains that can be aligned reliably
across most of eukaryotic diversity; this a relatively large
data set for a single-gene phylogeny. It performs the same
core function in all eukaryotes. There is no evidence that
RPB1 has been carried as a multi-gene family over broad
stretches of eukaryotic evolution, reducing the chance of
paralogous sampling. Indeed, RPB1 phylogenetic analyses
have been robust in the face of long-branch artifacts that
plague microsporidian sequences in many other data sets
[3], and parametric methods can overcome clearly identifiable phylogenetic artifacts that occur using parsimony
(see discussion of Chlamydomonas above). Therefore, it is
a reasonable to conclude that the biases found in RPB1
sequences are comparable to, if not less than, those
present in most molecular markers. Indeed, Lockhart and
colleagues [53] showed that changing distributions of
sites that are variable and invariable can explain global

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2005, 5:71

tree topologies among major eubacterial lineages, suggesting that sequence-based phylogenies may provide little
valid information about these ancient historical relationships.

Conclusion
Although the subject has received increasing attention in
recent years, phylogenetic investigations generally have
operated under the assumption that tree-building artifacts
are rare and restricted to odd and problematic taxa [51].
Implicit in phylogenomics is the assumption that the
dominant overall tree-building signal from large, multigene alignments overcomes "noise" or biases that lead to
conflicts between smaller data sets and, therefore, converges on true historical pattern. Indeed, this has been
argued explicitly with respect to increasing support for a
monophyletic Plantae as the number of genes included in
the analysis grows [21]. Given both theoretical and empirical criteria, this assumption appears overly optimistic.
Biochemically-based models of sequence evolution predict that historical patterns should not be recoverable in
phylogenetic analyses covering timescales on which the
broad diversity of eukaryotes emerged [65]. Moreover, it
has been demonstrated clearly that all phylogenetic algorithms can produce spurious outcomes when explicit or
implicit model assumptions are violated (see [51] for
thorough review); when violations result in statistical
inconsistency, artifacts worsen as data sets increase in size
[66,67]. Although parametric and probabilistic methods
(such as ML and Bayesian inference) overcome parsimony
artifacts under some conditions, they can actually underperform parsimony when variation among rates at sites
changes through time [68]. Presumably, complex patterns
of sequence heterotachy and nonstationary covariation
[39] have been the rule rather than exception over several
billion years of eukaryotic evolution.
Covariation of parallel or convergent selection on functional constraints in sequence evolution has not been
studied extensively, particularly with regard to its impact
on phylogenetic analyses. This is for good reason; such
covariation can be difficult to identify, even when the
sequences in question (as in the case for RPB1) have relatively well-characterized functions and biochemical interactions [37]. Little to nothing is known about the
functional interactions of most sequences used in phylogenomic investigations, nor can available phylogenetic
methodologies yet compensate for such complex covariation, even when physical and biochemical constraints are
known [39].
The indications of localized LBA and SBE uncovered in
this investigation are subtle; they would be easy to miss,
or to dismiss as too weak to affect tree topology. Neverthe-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/71

less, they provide the most reasonable explanation for the
aberrant grouping of glaucocystophyte and amoebozoan
sequences. They must, therefore, be considered seriously
with respect to other regions of the tree as well, including
those that agree with expectations from prior molecular
phylogenies. It is common in large phylogenomic treatments to remove overtly long-branch taxa to avoid treebuilding artifacts, or to constrain "well-defined" groupings (such as the Opisthokonta or Plantae) to make computation more tractable [21,40]. These practices may well
increase the impact of cryptic sources of covariation in the
sequences retained.
There are serious conflicts among molecular data sets with
respect to virtually all inferences about ancient eukaryotic
relationships (e.g. [69,70]). This is true even for the most
strongly supported and widely accepted hypotheses of
relationships among eukaryotic lineages [15,71,72]. The
overall lack of congruence of phylogenetic signal within
genomes has prompted some researchers to question
whether ancient relationships can be considered to be
tree-like at all [73]. When two or more phylogenetic signals are present, there appears to be no basis for an a priori
assumption that the dominant signal recovers historical
relationships. Instead it may reflect parallel function or
other constraints on sequence evolution that are difficult
to detect. As molecular sequence data sets grow ever larger
in size and complexity, it is critical that they be scrutinized
thoroughly for potential biases that could affect phylogenetic inference; in particular, sequences with relatively
slow apparent divergence rates should be examined carefully for evidence of short-branch exclusion. Finally, it is
essential that alternative approaches to reconstructing
evolutionary history continue to be explored.

Methods
Specimen preparation and nucleic acid extraction
An axenic culture of C. paradoxa (CCAC 0074) was
obtained from the Culture Collection of Algae (CCAC) at
the University of Cologne, Germany. Cells were grown in
bubbling cultures of soil water medium with barley seeds
(Carolina Biological, Burlington, NC) under constant fluorescent light at 25°C. Glaucocystis nostochinearum (UTEXB 1929)was obtained from UTEX culture collection (Austin, TX) and grown under the same conditions, but in
AlgaGro freshwater medium (Carolina Biological). Cells
were pelleted in a table-top centrifuge and stored at -80°C
for nucleic acid extraction.

Glaucocystis samples were placed in a chilled mortar, flash
frozen with liquid nitrogen, pulverized with a pestle to a
fine powder and suspended in an equal volume of nucleic
acid extraction buffer. Because Cyanophora lacks a cell
wall, no grinding was required. DNA extractions were performed using a CTAB extraction method [74], with an

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2005, 5:71

additional purification using Qiagen mini-columns
(Valencia CA). RNA was extracted with the Promega
(Madison, WI) SV Total RNA Isolation System.
Recovery of RPB1 sequences
GeneRacer RT-PCR (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was used to
obtain the RPB1 coding regions from total RNA extractions, using universal degenerate primers [5,75]. Primers
were used in nested pairs when necessary to amplify a
recoverable DNA band. Since degenerate primers were
involved, "touchdown" PCR was employed, with an
annealing temperature ramped from 58 to 43°C over 15
cycles, followed by 25 cycles annealing at 55°C. The 5'
end of the RPB1 transcript was obtained using RACE;
mRNA was dephosphorylated, de-capped and ligated to a
GeneRacer RNA oligo linker with nested priming sites,
permitting selective recovery of messages complete on the
5' end. Linker primers were used in opposition to nested
specific primers designed from sequences recovered previously using universal primers. To complete the 3' end of
the gene, an oligo dT linker was used in RT-PCR in opposition to sequence specific primers from region G. To
determine the number and position of introns, RPB1 was
isolated from genomic DNA by PCR using overlapping
sequence-specific primers based on cDNA sequences.

Bands amplified by standard and RT-PCR were cloned
using the TopoTA vector (Invitrogen) under blue-white
and kanamycin selection. White colonies were screened
via a PCR-stab technique described [75] with vector-specific primers. Plasmids were isolated from clones containing correct-sized inserts using QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit
(Qiagen), sequenced in complementary directions
through ABI Big-Dye technology (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA) and analyzed with Sequencher 4.0 (Gene
Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI).
Phylogenetic analyses
Inferred RPB1 amino acid sequences from Glaucocystis
[DQ223185] and Cyanophora [DQ223186] were aligned
with a data set of RPB1 sequences from organisms present
in GenBank and genome-sequencing databases (see Additional file 1). Sequences through the conserved H region
[30] were aligned with CLUSTAL X [76], and adjusted by
eye. Areas of the sequences with gaps that could not be
placed with confidence were excluded from the alignment. Two separate data sets were analyzed. One included
47 representatives from the broadest diversity of
sequences available; this alignment including a partial
sequence from Cyanophora (regions A-G). A second
smaller alignment, representing 30 taxa, was constructed
by removing sequences with large amounts of missing
data, as well as sequences demonstrated to produce phylogenetic artifacts in previous analyses.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/71

Maximum-likelihood parameters (amino acid frequencies, percent invariant sites, and α for modeling rate variation among sites) were estimated in TREEPUZZLE 5.0
[77] under a Jones-Taylor-Thornton (JTT [78]) substitution matrix with invariable + Γ (four category) distribution of rates. Maximum-likelihood trees were recovered in
ProtML (Phylip 3.6 [79]), using the parameters determined in TREEPUZZLE and 10 random sequence addition searches with global rearrangements. One hundred
likelihood bootstrap replicates were performed under a
JTT + uniform rate model, with 5 random sequence additions per replicate and global rearrangements.
Analyses were performed using MRBAYES 3.1 [80], with
the same parameters used with ML, to determine the consensus Bayesian tree and to assess strength of support for
tree nodes. Two simultaneous runs were performed, each
with four chains (one cold), for one million generations,
and trees were sampled every 100 generations. The "burnin" required to converge on stable likelihood values was
determined empirically, and trees sampled during the
burn-in were eliminated prior to computing the 50%
majority-rule consensus tree.
One thousand distance bootstrap replicates also were run
using in PROTDIST and NEIGHBOR (Phylip 3.6), with a
JTT substitution matrix. Parsimony bootstrap was carried
out in PAUP [81] with 1000 replicates and 20 random
sequence edition per replicate. Certain a priori phylogenetic hypotheses were examined with RPB1 data by implementing the Kishino-Hasegawa (KH), as well as the more
conservative Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH) tests [82,83] in
PROTML (Phylip 3.6).
Analyses of long-branch indicators
To assess the bases for the overall topology of the RPB1
tree, and specific differences between that topology and
trees recovered from other data sets, we analyzed "longbranch" tendencies of sequences in the 30 taxon data set.
We used three different methods, each independent of a
priori assumptions about relationships among distinct
eukaryotic lineages. 1) A χ2 test was performed in TREEPUZZLE to ascertain which sequences deviated significantly from average amino acid composition. 2) Unique
autapomorphies at otherwise highly conserved sites were
scored for all individual sequences, using MACCLADE
3.06 [84]. Unique substitutions were counted at sites that
were invariable in all but one or two sequences, that is,
sites clearly under strong stabilizing selection but still
capable of at least some change. If two changes were
present for a given character, they were scored only if unequivocally discrete substitutions; that is, each was a different residue or they occurred independently in taxa that
could not be related evolutionarily. 3) One hundred randomized sequences were constructed in MCCLADE 3.06,

composed of the average amino acid frequencies calculated in TREEPUZZLE. These sequences were added individually to the RPB1 alignment and used in parsimony
analyses with 20 random sequence additions to determine the empirical tendency of each RPB1 sequences to
attract "long-branches." Sequences were deemed to be
prone to long-branch artifacts if they attracted a random
sequence in 5% or more of parsimony replicates. These
sequences were removed from the alignment, and the
analyses repeated with three progressively smaller subsets
of RPB1 genes with decreasing apparent long-branch tendencies. With the smallest of these sub-alignments (five
taxa), 1000 bootstrap replicates were performed with each
of 10 random sequences (20 random additions each), to
determine the distribution of their points of attachment
when sequences with stronger "long-branch" tendencies
were removed.
