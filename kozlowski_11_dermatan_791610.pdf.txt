Abstract
Background: Previously, we have reported the presence of highly sulfated dermatans in solitary ascidians from the
orders Phlebobranchia (Phallusia nigra) and Stolidobranchia (Halocynthia pyriformis and Styela plicata). Despite the
identical disaccharide backbone, consisting of [®4IdoA(2S)b-1®3GalNAcb-1®], those polymers differ in the
position of sulfation on the N-Acetyl galactosamine, which can occur at carbon 4 or 6. We have shown that
position rather than degree of sulfation is important for heparin cofactor II activity. As a consequence, 2,4- and 2,6sulfated dermatans have high and low heparin cofactor II activities, respectively. In the present study we extended
the disaccharide analysis of ascidian dermatan sulfates to additional species of the orders Stolidobranchia
(Herdmania pallida, Halocynthia roretzi) and Phlebobranchia (Ciona intestinalis), aiming to investigate how sulfation
evolved within Tunicata. In addition, we analysed how heparin cofactor II activity responds to dermatan sulfates
containing different proportions of 2,6- or 2,4-disulfated units.
Results: Disaccharide analyses indicated a high content of disulfated disaccharide units in the dermatan sulfates
from both orders. However, the degree of sulfation decreased from Stolidobranchia to Phlebobranchia. While 76% of
the disaccharide units in dermatan sulfates from stolidobranch ascidians are disulfated, 53% of disulfated
disaccharides are found in dermatan sulfates from phlebobranch ascidians. Besides this notable difference in the
sulfation degree, dermatan sulfates from phlebobranch ascidians contain mainly 2,6-sulfated disaccharides whereas
dermatan sulfate from the stolidobranch ascidians contain mostly 2,4-sulfated disaccharides, suggesting that the
biosynthesis of dermatan sulfates might be differently regulated during tunicates evolution. Changes in the position
of sulfation on N-acetylgalactosamine in the disaccharide [®4IdoA(2-Sulfate)b-1®3GalNAcb-1®] modulate heparin
cofactor II activity of dermatan sulfate polymers. Thus, high and low heparin cofactor II stimulating activity is
observed in 2,4-sulfated dermatan sulfates and 2,6-sulfated dermatan sulfates, respectively, confirming the clear
correlation between the anticoagulant activities of dermatan sulfates and the presence of 2,4-sulfated units.
Conclusions: Our results indicate that in ascidian dermatan sulfates the position of sulfation on the GalNAc in the
disaccharide [®4IdoA(2S)b-1®3GalNAcb-1®] is directly related to the taxon and that the 6-O sulfation is a novelty
apparently restricted to the Phlebobranchia. We also show that the increased content of [®4IdoA(2S)b-1®3GalNAc
(4S)b-1®] disaccharide units in dermatan sulfates from Stolidobranchia accounts for the increased heparin cofactor
II stimulating activity.

Background
Dermatan sulfate (DS) is a heterogeneous glycosaminoglycan (GAG), formed by repeating disaccharide units consisting of 4-linked glucuronic acid, 1,3-linked N-acetyl
galactosamine ([®4GlcAb-1®3GalNAcb-1®]). The
extensive heterogeneity of the polymer results from variation in the degree of epimerization on carbon 5 of glucuronic acid, O-sulfation on carbon 4 or 6 of N-Acetyl
galactosamine (GalNAc) and on carbon 2 of iduronic acid
(IdoA) [1]. It has been shown that regions enriched in
[®4IdoA(2S)b-1®3GalNAc(4S)b-1®] units in DS bind to
heparin cofactor II (HCII) (2S and 4S represent 2-O- and
4-O-sulfate, respectively), enhancing the HCII-induced
inhibition of thrombin [2,3].
Previously, we reported the presence of highly sulfated
DSs in solitary ascidians from orders Phlebobranchia
(Phallusia nigra) and Stolidobranchia (Halocynthia pyriformis and Styela plicata) [4-6]. These polymers are composed by the same disaccharide backbone, consisting of
[®4IdoA(2S)b-1®3GalNAcb-1®], but differ in the position of sulfation on GalNAc, which can be sulfated
at carbon 4 or 6 [7]. The DS from the stolidobranchs H.pyriformis and S.plicata are sulfated at carbon 2 of IdoA
and carbon 4 of GalNAc [6] and are potent activators of
HCII. On the other hand, the DS from the phlebobranch
P.nigra is sulfated at carbon 2 of IdoAc and at carbon 6
of GalNAc, and is a poor activator of HCII [5].
Ascidians (sea-squirts) are an ancient life form with fossils dating back to the Early Cambrian [8,9]. They belong
to the phylum Chordata, subphylum Tunicata (Urochordata). Because of their basal position on the chordate phylogeny, ascidians are key to understanding chordate
evolution and the origin of vertebrates [10-13]. The traditional classification of the Ascidiacea includes three orders:
Aplousobranchia, Stolidobranchia and Phlebobranchia.
This traditional view has been disputed by many recent
reconstructions of their evolution, gathering evidence of
the paraphyly of Ascidiacea, although confirming the
monophyly of Tunicata [14]. While all ascidian orders
include colonial forms, solitary species are only present in
Stolidobranchia and Phlebobranchia [15].
The study of ascidians has demonstrated several ways
in which these organisms can inform us about our own
development and evolution. To increase our understanding about how DS sulfation evolved in chordates, we analyzed the disaccharide composition of DSs obtained from
two species of stolidobranch (Herdmania pallida and
Halocynthia roretzi), and one species of phlebobranch
ascidians (Ciona intestinalis). The results were further
compared with our previous data on DSs from other ascidians of the same orders. In addition, we investigated the
ability of the ascidian DSs to potentiate HCII. Our results
indicate that in ascidians the position of sulfation on the

Page 2 of 9

GalNAc in the disaccharide [®4IdoA(2S)b-1®3GalNAcb-1®] is directly related to the taxon and that the
6-O sulfation is a novelty apparently restricted to the
Phlebobranchia. We also show that the presence of
[®4IdoA(2S)b-1®3GalNAc(4S)b-1®] disaccharide units
in DSs from stolidobranch ascidians accounts for their
increased HCII-stimulating activity.

Results
Analysis of the GAGs from H. pallida and C. intestinalis

A qualitative analysis of the sulfated GAGs extracted from
Herdmania pallida and Ciona intestinalis was carried out
by agarose gel electrophoresis, before or after degradation
of the glycans with specific GAG-lyases or deaminative
cleavage with nitrous acid. Several metachromatic bands
with different electrophoretic motilities were observed in
the gel of the total GAGs extracted from each ascidian
species (Figure 1A and 1B, line 1). With the exception of
the very low mobility metachromatic band present

Figure 1 Isolation of total polysaccharides from H. pallida (A)
and C. intestinalis (B). A and B, the polysaccharides extracted from
ascidians (~15 mg) before (-) and after (+) incubation with
chondroitin AC or ABC lyases and treatment with nitrous acid, were
applied to a 0.5% agarose gel and run for 1 h at 100 V in 0.05 M
1,3-diaminopropane/acetate (pH 9.0). The polysaccharides in the gel
were fixed with 0.1% N-cetyl-N,N,N-trimethylammonium bromide
solution. After 12 h, the gel was dried and stained with 0.1%
toluidine blue in acetic acid/ethanol/water (0.1:5:5, v/v). As a
standard, a mixture of mammalian glycosaminoglycans containing
10 mg of each chondroitin 4-sulfate (CS), dermatan sulfate (DS) and
heparin (Hep) was applied in agarose gel.

exclusively in the gel of C. intestinalis, which resists all
GAG-degrading enzymes and nitrous acid treatment
(Figure 1B), all other bands in the gel of H. pallida and
C. intestinalis disappear after incubation with a specific
GAG-degrading enzyme or deaminative cleavage with
nitrous acid. Thus, the metachromatic band migrating
slightly under that of standard heparan sulfate (HS) in the
gels of both H. pallida and C. intestinalis (Figure 1A and
1B, line 2) disappears after nitrous acid treatment. The
band migrating as standard chondroitin sulfate (CS),
which is stronger in the gel of H. pallida, disappears after
incubation with chondroitinase AC (Figure 1A, line 3). In
line 4, chondroitinase ABC treatment degrades the top
part of the band migrating as HS in figure 1A, and the
band migrating at the same position as standard dermatan
sulfate (DS) in figure 1B. Overall, these results point to the
presence of CS, DS and HS in the ascidians H. pallida and
C. intestinalis, occurring at different proportions, as differences in band densities indicate. In addition, an unidentified glycan, corresponding to the very low mobility band
in Figure 1B is also present in C. intestinalis.
Fractionation of H. pallida and C. intestinalis GAGs

Total GAGs from H. pallida and C. intestinalis were
applied to an ion-exchange column and eluted with
increasing NaCl concentration (Figure 2). Two main metachromatic peaks eluted from the column with 1.2 M and
1.6 M NaCl and were named P1.2 and P1.6, respectively
(Figure 2A and 2B). A significant metachromatic shoulder,
eluting with 0.9 M NaCl at the 1.2 M-peak of the total
GAGs from C. intestinalis is also observed (Figure 2B).
Qualitative analysis by agarose gel electrophoresis of the
peaks eluted from the column before or after (not shown)
enzymatic or nitrous acid treatment indicated that P1.2
contains mainly HS (low-mobility band) and CS (highmotility band), whereas P1.6 is composed exclusively of
DS. P0.9 is probably the non-GAG sulfated polysaccharide
mentioned earlier, since it resists incubation with chondroitinase AC and ABC, keratanase and deaminative cleavage with nitrous acid.
Characterization of the purified DSs from the ascidians by
agarose and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis

The purified ascidian DSs were analyzed by two different electrophoretic systems: agarose gel in diaminopropane buffer, where the electrophoretic motilities of the
GAGs is related to their structural characteristic; and
polyacrylamide gel in barbital buffer, where the molecules are separated according to their molecular weight.
The DSs from H. pallida and C. intestinalis were analyzed along with that from Halocynthia roretzi, which
was purified as described in the Methods section,
and those from S. plicata and P. nigra, that were purified as described [5,6]. As shown in figure 3A, the

pallida (A and B) and C. intestinalis (C and D) on a Mono QFPLC column. A and C, the total polysaccharides extracted from
ascidians were applied to a Mono Q-FPLC column and purified as
described under “Materials and methods”. Fractions were assayed by
metachromasia (•), and NaCl concentration (- - -). The fractions
indicated by horizontal bars were pooled in peaks, denominated P1
and P2 (A) or P1, P2 and P3 (C), dialyzed against distilled water and
lyophilized. The vertical arrows indicate the elution of standard
mammalian dermatan sulfate (DS) and heparin on Mono Q-FPLC
column. B and D, ~15 mg of each peak from Mono Q-FPLC column
were applied to a 0.5% agarose gel and run for 1 h at 100 V in 0.05
M 1,3-diaminopropane/acetate (pH 9.0). The polysaccharides in the
gel were fixed with 0.1% N-cetyl-N,N,N-trimethylammonium
bromide solution. After 12 h, the gel was dried and stained with
0.1% toluidine blue in acetic acid/ethanol/water (0.1:5:5, v/v). As a
standard, a mixture of mammalian glycosaminoglycans containing
10 mg each of chondroitin 4-sulfate (CS), dermatan sulfate (DS) and
heparin (Hep) was applied in agarose gel.

electrophoretic motilities of the DSs from the stolidobranchs S. plicata, H. pallida and H. roretzi were very
similar, migrating between DS and HS standards. These
motilities differ from those of the DSs from the phlebobranchs P. nigra and C. intestinalis that migrate higher
in the gel, similar to that of DS standard.
Analysis of the ascidian DS by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in barbital buffer, revealed that there is not a similar electrophoretic mobility pattern among the DS from
different species of the same ascidian order (Figure 3B).
The DSs from species of the orders Stolidobranchia and
Phlebobranchia differ in molecular weight as well as in
polydispersity. The DSs from S. plicata and P. nigra have
the lowest average molecular weight (~30 KDa). On the
other hand, the DS from H. roretzi has the highest average
molecular weight (~50 KDa), whereas the DSs from the
H. pallida and C. intestinalis have an intermediate average

Disaccharide composition of the ascidian DSs

Figure 3 Agarose and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of
ascidians and mammalian dermatan sulfate. A, purified
dermatan sulfate (~15 mg) from S. plicata, H. pallida, P. nigra or
C. intestinalis were applied to a 0.5% agarose gel and run for 1 h at
100 V in 0.05 M 1,3-diaminopropane/acetate (pH 9.0).
Glycosaminoglycans were fixed with 0.1% N-cetyl-N,N,Ntrimethylammonium bromide solution. After 12 h, the gel was dried
and stained with 0.1% toluidine blue in acetic acid/ethanol/water
(0.1:5:5, v/v). To a standard, a mixture of mammalian
glycosaminoglycans containing 10 mg each of chondroitin 4-sulfate
(CS), dermatan sulfate (DS) and heparin (Hep) were applied in
agarose gel. B, purified dermatan sulfate (~15 mg) from S. plicata,
H. pallida, P. nigra or C. intestinalis were applied to 6% 1-mm-thick
polyacrylamide gel slab in 0.02 M sodium barbital (pH 8.6) and run
for 30 min at 100 V. After electrophoresis the dermatan sulfates
were stained with 0.1% toluidine blue in 1% acetic acid and then
washed for about 4 h in 1% acetic acid. The molecular mass (M.W.)
markers were high molecular mass dextran sulfate (S1, ~500 kDa),
chondroitin 6-sulfate (S2, ~54 kDa), chondroitin 4-sulfate (S3,
~36 kDa) and low molecular mass dextran sulfate (S4, ~8 kDa).

molecular weight (~45 KDa). The DS from S. plicata and P.
nigra have high molecular weight and are very polydisperse,
similar to what is observed for porcine skin DS. It is interesting to notice that differences in molecular weight do not
influence the mobility of the DSs in the agarose gel
electrophoresis.

The purified DSs from H. pallida, H. roretzi and
C. intestinalis were exhaustively degraded with chondroitinase ABC. The disaccharides formed (>95%) were
separated by gel filtration chromatography, as described
in material and methods and analyzed on a strong
anion-exchange HPLC.
The disaccharides formed by the action of chondroitinase ABC are shown in Figure 4 and in Table 1. The
method used allowed the separation of the following
standard disaccharides: ΔUA-GalNAc, ΔUA(2S)-GalNAc,
ΔUA-GalNAc(6S), ΔUA-GalNAc(4S), ΔUA(2S)-GalNAc
(6S), and ΔUA(2S)-GalNAc(4S) (6S represents 6-O-sulfate). The disaccharide composition of the DSs from the
stolidobranchs H. pallida and H. roretzi are very similar
and homogeneous, showing the typical disaccharides
detected in the DSs from other species of this order
(S. plicata and H. pyriformis) (Table 1). They consist of
about 80% and 20% of the disaccharides ΔUA(2S)-GalNAc(4S) and ΔUA-GalNAc(4S), respectively. Minor
amounts of the disaccharides ΔUA-GalNAc, ΔUA(2S)GalNAc and ΔUA(2S)-GalNAc(6S) are also present
(Figure 4 and Table 1).
The DS from the phlebobranch C. intestinalis has a
more heterogeneous disaccharide composition, when
compared with the DSs from stolidobranch species
(Figure 4 and Table 1). Whereas disulfated disaccharides
prevail in Stolidobranchia DSs, accounting for at least
70% of the polymers, mono-sulfated disaccharides are
the major units in the DS from C. intestinalis, corresponding to about 55% of the composition. These units
are sulfated at either carbon 4 or carbon 6 of the galactosamine, while the mono-sulfated disaccharides in stolidobranch DSs are mainly sulfated at carbon 4 of the
galactosamine (Table 1). The main disulfated disaccharide in Phlebobranchia DSs is the ΔUA(2S)-GalNAc(6S),
accounting for 36% and 77% in C. intestinalis and
P. nigra DSs, respectively. The DSs from Phlebobranchia
ascidians differ in that the 4-sulfated galactosamine
units are present in C. intestinalis and absent in
P. nigra.
Sulfation pattern of ascidians DSs and HCII activity

Figure 5 A shows a direct measurement of the inhibition
of thrombin by heparin cofactor II in the presence of the
different ascidians DSs. The IC50 for thrombin inhibition
is 0.27, 0.28 and 43.54 μg/ml for the H. pallida, H. roretzi
and C. intestinalis DSs, respectively (Figure 5A and 5B).
Figure 5B, shows the percentage of 2,4-Di-sulfated units in
the DSs from the different ascidian species, their correspondent IC50 for thrombin inhibition by HCII, and aPTT
values. The HCII activity of the ascidians DS, which is estimated by the IC50 (the lower IC50 the higher HCII activity), increases with the augment of 2,4-Di-sulfated units

Kozlowski et al. BMC Biochemistry 2011, 12:29

2,4-Di-sulfated units and the higher HCII activity, whereas
the opposite is observed for the DSs from Phlebobranchia
species.
As shown in Figure 5B, the compositional differences
and HCII inhibition activity of most DSs correlates with
variations in aPPT values. Thus, higher proportion of
2,4-disulfated units correlates with higher aPTT values.

Figure 4 Strong anion-exchange HPLC analysis of the
disaccharides formed by chondroitin ABC lyase digestion of
ascidians dermatan sulfate. A mixture of standards disaccharide
(A) and disaccharides formed by exhaustive action of chondroitin
ABC lyase on dermatan sulfate from Herdmania pallida (B) and C.
intestinalis (C) were applied to a 25-cm × 4.6-mm Spherisorb-SAX
column, linked to an HPLC system. The column was eluted with a
gradient of NaCl as described under “Materials and methods”. The
eluant was monitored for UV absorbance at 232 nm. The numbered
peaks correspond to elution positions of know disaccharide
standards: peak 1, ΔHexUA-GalNAc; peak 2, ΔHexUA-GalNAc(6S);
peak 3, ΔHexUA-GalNAc(4S); peak 4, ΔHexUA(2S)-GalNAc(6S); peak 5,
ΔHexUA-GalNAc(4S, 6S); peak 6, ΔHexUA(2S)-GalNAc(4S); peak 7,
ΔHexUA(2S)-GalNAc(4S, 6S).

(Figure 5B and 5C). Therefore, H. pallida DS, which contains ~81% of 2,4-Di-sulfated units has the higher HCII
activity, whereas P. nigra DS, with 0% of 2,4-Di-sulfated
units has the lowest HCII activity. Interestingly, the DSs
from Stolidobranchia ascidians have the highest content of

Discussion
The subphylum Tunicata comprises the ascidians and
two other taxa, Appendicularia and Thaliacea. Tunicates
are proposed in some phylogenies as the closest living
relatives of the vertebrates [10,11], although most of the
recent reconstructions still place the Cephalochordata as
the sister group of the back-boned animals [12-14].
In order to study how sulfation of DS evolved in tunicates we compared the disaccharide composition of DS
polymers obtained from ascidians of two different orders:
Stolidobranchia and Phlebobranchia. The disaccharide
analysis indicated a high content of disulfated disaccharide
units in the DSs from both taxa. Interestingly, the degree
of DS sulfation decreased on Phlebobranchia clade. Thus,
76% of the disaccharide units in the DSs from stolidobranch ascidians are disulfated, compared to 53% in the
DSs from the phlebobranch. In fact, the two taxa probably
diverged early during the evolution of tunicates. Phlebobranch ascidians have a simpler pharynx, without the folds
present in the stolidobranch. Additionally, the phlebobranch blood contains usually vanadium, while stolidobranch has iron instead [16]. Other important distinctions
are present in terms of the development of the atrial cavity
and position of the gonads [15]. Also, the aforementioned
recent hypotheses about the evolution of the tunicates
place the thaliaceans within the Phlebobranchia. Therefore, the study of the DS composition of thaliaceans will
be relevant to understand the evolutionary history of the
group.
The sulfation pattern of the tunicate DS disaccharides
showed interesting results, pointing to an evident structural
difference: DS from phlebobranch ascidians contain mainly
2,6-sulfated disaccharides, whereas DSs from stolidobranch
ascidians contain mostly 2,4-sulfated disaccharides.
Although information about sulfation pattern in DS from
other Deuterostomia is scanty, both types of sulfation are
found in vertebrates. While 2,4-sulfated disaccharides are
commonly found in extracellular DS proteoglycans, such
as decorin and biglycan present in different tissues as tendon, cartilage or skin [17], significant yet small proportions
(5%) of 2,6-sulfated units have been found in mouse or pig
brain [18,19] and the biosynthetic regulation of the expression of 2,6-sulfated disaccharides by 6-O-sulfotransferases,
2-O-sulfotransferase and C5-epimerase might play critical
roles in the development of the hippocampus and cerebellum [4]. Considering those data, our results point to the

2,4-sulfation as a conserved feature along Chordata and the
predominance of 2,6-sulfated disaccharides as the derived
condition. Further investigation on the DS structure of
echinoderms and hemichordates should clarify this issue.
In vertebrate chordates, four groups of sulfotransferases are involved in the modification of CS/DS: (1)
DS-specific 4-O-sulfotransferase; (2) chondroitin 6-Osulfotransferase; (3) uronyl 2-O-sulfotransferase; (4) GalNAc-4-sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase. Interestingly, a comprehensive survey of sulfotransferases in the ascidian C.
intestinalis showed similarity to vertebrate CS/DS-specific sulfotransferases. From eight C.intestinalis proteins
found to be closely related to DS/CS 4-O-sulfotransferases, four were proposed to have arisen by duplication during the evolution of tunicates. Although eight
genes encoding C6ST-like proteins were also found in
C. intestinalis genome, their evolutionary history was
not clear. It was suggested that divergence of the C6ST
family genes has occurred independently during the evolution of tunicate, cephalochordate and vertebrate
lineages [20]. C. intestinalis genome presented also four
genes encoding urosyl 2-O-sulfotransferases, one of
them very closely related to human 2-O-sulfotransferases. However, a GalNAc-4-sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase homologous gene was not found in C. intestinalis
genome. In fact, no 4,6-sulfated disaccharides were
found in DSs from C. intestinalis or other ascidians analyzed in the present work, despite the high content of 4O-sulfated N-acetylgalactosamine in stolidobranch ascidians and the presence of these units also in C. intestinalis. On the other hand, albeit up 90% of disaccharide
units in DS from P. nigra contains 6-O-sulfated N-acetylgalactosamine, no 4-O-sulfated units were found.
The differences in the sulfation patterns from C. intestinalis and P. nigra may also result from divergent evolution, as these species are not closely related within the
Phlebobranchia. Our results on the structure of DSs
from ascidians add to Tetsukawa’s results, suggesting

different mechanisms for GAG sulfation according to
taxa, which may have been emerged via gene duplication, occurring independently in each group and leading
to different types of 4-O-sulfotransferases and 6-O-sulfotransferases in ascidians and vertebrates, with distinct
substrate specificities.
The high affinity binding of DS to HCII requires a rare
sequence consisting of [IdoA(2S)-GalNA(4S)]3 [3]. Interestingly, DS with higher sulfation levels bind poorly to
HCII, suggesting significant specificity of interaction
[6,21]. Corroborating with this idea, recent work has
shown that a specific geometry of the [IdoA(2S)-GalNA
(4S)]-hexasaccharide, which forms a 2 1 -helix topology
(21-°S2.1C4.1C4), is required for high affinity binding to
HCII [22]. This geometry allows the interaction of the
[IdoA(2S)-GalNA(4S)]-hexasaccharide with key aminoacids involved in the binding to HCII and the correct
orientation for the binding to exocite II of thrombin.
Extention of the high-affinity sequence in DS polymers is
expected to increase the binding and the activity of HCII
[22].
In the present, work we observed that ascidian DSs
with increasing content of 2,4-sulfated disaccharides
showed increasing HCII activity, (Figure 5A-B). Therefore, in consonance with the previous paragraphy, it is
possible to suggest that in the HCII-active DSs, [IdoA
(2S)-GalNA(4S)]-disaccharides are clustered in 21-helix
topology (21-°S2.1C4.1C4) sequences with inceasing lengh.
Finally, an interesting characteristic of ascidians is
their ability to rapid vessel regeneration [23]. Such
event, taken together with the fact that in vertebrates
DS have been demonstrated to be involved in wound
repair, raises intriguing questions concerning the molecular mechanisms underlying angiogenesis. Is the presence of oversulfated DS in ascidians related to fast
vessel regeneration by binding to growth factors?
Furthermore, the drastic difference between the DS
disaccharide units from phlebobranch and stolidobranch

less internal vessels. On the other hand, stolidobranch
ascidians have a more complex structure, with a folded
pharynx and a larger number of internal vessels. The DS
structural differences from both ascidian orders could be
related to the pharynx vascular organization.
Notably the evolution of glycosaminoglycans in animals including invertebrates as well as vertebrates has
also recently been reviewed in terms of their structure
and biological activities [24].

Conclusions
Our results indicate that in ascidians the position of sulfation on the GalNAc in the disaccharide [®4IdoA(2S)
b-1®3GalNAcb-1®] is directly related to the taxon and
that the 6-O sulfation is a novelty apparently restricted
to the Phlebobranchia. We also show that an increase in
the content of [®4IdoA(2S)b-1®3GalNAc(4S)b-1®]
disaccharide units in DS accounts for an increased
HCII-stimulating activity.
Methods
Isolation of ascidian DSs

Figure 5 Direct measurement of the inhibition of thrombin by
heparin cofactor II in the presence of the different ascidian
DSs. A, inhibition of thrombin activity by HCII in the presence of
DSs from H. pallida (- l -), H. roretzi (- l -), and C. intestinalis (- ν -).
HCII (68 nM) was incubated with thrombin (15 nM) in the presence
of various concentrations of glycans. After 60 seconds, the
remaining thrombin or factor Xa activity was determined with a
chromogenic substrate (ΔA405/min). The results are expressed as %
of thrombin activity. B, IC50 (mg/ml) values for thrombin inhibition
by HCII in the presence of DSs containing different percentages of
2,4-Disulfated disaccharide units (ΔDi2,4S) obtained from the
ascidians H. pallida (- l -), H. roretzi (- l -), H. pyriformis (- ○ -),
S. plicata (- ν -), Porcine intestinal mucosa (PIM) (- s -), C. intestinalis
(- ν -) and P. nigra (- □ -).

The ascidians H. pallida and P. nigra were collected in
Angra dos Reis, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; S. plicata was collected at Praia da Urca, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; C. intestinalis was obtained from the Marine Biological Laboratory,
Woods Hole, Massacchussets, USA; H. roretzi was
obtained from the Japanese company (Maruha Nichiro
Holdings, Inc., Tokyo). To extract the glycans, the animals
had the tunic removed and were maintained in acetone at
room temperature overnight. Tissues were dried at 60°C,
homogenized, suspended in twenty-volumes of digestion
buffer (50 mM sodium acetate, 5 mM EDTA, 10 mM
cysteine, pH 5.0), containing 10% papain (w/w), and incubated at 60°C, overnight. Soluble glycans were precipitated
with two-volumes of ethanol and fractionated in an anion
exchange chromatography on a Mono-Q-FPLC column
(HR 5/5) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), equilibrated in
20 mM Tris/HCl (pH 8.8), containing 4 mM EDTA. The
column was developed with a linear gradient of 0-2.0 M
NaCl in the same buffer, at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The
fractions from the column were monitored by metachromatic property with dimethylmethylene blue, at 525 nm
[25]. The metachromatic fractions were pooled, dialyzed,
lyophilized and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis.
Agarose gel electrophoresis

ascidians may also be related to an angiogenesis event.
The alteration between a 2,4 disaccharide from Stolidobranchia to a 2,6 disaccharide in Phlebobranchia might
be involved in the branchial vessel organization. One of
the main differences between these two ascidian orders
is the pharyngeal structure. Phlebobranch ascidians possess a simpler pharynx, without folds and usually with

The ascidian glycans were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, as described [5]. Briefly, GAGs (~15 mg)
were applied to a 0.5% agarose gel and ran for 1 h at
100 V in 0.05 M 1,3-diaminopropane/acetate (pH 9.0).
GAGs were fixed in the gel with 0.1% N-cetyl-N,N,Ntrimethylammonium bromide solution. After 12 h the

Kozlowski et al. BMC Biochemistry 2011, 12:29
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/12/29

gel was dried and stained with 0.1% toluidine blue in
acetic acid/ethanol/water (0.1:5:5, v/v).
Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-The molecular
weight of the ascidian DSs was estimated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. DS samples (~10 mg) were
applied to a 7.5% 1-mm-thick polyacrylamide gel slab in
0.02 M sodium barbital (pH 8.6). After electrophoresis
(100 V for 30 min), the gel was stained with 0.1% toluidine blue in 1% acetic acid and then washed for about 4
h in 1% acetic acid. The molecular weight markers were
the same as those used previously [26].
Enzymatic treatments with chondroitin lyases

The glycans extracted from ascidians (~20 mg) were
incubated with 0.005 U of chondroitin AC or ABC
lyases, as described previously [6]. Intact and enzymedegraded glycans were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, as described earlier.
Deaminative cleavage with nitrous acid - deaminative
cleavage was performed by nitrous acid at pH 1.5, as
described [27]. Briefly, total glycans extracted from ascidians tissues (~20 μg) were incubated with 5 μL of fresh
generated HNO2 at room temperature for 90 min. The
reaction mixtures were then neutralized with 1.0 M
Na2CO3. Intact and nitrous acid-degraded glycans were
analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis.
Analysis of the disaccharides formed by digestion of the
dermatan sulfate with chondroitin ABC lyase

The purified DSs from the ascidians were exhaustively
degraded with chondroitin ABC lyase, as described earlier.
The disaccharides formed were recovered by Superdex 75
(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which was connected to a
HPLC system from Shimadzu (Tokyo, Japan). The column
was equilibrated with an aqueous solution of 20% acetonitrile (pH 3.5) and developed at a flow rate of 0.25 mL/min.
Fractions of 0.5 mL were collected and checked for absorbance at 232 nm. Fractions containing disaccharides were
pooled, freeze-dried and analyzed by strong anionexchange chromatography on a 25-cm Spherisorb-SAX
column (Sigma-Aldrich), linked to a HPLC system. The
column was developed with a linear gradient of 0 - 1.0 M
aqueous NaCl (pH 3.5) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The
elution of the disaccharides was followed by absorbance at
232 nm, and identified by comparison with the elution
positions of standard disaccharides.
Hexuronic acid determination

The content of DS was estimated measuring hexuronic
acid in the purified samples by the carbazole reaction [28].
Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) assay

aPTT clotting assays were carried out as described previously [6]. Briefly, normal human plasma (90 μL) was

incubated with 10 μL of DS at several dilutions and 100
μL of cephalin. After three minutes at 37°C, 100 μL of
0.25 M CaCl2 were added to the mixtures and the clotting time was recorded. The activity was expressed
as units/mg using a standard unfractionated heparin
(180 U/mg) curve.
Heparin cofactor II-mediated inhibition of thrombin by
ascidian DSs

The inhibitory activity of ascidian DSs was measured in
96-well plate. Briefly, 30 μL of 68 nM HCII in 0.02 M
Tris-HCl, pH 7.4/0.15 M NaCl/PEG 1 mg/mL were incubated with 30 μL of ascidian DSs at different concentrations. After incubating for 2 minutes, 10 μL of 50 μM
thrombin was added. Thrombin activity was measured
using a synthetic chromogenic substrate (S-2238 from
DiaPharma Group). The HCII-mediated thrombin inhibition in presence of DSs was expressed as the percentage of
thrombin activity during 9 minutes. All DSs were assayed
twice in triplicate and expressed as the mean ± the standard deviation.
