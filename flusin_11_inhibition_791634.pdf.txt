small interfering RNAs and their combination
with ribavirin

Abstract
Background: The genus Nairovirus in the family Bunyaviridae contains 34 tick-borne viruses classified into seven
serogroups. Hazara virus (HAZV) belongs to the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) serogroup that also
includes CCHF virus (CCHFV) a major pathogen for humans. HAZV is an interesting model to study CCHFV due to a
close serological and phylogenetical relationship and a classification which allows handling in a BSL2 laboratory.
Nairoviruses are characterized by a tripartite negative-sense single stranded RNA genome (named L, M and S
segments) that encode the RNA polymerase, the Gn-Gc glycoproteins and the nucleoprotein (NP), respectively.
Currently, there are neither vaccines nor effective therapies for the treatment of any bunyavirus infection in
humans. In this study we report, for the first time, the use of RNA interference (RNAi) as an approach to inhibit
nairovirus replication.
Results: Chemically synthesized siRNAs were designed to target the mRNA produced by the three genomic
segments. We first demonstrated that the siRNAs targeting the NP mRNA displayed a stronger antiviral effect than
those complementary to the L and M transcripts in A549 cells. We further characterized the two most efficient
siRNAs showing, that the induced inhibition is specific and associated with a decrease in NP synthesis during HAZV
infection. Furthermore, both siRNAs depicted an antiviral activity when used before and after HAZV infection. We
next showed that HAZV was sensitive to ribavirin which is also known to inhibit CCHFV. Finally, we demonstrated
the additive or synergistic antiviral effect of siRNAs used in combination with ribavirin.
Conclusions: Our study highlights the interest of using RNAi (alone or in combination with ribavirin) to treat
nairovirus infection. This approach has to be considered for the development of future antiviral compounds
targeting CCHFV, the most pathogenic nairovirus.

Background
Hazara virus (HAZV) is a member of the genus Nairovirus of the family Bunyaviridae which also includes
Orthobunyavirus, Hantavirus, Phlebovirus and Tospovirus. Nairovirus comprises 34 tick-borne viruses classified into seven serogroups. The main representative
serogroups are the Nairobi sheep disease group containing Nairobi sheep disease virus (NSDV) and Dugbe
virus and the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever
(CCHF) group including HAZV and Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) [1,2]. While NSDV

induces acute hemorrhagic gastroenteritis in sheep and
goats, CCHFV is responsible of severe hemorrhagic
fever in humans associated with elevated levels of mortality (up to 50%) [1,3]. Due to its high pathogenicity for
humans and because of the lack of therapeutics,
CCHFV must be handled in BSL4 (biosafety level 4)
laboratory [1]. Widely distributed throughout Eastern
Europe, Asia and Africa, CCHFV represents a major
public health problem [4,5] and is now considered as an
emerging disease [6,7]. HAZV was isolated for the first
time in 1954 from Ixodes ticks collected in Pakistan
[8-10]. Although its natural host is not known, antibodies against HAZV were detected in rodent sera [11].
While non pathogenic for humans, it is lethal in newborn mice [12] and elicits cross-protection against

CCHFV challenge in adult mice [13]. HAZV represents
an alternative model to study CCHFV due to its close
serological and phylogenetical relationship [13]. Furthermore, it can be handled in BSL2 laboratories.
The nairovirus are spherical enveloped particles of 100
nm in diameter. Their genome consists of three segments
of single-stranded RNA of negative polarity designated S
(Small), M (Medium) and L (Large) RNA segments.
These three segments encode the nucleocapsid protein
(NP), the envelope glycoproteins (Gn and Gc) and an
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L), respectively
[2,14,15]. During the viral cycle, NP and L drive the processes of transcription (mRNA synthesis) and replication
(synthesis of genomic RNA) that occur in the cytoplasm
[2]. Thus, targeting these proteins is likely an accurate
strategy to inhibit the viral replication.
Currently, there are neither vaccines nor effective
therapies to treat bunyavirus infection in humans. Ribavirin, however, has been shown to inhibit CCHFV replication in Vero cells [16], reducing the mean time to
death in infant mice [17] and partially protecting
infected STAT-1 KO mice [18]. Several studies reported
the efficiency of oral or intravenous use of ribavirin to
treat CCHFV infection cases [19-21] but to date, no
double-blind trial had been carried out. Therefore, it is
important to initiate research programs aimed towards
the development of new medical countermeasures
against CCHFV.
Since its discovery in 1998 [22], RNA interference
(RNAi) has been successfully applied as a technology to
inhibit gene expression. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), the mediators of RNAi, are a class of doublestranded RNA molecules (20-25 nucleotides in length)
that interfere with translation by inducing sequence-specific degradation of homologous mRNA [23,24]. Recently,
several RNAi-based applications for gene silencing have
been developed to target pathogenic human viruses causing acute or chronic infections including HIV-1 [25,26],
influenza virus [27,28], respiratory syncytial virus [29,30],
hepatitis B [31-34] and C viruses [35-37], as well as Marburg and Ebola filoviruses [38-40].
In this report, we tested various chemically synthesized siRNAs for their ability to inhibit HAZV replication in cell culture. We demonstrated that siRNAs
targeting the NP mRNA depicted a stronger antiviral
effect than those designed to inhibit the L and M segment encoded mRNAs. siRNAs were efficient when
transfected in cells before or after HAZV infection and
their use in combination with ribavirin induced a synergistic or an additive antiviral effect, according to the
dose of ribavirin used. Thus, our study highlights the
potential of RNAi in the antiviral treatment of nairovirus infection.

Methods
Cell lines and viruses

A549 cells (human lung carcinoma cell line, ATCC CCL185) and Vero E6 cells (African green monkey kidney,
ATCC CRL-1586) were grown in F12K medium and Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium DMEM (Gibco, Invitrogen Corporation, Paisley, United Kingdom), respectively,
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum
(FCS; Invitrogen, Sao Paulo, Brazil) and maintained at
37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. BHK21 cells (baby hamster kidney, ATCC CCL10) were cultured in Glasgow
minimum essential medium GMEM (Gibco, Invitrogen
Corporation) with 10% FCS, 10% tryptose phosphate
(Sigma-Aldrich, St Quentin-Fallavier, France) and
50 mM HEPES (Gibco, Invitrogen Corporation) at 37°C
in a 5% CO2 atmosphere.
The HAZV strain JC280 used in these experiments
was produced by infecting 90% confluent BHK21 cells at
a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001. Virus was
titrated using a focus-forming assay in Vero E6 cells as
described below. Viral stocks usually reached 106-107
foci forming units per ml (ffu/ml).
HAZV titration

Monolayers of Vero E6 cultured in 12-well microplates
were infected with serial 10-fold dilutions of supernatant
from infected cells. After 1 hr incubation at 37°C, 3.2%
carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) sodium salt (VWR International Ltd, Poole, England) were added into each well.
CMC overlay was removed five days post-infection and
cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 20 min at
room temperature (RT) and permeabilized in 0.5% Triton
X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, St Quentin-Fallavier, France) for
5 min. Viral foci were detected by probing with mouse
anti-HAZV hyperimmune ascitic fluid (1:2000) for 1 hr
at 37°C, followed by horseradish peroxydase-conjugated
goat anti-mouse IgG (1:2000, Interchim, Montluçon,
France) at 37°C for 1 hr. The cell monolayer was then
incubated with 0.7 mg/ml of 3,3’-diaminobenzidine
(DAB) solution (Sigma-Aldrich, St Quentin-Fallavier,
France) diluted in PBS 1X for 10 min at RT. Once clusters of infected cells were visible (dark stain), the reaction
was stopped by removing the DAB solution followed by
water washing. The foci were counted manually under
the light microscope.
Design and synthesis of siRNAs

The sequences of HAZV L, M and S genomic segments
[GenBank:DQ076419.1, DQ813514.1 and M86624.1,
respectively] were used to design the siRNAs. Duplexes
of 21-nucleotide siRNAs with short 3’ overhangs were
synthesized by Qiagen (Courtaboeuf, France). For each
viral mRNAs, four lyophilized siRNAs were produced

(Table 1) and their sequence was subjected to a BLAST
search against GenBank to minimize off-target effects.
In the present study, a non targeting siRNA (siNT)
showing no complementarities neither with HAZV
mRNAs nor with any human, mouse or rat mRNAs was
used as a negative control (Table 1). The TOX siRNA
(siTOX) (Dharmacon RNAi technologies, Lafayette,
USA) was used to determine transfection efficacy (see
below). Before use, all siRNAs were reconstituted in
rehydration buffer to obtain 20 μM solutions according
to the company’s instructions.
siRNAs transfection and A549 cells infection with HAZV

Twenty four hours before transfection, A549 cells were
seeded in 24-well microplates at a density of 8 × 10 4
cells/well to achieve 60% confluent cell monolayers the
day after. Various siRNAs concentrations (ranging from
0.01 to 100 nM) were complexed with the Lipofectamine
2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen, Cergy Pontoise,
France) in Opti-MEM I medium (Gibco, Invitrogen Corporation, Paisley, United Kingdom). The final volume of
Lipofectamine 2000 was 1.5 μl/well. The transfection
mixture was incubated for 20 min at RT to allow the formation of siRNA/transfection reagent complexes and
100 μl of the solution were added in each well. One day
post-transfection, cells were gently washed twice with
F12K medium and infected with HAZV at a MOI of 0.1.

The inoculum was incubated for 1 hr. Cells were then
cultivated in F12K medium supplemented with 0.4% FCS
for 48 hrs. Infected cells supernatants were tittered as
described above. The EC50 was calculated as the mean of
two independent experiments using the GraphPadPrism
version 4.00 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego
California, USA) for non linear regression.
For the post infection treatment studies, 60% confluent A549 cell monolayers were infected with HAZV for
1 hr at a MOI of 0.01. At 1 hr, 8 hrs or 24 hrs postinfection, 100 μl of the transfection mixture (containing
100 nM of siRNA) were added. One day after transfection, cells were washed, and grown in F12K medium
with 0.4% FCS for 48 hrs. The supernatant from
infected cells were then harvested and tittered.
For each experiment, transfection efficiency was monitored by transfecting A549 cells with 100 nM of siTOX
under the same experimental conditions as described
above. Cells successfully transfected with siTOX
undergo apoptosis and cell death within 24-48 hrs. After
3 days of incubation, siTOX-transfected cells were trypsinized and manually counted using a hematocytometer
(Trypan blue exclusion assay). Transfection efficiency
was calculated as the ratio between the number of viable
siTOX-transfected cells versus non-transfected cells. In
our experiments, transfection efficiency was routinely
above 90%.

Detection of HAZV nucleoprotein by Western blot

A549 cells, seeded in 6-well microplates at a density of 3.2
× 105 cells/well, were transfected with siRNA and infected
with HAZV as described above. Protein extraction was
performed 48 hrs post-infection as follow: confluent cells
were washed twice in fresh phosphate-buffered saline 1X
(PBS 1X) and lysed in buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH
7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 0.6% NP40, 0.5 mM EDTA and protease inhibitors cocktail (Complete EDTA-free, Roche
Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) for 10 min on
ice. After removal of cellular debris by centrifugation at
12,000 × g for 10 min, 20 μl of protein extracts were
boiled for 5 min in Laemmli buffer and separated on a
10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then electrotransferred
onto a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (BioRad Laboratories, Marne-la-Coquette, France). The PVDF
membrane was saturated with 5% dry milk in PBS 1X containing 0.1% Tween-20 and incubated overnight at 4°C
with mouse anti-HAZV hyperimmune ascitic fluid (1:250)
or with mouse anti-GAPDH monoclonal antibody (1:1000,
Ambion, Austin, TX, USA). Horseradish peroxydaselabeled goat anti-mouse IgG (1:10000, Interchim, Montluçon, France) was used as secondary antibody followed by
chemoluminescent (ECL) revelation (Amersham GE
Healthcare, Orsay, France).
ELISA-based assay for interferon-b detection

A549 cells were cultured in 24-well microplates at a density of 8 × 10 4 cells/well and transfected as previously
described with either 100 nM (i.e. 1.48 μg/ml) of siNT,
siS1 and siS2 or 0.25 μg/ml of poly(I:C) dsRNA (SigmaAldrich, St Quentin-Fallavier, France). Cell culture supernatants were harvested 24 hrs post-transfection to detect
human beta interferon (IFN-b). The cytokine measurement was performed using a sandwich enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (PBL Biomedical
Laboratories Tebu-Bio, Le Perray-en-Yvelines, France),
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Antiviral assays with ribavirin and combination with siS1
or siS2

Confluent monolayers of A549 cells in 24-well plates
were infected with HAZV at a MOI of 0.1. Cells were
then cultivated with F12K medium supplemented with
0.4% FCS or treated with 0.4% FCS F12K medium containing serial dilutions of ribavirin (1-b-D-ribofuranosyl1H-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide) (Sigma-Aldrich, St
Louis, Missouri, USA). Forty eight hours post-infection,
the supernatant of each well was collected and virus titer
was performed. The EC50 value for ribavirin was determined as the mean of two independent experiments.
The combination assay required 60% confluent monolayers of A549 cells in 24-well microplates transfected
with siS1, siS2 or siNT at a concentration of 1 nM and

Page 4 of 11

10 nM. One day post-transfection, cells were washed
twice, infected with HAZV at a MOI of 0.1. One hour
after infection, the inoculum was removed and transfected cells were cultured for 48 hrs in 0.4% FCS F12K
medium containing 0, 25 or 50 μM of ribavirin. The cell
supernatants were then tittered.
Statistical analysis

In this study, we compared the antiviral effect of
selected siRNAs to the negative control (siNT) to detect
significant variations using the Student’s t-test (P ≤ 0.05
was regarded as significant difference between the two
groups of transfected/infected cells).

Results
Inhibition of HAZV replication using segment-specific
siRNAs

To evaluate the inhibitory activity of siRNAs on HAZV
replication, twelve siRNAs were designed to target the
mRNAs produced by the L, M, and S genomic segments
(Table 1). We analyzed the inhibitory effect of the L, M
and S-specific siRNAs. As shown in figure 1A, when used
at 100 nM, siS1, siS2 and siS3 strongly inhibited virus
replication by 87.8%, 91.6% and 86.1%, respectively, compared to siNT control (p < 0.05). In contrast, siS4 did not
induce any significant antiviral effect in A549-infected
cells. siM1, siM2 and siM3 showed moderate but significant activities on HAZV replication (38.3%, 56.2% and
29.4% of inhibition respectively) whereas siM4 did not
have any activity (figure 1B). Lastly, siL2, siL3 and siL4
did not inhibit HAZV replication (p > 0.05) while siL1
slightly did (33.5% of inhibition, p = 0.04, figure 1C).
Inhibition of HAZV replication by siS1 and siS2 in A549
cells

Since siS1 and siS2 showed the most efficient anti HAZV
activity, we decided to further focus on the characterization of these two siRNAs. We first tested their efficacy at
100 nM in cells infected at different multiplicity of infection (i.e. MOI 0.01, 0.1 and 1). Whatever the viral load, a
significant inhibition of HAZV replication was observed
for both siRNAs when compared to siNT: the inhibition
ranged from 83.1% to 97.1% for siS1 and from 94.4% to
98.3% for siS2 (figure 2A).
Because siRNAs treatment could be cytotoxic and therefore may affect viral growth, we performed a Trypan blue
exclusion assay to evaluate cell growth and viability upon
siRNA transfection. The morphology of treated cells was
examined daily using phase-contrast light microscopy.
Three days post siRNA transfections, the cell number per
well was determined and compared to non treated cells by
manual counting with a hematocytometer. In these experiments, we did not detect any cytotoxic effect of siS1 and
siS2 on A549 cells at any concentrations used (not

different concentrations of siS1 or siS2 (from 0.01 to 100 nM). Viral titers were determined 48 hrs post-infection. Results are presented as a ratio
between the average foci counts from siRNAs treated wells and counts in siNT (siRNA negative control) transfected cells. Errors bars represent

of siS2 (or 100 nM of siNT or siM4) were loaded on a 10% SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred on a PVDF membrane. Expression of the ~ 50 kDa
NP was detected with an anti-HAZV ascite (GAPDH expression was used as loading control).

shown). We also investigated whether the IFN pathway
could be stimulated in siRNAs transfected cells as
reported in earlier studies [41,42]. We found that the siRNAs tested did not induce any IFN-b response whereas
the poly(I:C) control was a good stimulator (not shown).
Thus, HAZV inhibition was siS1 and siS2 specific and was
not due to any side effects.
We then examined the antiviral effects of increasing
concentrations of siS1 and siS2. A concentration dependent inhibitory activity was observed for both siRNAs
when compared to siNT (figures 2B and 2C). siS1
induced an average inhibition of 64.2% at 0.1 nM and
86% at 100 nM. The production of infectious HAZV
particles was reduced by 70.6% at 0.1 nM and 94% at
100 nM when cells were transfected with siS2. No significant viral inhibition was observed at siRNAs concentration of 0.01 nM. From these experiments the
estimated 50% effective concentration (EC50) was 0.09
nM for siS1 and 0.07 nM for siS2. Thus, both siRNAs
efficiently inhibited HAZV replication in a concentration
dependant manner, in cell culture.
Specific inhibition of NP expression by siS1 and siS2

Since siS1 and siS2 were designed to target the NP transcript, we wanted to demonstrate that HAZV replication
inhibition was associated with NP synthesis reduction. As
shown in Figure 2D, when cells were transfected with different concentrations of siS2, a dose-response decrease of
NP expression was observed. The ~50 kDa NP was
hardly detectable in cells treated with 100, 10 and 1 nM
of siS2 (lanes 3, 4 and 5). This was in sharp contrast with
the amount of NP seen in siNT transfected-cells (lane 2).
When siS2 was used at 0.1 nM, NP synthesis was moderately inhibited (lane 6) while no inhibition was observed
in cells transfected with 0.01 nM of siS2 (lane 7). As
expected, siM4, which did not inhibit HAZV replication
(Figure 1B), did not interfere with NP expression (lane
8). A similar siS1 dose response inhibition of NP production was observed (not shown). Thus, the decrease of NP
synthesis by siS1 and siS2 completely parallels the HAZV
replication inhibition (Figures 2B and 2C).
Antiviral activities of siS1 and siS2 transfected before and
after HAZV infection

To estimate the stability of siRNA in vitro, we performed
a time-course experiment in which A549 cells were
infected at 24 hrs, 48 hrs or 72 hrs after siS1 or siS2
treatment (figure 3A). A significant reduction of HAZV
replication was observed when infection occurred 24 hrs
post-transfection (80% with siS1 and 93% with siS2).
Interestingly, the antiviral effect was maintained at least
three days post-treatment (up to 80.4% and 87.4% inhibition using siS1 and siS2 respectively), indicating the siRNAs stability over this period of time.

Page 6 of 11

We also studied the antiviral effect of siS1 and siS2
transfected at various time post-infection (p-i). As illustrated in figure 3B, when cells are treated 1 hr or 8 hrs
p-i, HAZV titer was reduced by more than 88%. When
cell transfection was performed 24 hrs p-i, a moderate
inhibition > 50% was still observed (P < 0.05). This last
experiment indicated that when used at 100 nM both
siRNAs exhibited a significant antiviral activity on
HAZV that had already been replicating for 24 hrs.
Additive or synergistic inhibition of HAZV replication by
ribavirin and siS1 or siS2

As depicted in figure 4A, ribavirin, which is a ribosyl
purine analogue, exhibited a clear concentration-dependent anti HAZV activity leading to a complete inhibition
at 100 μM. No cytotoxic effect of ribavirin was observed
in the range of concentrations used (data not shown).
The ribavirin EC50 was estimated at 8.9 μM.
Since ribavirin and siRNAs (i.e. siS1 and siS2) have
two distinct modes of action and target two different
viral components (viral polymerase and mRNA coding
for NP, respectively), we wondered whether the combination of ribavirin and siRNAs could induce a higher
inhibitory activity than the sum of the individual activities. We performed an assay in which A549 cells were
transfected with siS1 or siS2, 24 hrs before being
infected with HAZV and then subsequently treated
with 25 μM of ribavirin. As shown in Figure 4B, when
cells were treated with either 1 nM or 10 nM of siS1 in
combination with 25 μM of ribavirin, a significant
synergistic antiviral activity was observed. Similarly,
siS2 at 1 nM in association with 25 μM of ribavirin
reduced the virus titer in a synergistic manner (P <
0.05) (figure 4C). However, at a concentration of 10
nM, the combination of siS2 with ribavirin only
induced an additive effect (figure 4C). In the same way,
when ribavirin was used at 50 μM, an additive antiviral
activity was observed with 1 or 10 nM of siS1 or siS2
(data not shown). Thus, these experiments suggest that
the combinatorial treatment including ribavirin and
NP-targeting siRNAs could represent a strategy to control nairovirus infection.

Discussion
With the noticeable exception of ribavirin recommended
by the World Health Organization (WHO) to treat
CCHFV infection [43], there is no specific medical therapy. Therefore, there is a need for the development of
novel antiviral strategies against nairovirus infections.
In this work, for the first time, we evaluated the antiviral activity of siRNAs targeting the L (polymerase), M
(glycoproteins) and S (nucleoprotein) transcripts of
HAZV, a non pathogenic nairovirus in humans, which is
considered as a surrogate CCHFV model.

Figure 3 Antiviral activities of siS1 and siS2 transfected before and after HAZV infection. A) A549 cells were transfected with 100 nM of
siNT (siRNA negative control), siS1 or siS2, 24 hrs, 48 hrs or 72 hrs before HAZV infection (MOI 0.1). B) Cells were infected with HAZV at a MOI of
0.01 and then transfected with 100 nM of siNT, siS1 or siS2, 1 hr, 8 hrs or 24 hrs post-infection. Viral titers were determined 48 hrs post-infection.
Results are shown as a ratio between virus titer obtained in siRNAs treated wells and titer determined in siNT transfected cells. Errors bars
represent the standard deviation (SD) of the means for at least two independent experiments done in quadruplicates. * Significant differences

We observed that siRNAs complementary to the
mRNAs encoded by the L and M genomic segments had
a lower effect than those targeting the S segment. Interestingly, three studies performed in arthropod cells
showed that the nucleoprotein gene of orthobunyaviruses
is a RNAi prim target. We demonstrated the efficient
inhibition of HAZV in tick cells via RNAi induced by a
Semliki Forest replicon expressing the S segment whereas
the L segment had no effect [44]. In earlier studies, Billecocq et al. and Powers et al. observed a similar phenomenom in mosquito cells infected by Rift Valley Fever
virus [45] and La Crosse virus [46], respectively. Furthermore, in mammalian cells La Crosse virus replication was
successfully decreased by siRNAs targeting the S segment
and similarly to our results, the L and M siRNAs had a
much weaker effect [47]. Finally, orthobunyavirus Akabane replication was inhibited up to 99% by siRNAs
directed against highly conserved regions of the nucleoprotein gene [48].
As other RNA viruses, nairovirus present a high mutation rate which might contribute to their escape from
siRNAs inhibition. The emergence of viral mutants is
lowered when using siRNAs targeting the most conserved viral sequences. Among the three genomic segments, the S segment is the most conserved within the
Nairovirus genus because of its lowest mutation rate
[49,50]. This observation indicates that siRNAs directed
against the S segment are potentially interesting antinairovirus molecules.
The nucleoprotein plays a crucial role in the regulation
of viral transcription and replication. It associates with
genomic RNA and serves as a template for the polymerase to initiate both steps during virus cycle. It is assumed

that cytoplasmic NP concentration is important for the
transition from transcription to replication [2] and therefore, a decrease in NP production should contribute to
virus inhibition, as observed in our study.
Among all tested siRNAs, only three (siS1, siS2 and
siS3) exhibited a strong inhibition of HAZV replication
(up to 90%). The unequal siRNAs efficiency is in agreement with previous works [51-53]. The interaction of
proteins with the viral transcripts or the presence of secondary structures in these mRNAs may interfere the
proper recognition by the homologous siRNAs [54,55],
explaining the variability of siRNAs efficacy. Interestingly,
the combination of siS1, siS2 and siS3 used at a concentration of 33 nM (100 nM siRNA final concentration)
induced ~ 90% virus inhibition which is similar to the
effect observed for each individual siRNAs (data not
shown, figure 1A). The absence of additive or synergistic
antiviral effect observed here was also reported in other
studies. It was hypothesized that the competition of siRNAs for RISC might explain this lack of effect [56,57].
In our study, the two most active siRNAs, siS1 and siS2,
demonstrated a specific inhibitory effect against HAZV in
a dose-dependent manner. These two siRNAs did not
induce IFN production or cell toxicity. We showed that
treatment with each siRNAs correlates with the reduction
of nucleoprotein expression level. A concentration as low
as 0.1 nM for both siRNAs was sufficient to reduce significantly HAZV replication. A similar antiviral effect at such
concentrations had already been described in a previous
study with Epstein-Barr virus [58]. We observed that the
siRNA stability lasted at least up to 72 hrs. The prolonged
stability of siRNAs with a relatively long half life (from 3 to
8 days after transfection) was also shown in experiments

treated with different concentrations of ribavirin (ranging from 0 to 200 μM) for 48 hrs. Results are presented as a ratio between virus titer
obtained in ribavirin treated wells and titer determined in non-treated cells. B) A549 cells were transfected with 1 nM or 10 nM of siS1 or C)
with 1 nM or 10 nM siS2. Cells were infected with HAZV at a MOI of 0.1 and then incubated for two days in medium containing 25 μM of
ribavirin. Viral titers were determined 48 hrs post-infection. The reduction of virus titer is determined after treatment with either ribavirin or siS1
(or siS2) and with the combination of ribavirin and siS1 or siS2. The white bar represents the theoretical sum of antiviral activity obtained with
each compound. The synergistic effect of the combination of ribavirin and each siRNAs is indicated by the grey bar. Nb: no synergy was
observed when siS2 was used at 10 nM with ribavirin. * Significant differences between additive and synergistic effect: Student’s t-test; P < 0.05.

with vaccinia virus [59], monkeypox virus [53], food and
mouth disease virus [60] and HIV-1 [61]. We also demonstrated that the antiviral activity of siRNAs was effective
when carried out after infection. Taken together, the
results are encouraging for the use of siRNA as future prophylactic and therapeutic treatments of nairovirus
infection.
Since its discovery [22], RNAi technology has been
assessed in several clinical trials. Among these, the most
developed assays include the treatment of HIV-1 [62]
and RSV [63]. siRNAs were successfully used against

viral diseases in numerous animal models including
infections affecting the liver: hepatitits C virus [64,65],
hepatitits B virus [31,33,34,66,67] or Hepatitis E virus
[68]. These data suggest that a similar strategy may be
considered to treat patients infected with CCHFV which
has an important hepatotropism.
We demonstrated in vitro the inhibitory activity of
ribavirin against HAZV in a concentration dependent
manner. This guanosine analogue acts through several
mechanisms including the replication of viral nucleic
acid. Ribavirin and siRNAs having distinct modes of

Flusin et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:249

action and different target, it was tempting to use them
in combination to improve the efficacy of each separate
treatment. We reported here the additive or synergistic
effect of siRNAs in combination with ribavirin without
increasing the cellular toxicity. Our results highlight the
interest of a combined therapy. Such a therapy is known
to reduce the drug toxicity by decreasing the active dose
[69] and preventing the antiviral compound resistance
[70,71]. Ribavirin is a potent inhibitor of several viruses
in vitro [16] and in vivo [18]. Thus, it should be interesting to associate ribavirin and siRNAs to treat CCHFV
infections.

Conclusions
We demonstrated the ability of siRNAs targeting transcripts encoded by S segment to inhibit Hazara nairovirus replication in mammalian cell cultures. We
reported the strong antiviral effect of siRNA and ribavirin in a combined treatment. This promising strategy
could be used in a future anti-nairovirus therapy.
