Abstract
Background: Evolution via point mutations is a relatively slow process and is unlikely to
completely explain the differences between primates and other mammals. By contrast, 45% of the
human genome is composed of retroposed elements, many of which were inserted in the primate
lineage. A subset of retroposed mRNAs (retrocopies) shows strong evidence of expression in
primates, often yielding functional retrogenes.
Results: To identify and analyze the relatively recently evolved retrogenes, we carried out
BLASTZ alignments of all human mRNAs against the human genome and scored a set of features
indicative of retroposition. Of over 12,000 putative retrocopy-derived genes that arose mainly in
the primate lineage, 726 with strong evidence of transcript expression were examined in detail.
These mRNA retroposition events fall into three categories: I) 34 retrocopies and antisense
retrocopies that added potential protein coding space and UTRs to existing genes; II) 682 complete
retrocopy duplications inserted into new loci; and III) an unexpected set of 13 retrocopies that
contributed out-of-frame, or antisense sequences in combination with other types of transposed
elements (SINEs, LINEs, LTRs), even unannotated sequence to form potentially novel genes with
no homologs outside primates. In addition to their presence in human, several of the gene
candidates also had potentially viable ORFs in chimpanzee, orangutan, and rhesus macaque,
underscoring their potential of function.
Conclusion: mRNA-derived retrocopies provide raw material for the evolution of genes in a wide
variety of ways, duplicating and amending the protein coding region of existing genes as well as
generating the potential for new protein coding space, or non-protein coding RNAs, by unexpected
contributions out of frame, in reverse orientation, or from previously non-protein coding
sequence.

Background
While it is said that the human and chimpanzee genomes
share anywhere from 95 to 98.5% similarity in their DNA
sequences, base exchanges and small indels alone are

unlikely to completely explain the differences among
diverging primates and between other mammals. Comparative genomics identifies functional elements by
searching for conserved DNA across species and is an

excellent method for identifying highly conserved biological functions [1-4]. However, sequence conservation is
not sufficient to identify newly evolved functions.
Although point mutations in combination with selection
can explain changes in transcriptomes and proteomes, the
high number of retroposition events along the primate
lineage must also be considered to understand the phenotypic difference between primates and other mammals.
Our aim is to understand how one class of these, retroposed mRNA (which we call retrocopies) influenced gene
evolution in primates.
Primates experienced a large increase in retroposed insertions, and at least forty-five percent of the human genome
is composed of retroposed elements [5]. The majority of
random sequences in the human genome are also retroposition-derived, but are too old to be recognized as such
[6]. The subclass of retroposed copies of spliced mRNAs
are referred to as retrocopies, irrespective of their potential
functionality [7]. Retrogenes are then those retrocopies
that do not decay in the genome but have been exapted
into a variant or novel function. Discernible retrocopies
contribute only about 1% of the human genome, yet they
have a much more varied protein coding space than other
more numerous types of retroposed elements, including
the long interspersed elements (LINEs, 21%) and short
interspersed elements (SINEs, 13%). The latter lack protein coding regions altogether. Yet, part of Alu and MIR
SINEs contributed to newly evolved exons [8-12].
Authors differ widely in their assessment of the number of
functional retrogenes [13-18]. Following the first reports
of functional retrogenes in the late eighties [19-21], it was
thought that these were isolated cases, as mRNA retrocopies lack their own promoter elements. Despite this apparent handicap, research in the last 20 years has shown that
gene duplication via retroposition – as opposed to segmental duplication of entire genes including their regulatory elements- is able to equip retrogenes with regulatory
elements that are different from those in the parent gene
and often leads to different expression patterns [22-24].
Formation of new genes via retroposition followed by
positive selection and/or adaptive evolution during modification of genes via exon acquisition has been increasingly reported [7,22,25,26]. In addition to simple
duplication events, gene fusions involving retrocopies
that contribute protein domains with sequence similarities to existing genes were also reported both in animals
[7,27,28] and in plants [26]. Transcribed retrogenes or retrocopies also have the potential to become functional as
non-protein coding RNAs (reviewed by Zheng and Gerstein [14] and Sasidharan and Gerstein [29]).
The number of new genes that have arisen since mouse
and human split from their common ancestor is small

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/466

compared with the total number of human genes [30] and
apparently, most proteins arose by duplication and divergence of existing ones [31]. Yet, it would be surprising if
evolution would not have grasped opportunities of genes
(or parts therof) "out of the blue", i.e., from loci that previously were intergenic or intronic. Early studies suggested
"overprinting" of a protein coding region in a different
reading frame as a means of generating new protein
sequence space [32-34]. This concept has been revisited
one and a half decades later in alternatively spliced genes
[35]. The idea of recruiting novel protein sequence space
out of random intronic sequences dates back to Wally Gilbert's suggestion three decades ago [36] with experimental
evidence initially accumulating slowly [11,37-39]. Interestingly, it has been shown experimentally that an arbitrary sequence can evolve towards acquiring a biological
function [40]. Young genes or young parts of more
ancient genes are a unique set to examine because we can
see both the putative successes and apparent failures of
natural selection, before the latter are erased by mutations. Although our study focuses on these more recent
events, we also find evidence for more ancient events.
This, along with the fact that 12–15% of mammalian
genes are intronless [41], one of the hallmarks of retrocopy retroposition, suggests that the process of retroposition and the idiosyncratic variations of potential novel
protein sequence acquisition have been important for billions of years in generating novel protein-sequence space
[36,42,43]. Our results document that there are many
mechanisms beyond segmental duplication and point
mutations by which genomes generate new genes or variants of existing ones. Retrocopies provide the means for
modifying splice patterns of genes [44], potentially adding entirely new protein coding sequences, and contributing non-protein coding RNA or regulatory sequences,
thereby expanding the possibilities to shape gene evolution. From here on, when we mention retrocopy-derived
protein sequences, ORFs, and/or exons, we assert that they
are potential, hypothetical or theoretical only. The main
rationale of this publication is to delineate the multitude
of possible ways in that mRNA retrocopies, once exapted,
can contribute to novel protein sequences over evolutionary time.

Results
Retrocopies with strong evidence of expression
To determine how many retrocopies are potentially functional, we used BLASTZ to align all human mRNAs to the
human genome, which resulted in several hundred thousand alignments. These matches were then scored for a set
of features, including the number of processed introns;
the absence of conserved splice sites; breaks in orthology
with mouse, dog, and rhesus monkey; the presence, position, and length of the poly(A) tail; and sequence similarity and fraction of the parent mRNA that is represented in

the retrogene (see Methods for full description), indicating evidence of the likelihood of recent retroposition.
From this we obtained a set of 12,801 candidates that are
likely retroposed copies of intron-containing parent
genes. In order to set our score threshold, we compared
our set to the manually curated Vega of processed pseudogenes (retrocopies of mRNAs that may or may not be
functional). When we found disagreements between the
sets, we either improved our feature set or discovered
problems with the Vega annotation. This resulted in
improvements of both. In order to determine if the retrocopies are expressed, we looked for overlap with mRNA or
EST evidence. Following filtering to eliminate 6413 cases
without mRNA or EST evidence, we found that 6,287 retrocopies showed evidence of expression by at least one
EST or one mRNA [See Additional File 1]. For our analysis
we used more stringent requirements for expression (see
below) than previous work. We chose not to use Ka/Ks
analysis to look for evidence of natural selection, mostly
due to the short length of retrogene sequences. Many of
those could be functional parts of genes; however, for
more recent events, final proof might be difficult.
Major categories of retrocopy contributions
To evaluate the types of events that led to new functional
gene candidates or modifications of existing genes, and to
reduce the possibility that a given transcript resulted from
genomic priming, we increased the stringency factor for
evidence of expression and examined in more detail a
reduced set of 726 cases that overlapped at least five ESTs
and one mRNA or annotated as a gene in RefSeq or UCSC
KnownGenes (derived from Swiss-Prot).

We examined, in detail, all cases that were not purely
duplication events, specifically those events that exhibited
evidence of exon acquisition (see Methods): 1) cases with
multiple coding exons, and 2) cases that showed evidence
of contributions from retrocopy ORFs in the antisense
direction. In general, we found that the retroposition
events can be described predominantly by the following
three categories: Type I: exon acquisition, in which part of
the retrocopy was included into an existing gene transcript, in particular, in which a portion of the retrocopy
could potentially serve as a protein coding exon. Type II:
retropositional gene duplication, in which apparently no
pre-existing host gene at the site of insertion was altered.
Type II events, in order be functional, would require
recruitment of resident regulatory elements at the site of
insertion, such as promoters and/or enhancers, and the
process may have been accompanied by intron generation, for example, to reduce the size of 5' UTRs [24].
Finally, Type III retrocopy events occur, in contrast to Type
I and II events, when the retrocopy contributed a sequence
that is largely out-of-frame, derived from a UTR, or in the
opposite orientation with respect to the retrocopy's par-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/466

ent. Other flanking DNA sequences, including those
derived from other transposed elements (SINEs, LINEs,
endogenous retroviruses, and DNA transposons), may
also be co-opted into the structure of these ab initio gene
candidates. Hence, the Type III genes, if functional, have a
protein sequence that is mostly novel.
Comparison with other datasets
We found good agreement between our candidate set of
transcribed retrocopies and the major transcribed retrocopy datasets produced by other groups [7,45,46]. Of the
223 transcribed retrocopies reported by Harrison [45,46]
we agreed with 189 cases. Randomly selected cases that
were missing from our set were cases that relied soley on
scarce EST data and fell below our threshold. Of the ten
randomly selected cases in our set that were missing from
the Harrison set, 30% were present in the Kaessmann set
[7]. Of the remaining cases not present in our set or Kaessman's, 20% have weak expression evidence but were nevertheless classified as retrocopies by Harrison [See
Additional File 1]. In contrast, we found many examples
in the HOPPSIGEN dataset [47] that were not present in
our dataset or Kaessman's set. A random sample of ten
were all found to be either segmental duplications or inactive LINE elements that we assume were false positives in
their data. Kaessmann reported 1,080 expressed retrocopies with at least one EST [7]. We agreed with 936 of these.
Most of the cases missing from our set had mitochondrial,
immunoglobin or zinc finger genes as parent genes. These
were systematically excluded from our dataset because
they are frequently generated by a different mechanism,
i.e., segmental duplication. We reported 936 cases that
were not present in Kaessman's set. Most were due to the
smaller starting gene set that his pipeline used and exclusion of parental UTRs from the analysis.

Although the functional potential of Type II retrogenes
was discussed early on [23,24] and overwhelmingly substantiated over the past 10 years [7,18,22,48], only a few
Type I exon-acquisition events have been reported [49] as
well as de-novo gene evolution [50-52]. The significant
number of Type I and Type III events that we report demonstrates the extent of the contribution of retrocopies to
the evolutionary processes that test, reject, and retain
novel amino acid encoding sequence space. All the retrogene candidates fall along a continuum from a large
degree of similarity (Type II) to little similarity (Type III)
to the original sequences in their respective parent genes.
Many of the putative, novel retrogenes, potentially encoding proteins with no similarities to other existing proteins,
may have been missed by methods relying on protein
alignments, as protein-based screening methods cannot
find antisense insertions and also are not able to align
UTR regions of retrogenes. Protein alignment methods
miss Type III retrogenes entirely. The retrocopies involved

in generation of Type III gene candidates made relatively
small, but potentially 'seeding', contributions to the formation of novel genes. Of course, it must be emphasized
that most of the Type II and Type III mRNA retrocopyderived "retrogenes" described in this study are putative
genes for which no proteins have as yet been documented.
While some of these new transcripts may code for proteins, others may serve as non-protein coding RNAs, possibly involved in cellular regulation [14,29] or in
chromatin remodeling [53].
Overview of types of events whose expression was strongly
supported
Of the 726 candidate retrocopies whose expression was
supported by many transcripts, 624 were composed of
single protein coding exons and 102 contained multiple
protein coding exons. The 102 cases came from a set of
manually examined cases that overlapped known genes
with more than one exon (about 500 cases), single exon
cases transcribed in the reverse orientation based on EST
and mRNA evidence (32 cases), and a random sample of
the other single exon cases that slipped through our initial
screen due to alternative splicing (see Table 1). We compared: 1) the phylogenetic conservation of the ORF in the
various species listed in Methods, 2) the relative contribution of the retrocopy to the new gene, 3) the relative contribution of the host gene (where applicable), 4)
contribution from other types of transposed elements, 5)
whether the retrocopy inserted in the sense or antisense
orientation, and 6) we compared the parent ORF to the
retrocopy ORF looking for frameshifts and mutations.
Conclusions based on phylogenetic analysis are to be

treated with caution as the non-human primate sequences
contain a sufficient percentage of mistakes, erroneously
indicating lack or presence of phylogenetic conservation
in predicted ORFs.
Type I – genes modified by exon acquisition
Of all cases with strong evidence of expression that we
inspected, we identified 5% as being potential gene
fusions, or exon-acquisition events. It is generally
assumed that inserted retrocopies decay without affecting
the structure of the host gene. However, we found several
examples in which part of a retrocopy ORF integrated into
the host gene (Figure 1A, categories 1–4, 6; Table 2), and
often led to alternative mRNA splicing (Figure 1A, categories 1, 4, 5). We cannot be sure of the duration of time
between the retrotranposition event and the start of alternative splicing. The new splice sites were either fortuitously present in the ORF of the retrocopy, or they arose
subsequent to the integration by base changes over time.
We did not observe splice sites in retrogenes that coincided with the splice sites in the parent gene. This is not
surprising, as important intronic parts of splice sites are
removed on the processed mRNA templates prior to retroposition. Therefore, Figure 1 shows generic splice sites as
dotted white vertical lines that do not coincide with splice
sites used in the novel gene context. The six categories in
Figure 1A are defined as follows: 1) Part of protein coding
sequence from parent is used as alternatively spliced exon
of the host gene. 2) Retrocopy contributes new 3' exon to
host gene (mostly in-frame, magenta, and partially out-offrame, dark red, with respect to parent gene). 3) In-frame
contribution (magenta) combined with out-of-frame con-

gene inserted at a locus where no prior gene existed. Type II events often acquired 5' or 3' UTR portions from the locus of integration after the
insertion. Type III: novel gene sequence, whose encoded protein has little or no amino acid sequence similarity to that of the retrocopy's parent.
Frequently, Type III events include SINEs, LINEs, LTRs etc., as well as unannotated sequences as additional contributors to gene candidates.

tribution (dark red) form a new N-terminal encoding
region. A short 5' UTR (medium size bar, dark red) has
been generated from the ORF of the retrocopy.
We also found several examples in which a putative novel
exon had been exapted from an ORF, but the reading
frame is now different from that of the parent gene (Figure
1A, category 4) which results in a shorter transcript. Also,
putative novel exons were exapted entirely from
sequences that correspond to UTRs of the parent gene,
here alternatively sliced (Figure 1A, category 5). In other
instances insertion of a retrocopy and exaptation of an
exon from that sequence triggered recruitment of an additional exon entirely from intronic space. For example, in

Figure 1A, category 6, the retrocopy contributes in-frame
protein coding region (magenta) combined with unannotated intergenic sequence (dark blue) to form a new N-terminal encoding exon for the host gene. In turn, portions
of the intronless retrocopy's protein coding region
became an intronic sequence in the host gene (overlayed
in grey). An interesting example of retrocopy mediated
domain shuffling is the CTGLF1 gene (Figure 1A category
2), which started as a cyclin gene, and then had three
domains (PH, ArfGap and Ankyrin) contributed by insertion of a CENTG2-derived retrocopy. The mouse version
of this gene, AK132782, has only a cyclin domain and represents the ancestral form before the retrocopy insertion.
These observations underscore the fact that natural selec-

tion exapts novel sequence space in addition to slowly
modifying existing sequence space.
Type I exon acquisition in reverse orientation
While at least one group has reported on the existence of
sense retrocopy integrations into existing genes, with coding contributions [7], this is the first report of mRNA retrocopy integrations in the antisense orientation. The
existence of this category of retrocopy events, if functional, supports the idea that natural selection has no preference with respect to the origin of novel sequences. In
this category, novel exons were recruited from retrocopies
that inserted into or adjacent to host genes in the opposite
orientation to the retrocopy's parent gene. As in the case
of Type Ia 'sense' retrocopies, the splice sites in the 'antisense' retrocopies, of course, do not correspond to those
present in the parent genes. Of the Type Ib examples that
we manually inspected, polypyrimidine tracts inserted by
the retrocopy – used for recognition of splice sites – were
frequently derived from antisense oligopurine tracts in the
parent gene. These sequences are often rich in codons for
lysine, glutamic acid, and glycine, as well as certain
codons of arginine in the parent gene. A few Type Ib examples are described in detail below.

1) Internal exon (dark red) added to host gene in the
opposite orientation relative to the parent of the retrocopy
For example, the BRCA1 gene has an alternatively spliced
internal cassette exon (potentially encoding 22 aa) contributed by RPL21 in the antisense direction (Figure 1B,
example 1; Table 2). The insertion occurred after the New
World monkey split and the reading frame is open in
chimpanzee, orangutan, and rhesus monkey.
2) Internal exon added to host gene triggered recruitment
of an additional protein coding exon from formerly
intronic sequence (dark blue). For example, RORA
acquired an internal cassette (encoding 25 aa – PDB structures 1N83 and 1S0X and Swiss-Prot P35398) from an
antisense retrocopy of CYCS. Interestingly, a second exon
(encoding 27 aa) appeared in conjunction with the retrocopy-derived exon, apparently derived from an intronic
sequence, that maintains the frame of the gene (Figure 1B,
example 2). The open reading frame is maintained in
orangutan, rhesus monkey, and marmoset, but there is an
early in-frame stop in chimpanzee (confirmed by our resequencing, unpublished) – an example in which one lineage did not retain such an innovation (see discussion).
3) Recruitment of a 3' exon including novel ORF and 3'
UTR generated from ORF of the retrocopy; it extends the
ORF of the host gene (Figure 1B, example 3). Examples are
SCP2, HLA-F, and KIAA0415 with potentially functional
variants that have alternatively spliced 3' ends that are
derived from antisense retrocopy insertions of RRAS2,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/466

RPL23, and FLJ10324, respectively. The SCP2 variant that
includes the retrocopy-derived exon has a shorter transcript (potentially encoding 338 aa instead of 547 aa) and
is only present in chimpanzee and human. In HLA-F the
insertion generated a longer ORF (potentially encoding
442 aa instead of 362 aa; Figure 1B, example 3). Importantly, the retro-derived variants of SCP2 and HLA-F are
reviewed NCBI Refseq genes.
4) Portion of the retrocopy contributes a potentially alternatively spliced protein coding exon in conjunction with
a novel protein coding exon generated from intergenic
sequence (dark blue). For C6orf148, we detected two
mRNA variants; the first, depicted in Figure 1B (example
4a), presumably also represents the ancestral status prior
to the retrocopy insertion. The second putative variant has
an alternative, upstream promoter, a new first exon from
an unknown source, and a second protein coding exon
(Figure 1B, example 4b) derived from the EIF3S6 retrocopy in reverse orientation. Surprisingly, the third putative coding exon in the second variant is also longer than
the corresponding N-terminal coding region in the original variant. Part of the EIF3S6 UTR was potentially exapted as a protein coding sequence (example 4a). Both
splice forms and open reading frames coexist in chimpanzee and rhesus monkey.
5) Alternative splicing or alternative translation after retrocopy insertion. The first putative protein coding exon
becomes one of the 5' UTR exons (light blue); a second 5'
UTR exon is recruited from unknown sequences. The first
putative protein coding exon (dark red) is recruited from
the retrocopy (Figure 1B, example 5). As in the aforementioned examples, DENN1B and HK1 also exhibit mRNA
variants with and without their respective retrocopies.
Their promoters are shared by both variants and both
have putative alternative translation starts. Interestingly,
in both cases the version with retrocopy contribution does
not start transcription in the first exon, but instead,
includes a second UTR exon before splicing to the retrocopy-derived putative antisense coding exon. The next
protein coding exon is shared by both variants. The ORF
for HK1 is open in chimpanzee, orangutan, and rhesus
monkey. DENN1B has valid ORFs only in human and
chimpanzee, but the retrocopy-derived portion is present
with disruptions in orangutan and rhesus monkey.
6) Two 5' UTR exons, intron, and N-terminal encoding
exon are recruited from the protein coding region of the
retrocopy. For example, one variant of CSMD3 is
expressed in the brain and contains a sequence encoding
a potential N-terminal 79 aa exon (Figure 1B, example
6a). The other putative variant of CSMD3 is expressed in
testes (based on mRNA and EST evidence), and instead of
the 79 aa exon uses part of an antisense RPL18-derived ret-

rocopy; the event might also have led to use of a new promoter for the gene (Figure 1B, example 6b). In addition, a
5' UTR exon and a small intron were derived from the protein coding region of the retrocopy. Only the human version of the retrocopy-containing putative variant has an
intact ORF.
Type II duplication events
Of the Type II events, 60 of them contained one or more
5' and/or 3' untranslated exons acquired along with regulatory elements derived from the flanking region of the
insertion site [see Additional File 2, categories 2 and 3] as
predicted previously [24]. A few examples in which
introns also arose in flanking UTRs were reported recently
[7]. In our numerous examples, we found no indication
that the UTR introns came from the parent gene. Occasionally, a 5' or 3' exon recruited from the locus provided
not only a UTR, but also the first or last protein coding
exon [see Additional File 3]. We also observed shorter and
longer N- or C-terminal encoding parts of genes in separate lineages [see Additional File 2, categories 4–8,10,11],
representing one of the mechanisms that might explain
the frayed ends of many protein homologs, even
orthologs [54]. In addition, we found cases where an
intron arose within the coding region after retroposition
[see Additional File 2, category 8–11, Additional File 3].
These and the aforementioned examples (categories 2 and
3) underscore the notion that even intron-containing
genes, especially those with large exons and relatively
intron-impoverished with respect to their parent genes,
can be derived from retroposition. Similarly, one or several introns of a gene can be lost by recombination with
the corresponding retrocopies [55].
Type III novel gene candidates
In a small fraction of the cases (16) we examined, a putative new gene with no known homologs included a retrocopy (usually only part thereof) that inserted into the
genome and possibly provided protein coding sequence
either 1) out-of-frame (Figure 2A–F, Additional File 4A)
or 2) antisense with respect to the parent gene (Figure 2G–
K, Additional File 4B–E, Table 3 and Additional File 3).

Examples are briefly described as follows: A) The novel
candidate gene FLJ25758 was generated from MARK2derived retrogene featuring protein coding sequence completely out-of-frame with respect to the parent. There is a
potential LTR contribution of promoter and the remaining UTR sequences of FLJ25758 gene were derived from
flanking sequence shown as blue bars. B) The novel candidate gene FLJ40504 was generated from a KRT18derived retrocopy out-of-frame with respect to the parent,
the remainder of the protein coding sequence was derived
from flanking region. C) The first protein coding exon of
candidate gene MGC34774 was derived from a MIR ele-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/466

ment (yellow); the second exon from intergenic region
(blue) and the final protein coding exon from the 5' UTR
and ORF of L13A-derived retrocopy out-of-frame (dark
red). D) The novel gene candidate C15orf21 is processed
into three alternatively spliced transcripts, two of which
use retroposed sequences as first protein coding exon (yellow). The second protein coding exon, in part from
unknown sequences, was fused to an HMG14-derived retrocopy completely out-of-frame. E) The RPL7A-derived
retrocopy contributes half of the ORF in-frame (magenta)
and half out-of-frame (dark red) yielding novel gene candidate Q9BR82. Upstream exons were contributed by
repeats (yellow). F) CT47 gene was generated, in part,
from a NAPL1-derived retrocopy, which contributed the
C-terminal encoding region out-of-frame. Most of the
ORF (blue) arose from intergenic sequence. G) Two alternatively spliced mRNAs originated from an RCN1-derived
retrocopy (3' UTR and ORF) in reverse orientation. H)
LTRs contributed UTR and first protein coding exons (yellow); other exons were derived from intergenic sequence
(blue); candidate gene C20orf91 contains part of a
LOC16236-derived retrocopy in opposite orientation. I)
Two events, retroposition of SNX9 followed by a second
retroposition of SNAG1 or segmental duplication formed
the intron containing candidate gene FLJ25328 in reverse
orientation to SNAG1, presumably with generation of two
introns out of ancestral ORF sequences. J) A novel gene
candidate FLJ13355 (2 splice variants) was formed from a
C18orf24-derived retrocopy (retrocopy ORF contributed
5' UTR and retrocopy 5' UTR contributed N-terminal
encoding region). The second, larger exon including a
large part of ORF was contributed by the internal promoter and 5' UTR region of a LINE element (yellow). K)
An IQCK-derived retrocopy contributed the protein coding exon in reverse orientation (dark red) yielding novel
gene candidate FLJ32895. Downstream UTR exons were
derived from Alu elements and intergenic sequences.
One can summarize the following: Although there is no
evidence that a protein is produced, the size of the putative new ORFs ranged from 81 to 259 aa in human, and
seven maintained open reading frames in human, chimpanzee and orangutan. Only four cases also had open
reading frames in rhesus monkey and only two also in
marmoset (Table 3). Suprisingly, all but three had multiple putative exons, lending further weight to the notion
that we were not observing random transcription. While
fusions between existing genes and mobile elements have
been described [56], we also observed exons that were
generated, in conjunction with the retrocopy, by other
types of transposed elements and/or unannotated
sequences. For example, most of the CT47 gene [57]
which has evidence of protein coding sequence (SwissProt Q5JQC4) arose initially from unannotated sequence
(see below), amplified by segmental duplication and has

events. For each part of the figure, the spliced parent mRNA is shown first (before retroposition) and the resulting gene(s)
are shown below. New sequence space was triggered by a combination of retrogene insertions, recruitment of non-genic
regions including retroposons, whereby the contribution of the retrocopy's original in-frame ORF is very small (see text and
legend to Fig. 1 including color key for further details). Yellow boxes with grey vertical stripes and yellow medium size bars
correspond to retroposed element contributions to ORFs and UTRs, respectively. For detailed descriptions see text.

a valid ORF in human, chimpanzee, orangutan, rhesus
macaque, and marmoset. Other cases in which a gene
arose from unannotated sequences have been described in
flies [50-52]. Out of the 16 primate cases, seven had putative protein coding regions that included repetitive elements [shown in yellow tall boxes, Additional File 4A].
One was composed of a chimeric fusion of two retrocopies [see Additional File 4A, Additional File 3].

Functional categories of source genes
We looked at GO annotations of the parent genes that
spawned retrocopies. For both the expressed on nonexpressed sets of retrocopies we found no statistically significant enrichment from a normally distributed set.

Discussion
The more than 700 instances of evidently transcribed retrocopies in the human genome indicate that this process
has contributed significantly to our transcriptome, and
may have contributed novel protein coding segments

more often than previously appreciated. How these
changes altered the content and regulation of the repertoire of protein coding genes remains to be experimentally investigated. However, it is evident that the retrocopy
mechanism provides an extremely versatile means to
tinker with gene structure, and many of the topologically
possible kinds of novel exon recruitment events seem to
have been explored.
We observed retroposition events that happened prior to
vertebrate diversification, those that date from after the
Homo sapiens lineage diverged from that of the chimpanzees, and those that occurred at times between these
events. Each of these events was/is initially a chance event
– probably neutral at best. The combination of neutral
forces and natural selection are responsible of the future
trajectories, whether such a gene with retrocopy contribution persists or is abandoned in all or some of the subsequent lineages after a "trial period", which can be very
short or last for tens of millions of years. This does not differ from genes that arose entirely by segmental duplication. In either case, a certain proportion is eventually
discarded in all or some lineages, after being active for
some time, while others persist.
Does segmental duplication or retroposition lead to more
functional duplicated genes? The fact that some retrocopies lack their own promoters might be construed as a disadvantage. However, the high percentage (as much as
70%) of the genome being transcribed [58] should help
neutralize this apparent disadvantage. Moreover, recruitment of a novel promoter might be an advantage over that
of an amplified gene that was generated via segmental
duplication. In fact, many retrogenes exhibit expression
patterns that are drastically different from those of the parent genes [23]. Perhaps the increase in retroposition in
primates has allowed greater regulatory flexibility to
evolve in a relatively short time.
The uncertainty of a long life after the birth of a gene is not
much different from the exonizations of novel sequence
domains in "established" host genes. Krull [10] examined
the history of five Alu element exonizations by phylogenetic analyses and found that many of these events did
not persist in all lineages in which they were exonized. In
contrast, of five MIR element exonizations analyzed, four
are present and expressed as mRNA in all mammals examined [11,12], and there are likely many more – thus far
unproven – MIR exonizations. When comparing the older
MIR exonizations with the younger Alu exonizations, it is
apparent that over the past billion years, most exonization
were transient and, due to low levels or lack of evolutionary pressure, did not persist. As an aside, it appears that
exonizations can occur at any time following the SINE
insertion. There is one apparently old and previously neu-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/466

trally evolving MIR that only "recently" was exapted as a
protein coding exon in the alpha1 nicotinic cholinergic
receptor gene in great apes [11]. Likewise, it is conceivable
that a retrocopy or part thereof can be exapted at any stage
of decay (see C20orf91 example). At the same time, it is
clear that some of the aforementioned Alu exonizations
have persisted in some lineages and not in others. The inability to predict whether an event will persist is equally
impossible for younger Type II retrocopy insertion events.
Novel exon recruitment often occurs at the ends of genes.
Eleven of the 36 Type I (exon acquisition) mRNA retrocopy events added exons at the 3' or 5' ends of the transcripts, while only four transcripts contained coding exons
inserted internally, the remaining cases have new UTR
exons added to existing genes. This makes sense if one
considers that only one splice site needs to be added to
extend the ORF at the end of the gene. We also observed
that Type II retrogenes, presumably during phases of no or
little purifying selection and/or during periods of positive
selection, frequently changed in different lineages, mostly
with respect to the N- and C-terminal encoding parts of
the ORFs (i.e., frayed ends). For example, in one lineage
the C-terminal encoding part of the ORF is truncated compared to the orthologous region in another lineage. It
might be reasoned that changes at protein extremities are
better tolerated than elsewhere in the protein. This is supported by large-scale sequence comparisons of orthologous proteins, in which the terminals vary more than do
the rest of the proteins [54,59].
Apart from the acquisition of existing protein domains
(Type I events), the acquisition of novel protein sequence
space via retroposition (Type III events) plays a role in ab
initio formation of genes. Apart from hitherto neutrally
evolving sequences (see below under iv), these putatitvely
novel genes can include i) ORF exons from what corresponds to 5' and 3' UTRs of the parent genes; ii) ORF
exons out-of-frame with respect to the parent gene; iii)
ORF exons from any retrocopy part, inserted in the antisense orientation; and iv) ORF exons from intronic
sequences or intergenic regions adjacent and in addition
to the co-opted retrocopy parts. Extreme cases are those
examples in Figure 2, in which the retrocopy did not contribute much novel or pre-existing sequence space, but
contributed to the formation of potential genes out of
unannotated intergenic regions or retroposons.

Conclusion
Examining the births of these, as yet, putative retrogenes
provides us with important ideas concerning the evolution of older, known genes – or parts therof. Of course, for
young events the "gene" status is hard to prove short of
experimental verification of a functional protein product,
and for older events the history of the gene modules is

more difficult to discern. These points notwithstanding,
whether or not the examples presented will stand the test
of time – either on an evolutionary scale or in the lab (if
experiments can be devised that are conclusive), this is
clearly another way that novel genes or gene variants can
arise. We see evidence of the diversity of tinkering that
occurs with genes beyond simple point mutations. The
generation of new transcripts with protein coding potential derived from anti-sense retrocopies would be an unexpected contribution to protein evolution, if function can
be shown. Thus, retroposition is certainly a mechanism
that can help explain the differences that we see in phenotypes between species.

Methods
Algorithm for finding candidate retrocopies in the human
genome
The search for and identification of retrocopies and their
corresponding parent genes have been confounded by the
existence of gene duplications generated by other evolutionary processes, such as segmental duplication. To avoid
such difficulties we first aligned all human mRNAs (with
poly-A tails removed) to the human genome using
BLASTZ, and looked for sites where mRNAs aligned in
more than one location [60], indicating that one or more
gene copies have been made. If one of the locations was
annotated as a known gene (referred to as the "parent
gene"), we then assigned a confidence score, based on the
analysis of a feature vector, to each of the other alignment
hits to determine if a retroposition event had occurred.
For each putative retrocopy locus, we constructed a feature
vector from a number of features (listed below) and used
a score function to assign a weight to each feature associated with a retroposition event. A schematic of the entire
'pipeline' is presented in Figure 3.
Score Function
To exclude segmental duplications (without retrocopy
origin) and other non-retroposition related events, we
used a score function based on a weighted linear combination of each feature (described below) to evaluate
whether a retrocopy event had occurred. For each alignment above, we generated a set of features and applied the
score function [see Additional File 3] with a threshold. We
trained the weights and the threshold on a set of curated
processed pseudogenes (non-functional retrocopies)
from the Vega dataset [61]. Vega was chosen since they
have a set of carefully manually curated set of pseudogenes using standards used by Sanger in the Vega pseudogene annotation. We used a set of 2,838 processed Vega
pseudogenes as positive examples and 303 Vega nonprocessed psuedogenes as negative examples to set the
weights. Chr18 was held out from the Vega training set so
that we could check the weights against a set that was not
used for training. We then checked high scoring false pos-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/466

itives against the Vega set of processed pseudogenes. In
some cases we found misannotations in their dataset and
they updated their procedure for curation. They discovered that there were differences in how the curators
defined pseudogenes that were rectified in subsequent
Vega releases (J. Harrow, personal communication).
The following score function was used to combine the features defined below. We used a threshold of 650 to filter
the set of 12,801 retrogenes. The threshold was set based

Description of Features
For each putative retrocopy alignment we extracted the
following set of features:

• The most obvious sign of retroposition is the presence of
multiple contiguous exons with introns removed. This signal can be weakened by any insertions, deletions, and
substitutions that occur after retroposition. We counted
the number of contiguous processed exons in the retrocopy and compared that to the parent gene. We did not
count any recent Alu/LINE insertions as introns, as that
has been a problem with other methods (Zhang, D; personal communication). When we aligned the mRNA to
both parent gene and putative retrocopy loci, we were able
to map the location of the breaks in the alignment back to
the mRNA coordinates. For the parent gene, most of these
insertions (larger than 35 bp) corresponded to introns.

We made the assumption that if the insertion was larger
than 35 bp and it occurred within 7 bp of the splice site in
the parent gene, then it was a spliced intron at the retrocopy location. If no splice site was found at this location
in the retrocopy and the mRNA was alignable at this location, then it was counted as a "spliced exonn. This feature
had the heaviest weight assigned as it is the strongest signal of retrotransposition [see Additional File 3].
• Conserved splice sites were counted by looking at the
position of the splice sites in the parent gene in cDNA
coordinates. These positions were mapped to the retrogene and any break in the alignment that was larger than
35 bp and within 15 bp of the splice site in the parent gene
were considered a retained splice site and reduced the
count of the spliced exons. Most retrocopies should not
have any conserved splice sites, but occasionally they have
retained an intron due to incomplete processing prior to
insertion. Therefore this feature's weight was lowered to
allow a small number of conserved splice sites provided
other signals were strong.
• We counted the number of introns in the retrocopy by
looking at gaps in the alignment of the parent cDNA to
the retrocopy locus that were larger than 35 bp. If there
was no corresponding gap on the cDNA side of the alignment, or if the break in the alignment on the genome side
was at least three times larger than the break in the alignment on the cDNA side, then it was counted as an intron
and assigned a large negative weight. We masked out Alu/
LINE repeat insertions before calculating this feature to
avoid counting recent transposons as introns.
• The ''relative orthology with mouse'' feature took advantage of the fact that retrocopies inserted since the mouse/
human divergence show a break in the human-mouse
genomic alignment as defined by the UCSC syntenic
alignment nets [62]. Relative orthology is defined as the
ratio of the size of the putative retrocopy to the size of the
genomic insertion – defined by the break in the alignment
''net'' (from by the UCSC Browser). Ratios close to one
represent possible retroposition events and ratios close to
zero are most likely segmental duplications. Non-processed pseudogenes tend to score low because they are
often generated via large segmental duplication events.
We used the same relative orthology feature with the dog/
human and rhesus monkey/human alignment nets to
avoid false assignments due to deletions in mouse. The
weight on this feature was less than the previous feature
since older events will not show a break in orthology.
• The poly(A) tail feature measured the length of the
poly(A) tail that was inserted into the genome during retroposition [63]. For more recent insertions, this signal distinguishes retrocopies from non-processed pseudogenes.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/466

The poly(A) tail was determined to be the largest scoring
segment in a window of 70 bases near the end of the retrocopy. A's were scored +1 and the remaining three bases
were scored -1. The weight was rather low, because
poly(A) tails can also arise by chance or secondary retroposon insertions, thus, they did not add much weight to
the score unless they were quite long.
Since we used a score function to classify retrocopies, the
absence of one or two features did not exclude a given candidate. In this way we identified retrocopies that did not
show orthology breaks in mammals, which also enabled
us to identify older events. Likewise, absence of a poly(A)
tail (e.g., in older or truncated retrocopies) did not lead to
exclusion. To evaluate the transcriptional competence of
the retrocopy set, in addition to the normal criteria used
in the UCSC Genome Browser [64-66], we only used
cDNA (mRNA) and EST evidence that uniquely mapped
to the retrocopy and not to the parent gene in at least five
nucleotide positions.
Filtering Alignments
We removed any candidate retrocopies that overlapped by
more than 50% with repeats identified by RepeatMasker
[67] and Tandem Repeat Finder [68]. Because RepeatMasker appeared to be overly aggressive in misclassifying
pseudogene insertions as repeats, we corrected this by performing a base-by-base intersection with CENSOR
[69,70] and eliminated only masking regions where
RepeatMasker and CENSOR agreed. We also removed low
percentage identity alignments (below 75%) that overlapped Alu elements. We found that recent independent
Alus that were close to the parent and the retroposed segment were included in the alignments to the parent genes,
generating false alignments, which we discarded manually.
Determining the Parent Loci
To find the locus of the originating parent gene, we looked
for places where the parent mRNA aligned at least twice in
the genome and defined the parent location as the best
genome hit defined by the UCSC Genome Browser mRNA
and refSeq tracks. The other non-overlapping hits define
the locations of the retrocopies.
Resolving Conflicts from Multiple Parent Genes
To resolve conflicts posed by multiple potential parent
genes, we initially took the simple approach of labeling as
the most likely true parent the gene with the highest percent identity to the retrocopy. However, there were many
cases in which retrocopies subsequently were copied via
segmental duplications that occurred relatively recently
during primate evolution [71,72]. To handle these cases,
we selected the parental gene with the highest retrocopy
score. Our aim here was not to unequivocally determine

Page 16 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:466

the correct parent gene among the segmentally duplicated
copies, but merely to look for functional elements arising
from retroposition regardless of whether they occurred
before or after other duplications.
Filtering out Zinc Finger, Mitrochondrial and
Immunoglobin Genes
We found a high number of potentially false positives in
our initial gene set due to the large size of the zinc finger,
mitrochonrial and immunoglobin gene families. Since
many of these copies were generated via mechanisms
other than retroposition, we excluded all of these cases
from our dataset.
Determining Expression using mRNA and EST Evidence
The candidate retrocopies identified by the above process
were then screened for an overlap with BLAT mRNA and
EST alignments [64]. We used BLAT instead of BLASTZ
since it is aware of splice sites and is better at aligning
mRNAs to the genome. In cases where the retrocopy was
very similar to the parent gene, we found that it was necessary to look at individual bases that were different
between the two genomic locations. We required that the
mRNA align better to the retrocopy location than did the
parent gene at a minimum of 5 positions. We measured
this by counting the number of sites (excluding SNPs)
where an mRNA base differed from the genomic base to
which it was aligned. A few such differences can occur in
the alignment of the parent gene's mRNA to the DNA of
the parent gene due to polymorphism, or to errors in the
mRNA sequences [66]. If we could not uniquely identify
the genomic locus for an mRNA or EST, then it was not
considered evidence of expression. We used the program
bestOrf [73] to score putative retrogenes for protein coding potential. Cases scoring less than 50 were removed.
The program outputs potential CDS positions produced
taking into account probabilities of each potential start
codon, as well as longest ORF positions, extending the of
CDS upstream from start codon). We then categorized the
resulting set of expressed candidate retrogenes two ways:
first, by type of evolutionary event, and second, by the
strength of the evidence of expression. The entire pipeline
is shown in Figure 3 (see additional files 4567 for numbers) .
Classification of Retrocopies according to Evolutionary
Event
Finally, we classified the retrocopies found in our initial
set of genes into three types. The Type I retrocopies contributed domains, in either the sense or antisense orientation, to known multiple coding exon genes [74] or to
those found in the Refseq database [75]. Type II retrocopies consisted of duplications of one or more coding exons
derived from the parent gene that formed new genes independent of host genes. Those cases with additional UTR

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/466

exons or small coding exons derived from intergenic
regions were also considered Type II. All remaining cases
were considered Type III, defined as retrocopy contributions, in either the sense or antisense orientation, to novel
genes out-of-frame with respect to the retrocopy parent,
combined with major contributions from other types of
retroposed elements and protein coding segments derived
from the unannotated genomic environment. Retrogenes
containing Type III retrocopies were defined as having no
significant BLAST alignment to any other protein coding
genes (using an e-value threshold of 0.01).
Species Comparisons
In order to determine the age of the retrocopies, we used
outgroup analysis. We checked for the presence and/or
absense of all 726 candidate retrocopy genes in the following species (UCSC Genome browser databases http://
genome.ucsc.edu (shown in parenthesis) :Homo sapiens
(hg18), Pan troglodytes (panTro2), Macaca mulatta
(rheMac2), Mus musculus (mm8), and Canis familaris
(canFam2). For the recent events (based on their presence
in human and rhesus monkey and absence in mouse and
dog) we selectively looked at the trace archives of Pongo
pygmaeus abelii (orangutan) and Callithrix jacchus (marmoset). We manually assembled traces orangutan and
marmoset from the NCBI trace archive to determine if the
reading frame was open in the cases shown in tables 2 and
3. In a few selected cases of older events (present in all of
the above species), we also examined chicken (galGal3)
and C. elegans (ce2).
