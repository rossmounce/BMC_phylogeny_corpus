Abstract
Background: Rabies virus (RV), the agent of rabies, can cause a severe encephalomyelitis in several species of
mammals, including humans. As a human rabies vaccine strain employed in China, the genetic knowledge of the
aG strain has not been fully studied. The main goal of the present study is to amplify the whole genome of aG
strain, and genetic relationships between other vaccine strains and wild strains were analyzed.
Results: The entire genome of human rabies virus vaccine strain aG employed in China was sequenced; this is the
second rabies virus vaccine strain from China to be fully characterized. The overall organization and the length of
the genome were similar to that of other lyssaviruses. The length of aG strain was 11925nt, comprising a leader
sequence of 58nt, nucleoprotein (N) gene of 1353nt, phosphoprotein (P) gene of 894 nt, matrix protein (M) gene
of 609nt, glycoprotein (G) gene of 1575nt, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp,L) gene of 6384nt, and a trailer
region of 70 nt. There was TGAAAAAAA (TGA7) consensus sequence in the end of each gene, except AGA7 at the
end of G gene. There was AACAYYYCT consensus start signal at the beginning of each gene.
Conclusions: In this report, we analyzed the full genome of China human rabies vaccine strain aG. Our studies
indicated that the genome of aG retained the basic characteristics of RV. At gene level, N was the most conserved
among the five coding genes, indicating this gene is the most appropriate for quantitative genotype definition.
The phylogenetic analysis of the N indicated the aG strain clustered most closely with Japanese and Russian rabies
vaccine strains, suggesting that they may share the same ancestor; also, the aG strain did not share high homology
with wild strains isolated from China, making it may not be the best vaccine strain, more research is needed to
elucidate the genetic relationship among the RV circulating in China.

1. Background
Rabies is a widespread neurological zoometric disease
which affects almost all kinds of mammals, including
humans. The morality is almost 100%. It is reported
that nearly 55,000 human die of rabies all over the
world each year, most occurred in Asia and Africa [1].
Following India, China has the second highest number
of human cases in the world [2]. The causal agent of the
disease is rabies virus (RV), a member of Lyssavirus
genus, Rhabdoviridae family. The RV genome is almost
12 kb in size consisting of five monocistronic RNAs,

which encodes the nucleocapsid protein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), glycoprotein (G) and
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (large protein).
Between the monocistronic there are four intergenic
regions (IGRS) with different length [3]. Besides, at the
end of the genome there are two underinflated regions
(UTRS), which play an important role in virus
replication.
So far, vaccination is the most effective method to
prevent rabies. The vaccine strains employed in China
are CTN, aG, PM and PV. The complete genome
sequence of CTN strain has been sequenced already [4].
Although novel vaccines, such as oral vaccine and live
attenuated vaccine have been developed in recent years,
the virus strain used for the production of vaccine are

still pathogenic for laboratory and wildlife spices, what is
more important, these rabies vaccines have the potential
of causing vaccine-induced rabies and appear to have
limited efficacy in a broad spectrum of animal species
[5]. Therefore, genetic knowledge of vaccine strain is
essential. Also, comparison of sequence of vaccine strain
and field strain circulating in the country would prove
how effective of the vaccine against the field virus [6].
The aG strain, also known as pG strain, was obtained
from a rabid dog in 1931, Beijing. After 50 passages in
the brain of rabbit, the strain was named aG strain.
Then, the aG strain has been adapted to VERO cell cultures after 68 passages. Much higher antibody was
obtained in immunized dogs, and the morality was
lower. Since then, the aG strain has been chosen for the
production of human rabies vaccine. Before this study,
P, M, G and L genes of aG strain have been sequenced;
however, this is the first time that the complete genome
has been sequenced. In the present paper, the complete
sequence of the rabies virus vaccine strain aG employed
in China was sequenced. The sequence obtained indicates that aG strain genome is similar to the sequence
of other complete lyssavirus genome available in Genbank. Sequence comparison with other rabies virus
strain and phylogenetic analysis according to the N gene
also falls within the scope of this study.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Virus strain

The aG strain was prepared and stored by State Key
Laboratory of Veterinary Etiological Biology, Lanzhou
Veterinary Research Institite, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Science (LVRI, CAAS). The parental virus was
isolated from a rabid dog’s brain from Beijing, China, of
a patient died of rabies from Beijing 1931, China. After
31 passages in primary hamster kidney (PHKC) cell, it
was chosen for vaccine production in China [4].

According to the conserved regions of the genome of
rabies virus published in GenBank, particular the RCHL(Genbank number: AB009663), RV-97(Genbank
number EF542830), Nishigahara(Genbank number:
AB044824) and NI-CE(Genbank number: Ab128149), 12
pairs of primers were designed to amplify the unknown
regions of aG strain by primer premier 5.0 software
(Table 1). All primers were synthesized by Shanghai

Co., Ltd.

manufacture’s instruction. Single cDNA was synthesized
by using First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (ToYOBO),
and the cDNA were amplified using KOD Plus Neo
(TOYOBO). Amplified DNA products were examined
via electrophoresis using 0.8% ultrapure TM Agarose
(Invitrogen) gels. DNA products of expected size were
purified using Agarose Gel DNA Purification Kit
(TAKARA). The purified products were added to A at
the end of 3’end using DNA A-tailing Kit (TAKARA)
and then ligated with pMD18-T (TAKARA), the ligated
products were transformed into competent cell JM109
(TianGen), at least 3 clones carrying the PCR products
of expected size were identified by PCR and the positive
clones were sequenced commercially (Shanghai Sangon
biological Engineering Technology &Services Co., Ltd.,
China).

ligase (Invitrogen) to circularize the genome. Thereafter
the ligated RNA was subjected to nested PCR with the
primer marked with F 11F, 11R, 12F and 12 R located
within the 5’and 3’end of the genome. Products of the
expected size were dealt with above.
2.4 Sequence alignment and analysis

Nucleotide sequences obtained were edited and
assembled manually using EditSeq of DNAStar program
7.0 (DNAStar). Phylogenetic analysis of N gene of Lyssavirus, including the construction of phylogenetic tree
were conducted using Molecular Evolutionary Genetics
Analysis (MEGA) Version 5.0 with the methods of
neighbor-joining (NJ) algorithm with the Kimura twoparameter model. The reference sequences have been
listed in Table 2. The reliability of the phylogeny groupings was evaluated using bootstrapping with 1000 replicates. Bootstrap values of 70% or greater were viewed
significant.

3. Results
3.1 Genome organization of the aG strain

Using a total of 24 primers (as shown in table 1) the
strain aG genome was obtained as 12 separate overlapping PCR products. The 5’- and 3’-terminal were
obtained as mentioned above. The length of the genome is 11925 nucleotides(nt), and the genome organization of aG strain, which follows typical rabies virus
organization, is summarized as follows: a 3’ leader
region of 58 nt(1-58), the N gene (59-1482), P gene
(1485-2476), M gene (2482-3284), G gene (3290-5356),
L gene (5381-11855), and the 5’trailer region of 70 nt
(11855-11925). The coding sequence (CDS) of each of
the five structural genes are as follows:1353-nt nucleotide (71-1423), 894-nt phosphoprotein(1515-2408),
609-nt matrix protein (2497-3105), 1575-nt glycoprotein (3317-4891) and 6384-nt large protein(541111794). The G-L non-coding region is 455nt. The
sequences of the transcription initiation sites (TIS) and
the termination signals of the structural genes and the
intergenic regions (IGRS) among these genes are
shown in table 3.
3.1.1. Nucleotide feathers of strain aG

The length and sequence of leader region is highly conserved in all lyssavirus. The length of the leader region
is 58nt. The first 12 nucleotides, especially the first 9
are the same in all the lyssavirus. However, the conservation is not so stringent after residue 25. Following
most lyssavirus, the trailer regions of aG strain is 70nts.
The complementarity of the 3’and 5’ ends of the
genome is another typical feather of the Mononegavirals, with up to 16 nts are complemented. The first 9 nts
of the genome leader regions are absolutely

Page 3 of 11

complementary to the corresponding regions of the trailer regions [7] (Figure 1).
The transcription initiation signals (TISs) and transcription termination signals (TTS) are conserved as
AACAYYHCT and G (A) 7, but the TTS between G-L
was AGAAAAAAA at the N-P junction. The intergenic
regions between the cistrons CT, CCGAA, ACTATT
and CTGTAGATCGAAAGAGCAACTGGC (Table 3).
Pairwise comparisons of nucleotide and predicted amino
acid sequence identities of the aG with the vaccine
strain of lyssaviruses are listed in Table 4.
3.2 Structural feathers of the proteins of aG strain

Consistent with previous studies, at the nucleotide level
N was the most conserved gene [8]. The N protein of
aG strain is 450 amino acid residues. Only 10Ala amino
acid substitution is unique to the strain aG. Antigenic
site I (residues 358-367), antigenic site IV (375-383,
359-366) and RNA-binding domain (residues 298-352)
were found to be conserved in all the isolates analyzed.
Ser389, which was considered to be related to caseintype phosphorylation site and regulation of viral RNA
transcription and replication, was highly conserved [9]
(Figure 2).
P gene was considered to be the most divergent protein among the five structural proteins. Six amino acid
substitutions, Lys68, Tyr95, Thr 174, Thr184, Glu254 and
Glu295, unique to the aG were observed. The interaction
of the motif [(K/R)XTQT] between residues 145-149
with cytoplasmic dynein light chain (LC8), which plays
an important role in viral nucleocapsid axoplasmic
transport, was encoded as KSTQT [10]. Compared with
vaccine strain, the N protein binding site (69-177 and
268-297) of aG strain had one unique amino acid residues substitution, Tyr 95 . The L binding site in P, the
first 19 amino acid residues, was absolutely conserved in
aG. Ser162, Ser210, Ser271, which have been shown to be
involved in the phosphorylation of P were well conserved in the aG strain [11] (Figure 3).
M protein connects the plasma membranes, RNPS and
G protein together, and is deeply involved in the budding of rabies virus. Thr100, Ser111 and Ser174 were the
three amino acid substitution to the strain aG. The
motif proline-rich (PPxY) between residues 35-38 is
thought to be associated with the interaction with WW
domains of cellular components, and was encoded
PPEY, which is very conserved [12]. Residue 58, which
is crucial for regulation of RV RNA synthesis [13] (Figure 4), was encoded Glu in aG strain and Gly in PV
strain.
The G protein of 514 amino aicd residues is the only
viral protein exposed on the surface of the virus and
responsible for the immune responses of the host. Compared with vaccine strain analysed in this study, there

are eight amino acid substitutions unique to aG strain:
His69, Pro184, Pro250, Gly427, Ile431, Ile477, Lys481, Asn160.
Antigenic site I (residue 231), antigenic site II(residues
34-42,198-200), antigenic site III (residues 330-338),
antigenic site IV(residue 264) and antigenic site a (residue 342) were conserved. Ala 242 , sp 255 , Ile 268 and
Arg333, which are considered to be associated with viral
pathogenicity, were replaced with Cys, Met, Thr and Ala
respectly (Figure 5).
L protein is an important component of RNP,
although the N and P protein are also needed to form
RNP. The 2,127 amino acid residues of L protein are
distributed into six conserved motifs.
Three potential N-glycosylation sites, which are
located at 37-39, 158-160 and 319-321 were conserved
in aG. The L gene of aG encoded a protein of 2,127amino acid, and thirteen amino acid substitutions
unique to strain aG were observed: Gly48, Gly58, Gln189,
Tyr 353 , Gly 489 , Gly 496 , Ser 606 , Lys 995 , Val 1043 , Ser 1133 ,
Tyr1588, Leu1658, His1801. The motifs among 544-563(A),
728-732(B) and 1705-1710(C) have been regarded as
functional motifs. These motifs are involved in RNA
binding, active site of polymerase, polyadenylation or a
core of ATP binding site. All these amino acid residues
were conserved in strain aG (Figure 6). In the absence
of clear functions for these residues, the importance of
any of these changes is presently unknown.
3.2 Phylogenetic analysis of N

As shown by the phylogenetic analysis of the nucleoprotein gene (Figure 7), the three vaccine strain Nishigahara, NI-CE and RC-HL were grouped with aG most
closely.

4. Discussion
In the present study, the entire aG genomic sequence,
which is composed of 11925 bp, was determined by 12

paris overlapping fragments covering the whole genome
to improve our knowledge of the genetic relationship
between aG strain and other strain of rabies virus available in Genbank. In contrast to the previous report [14],
the length of the whole genomes in GT 1 lyssaviruses
varies from 11711-nt to 12278-nt, with both even and
odd numbers of nucleotides being represented [15,8]. In
contrast to previous studies, the laboratory adapted vaccine strain aG has a odd nucleotide, while other laboratory isolates, such as Nishigahara, PV and SAD-B19
strain, have genomes of even nucleotides numbers [16].
It seems that genomes of odd numbers of nucleotides
are more common in wild type strains than fixed strain
but both odd and even numbers of genomes occurred in
wild type strains and fixed strain. It remains to be determined that whether the isolates with odd or even numbers of the genome has any biological significance.
However, the number of the sequence does not follow
the ‘rule of six’ [17].
On average, the G+C content of the lyssaviruses genome is 44.57%, the G+C content was 45.18 mol% for aG
strain. This is in agreement with the idea that the G+C
content of the negative-stranded RNA viruses is lower
than that of positive stranded RNA viruses, which has
been considered to be associated with host cell RNA
editing [18]. In agreement with previous studies, the
genome of aG strain is similar to that of other lyssaviruses with few variations. The complete nucleotide
length of aG strain is 11,925nt, which was one, seven
and three nucleotides shorter than that of Nishigahara,
PV and SAD-B19 strain. Transcriptional initiation and
termination signals of aG strain at the beginning and
end of the each monocistron, including the motif
AACAYYHCT initiatite transcription and a nine nucleotide motif WG(A)7, except the AGAAAAAAA TTP at
the N-P junction, which is involved in transcription termination and polyadenylation (TTP), are precisely the

same as described by Marston. All the intergenic
sequences (IGS) in the aG agree precisely with what was
described in that report. Unlike PV and SAD strains, the
G-L intergenic region of aG strain has only one polyadenylation site. The 3’ and 5’ of the genome not only play
an important role in transcription, replication and the
switching between these two functions, but also in the
initiation of encapsidation. The 11 nts at the leader and
trailer region of the genome were complementary conserved. These regions showed that the basic structure of
rabies virus have been retained in strain aG [19].
It is reported that the 3’NCR of G mRNA to be the
pseudogene, because there were two TTP motifs in PV.
However, in aG strain, there is only one TTP motif,
which holds true for many other isolates, including
laboratory fixed strains and street rabies virus strains.
Thus, a conclusion can be drawn that the psdudogene is
only part of non-translated region of G mRNA.

It is assumed that the aG strain in China is more closely with rabies virus in northern and northeast part of
China, since these strains are closely related geographically and ethnically. The phylogenetic tree based on the
N gene showed that aG strain clustered with the Japanese vaccine strain, supporting the idea that rabies virus
from the same region tend to cluster together.
Consistent with previous observations that viruses
from the same geographical area tend to group together,
the aG strain tends to cluster most closely with DRV,
which was isolated from deer in Jilin province, China.
Also, the aG strain grouped closely to other vaccine
strain, especially the vaccine strain from Japan [20].
However, the aG strain did not share high nucleotide
homology with wild strain, such as FJ008, FJ009 and
HN10, making aG not the best vaccine in China [21],
although the strain aG has been employed for human
vaccine strain in China for a long time. Of course, more
research is needed to confirm the hypothesis.
To date, several methods, such as rapid amplification of
cDNA (RACE) [22-24] and gene-walking approach have
been employed to obtain the whole genome sequence,
including the 5’ and 3’ untranslated regions (UTR). In the
present study, a simple method of amplification and
sequencing of full length of rabies virus genome was performed, according to reference 7. Before this study, similar method has been used to sequence the genome of
different viruses [25]. Compared with the method previously, the method described here is easy to perform,
does not need complex principle and does not need
expensive device; thus it is recommended for other virus.
Comparison of nucleotide sequences of rabies virus
available in Genbank with aG strain showed extensive
divergence excluding the transcription regulatory signals
and limited stretches of the nucleotide. However,
according to the phylogenetic analysis of the N gene of
aG strain, the strain probably emerged from the DRV,
or they may share the same ancestor, which was isolated
deer in Jilin province, China. More researches are
needed to determine whether the aG strain came originally as a result of the DRV adapting to the dog host or
not. The Ser389, the putative casein-type phosphorylation
site and regulation of viral RNA transcription and replication was conserved in strain aG. The antigenic sites in
strain aG were conserved, indicating the antigenicity of
aG was well retained, which was suitable for vaccine
production.

P has been considered to be the most divergent of the
five coding protein. The LC8-interacting motif was conserved in aG strain, indicating that the motif serve to
transport the virus through neurons. Also, the L-binding
region of P, as well as the N-binding site of P was also
conserved, except Thr174, Glu295. These results, together
with the five Ser and four Met, indicating that the same

function which have been reported in fixed strains were
also retained in aG strain. Mebatsion and Rasalingam
questioned the function of the interaction between P
and LC8 by constructing of recombinant virus in the
absence of the LC8 binding site. The results indicated
that the virus lacking the binding site was as pathogenic
as wild virus, suggesting the interaction is not indispensible to the spread of RV.
M protein has been considered to be important in
membrane budding and interacting with cellular components. Finke found that substitution of Arg58 to Gly58
reduced the expression of full-length RNA. The aG
strain retains the Glu58, suggesting that it may serve to
RNA regulation.
The G protein is related to cell attachment, responsible
for the induction of neutralizing antibodies and cellmediated immune response [26]. Ala242, Asp255, Ile268, and
Arg333, which are correlated with pathogenicity of rabies
virus, were encoded Cys, Met, Thr and Ala respectively.
The antigenic sites were all retained in aG. These results
suggest the antigenicity of G protein was retained. However,
the strain aG was strongly attenuated, although other factors may be responsible for the pathogenicity of rabies virus.
The L protein, together with P compose RNA polymerase complex, which is involved in enzymic activities
of polymerase. The RNA-binding region, active site of
polymerase, the Pro residues rich motif GXGXG, which
is involved in polyadenylation or protein kinase activities, were conserved; These motifs, together with GHP
were conserved in strain aG. All These results suggest

the L protein possess the same function as other strain.
However, little is known about the mechanism of the
function of L protein, therefore, more researches are
needed and necessary.

Conclusion
In this report, we analyzed the full genome of China
human rabies vaccine strain aG. Our studies indicated
that the genome of aG retained the basic characteristics

Jiao et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:521
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/521

of RV, including the organization of the genome, the
functional domains of the each ORF. At gene level, N
was the most conserved among the five coding genes,
indicating We this gene is the most appropriate for
quantitative genotype definition. The phylogenetic analysis of the N indicated the aG strain clustered most closely with Japanese and Russian rabies vaccine strains,
suggesting that they may share the same ancestor; also,
the aG strain did not share high homology with wild
strains isolated from China, making it may not be the
best vaccine strain, more research is needed to elucidate
the genetic relationship among the RV circulating in
China.
