Abstract
Background: The major royal jelly proteins/yellow (MRJP/YELLOW) family possesses several
physiological and chemical functions in the development of Apis mellifera and Drosophila
melanogaster. Each protein of the family has a conserved domain named MRJP. However, there is
no report of MRJP/YELLOW family proteins in the Lepidoptera.
Results: Using the YELLOW protein sequence in Drosophila melanogaster to BLAST silkworm EST
database, we found a gene family composed of seven members with a conserved MRJP domain each
and named it YELLOW protein family of Bombyx mori. We completed the cDNA sequences with
RACE method. The protein of each member possesses a MRJP domain and a putative cleavable
signal peptide consisting of a hydrophobic sequence. In view of genetic evolution, the whole Bm
YELLOW protein family composes a monophyletic group, which is distinctly separate from
Drosophila melanogaster and Apis mellifera. We then showed the tissue expression profiles of Bm
YELLOW protein family genes by RT-PCR.
Conclusion: A Bombyx mori YELLOW protein family is found to be composed of at least seven
members. The low homogeneity and unique pattern of gene expression by each member among
the family ensure us to prophesy that the members of Bm YELLOW protein family would play some
important physiological functions in silkworm development.

Background
Major royal jelly proteins and YELLOW proteins in
Insecta, together with an orphan protein found in Deinococcus radiodurans, a radiation tolerant bacterium, form a
protein family named the MRJP/YELLOW family [1,2].
Major royal jelly proteins (MRJPs) are initially identified
as the major content of royal jelly (RJ) proteins, constitut-

ing 80%–90% of the total RJ proteins which play a central
role in the honeybee development [3]. A recent report
indicates that MRJP/YELLOW protein family in Apis mellifera includes at least 8 MRJPs (named MRJP1-8) and two
homologues of the Drosophila YELLOW proteins, Am-YELLOW and Am-YELLOW-f [2]. Most MRJPs have the characteristic that there are repetitive segments encoding long

homopetptides at the carboxyl terminal. The structure is
thought of as the accessible form of storing nutrition [4].
Apis mellifera MRJP/YELLOW proteins may have higher
physiological functions because at least one of the members expresses in the brain's mushroom body of the honeybee [5]. At the N-terminal of MRJP/YELLOW protein,
there is a strong hydrophobic sequence functioning as
putative signal peptide [6]. It should be noted that the
term MRJP was created before knowing their physicochemical properties. Later it was established that these
proteins have physico-chemical properties similar to
those of ovalbumin (storage egg-white protein) or serum
albumin (major protein of serum) which are typical albunoid proteins and therefore researchers have proposed to
rename major royal jelly proteins as apalbumins. Thus,
apalbumin-1 will be designated as MRJP1, apalbumin-2
as MRJP2, and so on. This new terminology of honeybee
larval diet proteins corresponds with reality that these
proteins are presented not only in royal jelly, but also in
worker and drone jellies [7].
The Drosophila yellow gene is related to normal larval and
adult pigmentation and movement, and the mating
behavior of male and female [8-10]. It encodes a simple
transcription unit of two exons, encoding a 541 aa protein. Further researches indicate several novel Drosophila
genes possessing a high identical MRJP conserved domain
are termed as the yellow family [1]. With the achievement
of the Drosophila melanogaster genome-sequencing project
[11], the Drosophila melanogaster yellow gene family has
grown to a total of more than 14 genes [12]. The Drosophila melanogaster yellow-y and ebony genes together
determine the degree of melanization and its pattern [13].
The yellow-f and yellow-f2 genes have dopachrome-conversion enzyme activity that likely playing an important role
during melanin biosynthesis in Drosophila melanogaster
larvae, pupae and adults [14]. Furthermore, MRJP-like
protein was also found and identified in the blood-sucking insect, possessing an agglutinin activity and probably
intermediating in the evolution from yellow-like function
towards royal jelly components [15].
To date, no related protein has been found in the noninsect metazoans except the orphan protein in the red pigmented bacterium D. radiodurans with 59% similarity to
the Drosophila Yellow protein [16]. However, there is no
report of a MRJP/YELLOW family protein in the Lepidoptera. With the declaration of the completion of EST library
[17,18] and the achievement of genome sequence draft
project [19,20] in Bombyx mori, the silkworm, as a model
organism has been attracting more scientists. We searched
the silkworm EST library by the BLAST method and found
eight partial MRJP/YELLOW family genes in Bombyx mori.
Using the SMART™ RACE Amplification method we completed seven of the cDNA sequences. The nucleotide acid

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/195

and amino acid structures of the genes were analyzed, and
the tissue expression profiles and phylogenetic analysis
were also studied.

Results
Identification of Bm YELLOW protein family in the EST
library
We obtained 74 ESTs of different length from the silkworm EST library, using the conserved domain in Yellow
protein of Drosophila melanogaster to BLAST. We grouped
and combined these sequences using the programs of
DNASTAR and CLUSTAL X software packages. Seven Bm
YELLOW protein family genes (GenBank: DQ358079–
DQ358085) (Table 1) each contained a MRJP conserved
domain were gained.
Sequence analysis in Bm YELLOW protein family
Bm-yellow-d
The biggest group consisted of 21 ESTs derived from midgut, wing discs, ovary, fat body and pheromone gland.
The assembled contig contained 1,510 nucleotide acids
with incomplete 3'-terminal. Primers (Table 2) were
designed depending on the assembled sequence, and 3'RACE was performed using midgut cDNA as the template.
Then the obtained 3'-RACE product was combined with
the assembled contig and named Bm-yellow-d. The
sequence of Bm-yellow-d was 1,678 bp long, containing an
open reading frame of 1,341 bp encoding a protein 446
amino acids long. The stop codon was located 159 bp
upstream of the poly (A) tail and no usual polyadenylation (AAUAAA) signal was found. The first 24 amino acids
of the protein made a putative signal peptide and the location between amino acid residue 122 and residue 412 was
the MRJP conserved domain.

The sequence of the Bm-yellow-d cDNA was almost completely
covered
by
the
sequence
(GenBank:
AADK01006220, AADK01006404, AADK01009017)
readings from shotgun sequencing of the silkworm
genome. This enabled us to identify the 6 introns in the
genomic locus of Bm-yellow-d. Considering the incompleteness of the fifth intron, two primers (5'-gtttccaacgtgggaagactta, 5'-cgagaaacgtcgatactgtgtt) for PCR were
designed basing on known sequences (GenBank:
AADK01006404, AADK01009017), to complete the
genomic sequence of Bm-yellow-d. Surprisingly, we got
several amplification products of different sizes and the
sequencing results showed that there might be an extensively high repeat area.
Bm-yellow-fa
Fifteen ESTs from pheromone gland, fat body or embryo
were combined in an assembled contig 1,274 bp long
absent 3'-terminal. After combined with the 3'-RACE
product from pheromone gland, a 1,543 bp cDNA was

gained and named Bm-yellow-fa. Bm-yellow-fa contained
an open reading frame of 1,380 bp encoding a protein
459 amino acids long. The stop codon was located 164 bp
upstream of the poly (A) tail, 31 bp upstream of which
was a consensus polyadenylation signal (AAUAAA). A
putative signal peptide was found in the first 17 amino
acids of the protein. The complete MRJP conserved region
stretched from residues 168 to 456.

genomic locus of Bm-yellow-fb contained 8 introns.
Bm-yellow-b
The EST from pheromone gland (GenBank: BP183406)
656 bp long fell in the smallest contig. We got a long 3'RACE product from pheromone gland and assembled it
with the EST sequence, and obtained the 2,045 bp Bm-yellow-b gene. The gene contained an open reading frame of
1,374 bp, encoding a protein 457 amino acids long with
a putative signal peptide in the first 26 amino acids and a
MRJP conserved domain spanning 135–413 amino acid
residues. The stop codon was located 640 bp upstream of
the poly (A) tail, and a consensus polyadenylation signal
(AAUAAA) was located only 12 bp upstream of the tail.

Bm-yellow-f2
Two ESTs from ovary and brain composed an assembled
contig 731 bp long. The 3'-terminal fragment was
obtained by 3'-RACE from ovary and combined with the
former assembled contig, composing the cDNA of Bm-yellow-f2, which was 1,130 bp long. Bm-yellow-f2 cDNA contained an open reading frame of 855 bp, encoding a
protein 284 amino acids long with a putative signal peptide in the first 17 amino acids and an incomplete MRJP
conserved region spanning 125–216 amino acid residues.
The stop codon was located 259 bp upstream of the poly

conclude that at least 5 introns were contained in the
genomic locus of Bm-yellow-f2.
Bm-yellow
A 1,045 bp assembled contig consisted of 10 ESTs from
compound eye, pheromone gland, ovary and fat body was
named Bm-yellow. With the result of 3'-RACE, we got a
cDNA of 1,947 bp contained a complete open reading
frame, encoding a protein of 514 amino acids. A putative
signal peptide was found in the first 18 amino acids and a
MRJP conserved domain was located from 115 to 399
amino acid residues. The stop codon was located 373 bp
upstream of the poly (A) tail, and a consensus polyadenylation signal (AAUAAA) was found located 17 bp
upstream of the poly (A) tail.

Shotgun sequence readings of the silkworm Genome
(GenBank: BAAB01161029, AADK01014604) covered
partial of the Bm-yellow cDNA. It showed that no less than
3 introns were in the genomic locus of Bm-yellow.
Alignment and phylogeny of Bm YELLOW protein family
proteins
Homology alignment was performed between the YELLOW protein families of Drosophila melanogaster and Bombyx mori at amino acid sequence level. The result showed
that Bm-YELLOW-d shared the highest identity with YELLOW-d2 among Drosophila melanogaster YELLOWfamily
(38.8%). Bm-YELLOW-fa and Bm-YELLOW-fb both
shared the highest identity with YELLOW-f (42.9% and
35.1%, respectively), while Bm-YELLOW-f2 shared with
YELLOW-f2 (21.1%). Bm-YELLOW-c shared the highest
identity with YELLOW-c (50.5%), and Bm-YELLOW-b was
the most similar to YELLOW-b with an identity of 23%.
Bm-YELLOW was mostly homologous to Drosophila melanogaster YELLOW (51.2%).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/195

The protein sequences of the Bm YELLOW protein family,
with Dm-YELLOW and Am-YELLOW, were aligned using
the CLUSTAL X software package and modified by GeneDoc software (Figure 1). The homology existed in the
MRJP conserved domain of all the Bm-YELLOW family
genes, but its similarity was lower than that of the Apis
mellifera MRJP/YELLOW protein family and the Drosophila
melanogaster YELLOW protein family. For example,
though Bm-YELLOW-fa and Bm-YELLOW-fb shared the
highest identity, it was only 41.3%. Surprisingly, some
unique amino acid sequences were found in the members
of the Bm YELLOW protein family such as residues 53 to
106 in Bm-YELLOW-fa, 26 to 33 in Bm-YELLOW-b and the
C-terminal of Bm-YELLOW-d and Bm-YELLOW-b. The
above information indicated that complicated divergence
existed in the Bm YELLOW protein family.
The phylogenetic tree was calculated from the aligned protein sequences using the neighbor-joining (NJ) method
(Figure 2). The Bombyx mori YELLOW protein family, Apis
mellifera YELLOW and Drosophila YELLOW formed three
monophyletic groups independently. In the Bm YELLOW
protein family group, Bm-YELLOW underwent the earliest
divergence within the family.Bm-YELLOW-c, Bm-YELLOW-fa, Bm-YELLOW-fb and Bm-YELLOW-f2 might be
classified into one paraphyletic sub-group. The other paraphyletic sub-group included Bm-YELLOW-d and BmYELLOW-b. The protein distance analysis showed that
there was moderation support for an earliest divergence of
Bm-YELLOW among the known members. The results of
phylogenetic analyses showed that the Bm YELLOW protein family genes clearly formed a monophyletic group
distant from Apis mellifera and Drosophila melanogaster.
Tissue expression patterns of Bm YELLOW protein family
The RT-PCR was done to analyze tissue specific expression
patterns of the Bm YELLOW protein family genes on the
3rd and the 8th days (matured silkworm) of the 5th instar
larvae (Figure 3). The tissues included head, wing discs,
midgut, silk glands, fat body, malpighian tubules, body
wall, hemocyte, trachea, and gonads (testis and ovary).
Bm-yellow-d and Bm-yellow-b were transcripted in all the
tissues, therein a low expression was observed of Bm-yellow-d in silk glands and Bm-yellow-b in the testis of
matured silkworm.Bm-yellow-fa was obviously found not
expressed in hemocyte. Notably high levels of Bm-yellow-c
transcripts were readily detectable in all tissues except
hemocyte. Bm-yellow-fb was not found in malpighian
tubules, midgut and silk glands but found in others. Bmyellow-f2 was only expressed in head, wing discs, body
wall, pheromone gland and trachea. Bm-yellow, which was
most similar to Dm-yellow, was expressed in most of the
organs studied in the experiment. But it was hardly detectable in malpighian tubules, silk glands, fat body and body

wall. We would note that even all of the numbers of Bmyellow family had high expression level in gonads.

We obtained seven genes coding proteins each contains a
conserved MRJP domain from the present silkworm EST
library and named the silkworm YELLOW protein family
genes. Each protein in the family possessed a putative
cleavable signal peptide composed of a hydrophobic
sequence, 17 to 26 residues long at the N-terminal, and a
MRJP conserved domain. In the SilkDB [21,22], seven
genes predicted from the silkworm genome draft
sequence, each possess a putative MRJP conserved
domain have been named as Bmb004831, Bmb006279,
Bmb006279, Bmb010554, Bmb026342, Bmb030806,
and Bmb033954. However, our results are different from
theirs.
For the confidence of Bm YELLOW protein family members, we designed primer1 and primer2 based on the EST
sequences that included 5' non-coding region except Bmyellow-d. In order to validate the assemblage of Bm-yellowd, we designed two primers containing complete coding
region (5'-atgtcgtacggaatcgagcgat-3' and 5'-ctacagaaatgacacagcgcc-3'), and successfully cloned the entire open
reading frame from the midgut cDNA. The length of Bmyellow-f2 gene was the shortest and its MRJP conserved
domain was truncated. But the search of its genomic
sequence revealed that contig027742 (GenBank:

AADK01027742) covered all the sequence of the last exon
(at the nucleotide acid site from 747 to 1,140). All the
above results proved the credibility of the seven cloned
Bm YELLOW protein genes.
The Apis mellifera MRJP/YELLOW family and the Drosophila melanogaster YELLOW family resulted from a series
of events of a duplication and subsequent divergence [6].
What analysis of cDNA sequence and genomic structure of
Bm YELLOW protein family genes of the silkworm demonstrated are as follows: on one hand, the seven complete
members encoding various lengths of amino acids, 284 to
514 long, contained stretches of unique amino acid
sequences in their coding regions; on the other hand,
some of the 0–12 introns included extensive repeat
sequences. But only 1–3 introns were included in the 14
yellow family members of Drosophila melanogaster. We
assumed that the Bm YELLOW protein family also originated in the same manner, but the evolutionary procedure was more complex than that in Drosophila and Apis.
Nothing has been reported on the cloning and function of
lepidopteran YELLOW protein family until recently. From
the tissue expression profiles, we found that all the seven
genes of the Bm YELLOW protein family were transcripted
in head, wing discs, body wall and gonads (testis and
ovary). As Bm-yellow-d and Bm-yellow-b were observed in
every tissue and possessed similar tissue expression patterns, they were also classified into a paraphyletic subgroup in the phylogenetic tree. Then we could speculate
that Bm-yellow-d and Bm-yellow-b had important roles in
silkworm development and had similar physiological
functions. The Bm-yellow-fa, Bm-yellow-fb and Bm-yellow-f2
had a similar distribution in the tissue expression profiles
and had the best similarity to Drosophila yellow-f and yellow-f2 which had the dopachrome-conversion enzyme
activity. In addition, the three members were classified
into a paraphyletic sub-group in the phylogenetic tree.
These indicated that Bm-yellow-fa, Bm-yellow-fb and Bmyellow-f2 might have functions in pigmentation. Preliminary experiments showed that appearance of the pupa was
dark black, similar to the phenotype of black pupa due to
the over expression of Bm-yellow-d in pupal stage via a
weakened pathogenic baculoviral Expression system (see
Additional file 1). This indicated that Bm-yellow-d might
be in a close relation with cuticle pigmentation too. The
function of Drosophila YELLOW members is relative to
reproduction, and studies showed that yellow-g and yellowg2 in Drosophila playing a female-specific role in egg development [23]. All the members of the Bm YELLOW protein
family had a high transcription level in ovary and testis.
This suggested that Bm YELLOW protein family were also
involved to the reproduction.

Conclusion
Bombyx mori YELLOW protein family is the first reported
MRJP/YELLOW family to date in the Lepidoptera. It is
composed of at least seven members each has one MRJP
domain. The low identity of their signal peptides and their
MRJP conserved domains, and the highly diversity in
cDNA and genomic structure and also unique tissue
expression patterns indicated that the members of Bm
YELLOW protein family might have various functions in
the silkworm development.

Methods
Insects and tissue dissection
The silkworm stock Jingsong×Haoyue is maintained in
our laboratory. The insects were reared on artificial diet at
25°C with 70%–80% relative humidity. Tissues were dissected out at proper developmental stages for the experiments.
Database searching and sequence assembly
The protein sequence of Drosophila melanogaster yellow
(GenBank: AAF45497) was used to BLAST Bombyx mori
EST database [24]. The obtained sequences were associated and catalogued by the use of DNASTAR software
package [25] and CLUSTAL X software package [26]. The
conserved domain was speculated by the Internet server
[27] and the signal peptide was speculated through the
SignalP 3.0 Server program [28]. The genomic DNA
sequence was searched from the insect genomes with
Bombyx-limited [29].
3'-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (3'-RACE) and DNA
sequencing
Total RNA was isolated from tissues using TRIZOL Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the standard protocol. All
RNA samples were treated with Rnase free Dnase
(Promega), and evaluated in agarose gels to ensure that
they contained intact rRNA and were free of DNA contamination.

One microgramme of total RNA extracted from different
tissues at given stages was used for 3'-RACE cDNA synthesis (BD SMART™ RACE cDNA Amplification Kit, Clontech), according to the user manual. PCR was performed
with primer1 and Universal Primer A Mix (UPM, Clontech), then a nest PCR was used with primer2 and NUP
using the suitable diluted former PCR product as the template. Each PCR reaction was carried out under the following conditions; after denaturing for 5 min at 95°C,
subsequent cooling on ice and addition of Taq DNA
polymerase, PCR was performed 30 cycles of 94°C for 1
min, 60°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 1–2 min, followed by
10 min incubation at 72°C. Primers used for 3'-RACE
were listed in Table 2.

The PCR products were separated on agarose gel by electrophoresis, purified and ligated into pMD18-Tvector
(Takara). Several clones were sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide method with ABI-3730 automatic sequencer.
DNA sequences were analyzed using DNASTAR and
CLUSTAL X software packages.

which is driven by polyhedrin promoter as the control; C. Injected a weak
hybridization baculovirus which contained the Bm-yellow-d gene is
driven by ie-1 promoter and hr3 enhancer expression cassette in the pupa
at early stage. From the pictures we could find that the pupa in C is darkened comparing with the controls (A & B). It is known that the Drosophila yellow gene is related to normal larval and adult pigmentation,
so we thought that the darkness of the pupa in C might be caused by the
abundant expression of Bm-yellow-d. But we want to declare that the
present results are preliminary, and further work is doing in our lab to
prove the deduction.

The yellow-like family gene cDNAs obtained in Bombyx
mori were submitted to the GenBank under the accession
numbers listed in Table 1.
Protein sequences alignment and phylogenetic analysis
Yellow-like protein sequences were aligned and saved as
PHYLIP format with CLUSTALX software package. Then a
neighbor-joining (NJ) tree based on amino acid
sequences was constructed by PHYLIP software package
(100 bootstrap replicates).
RT-PCR
Two microgrammes of total RNA of the different tissues at
proper stages were used to synthesize cDNAs according to
the Reverse Transcription kit's protocol (Promega Cat.:
A3500). Using the reverse transcription products as the
templates, 30 cycles of amplification were performed in
all the members of Bm YELLOW protein family with specific primers listed in Table 2. At the same time, the amplification of Bm-actin A3 cDNA (25 cycles) was used as a
standardization control. The PCR products were separated
on 1.5% agarose gel by electrophoresis.
