Background
Jatropha curcas is a drought resistant shrub native in
tropical America, now widely grown in many tropical
and subtropical regions for biodiesel production [1].
First reports on virus infections in Jatropha indicated
the occurrence of viruses closely related to Cassava
mosaic virus in India, reaching a disease incidence from
25 to 47%. This might represent a major constrain to
the production of Jatropha in large scale [2]. The genome of Cassava mosaic geminiviruses (CMG) consist of
two components termed DNA A and DNA B (~ 2.7 –
3.0 kb) [3]. Furthermore, Jatropha has been described as
host of Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) [2].
Methods
In this study we attempted to detect and molecularly
characterize viruses infecting Jatropha in Eastern Africa
(Kenya and Ethiopia). Detection methods will be valuable tools for early screening of plant viruses in order to
make appropriate decisions and selection of planting
material.
A total of 127 Jatropha samples from Ethiopia and
Kenya (districts: Kakamega, Siaya, Busia and Nakuru
showing typical virus symptoms and symptomless plants
were used in this study. ELISA was performed to detect
the presence of three RNA viruses: CMV, Cassava common mosaic virus (CsCMV) and Cassava brown streak
virus (CBSV). PCR was performed using newly designed
primers based on multiple alignments of full length
DNA A sequences of geminiviruses available in the
NCBI Genbank, reported to infect either Jatropha or
cassava. This allowed to amplify the variable regions of

Resources and Life Sciences, Muthgasse 18, 1190 Vienna, Austria

full length (2800 bp) and shorter sequences (380-1085
bp). PCR products were sequenced. A phylogenetic tree
was constructed from multiple alignments by performing a heuristic search. Multiple alignments were analyzed by maximum parsimony with full-length DNA A
using Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony (PAUP)
and a bootstrap analysis with 1000 replicates.

Results and conclusions
None of the Jatropha samples analysed was infected
with the RNA viruses CBSV, CMV and CsCMV. PCR
primers amplifying a 380 bpfragment of AC1, AC2 and
AC3 yielded positive results with 75% of the symptomatic samples from Kenya and further detected 20% of
asymptomatic samples as positive. Furthermore, 61% of
symptomatic Jatropha samples from Ethiopia were positive. Full length primers were able to detect 69% symptomatic Jatropha samples from Kenya, and also in 67%
of asymptomatic samples. PCR analyses of sample K1J5
amplified the expected 2.8 kb of a near full length DNA
A component of the Begomovirus sequence and an
additional shorter fragment.
Complete nucleotide sequences of 34 DNA A components typical of Begomoviruses were determined in the
Kenyan samples. Thirty three sequences ranged from
2770 bp to 2816 bp while one (K1J5) consisted only of
1416 bp and termed as a defective (Def) DNA. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that the defective molecule
belongs to geminiviruses involved in CMG, representing
a Def from DNA A of the bipartite Begomovirus
ACMV. All viruses characterized in this study grouped
with two previously identified Begomoviruses found in
cassava in Western Kenya, namely EACMV – UG and
ACMV. The Def DNA showed 96.6% sequence identity

with the ACMV reference sequence [GenBank
NC001467.1].
In this study, we report for the first time the detection
of Begomovirus: ACMV and EACMV – UG in Jatropha
from Kenya. From an evolutionary perspective, the phylogenetic data indicate that the virus isolates from the
study were closely related to those isolated previously in
Western Kenya from cassava [4,5]. Recombination and
synergism that have long occurred in cassava [6,7] could
have led to the recent spread of the virus in the field to
infect Jatropha. Presence of EACMV – UG and ACMV
on different Jatropha plants in the same field indicates
the opportunity for mixed infections, hence offering
good opportunities for more recombination to occur.
EACMV – UG and ACMV are associated with severe
synergistic epidemics on cassava. Synergism lead to a 10
- 50 fold increase in viral DNA accumulation which
substantially increases the potential for a higher efficiency of vector transmission to even infect non cassava
host plants [6,7]. This explain why EACMV - UG is the
predominant virus in Jatropha. The deletions occurring
in the Def DNA found in the study might affect the
replication of the molecule and it might depend entirely
on its helper virus for replication.
There is a possibility of Cassava mosaic virus in Jatropha being more wide spread than anticipated, since we
have detected it also in Jatropha samples from Ethiopia.
