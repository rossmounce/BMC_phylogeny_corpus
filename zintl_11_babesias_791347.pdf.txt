Babesias of red deer (Cervus elaphus) in Ireland
Annetta Zintl1, Eugene J Finnerty2, Thomas M Murphy3, Theo de Waal1, Jeremy S Gray2*

Abstract
Blood samples were obtained from 38 wild red deer (Cervus elaphus) at two sites in Ireland and subjected to PCR
analysis of the 18S rRNA gene followed by sequencing. Two fragments of the 18S rRNA gene were generated by
two different PCR protocols and subsequent sequencing suggested that at least six of the deer were infected by a
babesia that, in those loci, is indistinguishable from Babesia divergens, an important tick-borne pathogen of cattle
and of zoonotic significance. Additionally, a B. odocoilei-like parasite was detected in three samples and a babesia
that did not match any sequences in the GenBank database was found in five samples. Neither B. capreoli nor B.
venatorum (EU1) were found. There have been several reports of B. divergens occurring in deer species, including
red deer, roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and reindeer (Rangifer tarandus). However, in view of recent re-sequencing
of bovine-origin samples deposited previously in GenBank, it is unlikely that any of these sequences from deer are
B. divergens. The present study describes the only deer piroplasm detected so far that shows complete identity
with B. divergens, in just over half of the 18S rRNA gene. The entire gene of this deer parasite should be analysed
and transmission experiments undertaken before the infectivity of B. divergens for red deer can be confirmed.
Introduction
There has been considerable recent interest in the identity of Babesia spp. in deer, because of concerns about
the health of endangered host species such as chamois
(Rupicapra r. rupicapra) [1] and also because of the
possibility of deer acting as reservoirs for important cattle parasites such as Babesia divergens [2]. Earlier studies on red (Cervus elaphus) and sika (C. nippon) deer
babesias in Europe suggested that they were morphologically and antigenically indistinguishable from B. divergens, but were not transmissible to splenectomised
calves. They were therefore tentatively identified as
B. capreoli [3,4], which was first observed in roe deer
(Capreolus capreolus) [5]. With the advent of molecular
taxonomy based on analysis of DNA sequences, several
authors described parasites in roe, red or reindeer as B.
divergens or B. divergens-like [2,6-12]. These authors
based their conclusions on 18S rRNA gene sequence
alignment, but none of their samples showed 100% similarity with B. divergens sequences of bovine origin in
GenBank. Resequencing of the 18S rRNA gene from the
same strains of B. divergens originally deposited in GenBank showed that all were in fact identical and that

there were errors in the original sequences (Slemenda
et al., unpublished, cited in [13]). This suggests that
parasites showing less than 100% similarity for this gene
should not be designated B. divergens and to date there
are no studies showing that B. divergens occurs naturally
in ruminant hosts other than cattle.
An opportunity to re-examine this situation arose during a serosurvey of deer parasites in free-ranging wild
Irish deer. Blood samples from 38 red deer from two
National Parks in different geographical locations were
analysed by two PCR protocols targeting the 18S rRNA
gene, and the products then sequenced and aligned for
identification purposes.

Materials and methods
Blood samples were collected from red deer shot by the
National Parks and Wildlife Service as part of the seasonal cull in Glenveagh (n = 27) and Killarney (n = 11)
(Figure 1). From each animal 3 to 4 mL whole blood
were collected into EDTA. Following centrifugation and
removal of plasma, the packed cell component was
stored at -20°C. DNA was subsequently extracted from
thawed and mixed 100 mg packed cells of each sample
using the High Pure PCR Template Preparation Kit
(Roche, Burgess Hill, UK). A nested PCR protocol was
used initially to screen all samples (protocol I). The
positive samples were then additionally analysed using a

extracted from a bovine isolate was used as a positive
control. Negative controls were performed in the
absence of template DNA. PCR products were fractionated on 2% agarose gels and visualised by staining with
SYBR Safe DNA gel stain (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK).
Amplicons were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Crawley, UK) and sequenced
(GATC Biotech AG, Konstanz, Germany). Consensus
sequences were obtained from between 5 to 14 forward
and 2 reverse sequences, each. Comparisons were made
with published sequences using NCBI Blast, aligned
with the ClustalW2 sequence alignment programme and
logged in GenBank under accession numbers GU475472
to GU475475. Because of insufficient sequence overlap
at the 5’end, logged sequences are approximately 40 bp
shorter than the amplicons.
Phylogenetic analysis of the relationship between
sequences of our isolates and published sequence data
was carried out using MEGA version 3.1 [14]. This software programme was used to construct a NeighbourJoining tree. Tree reliability was assessed by the bootstrap method with 1000 pseudoreplicates.

protocols target different regions of the 18S rRNA gene
and are modifications of previous published assays.
Details are provided in Table 1. B. divergens DNA

Results
The initial screen using PCR protocol I revealed that 18
deer carried Babesia spp. infections (26%), with 17 originating from Glenveagh and 1 from Killarney (Table 2).
The Babesia species present in these animals were identified by sequence-analysis of fragments amplified using
both PCR protocols. Six samples from Glenveagh
showed 100% similarity to B. divergens (GenBank
AY046576) in both fragments of the 18S rRNA gene

(logged in GenBank under accession numbers
GU475472 (PCR protocol I) and GU475473 (protocol
II)). In a further five isolates one amplicon (resulting
either from PCR protocol I or II) showed 100% B. divergens similarity, although the second amplicon could only
be identified to genus level. In addition, identical nested
PCR products (amplified using protocol I) from three
Glenveagh deer samples were 98% similar to B. odocoilei
(GenBank AY046577) and have been logged as
GU475474. Five products from PCR protocol II (4 from
Glenveagh and 1 from Killarney) were also identical to
each other but did not closely match any Babesia species in the GenBank database (96% similarity with
B. divergens, B. odocoilei and EU1) (accession number
GU475475) (Table 2). Figure 2 shows the phylogenetic
positions of the amplicons arising from PCR protocol I,
which proved to be more discriminating than PCR protocol II. The latter protocol generated amplicons that
did not differentiate bovine-origin B. divergens from any
of the B. divergens-like species, but showed that the
unknown Babesia sp. is clearly separate from B. divergens, B. odocoilei and B. venatorum (Figure 3). The
remaining positive PCR amplicons could only be identified to Babesia genus level due to poor sequencing data.

Discussion
Reports of the identification of B. divergens in reindeer
[8], roe deer [2,6,9,12], red deer [2] and chamois [1]
were noteworthy because this parasite is not only an
important pathogen of cattle but is also zoonotic, causing a dangerous fulminating disease in splenectomised
patients [15,16]. The presence of B. divergens in freeranging wild deer would affect our understanding of
both bovine and human babesiosis epidemiology. However, reliance on similarity of fragments of the 18S
rRNA gene for identification of this parasite is questionable. Although this gene is of great taxonomic value
within the Apicomplexa, it has been suggested that it
may not discriminate well between very closely related
parasites [11]. Furthermore, few of the recent studies on
babesia in European deer analysed the whole gene, or
attempted infection with deer parasites of splenectomised cattle or gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus), both of
which infections are reliable markers for B. divergens
identity [16]. The most complete sequences analysed
were from babesias in farmed reindeer in Scotland [8]
and from roe deer in Slovenia [2]. In both these studies
it was concluded that the high level of similarity (99.8
and 99.6% respectively) when compared with B. divergens GenBank depositions made in the mid-90s
(U16370, UO7885 and Z48751) justified identity with
B. divergens. However, when the whole 18S rRNA gene
from the original B. divergens strains were resequenced,
along with several others, it was found that all were

Zintl et al. Veterinary Research 2011, 42:7
http://www.veterinaryresearch.org/content/42/1/7

identical and the only strain that had been accurately
sequenced among the early GenBank depositions was
U16370 (Slemenda et al., unpublished, cited in [13]).
This calls into question B. divergens identity of any isolates showing less than 100% similarity to U16370.
Although further bovine B. divergens sequence data
were recently deposited in GenBank, these show
only one (EF458223, EF458224, EF458227) or two
(EF458219) base pair differences from the approximately
12 accurate sequences of other B. divergens bovine isolates in the data base. None of the deer-derived babesia
isolates referred to above showed less than four basepair differences and in only one study [8] was an
attempt made to infect gerbils. No infection occurred
but this could have been due to reduced viability of the
parasites resulting from the delay in their arrival at the
laboratory by mail.
The tentative identification of B. divergens in the present study is based on analysis of two fragments of the
18S rRNA gene (bp loci 527-1005 and 1096-1589 in the
bovine origin reference sequence, AY046576), more
than half the total gene of 1728 bp. In the other publications that reported detection of B. divergens and where a
significantly large proportion of the gene was analysed,
base pair differences compared with AY046576 occurred
at the following base pair loci - 632, 663, 1277
(AY098643 [8]); 373, 631, 663, 804, 1365, 1423
(AY572456 [2]), whereas no differences from our
sequences were found at these loci. Schmid et al. [11]
detected B. divergens-like piroplasms with a similar level
of 18S rDNA similarity (99.5% and 99.6%) in roe deer
and chamois. They did not identify these parasites as
B. divergens and suggested they should be regarded as
B. capreoli, although the sequences (EU182596 and
EU182597) do not show 100% 18S rDNA similarity with
this species either (AY726009). It is possible that bovine
B. divergens, which evidently shows negligible variability
in the 18S rRNA gene [13,17], is a variant of deer origin
that has developed specificity for cattle.
In striking contrast to the above three studies, the B.
divergens-like sequences from the present study showed
no differences from bovine B. divergens sequences at
base pair loci 527-1005 and 1096-1589. Whether or not
this parasite is truly identical with bovine B. divergens
requires further study, but this is also the first reliable
demonstration of a B. divergens-like piroplasm (even if
not B. divergens) in red deer because the only previous
study that considered this deer species [2], apparently
did not attempt to sequence the PCR product.
The highest proportion of babesia-infected deer
occurred in the Glenveagh herd and most identifiable
babesia sequences were also obtained from this herd.
Although serology detected antibodies in the majority of
the Killarney samples (unpublished data), no identifiable

Page 5 of 6

amplicons could be generated by PCR. It is not obvious
why these differences occurred. The deer in all the locations were exposed to heavy tick (Ixodes ricinus) challenge judging by the numerous attached ticks observed
at culling.
It is of interest that neither B. capreoli nor B. venatorum were found in the present study. B. capreoli was
first described by Enigk and Friedhoff [5], in roe deer
based primarily on morphology. Adam and Blewett [3],
and Gray et al. [4], tentatively identified parasites isolated from red deer and sika deer respectively as
B. capreoli, based on origin, morphology and antigenicity. In both cases transfer to splenectomised calves
failed to result in infection, suggesting that these parasites were not B. divergens, though in the light of recent
DNA analysis data it seems likely that they were
B. divergens-like parasites. More recently, DNA analysis
by Hoby et al. [7] and Malandrin et al. [18] confirmed
that B. capreoli occurs in roe deer and the former
authors also detected this parasite in chamois and red
deer, though single samples only were positive in these
latter host species. B. venatorum (EU1) first came to
scientific notice as a zoonotic infection [13], and has
since then been firmly associated with roe deer [18,19],
but has not so far been detected in red deer. The apparent absence of both B. capreoli and B. venatorum in the
present study correlates well with the fact that roe deer
do not occur in Ireland [20].
B. odocoilei is a piroplasm of American white-tailed
deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and close relatives of this
parasite have been detected in European ticks (I. ricinus)
by PCR [13,21]. Unfortunately no sequence data are
available from the PCR products of the tick analyses for
comparison with the present study, which appears to be
the first record of such a piroplasm in European deer,
though the B. odocoilei-like parasite detected by Hilpertshauser et al. [22] was in ticks removed from roe deer
and which therefore contained deer blood. One further
sequence in the present study was identifiable as Babesia sp. but did not match any sequence in GenBank.
Since it was identical in samples from five individual
deer, it may represent a new babesia 18S rDNA
sequence.
Analysis of the complete 18S rRNA gene would, of
course, have provided a greater level of confidence in
the identity of the babesias detected in this study.
Unfortunately, available resources did not permit this.
Nevertheless, the gene fragment analysis presented here
suggests that there are at least two Babesia species, if
not three, in the red deer sampled in this study. The significance of these parasites as disease agents is unknown
and further studies, in addition to gene analysis, including isolation of the parasites and transmission studies in
in vitro or in vivo systems are necessary to establish

Zintl et al. Veterinary Research 2011, 42:7

their identities, particularly that of the putative
B. divergens.
