Abstract
Background: Despite the impressive growth of sequence databases, the limited availability of nuclear markers that
are sufficiently polymorphic for population genetics and phylogeography and applicable across various phyla
restricts many potential studies, particularly in non-model organisms. Numerous introns have invariant positions
among kingdoms, providing a potential source for such markers. Unfortunately, most of the few known EPIC (Exon
Primed Intron Crossing) loci are restricted to vertebrates or belong to multigenic families.
Results: In order to develop markers with broad applicability, we designed a bioinformatic approach aimed at
avoiding multigenic families while identifying intron positions conserved across metazoan phyla. We developed a
program facilitating the identification of EPIC loci which allowed slight variation in intron position. From the
Homolens databases we selected 29 gene families which contained 52 promising introns for which we designed 93
primer pairs. PCR tests were performed on several ascidians, echinoderms, bivalves and cnidarians. On average, 24
different introns per genus were amplified in bilaterians. Remarkably, five of the introns successfully amplified in all
of the metazoan genera tested (a dozen genera, including cnidarians). The influence of several factors on
amplification success was investigated. Success rate was not related to the phylogenetic relatedness of a taxon to
the groups that most influenced primer design, showing that these EPIC markers are extremely conserved in
animals.
Conclusions: Our new method now makes it possible to (i) rapidly isolate a set of EPIC markers for any phylum,
even outside the animal kingdom, and thus, (ii) compare genetic diversity at potentially homologous polymorphic
loci between divergent taxa.

Background
Despite the crucial need for genetic markers independent from the non recombining mitochondrial genome,
nuclear markers remain much less used than mitochondrial ones in metazoans (in the Entrez-Nucleotide database, there are about ten times fewer entries containing
“population” and “nuclear marker” or “population” and
“nuclear”, when used as key-words, than entries containing “mitochondrial” instead of “nuclear”). When

choosing molecular genetic markers for a given biodiversity study, two properties, codominance and the possibility of reconstructing evolutionary relationships
among alleles, are generally desirable but are often difficult to obtain [1]. During the last decade, microsatellites
became the most popular codominant markers. However, introns are well known for providing potential
markers variable within species, using EPIC-PCR. EPIC
loci have several advantages compared to microsatellites.
Owing to the position of the primers in conserved
exons, EPICs are potentially applicable across species
and much less prone to null alleles. After sequencing
the variants, evolutionary relationships among alleles
can be inferred much more accurately than for

microsatellites, which are very susceptible to homoplasy
[2]. There is also a less well known but important problem with microsatellites: in some species, most microsatellites appear to belong to the same family (or a small
number of families) of repeated elements; in such cases
codominant genotyping is difficult since the primers
often anneal to multiple paralogous regions ([3,4] and
Chenuil, unpublished).
A recent computer program [5] allows the identification of introns at conserved positions in a species for
which EST sequences are available by comparison with
a related model species for which extensive sequence
information is available (see also [6]). Another study
developed a bioinformatic pipeline to identify EPIC
loci by comparison of two or more whole-genome
sequence datasets, and tested a dozen of these loci by
PCR-sequencing in distantly related teleost fishes [7].
By contrast, our approach is designed to find intron
positions and define primers able to amplify a wider
variety of species from which we may have absolutely
no sequence data.
The positions of introns are extremely conserved during evolution; for instance, 14% of animal introns match
plant intron positions [8,9]. Although this should have
favoured the development of EPIC markers conserved in
different phyla, only half a dozen EPIC loci were proposed by [10] and by [11]. These loci have rarely been
used outside vertebrates (e.g. [12-14]) and in numerous
species none of the tested EPIC loci appeared usable
(e.g. [15]). EPIC loci can be developed specifically for a
given taxon, often using genomic and cDNA sequence
data (e.g. [16,17]; Aurelle et al., submitted). Only vertebrates benefit from a relatively consistent set of EPIC
loci [18,19]. Several reasons for such biases can be
invoked. (1) These “universal” EPIC loci were chosen in
extremely conserved genes, and, not surprisingly, often
appeared to belong to multigenic families, which limited
their use as codominant markers due to simultaneous
amplification of paralogs. (2) Few sequences were available (often none outside vertebrates) to properly define
PCR primers, thus PCR amplifications often failed. (3)
Primers were generally designed considering the nucleotide variation observed in the data set available (often
phylogenetically limited), but ignoring amino-acid conservation and code degeneracy.
Our study was designed to avoid these shortcomings.
We identified putative universal EPIC loci and designed
primers to amplify them in metazoans, taking advantage
of the increased availability of properly annotated, phylogenetically diverse whole-genome sequences. We
actively avoided multigenic families, and used a primer
design strategy aimed at preserving amino-acid
sequences while allowing synonymous codon changes.
For this purpose, we developed dedicated bioinformatic

tools, and then tested all the primer pairs designed in
divergent animal phyla for PCR amplification under
relatively standardized conditions.

Results-Discussion
Potential EPIC loci found in data bases

The number of introns for which we designed and
tested primer pairs was respectively 15 (named between
i1 to i17), 11 (i19 to i35) and 22 (i36 to i58) for stages I,
II and III described in the Methods section (Fig. 1, Fig.
2). Intron numbers are not consecutive because we
could not design satisfactory primer pairs for some
introns that appeared good at the preceding step. In
addition, we designed primers for two genes containing
already known “universal” EPICs: in ATPS-a, one intron
corresponds to the one in Jarman et al (2002) [11] with
slightly different primer sequences, and primers were
designed for an additional intron; in EF1-a, two primer
pairs were designed for each of two introns. The 52
introns came from 29 different gene families and corresponded to 93 primer pairs tested in all species. Surprisingly, a single family was retained from both stages I
and II (so that intron 2 is the same as intron 22). From
the 89 families containing no duplication nodes (i.e. a
node containing the same clusters of taxa several times,
due to gene duplication) isolated during stage I, only six
introns appeared to be present at exactly the same
nucleotide position in 100% of the species, and for only
3 of these, corresponding to EPIC 1, 4 and 5, could we
design satisfactory primer pairs (Fig. 1). Thus, we also
designed primers for some introns that were present in
100% of the deuterostome species in the amino-acid
alignments (i.e. vertebrates and Ciona, no echinoderm
species being available in the Homolens database). For
subsequent stages, intron position was not necessarily
perfectly invariant (see Methods). Fig. 3 displays an
example of the output of the graphical script designed
for stage III. For 36 introns (56 primer pairs out of 93)
we could define a forward and a reverse primer whose
degeneracy did not exceed 8-fold. For 12 of them (22
primer pairs), degeneracy was lower than or equal to 6.
In particular, the primers designed for introns 21, 25,
26, 45, 50 and 54 displayed no more than a 2- or 4-fold
degeneracy (Fig. 1).
Effect of taxonomy on PCR results

For each stage, protein family, and intron, Table 1 and
Table 2 report the results of the PCR for each genus as
observed on agarose gels (Fig. 4) (and the total number
of genera), distinguishing the three quality levels ‘P′(Promising), ‘I’ (Intron-size amplicon) and ‘A’ (Amplification) defined in the Methods section V. The number of
introns producing an amplification product large enough
to contain an intron of at least 70 bp, i.e. pooling the

Figure 1 Primer sequences. Sequences are written using the IUPAC code. We used the following codes to describe the rules that underpinned
primer design: Capital letters represent the 5’clamp (non-degenerate), whereas small letters represent the degenerate part supposed to contain
no mismatch whatever the species (based on known sequences, protein for CH primers or nucleotide for D or NH primers). CHX+Y-z: CodeHop
primer with a 5’clamp (non-degenerate part) of X bases, and a 3’ z-fold degenerate end of Y bases. CHX + Y-z + 2GT: CodeHop primer designed
at the intron limit, which contains the first two bases of the intron (by mistake, we reversed the two bases in the single such case, i8F). DX-Ymz-t: Classical degenerate primer of X bases long, Y-fold degenerate, containing z to t mismatches according to the species (despite degeneracy
in primer design). NHX+Y-Z: We called this a ‘Nucleotide-hop’ primer, by homology with CodeHop primers, but design was based on nucleotide
alignment; we designed a 5’ clamp (non-degenerate) and degenerate the 3’ end according to the set of nucleotide sequences available thus
ignoring codons. NHX+Y-Z-mz-t: Same as above, but, despite primer degeneracy, there may remain mismatches in some species; in this case
there are from z to t mismatches according to the species for which we have sequence data. For instance, a primer (D30-1-m0-2) actually does
not contain ambiguity bases (-1: not degenerate), and contains 0 to 2 mismatches according to the species. Other symbols: * this primer was
not used. # erroneous primer sequence, the subsequently corrected primer i13Rcor was not tried

‘P’ + ‘I’ categories, is rather similar among genera, and
varies from 20 to 30 introns (out of 51 tested), i.e. from
about 40% to 60% of the introns. Some of the factors
likely to generate variation in this value among taxa are:
(i) the number of PCR conditions tested among genera,

(ii) DNA extract quality, (iii) phylogenetic distance of
the taxon from Strongylocentrotus and Ciona, the species
which most influenced primer design, (iv) the molecular
evolutionary rate of the phylum or lineage, and (v) the
average size of introns in the taxon (some taxa tend to

Figure 3 Example of a graphical representation (stage III) of the multiple nucleotide alignment. This tool was introduced at stage III, to
help select conserved regions encompassing introns for PCR primer design. The multiple alignment of the gene family retrieved from Homolens
appears at the top; dots indicate intron occurrence (intron positions are reported in gray at the bottom of the graphic). The similarity score ω
(black), as well as similarity scores with Strongylocentrotus (ω1, green), Saccoglossus (ω2, blue), and Nematostella (ω3, red) are plotted at the
bottom of the graphics; for a better readability, ω1 ... ω3, are halved. Peak of nucleotide conservation and corresponding ω values and positions
on the multiple alignment are identified by vertical lines (a colour code indicates the number of species for which additional sequences were

have large, thus not amplifiable introns, or too small
introns eventually recorded as ‘A’ despite the presence
of an intron). The number of “promising” introns (‘P’)
appears more variable among taxa (from 6 to 15 introns,
i.e. 12% to 29%). Factors causing variation in the proportion of “promising” introns (and which should not
necessarily affect the number of ‘P+I’ introns) may be:
(i) quality of DNA extracts (see below, section 5) since
null PCR may infrequently occur due to bad DNA
extracts and cause a locus in a genus be scored as ‘I’
instead of ‘P’ (even if a single individual of the 4 extracts
tested does not amplify), (ii) variable tendency to display
null alleles (e.g. alleles producing no amplification products) among taxa (a consequence of intrinsic

polymorphism or effective population sizes), and (iii)
genomic features such as the ploidy level or the frequency of transposable elements (causing multiple band
patterns, for instance).
Surprisingly (Fig. 5) we did not observe any clear relationship between phylogeny and global PCR success (i.e.
number of successful loci per genus, whatever the quality level considered as successful), with an average of 22,
23 and 25 introns amplifying (I or P) per genus in
bivalves, ascidians and echinoderms respectively (about
10-12 of which yielded promising ‘P’ patterns in each
group). Some genera belonging to protostome phyla
displayed better results than some deuterostomes. The
cnidarian Corallium, in which only 29 loci instead of

Empty cells correspond to absence of amplification product or occurrence of primer dimer; “na” (not available) corresponds to introns not tested in the
considered genus

52 were surveyed, provided 18 amplifying introns (I +
P). This absence of detectable phylogenetic influence is
probably not an artefact resulting from variation in technical effort since, even when considering only the six
initial species of the standard protocol (Table 3) that
were tested under a larger range of PCR conditions, the
highest variation occurred within phylum (Table 2).
Urochordates and molluscs, for which we applied the
same level of technical effort, display very similar amplification results despite a very different phylogenetic distance relative to species which most influenced primer
design. Despite testing fewer primer pairs on the cnidarians, they display only slightly lower numbers of “P+I”

intron loci than other taxa. Ascidians tend to display
small introns (data not shown, available on request),
consequently cases of null amplifications due to excessively large fragment size are expected to be less numerous, though this may also lead to reporting the absence
of an intron if it is too small (’A’ result instead of an ‘I
or P’). For example, Corella eumyota displays a lower
number of successful loci and smaller intron sizes than
other ascidians.
The absence of a relationship between global success
and phylogenetic position in bilaterians is probably

3’ region of the primer design were generally invariant
in their amino-acid sequences. Therefore, a good predictor for primer matching may be the similarity of the
genome nucleotide composition (influencing codon preference) to the nucleotide composition of the reference
species (Ciona, Strongylocentrotus...); since nucleotide
composition is variable even at low taxonomic levels
(e.g. [20]), the absence of phylogenetic effect is not surprising. The only source of variation is therefore the
degeneracy of the code; this is known to vary greatly
even within species, so focusing on phylum-specific primers may not be useful when very few taxa are available
for a phylum. Actually we have now cloned and
sequenced some of these EPICs in echinoderms and we
nearly always observe variation within species (even
within populations) in the exon sequence (synonymous

changes). However, when the precise pattern at each
intron was considered and the data (from Table 1) were
analysed through a factorial correspondence analysis,
the genera seemed to group according to their phylum
(Fig. 6, see legend for details), illustrating the fact that
some introns are more useful in some phyla than in
others. Within echinoderms, more genera were surveyed, but we did not observe any taxonomic trend,
either comparing ophiuroids versus echinoids, or regular
versus irregular echinoids. Echinoderms appear widely
scattered, by contrast with Urochordates. This may
reflect different genome evolutionary rates of those
phyla though a richer taxonomic sampling is required to
test this hypothesis.
Some gene families appear to be extremely good providers of EPIC markers (Table 4). Remarkably, five
introns, from four different gene families, amplify
intron-sized products (‘P’ or ‘I’) in all the metazoan genera tested (ten to twelve depending on intron) (Table 4).
The previously known universal EPICs tested, ATPS and
EF1, do not belong to these families.
Effect of primer design

The least degenerate primers provided the best results
(Fig. 7, highly significant exact tests) for the primer
pairs composed of two codehop primers (86 cases). This
result was not trivial: if the taxa available in our protein
alignments had not been sufficiently representative of

genera according to their results for each intron. Nulls, A, I and
P were respectively scored as 0,1,2 and 3. Methodological changes
such as (i) adding cnidarians (therefore reducing the number of
variates from 52 to 22 or 29), (ii) considering nulls (scored as 0)
versus all amplifying categories (1) or (iii) changing the nature of
the multivariate analysis did not change the pattern. When included
in analyses, the two cnidarians appeared neither to form a tight
group, nor to be outliers relative to bilaterian phyla. Empty symbols

the diversity of phyla tested–among deuterostomes, for
instance, the Homolens database provided only vertebrates and one urochordate genus–higher amplification
success would have been observed for more degenerate
primers. Despite this significant relationship, some of
the least degenerate introns at the stage of primer
design never amplified (e.g. introns 6, 7, 24 and 49).
Codehop primers seem slightly more efficient than primers designed from nucleotide alignments only, though
this is not statistically significant (additional file 1).
Effects of PCR program and extraction method

Comparisons, for 12 primer pairs, of touch-down and
fixed annealing temperature programs suggest that
touch-down programs are more stringent (less success)
and less prone to produce artefactual additional fragments (higher proportion of ‘P’ patterns) (additional file
1). The two-phase program (tested on 28 primer pairs)
also appears to help (additional file 1). However, we
obtained no statistical support for these effects. Since in
most experiments we used program TD6, our global
results may be improved by using alternative programs.
A strong influence of DNA extraction and/or tissue
storage history, depending on the species, was revealed
(additional file 1).
Obtaining new EPIC loci for any eukaryote lineage

Our method can potentially be applied to obtain new
EPIC loci for any phylogenetic group. Three strategies
can be followed. (i) Using the last version of Homolens,
the famfetch tool, and the graphical tool developed in
this study, one can isolate numerous new EPIC loci,
eventually decreasing the stringency level allowing duplication nodes in some genomes, if numerous loci are
desired. (ii) More simply, one can focus on the gene
families we isolated, and retrieve from protein, nucleotide or EST sequence databases the entries corresponding to the desired lineages; primer pairs should then be
designed following our method. (iii) One can just test
the primer pairs developed in our study (Fig. 1), preferably using several DNA extraction methods, which can
be done in less than 10 working days and for several
species simultaneously. Even for kingdoms very distant
from metazoans (e.g. plants, fungi, or protists) the second approach may provide successful loci since in some
of these gene families the protein alignment files
included sequences from plants. We can predict that the
success rate will not depend much on the phylogenetic
proximity of the taxa to deuterostomes (since those protein sequences are definitely strongly conserved) but will
be influenced more on average by the genomic substitution rate of the taxonomic group. For instance, the ecdysozoan phyla (e.g. arthropods and nematodes) may not
work as well as molluscs and annelids, though these

phyla share a common ancestor relative to deuterostomes, since their genomes are known to evolve rapidly
at the nucleotide level [21,22]. For the third strategy,
based on already defined primers, genome nucleotide
composition may be an important factor (see above).
The facts that (i) low degeneracy codehop primers performed better than high degeneracy primers, and (ii) phylogenetic distance (to vertebrates and Ciona) has no
relationship with global amplification results, are positive
experimental findings of this study, and suggest that the
simplest strategy (use of the primers we defined) may be
sufficient in most metazoan species to obtain several
EPIC loci. In the increasing number of phylogenetic
groups where sufficient EST sequence data are available
to enrich nucleotide alignments in a variety of taxa, primer design may not require using the Codehop strategy
(personal observation from a new ongoing EPIC project).
From EPIC identification to genotyping of large samples

Once a promising EPIC locus has been found, it is not
always straightforward to directly characterize

populations with it. Obtaining sequence data prior to
genotyping is recommended. In some cases, good
results are provided by direct sequencing of PCR products. There are generally no indels in the exon
sequence, so the sequences are readable even with
ambiguous positions due to heterozygosity in this
region, allowing the design of specific primers. In some
(e.g. inbred) species where homozygous individuals are
common, direct sequencing is very useful, and eventually, “heterozygous sequences” may be deduced automatically from sequence files containing ambiguities,
using dedicated software [23,24]. When direct sequencing is not satisfactory, we recommend cloning the
EPIC amplicons from a dozen individuals and sequencing about 10 clones per individual to assess the nature
and the level of the variation, permitting (i) the definition of more specific primers if necessary and (ii) the
decision whether to characterize alleles by sequence, by
size, or by conformation. Some of these introns have
been cloned and sequenced in large samples of P. lividus, E. cordatum and species not included in the

Figure 7 Effect of the degeneracy levels of codehop primers on PCR results. Results from the 10 bilaterian genera in which both primers
were “codehop” were considered here (they cannot be directly derived from Table 1 since, for some introns, not all primer pairs were
“codehop”). The bars represent the total numbers of cases (species × primer pairs) displaying results ‘P’, ‘I’ ‘A’ or nulls, for three categories of
introns, those in which no (0), one (1) or both (2) primers have a more than 6-fold degeneracy. Exact tests were performed from the 4 × 3
contingency table used to build the histogram, as well as from tables derived from it after pooling some columns (for instance nulls versus “A +
I + P”): all were highly significant. The pie chart diagrams display the proportion of the four categories of results within each category of
degeneracy; they illustrate the increase in the proportion of null loci when primer degeneracy increases.

present study, and in all cases polymorphism is high
due to both indels and substitutions (unpublished). In
some cases, the EPIC locus provides diploid Mendelian
variation in fragment size visible on agarose gels. Alternatively, finer variations can be revealed using PAGE or
automatic sequencers [1]. Conformation techniques
(SSCP, DGGE or, more recently, melting curve genotyping (e.g. [25]) allow determination of allele classes, but
they have a sensitivity limited to relatively small fragments and they provide no information on allele relationships. The richest information for diploid specimens
is a diploid sequence genotype, but classical sequencing
techniques do not deal well with heterozygosity. “Next
generation sequencing” technologies, such as “454
sequencing”, in addition to their extreme rapidity,
should allow sequencing a mixture of numerous PCR
products, such as for instance from 15 EPIC loci in
each of 50 or more individuals, identified by individual
labels (4 base sequences, inserted in PCR primers or
linked to PCR products) for reasonable prices (less than
2000 € in 2009). These approaches differ in throughput,
cost and sensitivity (Table 5).

Conclusions
Our new method appears very efficient for finding universal intron loci (EPIC) in sequence data bases whatever the phylum, in metazoans. These EPICs, in
addition to providing a set of independent nuclear markers for population genetics and phylogeography, can
complement or replace the barcoding molecule used for
metazoans, COI, resolving problems associated with single marker studies or inherent in the mitochondrial genome, such as its lack of variability in some phyla [26].
For about ten of these EPICs we obtained sequence data
for several individuals, from one to nine distinct genera
(unpublished data, available on request). Insertions and
deletions were frequent (among which there were a few
microsatellites), in only two cases there was no polymorphism, and a minority of cases displayed paralogs or
distinct groups of sequences, a problem which was
solved when internal primers were defined. This study
therefore fills a serious gap in the toolbox of molecular
ecologists. These new and universal EPIC loci should
generate multilocus sequence datasets from populations
of numerous non-model species. Relative to single-locus

Methods
Bioinformatic assessment of candidate loci

We had previously tried a method based on the ExonIntron Database [26,27,8] but this was not successful
and thus we developed an original approach. In order to
find universal markers from orthologous genes, we took
advantage of annotated full-genome sequences to obtain
a list of candidate gene families.
The search involved three successive stages (I-III),
introducing some methodological changes between
stages; each stage contained the following steps, except
that step 3 was not performed for stages II-III (see Fig.
2 for flowchart).
Step 1: Gene family selection

The Famfetch software [28] was used to query revision 2
(stage I of our search) or revision 3 (stages II and III) of
the Homolens database of homologous gene families
[29] from Ensembl, and retain families for which orthologs were found in Homo, Rodentia, Canis, Gallus,
Danio, Xenopus, Percomorpha, Ciona, Insecta, and
Nematoda, but no duplication event occurred at the
root of any of these taxa in the family tree. This step
eliminated known highly conserved families, including
most or all of the already known “universal” EPIC loci,

but we estimated that the remaining loci would be less
prone to paralogy and laboratory effort would be saved.
Families in which one isolated species within one of
these taxa appeared duplicated were not eliminated (e.g.
family HBG001601 was retained (Fig. 3) although Aedes
aegyptii presents a duplication, since the duplication is
not shared by all Insecta). Step 1 provided 89 gene
families for stage I, and 159 gene families for stages II
and III, which were merged until step 6.
Step 2: Protein sequence retrieval

For each retained gene family, protein sequences were
retrieved with a python script, for stage I, or an R script
based on the Seqinr package [30], for stages II and III.
Step 3: Enrichment of protein sequence file

For stage I only, we enriched our protein alignment with
protein sequences from other deuterostome species
using the Query-Win software to obtain Genbank accession numbers for CDS of deuterostome taxa that were
not already included in Homolens. For each gene family,
blast searches using the Homo and nematode sequences
were performed on this new database; sequences leading
to a lower than 10-100 e-value were considered as homologous sequences. Only 30 additional sequences were
identified by this additional step.
Step 4: Multiple-sequence protein alignment

For each family, a multiple alignment of protein
sequences was obtained with ClustalW [31] (stage I) or
Muscle [32] (stages II and III).

Chenuil et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:276
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/276

Step 5: Intron position identification

Intron positions and phases were annotated on the
multiple alignment using either the Annote_int_mase
program (kindly provided by L. Duret, stage I) or an
R script using Seqinr (stages II and III).
Step 6 and 7: Retrieval of nucleotide sequences, and choice
of introns

Choice of introns occurred before retrieval of nucleotide
sequences for stage I and after retrieval for stages II and
III. For stage I, we first considered intron positions present in 100% of all species in all taxonomic groups (as
determined by a python script). When such positions
were considered promising (embedded within conserved
and low-degeneracy amino-acid sequences), we manually
retrieved corresponding nucleotide sequences using
tblastx, for Strongylocentrotus purpuratus at least (and
in some cases a few other species), to determine the 5′
part of the codehop PCR primers (see primer design
section).
Stage II was initiated before all stage I families were
thoroughly visually screened since we estimated that the
method changes introduced in Stage II would save time.
For stages II and III, CDS were retrieved and the corresponding nucleotide alignment was obtained using
PAL2NAL, for each family. The first 58 protein alignments, taken by increasing Homolens (HBGxxxxxx)
number, were examined visually, looking for introns
that were present in all the deuterostome species of the
alignment and that lay between regions conserved
enough to design PCR primers (see below).
In stage III, the remaining 101 families identified from
Homolens revision 3 were examined: for this stage, we
retrieved potentially homologous sequences from the
unannotated genomes of Saccoglossus, Nematostella and
Strongylocentrotus, by performing tblastn searches involving the protein sequences of Homo and Ciona. We
retained sequences leading to a lower than 10-5 e-value,
and for which protein sequence similarity with some
sequences in the original alignment was higher than 0.5.
For this stage we developed a new R script facilitating
the visual identification of both intron position and
exon sequence conservation in a multiple alignment.
This tool allowed us to consider introns whose position
varied only slightly among phyla, which may therefore
potentially provide EPIC markers (Fig.3). Region conservation was scored by computing a local similarity score
ω in a sliding window along the multiple alignment.
This similarity score is the geometric mean of up to
four components ω 0 ... ω 3 depending on the number
n of species for which additional sequences were available (1 ≤ n ≤ 3), where ω0 is the mean local nucleotide
similarity between pairs of sequences retrieved from
Homolens, and ω1, ω2 and ω3 are the highest nucleotide
identities between pairs of sequences involving one

Page 14 of 17

sequence from Homolens and one sequence from Strongylocentrus, Saccoglossus or Nematostella (when
sequences from these species were available). We used a
sliding window width of 20 nucleotides to compute ω,
and identified local peaks of nucleotide similarity in sliding windows of 51 nucleotides width. A plot of nucleotide conservation and intron occurrence was used to
visually select promising loci. Contrary to stage I, we did
not eliminate potentially usable EPIC loci whose position may vary by a few nucleotides.
In addition to this original research among Homolens
families, we specifically examined two genes containing
already known “universal” EPIC loci, the Elongation Factor 1 a subunit and the ATP-Synthase a subunit
[10,11]. We retrieved the corresponding metazoan
nucleotide sequences from Genbank and aligned them
with DIALIGN, specifying that the alignment contained
both coding (exon) and non coding regions (introns).
Then, we visually examined these alignment files to
identify potential EPIC loci.
Primer design

The great majority of primers were designed using the
Codehop method [33,34], which is based on an aminoacid alignment. The 3′ end of the primer (at least 11
bases) is degenerate in a way that represents all possible
nucleotide combinations considering that there are
usually several codons per amino-acid. The 5′ end,
called a clamp, is not degenerate, so that, although it
may not anneal during the first two cycles, it should, in
the following cycles, perfectly anneal to the primers
incorporated and replicated during previous cycles. Such
a strategy allows amplification of relatively variable
regions, while limiting the problems inherent in highly
degenerate primers. Primers were designed only when it
was possible to limit degeneracy to less than 32× (except
for a single primer that has 64× degeneracy) and most
of them have 8× or less degeneracy (Fig. 1). This rule,
aimed at reducing the risk of simultaneous amplification
of paralogs, eliminated numerous potential loci. In practice, to visually identify conserved regions containing
low-degeneracy codons, we used the Bioedit software
and customized the amino-acid background color code
to reflect the level of codon degeneracy. In some cases
when the nucleotide alignment appeared much less variable than predicted from codon degeneracy, conventional degenerate primers were designed, based on the
nucleotide alignment (i.e. ambiguities were tolerated
along the primer). In these cases, we often decided to
design the primer in two parts, with a 3′ part of at least
11 bp degenerate enough to represent all observed
nucleotide sequences in our alignment and a nondegenerate 5′ part, mimicking the Codehop design strategy [35]. Below, we will refer to these primers as

Chenuil et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:276

NucHop primers. All details of primer design and
sequences are in Fig. 1. The letters a, b, c, and d after

Within Bilateria, there are two important clades, the
Protostomia, which contain the Lophotrochozoa (such
as annelids and molluscs) and the Ecdysozoa (such as
arthropods and nematodes), and the Deuterostomia (to
which vertebrates, urochordates, and echinoderms
belong) (Fig. 5). We first had decided to focus on Deuterostomia in which more sequence data are available,
and to survey additional ascidian (Urochordata) species
(Corella eumyota, Perophora japonica, and Styela clava)
and echinoderm species (regular sea urchins: Paracentrotus lividus, Sterechinus agassizi, Sterechinus neumayeri; spatangoid sea urchins: Echinocardium
cordatum, Abatus agassizi, Abatus cavernosus, Abatus
cordatus, Abatus ingens, Abatus nimrodi; brittlestars:
Amphipholis squamata). To check whether the EPIC
loci selected would be exportable to more distant phyla,
we also surveyed two mollusc species (Protostomia),
Cerastoderma edule and Macoma balthica (both
bivalves), and two extremely divergent, non-bilaterian
species, the cnidarians Corallium rubrum (the red coral)
and Paramuricea clavata. These cnidarians belong to
the Octocorallia and are non-symbiotic. Initially, a first
round of six species was systematically tested with four
individuals per species and the “standard protocol”: the
three ascidian species, and three echinoderms: P. lividus,
E. cordatum, and A. squamata. Then additional tests
were made for these echinoderms and additional species. Table 3 reports the number of individuals, loci and
species tested per genus, and the corresponding technical conditions.
Molecular methods

DNA was extracted using phenol-chloroform methods
for Paracentrotus lividus and the three ascidian species,

plus Echinocardium cordatum, Amphipholis squamata,
and Abatus spp. [36]; a saline method was used for Sterechinus spp. [37], and the Nucleon phytopure kit for
some Abatus. In addition, specimens of E. cordatum
were also extracted using Chelex [38], or with the
QIAamp® DNA Kit (Qiagen), and specimens of P. lividus
were extracted using the Wizard® SV Genomic DNA
purification system (Promega). Paramuricea clavata
DNA was extracted using the QIAamp® kit, and we used
standard phenol-chloroform extractions for Corallium
rubrum. Polymerase Chain Reactions were performed in
a 10 μl final volume, using 0.25 u of GoTaq® Flexi-DNA
Polymerase and green buffer (Promega), in 5 mM
MgCl 2 , and 0.2 mM dNTP, with 10 pmol of each
primer, and with 10 ng of template DNA, except for
cnidarians for which template DNA probably exceeded
10 ng. PCR cycling temperature programs with fixed
annealing temperatures (Table 6) were first tried for a
few EPIC loci (trials at 48, 50, 55, or 60°C, according to
locus referred as “St-fix” or “fix-50-60” in Table 6), and
compared with two touch-down programs (TD6, TD6′);
subsequently, touch-down programs were preferred and
were used for all primer pairs for all EPIC loci except
cnidarians (referred as the standard protocol, Table 3).
For E. cordatum and P. lividus, all loci were additionally
amplified with fixed annealing temperatures (named EEGP in Table1). For cnidarians, a similar program was
used at 45°C (DA in Table 6). PCR products were visualized by electophoresis using 5 μl of product on a 1XTBE-1.5% agarose gel (260 ml) in a Biorad SubCell
Model 192 Cell, gels of 25 × 25 cm and 4 combs of 51
wells, during ca 1 h migration at 120 V, using 2.5 to 5
μl of 100 bp Benchtop ladder ® (Promega) as size
marker.
Nomenclature used to characterize the results to allow
comparison of methods

Results of PCR amplification as observed from agarose
gels were characterized, at first on a per species basis,
using the following rules. ‘Promising’ results (‘P’ in
Table 1) refer to the observation in all individuals of the
species of amplification products that were not too faint,
did not display numerous fragments (rare cases with

three bands were admitted, when one was constant) and
were long enough to contain an intron of ca 70-100 bp
at least. The second category is designated ‘I’ (intronsize amplicon), and corresponds to amplicons of the size
of an intron that were very faint or displayed multiple
bands or failed to amplify in at least one individual. The
third category, ‘Amplification’ (designated ‘A’), corresponds to amplification products too short to contain a
useful intron. Results in the subsequent tables and text
are reported by genus after pooling all the protocols
that were tried. For the species tested with several protocols (P. lividus, E. cordatum), and for the genera
where several species were tested (i.e. Abatus, Sterechinus), the best result is reported.
