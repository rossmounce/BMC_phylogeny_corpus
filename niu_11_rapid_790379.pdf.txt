Abstract
Background: Homeobox genes are the key regulators during development, and they are in general highly
conserved with only a few reported cases of rapid evolution. RHOXF2 is an X-linked homeobox gene in primates. It
is highly expressed in the testicle and may play an important role in spermatogenesis. As male reproductive
system is often the target of natural and/or sexual selection during evolution, in this study, we aim to dissect the
pattern of molecular evolution of RHOXF2 in primates and its potential functional consequence.
Results: We studied sequences and copy number variation of RHOXF2 in humans and 16 nonhuman primate
species as well as the expression patterns in human, chimpanzee, white-browed gibbon and rhesus macaque.
The gene copy number analysis showed that there had been parallel gene duplications/losses in multiple
primate lineages. Our evidence suggests that 11 nonhuman primate species have one RHOXF2 copy, and two
copies are present in humans and four Old World monkey species, and at least 6 copies in chimpanzees.
Further analysis indicated that the gene duplications in primates had likely been mediated by endogenous
retrovirus (ERV) sequences flanking the gene regions. In striking contrast to non-human primates, humans
appear to have homogenized their two RHOXF2 copies by the ERV-mediated non-allelic recombination
mechanism. Coding sequence and phylogenetic analysis suggested multi-lineage strong positive selection on
RHOXF2 during primate evolution, especially during the origins of humans and chimpanzees. All the 8 coding
region polymorphic sites in human populations are non-synonymous, implying on-going selection. Gene
expression analysis demonstrated that besides the preferential expression in the reproductive system, RHOXF2 is
also expressed in the brain. The quantitative data suggests expression pattern divergence among primate
species.
Conclusions: RHOXF2 is a fast-evolving homeobox gene in primates. The rapid evolution and copy number
changes of RHOXF2 had been driven by Darwinian positive selection acting on the male reproductive system and
possibly also on the central nervous system, which sheds light on understanding the role of homeobox genes in
adaptive evolution.

Background
Homeobox genes encode homeobox proteins that play a
crucial role in various developmental processes as transcription factors. A key feature of homeobox proteins is
the homeodomain, a 60-amino-acid helix-turn-helix
DNA-binding domain [1]. Due to their functional importance during development, most of the homeobox genes
(especially the homeodomain) are highly conserved at
sequence level [1-3]. There have been only a few published examples of rapid evolution of homeobox genes,
such as OdsH in flies [4], Hox genes in nematodes [5,6],
the Rhox5 cluster genes in rodents [7-12], and TGIFLX
and ESX1 in primates [13,14]. Here we report a novel
case of rapid evolution as well as copy number variation
(CNV) of an X-linked reproductive homeobox family
gene, member 2 (RHOXF2) in primates. This homeobox
gene is involved in spermatogenesis and may also play a
role in brain function.
RHOXF2, selectively expressed in the testis, was initially
identified as a member of the PEPP subfamily [15]. The
human RHOXF2 gene is also named as testis homeobox
gene 1 (THG1) or human paired-like homeobox protein
(hPEPP2). It is located on Xq24 and contains 4 exons
encoding a 288-amino-acids protein with two functional
domains, the homeodomain and the proline-rich domain

Page 2 of 14

(figure 1a)[15]. In humans, there are two copies of the
RHOXF2 gene on Xq24 in a head-to-head orientation, i.e.
RHOXF2 and RHOXF2b [15]. The Rhox (reproductive
homeobox on the X chromosome) cluster genes in
rodents have been considered to be orthologs of human
RHOXF2 [15]. Recent studies have shown that the human
RHOXF2 protein is functionally similar to the rodent
Rhox5, the founding member of the Rhox cluster,
expressed in the Sertoli cells of the testis and promoting
survival and differentiation of the adjacent male germ cells
during spermatogenesis [8,16-18]. Similar to the Rhox
cluster genes in rodents, the human RHOXF2 can downregulate the expression of Unc5c and Pltp, and up-regulate
Gdap1 expression in the Sertoli-cell pathway promoting
germ cell survival [16,18]. Interestingly, all three downstream genes directly regulated by RHOXF2 in the testis
also play important roles in the nervous system. In the
brain, Unc5c is a receptor of netrin-1, which is important
for axonal guidance, neuron migration and proliferation
[19,20]. Pltp is an important modulator of the signal transduction pathways in the human neurons, and is likely
involved in neurodegenerative and inflammatory brain diseases [21,22]. Gdap1 is involved in a signal transduction
pathway in neuronal development, and is responsible for

various Charcot-Marie-Tooth diseases, the most common
peripheral neuropathy [23,24].
Due to the function of RHOXF2 in spermatogenesis
and possibly in the central nervous system, we studied
the evolutionary pattern of this homeobox gene in primates, and we observed frequent gene duplications/losses
and rapid protein sequence changes. We also performed
expression pattern analysis in multiple primate species,
and examined between-species and between-paralogs
expression divergences. Our evidence suggests that the
rapid evolution of RHOXF2 at both the sequence and
expression levels is likely to have been caused by selection on the male reproductive system and possibly also
on the central nervous system.

Results
RHOXF2 copy number variation in primates

In humans, there are two RHOXF2 gene copies on Xq24
in a head-to-head orientation, RHOXF2 and RHOXF2b
(figure 1a) [15]. We sequenced the entire coding
sequences (867bp) and about 600bp adjacent noncoding
regions (including the entire 185bp intron-1 and the flanking sequences of the exons) in 111 human individuals
(including African, European, Melanesian and East Asian;
83 males and 28 females). There are 14 individuals (12
males and 2 females) showing no heterozygous sites in the
entire sequenced region. This suggests that these individuals either have two identical or only a single copy of the
RHOXF2 gene located on the X chromosome.
In the reference human genome, there are two 48.9-Kb
segmental tandem repeats containing the two RHOXF2
copies (figure 1a). We sequenced the genomic regions covering the breakpoints of the two segmental repeats in 30
human genomic DNA samples (including all individuals
without heterozygous site and all individuals subject to
qPCR). The data indicated that the breakpoint sequences
exist in all individuals (including 14 individuals without
heterozygous sites), implying that they all have two copies.
This result was further confirmed by genomic DNA realtime quantitative PCR of 9 individuals with heterozygous
sites (4 males and 5 females) and 8 individuals without heterozygous sites (7 males and 1 female) (see additional file
1). Using TKTL1, an X-linked single copy gene as a control, we found these samples are no difference in RHOXF2
genomic DNA quantity (P > 0.05, T test). Collectively, our
data demonstrate that the two copies of RHOXF2 are fixed
in contemporary humans.
To see whether the two-copy structure is conserved in
nonhuman primates, we first conducted PCR-based
sequencing of the entire coding region of the 16 nonhuman primate species (table 1). A single copy X-linked
gene would have no heterozygous site in males, therefore
heterozygous sites in males suggest more than one gene

Page 3 of 14

copy. Our results showed that three species (chimpanzees,
pig-tailed macaques and rhesus macaques) have heterozygous sites in males, suggesting more than one copy in
them. The two leaf monkey species (all females) also have
heterozygous sites. Since a single copy X-linked gene
would also have heterozygous sites in females due to
within-copy polymorphisms, their copy numbers were
then determined by genomic DNA qPCR. The other 11
nonhuman primate species do not exhibit any heterozygous sites, implying either a single copy or two/multiple
identical copies, which was then tested by genomic DNA
qPCR. According to the genome database, there are two
copies in the white-tufted-ear marmoset (one intact copy
and one incomplete copy due to low quality of the
sequence assembly) (http://genome.wustl.edu).
To identify the RHOXF2 gene sequences of individual
copies, we cloned and sequenced the PCR products of the
five species with heterozygous sites. In pig-tailed macaques
and rhesus macaques (all males), we identified two distinct
sequences in both species, implying the presence of two
copies. In rhesus macaques, there are 6 fixed single
nucleotide differences between the two copies and all of
them are non-synonymous substitutions located in the
proline-rich domain (see additional file 2). We then
sequenced 20 rhesus macaque individuals (including both
males and females). Interestingly, all 20 rhesus macaques
possessed the same two copy sequences without any
within-copy polymorphic sites, implying strong functional
restriction. The fixed sequence divergence between the
two rhesus macaque copies is totally different from the
pattern seen in humans, and the two human copies do not
exhibit any fixed substitutions.
The grey leaf monkey and the black leaf monkey (all
females) also possess two distinct sequences with 16 (14
non-synonymous and 2 synonymous substitutions) and 15
(13 non-synonymous and 2 synonymous substitutions)
substitutions respectively. The majority (14/16 for grey
leaf monkey, 14/15 for black leaf monkey) of the substitutions are shared between the two species, suggesting that
the substitutions are between-copy divergences instead of
within-copy polymorphisms. Therefore, grey leaf and
black leaf monkeys likely possess two copies of RHOXF2
(see additional file 2). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that
gene duplication occurred before the two species diverged
(figure 2).
The results of genomic DNA qPCR indicated that the
RHOXF2 genomic DNA quantities of rhesus macaques
and pig-tailed macaques are about twice those of other
macaque species with no heterozygous sites (figure 3a).
The same result was also seen for leaf monkeys when
compared with the Yunnan snub-nosed monkey (no heterozygous sites) (figure 3b). The data further supports that
rhesus macaques, pig-tailed macaques, grey leaf and black

Figure 2 The phylogenetic tree showing sequence substitution pattern of each primate lineage. The numbers of non-synonymous and
synonymous substitutions (N/S) and the amino-acid insertions-deletions are labeled for each lineage. The labeled “8/0” between HUM-1and
HUM-2 only represents the total N/S sites in the human population, and the labeled “7aa-del 2/1” between CHP-1 and CHP-2 just represents the
sequence difference between the within-species copies. Using marmoset sequence as outgroup, all internal node sequences were inferred by
PAML[36]. The lineages showing Ka/Ks ratios significantly larger than one are denoted by ‘*’ (p < 0.05) or ‘**’ (p < 0.01). The solid bars indicate
the duplication events, and the dashed bar on the chimpanzee lineage indicates the uncertainty of number of duplication events. The lineages
leading to humans and chimpanzees since the most recent common ancestor of Catarrhines (node E) are shown in thick lines. For the
abbreviations of the primate species, refer to table 1.

leaf monkeys possess two RHOXF2 gene copies, and there
is only one copy in the nonhuman primate species without
heterozygous sites.
In chimpanzees, we identified at least 4 different
sequences by screening the 26 cDNA clones from the testicle of a male individual, suggesting multiple copies in its
genome (see additional file 2 and additional file 3). To
explore the detailed genomic structure of RHOXF2 gene
copies in the chimpanzee, we screened the BAC (bacterial
artificial chromosome) library of a male chimpanzee
(CHORI251). We obtained 7 positive BAC clones containing the RHOXF2 gene sequence, including 281C1, 349N3,
565A12, 602H9, 792F3, 792G12 and 834E8. For three of
them (281C1, 349N3 and 565A12), sequences are available
in the NCBI database [GenBank: AC145687, AC142344
and AC183597]. Our BAC-end and breakpoint-region resequencing confirmed the sequence alignments of the

contig (315 kb) containing the three NCBI BAC clones,
and 3 copies of RHOXF2 gene are located within this contig (figure 1b). Two of the three copies are orthologs of
the two human copies according to the synteny of this
genomic region. We then partially sequenced the other 4
BAC clones, and we found that 792F3 showed sequence
differences from the 3 known BAC clones, an indication
of at least one extra copy in chimpanzees. Finally, we performed genomic DNA qPCR and the result showed that
the copy number in chimpanzees is about 3 times (3.03 ±
0.65) larger than in humans, suggesting 5-7 copies in
chimpanzees. Combining the data from the BAC clones
and the cDNA clones from testicle and brain samples (see
additional file 2 and additional file 3), there are at least 6
copies in the chimpanzee genome.
To reveal the genomic locations of all these copies in
chimpanzees, using BAC clone 281C1 as the probe

containing a complete copy of RHOXF2, we performed
chromosome fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).
The results indicated that all signals are located in the
long arm of X chromosome (see additional file 4), suggesting that all the copies are possibly tandem duplications on Xq24, which was partially reflected by the
determined genomic structure of the three copies in
chimpanzees (figure 1b).
Additionally, we sequenced the entire RHOXF2 gene
coding region of six chimpanzee individuals (genomic
DNA samples). We observed in-del polymorphisms in
exon 2 of three chimpanzees, implying that copy number
variation might exist in chimpanzees. We also performed
cDNA sequencing of testicle samples in chimpanzees, and
there are frame-shifting in-del polymorphisms, suggesting
that there are non-functional copies (pseudogenes) (see
additional file 2).
Endogenous retrovirus (ERV) sequences and copy number
variation

In humans, based on the sequences of male individuals, a
total of 12 haplotypes were inferred using PHASE [25].

Interestingly, we did not observe any fixed substitutions
between the two human copies. The haplotype pattern
indicates that almost all the substitutions are shared by
the two copies, suggesting frequent non-allelic homologous recombination between them. Further investigation
showed that there are two human endogenous retrovirus
(HERV) sequences located at the breakpoint region of
the two copies (figure 1). They are ERV3-like sequences,
similar to HERV15Yq1 and HERV15Yq2 located at Yq11
in the human genome [26]. It has been shown that the
intra-chromosomal homologous recombination between
HERV15Yq1 and HERV15Yq2 can mediate duplications
and deletions of the azoospermia factor A (AZFa) region
on the human Y chromosome, resulting in male infertility [27-29]. We used the HERV15 LTR 787-bp segment
sequence as a reference to acquire the HERV sequences
located at Xq24 from genome database [30]. It turned
out that there is almost no difference (1/783bp) between
the two HERV sequences flanking RHOXF2 (see additional file 5). Thus, the flanking locations of the two
HERV sequences and their high sequence similarity suggest that the HERVs may mediate frequent non-allelic

Niu et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:298
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/298

recombinations of the two human copies, similar to the
mechanism known for the AZFa region [27,28,30]. In the
database of Genomic Variants and 1000-Genomes, low
frequency copy number variations (CNVs) were observed
in humans covering the RHOXF2 gene region (http://projects.tcag.ca and http://browser.1000genomes.org)
[31,32], supporting the proposed non-allelic recombinations mediated by the HERVs.
Further analysis indicated that there are also ERV
sequences near RHOXF2 in the four nonhuman primate
species as their whole-genome sequences available for
study (chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan and rhesus macaque) (see additional file 5). Therefore, it is possible that
endogenous retrovirus sequences are the key elements
causing non-allelic recombinations, resulting in copy
number variation among primates. In the marmoset, we
found only one ERV sequence near RHOXF2, which is
likely due to the insufficient coverage of this genomic
region.
Compared with the human sequences (1/783), the
orthologous nonhuman primate ERV sequences are
highly diverged (20/780 in chimpanzee, 90/776 in gorilla, 57/767 in orangutan and 109/775 in rhesus macaque) (see additional file 5). This implies that frequent
non-allelic recombinations might not have occurred in
nonhuman primates involving two RHOXF2 copies (rhesus macaque, pig-tailed macaque, grey leaf and black
leaf monkey). For example, in the rhesus macaque, we
identified only two RHOXF2 coding-region haplotypes
with six fixed between-copy substitutions (see additional
file 2). This is consistent with previous computational
analysis as well as data for Arabidopsis, which proposed
that the recombination frequency decreases very rapidly
with the increase of sequence divergence [33,34]. In
chimpanzee, there are more than two ERV sequences
(figure 1b), resulting in a more complicated pattern
requiring further illumination through future detailed
sequence analysis.
Additionally, for the 11 primate species with no heterozygous site, the distinct sequence divergence between the
flanking ERVs (in gorilla and orangutan) is consistent
with our proposal of one RHOXF2 copy in these species,
as determined by genomic DNA qPCR (figure 3).

the sequence was reconstructed in each species without
any non-synonymous changes (see additional file 6). All
of the sequences from the other primates have distinctive haplotype sequences confirmed by clone sequencing. The intact copy of the marmoset sequence was
used as an out-group.
The aligned protein sequences revealed high substitution rates (as well as frequent in-dels) for RHOXF2 in
Catarrhini primates (see additional file 7) We found that
69.8% (206/295) of sites have become variable since the
most recent ancestor of Catarrhine. In other words, only
30.2% of amino acids are identical among the 17 primate species, an indication of rapid evolution. Besides
amino acid changes, there are also multiple deletions/
insertions of short amino acid fragments, especially
along the lineages to humans and chimpanzees (figure 2).
Notably, the fixed protein sequence divergence between
human and chimpanzee is 5.7% (16/281), which is much
higher than the genome average (1.34%) [35].
The comparison of non-synonymous (Ka) and synonymous (Ks) nucleotide distances between gene
sequences can detect selection acting on a gene. A high
Ka/Ks ratio (>1) indicates positive selection, whereas a
lower Ka/Ks ratio indicates negative selection (<1). The
Ka versus Ks ratios for all species indicated high values
(Ka/Ks > 1) in 222 out of the 253 pairs (87.7%) (figure 4,
see additional file 8), an implication of deviation from
the expectation of neutrality (Ka/Ks = 1) and strong
positive selection on RHOXF2 during primate evolution.
The signal of positive selection in primates was confirmed by comparing Model 2a (selection) and Model
1a (neutral) using the maximum-likelihood method
(2ΔLnL = 31.88, P = 0.000000194) [36]. We also examined the detailed substitution pattern of each primate

Multi-lineage positive selection on primates

We conducted coding sequence comparison among the
primate species as well as phylogenetic-tree-based analysis for the molecular signatures of selection. To simplify
the phylogenetic analysis, we generated two sequences
by randomizing the SNPs of humans and chimpanzees
respectively to represent their RHOXF2 coding
sequences. Different combinations of randomizing the
SNPs gave rise to the same results, and it remains unaffected under the most conservative scenario in which

large values (>1). Ka/Ks ratios were estimated following PamiloBianchi-Li’s method [65,66].

lineage in the phylogenetic tree (figure 2). The Ka/Ks
ratios of many primate lineages are larger than one, and
some are statistically significant, especially the lineages
leading to humans and chimpanzees, and the lineage to
the Yunnan snub-nosed monkey (figure 2) [37,38].
Notably, all of the Ka/Ks ratios for the lineages leading
to humans and chimpanzees since the most recent common ancestor of Catarrhines are larger than 1 (thick
lines in figure 2). The likelihood ratio test (modified
model A test) indicated that these lineages have a significantly larger ω (dN/dS) value (>1) (2ΔLnL = 4.23, P <
0.05), suggesting strong positive selection during the
evolution of humans and chimpanzees (table 2). In comparison, another Rhox family member RHOXF1, located
in the same genomic region (figure 1a), evolved much
more slowly than RHOXF2 (table 2).
In the 111 human individuals tested, we observed eight
sequence polymorphisms (SNPs) and all of them are nonsynonymous substitutions (83A/T, 93N/D, 151R/C, 151R/
H, 176L/F, 209Q/H, 235G/D and 286 P/L). Surprisingly,
three of them (151R/C, 151R/H and 176L/F) are located in
the homeodomain (table 3). No synonymous substitutions
were observed in the entire coding region of RHOXF2, an
indication of on-going positive selection on current human
populations. In the chimpanzee lineage (node A to chimpanzee ancestor), there are 5 non-synonymous substitutions while a 7-aa deletion without any synonymous
substitution was located in the homeodomain (figure 2).
The Ka/Ks ratio is significantly larger than one (P < 0.01,
one-tailed Z test) [37], again supporting the hypothesis of
strong positive selection on the RHOXF2 homeodomain
during the evolution of humans and chimpanzees.
In Old World monkeys, RHOXF2 were duplicated twice
independently, one in the leaf monkey lineage and the
other in the macaque lineage (in the common ancestor of
rhesus macaques and pig-tailed macaques). Theoretically,

it is also possible that there have been three copy loss
events (the ancestor of DL and YGM, the RG lineage, and
the ancestor of STM, AM and PDM) which can explain
the observed pattern although it is less parsimonious than
the proposed two independent duplications. Strong positive selection was detected in the Yunnan snub-nosed
monkey lineage as well as in the lineage including rhesus
and pig-tailed macaques (figure 2). Taken together, during
the evolution of primates, along with parallel gene duplications and/or losses, positive selection has been acting on
multiple primate lineages leading to the rapid protein
sequence changes of RHOXF2.
Expression pattern of RHOXF2 in primates

To exam the expression pattern of RHOXF2 in primates,
we performed real-time qPCR in four primate species
(rhesus macaques, the white-browed gibbon, chimpanzee and humans). The general expression patterns in
human, chimpanzee and gibbon are similar, consistent
with the reported data in human and mice [15,39], in
which RHOXF2 is preferentially expressed in the testis
(figure 5). However, the rhesus macaque showed a very
different expression pattern. RHOXF2 is expressed in all
the major tissues, but the highest expression was
observed in the lung instead of the testicle (figure 5).
This was further confirmed by testing two more individuals (one 2 yr male and one 2 yr female) (see additional file 9). The functional implication of the
preferential expression of RHOXF2 in the lung of rhesus
macaque is yet to be dissected.
It is noteworthy that we also observed expression of
RHOXF2 in the brain. In humans, RHOXF2 is weakly
expressed in the brain compared with the testis, and
there are between-individual and between-developmental-stage variations (figure 5). In Wayne et al. (2002),
the brain expression of RHOXF2 was not detected,
which was likely due to the insensitive technology
(Northern blot) used. RHOXF2 is also expressed in the
brains of chimpanzee, gibbon and rhesus macaque.
To examine the expression of individual RHOXF2
paralog, we cloned and sequenced cDNAs of the two
RHOXF2 copies in humans, and screened 7 adult
human testicle samples and 4 human brain samples. We
found that both copies are almost equally expressed in
all testicle samples (clone counting, 20:17; see additional
file 3), implying that the two copies are functionally
redundant in the human testis. However, in the human
brain, the expression pattern is different. In the embryo
and new born brains, both copies are expressed (clone
counting, 34:20; see additional file 3), while only one
copy is expressed in adult brains (clone counting, 35:0;
see additional file 3), suggesting tissue and developmental stage related expression divergence of the two
RHOXF2 copies during human evolution.

Note: The ancestral alleles in humans were determined by comparing with the non-human primate species. The frequencies shown are the derived alleles.

In the chimpanzee brain, we detected four cDNA
sequences (clone counting, 34:45:4:1) and two of them
are the major forms. One of the major forms (clone
counting, 45) is a novel splice form that was not
detected in the chimpanzee testis, however, this form
produces a truncated protein. The other two minor
forms likely represent background expression due to

their truncated open-reading frames (see additional file
2, additional file 3) and low expression levels. Interestingly, all four brain-expressed forms are from only one
of the six gene copies in chimpanzee, suggesting
between-copy expression divergence, similar to the pattern observed in the human brain. In the rhesus macaque, the expression pattern is similar among testicle,

Discussion
We have presented a novel case of rapid evolution of an
X-linked homeobox gene in primates. Interestingly,
unlike the few previously studied cases [8-10,13,14],
RHOXF2 also shows copy number variation among primate species. We showed that there had been parallel
RHOXF2 duplications and/or losses along multiple primate lineages, which were likely mediated by the flanking
ERVs. A similar gene duplication pattern was also
observed for the mouse Rhox alpha subcluster paralogs
[8-12], and gene loss was reported in the Hox gene cluster in nematode [5,6].
RHOXF1 and RHOXF2 are the only members of the
Rhox family in primates [40]. Due to the rapid evolution of
the Rhox family, RHOXF1 and RHOXF2 are highly divergent from their rodent orthologs. However, their functional roles in the reproductive system have been
maintained in both rodents and primates. In the mouse,
Rhox5 is expressed in both male and female germ cells in
developing fetal gonad [41,42]. In adults, it is expressed in
the testis, epididymis and ovary [43,44]. The Rhox5 null
mice are subfertile, with defects in spermatozoa production and motility [8,41]. The mouse Rhox cluster has more
than 30 genes with partially overlapping expression patterns, and plays partially redundant but distinct functional
roles [8-10,18,45]. RHOXF1 and RHOXF2 in primates are
functionally similar to Rhox5 in mouse. In the testis, both
of them may down-regulate Unc5c and Pltp expression,
but only RHOXF2 can up-regulate Gdap1 expression [18].
During primate evolution, RHOXF1 was apparently highly
conserved and likely maintains its original functional role
in the reproductive system. In contrast, RHOXF2 has
evolved rapidly leading to potential functional divergence
in primates.
Darwinian positive selection is likely the key driving
force leading to copy number variation, rapid amino acid
changes as well as potential functional (e.g. gene expression pattern) divergence of RHOXF2 in primates. In several species, e.g. rhesus macaque and leaf monkeys,
selection and lack of recombination have caused distinct
sequence divergence between the two RHOXF2 copies
within each species, which could lead to functional divergence. In humans, signals of rapid evolution and positive
selection were also detected. However, due to frequent
non-allelic recombinations, the two human copies have
not clearly diverged. The situation in chimpanzees is
much more complicated in which both rapid evolution
and gene pseudolization might have occurred.
It has been shown that gene copy number and expression level are highly correlated [46]. For homeobox genes,

Page 10 of 14

due to their important roles in development, dosage
changes may lead to functional consequences [47,48]. As
the major function of RHOXF2 in primates is male reproduction, we speculate that the observed strong selection in
multiple primate lineages is likely to be related to sperm
competition in promiscuous mating systems [49,50].
Among the 17 primate species studied, four species
showed strong signatures of positive selection (human,
chimpanzee, Yunnan snub-nosed monkey and rhesus
macaque), and all of them have promiscuous mating systems [51-57]. This pattern is also seen for the Rhox cluster
in rodents [8].
In addition to its potential role in spermatogenesis,
RHOXF2 may also be involved in the functioning of the
nervous system. All the three down-stream genes directly
regulated by RHOXF2, i.e. Unc5c [19,20], Pltp [21,22] and
Gdap1 [23,24] also play important roles in the central nervous system. Hence, the brain expression of RHOXF2 in
primates implies its possible involvement in brain function. In humans, only one of the two RHOXF2 copies is
expressed in adult brains, and both copies are expressed
equally in the brains of embryos and new-borns. This suggests a potential role of RHOXF2 in brain development
[16-18]. Thus, it is likely that RHOXF2 may function in
both the male reproductive system and the central nervous
system through interactions with the down-stream genes.
The question remains as to just how the expression of
RHOXF2 is regulated in these different tissues.
It has been shown that the genome-wide gene expression patterns are similar between brain and testis in
humans [58]. Interestingly, the human RHOXF2 protein
down-regulates the expression of the Netrin-1 receptor,
Unc5c [16-18], expressed in both brain and testis [16,59].
In the brain, the UNC5C protein level is mainly influenced
by the Netrin-1 protein, which increases apoptosis of the
UNC5C-expressing neurons [60,61]. In the testis, Unc5c
prevents Sertoli cell from apoptosis and ensure sperm production [16]. A genome-wide analysis of cancer-testis (CT)
gene expression showed that RHOXF2 is a CT gene with
testis-selective expression [39]. Coincidentally, the CT
genes are also expressed in a high percentage of human
central nervous system tumors [62]. The potential functional role of RHOXF2 in the brain is likely the outcome
of Darwinian positive selection which has driven the rapid
evolution and functional divergence of RHOXF2 in primates, especially those species with more than one gene
copies.
It is well known that brain evolution is not always positively associated with reproductive fitness [63]. A mutation with advantages for brain function may sometimes
be detrimental to the reproductive system (and vice
versa). Therefore, natural selection will result in a balance
between the competing demands and advantages of brain
and testis functions. As RHOXF2 may play a dual role

Niu et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:298
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/298

acting in the testis and brain, it may have developed certain mechanism for balancing potential functional conflicts between reproduction and cognition. One potential
molecular mechanism is the between-copy gene expression divergence, e.g. in human, both of the RHOXF2
copies are equally expressed in the testis, but only one
copy is expressed in the adult brain. The potential functional divergence of different copies are yet to be elucidated by further studies in the future.

Conclusions
In summary, we provided an informative example of
rapid evolution and copy number variation of an Xlinked homeobox gene (RHOXF2) in primates. Our
sequence analysis indicates that parallel gene duplications/losses were likely to have been mediated by the
flanking ERVs, and the rapid evolution of RHOXF2 had
been driven by Darwinian positive selection on the male
reproductive system and possibly also on the central
nervous system, resulting in between-copy sequence and
expression divergence among the primate species with
more than one gene copy.
Methods
Ethics statement

All of the DNA samples used in this study were taken
from collections by the Kunming Cell Bank of CAS,
Kunming Blood Center and Shanghai National Genome
Center in China. The research protocol was approved
by the internal review board of Kunming Institute of
Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Human and non-human primate DNA samples

For DNA samples, a total of 111 human individuals
from the major continental populations were sampled
and sequenced, including 32 Africans, 21 Europeans, 10
Melanesians and 48 East Asians (Chinese and Cambodian). We also sampled 16 nonhuman primate species
(10 Old World monkey species, 3 lesser ape species and
3 great ape species) reflecting a 25 million-year history
of primate evolution (table 1). The sequences of a New
World monkey species, white-tufted-ear marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) were obtained from the database (http://
genome.wustl.edu).

(Takara, Japan) and then transformed into E. coli DH5a.
The individual clones were picked for sequencing.
Sequencing was performed in both directions with the
forward and reverse primers on an ABI-3130 automated
sequencer.
BAC library screening

The pooled PCR-based method was used to screen a
chimpanzee BAC library (CHORI251). According to the
published sequences, the PCR primers were designed for
BAC library screening. The best primer pairs were
selected from the designed PCR primers through a series of pre-experiments. Primer sequences are shown in
additional file 10. The BAC end sequencing was performed for all the positive clones [64].
RNA samples, reverse transcriptional PCR (RT PCR),
cloning and sequencing

We collected various organs (heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, muscle, intestine, pancreas, testicle and brain etc.) of
three Chinese rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) (one
male and one female 2 years old, and one male 20 years
old), one white-browed gibbon (Hylobates hoolock) (male,
6 years old) and one chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) (male,
2 years old). We also collected human brain samples from
one new born male (1 month) and two adult males (28
years, 40 years), and multiple tissue samples from a female
embryo (36 weeks). cDNAs from 2 rhesus macaque testis,
7 human testis, 2 chimpanzee testis were used for full
length cDNA sequencing.
The total RNA samples were extracted with TRIzol
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) following a standard protocol.
They were treated with DNaseI (Takara, Tokyo, Japan) to
remove possible genomic DNA contamination, then subject to reverse transcription using Omniscript Reverse
Transcriptase (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) with oligo-dT primers (18 nucleotides), following the manufacturer’s protocol. PCR was carried out at 95°C for 5 min, and then at
95°C for 30s, 59°C for 30s, and 72°C for 30s (or 2 min) for
35 cycles, and finally 72°C for 10 min. The primer
sequences are presented in additional file 10. Cloning and
sequencing were performed as described for the genomic
DNA PCR products.

Genomic DNA PCR, cloning and sequencing

Gene copy number and expression level determination
by real-time quantitative PCR

The coding region of the RHOXF2 gene (exon 1-4) was
amplified by PCR and sequenced in humans and 16
nonhuman primate species. Universal primers for all
species were designed based on published sequences of
human and other primate species. The primer sequences
are listed in additional file 10. We first sequenced the
PCR products directly. Then the PCR products were
cloned into a pMD19-T vector using the T-vector kit

The quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was performed
using the SYBR premix ExTaq II (Takara, Tokyo, Japan)
on a LightCycler 480 (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). For gene
copy number estimation, the relative quantification
method based on ΔΔCt was used to determine the relative
copy numbers of the RHOXF2 gene in different species by
comparison with a known single copy X-linked gene,
transketolase-like 1 (TKTL1). The amplification

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/298

efficiencies of RHOXF2 and TKTL1 in human and other
non-human primates were tested and proven to be equal.
PCR was carried out at 95°C for 4 min, and then at 95°C
for 20s, 61°C for 20s for 40 cycles. For humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans and gibbons, the primers
sequences are: NM032498_RT_F AGGGCATCAATGGCAAGAAAC and NM032498_RT_R AGGC TGCTGGA
ATGGCTGT; NM012253_RT_F TGGCAAT CTTTGA
TGTGAACCG and NM012253_RT_R GGGG CAGGACAGAATGGAAAT. For the Old World monkeys, the primer pairs are: PEPP2-RT-owm-F AGAAGAGCCAAG
TGGAGGAGACA and PEPP2-RT-owm-R GCAGTTACCATGACAGGCTGG; TKTL1-RT-owm-F CTACCGGGT
GTTCTGCCTCAT and TKTL1-RT-owm-R AGATTGTC
CAGACTGTAGTAGGAAGCA.
For measuring the gene expression levels, cDNA realtime PCRs were performed and the expression levels were
determined by using glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) as the internal reference gene. PCR was carried
out at 95°C for 2 min, and then at 95°C for 10s, and 64°C
for 20s for 40 cycles. A variety of tissue types (heart, liver,
spleen, lung, kidney, muscle, intestine, pancreas, testicle
and brain etc.) were tested in Chinese rhesus macaques
(one male and one female of 2 years old, and one male of
20 years old), white-browed gibbon (one 6 yrs male),
chimpanzee (one 2 yrs male) and human (three brain samples, one testicle sample and multiple tissue samples from
one female embryo). The GAPDH primers are identical in
all four primate species: GAPDH_F ATTGCCCTCAACGACCACTTT and GAPDH_R GGTCTCTCTCTTCCT
CTTGTGCTCT. The RHOXF2 primer pairs are: for
humans, pepp2-HUM-QF1 CGTCCACGCCTTCACCCC
and pepp2-HUM-QR1 GTCTCCTCCATTTGGCTCTTCTATT; for chimpanzees, PEPP2-cRT-chp-hum-F1 CGAGCAGTTC CCCAGTGAGTT and PEPP2-cRT-chp-R1
CCATTGATGCCCTCTGATGTCTC; for the white-browed gibbon, pepp2-GB-QF3 ACTACAGGATATGAA
TGCT GCGGT and pepp2-GB-QR3 TGCTGCTTCT
GTG CCTTGCT; For rhesus macaques, pepp2-RM-QF2
CAGGAGCTGGAGCGCATTTTC and pepp2-RM-QR2
CCTCCACTTGGCTCTTCTATTCTCA. The PCR product lengths are 164bp, 128bp, 100bp and 132bp respectively. The primer pairs are from different exons of
RHOXF2 to avoid potential genomic DNA contamination.
The list of the primers used is given in additional file 10.
For each tissue sample, one RNA extraction was prepared,
and the qPCR was repeated three times.
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)

The positive BAC clone DNA was extracted according to
the modified alkaline-lysis method. CHORI251-281C1
BAC clone DNA was labeled by Nick-translation with Biotin-dCTP (Invitrogen). The FISH method was described
previously [64]. To eliminate the effect of cross-

Page 12 of 14

hybridization of common repeat sequences, the probes
were blocked by using repetitive DNA (Cot) before hybridization. At least 10 independent metaphases or interphase
nuclei were examined in determination of chromosomal
band location.
Data analysis

Sequence data was edited and aligned using DNASTAR
(DNASTAR, Inc.), then inspected and confirmed manually. The DNA haplotypes (or copies) of humans were
inferred using PHASE [25]. The haplotypes of other nonhuman primates were determined by cloning and
sequencing when more than two heterozygous sites were
observed. For phylogenetic analysis, a neighbor joining
(NJ) tree was constructed using MEGA4 [38]. Synonymous and non-synonymous substitution rates (Ks and
Ka) were calculated using Pamilo-Bianchi-Li’s method
[65,66], and the one-tailed Z test was used to detect
deviation from neutrality [37,38]. Using PAML [36], the
ancestral sequences of the internal nodes of the phylogenetic tree were inferred, and the substitution patterns
were compared among different evolutionary lineages.
Based on Yang’s method [36], the selection model 2a
(comparing with the neutral model 1a) was used to test
positive selection in primates. Modified model A (thick
lines in figure 2, i.e. the branches from the most recent
common ancestor of Catarrhines to the human and
chimpanzee lineages were taken as the foreground and
compared with the corresponding null model with ω2 =
1 fixed) was used to test if there have been positive selections (Ka/Ks > 1) during the origins of humans and
chimpanzees.
