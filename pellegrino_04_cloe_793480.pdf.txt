Abstract
Background: Public repositories of microarray data contain an incredible amount of information
that is potentially relevant to explore functional relationships among genes by meta-analysis of
expression profiles. However, the widespread use of this resource by the scientific community is
at the moment limited by the limited availability of effective tools of analysis. We here describe
CLOE, a simple cDNA microarray data mining strategy based on meta-analysis of datasets from
pairs of species. The method consists in ranking EST probes in the datasets of the two species
according to the similarity of their expression profiles with that of two EST probes from
orthologous genes, and extracting orthologous EST pairs from a given top interval of the ranked
lists. The Gene Ontology annotation of the obtained candidate partners is then analyzed for
keywords overrepresentation.
Results: We demonstrate the capabilities of the approach by testing its predictive power on three
proteomically-defined mammalian protein complexes, in comparison with single and multiple
species meta-analysis approaches. Our results show that CLOE can find candidate partners for a
greater number of genes, if compared to multiple species co-expression analysis, but retains a
comparable specificity even when applied to species as close as mouse and human. On the other
hand, it is much more specific than single organisms co-expression analysis, strongly reducing the
number of potential candidate partners for a given gene of interest.
Conclusions: CLOE represents a simple and effective data mining approach that can be easily used
for meta-analysis of cDNA microarray experiments characterized by very heterogeneous
coverage. Importantly, it produces for genes of interest an average number of high confidence
putative partners that is in the range of standard experimental validation techniques.

Background
The availability of genome sequences from several model
organisms, including humans, and of high-throughput

technologies to study gene function is dramatically changing the approach to biological problems. In particular, the
consolidated reductionist gene-by-gene strategy is being

replaced by a 'modular approach', in which several genes
are studied simultaneously to gather a more comprehensive picture of the many different cellular processes [1]: in
living organisms, the majority of gene products are part of
intricate molecular circuits, composed of physical, functional and regulatory interactions. In higher eukaryotes,
the study of gene function is further complicated by the
alternative use of transcriptional units, frequently resulting in the production of proteins with different or even
antagonistic activities from the same genes [2,3].
It is well recognized that one of the most important and
widespread mechanisms used by cells to regulate functional modules is the coordinate transcriptional and/or
post-transcriptional modulation of mRNA levels of the
interacting genes. Therefore, DNA microarrays represent a
fundamental tool to unravel biological complexity on a
genome-wide scale. Information concerning the expression of thousands of genes, and also of different transcripts from the same gene, can be obtained in a single
experiment, and the relationships among gene expression
patterns can be studied systematically [4]. The extensive
use of this technology by hundreds laboratories has
resulted in the production of an enormous amount of
data, many of which have been deposited in public databases [5,6].
Besides being useful to other researchers to confirm the
published results, the deposited datasets can be used as a
substrate for new analysis, aimed at discovering functional modules by searching for related expression profiles. Recent studies have shown that, if the expression of
two or more genes is consistently related throughout
many independent microarray datasets, the genes display
a significant degree of functional similarity [7,8]. However, if this approach were applied to predict physical and
functional relationships, a very high number of false positives would still be expected. A first method that can be
used to reduce the number of false positives is to consider
only co-expression links that are consistent among many
different experimental datasets [7]. Nevertheless, even
when the co-expression of two genes is reproducibly
observed under a certain number of experimental conditions, this does not imply necessarily that they are functionally related. For instance, extensive meta analysis of
microarray data across different species has revealed that
neighboring genes are likely to be co-expressed, even
though they are not functionally related in any obvious
manner [9,10].
Phylogenetic conservation has been recently proposed as
a very strong criterion to identify functionally relevant coexpression links among genes [11]. Significant co-expression of two or more orthologous genes across many species is very likely due to selective advantages, strongly

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/5/179

suggesting a functional relation. In fact, the comparison of
data across species as distant as Homo sapiens, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis
elegans was very effective in identifying new genes
involved in core biological functions [11]. Although
extremely specific, this multi-species approach would be
unable to identify the relationships among genes involved
in more specialized biological processes.
Since regulatory regions diverge much more rapidly than
coding sequences [12,13], a similar approach would be
predicted to succeed even when comparing expression
patterns in more closely related species, such as mice and
humans. In this case, the possible loss of specificity would
be strongly compensated by the increased sensitivity in
the identification of functional links related to mammalian-specific gene modules. This possibility has not been
so far explored.
Additionally, when using microarray data to establish significant correlations among gene expression profiles,
almost invariably the information obtained with probes
covering different gene portions is averaged [14]. Though
useful in many cases to reduce the experimental noise,
this procedure could result in a significant loss of information in the case of genes expressing different isoforms with
distinct expression patterns [15]: on one hand the isoform-specific expression profiles would not be detected;
on the other hand, the average expression profile would
be artificial and non-informative.
In this study we describe CLOE (Coexpression-based
Linking of Orthologous ESTs) a new data mining method
for the identification of transcripts showing evolutionary
conserved co-expression in cDNA microarray datasets.
This approach is based on the pairwise comparison of
data from two species. The predictive capability of the
method was proved by comparing human with mouse
data. Our results show that CLOE is a valuable tool for
biologists that can be used to identify putative partners for
genes of interest and/or to predict some of their functional
properties.

Results and discussion
The top percentiles of expression similarity ranked lists
obtained with human-mouse orthologous ESTs pairs are
strongly enriched of orthologous ESTs
The aim of our method is to use the available microarray
expression data to identify high- confidence putative partners for genes of interest.

The basic assumption is that, if two or more genes are part
of a functional module, conserved between two species,
they will be likely co-expressed in both species. In contrast, if the co-expression of two genes in one species has

BMC Bioinformatics 2004, 5:179

no functional meaning, it should not be conserved in the
other.
A flow chart of the method is given in Figure 1. In summary, after finding representative EST clones for the gene
of interest in cDNA microarray datasets of both species,
we order all the ESTs in each dataset according to similarity of their expression pattern with that of the chosen
ESTs. We then extract the orthologous pairs found in a
given top percentage of the ranked lists. Moreover, to
obtain a functional characterization of the identified putative partners, we analyze the co-expressed orthologous
pairs for overrepresentation of Gene Ontology (GO) keywords [16].
Although in principle our method could be applied to
every pair of organisms for which cDNA microarray data
are available, we decided to compare the human and
mouse datasets contained in the Stanford Microarray
Database (SMD) [6] (2803 experiments for 74588 EST
probes and 145 experiments for 37521 ESTs, respectively,
data downloaded in Jan. 2004). The first reason for doing
so is that this comparison is particularly relevant in the
perspective of identifying mammalian-specific gene modules. The second is that, considering the widely different
number of experiments and the relatively short phylogenetic distance between the two species, this represents a
particularly severe test.
As a first proof of the method's effectiveness, and in order
to empirically determine a reasonable default cutoff for
obtaining the final list of candidates, we analyzed whether
genes with the highest ranks in the single organism lists
are actually enriched of orthologous sequences. To this
aim, we randomly chose 100 orthologous gene pairs represented in both the human and mouse datasets and
selected, for each one, the most representative EST (i.e. the
probes with the highest number of experiments in each
dataset). We then generated the respective ranked lists,
subdivided them in 1% rank intervals and analyzed the
number of orthologous pairs in corresponding rank intervals. As a control, we performed the same analysis on an
equal number of randomly chosen (and hence nonorthologous) human-mouse EST pairs. The analysis was
repeated three times with essentially identical results.
As shown in Figure 2, compared to the control, a strong
average enrichment of orthologous pairs was observed in
the top 1% rank interval (p = 1.6Â·10-94, chi square test).
The difference was still very significant in the 2% rank
interval, even though with a much higher p value (p =
1.3Â·10-10), but was not detectable below that threshold.
Interestingly, a slight enrichment was also observed in the
last rank interval (average number of orthologous pairs
equal to 7.8 for CLOE and 5.7 for random lists, p =

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/5/179

2.2Â·10-7). The latter observation is consistent with the
previously noted fact that negative correlations tend to be
less common and significant than positive correlations
[7]. Based on these results, we chose a top 1% cutoff for
all the following analysis.
Predictive value of CLOE compared to single organisms
and multiple species co-expression analysis
We next investigated the effectiveness of our approach, by
comparing it to single and multiple organisms co-expression analysis. To address this point, we analyzed the ability of the three methods to predict known physical and
functional interactions among mammalian proteins. Protein-protein complexes have begun to be determined on a
genome-wide scale only for Saccharomyces cerevisiae [17],
Drosophila melanogaster [18] and Caenorhabditis elegans
[19], but no comparable datasets have been so far published for mammalians, making it impossible to perform
a systematic comparison. Therefore, we focused on three
supramolecular structures, which have been analyzed by
different proteomic strategies at a high level of detail: the
centrosome [20] (110 proteins), the post-synaptic density
[21] (105 proteins) and the TNF-alpha/NFkB signalosome [22] (128 proteins). For the single organism and
CLOE approaches, the analysis was restricted to proteins
represented in the SMD by at least one human and one
murine EST probe. These corresponded to 62, 67 and 97
ESTs pairs, respectively, covering on average 66% of the
proteins found in these complexes. In contrast, only 37%
of these genes were represented in the multiple species
network, thus confirming that the previous two methods
can be applied to a number of genes much higher than the
latter.

The average number of candidates produced by CLOE for
each analyzed protein was approximately 17, which represents a strong reduction if compared to the single organism approach (746 and 375 for the human and mouse
datasets, respectively). On the other hand, the average percentage of CLOE links that correspond to a documented
protein-protein interaction was 6.6 %, i.e. approximately
5 times higher than that obtained with the single organism method (Table 1). Significantly, the predictive value
of human-mouse CLOE was very similar to that obtained
by the multiple species co-expression network (Table 1).
Since considering only the proteomically-identified interactions could lead to a strong underestimation of the positive results, as low affinity and purely functional
interactions would be completely excluded, we decided to
evaluate the predictive power of the three different methods respect to a less stringent functional index. To this
aim, we first determined which GO keywords represent
the best annotation of the three complexes, by identifying
the ones that are significantly overrepresented in the

rank interval was determined. The average number of these ESTs in the first top 10 rank intervals was plotted. Error bars =

datasets, we selected the most representative human and mouse probes. A CLOE analysis with a top 1% cutoff was performed on
these sequences. In parallel, the human dataset was ranked for each human EST, and lists of candidates corresponding to the top 1%
ranks where obtained (Single organism). The prevalence of ESTs corresponding to other proteins of the same complexes was then
determined for both approaches. Finally, to determine the prevalence of correct predictions by the Multiple Species approach, we
determined the ratio between the number of links with other proteins of the same complex and the total number of links for all the
complex components (data from [11]).

annotation of the respective proteins. Then, every predicted candidate partner obtained with the three methods
for all analyzed proteins was considered as a true positive
if it is annotated to at least one of the overrepresented keywords of the corresponding complex. The results of this
analysis are summarized in Table 2.
Interestingly, even though also in this case our approach
and the multiple species comparison gave, on average, a
higher percentage of compatible predictions, this was not
dramatically different from the single-organism method.
These results strongly suggest that, compared to the single
organism approach, the highly reduced number of
candidate partners produced by multiple organism coexpression analysis and CLOE is strongly enriched of
genes characterized by more stringent functional
relationships.

Conclusions
We have shown that CLOE represents a very flexible and
effective data mining approach to infer a list of putative
partners and the potential functions for genes of interest.
It can be easily used for meta-analysis of cDNA microarray
experiments characterized by very heterogeneous coverage, producing significant results even when data from
two species as close as mouse and human are analyzed.
Compared to single organisms co-expression analysis, it

strongly reduces the number of potential partners for
genes of interest, producing a list of targets that is highly
enriched in physically interacting proteins. On the other
hand, compared to multiple species co-expression analysis, it retains a comparable specificity, but can find candidate partners for a greater number of genes. Since the
number of candidate partners obtained by this analysis is,
on average, in the range of standard experimental validation techniques, we believe CLOE represents a useful tool
for the exploration of gene function.

Methods
Definition of orthologous ESTs
The first step of our procedure is the identification of
orthologous ESTs in the two datasets. Although many different methods could be used to this purpose, we relied
on the InParanoid algorithm [23], which is ideally suited
for the identification of orthologous sequences between
two species. The results shown were obtained using the
pre-computed release 2.6 of the InParanoid database [24].
ESTs were linked to InParanoid clusters through their UniProt codes [25,26], and their association to UniGene
identifiers [27,28].
Choice of representative probes for the gene of interest
The procedure has been implemented for the analysis of
cDNA microarray datasets, such as those contained in the

Page 6 of 10

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/5/179

SMD [6,29]. However, it could be adapted, with minor
modifications, to the analysis of Affymetrix datasets.
Ratiometric data for the different organisms are not subjected to any further normalization, and downloaded as
log-transformed (base 2) ratios.
Within these datasets, the number of ESTs representing a
given transcription unit, as well as the number of valid
experiments for each EST, are highly variable. While this
feature would pose serious problems, if one should
attempt to average the data of all the probes belonging to
the same gene, it may offer extremely valuable information when every EST is considered independently, since
each clone explores the expression properties of a particular group of exons, in a particular combination of experimental situations.
Non-correlated or anti-correlated expression between two
well-represented EST probes belonging to the same gene
would strongly suggest that they correspond to alternatively expressed transcripts. For this reason, we decided
not to merge the data of probes belonging to the same
gene, but to treat separately every EST probe in the
datasets.
The choice of the most representative EST for the genes of
interest represents a particularly critical aspect of our procedure. If interested to a single gene, the more exhaustive
solution to this problem would be to generate and evalu-

ate a list of candidate partners for every possible pairwise
combination of ESTs probes. However, this would greatly
complicate the analysis should one be interested in analyzing the potential partners of many genes. An alternative
possibility is to focus, for every Unigene cluster, on the
most representative ESTs, i.e. the probes with the highest
number of experiments. For these reasons, the decision
about what ESTs to analyze is left to the end user.
Our implementation of the method can accept as input
both a UniGene cluster ID or the results of a BLAST search
performed with the sequence of interest against the EST
database. In both cases, it retrieves a list of all probes
found in the two datasets for the orthologous UniGene
clusters.
To help the user decide which ESTs to analyze, the program provides basic information about all the EST probes
representing the gene of interest in the two datasets. Moreover, to help the user identify the most representative EST
probe in each dataset, i.e. the probe with the highest
number of experiments, it also provides the number of
valid data points for every probe. Finally, to assess the
redundancy of the information provided by the different
probes, i.e. whether they represent different experiments
and display similar/different expression profiles, the program calculates, for every pair of probes belonging to the
same UniGene cluster, the number of common
experiments and the Pearson correlation coefficient
between their expression profiles.

Identification of orthologous sequences coexpressed in
both species

After finding representative EST clones for the gene of
interest in both species, we calculate, for each one, the
Pearson correlation coefficient (r) with every other EST in
the respective dataset. The raw r is the normalized for the
number of common data points (n) obtained for the analyzed ESTs. This is done by multiplying r for n â 1 , since
the statistical significance of r is a function of the product
n â 1 Â·r. Such normalization is particularly important
when, as in our case, n has a very wide range of variation.
The ESTs are then ranked by decreasing normalized score.
Finally, a user-defined top percentage of the two ranked
lists is compared to identify those ESTs that are associated
to the same InParanoid cluster ID. A non-redundant list of
the positive InParanoid clusters, sorted by the average
highest rank obtained in the two organisms, represents
the main output of the program (see Table 3 for an example). Clearly, the choice of the cutoff top rank percentage
represents a critical parameter, which may strongly influence the number of identified candidates. The empirical
determination of an average best cutoff is reported in the
results.
Functional characterization of the co-expressed
orthologous clusters
After obtaining a list of putative partners for the genes
under study, we analyze their functional characterization
according to the GO vocabulary [16,30]. This is very useful to obtain new insight about the putative functional
properties of the gene of interest. GO terms are associated

to ESTs through the corresponding UniProt identifiers.
For each list of candidates, we compute the prevalence of
all GO terms among the annotated ESTs, and the probability that such prevalence would occur in a randomly
chosen set of ESTs of the same size. We always consider a
gene annotated to a GO term if it is directly annotated to
it or to any of its descendants in the GO graph. For a given
GO term t let K(t) be the total number of ESTs annotated
to it in the first organism dataset that have an orthologous
sequence in the second organism dataset, and k(m, t) the
number of ESTs annotated to it in the final list S(m). If J
and j(m) denote the number of orthologous ESTs in the
dataset and in S(m) respectively, such probability is given
by the right tail of the appropriate hypergeometric
distribution:

P(J, K(t), j(m), k(m, t)) =

min(j(m),K(t))
