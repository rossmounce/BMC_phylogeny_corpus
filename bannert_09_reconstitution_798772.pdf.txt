Background
Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) are remnants
of infectious exogenous retroviruses that invaded the
germ line of human ancestors and have since been amplified and vertically transmitted. HERV-K113, a provirus
present in about 15% of humans is one of the most complete HERV-K(HML-2) elements known with open reading frames for all viral proteins. Nevertheless, it carries
inactivating postinsertional mutations.

virus and more frequent gene conversion events than
expected.

Results and conclusion
By aligning HERV-K113 with related human specific
HERV-K elements, we localized 26 putative non-synonymous postinsertional mutations and reversed them by
site-directed mutagenesis to reconstitute the original protein sequence. Using this approach, it was possible to reestablish reverse transcriptase activity, particle assembly as
well as incorporation and fusogenic function of the envelope protein. Cell lines transfected with a plasmid expressing the reconstituted HERV-K113 produced and released
C-type-like particles and reverse transcriptase activity. Protein expression and virus production was significantly
enhanced by partial codon-optimization facilitating functional studies on the envelope protein and structural studies on viral morphology. Based on over 20 sequenced
HERV-K113 ethnogeographic variants, their sequence variation and phylogeny of the postinsertional mutations
will be presented which indicates an older age of this pro-
