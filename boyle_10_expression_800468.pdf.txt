(Annelida) and Themiste lageniformis (Sipuncula)

Abstract
Background: A through gut is present in almost all metazoans, and most likely represents an ancient innovation that
enabled bilaterian animals to exploit a wide range of habitats. Molecular developmental studies indicate that Fox and
GATA regulatory genes specify tissue regions along the gut tube in a broad diversity of taxa, although little is known
about gut regionalization within the Lophotrochozoa. In this study, we isolated FoxA and GATA456 orthologs and used
whole mount in situ hybridization during larval gut formation in two marine worms: the segmented, polychaete
annelid Chaetopterus, which develops a planktotrophic larva with a tripartite gut, and the non-segmented sipunculan
Themiste lageniformis, which develops a lecithotrophic larva with a U-shaped gut.
Results: FoxA and GATA456 transcripts are predominantly restricted to gut tissue, and together show regional
expression spanning most of the alimentary canal in each of these lophotrochozoans, although neither FoxA nor
GATA456 is expressed in the posterior intestine of Chaetopterus. In both species, FoxA is expressed at the blastula stage,
transiently in presumptive endoderm before formation of a definitive gut tube, and throughout early larval
development in discrete foregut and hindgut domains. GATA456 genes are expressed during endoderm formation, and
in endoderm and mesoderm associated with the midgut in each species. Several species-specific differences were
detected, including an overlap of FoxA and GATA456 expression in the intestinal system of Themiste, which is instead
complimentary in Chaetopterus. Other differences include additional discrete expression domains of FoxA in
ectodermal trunk cells in Themiste but not Chaetopterus, and expression of GATA456 in anterior ectoderm and midgut
cells unique to Chaetopterus.
Conclusions: This study of gene expression in a sipunculan contributes new comparative developmental insights
from lophotrochozoans, and shows that FoxA and GATA456 transcription factors are part of an ancient patterning
mechanism that was deployed during early evolution of the metazoan through gut. The common utilization of FoxA
and GATA456 throughout gut formation by species with contrasting life history modes indicates that both genes are
core components of a gut-specific gene regulatory network in spiralians. Despite a highly conserved pattern of early
development, and probably similar ontogenic origins of gut tissue, there are molecular differences in gut
regionalization between lophotrochozoan species.
Background
Formation of a through gut was a key innovation during
the radiation of the Metazoa. Although the origins of an
internal digestive tract are uncertain, it probably

occurred early in animal evolution [1,2]. Considering
this, molecular mechanisms that specify cells and tissues
of such an ancient organ system are expected to show
some level of conservation across a broad range of taxa
[1,3,4]. Multiple studies support this expectation, especially for several transcriptional regulators of endoderm
[3,5,6]. Over evolutionary time, animals generated a variety of digestive organs and adaptive feeding mechanisms

that enabled them to utilize a wide range of food sources
[9]. How different gut anatomies develop, how planktotrophic and lecithotrophic life histories influence gut
evolution, whether larval and adult intestinal systems are
fundamentally different, and which molecular mechanisms explain the variation in gut morphology between
closely related animals are still not well understood. In a
previous study [10], we described morphologic and
molecular aspects of gut development in the marine polychaete, Capitella teleta Blake, Grassle & Eckelbarger
2009, known for years as Capitella sp. I. In this paper, we
extend that work with developmental data obtained from
two additional marine worms.
The 'segmented' annelid worms are one of the most
speciose and ecologically diversified protostome animal
groups, and are well represented within one of three
metazoan superclades, the understudied Lophotrochozoa
[11]. One of our study species is the parchment worm,
Chaetopterus variopedatus Cuvier 1827, sensu Enders
(1909), which M. E. Petersen (personal communication)
suggested is most likely not C. variopedatus, but an undescribed species. We refer to this polychaete as
Chaetopterus, a marine annelid that has been used both
in classic [12-14] and more recent [15-18] developmental
studies. Chaetopterus lives in U-shaped tubes within sublitorral, mud-bottom habitats along the Northeast Atlantic coastline and presumably is a broadcast spawner [19].
Recent phylogenetic analyses consider the Chaetopteridae as one of the more basal annelid groups [20].
The second species is a sipunculan worm, Themiste
lageniformis Baird 1868, for which there are a few studies
describing its reproduction [21,22] and general patterns
of development [21,23]. Adult females of T. lageniformis
are considered to reproduce by facultative parthenogenesis, and both sexes are distributed in benthic marine habitats along coastlines of Africa, India, Indo-Pacific,
Hawaii and Florida [21,24]. The occurrence of fossil
sipunculans from the Lower Cambrian implies they are
an ancient group of animals [25], and may be the sister
group to annelids [26]. However, an accumulation of data
from morphologic [27-30], mitochondrial [31,32] and
molecular phylogenetic sources [20,33-35] suggest that
the monophyletic Sipuncula [36] belong within Annelida,
although they are not consistently affiliated with any particular annelid group.
These two species provide a valuable comparison for
examining the evolutionary development of gut formation because Chaetopterus and T. lageniformis develop
very different larval and adult gut morphologies. Descriptions of larval morphology [37], anatomy [38] and development [15,39,40] demonstrate that Chaetopterus larvae
form a functional, tripartite intestinal system consisting
of the pharynx, midgut and hindgut. The larvae of T.

Page 2 of 18

lageniformis form a U-shaped gut without distinct compartments [23]. Moreover, their respective life histories
are dissimilar. Chaetopterus larvae are planktotrophic,
begin feeding within 36 hours of development, and they
are capable of extended planktonic periods exceeding 30
days [40]. The unique pelagosphera larvae of T. lageniformis are lecithotrophic, swimming on or near the bottom in laboratory cultures for up to 9 days [41], and do
not feed until after metamorphosis. In both species,
metamorphosis includes substantial changes in gut morphology between larval and juvenile forms.
We are interested in understanding the molecular basis
for distinct regional differences in gut morphology.
Important candidate genes likely to be involved in gut
regionalization include both Fox and GATA factors. The
FoxA ('Forkhead box' A) gene belongs to a multi-family
group of 'winged-helix' transcription factors with structurally similar 110-amino acid DNA-binding domains
[42,43]. GATA genes belong to a family of transcription
factors with one or two class IV zinc-finger motifs [44].
Individual GATA factors are typically assigned to one of
two subclasses, GATA1/2/3 or GATA4/5/6 [44], and their
evolution has been described in detail [45]. Both FoxA
and GATA456 gene members are part of a larger endomesoderm specification network of genes that have been
shown to have regulatory roles in endoderm and mesoderm formation during embryogenesis and larval morphogenesis in a nematode [46], fly [47], sea urchin [48-50]
and frog [51], and are expressed in similar tissues in many
other animals. Within Annelida, gene expression data
suggest that two paralogs of FoxA are in gut precursor
cells of Hydroides elegans [52], and there is mesodermal,
although no endoderm expression, of a GATA456
ortholog in Platynereis dumerilii [53]. Only for the polychaete C. teleta are there expression data for transcription factors from both gene families, and their patterns
are clearly implicated in gut formation and regionalization [10].
In this study, we isolated and identified FoxA and
GATA456 orthologs from Chaetopterus and T. lageniformis. We then characterized their expression patterns
to help clarify whether these genes in annelids have the
potential to act as conserved or novel key regulators of
the gut developmental process [50,54,55]. We also
describe gut formation for both species to guide interpretation of in situ hybridization patterns. In each worm,
FoxA and GATA456 factors show a pattern of regionalized expression in both ectodermal and endodermal
domains of the developing gut tube. We interpret these
expression patterns in the context of life history mode
and the inherent morphogenesis associated with gut formation. This is the first report of any gene expression
from a member of the Sipuncula.

Results
Larval gut formation in Chaetopterus

The anatomy and morphology of post-gastrulation larval
development in Chaetopterus has been documented [40].
Here, we describe the general features of gut formation
during the early stages of embryonic and larval growth,
and add to the published staging system to emphasize gut
characteristics pertinent to this study (Figure 1). After
gastrulation, the stomodeum is detectable approximately
11 hours post-fertilization, and is formed as an invagination on the posterior ventral face of the embryo. During
the developmental period, from 15 hours through the
early L1 stage, the stomodeum elongates in an anteriordorsal direction through the larva's interior (Figure 1B,
C). At the same time, the region of yolk-rich endoderm
cells is shifted posteriorly (Figure 1C), where they will
form the midgut. In the late L1, the dorsal-most end of
the stomodeum is directly anterior and adjacent to a
midgut epithelium, which is now circular and encloses
the midgut cavity (Figure 1D, E). The hindgut has a ciliated canal (not shown) but no obvious epithelium or

lumen is visible with differential interference contrast
(DIC) optics at this stage. Both the stomodeum and
midgut lumens are lined with cilia in late L1 larvae. In L2
larvae, the gut is functional [40]. At its opening on the
ventral face, the stomodeum extends laterally across most
of the width of the larva, and its ciliated canal narrows as
it extends inward (Figure 1A, F, G). There is a valve on the
floor of the stomodeal canal at the foregut-midgut junction [40]. The L2 midgut is lined with relatively long cilia,
and its lumen forms a large conspicuous cavity in the
larva's midbody (Figure 1F, G). The hindgut is positioned
directly posterior to the midgut, and its lumen becomes
visible and lined with cilia at L2 (Figure 1F, G). The
midgut and hindgut are connected by a canal that passes
through the ventral posterior epithelium of the midgut. A
rectal canal connects the ventral posterior hindgut cavity
to the anus, and exits the larva through the dorsal epidermis, anterior to the pygidium (Figure 1F). The entire
length of the gut is ciliated. All of the above features are
present and more pronounced in the L3 larva of
Chaetopterus (Figure 1A, H, I).

General characteristics of reproduction, development
and metamorphosis in Themiste lageniformis were previously described as part of a doctoral dissertation [23].
Here, we describe both embryonic and larval aspects of
gut formation during pre-metamorphic development in
T. lageniformis. To guide our interpretations of gene
expression for this species, we have generated a developmental staging system representing early cleavage
through larval development (Figure 2A) that includes diagrammatic views and descriptions of prominent stagespecific features (Figure 2B). Additionally, we provide
detailed confocal micrographs emphasizing gut morphogenesis for selected stages (Figure 3). The pelagosphera
larva of T. lageniformis is lecithotrophic and non-feeding,
and therefore the gut is non-functional until the juvenile
stages.
Approximately 2 hours after chemically activating (see
Methods) mature oocytes of T. lageniformis, a unipolar
cleavage furrow moves across the egg surface, initiating a
conserved program of spiral, holoblastic cleavage. At the
completion of first cleavage, a single polar body is visible
on the animal pole and the egg is divided into a large CD
cell and a smaller AB cell (Figure 2B). The D cell is the
largest blastomere at the four-cell stage, and at eight cells,
micromeres of the A, B and C quadrants are larger than
their respective macromeres, with the D macromere
being the largest of all eight blastomeres (not shown). In
mid blastula (stage 1), a single polar body identifies the
animal pole, and relatively large, yolky cells are positioned
at the vegetal pole (Figure 2B). During late stage 2, gastru-

on the embryo's ventral posterior face, and initially
extends in a dorsal-anterior direction under the posterior
rim of a band of conspicuously large, non-ciliated prototroch cells (Figure 2B, Figure 3A-C). The pretrochal

anterior end of the stage 3 embryo is marked by an apical
groove [56] between the animal pole and the prototroch.
Internally, there is a centralized yolk-rich region visible in
both live and fixed specimens (Figure 2B, Figure 3C), and
presumptive mesoderm cells flank each side of the endoderm (Figure 3C). Stage 4 is characterized by an episphere with a pair of larval eyes, a band of large
prototroch cells, bilateral sets of retractor muscle fibers
on each side of the endoderm, and a circumferential band
of non-ciliated metatrochal cells directly posterior to the
prototroch (Figure 2B, Figure 3D-F). The stomodeum is
rimmed with ciliated cells, and forms a 'bowl-shaped'
cavity that interrupts the ventral-most pair of prototroch
cells (Figure 2B, Figure 3D). The stomodeum is closed at
its dorsal end, where it is lined with a rosette of larger
cells (Figure 3F). Endoderm cells are situated in the yolky
interior, posterior to the stomodeum, although they are
difficult to visualize at this stage. Between stages 4 and 5,
the hyposphere extends in a posterior direction, producing a conical-shaped embryo. The stomodeum is broader
and extends deeper interiorly; however, it is still closed at
its dorsal end where it abuts a group of interior cells (Figure 2B, Figure 3G-I). The ventral pair of head retractor
muscles wrap around the stomodeal cavity at their anterior end (Figure 2G). Presumptive endoderm cell nuclei
are located to the interior of the dorsal wall of the stomodeum, but are not detected in the central trunk region
posterior to the metatrochal band (Figure 3H, I).
Stage 6 represents a transition to the pelagosphera
larva, and is considered analogous to the first of two 'metamorphic' stages in many sipunculans [56]. The large prototroch cells are still present but reduced in size, and the
metatroch is now ciliated. Repeated extensions and contractions of the body gradually cast off part of the egg
envelope on the anterior end, and a larval cuticle is
formed around the body [23]. At this stage, the stomodeum is open to the environment and lined with cilia at the
surface. The interior of the stomodeum is packed with
cells and now is oriented along the anterior-posterior (A/
P) axis (Figure 2B, Figure 3J). The midgut contains
numerous endoderm nuclei, and extends from the stomodeum through the trunk to the dorsal posterior side of the
larva, narrowing along the A/P axis (Figure 3J). At stage 7,
the large prototroch cells are reduced or lost, and ciliated
cells surround the mouth and form a new prototrochal
band that encircles the head. The metatroch is active, and
propels the larva during crawling or gliding motions
along the substrate surface. The ventral nerve cord is
apparent as a condensation of nuclei along the ventral
midline of the trunk. The foregut is packed with cells that
will form the esophagus, and the midgut sweeps from
ventral anterior to dorsal posterior (Figure 2B). Stage 8
larvae swim into the water column. These larvae now
have an elongate esophagus region that extends posteri-

Page 5 of 18

orly from the mouth to the intestine, which broadens at
its posterior end and then narrows as it curves toward the
larva's dorsal-posterior body wall (Figure 2B, Figure 3K,
L). Williams [23] described both yolk granules and lipid
droplets within membrane-bound gut cells, and we see
yolky endoderm cells and cell nuclei (Figure 3K, L) dispersed along the length of the intestine. It is also clear
from viewing live specimens that there is a considerable
amount of yolk moving freely within the coelom. The pelagosphera larva at stage 9 has numerous cilia surrounding the mouth and ventral face of the head, also present in
stages 7 to 8, and an actively beating metatrochal band
(Figure 2B, Figure 3M). A thick cuticle covers the body,
and at the posterior end there is a terminal organ, which
serves the larva as an adhesive mechanism for attachment to the substrate [56]. The relatively compact esophagus is oriented in an anterior-posterior direction, and is
constricted at its junction with the intestine (Figure 3M).
The intestine is broader along its anterior section, narrows at the posterior end of the descending arm, and then
curves and ascends toward its terminus where the rectum
and anus will develop (Figure 2B, Figure 3M). Larvae at
stages 8 and 9 are capable of fully retracting their anterior
ends, which temporarily repositions most of the gut tube
within the posterior end of the coelomic cavity.
Characterization and orthology assignment of FoxA and
GATA genes

cDNA fragments of Fox and GATA transcription factor
genes were isolated from the polychaete, Chaetopterus,
and the sipunculan, T. lageniformis. Sequence analyses
for all recovered Fox factors confirmed the presence of a
characteristic 110-amino acid winged-helix domain. An
amino acid alignment containing the winged-helix
domains from both worms, along with similar domains in
FoxA genes from additional metazoan taxa, was analyzed
with Bayesian statistics and supports the identity of FoxA
family members from both species (Figure 4A). The
GATA factors were each observed to have a dual C4 zincfinger domain, and a similar statistical analysis of these
zinc-finger domains confirmed our recovery of GATA
factors in the GATA4/5/6 subclass from each species
(Figure 4B). Posterior probability (PP) values for internal
nodes within each unrooted cladogram were moderately
supportive for gene-specific associations between taxa;
however there was 100% PP for a distinct FoxA family
and two GATA subclasses, which strongly supports the
respective orthology assignments for the genes we examine in this study. Although not described in detail here, a
single gene from both worm species was also isolated and
identified as a member of the GATA1/2/3 subclass, and
we included Cht-GATA123a in this analysis to help
resolve the two distinct GATA subclasses (Figure 4B).
The Chaetopterus FoxA gene, Cht-FoxA, has a predicted

factor genes, Tl-GATA456a and Tl-GATA456b, contain
ORFs of 2193 bp and 1491 bp, respectively.
Developmental expression of Cht-FoxA and Cht-GATA456a

The FoxA ortholog in Chaetopterus is expressed within
macromeres on the vegetal plate of the 4 hour late cleavage-stage embryo (Figure 5A). In the 6 hour gastrula, the
expression domain includes both surface and subsurface
cells on the vegetal face (Figure 5B). In the 15 hour
embryo, Cht-FoxA is expressed in surface cells surrounding the stomodeum and within stomodeal cells that are
internalized during elongation of the stomodeum (Figure
5C, D). Cht-FoxA is also expressed in distinct ventral surface cells at the posterior-most edge of the stomodeal
expression domain, and internally within the yolky endoderm region, dorsal to the stomodeum (Figure 5C, D). In

the early 24 to 25 hour L1 larva, Cht-FoxA is expressed in
surface cells on the lateral and posterior sides of the stomodeum, and along all internal sides of the stomodeal
canal (Figure 5E, F). At the same time, there is expression
in a distinct subset of posterior subsurface cells on the
ventral midline. As the stomodeum continues to elongate,
Cht-FoxA expression persists in the epithelial cells of the
stomodeum and appears in several cells at the location of
the presumptive hindgut (Figure 5G, H). In the functional
gut of the L2 larva, expression includes ventral and lateral
foregut epithelia, cells along the foregut roof, and pharyngeal diverticula lining dorsal margins of the foregut cavity
(Figure 5I-K). Additionally, Cht-FoxA is expressed in a
ring of cells surrounding the rectal canal (Figure 5K, L).
These same foregut and hindgut expression domains are
maintained in early-stage L3 larvae of Chaetopterus (Figure 5M, N).
The one Chaetopterus GATA456 ortholog we recovered
is expressed in both endodermal and mesodermal cells.
In the 4 hour embryo, Cht-GATA456a appears to be
expressed in all four macromeres, and in 4a, 4b and 4c

micromeres on the vegetal plate (Figure 6A). At 6 h, ChtGATA456a is expressed in a discrete cluster of vegetal
cells both on and below the surface during gastrulation
(Figure 6B, C). After 11 hours of development, the
expression domain is completely internalized (Figure 6D).
There are three domains of expression in the 15 hour
embryo. Cht-GATA456a is expressed in the central yolkrich endoderm and in a bilateral pattern in single cells on
the lateral posterior sides of the more prominent endoderm domain (Figure 6E). There is also bilateral expression in ectodermal patches on the dorsal anterior surface
of the embryo (Figure 6F). In early L1 larval stages, ChtGATA456a is expressed predominantly in the centralized
endoderm and in separate lateral patches of cells adjacent
to, but outside of the endoderm (Figure 6G-I). Each lat-

eral patch shows expression in 1 to 2 cells, and each patch
appears to be separated from the endodermal domain by
non-expressing cells (Figure 6I). In mid-stage L1 larvae,
Cht-GATA456a is expressed in the epithelium surrounding the midgut cavity, with higher expression levels at
foregut-midgut and midgut-hindgut junctions (Figure 6J,

although higher transcription levels of Cht-GATA456a at
the major gut compartment transitions are more pronounced, with lower levels of expression in remaining
areas of the midgut epithelia (Figure 6L, M). In the L3
stage, Cht-GATA456a is prominently expressed in four

comparatively large midgut cells on the ventral anterior
face and lateral anterior sides of the midgut (Figure 6N,
inset). Across specimens, these cells are consistent in
their relative positions, they are distinct in size and morphology from other midgut cells, and one or both of the
ventral pair is often found to be binucleate (data not
shown). The expression of Cht-GATA456a in individual
midgut epithelial cells (Figure 6N) and cells at the gut
compartment junctions (Figure 6O) are still obvious in L3
larvae. From a dorsal view, Cht-GATA456a expression is
also apparent in a bilateral pair of cell patches adjacent to
the pharyngeal diverticula on the dorsal posterior head
region (Figure 6P). At the foregut-midgut transition in L3
larvae, Cht-GATA456a is expressed in epithelial cells on
the midgut side and in two or more valve cells of the
pharynx (Figure 6Q).
Developmental expression of Tl-FoxA, Tl-GATA456a and TlGATA456b

The transcription of Tl-FoxA in T. lageniformis was initially detected on the vegetal hemisphere of blastulae. In
these stage 1 embryos, Tl-FoxA is consistently expressed
in a pair of vegetal cells that are separated from each
other by a relatively large blastomere that does not
express Tl-FoxA (Figure 7A, B). Within the cells, Tl-FoxA
is expressed in cytoplasm surrounding each cell nucleus
(Figure 7B). After gastrulation at stage 3, Tl-FoxA is
expressed on the anterior and lateral sides of the stomodeum in a band of cells spanning the ventral side of the
embryo (Figure 7C, D), and there is internal expression
that extends dorsally within subsurface cells of the stomodeum (Figure 7D). The lateral band of expression is
parallel with and adjacent to the posterior margin of prototroch precursor cells (Figure 7C). In early stage 4
embryos, Tl-FoxA is expressed in subsurface cells on all
sides of the stomodeum, in a bilaterally symmetric pair of
subsurface cell patches posterior to the stomodeal
expression, and in a broad expression domain within the
interior of the embryo (Figure 7E, F). Tl-FoxA is
expressed within four regions of late stage 4 embryos: the
stomodeum, endoderm, putative proctodeum cells and a
bilateral pair of 2 to 3 cells situated below the surface on
the posterior ventral side (Figure 7G, H). Expression at
the proctodeal region extends into ectoderm cells but is
not detectable at the surface. The stomodeum expression
is subsurface in cells lining a 'bowl-shaped' depression
that is partially enclosed by a band of large prototroch
cells. During stage 5, the embryo extends in a posterior
direction, forming an overall conical shape, Tl-FoxA
expression persists in the stomodeum and ventral ectoderm cells, and there is detectable labeling at the site of
future hindgut formation (Figure 7I, J). Tl-FoxA expression extends internally from the stomodeum in a dorsalanterior direction where many of the midgut endoderm
cells are positioned (Figure 7J). In stage 6, a combination

sumptive hindgut cells during this transition from the
trochophore-like stage to the early pelagosphera larval
form (Figure 7K, L). Expression in ventral ectoderm is
still visible, and it is now obvious that this domain is in
the ventral nerve cord. All of the above expression
domains are maintained in crawling pelagosphera larvae
at stage 7, which show the highest levels of expression in
foregut and presumptive hindgut tissue (Figure 7M, N).
In the swimming pelagosphera, Tl-FoxA is predominantly
expressed in the foregut, with diminished levels of
expression in posterior intestinal tissue. The foregut
expression domain includes the main posteriorly
descending region and a distinct band of Tl-FoxA expression on the anterior side of the mouth that was previously
part of a larger expression domain in the stomodeum of
pre-larval stages (Figure 7O; see also Figure 7K-M).
The expression of Tl-GATA456a appears to be
restricted to endoderm cells and tissues during formation
of the midgut. In the stage 3 post-gastrula of T. lageniformis, there is a pattern of broad expression that correlates with the centralized yolky region (Figure 8A). At
stage 4, the expression domain of Tl-GATA456a is more
condensed and clearly internal when examined from lateral, dorsal or anterior views (Figure 8B, C). This domain
is dorsal to the stomodeum and spans the posterior margin of the large band of prototroch cells. During posterior
elongation in stage 5, Tl-GATA456a expression remains
primarily dorsal to the stomodeum, has a consistent diagonal orientation relative to the dorsal-ventral (D/V) axis,
and is in the anterior of the embryo (Figure 8E-G). Once
presumptive midgut cells are repositioned to the posterior during stage 6, Tl-GATA456a expression is restricted
to the trunk region, where the midgut is developing (Figure 8H, I). In the young pelagosphera of stage 7, the
expression domain follows the contour of the midgut,
which sweeps from ventral anterior to dorsal posterior
along the A/P axis (Figure 8J). The midgut expression
domain is internal and does not extend to the larval body
wall (Figure 8J, K). At stage 8, the overall expression level
of Tl-GATA456a is lower than in previous stages, and
occurs predominantly along both descending and ascending portions of the presumptive intestine (Figure 8L). As
with previous stages, there is no expression of TlGATA456a on the dorsal posterior body wall at the position of the future anus (see Figure 8H, J, L).
The expression pattern of Tl-GATA456b overlaps with
the endodermal expression observed for Tp-GATA456a;
however, there is an additional expression domain for TlGATA456b in the mesoderm. In stage 3 embryos, TlGATA456b is expressed in several cells positioned dorsal
to the stomodeum and within the central yolk-rich inte-

cells and together form an overall 'V' shape from anterior
to posterior (Figure 9C). The cone-shaped stage 5 embryo
has a diagonal expression pattern along the D/V axis that
is dorsal to the stomodeum (Figure 9E). From a dorsal
view, this stage 5 pattern shows two bands of labeled cells
that extend posteriorly from the centralized domain (Figure 9F). There is also a bilateral pair of labeled patches
outside the central yolky region and separate from the
medial domain of Tl-GATA456b expression (Figure 9G).
During the stage 6 transformation to the early pre-pelagosphera larva, expression is repositioned to the posterior trunk region and is no longer distinguishable as two
separate domains (Figure 9H, I). There is a patchy distribution of GATA456b-positive cells in the presumptive
midgut, before the formation of a midgut epithelium
takes place. As with previous stages, expression domains
in stage 6 are internal to the ectoderm and do not overlap
with any stomodeal cells. Stage 7 pelagospherae show TlGATA456b expression that extends along the midgut
from the posterior end of the foregut to the terminal end
of the presumptive hindgut (Figure 9J, K). In the swimming pelagosphera, the expression of Tl-GATA456b is
reduced but still detectable in the intestine along most of
its length, including anterior expression at the esophagus-intestine junction and in posterior cells in the
ascending arm of the intestine (Figure 9L).

Discussion
In this study, we provide novel information on gut development in the sipunculan, Themiste lageniformis, which
supplements previous work [23]. Using labeling techniques and confocal microscopy, we identified presumptive endoderm and mesoderm cells relative to positional
landmarks such as the apical groove, stomodeum, muscle
retractors and metatrochal cells. In the trochophore-like
stage before elongation, endodermal cells are located
adjacent and posterior to brain cells in the anterior of the
animal. In lecithotrophic pelagospherae, there is a compact aggregation of stomodeal cells occluding the presumptive esophagus, whereas a symmetric epithelium
lines the foregut canal in the planktotrophic larval digestive system of Chaetopterus. The posterior end of the larval gut in Themiste is initially positioned midway along
the dorsal trunk body wall, and both the intestine and larval body elongate posterior to the anal region resulting in
the U-shaped gut in adults, a morphology that is considered to be an important adaptation among tubular burrow-dwelling sipunculans [57]. By contrast, the linear gut
of polychaetes usually terminates within or immediately
adjacent to the pygidium at the worm's posterior end [58],
even when the anus is positioned dorsally, such as in the
larvae of tubiculous species (such as serpulids and
chaetopterids). By comparing gut formation in
Chaetopterus, Themiste and Capitella teleta [10], it is

Boyle and Seaver EvoDevo 2010, 1:2
http://www.evodevojournal.com/content/1/1/2

clear that a distinct digestive architecture develops in the
larvae of each worm, which may correspond with divergent life history modes and feeding mechanisms.
Our results reveal that differences among species in gut
architecture are mirrored in the expression patterns of
regulatory 'gut genes.' During early development, FoxA
family orthologs are expressed in the vegetal plate blastomeres of Chaetopterus, Themiste and Capitella; however,
FoxA expression in the endoderm of Themiste is more
persistent and extensive. In endodermal cells of
Chaetopterus and Capitella, FoxA appears to be downregulated shortly after gastrulation and well before a gut
tube is detectable, yet FoxA transcripts are expressed in
the endoderm of Themiste during midgut morphogenesis. This could reflect a longer duration of lecithotrophic
development, later onset of feeding, and/or the unique
anatomy of sipunculan coiled-helix intestinal systems
[56,57,59,60]. Species variation of FoxA expression in the
foregut is less apparent and may simply be related to the
time for completion of a functional gut, which requires
1.5 days, 9 days and 2 to 3 weeks in Chaetopterus, Capitella and Themiste, respectively. In Chaetopterus, FoxA is
expressed in the stomodeum 11 hours after fertilization,
well before a distinct foregut epithelium is apparent (27
to 28 hours post-fertilization) and later FoxA is expressed
at the oral surface in feeding larvae. By contrast, the stomodeum and foregut epithelium are formed after approximately 4 and 5 days, respectively, in the lecithotrophic
metatrochophore of Capitella, and a distinct foregut epithelium is not even visible in the lecithotrophic pelagosphera of Themiste. The FoxA gene is also expressed
throughout foregut morphogenesis in these two worms,
although expression does not extend to the stomodeal
surface cells as it does in Chaetopterus. Different polychaete species of Hydroides (for example, H. hexagonus;
H. uncinata) generate planktonic trochophores with a tripartite gut 20 hours after fertilization [61]http://hdl.handle.net/1912/295 and H. elegans has the ability to feed
after just 9 hours (B. Nedved, personal communication).
Accordingly, Arenas-Mena [52] found high levels of FoxA
(He-FoxA1 and He-FoxA2) expression in foregut and
endoderm precursors in 3 to 4 hour blastulae of H. elegans, although endoderm expression was transient and
declined shortly after gastrulation in that polychaete as
well. Thus, in the foregut domains of the species mentioned here, FoxA is commonly expressed during a broad
temporal window from cleavage through larval development, regardless of developmental mode or tempo. In
contrast, in the midgut endoderm of Themiste, there
seems to be a heterochronic shift in the duration of FoxA
expression relative to expression in the endoderm of
polychaetes.
The FoxA gene is also expressed in the hindgut of
Chaetopterus, Themiste, Capitella [10] and H. elegans

Page 11 of 18

[52], yet it extends much further internally into presumptive intestinal endoderm in Themiste. During stages 6 to 8
in the pelagosphera of Themiste, FoxA is expressed along
the majority of the length of the gut, contrasting with the
more restricted, separate foregut and hindgut expression
domains of FoxA in Chaetopterus and Capitella. Sipunculans generally have a complex hindgut region in which
highly folded, ciliated columnar epithelia and more
extensive musculature develop [59]. A FoxA ortholog is
expressed in both ciliated columnar epithelia and highly
muscularized tissues of the pharynx in Capitella [10];
however, there is no comparable pharyngeal anatomy in
Themiste or adult sipunculans [57]. It will be informative
to examine FoxA expression in the larvae of sipunculan
species that have a pharynx, which includes muscularized
feeding structures such as the buccal organ and lip gland
[29,56,59], to see if there is a significant shift in the
amount and extent of FoxA expression between anterior
and posterior regions in different sipunculans.
In all three species we have examined, FoxA expression
in the posterior gut is interior to surface ectoderm and
may have a role in specifying the transition between
hindgut/rectum and anus. In Drosophila, there is a 'constellation' of regulatory and signaling genes (caudal,
FoxA/forkhead, brachyenteron, wingless, hedgehog, dpp)
that comprise a regulatory network controlling gastrulation and hindgut development [62-65]. In Capitella, there
is FoxA expression in posterior endoderm and ectoderm,
where the hindgut meets cells of the anus. Here, FoxA
appears to be co-expressed with caudal (cdx) in this posterior domain [66], and it both precedes and overlaps
with posterior expression of hedgehog (hh), which is adjacent to the expression of wingless (wg/Wnt1) in the anus
[67]. This pattern implies that a gene regulatory network
similar to that in Drosophila may control hindgut formation in polychaetes. Based on the spatially and temporally
conserved patterns of FoxA expression in the hindgut and
foregut of Chaetopterus, Themiste and Capitella, we
hypothesize that FoxA acts as a key regulator of anterior
and posterior gut formation, and is not restricted to a single germ layer.
Outside the gut, FoxA is expressed in a discrete patch of
ectodermal cells on the ventral midline in stages 4 to 8 in
Themiste. Although FoxA is also expressed in several
ectoderm cells on the ventral midline of Chaetopterus,
this expression is transient and not detectable in L2 and
L3 larvae when nerve fibers appear in this region (N.
Meyer, personal communication). In Themiste, the patch
of FoxA-positive cells on the ventral midline persists
through 'first metamorphosis' and appears to correspond
with serotonergic cells of the ventral nerve cord (VNC) in
stages 6 to 7 pelagospherae (N. Meyer, personal communication). It is possible that these patterns reflect temporal differences in VNC specification between

Boyle and Seaver EvoDevo 2010, 1:2

planktotrophic (Chaetopterus) and lecithotrophic
(Themiste) development. In Themiste, FoxA is also
expressed in bilaterally symmetric cell clusters along lateral margins of the trunk in stages 6 and 7 (not shown).
This and the ectodermal expression at the ventral midline
probably correspond to components of the sipunculan
nervous system, and represent a co-option of the FoxA
gene outside its conserved role in gut development.
GATA transcription factors are expressed in both the
endoderm and mesoderm of Chaetopterus and Themiste.
We isolated a single ortholog in the GATA4/5/6 subclass
from Chaetopterus and two orthologs from Themiste,
although additional subclass members may exist. Expression of GATA factors in Themiste and Chaetopterus are
consistent with our previous findings for Capitella in
which we identified three GATA4/5/6 subclass genes
[10], each with a distinct expression pattern: Ct-gataB1 is
expressed in endoderm, Ct-gataB2 in endoderm and visceral mesoderm, and Ct-gataB3 is restricted to visceral
mesoderm. One of the GATA456 factors from Themiste,
Tl-GATA456a, appears to be more similar to one of three
GATA456 factors in Capitella than it is to known GATA
orthologs from any other polychaetes. Our amino acid
sequence analysis indicates that these genes (TlGATA456a and Ct-gataB1) are closely related orthologs
of each other. Both genes are expressed exclusively in the
endoderm, which may indicate a conserved role after
gene duplication events within this subclass of GATA factors [10,45,53]. In addition, one GATA factor each from
Chaetopterus
(Cht-GATA456a),
Themiste
(TlGATA456b) and Capitella (Ct-gataB2) is simultaneously
expressed in both endodermal and mesodermal cell types
associated with the midgut, showing conservation of an
additional GATA456 ortholog in annelid and sipunculan
gut development. In the polychaete Platynereis dumerilii,
Gillis et al. [53] identified a single GATA factor
(PdGATA456) whose expression pattern does not include
any endoderm (see below), which contrasts with endoderm expression for at least one GATA456 factor in
Chaetopterus, Themiste and Capitella.
GATA456 expression in mesoderm varies between
polychaete annelids. During early development, a stereotypic spiral cleavage program is common among annelids, sipunculans and other lophotrochozoans (for
example, echiurans, molluscs, nemerteans, polyclad turbellarians), in which the 4 d cell is termed the 'mesentoblast,' and typically gives rise to adult mesoderm [68-70].
The single GATA factor (PdGATA456) identified in
Platynereis [53] is expressed in cells of the paired mesodermal bands, "most likely in descendants of the mesodermal progenitor cells 4d1 and 4d2." An important
contrast between their study and ours is that in
Chaetopterus, Cht-GATA456a is expressed in seven vegetal-plate blastomeres, which appear to include all fourth

Page 12 of 18

quartet micromeres except 4 d, the progenitor of 4d1 and
4d2. A similar pattern was found in Capitella where CtgataB1 expression is reduced in 3 D just before the birth
of 4 d [10]. Thus, in Chaetopterus and Capitella, transcription of one GATA456 factor seems to be segregated
away from the 4 d lineage, indicating that there is speciesspecific variation of GATA456 expression in annelid
mesodermal precursors during early development. At
later stages, the expression of PdGATA456 is detectable
throughout the entire mesodermal band [53], yet the
expression of a GATA456 ortholog is clearly discontinuous among presumptive mesoderm cells flanking the
endoderm in Chaetopterus, Themiste and Capitella,
which indicates expression within a mesoderm sublineage. Moreover, Gillis et al. [53] reported that
PdGATA456 expression is associated with the segmentally repeated chaetal sacs. The segmental expression of
GATA456 is not associated with chaetal development in
Capitella or in epidermal development in the achaetous

however,
GATA456 expression has not been examined during
chaetal development in Chaetopterus.
We observed several other differences between species
in the expression patterns of FoxA and GATA456. Neither
FoxA nor Cht-GATA456a is expressed in the hindgut of
Chaetopterus, although there was GATA456 expression
in the corresponding regions of Themiste and Capitella.
There may be another GATA ortholog or even a different
regulatory gene in Chaetopterus that is expressed in this
hindgut tissue. Additionally, because there are no discrete
compartments in the larval gut of Themiste, GATA456
expression does not correlate with distinct gut compartment boundaries, whereas the segregation of FoxA and
GATA456 expression into distinct gut compartments is
definitive in Chaetopterus. The GATA456 expression pattern in the gut of Themiste may instead represent the
embryonic origin of this tissue (that is, in endodermal
precursors). Finally, in Chaetopterus, Cht-GATA456a
appears to be expressed in specialized cells in the midgut
(endoderm) and head ectoderm (neural) that are not
directly comparable to any patterns of GATA456 expression in Themiste, Capitella or Platynereis. This represents a possible co-option of the Cht-GATA456a gene in
cell types that are present in Chaetopterus but not in the
other animals. Collectively, it appears that particular
developmental roles for members of the GATA456 subclass have been partitioned among species and between
germ layers during the diversification of annelids.

Conclusions
Although we observed several species-specific differences, an overall comparison of FoxA and GATA456 transcription along the alimentary canal reveals a conserved
trend of regionalized expression in these two species (Fig-

ure 10). This trend is even more apparent when also considering the expression patterns previously described in
Capitella. FoxA appears to be involved in patterning
anterior and posterior regions of the larval digestive system, regardless of the rate of development or whether the
developmental mode is planktotrophic or lecithotrophic.
Orthologs of the GATA456 subclass also show conserved
expression localized to the midgut and a mesoderm sublineage. Both FoxA and GATA456 transcripts are largely
restricted to tissues of the gut tube, unlike other gutrelated genes, which are expressed in additional domains
external to the digestive system [3]. Together, the expression of FoxA and GATA456 span most of the length of the
gut tube in Chaetopterus, Themiste and Capitella. Furthermore, FoxA and GATA456 show spatial and temporal
overlap at the ectodermal-endodermal transitions along
the gut tube, and there is almost complete overlap in the
midgut of a sipunculan. This would suggest the possibility of transcriptional cooperation or 'genetic potentiation,' which has been characterized in detail for the

HNF3/FoxA-GATA partnership in mouse embryonic
endoderm [3,5].
It is likely that both transcription factors are near the
top of gut-specific gene regulatory networks in spiralians.
Orthologs of FoxA and GATA factors are integral components of endomesoderm networks in a nematode [46,71]
and sea urchin [50,55] and required for digestive tract
development in fly [72,73] and mouse embryos [74,75]. If
we also consider the expression patterns in embryos as
diverse as a hemichordate [76], mollusc [77,78] or an
anthozoan cnidarian [79], there is evidence of ancient
conservation or 'deep homology' [80] for the roles of
FoxA and GATA456 genes in patterning metazoan intestinal systems. Regionalized expression of FoxA and
GATA456 orthologs along the gut tube of annelid lophotrochozoans, taken together with conserved expression
patterns in ecdysozoan and deuterostome animals,
implies that a through gut may have been present during
the earliest stages of bilaterian evolution, even in the bilaterian ancestor itself. Although it is clear that lophotrochozoans use a common set of core gut patterning
components, our results reveal significant molecular differences between species and could indicate modifications leading to the evolution of diverse intestinal
systems. Investigations of genes further downstream may
uncover more dramatic species-specific differences in the
process of gut-related tissue specification or cell differentiation.

Methods
Animal collection and handling

Adult polychaete worms of Chaetopterus variopedatus
Cuvier 1827, sensu Enders (1909) were collected near
Woods Hole, MA, USA by the Marine Resources Center
at Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL). M. E. Petersen
(personal communication) examined the material from
mud bottoms in the Woods Hole region and has suggested that it probably is not C. variopedatus, but a new,
undescribed species. Mature worms were maintained in
their tubes in flowing seawater for 1 to 2 weeks. Gamete
collection, fertilization and the handling of embryos and
larvae were conducted according to published protocols
[15].
Adult sipunculan worms of Themiste lageniformis were
extracted from coral rubble found in the shallow subtidal
region along the south shore of Oahu, Hawaii. Coral
'boulders' were maintained in flowing seawater tables at
Kewalo Marine Laboratory, University of Hawaii at
Manoa for up to 1 to 2 months and broken open to collect
worms. Mature specimens were placed into glass finger
bowls containing filtered seawater (FSW; 22 μm filter) for
1 to 2 hours, followed by dissection of coelomic contents
into plastic petri dishes coated in a gelatin solution (1.0%
gelatin; 0.37% formaldehyde; dH2O). Mature oocytes

Boyle and Seaver EvoDevo 2010, 1:2
http://www.evodevojournal.com/content/1/1/2

were isolated from other coelomic materials by washing
in FSW. Embryonic development of T. lageniformis was
activated by treatment with 1.0 mM cAMP (N, 2'-Odibutyryladenosine 3': 5- cyclic monophosphate; Sigma,
St. Louis, MO, USA) in coated petri dishes containing
oocytes and FSW. cAMP stock solution was prepared at
0.5 M in dimethylformamide (DMF). cAMP treatments
were terminated after 1.5 hours by several FSW
exchanges. Developing embryos and larvae were maintained at room temperature (RT) with daily exchanges of
FSW containing antibiotics (0.6 mg/ml penicillin; 0.5 mg/
ml streptomycin). A detailed protocol is available upon
request.

using one set of 5' and 3' RACE primers designed from
the same conserved, C4 zinc-finger domain: RACE fragments of 1485 bp (3') and 1102 bp (5') for Tl-GATA456a
and 1068 bp (3') and 881 bp (5') for Tl-GATA456b were
recovered. Additional gene-specific primers were then
used to confirm the identity of each distinct Tl-GATA
factor by amplification of sequences connecting each of
the individual Tl-GATA456a and Tl-GATA456b RACE
fragments. Degenerate and RACE gene fragments
obtained from both species were subcloned into pGEM-T
Easy vectors (Promega, Madison, WIm USA) and
sequenced at Macrogen Inc. (Seoul, South Korea).
Gene orthology analyses

Cloning of FoxA and GATA456 genes

Total RNA was collected from Chaetopterus oocytes,
embryos at 3 to 9 hours post-fertilization, and mixed larval stages. 5' and 3' cDNA templates were synthesized
using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE (SMART
RACE system; Clontech, Mountainview, CA, USA). DNA
fragments of Chaetopterus FoxA and GATA456 were
recovered from the cDNA template by degenerate PCR.
A 249 bp fragment of the Cht-FoxA winged-helix domain
was isolated with the following nested primer set:
A1Fout: 5'-AAR CCN CCN TAY WSN TAY AT -3' and
A2Rout: 5'-TAR CAN CCR TTY TCR AAC AT-3', followed by A2Fin: 5'-TAY ATH WSN YTN ATH CAN ATG
-3' and A1Rin: 5'-CCR TTY TCR AAC ATR TTN CC -3'.
A 348 bp fragment of the Cht-GATA456 C4 zinc-finger
domain was isolated using the following semi-nested
primer set: GTF1out: 5'-GAR TGY GTN AAY TGY GGN
GC -3' and GTR1out: 5'-GGY TTN CKY TTN CKN GTY
GT -3', followed by GTF2in: 5'-GGN CAY TAY YTN
TGY AAY GC -3' and GTR1out. Gene-specific RACE
primers were designed (MacVector Inc., Cary, NC, USA),
synthesized (IDT, San Diego, CA, USA) and used
(Advantage® 2 PCR Kit; Clontech). RACE fragments of
1389 bp (3') and 737 bp (5') were recovered for Cht-FoxA
and fragments of 1038 bp (3') and ~ 1490 bp (5') were
recovered for Cht-GATA456a.
Total RNA was collected from T. lageniformis oocytes
and from assorted embryonic and larval stages from the
first 3 days of development. 5' and 3' RACE-Ready cDNA
templates were prepared as described for Chaetopterus.
A degenerate DNA fragment of 226 bp from the Tl-FoxA
winged-helix domain was isolated using the following
semi-nested primer set: A1Fout and A2Rout, followed by
A1Fout and A3Rin: 5'-CCA RAA NSW NCC YTT NCC
NGG -3'. A 339 bp degenerate fragment of Tl-GATA456
was isolated with the primer set: GTF1out and GTR1out.
Gene-specific RACE primers were designed and used as
previously described. RACE fragments of 1569 bp (3')
and 779 bp (5') were recovered for Tl-FoxA. Two distinct
GATA456 genes were recovered from T. lageniformis

Sequence data for all recovered gene fragments from
Chaetopterus and T. lageniformis were examined for similarity to public database protein sequences using the
blastx program of NCBI http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.
Sequence data for DNA-binding domains of the Fox
winged-helix and GATA C4 zinc-finger proteins from a
subset of additional organisms were obtained from the
NCBI Protein database (Entrez Protein). All amino acid
sequences were aligned using the ClustalW algorithm in
MacVector (version 10.6), and manually adjusted for
alignment errors.
Phylogenetic analyses of selected Fox winged-helix and
GATA zinc-finger domains were performed with
MrBayes (version 3.1.2) [81]. The Fox protein analysis
used the WAG model of amino acid replacement for
3,000,000 generations sampled every 100 generations,
with four chains and four independent runs. A 50%
majority-rule consensus tree was generated from the last
90,004 trees. The GATA protein analysis used the JTT
model of amino acid replacement for 3,000,000 generations sampled every 100 generations, with four chains
and four independent runs. A 50% majority-rule consensus tree was generated from the last 80,004 trees. Gamma
shape parameters and the proportion of invariable sites
were uniformly distributed for each analysis. The resulting consensus trees were viewed with FigTree (version
1.1.2; http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/) and edited in Adobe illustrator CS3.

Whole mount in situ hybridization

Chaetopterus embryos were pretreated with a 1:1 mixture
of 1.0 M sucrose and 0.25 M sodium citrate (Sigma, St.

hyde in FSW overnight at 4°C. Chaetopterus larvae were
relaxed in a 1:1 mixture of 0.37 M MgCl2 in FSW for 10 to
15 minutes and fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in FSW overnight at 4°C.
T. lageniformis stage 3 to 4 embryos were pretreated
with a 1:1 mixture of 100 mM sucrose:0.25 M Na citrate
for 2 to 3 minutes, washed in FSW and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in FSW. Stage 5 pre-larvae were anesthetized with 1:1 0.37 M MgCl2 in FSW for 30 to 40 minutes,
followed by a 'slow-fix' with drop-wise (5 to 10 μl) additions of 4% paraformaldehyde every 10 minutes until no
movement was detected, then fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde in FSW. Stage 6 to 8 pelagosphera larvae were
anesthetized with a 1:1:2 mixture of 0.37 M MgCl2: 0.25%
bupivicaine hydrochloride (BH; Sigma) in FSW for 1
hour, followed by fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde in
FSW. All fixations were carried out overnight at 4°C.
Specimens of both species were washed out of fixative
into phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), dehydrated stepwise into 100% methanol, and stored at -20°C. Before
hybridization, specimens were rehydrated stepwise from
methanol into PBS with 0.1% Tween-20 detergent (PTw).
Whole mount in situ hybridization was performed
according to published protocols [18,67] with several
modifications: proteinase-K digestion was terminated
after 2 minutes (Chaetopterus) or 15 minutes (T. lageniformis); acetic anhydride treatments were 6.0 μl/ml and
12.0 μl/ml triethanolamine (Chaetopterus) or 4.0 μl/ml
and 8.0 μl/ml triethanolamine (T. lageniformis); prehybridization consisted of 50% hybridization buffer for 10
minutes followed by 100% hybridization buffer overnight
(Chaetopterus) or 100% hybridization buffer overnight (T.
lageniformis). For both species, in situ hybridization was
conducted at 65°C for 72 hours, with the following color
development reaction: [4.4 μl nitroblue tetrazolium
(NBT) 75 mg/ml: 3.3 μl 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl
phosphate (BCIP) 50 mg/ml]/ml alkaline phosphatase
(AP) buffer. A detailed in situ hybridization protocol is
available upon request.
A 5' riboprobe of 737 bp was synthesized for Cht-FoxA;
a 5' riboprobe of approximately 1490 bp was synthesized
for Cht-GATA456a (each used at 0.5 ng/μl). A 3' riboprobe of 1569 bp was synthesized for Tl-FoxA (used at 1.0
ng/μl); and two 5' riboprobes of 1102 and 881 bp were
synthesized for Tl-GATA456a and Tl-GATA456b,
respectively (each used at 3.0 ng/μl). All of the antisense
digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes (dig-11-UTP) were synthesized with a T7 MEGAscript kit (Ambion Inc, Austin,
TX, USA) and detected by chromogenic staining (NBT/
BCIP) of an anti-digoxigenin antibody-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Color
reactions were terminated in PTw, followed by a graded
dilution series of hybridization buffer/PTw washes. Specimens were equilibrated and stored in glycerol (80% glyc-

erol, 10% 10X PBS, 10% diH20) and mounted on coated
slides (Rainex®; Sopus Products, Houston, TX, USA).
Microscopic analyses were performed on a compound
light microscope (Axioskop 2; Carl Zeiss, Inc. Thornwood, NY, USA) with DIC optics. Digital micrographs of
riboprobe-labeled and non-labeled, fixed animals were
captured with a stem-mounted, 4.0 megapixel digital
camera (Coolpix 4500; Nikon Inc., Melville, NY, USA).
Confocal imaging and analysis

T. lageniformis embryonic and larval stages were pretreated as previously described, fixed for 1.0 hour in 4%
paraformaldehyde in FSW at RT, and washed in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBT).
Embryos at stages 3 to 5 were blocked in PBS-T with 10%
heat-inactivated goat serum (Sigma) for 1 hour at RT, followed by consecutive overnight treatments at 4°C with
primary mouse anti-histone antibody (1:250 dilution;
F152.C25.WJJ; Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and secondary goat anti-mouse rhodamine antibody (1:200 dilution; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) in blocking
buffer. Secondary antibody was co-incubated with 1:200
BODIPY FL-phallacidin (Molecular Probes). Labeled
embryos at stages 3 to 4 were rinsed in PBS and mounted
in SlowFade Gold (Molecular Probes). Pelagosphera larvae at stages 6 to 8 were treated with RNase A at 1.0 mg/
ml PBS-T for 1 hr at 37°C, washed in PBS-T, and then
labeled with propidium iodide (Sigma)] 5 μg/ml in PBS-T
and 1:200 BODIPY FL-phallacidin for 2 hours at RT.
Stage 5 pre-larvae and pelagosphera larvae were washed
in PBS, dehydrated stepwise in isopropanol, cleared by
emersion in 2:1 benzyl benzoate:benzyl alcohol, mounted
on non-coated glass slides and sealed with clear nail polish. Visualization and imaging of all stages were performed using a confocal microscope (Axioplan 2
LSM510; Zeiss).
