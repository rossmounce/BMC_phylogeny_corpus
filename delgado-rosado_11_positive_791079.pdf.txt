Positive selection on a bacterial oncoprotein
associated with gastric cancer
Gisela Delgado-Rosado, Maria Gloria Dominguez-Bello and Steven E Massey*

Background
Helicobacter pylori is a vertically inherited gut commensal that is carcinogenic if it possesses the cag pathogenicity
island (cag PaI); infection with H.pylori is the major risk factor for gastric cancer, the second leading cause of death
from cancer worldwide (WHO). The cag PaI locus encodes the cagA gene, whose protein product is injected into
stomach epithelial cells via a Type IV secretion system, also encoded by the cag PaI. Once there, the cagA protein
binds to various cellular proteins, resulting in dysregulation of cell division and carcinogenesis. For this reason,
cagA may be described as an oncoprotein. A clear understanding of the mechanism of action of cagA and its
benefit to the bacteria is lacking.
Results: Here, we reveal that the cagA gene displays strong signatures of positive selection in bacteria isolated from
amerindian populations, using the Ka/Ks ratio. Weaker signatures are also detected in the gene from bacteria isolated
from asian populations, using the Ka/Ks ratio and the more sensitive branches-sites model of the PAML package.
When the cagA gene isolated from amerindian populations was examined in more detail it was found that the
region under positive selection contains the EPIYA domains, which are known to modulate the carcinogenicity of the
gene. This means that the carcinogenicity modulating region of the gene is undergoing adaptation. The results are
discussed in relation to the high incidences of stomach cancer in some latin american and asian populations.
Conclusion: Positive selection on cagA indicates antagonistic coevolution between host and bacteria, which
appears paradoxical given that cagA is detrimental to the human host upon which the bacteria depends. This
suggests several non-exclusive possibilities; that gastric cancer has not been a major selective pressure on human
populations, that cagA has an undetermined benefit to the human host, or that horizontal transmission of H.pylori
between hosts has been more important in the evolution of H.pylori than previously recognized, reducing the
selective pressure to lower the pathogenicity of the bacteria. The different patterns of adaptation of the gene in
different human populations indicates that there are population specific differences in the human gut environment
- due either to differences in host genetics or diet and other lifestyle features.

Introduction
Helicobacter pylori is a Gram negative bacterium that
lives in the human stomach as part of the normal gastric
microbiome [1], and is generally present in the majority
of the adult population [2]. The bacterium has co-evolved
with human populations [3] and is well adapted and largely specific to the human host. The ancestor of H.pylori
was intestinal and during its evolution migrated to the
stomach, facilitated by the evolution of a urease that
combats the stomach’s acid conditions [4,5]. H.pylori

strains may possess a cag pathogenicity island (cag PaI)
that contains a cagA gene encoding a 128 kDa protein
[6,7]. The cag PaI seems to have entered the H.pylori
genome by lateral gene transfer, after H.pylori differentiated from parental species [2,8]. Many of the genes of
the cag PAI are involved in translocation of the cagA
protein into epithelial cells lining the stomach. However,
the function of the cagA protein itself is unknown. Infection with cagA+ H.pylori is strongly associated with gastric carcinoma [9-11]; gastric carcinoma is the second
leading cause of death from cancer worldwide [12].
In addition, cagA + H.pylori is associated with chronic
gastritis and peptic ulcers [13].

The mechanism of pathogenicity of cagA+ H.pylori is as
follows. The bacteria attaches to the stomach wall and the
cagA protein is injected into an epithelial cell by a bacterial
Type IV secretion system, also encoded by the cag PaI
locus [14]. Once inside the cell, cagA is phosphorylated on
tyrosine residues located within EPIYA domains by members of the src kinases such as c-src, Fyn, Yes [15], Lyn [16]
and c-Abl [17]. The cagA protein is membrane associated
and interacts with numerous additional cellular proteins,
including the oncoprotein Src homology 2 domain containing tyrosine phosphatase (SHP-2 [18]), microtubule affinity-regulating kinase (MARK2 [19]), growth factor
receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb-2 [20]), hepatocyte growth
factor receptor (c-Met [21]), C-terminal Src kinase (Csk
[22]) and p38 (Crk [23]). Tyrosine phosphorylated cagA
recruits and activates SHP-2, apparently mimicking the
action of Gab1 [24]. Consistent with the mimicry hypothesis, cagA is able to rescue Gab1 deficient Drosophila
mutants [25], which is interesting given that cagA has no
sequence similarity with Gab1, indeed it has no known
homologs. The interaction with SHP-2 causes inhibition of
its tumor suppressing activity [18]. Epithelial cells that have
been dysregulated adopt the elongated hummingbird phenotype [26]. In addition, cagA activates the transcription
factor NF-kB leading to the induction of interleukin 8 (IL8) and subsequent inflammation [27]. The activation of
NF-kB occurs via SHP-2.
Variation in the EPIYA domains of cagA results in variation in the virulences of different cagA+ H.pylori strains
[28]. The EPIYA motifs are located in the C-terminal half
of the cagA protein and are of types A-D. The EPIYA
motifs are the major sites of tyrosine phosphorylation
within the cagA protein. The eastern EPIYA-D motif,
found in asian populations, is associated with stronger
binding to SHP-2, while the western EPIYA-C motif is
not. The presence of the EPIYA-D motif in asian cagA
sequences may be responsible for the high rates of H.pylori
associated disease in asian populations [28].
The study reported here investigates the evolutionary
dynamics of the cagA gene from different human populations, and shows that the gene displays varying amounts of
positive selection, implying host population genetic differences in the response to H.pylori infection, and indicating
the benefit of the gene to H.pylori. The region of the cagA
gene under selection contains the EPIYA domains. These
observations are an apparent paradox, given the detrimental effects of the oncoprotein on the human host; various
scenarios are discussed that may explain the data.

Methods
Sequences and phylogenetic analysis

Complete cagA sequences from different human populations were obtained from the Genbank database (NCBI)
and are listed in Table 1. Although isolated from a

white american from Tennessee, the USA sequence has
an african origin [29], hence it is denoted African(USA).
There were two cagA genes in the Peruvian genome,
denoted Peru1 and Peru2. There is an additional cagA
gene in the Venezuelan genome, however this is likely
to be a pseudogene because of a 119 amino acid deletion on the N terminus. Searching of the Genbank database, and other Helicobacter species did not reveal a
significant homolog of cagA. DNA alignments were constructed by first aligning the protein sequences, using
the MAFFT program [30], and then using this alignment
as a template for a DNA alignment, using the PAL2NL
program [31]. Bayesian phylogenetic inference of the
cagA DNA sequences was conducted using the program
MrBayes [32], using a GTR substitution model and a
gamma parameter of 0.84, selected using the jModelTest
program [33]. The simulation was run for 90000 generations, sampling every 100 generations. A burn-in of 25%
was conducted and the consensus tree was constructed
from the last 25% of the sampled generations.
Partial rRNA sequences for various Helicobacter species were obtained from Genbank; these were H.fennelliae (GenBank: AF348747), H.acinocychis (GenBank:
NR_025940), H.pylori (GenBank: DQ202383), H.nemestrinae (GenBank: AF363064), H.heilmannii (GenBank:
AF506794), H.cetorum (GenBank: FN565164), Helicobacter sp. ‘solnick 9A1-T71’ (GenBank: AF292381), H.bizzozeronii (GenBank: NR026372), H.salomonis (GenBank:
NR026065) and H.felis (GenBank: NR025935). The
sequences were aligned using the MAFFT program and
phylogenetic relationships determined using MrBayes
and a HKY model, selected using the jModelTest program. The simulation was run for 10000 generations,
sampling every 100 generations. A burn-in of 25% was

conducted and the consensus tree was constructed from
the last 25% of the sampled generations.
Positive selection analysis

The cagA gene sequences were analyzed for the presence
of positive selection by likelihood ratio testing, comparing
nested models, null and alternative, using the PAML program [34]. Three tests were performed; the branches test
[35,36], sites test [37] and branches-sites test [38]. An
unrooted tree without branch lengths was used for the
analysis, generated by the phylogenetic analysis, and the
codon frequency table option was utilized in all analyses.
Likelihood ratio testing was conducted to determine the
signficance of 2Δl, the differences between the log likelihoods of the two models (where l is the log likelihood),
using a c2 distribution with 12 degrees of freedom for
the branches model, a c2 distribution and 2 degrees of
freedom for the sites model and a c2 distribution with 1
degree of freedom for the branches-sites model. The null
model used for the branches test was a one-ratio model
where Ka/Ks (ω) was the same for all branches, while the
alternative model was the free-ratio model where ω was
allowed to vary. The null model for the sites test was
model 1a (neutral; model = 0, NSsites = 1, fix_omega =
0), and the alternative model was model 2a (selection;
model = 0, NSsites = 2, fix_omega = 0). The null model
for the branches-sites test was modified according to
Yang et al. [39] (neutral; model = 2, NSsites = 2, fix_omega = 1, omega = 1). The alternative model was model
A (selection; model = 2, NSsites = 2, fix_omega = 0).

Results and discussion
Positive selection on cagA

The topology of the phylogenetic tree of the complete H.
pylori cagA sequences reproduces the relationships
between different human populations around the world
(Figure 1), and is consistent with larger scale studies using
concatenated sequences that show that H.pylori has comigrated with humans after their exit from Africa [3]. The
reproduction of the evolutionary history of the human
populations in the topology of the cagA tree therefore is
the result of the tight association of H.pylori with its host
[3,40,41]. The cagA sequence obtained from an Indian
individual is located within the clade formed by european
sequences, consistent with results showing that Indian
cagA sequences intercalate with european sequences [42]
and that most H.pylori from India are related to european
strains [43]. The tree also indicates that the Peruvian cagA
sequence has undergone a recent gene duplication; this is
seen in the operon structure (Figure 2). Strong positive
selection on Peru2 indicates that neofunctionalization of
the gene is occurring. Presumably, the gene duplication
results in gene dosage effects; how this affects the pathogenicity of the strain in unclear. The presence of a

Page 3 of 10

pseudogenized cagA gene in the H.pylori genome isolated
from a Venezuelan amerindian (see Methods) is interesting; the reason for the disparity between the fates of the
duplicated cagA genes in the two related strains is also
unclear. The branch lengths on the phylogenetic tree
show similarity to each other, with the exception of the
Vietnamese lineage; this branch shows considerable accelerated evolution.
2Δl was calculated as 73.6 for the branches test, which
was statistically significant. Ka/Ks values of greater than 1
were observed for 5 branches (Figure 1); those leading to
the Venezuela (1.56), Peru1 (1.04) and Peru2 (3.10)
sequences, to the common ancestor of the amerindian
sequences (1.03) and to the lineage leading from the common ancestor of the asian sequences (1.29). These
branches are subject to positive selection, while the amerindian common ancestor is neutral over the length of the
gene.
2Δl was calculated as 161 between the null and alternative models, for the sites test, which was statistically significant. Estimates of parameters were as follows: p0 = 0.51,
p1 = 0.49, ω0 = 0.03, ω1 = 1 (neutral model), p0 = 0.47, p1
= 0.38, p3 = 0.14, ω0 = 0.03, ω1 = 1, ω2 = 3.74 (selection
model). Sites identified as being under positive selection,
with statistical significance according to the Bayes Empirical Bayes test [39], were: 101, 206, 306, 378, 532, 542, 548,
604, 651, 774, 793, 815, 831, 834, 869, 876, 886, 892, 901,
998, 1004. The numbering was based on the Peru1
sequence.
A branches-sites test was conducted on each branch of
the tree. Those lineages found to display positive selection are listed in Table 2. These included the lineages
previously identified by the branches test, and additionally the african, Italian, Swedish and Vietnamese lineages.
The results showing positive selection in cagA isolated
from various populations are consistent with a McDonald-Kreitman test that shows that partial cagA
sequences isolated from the Mexican population are
under positive selection [44]. Parallel evolution in residues or different regions of the cagA proteins is not
observed, although residues in the 900 amino acid region
are under stronger diversifying selection, when the Venezuelan and Peru2 genes are examined in a sliding window
analysis (Figure 3). This is an interesting result as this
region of the cagA gene encodes the EPIYA repeats,
which have a role in modulating the carcinogenicity of
the cagA gene. Thus, it would appear that the effects of
diversifying selection may have a direct role in modulating carcinogenesis.
Population specific differences in positive selection

Positive selection on cagA is likely to be due to avoidance
of the adaptive immune response, IgG, or to enhance
binding to cellular receptors which are antagonistically

co-evolving. There is a strong immune response against
the cagA protein (cagA is immunodominant); this may
have led to an ‘arms race’ between host and bacteria, and
hence the signature of positive selection. This is often the
case with extracellular proteins of pathogens, either
located on the cell surface or secreted. There is a precedent in bacteria, with the porB porin gene of Neisseria
gonorrhoeae and meningitidis [45], and a variety of extracellular proteins from Escherichia coli [46]. Secreted slr
proteins from H.pylori also show signatures of positive
selection [47]. This scenario would imply that the regions
of cagA under positive selection are immunogenic.

H.pylori cagA from a range of populations around the
world show evidence of positive selection (using the
branches-sites test); these include sequences from Venezuela, Vietnam, Sweden, Peru, Africa and Italy. However,
as human and H.pylori strains have co-evolved, cagA
genes from some strains have undergone stronger positive selection, particularly the strains with ancestry in the
human groups that most recently migrated, the asians
and the amerindians [48,49]. The cause of the differences
in strength of selection on the cagA genes presumably
lies in genetic differences at the host level, but is also
potentially mediated by different responses induced by

the cagA protein, resulting from functional differences
between different cagA proteins. The intra-population
genetic distances are smaller in human groups as they
migrated east out from Africa [50]. Host-specific differences may include differences in the immune response,
or differences in the activities of cellular cagA binding
proteins. Codon usage analysis (Table 3) indicates that
the codon adaptation index is similar for different cagA
genes, suggesting that there are no strong differences in
translational selection between cagA genes from different
H.pylori strains, which may indicate no major functional
differences between genes or simply reflect the lack of
translational selection on highly expressed genes

genome-wide [51]. This data helps to inform the sliding
window analysis; translational selection has been shown
to result in false indications of positive selection [52]: this
is not likely to be the case here due to the lack of translational selection on these genes.
Polymorphisms in the IL-1 gene cluster modify gastric
cancer risk [53]. The induction of IL-8 secretion by the
cag PaI is a major stimulus of the immune response [49].
Thus, differences in host interleukin genotypes may lead
to differences in outcome for disease progression and differences in selective pressure on the cagA genes in different populations. Amerindians underwent a population
bottleneck during the migration of their ancestors from

involved in avoidance of the immune system by H.pylori.
However, cagA+ strains elicit a strengthened immune
response and increased inflammation [56-58]. Inflammation may be a mechanism to obtain nutrients [59], however if cagA is evolving to avoid the immune system
while at the same time stimulating it, then this seems
contradictory.

of the O blood group amongst amerindians [54], this
may have led to a homogeneity of immune response.
This may have affected the strains capacity to bind non
O human blood antigens; most H.pylori strains are able
to bind the A,B and O antigens via the babA adhesin,
while amerindian strains from South America bind best
to O antigens [55]. It is interesting to note that the east
asian population is also relatively genetically homogenous
[49].

Distribution of gastric cancer worldwide and its
relationship with the strength of positive selection on
cagA

There are great variations in the incidence of gastric cancer worldwide, with parts of East Asia and Latin America
showing high incidences, while other parts of the world
such as Africa and parts of Europe showing low incidences
(Table 4). The incidence rates do not correlate with rates
of infection with H.pylori. For instance, there are high
rates of H.pylori associated pathogenicity in Japan, Korea
and parts of China, but low in Thailand and Indonesia
even though they have high infection rates; this is the
‘Asian paradox’ [60]. Instead, incidence appears to be
linked to the frequency and genotype of cagA [61], while
other factors are also likely to play a role such as altitude,
diet and host genotype. In addition, recent work shows
that recent migrations and population movements have
resulted in the introduction of ‘non-native’ H.pylori strains
with different cagA alleles into established human populations [42,62], this gives an added level of complexity.
Given that amerindian and the ancestral asian cagA
sequences show stronger signs of positive selection, and
that asian and latin american populations can exhibit
high incidences of gastric cancer, this might imply a link
between the strength of positive selection on the cagA

gene and the oncogenicity of the gene. The results of the
sliding window analysis, where the cagA region containing the EPIYA domains is under positive selection, are
consistent with this hypothesis. Further work is required.
If verified, this form of sequence analysis may help identify at risk populations.
Evolutionary benefit of cagA to H.pylori

The signature of positive selection observed on the cagA
gene indicates that the cagA protein is undergoing adaptive evolution in some strains, and is beneficial to the
bacteria. Differences in rates of adaptation imply host
specific differences. The benefit to the bacteria is
mediated via the role of cagA within the pathogenicity
island; the specific role of cagA, and that of the PaI,
remain to be determined. In general, PaIs have a role in
promoting survival of bacterial pathogens [63]. The positive selection observed on the cagA oncogene is unusual
as it is the first case observed of positive selection on an
oncogene in a vertically transmitted pathogen. Positive
selection is a feature of antagonistic coevolution, which
implies harmful effects on the host, but also mutualistic
coevolution, which implies benefits. Positive selection has
been observed on the Epstein Barr Virus - encoded oncogene LMP1 [64] and the human papillomavirus type 16
oncogene [65,66], however these are horizontally transmitted pathogens where a balance is expected between
virulence and transmissibility [67]. This may imply that
H.pylori has been horizontally transmitted to a greater
extent than previously recognized.
Virulence is a result of enhanced reproduction of a
pathogen. Early models proposed that a parasite would be
inclined to evolve reduced virulence, given that mortality
of host is a disadvantage. However, this view has been criticized as relying on group selection [68]. However, vertically inherited pathogens are expected to become less
pathogenic over time; if the pathogen depends on the host
for transmission and the transmission is highly efficient
then it is not in the interests of the pathogen to significantly reduce the fitness of the host [69]. H.pylori displays
two features, in addition to the positive selection observed
on cagA, that appear to contradict this paradigm. Firstly,
the acquisition of the cag PaI during speciation from
related non-pathogenic gut helicobacters (Figure 4a), indicates that H.pylori underwent an initial increase in pathogenicity. Second, the evolution of the more pathogenic
EPIYA-D motifs in the cagA gene in some asian strains
(Figure 4b), indicates that some cagA+ H.pylori has undergone a more recent additional increase in pathogenicity.
To some extent, this contradiction could be explained by
the proposal that there is actually a host - beneficial component to cagA, or that it has not exerted a sufficiently
deleterious effect on the host. One question that requires
answering is whether those strains that are undergoing a

Page 7 of 10

greater degree of positive selection are becoming more
pathogenic.
In addition, potential beneficial effects of cagA at the
population level via elimination of the elderly has been
suggested [13] (this explanation relies on the theory of
inclusive fitness [70]). This essentially views cagA as a
gene that enhances intrinsic mortality in old individuals,
however it is unclear whether intrinsic mortality in a subgroup of the population has ever been selected for. While
H.pylori has largely been considered a pathogen, there is
increasing evidence of its positive benefits to human
health. For instance, H.pylori has a beneficial role in preventing esophageal cancer, by reducing acid reflux [71,72],
however in the past this has been unlikely to have provided much evolutionary benefit to the human population
given that over 90% of patients are over 55 [73], while
before the 20 th century the average life expectancy of
human populations was less than 40. The strongest inverse
correlation between esophageal cancer occurrence and
infection with H.pylori is in East Asia, attributed to the
highly interactive (eastern) form of cagA, which causes
pan- and corpus- predominant gastritis and reduces acid
production [13]. There is also an inverse relationship
between H.pylori and asthma and allergies [74-76], obesity
[77] and infant diarrhea [78]. Asthma and obesity are
modern illnesses, so are unlikely to have played a role in
the evolutionary dynamics of the bacteria.
Ulcers are a modern disease [79], while gastric cancer
has been recorded since ancient times. However, it is
most prevalent in 55 year olds and over, this indicates
that historically it is unlikely to have exerted a strong
selective pressure, given that before the 20th century the
average life expectancy was considerably lower. These
considerations lead to the conclusion that the cagA gene
is either insufficiently deleterious to the human host, that
the cagA protein has a beneficial component to the host,
or that horizontal transmission has been an important
feature of H.pylori in the recent past. There is increasing
evidence that in developing countries, horizontal transmission of H.pylori occurs due to poor sanitary conditions [80,81]. If there is (or has been) significant
horizontal transmission, then there may be population
specific differences in the amount of horizontal transmission which may have led to differences in selective pressures on the pathogen.
H.pylori has been utilized as a model for infective carcinogenesis, and is a model of pathogen evolution. The
results of this work suggest that the cagA gene is insufficiently deleterious to the human host, that the cagA
protein has a benefit to the host or that horizontal
inheritance has affected the evolutionary dynamics of
the bacteria more than recognized. The results reported
here offer an insight into important aspects of microbehost coevolution.
