Abstract
Background: Thermus thermophilus and Deinococcus radiodurans belong to a distinct bacterial clade but have
remarkably different phenotypes. T. thermophilus is a thermophile, which is relatively sensitive to ionizing radiation
and desiccation, whereas D. radiodurans is a mesophile, which is highly radiation- and desiccation-resistant. Here
we present an in-depth comparison of the genomes of these two related but differently adapted bacteria.
Results: By reconstructing the evolution of Thermus and Deinococcus after the divergence from their common
ancestor, we demonstrate a high level of post-divergence gene flux in both lineages. Various aspects of the
adaptation to high temperature in Thermus can be attributed to horizontal gene transfer from archaea and
thermophilic bacteria; many of the horizontally transferred genes are located on the single megaplasmid of
Thermus. In addition, the Thermus lineage has lost a set of genes that are still present in Deinococcus and many other
mesophilic bacteria but are not common among thermophiles. By contrast, Deinococcus seems to have acquired
numerous genes related to stress response systems from various bacteria. A comparison of the distribution of
orthologous genes among the four partitions of the Deinococcus genome and the two partitions of the Thermus
genome reveals homology between the Thermus megaplasmid (pTT27) and Deinococcus megaplasmid (DR177).
Conclusion: After the radiation from their common ancestor, the Thermus and Deinococcus lineages have taken
divergent paths toward their distinct lifestyles. In addition to extensive gene loss, Thermus seems to have acquired
numerous genes from thermophiles, which likely was the decisive contribution to its thermophilic adaptation. By
contrast, Deinococcus lost few genes but seems to have acquired many bacterial genes that apparently enhanced
its ability to survive different kinds of environmental stresses. Notwithstanding the accumulation of horizontally
transferred genes, we also show that the single megaplasmid of Thermus and the DR177 megaplasmid of
Deinococcus are homologous and probably were inherited from the common ancestor of these bacteria.

Deinococcus spp. and Thermus spp. are believed to belong to
a distinct branch of bacteria called the Deinococcus-Thermus group [1]. The common origin of these bacteria is
supported by the fact that they consistently form a
strongly supported clade in phylogenetic trees of ribosomal RNAs and several conserved proteins including
ribosomal proteins, RNA polymerase subunits, RecA, and
others [1-7]. The Thermus genus currently consists of 14
thermophilic species, whereas the Deinococcus genus
includes at least eleven, mostly mesophilic species known
for their extreme resistance to γ-irradiation and other
agents causing DNA damage, particularly, desiccation
[7,8]. Interestingly, two new species, D. frigens sp. nov., D.
saxicola, have been isolated recently from Antarctic rock
and soil samples [9]. D. geothermalis and D. murrayi, are
considered to be thermophilic (topt~45–50°C) [10].
T. thermophilus (TT) (strain HB27, ATCC BAA-163)and D.
radiodurans (DR) (strain R1, ATCC BAA-816) have similar
general physiology, both being catalase-positive, red-pigmented, non-sporulating, aerobic chemoorganoheterotrophs [11]. However, the two organisms are dramatically
different in terms of stress resistance: DR is one of the
most resistant to radiation and desiccation among the
characterized organisms and, generally, can survive
diverse types of oxidative stress, whereas TT is a thermophile that thrives under thermal stress conditions but
is relatively sensitive to radiation and other forms of oxidative stress. Recently, the genomes of T. thermophilus
HB27 and HB8 [12,13] became available for comparison
with the previously sequenced genome of D. raduodurans
R1 [14].
Despite extensive research, genetic systems underlying
both thermophilic adaptations and radiation resistance
remain poorly understood. Attempts have been made to
detect "thermophilic determinants" in the proteomes of
thermophiles using a comparative-genomic approach.
This resulted in the delineation of a set of proteins that
might be associated with the thermophilic phenotype,
although most of these are significantly enriched in thermophiles but not unique to these organisms [15-17].
Other distinctions between thermophilic and mesophilic
proteins might be due to differences in their structural
properties, such as different amino acid compositions,
loop lengths, number of salt bridges, strength of hydrophobic interaction, number of disulfide bonds, and other
features [18-25].
Various hypotheses also have been proposed to explain
radiation resistance, some postulating the existence of
specialized genetic systems, particularly those for DNA
repair and stress response [7,26]. Recently, however, alternative possibilities have been advanced. For example, the

post-irradiation adjustment of metabolism of D. radiodurans might prevent production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by decreasing the number of reactions
involving oxygen [27,28], and high intracellular manganese concentrations of Deinococcus spp. might help scavenge ROS generated during irradiation and postirradiation recovery [28,29]. However, these explanations
of radiation resistance have received little direct support
from comparative-genomic analyses [7,27,28].
Several evolutionary processes could potentially contribute to the genome differentiation of TT and DR subsequent to the divergence from the common ancestor: (i)
differential gene loss and gain, (ii) acquisition of genes via
horizontal gene transfer (HGT) which may be followed by
loss of the ancestral orthologous gene (xenologous gene
displacement (XGD)), (iii) lineage-specific expansion of
paralogous gene families by duplication and/or acquisition of paralogs via HGT; (IV) modification of amino acid
composition that could affect protein stability. Here, we
experimentally characterize radiation and desiccation
resistance of TT in comparison to DR, and, assess the contribution of different evolutionary processes to distinct
adaptations of TT and DR, using a variety of comparativegenomic approaches and phylogenetic analysis. We identify the unique feature of the gene repertoires of TT and
DR that might contribute to these phenotypic differences,
which could be the subject of further experimental work.
In addition, we describe the results of a detailed analysis
of the proteins predicted to be involved in DNA repair and
stress response functions, which are particularly relevant
for adaptive evolution of resistance phenotypes.

Results and discussion
Experimental characterization of resistance to gammaradiation and desiccation, and determination of
intracellular Mn/Fe ratio for T. thermophilus
While the radiation- and desiccation-resistant phenotypes
of DR and the thermal requirements of both TT and DR
have been studied extensively ([7,12,30] and references
therein), we are unaware of any detailed characterization
of the response of TT to irradiation or desiccation. Therefore, we sought to investigate these properties in order to
obtain a more complete picture of the differences in the
stress response phenotypes of TT and DR. Not unexpectedly, we found that TT was much more sensitive to acute
irradiation than DR. The survival curve of TT is similar to
that of Esherichia coli K12. For DR, the radiation dose
yielding 10% colony forming unit (CFU) survival (D10) is
~16 kGy, whereas for TT and E. coli, the D10 dose is ~0.8
kGy and ~0.7 kGy, respectively (Figure 1). TT is also
highly sensitive to desiccation. The 10% CFU desiccation
survival frequency of DR is sustained after 30 days, while
TT reaches the 10% CFU desiccation survival at ~10 hours
(0.4% survival after 24 hours) and, by the 5th day, suffers
essentially 100% lethality. The low resistance of TT to desiccation is observed regardless of the temperature and drying rate (see Additional file 1, "Desiccation of TT at
65°C"). The desiccation resistance of E. coli was found to
be intermediate between those of TT and DR (Figure 2).

We recently reported a trend of intracellular Mn/Fe concentration ratios in bacterial IR resistance, where very high
and very low Mn/Fe ratios correlated with very high and
very low resistances, respectively [29]. We have also
shown that growing D. radiodurans in conditions which
limited Mn(II) accumulation, significantly lowered the
cells' IR resistance [29]. These observations led to the
hypothesis that the ratio of Mn to Fe in a cell might determine the relative abundance of different ROS induced
during exposure to and recovery from IR [28,29]. At high
concentrations, Mn(II) can act as true catalyst of the dismutation of superoxide (O2•-), with Mn cycling between
the divalent and trivalent states; Mn redox-cycling scavenges both O2•- and hydrogen peroxide [31]. In this context, we determined the intracellular Mn/Fe ratio of TT
using an inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry
method (ICP-MS), as previously described [29]. TT cells
contained 0.211 (± 0.0254) nmol Mn/mg protein and
4.54 (± 0.778) nmol Fe/mg protein. The intracellular Mn/
Fe ratio of TT (D10, ~0.8 kGy) is 0.047 compared to
0.0072 for E. coli (D10, ~0.7 kGy), 0.24 for D. radiodurans
(D10, ~16 kGy), and <0.0001 for Pseudomonas putida (D10,
~0.25 kGy) [29]. Thus, TT appears to be somewhat more
sensitive to acute IR and desiccation than predicted by its
Mn/Fe ratio, suggesting the possibility of more complex
relationships between these two variables. Notably, scavenging of O2•- by Mn(II) is highly dependent on the availability of H2O2, which in TT would be expected to become
limiting during recovery at 65°C because of thermal
decomposition [32]; inefficient Mn redox-cycling can lead
to Mn(III) accumulation, which is cytotoxic. Both DR and
TT encode an ABC- type Mn transporter and a transcriptional regulator that probably regulates Mn homeostasis.
Additionally, DR has a NRAMP family Mn transporter, for
which there is no ortholog in TT.
Reconstruction of the gene-content tree and the gene
repertoire of the common ancestor of Deinococcus and
Thermus
Information on the presence-absence of orthologous
genes in a set of genomes can be used to produce a genecontent tree [33,34]. The topology of a gene-content tree
may reflect not only the phylogenetic relationships
between the compared species but lifestyle similarities
and differences as well [33,35,36]. Given the dramatic differences in the lifestyles and resistance phenotypes of TT
and DR, we were interested to determine whether or not
the gene content of TT was most similar to that of DR or
those of other thermophilic bacteria or, perhaps, even
archaea. To this end, we assigned the proteins encoded in
the TT genome to the Clusters of Orthologous Groups of
proteins (COGs) [37] and, using the patterns of
representation of species in COGs to calculate distances
between species, reconstructed a gene-content tree as
described previously [35]. In the resulting gene-content

tree, which included 62 sequenced genomes of prokaryotes and unicellular eukaryotes, TT and DR were confidently recovered as sister species, and the DR-TT lineage
was positioned within a subtree that also included Actinobacteria and Cyanobacteria, several of which are known
for their extreme radiation and desiccation resistances
[38-40] (Figure 3). For this branch, the topology of the
gene-content tree mimics the topologies of trees constructed with other approaches based on genome-wide
data [34,35], indicating that the gene repertoires of these
bacteria, and TT and DR in particular, have been diverging, roughly, in a clock-like fashion. To determine which
genes were likely to have been lost and gained in each lineage, we reconstructed a parsimonious scenario of evolution from the last bacterial common ancestor (LBCA) to
TT and DR, through their last common ancestor. The
reconstruction was performed on the basis of the assignment of TT and DR proteins to COGs, together with COGbased phyletic patterns of 62 other sequenced bacterial
and archaeal genomes [37], using a previously developed
weighted parsimony method [41] (see Methods and Additional file 2). This approach assigns 1,310 genes (COGs)
to the DR-TT common ancestor (Figure 4). Of these, 1,081
(~80%) were retained in both TT and DR and belong to
their shared gene core. Since TT (2210 genes) has far fewer
predicted protein-coding genes than DR (3191 genes), it
seems likely that the divergence of the two involved substantial genome reduction in TT and/or genome expan-

sion in DR. However, the reconstruction results suggest
that TT has not experienced massive genome reduction
although the total gene flux (i.e., the sum total of genes
inferred to have been lost and gained) during the evolution of this lineage was considerable, involving ~25% of
the gene complement. In contrast, DR gained 272 COGs,
with only 59 lost, which indicates substantial genome
growth after the DR-TT divergence (Figure 4).
We were further interested in determining whether similarities existed among the gene repertoires of TT and two
deeply-branching bacterial hyperthermophiles, Aquifex
aeolicus (AA) and Thermotoga maritima (TM). We found
that genes that are present in TT but not DR are significantly more likely to be present in AA and TM than genes
present in DR but not TT (Table 1). In contrast, among the
170 TT genes inferred to have been lost, only 20 were
present in both AA and TM. Thus, the gene repertoire of TT
has significantly greater similarity with hyperthermophilic bacteria than the gene repertoire of DR, perhaps
resulting from direct or parallel HGT (see also below).
The majority of the genes shared by TT and DR encode
house-keeping proteins and are widespread in bacteria.
Among those, 14 COGs are unusual in that they are not
found in any other bacteria but instead are shared by TT
and DR with archaea or eukaryotes. This set includes 8
subunits of the Archaeal/vacuolar-type H+-ATPase and six
other COGs that consist of characteristic archaeal genes
(phosphoglycerate mutase, COG3635; 2-phosphoglycerate kinase, COG2074; SAR1-like GTPase, COG1100;
GTP:adenosylcobinamide-phosphate guanylyltransferase,
COG2266; Predicted membrane protein, COG3374 ; Predicted DNA modification methylase, COG1041).
As noticed previously, some DR genes that belong to families well-represented in both bacteria and archaea
showed clear archaeal affinity [42]. To assess how many
genes of apparent "thermophilic" descent (either archaeal
or bacterial) might already have been present already in
the common DR-TT ancestor, we performed phylogenetic
analysis of genes that were assigned to the DR-TT ancestor

and had 3 of the 5 best hits to the genes from thermophiles (both archaeal and bacterial; see Additional file
1: "Phylogenetic analysis of the genes of the reconstructed
DR-TT common ancestor"). We found that at least 122
genes (~10% of the predicted gene repertoire of the DR-TT
common ancestor) of the originally selected 205 genes
showed an affinity to thermophilic species, i.e., either a
branch of two orthologous genes from DR and TT, or a DR
or TT gene (in cases when the respective ortholog apparently was lost in the other lineage) clustered with thermophiles (see Additional file 1, table 1S; and Additional
file 6). Due to the fact that many tree topologies are highly
perturbed by multiple HGT events and may be inaccurate
due to differences in evolutionary rates between lineages,
this is only a rough estimate of the number of "thermophilic" genes in the DR-TT ancestor. In particular, it
cannot be ruled out that some of the ancestral "thermophilic" genes, which are currently present in TT but not
DR (10 such genes out of 122 tested genes), have been
acquired by TT via XGD (see Additional file 1, table 1S).
Taken together, these observations suggest the possibility
of ecological contacts between the DR-TT ancestor and
hyperthermophilic archaea and/or bacteria, leading to
substantial acquisition of "thermophilic" genes via HGT.
Gene gain and loss in Thermus
Our reconstruction of the evolutionary events that
occurred after the divergence of the TT and DR lineages
from the common ancestor delineated the sets of genes
that likely have been gained and lost by each lineage (Figure 4). We first consider in greater detail the pattern of
gene loss and gain in TT. The absence of certain metabolic
genes in TT creates gaps in its metabolic pathways, some
of which are essential. However, TT is capable of synthesizing all amino acids, nucleotides and a majority of
cofactors, suggesting that the gaps are filled by analogous
or at least non-orthologous enzymes. Several such cases
have been described. For example, TT and DR encode
unrelated thymidylate synthases, DR2630 (COG0207)
and TTC0731 (COG1351). The classical, folate-dependent thymidylate synthase (COG0207) present in DR is
probably ancestral in bacteria and apparently was
displaced via HGT in the Thermus lineage by the flavindependent thymidylate synthase, typical of archaea and
bacterial thermophiles. In other cases, the substituted
analogous enzymes or pathways remain uncharacterized.
For instance, the displacement of the folate-dependent
thymidylate synthase with the flavin-dependent type in
the TT lineage and in other bacteria and archaea correlates
with the apparent loss of dihydrofolate reductase (folA,
COG0262), which catalyzes the last step of the tetrahydrofolate biosynthesis pathway. Since tetrahydrofolate is
an essential cofactor, a displacement appears most likely.
Recently, it has been shown that the halobacterial FolPFolC fusion protein complemented a Haloferax volcanii

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/57

folA mutant [43]. Thus, it appears likely that FolC and
FolP in TT and other organisms complement the activity
of FolA although the existence of an unrelated, as yet
uncharacterized dihydrofolate reductase cannot be ruled
out.
In addition, TT does not encode two enzymes for pyridoxal phosphate biosynthesis (pdxK, COG0259 and
pdxH, COG2240), while DR has a complete set of
enzymes of this pathway. Our reconstructions suggest that
pdxK was likely lost in the TT lineage, whereas DR probably independently acquired pdxH. However, the pathway
is likely to be functional in both organisms. Since similar
gaps in the pyridoxal phosphate biosynthesis are seen in a
variety of prokaryotes [44], it appears that, for at least
some steps of this pathway, there exists a set of distinct
enzymes which remain unidentified.
Some systems apparently were completely lost in the TT
lineage. These include the urease complex, the ramnose
metabolism pathway, acyl CoA:acetate/3-ketoacid CoA
transferase, fructose transport and utilization, and glycerol metabolism. Notably, most of these systems are also
absent in thermophilic bacteria and many thermophilic
archaea.
In contrast to DR, the genes that appear to have been
acquired by TT show a clear connection to the thermophilic lifestyle. In particular, TT seems to have acquired
23 gene families from the set of putative thermophilic
determinants [17], whereas the common DR-TT ancestor
had 5 genes from the list, and DR seems to have acquired
only one (see Additional file 3). The majority of these proteins (17 of 31) are encoded in the TT megaplasmid and
11 belong to the predicted mobile DNA repair system
characteristic of thermophiles [16,45] (Figure 7A; see
details below). In addition, TT has acquired 4 "archaeal"
genes that are not encoded in any of the genomes of mesophilic bacteria assigned to COGs (peptide chain release
factor 1, COG1503; DNA modification methylase,
COG1041; and two membrane proteins, COG3462 and
COG4645).
The Sox-like sulfur oxidation system is among the group
of genes that were apparently acquired in the TT lineage.
The TT Sox operon is partly similar to the one identified
in AA (see Additional file 1, Figure 2S), and might have
been horizontally transferred between the AA and TT lineages with subsequent local rearrangements. The presence
of the Sox operon in TT suggests that this bacterium can
use reduced sulfur compounds as a source of energy and
sulfur. Another system likely acquired by TT is lactose utilization (at least three proteins: LacZ, COG3250; GalK,
COG0153; GalT COG1085; GalA, COG3345). This sys-

A. Organization of genes encoding the putative thermophyle-specific DNA repair system in two Thermus strains and the draft
genome of D. geothermalis. The boxes on top of the figure show COG numbers. Genes are shown by block arrows indicating
the direction of transcription and identified by their systematic names. For each column of the alignment, the corresponding
COG number and predicted function is indicated. D. geothermalis' genes are connected with respective orthologs in both TT
strains by a straight line. Generally, orthologous genes are shown by the same color and pattern. The exceptions are the RAMP
proteins of COGs 1336, 1367, 1604, 1337 and 1332, which are all shown in pink. Other, more distant RAMPs are also shown
in pink, with different patterns [16]. Proteins that do not belong to COGs but have homologs in other species are marked by
diamonds.

Gene gain and loss in Deinococcus
The DR lineage has apparently acquired many more genes
than it has lost (Figure 4). The majority of the genes lost

by DR encode enzymes of energy metabolism and biosynthesis of cofactors. One example is the loss of the three
subunits of pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase, which is
one of the several known systems for pyruvate oxidation,
a key reaction of central metabolism. Another example of
gene loss in DR involves the three subunits of NAD/NADP

transhydrogenase, which is responsible for energydependent reduction of NADP+ [46]. In addition, the DR
lineage lost four enzymes of NAD biosynthesis and six
enzymes of cobalamine biosynthesis, and consistently,
DR is dependent on an exogenous source of NAD for
growth [28,47].
A conspicuous number of genes apparently acquired by
the DR lineage encode systems of protein degradation and
amino acid catabolism (e.g., urease, DRA0311-DRA0319,
and a predicted urea transporter, DRA0320-DRA0324;
histidine degradation system, DRA0147-DRA0150;
monoamine oxidase, DRA0274; lysine 2,3-aminomutase,
DRA0027; kynureninase and tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase, DRA0338-DRA0339; peptidase E, DR1070, and
carboxypeptidase C, DR0964; and D-aminopeptidase,
DR1843 (see Additional file 4). A similar trend is
observed for the expansion of several protein families in
DR, such as secreted subtilisin-like proteases (see below).
Additionally, DR acquired two three-subunit complexes
of aerobic-type carbon monoxide dehydrogenase
(DRA0231-DRA0233 and DRA0235-DRA0237); oxidation of CO by this enzyme might be used as an energy
source as shown for some bacteria [48]. Acquisition and
expansion of these metabolic systems, together with the
loss of certain biosynthetic capabilities, supports the possibility that metabolic restructuring could impact
oxidative stress resistance in DR by decreasing the need for
high-energy-dependent cellular activities. Energy production through the respiratory chain is one major source of
free radicals in the cell [49].
DR has many more genes for proteins involved in inorganic ion transport and metabolism than TT. In particular,
DR has acquired the multisubunit Na+/H+ antiporter (7
genes), K+-transporting ATPase (3 genes), and the FeoA/
FeoB Fe transport system. This abundance of ion transport
systems might be indirectly linked to oxidative stress
resistance through regulation of membrane ion gradients
and Mn/Fe homeostasis (see above).
DR is more dependent than TT on peptide-derived growth
substrates [47] and has a more complex stress response
circuitry. Consistent with this, the signal transduction systems of DR, as predicted by genome analysis, are considerably more elaborate than those of TT. In particular, DR
has at least 33 COGs (15 probably acquired after the
divergence from the common ancestor with TT) related to
signal-transduction functions that are not represented in
TT as compared to 12 (5 acquired) such COGs in TT. Furthermore, although most of the signal-transduction
domains are shared by DR and TT, the domain architectures of the respective multidomain proteins are completely different ([7] and KSM, unpublished
observations).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/57

Among the genes apparently acquired by DR, two encode
multidomain proteins containing distinct periplasmic ligand-binding sensor domains (DRA0202, COG5278 and
DR1174, COG3614). Another protein, DRA0204, contains the CHASE3 domain [50] and is located in a predicted operon with superoxide dismutase (DRA0202),
indicating a function in oxidative stress response. The protein DR0724 contains the SARP domain which is involved
in apoptosis-related signaling pathways in eukaryotes
[51] but its function in bacteria is unknown. The roles of
the other signal transduction proteins of DR are even less
clear, with the notable exception of a phytochrome-like
protein (DRA0050) that apparently was acquired by DR
from a bacterial source and has been implicated in UV
resistance [52].
Additionally, DR has many genes (25 COGs) encoding
systems for microbial defense; TT has only 14 COGs in
this category, 13 of which are shared with DR. At least 7
genes for restriction-modification system subunits were
specifically acquired by the DR lineage, along with several
antibiotic-resistance enzymes. This difference might be
linked to the reduced metabolic capabilities of DR, which
is dependent on nutrient-rich conditions for growth and,
perhaps, encounters more microbial species than TT.
The previous analysis of the DR genome revealed 15 genes
that appear to have been horizontally transferred from
unexpected sources, such as eukaryotes and viruses [7];
only two of these 15 genes are present in TT, the desiccation-related protein of the ferritin family and the Uma2like family proteins (see discussion of these proteins
below). Two desiccation-related proteins have been
shown to be involved in desiccation but not radiation
resistance [53]; Ro ribonucleoprotein is apparently
involved in UV resistance [54], and topoisomerase IB,
while active, has no known role in DR [55]. So far, none
of these genes has been linked experimentally with radioresistance in DR.
Identification of xenologous gene displacement by
phylogenetic analysis
It is well-established that HGT has made major contributions to the gene repertoires of most thermophilic bacteria
as supported by the presence of numerous genes with
unexpectedly high similarity to and/or phylogenetic affinity with genes typical of hyperthermophilic archaea [5660]. These cases include even those proteins that have
orthologs in mesophilic bacteria but, as shown by phylogenetic analysis, have clear affinity to archaea or thermophilic bacteria from distant bacterial lineages, which is
indicative of XGD [57]. To investigate the impact of HGT
from thermophiles leading to XGD on the evolution of
the gene repertoire of TT, we determined the taxonomic
affiliations of the proteins from the common gene core of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/57

TT and DR. We used the taxonomic distribution of best
hits in BLAST searches for preliminary identification of
HGT candidates, followed by a detailed phylogenetic
analysis of selected genes.

bacteria in the DR lineage. More generally, these results
emphasize that the taxonomic distribution of best database hits can be taken only as a rough and preliminary
indicator of HGT.

As expected, compared to DR, TT has a notable excess in
the fraction of best hits to thermophilic bacteria and
archaea for both core and non-core proteins (Figure 5A;
and see Additional file 5). However, it has been reported
that the best BLAST hit does not always accurately reflect
phylogeny [61]. In particular, artifacts of best hit analysis
may be caused by similar biases in the amino acid composition of proteins in TT and other thermophiles, as
demonstrated previously [62,63]. To assess these effects
systematically, we performed phylogenetic analysis of 112
TT proteins and 21 DR proteins from the common core
that had their respective best hits in thermophiles (see
Additional file 7). Despite the fact that all these trees were
built for families in which TT and DR proteins were not
mutual best hits in the non-redundant protein sequence
database (National Center for Biotechnology Information, NIH, Bethesda), more than half of the trees (69 trees,
52%) recovered a DR-TT clade, 39 of these grouping this
clade with mesophiles and 30 with thermophiles (Figure
5B). Nevertheless, the difference of evolutionary patterns
of DR and TT came across clearly in this analysis: a reliable
affinity with thermophiles was detected for 18 TT proteins
and only one DR protein. The former cases are likely to
represent HGT into the TT lineage from other thermophiles, whereas the only "thermophilic" gene of DR
may involve the reverse direction of HGT, from the DR
lineage to Thermoanaerobacter tencongiensis (data not
shown).

Among the cases of potential XGD supported by phylogenetic analysis, there are two ribosomal proteins, L30 and
L15, which are encoded by adjacent genes within a conserved ribosomal operon. The proteins encoded by surrounding genes in these operons showed clear affinity to
the corresponding DR orthologs (data not shown). In
phylogenetic trees of L30 and L15, the TT proteins reliably
clustered
with
orthologs
from
bacterial
hyperthermophiles and not with the corresponding DR
orthologs (Figure 6A and 6B). The congruent evolutionary
patterns seen with these two ribosomal proteins encoded
by adjacent genes suggest that this gene pair has been
replaced via XGD in situ, without disruption of the operon
organization [65]. Additional cases of apparent XGD,
where DR confidently partitions into the mesophilic
clade, whereas TT belongs to the thermophilic clade, are
shown in Figure 6C, D (in each of these cases, the
thermophilic clade has an admixture of mesophilic species whereas the mesophilic clade includes no
thermophiles).

Amino acid composition bias is known to affect not only
sequence similarity searches but phylogeny reconstruction as well [64]. We tested this effect on our data set by
comparing the sequence-based maximum likelihood trees
to the neighbor-joining trees reconstructed from the
amino acid frequencies of corresponding proteins (see
Additional file 1, "Influence of amino acid composition
on phylogenetic reconstructions"). We found that, in the
majority of cases (>80%), the topology of the sequencebased tree was not congruent with that of the amino acid
composition tree; thus, the effect of the amino acid composition on the breakdown shown in Figure 5B is unlikely
to be substantial. Taken together, these results suggest that
XGD involving genes from thermophiles made a measurable contribution to the evolution of the core gene set of
TT after the divergence from the common DR-TT ancestor;
no such contribution was detected in the case of DR.
While this interpretation seems most plausible given the
ecological proximity of TT and other thermophiles, it cannot be ruled out that the observed patterns (Figure 5B) are
partially explained by XGD with genes from mesophilic

The apparent lineage-specific HGT in DR and TT was not
limited to XGD or to acquisition of genes from thermophiles. Additional examples of various types of HGT
supported by phylogenetic analysis are given in Table 2.
Expanded families of paralogs
Most bacterial lineages contain unique sets of expanded
paralogous gene families [66]. This notion was borne out
by the present comparative-genomic analysis of DR and
TT. None of the expanded families that have been
detected during the previous detailed analysis of the DR
genome [7] was expanded in TT, and many were missing
altogether. This strongly suggests that extensive gene
duplication and acquisition of new pseudoparalogs via
HGT, which led to the expansion of these families in DR,
occurred after the divergence from the common ancestor
with TT, and could contribute to the specific adaptations
of DR (Table 3). Expansion of several other families in DR
was revealed in the course of the present comparison with
TT. One notable example is the family of predicted membrane-associated proteins (DR2080, DR1043, DR1952,
DR1953, DR1738), which are encoded adjacent to transcriptional regulators of the PadR-like family (COG1695;
9 paralogs in DR, none in TT) (Table 3). PadR-like regulators are involved in the regulation of the cellular response
to chemical stress agents, derivatives of phenolic acid [67].
Another previously unnoticed paralogous family that is
expanded in DR includes proteins containing the MOSC
(MOCO sulfurase C-terminal) domain (COG2258, four

paralogs in DR and one in TT). These proteins have been
predicted to function as sulfur-carriers that deliver sulfur
for the formation of sulfur-metal clusters associated with
various enzymes [68]. One of these genes (DR0273)
forms a predicted operon with genes for a Nudix hydrolase and a monooxygenase, suggesting that these proteins
might comprise a distinct stress response/house-cleaning
complex.
Several paralogous families are specifically expanded in
TT (Table 4). The largest of these (15 paralogs compared
to three in DR) is the Uma2 family that is highly expanded
in cyanobacteria but otherwise seen in only a few bacteria.
The function(s) of these proteins is unknown; the presence of conserved acidic residues suggests that they might
be uncharacterized DNA-binding proteins [69]. The
expansion of predicted sugar transporters in TT and the
paucity of extracellular proteases (including subtilases) is

unexpected because it has been shown that TT is predominantly a proteolytic rather than a saccharolytic organism
[70]. However, it should be noted that TT, unlike DR, has
not been observed to secrete proteases (data not shown).
Notably, several protein families that are expanded in TT
but are absent in DR belong to the set of potential
thermophilic determinants (HEPN nucleotide-binding
domain; predicted phosphoesterases related to the Icc
protein) [17] or are expanded in thermophylic archaea
(PIN-like nuclease domain, minimal nucleotidyl transferases, UspA-like nucleotide-binding domain) [71],

differences were observed among the proteins associated
with direct damage reversal (11 in TT versus 26 in DR),
which is due to the extraordinary expansion of the NUDIX
(MutT-like) family of hydrolases in DR [7]. It should be
noted that the majority of these proteins have other substrates than 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine-triphosphate (or
diphosphate), which is cleaved by MutT. Consistently, the

apparent loss of the SOS-response transcriptional repressor LexA [12] and another SOS-response protein, endonuclease VII (XseAB) in the TT lineage; these proteins seem
to have been lost also by another thermophilic bacterium,
AA. In contrast, DR has two LexA paralogs (DRA0344 and
DRA0074), but their functions remain unclear. A genetic
disruption of DRA0344, the paralog that shows greater
similarity to the canonical bacterial LexA protein, does not

result in sensitivity to DNA damage or impairment of
RecA expression [75]. Photolyase (PhrB) and endonuclease IV (nfo) are among the few DNA repair proteins that
probably were acquired by TT after the divergence from
the common ancestor with DR. In addition, the catalytic
subunit of DNA polymerase III of TT (DnaE, TTC1806)
has two inserted inteins, whereas the orthologous
DR0507 has none. In general, it seems that the

conventional DNA-repair systems of TT and DR are
closely related to each other and to the respective systems
of other free-living bacteria. Thus, the unique, shared features of these systems do not explain the very large difference observed in resistance between TT and DR species.
However, a conclusion that there are no important differences between the repair systems of TT and DR might be
premature. Recently, several additional proteins of DR
have been implicated in DNA or RNA repair, either in
direct experiments or on the basis of up-regulation following irradiation, complemented with protein sequence
analysis. These putative repair enzymes include DRB0094,
an RNA ligase [76] that is strongly up-regulated in
response to irradiation [27] and might be involved in an
uncharacterized RNA repair process; a predicted doublestrand break repair complex specific for recovery after irradiation, which consists of DRB0100, a DNA ligase,
DRB0098, a protein containing an HD family phosphatase and polynucleotide kinase domains [7];
DRB0099, a predicted phosphatase of the H2Macro
superfamily ([27] and KSM, unpublished observations); a
double-stranded DNA-binding protein PprA (DRA0346),
which stimulates the DNA end-joining reaction in vitro
[77]; a predicted DNA single-strand annealing protein
DdrA (DR0423) [78]; a regulator of radiation response
IrrE (DR0167); a metal-dependent protease fused to a
helix-turn-helix domain [79,80]; and the uncharacterized
protein DR0070 that has been shown to be essential for
full resistance to acute irradiation [27]. Among these
poorly characterized (predicted) repair proteins of DR,
only DdrA has an ortholog in the TT genome. In general,
these putative repair genes are sparsely represented in bacteria, and it appears most unlikely that they were present
in the common ancestor of TT and DR; most likely, these
genes were acquired by the DR lineage via HGT after the
divergence from the common ancestor with TT, and might

have contributed to the evolution of the resistance phenotype. However, functional relevance of these genes to radiation resistance remains to be confirmed because most of
the corresponding knockout mutants showed only relatively small to moderate decreases in radiation resistance
[27,78].
Among the unique (predicted) repair enzymes of TT, the
most conspicuous ones are the components of the
putative thermophile-specific repair system, which are
predominantly encoded on the TT megaplasmid (Figure
7A). The functional features of the proteins encoded in
this system (COG1203, a DNA helicase, often fused to a
predicted HD-superfamily hydrolase; COG1468, a RecBfamily exonuclease; COG1353, predicted polymerase)
suggest that they are involved in an as yet uncharacterized
DNA repair pathway. It has been hypothesized that this
novel gene complex might be functionally analogous to
the bacterial-eukaryotic system of translesion, mutagenic
repair whose central components are DNA polymerases of
the UmuC-DinB-Rad30-Rev1 superfamily, which typically are missing in thermophiles [16].
Comparison of proteins comprising various (predicted)
systems involved in stress response reveals a greater
number and diversity of such proteins in DR, which has
26 COGs with relevant functions that are not represented
in TT compared to 3 such COGs in TT (see Additional file
1, Table 4S). Altogether, there are 147 proteins in DR in
this category and 86 in TT, suggesting that some of them
are additionally expanded in DR (see the section on
"Expanded families").
Enzymatic systems of defense against oxidative stress predicted in TT and DR also show important differences. TT
has one Mn-dependent superoxide dismutase (SodA) [81]
and one Mn-dependent catalase (with no ortholog in
DR), whereas DR encodes three superoxide dismutases
(one of which is the ortholog of the SodA gene of TT) and
three predicted catalases with no TT orthologs [7]. Additionally, DR has a cytochrome C peroxidase (DRA0301)
and a predicted iron-dependent peroxidase (DRA0145),
enzymes that are likely to provide protection against toxic
peroxides [49]. Orthologs of these enzymes are rare
among bacteria, suggesting that the Deinococcus lineage
acquired them via HGT after the divergence of TT and DR
from the common ancestor. Reduction of oxidized
methionine residues in proteins is crucial for survival of
cells under oxidative stress [82,83]. Consistent with this
idea, two peptide methionine sulfoxide reductases
(PMSRs), MsrA (DR1849) and MsrB (DR1378), are
encoded in the DR genome [84,85], whereas none are
present in TT. Interestingly, both PMSRs are also missing
in Aquifex, Thermotoga and most thermophilic archaea,
suggesting at least two possibilities: either this type of oxi-

dative damage is rare at high temperatures or the known
PMSRs are replaced by uncharacterized analogous
enzymes due to the inefficiency of the former at high
temperatures.
Oxidative stress defense mechanisms also might include
control of Mn and Fe partitioning in the cell [29]. Proteins
of the Dps/ferritin family are required for the storage of
iron in a non-reactive state, which prevents iron-catalyzed
formation of hydroxyl radicals, thus protecting the cell
from iron toxicity (Fenton-type chemistry) [86]. Two Dpsrelated proteins are encoded in the DR genome (DR2263,
DRB0092, COG1528), and it has been shown that one of
them (DR2263) protects DNA from both hydroxyl radical
cleavage and from DNase I-mediated cleavage [87]. Some
proteins homologous to DPS can non-specifically bind
DNA and therefore are viewed as DNA-specific protectors
[88]. Like most thermophiles, TT has no proteins of this
family but encodes a ferritin from another family
(TTC1122).
Since desiccation also causes oxidative stress, proteins
involved in desiccation resistance belong to the general
cellular defense category [89]. Desiccation-related proteins from at least two distinct families have been detected
in DR [7]. These desiccation resistance protein families
(Lea 76 family, DR0105 and DR1172; and Lea14 family,
DR1372) are not represented in TT. However, three TT
proteins (TTP0170, TTP0166, TTP0169) are homologs of
another desiccation resistance protein that was originally
characterized in a plant, Craterostigma plantagineum [90];
DR also has two proteins of this family, DRB0118 and
DRA0258. These proteins are distantly related to
COG1633 and belong to the ferritin family of iron storage
proteins (KSM, unpublished). Highly conserved
homologs of these proteins are also present in thermophilic bacteria and archaea. Two desiccation-related
proteins (DR1172 and DRB0118) appear to be essential

for desiccation resistance but not for radiation resistance
in DR [53].
Comparison of the genome partitions of TT and DR
Both TT and DR have multipartite genomes. To examine
possible evolutionary relationships between the genome
partitions of TT and DR, we analyzed the distribution of
symmetrical best hits (putative orthologs) in the single
extra-chromosomal element of TT, the pTT27 megaplasmid, and the three smaller genome partitions of DR
(small chromosome, DR412; megaplasmid, DR177 and
plasmid, CP1; Table 6). The results of this analysis show
that pTT27 has a highly significant excess of orthologs on
DR177, suggesting that these two megaplasmids are
homologous, i.e., probably evolved from a distinct
genome partition of the common DR-TT ancestor. Apparently, however, the genomes of the megaplasmids have
undergone extensive rearrangements since the divergence
from the common ancestor because no conservation of
gene order could be identified (data not shown).

Notably, among the putative thermophilic determinants
of TT, ~50% are encoded on the megaplasmid (18 out of
36). Of these, 11 belong to the putative mobile thermophile-specific DNA repair system [16,45] (Figure 7A).
Additionally, the megaplasmid carries at least four other
genes associated with this system, which have not yet been
assigned to COGs (Figure 7A). Moreover, the TT
megaplasmid also carries a pseudogene for reverse gyrase,
the most conspicuous signature protein of hyperthermophiles [15,17].
Recently, the genome of another strain of TT (HB8) has
been completely sequenced and became available in public databases [13]. A preliminary comparison of the two
TT strains (HB27 and HB8) revealed considerable differences in the gene orders and contents of the megaplasmids (see Additional file 1, Figure 3S). Interestingly, these

Page 16 of 22
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2005, 5:57

differences in gene content are derived mostly from genes
that appear to be associated with the thermophylic
lifestyle. In particular, strain HB8 encodes an intact
reverse gyrase. Thus, it appears most likely that the gene
for reverse gyrase was acquired from a hyperthermophilic
source by the TT lineage and was present in the common
ancestor of HB27 and HB8 but decayed in the former.
Conversely, HB27 encodes a unique, three-domain fusion
protein (DnaQ endonuclease, DinG helicase and RecQ
helicase), whereas HB8 lacks the DinG and RecQ
orthologs (Figure 7B). Furthermore, there are unexpected
differences in the organization of predicted thermophilespecific repair systems between the two strains of TT. Specifically, HB27 contains a "gram-positive version"
(TTP0132-TTP0136), whereas HB8 has a "proteobacterial
version" of these genes (TTHB186-TTHB194) (Figure 7A).
Furthermore, a nearly complete draft genome sequence of
Deinococcus geothermalis (DG) has recently become publicly available [91]. Since DG is closely related to DR but
is moderately thermophilic, we searched for
"thermophilic" genes in DG genome. Using the "thermophilic" protein sequences ([17] and see above) of TT
and DR as queries, we identified orthologs of 5 of the 6
DR proteins from this set (four of these are also present in
both TT strains) and orthologs of 7 of the remaining 23
"thermophilic" proteins of TT (all components of the predicted thermophilic DNA repair system). These 7 proteins
had the respective TT proteins as the best hits, and their
monophyly was supported by phylogenetic analysis (data
not shown), suggesting that these genes were already
present in the genome of the DR-TT common ancestor.
These observations give rise to two hypotheses: (i) the TT
megaplasmid is essential for the survival of the organism
at high temperatures. Consistent with this idea, we
detected an expansion of a two-component toxin-antitoxin system, which consists of a PIN-like nuclease (toxin)
and a MazE family transcriptional regulator (antitoxin)
[69]. Such a system is known to be responsible for the segregational stability of antibiotic resistance plasmids and
other plasmids via selective elimination of cells that have
failed to acquire a plasmid copy [92], and/or exclusion of
competing plasmids [93]; and (ii) the TT megaplasmid is
a dynamic genome compartment and a veritable sink for
horizontally transferred genes, some of which might affect
the thermophilic phenotype of this bacterium. This is
compatible with the considerable differences in gene content observed between the two TT strains.
Specific roles of plasmid-borne genes in recovery from
DNA damage have been proposed previously, including
class Ib ribonucleotide reductase, periplasmic alkaline
phosphatase, and extracellular nuclease, and subsequent
analyses revealed at least five other genes implicated in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/57

this process (two operons, DRB0098-DRB0100,
DRB0094-DRB0084, see above in "Comparison of DNA
repair and stress response systems") [27,76]. There is also
a toxin-antitoxin system operon in the DR177 megaplasmid (DRB0012a and another gene located immediately
upstream of DRB0012a and currently absent from the
genome annotation). Additionally, there are five other
toxin-antitoxin systems encoded on DR412, the smaller
chromosome of DR, which might be related to maintenance of DR177 megaplasmid in DR. The DR412 chromosome appears to have some special features as well.
Numerous genes that apparently have been acquired by
DR via HGT after the divergence from the common ancestor with TT and are implicated in various processes of
amino acid and nucleotide degradation, map to this
genome partition. Thus, the megaplasmids of TT and DR
(and the smaller chromosome of DR, DR412) appear to
have participated in extensive HGT, which might have
been important for the evolution of thermophily and
radioresistance, although the repertoires of the respective
acquired genes are completely different.

Conclusion
TT and DR share a large core of genes and form a clade in
the gene-content tree, which supports the idea that these
bacteria form a distinct clade, as indicated previously by
phylogenetic analysis of rRNA and various proteins, and
that the evolution of their gene complements was,
roughly, clock-like. However, major differences between
the gene repertoires of TT and DR were observed, indicating that both genomes lost numerous ancestral genes and
acquired distinct sets of new genes primarily via HGT. In
addition, numerous lineage-specific expansions of paralogous gene families were identified, particularly, in DR.
Some of the differences in the gene repertoires of TT and
DR can be linked to the distinctive adaptive strategies of
these bacteria. For example, TT appears to have acquired
many genes from (hyper)thermophilic bacteria and
archaea, whereas DR apparently acquired various genes
involved in oxidative stress response and other "housecleaning" functions from diverse bacterial sources.
The gene content of the TT megaplasmid (pTT27) and the
DR megaplasmid (DR177) are sufficiently similar to conclude that they evolved from a common ancestor. To our
knowledge, this is the first evidence of persistence of a
megaplasmid beyond the genus level. However, the TT
megaplasmid also carries many genes whose functions are
implicated in the thermophylic phenotype; in particular,
components of the predicted thermophile-specific repair
system. These megaplasmids are likely to be essential for
the survival of both TT and DR, with their maintenance
controlled by toxin-antitoxin systems. Furthermore, the
substantial differences between the gene repertoires of the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/57

megaplasmids of TT strains HB27 and HB8 indicate that
this genome partition has been highly dynamic, with high
rates of gene loss and HGT events occurring during
evolution.

room temperature or 65°C. At the indicated times, cells
were re-suspended in TGY, and CFU-survival frequencies
were determined by dilution-plating on solid medium
(65°C).

The evolutionary reconstruction based on the parsimony
principle is generally compatible with the idea that the
common ancestor of TT and DR was a mesophilic bacterium, whereas the thermophylic phenotype of TT evolved
gradually via HGT of genes from thermophiles. Conversely, the radiation-desiccation resistance phenotype of
DR might have gradually evolved via HGT of genes from
other mesophiles, particularly, with highly developed oxidative stress response systems. However, it should be
noted that the TT-DR common gene core includes dozens
of genes of apparent archaeal origin or, at least, genes with
thermophilic affiliation. Moreover, the DG genome
encodes a few additional "thermophilic determinants"
that are missing in DR but are unlikely to have been transferred from a thermophilic source independently of TT, as
shown by comparative-genomic and phylogenetic analyses described here. Thus, acquisition of a considerable
number of archaeal genes might have occurred along the
evolutionary branch leading to the common ancestor of
TT and DR. Accordingly, at this stage, we cannot rule out
the possibility that this ancestor was a moderate thermophile rather than a mesophile. Further sequencing of
bacterial genomes of the Thermus-Deinococcus clade
should allow more definitive comparative-genomic analysis to elucidate the nature of the common ancestor of
these bacteria.

Genome analysis
The sets of predicted proteins of TT and DR were searched
against each other for symmetrical and non-symmetrical
hits using PSI-BLAST with expectation (E) value threshold
of 10-5. Taxonomic affiliation was determined by best hits
in non-redundant database of protein sequences at the
National Center of Biotechnology Information (NIH,
Bethesda) using BLASTP program [94] with default expectation value (0.01). Assignments to COGs were performed
using the COGNITOR program [95] and CDD-search
against COG-based profiles [96]. Contradictory assignments were resolved manually. Lineage-specific expansions (LSE) were identified as described previously
[66,97]. The common genomic core was determined as
follows: among genes that were not assigned to any COG,
orthology relationships between TT and DR were determined via symmetrical best hits. Genes belonging to
COGs, shared between TT and DR and having only one
ortholog from each of the two genomes were directly
assigned to the core. For multiple-paralog COGs, symmetrical best hits between GOG members were used to refine
the relationships between TT and DR proteins. Members
of the corresponding lineage-specific expansions were
added to SymBeT pairs to form many-to-many core clusters. LBCA gene set was determined using an empirical
parsimony procedure based on COG phyletic patterns
(See Additional file 1: "Reconstruction of the gene set of
the Last Bacterial Common Ancestor") which assigned a
COG to LBCA if it was present in several diverse bacterial
clades. All COGs that were present in LBCA and in TT and/
or DR were assigned to the DR-TT ancestor.

Methods
Irradiation and desiccation
Irradiations. Three TT colony-isolates were inoculated
individually in liquid TGY (10 g/L Bactotryptone, 1 g/L
glucose, 5 g/L yeast extract) and incubated at 70°C. Cells
were harvested at OD600 ~0.9, which corresponds to 107 –
108 colony forming units (CFU)/ml; 1 TT cell/CFU. TT
cells grown in TGY were examined for their total Mn and
Fe content by ICP-MS (see main text). For radiation resistance assays, cells were irradiated without change of broth
on ice with 60Co at 6.8 kGy/hour (60Co Gammacell irradiation unit [J. L. Shepard and Associates, Model 109]). At
the indicated doses, cultures (3 biological replicates) were
appropriately diluted and plated on solid medium (8 g/L
Bactotryptone, 4 g/L yeast extract, 3 g/L NaCl, pH 7.3,
2.8% Bactoagar), and CFU counts were determined after 2
days' incubation at 65°C.

Desiccation. Five separate colony-isolates were pre-grown
in TGY as for irradiation trials. Cell samples 106–107 cells
(25 µl) were transferred to microtiter plates, which were
transferred to desiccation chambers containing
anhydrous calcium sulfate (drierite) and incubated at

Phylogenetic analysis
Multiple alignments for phylogenetic analysis were constructed using the MUSCLE program [98]; columns containing gaps in >30% of the sequences were discarded.
Maximum likelihood trees were constructed using the
ProtML program of the MOLPHY package by optimizing
the least-square trees with local rearrangements [99].
Trees based on amino acid content were constructed from
the matrix of Euclidean distances between frequency vectors using the NEIGHBOR program of the PHYLIP package [100]. Support for particular arrangements of species
(relationships between DR, TT, thermophiles and mesophiles) was calculated using the bipartition analysis of
bootstrap samples from original sequences (see Additional file 1, "Influence of amino acid composition on
phylogenetic reconstructions"). The gene-content tree
based on COG patterns was constructed using the
NEIGHBOR program of the PHYLIP package [100]; the
