determination of host range of a novel
bacteriophage LSB-1
Yaming Chai, Hongyan Xiong*, Xiangyu Ma, Liqing Cheng, Guorong Huang, Zhonglin Rao Lin Zhang

Abstract
Background: Bacteriophages (phages) are widespread in the environment and play a crucial role in the evolution
of their bacterial hosts and the emergence of new pathogens.
Results: LSB-1, a reference coliphage strain, was classified as a member of the Podoviridae family with a cystic
form (50 ± 5 nm diameter) and short tail (60 ± 5 nm long). The double stranded DNA was about 30 kilobase pairs
in length. We identified its host range and determined the gp17 sequences and protein structure using shotgun
analysis and bioinformatics technology.
Conclusions: Coliphage LSB-1 possesses a tailspike protein with endosialidase activity which is probably
responsible for its specific enteroinvasive E.coli host range within the laboratory.

Background
Bacteriophages (phages) are widespread in the environment and play a crucial role in the evolution of their
bacterial hosts and the emergence of new pathogens.
They have enormous potential for the development of
new drugs, therapies and environmental control technologies, such as natural, non-toxic alternatives for controlling bacterial pathogens. Recent interest in phages has
been stimulated by studies that demonstrate the efficacy
of phages in preventing and treating infections [1-3].
Phages are readily isolated from water samples in the
environment. Some of the isolated phages have shown
broad-host range interaction with the bacterial isolates
and others have shown either species or strain level specificity. Both polyvalent phages and non-polyvalent
phages are morphologically and genetically diverse [4,5].
They are efficient at host recognition but there is no single method of adsorption, and different phages employ
different strategies [6,7]. Identification of the mechanisms
of adsorption and the host ranges of different phages may
allow genetic manipulation to alter the phage host binding profile artificially. To gain a better understanding of
the biological properties of phages, we have sequenced

the genome of the gp17 from phage LSB-1, which was
isolated from sewage samples. We determined its host
range and analyzed its 3-dimensional structure to identify
possible functional domains.

Results
Coliphage morphology

The LSB-1 phage has a cystic form of 50 ± 5 nm in diameter, with a short noncontractile tail 60 ± 5 nm long
(Fig. 1). It is classified as a member of the Podoviridae
family [8-10].
Nucleic acid characterization

LSB-1 coliphage nucleic acid was sensitive to Dnase I,
but resistant to Rnase A and S1 nuclease (Fig. 2). It was
concluded that all the extracts contained doublestranded linear DNA.
Preliminary overview of the coliphages genome

The shotgun sequencing and a primer-walking method
was used to assemble the whole linear LSB-1 genome of
approximately 30 kb. Fifteen major potential ORFs were
identified, all of which could be assigned functions
based on homology with corresponding genes in the
K1F coliphage in a BLAST search (Fig. 3 and 4).

Genome relationship of LSB-1 and other phages

We chose four important proteins, capsid protein
(gp10), tail tubular protein (gp12), internal virion protein D (gp16), and endosialidase (gp17), which are
present in phage T7 supergroup members, to build
phylogenetic trees. As shown in Fig. 5, 6, 7 and 8,
trees built using different proteins are broadly similar.
Coliphages LSB-1, EcoDs1, and K1F closely clustered
towards the end of the group and phages T7, T3,
phiYeO3-12 and K11 cluster within another branch of
the same group. These data suggest that LSB-1 is
most closely related to the K1F-like phages, and
should be classified as a new member of the K1F
supergroup.

As shown in Fig. 9 and 10, the secondary structure of gp17
protein was composed of 33.10% Alpha helix (Hh), 25.25%
Extended strand (Ee) and 30.29% Random coil (Cc).
The PHYRE program generated several possible templates classified as best fit when the gp17 sequence was
submitted. All of these templates included the sequences
of hydrolase as one of its domains. It also provided the
SCOP codes, E-values and estimated precision values for
the predicted models. Table 1 shows these parameters
provided by different templates.
The endosialidase 3-dimensional structure was chosen
to generate coordinates for the Gp17 of LSB-1 based on
an E-value of 1.1 and an estimated precision of 70%. Using
the PHYRE program, it was difficult to find another closer
coordinate template for Gp17 of LSB-1 even though an
E-value of less than 2e-6 was considered [11-13]. Gp17 of
LSB-1 included endosialidase amino acid residues from
Thr290 to Glu713, with the with the exception of fortyone residues (Ser 465 to Trp475, Tyr497 to Val512, and
Lys543 to Leu562). These forty-one residues did not
match corresponding sequences within the prediction server. The Gp17 3-dimensional structure model predicted
two domains: Domain A with hydrolase activity connected
by an intervening unstructured sequence to Domain B.
The later domain may have a host-anchoring function.
A worm algorithm representation of the model is shown
in Fig. 11. Domain A, the larger of the two domains,
includes residues Thr290 to Phe528 and corresponds to
the N-terminal domain of endosialidase. It comprises 4 a

helices and 9 b strands with intermittent unstructured
intervening regions. The arrangement is characteristic of
crystallized hydrolase. Domain B is composed of 1 a helix
and 9 b strands with intermittent unstructured intervening
regions. It includes residues Gln542 to Glu713 and corresponds to the C-terminal domain of endosialidase. There
were no predicted structural constraints in the connecting
region between domains A and B which included the residues of Tyr529 to Asp541.
The molecular surface structure of the Gp17 is presented in Fig. 12. It shows the catalytic pocket in Domain
A comprising the catalytic triad, Glut405, Arg415, and
Arg487, identical to that found in the endosialidase
family of enzymes. Domain A is shown topographically
in front of Domain B. The connecting region was difficult
to see in this representation because of its opaqueness.

of Gp17and the KIF endosialidase respectively.

Discussion
Previous studies have suggested that gene 17 from the
T7-like and K1F-like phage may be playing an important

role in host range recognition processes [14,15], but little work has been done on comparing their molecular
characterization. K1F-like phages are known to possess
tailspike proteins with endosialidase activity that
degrades polySia with high substrate specificity. These
tailspike-associated enzymatic activities enable the
phages to penetrate the capsular layer and are important
determinants of the bacteriophage host range [16]. The
T7-like phage encodes a tail fiber protein that specifically recognizes and binds to lipopolysaccharide [17]
and recognizes E. coli B and many E. coli K-12 strains.
It was expected that molecular characterization would
provide evidence for a host adsorbing mechanism
of coliphage LSB-1. We found that the LSB-1 has some
common features of the phage K1F supergroup.
A tailspike protein with endosialidase activity is implicated
in allowing a specific enteroinvasive E.coli host range.
Insertion of such an endosialidase gene into a nonpolyvalent virulent phage may artificially increase its host
range to enteroinvasive E.coli. Using manipulation of the
phage genome to kill pathogenic bacteria has broad

(final concentration 50 μg·mL-1) and SDS (final concentration 0.5%) and incubation at 56°C for 1 h. The
nucleic acid was purified using phenol, phenol/chloroform and chloroform extraction. The final aqueous
phase was dialyzed overnight against Tris EDTA buffer
(TE). In this method, nucleic acid yield was estimated
by agarose gel electrophoresis and comparison of ethidium bromide stain intensity with known DNA standards (Hind III cut lambda phage DNA, New England
Biolabs Inc, USA).
The nucleic acid extracts were diluted to a standard
concentration of ~20 ng·μL-1. Approximately 250ng of
each extract was subjected to digestion with DNase I
(Sigma Aldrich), RNase A (Sigma Aldrich) and S1
nuclease (Promega). All reactions were terminated with
the addition of EDTA (10 mmol·L-1 final concentration)
and analyzed using 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis at
5 V cm-1.

[18] was used to determine the host range of the phage.
Lytic activity was examined following overnight incubation at 37°C and recorded on a scale as follows: (N) no
plaques, (T) turbid plaques, (C) clear plaques. To obtain
an accurate estimate of relative phage lytic activity, all
host range determinations were carried out simultaneously using a single high-titer stock of purified bacteriophage and all host cells were incubated at 37°C in LB
medium.
Electron microscopy

To examine phage LSB-1 morphology, 50 μl of purified
viral stock solution was fixed by addition of 50 μl of
0.5% glutaraldehyde in 4% paraformaldehyde and a drop
of this solution was placed on a carbon coated copper
grid After waiting 30 min for settlement, excess liquid
was removed and the grid was allowed to dry. A drop of
2% phosphotungstic acid was added for 2 min before
excess was removed with filter paper before drying and
then examination by TEM (Hitachi, model S-800) at an
acceleration voltage of 45 kV.
Nucleic acid characterization

The method used was based upon that described by
Sambrook and Russell [19]. Bacteriophage from the concentrated solutions were lysed with the addition of
EDTA (final concentration 20 mmol·L-1), proteinase K

Gp17 DNA sequencing and analysis

The coliphage genome was sequenced by the shotgun
method. Genomic DNA was sheared by sonication, cloned
into pUC18 and sequenced with an ABI 3700 automated
DNA sequencer, to give 13-fold coverage of the genome.
Sequences were assembled into contigs, and gaps linked
using a primer-walking technique (Kaczorowski and
Szybalski, 1998) [20]. Potential open reading frames
(ORFs) were predicted using ORF Finder http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/projects/gorf/ and manual correction. Translated ORFs were used in a BLAST search against the
Swiss-Prot http://us.expasy.org/tools/blast and NCBI protein databases http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?
CMD=Web&PAGE_TYPE=BlastHome. Protein secondary
structures were predicted with SOPMA http://npsa-pbil.
ibcp.fr/cgi-bin/npsa_automat.pl?page=npsa_sopma.html.
Phylogenetic trees were constructed using Mega 4
software following published protocols [21,22].
The amino acid sequence of endosialidase was determined
and compared with the protein structure family databases
PDB [23], SCOP [24,25], and PFAM [26] to identify the most
suitable template structure. The eventual template structure
was taken from PDB. Three-dimensional models were created
using PHYRE http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/~phyre/ by mapping the coordinates of the template structure with
aligned residues of the endosialidase. Computer-generated
three-dimensional models were viewed and analyzed using
CN3 D 4.1 application software programs obtained from
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/CN3D/cn3d.shtml.

Conclusions
In summary, a typical Podoviridae morphology and the
double-stranded nature of its DNA give the coliphage
LSB-1 some common features with the phage K1F
supergroup. It possesses a tailspike protein with

endosialidase activity which is probably responsible for
its specific enteroinvasive E.coli host range within the
laboratory.
