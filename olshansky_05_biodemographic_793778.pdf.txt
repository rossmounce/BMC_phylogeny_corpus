Abstract
A new scientific discipline arose in the late 20th century known as biodemography. When applied
to aging, biodemography is the scientific study of common age patterns and causes of death
observed among humans and other sexually reproducing species and the biological forces that
contribute to them. Biodemography is interdisciplinary, involving a combination of the population
sciences and such fields as molecular and evolutionary biology. Researchers in this emerging field
have discovered attributes of aging and death in humans that may very well change the way
epidemiologists view and study the causes and expression of disease. In this paper, the
biodemography of aging is introduced in light of traditional epidemiologic models of disease
causation and death.

Introduction
The timing with which death occurs and the underlying
causes that contribute to it in humans and other sexually
reproducing species have been the subject of scientific
inquiry for hundreds of years, occupying the minds of scientists from widely ranging scientific disciplines [1]. For
example, actuaries (who study humans exclusively) focus
on the practical use of death statistics, as in calculating
premiums for insurance companies or forecasting survival
in order to assess the solvency of age-entitlement programs [2-4]. Demographers have historically worked in
much the same way as actuaries, also on a single species,
by explaining and understanding the trends, causes, and
consequences of mortality within and between subgroups
of the population and across time. In modern times, population biologists and entomologists have begun to study
the demography of death among species other than
humans [5-7]. Unlike demographers, epidemiologists
invoke a disease-specific approach that has its historical

roots in the study of infectious disease epidemics, with a
subsequent focus on chronic diseases and conditions. In
contrast to the scientists who work at the level of populations, biogerontologists examine death for humans and
other species from a micro perspective as they endeavor to
explain and understand changes that occur across time in
molecules, cells, tissues, and organs that eventually contribute to disease and death.
The biodemography of aging is a "new" scientific discipline [7-9], arising in the late 20th century as a product of
efforts to merge the micro analysis of mortality explored
by biologists with the macro analysis of scientists who do
research at the population level (e.g., demographers and
epidemiologists) in order to provide a biological rationale
for the timing and causes of death in humans and other
sexually reproducing species.

The earliest antecedents to the modern biodemography of
aging date back to the French zoologist Georges Buffon,
who demonstrated that "physical laws" regulate the duration of life in humans and other species [10]. These physical laws, according to Buffon, link the biological clocks
that govern growth and development to similar clocks
that he thought influenced duration of life. British actuary
Benjamin Gompertz provided the first mathematical support for this view by demonstrating that for a significant
portion of the human lifespan, the risk of death rises
exponentially with age [11]. The linkage between Buffon's
early life events and Gompertz's regularity in the timing of
death appeared many years later with empirical evidence
demonstrating that for some species duration of life is calibrated to the onset and length of the reproductive window [12]. These observations serve as the foundation for
the biodemography of aging, and might profitably influence the traditional epidemiologic view of disease and
death.
An epidemiological view of disease and death
Epidemiology developed from the long history of human
experience with infectious disease epidemics. An empirically-based science arising during the 18th and 19th centuries, the driving force of the discipline is an effort to
explain and understand in humans, non-random healthrelated attributes of small and large populations, ranging
from the clustering of fevers to age shifts in populations
across time [13]. The necessity for more and better data
led epidemiologists to forge collaborative ties with policy
makers and biostatisticians in order to develop reliable
reporting systems for vital events, such as births, deaths,
and the identification and distribution of specific diseases. These collaborations with scientists from other disciplines exemplify the important interdisciplinary
background of the field [14].

The biology of association (with the exception of genetic
heterogeneity) is neither the main focus of epidemiology,
nor does it assume great prominence in epidemiologic
theory or methods. "Biological plausibility" is widely used
in epidemiologic practice as a pragmatic gauge of the possible relevance of observed associations. Epidemiologists
strive to understand causal factors (genetic or otherwise)
that contribute to age-associated diseases. While epidemiologists have an appreciation of the importance of the
aging process in disease expression, aging per se is not a
focus of research in the discipline. As such, answers to
questions about the lifespan of humans, or any other species for that matter, are outside the usual purview of epidemiology.
During the 20th century, epidemiologists and others in the
field of public health contributed to the first leap in
human life expectancy, as infectious diseases yielded to

http://www.ete-online.com/content/2/1/10

improved sanitation, clean water, better diets, and
increasingly more insulated living and working environments. Rapid declines in death rates at younger ages led to
a redistribution of death from the young to the old, contributing to the accompanying 30-year rise in life expectancy that occurred over the century. Although the rise in
life expectancy in the 20th century is a triumph of public
health and modern medicine, the price paid for this great
success is a developed world dominated by the dual
demographic landmarks of population growth and population aging [15], and a shift in underlying causes of death
from infectious and parasitic diseases to chronic degenerative diseases expressed at middle and older ages [16]. The
field of epidemiology naturally shifted some of its attention away from infectious diseases to the causation and
prevention of chronic degenerative diseases.
Although scientific studies based on theoretical and methodological principles of epidemiology have been instrumental in identifying risk factors for chronic degenerative
diseases (e.g., smoking, fatty foods, obesity, stress, etc.,
and their effects on heart disease, stroke, and many cancers) [17,18], the relative effects of these interventions on
life expectancy at birth are much smaller than those that
resulted from the control of infectious diseases early in life
[19]. This occurs, in part, because the number of personyears-of-life (PYL) added to the life table when a child is
saved from death is almost always considerably greater
than the PYL added when an older person has their life
extended. In addition, while preventive measures have
been shown to reduce death rates at middle and older ages
among population subgroups that adhere to healthy
behavioral practices [20], most of the population has not
adopted these practices. Diminishing increases in life
expectancy at birth in developed nations today, despite
the intensive efforts by epidemiologists and other public
health experts to modulate lifestyles, present a paradox
that can also benefit from a biodemographic examination
of aging and disease.
A biodemographic view of disease and death
Before examining epidemiology from a biodemographic
perspective, it is important to understand the basic theoretical rationale supporting this new paradigm. The modern notion of the biodemography of aging arose in the
early 1990s, as scientists from a broad range of scientific
backgrounds began speculating about the biological
forces responsible for the similar age patterns of death
that they observed among sexually-reproducing species.
The theoretical basis for the biodemography of aging is
derived principally from evolutionary biology [21-24],
but it has roots in historical efforts of scientists who speculated on what was referred to as a "law of mortality"
[11,25-30] â an observation that a consistent age pattern
of death is known to occur across species [12,31-34].

Emerging Themes in Epidemiology 2005, 2:10

Modern biodemographers have theorized that sexuallyreproducing species, including humans, experience a
common age pattern of death because the aging of individuals, and by implication the aging of populations, is
calibrated to life history traits whose own evolution was
unrelated to either aging or duration of life â namely, the
biology and timing of reproduction [8,12].
The link between death and reproduction is based on the
evolutionary principle that the force of natural selection
begins to decline rapidly once reproduction commences,
approaching negligible levels at the end of the reproductive window (i.e., at menopause) [34]. The force of natural
selection refers to the ability of selection to influence the
distribution and frequency of alleles in the population â a
force inherently linked to reproduction. As selection
wanes, alleles with adverse health consequences expressed
at progressively older ages can accumulate in the gene
pool [21-24,35,36]. Evolution is blind to the health consequences of genes expressed in older regions of the
lifespan because there is no selection to act upon them
once they have been propagated. Empirical tests of this
hypothesis have shown that the age trajectory of death is,
in fact, a species-specific phenomenon that, as predicted
from evolution theory, is calibrated to the onset and
length of a species' reproductive window [12]. The reproductive window, in turn, is a genetically determined
attribute that is established as part of a life history strategy
that has been molded by the environment within which
each species evolved. What this biodemographic perspective has taught us thus far is that for each species there is a
fundamental link between the timing of sexual maturation, the length of the reproductive window, and the rate
of increase in the death rate from biological causes of
death. Thus, there is biology in the life table as originally
anticipated by Benjamin Gompertz â a biology that Buffon [10] speculated on in the 18th century, and which is
driven by evolutionary forces that operate through genetic
mechanisms.
Natural selection, the very heart of Darwin's theory of evolution, was based on the biological consequences of
departures from a norm. Darwin's observations about
imperfections in the morphological characteristics of living things were inconsistent with the works of an intelligent designer, which led him to the idea that all forms of
life have an evolutionary history based on change over
time. The life history details such as growth, development,
and maturation that emerge from this unique evolutionary history of every species are central to understanding
the variations that exist between individuals and species
(including humans) in the temporal distribution of agedetermined diseases and the timing of death [37]. Finally,
the implications that the biodemography of aging has for
the degree to which chronic degenerative diseases can be

http://www.ete-online.com/content/2/1/10

influenced by risk factor modification may be of even
greater relevance to epidemiologists â the goal of chronic
disease epidemiology.
An implied perfection of the human body is a persistent
concept that emerged from the major World religions and
has appeared repeatedly in legends from almost every culture dating back to antiquity [38]. These images of perfection describe a distant past when humans were either
immortal or extremely long-lived. The most common historical explanation for the loss of immortality, the lack of
perfect health, and the steady decline in human longevity
has been that each new generation has adopted increasingly more decadent lifestyles. Roger Bacon, an influential
English philosopher and scientist of the 13th century, was
the first to popularize this view [39]. However, he also
believed that the trend toward shorter lifespans could be
reversed by invoking the "secret arts" of the past â namely,
the adoption of more austere lifestyles and the ingestion
of foods and other substances believed to have lifeextending properties. Thus, the perspective that aging and
diseases are amenable to modification through changes in
lifestyles, has its origins in thinking that extends back in
time at least one thousand years.
This persistent belief in perfection and the consequences
of a departure from it has spawned two other beliefs that
continue to have a significant philosophical and practical
influence on contemporary scientific views of mortality.
The most important of these is the belief that aging and
diseases are unnatural and are, therefore, somehow avoidable. The second is the notion that the health and longevity consequences associated with perfection can be
reclaimed through human actions. Elements of this latter
idea contribute to modern epidemiologic thought. These
beliefs, and the quest for longer lives that arises from
them, have been obsessions throughout human history
[40], having become a central part of the paradigm of
modern medicine and the effort of epidemiologists to
understand how risk factors alter death rates.
In modern times, aging is described by some as a disease
that can be reversed, slowed, or even eliminated by
changes in lifestyles or by ingesting vitamins, minerals,
anti-oxidants, and hormones â modern versions of the
anti-aging remedies of the past [41,42]. On the surface,
this philosophy of personal empowerment is seductive.
However, a biodemographic perspective, which is based
in part on an examination of the anatomical structures
and functions of the human body, raises doubts about the
validity of this perspective. For example, from a biodemographic perspective it is suggested that aging and many of
the diseases that accompany it are not deviant departures
from perfection, or even the sole consequence of moderately decadent lifestyles. Instead, they are primarily the

Emerging Themes in Epidemiology 2005, 2:10

consequence of operating our bodies beyond their biological warranty period [43] (i.e., beyond the time when parents can contribute to the reproductive fitness of their
own offspring). Thus, the philosophy that people are
empowered to control their own disease, aging, and longevity has become, in modern times, an ideology of personal blame. In effect, it has become common to blame
people for many of the diseases and disorders that they
experience as they age, and more importantly, some may
be led to believe that aging and the diseases that accompany it are largely avoidable. From a biodemographic perspective, it is certainly true that some diseases and
disorders are entirely preventable and that aging and
death can be hastened by imprudent lifestyles, but once
these harmful lifestyles are avoided, most of what is commonly recognized as aging and disease is an inevitable byproduct of operating the machinery of life. Even though
aging, disease, and death are not programmed into our
genes, once the engine of life switches on, aging is inevitable.
Herein lies the link between epidemiology and biodemography. Modern epidemiology arose out of an infectious disease paradigm where treatments and prevention
were shown to dramatically reduce the incidence and
prevalence of communicable diseases. Once the epidemiologic transition from high to low mortality permitted
most people to survive beyond the end of their reproductive window, chronic degenerative diseases appeared with
rising frequency. Similar epidemiologic approaches to
disease modification were then applied to these diseases
expressed mostly at middle and older ages. Although the
results of this effort have often been dramatically successful (e.g., established linkages between smoking and cancer; obesity and diabetes; and high blood pressure and
stroke), the resulting behavioral modifications have not
led to another quantum leap in life expectancy like that
observed during the 20th century. Instead, what occurred
was a steady decline in death rates accompanied by a
diminishing rise in life expectancy at birth and at older
ages. The phenomenon of diminishing longevity gains
from lifestyle modification is referred to here as the Medawarian Paradox, named after Sir Peter Medawar [23] who
suggested that aging is "...revealed and made manifest
only by the most unnatural experiment of prolonging an
animal's life by sheltering it from the hazards of its ordinary existence" (p.13).
The dramatic increase in the last century in the number of
people living for seven decades or more [44] has revealed
an entirely new set of "weak links" in the structure and
function of the human body that are associated with living well beyond our reproductive years [45,46]. Extended
survival into the post-reproductive period permits a
number of anatomical and physiological features of the

http://www.ete-online.com/content/2/1/10

human body to reveal themselves as debilitating diseases
and disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and osteoporosis. These weak links were not commonly known or
thought of as such in the past because they were uncommon â people rarely lived long enough to experience
them. We define them as "weak links" now because of the
Medawarian Paradox of the unusual circumstance of survival into older ages.
It is important to emphasize that the concept of anatomical oddities and weak links in humans and other living
things is not new. The idea began when Charles Darwin
suggested that imperfections in the design and functioning of parts of living things are inevitable by-products of
natural selection's blind eye to body design. According to
evolution theory, selection does not operate with any particular goal in mind; it simply optimizes the perpetuation
of DNA across time by constructing bodies capable of carrying the DNA and passing it successfully from one generation to the next. This idea has since appeared several
times in the published literature in the 20th century,
including the first detailed presentation of morphology
and body design [47], in later publications by evolutionary theorists [48-51], and in modern discussion of reliability theory [33]. However, neither Darwin nor those
who followed in his footsteps ever examined the morphology of living things from the perspective of an aging
animal.
Epidemiology of degenerative diseases in an aging world
The theoretical and methodological basis for epidemiology arose out of a communicable disease model where a
notion of avoiding and curing the common fatal diseases
of the time was prevalent and enormously successful [35].
As a measure of that success, half of the gain in life expectancy at birth in the 20th century was achieved by 1920 â
largely as a result of public health interventions. As life
expectancy increased, chronic diseases became the overwhelming cause of death, with diseases of the heart, cancer, and cerebrovascular disease accounting for 70 percent
of all mortality. These diseases do not have a single cause,
but usually result from a complex web of causation. The
concept of risk factors was introduced to facilitate understanding and prevention. Thus, smoking was shown to
increase the risk of heart disease and cancers. Fatty foods,
obesity, and lack of exercise clearly predisposed people to
these conditions [52]. However, frustration arose over the
years, as it was shown that these risk factors accounted at
best for only half of the deaths from these three causes. It
is now realized that such phenomena as environment,
psychosocial factors, and genetics also play important
roles [53].

In general, control of chronic diseases has been effective
enough to produce a gradual increase in life expectancy,

Page 4 of 6

Emerging Themes in Epidemiology 2005, 2:10

albeit at a diminishing rate. In developed countries, where
life expectancy is about 75 years for males and 80 years for
females, the classic indicators of health are becoming less
useful. Infant mortality has been very low for more than
20 years and the concept of "premature death" is no
longer a sensitive health indicator [54]. Instead, with each
succeeding year lived at the tip of the exponential curve of
mortality, numerous detrimental physiologic mechanisms and morbidities are activated. Although one role of
the epidemiologist is to improve quality of life, often at
best what can be accomplished is slowing the progression
of diseases and conditions expressed in older regions of
the lifespan by suppressing their symptoms. These include
Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, vision and
hearing loss, hip fracture, osteoporosis and osteoarthritis,
incontinence, depression, social isolation, widowhood,
and institutionalization [55]. In an aging world where the
envelope of human survival is continuing to be extended, a biodemographic perspective leads to the realization that the expression of disease becomes more a by-product of extended survival
rather than the end product of identifiable and modifiable risk
factors.

Conclusion
When the focus of epidemiology shifted from communicable diseases to chronic degenerative diseases, the process of aging intruded into the traditional epidemiologic
model that links behaviors to mortality risks and life
expectancy determination. Now that human survival has
been progressively extended deeper into the post-reproductive period of the lifespan, a biodemographic perspective reveals biochemical and biomechanical forces that
have a profound influence on population frailty, disease
expression, and duration of life. Biochemical constraints
involve the inevitable accumulation of damage that
occurs at all levels of biological organization, including
the maintenance and repair processes themselves â a loss
of biological fidelity that most biogerontologists suggest
cannot as yet be modulated [44,56]. Biomechanical forces
involve the progressive and currently immutable diminishment of structure and function in the very morphological features that give species their phylogenetic identity
[40,46,49,50]. Anticipated advances in research (e.g.,
caloric restriction mimetics, embryonic stem cells, and
progress in the replacement of body parts) will continue
to erode the biochemical and biomechanical barriers to
longevity and quality of life.

designed for extended operation. The diseases and disorders we experience in the post-reproductive period of the
lifespan are, therefore, not flaws from an evolutionary
perspective, and unless proven otherwise, should not be
attributed to personal failure or exclusive by-products of
environmental risk factors. The biological consequences
of aging are crucial factors for epidemiologists, whose
concepts and methods for the pursuit of specific causes
and risk factors are not entirely applicable to animals living long enough to experience the Medawarian Paradox.
Those of us alive today are the most recent recipients of an
evolutionary legacy that includes a human body filled
with both awe-inspiring complexity, and a host of anatomical oddities and weak links that are revealed with the
passage of time. The diseases and disorders that arise from
the negative side of this legacy are unfortunate and unanticipated by-products of the human ingenuity that has
allowed our bodies to be operated far longer than nature
has historically permitted. Had natural selection operated
with a particular goal in mind, such as a healthy old age,
there is reason to believe that the morphological structures and biochemical makeup of sexually-reproducing
species would probably be far different from what is currently the case [46]. It is important to remember that in an
aging world the expression of disease and how long we
live as both individuals and populations is more a product of evolutionary neglect, not evolutionary intent. As
such, traditional epidemiologic models should become
more sensitive to the unique biological forces that come
into play in a world where aging is common and biochemical and biomechanical forces have an important
influence on disease expression and length of life.

An important message in this paper is that biology
reminds us that evolutionary success does not require living to old age, it only requires living long enough to reproduce. Our bodies fail over time not because they were
designed to fall victim to aging and disease at a predetermined age [57], or even because of the acquisition of risk
factors and decadent lifestyles, but because they were not
