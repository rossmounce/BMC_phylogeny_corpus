Abstract
Background: A number of different quantitative trait loci (QTL) for various phenotypic traits, including milk production,
functional, and conformation traits in dairy cattle as well as growth and body composition traits in meat cattle, have been
mapped consistently in the middle region of bovine chromosome 6 (BTA6). Dense genetic and physical maps and,
ultimately, a fully annotated genome sequence as well as their mutual connections are required to efficiently identify genes
and gene variants responsible for genetic variation of phenotypic traits. A comprehensive high-resolution gene-rich map
linking densely spaced bovine markers and genes to the annotated human genome sequence is required as a framework
to facilitate this approach for the region on BTA6 carrying the QTL.
Results: Therefore, we constructed a high-resolution radiation hybrid (RH) map for the QTL containing chromosomal
region of BTA6. This new RH map with a total of 234 loci including 115 genes and ESTs displays a substantial increase in
loci density compared to existing physical BTA6 maps. Screening the available bovine genome sequence resources, a total
of 73 loci could be assigned to sequence contigs, which were already identified as specific for BTA6. For 43 loci,
corresponding sequence contigs, which were not yet placed on the bovine genome assembly, were identified. In addition,
the improved potential of this high-resolution RH map for BTA6 with respect to comparative mapping was
demonstrated. Mapping a large number of genes on BTA6 and cross-referencing them with map locations in
corresponding syntenic multi-species chromosome segments (human, mouse, rat, dog, chicken) achieved a refined
accurate alignment of conserved segments and evolutionary breakpoints across the species included.
Conclusion: The gene-anchored high-resolution RH map (1 locus/300 kb) for the targeted region of BTA6 presented
here will provide a valuable platform to guide high-quality assembling and annotation of the currently existing bovine
genome sequence draft to establish the final architecture of BTA6. Hence, a sequence-based map will provide a key
resource to facilitate prospective continued efforts for the selection and validation of relevant positional and functional
candidates underlying QTL for milk production and growth-related traits mapped on BTA6 and on similar chromosomal
regions from evolutionary closely related species like sheep and goat. Furthermore, the high-resolution sequencereferenced BTA6 map will enable precise identification of multi-species conserved chromosome segments and
evolutionary breakpoints in mammalian phylogenetic studies.

Background
In October 2004, the initial draft of the bovine genome
sequence using a whole genome shotgun strategy has
been released [1,2]. Preliminary assemblies of the current
bovine genome sequence update representing a 6× coverage have been established using whole genome shotgun
sequences (WGS) and BAC end sequences (BES) on
bovine chromosomes and were announced in October
2005 (Pre! Ensembl (Btau 2.0) and NCBI Bos taurus
genome mapview (build 2.1) [3,4]).
A high-resolution physical map will provide a basic
framework to assist the final high-quality sequence assembly and annotation process of the bovine genome for
anchoring genes, anonymous loci, WGS, BES, and preliminary contigs along bovine chromosomes. Subsequently,
the availability of the complete architecture of bovine
chromosomes will facilitate positional cloning efforts
focusing on targeted identification of the causative
sequence variation underlying quantitative trait loci
(QTL) [5].
In order to construct a high-resolution map for a specific
chromosome or targeted chromosomal region, comparative mapping information from maps of the annotated
human and mouse genomes can be utilized efficiently.
The location of bovine loci that are homologues of
human genes may be predicted from the current knowledge about the conservation of synteny between genomes,
but has to be actually proven by direct mapping on the
bovine genome. However, the successful use of genome
information from sequence-ready maps relies upon the
precise identification and characterization of segments of
conserved synteny, gene order, and evolutionary breakpoints in the bovine genome. Radiation hybrid (RH)
mapping has been shown to be a powerful tool to integrate comparative genome data with information from
existing bovine genetic and physical maps to generate
high-resolution maps (e.g., [6]). Considering all RH panels available for the bovine genome, the 12,000 rad whole
genome RH panel (12 k WG-RH, [7]) has been shown to
have the high mapping power required to create accurate
maps of a highly elevated resolution in defined small
chromosomal regions [8-11].
In our study, bovine chromosome 6 (BTA6) was chosen as
a candidate chromosome, because a number of different
QTL for various phenotypic traits, including milk production, functional, and conformation traits in dairy cattle as
well as growth and body composition traits in meat cattle,
have been mapped consistently in the middle region of
this chromosome (e.g., summarized at [12,13]).
Although, initial results focusing on the candidate genes
underlying the QTL for milk production traits at the
molecular level have been reported recently [14-18], fur-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/53

ther structural and functional research is required to dissect the different QTL at the gene-based level.
Previous comparative studies based on fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH; e.g., [19]) and RH mapping (e.g.,
[6,20,21]) revealed that the region associated to the indicated QTL on BTA6 corresponds to two segments of conserved synteny on human chromosome 4 (HSA4).
However, multiple inter- and intrachromosomal microrearrangements with respect to orthologous human chromosomes as reported for several bovine chromosomes
(e.g., BTA13: [8], BTA7: [22], BTA27: [23]) could not be
excluded given the data currently available for BTA6. Consequently, to enable fine mapping of QTL and final identification of causal genes underlying the QTL within small
chromosome segments of BTA6, the content and order of
genes within the syntenic regions need to be defined and
characterized precisely.
Hence, the objective of this study was to construct a highresolution "gene-rich" RH map for the targeted chromosomal region of BTA6. Based on our first BTA6 RH map [9]
and by exploiting the available human and bovine
genome sequence information, RH mapping was utilized
to link both microsatellite markers and genes into an
improved comprehensive, high-resolution map. In order
to increase the number of comparative anchor loci on the
physical map of BTA6 and to refine boundaries for blocks
of conserved synteny, a large number of new genes, which
have been derived from the orthologous region of the
human genome was mapped onto BTA6. In addition,
novel targeted isolated anonymous markers and BES were
integrated into the RH map of the BTA6 region.

Results
Framework and comprehensive RH map construction
A total number of 237 loci (See Additional file 1) including 115 genes and expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were
typed on the cattle-hamster 12 k WG-RH panel [7]. Hundred eleven genes and ESTs have human orthologous loci
in the syntenic chromosomal region on HSA4. No significant sequence similarity to human genes and ESTs was
found for 4 bovine ESTs (FBNE2, FBNE3, FBNL089,
FBNI011). For the 237 loci tested, 211 different retention
patterns were observed. A total of 191 loci displayed
unique retention patterns, whereas 46 shared identical
retention patterns with at least one other locus indicating
no obligate chromosome breaks between them (see Additional file 2).

The retention frequencies of loci varied from 8.9 % for
CSSM59 and PTPN13 to 26.1 % for MANBA, and averaged 15.2 % for all loci. The distribution of the retention
frequencies across the chromosomal region covered is

shown in Figure 1. Retention pattern did not show a consistent bias along the chromosomal region.
The chromosomal region analyzed is represented by one
contiguous RH linkage group at twopoint lodscore (LOD)
criterion 4 comprising a total of 234 loci and by 3 singletons. The positions of the singletons (UGT8, FLJ20032
and CENPE) on BTA6 were retrieved from published
bovine maps [20,21,24]. At twopoint LOD threshold 6,
the large twopoint LOD 4-linkage group is fragmented
into one major group containing 228 loci, and one further
linkage group consisting of 6 loci. Maximum likelihood
multipoint linkage analysis integrated 139 loci (see Additional file 2, highlighted as light green cells) with unique
retention pattern into a framework map at multipoint
LOD 3 as described in Materials and Methods. On the
basis of this framework map encompassing the region
between MANBA and ANTRX2, we sequentially integrated
the remaining loci to generate a comprehensive map with
the most likely order (Figure 2). The resulting marker
order of the comprehensive map spanning 3,685 cR12,000
as determined by the maximum likelihood program MAXLIK is in agreement with the one determined by calculating the order with the minimal number of obligate breaks
option (MINBRK) and by subjecting the proposed order
to a ripple procedure (analogous to the "ripple" function
of the RHMAPPER program) along the chromosomal
region.
The respective chromosomal region of BTA6 we focused
in this study includes the segment between BM1329 as the
most proximal marker and BM2320 as the anchor marker

in the distal part. According to the comprehensive genetic
map [25], this segment comprises a distance of about
91.87 cM. In comparison to our RH map, a genome ratio
of 37.65 cR12,000/cM was calculated, which corresponded
to the value obtained in our initial study (42.8 cR12,000/
cM, [8]). Considering the preliminary bovine sequence
assemblies of BTA6 provided at the Ensembl and NCBI
databases (Btau 2.0 and build 2.1, [26,27]), a ratio of 58.5
cR12,000/Mb was inferred for this chromosomal region.
The average inter-loci interval on the targeted BTA6 region
covered on our RH map is 17.8 cR12,000 corresponding to
approximately 300 kb.
Identification of whole genome contig sequences specific
to BTA6
The comprehensive comparison of our high-resolution
RH map with the genome sequence map of BTA6 required
the identification of additional sequence contig scaffolds
of the existing 6× coverage draft of the bovine genome
sequence specific to our BTA6 region. Therefore, all
sequences (136 loci) integrated in our high-resolution
BTA6 RH map but not placed on the current NCBI
sequence assembly map of BTA6 (build 2.1, [27]) were
used to screen the bovine genome sequence resources
[28]. A total of 73 loci could be assigned to sequence contigs, which were already assigned to BTA6 (see Additional
file 2, labeled in bold red). For 43 loci, we detected corresponding sequence contigs, which were not yet placed on
the bovine genome (see Additional file 2, labeled in blue).
Furthermore, 7 loci (PPP3CA, ADH1B, PDHA2,
OARHH55, ALB, EG1, FGFBP1) were found on sequence
contigs, which had been assigned to other chromosomes

than BTA6 (see Additional file 2, highlighted as yellow

found within the available bovine sequence resources.

Generation of the comparative map
With the aim to construct a high-resolution multi-species
comparative RH map, we started with 52 genes and ESTs

previously assigned to BTA6 [6,9,21,29]. Furthermore, we
added bovine genes inferred from their human orthologs
localized in the syntenic chromosome segment of
HSA4p16.3-HSA4q26, for which corresponding bovine
mRNA sequences were known [30]. To further increase
the number of mapped coding sequences on BTA6 as
comparative anchor loci, we started again from the syntenic human chromosomal region of HSA4 by screening
sequences of known and predicted human genes from this
region using the BLASTN algorithm against the cattle EST
database [28]. This comparative in silico mapping
approach is the targeted version of the COMPASS mapping procedure (e.g., [31]), which utilizes the human-cattle comparative mapping knowledge for predictive
positioning of unknown bovine ESTs on the bovine
genome. Following this targeted mapping approach, we
identified a total of 60 new bovine gene loci (see Additional file 1, highlighted in red) derived from human gene
sequences with known positions on HSA4, and verified
and localized them on the comprehensive RH map of
BTA6. In addition, 3 bovine chromosome region-specific
ESTs (unpublished results) were integrated on our highresolution RH map of BTA6.
A further approach focused on linking 126 anonymous
loci mapped on our RH map of BTA6 (microsatellite
markers, novel targeted isolated markers as sequencetagged sites (STS), BES, and ESTs) with the syntenic HSA4
region by merging sequence and mapping information.
Therefore, these sequences were applied for direct similarity search with the human genome sequence using the
BLASTN program [32] to find positions of orthology on
the syntenic chromosome HSA4. For 44 out of these
anonymous markers, orthologous sequences localized on
HSA4 were identified (35 %). Placement of these 44
anonymous sequences on HSA4 was derived from the
positions of human BAC contigs harboring sequence
motifs homologous to the targeted bovine sequences (see
Additional file 2, highlighted in bold blue). Homology
search of all 126 anonymous sequences against the whole
human genome did not reveal any unique and significant
homologous region on other chromosomes than HSA4.
To better define the BTA6-HSA4 comparative map, the
bovine genomic sequences (WGS contigs) containing the
anonymous marker sequences were used as intermediary
sequences between bovine anonymous loci and the
human genomic sequence as described in Methods. Thus,
comparative positions of anonymous markers without
direct human alignments were established by performing
sequence similarity search on the human genome
sequence with bovine WGS contig sequences containing
the targeted marker sequences. Including the information
from the intermediary alignment procedure, 72 additional anchor points could be localized on HSA4 (see

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/53

Additional file 2, identified HSA4 BACs are indicated as
underlined blue). Ten marker sequences could not be
anchored on the human genome sequence by this in silico
mapping procedure.
Finally, the cattle-human comparative map (Figure 3) of
the defined chromosomal region on BTA6 was generated
by aligning the RH map established in this study with the
orthologous region of HSA4 taking the human genome
sequence assembly as a reference. Physical map positions
of human genes and ESTs for the construction of the comparative chromosomal map based on the coordinates of
the human genome sequence (NCBI build 35.1). For
comparison of the chromosomal organization of BTA6 to
equivalent chromosomes from other species, gene mapping information of genes on orthologous chromosomal
regions [mouse chromosomes 5, 6 and 3 (MMU5, 6, and
3; NCBI build 34.1), rat chromosomes 14, 2, and 4
(RNO14, 2, and 4; NCBI build 3.1), dog chromosomes 3,
13, and 32 (CFA3,13 and 32, NCBI build1.1), and
chicken chromosome 4 (GGA4, NCBI build 1.1)] was
retrieved from the species genome sequence maps available at the NCBI mapviewer database [33]. The comparative map displaying the gene order in the orthologous
chromosomal regions cross-linking our bovine comprehensive 12 k WG-RH map of BTA6 and corresponding
chromosomes from multi-species genomes is presented in
Figure 3.

Discussion
The high-resolution 12 k WG-RH map for BTA6 and
comparison with genetic and physical maps
High-resolution comparative mapping in combination
with sequencing information can be utilized efficiently
not only to create a sequence-ready chromosome map,
but also to contribute to the selection of positional and
functional candidate genes within chromosomal regions
containing genetic variability affecting phenotypes of
physiological and economic importance in cattle. For targeted comparative mapping studies in species with lacking or incompletely annotated genomes like the bovine,
the availability of the complete architecture of human and
mouse genomes provides an excellent resource employing
the information from gene-rich maps of the human and
mouse genomes in combination with high-resolution
synteny RH mapping. This strategy was applied in our
study on BTA6 to powerfully accelerate the research on
genes associated with QTL for lactation and growth
related traits mapped on this chromosome.

The resolution and gene density of the current wholegenome cattle RH maps [6,20,21,34] is often inadequate
either to support the assembly of the bovine genome
sequence or for the molecular dissection of complex traits
in cattle. On BTA6, the proportion of bovine genes that

have been mapped is relatively small and unevenly distributed. To overcome these limitations and to construct
an improved gene-based map, our aim was to enrich previous marker-dominated maps by integrating available
information from anchored genes and by filling in with
targeted selected loci to bridge existing gaps. Therefore,
comparative alignment of the human sequence of the
orthologous chromosome was utilized for in silico identification of bovine ESTs specific for the selected chromosome region of BTA6. Furthermore, an increase in density
of loci on the BTA6 RH map was achieved by targeted integration of novel markers from a microdissection library
[35] and the high-density bovine genetic map [25], particularly in intervals with poor marker coverage.
Out of a total of 237 loci, 234 loci were used to construct
an integrated RH map of high-resolution for the targeted
chromosomal region of BTA6 using a 12 k WG-RH panel.
The average retention frequency of 237 BTA6 loci typed
was 15.2 %. This value is in the same magnitude as the frequencies of 16 % found for BTA6 loci in the bovine 5 k
WG- RH panel [21] and 15.2 % reported in the 7 k WGSunbRH panel [6].
Using RH analysis we have included known genes and
ESTs from currently available BTA6 maps and added a
total of 63 novel genes and ESTs accurately in relation to
the position of known loci onto the map. Hence, the density of genes and ESTs integrated on our RH map exceeds
the density on available bovine genetic and physical maps
of the respective region of BTA6 substantially.
The order of loci determined in our high-resolution, generich map for the targeted BTA6 region is generally consistent with that reported on previous published RH [6,21]
and linkage maps [25,36]. Compared to the SunbRH map
[6], local inversions of loci pairs were found only for 8
placements within small chromosomal segments (Figure
2). These discrepancies observed between adjacent loci in
very close positions could be possibly due to the resolution limit of the RH panels used. Major differences were
only detected when comparing the order of loci in our RH
map to that in the second BTA6 linkage group of the second generation comprehensive map [21]. In contrast to
the latter map, the interval including SPP1, ABCG2,
HERC3, and FAM13A1 is positioned proximal to IBSP in
a reverse order in our RH map. This placement is in agreement with recently published data [14,16]. Taken
together, these two reports and our data provide strong
support for the proposed genomic structure of the chromosomal region of BTA6. The genomic structure of this
chromosomal region is of special interest, because
recently, two different candidate genes for a QTL with
effects on milk production traits have been reported there
[14,17], which requires further detailed structural and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/53

functional analysis of the corresponding chromosomal
area.
To connect our high-resolution 12 k WG-RH map for
BTA6 with the existing 6× coverage bovine genome
sequence assembly, we compared this map with the
sequence map available for BTA6 [26] and conducted
additional BLAST sequence similarity search with
sequences of loci that were not placed there. A total of 116
new placements of loci onto BTA6 were identified providing 73 new assignments onto known BTA6 contigs and 43
placements to sequence contigs from the pool of unassigned bovine sequence contigs in the NCBI archive. In
summary, we found 95 % of all sequences mapped on our
RH map to be presented in the current 6× coverage draft
of the bovine genome sequence exemplarily underlining
its high potential as a framework sequence resource to
represent the molecular architecture of the bovine chromosomes.
Comparing the locus order on our 12 k WG-RH map of
BTA6 with the currently available 6× coverage sequence
assembly of BTA6 [27] as demonstrated in Figure 4, we
found a good overall agreement of both maps, although a
number of discordances were observed. These differences
in locus order focused as followed indicate regions in the
currently available 6× assembly, which have to be considered critically in the course of the curation process to
establish the final sequence assembly on BTA6.
Generally, the order of multiple loci on a sequence contig
agrees with the order obtained by our RH map (see Additional file 2: e.g., loci on NW_931627.1, NW_931635.1,
NW_931636.1,
NW_931661.1,
NW_931643.1,
NW_931673.1, and NW_931689.1). However, orientation of the contigs within the sequence assembly is sometimes opposite to the order of loci in our RH map
(NW_931627.1,
NW_931635.1,
NW_931643.1,
NW_931673.1, NW_931701.1, NW_931689.1). Substantial differences in locus order were observed on the current sequence assembly, when the position of sequence
contigs is arranged in strong contrast to the placement of
the corresponding loci by RH mapping (e.g., for MLR1
and HACP-G
on NW_931678.1; LPHN3
on
NW_931658.1; IOBT450 and KDR on NW_931714.1; PF4
and CXL1 on NW_931715.1). The position of these loci
on our RH map is highly supported, because they entered
the RH map as framework markers. The arrangement of
sequence contigs NW_931635.1, NW_931636.1, and
NW_931634.1 observed in the segment between 15 and
20 Mb on the sequence assembly (comprising the loci
SPP1, IBSP, ABCG2, BMS382, HERC3, and FAM13A1) is
in contrast not only to our RH map but also to published
results based on BAC contigs [14,16] as we discussed
above when comparing the existing RH maps. Further-

more, some loci are represented by more than one assignment onto different sequence contigs in the sequence
assembly [FAM13A1 (15.8 and 19.2 Mb), POLR2B (38.1
and 39.3 Mb), IGFBP7 (39.4 and 40.1 Mb), KDR (35.8
and 44.4 Mb)]. There are 7 loci placed on our RH map (3
of them are framework loci), which are currently assigned
to other than BTA6 specific sequence contigs. These positions of loci with questionable placements indicating
problem areas in the current assembly have to be refined
in further assembly versions.

Based on our 12 k WG-RH map and the genetic map [25],
a mean genome ratio of 37.65 cR12,000/cM was calculated.
The comparison of the resolution of our RH map with the
preliminary bovine sequence assembly of BTA6 revealed
an estimated ratio of about 58.5 cR12,000/Mb. This indicates that one cR on our high-resolution RH map is covered by 17.1 kb on the contig map of BTA6. Aligning the
genetic map with the present contig map, a ratio of
approximately 643 kb/cM could be deduced, a value deviating from the generally expected ratio 1 Mb/cM.

Screening the resources of bovine genome sequence contigs with sequences mapped on BTA6 but without a placement onto BTA6-specific sequence contigs on the current
sequence assembly, we identified 43 new bovine sequence
contigs carrying loci, which were mapped on BTA6 (see
Additional file 2, highlighted in blue). These new assignments have predominantly filled gaps within subchromosomal regions poorly covered with genes (genome
deserts) and could be helpful to guide the validation of
the sequence assembly.

The multi-species comparative map
In comparison to previous published bovine-human
comparative physical maps of BTA6, we were able to
increase the number of anchor points of genes and markers between species. This was the prerequisite to close
physical gaps between linkage groups depicted in the
comprehensive second generation map [21] as well as the
gap between PPARGC1A and IBSP in the SUNbRH map
[6]. Those inter-species breakpoints between human and
bovine, which were already reported in our initial map
[9], could be refined exactly to be between LAP3 and
QDPR as well as between IBSP and DMP1. As shown in
Figure 3, a highly conserved segment comprising the interval from LAP3 to DMP1 on HSA4 (17.25 Mb and 88.94
Mb, respectively) is completely maintained on BTA6 without significant intrachromosomal rearrangements. The
locus adjacent to LAP3 on HSA4, QDPR (17.16 Mb on
HSA4), which is closely positioned with LDB2 and
FGFBP1 (16.18 and 15.61 Mb on HSA4), was anchored
on the distal part of BTA6 closely to BM2320 (Figure 2).
The breakpoint on HSA4 and the chromosomal interval,
which is attached to QDPR, could be inferred by exploiting the currently available bovine genome sequence
assembly. For this purpose, the bovine genomic reference
sequence [28] was screened with the sequence of BM2320,
which detected homology to the bovine BTA6 contig
NW_931791. This contig is located adjacent to the contig
NW_931792, which is predicted to contain MAN2B2
(LOC618061). MAN2B2 is located at 6.7 Mb on HSA4.
Thus, considering the comparative in silico mapping information, it can be concluded that on BTA6, the chromosomal block containing MAN2B2 is attached closely to the
breakpoint-containing segment including QDPR, LDB2,
and FGFBP1. Further chromosomal rearrangements compared to HSA4 were observed in the extreme telomeric
part of BTA6 around MSX1, ACOX3, and LRPAP1 (4.75,
8.48 and 3.55 Mb on HSA4). In order to resolve this chromosomal region accurately and define the breakpoints,
additional loci have to be integrated in the map.

Comparing both, our RH map and the sequence assembly
map of BTA6 to the loci order on HSA4, the BTA6 RH map
shows a lower number of interchromosomal rearrangements with HSA4 than the current sequence contig assembly. As demonstrated in Additional file 2, the order of loci
on the RH map is highly consistent within both chromosomal segments syntenic to HSA4: the inversed segment
comprising loci from MANBA to IBSP as well as the segment comprising the loci from LAP3 to DMP1. There are
only two regions in our RH map indicating rearrangements (between OARHH55 and SLIT2 and within the
region comprising loci DIK082, FBNS8, FBNS9, and RBPSUH), which have to be reanalyzed in further investigations. In contrast, there appeared a significant difference
in the conservation of gene order, when the BTA6
sequence assembly map is compared with HSA4. Considering the high degree of conservation of gene order in syntenic blocks of human and bovine chromosomes as well
as in comparison with syntenic blocks in other species
(see below in the discussion of comparative maps), the
elevated number of intrachromosomal rearrangements
suggested by the BTA6 sequence assembly map seems less
likely than the gene order determined by our RH map.
However, aligning the positions of loci on our RH map to
the preliminary genome sequence assembly of BTA6
revealed an adequate overall agreement in locus order and
distances between loci, although a number of inconsistencies have been pointed up because of misassigned contigs
and rearrangements. This is supported by a correlation of
0.96 between positions of loci given in cR and Mb
(according to Additional file 2).

Comparative cross-species analysis of the gene order indicates a highly conserved organization across the humanbovine breakpoints within the interval from FGBP1QDPR-LAP3 to DMP1-IBSP-SPP1-PKD2 on HSA4, MMU5,

and RNO14. As outlined above, on BTA6 this interval is
shortened to the chromosome segment ranging from
LAP3 to DMP1 due to interchromosomal breaks and rearrangements between LAP3 and QDPR as well as DMP1
and IBSP. The general gene order, however, within this
ancestral interval LAP3 to DMP1 seems to be maintained
across species. Comparing the gene positions on the
mouse and rat chromosomes syntenic to HSA4, the interval at the breakpoint distal from PKD2 is broken again
and placed on different chromosomes: the segment from
ABCG2 to SMARCAD1 (likely more exactly LIM) on
MMU6 and RNO4, respectively, and the segment beginning with BMPR1B on MMU3 and RNO2, respectively.
In chicken the whole chromosomal region of the
HSA4p16.3-4q26 is maintained on chromosome 4
(GGA4, [37]), although, there is a number of intrachromosomal rearrangements resulting in several individual
gene blocks and micro-rearrangements along the chromosome. When compared to HSA4 and BTA6, the syntenic
segment on GGA4 revealing the longest stretch of orthologous genes in identical order encompasses the region
from KIAA1276 to PAICS.
Comparing the chromosomal region analyzed in our
study to the canine genome sequence, the genes orthologous to HSA4 and BTA6 were discovered on canine chromosomes 3, 13, and 32 (CFA3,13, and 32, [38]).
However, several breakpoints differing from other species
were found. The interval ranging from near NUP54 to
CENPE/FLJ20032 on HSA4 is completely located on
CFA32 in an identical order. This interval also represents
the longest syntenic gene interval transmitted without any
breaks. An additional break was observed near KIAA1276,
which was also detected on chicken GGA4. The segment
involving genes from KIAA1276 to LBD2 is located on
CFA3 without any break between LAP3 and QDPR. This is
analogous to the mouse and rat chromosomes MMU5
and RNO14, but in contrast to BTA6. In addition, the
interval comprising MLR1 to UGDH was inversely
mapped on CFA3. The fragment from KIAA1102 to IL8,
which is attached to UGDH on HSA4, appeared on
CFA13.
From Zoo-FISH experiments, genetic, and RH mapping
studies, it is known that the porcine chromosome syntenic to HSA4 and BTA6 is chromosome 8 (SSC8, e.g.,
[39,40]), whereas in horse the corresponding chromosomal region was identified on chromosomes 2 and 3
(ECA2 and ECA3, [41]). Due to the lower degree of details
in gene-based mapping information from the currently
available porcine and equine maps, accurate subchromosomal breakpoints and boundaries could not be retrieved
for the construction of corresponding comparative maps.
The proportion of genes mapped on the orthologous

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/53

chromosomes is relatively small and, consequently, not
sufficient to pursue the positions of the genes that have
been mapped on our RH map of BTA6. For pig, the information we retrieved from several RH and linkage maps
indicates that most of the genes from HSA4 are conserved
on SSC8. In the recently published BAC-based comparative human-porcine physical map [42], 6 conserved syntenic regions from HSA4 were placed on SSC8 indicating
that there a significant higher number of rearrangements
in gene order exists compared to the human- bovine comparative map.
The analysis of the homologous chromosomal regions
between species based on available sequence data and
annotation of genes revealed the occurrence of gene
deserts defined as megabase-size genomic segments
devoid of protein-coding genes. On HSA4, which is populated with gene deserts corresponding to approximately
35 % of the length of the whole chromosome [43], there
exists one outstanding region spanning about 8.5 Mb on
HSA4p15.1, only separated by PCDH7. The second gene
desert interval is located near the pericentromeric segment
on HSA4q12-q13, where LPHN3 is flanked on both sides
by gaps of about 4 and 3 Mb, respectively, without annotated protein-coding genes. When compared to genome
sequences from dog, mouse, rat and chicken, the overall
architecture of the gene desert region around PCDH7 was
found to be conserved in mammals and birds including
the flanking genes [44].
The complete genome sequence assembly of the bovine
syntenic region of BTA6 is not yet available. Therefore, our
high-resolution gene-based RH map of the targeted BTA6
was covered with a high density of anonymous loci in
these gene-poor regions. Anchoring of a substantial
number of the sequences of these anonymous loci onto
HSA4 (see Additional file 2) enabled us to infer that the
overall architecture of these gene deserts seems to be
maintained also on BTA6.
Taken together, most of the rearrangements detected
between the human HSA4 region and the chromosomal
region on bovine BTA6, chicken GGA4, and most likely
porcine SSC8 are intrachromosomal. In contrast, the
respective chromosomal region in rodent, canine, and
equine genomes, is transferred onto two or three chromosomes. Thus, our observations have suggested a higher
number of conserved segments between the bovine,
human, chicken and pig genomes than between the
bovine and the second species group. This implies that the
organization of the human genome regarding chromosomal synteny is closer to that of the cattle, chicken and
pig than that of the mouse, rat, dog, and horse.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the high-resolution RH map for the
defined region of BTA6 presented here integrates anonymous markers, ESTs, and genes from currently available
bovine linkage and RH maps as well as a high number of
comparative anchor loci derived from orthologous HSA4.
Although a number of links to the currently existing
genetic, cytogenetic, and RH maps were possible, a multitude of contigs and scaffolds of the available bovine
genome sequence resources still have to be anchored and/
or oriented on the chromosomes. In this context, our
high-resolution gene-enriched RH map will enable a great
improvement of genome sequence assembly of BTA6 by
linking the physical mapping data with sequence information from the preliminary sequence contig assembly of
this chromosome. With a resolution of 1 locus/300 kb,
our RH map will provide a valuable platform to guide the
comprehensive high-quality assembly of the genome
sequence and gene annotation on BTA6.
Furthermore, mapping a large number of genes on BTA6
and cross-referencing them with map locations in corresponding syntenic multi-species chromosome segments;
our RH map will refine synteny segments at a high-resolution level to decipher mammalian chromosome evolution.
Finally, the connections between available physical and
linkage maps, including cross-species comparative maps
and bovine genome sequence provide a resource for genebased fine mapping of QTL by increasing efficiency of
identifying genes and causal mutations affecting animal
performance. Connecting animal phenotypes associated
with the QTL anchored on genomic sequence level with
putative underlying genes would accelerate the identification of sequence polymorphisms and gene variants and
the development of SNP markers for validation of association substantially.

Methods
Selection of markers and genes specific to BTA6
In addition to the 46 anonymous markers included in our
previous BTA6 RH map [9], 32 markers from the recently
published bovine genetic map [25] and 1 sheep marker
(LSCV43) were selected to fill in defined subchromosomal intervals poorly covered. Moreover, 31 novel anonymous targeted sequence tagged sites (STS: FBNS1FBNS11, FBNS13-FBNS17, FBNS19-FBNS25, FBNS27FBNS34) that have been isolated from a microdissection
library specific for the targeted BTA6 region [35], 10 BAC
end sequences (BES) and 2 microsatellite sequences
derived from 9 BAC clones (see Additional file 3) were
integrated (see Additional file 1, labeled in green). Chromosomal location of targeted chromosome region specific markers was confirmed by synteny mapping using

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/53

the INRA cattle-hamster somatic cell hybrid panel [45].
Furthermore, a total of 115 genes and ESTs were mapped
on our high-resolution RH map. Therefore, in addition to
the 25 loci included in our initial RH map for BTA6 [9],
27 genes and ESTs that all have been previously assigned
to BTA6 [6,21,29] were integrated. Moreover, to enable
identification of bovine sequences homologous to genes
from the HSA4 chromosomal region, BLASTN analysis
against the bovine genome resources (AAFC0200000000)
[28] has been performed with default parameters using 60
mRNA reference sequences of genes located in the targeted interval of HSA4p16.3-HSA4q26 [46]. In addition,
3 bovine chromosome-region specific ESTs (FBNE1FBNE3) known to be located on BTA6 from our unpublished results were included. Whereas FBNE1 displayed
sequence similarity to human HTN1, with FBNE2 and
FBNE3 no homologous human genes and ESTs were identified. The 63 novel genes and ESTs mapped on BTA6
without previous mapping information from published
bovine physical maps are marked in red in Additional file
1. Homologous bovine EST sequences have been aligned
to the corresponding human mRNA and genome
sequences in order to identify the region of sequence
homology, which had to be considered for primer design.
De novo primer pairs were designed using the OLIGO 5.0
program package (National Biosciences, Plymouth, MN,
USA). Primers were preferably designed from ESTs revealing similarity to 3' untranslated regions of genes. If bovine
ESTs showed similarity to the coding regions of the corresponding human genes, primers were designed within
exons. Primers were tested for successful PCR amplification on bovine genomic DNA. In general, successful
amplification was defined as a single amplicon of the predicted size with bovine DNA as visualized on agarose gel
electrophoresis, but absence of the amplification product
with genomic hamster DNA as a control. To verify that
primers amplified the targeted gene, bovine PCR products
were sequenced using PCR primers. Detailed information
on primer sequences and PCR conditions is summarized
in Additional file 1.
Radiation hybrid screening
RH typing has been performed on the 12,000 rad whole
genome cattle-hamster radiation hybrid (12 k WG-RH)
panel [7]. Standard PCR was implemented as touch-down
procedure as described previously [9]. PCR reactions were
carried out in duplicate in a final volume of 10 µl including 50 ng hybrid cell line DNA, 4 pmol primers, 200 µM
dNTPs, 0.25 units Taq DNA Polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 9.0, 50 mM KCl,
0.1% Triton X-100, and 1.5 mM MgCl2. Generally, PCR
products were size-separated on agarose gels stained with
ethidium bromide. PCR fragments of loci faintly amplified were analyzed on polyacrylamide gels visualized by

Page 11 of 15

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:53

silver staining [35]. To better discriminate between bovine
and hamster amplicons, SSCP analysis was applied for
two loci (PDCH7, TXK). For this purpose, PCR products
were separated by running on 0.5× MDE gels (Biozym Scientific GmbH, Hess. Oldendorf, Germany) at 18°C in
0.6× TBE, pH 8.0, including 5 % glycerol, and visualized
by silver staining.
Scoring of results was performed twice in two independent tests. In case of conflicting results, loci were retyped
and reanalyzed. Any remaining discrepancies were scored
as ambiguous.
Radiation hybrid map construction
The RH map construction based on the analysis of the coretention pattern of the loci included using the RHMAP
program package version 3.0 [47]. The program RH2PT
provided data description, e.g., retention rates and assembly of linkage groups based on twopoint analyses of loci.
Multipoint programs RHMINBRK (calculation of map
order with minimal number of obligatory chromosomal
breaks) and RHMAXLIK (calculation of map order with
maximized likelihood given the retention pattern) were
applied for map construction under the equal retention
model. Characteristics of the maps (locus order, number
of obligate breaks) generated by the two multipoint programs were compared.

Starting point for map construction was the largest linkage
group at twopoint lodscore (LOD) 16 comprising 196 loci
with single retention patterns. Taking loci from this linkage group, an initial map was calculated applying a
threshold of multipoint LOD 3. Further loci joining the
LOD 16 linkage group at LOD 12, 10, and 8 were added
sequentially, again applying a threshold of multipoint
LOD 3. The resulting framework map was used as a starting point to add all remaining loci not entering the framework map to generate a comprehensive map displaying
the highest likelihood of locus order. To assess the quality
of the determined locus order the most likely order of loci
within all LOD 16 (20 groups) and LOD 12 linkage
groups (8 groups) was determined and compared to the
final order of the comprehensive linkage group for LOD 8.
Additionally, analogous to the "ripple" procedure to the
RHMAPPER program [48], the most likely order for a sliding frame of eight loci was calculated along the chromosome.
At twopoint LOD 8, two groups of loci (MAPK10BMC4203, FGFBP1-LRPAP1) did not enter the major linkage group of the 196 loci, but established two separate
linkage groups at twopoint LOD 8 or 6, respectively. A loci
order at multipoint LOD 3 and the most likely order of
loci were determined within each of these two groups.
Additionally, loci of these linkage groups were added to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/53

the final order of the major LOD 8 linkage group. Genes
included in these two groups revealed a high twopoint
LOD to two different anonymous markers with highly
confirmed position on published BTA6 maps (BMC4203
and BM2320, respectively). The derived chromosomal
order of these groups was in agreement with this mapping
information and with the localization of ESTs homologous to ACOX3 and LRPAP1 on the SunbRH panel [6].
Thus, the information on chromosomal order was used to
include the two groups for the final calculation of the
physical map distances of our RH map.
BAC screening, sequencing and localization
PCR-based screening of DNA superpools was performed
on the BBI_B750 bovine BAC library [49] available at the
Resource Center, Berlin [50] using sequences from 7
anonymous markers (FBN13, FBN14, FBN20, FBNS10,
BM143, BM3026, and OARJMP36) and 1 gene-derived
sequence (PPARGC1A). Specificity of the identified BAC
clones was verified by direct sequencing with primers used
for BAC library screening. The chromosomal location of
the BACs was determined by Fluorescence in situ hybridization [51]. Identified BAC clones (see Additional file 3)
were end-sequenced with T7 and SP6 primers.
Sequence similarity search on the bovine and human
genome sequences
Sequences from loci applied for RH mapping on BTA6 but
not included in the current sequence assembly map of
BTA6 at NCBI (build 2.1, [27]) were used for sequence
similarity screening in the currently available 6× coverage
draft sequence of the bovine genome [28]. The similarity
search was performed in the database [genome (reference
only)] using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool
(MegaBLAST) with default parameters.

Sequences from bovine anonymous markers (microsatellite markers, targeted newly developed anonymous markers, and BES) mapped on the BTA6 RH map were applied
to similarity search against human genomic sequences
[32] using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool
(BLASTN) to place them in silico on syntenic chromosomal regions of the human genome. For this sequence
similarity screening we selected the NCBI database Homo
sapiens [ORGN] [32] and used default parameters. Only
for the search with short microsatellite sequences, the
expect value was set to 100. The information about comparative placement of the bovine anonymous sequences
on identified human BAC contigs was retrieved from
mapviewer NCBI (build 35.1 version) of the human
genome assembly [46].
If the sequences of the anonymous bovine loci did not
match a homologous sequence on the human genome by
direct similarity search, the bovine whole-genome

Page 12 of 15

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:53

sequences (WGS) containing the targeted anonymous
sequences were used as intermediary reference sequences.
For this purpose, the anonymous sequences, which did
not retrieve human homologous sequences by direct similarity search on the human genome sequence, were
blasted first against the bovine genomic sequence database [WGS contigs] with default parameters [28]. In the
second step, the bovine WGS identified in the NCBI
sequence archive were blasted against the human
genomic sequence as described above for direct bovinehuman similarity search.
Generally, each match found in the sequence databases
was manually curated. Matches were excluded when
revealing less than 95 % identity for within species blast
searches and less than 80 % identity across species. Alignments with less than 30 consecutive nucleotides and
matches containing annotations indicating the presence
of repetitive elements not detected by the Repeatmasker
filter were eliminated.
Comparative map construction
To construct the multi-species comparative maps, gene
positions mapped on the BTA6 12 k WG-RH map were
aligned with corresponding genome map positions on
orthologous chromosomal regions of human, mouse, rat,
chicken, and dog. Gene mapping information was
retrieved from the species genome sequence maps available at the NCBI mapviewer database [33]: human chromosome 4 (HSA4, NCBI build 35.1), mouse
chromosomes 5, 6, and 3 (MMU5, 6, and 3; NCBI build
34.1), rat chromosomes 14, 2, and 4 (RNO14, 2, and 4;
NCBI build 3.1), dog chromosomes 3, 13, and 32
(CFA3,13 and 32, NCBI build1.1), and chicken chromosome 4 (GGA4, NCBI build 1.1).
