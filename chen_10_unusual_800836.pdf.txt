Unusual conservation among genes encoding
small secreted salivary gland proteins from a
gall midge

Abstract
Background: In most protein-coding genes, greater sequence variation is observed in noncoding regions (introns
and untranslated regions) than in coding regions due to selective constraints. During characterization of genes and
transcripts encoding small secreted salivary gland proteins (SSSGPs) from the Hessian fly, we found exactly the
opposite pattern of conservation in several families of genes: the non-coding regions were highly conserved, but
the coding regions were highly variable.
Results: Seven genes from the SSSGP-1 family are clustered as one inverted and six tandem repeats within a 15 kb
region of the genome. Except for SSSGP-1A2, a gene that encodes a protein identical to that encoded by SSSGP-1A1,
the other six genes consist of a highly diversified, mature protein-coding region as well as highly conserved
regions including the promoter, 5’- and 3’-UTRs, a signal peptide coding region, and an intron. This unusual
pattern of highly diversified coding regions coupled with highly conserved regions in the rest of the gene was
also observed in several other groups of SSSGP-encoding genes or cDNAs. The unusual conservation pattern
was also found in some of the SSSGP cDNAs from the Asian rice gall midge, but not from the orange wheat
blossom midge. Strong positive selection was one of the forces driving for diversification whereas concerted
homogenization was likely a mechanism for sequence conservation.
Conclusion: Rapid diversification in mature SSSGPs suggests that the genes are under selection pressure for
functional adaptation. The conservation in the noncoding regions of these genes including introns also suggested
potential mechanisms for sequence homogenization that are not yet fully understood. This report should be useful
for future studies on genetic mechanisms involved in evolution and functional adaptation of parasite genes.

Background
Insect salivary glands are the main organs for producing
proteins that are injected into hosts [1]. Plant-feeding
insects, especially those with sucking mouthparts, inject
proteins and other substances into host plants to facilitate mouthpart penetration, partially digest food before
ingestion, and suppress plant defense [2-4]. Substances,
including proteins with regulatory roles that can alter
host physiology, are referred to as effectors [5]. Pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, oomycetes, and nematodes, deliver various effector proteins into host tissues
[5-8]. Substantial evidence suggests that some of the

salivary proteins injected into host plants by insects also
act as effectors to suppress defense and/or reprogram
physiological pathways of host plants [3,5,9-12]. Gall
midges (Cecidomyiidae), a large family of plant-feeding
insects, apparently secrete effectors into host tissues,
inducing various forms of plant outgrowth (galls) and
altering other aspects of host physiology [13,14]. Plant
galls contain a zone of “metabolic habitat modification”
in which the parasite experiences a selective advantage
because of enhanced nutrition and reduced plant defense
[15]. Several organic compounds and enzymes injected
into host plants by galling insects have been identified,
including amino acids, auxin, proteases, oxidases, and
pectinases [13], but the general composition of the proteins delivered into host plants by gall midges has not yet
been fully characterized.

The Hessian fly, Mayetiola destructor, is the most
destructive insect pest of wheat worldwide [16]. Because
of its importance in agriculture, intriguing behavior,
ease of maintenance in culture, and relatively wellcharacterized genetics, Hessian fly is becoming a model
species for studying insect-plant interactions [17,18].
Hessian fly does not induce the formation of an outgrowth gall, but nutritive cells with similarity to those
inside macroscopic galls are formed at the larval feeding
site [19]. Larvae do not cause extensive tissue damage to
host plants, with their specialized mandibles making
only a pair of small holes [19,20]. Nevertheless, wheat
plants become permanently and irreversibly stunted
after 4-5 days of feeding by a single larva [9]. Even if larvae are removed, growth of wheat seedlings cannot be
restored [9,20], suggesting that larvae inject substances
into host plants that dramatically alter biochemical and
physiological pathways of the attacked plant [21,22].
As the first step to identify some of those proteins
that are injected into host plants, we have previously
generated numerous ESTs from cDNAs derived from
dissected salivary glands of Hessian fly first instar larvae
[23,24]. The majority of the salivary gland transcripts
encode small proteins (50 to 200 amino acids) with typical secretion signal peptides at the N-termini. We refer
to these proteins as “small secreted salivary gland proteins” (SSSGPs). Here we report unusual conservation
patterns of SSSGP-encoding genes and we discuss
potential mechanisms for gene evolution and functional
adaptation.

Results and Discussion
Unconventional conservation of SSSGP-encoding genes

The SSSGP-1 gene family includes seven members and is
clustered as one inverted and six tandemly repeated genes
within a 15 kb region of the genome (Figure 1A). The predicted structures of the genes were verified by comparing
the genomic sequences with cDNA clones corresponding
to genes SSSGP-1A, SSSGP-1B1, SSSGP-1C1 and SSSGP1D1 (a cDNA for SSSGP-1E1 has yet to be identified). All
seven genes have a common structure, including a conserved putative promoter region, a 5’-untranslated region
(5’-UTR), a signal peptide-coding region (SPCR), an
intron, a mature protein-coding region (MPCR), and a
3’-untranslated region (3’-UTR; Figure 1B). Intergenic
regions are small, ranging from 0.2 to 1 kB (Genbank
accession: GU196316). Among the seven genes, SSSGP1A2, present in the inverted repeat, was apparently
recently duplicated and encodes an identical protein with
SSSGP-1A1. The other six genes consist of highly diversified MPCRs as well as highly conserved regions, including
the promoter region, 5’- and 3’-UTRs, SPCR, and the
intron (Figure 1B, Additional file 1, Figure S1A). The predicted proteins are almost identical in their putative signal

peptides, but share little similarity among the mature proteins (Figure 1C). This extreme pattern of diversification
in MPCR, which we refer to here as super-diversification,
coupled with strong conservation in other regions was
also observed in several other groups of SSSGP-encoding
genes (Additional file 1, Figure S1) or cDNAs from Hessian fly (Table 1, Additional file 2, Figure S2).
Except for the common features of diversification/conservation, there are no noticeable sequence or structural
similarities between the different groups of SSSGP
genes, and no apparent sequence similarities could be
detected among different groups with currently available
alignment methods such as BLAST. Most groups of
SSSGP genes contain one intron (Additional file 1,
Figures S1A, S1C, S1D). However, one group lacks
introns (Additional file 1, Figure S1B) and several other
groups contain multiple introns (Additional file 1, Figure
S1E). For those genes containing introns, the first (or
the sole) intron is located either at the boundary
between the SPCR and MPCR, or within the SPCR
(Additional file 1, Figure S1). The positions of intron/
exon boundaries are generally conserved among members within a group. However, deletions or shifts in
intron/exon boundaries occur in gene groups with multiple introns (Additional file 1, Figure S1E). For all gene
groups, multiple members in each group are clustered
within short chromosome regions in the Hessian fly
genome (Additional file 3, Figure S3).
To determine if such a genetic phenomenon exists in
other gall midges, a similar analysis of salivary gland
cDNAs was conducted on two other related insects, the
orange wheat blossom midge (Sitodiplosis mosellana)
and the Asian rice gall midge (Orseolia oryzae). Approximately 8,500 cDNAs from the wheat blossom midge and
3,500 from the Asian rice gall midge were sequenced. In
each case, a similar proportion (45-50%) of cDNA clones
was found encoding different SSSGPs. Forty-eight different groups of putative SSSGPs were identified from the
wheat blossom midge while 25 different groups of putative SSSGPs were identified from the Asian rice gall
midge. Comparative analysis revealed that cDNAs and
their encoded proteins from the Asian rice midge, wheat
blossom midge, and Hessian fly were typically found to
be species-specific; cDNAs from one species shared no
detectable sequence similarity with those from the other
two species, consistent with the rapidly evolving nature
of SSSGP-encoding genes. The species-specific nature of
SSSGP-encoding genes was further confirmed by PCR
and by Southern blot analysis. No PCR amplification
could be achieved using primer pairs designed according
to cDNAs from another species. Similarly, no cross
hybridization could be observed on Southern blots using
cDNA probes from a different species (data not shown).
The typical unconventional conservation pattern of

from pair-wise comparisons of all possible combinations of the genes (see Materials and Methods). Red color indicates conserved regions. Blue
color indicates diversified regions. The lowest score for any pairwise comparison in the MPCR was 13. Unrelated random sequences can produce
scores as high as 15. The actual alignments of these genes are shown in Additional file 1, Figure S1A. C: Sequence alignments of putative
proteins. Dashes represent gaps in the sequence alignments. The first 18 amino acids constitute a putative signal peptide.

SSSGP-encoding genes observed in Hessian fly was also
found in some of the SSSGP-encoding transcripts of the
Asian rice midge (Additional file 2, Figure S2G), but not
in any transcripts of the wheat blossom midge. This
observation indicates that the unconventional conservation of SSSGP-encoding genes might be linked to adaption to environmental changes such as a change in host
plants. Even though they live on different plant species,
the Asian rice midge and Hessian fly larvae share a similar feeding mechanism. Larvae of both species feed on
the meristem of a leaf-sheath within a plant, and their
survival strictly depends on their ability to induce the formation of nutritive cells of plant tissue at the feeding site,
to inhibit plant growth, and to suppress host defense
[17,19,25]. Wheat blossom midges, on the other hand,
feed on developing wheat seeds and either do not require
extensive manipulation of host plants such as growth

inhibition [19], or manipulate host plants in different
ways.
Several genes from different mosquito species have
been found encoding diverse secreted salivary proteins
and some of these genes are also organized as tandem
repeats [26]. Diverse toxic small peptides have been
found in the venoms of predatory cone snails [27]. However, the extreme cases described here with a very short
(100 to 500 bp), highly diversified segment followed by a
very short (~500 bp), highly conserved segment arranged
as multiple tandem repeats has not been found in any
other organisms.
Strong positive selection on SSSGP loci and alleles

Strong positive (diversifying) selection appears to be one
of the forces driving diversifications in MPCRs. Highly
diversified members with less than 80% sequence identity

Score average (AVE) and score range were derived by pair-wise comparison (Materials and Methods). Except for the two members from group SSSGP-6, the score
average for MPCR is at least 40% less than those for other regions. The two members from group SSSGP-6 are likely relatively recent duplicates since they share
an overall 83% sequence identity. The score average for these two members is 13% less than those for other regions.

within MPCRs did not produce meaningful alignments
for analyzing nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution ratio (dN/dS), but the fact that the coding regions
are hard to align is itself evidence for fast evolution by
positive selection or other mechanisms such as Y-family
polymerases [28]. Analysis of moderately diversified
group members with 80 to 95% sequence identity in their
MPCRs all yielded dN/dS above one (Table 2, Additional
file 4, Figure S4). One pair of group members produced a
dN/dS ratio above 18, indicating very strong positive
selection. Due to the small size, similar sequences with
greater than 95% sequence identity within MPCRs did
not possess sufficient nucleotide substitutions to confidently discern evolutionary patterns through analyzing
dN/dS. However, a different analysis of similar sequences
derived from different alleles also produced strong
evidence for positive selection (below).
Multiple transcripts corresponding to genes SSSGP1A1, SSSGP-1B1, and SSSGP-1C1 were isolated from
three different Hessian fly populations. These different
transcripts were likely derived from different alleles
since evidence from in situ hybridization, Southern blots
with genomic and BAC DNA samples, and primer specific PCR suggests a single locus for this gene family
(Additional file 5, Figure S5). The ratio between nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions was 1.5 or
more within the MPCR, but less than 0.9 in the SPCR
(Table 3, Additional files 6 and 7), again indicating positive selection in MPCRs for different alleles.
Evidence for positive selection is not common but has
been demonstrated at several different types of genes controlling interactions between organisms that are mediated
by molecular recognition. Typical examples are defenserelated genes including the major histocompatibility complex [29], immunoglobulins [30], defensins [31], plant
resistance genes [32], plant chitinase genes [33], and
pathogen effector genes [34]. The strong positive

selection observed in SSSGP-encoding genes indicated
that SSSGPs are also likely involved in interactions
between Hessian fly and other organisms. Considering
that Hessian fly larvae live within host plants, some of
these SSSGPs may be secreted into host plants as effector proteins with a role in the insect’s virulence. In
plant-herbivore interactions, successful pathogens and
parasitic arthropods not only require a large number of
genes coding for effector proteins to suppress innate
defense of host plants [35], but also require the ability
to change this arsenal in response to shifts in the host
population [36]. Evolution of plant populations in parasite recognition and surveillance systems thus provides
strong selection for counter changes in effector proteins

cDNAs were derived from three Hessian fly populations: biotype GP, biotype L, and a Syrian population (S). As a control, cDNAs coding for 26 different ribosomal
proteins (RPs) that were isolated along with SSSGP cDNAs were included in this analysis. Sequence alignments for different SSSGP cDNAs are shown in Additional
file 6, Figure S6 whereas alignments for RP cDNAs are shown in Additional file 7, Figure S7. “Nonsyn/Syn” represents the ratios of non-synonymous against

from parasites [36,37]. The Hessian fly has been very
successful in adaptation to changes in host plant populations [16,17]. The super-diversification in SSSGP genes
may have provided the genetic basis for the development of counter-resistance in Hessian fly in response to
changes in host plants.
Concerted homogenization of noncoding regions

Very strong selection for divergence could account for
rapid divergence of MPCR but the high homology of
the other regions of the genes is difficult to explain.
Recombination between gene-family members, particularly those arranged in tandem arrays, acts to homogenize their sequences so they evolve in a concerted
fashion [38,39]. Typically, however, this homogenization
occurs throughout the whole gene and even the intergenic regions, not just specific domains in the genes.
While crossover events would tend to homogenize the
whole array, smaller gene conversion events might
homogenize smaller regions. Little is known about
recombination in gall midges, but conversion tracts at
the Rosey locus of Drosophila have been found to be in
the order of a few hundred base pairs [40]. Differences
in sequence affinity among the various sub-regions of
the SSSGP-1 family members corroborate frequent
recombination in short DNA regions during Hessian fly
evolution (Figure 2). The homogenization could be confined to termini of the genes if the conversion events
were initiated near the ends of the genes or in intergenic
regions. The nature of recombination hotspots varies
between species [41], but they are commonly initiated
intergenically [42], possibly at specific sequence motifs
[43] or regulatory regions. Sequence heterogeneity in
the MPCR due to strong positive selection could, in
turn, affect the length of conversion tracks or how the
recombination intermediates are resolved; conversion or
crossover events [44]. If the sequence homogeneity of the
SSSGP-encoding families was caused by concerted evolution from short conversion tracks initiated in the flanking
regions, one would expect introns in the middle of the
larger genes to be less homogenized. This is in fact what
was observed in the SSSGP-2 family; noticeably, several

introns (introns 22, 23, 26, 27, 35, 36, 37) were rearranged or deleted (Additional file 1, Figure S1E). The
coding regions of the two SSSGP-2 family members correspond to approximately 950 nucleotides with 35
introns.
To explore whether functional adaptation might
explain conservation of certain regions of gene families
[45], we analyzed the patterns of transcript levels corresponding to specific genes under different conditions
(Figure 3). In general, SSSGPs with higher sequence
similarity in the promoter regions had more similar patterns of gene expression (Figures 2, 3). SSSGP-1A1,
SSSGP-1A2, SSSGP-1B1, and SSSGP-1C1, whose promoters were very similar (Figure. 2C), also exhibited similar
expression patterns among tissues (Figure 3A) and
developmental stages (Figure 3B), and among insects
interacting with different plant genotypes (Figure 3C).
The promoters of SSSGP-1C2, and SSSGP-1E1 were also
similar to each other (Figure 2C), and these two genes
also exhibited similar transcription patterns. However,
the genes in the first group (SSSGP-1A1, SSSGP-1A2,
SSSGP-1B1, and SSSGP-1C1) and the second group
(SSSGP-1C2 and SSSGP-1E1) had strikingly different
expression patterns (Figure 3). Small differences in the
transcription patterns among members in the same promoter group were also observed. For example, SSSGP1C2 was expressed abundantly in 0.5-day old larvae
(Figure 3B, 1C2), whereas little SSSGP-1E1 expression
was observed in the same larvae (Figure 3B, 1E1). These
differences could indicate that small differences in the
promoter (or other regulatory elements in other regions)
of the genes can fine-tune the level of transcripts to
satisfy specific requirements. These observations suggest
that the conservation/diversification of the promoter
regions has been strictly driven by functional adaptation.
The homogenization of 5’- and possibly even 3’-UTRs
may also have a functional basis. Because UTRs play critical roles in post-transcriptional regulation of gene
expression [46,47], we speculate that the SSSGP UTRs
are critical for proper post-transcriptional regulation.
For example, part of the conserved UTRs could serve as
elements for binding with regulatory proteins or as

pairing sites for interacting with micro-RNAs that may
affect RNA stability or translation efficiency [48]. Multiple layers of gene regulation may be needed to ensure
spatial and tissue-specific expression and prompt
response of SSSGP-encoding genes to changes of host
and other environmental conditions.

Functional division of SSSGPs: initiators and maintainers

SSSGPs appear to have a division of labor, with “initiators” expressed only immediately after the start of feeding
and “maintainers” expressed at later stages in the time
course of feeding and plant response. Initiators, such as
SSSGP-1C2 and SSSGP-1E in the SSSGP-1 family, were
predominantly expressed in salivary glands (Figure 3A) at

Page 7 of 10

early stage of larval development (Figure 3B), and their
expression was elevated at later time points in larvae
feeding on resistant plants (Figure 3C). These observations are consistent with the postulation that initiators
are secreted into plant tissue as effectors to manipulate
plant cells. Hessian fly suppresses plant defense and
induces the formation of nutritive cells within the first
couple of days [9,19]. Once the insect has successfully
manipulated host plants, one would expect that the
expression of initiators is no longer needed. Indeed the
manipulation of wheat seedlings is irreversibly achieved
within the first few days following the Hessian fly initial
attack [9]. The elevated expression of initiators in larvae
feeding on resistant plants at later stages may reflect the
fact that Hessian fly larvae continue to secret effectors to
counter increased plant defense in these plants [21,22].
Maintainers, such as SSSGP-1A, SSSGP-1C1, and
SSGP-1C1, were also expressed in other tissues besides
the salivary glands (Figure 3A). The proteins produced in
Malphigian tubules and carcass are unlikely to play a role
in interaction with host plants, but could play a role in
regulating Hessian fly symbiotic or associated microbes
in insect tissues [49]. In addition, some SSSGPs could
also play a role in regulating secondary microbial infection of the host tissues damaged at the feeding site [50].
The maintainers may possess antimicrobial activity, and
are under selection pressure from changes in microbial
populations. Further research on the network of these
initiators and maintainers encoded by rapidly evolving
genes will shed light on the biology and feeding behavior
of gall midges.

Figure 3 Distribution and abundance of transcripts
corresponding to specific SSSGP-1 family members. A: Transcript
distribution among tissues was determined using 3-day old biotype
GP larvae. The remains after removing salivary glands, gut, and
Malphigian tubules were designated as carcass. B: Transcript
abundance in 0.5 to 12-day old larvae on susceptible wheat plants
(cultivar ‘Newton’). C: Transcript abundance in 0.5 to 4-day old
(dying) larvae on resistant wheat (cultivar ‘Molly’ containing H13
R-gene). Primer pairs and methods are shown in Additional file 8,
Table S1.

Conclusion
In this study, we observed an unconventional conservation
pattern in genes encoding SSSGPs in the Hessian fly.
In the SSSGP-encoding genes, noncoding regions are
highly conserved whereas regions coding for mature proteins are highly diversified. Rapid diversification in mature
SSSGPs suggests that the genes are under selection pressure for functional adaptation. Considering the fact that
most SSSGP-encoding genes are exclusively expressed in
salivary glands, it is likely that rapid diversification in
SSSGP-encoding genes is for the insect to counter changes
in host plants for virulence. The conservation in the noncoding regions of these genes including introns also suggested potential mechanisms for sequence homogenization
that are not yet fully understood. This report should be
useful for future studies on genetic mechanisms involved
in evolution and functional adaptation of parasite genes.
Methods
DNA libraries and sequencing

cDNA libraries and sequencing were as described previously [23,24]. A BAC library with 5× coverage was

Chen et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:296
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/296

made from biotype GP Hessian fly larvae through a commercial contract with Amplicon Express (Pullman, WA).
The BAC library contains inserts with average size of
~150 kB ligated into Hind III of pECBA1. A positive
BAC clone, 10A23, was identified by screening the BAC
library with a cDNA probe corresponding to the SSSGP1C1 gene. A shotgun library with average sizes of 1.5 kB
was made with 10 times coverage of the BAC clone
10A23, again through a commercial contract with Amplicon Express. The shotgun library was sequenced using
ABI 3730 DNA analyzer at Kansas State University DNA
sequencing facility. The shotgun sequences were
assembled using Cap3 [51] and confirmed by PCR amplification and resequencing. The sequence of the whole
BAC clone is 130 kB and was deposited into Genbank
with accession number GU196316. The 15 kB cluster
was located in the middle region toward 5’-end of the
BAC.

on a 0.8% agarose gel and blotted onto GeneScreen
membrane (Perkin Elmer, Beltsville, MD). The membranes were then hybridized separately to individual
probes of cDNAs from either the Hessian fly, or Asian
rice midge, or wheat blossom midge. cDNA probes were
produced with 32 P dCTP using a random labeling kit
from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Hybridization was carried
out overnight at 42°C in a plastic bag containing a 15-mL
hybridization solution, which consisted of 10% dextran
sulfate, 1% SDS, 1 M NaCl, pH 8.0. After hybridization,
the membranes were washed twice with 2 × SSC at room
temperature for 30 min, twice with 2 × SSC (0.3 M
sodium chloride and 30 mM tri-Sodium citrate dihydrate,
pH 7.0) plus 1% SDS at 65°C for 30 min, and twice with
0.1 × SSC plus 1% SDS at room temperature for 30 min.
Images were visualized by exposing the membranes to
Kodak SR-5 X-ray film overnight.

Additional material
Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRTPCR) analysis

RNA extraction, reverse-transcription and real-time PCR
were carried out as described previously [24]. Two hundred larvae or tissues from 200 larvae were collected
and pooled for RNA isolation for each replicate. Three
biological replicates were included for each analysis. The
ratio between abundances on resistant plants and the
corresponding ones on susceptible plants were calculated. Primers used for PCR reactions are listed in Additional file 8, Table S1.
Sequence analysis and comparison

Sequence alignments and comparison were conducted
using ClustalW [52]. For pairwise comparison, each
sequence was compared with every other sequence.
Scores for individual alignments are calculated based on
the method of Wilbur and Lipman [53]. The higher the
score is for a pairwise alignment, the higher the degree of
conservation is between the two aligned sequences. Average scores were derived by dividing the sum of all pairwise scores with the number of alignments. Score range
was the lowest score to the highest score among all pairwise alignments. For analysis of nucleotide substitutions,
pair-wise alignments were obtained using ClusterW.
Nonsynomonous (dN) and synomonous (dS) substitution
ratios (dN/dS) were obtained using PAML42 [54].
Phylogenetic trees were produced based on neighbor
joining and maximum likelihood using MEGA4 [55].
Southern blot analysis

Hessian fly genomic DNA was isolated following a salting
out protocol [56]. For Southern blot, 10 μg of purified
genomic DNA was digested with individual restriction
enzymes. The digested DNA fragments were separated
