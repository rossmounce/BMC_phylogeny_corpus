Abstract
Background: Identification of DNA sequence diversity is a powerful means for assessing the
species present in environmental samples. The most common molecular strategies for estimating
taxonomic composition depend upon PCR with universal primers that amplify an orthologous
DNA region from a range of species. The diversity of sequences within a sample that can be
detected by universal primers is often compromised by high concentrations of some DNA
templates. If the DNA within the sample contains a small number of sequences in relatively high
concentrations, then less concentrated sequences are often not amplified because the PCR favours
the dominant DNA types. This is a particular problem in molecular diet studies, where predator
DNA is often present in great excess of food-derived DNA.
Results: We have developed a strategy where a universal PCR simultaneously amplifies DNA from
food items present in DNA purified from stomach samples, while the predator's own DNA is
blocked from amplification by the addition of a modified predator-specific blocking primer. Three
different types of modified primers were tested out; one annealing inhibiting primer overlapping
with the 3' end of one of the universal primers, another annealing inhibiting primer also having an
internal modification of five dI molecules making it a dual priming oligo, and a third elongation arrest
primer located between the two universal primers. All blocking primers were modified with a C3
spacer. In artificial PCR mixtures, annealing inhibiting primers proved to be the most efficient ones
and this method reduced predator amplicons to undetectable levels even when predator template
was present in 1000 fold excess of the prey template. The prey template then showed strong PCR
amplification where none was detectable without the addition of blocking primer. Our method was
applied to identifying the winter food of one of the most abundant animals in the world, the
Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba. Dietary item DNA was PCR amplified from a range of species in
krill stomachs for which we had no prior sequence knowledge.
Conclusion: We present a simple, robust and cheap method that is easily adaptable to many
situations where a rare DNA template is to be PCR amplified in the presence of a higher
concentration template with identical PCR primer binding sites.

Background
Euphausia superba is the dominant krill species in the Antarctic and a key component of the Southern Ocean ecosystem [e.g. [1]]. The population of Antarctic krill in the
Scotia Sea alone is estimated to be 208 million tonnes [2]
and the krill fishery has the potential to become the
world's largest fishery [3]. It has long been recognized that
Euphausia superba feeds primarily as a herbivore during the
phytoplankton-rich periods of spring and summer, at
least during daytime [e.g. [4], although heterotrophic
food items are also known to be consumed [5]]. However,
there is uncertainty about how adult Antarctic krill survive
the winter. A variety of strategies have been proposed
since krill do not seem to build up large fat reserves. These
strategies include shrinkage [e.g. [6,7]], lowered metabolic rates [8,9], switching to omnivory [10] or feeding on
ice associated biota [e.g. [11]].
Krill diet is difficult to fully characterise because they feed
on a very wide taxonomic range of prey items. The diversity of prey consumed by krill means that many dietary
analysis methods will produce biased results because of
the difference in detectability of different prey items. As a
result of this, a number of methods for analysing krill diet
have been tried.
DNA-based methods are perhaps the most promising
ones and are now established as powerful tools for studying food chains [12]. Their advantage lies in enabling
identification of prey when the remains are degraded or
lack hard parts. As species-specific DNA sequences are
moderately easy to identify, these methods are also generally better at making species-level identifications than
other biomarker methods such as stable isotopes, signature lipids and antigen detection [13]. However, the predominance of one DNA template within a single sample
can bias or restrict molecular analysis [14,15]. This is
often the case in diet studies since prey DNA in stomachand faecal samples tend to be far more degraded than
predator DNA. The extent of this overabundance of amplifiable predator DNA increases with the size of the target
fragment [16,17].
PCR (polymerase chain reaction)-based methods using
universal primers will not be sensitive enough to detect
low-abundance sequences since rare prey templates have
a tendency for being missed in the early stages of the PCR.
The universal primers which are conserved among the target prey species usually also amplify DNA from the predator by necessity, and hence prey-DNA is masked by
predator-DNA [18,19]. Several approaches have therefore
been applied in order to avoid only detecting the predator-DNA.

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/5/1/12

One of these methods is to remove predator DNA after
PCR amplification by restriction enzymes [e.g. [20,21];
Figure 1]. But this method requires a unique cutting site in
the predator sequence, which is often difficult to find. Furthermore, it will not work if the PCR has failed to amplify
prey DNA because the predator DNA has dominated the
PCR totally. A method (the SuPER-method) to cut only
target DNA in a mix prior to PCR has been applied by
Green and Minz [15] investigating microbial diversity, but
this method still requires several extra handling steps and
has apparently not achieved wide acceptance.
Another common method is to design species specific
primers or probes for the detection of prey species of interest [e.g. [22-24]; Figure 1]. This approach is however not
suitable if the potential range of prey species is large
(given the need to design perhaps hundreds of probes) or
unknown (making it impossible to design prey specific
probes a priori). This is clearly the case with krill diet. It is
also possible to design group specific primers targeting
broader groups of potential prey, but not the predator
[e.g. [25]]. This approach has previously been applied to
studying the diatom component of Antarctic krill diet
[26]. However, developing group-specific primers is problematic if they are designed for groups where complete
sequence coverage is not available. In such situations the
group specific primers might screen away not only predator DNA but also DNA from prey species of interest.
One way to avoid only detecting predator DNA, and at the
same time ensuring that no potential prey is screened
away, is to use universal PCR primers accompanied by a
method that specifically blocks predator DNA from
amplification.
"PCR-clamping" where peptide nucleic acids (PNAs),
locked nucleic acids (LNAs), or morpholinos are used to
suppress PCR amplification of wild-type or dominant
sequences is one such method [see [27] for a recent
review]. PNA/DNA duplexes for example have a higher
melting temperature compared with DNA/DNA duplexes
[28] and do not prime DNA polymerisation [29]. Hence,
a sequence-specific PNA probe overlapping one of the
PCR-primer attachment sites within the target sequence of
interest will not work as a primer. This method has been
widely applied to minimize amplification of the dominant sequence in the fields of clinical chemistry [e.g. [30]],
environmental microbiology [e.g. [31]], parasitology
[32], and to detect genetically modified organism content
in food [33], but not to our knowledge in diet studies.
However, synthesis time for clamping probes is several
weeks and these probes are also quite expensive.
A simpler method compared to PCR-clamping is to use a
predator specific blocking primer (i.e. a DNA oligo that

reducing amplification of a bacterial sequence that otherwise would have dominated the clone library [35]. In this
study we test the application of blocking primers in diet
studies and apply the method to assessing the diet of Antarctic krill caught during the austral autumn and winter.

(as chosen by Liles et al. [35]), a phosphate ester, or using
an inverted 3'-3' linkage would also prevent elongation.
However, side reactions during deprotection of the oligonucleotide or enzymatic impurities may free the 3'hydroxyl group to a small extent, and these methods are
not so effective in blocking as C3 spacers CPG [38,39].

Methods
Primer design
Primers applied in analysing of gut content of predators
should ideally target short sequences of multiple-copy
DNA because of the degraded nature of the prey derived
sequences [13,16,17,36]. The ribosomal DNA is therefore
often used as a target for PCR amplification in diet studies
because ribosomal DNA (rDNA) genes are repeated tandemly in high copy numbers and are highly conserved
within species [37]. We designed 'universal' PCR primers
that amplify a short, but fairly variable region of the 28S
rDNA from all eukaryotes tested. We also designed three
blocking primers intended to bind to the Euphausia
superba sequence amplified by the universal primers. The
primers used in this study are given in Table 1 and shown
aligned with the krill sequence in Figure 2.

The blocking primer, 'Short28SR-blkKrill3'c3' overlapped
with the 3' end of the reverse universal primer, but
extended into krill-specific sequence and was modified
with a C3 spacer at the 3'-end (Figure 2). We needed a
modification which was 100% synthesized (i.e. no oligos
missing it) and which was stable (i.e. no degradation or
enzymatic removing of the modification after synthesis).
Even if just a small percentage of the blocking primers
were to prime amplification of predator DNA as a result of
not having the 3' modification, this would render the procedure unworkable. C3 spacer (3 hydrocarbons) CPG is a
standard primer modification available from most suppliers of custom oligonucleotides. Adding this modification
to the 3'-end of an oligonucleotide prevents elongation
during a PCR without noticeably influencing its annealing
properties. Because oligos are synthesized from a 3' to 5'
direction, all molecules will be modified with the 3' modification. Modifying the 3'- end with a phosphate group

Because finding an appropriate binding site for a species
specific primer next to a binding site of a universal primer
is often difficult, a krill specific blocking primer,
Short28SF-DPO-blkKrill overlapping with the 3'end of
the forward universal primer and having an internal modification of five deoxyinosine (dI) molecules in addition
to the C3 spacer modification was also designed (Figure
2). Very long conventional oligonucleotides often do not
work. In general, primers longer than 25 bases are rarely
used since their Tms can be over 70°C, which is too high
for effective PCR cycling [40]. Long primers also often
generate many non-specific bands resulting from nonspecific annealing. A dual priming oligonucleotide (DPO)
[41] contains two separate priming regions joined by a
polydeoxyinosine linker. DPOs does not suffer from the
limitations of a high Tm since the linker assumes a bubble-like structure resulting in two primer segments with
distinct annealing properties. Furthermore, the bubblelike structure of linker efficiently prevents primer-dimer
and hairpin structure formation [41].
The Short28SR-blkKrill3'c3 and the Short28SF-DPOblkKrill blocking primers were both designed to prevent
annealing of the unmodified version of the universal
primer on krill sequences. Further a third krill specific
blocking primer situated between the two universal primers was tested (Figure 2). This was an "elongation arrest"
primer ([42]; Figure 1) and also had a C3 spacer at its 3'
end.
Sampling and DNA extraction
Total genomic DNA was extracted from ethanol-preserved
specimens of Antarctic pelagic invertebrates or cultured
algal species (Table 2).

Krill were collected during two cruises in eastern Antarctic
waters with RSV Aurora Australis. The first cruise took place
during the austral autumn and the second in late austral
winter (Table 2). Krill were collected using Rectangular
Midwater Trawl-8 net by standard double oblique tows
from the surface down to 200 m or by target towing at
aimed depths of 100 m or 16–60 m (Table 2). The vessel
speed during net towing was maintained at 2 knots.
Immediately after capture, krill were put into jars containing 80% ethanol as recommended by Passmore et al. [26].

After 1–6 months storage krill stomachs (foreguts) of ethanol rinsed krill were dissected under a dissecting microscope in sterile Petri dishes using flame sterilized forceps.
Care was taken so the stomach was not in contact with any
outer parts of the krill's exoskeleton. The stomach was
then briefly rinsed in fresh ethanol and put into an autoclaved DNA free Eppendorf tube filled with ATL buffer
(Qiagen). The sample was homogenized using a sterile
plastic pestle prior to DNA extraction.

All DNA was extracted with a DNeasy Blood & Tissue kit
(Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instruction for animal tissue and total DNA yield and quality of final extractions (100 μL) was determined using Picofluor 8000-004
(Turner Designs) and samples stained with Quant-iT
PicoGreen ds DNA reagent (Molecular Probes).
Testing of blocking primers
To evaluate the efficiency of the different types and different amounts of blocking primers, artificial rDNA mixtures
were created. First PCR amplification were performed on
krill and Pyramimonas DNA with the universal 28S rDNA
primers Short28SF and Short28SR (Table 1) as 25 μL reactions with 0.25 μL of each oligo (10 μM), 0.25 μL dNTP,
2.5 μL 10×, 0.1 μL Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase High
Fidelity (Invitrogen) 5 U. μL-1, 1 μL Mg2+ and 5 μL DNA
(~10 ng. μL-1).

The PCR products were then cloned using the TOPO TA
Cloning system competent cells (Invitrogen). Transformants were screened using blue/white selection on LB-agar
containing X-Gal and 10 mg.mL-1 ampicillin or kanamycin. White or light blue colonies were picked for plasmid
isolation, reincubated overnight in LB medium containing antibiotics and plasmids were then extracted using the
Ultraclean miniplasmid extraction kit (Mo Bio, Carlsbad,
CA, USA). Plasmids were linearized using HindIII restriction enzyme and the yield quantified using Picofluor
8000-004 (Turner Designs) and samples stained with
Quant-iT PicoGreen ds DNA reagent (Molecular Probes).
Samples were thus mixed to contain a 100-fold and a
1000-fold excess of target rDNAs (krill 28SrDNA) compared with nontarget rDNAs (Pyramimonas sp.). A sample
containing only krill DNA was used as a control.
Amplification with blocking primers were performed as
25 μL reactions with 0.25 μL of each of the universal 28S
rDNA primers Short28SF(10 μM) and Short28SR(10 μM),
0.25 μL dNTP, 2.5 μL 10×, 0.1 μL Platinum Taq DNA
Polymerase High Fidelity (Invitrogen) 5 U. μL-1, 1 μL Mg2+
and a variable amount of blocking primer and rDNA. PCR
thermal cycling conditions were: 2 min at 94°C; 40 cycles
of 10 s at 94°C, 30 s at 59°C, 30 s at 68°C; and finally 5
min at 72°C.
Blocking efficiency was assessed by fragment analysis of
the fluorescently labelled PCR products. Fragment analysis separates a mixture of DNA fragments according to
their sizes and is much more sensitive than standard gel
electrophoresis. The analysis was performed on an
Applied Biosystems 3130 xl Capillary Electrophoresis
(CE) Genetic Analyser and results were analyzed with
Peak Scanner Software 1.0 (Applied Biosystems).

PCR amplification of prey DNA from krill stomachs
After determining the most efficient blocking primer mixture, PCR was performed on krill stomach isolates. PCRs
were prepared using UV sterilized equipment and consumables and negative (no-template) controls were
always run alongside the samples. The PCR reactions were
carried out on a MJ Research DNA engine Gradient Cycler
(eq. Chromo 4) and sequencing was performed on a 3730
xl DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems). PCR products
were checked by electrophoresis on a 1.3% agarose gel
stained with SYBR®Safe DNA gel stain (Invitrogen). Visible bands were cut out and purified with Bio-Rad Quantum Prep Freeze'N Squeeze DNA Gel Extraction Spin
Columns.

The PCR products were thereafter reincubated for 10 min
at 72°C with 20 μL reaction volume containing 2 μL 10×,
1 μL Mg2+, 0.2 μL Biotaq TM DNA Polymerase (Bioline)
and 0.2 μL dNTP to add 3' adenines and cloned using the
TOPO TA Cloning system competent cells (Invitrogen).
Transformants were picked for PCR and amplification was
performed with the TOPO_F and TOPO_R primers as 25
μL reactions with 0.25 μL of each oligo (10 μM), 0.25 μL
dNTP, 2.5 μL 10×, 0.1 μL Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase
High Fidelity (Invitrogen) 5 U. μL-1 and 1 μL Mg2+. PCR
thermal cycling conditions were: 2 min at 94°C; 40 cycles
of 10 s at 94°C, 30 s at 65°C, 30 s at 68°C; and finally 5
min at 72°C.
Sequences were generated from these PCR products with
the M13 forward primer and BigDye Terminator v3.1
sequencing reactions (ABI).
Amplification for sequencing of species not yet available
in GenBank were performed as 25 μL reactions with 0.25
μL of each of the universal 28S rDNA primers
Short28SseqF and Short28SseqR (10 μM) (Table 1)
designed to cover a larger area than the Short28SF/
Short28SR primers, including their primer binding sites,
0.25 μL dNTP, 2.5 μL 10×, 0.1 μL Platinum Taq DNA
Polymerase High Fidelity (Invitrogen) 5 U. μL-1 and 1 μL
Mg2+. PCR thermal cycling conditions were unmodified
except for increasing the elongation step to 60 s.
Clone identification
Clones were tentatively identified by finding their closest
match in the GenBank database using the BLASTN algorithm [43]. All the sequences (clones and closest matches)
were then aligned in MEGA 4 [44] and a similarity tree
was created using Tamura-Nei distances [45] and the minimum evolution algorithm with gap handling by pairwise
deletion.

Results
Blocking primer performance
Adding a blocking primer to the PCR mixture clearly
decreased the number of predator fragments amplified
and enriched the number of rarer prey fragments. In rDNA
mixtures containing 1000 times as many "predator"
(krill) rDNA fragments compared to "prey" (algae) rDNA
fragments, only peaks corresponding to krill rDNA could
be detected by fragment analysis when no blocking
primer was added (Table 3). Adding an annealing inhibiting blocking primer in a ratio 4:1 compared to the corresponding universal primer (1.0 μL blocking primer and
0.25 μL universal primer, both 10 μM) led to reduced
amplification of krill rDNAs but not to complete amplification arrest (Table 3). And by adding 10 times as much
blocking primer as universal primers (2.5 μL blocking
primer and 0.25 μL each universal primer), algal rDNA
was almost exclusively amplified (Table 3). Adding 20
times as much blocking primer (5.0 μL blocking primer
and 0.25 μL each universal primer) decreased the krill
peak even further (Table 3).

The "normal" primer Short28SR-blkKrill3'c3 seemed to
be somewhat more efficient in blocking predator DNA
compared to the DPO primer Short28SF-DPO-blkKrill.
Peaks corresponding to krill rDNA were lower in the 4:1

blocking primer: universal primer mixtures for both the
1:100 and the 1:1000 prey: predator rDNA samples with
the normal primer compared to the mixtures with the
DPO primer (Table 3). However, the DPO primer largely
blocked krill DNA amplification when added in a ratio of
10:1 to the unmodified primer (Table 3).
The elongation arrest primer 28S-ElArKrill-3'c3 did not
work. No PCR product at all was generated when it was
added to the PCR mixture (data not shown).
Krill stomach analysis
In total 111 clones from 13 different krill stomachs were
sequenced revealing 36 different sequences falling into 6
major groups. Among them there were no sequences corresponding to the wild type of krill 28s rDNA. 10 different
(15 in total) sequences were however clearly of krill origin
(Figure 3) and probably pseudogenes or low copy versions normally not detected by direct sequencing.

Four different groups of algal sequences were found. Two
of these groups, only detected in the March samples, had
their closest match to species belonging to Bacillariophyta, respectively the genus Phaeodactylum and the genus
Skeletonema (Figure 3). A third group, found in stomachs
from all three sampling dates seemed to be somewhat

Sequence similarity tree. Sequence similarity tree of sequences amplified from krill stomachs and related sequences. The
krill stomach sequences are named so as the first three letters means sampling date, i.e. M24 = March 24. 2007, S17 and S20 =
September 17. and September 20. 2007, St. means Stomach number and the number in parenthesis equals the number of identical sequences of each different sequence found in the different stomachs. The tree is unrooted.

similar to the Bacillariophyta, but did not match anything
in GenBank (Figure 3). The 200 bp area sequenced was
too uninformative to reveal where the group belonged by
phylogentic analysis, besides that the group most likely
was of algal origin. The last algal group was one sequence
from September belonging to Chlorophyta (Figure 3).
One large group of sequences, which was prevalent in the
September sample, could not be unequivocally identified
by reference to current sequences in GenBank. The closest
matches was a 96% match to Stauroteuthis (Mollusca). It is
possible that this may represent mollusc food items such
as larval squid. However, it is also possible that the Stauroteuthis sequence has been misreported and is actually
derived from a contaminant of the original Stauroteuthis
sample.
The sequences have been deposited to GenBank under the
accession numbers EU378965 – EU379000.

Discussion
This study shows that complete removal of predator
sequences could be achieved by adding a predator specific
blocking primer to a PCR mixture. Even though more
sophisticated sequencing techniques such as pyrosequencing [46] and polony sequencing [47] now open new
possibilities in assessing sequence diversity of mixed templates [48], applying a method that screens away templates assumed to occur in 1000-fold excess compared to
what you are looking for will certainly be beneficial. Adding a predator specific blocking primer is also a simple
method that allows for using a single PCR to simultaneously amplify DNA from all prey items present in each
stomach sample. Furthermore, it does not depend on tests
being developed a priori for potential prey, the only
sequence that is needed to be known, is the sequence of
the predator itself.
In this study we also show that a DPO primer [41] having
the 3' end blocked also could be used as a blocking
primer. This extends the region to look for species-specific
blocking sites and is very useful especially since initial trials with a krill specific 'elongation arrest' primer located
between the forward and reverse universal primer did not
work.
It is not known why the elongation arrest primer was
unsuccessful. Von Wintzingerode et al. [31] and also
Peano et al. [33] using PCR clamping and PNA probes
found that elongation arrest clamping worked, but that
competitive clamping (annealing inhibition) was more
efficient, and the former hypothesised that this was due to
interaction between the Taq polymerase and PNA and
DNA. However, since elongation arrest primers allows the
unmodified version of the universal primer to bind to the

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/5/1/12

dominating sequence, and just inhibit the generating of
its amplicons, perhaps the explanation of no PCR product
is that the universal primers never found the rarer
sequences. It is also a possibility that the 'blocking primer'
of Lewis et al. [42] is simply producing a more efficient
PCR reaction with a shorter product, rather than truly
'blocking' the amplification of the longer product.
Blocking primer performance was sensitive to the amount
of blocking primer added. We found that a 10 fold molar
excess was sufficient for complete blocking to the detection limit of our assay, when the dominant template
occurred in 1000 fold excess of the minor template. It is
difficult to compare primer concentrations between
blocking primer studies since concentration of the
unmodified primers and DNA templates also tends to
vary (like e.g. vs. reference [34]). The blocking primer in
our study was designed to be species specific. However, it
could block other species as well, something that cannot
be excluded without extensive empirical testing. Keeping
blocking primer concentration at the minimum required
amount is probably a good rule of thumb.
We only identified algal sequences in the krill stomachs
besides krill pseudogenes/low copy genes and an anonymous phylotype. Complete sequence coverage of all the
potential krill prey was not available and it was naturally
not possible to test experimentally if the blocking primers
designed to be krill specific also blocked any other organisms beside krill. However, since krill obviously could and
did feed on algae at both occasions, the DNA types
detected were probably representative snapshots of krill
diet at the three different sampling times.
Krill caught in September differed from krill caught in
March in that sequences belonging to Bacillariophyta
(diatoms) only were detected in the March samples. Further, a sequence belonging to Chlorophyta was only
found in krill caught in September. The unidentified algal
group, found in stomachs from all three sampling dates
seemed to be related to diatoms, even though it is difficult
to determine based on a 200 bp fragment. Many known
Antarctic algal groups, including the frequently dominant
group Parmales that is morphologically similar to diatoms [49], are not yet represented in sequence databases
because they are so difficult to culture. Our unidentified
algal group could belong to Parmales, or be something
else. We also found another unknown phylotype. Finding
rDNA that does not match any known sequences is common in molecular studies of eukaryotic diversity [e.g.
[19,50]]. But as barcoding initiatives results in more and
more available sequence data, especially if they could
include also other DNA regions beside mtCOI, this will be
less of a problem in the future.

The identification of several krill pseudogenes or low copy
genes is interesting. Different strategies are being developed in analyzing functional RNA genes [51]. Indicators
of pseudo-rDNA genes might for example be elevated levels of uncompensated base changes within stem regions
(see e.g. [52]). We did not perform secondary structure
predictions for the 'krill-like' sequences, and cannot tell
whether they are pseudogenes or expressed and functional
low-copy versions. 28S rDNA is expected to be very
homogenized by molecular drive [53], but there are also
reports of distinct rDNA classes within species [52,54].
Whatever is the case with the sequences detected here, the
results demonstrate that by blocking dominant sequences
from amplification, interesting variation is revealed that
might remain undetected by conventional PCR-cloning
assays.

Conclusion
DNA based techniques are valuable in tracking predatorprey interactions because they do not rely on the presence
of visually diagnostic remains. In this study we have demonstrated how blocking primers can be used to filter out
the dominating DNA from the predator itself, allowing
detection of food derived DNA fragments by the use of
universal PCR primers.
