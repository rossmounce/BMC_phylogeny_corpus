Abstract
Background: Staphylococcus aureus infection in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) is frequent and may be due to
colonization by a few pathogenic lineages. Systematic genotyping of all isolates, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus
(MSSA) as well as methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is necessary to identify such lineages and follow their
evolution in patients. Multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA/VNTR) was used to survey S.
aureus clinical isolates in a French paediatric CF centre.
Results: During a 30 months period, 108 patients, aged 2 to 21 years, regularly followed up at the centre, provided
sputum for culture. From 79 patients, a total of 278 isolates were genotyped by MLVA, resolving into 110
genotypes and 19 clonal complexes (CC) composed of similar or closely related isolates. 71% of the strains were
distributed into four main CCs, in term of number of isolates and number of genotypes. Spa (Staphylococcus
protein A) typing was performed on representative samples, showing an excellent concordance with MLVA. In 17
patients, strains from two to four different CCs were recovered over time. On six occasions, S. aureus isolates with
the same genotype were shared by 2 different patients and they belonged to one of the four main clusters.
Methicillin-resistance was observed in 60% of the isolates, 90% of which belonged to the main clonal complexes
CC8, CC45 and CC5. In 5 patients, methicillin-resistance of S. aureus isolates was not associated with the mecA
gene: for four patients, it was due to overproduction of b-lactamase, leading to BOR-SA (borderline S. aureus)
isolates, while a strain showing probably a new modified penicillin-binding capacity (MOD-SA) was observed from
one patient.
Conclusion: Systematic genotyping of S. aureus isolates recovered from sputum of CF children allows a thorough
analysis of the strains responsible for sporadic as well as chronic colonization and the follow up of their evolution
over time. We show here that more than 70% of these strains belong to 4 major CCs. MSSA as well as MRSA, BORSA and MOD-SA isolates can persist over several years, despite antibiotic treatments.

Background
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by a mutation in the
CFTR-gene leading to dysfunction of the exocrine
glands. The disease is responsible for chronic airway
obstruction in the lung, a favourable condition for pulmonary infections during childhood. In different studies

investigating pathogens in CF, S. aureus was observed in
4 to 60% of patients frequently in association with other
bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa [1-3]. Since
the introduction of methicillin in 1959, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) clones have rapidly emerged and
spread worldwide and account for 10 to 30% of S. aureus infections [4,5]. Molecular epidemiology studies
using Multi Locus Sequence Typing (MLST) on clinical
strains of S. aureus have shown that they are distributed
into 11 major clonal complexes (CC) [6]. MRSA strains

represent the most threatening challenge as they are frequently resistant to many antibiotics and there is evidence that antibiotic treatments not only facilitate the
spreading of these clones but also enhance their pathogenicity [7]. Patients with CF are at particular risk for
pulmonary colonization of MRSA, both because of their
difficulty in clearing mucus and because of their frequent hospital visits, which can increase exposure to
MRSA. Several studies reported that 20 to 35% of CF
patients harbored a MRSA strain and described the
emergence of community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA)
[8-11]. Methicillin-susceptible strains (MSSA) also constitute a risk in CF patients, particularly because of the
existence of biofilms in the infected lung in which they
can escape from antibiotic treatment [12].
The epidemiology of S. aureus in CF patients has been
investigated in different studies, but mostly MRSA were
analysed and the role of MSSA was not assessed. In
order to extend the knowledge of the population of S.
aureus chronically infecting CF patients, all the isolates
should be systematically genotyped with a high degree
of discrimination which is difficult using the currently
available techniques. The polymorphism of the Staphylococcus protein A gene (spa), first used by Frenay et al.
[13] to genotype S. aureus and further evaluated by
Shopsin et al. [14] has proven to be very useful to investigate S. aureus genetic diversity. Subsequently MLST
became the most widely used technique to analyse the
epidemiology of S. aureus and to perform phylogenetic
studies [15]. Although the combined discriminatory
power of spa typing and MLST is high, these techniques
do not sufficiently discriminate within the major CCs
and their cost is elevated. New approaches have been
developed which use Variable Number of Tandem
Repeats (VNTR) either to produce a multiple band pattern in a technique called MLVF [16,17] or to perform
Multiple loci VNTR analysis (MLVA). MLVA consists
in the analysis of individual VNTRs allowing the
description of a strain in the form of a code easily
exchangeable between laboratories [18]. MLVA with 6
VNTRs could correctly assigned isolates to outbreaks or
identified isolates as unlinked [19]. Schouls et al. using
8 VNTRs showed that MLVA was at least as discriminatory as Pulse Field Gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and twice
as discriminatory as spa-sequence typing [20]. Finally we
recently described a very informative MLVA scheme
which makes use of 14 VNTRs (MLVA-14) and demonstrated that its discriminatory power was much higher
than those of MLST and spa typing [21].
In the present work we used the proposed MLVA-14
assay to genotype S. aureus isolates recovered from
firstly as well as chronically colonized CF patients, over
a period of 30 months. The aim of our study was to
investigate the genetic diversity of MRSA and MSSA

present in the sputum of CF children whether sporadically or chronically. The longitudinal survey of genotypes provided information on the variations in those
strains recovered from some patients over a maximum
period of 24 months.

Results
Clinical characteristics of S. aureus colonization

From a total number of 143 patients attending the
Armand Trousseau CF centre during the 30 months
study period, 108 provided sputum of which 79 showed
one or several cultures positive for S. aureus. It is likely
that most were community-acquired S. aureus contaminations as the majority of patients were outpatients. In
addition there was no outbreak episode during the study
period. Although this study was not designed to correlate the bacteria recovered from the sputum with the
respiratory evolution of the patients, the following features may be underlined: Among the 79 patients, 38
were co-infected with P. aeruginosa, as observed in a
previous investigation [22], making it difficult to determine the role of S. aureus in broncho-pulmonary
exacerbations. Twenty-four of these patients harboured
MSSA, 12 patients harboured MRSA and 2 patients harboured both. MRSA were mainly isolated from older
patients who were treated by regular intravenous antibiotic courses, as recommended by the international
guidelines. In the 45 other patients, S. aureus was the
single species recovered from sputum cultures (sometimes with intermittent Haemophilus influenzae isolation); MSSA isolates were found in 34 patients, MRSA
in 6 patients and both MSSA and MRSA in 5 other
patients. These 45 patients were younger than those coinfected with P. aeruginosa. Of note, those harbouring
MRSA had more respiratory exacerbations and worse
lung function than those harbouring MSSA. Both methicillin-susceptible and methicillin resistant isolates were
repeatedly recovered over several months.
Forty percent of patients were suffering from their
first colonization with S. aureus while in 60% the recurrent isolation of the bacteria was indicative of colonization with exacerbations. In the later cases genotyping
could show in several instances that the strain was different and therefore that several independent infections
took place (see paragraph below). Patients were treated
by antimicrobial drugs, however in most cases S. aureus
was still recovered from sputum samples despite clinical
improvement.
Investigation of MRSA

In total a MRSA isolate was found at least once in 25
patients (33%) with a positive culture. Both screening
techniques used here failed to detect the presence of the
penicillin binding protein PBP 2a (mecA gene) in the
resistant strains from five patients (CFU_29, CFU_41,

CFU_48, CFU_51, CFU_68). Methicillin-resistance in
these strains (except for patient CFU_41 strain) was
caused by a high production of b-lactamase, leading to a
characteristic BOR-SA (Borderline-S. aureus) phenotype.
Isolates from patient CFU_41 did not show BOR-SA
characteristics, suggesting that methicillin resistance
resulted from a new modified penicillin-binding capacity
(MOD-SA phenotype for Modified PBP-S. aureus) [23],
though this modified capacity was not investigated. In
patients colonized by BOR-SA or MOD-SA, isolates
showing the same genotype but different susceptibility
patterns were occasionally recovered from the same sputum sample, or over time in successive samples.
The genetic diversity of strains as assessed by MLVA

A total of 278 isolates were genotyped by MLVA using
fourteen VNTRs (Table 1). Overall the PCR efficiency
was very satisfying and there was no difficulty in evaluating the amplicon size on 2% agarose gels. In one case,

the presence of several bands with Sa0122 (spa) suggested the existence of two different variants of a strain
in the sample. Indeed this could be confirmed by testing
several colonies from a culture (data not shown).
The S. aureus population diversity is shown in the
minimum spanning tree representation on Figure 1. The
presence of the 12 available sequenced genomes in the
analysis allowed the identification of several MLST CCs
(CC5 for Mu50, N315, JH1, JH9 reference strains and
25 patient strains, CC8 for COL, Newman, USA300,
NCTC8325 reference strains and 7 patient strains, CC30
for MRSA252 strain and 6 patient strains, CC1 for
MSSA476, MW2 strains and 4 patient strains). MLST
was performed on two strains (TrSa176 and TrSa246) of
the second largest cluster, showing that it belonged to
CC45 (13 patients). A comparison made with a collection of 200 strains previously analysed by MLST and by
MLVA-14 [21] confirmed the concordance of the CCs

defined by the two techniques (not shown). Therefore,
in the present study it was decided to use the MLST
nomenclature to designate the largest CCs.
To facilitate the comparison of isolates, one strain of a
given genotype per patient (117 strains and 110 genotypes) and 12 reference strains were used to perform a
clustering analysis. With a cut-off value of 45% (corresponding to a maximum of three allelic differences out
of 14 markers) 19 clusters, or clonal complexes (CC),
were observed. Figure 2 shows the first part of a dendrogram in which all the strains belonging to CC30,
CC8, CC1, CC7, CC15 and CC22 fall. The second part
of the dendrogram shown on figure 3 displays all the

CC45, CC51 and CC5 isolates. Four CCs comprised
71% (in term of number of isolates and number of genotypes) of the strains (CC5 35%, CC8 11%, CC30 8%,
CC45 17%). Five clusters contained only one genotype
each. MRSA were distributed into 36 genotypes, MSSA
into 81 genotypes whereas 3 genotypes were assigned to
both MRSA and MSSA strains.
Spa typing

The spa repeats were sequenced in 61 selected isolates
on the basis of their distribution into the different clusters and of their polymorphism within these clusters.
The sequence was submitted to the Ridom Spaserver in
order to identify the spa type. Seven new spa types were

given a number by the Ridom Spaserver. The result confirmed the correct clustering of strains by MLVA, as
shown by the almost perfect correlation between the
two genotyping techniques (Figures 2 and 3). Strain
TrSa109 was positioned near CC30 strains and its spa
type was characteristic of ST34 strains (CC30 members)
a bacterial population resulting from a large chromosomal rearrangement between CC30 and CC8 [24]. Three
identical isolates from patient CFU_79 which spa type
corresponded to CC8 were branched in an ancestral
position to the CC8 cluster.
Interestingly, in CC45 a larger diversity was observed
for spa (10 alleles from 2 to 14 repeats), as compared to
the other large clusters, CC5 (5 alleles) and CC8 (2
alleles).
Longitudinal survey

In 62 patients (80%), isolates that were repeatedly recovered over the 30 months study period belonged to the
same lineage, i.e. they were either identical or differed at
only one VNTR. In the other patients the isolates
belonged to 2, 3 or even 4 different CCs. For example
isolates belonging to 4 different CCs were found in
patient CFU_64 and only one of them was observed
more than once. Table 2 shows the number of CCs and
genotypes from patients for which at least 4 isolates
were recovered. One example of stability is observed in
patient CFU_41 for which 16 MOD-SA CC5 isolates
with the same genotype were recovered from January
2006 to July 2008. Patient CFU_40 had 9 isolates with
two different spa alleles. In 2006 and early 2007, a single
genotype with seven repeats at the spa locus was
observed, whereas after March 2007, isolates with two
repeats at the spa locus were also found. On several
occasions, both were present in equal amounts giving
rise to two products upon PCR amplification (data not
shown). From March 2006 to January 2008, 16 CC5 isolates were recovered from patient CFU_48, with three
variants differing at VNTRs Sa1213 and Sa1132: one
genotype was found in 7 isolates in 2006 and early 2007,
another one in 8 isolates from 2006 to 2008 and the
third corresponded to a single isolate in 2007. Patient
CFU_96 had 14 isolates with three variants differing at
VNTR Sa1132: one was found only in 2006 in two isolates, a second one was found once in 2006, 6 times in
2007 and once in 2008, and the third one was found
twice in 2007. Patient CFU_34 had 7 isolates with two
variants differing at VNTR Sa2039: one genotype was
observed in 2006 in two isolates, and the other was
found in five isolates once in 2006 and in 2007.
Genotypes and MRSA

On figures 2 and 3 are shown the sensitivity to methicillin and the presence/absence of the mecA gene carried
by staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec),
as tested by PCR. The large majority of MRSA isolates

Page 7 of 12

fall inside CC8, CC45 and CC5. In CC30, all strains
were MSSA except for TrSa109 which is placed outside
of the cluster and is mecA negative. Interestingly, in
patient CFU_51, 10 isolates were of the same genotype,
of which 6 were mecA positive and 4 were mecA negative, suggesting a recent transfer of the mecA gene or
SCCmec instability in this particular strain. In five
patients, isolates with identical genotypes were apparently either resistant or sensitive to methicillin but
mecA was not detected while the phenotypic resistance
aspects were BOR-SA or MOD-SA. In four patients
only MSSA strains were isolated over more than 12
months (for example, in patient CFU_59 the same
MSSA strain was isolated 7 times over 18 months).
The genetic diversity among MSSA isolates was larger
than among MRSA, but both could be found in large
CCs.

Discussion
Mlva

The MLVA procedure used in the present study allowed
the systematic investigation of all S. aureus isolates
recovered from CF patients attending a French centre
during a period of 30 months. In the present study a
total of 278 isolates from 79 children were genotyped,
with a great variation within the number of S. aureus
isolates per patient: one or two isolates for the firstly
colonized patients (the youngest children), to more than
15 isolates for some chronically colonized patients
repeatedly hospitalized for acute exacerbation. This type
of study had never been conducted before because the
available techniques were either time consuming or too
expensive. Generally only MRSA isolates were studied
and consequently, the MSSA diversity was insufficiently
known although they account for a large proportion of
strains responsible for chronic colonization in CF
patients.
MLVA using 14 VNTRs is a very informative technique
which compares favourably with MLST and spa typing.
More genotypes are observed and it is possible to see the
emergence of variants. The size of the VNTRs repeats
ranges from 24 bp (the spa VNTR Sa0122) to 159 bp,
which makes the technique very easy to implement using
agarose gel electrophoresis as well as high throughput
approaches. The allelic size differences for such markers
can be estimated directly by eye and compared to a chart
where all the known alleles have been indicated. This
information is accessible on a dedicated web page in
“The bacterial MLVA-genotyping-on-the-Web service”
(http://mlva.u-psud.fr/; Staphylococcus aureus2009 database or a more recent update). For epidemiology purposes, a simpler scheme could be performed with a
selection of 10 informative markers (MLVA-10). However, it is important to keep a large collection of markers

with different degrees of variability for the investigation
of outbreaks or for phylogenetic studies. In the present
work each VNTR was amplified in a separate PCR reaction but our preliminary experiments showed that 6
VNTRs could be amplified simultaneously and the size
automatically determined using a capillary electrophoresis apparatus [21]. This opens the way to automatized
genotyping similarly to the protocol described by Schouls
et al. [20]. However in this latest study only 8 VNTRs
(MLVA-8) were analysed which, in our opinion may not
be sufficiently discriminant for epidemiological studies.
Indeed the Simpson’s diversity index (DI) in the MLVA-8
assay was 98.5% whereas we obtained a 99.65% DI using
the MLVA-14 assay. Other published VNTR-based genotyping methods either did not use enough markers or
analyzed fingerprints which makes the comparison of
profiles between laboratories very difficult [16]. In addition failure to amplify some VNTRs in a relatively important number of samples led to partial profiles in up to
27% of isolates in one study [19].
Genetic diversity of strains and population structure

In the present collection of isolates, 110 genotypes were
observed (not including the reference strains), 68%
belonging to 4 main clusters. The genotypes in the
MLVA cluster corresponding to CC8 were very stable

over a period of more than 2 years. In contrast, more
variability was observed in isolates of CC5 and CC45. In
CC45, several VNTRs showed very small alleles as compared to the other clonal complexes which could be the
result of frequent loss of repeats due to recombination.
The majority of CC8 isolates were MRSA, whereas
these represented about 50% of CC5 and CC45 isolates.
Recent studies have shown that CC8 contained both
community and hospital-acquired MRSA strains
whereas the other CCs mainly contained hospitalacquired strains [8,11,25]. In a recent survey of CF
patients in Spain, 67% of MRSA isolates were ST228
which belong to CC5, and the second largest group corresponded to ST247 belonging to CC8 [26].
Colonization

The precise identification of S. aureus genotypes colonizing the lungs of CF patients is of importance to trace
the source of contamination and eventually modify the
management of patients in the hospital. It is also important to know whether a single strain is present over
time despite antibiotic treatment, or if different strains
are involved in patients exacerbations. In two patients,
isolates belonging to four different CCs were observed,
but the most frequent situation was colonization by a
single strain which could vary over time.

Vu-Thien et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:24
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/24

In some patients, the same strain was recovered over a
two years period, with a few variants differing at a single
VNTR. In several cases the variants seemed to appear
sequentially suggesting that they acquired an advantage
over the first isolate. On the contrary, in patient
CFU_48, two variants were alternatively isolated during
the two years period, and in patient CFU_40, the presence of two spa amplicons in a single PCR reaction
pointed to the coexistence in equal amounts of two variants in the sputum sample. Interestingly variants were
more frequently observed in CC45 strains than in other
CCs, again indicating the existence of a higher degree of
instability in this CC. It was shown that the adaptation
to chronic colonization requires the expression of virulence factors and a higher mutation capacity resulting in
an increase of the genetic diversity [27].
In 6 cases, a given genotype was shared by different
patients, but it is difficult to define the origin of the
contamination as most of these strains belonged to
common CCs. Indeed, in a recent study by Sakwinska et
al., it was shown that CC45 and CC30 colonized each
24% of the carrier population [28]. In the Armand
Trousseau center, the risk of P. aeruginosa cross-colonization has led to the increased use of isolation protocols
among the patients since many years. The source of S.
aureus lung colonization could be either the nose, or
the oro-pharynx, as suggested by recent studies [29,30].
The simplicity of MLVA genotyping should allow a systematic analysis of the first oro-pharyngal or nasal isolates of young CF patients and those chronically found
in purulent sputum, as this may contribute to an early
diagnosis of S. aureus infection. However searching for
potential sources of S. aureus from the patients and
their family members, the medical staff, the environmental home and hospital setting requires a laborious
sampling work and needs another study.
Thirty eight patients were also colonized by P. aeruginosa as observed in a previous investigation [22]. There
was apparently no link between the S. aureus genotype
and the presence of P. aeruginosa. However, the patients
from whom we analyzed a large number of S. aureus
isolates, reflecting a long-term colonization, were usually
coinfected with P. aeruginosa, with the exception of
patient CFU_96 (14 isolates).
In a few patients, chronic colonization by a single
strain was not observed although strains from up to 4
different CCs could be isolated during the study period.
Antibiotic resistance

MRSA were found in more than 30% of patients, while
some of them also carried MSSA. The presence of
MRSA can limit the inscription of a patient on a lung
transplant list [31], therefore, it is important to investigate the status and mechanisms of methicillin resistance.
In some MRSA strains methicillin resistance was not

Page 9 of 12

associated with presence of mecA [32] and the resistance phenotype for most of these strains was BOR-SA,
with overproduction of b-lactamase. Vancomycin was
frequently used to treat MRSA infection, though pulmonary diffusion of this drug was not excellent. Eradication of S. aureus was rarely observed and chronic
colonization was confirmed from repetitive sputum samples over time.

Conclusion
In the present study, using the MLVA-14 procedure, we
genotyped rapidly and with a simple equipment a large
number of S. aureus isolates, allowing the longitudinal
survey of 79 CF patients. A large proportion of isolates
belonged to a limited number of CCs, and in most cases
a single strain, either a MRSA or a MSSA, chronically
colonized the patient. Over time variants appeared and
it will be interesting to test whether they show selective
advantages. The performances of MLVA open the way
to additional studies to investigate the contamination
sources and to identify S. aureus isolates responsible for
colonization and clinical exacerbations.
Methods
Patients and bacterial strains

The criteria for diagnosis of CF was either the presence
of 2 mutations in the cftr gene, or one or no mutation
of cftr associated with a positive sweat test defined by a
chloride (Cl-) ion concentration above 60 mmol/l. Sputum samples were collected from the lower airways,
during an outpatient visit or hospitalization. For each
patient an isolate was analysed with at least a onemonth interval between two samples. A total of 278 isolates were genotyped from 79 patients (2 to 21 years
old) attending the CF centre during the course of this
study (January 2006 to June 2008). Patients were named
CFU_ (for cystic fibrosis unit) as reported in a previous
study on P. aeruginosa infection [22] and clinical isolates
were named TrSa. The MLVA genotypes of the reference strains N315, USA300, MSSA 476, RF122, COL,
NCTC8325, MRSA252, Mu50, MW2, JH1, JH9 and
Newman were deduced from their genomic sequence by
taking advantage of the tools available at http://minisatellites.u-psud.fr/. As a control for VNTR amplification,
we used Mu50, an MRSA strain which genome has
been sequenced [33]. The present project is in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration (Ethical Principles
for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects).
Strains were collected from sputum specimen as part of
the patients’ usual care, without any additional sampling.
All patient data shown in the present work were anonymously reported, without offering any possibility to
trace the actual patients. The “Comité Consultatif pour
la Protection des Personnes dans la Recherche

Biomédicale (CCPPRB) Ile-De-France - Paris - Saint
Antoine” was consulted on April 4th 2006 and allowed
the exemption of patient’s written informed consent.
Microbiology

Sputum samples were inoculated onto sheep blood, chocolate and salt mannitol agar (bioMérieux, France).
After 2 days of incubation at 35°C, non identical-looking
colonies were picked and tested for Gram stain and catalase reaction. Identification of S. aureus species was
confirmed with the Pastorex Staph-Plus® slide test (BioRad, France), and antimicrobial susceptibility performed
by disk diffusion. Methicillin (oxacillin) resistance was
screened with the cefoxitin disk diffusion method, and
the PBP 2a was detected with the MRSA-screen latex
agglutination test (Denka, Seiken Co, Ltd, Japan) [34].
For MRSA isolates showing a negative PBP 2a agglutination test, overproduction of b-lactamase was screened
looking for irregular aspect of the inhibition zone
around the oxacillin disk, combined with a synergistic
aspect between the inhibition zones of oxacillin and
amoxicillin+clavulanate disks. The isolates with overproduction of b-lactamase are named BOR-SA (borderline
S. aureus). In addition, detection of PBP 2a was performed in every MSSA isolates recovered from patients
known to be previously colonized with MRSA.
mecA gene detection

The presence of the mecA gene was searched by PCR
amplification in all the isolates. Primers MecA_F,
AAAATCGATGGTAAAGGTTGGC and MecA_R,
AGTTCTGCAGTACCGGATTTGC were as described
by Murakami et al. [35].
DNA purification

About 20 colonies from a subculture on solid media
were dissociated in 180 μl TE buffer (Tris 10 mM,
EDTA 1 mM pH8). Then 20 μl of Lysostaphin (AMBICIN® L, AMBI PRODUCTS LLC, Lawrence, USA) at a
concentration of 1 mg/ml was added, the mixture was
vortexed and incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C. One μl
of Proteinase K (20 mg/ml) and 200 μl 2 × lysis Buffer
(1% de SDS, 20 mM Nacl, 20 mM Tris pH8, 20 mM
EDTA) were added, and the samples were incubated 30
minutes at 50°C. DNA was purified using phenol extraction and precipitation with ethanol. The quality and
concentration of DNA was measured using a ND-1000
Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop®, Labtech, Palaiseau,
France). The DNA was diluted at 1 ng/μl in water for
the PCR amplification reaction.
Genotyping

The MLVA-14 scheme is described in detail elsewhere
[21], as well as its performance as compared to MLST
and spa typing. In brief, it consists in the individual analysis of 14 VNTRs, five of which are located inside open
reading frames (spa, coa, SIRU15, SAV1078, SAV 1738),
six are in STAR elements and three are intergenic.

Page 10 of 12

Oligonucleotide primers targeting the 5’ and 3’ flanking
regions of VNTR loci were used for amplification (Table
1). The following conditions were used: PCR reactions
were performed in 15 μl containing 2 ng DNA, 1 × PCR
Reaction Buffer, 1.5 mM MgCl2 , 1 Unit of Taq DNA
polymerase (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France), 200 μM of
each dNTP, 0.3 μM of each flanking primer (Eurogentec, Angers, France). Amplification was performed with
a PTC 200 thermocycler (Biorad, Marnes-la-Coquette,
France) using the following conditions: initial denaturation cycle for 5 min at 94°C, 35 cycles of denaturation
for 30 s at 94°C, annealing for 30 s at 58°C and elongation for 45 s at 72°C plus a final elongation step for 10
min at 72°C. For the analysis of all markers, 3 μl of PCR
products were separated in a 2% agarose gel using agarose for routine use (Eurogentec, Angers, France). Electrophoresis was performed in 20 cm-wide gels made in
0.5 × TBE buffer (Sigma), run at 8 V/cm. For each PCR
run the reference strain Mu50 was included. The 100bp ladder DNA size marker was from MBI Fermentas
(Euromedex, Souffelweyersheim, France). The gels were
stained after the run in 0.5-1.0 g/ml ethidium bromide
for 15 to 30 min, then rinsed with water and photographed under ultraviolet illumination (Vilber-Lourmat,
Marne la Vallée, France). The amplicon size was determined using the dedicated tool Gelcompar in the BioNumerics software (Applied Math, Sint-Martens-Latem,
Belgium).
The MLVA genotype of an isolate with 14 VNTRs
(MLVA-14) is expressed as its allelic profile corresponding to the number of repeats at each VNTR in the order
Sa0122 (alias spa), Sa0266 (alias coa), Sa0311, Sa0704,
Sa1132, Sa1194, Sa1291 (alias SIRU13), Sa1729, Sa1866,
Sa2039, Sa0906, Sa1213, Sa1425 and Sa1756 (alias
SIRU15). The genotype of the Mu50 strain deduced
from its genomic sequence is 10 6 3 4 6 7 4 5 3 3 3 5 4
1. Clustering analyses were performed using the categorical coefficient (also called Hamming’s distance) and
UPGMA. A cut off value of 45% was previously shown
[21] to define clusters which correspond to MLST clonal
complexes and is therefore used in this study to identify
CCs. The isolates in these CCs differ at a maximum of
three VNTRs out of 14. Lineages are arbitrarily defined
as groups of isolates for which the genotype between
two isolates differs at a maximum of 2 VNTRs (cut-off
80%). The minimum spanning tree was produced in
BioNumerics, scaling with member count. The polymorphism index of individual or combined VNTR loci
was calculated using the Hunter-Gaston diversity index
(HGDI) [36], an application of the Simpson’ s index of
diversity [37] is 0.9965 [21].
Spa typing

The spa tandem repeat was amplified using the primers
for Sa0122, and the amplicons were purified by

Vu-Thien et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:24
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/24

polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation and sequenced
(MWG Biotech). The repeat nomenclature was that of
[14], and spa type were obtained from the spa typing
website http://www.spaserver.ridom.de/ developed by
Ridom GmbH and curated by SeqNet.org http://www.
SeqNet.org/ [38]. The spa types were correlated to the
MLST CCs according to the SpaServer.
MLST typing

The primers and condition used for PCR were found on
the mlst.net at http://saureus.mlst.net/.
