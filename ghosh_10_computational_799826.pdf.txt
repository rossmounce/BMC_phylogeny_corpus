Computational analysis and determination of a
highly conserved surface exposed segment in
H5N1 avian flu and H1N1 swine flu
neuraminidase
Ambarnil Ghosh1*, Ashesh Nandy2,3, Papiya Nandy1

Abstract
Background: Catalytic activity of influenza neuraminidase (NA) facilitates elution of progeny virions from infected
cells and prevents their self-aggregation mediated by the catalytic site located in the body region. Research on the
active site of the molecule has led to development of effective inhibitors like oseltamivir, zanamivir etc, but the
high rate of mutation and interspecies reassortment in viral sequences and the recent reports of oseltamivir
resistant strains underlines the importance of determining additional target sites for developing future antiviral
compounds. In a recent computational study of 173 H5N1 NA gene sequences we had identified a 50-base highly
conserved region in 3’-terminal end of the NA gene.
Results: We extend the graphical and numerical analyses to a larger number of H5N1 NA sequences (514) and
H1N1 swine flu sequences (425) accessed from GenBank. We use a 2D graphical representation model for the gene
sequences and a Graphical Sliding Window Method (GSWM) for protein sequences scanning the sequences as a
block of 16 amino acids at a time. Using a protein sequence descriptor defined in our model, the protein sliding
scan method allowed us to compare the different strains for block level variability, which showed significant
statistical correlation to average solvent accessibility of the residue blocks; single amino acid position variability
results in no correlation, indicating the impact of stretch variability in chemical environment. Close to the Cterminal end the GSWM showed less descriptor-variability with increased average solvent accessibility (ASA) that is
also supported by conserved predicted secondary structure of 3’ terminal RNA and visual evidence from 3D
crystallographic structure.
Conclusion: The identified terminal segment, strongly conserved in both RNA and protein sequences, is especially
significant as it is surface exposed and structural chemistry reveals the probable role of this stretch in tetrameric
stabilization. It could also participate in other biological processes associated with conserved surface residues. A
RNA double hairpin secondary structure found in this segment in a majority of the H5N1 strains also supports this
observation. In this paper we propose this conserved region as a probable site for designing inhibitors for broadspectrum pandemic control of flu viruses with similar NA structure.

Background
A pandemic occurs when a new viral strain appears,
against which the human population has no immunity,
resulting in epidemics worldwide with high mortality
and morbidity. It is estimated that the influenza
pandemic that started with the 1918 Spanish flu killed

~20 to 50 million people worldwide [1], followed by epidemics of Asian flu in 1957, Hong Kong flu in 1968 and
Russian flu in 1977, each with random severe attacks on
human populations [2]. A recent strain of influenza, the
highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1, and its
variants have been in circulation since the first major
outbreak in 1997 among birds in South East Asia leading to 141 human deaths [3]. High mutation rate and
wide variety of birds and mammals including human

hosts are probable reasons of pandemic-causing ability
of the virus. Previous studies on the pathogenicity of
influenza virus have reported the role of different kinds
of genetic events like antigenic shift, antigenic drift,
recombination and reassortment as major reasons for
the emergence of virulent strains [4-10]. The very recent
outbreak of swine influenza (H1N1) in Mexico in April/
May 2009 has already prompted the WHO raise an
alarm at the situation by raising the level of influenza
pandemic alert to phase 6 [11]; the H1N1 swine flu is
believed to be a product of reassortment between genes
in the avian, human and swine influenza strains which
has exhibited capability for human to human transmission and resulted in at least 8768 human deaths worldwide at last count [11].
According to the latest WHO report (from 2003 to 27th
November 2009), 262 out of 444 H5N1 flu infected
human patients have died [12]. Although there is no confirmed evidence of human to human transmission, WHO
still considers the H5N1 to be a potential pandemic
threat [12]. The only known and effective inhibitors
developed to date to control the spread of this virus are
targeted against either the M protein (amantadine,
rimantadine) or NA (oseltamivir (marketed as Tamiflu),
zanamivir (marketed as Relenza)). Amantadine and
rimantadine resistance has developed in almost all circulating influenza strains [13] and therefore only oseltamivir and zanamivir are currently being stockpiled as
precaution against any pandemic [12]. However, though
these drugs are effective against the NA active site, recent
strains from localized areas [Northern Hemisphere
(2007-08 season), Southern Hemisphere (2008 season)
and finally 100% resistant in United States (2009 pandemic strains)] have developed resistance against oseltamivir [14]. Oseltamivir treatment showed resistance in
up to 2% patients in clinical trials and 18% of treated
children including frequent resistance acquisition in case
of children only [15,16]. A few Tamiflu resistant cases
were also reported in laboratory experiments [14,17],
where the mutation of H274Y is believed to be partly
responsible [18]. Additionally, in case of zanamivir, markedly reduced effectiveness (2.3% of collected sample) was
observed in influenza-A (H1N1) viruses isolated between
2006 to early 2008 from Australia & Southeast Asia containing previously undescribed Q136K NA mutation [19].
Thus, the high rate of mutation in the viral sequences
has always posed a risk of rapid development of resistance against current inhibitors and vaccines. Detection
of any strongly conserved region within the overall mutational scenario remains therefore an important point of
focus for designing effective remedies covering broad
spectrum antiviral activity.
In a previous analysis [20] using graphical representation methods, we had reported a specific stretch in the

Page 2 of 10

3’ C-terminal end of the RNA sequence that seemed to
be well conserved. Graphical representation techniques
were developed by Hamori and Ruskin [21], Gates [22],
Nandy [23] and Leong and Morgenthaler [24], among
others [25] and have been applied to a wide variety of
problems highlighting their usefulness. Liao et al [26]
have shown that such techniques can be used to analyse
the SARS corona virus, and, separately [27], to generate
phylogenetic trees without any need for multiple alignments, Larionov et. al. [28] have shown that plots of
human and mouse chromosomal sequences in a graphical representation were able to reveal long range palindromes. Randic, Humberto Gonzales-Diaz and several
other authors have extended these techniques to protein
sequence analysis and obtained many useful results.
Parameters like numerical indices, topological indices
are the recent outcome of these techniques applied to
proteins, viral surfaces, RNA secondary structures and
small molecules [29-34] have extended the scope to
consider more general biological applications. In particular, González-Díaz et al. extended these representations to the study of protein sequences [35] and Mass
Spectra outcomes of proteins and/or protein serum profiles in parasites [36], Toxicoproteomics and diagnosis
of Cancer patients [37,38]. Also, these descriptors can
be used in QSAR studies of biological entity in molecular level. These QSAR connect structural information
with the biological function of a molecular entity under
study and may be used to predict unknown entries.
Structure here refers not only to drug structure but also
to DNA sequence, RNA sequence or secondary structure, and protein sequences or 3D structure [38]. Analyses based on graphical representation techniques have
thus become acceptable for many purposes [39].
In this study we have used the 2D graphical representation model for gene sequences [23] and a 20D graphical representation method for proteins [40] to analyze a
database consisting of 514 NA sequences of H5N1 and
425 sequences of the H1N1 influenza subtypes. In the
protein algorithm we modelled a protein sequence in
the abstract using a 20-dimensional Cartesian coordinate
system to generate sequence descriptors. While we lose
the benefits of visual recognition, our method allows
easy mathematical closure and comparison of characteristic numbers to determine the degree of relatedness of
or patterns in different sequences and peptide stretches.
Furthermore, numerical characterisation techniques
based on graphical representations have enabled quantitative estimation of sequence similarities and dissimilarities [25]. Basically there are two approaches for
numerical characterization, both of which use the graphical representation to map a DNA sequence into a set
of numbers. One approach using geometrical mapping
proposed by Raychaudhury and Nandy [41] have been

Ghosh et al. BMC Structural Biology 2010, 10:6
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/10/6

found to be useful for several calculations based on the
2D graphical representation [25], and extended recently
to an abstract 20D modelling for protein sequences [40],
where individual sequences are indexed by numerical
descriptors. The other approach is to use matrix methods by forming ratios of graph theoretic and Euclidean
distances between nodes of the graphical plots, first formulated for DNA sequences in Randic et al [42]. Since
invariants associated with matrix formulation are wellknown, individual sequences can be indexed by one or
more such invariants of various orders; it is expected
that these would be sufficiently characteristic of the
underlying sequences to enable unique characterization.
This technique has been the most widely used method
of choice for the researchers in this field who have
defined different types of matrices to construct various
invariants to describe the DNA sequences. However, the
difficulties associated with computing various parameters for very large matrices that are natural for large
sequences have restricted the numerical characterizations to leading eigenvalues and the like [25].
In the current work with emphasis on the protein
sequence, the body region of the NA was considered for
deeper analysis due to its role in docking and its large surface exposed segments along with considerable variability
throughout the sequence. The body segment also holds
the active site where sialidase activity takes place, while
the C-terminal end of a membrane protein is also very
important since it’s generally responsible for holding information of protein transport [43], folding stabilization [44],
cell to cell migration specificity [45] and others. One
related example is the C-terminal of ryanodine receptor
(RyR) channel: The 100 amino acids situated at C-terminal
of RyR, referred to as the C-terminal tail, is a highly conserved sequence throughout RyR isoforms and which has
been implicated in channel function where deletion of
final 15 residues results in an inactive channel [46]. Additionally Goto et al. [47] have shown the importance of carboxy-terminal lysine (position 453) of NA in plasminogen
mediated hemagglutinin cleavage. Li et al has shown from
the DNA sequences that truncation of 66 nucleotides at
the 3’-terminal (or C-terminal 22 amino acids) of the NA
leads to loss of antigenicity against influenza virus in
BALB/c mice [48], indicating a crucial role of that region
as a potent antigen. Additionally, we have modelled the
RNA secondary structure of this region and determined
that a double loop hairpin formation exists in a majority
of the sequences. All these evidences support the importance of C-terminal region as a functional and antigenically important portion for the NA proteins.

Methods
We selected the complete cds of the H5N1 NA gene
sequences for the period 1997 to 2007, totalling to 514

Page 3 of 10

samples, available in the GenBank DNA database [as on
March 10, 2008]. They comprised 35 sequences with
1410 bases (469 translated aa), 8 sequences with 1353
bases (450 aa) and 471 sequences of 1350 bases (449
aa). Of the total 471 strains of the 1350 base NAs that
are more widely prevalent now, 371 strains were from
avian, 96 were from human isolates and 4 from other
organisms. The 1410 base NAs comprised of a single
human isolate and the rest are avian; there were no
human isolates having 1353 nucleotides. To complement
the study of H5N1 we also selected 425 complete cds’s
of the H1N1 swine flu NA sequences deposited in the
GenBank [up to 23rd July 2009].
Graphical representation method for nucleic acids

In the Nandy 2D graphical representation method [23] a
nucleotide sequence is plotted on a 2D Cartesian axes
system as follows: Move one step in the negative xdirection for an adenine (a) in the sequence, one step in
the positive y-direction for a cytosine (c), one step in
the positive x-direction for a guanine (g) or one step in
the negative y-direction for a thymine (t) to plot a point.
Start from this point and do the same exercise for the
next base in the sequence and so on, which ultimately
generates a graph of the sequence as a series of points
on the plot essentially representing the composition and
distribution of bases in the sequence.
To make quantitative comparisons between different
sequences plotted in this system, we follow the method
given in Raychaudhry and Nandy [41]. The weighted
centre of mass of each graph is calculated by summing
the co-ordinate values of each point and then a graph
radius, gR, is computed. The gR represents the Base Distribution index or numerical descriptor for nucleic
acids. The gR is a very sensitive measure of the sequence
composition and distribution [41,49], the values depending on the type of mutations and where in the sequence
they occur. gR is especially useful in comparing equal
length sequences [50].
Graphical representation of proteins

To characterize protein sequences graphically, we use a
recently proposed novel method where we model a protein sequence in the abstract using a 20-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system which has been shown to be a
useful technique for sequence comparisons and phylogenetic studies [40]. In this method we associate each
amino acid with one axis of a 20D Cartesian coordinate
system; the choice of association is equivalent for all residues, but once assigned will be fixed for the duration of
the computation. For easy computation and comparison
we have calculated weighted averages and resultant vectors that are unique to the respective sequences as in the
case of the nucleotide sequence representations [40].

Ghosh et al. BMC Structural Biology 2010, 10:6
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/10/6

Here this technique is used to compute the protein
descriptors to determine similarity/dissimilarity between
different protein sequences including short protein
stretches. To avoid error of false similarity when analysing short sequences, we have added a stretch of 20 aa
peptides at the beginning of each sequence for filling up
all the initial coordinates with the value 1 before starting
the calculation of protein descriptors, a technique that is
useful for comparative studies.
RNA Secondary Structure Prediction Method

To predict RNA secondary structure from the conserved
3’-terminal RNA sequence we have used the mfold RNA
secondary structure prediction server (version 3.2) [51]
of Zuker and Turner [52,53] (Figure 1).
Graphical Sliding Window Method (GSWM)

To determine the relative degree of variability of this Cterminal 16 aa stretch, we subjected the entire body
region to a scan of 16 aa stretches by sliding a 16 aa
wide window residue by residue on the 20D graph and
calculating the protein descriptor pR at each point for
all 514 H5N1 protein sequences. From this dataset we
determined how many pR’s were different; the lower the
number the lower the variability of the stretch. We also
determined the solvent accessibility at each point by
using the SABLE solvent accessibility prediction server
on the Internet [54]. The results of this Graphical Sliding Window Method (GSWM) were then compared
(Figure 2) with the 16-residue moving average solvent
accessibility data to determine correlations, if any, and
conserved regions with considerable solvent accessibility.
The choice of the 16 aa block of residues for this
exercise was dictated by, initially, the observation of the
50-base conserved nucleotide stretch at the C-terminal
end of the gene sequence, and further supported by the
following: (a) We started with a 8-residue block since
this is the consensus minimum number for identifying a
protein from a single block and performed a GSWM
analysis. This was then extended to 12-residue, 16-residue and 24-residue blocks, based on which the 16-residue block was found to yield optimum results. (b) A
second consideration was that while a short aa segment
may show a high probability of being solvent exposed, a
comparatively large segment will have considerable portions embedded in the protein. (c) A large segment will
have considerable variability in the amino acid composition. Indeed, based on these considerations, the GSWM
identified the 16 aa segment as the optimum and this
can be seen in the figures (Figure 3) and the accompanying animated sequence [Additional file 1] where it
will be observed that all but one of the six 16-aa blocks
show only portions as surface exposed.

Average Relative Solvent Accessibility prediction

To analyze solvent accessibility we have used SABLE
secondary structure prediction server [54]. Body regions
of twenty proteins were submitted to calculate relative
solvent accessibility.
3D structure Visualization

To visualize the protein structural residues and their
chemical environment we had used the crystallographic
structure from PDB database submitted by Russell et al.
[55] and the molecular visualization tool PyMOL [56].

Results and Discussion
To determine a potentially conserved region in the
H5N1 avian flu and H1N1 swine flu NA gene and protein sequences we proceeded initially from the 2D graphical representations of the various strains of the
H5N1 and H1N1 NA which sequence segment seemed
to be most strongly conserved, followed by confirmation
by the RNA and protein descriptors. Next, we did a sliding window analysis along the NA body region to determine whether any other segment had comparable
characteristics. Finally, we did a solvent accessibility analysis of the protein. From correlation of the results
obtained from solvent accessibility analysis and sliding
window method we could determine that the terminal
segment was the best surface exposed conserved 16
amino acids long stretch which may be involved in significant biological functions; this is especially significant
in view of the observation that truncation of the last 22
aa leads to loss of biological function of NA [48]. We
followed this up with a detailed study of the crystallographic features to observe that indeed this segment of
the NA protein is important for its stability.
Our earlier work with the 2D graphical representation
of 173 RNA sequences of the H5N1 NA had identified a
50-base segment at the 3’ end of the sequence as being
well conserved. NCBI-BLAST analysis had confirmed
that this indeed was strongly conserved not only among
the H5N1 NA but also among the NAs of influenza A
subtypes H1N1, H3N1, H4N1, H6N1, H7N1, H9N1,
H10N1, H11N1, and H12N1 [20]. In the current
extended database of 514 H5N1 strains also we found
from the graph radius descriptor gR that only 25 strains
of the 50-base segment had any differences in the bases,
i.e. 489 strains (95.14%) had this segment identical to
one or the other of the 25 strains out of the 514 samples. Further, extension of the same study to samples
from all nine antigenic subtypes (N1 to N9) showed
considerable conserved characteristics for this protein
region. A multiple alignment analysis (Table 1) of the
last 20 amino acid residues (4 more residues are taken
to facilitate the alignment process) of each subtype

results in at least 8 well conserved column positions
indicating the importance of the finding.
In comparison, in the transmembrane and stalk regions
the percentage of variants, i.e. non-identical sequences,
among the 514 H5N1 strains are 24.71% and 33.85%,
respectively; the complete body region, i.e. from the end
of the stalk to the end of the sequence, shows 75.5% variants, very high compared to the 4.86% of the 50-base 3’terminal region. As can be expected, a large number of
the mutations responsible for the RNA sequence variations in this 50-base region are synonymous. A parallel
study using the protein graphical representation and the
protein graph radius descriptor, pR, shows that the number and percentage of variants of the corresponding protein sequence are 10% and 1.95%, respectively.
We also analyzed the 425 strains of the H1N1 swine
flu NA sequences to determine the degree of conservation in the 50-base segment at the 3’-end of the gene
sequences and the 16 aa segment at the C-terminal end
of the protein sequences. While the gene sequences are
found to have mutated considerably compared to the
earlier H1N1 and H5N1 strains, the mutations are all
synonymous and the protein sequences are all identical
with one another and to one of the dominant strains in
the H5N1 sequences.
Consequent to these observations regarding the stability of this segment, we considered their predicted secondary structures. Terminal structures of viral RNAs are
found frequently to be involved in host dependent cellular processes including replication, transcription, viral
particle packaging, by forming secondary structures like
hairpin, double-hairpin, pan-handle etc [57-59]. Numerical characterization of the 514 NA RNA database have
already summarized the database to 25 strains generating 25 unique numbers each representing unique structure of the 50 base RNA segment. Using these strains in
RNA secondary structure prediction through mfold have
yielded a double hairpin structure (Figure 1) in 21 cases
with acceptable ΔG values showing strong stability

characteristics. This kind of double hairpin structures
are found to contribute in some biological functions like
V(D)J recombination [60], RNA editing [61] and viral
RNA encapsidation [62]. This prediction for the RNA
segment in H5N1 not only supports the observation of
stability of this C-terminal region, but also designates
the importance of that region in viral cell biology at
RNA level.
To determine whether the translation product of such
a segment is unique in the H5N1 NA, we obtained the
protein graph descriptor of an equivalent size moving
along the entire body sequence. A 16-residue window
was then used in our GSWM technique as described
previously. To obviate problems and degeneracies occurring in the computation of the pR due to the absence of
one or more residues in the 16-base stretch, we added a
20-residue peptide consisting of all 20 individual amino
acids to the beginning of the window and thus had a
36-residue window for the GSWM technique: The first
20 aa remains constant for all computations and the last
16 residues varied depending on the sequence. Since we
were interested in determining whether and which pR’s
were equal between strains, and not on the magnitude
of the pR’s, this artifice proved adequate for our purpose.
Since the body region is composed of 379 aa, the
GSWM gave us 379-15 = 364 pR values for each strain.
Comparing the results positionwise between the 514
strains, we were able to determine at each position how
many different pR were there, thus giving us a quantitative estimate of the variability in the 16-residue profile
at each position for all the sequences (Figure 2). Figure
3 and Additional file 1 show that in 6 regions (marked
as A to F in Figure 2) along the NA protein body primary sequence the variability is significantly low. These
are specifically at around residue position numbers 104
(point A in Figure 2), 177 (B), 277 (C), 334 (D) and 386
(E) with a comparative minimum also at window position 441 (F), which corresponds to the 50-base conserved region at the 3’ end of the RNA sequence.

All the 16 residue long amino acid segments other
than the last region mentioned above seem better conserved than the C-terminal end segment. A potentially
conserved portion in the protein needs to be solvent
accessible for showing optimum interaction with its
environment. However biological importance of a conserved peptide stretch increases many-fold as it becomes
surface exposed or solvent accessible. Assuming that
solvent accessibility may be indicative of accessibility of
the site to potentially interacting portion of molecules,
we next determined the solvent accessibility at each
position of the sequence using SABLE secondary structure prediction server. Figure 2 (brown coloured plot)
shows the results for a sample set of 20 strains used for
the purpose.
To make a comparison between the variability results
obtained from the GSWM for the 16-residue window
analysis of the 514 H5N1 NAs, we constructed a 16residue moving average of the solvent accessibility data.
Figure 2 shows the plots of the two data sets - brown
plot for the ASA and blue coloured plot for the GSWM
results. A reasonably good correlation, 0.49 at 0.01 significance level, can be seen between the variability of
the N1 strain protein sequences and solvent accessibility
within the body region, though sequences included in
stalk and transmembrane region do not show such a
good correlation. We notice that regions of high solvent
accessibility have high variability of the residues. This
indicates that regions of the protein that are not accessible to the outside are more restricted in their mutations,
whereas segments that are more easily accessible to outside influences can accommodate a greater degree of
change implying that the interior of the protein is more
stable, perhaps for structural reasons. This analysis
shows that whatever individual hydrophobic or hydrophilic properties each residue may have, the co-operative
effect of a stretch of peptides is quite important.
The last segment of the protein sequence is slightly
different from the other apparently stable segments
identified hitherto. In this segment, as can be seen from
Figure 2, while the protein sequence variability is seen
to decline, the solvent accessibility factor is seen to
increase. Thus as we come closer to the last 16 residues,
we find that this stretch is considerably solvent accessible, while at the same time being highly conserved. To
understand this apparent divergence, we studied the
crystallographic evidence of the structure of this region.
Figure 3 and Additional file 1 show that this 16-residue
C-terminal region of the protein sequence resides on
the surface of the quaternary structure and appears to
participate in the binding of one subunit of the quaternary structure to the next. It is therefore not surprising
that this segment of the protein is quite well conserved
for its structural stability, and it is at the same time

accessible to the outside. According to recent structural
biology research, a stretch of conserved surface residues
or regions of a solvent accessible protein can be of significant biological importance in terms of enabling protein-protein binding [63], allosteric regulation [64],
oligomerization [65], signal peptides activity [43] etc.
Thus any molecule that targets this conserved surface
stretch can interfere with the protein’s normal biological
activity leading to the protein’s malfunction. Recent
pharmaceutical research frequently uses allosteric modulator [66] for designing drug molecules without side
effects and toxic effects. In contrast, as can be seen
from Additional file 1, the other five regions that would
appear from Figure 2 to be highly conserved have a
majority of the sequence in the interior of the protein
and thus not as accessible to the environment. Here we
propose that the conserved 16 aa region at the C-terminal end as determined by our analyses can be targeted
to explore it’s biological importance and consequent
development of inhibitory molecules targeting this section for efficient control of viral infection.

Conclusions
Our analyses of the 16 aa stretch at the C-terminal of
the NA protein for the H5N1 avian flu strains and the
very recent H1N1 swine flu strains, and also other influenza subtypes, have shown its strongly conserved nature.
This can be attributed to its possible role as a stitching
agent for the stability of its tetrameric structure; while
the gene sequence undergoes several mutations, these
are mostly synonymous permitting very little variance in
the amino acid composition implying that the asynonymous mutations must be eliminated due to functional
requirements. Also, protein-protein interactions in such
regions are known to lead to functional instability
through realignment of the docking region. Comparisons with the solvent accessibility profile and 3D structure have shown that a major part of this stretch of the
protein sequence is surface situated. Thus, it is possible
to hypothesize that this segment is important for the
stability of the NA protein and any destabilization
initiated through it could lead to neutralization of the
NA’s effectiveness as an agent for the proliferation of
the influenza virions in vivo.
Additional file 1: PyMOL generated movie showing distribution of
surface exposed portions of conserved segments in NA. The movie
was generated by rocking the cyan coloured monomer in x-axis by 180
degrees. Colour schemes of the conserved segment stretches are same
as in Figure 3. Five of the conserved segments are seen to have small
sections surface exposed, while the 16 aa C-terminal amino acids (in
blue) is found to be fully exposed and highly solvent accessible.
