Abstract
Background: Well known for its gene density and the large number of mapped diseases, the
human sub-chromosomal region Xq28 has long been a focus of genome research. Over 40 of
approximately 300 X-linked diseases map to this region, and systematic mapping, transcript
identification, and mutation analysis has led to the identification of causative genes for 26 of these
diseases, leaving another 17 diseases mapped to Xq28, where the causative gene is still unknown.
To expedite disease gene identification, we have initiated the functional characterisation of all
known Xq28 genes.
Results: By using a systematic approach, we describe the Xq28 genes by RNA in situ hybridisation
and Northern blotting of the mouse orthologs, as well as subcellular localisation and data mining
of the human genes. We have developed a relational web-accessible database with comprehensive
query options integrating all experimental data. Using this database, we matched gene expression
patterns with affected tissues for 16 of the 17 remaining Xq28 linked diseases, where the causative
gene is unknown.
Conclusion: By using this systematic approach, we have prioritised genes in linkage regions of
Xq28-mapped diseases to an amenable number for mutational screens. Our database can be
queried by any researcher performing highly specified searches including diseases not listed in
OMIM or diseases that might be linked to Xq28 in the future.

Background
The human sub-chromosomal region Xq28 has been a
focus of genome research for the last 20 years, because

many diseases have been linked to this region. Systematic
mapping and transcript identification at this region was
performed in the early and mid nineties [1-4], while the

subsequent availability of the human and mouse genome
sequences enabled further gene predictions [5,6]. While
gene density along the X chromosome as a whole is below
genome average, that of the sub-chromosomal region
Xq28 is far above the average (NCBI Map Viewer [7]).
Covering approximately 5% of the chromosome, Xq28
harbours almost 13% of the X chromosomal genes. The
region spans 7.75 megabases of genomic DNA [8] and
harbours 105 non-redundant, confirmed protein-coding
genes (NCBI Map Viewer [7]). To date, more than 40 diseases have been mapped to Xq28. For 26 of these, the
causative genes have been identified. Among them Xlinked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD, OMIM #300100,
[9]), X-linked myotubular myopathy (MTM1, OMIM
#310400, [10]), X-linked Dyskeratosis Congenita (DKC1,
OMIM #305000, [11]), and Rett Syndrome (MECP2,
OMIM #312750, [12]). However, for 17 of the Xq28mapped diseases, the causative gene is still unknown. Ten
of them are associated with mental retardation, either as
one clinical feature, which is part of a syndrome (syndromic), or as the only primary symptom among affected
individuals (non-syndromic). Most of these 17 diseases
are rare, limiting fine mapping approaches due to the low
patient numbers available for linkage studies. In addition,
diagnosis is often imprecise, because of variable phenotypes. Divergence in phenotypes can be caused for

instance by environmental factors, the different genetic
background of patients, or different mutations within the
same gene. The size of the mapped regions of these 17 diseases varies between 0.6 and 7.75 megabases (figure 1)
and renders mutational screens for disease association
laborious and difficult. For example, the mapped region
for the Waisman Syndrome [13] harbours more than 80
genes. To expedite disease gene identification, we took the
next step in systematic Xq28 analysis and initiated a functional description of all Xq28 genes. As the tissue expression pattern of a gene particularly at the cell type level, as
well as the intracellular localisation of the encoded protein provides highly relevant information regarding function, we systematically studied the Xq28 genes by RNA in
situ hybridisation, Northern blotting, subcellular localisation, and data mining. Using this functional information,
we aimed to narrow down the number of putative disease
genes to a manageable set of promising candidates for
mutational screens. We organised all experimental data in
a relational database enabling comprehensive query
options. Using this database with the presumption that all
diseases base on single gene mutations, we compared
expression patterns of genes with disease phenotypes.
This led to the identification of prioritised candidate disease genes for 16 of the 17 Xq28-mapped diseases that do
not have a gene associated yet.

Results
RNA in situ hybridisation
We studied the expression of the respective orthologous
mouse genes by RNA in situ hybridisation and Northern
blot analysis or RT-PCR as the first step of our systematic
functional analysis. Fifteen MAGE-A or GABRE family
members were excluded from the total of 105 confirmed
human protein-coding Xq28 genes. The human MAGE-A
genes are silent in normal tissues, except for male germ
cells. And also the mouse orthologs have been described
to be not expressed in normal adult tissues, again with the
exception of male germ cells [14]. For the remaining 90
genes, 74 mouse orthologs could be identified, all these

genes mapping in the synthenic region on the murine X
chromosome. For six of the orthologs, the expression patterns have already been published [15-20]. In this work,
we analysed tissue expression patterns for the remaining
68 mouse orthologs first by Northern blot or RT-PCR followed by RNA in situ hybridisation. Tissue sections of four
embryonic stages and ten adult tissues were used to study
expression at the cell type level. By combining results from
three independent methods, we attained a comprehensive
overall picture on the tissue expression profiles of the
genes under investigation. We obtained an expression pattern for 65 (94%) of the analysed genes by RNA in situ
hybridisation and/or Northern blotting/RT-PCR. In

Northern blot/RT-PCR analysis, 37 (57%) of the genes
showed expression in all tissues analysed. Different splice
variants could be detected for 29 (45%) of the genes. In
RNA in situ hybridisation, 30 genes showed enhanced
expression in at least one of the analysed tissues. All tissue
expression profiles, as well as original images are accessible through the web-interface of the database, which is
described in more detail below. Original images from in
situ hybridisation were included in the database in all of
those cases, where different expression could be observed
in different cell types of a tissue, i.e. when in situ hybridisation adds more detailed information on expression
compared to Northern Blot analysis. In situ hybridisation
results that are not linked to original images showed an
even expression of the respective gene in the different cell
types of that tissue. For Northern analysis, all original
images are included in the database.
Subcellular localisation
In parallel, we determined the specific subcellular localisation of the respective human proteins, as the cellular
environment contributes information on the possible
suite of interaction partners a protein may have and consequently on its potential function(s). Open reading
frames of 57 of the human Xq28 genes were amplified
and cloned into suitable fluorescent fusion protein

expression vectors [21]. Subcellular localisation was analysed by fluorescence microscopy in transiently expressing
tissue culture cells. Since the presence of the fluorescence
tag can mask important targeting signals present at either
ends of the protein, all proteins were expressed and analysed both as N-terminal and C-terminal fusion proteins.
Together with original images, the localisations are provided at our web-accessible database.
Data integration
We created an annotation scheme for the analysis of the
expression data, differentiating between 29 organs (e.g.
brain), 78 tissues (e.g. cerebellum), 40 sub-tissues (e.g.
Purkinje cell layer), and 26 cell types (e.g. Purkinje cells).
The level of expression was quantified by manual assignment into one of the classes "weak signal", "signal",
"strong signal", "ubiquitous", and "enhanced". Together
with more than 500 original images and the subcellular
localisation results, this information has been organised
in a relational database, integrating all experimental
results, in addition to web-accessible annotation data for
all the genes under investigation. The data can be queried
through a web-interface according to various criteria and
Boolean combinations ("AND", "OR"), such as developmental stages, tissue types, hybridisation signal intensities, numbers of transcripts, subcellular compartment, or

to primary data (images, probe and clone information)
and to external websites (e.g. NCBI, UCSC) or in XML. In
addition to the query interface, a map-like view scaled to
chromosomal positions is available, where gene symbols
are linked to experimental data, and gene positions to the
corresponding regions within the UCSC genome browser.
Due to a highly flexible database structure, new data can
be entered easily and is readily available via the web-interface [22].
Identification of candidate disease genes
For the identification of candidate disease genes, we queried the Xq28 database to screen for expression patterns
that fit to affected tissues in seventeen Xq28-mapped diseases, for which the causative gene is still unknown. Ten
of these diseases are associated with mental retardation,
syndromic as well as non-syndromic forms.

First we concentrated on hippocampus, cerebellum, and
the olfactory bulb. A number of genes causing mental
retardation, for example MECP2 (OMIM +300005) [18],
NDP (OMIM+310600) [23], FMR2 (OMIM +309548)
[24], or SLC6A8 (OMIM *300036) (this work) have
already been reported to have elevated expression in these
brain regions compared to other areas of the brain (see
table 1). Because of this high compliance we expected that
also other genes involved in mental retardation might be
highly expressed in these regions. For eighteen genes analysed by RNA in situ hybridisation we found an enhanced
expression in one or several of these regions (table 1).
Four genes, namely Atp6ap1, Hcfc1, Idh3g, and Cd99l2,
showed enhanced expression in all of the three brain
regions.
In figure 3, expression of Atp6ap1 in adult mouse brain is
shown. Enhanced expression can be observed in the cells
of the hippocampus, the Purkinje cells in the cerebellum
and the mitral cells in the olfactory bulb. Results for the
other three genes can be viewed at our web-accessible
database.
We then extended the analysis to diseases and symptoms
other than mental retardation, or diseases where mental
retardation is only part of a syndrome. To select tissues for
each disease that may be affected, we used the phenotypic
description within the OMIM database [25]. Next, we
screened our database for genes that show significant
expression in tissues affected by the diseases. In this
screen, expression patterns of additional genes could be
matched to affected tissues of the Xq28-mapped diseases.
We took the mapping information of the 17 Xq28mapped diseases and listed those genes for each disease,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/29

whose expression pattern overlap with potential affected
tissues, and which are located in or nearby the respective
linkage region. We included nearby genes because linkage
analysis often is imprecise. By these means, we prioritised
one or several candidate genes for 16 of the 17 Xq28mapped diseases. The results are summarised in table 2.
Good matches of expression pattern with affected tissues
in disease were obtained for Rpl10 with Goeminne/TKCR
sydrome (OMIM %314300), and for Stk23 with X-linked
myopathy with excessive autophagy (XMEA, OMIM
%310440). Rpl10 shows ubiquitous expression in Northern blot analysis (figure 4b), and also in RNA in situ
hybridisation a signal was obtained in most of the analysed tissues. Strong expression of the gene was observed
in the adult brain, especially in the hippocampal formation and cells of the hypothalamus. Also different cell
types in the male and female reproductive system have
shown a higher expression of the gene, like the leydig cells
in adult testis, the pseudostratified columnar epithelium
(epididymis) and the cells of the simple columnar epithelium in the cervical glands. The analysis of embryonic tissues has pointed out that the gene is also higher expressed
in some tissues of dpc 16.5 embryo, like in the epithelial
cells of the gut, in kidney, lung, and thymus as well as in
the serous glands in the nasal cavity and the clavicle. Figure 4a presents some of the results from the RNA in situ
hybridisation. For the serine/threonine kinase 23 gene
Stk23 the expression was highest in heart, spleen, muscle,
and testis by Northern blot analysis, whereas by RNA in
situ hybridisation, an enhanced signal in embryonic muscle was observed (figure 4câd).

Discussion
Identification of candidate genes for diseases involving
mental retardation
The hippocampus, cerebellum, and the olfactory bulb are
associated with basic properties of learning and memory
in all mammals [26], which is in accordance with the
hypothesis that these brain regions are affected tissues in
mental retardation syndromes. Mice with a gene knock
out of L1cam develop a smaller than normal hippocampus with fewer pyramidal and granule cells [27]. Mutations in the human ortholog cause different forms of
mental retardation, like the MASA syndrome/spastic paraplegia type 1 (# 303350) and Hydrocephalus (# 30700).
An enhanced expression in hippocampus, cerebellum,
and the olfactory bulb has been shown for several genes
known to cause mental retardation, namely MECP2 [18],
NDP [23], FMR2 [24], and SLC6A8 (this work), whereas
their putative molecular functions are diverse (table 1).
Because of these findings, we based our search for candidate mental retardation genes on the hypothesis, that a
gene causing a disease is expressed in tissues affected by
this disease. So that disease association could be con-

cluded from expression pattern rather than from a particular molecular function. Interestingly, evolutionary
conservation of genes causing mental retardation appears
to be frequently restricted to vertebrates, as it is the case
for five of the six known mental retardation genes shown
in table 1. Eighteen genes analysed by RNA in situ hybridisation showed an enhanced expression in one or several
of these brain regions (table 1). Five of them are known
disease genes, but thirteen had not been associated with
disease before. The observed expression pattern renders
them primary candidates for Xq28-mapped diseases
involving mental retardation. Moreover, for five of these
18 genes evolutionary conservation is restricted to vertebrates (table 1). According to their chromosomal location, each of these genes represents a candidate for a
subset of Xq28-mapped diseases, for which the disease
regions overlap (table 2).
The mouse orthologs of the human genes ATP6AP1,
HCFC1, IDH3G, and CD99L2, show enhanced expression
in all of the three brain regions. The putative molecular
functions of these four candidate genes are diverse
(SOURCE web tool of Stanford University [28]), as it is
the case for the previously described known mental retardation genes (SLC6A8, MECP2, NDP, FMR2, and SLC6A8,
table 1). However, their enhanced expression in hippocampus, cerebellum and the olfactory bulb renders them
strong candidates for Xq28-mapped diseases involving
mental retardation. Moreover, for two of these four candidates (ATP6AP1 and CD99L2), phylogenetic conservation
is restricted to vertebrates, as can be observed for a
number of known mental retardation genes (table 1). For
CD99L2, a possible association with diseases involving
mental retardation could be implicated also by its putative function: Its high expression in neuronal cells is conserved in mammals and zebra fish and suggests a
dominant role in neural development [29].
Identification of candidate genes for other diseases
When searching for candidate genes for diseases other
than mental retardation, or for diseases where mental
retardation is only part of a syndrome, we stuck to the
hypothesis, that disease association correlates with expression in tissues affected by this disease. Based on the hypothesis mentioned above, we searched for expression
patterns that match potentially affected tissues of Xq28mapped diseases, using OMIM phenotypic descriptions to
list such tissues [25]. By these means, we could prioritise
candidate genes for 16 of the 17 Xq28-mapped diseases
(table 2). Between one and 12 genes with matched expression pattern could be listed for each disease, a number
which is amenable to mutational screening approaches.
Moreover, for most of the diseases, one to four genes with
best matching expression patterns could be highlighted
(table 2, candidate genes in bold), which could be started

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/29

within mutational screens. Some of the genes are candidates for more than one disease, because of an overlap of
symptoms and the overlap of the candidate regions.
Very good matches of expression pattern with affected tissues could be identified for Rpl10 with Goeminne/TKCR
syndrome, and for Stk23with X-linked Myopathy/XMEA.
TKCR syndrome is characterised by torticollis, keloids,
cryptorchidism, reproductive system abnormalities, and
renal dysplasia. For Rpl10, we observed an enhanced
expression in brain, in different cell types of the reproductive system, and in embryonic kidney (figure 4a). The
Rpl10 protein is a component of the 60S ribosomal subunit and belongs to the L10 family of ribosomal proteins.
It is required for 60S pre-ribosome assembly [30], nuclear
export of the 60S subunit [31], and the yeast ortholog
Qsr1p was shown to be required for 60S/40S joining [32].
On the X chromosome, RPL10 locates very close upstream
to the TKCR linkage region, but disease mapping by linkage analysis is often imprecise. Due to its expression pattern, and taking imprecise linkage analysis into
consideration, RPL10 is a good candidate for TKCR syndrome.
For Stk23, a prominent signal in skeletal muscle and heart
was observed through all developmental stages. It is also
expressed in adult lung, spleen, testis, cerebellum, and the
olfactory bulb (figure 4câd). Due to the remarkable
expression pattern in embryonic muscle, STK23 could be
a candidate for X-linked Myopathy/XMEA. XMEA is characterised by slowly progressing muscle weakness and
excessive autophagy. An allelism with Emery-Dreifuss
muscular dystrophy has been excluded [33]. STK23 is a
serine/threonine protein kinase also known as musclespecific serine kinase 1 (MSSK1).
Our hypothesis, that a gene causative for a disease is
expressed in tissues affected by this disease, is of course
limited, as the timely limited expression of a dysfunctional gene during development for example might lead
to a disease, which might become manifest in the adult
tissue only. An alternative route to look for disease genes,
based on the molecular function of the candidates, could
be followed. However, for this route, the molecular functions of the genes within the linkage regions and the
molecular pathologies of the diseases have to be known.
This is not the case for many Xq28 genes and diseases.
Moreover, as mentioned above, for several known mental
retardation genes enhanced expression has been shown in
brain regions, which are associated with functions
impaired in mentally retarded patients.
In this context, our study might help to select genes to
start with in mutational screens, where the linkage region

of the disease is large and contains a high number of
genes.

genome browser [38]. This left us with a non-redundant
set of 105 human Xq28 genes.

Data accessibility
The goal of our study was to use the functional information to prioritise candidate disease genes. For this purpose, it was necessary to organise and integrate this large
and heterogeneous dataset. Since our data is organised in
a web-accessible database [22], all information may also
be used by the scientific community applying highly specified queries with individual focus. By these means, every
researcher is able to use the data to prioritise candidate
disease genes, both for diseases not listed in OMIM and
for diseases that may be discovered and/or mapped to
Xq28 in the future. In the last years, a lot of different systematic expression studies have become founded like the
approaches on chromosome 21 genes [34,35], as well as
the Allen Brain Atlas [36] and the EMAGE gene expression
database [37]. All of these projects cover a large amount of
genes, but in comparison to our study they present only
one tissue type or embryonic stage. With our approach, a
large diversity of adult tissues and embryonic stages is covered. Combined with the subcellular localisation data, we
gain a lot of information about the genes in this particular
region. As the possibility of performing specified queries
might also be interesting for similar datasets on other
chromosomal regions, researchers are welcome to contact
us to get detailed technical information on our system.

Selection of orthologous mouse cDNAs
Open reading frames of human Xq28 genes were searched
with the BLASTN2 algorithm against different murine
databases within the HUSAR program package supplied
by the DKFZ Biocomputing Service [39]. The GeneFinder
from CGAP [40] and NCBI Map Viewer [7] were cDNA
clones suitable for probe generation.

Conclusion
To enhance the speed of gene identification of Xq28mapped diseases, we have startet to functionally describe
the Xq28 genes by expression analysis and subcellular
localisation. Our dataset is organised in a relational database with comprehensive query options. This database is
freely accessible [22]. We have used the database to match
potential affected tissues of Xq28-mapped diseases with
expression patterns of genes located within or close to the
respective linkage region. By these means, we highlighted
candidate genes for 16 of the 17 Xq28-mapped diseases
(table 2). By using our database and its query options,
every researcher could prioritise candidate genes with
individual focus. Our results should enable faster disease
gene identification by concentrating on these prioritised
candidate genes in mutational screens.

Methods
Gene Selection
The NCBI Map Viewer [7] was queried for genes located in
Xq28. Novel genes with cDNA/EST representation but
without confirmed gene locus were disregarded. Pseudogenes and non-protein coding genes were disregarded,
too. The remaining genes were checked for redundancy.
Also, the chromosomal localisation of the genes was verified using BLAT search within the GoldenPath human

If available, cDNA clones were ordered from the RZPD
[41]. Where no cDNA clone was available, or when the
cDNA clone was not suitable for probe generation,
hybridisation templates were generated by RT-PCR using
primers designed on the murine RefSeq entry. All clone
and primer information can be retrieved from our Xq28
database [22].
PCR and RT-PCR
All primer information and PCR conditions for every single clone can be retrieved from our Xq28 database [22].
RNA in situ hybridisation
Manual ISH was performed on embryo sections at stages
dpc 10.5, 12.5, 14.5, 16.5 and with different tissues of
adult mice. Embryos were isolated from pregnant NMRI
mice. The day of plug detection was considered to be day
0.5 postconception (dpc). The tissues and embryonic
stages were fixed over night in 4% paraformaldehyde in
phosphate-buffered saline at 4Â°C. The tissues from adult
NMRI mice were isolated after perfusion with 4% PFA in
phosphate-buffered saline. After embedding in paraffin,
6-Î¼m sections were mounted on 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane-coated slides and hybridisation was performed as
described previously [42] using gene-specific antisense
and sense RNA probes. Cloned PCR products were
sequence-verified to identify orientation of the product
within the vector. The antisense and sense probes were
generated by in vitro transcription using Sp6 and T7 RNA
polymerase, respectively, after linearisation of the construct. Detailed probe information can be retrieved from
our web-accessible database. For radioactive hybridisation, Î±-35S-UTP was incorporated into the probes. After
washing, the slides were coated with NTB-2 liquid emulsion (IBS Integra Biosciences), exposed for 2 to 4 weeks at
4Â°C, developed, and counter stained with hematoxylin
and eosin. Slides were analysed using an Olympus BX50
microscope. Photographs were taken with a LCD-camera
(Power head, Sony) and the AnalySIS software (Soft imaging System GmbH). The figures were assembled using
Adobe Photoshop.

Northern hybridisation
Clontech Northern filters with poly-(A)+ RNA from mouse
(7762-1, 7763-1) and self-made RNA- blots with total
RNA were hybridised with the 32P-labelled purified PCR
products also used for cloning into the vector with dual
T7/SP6 promoter. Hybridisations were carried out overnight in Church solution (1 M Na2HPO4, 1 M
NaH2PO4Â·H2O, 10 mM EDTA, pH8.0) at 65Â°C. Filters
were washed once in 0.1% SDS/0.1ÃSSC for 10 min and
once in 0.1% SDS/0.3ÃSSC for 10 min and exposed to
Kodak Bio Max at -80Â°C.
Cloning of ORFs into the the Gatewayâ¢ cloning system
ORFs were amplified from cDNA clones omitting the 5'
and 3' UTRs. PCR primer pairs were selected using the
PRIDE program [43]. The 5' end of the forward ORF
primer was fixed to the start ATG. To allow expression of
C-terminal fusions, the 5' end of the reverse ORF primer
was fixed to the last amino acid coding triplet, leaving out
the stop codon. Gatewayâ¢ recombination sites were
attached during PCR by a 2-step strategy: The first PCR
was done with gene-specific primers plus a 9 (forward
primer) or 11 (reverse primer) base pair overhang.
Recombination sites were completed in a nested PCR
using the corresponding overhangs. PCR primers were
purchased from Invitrogen. Amplification of ORFs was
done using the Expand High Fidelity amplification system
(Roche). PCR products were cloned by recombination
into the entry vector pDONR201 and shuttled into N-terminal CFP and C-terminal YFP expression vectors after
sequence validation.
Subcellular localisation of N- and C-terminal fusions
proteins
Localisation analysis has been described elsewhere [21].
In brief, expression plasmids were transfected into Vero
cells (ATCC CCL81) using FuGENE6 transfection reagent
(Roche). Living cells were imaged at 20 and 40 h after
transfection and image acquisition was performed on a
Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope with standard filter sets. All
ORFs were analysed as both N- and as C-terminal fusion
proteins to minimise the effects of aberrant localisation
due to the position of the tag.
Database design and data processing
Data from construction of expression-clones and protein
localisation was processed as described [44]. Probe and
clone information and images from in-situ hybridisation
and Northern blots were stored on a MS-SQL-Server
(Microsoft). Data entry was done using MS Access forms
as a front-end. For data presentation, a MS IIS-webserver
employing the MS.Net framework was used.
