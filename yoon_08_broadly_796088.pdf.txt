Abstract
Background: Our understanding of the eukaryotic tree of life and the tremendous diversity of
microbial eukaryotes is in flux as additional genes and diverse taxa are sampled for molecular
analyses. Despite instability in many analyses, there is an increasing trend to classify eukaryotic
diversity into six major supergroups: the 'Amoebozoa', 'Chromalveolata', 'Excavata',
'Opisthokonta', 'Plantae', and 'Rhizaria'. Previous molecular analyses have often suffered from either
a broad taxon sampling using only single-gene data or have used multigene data with a limited
sample of taxa. This study has two major aims: (1) to place taxa represented by 72 sequences, 61
of which have not been characterized previously, onto a well-sampled multigene genealogy, and (2)
to evaluate the support for the six putative supergroups using two taxon-rich data sets and a variety
of phylogenetic approaches.
Results: The inferred trees reveal strong support for many clades that also have defining
ultrastructural or molecular characters. In contrast, we find limited to no support for most of the
putative supergroups as only the 'Opisthokonta' receive strong support in our analyses. The
supergroup 'Amoebozoa' has only moderate support, whereas the 'Chromalveolata', 'Excavata',
'Plantae', and 'Rhizaria' receive very limited or no support.
Conclusion: Our analytical approach substantiates the power of increased taxon sampling in
placing diverse eukaryotic lineages within well-supported clades. At the same time, this study
indicates that the six supergroup hypothesis of higher-level eukaryotic classification is likely
premature. The use of a taxon-rich data set with 105 lineages, which still includes only a small
fraction of the diversity of microbial eukaryotes, fails to resolve deeper phylogenetic relationships
and reveals no support for four of the six proposed supergroups. Our analyses provide a point of
departure for future taxon- and gene-rich analyses of the eukaryotic tree of life, which will be
critical for resolving their phylogenetic interrelationships.

Background
A major remaining gap in our knowledge of the tree of life
is the uncertain relationships among eukaryotes, including the many divergent microbial lineages plus plants,
animals and fungi. Microbial eukaryotes, often referred to
as protists, are an eclectic assemblage of lineages that are
defined as eukaryotes that are not plants, animals, or
fungi [1]. Clearly, knowledge of the phylogenetic positions of protists is a key to understanding the origins of
eukaryotes, and where the ancestries of plants, animals
and fungi lie within these microbial groups.
During the 1970's and 1980's a revolution in understanding eukaryotic diversity occurred as a result of ultrastructural studies. These data [2,3] demolished traditional
classifications where algae, protozoa and fungi were considered discrete entities, and microbial eukaryotes were
inappropriately lumped into one of four classes: amoebae, flagellates, ciliates, and sporozoans. Ultrastructural
studies revealed distinct assemblages of organisms that
are distinguished by their complement and organization
of organelles, providing lineages with ultrastructural identities [1]. About 60 different, robust patterns of ultrastructural organization are recognized, but ~200 genera of
uncertain affinities have yet to be examined [1,4]. Determining relationships among groups using ultrastructure,
however, has proven difficult, largely due to the lack of
unambiguously homologous structures.
Early molecular analyses relied on comparisons of rDNAs
from diverse protists and suggested that diplomonads, trichomonads, and microsporidia were basal lineages [5-7].
These analyses of rDNAs sequences also produced a topology with a base and crown (putatively recently radiated)
lineages [8-11], which is now argued to be an artifact of
long branch attraction. Given the well known limitations
of single gene genealogies when inferring deep evolutionary relationships, the current trend is to focus on multigene datasets [12,13]. However, taxon representation in
many of these analyses is sparse. With such incomplete
taxon sampling, distantly related groups may appear as
sister taxa and many deep nodes are poorly supported
[14].
The past decade has seen the emergence of six eukaryotic
'supergroups' that aim to portray evolutionary relationships between microbial and macrobial lineages. The
supergroup concept is increasingly accepted as evidenced
by several reviews [15,16] and the recently proposed formal reclassification by the International Society of Protozoologists [17]. However, the support for supergroups is
highly variable in the published literature [14].
The six putative supergroups have complex and often
unstable histories. The supergroup 'Amoebozoa' was pro-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/14

posed in 1996 [18,19] based largely on molecular genealogies. The controversial supergroup 'Chromalveolata' was
proposed based on the assertion that the last common
ancestor of the 'Chromista' (cryptophytes, haptophytes,
stramenopiles) and the undisputed Alveolata (dinoflagellates, apicomplexans, ciliates) contained a common chlorophyll c-containing red algal plastid [20]. 'Excavata' is
another controversial supergroup composed predominately of heterotrophic flagellates whose ancestor is postulated to have had a synapomorphy of a conserved
ventral feeding groove [21]. The supergroup
'Opisthokonta' includes animals, fungi, and their microbial relatives, and is supported by many molecular genealogies [10]. The 'Opisthokonta' is united by the presence
of a single posterior flagellum in many constituent lineages [22]. The supergroup 'Plantae' was erected as a Kingdom in 1981 [23] to unite the three lineages with doublemembrane primary plastids: green algae (including land
plants), rhodophytes, and glaucophytes. Finally, the
'Rhizaria' emerged from molecular data in 2002 to unite a
heterogeneous group of flagellates and amoebae including: cercomonads, foraminifera, some of the diverse testate amoebae, and former members of the polyphyletic
radiolaria [24].
We believe that comprehensive taxon sampling, coupled
with gene-rich analyses, is critical for resolving accurate
phylogenies [14]. This is particularly relevant for the
eukaryotes where only a tiny fraction of the >200,000 species of microbial eukaryotes have thus far been characterized for any gene sequence, and over one-half of
identified protists groups [1] have yet to be subjected to
any molecular study. Misleading results can also arise if a
study addressing "deeper" splits in the eukaryotic tree
does not include a broad diversity of lineages, including
members of all six putative supergroups [14]. This is
because the addition of diverse lineages is critical to break
long single branches that pose a significant problem for
robust phylogenetic inference. We know that the lack of
adequate sampling and the use of highly derived (e.g.,
parasitic) taxa have created unstable tree topologies and
led to inaccurate statements of sister-group relationships
(i.e., in the creation of the now-abandoned supergroup
Archezoa, whose history is described in [25]). Yet only a
handful of studies have been published that take a multigene taxon-rich approach for assessing the eukaryotic tree
of life.
Here, we set out to accomplish two tasks: (1) place newly
determined sequences from a diversity of microbial
eukaryotes onto relatively well-sampled multigene
eukaryote phylogenies, and (2) evaluate the support for
the six supergroups. Our approach was to use phylogenetic analyses of four genes from two distinct taxon sets
that included 61 newly-characterized sequences. The two

taxon sets represent 1) 105 diverse eukaryotic lineages and
2) a reduced 92 taxon set in which long-branch taxa were
removed. The four loci, SSU-rDNA, actin, alpha-tubulin,
and beta-tubulin, have a rich history in eukaryotic phylogenetics [7,12,26]. These genes have been used for more
intensive studies of some groups such as 'Amoebozoa'
[27], 'Rhizaria' [28] and 'Opisthokonta' [29] as well as for
the establishment of many of the proposed supergroups
[14]. Yet, there are few studies in which a multigene data
set has been combined with extensive taxon sampling
from all six supergroups [30,31].
Our work contrasts with many past efforts that have used
either single-gene data with a broad taxon sampling [811], or multigene data with a limited number of taxa
[12,13,26,32]. We performed individual and concatenated analyses of four genes. To assess rate heterogeneity
and possible lateral gene transfers, we analyzed each gene
individually prior to concatenation and then applied a
variety of phylogenetic inference methods with both DNA
and the inferred protein sequences. Use of a concatenated
data set greatly reduces phylogenetic error in simulation
studies [33] and the large number of characters that we
have obtained for this study is expected to improve the
accuracy of resulting phylogenetic trees [34].
Seventy-two sequences were characterized for this study,
the bulk of which are newly-characterized (47 sequences)
or were previously characterized from other strains (14
sequences), were available as ESTs in public databases (1
sequence) or are previously published and confirmed here
(10 sequences; see Additional file 1). These sequences
include representatives of all six 'Chromalveolata' groups
thereby sampling a sizable fraction of the diversity in this
supergroup. This is critical with respect to overall eukaryotic diversity because 'Chromalveolata' contain about
one-half of the recognized species of protists and algae
[35]. In addition, eight of the ten 'Excavata' lineages were
included in our study. Finally, we also add genes from several lineages within the 'Rhizaria', another poorly supported eukaryotic supergroup [14].

Results and Discussion
Sampling strategy
The 105-taxon dataset was chosen because the included
taxa: (1) contained at least three of the four targeted genes;
and (2) represented the known breadth of eukaryotic
diversity (see additional file 1). These 105 diverse lineages
represent 26 well-established eukaryotic groups as well as
those of uncertain affiliation (e.g., Ancyromonas, Malawimonas, Stephanopogon), and contained members of all six
putative supergroups (see Additional file 1). As discussed
below, a second data set containing 92 taxa was generated
by removing known problematic taxa including long

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/14

branched ciliates [36], foraminifera [37,38], Giardia [39],
plus several others (see Additional file 1).
To assess the impact of evolutionary models and phylogenetic methods, both data sets (105 and 92 taxa) were analyzed under five combinations of data and methods: (1) a
four-gene data set (SSU-rDNA, actin, alpha-, and betatubulin) as nucleotides excluding third codon positions
using RAxML, (2) a four-gene data set as nucleotides
excluding third codon positions using MrBayes, (3) a data
set of mixed nucleotide (SSU) and amino acid sequences
using MrBayes, (4) a three-gene data set (actin, alpha-,
and beta-tubulin) as amino acids using MrBayes, and (5)
a three-gene data set (actin, alpha-, and beta-tubulin) as
amino acids using PHYML (Figs. 1, 2, 3 and see Additional
files 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9). We also analyzed individual gene
data sets to identify taxa that are characterized by high
sequence divergence (i.e., a long-branch) or had an unexpected position in the phylogeny (see Additional files 10,
11, 12). Overall, there is some heterogeneity in support
for hypotheses among models and algorithms but the
major trends discussed below were consistent across the
different analyses (summarized in Fig. 1).
Placement of newly-determined sequences
We determined the position of newly characterized taxa
using both the 105 (Fig. 2) and 92 (Fig. 3) taxon data sets.
To simplify comparisons, all of the genealogies are drawn
rooted with 'Opisthokonta', as hypothesized by Arisue et
al. [40] and are generally concordant with previous studies using a similar set of genes [12,41]. We sampled additional genes from several members of the putative
'Rhizaria' including both the SSU rRNA gene and protein
coding genes for a cercomonad Cercomonas sp. (ATCC
PRA-21) and the dimorphid Dimorpha sp. (ATCC PRA54), and protein coding genes for the thaumatomonad
Thaumatomonas seravini (ATCC 50636; see Additional file
1). Relationships among these taxa generally agree with
the proposed phylogeny of core 'Cercozoa' [42,43].

All four genes were analyzed for two amoeboid taxa – the
myxogastrid Hyperamoeba sp. (ATCC PRA-39) and a Thecamoeba-like lineage (ATCC PRA-35) that is currently
being described (Nerad et al., personal communication).
Hyperamoeba sp. is sister to Physarum in all analyses except
in the beta-tubulin protein tree (see Additional file 12).
The Physarum + Hyperamoeba sister group relationship was
predicted on the basis of morphology [44]. The Thecamoeba-like lineage falls close to the mycetozoa plus
Entamoebida. In contrast to published hypotheses
[12,45], we do not find support for the monophyly of dictyostelids plus myxogastrids with our taxon and gene
sampling. This finding is further supported by a well-sampled multigene analysis that included several previouslyuncharacterized 'Amoebozoa' taxa [46].

Overall evaluation of support for nodes in 105 and 92 taxon sets
Overall evaluation of support for nodes in 105 and 92 taxon sets. Support for nodes using different taxon datasets,
algorithms and evolutionary models. The top portion lists taxa with clear ultrastructural identities [1] whereas taxa below the
line represent putative eukaryotic supergroups. As described in the text, two datasets were examined (105 and 92 taxa). R:n
= RAxML analysis of 4 genes as nucleotides, with third codon positions removed; B:n = Bayesian analysis of 4 genes as nucleotides, with third codon positions removed; B:S-A = Bayesian analysis of the SSU-rDNA gene and the remaining three genes
as amino acids; B:A = Bayesian analysis of three genes as amino acids; PhyML = Likelihood analysis under PHYML of three
genes as amino acids. The 'Rhizaria' are indicated by grey boxes for the 92 taxon analysis as there were insufficient taxa to
address this hypothesis; instead, we report support for the nested group 'Cercozoa.'

We also included additional genes from several ciliates
(Nyctotherus ovalis, Metopus palaeformis and Chilodonella
uncinata). In many of the analyses, either there is a spurious relationship between ciliates and the Heterolobosea
(e.g., see Additional files 2 and 3) or the ciliates are
polyphyletic (see Additional files 4 and 5). As has been
shown in previous work, ciliates are marked by considerable heterogeneity in protein evolution as rates of evolution are highly variable among lineages [36,47] and it is
perhaps not surprising that increasing taxon sampling in
this group fails to produce more stable trees. Use of the
rDNA plus amino acid data for both 105 and 92 taxon
data sets however recovers trees that support the expected
monophyly of each of the lineages, ciliates, alveolates,
and Heterolobosea (Figs. 1, 2, 3).

Furthermore, we characterized additional loci from two
enigmatic taxa, the flagellate Ancyromonas sigmoides
(ATCC 50267; species identity from [48]) and Stephanopogon apogon (ATCC 50096). In all our analyses, S. apogon
shows a sister group relationship to the Heterolobosea
(Figs. 1, 2, 3). Stephanopogon apogon has been suggested to
be sister to the Euglenozoa based on mitochondrial cristae
morphology and similarity in nuclear division profiles
[49,50]. Ancyromonas sigmoides is a small, heterotrophic
gliding flagellate with one recurrent and one anterior flagellum and flat mitochondrial cristae [1]. The phylogenetic
position of A. sigmoides varies depending on which phylogenetic method is used. This is the case in other analyses
of a subset of genes [14], suggesting that either there is
inadequate sampling of this lineage or too few data to

resolve its position, or that Ancyromonas represents a novel
lineage of eukaryotes [51].
We also sampled representatives of all six chromalveolate
phyla including multiple members from each phylum.
Together, our analysis included new data for 12 taxa out
of 43 chromalveolates in the tree. These 12 taxa were
placed in their expected positions among the 6 different
'Chromalveolata' phyla, and all received moderate to
strong support (i.e., apicomplexans, cryptophytes, haptophytes, dinoflagellates, stramenopiles) except for ciliates
(see Figs. 1, 2). Within the 'Plantae' the 4-gene data support strongly the early divergence of Mesostigma viride
within the streptophyte branch of the Viridiplantae. This
is consistent with a recent multigene analysis of nuclear,
chloroplast, and mitochondrial data; the 'Plantae' phyla
Glaucophyta and Viridiplantae received strong bootstrap
and Bayesian support whereas there was moderate support for Rhodophyta monophyly [52].
Evaluation of supergroups
Putative eukaryotic supergroups receive mixed support in
our analyses of the 105-taxon dataset. To improve our
understanding of supergroup support, we compare these
results with a recent studies including one [30] that used
a concatenated alignment of 16-proteins but fewer (46)
taxa (see inset in Fig. 1). In the present analyses, the supergroup 'Opisthokonta', receives high bootstrap support
(>95%) and a significant posterior probability (1.00)
under several of the different models and algorithms (R:n,
B:S-A, B-A; Fig. 1). The relationship of at least some members of this supergroup emerged in previously published
rDNA [10] and multigene analyses [12,30,41]. In addition, there are two compelling synapomorphies for this
group: (1) the presence of a single flagellum in flagellate
members of this group, with the flagellum 'posterior' in
that it beats from base to tip and projects behind swimming cells, and (2) a unique amino acid insertion in those
members that contain a canonical EF-1α gene [53] (some
members of the 'Opisthokonta' have an EF-like protein
and not EF-1α [54]). The inclusion of animals and fungi
within 'Opisthokonta' refutes the monophyly of animals
plus plants that has been suggested in some recent studies
[55].

The putative supergroup 'Amoebozoa' receives high support only under a limited number of models and algorithms, including strong support (posterior probability =
1.00) under Bayesian analyses of amino acid sequences
(B:A) and of SSU-rDNA as nucleotides plus amino acid
sequences (B:S-A). However, this supergroup is poorly
supported or not monophyletic in the three other analyses
(Fig. 1). This is consistent with the fact that 'Amoebozoa'
is defined largely by molecular phylogenies and lacks any
clearly defined ultrastructural synapomorphies. In addi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/14

tion, our analyses fail to provide support for the 'unikont
hypothesis', which argues for the monophyly of the
'Amoebozoa' plus 'Opisthokonta' [12,15,16,56-58]. The
lack of support for 'unikonts' may reflect insufficient phylogenetic signal in our data sets. Alternatively, the hypothesized 'unikont' monophyly may be an artifact of limited
taxon sampling in previous multigene studies.
The 'Rhizaria' receives only limited support (e.g., bootstrap support under RAxML <50% with the nucleotide
data [R:n] and 6% under PHYML; Fig. 1). The 'Rhizaria'
are supported by some published molecular phylogenies
[42,59,60], but not by others [14]. The core Cercozoa
show a sister-group relationship to the stramenopiles in
all multigene analysis (Fig 2, 3, S1-S8), but without significant posterior probability or bootstrap support. This
result is consistent with a recent multigene (85-protein)
phylogenetic study from a limited number of taxa [30]
that supports the sister relationship of Reticulomyxa
(Foraminifera) plus Bigelowiella (chlorarachniophyte)
with stramenopiles [41]. The relationship between
'Rhizaria' and Stramenopiles suggested by Hackett et al.
(2007) has strong bootstrap and Bayesian support in their
analyses and is the significantly favored topology using
the approximately unbiased (AU) test. An independent
study using a larger data set of nearly 30,000 amino acid
positions also reported a specific relationship between
'Rhizaria' and 'Chromalveolates' [61]. This intriguing
result needs to be tested using additional analyses that
include more extensive taxon sampling.
The remaining three putative supergroups – 'Chromalveolata', 'Plantae', and 'Excavata' – are not found to be
monophyletic (Fig. 1). In these analyses as in many others, members of the putative 'Excavata' are non-monophyletic [14]. This putative supergroup contains lineages
whose ancestor is postulated to have had a distinctive
feeding groove [1,24,62]. Here, we find two subclades of
'Excavata', albeit with mixed support (Fig. 1). The first
group is consistent with the hypothesized 'Fornicata'
[17,58]: Diplomonadida plus Carpediemonas. The second
includes the Heterolobosea plus Euglenozoa, which share
'discoidal' mitochondria cristae and have been recovered
in other multigene phylogenies [12,14]. The phylogenetic
position of the putative 'Excavata' lineage Malawimonas is
unstable in our analyses (Figs. 2, 3, see Additional files 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) and more data are needed to test its relationship to other excavates.
The supergroup 'Plantae' – Rhodophyta (red algae), Glaucophyta, and Viridiplantae (green algae and land plants)
– is consistently polyphyletic (Fig. 2, 3). The case for 'Plantae' monophyly is largely based on plastid encoded genes
[63,64], plus recent evidence from some nuclear encoded
proteins that are plastid targeted [65,66] and nuclear

genes that encode cytosolic proteins [30,57,67]. Other
lines of evidence for 'Plantae' monophyly come from
analysis of the plastid machinery including plastid targeted metabolite translocator genes [68] and the shared
protein import system embedded in the organelle membranes of 'Plantae' members (Tic-Toc system, [69]). Therefore, supergroup 'Plantae' may be monophyletic even
though our present analysis lacks resolution with regard
to this group. The 'Plantae' however remains controversial
because its monophyly is not supported by several other
multigene data sets using nuclear loci, thus retaining the
possibility that this supergroup may be paraphyletic or
polyphyletic [70-72].
We find no support for the putative supergroup 'Chromalveolata', despite the addition of numerous species from
this lineage; i.e., 43 putative members in the 105 taxon
dataset. The chromalveolate hypothesis unites the chlorophyll c-containing photosynthetic eukaryotes and their
relatives and includes the cryptophytes, haptophytes, stramenopiles, apicomplexa, dinoflagellates, and ciliates
[20]. The common origin of the plastid in chromalveolates, like in the Plantae, is supported by plastid multigene
analyses [63,64,73], trees inferred from plastid-targeted
proteins such as GAPDH and FBA [74-76] and plastid
translocator genes (for apicomplexans, haptophytes, and
stramenopiles, [68]).

erolobosea (i.e., posterior probability support increases
from 0.77 to full support under a B-n analysis; Fig. 1) and
red algae (i.e., posterior probability support increases
from 0.69 to 0.85 in B-n analysis; Fig 1.) There is also an
increase in support for two supergroups, 'Amoebozoa'
and 'Opisthokonta,' in our 92-taxon analysis (Fig. 1). For
example, posterior probability support for the 'Amoebozoa' increases from <0.50 to 0.85 in the B-n analysis. A
result of removing the long-branch Foraminifera to generate our 92 taxon set is that we no longer can assess the
'Rhizaria' because the remaining members represent only
the subclade 'Cercozoa', as indicated in Figure 1; this subclade does show robust support with the 92 taxon data set
(Fig. 1). Removal of problematic taxa does not provide
any support for three supergroups, 'Chromalveolata,'
'Excavata,' and 'Plantae.'
Explanations for the limited support or lack of monophyly of the supergroups (with the exception of
'Opisthokonta' and to a lesser extent 'Amoebozoa')
include: (1) taxon and gene sampling is too limited to
support these deep relationships and (2) these putative
supergroups do not reflect accurately deep relationships
within eukaryotes. Disentangling these alternatives will
require the use of both a broad taxon sampling, as used
here, combined with greater sequence data.

Conclusion
Relationships among 'Chromalveolata' were recently
tested using a 16-nuclear protein dataset that provided
moderate bootstrap support for 'Chromalveolata' monophyly when including 'Rhizaria' (see inset in Fig. 1; [30]).
However, most nuclear (host) trees using single and multigene analyses provide limited or no support for the
monophyly of this supergroup (reviewed in [14]). Most
clearly, our trees as well as recent published studies [30]
refute the 'Chromista' hypothesis because we find no support for the monophyly of haptophytes plus stramenopiles plus cryptophytes, as is found in some plastid gene
trees [54]. Instead, our 92 taxon tree (Fig. 3) supports the
monophyly of stramenopiles and Alveolata (ciliates, apicomplexa, and dinoflagellates) that is consistent with the
results of other studies [12,30]. Given that 'Chromista' is
invalid then the 'Chromalveolata' hypothesis as proposed
by Cavalier-Smith [20] is also falsified by our study.
Impact of Taxon Sampling
We assessed how the removal of known problematic taxa
affected the support for clades with ultrastructural identities and for putative supergroups using the reduced 92taxon dataset (Figs. 1, 3, see Additional files 6, 7, 8, 9).
Although we see an increase in support for clades with
ultrastructural identities, the reduced taxon dataset shows
little improvement for most supergroups. For example,
there is an increase in support for groups such as the Het-

Intriguingly, the level of support in these analyses of four
genes,
including
numerous
newly-characterized
sequences, matches what emerged from a review of the literature on molecular phylogenetic analyses of eukaryotes
in general [14]. In both the analyses presented here and in
our synthesis of the literature [14] the 'Opisthokonta'
receive relatively strong support, the 'Amoebozoa' receive
low to moderate support, and the remaining four supergroups ('Excavata', 'Rhizaria', 'Plantae' and 'Chromalveolata') are unsupported. As discussed above, the core
'Cercozoa' within 'Rhizaria' do show a sister-group relationship to stramenopiles, though our trees provide only
Bayesian support for this result (see Fig. 3). This association of some 'Rhizaria' with some members of the 'Chromalveolata' calls into question the taxonomic validity of
these two supergroups.
As we are using the same set of genes that are present in
many other analyses (including some of those used to
establish the putative supergroups), there is some circularity in the comparison between our and previously published analyses. Hence, assessment of potential
supergroups must await analyses of novel gene data sets
sampled from many taxa, in particular including enigmatic taxa such as Ancyromonas and Malawimonas that
could potentially form independent lineages. Ultimately,
resolving deep nodes will require the use of multigene

alignments incorporating a wide diversity of taxa combined with the identification of robust ultrastructural or
molecular synapomorphies for proposed clades.

Methods
Cultures and molecular methods
One hundred and five species from all six eukaryotic
supergroups were used in this study. We obtained cultures
from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), the
Provasoli-Guillard National Center for Culture of Marine
Phytoplankton (CCMP) and the Culture Collection of
Algae at the University of Texas at Austin (UTEX). Cells
were frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground with glass
beads using a glass rod and/or Mini-BeadBeater™ (Biospec
Products, Inc., Bartlesville, OK, USA). Total genomic DNA
was extracted using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen,
Santa Clarita, CA, USA). Some DNA samples were
obtained directly from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).

Primers for SSU-rDNA genes are from Medlin et al. [77]
with three additional primers that were used to generate
overlapping sequences from each clone as described in
Snoeyenbos-West et al. [78]. Other primers were designed
for actin, alpha-tubulin and beta-tubulin from broad
eukaryotic alignments of these genes. PCR amplification
was carried out using the following primers: actin, AAC
TGG GAY GAY ATG GAR AAG AT and ATC CAC ATY TGY
TGG AAN GT; beta-tubulin, GGT GCT GGT AAY AAY TGR
GC and ACC AGG TCG TTC ATR TTN GA; alpha tubulin,
initial PCR with CTA GGC AAY GCN TGY TGG GA and
CAT GCC TTC NCC NAC RTA CC reamplified with nested
primers TTG TAC TGC YTN GAR CAY G and AC GTA CCA
GTG NAC RAA NGC. Phusion DNA Polymerase, a strict
proofreading enzyme, was used to amplify our genes of
interest and we have used the Lucigen PCRSmart, Novagen Perfectly Blunt, Invitrogen Zero Blunt TOPO, Invitrogen TOPO TA cloning kits. Sequencing of cloned plasmid
DNA was done using vector- or gene-specific primers and
the BigDye™ terminator kit (PE-Applied Biosystems, Norwalk, CT, USA). Sequences were run on an ABI 3100 automated sequencer. We have fully sequenced 2–4 clones of
each gene for each organism and surveyed up to 8 clones
per taxon in order to detect potential paralogs.
Data analysis
To align SSU-rDNA sequences, we used HMMER v2.1.4
[79] whereas protein-coding genes were aligned by Clustal W [80]. For the SSU-rDNA alignment, we aligned the
sequences using HMMER while incorporating secondary
structure. These sequences were downloaded from The
European Ribosomal Database [81]. The resulting alignment was further edited manually in MacClade v4.05
[82]. Protein coding genes were aligned as amino acids
using Clustal W [80] as implemented in DNAstar's Laser-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/14

gene software and manually adjusted in MacClade v4.05
[82]. For the phylogenetic analysis, we restricted our analysis to unambiguously aligned regions for which we were
confident in positional homology as assessed by eye. For
a subset of our analyses, we tried two different masks
(conservative vs. liberal) of ambiguous positions and
found no significant differences in inferences from topologies and support (data not shown).
Genealogies were inferred using MrBayes [83], RAxML
[84] and PHYML [85]. Bayesian analyses were performed
with the parallel version of MrBayes 3.1.2 using the
GTR+I+ Γ (for nucleotide) and RtREV (for amino acid)
models of sequence evolution [86]. Four to 16 simultaneous MCMCMC chains were run for 4 million generations
sampling every 100 generations. Stationarity in likelihood
scores was determined by plotting the -1nL against the
generation. All trees below the observed stationarity level
were discarded, resulting in a 'burnin' that comprised
25% of the posterior distribution of trees. The 50% majority-rule consensus tree was determined to calculate the
posterior probabilities for each node. RAxML was run for
100 iterations using GTRGAMMA model for nucleotide
data and PROTGAMMA with matrix RtREV for amino acid
data. The datasets were partitioned to allow RaxML to
assign different parameters for each gene. One hundred
replicates for bootstrap analyses were run in RAxML and
PHYML, and a 50% majority rule consensus was calculated to determine the support values for each node.
MrModelTest [87] and ProtTest 1.3 [88] were used to
select the appropriate model of sequences evolution for
the nucleotides and amino acid data, respectively.
