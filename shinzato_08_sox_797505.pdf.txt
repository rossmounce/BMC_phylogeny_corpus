Abstract
Background: Sox genes encode transcription factors that function in a wide range of
developmental processes across the animal kingdom. To better understand both the evolution of
the Sox family and the roles of these genes in cnidarians, we are studying the Sox gene complement
of the coral, Acropora millepora (Class Anthozoa).
Results: Based on overall domain structures and HMG box sequences, the Acropora Sox genes
considered here clearly fall into four of the five major Sox classes. AmSoxC is expressed in the
ectoderm during development, in cells whose morphology is consistent with their assignment as
sensory neurons. The expression pattern of the Nematostella ortholog of this gene is broadly similar
to that of AmSoxC, but there are subtle differences – for example, expression begins significantly
earlier in Acropora than in Nematostella. During gastrulation, AmSoxBb and AmSoxB1 transcripts are
detected only in the presumptive ectoderm while AmSoxE1 transcription is restricted to the
presumptive endoderm, suggesting that these Sox genes might play roles in germ layer specification.
A third type B Sox gene, AmSoxBa, and a Sox F gene AmSoxF also have complex and specific
expression patterns during early development. Each of these genes has a clear Nematostella
ortholog, but in several cases the expression pattern observed in Acropora differs significantly from
that reported in Nematostella.
Conclusion: These differences in expression patterns between Acropora and Nematostella largely
reflect fundamental differences in developmental processes, underscoring the diversity of
mechanisms within the anthozoan Sub-Class Hexacorallia (Zoantharia).

Background
Sox genes encode a family of transcription factors that are
defined by the presence of an HMG box resembling that
of the human testis determinant, SRY. Sox transcription
factors are restricted to the animal kingdom, but are
highly diversified and widely distributed within it. Mouse
and man have 20 Sox genes [1] whereas the model invertebrates Caenorhabditis and Drosophila have much less
extensive Sox repertoires (5 and 8 genes respectively; [24]). Despite the diversity and heterogeneity of Sox genes,
there are some cases of apparent orthology between Drosophila and mammals. For example, the similarity in HMG
box sequences of group B1 Sox genes between Drosophila
and vertebrates, and the linkage of Dichaete (a putative
group B2 Sox gene) to the B1 type gene SoxNeuro in Drosophila suggests the possibility that this organization dates
back to the common bilaterian ancestor [5]. Sox genes
have also been identified in the genomes of the placozoan
Trichoplax, sponges, ctenophores and cnidarians [6-10].
In the most extensive evolutionary analysis to date [2], ten
Sox groups (A-J) are recognized based on HMG domain
sequences as well as structural characteristics such as
intron-exon organization. Some of these groups have a
wide phylogenetic distribution (SoxB-F), whereas others
are restricted to specific lineages (SoxA and G-I to vertebrates; SoxJ to Caenorhabditis). The HMG domain
sequences (79 amino acid residues) are generally very
similar within a Sox group, but across deep phylogenetic
divides (such as between Drosophila and vertebrates), the
remainder of the protein sequence varies much more.
However, between different vertebrate species, there is
typically more extensive overall similarity between members of the same Sox group; not only are the HMG
domains similar, but other functional domains are conserved and sometimes diagnostic for specific Sox groups/
subgroups. Where members of the same Sox group have
common features beyond the HMG domain, this conservation tends to correlate with similarity of function [2].
Sox genes play a variety of developmental roles, many of
which are taxon-specific. Such functions include the role
in which Sox genes were originally identified – testis determination by SRY – a function conserved only amongst
eutherian mammals [11,12]. In a few specific cases, however, functions of particular Sox types/subtypes appear to
be conserved between vertebrates and Drosophila. For
example, group B Sox genes are expressed in developing
neural tissues in a wide range of animals [4], and functional analyses imply that members of this group play
central roles in early neuroectoderm differentiation in
Drosophila and vertebrates [13-15]. In both Xenopus and
Drosophila, SoxB1 type genes (Sox2 and SoxNeuro respectively) are essential for secondary steps of neural differentiation; and these are down- and up-regulated by the TGFb

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/311

superfamily growth factor dpp/BMP4 and its inhibitor sog/
Chordin [14,16]. Group B Sox genes are also expressed in
neural tissues in other invertebrates, including amphioxus, hemichordates, ascidians and molluscs [17-21].
Taken together, these lines of evidence suggest that the
involvement of group B Sox genes in early nervous system
development may be an ancestral characteristic in the
Bilateria. In addition to roles in the nervous system, group
B Sox genes function in germ layer differentiation during
early embryogenesis in both vertebrates and invertebrates.
For example, Sox3 (group B) genes regulate gastrulation
and germ layer formation in Xenopus and zebrafish [22],
and in the sea urchin, maternal SoxB1 and B2 are required
for gastrulation and vegetal development [23].
As anthozoan cnidarians are traditionally considered to
be amongst the simplest animals at the tissue level of
organization and have the simplest known nervous systems, they are an important comparator for establishing
ancestral roles of genes and understanding the evolution
of metazoan gene families. Earlier surveys [6,9] have demonstrated unexpected Sox gene diversity in non-Bilaterians, some diversification having occurred prior to the
sponge divergence, and more extensive expansion predating the cnidarian divergence. Four Sox genes have been
reported from the sponge Amphimedon (formerly Reniera;
[7,8]), and a total of fourteen sequences from the sea
anemone Nematostella vectensis [9]. Demosponge
sequences fall into the B, C and E/F Sox type clades in the
analyses of Jager et al. [6]; the analyses presented by Magie
et al. [9] place the Nematostella genes into a total of six of
the ten recognized Sox types. It is becoming clear that, like
other animals (e.g. [24]), Nematostella has undergone secondary gene loss; for example, in the Forkhead transcription factor family [25]. Data for other cnidarians are
therefore required to better understand the evolution of
metazoan gene families such as the Sox genes. To this end,
we have characterized Sox genes from a second anthozoan
cnidarian, the staghorn coral Acropora millepora. These
include members of the SoxB, C, E and F types; evaluation
of all of the available data suggests that the SoxA, D, G, H,
I and J types are restricted to the Bilateria. Some of the
Acropora Sox genes are expressed in patterns that are consistent with roles in early germ layer development, and the
SoxC gene is expressed in presumed sensory neurons.
Acropora and Nematostella are often considered "close" relatives and, as they belong to the same Sub-Class (Hexacorallia) within the cnidarian Class Anthozoa, similar gene
expression patterns might be expected. However, this is
not always the case – the expression patterns of several of
the Acropora Sox genes differ substantially from those of
their likely orthologs in Nematostella. This apparent paradox is, however, largely a consequence of morphological
differences and divergent developmental mechanisms
between the coral and sea anemone. Given their extensive

developmental diversity [26], we should not be surprised
to find many such examples among cnidarians.

Results
The Acropora Sox gene complement
Full-length cDNAs encoding two Sox proteins (AmSoxBb
and AmSoxB1) were identified during the course of an
ongoing Acropora EST project [27,28]. Four other Acropora
Sox genes were identified by a PCR-based approach.
Redundant PCR primers (designed from an alignment of
HMG domains of a range of Sox proteins) allowed the
generation of four novel Acropora PCR products, and for
each of these, full-length cDNAs were isolated by library
screening. Based on domain structure and phylogenetic
analyses, these six Sox genes were classified as AmSoxB1
(Genbank # EU784831, Additional File 1), AmSoxBa
(Genbank # EU784832, Additional File 2), AmSoxBb
(Genbank # EU784833, Additional File 3), AmSoxC (Genbank # EU784834, Additional File 4), AmSoxE1 (Genbank
# EU784835, Additional File 5) and AmSoxF (Genbank #
EU784836, Additional File 6). Each of these genes has a
clear Nematostella homolog (Fig. 1 and Additional Files 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6); AmSoxBa is orthologous with NvSoxB2, and
AmSoxBb with NvSox3.

Phylogenetic analysis based on the HMG domain (Fig. 1)
resolved bilaterian Sox proteins into Types B-F, supporting previous analyses (e.g. [2]), and four of these five
major Sox groups were strongly supported (> 90% bootstrap support). Five of the six Acropora Sox proteins fell
into these clades, the sole exception being Acropora SoxC,
which is discussed below; moreover the clade consisting
of bilaterian SoxC proteins has only moderate (57%)
bootstrap support. Although Acropora has Sox genes that
are clearly of the SoxB type (Fig. 1), the relationship of the
non-Bilaterian SoxB genes with the bilaterian SoxB1 and
SoxB2 clades is not simple. The analysis shown implies
that the bilaterian SoxB2 type arose after the cnidarian/
bilaterian split (Fig. 1, inset). One of the Acropora SoxB
proteins, AmSoxB1, and its likely Nematostella ortholog
(NvSoxB1) form a sister clade to all of the bilaterian SoxB
sequences. To avoid confusion with bilaterian SoxB2
orthologs, we refer to the Acropora ortholog of Nematostella "NvSoxB2" as AmSoxBa. The HMG domains
encoded by AmSoxBa and AmSoxBb, as well as their
Nematostella orthologs (NvSoxB2 and NvSox3), carry a
single amino acid (K or R, respectively) residue insertion
(at position 75 in Additional File 7) and, together with the
sponge gene AmqSOXB2, these four anthozoan sequences
form a sister clade to all of the other SoxB proteins. Inclusion of the full complement of human Sox HMG domains
(Additional File 8) does not alter the implied relationships between sequences from non-Bilateria, but
decreases support for some nodes within the tree.

To better understand evolutionary relationships of the
Acropora Sox repertoire, the domain structures of the predicted Acropora Sox proteins were compared with their
counterparts from chordates and protostome invertebrates (Fig. 2, Additional Files 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). In these
comparisons, the similarities between the Acropora Sox
proteins and their vertebrate homologs are striking,
whereas the members of these Sox families from invertebrates (fly, nematode, ascidian) are often less similar at
the level of domain structure; see, for example, the Acropora members of the SoxE and SoxF groups (Fig. 2). For
group E, a conserved region located just N-terminal of the
HMG domain (Fig. 2) is observed in AmSoxE1 and several
conserved regions are located just C-terminal of the HMG
domain of AmSoxE1. The conserved short motif EF(D/
E)QYL in the C-terminal region of group F genes is essential for transcriptional activation [29]. This motif is completely conserved in AmSoxE1 and AmSoxF proteins (Fig.
2, Additional Files 5 and 6), suggesting that AmSoxE1 and
AmSoxF may also function as transcriptional activators.
The Acropora group B Sox proteins (AmSoxBa, AmSoxBb
and AmSoxB1) each contain a group B-specific motif
located immediately C-terminal of the HMG domain (Fig.
2 SoxB, Additional Files 1, 2, 3). In addition, the
AmSoxB1 protein contains two other domains characteristic of the SoxB1 sub-type (Fig. 2 SoxB), one of which has
been shown to have transcriptional activation properties
[30], implying that AmSoxB1 may also be able to activate
transcription.
Despite not being within the SoxC clade in the phylogenetic analysis of HMG box sequences (Fig. 1), the
AmSoxC protein is strikingly similar to vertebrate SoxC
proteins in terms of its overall domain structure (Fig. 2
SoxC, Additional File 4). In addition to the HMG box, two
other motifs that are characteristic of vertebrate SoxC proteins are also present in the C-terminal region of the
AmSoxC protein; one of these has a predicted transactivation function [2,31], consistent with a function in a transcriptional activation for AmSoxC. Note that these
domains could not be identified in a wide range of other
invertebrate SoxC proteins. The overall structural similarities between AmSoxC and vertebrate SoxC proteins support the classification of the former as a member of Sox
group C, despite only moderate support from phylogenetic analysis of the HMG domain (Fig. 1).
Acropora SoxB and SoxE genes are expressed in the
presumptive ectoderm and endoderm, respectively, during
gastrulation
The spatial expression patterns of AmSoxBb and AmSoxB1
during early embryogenesis are very similar. Maternal
AmSoxBb and AmSoxB1 transcripts are uniformly distrib-

uted in the unfertilized egg (not shown), and early cleaving (Fig. 3A, G), and "prawn-chip" embryos (not shown).
At the initiation of gastrulation (late "prawn-chip" stage),
AmSoxBb and AmSoxB1 transcripts become depleted in the
presumptive endoderm (Fig. 3B, H). In early gastrulae
(early "donut" stage; 20 h), the SoxB transcripts are clearly
restricted to the presumptive ectoderm (Fig. 3C, D, I, J)
and this restriction is maintained until gastrulation is
complete (Fig. 3E, K). By contrast, AmSoxE1 transcripts
cannot be detected in unfertilized eggs or early cleaving
embryos, implying that AmSoxE1 transcripts are not provided maternally (Fig. 3M). AmSoxE1 transcripts are first
detected in the presumptive endoderm at the early
"donut" stage (Fig. 3O). During gastrulation, AmSoxE1
expression is maintained specifically in the presumptive
endoderm (Fig. 3Q), thus throughout gastrulation the
SoxB and SoxE genes specifically mark the presumptive
ectoderm and endoderm respectively. AmSoxE1 expression remains endodermal throughout larval and early
post-settlement development (data not shown).
AmSoxC is expressed in putative sensory neurons
AmSoxC mRNA was not detected in unfertilized eggs or
early cleaving embryos (Fig. 4A); transcripts were first
detected at the "prawn-chip" stage. AmSoxC is initially
expressed in scattered cells in the presumptive ectoderm
(Fig. 4B). Slightly later, transcription appears be restricted
to a more uniformly distributed subset of cells throughout
the presumptive ectoderm during gastrulation. This cellspecific expression first becomes apparent in the early
donut stage (Fig. 4C, D; 20 h). Expression is restricted to
individual ectodermal cells throughout gastrulation (Fig.
4E, F), and this pattern is maintained throughout larval
development (Fig. 4G–J) and continues after settlement.
At the planula stage, in addition to the cell specific expression, more generalized AmSoxC expression is detected in
the outer ectoderm around the oral pore (Fig. 4I, J). In the
post-settlement stage, although the expression of AmSoxC
in the oral pore is still maintained, the number of AmSoxC
expressing cells decreases (Fig. 4K). The significance of the
oral expression is unclear.

At higher magnification (Fig. 5), the morphologies of the
ectodermal cells expressing AmSoxC are revealed. These
cells are thin and bipolar with the cell body located midway across the ectoderm (Fig. 5A) and cytoplasmic projections extending to both of its borders. In some cases,
AmSoxC expressing cells are connected by thin cytoplasmic projections (Fig. 5A). The morphology of some of
these AmSoxC expressing cells is consistent with that of
'type 1' sensory neurons, one of two presumed neuron
classes identified by immunostaining with antibodies
directed against the cnidarian neuropeptide RFamide
[32,33].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/311

One way of testing the prediction that AmSoxC is
expressed in neurons is to compare its expression pattern
with that of other genes that are unlikely to be expressed
there. One such highly expressed gene is Amlipase, which
codes for an enzyme unlikely to be abundant in neurons
but likely to be present in gland cells, which form an
important component of the ectoderm. To further investigate the identity of the AmSoxC expressing cells double in
situ hybridization studies were carried out using AmSoxC
and Amlipase (Fig. 5B, C); cells expressing Amlipase were
visualised using Sigma Fast Red (red) and those expressing AmSoxC stained using NBT/BCIP (purple/black). As
can be seen in Fig. 5B, C, the two probes stain mutually
exclusive cell populations, indicating that Amlipase and
AmSoxC are not co-expressed. These expression data are
consistent with the hypothesis that the AmSoxC-expressing cells may constitute a neural cell type.
Nematostella has a clearly orthologous gene (NvSoxC; Fig.
1) whose expression pattern has not previously been
reported. This gene is expressed in a broadly similar pattern to its Acropora counterpart throughout development
(Fig. 6), but some differences were apparent. For example,
in contrast to the situation in Acropora, Nematostella
NvSoxC transcripts were not detected at the blastula or
gastrula stages, but were first detected at the late gastrula/
very early planula stage, in the margin of the oral pore. At
the planula stage, in addition to the maintenance of the
early (oral pore margin) expression pattern, NvSoxC is
expressed in individual cells in the ectoderm (Fig. 6D–F).
As development progresses, the expression surrounding
the oral pore is altered to where the tentacle buds are initiated (Fig. 6G, H), though the ectodermal cell specific
expression is still maintained. In the metamorphosing
planula, the ectodermal cell specific expression is no
longer detected (Fig. 6I). In the primary polyp, the expression in the tentacle buds persists and NvSoxC expression
is detected in the ectoderm of the pharynx (Fig. 6J–L).
Expression analysis of AmSoxBa and AmSoxF
Unlike the other Acropora B type Sox genes, AmSoxBa transcripts could not be detected in unfertilized eggs, or in
early cleaving and prawn-chip stage embryos, indicating
that AmSoxBa is not a maternal transcript (Fig. 7A).
Expression of AmSoxBa is first detected at the late prawnchip stage (Fig. 7B), which corresponds to the time at
which gastrulation begins. AmSoxBa transcripts appear in
the presumptive ectoderm with some cell specific staining. During gastrulation, the general ectodermal expression and some cell specific staining persist (Fig. 7C). After
completion of gastrulation, AmSoxBa exhibits cell specific
ectodermal expression in the pear and planula stages (Fig.
7E–H). The nuclei of AmSoxBa expressing cells are located
centrally or closer to the surface of the ectoderm. The cells
are thin with several projections extending from the core

restricted to the aboral ectoderm (Fig. 7I, J). After metamorphosis, AmSoxBa is expressed throughout the entire
ectoderm (Fig. 7K, L) except in the regions around the
polyp base (Fig. 7L).
AmSoxF transcripts could not be detected in unfertilized
eggs, in early cleaving embryos (Fig. 8A), prawnchip or
donut stages (during gastrulation; Fig. 8B), consistent
with RT-PCR (not shown). AmSoxF expression is first
detectable at the pre-pear stage (Fig. 8C, D); during the
pear stage, AmSoxF is expressed throughout the entire
endoderm (Fig. 8E), and this pattern persists until after
settlement (Fig. 8F–J).

Discussion
Comparison of the Acropora and Nematostella Sox
complements
Each of the six Acropora Sox genes reported has a clear
counterpart in Nematostella, and these pairs of genes are
probable orthologs. A total of 14 Sox sequences has been
reported from Nematostella [9], so presumably more Acropora genes will be discovered as a result of continuing
transcript characterisation using 454 sequencing. However, most of the Nematostella genes without Acropora
counterparts (NvSoxA, NvSoxE2, NvSoxF2, NvSoxJ,

NvSox4, NvSox5) were predicted from genomic sequence
data so their existence as functional transcripts remains
unproven. In our analyses (Fig. 1), three of the Nematostella Sox genes (NvSox1, NvSox2, NvSox3) that were unassigned in the Magie et al. study [9] fell clearly within the
SoxB clade. Factors contributing to these differences, and
the significantly higher resolution in our analysis, include
the deliberate exclusion of highly divergent bilaterian
sequences and the use of only complete HMG domain
sequences in our case.
Anthozoan Sox genes and the evolutionary divergence of
the Sox family
Sox genes have previously been reported from both cnidarians and sponges [6-9] but, as a number of these surveys have been based on PCR screens or scanning
genomic resources, pseudogenes may have been included
and in some cases assignments have been based on
incomplete HMG domain sequences. The analyses presented here are based on complete HMG domain data
derived from cDNAs, overcoming previous limitations. In
terms of the representation of the ten (A-J) recognized
classes of Sox genes, our studies confirm the presence of
group B, C, E and F Sox types in cnidarians, and are consistent with the absence of group D, G, H, and I as
reported by Magie et al. [9]. However, in our analyses

Nematostella genes previously assigned to groups A and J
fell into group B (Additional File 9) in agreement with [6].
The strong bootstrap support (≥ 90%) for monophyly of
Sox groups B, E and F in our analyses (Fig. 1) indicates
that each of these (and probably also the SoxC type) were
distinct in the common ancestor of cnidarians and bilaterians, and the assignment of sponge genes to the Sox B, F,
and C classes in our analyses implies that these classes had
already diverged in Urmetazoa (the common ancestor of
all animals), consistent with [6]. Hence our analysis is
broadly consistent with that in a recent study of the Sox
gene complement of the sponge Amphimedon [8].
According to our analyses none of the cnidarian Sox
sequences fall into subgroup B2, the distinctness of which
is well supported (79%) by bootstrap probability, and the
relationship of the non-bilaterian sequences to subgroup

B1 is not simple (Fig. 1). It appears that Sox group B2 of
the Bilateria may have arisen from a B1-like precursor
after the Cnidaria/Bilateria divergence. However, the
extent to which the phylogeny might be biased by the
presence of an extra amino acid residue in two of the Acropora HMG domains (and their Nematostella counterparts)
is not yet clear. Therefore, although the tree presented
here (Fig. 1) contradicts the conclusions of Larroux et al.
[8] with respect to divergence within the Sox B class, relationships between the SoxB1 and SoxB2 types remain
unresolved. The additional amino acid residue in the
HMG domains of two Acropora Sox proteins and their
likely Nematostella orthologs, a lysine residue in the case
of AmSoxBa and NvSoxB2 and an arginine residue in
AmSoxBb and NvSox3, is thus far unique to these group B
genes, and its origin may post-date the Cnidaria/Bilateria
split.

these genes in germ-layer specification. Although often
referred to as neural markers [4], members of Sox group B
are also important for germ layer formation and gastrulation in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Sox3 (a group
B1 gene) regulates gastrulation and germ layer formation
in both Xenopus and zebrafish [22]. In the sea urchin,
SoxB1 and B2 are expressed in the presumptive ectoderm
during gastrulation and are necessary for gastrulation and
vegetal development [23]. In the hemichordate Saccoglossus kowalevskii, Sox1/2/3 (a SoxB gene) is expressed in the
entire ectoderm of the gastrula embryo [19]. These similarities suggest an ancestral function of group B Sox genes
in germ layer specification. The significance of the
AmSoxE1 expression pattern is more difficult to assess, as
few early SoxE expression patterns have been reported.
Roles for Sox9 (group E) genes in neural crest development [34-36] presumably reflect co-option.

In terms of HMG domain sequences, sizes and protein
domain structures, the Acropora Sox proteins are strikingly
similar to the vertebrate members of each of these Sox
groups, whereas more differences are apparent in vertebrate/Drosophila and vertebrate/Caenorhabditis comparisons. This implies that, as is the case for some other genes
[27], vertebrate and cnidarian Sox genes may more closely
reflect ancestral characteristics than do their fly and worm
counterparts. However, in some respects, the structures of
the sponge Sox proteins [7] differ substantially from their
cnidarian and bilaterian counterparts. The sponge
sequences are more divergent in the HMG domains, lack
other obvious conserved domains, and differ in overall
size and position of the HMG domain. It is unclear, however, whether these differences reflect divergence within
the sponge lineage or innovations within the cnidarian/
bilaterian lineage potentially underpinning the transition
to tissue level organization.
Expression patterns of Acropora Sox genes – glimpses of
ancestral functions?
The restriction of the Acropora SoxBb and SoxB1 mRNAs to
the presumptive ectoderm and SoxE1 to the presumptive
endoderm during gastrulation is suggestive of roles for

Zygotic AmSoxE1 expression starts from the late prawnchip or early donut stage, and this gene marks the presumptive endoderm during gastrulation (Fig.3). Although
this is suggestive of a role for AmSoxE1 in endoderm determination, there are no clear precedents for this. In the sea
urchin, SoxE transcripts are localized in small micromere
descendents at the tip of the archenteron during gastrulation [37], but this gene is not expressed in the blastula
stage. However, few comparative expression patterns have
been reported, and more general roles for SoxE genes in
early tissue patterning cannot yet be ruled out. Although
AmSoxF is not expressed until after gastrulation (Fig. 8),
expression is limited to the endoderm, so it is possible
that AmSoxF plays a role in the maintenance of endodermal identity.
Heterogeneity in early Sox expression patterns within the
Anthozoa
Although Acropora and Nematostella are both members of
the same subclass (Hexacorallia, or Zoantharia) within
the cnidarian Class Anthozoa there are apparent differences in the expression patterns of presumably orthologous genes. Some of these differences may just reflect the
more complete series of early developmental time points
reported for Acropora, while others presumably result from
fundamental differences in the overall developmental
biology of the anemone and the coral (see [38,39]).

The early development of Nematostella is now well documented up to blastopore closure, although some details of
the mechanism of gastrulation remain equivocal [9,4042]. Later development is less well understood with the
most complete description still being that of Hand and
Uhlinger [43]. Acropora development has been characterised much less thoroughly although it is clear that there
are some dramatic differences between the two species
[44,45]. Firstly, it appears that the Acropora egg contains

much more yolk than that of Nematostella, consistent with
the frequently longer planktonic life of the former species.
Secondly, the prawn-chip stage is more exaggerated in
Acropora, in that many more cells are present at this stage,
so that the embryo takes on the appearance of a warped
dinner plate, rather than a small bowl. The morphology of
the post-gastrulation larva in the two species is also quite
different due to the large amount of yolk present in Acropora. Thus the Nematostella planula has a far more developed endoderm and structures such as the septa are
apparent from shortly after blastopore closure. In contrast, the early Acropora planula has a poorly developed
endoderm consisting of a thin layer of cells lying beneath
the mesogloea plus small cells scattered among the large
yolk cells that pack the cylindrical central axis of the larva.
It is only late in planula development that the tightly

packed core of yolk begins to thin at the oral end and septal development becomes apparent. These morphological
differences mean that even when a gene is functioning in
a similar manner its pattern of expression may appear
somewhat different.
Magie et al. [9] comment that NvSox3 is the only Nematostella Sox gene that is highly expressed maternally. Its Acropora ortholog, AmSoxBb (Fig. 3G–L) is also expressed in
the egg and in early stages of embryonic cell division. A
second Acropora gene, AmSoxB1, is also maternal, as evidenced by detection of the mRNA from the earliest stages
of development (Fig. 3A), and has a very similar pattern of
expression to AmSoxBb. The earliest stage at which expression of NvSoxB1 (the ortholog of AmSoxB1) is shown by
Magie et al. [9] is the gastrula, when its mRNA is restricted

to the aboral ectoderm and a discrete area around the
blastopore which will give rise to the pharynx. Sox E may
be an example of the phenomenon noted above, where
orthologs may function similarly in spite of initial expression patterns that appear quite different. Thus, early
expression in Nematostella appears to be ectodermal while
in Acropora it is clear that the expression will clearly
become endodermal much earlier. However, by the end of
gastrulation the expression is endodermal in both organisms so the way this expression is arrived at may not be
functionally significant.

well before the blastopore has closed while expression of
NvSoxC begins later – expression of the anemone gene
could not be detected during gastrulation. A second difference is that expression associated with the oral pore
appears just after the blastopore has closed in Nematostella
(Fig. 6), while in Acropora this is not seen prior to the planula stage. Finally, while NvSoxC is clearly expressed in
developing tentacles in Nematostella (Fig. 6J–L), no such
expression is seen in Acropora at comparable (i.e. later in
development) stages of tentacular development (not
shown).

The cell-specific expression pattern of NvSoxC, the Nematostella ortholog of AmSoxC, in the ectoderm is broadly
similar to that of the Acropora gene. However, there are
obvious differences. Firstly, expression begins in Acropora

The expression pattern of NvSoxC reported here (Fig. 6)
has some striking similarities with that previously
reported for another Nematostella Sox gene, the B type gene
NvSox2 [9]. Like NvSoxC, NvSox2 is expressed in a subset

of ectodermal cells that are distributed in a scattered pattern early in post-gastrulation development but become
restricted to the ends of the developing tentacles later; the
similarity is most striking at the stage shown as Fig. 6H –
compare this pattern for NvSoxC with Fig. 3ll in Magie et
al. [9] for NvSox2. Unfortunately, direct comparisons are
limited by the fact that no NvSox2 in situ data are available
for the period corresponding to Fig. 6D–G. Note that the
two Nematostella genes are on separate scaffolds in
genome assembly v1.0 (JGI) so it is unlikely that they are
tightly linked.
Direct comparisons of expression patterns later in development are complicated by the more extensive differences
between Nematostella and Acropora (e.g. the incomplete
metamorphosis of the anemone). Whilst AmSoxBa and
NvSoxB2 have similar cell-specific expression patterns
throughout gastrulation, in Acropora this ectodermal pattern persists through to the planula stage (Fig. 7), whereas
NvSoxB2 is expressed in a cell-specific manner in both
endoderm and ectoderm [7]. Immediately prior to settlement, expression of AmSoxBa becomes restricted to the
aboral half of the ectoderm (Fig. 7), but nothing like this
axial restriction is seen during Nematostella development
before tentacle formation.

Conclusion
The short and manipulable [43,46] life cycle of Nematostella, as well as its position as the first cnidarian with a
fully sequenced genome, have led it to prominence as a
representative of the large and diverse phylum Cnidaria.
Because Nematostella appears to have retained much of the
ancestral complexity of some gene classes (for example,
the TGFb and Wnt signaling molecules; [28,47]), there is

an assumption that by comparison of its gene repertoire
and expression patterns with higher animals ancestral
characteristics can be inferred. However, Nematostella has
apparently also undergone significant gene loss in some
gene families – extensive losses in the case of the Fox transcription factor family [25] – and even between Acropora
and Nematostella, both members of the anthozoan subclass Hexacorallia (Zoantharia), the expression patterns of
orthologous genes appear to differ significantly. Whilst
these latter differences may often simply reflect divergent
patterns of development, they underscore the need for
comparative data for other cnidarians – ancestral characteristics can be inferred with much greater confidence
when the inference is based on multiple representatives.
Given their diversity of developmental programs, this
principle is likely to be particularly significant in the case
of phylum Cnidaria.

Methods
Animal sampling
Eggs and embryos of Acropora millepora were collected at
Magnetic Island (Latitude 19°09' South; Longitude
146°49' East) and Orpheus Island (Latitude 18°28'
South; Longitude 146°25' East) during the coral massspawning events of 2004, 2005 and 2006.
Isolation of Sox genes from Acropora millepora
Two Sox genes (AmSoxBb and AmSoxB1) were isolated during the Acropora millepora EST projects [27,28]. In order to
search for more Sox genes, RT-PCR amplification of the
highly conserved HMG domain of Sox genes from Acropora was attempted. First strand cDNAs from different
embryonic stages were used as an RT-PCR template.
Degenerate primers were designed based on highly con-

served regions of the HMG domain. Primer sequences
were; SoxFw (5'-CCNATGAAYGCNTTYATNGTNTGG-3')
and SoxRv (5'-GGNYKRTAYTTRTART-YNGG-3'), corresponding to the amino acid sequences PMNAF(M/I)VW
and P(N/D)YKY(Q/R/K)P. PCR conditions were as follows: 94°C for 30 second, 42°C for 30 second, 72°C for
30 second (5 cycles) and then 94°C for 30 second, 50°C
for 30 second, 72°C for 30 second (35 cycles). DNA fragments of the expected size (208 bp) were cloned into
pGEM-T vector (Promega) and sequenced either using the
ET Dynamic sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences) or
by Macrogen Inc. (Seoul, South Korea). Novel Sox gene
fragments were subsequently used as probes for cDNA
library screening. The l-UniZap XR A. millepora cDNA
library was constructed using messenger RNA from adult
coral tips. cDNA library screening was carried out as
described in Miller et al. [48].
Phylogenetic analysis
In the case of the vertebrate sox proteins, relatedness in
the HMG domain is a good indicator of overall relatedness [2]. Full length HMG domain sequences (79 amino
acids) encoded by the Sox genes of Acropora and other animals were aligned by ClustalW prior to Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic analyses in MOLPHY version 2.3 [49]
using the Dayhoff model of protein evolution and local
rearrangement of the Neighbor-joining tree. In the case of
non-bilaterian Sox genes, only those for which cDNAs
encoding complete HMG domains have been identified
were used for phylogenetic analysis [6,9]. Genes have
been named consistent with [2]. Where other names are
in common use they are indicated in brackets [e.g.
DmSoxB2-1 (Dichaete)]. The resulting tree was rooted
using established outgroups; red bread mold Neurospora
crassa MATA1, yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe MC,
STE11, Mus musculus TCF1, LEF1 [50], and Hydra vulgaris
Tcf [51].
Fixation and whole mount in situ hybridization of coral
embryos
Acropora millepora embryos were processed as described by
Anctil et al. [52] up to BCIP/NBT color development.
Color development was then stopped by washing several
times with PBT, and the backgrounds cleared in ethanol.

For double in situ hybridization of AmSoxC and the Acropora lipase gene (Amlipase; Genbank # EU770585) the
Amlipase gene was labeled with fluorescein using Fluorescein Labeling Mix (Roche). Because the expression of
AmSoxC is much weaker than that of Amlipase, embryos
were incubated with AmSoxC DIG-probe overnight, and
then fluorescein labeled Amlipase probe was added to the
hybridization solution with hybridization continuing for
24 hours after addition. The DIG-labeled AmSoxC cRNA

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/311

probe was detected using a 1:1500 dilution of anti-DIG
antibody followed by development in BCIP/NBT and
background removal by washing in ethanol. The AP-conjugated anti-DIG-antibody was then fully removed by
washing with 100 mM glycine·HCl, pH2.2, 10 minutes at
room temperature, followed by several washes in PBT.
Finally fluorescein-labeled Amlipase probe was detected
using a 1:800 dilution of AP-conjugated anti-fluorescein
antibody (Roche) followed by development with Sigma
Fast Red (Sigma). The stained embryos were mounted in
80% glycerol and kept at 4°C. Images were captured with
a SPOT digital camera and processed using Adobe Photoshop.
Whole mount in situ hybridization of Nematostella
vectensis
For synthesis of the NvSoxC DIG-labeled RNA probe, the
NvSoxC nucleotide fragment was amplified by PCR from
a Nematostella vectensis genomic library. Primers for
NvSoxC were designed based on the predicted ORF nucleotide sequence. Primer sequences were as follows:
NvSoxC-Fw, 5'-CTAGTGATGATGATGGTGCTA-CAG-3',
NvSoxC-Rv, 5'-CAGGCTGACCGTATCGAG-3'. PCR conditions were as follows: 94°C for 30 seconds, 50°C for 30
seconds, 72°C for 30 seconds (35 cycles). DNA fragments
of the expected size (981 bp) were cloned into the pGEMT Easy Vector (Promega). The plasmid template was linearised by cutting with NcoI, and SP6 RNA polymerase
used for RNA probe synthesis. The published in situ
hybridization protocol [53] was followed with the following modifications. Fixed animals were rehydrated from
70% ethanol, treated with 20 μg/ml proteinase K for 15
min, washed repeatedly in PBT, and then refixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde for 20 min. Following several PBT
washes, the embryos were transferred into hybridization
solution and treated as described above for Acropora.
Hybridization was at 42°C for 72 h. Free probe was
removed by several washes in hybridization wash solution at 50°C. Probe detection, color development and
image capture were as described above. Determination of
Nematostella developmental stages was based on Hand
and Uhlinger [43].
