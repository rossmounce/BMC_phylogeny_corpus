Abstract
Cellulosimicrobium cellulans (also known with the synonyms Cellulomonas cellulans, Oerskovia
xanthineolytica, and Arthrobacter luteus) is an actinomycete that excretes yeast cell wall lytic enzyme
complexes containing endo-β-1,3-glucanases [EC 3.2.1.39 and 3.2.1.6] as key constituents. Three
genes encoding endo-β-1,3-glucanases from two C. cellulans strains have been cloned and
characterised over the past years. The βglII and βglIIA genes from strain DSM 10297 (also known as
O. xanthineolytica LL G109) encoded proteins of 40.8 and 28.6 kDa, respectively, whereas the β-1,3glucanase gene from strain ATCC 21606 (also known as A. luteus 73–14) encoded a 54.5 kDa
protein. Alignment of their deduced amino acid sequences reveal that βglII and βglIIA have catalytic
domains assigned to family 16 of glycosyl hydrolases, whereas the catalytic domain from the 54.5
kDa glucanase belongs to family 64. Notably, both βglII and the 54.5 kDa β-1,3-glucanase are
multidomain proteins, having a lectin-like C-terminal domain that has been assigned to family 13 of
carbohydrate binding modules, and that confers to β-1,3-glucanases the ability to lyse viable yeast
cells. Furthermore, βglII may also undergo posttranslational proteolytic processing of its C-terminal
domain, resulting in a truncated enzyme retaining its glucanase activity but with very low yeast-lytic
activity. In this review, the diversity in terms of structural and functional characteristics of the C.
cellulans β-1,3-glucanases has been compiled and compared.

Review
Several bacteria have been reported to be able to lyse and
grow on viable yeast and fungal cells by producing a variety of cell-wall degrading enzymes such as endo-β-1,3-glucanases, proteases, β-1,6-glucanases, mannanases, and
chitinases. The structural complexity of the yeast cell wall,
which is mainly composed of complex polymers of β-1,3and β-1,6-glucans, mannoproteins, and smaller amounts
of chitin [1,2], implies that the synergistic action of these
enzymes is necessary to hydrolyse its components into
assimilable substrates. Nevertheless, endo-β-1,3-gluca-

nases [EC 3.2.1.39 and EC 3.2.1.6] have been considered
to play a major role in yeast cell lysis [2,3].
The actinomycete Cellulosimicrobium cellulans (also known
with the synonyms Cellulomonas cellulans, Oerskovia xanthineolytica, and Arthrobacter luteus), has been regarded as
a major source of yeast-lytic enzymes, particularly endo-β1,3-glucanases, proteases and mannanases. Notably, several commercially available yeast-lytic glucanases preparations derived from this organism, namely Lyticase,
Zymolyase, and Quantazyme, have been widely used for
yeast protoplast preparation and yeast DNA isolation.

Endo-β-1,3-glucanases are the major component of such
enzyme preparations. Only one of these commercially
available preparations (Quantazyme, Quantum Biotechnology, Canada) is produced recombinantly and protease-free. Besides their application in spheroplasting, C.
cellulans β-1,3-glucanases have shown their big potential
in a wide range of applications in both basic research and
biotechnology; for instance, in structural analyses of the
yeast and fungal cell wall [4,5], in cell wall permeabilisation for the selective recombinant protein recovery from
yeast cells [6,7], or in biocatalysis [8-10], among others.
Early characterisation studies on the lytic enzyme system
from different C. cellulans strains showed that this organism excreted a wide heterogeneity of β-1,3-glucanase
forms with different physicochemical and functional
properties [11-15]. Notably, while all of the isolated
forms showed hydrolytic activity toward β-glucans (glucanase activity), only some were found capable of inducing
lysis of viable yeast cells (lytic activity).
The cloning and sequencing of three β-1,3-glucanaseencoding genes from C. cellulans has allowed for further
molecular and biochemical characterisation studies over
the past years. These studies have revealed the diversity in
terms of structural and functional characteristics of the C.
cellulans β-1,3-glucanases, which have been compiled and
compared in this review.

Origin of the multiplicity of β-1,3-glucanases isoforms
Over the past years, three genes encoding β-1,3-glucanases
from two different C. cellulans strains (ATCC 21606 and
DSM 10297) have been cloned and characterised (table
1), [16-20]. The βglII and βglIIA genes from strain DSM
10297 (formerly O. xanthineolytica LL-G109) encoded
mature proteins of 40.8 and 28.6 kDa, respectively,
whereas the β-1,3-glucanase gene from strain ATCC
21606 (formerly Arthrobacter luteus 73–14) encoded a
54.5 kDa protein. These studies revealed that the multiplicity of β-1,3-glucanase forms excreted by this organism
may be the result of the coexistence of multiple glucanaseencoding genes. In addition, there is strong evidence that
proteolytic processing of some of these enzymes may also
generate derivatives retaining β-1,3-glucanase activity. In
particular, the single molecular specie of the major β-1,3glucanase activity initially purified and characterised from
C. cellulans DSM 10297 cells growing on yeast glucan, had
a molecular weight of about 27.2 kDa, as determined by
mass spectrometry [21], and a pI of 4.85~5.0 [21]. However, the mature βglII deduced sequence is a 383 aa
polypeptide with a predicted molecular weight of 40,8
kDa and pI of 5.73 (as calculated with the sequence analysis tools at http://www.expasy.ch), comprising a larger
N-terminal catalytic domain and a C-terminal carbohydrate-binding domain of about 120 aa, as discussed
below. This suggested that the 27.2 kDa enzyme actually
corresponded to a C-terminal-truncated form of βglII

(βglIIt) generated after its post-secretional proteolytic
processing. This was corroborated by the fact that i) the
predicted 27.2 kDa proteolytic product derived from the
40.8 kDa βglII, which would correspond to a polypeptide
of about 250 residues and a calculated pI of 5.37, had a
deduced amino acid composition in concordance with
that experimentally determined for the purified native β1,3-glucanase [22]; ii) partial amino acid sequences of the
purified native β-1,3-glucanase were homologous to corresponding N-terminal and internal βglII sequences [17];
iii) the purified native 27.2 kDa β-1,3-glucanase had
higher affinity towards soluble β-1,3-glucan (laminarin)
than insoluble yeast β-glucan (and, therefore, very low
yeast-lytic activity) [22], and iv) heterologous expression
of βglII in Escherichia coli yielded two molecular forms: a
40- and a 27.2-kDa protein having β-1,3-glucanase activity, with a experimentally determined pI of 6.3 and 4.8,
respectively [20].
In contrast, only one gene could be isolated from a C. cellulans ATCC 21606 genomic library [16]. Nevertheless,
southern blot hybridization studies suggest that strain
ATCC 21606 also has a βglII-like gene [23].
Functional properties of C. cellulans β-1,3-glucanases
As discussed below, while the β-1,3-glucanase isolated
from strain ATCC 21606 has been classified in family 64
of glycosyl hydrolases (GH-64), β-1,3-glucanases from
strain DSM 10297 have been classified in family 16 of glycosyl hydrolases (GH-16), thus revealing an important
structural diversity [24,25]. This is further reflected in the
heterogeneity of C. cellulans functional characteristics:

Although all C. cellulans β-1,3-glucanases hydrolyse yeast
glucan in an endolytic manner, GH-16 β-1,3-glucanases
yield a mixture of biose and glucose [26], whereas GH-64
β-1,3-glucanases hydrolyse yeast glucan with predominant liberation of pentoses [15].
Enzymatic hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds occurs with two
possible stereochemical outcomes: inversion or retention
of the anomeric configuration at the site of cleavage.
'Inverting' enzymes utilise a single-displacement reaction
where an activated water molecule performs a nucleophilic attack at the sugar C-1 while concomitant aglycone departure is achieved by protonation of the glycosilic
oxygen. By contrast, 'retaining' enzymes utilise a doubledisplacement mechanism involving a covalent glycosylenzyme intermediate.
The stereochemistry of hydrolysis in family GH-64 β-1,3glucanases has been recently determined for one of its
members, a β-1,3-glucanase from Streptomyces matensis
[27]. Interestingly, while family GH-16 β-glucanases have
been shown to be 'retaining' enzymes [28], this GH-64

http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/5/1/10

enzyme is the first inverting β-1,3-glucanase characterised.
The inverting mechanism implies that the molecular
mechanism of hydrolysis by this enzyme does not involve
the formation of a covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate. Since the molecular mechanism has been shown to be
conserved within the families of glycoside hydrolases, it
can be concluded that family GH-64 glycoside hydrolases
may operate by an inverting mechanism [27].
The differences in "yeast-lytic" activity of the different β1,3-glucanases forms is reflected in their kinetic properties
(table 1). For instance, the 27.2 kDa βglIIt form (i.e. with
no carbohydrate binding module) has very low yeast lytic
activity; correspondingly, its Km for yeast glucan (insoluble) is higher than for the soluble substrate (laminarin).
In contrast, a β-1,3-glucanase with high lytic activity such
as the one from ATCC 21606 strain (having a C-terminal
carbohydrate-binding domain, as discussed below), has a
Km for yeast glucan lower than for laminarin [16]. Another
interesting observation concerns the possible effect of a
carbohydrate-binding domain in the catalytic properties
for soluble substrates of the catalytic domain is attached
to. In particular, the presence of a carbohydrate-binding
domain in the recombinant βglII seems to increase the Km
for laminarin in relation to the native βglIIt form (table
1), [20].
β-1,3-glucanase forms isolated from C. cellulans appear to
have a pH optimum in the range of 5.5 to 8 (depending
on the substrate), with the exception of the βglIIA enzyme
from strain DSM 10297, which seems to have an acidic
pH of about 4.0 [18]. It is also remarkable that the GH-16
β-1,3-glucanases from C. cellulans so far characterised
(βglII from strain DSM 10297 and the β-1,3-glucanase
from the strain known as O. xanthineolytica TK-1 [26])
have a moderately high optimum activity temperature
(table 1). However, only the native βglIIt enzyme has
been shown to have a significant thermotolerance (the
enzyme retained about 50% of its residual activity after
30' of incubation at 70°C, pH 7 [21]).
Sequence analysis of C. cellulans β-1,3-glucanases
Similarity searches using BLAST [29] at the National
Center for Biotechnology Information server [30],
showed that βglII is related to the GH-16 family, (see the
CAZy database, [31-33]). Sequence alignments with proteins of this family suggest that βglII comprises a catalytic
domain of ~240 aa, which is connected by a small glycine, serine- threonine- and proline-rich 23 aa-linker region to
a 120-aa C-terminal domain consisting of a tandem of
three imperfect repeats, R1, R2, and R3. This domain
shows high sequence similarities to a number of Carbohydrate-Binding Modules (CBMs) found in diverse glycosyl
hydrolases, as well as to several plant lectins (see updated
CBMs at the CAZy database, [31-33]). In contrast, βglIIA is

a non-modular enzyme, i.e. it only has a catalytic domain
[18] (figure 1). The βglII catalytic domain is highly similar
to βglIIA (80.3% sequence identity over a 245 aa overlap).
Interestingly, both isoenzymes seem to have different catalytic properties, e.g. different optimum pH of activity
(table 1). Also, βglII has homologous N-terminal amino
acid sequence (over the first 33 residues), as well as similar molecular weight and pI, to the yeast-lytic β-1,3-glucanase purified from the TK-1 strain (table 1) [26].
In contrast, the 380 aa catalytic domain of the yeast-lytic
54.5 kDa β-1,3-glucanase from C. cellulans ATCC 21606
[16], has been classified into GH-64 family. Interestingly,
this β-1,3-glucanase is a modular enzyme, having a C-terminal "lytic domain" of about 120 aa that falls into the
CBM family 13 (figure 1).
βglII shows the highest similarity values, ranging from
about 60 % to 40 % of sequence identity in 240 aa overlaps, to the GH-16 bacterial endo-1,3-β-glucanases (laminarinases) subfamily members, as well as to several nonbacterial β-1,3-glucan-acting proteins such as the β-1,3glucanase LamA from the archeon Pyrococcus furiosus
(GenBank accession number AF013169) [34], 49 % identity, the β-1,3-glucanase from Strongylocentrotus purpuratus
(sea urchin), (GenBank accession number U49711) [35],
36.6% identity, and to the α-subunit of the (1→3)β-Dglucan-sensitive coagulation factor G from Tachypleus tridentatus (horseshoe crab), (GenBank accession number
D16622) [36], 39.5% identity. Sequence identity values
between βglII and the GH-16 bacterial 1,3-1,4-β-glucan 4glucanohydrolases (lichenases) subfamily members are
somewhat lower (ca. 25%). Detailed similarity and phylogenetic analyses have been reported for GH-16 enzymes
[28,37]. Secondary structure analyses of the native 27.2
kDa βglIIt form revealed a high content of β-structure and

The sequence WPSSGEIDIME, which includes de catalytic
glutamate residues of the active site conserved within GH16 [38], was identified between residues 166 to 176 and
177 to 187 of the βglII and βglIIA precursors, respectively.
Also, the Met residue of this motif, which is invariant in
GH-16 laminarinases subfamily but not present in the
active site of the GH-16 lichenases subfamily members, is
likely to have an important structural role in the active site
of βglII, as observed in the Rhodothermus marinus LamR
laminarinase and bglA β-glucanase [39,39] and the
archeon Pyrococcus furiosus LamA laminarisase [34]).
Notably, the βglIIt form purified from strain DSM 10297
has been shown to be able to hydrolyse both β-1,3- and β1,3-1- 4-glucan (lichenan) [21], as reported for some
other members of the GH-16 laminarinases subfamily
[39,39]. As noted earlier [18], it is remarkable that GH-16
β-1,3-glucanases have 9 highly conserved tryptophan residues.
Sequence identity of the 54.5 kDa β-1,3-glucanase from C.
cellulans ATCC 21606 GH-64 catalytic domain with other
β-1,3-glucanases of this family of glycosyl hydrolases
ranges from 99% identity to the β-1,3-glucanase of Arthrobacter sp. YCWD3 (GenBank accession number D23668)
to 60% and 31% to the Laminaripentaose-Producing β1,3-glucanase of Streptomyces matensis DIC-108 [40] and
the β-1,3-glucanase B from Lysobacter enzymogenes [37],
respectively. In contrast to β-1,3-glucanases from strain
ATCC 21606 and Arthrobacter sp. YCWD3, the β-1,3-glucanases from S. matensis and L. enzymogenes do not contain the carbohydrate-binding modules at the C-terminus.
This indicates that the liberation of only laminaripentaose
as the degradation product from β-1,3-glucan observed
for this family of enzymes is not related to their CBM. The
54.5 kDa β-1,3-glucanase GH-64 catalytic domain from
strain ATCC 21606 shares a very low sequence identity to
βglII and βglIIA GH-16 catalytic domains (15% and 19%,
respectively, over the entire domain). Similarity and phylogenetic analyses have also been reported for GH-64
enzymes [37].
The sequence identity between each of the three imperfect
repeats found at the C-terminal region of βglII ranges
from 53.3% to 36.8%. A similar set of repeats are found in
the C-terminal CBM of the C. cellulans ATCC 21606 β-1,3glucanase, as well as in other yeast-lytic enzymes, namely
in the C-terminal mannose-binding domain of the Rarobacter faecitabidus Protease I (D10753) [40]. As mentioned, all these domains belong to the CBM family 13.
The members of this CBM family usually have approxi-

mately 150 residues, which always appear as a threefold
internal repeat. These modules were first identified in several plant lectins such as ricin or agglutinin of Ricinus communis, which bind galactose residues. Family 13 CBMs are
also found in bacterial proteins with rather diverse functions, e.g. xylanases, arabinofuranosidases, β-1,3-glucanases, and proteases (CAZy database, [31-33]). Moreover,
it also includes the central domain of the subunit α of the
horse-shoe crab (1→3)-β-D-glucan sensitive coagulation
factor precursor (GenBank accession number D16622),
[36]. Alignment of these sequences reveals the presence of
6 very well conserved cysteine residues, two per repeat
(Figure 2a). Besides, the C-terminal repeats from βglII and
the β-1,3-glucanase from the ATCC 21606 strain have significant similarities with the repeats found in several plant
lectins such as the galactose-binding specific rRNA N-glycosilases (ricins and agglutinins) from Ricinus comunis
(castor bean) (GenBank accession numbers M12089 and
X52908), [43,43]. Pair wise similarities of these protein
domains with the 120-aa C-terminal region of βglII range
between 73.3% and 36.3% of identity in 120 aa overlaps
(Figure 2a). Although knowledge about the structurefunction relationships of the family 13 CBM domains is
limited, important information can be derived from the
X-ray and site directed mutagenesis studies of the ricin βchain [44]. This lectin chain is composed of two major
domains, 1 and 2, each of which has a galactose-binding
site. Each of these domains contains three copies (α, β,
and γ) of a primitive 40-residue folding unit or subdomain. Subdomains α1 and γ2 contain the galactosebinding sites. A detailed local similarity analysis (Figure
2b) of the C-terminal region of the βglII precursor (317Asn
– 435Leu) reveals that the 40 aa-repeats (R1, R2, and R3)
from this enzyme show significant sequence identities
with repeats α and β of the ricin β-chain (e.g. 45% identities between R1 and α1). Similarities of R1, R2, and R3 to
γ subdomains are lower (e.g. 30% identities between R1
and γ2). Since cysteine positions in subdomains α and β
are conserved and known to form disulfide bonds,
cysteine residues in each of the βglII repeats may possibly
be involved in disulfide bond formation (i.e. 320Cys339Cys, 361Cys-378Cys, 405Cys-423Cys), and play an important role in the tertiary structure of this region of the protein. In addition, residues 22Asp, 35Gln, 37Trp, 46Asn, and
47Gln in the α subdomain from the ricin β-chain, which
1
are known to form the galactose-binding pocket, are also
conserved (except 46Asn) in each of the three repeats of
βglII (Figure 2b). Furthermore, the hydrophobic residues
21Val, 34Ile, 36Leu, 49Trp, and 57Ile in the α subdomain,
1
where they play an important structural role in the preservation of its tertiary structure, are also conserved in subdomains R1, R2, and R3. Overall, one can predict that
each repeat in the C-terminal region of βglII may constitute a subdomain with a similar fold to the α, β, and γ subdomains of the ricin β-chain.

Truncated yeast/fungi-lytic β-glucanases, chitinases and
proteases lacking their corresponding CBMs show
reduced activities against viable yeast/fungal cells while
retaining their capacity to depolymerise colloidal glucan
or chitin, or to degrade proteins [16,41,46,46]. As summarised above, the proteolytic removal of the CBM from
βglII dramatically reduces its capability to lyse viable yeast
cells. However, the ability of the βglIIt form to lyse viable
yeast cell walls is restored in the presence of the yeast-lytic
protease component secreted by C. cellulans [22]. This
synergistic effect between the βglIIt form and the lytic proteases suggests that the affinity of this β-1,3-glucanase for
the glucan layer of the cell wall does not depend on the
possession of the carbohydrate-binding domain, as it can
readily solubilise the glucan component of the yeast cell
wall when the outer mannoprotein layer is removed by
the proteases. However, there is no reported evidence on
whether the CBM may have any effect on the Km values of
βglII for insoluble substrates such as yeast glucan. Affinity
of the βglII catalytic domain to polysaccharides could be
partially conferred by some of the highly conserved tryptophan residues, as observed in some polysaccharidebinding proteins [47]. Interestingly, some of these residues are believed to be located at the surface of the GH-16
LamR laminarinase from R. marinus [38].
Considering that the ricin B-chain exhibits galactosebinding activity and has a specifically high affinity for the
oligosaccharides from cell wall surfaces (it binds much
more strongly to complex galactosides from cell wall surface carbohydrates than to simple sugars, [48]), its similarity to the βglII C-terminal repeats suggests that these
constitute a lectin-like domain with binding activity
towards oligosaccharides of the yeast cell wall surface,
which are rich in mannose. In addition, the similarity of
this domain with the R. faecitabidus yeast-lytic Protease I
mannose-binding domain and the strain ATCC 21606 β1,3-glucanase carbohydrate-binding domains, leads to the
conclusion that the C-terminal domain of these C. cellulans β-1,3-glucanases is a mannose-binding module, and
that it is also essential for efficient lytic activity towards
viable yeast cells. Mannose-binding domains may play an
important general function in targeting yeast/fungi-lytic
enzymes to their substrates by increasing their local concentration on the yeast/fungal cell wall surface, which is
rich in mannoproteins. Recent studies on the S. cerevisiae
cell wall architecture using Quantazyme ylg (i.e. the pure
recombinant β-1,3-glucanase preparation from C. cellulans ATCC 21606) have revealed that this enzyme is able
to release cell wall mannoproteins by cleaving β-1,3chains, to which these cell wall proteins are attached [4].
However, the mode of action of βglII and its precise target
on its natural substrate, the yeast cell wall, is still
unknown. It is significant that C. cellulans can co-produce
modular and non-modular β-1,3-glucanases, either by

Amino acid sequence alignments of family 13 carbohydrate binding modules
Amino acid sequence alignments of family 13 carbohydrate binding modules. Sequences were deduced from the
following GenBank accession numbers: C. cellulans DSM 10297 βglII glucanase (AF052745) [19] (indicated as C. cellulans 1); C.
cellulans ATCC 21606 β-1,3-glucanase (M60826) [16] (indicated as C. cellulans 2), Ricinus comunis agglutinin β-chain (M12089)
[42], Ricinus comunis ricin β-chain (X52908) [43], Streptomyces thermoviolaceus xylanase I (AB110643) [49], Streptomyces lividans
α-arabinofuranosidase and xylanase A (M64551) [51], and Rarobacter faecitabidus Protease I (D10753) [41]. Comparison of the
βglII CBM amino acid sequence with related CBMs. The amino acid residues conserved in all of the sequences (boldface), the
residues involved in galactose binding in the ricin β-chain subdomains α 1 and γ2, and the corresponding analogous positions in
all the subdomains of the aligned sequences (in red), conserved residues that form the hydrophobic core of each ricin β-chain
subdomain (in blue), and conserved Cys residues (black background) are marked. Sequence identity values (in %) are referred
to the C. cellulans βglII sequence. (A) Sequence similarity of the R1, R2, and R3 subdomains of the βglII CBM, and the subdomains α 1 and γ2 of the ricin β-chain.

proteolytic digestion of modular species, or by expressing
specific genes, suggesting that these truncated versions
have also an important role in cell wall degradation (figure 1). At this stage, it is apparent that more comprehensive studies are needed in order to evaluate the specific
role of modular and non-modular yeast/fungi lytic β-1,3glucanases on the yeast cell wall degradation, and their
interactions with other lytic enzymes secreted by these
bacteria.

ing domain located at their C-terminal that is lacking in
GluA and βglIIA. Interestingly, the substrate-binding Cterminal regions observed in some of these β-1,3-glucanases belong to different CBM families, namely family 13
for C. cellulans glucanases and, family 6 for L. enzymogenes
[37]. This diversity observed among enzyme type and
source organism is a trait indicative of domain shuffling
in the evolution of glycosyl hydrolases.

Conclusion
Besides C. cellulans, there are other prokaryotes, such as L.
enzymogenes and S. coelicolor, known to produce multiple
β-1,3-glucanase systems with the ability to lyse fungal/
yeast cells. These three species contain both GH-64 and
GH-16 enzymes. Furthermore, these β-1,3-glucanase systems share significant similarities in terms of structural
organisation. For instance, GluC and GluA from L. enzymogenes, and βglII and βglIIA from C. cellulans have GH-16
catalytic domains;gluC and βglII contain a substrate-bind-

Availability of recombinant C. cellulans β-1,3-glucanases
has opened the door to comprehensive characterisation
(and future engineering) of these biotechnologically
important enzymes, which is key for the development of
new/potential applications or the optimisation the existing ones. Nevertheless, a better understanding of the basis
of the substrate specificity and interactions with the yeast
cell wall components still awaits a detailed comparison of
the three-dimensional structures of these enzymes and
