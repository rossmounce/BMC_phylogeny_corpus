MapMi: automated mapping of microRNA loci
José Afonso Guerra-Assunção1,2, Anton J Enright1*

Abstract
Background: A large effort to discover microRNAs (miRNAs) has been under way. Currently miRBase is their
primary repository, providing annotations of primary sequences, precursors and probable genomic loci. In many
cases miRNAs are identical or very similar between related (or in some cases more distant) species. However,
miRBase focuses on those species for which miRNAs have been directly confirmed. Secondly, specific miRNAs or
their loci are sometimes not annotated even in well-covered species. We sought to address this problem by
developing a computational system for automated mapping of miRNAs within and across species. Given the
sequence of a known miRNA in one species it is relatively straightforward to determine likely loci of that miRNA in
other species. Our primary goal is not the discovery of novel miRNAs but the mapping of validated miRNAs in one
species to their most likely orthologues in other species.
Results: We present MapMi, a computational system for automated miRNA mapping across and within species.
This method has a sensitivity of 92.20% and a specificity of 97.73%. Using the latest release (v14) of miRBase, we
obtained 10,944 unannotated potential miRNAs when MapMi was applied to all 21 species in Ensembl Metazoa
release 2 and 46 species from Ensembl release 55.
Conclusions: The pipeline and an associated web-server for mapping miRNAs are freely available on http://www.
ebi.ac.uk/enright-srv/MapMi/. In addition precomputed miRNA mappings of miRBase miRNAs across a large number
of species are provided.

Background
Recently, miRNAs have been shown to be a large and
diverse class of regulators [1,2]. A large effort has been
under way to clone and sequence miRNAs using a variety of technologies in multiple species and tissues [3,4].
These molecules are 18-22 nt and function via binding
to the 3’UTRs of their target transcripts [5]. This binding event is targeted via complementarity between
miRNA and target sequence. The binding of a miRNA
to its target transcript causes repression of translation
and also transcriptional destabilisation [6]. miRNAs
have been implicated in a large and growing number of
diseases and processes across both animal and plant
kingdoms [7,8]. The miRBase database is the primary
repository for these data [9]. It focuses on both nomenclature and recording of precursor and mature
sequences and their probable genomic loci. Currently
many deposited miRNAs are derived from model organisms (e.g. Human, C. elegans). Given that many miRNAs
* Correspondence: aje@ebi.ac.uk

European Bioinformatics Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus,
Hinxton, Cambridge CB10 1SD, UK

are highly conserved between species [10] it is likely, for
example, that a miRNA discovered in C. elegans will
also be present in C. briggsae. In other cases even in
one species there may be multiple genomic loci which
could encode a detected mature miRNA sequence and
not all of these may be annotated in miRBase. This
implicit bias towards model organisms hampers miRNA
research in other organisms and makes evolutionary and
phylogenetic analysis of miRNA families across species
extremely difficult. Given a mature miRNA sequence in
one species it is possible to detect the likely location of
its orthologue in another species using both sequence
analysis and RNA secondary structure prediction. Our
assumption here is that an orthologous miRNA will possess both a high degree of similarity to the miRNA
mature sequence and that identified orthologous loci
should have the capability to form the stem-loop structure typical of miRNA precursors. Some groups use ad
hoc methods for miRNA mapping analysis, however
such approaches are generally either not available to the
community, have not been validated or are too specific
for general use. For example, miROrtho [11] provides

web-access but not methods or raw data, while CoGemiR [12] provides raw data but does not allow sequence
searches. Another tool, miRNAminer [13] requires the
user to provide both the mature sequence and the precursor sequence and runs on a limited set of species.
For these reasons, it is very difficult to directly compare
the existing methods to MapMi in terms of performance. However, where possible we have compared predictions from MapMi against CoGemiR, miRNAminer
and miROrtho (see Additional file 1). The most complete comparison is with miROrtho where there is a
high degree of overlap between the methods, for the
species where their data is freely available. When human
miRBase miRNAs are used as a reference set, both
methods predict a shared set of 478 loci, while miROrtho predicts 49 loci that MapMi does not and
MapMi detects 139 loci not detected by miROrtho (see
Additional file 1, Figure S4). Many methods have
focused on prediction of novel miRNAs from genomic
hairpins [14] which is a non-trivial problem. In our case

Page 2 of 7

we focus on the simpler task of mapping an identified
miRNA in one species to others using both sequence
similarity and RNA secondary structure. While our system has not been designed for predicting the loci of
novel miRNAs, it is useful to leverage on the data produced by other methods, expanding it to other species.
We describe our approach to miRNA mapping and
demonstrate that it performs well, discriminating
between true miRNAs and false-positives. The approach
is freely available as both software and a web interface.
Furthermore, we provide precomputed mappings of all
miRBase miRNA sequences across 46 Ensembl genomes
and 21 Ensembl Metazoa genomes [15]. We will maintain this resource through subsequent updates of miRBase for all species available in Ensembl.

Implementation
Pipeline

The MapMi pipeline works as follows (Figure 1). The
system is supplied with a set of input sequences

Figure 1 MapMi Webserver Work flow. Work flow of the MapMi web pipeline. The user can use the service by either providing a potential
mature sequence to map, or by querying the results database, either with a miRNA name or a job id if retrieving results from a previous run.

Guerra-Assunção and Enright BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11:133
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/133

corresponding to mature miRNA sequences. The user
then decides which species to map these sequences
against. The stand-alone version of MapMi allows the
user to supply their own genomic sequence. The genomes used have previously been processed using RepeatMasker [16] to remove repetitive elements, that are not
similar to known miRNAs [17] (see Additional file 1,
Table S3). The provided input sequences are scanned
against selected genomes using the Bowtie algorithm
[18], which is designed for efficient short sequence
matching. The system allows no gaps but up to three
mismatches, allowing one mismatch by default. Each
match is extended to produce a pair of potential
miRNA precursors through extension of 110 nt (e.g. 70
nt 5’ and 40 nt 3’ and vice versa). Each of these potential
precursors is then folded using ViennaRNA [19]. A scoring function is used to evaluate each candidate. The
scoring function (see below) takes into account both the
quality of the sequence match and the structure of any
predicted hairpin. The best candidate is selected based
on the score (either 5’ or 3’). Candidates are further filtered according to a score-threshold. This is defined by
the user, however a number of suggested thresholds are
provided. These thresholds have been selected according
to an empirical analysis of true and shuffled miRNA
sequences (see Additional file 1, Table S4). All miRNA
precursor loci above threshold are reported to the user
with their associated scores and other relevant information. As an alternative, the user can query a database of
pre-computed results, using a miRNA name as a query,
and selecting the desired species and threshold.
Finally, the web version of MapMi provides detailed
further analysis capabilities for precomputed results.
This includes the generation and display of Maximum
Likelihood phylogenetic trees (PhyML [20] & PhyloWidget [21]), Multiple sequence alignments (MUSCLE [22]
& Jalview [23]) and RNA Structural logos (RNALogo
[24]).
Scoring Function

MapMi takes into account several properties of known
miRNAs in its scoring function (Equation 1). In this
context, Mismatches, Matches and PerfectMatches correspond to the number of nucleotides that are part of
the predicted structure between the two arms of the
stem loop. Mismatches correspond to the number of
structurally unpaired bases, Matches to the number of
structurally paired bases and PerfectMatches to actual
basepairing. Mature Mismatches are obtained by parsing
the output of Bowtie, the HairpinDeltaG is the value of
minimum free energy returned by RNAfold, and MismatchPenalty is a parameter specified by the user. The
MismatchPenalty parameter is important to distinguish
sequences with mismatches from sequences with no

Page 3 of 7

mismatches, that can match to the same loci. The parameter can be set to a value that is large enough to
enable this distinction but at the same time does not
hamper the method’s functionality by penalising mismatches too much (i.e. excluding sequences that have
less than the maximum allowed number of mismatches,
because the penalty is too high). A warning is displayed
if this is likely to be the case.

Validation

The negative dataset was generated by using ushuffle
[25] to generate 10 and 100 shuffles per initial nucleotide sequence. Due to their nucleotide composition,
some of the 4,237 initial sequences could not be shuffled
the required number of times. The resulting in datasets
contained 42,366 and 423,343 random shuffled
sequences respectively. These datasets were mapped
against all 67 genomes under analysis.
Repeat Masking

The repeat masking procedure applied to the genomes
prior to the analysis is useful to avoid the detection of
repeat elements that contain sequences similar to
known miRNAs. Nevertheless, as a consequence of this
procedure some miRBase annotated miRNAs [17] are
masked and therefore reduce the sensitivity of our
method (see also Additional file 1, Tables S1 and S2).

Results and Discussion
We applied MapMi to 67 Ensembl and Ensembl Metazoa Genomes using all 7,844 metazoan miRBase miRNAs, of which 4,237 have a unique sequence (see
Methods). In total, we identify 16,025 loci in all genomes under analysis using the default threshold (35),
including 10,944 loci not previously reported in miRBase
(Table 1). The phylogenetic profiles of miRNAs in each
species are shown (Figures 2 & Additional file 1, Figure
S2). The phylogeny derived from clustering these profiles broadly agrees with known phylogenetic relationships (Figure 3). Genomes were masked for repetitive
elements before further analysis (see Implementation).
Validation

We evaluate the performance of the scoring function
(see Equation 1) by comparing score distributions from
a positive dataset containing 4,237 miRBase (Release 14)
deposited unique sequences from Metazoan species, to a

Summary of the number of loci per species that overlap miRBase annotated loci, and the number of times the overlapping loci is correctly named by MapMi.
This analysis could not be performed for all species, as miRBase loci coordinates were not readily available. We present results for two different parameter sets.
(1) MapMi default parameters with no repeat element post-filtering. (2) MapMi allowing only perfect matches, post-filtering for sequences that are associated
with repeat elements and map to multiple places in the genome (details of filtered sequences in Additional file 1, Table S3).

negative dataset composed of dinucleotide shuffled versions of the sequences in the positive control (see
Implementation). The score distributions from both
positive and negative control sequences are shown
(Additional file 1, Figure S1). This illustrates that real
miRNAs perform significantly better than shuffled miRNAs according to the scoring function described above.
This also allows us to derive reasonable thresholds for
large-scale mapping projects that balances sensitivity
and specificity (Additional file 1, Table S4).
To assess the performance of our pipeline when predicting miRNA orthologues in a more general context,
we analysed MapMi predictions of horse miRNAs.
Horse was chosen because it was recently introduced in
the latest release of miRBase. We used miRBase v13
deposited Metazoan miRNAs, that do not include horse
sequences, to predict horse miRNAs. The overlap of
MapMi predictions and miRBase v14 deposited horse
miRNAs was 82.99% (Additional file 1, Table S5). The
ability of our classifier function to distinguish miRNA
hairpins from other genomic hairpins was verified by

classifying the 8,494 non-miRNA hairpins as reported in
[26]. We obtained a correctly classified ratio of 93.14%.
Further verification was done for the genomes for
which miRBase genomic coordinates are available, to
assess how many MapMi predictions overlap with miRBase annotated miRNA loci and how many of those are
correctly named. We found that 85.05% of our predictions overlap with miRBase with 99.09% of those being
assigned the same name as miRBase (Table 1).
Nine miRNAs appear to be highly conserved across the
majority of species (Additional file 1, Table S6). These
miRNAs include the well-known let-7 family, previously
known to be highly conserved [10]. Conversely, a total of
636 miRNAs were shown to be species-specific mostly in
Chicken, C. elegans, Cow, Platypus, Human and Mouse.
This result may arise due to some organisms being more
heavily profiled (e.g. Human and Mouse). Additionally,
some species have few related species available for comparison (e.g. X. tropicalis) and would appear to have an
excess of species-specific miRNAs. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is not believed to possess machinery for miRNA

Figure 2 Heatmap of Drosophilid miRNAs. This figure was generated from a presence/absence matrix, it is color coded to illustrate the effect
of mapping using MapMi in the overall view of miRNAs in the species under analysis. Dark purple corresponds to an overlap between MapMi
predictions and miRBase annotation. Blue indicates miRNAs that are only present in MapMi, while green indicates miRNAs that are on miRBase
but are missing from the MapMi predictions. Bias towards model organisms is readily apparent in this view. It is also clear from the image that
MapMi is complementing miRBase in a way that is broadly coherent with the expected evolution of miRNAs across the metazoan lineage. The
different species are ordered respecting their phylogenetic relationships, as present in the NCBI taxonomy.

processing, however it is present in Ensembl and was
retained as a negative control. As expected, no miRNAs
were found in S. cerevisiae. These results indicate that
while miRBase has excellent coverage of many species, it
appears to be only capturing a fraction of the total number
of miRNAs in some species. Hence, we believe that these
results can complement miRBase.

Conclusions
We present a new system for miRNA mapping through
sequence similarity and secondary structure, which is
available both as a stand-alone tool and an online web
resource. We demonstrate the selectivity and sensitivity of
the approach on a variety of datasets and have applied it
to a large number of genomes. This is particularly useful
for recently sequenced genomes where miRNA information may be absent or sparse. Using this approach we have
mapped miRNA loci in 67 genomes, many of which are
not present in miRBase. We provide a web-interface and a
database of pre-computed miRNA loci, multiple sequence
alignments and phylogenetic trees for many genomes and
we hope this system will prove useful to the community.
