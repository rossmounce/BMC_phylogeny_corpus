Abstract
Background: Identifying syntenic regions, i.e., blocks of genes or other markers with evolutionary
conserved order, and quantifying evolutionary relatedness between genomes in terms of
chromosomal rearrangements is one of the central goals in comparative genomics. However, the
analysis of synteny and the resulting assessment of genome rearrangements are sensitive to the
choice of a number of arbitrary parameters that affect the detection of synteny blocks. In particular,
the choice of a set of markers and the effect of different aggregation strategies, which enable coarse
graining of synteny blocks and exclusion of micro-rearrangements, need to be assessed. Therefore,
existing tools and resources that facilitate identification, visualization and analysis of synteny need
to be further improved to provide a flexible platform for such analysis, especially in the context of
multiple genomes.
Results: We present a new tool, Cinteny, for fast identification and analysis of synteny with
different sets of markers and various levels of coarse graining of syntenic blocks. Using HannenhalliPevzner approach and its extensions, Cinteny also enables interactive determination of
evolutionary relationships between genomes in terms of the number of rearrangements (the
reversal distance). In particular, Cinteny provides: i) integration of synteny browsing with
assessment of evolutionary distances for multiple genomes; ii) flexibility to adjust the parameters
and re-compute the results on-the-fly; iii) ability to work with user provided data, such as
orthologous genes, sequence tags or other conserved markers. In addition, Cinteny provides many
annotated mammalian, invertebrate and fungal genomes that are pre-loaded and available for
analysis at http://cinteny.cchmc.org.
Conclusion: Cinteny allows one to automatically compare multiple genomes and perform
sensitivity analysis for synteny block detection and for the subsequent computation of reversal
distances. Cinteny can also be used to interactively browse syntenic blocks conserved in multiple
genomes, to facilitate genome annotation and validation of assemblies for newly sequenced
genomes, and to construct and assess phylogenomic trees.

Background
The increasing number of newly sequenced genomes is
stimulating interest in comparative genomics and highlighting the need for the development of efficient tools
that enable assessing their evolutionary relatedness. One
problem of central importance is the identification of
blocks of genes (or other markers) with evolutionary conserved order. These synteny blocks help in tracing back the
evolution of genomes in terms of rearrangement events,
such as reversals, translocation, fusion, fission etc. Consequently, genome evolution and phylogenetic (or phylogenomic) trees can be reconstructed from the analysis of
synteny [1-5]. Furthermore, the presence of conserved
blocks of genes in multiple genomes may also indicate
functional relatedness of their products, e.g., in terms of
protein-protein interactions [6] or presence of functionally important non-coding regions [7].
The evolutionary distance between two genomes can be
expressed in terms of the minimum number of reversals
to transform one genome into another, which is also
referred to as the reversal distance [1-5]. In this approximation, translocation, fission and fusion events are represented as reversals, whereas the effect of transpositions is
neglected. Furthermore, it is important to realize that RD
is dependent on the choice of a set of discrete markers that
are conserved between two (or more) genomes, the actual
definition of synteny blocks (that may allow for small
divergences in gene order, e.g. due to micro-rearrangements), the algorithm used to detect synteny blocks and
various other parameters. Therefore, synteny identification and the resulting reversal distances need to be carefully assessed with respect to these choices, requiring fast
algorithms and flexible tools.
A number of browsers, including Ensembl SyntenyView
[9,10] and NCBI's MapViewer [11] can be used to visualize synteny for well annotated genomes. While the existing tools offer a variety of graphical representations of
synteny blocks, they typically show pre-computed results
for selected genomes and do not allow users to interactively assess the effects of the choice of a set of markers or
other critical parameters, such as the minimum length of
synteny blocks or the required minimum number of
markers within a block. Furthermore, the evolutionary
distances between genomes of different species are not
computed directly by these tools. We developed a new
web server, called Cinteny, which combines fast computation and assessment of the reversal distance with interactive synteny browsing and visualization in multiple
genomes.
Thanks to remarkable algorithmic developments, the
reversal distance (RD) can be efficiently computed in linear time [2,8]. Utilizing these algorithmic achievements,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/82

the GRIMM server was developed [12] to compute
reversal distances for arbitrary pairs of genomes. However,
the genomes of interest, as defined in terms of specific
markers, must be first converted to signed numeric permutations by the user. This makes the use of GRIMM and
interpretation of its results somewhat tedious, especially
for multiple genomes. Cinteny addresses these limitations
and additionally provides a number of features that facilitate identification and visualization of synteny blocks
and measuring the reversal distance in multiple genomes.

Implementation
Data structure and algorithm
In order to efficiently represent the linear order of markers
on a genome, Cinteny uses a tailored data-structure,
which is implemented as a straightforward extension of
ternary search trees (TST) [13]. In particular, we extended
TSTs by "walks" through the leaves of the tree, which correspond to "walks" on the genome markers in their linear
order. Such markers can be defined, e.g., by using the
notion of orthologous genes, which are also referred to as
homologous genes to indicate the similarity or homology
between their sequences. Thus, homologous genes can be
identified in the genomes of interest using sequence alignment and other annotation methods. We would like to
comment, however, that the data structure and implementation considered here are, in fact, applicable to other
readily available sets of unique markers that can be identified in the genomes of interest, as discussed in the
Results and Discussion section.

Figure 1 shows an example of a TST used by the Cinteny
server, with several genes from the human, mouse and rat
genomes as well as the corresponding walks. The TST is
constructed with the gene symbols (nodes of the TST are
represented by round circles in the figure, e.g., S, E, etc.)
and the leaf nodes (shown as ovals, e.g., AK, CTH, etc.)
represent each homologous group (a unique string representing the name of a gene representing that group). The
individual genes belonging to each homologous group
are connected below the leaf node as meta nodes (shown
as rounded rectangles, Human AK, Mouse Ak, Human
CTH, etc.). Linear walks are formed by connecting meta
nodes based on the order in which the markers appear on
a chromosome, as shown by arrows connecting the meta
nodes, e.g., Mouse Srm → Mouse E2f2 → Mouse Wnt4. The
strandedness (orientation) of a gene is stored in the node
using an additional variable, and thus the whole genome
may be formally represented as a signed permutation. The
latter is required in order to apply the HannenhalliPevzner theorem and based on it efficient algorithmic
solutions [2].
There are several advantages of this hybrid data-structure:
i) a gene may be searched in logarithmic time as the com-

plexity of TST is similar to a binary search tree; ii) starting
with a gene, one can directly enumerate all orthologs; iii)
starting with a gene, one can visit the genes upstream and
downstream by traversing up or down the walk. These factors facilitate the identification of conserved blocks and
their representation in the form of a signed numeric permutation in linear time. Consequently, the reversal distance can be computed in linear time overall, using the
approach by Hannenhalli and Pevzner [2], with modifications proposed by Bader and colleagues [8]. Moreover, the
construction of the TST graph and associated walks scales
linearly in practice (with the theoretical complexity of
Nlog(N) where N is the number of markers), which
makes it is suitable for large genomes. As result, a typical
query, involving computation of the reversal distance for
a pair of mammalian genomes, takes only a few CPU second on a typical desktop PC.
Initially, we define the synteny blocks by identifying
blocks of conserved markers without any disruption of
order and all the genes or other markers having the same
relative orientation, i.e., two signed permutations representing these blocks being identical up to one reversal
operation. These initial blocks with perfectly conserved
order are subsequently extended (aggregated) into larger
(non-overlapping) synteny blocks by ignoring smaller
blocks, such as those resulting from micro-rearrangements. The aggregation strategy used here is based on that
of Peng and colleagues [14] and involves adjustable
parameters defined in the Results and discussion section
(e.g., minimum length of synteny blocks).
These parameters effectively define the extent to which
small divergences are tolerated within extended synteny
blocks. We note also that many divergences in gene
(marker) order may involve markers only observed in
some genomes; these are thus automatically filtered out
when multiple genomes are used, as described in the next
section. The resulting coarse-graining leads to further
computational simplifications, making Cinteny suitable
for large scale comparisons of multiple genomes and a
comprehensive sensitivity analysis of the results.
Using multiple genomes
Finding synteny blocks and the reversal distance typically
involves identifying markers (genes, sequence tags, etc.)
that are shared by two species of interest. For example, the
synteny between human and mouse can be analyzed
using 15,645 orthologs, as identified by HomoloGene
[11]. Using Cinteny, one may extend this approach to
include a reduced set of markers common to multiple species, e.g., 6,425 genes common to human, chimpanzee,
dog, mouse and rat genomes. In the latter case, the pair
wise synteny (and reversal distance) between human and
mouse may be found using this reduced set of 6,425 genes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/82

(markers). The advantage of this approach is that only
highly conserved segments are used and the aggregation
of synteny blocks is taken care of automatically, filtering
out micro-rearrangements. On the other hand, in some
cases this strategy may lead to a significant loss of data,
especially if one of the genomes included in the analysis
is poorly annotated, resulting in many missing genes or
other markers. We stress, however, that the multiple
genome-based approach is just one of several available
options for synteny block detection that can now be easily
compared with alternative strategies.
Visualization
Cinteny enables analyses of genome rearrangements at
three different levels: genome-wide, chromosome or
around individual genes. The graphical layer for synteny
browsing and analysis is built using PHP and enables
intuitive interpretation of the results. All graphical representations are cross-linked and can be browsed interactively. For example, one can easily jump from a genome
level view to a chromosome level view, or further magnify
a synteny block for a detailed study. The graphical elements are also linked to external resources, such as NCBI.
Public domain packages, including GBrowse [15] and
SynView [16] are also used to provide alternative views of
synteny blocks.

Results and Discussion
In this section, we demonstrate examples of interrogating
evolutionary relatedness of genomes using the Cinteny
server. Different types of queries and different setup of
parameters are illustrated. In particular, we show how the
Cinteny web server can be used to identify synteny blocks
and compute the reversal distance (RD) between whole
genomes as well as between any two chromosomes of two
genomes.
In order to perform sensitivity analysis for the computation of RD and identification of synteny blocks, Cinteny
allows the user to interactively adjust several parameters,
including: i) minimum length of synteny blocks (denoted
as min_len); ii) maximum gap between adjacent blocks
for aggregation (denoted as max_gap); iii) minimum
number of markers in a block (denoted as min_num).
Aggregation refers here to combining smaller synteny
blocks to form larger blocks, wherever feasible. For example, by increasing the length between adjacent blocks
(max_gap), one may effectively join segments which are
otherwise far apart and obtain longer synteny blocks.
Thus, such aggregation provides an effective coarse-graining of synteny blocks and affects the resulting RDs.
Another problem in applying algorithms for synteny
block identification is posed by degenerate markers, such
as paralogs (i.e., multiple copies of the same gene). In par-

BMC Bioinformatics 2007, 8:82

ticular, the Hannenhalli-Pevzner theorem assumes that
markers are unique [2]. In order to address this problem,
Cinteny offers several different options for dealing with
paralogs and enabling the assessment of these heuristics.
One rational strategy is to use a paralog which lies within
the most conserved region (i.e., the largest synteny block).
In fact, this is the default option used also for all the examples shown in this paper. Other options, which are provided to enable an assessment of the results of such
arbitrary choices, include the use of a random paralog or
ignoring all genes which have paralogs.
Whole genome analysis
Finding synteny and the RD between whole genomes is
discussed here as an example of a typical application in
comparative genomics. Figure 2 shows the synteny blocks
for human and mouse genomes. The genome shown in
the right panel (mouse in this case) is the source genome
and the genome on the left (human) is the target genome.
All chromosomes of the source genome are shown in
unique colors. Each chromosome of the target genome is
shown as composed of segments of some chromosome of
the source genome, as indicated by the corresponding
color. For example, the majority of human chromosome
1 is composed of (i.e. is syntenic to) mouse chromosomes
4, 3 and 1.

The figure was generated using a particular level of coarsegraining (aggregation), as defined by min_len = 300 Kb,
max_gap = 1 Mb and min_num = 3. The number of synteny blocks found with these parameters and using the set
of 15,645 human-mouse orthologs, as identified by
HomoloGene 46.1 [11], is 359 and the RD is 261. These
results are in qualitative agreement with previous studies
[17]. However, it should be noted that by changing the
level of coarse graining one may obtain very different
results. For example, using min_len = 0, max_gap = 0 and
min_num = 2 (this experiment is equivalent to no aggregation of synteny blocks) we find that number of synteny
blocks increases to 828 and the RD to 348, respectively.
We discuss further the problem of the dependence of the
results on the parameters in Multiple Genomes section.
Chromosome level analysis
Cinteny can also be used to identify synteny blocks and
reversal distance between two chromosomes. In this case
we use common markers located on the chromosomes of
interest. In Figure 3, we show an example of synteny for
the X chromosome of the mouse and the rat genomes. Figure 3A shows the syntenic blocks obtained without any
aggregation (except for imposing that min_num = 2). The
number of synteny blocks is 85 and the RD is 52 in this
case. On the other hand, when using the aggregation
described in the previous section, the number of synteny
blocks is reduced to 17 and the RD to 8, respectively (see

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/82

Figure 3B). As discussed later, similar results were
obtained by imposing natural coarse-graining that utilizes
multiple genomes.
Analysis of individual synteny blocks
In addition to queries illustrated above, one may use Cinteny for visualization and analysis of the synteny around
a specific marker or gene. For example, starting with
human and mouse genomes and default aggregation
parameters, we find that the human BRCA1 gene is
present in a conserved region of size 7.2 Mb in human
chromosome 17, whereas its mouse ortholog (Brca1) is
present in a conserved region of size 6.1 Mb on mouse
chromosome 11 (see Figure 4). On the other hand, the
DKK1 gene is present in a conserved region of size 2 Mb
in the human genome and its ortholog, Dkk1, is present
in a conserved region of size 1.7 Mb in the mouse
genome. Several examples of such queries are available in
the online help available at the Cinteny web site.
Using multiple genomes
The use of multiple genomes for genome rearrangement
analysis has been proposed before, e.g., in order to derive
relationships between canine and other mammalian
genomes [18]. Cinteny web server allows one to perform
a 2-way (two genome-based) as well as multi-way (multiple genome-based) analysis. As an example, Figure 5 compares the whole genome synteny between rat and mouse
genomes, as identified using 2-way and 5-way strategies
that utilize subset of markers common to two (rat and
mouse) or five genomes (human, mouse, dog, chimpanzee and rat), respectively (see also the Implementation
section).

An intermediate aggregation level is used here for the twoway comparison (Figure 5A), with min_len = 100 kb and
max_gap = 100 kb, leading to a reversal distance of 128.
In Figure 5B, the same setup of parameters is used, except
that only orthologs common to the five mammalian
genomes are used. In the latter case, the RD of 86 is
obtained. In addition, one can see that there are, in general, fewer gaps (represented by white spaces) in the 5-way
analysis (Figure 5B), as a result of a natural coarse-graining due to selecting only highly conserved markers
included in 5-way analysis.
Thus, as illustrated above, the absolute values of reversal
distances may vary significantly with different choices of
markers and aggregation strategies. We would like to comment, however, that RD is much more sensitive to the
choice of parameters (min_len in particular) when using
the 2-way approach, which can be easily verified using the
Cinteny server. It also interesting to note that in relative
terms (e.g., when using the mouse to rat distance normalized by the human to mouse distance) the reversal dis-

tances appear to be quite constant for a range of
aggregation parameters, especially when using the multiple genome approach (data not shown). This may suggest
that RDs can be used to indicate evolutionary relatedness
in relative terms, as long as proper parametrization of the
problem is used. This is the subject of a future work.

included in the on-line help. We also comment that recent
efforts to better and more fully annotate orthologous
genes in hundreds of sequenced genomes [19] will likely
make tools for multiple genome-based analyses even
more important.

To further illustrate the usefulness of multi-way approach,
we performed a 5-way analysis for the X chromosome of
mouse and rat without any aggregation, yielding the RD
of 14 and 19 synteny blocks. Comparison with Figure 3B,
as well as comparison of the number of synteny blocks
and RDs obtained using different aggregation strategies,
suggests that using multiple genome approach provides a
natural coarse-graining that allows one to select appropriate aggregation parameters for genomes of interest. Additional examples, e.g., regarding fungal genomes that are
characterized by very different gene densities and high levels of genome rearrangements (making the choice of suit-

Conclusion
The identification of synteny blocks, and the subsequent
calculation of the reversal distance, is highly sensitive to
the choice of parameters. Therefore, sensitivity analyses
and careful assessments of the choice of critical parameters are important for drawing meaningful conclusions
from inter-genomic comparisons. We present a new tool
which offers a flexible platform for such analysis, enabling
customization of synteny block detection and sensitivity
analysis for the resulting estimates of evolutionary relatedness and plausible scenarios of genome rearrangements
from ancestral genomes.

Cinteny performs all computations on the fly, allowing
the parameters to be adjusted and the results recomputed
interactively. Since the computation of the reversal distance for a pair of mammalian genomes takes only about
a few seconds, one can easily assess the effects of various
approximations and different levels of coarse-graining.
For example, blocks larger than 300 kb are typically used
for analysis of mammalian genomes. However, a different
threshold may be more appropriate for smaller genomes,
e.g., fungal genomes. In particular, a natural aggregation

of synteny blocks can be achieved using multiple
genomes. In addition, the effect of paralogs may be
assessed by choosing a range of options, from removing
all paralogs to using the ones that are contained within
the largest conserved blocks.
While some well-annotated genomes like human, mouse,
rat, dog, chimpanzee, nematode, drosophila, fungal
genomes, etc. are pre-loaded, Cinteny also allows users to
upload their own data. Hence, it can readily be used for
