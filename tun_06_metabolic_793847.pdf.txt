Abstract
Background: In this work a simple method for the computation of relative similarities between
homologous metabolic network modules is presented. The method is similar to classical sequence
alignment and allows for the generation of phenotypic trees amenable to be compared with
correspondent sequence based trees. The procedure can be applied to both single metabolic
modules and whole metabolic network data without the need of any specific assumption.
Results: We demonstrate both the ability of the proposed method to build reliable biological
classification of a set of microrganisms and the strong correlation between the metabolic network
wiringand involved enzymes sequence space.
Conclusion: The method represents a valuable tool for the investigation of genotype/phenotype
correlationsallowing for a direct comparison of different species as for their metabolic machinery.
In addition the detection of enzymes whose sequence space is maximally correlated with the
metabolicnetwork space gives an indication of the most crucial (on an evolutionary viewpoint)
steps of the metabolic process.

Background
The concept of network in the sense of a set of mutually
interacting elements whose collectivebehaviour gives rise
to emergent properties is a very fruitful metaphor [17].
Thus we can readabout gene networks [23], protein interaction networks [3], metabolic networks [7], ecological
networks [12] or even protein folding networks [20].
A lot of both theoretical and experimental works
[21,4,24,14], were devoted to network analysis in trying
to identify network invariants important for predicting
collective behaviour. We concentrate on the between

organisms variability in metabolic networks wiring patterns: we developed a simple method to estimate the similarities among different organisms metabolic networks in
a way formally identical to biopolymer sequence comparisons. The topic is not new, many groups developed quantitative methods to compare the topological similarities of
metabolic networks [6,10,25], the originality of our proposal relies on the simplicity and amplitude of application range of the method together with the definition of a
general strategyfor comparing the network and sequence
metrics. We will show how the relation between network
and sequence similarity spaces is a potentially fruitful new

avenue for evolution studies, providing a system level
phenotypic character (network wiring) amenable to quantitative phylogenetic analysis and easily comparable to
phylogenetic structures generated by molecular level
approaches like biopolymer sequences. The correlation
between network and sequence spaces can give useful
hints about the relative importance of the involved
enzymes for the entire pathway functioning.

Results and discussion
The first analysed case was relative to glycolisis/gluconeogenesis module, the general scheme of the metabolic network is reported in Fig. 2, the bolded enzymes are the one
common to all the analysed microrganisms. The data
come from the KEGG data base [26]. The inter-organisms
network dissimilarity matrix was first computed on 25
microrganisms, the clustering tree relative to this dissimilarity matrix is depicted in Fig. 3a, where a clear separation
of the different species is evident. To test the stability of
the obtained result, an addition of other 18 microrganisms (9 archaea and 9 bacteria (Mycobacteria and Clamidophylae)) to a total of 43 units was made, the general
tree is reported in Fig. 3b. A simple inspection of Fig. 3b
allows for the immediate recognition of a two cluster
organization separating archaea species from the others as
well as the two newly inserted bacterial species, while the
initial 25 organisms classification was kept unchanged.
Having obtained such a proof of the stability of network
based classifications, we went back to the original 25 species set so to isolate the principal metabolic factors giving
rise to the observed classification structure and looking for
possible relations between metabolic and sequence
spaces.
To this aim the dissimilarity matrix was considered as a
unit/variable matrix and submitted toprincipal component analysis (PCA) [1]. This procedure gave rise to a low
dimensional space explaining the major portion of the
original information: a two component plane explained

the 85% of total information, thus we can project the statistical units into a bidimensional plane saving almost the
entire information originally present in the dissimilarity
matrix. The firstcomponent explains around the 73% of
total variability, this means that ordering the considered
networks along the first component saves a major part of
their diversity (Table 1). This isin line with the presence of
a general two cluster solution in Fig. 3a tree separating
Bacillus-E. Coli and Buchneria-Mycoplasma-Streptococcus groups that in turn corresponds to the most extreme
loadings on the first component (Table 1).
The minor components account for relatively secondary
features of the dissimilarity structure of the data set, with
the second component mainly linked to the Streptococcus
species specificity and the third component describing the
Bacillus genus singular behaviour.
We projected the 25 species on the first two components
axes, weighting each component for its percentage of
explained variability, so to obtain a realistic quantitative
picture of the Glycolisis/Gluconeogenesis space spanned
by the analysed microrganisms, this space is reported in
Fig. 4.
By superimposing the different metabolic networks, we
observed that the main difference between the networks
posited at the two opposite first component ends, is the
presence (absence) of the lateral branching of the Glycolisis/Gluconeogenesis module deputed to the utilization
of Arbutin and Salicin as substrates for Glycolisis (ellipse
of Fig. 2). This difference in the use of substrates for energy
production is the main physiological determinant of the
metabolic network wiring differences in our data set. The
25 analysed organisms share 11 common enzymes of the
Glycolisis/Gluconeogenesis pathway (bolded in Fig. 2)
thus, each of these enzymes allows for a specific sequence
space to be constructed and compared with the metabolic
network space. It is well known that the correlation of two
protein distance spaces is a marker of some form of interaction between the two molecules [8], and this feature is
routinely adopted for inferring protein-protein interactions [13]. The need to support a viable interaction
between two proteins imposes a mutual constraint
(resulting into a covariation) to the random mutation
drift of the two systems. This covariation results into correlated dissimilarity matrices (trees) relative to the two
proteins as for a suitable set of organisms [8].
This is exactly what we observed for the 11 common Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis sequence based dissimilarity
matrices: from each of these 11 matrices we extracted the
first principal component, these components were in turn
subjected to a 'second order' PCA generating a first common component (pc1(common)) being made of all pos-

itive loadings and explaining the 76% of total sequence
variability (Table 2). This is a consequence of the strong
physiological interaction between the enzymes participating in the same metabolic module constraining their specific mutational drifts. It is worth noting we are using the
first component of the dissimilarity matrices instead of
the matrices themselves so to rule out effects due to the
obvious species specificity of each single enzyme and to
concentrate on the major flux of variation (between clusters relations). From Table 2 we note that only two
enzymes, namely 4.2.1.11 (phosphopyruvate hydratase)
and 5.4.2.1 (phosphoglyceromutase) show a significant
loading on components different from the first common
axis of variation; this implies the presence of a significant
specific general order parameter (respectively the second
and third component) driving the evolution of these two
systems independent of the common flux of variation
(first component) acting on the entire enzyme set.
The first component, correspondent to the common flux
of variation shaping the sequence space of the Glycolisis/
Gluconeogenesis enzymes, was discovered to be significantly correlated with the first principal component of the
metabolic space (pc1w vs. pc1(common): Pearson r = 0.52, p < 0.01) thus highlighting a 'general resemblance'

between phenotypic (metabolic network) and genotypic
(protein sequence) spaces. But if we go in deep and measure the correlation of each of the single major component
axes of the different enzymes with the first metabolism
component (pc1w) we note a striking correlation between
the 4.2.1.11 (phosphopyruvate hydratase) specific first
component and the metabolic component. This correlation corresponds to an almost total linear superposition
between the phosphopyruvate hydratase sequence space
major component and first general metabolic component
correspondent to a Pearson r = -0.94 (p < 0.001), this
implies an almost perfect coincidence of the two spaces as
depicted in Fig. 5. The negative sign of the relation is simply due to the arbitrary character of the principal components direction. Phosphopyruvate hydratase is the
enzyme at the interface between the Glycolisis and Gluconeogenesis modules, moreover it represents the link of the
module with other biochemical processes like Photosynthesis, Aminoacid Biosynthesis and Cytrate Cycle, this
'frontier' position is registered by the loading of its dissimilarity space on components other than the common variation axis. These considerations allow us to hypothesize
this enzyme represents a crucial point of the module, integrating the module functioning with the global metabolism of the organism. This probably 'exposes' the enzyme

with the relation of the essential character of enzymes and
their peripherical position in metabolic networks recently
discovered by our group in yeast metabolome [18].

evolutionary bases.

Conclusion

It is worth noting that when we tried and correlate the
metabolic dissimilarity matrices with the different
number of genes codifying, in each species, for the different involved enzymes, we did not find any significant correlation. This is in line with the finding of Papp and
colleagues [19] indicating multiplicity of isozymes to be
essentially linked more to flux regulation than to basic
wiring topology. Due to absence of reliable kinetic data,
we adopted a purely topological view of the metabolic
network, nevertheless the method could in principle be
applied to kinetic data by substituting the Hamming metrics (see Methods) based on the absence/presence of a
given reaction with the Euclidean metrics based on the
values of a kinetic costant (or any other convenient weight
coefficient attached to the different arcs).

Metabolic networks wiring can be considered as a 'complex' phenotype, crucially related to both organism evolution history and ecological niche. The strong correlation

than the one attained by nucleic acid comparisons) and

The procedure we adopted for the analysis of Glycolysis/
Gluconeogenesis pathway can be applied to any other
metabolic module [see Additional file 1] as well as to the
entire metabolic network so to obtain a 'metabolome distance' relative to the whole metabolism of an organism.
The phylogenetic tree relative to the whole metabolic network for the 25 and 43 organisms data set are reported in
figures 6a and 6b respectively and the concordance with
the Glycolisis/Gluconeogenesis based classifications is
evident.

There are in literature some other network comparisons
methods: one is PathBlast that has been used on protein
interaction network with success [22]. However, PathBlast
does not deal with network divergence in sufficient detail
and is not explicitly based on metabolic networks. Moreover it is definitively more complex in terms of computation. The seminal work on network quantitative
comparison is, to our knowledge, the Dandekar and colleagues one [6]. The method proposed by the authors is

its elementary modes. This is not a pre-requisite of our
method that, on the contrary can be immediately applied
on the adjacency matrix without further complications.
This allows for the analysis of the whole set of metabolic
reactions without being limited to specific modules. The
Zhu and Qin [25] approach is not based on pathway
alignment: the authors derive some general numerical
descriptors of the network wiring topology (number of
edges, clustering coefficient and so forth) allowing to
associate to each network a numerical vector having as
components the above mentioned descriptors. The
between networks comparisons are thus based on the
comparisons of the relative profiles in terms of the
descriptors: this is particularly convenient for mechanistic

studies but does not allow for an accurate phylogenetic
analysis. The Hong et al. [10] approach is the most similar
to ours among all the currently adopted methods of pathway alignment: it allows for the comparison of very large
networks, but again it is based on the segmentation of a
pathway into the constituent sub-pathways, while this
intermediate step is not required by our methodology.
The most important feature of our method is the possibility to put on quantitative basis, thanks to the filtering
action of principal component analysis, the relation
between the shape of metabolic networks and the
involved enzymes sequence space, thus finding the 'crucial' elements of the network. A last methodological

remark is linked to the robustness of the attained classifications when in presence of 'noise' due to errors in wiring
pattern: we demonstrated (data not shown) that the classification tree relative to the entire metabolome remains
stable until 5% of 'errors' in the form of elimination/addition of arcs to the original network.
A lot of applications can be imagined for comparative network studies, going from the correlation between metabolic network shapes and the pattern of sensitivity to
specific antibiotics to large scale environmental studies of
ecological communities so to correlate metabolic similarities to food-web structures.

Methods
A metabolic network can be represented as a binary square
adjacency matrix having as rows and columns the intervening metabolites and taking 1/0 values depending on
the presence/absence of an arc between the corresponding
elements. In the case of metabolic networks, an arc corresponds to the presence of one (or more) enzyme catalysing a chemical reaction transforming a metabolite into
another. The irreversibility of some reactions make the
adjacency matrix not symmetrical, Figure 1 reports the
adopted formalization stressing the relation holding
between the di-graph and matrix notations.
The adjacency matrix formalization was very useful in
describing a lot of network structures, particularly rich is
the literature adopting this notation for organic molecules, in this case an arc represents a chemical bond
between two atoms and the matrix is isomorphic to the
structural formula of the molecule [15,2].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/24

Thus we obtain a 'percentage of dissimilarity' ranging
from 0 (complete equivalence of the two networks) to
100.
This operation, when applied to a set of n different networks will end into a symmetric nXn dissimilarity matrix
conveying all the information linked to the pairwise similarities between the correspondent organisms in terms of
the metabolic module analysed.
Being the dissimilarity matrix fully quantitative, it can be
analysed by means of the whole range of multidimensional statistical techniques (multidimensional scaling,
principal component analysis...) as well as to be the basis
for the construction of similarity trees.
In this work we analysed different sets of microrganisms
as for different metabolic networks, moreover we computed the correlation between distance matrices based on
metabolic network superposition with the corresponding
distance matrices relative to the aminoacid sequences of
some enzymes acting in the network. The Jukes-Cantor
score on the maximum likelihood estimate of the number
of substitutions between two sequences was adopted for
protein data. All the metabolic networks were downloaded from KEGG database [11] using Cellware platform
[5]. A total of 25 organisms were randomly selected from
five prokaryotic genera based on the availability of metabolic data (Figure 3a). The total data space consisted of
31,945 metabolites (average 1277.8/organism, range
350â1943), and 1901 pathways (average 76.04/organism, range 32â111).

Authors' contributions
The adjacency matrix allows for a straightforward metrics
to compare different metabolic networks to be developed.
The considered networks are relative to the same pathway
(or module, like glycolisis, purine metabolism, aminoacid biosynthesis...) in different organisms thus giving
rise to a specific adjacency matrix for each organism. All
these matrices have the same set of rows and columns correspondent to the maximal coverage of the whole set of
intervening metabolites (it is sufficient a given metabolite
is present in a single network to be included). The distance
between each pair of networks will be simply set to the
Hamming distance between the two networks, i.e. to the
number of discrepancies (1 vs. 0 or 0 vs. 1) scored in the
corresponding elements of the two networks. The Hamming distance corresponds to the classical Nei distance
proposed for evolutionary studies [16].
In order to make the metrics independent of the number
of analysed variables (metabolites) we divide the sum of
the discrepancies by the total number of variables (maximal attainable distance) and multiply the ratio by 100.

The original idea of the approach was introduced by AG
from a methodological point of view. KTimplemented
and analyzed the network datasets. PKD applied the idea
to the metabolic networks/sequence data comparisons.
MCP designed the statistical analysis (Principal Component Analysis) All authors contributed to the writing, read
and approved the final manuscript.
