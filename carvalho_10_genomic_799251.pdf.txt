Genomic and evolutionary comparisons of
diazotrophic and pathogenic bacteria of the
order Rhizobiales

Abstract
Background: Species belonging to the Rhizobiales are intriguing and extensively researched for including both
bacteria with the ability to fix nitrogen when in symbiosis with leguminous plants and pathogenic bacteria to
animals and plants. Similarities between the strategies adopted by pathogenic and symbiotic Rhizobiales have
been described, as well as high variability related to events of horizontal gene transfer. Although it is well known
that chromosomal rearrangements, mutations and horizontal gene transfer influence the dynamics of bacterial
genomes, in Rhizobiales, the scenario that determine pathogenic or symbiotic lifestyle are not clear and there are
very few studies of comparative genomic between these classes of prokaryotic microorganisms trying to delineate
the evolutionary characterization of symbiosis and pathogenesis.
Results: Non-symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria and bacteria involved in bioremediation closer to symbionts and
pathogens in study may assist in the origin and ancestry genes and the gene flow occurring in Rhizobiales. The
genomic comparisons of 19 species of Rhizobiales, including nitrogen-fixing, bioremediators and pathogens
resulted in 33 common clusters to biological nitrogen fixation and pathogenesis, 15 clusters exclusive to all
nitrogen-fixing bacteria and bacteria involved in bioremediation, 13 clusters found in only some nitrogen-fixing
and bioremediation bacteria, 01 cluster exclusive to some symbionts, and 01 cluster found only in some pathogens
analyzed. In BBH performed to all strains studied, 77 common genes were obtained, 17 of which were related to
biological nitrogen fixation and pathogenesis. Phylogenetic reconstructions for Fix, Nif, Nod, Vir, and Trb showed
possible horizontal gene transfer events, grouping species of different phenotypes.
Conclusions: The presence of symbiotic and virulence genes in both pathogens and symbionts does not seem to
be the only determinant factor for lifestyle evolution in these microorganisms, although they may act in common
stages of host infection. The phylogenetic analysis for many distinct operons involved in these processes
emphasizes the relevance of horizontal gene transfer events in the symbiotic and pathogenic similarity.

Background
The order Rhizobiales of alpha-Proteobacteria includes a
variety of bacteria strategically important for their diversity in function and in niche occupancy. Studies of this
order are thus interesting because it includes bacteria
capable of fixing nitrogen when in symbiosis with leguminous plants, as well as obligate and facultative intracellular bacteria and animal and plant pathogens.
Interestingly, these species with contrasting functionality

share both some degree of genomic conservation and
similarity among the symbiosis and pathogenicity strategies [1-4]; furthermore, these microorganisms take
advantage of a variety of strategies to adapt and exploit
ecological niches [5]. Altogether, genomic comparisons
among symbiotic and pathogenic bacteria of the order
Rhizobiales may provide significant insights about
genetic variability, genome functionality, and operon
organization of related species.
The nitrogen fixation ability in a free-living state is
considered an ancient process; however, the evolution of
the symbiosis with legumes was only possible due to the
functional integration of the nodulation and nitrogen

fixation genes over time. The ability to fix nitrogen has
a more promiscuous nature, as observed in phylogenetic
reconstructions of structural genes, such as the 16S
rRNA, and nif and fix genes, while nodulation has a
very specialized character which evolved in function of
the host plant [6,7]. Finally, although nitrogen fixation
and nodulation genes originated in divergent times, it is
believed that through the mechanisms of gene transfer
the genes related to both processes were grouped in
operons and probably co-evolved in symbiotic bacteria
[8]. Despite being widely distributed in the Archae and
especially in the Bacteria domains, the process of biological nitrogen fixation is not monophyletic, with its origin and distribution being modified in function of
selective pressures and processes as gene duplication,
loss, and gene transfer [9-12].
Important not only as a factor contributing to the
flexibility and adaptability of the genomes, the horizontal gene transfer is also involved in the generation of
new symbiotic strains and might be the main factor
responsible for the phylogenetic proximity between rhizobia and pathogenic bacteria, as well as for the similarities and/or divergences between the symbiosis and
pathogenesis processes [13-19]. Transference may thus
be the main factor explaining the presence of virulence
genes in diazotrophic symbionts (e.g., homologous
virB1-virB11 in Rhizobium (= Agrobacterium)tumefaciens and Mesorhizobium loti R7A) [20,21] as well as
nitrogen-fixing genes in pathogenic bacteria (e.g. homologous to the cluster fixNOQPGHIS in the pathogens
Brucella melitensis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) [22].
In addition, it has also been demonstrated that the plant
pathogen R. tumefaciens is capable of nodulating
legumes after receiving a symbiotic plasmid [23]. However, until now, the functional evidence of the natural
coexistence of genes for symbiosis and pathogenicity has
been demonstrated only in strains of R. rhizogenes [24].
Despite the intriguing evolutionary questions raised in
the analysis of symbiotic and pathogenic bacteria of the
order Rhizobiales, very few studies of comparative genomics with a significant number of distinct genera and
representative species of both lifestyles have been conducted between species of this prokaryotic order. In this
study we have done such comparisons aiming at
increasing the existent knowledge about the evolutionary
divergence of these biological processes.

Results
Phylogenetic reconstructions were performed in order to
analyze the dynamics of the symbiosis and/or pathogenesis processes along the evolution of the species in
study.
The phylogenetic reconstruction model obtained
with the 104 concatenated housekeeping proteins of 25

species and 30 strains with complete genome available
presented a branched topology of two groups - one
composed mostly of photosynthetic, methylotrophic,
and bioremediation bacteria; and the second composed
mostly of symbiotic and pathogenic bacteria. The second group is further subdivided into two major subgroups, one with the symbionts (except for R.
tumefaciens, a pathogen showing high similarity with
the symbionts), and another gathering the pathogens
(Figure 1). Non-symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria and
bacteria involved in bioremediation closer to symbionts
and pathogens in study may assist in the origin and
ancestry genes and the gene flow occurring in Rhizobiales, and were considered in the comparisons.
From the 25 species used in the phylogenetic reconstruction, 19 were selected for comparative analysis
(Additional file 1); in addition to Rhizobium sp. strain
NGR 234. Four main Bidirectional Best Hits (BBH)
were performed with the following genomic comparisons: i) symbiotic and non-symbiotic nitrogen-fixing
bacteria; ii) nitrogen-fixing and bacteria involved in
bioremediation; iii) pathogenic bacteria; and iv) considering all 19 species analyzed. In addition, two BBHs
with lower stringency were performed, one for nitrogen-fixing bacteria and bacteria involved in bioremediation and another for pathogens, in order to identify
clusters not obtained in the BBHs previously mentioned. To determine the common set of genes related
to biological nitrogen fixation, a BBH was performed
including genomic and plasmid sequences of symbiotic
nitrogen-fixing bacteria and the non-symbiotic Xanthobacter autotrophicus Py2, and resulted in 51 clusters
(Figure 2A). Considering the processes defined in the
literature by using the model bacterium for symbiosis,
Bradyrhizobium japonicum USDA 110 [25,26], of the
51 clusters identified, 23 are specific of biological
nitrogen fixation, pathogenesis, and conjugation processes (Table A2a of supplementary material in database), in addition to 02 clusters related to protein
secretion and integration and recombination processes
(not analyzed) (Figure 2A).
Given the phylogenetic proximity observed in the reconstruction model between bacteria involved in bioremediation (Rodopseudomonas palustris BisA53),
degradation of hydrocarbons (Mesorhizobium BNC1 and
X. autotrophicus Py2) and oxidation of manganese (Aurantimonas SI85 9A1) with the symbiotic bacteria considered in this study, a BBH was performed to identify
common genes to the processes of nitrogen fixation and
bioremediation, and interestingly, the same clusters
identified in the BBH of nitrogen-fixing bacteria were
obtained in the BBH of nitrogen fixation and bioremediation (Table A2a of supplementary material in
database).

Figure 1 Phylogeny model reconstructed with 104 housekeeping concatenated proteins of representatives of the Rhizobiales order.
Phylogeny model reconstructed with 104 housekeeping concatenated proteins of 30 strains (belonging to 25 species) of the order Rhizobiales.
The Neighbor-Joining method was applied with Phylip 3.67 program and 1,000 replicates for bootstrap support. Representatives of the betaProteobacteria class were used as the outgroup. The 19 strains selected for the comparative analyses in this study are highlighted (Rhizobium sp.
NGR234 is not included in this tree because its complete genome is not available).

In the BBH performed to identify common genes
exclusive of pathogenic bacteria, 851 clusters were
obtained (Figure 2B). From these, 24 clusters involved
in pathogenicity, protein secretion, and integrationrecombination processes were selected, based on the
best studied plant pathogen, Rhizobium tumefaciens
C58 [27-29] in addition to clusters involved in biological nitrogen fixation. R. tumefaciens was considered as
the reference organism for pathogenesis because the

symbionts in this study interact with plants and
because in the animal pathogens of the Rhizobiales
order, virulence-associated type IV secretion proteins
homologous to R. tumefaciens were identified [30-32].
Of the 24 clusters obtained, 11 of these clusters were
analyzed in this study. The remaining 13 are related to
protein secretion and integration-recombination (Figure 2B) (Table A2b of supplementary material in
database).

In the BBH performed with lower stringency for nitrogen-fixing bacteria and bacteria involved in bioremediation, 41 extra clusters of interest were selected (Figure
2A, and Table A2a of supplementary material in database); however, they did not include all bacteria used in
the comparison. Among these clusters, two clusters
were related to FixQ protein and two to NifS. Both
FixQ and NifS clusters were composed by a separate
group of bacteria. However, for each of these proteins,
the clusters obtained were grouped in the analysis. Of
the 41 clusters, 39 were analyzed. For pathogenic bacteria, of the clusters obtained in the analysis with lower
stringency, 25 were obtained and 24 were selected for
analysis (Figure 2B, and additional file 2) (in addition
Table A2 of supplementary material in database).
In the BBHs performed in this study, except for clusters related to protein secretion and integration-recombination, 96 clusters were selected. Of these, 81 are
common or exclusive to nitrogen-fixing bacteria, bacteria involved in bioremediation, and pathogenic bacteria BBHs. Of these, 63 were of interest for analysis
(except the clusters related to other evolutive mechanisms and those repeats for the same protein, which were
considered as one) (Figure 2). Among these 63 clusters,
33 were common to the process of biological nitrogen
fixation and pathogenesis (10 of nitrogen fixation, 02 of
nodulation, 09 of virulence, and 12 of conjugation), 15
clusters (NifABDEHKN, FixABCKX and NodBDM)
were exclusive to all nitrogen-fixing bacteria and bacteria involved in bioremediation, 13 clusters
(NodACJSZ, NifQXWZ, FixLU, TrbJ and FdxN) were
found in only some nitrogen-fixing and bioremediation
bacteria, 01 cluster (NolO) was exclusive to some symbionts, and 01 cluster (VirH) was found only in some
pathogens (Figure 2C). The clusters common and
unique to the groups mentioned above are presented in
additional file 3. In the BBH performed to all strains
studied, 77 common genes were obtained, of which 17
(FixA, FixB, FixI, FixG, FixH, FixK, FixN, FixO, FixP,
NifA, NifS, NodD, NodM, “VirB234”, VirG, TraG and
TrbB) are related to biological nitrogen fixation and
pathogenesis processes (Figure 2C).
Phylogenetic reconstructions were then performed to
the proteins identified in the BBHs with more representativeness among the genomes analyzed. The topologies
of Fix, Nif, Nod, Vir and Trb proteins (Figures 3 to 5,
and additional file 4), have shown some incongruences
when compared with the phylogeny model (Figure 1).
The reconstruction obtained for FixNOP (Figure 3A)
has a similar topology to the model with one exception.
In the model reconstruction, Mesorhizobium BNC1 is
close to the symbiont and pathogens branch, being
grouped with M. loti, while in the FixNOP tree, Mesorhizobium BNC1 is distant from M. loti, in a highly

Page 5 of 15

reliable branch, suggesting that these genes in Mesorhizobium BNC1 could have originated from horizontal
transfer.
The phylogenetic tree obtained with FixABC (Figure 3B)
was the most distinct from the phylogeny model. In the
group of photosynthetic, methylotrophic and bioremediation bacteria, Azorhizobium caulinodans is close to
Bradyrhizobium and distant from X. autotrophicus. In
the pathogen and symbiont group, Rhizobium etli is
grouped with M. loti and not with Rhizobium leguminosarum, which in turn is grouped with Ensifer (= Sinorhizobium)meliloti, while in the phylogeny model this
bacterium is more related to M. loti. Interestingly, the
same patterns of FixABC were obtained in NifAB, with
the grouping of R. etli - M. loti and R. leguminosarum E. meliloti (additional file 4). Furthermore, the grouping
between R. etli and M. loti and the proximity between
R. leguminosarum and E. meliloti were also maintained
in the reconstruction of NifDEKN, NifH, and NodABC
(data not shown). In the reconstruction using FixH, R.
tumefaciens appears to be more related to E. meliloti
than with Rhizobium vitis, though with a low bootstrap
support (additional file 4).
The FixS reconstruction (Figure 3C) is divergent from
the model tree in respect to Mesorhizobium BNC1 and
to the pathogens Brucella suis and Ochrobactrum
anthropi. Mesorhizobium BNC1 was positioned in a
separate branch and distant from M. loti, as also
occurred in the reconstruction of FixNOP; in addition,
B. suis and O. anthropi were closer to the nitrogen-fixing symbionts and methylotrophic bacteria. Although
the grouping of B. suis and O. anthropi has high statistical support, inferences about the proximity of these
pathogens with A. caulinodans and X. autotrophicus
cannot be done because the internal nodes of the tree
do not possess significant reliability values. A similar
pattern to FixS was obtained with the TrbCFGIJ conjugation proteins (Figure 3D). Mesorhizobium BNC1 and
the pathogen O. anthropi are closer to the symbiotic
bacterium A. caulinodans and the methylotrophic bacterium X. autotrophicus, with high bootstrap support. In
some of these species, transposases, integrases, and/or
hypothetical proteins were identified next to TrbCFGIJ.
In relation to the nodulation genes, as to the model
reconstruction (Figure 1), in the tree built with NodN,
M. loti is close to the O. anthropi, B. suis, and Bartonella quintana pathogenic bacteria branch, with high
reliability (Figure 4A).
The reconstruction with NodD (codified by nodD
orthologous, preceded by nodABC genes) presented the
most divergent topology among all trees obtained (Figure 4B). All groups are highly distinct from those
observed in the model phylogeny, and then it was not
possible to evidence the two main groups - one

composed of photosynthetic, methylotrophic, and bioremediation bacteria, and another composed of symbiotic
and pathogenic bacteria. Besides the discrepancy
observed for the Nif and NodABC proteins between R.
etli - M. loti and R. leguminosarum - E. meliloti, representatives of the genus Rhizobium (Agrobacterium) were
more related to the genus Bradyrhizobium than among
themselves. NodD and NodN were the only nodulation

proteins found in the pathogen R. vitis and in the symbiont Bradyrhizobium ORS278, although this symbiont
can nodulate without the involvement of nod genes [33].
In the NodD reconstruction, those species were grouped
with high reliability.

1) was not evident in the VirB8, VirB9 (Figures 5A and

topologies with these proteins, three patterns were
maintained: i) E. meliloti was grouped with R. tumefaciens and O. anthropi; ii) X. autotrophicus had higher
phylogenetic proximity with Rhizobium radiobacter; iii)
and Bradyrhizobium BTAi1 was more related to B.

Discussion
Despite the ecological and economical importance of the
process of biological nitrogen fixation, and the intriguing
evolutionary question about similarities and divergences
in the symbiotic and pathogenic processes, there are
very few studies of comparative genomics between these
classes of prokaryotic microorganisms. The databank
developed in this study offers an excellent opportunity
for such studies, allowing the comparison of 30 strains

of the order Rhizobiales with complete genomes available; in addition, the partial genome of the promiscuous
strain NGR 234 of Rhizobium sp. was also included. The
selected strains comprehend a good cover of the order
Rhizobiales, including 26 species of 12 genera, classified
in the main processes of biological nitrogen fixation,
bioremediation, and pathogenesis. Certainly, the databank created in this study http://www.bnf.lncc.br/comparative will be useful for several future investigations,
and in this study we have started by the comparison of
the organisms using the approach of the Bidirectional
Best Hits (BBH) method, selecting the proteins with
higher similarity in sets of strains according to their
function. From that, we built phylogenetic trees with
different groups of concatenated proteins, to try to infer
evolutionary pathways occurring in symbiotic and
pathogenic Rhizobiales, focusing on genes known
involved in these processes.
When compared with the phylogenetic model based
on 104 housekeeping genes, divergence was observed in
the Fix, Nif, Nod, Vir, and Trb topologies, and might be
attributed to the high frequency of horizontal gene
transfer (Figure 6), which has been reported in several
of the representatives of the order Rhizobiales [34-39].
The genomic location and the synteny are important
factors to be considered for horizontal gene transfer
analysis in the genes analyzed. Many of the fix, nif, nod,
vir and trb genes are located on plasmids or on chromosome in mobile elements called genomic islands. The
disagreement observed in the reconstructions performed
is corroborated by the absence of conservation of gene
order to Fix, Nod, Vir, and Trb proteins (Figures 7 to 9).
Interesting data were observed especially in the comparison of symbiotic and pathogenetic bacteria. In the
reconstruction using Fix proteins, the pathogenic and
symbiotic species are more related to each other, except
for FixABC. In this topology, the high reliability values
associated with branches hint at least two possible
moments of independent horizontal transfer events. In
one moment, a horizontal transfer event would have
occurred in X. autotrophicus and approximated this
nitrogen-fixing methylotrophic bacteria to the nonphotosynthetic symbiont group; and in another moment,
two other independent events would have occurred
between the nitrogen-fixing symbionts R. etli - M. loti
and R. leguminosarum - E. meliloti.
In the topology built with the TrbCFGIJ proteins, a
closer proximity between bioremediation bacteria,
pathogenic, symbiotic, and non-symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria was observed. TrbCFGIJ compose the trb
operon, whose proteins form a membrane-associated
macromolecular complex involved in mating-pair formation, facilitating the DNA transfer from donor to recipient cells [40]. The database built in this study shows

Page 8 of 15

that in the genomes of the bioremediatiors Mesorhizobium BNC1 and R. palustris, of the symbionts A. caulinodans and B. japonicum and of the methylotrophic
nitrogen-fixing bacteria X. autotrophicus, there are
transposases, integrases, and/or hypothetical proteins
next to the TrbCFGIJ proteins, contrarily to the pathogenic O. anthropi. This observation suggests that these
proteins may have been acquired through DNA transposition and/or integration mechanisms associated with
horizontal gene transfer events, which occurred in the
common ancestor of these species, and that other events
of gene transfer may have occurred in O. anthropi, leading to its divergence from the other pathogens analyzed.
In NodN, as well as in FixH, FixNOP, VirB8, VirB9,
and VirB10 topologies, the phylogenetic relationship
observed between M. loti and the Brucella-Bartonella
pathogens is corroborated by Paulsen et al. (2002) [3],
which showed that B. suis presents high similarity to R.
tumefaciens, E. meliloti, and M. loti, sharing extensive
syntenic regions with the latter. Since NodN was the
only nodulation protein present in all pathogens analyzed, in R. radiobacter, in photosynthetic nitrogen-fixing symbionts and other symbionts and in
Aurantimonas, it is possible that this protein: i) has
been acquired in an event preceding the separation
between photosynthetic symbionts and pathogens, being
lost in A. caulinodans, X. autotrophicus, and Mesorhizobium BNC1; or ii) that these organisms acquired this
protein after the divergence between photosynthetic
symbionts and pathogens, in a more recent horizontal
transfer event. There is very little information about
NodN. In R. leguminosarum, nodN is induced in
response to flavonone molecules and this induction is
nodD-dependent [41], and in both R. leguminosarum
and E. meliloti it has been demonstrated that NodN is
related to the root hair deformation phenotype, resulting
from the action of Nod factors [42]. Therefore, although
there are no experimental data on its biochemical function, in E. meliloti and R. leguminosarum it has been
hypothesized that this protein may be involved in the
synthesis and/or excretion of Nod factors [42]. In the
pathogens analyzed in this study, NodN could have an
auxiliary function during infection, modulating the
induction of cell proliferation, since Bradyrhizobium,
Ensifer, Rhizobium, Brucella, and Bartonella have similar
strategies of infection, although the mechanisms are different [43].
The NodD reconstruction showed highly divergent;
therefore, it was not possible to evidence the separation
between photosynthetic, methylotrophic, and bioremediation bacteria from the group including symbiotic and
pathogenic bacteria. The divergence observed might be
related to NodD function in host-bacteria symbiosis.
The host-bacteria specificity is established due to

transfer events occurring to Fix, Nod, Vir, and Trb proteins in the Rhizobiales species studied.

NodD-dependent upregulation of nod genes in response
to flavonoids in the host plant’s root exudates. NodD
directly interacts with flavonoids to activate nod gene
transcription, altering the response of the host cell
according to the flavonoids secreted [44,45].
Although NodD is involved in activation of other
nodulation genes, this protein belongs to the LysR-type
transcriptional regulator family, which regulates a variety
of genes, including those involved in virulence, quorum
sensing, and motility [46]. Besides this, some species
have more than one copy of the nodD gene. However,
the phylogenetic analysis was performed using the peptide sequence codified by the nodD that precedes the
operon nodABC. Since NodD can recognize different
inducers, and the processes of infection and nodule formation require other determinants than these specific
proteins, including other important proteins for the bacterium-host recognition [47], we may suppose that, in R.
vitis, the nodD ortholog gene might be involved in the
regulation of genes related to infection.

VirB8, VirB9, and VirB10 are transmembrane proteins
that compose the type IV secretion system (T4SS), a
structure consisting of several subunits that mediates
the translocation of macromolecules by the cell envelope
of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, used by
many pathogens for the secretion of virulence determinants in the process of colonization of host tissues [48].
A type IV secretion system equivalent to that of plant
pathogens has been described in the animal pathogens
Bartonella and Brucella. In species of these genera, it
has been demonstrated that VirB proteins are required
in stages of the infection as colonization and inhibition
of apoptosis and are essential for the virulence of some
pathogens [49-51].
In the symbionts E. meliloti and M. loti, T4SS is not
involved in the invasion and persistence of these microorganisms in their hosts [52]. In E. meliloti 1021, this
system is required for conjugation but not for symbiosis,
whereas the analysis of M. loti R7A and MAFF303099
has shown that T4SS is involved in the symbiosis

stabilization, increasing or decreasing the nodulation
phenotype, according to the host involved [53].
The homologous proteins of virB, AvhB8, AvhB9,
and AvhB10 genes identified in R. tumefaciens and
VirB8, VirB9, and VirB10 of E. meliloti are located on
plasmids. Although there is a considerable synteny
between R. tumefaciens and E. meliloti chromosomes
[5,26], conservation in the gene order among the plasmids of these microorganisms is not expected, due to
the high frequency of horizontal gene transfer between
plasmids of species of the Rhizobiales order. However,
the grouping observed between the symbiont E. meliloti and the pathogen R. tumefaciens in the reconstruction trees generated with VirB8, VirB9, and VirB10 is
in agreement with the topologies of VirB/Trb presented by Frank et al. (2005) [54], which examined the
functional divergence and horizontal transfer of the
T4SS. According to these authors, the coexistence of
the AvhB conjugation protein with VirB translocation

effectors in the same clade, as well as the location of
these proteins in plasmids and the presence of multiple
copies in some species, is indicative of the occurrence
of multiple events of horizontal gene transfer, the process believed to be responsible for spreading the virB
operon between the alpha-Proteobacteria, representing
the dominant mechanism in the evolution of the conjugation systems for secretion. Regarding the proximity
of the X. autotrophicus with R. radiobacter, and of
Bradyrhizobium BTAi1 with B. quintana or R. vitis,
there is no data in the literature that could allow inferences about such relationships. In these organisms, the
virB operon is located between hypothetical and Tra
conjugation proteins (data not shown). However, proteins involved in integration, transposition, and/or
DNA recombination were not identified close to
VirB8, VirB9, and VirB10 (database), which might
allow inferences that these genes could have arisen
from horizontal gene transfer.

Conclusions
In this study, the genomic comparison has shown that
symbiotic and pathogenic bacteria belonging to the
order Rhizobiales may share several similar strategies of
host interaction, inference taken from the high similarity
on several proteins identified - e.g., FixNOPQ, NodN
and VirB8910. However, it should be noted that some
common clusters obtained are formed by protein
families which may possess different functions in each
process. The presence of symbiotic and virulence genes
in both pathogens and symbionts does not seem to be
the only determinant factor for lifestyle evolution in
these microorganisms, although they may act in common stages of host infection. The phylogenetic analysis
has also emphasized the relevance of horizontal gene
transfer events to the evolution of the symbiotic and
pathogenesis processes, contributing to genomic plasticity and evolution. There are no studies of comparative
genomics in Rhizobiales with a focus on symbiosis and
pathogenesis processes with the analyzed representative

species of both lifestyles and showing phylogenetic analysis with many distinct operons involved in these processes. Besides this, the database offered by this study is
the most representative for Rhizobiales until now and
will also allow further important investigations that may
help to infer crucial events that had contributed to the
evolution of symbiosis of pathogenesis interactions.

Methods
In order to select the species used for genomic comparison based on their phylogenetic proximity, a reconstruction with 30 bacteria belonging to the order Rhizobiales
was obtained. The chosen strains belong to 25 different
species and 12 genera and are shown in Figure 1. The
reconstruction was performed by using a dataset consisting of 104 concatenated housekeeping proteins [55]
based on the work of Williams et al. (2007) [56] and
kindly provided by the authors, which showed a robust
reconstruction for alpha-Proteobacteria. In addition to
the species used by these authors, we included the

sequences of R. vitis strain S4 and R. radiobacter strain
K84, both previously classified in the genus Agrobacterium and both of whose genomes are available: strain S 4
is the pathogenic agent of crown gall disease in grapes,
while strain K84 is non-pathogenic and has been developed for worldwide commercial use to control crown
gall.
The tree generated was then established as the model
phylogeny. From this tree, species with the largest phylogenetic proximity with the neighbor species of the
other genera were selected, and representatives of the
beta-Proteobacteria class were used as the outgroup.
Therefore, from the 30 species used in the reconstruction model (Figure 1), 19 were selected for comparative
analysis (additional file 1). Rhizobium sp. NGR234 is not

present in the reconstruction tree because some of the
housekeeping proteins were not available, impairing the
alignment. However, this bacterium was included in the
comparison because it contains most of the genes analyzed in this study. R. palustris BisA53 was selected in
preference to Nitrobacter Nb-31 1A because it is phylogenetically closely related to B. japonicum. Mesorhizobium BNC1 (an EDTA-degrading bacterium formerly
known as Agrobacterium sp. BNC1), Aurantimonas
SI85-9A1 (a marine bacterium known by its role in Mn
(II) oxidation, and unusual in its feature of possessing
both the large and small subunits of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase - RubisCO) and X. autotrophicus Py2 (a nitrogen-fixing methylotrophic, found
in organic-rich soil, sediment, and water, and possessing

Carvalho et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:37

genes responsible for alkene degradation) were selected
by their proximity to the symbiotic bacteria in the phylogeny model (Figure 1), although they are not
symbionts.
The genomic and/or plasmid sequences of the 19 bacterial species used in this study (Table A1) were
acquired in the FTP format of the GenBank [57] and
were used to obtain groups of ortholog genes (clusters)
in genomes through the “Bidirectional Best Hits (BBH)”
method [58]. This method compares the genome of
each species against each other genome using the
BLASTP (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) program
[59] to identify corresponding gene pairs recognized as
the best hits in other genomes. BBHs among all functional groups (symbiotic, pathogenic and bioremediation-related), as well as between the species involved in
each process, were performed using as parameters a
coverage of 60% of the genome, 30% of identity, and evalue of 10-5.
For storage and analysis of data, a databank was developed in MySQL and Perl language [55]. The bank integrates tools and information from numerous biological
databases as Interpro (The Integrated Resource of Protein Domains and Functional Sites) [60], Psort (Protein
Subcellular Localization Prediction Tool) [61], KEGG
(Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) [62], COG
(Clusters of Orthologous Groups of Proteins) [63],
TCDB (Transporter Classification Database) [64], BlastP
of KEGG and UniProt/Swiss-Prot [65], allowing several
analyses as functional domains, subcellular localization,
identification of metabolic pathways, genomic context,
and alignment of proteins, among others. In addition,
the databank allows automatic genomic comparisons by
BBH between 31 species selected for study (the 30 bacteria shown in Figure 1 plus Rhizobium sp. NGR234)
and the searches may be performed by gene name or
synonym, sequence, and gene product. As the BBH
method restricts the data to all selected species and as a
gene may not be present in some species, comparisons
with low stringency can be made applying an arbitrary
minimum value of species compared within the interest
set, making it possible to obtain more information. The
databank is available at http://www.bnf.lncc.br/
comparative.
For phylogenetic reconstructions, this study used the
Neighbor-Joining method [66] of the Phylip (PHYLogeny Inference Package) [67] version 3.67 program [68],
with resampling of 1000 replicates. Concatenated reconstructions were generated for proteins corresponding to
genes organized in operons and identified in the same
sample set. Unrooted reconstructions were generated for
Fix, Nif, Nod, Vir, and Trb proteins, since it was not
possible to use the same outgroup strains.
