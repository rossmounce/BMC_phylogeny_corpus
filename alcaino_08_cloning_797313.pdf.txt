Abstract
Background: The yeast Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous synthesizes astaxanthin, a carotenoid with
high commercial interest. The proposed biosynthetic route in this organism is isopentenylpyrophosphate (IPP) → geranyleranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) → phytoene → lycopene → βcarotene → astaxanthin. Recently, it has been published that the conversion of β-carotene into
astaxanthin requires only one enzyme, astaxanthin synthase or CrtS, encoded by crtS gene. This
enzyme belongs to the cytochrome P450 protein family.
Results: In this work, a crtR gene was isolated from X. dendrorhous yeast, which encodes a
cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) that provides CrtS with the necessary electrons for substrate
oxygenation. We determined the structural organization of the crtR gene and its location in the
yeast electrophoretic karyotype. Two transformants, CBSTr and T13, were obtained by deleting
the crtR gene and inserting a hygromycin B resistance cassette. The carotenoid composition of the
transformants was altered in relation to the wild type strain. CBSTr forms yellow colonies because
it is unable to produce astaxanthin, hence accumulating β-carotene. T13 forms pale colonies
because its astaxanthin content is reduced and its β-carotene content is increased.
Conclusion: In addition to the crtS gene, X. dendrorhous requires a novel gene, crtR, for the
conversion of β-carotene to astaxanthin.

Background
Carotenoids are natural pigments of yellow, orange or red
color. More than 600 different chemical structures have
been described to date [1]. They are terpenoids with the

isopentenyl- pyrophosphate (IPP) molecule as the basic
unit. Astaxanthin is a carotenoid with a high commercial
interest due to its use as a food additive for trout and
salmon flesh pigmentation in aquaculture [2]. Its biosynPage 1 of 13

thesis is limited to a few microorganisms such as the
microalgae Haematococcus pluvialis and the basidiomycete
yeast Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous [3,4].
The first step in the biosynthesis of astaxanthin in X. dendrorhous is the isomerization of IPP into dimethylallyl
pyrophosphate (DMAPP) by IPP isomerase, which is
encoded by the idi gene [5]. Three IPP molecules are
sequentially added to one DMAPP molecule, where the
GGPP synthase (crtE gene) is involved, forming geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) [6]. Then, the condensation of two GGPP molecules produces phytoene, which
corresponds to the first carotenoid synthesized in the
pathway. This step is catalyzed by a bi-functional enzyme
called phytoene-β-carotene synthase (PBS), which also
has lycopene cyclase activity and is encoded by the crtYB
gene [7]. Subsequently, phytoene goes through four successive desaturation reactions, catalyzed by the phytoene
desaturase enzyme (crtI gene), producing lycopene [8].
Then, both lycopene ends are cyclized by the lycopene
cyclase activity of the bi-functional PBS enzyme, forming
β-carotene.
In the last step for the formation of astaxanthin from βcarotene, two enzymatic activities are required, ketolase,
to incorporate a keto group in positions 4 and 4' of β-carotene, and hydroxylase, to introduce a hydroxyl group at
positions 3 and 3' of β-carotene [9,10]. Unlike other
organisms, where two independent genes are needed for
this step, in X. dendrorhous a single crtS gene has been isolated that encodes an astaxanthin synthase which can
probably perform both activities [11-13]. However, it has
been suggested that CrtS may require an auxiliary enzyme
for the formation of astaxanthin from β-carotene [14].
The deduced CrtS amino acid sequence strongly suggests
that the X. dendrorhous enzyme belongs to the cytochrome
P450 protein family [12,14].
Cytochrome P450 enzymes require an electron donor for
the addition of oxygen-bearing functional groups to a
substrate. In eukaryotes, this electron donor is cyto-

chrome P450 reductase (CPR), encoded by the cpr gene
[15]. Although several genes for different cytochrome
P450 enzymes can exist in an organism, in most species
only one cpr gene exists. Some exceptions have been
observed in plants and zygomycetes that contain two or
three cpr genes [16].
In another study, an Escherichia coli strain was transformed with three compatible plasmids. The first plasmid
contained the necessary genes for the synthesis of β-carotene, the second contained the X. dendrorhous crtS gene,
and the third contained the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cpr
gene [12]. Through this system, it was possible to obtain
oxygenated β-carotene derivatives, but not astaxanthin,
suggesting the need for an appropriate CPR to complement the astaxanthin biosynthetic pathway. Prior to this
study, a X. dendrorhous gene encoding for a CPR for astaxanthin biosynthesis had not been isolated. This paper
describes for the first time the sequence of the X. dendrorhous crtR gene and its encoded polypeptide. Moreover,
our results reveal that the crtR gene product is essential for
astaxanthin biosynthesis in X. dendrorhous.

Methods
Strains, plasmids, media and enzymes
The strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in
Tables 1 and 2. The wild type X. dendrorhous UCD 67–385
strain was used for genomic and cDNA library construction. E. coli DH-5α strain was used as a host for plasmid
propagation and genomic libraries. Two genomic libraries
were used in this study. The first library consisted of
genomic DNA partially digested with BamHI and cloned
into the BamHI site of the YIp5 vector [6]. The second
library consisted of approximately 5 to 6 kb genomic DNA
fragments digested with SalI and cloned into the SalI site
of the pBluescript SK- vector. The cDNA library was constructed with the pBluescript II XR cDNA library construction kit from Stratagene [6].

crtR gene deletion bearing plasmids (pBsiWIΔcrtR::hph
and pNdeIΔcrtR::hph) were built from pCPR1.3 (Table 2),

which has the X. dendrorhous crtR gene. The deletions were
created by digesting pCPR1.3 with BsiWI or NdeI and then
filling the ends with Klenow polymerase to enable the
ligation of the blunt ended hygromycin B resistance cassette (hph) [6] for the selection of X. dendrorhous transformants.
X. dendrorhous strains were grown at 22°C with constant
agitation in YM medium (1% glucose, 0.3% yeast extract,
0.3% malt extract and 0.5% peptone) or MMV + 2% glucose medium [17]. UCD 67–385 strain fermentation was
performed in a 12 l jar fermentor (New Brunswick) containing 8.8 l of MMV + 2% glucose medium, shaking at
300 rpm and 13 l/min sterile air injection. Antifoam agent
(1520 US, Dow Corning) was automatically added when
required. E. coli strains were grown with constant agitation
at 37°C in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium and supplemented
with 100 μg/ml ampicillin for plasmid selection and 40 μl
of a 2% solution of X-gal (5-bromo-4chloro-3-indolyl-βD-galactopyranoside) for recombinant clone selection
[18]. For E. coli complementation experiments, the LB
growth medium was supplemented with 10 μM hemine
and 0.5 mM δ-aminolevulinic acid, which supports heme
prosthetic group formation in E. coli [12,19]. The expression was induced with 1 mM IPTG. Enzymes were purchased from Promega (TaqDNA pol, restriction enzymes,
Klenow polimerase, M-MLV reverse transcriptase).
DNA amplification
Primers were purchased from Alpha DNA (Montreal, Canada) and are listed in Table 3. PCR reactions were performed in a final volume of 25 μl containing 2 U of
TaqDNA pol, 2.5 μl of 10× Taq buffer, 0.5 μl of 10 mM
dNTPs, 1 μl of 50 mM MgCl2, 1 μl of 25 μM of each primer
and 10–20 ng DNA. Amplification was done in a DNA

denaturation at 95°C for 3 min; 35 cycles of denaturation
at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at 55°C for 30 s, synthesis at
72°C for 3 min and a final extension step at 72°C for 10
min. Samples were kept at 4°C until checked. The amplicons were separated by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis
in TAE buffer containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide
[18] followed by DNA purification using glassmilk [20]
for sequencing.
DNA sequence and bioinformatic tools
Nucleotide sequences were obtained from an ABI 3100
Avant genetic analyzer, using a DYEnamic ET terminator
Kit (Amersham Bioscience). DNA sequences were analyzed with Vector NTI Suite 10 (Informax), CLUSTAL W
1.8 and BLAST programs. Protein analysis was performed
with the online programs InterProScan http://
www.ebi.ac.uk/InterProScan/ and TMPRED http://
www.ch.embnet.org/software/TMPRED_form.html. Phylogenetic analysis was carried out using BioEdit 7.0.0 and
Treecon 1.3b.
Pulse field gel electrophoresis
Chromosomal DNA was separated by contour-clamped
homogeneous electric fields (CHEF) in a CHEF II BioRad
system in 0.9% agarose gels in TBE 0.5× buffer (45 mM
Tris-borate, 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0) at 14°C [21]. The pulses
used were 90 s for 24 h, followed by 120 s for 24 h at 6 V/
cm.
Southern blot hybridization
Southern blot hybridization was performed according to
Sambrook and Russell [18]. crtR probe was obtained by
PCR amplification with primers CPR3 and CPR7 of the
crtR gene. hph probe was acquired from PCR amplification

of the hph cassette using primers HF and HR. Probes were
labeled with [32P]α-dCTP using the Promega prime-agene labeling system.

1.5% agar plates supplemented with 10 μg/ml hygromycin B. The transformants were identified as X. dendrorhous
by ITS1, 5.8 rRNA gene and ITS2 DNA sequences [28].

RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis
Total RNA extraction was performed according to a modified protocol of Chomczynski and Sacchi [22,23]. The
determination of the relative levels of crtS and crtR
mRNAs was performed using a semi-quantitative RT-PCR
method. The intensities of the crtS and crtR amplification
bands were normalized with the intensity of the actin [24]
amplification product [23,25]. The amplicons were quantified with ImageJ 1.40 using a 100 bp DNA ladder (Fermentas) as the standard.

Pigment extraction and RP-HPLC
Carotenoid extraction was carried out from cellular pellets
according to the acetone extraction method [29]. Carotenoids were quantified by absorbance at 465 nm using an
absorption coefficient of A1% = 2,100. The analyses were
performed in triplicate, and pigments were normalized
relative to the dry weight of the yeast. Carotenoids were
separated by RP-HPLC using a reverse phase RP-18 Lichrocart 125-4 (Merck) column with acetonitrile: methanol:
isopropyl (85:10:5 v/v) as the mobile phase with a 1 ml/
min flux under isocratic conditions. The elusion spectra
were recuperated using a diode array detector.

X. dendrorhous transformation
X. dendrorhous transformation was performed by electroporation according to [26] and [27]. Electrocompetent
cells were prepared from an exponential culture with
DO600 nm = 1.2 grown in YM medium [6] and electroporated using a BioRad gene pulser × cell with PC and CE
modules under the following conditions: 125 mF, 600 Ω,
0.45 kV. Transformant selection was performed in YM

Results and discussion
Cloning of crtR gene
Three cytochrome P450 reductase genes were used for
primer design: from the zygomycete Cunninghamella
echinulata [GenBank:AF195660], the ascomycete Saccharomyces cerevisiae [GenBank:D13788] and the basidiomyc-

ete Rhodotorula minuta [GenBank:AB055119]. Based on
the conserved DNA segments, degenerate primers were
designed (Table 3). PCR reactions were performed using
genomic DNA from UCD 67–385 X. dendrorhous as a template and different combinations of forward and reverse
primers. An amplicon of 1.6 kb was obtained when PCR
reactions were performed with primers CPR3 and CPR7.
This amplicon was completely sequenced and was found
to be homologous to CPR genes by BLAST analysis. We
named this gene crtR and designed specific crtR primers.

A cDNA library was screened for the X. dendrorhous crtR
cDNA, and a recombinant plasmid, pcXDA.44.29, was
isolated, which contained a 2,680 bp insert corresponding
to the cDNA of the crtR gene [GenBank:EU884134]. We
used this cDNA sequence for specific primer design (primers CPREx1fwdb and CPREx1rev, Table 3) from the
remaining crtR gene sequence, and this allowed the isolation of the pPR32.AA.51 plasmid from the YIp5 genomic
library. pPR32.AA.51 contains the promoter and 5' region
of the first exon of the crtR gene. Sequence analysis indicated that the 5' region of the crtR gene is at one end of the
4.5 kb BamHI DNA fragment.

The YIp5 genomic library was screened for the X. dendrorhous crtR gene by PCR [6], and one recombinant plasmid carrying the crtR gene (pPR52.P.44) was isolated.
This plasmid contained a DNA insert of approximately
12.8 kb, carrying six BamHI fragments of 5.4 kb, 4.4 kb,
0.9 kb (doublet), 0.8 kb and 0.4 kb. Each fragment was
sub-cloned into the pBluescript SK- vector for sequencing.
The sequence analysis showed that the crtR gene was in
one end of the 5.4 kb fragment (pCPR1.3), but it was
incomplete. The promoter region and part of the first exon
were missing due to the presence of a BamHI site in the
crtR gene.

The in silico DNA sequence analysis of the inserts from
pPR32.AA.51 and pPR52.P.44 indicated that the crtR gene
is entirely contained in a 5.9 kb SalI DNA fragment. This
result was corroborated by Southern blot hybridization
(data not shown). The recombinant plasmid pCPRB.6,
which contains an insert of 5,896 bp that harbors the crtR
gene, was isolated from a partial SalI genomic library. The
complete crtR gene sequence [GenBank:EU884133] is displayed in Figure 1.

Localization of the crtR gene in the yeast electrophoretic
karyotype
To study the crtR gene's genomic organization, its localization in the electrophoretic karyotype of the UCD 67–
385 strain was performed by Southern blot hybridization.
The results showed that the crtR gene is in the first two
chromosomal bands (Figure 2), where each band corresponds to a triplet [21]. As it was recently demonstrated
that this strain is diploid [30], it is possible to conclude
that the crtR gene is in at least two chromosomes and
could be homologous polymorphic. In different X. dendrorhous strains, a high chromosomal polymorphism has
been revealed [31], so it is possible that these homologous
chromosomes have experienced genetic rearrangement,
thus explaining their different sizes.
Sequence analysis of crtR gene
The crtR gene consists of three exons of 222, 317 and 1702
bp and two introns of 240 and 138 bp. This gene encodes
a 746 amino acid protein (Figure 3) with a predicted
molecular weight of 81.9 kDa. CrtR has 22 hydrophobic
amino acids in its amino terminal region, a typical transmembrane segment of known CPRs that anchors the protein to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane in the cell
[32]. CrtR also has recognizable CPR conserved domains
such as a FMN binding domain, a FAD binding domain
between amino acids 275 and 512, and a NAD(P)H binding domain between amino acids 582 and 709. The flavodoxin signature, which is only found in certain bacteria
and algae, was identified between amino acids 80 and

222. However, the FMN binding domain of CPRs is
homologous to bacterial flavodoxins [33]. Two putative
P450-binding regions (P450-1 and P450-2) have been
suggested [32], and one (P450-2) was studied by sitedirected mutagenesis in rat CPR where the importance of
acidic amino acid residues in this region was demonstrated [34]. The corresponding regions in CrtR were characterized by the presence of acidic amino acids (aspartic
acid at positions: 112, 117, 122, 127, 210, 211, 218;
glutamic acid at positions: 114, 115, 119, 126, 216, 217).
The aspartic acid residues at position 210, 211 and 218 are
extremely conserved in all known CPRs [32]. The P450
binding regions are located in the FMN binding domain.
This is consistent with the electron flow from NAD(P)H to
FAD to FMN and finally to the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase enzyme.
A phylogenetic comparison was performed using available fungal CPR protein sequences in the database by the
Neighbor Joining method after 1000 replications of bootstrap analysis (Figure 4). The phylogenetic tree shows the
evolutionary relationship of CrtR and allows the differentiation of three fungal clusters: Basidomycota, Ascomycota and Zygomycota. CrtR from X. dendrorhous is most
closely related to the basidomycetes C. versicolor and to P.
chrysosporium, with sequence identities of 60.2% and
58.3%, respectively.
Expression of crtR gene
The relationship between the crtS and crtR gene expression along the growth curve at the mRNA level was studied in the wild type UCD 67–385 X. dendrorhous strain,
grown in MMV supplemented with glucose as a fermentable carbon source. It was observed that crtS mRNA level
reaches a maximum at 66 h of cultivation, equivalent to
approximately half of the exponential growth phase.
However, the levels of crtR mRNA remained constant
along the growth curve (Figure 5). Despite the fact that
both proteins are involved in the same stage of astaxanthin biosynthesis, there is no relationship, at the mRNA
level, in their gene expression. It is possible to conclude
that the two genes are not regulated in the same way at the
transcriptional level.

According to this last result, in other work done in our laboratory, a dramatic decrease of transcripts levels from the
crtYB, crtI and crtS genes (carotenogenic genes) was
observed during the stationary phase [35]. This was not
the case for the idi and crtE genes, where the level of the idi
transcript showed a slight decline and the crtE transcript
remained constant during the stationary phase. This suggests the presence of higher levels of the enzymes IPP isomerase and GGPP synthase at this stage. This situation
would allow for the flow of the isoprenoid precursors
towards carotenoid biosynthesis, as well as other meta-

bolic pathways such as ergosterol biosynthesis [35]. Similarly, the absence of a relationship between the pattern of
crtR gene expression and the rest of the carotenogenic
genes suggests the existence of a different regulatory
mechanism for crtR gene expression due to its involvement in other metabolic pathways of the yeast.
An example of cpr gene regulation has been described for
Aspergillus niger. In this case, it was observed that the regulation of cpr gene expression was particularly complex in
the P450-CPR system involved in benzoate hydroxylation
[36]. In addition to benzoate induction at the transcriptional level, there were other regulatory mechanisms such
as differential promoter use and post-translational regulatory mechanisms [36]. The decoupling of a P450-CPR system would imply the release of electrons to the cytoplasm
that could generate active oxygen molecules, so a strict
regulation of CPR is of vital importance for the cell. Similarly, it is not surprising that the crtS and crtR genes are
regulated differently because, as mentioned earlier, several genes for different cytochrome P450 enzymes can
exist in an organism, but generally there is a single gene
for a unique cytochrome P450 reductase. Therefore, complex regulation for CrtR protein expression is necessary to
adjust the levels of cytochrome P450 reductase activity in
a cell with different levels of diverse cytochrome P450
proteins.

Functional study of the crtR gene
The participation of the crtR gene product in the formation of astaxanthin from β-carotene was studied in a bacterial heterologous system. For this, the DS1B E. coli strain
(Table 1) was transformed with a pET101/D-TOPO
expression vector carrying the cDNA of crtS and crtR genes
from X. dendrorhous, and the carotenoid production was
analyzed by RP-HPLC. This system was not successful, as
it was not possible to produce any xanthophylls in the
bacteria. A similar situation was observed in another
study, where only canthaxanthin (β-carotene-4, 4'-dione,
which is an intermediate in the conversion of β-carotene
into astaxanthin) in very small quantities was produced
when the S. cerevisiae cpr gene was used [12]. These
authors concluded that the X. dendrorhous astaxanthin
synthase has very low activity in E. coli [12]. It should be
noted that the P450 systems are associated with membranes; therefore, E. coli may not provide a proper environment for its functionality. Recently, it was reported
that several attempts to produce carotenoids in E. coli
using the X. dendrorhous carotenogenic genes resulted in
poor enzyme expression and carotenoid production [37].
Hence, a eukaryotic system would be more appropriate to
attempt the expression of X. dendrorhous carotenogenic
genes.

Arabidopsis thaliana: [GenBank:A75959].

As the E. coli expression system was not successful, in
order to demonstrate the importance of the crtR gene in
the astaxanthin biosynthetic pathway, X. dendrorhous crtR
deletion mutant strains were generated. The wild type
strains UCD 67–385 and CBS-6938 were transformed
with the linearized plasmid pBsiWIΔcrtR::hph and circular
plasmid pNdeIΔcrtR::hph, respectively. Through homologous recombination events, the wild type crtR gene in the
wild type strains was exchanged by the DNA fragment
containing the deletion and resistance marker (Figure 6).
Through this experiment, a yellow (CBSTr, which derives
from CBS-6938) and a pale red-orange (T13, which
derives from UCD 67–385) hygromycin B resistant trans-

formant strains were obtained. The color phenotype of
these transformants is an indicator of an alteration in
astaxanthin biosynthesis because astaxanthin has a strong
red-orange color. The strain UCD 67–385 is diploid [30];
therefore, we suggest that T13 is heterozygote for the crtR
gene, with a mutant and a wild type allele. Moreover, by a
gene-dose effect, T13 produces less astaxanthin and accumulates more β-carotene than its parental wild type strain.
On the other hand, the ploidy level of CBS-6938 is
unknown. However, based on random mutagenesis
results with physical and chemical mutagens performed
in our laboratory (data not shown) and transformation
with carotenogenic genes [38], it was concluded that this
strain could be haploid. The mutagenesis results suggest

that, in the case of CBSTr, the only crtR gene copy is
mutated and, therefore, it is not capable of producing
astaxanthin and accumulates β-carotene.
In order to confirm the T13 (crtRΔBsiWI::hph/crtR+) and
CBSTr (crtRΔNdeI::hph) transformant genotype modifications, PCR reactions were performed using specific primers for the crtR and hph genes (Table 2), and genomic DNA
samples from wild type and transformant strains were
used as templates. The amplicon sequences validated the
representation shown in Figure 6. The results indicated
that the CBS-6938 strain has one crtR gene copy and its
deletion is not lethal. In the case of T13, it was shown that
it is heterozygote for the crtR gene, having a wild type and
a mutant allele, which supports the gene-dose effect
hypothesis in the production of astaxanthin. These results
were also corroborated by Southern blot hybridization
(data not shown).

Several attempts were performed to obtain a β-carotene
accumulating transformant derived from UCD 67–385.
T13 was retransformed with a DNA fragment harboring a
crtR gene deletion and a G418 resistance cassette marker.
No G418 resistant transformants were obtained. In order
to produce a homozygous crtR mutation, T13 was subjected to the Double Recombinant Method [6], but it was
not possible to obtain a double mutant strain for the crtR
gene.
The cpr gene deletion in S. cerevisiae was not lethal, suggesting the existence of an alternative electron donor such
as a cytochrome b5 (cytb5) [39]. When a cytb5 deletion in
the wild type was done, no new phenotype was generated.
However, it was lethal when cytb5 and cpr were simultaneously disrupted. This result demonstrated that, in mutants
with single disruptions of cpr or cytb5, both enzymes can
complement each other [39]. Likewise, the disruption of
the cpr gene from the fungus Gibberella fujikuroi was not

lethal, proving the existence of another electron donor
[16]. In light of these results and evidence for the existence
of a high level of polymorphisms in different X. dendrorhous strains [21,30,31], we suggest that both wild type
strains may have a different genetic background. Moreover, the results obtained in this work suggest that, in the
CBS-6938 wild type strain, an alternative electron donor
such as a cytochrome b5 may exist because the crtR gene
disruption was not lethal. On the other hand, this is not
the case for the UCD 67–385 strain due to the impossibility to obtain a homozygous mutant for the crtR gene.
However, the possible alternative electron donor in the
CBS-6938 strain cannot support astaxanthin synthesis, as
the crtR gene mutant (CBSTr) accumulates β-carotene.

To check the carotenoid composition, total pigments were
extracted from both wild type and transformant strains,
and the composition was analyzed by RP-HPLC (Figure 7
and Table 4). The RP-HPLC analysis showed that the carotenoid composition is completely different between
transformants and their parental strain. CBSTr accumulates β-carotene and is unable to synthesize astaxanthin.
T13 has a reduced astaxanthin production at the expense
of increased β-carotene production, which is the astaxanthin precursor.

Conclusion
A new crtR gene has been isolated and characterized from
X. dendrorhous, which plays an auxiliary role to the crtS
gene and is also essential for astaxanthin biosynthesis.
This gene consists of three exons, and is localized in at
least two chromosomes of the UCD 67–385 X. dendrorhous wild type strain. crtR encodes a 746 amino acid
protein with characteristic domains of cytochrome P450
reductases (FMN, FAD and NAD(P)H binding domains)
and a small amino terminal transmembrane region.
Although both crtS and crtR proteins participate in the
same stage of yeast carotenogenesis, the mRNA level pattern from these genes along the growth curve is different.
Thus, both genes are regulated in a different manner at the
transcriptional level.
