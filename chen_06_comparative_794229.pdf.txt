Abstract
Background: HSP90 proteins are essential molecular chaperones involved in signal transduction,
cell cycle control, stress management, and folding, degradation, and transport of proteins. HSP90
proteins have been found in a variety of organisms suggesting that they are ancient and conserved.
In this study we investigate the nuclear genomes of 32 species across all kingdoms of organisms,
and all sequences available in GenBank, and address the diversity, evolution, gene structure,
conservation and nomenclature of the HSP90 family of genes across all organisms.
Results: Twelve new genes and a new type HSP90C2 were identified. The chromosomal location,
exon splicing, and prediction of whether they are functional copies were documented, as well as
the amino acid length and molecular mass of their polypeptides. The conserved regions across all
protein sequences, and signature sequences in each subfamily were determined, and a standardized
nomenclature system for this gene family is presented. The proeukaryote HSP90 homologue,
HTPG, exists in most Bacteria species but not in Archaea, and it evolved into three lineages
(Groups A, B and C) via two gene duplication events. None of the organellar-localized HSP90s
were derived from endosymbionts of early eukaryotes. Mitochondrial TRAP and endoplasmic
reticulum HSP90B separately originated from the ancestors of HTPG Group A in Firmicutes-like
organisms very early in the formation of the eukaryotic cell. TRAP is monophyletic and present in
all Animalia and some Protista species, while HSP90B is paraphyletic and present in all eukaryotes
with the exception of some Fungi species, which appear to have lost it. Both HSP90C (chloroplast
HSP90C1 and location-undetermined SP90C2) and cytosolic HSP90A are monophyletic, and
originated from HSP90B by independent gene duplications. HSP90C exists only in Plantae, and was
duplicated into HSP90C1 and HSP90C2 isoforms in higher plants. HSP90A occurs across all
eukaryotes, and duplicated into HSP90AA and HSP90AB in vertebrates. Diplomonadida was
identified as the most basal organism in the eukaryote lineage.
Conclusion: The present study presents the first comparative genomic study and evolutionary
analysis of the HSP90 family of genes across all kingdoms of organisms. HSP90 family members
underwent multiple duplications and also subsequent losses during their evolution. This study
established an overall framework of information for the family of genes, which may facilitate and
stimulate the study of this gene family across all organisms.

Background
HSP90 proteins, named according to the 90 kDa average
molecular mass of their members, are highly conserved
molecular chaperones that account for 1–2% of all cellular proteins in most cells under non-stress conditions [1].
They participate in the regulation of the stress response
[2,3] and, when associated with other co-chaperones,
function in correctly folding newly synthesized proteins,
stabilizing and refolding denatured proteins after stress,
preventing misfolding and aggregation of unfolded or
partially folded proteins, and assisting in protein transport across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and organellar membranes [4-8]. HSP90 members have key roles in
the maturation of signal transduction proteins, like hormone receptors, various kinases, nitric oxide synthase and
calcineurin [9-13]. Through these substrates, they regulate
diverse cellular processes. The combination of these functions appears to result in a role as a capacitor of phenotypic variation: decreasing cytosolic HSP90 function in
Drosophila melanogaster and Arabidopsis thaliana results in
the appearance of phenotypes that depend on the genetic
background but which would normally be cryptic [7,14].
HSP90 expression is also associated with many types of
tumors including breast cancer, pancreatic carcinoma,
human leukemia, systemic lupus erythematosus, as well
as multidrug resistance [1]. HSP90 inhibition provides a
recently developed, important pharmacological platform
for anticancer therapy [15].
Most Eubacteria were thought to have a single homologue
of HSP90 known as HTPG (high temperature protein G),
located on the chromosomal genome, whereas Archaebacteria lack a HSP90 representative [16,17]. In eukaryotes all HSP90 genes are located on the nuclear genome,
but their proteins function in the cytosol, ER, chloroplast
and mitochondria [1,18,19]. The cytosolic members,
called HSP90 (90 kDa heat-shock protein) in the sensu
stricto appear in two major isoforms, Hsp90-α (inducible
form) and Hsp90-β (constitutive form) [1,20,21]. These
two isoforms are the result of a gene duplication about
500 million years ago [22]. The ER member, generally
called Grp94 (94-kDa glucose-regulated protein), was
thought to exist in all eukaryotes except fungi, which
appear to have lost it, and was suggested to have originated via gene duplication very early in eukaryote evolution [23]. A chloroplast homologue that is most similar in
sequence to ER Grp94 has been found in three plant species [17,24]. The mitochondrial homologue, TRAP
(tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein), is
most closely related to Eubacterial HTPG sequences,
which suggests it originated from a HTPG-like ancestor
[17,25]. As a distinctive feature, TRAP possesses a unique
LxCxE motif that is absent in all other HSP90 family

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/156

members, and depends on stress kinases for its transcriptional activation [26].
There have been several studies that attempt to draw the
phylogenetic relationships across all HSP90 family members [17,23,24,27]. However, due to the limited number
of sequences used, and the lack of genome-wide information, the diversity of HSP90 family members and their
evolutionary relationships are still not completely
resolved.
The evolution of protein-coding genes is frequently
applied to infer patterns of organismal evolution, but
gene trees are sometimes not consistent with species trees.
One problem that can be encountered, especially when
using genes that belong to a large gene family, is the use
of paralogous instead of orthologous gene copies in phylogenetic reconstruction. Using information from complete genomes, however, and including all known family
members minimizes this problem. Because the Hsp90
family of proteins exists in all organisms except Archaea
[23], and because they are quite conserved, they provide
an excellent model for understanding the evolutionary
pattern of the majority of life on our planet. In the present
study we analyzed 32 complete genomes, across all kingdoms of life, and retrieved all HSP90 family of sequences
available within these genomes. In addition, we investigated the complete genomes of 18 and 99 further species
of Archaea and Bacteria, respectively. We aimed to: 1)
determine the diversity and distribution of HSP90 family
members throughout all organisms, 2) document the
chromosomal location and exon splicing patterns of
HSP90 genes, and the amino acid (a.a.) length and molecular mass of HSP90 proteins, and predict whether these
genes are functional, 3) identify the conserved regions and
the signature sequences of each class of HSP90 family
members, 4) analyze the evolution of the gene family
members throughout all kingdoms of organisms, 5) provide a case-study of the use of these proteins for addressing the phylogenetic relationship of all organisms, and 6)
propose a standardized nomenclature system for the
members of this gene family based on our earlier work
[28]. This study establishes an overall framework of information for the family of HSP90 genes, which may facilitate and stimulate the study of this gene family across all
organisms.

Results
Diversity and nomenclature of the HSP90 family of genes
There are a total of 103 genes belonging to the HSP90
family on the 32 genomes analyzed (Table 1, Table 2).
Out of these 103 genes, 87 are putative functional genes
and 16 are pseudogenes, based on functional motif/
domain analysis (see the following section). Twelve genes
are newly predicted in the study, and 2 protein sequences

are newly deduced from mRNA sequences available in
databases. The new sequences are in Additional File 1. The
number of HSP90 family members is highest on vertebrate genomes, with a total of 4–16 genes, followed by
Plantae with 3–8 genes, invertebrates (including "invertebrate" Deuterostomes, Ecdysozoans and Lophotrochozoans) with 3–5 genes, Protista with 2–4 genes, and
Bacteria with only 0–2 genes (Table 1). In Archaea, only

Methanosarcina mazei has a HSP90-like gene, and in
viruses, there is no HSP90 homologue.
Due to the limit of sequences that PSI-BLAST database
searching can report, the 6 query sequences used to probe
the databases (see Methods) each retrieved 1000 similar
sequences with the statistical significance threshold of
0.005. Removal of redundant sequences from the collec-

tion of 6000 sequences resulted in 1015 protein
sequences that came from different submissions. From
these, 452 complete sequences were confirmed to belong
to the family, through similarity comparison after
sequence alignment, and subsequently used for the analysis of protein features. From these complete sequences,
197 representative sequences, distributed across 146 species, and 128 genera in Archaea, Bacteria, Protista, Plantae, Fungi and Animalia, were selected for phylogenetic
analysis. We established three-letter abbreviations of their
species names (Table 3) that were used throughout this
study.
We divided the gene family into five subfamilies named
HSP90A, HSP90B, HSP90C, TRAP and HTPG. Our earlier

study proposed a new nomenclature system for the
HSP90 family of genes on the human genome [28], which
was approved by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee [29]. The system uses the root names HSP90A,
HSP90B, and TRAP to indicate cytosolic, ER, and mitochondrial HSP90 homologues, respectively. HSP90A was
further divided into two classes: HSP90AA for conventional Hsp90-alpha and HSP90AB for Hsp90-beta. Following Schroda [30] we used HSP90C to name the
homologues found in the chloroplast. The present study
retains the nomenclature system above (which is strongly
supported in our analysis below) and also retains the conventional name for the bacterial homologue of HSP90,
HTPG. Following the guidelines for human and mouse
gene nomenclature [31,32], we used a number following

the conserved residues/motifs present throughout all
HSP90 members, and being significantly longer (982 a.a.)
than bacterial HTPGs (588–681 a.a.). When blasting this
sequence against the protein database in GenBank, we
found that its closest relatives exist in bacteria (e.g. Rhodopseudomonas palustris, ZP_00811094.1, 26% identity;
Frankia sp., ZP_00568340.1, 26% identity). We decided
to use this HSP90-like protein and one of its bacterial relatives as outgroups to HTPG members.

The single-exon HTPG genes are present in a variable
number of copies across the 109 complete bacterial
genomes investigated. Five species have two copies of
HTPG, 79 species have a single copy, and 25 species have
no homologous HTPG genes. Presence or absence of
HTPG on a particular genome is not strongly correlated
with membership in any one bacterial group. For
instance, whereas in Cyanobacteria and Spirochaeteles,
HTPG exists in all species investigated, and in Lactobacillales and Mollicutes no HTPG was identified in any of the
species investigated, in the genera Corynebacterium, Bacillus and Haemophilus, HTPG was only found in some species but not in others.
TRAP genes have 3–19 exons and are present only in Animalia. HSP90C genes have 10–21 exons and only exist in
Plantae. HSP90B genes have 1–18 exons and exist in all
species of Protista, Plantae and Animalia, and some species in Fungi. HSP90A genes have 1–12 exons and exist in
all eukaryotic kingdoms. HSP90A were divided into two
subdivisions, HSP90AA and HSP90AB (Table 1) in Vertebrates, and HSP90C was divided into HSP90C1 and
HSP90C2 in Plantae. The exon splicing patterns of representative members of the HSP90 family are shown in Figure 1.

Protein features and conserved regions
A total of 456 complete amino acid sequences (452 available in databases and 4 newly predicted) can be reliably
aligned, and the alignment of representative sequences
from each of the 5 subfamilies is shown in Figure 1. Based
on the overall alignment, we divided the protein sequence
into 3 conserved regions (I, II and III) and four variable
regions (A, B, C and D). In a previous study, Obermann
and others [33] divided HSP90 protein sequences into
five domains: the N-terminal domain [(HSA)HSP90AA1
residues 1–236], Charged domain 1 (237–271), Middle
domain (272–617), Charged domain 2 (618–628) and Cterminal domain (629–732). In order to characterize the
difference between subfamilies based on the overall alignment, we made further subdivisions to the domains mentioned above. We divided the N-terminal domain into the
Variable regions A [(HSA)HSP90AA1 residues 1–17] and
Conserved region I (18–224), identified a new Conserved
region II (290–617) for the Middle domain, and a new
Variable region C (618–628) for the Charged domain 2,
and divided the C-terminal domain into the Conserved
region III (629–699) and Variable regions D (670–
732)(Fig 1). We also replaced the Charged domain 1
(237–271) by the extended Variable region B (225–289)
in order to reflect the sequence variation found in our
alignment for this area.

The residues that are conserved across all members of a
subfamily or across all HSP90 family members, and that
function as signature sequences, are summarized below
(see also Figure 2 and Table 4). HTPG genes, like most
bacterial genes, have only one exon. Their proteins are
588–681 a.a. long, have no signal peptide, and lack the
Variable regions A, B and D (Figure 2). This subfamily of
proteins are the shortest in the HSP90 family, with molecular mass 66.7–78.0 kDa (Table 1), and are also the most
variable with no recognizable signature sequences.

TRAP, HSP90C and HSP90B proteins possess a signal peptide that allows their export into mitochondria, chloroplasts, and ER, respectively [1,19] (Figure 1). TRAP genes
have 3–19 exons, their proteins lack the Variable regions
B and D, and their mature protein sequences are 644–687
a.a. long with a molecular mass of 74.8–77.9 kDa (Figure
1, Table 1). Five conserved motifs can each distinguish
TRAP members from other subfamily members (Table 4).
HSP90C genes have 10–21 exons. Their proteins have a
shorter Variable region B relative to HSP90A and HSP90B,
are 756–785 a.a. long, and have a molecular mass of

Alignment of representative amino acid sequences of the HSP90 family of proteins, showing their conserved/variable regions,
functionally important residues, and functional domains. Amino acid residues completely conserved throughout the HSP90
family are shaded in red, and those conserved throughout each subfamily are in green. The regions that distinguish HTPG
Groups A, B and C are shaded in yellow. Gaps are marked with"-", the last residue in each line is assigned a number and subfamily names are indicated at the end of each line. The conserved/variable regions are separated by "||" with the names above
the alignment, and the cleavage sites located just before the underlined residues. "▼" stands for the functionally important residues experimentally identified: E47 (refers to HSP90AA1) for ATP hydrolysis; D93 for ATP binding [33]; G95, G132, G135,
G137, and G183 for both GA and p23 binding; K112 for GA binding [72]; R400 and Q404 for ATPase activity; F369 for interdomain interaction [63]; S231 and S263 for phosphorylation by casein kinase II [74]. The conserved and functional domains are
indicated by: "≈" for HSP90 protein family signature; "=" for HSP90 protein; "~" for histidine kinase-like ATPases; "∞" for fourhelical cytokine; and "..." for Glutamic acid-rich region. The number of each sequence represents: 1. (HSA)HSP90AA1, 2.

84.2–89.0 kDa in their mature status. Eight unique motifs
can distinguish HSP90C members from other subfamily
members (Table 4). HSP90B genes have 1–18 exons. Their
proteins have a shorter Variable region B relative to
HSP90A, and are 695–800 a.a. long with a molecular
mass of 79.5–91.5 kDa in mature status. We cannot find
a completely conserved motif that alone distinguishes
HSP90B proteins from the others but the simultaneous
presence of three conserved motifs, as a group, can separate these proteins from other family members. A fourth
motif, the most-C-terminal motif KDEL of HSP90B, previously used as the signature motif for members of this subfamily, and thought to be the ER retention signal, was
here found to be not completely conserved across all
HSP90B subfamily members. With the exception of the L
residue, which is conserved across all sequences examined, at the K site, 38.7% of the sequences in our aligment
had an H, A, E, R, S or N residue instead. At the D site, G
or N appeared in several cases [e.g. (TCR)HSP90B1,
(SMA)AAF66929.1], and at the E site, this residue was
replaced by a D in a few cases [e.g. (LML)XP_847734.1].
HSP90A genes have 1–12 exons. Their proteins have a
very short Variable region A but a full-length Variable
region B, and they are 689–854 a.a. long with molecular
mass of 78.3–98.1 kDa in mature status. Eleven conserved
motifs can each distinguish HSP90A proteins from other
subfamily members (Table 4). The MEEVD motif at the Cterminal end was considered functional and characteristic
of cytosolic HSP90 [23]. This motif is quite conserved but
there are exceptions. In several cases the second E can be a
Q or a K [e.g. (TCR)HSP90A1, (DDI)HSP90A1], and its D

is absent in (CIN)HSP90A1. HSP90AB sequences can be
easily distinguished from HSP90AA sequences by the
former having a unique LKID motif, and the latter having
7 unique motifs (Table 4, Figure 1). There are, however, a
small number of intermediate type sequences that fall
between the typical HSP90AA and HSP90AB (Figure 4).
Seventeen a.a. residues are completely conserved throughout all sequences (Table 4). These residues as well as various conserved/functional domains shared by all HSP90
members may be fulfilling HSP90-specific functions.
InterProScan and ScanProsite searches explored such
domains (Figure 1). The "HSP90 protein" sequence [residues 196–732 in (HSA)HSP90AA1, document # PF00183
of InterPro database] exists in all HSP90 sequences. There
are several smaller "signature" sequences (residues 18–61,
88–123, 131–153 and 182–218, InterPro doc PR00775),
an ATP-binding domain (residues 40–193, ATPases, InterPro doc PF02518 and SM00387), a Glutamic acid-rich
motif (residues 223–268, PROSITE doc PS50313), and a
four-helical cytokine region (residues 518–668, InterPro
doc SSF47266) (Figure 1). Other domains/motifs that
occur in some of these HSP90 a.a. sequences include a
Lysine-rich domain (PROSITE doc PS50318), a Protein
kinase C phosphorylation site (PROSITE doc PS0005), a
Casein kinase II phosphorylation site (PROSITE doc
PS0006), a N-glycosylation site (PROSITE doc PS0001), a
Tyrosine kinase phosphorylation site (PROSITE doc
PS0007), a Tyrosine sulfation site (PROSITE doc PS0003),
a cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site (PROSITE doc PS0004), a N-myristoylation

Phylogenetic relationships
Out of the 197 sequences selected for the phylogenetic
analysis, 63 belong to HTPG, 15 to TRAP, 6 to HSP90C,
31 to HSP90B, and 78 to HSP90A. In order to maximize
the number of characters that are alignable within and

across closely related subfamily members, we divided
these sequences into 2 subsets, HTPG+TRAP, and
HSP90A+B+C, and deleted the smaller non-alignable
regions in each of these alignments. A total of 595 of 624
a.a [refer to (ECO)HTPG1] in the HTPG+TRAP alignment
and 679 of 732 a.a. [refer to (HSA)HSP90AA1] in the
HSP90A+B+C alignment were finally used in the analysis.

basal sequence within the HSP90A+B+C ingroup, but
without >50% bootstrap support.

The analysis of HTPG+TRAP data led to a single most parsimonious tree (Figure 3), with tree length = 15337, consistency index (CI) = 0.362, homoplasy index (HI) =
0.638, retention index (RI) = 0.527, and rescaled consistency index (RC) = 0.190. Eighty-four of the total 601 a.a.
characters were constant, 117 were parsimony-uninformative and 584 were parsimony- informative. Based
on the tree topology, we divided the protein sequences
into three main groups, Groups A, B, and C. Sequence
length differences in four different positions along the
alignment can differentiate the members of these three
groups (Figure 1). Our Groups B and C were strongly supported with 99% and 80% bootstrap values, respectively,
whereas Group A was only moderately supported with a
54% bootstrap value. Group B+C was supported with a
71% bootstrap value. Groups B and C comprise only
HTPG proteins, whereas Group A includes most HTPG,
and all HSP90A, HSP90B, HSP90C and TRAP proteins. In
Group A, HSP90A+B+C was a strongly supported monophyly with a 94% bootstrap value, and with Firmicutes
HTPG proteins being the clade's closest relatives. TRAP
proteins are monophyletic, supported with a 67% bootstrap value and also have Firmicutes HTPG proteins as
their closest relative. Spirochaetales HSP90 proteins are
found in all three groups, those from γ-proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria are found in Groups A and C,
and those from Bacteroidetes are found in Groups B and
C. The most parsimonious tree (10282 steps, CI = 0.372,
HI = 0.628, RI = 0.680, RC = 0.253) for the HSP90A+B+C
alignment is shown in Figure 4. Out of 681 total characters, 38 are constant, 93 are parsimony-uninformative and
605 are parsimony-informative. The nodes for HSP90A,
HSP90C and ingroup (HSP90A+B+C) are all strongly supported with bootstrap values of 83%, 94% and 90%,
respectively. In vertebrates HSP90A has duplicated into
HSP90AA and HSP90AB, both clades supported with high
bootstrap values (96% and 94%), but there are some
intermediate sequences that according to their signature
sequences should belong to HSP90AA but that in this
analysis fall at the base of the HSP90AB clade. The
HSP90A monophyletic clades that evolved within Animalia, Plantae, and Fungi are all well supported by bootstrap
values of 96%, 66% and 80%, respectively, and at the base
of these clades are HSP90A subfamily members belonging
to the Protista. (GIN)BAD83616.1 of Diplomonadida is
at the root of the Eukaryote members. HSP90B is not a
monophyletic clade, and it originated earlier relative to
HSP90A. HSP90C originated from HSP90B, and duplicated into HSP90C1 and HSP90C2 in higher plants with
100% and 98% bootstrap support, respectively.
(CNE)HSP90B1 of Fungi did not cluster with the Animalia sequences, as expected. Instead it appeared as the most

Discussion
Diversity, distinctive features and nomenclature of HSP90
family of genes
The present study presents the first comparative genomic
study and evolutionary analysis of the HSP90 family of
genes across all kingdoms of organisms. Based on the phylogeny of their proteins and the cell compartments the
proteins function in, we divided the gene family into 5
subfamilies, HSP90A, HSP90B, HSP90C, TRAP, and
HTPG, and established a new nomenclature system. This
system may serve as a model for the nomenclature of
other chaperone gene families (e.g. HSP100, HSP70,
HSP60, and small HSP). HSP90A and HSP90B exist in all
eukaryotic kingdoms, whereas HTPG, TRAP and HSP90C
occur only in Bacteria, Animalia, and Plantae, respectively. HSP90A duplicated into HSP90AA and HSP90AB
in vertebrates, and HSP90C duplicated into HSP90C1 and
HSP90C2 in higher plants.

Seventeen completely conserved a.a. residues serve as
markers to recognize any HSP90 family member, whereas
membership into each subfamily is assigned by additional specific signature motifs, with the exception of
HTPG subfamily members.
From the 32 complete genomes investigated we found
that the number of exons in HSP90 genes range from 1 to
21, the mature a.a. length from 588 to 854 residues, and
the molecular mass of mature proteins from 66.7 to 98.1
kDa. The HSP90 family of genes (with the exception of
HTPG, and some HSP90A and HSP90B genes) contain a
large number of introns. These data contradict earlier
work [34] that suggested that HSP genes generally lacked
introns, which would facilitate their rapid expression
while avoiding incorrect RNA spicing due to heat stress.
Other HSP families of genes have not been systematically
studied, and possibly that some genes in these families
also contain introns.
HTPG subfamily of genes and the origin of HSP90
The alignment and phylogeny of HTPG proteins divided
them into three groups, each containing unique signature
sequence and high or moderate bootstrap support. Importantly, our genomic study showed that at least 5 species of
Bacteria (e.g. Streptomyces coelicolor and Bacteroides fragilis)
each have two HTPG gene copies, each copy belonging to
different groups. Each HTPG group also contains representatives of Spirochaetales, γ-proteobacteria, Firmicutes,
Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes. Unlike the proteins in
other subfamilies, HTPG proteins are so divergent that
they do not have a common signature sequence. Our data
suggest that HTPG underwent two separate gene duplica-

tion events during its evolution (Fig 5A). Because the evolutionary origin and diversification of proeukaryotes is
not yet resolved with certainty [35-37], this limits our
ability to discuss the evolution of HTPG. Stechman and
Cavalier-Smith [17] rooted their tree using a single and
incomplete Ecobacteria (Chloroflexus aurantiacus) HTPG
copy and did not consider HTPG gene duplication events.
As a result, they placed TRAP close to the base of all
HSP90 family members. We decided to root the HSP90
tree based on an ancient gene duplication event. Our
genome searches identified HSP90-like proteins that exist
in Archaea and Bacteria. They are most similar to HTPG
proteins but do not have the conserved marker residues
characteristic of all HSP90 family members. Using these
HSP90-like sequences at the root of the tree, we postulate
a gene duplication event that produced Group C
sequences at the base of the HSP90 family tree, and a
sequence that gave rise, via another duplication event to
Groups A and B (Fig 5A). This scenario is supported by the
presence of 4 variable regions in HTPG proteins (Fig 1),
where the sequence length in each of these regions
increases from Group C to Groups A and B. In additional
support for this hypothesis is the observation that Group
A sequences and all eukaryote homologues have 2 common signature sequences. This hypothesis needs to be further addressed when more genome sequences, especially
those from basal bacteria, become available.
In order to identify the type of organism where HSP90
proteins originated we observe that not all bacterial

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/156

groups (e.g. Lactobacillales and Mollicutes) have HTPG
genes on their genomes, and neither does Archaea. If we
assume that Archaea and gram-positive bacteria are the
most ancient lineages within prokaryotes [35], then
HSP90 proteins could have arisen within a Bacterial lineage that later gave rise to the eukaryotic cell. If we assume,
however, that Archaea is a derived lineage from gram-positive bacteria [36,37], then HTPG proteins originated
before the origin of Archaea, but were subsequently lost in
this lineage. It will be possible to elucidate these two alternatives when the origin of the tree of life is better understood. Also, present-day bacteria taxonomy [38] is not
completely consistent with our tree topology for HTPG
proteins. HSP90 genes might provide a handle to elucidate bacterial evolution and taxonomy in future work.
TRAP subfamily of genes
Consistent with Emelyanov [24] and Stechmann and Cavalier-Smith [17], our data suggests that TRAP evolved
from within the ancestral eukaryotes, and was not derived
from an endosymbiont of bacterial origin. In support of
this claim we observed that TRAP1 protein (from Humans
and Drosophila) is encoded on the nuclear genome but
localizes to the mitochondria due to a mitochondrial
localization sequence in their N-terminus [18]. In some
instances, TRAP homologues have also been found to
localize to the cytosol or the nucleus [39,40]. On the other
hand, phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial genes
including both small and large subunit rRNA and Cob and
Cox1, suggested that mitochondria monophyletically

indicate gene duplication events. A) We propose that HSP90-like genes in Bacteria and Archaea are basal to HTPG genes that
only exist in Bacteria. HTPG genes underwent two gene duplication events that gave rise to three groups (Group A, B and C).
B) Eukaryotic members were derived from HTPG Group A, and evolved into four subfamilies TRAP (mitochondrial), HSP90A
(cytosolic), HSP90B (ER) and HSP90C (chloroplast) throughout three gene duplication events. One additional gene duplication
event led to the division of HSP90A into HSP90AA and HSP90AB in vertebrates. The organismal groups in parenthesis indicate
where these HSP90 gene copies are found.

arose from within a-proteobacteria [41,42]. Our phylogeny suggests that TRAP is monophyletic, and its sister lineage is a sequence from Desulfitobacterium hafniense a
Fimicutes bacterium, not a a-proteobacteria. In Bacteria
Group A, Fimicutes proteins are sister proteins to both the
TRAP clade of proteins and to the HSP90A+B+C clade,
which suggests a gene duplication event happened early
in Group A (Fig 5B). TRAP proteins are most similar to
eukaryote HTPG, both lacking Variable regions B and D.
The N-terminal transit peptide sequence for targeting
TRAP to mitochondria, not present in HTPG proteins,
appears to have evolved at the base of the TRAP lineage.
TRAP genes only exist in Animalia and some Alveolata
and Englenozoa species in Protista, and appear to be
absent in others (Plantae, Fungi and some species in
Protista). The simplest way of explaining this pattern is for
TRAP proteins to have evolved in a basal Protista lineage,
which eventually gave rise to other Protista, to Animalia,
and to Fungi, and for these proteins to have subsequently
been lost in the Fungi lineage.
HSP90B subfamily of genes
Our data revealed that HSP90A+B+C is a monophyly with
high bootstrap support and 3 signature motifs (Table 4),
rooted also to Firmicutes HTPG genes but distant from
eukaryote TRAP genes. We suggest that eukaryote
HSP90A+B+C and TRAP originated from different Group
A HTPG ancestor copies present in the common ancestor
of Firmicutes and early eukaryotes. There are three main
theories to explain the origin of eukaryotes. According to
the archaeal hypothesis, a primitive amitochondriate
eukaryote originated from an archaeabacterium [43]. The
chimera hypothesis suggests that an amitochondriate cell
emerged as a fusion between an archaeabacterium and a
Gram-negative eubacterium, with their genomes having
mixed in some way [44,45]. Cavalier-Smith [36,37] suggested that the Eukaryota and Archaea, as sisters, evolved
from neomura, the suggested common ancestor that arose
from within Actinobacteria. Our results reject the archaeal
hypothesis due to the lack of a HSP90 homologue in
Archaea, and also the chimera hypothesis as Firmicutes is
a Gram-positive, not a Gram-negative bacteria. Because
Firmicutes and Actinobacteria are both Gram-positive
bacteria that share the closest HSP90 sequence to eukaryotic HSP90, our data support the neomura synthesis.
However, we have to assume that archaebacteria originally had a HSP90 homologue that was subsequently lost.
Our data show that all HSP90A+B+C and TRAP sequences
share 2 signature motifs (Table 4) that originated within
HTPG Group A. This suggests that HSP90A+B+C and
TRAP stem from a possible gene duplication event early in
the evolution of Group A, which is supported by a moderately high bootstrap. Both ancestral sequences were taken
into the nuclear genome of an eukaryotic cell when
eukaryotes originated. Firmicutes also has a Group C

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/156

HTPG copy, but we could not determine whether a Group
B HTPG copy also exists in this group of bacteria due to a
limitation of sequence data. We assume that any HTPG
copy other than those of Group A was not transferred into
the nuclear genome of the original eukaryote cell.
Gupta [23] suggested that HSP90A (the cytosolic copy)
and HSP90B (the copy that localizes to the ER) constitute
paralogous gene families that arose by a gene duplication
event that took place very early in the evolution of eukaryote cells. Only 22 HSP90A, 7 HSP90B and 1 HSP90C proteins sequences were involved in his phylogenetic study.
Subsequently, Emelyanov [24] and Stechmann & Cavalier-Smith [17,27] included 9 and 57 HSP90A, 2 and 9
HSP90B and 2 and 3 HSP90C sequences, respectively, in
their phylogenetic studies, and considered that HSP90B
and HSP90C (the copy that localizes to the chloroplast)
make a paraphyletic group, and sister group to HSP90A.
These analyses, however, did not include any protist
HSP90B sequences. Our sequence data (78 HSP90A, 31
HSP90B and 6 HSP90C) were selected from all sequences
currently available in the databases, and represents the
largest data set assembled for the gene family across the
broadest range of organisms. Importantly, our data set
contains 5 protist HSP90B sequences. In contrast to earlier
conclusions, our analysis revealed that HSP90B originated
earlier relative to HSP90C and HSP90A. The key-defining
characteristic of all eukaryotic cells is the presence of a
membrane-bounded nucleus. It is widely accepted that
the eubacterial partner developed numerous membrane
infolds in the formation of the eukaryote cell. The detachment of these membrane infolds from the symbiotic
eubacteria eventually led to the creation of the ER and
nuclear envelope [46]. The ER, a new compartment in the
cell, now required molecular chaperones to transmit
information within the compartment and to help transport "passenger proteins" across the membranes. Because
both of these functions have been associated with
HSP90B members [47], we propose that the ancestral
HTPG of the partner eubacteria evolved into HSP90B at
the very beginning of the eukaryote cell formation.
Subsequently, the genome of the eubacterial partner was
transferred to the newly formed nucleus, which led to the
creation of a new cell, the common ancestor of all eukaryotes. Subsequently, two gene duplication events took
place that led to HSP90C and HSP90A, respectively. The
nested origin of the HSP90A and HSP90C clades within
the HSP90B sequences, makes this latter group a paraphyletic group. HSP90B is the most diverse eukaryote
HSP90 subfamily, even lacking a unique signature motif.
Its genes are glucose-regulated and induced by glucose
starvation [1]. In addition, its proteins, once secreted to
the ER, are also known to participate in protein folding
and assembly, in protein secretion, in protecting cells

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:156

from undergoing apoptosis, and in mediating immunogenicity in tumor and virus-infected cells [1,48]. Structurally, they have an ER transit peptide, their Variable region
B is between HSP90A and HSP90C in length and their
Variable region D is the longest of all HSP90 subfamilies.
The highly conserved C-terminus sequence KDEL was
thought to facilitate HSP90B retention in the ER; however,
our data show that the motif is variable across organisms.
Interestingly, HSP90B was thought to be absent in Fungi
[17], but our genomic study detected a HSP90B copy in
the fungus Encephalitozoon cuniculi, but not in Cryptococcus
neoformans, Neurospora crassa and Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
which implies that the HSP90B has been lost in several
fungi lineages.
HSP90C subfamily of genes
HSP90C genes appear to be monophyletic, given the high
bootstrap support, and have 5 signature motifs. An earlier
study [30] made use of only four available HSP90C
sequences for Arabidopsis thaliana, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Oryza sativa and Secale cereale, respectively. All of
them contain a DPW motif at their C-termini, and we
named them HSP90C1. Surprisingly, our genomic study
revealed an additional copy from Arabidopsis thaliana and
Oryza sativa. The additional copies have high similarity to
HSP90C1 but lack the DPW motif, and we named them
HSP90C2. The Chlamydomonas reinhardtii genome only
has the HSP90C1 copy [30], which is quite distinct from
the HSP90C1 copy from higher plants. Our phylogeny
shows that the single HSP90C copy present in
Chlamydomonas duplicated into the HSP90C1 and
HSP90C2 copies of higher plants, both clades supported
with high bootstrap values. Due to the limitation of the
sequences available, the signature sequences of HSP90C
members and the exact origin of the subsequent gene
duplication event need to be further addressed. HSP90C1
proteins are localized only in the chloroplast [49-51]. This
organelle is universally accepted to have monophyletically arisen from within cyanobacteria [52-54]. The phylogeny of HSP60 and HSP70 also supported this synthesis
[24]. In agreement with Emelyanov [24] and Stechmann
& Cavalier-Smith [17], our data support the origin of chloroplast HSP90C from ER HSP90B and from Protista
ancestors, not from plant HSP90B. This new HSP90C
copy later acquired a chloroplast transit peptide. As in
mitochondrial TRAP, the restricted presence of HSP90C
genes, in this case only in plants and in some species of
protista, implies that either HSP90C genes appeared in a
lineage of protista that gave rise to plants or that they
evolved earlier but have been lost in other lineages
through unknown evolutionary pressures. Our low bootstrap values at the base of the HSP90C clade do not allow
us to distinguish between these alternative explanations.
HSP90C1 proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana and
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii are constitutively expressed but

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/156

they are also light and heat-shock inducible. They exhibit
weak ATPase activity that can be inhibited by the HSP90specific inhibitor radicicol, and possibly function in stress
management and in the maturation of specific client protein, e.g. components of signal transduction pathways
[50,51]. This is the first time that HSP90C2 genes have
been reported, and their expression and function await to
be addressed. Based on the high sequence similarity with
HSP90C1, HSP90C2 proteins are possibly also working in
the chloroplast but we cannot exclude the possibility that
they are localized to other cell compartments
HSP90A subfamily of genes
Our study indicates that HSP90A is also a monophyletic
with high bootstrap support and 11 signature motifs. This
is consistent with earlier studies in which all HSP90A
sequences were clustered into a single clade
[17,23,24,27]. In vertebrates HSP90A was divided into
two classes HSP90AA and HSP90AB, with 7 and 1 signature sequences, respectively. However, the difference
between these two classes was markedly smaller than the
difference among HSP90A sequences across animals,
fungi, plant and protists. An additional gene duplications
event is required to explain the presence of HSP90AA and
HSP90AB, which took place early in the origin of vertebrates. Structurally, HSP90A lacks the signal peptide in its
N-terminus and its Variable region B is the longest of all
subfamilies. HSP90A proteins are largely cytosolic [1],
have ATPase activity, and are involved in the folding of
cell regulatory proteins and the re-folding of stress-denatured polypeptides [33]. HSP90AA is somewhat inducible, whereas HSP90AB1 is more constitutively expressed
[1].
Organismal evolution
The unicellular protists are universally accepted to be the
original sources of eukaryote diversity. Based primarily on
their morphology and biology, protists can be assigned to
several dozen well-characterized groups [55]. Each of the
other eukaryote kingdoms (Animalia, Fungi, Plantae) can
be directly traced back to a corresponding protist origin
[37,38,56]. This explains why protist sequences are at the
base of the various organismal branches within our
HSP90A clade.

Many attempts have been made to establish a natural,
phylogenetic system of eukaryotes, but the relationships
and the order of evolutionary emergence of many diverse
groups remain unresolved, primarily because of the lack
of clear synapomorphies [57]. Our phylogeny of HSP90A
among Animalia, Fungi, Plantae and Protista do not seem
completely consistent with the current view of eukaryote
evolution that postulates that Animalia has a closer relationship to Fungi than to Plantae [36,37,56]. This contradiction with respect to the branching order was not

supported by strong bootstrap values and was probably
brought about by the limited number of genomes analyzed within the eukaryotes. Phylogenies of other genes,
including HSP70, GRP78 and 16S rRNA [44,58], and 22
protein-coding genes [57] place Diplomonadida (containing Giardia lamblia) and Parabasala at the base of the
Eukaryota. Our phylogeny of the HSP90A clade also
clearly demonstrates that Giardia lamblia is basal to all
eukaryotes, followed by Trichomonas vaginalis in Parabasala.

Conclusion
The present study presents the first comparative genomic
study and evolutionary analysis of the HSP90 family of
genes across all kingdoms of organisms. HSP90 family
members underwent multiple duplications and also subsequent losses during their evolution. Based on the phylogeny of their proteins and the cell compartments the
proteins function in, we divided the gene family into 5
subfamilies, HSP90A, HSP90B, HSP90C, TRAP, and
HTPG, and established a new nomenclature system. This
system has not been used for other gene families, and it
may serve as a model for the nomenclature of other chaperone gene families (e.g. HSP100, HSP70, HSP60, and
small HSP) that have a similar status to the HSP90 gene
family. This study established an overall framework of
information for the family of HSP90 genes, which may
facilitate and stimulate the study of this gene family across
all organisms.

Methods
Sequence retrieving and genome screening
In order to find all putative HSP90 family members we
performed PSI-BLAST [59] searches of the protein database throughout all organisms at NCBI [60] using Homo
sapiens protein sequences HSP90AA1 (NP_005339.2;
[28]),
HSP90AB1
(NP_031381.2),
HSP90B1
(NP_003290.1), TRAP1 (NP_057376.1), Arabidopsis thaliana HSP90C1 (AAD32922.1), and Escherichia coli HTPG
(AAA23460.1) as queries, respectively. Each search
resulted in a list of similar sequences, which was added to
the next round of PSI-BLAST iteration searches, and each
search continued until no new sequence with an alignment score above the default threshold was retrieved. The
sequences returned by these queries were combined and
all redundant sequences were discarded. All sequences
were examined individually and aligned using Clustal X
[61]. Any sequence with sequence identity lower than a
predefined threshold for assigning homology [62] was
excluded from the study. Only complete and representative protein sequences were employed for subsequent evolutionary study, but remaining sequences were also used
for the comparative analysis of sequence conservation.
Sequence identity and similarity were calculated using
BioEdit v5.0 [63].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/156

Thirty-two species of nuclear genomes were investigated
belonging to Archaea (1 species), Bacteria (10), Fungi (4),
Protista (4), Plantae (3) and Animalia (10) (Table 1, Table
2). To localize the members of the HSP90 gene family
within each genome, we used MapViewer at NCBI. A
TBLASTN search against each genome assembly was
applied using each of the protein query sequences mentioned above, whereas a BLASTN search was performed
with the nucleotide query sequences. Subsequently, a 200
kb genome sequence flanking each hit, or close hits, was
downloaded from the corresponding strand of the chromosome. The GENSCAN software [64] was used to identify the genes in each 200kb sequence. In order to reduce
prediction error in genome research, we filtered out predictions of gene sequences with an exon probability less
than 50% in the GENSCAN calculation, and/or with a
coding region (CDS) shorter than 200 bp. DNA and protein sequences of the predicted genes were separately
aligned with the sequences of the six queries mentioned
above, to remove genes other than those in the HSP90
family using the same threshold for assigning homology
[62]. All mRNA sequences retrieved from the databases,
and coding sequences predicted from each species, were
run on MapViewer to obtain their chromosomal locations
according to corresponding Map Elements from the
search results. All different mRNA sequences and predicted coding sequences that mapped to the same chromosomal site were considered sources from a single gene,
and a single mRNA or predicted coding sequence most
closely matching the genomic and query sequences was
selected to represent the gene. The nucleotide starting and
ending locations of introns and exons of the selected transcript were recorded in order to identify total exon numbers.
Protein sequence properties
The signal peptide was predicted using both neural network (NN) and hidden markov model (HMM) methods
with the program SignalP v3.0 [65,67]. The size of the
mature proteins was estimated as the size of precursors
after removal of the predicted signal peptide. The molecular mass of the precursor and mature protein was calculated using BioEdit. In order to identify biologically
significant motifs and domains for each divergent protein
sequence we used two different software programs. ScanProsite software [66] was used to search against the
PROSITE database of protein families and domains
(Release 18.40 of 22-Nov-2004) [68], whereas InterProScan [69] was used against InterPro, a database of protein
domains and functional sites [70]. In the genome study,
pseudogenes were determined by the absence of both the
transcript and the functional domain in the predicted
sequence. In order to characterize the HSP90 family of
proteins and its subdivided classes, the amino acid residues completely conserved throughout the family and in

each subfamily, and the conserved/variable regions, were
identified by BioEdit based on the alignments produced
by Clustal X.
Phylogenetic analysis
The phylogenetic analysis was performed on a.a.
sequences using maximum parsimony with PAUP*
v4.0b8 [71]. We performed a heuristic search employing
step-wise addition with 1000 random taxon addition
sequence replicates and best trees held at each step.
Branches were collapsed if maximum branch length was
zero. All characters were given equal weight and gaps were
treated as "missing". The node support was assessed using
5000 bootstrap pseudo-replicates with step-wise addition
and parsimony criteria.

Abbreviations
a.a., amino acid; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HTPG, high
temperature protein G; HSP90, 90 kDa heat-shock protein; TRAP, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein.
