Abstract
DNA was extracted from lamb lymphocytes that were infected in vivo with a BLV strain after
inoculation with the peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a persistently sero-indeterminate,
low viral load, BLV-infected Holstein cow (No. 41) from Argentina. The DNA was PCR amplified
with a series of overlapping primers encompassing the entire BLV proviral DNA. The amplified BLV
ARG 41 DNA was cloned, sequenced, and compared phylogenetically to other BLV sequences
including an in vivo high replicating strain (BLV ARG 38) from the same herd in Argentina.
Characterization of BLV ARG 41's deduced proteins and its relationship to other members of the
PTLV/BLV genus of retroviruses are discussed.

Background
Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) is an infectious agent of cattle that can cause B-lymphocytic lymphoma/leukemia
and benign disorders that, directly or indirectly, have a
financial impact on the cattle industry [1-3]. It is estimated that more than 10 and 30% of the dairy and beef
cattle in the United States and Argentina, respectively, are
infected with BLV [1,2,4]. BLV, together with the primate
T-cell leukemia lymphoma viruses (PTLV), form a separate genus of retroviruses that exhibit in vivo lymphotropism and are characterized by the transforming property
of a unique virus regulatory protein, Tax, that can transactivate both viral and cellular genes [[5] and [6]]. A sizeable

minority (5–20%) of cattle or primates infected with BLV
or PTLV, respectively, either take a long time (>2 years) or
never fully seroconvert [7-9]. Detection of infection in
seronegative or seroindeterminate hosts requires PCR
analyses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)
for viral DNA; such analyses usually indicate a relatively
low viral DNA copy number compared to high titer seropositive subjects [10]. RNA-PCR assays for viral RNA in
the plasma and/or PBMC from such low DNA copy subjects are negative, while high titer seropositives have copy
numbers ranging from 0 to 10,000 copies per ml [5]. The
reason(s) for these differences in seroconversion and
peripheral blood viral loads among BLV and PTLV

infected hosts are unknown, but certainly could be due in
part to genetic differences among viral strains. Previously,
we published the full length sequence of BLV ARG 38, a
viral strain obtained from a high titer seropositive, high
viral load Holstein cow from a commercial herd of dairy
cattle maintained near the Facultad de Ciencias Veterinarieas de Tandil, Argentina (FCV-UNCP-BA) [11]. Herein,
we describe the sequence of BLV Arg 41, a BLV isolate
obtained from another cow from that same herd that was
persistently seroindeterminate and had persistently low
BLV viral DNA loads.

Results
BLV Arg 41 isolation
Cows 38 and 41 were members of a Holstein dairy herd in
TandilBalcarce, Argentina that was routinely monitored
over a many year period for BLV infection using serologic
assays for anti BLV antibodies and PCR assays of PBMC
for BLV DNA. Both cows remained clinically healthy over
eight years of observation, but cow 38 had a persistent
lymphocytosis (PL). Cow 38 was found to have a high
viral load (>10,000 copies of BLV pol DNA per μg of
PBMC DNA) and rapidly (<3 months) seroconverted with
high titer (range 200 to 800) of antibodies to both BLV
p24 gag (titer ~200) and gp51 env (titer ~800) proteins.
These high viral DNA loads and high titers of anti-BLV
antibodies persisted over 8 years of observation. The complete genomic sequence of the BLV strain infecting cow 38
(BLV ARG-38) has been previously published [11].

When first sampled in October 1995, cow 41 had been
low titer (50–100) antibodies to gp51, no antibodies to
p24, and was also PCR negative for BLV. In March, 1996,
it developed low titer antibodies to BLV p24 (10). Since
then, it has had persistent low titer antibodies to gp51 but
has remained seronegative to p24 and, hence, would be
deemed to have indeterminate seroreactivity to BLV antigens. It was first found to be PCR positive for BLV DNA in
October, 1996, with a viral load of 160 copies of BLV DNA
per μg of PBMC DNA. Since then, it has been persistently
PCR positive, but with viral loads ranging from 5 to 10
copies of BLV DNA per μg of PBMC DNA. The viral strain
infecting cow 41 is referred to as BLV ARG 41.
Because the initial copy number of BLV ARG 41 in PBMC
was so low, the cloning and sequencing of PCR amplified
BLV DNA proved to be difficult. Hence, we attempted to
isolate the BLV ARG 41 strain by inoculating a lamb with
130 ml of heparinized blood from cow 41. This lamb
(p12) rapidly seroconverted (<3 months) with persistent
high titer antibody to both BLV p24 gag and gp51 env
antigens. The BLV DNA copy number in p12 PBMC has
been persistently >5,000 copies per μg of cellular DNA.
Using DNA from post infection p12 PBMC, PCR amplification and Southern blot hybridization were successful

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/120

for each of the BLV primer pair/probe groups utilized. The
complete sequence of BLV ARG 41 was obtained from
these amplified products (Gen Bank Accession No.
FJ914764). No variability was observed among the many
overlapping clones sequenced from each of the regions
amplified, indicating that the p12 cells were infected with
one unique strain of BLV.
Comparative analyses indicate that BLV ARG 41 is approximately 98.9% homologous to BLV ARG 38, 95.6%
homologous to BLV A from Australia, 96.4% homologous
to BLV GAGA from Belgium, and 96.4% homologous to
BLV CG from Japan. Phylogenetic analyses (Fig 1) confirm that BLV ARG 41 and BLV ARG 38 are most homologous to each other.
Comparison of the LTR of BLV ARG 41 with that of the
other full-length BLV sequences is shown in Fig. 2. It contains the RNA transcription promoter and enhancer elements, NF-KB binding site between the second and third
enhancers, cyclic AMP response elements (CRE) and E
box motifs within the enhancers, glucocorticoid response
element 5' to the third enhancer, PU box, interferon regulatory factor binding site, polyadenylation signal, REX
response element and the tRNA proline primer binding
site typical of BLV. BLV ARG 38 and BLV ARG 41 have
identical sequences in these functional regions except for
the sequences in the CRE contained in the first enhancer
element (AGACGTCA for BLV Arg 41 and AAACGTCA for
BLV Arg 38). It is unknown what effect this change might
have on viral transcription. However, other experimental
changes in the BLV CRE have been shown to alter transcriptional activity [12]. The only other small differences
between the two sequences occur in regions of the LTR
that are not believed to be of functional significance. Both
strains have the same number and location of CpG methylation sites. Hence, there is only one difference in the
LTRs of BLV ARG 38 and BLV ARG 41 that could explain
the in vivo differences in serologic reactivity and viral load
observed in their respective bovine hosts.
While the BLV gag region is highly conserved, it is apparent (Fig. 3) that there are two different peptide sequences
preferred for p15 and p24. However, there are only minor
differences between BLV ARG 38 and BLV ARG 41. One
potentially functional difference could be the amino acid
change P140S (position 249 in GAG in Fig 3) in the BLV
Arg 41 p24 gag protein. This change lies in the major
homology region of all retroviruses and, wherein, other
mutations have been shown to affect BLV infectivity [13].
There were no differences in the two p24 epitopes responsible for anti-BLV T-cell recognition in BLV infected animals [14]. The BLV CG strain is markedly divergent over
the last 40 amino acids of its p24 protein. Whether this is
a real observation or the result of sequencing error (Fig. 4)
and whether these changes would have functional consePage 2 of 11

quences are unknown. However, because this is a highly
conserved, immunodominant region in the BLV/PTLV
genus, it seems likely that such a change would have significant biological consequences [[15] and [16]].
The deduced protease proteins among the five BLV strains
(Fig. 3) were also highly conserved, except for the fact that
the published sequence of BLV GAGA contains an insertion that causes a frame shift at amino acid (aa) 150 and
eliminates a stop codon at aa 169 (Fig. 3 &4). Again, it is
highly likely that this difference may be due to a sequencing error in BLV GAGA. While BLV ARG 38 has four

unique aa changes relative to all the other four BLV
strains, BLV ARG 41 has one. It is unknown whether these
changes could affect protease function.
The deduced RNase, reverse transcriptase, and integrase
amino acids encoded by the pol gene of all five BLV strains
are highly conserved (Fig. 3 and 4), with there being two
slightly different peptide sequences among the five
strains. There are nine unique amino acids in the RNase/
RT of BLV ARG 38 relative to all of the other BLV strains,
including BLV ARG41. There are no differences between
the integrases of BLV ARG 38 and BLV ARG 41.

proteins of all five strains are also highly conserved, as are
the gp51 surface env proteins of four of the strains (Fig. 4).
BLV ARG 38, however, demonstrates significant divergence at the carboxyl terminus of its gp51 env protein.
This is the transmembrane hydrophobic region of gp51,

believed to be responsible for anchoring the surface env
protein in the viral membrane [17]. Hydrophobicity plots
(data not shown) indicate that this region of BLV ARG 38
would be more hydrophobic than BLV ARG 41 and the
other three strains and, theoretically, more stably embedded in the viral envelope.

Save for minor differences, all N-linked glycosylation sites
and neutralizing domains in both env proteins are conserved. The following important functional domains are
also identical: the putative cell surface receptor binding
sites and neutralizing domains on the surface gp51 env
protein; the peptide region in gp51 that induces a CD8+
cytotoxic T-cell response in the host cow; the highly
immunogenic epitope GD21 that is conserved in all members of the PTLV/BLV genus; the tetrapeptide WAPE (aa
222–225 in Fig. 4) that has been shown to be critical for
infection; and the amino acids P and D (aa 210 and 211
in Fig. 4) that have been shown to induce T-helper proliferative responses in cattle [15-17]. There is one unique
mutation, E161G, in the CD8+ T-cell response epitope of
the gp51 env of BLV ARG 41 that theoretically could alter
the stimulation of the anti-BLV CD8+ T-cell response [6].
Comparison of the five deduced BLV Tax and Rex proteins
again demonstrates what is probably the result of
sequencing errors in BLVA (Fig. 4, 5, and 6). With that
noted, there are two different peptide sequences evident
in aa 78–84 of the Tax protein, with BLV ARG 41 being
different from BLV ARG 38. Because this area has been
shown to be critical for Tax transactivation, these differences could result in variable viral replication and/or host
cell transformation [18]. All told, there are 13 different aa
in the BLV ARG 41 vs BLV ARG 38 Tax proteins. There are
five aa differences between the BLV ARG 41 and BLV ARG
38 Rex proteins.
The deduced amino acids from two peptides, GIV and RIII
ORF, which are translated from alternatively spliced
mRNA's known to be expressed in BLV-infected cells, are
also shown in Fig. 5. The expression of GIV, has been associated with PL in infected cattle [19]. Cow 38 exhibits PL
and its GIV protein is quite divergent from BLV Gaga, BLV
A, and BLV Cg; however, it is identical to the BLV ARG 41
sequence and cow 41 did not exhibit PL.

Discussion
BLV is a member of a genus of retroviruses that cause a
variety of malignant and autoimmune diseases in cattle,
humans, and nonhuman primates. While much is known
regarding the clinical sequelae of BLV infection in domesticated cattle, little is known of its genetic diversity, epidemiology, and disease association among bovids around
the planet. Because the human retroviruses, HTLV-1, 2, 3,
and 4 share a common ancestor with BLV, understanding
this genetic diversity and its biological implications is of
interest to human as well as veterinary medicine.
Continued epidemiological studies indicate that there are
two distinct chronic infection states among BLV infected
cattle [10]. One, characterized by a high viral DNA load
and antiviral antibody titer, is associated with a higher fre-

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/120

quency of peripheral blood lymphocytosis and B-lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma. The other is characterized
by a low viral DNA load, lower antibody titers and a more
favorable clinical prognosis.
There are several possible explanations for the differences
in the infection profiles observed among BLV infected cattle. These include biologic differences among strains of
BLV and/or among the bovine hosts. Recently, we have
published data regarding the correlation of various BoLA
genotypes found in cattle with the development of either
the high viral load or low viral load infectious profiles
[[20,21], Juliarena M.A., Ceriani C., Dube S., Poli M.,
Gutierrez S., Dolcini G., Sala L., Poiesz B., and Esteban E.]
Further characterization of the bovine leukemia virus
(BLV) infection profile named low proviral load (LPL),
submitted). These data suggest that genetic differences
among cattle influence the replication of BLV among
infected hosts and the development of leukemia/lymphoma.
The publication of full length BLV sequences from both a
high [11] and a low (this study) proviral load infected cow
should allow for future comparisons of BLV infected cattle
to ascertain whether differences in viral strains could also
explain the observed infectivity patterns. These comparisons should also elucidate the biologic importance of
genetic differences observed in functional or structural
regions of the BLV genome.

Materials and methods
Cow 41
PBMC were obtained from a Holstein (Holando-Argentino) dairy cow (No. 41). Cow 41 had been proven to be
infected with BLV by PCR serology assays, including ELISA
and Western blot assays for antibodies to BLV p24 and
gp51 env proteins, as previously described [9,10,22]. Cow
41 remains in good health and never developed PL. It's
antibody titers against the above BLV antigens and it's BLV
proviral load were monitored episodically over eight
years. One hundred thirty ml of peripheral blood from
cow 41 were used to subcutaneously inoculate a lamb
(p12), which was monitored for BLV infection, as above.
This lamb became infected with the BLV Arg 41 strain.
Nucleic Acid and Amino Acid Studies
DNA was organically extracted from either cow 41 or
lamb p12 PBMC and amplified via PCR using overlapping
primer pairs that encompass the entire BLV genome, as
previously described [11]. The amplified products were
detected by Southern blot hybridization using 32P-labeled
oligonucleotide probes located between the flanking
primers. Amplified specific products were cloned into a
TA cloning vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), and
sequenced using an automated sequencer (Applied Bio-
