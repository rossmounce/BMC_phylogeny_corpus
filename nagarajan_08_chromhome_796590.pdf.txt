Abstract
Background: Comparative genomics has become a significant research area in recent years,
following the availability of a number of sequenced genomes. The comparison of genomes is of
great importance in the analysis of functionally important genome regions. It can also be used to
understand the phylogenetic relationships of species and the mechanisms leading to rearrangement
of karyotypes during evolution. Many species have been studied at the cytogenetic level by cross
species chromosome painting. With the large amount of such information, it has become vital to
computerize the data and make them accessible worldwide. Chromhome http://
www.chromhome.org is a comprehensive web application that is designed to provide cytogenetic
comparisons among species and to fulfil this need.
Results: The Chromhome application architecture is multi-tiered with an interactive client layer,
business logic and database layers. Enterprise java platform with open source framework
OpenLaszlo is used to implement the Rich Internet Chromhome Application. Cross species
comparative mapping raw data are collected and the processed information is stored into MySQL
Chromhome database. Chromhome Release 1.0 contains 109 homology maps from 51 species. The
data cover species from 14 orders and 30 families. The homology map displays all the
chromosomes of the compared species as one image, making comparisons among species easier.
Inferred data also provides maps of homologous regions that could serve as a guideline for
researchers involved in phylogenetic or evolution based studies.
Conclusion: Chromhome provides a useful resource for comparative genomics, holding graphical
homology maps of a wide range of species. It brings together cytogenetic data of many genomes
under one roof. Inferred painting can often determine the chromosomal homologous regions
between two species, if each has been compared with a common third species. Inferred painting
greatly reduces the need to map entire genomes and helps focus only on relevant regions of the
chromosomes of the species under study. Future releases of Chromhome will accommodate more
species and their respective gene and BAC maps, in addition to chromosome painting data.
Chromhome application provides a single-page interface (SPI) with desktop style layout, delivering
a better and richer user experience.

Background
Comparisons between species genomes are based on
maps, which vary in resolution from gene rich maps of
human or mouse to gene poor maps of other mammalian
species. Numerous online resources are available for comparing sequenced genomes. Ensembl [1], NCBI [2] and
Human Genome Browser [3] are large databases holding
genomic as well as comparative sequence information for
mammalian species. Mouse Genome Database, Rat
Genome Database, Flybase and Wormbase are species
specific databases. Bioinformatics tools like PipMaker [4],
VISTA [5], BLAST and CLUSTAL-W offer local and global
alignments of two or more genomic sequences. These
resources make comparisons and predictions of phylogenetic relationships easy and accurate for sequenced species.
From the evolutionary point of view, representative species of all families and orders are important, as they can
provide insights into phylogenetic relationships. Sequencing these genomes would be a considerable task for biologists. It is therefore essential to have basic first hand
information about species genomes through simpler and
faster methodologies. Comparative chromosome painting can be used here, as a guide to the construction of simple maps in unmapped species or as a useful tool for
studying karyotype evolution. When chromosome specific paint probes from one species (probe species) are
hybridised to the chromosome preparations from another
species (target species), homologous regions conserved
between the two species are detected [6] The resolution is
estimated to be approximately between 2 Mb to 3 Mb.
Reciprocal cross-species painting helps to determine the
genetic content and position of the homologous regions
of one species on the other. This information is valuable
in identifying ancient syntenies shared by widely divergent species and in indicating the likely structure of ancestral chromosomes. When large blocks of homology are
associated with one another in all species of a particular
taxonomy they are regarded as being shared ancestral
characters. Other syntenies can be considered as common
derived characters because they have arisen in a known
common ancestor and are thus of more recent origin.
Human chromosome paint probes have provided the evidence for the conservation of such syntenies across mammalian orders and for the construction of presumptive
ancestral karyotypes [6]. Chromosome homology maps
can also be used to aid comparative gene mapping. The
location of EST or genes of interest in an unmapped species is most likely to be found within the region that
shares homology with the human segment that contains
the orthologous sequence.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/168

With the great volume of cross-species painting data, there
is a need for a flexible, scalable, readily available, and
user-friendly software application for storing and comparing the chromosome information of various species.
CHROMHOME (Chromosome Homology Mapping and
Electronic-painting) is a comprehensive web application
that is designed to provide cytogenetic comparisons
among species using chromosome painting.

Implementation
Data Collection
Various research groups from around the world have generated cross species painting data from representative species of all mammalian orders [7-15]. Cross species
chromosome painting data is available for over 100 species from different families of mammals, birds and reptiles (Figure 1), and can be obtained through Pubmed
searches. For species that do not have sequence data available in online databases, the only sources for initial
cytogenetic data acquisition are publications. Although a
wide range of literature exists, for each species the entire
cytogenetic data may not appear in the same publication.
The painting data, the reverse painting and the idiograms
may occur in different papers. Furthermore, data published by different authors for the same species may differ
in their results, which may be due to use of different chromosome nomenclatures. The data from various sources
need to be analyzed, reconciled, grouped, processed and
made readily accessible.

The data comes in different levels of detail ranging from
karyotype to homology maps. G-banding (a technique of
staining partially denatured chromosomes with Giemsa
stains) forms a pattern of dark and light bands, which enables unequivocal recognition of specific chromosomes.
An idiogram is a graphical representation of a G-banded
karyotype. Species like human or mouse have G-banded
idiograms and related sequence information that can be
obtained from Ensembl. But most other species have only
G-banded karyotypes. The Atlas of Mammalian Chromosomes [16] holds karyotype data for 815 species of which
43 have idiograms that are used in Chromhome.
Data Storage and Processing
Chromhome uses a Relational Database Management
System (RDBMS), as it offers structured storage and maintains data integrity. The database of choice for Chromhome is MySQL [17]. Retrieval of information from the
database is through a series of SQL scripts and the resultset can be exported easily in text formats. This database
forms the central repository for overall Chromhome data
organization giving the added benefits of concurrency,
scalability and transaction supports. The techniques to
integrate the database to feed web applications use JDBC
(Java Data Base Connectivity) protocols and related java

architecture forms the n-tier enterprise model (Figure 2)
with an interactive client layer, presentation layer, business logic layer and the data layer. The Java Enterprise Edition (JEE) is the underlying technology stack. A number of
industry-standard open source solutions are employed to
build Chromhome.
OpenLaszlo [21] Rich Internet Application (RIA) platform
is used for the development and deployment of the web
pages. The presentation pages of Chromhome are written
with OpenLaszlo's markup language LZX (Laszlo XML).
These are saved on the server side and invoked by clients
in the runtime. The server component is deployed as a
J2EE web application (a servlet) that intercepts the script

data, Ensembl for karyotype information for sequenced species and specific species genome databases such as Mouse
Genome Database or Rat Genome Database.

APIs (Application Programming Interface) wrapped in
OR/M (Object Relational Mapping) implementations.
To convert the pictorial data to numerical genome based
data for Chromhome, the total genome size in basepairs
is used to calculate the approximate size of each chromosome in a species. In the Animal Genome Size Database,
Release 2.0 [18] the genome size, or the C-value, for 4379
species is published. The C-value is expressed in picograms and can be converted to the number of nucleotides
in the genome by an established formula [19]. For species
with no genome size information, the genome size of a
closely related species or species from the same family is
considered. Based on the measurements of the lengths of
chromosomes and size of chromosome homologous
regions, an idiogram and homology maps are created for
each species. The data are presented as G-banded karyotypes or idiograms for the species. In the homology maps,
probe chromosomes are depicted as blocks on chromosomes of the target species to show homologies between
them.
Chromhome Architecture
Software system architecting consists of deciding what
tiers are needed for the application and what services are
required at each tier. The Chromhome application is
designed and architected in accordance with separation of
concerns and design-by-contract (DBC) principles of software best practices [20]. Accordingly, the application

is the web browser layer through which the user selects the
target, probe and method species combination and sends a
http request. The request goes through the middle tier that
connects to the database layer through JDBC (Java Database
Connectivity) and retrieves the information from the database. The data is processed in the middle tier through a
series of programs and is sent back to the web browser,
where the client can view the homology maps.

requests from the client, interprets them, and serves them
as Flash runtime binaries. Apache Jakarta Tomcat [22] is
used as the web server for Chromhome application. Tomcat along with OpenLaszlo provide the presentation tier.
Hibernate [23] Object-Relational Mapping (O/RM) tool is
used to develop persistent classes for Chromhome following Java idioms like association and composition. All the
Chromhome domain classes are implemented as POJOs
(Plain Old Java Object). The instance variables in the class
are mapped with the columns in the table. Combining
Spring Framework [24] with Hibernate greatly reduces the
amount of plumbing code. Chromhome uses Spring DAO
(Data Access Object) support for Hibernate. Spring and
Hibernate frameworks support the business logic tier of
Chromhome application.
The whole project is tailored to follow Rational Unified
Process (RUP) with use case driven, architectural-centric
and iterative ingredients. During the initiation phase of
the project, the important use cases were identified and
the event flows were documented. Use case realizations
were achieved through sequence diagrams. UML (Unified
Modelling Language) [25] modelling is done through the
Enterprise Architecture [20] design tool. The Database
Model describes the data which must be stored and
retrieved as part of the overall Chromhome design. This
describes the tables and data in detail and enables generation of DDL (Data Definition Language) scripts to create
and setup databases. Chromhome Data Model diagram
(Figure 3) represents the schema with entity-relationship
multiplicity.

and probe species and the method to get the chromosome
maps. The view on the right presents the resulting homology maps and species information (Figure 6).

The main sequence diagram of Chromhome is shown in
Figure 4. The initial user request is handled by the java
class, ChManager. ChManager serves as a faÃ§ade class for
the application. It communicates with the business object
class ChBO, to fetch the requested data. Business object
class wraps all the application logic and through the data
utility class, PersistenceUtil, it organizes the data retrieval.
Species, FeatureType, Homology and FeatureAnalysis are
some of the domain classes that are mapped to database
tables. MapManager component handles the idiogram
and homology map generation. MapManager gets the
data in XML format and makes use of Ensembl draw code.
Eclipse platform [26] with MyEclipse [27] Java EE IDE
(Integrated Development Environment) is used to code,
debug and unit test the application

window. The catalogue menu shows the available homology maps in Chromhome, in a matrix format.

The selection view on the left presents two sets of species
on two separate tabbed views. The target is the species on
whose chromosomes the probe species chromosomes are
hybridized to obtain the chromosome homology maps.
Selecting the target species through a mouse click brings
up another tab view presenting a set of probe species that
has homology data with the selected target species. Further selection of probe species presents another tab view
of methods available for the given target-probe combination. When the user selects a method, the homology map
is displayed on the right, for that unique target-probemethod combination. In the homology map, the probe
species chromosomes are marked along the sides of the
target species chromosomes. Each probe chromosome is
assigned a specific colour for ease of identification and
possible pattern recognition within the homology map.
There are menu options to print homology maps and idiograms. The references for target, probe and homology
data are available in the reference menu. PubMed ids to
the references are provided and displayed on the reference

Inferred painting may help researchers in finding significant information about species where no direct cross-species chromosome painting exists. If species A and species
B are mapped on species N, then it is possible to deduce
some of the chromosomal arrangements of A on B or B on
A with respect to the arrangements of N chromosomes.
Many of the species in Chromhome have been mapped
on human chromosomes using chromosome painting. It
is therefore possible to infer homologies between two species each of which have been hybridized with human
probes. In certain cases, inferred homologies result in
ambiguities, which are indicated in Chromhome by multiple numbers next to the chromosomes and any one colour pertaining to the probe chromosome is displayed. For
instance, ambiguity arises when a chromosome region is
conserved between species A and N, but in species B this
region is divided in two or more sub regions. An example
of the use of a selective gene map of pig to resolve ambiguities in the pig and cow inferred map is seen in Chromhome. A more lengthy discussion on the cause of these
ambiguities is beyond the scope of this report and is given
elsewhere [Nagarajan et al, in preparation]. Of the 51 species in Chromhome, 22 species have gene/EST/BAC maps
available either in genome databases such as Ensembl [1],
NCBI [2], and ENCODE [28] or in scientific publications.
These maps may be used with homology maps to improve
inferred painting results. Chromhome provides inferred
paintings for 10 species that do not have chromosome
painting data.
In the current release, only chromosome painting by FISH
and inferred painting methods are available. Future
releases of Chromhome will accommodate gene, BAC and
other mapping methods. Features like comparison to
ancestral karyotype for each species will also be added. We
are working on data and formatting standards to help
users to upload their own data and generate homologies.
Once the data are published they can be included in
Chromhome.

Chromhome is a rich internet application presenting
comparative chromosome homology data for a diverse
range of species. Inferred data adds to the value of the
application, where one can compare any two species that
have been painted with a common third species. This may
help researchers to focus on those chromosomes of interest for further analysis. The availability of a number of
homology maps for different species on Chromhome provides input for evolutionary analysis and for the prediction of ancestral chromosomes and points us in the
