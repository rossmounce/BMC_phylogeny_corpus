Abstract
Background: Several types of selective forces can act to promote parasite specialization. Parasites
might specialize on some suitable hosts at the cost of decreasing effectiveness when exploiting
other species of hosts, and specialization can be more easily selected for in hosts that the parasites
will easily find. Thus demographic characteristics of suitable hosts such as population density and
its spatial consistency could be key factors predicting probability of parasite specialization and
speciation. Here, we explore this hypothesis by studying the relationship between occurence of
specialized races of the European cuckoo (Cuculus canorus) (i.e. gentes) and mean and coefficient of
variation in population density estimated for 12 different European regions.
Results: The results were in accordance with the hypothesis because specialized cuckoo egg
morphs were more common in suitable hosts with high population density and low variation in
population density at the level of host species or genera.
Conclusion: We have presented evidence suggesting that population density and homogeneity of
geographic distribution of hosts explain, at least partly, the evolution of specialized egg-morphs of
the European cuckoo. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that resource (i.e., host)
predictability explains the evolution of host races and species of parasites.

Background
The study of evolutionary processes of host specialization
by parasites is of special importance for evolutionary biologists because it causes speciation events in parasites, and,
therefore, it is one of the main examples of ecological conditions driving adaptive radiation of parasitic groups on
their hosts [1,2]. In general, among suitable hosts, the
degree of host specificity of parasites can be seen as an
equilibrium between two opposing evolutionary forces
that describe the trade-off in the ability to optimally parasitize different hosts: (1) to use the maximum number of

hosts encountered; and (2) to make best use of the most
frequently encountered hosts [3]. However, as the
number of potential host species increases, the probability that a specialist parasite can locate a suitable host
decreases, reducing the advantages gained through specialization. In these cases, generalist parasites would experience greater fitness advantages and specialization would
no longer be adaptive [4]. Thus, when trade-offs for
exploiting different hosts exist, relative host abundance is
the key to host specificity [3]. Given sufficient abundance
of target host, the benefits of specialization, which

increase the parasite's efficiency in acquiring resources
from the most abundant host, outweigh the disadvantages
of interacting less well with other non-specific potential
hosts [4]. On the other hand, generalist parasites would
thrive in heterogeneous communities, as it allows a parasite to reproduce successfully in many of the encountered
potential hosts. In other words, predictability of resources
(i.e., hosts availability) would be a key factor explaining
probability of host specialization [5]. If host populations
are unpredictable and ephemeral, generalist parasites are
more likely to occur [6].
Demographic parameters of both host and parasites
including host abundance and distribution at a large geographic scale (i.e. metapopulation level) are known to be
key factors explaining host-specialization by parasites [7].
Many parasites show common patterns of host specificity,
with higher host specificity where host abundance is high
and reliable [3,7]. In accordance with this pattern, in several unrelated parasitic taxa, greater host specificity has
been detected in temperate, but not in tropical, regions
where the community of potential hosts is less diverse and
species are more abundant [see examples in [3]]. In addition, in a study involving five trophic levels (plant, phytophage, parasite, parasitoid and hyper-parasite), a high
degree of specialization was detected at the lower trophic
levels correlating with a greater relative abundance of host
species [8]. Thus, demographic characteristics (relative
abundance and distribution) of potential hosts were in
fact shown to predict the evolution of specialized races or
species of parasites [3].
Here we explore this hypothesis in the European cuckoo,
a generalist brood parasite with host races specializing in
parasitizing particular host species [9-11]. As any interspecific brood parasite, the European cuckoo lays its eggs in
the nests of other bird species, the hosts that incubate and
raise parasitic offspring. Because cuckoos often impose
severe fitness costs on parasitized hosts, recognition and
rejection of parasite eggs is of selective advantage for
hosts. On the other hand, mimicry of parasitic egg to
those of their hosts is advantageous for cuckoos because it
reduces the probability of hosts recognizing and rejecting
parasitic eggs. However, because egg appearance of different cuckoo host species may drastically differ, and a
cuckoo female lay eggs of a specific colour pattern [12],
but cannot change the appearance of their eggs depending
on the parasitized host species, the advantage of egg mimicry when parasitizing hosts with similar eggs became disadvantageous when parasitizing other suitable hosts.
Consequently, the evolution of different cuckoo egg
morphs that mimic eggs of their hosts reflects specialization occurring in some, but not all suitable host species
[13,14]. In accordance with the hypothesis of demographic characteristics of hosts affecting the resolution of
the trade-off for the ability to adapt optimally to different

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/88

hosts (see above), we predicted that specific egg-morphs
of European cuckoos should have evolved in hosts that
are evenly distributed at high density in their European
range.
To test this prediction suitable host species or genera were
classified as having or not having specialized egg morphs
(i.e., specific cuckoo gentes) following Moksnes and
Røskaft [9]. We collected information on population density of suitable host species for 12 European geographic
regions of similar area (Fig. 1). As an index of heterogeneity in population density, we estimated the coefficient of
variation (CV) in density among these twelve European
regions as an index of spatial distribution widely used in
ecology for characterizing uniformly (CV < 1), randomly
(CV = 1) or contagiously (CV > 1) distributed species [e.g.,
[15]].

Results
As expected from the hypothesis of parasite specialization
being more common in abundant and evenly distributed
hosts, we found that European cuckoos have evolved
host-specific egg morphs for host species with higher population density and lower coefficients of variation in population density in different regions. That was the case
independent of whether the analyses were based on species-specific data or phylogenetically independent contrasts (Table 1). These relationships were independent of
the allometric effects of body mass because the inclusion
of phylogenetic independent contrasts of body mass in a
multiple regression through the origin did not explain the
probability of evolution of specialized cuckoo-egg
morphs (with population density as a second independent variable: Beta (SE) = 0.154 (0.109), t62 = 1.41, P >
0.15); with CV of population density as a second independent variable: Beta (SE) = 0.174 (0.109), t62 = 1.60, P
> 0.1), and it did not affect the percentage of variance
explained by population density (Beta (SE) = 0.260
(0.109), t62 = 2.52, P = 0.02) or by coefficient of variation
in population density (Beta (SE) = -0.287 (0.109), t62 =
2.64, P = 0.01). Furthermore, the addition of duration of
the nestling period (the second variable explaining host
selection by cuckoos [16] to the model did not affect the
conclusions (Table 2)
When analyzing the relationship between the existence of
cuckoo egg-morphs and population density and CV at the
genus level, we found similar results. Populations of genera for which specialized cuckoo egg morphs had been
described, either at the level of species or genus, were
more dense and less heterogeneously distributed in
Europe than populations of genera for which a cuckoo
egg-morph had been described (Table 1; Fig. 2). Furthermore, the evolution of specialized cuckoo-egg morphs
was more common in genera that held a large number of
suitable host species (mean (SE): 4.70 (0.72) vs 1.71

Discussion
We found evidence suggesting that cuckoo gentes have
evolved more often in abundant suitable host species that
are evenly distributed across the European continent. The
interpretation of these results in a coevolutionary scenario
of specialization largely depends on evidence supporting
a genetic basis of cuckoo gentes on the one hand, and the

appropriateness of our estimates of host density and heterogeneity in distribution on the other. Below we discuss
these assumptions related to our estimates and the importance of our results for evolutionary scenarios of parasites
specializing on suitable hosts.
Host density at the European continental range was estimated for twelve different regions, mostly including more
than one country, while heterogeneity in distribution of
suitable hosts was estimated as the coefficient of variation
in population density in these twelve European regions.
These regions were of similar size and comprised most of
the European continent. The continental geographic scale
used here has the advantage of producing general estimations largely independent of local variation at geographic
local scales that do not capture general patterns in distribution of species. However, the level of heterogeneity in
estimated population densities would most likely increase
as the geographic scale decreases because heterogeneity in
variables explaining species distribution (e.g. habitat
requirements) also increases [17]. Therefore, if variation

Among species and genera comparisons of mean and coefficient of variation (CV) in population density of suitable host passerine species for which
the European cuckoo has or has not evolved specific gentes (i.e., highly mimetic egg morphs). Possible phylogenetic dependence of data was taken
into account by using pair-wise comparisons of closely related taxa (i.e., mean values of species with and without gentes within families) and
phylogenetically independent contrasts.

in habitat availability across geographic ranges is linked to
variation in habitat selection of different host species, the
geographic scale from which population density and level
of heterogeneity in population density was estimated will
be critical. A problem of non-stationary in our estimations
would mainly affect estimates for patchily distributed species such as warblers associated with particular habitats
(i.e. woodlands, wetlands) where they live at a high den-

sity. We explicitly attempted to quantify this potential
problem in our estimations, and following recommendations by Osborne & Suarez-Seoane [17] we calculated
density and coefficient of variation in density for more
reduced geographic areas within the same European
regions. We found that dividing regions into geographic
sub-samples did not produce estimates that differed significantly from the original estimates (see Material and

Methods). Therefore, we found no evidence of problems
related to spatial non-stationary estimates in our estimates of population density and heterogeneity in distribution [17].
The formation of parasite races involves genetic changes
that are part of adaptations to improve exploitation of a
particular host or environment. Size and colour patterns
of eggs have a strong genetic component [18,19] and vary
greatly among host species [e.g., [20,21]]. Furthermore,
strong evidence suggests that specific egg morphs with
genes coding for egg colour patterns are maternally inherited and most likely located on the female-specific Wchromosome [22]. Thus, egg-morphs of cuckoos that
mimic eggs of a single or few closely related host species
provide evidence for such specialization and race formation in the European cuckoo [13]. Here we used the ten
cuckoo egg morphs (i.e., gentes) assigned to a single host
species by Moksnes & Røskaft [9] in a study of egg collection at museums. Because the very large sample size and
broad geographic range used in that study, these cuckoo
egg-morphs is considered as evidence of host race evolution by cuckoos across Europe [11].
Specialization could occur for hosts that the parasites will
easily find [4]. Consequently, we predicted that cuckooegg morphs should have evolved for abundant host species [16]. In accordance, we found that cuckoo-egg
morphs have more frequently evolved in species of higher
average population density (see Results). These results
were not due to the use of species-specific cuckoo-egg
morphs exclusively because, when also including egg
morphs associated with entire genera, population density

Host density is a central species-specific trait explaining
specialization and speciation of parasites because it affects
probability of parasites locating preferred hosts. Specialization of parasites exploiting particular hosts invariably
provokes disadvantages when parasitizing other hosts,
and, consequently, the evolution of specialization can be
seen as a compromise between the use of the maximum
number of suitable hosts, and the use of the most frequent
suitable host encountered [4]. Furthermore, for similar
abundance of different suitable hosts, as the number of
species increases, the probability of parasite specializing
on a particular suitable host decreases. Consequently, relative host abundance is key to explaining host selection
and host specificity of parasites [see examples in [3]].
Although host abundance or related variables, sometimes
failed to explain host specificity [e.g., [23]], our results are
consistent with the hypothesis.
Another demographic trait that could affect host specialization by parasites is the consistency in host abundance at
different locations because, as density, it also affects the
probability of parasites locating a host species and, therefore, the trade-off in the ability to optimally parasitize different hosts [3]. In agreement with this demographic trait
being important for cuckoos, comparative evidence suggests that geographic range of potential hosts explains
host selection by the European cuckoo in Britain [16].
Therefore, specialization and race (i.e., gentes) formation
of cuckoos might have occurred in evenly distributed
hosts (see Introduction). Again, our results were consistent with the prediction (Table 1, Fig. 2). These results were
independent of the potential allometric effects of body
size and nestling period for both host selection and demographic characteristics because the inclusion of these variables in our statistical model did not change the
conclusions (see Results).
The hypothesis of specialization on the most predictable
(i.e., abundant and evenly distributed) host resource was
first introduced by Ward [5]. In a host-parasite system,
large body size, long-lived or abundant hosts are considered the most predictable resources for parasites because
living on a more predictable host may increase parasite
fecundity and survival [23]. Because host adaptation
might promote race formation and speciation by reducing
gene flow [24,25], those evolutionary processes should
more commonly occur in parasites that exploit the most
predictable and abundant hosts [3]. In accordance with
this line of reasoning, host specificity is more common in
hosts that live longer (i.e., of large body mass) [23,26-29].
However, as far as we know, empirical evidence for the
importance of heterogeneity in the distribution of hosts
on parasite specialization does not exist in the literature,

and, therefore, our results are the first to support this
hypothetical relationship.
The scarcity of evidence supporting the importance of
host density and distribution as variables related to predictability of resources (hosts) for parasites could be due
to the parasite-host model systems being used in previous

studies. Most of these studies were performed on internal
parasites of fishes and flies [see, [23], and references
therein] for which host body size is a variable that reflects
predictability of resources for parasites. Evidence for the
importance of host density explaining specialization by
parasites came mainly from plant-phytophagous insect
systems [see, [4]] where apart from size of hosts, host denPage 6 of 10

sity per se is an important variable reflecting predictability
of resources for adults or larvae. For cuckoos, abundance
and distribution of suitable hosts are variables that closely
reflect predictability of suitable host species (i.e.,
resources in brood parasite – host systems), which, as predicted by Norton and Carpenter [3], explains the association between these variables and probability of race
formation in the European cuckoo. Thus, the association
between patterns of geographic distribution of hosts
(population density and heterogeneity) and evolutionary
processes associated with specialization of parasites (i.e.,
speciation or evolution of races) should be predicted only
in the case when population density and heterogeneity of
distribution of hosts represent resource availability for
parasites as in the case of brood parasites.
We have found an association between probability of specialized egg morph evolution and number of suitable host
species within a genus. Although this result could suggest
a possible role of cuckoos in the diversification of host
genera, as in other parasite-host systems [2], it is more
likely that the specialization of cuckoos on diversified
host genera including abundant and homogeneously distributed species is of selective advantage. Closely related
bird species tend to lay similar eggs [30]. Moreover, host
ability to recognize foreign eggs depends on degree of
mimicry between host and parasitic egg [e.g., [31,32]],
and, thus, when egg-recognition ability improves in one
but not in other host species within a given genus, cuckoo
egg-morphs might still have success parasitizing some
species in the genus.

Conclusion
We have presented evidence suggesting that population
density and homogeneity of geographic distribution of
hosts explain the evolution of specialized egg-morphs of
the European cuckoo. These results are consistent with the
hypothesis that resource (i.e., host) predictability explains
the evolution of host races and species in parasites.

Methods
Cuckoo egg morphs
Information on specialization by the European cuckoo in
different host species is available from studies performed
at different localities by different authors [33,34], but also
from comparisons of cuckoo eggs stored at different
museums that were collected from a very wide geographic
range of localities [9]. We have in the present analyses followed Moksnes & Røskaft [9] who analyzed clutches from
27 different museum collections from 13 different European countries and established 15 cuckoo egg morphs;
ten of these were assigned to a single species of host. The
use of this classification has the advantage of being based
on the work of the same observers with the possibility of
comparing cuckoo eggs laid in nests of very different host
species. Furthermore, this classification was made before

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/88

we started our study, and thus the scientists performing
the classification of cuckoo gentes were unaware of the
hypothesis being tested here. After this classification some
other species-specific cuckoo egg morphs have been proposed as gentes occurring at a very local scale, although
these otherwise need further confirmation [33-35] and,
therefore, were not considered in the present study.
Moksnes & Røskaft [9] also classified potential hosts as
being unsuitable as cuckoo hosts, either because they are
hole-nesters, or because they feed their young with food
unsuitable for the cuckoo chick, or because they have
nests/eggs that are too large to permit successful ejection
by the young cuckoo [9]. Among suitable hosts, they distinguished between those with and without specific egg
morphs. We considered all suitable hosts and the greenfinch Carduelis chloris, a granivorous species that is known
to be able to successfully rear cuckoo nestlings [36]. Thus,
our analyses comprise data for 79 passerine species (see
Additional file 1). Moksnes & Røskaft [9] also described
five different morphs of cuckoo eggs that were not speciesspecific, but associated with entire passerine genera
(Fringilla, Sylvia, Anthus, Lanius and Emberiza). Thus, we
considered in our analyses suitable host species for which
cuckoos had and had not evolved species-specifics egg
morphs. At the level of genera, we considered those with
specialized described cuckoo-egg morphs together with
others that included suitable species with specific cuckoo
egg morphs as the genus for which cuckoos are specialized.
Information on body mass and the duration of the nesting
period was included in the models because these variables
are likely related to the quality of parental care (i.e., duration and feeding rates) that cuckoo nestlings receive when
reared by different host species, and, therefore, they could
affect host choice and the evolution of specialized cuckooegg morphs [16]. Data were obtained from Cramp [37]
and Soler et al. [16].
Demographic parameters
Estimation of population density and heterogeneity in
density was based on maximum and minimum numbers
of breeding pairs of different species reported by Tucker
and Heath [38] and Hagemeijer and Blair [39]. We started
with Tucker and Heath [38] by recording maximum and
minimum numbers of breeding pairs for the 31 countries
included in their appendix. Afterwards, for each species,
we looked for information on countries not explicitly
mentioned in Tucker and Heath's list, but within the topten list in Hagemeijer and Blair [39], where we recorded
minimum and maximum population size to be included
in our data set. For countries where the species was
present [based on maps in [39]], but with no information
on maximum and minimum numbers of breeding pairs
in either of the two books, maximum and minimum valPage 7 of 10

ues estimated for the group "other countries" in Hagemeijer and Blair [39] were distributed among countries
proportionally to the area of these countries (Fig. 1). That
was done after subtracting maximum and minimum population density of countries for which we collected data
from Tucker and Heath (1994) that were not present in
the top-ten list of Hagemeijer and Blair [39]. With these
minimum and maximum population sizes we estimated
geometric means for each species and country as
(e((log(minimum+1)+log(maximum+1))/2))), which is appropriate
for data of exponential nature as is the case for population
size. Population density for each species and country was
thus estimated as geometric means divided by area in
square kilometres. For the estimation of demographic
parameters at the level of genera, we pooled demographic
data of potential hosts within the same genus. For each
country we added minimum and maximum population
sizes estimated for all species within the same genus. Population density for each genus and country was estimated
as the geometric means of these maximum and minimum
values divided by area in square kilometres.
We tried to reduce variation in estimates of population
density related to size of different countries (i.e. the smallest countries might have reduced habitats diversity compared to large countries) by defining 12 different
geographic regions of similar area as shown in Fig. 1.
Importantly, by including more than one country in different geographic regions would allow us to estimate
repeatability of estimations for the same regions (see
below). For each of these geographic regions we summed
population sizes (geometric means) as well as the area of
each country within a region. Finally, for each species, we
estimated means, standard deviations, and sums of population geometric means and population density. Afterward, we estimated the coefficient of variation as the
percentage of the standard deviation divided by mean
population density, which by definition reflects variation
in population density of different areas (i.e., standard
deviation) controlled for mean population density. Coefficient of variation (CV) is an index of spatial distribution
widely used in ecology for characterizing uniformly (%CV
< 100), randomly (%CV = 100) or contagiously (%CV >
100) distributed species [15]. Thus, low and high CV-values would indicate homogeneous and heterogeneous distributions, respectively.
Reliability of such heterogeneity values was tested by
means of repeatability estimations. First, we estimated
repeatability of values for different countries within the
same regions. Briefly, for the nine European regions with
more than one country we selected the two countries with
the largest area. Then, we estimated the means and the
coefficient of variation of densities of the nine regions for
all analyzed species taking into account countries with the
largest area within each region on the one hand, and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/88

countries with the second largest area within each European region on the other hand. Finally, repeatability of
these values for species that appeared in both data sets was
estimated by means of one-way ANOVAs. Both repeatability of mean (R = 51.0%, F = 3.38, df = 73, 74, P < 0.0001)
and that of coefficient of variation of population density
(R = 65.5%, F = 4.80, df = 73, 74, P < 0.0001) estimated
for all analyzed species were highly significant. These
results indicate that estimations for our twelve European
regions are not influenced by the identity of countries
within the same region or any associated difference (e.g.,
countries using different sampling methods or effort, or
habitat diversity varying between countries) and validate
the use of mean values per area.
Second, to rule out the possibility that our estimations
depended on the European regions included in the analyses, we estimated means and coefficients of variation of
population density for each species by taking into account
regions with even and uneven identification numbers in
Table 1, separately. Finally, we used one-way ANOVAs to
estimate repeatability of means and coefficients of variation of population size estimated for different species
using the two groups of European regions. Again, both
mean (R = 84.6%, F = 12.01, df = 78, 79, P < 0.0001) and
coefficient of variation of population density (R = 72.9%,
F = 6.39, df = 78, 79, P < 0.0001) estimated for all species
were significantly repeatable. These results indicate that
our estimates of population density and heterogeneity do
not depend on the European region for which data were
collected and, consequently, our estimates can be considered species-specific characteristics.
Comparative analyses
Phylogenetic relationships among different species were
based on recent publications [40-42] (Fig. 3). We
assumed all polytomies (N = 14) to be unresolved. Branch
lengths were assigned using three different methodologies: (i) all were set equal to one; (ii) by arbitrarily assigning all inter-node branch segments equal to one, but
constraining tips to be contemporaneous [43]; and (iii)
by tips being contemporaneous, the depth of each node
being arbitrarily set to one less the number of tip species
that descended from it [44].

To control for the possible effect of common phylogenetic
descent, we used Felsenstein's [45] independent comparison method as implemented in the computer program
PDAP (Vers. 6.0, module PDTREE) by Garland et al. [46]
and Garland & Ives [47]. This method finds a set of independent pair-wise differences or contrasts, assuming that
changes along the branches of the phylogeny can be modelled by a Brownian motion process (successive changes
are independent of one another), and that the expected
total change over many independent changes is zero [48].
Therefore, pair-wise differences in the phylogenetic tree

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/88

are independent of each other [48]. The advantage of the
independent comparison approach is that, by partitioning
the variation appropriately, all contrasts can be used to
assess a hypothetical comparative relationship [48]. These
contrasts were estimated for each variable using the three
kinds of trees differing in branch length (see above).
Moreover, to check whether the contrasts were independent of branch length, we plotted absolute contrast values
versus their standard deviations (square roots of sums of
corrected branch lengths) [43,49,50]. After Bonferroni
correction, in no case did we find a significant correlation
when branch lengths were all adjusted to one, but when
using arbitrary methods of Pagel and Grafen, absolute values of contrasts of population density were significantly
related to the standard deviation (P < 0.05). Thus, for all
variables we used estimated contrasts when branch
lengths were arbitrarily assigned to one. These were subsequently used in multiple regression analyses through the
origin, using the existence of specific cuckoo races for a
target host species or genus (dependent variable: dummy
continuous variable with values 1 and 0, respectively,
indicating species with and without cuckoo gentes), and
the mean and coefficient of variation in host population
density (independent variables). Conservatively, we estimated degrees of freedom by subtracting the number of
polytomies in the phylogenetic trees from those estimated
by the statistical program, and we used two-tailed P-values.

After natural logarithmic transformations distributions of
both mean and coefficient of variation of population density did not differ significantly from normality (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for continuous variables, P > 0.15).
Values reported are means (SE).

Authors' contributions
JJS, APM, and MMV contributed equally to the conception
and design of the study. JJS and MMV collected the necessary data from the European breeding bird atlas for estimates of population density of suitable hosts in different
European regions. JJS wrote a first draft that was revised
critically by APM and MMV. All authors have given final
approval of the version to be published.
