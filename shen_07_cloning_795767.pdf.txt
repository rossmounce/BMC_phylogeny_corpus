Abstract
Genotype 4 hepatitis E virus (HEV) was reportedly transmitted freely between humans and swine
in eastern China. The full-length genomic sequence of Shanghai swine isolate (SH-SW-zs1)
recovered from feces sample of a pig which was infected with HEV RNA positive swine serum was
determined using RT-PCR and RACE (Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends) methods. The full
genome of the SH-SW-zs1 isolate was 7265 nucleotides in length and phylogenetic analysis
indicated that this isolate belonged to genotype 4. Comparison of the 3' UTR sequence with the
corresponding regions of other 38 HEV strains from different region revealed that the Shanghai
swine isolate is 21–49 bp longer than the other stains.

Introduction
Hepatitis E is an important public health disease in many
developing countries of Asia and Africa and also occurs
sporadically in some industrialized countries [1-4]. The
disease mainly affects young adults and has a relatively
high mortality of up to 25% in affected pregnant women
[1]. The main mode of transmission of hepatitis E virus
(HEV) is fecal-oral route, primarily through contaminated
water supplies [1]. HEV is single-stranded, positive-sense
RNA virus without an envelope [5]. The genome of HEV is
approximately 7.2 Kb and consists three open reading
frames (ORF1–3) [6]. ORF1 locates at the 5 ' end of
genome and encodes non-structural proteins, including
the methyltransferase, protease, helicase and RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) [7]. ORF2 maps to
the 3 ' terminus and encodes for a major structural protein, and ORF3 overlaps both and encodes a thus far

unknown function [6]. Based on sequence analysis, HEV
sequences have been classified into four major genotypes
(1–4). Genotype 1 is the main cause of hepatitis E in
developing countries in Asia and Africa, and genotype 2
has been documented in Mexico and Nigeria. Genotype 3
or 4 have been described in the United States, European
countries, China, Taiwan, and Japan [8,9]. The virus is
also prevalent in swine, and isolates from swine are genetically closely related to that from humans [10-12]. Lots of
researches showed that genotype 4 and genotype 1 were
the major genotype in China, recently genotype 3 HEV
was reported in swine of Shanghai suburb [13]. For the
further research, such as genomic characteristics and phylogenetic analysis, the full genome of the isolate which
was proved prevalent in Shanghai swine was determined
in the current study.

Materials and methods
Samples
132 serum samples of swine were collected from Shanghai
suburb in China. These samples were tested for HEV RNA,
using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR). One HEV RNA positive swine serum sample was
used for experimental infection of pigs [14]. HEV RNA
positive swine fecal samples were stored as 10% suspension in aliquots at 70°C. About 10 g of HEV RNA positive
fecal sample was converted to 10% (w/v) suspensions in
PBS (0.01 M, pH 7.2–7.4, added 0.1% DEPC) for determining the full genomic sequence of HEV.
Viral RNA extraction
One hundred microlitre of fecal suspensions was mixed
with 1 ml of trizol (invitrogen, USA). The mixture was
homogenized and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Two hundred microlitre of chloroform was added
and the mixture was vigorously shaken for 15 s and incubated at room temperature for 3 min. The aqueous phase
was transferred to a fresh microfuge tube after centrifugation at 12 000 g for 15 min at 4°C. Five hundred microlitre of isopropyl was added and the mixture was incubated
for 15 min at room temperatures. Then centrifuging at 12
000 g at 4°C for 15 min. After discarding the supernatant,
RNA pellet was washed with 1 ml 75% ethanol. The RNA
pellet was Dried at room temperature for 5 min after centrifuging at 5 000 g for 5 min at 4°C and Discarding the
supernatant. RNA sample was dissolved with 20 ul DEPCtreated water and used to reverse transcription immediately.
PCR amplification
Full-length primers: 18 sets of degenerate primers were
designed based on a multiple sequence alignment of
entire genome from isolates AY594199, DQ279091,
DQ450072 and AB108537 (table 1). Reverse transcription was carried out at 42°C for 1 h with 1 ul (200 units)
of AMV Reverse Transcriptase (TakaRa, Japan) and 1 ul
(25 mM) of external antisense primer. The first round PCR
was carried using 10 ul of the synthesized cDNA and an
external set of forward and reverse primers with Ex Taq
DNA polymerase (TakaRa, Japan). A nested PCR was carried out with internal primer set and 5 ul of the first PCR
product. The PCR parameters of all amplification reactions included an initial incubation at 95°C for 9 min,
followed by 39 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 1 min,
annealing for 1 min at a temperature varied according to
the Tm of different primers, and extension at 72°C for 1.5
min, with a final incubation at 72°C for 7 min. The resulting PCR products were excised from agarose gel and purified using the Axyprep DNA Gel Extraction Kit (AXYGEN,
USA). The purified PCR products were ligated into
PMD18-T vector (TakaRa, Japan) using T4 DNA ligase
(TakaRa, Japan) at 16°C overnight. The recombinant plas-

http://www.virologyj.com/content/4/1/98

mid was transformed into DH5α competent Escherichia
coli cells (TakaRa, Japan). Plasmids containing the insert
fragment were identified by PCR. Three of the positive
clones were sequenced.
5'RACE
The 5'RACE was carried out with the 5-Full RACE Core Set
(TaKaRa, Japan) kit following the manufacture's instructions. Briefly, 1st strand cDNA was Synthesized by reverse
transcription using 5'end-phosphorylated RT Primer
which was specific to the swine HEV (5'-p-GTCATRCCRTGGCG-3'). The PCR reaction mixture was incubated for 2
min at 94°C followed by 35 amplification cycles, comprising denaturation at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at 65°C
for 30 s and extension at 72°C for 30 s. The reaction was
extended for another 7 min at 72°C to insure the full
extension. Fifteen ul of 1st Strand cDNA was treated with
RNase H in a total 75 µl reaction mixture containing 15 ul
of Hybrid RNA Degeneration Buffer for 1 h at 30°C. The
mixture was then precipitated at -20°C for 30 min, being
added 100 ul of H2O and 500 ul 100% ethanol. The
supernatant was discarded and the pellet was washed with
75% ethanol after centrifuging at 12 000 g for 5 min. The
pellet was dissolved with 8 ul of RNA (ssDNA) Ligation
Buffer and 12 ul of H2O after dried at room temperature
for 5 min. 20 ul of 40% PEG-6000 and 1 ul of ligase were
added and incubated at 16°C overnight. Fifteen microliters of circled cDNA was then used as template for nested
PCR using ExTaq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa, Japan)with
two sets of primers: 5'-CGGAGTTGGCCGCTGCTAGAG3'(external forward primer, nucleotide position numbers
104 to 84), 5'-TGTACT(G)TTTGCTGCTGAGAC-3'(external reverse primer, nucleotide position numbers 482 to
501), 5'-ATTGGGTGATTCCACAG(A)AACCTC-3'(internal forward primer, nucleotide position numbers 225 to
203), and 5'-ATCCACAAC(T)GAGCTT(C)GAGCAG3'(internal reverse primer, nucleotide position numbers
236 to 256). The PCR reaction mixture was incubated for
2 min at 94°C followed by 35 amplification cycles, comprising denaturation at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at 65°C
for 30 s and extension at 72°C for 30 s. The reaction was
extended for another 7 min at 72°C to insure the full
extension. The final PCR product was analyzed on 20 g/L
agarose gel.
3'RACE
The 3'RACE was carried out with the TaKaRa RNA PCR Kit
(TaKaRa, japan) following the manufacture's instructions.
Brifely, ten microliters of the HEV RNA was used as template to synthesize cDNA with AMV Reverse transcriptase
for 1 h at 42°C. The external reverse primer (HE17A)
which has a poly (T) tract was used to prime the cDNA
synthesis. The cDNA was then amplified by nested PCR
with the external forward primer (5'-CGCTCACTACTATCCAGCAG-3', nucleotide position numbers 6763–6782)

Results
3'RACE
As shown in Figure 1, 3'RACE band of the expected size
was obtained. The 3' terminus of this study had 93 nucleotides upstream of the polyA. The sequence of 3'UTR was:
TTT ATT CTT CTT GTA CCT CCC CTT CGG TTC TGT TTC
TTT TTA TTT CTC CTT TCT GCG TTC CGC GCT CAC TAC
TAT CCA GCA GGA TCC ATG TTG. Comparison of the
3'UTR sequence with the corresponding regions of other
38 HEV strains from different region of the world revealed
that the Shanghai swine isolate is 21–49 bp longer than
all the other stains (additional file).
Analysis of Full-Length Genome of Shanghai Isolate
The genomic length of the SH-SW-zs1 isolate was determined to be 7265 nucleotides (nt) excluding poly (A) tail
at 3' terminus and contained three open reading frames
(ORFs) similar to earlier reported human and swine HEV
isolates. The genomic organization consisted of 5'
untranslated region (5'UTR) of 25 nt (1–25), ORF-1 of
5127 nt (26–5152), ORF-2 of 1983 nt (5190–7172),
ORF-3 of 372 nt (5249–5520) and 3'UTR of 93 nt (7173–
7265), followed by a poly (A) tail of 26 residues. The

HEV is the major cause of enterically transmitted non-A,
non-B, non-C hepatitis and is responsible for significant
morbidity and mortality in developing countries [16].
Outbreaks of hepatitis E have been described in Asia,
Africa and Mexico [16-18], while sporadic cases have been
reported in the United States, Japan and other developed
countries [8]. It has been shown that HEV is a zoonotic
virus [19,20]. Hitherto, the lack of an efficient cell-culture
system for HEV has greatly hampered detailed analysis of
the virus replication cycle in infected cells, which makes it
difficult to resolve many important questions. Meanwhile, cloning full-length genome of HEV is an efficient
way to analysis molecular character, viral replication and
other problems. Some reports indicated that genotype 4
and genotype 1 were the major genotype in China, though
genotype 3 HEV was recently found in swine of Shanghai
suburb [13]. Recent observations suggested that the HEV
genotype influences the severity of hepatitis E, and that
genotype 4 is associated more strongly with the severe
form of hepatitis E than genotype 3 [21]. Therefore, the
genomic full-length of the Shanghai isolate was determined in this study for further demonstrating the HEV
strain prevalent in eastern China. The full genome of the
SH-SW-zs1 isolate was 7265 nucleotides in length and
phylogenetic analysis indicated that this isolate belonged
to genotype 4. This isolate closely clustered with isolate
DQ450072 and they shared 89.3% identity(with divergence of 11.3%) with each other and represented a distinct subgroup among the genotype 4 isolates with a
bootstrap value of 100%, thus suggested that they may
come from one common strain. Result of comparison
showed that the 3'UTR of this Shanghai isolate was 21–49
bp longer than all the other stains so far avalible on-line.
By blast the 21-nt-fragment in GenBank, we found it has
many homologous sequences which shared more than
85% identity with it. So we presumed that this fragment
may come from the recombination of genome HEV and
its host or other microorganism. The true origin of this
short fragment and its specific function need to be further
studied.

length of 5'UTR was same as that of other type 4 isolates
and had nucleotide G at the extreme 5' end of the genome
as other reported genotype 4 sequences. Whole genomebased phylogenetic analysis confirmed classification of
Shanghai swine in genotype 4 (Fig. 2). The phylogenetic
tree showed that genotype 4 could be divided into 3 main
subgroups. SH-SW-zs1 isolate closely clustered with iso-
