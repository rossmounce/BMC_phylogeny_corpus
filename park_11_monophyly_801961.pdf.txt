Abstract
Background: The orders Ascaridida, Oxyurida, and Spirurida represent major components of zooparasitic
nematode diversity, including many species of veterinary and medical importance. Phylum-wide nematode
phylogenetic hypotheses have mainly been based on nuclear rDNA sequences, but more recently complete
mitochondrial (mtDNA) gene sequences have provided another source of molecular information to evaluate
relationships. Although there is much agreement between nuclear rDNA and mtDNA phylogenies, relationships
among certain major clades are different. In this study we report that mtDNA sequences do not support the
monophyly of Ascaridida, Oxyurida and Spirurida (clade III) in contrast to results for nuclear rDNA. Results from
mtDNA genomes show promise as an additional independently evolving genome for developing phylogenetic
hypotheses for nematodes, although substantially increased taxon sampling is needed for enhanced comparative
value with nuclear rDNA. Ultimately, topological incongruence (and congruence) between nuclear rDNA and
mtDNA phylogenetic hypotheses will need to be tested relative to additional independent loci that provide
appropriate levels of resolution.
Results: For this comparative phylogenetic study, we determined the complete mitochondrial genome sequences
of three nematode species, Cucullanus robustus (13,972 bp) representing Ascaridida, Wellcomia siamensis (14,128 bp)
representing Oxyurida, and Heliconema longissimum (13,610 bp) representing Spirurida. These new sequences were
used along with 33 published nematode mitochondrial genomes to investigate phylogenetic relationships among
chromadorean orders. Phylogenetic analyses of both nucleotide and amino acid sequence datasets support the
hypothesis that Ascaridida is nested within Rhabditida. The position of Oxyurida within Chromadorea varies among
analyses; in most analyses this order is sister to the Ascaridida plus Rhabditida clade, with representative Spirurida
forming a distinct clade, however, in one case Oxyurida is sister to Spirurida. Ascaridida, Oxyurida, and Spirurida
(the sampled clade III taxa) do not form a monophyletic group based on complete mitochondrial DNA sequences.
Tree topology tests revealed that constraining clade III taxa to be monophyletic, given the mtDNA datasets
analyzed, was a significantly worse result.
Conclusion: The phylogenetic hypotheses from comparative analysis of the complete mitochondrial genome data
(analysis of nucleotide and amino acid datasets, and nucleotide data excluding 3rd positions) indicates that
nematodes representing Ascaridida, Oxyurida and Spirurida do not share an exclusive most recent common
ancestor, in contrast to published results based on nuclear ribosomal DNA. Overall, mtDNA genome data provides
reliable support for nematode relationships that often corroborates findings based on nuclear rDNA. It is
anticipated that additional taxonomic sampling will provide a wealth of information on mitochondrial genome
evolution and sequence data for developing phylogenetic hypotheses for the phylum Nematoda.

Background
The phylum Nematoda (roundworms) is an ecologically
diverse clade, that has significant impact as parasites of
animals and plants, along with providing a diverse array
of ecosystem services as free-living species in many
environments [1-3]. Parasitic nematodes include many
species that negatively impact human health, agricultural production, wildlife, and companion animals [4].
Free-living nematode species occur in almost every
environment, particularly soils and aquatic sediments
and serve important roles in food webs, particularly as
decomposers and predators [5]. Despite their biodiversity, ubiquity, and important impacts, molecular phylogenetic hypotheses for major groups of nematodes,
including zooparasitic species, are somewhat lacking
when compared to recent advances for other organisms.
In addition, prior to the application of molecular data,
hypotheses of evolutionary relationships for nematodes
relied heavily on interpretation of a limited number of
“key morphological characters” or placed excessive
emphasis on ecological features; as a result, different
investigators recovered different relationships, with
resulting debate concerning nematode classification systems (see [6]). During the last 20 years, molecular
sequence data have been employed for nematode phylogenetics and have provided testable hypotheses at different levels, from across the phylum to within genera.
The vast majority of these studies have been based on
gene sequences representing a single nuclear locus,
ribosomal DNA (e.g., 18S, 28S, and ITS genes). Such
ribosomal DNA studies have included phylum-wide
investigations [7-9], studies focused on particular clades
identified in phylum-wide investigations (Clade III sensu
[7];[10]), evaluation of traditional orders or suborders
(Cephalobina [11]; Strongylida [12]; Tylenchina [13,14]),
and examination of particular genera [15-17]. The first
phylum-wide molecular phylogeny of nematodes [7]
recognized five major clades. Only one of these groups
(clade III) was exclusively composed of animal parasites.
This clade represents four traditional orders (Ascaridida,
Spirurida, Rhigonematida and Oxyurida), and includes
many species of veterinary and medical importance. A
revised classification system, based on interpretation of
SSU (18S) rDNA phylogenetic trees, has been proposed
with each traditional clade III order given infraordinal
status within Rhabditida, suborder Spirurina [6,18], and
renamed Ascaridomorpha, Spiruromorpha, Rhigonematomorpha and Oxyuridomorpha. Relatively comprehensive sampling and analysis of clade III taxa (103 taxa)

using SSU sequences generally supported clade III
monophyly (102/103 taxa were monophyletic) and that
of Oxyurida, but not monophyly of Ascaridida or Spirurida as traditionally defined [10]. However, relationships among the major clade III orders were not
reliably resolved by SSU data, with major differences
among phylogenetic trees according to inference
method, and inclusion or exclusion of characters judged
to be ambiguous with respect to positional (alignment)
homology [10].
Analyses of complete mitochondrial genome sequences
have provided an alternative hypothesis for relationships
among clade III taxa [19-21]. These mitochondrial trees
supported a closer relationship between Rhabditida and
Ascaridida, with the single oxyurid species in the analysis
sister to Rhabditida+Ascaridida, and this latter clade sister to Spirurida. The mtDNA tree topology conflicts with
results based on SSU rDNA, which strongly supports
monophyly of taxa representing the sampled superfamilies and orders [10]. The recent development of highthroughput approaches for sequencing and annotating
mitochondrial genomes [22] holds great promise for
increasing the representation of nematode mtDNA genomes for analysis, and has already yielded several new
strongylid sequences analyzed herein. However, highthroughput approaches have not yet been applied to
increase taxon sampling for clade III nematodes, which
remain sparse at most taxonomic levels, including the
absence of orders (e.g., clade III, Rhigonematida). The
great majority of mitochondrial genome sequences for
chromadorean nematodes are derived from the Rhabditida (24 out of 36 species). In contrast, Oxyurida is represented by one species, and although Spirurida and
Ascaridida are represented by multiple species, each of
these orders includes a single superfamily (Filarioidea
and Ascaridoidea). Improving the comparative utility of
mtDNA phylogenetics requires broadened taxonomic
sampling of nematode mitochondrial genomes.
In this study, we determined the complete mitochondrial genome sequences of three zooparasitic clade III
nematode species: Cucullanus robustus, the first representative of the superfamily Seuratoidea (Ascaridida),
Wellcomia siamensis, the second representative of the
Oxyurida, and Heliconema longissimum, the first representative of the superfamily Physalopteroidea (Spirurida). We also used these data and complete mtDNA
sequences from GenBank to infer phylogenetic relationships among major groups of enoplean and chromadorean nematodes.

Results and discussion
Gene organization and content

The complete mitochondrial genomes of C. robustus
(GenBank accession number: GQ332426), W. siamensis
(GenBank accession number: GQ332427) and H. longissimum (GenBank accession number:GQ332423) are
13,972 bp, 14,128 bp and 13,610 bp in length, respectively. The mitochondrial genomes of all three species
contain 12 protein coding genes (cox1-3, nad1-6, nad4L,
cob, and atp6), 22 transfer RNA genes and 2 ribosomal
RNA genes (rrnS and rrnL), as found in almost all other
nematode mitochondrial genomes reported so far. The
exception is Trichinella spiralis, which also contains
atp8 [23]. All 36 genes of each mitochondrial genome
are encoded in the same direction with very small intergenic spacer regions (Additional file 1A-C). The genome
organizations of each species are shown in Table 1. As
previously reported for other nematode mtDNAs, the
overall A+T content is very high (Table 2) with average
A+T contents of 79.1% for H. longissimum (52.9% T,
26.2% A, 6.7% C and 14.1% G), 77.9% for W. siamensis
(52.6% T, 25.3% A, 4.7% C and 17.4% G), and 71.6% for
C. robustus (47% T, 24.6% A, 9.1% C and 19.2% G).
Protein-coding genes and codon usage

Twelve protein-coding genes were identified for each of
the three species (Table 1), ranging in size from 234 bp
(nad4L) for C. robustus, W. siamensis and H. longissimum to 1,593 bp (cox1) for H. longissimum. For the 12
protein-coding genes of C. robustus, five (atp6, cob,
nad4L, nad5 and nad6) are inferred to use ATT as the
start codon, whereas the other seven (cox1, cox2, cox3,
nad1, nad2, nad3 and nad4) use TTG. In H. longissimum, six genes (cox1, cox2, cox3, nad5, cob and atp6)
are inferred to start with ATT, four others (nad3, nad4,
nad4L and nad6) start with ATA, and nad1 and nad2
use TTG as the start codon. In W. siamensis, eight
genes (cox3, nad2, nad3, nad4L, nad5, nad6, atp6 and
cob) are inferred to use TTG as the start codon, three
genes (cox2, nad1 and nad4) start with ATT, and cox1
uses ATA as the start codon. For C. robustus, eight
genes are inferred to use TAA as the termination codon
(cox2, nad2, nad3, nad4, nad4L, nad5, nad6 and atp6)
and two use TAG (cox1 and nad1). In H. longissimum,
TAA is also the most commonly used termination
codon (cox1, cox2, nad2, cox3, nad4, nad4L and nad6)
whereas TAG is used for three genes (nad3, nad5 and
atp6). For W. siamensis, TAG is used as the termination
codon for six genes (cox3, nad1, nad4, nad4L, nad5 and
nad6), whereas TAA is used only for the cob gene. Termination with the incomplete codon T is inferred for
cox3 and cob of C. robustus and nad1 and cob of H.
longissimum. The incomplete termination codon T is
used in high frequency (five of 12 genes) for W.

siamensis (cox1, cox2, nad2, nad3 and atp6). Start and
termination codons are shown for each species in Table
1. The protein-coding genes of the three mitochondrial
genomes are composed of amino acids that are encoded
by T-rich codons, as has been previously documented
for all major clades of chromadorean nematodes (Onchocerca volvulus, Spirurida [24]; Strongyloides stercoralis,
Rhabditida [19]; Anisakis simplex, Ascaridida [20]; Toxocara spp., Ascaridida [25]; Enterobius vermicularis, Oxyurida [21]). The six most frequently used codons are all
T-rich (having more than two Ts in a triplet): TTT
(13.1%), TTA (6.91%), TTG (6.56%), ATT (5.71%), GTT
(5.1%), and TCT (4.48%) in C. robustus; TTT (18.88%),
TTA (8.78%), ATT (7.55%), GTT (7.11%), TTG (6.08%),
and TAT (5.02%) in W. siamensis; TTT (18.0%), TTA
(9.41%), ATT (8.82%), TAT (6.01%), GTT (3.96%), and
TCT (3.69%) in H. longissimum. These T-rich codons
account for almost half of all codons used (Additional
file 2) in these three species (43.3% in C. robustus,
53.4% in W. siamensis, and 49.9% in H. longissimum). In
addition, unequal use of synonymous codons, especially
bias against codons with C in the third position is very
prominent in four-fold and two-fold degenerate codon
families. For instance, the relative frequency of phenylalanine encoded by TTC is strikingly decreased in each
species (1.26% in C. robustus, 0.06% in W. siamensis,
and 0.35% in H. longissimum). These factors (higher frequency of T-rich codons and unequal usage of synonymous codons with bias against C-rich codons) correlate
with the high percentage of A+T content in the nucleotide composition of protein-coding genes (A+T content
of 69.6%, 76.9%, and 77.8% for C. robustus, W. siamensis, and H. longissimum, respectively; Table 2).
Ribosomal RNA and Transfer rRNA genes

The small subunit ribosomal RNA (rrnS) and large
subunit ribosomal RNA (rrnL) of each mtDNA were
initially identified by comparison with related species
of the same orders. It was not possible to confirm the
exact starting and ending positions of the two ribosomal RNA genes, therefore the entire flanking regions
between the boundaries of their respective adjoining
genes were estimated as rrnS and rrnL in each species
(Table 1). The rrnS of C. robustus, W. siamensis and
H. longissimum is 677 bp, 732 bp, and 682 bp in size,
respectively. The total length of rrnL is 958 bp in C.
robustus, 953 bp in W. siamensis, and 973 bp in H.
longissimum. The predicted secondary structures of 22
tRNAs for each of the three species (Additional file 3)
are similar to those reported from a variety of other
nematode species (except Trichinella spiralis; [23]).
For example, all these tRNAs, except for trnS1 and
trnS2, lack a TΨC and instead are equipped with a
TV-replacement loop; in addition, trnS1 and trnS2 lack

methods for nucleotide and amino acid sequence datasets for the 12 protein-coding genes common to all the
species. The concatenated dataset for nucleotide and
amino acid sequences comprised 11,727 and 3,909
aligned characters, respectively. In addition, the nucleotide dataset was analyzed after excluding 3rd codon positions (7,818 characters). This was performed to assess
the possible impact of third codon position saturation
on reconstructing mtDNA phylogeny, particularly at
deeper levels (Figures 1, 2, 3 and 4). Overall, relationships inferred from Bayesian analysis of amino acids differed in several respects from the analyses of
nucleotides, with the AA tree recovering somewhat
fewer clades consistent with classical taxonomy. Relationships among taxa within each sampled superfamily
were in broad agreement irrespective of different data
types (nucleotide versus amino acid sequences) and different analytic methods, with relatively minor topology
differences (Figures 1, 2, 3 and 4) that are discussed
subsequently. Considering orders represented by two or
more taxa, Oxyurida, Spirurida, and Mermithida were
each monophyletic in all analyses with very high nodal
support. Ascaridida was monophyletic in three of four
analyses (not in Bayesian analysis of AA data), and
Rhabditida was not monophyletic in any analysis. Representatives of Enoplea were monophyletic in three of
four analyses (not in ML analysis of all nt data). Chromadorean species were a monophyletic group with very
high nodal support in all analyses. Relationships among
certain enoplean species differed between these datasets
and methods. In ML analysis of all nucleotide data (Figure 1), enopleans were not monophyletic, with a dorylaimid (Xiphinema americanum), mermithids, and a
trichocephalid (Trichinella spiralis), each forming successive sister groups to the chromadoreans. In other
analyses (Figures 2, 3 and 4), X. americanum was more
closely related to other enopleans, but with unreliable

nodal support in some cases. The unstable position of
X. americanum may be due to its long branch length
(not shown) relative to other enoplean taxa. Reversals of
strand-specific nucleotide bias in mtDNA can lead to
convergences in sequence composition and long branch
artifacts that can mislead phylogenetic analyses [30,31].
For nematode mitochondrial genomes, differences in
patterns of strand-specific bias among species are only
beginning to be investigated, but it is known that the
mtDNA molecules of Chromadorean species have relatively conserved synteny and genes that are encoded on
the same strand, whereas genes of Enoplean species are
encoded by both strands and show much greater variation in organization [32]. The use of both DNA strands
to encode genes may be more conducive to producing
convergence through mutational constraints and introduction of potential bias affecting phylogenetic analyses
[30].
Some chromadorean taxa also showed variation in phylogenetic position among analyses and between datasets.
Some of these differences likely reflect differences in
potential resolution of different datasets (e.g., amino acid
characters versus nucleotide data). For example, relationships within superfamilies of Rhabditida often received
higher ML bootstrap values in analyses of all nucleotides
than the dataset that excluded 3 rd positions of codons.
ML and BI analyses of the nucleotide datasets recovered
all Ascaridida (including C. robustus) as monophyletic
(99% BP), whereas in the BI of amino acid data (Figure
2), C. robustus (Seuratoidea) was sister (with high posterior probability; 0.99 BPP) to a group of Ascaridida and
Rhabditida. Notably, one molecular phylogeny based on
nuclear SSU rDNA also yielded an unexpected relationship for a different seuratoid genus, indicating more
recent common ancestry with members of Rhabditida
and Diplogasterida [10]. Similarly, although the position
of Steinernema carpocapsae (an entomopathogenic

was unstable and poorly supported in analyses of nucleotide data. Steinernema has also been of unstable or conflicting phylogenetic position in analyses of SSU and LSU
nuclear ribosomal DNA [7,11,33]. In some recent classifications reflecting certain SSU trees [6], Steinernema and
Strongyloides have been placed in the same superfamily

(Strongyloidoidea), and this taxonomic convention was
followed in this study. However, Steinernema plus Strongyloides was never recovered as monophyletic in analyses
of mitochondrial genome data, and instead Steinernema
was more closely related to other Rhabditida plus Ascaridida (Figures 1, 3 and 4). Analysis of nuclear LSU rDNA
also depicts Steinernema as more closely related to Rhabditida such as Caenorhabditis and Heterorhabditis than

to Strongyloides [11]. Although some studies based on
nuclear SSU rDNA have depicted Steinernema as sister
to Strongyloides and closely related to free living Panagrolaimoidea [7,8], other studies have found the position
of this genus to be unresolved by SSU sequences [33].
Perhaps factors influencing the unstable phylogenetic
position of Steinernema are common to ribosomal DNA
and mtDNA genes, and resolving the position of this
important entomopathogenic genus will require
sequences from other loci.

Certain older classifications emphasizing vertebrate
parasites [34,35] have included Strongyloides within
Rhabditoidea. In analyses of mtDNA genome data,
Strongyloides stercoralis was recovered as the sister
taxon to the Ascaridida+Rhabditida clade with very
robust nodal support in all analyses (Figures 1, 2, 3
and 4). This position of S. stercoralis does not conflict
with results obtained from analysis of nuclear ribosomal DNA, although trees inferred from LSU rDNA
showed instability of topology that may result from

Figure 4 Phylogenetic tree from Bayesian analysis of nucleotide sequences for 12 protein-coding genes with third codon positions
removed (7,818 characters). The best-fit substitution model for each of 12 genes was estimated using the AIC criterion implemented in
MrModeltest 2.3 [58]. The resulting best-fit model for each of 12 genes was then used for Bayesian analysis. Bayesian posterior probability values
(BPP), shown above the nodes, were estimated after the initial one-third of the trees was discarded as burn-in (see methods for analysis details).

that break long branches are believed to be particularly
valuable additions.
Of eight superfamiles within Chromadorea represented by two or more species, five were monophyletic
in all analyses (Trichostronyloidea, Rhabditoidea, Ascaridoidea, Oxyuroidea, and Filarioidea). Strongyloidoidea
and Ancylostomatoidea (hookworms), were not monophyletic in any analysis, whereas Strongyloidea was
monophyletic in three of four analyses (not in Bayesian

analysis of AA data; Figure 2). Relationships among the
five filarioid species were identical among the different
inference methods and datasets, and these groups
received strong nodal support. Tree topology for relationships among clade III orders was not consistent
among the analyses, but in no case was clade III monophyletic. In addition, the four Ascaridida species were
nested within Rhabitida in all analyses. Comparison of
the best tree for all nucleotide data (Figure 1) with the

Park et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:392
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/392

optimal ML tree for this dataset constrained for clade III
monophyly (tree topology provided in Methods), indicated that monophyly of clade III was a significantly
worse interpretation of these data (Shimodaira-Hasegawa test, P < 0.05). Similarly, the S-H test revealed that
the best ML tree consistent with clade III monophyly
for the dataset excluding 3rd positions was significantly
worse (P < 0.05) than the best ML tree (Figure 3) for
these data. The deepest node including all Rhabditida
and Ascaridida had 100% bootstrap support (ML analyses) or 1.00 posterior probability (Bayesian analyses).
In three of four analyses (Figures 1, 2 and 3), oxyurids
were sister to Ascaridida plus Rhabditida but with
strong nodal support only for analyses of the amino acid
dataset. In the Bayesian analysis of nucleotide data
excluding 3rd positions (Figure 4), oxyurids were sister
to spirurids, but with low posterior probability (0.83
BPP). This difference in position of the oxyurids, was
the most marked difference between the analyses of
complete data (nt or AA) versus nucleotide data excluding 3rd positions. An alternative tree topology test based
on ML and the dataset excluding 3rd positions showed
that the best ML tree constrained to require a sister
taxon relationship between oxyurids and spirurids was
significantly worse (S-H test, P < 0.05). This result confirms that there is a significant difference between inference methods (ML versus Bayesian) for the same
dataset (nt excluding 3rd positions) when considering
the position of oxyurids. Although one analysis (Bayesian AA; Figure 2) showed strong nodal support for
higher-level relationships involving oxyurids, a conservative interpretation is that additional investigations are
required to confirm the relationship of oxyurids among
Chromadorea based on mtDNA genomes. Phylogenetic
analyses of SSU sequences did not provide reliable support for the relationship of oxyurids to other nematode
taxa [10], suggesting that data from other loci may be
necessary to resolve this question.
Nematodes in the orders Ascaridida, Oxyurida, and
Spirurida are a major component of zooparasitic diversity. Evolutionary hypotheses and classification schemes
for these orders have differed substantially, depending
on the types of data considered and the taxonomic
authority. For example, Chitwood [36] and Maggenti
[37] both suggested that Ascaridida was more closely
related to Rhabditida than to Spirurida. Specifically,
Maggenti’s [38] classification placed special emphasis on
the morphology of the esophagus and life-history traits,
assigning the orders Rhabditida, Strongylida and Ascaridida under the subclass Rhabditia. In contrast, other
classifications emphasizing different features suggested a
sister-group relationship between Ascaridida and Spirurida [35,39], and proposed that members of this clade are
more closely related to Strongylida than to Oxyurida

Page 10 of 16

and Rhigonematida. In other work based on traditional
approaches, Inglis [40,41] proposed a sister-group relationship between Oxyurida and Strongylida, with Ascaridida and Spirurida belonging to a separate clade. These
hypotheses predate the understanding, inferred from
molecular phylogenetics [7,8], that the vertebrate parasites of the classical order Strongylida are phylogenetically nested within and closely related to free-living
Rhabditoidea. Phylum-wide phylogenies based on SSU
rDNA have indicated that representatives of the animalparasitic orders Ascaridida, Spirurida, Rhigonematida
and Oxyurida form a monophyletic group with strong
support (clade III sensu [7]; [10][42]), with the exception
of a single species in one study [10]. In contrast to this
overall monophyly for clade III taxa, an analysis of SSU
sequences for > 100 clade III species revealed that three
of the component orders (Ascaridida, Spirurida, and
Rhigonematida) each lacked monophyly for their
sampled species [10]. Finally, SSU data provide inconclusive resolution for relationships among most major
clade III lineages [10]. For clade III taxa, mitochondrial
genome data is inconsistent with clade III monophyly,
and instead depicts Ascaridida as nested within Rhabditida. The mitochondrial phylogenetic hypothesis conflicts with the evolutionary proposals by Inglis [40] and
Anderson [35,39], but is more consistent with the proposal of Maggenti [37,38] in that the Rhabditida, Strongylida, and Ascaridida are more closely related to each
other than any of these orders are to Spirurida. Maggenti [37] also treated oxyurids as a superfamily within
Ascaridida, but our mtDNA trees do not support a close
relationship between ascaridids and oxyurids. Previous
results based on substantially fewer mitochondrial genome sequences are consistent with the current conclusions based on broader taxon sampling, for example,
support for a sister-group relationship between Ascaridida and Rhabditida [20] and absence of monophyly for
representative clade III species [21]. In the context of
mtDNA phylogenetics, characterizing the relationships
among parasitic nematodes and understanding their
relationships to free-living species will require sampling
of many additional lineages, which is becoming feasible
with high-throughput sequencing methods. However,
the current mtDNA genome phylogeny is not consistent
with an evolutionary hypothesis suggesting two separate
origins of zooparasitism, one for Ascaridida and Spirurida and a separate origin for Oxyurida and Strongylida
(Strongyloidea) [41].
In general, the gene content of mitochondrial genomes
is invariant with few changes across a variety of metazoans. Based on the viewpoint that gene order is also
rather stable, and that gene rearrangements tend to
reflect common ancestry rather than convergent evolution, comparison of mitochondrial gene order pattern

closely related taxa [46]. In contrast, mitochondrial gene
order of chromadorean nematode species appears to be
more conserved, and shared gene arrangement between
the taxa has been interpreted as a reliable indicator of
their phylogenetic affinity [20,21]. Considering the phylogenetic framework provided by analysis of mtDNA
genome sequences, a highly conserved gene order is
found among most members within the Ascaridida
+Rhabditida clade. For C. robustus, the newly determined genome sequence has a gene arrangement that is
almost identical to those of most Ascaridida and Rhabditida, with only a few translocations of some tRNAs
(trnA, trnV, trnN and trnP) (Figure 5). The notable

has often been suggested as a potential tool for resolving
deep phylogenetic relationships [43-45]. Yet, these
assumptions have been called into question as more
mitochondrial genome data has been obtained. There is
a growing body of evidence that extensive gene rearrangements have occurred within some metazoan groups
including enoplean nematodes [46], mollusks [47,48],
tunicates [49], and some crustacean arthropods [50].
Such exceptions challenge the utility of gene order for
inferring deep branch phylogeny. In this context, comparison of gene order does not appear useful for evaluating relationships among enoplean nematodes because
extensive gene rearrangement is known even among

clades, including three species newly determined in this study. Gene and genome size are not to scale. All genes are transcribed in the
same direction (from left to right). The tRNAs are designated by single-letter abbreviation and two leucine and two serine tRNA genes are
labeled, according to their anticodon sequence, as L1 (trnL-uag), L2 (trnL-uaa), S1 (trnS-ucu), and S2 (trnS-uga), respectively.

exceptions to highly conserved gene arrangement within
the Ascaridida+Rhabditida clade are found in Strongyloides stercoralis and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora
whose gene arrangements differ substantially from all
other members of the clade reported thus far; the former species is the only representative of Strongyloidoidea in the analysis, and S. stercoralis is consistently
placed as the sister lineage to the other Ascaridida
+Rhabditida. Gene arrangement among the species
sampled within each of the orders Oxyurida and Spirurida is very similar and translocations within each order
are very limited (Figure 5). For example, there is a single
translocation or reciprocal translocation of a tRNA in
Oxyurida (trnI between Enterobius vermicularis and
Wellcomia siamensis) and reciprocal translocations of
trnV and trnM between Heliconema longissimum and
Dirofilaria immitis-Brugia malayi-Setaria digitata (Spirurida), and a single translocation of trnK between Onchocerca volvulus and Dirofilaria immitis-Brugia malayiSetaria digitata (Spirurida). Despite the similarity within
most orders (excepting Rhabditida), notable differences
in gene arrangement pattern are found among different
orders, particularly between Oxyurida and Spirurida
and/or between Spirurida and most Ascaridida and
Rhabditida members. Although the gene arrangement of
oxyurid members sequenced to date is unique, there are
some partial gene order identities (nad1-atp6, trnL2trnS1-nad2, trnR-trnQ, trnT-nad4, and nad3-nad5)
shared among most members of Rhabditida, Ascaridida
and Oxyurida (Figure 5). In contrast, these identities are
not shared with Spirurida species. Although interpretation of gene order patterns would benefit from formal
phylogenetic analysis of these data, this has not yet been
performed because additional sampling of more chromadorean groups is needed, particularly since the high
variability in gene order among enopleans complicates
their utility for rooting the chromadorean tree. Nevertheless, shared gene arrangement patterns appear to
provide additional support for the hypothesis that Spirurida are not closely related to Oxyurida and Ascaridida,
and that the latter two groups (especially Ascaridida)
share a more recent common ancestor with Rhabditida.
Neither mitochondrial genome phylogenies nor gene
arrangement patterns support the hypothesis that clade
III nematodes (sensu [7]) share a most recent common
ancestor reflecting a single origin.

Conclusion
In this study, we tested phylogenetic relationships of
nematodes using complete mitochondrial genome
information, with special emphasis on species from
clade III, which includes major components of zooparasitic nematode diversity. For this study, we determined the complete mitochondrial genome sequences

Page 12 of 16

of three nematode species, Cucullanus robustus
(13,972 bp) from Ascaridida, Heliconema longissimum
(13,610 bp) from Spirurida, and Wellcomia siamensis
(14,128 bp) from Oxyurida, and used sequences from
the protein coding genes to investigate phylogenetic
relationships, focusing on chromadorean orders. Phylogenetic analysis of these new mitochondrial genomes
corroborates the close relationship between Ascaridida
and Rhabditida and confirms that Ascaridida is nested
within Rhabditida. The Oxyurida and Spirurida are
each monophyletic, and are sister groups to the Ascaridida plus Rhabditida clade. This lack of monophyly for
clade III, as inferred from mtDNA genomes, conflicts
with phylogenetic trees based on nuclear rDNA. These
mtDNA hypotheses suggest that zooparasitic nematodes represented by Ascaridida, Oxyurida and Spirurida do not share a most recent common ancestor.
Ultimately, resolution of this and other conflicts
between nuclear rDNA gene trees and mtDNA gene
trees will require hypotheses based on additional independent loci. However, regions of topological concordance between mtDNA and nuclear rDNA
phylogenetic hypothesis indicate that continued efforts
to obtain complete mitochondrial genomes for unrepresented nematode lineages will prove useful for
understanding the evolution of mtDNA genomes and
developing phylogenetic hypotheses for the phylum
Nematoda.

Methods
Sample collection and molecular techniques

Nematode specimens were isolated from their host animals (C. robustus from the conger eel Conger myriaster,
H. longissimum from the Japanese eel Anguilla japonica,
and W. siamensis from the Malayan porcupine Hystrix
brachyura) and kept in 70% ethanol until they were
used for total genomic DNA extraction. Total genomic
DNA was extracted using a commercial kit (Qiagen Co.)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Partial fragments from different regions of the mitochondrial genome were initially amplified and directly sequenced
using universal primer combinations or primer sets
designed directly from the conserved regions of nematode mitochondrial gene sequences ([51]; see Additional
file 4 for primer details). Partial fragments of cox1, rrnS
and rrnL were amplified for C. robustus; partial fragments of rrnS, rrnL, cob and nad4 were amplified for H.
longissimum, and partial fragments of rrnS, rrnL, cox1
and nad4 were amplified for W. siamensis. PCR reactions were carried out in a 50 μl reaction volume consisting of 10 units of Taq polymerase (Roche), 2.5 mM
dNTP mixture, 2.5 mM MgCl2, and 20 pmole of each
primer with the following amplification conditions: one
cycle of the initial denaturation step at 95°C for 2 min,

Park et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:392
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/392

followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 30 s,
primer annealing at 43~48°C for 30 s and elongation at
72°C for 1 min. The final step was extension at 72°C for
10 min.
The nucleotide sequences obtained from each of these
gene fragments were then used to design species-specific
primer sets for long PCR reactions. These overlapping
long PCR products (ranging from ~1.5 kb to 8 kb in
size), covering the entire mitochondrial genome, were
amplified using the long PCR primer sets (Additional
file 4) and the Expand Long Template PCR System
(Roche) with the following amplification conditions: 1
cycle of initial denaturation (2 min at 93°C), 30 cycles of
denaturation - primer annealing - elongation (15 s at
93°C, 30 s at 50~60°C, and 10 min at 68°C), and 1 cycle
of the final extension (10 min at 68°C). The amplified
long PCR products were gel-isolated, and extracted
using the TOPO Gel Purification reagents supplied with
the TOPO XL cloning kit (Invitrogen Co.). After gel
purification, each of the long PCR products was ligated
using the TOPO XL cloning kit and then transformed
into competent E. coli. Cycle sequencing reactions for
each of the long PCR products were performed in both
directions by the ‘primer walking’ method using a Big
Dye Terminator Cycle-Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems). A complete strand of the entire mtDNA sequence
from each of the three species was then assembled by
double-checking the sequences of overlapping regions of
the long PCR fragments and partial sequences obtained
from separate gene fragments.
Gene annotation and phylogenetic analyses

Twelve mitochondrial protein-coding genes and two
ribosomal RNA genes of each species were identified by
finding gene boundaries based on comparison with
other nematode mitochondrial DNA sequences. Putative
secondary structures of 22 tRNA genes from each of the
three mtDNAs were identified using the tRNAscan-SE
program [52] or by manually finding potential secondary
structures and anticodon sequences. Thirty-six complete
nematode mitochondrial genomes including three newly
sequenced in the present study were used for phylogenetic analysis with two arthropod species (Lithobius forficatus and Limulus polyphemus) as outgroups. A
complete list of species, their taxonomy and GenBank
accession numbers are provided in Additional file 5. For
phylogenetic analysis, both nucleotide and amino acid
sequence datasets from the 12 protein-coding genes
were used. For multiple alignment of amino acid
sequences, the nucleotide sequences of each of 12 protein-coding genes were first translated into amino acids
using the invertebrate mitochondrial genetic code. The
resulting amino acid sequences were then aligned for
each gene using Clustal × with default options [53]. The

Page 13 of 16

nucleotide sequences of the 12 protein-coding genes
were aligned based on the framework of their corresponding amino acid alignment using RevTrans, a webbased program for placing gaps in coding DNA based
on amino acid alignments [54]. Alignments of individual
genes were concatenated for phylogenetic analysis. A
nucleotide dataset excluding 3rd positions of codons was
also constructed. Phylogenetic analyses for the concatenated datasets (full nucleotide, nucleotide excluding 3rd
positions, amino acids) were performed using two different tree-building methods. Bayesian inference was used
for the amino acid dataset and conducted using the
codon model for MrBayes version 3.1.2 [55]. MrBayes
was run using four MCMC chains for 106 generations,
and sampled every 1,000 generations. Each of the 12
genes was treated as a separate unlinked data partition.
For the amino acid dataset, Bayesian posterior probability (BPP) values were determined after discarding the
initial 200 trees (the first 2 × 105 generations) as burnin. With the nucleotide dataset excluding 3rd positions,
each of the 12 genes was treated as a separate unlinked
data partition. MrBayes was executed on the Cipres Portal for the nucleotide datasets and using four MCMC
chains for 4 × 106 generations, sampled every 4,000 generations. Bayesian posterior probability (BPP) values
were determined after discarding the initial one-third of
trees as burn-in. Maximum likelihood analysis was used
for the two nucleotide datasets and conducted using
RAxML 7.0.3 [56] and the CIPRES web portal. For
RAxML, each of the 12 genes was treated as a separate
partition (with gamma rate heterogeneity and all gamma
model parameters estimated for each partition by the
program). Bootstrap ML analysis was performed using
the rapid bootstrapping method (RAxML) with 1,000
replicates. Statistical tests for comparing alternative phylogenetic hypotheses were performed using both the
complete nucleotide dataset and the dataset excluding
3rd positions of codons; alternative trees were evaluated
using the likelihood-based Shimodaira-Hasegawa test
[57] as implemented in RAxML 7.0.3. Alternative trees
for comparison were found based on RAxML searches
(with gene partitions as detailed previously), but with
the tree topology constrained to reflect the alternative
hypothesis of choice (e.g., constrained for clade III
monophyly).
The best ML tree recovered for the complete nt dataset constrained for clade III monophyly was: [((Lithobius
