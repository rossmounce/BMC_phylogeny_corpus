Abstract
Background: Various expansions or contractions of inverted repeats (IRs) in chloroplast
genomes led to fluxes in the IR-LSC (large single copy) junctions. Previous studies revealed that
some monocot IRs contain a trnH-rps19 gene cluster, and it has been speculated that this may be
an evidence of a duplication event prior to the divergence of monocot lineages. Therefore, we
compared the organizations of genes flanking two IR-LSC junctions in 123 angiosperm
representatives to uncover the evolutionary dynamics of IR-LSC junctions in basal angiosperms and
monocots.
Results: The organizations of genes flanking IR-LSC junctions in angiosperms can be classified into
three types. Generally each IR of monocots contains a trnH-rps19 gene cluster near the IR-LSC
junctions, which differs from those in non-monocot angiosperms. Moreover, IRs expanded more
progressively in monocots than in non-monocot angiosperms. IR-LSC junctions commonly
occurred at polyA tract or A-rich regions in angiosperms. Our RT-PCR assays indicate that in
monocot IRA the trnH-rps19 gene cluster is regulated by two opposing promoters, S10A and psbA.
Conclusion: Two hypotheses are proposed to account for the evolution of IR expansions in
monocots. Based on our observations, the inclusion of a trnH-rps19 cluster in majority of monocot
IRs could be reasonably explained by the hypothesis that a DSB event first occurred at IRB and led
to the expansion of IRs to trnH, followed by a successive DSB event within IRA and lead to the
expansion of IRs to rps19 or to rpl22 so far. This implies that the duplication of trnH-rps19 gene
cluster was prior to the diversification of extant monocot lineages. The duplicated trnH genes in
the IRB of most monocots and non-monocot angiosperms have distinct fates, which are likely
regulated by different expression levels of S10A and S10B promoters. Further study is needed to
unravel the evolutionary significance of IR expansion in more recently diverged monocots.

Background
Typically the cpDNAs of land plants contain two identical

segments, the inverted repeats (IRs: IRA and IRB), separated by two single copy (SC) sequences, the large single

copy (LSC) region and the small single copy (SSC) region
[1,2]. Thus four junctions, termed JLA, JSA, JSB, JLB, are
between the two IRs and the SC regions [3,4]. A major
constraint on cpDNA is its organization into large clusters
of polycistronically transcribed genes [5-7]. As a result,
large structural changes in cpDNA, such as segmental
duplication or deletion and mutation in gene order, are
relatively rare and evolutionarily useful in making phylogenetic inferences [8].
In land plants, the sizes of rRNA gene-containing IRs are
notably variable, ranging from 10 kb in liverworts to
20–25 kb in most angiosperms [2,9,10], and up to 76 kb
in Pelargonium (a eudicot) [11]. Successive IR expansions,
either within angiosperms or between non-vascular plants
and angiosperms, have led to floating of JLA and JLB [12]
and have evolutionary significance [13-15]. Several models concerning the expansion and contraction of IR
regions have been proposed to explain the possible mechanisms that result in shift of the IR-LSC junctions. For
example, the unusual triple-sized expansion of the Geranium IR was hypothesized as an outcome of inversion due
to recombination between homologous dispersed repeats
[16]. Similarly, the at least 4 kb expansion of the IR in
buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) cpDNA was also considered to be associated with an inversion [17].
Goulding et al. [15] found that in most Nicotiana species
IR regions have both expanded and contracted with slight
variations in length during the evolution of the genus. The
exception is N. acuminata, which underwent a large IR
expansion of over 12 kb. Goulding et al. [15] proposed
two mechanisms of IR expansion: (i) gene conversion to
account for the small IR expansion or movements in most
species of the genus, and (ii) a DNA double-strand break
(DSB) to explain the extensive incorporation of the LSC
region into the IR of N. acuminata. Perry et al. [18] analyzed the endpoint sequence of a large 78 kb rearrangement in adzuki bean (Vigna angularis) and concluded that
the unusual organization was caused by a two-step process of expansion and contraction of the IR, rather than a
large inversion.

dynamics at the IR-LSC junctions of cpDNAs in basal
angiosperms and monocots as a whole. Goulding et al.
[15] found that each IR in rice and maize (Poaceae) contains a fully duplicated trnH-rps19 gene cluster. Chang et
al. [20] further discovered that the IRs of two other remote
monocot taxa, Acorus and Orchidaceae, also include trnH
and rps19 (although the 3' region of rps19 was truncated
in Acorus), and speculated that the clustering of rps19 and
trnH was probably duplicated before the diversification of
extant monocot lineages.
As a result of expansion and contraction, the IRs in the
cpDNA of angiosperms have been suggested as an evolutionary marker for elucidating relationships among some
taxa [14,28]. To improve understanding of the dynamics
and evolution of IR-LSC junctions from basal
angiosperms to the emergence and diversification of
monocots (assuming that this evolutionary course is correct), we sampled 52 key species and determined the
sequences of the two regions spanning JLA (Fig. 1, between
the 3' end of rpl2 and the 5' end of psbA) and JLB (Fig. 1,
between the 3' end of rpl2 and the 5' end of rpl22). A total
of 123 representative angiosperms, including 12 basal
angiosperms, 16 magnoliids, 62 eudicots, and 33 monocots (see the additional file 1), were analyzed. Three types
of gene arrangements flanking the JLA and JLB regions were
recognized and mapped onto the angiosperm phylogeny.
In order to explain this arrangements we propose two
alternative hypotheses concerning the evolutionary history of the flux of IR-LSC. Furthermore, to verify the transcriptional status of the duplicated trnH-rps19 gene cluster
near the IRA junctions the activity of two operons in Asparagus densiflorus, S10A and psbA, was investigated.

Results

Recent phylogenetic studies using various molecular
markers have yielded robust support for the hypothesis of
either Amborella alone or Amborella-Nymphaeales together
as the basal-most clade of angiosperms [13,19-26], and
the genus Acorus has been identified as the earliest splitting lineage in monocots. However, the sister group of
monocots is still unclear [26].

Several terms used in this section are briefly explained
here. Types of IR-LSC junction are based on the organization of genes flanking JLB and JLA in angiosperms. Type I is
found in most non-monocot angiosperm dicots. It refers
to an intact trnH gene being located directly downstream
of the rpl2 sequence in IRA and an intact rps19 gene being
located directly downstream of the rpl2 sequence in IRB.
No full-length rps19 or trnH sequence is present in IRA or
IRB respectively. Type II refers to a partial sequence of
rps19 being located directly between rpl2 and trnH in IRA.
Type II pattern is only found in some eudicots while type
III characterizes the IRs of most monocots, in which each
IR contains a trnH-rps19 cluster. The letters a, a', c, ... and
g used in the text and in Figure 1 refer to the IR-LSC junctions found in cpDNAs of sampled angiosperms.

Monocots include about one-fourth of the world's flowering plants and represent one of the oldest angiosperm lineages [27]. However, no comparative study has been
conducted to investigate the diversity and evolutionary

In non-monocot angiosperms IR-LSC junctions of IRB are
largely located between rpl2 and rps19

(data shown in the additional file 1). In these cases, designated as type I, an intact trnH gene is always present near
the JLA but absent from the JLB. In Chloranthus oldhami, C.
spicatus, Sarcandra glabra (Chloranthales), Canella winterana (Canellales), Ranunculus japonica and R. macranthus
(eudicot), a partial trnH sequence is found extending to
position c in IRB (Fig. 1A, additional file 1). The IR-LSC
junctions were located upstream of position c' (i.e.
upstream of trnH) in Nuphar advena (Nymphaeaceae) and
Elaeagnus formosana (Elaeagnaceae, eudicot), at position a
in Kadsura japonica (Schisandraceae, Austrobaileyales),
and at position a' in Calycanthus fertilis and C. floridus
(Calycanthaceae, Laurales, [29,30]) (Fig. 1A). However,
Vitis vinifera (Vitaceae, eudicot) showed a complete loss of
rpl2 near JLA [31].
The Winteraceae (Canellales), exemplified by Zygogynum
pauciflorum and Drimys granadensis [29], were exceptional
in that the organization of the genes flanking the IR-LSC
junctions resembled the one found in most monocots,
rather than the organization seen in other non-monocot
angiosperms. Notably, each of their IRs contained a trnHrps19 cluster and their IR-LSC junctions were located
within the 5' portion of rps19 (position d, Fig. 1).
Type II IR-LSC junctions were found in Schisandra arisanensis (Schisandraceae; Austrobaileyales) and some 41 representative eudicots (Fig. 1A; additional file 1). Unlike
type I, the JLA of type II shifted to the 5' end of the truncated rps19 in IRA (position e and e', Fig. 1A, additional
file 1).
IRs of monocots generally contain trnH-rps19 clusters
In contrast to basal angiosperms and eudicots, most
monocots (Fig. 1B) had trnH-rps19 clusters present in
each of the two IRs, and the IR-LSC junctions were generally at position f (Arecales, Dasypogonaceae, Asparagus
densiflorus [Liliales], Poales and Zingiberales) or g (in
Asparagales and Commelinales) (Fig. 1B). This type of
gene organization was classified as type III. In addition,
IR-LSC junctions of some monocots were located downstream of rpl2 (position b; in Araceae, most Alismataceae,
and Hydrocharitaceae), of trnH (position c' in Potamogetonaceae and Dioscoreaceae), or within rps19 (position d,
Fig. 1; in Acorales, Lilium formosamum [Liliales] and Panadanales). When the IR-LSC junction was at position d,
the rps19 sequence in IRA was found to be partially truncated most of the times.
Sequences flanking IR-LSC junctions are more variable in
monocots than in non-monocot angiosperms
Figure 2 illustrates alignment of the sequences flanking
the JLA regions in some representatives of basal
angiosperms and eudicots (A) and monocots (B). Of particular interest is the observation that the IR-LSC junctions

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/36

of basal angiosperms, eudicots and monocots are commonly found at either polyA tract or A-rich regions (Fig.
2). We also found that the dicot IR sequences near the IRLSC junctions varied little and could be aligned among
orders having the same or different IR-LSC junction types,
while in monocots the corresponding regions were very
different and difficult to align across different orders (Fig.
2B). Moreover, within the sampled angiosperm families
the sequences flanking the JLAregions were very similar.
Transcription of monocot trnH-rps19 of IRA is regulated
by both chloroplast S10A and psbA promoters
Among the chloroplast operons, the S10 ribosomal protein operon is the largest. It contains genes encoding both
small (rps) and large (rpl) ribosomal protein subunits that
are organized into a polycistronic transcription unit conserved in known cpDNAs [32]. In angiosperms, the 5' end
of the S10 operon is initiated within the IR, but only in IRB
does the operon extend into the LSC region, and the S10
operon is only partially in IRA (viz. the S10A operon).
However, a second operon in IRA, the psbA operon, is transcribed from LSC towards IRA [32] and opposite to the
S10A operon.

In the Winteraceae and a majority of monocots, the trnHrps19 cluster of IRA is included in both the S10 and psbA
operons. Therefore, this gene cluster may be regulated by
two opposing promoters, the S10A and the psbA (Fig. 3A).
In monocots, if the trnH in IRA is indeed regulated by the
above-mentioned two opposing promoters, the function
of the trnH gene may be repressed because antisense-trnH
RNAs would be generated by both the S10A and S10B promoters. To verify this possibility, we conducted RT-PCR
assays using specific primers for a type III representative,
Asparagus densiflorus, with the IR-LSC junction located at
position f (Fig. 1B).
Our results indicate that expression of the trnH gene in IRA
is regulated by both the S10A and psbA promoters. This
suggests that the duplicated trnH gene located in the IRB
region of most monocots and in some non-monocots has
different fates (i.e. functional or degenerate in different
lineages; see Fig. 1). Figure 3B shows that two RT-PCR
products, a 250 bp and a 700 bp fragment, respectively,
were generated when specific primer pairs for each were
used (Fig. 3A). The former fragment was amplified from
the transcripts made by the psbA promoter, and the latter
by the S10 promoter. This result confirms that the trnHrps19 cluster of IRA is regulated by two opposing promoters (Fig. 3B), indicating that the transcription machinery
in IRs of monocots may differ from that of basal
angiosperms and eudicots.

Discussion
Two evolutionary hypotheses for the flux of IR-LSC
junctions in monocots
As shown in Figure 1A, IR-LSC junctions of the Amborella
+ Nymphaeales are mainly located at position b, but junctions of monocots are further expanded to encompass
LSC genes and are located at positions f or g. Since the two
IRs of monocots usually include the trnH-rps19 cluster
(position f or g, further downstream of rpl2; Fig. 1B), we
hypothesize that at least two duplication events are
required to explain the expansion of IRs in monocots during the course of IR evolution from an Amborella-like
ancestor to present-day monocots. If this hypothesis is
correct, it is expected that an intermediate junction type
could be traceable in the cpDNAs of some early divergent
monocot lineages between the two duplication events.

Narayanan et al. [33] have recently presented a model of
gene amplification in eukaryotes that argues strongly for
the involvement of hairpin-capped DSBs in the initiation.

Based on this model and our observations, we propose
two hypotheses to account for the evolution of IR expansions in monocots (Fig. 4). In hypothesis A, a DSB event
(Fig. 4, red arrowhead in step 1) occurs first within the IRB
of an Amborella-like ancestor, and then the free 3' end of
the broken strand is repaired against the homologous
sequence in IRA. The repaired sequence extends over the
original IR-LSC junction and reaches the area downstream
of trnH (Fig. 4, step 1), so that duplication of a trnH gene
in the newly repaired IRB is achieved. Similarly, a second
DSB event occurs in IRA adjacent to the IRA-LSC junction
(Fig. 4, red arrowhead at step 2) so that duplication of
rps19 at IRA can be initiated, and a trnH-rps19 cluster
nearby JLB (Fig. 4, step 2) is created. The newly formed IRs
might cover the trnH-rps19 cluster and extend further into
the intergenic spacer between rps19 and rpl22 (Fig. 4, step
1 to step 2). Furthermore, if one additional DSB event
took place within the intergenic spacer located between
rps19 and rpl22 in the LSC region, a partial rpl22 gene
would be duplicated at IRA using the rpl22 sequence of

LSC as a template, and from then on the repaired IRs
might have expanded towards the 5' region of the rpl22
(Fig. 4, step 2 to step 3). The exceptionally long IRs
observed in the Orchidaceae and Commelinales are likely
to have been generated by this process. The same outcomes could also result if the process proceeded directly
from step 1 to step 3 without step 2 (Fig. 4, path indicated
by green dashed arrow).

Hypothesis B, on the other hand, assumes that rps19
would be duplicated or converted prior to the duplication
of trnH through a DSB event that takes place at IRA first
(Fig. 4; blue arrowhead of step 1). A second DSB event
(Fig. 4; blue arrowhead of step 2) then would take place
within the IRB region through a similar repair process to
the one mentioned before, so that a duplicated trnH is
generated at IRB. Finally, the IRs expand downstream of

Two hypotheses for the evolutionary derivation of the trnH-rps19 cluster in IRs of monocots from an Amborella-like ancestor
Figure 4
Two hypotheses for the evolutionary derivation of the trnH-rps19 cluster in IRs of monocots from an Amborella-like ancestor.
Arrow lines coded by different colors indicate distinct evolutionary pathways. Arrowheads denote possible breakpoints when
DSB events occurred (different DSB colors are associated with different IR expansions). The light blue arrow line refers to a
scenario in which a type II IR-LSC junction was established (see Fig. 1) in some eudicots (note that the rps19 residue is situated
between rpl2 and trnH in IRA). The grey area in each cpDNA molecule highlights the IRs at all evolutionary stages.

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:36

rps19. In hypothesis B subsequent extension of IRs is
assumed to resemble step 3 of hypothesis A.
Duplication of a partial or complete rps19 gene was also
observed in some eudicots and Schisandraceae (type II)
with their respective IR-LSC junctions located at position
e or e' (additional file 1; Fig. 1). However, these duplicated rps19 genes (both partial and complete) are situated
between the rpl2 and trnH genes of the IRA (refer to type II
in Fig. 1A and Fig. 4 [see the light blue line at the right side
leading to eudicots]) rather than downstream of trnH or
upstream of psbA (refer to step (2) and (3) of hypothesis
A in Figure 4). Therefore, the gene arrangement flanking
the IRA-LSC of type II deviates from that of type I, suggesting that duplication of rps19 genes in type II must have a
distinct evolutionary history.
Based on comparisons of aligned rpl2-trnH and trnH-rps19
intergenic spacer sequences from representatives of major
monocot orders (Figure 5A, B), it is apparent that these
two spacer sequences are separately highly similar across
the sampled monocot orders. These data give strong support to hypothesis A that in monocots expansion and
inclusion of trnH-rps19 gene cluster in IRs might require at

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/36

least two common DSBs (please refer to steps 1 to 3 of
hypothesis A in Figure 4): one occurring within IRB (refer
to Fig. 4, step 1), and the within IRA (refer to Fig, 4 step 2
or 3).
However, we did not discover any inverted repeats that
might have led to the formation of hairpins in the monocot intergenic spacers of trnH and rps19. Therefore, we are
inclined to conclude that the expansions of monocot IRs
took the path depicted in hypothesis A.
IR expansion may be initiated by DSB and end in the
nearby polyA region in angiosperms
Goulding et al. [15] proposed two models to account for
two kinds of IR expansion: (1) small and random IR
expansions, caused by gene conversion (viz. single strand
break); and (2) large IR expansions, like those found in
the Nicotiana species, rice and maize, generated via DSB
events. Narayanan et al. [33] further demonstrated that
DSBs can trigger gene amplification through a variety of
mechanisms, and that breakage at the inverted repeats of
chromosomes can cause gene amplification.

After a critical comparison of genes or sequences adjacent
to the IR-LSC junctions in 33 major orders and 8 families
of angiosperms (following the classification system proposed by Soltis et al. 2005 [27]), we hypothesize that IR
expansions resulted principally from the DSB events that
occurred during IR evolution from the Amborella-like
ancestor to monocots. This hypothesis is founded on the
following 5 observations: (1) the length of IR expansion
from basal angiosperms to monocots is large (more than
100 bp); (2) trnH and rps19 are situated downstream of
IRA and IRB, respectively, in all sampled basal angiosperms
(Fig. 1A). This type of gene arrangement might represent
the ancestral gene pattern in basal angiosperms; (3) IRs of
several basal angiosperms (e.g. Schisandraceae, Chloranthales and Magnoliales, Winteraceae) and eudicots (Fig.
1A) have partially or completely duplicated trnH genes
located at IRB; (4) in comparison with other angiosperms,
monocot IRs have expanded further to include a duplicated rps19 in IRA, and this expansion should have
occurred before the diversification of major monocot
orders; and (5) the IRs of advanced monocots (from
Asparagales to Poales) have expanded to encompass more
LSC sequences or genes (Fig. 1B). Nevertheless, the latter
expansions did not apparently result from another common DSB event but from independent ones, because
among sampled monocot orders the downstream regions
of rps19 genes have low sequence similarity (Fig. 2). At the
infra-order level of angiosperms, gene conversion might
occur frequently at meiosis and cause small IR expansion
or contraction during evolution, as found in Apiaceae [14]
and Nicotiana [15].
Studies on the IR-LSC junctions of Nicotiana species [15]
and Apiaceous plants [14] have indicated that short
repeats or "polyA tract" sequences associated with tRNAs
at the IR-LSC boundaries might be likely hotspots for
recombination. We also observed that polyA tract
sequences are commonly present near the IR-LSC junctions in all the basal angiosperms, eudicots and monocots
examined (Fig. 2), indicating that such sequences are
closely linked with the dynamics of IR-LSC junctions and
expansion of IRs. In this regard, we further propose that IR
expansion may initiate at the DSBs and finish at the polyA
tract regions, where recombination may actively occur,
and that the recombination mechanism in cpDNA may
resemble that reported for nuclear genomes by Narayanan
et al. [33].
According to our hypothesis, DSBs within IRs must have
been frequent during angiosperm evolution. However,
only those which led to successful IR expansions, and
have subsequently been retained in the extant taxa, are
detectable. Based on our observations, it is evident that
the type of IR-LSC junction appears to be informative, at

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/36

least at the level of order, and is therefore useful for inferring phylogenetic relationships at this rank and above.
Expansion of monocot IRs is correlated with the
divergence pattern of monocot phylogeny
As shown in Figure 1B, IR-LSC junctions of basal monocots including Acorales, Pandanales and Liliales are usually located at position d. This type might represent a
primitive state. In contrast, IR-LSC junctions of the
derived monocots, such as Asparagales and Poales, have
generally expanded to position f or g. This trend in IR
expansion seems to correlate well with the divergence pattern of monocot lineages in the multigene tree of Soltis et
al. [27,34], which shows Acorales to be a sister group to
other monocots. This correlation connotes the ancient
status of the order and the continuous IR expansion experienced by the more terminal and derived lineages, viz.
Asparagales, Commelinales, Zingiberales, Arecales, Dasypogonaceae and Poales.

It is worth mentioning that in some monocots (e.g. Pandanales and Liliales) the IR-LSC junctions are located at
position d, with a truncated rps19 gene at IRA. According
to hypothesis A (Fig. 4), duplication of rps19 at IRA was
due to a second DSB event in IRA (Fig. 4, red arrowhead at
step 2), followed by a sequence repair supposed to have
been terminated within or downstream of the rps19 gene.
Duplication of the rps19 gene will lead to a shift of the IRLSC junction to position d or f (Fig. 1B). However, in Pandanales and Liliales, the rps19 sequences of IRA are incomplete or degraded. We considered these common
degradations likely to be secondary rather than primary,
since the majority of monocot orders have the trnH-rps19
clusters (Fig. 1B). Moreover, among the major monocot
orders (except Alismatales) the intergenic spacer
sequences within the trnH-rps19 cluster (Fig. 5B) have a
high degree of similarity, suggesting that among the sampled monocots a common DSB event might have taken
place adjacent to the trnH gene. Therefore, the IRs in Acorales, Pandanales and Liliales are likely to have contracted,
causing a shift of the IR-LSC junctions from around position f to position d.
A comparison of the downstream non-coding or spacer
sequences of the rps19 genes in monocots reveals that the
sequences do not have a common origin (Fig. 2B), as they
are highly variable and a reliable sequence alignment is
impossible except between closely related con-ordinal
taxa (e.g. Zingiberales and Asparagales). This indicates
that these spacer sequences had diverse origins and are
likely to have resulted from independent DSB events
occurring at different points within the IRs.
In contrast, it appears that expansion of IR-LSC junctions
did not parallel the evolutionary diversification of basal

angiosperms and eudicot lineages (Fig. 1A). In type I (Fig.
1), IR expansion downstream of rps19 is extremely rare in
eudicots, with the exception of Adzuki bean (Perry et al.
[18]) and a Pelargonium species (Palmer et al. [16], Chumley et al. [11]). According to our hypothesis A (Fig. 4), the
scenario of IR expansion in these two eudicots may have
different origins from those of monocots and other eudicots (i.e. type II, Fig. 1), with IRs that have expanded
downstream of rps19 genes. Similarly, significant IR contractions in the basal angiosperm Illicium oligandrum
(about 1 kb), coriander (4 kb) [13,14], and Cuscuta reflexa
(about 700 bp to 8 kb) [35] seem to be separate events in
their respective lineages.
Implications of sequences flanking IR-LSC junctions for
angiosperm phylogeny
In extant angiosperms, the relationships among the
remaining 5 lineages (magnoliids, monocots, eudicots,
Chloranthaceae and Ceratophyllum) are unresolved
[19,26,27]. To what extent the dicot lineage is a sister
group of monocots remains uncertain, probably a reflection of the rapid radiation and extinction of early
angiosperms soon after they originated [36,37].

Recent phylogenetic analyses based on plastid sequence
data have suggested that monocots and eudicots are sister
taxa (Graham et al. [38] and Cai et al. [39]), but with low
bootstrap support (67% and 72%, respectively). In addition, several lines of evidence have indicated that Ceratophyllaceae could be the sister group of monocots [40-44].
Here we present an alternative view on this issue. As illustrated in Figure 1, an intact trnH is duplicated in IRB of all
monocots, one basal angiosperm (Nuphar advena, position c'), and two winteraceous magnoliid species (Zygogynum paucifolum and Drimys granadensis, position d) [29].
Sequence comparison revealed that only Winteraceae and
monocots have highly similar spacer sequences between
the rpl2 and trnH genes (Fig. 5B), suggesting that duplication of trnH gene in IRB of the two taxa might be common
or similar (viz. convergent). On the other hand, Acorales
(the most basal lineage in monocots, [27]) has its IR endpoint at position d, suggesting that those lineages with IRLSC junctions at position b and c' (most Alismatales and
Dioscoreales) might have resulted from separate, independent contractions. Our alternative view on the relationships among monocots and their relatives is
preliminary, as it is only based on comparison of genic
organizations at IR-LSC junctions. Additional molecular
and morphological data are required to improve our
understanding of monocot phylogeny.

The presence of two anti-sense strands of trnH in monocot
IRs is mysterious
The presence of a trnH-rps19 cluster in the IRs appears to
be a common feature in monocots other than some Alismatids (additional file 1, Fig. 1), in which IR-LSC junctions are located at position b and strongly resemble those
of most non-monocot angiosperms. However, alignment
of the intergenic spacers between rpl2 and trnH in some
Alismatales (e.g. Alocasia odora) and other monocots,
basal angiosperms and eudicots (Fig. 5) reveals that
sequences of the Alismatids are more similar to other
monocots than to non-monocot angiosperms. This
implies that IR expansions in some Alismatids might
share evolutionary scenarios similar to those proposed for
other monocots, and that the short IRs (or IR contraction)
in some other Alismatids are likely due to either an early
termination of the repair-extension reaction after the first
DSB in step 1 of hypothesis A (Fig. 4), or to a contraction
after this step.

In monocots, each IR usually contains a trnH gene, while
in most basal angiosperms and eudicots the gene is rarely
present in IRB (see Fig. 1A: type I and type II). Why is the
duplicated trnH gene able to survive in IRB of most monocots but is absent, degraded or truncated in most nonmonocot angiosperms? In two studied eudicots, Lotus
japonicus [18] and Spinacea oleracea [45], the transcriptional activity of S10A dropped significantly because of
either the high transcription levels of the psbA and trnH
genes or the termination of S10A proximal to JLA [32].
Therefore, in non-monocot angiosperms, trnH-encoded
mRNA molecules constitute only one sense strand, transcribed solely by the psbA operon rather than by the S10A
operon. Because anti-sense RNA molecules may interfere
with the normal function of the sense RNA molecules
[32], in monocots the mechanism by which anti-sense
trnH is regulated by two S10A promoters is mysterious.
Further study on the evolution and survival of the duplicated trnH gene in IRB of monocots is desirable.

Conclusion
Extensive comparisons of the genic organizations flanking
the IR-LSC junctions in 123 diversified angiosperm lineages revealed that monocots and non-monocot
angiosperms generally have different IR-LSC junction
types. Notably, IRs expanded more progressively in
monocots than in non-monocot angiosperms, with more
LSC genes being converted into IRs. With the exceptions
of Alismatales and a few Acorales, the monocot IRA
regions either encompass a trnH-rps19 cluster or extend as
far as the 5' portion of the rpl22 gene, which is typically
situated at the LSC region in non-monocot angiosperms.
Various expansions of IRs in monocots have resulted in
corresponding fluxes of IR-LSC junctions. Our results further indicate that the IR expansions in angiosperms can be

explained by initiation of a DSB event and ending at a
polyA tract region.
We proposed two hypotheses to explain the evolutionary
derivation of the trnH-rps19 cluster in the IRs of monocots
from an Amborella-like ancestor (Fig. 4). Hypothesis A
proposes that a DSB event occurs first within the IRB of an
Amborella-like ancestor, and then the free 3' end of the
broken strand is repaired against the homologous
sequence in IRA. The repaired sequence extends and
results in the duplication of a trnH gene in the newly
repaired IRB. A subsequent DSB event may occur in IRA so
that the rps19 at IRA is duplicated, whereby a trnH-rps19
cluster is created. Hypothesis B assumes that rps19 is
duplicated or converted before the duplication of trnH via
a DSB event that occurs at IRA.
It is worth noting that IR expansions in monocots appear
to correlate well with the divergence pattern of monocot
phylogeny. The present study highlights the use of
sequences flanking the IR-LSC junctions to address the
evolutionary dynamics of IRs from basal angiosperms to
monocots. Taken together with the evidence from the IRLSC junctions, we conclude that (i) monocots may be
closely related to the Winteraceae (magnoliids) than to
other basal angiosperms or eudicots, (ii) the shorter IRs in
Alismatids are probably due to either an early termination
of repair-extension after the first DSB, or to a contraction
after this step, and (iii) the duplicated trnH genes in the
IRB of most monocots and non-monocot angiosperms
have distinct fates, which are likely regulated by different
expression levels of S10A and S10B promoters. Further
study is needed to unravel the evolutionary significance or
advantage of the presence of an additional trnH in monocot IRs, and of IR expansion in more recently diverged
monocots.

Methods
Plant materials and DNA preparation
Species sampled in this study were listed in the additional
file 1. Total cellular DNA was extracted using the method
of Saghai-Maroof et al. [46]. The extracted DNAs were
used directly for PCR amplification.
PCR amplification
Primer design was based on published sequence data for
conserved regions flanking the IR-LSC junctions. The JLA
regions were amplified with the primer pair rpl2-psbA-F3
and rpl2-psbA-R2, which correspond to the 3' end of rpl2
and the 5' end of psbA respectively (Fig. 1). The JLB region
was amplified using two forward primers, rps3-F1 and
rps3-F2, that respectively pair with a reverse primer rps3rpl2-R2. The sequences of these primers are listed in Table
1. Amplicons were cleaned using the Gel Extraction System (Viogene, Taipei) and cloned into a pGEM T-Easy vector (Promega, Fitchsburg). Plasmid DNAs were purified
using the Plasmid DNA Miniprep System (Viogene) and
sequenced on an ABI 3730 automated sequencer (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City). For each species two independent PCR clones were sequenced. Sequence alignments
were made using GeneDoc (Ver. 2.6.02.)
Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RTPCR) Assay
To verify the transcription of trnH-rps19 that flanks the IRA
region, total RNAs were extracted and purified by RNeasy®
Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden). The resulting RNAs were
reversely transcribed to synthesize cDNA with Superscript
II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Indianapolis) and a
specific primer (either trnH-psbA-F1 or trnH-rev), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The two synthesized
cDNAs were then used with the primer pair trnH-psbA-F1
and rpl2-psbA-R2 to amplify a 674 bp fragment, and the
primer pair trnH-rev and rpl2-psbA-F3 to amplify a 298 bp
fragment. Each of the two reactions was conducted under
