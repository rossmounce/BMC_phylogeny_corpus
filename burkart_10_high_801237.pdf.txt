Abstract
Background: Chaperones facilitate proper folding of peptides and bind to misfolded proteins as occurring during
periods of cell stress. Complexes of peptides with chaperones induce peptide-directed immunity. Here we analyzed
the interaction of (pre)proinsulin with the best characterized chaperone of the hsp70 family, bacterial DnaK.
Results: Of a set of overlapping 13-mer peptides of human preproinsulin high affinity binding to DnaK was found
for the signal peptide and one further region in each proinsulin domain (A- and B-chain, C-peptide). Among the
latter, peptides covering most of the B-chain region B11-23 exhibited strongest binding, which was in the range of
known high-affinity DnaK ligands, dissociation equilibrium constant (K’d) of 2.2 ± 0.4 μM. The B-chain region B11-23
is located at the interface between two insulin molecules and not accessible in insulin oligomers. Indeed, native
insulin oligomers showed very low DnaK affinity (K’d 67.8 ± 20.8 μM) whereas a proinsulin molecule modified to
prevent oligomerization showed good binding affinity (K’d 11.3 ± 7.8 μM).
Conclusions: Intact insulin only weakly interacts with the hsp70 chaperone DnaK whereas monomeric proinsulin
and peptides from 3 distinct proinsulin regions show substantial chaperone binding. Strongest binding was seen
for the B-chain peptide B 11-23. Interestingly, peptide B11-23 represents a dominant autoantigen in type 1
diabetes.

Background
Prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells employ chaperones for
guiding polypeptides during synthesis towards proper
folding, for preventing misfolded proteins from aggregating, for re-establishing proper conformation or channeling misfolded polypeptides towards intracellular
degradation. Under conditions of cell stress, such as
heat stress or a high rate of protein synthesis, there is a
higher amount of polypeptides misfolded, and in parallel
there is a rapid increase of chaperone availability [1-4].
As one of the dominant members of the chaperone
family, heat shock protein (hsp) 70 shows strong and
preferential upregulation in various cell populations

exposed to stress conditions [5]. Following the general
principle of (poly)peptide chaperoning, hsp70 interacts
with proteins by transiently binding to amino acid
regions with distinct physicochemical properties.
Detailed sequence analyses of hsp-chaperoned polypeptides identified stretches of at least seven amino acids
with a core region of up to five hydrophobic amino
acids as prominent binding motif for members of the
hsp70 family [6,7]. Besides their function of (poly-)peptide guidance, chaperones induced by stress serve as
danger antigens to the innate immune system [8-11],
and those peptide regions of target proteins interacting
with the peptide binding region of chaperones may be
transferred onto MHC molecules. This mechanism has
been termed re-presentation (of endogenous peptides to
T helper cells) and may facilitate the induction of antitumor reactivity or the rise of autoimmunity [12-15].

generated from the precursor forms preproinsulin and
proinsulin. The mature, biologically active monomer of
insulin is composed of an A- and B-chain; its structure
is stabilized by intra- and inter-chain disulfide bonds.
Interestingly, insulin represents a dominant antigen
during the development of the immunological processes
leading to pancreatic b-cell destruction and (insulindependent) type 1 diabetes. Although the hormone is a
primary target of autoantibodies that emerge early in
the prediabetic phase [16] the stimulation of cellmediated immune processes including the activation of
insulin-reactive T-lymphocytes seems to be of major
importance for the progression of b-cell-directed
immune reactivity [17]. In fact, insulin-specific T-cells
can be isolated from human subjects both in the prediabetic phase and the onset of type 1 diabetes and are present in the diabetes-prone non-obese diabetic (NOD)
mouse, an animal model of the human disease [18,19].
In view of the chronic endoplasmatic reticulum stress
conditions with enhanced chaperone activity observed
for insulin producing pancreatic b-cells during islet
inflammation in (pre) type 1 diabetes as well as during
metabolic stress in states of insulin resistance and obesity [20,21], we hypothesized that (prepro-) insulin interacts with chaperones. In our experimental approach we
therefore determined the ability of preproinsulin-derived
13-mer peptides, monomeric proinsulin or native insulin
to bind to a chaperone. In the current study we used
bacterial hsp70 as the best characterized member of the
large and evolutionary well-conserved hsp70 chaperone
family [22].

Results
Identification of DnaK binding peptide regions in
preproinsulin

The interaction of the 70 kDa chaperone DnaK with
proinsulin was investigated by analyzing the binding of
the chaperone to immobilized 13-mer peptides covering
the entire length of the unprocessed precursor of the
hormone. Soluble DnaK showed differential affinities to
the membrane-bound peptides. As indicated by the
staining intensities of the spots in Figure 1A, four clusters of peptides covering four discrete regions of the
preproinsulin molecule exhibited increased DnaK retention capacities in a range similar to that of the control
peptides C1, C2 and C3 with well-documented high affinities to DnaK. One DnaK binding region was located
in the signal peptide (peptides 1-8) and a second in the
C-peptide (peptides 36-39), connecting the proinsulin
A- and B-chain. Two further DnaK binding regions
were located in the A-chain (peptides 46-50) and
B-chain (peptides 15-20). Densitometric analysis of
DnaK eluted from the immobilized peptides indicated
peak binding to peptides 1-7, 17-19, 36-39 and 46-50

(Figure 1B). The application of an algorithm developed to
predict the DnaK binding probability of peptides roughly
confirmed the location of three of these binding regions
in the preproinsulin molecule (signal peptide: peptides 15; B-chain: peptides 17 and 18; C-peptide: peptides 37
and 38) (Figure 1C). In contrast to the experimental findings, the algorithm did not predict DnaK binding for the
A-chain region, but identified an additional DnaK binding region at the position of the peptides 22 and 23
which are located in a region connecting the B-chain and
the C-peptide. As expected, the amino acid sequences of
the control peptides yielded DnaK binding with scores in
a range of -1.53 (C2) and -5.29 (C3).
The overlapping peptides with peak binding of DnaK
as determined in the solid phase assay were compared
with the underlying peptide sequence of preproinsulin.
The corresponding DnaK binding sequences in the preproinsulin molecule were amino acids S7-23 of the signal peptide, B9-25 of the B-chain, C15-31 of the
C-peptide and A6-21 of the A-chain (Figure 2).
Quantitative analysis of proinsulin peptide binding to
DnaK

Electro-elution of DnaK from immobilized peptides was
performed in three consecutive cycles and the progress
of peptide release was determined as an estimate of
their DnaK affinity. The amounts of DnaK eluted in the
first cycle (Figure 3A) correspond to the electroblots
shown in Figure 1A. The amounts of DnaK released
during elution cycles 2 and 3 were compared with the
release of DnaK from the high affinity control ligand C3
(set as 1 in Figure 3A). Most peptides retained DnaK
less than the control peptide during elution cycles 2 and
3 except for peptides 18 and 50. Of these two, peptide
18 exhibited better retention of DnaK indicating highest
affinity in this assay (Figure 3A, left panel).
Interestingly, the peptide 18 (B11-23) corresponds to
the insulin peptide B9-23, which had been identified as
an immunodominant epitope of autoimmune T-cell
reactivity in type 1 diabetes. Therefore, we analyzed the
interaction of DnaK with peptide B11-23 also in a fluid
phase assay. We determined the capacity of a peptide to
compete with the fluorescent high-affinity DnaK ligand
a-NR (dissociation equilibrium constant K’d = 0.41 ±
0.02 μM) for binding to DnaK [1]. Increasing concentrations of non-labeled peptide B11-23 resulted in a
decrease of the fluorescence signal reflecting effective
displacement of a-NR from DnaK by the peptide
(Figure 3B), corresponding to an apparent dissociation
equilibrium constant (K’d) of 2.2 ± 0.4 μM of the competing peptide B11-23. By contrast, peptide B18-30,
which is an adjacent peptide from the proinsulin Bchain region but without significant DnaK-affinity, was
much less effective in displacing a-NR (Figure 3B).

50 spots of overlapping 13-mer preproinsulin peptides and three spots of control peptides (C1, C2, C3) followed by electroelution and
identification of eluted DnaK by specific antibody and chemiluminescence. A: The grey-scales of the spots correspond to the amounts of DnaK
released from the peptide spots during the first elution cycle. B: Total DnaK released after the first (open bars), second (hatched bars) and third

correctly predict 95% of the good binding sites. With scores above -5 the reliability of the prediction of binding decreases.

Figure 3 Quantitative analysis of proinsulin peptide binding to DnaK. A: For DnaK-binding peptides of the proinsulin A-, B-chain or
C- peptide the amount of DnaK released during the three electroelution cycles was determined in order to assess the progress of DnaK
dissociation from the peptides. For this analysis the strength of the signals obtained from the high affinity DnaK ligand C3 after each elution
cycle (cycle 1: 134 LU; cycle 2: 46 LU; cycle 3: 33 LU) was set as “1” and used as reference for the signal strengths obtained from the investigated
peptides after the corresponding cycles of elution. For each peptide, the resulting three data points (corresponding to the three elution cycles)
were subjected to linear regression analysis and for better comparison of the progress of dissociation a line was plotted against the elution
cycles. The bold line in the left panel indicates the release of the B-chain peptide 18. In a fluid phase competition assay a-NR (200 nM) and DnaK
(1 μM) were incubated in the presence of increasing concentrations of peptide B11-23 (solid circles) or B18-30 (open circles) (B) or increasing
concentrations of proinsulin (solid circles) or insulin (open circles) (C). The difference in fluorescence emission intensity at 500 nm was plotted as
a function of the concentrations of peptides or proteins.

The DnaK affinity of insulin and insulin-derived peptides was determined in a competition assay as described in “Methods”. Lines indicate the disulfide bonds in
the insulin and proinsulin-molecules. The data show mean ± SD of three or four determinations.

Binding of DnaK to peptides versus intact insulin or
monomeric proinsulin

Next, we used the fluid phase assay to analyze whether
DnaK would interact with the intact insulin molecule.
Native insulin, only poorly competed with a-NR (K’d
67.8 ± 20.8 μM) (Figure 3C, Table 1) indicating that the
steric configuration of insulin oligomers prevents effective interaction with DnaK. Binding strength of insulin
was in the range of the poorly binding peptide B18-30
(K’d 51.9 ± 12.8 μM). For comparison, the sigma32derived control peptide, a high-affinity DnaK ligand,
exhibited a dissociation constant of 0.5 ± 0.1 μM. The
latter was in the same range as found for insulin peptide
B11-23 (Table 1).
Finally, we investigated the possible binding of DnaK
to a proinsulin variant with decreased propensity to oligomer formation due to an inversion of the K-P
sequence in the positions B28 and B29. This proinsulin
variant interacted with DnaK at concentrations much
lower than observed for insulin (K’d 11.3 ± 7.8 μM)
(Figure 3C, Table 1).

Discussion
Our experiments demonstrate that the 70 kDa heat
shock protein DnaK is able to bind to 13-mer peptide
segments of the preproinsulin molecule and that the
binding is limited to four distinct preproinsulin regions,
amino acids S7-23 of the signal peptide, B9-25 of the Bchain, C15-31 of the C-peptide and A6-21 of the Achain. These peptide regions exhibit the leucine-rich
motif found essential for binding of DnaK [23], usually a
hydrophobic core of four to five residues enriched in L,
but also in I, V, F and Y, and two flanking regions
enriched in basic residues. Of the proinsulin molecule,
strongest binding occurred to peptide 18 (B11-23), and

this is probably mediated by a distinct hydrophobic
motif formed by the three amino acid residues L-Y-L in
the central positions B15, B16 and B17. This conclusion
is supported by the finding that the B-chain-derived
peptide B18-30, which comprises the six C-terminal
residues of B11-23 but lacks the central L-Y-L sequence
or a corresponding hydrophobic motif exhibited no significant DnaK affinity.
Native insulin exhibited only low affinity to DnaK.
This observation indicates that steric hindrance prevents
effective interaction with the chaperone, possibly due to
the conformation of the polypeptide heterodimer or the
aggregation of insulin molecules into dimers, trimers or
hexamers, rendering the regions B11-23 and A6-21 less
accessible. As deduced from the crystal structure of the
insulin molecule http://swissmodel.expasy.org/repository,
the B11-23 epitopes are buried at the interface between
two mature insulin heterodimers, thus preventing access
to the peptide binding site of DnaK. Similarly, the Achain region A6-21 comprises a number of amino acid
residues localized at the interfaces of the insulin oligomers. In particular, the surface-exposed E-residue in
position A17 contributes to the stabilization of the
dimer-dimer interfaces by its interaction with the F-residue in position 1 of the B-chain. Moreover, the C-residue in position A7 which is located at the surface of the
insulin molecule, forms a stabilizing interchain disulfide
bond with the C-residue in position 7 of the B-chain
[24,25].
To further elucidate a potential impact of steric conditions on DnaK-insulin interactions we investigated the
DnaK binding of a proinsulin variant with an inversion
of the K-P sequence in positions B28 and B29 causing a
decreased tendency to oligomerization. This variant
indeed exhibited a much higher DnaK affinity than

Burkart et al. BMC Biochemistry 2010, 11:44
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/11/44

mature insulin. However, the Kd obtained for the
mature insulin molecule may only represent an estimate
for the (low) chaperone affinity of the hormone, as the
fluid phase system applied in our approach is optimised
for studies on the interaction of chaperones with peptides rather than larger proteins. Nevertheless, previous
studies which applied experimental systems designed to
investigate the binding of DnaK to polypeptides demonstrate weak, but significant interactions between DnaK
and full-length, native proteins [26]. In those studies,
DnaK binding was found to depend on the accessible
hydrophobic area of a protein and was characterized by
dissociation constants of 1 - 50 μM, a range comparable
to the Kd of 67.8 ± 20.8 μM found for insulin in our
current study. Taken together, these observation suggest
that not only the (pro)insulin peptides but also mature
proinsulin monomers can interact with DnaK and that
there is little interaction between DnaK and native oligomeric forms of insulin.
In our current approach we selected insulin as the predominant b-cell specific (auto-) antigen. DnaK was
selected as a representative member of the dominant and
phylogenetically high conserved hsp70 family with the best
characterized chaperone activity [27,28]. Although the
members of the hsp70 family were found to exhibit some
differences in peptide binding specificities [28] extensive
comparative analyses revealed a common binding specificity for peptide stretches of at least seven amino acid residues with a hydrophobic core [7,28] thus largely
resembling the hydrophobicity distribution pattern of the
insulin-derived peptide B11-23. Therefore, our analyses on
the interaction of potentially autoantigenic insulin peptides with the chaperone DnaK was performed in a suitable model system which only partially reflects the situation
in vivo, in human patients. Further detailed studies of the
interaction of insulin and proinsulin with human hsp70
isoforms will be needed to fully understand the rules of
(pro-)insulin-chaperone interaction.
Besides the chaperoning function, one other property
of hsp70 family chaperones is the ability to induce Tcell immune responses to complexed peptides
[14,15,29-31], and a role of this pathway has been postulated for the induction of autoimmune disease
[12,32,33]. It therefore is noteworthy that the three
DnaK-binding regions of proinsulin, amino acids B9-25
of the B-chain, C15-31 of the C-peptide and A6-21 of
the A-chain superimpose with the three major target
regions for T-cell autoimmune reactivity in the NOD
mouse model or in humans with b-cell autoimmunity
[18,34-36]. In the mouse model, the B-chain region
around B16 was identified as critical for disease development, i.e., mutating the native E in position B13 to Q
abolished T-cell reactivity to the peptide B9-23 [34].
Moreover, replacement of Y to A in position B16

Page 6 of 8

abrogated the response of B9-23 - reactive T-cell clones
as well as the development of diabetes in vivo [37]. I.e.,
the peptide B11-23 is closely associated with diabetes
pathogenesis, and its diabetogenic potential depends on
an intact core sequence, comprising the region which is
important for the binding of this peptide to DnaK.
As the insulin molecules with the mutated B-chains
completely retain their metabolic activity [34,37] it has
to be assumed that a single amino acid-exchange does
not impair the formation of the correct tertiary structure, a complex process that most likely involves proper
binding and assistance by chaperones. The findings
from the mutated insulin molecules therefore further
support the view, that the peptide binding motifs of chaperones are not determined by strictly defined amino
acid sequences but by more roughly defined peptide
properties, e.g. by the hydrophobicity distribution pattern within a stretch of amino acids [23]. In contrast, Tcell receptor-mediated peptide recognition is known to
be a highly selective and largely amino acid sequence
specific process. Based on these considerations it may
be speculated that chaperones are able to bind defined
sets of insulin peptides characterized by hydrophobic
motifs. Chaperone-peptide complexes may be recognized by antigen presenting cells which perform the ultimate decision on the pathogenicity of a peptide by
applying stringent, highly sequence-sensitive selection
criteria during processing and re-presentation of the
peptide in the context of MHC structures and co-stimulatory signals.
Further studies are warranted to analyze whether
enhanced binding of proinsulin monomers or misfolded
(pro)insulin to hsp70 family chaperones during periods
of b-cell stress contributes to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diabetes.

Conclusions
Our observations indicate that the hsp70 chaperone
DnaK is able to bind to three discrete regions of the
proinsulin molecule which are characterized by a central
hydrophobic amino acid motif flanked by regions
enriched for basic amino acids. Binding occurs to 13mer peptides and to a proinsulin molecule modified to
prevent oligomerization, but not to native insulin. The
three DnaK-binding regions of proinsulin, aminoacids
B9-25 of the B-chain, C15-31 of the C-peptide and A621 of the A-chain superimpose with the three major target regions for T-cell autoimmune reactivity in autoimmune diabetes.

synthesized by Chiron, Clayton, Victoria, Australia.
Human insulin was provided by Novo Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark and proinsulin was provided by Lilly
GmbH, Bad Homburg, Germany.
Binding of DnaK to cellulose-bound preproinsulin
peptides

A set of 13-mer peptides with an eleven amino acid
overlap, covering the entire sequence of human preproinsulin (110 residues) and three control peptides
with known high DnaK affinity (C1: WTYNAELLVLLEN (W436 - N448 from hemagglutinin); C2:
GNTLVIVTADHAH (G382 - H394 from alkaline phosphatase); C3: SHAMAPVLYLQDK (S192 - K204 from
sigma 32)) were synthesized in distinct spots on a cellulose membrane with an alanine-spacer at their COOHterminus (Jerini Bio Tools GmbH, Berlin, Germany). For
DnaK binding the peptide-carrying membrane was incubated for 60 min at 25°C with 100 nM recombinant
DnaK in 31 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 170 mM NaCl, 6.4
mM KCl, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 and 5% (w/v) sucrose.
Detection of DnaK retained by immobilized peptides

For the detection of peptide-bound DnaK the membrane was washed three times at 4°C with Tris-buffered saline (31 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 170 mM NaCl,
6.4 mM KCl) to remove unbound DnaK. Subsequently,
peptide-bound DnaK was transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes by fractionated
electroblotting in a semidry blotting unit at a constant
power of 0.8 mA/cm 2 . The anode buffer contained
Tris base and 20% (v/v) methanol and the cathode buffer (25 mM Tris base, 40 mM 6-aminohexanoic acid,
20% (v/v) methanol) was supplemented with 0.01 or
0.1% SDS. For the detection of transferred DnaK the
PVDF membranes were incubated with a mouse
monoclonal anti-DnaK antibody (Stressgen) for 90 min
at room temperature followed by an incubation with a
peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody
(Jackson Immuno Research Europe Ltd., Soham, UK)
for 1 h at room temperature and the application of a
chemiluminescence detection kit (ECL detection kit,
Amersham Biosciences) [38]. The intensities of the
resulting signals of the individual spots were quantified
by densitometric evaluation using a Lumi-Imager
workstation (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) and expressed as Luminescence Units (LU) or
used to determine the progress of DnaK release during
sequential electroelution.

Determination of dissociation equilibrium constants

DnaK was expressed and purified as described previously [39]. Peptide NR was labeled with the environmentally sensitive fluorophore acrylodan as described
[2]. The dissociation equilibrium constants (K’d) of the
complexes between DnaK and human insulin, proinsulin
and selected 13-mer insulin peptides were determined
by a competition binding assay with fluorescence-labeled
NR peptide (a-NR). a-NR (200 nM) was incubated with
1 μM DnaK in the presence of increasing concentrations
of competing substrate (human insulin, proinsulin or
insulin peptide) at 25°C. After reaching equilibrium
(~1.5 h), emission spectra were recorded from 400 nm
to 600 nm (bandpass 4 nm) with a Perkin-Elmer spectrofluorimeter LS50B equipped with a stirrer and a thermostatically controlled cuvette holder. The excitation
wavelength was set at 370 nm (bandpass 4 nm). Measurements were performed in a volume of 800 μl in 25
mM Hepes/KOH, 100 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, pH 7.4
containing 1 mM DTT and 1 mM ADP-Pi at 25°C. K’d
values were obtained from a least-squares fit of the difference in fluorescence emission intensity at 500 nm
(ΔF) between a-NR in the presence and absence of
DnaK as a function of the concentration of the competing substrate (human insulin, proinsulin or selected 13mer insulin peptides) to the equation
ΔF = ΔFmax xP / ( P + Kdx ( 1 + L / K’d ) )

(1)

P denoting the concentration of DnaK, L the concentration of the competing substrate (human insulin,
proinsulin or selected 13-mer insulin peptides), and Kd
the dissociation equilibrium constant of the DnaK•a-NR
complex in the presence of ADP and inorganic
phosphate.
