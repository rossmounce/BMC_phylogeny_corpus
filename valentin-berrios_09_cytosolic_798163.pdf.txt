Abstract
Background: Sporothrix schenckii is a pathogenic dimorphic fungus, the etiological agent of sporotrichosis, a
lymphocutaneous disease that can remain localized or can disseminate, involving joints, lungs, and the central nervous
system. Pathogenic fungi use signal transduction pathways to rapidly adapt to changing environmental conditions and S.
schenckii is no exception. S. schenckii yeast cells, either proliferate (yeast cell cycle) or engage in a developmental program
that includes proliferation accompanied by morphogenesis (yeast to mycelium transition) depending on the
environmental conditions. The principal intracellular receptors of environmental signals are the heterotrimeric G
proteins, suggesting their involvement in fungal dimorphism and pathogenicity. Identifying these G proteins in fungi and
their involvement in protein-protein interactions will help determine their role in signal transduction pathways.
Results: In this work we describe a new G protein α subunit gene in S. schenckii, ssg-2. The cDNA sequence of ssg-2
revealed a predicted open reading frame of 1,065 nucleotides encoding a 355 amino acids protein with a molecular weight
of 40.9 kDa. When used as bait in a yeast two-hybrid assay, a cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 catalytic subunit was identified
as interacting with SSG-2. The sspla2 gene, revealed an open reading frame of 2538 bp and encoded an 846 amino acid
protein with a calculated molecular weight of 92.62 kDa. The principal features that characterize cPLA2 were identified
in this enzyme such as a phospholipase catalytic domain and the characteristic invariable arginine and serine residues. A
role for SSPLA2 in the control of dimorphism in S. schenckii is suggested by observing the effects of inhibitors of the
enzyme on the yeast cell cycle and the yeast to mycelium transition in this fungus. Phospholipase A2 inhibitors such as
AACOCF3 (an analogue of archidonic acid) and isotetrandrine (an inhibitor of G protein PLA2 interactions) were found
to inhibit budding by yeasts induced to re-enter the yeast cell cycle and to stimulate the yeast to mycelium transition
showing that this enzyme is necessary for the yeast cell cycle.
Conclusion: A new G protein α subunit gene was characterized in S. schenckii and protein-protein interactions studies
revealed this G protein alpha subunit interacts with a cPLA2 homologue. The PLA2 homologue reported here is the first
phospholipase identified in S. schenckii and the first time a PLA2 homologue is identified as interacting with a G protein α
subunit in a pathogenic dimorphic fungus, establishing a relationship between these G proteins and the pathogenic
potential of fungi. This cPLA2 homologue is known to play a role in signal transduction and fungal pathogenesis. Using
cPLA2 inhibitors, this enzyme was found to affect dimorphism in S. schenckii and was found to be necessary for the
development of the yeast or pathogenic form of the fungus.

Background
Sporothrix schenckii is a dimorphic fungus that produces
lymphocutaneous lesions in humans and animals. It is
the etiologic agent of sporotrichosis, a subcutaneous lymphatic mycosis with a worldwide distribution [1]. In its
saprophytic form it develops hyaline, regularly septated
hyphae and pyriform conidia which can be found single
or in groups in a characteristic daisy-like arrangement. The
yeast or parasitic form shows ovoid cells with single or
multiple budding.
In S. schenckii, dimorphism is both a proliferative and
morphogenetic process. We have reported that in
response to different environmental stimuli, S. schenckii
unbudded synchronized yeast cells, either proliferate
(yeast cell cycle) or engage in a developmental program
that includes proliferation accompanied by morphogenesis (yeast to mycelium transition). Dimorphism in S.
schenckii, depends on transmembrane signalling pathways
that respond to cell density [2,3], external pH [2,3], cyclic
nucleotides [4] and extracellular calcium concentration
[5].
Dimorphism is an adaptation response to changing environmental conditions. The morphology displayed by
dimorphic fungi is probably the result of the stimulation
of membrane receptors by extracellular ligands. Heterotrimeric (αβγ) guanine nucleotide binding proteins have
been associated with membrane receptors and with morphogenetic transition signalling in many eukaryotes, and
play a crucial role in fungal morphogenesis as well [6].
They constitute a family of GTP hydrolases involved in
signal transduction pathways. These proteins are coupled
to membrane receptors (GPCR) that recognize different
extracellular signals. The α subunits of the heterotrimeric
G proteins bind GTP. The interaction of a ligand with the
GPRC initiates the exchange of bound GDP for GTP in the
Gα subunit resulting in the dissociation of the heterotrimer into α-GTP and βγ subunits. The dissociated α-GTP
subunit and the βγ dimer, relay signals to different targets
resulting in changes in cytoplasmic ionic composition or
in second messenger levels (e.g., cAMP) that ultimately
lead to a cellular response [7-10].
Genes encoding proteins that are similar to the Gα class of
the heterotrimeric G proteins have been described in filamentous fungi such as Aspergillus nidulans [11] and Neurospora crassa [12-14], as well as in fungal plant pathogens
like Cryphonectria parasitica [15,16], Ustilago maydis [17]
and Magnaporthe grisea [18], among others. In S. schenckii,
a 41 kDa Gα subunit homologous to the Gαi subunit and
sensitive to inhibition by pertussis toxin was described
previously by us [19]. This was the first Gαi subunit
described in a pathogenic dimorphic fungus.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/100

In higher eukaryotes, members of the Gα class are known
to regulate adenylate cyclase [20], cGMP phosphodiesterase [21], phosphoinositide-3-kinase [22], calcium and
potassium channels [22-24], and the activity of phospholipases [9,25-28]. In fungi, Gα subunits have been shown
to regulate adenylate cyclase, morphogenesis and pathogenicity [6,14,29,30]. Most of the studies related to determining the role of the heterotrimeric G protein subunits
in fungi involved the observation of the morphological
effects produced in the fungus when these genes are
deleted [6,12,14,18]. Nevertheless, the full scope of the
processes that Gα subunits regulate in fungi is still not
known and interactions between these subunits and cellular proteins have seldom been reported in pathogenic
fungi.
A large number of G protein coupled receptors have been
observed to induce activation of phospholipase A2 in
higher eukaryotic systems [31]. The PLA2 superfamily can
be classified according to cellular location or biological
properties [32]. The phospholipase A superfamily
includes the calcium dependent-secretory PLA2 (sPLA2),
the calcium independent-intracellular PLA2 (iPLA2) and
the cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2). They differ in terms of calcium
requirements, substrate specificity, molecular weight and
lipid modification. The sPLA2 is usually a 13 to 15 kDa
protein while the cPLA2 is a 85 kDa protein in human
macrophages. The cPLA2 possesses characteristics that suggest that it is associated to receptor-activated signal transduction cascades [33]. This PLA2 is known to translocate
to the membrane in response to an increase in intracellular calcium concentration [34]. Cytosolic PLA2 hydrolyses
the sn-2 position of phospholipids, resulting in the release
of lysophospholipids and free fatty acids. The most commonly released fatty acid is arachidonic acid, which in
turn is converted to eicosanoids that regulate multiple
processes including calcium channels, mitogenic signals
and most important, the inflammatory response of macrophages [31,32,35,36].
The present study was undertaken to identify the presence
of and characterize additional Gα subunits in S. schenckii,
to identify any important interacting partners of the new
Gα subunit, and finally to determine the involvement if
any of the interacting protein, in this case cPLA2, in the
control of dimorphism in this fungus. Here we give details
of the identification and sequencing of the ssg-2 gene,
including gene organization, the presence and position of
introns, derived amino acid sequence and conserved
polypeptide-encoded domains. Using SSG-2 as bait, we
identified a cPLA2 homologue interacting with this G protein α subunit. We give the genomic sequence of this gene
and the complete derived amino acid sequence. We also
report the effects on the yeast to mycelium transition and

the yeast cell cycle of phopholipase effectors in S.
schenckii.
This work constitutes the first report of the presence of
multiple G protein α subunits in S. schenckii, the presence
of a cPLA2 homologue interacting with this G protein α
subunit, and the involvement of cPLA2 in the control of
dimorphism in S. schenckii. In addition to being a very
important determinant of pathogenicity in fungi and
other organisms, cPLA2 is shown to have a direct effect in
the control of dimorphism in this fungus. This information will ultimately help us construct the signal transduction pathway leading from the G proteins onward and the
role of G proteins and its interacting partners in fungal
pathogenesis.

Results
Identification of the ssg-2 gene
Most fungal Gα subunit genes vary only slightly in size
within the region encoding the GESGKST and KWIHCF
motifs where primers for PCR are usually made because of
the conserved nature of these regions. In the region comprised between these primers size variations are usually
due to the presence of introns of slightly different sizes.
Two PCR products were obtained when using fungal DNA
as template and the GESGKST/KWIHCF primer pair one
belonging to ssg-1 and the other to ssg-2 of approximately
620 and 645 bp, respectively. The ssg-2 PCR product (645
bp) established the presence of a new gene encoding
another Gα subunit in S. schenckii. Figure 1A shows the
sequencing strategy used for the identification of this new
G protein α subunit gene. Once the coding sequence was
completed, it was confirmed using yeast cDNA as template and the MGACMS/KDSGIL primer pair. A 1,065 bp
ORF was obtained, containing the coding region of the
ssg-2 cDNA as shown in Figure 1B. Using the same primer
pair and genomic DNA as template a 1,333 bp PCR product was obtained. Sequencing of this PCR product confirmed the sequences obtained previously and showed the
presence and position of 4 introns. These introns had the
consensus GT/AG junction splice site and interrupted the
respective codons after the second nucleotide. The first
intron interrupted the codon for G42 and consisted of 82
bp, the second intron interrupted the codon for Y157 and
consisted of 60 bp, the third intron interrupted the codon
for H200 and consisted of 60 bp, the fourth intron starts
interrupted the codon H323 and consisted of 67 bp. With
the exception of the regions where introns were present in
the genomic sequence of the ssg-2 gene, the cDNA
sequence and genomic sequence were identical. The overlapping of these two sequences confirmed the presence of
the introns in the genomic sequence. The cDNA and
genomic sequence of ssg-2 have GenBank accession numbers AF454862 and AY078408, respectively.

Bioinformatic characterization of SSG-2
The derived amino acid sequence (GenBank accession
number AAL57853) revealed a Gα subunit of 355 amino
acids as shown in Figure 1B. The calculated molecular
weight of the ssg-2 gene product was 40.90 kDa. Blocks
analysis of the amino acid sequence of SSG-2 revealed a
G-protein alpha subunit signature from amino acids 37 to
276 with an E value of 5.2e-67 and a fungal G-protein
alpha subunit signature from amino acids 61 to 341 with
an E value of 3.3e-28 [37]. SSG-2 has the motifs encoding
the GTPase domain [38] with the corresponding consensus sequences involved in GTP binding shaded in gray in
Figure 1B. The phosphate binding loop which includes
the sequence GXGXXGKS is found in SSG-2 as GSGESGKS. The magnesium binding residues with the consensus sequence DXXG is present as DVGG in SSG-2, while
the guanine ring binding sites are those with the consensus sequence NKXD is present as NKVD. The TXAT consensus sequence is present as TQAT in SSG-2. Another
region involved in phosphate binding includes the consensus sequence RXXT that in SSG-2 is present as RTKT. In
addition to these conserved domains, the protein derived
from the ssg-2 cDNA sequence has the N-terminal glycine
that is myristoylated in Gα subtypes and is needed for
membrane association. The 5 residues that identify the
adenylate cyclase interaction site according to BLAST analysis [39] are in red in Figure 1, these include I187, K212,
I215, H216, and E 219. The putative receptor binding site
includes amino acids L318 to R334 and is shown in blue
letters in Figure 1[39].

The derived amino acid sequence alignment of SSG-2 to
that of the several fungal homologues is shown in Figure
2. This figure shows more than 85% identity to MAGA of
M. grisea [18], CPG-2 of C. parasitica [16] and GNA-3 of
N. crassa [14]. Table 1 summarizes the percent identity of
SSG-2 to some members of the fungal Gα homologues
and SSG-1.
Yeast two-hybrid screening
Two independent yeast two-hybrid screenings, using different S. schenckii yeast cells cDNA libraries were done
with the complete coding sequence of SSG-2 as bait. In
both screenings, 3 blue colonies growing in quadruple
drop out (QDO) medium (SD/-Ade/-His/-Leu/-Trp/X-αgal) were identified as containing the same PLA2 homologue insert. The expression of the Ade+, His+ phenotypes
and α galactosidase activity are considered by the manufacturer as corroborative of true interactions. The inserts
from all three colonies were found to contain the carboxyterminal residues of a protein homologous to PLA2's from
A. nidulans. Our results indicated that the last 162 amino
acids of the S. schenckii cPLA2 homologue interacted with
SSG-2.

Bioinformatic characterization of SSPLA2
The PANTHER Classification System identified this protein as a member of the cytosolic phospholipase A2 family
(PTHR10728) (residues 132–827) with an extremely significant E value of 6.4 e-97 [40]. BLAST analysis of the
derived amino acid sequence of the S. schenckii SSPLA2,
showed a phospholipase domain extending from amino
acids 177 to 750 [39]. Pfam analysis shows similar results,
and in this domain the PLA2 signature GXSG [G, S] (Pfam:
Family PLA2_B PF 01735) is present as GVSGS in the
active site (highlighted green in Figure 4B) [41,42]. The
amino acids needed for catalytic activity R235, S263 and
D553 are given in red in this same figure [43]. S263 is
essential for the formation of arachidonyl serine needed
for the transfer of the arachidonyl group to glycerol or to
water. The amino acids D511 to L523, D583 to G595 and
D738 to A750 (highlighted in yellow) comprise putative
EF hand domains of the protein (76% identity, probability, 3.33e-06). In Figure 4B a putative calmodulin binding
domain was identified from amino acids Q806 to L823
using the Calmodulin Target Database [44] and highlighted in gray. A serine protease, subtilase family, aspartic
acid active site motif was identified using Scan Prosite
with an E value of 5.283e-07 from amino acids 549 to 559
and is shaded in blue green in Figure 4B[45]. This motif is
characteristic of both yeast and fungal cPLA2 homologues
[43].

Figure 5 shows the multiple sequence alignment of the
derived amino acid sequence of S. schenckii PLA2 homologue to that of other PLA homologues or hypothetical
proteins from N. crassa, A. nidulans, M. grisea, Chaetomium
globosum, Podospora anserina and Gibberella zeae. This figure
shows that the important domains are very similar,
although variations occur in the N terminal and C terminal regions. The alignment shown includes only the catalytic domain, the complete alignment is given as
additional material (Additional file 1).
Effects of PLA2 effectors on the yeast to mycelium
transition and the yeast cell cycle
S. schenckii is not a genetically manageable organism,
therefore, effectors of PLA2 were tested for their effects on
the yeast to mycelium transition and the yeast cell cycle.
Arachidonic acid is the primary product of cPLA2 activity
on phospholipids, while AACOCF3 and isotetrandrine are
inhibitors of PLA2 activity. AACOCF3 is a known competitive inhibitor of PLA2 [46]. It is an analogue of arachidonic acid and presumably binds directly to the active site
of the enzyme. It is a potent and selective inhibitor of
cytosolic phospholipase A [46]. Isotetrandrine on the

the percentage of yeast cells forming germ tubes in the
presence and absence of arachidonic acid, AACOCF3 and
isotetrandrine. This figure shows that these latter compounds significantly stimulated the yeast to mycelium
transition at 6 and 9 h of incubation when the control

emergence [2]. The percent stimulation was approximately 68% and 33% at 6 h and 9 h of incubation in the
presence of both AACOCF3 and isotetrandrine. In the
presence of arachidonic acid a slight (25%) non-significant inhibition was observed at 6 h of incubation. The

Discussion
The heterotrimeric G protein family ranks among the
most important protein families identified as intracellular
recipients of external signalling. The present study was
conducted in order to describe new Gα subunit encoding
genes in S. schenckii, identify any important protein interacting with this G alpha subunit and determine the effects
on dimorphism in S. schenckii of the protein or proteins
identified.
The results presented here, together with our previous
report [19] corroborate the existence of more than one
heterotrimeric G protein α subunit gene in S. schenckii.
Unpublished results indicate that this protein is one of at

Effects of SSPLA2 effectors on the yeast budding cycle

Effects of SSPLA2 effectors on the yeast budding
cycle. Yeast cells grown, harvested, synchronized and
selected by filtration as described in Methods were induced
to re-enter the budding cycle in a basal medium with glucose
at pH 7.2 and incubated at 25°C in the presence and absence
of arachidonic acid (40 μM), AACOCF3 (100 μM; Nonadeca4,7,10,13-tetraenyl-trifluoro-methyl ketone) and isotetrandrine (50 μM; 6,6',7,12-tetra methoxy-2,2'-dimethyl-berbaman). All values are given as the average percentage ± one

t test was used to determine the statistical significance of the

units in filamentous fungi shows the existence of 3
distinct subfamilies of G protein alpha subunits [19].
According to the classification offered by Li and collaborators, SSG-2 belongs to Group III of the fungal G protein
alpha subunits [49]. The Group III considered by them to
be Gαs analogues because they positively influence cAMP
levels although they have more sequence similarity to Gαi
[49].
The nucleotide and amino acid sequence analysis of this
new G protein α subunit gene are different from the previously identified ssg-1 gene. The nucleotide conservation
of the coding region of ssg-2 is less than 50% when compared to that of the previously reported ssg-1 gene, confirming that ssg-1 and ssg-2 are two different genes (data
not shown). The derived amino acid sequence of ssg-2 is
50% identical to that of SSG-1, but they have differences
in the motifs that are characteristic of the G protein alpha
subunits, the most important difference being that SSG-2
lacks the cysteine residue in domain 5 that characterizes
the pertussis binding domain of SSG-1 (TCADT). For this
reason, SSG-2 belongs to the Gα class but cannot be
strictly considered a Gαi, even though it is 46% identical

to mammalian Gαi class members. This shows the high
degree of conservation in Gα subunits even among phylogenetically distant organisms.

It is interesting to note that A. nidulans PLA2 has been
reported to be responsive to calcium even though it also
lacks a C2 domain [51].

The work done in order to identify the role of Gα subunits
in the filamentous fungi has been mainly concerned with
the phenotypes observed when these genes are knockedout (as reviewed by [6]). In this paper a different approach
was used. We wanted to identify important protein-protein interactions between SSG-2 and the complex signalling system that regulates the flow of information from
the environment through the heterotrimeric G proteins
into the cell in S. schenckii. Using the yeast two-hybrid
technique we identified a cPLA2 homologue as interacting
with SSG-2 in two independent experiments, using two
different cDNA libraries. This SSG-2-PLA2 interaction was
also confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. Up to date,
protein-protein interactions of these Gα subunits have
not been reported in the pathogenic fungi, and the exact
proteins with which these Gα subunits interact have not
been identified. This is the first report of a cytosolic PLA2
homologue interacting with a G protein α subunit in a
pathogenic dimorphic fungus, suggesting a functional
relationship between these two important proteins. Other
proteins interact with SSG-2 (unpublished results), but
the SSG-2-PLA2 interaction is very important as it connects
this G protein α subunit with both pathogenicity and
lipid signal transduction in fungi [50].

Also contributing to the possible modulation by calcium
of this protein is the presence of a putative calmodulin
binding domain [44]. As in the case of the EF handmotifs, analysis of the PLA2 homologues of M. grisea, N.
crassa, G. zeae and in A. nidulans show the presence of possible calmodulin binding domains in different areas of
the proteins [44]. In S. schenckii the putative calmodulin
binding domain is at the C terminal end of the protein,
while in M. grisea, N. crassa and G. zeae it is within the first
150 to 250 amino acids.

This PLA2 homologue belongs to the Group IV PLA2 family that has been highly conserved throughout evolution.
BLAST searches of the amino acid sequence of SSPLA2
against the Homo sapiens database shows that it is phylogenetically related to the human Group IVA PLA2 family.
This same analysis using the fungal databases revealed
that SSPLA2 is more closely related to the phospholipases
of the filamentous fungi than to PLAB of yeasts. The similarity to both human and fungal phospholipases is found
primarily in the catalytic domain with a great deal of variation contained in the first and last 200 amino acids. In
the catalytic domain we find an important difference
between SSPLA2 and the human homologues. The former
has one continuous catalytic domain, rather than the
more typical cPLA2 structure where two homologous catalytic domains are present, interspaced with unique
sequences [43].

In addition to the identification of PLA2 as interacting
with SSG-2, we inquired as to the effects of PLA2 in S.
schenckii dimorphism. As mentioned previously, PLA2
hydrolyses the sn-2 position of phospholipids, resulting
in the release of lysophospholipids and free fatty acids.
The most commonly released fatty acid is arachidonic
acid. We tested the effects of exogenously added arachidonic acid on the kinetics of germ tube formation or the
yeast cell cycle in S. schenckii. Our results show that exogenously added arachidonic acid had no significant effect
on the kinetics of the yeast to mycelium transition, but a
significant stimulation (50%) in the percentage of budding in cells induced to re-enter the yeast cell cycle was
observed at 6 h of incubation in the presence of this compound. The observed stimulation of the yeast cell cycle by
arachidonic acid is consistent with the inhibitory effects
on this same cycle observed in the presence of AACOCF3
and isotetrandrine in S. schenckii, inhibitors of PLA2.
These inhibitors have different mechanisms of action as
stated previously. AACOCF3 is a competitive inhibitor of
PLA2 [46] and an analogue of arachidonic acid, while isotetrandrine interferes with G protein activation of PLA2
[47]. Both AACOCF3 and isotetrandrine increased significantly the percentage of cells with germ tubes at 6 and 9
h after inoculation and decreased budding in cells
induced to re-enter the yeast cycle. The AACOCF3 results
are consistent with our hypothesis that PLA2 activity is
needed for the yeast cell cycle in S. schenckii, specifically at
the start of DNA synthesis [3]. Furthermore, the isotetrandine results support the hypothesis that the interaction of
SSG-2 with PLA2 is required for these processes to occur.

SSPLA2 lacks the C2 motif found in cPLA2 of higher
eukaryotes. This domain is involved in the translocation
of the enzyme to the membrane in response to an increase
in intracellular calcium concentration [34]. Nevertheless,
SSPLA2 has 3 putative EF hand motifs suggesting that it
could also be calcium modulated. EF hand motifs are also
present in the PLA2 homologues of M. grisea, G. zeae, N.
crassa and A. nidulans in different areas of these proteins.

It is of interest to note that we recently reported similar
results in the presence of calmodulin inhibitor W7 and
inhibitors of calcium-calmodulin kinase in S. schenckii
[52]. Inhibiting calmodulin or calmodulin-dependent
kinase also inhibited the re-entry of yeast cells into the cell
cycle. We can speculate that by inhibiting the calmodulin
dependent kinase we are also inhibiting the migration of
cPLA2 to the membrane and/or its activation.

We cannot fully ascertain the functional consequences of
the observed interaction between PLA2 and SSG-2 at this
time. Future work will help us clarify this relationship.
Nevertheless, two important processes that have a bearing
in cell cycle progression have been identified as subjected
to cPLA2 activity in other systems: 1) the production of
biologically active molecules and 2) membrane remodeling [53].
There is very little information regarding the effects of the
primary metabolites released from the action of PLA2 (arachidonic acid and lysophospholipids) in fungi, Arachidonic acid was reported to stimulate adenylate cyclase
[54] in S. cerevisiae. If this is also true for S. schenckii, addition of arachidonic acid to the medium would be
expected to stimulate the yeast cell cycle and this was what
we observed. We had previously reported that dibutyryl
derivatives of cAMP inhibit the yeast to mycelium transition in S. schenckii [4].
On the other hand, membrane remodeling is also an
important function of enzymes such as phospholipases.
This process is needed for cell cycle progression and fungal morphogenesis [53]. It has been reported in other systems that in order for the cell cycle to occur there must be
a careful balance between membrane phospholipid synthesis and degradation. PLA2 has an important role in the
maintenance of this balance [35,55]. The lipid composition of the membrane is also essential for the correct
receptor-protein interactions and plays an important role
in signal transduction. G proteins are usually in molar
excess when compared to the GPRC's and a large number
of inactive GDP-bound heterotrimeric G protein molecules must be available in receptor-rich domains associated to membrane lipids [56].
G proteins can also affect PLA2 activity by a number of different mechanisms such as: increasing the intracellular
calcium concentration, transcriptional regulation and
stimulation of phosphorylation through different protein
kinases such as protein kinase C and MAP kinases (for a
review see [57]).
The studies presented here constitute the first evidence of
the interaction of G protein subunits of fungi with a phospholipase. These results establish for the first time a relationship between G proteins and the pathogenic
determinants of fungi. The identification of such an
important protein as partners of a G protein alpha subunit
in fungi suggests a mechanism by which these G proteins
can control pathogenicity in fungi. The existence of the
interaction reported here may offer an explanation as to
why fungi with decreased G protein alpha subunits such
as C. parasitica, hypovirus infection [15] and M. grisea
with disrupted Gα subunit gene, magB, exhibit reduced

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/100

levels of virulence [18]. This information is essential if we
are to understand the disease producing process of fungi.
It will also help elucidate the signal transduction pathway
leading from the G protein onward and will give us a better insight into signal transduction in pathogenesis and
dimorphism in S. schenckii.

Conclusion

We have shown the presence of a new G protein α subunit
in S. schenckii, SSG-2. The cDNA sequence of the ssg-2
gene encoded a 355 amino acid Gα subunit of 40.90 kDa
containing the 5 consensus domains present in all Gα
subunits. The genomic sequence has four introns, whose
positions are conserved in the other fungal homologues
of this gene.
Yeast two-hybrid analysis using the complete amino acid
sequence of SSG-2 identified a PLA2 homologue as an
interacting partner of this G protein subunit. This 846
amino acid protein was encoded by an intronless gene.
The 92.62 kDa protein encoded by this gene contained all
the domains and amino acid residues that characterize
cytosolic phospholipase A2.
PLA2 and other phospholipases in fungi have very diverse
roles not only as virulence factors but also in membrane
homeostasis and signal transduction. Inhibitor studies
showed that this PLA2 homologue and its interaction with
SSG-2 were necessary for the re-entry of S. schenckii yeast
cells into the budding cycle suggesting a role for this
important virulence factor in the control of dimorphism
in this fungus and for the expression of the yeast form. The
effects of PLA2 on the yeast cell cycle could be viewed as
resulting from the generation of lipid messenger molecules or from membrane remodelling that affects the G1>S transition and G protein activity.
The relationship reported here between these two proteins, SSG-2 and SSPLA2, constitutes the first report of the
interaction of a fungal phospholipase and a G protein
subunit and the possible involvement of G protein in fungal virulence and morphogenesis.

Yeast two-hybrid
MATCHMAKER Two-Hybrid System 3 was used for the
yeast two-hybrid assay (Clontech Laboratories Inc., Palo
Alto, CA) using all 3 different reporter genes for the confirmation for truly interacting proteins. For the construction of the bait plasmid, ssg-2 cDNA was obtained from
poly A+ RNA, transcribed and amplified by RT-PCR using
the Ready-to-Go TM Beads (Amersham Biosciences). The
RT-PCR product was amplified using primers containing
the gene sequence and an additional sequence containing
restriction enzyme sites, Xma I and BamH I at the 5' and
3' ends, respectively. The primers used were: Xma IMGACMS (fw) 5' ccccggggatgggggcttgcatgagt 3' and

The ssg-2 gene PCR product was cloned in frame into the
linearized bait plasmid, pGBKT7 (Clontech Laboratories
Inc.) using Quick T4 DNA ligase kit (New England Biolabs
Inc., Ipswich, MA, USA) and amplified in E. coli by transformation. Sequencing corroborated the sequence, correct
orientation, and frame of the inserted gene. The bait containing plasmid was isolated using Fast Plasmid™ Mini
technology (Brinkmann Instruments, Inc.) and used to
transform competent S. cerevisiae yeast cells (Y187). Competent S. cerevisiae yeast cells were transformed using the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/100

YEASTMAKER™ Yeast Transformation System 2 from
Clontech (BD Biosciences, Clontech Laboratories Inc.).
Tests for autonomous gene activation and cell toxicity
were carried out also as described by the manufacturer.
Double stranded cDNA was synthesized from S. schenckii
yeast cells Poly A+ RNA using SMART™ Technology Kit
(Clontech Laboratories Inc.). The cDNA's were amplified
using Long Distance PCR and size selected using the BD
CHROMA-SPIN™+TE-400 columns (Clontech Laboratories Inc.).
S. cerevisiae yeast cells AH109 were made competent using
the lithium-acetate (LiAc) method mentioned above and
transformed with SMART ds cDNA (20 μl) previously
amplified by LD-PCR and the linearized pGADT7-Rec
(Sma I-linearized plasmid). Transformants were selected
in SD/-Leu plates, harvested and used for mating with the
bait containing S. cerevisiae strain Y187. Mating of S. cerevisiae yeast cells strains Y187 (Mat-α) and AH109 (Mat-a)
was done according to the manufacturer's instructions.
The expression of three reporter ADE2, HIS3 and MEL1
genes in the diploids was used as confirmation for true
interacting proteins. Diploids expressing interacting proteins were selected in triple drop out medium (TDO), SD/
-Ade/-Leu/-Trp. Colonies growing in TDO medium were
tested for growth and α-galactosidase production in quadruple drop out medium (QDO), SD/-Ade/-His/-Leu/-Trp/
X-α-gal. Re-plating of these positive colonies into QDO
medium was done at least 3 times to verify that they maintain the correct phenotype. Colony PCR was also done to
corroborate the presence of both plasmids in the diploid
cells using the T7/3'BD sequencing primer pair for the
pGBKT7/ssg-2 plasmid and the T7/3'AD primer pair for
the pGADT7-Rec library plasmid. The PCR products
obtained with the T7 Sequencing Primer/3'AD Sequencing Primer pair were cloned and sequenced as described
above.
Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP)
S. cerevisiae diploids obtained in the yeast two-hybrid
assay were grown in 125 ml flasks containing 25 ml of
QDO for 16 h, harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 4 ml containing phosphate buffer saline (400
μl) with phosphatase inhibitor (400 μl), deacetylase
inhibitor (40 μl) (Active Motif North America, Carlsbad,
CA, USA) and protease inhibitors cocktail (40 μl) (EDTAfree, Thermo Scientific, Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford,
IL, USA). The cells were frozen in a porcelain mortar in
liquid nitrogen, glass beads added and the cells broken as
described previously [63]. The cell extract was centrifuged
and the supernatant used for Co-IP using the Immunoprecipitation Starter Pack (GE Healthcare, Bio-Sciences AB,
Bjorkgatan, Sweden) as described by the manufacturer.
Briefly, 500 μl of the cell extract (1–2 ug of protein/ml)

were combined with 1–5 μl of the anti-cMyc antibody
(Clontech, Corp.) and incubated at 4°C for 4 h, followed
by the addition of protein G beads and incubated at 4°C
overnight in a rotary shaker. The suspension was centrifuged and the supernatant discarded, 500 μl of the wash
buffer added followed by re-centrifugation. This was
repeated 4 times. The pellet was resuspended in Laemmeli
buffer (20 μl) and heated for 5 min at 95°C, centrifuged
and the supernatant used for 10% SDS PAGE at 110 V/1
h. Pre-stained molecular weight standards were electrophoresed in outside lanes of the gel (BioRad Corporation,
Hercules, CA, USA).
Western Blots
Western blots were done as described by us previously
[63]. The electrophoretically separated proteins were
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using the BioRad
Trans Blot SystemR for 1 h at 20 volts. After transferring,
the nitrocellulose strips were blocked with 3% gelatin in
TTBS (20 mM Tris, 500 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20, pH
7.5) at room temperature for 30–60 min. The strips were
washed for 5–10 min with TTBS. The TTBS was removed
and the strips incubated overnight in the antibody solution containing 20 μg of antibody, anti-cMyc or anti-HA
(Clontech, Corp.) was added to each strip. Controls where
the primary antibody was not added were included. The
antigen-antibody reaction was detected using the ImmunStar™ AP chemiluminescent protein detection system
from BioRad Corporation as described by the manufacturer.
Induction of the yeast to mycelium transition
The yeast form of the fungus was obtained from conidia
as described previously [2]. Briefly, yeast cell were grown
for 5 days from conidia in 125 ml flasks containing 50 ml
of medium M with aeration at 35°C. These cells were filtered through sterile Whatman #1 filters (GE Healthcare
Life Sciences). This procedure increases the concentration
of undbudded singlets to approximately 90%. The cells
were collected by filtration using Millipore filters
GSWP04700 (0.2 μm) (Millipore Corp. Billerica, MA,
USA), washed using basal medium with glucose and used
for inoculation to give a final concentration of 105 cells/
ml. These cells were induced to form germ tubes in the
presence and absence of effectors of PLA2 activity in a
basal medium with glucose at pH 4.0 and 25°C. Parallel
cultures were inoculated with unbudded yeast cells and at
6 and 9 h after inoculation the content of a flask was filtered for the determination of the percentage of cells with
germ tubes for each of the substances tested. These same
yeast cells were inoculated to give a final concentration of
107 cells/ml and induced to re-enter the yeast cell cycle as
described previously in the presence and absence of effectors of PLA2 in a basal medium with glucose at pH 7.2 and
25°C with aeration. At 6 and 9 h after inoculation sam-

ples were taken and the percentage of budding cells was
recorded.
The following substances were tested for their effects on
the yeast to mycelium transition and the yeast cell cycle:
arachidonic acid (40 μM; AACOCF3 (100 μM; Nonadeca4,7,10,13-tetraenyl-trifluoro-methyl ketone) [46] and isotetrandrine (50 μM; 6,6',7,12-tetra methoxy-2,2'-dimethyl-berbaman) [47]. These substances were obtained
from Calbiochem, EMD Biosciences Inc. (Darmstadt, Germany). The results are expressed as the average percentage
of cells with germ tubes or buds at 6 and 9 h of incubation
± one standard deviation of at least three independent
determinations. The Student t test was used to determine
the statistical significance of the data. A 95% confidence
level was used to determine statistical significance.

studies. WGV and LPS repeated the yeast two-hybrid analysis with a new cDNA library, identified PLA2 as an interacting protein for the second time and confirmed the
results with co-immunoprecipitation. RGM carried out
the sequence alignments and domain characterization of
SSG-2 and PLA2. NRV designed the study, drafted the
manuscript, completed the sequenced the sspla2 gene, participated in sequence identification, alignments and
domain characterization. All authors have read and
approved the final manuscript.
