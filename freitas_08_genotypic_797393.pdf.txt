Abstract
Background: Molecular studies of Bacillus diversity in various environments have been reported.
However, there have been few investigations concerning Bacillus in steel plant environments. In this
study, genotypic and phenotypic diversity and phylogenetic relationships among 40 bacterial
isolates recovered from steel plant waste were investigated using classical and molecular methods.
Results: 16S rDNA partial sequencing assigned all the isolates to the Bacillus genus, with close
genetic relatedness to the Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus groups, and to the species Bacillus
sphaericus. tDNA-intergenic spacer length polymorphisms and the 16S–23S intergenic transcribed
spacer region failed to identify the isolates at the species level. Genomic diversity was investigated
by molecular typing with rep (repetitive sequence) based PCR using the primer sets ERIC2
(enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus), (GTG)5, and BOXAIR. Genotypic fingerprinting
of the isolates reflected high intraspecies and interspecies diversity. Clustering of the isolates using
ERIC-PCR fingerprinting was similar to that obtained from the 16S rRNA gene phylogenetic tree,
indicating the potential of the former technique as a simple and useful tool for examining
relationships among unknown Bacillus spp. Physiological, biochemical and heavy metal susceptibility
profiles also indicated considerable phenotypic diversity. Among the heavy metal compounds
tested Zn, Pb and Cu were least toxic to the bacterial isolates, whereas Ag inhibited all isolates at
0.001 mM.
Conclusion: Isolates with identical 16S rRNA gene sequences had different genomic fingerprints
and differed considerably in their physiological capabilities, so the high levels of phenotypic diversity
found in this study are likely to have ecological relevance.

Background
The genus Bacillus encompasses Gram-positive rodshaped, endospore-forming aerobic or facultatively anaerobic bacteria, and is a phenotypically and phylogenetically diverse taxon [1]. Bacillus species are distributed
widely in nature. Bacillus cereus and Bacillus anthracis, both
of which belong to the B. cereus group [2], are amongst
those associated with human disease. Using 16S rDNA
sequence analysis, Ash et al. [3] described the presence of
five phylogenetically distinct groups in the genus Bacillus,
and Nielsen et al. [4] subsequently described a sixth group
belonging to the alkaliphilic bacilli. Two of these groups
are the B. cereus group (B. anthracis, B. cereus, Bacillus thuringiensis, Bacillus mycoides, Bacillus pseudomycoides and
Bacillus weihenstephanensis) and the Bacillus subtilis group
(B. subtilis, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus atrophaeus, Bacillus
licheniformis and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens) [3].
Since the genus Bacillus includes species of industrial, biotechnological and environmental interest, as well as clinically important species, various studies have been made of
its genetic diversity. However, it is still difficult to identify
and characterize new isolates, mainly because some species share morphological and biochemical characteristics
[3,5,6], which makes it hard to separate them. In addition,
species isolated from the environment have considerable
diversity with respect to physiology, DNA G + C content
and nutritional requirements [1,3,6,7]. Molecular
approaches are increasingly being used for rapid species
identification [8]. Various techniques, including tDNAPCR (tDNA-intergenic spacer length polymorphisms) and
ITS-PCR (16S–23S intergenic transcribed spacer region)
analyses have been used for identification and differentiation of bacterial species [9,10]. Repetitive element
sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR) genomic fingerprinting
has also been used for discriminating among a wide range
of bacterial genera and species, and to compare bacterial
genome diversity. This method can be used to generate
more accurate information because it is capable of screening several parts of the bacterial genome [11,12].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/1/92

to investigate the genotypic and phenotypic diversity of
40 Bacillus isolates obtained from this environment. This
was based on biochemical (API 50 CHB/E), physiological
(including susceptibility to heavy metals) and molecular
approaches. 16S rRNA gene sequencing, tDNA-PCR and
ITS-PCR analyses were used for taxonomic identification
of the isolates and to reveal phylogenetic relationships
among them. Other methods used in genetic characterization and differentiation of the isolates included ERIC,
BOX and (GTG)5.

Methods
Sampling and bacterial isolates
Blast furnace sludge (BFS) was sampled in triplicate from
a steel plant (Acesita-Cia Aços Especiais, Minas Gerais
state, Brazil) using sterilized bottles. BFS is produced after
the first step in ore processing, when the raw material is
subjected to high temperatures for ore separation. The
chemical composition of BFS was determined by Mössbauer and X-ray analyses as: 38.72% FeT, 6.74% Si, 4.60%
Zn, 2.29% Ca, 2.14% Mg, 1.81% Al, and traces of Cr, S, P
and Mn (< 1%).

Isolates were recovered from the BFS by blending 1 g wet
weight of the sample with 9 ml phosphate buffer and
shaking at 37°C for 24 h before serial dilution and plating
onto 1/10 strength tryptic soy agar (Difco). The resulting
colonies were purified by restreaking on the same
medium and incubating at 37°C, prior to use in molecular and phenotypic analyses. The type strains of B. subtilis
(ATCC 6633T), B. licheniformis (ATCC 14580T), B. pumilus
(ATCC 7061T), B. amyloliquefaciens (ATCC 23842), B.
cereus (ATCC 11778) and B. sphaericus (ATCC 14577T)
were included as reference strains.

Many studies have investigated Bacillus isolates originating from hospital, food and environmental samples [13],
but little attention has been given to isolates recovered
from steel-making wastes [14]. Blast furnace sludge (BFS)
contains tramp elements such as Zn, Ca, Mg and Al, preventing its recycling for steel production or other purposes. As steel industries generate about 700 kg of waste
per ton of steel produced, the removal or reduction of the
tramp elements by microorganisms could make steelwaste recycling viable, and provide ecological and economic benefits.

Morphological, physiological and biochemical
characteristics
Morphological and physiological characterization of the
40 isolates was based on the Gram reaction, shape, motility, endospore formation, and growth at different temperatures and NaCl concentrations. To confirm molecular
taxonomic identification of isolates as B. subtilis and B.
pumilus, the ability to hydrolyze starch was investigated.
The isolates were also identified according to their biochemical profiles using the API 50CH/B test kit
(BioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France), following the manufacturer's instructions, and according to their utilization
of citrate and indol, and hydrogen sulphide production,
performed as described previously [15]. API test kit results
were interpreted using the Analytical Profile Index (API)
database of the Apiweb software (version 4.0; BioMérieux,
Marcy l'Etoile, France).

As the microbial communities in steel-making wastes
have rarely been examined, the purpose of this study was

The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of heavy
metals (mercury chloride, silver nitrate, lead nitrate,

cobalt chloride, copper sulphate, zinc sulphate and nickel
chloride) were determined by a serial two-fold agar dilution method using nutrient agar (Difco). All heavy metals
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).
DNA extraction, PCR amplification, sequencing of 16S
rDNA, and phylogenetic analysis
Genomic DNA of the isolates was prepared as described
previously [16]. 16S rRNA genes were amplified using the
primers 8F and 907R, and the amplification cycling conditions [see Additional file 1]. All sequencing reactions
were performed using the Dynamic ET Dye (Amersham
BioSciences) sequencing kit, and reactions were analyzed
on a MegaBACE 1000 capillary sequencer (Amersham
BioSciences). Sequences were compared with available
databases using the GenBank BLASTN and RDP Classifier
search tools to determine approximate phylogenetic affiliations. To accomplish this, the partial 16S rRNA gene
sequences were basecalled, checked for quality, aligned
and analyzed using Phred v.0.20425 [22], Phrap
v.0.990319 [23] and Consed 12.0 [24] software. The phylogenetic relationships were inferred by MEGA 3.1 [25]
using the Neighbor-Joining (N-J) method and the Kimura
2-P model of sequence evolution. The robustness of the
phylogenetic tree topology was evaluated with 1000 replicates of bootstrap analysis [26,27]. The nucleotide
sequences generated were deposited in the GenBank database with accession numbers EU689117 to EU689157.
tDNA-PCR, ITS-PCR and rep-PCR DNA fingerprinting
Three variations of rep-PCR genomic fingerprinting were
performed using the ERIC, BOX and (GTG)5 primers. The
primers and the amplification cycling conditions for the
rep-PCR, tDNA and ITS-PCR [see Additional file 1]. Products were separated by electrophoresis in 2% agarose in 1
X TBE buffer for 3.5 h at 65V, and visualized by staining
with ethidium bromide (0.5 mg/mL). Fingerprints generated were compared visually. The reproducibility of the
fingerprint profiles obtained was assessed in at least three
separate experiments.
Cluster analysis
For cluster analysis, the data were converted to a binary
matrix, where the digits 1/0 represent the presence/
absence of a phenotypic character or DNA band. The similarity matrix was generated by Euclidean distances, which
were used to build a tree with the unweighted pair group
mean averages (UPGMA) algorithm. Analysis of data was
performed using the software PAST [28].

Results
The 16S rDNA sequences used for phylogenetic analyses
were 666 nucleotides long and spanned the V2 to V5 variable regions, corresponding to Escherichia coli K12 16S
rDNA. The 16S rDNA sequences of the reference strains

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/1/92

used in the study were obtained from GenBank, except for
those of B. amyloliquefaciens ATCC 23842. The phylogenetic tree based on these sequences revealed close relationships among the isolates and with other members of
the genus Bacillus (Fig. 1).
Based on 16S rDNA sequence analysis, 13 isolates clustered with the B. pumilus strains ATCC 7061 and ATCC
27142 at 99.8% similarity. Nine isolates had a sequence
similarity of 99.9% with B. amyloliquefaciens (ATCC
23842). Slightly lower similarities (99.7% and 99.5%)
were found for these nine isolates with B. subtilis (ATCC
6633) and B. licheniformis (ATCC 14580), respectively.
Seventeen isolates clustered at 99.9% sequence similarity
with the B. cereus group (B. cereus, B. mycoides and B.
anthracis). Fifteen of these 17 isolates had identical 16S
rRNA gene sequences. The sequence of isolate 36BFS had
97.1% similarity with B. sphaericus (ATCC 14577).
ITS and tDNA-PCR are used as molecular markers to differentiate isolates at the species level. The resolution powers of ITS-PCR and tDNA-PCR were evaluated using the
reference strains of Bacillus species identified from the 16S
rRNA gene sequencing analyses (Fig. 1). The ITS and
tDNA-PCR fingerprinting gave 10 and 11 distinct patterns, respectively (Fig. 2A and 2B). The Bacillus isolates,
grouped on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence phylogeny, had identical ITS and tDNA-PCR patterns, except for
the tDNA-PCR of four isolates of the B. cereus group. These
patterns differed from those of all the reference strains.
Rep-PCR genomic fingerprinting has been used in many
organisms to infer phylogenetic relationships among isolates, and to study their diversity in a variety of ecosystems. The fingerprint patterns of the 40 isolates generated
by ERIC, (GTG)5 and BOX-PCR were complex, producing
a large number of polymorphic bands of variable intensity
(Figs 3A, 4A and 4B). Thirty-six bands were identified by
BOX-PCR (approximately 200 to 4000 bp), 34 bands by
ERIC-PCR (200 to 4000 bp) and 49 bands by (GTG)5-PCR
(200 to 4000 bp). All reference strains had unique profiles
in all genomic fingerprinting analyses, and did not match
any of the patterns obtained for the Bacillus isolates.
Among the three sets of primers, (GTG)5-PCR fingerprinting gave the broadest band pattern. BOX-PCR amplifications were negative for two isolates (8BFS and 31BFS),
based on three independent PCRs. Negative results were
also observed with ERIC-PCR fingerprinting for isolate
33BFS. The dendrogram based on ERIC-PCR fingerprinting analysis (Fig. 3B) showed a clustering of isolates similar to that of the 16S rDNA phylogenetic tree. With ERICPCR, only isolate 36BFS (cluster 1) grouped outside its
16S rDNA phylogenetic tree cluster (cluster 3, Fig. 1). The
dendrogram generated from multi-rep-PCR fingerprinting

(Fig. 4C) revealed considerable genetic heterogeneity
among the isolates and reference strains.
The API 50 CH system was used to assist typing of the isolates to the species level, and to study their phenotypic
diversity. Data from API 50CH/B and additional physiological tests [see Additional file 2]. All 40 isolates were
motile, Gram-positive, spore-forming rods. Fifteen grew
at 55°C and 12 grew at 8°C, while 32 and 13 isolates were
able to grow in 7.5% and 15% NaCl, respectively. Only
two of the isolates used citrate as a sole carbon source and
three isolates produced hydrogen sulphide. The most
commonly used substrates were esculin and D-ribose, and
the least commonly used were inulin and potassium gluconate. In an attempt to discriminate B. pumilus species
among the 22 isolates that clustered within the B. subtilis
group, the ability to hydrolyze starch was tested. Five of
the isolates were starch-hydrolysis-negative, placing them
close to B. pumilus.

The 40 isolates were assigned to genus or species based on
their API 50CH/B biochemical profiles. Most (n = 28)
were assigned to the genus Bacillus at a confidence level
greater than 90%, while the remaining 12 isolates were
identified to the species level as B. pumilus (n = 6), B.
cereus (n = 1), Bacillus coagulans (n = 1), Brevibacillus laterosporus (n = 1) and Aneurinibacillus aneurinilyticus (n = 3).
Based on the API identification data, the 40 isolates were
highly similar to 3 genera of the Bacillaceae and Paenibacillaceae families. This system failed to identify all of
the reference strains to the species level. Moreover, based
on the dendrogram generated from the biochemical profile data (Fig. 5A), we observed that most of the isolates
used unique combinations of the growth substrates
tested.
In the heavy metal assays the highest minimum inhibitory
concentrations (MICs) were found for Cu and Pb (4 mM,
Table 1). The MIC levels were lower for Zn, Ni, Co and Hg,

Page 7 of 11

BMC Research Notes 2008, 1:92

with 90% of the isolates being inhibited by concentrations ranging from 0.025 to 2 mM. All isolates were inhibited by Ag at the lowest concentration tested. An MICbased dendrogram revealed profiles of distinct combinations of heavy metals for almost all isolates. The reference
strains formed a separate cluster (Fig. 5B). No significant
relationship was found between isolate clustering based
on this characteristic versus their phylogenetic position.

Discussion
It is well known that 16S rDNA sequences are good indicators of phylogenetic relationships among bacteria at the
intra- and interspecies levels. In our study the 16S rRNA
gene sequence analyses yielded very good identification of
the isolates at the genus (Bacillus) level. As expected, analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences alone was not sufficient
to identify Bacillus species, as has also been reported in
other studies [29,30]. Identification of the bacteria using
the API CHB50 system generally identified isolates to the
genus level, and in some cases to the species level, but the
identifications obtained using the API system and by 16S
rDNA sequencing differed. Nevertheless, biochemical and
physiological test data were useful in identifying characteristics that are considered typical of the genus Bacillus,
allowing phenotypic characterization of the isolates.
Identifications based on 16S rRNA gene sequences are
often limited, so fingerprint methods have been developed to characterize and distinguish Bacillus isolates [7,911]. We used ITS-PCR, tDNA-PCR and rep-PCR genomic
fingerprinting to examine phylogenetic relatedness
among the isolates. Overall, the isolates phylogenetically
closest to B. sphaericus and B. pumilus, and to the B. subtilis
and B. cereus groups were clearly different from the reference strains.
ITS and tDNA-PCR are frequently used to identify bacterial species and to analyze their phylogenetic relationships [9]. Although there was sufficient resolution to
differentiate among reference strains, it was not possible
to associate the Bacillus isolates with the reference strains
using this technique.

unknown Bacillus isolates. The dendrogram generated
from multi-rep-PCR fingerprinting separated the environmental Bacillus isolates as a distinct group from the reference strains. There was less similarity among the reference
strains than among the Bacillus isolates, perhaps reflecting
their different origins.
Although the isolates had identical 16S rRNA gene
sequences, they demonstrated considerable genotypic and
phenotypic heterogeneity. Almost all isolates used a distinctive combination of API 50CH/B substrates, suggesting that each occupied a different ecological niche and
revealing the co-existence of phylogenetically closely
related bacteria in the same environment. Similar results
were obtained in relation to heavy metal susceptibility.
However, the reference strains clustered apart from the
isolates, suggesting that the latter have more similar phenotypes despite their genotypic differences, probably
owing to their shared environmental origin; this is contrast to the dendrogram derived from the API 50CH/B
profiles.
Although the API 50CH/B system failed to identify the
isolates and reference strains to the species level, it was
useful for biochemical characterization and revealed significant variability among the isolates. Based on an inability to hydrolyze starch, 5 of the 22 isolates of the B. subtilis
group were affiliated with B. pumilus. The isolates that
affiliated with B. pumilus by molecular analysis (16S
rDNA) had greater physiological diversity.

Conclusion
Based on molecular characterization, most of the isolates
were closely related to the species B. pumilus and B.
sphaericus, and the B. subtilis and B. cereus groups. Despite
the polyphasic approach, it was difficult to identify the
environmental Bacillus isolates at the species level. We
found high genotipic and phenotypic heterogeneity in the
Bacillus isolates, despite their common origin from a single steel-making waste source.

Competing interests
The authors declare that they have no competing interests.

Genotype is less affected by environmental factors than
phenotype, so the rep-PCR method was used to determine
intraspecies diversity among the different Bacillus isolates.
We found that isolates with the same partial 16S rDNA
sequence often had quite dissimilar rep-PCR patterns. The
primer specific for (GTG)5 was less efficient than the BOX
and ERIC primer sets for grouping the isolates. ERIC-PCR
fingerprinting and 16S rDNA phylogenetic analyses gave
similar clusters. ERIC-PCR fingerprinting clustered reference and environmental B. cereus strains in the same way
as the 16S rDNA tree, suggesting the former is a good
approach to examining genetic relationships among
