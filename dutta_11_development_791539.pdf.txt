Abstract
Background: Pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millspaugh], one of the most important food legumes of semi-arid
tropical and subtropical regions, has limited genomic resources, particularly expressed sequence based (genic)
markers. We report a comprehensive set of validated genic simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers using deep
transcriptome sequencing, and its application in genetic diversity analysis and mapping.
Results: In this study, 43,324 transcriptome shotgun assembly unigene contigs were assembled from 1.696 million
454 GS-FLX sequence reads of separate pooled cDNA libraries prepared from leaf, root, stem and immature seed of
two pigeonpea varieties, Asha and UPAS 120. A total of 3,771 genic-SSR loci, excluding homopolymeric and
compound repeats, were identified; of which 2,877 PCR primer pairs were designed for marker development.
Dinucleotide was the most common repeat motif with a frequency of 60.41%, followed by tri- (34.52%), hexa(2.62%), tetra- (1.67%) and pentanucleotide (0.76%) repeat motifs. Primers were synthesized and tested for 772 of
these loci with repeat lengths of ≥18 bp. Of these, 550 markers were validated for consistent amplification in eight
diverse pigeonpea varieties; 71 were found to be polymorphic on agarose gel electrophoresis. Genetic diversity
analysis was done on 22 pigeonpea varieties and eight wild species using 20 highly polymorphic genic-SSR
markers. The number of alleles at these loci ranged from 4-10 and the polymorphism information content values
ranged from 0.46 to 0.72. Neighbor-joining dendrogram showed distinct separation of the different groups of
pigeonpea cultivars and wild species. Deep transcriptome sequencing of the two parental lines helped in silico
identification of polymorphic genic-SSR loci to facilitate the rapid development of an intra-species reference
genetic map, a subset of which was validated for expected allelic segregation in the reference mapping
population.
Conclusion: We developed 550 validated genic-SSR markers in pigeonpea using deep transcriptome sequencing.
From these, 20 highly polymorphic markers were used to evaluate the genetic relationship among species of the
genus Cajanus. A comprehensive set of genic-SSR markers was developed as an important genomic resource for
diversity analysis and genetic mapping in pigeonpea.

Background
Pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millspaugh] is an important food legume predominantly cultivated in the tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is a
diploid (2n = 22), often cross-pollinated crop with a

genome size of 858 Mbp [1]. Pigeonpea plays an important role in food and nutritional security because it is a
rich source of protein, minerals and vitamins. Pigeonpea
seeds are mainly consumed as split pea soups or ‘dal’
but a significant proportion is also eaten as green pea
vegetable and as wholegrain preparations. In addition,
pigeonpea leaves, seed husks and pods are used as
animal feed, whereas the stem and branches are used as
firewood. The world acreage of pigeonpea is 4.67 Mha

with an annual production of 3.30 Mt. India is the
largest producer and consumer of pigeonpea (local
names ‘arhar’ and ‘toor’) with an annual production of
2.31 Mt, followed by Myanmar (0.60 Mt), Malawi
(0.16 Mt) and Kenya (0.10 Mt) [2].
Knowledge of the genetic basis of yield, resistance to
diseases and insect pests and abiotic stress tolerance are
important factors for deciding the breeding strategies
for genetic improvement of pigeonpea. However, in
comparison to other economically important crops, relatively less effort has been invested in understanding the
genetics of important agronomic traits of pigeonpea.
Although there are ongoing efforts for pigeonpea
improvement through conventional breeding, including
hybrid technology, molecular breeding has a greater
potential to accelerate the utilization of genetic
resources in pigeonpea, especially among land races and
related germplasm lines [3-8]. The availability of
molecular markers that are tightly linked to important
agronomic traits is a prerequisite for undertaking molecular breeding in plants. However, the genetic basis of
most agronomic traits in pigeonpea has been worked
out using conventional biometric techniques that have
inherent limitations. The molecular basis of traits
remains entirely unexplored and to date no molecular
linkage map has been reported for pigeonpea [9,10].
This can be attributed to: (i) the low level of DNA polymorphism within the primary (cultivated) gene pool
assessed by means of RAPD, RFLP, AFLP and recently
by diversity array technologies (DArT) [11-15]; and (ii) a
paucity of molecular markers available for genetic analysis in pigeonpea [16-20].
Simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers have the advantage of high abundance, random distribution within the
genome, high polymorphism information content and
co-dominant inheritance. However, genomic SSR markers developed from SSR-enriched genomic libraries or
random genomic sequences are derived primarily from
inter-genic DNA regions, and therefore have uncertain
linkage to the transcribed regions of the genome. In
contrast, genic-SSRs specifically target the transcribed
region of the genome and have increased potential for
linkage to loci that contribute to agronomic phenotypes.
As a consequence, when polymorphic genic-SSRs are

identified in high value breeding lines they can have
considerable utility for marker assisted selection (MAS)
[21]. Genic-SSR markers can also facilitate better crossgenome comparisons because they target protein-coding
regions that are more likely to be conserved between
related species [22]. Expressed sequence tags (ESTs)
based on Sanger’s sequencing technology have become
increasingly abundant in public DNA databases and are
being used for genetic analyses, comparative mapping,
DNA fingerprinting, diversity analysis and evolutionary
studies [23,24]; but only a limited number of pigeonpea
Sanger ESTs are available in the public database [9].
We report the development of a large expressed
sequence dataset based on 454 GS-FLX pyrosequencing
of cDNA pools from two popular cultivars of pigeonpea,
which are parents of the reference mapping population.
We mined and validated a large set of genic-SSR markers and describe their application for understanding
the genetic relationship among selected pigeonpea cultivars and wild Cajanus species. The dataset was also useful for in silico mining of polymorphic genic-SSR loci
for the creation of an EST-based intra-species reference
genetic map.

Results
Assembly of non-redundant transcriptome shotgun
assembly (TSA) contigs of pigeonpea

Two runs of 454 GS-FLX pyrosequencing generated
1,696,724 high quality filtered expressed sequence reads
from two separate cDNA library pools of widely adapted
pigeonpea cultivars ‘Asha’ and ‘UPAS 120’. In preparation for 454 sequencing, cDNAs were sheared stochastically to randomly represent all transcripts. Sequence
data described in this paper can be found in the
Sequence Read Archive (SRA) public database of the
NCBI (Ac. No. SRP002556, SRP002557). The total dataset represents 566.6 Mbp of sequence with an average
read length of 334 bp. These reads were first assembled
separately into 35,204 TSA contigs for Asha (NCBI Ac.
No. EZ647865- EZ683068) and 30,147 TSA contigs for
UPAS 120 (NCBI Ac. No. EZ617718- EZ647864) using
the 454 ‘Newbler’ sequence assembler with average
depths of coverage of 10.41 and 10.10, respectively
(Table 1). To obtain a non-redundant set of unigene

sequences, the total 65,351 TSA contigs from the two
cultivars were assembled together using Lasergene SeqMan Pro™ Version 8.0.12 software into 43,324 unigene
sequences with a total sequence length of 31.6 Mbp
(Table 2). Of the 31.6 Mbp sequence, 21.9 Mbp was
from 17,305 sequence contigs common to Asha and
UPAS 120, 5.9 Mbp from 15,525 contigs unique to
Asha, and 3.6 Mbp from 10,494 contigs unique to
UPAS 120. This 31.6 Mbp of TSA sequence was 3.7% of
the estimated 858 Mbp size of the pigeonpea genome
and was used for in silico mining and validation of
genic-SSR markers (Figure 1).

Frequency distribution of different types of genic-SSR loci

A total of 3,771 SSR loci were identified in 3,327 TSA
contigs, representing 7.6% of the total 43,324 unigene
TSA contigs (Figure 1). This study did not include
mononucleotide repeats, complex SSR or SSR loci with
lengths less than 10 bp. Among the SSR containing contigs, 3,028 (91%) possessed single SSR loci, while 299
contigs (9%) had 2-4 SSR loci each. On an average there
was one SSR locus for every 8.4 kbp of TSA unigene
sequence, corresponding to one SSR for every 11.5 TSA
unigene contigs. Dinucleotide was the most common
repeat unit with a frequency of 60.41%, followed by tri(34.52%), hexa- (2.62%), tetra- (1.67%) and pentanucleotide repeats (0.76%) (Additional file 1a). SSR loci with
di- and trinucleotide repeats constituted 3,580 (95%) of
the identified loci. The number of reiterations of a given
repeat unit varied from 5 to 22 (Additional file 1b), and
SSRs with five reiterations (the minimum limit set during the SSR marker discovery) were the most abundant.
The frequency of a given SSR structure and the number
of repeat units in it showed an inverse relationship (Additional file 1b). Hence, SSR loci with less than five repeats
are expected to be even more abundant but were not
included in the present investigation because they would
not be useful in the study of detectable polymorphism
[25]. Motifs showing more than 10 reiterations were rare
with a frequency of <1% (Additional file 2). SSR markers

with a length of 10 bp, the low end cut-off for SSR retention, were the most frequent (36%) followed by 15 bp
(19%), 18 bp (12%) and 12 bp (11%) lengths; the longest
SSR locus was of 66 bp (Additional file 1c). From the
3,771 genic-SSR sequences, 207 distinct repeat motifs
were identified, (the 10 most frequent motifs are shown
in Additional file 2). Dinucleotide repeat units TC/GA,
AG/CT and TA/TA were the most abundant with frequencies of 17.20%, 16.67% and 9.41%, respectively.
Among the trinucleotide repeat motifs, GAA/TTC and
CTT/AAG were the most abundant with frequencies of
3.87% and 2.65%, respectively (Additional file 2).
Development and validation of genic-SSR markers

PCR primers were designed from the unique sequences
flanking 2,877 SSR loci identified in the TSA contigs for
the development of genic-SSR markers and were designated ASSR1 to ASSR2877 (A= ‘Arhar’, Additional
file 3). Primers could not be designed for the remaining
894 SSR loci because their flanking sequences were
either too short or the nature of sequence did not fulfill
the criteria for primer design using BatchPrimer3 v 1.0

software [26,27]. From the 2,877 SSR markers, 772 loci
with n ≥ 18 bp including type I SSR markers (n ≥ 20
bp) were selected for primer synthesis and validation
due to their high chance of showing polymorphism on
agarose gel electrophoresis [25,28].
Of the 772 genic-SSR loci for which primers were
synthesized, 550 yielded PCR amplicons of expected size
and we designated these as “validated genic-SSR markers”, as shown in Additional file 4. In addition, 51 primer pairs amplified larger than the expected size
products, 18 primer pairs amplified multiple products
(≥3 bands), and 153 primer pairs failed to amplify even
when the annealing temperature was reduced by 7°C.
All the 550 validated genic-SSR markers were scored for
amplicon size polymorphism among eight pigeonpea
varieties showing 71 (12.9%) polymorphic loci. Sixty-six
of these polymorphic genic-SSR loci showed only two
alleles each among the eight tested varieties; four loci
possessed three alleles each, while one SSR locus
(ASSR281) possessed five alleles. The PIC values of the
71 polymorphic genic-SSR markers ranged from 0.23 to
0.83 with an average of 0.38 (Table 3). Although a large
proportion of the SSR loci was monomorphic in the

eight pigeonpea varieties, some of these are likely to
show polymorphism on analysis of a larger set of
varieties. Use of more sensitive techniques for DNA
fragment size analysis, e.g. polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or capillary electrophoresis, is also expected to
show a higher rate of polymorphism.
The 550 SSR loci were searched against the nonredundant (nr) protein database of NCBI using BLASTX
to assign functions to the TSA unigene sequences. This
database includes all non-redundant GenBank CDS
translations, PDB (Protein Data Bank), SwissProt, PIR
(Protein Information Resource) and PRF (Protein
Research Foundation), excluding environmental samples
from Whole Genome Sequencing projects. The search
output was used to categorize these expressed sequences
into two classes: (i) putative known function, and (ii)
unknown function, similar to that used for rice genes
[29], except that there can be no hypothetical protein
category here due to the transcriptomic origin of the
sequences, hence matches with hypothetical protein
annotations were also classified as unknown (Additional
file 4). Putative known functions could be assigned to
297 (54%) sequences that showed a significant homology
to reported proteins. The remaining 253 (46%)
sequences were of unknown function, including 105
(19%) sequences which did not show a significant match
in the database and therefore may encode proteins that
are unique to the pigeonpea genome, or may correspond
to an untranslated region (UTR) and/or diverged
C-terminal coding region. Our analysis of the location
of SSR markers within the TSA contigs revealed that
among the 550 validated genic-SSR markers, 339
(61.6%) were located in the protein coding region, 87
(15.8%) in the 5’-UTR and 124 (22.5%) in the 3’-UTR
(Additional file 4). Analysis of polymorphism among the

three categories of genic-SSR loci revealed that those
located in the 3’-UTR were the most polymorphic
(23.4%), followed by 5’-UTR (12.6%) and coding
sequences (9.1%). Further annotation of all the 43,324
TSA unigene contigs and single nucleotide polymorphism characterization between the reference varieties
Asha and UPAS 120 is in progress.
Assessment of genetic diversity among pigeonpea
varieties and related species

The 20 highly polymorphic genic-SSR markers designed
in this study were used to assess the genetic diversity in a
set of 30 genotypes representing diverse cultivated genotypes, wild species of Cajanus and inter-specific derivatives (Figure 2, Additional file 5). In total, 125 different
DNA fragments with an average of 6.25 alleles per locus
were amplified among the 30 genotypes. The number of
alleles per SSR marker ranged from 4 for ASSR66 to 10
for ASSR3, whereas the PIC values ranged from 0.46 to
0.72 with an average of 0.63 per marker. As expected, a
higher average number of alleles and PIC values were
observed for the wild species (4.1 alleles per locus and
0.72 PIC value) compared to those for C. cajan cultivars
(3.75 alleles per locus and 0.49 PIC value) (Table 4). Jaccard’s similarity coefficients were calculated for pair-wise
combinations of all the genotypes and a dendrogram was
constructed to resolve the members of the primary, secondary and tertiary gene pools in the two main groups
(Figure 3). Cluster I corresponded to the primary gene
pool, including all the C. cajan cultivars in sub-cluster
Ia 1 , while sub-cluster Ia 2 was represented by a single
entry Rhynchosia aurea. Cluster Ib included two genotypes of C. platycarpus, suggesting that it is closer to C.
cajan than C. cajanifolius. Intra sub-cluster similarity in
Cluster I ranged from 16.5% to 52%. Cluster II included

the remaining five wild species of the secondary and tertiary gene pool (Figure 3). Cluster II was divided into two
sub-clusters IIa and IIb, at a cut-off similarity index of
26%. The three wild species, namely R. aurea, C. platycarpus 1 and 2, showed close relatedness to C. cajan cultivars but were in the tertiary gene pool due to low
crossability with cultivated pigeonpea. Among the
C. cajan cultivars, three pairs- PCMF40/PCMF43-7, Pusa
9/Kudarat and PS 971/PS 956 showed the highest similarity (52%).
In silico analysis of SSR polymorphism between
Asha and UPAS 120

One aim of the present investigation was in silico identification of SSR polymorphism between pigeonpea varieties Asha and UPAS 120 for the development of an
EST-based intra-species reference genetic map. TSA
contigs were first assembled separately for Asha and
UPAS 120 using the 454-Newbler assembler and then
aligned together using Lasergene SeqMan Pro™ Version
8.0.12 software to obtain the SSR size differences
between Asha and UPAS 120 varieties. A total of 1,484
SSR loci were present in the 17,305 TSA contigs common to Asha and UPAS 120. Only 318 of these loci
were type I SSR (n ≥ 20 bp) of which 47 were
polymorphic between Asha and UPAS 120 with size differences of 2-15 bp based on the in silico alignments.
Further, only 24 of these loci showed allelic size differences of ≥4 bp, which is considered amenable for analysis on gel electrophoresis. For wet laboratory validation
of polymorphism we chose these 24 SSR loci and designated them as ASSR1 to ASSR24. Four of the markers
(ASSR4, ASSR6, ASSR18, ASSR22) did not amplify any
PCR product, one marker (ASSR21) showed a larger

than expected product size, while nine markers amplified but did not show distinct polymorphism on agarose
gel electrophoresis perhaps due to small product size
difference (average 4.8 bp difference), or actual lack of
polymorphism. The remaining 10 primers (ASSR1, 3, 8,
9, 12, 13, 15, 17, 19, 23) showed distinct size polymorphism between Asha and UPAS 120 as expected
from the in silico analysis (average 7 bp difference).
Figure 4 presents such an example with ASSR8, where
agarose gel electrophoresis confirmed the expected 15
bp size difference between Asha and UPAS120 and a
Mendelian segregation ratio of 1:2:1 in the F2 mapping
population derived from the cross between Asha and
UPAS 120. Thus, 40% of the 24 in silico identified polymorphic SSR loci were validated successfully by wet
laboratory analysis.

Discussion
Conventional breeding of pigeonpea has continued
entirely without the aid of molecular methods and made
limited use of germplasm resources, resulting in a very
narrow genetic base in the domesticated species. As a
consequence, pigeonpea genetic improvement programs
have made relatively little progress in addressing the
primary constraints to crop production, which include a
range of abiotic (e.g. drought, salinity and waterlogging) and biotic (e.g. Fusarium wilt, sterility mosaic
disease and pod boring insect Helicoverpa armigera)
stresses. With the advent of next generation sequencing
technologies several crop legumes have recently been
subjected to intensive analyses, making marker-assisted
breeding a reality [30]. Margulis et al. [31] demonstrated a 100-fold sequencing capability with 454 GSFLX pyrosequencing but with relatively lower accuracy

at the homopolymer positions than Sanger-based capillary electrophoresis sequencing. We used 454 GS-FLX
pyrosequencing to develop an extensive collection of
expressed sequence reads from two parental pigeonpea
cultivars and mined and validated a comprehensive set
of genic-SSR markers.
A total of 1.696 million high quality sequence reads
were assembled to generate 43,324 TSA unigene contigs,
which together represented a large fraction of the
pigeonpea transcriptome and helped develop a comprehensive set of genic-SSR markers. Application of a subset of these markers in pigeonpea was sufficient to
assess the genetic diversity among cultivars and position
domesticated accessions relative to related species and
genera. These markers represent a significant addition
to the limited set of genic-SSR markers available in
pigeonpea [16-20].
Only 81.8% of the SSR-containing unigene sequences
showed significant hits in the NCBI non-redundant protein database. This may be due to: (i) EST fragments
sequenced directly instead of after cloning; this leads to
truly random sequencing of all the expressed genes that
may facilitate the discovery of new rare transcripts as
evidenced by Emrich et al. [32]; or (ii) unique contigs
being part of a consensus sequence representing
3’-UTRs; C-termini or 3’ sequences which are often less
conserved than other transcript regions [33].
The deep transcriptome sequence data allowed the
discovery of a set of 3,771 perfect SSR loci of ≥10 bp
length in pigeonpea. About 7.6% of the pigeonpea TSA
unigene contigs possessed at least one SSR- similar to
previously reported SSR prevalence in the ESTs of
wheat (7.41%), higher than grapes (2.5%), barley (2.8%)
and flax (3.5%), but lower than coffee (18.5%)
[22,34-37]. The genic-SSR frequency also depended on
the parameters used in exploring SSR markers, e.g. the
repeat length and number of repeat unit thresholds. The
abundance of genic-SSR (kbp/SSR) in pigeonpea was 8.4
compared to 3.4 in rice, 5.4 in wheat, 7.4 in soybean,
11.1 in tomato, 14.0 in Arabidopsis, and 20.0 in cotton
[37,38]. Differences in genic-SSR abundance could be
partly due to the size of the EST unigene assembly dataset and use of different search criteria and data mining
tools [21]. Frequency distribution of EST-SSR motifs in
our study was not comparable with earlier work on
pigeonpea by Raju et al. [20] because we developed TSA
unigene contigs using FLX-454 sequencing, instead of
Sanger sequencing. The number of SSRs identified in
the present study was 3,771 from 43,324 unigene
sequences, whereas Raju et al. described 3,583 SSRs
from only 5,508 unigenes. The main reason for the
overestimation of SSR frequency by Raju et al. is the
inclusion of compound SSRs and homopolymers which
are the most frequent repeats.

Page 8 of 13

Dinucleotide SSR loci were most frequent in the
pigeonpea TSA contigs analyzed here, representing
60.41% of the SSR loci identified, i.e. about double that
of the trinucleotide SSR loci (34.52%), the second most
abundant motifs. This was in agreement with the genicSSR distribution reported in peach, pumpkin, spruce,
coffee and kiwifruit, where dinucleotide repeats are
most frequent [39-42]. However, this is in contrast to a
number of earlier reports showing trinucleotides as the
most abundant class of SSR loci in ESTs [22,35,43-47].
A possible explanation for the high frequency of dinucleotide SSR loci in pigeonpea TSA is that these include
large amounts of information representing UTRs due to
deep transcriptome sequencing. Yu et al. [48] reported
19% of dinucleotide repeats in the coding region and
81% in the 5’- and 3’-UTRs, whereas 74% of the trinucleotide repeats were in the coding regions and only
26% in UTRs. Among the 550 validated SSR loci with
n≥18 bp in the present study, only 97 (17.6%) were
dinucleotide repeats and 56 were in the UTR. Most of
the dinucleotide SSR loci showed a smaller size range of
10-12 bp (Additional file 2). Our study also showed that
the overall proportion of polymorphic SSR markers was
much higher in UTRs compared to the coding regionthere were 40 polymorphic SSR markers in UTRs (11 in
5’-UTR and 29 SSR in 3’-UTR), whereas only 31 were
polymorphic in the coding region, despite 61.7% of all
amplified SSR markers being located in the coding
region. This is due to the tendency of sequence conservation in the coding regions.
Only 80% of the 772 tested SSR primers amplified the
target pigeonpea genomic DNA. The success rate is
comparable to barley, where 67-70% of the primers
amplified [43,34], but higher than sugarcane (48.5%) and
lower than flax (92.2%) [35,49]. A possible explanation
for the lack of amplification could be flanking primers
extending across a splice site with a large intron or chimeric cDNA contigs [34]. Although the majority (519
numbers) of the designed SSR markers amplified a single expected product size at the annealing temperature
of 55°C, we optimized the annealing temperature of 31
additional primers to maximize the availability of genicSSR markers for pigeonpea.
Generally genic-SSR markers show a lower level of
polymorphism than genomic-SSR markers [22,50-52],
but in this study the use of type I genic-SSR markers
showed a high level of polymorphism. Previous diversity
studies with pigeonpea species using genomic-SSR markers reported an average of 3.1-4.9 alleles per locus with
average PIC values of 0.41-0.52 [15,17-19]. An earlier
study with genic-SSR markers in pigeonpea reported the
average number of alleles per marker as 4 and an average PIC value of 0.40 [20]. We observed a higher average of 6.25 alleles per locus and an average PIC value of

Dutta et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:17
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/17

0.63 by using type I genic-SSR markers. The possible
reasons are: (i) choice of 20 highly polymorphic SSR
markers for the diversity assessment on 30 genotypes
after initial testing of 550 markers on eight varieties; (ii)
higher depth of coverage generated by the 454 GS-FLX
sequencing technology that produced larger sequence
contigs including UTRs which are more polymorphic;
(iii) use of a diverse genotype set including interspecific
derivatives and wild Cajanus species for diversity assessment. Contrary to other plant species where dinucleotide repeats showed high polymorphism [33,43,46],
hexanucleotide repeats were highly polymorphic
(38.57%) in pigeonpea genic-SSR markers, followed by
pentanucleotides (29.14%) and trinucleotides (15.25%).
Larger repeats have been linked to a higher degree of
polymorphism in earlier studies [25,53]; we also found
the maximum polymorphism with 40-50 bp SSR length
on agarose gel electrophoresis.
On the basis of SSR polymorphism, cluster analysis
and earlier diversity studies involving RFLP, AFLP,
RAPD, SSR and DArT markers, it is concluded that
genetic diversity in the pigeonpea gene pool is very low
[11-20]. The genic-SSR markers reported here open up
new opportunities to assess the genotypic diversity in
the pigeonpea germplasm. Most of the earlier reported
SSR markers in pigeonpea are of genomic origin except
for 84 genic-SSR markers reported recently [20]. This
study is the first report a comprehensive set of genicSSR markers for pigeonpea.
Wild species of crop plants are placed in different
gene pools based on their crossability with the cultivated
species. Closely related and easily crossable species are
placed in the primary or secondary gene pools, whereas
species which are distantly related and are incompatible
with the cultivated species, are placed in a tertiary gene
pool. Species in the primary and secondary gene pools
can be readily utilized for varietal improvement. In this
study, the “unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean” (UPGMA)-based cluster analysis grouped
the genotypes according to their gene pool. The variability within the C. cajan cultivars which easily cross-hybridize among themselves formed the primary gene pool
(Cluster I), whereas four species that have poor crossability with the C. cajan formed the secondary gene
pool (Cluster II). Sub cluster Ib (C. platycarpus 1 and 2)
and sub-sub cluster Ia2 (R. aurea) included species from
the tertiary gene pool even though they were closely
related to C. cajan based on the marker analysis. The
varieties of C. cajan showed different levels of similarity,
e.g. PCMF 40 and PCMF 43-7, both inter-specific derivatives belonging to the short maturity group, shared
52% similarity between them and 40% similarity with
PCMF 39-1 having similar pedigree. Likewise, short
duration variety pair (PS-971/PS-956) and long duration

Page 9 of 13

variety pair (Pusa-9/Kudarat) were closer to each other
than varieties belonging to different maturity groups.
Genotypes of secondary and tertiary gene pools
clustered separately into two sub-clusters. R. aurea and
C. platycarpus belong to the tertiary gene pool due to
poor crossability with the cultivated pigeonpea, but they
showed genetic similarities with C. cajan. These results
are also supported by Raju et al. [20] who used 15
EST-SSRs to study the genetic diversity of 32 cultivars
and eight accessions of two Cajanus species C. platycarpus and C. scarabaeoides. Earlier, a close relationship
was reported between C. cajanifolius and C. cajan using
genomic SSR markers [17,19], but our study based on
genic-SSR markers showed that C. cajanifolius is more
distant to C. cajan compared to C. platycarpus. UPAS
120, TTB 7, Pusa Dwarf and Bahar genotypes belonging
to different maturity groups were part of a single cluster.
Genotypes of secondary and tertiary gene pools clustered
separately in two sub-clusters, but R. bracteata which
belongs to the tertiary gene pool based on the crossability
criteria clustered with genotypes of the secondary gene
pool. The closeness between Cajanus and Rhynchosia is
also supported by morphological and genetic evidence, i.
e. the presence of strophiole, an important characteristic
used to distinguish between the genera. Seeds of Cajanus
and Rhynchosia are generally described without strophioles. Various species of Rhynchosia, even though
genetically closer to Cajanas, fail to produce hybrids
because of reproductive barriers, and therefore Rhynchosia and Cajanus are classified as separate genera. High
resolution mapping of these genotypes using a large
number of genomic markers for diversity analysis may
provide different results because genic-SSRs represent
the transcribed portion of the genome, while the repetitive heterochromatin portion of the genome plays a
major role in the evolution of species [54].
This is the first report of development and validation
of a comprehensive set of genic-SSR markers in pigeonpea by deep transcriptome sequencing using next generation sequencing technology. A set of 2,877 genic-SSR
markers was developed, and 550 SSR markers from this
were validated for robust amplification in eight pigeonpea varieties, that will be useful for diversity analysis as
well as mapping and tagging of genes and quantitative
trait loci for economically important traits in pigeonpea.

Conclusions
A dataset of 43,324 TSA unigene contigs derived from
1.69 million 454 GS-FLX sequence reads of two pigeonpea varieties was produced. A comprehensive set of
2,877 genic-SSR markers was developed and 550 of
these were validated for amplification and polymorphism, which will be useful for the development of molecular maps based on genic markers. Of the 550,

Dutta et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:17
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/17

20 highly polymorphic markers identified all the individuals of a set of 30 genotypes including cultivars and
wild species. Due to conservation of genic sequences
these markers have a higher chance of transferability
across species, compared to genomic SSR markers
which show high polymorphism but are less conserved
between species. A combination of these genic-SSR
markers, single nucleotide polymorphism markers being
mined from the TSA contigs assembled in this study
and genomic SSR markers developed in other laboratories will be a powerful resource for molecular taxonomic studies and construction of a reference molecular
map of the pigeonpea genome. Since genic-SSR markers
belong to the gene-rich regions of the genome, some of
these can be exploited for use in marker-assisted breeding of pigeonpea. Therefore, the set of genic-SSR markers developed here is a promising genomic resource.

Methods
Plant materials

Root, leaf, stem and immature seeds from two pigeonpea
varieties, namely Asha and UPAS 120, were used for RNA
extraction and transcriptome sequencing. The 30 genotypes used for validation of SSR markers and diversity analysis included members of primary (20 cultivars of C.
cajan), secondary (C. albicans, C. cajanifolius, C. lineatus,
C. sericeus) and tertiary (C. platycarpus, R. aurea, R. bracteata) gene pools. The genotypes were originally obtained
from IARI, New Delhi, ICRISAT Hyderabad, IIPR Kanpur,
CCSHAU Meerut, JNKVV Jabalpur, GAU S.K. Nagar, and
maintained at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute,
New Delhi (Additional file 5).
RNA extraction and cDNA sequencing

Plant RNA was isolated using the modified CTAB
method [55]. One gram of frozen leaf, root, stem or
immature seed tissue was separately ground in liquid
nitrogen and mixed with 15 ml of extraction buffer (100
mM Tris-HCL (pH 8), 2% CTAB, 30 mM EDTA, 2 M
NaCl, 0.05% spermidine, 2% polyvinylpolypyrrolidinone
(PVP) and 2% 2-mercaptoethanol. The homogenate was
incubated at 65°C for 10 min and extracted with chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (24:1), and RNA precipitated with
12 M LiCl. After washing with 70% ethanol the RNA
pellet was dissolved in diethylpyrocaronate (DEPC) treated water. Equimolar concentrations of extracted RNA
from the four different tissues of each variety were
mixed to create two RNA pools and sent to Roche for
454 GS-FLX sequencing.
Development of genic-SSR markers and in silico analysis
of parental polymorphism

Expressed sequence reads were generated by deep transcriptome sequencing from two sets of normalized

Page 10 of 13

cDNA libraries. High quality filtered sequence reads
were obtained by 454 GS-FLX sequencing, and sequence
contigs were generated for the two varieties separately
by de novo assembly using 454 ‘Newbler’ assembler.
Sequence data for C. cajan Short Read Archive (SRA)
described in this paper can be found in the public database (Ac. no. SRP002556, SRP002557). A non-redundant
set of unigene sequences was created by further alignments of the Newbler contigs from the two varieties
using Lasergene SeqMan Pro™ Version 8.0.12 assembler
with default parameters to develop 43,324 unigene contigs. This unigene set was used for mining genic-SSR
markers and primer design using BatchPrimer3 v1.0
software [26,27]. In this study, the SSR loci containing
perfect repeat units of 2-6 nucleotides only were considered. The minimum SSR length criteria were defined as
five reiterations for each repeat unit. Mononucleotide
repeats and complex SSR types were excluded from the
study.
The parameters for designing primers from the SSR
flanking sequences were: primer length range of 20-25
bases with an optimum of 22 bases; PCR product size
range of 100-200 bp; optimum annealing temperature
of 50-60°C; GC content of 40-60% with an optimum
of 50%; the specified number of consecutive Gs and
Cs at the 3’ end of both primers was one. Other parameters were at the default setting of BatchPrimer3
v1.0 [26].
We also performed in silico analysis of parental polymorphism for SSR loci present in the 17,305 TSA contigs common to Asha and UPAS 120. Type I SSR loci
with n≥20 bp were targeted and pair-wise alignment of
these contigs was inspected manually to identify SSRs
with a minimum size difference of 4 bp between Asha
and UPAS 120. Primers were synthesized for the 24 SSR
loci with size difference of ≥4 bp for validation by PCR
amplification and agarose gel electrophoresis as
described below.
Plant DNA extraction, genotyping and annotation
of gene function

Genomic DNA was isolated from leaf samples of 30
genotypes (Additional file-2) according to the CTAB
method [56], quantified by UV 260 absorbance and
adjusted to a final concentration of 30 ng/μl. All the 772
genic-SSR loci with SSR lengths of 18 bp or longer were
first tested for amplification using genomic DNA from
Asha for optimization of the annealing temperature.
The PCR reactions were performed using PTC225 Gradient Cycler (MJ Research). Each PCR reaction consisted
of 1.5 μl of 10x reaction buffer, 0.20 μl of 10 mM
dNTPs (133 μM), 1.5 μl each of forward and reverse
primers (10 pmol), and 2.5 μl of template genomic
DNA (75 ng), 0.15 μl of Taq DNA polymerase

(0.75 U) Vivantis Technologies) in a final reaction
volume of 15 μl. The PCR reaction profile was: DNA
denaturation at 94°C for 5 min. followed by 35 cycles
of 94°C for 1 min., 55°C for 1 min., 72°C for 1 min.
and finally, 72°C for a final extension of 7 min.
Re-screening of primers that did not amplify at these
conditions was done by decreasing the annealing temperature sequentially by 1°C, and for the primers producing multiple bands, by increasing the annealing
temperature by 1°C. The optimized SSR primers were
then used for PCR amplification in eight varieties of
pigeonpea. The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis in 4% Metaphor agarose gels (Lonza,
Rockland ME USA) containing 0.1 μg/ml ethidium
bromide in 1x TBE buffer at 130 V for 4 h. After electrophoresis, PCR products were visualized and photographed using gel documentation system Fluorchem™
5500 (Alfa Innotech Crop., USA). The TSA sequences
containing 550 SSRs were used for gene prediction using
gene finding software MolQuest (FGENESH+) [57]. The
position of SSRs was then analyzed for their exact location
in the gene with respect to the open reading frame. To
annotate the putative functions of the genes containing
550 validated SSRs, their unigene sequences were compared by BLASTX tool of NCBI at a cutoff bit score of 50
against the non-redundant protein database.
SSR marker scoring and data analysis

The genotype profiles produced by SSR markers were
scored manually. Each allele was scored as present (1) or
absent (0) for each of the SSR loci. A total of 550 genicSSR markers giving consistent expected size products
were used for genotyping eight pigeonpea varieties; and 20
highly polymorphic loci of these were used for the diversity analysis on 30 genotypes. Markers that produced
expected size of amplicons (100-200 bp) were scored for
variation in amplicon size and the data analyzed for PIC
using the formula described by Botstein et al. [58].
PIC = 1 − ∑ Pi 2

Where, Pi is the frequency of the ith allele in the set
of genotypes analyzed, calculated for each SSR locus.
The genetic similarity between any two genotypes was
estimated based on Jaccard’s similarity coefficient.
All the 30 genotypes were clustered with the UPGMA
analysis and SAHN procedure of the NTSYS-PC
v2.10t [59].
