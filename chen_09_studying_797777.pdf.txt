Alternative splicing regulatory between exons and their regulators or targets and between co-spliced exons in human, mouse and rat pro-

Abstract
Background: Alternative pre-mRNA splicing is an important gene regulation mechanism for
expanding proteomic diversity in higher eukaryotes. Each splicing regulator can potentially
influence a large group of alternative exons. Meanwhile, each alternative exon is controlled by
multiple splicing regulators. The rapid accumulation of high-throughput data provides us with a
unique opportunity to study the complicated alternative splicing regulatory network.
Results: We propose the use of partial correlation analysis to identify association links between
exons and their upstream regulators or their downstream target genes (exon-gene links) and links
between co-spliced exons (exon-exon links). The partial correlation analysis avoids taking the ratio
of two noisy random variables, exon expression level and gene expression level, so that it achieves
a higher statistical power. We named this analysis procedure pCastNet (partial Correlation analysis
of splicing transcriptome Network). Through studies of known alternative exons, conservation
patterns, relative positions, functional annotations, and RT-PCR experiments, we concluded that
pCastNet can effectively identify exon-gene or exon-exon links. We further found that gene pairs
with exon-gene or exon-exon links tend to have similar functions or are present in the same
pathways. More interestingly, gene pairs with exon-gene or exon-exon links tend to share ciselements in promoter regions and microRNA binding elements in 3' untranslated regions, which
suggests the coupling of co-alternative-splicing, co-transcription-factor-binding, and co-microRNAbinding.
Conclusions: Alternative splicing regulatory networks reconstructed by pCastNet can help us
better understand the coordinate and combinatorial nature of alternative splicing regulation. The
proposed tool can be readily applied to other high-throughput data such as transcriptome
sequencing data.

Background

Alternative pre-mRNA splicing is an important gene regulation mechanism for expanding proteomic diversity in higher

eukaryotes. It has been estimated that 59-74% of human
genes are alternatively spliced [1,2], and abnormal mRNA
splicing contributes to many human diseases [3-5]. The alter-

native splicing of multiple pre-mRNAs is tightly regulated
and coordinated, which is an essential component for many
biological processes, including nervous system development
and programmed cell death [6,7]. In the process of alternative
splicing, splicing regulators bind to various pre-mRNAs and
affect a large number of exons. Meanwhile the splicing pattern of a specific exon is determined by multiple pre-mRNAbinding proteins [8,9]. Therefore, it will be particularly interesting to study how the splicing of a group of exons is co-regulated and how the splicing of an exon is combinatorially
controlled by multiple regulators.
With advancements in high-throughput technologies, such as
Affymetrix exon arrays, various types of junction arrays, or
high-throughput sequencing, it is feasible to study alternative
splicing on a genomic scale. Current studies have centered on
the differential analysis of alternative splicing. To identify
exons with differential splicing, we must account for differential transcription of a gene itself. In Affymetrix exon arrays,
both exon-level intensity and gene-level intensity are estimated. Gene-level-normalized exon intensity, which is
defined as the ratio of the exon intensity to the gene intensity,
has been widely used to remove the transcription effect when
studying splicing. A significant difference in the normalized
exon intensity (NI) indicates that this exon has different
inclusion or exclusion rates between two conditions. For
example, in ExACT, developed by Affymetrix [10,11], the NI is
calculated as the ratio of the exon intensity to the gene intensity. Then, the 'splicing index' value is calculated by taking the
log ratio of the NI in sample 1 to the NI in sample 2 to identify
exons alternatively spliced between two samples.
Multiple groups have nicely surveyed the complexities of
alternative splicing in various tissues and cell lines and
observed tissue-specific alternative splicing events mainly
through differential analysis [1,11,12]. These events are valuable for investigating the function of alternative splicing in
phenotypic diversity. However, their regulatory interactions
remain largely unknown; for example, one can hardly speculate on the relationship or the regulators of two exons coenriched in a specific tissue. In combination with motif analysis, one can further study motif enrichment in a group of tissue-specific alternative exons [13,14]. However, such analysis
is constrained by the limited knowledge of splicing regulators
and their cis-regulatory motifs. The motifs of some splicing
regulators have not yet been identified and some RNA binding proteins have almost identical binding motifs. Except for
a few splicing factors (for example, FOX proteins), the degenerative nature of binding motifs of splicing regulators further
confounds analysis. Several groups have used microarrays in
conjunction with manipulation of splicing regulator expression or crosslinking immunoprecipitation (CLIP) of splicing
regulators to identify their indirect or direct targets [15,16].
Such studies provide the most valuable data for dissecting
alternative splicing regulation centered on one splicing regulator of interest.

Instead of performing differential analysis, we propose to
study alternative splicing regulatory networks based on pairwise co-expression associations of exons and genes across
multiple conditions. This can provide a direct association link
between two exons or between one exon and one gene. Such
association links can be used to infer regulatory or functional
relationships between two nodes. In this study, we have used
exon array data for human, mouse, and rat across 11 tissues to
study alternative splicing regulatory networks. To study the
co-splicing patterns of exons, we can intuitively calculate the
NI for every exon across multiple conditions and then calculate the correlation between the NIs of two exons. However,
the high-level of noise inherent to exon arrays will make the
correlation unstable. Indeed, some studies using the NI
approach have reported low validation rates (21-56%) for the
identification of alternative splicing events [10,17,18]. The
possible reason is that the distribution of the ratio of two random variables is often heavy-tailed if the noise level for the
two random variables is high [19]. In other words, if the noise
level is high, the ratio between the exon intensity and the gene
intensity is not stable and it remains a special statistical challenge to derive appropriate test statistics. For example, we
considered a constitutive exon and the gene it belongs to.
Exon-level and gene-level intensities were simulated according to a bivariate normal distribution. The correlation
between the exon-level intensity and the gene-level intensity
was set as 0.9 to satisfy that the exon is a constitutive exon. A
total of 1,000 expression levels were simulated. As shown in
Additional data file 1, when the noise level is high, the NI can
be as small as 0.5 or as high as 3 even if the exon is a constitutive exon.
Instead of using the ratio between the exon intensity and the
gene intensity, we can perform correlation studies on the
exon intensity directly. To remove the transcription effect in
the exon intensity, we propose to apply partial correlation
analysis. A partial correlation coefficient is the correlation
between two variables, with the effects of other variables
removed. For example, in order to exclude the possibility that
a high exon-exon (EE) correlation is due to either the genelevel association or the association between one exon and the
gene that the other exon belongs to, we calculate the partial
correlation coefficients between the two exons conditioning
on one or two genes. If the partial correlations are still high,
we declare that there is an association between the two exons
and this association represents a co-splicing relationship. In
addition to EE co-splicing links, we also studied exon-gene
(EG) links where the high correlation between an exon and a
gene is not due to the gene-gene (GG) association. Partial correlation analysis has been applied to gene co-expression network studies [20-22].
In this study we have used exon array data for human, mouse,
and rat across 11 tissues. The proposed methods can be readily applied to RNA-Seq data. We want to point out that the cosplicing relationship can be condition-specific. With the rapid

accumulation of high-throughput exon array or RNA-Seq
data, we will be able to reconstruct dynamic regulatory networks under different conditions in the near future.

Results
Determining gene-gene, exon-gene and exon-exon
links using pCastNet
Three types of associations were considered for a pair of gene:
GG, EG, and EE associations. Using pCastNet (partial Correlation analysis of splicing transcriptome Network), the Pearson correlation coefficient for GG associations was calculated
between gene 1 (g1) and gene 2 (g2) and denoted as rg 1 g 2 . For
EG associations, considering an exon (e1) of gene 1 (g1) and
gene 2 (g2), as well as the Pearson correlation coefficient

each pair of exons belonging to different genes were calculated as re 1 e 2 , re 1 e 2 • g 1 , re 1 e 2 • g 2 , and re 1 e 2 • g 1 g 2 . In the NIbased approach, the correlation between the NI values of each
pair of exons across ten tissues was calculated as r. Different
p-value thresholds were used to declare whether there is a cosplicing relationship between two exons. Figure 1 shows the
ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curves of pCastNet
(red) and the NI-based approach (black). Three scenarios
were considered: the standard deviation of the exon intensity
is 1 (circles), 2 (triangles), or 4 (crosses). pCastNet consistently performed better than the NI-based approach. When
the variance of the exon intensity is large (22 or 42), the power
(true positive rate) of pCastNet is almost 50-100% higher
than that of the NI-based approach given the same false positive rate. The true positive rates and the false positive rates
are the average values across 1,000 simulations for each scenario.

The choice of significance threshold remains a major challenge for co-expression network studies. Previous studies
have typically relied on a data-independent constant correlation threshold. Zhang and Horvath [23] proposed a weighted
gene co-expression network approach. They used soft thresholding instead of hard thresholding to better identify GG
links. This method needs a scale-free topology criterion to
estimate the involved parameters. Other topology-based
approaches include clustering coefficient-based threshold
selection developed by Elo et al [24]. Because there has been
little study on the topology of alternative splicing regulatory
networks, we avoided topology-based methods and instead
propose a false discovery rate (FDR) approach. Specifically,
we used the approach proposed by Efron [25] to control the
expected FDR conditioning on a dependence effect parameter
A. For GG, EG, and EE networks, hypotheses were performed
to test the significance of pair-wise correlations. The dependence among hypotheses is largely ignored in traditional FDR
control methods [26,27], despite the fact that correlations
among hypotheses may be high for genomics studies [28]. In
contrast, the conditional false discovery expectation takes the
dependence of hypotheses into account and, therefore,
achieves a more accurate estimate of FDR. For GG links, t-test

high, the association between e1 and g2 is not due to the correlation between g1 and g2. Otherwise, e1 can be a constitutive
exon of g1 and the association between e1 and g2 is due to the
correlation between the two genes. For EE associations, the
correlation between an exon (e1) of gene 1 (g1) and an exon
(e2) of gene 2 (g2) was calculated as re 1 e 2 . We also calculated
the partial correlations re 1 e 2 • g 1 , re 1 e 2 • g 2 and re 1 e 2 • g 1 g 2 to
exclude the possibility that the EE correlation is due to the EG
or GG correlation. In summary, if the p-value for rg 1 g 2 is significant, we declared a GG link between gene 1 and gene 2. If
the p-values for both re 1 g 2 and re 1 g 2 • g 1 are significant, we
declared an EG link between e1 and g2. This association is not
due to GG association. If the p-values for re 1 e 2 , re 1 e 2 • g 1 ,

re 1 e 2 • g 2 , and re 1 e 2 • g 1 g 2 are significant, we declared an EE
link between the two exons e1 and e2. The association is not
due to GG or EG associations.

Simulation studies on the performance of pCastNet
We performed simulation studies to illustrate the relative
performance of pCastNet. A total of five genes were considered. Each of them has five constitutive exons and one alternative exon. The five alternative exons have the same
inclusion rate relative to their gene levels. Thus, the five alternative exons are co-spliced. Exon intensity data were simulated for ten tissues. Gene-level intensity was estimated as the
average intensity of the five constitutive exons for each gene.
In pCastNet, the correlation and partial correlations between

re 1 e 2 • g 1 g 2 (n − 4) /(1 − re 1 e 2 •g 1 g 2 ) ) were first converted to z-

values. The distribution of the minimum absolute z-value was
estimated by a multivariate normal distribution; then, the
minimum absolute z-value was further transformed to final zvalues. Under the null hypotheses, the final z-values follow
the standard normal distribution. By comparing the histogram of z-values and the standard normal distribution, we
can estimate the dispersion parameter A that reflects the
dependence among hypotheses. Then we can calculate the
conditional FDR. However, the number of declared links is
very sensitive to the conditional FDR threshold (Table 1).
Therefore, instead of applying a threshold on the conditional
FDR directly, we estimated the sparseness of a network
according to the conditional FDR and then chose a threshold
on the sparseness. The sparseness of a network is defined as

the percentage of true links among all possible node pairs.
The threshold selection has several advantages: first, the corresponding correlation thresholds are data dependent; second, we can derive an accurate estimate of the number of
falsely declared links taking into consideration the dependence among hypotheses; and third, we can integrate prior
information about the sparseness of networks if this information is available. Here we chose the sparseness threshold as
0.02%; this threshold corresponds to a reasonable conditional FDR and total number of declared GG, EG, and EE
links. We also tried thresholds of 0.01% and 0.005%. The
results discussed in the remaining of this paper are similar,
although the number of links differs significantly (Table 1).

The sparseness is the percentage of true links among all possible node pairs. Note that the number of declared links is very sensitive to the
conditional FDR threshold. For example, for the GG network of human, when the conditional FDR (cFDR) changes from 4.42 to 4.61 (a 4%
increase), the number of GG links changes from 13,552 to 6,523 (a 48% decrease). Meanwhile, the sparseness is from 0.02% to 0.01% (a 50%
decrease).

Gene-gene, exon-gene and exon-exon links for human,
mouse and rat
To study alternative splicing regulatory networks, we considered exon array data for human, mouse, and rat. For each
organism, RNA samples from 11 tissues were profiled using
Affymetrix exon arrays. The raw data were downloaded from
the Affymetrix website [29] and the gene-level and the exonlevel expressions were summarized using Affymetrix Power
Tools.
GG association is the traditional GG co-expression association. EG association can be treated as the association between
an alternatively spliced exon and its upstream regulators or
its downstream target genes, which may not necessarily be
direct regulators or direct target genes. Sophisticated models
incorporating additional experiments (for example, CLIP
experiments) are needed to infer the direct regulators or targets. EE association can be treated as the association between
two alternatively spliced exons. The two exons could be regulated by the same direct or indirect splicing regulators.
Another scenario could be that a specific transcript isoform of
gene 1, which uniquely contains alternative exon 1 compared
to other transcript isoforms of gene 1, regulates the exon of

gene 2. The latter case is a special exon-transcript association
and 'transcript' here represents a particular transcript isoform instead of a family of gene splice variants. The above
possible regulation relationships for EG and EE links are diagrammed in Additional data file 2. Additional data file 3
shows the Venn diagram of gene pairs with GG, EG, or EE
associations. If GG links mainly reflect the transcriptional
regulatory network whereas EG and EE links mainly reflect
the alternative splicing regulatory network, it shows that
these two networks are largely independent of each other.

Annotated alternative exons tend to have more exongene and exon-exon links
If an exon has association links with other exons or genes and
such correlations are not due to the GG association, this exon
is expected to be an alternatively spliced exon. Otherwise, if
the exon is a constitutive exon that has a similar expression
level to its gene, the EE or EG correlation is due to the GG correlation. We are interested to know whether EG or EE links
can reflect the alternative splicing status of exons. Using the
human data as an example, non-redundant transcript annotations were assembled from 14 sources (see details in Materials and methods). These transcripts may be experimentally

Conservation of exons with exon-gene or exon-exon
links
It has been reported that the conservation level of alternative
exons is lower than that of constitutive exons [30]. On the
contrary, the intronic regions flanking alternative exons are
more conserved than those flanking constitutive exons
[30,31]. To assess whether exons with links to other exons (or
genes) tend to be alternatively spliced, we plotted the conservation scores of exons and their flanking regions (Figure 3).
Exons were divided into three groups: exons with node degree
= 0 (black lines); exons with node degree > 0 and the node
degree is in the top 10% of all non-zero node degrees (green
lines); exons with node degree > 0 and the node degree is not
in the top 10% list (red lines). Node degree is defined as the
number of links that a node has to other nodes in the network.
Here it represents the number of links that an exon has to

verified or just computationally predicted. Two groups of
exons were then assembled from the large pool of transcript
annotations: exons that are present in ≥ 14 transcript isoforms and are not spliced out in any transcript isoform; exons
that are present in ≥ 7 transcript isoforms and are spliced out
in another ≥ 7 transcript isoforms. The first exon group can be
treated as constitutive exons and the second exon group can
be treated as alternative exons. Figure 2 shows boxplots of the
EG and EE links that the two groups of exons have; exons in
group 2 clearly have more EG and EE links than exons in
group 1. Specifically, for exons in group 1, 12% have ≥ 5 EG
links and 11% have ≥ 50 EE links. For exons in group 2, the
percentages increase to 23% for EG links and 21% for EE
links. One-sided Wilcoxon tests show that exons in group 2
tend to have more EG and EE links with p-values < 2.2 × 10-16.

Conservation of exons with or without EG and EE links. For every site of an exon, x is defined as the position relative to the nearest splice site. It
is positive for distances from the 5' edge and negative for distances from the 3' edge. The upstream intronic region is from -100 to 0 bp and the
downstream intronic region is from 0 to 100 bp. Exons were divided into three groups: exons with node degree = 0 (black lines); exons with node degree
> 0 and the node degree is in the top 10% of all non-zero node degrees (green lines); exons with node degree > 0 and the node degree is not in the top
10% list (red lines). The y-axis is the average conservation score for the three exon groups. The error bar indicates the standard error of the mean for
each position.

other genes (EG) or exons (EE). The average PhastCons conservation score at each exon and flanking region position was
calculated and plotted for the three exon groups. Exons with
EG or EE links tend to be less conserved than exons without
EG or EE links. The flanking intronic regions of exons with
EG or EE links tend, however, to be more conserved than
those of exons without EG or EE links, which is possibly
related to the enriched cis-splicing regulatory elements in
intronic regions. The more links an exon has, the less it is conserved and the more its flanking intronic regions are conserved. For Affymetrix exon arrays, an exon may represent a
cluster of overlapping exons from transcript isoforms with
different 5' or 3' splicing sites. The boundary of such an exon
cluster may not be the real boundary of the exon in a cell. To
eliminate this bias, we removed exons with more than one
probe selection region (that is, exons with more than one pair
of splicing sites). The results are similar (data not shown).

Relative position of exons with exon-gene or exon-exon
links
The relative position from 5' to 3' was calculated for each
exon, ranging from 0 to 1. The relative positions were partitioned into 10 windows. The proportion of exons with relative
positions falling in each window was counted for exons with
or without EG (EE) links and denoted as p1 or p2, respectively.
Figure 4 plots the ratio between p1 and p2 for each relative
position window. It clearly shows that exons with EG or EE
links tend to be enriched in the initial or terminal regions.
Alternative promoters and alternative polyadenylation sites
are two of the most prevalent mechanisms for generating
transcript isoforms by including alternative first or last exons.
Recent studies suggest that 30-50% of human and approximately 50% of mouse genes have multiple alternative promoters [32-36]. In addition, about 54% of human and 32% of
mouse genes have alternative polyadenylation sites [37].
Exons with links to other genes or other exons are very likely
to be alternatively spliced. Many of them, therefore, are close
to the initial or the terminal regions of genes.

Enrichment of exons with EG or EE links at the termini of genes
Enrichment of exons with EG or EE links at the termini of genes. For each gene, all of the core exons were sorted according to their genomic
coordinates (from 5' to 3'). The relative position of the i-th exon is calculated as (i - 1)/(n - 1), where n is the total number of exons. The relative positions
were partitioned into ten windows. The proportion of exons with relative positions falling in each window was counted for exons with links and exons
without links and denoted as p1 or p2, respectively. The y-axis represents the p1/p2 ratio. Error bars represent the 95% confidence intervals of p1/p2.
Notice that p1/p2 is higher near the terminal regions.

Functional annotation analysis of hubs

Experimental validation

We assembled exons with node degrees ranking in the top 1%
in the EG network or the EE network. The DAVID functional
annotation tool [38] was used with genes to which hub exons
belong. The same was done for genes with node degrees ranking in the top 1% in the GG network. Table 2 lists the enriched
annotation terms with at least five gene counts, with p-values
after Bonferroni's correction ≤ 0.001, and that appear at least
twice in the nine groups (EG, EE, and GG for human, mouse,
and rat). Bonferroni's correction is a very stringent multiple
comparison correction. Here it restricts the probability of
having one or more falsely declared significant annotation
terms to ≤ 0.001. The term 'alternative splicing' is a UniProt
knowledgebase keyword meaning 'protein for which at least
two isoforms exist due to distinct pre-mRNA splicing events';
it is enriched in genes with hub exons for all of the EG and EE
networks. The Uniprot sequence feature 'splice variants' is
also enriched in these hub exons. However, 'alternative splicing' and 'splice variants' are not enriched in the gene hubs of
the GG networks.

We experimentally examined the pCastNet results by RTPCR across various tissues. In particular, the EE link is a relatively new correlation subject (in biology) and a very interesting phenomenon. We randomly chose EE links at the lower
bound of the correlation cut-off (about 0.75-0.80) but
favored cassette exons because of the ease of RT-PCR design.
Due to the nature of our data, we also favored genes that are
expressed in multiple tissues in order for PCR to amplify with
the same number of cycles across the tissues. pCastNet found
significant EE links among Kinesin-associated protein 3
(Kifap3) exon 20 (exon id 24930 in Affymetrix exon array),
Suppression of tumorigenicity 7 (St7) exon 7 (exon id
685163), and Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase
7 (Map3k7) exon 12 (exon id 572746). For convenience, we
refer to these exons as Kifap3_20, St7_7, and Map3k7_12.
Specifically, pCastNet predicted that Map3k7_12 has negative associations with both Kifap3_20 and St7_7 (correlations and partial correlations are about -0.75 for both),
whereas Kifap3_20 has a positive association with St7_7
(correlation and partial correlations are about 0.80). NCBI
EST database shows these exons are all alternative exons.
Primers were designed in the flanking constitutive exons to

The DAVID functional annotation tool was applied to genes whose exons are the hubs of EG networks, genes whose exons are the hubs of EE
networks, and genes that are the hubs of GG networks. The listed gene annotation terms have at least five gene counts, have p-values after
Bonferroni's correction ≤ 0.001, and appear at least twice in the nine groups (EG, EE, and GG for human, mouse, and rat). 'N' means the term is not
significant for this group. The annotation terms considered here are from the default settings. SP, SP_PIR_KEYWORDS where PIR means protein
information resource. UP, UP_SEQ_FEATURE, which means Uniprot sequence feature. BP, GOTERM_BP_ALL where BP means biological process.
CC, GOTERM_CC_ALL where CC means cellular component. MF, GOTERM_MF_ALL where MF means molecular function.

amplify transcripts either containing or skipping these alternative exons. RT-PCR results and Pearson correlation analysis of exon inclusion levels (Figure 5b) show that Map3k7_12
is negatively correlated with both Kifap3_20 and St7_7 while
Kifap3_20 is positively correlated with St7_7 in these tissues.
Besides the tissues surveyed in the exon array study, we also
performed RT-PCR experiments in seven other tissues (Figure 5d). Based on the RT-PCR experiments, the correlation
between Kifap3_20 and St7_7 is 0.60 and the correlation
between Map3k7_12 and St7_7 is -0.82 whereas the correlation between Map3k7_12 and Kifap3_20 dropped to -0.29.
Another example is a positive correlation between Solute carrier family 35, member B3 (Slc35b3) exon4 (exon id 226950,
or Slc35b3_4) and Retinoic acid induced 14 (Rail4) exon 11

(exon id 300782, or Rai14_11). pCastNet predicts a positive
association between these two exons (correlation and partial
correlations are about 0.80). RT-PCR and Pearson correlation analysis (Figure 5c) show a positive correlation of 0.75
among the tested tissues used by the Affymetrix exon array.
In the second set of tissues, RT-PCR experiments show that
their correlation is about 0.87 (Figure 5e). Note that Slc35b3
is not detectable in bladder, and thus has not been included in
the correlation analysis.

Functional similarity of gene pairs with links
All of the above results indicate that pCastNet can effectively
identify EG and EE links. We then further explored the possible functional relationship between two genes with an EG link

or an EE link. Using the human data and the Molecular Signatures Database [39], genes were grouped into gene sets
according to: their chromosome positions; curated information from pathway databases; shared conserved cis-regulatory motifs; and shared Gene Ontology (GO) terms. We tested
whether genes with EG or EE links tend to be in the same gene
sets using hypergeometric tests. The results are summarized
in Table 3. Genes in the same chromosomal cytogenetic band
('c1') are more likely to have GG and EG links than EE links.
Gene pairs with GG, EG, or EE links tend to be in the same
pathways (these pathways are collected by the BioCarta, GenMAPP, and KEGG databases). More interestingly, gene pairs
with EG or EE links tend to be in the same motif gene sets
('c3'). Specifically, genes in those sets share a motif in the promoter regions ('c3_promoter_known' and 'c3_promoter_un
known') or a microRNA (miRNA) binding site in the 3'
untranslated regions ('c3_miRNA'). On the contrary, the pvalues of GG links in the promoter motif sets are less significant than those of EG and EE links. And gene pairs with GG
links are not enriched in the 'miRNA binding' gene sets. In
addition, exons with EE links and sharing miRNA binding
motifs tend to be enriched at the 3' terminals of the genes
(Additional data file 4). Finally, genes with GG, EG or EE
links all tend to share GO terms.

Volume 10, Issue 1, Article R3

Chen and Zheng R3.11

We also examined p-values for the enrichment of links in each
individual gene set. We counted the number of GG, EG, or EE
links between members of a gene set for each gene set. To test
the significance of the enrichment of links, we simulated gene
sets by randomly selecting the same number of genes. The
simulated gene sets have no functional similarity. We then
calculated the empirical p-values of the number of observed
GG, EG or EE links as Pr (the number of links in the simulated
gene set ≥ the number of observed links) from 1,000 simulations. Figure 6 plots the histogram of the p-values of gene sets
with at least one observed GG, EG, or EE link. For all gene set
categories except category 1, there are more gene sets
enriched with GG, EG or EE links compared with the random
selections, where a uniform distribution of p-values is
expected.

Examples
The motif (U)GCAUG has been reported as a binding motif
for mammalian splicing factors FOX-1 (A2BP1) and FOX-2
(RBM9) [40-43]. We studied the enrichment of motif GCAUG
in exons with EG links to FOX-1 and FOX-2. For each exon,
we counted the occurrence of the pentamer GCAUG in the
exonic region and the flanking 200 bp intronic regions. Table
4 shows the enrichment of this motif for exons correlated with

Among the 10,366 human genes that were considered, there are 53,721,795 possible gene pairs. About 13,552 gene pairs were declared to have GG
links; 223,116 gene pairs were declared to have at least one EG link; and 815,024 gene pairs were declared to have at least one EE link. The number
of gene pairs that have GG, EG, or EE links and are in the same gene set is listed. The p-value of observing such a high or higher number of gene pairs
that have GG, EG, or EE links and are in the same gene set was based on a hypergeometric test. Different gene set categories were considered. 'c1',
genes sharing chromosomal cytogenetic bands; 'c2_BioCarta', 'c2_GenMAPP', and 'c2_KEGG', genes in the same pathways and the pathways were
collected from the BioCarta, GenMAPP, or KEGG databases; 'c3_miRNA', genes sharing a microRNA binding site; 'c3_promoter_known' and
'c3_promoter_unknown', genes sharing a motif in the promoter regions and the motif matches a known transcription factor binding site or the motif
does not match any known transcription factor binding site; 'c4_bp', genes sharing biological process ontology terms; 'c4_cc', genes sharing cellular
component ontology terms; 'c4_mf', genes sharing molecular function ontology terms.

Enrichment of GG, EG, or EE links in functional gene sets
Enrichment of GG, EG, or EE links in functional gene sets. For each gene set with at least one GG, EG, or EE link, to test the significance of the
enrichment of links, we simulated gene sets by randomly selecting the same number of genes as the tested gene set. The empirical p-value of the number
of observed links was calculated as Pr (the number of links in the simulated gene set ≥ the number of observed links) from 1,000 simulations. Histograms
of the p-values are plotted for those gene sets. The total number of test gene sets is listed on the histograms. C1: gene sets sharing a chromosomal
cytogenetic band. C2: gene sets curated from pathway databases. C3: gene sets sharing a conserved cis-regulatory motif. C4: gene sets sharing a GO term.

FOX-1 or FOX-2. The empirical p-values of the enrichment
were based on 1,000 simulated exon groups. Among the 64
exons correlated with FOX-1 in human, GCAUG occurs 96
times. And none of the 1,000 simulated exon groups has more
than 96 occurrences of GCAUG. The expression level of FOX1 and the inclusion rates of its associated exons are plotted in
Additional data file 5; this clearly shows the co-expression
patterns between FOX-1 and exons with EG links to FOX-1.
Although the p-values for FOX-2 in human (0.031) and Fox-1
and Fox-2 in mouse (0.172, 0.060) are less significant, the

occurrences of GCAUG are about twice as many as the average occurrence among the 1,000 simulated groups. Note that
after the filtering procedures for the raw data, FOX-1 and
FOX-2 are not in the final gene list for rat.
The calcium signaling pathway has been shown to be intensively related to alternative splicing [44]. In our gene set analysis, the KEGG calcium signaling pathway is enriched with
EG and EE links with empirical p-values of 0.01 and 0.001,
respectively. However, GG links are not enriched in the path-

are more powerful tools to identify direct causal links.
Although pCastNet does not provide as strong evidence as
CLIP studies for identifying downstream targets of splicing
factors, it infers other spaces of regulation, for example,
upstream regulatory genes besides the splicing factors of
interest. If one is interested in a specific signaling pathway
where multiple components can affect each other simultaneously, pCastNet can identify invaluable links to dissect the
regulatory relationship. As we show in the calcium signaling
pathway example, EE and EG links but not GG links are significantly enriched and the results provide clues to investigate
the functional and regulatory relationships between nodes. In
summary, pCastNet and differential study are complementary to each other and should be considered in combination to
better understand the network of interest.

In this paper, we propose the use of pCastNet to identify EE
co-splicing links and EG co-expression links. pCastNet avoids
taking the ratio between exon-level intensity and gene-level
intensity and it achieves a higher statistical power compared
to an NI-based approach (Figure 1). Such EG and EE links can
provide information about alternative splicing. For example,
alternative exons have significantly more EG or EE links than
constitutive exons (Figure 2). Secondly, exons with EG or EE
links tend to be less conserved in exonic regions than exons
without EG or EE links. On the contrary, the flanking intronic
regions of exons with EG or EE links tend to be more conserved than those of exons without EG or EE links (Figure 3).
Such observations are consistent with the conservation patterns of alternative exons and constitutive exons [30]. In
addition, exons with EG or EE links tend to be enriched in the
5' or 3' termini of genes where alternative splicing events are
enriched (Figure 4). The functional annotation analysis also
indicates that genes containing exon hubs of EG or EE networks tend to have multiple splicing isoforms (Table 2). All
the results indicate that the EG or EE links can reflect the
alternative splicing status of exons. Furthermore, they can
provide information about the alternative splicing regulatory
network.

We validated pCastNet predictions using RT-PCR experiments. No studies have reported the co-splicing of exons
Kifap3_20, St7_7, and Map3k7_12 nor reported on the functional relationships between Kifap3, St7, and Map3k7. Kifap3
is an auxiliary factor of the Kinesin family member 3 (Kif3)
heterotrimer complex that links KIF3 with its cargos [45].
Alternative splicing of Kifap3_20 generates two Kifap3 isoforms that differ in the carboxyl terminus region. St7 has been
reported to be a tumor suppressor gene involved in multiple
types of cancer [46]. In addition, Vincent et al. [47] reported
that St7 spans a translocation point in a patient with autism.
They also observed the alternative splicing of exon 7. Map3k7
is a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase that
transduces intracellular signals from the interleukin-1 receptor [48] and tumor necrosis factor receptor [49]. Kondo and
colleagues [50] reported strong biases of isoform (either
including or excluding Map3k7_12) ratios in some lung cancer specimens. Why and how the splicing of Kifap3_20,
St7_7, and Map3k7_12 are coordinated in some tissues is an
interesting question.

The alternative splicing regulatory network reconstructed by
pCastNet is composed of nodes (exon or gene) and their pairwise association links. It provides a different way to study
alternative splicing from previous differential analysis. Typical differential analysis compares two tissues or conditions;
for example, by studying differential alternative splicing
between tissues, one can identify a cluster of tissue-specific
alternative splicing events. By studying differential alternative splicing after the knockdown of splicing factors, one can
identify a cluster of target candidates of splicing regulators.
pCastNet considers multiple conditions at one time; by studying co-expression patterns of nodes across multiple conditions, we can identify pair-wise links between nodes. From
these links regulatory or functional relationships can be
inferred and they provide a comprehensive view of alternative
splicing regulation. However, links identified by the current
study are association links and not necessarily causal links.
The possible regulatory relationships they reflect can be
direct or indirect. CLIP based and knockdown experiments

The selection of samples or conditions will impact the identification and biological interpretation of links. Although we
had preferred to study a group of phenotypically relevant conditions (for example, different parts of the brain) to better
infer the biological meanings of links, there were limited data
available at the time of our study. As our data are from diverse
tissues, the network more likely identifies links shared by the
majority of the selected tissues. For example, pCastNet predicts a significant correlation between exon Slc35b3_4 and
exon Rai14_11. RT-PCR experiments have validated the correlation in tissues of brain, heart, liver, spleen, kidney, muscle, lung and testis (Figure 5c). Besides these eight tissues
surveyed by the Affymetrix exon array, we also considered a
different set of tissues not surveyed by the exon array study to
see if this correlation is a general pattern extendable to other
tissues. RT-PCR clearly shows the positive correlation among
eye, tongue, salivary gland, spinal cord, ovary and E16 cortex
(Figure 5e). This is consistent with the idea that due to the
sources of our data, links identified by pCastNet in the cur-

rent study tend to be a general phenomenon shared by multiple tissues. Another example is the pair-wise correlations
between the splicing of Kifap3_20, St7_7, and Map3k7_12 in
brain, heart, liver, spleen, kidney, muscle, lung and testis
(Figure 5b). For those seven additional tissues, Kifap3_20
and St7_7 are still positively associated, with a correlation of
0.60. Map3k7_12 and St7_7 are still negatively associated
with a correlation of -0.82. However, the negative correlation
between Map3k7_12 and Kifap3_20 decreases to -0.29 (Figure 5d). Therefore, although these exons are coordinately regulated in general, such a relationship remains contextdependent. If their correlation is directly caused by one or a
few alternative splicing regulators, we could surmise that the
tissue-specific expression of these splicing regulators and
their differential trans-activity strength on the three exons
confers the context-dependent correlation. Another explanation would be that the three exons have separate unique regulators besides the common regulators. The unique
regulators counteract the effects of common regulators and
are expressed in a tissue-specific manner. In the future, the
power of pCastNet will be extended by combining it with transcriptome differential analysis and RNA binding protein
motif analysis in order to elucidate the coordinate and combinatorial alternative splicing regulatory network.
We discovered the functional similarity of gene pairs with EG
or EE links. Strikingly, gene pairs with EG or EE links tend to
share a conserved sequence element in their promoter
regions. However, the p-values for gene pairs with GG links
are less significant. It has been reported and remains a puzzle
that, in mammals, the direct correlation between regulatory
cis-element similarity and expression similarity is not significant [51]. A second striking phenomenon is that gene pairs
with EG or EE links tend to share miRNA targets (Table 3).
However, the p-value for GG links is not significant, which is
consistent with the general concept that miRNAs mainly
affect protein translation but not transcript amounts in mammals. These results indicate the coupling of co-alternative
splicing, co-transcription factor binding, and co-miRNA
binding for a pair of genes. For example, genes sharing transcription factor binding sites may have co-regulated alternative promoters, which leads to the coupling of cotranscription-factor binding and co-alternative splicing.
Besides alternative promoters, downstream alternative exons
may also be involved in the coupling because alternative promoters have been reported to be correlated with downstream
alternative splicing [52-56]. Thus, the transcription factor
binding may be associated with the choice of promoters,
while the choice of promoter again is associated with the
inclusion or exclusion of a downstream alternative exon.
Another explanation is that the conserved sequence elements
could be RNA cis-elements for alternative splicing regulation
instead of DNA cis-elements for transcription regulation
because the considered promoter region is large (covering -2
kb to 2 kb around transcription start sites). Future work will
need to explore the detailed mechanisms. The enrichment of

EG and EE links for genes in the same pathways or having the
same GO terms also suggest that we can predict gene functions by considering neighboring genes in splicing regulatory
networks.
Several groups published a few sets of transcriptome data
from high-throughput sequencing techniques while this manuscript was under preparation. Such techniques improve the
accuracy of expression level measurement and increase the
efficiency of identifying novel alternative exons as exon junctions are sequenced. Our proposed methods can be directly
applied on transcriptome RNA-Seq data to identify EE and
EG links more accurately.

Conclusion

We propose a partial correlation analysis approach, pCastNet, to reconstruct EE and EG networks. EE and EG networks
are part of alternative splicing regulatory networks. We confirmed that pCastNet can effectively identify EG and EE links
through studying known alternative exons, conservation patterns, relative positions, and functional annotations, and by
RT-PCR experiments. We also found that genes with EG or
EE links with each other tend to have similar functions or are
in the same pathways, and genes with EG or EE links tend to
share cis-regulatory motifs in promoter regions and 3'
untranslated regions. Through these networks, we can gain a
better understanding of the role of alternative splicing in the
gene regulatory network.

Materials and methods
Exon array pre-processing
Exon array (Human Exon 1.0 ST, Mouse Exon 1.0 ST, Rat
Exon 1.0 ST) data for 11 tissues were downloaded from the
Affymetrix website [29]. The profiled tissues for human
include breast, cerebellum, heart, kidney, liver, muscle, pancreas, prostate, spleen, testis, and thyroid. The tissues for
mouse and rat include brain, embryo, heart, kidney, liver,
lung, muscle, ovary, spleen, testicle, and thymus. There are
three replicates for each tissue. The probe intensities were
quantile normalized and were adjusted based on the median
intensity of probes with similar GC content. The PLIER
method was used to summarize the probe-set-level intensity.
The iter-PLIER method was used to summarize the gene-level
intensity by iteratively calling PLIER with the core probe sets
(that is, RefSeq supported) that correlate with signal estimates. In the design of Affymetrix exon arrays, gene annotations from databases were projected onto the genome to infer
transcript clusters and exon clusters. A transcript cluster
roughly corresponds to a gene. In many cases, an exon cluster
represents a true biological exon and it acts as one probe
selection region. In other cases, an exon cluster represents the
union of multiple overlapping exons possibly due to alternative splice sites. Such exon clusters were further fragmented
into multiple probe selection regions according to the hard

edges (for example, splice sites). In exon array, hard edge was
defined as the end of the sequence that defines the boundary
of a probe selection region and cannot be extended beyond
the border by other annotation evidence. The probe set annotation, the transcript cluster annotation, and the exon annotation were downloaded form the Affymetrix website (version
hg18 for human, mm9 for mouse, and rn4 for rat) [29]. To
avoid knowledge bias, only core exons based on RefSeq transcripts or full-length mRNAs were considered. Note that 'core
probe sets' in Affymetrix exon arrays only means that they are
supported by RefSeq transcripts or full-length mRNAs; they
do not contain any information about whether they are alternative exons or constitutive exons.
Presence or absence of probe sets was determined by a 'detection above background' p-value threshold of 0.05. Genes with
more than 50% 'present' core probe sets were called 'present'.
The following filtering procedures were performed for probe
sets: remove probe sets that are not core probe sets; remove
probe sets whose genes are present in < 11 arrays out of 33
arrays (11 tissues × 3 replicates) or whose genes are mapped
to more than one Entrez gene ID; remove probe sets that are
present in < 11 arrays out of 33 arrays; remove probe sets with
(Maximum intensity)/(Minimum intensity) < 5. After the
above procedures, a total of 97,293 probe sets corresponding
to 76,038 exon clusters and 10,366 transcript clusters remain
for human; a total of 102,729 probe sets corresponding to
82,145 exon clusters and 10,765 transcript clusters remain for
mouse; and a total of 45,691 probe sets corresponding to
40,082 exon clusters and 5,077 transcript clusters remain for
rat. The average intensity across the three replicates was log2
transformed and used as the intensity level for each tissue.

Pearson correlation was calculated as re 1 g 2 . For EE associations, the Pearson correlation re 1 e 2 and the partial correlations re 1 e 2 • g 1 , re 1 e 2 • g 2 , and re 1 e 2 • g 1 g 2 were calculated
according to the above equations.

Simulation studies
In simulation studies, five genes were considered. Each of
them has five constitutive exons and one alternative exon.
The intensity data of the five constitutive exons of gene g (g =
1,..., 5) in tissue t (t = 1,..., 10) were simulated according to the
normal distribution N(μgt, σ2), where μgt is a value sampled
from the range 4 to 9 and it is different for different genes g
and different tissues t. All of the five alternative exons have
the same inclusion rate relative to their genes: (τ1, τ2,..., τ10) =
(0.1, 0.2,..., 1.0) for the 10 tissues. Thus, the intensity data of
the alternative exon of gene g was simulated according to the
normal distribution N(μgtτt, σ2). The gene-level intensity was
estimated as the average value of the constitutive exons.
pCastNet and the NI-based approach were conducted to calculate the correlations and partial correlations between exons
belonging to different genes. Three scenarios were considered
(σ = 1, 2, or 4). For each scenario, 1,000 simulations were performed and the average true positive rate and the average
false positive rate were calculated according to different correlation thresholds.

For GG associations, the test statistic:

G0(t) is the null cumulative distribution function for the t-values, Φ-1 is the inverse function of the cumulative distribution
function of standard normal, and n is the number of tissues
being surveyed. Under the null hypothesis that there is no
correlation between gene g1 and gene g2, t follows a Student t
distribution with degrees of freedom n - 2 and z follows the
standard normal distribution.
For EG association, the t values are:

RNA preparation and RT-PCR
Various tissues from adult C57BL mice and embryonic cortex
from E16 embryos were dissected and quickly submerged in
Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) followed by immediate tissue homogenization. Total RNA samples were prepared
according to manufacturer's protocol. RT-PCR was done as
previously described [30]. Primer design was done with the
Primer3 online software [58]. Primer sequences were.

array, if one exon of a transcript isoform locates in the exon
cluster region, the exon cluster is called 'present' in this transcript isoform. If the exon cluster locates in an intron region
of a transcript isoform, the exon cluster is called 'spliced out'
in this transcript isoform. Exon clusters (or exons for simplicity) were divided into two groups: exons that are present in ≥

The PhastCons conservation score [70] was downloaded from
the UCSC Genome Browser (hg18) [68]. The score of each site
is the posterior probability that the site is in the conserved
state of the phylogenetic hidden Markov model for 17 vertebrates.
For each gene with multiple exons, all of the core exons were
sorted according to their genomic coordinates (from 5' to 3').
The relative position of the i-th exon is calculated as (i - 1)/(n

Gene sets downloaded from the Molecular Signatures Database [39] belong to four categories: 'c1', positional gene sets
for each chromosomal cytogenetic band; 'c2', curated gene
sets from pathway databases; 'c3', motif gene sets sharing
conserved cis-regulatory motifs [71]; 'c4', GO gene sets sharing the same GO term. We removed gene sets without any

database, or the KEGG database. Category 3 was further
divided
into:
'c3_promoter_known'
and
'c3_promoter_unknown' - genes sharing a motif in the promoter regions (covering -2 kb to 2 kb around transcription
start sites) and the motif matches a known transcription factor binding site or the motif does not match any known transcription factor binding site; 'c3_miRNA' - genes sharing a
miRNA binding site. Category 4 was divided into: 'c4_bp' genes sharing biological process ontology terms; 'c4_cc' genes sharing cellular component ontology terms; 'c4_mf' genes sharing molecular function ontology terms.
