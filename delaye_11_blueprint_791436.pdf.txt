Abstract
Background: Simpler biological systems should be easier to understand and to engineer towards pre-defined
goals. One way to achieve biological simplicity is through genome minimization. Here we looked for genomic
islands in the fresh water cyanobacteria Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 (genome size 2.7 Mb) that could be
used as targets for deletion. We also looked for conserved genes that might be essential for cell survival.
Results: By using a combination of methods we identified 170 xenologs, 136 ORFans and 1401 core genes in the
genome of S. elongatus PCC 7942. These represent 6.5%, 5.2% and 53.6% of the annotated genes respectively. We
considered that genes in genomic islands could be found if they showed a combination of: a) unusual G+C
content; b) unusual phylogenetic similarity; and/or c) a small number of the highly iterated palindrome 1 (HIP1)
motif plus an unusual codon usage. The origin of the largest genomic island by horizontal gene transfer (HGT)
could be corroborated by lack of coverage among metagenomic sequences from a fresh water microbialite.
Evidence is also presented that xenologous genes tend to cluster in operons. Interestingly, most genes coding for
proteins with a diguanylate cyclase domain are predicted to be xenologs, suggesting a role for horizontal gene
transfer in the evolution of Synechococcus sensory systems.
Conclusions: Our estimates of genomic islands in PCC 7942 are larger than those predicted by other published
methods like SIGI-HMM. Our results set a guide to non-essential genes in S. elongatus PCC 7942 indicating a path
towards the engineering of a model photoautotrophic bacterial cell.

Background
The design and implementation of simpler biological
systems is relevant for biotechnological applications, and
as a way to address basic biological questions. In principle, simplified versions of extant cells should be easier
to understand and engineer towards a variety of tasks
like production of biomolecules or exploitation of metabolic or physiological process. Besides, the search for
simpler cells through genome reduction might help to
identify novel species-specific essential genes under a set
of defined conditions. This in turn will lead to improvements in our understanding of the basic machinery of

cells, and ultimately will shed light into the minimal and
sufficient features required for life [1].
Genomes of free living bacteria often contain a
plethora of genes necessary to face a changing and
unpredictable environment. For instance, it was shown
that among different strains of the marine picocyanobacteria Synechococcus sp. only between 52 - 67% of the
genes in each strain (~1,572 gene families) were shared
among all sequenced genomes [2]. A similar situation
was shown for Prochloroccocus marinus where only
40 - 67% of the genes (1,250 gene families) were shared
by all sequenced strains [3]. While genes from the core
genome (i.e., the set of genes conserved among all
strains) code for essential genes, the set of variable
genes might be composed of a) genes necessary for living in particular micro-environments (to which each
strain is adapted); b) genes relatively neutral to cell

fitness that might have arrived by HGT; and c) selfish
genetic elements [4]. Although some of these variable
genes might be necessary to survive in nature, they
probably are unnecessary under laboratory or other artificial conditions. They can even constitute barriers that
obstruct human manipulation of the organism for biotechnological or other purposes. The concept of a
tabula rasa genome [5] implies that by eliminating the
set of variable genes, a reduced (and optimized) genome
with the necessary functions to sustain a cell would be
obtained.
Identification of dispensable genes in genomes is often
carried out through comparative analysis between strains
(i.e., genes present in some but absent in other strains are
classified as dispensable). This approach was performed
successfully for Escherichia coli, where a reduced version
of its genome with robust metabolic performance was
engineered [5]. By comparative genomics, Pósfai and coworkers [5] identified segments of the chromosome of
E. coli K-12 MG1655 that were absent in five other
E. coli strains. These genomic islands (GI), putatively
code for non-essential genes. By focusing initially on
large segments or GIs coding for IS-elements, they
deleted approximately 15% of the genome of E. coli. Surprisingly, the resulting E. coli strain, endowed with this
reduced genome, showed a number of emergent properties, including more rapid growth rate, increased genome
stability and high electroporation efficiency.
Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 is an obligate
photoautotrophic fresh-water cyanobacteria described
initially by von Nägeli [6]. Two strains from S. elongatus
(PCC 6301 and PCC 7492) have been sequenced to date
[7]. With a genome of approximately 2.7 Mb and two
plasmids (8 kb and 46 kb) S. elongatus was the first cyanobacteria demonstrated to be transformable by exogenously added DNA [8]. It is a model for the circadian
clock in prokaryotes [9]. Large scale inactivation experiments were performed to identify loci that are important for circadian rhythms of gene expression [10]. Its
biological properties, like autotrophy, transformability,
relatively rapid growth rate and easiness of cultivation,
make this organism an ideal candidate for biotechnological applications that require a photosynthetic organism. Here we carry out a bioinformatic analysis of the
S. elongatus genome and identify regions coding for
putatively dispensable or essential genes. This work constitutes a first step towards the engineering of a reduced
genome for a model autotrophic cyanobacteria.

Results and Discussion
Phylogenomic analysis

To better evaluate the results from a comparative genome analysis, we reconstructed a phylogenetic tree from
available cyanobacterial genomes. Reciprocal best BLAST

hit searches were performed among 41 cyanobacterial
genomes, revealing 473 protein families of putative
orthologous genes. From them, we selected 231 families
belonging to the set of conserved proteins identified by
[11]. After aligning individual protein families and trimming for poorly aligned regions, we concatenated all
sequences to get a final matrix of 63,065 amino acid residues. A Minimum-Evolution tree was reconstructed from
this matrix (Figure 1). The resulting tree is in general
agreement with other phylogenomic trees [11-13] and
with 16S rRNA trees [14]. The branching of Synechococcus sp. WH5701 within Prochlorococcus clade has been
observed in other phylogenomic analyses [13]. As shown
in Figure 1, while S. elongatus is the sister group of marine picocyanobacteria (Prochlorococcus marinus and
Synechococcus sp.) it is not closely related to any other
cyanobacterial lineage in the dataset.
Detection of genomic islands

Genomic comparison between different strains of a single
species is the most direct approach to identify conserved
and variable regions in genomes. This approach was successfully applied to identify deletable genes in Escherichia
coli [15]. However, as previously reported for S. elongatus
[7], genomic comparison of PCC 7942 and PCC 6301
strains revealed that this approach was not useful for these
genomes due to lack of large genomic differences. The single major difference between both genomes was an inversion comprising ~188.6 kb located from nucleotides
1,704,219 to 1,515,607 in PCC 7942. Smaller differences
corresponded to single nucleotide polymorphisms and two
small deletions in PCC 7942 relative to PCC 6301. Also,
differences in protein coding sequences among genomes
reflected differences in annotations rather than differences
at the level of DNA (data not shown). This low level of
divergence was also evident from the short branches
separating both strains in Figure 1.
To deal with the lack of available genomic diversity
among sequenced Synechococcus elongatus strains, we
relied on a combination of methodologies to seek for
horizontally transferred genes (HTG). In the first place,
we looked at three features that could be indicative of a
xenology, namely: a) genes having few (or none) copies
of a signature motif (see below) in combination with an
unusual codon usage; b) genes having an unusual phylogenetic relationship; and c) genes with an unusual G+C
content. We classified as xenologs all genes sharing at
least two of the previous characteristics. Second, we also
included as xenologs those genes sharing a predicted
operon with previously identified xenologous genes if
having one of three features mentioned above. Third,
we reviewed information on IslandPath and IslandViewer databases to compare the genes contained in
these databases, known to be mobile, against our set of

identified xenologs, to look for genes that might have
passed undetected by our methods. Fourth, we compared the genome of PCC 7942 with metagenomic
sequences from a microbialite to look for regions of no
coverage that could suggest genomic islands. Finally, the

number and localization of ORFans was also investigated. The results are detailed next.
Unusual codon usage and signature motif HIP1

A fortunate genomic peculiarity of PCC 7942 helped us
in the complex task of identifying xenologous genes. We

Delaye et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:25
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/25

used the scarcity of a highly iterated palindrome
(5’-GCGATCGC-3’) designated HIP1 [16] in combination with unusual codon usage, as a signal of recent
xenology. HIP1 sequences are thought not to be mobile
within the genome, but rather to form in situ through
mutation [17]. HIP1 sequences are clearly overrepresented in the genome of PCC 7942 (7402 copies instead
of 60 expected). The number of HIP1 sequences among
ORFs in PCC 7942 ranges from 0 to 20 and their distribution is apparently random (Figure 2). As expected for
a random process, the number of copies of HIP1 per
gene is related to gene size (Figure 3), with some outstanding cases of ORFs having too few copies of HIP1
relative to their length.
It can be hypothesized that genes recently acquired by
HGT (particularly from non-cyanobacterial species)
would lack the HIP1 motif. By the same reasoning,
genes residing for a long time in the genome would
accumulate more HIP1 copies than recent xenologous
genes. However, the lack of HIP1 (or the small number
of copies relative to gene size) might be due to selection
against HIP1 for a number of obvious reasons, as indicated by the lack of HIP1 copies in rDNA and most of
the ribosomal protein genes (data not shown).
An initial set of ORFs with relative few copies of HIP1
motifs was identified as follows. We first formed groups of
ORFs according to their number of HIP1 motifs (0, 1, ...
n). Then, for all such groups with more than 50 ORFs, we
identified those ORFs with a size larger than 1standard
deviation (1SD) of the ORF size distribution (Figure 3).
Hereafter all these ORFs will be referred as HIP1less. Then,
to discriminate between the two possibilities (xenology or
natural selection against HIP1 motif) among the HIP1less

X-axis shows the categories of genes, according to their number of
HIP1 motifs. The Y-axis shows how many PCC 7942 genes belong to
each category. The distribution is reminiscent of a random process,
with most ORFs having none or a few copies of HIP1, and a few
ORFs having several ones.

set, we looked at codon usage. A bias in codon usage
among genes in a genome is sometimes related to translation efficiency. This is especially true in species with large
population sizes where natural selection can have a larger
influence in fine tuning highly expressed genes to match
tRNA abundance in the cell [18]. An algorithm to measure
codon bias among different gene classes was introduced by
[19]. For instance, in prokaryotic genomes, genes that
deviate strongly in codon usage from the average gene but
are sufficiently similar to codon usage from ribosomal protein genes (and to other experimentally determined highly
expressed genes like transcription factors and chaperone
degradation proteins) are predicted as highly expressed
(PHX). On the other hand, genes that differ from standard
classes of highly expressed genes, and to the codon usage
of the average gene in the genome, are predicted as putative alien (PA). We used the algorithm developed by [19]
as a criterion to discriminate between xenologs and highly
expressed genes among those in the HIP1less set. Accordingly, we measured the average codon usage for all genes
in the genome (B(F|C)) as a reference class of an average
gene, and the average codon usage of ribosomal proteins
(B(F|RP)) as a standard class of highly expressed genes.
However, B(F|X) where (X denotes C or RP gene
classes) is affected by ORF size (smaller ORFs tend to
give values closer to 1, see Additional File 1) making it

Delaye et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:25

difficult to compare the same measure (i.e., B(F|C))
among genes with different sizes. To correct for bias
due to differences in ORF sizes, we plotted B(F|X)
against the Log(gene length), adjusted a ln equation to
data, and then we measured the differences between B
(F|X) values (yB(F|X)) to their respective predicted values
(ŷB(F|X)). The calculated differences between observed
and predicted values (yB(F|X) - ŷB(F|X)) were then used as
a measure of deviation of codon usage when compared
to the codon usage of an average gene in the genome
(yB(F|C) - ŷB(F|C)), or the codon usage of highly expressed
genes (yB(F|RP) - ŷB(F|RP)) (see Additional File 1).
Then, for all genes belonging to the HIP1less set, we
defined as PA genes, those having a positive difference
larger than one standard deviation (1SD) in both measures. This indicates difference to both, highly expressed
proteins on the one hand, and on the other hand, to the
average gene in the genome. We defined as PHX those
having a positive difference larger than 1SD in B(F|C),
and a negative difference smaller than -1SD in B(F|RP),
which indicates close similarity to codon usage of highly
expressed ribosomal proteins. An extra category was
introduced, namely (PX) for proteins having a pattern
similar to highly expressed genes. In summary, the three
categories can be defined by the following relationships
(where ΔC = (yB(F|C) - ŷB(F|C)) and ΔRP = (yB(F|RP) - ŷB(F|
RP))):
PA = [ΔC > 1 SD C] AND [ΔRP > 1 SD RP];

(1)

PX = [ΔC > X C] AND [ΔRP < −1 SD RP]
OR

(2)

[ΔC > 1SD C] AND [ΔRP − X RP];
PHX = [ΔC > 1 SD C] AND [ΔRP < −1 SD RP];

(3)

By using these criteria we identified 60 genes as putative alien (PA), 38 showing a codon usage similar to
genes with high levels of expression (PX), and 12 cases
of putative highly expressed genes (PHX). A plot of B(F|
RP) against B(F|C) illustrates the differences among
these gene sets (Figure 4), where red, blue and green
colors stand for PA, PX and PHX respectively (gray dots
indicate genes from the HIP1less set that didn’t meet any
of the three previous criteria). Clearly, those genes
classified as highly expressed (PX and PHX) participate
in important functions in the cell (Table 1).
Unusual phylogenetic relationship

Another method to detect xenologous genes seeks for
sequences having unexpected phylogenetic relationships.
We carried out BLAST searches of all proteins coded in
PCC 7942 against the Genbank non-redundant (nr)

Figure 4 Identification of putative alien (PA), highly expressed
(PHX) and moderately highly expressed (PX) genes. For each
gene belonging to the HIP1less set (having to few HIP1 motifs for its
size) we calculated the codon usage bias against two set of genes:
a) the mean codon usage of all genes in the genome B(F|C); and b)
the codon usage of ribosomal proteins B(F|RP) which are expected
to be highly expressed. Genes with a codon usage suggesting a
high (PX) and very high (PHX) level of expression are shown in blue
and green respectively. Genes with a codon usage suggesting a
xenolog origin (PA) are shown in red. The rest of the genes
belonging to the HIP1less set that didn’t meet the criteria to be
included in PA, PX or PHX sets are shown in gray.

database. Then, we recorded whether or not the BLAST
best-hit belonged to cyanobacteria. We also downloaded
all best matches up to 10 sequences and, for all set of
homologous proteins having at least four members, we
reconstructed Neighbor-Joining trees with 100 bootstrap
replicates. For all cases where it was possible to identify
a unique nearest neighbor to the sequence from PCC
7942 (meaning that there is a partition that includes
both sequences with the exclusion of any other OTU)
with a bootstrap value over 50, we recorded whether it
belonged to a cyanobacterial species.
Conflicting data from BLAST best-hit and NeighborJoining trees was treated as follows. As it is known that
the BLAST best-hit is often not the nearest neighbor
[20], we identified first all sequences having a nearest
neighbor outside cyanobacteria according to NeighborJoining trees. Then, for those sequences for which it was
not possible to use the phylogenetic criteria (because the
immediate ancestral node of PCC 7942 protein did not
share a unique co-descendent OTU; or the bootstrap
value was lower than 50; or because there were not at
least four homologs in the database), we used the
BLAST best-hit criteria to decide whether the query
sequence was more similar to proteins belonging to non
cyanobacterial species.
BLAST comparisons against NCBI nr database
allowed us also to identify those proteins in PCC 7942

without homologs, the so called ORFans. Although it is
possible that a proportion of ORFans were false gene
predictions, the possibility that many were real genes
acquired by HGT from bacteriophages could not be
ruled out [21]. By manually inspecting the list of
ORFans, we removed eleven proteins that failed to hit
homologs above specified threshold due to its small size.
Among them, there were two very small proteins from
the cytochrome complex (petL and petM) and one from
the photosynthetic reaction center (psaM). We have also
identified two genes coding for proteins from phages
(Synpcc7942_0717 and Synpcc7942_2141).
As expected, the vast majority of proteins in PCC
7942 were more similar to sequences from other cyanobacteria (2212 out of 2612 proteins). Nevertheless, we
identified 253 proteins more similar to sequences from
species other than cyanobacteria, plus 136 ORFans
(Figure 5). Some of the hits to non-cyanobacterial species were to photosynthetic protists. Most of the similarities to non cyanobacterial species were to the phylum
proteobacteria (Figure 6).
It should be kept in mind that having a nearest neighbor (or best BLAST hit) to a non-cyanobacterial species,
does not necessarily mean that the gene in PCC 7942

most of them are related to proteobacteria.

was from HGT origin, because the opposite can also be
true: that the gene in the non-cyanobacterial species originated by HGT from a cyanobacteria. Therefore, additional criteria should be taken into account to decide
between the two possibilities.
G+C content

Although G+C deviation by itself is not a precise indicator of xenology, it can be useful in identifying recently
acquired genes if it is used in combination with the
other lines of evidence. In PCC 7942 there are 174 and
317 genes with a G+C content above, and below 1SD
from the average, respectively (Figure 7).
Identification of xenologous genes by the combination of
multiple approaches

Figure 5 Number of proteins in PCC 7942 with an unusual
phylogenetic relationship. For each protein coded in the genome
of PCC 7942 we did blast searches against NCBI nr database to
identify top scoring best hits. Then, for each protein having at least
4 hits we reconstructed a Neighbor-Joining tree (100 bootstrap
replications). We then identified whether the nearest neighbor in
the tree belonged to a cyanobacteria or not. When it was not
possible to use the tree to identify the nearest neighbor (because
the immediate ancestral node of PCC 7942 protein did not share a
unique co-descendent OTU; or the bootstrap value was lower than
50; or because there were not at least four homologs in the
database) we used the BLAST best hit criteria to decide whether or
not the query protein has an unusual phylogenetic relationship. As
shown, most proteins do not have its nearest homolog outside
cyanobacteria (1177 + 1035 = 2212); however 253 proteins have an
unusual phylogenetic relationship (10 of them to protists endowed
with plastids). *Number of proteins in which the phylum identified
was the same with BLAST and with Neighbor-Joining.

No single method is expected to identify all cases of
HGT. For instance, composition based methods are
biased towards the detection of relatively recent cases of
HTG [22]. On the other hand, phylogenetic based methods detect ancient HGT events [23]. When looking for
islands of variability in a genome where there are no
genomes from different strains to compare, the best
approach is to use a combination of methods, in order
to avoid as much as possible the detection of false positives [24]. We compared the set of genes having an unusual G+C content, with those identified as PA (detected
by atypical codon usage and low number of HIP1
motifs), and those having a nearest neighbor or best
BLAST hit outside cyanobacteria. Those genes identified
at least by two of the three methods were assumed to
be xenologs. As shown in Figure 8, we detected 128
such cases. We have repeated the analysis with different
SD cutoff values for the identification of PA, PX and

PHX genes, and for the identification of genes deviating
in G+C content. To evaluate the performance of these
different cutoffs we used as a control set 323 genes that
have not been subject to HGT among cyanobacteria
[11]. The usage of 1SD for both cutoffs seems to be the
best compromise between xenolog detection and avoidance of likely false positives (see Additional File 2).
Genomic island databases

We also surveyed information on GIs provided by IslandPath [25] and IslandViewer [26] databases. IslandPath
provides information on i) G+C content; ii) regions of
dinucleotide bias; iii) presence of known mobility genes

Page 8 of 18

like integrases and transposases; and iv) localization of
tRNAs (known to be proximal to recombination places in
the chromosome). By looking at this information, we
identified the following eight new xenologs: a) a phage
integrase (Synpcc7942_0136); b) a small genetic island
consisting of a phage integrase-like (Synpcc7942_1205)
followed by eight genes (three of them previously classified as xenologs by our method) and flanked by two
tRNA-Cys; and c) a transposase (Synpcc7942_1842) not
previously detected by our method.
IslandViewer database uses a combination of methods to
detect GIs [26]. However, due to the lack of genetic diversity among S. elongatus sequenced genomes, the only useful method was SIGI-HMM [27]. This method uses a
Hidden Markov Model (HMM) on measures of codon
usage to identify possible GIs. Two islands, comprising 18
genes, were detected by this method, one located between
nucleotides 48930 to 59068, and the other from 751277 to
758324. Of the 18 genes included on these islands, only 6
were previously undetected by our method, these are two
genes coding for PilA-like proteins (Synpcc7942_0048,
Synpcc7942_0049), two hypothetical proteins (Synpcc
7942_0757, Synpcc7942_0758), and two XRE family
transcriptional regulators (Synpcc7942_0763, Synpcc
7942_0764).
Operon structure of xenologous genes

We looked at the predicted operon structure of those
genes classified as xenologs to see if other genes within
the same predicted operon had one of the characteristics
previously used to identify cases of HGT (i.e., G+C bias,
PA and/or nearest neighbor outside cyanobacteria).
ORFans and genes from phages were also considered. If
this was indeed the case, these genes were classified also
as xenologs. By this method, we identified 25 predicted
operons in which all the genes in the operon (besides
the predicted xenologous gene), had at least one of the
characteristics used to identify xenology (and thus adding 33 such genes to the list). The exceptions were
seven predicted operons in which the accompanying
genes did not show any of the characteristics mentioned
above. These seven cases could be attributed to errors
in the operon prediction algorithm, false positives in the
method used here to detect xenologs, or to truly chimerical operons (in which only some of the genes comprising the operon arrived by horizontal gene transfer).
Comparison against metagenomic sequences from a freshwater microbialite

Figure 8 Identification of xenologs in PCC 7942 by combining
different sources of information. Cases of horizontally transferred
genes into the genome of PCC 7942 were identified by having at
least two of the following properties: G+C content deviating more
than 1 SD from the mean value of all genes; low number of HIP1
motifs relative to gene length well as an unusual codon usage (PA
genes); and an unusual phylogenetic relationship. ORFan genes
were also considered.

Islands of variability in genomes are also detected by
comparison to metagenomic sequences [28]. The rationale is simple; regions of variability in the genome of
interest will be underrepresented, while core genome
regions will be more represented in metagenomic
sequences. The presence of cyanobacteria from the order
of Chroococcales was reported in two metagenomes

Delaye et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:25
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/25

from fresh-water microbialites (Río Mesquitez and Pozas
Azules) in the desert of Cuatro Cienegas, México [29]. In
particular, sequences from Chroococcales in the metagenome of Río Mesquitez were the second most represented group with almost 20% of the classified sequences.
Although the percentage of the genome of PCC 7942
that is covered by metagenomic sequences from Río
Mesquitez and Pozas Azules was low (~1.5%), there was
a large gap in coverage between approximately nucleotides 710,000 and 775,000 (Figure 9) suggesting the presence of an island of variability in this region. This GI
coincides with one of the regions reported with SIGIHMM algorithm (located between nucleotides 751277
to 758324), with the largest region of contiguous genes
having a dinucleotide bias according to IslandPath database (comprising from gene Synpcc7946_0717 to
Synpcc7942_0764), and with the largest contiguous
region of likely xenologous genes detected here. Interestingly, high coverage regions corresponded to genes
predicted to be highly expressed.
Detection of conserved genes

Highly conserved genes comprise the other side of the
coin when looking for deletable regions in a genome.

Page 9 of 18

Phylogenetic distribution of homologous sequences
across genomes often follows a continuum, from genes
present in just a single genome, to highly conserved
genes present in a wide variety of lineages. This distribution has been described as consisting of three main
clusters, namely, a small core of highly conserved genes,
a larger shell of moderately conserved genes, and a
much larger cloud of genes conserved among few
lineages [30]. Highly conserved genes tend to be part of
the so called core genome or paleome (the set of genes
necessary for maintaining and replicating the cell), and
genes with narrower phylogenetic distribution tend to
be part of the cenome (genes necessary for living in a
particular environment) [31].
To identify the paleome genes in PCC 7942 we considered the following lines of evidence, a) genes in PCC
7942 belonging to the cyanobacterial genome core
CyOG database [32]; b) genes with homologs in at least
34 out of the 35 completely sequenced cyanobacterial
genomes (where each homolog must have an alignment
of at least 75% similarity to the query sequence); and c)
genes with reciprocal best hits to the genome of the
chromatophore of Paulinella chromatophora [33] and to
the genome of Prochlorococcus marinus SS120 [34].

Cuatro Cienegas along the genome of PCC 7942. X axis indicates the nucleotide position along the PCC 7942 genome. Left axis indicates the
percent of similarity of aligned metagenomic sequences to the genome of PCC 7942 (blue and red dots correspond to alignments to forward
and reverse strands to S. elongatus DNA). The position of these alignments along the genome are also shown at the bottom of the figure to
differentiate regions of coverage from non-coverage; right axis indicates a relative measure of coverage of sequences from the metagenomes on
the genome of PCC 7942 (the green line at the bottom corresponds to the metagenome from Río Mesquites; while the red line to the
metagenome from Pozas Azules). Coverage was calculated for windows of 10,000 nucleotides (sliding 500 nt.) as: (number of aligned nucleotides
along the genome)/10,000. The blue rectangle indicates a large region of no coverage along the genome. Larger coverage peaks correspond
mostly to genes classified as PX or PHX according to codon usage. The following genes contribute to the largest coverage peaks (1) FtsH
peptidase (Synpcc7942_0297, PX); (2) F0F1 ATP synthase subunit alpha (Synpcc7942_0336, PX); (3) photosystem II 44 kDa subunit reaction center
protein (Synpcc7942_0656, PHX); (4) ATPase, E1-E2 type (Synpcc7942_1082, PX), glycosyltransferase (Synpcc7942_1083), glycogen branching
enzyme (Synpcc7942_1085, PX), ATPase (Synpcc7942_1089, PX); (5) protochlorophyllide reductase iron-sulfur ATP-binding protein
(Synpcc7942_1419), light-independent protochlorophyllide reductase subunit N (Synpcc7942_1420, PX), putative carboxysome assembly protein
(Synpcc7942_1421); (6) two component transcriptional regulator (Synpcc7942_1453); (7) F0F1 ATP synthase subunit beta (Synpcc7942_2315, PX).

By using these four datasets we can classify genes
from the core genome in different categories. For
instance, genes belonging to CyOG database and genes
conserved in at least 34 of the 35 genomes studied here,
very likely are essential for any cyanobacterium. However, due to the evolutionary distance among sequenced
cyanobacteria, the set of genes in CyOG and conserved
among the genomes studied here, is a minimal and certainly not enough to maintain a cell by themselves.
Complementary to this, P. marinus SS120 has been proposed as a model for a minimum free-living photoautotrophic cell because it has one of the smallest genomes
among cyanobacteria [34]. The comparison against
this genome is informative about how far away is
S. elongatus from a real free-living photoautotrophic
bacteria with a reduced genome. The chromatophore
of P. chromatophora has a very small genome with

Page 10 of 18

only ~800 protein coding genes and is phylogenetically
related to P. marinus SS120. Although not a free living
entity, genes retained in the chromathophore are likely
to be important for the photoautotrophic life style [33].
The comparison against the chromatophore is indicative
of the genes necessary to maintain a real non-free living
photosynthetic cell.
The number of genes in PCC 7942 belonging to the
CyOG set, as well as those identified by best BLAST hits
with the two models of minimal photoautotrophic genomes, are shown in Figure 10a. When looking at the intersection of these data, it turned out that most (622 genes)
were shared between the three datasets (Figure 10b). In
addition, there were 66 genes shared by at least 34 out of
35 genomes analyzed that were not present in any of the
three previous comparisons. By pooling all four sets
together, we defined the paleome as comprising 1,401

Figure 10 Conserved genes in PCC 7942. a) Number of best reciprocal BLAST hits between PCC 7942 and each of the following genomes: P.
marinus SS 120, the chromatophore from P. chromatophora and the set of cyanobacterial conserved genes from CyOGs database; b) the set of
conserved genes in PCC 7942 is defined as the union of the tree above datasets, plus those conserved in 34 out of 35 genomes (this last
comparison added 66 genes to the dataset). Overall, the set of conserved genes comprises 54% of the genome of PCC 7942; c) the set of
conserved genes (or paleome) is enriched in genes with functional annotation.

Delaye et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:25
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/25

conserved genes. This correspond to ~54% of all protein
coding genes in PCC 7942 (Figure 10b). It is interesting to
note that the set of genes belonging to the paleome coincides with the number of genes of free-living prokaryotes
with the smallest genomes (i.e., Candidatus Pelagibacter
ubique with 1394 genes [35]; methylophilial bacteria
HTCC2181 with 1377 genes [36]; Ignicoccus hospitalis
KIN4/I with 1494 genes [37]). On the other hand, the set
of genes likely to be xenologs correspond to ~12% of protein coding genes in the genome. As expected, xenologs
and ORFans have the largest proportion of genes annotated as hypothetical proteins, while the paleome has the
smallest one (Figure 10c).

Page 11 of 18

were predicted to be xenologs (Figure 12). As suggested
by domains present in these proteins, they might participate in two component signal transduction systems. For
instance GGDEF and EAL domains are involved in the
turnover of cyclic-di-GMP in vivo [38]. On the other
hand, PAS domains were found to act as sensors for
light and oxygen in signal transduction systems [39].
Signal receiver domains [40] and GAF domains involved
in regulation of cGMP [41] as well as the integral membrane sensory domain MASE1 [42] were also found.
These data suggest that PCC 7942 could have acquired
many environmental sensing capabilities through HGT.
Horizontally transferred genes from central metabolism

Signal transduction systems

According to COG database, 1921 genes from PCC
7942 are classified in one or another functional category.
Of them, 1665 are assigned to only one functional category. On Figure 11 we show the COG classification of
these genes and whether they are likely xenologs, belong
to the paleome, or neither of them. As shown, categories
having more xenologs (besides ‘General function prediction only’) are ‘Signal transduction mechanism’ and ‘Cell
wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis’.
Among genes belonging to ‘Signal transductions
mechanisms’ category, it was particularly notable that,
out of 17 genes having a diguanylate cyclase domain, 11

We have found a series of horizontally transferred genes
that participate in important metabolic roles within the
cell. These include genes from oxidative phosphorylation, chlorophyll metabolism and starch and sucrose
metabolism, among others (Table 2). Some of the transfers are clearly from non cyanobacterial species to
S. elongatus, like in the case of perosamine synthetase.
In other cases, the transfer seems to be among different
species of cyanobacteria, like in the case of genes participating in oxidative phosphorylation where S. elongatus
genes branches with genes from Cyanothece sp. (data
not shown). In any case, it is noteworthy that genes that
participate in central functions in S. elongatus arrived by

Figure 11 Functional classification of xenologs and conserved genes in PCC 7942. Following COG database 1,921 genes from PCC 7942
are classified into functional categories. Of them, 1,665 genes are classified in a single category. Here we show whether these genes are
identified as core genes, xenologs or none of them. Xenologous genes are particularly abundant in the categories signal transduction
mechanisms and cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis.

horizontal gene transfer. Clearly, these genes are not
candidates to be deleted from the genome.
False positives

18 genes were classified both as xenologs as well as
belonging to the core set of genes, by the criteria used
in this work. To decide whether these were true xenologs or false positives, we carried out a more thoughtful
phylogenetic analysis. We reconstructed a phylogenetic
tree using the first one hundred hits from BLAST
against Genbank non redundant database, and we
inspected the results visually. Xenology was still supported in ten cases, and seven of them seemed to be
false positives (Table 3).

Conclusions
Blueprint for a reduced photoautotrophic cell

We present an analysis of conserved and variable regions in
the genome of the cyanobacteria Synechococcus elongatus,

strain PCC 7942. In Figure 13 we show the localization of
these regions along the genome. The complete list of conserved and variable genes is shown in Additional File 3.
Our results can be instrumental to test the essentiality/dispensability of genes in PCC 7942 by experimental
approaches in the pursuit of a streamlined photoautotrophic platform.
Conserved genes were detected by combining the
results of four analysis: (a) by looking at homologous in
a dataset of 35 complete cyanobacterial genomes, and
asking for at least 75% alignment coverage of the query
sequence; (b) by looking for conserved proteins by reciprocal best BLAST hit with the reduced genomes of
P. marinus SS120, and the chromatophore of P. chromatophora; and (c) by identification of proteins of PCC
7942 belonging to the set of conserved CyOGs [32]. As
expected, a large fraction of genes (~45%) overlapped in
the four datasets. These genes are likely to be essential
under a broad spectrum of environmental conditions.

Figure 13 Genomic islands and conserved genes in PCC 7942. Starting from the outermost circle: First two circles: xenologs and ORFans are
shown in red and blue respectively (both DNA strands are shown); third circle: regions of atypical three nucleotide composition (c 2 analyses,
see methods) are shown as purple peaks; fourth circle: genes not classified as xenologs nor core genes are shown in gray (for simplicity both
chains of DNA are shown as one); fifth circle, core genes in green (both DNA strands are shown). The genome was drawn using Genomeviz [53].

On the other hand, variable regions were detected by
a combination of methods that in isolation might not
offer strong evidence of xenology, but when combined,
we believe them to have high predictive power to identify cases of HGT. Our analysis exemplifies how to
detect GI in a phylogenetically isolated bacterial genome. In particular, the existence of HIP1 motifs facilitated the identification of recently acquired genes.

Nevertheless, some bias (on the conservative side) in
detection of xenologs was expected because the identification of genes with unusual phylogenetic relationships
was designed to search for genes not belonging to
cyanobacteria.
By eliminating dispensable genes, a simpler and smaller
genome might be engineered that could be used as a
chassis for diverse biotechnological applications.

Although there is no guarantee that all genes in GI will
be deletable without detrimental effects, by looking at
their annotated functions it is possible to have a clue of
their role in the cell. The elimination of genes that might
destabilize the genome by introducing undesired mutations, like integrases and transposases, is one of the first
obvious steps in this direction. Then, deletion experiments should be directed towards large GIs. If some of
the proposed deletions have an effect on fitness, it would
be necessary to allow for compensatory evolution to
restore the system to a new equilibrium before experimentally attempting new deletions [43]. It also has to be
noted that not all genes arrived by HGT are candidates
to be deleted from the genome, as exemplified by most of
the genes in Table 2. The approach presented here can
be further complemented by mechanistic models of subsystems of the cell (like metabolic models) to indicate
new avenues to engineer simpler biological systems.

Methods
Phylogenomic analysis

The complete genomes from 35 cyanobacteria plus 6
almost complete genomes from WGS projects (also from
cyanobacteria) were downloaded from NCBI (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). These were: Synechococcus
sp. CC9605, Synechococcus sp. CC9902, Synechococcus
sp. CC9311, Synechococcus sp. RCC307, Synechococcus
sp. WH 8102, Synechococcus sp. WH 7803, Prochlorococcus marinus str. MIT 9303, Prochlorococcus marinus str.
MIT 9313, Prochlorococcus marinus subsp. marinus str.
CCMP1375, Prochlorococcus marinus str. AS9601, Prochlorococcus marinus str. MIT 9515, Prochlorococcus
marinus str. NATL1A, Prochlorococcus marinus str. MIT
9301, Prochlorococcus marinus str. MIT 9215, Prochlorococcus marinus str. MIT 9312, Prochlorococcus marinus
str. MIT 9211, Prochlorococcus marinus subsp. pastoris
str. CCMP1986, Prochlorococcus marinus str. NATL2A,
Synechococcus elongatus PCC 6301, Cyanothece sp. PCC
7425, Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP-1, Acaryochloris marina MBIC11017, Anabaena variabilis ATCC
29413, Nostoc sp. PCC 7120, Nostoc punctiforme PCC
73102, Trichodesmium erythraeum IMS101, Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, Cyanothece sp. PCC 7424, Microcystis aeruginosa NIES-843,
Cyanothece sp. PCC 8801, Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142,
Synechococcus sp. JA-3-3Ab, Synechococcus sp. JA-2-3B’a
(2-13), Gloeobacter violaceus PCC 7421. Putative orthologs among these genomes were identified by BLAST
best-reciprocal hits [44]. From the set of putative orthologs identified (473 protein families), we selected those
belonging to the set identified by [11], as it was suggested
that these proteins are less prone to HGT during the
evolution of cyanobacteria. The selected 231 protein
families were aligned with MUSCLE software [45] and

Page 15 of 18

poorly aligned regions were trimmed with Gblocks [46]
using default parameters. Then, aligned protein families
were concatenated in a single matrix of 63,065 amino
acids, and a Minimum-Evolution (using Poisson distance
correction and 100 bootstrap replicas) and a Parsimony
trees were reconstructed using MEGA4.0 software [47].
We also reconstructed a Maximum-Likelihood tree on de
same data using TREE-PUZZLE software v5.2[54].
Analysis of HIP1 motif

The complete genome from Synechococcus elongatus
PCC 7942 (NC_007604) was downloaded from NCBI
database and a script written in Perl language (available
upon request) was used to identify the position of HIP1
motifs along the sequence and the number of motifs per
ORFs.
Unusual codon usage

Genes having unusual codon usage were identified by
the algorithm of [19]. The algorithm works as follow: let
G be a group of genes with average codon frequencies g
(x, y, z) for the codon triplet (x, y, z), normalized for
each amino acid codon family such that Σ g(x, y, z) = 1,
where the sum extends over all codons (x, y, z) translated to amino acid a. Let f(x, y, z) indicate the average
codon frequencies for the gene group F, normalized to 1
in each amino acid codon family. The codon usage difference of the gene family F relative to the gene family
G (codon bias relative to G) is calculated by the formula
B(F | G) =

∑ Pa(F)[ ∑
a

| ΔCU |]

( x , y , z = a)

AND
ΔCU = f ( x , y , z) − g( x , y , z)

Where {Pa(F)} are the average amino acid frequencies
of the genes of F. Then, B(F|G) refers as the codon bias
of F with respect to G. We measured the codon bias of
all protein coding genes in PCC 7942 with respect to
the average codon frequencies of ribosomal proteins B
(F|RP) and with respect to the mean codon usage of all
ORFs in the genome B(F|C). All measurements were
done using a script in Perl available upon request.
Unusual phylogenetic relationship

BLAST searches of all amino acid sequences encoded in
PCC 7942 were performed against Genbank non-redundant (nr) database and it was recorded whether the best
hit corresponded to a cyanobacteria or not. We also
downloaded the first 10 best hits and performed a
Neighbor-Joining three on them using PHYLIP package
[48]. We recorded whether the nearest neighbor OTU

Delaye et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:25
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/25

to the query sequence belonged to cyanobacteria or not.
For the similarity to be significant, the bootstrap value
of the node connecting both OTUs should be larger
than 50. The analysis was carried out using Bioperl
scripts [49] available upon request.
Operon structure of xenologous genes

First we identified the operon structure of detected xenologous genes relying on the operon predictor algorithm
provided by BioCyc database [50]. Then, we looked if
other genes in the same operon as the detected xenologous ORFs showed at least one of the features used to
detect xenologs previously (namely, biased G+C content;
low number of HIP1 motifs and unusual codon usage;
and/or best-hit or nearest neighbor to an organism other
than cyanobacteria). If this was indeed the case, we classified the accompanying gene(s) also as xenologs.
Comparison against metagenomic sequences

We compared the genome sequence of PCC 7942
against two metagenomes from fresh-water microbialites
[29] using MUMmer 3.0 software [51].
Core genome

To identify highly conserved sequences belonging to the
core genome, several lines of evidence were followed.
On the first place, best reciprocal BLAST hits were
identified (independently) between: PCC 7942 and the
chromatophore of Paulinella chromatophora [33] and
between PCC 7942 and the genome of Prochlorococcus
marinus SS120 [34]. Also, genes from PCC 7942 with
homologs in at least 34 out of 35 complete genomes
from cyanobacteria (having a coverage alignment of at
least 75%) were also identified as belonging to the core.
Finally, those sequences from PCC 7942 belonging to
the set of CyOGs [32] were also classified as core genes.
c2 Analysis

Regions of atypical nucleotide composition were identified by c2 analysis; the distribution of all 64 tri-nucleotides (3mers) was computed for the complete genome in
all six reading frames, followed by the 3mer distribution
in 5,000-bp windows. Windows overlapped by 500 bp.
For each window, the c 2 statistic on the difference
between its 3mer content and that of the whole genome
was computed. Peaks in Figure 12 indicate regions of
atypical tri-nucleotide composition.
