Abstract
Background: Paraoxonase-1 (PON1), a lactonase synthesized by the liver, circulates in blood bound to high-density
lipoproteins (HDL). This enzyme is thought to degrade oxidized phospholipids and play an important role in the
organism's antioxidant and anti-inflammatory system. Chronic liver diseases are characterized by decreased serum
PON1 activity. The aim of the present study was to investigate the compositional changes in HDL that could influence
PON1 activity in liver impairment.
Methods: The study was performed in samples from five patients with advanced liver cirrhosis and with preserved
renal function, chosen on the basis of having low serum PON1 activity and high serum PON1 concentration. As a
control group, we accessed five healthy volunteers from among our hospital staff. Lipid and protein compositional
analysis of lipoprotein particles were done by high-performance liquid chromatography, gel electrophoresis, and
Western-Blot.
Results: HDL particles from cirrhotic patients had an increased phospholipid content that was inversely correlated to
PON1 activity. The HDL particles contained high levels of PON1 that corresponded, in part, to an immunoreactive
protein of high molecular weight (55 kDa) not present in control subjects. This protein was identified as glycosylated
PON1 and was also present in biopsies from patients with steatosis and from rats with CCl4-induced hepatic
impairment. These changes were associated with an increased plasma concentration of markers of oxidative stress,
inflammation and fibrogenesis.
Conclusion: Abnormalities in the composition of lipids and proteins of HDL particles, including PON1 glycosylation,
are associated with the decrease in serum PON1 activity in patients with liver disease. These alterations may adversely
affect the protective role of HDL against oxidative stress and inflammation in these patients.
Background
Paraoxonase-1 (PON1) is an esterase and lactonase that is
found in the circulation bound to high-density lipoproteins (HDL) [1]. The original function of PON1 was that
of a lactonase; lipophylic lactones constituting its primary
substrates [2]. PON1 is thought to degrade oxidized
phospholipids in lipoproteins and play an important role
in the organism's antioxidant system [3,4]. Alterations in

circulating PON1 levels have been found associated with
a variety of diseases involving oxidative stress [5,6].
Experimental data show a clear link between PON1,
HDL and inflammation. HDL particles possess antiinflammatory properties, including the suppression of
cytokine-induced endothelial cell adhesion molecules
[7,8]. Recent studies in healthy volunteers showed a close
relationship between circulating HDL levels and the
inflammatory response to endotoxin challenge; the incidence and severity of clinical symptoms and the plasma
concentrations of tumor necrosis factor, interleukins 1, 6
and 8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1)
being higher in subjects with low HDL than in those with

normal HDL levels [9]. MCP-1 is intimately involved in
the inflammatory reaction. This chemokine regulates the
migration of monocytes into tissues and their subsequent
differentiation into macrophages [10]. An end-product of
lipid peroxidation (4-hydroxy-2-nonenal) and oxidized
phospholipids present in LDL have been shown to stimulate the production of MCP-1 in vitro [11-13]. We had
demonstrated that PON1 inhibits MCP-1 production in
endothelial cells incubated with oxidized LDL, and that
this property appeared to be due to its capacity to inhibit
LDL oxidation [14]. Studies in experimental animals support the concept of an anti-inflammatory role for PON1.
Transgenic mice fed a high-fat and high-cholesterol diet
developed less atherosclerotic lesions, lower oxidative
stress, and lower MCP-1 expression in their aortas than
their corresponding control littermates [15]. These
results confirm other studies that had shown that PON1
knock-out mice had higher peripheral lipid peroxidation
and a higher degree of macrophage oxidative stress [16].
Further, a recent study showed that, even in the absence
of hyperlipidemia, PON1 deficiency promoted proinflammatory changes in the expression of adhesins [17].
The liver plays a key role in the synthesis of PON1 [18],
and chronic liver diseases are associated with increased
oxidative stress, MCP-1 synthesis, and inflammation
[19,20]. In previous studies, we reported that serum
PON1 activity is decreased in patients with chronic liver
impairment, while serum PON1 concentration and
hepatic PON1 protein expression are increased [21-23].
More recent evidence indicates that PON1 over-expression provides strong protection against the development
of experimental liver disease [24]. Conversely, low PON1
activity is associated with an enhanced sensitivity to the
development of liver damage [25].
Not much is known about the biochemical mechanisms
underlying these alterations in PON1 synthesis and
secretion in liver diseases. A likely hypothesis is that
PON1 activity is influenced by alterations in HDL structure and composition, secondary to an impaired synthesis
of this lipoprotein by the liver. This subject has not been
sufficiently explored, to-date. We performed the present
study to investigate the lipid and protein changes in HDL
particles that could potentially influence PON1 activity
and, as well, the effect of these changes on oxidative stress
and inflammation in patients with chronic liver impairment.

related to other HDL compositional alterations. To maximize the observed changes, we selected five patients'
samples from our bio-bank on the basis of having the
lowest serum PON1 activity and the highest serum PON1
concentration. The patients (age: 46 to 76 years; 3 men, 2
women) had an advanced liver cirrhosis and preserved
renal function. Their diagnoses were performed by
means of a complete analytical and clinical exploration
including echography to evaluate splenomegaly or portal
vein dilation, and fibrogastroscopy to detect the presence
of gastroesophageal varices. They all had ascites. The etiology of their disease was alcohol abuse. Serological analyses for hepatitis B, C, and human immunodeficiency
virus infections were negative. As a control group, we
accessed five healthy volunteers from among our hospital
staff (age: 25 to 51; 3 men, 2 women). Blood samples were
collected at 4°C, immediately centrifuged, and the serum
or plasma frozen at -80°C for batched analyses. For some
of the Western blot analyses described in the Results section we obtained liver biopsy material from 2 patients
with hepatic steatosis and inflammation, who had undergone bariatric surgery for the treatment of morbid obesity. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of
the Hospital Universitari de Sant Joan and written
informed consent was obtained from all the participants.
Induction of experimental liver damage in rats

To investigate the differential expression of PON1 protein
in normal and diseased livers, we employed the model of
CCl4-induced hepatic damage in rats [26]. Liver fibrosis
was induced in male Wistar rats weighing 207 ± 9 g (Panlab, Barcelona, Spain) by twice-a-week intra-peritoneal
(i.p.) injections over a period of 6, 8 and 12 weeks (2 animals for each time period) of 0.5 mL of CCl4 diluted 1:1
(v/v) in olive oil. An additional group of 2 rats receiving
only the excipient olive oil was used as a control group.
Fibrosis and cirrhosis were efficiently induced in CCl4administered rats, as verified by histopathology. All the
animals were fed ad libitum with standard rat chow (Harlan Interfauna, Barcelona, Spain). Before sacrifice, the livers were removed under anesthesia, portions were frozen
in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C for subsequent
analyses. The handling of animals and the procedures
described were approved by the Ethics Committee on
Animal Experimentation of the Rovira i Virgili University.
Compositional analysis of serum lipoproteins

Methods
Participants

As stated before, case-control studies showing a
decreased serum PON1 activity and increased PON1
concentration have already been published [21-23], and
the aim of the present investigation was to add a further
insight into the hypothesis that these changes may be

Human serum lipoproteins were separated by a dual
detection high-performance liquid chromatography
method (HPLC) as previously described [27,28]. In brief,
100 μl of diluted serum were applied onto two columns of
TSK gel Lipopropak XL connected in tandem and eluted
at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min with 50 mM Tris acetate buffer, pH = 8.0, containing 0.3 M sodium acetate, 0.05%

sodium azide, and 0.005% Brij-35. The TSK column
medium is composed of porous polymer matrices with a
nominal bed size of 10 μm and a pore size of 100 nm. The
matrices are expected to exclude most of chylomicrons in
the void volume. The concentrations of total cholesterol,
free cholesterol, triglycerides, and phospholipids in
serum and in the eluted fractions were measured by enzymatic methods (Wako Chemicals, Osaka, Japan). The
concentrations of apolipoproteins (apo) A-I, apo A-II and
apo E were determined by immunoturbidimetry (Daiichi
Pure Chemicals Co., Tokyo, Japan). Lipoprotein fractionation by HPLC and the measurement of lipid and apolipoprotein concentrations were outsourced to Skilight
Biotech Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). The lipoprotein fractions
were then returned frozen via door-to-door express courier to Reus for the measurement of PON1 activity and
concentration. PON1 activities in serum and lipoprotein
fractions were measured as the rate of hydrolysis of
paraoxon at 410 nm and 37°C [21]. PON1 concentration
was determined by an in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method [29].
Western blot of HDL-bound and liver PON1

HDL isolation was performed by the method of Havel et
al. [30] in a Centricon 75 ultracentrifuge (Kontron Instruments Ltd., Italy) using a Kontron TFT 45.6 fixed angle
rotor. We performed a denaturing gel electrophoresis
with HDL protein load of 20 μg, or 25 μg of liver protein,
in a NuPAGE® 4-12% pre-cast gel (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA). Because lipids modify the electrophoretic
mobility of the proteins, HDL were previously delipidated
with methanol and diethyl ether, and resuspended in
urea. Liver homogenates were obtained as previously
described [31]. Protein transfer on to a nitrocellulose
membrane was with an iBlot™ Dry Blotting System (Invitrogen). PON1 Western blot was performed with antibodies obtained by inoculating rabbits with the peptide
CRNHQSSYQTRLNALREVQ
derived
from
the
sequence of mature PON1, as has been described [29,32].
The antibody was used at a 1/10000 dilution. A polyclonal anti-rabbit-HRP secondary antibody (Dako,
Glostrup, Denmark) was used at a dilution of 1/2000. We
used the Amersham ECL™ Advanced Western Blotting
Detection Kit (GE Healthcare, Fairfield, CT, USA) for the
chemiluminescent detection of the bands. The images
were acquired with a Versadoc Gel Imaging System (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA).
To characterize the glycosylation status of PON1
immunoreactive bands, we incubated HDL with peptideN-glycosidase F (PNGase F), according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). This enzyme
releases asparagine-linked oligosaccharides from glycoproteins by hydrolyzing the amide group of the asparagine side chain.

Gel electrophoresis of HDL particles

HDL particle size was estimated by non-denaturing gel
electrophoresis of the HDL fraction obtained by ultracentrifugation. A polyacrylamide gel (Novex® 4-20% Tris-Glycine pre-cast gels; Invitrogen) was run according to the
manufacturer's indications. The bands were visualized by
Coomassie® blue staining (Colloidal Blue Staining Kit;
Invitrogen).
Measurement of other biochemical parameters

Serum cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) was analyzed by the method of Lagrost and Barter [33]. Lecithin:cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT) activity was
measured by the method of Lagrost et al. [34]. Phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) was determined by the
method of Damen et al. [35]. Serum total peroxides concentration was analyzed by a colorimetric enzymatic
assay (Immun-Diagnostik AG, Benshein, Germany).
MCP-1 concentration in EDTA plasma was measured by
ELISA (Peprotech, London, UK). Serum type III procollagen-N-peptide (P-III-P) concentration, a marker of liver
fibrogenesis, was determined by radioimmunoassay
(Orion Diagnostica OY, Espoo, Finland). Serum alanine
aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, γ-glutamyl
transferase, and alkaline phosphatase activities, and albumin and bilirubin concentrations were measured by standard methods with reagents purchased from BeckmanCoulter (Fullerton, CA, USA).
Statistical analysis

Curvilinear regression analyses were employed to evaluate the degree of association between variables. Results
are shown as means and SD (in parenthesis). Statistical
analyses were performed with the SPSS 17.0 statistical
package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL. USA).

Results
Changes in liver function tests and serum lipoproteins

Relative to the control group, the patients with chronic
liver impairment had, as expected, a significant increase
in serum aminotransferases and alkaline phosphatase
activities together with a decrease in albumin, HDL-cholesterol, and apo A-I concentrations. They also showed a
profound decrease in serum PON1 activity and an
increase in PON1 concentration, together with an
increase in total peroxides, MCP-1, and P-III-P concentrations (Table 1). There were highly significant inverse
relationships between PON1 activity and total peroxides,
MCP-1, and P-III-P (Fig. 1).
We observed significant changes in the HPLC lipoprotein profile in the patients with respect to the control
group (Fig. 2). Patients had significant decreases in cholesterol and phospholipid concentrations in very lowdensity and low-density lipoproteins (VLDL + LDL, frac-

ticles, we calculated the measured variables as ratios of
apo A-I concentrations. We observed that patients with
liver impairment had a significant increase in the HDL
phospholipids to apo A-I ratio [1.75 (0.39) vs. 1.10 (0.12);
p = 0.007] and in the PON1 mass to apo A-I ratio [227.5
(93.1) vs. 45.0 (10.1); p = 0.002]. There were no significant
differences in any of the other ratios. The phospholipids
to apo A-I ratio and the PON1 protein to apo A-I ratio
were inversely correlated with PON1 activity (Fig. 3).

nate from a patient with steatosis was incubated in vitro
with normal human HDL and then subjected to Western
blot analysis, we did not observe any abnormal immunoreactive band (Fig. 4C). Further, this protein band disappeared when HDL was incubated with PNGase F;
suggesting that it consisted of glycosylated PON1 (Fig.
4D).

Abnormal immunoreactive protein reaction against antiPON1 antibodies

We investigated the alterations in HDL particle size using
non-denaturing gel electrophoresis. Patients with chronic
liver disease had a higher degree of heterogeneity with
respect to HDL particle size than healthy volunteers (Fig.
5). Electrophoretic banding patterns indicated the presence of small (<100 kDa) HDL particles only in the
patients. HDL particles between 100 and 200 kDa were
present in the sera of all five control individuals but in
only two of the patients. On the other hand large (>300
kDa) HDL were present in all five patients, but in only
two of the control subjects. We observed a significant
increase in serum CETP and PLTP, and a decrease in
LCAT activities in patients relative to controls (Table 2).

The HDL particles from cirrhotic patients contained high
levels of a protein which reacted against anti-PON1 antibody and had an estimated weight of 55 kDa. This protein
was not present in the control subjects (Fig. 4A). To further characterize this protein, we performed Western
blot analysis of the liver homogenates of biopsies
obtained from patients with hepatic steatosis, as well as
from rats with CCl4-induced hepatic impairment. We
observed that the livers from both sources, the patients
and the CCl4-administered animals, had a similar immunoreactive band (Fig. 4B). However, when a liver homoge-

Discussion
The molecular bases underlying the alterations in the circulating PON1 activity together with its synthesis and
secretion in chronic liver diseases are far from being
completely understood, despite these changes being of
crucial importance in the pathophysiology of chronic
liver impairment. As illustrated in the present investigation, patients with liver cirrhosis had an increased serum
concentration of total peroxides (a marker of oxidative
stress), MCP-1 (an index of inflammation), and P-III-P (a
marker of liver fibrogenesis). All these changes were
observed to be strongly associated with a decrease in
serum PON1 activity. Although a direct functional relationship between serum PON1 activity alterations,
inflammation and fibrogenesis cannot be deduced from
the present investigations, these data provide further support for studies showing that oxidative stress activates
hepatic stellate cell and macrophages in vitro and in
experimental models of liver impairment [32,36-38]. A
possible answer to the question of why serum PON1
activity is decreased is that PON1 is inactivated by oxidized lipids, as was shown by Aviram et al. [39] who demonstrated that the incubation of PON1 in vitro with
oxidized palmitoyl arachidonoyl phosphatidylcholine,
lysophosphatidylcholine, oxidized cholesteryl arachidonate and oxidized LDL resulted in inactivation of PON1
arylesterase activity. Indeed, in a previous study, we
observed that alcoholic patients with a normal, or with
minimally-affected liver function, already had a
decreased serum PON1 activity that was associated with
an increase in the circulating concentration of malondialdehyde [23]. These data support the hypothesis of a direct
inhibition by lipid peroxides on the PON1 enzyme active
site. However, liver cirrhosis is a chronic and diffuse disease that is usually protracted in its development, and in

which multiple metabolic derangements appear progressively, including an altered capacity of pan-protein synthesis by the liver. A likely possibility (and one which does
not exclude an inhibition by lipid peroxidation products)
is that, in advanced liver impairment, changes in HDL
structure and composition influence PON1 activity. This
appears feasible since it is well documented that PON1
activity is profoundly dependent on the lipid and protein
compositional environment of the HDL particles [40].
Results from the present study suggest that PON1
activity and mass are associated, both in control subjects
as well as in cirrhotic patients, with a specific sub-population of HDL particles containing apo A-I, but with not
apo A-II and apo E. These results agree with a study by
Cabana et al. [41] that showed a similar distribution of
PON1 in human HDL sub-fractions obtained by FPLC
and with experimental studies in apo A-II transgenic
mice in which apo A-II enrichment was found to displace
PON1 from HDL and, as well, to impair the antioxidant
and athero-protective function of this particle [42,43].
However, our results differ from other reports in which
HDL was isolated by other methods. Bergmeier et al. [44]
observed a high PON1 activity in HDL3 particles isolated
by ultracentrifugation, and which contained apo E.
Moren et al. [45] observed considerable PON1 activity in
apo A-II-containing HDL isolated by immunoprecipitation. Methodological differences probably account for the
observed discrepancies, but we believe that HPLC or
FPLC fractionation methods are less physico-chemically
aggressive and, as such, are less likely to alter HDL composition in the process of isolation.
Non-denaturing gel electrophoresis showed a considerable increase in very small and very large HDL particles
from cirrhotic patients compared to the control subjects.
These changes are probably secondary to alterations in

CETP, PLTP, and LCAT levels in these patients. Although
reduced LCAT activity is common in a variety of liver diseases [46], the current report is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to identify increased CETP and PLTP
activities as being associated with chronic liver impairment. These findings will require confirmation in much
larger studies of cases versus controls. The mechanisms

leading to increased CETP and PLTP activities in chronic
liver disease are also unclear at present. The outcome
observed could be due to increased synthesis and secretion, decreased degradation (or both) or an entirely different mechanism such as an effect of HDL composition
on enzyme activity. Again, further studies are required.
The combination of decreased LCAT and increased

CETP activities in the patients probably resulted in the
increase in small HDL particles. However, the greater
PLTP activity would also have resulted in increased fusing of small HDL into the larger HDL particles found in
the patients [47-49]. Therefore changes in the activities of
the lipid transfer proteins could explain the different pattern of HDL particles found in the patients. An increase
in PLTP would lead to larger HDL particles, while an
enhancement in CETP and a decrease in LCAT would
result in smaller HDL particles with an increase in the
HDL3 sub-fraction. While the impact of a larger particle
size in relation to HDL function remains unclear, extensive data from the literature show that small HDL particles lose most of their antioxidant properties, and may
become pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory instead
[50,51]. In addition, results from the present study suggest that these small particles do not carry PON1 and, as
such, would contribute to the decrease in serum PON1
activity observed. However, it is also possible that
changes in HDL size are associated with firmer binding of
PON1 but not with changes in activity.
We noted an inverse relationship between phospholipid
content and PON1 activity in HDL particles. In addition,
considerable amounts of PON1 protein, but low enzyme
activity, were observed in particles eluting at HPLC fractions #31-35 in which phospholipids concentrations were
below the detection limit of the assay. These results suggest that an appropriate balance between phospholipids
and PON1 is important in maintaining the enzyme's
activity. Indeed, the proportional distribution of phos-

Page 8 of 10

pholipids and apo A-I in HDL has been shown to play an
important role in PON1 secretion, stability and activity.
Sorenson et al. [52] showed that PON1 was associated
with HDL more via the binding to phospholipids than to
apo A-I. Nevertheless, apo A-I stabilized the enzyme
activity more than did phospholipids alone. These results
were confirmed by Deakin et al. [53]. Hence the hypothesis follows that an increased phospholipids to apo A-I
ratio, as observed in cirrhotic patients, contributes to
PON1 instability. Previous studies from our group
[22,23,31] showed that PON1 activity in patients with
liver disease is inversely related to PON1 mass. These
results prompted us to investigate the nature of PON1
protein in patients with cirrhosis. One of the more interesting findings from the present investigation has been
the identification by Western blot of an abnormal protein
that reacted against the anti-PON1 antibody, had a higher
molecular weight than PON1, and was present in the
HDL from cirrhotic patients but not in control subjects.
This protein was also present in the livers of patients with
steatosis (a more benign form of liver disease) and in rats
with CCl4-induced cirrhosis. Additionally in these animals, the amount of abnormal PON1 increased along the
time-course of the disease development. These results
highlight the presence of this protein in liver impairment
per se, irrespective of the etiology or, even, the animal
species. The incubation of HDL with PNGase F strongly
suggests that this protein is, indeed, a highly glycosylated
form of PON1. Interestingly, Liu et al. [54] observed that
when they produced recombinant human PON1 in a baculovirus system in Hi5 insect cells, a significant proportion of PON1 was synthesized as a protein of
approximately 54,000 Da, and which they identified as a
PON1 multimer. Taking these data together, we can
hypothesize that abnormal PON1 molecules are synthesized under diverse altered conditions such as liver disease, or when human PON1 is synthesized by
phylogenetically-distant cells. An important finding of
the present study is that when a liver homogenate from a
patient with steatosis was incubated in vitro with normal
HDL, the altered immunoreactive band was no longer
observed. These results suggest that the high molecular
weight PON1-like protein is actively incorporated into
the HDL particles within the hepatocytes, and that it is

not a mere artifact or a result of a non-specific adsorption
of PON1 fragments by HDL particles in the circulation.
The possibility exists that highly glycosylated PON1 is
abnormally assembled into HDL particles in liver disease
secondarily to alterations in protein synthesis in hepatocytes or to altered hepatic lipid metabolism.

Conclusions
We conclude that abnormalities in the composition of
lipids and proteins of HDL particles are associated with
the decrease in serum PON1 activity in patients with liver
disease. Of special note is the presence of a high molecular weight inactive PON1 carried in the HDL in large
quantities. These alterations may play a role in the diminished protection against oxidative stress and inflammation in these patients.
