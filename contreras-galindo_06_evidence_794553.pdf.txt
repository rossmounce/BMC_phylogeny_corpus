Background

Conclusion

The infectious capacity of particle-coding human endogenous retrovirus type-K HERV-K(HML-2) virions is still
questionable.

Our data suggest that the HERV-K(HML-2) family code
for infectious viral particles. RNA recombination could
serve to efficiently remove mutated HERV-K alleles by
combining intact parts of different genomes

Materials and methods
The full-length RNA env gene, necessary for cell-to-cell
transmission, was amplified from plasma samples (three
time-points) of six HIV-1 seropositive individuals and
sequenced in order to track the phylogenetic evolution of
HERV-K.

Results
Type-1 and Type-2 HERV-K(HML-2) were co-amplified.
Phylogenetic analyses revealed frequent detection of inter
and intra-subtype HERV-K(HML-2) recombinant env
sequences. Type-1 but not type-2 env sequences were
mostly edited at specific sites, originating a unique hypermutated consensus sequence (K111), which cluster in a
unique phylogenetic branch. HERV-K sequences less than
98% similar to known proviruses suggest that these proviruses are unfixed. dN/dS ratios < 1 strongly suggested that
HERV-K replicated by reinfection, which may explain the
finding of putative HERV-K recombinant and hypermutated sequences.
