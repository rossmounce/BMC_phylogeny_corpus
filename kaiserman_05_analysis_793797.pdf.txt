Abstract
Background: The human genome contains 13 clade B serpin genes at two loci, 6p25 and 18q21.
The three genes at 6p25 all conform to a 7-exon gene structure with conserved intron positioning
and phasing, however, at 18q21 there are two 7-exon genes and eight genes with an additional exon
yielding an 8-exon structure. Currently, it is not known how these two loci evolved, nor which
gene structure arose first – did the 8-exon genes gain an exon, or did the 7-exon genes lose one?
Here we use the genomes of diverse vertebrate species to plot the emergence of clade B serpin
genes and to identify the point at which the two genomic structures arose.
Results: Analysis of the chicken genome indicated the presence of a single clade B serpin gene
locus, containing orthologues of both human loci and both genomic structures. The frog genome
and the genomes of three fish species presented progressively simpler loci, although only the 7exon structure could be identified. The Serpinb12 gene contains seven exons in the frog genome,
but eight exons in chickens and humans, indicating that the additional exon evolved in this gene.
Conclusion: We propose a new model for clade B serpin evolution from a single 7-exon gene
(either Serpinb1 or Serpinb6). An additional exon was gained in the Serpinb12 gene between the
tetrapoda and amniota radiations to produce the 8-exon structure. Both structures were then
duplicated at a single locus until a chromosomal breakage occurred at some point along the
mammalian lineage resulting in the two modern loci.

The serpins are a superfamily of proteins sharing a conserved tertiary structure [1] that has evolved primarily to
control proteolytic activity, although some have evolved
non-inhibitory functions [2-6]. To date, over 500 serpin
sequences have been identified in the genomes of species
from almost all phyla including viruses, bacteria, metazoans and plants [1,7].

tive centre loop (RCL) is exposed at the top of the serpin
where it acts as a pseudosubstrate for the target proteinase
[9]. Following cleavage of the RCL, a conformational rearrangement, termed the stressed to relaxed transition,
occurs and the RCL inserts into a β-sheet forming an extra
β-strand [10]. This rearrangement is responsible for the
distortion and irreversible inactivation of the target proteinase [11].

The serpin mechanism of inhibition is based on the
metastable nature of the native serpin fold [8]. The reac-

Phylogenetic analysis has divided serpins into 16 clades
and a number of orphan sequences [1]. The clade B ser-

Distribution of clade B serpin genes in vertebrate genomes
Distribution of clade B serpin genes in vertebrate genomes. A dendrogram showing relationships between vertebrate
species with clade B serpin gene loci. The genes identified within each genome are indicated on the right without the SERPIN
root designation. Multiple loci are delineated by square brackets, while genes identified in EST databases, but not in the
genome, are in round brackets. * due to the incomplete nature of the sequencing data, the structure of the rabbit (Oryctolagus
cuniculus) loci could not be established. Branch lengths are not to scale.
pins are primarily intracellular proteinase inhibitors [12].
In humans this clade consists of 13 members and includes
regulators of inflammation, apoptosis and angiogenesis
(reviewed in [13]). The genes are arranged at two genomic
loci at 6p25 (3 genes: SERPINB1, SERPINB6 and
SEPINB9) and 18q21 (10 genes: SERPINB2, B3, B4, B5,
B7, B8, B10, B11, B12 and B13), and all clade B serpins
described to date conform to two related gene structures
of seven or eight exons. Both the phasing and positioning
of the intron/exon splice sites are identical for six introns,
leading to conserved exon lengths. The additional intron
splice site of the 8-exon structure is also conserved,
although the extra exon encodes a highly divergent
sequence of variable length, termed the CD loop.
Although clade B serpins have been identified in mammals (humans, mice and rats) as well as birds, it is not
known how they evolved, nor has the primordial structure
or gene been identified. Two competing models exist to
explain the presence of two clade B loci in humans. The
first proposes duplication of the entire 6p25 locus followed by a number of single gene duplications at 18q21

[14]. The second proposes duplication of a single gene
from 18q21 to 6p25, followed by successive duplications
at both loci to derive the modern complement [15]. Two
key differences are apparent between these models. The
former assumes that the 7-exon structure and 6p25 locus
are ancestral, whereas the latter assumes the opposite.
Here, we use the completed chicken genome to show that
the two mammalian loci are the result of an ancient chromosomal split, as orthologues of genes from both human
loci are linked in the chicken. Further analysis of emerging
genome sequences suggests that clade B serpin genes arose
from a primordial Serpinb1 or b6 gene with seven exons,
the additional exon being gained in Serpinb12 after the
divergence of amphibians and amniotes.

Results
Clade B serpin genes in the chicken (Gallus gallus)
To determine which of the two clade B serpin loci is ancestral, the chicken genome was investigated, as it represents
a distantly related species. This analysis was also recently
performed independently by another group, yielding sim-

ilar results [16]. As illustrated in Figure 2A, the chicken
genome contains a single clade B serpin locus on chromosome 2, composed of 10 genes, nine of which are supported by EST data. Both gene structures are also evident
within the locus. Single orthologues exist in the chicken
for the 7-exon human genes SERPINB1 (MNEI),
SERPINB5 (maspin) and SERPINB6 (PI6), and also for
the 8-exon genes SERPINB2 (PAI-2) and SERPINB12
(yukopin). Human SERPINB10 (bomapin), an 8-exon
gene, has 2 chicken homologues – MENT (which fits the
8-exon arrangement) and a MENT-like gene for which the
structure cannot be completely determined. The three
remaining chicken genes Serpinb14 (ovalbumin),
Serpinb14b (geneY) and Serpinb14c (geneX) are highly
related [17] and have no human orthologues. This suggests that the common ancestor of chickens and mammals had a complement of six clade B serpin genes:
SERPINB1, B2, B5, B6, B10 and B12. Furthermore, the
organization of the chicken clade B serpin locus matches
that of humans, contradicting both previously proposed
models of clade B serpin gene evolution. Rather than two
independently evolving loci, it suggests that both the 7and 8-exon gene structures evolved at a single locus in the
common ancestor of birds and mammals that then split to
yield the 2 loci apparent in humans and rodents.
Evolution of clade B serpin genes in vertebrates
Since both the 7 and 8-exon gene structures were present
in the chicken genome, we investigated more distantly
related genomes to identify which structure arose first.
Each of the 13 human protein sequences were used to
probe the current builds of vertebrate genomes to identify

clade B serpin genes. This identified genes with strong RCL
similarity to human clade B serpins in the genomes of
fish, amphibians and various mammals. By plotting the
presence of genes on a dendrogram of species a pattern of
gene evolution can be proposed (Figure 1).
As described above, the common ancestor of mammals
and birds contained a single clade B serpin gene locus of
six genes (Serpinb1, b2 b5, b6, b10 and b12). All of the
mammalian genomes examined so far (human, chimpanzee, dog, rat and mouse) contain two loci, suggesting that
the chromosomal split occurred early in mammalian evolution (Figure 1). The locus syntenic with human 6p25
contains SERPINB1, B6 and B9 in humans, chimpanzees,
and dogs and an expanded repertoire of 15 and 8 in mice
and rats, respectively [18,19], indicating further expansion within the rodent lineage. The incomplete rabbit
genome yielded hits for 10 of the human clade B serpins
(Serpinb3, b4 and b10 were not identified), with no evidence of the expansion observed in rats or mice. Furthermore, the Serpinb9 RCL sequence of rabbits is predicted to
match that of humans whereas the rodent Serpinb9 RCL is
mutated.
The locus syntenic to human 18q21 is identical between
mammals with the exception of the SERPINB3 and
SERPINB4 genes (SCCA-1 and -2), which are unique to
each species (data not shown and [20]). This suggests that
12 genes were present in the mammalian common ancestor – SERPINB1, B6 and B9 at one locus, and SERPINB2,
B5, B7, B8, B10, B11, B12, B13 and the primordial
SERPINB3/B4 at the other. Since then, the ancestral

SERPINB3/B4 has evolved independently in each mammalian species.
Further back in evolution, chickens and mammals shared
a common ancestor with amphibians approximately 300
million years ago, and the genome of Xenopus tropicalis
(the western clawed frog) provides an insight into this
more primitive gene cluster (Figure 1). The X. tropicalis
genome contains a single clade B serpin locus of 4 genes
(Serpinb1, Serpinb6, Serpinb5 and Serpinb12), bounded by
orthologues of WHIP and VPS4B. The placement of both
serpin and non-serpin genes is conserved between the frog
and chicken genomes, strengthening our hypothesis that
a single clade B serpin gene cluster has split at some point
in mammalian evolution (Figure 2A). Again, the phylogenetic tree confirms that clade B serpin genes cluster on the
basis of conserved function, rather than by species (Figure
2B).
450 million years ago, amphibians, birds and mammals
shared a common ancestor with fish [21]. Three fish

genomes were available for analysis: Danio rerio
(zebrafish), Tetraodon nigroviridis (green pufferfish) and
Takifugu rubripes (japanese pufferfish). The T. rubripes and
T. nigroviridis genomes each contain one or two copies of
Serpinb1, respectively, with no other serpin genes for over
100 kb upstream or downstream, while the D. rerio locus
contains two copies of Serpinb1, linked to two other genes
with RCL sequences that do not match any human serpins. However, ESTs derived from both Serpinb1 and
Serpinb6 can be identified from all three species, indicating the presence of another clade B serpin locus. Indeed, a
second locus is identifiable in the D. rerio and T. nigroviridis genomes. The T. nigroviridis locus contains only
Serpinb6, although the contig is very short and other genes
may exist. The D. rerio region contains a number of clade
B serpin gene fragments as well as a gene with RCL homology to human SERPINB12, although no orthologue of
SERPINB6 can be identified. However, the BAC clone finishes in intronic sequence between the final two exons of
a serpin gene, and therefore this fragment may be the 5'
region of D. rerio Serpinb6.

Gene structure
The gene structures of the newly identified genes from
Xenopus and fish were determined by alignment of ESTs
to genomic sequence as well as by GENSCAN predictions
(Table 2). Human SERPINB1 is a 7-exon gene, and this is
also the case for Serpinb1 in the three fish genomes investigated, as well as the novel genes identified in Danio
rerio. Lack of EST coverage resulted in an inability to
determine intron phasing for the T. nigroviridis and T.
rubripes genes, however, the positioning of the introns
within the predicted mRNA was consistent with the mammalian clade B serpins.

Overlapping ESTs allowed construction of complete
mRNA sequences for all 4 of the Xenopus genes. Serpinb1,
b5 and b6 conformed to the 7-exon structure, and both
positioning and phasing of the intron/exon boundaries
was conserved with humans. The other gene to appear in
frogs is Serpinb12, an 8-exon gene in the chicken and
mammalian genomes. However, this gene in frogs contained only 7-exons, lacking the extra exon encoding the
CD loop. This gene structure was confirmed by EST
DR880497 which spans all 6 intron/exon boundaries. As
shown in Figure 2B, Xenopus Serpinb12 is clearly related
to human and chicken Serpinb12, suggesting that the 8exon structure arose some time between the divergence of
amphibians and amniotes in the Serpinb12 gene.

Discussion
The human genome contains two clusters of clade B serpin genes at 6p25 and 18q21. The 13 genes all conform to
either a 7- or 8-exon gene structure with conservation of
both phasing and positioning of intron/exon boundaries.
To address possible mechanisms of clade B gene evolution, the chicken genome was analysed and found to contain a single clade B gene cluster of 10 genes. Another
recent investigation of the chicken genome also identified
these 10 genes, however, the authors concluded that the
newly identified MENT-like chicken gene, Serpinb10a, and
human SERPINB10 represented direct orthologues [16].
This was based on the overall protein similarity as well as
homology within the CD loop and RCL. While the RCL
sequence of chicken Serpinb10a and human SERPINB10
have some similarities, there are a number of charge differences throughout the RCL, and optimal alignment
requires insertion of a gap at the P side (N-terminal to the
point of proteolytic cleavage), a feature not observed
between other chicken-human orthologues. Furthermore,
although the presence of a CD loop would be predicted in
Serpinb10a given its evolutionary ancestry, the presence of
an eighth exon requires experimental proof. Without
direct sequencing of a transcript, it remains possible that
the exon may be missing or contain a premature stop
codon or mis-sense mutation resulting in a lack of functional protein expression. The exon identified by Benarafa

and Remold-O'Donnell had a very low statistical score
[16], and decreasing the GENSCAN settings to detect this
exon leads to the identification of a number of potential
exons in other serpin genes that are not transcribed (data
not shown).

netic analysis indicates that Danio Serpinb12 does not
cluster with Serpinb12 from other species, but rather with
Danio Serpinb6 (data not shown), and suggests that the
Danio rerio Serpinb12 gene may be a case of convergent
evolution.

The identification of orthologues (matching RCLs) of
both mammalian clusters (SERPINB2, SERPINB5 and
SERPINB12 from human 18q21 and SERPINB1 and
SERPINB6 from human 6p25) at a single genomic locus
in the chicken raises the intriguing possibility that the serpin clusters arose from an ancient chromosomal breakage, rather than chromosomal duplication events. More
distantly related genomes appear to support this conclusion as a single clade B serpin gene cluster exists in the
Xenopus tropicalis genome, consisting of Serpinb1, b5, b6
and b12. Therefore, the two loci observed in mammals
arose from this single cluster of four 7-exon genes.
Serpinb12 gained an extra exon and was duplicated to give
rise to the 8-exon genes, followed by a chromosomal split
yielding two loci. This presents a much simpler mechanism for the observation of different genetic structures at
a single locus than previously proposed models [14,15]
(Figure 3).

Six genes (Serpinb3/b4, b7, b8, b9, b11 and b13) were
gained early along the mammalian branch and the cluster
split into two loci, although when these events occurred in
relation to each other cannot currently be discerned. The
current effort to sequence the platypus (a monotreme)
genome, as well as a number of marsupials (the wallaby
and opossum), which branched off early in mammalian
evolution may shed some light on this.

Since Serpinb1 and Serpinb6 are linked in frogs, chickens
and humans, it is likely that they were linked in their common ancestor with fish, however, this was not the case in
any of the fish genomes investigated. This may be due to
a whole genome duplication that occurred early in the
evolution of ray finned fish, followed by rapid loss of
duplicate genes [22]. This could give rise to the two serpin
loci that have since evolved separately (Figure 4). Therefore, we propose that the single primordial serpin clade B
locus (in the common ancestor of fish and tetrapods) contained only Serpinb1 and Serpinb6, as these are the only
two genes identifiable in ESTs from multiple species of
fish. Following the whole genome duplication, one gene
was lost from each locus (resulting in one locus with
Serpinb1 and another with Serpinb6) and each of these loci
have since evolved uniquely in descendant fish species
(Figure 4). The fish family Polypteridae (bichirs) diverged
from teleost fish before the whole genome duplication
[22], and as such, a genomic analysis within this family
would be predicted to show a single 'primordial' clade B
serpin gene locus of Serpinb1 and Serpinb6.
The identification of a Serpinb12 homologue in the D.
rerio genome suggests that this gene may have evolved significantly earlier than the tetrapod lineage, however, no
corroborating ESTs can be found in other fish species. A
number of unique clade B serpins have evolved in
zebrafish, at both genomic loci, which cannot be found in
other fish genomes or EST databases, indicating a more
rapid evolution in this fish species. Furthermore, phyloge-

The analysis of frog Serpinb12 clearly shows that it is a 7exon gene, despite having eight exons in both chickens
and mammals. This shows that the 7-exon structure arose
first and that the eighth exon was gained in Serpinb12
some time after amphibians evolved, but before mammals and birds split. The gain of the CD loop has enabled
some members of the clade B serpin family to evolve
motifs for secondary functions, without affecting their
inhibitory role [23]. The AT-hook motif and nuclear localisation signal (NLS) of chicken MENT [3] are found in the
CD-loop, as is the NLS of human bomapin [24]. The
extended CD-loop of PAI-2 contains motifs necessary for
its suppression of tumour necrosis factor α induced death
[23], redox sensitivity [25,26] and cross-linking to cell
membranes [27,28] as well as a novel motif for binding to
retinoblastoma protein [29].
These analyses suggest that either Serpinb1 or Serpinb6 is
the original clade B serpin gene, and that it was present in
the common ancestor of euteleostomi (the bony vertebrates, including both fish and mammals) approximately
450 million years ago. A possible functional orthologue
of Serpinb6 is evident in the urochordate species Ciona
intestinalis (sea squirt). However, this gene does not contain any introns, although other serpin genes in the Ciona
genome do have introns. This makes it difficult to suggest
the Ciona Serpinb6 gene as a primordial clade B serpin.
Furthermore, the suggestion that clade B serpins evolved
from an intronless precursor would also be contrary to a
recent study suggesting that they arose from an introncontaining gene [30].
The question of where clade B genes arose may be
answered when the genomes of the skate and lamprey are
completely sequenced. These species diverged at different
times between the sea squirt-human and fish-human
common ancestors, and may indicate which gene,
Serpinb1 or Serpinb6, evolved first, and whether or not
clade B serpins are descendant from an intronless precursor.

Conclusion
By investigating the genomes of various vertebrate species,
we have shown that the all clade B serpins are descended
from a single gene (either Serpinb1 or Serpinb6) that contained seven exons. The additional exon present in the 8exon structure appeared in the Serpinb12 gene at some
point after the divergence of amphibians from amniotes,
but before the divergence of birds and mammals. Therefore, both the 7-exon and 8-exon genes evolved at a single
locus that split soon after birds and mammals diverged
two yield the two loci present in the human genome.

Methods
The current builds of vertebrate genomes [22,31-34] were
accessed through the NCBI and mined using BLAST [35].
The Xenopus tropicalis genome was accessed from the
Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute. Rabbit
genomic contigs were downloaded from the Broad Institute. GENSCAN [36] was also used to predict genes from
genomic sequence. Intron/exon boundaries were predicted with Spidey. Alignments were created using ClustalW [37] and manually adjusted with BioEdit (version
6.0.7). Phylogenetic relationships were determined using
the Neighbour-Joining method with 1,000 bootstraps and
trees were viewed with TreeView [38]. Accession numbers
for the sequences identified in this study are given in Table
1.
