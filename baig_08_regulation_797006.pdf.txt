Abstract
Background: Genomic RNA dimerization is an important process in the formation of an
infectious lentiviral particle. One of the signals involved is the stem-loop 1 (SL1) element located
in the leader region of lentiviral genomic RNAs which also plays a role in encapsidation and reverse
transcription. Recent studies revealed that HIV types 1 and 2 leader RNAs adopt different
conformations that influence the presentation of RNA signals such as SL1. To determine whether
common mechanisms of SL1 regulation exist among divergent lentiviral leader RNAs, here we
compare the dimerization properties of SIVmac239, HIV-1, and HIV-2 leader RNA fragments using
homologous constructs and experimental conditions. Prior studies from several groups have
employed a variety of constructs and experimental conditions.
Results: Although some idiosyncratic differences in the dimerization details were observed, we
find unifying principles in the regulation strategies of the three viral RNAs through long- and shortrange base pairing interactions. Presentation and efficacy of dimerization through SL1 depends
strongly upon the formation or dissolution of the lower stem of SL1 called stem B. SL1 usage may
also be down-regulated by long-range interactions involving sequences between SL1 and the first
codons of the gag gene.
Conclusion: Despite their sequence differences, all three lentiviral RNAs tested in this study
showed a local regulation of dimerization through the stabilization of SL1.

Background
The 5' untranslated region of the lentiviral genomic RNA
is replete with RNA signals involved in different stages of
the replication cycle, such as transcription transactivation,
polyadenylation, tRNA primer binding, dimerization,
encapsidation, splicing, and translation [1]. The RNA signals mediate viral functions through RNA-protein
(genomic RNA encapsidation and reverse transcription)
and RNA-RNA interactions (dimerization, tRNA hybridi-

zation to PBS). Although most of these signals can be
linked to a precise stage of the viral replication cycle, they
overlap structurally and functionally ([2-4]). For instance,
the stem-loop 1 (SL1) dimerization signal overlaps with
the genomic RNA encapsidation signal in HIV-2 ([5-8]).
Another interesting characteristic of retroviral leader RNA
signals is the fact that their presentation may vary during
the different stages of viral replication. For example, the
dimerization and encapsidation signals in Moloney

5' leader region of lentiviral genomic RNA and proposed structural conformations. The landmark sequences with
known functions of HIV-2 (A), SIV (B), and HIV-1 (C) leader RNAs are indicated by boxes with the names indicated above.
TAR, polyA signal, PBS, Ψ, SL1, SD, and gag represent the trans-activation region, the polyA signal domain, the primer-binding
site, the major encapsidation signal, the stem-loop 1, the major splice donor site, and the 5' end of the Gag protein coding
region, respectively. The numbering corresponds to the genomic RNA position. HIV-2 and SIV Ψ sequences correspond to nts
380–408, and 381–409, respectively ([8,53]). HIV-1 Ψ is represented by the stem-loop 3 structure (nts 312–325, [54]). D.
Schematics of the proposed conformations of leader RNAs that impair SL1-mediated dimerization are shown. HIV-1 leader
RNA can form an extensive, long-range base pairing interaction between the polyA signal and SL1 domains (called LDI) [17].
HIV-2 leader RNA can make a long-range base pairing interaction (called CGI for C-box – G-box interaction) between a
sequence located between the polyA and PBS domains and another one located at the gag translation initiation region (C-box
and G-box, respectively). Formation of CGI impairs SL1-mediated dimerization in HIV-2 ([21,25]). E. The proposed conformation of HIV-1 leader RNA that favors dimerization is characterized by a distinct branched multiple-hairpin structure (BMH) that
contains an intact CGI [17]. F. Representation of HIV-2/SIV (top) and HIV-1 (bottom) CGI base pairing models ([17,25]). Numbers and nucleotides in parentheses represent the SIV equivalent of HIV-2 numbers and nucleotides. The translation initiation

murine leukemia virus genomic RNA are proposed to be
initially masked and need to be activated by Gag proteindependent RNA structural rearrangements [9].
Electron microscopy studies of packaged genomic RNAs
revealed that the two RNA molecules are strongly associated with each other through their 5' ends, termed the
dimer linkage structure ([10,11]). In HIV-1, a short
sequence located in the 5' untranslated region that promotes dimerization of partial leader transcripts was identified and named the dimerization initiation site (DIS) or
stem-loop 1 (SL1) ([12-14]). The SL1 element maintains
two RNA molecules in a dimeric state in vitro, either
through a kissing-loop interaction, or an extended duplex
base pairing arrangement (for review, see [2-4]). Roles of
SL1 in the different stages of viral replication have been
characterized in cell culture (reviewed in [2], [15]). Initially proposed from in vitro results [12], the genomic RNA
dimerization initiation role of SL1 was recently confirmed
in HIV-1 [16]. A riboswitch model was proposed in which
extensive structural rearrangements of the whole leader
region could influence the presentation of SL1 (and other
RNA signals) and thus dimerization and packaging efficiencies [3]. In this model the HIV-1 leader RNA can
adopt two different conformations: a long-distance interaction (LDI) between the polyA signal and SL1 domains
and a distinct branched multiple-hairpin structure (BMH)
[17]. Several predicted conformations of the leader region
include base pairing between a C-rich sequence in the 5'
part of U5 and a G-rich sequence around the gag translation initiation region [17]. Here we call this interaction
CGI, for C-box – G-box interaction, to specifically indicate
this base pairing rather than an overall conformation of
the leader RNA such as LDI or BMH. Formation of CGI
favors the BMH conformer in HIV-1 and thus promotes
the presentation of SL1 as an efficient dimerization signal
([17,18]).
In vitro, two dimerization signals exist within the HIV-2
genomic RNA leader region ([19-22]). One signal
involves the 5' end of the tRNA-primer binding site (PBS)
([19,20]) and exhibits properties of loose dimerization
(previously defined in [23,24]). Because it overlaps with
the PBS, its role in viral replication, if any, could only
occur before the hybridization of the tRNA primer during
the formation of the viral particle ([19,20]). Although the
second HIV-2 dimerization signal is homologous to the
element SL1 in HIV-1 leader RNA, its efficiency as a tight
dimerization element is suboptimal in large HIV-2 RNA
constructs encompassing the whole 5' untranslated leader
region ([19-21]). We and others showed that the impaired
tight dimerization phenotype correlated with the formation of the CGI long-range base pairing interaction (Figure
1) ([21,25]). We proposed that, contrary to HIV-1, formation of CGI favors intramolecular entrapment of SL1 and

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/5/1/65

thus decreases its use as a tight dimerization signal in HIV2 RNA ([25,26]). Indeed, an in vitro evolution analysis
revealed that the SL1 region adopts discrete conformations with different dimerization abilities [27]. Compared
to HIV-1 and HIV-2, little is known about RNA dimerization in SIVs [19].
To determine whether common mechanisms of SL1 regulation exist among divergent lentiviral leader RNAs, we
compared the dimerization properties of SIVmac239,
HIV-1, and HIV-2 leader RNA fragments using homologous constructs and experimental conditions. Overall, it
appears that SIV, HIV-1, HIV-2 RNAs have several common features with regard to SL1-mediated dimerization,
which points to conserved regulation mechanisms by
homologous RNA structures. Truncation analysis revealed
that tight dimerization of the three lentiviral leader RNAs
is modulated by interactions of nucleotides located
between SL1 and the first codons of the gag open reading
frame that affect both SL1 presentation and overall leader
conformation. Most important, all three lentiviral RNAs
tested in this study demonstrated a local regulation of
dimerization through the stabilization of SL1 by its lower
stem structure called stem B.

Methods
Template construction for in vitro transcription
A sense primer containing a BamHI site and the promoter
for the T7 RNA polymerase and an antisense primer containing an EcoRI site (Table 1) were used to amplify the
first 437, 444, or 561 nucleotides of HIV-2 genomic RNA
sequence, ROD isolate (nt 1 of the genomic RNA
sequence corresponds to nt 1 of [GenBank:M15390]), and
the first 435, 441, or 550 nucleotides of SIV genomic RNA
sequence, mac239 isolate (nt 1 of the genomic RNA
sequence corresponds to nt 775 of [GenBank:M33262]).
The extended stem B mutation was introduced into a 1–
444 HIV-2 ROD sequence using a modified antisense
primer (HIV2 asMUT444Eco, Table 1). This mutation is a
substitution of nts G437-T438 by the sequence CTTTCTA.
DNA template plasmids containing the first 272, 277, or
373 nucleotides of HIV-1 NL4-3 genomic RNA and a T7
RNA polymerase promoter were constructed using a similar strategy (nt 1 of the genomic RNA sequence corresponds to nt 455 of [GenBank:AF324493]). The numbers
used to define RNA constructs (for instance 1–561 HIV-2
RNA) are based on genomic RNA numbering. The HIV-2
ROD DNA template (modified plasmid pROD10) was
provided by the EU Programme EVA/MRC Centralised
Facility for AIDS Reagents, NIBSC, UK (Grant Number
QLK2-CT-1999-00609 and GP828102). The SIV mac239
(p239SpSp5' plasmid) and HIV-1 (p83-2 plasmid) DNA
templates were obtained from Dr. Ronald Desrosiers
through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program ([28-30]). The digested polymerase chain reaction

products were cloned in the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the
pUC18 plasmid.
RNA synthesis and purification
The different plasmids were linearized with EcoRI prior to
in vitro transcription. RNAs were synthesized by in vitro
transcription of the EcoRI-digested plasmids with the
AmpliScribe T7 transcription kit (Epicentre). After transcription, the DNA was digested with the supplied RNasefree DNase, and the RNA was purified by ammonium acetate precipitation followed by size exclusion chromatography (Bio-Gel P-4, Bio-Rad).
In vitro dimerization of SIV, HIV-1, and HIV-2 RNAs
Five to eight pmol of RNA were denatured in 8 μl water for
2 minutes at 90°C and quench cooled on ice for 2 minutes. After the addition of 2 μl buffer M (HIV-1 dimer
buffer; final concentrations: 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 at
37°C, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2) or buffer H (HIV-2 or
SIV dimer buffer; final concentrations: 50 mM Tris-HCl
pH 7.5 at 37°C, 300 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2), dimerization
was allowed to proceed for 30 minutes or up to eight
hours at 55°C. The optimal tight dimerization conditions
for HIV-2 require high salt buffer [25]. The optimal HIV-1
tight dimerization conditions are broader and tight dimers can form in lower salt conditions ([24,31]). Here we
have used medium salt buffer for the HIV-1 dimerization
to make the dimerization conditions homologous to the
HIV-2/SIV conditions. We used 55°C since the incubation
of HIV-1 and HIV-2 RNAs at 55°C allows formation of
SL1-mediated tight dimers ([20,23,24]). In order to load
all incubations at the same time, long extended incubations (Figure 2) were started in inverted order, that is, the
longest incubation first. To avoid volume changes of the
dimerization mixture due to water condensation under
the lid of the reaction tube, the long extended incubations
were done at 55°C in a PCR machine with heating lid.
When assaying the early stages of dimerization with large
RNA constructs, we used 30 min as standard incubation
time [26].

The samples were then cooled on ice to stabilize dimers
formed during incubation and loaded on a 0.8% agarose
gel with 2 μl glycerol loading dye 6× (40% glycerol, Trisborate 44 mM pH 8.3, 0.25% Bromophenol blue). Electrophoresis was carried out at 3 V/cm for 2 hours at room
temperature (26°C) in Tris-borate 44 mM pH 8.3, EDTA
1 mM (TBE). After electrophoresis, the ethidium bromidestained gel was scanned on a Fluorescent Image Analyzer
FLA-3000 (Fujifilm).
Analysis of regulatory RNA signals using antisense
oligonucleotides
Five pmol of RNA with or without 100 pmol of oligonucleotide (Table 2) were denatured in 8 μl water for 2 minutes at 90°C and quench cooled on ice for 2 minutes.
After the addition of 2 μl fivefold concentrated dimer
buffer, dimerization was allowed to proceed for 30 minutes at 55°C. The samples were then cooled on ice to stabilize dimers formed during incubation and loaded on a
0.8% TBE agarose gel. Electrophoresis was carried out for
90 minutes at 26°C and 3 V/cm. After electrophoresis, the
ethidium bromide-stained gel was scanned on a Fluorescent Image Analyzer FLA-3000 (Fujifilm).
Kinetics of tight dimer formation
Fifty pmol of RNA with or without one nmol of antisense
oligonucleotide (Table 2) were denatured in 80 μl water
for 2 minutes at 90°C and quench cooled on ice for 2
minutes. After the addition of 2 μl 5× dimer buffer under
the lid of 10 tubes, 8 μl of denaturated RNA was aliquoted
to each tube. The dimerization was started by a 5 second
spin in a bench top centrifuge followed by immediate
loading of the tubes in a heating block at 55°C. Dimerization was allowed to proceed for 2 to 16 minutes. At each
time point a tube containing 10 μl of reaction mixture was
removed from the heating block, mixed with 2 μl glycerol
loading dye 6× and loaded on a 0.8% agarose TBE gel.
Electrophoresis was carried out at room temperature
(26°C) and 3 V/cm. After electrophoresis, the ethidium
bromide-stained gel was scanned on a Fluorescent Image

nificant cleavage was not observed in the HIV-2 or SIV
RNAs during extended incubation (Figure 2), which
allowed us to rule out an obvious RNase contamination,
since most of the buffers, transcription components were
shared between all RNAs tested in this study.
The relative inefficiency of HIV-2 and SIV RNA tight
dimerization suggested that the presentation of SL1 was
not optimal in these RNAs. Though more efficient than
HIV-2 and SIV, the yield of HIV-1 tight dimerization during the first hour was low (Figure 2C). Since SL1 presentation is modulated by short- and long-range interactions in
HIV-2 ([21,25-27]) or HIV-1 [34], we hypothesize that coincubation of lentiviral leader RNAs with antisense oligonucleotides directed against these modulating interactions may improve SL1 presentation and thus increase
tight dimerization.

The tight dimerization of HIV-2 1–561 RNA was similar to
what has been previously described ([19,20]). Only a
minor fraction of RNA molecules dimerized after 30 or 60
min (Figure 2A, compare lane 1 to lanes 2 and 3). Indeed,
the dimerization yield was less than 50% after an eight
hour incubation at 55°C (Figure 2A, lane 7). The tight
dimerization of 1–550 SIV RNA was similar to HIV-2,
with a slightly lower level of tight dimers formed after
extended incubation (Figure 2B).

Analysis of long-range regulatory interactions using
antisense oligonucleotides
SL1-mediated dimerization can be regulated by longrange interactions (LDI in HIV-1 [35] or C-box – G-box
interaction (CGI) in HIV-1 and HIV-2 ([21,25,35]) and
short-range interactions (Ψ encapsidation signal in HIV-2
[26]) (Figures 1D, 1E and 1F). To determine the relative
importance of short- and long-range interactions in modulating SL1-mediated tight dimerization of lentiviral
RNAs, we tested the effects of antisense oligonucleotides
directed against the known RNA elements that regulate
SL1-mediated tight dimerization in HIV-2 [26]. We and
others demonstrated that the impaired phenotype of HIV2 tight dimerization correlated with the formation of the
long-range CGI ([21,25]). The CGI is formed through
base pairing of a sequence located in the 5' part of U5 and
the gag translation initiation region (C-box and G-box,
respectively, Figure 1F) ([21,25]). Antisense oligonucleotides directed against the C-box or G-box elements (asC
and asG, respectively) greatly increased the dimerization
yield of 1–561 HIV-2 RNA, but not 1–550 SIV RNA after a
30 min-incubation (Figure 3A, compare lanes 2–4 to 7–
9).

The formation of HIV-1 RNA dimers, measured by the disappearance of the monomer RNA species, was twice as
efficient as HIV-2 or SIV over the whole eight hour experiment, although the interpretation of longer time points
was made more difficult by the appearance of two other
RNA species that appeared after two hours. One band
migrated between the monomer and dimer bands and
another one was below the monomer band (Figure 2C).
Though we cannot rule out that a small fraction of these
RNA species represent fast-migrating conformers, electrophoretic analysis of these reactions under denaturing conditions revealed that the majority of these RNA species
represent cleaved RNA molecules (data not shown). Sig-

Similar to SIV, the incubation of 1–373 HIV-1 RNA with
the homologous oligonucleotides showed no effect (40%
of tight dimers with or without oligonucleotides; Figure
3A, lanes 11 to 15). Experiments using radioactive oligonucleotides or RNase H cleavage assay [36] confirmed
that the oligonucleotides bind the HIV-1 RNA effectively
and at the expected locations (data not shown). The lack
of effect of asC oligonucleotide binding on HIV-1 dimerization suggests that the formation of the LDI structure was
minimal in our experiments. Likewise, the lack of effect of
asG oligonucleotide binding suggests that disruption of
the BMH structure did not promote either LDI or tight
dimer formation. Thus, contrary to HIV-2, disruption of

the first several codons of the gag open reading frame of
the genomic RNA (Methods, Figure 1). Tight dimers withstand dissociation during semi-native gel electrophoresis
(Tris-borate EDTA (TBE) buffer at 26°C). By contrast,
loose dimers are detected only by using native conditions,
since they dissociate upon loading in semi-native TBE/
26°C gels [33]. Loose dimers are thought to correspond to
a loop-loop interaction between two SL1 motifs, whereas
tight dimers are thought to represent a more extensive
SL1–SL1 interaction due to the intra- to intermolecular
conversion of the stems located below the SL1 loop
([2,4]).

CGI with antisense oligonucleotides did not have an effect
on SIV and HIV-1 RNA tight dimerization. This suggests
that, besides CGI, stronger local regulatory interactions
may impair the use of SL1 as a tight dimer element in SIV
and HIV-1.
Analysis of short-range regulatory interactions using
antisense oligonucleotides
To test whether local base pairing in the SL1 region affects
tight dimerization, we used an antisense oligonucleotide
directed against the 5' stem B of SL1 and sequences
upstream (as Ψ for HIV-2 and SIV, as246 for HIV-1, Table
2 and Figure 3A). Stem B represents the lower stem of the
SL1 structure [14]. The impetus for this experiment came
from previous observations of local regulation of SL1mediated dimerization in HIV-2 RNA [26]. Incubation of
HIV-2 1–561 RNA with an oligonucleotide binding to the
loop and 5' stem of SL1 induced dimerization mediated
by the 10-nt autocomplementary sequence (pal: 5'-392GGAGUGCUCC-401) located in the HIV-2 encapsidation
signal Ψ (Figure 3C, lane 3). Likewise, incubation of SIV
and HIV-1 RNAs with the homologous asΨ and as246 oligonucleotides improved tight dimerization (Figure 3C,
lanes 7 and 12). Co-incubation with the anti-SL1 oligonucleotide (asSL1, Table 2) confirmed that the increased
tight dimerization was SL1-dependent (Figure 3C, lanes 4,
9, 14). Thus, the region upstream of SL1 including stem B
has a negative effect on lentiviral tight dimerization. However, the different levels of tight dimers formed in the
absence of oligonucleotides, (Figures 2 and 3) indicate
that different SL1 sequences may also influence dimerization properties of lentiviral RNAs.
Chimeric RNAs reveal SL1 loop sequence affects tight
dimerization
While there is strong sequence homology between HIV-2
ROD and SIV mac239 isolates [37], their SL1 sequences
differ, especially stem C and the loop, which could influence dimerization rates. To test if the SIV SL1 sequence
might contribute to the impaired tight dimerization independently of CGI, we built chimeras between HIV-2 and
SIV SL1 in the context of partial leader RNA fragments (1–
444 and 1–441 RNAs for HIV-2 and SIV, respectively). We
used smaller RNAs so that sequences between SL1 and the
first codons of the gag gene would not influence tight
dimerization directly or indirectly ([20,22]). To build chimeric RNAs, SL1 sequences in 1–444 HIV-2 (nts 409 to
436) and 1–441 SIV (nts 410 to 433) RNAs were substituted by the SIV and HIV-2 SL1 homologs, respectively.
We measured the apparent tight dimerization rate at 55°C
of all four RNA constructs (Figure 4). The wild type 1–444
HIV-2 RNA was the fastest to dimerize (kdim = 0.11 ± 0.024
μM-1min-1), while the wild type 1–441 SIV RNA was the
slowest (kdim = 0.013 ± 0.004 μM-1min-1, Figure 4C). In
fact, introducing SIV SL1 in HIV-2 RNA decreased the

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/5/1/65

dimerization rate two-fold, and introducing HIV-2 SL1 in
SIV RNA increased the dimerization rate two-fold (Figure
4).
Thus, the difference of only a few nucleotides in the SL1
sequence influences tight dimerization rates in SIV and
HIV-2 RNAs. However, the incomplete correlation
between the SL1 sequence and the dimerization yield in
the chimeric RNAs indicates that other features of the
leader RNA, like the stem B element, may influence the
formation of tight dimers.
Stem B affects the tight dimerization rate in lentiviral
RNAs
To test whether formation of stem B directly affects SL1mediated dimerization, we used the antisense oligonucleotides directed against the region upstream of SL1, including the 5' stem B (Figure 5A and Table 2). We previously
showed that binding of the asΨ oligonucleotide increased
the tight dimerization yield of 1–561 HIV-2 RNA by favoring SL1 presentation (Figure 3C and [26]). As described
above, we used smaller RNAs so that the 3' end of the
leader region (through CGI or LDI/BMH) would not
influence tight dimerization. Although 1–444 HIV-2 RNA
was shown to dimerize well in the absence of oligonucleotides ([20,22]), its rate more than doubled upon asΨ
binding (Figures 5B and 5C). Interestingly, binding of the
SIV asΨ oligonucleotide dramatically promoted the rate
of SIV RNA dimer formation to a level similar to the one
achieved using the asΨ oligonucleotide on HIV-2 RNA
(18-fold increase; Figures 5B and 5C). Binding of the asΨhomologous antisense oligonucleotide (as246) to 1–277
HIV-1 RNA also increased its tight dimerization rate fivefold, to a level similar to SIV and HIV-2 RNAs co-incubated with asΨ (Figures 5B and 5C).

Thus, binding of antisense oligonucleotides directed
against the 5' side of stem B and nucleotides upstream
increased the tight dimerization rate for all three lentiviral
RNAs tested in this study. However, the rates without oligonucleotide differ and may be related to individual properties of the different lentiviral SL1s, including the apical
loop, stem B, and adjacent sequences (Figure 4).
Stability of stem B modulates the formation temperature
of lentiviral RNA tight dimers
To examine the role of stem B stability on tight dimerization, we tested the influence of the incubation temperature on dimerization of RNA constructs ending after stem
B (1–444 HIV-2, 1–441 SIV, and 1–277 HIV-1 RNAs) and
in constructs lacking the 3' side of stem B (1–437 HIV-2,
1–435 SIV, and 1–272 HIV-1 RNAs). After denaturation
and quench-cooling, the RNAs were incubated in dimer
buffer for 30 minutes at temperatures ranging from 24° to
60°C (see Methods). The truncation of 3'-stem B induced

Influence of incubation temperature and stem B truncation on lentiviral leader RNA tight dimerization

Influence of incubation temperature and stem B truncation on lentiviral leader RNA tight dimerization. The
RNAs tested in panel A include the entire stem B (1–444 HIV-2, 1–441 SIV, and 1–277 HIV-1) and in panel B exclude the 3'
side of stem B (1–437 HIV-2, 1–435 SIV, and 1–272 HIV-1) (see Figure 5, top panel, for structural details). A and B. All RNAs
were individually incubated at the indicated temperatures (24°, 37°, 40°, 45°, 50°, 55°, and 60°C) for 30 min in their corresponding dimer buffer and subjected to electrophoresis on TBE agarose gel run at 26°C. Lane 1 represents monomeric RNA

buffer H and subjected to electrophoresis on TBE agarose gel run at 26°C. The extension of SL1 is caused by the substitution
of nts G437-U438 by the sequence 5'-CUUUCUA-3' (right panel, boxed letters). This mutation doubles the stability of the SL1
region, from -18.2 to -36.4 kcal/mol (ΔGs of wild type and mutated 1–444 HIV-2 RNAs, respectively).

a shift of the tight dimers temperature profile for all three
RNAs (Figure 6). The temperature necessary to form 50%
dimers after a 30-min incubation was between 37° and
40°C for 3'-stem-containing RNAs, but closer to room
temperature (24°C) for RNAs missing 3'-stem B (Figure 6,
compare panels A and B). The temperature effect suggests
that disruption of stem B base pairing occurs during the
formation of tight dimers.

Because disruption of stem B was shown to stimulate tight
dimerization, we hypothesized that artificially stabilizing
stem B would have the opposite effect. We thus substituted nts G437-U438 in 1–444 HIV-2 RNA with the
sequence CUUUCUA and called this mutant 1–444
extended SL1 HIV-2 RNA. This mutation extends the stem
of the SL1 structure to include stem B through WatsonCrick base pairing (Figure 6C) and consequently doubles

Schematic of the different short- and long-range RNA interactions that regulate lentiviral SL1-mediated dimerization
Figure 7
Schematic of the different short- and long-range RNA interactions that regulate lentiviral SL1-mediated
dimerization. Three short- and long-range RNA structures can regulate SL1-mediated tight dimerization in HIV-2, SIV, and
HIV-1. A. LDI (long-distance interaction) is an extensive, long-range base pairing interaction between the U5 and SL1 domains
that causes a large rearrangement of the leader RNA structure [17]. SL1 is completely sequestered and thus unable to initiate
dimerization. B. CGI (C-box – G-box interaction) is a long-range base pairing interaction between a sequence in U5 and the
gag translation initiation region (called C-box and G-box, respectively). Formation of CGI impairs SL1-mediated dimerization in
HIV-2 ([21,25]), and favors it in HIV-1 [17]. C. Stem B is the lower stem of SL1 and has important roles during viral replication
in HIV-1 ([43,45]), HIV-2 ([6,7]), and SIV ([50,51]). Stem B-mediated SL1 entrapment may have twin roles in the regulation of
lentiviral leader RNA dimerization since promoting SL1 presentation by increasing its folding stability (Table 3) may favor the
formation of SL1 loop/loop (i.e. loose) dimers, while impairing the transition from loose to tight dimers.

the stability of the SL1 region, from -18.2 to -36.4 kcal/
mol (ΔGs of wild type and mutated RNAs, respectively;
Table 3). The ΔG values correspond to the optimal secondary structure of 396–444 HIV-2 RNAs with or without
the mutation using Mfold version 3.2 ([38,39]). The 1–
444 HIV-2 RNA with the extended SL1 was incubated for
30 min at temperatures ranging from 24° to 70°C (Figure
6C). Its tight dimerization yields were very low at almost
all temperatures; only the 70°C incubation showed an
increase in dimer yield (Figure 6C). Thus, the increase in
stability of the SL1 domain in the mutated 1–444 HIV-2
RNA correlated with a decrease in tight dimerization.

Discussion
The leader RNA of lentiviruses contains signals involved
in different stages of the replication cycle and most of
these signals are conserved between primate lentiviruses.
SL1 is involved in dimerization and encapsidation of the
genomic RNA ([2,4,15]), and is located between the PBS
domain and the major splice donor site in the 5' untranslated leader region of all spliced and unspliced lentiviral
RNA species (Figure 1).
The SL1 region of HIV-2 RNA has important roles in
dimerization and encapsidation and we have documented its ability to be sequestered or presented both in
vitro and during viral replication ([6,26,27]). Here we

examined the dimerization properties of three primate
lentiviral RNAs, HIV-2, SIV, and HIV-1, to search for common mechanistic themes in the regulation of SL1-mediated dimerization. The 5' untranslated leader RNA regions
of HIV-2 ROD and SIV mac239 are similar in size and
sequence [37], but our initial experiments showed that in
vitro SIV RNA dimerization is slightly less efficient and,
contrary to HIV-2 RNA, antisense oligonucleotides
directed against CGI failed to enhance tight dimerization.
Furthermore, different presentations of HIV-2 and SIV Ψ/
SL1 region may partially explain the fact that they exhibit
non-reciprocal cross packaging of genomic RNA in cell
culture [40]. HIV-1 is phylogenetically more distant [37]
and although its RNA dimerization properties have been
more extensively studied, the present work aimed to
directly compare dimerization regulation using standardized, homologous RNA constructs and experimental conditions. We demonstrated that SL1-mediated tight
dimerization of three primate lentiviral RNAs can be regulated by a specific short-range (stem B) interaction and
by a long-range interaction involving the 3' end of the
leader RNA through either CGI-dependent (HIV-2) or
CGI-independent (HIV-1 and SIV) mechanisms (Figure
7).
Tight dimerization efficiency of primate lentiviral RNAs
We and others previously reported the low efficiency of
HIV-2 leader RNA tight dimerization when its 3' end
encompasses the gag initiation region ([21,25]). The
impaired dimerization correlated with the formation of
the CGI structure (Figure 1) ([21,25]). We proposed that
the formation of HIV-2 CGI favors a structural intramolecular entrapment of SL1 during RNA folding and thus
decreases its use as a tight dimerization signal in vitro (Figure 1D) ([25,26]).

Although extended kinetic analysis revealed an impaired
dimerization phenotype of 1–550 SIV RNA, the lack of
effect of antisense oligonucleotides directed against CGI
underscored an unexpected difference between SIV and
HIV-2 leader RNAs, despite their sequence homology.
Indeed, CGI-independent intramolecular local folding
events may compete with dimerization more effectively in
SIV than in HIV-2 RNA. Similar to SIV, 1–373 HIV-1 RNA
dimerization was not influenced by the binding of antisense oligonucleotides directed against CGI, although its
yield without oligonucleotide was higher than HIV-2 or
SIV. Notably, the dimerization rate for each RNA was
markedly enhanced by truncation from the full-length
leader to shorter versions that end after SL1 (compare Figures 2 and 5) suggesting a conserved modulatory role for
downstream leader sequences.

Stem B and lentiviral SL1-mediated dimerization
A unifying principle in the regulation of lentiviral RNA
dimerization is the role of the lower stem of SL1, called
stem B (Figures 5 and 7). We hypothesized that stem B
exerts significant influence on lentiviral RNA dimerization for several reasons. First, stem B is highly conserved
in all three lentiviral genomes sequences considered in
this study ([22,41,42]). Second, recent reports have confirmed that short-distance interactions involving
sequences located upstream of SL1 could regulate HIV-2
dimerization in vitro [27] and in cell culture [7]. Third,
stem B was shown to have roles at several stages of HIV-1
replication, including genomic RNA dimerization ([4345]).

In this study we showed that all three tested lentiviral species RNAs exhibited local regulation of dimerization
through the stabilization of SL1 by stem B (Figure 5 and
Table 3). We propose that stem B-mediated SL1 entrapment may have twin roles in the regulation of lentiviral
leader RNA dimerization (Figure 7). First, it increases the
probability of SL1 to fold as a discrete secondary structure,
thus favoring SL1 loop/loop (loose) dimerization. It has
been shown that HIV-1 stem B promotes SL1-mediated
loose dimerization by favoring the correct presentation of
the apical autocomplementary sequence ([43,46]). Second, promoting SL1 presentation by increasing its stability may have a thermodynamic cost for tight dimer
formation. The thermodynamic cost might be compensated in vivo by the presence of the loop B structure in SL1.
Indeed, several laboratories have shown that loop B
(located between stems B and C, Figure 5A) favors temperature- or nucleocapsid-mediated dimerization by helping
the transition from loose to tight dimers ([47-49]).
Several studies analyzed the roles of SL1 in genomic RNA
dimerization and the nature of SL1–SL1 interaction in vivo
but a comprehensive model has not yet been established,
due to divergent results from several laboratories. SL1 was
shown to promote HIV-1 (reviewed in [2]) and SIV
([50,51]) genomic RNA dimerization during viral encapsidation. Accordingly, Laughrea and colleagues proposed
a model of HIV-1 genomic RNA dimerization wherein SL1
acts as a genomic RNA dimerization initiation signal that
evolves to tight dimers [16]. Alternatively, Hu and colleagues showed that SL1 is involved in HIV-1 genomic
RNA selection and recombination through intermolecular
base pairing limited to SL1 loop-loop interaction [52]. It
is possible that the apparent divergent results of both
studies are due to different experimental conditions.
Indeed, Laughrea and colleagues showed that SL1 is
involved in the early stages of genomic RNA encapsidation, that is, in the first hours of viruses maturation after
their release from the cell (five hours or less, [16]). They
suggested that slow-acting dimerization site(s) mask the

Page 13 of 16

Retrovirology 2008, 5:65

phenotype of SL1 mutants in "older" viruses (24 hours
and older, [16]). Since Hu and colleagues harvested
viruses after 24 hours of culture [52], the majority of their
genomic RNAs may have been matured by slow-acting
dimerization site(s), which may explain why most of their
SL1 mutations were phenotypically silent. In HIV-2, Lever
and colleagues showed that the HIV-2 palindromic
sequence pal had more importance for genomic RNA
dimerization during viral encapsidation than the palindromic sequence in the loop of SL1 [7].
Therefore, stem B of SL1 is likely a key regulating element
for different conformations of lentiviral leader RNAs, akin
to the concept of the riboswitch, proposed in HIV-1 by
Berkhout and colleagues [3]. Disrupting stem B is detrimental to many stages of HIV-1 ([43,45]), HIV-2 ([6,7]),
and SIV ([50,53]) replication. Remarkably, this extended
SL1 structure means that there is a structural overlap
between the Ψ encapsidation signal and the core of the
SL1 dimerization element in both SIV and HIV-2. Recent
reports of stem B effects on dimerization [7] and encapsidation [6] support a functional linkage between these two
viral functions in HIV-2.

Conclusion
This study demonstrates the ubiquity of structural entrapment as a mechanism of regulation of dimerization
among primate lentiviruses and provides a framework for
understanding dimerization data in each system through
local and long-range RNA arrangements. The 3' leader
region exerts an inhibitory effect on lentiviral RNA dimerization by altering the presentation of SL1. Stem B
strongly influences SL1 presentation in all three lentiviral
RNAs tested in this study. Because a similar set of folding
rules can be used to explain the behaviors of three distinct
primate lentiviral RNAs in vitro, it is likely that these discrete conformational changes represent a conserved regulatory mechanism in vivo.
In particular, it will be of interest to study the effect of CGI
or stem B mutations on packaging and gag translation in
mutant viruses in cell culture. Conformational changes
like the ones described here may help determine the fate
of viral RNA with respect to genomic and/or translational
duties. Indeed, such viral riboswitches would be expected
to be regulated by RNA chaperones like the viral nucleocapsid or Gag proteins and might be influenced by translational events, like ribosomal scanning.
