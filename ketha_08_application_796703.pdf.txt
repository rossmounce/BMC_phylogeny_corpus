Abstract
Background: Two nuclear localization sequences (NLS) in influenza A virus nucleoprotein (NP)
have been demonstrated to be critical for nuclear import of NP and viral ribonucleoprotein
complexes. However, a deletion mutant lacking these two signals was still able to localize to the
nucleus suggesting the presence of yet another (a third) potential NLS in the NP protein. In order
to identify the nature of this potential NLS signal in the NP of a WS/33L influenza virus A strain,
we utilized the tools of bioinformatics coupled with functional experimental analyses in the present
study.
Results: Comparison of the deduced aa sequence of NP of WS/33L strain with the published WS/
33 NP sequences revealed that a single amino acid (aa) change (Met to Arg) at position 105 results
in converting the flanking regions (between aa position 90–121, a 32-residue stretch) into two
classical overlapping bipartite NLS (obpNLS). GenBank search revealed that 9 out of 500 published
NP sequences contain a similar Arg at position 105 (instead of Met) with a 100% homology to the
obpNLS region. Various NP-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion constructs with and without
the signal (obpNLS-Arg105) were utilized to understand the functional nature of this signal. We
analyzed the transport competency of the expressed chimeric proteins in terms of their cellular
localization by confocal immunofluorescence assay. Our analysis revealed that all NP-GFP
constructs containing the wild-type (R105) sequence localized predominantly to the nucleus.
Constructs lacking the obpNLS or constructs with reverse mutation (R105 to M105) on the other
hand exhibited predominant cytoplasmic localization pattern. Interestingly, when the 32 aa obpNLS
was fused with an unrelated viral protein (rotavirus NSP6) that has been known to be cytoplasmic
protein, the chimeric protein (obpNLS-NSP6) was efficiently transported into the nucleus,
indicating an efficient nuclear transport function of the 32-residue obpNLS in the NP of WS/33L
strain of influenza A virus.
Conclusion: This report while not only establishing a new NLS in the influenza A virus strain, it
also reinforces the idea that proper application of bioinformatics-coupled experimental analysis
serves as a powerful tool in identifying new functional signals in proteins of interest.

Background
Influenza A virus is a negative-stranded RNA virus with 8
genomic segments coding for at least 11 proteins [1].
Gene segment 5 encodes the 498-amino acids (aa) long
nucleoprotein (NP) that has been shown to be a multifunctional protein with critical roles during various stages
of the viral life cycle. The viral RNA tightly bind to NP and
polymerase subunit proteins, PB1, PB2 and PA, resulting
in the formation of viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) a
prerequisite for successful transcription and replication
[1-5]. The primary role of NP as an RNA-binding protein
and thus its role as a structural protein contributing
towards the formation of the RNP complex within the virion is clearly evident. However, it is the series of events
following infection that delineates the major function of
NP, which mainly constitute importing of the vRNP complex into nucleus, then exporting it back to cytoplasm,
and finally preventing their reentry into nucleus [1-3,610]. Interaction of NP with several other viral and host
proteins is critical for this nuclear import and export
[1,11-13].
Nuclear import of NP is regulated by two nuclear localization signals (NLS), a non-conventional NLS (nNLS) and a
classical NLS (cNLS) present within the NP
[3,8,10,14,15]. A nuclear import signal in a protein is
characterized by one (monopartite) or two (bipartite)
short stretches of basic amino acids [16-18]. The monopartite signals comprise of two types: 4 residue pattern
(called "pat4") or the 7 residue pattern (called "pat7").
Pat4 NLS comprises of either a stretch of 4 basic amino
acids (K or R) or 3 basic amino acids (K or R) with the
fourth aa being either H or P. Pat7 is a pattern starting
with P and followed within 3 residues by a basic segment
containing 3 K/R residues out of 4. Thus, based on the
above classification the nNLS of NP (3SxGTKRSYxxM13,
important residues highlighted in bold) is aptly termed
non-conventional NLS as it does not fall under both pat4
or pat7 type of signals [13,14]. The second NLS of NP
(cNLS) on the other hand though, has been classified as a
bipartite signal (198KRGINDRNFWRGENGRKTR216,
important residues highlighted in bold) and is located
near the middle of the polypeptide [15-18]. Deletion and
mutation analysis of both the nNLS and cNLS reveal that
these signals are essential for nuclear import, viral mRNA
synthesis, vRNA transcription, replication and nucleolar
accumulation [3,7,8,10,13-15]. Interestingly, a mutant
NP lacking both of these NLSs was still transported to the
nucleus suggesting the existence of at least one additional
NLS between the cNLS and C-terminus region of NP
[8,14].
We report here a third novel overlapping bipartite NLS
(obpNLS) in the NP of WS/33L strain located between the
nNLS and cNLS regions identified by bioinformatic anal-

yses. Our analysis revealed a single amino acid change (M
to R) at position 105 resulted in converting a 32-aa stretch
into two obpNLS (90KKTGGPIYRRVDGKWRR106 and
105RRELILYDKEEIRRIWR121, residues constituting bpNLS
are in bold). Using full-length and deletion constructs of
NP in fusion with GFP, we present experimental evidence
that the obpNLS is indeed a stand alone functional transport signal and supports efficient translocation of the chimeric protein to the nucleus. Furthermore, comparative
analysis of 500 NP sequences revealed that 9 influenza
virus strains contain NP with similar aa change (R instead
of M) at position 105 with 100% homology to the
obpNLS region, suggesting the authenticity of the identified amino acid change as a natural variant.

Methods
Cells, virus and reagents
MDCK (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and COS-7L cells (Invitrogen, Gaithersberg, MD) were grown at 37°C with 5% CO2
in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen, Gaithersberg, MD). Influenza A virus
WS/33 strain was a gift from Dr. Zhiping Ye, CBER, FDA
and is referred to in the present study as WS/33L to distinguish it from the published WS/33 strains. Mouse monoclonal anti-GFP antibody was purchased from Clontech
labs (Pasadena, CA).
RT-PCR
MDCK cells were infected with WS/33L as per a previous
protocol and incubated for 48 hours [19]. Total cellular
RNA from virus-infected MDCK cells was extracted with
RNA STAT-60 as previously described [20]. The RNA (5
µl) was subjected to reverse-transcriptase-based polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using a pair of forward (5'-cgc
gaattcatggcgaccaaaggc) and reverse (3'-gacccc gggcccattgtcgtactcctc) primers specific to 5' and 3' orf termini of
influenza A nucleoprotein gene [WS/33 strain, GenBank:AAA43452]. PCR products originating from virusinfected cellular RNA were cloned into a TA cloning plasmid, pCR3.1 and referred to as pCR-NP-L. (Invitrogen,
Gaithersberg, MD). The PCR products as well as the pCRNP-L clones were sequenced using internal NP-specific,
T7, and BGH primers as provided by the manufacturer
(Invitrogen, Gaithersberg, MD).
Construction of NP-GFP fusion plasmids
Primers were designed based on the Genbank WS/33 NP
sequence [GenBank:AAA43452] to generate the fulllength and various deletion constructs between aa position 41 and 197 of the NP protein. PCR-NP-L was used as
template for PCR reactions and all the originating products were cloned into pEGFP-C2 vector (Clontech, CA) in
fusion with the C-terminus of GFP using appropriate
restriction enzymes (Table 1). NP? obpNLS clone was

constructed by inserting the EcoRI-ApaI digested fragment
of NP122–197 into NP41–89 clone. To derive the obpNLSNSP6 clone, obpNLS was cloned at the XhoI-EcoRI sites of
GFP-NSP6 clone such that the N-terminus of obpNLS was
in fusion with GFP, whereas the C-terminus of the protein
was in fusion with NSP6 protein from lamb rotavirus
[21]. All clones were sequenced prior to immunoblot or
localization analysis.
Transfection and confocal microscopic analysis
Transient transfections were performed on COS-7L cells,
maintained either in 6-well culture plates or in 8-well
chamber slides as described previously [22]. Cells were
transfected with 2–5 µg of plasmid DNA with lipofectamine plus® reagent as per the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen, USA). Following 24 hours after
transfection, cells were fixed in ice-cold acetone and
mounted with Vectashield containing propidium iodide
(Vector labs, CA). Visualization, analysis and photography were all performed using a Carl Zeiss laser-scanning
confocal microscope (Model: LSM5 PASCAL) equipped
with a microprocessor. Images were transferred to PC version of Adobe Photoshope 5.0 for labeling and printing.

Cytolysate preparation and Immunoblot assay
COS-7L cells, cultured in 6–well plates and transfected
with various NP-GFP constructs, were washed with 1×
PBS, centrifuged at 2.5 K in a refrigerated centrifuge (Sorvall, USA) and extracted with RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl,
pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1.0% NP-40, 0.5%
sodium deoxycholate). Total proteins were resolved on 4–
20% SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen, CA), transferred to PVDF
membrane (Millipore, USA) and the membrane incubated overnight with 1: 1,000 diluted mouse monoclonal
anti-GFP antibody at 4°C [23]. Secondary incubation
with 1:10,000 diluted anti-mouse peroxidase-conjugated
antibody (Chemicon, USA) was carried out at room temperature for 90 min. and signals were detected by ECLchemiluminescence detection (Pierce, CA).

Results and Discussion
i. Comparative analysis of the deduced amino acid NP
sequence from WS/33L
The full-length orf of the NP was amplified, cloned,
sequenced and the sequence submitted to the genomic
database [GenBank: EU330203]. The deduced aa coding
sequence of NP-L was compared to five other WS/33 NP
sequences available in the database (one of those being
only a partial coding sequence between aa 14–193) (Fig.
1). Results from our comparative analyses revealed that

the published WS/33 NP sequences fall into two distinct
types,
type
WS-A
[consisting
of
sequences
EMBL:Q1K9H2, EMBL:AAG41965 and EMBL:ABF21292]
and type WS-B [includes sequence GenBank:AAA43452
and GenBank:P15682] (Fig 1). Between type A and B
there is a 98.99% homology at the aa level and differ only
by 5 amino acids at residues 34, 105, 237, 283 and 472.
NP sequence from the influenza virus strain that caused
pandemic flu in 1918 was included here for comparison.
Our NP-L sequence appears more like a type A sequence
as it shares homology to type A at 4 of the above 5 critical
residue positions. However, NP-L sequence shared
homology to type B sequences at residue 283, indicating
that it does not share a 100% homology to either type A
or type B (Fig. 1).

IRR) we did not utilize this sequence in our localization
experiments for the sake of ease of understanding (Fig. 2).
Both bpNLS-1 and bpNLS-2 signals adhere strictly to the
classical bpNLS signature pattern that consists of 17 aa,
with two basic rich regions separated by a spacer region of
any 10 aa, and of the two basic regions, one end containing at least two basic aa (K or R) whereas the other flanking end containing at least 3 basic aa out of a total of 5
residues [16-18]. Interestingly, the previously reported
classical NLS (cNLS) (between aa 198–216) did not qualify as a classical bpNLS by the PSORT analyses as it had
more than 10 aa in the spacer region [15-17]. The above
finding is in concurrence with results from a recent study
wherein the mechanism by which influenza A virus NP
oligomerizes and subsequently binds to RNA were evaluated by structural analysis [5]. In this study, structural
analysis of NP was performed in great detail and based on
the accessibility of the NLS in relation to the structure, it
was suggested that the cNLS may not function as a classical NLS at all [5].

ii. Bioinformatic analyses of NP-L reveal a novel
overlapping bipartite NLS (obpNLS)
The putative amino acid sequence of NP was analyzed by
a web-based PSORT program served at the Institute for
Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Japan (see Availability and requirements section for URL). The analyses
indicated that a single aa change (M105R) resulted in converting the flanking regions (between aa 90–121) into
two overlapping bipartite nuclear localizing signals
(obpNLS). The obpNLS constituted of bpNLS-1
and
bpNLS-2
(90KKTGGPIYRRVDGKWRR106)
(105RRELILYDKEEIRRIWR121) (Fig. 2). It is to be noted
that though a second combination, predictive for bpNLS2, existed between aa 103 and 118 (KWRRELILYDKEE-

iii. NP-L full-length and deletion GFP constructs and
analysis of their expression
In order to gain a clear understanding of the contribution
of the obpNLS in the nuclear localization function of the
NP, we designed constructs that excluded nNLS and cNLS
regions and contained only the obpNLS and its flanking
regions between aa 41–197 (Fig. 3). All NP-GFP plasmid
constructs were transfected in to COS-7L cells to analyze
the correct (in-frame) expression of the fusion protein.

Initially, expression analysis was performed by visually
observing for GFP fluorescence under a Nikon Eclipse
2000 fluorescent microscope. Following this, expression
of all constructs was confirmed more specifically by analyzing the transfected lysates in an immunoblot assay
using a monoclonal GFP antibody. Fig. 4 demonstrates
that all the NP-GFP transfected lysates contain fusion proteins within the expected range of size.
iv. Protein localization analysis by Confocal microscopy
a. obpNLS-containing NP-L constructs localize exclusively to the
nucleus
Cellular localization of the GFP-fused NP constructs was
performed on COS-7L cells and subcellular localization
was assessed as described earlier [7]. Localization was classified into N (nuclear), N>C (nuclear greater than cytoplasmic), C>N (cytoplasmic greater than nuclear), and C
(cytoplasmic). Transfection of NP-FL demonstrated a typical punctuate or dotted nuclear localization pattern as
described in the literature (Fig. 5) [3,6]. The other 3 deletion constructs, obpNLS+NC, obpNLS+N-ter, and
obpNLS+C-ter, that contained the obpNLS and devoid of
both nNLS and cNLS were all localized exclusively and/or
predominantly to the nucleus (Fig. 5). Though there was
some cytoplasmic localization observed in < 10% of cells
transfected with obpNLS+NC, it was also noted that all
these cells had nuclear fluorescence greater than the cytoplasmic, suggesting a typical N>C localization pattern
(Fig. 5).

b. bpNLS-1 and bpNLS-2 containing the wild-type Arg at aa 105
(R105) translocate to nucleus
Since the obpNLS contained signals for two bpNLSs that
were overlapping, we tested both the signals individually
by separating them into bpNLS-1R and bpNLS-2R, such
that the 105RR106 of obpNLS was common to both these
signals (Fig. 3). Transfection with these plasmid constructs resulted in the bpNLS-1R exhibiting a typical exclusive nuclear localization pattern (N), whereas the bpNLS2R, though displaying a strong nuclear localization pattern however did also result in (though to a lesser extent)
cytoplasmic localization as well (Fig. 6).

Once it was established that both bp-NLS-1R and bpNLS2R (containing the wild-type Arg at position 105) were
functional signals and were able to translocate efficiently
to nucleus we attempted to evaluate the significance of
Arg105 in the nuclear localizing potential of both these signals. This was achieved by designing two plasmid constructs, with the Arg (R105) substituted with Met (M105),
and were named bpNLS-1M and bpNLS-2M (Fig. 3). The
bpNLS-1M-transfected cells demonstrated a C>N localization pattern and occasionally demonstrated an exclusive
cytoplasmic localization in some cells (Fig. 6). Though
the nuclear localization of bpNLS-1M was relatively less
predominant than the cytoplasmic localization, this result
was unexpected. This could be attributed to the fact that
some proteins translocate efficiently to the nucleus even
in absence of a functional NLS when the total basic residues content of the protein is greater than 20% [16,17].
This led us to analyze whether the basic residues within
the bpNLS-1M aa sequence were contributing towards the
nuclear localization. To our surprise, analyses of the
bpNLS-1M aa sequence (constituting NP41–106) revealed
that the total basic residue content within this region was
exactly 20% and this as well might be the contributing factor in the nuclear localizing potential of bpNLS-1M. Similar findings have been reported previously wherein NP
constructs containing aa 1–80 (a region rich in basic-residue content) localized exclusively to nucleus [7]. Analysis
of the bpNLS-2M expression on the other hand revealed
results as predicted and exhibited an exclusive cytoplasmic localization (Fig. 6).
c. NP-L constructs lacking the obpNLS localize predominantly to the
cytoplasm
To further emphasize the significance of obpNLS in the
nuclear localizing potential of NP a series of deletion constructs were made such that 3 different constructs, lacking
all three NLSs (nNLS, cNLS and obpNLS), were achieved
(Fig. 3). These 3 plasmids, NP41–89, NP122–197 (data not
shown) and NP? obpNLS, when transfected in to COS-7L
cells revealed a cytoplasmic localization pattern as
expected (Fig. 7). Interestingly, the NP122–197 exhibited a
cytoplasmic localization pattern (data not shown) similar

Confocal immunofluorescence analysis of various NP constructs containing the obpNLS. COS-7L cells transfected
with the various NP-GFP constructs were fixed and mounted with propidium iodide-containing medium to indicate nuclear
staining. NP-L exhibits a typical punctuate, nuclear localization pattern. obpNLS+NC, obpNLS+N-ter and obpNLS+C-ter all
localize to the nucleus.

Expression analysis of construct lacking obpNLS and construct with obpNLS in fusion with a known cytoplasmic protein. NP? obpNLS, transfected in COS-7L cells, exhibits a characteristic cytoplasmic localization pattern. C2-GFP,
used as a vector control, localizes to the cytoplasm. Rotavirus non structural protein 6 (NSP6) fused with GFP (GFP-NSP6)
exhibits a typical punctate, cytoplasmic localization pattern. However, note that the obpNLS+NSP6 (obpNLS fused to the Nterminus of NSP6) exhibit an exclusive nuclear localization pattern. Bar represents 20 μm.

to the bpNLS-2M (Fig. 6) with intensive accumulation in
the cytoplasm as aggregates which appears more akin to
golgi-like localization pattern.
d. obpNLS signal alone efficiently translocates a known cytoplasmic,
non-influenza viral protein to the nucleus
In all the above experiments it was proven beyond doubt
that the obpNLS was indeed a functional NLS with both
the overlapping bpNLSs contributing equally to translocate the NP to nucleus. In order to ascertain that the
obpNLS is a potent and functional NLS we tested the signal by fusing it to a known cytoplasmic protein, rotavirus
NSP6 (Fig. 3) [21]. The rotavirus is a known cytoplasmic
virus with exclusive cytoplasmic localization of all viral
proteins. More specifically, the NSP6 exhibits a typical
cytoplasmic, punctate localization pattern both in
infected and transfected cells (Fig. 7) [21]. However, once
the obpNLS was fused to NSP6, this known cytoplasmic
protein localized exclusively to nucleus and demonstrated
a typical nuclear localization pattern similar to that of the
NP (Fig. 7).

Thus, the present study reports the presence of a novel
third obpNLS in the influenza virus NP-L and unambiguously demonstrates that this signal is functional. It is noteworthy that the obpNLS of NP-L is present in 9 other
influenza virus strains (out of a total of 500 NP sequences
screened) suggesting that the Met to Arg change (M105R)
does occur naturally and that this single aa change results
in the conversion of the region between aa 90 to 121 to a
32-residue obpNLS (Table 2). It would be interesting to
analyze whether the presence of the third NLS in NP in
these strains impart any specific advantage to the virus or
if there exists any difference in the nuclear staining pattern
between strains with 2 and 3 NLSs in the NP. None of
these 9 strains, containing obpNLS (Table 2), have been
utilized in the previously published NP nuclear localization studies. However, it is to be noted that NP from typeB WSN33 strains (that contain only the nNLS and cNLS)
were utilized extensively for cellular localization analysis
and it was observed that the NP nuclear localization pat-

tern was very similar in virus-infected as well as NP-transfected cells [3,6,8,14]. What is more pertinent is that the
nuclear staining pattern observed with the NP-FL (containing 3 NLSs) in the present study is very similar to that
observed with NP-FL (with 2 NLSs) in the previous studies
[3,6,8,14]. Though this is an indirect evidence, it still provides a preliminary comparison of the staining pattern
between these two types of NPs. Furthermore, of the 9
strains that exhibit the presence of an obpNLS, 6 are reassortant swine virus strains and the other 3 are WS/33
strains. Interestingly, two out of the 3 WS/33 strains, that
contain the obpNLS exhibited distinct pathogenic features. One was a persistent, neurovirulent strain, while the
second one was a temperature-sensitive variant (ts61).
The precise role of obpNLS towards persistence or temperature-sensitivity of these strains is not known and needs to
be investigated further [24].

Conclusion
We report here a novel NLS in the NP of influenza A virus
by bioinformatic analysis and present evidence that this
signal is transport efficient. Future studies on the relevance of this signal towards viral replication or pathogenesis, especially by using a reverse-genetics system available
for influenza virus, could provide valuable clues in viral
biology. This report while not only establishes a new NLS
in the influenza virus A strain, it also reinforces the idea
that proper application of bioinformatics-coupled experimental analysis serves as a powerful tool in identifying
new functional signals in proteins of interest [25].
