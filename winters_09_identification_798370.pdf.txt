Abstract
Background: Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity in plants is a trait with potential economic,
agricultural and environmental impact. In relation to the food industry, PPO-induced browning
causes unacceptable discolouration in fruit and vegetables: from an agriculture perspective, PPO
can protect plants against pathogens and environmental stress, improve ruminant growth by
increasing nitrogen absorption and decreasing nitrogen loss to the environment through the
animal's urine. The high PPO legume, red clover, has a significant economic and environmental role
in sustaining low-input organic and conventional farms. Molecular markers for a range of important
agricultural traits are being developed for red clover and improved knowledge of PPO genes and
their structure will facilitate molecular breeding.
Results: A bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library comprising 26,016 BAC clones with an
average 135 Kb insert size, was constructed from Trifolium pratense L. (red clover), a diploid legume
with a haploid genome size of 440–637 Mb. Library coverage of 6–8 genome equivalents ensured
good representation of genes: the library was screened for polyphenol oxidase (PPO) genes.
Two single copy PPO genes, PPO4 and PPO5, were identified to add to a family of three, previously
reported, paralogous genes (PPO1–PPO3). Multiple PPO1 copies were identified and characterised
revealing a subfamily comprising three variants PPO1/2, PPO1/4 and PPO1/5. Six PPO genes
clustered within the genome: four separate BAC clones could be assembled onto a predicted 190–
510 Kb single BAC contig.
Conclusion: A PPO gene family in red clover resides as a cluster of at least 6 genes. Three of these
genes have high homology, suggesting a more recent evolutionary event. This PPO cluster covers
a longer region of the genome than clusters detected in rice or previously reported in tomato. Fulllength coding sequences from PPO4, PPO5, PPO1/5 and PPO1/4 will facilitate functional studies
and provide genetic markers for plant breeding.

Background
Polyphenol oxidases (PPOs) are implicated in a range of
biological functions in diverse systems. In addition to a
role in black/brown pigment biosynthesis, PPOs may also
have protective roles in plants against pathogens and environmental stress. While PPO-induced browning is a
major problem in the food industry, causing massive
losses through unacceptable discolouration in fruit and
vegetables [1,2], it is also implicated in plant defence
against bacterial and fungal diseases of diverse plant species [3-7]. Down-regulating constitutive and induced
expression of PPOs in tomato by antisense methods
resulted in increased pathogen susceptibility [7]. In the
forage legume Trifolium pratense L. (red clover), PPO activity also provides some protection against natural infestations of sciarid fly, thrips and aphids under semicontrolled conditions [8].
PPO activity in red clover is an agriculturally and environmentally important trait. Red clover provides a significant
and sustainable component of grazed pastures in lowinput organic and conventional farms and is harvested for
conservation as hay or silage in Europe and North America [9]. Major nutritional benefits of PPO activity have
been recognised in this crop; high levels of PPO activity
confer protection against protein degradation by microorganisms in the animal rumen [10,11] and by plant
enzymes during ensilage [12,13]. Lower protein degradation in the rumen and during ensiling results in increased
nitrogen absorption by ruminants and simultaneously
decreases nitrogen loss to the environment through the
animal's urine.
PPO enzymes are ubiquitous and found in a broad range
of dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous species. In legumes only a latent form of PPO enzyme was reported in
leaves of the grain legume, Vicia faba [14], but active PPO
enzymes are constitutively expressed in both aerial and
root tissues in T. pratense. Thus, T. pratense offers an ideal
opportunity to study a PPO gene family and aspects of
PPO function. Complete coding sequences, but not promoter regions, of PPO genes PPO1, PPO2 and PPO3, have
previously been reported [15]. Expression patterns of the
three known PPO genes vary in red clover: PPO1 is most
abundant in young leaves, PPO2 in flowers and petioles,
and PPO3 in leaves and also possibly in flowers [15]. In
tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.), expression profiles
of a six-member PPO gene family (PPOs A/A', B, C, D, E
and F) revealed differential PPO expression [7,16]. PPO B
is highly expressed in young tomato leaves, whereas transcripts of PPO B, E and F dominate in the inflorescence.
Specific PPO transcripts are also associated with different
trichome types.
The tomato PPO gene family has six paralogous genes,
which all appear to be clustered on a 165 Kb region on

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/94

chromosome 8 [17]. The genomic relationship between
members of the T. pratense PPO gene family is unknown,
but similarities in gene structure and function, combined
with differences in individual PPO gene expression profiles in red clover [15], suggest that these red clover PPO
genes are also paralogues. Such gene duplication, followed by divergence from the parent sequence by mutation and selection or drift, is believed to provide a
platform for evolutionary change within genomes [18].
The haploid genome size of T. pratense has previously
been estimated as 637 Mb when measured by microdensitometry of Feulgen-stained nuclei [19] and, more
recently, as 440 Mb when measured by flow cytometry
[20]. Two red clover libraries already exist [20] but they
have relatively small insert sizes. Here, we describe the creation of a new T. pratense BAC library with a larger insert
size and its use in isolating additional PPO genes and their
regulatory regions and in determining the relationship
between PPO gene family members within the T. pratense
genome.

Results
BAC library construction and validation
The T. pratense BAC library was constructed from partially
digested gDNA in a single, high molecular weight, size
selection experiment. A total of 26,016 BACs were picked
into 271 96-well plates, with an estimated average insert
size of 135 Kb per BAC clone, based on 58 randomly
selected BAC clones (Figure 1, 2).
PCR-based screen of BAC library and PPO sequence
analysis
The primer pairs specific to PPO2, PPO4 and PPO5 identified 5–6 BACs each, indicating one copy of each gene. By
contrast, the PPO1 primer pair identified at least 28 BAC
clones (Table 1). All PPO genes were sequenced directly
from selected BAC clones. An iterative process of sequencing and primer design revealed a subfamily of PPO1.

Three variants PPO1/2, PPO1/4 and PPO1/5 could be
clearly distinguished based on their coding regions (Figure 3) and were further distinguished by differences in
their flanking sequences. Primer pairs specific to variants
PPO1/2 and PPO1/5 initially identified four and nine
BAC clones, respectively (Table 1). In contrast, at least 26
BAC clones with PPO1/4 were identified from the PCRbased screen of the BAC library (Table 1).
Sequencing confirmed the presence of PPO1/2 on two
BAC clones and PPO1/5 on four BAC clones. Five of the
26 BAC clones harbouring PPO1/4 were analysed further.
Three of the five BACs also harboured other PPO genes,
while the remaining two contained PPO1/4 alone; BACend sequencing showed homology regions with fully

sequences, differing only in six separate, single bases.
PPO1/5 has the highest homology (99%) with the previously reported PPO1 [15].
Sequence analysis of PPO4 and PPO5
Full length coding DNA sequences of PPO4 [GenBank:
EF183483.1] and PPO5 [GenBank: EF183484.1] were
deduced from BAC sequences; neither gene contained
introns. PPO4 and PPO5 sequences encode predicted proteins comprising 604 and 605 amino acids with molecular weights of 68.4 and 68.6 kDa, respectively. Identity
between PPO1, PPO2, PPO3, PPO4 and PPO5 genes at
the cDNA and amino acid sequence levels are 84–94%
and 70–88%, respectively, with PPO3 and PPO5 showing
highest homology (Figure 4). Flanking DNA sequences
show little homology, indicating that the PPO genes are in
different positions on the genome and therefore verify
their separate identities (Table 1).

sequenced BAC 212 G7, indicating that the solitary PPO1/
4 gene resided within this larger BAC clone.
Further sequence analysis of PPO1/5 revealed that one of
the four BAC clones contained a 100 bp deletion in 1.7 Kb
of 3' non-coding flanking region; otherwise there was
>99.5% identity in both PPO coding and flanking

PPO gene clusters
Some BAC clones contained more than one PPO gene and
this information was used to create a map of a predicted
PPO cluster (Figure 5). For example, out of five separate
BAC clones containing PPO1, one contained PPO1/5
alone (BAC 52 A5), a second contained PPO2, PPO1/2
and PPO1/5 (BAC 98 A1), a third contained PPO1/2,
PPO1/5 and PPO5 (BAC 32 D7), a fourth contained
PPO1/4, PPO1/5 and PPO5 (BAC 212 G7), and a fifth
contained PPO1/4 and PPO4 (BAC 205 F12). Analysis of
four of these BAC clones containing 11 identified PPO
genes provided evidence of a potential cluster of six distinct PPO genes within 190–510 Kb (Figure 5). The full
sequence of BAC 212 G7 confirmed the presence of three
PPO genes (PPO1/5, PPO5 and PPO1/4) and no other
plant genes; however, retrotransposons were detected. The
minimum PPO cluster length is based on 156,267 bp of
sequence from BAC clone 212 G7 plus sequence from
PPO2, PPO1/2 and PPO4 genes and their flanking regions
and a calculation of sequence overlap between BAC
clones 205 F12 and 32 D7 with 212 G7.

Alignment of sequenced BAC 212 G7 and BAC 52 A5,
containing the single copy of PPO1/5, revealed about 1.5
Kb identical flanking sequences; in addition, M13 (-20)
derived BAC-end sequence of BAC 52 A5 was contained
within BAC 212 G7, indicating that this PPO gene also lies
within the proposed gene cluster.

of BAC DNA following fractionation by pulse-field gel electrophoresis. The average insert size of the library was estimated at 135 Kb.

PPO3 has not been identified in this red clover BAC
library. However, both PPO3 and PPO5 have been
detected by sequencing PCR products of individual plants
from cultivars Sabtoron, Britta and Milvus, including the
genotype used to generate the BAC library, using diagnostic primers. Coding regions of PPO3 and PPO5 differ
(88% amino acids and 94% DNA; Figure 4), but show
98% homology over 171 bp of 3' flanking region.

PCR products from gDNA superpools of BAC library were sequenced and confirmed as PPO1/4.

A search of the GenBank database revealed that rice has
two PPO genes in tandem on a 29,943 bp sequence [GenBank: AP008210] (Figure 6), with at least one of these rice
PPO
genes
being
expressed
[GenBank:
NM_001060467.1]. In Medicago truncatula [GenBank:
AC157507.2] there are two PPOs, which differ by 11%, on
an 8 Kb genomic sequence, but no equivalent ESTs have
yet been deposited in the databases.
Relationship of DNA sequences of PPO
A phylogenetic analysis of DNA coding sequences confirmed sequence similarities within species, and showed
differences between PPO sequences from Solanaceous
and leguminous species (Figure 7; p < 0.01). Bootstrapping exercises were applied to the datasets to measure how
consistently the data support given taxon bipartitions. All
the tree branches support values generated in this study
have high support values (>50%) and therefore provide
uniform support.

Sequences from different PPO genes of the Solanaceous
species, Solanum tuberosum and Lycopersicon esculentum
(Solanum lycopersicon), showed a high level of similarity
between, as well as within, species (Figure 7). Within the
legumes, PPO sequence from Medicago sativa was more
similar to the two M. truncatula and Vicia faba sequences
than to the seven T. pratense sequences. In T. pratense
PPO1/2, PPO1/4 and PPO1/5 exhibited the highest similarity, followed by PPO3 and PPO5 (Figure 7).

Discussion
Characteristics of BAC library
The genome size of T. pratense was previously estimated as
440 Mb [20] and 637 Mb [19]. The average BAC insert size
was estimated as 135 Kb therefore, the predicted genome
coverage of the library was 6–8 ×. This library comple-

ments two existing red clover libraries with smaller average insert sizes at 80 and 108 Kb [20]. A library with a
larger insert size offers an advantage in reducing the
number of clones required for adequate coverage of the
genome. This will also simplify screening the generation
of BAC contigs as demonstrated in this study and physical
mapping.
PPO copy number
Numbers of BAC clones in the library containing PPO1,
PPO2, PPO4 and PPO5 varied from four to ≥ 28 (Table 1).
Between five and six copies of PPO2, PPO4 and PPO5
were detected in the library, suggesting that these genes
are present as single copies in the red clover genome. Both
PPO3 and PPO5 were detected in genotypes of three red
clover cultivars, suggesting separate genes. The high
homology of their 3' flanking sequences may indicate a
duplication event. However, PPO3 was not identified in
the BAC library. This may have resulted from an uneven
distribution of restriction enzyme recognition sites
throughout the genome [21]. Regions with low numbers
of restriction sites may be under-represented, while
regions with higher number of restriction sites may create
fragments smaller than the cut off fragment size, which in
our case was <90 Kb.

By contrast, a minimum of 28 potential BAC clones containing PPO1 were identified in the library, indicating
multiple copies. Sequencing indicated three PPO1 variants: PPO1/2, PPO1/4 and PPO1/5, (Figure 3). PPO1/2
was detected in four BAC clones indicating a single copy
in the genome, whilst PPO1/4 was detected in at least 26
BAC clones suggesting either multiple copies or an overrepresentation of this gene in the BAC library. The latter is
most likely since BAC ends of both BAC clones that contain PPO 1/4 alone map onto BAC 212 G7, indicating that

Four PPO1/5 genes were sequenced; while three were
identical, the fourth had near identical homology in both

PPO family of genes and genome structure
The results presented in this manuscript indicate that
there are five distinct paralogous genes in the red clover
multigene PPO family: PPO1–PPO5. The BAC library has
yielded full length gene sequences and upstream regulatory regions for two new PPO genes, PPO4 and PPO5, and
for two variants of PPO1, PPO1/5 and PPO1/4. There
were no introns identified in the newly identified red cloPage 5 of 11

ver PPO genes and variants. This was in agreement with
results reported previously for PPO in other dicotyledonous species, including hybrid poplar [22], potato [23],
tomato [17] and red clover [15], and as predicted from M.
truncatula genomic sequences [GenBank: AC157507.2],
but is in contrast to PPO genes identified in monocotyledonous species, such as pineapple [24], wheat [GenBank:

AP008210], Lolium perenne [GenBank: FJ587212] and Festuca pratense [GenBank: FJ587213].
The occurrence of multiple PPOs on single BAC clones
and the putative alignment of four BAC clones with six
distinct PPO genes on an estimated 190–510 Kb fragment
is strong evidence for a PPO gene cluster in T. pratense
(Figure 5). The order and presence of three PPO genes
were confirmed by sequencing a 156,267 bp BAC clone,
212 G7. Similar PPO clusters were previously reported in
tomato [16] where seven genes were reported as clustered

there are two PPO genes present in 8 Kb of sequence [GenBank: AC157507.2] and in rice, where two active PPO
genes and a redundant PPO pseudogene (Figure 6; [GenBank: AP008210.1]) are present in 30 Kb of sequence; rice
PPO2 also contains a 11.3 Kb retrotransposon-like insert
exhibiting 94% homology with a gypsy-type retrotransposon in rice [GenBank: AB030283] [26]. Retrotransposon
insertion into the maize waxy gene does not appear to
have impaired protein coding ability [27].
No other genes were identified in the vicinity of the red
clover PPO cluster, although retrotransposons and
regions of homology with M. truncatula and Lotus japonicus genomic sequence were found on the sequenced BAC
212 G7. Retrotransposons are implicated in gene duplication, altering patterns of gene expression and generating
new functions in legumes and maize [27-29].
Clustering of duplicated genes is a well-established phenomenon in plants. This could influence gene function
and facilitate co-ordinated expression, and, in duplicated
genes, such as PPO genes, minor changes in position may
allow subtle changes in regulation, which may benefit the
plant under new selection regimes by creating novel tissue-specific or environmentally induced expression.

Evolutionary implications
Gene clustering and the occurrence of paralogous
sequences in the PPO gene family can hint at underlying
gene evolution and function mechanisms. For example,
paralogous genes are widely recognised and expected to
have diverged by a minimum of 10% over time [30]. Four
of the five PPO genes have diverged by 10% or more at the
cDNA or amino acid levels (Figure 4), whereas PPO3 [15]
and the newly sequenced PPO5 share 94% identity. This
is substantially higher than the 80–90% identity expected
for ancient paralogues. Nearly identical paralogues (NIPs)
have been defined as paralogous genes that exhibit ≥ 98%
identity [30]. Such NIPS are claimed to allow differential
expression within the gene family and increase plasticity

The divergence of PPO genes within red clover is similar
to that observed within other plant species. For example,
the two PPO genes identified in M. truncatula have 90%
identity [GenBank: AC157507.2] whereas the seven clustered genes [GenBank: Z12833, Z12834, Z12835,
Z12836, Z12837, Z12838] in the tomato PPO family have
between 73 and 97% identity [17].

of the transcriptome [30]. In red clover, variants of PPO1
may be considered as NIPs: PPO1/2, PPO1/5 and PPO1/
4 exhibit more than 98% identity.
The different PPOs, including the three NIPs of PPO1,
have presumably arisen due to partial genome duplication, the extent of divergence relating to the timing of the
duplication event(s). PPO gene sequences vary considerably, forming clear phylogenetic groups for higher plants,
vertebrates, fungi and bacteria [31]. DNA sequences show
high homology within species and within families, such
as Solanaceae (Solanum, Lycopersicon and Nicotiana species) and Fabaceae (Vicia, Trifolium and Medicago species)
(Figure 7).

Red clover possesses a large, functional PPO gene family
(Figure 7). While PPO enzymes are expressed constitutively in aerial and root tissues of T. pratense, PPO
enzymes only exist in a latent or inactive form in leaf tissue of both T. repens (unpublished data) and V. faba [14].
By contrast, PPO activity is not detected in other agronomically important forage legumes, such as Medicago
sativa (alfalfa) and Lotus corniculatus (birdsfoot trefoil), or
in the model species M. truncatula and L. japonicus
(unpublished data). At least one PPO gene is present in M.
sativa, and two in M. truncatula yet, to date, no ESTs have
been reported for either species. It is possible that conditions have not yet been determined that elicit PPO gene
expression in these species, but the apparent lack of PPO
transcript concurs with failure to detect PPO enzyme
activity in tissues of either species.
These observations raise questions about the evolution of
PPO genes both within T. pratense and between T. pratense
and its close relatives. Phylogenetic trees of divergence of
T. pratense PPO DNA sequences (Figure 7) confirm the
level of identity of red clover PPO at the genetic level, with
PPO1 NIPs being most similar and probably, therefore,
most recently diverged [22,32].
Diversification of plant genomes is powered in part by
gene duplication, which can result in new gene functions
[33]. Such gene duplication may occur by creation of
polyploids, by segmental duplication or duplication in
tandem arrays resulting in the production of gene clusters.
Positive selection is believed to play a crucial role in the
retention of such duplicated genes [33] but the effect of
positive selection on tandem arrays or clusters of genes is
not clear [18]. Over time, individual PPO genes and PPO
clusters may have originated, duplicated and subsequently been lost, their function governed by mutations
in regulatory elements. A comparison of selected PPO
DNA sequences in both red clover and tomato (Figure 7),
indicates that such gene duplication has occurred leading
to clusters of six or seven similar PPO genes, each with
known, different expression patterns.
PPO localisation and function
The biological effects of PPO appear to be subtle, possibly
requiring specific or even multiple triggers for expression
in vivo. Enhanced localised PPO expression under biotic
and abiotic stress provides evidence of its involvement in

BMC Plant Biology 2009, 9:94

plant protection in various species, for example, localised
PPO expression in leaf abscission zones during drought
[34]. A multiple regulatory trigger might explain the prerequisite of plant hardening, by low temperature and low
light mimicking autumn conditions, before any difference
in susceptibility to Sclerotinia trifoliorum was detected
between late and medium-late flowering types of red clover [35]. Similarly, differences in survival of low PPOmutant and wild-type red clover plants only became
apparent under multiple, natural infestations [8].
The high degree of homology in active sites of red clover
PPO indicates similar enzymic properties. However, differences do occur in localisation of PPO enzyme activity
and specific PPO gene expression in both red clover [15]
and tomato [7,16,17], suggesting significant differences in
their regulatory elements; this is supported by observed
differences in sequenced promoter regions of four red clover PPO genes. Red clover PPO genes are differentially
expressed in aerial tissues and root tissues [15] conferring
the potential for enhanced or localised expression following differing abiotic and biotic stimuli.

Conclusion
The red clover BAC library has yielded novel full-length
gene sequences of PPO4, PPO5 and the PPO1 NIP PPO1/
4, which will be used in functional studies involving techniques such as RNAi, and the PPO promoter sequences
will be used for localisation studies using promoter::reporter gene fusions. It has also revealed recent
gene duplication events in the form of NIPs and evidence
of gene clustering. The BAC library will provide a useful
tool for the map-based cloning of target QTL, physical
mapping, genome structure analyses and the alignment of
specific regions of the T. pratense genome with its close relatives the model legume, M. truncatula, and other legume
species such as alfalfa, revealing any genomic changes or
divergence at these sites. The high degree of synteny
between T. pratense and T. repens with both M. truncatula
and M. sativa [20,36] will allow comparative mapping
between model and agronomically important legumes.

Methods
Construction of the red clover BAC library was based on
procedures described previously [37].
Isolation of high molecular weight genomic DNA
High molecular weight (HMW) DNA was isolated from a
single genotype of diploid T. pratense cultivar Milvus (2n
= 2x = 14). The plants were maintained in darkness for 42
h prior to harvesting a total of 21.9 g leaf tissue. The leaf
tissue was frozen and stored at -80°C. Leaf tissue was
ground in liquid nitrogen and nuclei isolated [38]. The
nuclei were embedded in agarose plugs and, before digestion, the HMW DNA was subjected to a pre-electrophore-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/94

sis step on a 1% (w/v) agarose (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA)
gel using a CHEF-DR II PFGE apparatus (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) [39,40].
Partial digestion and size selection of digested DNA
The entire library was generated from a single size selection experiment. T. pratense DNA was partially digested
using HindIII (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and separated in a single step, on a 1% (w/v) pulse field certified
agarose gel, by PFGE at 5.2 V cm-1 for 16 h with a linear
pulse ramp from 0.5–40 s using a CHEF-DR II apparatus
(BioRad). Partial digestion was performed using a low
enzyme concentration (0.5 U/plug) at 37°C for 1 h,
which in preliminary studies resulted in a smear of DNA
between 160 Kb and 90 Kb but no significant DNA below
this on the gel.

Following electrophoresis, the flanking regions of the gel
containing HMW DNA ladder (lambda ladder PFG
marker; NEB, Beverly, MA) were stained with ethidium
bromide and marked under UV so that alignment with the
unstained gel allowed the selection of one gel slice in the
range of 100–150 Kb. This gel slice was then excised and
the partially digested genomic DNA recovered by dialysis
[39].
Ligation and transformation
The partially digested DNA was ligated with HindIIIdigested pIndigoBAC-5 vector (Epicentre Biotechnologies, Madison, WI, USA) using a predicted vector/insert
molar ratio of between 5:1 and 10:1. Ligations were carried out in 1× T4 DNA ligase buffer at 14°C overnight
using 1 Weiss unit of T4 DNA ligase (Roche) per 50 μl of
ligation buffer. The ligation reaction was drop dialysed
and 1 μl of the ligation product was transformed into 20
μl of Escherichia coli ElectroMAX DH10B competent cells
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) by electroporation
(GenePulser II; Bio-Rad). Transformed cells were allowed
to recover in 1 ml SOC media (2% w/v bacto tryptone,
0.5% w/v bacto yeast extract, 10 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl,
10 mM MgCl2, 20 mM glucose, pH 7.0) at 37°C for 45
min with shaking at 180 rpm, and plated out on LB plates
containing 12.5 μg ml-1 of chloramphenicol and incubated at 37°C overnight [37,41].
Picking and storing
BAC colonies were picked in duplicate into 200 μl of
Freezing Broth (LB, 36 mM K2HPO4, 13.2 mM KH2PO4,
1.7 mM Na Citrate, 0.4 mM MgSO4, 6.8 mM (NH4)2SO4,
4.4% v/v Glycerol, 12.5 μg ml-1 chloramphenicol) in 96well microtitre plates using a GloPix robot (Genetix, New
Milton, Hampshire, UK). Following overnight incubation
at 37°C, plates were stored at -80°C. A total of 26,016
BAC clones were picked into 271 96-well plates.

Determination of insert size of BAC clones
A total of 58 BAC clones chosen at random were selected,
cultured overnight and insert size determined. Following
NotI restriction digestion, isolated DNA was separated by
PFGE in the presence of molecular weight markers in
order to estimate the average insert size of the cloned
DNA.
Pooling of BAC library for PCR-based screening
The library was replicated in microtitre plates and plate
cultures pooled in such a way as to enable a PCR-based
screen of the library [37]. A total of 271 microtitre plates
of clones were used as the basis for the screen. Each plate
was represented in three superpools so that, following
DNA extraction, a PCR screen of 147 DNA superpools
would generate three positive amplifications per positive
BAC colony. Once the superpools had been created, 50 ml
plastic tubes containing the pooled cultures from up to
seven plates were centrifuged at 5000 rpm in a model
5403 centrifuge (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). The
supernatants were discarded and the pellets frozen at 80°C. BAC DNA was isolated from the stored pellets
using an alkaline lysis method, which included RNase in
the resuspension buffer. Superpool DNA was precipitated
using isopropanol, the pellet washed with 70% ethanol
and resuspended in TE.
PCR-based screen of the BAC library
The DNA superpools of the BAC library were screened
using PCR primers for amplification of individual genes.
PCR primers were designed from sequences of five T. pratense PPO genes: PPO1 [GenBank: AY017302.1], PPO2
[GenBank: AY017303.1] and PPO3 [GenBank:
AY017304.1] and from partial PPO4 and PPO5 sequences

identified in this study. Following the initial BAC library
screen, PCR primer pairs were also designed for PPO1 variants PPO1/2, PPO1/4 and PPO1/5 (Table 2).
Isolation and identification of genes in PPO family
PPO fragments were generated by PCR from red clover
genomic DNA (cultivar Milvus) with degenerate primers
based on regions of homology to PPO genes from T. pratense and Vicia faba (PPO deg; Table 2). PCR amplification
products were visualised on an agarose gel, excised, purified and cloned into E. coli (Invitrogen Topo TA Cloning®
kit with pCR®2.1 TOPO® vector and TOP 10 One Shot®
Cells). Inserts were sequenced and a number of PPO genes
were detected, including two novel genes designated
PPO4 and PPO5. PPO4 and PPO5 were isolated from the
BAC library using specific primers (Table 2) designed to
specifically amplify individual genes. Three variants of
PPO1 (PPO1/2, PPO1/4 and PPO1/5) were also
sequenced These PPO1 variants were designated codes
according to their juxtaposition with other PPO genes on
BAC clones: PPO1/2, PPO1/4 and PPO1/5 were initially
detected on BAC clones along with PPO2, PPO4 or PPO5,
respectively. Once identified, selected PCR-positive BACs
for each gene were sequenced directly using specific primers (Table 2) and an ABI prism 3100 DNA analyser
(Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK). BAC walking was
used to generate full length gene and upstream promoter
sequences of PPO genes.
Sequencing and in-silico analysis
Sequencing of PCR products and BAC clone plasmids was
carried out using an ABI-3100 Genetic Analyser (Applied
Biosystems) using fluorescent dye terminators. A BAC
clone (designated 212 G7) harbouring genes PPO1/5,

Sequences were assembled and further analysed using
Vector NTI software and NCBI/BLAST and FASTA programs. Sequences were compared to public DNA, EST and
protein (NCBI) databases and existing red clover PPO
gene sequences to confirm their identity.
PPO DNA sequences were aligned in Vector NTI Advance
10, based on ClustalW algorithm, and displayed in
PHYLIP 3.67. For valid comparisons, DNA sequences of
all selected plant species were aligned with the shortest
available PPO sequence (PPO1/2; 1413 bp) and truncated
in line with this sequence: the truncated sequences contain the conserved domain. DNA sequence data were analysed statistically by Maximum Likelihood Method and
the phylogeny tree was generated using PHYLIP http://
