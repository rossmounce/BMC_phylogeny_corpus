Abstract
Background: The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a major laboratory model in biology. Only ten Caenorhabditis
species were available in culture at the onset of this study. Many of them, like C. elegans, were mostly isolated
from artificial compost heaps, and their more natural habitat was unknown.
Results: Caenorhabditis nematodes were found to be proliferating in rotten fruits, flowers and stems. By collecting
a large worldwide set of such samples, 16 new Caenorhabditis species were discovered. We performed mating tests
to establish biological species status and found some instances of semi-fertile or sterile hybrid progeny. We
established barcodes for all species using ITS2 rDNA sequences. By obtaining sequence data for two rRNA and nine
protein-coding genes, we determined the likely phylogenetic relationships among the 26 species in culture. The
new species are part of two well-resolved sister clades that we call the Elegans super-group and the Drosophilae
super-group. We further scored phenotypic characters such as reproductive mode, mating behavior and male tail
morphology, and discuss their congruence with the phylogeny. A small space between rays 2 and 3 evolved once
in the stem species of the Elegans super-group; a narrow fan and spiral copulation evolved once in the stem
species of C. angaria, C. sp. 8 and C. sp. 12. Several other character changes occurred convergently. For example,
hermaphroditism evolved three times independently in C. elegans, C. briggsae and C. sp. 11. Several species can cooccur in the same location or even the same fruit. At the global level, some species have a cosmopolitan
distribution: C. briggsae is particularly widespread, while C. elegans and C. remanei are found mostly or exclusively in
temperate regions, and C. brenneri and C. sp. 11 exclusively in tropical zones. Other species have limited
distributions, for example C. sp. 5 appears to be restricted to China, C. sp. 7 to West Africa and C. sp. 8 to the
Eastern United States.
Conclusions: Caenorhabditis are “fruit worms”, not soil nematodes. The 16 new species provide a resource and
their phylogeny offers a framework for further studies into the evolution of genomic and phenotypic characters.

Background
The nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans is a key
laboratory model system which has provided key
insights into molecular biology (e.g. RNA interference
and small RNAs), cell biology (cell polarity, apoptosis),
developmental biology (signal transduction pathways,
developmental timing) and neurobiology (axon guidance,

synaptic function). The use of C. elegans and related
species for evolutionary biology has recently increased
[see [1-9]]. Several characteristics make this roundworm
an interesting species for evolutionary studies, among
them the accumulated knowledge on its biology, its simplicity of use (including the ability to cryogenically preserve living strains) and its selfing mode of reproduction
with facultative outcrossing.
However, C. elegans lacks an extensive evolutionary
framework of closely related species, especially when
compared to Drosophila melanogaster. Ten Caenorhabditis species were available in culture prior to this work,

compared with over 2000 described Drosophila species
[10]. More Caenorhabditis species are known from the
literature [11,12] but they have not been re-isolated and
are thus not available for further studies. In addition,
molecular divergence among Caenorhabditis species is
greater than among Drosophila species [3]. For example
C. elegans and C. briggsae, regarded as close relatives
within Caenorhabditis, are probably as distant as D.
melanogaster and D. ananassae, regarded as fairly distant relatives within Drosophila [13,14]. The tiny size of
these animals and the small number of taxonomists
focusing on this taxonomic group may explain in great
part the paucity of described species.
A key additional reason for the lack of known diversity in the Caenorhabditis genus is that these so-called
“soil nematodes” are rarely found in soil samples. Soil
samples yield a variety of nematode species, including a
few species of the family Rhabditidae (to which Caenorhabditis belongs). For example, some Oscheius species
are readily found in soil samples [15]. However, despite
extensive sampling for many years, we failed to isolate
Caenorhabditis from soil [16]. Rare positive instances
correspond to soil of orchards (e.g. C. elegans strain
JU258, Madeira 2001), or soil below trees with rotting
fruits (C. sp. 5 JU727). Instead, C. elegans, C. briggsae
and C. remanei were found in compost heaps containing
decaying vegetal material [11,17].
We screened rotting vegetal material for the presence
of Caenorhabditis and found that Caenorhabditis species are most readily isolated from rotting fruits and
flowers, and occasionally from other rotten plant parts
(e.g. banana pseudo-stems, but rarely leaves). Focusing
on rotten fruit samples, we found a number of new isolates of C. elegans, C. briggsae, C. remanei and C. brenneri. In addition, we collected sixteen new
Caenorhabditis species, which dramatically increased the
number of Caenorhabditis species presently in culture
to 26. We obtained sequences of SSU and LSU rRNA
genes and of nine protein-coding genes in these new
isolates and built an expanded molecular phylogeny of
the genus Caenorhabditis. We tested the new species
for reproductive isolation by pairwise mating tests.
Finally, we explored the ITS regions of the rRNA gene
array for their suitability as a barcode and found that a
specimen can reliably be assigned to one of the Caenorhabditis species in culture using the ITS2 sequence.
Finally, we report on the evolution of a number of phenotypic characters in the genus, including the mode of
reproduction.

transport to provide some oxygen to the samples, and
excessive heat was avoided. Caenorhabditis individuals
could be retrieved after up to three weeks of sample
storage.
Collected samples were placed in the laboratory on
standard C. elegans culture plates seeded in the center
with the E. coli OP50 strain. The samples were deposited outside the bacterial lawn and humidified by addition of one to three milliliters of water or M9 buffer
[18]. Caenorhabditis nematodes are attracted by the E.
coli lawn and tend to remain on the lawn, often along
the thicker lawn edge. They can often be recognized
with a dissecting microscope equipped with transillumination (40-50×) by a combination of morphological criteria: the color of their intestine (light brown), the large
intestinal cell nuclei visible as white disks on the brown
intestinal cytoplasm background, the long and fine tail
of the adult hermaphrodite, the vulva position in the
center of the animal, and the short and round tail tip in
the adult male [18]. Using a compound microscope
equipped with differential interference contrast, further
scorable characters are the presence of a round median
pharyngeal bulb, the characteristic vulva cell division
pattern [2], and the shape and arrangement of rays in
the male tail, including a ray 6 that lacks a tip opening
to the outside and which tapers from a wide base [12].
Cultures were established by isolation of a single animal with a female soma. For gonochoristic species, we
picked either a female with a copulatory plug, or one
female and one male. The mode of reproduction was
determined by isolating virgin L4 females/hermaphrodites and scoring for the presence of progeny. For selfing isolates, isogenic strains were produced by isolating
a single larva for a few (3-6) generations. For malefemale isolates, strains were established as isofemale
lines or cryopreserved as large, multi-founder populations to maintain the sample’s genetic diversity. Most
strains are listed in WormBase (http://www.wormbase.
org) and in http://www.justbio.com/worms/index.php
and will soon be listed with distribution maps in RhabditinaDB (http://wormtails.bio.nyu.edu).

Methods

Isolates with a male-female mode of reproduction

Sampling and isolation

3-6 fourth larval stage (L4) females and 3-6 L4 or adult
males were placed on a 55-mm Petri dish seeded with
E. coli OP50 to mate. The cross was scored regularly for

Rotting vegetal material was sampled and stored in
tubes or plastic bags. Care was taken during storage and

Species identification and mating tests

Males and females from new Caenorhabditis isolates
were compared at the morphological level with known
species either by studying them alongside individuals
from cultured strains or by consulting published species
descriptions. If the morphology of a new isolate was not
unique, mating tests were performed with individuals of
morphologically similar strains.

Kiontke et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:339
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/339

the presence of laid embryos, hatched larvae, and fertile
adults. Most crosses were performed at least in duplicates. Many crosses between different Caenorhabditis
species were successful at the mating behavior level, as
evidenced by the presence of a mating plug deposited
by the male on the female vulva, yet no embryos were
laid. Other crosses produced dead embryos, and in
some cases sterile female larval and adult progeny
(Additional File 1). F1 sterility was assessed by placing
F1 females either with sibling males from the same cross
(if any) or males from either parental genotype.
Isolates with a selfing mode of reproduction

Hermaphrodites mostly produce hermaphrodite progeny
upon selfing, and rare males by non-disjunction of the ×
chromosome. The cross-progeny of (cross-fertile) hermaphrodites and males consists of about 50% males. To
test for cross-fertility, 3-6 hermaphrodites of one isolate
were placed with 3-6 males of the other isolate on a 55mm Petri dish seeded with E. coli OP50. The presence
of numerous males (over 20%, much more than on control plates seeded with only hermaphrodites) on a plate
indicates a successful cross and provides a test for biological species [19].
PCR, sequencing and sequence alignment

We attempted to obtain partial sequences of 11 genes
for all Caenorhabditis species: genes for SSU and LSU
rRNA, the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II
(RNAP2, ama-1 in C. elegans) as in [3] and lin-44
(encoding a Wnt signaling factor), par-6 (encoding a
PDZ-domain-containing protein), pkc-3 (encoding an
atypical protein kinase C) and the orthologs of C. elegans genes ZK686.3 (G43, orthologous to the putative
tumor suppressor N33), W02B12.9 (G140, orthologous
to the mitochondrial carrier protein MRS3/4), ZK795.3
(G3857, orthologous to a U3 small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein component), Y97E10AL.2 (OMCL4763, a predicted alpha/beta hydrolase) and Y45G12B.2a
(OMCL4988, a predicted E3 ubiquitin ligase). Most of
these genes were chosen for their expected information
content for phylogenetic analysis as derived from genome sequences of six Caenorhabditis species (C. elegans,
C. brenneri, C. briggsae, C. remanei, C. japonica and C.
angaria) and some EST sequences for C. sp. 5 [20].
That is, from candidate genes with unambiguous alignments among 1:1 orthologs, we chose those which provided some resolution in a phylogenetic analysis with
the above six species (data not shown). Such genes promised to have sufficient nucleotide variation to resolve
relationships between closely related Caenorhabditis
species. Degenerate primers were designed to regions
conserved in these Caenorhabditis species and in Pristionchus pacificus (see Additional File 2). SSU and LSU
rDNA was amplified from worm lysates as described

Page 3 of 18

previously [3]. Sequences of protein coding genes were
amplified from cDNA as follows. Total RNA was isolated from mixed stage worms with the Qiagen RNeasy
Mini kit following the tissue protocol or with Trizol. RT
PCR was performed either with the Qiagen OneStep RT
PCR kit using specific primers, or by first-strand cDNA
synthesis (with the Transcriptor High Fidelity cDNA
Synthesis kit (Roche) using anchored oligo-dT primers,
or with the Protoscript kit by New England Biolabs, or
with the Invitrogen Superscript III kit using random primers), followed by PCR with gene-specific primers. PCR
products were purified and sequenced through Agencourt, or in-house with the Wizard VC Gel and PCR
clean-up System (Promega) and the ABI BigDye Terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems).
Electrophoresis was performed on an ABI 3730 DNA
Analyzer. Some PCR products were cleaned using the
Zymoclean Gel DNA Recovery kit and sequenced at the
University of Utah core facility. Sequences were
assembled with Sequencher (Gene Codes) and deposited
at GenBank under the accession numbers listed in Additional File 3. Alignments for protein coding genes were
generated with ClustalX [21] and were in some cases
manually improved by aligning the amino acid sequence.
The rRNA sequences were also aligned with ClustalX.
These alignments were largely unambiguous.
As barcodes for quick and easy identification of Caenorhabditis species, we explored the ITS regions
between SSU rRNA and LSU rRNA. It proved easiest to
amplify ITS1 and ITS2 separately with one primer in
the highly conserved 5.8S region in each case (Additional File 2). Sequences were generated as described
above. The sequences, which contained highly conserved
anchor regions in the rRNA genes, were aligned using
ClustalX or Muscle, which is optimized for aligning
sequences with highly diverged segments, such as
introns and intergenic sequences [22].
Phylogenetic analysis

The data file used for phylogenetic analyses was a concatenated alignment of the eleven gene segments listed
in the previous section (excluding ITS sequences, Additional File 4). Although some of these sequences were
missing for some taxa, the full dataset was used for all
phylogenetic analyses discussed here. There has been
some controversy regarding the treatment of datasets
with missing data in phylogenetic analyses [23-25].
Many simulations and tests with empirical data have
demonstrated that using datasets in which some taxa
are missing even large amounts of data do not generally
suffer ill effects. Instead, better accuracy and resolution
are generally obtained if characters with missing data
are included than if they are excluded [25]. Consistent
with these results, we also found that excluding

Kiontke et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:339
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/339

characters with missing data resulted in poorer resolution (but not significantly different topologies) than if all
characters were included (data not presented here). We
thus only report our analyses with the full dataset.
To test the data for robustness to method of phylogenetic inference, we compared the results from analyses
with weighted maximum parsimony (wMP), maximum
likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI). Robustness
of the data to character representation was tested using
bootstrap and jackknife analyses.
The wMP analysis was performed with PAUP*
ver4b10 [26]. A transversion was weighted twice a transition as in previous analyses of this taxon [3]. A jackknife analysis was performed with 1000 replicates and
two addition sequence replicates in each round.
The ML analysis (a 100-replicate bootstrap and a
thorough heuristic search) was run with RAxML ver.
7.2.8 ("BlackBox” version) via the CIPRES Science Gateway on the TeraGrid of NSF [27-30]. A six-parameter
substitution model was used with a gamma correction
for rate differences across sites (using 25 discrete categories of sites) and a correction for unvarying sites
(GTR+Γ+I). Parameters were estimated from the data.
The shape parameter for the gamma distribution of
rates was a = 0.44081. Estimated proportions of nucleotides were: π(A) = 0.264, π(C) = 0.217, π(G) = 0.260,
π(T) = 0.259. Estimated rates for the GTR model were: f
(AC) = 1.390, f(AG) = 3.120, f(AT) = 1.182, f(CG) =
1.115, f(CT) = 5.790, relative to f(GT) = 1.000.
Another analysis of the same dataset was performed
using Bayesian Inference (BI) as implemented in
MrBayes ver. 3.1.2 [31,32] via the CIPRES portal
[27,28,33]. A six-parameter substitution model was used
with a gamma correction for rate differences across sites
and an estimate for the proportion of invariant sites
(GTR+Γ+I). The analysis was stopped automatically by
MrBayes at 4,055,000 generations (due to convergence
of all parameters). Trees and parameters were sampled
every 1000 generations for a total of 1,556 samples. Burnin was set to 50% of the samples to calculate the clade
credibility values (posterior probabilities) and to estimate the model parameters, which were: π(A) = 0.265,
π(C) = 0.217, π(G) = 0.256, π(T) = 0.262. Estimated
rates for the GTR model were: f(AC) = 1.296, f(AG) =
2.284, f(AT) = 1.108, f(CG) = 1.147, f(CT) = 3.678, relative to f(GT) = 1.000. In the final tree, only one branch
had a clade credibility value less than 100 (i.e., a branch
that placed C. sp. 20 with C. angaria, C. drosophilae, C,
sp. 2, 8 and 12, exclusive of C. sp. 6 and 13).
Genetic divergence

To estimate the genetic divergence within Caenorhabditis (and for comparisons with other taxa), we calculated
the amount of nucleotide change along the branches of

Page 4 of 18

the phylogeny using maximum likelihood implemented
in PAUP* and the sequences of RNAP2. This gene was
used because previous results showed that the rRNA
genes–but not RNAP2–display significant heterotachy
[3], and RNAP2 was the only protein-coding gene that
we could sequence for all species. All parameters for a
general time-reversible model were estimated from the
data. For comparison, we also calculated branch lengths
for an RNAP2 dataset from 12 Drosophila species with
the topology from [14]. The data matrix is found in
Additional File 5.
ITS2 Barcodes

To test the utility of ITS2 sequences (i.e. the intergenic
region between 5.8S and LSU rRNA genes) for distinguishing which isolates belong to which Caenorhabditis
species, we sequenced this region for several strains of
the species that were isolated more than once. The
sequences, which contained the highly conserved 5.8S
rDNA at the 5’ end and part of the LSU rDNA at the 3’
end, were aligned with ClustalX and then trimmed
down to the ITS2 sequence only, following the annotation of the rRNA gene structure of C. elegans [34]).
This data matrix is presented in Additional File 6. This
alignment was used to determine the pairwise differences between species and strains. To represent these
differences graphically, we calculated the branch length
of a tree for all strains. This tree was reconstructed
based on the ITS2 sequences with MP, using the species
phylogeny as a constraint. A heuristic search yielded
eight most parsimonious trees, one of which was chosen
for further analysis. Branch lengths of this tree were
determined by parsimony and include indels (one
change per gap, regardless of the length of the gap).
Changes with ambiguous branch assignment were optimized with ACCTRAN. ACCTRAN was used to offset
somewhat the underestimation by parsimony of changes
occurring in deeper branches. Correcting for superimposed changes demonstrates even greater discernibility
between intra- and interspecific differences, suggesting
that the parsimony approach is conservative. Pairwise
intraspecific differences were manually tabulated as transitions, transversions, and indels.

Results and discussion
Sampling of rotting plant parts yielded many
Caenorhabditis isolates including 16 new species

We systematically sampled rotting fruits and found that
roughly one third of the samples contained at least one
Caenorhabditis species. In rotting fruits, Caenorhabditis
nematodes were present as adults and larvae of all
stages, sometimes in large numbers. This is in contrast
to previous records from soil and even from compost,
where most individuals were in the dauer larva stage

Kiontke et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:339

[35]. We further sampled other types of rotting vegetal
material (Figure 1) and failed to find Caenorhabditis
species in wood. However, we did find them in rotting
flowers, plant stems, and sometimes in leaves (Additional Files 7 and 8).
By sampling rotting fruits, flowers and stems in various temperate and tropical regions of the world, several
hundred cultures of different Caenorhabditis species
were established. Crosses with established cultures of
known species revealed that many of the new isolates
belonged to four already described species, namely C.
elegans, C. briggsae, C. remanei and C. brenneri (Additional File 7).

Sixteen additional species were identified by unique
morphology or by the absence of fertile cross-progeny
when mated with isolates of previously known species
with similar morphology (Additional File 1). Comparisons with published species descriptions suggest that all
of these species are new to science. We provisionally
refer to these newly cultured species by numbers, sp. 5
to sp. 20 (Table 1).
Some of the new species were sampled many times,
whereas some others are currently represented by single
isolates (Additional File 8). For the species sampled
many times, we could not find any clear substrate preference. For example, C. sp. 11 was found in rotting

Phylogenetic relationships

To elucidate the phylogenetic relationships of the 26
Caenorhabditis species in culture, we performed phylogenetic analyses with three methods, maximum likelihood bootstrap (ML) using RAxML, Bayesian inference
(BI) using MrBayes, and weighted maximum parsimony
(wMP) using PAUP*. All methods resulted largely in the
same topology with high support for most branches in
the ML and BI analyses (Figure 2). There is some uncertainty about the positions of C. sp. 15 and C. sp. 20
which differ from those shown in Figure 2 in the wMP
analysis (C. sp. 15) or in the BI analysis (C. sp. 20),
respectively. However, the support for the alternative
placements of these species is low in each case.
The phylogeny supports the following grouping: C. sp.
1 branches off first and the second branch is C. plicata.
This branching pattern is the same as in a previous analysis with only 11 Caenorhabditis species but with 54
species outside of Caenorhabditis [2], suggesting that
the choice of P. pacificus as the outgroup representative

had no effect on the overall tree topology. The remaining Caenorhabditis species fall into two monophyletic
groups, the Elegans super-group and the Drosophilae
super-group (Figure 2). Within the Elegans super-group,
we find two subclades, which we call the Japonica
group and the Elegans group. The Japonica group consists of C. spp. 7, 14, 17-19 and C. japonica. The monophyly of this group is well supported by likelihood
analyses and less so by wMP. C. sp. 15 appears to be
the sister species of the Japonica group. The Elegans
group comprises the remaining Elegans super-group
species. Their relationships are highly supported in all
analyses. C. elegans forms the first branch of this group.
The other Elegans group species fall in two clades, one
comprising C. briggsae, C. remanei and C. spp. 5 and 9,
the other one comprising C. brenneri and C. spp. 10, 11
and 16. None of the 26 Caenorhabditis species in this
analysis is the sister species of C. elegans. Within the
Drosophilae super-group, C. drosophilae and C. sp. 2
form the Drosophilae group which is the sister taxon to
the highly supported Angaria group composed of C.
angaria plus C. sp. 12 and C. sp. 8. Of the other three
species in the Drosophilae super-group, C. sp. 6 and 13
are sister species, and C. sp. 20 possibly forms the first
branch.

Figure 2 Our current best hypothesis for the phylogenetic relationships of all Caenorhabditis in culture and convergent evolution of
hermaphroditism. Depicted is result of the maximum likelihood bootstrap analysis. Numbers on branches show, respectively, the support
values for 100 bootstrap repeats in the ML analysis in percent, the posterior probabilities from the Bayesian inference analysis (blue), and the
support values for 2000 jackknife repeats in a weighted maximum parsimony analysis in percent. * Weighted maximum parsimony analysis favors
a position of C. sp. 15 as the sister species of the Elegans group with 60% support. ** Bayesian inference favors C. sp. 20 to form the sister
species of the Angaria and Drosophilae groups with a clade credibility value of 96, the lowest in this analysis. Three species (in red) reproduce as
self-fertilizing hermaphrodites with rare males, whereas all other species (in blue) are gonochoristic with females and males at approximately
equal proportions. Hermaphroditism evolved convergently in all three lineages.

rest of Caenorhabditis. The smallest genetic divergence
between two species is found between C. briggsae and
C. sp. 9 (0.079 substitutions/site), between C. angaria
and C. sp. 12 (0.068 substitutions/site), and between C.
drosophilae and C. sp. 2 (0.057 substitutions/site). Correspondingly, the first two species pairs produce viable
hybrids in mating experiments. The divergence between
these species pairs is comparable to that between Drosophila yakuba and D. erecta (0.048 substitutions/site in
RNAP2, see Additional File 9). For RNAP2, the genetic
divergence spanned by the Elegans group (C. briggsae-C.
sp. 18: 0.566 substitutions/site) is similar to that
spanned by the Sophophora subgenus of Drosophila (D.
melanogaster-D. willistoni: 0.621 substitutions/site).
Thus, we now have a similar range of genetic divergence
represented in the Caenorhabditis species as for Drosophila species. One caveat remains: we still do not know
if there exists a species which is more closely related to
C. elegans than C. briggsae or any other individual species, and the relatively long branch to C. elegans remains
“unbroken”.

World distribution

The four described species of the Elegans group occur
on several continents. The restriction of the distribution
of C. remanei to temperate regions and of C. brenneri
to tropical regions reported previously [36] is further
corroborated by our findings. The geographic distribution of the new Caenorhabditis species is depicted in
Figure 4. Of the new species, only C. sp. 6, 8 and 13
were found in temperate regions and C. sp. 5 was found
in temperate and tropical regions. All remaining new
species were sampled from tropical sites. Some of the
species that have been sampled several times are shared
between different tropical regions. C. sp. 11 was found
in La Réunion in the Indian Ocean, Puerto Rico and the
Cape Verde Islands in the Atlantic Ocean, French Guiana and Brazil in South America and Hawaii in the
Pacific Ocean. C. sp. 9 has been found in Central Africa
and South India. By contrast, C. sp. 5 has remarkably
been found exclusively in East Asia (China and Vietnam), C. sp. 7 in West Africa (Ghana, Nigeria), C. sp. 8
in the Eastern half of United States and C. sp. 10 in

South India. At a supraspecific level, the trio of C. spp.
17, 18 and 19 was found in the Neotropics, while the
noncosmopolitan species of the sister group of C. elegans were all collected in Asia. C. sp. 20 and the species
of the Angaria group and C. drosophilae were found in
the tropical and temperate Americas. C. sp. 2 was isolated from islands in the Mediterranean and the Eastern
Atlantic Ocean, however, its association with cacti and
cactophilic flies indicates that C. sp. 2 is also an American species which we currently only know from locations to which it has been introduced in historical times
[11]. Thus, with the exception of the two European species C. sp. 6 and 13, all members of the Drosophilae
super-group are New World species.
The temperature preferences of the species correlate
with the latitude of their geographic distribution.
Indeed, different from C. elegans, C. briggsae and C.
remanei, the tropical species C. spp. 7, 9, 10, 11 do not
grow at 15°C. In contrast, C. spp. 9, 10 and 11 can grow
at 30°C (but not 33°C), a character they share with C.
briggsae but not with C. elegans [[37]; M. Ailion, unpublished observations].
Several species often co-occur in the same location
and sometimes in the same individual fruit. For example, C. briggsae, C. brenneri and C. sp. 10 were all found
in the same garden in Kanjirapally, Kerala, India; C. elegans, C. briggsae and C. sp. 13 co-occurred in rotting
apples in an orchard in Orsay, France; C. briggsae, C.
brenneri and C. sp. 11 were found together in one garden in La Réunion; C. briggsae and C. sp. 14 were isolated from the same chestnut in Moorea; C. elegans and
C. sp. 6 were found in rotting apples from the same tree
in Amares, Portugal; C. briggsae and C. sp. 8 were found
in the same rotting persimmon in New York; and C.
briggsae and C. sp. 15 were found in the same small
sample of rotting flowers in Kauai, Hawaii.
Character evolution

To determine whether any evolutionary pattern for phenotypic characters can be discerned, we mapped several
such characters onto our phylogeny (Additional File 10).
Most informative morphological characters in rhabditids
are associated with the male reproductive organs
[12,38]. We therefore analyzed the 26 species for the
shapes of their spicules and of their male tail with its
fan and sensory rays. The evolution of reproductive
modes is also of particular interest in Caenorhabditis.
Reproductive mode

Caenorhabditis species have one of two modes of reproduction. They can be gonochoristic (male-female), like
C. remanei and C. brenneri, or they can be androdioecious with selfing hermaphrodites and facultative males,
like C. elegans and C. briggsae. Of the new species, only
C. sp. 11 presents the selfing mode of reproduction

Page 10 of 18

(Table 1). Tracing this character along the branches of
the phylogenetic tree of Caenorhabditis reveals that hermaphroditism likely evolved independently in each of
the three lineages (Figure 2). Assuming that evolution of
hermaphroditism and gonochorism are equally likely,
this scenario requires three evolutionary steps, whereas
the alternative hypothesis that hermaphroditism evolved
once requires six evolutionary steps (one gain of hermaphroditism and five reversals to gonochorism).
Recent studies [39-42] have discovered multiple differences in the genetic underpinnings of sex determination
in C. elegans and C. briggsae, supporting the hypothesis
that hermaphroditism evolved convergently in these two
species.
Morphology and other phenotypic characters

The spicules are the male copulatory organs, paired
cuticular structures which generally consist of a head, a
shaft and a blade which tapers to a tip. In all Caenorhabditis species, each spicule has a thin velum at the
dorsal side and a seam which separates the spicule head
from the spicule blade near the middle of the shaft (Figure 5). Differences are found in the shape of the distal
part of the spicule blade which can be broad and bent
at an angle or more evenly curved. The spicule tip can
be complex with notches or small cuticular wings, or
simple, tapering down to a narrow point. The general
shape of the spicule can be short and stout, as in C. sp.
1 and C. angaria, or longer and narrower. The distribution of these characters on the tree reveals conflicts: all
species outside of the Elegans super-group have a nonpointy, complex spicule tip, but so do C. japonica and
C. sp. 7. The most parsimonious scenario for the evolution of this character is that the simple spicule tip, as it
is present e.g. in C. elegans, evolved in the stem species
of the Elegans super-group and was reversed to a more
complex tip twice independently in C. japonica and C.
sp. 7. The slender, evenly curved shape of the spicule is
found in all species of the Elegans group and in C. sp.
14. Another character with a similar distribution is the
frequency of division of the anterior vulval precursor
cell P3.p, which is lower in species of the Elegans group
and in C. sp. 14 [43]. These characters would be nonhomoplasiously distributed if C. sp. 14 were part of the
Elegans group or its sister species, but our analyses
place C. sp. 14 in the middle of the Japonica group with
good support. Shorter and stouter spicules are found in
C. sp. 1 and in the outgroup (i.e. Protorhabditis species
[2]) as well as in the Drosophilae and Angaria groups.
This distribution suggests that the spicule length
increased after C. sp. 1 branched off and was then
reduced again in the stem species of the clade consisting
of the Drosophilae and Angaria groups.
Conflicts also exist in the distribution of characters of
the fan, a lateral extension of the cuticle at the male tail

side to the right (the spicules of C. drosophilae and C. sp. 2 and of C. angaria and C. sp. 12 are identical and are shown for only one species).
Three features of the spicule are distinguished, each with two alternative character states: the overall shape (orange boxes), the curvature of the
spicule blade (pink boxes) and the shape of the spicule tip (blue boxes). The character states for each species are indicated by filled or empty
colored boxes above the images.

which is used during copulation (Figure 6). The fan contains nine pairs of sensory rays and the opening of the
chemosensory phasmids. In all species of the Elegans
super-group, the fan is heart-shaped and anteriorly
closed and its edge is serrated. These features are
derived within Caenorhabditis. C. sp. 1, C. plicata and
the most closely related species of the outgroup, Protorhabditis [2] (see [38] for the characters of the Protorhabditis stem species), have oval open fans with a
smooth or wavy edge. However, within the Drosophilae
super-group, both types of fans occur. The fans in C. sp.
6 and C. sp. 20 have the typical heart shape. The fan in
C. sp. 13 is unique in its squarish shape and unusual
arrangements of rays, but it is anteriorly closed and has

a serrated edge. The other species have an open and
narrow fan, especially C. angaria, C. spp. 8 and 12. The
distribution of these characters on the phylogeny suggests that an anteriorly closed, heart-shaped fan with a
serrated edge evolved in the stem species of the Elegans
and Drosophilae super-groups and was reversed to a
relatively narrow, open fan with a smooth edge in the
stem species of the Drosophilae and Angaria groups. A
heart-shaped fan always co-occurs with a hook-shaped
precloacal lip. Thus, the same evolutionary scenario can
be assumed for this character. Interestingly, in C. sp. 13,
both the shape of the fan and the precloacal lip have
been modified together as well (this species has a squarish fan and lacks the hook).

Figure 6 Evolution of male tail characters. Drawings of the male tail in ventral view are shown above the Caenorhabditis phylogeny. The
male tail possesses a cuticular fan around the cloaca. Nine pairs of sensory rays are embedded in the fan. Differences between species are
found in the shape of the anterior margin and the terminal end of the fan, in the arrangement of the rays and in the shape of the precloacal lip
(cf. [12]). Seven characters of the male tail with two character states each are mapped onto the tree. The mating position is included as an
eighth character. The spiral mating position is found only in the Angaria group (C. angaria, C. sp. 12 and C. sp. 8). It is correlated with a
particularly narrow fan (compare the images). Male tails are largely identical in all species of the Elegans group, in C. drosophilae and C. sp. 2 and
in C. angaria and C. sp. 12.

Another conflict between the molecular data (supporting the phylogeny presented here) and a morphological
character concerns the position of one of the three pairs
of rays which are attached to the dorsal surface of the
fan. In all species of the Drosophilae super-group, the
three dorsal rays are in positions 1, 4 and 7, counted
from anterior, whereas in all species of the Elegans
super-group the dorsal rays are in position 1, 5 and 7
(Figure 6). Thus, the middle dorsal ray is in a different
position. A middle dorsal ray in position 5 is also found
in C. sp. 1 and in the Caenorhabditis sister group (the
Protorhabditis group, see [38] for characters of the stem
species), but not in C. plicata. Since the position of C.
sp. 1, C. plicata, the Drosophilae super-group and the
Elegans super-group are well supported, the distribution

of this character requires at least two evolutionary steps,
either two shifts of the middle dorsal ray from position
5 to 4 in the Drosophilae super-group and in C. plicata,
or one shift from position 5 to 4 after the branch to C.
sp. 1 and a reversal to the ancestral situation (middle
dorsal ray in pos. 5) in the Elegans super-group. Likewise, the occurrence of a particularly short ray 4 is
homoplasious, as it is found in C. japonica, C. sp. 14, 17
and 19. The distribution of this character requires at
least three evolutionary steps.
The ability to start an RNA interference response
upon external administration of double-stranded actin
RNAs was tested on all new species (Nuez and Félix,
submitted). This character has a complex distribution.
Competence to external RNAi is absent in all species of

Kiontke et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:339
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/339

the sister clade of C. elegans, in the clade comprising C.
spp. 17, 18 and 19, in C. plicata and in all species of the
Angaria and Drosophilae group but not in C. sp. 6, C.
sp. 13 and C. sp. 20 (Nuez and Félix, submitted). Mapping of this character onto the phylogeny suggests that
competence to respond to external dsRNA may have
been present in the Caenorhabditis stem species and
was lost four times independently.
There are also characters which are mostly unambiguously distributed and thus constitute reliable apomorphic characters for certain monophyletic groups that
are supported by molecular data: In most species of the
Elegans super-group, the distal end of the fan is
notched. This terminal notch is particularly large in the
monophyletic group consisting of C. sp. 17, 18 and 19.
The Elegans super-group is characterized by a small
space between the second and third ray (smaller than
the space between the third and fourth ray or of similar
size), when compared to the other Caenorhabditis species in which this space is always bigger (Figure 6). A
particularly narrow fan is found in C. angaria, C. sp. 8
and C. sp. 12. Also, these species share papilliform phasmids, a very similar spicule shape, and a spiral mating
position in which the male is coiled around the female
(Figures 5 and 6). In addition, C. angaria, C. sp. 8 and
C. sp. 12 all have a short stoma with a bifurcated projection at each sector of the metastegostom (see illustrations in [44] for C. angaria). Thus, the monophyly of
the Angaria group is exceptionally well supported by
morphological and molecular characters. A number of
previously mentioned phenotypic characters support the
sister group relationships of the Angaria and Drosophilae groups even though their distribution across all Caenorhabditis species is homoplastic: In all species of both
clades the spicule is short, the fan is open and lacks a
serrated edge, and all species are insensitive to externally
administered double-stranded RNA (against actin). A
sister group relationship of these two clades has been
proposed earlier [44], based on molecular data and on
the presence of one semicircular flap on each lip seen
on SEM images of C. angaria and C. drosophilae. The
presence of this flap needs to be confirmed for the
other species of these groups, but could constitute a
further apomorphy. The geographic distribution of their
members suggest that the Angaria and Drosophilae
groups originated in the New World.
ITS2 is a suitable barcode for distinguishing
Caenorhabditis species

Morphology can be used to assign species to the major
groups within Caenorhabditis, but some species within
these groups look very similar or entirely alike. In fact,
the genus contains a host of morphological sibling species. Therefore, morphology alone is not suitable for

Page 13 of 18

identifying new species. In this study, species were initially identified via mating tests (Additional File 1). However, with a growing number of species, mating tests
become tedious and time-consuming. Unlike morphology, genomic sequences contain many easily accessible
species-specific differences. We thus sought a genetic
barcode for Caenorhabditis species.
As suitable targets for barcoding in nematodes, De Ley
et al. [45] proposed the use of SSU and LSU rDNA
sequences. However, within Caenorhabditis, SSU rDNA
is very highly conserved and can be identical in closely
related species (e.g. in C. angaria and C. sp. 12). LSU
rDNA, specifically the D2D3 region, is usually more
variable, but C. briggsae and C. sp. 9 differ in only five
positions over the entire LSU locus (three substitutions
and two indels). Such a small number of differences can
be easily concealed by sequencing errors. Here, we
explore the ITS region instead. Both internal transcribed
spacers are variable between species. In more distantly
related species, the unambiguously alignable portions of
the ITS regions are very short. However, the flanking
rRNA gene sequences are highly conserved. Thus, PCR
with primers in the flanking sequences reliably amplifies
the ITS regions. The flanking sequences can also serve
as anchors for alignments.
The ITS1 region was often variable within a species
and even within one animal, making direct sequencing
of PCR products problematic (data not shown). ITS2
was less polymorphic in the strains tested, although
here, too, we found four strains with indel polymorphisms that precluded sequencing of the entire region
without cloning. Nevertheless, the parts of ITS2 that
could be sequenced directly from PCR products were
long enough to enable species identification.
To see whether the genetic divergence between different isolates of the same biological species (as determined by mating tests) was smaller than that between
species, we sequenced the ITS2 region of at least two
strains from several species which have been isolated
more than once. We found that, with one exception, the
differences between two strains were smaller than the
differences between two most closely related species
pairs, C. briggsae and C. sp. 9 (AF16 vs. JU1325: 20 substitutions and six indels) and C. angaria and C. sp. 12
(24 substitutions, 7 indels). (Figure 7 and Additional File
11). Aside from C. sp. 8 (see below), the most differences were found between C. remanei strains with 11
substitutions and 1 indel between the two most dissimilar strains (e.g. VX0088 from China and PB206 from
Ohio). Recent results of mating tests between strains
from China and Ohio assigned to C. remanei showed
hybrid breakdown in the F2 generation, indicating that
these strains may actually belong to two separate biological species (Asher Cutter and Alivia Dey, pers.

Figure 7 Graphic representation of differences in the ITS2 region between and within Caenorhabditis species as branch lengths of a
tree for 50 Caenorhabditis strains. Branch length was determined by maximum parsimony (see Methods). With one exception (* C. sp. 8), the
differences between strains of the same species (blue boxes) are smaller than the smallest differences between the two most closely related
species pairs (orange boxes). In all cases, the differences separating any pair of species is much greater than the differences separating strains of
the corresponding species. **The differences between C. remanei strains are larger than the differences seen within other species. Recently,
however, hybrid breakdown has been observed in matings between strain VX0088 from China and several strains from Ohio, congruent with the
long ITS2 branch of the Chinese isolates (Asher Cutter and Alivia Dey, pers. comm).

comm.). The strain EM464 from New York also differs
by ten substitutions from other C. remanei strains from
Ohio and Germany and it remains to be tested whether
hybrids between these strains are fully fertile. To our
surprise, we found large differences between the strains
of C. sp. 8, all collected from locations in the Eastern
USA. The ITS2 sequence of these strains has an area
with imperfect repeats which in strain QX1182 is 199
nucleotides shorter than in strain DF5106 (50 vs. 249).
The same region contains indel polymorphisms in strain
APS1 and could not be sequenced from PCR products.
Despite these differences, C. sp. 8 can be easily identified based on the ITS2 region. Thus, this molecule

attach to weevils, drosophilid flies or burrower bugs,
respectively [44,46,48]. Other species, including C. elegans and C. briggsae, have been isolated from phoretic
carriers [11] and it is likely that phoretic relationships
exist for many or all other Caenorhabditis species.
How many Caenorhabditis species are there?

Extensive collecting of Caenorhabditis from rotting
plant material has yielded new species even from regions
that were already fairly well sampled, e.g. Europe and
the Eastern United States (C. spp. 6, 8 and 13). Over the
last six years, 16 new species were found (Figure 8). We
therefore expect that the discovery of new Caenorhabditis species will continue. It is likely that we have only
scratched the surface of Caenorhabditis biodiversity.

Conclusions

Remarks on the geographic range

Caenorhabditis are “fruit worms”, not soil nematodes

Our new records corroborate the observation that of all
Caenorhabditis species, only C. briggsae and C. elegans
are cosmopolitan (Figure 4 and Additional File 12).
However, only C. briggsae seems to be equally common
in temperate and tropical regions. C. elegans was
recorded from tropical Africa at high altitude sites (2000
m and above) in Limuru, Kenya [49] and Addis Ababa,
Ethiopia (data courtesy of Dee Denver) and on islands
such as La Réunion (at altitude 1100 m) or Hawaii (at
an unknown altitude). Two other species have been
found in temperate as well as in tropical regions: C. plicata was found in Germany and Kenya and C. sp. 5
occurs in temperate and tropical China and in Vietnam.

species number

Our study has shown beyond doubt that the best place
to find Caenorhabditis species is rotten fruit. Of the 26
Caenorhabditis species currently in culture, all but
seven have been isolated from rotten fruit, although
most species have also been found in other rotting plant
material. We do not yet know whether any Caenorhabditis species is a strict fruit specialist, but it is likely that
C. japonica is specific for the fruit of Schoepfia jasminodera [46]. The information which we have gathered to
date shows that the habitats of these nematodes are
strikingly similar to those of Drosophila species. Many
Drosophila species, including D. melanogaster, can be
found in various fermenting fruit and fungi, but there
are also specialists for particular fruit like figs or those
that specialize on breeding in flowers [47]. Furthermore,
some Drosophila species are specialists for rotten cactus,
as are C. drosophilae and C. sp. 2 [11], and others breed
in fungi, a habitat from which C. sp. 1 and C. auriculariae have been isolated [11]. Further samplings of Caenorhabditis species may discover more parallels between
the habitats of these genera. It should be noted that at
least two Caenorhabditis species live in a habitat quite
different from rotten fruit, namely decomposing animal
tissue. C. plicata has only been found in carrion and C.
bovis (not included here for the lack of material for
molecular analyses) lives in the inflamed ears of cattle
[11]. Taking all of our sampling data together, it is clear
that Caenorhabditis are not soil nematodes. The only
stage which is occasionally found in soil is the dauer
larva. In this respect, Caenorhabditis species do not differ much from the majority of rhabditid nematode species which also reproduce in substrates rich in nutrients
and bacteria. Nematodes that specialize in such habitats
often use other animals for dispersal. Such phoresy is
indeed an essential part of the life cycle of C. angaria,
C. drosophilae and C. japonica where the dauer larvae

Figure 8 Discovery rate of Caenorhabditis species. The number
of Caenorhabditis species is plotted cumulatively by year of
description or discovery (if known). As of 2010, there were 38
Caenorhabditis species; this is a maximum number, since 6 of the 20
described species are not very well known and are potentially
synonymous with other species [11]. The 16 species reported in this
study were discovered between 2005 and 2010. The rate of
discovery has increased since sampling efforts have focused on
rotting fruit and other decaying plant material. The shape of this
curve suggests that only a fraction of Caenorhabditis species is
presently known.

The remaining Caenorhabditis species for which we
have more than one record were either isolated from
tropical or from temperate regions but not from both.
Of the 16 Elegans super-group species in culture, ten
were found exclusively in the tropics and only two (C.
remanei and C. japonica) are exclusively temperate. In
contrast, only three of the ten non-Elegans super-group
species are only found in the tropics. This suggests a
radiation of Elegans super-group species occurred in
tropical regions. However, this picture can easily change
in the future, since our knowledge of Caenorhabditis
biogeography is still very sketchy. The southern hemisphere has been only sparsely sampled and there is
almost no information about the distribution of Caenorhabditis species in southern temperate regions.
Phylogeny and character evolution

In this study, we used the sequences of 11 genes to
reconstruct the phylogeny of Caenorhabditis species.
Our analyses yielded a tree with some very wellresolved areas, but there are also branches which are
weakly supported. More sequence information is
needed to resolve all branches with high confidence.
However, the current phylogeny is a usable working
hypothesis which allows us to draw some sound conclusions: (1) Caenorhabditis comprises two monophyletic sister groups, the Elegans super-group with 16
species currently in culture, and the Drosophilae
super-group with eight species. (2) None of the species
in the Elegans super-group is more closely related to
C. elegans than C. brenneri, C. briggsae or C. remanei;
i.e., we do not yet know of an extant sister species of
C. elegans. (3) Morphologically, the Elegans supergroup species are more uniform than the Drosophilae
super-group species, making it particularly difficult to
identify any of the individual Elegans super-group species by morphology alone. (4) With the exception of C.
briggsae and C. sp. 9, all of these species are fully
reproductively isolated and genetically divergent.
A closer look at a small number of morphological
characters showed that almost none of them had an
unambiguous distribution on our current phylogeny. For
almost all morphological characters, conflicts existed
between each other and/or the molecular data that were
used to reconstruct the phylogeny. This observation
matches previous findings for character evolution in
rhabditid nematodes which showed that homoplasy
(convergent or parallel evolution) is a common theme in
this group [2,50,51]. Importantly, our current study confirms that hermaphroditism evolved convergently in C.
briggsae and C. elegans. Furthermore, we found that hermaphroditism evolved a third time in one of the new
Caenorhabditis species, C. sp. 11.

New Caenorhabditis species as a resource for future
studies

The new Caenorhabditis species provide a phylogenetic
framework to study the evolution of a number of genomic and phenotypic traits. At the molecular level, previously analyzed species were very distant from each
other [3], and nucleotide turnover at putatively neutral
sites was saturated, preventing the application of several
molecular evolution tests. The new species provide several cases of more closely related species pairs, especially
the C. briggsae/C. sp. 9 [52,53], C. drosophilae/C. sp. 2
and C. angaria/C. sp. 12 comparisons (Figure 2). In
addition, the level of polymorphism within some of the
new gonochoristic species is high, e.g. in C. sp. 5 where
it is comparable to that of the ascidian Ciona savignyi
[54]. Intraspecific genome comparisons in such cases
are likely to reveal which parts of the genome are less
constrained than other parts. Active genome sequencing
is presently ongoing for the new Caenorhabditis species
(see http://www.nematodes.org/nematodegenomes), and
data are already available for C. spp. 7, 9 and 11 from
the Genome Center at Washington University and GenBank, and C. sp. 5 from Genepool at the University of
Edinburgh.
Some species provide interesting phenotypic features.
For instance, C. sp. 11 provides a third example–after C.
elegans and C. briggsae–of independent evolution of
hermaphroditism from a gonochoristic ancestor. C. sp. 9
and C. briggsae are the first species pair in Caenorhabditis with partially fertile progeny, providing a genetic
entry into species isolation studies [52,53]. These two
species have different modes of reproduction (gonochoristic for C. sp. 9, hermaphroditic for C. briggsae), thus
also allowing for genetic studies of reproductive mode
evolution. Other species pairs, such as C. angaria and
C. sp. 12, offer sterile hybrids of both sexes, and crosses
of C. sp. 5 and C. briggsae yield sterile adult females
with abnormal gonads (Additional File 1). Another
example is sperm size, which is under selection in these
nematodes [55,56]. Hermaphrodites have smaller sperm
than males [57], males in hermaphroditic species have
smaller sperm than males in gonochoristic species [57],
and as a surprising extreme, C. sp. 18 males produce
giant sperm (Additional File 13). These new species considerably widen the spectrum of phenotypic evolution
that can be studied using Caenorhabditis.
