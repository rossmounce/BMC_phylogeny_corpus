Abstract
Background: Bacterial spot of tomato and pepper is caused by four Xanthomonas species and is a major plant
disease in warm humid climates. The four species are distinct from each other based on physiological and
molecular characteristics. The genome sequence of strain 85-10, a member of one of the species, Xanthomonas
euvesicatoria (Xcv) has been previously reported. To determine the relationship of the four species at the genome
level and to investigate the molecular basis of their virulence and differing host ranges, draft genomic sequences
of members of the other three species were determined and compared to strain 85-10.
Results: We sequenced the genomes of X. vesicatoria (Xv) strain 1111 (ATCC 35937), X. perforans (Xp) strain 91-118
and X. gardneri (Xg) strain 101 (ATCC 19865). The genomes were compared with each other and with the
previously sequenced Xcv strain 85-10. In addition, the molecular features were predicted that may be required for
pathogenicity including the type III secretion apparatus, type III effectors, other secretion systems, quorum sensing
systems, adhesins, extracellular polysaccharide, and lipopolysaccharide determinants. Several novel type III effectors
from Xg strain 101 and Xv strain 1111 genomes were computationally identified and their translocation was
validated using a reporter gene assay. A homolog to Ax21, the elicitor of XA21-mediated resistance in rice, and a
functional Ax21 sulfation system were identified in Xcv. Genes encoding proteins with functions mediated by type
II and type IV secretion systems have also been compared, including enzymes involved in cell wall deconstruction,
as contributors to pathogenicity.
Conclusions: Comparative genomic analyses revealed considerable diversity among bacterial spot pathogens,
providing new insights into differences and similarities that may explain the diverse nature of these strains. Genes
specific to pepper pathogens, such as the O-antigen of the lipopolysaccharide cluster, and genes unique to
individual strains, such as novel type III effectors and bacteriocin genes, have been identified providing new clues
for our understanding of pathogen virulence, aggressiveness, and host preference. These analyses will aid in efforts
towards breeding for broad and durable resistance in economically important tomato and pepper cultivars.

Background
Bacterial spot disease of tomato and pepper presents a
serious agricultural problem worldwide, leading to significant crop losses especially in regions with warm and
humid climate. The disease is characterized by necrotic
lesions on leaves, sepals and fruits, reducing yield and
fruit quality [1]. The disease is caused by a relatively
diverse set of bacterial strains within the genus

Xanthomonas; strain nomenclature and classification for
the strains that infect pepper and tomato have gone
through considerable taxonomic revision in recent years.
Currently, the pathogens are classified into four distinct
pathogen groups (A, B, C, and D) within the genus
Xanthomonas. Strains belonging to groups A, B and D
infect both tomato and pepper. Group C strains are
pathogenic only on tomato [2,3]. These phenotypically
and genotypically distinct strains have different geographic distributions. Strains of group A and B are
found worldwide. C strains have been increasingly found
in the U.S., Mexico, Brazil, Korea and regions bordering

the Indian Ocean, and D group strains are found in the
former Yugoslavia, Canada, Costa Rica, U.S, Brazil and
regions of the Indian Ocean [4-8]. Three of the four
groups except for D were originally described as a single
pathovar within Xanthomonas campestris and referred
to as X. campestris pv. vesicatoria. The D group consisted of a strain isolated from tomato that had been
designated ‘Pseudomonas gardneri’ for many years [9]
although De Ley provided evidence for placement in the
genus Xanthomonas [10]. Subsequently all four groups
were classified as separate species on the basis of physiological and molecular characteristics as follows:
Xanthomonas euvesicatoria (group A), Xanthomonas
vesicatoria (group B), Xanthomonas perforans (group C),
and Xanthomonas gardneri (group D) [11].
Based on 16S rRNA analysis, X. euvesicatoria strain
85-10 (A group) and X. perforans (C group) together
form a monophyletic group, whereas X. vesicatoria (B
group) and X. gardneri (D group) cluster together with
X. campestris pv. campestris (Xcc) Xcc strain 33913 [11].
Recently, a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on
MLST (multi-locus sequence typing) data for A, B, C
and D group strains and other xanthomonads [12]. The
MLST approach revealed that X. euvesicatoria and
X. perforans form a group along with X. citri strain 306
(Xac). X. gardneri is most closely related to X. campestris pv. campestris strains while X. vesicatoria forms a
distinct clade [12]. This diversity among the four groups
makes the Xanthomonas-tomato/pepper system an
excellent example to study pathogen co-evolution, as
distinct species have converged on a common host.
While integrated management approaches for control
of bacterial spot disease are available, the development
of host resistance is more economical and environmentally benign for the control of the disease [13,14]. Host
resistance may also be required to replace the loss of
some integrated management tools. Use of copper and
streptomycin sprays over the years, for example, has led
to the development of resistant strains [5]. At the same
time, genetic resistance has been lost due to race shifts
in pathogen populations [15-17]. Designing new and
possibly durable resistance requires knowledge of pathogenicity factors possessed by the four groups.
Many candidate pathogenicity factors have been identified in strains of Xanthomonas. A number of virulence
factors are employed by xanthomonads to gain entry
into leaf or fruit tissue, and gain access to nutrients,
while simultaneously overcoming or suppressing plant
defenses. Different secretion systems and their effectors
have been shown to contribute to the virulence of plant
pathogens. The type III secretion system (T3SS)
encoded by the hrp (Hypersensitive Response and
Pathogenicity) gene cluster [18,19] and type III secreted
effectors have been widely studied for their role in

hypersensitivity and pathogenicity. Effectors common
between strains are believed to be responsible for conserved virulence function and avoidance of host defense.
Differences in effector suites have evolved in closely
related strains of plant pathogens and strain-specific
effectors may help to escape recognition by host-specific
defenses [20-25]. Important insights into pathogenicity
mechanisms of X. euvesicatoria strain 85-10 (hereafter,
Xcv) have been obtained with its genome sequence [26].
Here we report draft genome sequences of type strains
of the other three bacterial spot pathogen species:
X. vesicatoria strain 1111 (Xv 1111) (ATCC 35937),
X. perforans strain 91-118 (Xp 91-118), and X. gardneri
strain 101 (Xg 101) (ATCC 19865). We have annotated
and analyzed predicted pathogenicity factors in the draft
genomes. Additionally, we have investigated differentiation between xanthomonads that might explain differences in disease phenotypes and in host range.

Results and Discussion
Draft genome sequences of Xv strain 1111, Xp strain 91118 and Xg strain 101 were obtained by combining
Roche-454 (pyrosequencing) and Illumina GA2 (Solexa)
sequencing data

Initially, we sequenced Xv strain 1111 (ATCC 35937)
(hereafter Xv), Xp strain 91-118 (hereafter Xp) and Xg
strain 101 (ATCC 19865) (hereafter Xg) by 454
pyrosequencing [27]. De novo assembly using Newbler
assembler resulted in 4181, 2360 and 4540 contigs,
respectively, for Xv, Xp and Xg, with approximately 10fold coverage for each strain (Additional file 1: Table
S1). Many pathogenicity genes, including type III effectors, existed in the form of fragments given the relatively
low coverage of the 454-based assembly. More complete
assemblies were obtained using Illumina sequencing
[28]. De novo assemblies of around 100-fold coverage
were constructed from the Illumina data alone or combined with pre-assembled 454 long reads using CLC
Genomic Workbench [29]. Combined 454 and Illumina
sequencing produced a much better assembly than
either technology alone (Table 1). Therefore, combined
assemblies were chosen for all subsequent analyses. The
average contig size in the combined 454 and Illumina
assemblies was around 18 kb for Xv and Xp, and 10 kb
for Xg. The N50 (minimum number of contigs needed
to cover 50% of the assembly) values were 37 and 40 for
Xv and Xp, respectively, and 83 for Xg indicating that
final assemblies consist of a few large contigs allowing
reasonably accurate whole genome comparisons.
The three strains were deduced to contain plasmids as
evidenced by the presence of genes that are known to
be involved in plasmid maintenance (e.g. parB/F genes).
We have used adjacency to such genes to infer occurrence of certain other genes on plasmids.

Relationships of the strains to other xanthomonads using
whole genome comparisons

16S rRNA analysis and MLST-based phylogenetic analysis showed the diversity among the four bacterial spot
species. We carried out phylogenetic analysis based on
orthologous protein-coding genes from draft genomes
and reference xanthomonads (Figure 1). Whole genome
comparisons were performed using the MUMi index
[30] to assess pairwise distance between the draft genomes and available reference Xanthomonas genomes as
shown in the phylogenetic tree and the distance matrix
(Additional file 2: Fig. S2). Another program, dnadiff,
based on nucmer [31] showed the extent of homologies
among the shared regions of the genomes by pairwise
comparisons (Additional file 3: Table S3). All of the
methods yielded consistent results: we were able to
ascertain that among the three newly sequenced strains
in relationship to the previously sequenced strains, Xp
and Xcv form the closest pair, which is in turn closest
to Xac. Next, Xg is closest to Xcc, with Xv forming a
clade with Xg and the Xcc species group (Figure 1,
Additional files S2 and S3).
Four xanthomonads show variation in the organization of
the type III secretion gene clusters

Annotation of the respective type III secretion gene clusters, or hrp genes showed that Xp has an almost identical
and syntenic hrp cluster to that of Xcv (Figure 2). The
most notable difference is that hpaG and hpaF encode
the fusion protein XopAE in Xp, while they are present
as separate genes in Xcv. Adjacent hypothetical protein
XCV0410 (126 amino acid protein) is absent from Xp. Xv
and Xg show greater similarity to the core hrp cluster
genes of Xcc than to that of Xcv. Xv and Xg contain
hrpW associated with the hrp cluster as in Xcc. Additionally, xopD in Xv and Xg is not associated with the hrp
cluster as in Xcc (referred to as psv in Xcc). PsvA shows
74% and 84% sequence identity to the respective homologs from Xv and Xg. XopA (hpa1) from Xcv seems to be
absent from Xv and Xg. Interestingly, we found a novel
candidate effector gene (named xopZ2) upstream of
hrpW in Xv and Xg (See below, Additional file 4: Fig. S4).

Concatenated amino acid sequences of the orthologous genes from
four bacterial spot pathogen strains along with other sequenced
xanthomonads were considered in the analysis. Stenotrophomonas
maltophilia (Sm) was used as an outgroup. The evolutionary history
was inferred using the Maximum likelihood method. The tree is
drawn to scale, with branch lengths corresponding to the
evolutionary distances. The evolutionary distances were computed
using the Maximum Composite Likelihood method and are in the
units of the number of base substitutions per site.

Figure 2 Comparison of type III secretion system cluster, its associated type III effector genes and helper genes of three draft
genomes with already sequenced xanthomonads. Type III secretion gene clusters in five strains are shown. Boxes of the same colour
indicate orthologous genes. Genes of special interest discussed in the paper are labeled. Xp has near identical hrp cluster as Xcv; Xv and Xg
contain mosaic hrp cluster with organization and gene content similar to Xcc, but associated effectors are similar to Xcv along with novel
effector gene associated with the cluster.

Finally, the hrp-associated effector xopF1 is conserved
and intact in all four tomato and pepper pathogens.
A reporter gene assay confirms translocation of novel
type III effectors

We identified and annotated T3SS effectors from the
three newly sequenced xanthomonads (See Methods).
Several candidate effectors, which had not yet been
experimentally confirmed in xanthomonads, and candidate effectors with plausible translocation motifs were
identified (Tables 2, 3, and 4). Corroborative evidence
for T3SS-mediated translocation of the candidate effectors was assessed by constructing fusion genes with the
C-terminal end of AvrBs2 coding sequence (avrBs262574aa) in a race 6 strain of X. euvesicatoria. Translocation was measured in pepper cv. ECW 20R, containing the resistance gene Bs2 (Additional file 4: Fig. S4).
Genes xopAO, xopG, xopAM, and XGA_0724

(belonging to the avrBs1 class of effectors), of which
homologs were previously found in Pseudomonas
species, were demonstrated to direct AvrBs2-specific
hypersensitive reactions in ECW 20R (Tables 3,
Table 4, Additional file 4: Fig. S4). Another candidate
effector gene xopZ2, associated with the hrp clusters in
Xv and Xg (Figure 2), was also functional in the
AvrBs2-based assay. Thus, we identified five effectors
(xopAO, xopG, xopAM, xopZ2, XGA_0724) that have
not been previously recognized in Xanthomonas and
showed their functionality.
Core effectors among four xanthomonads give insight
into infection strategies of the pathogen

Comparing the draft genome sequences of the three
xanthomonads with that of Xcv allowed us to identify
the core effectors conserved in all four strains as well as
strain-specific effectors (Tables 2, 3, and 4).

At least 11 effector genes form a core set of common
effectors for xanthomonads infecting tomato and pepper
(Table 2). Of these 11, eight effector genes (avrBs2,
xopK, xopL, xopN, xopQ, xopR, xopX and xopZ) were
found to be conserved in all sequenced xanthomonads
including the three draft genomes presented here with
the exceptions of X. albilineans and X. campestris pv.
armoraciae. These genes might be necessary for maintaining pathogenicity of these xanthomonads in a wide
range of host plants. XopN has been reported to suppress PAMP (pathogen-associated molecular pattern)triggered immunity by interacting with tomato TARK1
and TFT1 [32]. XopF1 is conserved in tomato and pepper xanthomonads. Although a homolog of xopF1 is
found in Xcc, the respective gene is truncated [34].
Hence, xopF1 is a potential pathogenicity determinant
in tomato. A xopF1 deletion mutant of Xcv did not
show any difference in virulence when compared to wild
type Xcv on the susceptible cultivar of pepper ECW,
suggesting XopF1 is not the lone factor for pathogenicity of Xcv on pepper [33]. Another effector gene, xopD,
is associated with the hrp gene cluster in Xcv and Xp.
However, xopD appears to have translocated to another

[46]

location in the genome in case of Xg, Xv and Xcc
strains. XopD is annotated as “Psv virulence protein” in
Xcc genome [34] and has been shown to be a chimeric
protein sharing a C terminus with XopD from Xcv [35].
Although xopD homologs from Xv and Xg are syntenic
with the psv gene in Xcc, Xv and Xg have intact fulllength copies of xopD as in Xcv, indicating that the
xopD could be another effector exclusive to the tomato
pathogens and a possible pathogenicity determinant in
tomato. XopD has been shown to enhance pathogen
survival in tomato leaves by delaying symptom development [36]. Two tandem copies of xopX are found in Xg.
However, one gene in Xg appears to be inactive due to a
frameshift mutation. In Xp, the two copies of xopX are
found in different locations in the genome with neighboring genes, including chaperone gene groEL, which is
also duplicated. Orthologs of xopZ are also found in all
four xanthomonads, with 82% identity for Xcv and Xp
and 35% identity for Xg and Xv. Apart from low
sequence identity in Xv and Xg, gene-specific rearrangements appear to have occurred within each ortholog.
We propose that the overall low amino acid relatedness
(pairwise sequence identities below 50%) of this effector

Potnis et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:146
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/146

in Xv and Xg warrants assigning the proteins to a new
family within the xopZ class, named xopZ2, while the
orthologs from Xcv and Xp belong to family of xopZ1 as
originally described in Xoo and as supported by pairwise
sequence identities of at least 60% (see above, Figure 2,
Table 4).
Effectors unique to Xp might be responsible for
restricting growth on pepper

Xp is pathogenic only on tomato. The avirulence gene,
avrXv3, present in Xp, was previously shown to elicit an
hypersensitive response (HR) in pepper cv. ECW [37].
An avrXv3 knockout mutant of Xp is not virulent in
pepper cv. ECW indicating that other factors are associated with host specificity. Comparing effector repertoires of the pepper pathogens Xg, Xcv, and Xv with Xp
may provide clues to the factors that are responsible for
reduced virulence (Table 4). Besides avrXv3, the only
effectors present in Xp and absent or inactive in Xg, Xv
and Xcv are xopC2, xopAE and xopJ4 (avrXv4) (Table
3). The gene avrXv4 is absent from other sequenced
xanthomonads and shows gene-for-gene interaction
with the Xv4 resistance gene from the wild tomato relative Solanum pennellii but does not contribute to
restricted growth of Xp on pepper [38]. The effector
xopC2 is a homolog of the effector rsp1239 from Ralstonia solanacearum GMI1000 and xopAE encodes an LRR
protein with homology to the R. solanacearum effector
PopC. Both genes, xopC2 and xopAE, are truncated in
Xcv. Therefore, these two effectors may trigger immunity in pepper. Interestingly, Xp contains a paralog of
xopP. The two copies are found next to each other in
the genome and share 75% identity at the amino acid
level. The second copy is next to the candidate effector
xopC2, which is unique to Xp among tomato and pepper pathogens. Effectors xopC2 and xopP may both act
to restrict growth in pepper. Moreover, there are at least
two effectors, xopE2 and xopG, present in the pepper
pathogens Xcv, Xv and Xg but absent from Xp. These
effectors may be essential pathogenicity factors in
pepper.
Species-specific effectors

Xv possesses two unique effector genes, xopAG (avrGf1)
and xopAI (Table 3). A phylogenetic analysis of xopAG
showed that xopAG from Xv is closely related to xopAG
from X. citri Aw, which has been shown to be responsible
for causing an HR on grapefruit [39]. XopAI is a chimeric
protein, which contains a conserved myristoylation motif
at its N terminus, like XopJ1. This effector class also
includes the homolog XAC3230 from Xac as well as
XAUB_26830 and XAUC_23780 from X. fuscans subsp.
aurantifolii strains B and C, respectively [25]. The presence of transposons and phage elements in close

Page 7 of 23

proximity helps to explain the evolution of this novel
effector in Xac by terminal reassortment [35]. Xv also
contains effector gene avrBsT, which is responsible for
the hypersensitive response on pepper. Loss of the plasmid containing avrBsT in Xcv strain 75-3 allows the
strain to cause disease on pepper [40].
Xg contains at least two effectors, avrHah1 (an
avrBs3-like effector gene) and xopB as does Xcv, and
share sequence identity of 82% and 86% respectively to
the corresponding effectors of Xcv. However, AvrHah1
appears to specify a different phenotype when compared
to avrBs3 from Xcv. AvrHah1 was shown to be responsible for increased watersoaking on pepper ECW-50R and
60R, whereas Xcv strains carrying avrBs3 show a phenotype that consists of small raised fleck lesions on pepper
[41]. Another effector gene, xopB, has a PIP box at the
5’ end in Xcv, whereas the homolog in Xg does not contain a PIP box. Neighboring genes to xopB in the
respective strains are completely different between genomes, suggesting lack of synteny between the two species in this region (Table 4). XopB from Xg is 92%
identical at the amino acid level to the homolog in Xcv.
Deletion mutants of xopB from Xcv did not show any
difference in virulence, indicating it does not contribute
significantly to virulence [42]. However, xopB may contribute to virulence in Xg. We also identified eight effector genes that are unique to Xcv (Table 3). With the
exception of xopAA (early chlorosis factor), all of these
genes belong to regions of low GC content compared to
average genome GC content (64.75%): avrBs1 (42%),
xopC1 (48%), xopJ1 (xopJ) (57%), xopJ3 (avrRxv) (52%),
xopO (52%), xopAJ (avrRxo1) (51%).
Few effectors are shared among phylogenetically related
group strains

Although Xp and Xcv, and Xv and Xg form distinct phylogenetic groups (Figure 1), relatively few effectors are
shared between these species. For Xp and Xcv, they
share at least six effectors - xopE1, xopF2, xopP, xopV,
xopAK, xopAP, which are absent from the other two
genomes (Table 4). Xv and Xg appear to be most closely
related to strains of X. campestris pv. campestris, and
this relationship is reflected in the suite of effector
genes. In fact, Xg and Xv share four effector genes with
Xcc, namely, xopAM, avrXccA1, hrpW and xopZ2, with
the caveat that hrpW and avrXccA1 may not function as
intracellular effectors (Table 4). Furthermore, the genomic regions containing these genes are syntenic in Xg,
Xv and Xcc.
X. gardneri shows evidence of effector acquisition by
horizontal gene transfer

Effector homologs of avrA, hopAS1 and avrRpm1 from
P. syringae pv. tomato T1 and P. syringae pv. syringae

Potnis et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:146

B728a are found in Xg with 79%, 41% and 61% identity
at the amino acid level, respectively (Table 3, Additional
file 4: Fig. S4). Other X. gardneri strains also contain
these effectors based on PCR screening (data not
shown). These three effectors, XGA_0724 (belonging to
avrBs1 class), XGA_0764/XGA_0765 (xopAS) and
XGA_1250 (xopAO), are unique to X. gardneri. The C
terminal region of XGA_0724 shows 53% identity to
avrBs1 from Xcv. Hence according to the Xanthomonas
effector nomenclature [24], XGA_0724 from Xg was
placed under the class avrBs1. XGA_0764/XGA_0765
and XGA_1250 have not yet been reported to be found
in xanthomonads and were assigned to new classes
xopAS and xopAO. X. gardneri strains have been found
to be associated with tomato and have a lower optimum
temperature for disease development similar to that of
pathovars of Pseudomonas syringae [43]. A high score
by Alien_hunter analysis [44], along with very low GC
content (45% for XGA_0724 and 48% for XGA_01250,
59% for XGA_0764/XGA_0765) and the proximity of
mobile genetic elements provides evidence for horizontal gene transfer (Additional file 5: Table S5). Effector
xopAS appears to be separated into two ORFs
XGA_0764 and XGA_0765 by internal stop codon. The
functionality of effector xopAS needs to be confirmed by
in planta reporter gene assay. AvrA of P. syringae pv.
tomato PT23 was shown to contribute to virulence on
tomato plants [45]. Acquisition of XGA_0724 by Xg
might have conferred increased virulence on tomato.
AvrRpm1 from P. syringae pv. syringae possesses a myristoylation motif, which is absent from homologs in Xg.
This modification in Xg might have been acquired to
escape host recognition. Another candidate effector
gene, xopAQ, in Xg is found 68 bps downstream of a
perfect PIP box. The gene shows 65% identity at the
amino acid level to rip6/11, a novel effector from
R. solanacearum RS1000 [46].
All four xanthomonads contain Ax21 coding gene but
only Xcv contains a functional sulfation gene

The ax21 (activator of XA21-mediated immunity) gene
is conserved among Xanthomonas species and is predicted to encode a type I-secreted protein that may
serve as a quorum sensing signaling molecule [47]. A
17-amino acid sulfated peptide from the N-terminal
region of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) Ax21
(axY S 22) was shown to bind and activate the XA21
receptor kinase from rice, demonstrating that Ax21 is a
conserved PAMP that can activate plant immune signaling [48]. The ax21 gene is present in Xcv (93% identity
with Xoo PXO99 protein), Xp (94%), Xv (91%), and Xg
(88%). The axYS22 peptide is 100% conserved in Xcv, Xp
and Xv, while in Xg there is a change from leucine to
isoleucine at residue 20; this is unlikely to alter the

Page 8 of 23

activity of the peptide, since changing this residue to
alanine had no effect on recognition by XA21 [48].
Recognition of axYS22 by the XA21 receptor requires
sulfation of tyrosine 22, which requires the putative sulfotransferase RaxST. In contrast to ax21, the raxST
gene is more variable in these genomes, which is consistent with a report of sequence differences in this gene
among Xoo strains [49]. Furthermore, in Xp, there is a
single-nucleotide insertion at position 65, causing a frameshift mutation. The Xv and Xg genomes do not contain raxST; therefore, the ax21 gene products may be
nonfunctional in these strains. These findings have
implications for the further study of the role of Ax21 in
quorum sensing and virulence, as well as for the usefulness of the XA21 receptor to confer resistance to
xanthomonads in crop plants.
Two type II secretion systems are conserved in all four
Xanthomonas genomes

Most cell-wall degrading enzymes, such as cellulases,
polygalacturonases, xylanases, and proteases, are
secreted by a type II secretion system (T2SS). The Xps
T2SS, present in all xanthomonads, has been studied for
its contribution to virulence in Xcc and Xoo [50,51].
Another T2SS cluster, known as the Xcs system, is
found only in certain species of Xanthomonas, e.g. Xcc,
Xac, and Xcv. The Xps system secretes xylanases and
proteases and is under control of hrpG and hrpX [52],
indicating differential regulation. Both Xps and Xcs systems are present in all three draft genomes.
Xanthomonads possess diverse repertoires of cell-wall
degrading enzymes, which are present in diverse
genomic arrangement patterns

Each species of Xanthomonas has its own collection of
genes encoding endoxylanases, endoglucanases, and pectate lyases which contribute to cell wall deconstruction
during pathogenesis. We have compared these repertoires from the three draft genomes and other xanthomonads as detailed in Table 5. The genes are designated
for different families of glycosyl hydrolases (GH) and
polysaccharide lyases (PL) that include the enzymes that
cleave glycosidic bonds in the structural polysaccharides
of plant cell walls.
Genes encoding secreted endoxylanases regulated by
the xps genes have been described for their contributions to virulence, including XCV0965 [52] encoding
GH30 endoxyalanase. The GH30 family catalyses the
cleavage of methylglucuronoxylans in the cell walls of
monocots and dicots at a b-1,4-xylosidic bond penultimate to one linking the xylose residue that is substituted
by an a-1,2-linked 4-O-methylglucuronate residue
[53,54]. Such an enzyme secreted by Erwinia chrysanthemi generates oligosaccharides that are not

Different cell wall degrading enzymes, such as xylanase, pectate lyase, glucanases, were compared for their repertoires among already sequenced xanthomonads
including our draft genomes. Genes identified by their locus tags in the respective genomes.

assimilated for growth, suggesting a function in which it
contributes to cell wall deconstruction for access to pectates for growth substrate [53]. It is interesting to note
the orthologous genes encoding GH30 enzymes are
absent in Xg and Xv, with a truncated xyn30 gene in
Xac. On the basis of sequence homology, xyn30 genes
may also contribute to virulence in Xoo, Xcc and Xp.
The more common GH10 endoxylanases, which occur
in several bacterial and fungal phyla, have been implicated
in the virulence of plant pathogenic bacteria and fungi
[55,56]. In Xoo, deletion of the gene encoding a GH10
xyn10B resulted in diminished virulence [57]. All
sequenced Xanthomonas genomes contain either two or
three copies of xyn10 genes, all of which are within a gene
cluster that may comprise a single operon (Figure 3). The
GH10 endoxylanases are the best studied of all of the xylanases, and structure/function relationships may be inferred
on the basis of gene sequence. The action of these
enzymes on glucuronoxylans generates xylotriose, xylobiose, and small amounts of xylose that generally serve as
substrates for growth. Also generated is methylglucuronoxylotriose, that is formed to the extent that xylose

residues in the b-1,4 xylan backbone are substituted with
a-1,2-linked 4-O-methylglucuronate residues [58].
An adjacent gene cluster in an opposite orientation
contains agu67 gene encoding a GH67 a-glucuronidase
that serves to catayze the removal of 4-O-methylglucuronate from the reducing terminus of methylglucuronoxylotriose. This activity provides a synergistic function to
the overall xylanolytic process to generate xylotriose,
which is converted to xylose by xylanases and xylosidases for complete metabolism [59]. The coregulation of
operons encoding XynB and Agu67 enzymes occurs as a
logical condition to coordinate expression of genes that
encode these and additional enzymes that collectively
process glucuronxylans and glucuronoarabinoxylans for
complete metabolism. The accessory enzymes and transporters necessary for the function of these enzymes are
embedded within these operons in Gram positive bacteria [60-62] and share similarities noted here with
Xanthomonas spp.. These include the genes encoding
two glycohydrolases, a b-xylosidase and an a-L-arabinofuranosidase. Also included in this cluster are genes
encoding enzymes for intracellular metabolism of

Potnis et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:146
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/146

glucuronate and xylose, including glucuronate isomerase; xylulose isomerase; D-mannonate dehydratase; and
D-mannonate oxidoreductase. Genes encoding mannitol
dehydrogenase and the hexuronate transporter, as well
as the TonB-dependent receptor and LacI transcriptional regulator, flank these two operons.
The arrangement and content of xylanolytic enzymes
differentiate Xanthomonas species into three groups
(Figure 3). Here, we propose a common nomenclature for
xylanases, the genes for which have been annotated in the
sequenced genomes. Members of the first group are Xac,
Xcv and Xp in which all three genes encoding GH10
endoxylanases (xyn10A, xyn10B and xyn10C) are present,
and with additional genes further downstream in this cluster. Members of the second group are Xcc, Xv and Xg in
which genes encoding two of the three endoxylanases are
present (xyn10A and xyn10C) and where one or more of
the the downstream genes are absent. Xoo strains represent a third group in which a different set of two endoxylanase encoding genes are present (xyn10A and xyn10B)

Page 10 of 23

and where the b-galactosidase and gluconolactonase genes
flanking xyn10C are absent. It is noteworthy that the organization of genes in the cluster encoding the a-glucuronidase is conserved across Xanthomonas species.
Genes involved in several Type IV secretion systems are
present in genomes and plasmids

Like Xcv, the tomato pathogens, Xg, Xv and Xp, also
appear to contain more than one copy of a type IV
secretion system (T4SS) cluster (Figure 4A, B). Two
T4SS clusters (Vir and Dot/Icm type) are present in
Xcv, and genes belonging to both of these systems are
found on plasmids [26]. The Dot/Icm type system is
absent from Xv, Xp and Xg.
In Xv and Xp, genes for one T4SS are on a plasmid
and the second one on the chromosome while in Xg,
two T4SS gene clusters are on a plasmid and one is on
the chromosome. The two T4SS clusters on plasmids of
Xg do not show any similarity to the genes for T4SS in
Xac, Xcv, Xcc and Xoo. Of the two T4SS clusters in Xg,

containing three endoxylanase genes xyn10A, xyn10B and xyn10C; B) Found in Xcc, Xv and Xg containing two endoxylanases xyn10A and xyn10C;
and C) Found in Xoo containing xyn10A and xyn10B within endoxylanase operon.

one is also found in Xv and Xp. This cluster appears to
be exclusive to these three tomato pathogens (Figure
4A). The genes belonging to this cluster show low (3045%) identity to the T4SS clusters from Ralstonia, Burkholderia, Bradyrhizobium, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The other cluster from Xg, which is absent
from Xv and Xp, shows very high identity (98%) and
synteny to the T4SS cluster of Burkholderia multivorans
and around 89% identity to a T4SS cluster of Acidovorax avenae subsp. citrulli (Figure 4B).
Apart from the plasmid borne T4SS genes, Xcv also
contains a portion of a type IV system cluster on the
chromosome and consists of VirB6, VirB8, VirB9, VirD4
genes. This chromosomal cluster is flanked by a transposon element (IS1477) that might indicate its horizontal
gene transfer. Xp, Xg and Xv genomes contain a complete
chromosomal T4SS cluster showing high identity to the
T4SS chromosomal clusters from Xcc (Figure 4C).

Type V secreted adhesins function in synergism during
pathogenesis

Different adhesins have been shown to function at different stages of the infection process starting with
attachment, entry, later survival inside host tissue and
colonization by promoting virulence [63,64]. FhaB
hemagglutinin, important for leaf attachment, survival
inside plant tissue and biofilm formation, is present in
all four tomato pathogens. In Xcv, fhaB is divided into
two separate open reading frames, XCV1860 and
XCV1861, with the two-partner secretion domains being
present in XCV1860. Sequence alignment indicates that
fhaB is possibly inactivated in Xcv by the internal stop
codon that separates XCV1860 from XCV1861. In the
case of Xoo PXO99A, the Xanthomonas adhesin-like
proteins XadA and XadB promote virulence by enhancing colonization of the leaf surface and leaf entry
through hydathode [64]. As in Xcv and Xac, Xp encodes

Potnis et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:146
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/146

Page 12 of 23

two copies of xadA, while Xv and Xg possess a single
ortholog of xadA as does Xcc. YapH and the type IV
pilus protein PilQ were shown to be involved in virulence in Xoo during later stages of growth and migration
in xylem vessels. In Xcv, Xc, and XooKACC, two copies
of yapH are present. There are two pilQ orthologs in
Xcv and only one in other sequenced xanthomonads.
Next to the fhaB and fhaC adhesin genes, hms operon is
present in the genomes of xanthomonads, the homologs
of which are pga operon genes in E. coli involved in biofilm formation [65].
Type VI secretion system is present in Xcv, Xv and Xp

Type VI secretion system (T6SS) has been shown
recently to contribute to host pathogen interactions during pathogenesis in Vibrio cholerae, Burkholderia pseudomallei and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Hcp
(Haemolysin-coregulated protein) and Vgr (valine-glycine repeats) proteins are exported by the T6SS [66].
T6SS clusters can be assigned to three different types in
xanthomonads (Table 6). Xcv and Xp possess two types
of T6SSs (type 1 and 3); whereas Xv contains only a single type of T6SS, type 3. As in Xcc, there is no T6SS
cluster in Xg (Table 6, Additional file 6: Table S6).
LPS locus displays remarkable variation in sequence and
number of coding genes and shows host specific
variation

The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis cluster has
been studied in detail in Xcc [67], which comprises
three regions; region 1 from wxcA to wxcE involved in

biosynthesis of water soluble LPS antigen; region 2
(gmd, rmd) coding for LPS core genes; and region 3
from wxcK to wxcO coding for enzymes for modification
of nucleotide sugars and sugar translocation systems.
This LPS biosynthesis locus is positioned between highly
conserved housekeeping genes, namely cystathionine
gamma lyase (metB) and electron transport flavoprotein
(etfA), as reported in other xanthomonads [68]. Comparison of this cluster from draft genomes to the already
sequenced xanthomonads revealed high variability in the
number of genes and their sequences. Xv and Xg have
an identical type of LPS gene cluster of 17.7 kb encoding 14 open reading frames (Figure 5A) which is similar
in organization and sequence identity to the LPS locus
from Xcc strains. Interestingly, Xg and Xv also contain
two glycosyl transferases involved in synthesis of xylosylated polyrhamnan as seen in Xcc [69], in contrast to
glycosyl transferases (wbdA1, wbdA2) involved in synthesis of polymannan in Xcv [26]. This suggests that basic
structure of O-antigen in Xg and Xv is similar to Xcc.
The three tomato/pepper pathogens Xcv, Xv and Xg
have retained an ancestral type of LPS gene cluster
(Figure 5A and 5B). On the other hand, Xp has acquired
a novel LPS gene cluster during the course of evolution
and is completely different in sequence and number of
genes that are encoded. In Xp, this LPS locus is 17.3 kb
long and encodes 12 ORFs, all of which are absent in
the corresponding genomic region of Xcv, Xv or Xg.
Also the first five ORFs flanking the metB side of the
LPS locus in Xp (Figure 5A, ORFs colored in red)
showed very low or no identity to region 1 of the LPS

locus in the other xanthomonads. However, these ORFs
still belong to the same Pfam families [70] that are
usually present in this region, for example, ABC transporters and glycosyl transferases. The second half of the
LPS cluster flanking etfA side encodes six ORFs, which
are homologs of the LPS cluster genes from Xac, Xcm
and Xoo. Phylogenetic insight based on conserved metB
and etfA genes that flank the LPS locus suggest that the
ancestor of all the Xanthomonas pathogens of pepper
and tomato studied in this paper had the same LPS gene
cluster, however putative horizontal gene transfer events
at this locus have led to the acquisition of a novel LPS
gene cluster in Xp (Figure 5B). Alien_hunter analysis also
supports this acquisition with a high score showing this
region to belong to an anomalous region (Additional file
5: Table S5). This event might have played a major role
in changing the specificity of Xp towards tomato and its
dominance over its relative(s) as reported previously [71],
similar to variant epidemic strain of Vibrio cholerae,
reported to be a major reason for its emergence and cholera outbreak during the 1990’s in the Indian subcontinent [72]. Identity in terms of sequences and gene
organization among pepper pathogens and absence of
those genes from X. perforans and a novel LPS cluster in
the tomato pathogen X. perforans suggest a role of this
cluster in host specific variation.
Analysis of DSF cell-cell signaling system

RpfC/RpfG are two-component signaling factors and are
involved in DSF (diffusible signal factor) cell-cell signaling [73-76], known to co-ordinate virulence and biofilm
gene expression. The genomes of Xv, Xp, and Xg carry an
rpf (regulation of pathogenicity factors) gene cluster

(Table 7) that is found in all xanthomonads and which
encodes components governing the synthesis and perception of the signal molecule DSF [74,75]. The Rpf of the
DSF system regulates the synthesis of virulence factors
and biofilm formation and is required for the full virulence of Xcc, Xac, Xoc, and Xoo [77-81]. RpfF is responsible for the synthesis of DSF, whereas, RpfC and RpfG are
implicated in DSF perception and signal transduction
[73-76]. RpfC is a complex sensor kinase, whereas RpfG
is a response regulator with a CheY-like receiver domain
that is attached to an HD-GYP domain. HD-GYP
domains act in degradation of the second messenger cyclic di-GMP [82]. In addition to genes encoding these products, Xg and Xp have rpfH, which encodes a membrane
protein related to the sensory input domain RpfC but
whose function is unknown. Xv contains rpfH but with
an internal stop codon, whereas functional rpfH is present in Xcv and Xcc, and totally absent in Xac and Xoo.
Cyclic di-GMP signaling

Cyclic di-GMP is a second messenger known to regulate a range of functions in diverse bacteria, including
the virulence of animal and plant pathogens [83-85].

The cellular level of cyclic di-GMP is controlled by a
balance between synthesis by GGDEF domain diguanylate cyclases and degradation by HD-GYP or EAL
domain phosphodiesterases. GGDEF, EAL and HDGYP domains are largely found in combination with
other signaling domains, suggesting that their activities
in cyclic di-GMP turnover can be modulated by environmental cues. A number of proteins involved in cyclic di-GMP signaling have been implicated in virulence
of Xcc [86,87]. The genome of Xcv encodes 3 proteins
with an HD-GYP domain and 33 proteins with
GGDEF and/or EAL domains. As in other Xanthomonas spp., the HD-GYP domain proteins are completely
conserved in Xcv, Xv, Xg and Xp. There is also almost
complete conservation of GGDEF/EAL domain proteins between Xcv and three draft genomes, although
Xv has no ortholog of XCV1982 (Additional file 7:
Table S7). In addition, the EAL domain protein
(XCVd0150) encoded on a plasmid in Xcv is absent in
the other strains.
Copper resistance (cop) genes are present in Xv and
copper homeostasis (coh) genes are present in all
strains

Among the Xcv, Xv, Xp and Xg strains sequenced, Xv
is the only one resistant to copper and the only strain
harboring a set of plasmid borne genes, namely copL,
copA, copB, copM, copG, copC, copD, and copF that are
also present in copper resistant strains of Xac (unpublished data/Behlau, F. personal communication) and S.
maltophilia [88]. Genes copA and copB have been previously annotated as copper resistance related genes
for many different xanthomonad genomes including
Xoo, Xoc, Xcv, Xac and Xcc. Homologs of these genes
are also present in Xv, Xg and Xp and are located on
the chromosome. Additionally, upstream of copA on
the chromosome of all strains, there is an ORF that
shares homology with plasmid copL. In contrast to
what has been published, chromosomal copA and copB
are not responsible for copper resistance but likely for
copper homeostasis and/or tolerance. While strains
harboring the plasmid-borne cop genes, like in Xv, are
resistant to copper and can grow on MGY agar (manitol-glutamate yeast agar) amended with up to 400 mg
L -1 of copper sulfate pentahydrate, strains that have
only the chromosomal cop genes as for Xcv, Xp and
Xg, are sensitive to copper and can only grow on
media amended up to 75 mg L-1 of copper. Nucleotide
sequence of plasmid cop genes in Xv are 98% similar
to the ones found in Xac and Stenotrophomonas,
whereas chromosomal copLAB from Xv is 83% identical to homolog ORFs in Xcv, Xg and Xp. When copL,
copA and copB genes from Xv located on the plasmid
are compared to the homologs on the chromosome of

Page 14 of 23

the same strain, the identity of nucleotide sequences is
27, 73, and 65%, respectively. To avoid further confusion or misinterpretation, we suggest that the nomenclature of the chromosomal copL, copA and copB genes
in xanthomonads should be changed to cohL, cohA and
cohB, respectively, referring to copper homeostasis
genes. New nomenclature has been adopted in the
annotation of the draft genomes.
Genes unique to X. perforans as compared to pepper
pathogens give clues to its predominance over Xcv in the
field and host specificity

Thirteen gene clusters were found to be specific to the
tomato pathogen Xp when compared to the other three
strains (Additional file 8: Table S8). A part of the clusters are syntenic to the genomic regions specific to the
three pepper pathogens, suggesting the replacement of
these genomic regions from pepper pathogens in correspond to these region in Xp. These replaced regions in
Xp might provide potential candidates for host range
determinants. Most notable among these regions was
the LPS cluster genes (See above). Other such regions
include the avirulence genes avrXv3 and avrXv4, a TIRlike domain containing protein, oxidoreductases, and
bacteriocin-like proteins that were not found in any
other sequenced xanthomonads. Importance of bacteriocin-like genes in Xp has already been studied for its predominance in the field over T1 strains [89,90].
Alien_hunter analysis showed that the bacteriocin BCNA region belongs to an anomalous region indicating
possible horizontal gene transfer of this region (Additional file 5: Table S5).
Pepper pathogenicity/aggressiveness factors increased in
planta growth of Xp

Comparison of proteomes of Xv, Xg, Xcv against Xp
showed 68 genes exclusive to pepper pathogens which
might be candidate virulence factors on pepper (Additional file 9: Table S9). These include 16 genes with
known function, 35 coding for mobile genetic elements,
and 17 genes with unknown function/hypothetical proteins. Out of the 16 genes with known function, xopG
was confirmed to be a type III effector using the avrBs2
reporter gene assay and 6 genes belong to the LPS biosynthesis gene cluster. These 16 genes were searched
against already sequenced genomes of Xac, Xcc and Xoo.
The wxcO gene, which codes for O-antigen, has been
identified to be a virulence factor in the X. fuscans bean pathosystem by subtractive hybridization [91].
Three genes, XCV1298, XCV1839 and wxcO, were initially selected for the verification of their contribution to
virulence in pepper. Individual genes along with their
promoter regions were cloned into pLAFR3 and conjugated individually and in combination into X. perforans

Potnis et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:146
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/146

ME24 (91-118ΔavrXv3), which no longer elicits an HR
in pepper. However, in planta growth of ME24 is more
similar to that of an avirulent strain than the virulent
pepper strain TED3 race 6. ME24 transconjugants carrying wxcO and XCV1839 in combination showed
increased in planta growth and also comparatively
increased number of lesions on pepper cv. ECW when
compared to ME24 revealing that these two genes play
in fact a role in pepper pathogenicity (Figure 6).
Genes specific to Xg as compared to other tomato/
pepper pathogens may explain its aggressive nature on
tomato and pepper

Comparison of genes from Xg against Xcv, Xp and Xv genes
showed the presence of 625 genes specific to Xg (Additional
file 10: Table S10). These include four type III effectors
(avrBs1 member, xopAO, avrHah1, xopAQ), twenty-one
genes belonging to the unique type IV secretion system cluster and associated genes. These genes can be speculated to
contribute to the aggressive nature of Xg strains on tomato
and pepper. Xg also contains a unique beta xylosidase not
present in any other xanthomonads. Type II secreted beta
xylosidase has been studied for its role in plant cell wall
digestion. Moreover, Xg contains XGA_3730 coding for a
hemolysin-type calcium-binding repeat containing protein, a
homolog of which is found in Xylella strains with 55%
sequence identity. In Xylella, this gene is annotated as a
member of a family of pore forming toxins/RTX toxins. Its
homolog is also found in other plant pathogens (i.e. P. syringae pv. syringae B728a and R. solanacearum GMI1000).
This protein has been described as a type I effector in X. fastidiosa strain temecula (PD1506) [92]. RTX toxin family
members, especially of the hemolysin type, have been shown
to be virulence factors in a variety of cell types in eukaryotes
[93,94]. Finally, a gene XGA_0603 coding for lanthionine

Page 15 of 23

synthetase (lantibiotic biosynthesis) is found among these Xg
specific genes, a homolog of which is found in Xvm
NCPPB702. LanL enzymes in pathogenic bacteria contribute
to virulence by modifying the host signaling pathways, in
most cases by inactivating MAPKs [95].
Genes common to all tomato pathogens but absent from
other sequenced xanthomonads

In order to see what defines the tomato pathogens, we
compared the four sequenced genomes (Xv, Xp, Xg
and Xcv) to other sequenced xanthomonads. We found
seven genes that were conserved in all four tomato
pathogens and absent from most of other sequenced
xanthomonads with the exception of Xcm, Xvv, Xaub
and Xauc, which possess homologs for six out of these
seven genes (Table 8). Only the hypothetical protein
XCV2641 seems to be specific to the four tomato
pathogens. This gene shows only 35% sequence identity to a gene from Xvv and Xcm. A homolog of the
hypothetical protein, XCV4416 was found in Xau, but
is absent from all other sequenced xanthomonads.
Genes homologous in Xcm and Xvv include two transposase genes both belonging to the transposase 17
superfamily (XCV0615, XCV0623), XCV0041 (putative
penicillin amidase fragment), XCV0111 (lignostilbenealpha, beta dioxygenase), XCV0112 (uncharacterized
protein conserved in bacteria) (Table 8). Interestingly,
XCV0111 encodes a protein known to be involved in
phenylpropanoid degradation. Phenylpropanoids are
well known plant secondary metabolites induced during defense response upon pathogen attack [96]. It
appears that the four tomato pathogens along with Xvv
and Xcm have acquired this function to disarm the
basal plant defense.
The evolution of pathogenicity clusters corresponds to
the MLST-based phylogeny

The correlation between tree topology using MLST and
phylogeny based on the sequences of pathogenicity clusters and the avrBs2 effector gene, which is found in all
xanthomonads, was tested. Based on MLST, Xp and Xcv
group together along with Xac while Xg is more closely
related to Xcc. Xv forms a different clade and is more
closely related to the Xcc group. As can be seen in
Figure 7, phylogeny based on MLST is congruent with
phylogeny based on the pathogenicity clusters (gum, hrp
cluster) and based on the avrBs2 effector, suggesting
that overall these clusters were vertically inherited from
the most recent common ancestor of these strains.

Conclusions
The interaction of Xanthomonas strains with tomato and
pepper represents a model system for studying plantpathogen co-evolution because of the diversity present

among the strains causing bacterial spot. Although the
four Xanthomonas species infect the same host, tomato,
and cause very similar disease, they are genetically diverse
pathogens. The comparative genomic analysis has provided insights into the evolution of these strains. Whole
genome comparisons revealed that Xg and Xv are more

closely related to Xcc than Xcv and Xp. A few pathogenicity clusters, such as hrp, xcs and xps of Xg and Xv, were
similar in terms of genetic organization and sequence
identity to Xcc (Figure 8). However, a few pathogenicity
clusters of the four strains belonging to four phylogenetic
groups showed different evolutionary origins. While the

substitutions per site. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted in MEGA4.

pepper pathogens Xcv, Xv and Xg possess similar LPS
biosynthesis cluster, part of the LPS cluster from Xp is
similar to the one from Xac (Figure 8). Xv contains few
effectors, including xopAG (avrGf1) and xopAI the latter
of which was previously found to be unique to citrus
pathogens Xac, Xaub and Xauc [25]. Xg has a number of
effectors homologous to P. syringae type III effectors suggesting probable horizontal transfer of these effectors. Xg
contains a unique T4SS along with the one that is exclusive to Xp, Xv and Xg. Xp has two T6SSs, as found in
Xcv. Xv has only one T6SS which is similar to that of
Xac. Xg has no T6SS as seen for Xcc (Figure 8). While Xg
and Xv show close relationship to Xcc based on whole
genome comparisons, few pathogenicity clusters mentioned above seem to be conserved among tomato/pepper xanthomonads.
Type III effectors have been investigated for their contribution to pathogenicity and host-range specificity. In
addition to homologs of the known effectors, we identified novel effectors in the draft genomes. By comparing
effector repertoires of tomato pathogens, two possible

Page 17 of 23

candidate pathogenicity determinants, xopF1 and xopD,
were identified, of which xopD is responsible for delaying symptom development, and in turn, is important for
pathogen survival. Unique genes present in Xg include
the novel effectors xopAO, xopAQ, xopAS and an avrBs1
member as well as a few other virulence factors, which
have been characterized in other plant pathogens and
which could explain the aggressive nature of Xg on pepper. Each species contains at least three unique type III
effectors, which could explain host preferences among
the strains and their aggressiveness on tomato/pepper.
Comparison of the LPS clusters between the four species revealed significant variation. Xp has acquired a
novel LPS cluster during evolution, which might be
responsible for its predominance and its limited host
range. As seen from the in planta growth assay of Xp
ΔavrXv3 mutant carrying the LPS O-antigen from Xcv,
the LPS cluster from pepper pathogens can be a contributor to the increased in planta growth of Xp ΔavrXv3
mutant on pepper, but is not the absolute virulence
determinant. Use of the XA21 receptor similar to the

compared to the reference are indicated by faded gray shades. Reference strain is indicated by asterisk next to the symbol. The absence of
certain part of cluster is indicated by white. In the case of LPS cluster, Xv and Xac contain novel cluster regions in the C terminal region which is
indicated by a different color. Xac and Xcv contain a plasmid borne type IV cluster. Although it differs from type IVA present in other bacterial
spot xanthomonads, Xac and Xcv cluster is mentioned here under type IVA with different colors. A blank space indicates complete absence of
gene cluster in that particular species. A more detailed representation of individual clusters can be found in figures 2 through 5.

Xoo-rice system in Xcv - tomato/pepper could be one of
the ways to confer resistance to xanthomonads due to
presence of a similar AX21 peptide and a functional rax
system in Xcv. Common and unique genes encoding
enzymes involved in cell wall deconstruction are candidates for further study to define host preference and
virulence.
In conclusion, comparison of draft genomes obtained
by next generation sequencing has allowed an in-depth
study of diverse groups of bacterial spot pathogens at
the genomic level. This analysis will serve as a basis to
infer evolution of new virulent strains and overcoming
existing host resistance. The knowledge of potential
virulence or pathogenicity factors is expected to aid in
devising effective control strategies and breeding for
durable resistance in tomato and pepper cultivars.

Methods
Genome sequencing

Xv, Xp and Xg were sequenced by 454-pyrosequencing
[27] at core DNA sequencing facility, ICBR, University
of Florida. Xanthomonas isolates were grown overnight
in nutrient broth. Genomic DNA was isolated using
CTAB-NaCl extraction method [97] and resuspended in
TE buffer (10 mM Tris pH 8, 1 mM EDTA pH 8).
Libraries of fragmented genomics DNA were sequenced
on 454-Genome Sequencer, FLX instrument at Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (ICBR) at
UF. De novo assemblies were constructed using 454
Newbler Assembler [27]. The three draft genomes were
obtained with around 10× coverage.
For Illumina sequencing, the Xanthomonas strains
were purified from single-colony and grown overnight
in liquid cultures. Genomic DNA was isolated by phenol
extraction and precipitated twice with isopropanol, and
finally dissolved in TE buffer. DNA was then purified by
cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation and precipitated with 95% ethanol, then dissolved in TE buffer.
Libraries of fragmented genomic DNA with adapters for
paired-end sequencing were prepared according to the
protocol provided by Illumina, Inc. with minor modifications. The libraries were sequenced on the 2G Genome Analyzer at Center of Genome Research &
Biocomputing at Oregon State University and post-processed using a standard Illumina pipeline [28]. We
obtained approximately 8-10 million 60-bp reads for
each genome, providing roughly 95× predicted coverage.
Assembly and annotation

De novo assembly was generated on Newbler assembler
(version 2.3; 454 Life Science, Branford, CT) using 454sequencing reads for each genome. CLC workbench [29]
was used in the next step for combining 454-based contigs with illumina reads, wherein, 454 based contigs

Page 18 of 23

were used as long reads to fill in gaps generated during
combined de novo assembly. These combined assemblies
of each genome were uploaded on IMG-JGI (Joint Genome Institute, Walnut Creek, California) server for gene
calling. The gene prediction was carried out using GeneMark. Pfam, InterPro, COGs assignments were carried
out for identified genes. Pathogenicity clusters described
in the paper were manually annotated.
Whole genome comparisons

We aligned draft genomes against reference Xanthomonas genomes using nucmer [31] of MUMmer program
(version 3.20) and dnadiff was used to calculate percentage of aligned sequences. We have also compared genomes using the MUM index [30] to measure distances
between two genomes. The maximal unique exact
matches index (MUMi) distance calculation was performed using the Mummer program (version 3.20).
Mummer was run on concatenated contigs or replicons
(achieved by inserting a string of 20 symbols ‘N’
between contig or replicon sequences) of each genome.
The distance calculations performed using the MUMi
script are based on the number of maximal unique
matches of a given minimal length shared by two genomes being compared. MUMi values vary from 0 for
identical genomes to 1 for very distant genomes [30].
Phylogenetic analysis

MLST sequences (fusA, gapA, gltA, gyrB, lacF, lepA) for
all the genomes were obtained in concatenated form
from PAMDB website http://pamdb.org. Genes and
their corresponding amino acid sequences spanning
gum, hrp cluster were downloaded from NCBI genbank
sequences of sequenced genomes. Amino acid sequences
of proteins of these clusters for Xcv and Xcc were used
as query to search for homology against draft genomes
of Xp, Xv and Xg. The amino acid sequences were then
concatenated for each pathogenicity cluster and then
aligned using CLUSTALW ignoring gaps. Neighbourjoining trees were constructed with boostrap value for
1000 replicates using MEGA4 [98]. Codon positions
included were 1st+2nd+3rd+Noncoding. All positions
containing gaps and missing data were eliminated from
the dataset (Complete deletion option). There were a
total of 2723 positions in the final dataset.
Phylogeny reconstruction

Species tree. We used a supermatrix approach as in previous work [25]. Protein sequences of six Xanthomonas
genomes (ingroups) and the S. maltophilia R551-3 genome (outgroup) were clustered in 5,096 families using
OrthoMCL [99]. We then selected families with one and
only one representative from each of the ingroup genomes and at most one outgroup protein, resulting in

Potnis et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:146
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/146

2,282 families. Their sequences were aligned using
MUSCLE [100] and the resulting alignments were concatenated. Non-informative columns were removed
using Gblocks [101], resulting in 792,079 positions.
RAxML [102] with the PROTGAMMAWAGF model
was used to build the final tree.
Prediction of effector repertoires, cloning of candidate
effectors and confirmation using avrBs2 reporter gene
assay

A database was created collecting all the known plant
and animal pathogen effectors. Using all these known
effectors as query, tblastn analysis was performed
against all contigs of the draft genomes of Xv, Xg and
Xp with e-value of 10 -5 [103]. Pfam domains were
searched for possible domains found in known effectors
in predicted set of ORFs of draft genome sequences.
Candidate effectors were classified according to the
nomenclature and classification scheme for effectors in
xanthomonads recently [24]. Candidate effectors showing < 45% identity at amino acid level to the known
effectors were confirmed for their translocation using
avrBs2 reporter gene assay.
N-terminal 100 amino acid region along with
upstream 500 bps sequence of candidate genes were
PCR amplified using primers with BglII restriction sites
at the 5’ ends. Following digestion with BglII, PCR
amplicons were ligated with BglII-digested pBS(BglII::
avrBs262-574::HA) (courtesy of Dr. Mary Beth Mudgett,
Stanford university), and later transformed into E. coli
DH5a. In-frame fusions were confirmed by DNA
sequencing using F20 and R24 primers. BamHI-KpnI
fragments containing the candidate gene fused to avrBs2
was then cloned into pUFR034. Resulting plasmids were
then introduced into Xcv pepper race 6 (TED3 containing mutation in avrBs2) by tri-parental mating. The
resulting Xcv strains were inoculated on Bs2 pepper cv.
ECW 20R and kept at 28°C in growth room. After 24
hours, strong HR was indicating successful translocation
of candidate effector fusions.
Cloning of pepper specificity genes in Xp

The three genes mentioned above were cloned individually and in combination in pLAFR3 vector and conjugated in Xp 91-118 ΔavrXv3 mutant PM1. The PM1
transconjugants with the three individual genes and
combined ones along with virulent pepper race 6 strain
were infiltrated at 105 CFU/ml concentration in pepper
cv. ECW and leaves were sampled at every 48 hours
after inoculation. The samples were plated on nutrient
agar, incubated at 27°C and CFU/ml counts were enumerated. Experiment was carried out in triplicate and
repeated three times.

Authors’ contributions
JBJ conceived the project. JBJ and BJS oversaw genomic sequencing. JBJ
provided the strains. KK did genome assembly. NP, RPR, RK, VC, PBP, FB
annotated pathogenicity clusters in the genomes. DJN and BJS helped
create an effector database. NP carried out effector analysis and confirmed
them experimentally. NP, BAV, RK, FFW and JBJ interpreted effector analysis.
NP, RPR, RK, VC, JFP, PBP, JMD, MS, TM did analyses of different
pathogenicity clusters of the three genomes and helped writing
corresponding sections in the manuscript. NP oversaw the experimental
validations of the pathogenicity clusters. NFA created ortholog families, and
did phylogenetic analysis based on all orthologus families of the three draft
genomes and the reference genomes. JCS did MUMi analysis and
constructed phylogenetic tree based on that analysis. NP generated the
GenBank files. DJN, BJS, FFW, RK, JBJ, BAV, JFP, and JCS helped with data
analyses. NP and JBJ wrote the final manuscript. All authors approved the
final manuscript.
