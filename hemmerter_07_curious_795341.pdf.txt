Abstract
Background: The mosquito Culex annulirostris Skuse (Diptera: Culicidae) is the major vector of endemic arboviruses in
Australia and is also responsible for the establishment of the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) in southern Papua New Guinea
(PNG) as well as its incursions into northern Australia. Papua New Guinea and mainland Australia are separated by a small
stretch of water, the Torres Strait, and its islands. While there has been regular JEV activity on these islands, JEV has not
established on mainland Australia despite an abundance of Cx. annulirostris and porcine amplifying hosts. Despite the public health
significance of this mosquito and the fact that its adults show overlapping morphology with close relative Cx. palpalis Taylor, its
evolution and genetic structure remain undetermined. We address a hypothesis that there is significant genetic diversity in Cx.
annulirostris and that the identification of this diversity will shed light on the paradox that JEV can cycle on an island 70 km from
mainland Australia while not establishing in Australia itself.
Results: We sequenced 538 bp of the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome oxidase I gene from 273 individuals collected from 43
localities in Australia and the southwest Pacific region to describe the phylogeography of Cx. annulirostris and its sister species
Cx. palpalis. Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian analyses reveal supporting evidence for multiple divergent lineages that display
geographic restriction. Culex palpalis contained three divergent lineages geographically restricted to southern Australia, northern
Australia and Papua New Guinea (PNG). Culex annulirostris contained five geographically restricted divergent lineages, with one
lineage restricted to the Solomon Islands and two identified mainly within Australia while two other lineages showed
distributions in PNG and the Torres Strait Islands with a southern limit at the top of Australia's Cape York Peninsula.
Conclusion: The existence of divergent mitochondrial lineages within Cx. annulirostris and Cx. palpalis helps explain the difficulty
of using adult morphology to identify Cx. annulirostris and its ecological diversity. Notably, the southern limit of the PNG lineages
of Cx. annulirostris coincides exactly with the current southern limit of JEV activity in Australasia suggesting that variation in these
COI lineages may be the key to why JEV has not yet established yet on mainland Australia.

Background
Northern Australia has the ideal conditions for the establishment of the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), given its
dual abundance of both Culex annulirostris Skuse – a vector identified as transmitting JEV in the region [1,2] – and
the feral pig populations that act as principal amplifying
hosts for the virus's transmission to humans [3]. Over the
last decade JEV has become endemic in Papua New
Guinea (PNG), and now cycles yearly on islands in the
Torres Strait 70 km from mainland Australia (see Figure 1;
[4]). It has appeared twice on Australia's Cape York since
1998, but in each case the virus did not establish [4,5].
Given these conditions, the failure of JEV to establish itself
on the Australian continent over the past decade has perplexed researchers. Suggested explanations for this have
included the presence of alternative blood-meal hosts and
competition with antigenically related arboviruses for susceptible vertebrate hosts [5]. But another possibility is that
unrecognized species or population variation of this vector throughout southern PNG and northern Australia
itself may limit the establishment of JEV. Are there differences between the Cx. annulirostris populations that exist
where JEV occurs in PNG and the Torres Strait, and in
mainland Australia that work to contain rather than
spread JEV throughout this region? As this first unravelling of the genetic diversity of this species and its closely
related sister species suggests, population variation
around the southern limit of JEV may in fact restrict the
movement of an arbovirus.
Although mosquitoes are the vectors of pathogens that
cause significant human disease, their genetic diversity
remains poorly understood. In our region of Australasia
(Australia and the southwest Pacific) the closely related
mosquito species Cx. annulirostris, Cx. palpalis Taylor and
the coastally restricted Cx. sitiens Wiedemann are abundant with distributions in Australia, Papua New Guinea
(PNG) and the Solomon Islands [6]. The morphospecies
Cx. annulirostris transmits exotic JEV and is also Australia's
principal vector of endemic arboviruses that cause human
disease, including Ross River virus, Barmah Forest virus,
Murray Valley encephalitis virus and Kunjin virus (a subtype of West Nile Virus) [1,3,7-9]]. The potential establishment of JEV in northern Australia is of serious concern
to public health officials in Australia [9], as this virus,
which was restricted to Southeast Asia, is responsible for
an estimated 30,000–50,000 cases there annually [10].
Yet despite regular JEV activity in the Torres Strait and
seroconversions of sentinel animals in 1998 and 2002 on
Australia's Cape York, there is no evidence that JEV has
become enzootic on the Australian mainland [5].
Overlapping morphology exists between these Culex taxa
and allozyme and PCR-based procedures, previously

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/100

developed to separate these mosquitoes, have suggested
the presence of cryptic species within these morphospecies [11,12]. In this study we have sequenced the cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene (COI) to look at the genetic
structure, evolution and distribution of Cx. annulirostis,
Cx. palpalis and Cx. sitiens collected in Australasia. We
evaluate this DNA barcoding marker in a phylogenetic
framework to examine the genetic diversity of three Culex
morphospecies, one of which is the most important arbovirus vector in Australasia.
We present sequence data generated from 273 mosquitoes
that support the distinction of the three morphospecies,
as well as the recognition of multiple divergent lineages.
The phylogeographic pattern is most complex in Cx. annulirostris with two distinct paraphyletic lineages recognized
within Australia – both independently related to the PNG
lineages. This data provides phylogenetic support for a
recent historical connection of mosquito populations in
Australia and PNG that will facilitate more rational arbovirus competency experiments and better surveillance for
these mosquitoes in the future. Importantly, the southern
limit of the two PNG Cx. annulirostris lineages equates
exactly to the current southern limit of JEV activity in the
Australasian region.

Results
Mosquito identification: morphology versus rDNA ITS1
and COI
There was 10% incongruity between the ITS1 diagnostic
results and the morphology of 218 field collected adults
(see Additional file 1). For Cx. annulirostris, correct morphological identification occurred 95.6% of the time (8
individuals out of 180 were incorrectly identified as Cx.
palpalis), 95.5% for Cx. sitiens (1 out of 22 individuals was
incorrectly identified as Cx. annulirostris) and 62.5% for
Cx. palpalis (14 of 40 were incorrectly identified as Cx.
annulirostris and one as Cx. sitiens). These results confirm
the difficulty distinguishing Cx. palpalis from Cx. annulirostris and highlight the fact that Cx. palpalis is probably
underrepresented in studies that use morphology only for
species discrimination.

Of 182 different COI haplotypes found in 273 field-collected mosquitoes – comprising 28 Cx. sitiens, 208 Cx.
annulirostris and 37 Cx. palpalis – there was 100% agreement between the ITS1 diagnostic and the COI sequence
grouping of Culex spp. The final sequence alignment (see
Additional file 3) was 538 nucleotides of which 77% (414
nt) were constant, 19% (100 nt) were parsimony informative and the remaining 4% (24 nt) represented unique
singletons. The majority (89%) of the parsimony informative sites were detected at the 3rd codon position, compared with 11% at the 1st codon position and none in the
2nd position. A pronounced AT-bias was observed at the

(A) Map of collection sites in Australasia with proportional distribution of Cx. annulirostris COI lineages. Collection sites are indicated 1–30 (for locality details see Table 1, Supplementary see Additional file 1 and 2). Pie chart graphs indicate the distributional frequency of Cx. annulirostris haplotypes representing the five identified mtDNA COI lineages. The size of
the pie charts' segments is proportional to the number of mosquitoes identified as Cx. annulirostris, which is also indicated in
brackets. Haplotype a51 from the laboratory colony at AMI in Queensland, Australia, is not included. (B) Summarized Bayesian phylogenetic tree. Phylogenetic tree of Cx. annulirostris showing 134 COI haplotypes compressed into the 5 different lineages of Cx. annulirostris. Branch support is Bayesian posterior probability/ML bootstraps (expanded in Figure 2). Haplotypes
belonging to Cx. sitiens were used as an outgroup.

3rd codon position and when the three codons were
examined separately, differences in nucleotide compositions were observed. For example, at the first codon position, guanine was represented 30.6% of the time,
compared to 15.7% in the second codon position and
2.4% in the third codon position, suggesting that significant differences in the model of sequence evolution
between three codon positions are required. To counterbalance the effect of discrepancy between codon position
and nucleotide diversity, a GTR model (which allows for
the variation of base frequencies and unique probability
for each of the six possible substitution classes) was
selected in agreement with ModelTest 3.6 [13] for the
Maximum Likelihood analyses. The complex model of
substitution including gamma distribution and invariant
sites (GTR+Γ+I) was selected for the full alignment by the
hierarchical likelihood ratio test (LRT) as well as the

Akaike information criterion (AIC). Moreover, the dataset
for the Bayesian analysis was separated into partitions corresponding to first, second and third codon positions,
thus allowing application of independent parameters for
these partitions in order to better fit the model to the dataset.
The translation of the nucleotide sequence into an amino
acid sequence, using the invertebrate genetic code,
showed identical amino acid sequences for all considered
haplotypes in the three species, except for a single amino
acid valine substituted to leucine in haplotype a126
(DQ673707) of Cx. annulirostris collected in PNG. Both
valine and leucine are similar in their chemical properties,
being non-charged and hydrophobic. This mutation has
been verified using three independent PCR amplifications
and direct bidirectional sequencing.

Both the Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian methods
show that the COI was able to discriminate the three taxa
and confirmed all ITS1 identifications as well as several
divergent lineages within Cx. annulirostris and Cx. palpalis
(Figure 2 and see Additional file 1). Both phylogenetic
methods produced the same tree with Maximum Likelihood showing lower branch support.
Culex sitiens was the most divergent taxon, showing little
geographic structure; the same haplotypes (s9, s8)
occurred on both the east and west coasts of Australia. The
haplotypes (s11–s14) from PNG do form a clade within
the Australian grouping (s1–10, s15), but as only 26 individuals were assessed little can be interpreted from this.
Both phylogenetic methods support the division of Cx.
palpalis into three divergent lineages (pal-N-AUS, pal-SAUS and pal-PNG) that show no geographic overlap (see
Additional file 2). The pal-PNG lineage was restricted to
PNG and the Torres Strait; the pal-N-AUS lineage was
restricted to northern Australia; and the pal-S-AUS was
found only in southern Australia.
Culex annulirostris comprised four distinct lineages (annPNG1, ann-SI, ann-S-AUS and ann-AUS) with a fifth sublineage identified within the ann-AUS lineage (annPNG2) in Figures 1 and 2 due partly to the restricted distribution of this clade, which is the same as ann-PNG1.
These lineages showed clear geographic structure (Figure
1). The ann-AUS lineage exists throughout Australia and
southern PNG while the ann-S-AUS lineage appears to be
more abundant in southern Australia making up 92%
(11/12 mosquitoes) of collections in South Australia
(sites 8 and 9) and also appearing sporadically along the
east coast of Australia (single individuals identified at sites
15, 16 and 23). The PNG lineages ann-PNG1 and annPNG2 accounted for 76% of Cx. annulirostris in PNG (44/
58 mosquitoes) with the Torres Strait and the top of
Queensland's Cape York Peninsula representing their
southern limit (sites 23 and 22). A fifth lineage ann-SI
occurred only in the Solomon Islands (sites 28 and 29).
Haplotype diversity was very high in all lineages with
most lineages showing values above 0.85 (Table 1). Apart
from the major lineages described above and the sublineage ann-PNG2, no phylogeographic structure was found
among the remaining haplotypes.
Genetic relationships within and between identified COI
lineages
To evaluate the effectiveness of the barcoding methodology for identifying species biodiversity, we assessed the
inter- and intraspecies divergence before and after the split
of Cx. annulirostis and Cx. palpalis into their eight different
lineages. For each population (species or lineages) we

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/100

compared their minimum distance to a congener with the
maximum divergence within each population (Figure 3).
A threshold value of 3% was used to separate the graph
into four quadrants representing the different categories
of species [14,15]. The top right quadrant represents a
high intra- and interspecific diversity suggesting that cryptic species are present, and the top left quadrant indicates
high interspecific and low intraspecific diversity suggesting no cryptic species. The morphospecies Cx. annulirostris
and Cx. palpalis appear in the top right quadrant (Figure
3A), indicating high levels of genetic diversity within and
between species and suggesting these as candidates for a
taxonomic split [15]. The presence of Cx. sitiens in the top
left quadrant of Figure 3A indicates that it did not display
sufficient within-species variation to generate doubt as to
whether it was a single biological entity. When the five lineages of Cx. annulirostris and the three lineages of Cx. palpalis, identified through phylogenetic inference, were
reanalyzed, all eight lineages appeared in the bottom left
quadrant (Figure 3B), suggesting recently diverged populations and/or newly emerged species [15].
Alternative tree topologies
Maximum Likelihood methods were used to further characterize the phylogenetic relationship by testing alternative (constrained) trees. We used three haplotype subsets
and inferred constrained trees using the AU-test and the
SH-test [16] to test if the constrained trees were significantly better than our best unconstrained tree (Figure 4
and Table 2). First we constructed and bootstrapped an
unconstrained tree using two alternative heuristic searching algorithms; this found trees showing identical topology with marginal differences in branch support (Figure
4). The relationship of the three Cx. palpalis lineages was
not fully resolved in the unconstrained tree and so we
tested whether an alternative branching of these three lineages of Cx. palpalis would be rejected if compared to the
unconstrained topology supporting the following: [(palS-AUS, pal-PNG), pal-N-AUS]. The AU-test and SH-test
could not reject the alternative topologies (Table 2, Nos. I
and II), indicating a trichotomy of the three lineages due
to the lack of a robust phylogenetic signal.

Next we tested if we could reject the monophyly of the
Australian lineages of Cx. annulirostris ann-AUS and annS-AUS as these two lineages appeared to be polyphyletic
on the unconstrained tree (Figure 4). The AU-test and SHtest rejected this constraint in subset 1 and 2 (Table 2,
Nos. III), and thus supported the separate evolutionary
origin of the two Australian Cx. annulirostris lineages. In
subset 3, this topology was not rejected although the Pvalues for both tests were low. Similarly, the monophyly
of the Cx. annulirostris lineage ann-PNG2 with ann-PNG1
in PNG was rejected by both tests in all three subsets
(Table 2, Nos. IV).

The Cx. annulirostris lineage ann-SI from the Solomon
Islands proved problematic as its placement on the phylogenetic tree was ambiguous (Figure 4). Neither the AUtest nor the SH-test could reject the alternative placing of
ann-SI: (i) as a sister to the rest of Cx. annulirostris with Cx.
palpalis (Table 2, Nos. V); (ii) as a sister to the rest of Cx.
palpalis only (Table 2, Nos. VI); or (iii) as a sister to the rest
of Cx. annulirostris only (Table 2, Nos. VII). Hence, the
evolutionary origin for the ann-SI lineage is unresolved.

Discussion
Culex annulirostris and Cx. palpalis have overlapping morphology and are made up of several distinct COI lineages
whose major groupings are congruent with the ITS1 diagnostic developed to separate these cryptic species [12].
Culex sitiens was most divergent and showed little genetic
or geographic structure throughout our collection sites in
Australia, PNG and Timor Leste. Its use of salt and brackish water larval habitats has allowed for the rapid exploitation of uniform coastal habitats throughout an
extensive distribution that spans from Asia to Australia
[6,17].
Culex palpalis comprises three geographically structured
COI lineages. The branch to the pal-S-AUS lineage from
southern Australia (site 10) is well supported. The palPNG and pal-N-AUS lineages are supported biologically
in that they appear restricted to southwest PNG and the
Torres Strait (pal-PNG, sites 23, 24 and 25) and to northern Australia (pal-N-AUS, sites 1, 2, 18, 20 and 22). The
larval habitats of this mosquito are fresh-water sites with
relatively low levels of organic matter [6].
The four major lineages of Cx. annulirostris indicate
extended allopatric isolation, while the sublineage annPNG2 is a more recent event. The ann-SI lineage includes
specimens from the north and south Solomon Islands
and probably represents a separate Pacific island species.
The ann-S-AUS lineage is more common throughout
southern Australia and is found in much lower relative
numbers along eastern Australia and in Torres Strait; no
ann-S-AUS individuals were identified from the Northern

Territory or Western Australia. The Australian lineage
(ann-AUS) is the largest and most widespread, found
throughout Australia and extending well into PNG with
one haplotype found in Timor Leste (site 30). There is
increasing evidence that ann-AUS may not have the intrinsic or extrinsic ability to be an effective JEV vector. Bloodmeal studies from Cx. annulirostris mosquitoes collected
in northern Queensland and Cape York, that would represent ann-AUS, indicate a feeding preference for marsupials, thus diverting host-seeking mosquitoes away from
pigs and decreasing this lineage's efficiency as JEV vector
[18]. Additionally, JEV vector competency studies suggest
that ann-AUS may be a relatively inefficient laboratory
vector for the JEV genotype I strain which has been present
in the Torres Strait and northern Queensland since 2000
(A. F. van den Hurk, unpublished data). The ann-PNG1
and ann-PNG2 lineages exist in PNG and the Torres Strait,
and though the monophyly of these two lineages is
rejected, they both show a southern limit at the top of
Australia's Cape York Peninsula (site 22), which correlates
exactly with the current southern limit of JEV activity [5].
In light of this COI diversity it is not surprising that Cx.
annulirostris is found in a wide variety of larval habitats
including fresh and slightly brackish water, and in habitats with relatively high levels of organic matter as well as
transient habitats [6,19,20]. If these divergent lineages
represent separate biological species, it is unlikely that
morphology will distinguish these taxa and another DNAbased diagnostic tool will be required to study these mosquitoes.
Mosquito phylogeography in Australasia
The geological events of the Miocene, Pliocene and Pleistocene are believed to be responsible for considerable speciation events in this region [21,22]. There were probably
two dispersal opportunities for culicid fauna to move east
into the Australian region. The first was during the early
Pliocene (5-3.4 mya) when the Indo-Malayan Archipelago was in place and an easterly spread of Oriental fauna
was possible. The second was during the Pleistocene glaciation periods (1.6-0.01 mya), when vast areas of the

pelagos) and Sahul shelf (joining Australia and New
Guinea) were exposed, facilitating the movement of fauna
down the Indo-Malayan Archipelago [23]. Present coastlines of New Guinea and northern Australia were formed
approximately 15,000-8,000 years ago and the land
bridge between Australia, the Torres Strait and New
Guinea was last flooded 8,000-6,000 years ago [23,24].
We suggest two different biogeographic histories for these
Culex taxa. Culex annulirostris and Cx. palpalis have distributions limited mostly to Australasia, with genetic and
geographic structure suggestive of an extended evolutionary history in this region allowing the evolution of multiple divergent lineages. Thus Cx. annulirostris, Cx. palpalis or
an ancestor thereof appeared during the early Pliocene (53.4 mya), which would have permitted the necessary evolutionary time for geographic expansion and the development of divergent lineages. Since Cx. sitiens displays little
genetic or geographic structure in Australia and has a distribution spanning Australasia and Southeast Asia to as far
north as India [17], we suggest a more recent expansion
into Australasia, probably during one of the more recent
Pleistocene glaciations (1.6-0.01 mya).
Barcoding closely related Culex taxa
The mtDNA COI sequence has been assessed as a marker
for evaluating mosquito diversity and has proved useful in
DNA barcoding studies of mosquitoes across several genera and species identified through conventional morphological taxonomy [25,26]. In insect molecular systematics,
other markers have been used with success: 18S rDNA,
28S rDNA, NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 and cytochrome
oxidase II [27,28]. Here we have used the COI marker on
closely related Culex mosquito taxa that were genetically
identified to species using the ITS1 [12]. We employed a
Maximum Likelihood framework for hypothesis testing
[16] that provided insights into the evolutionary history
of these three taxa. As both ITS1 markers and COI con-

curred with the latter, revealing several more divergent lineages within these taxa, we advocate that COI is a
reasonable starting point for molecular identification of
potential cryptic mosquito species of the genus Culex.

Conclusion
The different geographic distributions of these distinct lineages suggest biological variety and thus it is reasonable to
assume that many of these lineages will have different
abilities to transmit endemic and exotic arboviruses. The
coincidental southern limit of ann-PNG1, ann-PNG2 and
JEV activity presents a plausible hypothesis as to why JEV
has not established on the Australian mainland, despite
the apparent abundance of local Cx. annulirostris vectors
and feral pig amplifying hosts [3]. As stressed above, the
endemic ann-AUS lineage may not be an effective JEV vector due to its local marsupial feeding preferences and relative inefficiency in transmitting the JEV genotype I strain
and thus may provide northern Australia with a natural
buffer zone [18]. If either ann-PNG1 or ann-PNG2 is
responsible for this JEV activity it is important to determine their species status and monitor their distributions
to determine if they are moving south into Australia. If
these lineages are not separate species then there is the
possibility for gene flow from the PNG lineages to the
ann-AUS lineage on the Australian mainland, and this
may enhance the JEV potential of local ann-AUS populations. Analysis of the vector competency of individual lineages is now required to characterize their intrinsic ability
to transmit JEV, while nuclear DNA studies on sympatric
populations would establish if natural mating barriers
exist.
The question must now be asked as to whether ann-PNG1
and ann-PNG2 are exotic taxa naturally expanding their
range from southwest PNG into Australia – or are we
observing the effects of climate change, such as have been
suggested for the spread of the bluetounge arbovirus

through Europe alongside the northward movement of its
Culicoides vectors [29]. In Australia, rapid shifts of latitude
clines in Drosophila over the last 20 years have provided
evidence for biological changes through regional warming
in Queensland [30], and this may also facilitate the expansion of independently mobile fauna from New Guinea.

Methods
Specimen collection and identification
Mosquitoes were collected from 43 sites representing 30
map locations in Australia, PNG, Timor Leste and the
Solomon Islands (Bougainville and Guadalcanal) (see
Figure 1, see Additional file 1 and 2). Adult mosquitoes
were collected using CO2-baited encephalitis virus surveillance (EVS) traps with and without 1-octen-3-ol (octenol). Specimens were morphologically identified using
the keys of Lee et al. [6] and Marks [31]. Mosquitoes were
stored in liquid nitrogen, dry ice, on silica gel, or in 70%
ethanol prior to total DNA extraction. Colony Cx. annulirostris from the Army Malaria Institute (Brisbane, Queensland, Australia) were used as reference material. Total
DNA was extracted from mosquitoes using a salt extraction and ethanol precipitation procedure [12]. Due to
problems with adult morphology, all material was genetically identified to species by an ITS1 PCR-RFLP procedure
previously developed to discriminate between Cx. annulirostris, Cx. palpalis and Cx. sitiens [12].
Genetic analysis COI amplification
A 538 bp 5' fragment of the COI gene was PCR amplified
and sequenced using the same primer pair for amplification and sequencing; F-COI50 (5'-GTA GTT TAG TAG
AAA ATG GAG C-3') and R-COI650 (5'-TAG CAG AAG
TAA AAT AAG CTC G-3'). Reactions of 25 μl contained 2.5
mM MgCl2, 200 pM for each dNTP, 0.6 unit Taq (Fisher
Biotech, WA, Australia), and approximately 1–10 ng of
genomic DNA template (~1 μl). The cycling was as follows; denaturing at 94°C for 3 min followed by 35 cycles
of 94°C for 1 min, 48°C for 1 min, 72°C for 1 min, and
a final elongation for 3 min at 72°C. The correctly sized
PCR product was verified on agarose gel and the remainder purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Individual PCR products were directly sequenced in
both directions at the Australian Genome Research Facility (University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia). Haplotype a126 was PCR amplified and sequenced three
times to confirm its unique amino acid substitution.
Sequences have been deposited in GenBank [GenBank:
DQ673677–DQ673858].
COI sequence analysis
Individual sequences were assembled with Sequencer
4.2.2 (GeneCodes, MI, USA). Nucleotide and haplotype
diversity within the lineages identified was calculated
using DNASP 4.10 [32]. Identical haplotypes were pooled

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/100

and only unique haplotypes were used for further analysis. Composition of the nucleotide sequences was analyzed using MEGA 3.1 [33]. Sequence divergences were
calculated using the Kimura 2 parameter distance model
using MEGA 3.1 [33]. The maximum of intra-population
distance and the minimum of inter-population distance
were calculated using MEGA 3.1. We applied a 3% threshold to represent different categories of "species" [14].
A multiple sequence alignment was constructed comprising 182 unique haplotypes from 208 Cx. annulirostris, 37
Cx. palpalis and 28 Cx. sitiens (see Additional file 3). Haplotypes of Cx. sitiens served as an outgroup. The alignment
consisted of 538 nt coding for 179 amino acids using the
invertebrate mitochondrial code (Supplementary Alignment A1). The nucleotide sequence alignment was analyzed using Maximum Likelihood with the GTR+Γ+I
model using PhyML 2.4.4 [34]. The robustness of the
Maximum Likelihood tree was evaluated by the bootstrapping method with 500 replicates using PhyML. For
the nucleotide model selection we employed a hierarchical likelihood ratio test (LRT) as well as the Akaike information criterion (AIC) implemented in ModelTest 3.6
[13] in cooperation with PAUP* 4b10 [35].
In addition, the dataset was analysed by Bayesian phylogenetic analysis using MrBayes 3.1.2 [36]. We took advantage of MrBayes' ability to relax the parameters of the
nucleotide model over subsets of the alignment, in order
to better model the nucleotide evolution – particularly at
different nucleotide coding positions [36]. A covarion
model was used to better model the between-lineage variability [37].
Initially the alignment was divided into partitions based
on coding position. Then we unlinked the parameters
(shape, revmat, statefreq) between these partitions and
applied a 4× 4 nucleotide model. Finally, for the 1st and
2nd codon positions we used the model with only one
substitution category with all rates equal (F81 model),
and for the 3rd codon position we used the model with 6
categories with a gamma shape parameter plus invariants
including the covarion parameter (GTR+Γ+I+cov model).
Metropolis-coupled Markov chain Monte Carlo analyses
were run with one cold and three heated chains (temperature set to default 0.2) for 5,000,000 generations and
sampled every 200 generations. This process was performed three times from a random starting tree and ran
well beyond convergence. Trees before convergence were
discarded for the reconstruction of the consensus Bayesian tree with posterior probabilities.
Alternative tree topology testing using haplotype subsets
To further address the phylogenetic relationship within
the obtained haplotypes, we restricted the alignment into

Page 9 of 11

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:100

three subsets, each comprising 18 haplotypes (10 haplotypes from Cx. annulirostris, 6 from Cx. palpalis and 2 from
Cx. sitiens which served as an outgroup). Given that Maximum Likelihood calculations with all haplotypes were
prohibitively time-consuming, these subsets served as surrogate abstractions of the full dataset. For each lineage
unit we selected two haplotypes based on the following
approach: Subset 1 – an ancestor haplotype and its closest
haplotype (a44, a51, a89, a92, a98, a103, a117, a119,
a128, a132, p12, p25, p28, p29, p30, p33, s7, s8); Subset
2 – two haplotypes from network extremities (a51, a64,
a89, a93, a98, a99, a119, a107, a128, a131, p10, p20,
p25, p30, p32, p33, s9, s8); and Subset 3 – an ancestor
and an extremity of the network (a64, a66, a88, a93, a99,
a102, a107, a113, a130, a131, p5, p10, p20, p22, p31,
p32, s4, s9). Calculations on the three subsets enabled us
to map the variability of the haplotype phylogenies. For
each subset we calculated a Maximum Likelihood tree
with bootstraps and applied a variety of constraints to test
both our hypothesis and the robustness of the optimal
tree.
The best trees and all constraints were inferred in
PAUP*4b10 [35]. We first reconstructed a Neighbour
joining tree and used it to estimate the GTR+Γ+I likelihood parameter. Then the parameters were fixed and used
in the inference of a Maximum Likelihood tree using a
heuristic search with 20 random sequence additions with
NNI swapping. The resulting GTR+Γ+I model parameters
were used for the Maximum Likelihood tree reconstruction for the unconstrained tree as well as for all constrained trees. For the unconstrained trees we calculated
bootstraps using 100 replicates. Site likelihoods for individual trees were calculated using PAUP*4b10 [35] and
these were used for the Approximately Unbiased (AU) test
[16] and the Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH) test [38], both
implemented in CONSEL 0.1 h [39]. A value of P>0.05
was considered statistically significant to reject the
hypothesis that the two trees were significantly different.
