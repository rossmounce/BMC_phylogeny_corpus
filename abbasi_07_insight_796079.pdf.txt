Abstract
Background: The human chromosomes 2q, 7, 12q and 17q show extensive intra-genomic
homology, containing duplicate, triplicate and quadruplicate paralogous regions centered on the
HOX gene clusters. The fact that two or more representatives of different gene families are linked
with HOX clusters is taken as evidence that these paralogous gene sets might have arisen from a
single chromosomal segment through block or whole chromosome duplication events. This would
imply that the constituent genes including the HOX clusters reflect the architecture of a single
ancestral block (before vertebrate origin) where all of these genes were linked in a single copy.
Results: In the present study we have employed the currently available set of protein data for a
wide variety of vertebrate and invertebrate genomes to analyze the phylogenetic history of 11
multigene families with three or more of their representatives linked to human HOX clusters. A
topology comparison approach revealed four discrete co-duplicated groups: group 1 involves the
genes from GLI, HH, INHB, IGFBP (cluster-1), and SLC4A families; group 2 involves ERBB,
ZNFN1A, and IGFBP (cluster-2) gene families; group 3 involves the HOX clusters and the SP gene
family; group 4 involves the integrin beta chain and myosine light chain families. The distinct genes
within each co-duplicated group share the same evolutionary history and are duplicated in concert
with each other, while the constituent genes of two different co-duplicated groups may not share
their evolutionary history and may not have duplicated simultaneously.
Conclusion: We conclude that co-duplicated groups may themselves be remnants of ancient
small-scale duplications (involving chromosomal segments or gene-clusters) which occurred at
different time points during chordate evolution. Whereas the recent combination of genes from
distinct co-duplicated groups on different chromosomal regions (human chromosomes 2q, 7, 12q,
and 17q) is probably the outcome of subsequent rearrangement of genomic segments, including
syntenic groups of genes.

Background
During the evolutionary history of life on Earth there has
been a trend towards drastic transitions from simple to
more complex life forms, like from unicellular bacterium
to simple multicellular Placozans, diploblastic organisms

with two germ layers to bilaterians with a third germ layer,
simple chordates to vertebrates [1]. The innovation of
new structures and functions during these macroevolutionary events has in part been accomplished through
expansion in the genetic toolkit, e.g. by gene duplications

[2]. In fact, extensive gene duplications have been suggested at the base of vertebrate lineage which results in
widespread existence of gene families in modern vertebrates [3-6]. Expansions in gene number are associated
with the evolution of increased morphological and anatomical complexity and diversity achieved by vertebrates
compared to basal chordates (cephalochordates/tunicates). The organization of paralogous regions (paralogons) in the human and other vertebrate genomes have
led to the hypothesis of multiple block duplication events
involving large chromosomal segments or even two
rounds of whole genome duplication (2R hypothesis) [711] early in the history of vertebrate evolution after their
divergence from an amphioxus-like invertebrate ancestor.
In contrast to block duplication events, an alternative
model of continuous wave of small-scale gene duplications (involving single genes or chromosomal segments)
was suggested to explain the numerous paralogs in vertebrates [12-14].
Phylogenetic trees can be used to test the 2R hypothesis. If
two rounds of genome duplication occurred, a tree for
four vertebrate paralogous genes should exhibit the topology of the form (AB)(CD), where the first genome duplication produced the common ancestor of the sequences
A/B and C/D and the second genome duplication split
these two lineages simultaneously. Thus, under the
assumption of the 2R hypothesis the neighboring gene
families within potentially quadruplicated regions of the
human genome should not only show the same but also
the specific type of topology [13]. Nevertheless many phylogenetic analyses have not yielded a predominance of
(AB)(CD) topologies, instead a high proportion of gene
families showed an asymmetrical (A)(BCD) tree, in which
one of the four paralogues diverged prior to others, contradicting 2R [12,13,15].
The human HOX gene clusters bearing chromosomes
(Hsa 2, 7, 12 and 17) harbor one of the three large quadrupled genomic regions that have been extensively presented in the literature [8,11,14,16,17]. The fact that two
or more paralogs of numerous gene families are linked
with HOX genes suggests that these paralogous gene sets
along with the linked HOX clusters might have arisen by
duplications of an intact chromosomal segment, i.e.
through block duplication events. This extensive intragenomic synteny centered on HOX clusters has also been
seen as an argument supporting two rounds of whole
genome duplication events (2R hypothesis) in the vertebrate lineage [8,16].
In order to track the evolutionary events involved in structuring the mammalian HOX-bearing chromosomes,
Hughes and coworkers [14] conducted a phylogenetic
analysis of 42 gene families sharing members on two or

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/239

more of the human chromosomes 2, 7, 12, and 17, the
chromosomes that bear HOX clusters. These authors
found that phylogenies of 14 HOX linked gene families
supported the occurrence of genome duplications before
the protostome-deutrostome split. Members of only few
families were found to be duplicated within the time window of proposed whole genome/block duplication
events. They argued that these genes were actually not
duplicated simultaneously with the HOX clusters because
the topologies of their phylogenetic trees were not consistent with the HOX cluster phylogeny.
However Larhammar and coworkers [16] advise caution
in rejecting the block/chromosomal duplication hypothesis and argued that only genes that are anciently linked to
HOX clusters and not those that are transported on the
HOX-bearing chromosomes as a result of recent rearrangement events should be considered. They recommended the enrichment of sequence information with
diverse classes of vertebrates from mammals to fishes to
perform more thorough phylogenetic analysis. Larhammar and coworkers concluded that at least 14 gene families on human HOX-bearing chromosomes display
phylogenetic histories compatible with duplications concomitant with the HOX clusters.
In the present study, we exploit the accessibility of a huge
amount of protein data from sequencing and annotation
of increasing numbers of vertebrate genomes analyzing
the phylogenetic history of 11 HOX linked gene families
(Figure 1 and Table 1) to unravel the evolutionary events
that brought the HOX clusters and members of these gene
families in physical proximity deep in vertebrate history.
All of these gene families are anciently linked to HOX
clusters with 8 families (Figure 1 and Table 1) having their
members on all human HOX-bearing chromosomes,
while 3 gene families have paralogs linked to at least three
human HOX clusters (Figure 1 and Table 1). It is of note
that 9 of these families (Table 1) are among those 14 gene
families, which Larhammar and coworkers [16] hypothesized to be duplicated simultaneously with the linked
HOX clusters by block duplication event. For each of these
11 HOX linked gene families, the orthologous sequence
information from several vertebrate representatives from
mammals to bony fishes has been included. Thus, we performed a more robust and thorough phylogenetic analysis
compared to previous studies. Given our phylogenetic
data, we compared the topologies of those paralogous
genes of the each gene family which have arisen within
the time window of vertebrates-invertebrates and tetrapods-fishes divergence to test which genes have duplicated
concurrently with each other and with the linked HOX
clusters at the base of vertebrate lineage.

Our results show that gene families with three or more
paralogs linked to HOX clusters did not arise simultaneously through two rounds of whole chromosome or
whole genome duplication. Instead our analysis shows
that these multigene families might have arisen largely as
a result of segmental or gene-cluster duplication events,
which occurred at different time points during early evolution of vertebrate lineage.

Results and Discussion
Phylogenetic Analysis
To perform rigorous testing of the 2R hypothesis, which
advocates that four-fold paralogy regions in the human
HOX-bearing chromosomes might be remnants of polyploidy, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis of gene families with representatives linked to three or four of the
human HOX clusters. Gene families with paralogues
linked to only two HOX clusters have been left out,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/239

because their occurrence is consistent with several alternative explanatory scenarios.
Fibrillar Collagen Family â COL
The phylogenetic tree of collagen genes was previously
constructed by Bailey and coworkers [18]. Their analysis
was based on sequence data from very few species
(human, mouse and chicken). In this phylogeny, collagen
genes on human chromosomes 7, 12 and 17 formed unresolved trichotomy, while genes on chromosome 2 formed
an outgroup.

Here, we reanalyze the phylogenetic history of collagen
genes by including the sequences from representative
members of teleost and tetrapod lineages, thus depicting
a clearer picture of evolutionary relationship among
members of this family (Figure 2). The phylogenetic tree
suggests that duplication events giving rise to members of

vertebrate collagen gene family occurred prior to the
actinopterygii-sarcopterygii and after the echinodermschordates split. For the COL3A1 gene the respective time
points have not been defined with confidence because
orthologous sequences from actinopterygii are unavailable. Phylogeny indicates with bootstrap support of 83%
that COL5A2 was the first molecule of this family to
diverge. The remaining family members showed the
topology of the form (A)(BCD) [13], i.e. (Hsa2)(Hsa12
Hsa17 Hsa7) with COL3A1 falling outside the cluster of
COL2A1, COL1A1, and COL1A2 genes. The branch supporting this pattern received the bootstrap support of
92%.
ERBB Receptor Protein Tyrosine Kinase â ERBB
For the ERBB family a topology of the form (A)(BCD), i.e.
(Hsa12)(Hsa17 Hsa7 Hsa2) received a strong bootstrap
support (97%) with ERBB3 falling outside the cluster of
ERBB2, EGFR and ERBB4 (Figure 3).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/239

The phylogenetic tree showed strong evidence of duplications within the time window of deuterostomes-protostomes and actinopterygii-sarcopterygii split.
Insuline-like Growth Factor Binding Protein â IGFBP
The phylogenetic tree of IGFBP family contained two clusters: (I) a cluster in which the IGFBP5-IGFBP3 genes
grouped with IGFBP6, (II) a cluster of vertebrate IGFBP4IGFBP1 genes grouped with IGFBP2 (Figure 4). The bootstrap support for this pattern was significant, i.e. 99% and
91 % for the two relevant branches. The topology of the
vertebrate IGFBP family members is unique in a sense that
it can be explained by three, rather than two rounds of
gene duplication events early in vertebrate history attributed to (AB)(CD) type gene topology [13]. The most parsimonious explanation for this type of topology is: two
rounds of whole genome duplication (2R) followed by
two independent gene duplication events or three rounds
of whole genome duplication followed by two independent gene loss events. We call this topology an extended
form of (AB)(CD) type gene topology in which six genes
form two clusters, i.e. (ABC)(DEF).

Figure 4
Neighbor-Joining tree of the IGFBP family
Neighbor-Joining tree of the IGFBP family. Symbols and parameters are the same as described in Figure 2.

Phylogeny of vertebrate IGFBP proteins suggests that the
gene duplication events giving rise to members of this
family have occurred after the urchordates-vertebrates and
prior to actinopterygii- sarcopterygii split.
Integrin Î² â ITGB
In the phylogenetic tree of the integrin Î² family (Figure 5),
vertebrate ITGB5, ITGB3, ITGB6 and ITGB7 genes clustered with homologues from Drosophila and sea urchin,
indicating that these four members of the integrin Î² family diverged at least after the divergence of echinoderms
and chordates. ITGB4 and ITGB8 genes fell outside the
ITGB3-5-6-7 cluster and homologues from Drosophila,
and sea urchin. This topology suggests that gene duplication events giving rise to the ancestor of the ITGB3-5-6-7
cluster may have occurred prior to the divergence of deuterostomes and protostomes.

Myosin Light Chain â MYL
The myosin light chain family members formed two
major clusters: (I) cluster including vertebrate MYL1,
MYL4 and MYL6 genes and homologues from Drosophila
and Apis mellifera, (II) a cluster including vertebrate MYL2,
MYL7 and homologues from Drosophila and Apis mellifera
(Figure 6A). Significant bootstrap support, i.e. 100%, for
the internal branch separating the two clusters places the
divergence of the ancestors of these two groups prior to
the deuterostomes-protostomes split. Subsequent duplications might have occurred early in chordate evolution
before the actinopterygii- sarcopterygii divergence.
Sp1 c2h2-type Zinc-Finger Protein â SP
In the Sp1 c2h2-type zinc-finger protein family (Figure
6B) a significant internal branch (98% bootstrap support)
separated: (I) a cluster containing the vertebrate SP1, SP2,

SP3, and SP4 genes showing a topology of the form
(A)(BCD), i.e. (Hsa17)(Hsa12 Hsa2 Hsa7) that grouped
with a homolog from sea urchin with highly significant
bootstrap support, i.e. 98%. (II) The vertebrate SP8 molecule clustered independently with a homolog from sea
urchin (95% bootstrap support). The phylogeny suggests
that the ancestor of vertebrate SP1-4 and SP8 genes duplicated prior to the divergence of chordates and echinoderms.
Zinc-Finger Protein-Subfamily 1A â ZNFN1A
The vertebrate members of ZNFN1A family showed a
topology of the form (A)(BCD), i.e. (Hsa12)(Hsa7 Hsa17
Hsa2), with ZNFN1A4 clustered outside the other three
vertebrate genes. The branch supporting this pattern
received bootstrap support of 90% (Figure 6C). The topology of the phylogenetic tree indicated that the gene dupli-

cations giving rise to ZNFN1A family members occurred
within the time window of echinoderms-chordates and
actinopterygii-sarcopterygii split.
Anion Exchanger â SLC4A (AE)
The phylogenetic tree of SLC4A genes (Figure 6D) is
divided into two major clusters. Cluster-1 includes vertebrate members SLC4A1, SLC4A2, SLC4A3, and a
homolog from Drosophila; cluster-2 includes SLC4A5,
SLC4A8, SLC4A10, and homologues from Drosophila and
C. elegans. The internal branch separating the two clusters
received highly significant (100%) bootstrap support. The
topology suggests that gene duplication events giving rise
to ancestors of cluster-1 and cluster-2 occurred prior to
deuterostomes-protostomes divergence. Phylogeny further indicates that the mammalian SLC4A8 and SLC4A10
genes arose through the duplication of an SLC4A8-like

ancestor in the tetrapod lineage at least before the divergence of Euarchontoglires from Laurasiatheria, and the
branch supporting this pattern received 91% bootstrap
support.
GLI Zinc-Finger protein â GLI
The phylogenetic tree indicates that the GLI1, GLI2, and
GLI3 genes diverged after the separation of urchordates
from vertebrates and before the divergence of tetrapods
and bony fishes (Figure 7A). The phylogeny shows a
topology of the from (A)(BC), i.e. (Hsa12)(Hsa7 Hsa2)
with highly significant (100%) bootstrap support.
Hedgehog â HH
Vertebrate HH family members showed a topology of the
form (A)(BC), i.e. (Hsa12)(Hsa7 Hsa2), with DHH falling
outside the SHH-IHH cluster. The branch supporting this
pattern received significant (97%) bootstrap support (Figure 7B). Phylogeny attributed the birth of vertebrate HH
family members to duplications which occurred within
the time window of the cephalochordates-vertebrates and
tetrapods- fishes split.
Inhibin â INHB
The topology of vertebrate inhibin genes (Figure 7C) is
similar to HH and GLI families, i.e. (Hsa12)(Hsa7 Hsa2)
with 93% bootstrap support. Furthermore, the phylogenetic tree indicates that inhibin paralogs on Hsa12, i.e.
INHBC and INHBE originated by a duplication event in
tetrapod lineage after its divergence from bony fishes. The
branch supporting this pattern received significant (96%)
bootstrap support.
Estimation of Co-duplication Events
Given the phylogenetic data, we next sought to determine
which genes could have duplicated simultaneously. To
test this, we adopted the topology comparison approach
[14] and selected the genes from those portions of each
phylogeny, where there was a strong statistical support for
duplication events within the time window of vertebratesinvertebrates and tetrapods-fishes split (Figure 8, Table 2).
Furthermore we included the published phylogeny of vertebrate HOX clusters [19] in this test.

The topology of the type where genes on chromosomes 7
and 2 clustered together and the gene on chromosome 12
formed an outgroup (Table 2) depicts the simultaneous
duplication of members of five gene families, i.e. GLI,
HH, INHB, IGFBP (cluster-1), and SLC4A. The third member of the SLC4A family, i.e. SLC4A1, that forms an outgroup to the SLC4A2-SLC4A3 cluster, is on a different
chromosome (Hsa17), suggesting that an independent
translocation event followed the co-duplication.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/239

The topology of the type where genes on Hsa7 and Hsa17
clustered together, while the gene on Hsa2 branched next,
and the gene on Hsa12 formed an outgroup (Table 2), is
suggestive of another gene-cluster duplication event
involving the members of ERBB, ZNFN1A, and IGFBP
(cluster-2) gene families. In addition, the genes showing
the topology of the type (Hsa12) (Hsa7 Hsa17 Hsa2)
maintained exactly the same order on the respective chromosomal segments, with ZNFN1A genes flanked by ERBB
and IGFBP family members (Figure 1). This reflects a conservation of gene order following co-duplications.
In the previously published phylogeny of vertebrate HOX
clusters, HOXC and HOXD are grouped together, while
the branching order of HOXA and HOXB is unresolved;
two
alternative
topologies
(((HOXC
HOXD)HOXA)HOXB) and ((HOXC HOXD)(HOXA
HOXB)) are equally probable [19]. Within the phylogeny
of the SP family, the branching order of SP1, SP2, SP3,
and SP4 genes is congruent with one of the two proposed
alternative phylogenies of HOX clusters (Table 2). Consistent with the compatibility in their tree topologies, each
of the relevant SP genes is closely linked with the HOX
cluster (Figure 1), with human SP1 gene mapping at
approximately 526 kb centromeric to HOXC, SP2; at ~614
kb centromeric to HOXB, SP3; at ~2 Mb centromeric to
HOXD, and SP4; at ~5 Mb telomeric to HOXA. This
implies that HOX linked SP genes share the similar evolutionary history as the HOX clusters and have arisen
through the same duplication events that led to the HOX
clusters.
The phylogenies of the integrin beta chain and myosine
light chain families, where the vertebrate genes on Hsa17
and Hsa2 clustered together and the gene on Hsa12
formed an outgroup (Table 2) revealed a fourth simultaneous duplication event. The fact that ITGB3 on Hsa17
grouped with ITGB5 on Hsa3 suggests that an independent translocation event followed the duplication of their
ancestor after its divergence from the ITGB6 gene (Figure
5).
The phylogeny of collagen genes showed a different topology (Table 2) which is inconsistent with their having
duplicated concomitantly with members of any other
gene family that we included in the current study.
HOX Linked Paralogous Regions May not Reflect the
Outcome of Ancient Block or Whole Chromosome
Duplication Events
The occurrence of conserved paralogous regions on
human HOX-bearing chromosomes Hsa 2/7/12/17 has
been taken as evidence that these chromosomes are
related by two rounds of block, or whole chromosome
doubling events [8,11,16]. This would imply that constit-

Members of HOX linked gene families that have arisen early in vertebrate history
Members of HOX linked gene families that have arisen early in vertebrate history. Order of branching within phylogenetic
trees was used to estimate the time windows (double headed arrows on the right) of gene duplication events relative to major
cladogenetic events. For each family the lower limit of time window was defined from fish-tetrapod split and the upper limit
from the branching order of available closest invertebrate ancestral sequence (Protostomes: Drosophila, Apis mellifera; Echinoderm: Sea Urchin; Cephalochordates: Amphioxus; Urchordate: Ciona intestinalis, Ciona savignyi). The INHBE, INHBC and
SLC4A8, SLC4A10 genes arose after the fish-tetrapods split. Previously Proposed timing [3-6] of extensive gene duplications
during early chordate evolution is given on the left of the diagram.

uent genes including HOX clusters on each of the relevant
chromosomes are suggestive of the architecture of an
ancestral block (before vertebrate origin) where all of
these genes were linked in a single copy [20].

To test whether the four-fold paralogy seen on human
HOX-bearing chromosomes (Figure 1) is an outcome of
doubling events of a single ancestral block, we employed
the topology comparison approach to check the consist-

encies among the phylogenies of 12 gene families including the HOX clusters. We recovered four independent coduplicated groups involving the members from total 11
gene families. The largest co-duplicated group suggests the
simultaneous duplication of members of five gene families (Figure 9A) where the order and close physical linkage
of constituent genes is largely disrupted, except GLI and
INHB genes which are tightly bound to each other on each
of the relevant chromosomes (Figure 1). The second coduplicated group involves the members from ERBB,
ZNFN1A, and IGFBP families and indicates a conservation of linkage and gene order following co-duplication
events (Figure 9B). The HOX clusters and members of the
SP gene family represent the third co-duplicated group
(Figure 9C); again the constituent genes remained closely
linked on each of the relevant chromosomal segments.
The fourth co-duplicated group involves the members
from two gene families (Figure 9D) where the linkage
between the co-duplicated genes is largely disrupted,
except on Hsa17 where MYL4 is closely linked to ITGB3
gene (Figure 1).
Our results show that extensive triplicate or quadruplicate
synteny that is seen on the present day human HOX-bearing chromosomes is not the outcome of two rounds of
duplications experienced by a single ancestral block.
Instead, our data suggest that those members of HOX

linked gene families that arose within the time window of
proposed block duplication events (Figure 8) can be
divided into distinct co-duplicated groups. Genes within a
particular co-duplicated group share the same evolutionary history and duplicated in concert with each other,
while the genes belonging to different co-duplicated
groups may not share the evolutionary history and may
not have duplicated simultaneously. We conclude that
gene families with three or more members on human
HOX-bearing chromosomes might be the outcome of
gene-cluster duplication events experienced by vertebrates
at different time points in their evolutionary history,
whereas their current triplicate or quadruplicate distribution on these chromosomes might be the consequence of
chromosomal redistribution of multigene family members through extensive rearrangement of genomic segments encompassing multiple contiguous genes. This
would imply that although different co-duplicated groups
within human chromosomes 2, 7, 12 and 17 are remnants
of waves of small-scale duplications (segmental/genecluster) and chromosomal rearrangement events, they do
not indicate a single ancestral block.

12/17 are considered to be shaped directly by two rounds
polyploidy (quadruplication of single ancestral blocks).
Our results show that the constituent gene families of the
HOX cluster paralogon have arisen largely by distinct
duplication events, and their members were brought
together in three or four collinear regions on different
chromosomes (Hsa2, 7, 12 and 17) as a result of rearrangements of genomic segments including multiple contiguous genes, at least as early as before the divergence of
bony fishes and tetrapods. This data suggests that linkage
relationships seen on the human HOX-bearing chromosomes are not an outcome of ancient block or whole chromosome duplications and thus should not be taken as
evidence for two rounds of polyploidization events (2R
hypothesis). This conclusion may have important implications in resolving the controversies about the evolutionary processes that had shaped our own genome.

Methods
Dataset
Genes from 11 families were included in the analysis
(Table 1). The chromosomal location of human gene families was obtained from Ensembl genome browser [21], 8
of these families have members on each of the human
HOX-bearing chromosomes while 3 have their members
on at least three of those chromosomes (Table 1 and Figure 1). Information about the molecular functions (Table
1) of selected gene families was retrieved from GeneReports available at SOURCE [22].

The closest putative orthologous sequences of human
proteins in other species were obtained from Orthologue
Prediction at Ensembl [21]. To enrich these gene families
with sequences from those organisms for which the
sequence information was not available at Ensembl,
BLASTP [23] search was carried out against the protein
database available at National Centre for Biotechnology
Information [24] and the Joint Genome Institute [25].
Because the focus of this study was to identify the duplications events which had occurred during vertebrate evolution, only blast hits giving a higher score than the
sequence of available invertebrate ancestral sequences
were retained. Further confirmation of ancestral-descendents relationship among putative orthologs was done
through clustering of homologous proteins within phylogenetic trees. We excluded sequences whose position
within a tree was sharply in conflict with the uncontested
animal phylogeny. The list of all used sequences is given
as Additional file 1.
The species we chose are Homo sapiens (human), Mus musculus (mouse), Rattus norvegicus (rat), Gallus gallus
(chicken), Macaca mulatta (rhesus monkey), Canis familiaris (dog), Bos taurus (cow), Monodelphis domestica (opossum), Xenopus tropicalis (Frog), Erinaceus europaeus

(hedgehog), Danio rerio (zebrafish), Takifugu rubripes
(Fugu), Tetraodon nigroviridis, Gasterosteus aculeatus (Stickleback), Oryzias latipes (Medaka), Ciona intestinalis (ascidian), Ciona savignyi (ascidian), Branchiostoma floridae
(Amphioxus), Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (sea urchin),
Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly), Apis mellifera (honey
bee), Caenorhabditis elegans (Nematode).
Alignment and Phylogenetic Analysis
Amino acid sequences were aligned by using CLUSTAL W
[26] under default parameters. The alignments were manually refined where necessary. The phylogenetic trees for
each gene family were reconstructed by using the neighbor-joining (NJ) method [27], the complete deletion
option was used to exclude any site which postulated a
gap in the sequences. Poisson corrected (PC) amino acid
distance and uncorrected proportion (p) of amino acid
difference were used as amino acid substitution models.
Because both methods produced similar results, only the
results from NJ tree based on uncorrected p-distance are
presented here. Reliability of the resulting tree topology
was tested by the bootstrap method [28] (at 1000 pseudoreplicates) which generated the bootstrap probability
for each interior branch in the tree.

The phylogenetic trees of seven gene families (COL, ERBB,
IGFBP, ZNFN1A, GLI, HH and INHB) were rooted with
orthologous genes from invertebrates, whereas the SP
phylogeny was rooted with both invertebrate and vertebrate SP8 sequences. The phylogenies of SLC4A and MYL
families consisted of two subfamilies, each of which
served to root the other. For the ITGB tree, vertebrate
ITGB8 sequences served as an outgroup to root the
remainder of the tree, while the remaining sequences
served to root vertebrate ITGB8 sequences.
For each gene family the order of branching within the
phylogenetic tree was used to estimate the time window
for gene duplication events relative to the divergence of
major taxa of organisms. This method of relative dating
does not depend on the assumption of a constant rate of
molecular evolution and is thus robust to differences in
the rate of evolution in different branches of the tree [12].
Tree topology of each gene family was compared with
other families and also with the phylogeny of HOX clusters [19] to test consistencies in duplication events.
