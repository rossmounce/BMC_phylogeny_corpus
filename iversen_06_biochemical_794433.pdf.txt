Abstract
Background: Enterobacter sakazakii is an emergent pathogen that has been associated with
neonatal infections through contaminated powdered infant milk formula. The species was defined
by Farmer et al. (1980) who described 15 biogroups according to the biochemical characterization
of 57 strains. This present study compares genotypes (DNA cluster groups based on partial 16S
rDNA sequence analysis) with the biochemical traits for 189 E. sakazakii strains.
Results: Analysis of partial 16S rDNA sequences gave 4 well defined phylogenetic groups. Cluster
group 1 was composed of the majority of strains (170/189) and included Biogroups 1–5, 7–9, 11,
13 and 14. Cluster 3 corresponded with Biogroup 15 and cluster 4 with Biogroups 6, 10 and 12.
Cluster group 2 comprised a new Biogroup 16. For the isolates in this study, the four DNA cluster
groups can be distinguished using the inositol, dulcitol and indole tests.
Conclusion: This study demonstrates an agreement between genotyping (partial 16S rDNA) and
biotyping and describes a new biogroup of E. sakazakii.

Background
Enterobacter sakazakii is an emergent pathogen that is associated with neonatal infection [1,2]. Most reported outbreaks have occurred in neonatal intensive care units and
some have been linked to the ingestion of contaminated
powdered infant milk formula [3,4].
E. sakazakii was defined as a new species by Farmer et al.
1980. Using DNA-DNA hybridization the previously 'yellow pigmented Enterobacter cloacae' was shown to be 41–
54% related to Enterobacter and Citrobacter species. Farmer
et al. [5] described 15 biogroups of E. sakazakii based on
biochemical profiles with the wild type Biogroup 1 being

the most common. Since 1980 prokaryotic systematics
has changed with the increasing use of 16S rDNA
sequence analysis [6,7]. Harada and Ishikawa [8] used
DNA sequence analysis of the groEL operon to determine
the phylogenetic relationship among Enterobacter, Pantoea, Klebsiella, Serratia and Erwinia species. Hoffmann and
Roggenkamp [9] used hsp60 (groEL homologue) DNA
sequence variation to investigate E. cloacae polyphyletic
groups. Previously, it has been shown by both partial 16S
rDNA and hsp60 gene sequencing that isolates identified
as E. sakazakii using commercial identification kits form at
least four distinct clusters [10]. Recently, an Artificial Neural Network has been published which identified key bio-

chemical and 16S rDNA sequences that distinguish E.
sakazakii from closely related organisms [11].
In this study, we compare the biogroups of 189 strains
with the four 16S rDNA cluster groups. We also identified
key biochemical characteristics for the differentiation of
these four genotypes. This significantly extends the previous work of Farmer et al. [5], which used five strains to
genetically define the species and a total of 57 strains to
define biogroups.

Results
Biogroups
The biochemical profiles obtained for each strain were
compared to the biogroups originally described by Farmer
et al [5]. Clinical strains were distributed among fourteen
of the biogroups (Table 1). The defining tests were motility, Voges-Proskauer, methyl red, indole, ornithine decarboxylase, reduction of nitrate to nitrite, production of gas
from D-glucose, malonate utilization and production of
acid from myo-inositol and dulcitol. Where strains could
not be assigned to an original biogroup, a new biogroup
or subgroup was designated (Table 2). The majority of isolates (60/189) were in Biogroup 1 with the E. sakazakii
ATCC 29544T type strain. These strains were motile, produced gas from glucose, produced acid from inositol,
reduced nitrate and were positive for Voges-Proskauer and
ornithine decarboxylase, but negative for methyl red,
indole, malonate utilization and acid production from
dulcitol. Biogroup 2 (n = 42) contained isolates negative
for acid production from inositol; four of these were also
non-motile. Biogroup 3 (non-motile) contained six
strains and Biogroup 4 (ornithine negative) contained
nine strains three of which were non-motile. Biogroup 5
(n = 16) was positive for malonate utilization and six of
these were non-motile. Biogroup 6 (n = 2) was positive for
indole and Biogroup 7 (n = 4) was negative for gas production from glucose. Biogroup 8 (n = 7) was defined by
the inability to reduce nitrate. Two of these 7 strains were
positive in the malonate test, three were negative for the
inositol test and two were inositol negative but malonate
positive. Biogroup 9 contained 13 strains that were inositol negative and malonate positive. Biogroup 10 contained one strain that was inositol negative and indole
positive, while Biogroup 11 contained one strain that was
inositol negative and dulcitol positive. Biogroup 12 was
also represented by only one strain, which was indole and
malonate positive. The seven isolates in Biogroup 13 were
negative for the Voges-Proskauer reaction, three were nonmotile, one was negative for methyl red and one was negative for ornithine. Biogroup 14 (n = 5) was negative for
ornithine decarboxylase and inositol, with four of these
strains being positive for malonate. Biogroup 15 was positive for all the tests performed except methyl red. A new
group (Biogroup 16) had to be defined to accommodate

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/6/94

9 strains which were inositol and dulcitol positive, but
indole negative. They were malonate positive, with the
exception of one strain. Two strains were non-motile and
one of these was also ornithine decarboxylase negative.
Acid production from α-methyl-D-glucoside was
included in the original study [1] and all biogroups were
reported positive for this trait with the exception of Biogroup 15. As Biogroup 15 could be distinguished from the
other biogroups without the α-methyl-D-glucoside test,
this was not repeated for all strains in this study.
Phylogenetic analysis
Partial 16S rDNA sequences (528 bp) containing less than
1% undetermined positions were obtained for all strains
in this study. The sequences were analysed using the maximum parsimony method, which is an evolutionary
model that searches for the simplest tree that can be constructed using the fewest inferred changes between characters. The topology was optimised using simulated
annealing, a heuristic that occasionally accepts a worse
tree during the course of the search allowing it to escape
local optima. This method is more economical than the
more usual heuristic searches (stepwise addition and hillclimbing), which can require many randon re-starts, especially with large data matrices [12]. In agreement with previous reports [10], the isolates used in this study were
divided into four genomic groups by 16S rDNA sequence
analysis (Fig 1). The majority (170/189) of the presumptive E. sakazakii isolates in this study clustered with the
type strain (Fig. 1E. sakazakii cluster 1). Cluster 1 was composed of the majority of biogroups, Biogroups 1–5, 7–9,
11, 13 and 14. The 9 isolates forming the new proposed
Biogroup 16 corresponded with E. sakazakii cluster 2 (Fig.
1 cluster 2), with between 1.23–1.89% 16S rDNA
sequence difference from the E. sakazakii type strain. No
strains representative of this biochemical profile were
included in the original study by Farmer et al. [5].

The six isolates in Biogroup 15 corresponded to E. sakazakii cluster 3 (Fig. 1 cluster 3). The four strains described as
E. sakazakii cluster 4 (Fig. 1 cluster 4) represent Biogroups
6, 10 and 12. For this dataset, the four partial 16S rDNA
cluster groups can be distinguished biochemically using
the indole, dulcitol, and inositol tests (Table 4). Cluster 1
strains are variable for inositol, negative for indole, and
dulcitol; with the exception of Biogroup 11, which is dulcitol positive and inositol negative. Cluster 2 – Biogroup
16 strains are positive for inositol and dulcitol but negative for indole. Cluster 3 – Biogroup 15 is positive for
inositol, dulcitol and indole. Cluster 4 strains were also
positive for indole but can be distinguished from Cluster
3 as they are negative for dulcitol. One of the strains in
Cluster 4 was inositol negative (Biogroup 10) and one was
malonate positive (Biogroup 12). There were insufficient

isolates in Cluster 4 biogroups to determine whether these
biogroups could be further genomically divided.

Discussion
Farmer et al. [5] described 15 biogroups of 57 strains of E.
sakazakii. Five strains were used to genetically define the
species by DNA-DNA hybridization and the remaining
strain definitions were phenotypic. This study defines isolates in terms of both phenotype and genotype and
extends the initial 1980 [5] study with the analysis of 189
strains. According to partial 16S rDNA sequence analysis
the majority of E. sakazakii strains clustered with the type
strain (Figure 1), and within this cluster there was no clear
further genomic division corresponding to biogroup. A
second cluster of closely related strains was identified
(cluster 2) which were biochemically distinct from cluster
1 and formed a biogroup that had not been previously
described by Farmer et al [5]. These strains were not
assigned a species match using the MicroSeq 500 or supplemental bacterial databases, but the nearest match was
E. sakazakii (1.23–1.89%). Biogroup 15 [5] corresponds
to E. sakazakii cluster 3, while Biogroups 6, 10 and 12 correspond to E. sakazakii cluster 4 [10,11].
Analysis of the full 16S sequence of strains corresponding
to cluster groups 2 (biogroup 16) [13] and 3 (biogroup
15) [14] show these are less than 3% divergent from cluster group 1. Although DNA-DNA hybridization is the
acknowledged standard for species delineation this technique was beyond the scope of this study, which focuses
on evaluation of the biogroups reported when E. sakazakii
was originally described. As well as defining a new bio-

group (with three subgroups), this study found 10 subgroups within the original biogroups. The malonate and
motility tests account for the majority of the subdivisions
of the original biogroups.
In this study, the majority of food isolates belonged to
Biogroups 1 and 2. All biogroups except 10 and 16 contained at least one strain from a clinical source. The greatest number of clinical strains (10 isolates) was found to
belong to Biogroup 9 (Table 1). However, this included 9
isolates out of the ten from the same hospital. Therefore
this may not be an indication of increased pathogenicity
of this biogroup, but is likely due to an over representation of one clonal type from a single source. Most of the
food isolates (including infant foods) belonged to Biogroups 1 and 2.

Conclusion
Biogroup 1 was the major group with approximately one
third of the E. sakazakii strains (60/189). Cluster 1 was the
major DNA cluster (170/189 strains), and was composed
of Biogroups 1–5, 7–9, 11, 13 and 14. Cluster 3 is equivalent to Biogroup 15, and a new Biogroup 16 was designated for the strains in Cluster 2. For this dataset it is
possible to differentiate the four genomic clusters using
indole, dulcitol and inositol tests.

the isolates is given in Table 1. At least one strain from
each of the biogroups described when the E. sakazakii species was designated were included and representative
strains for each biogroup are given in Table 3. The type
strain (NCTC 11467T) was purchased from the NCTC,
London, UK, as were strains NCTC 9844, NCTC 9238 and
NCTC 9846. Strain NCIMB 8272 was purchased from the
NCIMB, Aberdeen, Scotland. Eleven strains, CDC 596070, 1895-73, 0743-75, 3523-75, 9363-75, 9369-75, 040777, 0996-77, 1058-77, 1716-77, and 3128-77 were
donated by the CDC, Atlanta, GA, USA. Strains were also
kindly donated by the following: – Nestlé Research
Center, Lausanne, Switzerland; Health Products and Food
branch, Health Canada; Children's Hospital Los Angeles
CA, USA; Northern Foods, UK; Oxoid Ltd., Basingstoke,
UK; Hospital Cèské Budéjovice, Czech Republic; Institut
fûr Tierärztliche Nahrungsmittelkunde Milchwissenschaften, Justus-Liebig-Universität Gießen, Germany; Nottingham City Hospital Trust, Nottingham, UK and the

Department of Medical Microbiology, Radboud,
Nijmegen, Netherlands. All other strains were food and
environmental isolates from the culture collection at Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, UK.
Phenotypic characterisation
In addition to phenotypes derived from commercial biochemical test kits (Microbact GN2, Oxoid; API 20E and
ID32E, BioMérieux) according to manufacturers' recommendations, the following tests were performed using
conventional manual methods. Motility was determined
at 37°C after 24 and 48 h using motility medium (tryptose 10 g l-1, NaCl 5 g l-1, agar 5 g l-1, pH 7.2 ± 0.2). Acid
production from carbohydrates was tested in phenol red
broth base (10 g l-1 peptone, 1 g l-1 yeast extract, 5 g l-1
NaCl, 0.018 g l-1 phenol red) with the addition of filtersterilized carbohydrate solution (final concentration
0.5%). Gas production from D-glucose was determined
by collection in Durham tubes. Malonate utilization was
