Abstract
Background: The Duffy-binding protein II of Plasmodium vivax (PvDBPII) has been considered as an
attractive target for vaccine-mediated immunity despite a possible highly polymorphic nature.
Among seven PvDBP domains, domain II has been shown to exhibit a high rate of nonsynonymous
polymorphism, which has been suggested to be a potential immune (antibody binding) evasion
mechanism. This study aimed to determine the extent of genetic polymorphisms and positive
natural selection at domain II of the PvDBP gene among a sampling of Thai P. vivax isolates.
Methods: The PvDBPII gene was PCR amplified and the patterns of polymorphisms were
characterized from 30 Thai P. vivax isolates using DNA cloning and sequencing. Phylogenetic
analysis of the sequences and positive selection were done using DnaSP ver 4.0 and MEGA ver 4.0
packages.
Results: This study demonstrated a high rate of nonsynonymous polymorphism. Using Sal I as the
reference strain, a total of 30 point-mutations were observed in the PvDBPII gene among the set of
Thai P. vivax isolates, of which 25 nonsynonymous and five synonymous were found. The highest
frequency of polymorphism was found in five variant amino acids (residues D384G, R390H, L424I,
W437R, I503K) with the variant L424I having the highest frequency. The difference between the
rates of nonsynonymous and synonymous mutations estimated by the Nei and Gojobori's method
suggested that PvDBPII antigen appears to be under selective pressure. Phylogenetic analysis of
PvDBPII Thai P. vivax isolates to others found internationally demonstrated six distinct allele groups.
Allele groups 4 and 6 were unique to Thailand.
Conclusion: Polymorphisms within PvDBPII indicated that Thai vivax malaria parasites are
genetically diverse. Phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences using the Neighbour-Joining method
demonstrated that Thai isolates shared distinct alleles with P. vivax isolates from different
geographical areas. The study reported here will be valuable for the development of PvDBPII-based
malaria vaccine.

Background
Molecular mechanisms of invasion by Plasmodium vivax
merozoites are mediated by the Duffy-binding-like (DBL)
family of homologous erythrocyte binding protein (EBPs)
located within the micronemes of merozoites that recognize specific receptors on red blood cell [1]. PvDBP is a
140-kDa protein belonging to a family of erythrocyte
binding proteins characterized by a functionally conserved cysteine-rich region. The similarity among DBL
families of EBPs is the greatest within two adjacent
cysteine-rich domains, designated as the amino cysteinerich domain (N-cys) and carboxyl cysteine-rich domain
(C-cys) [2]. The amino cysteine-rich domain has been
identified as the principle adhesion region binding to
erythrocyte receptors, while the function of the carboxyl
cysteine-rich domain remains unclear. This aminocysteine-rich domain is present within the 330 amino acid
region II, which has been shown to contain the binding
motifs necessary for adherence to the Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC), required for erythrocyte invasion [3]. Critical binding motifs in PvDBPII have been
mapped to a 170 amino acid spanning region between
cysteines 4 and 7 (amino acids 291–460) [4]. Cysteine
residues are conserved within the identified binding
motif, whereas other amino acids are highly polymorphic,
having a high ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous
mutations [5].
The polymorphic nature of the PvDBP, particularly its
region II (DBPII) is a major impediment to the development of a broadly protective vaccine against vivax malaria.
A study in Papua New Guinea showed 43 and 18 unique
nonsynonymous mutations in 10 Madang [6] and 24
Wosera vivax isolates [7], respectively, whereas 19 unique
nonsynonymous mutations were described in 10 Colombian vivax isolates [8]. Often the mutations were found in
corresponding locations in the protein sequence of isolates from different geographical areas. Amino acids substitutions at D384G, K386(N/Q), N417K, L424I, W437R,
and I503K were found in both Papua New Guinea isolates
and Colombia isolates [5-8]. Such results demonstrate
that many similar alleles are widely distributed among P.
vivax from different geographical areas. Polymorphic patterns in the PvDBP cluster within the critical erythrocytebinding segment imply the existence of a selection pressure on PvDBP [9]. Under the influence of immune pressure, the distribution of existing antigenic polymorphisms
affects the population structure in which newly selected
mutants spread and may provide insight to the evolution
and selection of parasite populations over time [10]. Polymorphisms of PvDBPII require further exploration
among vivax isolates from different geographic areas, particularly south-east Asia where a large proportion of vivax
infections take place. Therefore, the gene polymorphisms

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/7/1/112

within the region II domain of the P. vivax DBP among
Thai P. vivax isolates were investigated.

Methods
P. vivax samples and DNA preparation
Plasmodium vivax isolates were obtained from malaria
patients with informed consent at the outpatient clinic,
Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Bangkok, from May, 2002 to
June, 2003 under a protocol approval by the Ethics Committee, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University.
The confirmation of P. vivax infection was done by microscopic examination of the parasites in thick and thin
blood smears. Approximately 1 ml of venous blood was
collected from each individual in 0.5 M ethylene-diamine
tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) tubes and kept at -20°C until use.
Genomic DNA was extracted from 200 μl of blood using
a High Pure PCR Template Preparation Kit (Roche, Mannhein, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
Genotyping of P. vivax isolates at the PvDBPII locus
P. vivax DBPII gene was amplified by PCR using the oligonucleotide primers, DBPII-F; 5'-CACCACGATCTCTAGTGCTATTATA-3' and DBPII-R; 5'-TGTCACAACTTCCTGAG
TATT-3' [11]. PCR cycling conditions were 94°C for 3
min, 55°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 1 min for 35 cycles followed by a 10 min extension at 72°C. PCR products were
stained with 0.1 μg/ml ethidium bromide and visualized
by digital photography under ultraviolet light. The PCR
products were run adjacently to 0.1 μg/lane of a 2-log
DNA ladder (NewEngland BioLabs, Inc. MA, USA) as a
standard DNA marker.
Purification of PCR products, DNA cloning and DNA
sequencing of PvDBPII gene
PCR products were purified by QIAquick PCR purification
Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. The PCR products were cloned
directly into pCR-Blunt II-TOPO cloning vector using a
Zero Blunt TOPO PCR cloning kit (Invitrogen, La Jolla,
CA). For DNA sequencing of the species-specific amplicons, excess dNTPs and unincorporated primers were
eliminated using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). DNA sequencing was performed
by fluorescence based methodologies using MegaBACE
DNA Analysis Systems (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). The sequences have been submitted to the GenBank under the accession number EF219451, EF368159–
368180, EF379127–379135. Due to the possibility of
multiple genotypes within parasites taken from one individual, direct sequencing was not performed. Instead, at
least five clones were sequenced from each corresponding
PCR product and sequences of these had to be identical to
meet our quality control standards.

Analysis of PvDBPII gene sequences
The alignment of complete sequences of 30 PvDBPII genes
was analysed by Sequencher ver 4.2 software (Gene Code
Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI) [12,13]. Sequences were
aligned using CLUSTALX Multiple Sequence Alignment
Program developed by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI, Bethesda, MD). The percent
similarity was assessed using BLASTN (NCBI, Bethesda,
MD) and BioEdit ver 7.0 software (Tom Hall Isis Therapeutics, Isis Pharmaceuticals, CA), DnaSP ver 4.0 [14] and
MEGA ver 4.0 Beta program [15].
Analysis of natural selection
Evidence of positive natural selection was determined by
comparing the rate of nonsynonymous and synonymous
substitutions in region II of the P. vivax DBP gene. The
rates of substitutions were estimated using the Nei and
Gojobori's method [16] with the Jukes and Cantor correction [17,18] as implemented in the MEGA program.
Standard error was determined by 1000 bootstrap replications. Negative selection acting on most coding genes can
be identified typically when the rate on nonsynonymous
mutations is less than the rate of synonymous mutations
(kn <Ks). However, when positive selection is acting on a
gene, the rate of nonsynonymous mutations will exceed
that of synonymous mutations (kn > Ks). Two other tests
of neutrality were performed by Tajima's D test, Fu and
Li's D- and F-tests on DnaSP 4 software using P. knowlesi
DBP as an outgroup. Tajima's D test compares the estimation of nucleotide diversity calculated in two ways (θ calculated from the number of segregating sites and π
calculated from average pairwise nucleotide diversity) in
order to test for a departure from neutrality. Fu and Li's D
and F test, departures from neutrality are identified as a
deviation between estimates of θ (derived from the
number of mutations in external branches of the phylogeny and from the total number of mutations giving the
index D or from the average pairwise diversity π giving the
index F) [19].
Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic analysis was used to investigate the associations of PvDBPII gene with sequences elucidated from dif-

ferent geographical regions. The gene tree was constructed
using regions common to all available PvDBPII
sequences. Forty five PvDBPII genes sequences found in
GenBank were compiled and compared to Thai isolates
including the sequences from a reference strain, Sal I, one
individual sequence from Vietnam, Indonesia, Brazil and
India as well as 2, 3, 3 and 31 sequences from Bangladesh,
Colombia (COL), South Korea (SK) and Papua New
Guinea (PNG), respectively (Table 1). A phylogenetic tree
was derived from the aligned nucleotide sequences using
the Neighbour-Joining (NJ) method with 1000 bootstrap
replicates, the Tamura's three-parameter distance model
as implemented in the MEGA ver 4.0 Beta program [20].

Results
PCR products and genetic polymorphisms of PvDBPII
gene among Thai isolates
The PCR amplification of the P. vivax DBPII gene from 30
Thai isolates yielded DNA fragments of approximately
990 base pairs in length (Figure 1). A 900 bp was selected
after excluding primer regions and adjacent bases which
did not give uniformly reliable sequences. DNA analysis
in comparison to the PvDBP gene of Sal I reference strain
revealed amino acid polymorphisms across the entire
domain II of PvDBP protein (300 amino acids) among
Thai isolates. Among the 30 polymorphic sites, 29
showed monomorphic mutation (changed into one
amino acid-type) and only a position 386(N/Q) showed
dimorphic mutation (changed into two amino acidtypes) (Table 2). Among 300 amino acids within PvDBPII,
25 nonsynonymous (representing 83% of all isolates) and
five synonymous mutations were identified (Table 2).
High frequencies of variant amino acids (>50%) were
found and included L424I (86%), D384G (76%), W437R
(63%), R390H (56%), and I503K (56%) residue polymorphisms.

Based on the variation of nonsynonymous mutations and
in comparison to Sal I the Thai haplotyes were designated
as TA (TA1-TA25). TA1, TA5 and TA11 haplotypes were
identified in two isolates while TA17 was identified in
three isolates. The other 21 haplotypes were identified in
single isolates (Table 3). The cluster analysis of PvDBPII

groups (Figure 2).
Evidence of natural selection
To investigate whether natural selection contributed to
generation of this diversity, the ratio of nonsynonymous
(Kn) to synonymous substitutions (Ks) was compared
between Thai and Sal I isolates. The number of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous sites (Kn)
(0.00956) exceeded the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous sites (Ks) (0.00754). The Kn/Ks
ratio was 1.270 predicting that positive selection may be
occurring in region II of DBP favouring the fixation of
amino acid replacement in certain areas of the protein.
The statistic tests detecting departure from neutrality
showed evidence that the observed polymorphism might
be trending natural selection. Tajima's D value was 0.084549 with P > 0.10. The Fu and Li, D and F values

respectively.
Phylogenetic tree of PvDBPII
Phylogenetic tree analysis of DNA sequences derived from
region II of the P. vivax DBP constructs based on the
Neighbour-Joining method using Tamura's three-parameter distance is shown in Figure 3. Variation of DNA
sequence was categorized into nine distinct alleles groups.
Thai isolates were widely distributed amongst groups 1, 3,
5 and 7 also containing isolates from different geographical regions. PvDBPII DNA sequence of Thai isolates was
related to isolates sets from Papua New Guinea and India
(group 1), Korea (group 3), Colombia (group 5) and a
second Papua New Guinea set (group 7). The Sal I reference strain used in this study was included in group 2
composed of isolates from Colombia, Korea, Bangladesh,
Indonesia, and Vietnam, but bootstrap analysis demonstrated that the Thai isolates were distinct from this group.
Most isolates from Papua New Guinea formed a distinctive group comprised of 8 and 9.

Discussion
The process invasion into erythrocyte is essential for survival of P. vivax parasite and requires DBP to bind the
Duffy blood group antigen that act as erythrocyte receptor, Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC). Plasmodium vivax utilizes genetic diversity of individual
functional proteins to evade the host immune system and
resist many anti-malarial drugs [21]. In this study, polymorphisms and natural selection was assessed and suggested positive natural selection in PvDBPII of Thai
isolates. Although, non significant could be observed
trending positive selection. As this is only a glimpse at the

Analysis of 300 amino acids of PvDBPII protein relative to
the Sal I reference strain, resulted in 25 nonsynonymous
mutations being found. In addition, 142 nonsynonymous
mutations were reported in 76 Papua New Guinea isolates
[22]. The nonsynonymous mutations in PvDBPII might
have an effect on parasite binding to erythrocyte receptors.
Nonsynonymous mutations often times result in amino
acid substitutions that alter charge and therefore host
immune/antibody recognition [6]. Thus, excessive stable
polymorphism generation within the PvDBPII ligand
domain from high rate of nonsynonymous polymorphisms may promote the parasite escape of host immune
response [9].

D384G (85%) in Brazil isolates [23]. Of the following variants N417K, W437R and I503K, all having been shown
to be involved in evasion to antibody neutralization, variant N417K was found in low frequency (36%) while
W437R and I503K were high (63% and 56% respectively)

Malaria Journal 2008, 7:112

frequency of variant I503K (55%) found in Brazil and low
frequencies of all three variants (N417K, W437R, I503K)
found in either Colombia (47%, 18%, 12%, respectively)
and/or Papua New Guinea (23%, 26%, 29%, respectively)
(Table 4) [23]. N417K, W437R and I503K have recently
been shown to not be directly involved in erythrocyte
binding, but possibly in inhibition of antibody binding to
erythrocyte receptor [24]. Moreover, the variant amino
acid T404R was identified in PvDBPII domains of three
Thai isolates (Table 2) which is similar to the recent data
in Papua New Guinea [22]. Other Thai variants, namely
R308S, K371E, D384G, E385K, N386(N/Q), R390H,
T404R, N417K, L424I, W437R, S447S and I503K, were
also found in isolates of other regions, demonstrating
commonality with a progenitor clone (Table 4). The other
18 polymorphic residues of PvDBPII ligand domain were
recognized only among Thai isolates, indicative of divergence from a progenitor clone.
The study showed that 25 PvDBPII haplotypes clustered
into five main groups (dominant haplotypes) (Table 3)
on the basis of nonsynonymous mutations is similar, but
not entirely the same, with data from Papua New Guinea
isolates whose 27 different PvDBPII haplotypes clustering
into three dominant PvDBPII haplotypes. Potentially
dominant PvDBPII haplotypes observed in these populations could be less immunogenic, thereby may help promoting parasite success and escaping the host immune
response [22].
Phylogenetic analysis of PvDBPII suggested that Thai isolates fell into 6 different alleles groups. Among these,
group 1 formed a group with a subset of Papua New
Guinea isolates. Groups 4 and 6 were unique among Thai
P. vivax isolates. However, the rest of the allele groups that
Thai isolates fell into were more related to the isolates
from Korea, India, and Colombia than from Papua New
Guinea (Figure 3). The observations derived from the
PvDBPII phylogeny suggested that single Indian isolate
found in group 1 appeared to share a common ancestor
close to a subset of Thai and Papua New Guinea isolates,
demonstrating common ancestoral origins. Thai and
Papua New Guinea isolate subsets in group 7 also may
have shared common ancestor heritage. Recently, it was

reported that travellers' malaria among foreigners at the
Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Bangkok, Thailand including India and Papua New Guinea patients were though to
have acquired their infections in their countries. Malaria
importations from country to country can occur by either
immigration or travel, and changing malaria attack rates
in the countries of exposure are likely to influence the
incidence of imported disease [25]. Additionally, these
results demonstrated that there is some difference in the
nucleotide or amino acid variation in PvDBPII among isolates from Thai, Korea, India, Papua New Guinea and
Colombia, but most importantly, unique variants from
Thailand do exist and should be considered in future vaccine development of PvDBPII. It should be noted that the
present highly diverse phylogenetic tree was constructed
relying on polymorphisms within a single gene, demonstrating the high degree of topological variation that can
be found using this technique, but also highlighting the
problems that can be associated with gene sampling in
phylogenetic studies [26]. Use of a combination of several
genes with different rates of evolutions has been suggested
as an efficient way to overcome this difficulty to prove the
existence of a unique tree relating these sequences [27].
Finally, it must also be pointed out that in many situations a single-gene phylogeny may be interesting in itself.
Awareness of the problems of orthology (genes in different species that derive from a common ancestor) assignment and tree reconstruction artifacts should be
considered.

Conclusion
The results indicated that PvDBPII gene among Thai isolates is genetically diverse. Nonsynonymous polymorphism in PvDBPII was the predominant result of which
variant L424I showed the highest frequency (86%). Five
dominant PvDBPII haplotypes could be clustered among
Thai isolates. The high frequency of polymorphisms and
the presence of distinct alleles within PvDBPII gene
among P. vivax from different geographical areas could
provide complication in malaria vaccine development,
but should be considered important parts of the development process.
