Mesozoic fossils (>145 Mya) suggest the antiquity
of the subgenera of Daphnia and their
coevolution with chaoborid predators
Alexey A Kotov1* and Derek J Taylor2

Abstract
Background: The timescale of the origins of Daphnia O. F. Mueller (Crustacea: Cladocera) remains controversial.
The origin of the two main subgenera has been associated with the breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea. This
vicariance hypothesis is supported by reciprocal monophyly, present day associations with the former
Gondwanaland and Laurasia regions, and mitochondrial DNA divergence estimates. However, previous multilocus
nuclear DNA sequence divergence estimates at < 10 Million years are inconsistent with the breakup of Pangaea.
We examined new and existing cladoceran fossils from a Mesozoic Mongolian site, in hopes of gaining insights
into the timescale of the evolution of Daphnia.
Results: We describe new fossils of ephippia from the Khotont site in Mongolia associated with the JurassicCretaceous boundary (about 145 MYA) that are morphologically similar to several modern genera of the family
Daphniidae, including the two major subgenera of Daphnia, i.e., Daphnia s. str. and Ctenodaphnia. The daphniid
fossils co-occurred with fossils of the predaceous phantom midge (Chaoboridae).
Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the main subgenera of Daphnia are likely much older than previously
known from fossils (at least 100 MY older) or from nuclear DNA estimates of divergence. The results showing cooccurrence of the main subgenera far from the presumed Laurasia/Gondwanaland dispersal barrier shortly after
formation suggests that vicariance from the breakup of Pangaea is an unlikely explanation for the origin of the
main subgenera. The fossil impressions also reveal that the coevolution of a dipteran predator (Chaoboridae) with
the subgenus Daphnia is much older than previously known – since the Mesozoic.

Background
The timescale of the evolution of some of the most successful freshwater microcrustacean groups such as copepods and cladocerans is poorly known or controversial.
Both groups are comprised of small and often fragile
species, whose fossilized body parts might easily be
overlooked. Copepods appear be predisposed to weak
fossilization as they are extremely rare in the subfossil
and fossil record and apparently only preserved under
very unusual circumstances such as oil seeps [1]. Tasch
[2], however, reasoned (after conducting drying experiments of cladocerans on pond mud) that body parts of
cladocerans should be well-preserved in freshwater

sediments. Of course, the subfossils of cladoceran ephippia (modified moulting exuviae containing resting eggs)
and heavily chitinized body parts are common in lacustrine sediments – fossilized cladoceran resting eggs had
already been reported by 1968 from the Pliocene, the
Miocene and the Eocene [3-6]. Tasch [2] “hunted thoroughly” for cladoceran fossils without success in Paleozoic freshwater sediments and later predicted that
cladocerans probably arose during the Mesozoic. Proposals of Paleozoic records of cladocerans [7] turned out
to be of non-cladoceran origin [8], supporting Tasch’s
hypothesis of a later origin for cladocerans. Later,
authentic Mesozoic cladoceran fossils were discovered
from several sites [8-14].
Still, for the cladoceran genus Daphnia O. F. Muller,
1785 (Cladocera: Anomopoda), there is a lack of reliable
calibration points from either geographic or from fossil

evidence. The present day geographic domination of former Gondwanaland regions by the subgenus Daphnia
(Ctenodaphnia) Dybowski et Grochowski, 1895 and of
former Laurasian regions by the subgenus Daphnia
(Daphnia), and the reciprocal monophyly of each subgenus [15-17] could indicate an ancient vicariance event in
the early Cretaceous [18,19]. But, the north-south hemispheric dichotomy of the subgenera in extant Daphnia
is unapparent in the sparse fossil record – every Cenozoic record with fossilized ephippia from the northern
hemisphere reports Ctenodaphnia-like fossils (China,
Germany, Spain, and USA) [4,20,21]. Moreover, Daphnia ephemeralis (Schwartz et Hebert, 1985), the oldest
member of the presumed Gondwanaland clade [15,17] is
restricted to former Laurasia. The oldest fossils of the
subgenus Daphnia are known from the northern hemisphere only at the German Lake Messel site (Eocene)
where fossils of Ctenodaphnia are also recorded. Smirnov [11] assigned impression fossils of Mesozoic ephippia to the genus Daphnia (or “Daphnia-type”), but the
subgenus was unassigned.
A deeper understanding of the timescale of daphniid
evolution has implications beyond biogeography and
systematics. Daphniids have become the model taxon
for ecological genomics and the evolution of inducible
defenses [22-24]. The best studied inducible defenses
involve responses of daphniids to chemical cues resulting from predation by the phantom midge larvae (Chaoboridae) [25]. Numerous phenotypic responses
(morphology, life-history, and behavior) have been
reported from daphniids. Initial studies indicate that
genomic control of inducible defenses is polygenic and
complex [23,26,27], with a majority of responsive genes
having no known homologs [23]. Indeed species of both
major subgenera of Daphnia appear to possess complex
genomic adaptations to predation by chaoborids [24,25].
The phantom midge family (Chaoboridae) has an excellent Mesozoic fossil record in Asian lake fossil beds
with thousands of specimens known from at least five
locations [28]. Does the timescale of co-evolution
between Daphnia and phantom midges extend to the
Mesozoic?
Without reliable independent calibrations, molecular
estimates of the divergence of Daphnia have also been
predictably conflicting. In general, estimates from mitochondrial genes appear consistent with a Mesozoic origin of the subgenera [17,29-31]. Nuclear estimates of
divergence, however, have been dramatically lower than
estimates from mitochondrial genes, a phenomenon that
has been attributed to differences in the effective population sizes and responses to selection for the respective
genomes. Nuclear DNA estimates of divergence based
on observed mutation rates of Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans have yielded divergence times at 7.6

Page 2 of 9

MY for the subgenera of Daphnia [32]. This young estimate of divergence requires that the mitochondrial
DNA estimates and the conclusions of Richter and
Wedmann [6], who assigned damaged ephippia from
fish coprolites in Eocene deposits (about 47 Myr) to
Daphnia (Daphnia) pulex and Daphnia (Ctenodaphnia)
magna, to be spurious [33].
More evidence is needed to resolve the existing profound disagreements of the timescale of evolution for
the genus Daphnia. Importantly, the ephippium has
been identified as possessing important diagnostic characters for the subgenera [19]. In Daphnia (Daphnia) the
ephippium is sub-triangular in shape (because the anterior half of the ephippium is deeper than the posterior
half), with axes of two eggs perpendicular or sub-perpendicular to the dorsal margin (Figure 1a-b). In contrast, the ephippium of D. (Ctenodaphnia) Dybowski &
Grochowski, 1895 is usually D-shaped, with the axes of
eggs being sub-parallel to dorsal margin (Figure 1c-e).
The third subgenus, D. (Australodaphnia) Colbourne,
Wilson et Hebert, 2006 represented now only by a single species, Daphnia occidentalis Benzie, 1986, has only
a single egg in the ephippium [34]. We note that some
extant Ctenodaphnia (Figure 2a-b) and all other daphniid genera, i.e. Simocephalus (Figure 2c-d) also have a
single large egg in the ephippium.
Inspired by the relatively undamaged impression fossils of ephippia reported by Smirnov [11] from Mesozoic
Mongolian sediments, we examined existing and new
samples from this site. We report that there is fossil evidence for an ancient Mesozoic divergence of the subgenera of Daphnia. The evidence extends the age of the
subgenera by about 100 MY from existing fossils and by
about 138 MY from nDNA mutation rate estimates.
Further, the co-occurrence of fossils from the subgenera
and from chaoborids indicates a coevolutionary history
of predator and prey taxa that also dates to the
Mesozoic.

length = 0.59 and 0.63), with an almost straight dorsal
margin. The caudal needle or spine is missing and there
is a widely rounded antero-dorsal and postero-dorsal
angle (Figure 3a). The dorsal portion of the ephippium
is a non-reticulated, heavily-chitinized plate (Figure 3b).
Much of the ephippial surface has inflated reticulation
(Figure 3c). The axes of the two eggs are almost perpendicular to the dorsal margin.

2048 (1); 4307/2049 (2).
Description. Length 0.97-1.17 mm. The ephippia have
a varying relative height (height/length = 0.50-0.69),
with a dorsal plate, and axes of eggs parallel to the dorsal margin. We found size differences among the ephippia of Daphnia (Ctenodaphnia), but the material is too
scarce to designate species. Larger ephippia usually have
a widely rounded antero-dorsal angle and a distinct caudal needle at the postero-dorsal angle. The surface has a
well-developed sculpture, with patterns varying among
individuals (Figures 3d-f, 4a-c). In contrast, the smaller
ephippia have acute antero-dorsal and postero-dorsal
angles lacking a caudal needle and surface sculpturing
(Figure 4d).
Daphniidae gen. sp. 1

Material examined. 4307/2009 (1).
Redescription. Length 1.02 mm. The ephippium is
high, with a slightly convex dorsal margin, a widely
rounded anterior margin and a triangular posterior margin (Figure 4e). The entire surface is covered with
dorso-ventral striation. The axis of a single egg is
located parallel to the dorsal margin, and the egg chamber occupies about half of the ephippium length.
Comments. This ephippium was named “of Moinatype” by Smirnov [11], but the generic determination is
uncertain. Most probably, this is a daphniid ephippium,
but a very primitive one. Recent species of Moina have
ephippia with well-developed sculpture of different types
[5]. In contrast, the ephippium from fragment 4307/
2009 is only striated. Other daphniids, namely Ceriodaphnia and some species of Daphnia (Ctenodaphnia)
(see Figure 2a-b) lay monoegged ephippia (in the case of
Daphnia they are sometimes lacking a caudal needle or
spine). So, the generic position of this ephippium is
unclear.
Simocephalus sp

Material examined. 4307/2026 (1); 4307/2042 (1).
Redescription. The ephippium is elongated, with a
straight dorsal margin, a widely rounded anterior margin

Page 4 of 9

and a fluently narrowing posterior portion. The surface
is finely reticulated (Figure 4f). The axis of a single,
elongated egg is located parallel to the dorsal margin.
The egg chamber occupies more than 2/3 of ephippium
length. Length: 1.02 and 1.10 mm.
Comments. The ephippium from fragment 4307/2026
was justifiably named “of Simocephalus-type” by Smirnov [11], indeed, it is quite similar to the ephippia of
recent species from this genus (Figure 2c-d). Among
daphniids, the ephippium of Simocephalus is quite
unique in possessing a fluently narrowing posterior portion and a large, elongated resting egg [35]. Although
ephippia of recent species normally have well-developed
sculpturing, weak sculpturing of the Mesozoic ephippia
could be an artefact of impression fossil formation or of
among-species variation.

Discussion
Our finding of ephippia from the Khotont site that are
morphologically similar to the common subgenera of
Daphnia, D. (Daphnia) and D. (Ctenodaphnia), indicates
that these two subgenera potentially existed at the J-K
boundary (at least 145 Mya). Our results also confirm
the finding of Smirnov [11] that additional daphniid
genera (i.e. Simocephalus) are present at this boundary.
The fossils of Khotont likely extend the fossil record of
the subgeneric divergence of Daphnia by about 100 MY.
The detection of the subgenus Ctenodaphnia in the
northern hemisphere during the J-K boundary poses a
problem for the hypothesis of vicariance by the break
up of the supercontinent Pangaea. The continental
breakup had occurred by 155 MYA forming Laurasia
and Gondwana, but the two lineages apparently cooccurred far from the presumed dispersal barrier in
northern Laurasia by about 145 MYA. Under the “out
of Gondwanaland” requirement for the current vicariance hypothesis, the subgenus Ctenodaphnia would
have had to breach a more severe oceanic dispersal barrier than contributed to initial speciation, and colonize
the most distant continent from Gondwanaland. This
requires the unlikely transcontinental dispersal before
the major dispersal vector of daphniids (modern birds)
had evolved. Instead, the current fossil and phylogenetic
evidence indicates that the break up of Pangaea is not
associated with the origins of the main subgenera of
Daphnia. Ctenodaphnia and Daphnia appear to have
had a presence in Laurasia since the early Mesozoic
(Figure 5). Ctenodaphnia are known from throughout
much of the present northern hemisphere and one of
the northern endemics, Daphnia ephemeralis, is likely
the oldest known member of the Ctenodaphnia, with a
basal position in the Ctenodaphnia phylogeny. D. ephemeralis also has a primitive morphology for the subgenus with the female having: (1) a very thick, almost

rounded body; (2) no caudal needle in adults; (3) a
rounded fornix; (4) a weakly developed rostrum; and (5)
no posterior mid-line depression on the head shield and,
as a result, a W-shape of the dorsocephalic suture (see
[19] for terminology). Ctenodaphnia fossils have been
found from the Pliocene of Nevada, USA, the Miocene of
Spain, the Pliocene, Oligocene and Eocene of China, the
Eocene of Germany, and here from the Mesozoic of
Mongolia (Figure 5). No fossil Ctenodaphnia species are
yet known from former Gondwanaland. Although the
geographic distribution of known fossils and “basal” species appears inconsistent with Gondwanaland origins for

Ctenodaphnia, the role of extinction and differential fossilization in the formation of these patterns is unknown.
It is clear that the age of our new fossils together with
existing fossil evidence makes the hypothesis of Pangaearelated vicariance less likely.
Our results provide a case where both molecular dating (save the mtDNA estimates) and current biogeography appear to have been misleading regarding the
timescale of evolution. Haag et al. [32] discuss potential
reasons (error associated with estimates of mutation
rate, number of generations per year, and population
subdivision) for discrepancies between their nDNA

dating and the existing mtDNA clock estimates (and
now fossil estimates). The dominance of the southern
hemisphere by the Ctenodaphnia when most Daphnia
appear capable of among-continent dispersal remains a
mystery. Presently, species of Daphnia s. str. prefer large
lakes, while members of D. (Ctenodaphnia) occur most
often in small temporary water bodies (although there
are exceptions from this general rule). If this preference
evolved early in the differentiation of the subgenera, the
greater preference for non-lacustrine and temporary
habitats in the Ctenodaphnia compared to Daphnia
combined with priority effects are plausible explanations
for the differential success of Ctenodaphnia in the

southern hemisphere (see also [17]). In the large Mesozoic lake Khotont both subgenera were found together.
But this finding does not mean that they cooccurred in
a stable fashion. We cannot rule out the possibility that
ephippia were introduced from the surrounding (permanent or temporary) lentic water bodies during some
high water periods, or by some lotic waters. Most commonly, the contents of such small water bodies are not
fossilised – we have palaeontological information from
cladocerans largely from lakes.
We assumed that ephippial characters that represent
subgenera of extant species also reflect the same subgenera in Mesozoic taxa. However, it is plausible that

ephippial characters from extant subgenera are nondiagnostic in Mesozoic taxa. A scenario of independent
origins for ephippial characters or ancestral polymorphisms might result in Mesozoic ephippia being
uninformative for subgeneric reconstruction. However,
the multiple origins of characters requires more evolutionary steps than character stability, and the ancestral
polymorphisms scenario requires presumably independent diagnostic characters (shape and egg axis characters) to sort together. Ideally, more characters will be
found from Mesozoic fossils of Daphnia that might
address the hypothesis of evolutionary stability for
diagnostic ephippial characters. Numerous cladocerans
lacking an ephippium are reported for the same locality, namely, extinct prochydorids of three different
species [11,14] and a single antenna II of an undetermined ctenopod [12]. However, no complete adult or
body part beyond ephippia is known from the daphniids of Khotont. The fact of poor preservation of

daphniids compared to other cladocerans in bottom
deposits is well-known [10]. Recently Richter and Baszio [36] demonstrated that the fine structure of Eocene
daphniids, including limb structure, could be studied
from fish coprolites – a type of fossil that is presently
unknown from the Khotont. It seems clear that
impression fossils yield well-preserved ephippia, but
intact daphniid specimens will probably be best sought
in fish coprolites from Mesozoic localities.
Remarkably, daphniids in Lake Khotont were found
together with numerous (587 impressions were found)
fossils of the dipteran (Chaoboridae) predator of daphniids [37,38]. Our results provide evidence that the phenotypic array of inducible defenses in Daphnia is more
than a rapidly evolved response to predation. This
important predator-prey group has been coevolving in
freshwater for at least 145 MY. We expect that the antiquity of daphniidchaoborid coevolution will be reflected
in both predator and host genomes.

Conclusions
Our findings indicate that the main subgenera of Daphnia could be much older than previously known from
fossils (at least 100 MY older) or from nuclear DNA
estimates of divergence. However, the results showing
co-occurrence of the main subgenera far from the presumed Laurasia/Gondwanaland dispersal barrier shortly
after formation suggests that vicariance from the
breakup of Pangaea is an unlikely explanation for the
origin of the main subgenera. The fossil impressions
also reveal that the coevolution of a dipteran (Chaoboridae) predator with the subgenus Daphnia has been
occurring much longer than previously known – since
the Mesozoic.
Methods
Numerous limestone fragments were collected in the
northern slope of Ukha Mount, 6 km W of Somon
Khotont, Ara-Khangay Aymag (=Region) of Mongolia
by the Expedition of the Palaeontological Institute of
Russian Academy of Sciences (PIN) in 1980. Fragments
from Khotont were taxonomically identified by the
staff of PIN. Relative dating based on the examination
of several thousand index fossils of insects (dipteran
insects, for example, were represented by 948 impressions), assigned the present fragments to the Jurassic/
Cretaceous boundary [38] at about 145 Mya. Some cladocerans from this locality have been previously studied [11,12,14].
For the present work, fourteen limestone fragments
with 24 comparatively clear impressions of daphniid
ephippia, seen by Smirnov [11] or subsequently found
on fragments with other animal impressions, were
selected. Micrographs were taken using the scanning
electron microscope CAM SCAN MB2300 after coating
with gold.
