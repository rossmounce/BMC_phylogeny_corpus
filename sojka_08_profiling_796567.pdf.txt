Abstract
Background: Ticks are vectors for a variety of viral, bacterial and parasitic diseases in human and
domestic animals. To survive and reproduce ticks feed on host blood, yet our understanding of the
intestinal proteolytic machinery used to derive absorbable nutrients from the blood meal is poor.
Intestinal digestive processes are limiting factors for pathogen transmission since the tick gut
presents the primary site of infection. Moreover, digestive enzymes may find practical application
as anti-tick vaccine targets.
Results: Using the hard tick, Ixodes ricinus, we performed a functional activity scan of the peptidase
complement in gut tissue extracts that demonstrated the presence of five types of peptidases of
the cysteine and aspartic classes. We followed up with genetic screens of gut-derived cDNA to
identify and clone genes encoding the cysteine peptidases cathepsins B, L and C, an asparaginyl
endopeptidase (legumain), and the aspartic peptidase, cathepsin D. By RT-PCR, expression of
asparaginyl endopeptidase and cathepsins B and D was restricted to gut tissue and to those
developmental stages feeding on blood.
Conclusion: Overall, our results demonstrate the presence of a network of cysteine and aspartic
peptidases that conceivably operates to digest host blood proteins in a concerted manner.
Significantly, the peptidase components of this digestive network are orthologous to those
described in other parasites, including nematodes and flatworms. Accordingly, the present data and
those available for other tick species support the notion of an evolutionary conservation of a
cysteine/aspartic peptidase system for digestion that includes ticks, but differs from that of insects
relying on serine peptidases.

Ticks are important vectors of infectious agents causing
diseases in human and domestic animals [1]. The castor
bean tick Ixodes ricinus transmits Lyme disease caused by
Borrelia burgdorferi spirochetes and tick borne encephalitis
caused by the tick-borne encephalitis virus [2].
Blood-feeding and -digestion are essential activities for
ticks. Blood provides a rich source of proteins and nutrients for anabolic processes such as vitellogenesis and egg
production [3]. Unlike other blood-feeding arthropods,
ticks are believed to digest blood intracellularly – in the
endo/lysosomal vesicles of gut cells [4] at pH values well
below the pH 6.3 – 6.5 of the gut contents [5,6]. Digestive
gut cells use both receptor-mediated and fluid-phase
endocytoses to uptake the liquid blood meal from the gut
lumen [7]. Lara et al. [8] showed that the digestive cells of
Boophilus microplus have separated endocytic pathways for
two major proteins of host blood – serum albumin and
hemoglobin. The requirement for receptor-mediated
endocytosis might be directly linked to the detoxification
of released heme groups during intracellular digestion of
hemoglobin. Most of the toxic heme forms a unique type
of heme aggregate ultimately accumulated inside specialized organelles called hemosomes [9]. The virtual absence
of extracellular digestive enzymes in ticks enables the gut
lumen to serve as a major storage organ [4].
In spite of the above studies, our understanding of the
molecular proteolytic machinery involved in digesting
host proteins in the tick gut is still rather fragmented. Previous studies have tended to focus on individual enzymes
in particular species; all however, have identified either
cysteine or aspartic peptidases; e.g., a cysteine class cathepsin L in B. microplus [10], two forms of a cathepsin L in
Haemaphysalis longicornis [11] and the aspartic peptidase,
cathepsin D (termed longepsin) in H. longicornis [12].
Also, cysteine-class asparaginyl endopeptidases (AE, legumains) have been characterized in I. ricinus [13] and H.
longicornis [14].
The data thus far from different tick species raise the
hypothesis that tick intestinal digestion relies on an evolutionarily conserved network of cysteine and aspartic
peptidases characterized in other parasites, including
platyhelminths [15,16] and nematodes [17]. It comprises
mainly cysteine peptidases cathepsin B, L, C, asparaginyl
endopeptidase/legumain and an aspartic peptidase cathepsin D. To address this hypothesis we focused on a
defined feeding phase of a single tick species, namely partially engorged females of I. ricinus. Two-pronged profiling strategy involving biochemical assays and PCR-based
cloning displayed a simultaneous expression and activity
of the above listed peptidase types in the tick digestive tissue. An improved global insight increases the possibilities

for practical interventions involving vaccines and offers a
better understanding of vector-pathogen interactions at
the primary interface, namely the tick gut.

Results
Functional profiling of multiple peptidase activities in the
gut of I. ricinus
Gut tissue extract prepared from partially engorged I. ricinus females (5th day of feeding) was tested on degradation of the biologically relevant substrate hemoglobin.
Proteolysis was analyzed using a fluorescence assay incorporating AMC-hemoglobin. Optimal proteolysis was
measured at acidic pH between 3.0 and 4.5 (Fig. 1). No
substantial degradation occurred above pH 6.0. At optimum pH (~4.0), hemoglobinolytic activity was inhibited
by the small molecule inhibitors E64 and pepstatin that
selectively target cysteine and aspartic peptidases, respectively. A combined application of both compounds
resulted in nearly complete blockage of the activity (~97%
inhibition), the individual treatment showed about 80%
inhibition (~83% and ~78% for E64 and pepstatin,
respectively). In contrast, inhibitors of serine peptidases
and metallopeptidases Pefabloc and EDTA, respectively,
were ineffective (data not shown).

Next, we focused on dissecting the major component
peptidases in gut extracts responsible for the acidic degradation of blood meal using peptidase selective substrates
and inhibitors (Fig. 2). At pH 4.0, hydrolytic activity cleavRelative hemoglobinolytic activity (%)

Thus, five significant endo- and exopeptidase activities of

Activity 2
Activity profiling of I. ricinus gut peptidases. Peptidolytic activities in the gut tissue extract of partially engorged
tick females (the 5-th day of feeding) were demonstrated in
vitro with selective peptide substrates (structure of the fluorogenic substrates is indicated). The activity for individual substrates was suppressed in the presence of selective peptidase
inhibitors to obtain diagnostic responses indicative of a protease type. Values are expressed as percent inhibition of the
control activities. The identified major activities (Target) correspond to papain-type peptidases cathepsin B, L and C
(CathB, CathL and CathC, respectively), cathepsin D-like
aspartic peptidase (CathD) and asparaginyl endopeptidase
(AE). The assay was performed at pH 4.0, an optimum pH for
hemoglobin degradation by the gut extract. The activity of
AE and CathL was measured in the presence of CA-074
inhibitor to prevent an interference with the activity of
CathB. The error bars indicate standard deviations of the
mean of triplicates.

inhibitor, CA-074. Likewise, activity against Z-Phe-ArgAMC was inhibited 90% by Z-Phe-Phe-DMK. Dipeptidyl
peptidase activity of cathepsin C was measured with GlyArg-AMC and inhibited > 95% by Gly-Phe-DMK. Asparaginyl endopeptidase activity as measured with Z-Ala-AlaAsn-AMC was inhibited > 95% by the azapeptide, Aza-N-

Genetic screening of gut tissue identifies cDNAs encoding
one aspartic and four cysteine peptidases
Single stranded cDNA derived from the gut of I. ricinus
was used as a template for identification and cloning of
genes encoding cysteine and aspartic peptidase precursors. Based on results of the functional screening of peptidase activities, multiple protein and cDNA alignments
were performed to identify conserved domains in cathepsins B, L, D and C as shown for the schistosomal orthologues in Table 1. Degenerate primers derived from these
motifs are listed together with expected PCR product
lengths, optimal annealing temperatures, number of
sequenced clones and number of identified isoforms
(Table 1). Two isoforms of cathepsin B and one form each
of cathepsins L, C and D were identified.

Hybridization screening of the gut cDNA library with
radio-labeled PCR amplicons had been previously used to
obtain the full-length coding sequence for IrAE [13]. Here
the same approach succeeded in identifying full length
cDNA sequences for cathepsins B, L and D. The full cDNA
sequence of cathepsin C was generated by overlapping
PCR, 5' and 3' RACE PCR fragments.
For the sake of consistency, we adopted a nomenclature
for these enzymes previously used for schistosomal peptidases [15,18] – a nomenclature already applied to the I.
ricinus asparaginyl endopeptidase (IrAE) [13]. Thus, we
designated the novel peptidases as IrCB for cathepsin B
(form 1), IrCL for cathepsin L, IrCC for cathepsin C and
IrCD for cathepsin D.

The three clan CA cysteine peptidases, namely IrCB, IrCL
and IrCC could be clearly classified using multiple
sequence alignments followed by a phylogenetic analysis

the IrCD sequence revealed the closest relation (55%

Cathepsin L is another member of the papain family of
peptidases that we have identified from I. ricinus guts (Fig.

I. ricinus cathepsin C (IrCC)
Cathepsin C belongs to the clan CA papain family, but
unlike B and L it acts solely as an exopeptidase. It has been
shown to sequentially remove dipeptides from the substrate N-terminus (therefore alternatively named as dipep-

tidyl peptidase I). The cDNA sequence of IrCC [GenBank:
EU128750] is 1597 bp long and encodes an enzyme precursor of 465 AA residues (Fig. 6). Calculated molecular
weight of the proenzyme without signal peptide is 49.812
Da and the theoretical isoelectric point is 6.88. Based on
the structure of human cathepsin C, the active site residues are Q250, C256, H409 and N431. The predicted signal
peptide counts for 20 AA residues and the proenzyme has
four potential N-glycosylation sites, one close to the predicted mature N-terminus.

abundantly present in all developmental stages including
eggs (Fig. 8A). In contrast, messages for IrCB and IrCD
were absent from tick eggs. No apparent differences were
observed for any enzyme expression between un-fed and

partially engorged, it is possible to reliably dissect individual organs of females for RT-PCR tissue profiling (Fig. 8B)

feeding period [7] what indicates their simultaneous
action in a putative cascade or network. Moreover, IrCB,

Discussion

Initial activity profiling of I. ricinus gut extracts using a
biologically relevant protein substrate (AMC hemoglobin) indicated that hemoglobinolysis is optimal at acid
pH, a finding in accordance with data presented for other
tick species [5,23,24]. This suggested that proteolysis is
mediated by peptidases belonging to the aspartic and/or
cysteine peptidase classes which are known to operate
optimally at acid pH [25]. This conclusion was further
supported by the sensitivity of hemoglobinolysis to classselective peptidase inhibitors. Accordingly, we functionally scanned gut extracts for individual peptidase activities
with a battery of diagnostic, small molecule substrates
and inhibitors. These studies revealed the presence of four
cysteine peptidase activities, cathepsins B, C, L and AE,
and an aspartic peptidase activity, cathepsin D.

The present functional and genetic profiling in the gut of
the hard tick I. ricinus has identified a number of peptidase activities and genes. The overall goal was to have a
better global understanding of the component peptidases
for one important tick species in a particular feeding
phase, namely partially engorged I. ricinus females, in contrast to the present fragmented picture regarding individual enzymes in a variety of different tick species. Also, this
broad approach offers both the possibility to compare
entire digestive systems with other hematophagous para-

To identify the peptidase genes putatively responsible for
the activities measured in gut extracts, we next screened
gut-derived cDNA with degenerate primers designed to
amplify individual peptidases. Five cysteine and one
aspartic peptidases were classified: IrAE [13], IrCB, IrCL,
IrCC and IrCD. Interestingly, from approximately 10
sequenced amplicons of each peptidase cDNA, only IrCB
presented as two different isoforms. The finding is comparable with the data for hematophagous flukes, Schistosoma
mansoni [26] and Trichobilharzia regenti [27], both of
which have more than one cathepsin B isoforms.

Sequence comparison with human cathepsin B reveals
that IrCB has the signature 'occluding loop' necessary for
its exopeptidase (specifically, peptidyl dipeptidase) activity [28]. Regarding murine cathepsin C, this enzyme was
previously shown to process and activate granulocyte serine peptidases by the removal of N-terminal dipeptides
[29]. Thus, it would be of interest to test the potential
competence of cathepsin C to processes cubulin-like serine peptidases inducing lysis of host blood cells [30]. The
primary structure of the IrCD precursor is homologous to
longepsin from H. longicornis [12] with two conserved
Asp-Thr-Gly (DTG) catalytic site motifs either side of the
substrate binding groove, a structure not shared by the
more evolutionary distinct yolk-processing tick cathepsin
D [31] and tick heme-binding aspartic peptidase [32] in

the eggs of B. microplus. Finally, a search through the available EST database (NCBI Blast with a limitation to tick
ESTs) indicated the existence of several isoforms for cathepsins B, L, AE and cathepsin D, but only one form of
cathepsin C in the whole body derived cDNA of the
closely related tick species, Ixodes scapularis [33]. Certainly,
these preliminary data need to await final contig assembly
and gene annotations and show the need for tick gut transcriptome projects.
With the exception of the eggs, host blood is taken up and
processed to provide energy and nutrients for the transition from larva to nymph and finally, to adult male or
female [4]. By RT-PCR, enzymes under study are expressed
in all the feeding developmental stages indicating their
simultaneous action in digestive cells. Notably, however,
IrCB and IrCD are not expressed in eggs, suggesting a function specifically associated with blood digestion. In support of this notion, the tissue-specific RT-PCR
demonstrated that both peptidases are expressed solely in
the gut. Likewise, IrAE is also restricted to the gut but,
being also found in eggs, must have an additional function(s) not associated with the blood meal.

Conclusion
The combined biochemical and genetic analyses presented in this study demonstrate that I. ricinus expresses a
suite of gut-associated cysteine and aspartic peptidases in
order to catabolize ingested host proteins as a nutrient
source. The data accord with previous results for enzyme
activities in different tick species [5,24]. The particular
combination of cysteine and aspartic peptidases comprising AE, and cathepsins B, C, D and L, operating at acidic
pH and localized to the gut, is remarkably similar to those
found in phylogenetically distant nematodes [17,34,35]
and platyhelminths [15,16,34]. Indeed, cysteine and
aspartic peptidases also contribute to amino acid acquisition in protozoa such as Plasmodium [36,37]. Therefore,
and as noted by Delcroix et al. [16] for the platyhelminth
S. mansoni, digestive systems based on cysteine and aspartic peptidases are widespread in invertebrates and stand in
contrast to those systems utilizing serine peptidases (e.g.,
in insects and vertebrates). The present report extends this
observation to include arthropods, specifically, ixodid
ticks.
On an applied note, gut-associated peptidases may prove
useful as vaccine targets. Other ixodid gut proteins, such
as Bm86/Bm95 or Bm91, are suitable antigens for vaccination strategies (reviewed in de la Fuente and Kocan
[38]). With this goal in mind, the detailed molecular and
cellular characterization of the I. ricinus peptidases will be
the subject of future reports.

Methods
Animals
I. ricinus ticks were collected by flagging in woodland
localities around Жeské BudЕjovice in the Czech Republic.
Adult males and females were kept separately in glass vials
in wet chambers with humidity of about 95% and temperature 26°C. If not stated otherwise, the females were
allowed to feed naturally for 5 days on laboratory guinea
pigs, carefully removed by forceps and referred to as partially engorged ticks in experiments described below. Laboratory animals were treated in accordance with the
Animal Protection Law of the Czech Republic no. 246/
1992 Sb.
Materials
The 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC)-conjugated
bovine hemoglobin was prepared according to Partanen
et al. [39]. All peptidyl AMC-substrates were from
Bachem, Abz-Lys-Pro-Ala-Glu-Phe-Nph-Ala-Leu (Abz,
aminobenzoic acid; Nph, 4-nitrophenylalanine) substrate
was prepared as described in Máša et al. [40]. Peptidase
inhibitors were from Bachem, Gly-Phe-diazomethyl
ketone (DMK) was prepared as described in Green and
Shaw [41]. The aza-peptide Michael acceptor (CBz-AlaAla-(aza-Asn)-CH = CH-COOEt) further referred to as
Aza-N-11a [42] was kindly donated by Dr. J.C. Powers of
the School of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia.
Preparation of the tick gut tissue extract
For an experiment, tissues were dissected from 10 partially
engorged I. ricinus females. The gut contents were carefully
removed with a special care not to disrupt the epithelium.
Cleaned guts were washed in phosphate-buffered saline
solution (PBS) and pooled. The gut tissue extract (150 µg
protein/ml) was prepared by homogenization of the gut
tissue (without contents) in 1 ml of 0.1 M Na-acetate, pH
4.5, 1% CHAPS, 2.5 mM DTT using teflon-glass homogenizer on ice. The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min
at 10000 × g, the supernatant was filtered with Micropure0.22 Separator (Millipore) and stored at -80°C.
Quantification of hemoglobin degradation
Hemoglobinolytic activity was assayed using AMC-hemoglobin as a fluorogenic substrate [43]. Digestion of fluorogenic AMC-hemoglobin (0.5 µg supplemented with 2 µg
of bovine hemoglobin) was performed at 35°C with the
gut tissue extract (20-fold diluted stock solution) in 0.1 M
Na-citrate-phosphate, pH 2.5–8.0 including 2.5 mM DTT,
25 mM NaCl and 0.05% Tween 20 in a reaction mixture
of 100 µl. The proteolytic fragmentation of AMC-hemoglobin results in an increase of the fluorescence intensity
that was continuously monitored to determine the relative reaction rate. The fluorescence signal was measured
using a GENios Plus reader (TECAN) at 360 nm excitation

Parasites & Vectors 2008, 1:7

and 465 nm emission wavelengths. For the hemoglobinolytic assay in the presence of a peptidase inhibitor, an aliquot of the extract was preincubated (15 min at 35°C) in
the same buffer pH 4.0 with 10 µM E64, 10 µM pepstatin,
1 mM Pefabloc or 1 mM EDTA.
Profiling component gut peptidases with substrates and
inhibitors
Peptidase activities were identified and characterized by
hydrolysis of the following fluorogenic substrates: 25 µM
Z-Arg-Arg-AMC for cathepsin B [44], 25 µM Z-Phe-ArgAMC for cathepsin L [44], 30 µM Gly-Arg-AMC for cathepsin C [45], 40 µM Abz-Lys-Pro-Ala-Glu-Phe-Nph-AlaLeu for cathepsin D [40], and 30 µM Z-Ala-Ala-Asn-AMC
for asparaginyl endopeptidase [46] as described previously [40,47]. The activity measurement was performed at
35°C using an aliquot of the gut tissue extract (20 to 200fold diluted stock solution) in 0.1 M Na-acetate, pH 4.0
including 2.5 mM DTT (for cysteine peptidases) and 25
mM NaCl (for cathepsin C). For the activity assay in the
presence of peptidase inhibitors, an aliquot of the extract
was pre-incubated (15 min at 35°C) in the same buffer
with the inhibitor: 10 µM CA-074 for cathepsin B [48], 10
µM Z-Phe-Phe-DMK for cathepsin L [49], 1 µM Gly-PheDMK for cathepsin C [41], 10 µM pepstatin for cathepsin
D [50] or 1 µM Aza-N-11a for asparaginyl endopeptidase
[42]. Hydrolytic activity was continuously measured after
addition of substrate in a fluorescence reader GENios Plus
at 320 nm excitation and 420 nm emission wavelengths
(for Abz-containing substrate) or at 360 nm excitation
and 465 nm emission wavelengths (for AMC-containing
substrates). Assays of asparaginyl endopeptidase and
cathepsin L were measured in the presence of 10 µM CA074 to prevent confounding hydrolysis by cathepsin B
[16,47].
cDNA synthesis
Tissues (gut, salivary glands, ovaries and Malpighian
tubules) were dissected from partially engorged females in
a wax filled Petri dish with phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) under a binocular dissection microscope. The
whole body homogenates from different developmental
stages were prepared by crushing the appropriate number
of eggs, larvae, nymphs, males, unfed females and females
removed from guinea pigs one day after attachment using
mortar and pestle and repeated freezing under liquid
nitrogen. For total RNA isolation, the samples were further homogenized in a micro-tube with a plastic pestle in
the TRI Reagent® solution (Sigma) at 1 ml per 50–100 mg
of wet tissue and processed according to the instructions
provided with the TRI-reagent kit (Sigma). Isolated total
RNA was stored at -80°C and further used for preparing
single stranded cDNA templates using Superscript II (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) primers, following the instructions

http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/1/1/7

provided by the manufacturer or for RT-PCR experiments
described below.
Designing PCR oligonuclotide primers
Degenerate primers were designed from conserved
domains of Schistosoma mansoni, S. japonicum, mosquito,
rat and human peptidases. Protein and nucleotide
sequences downloaded from the NCBI GenBank web site
were used for multiple ClustalW alignments in DNAstar
MegAlign software (Lasergene). The oligonucleotides are
listed in Table 1.
PCR and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5'- and 3-'
RACE)
Mastercycler gradient (Eppendorf) was used to optimize
PCR amplifications. Amplicons were purified, ligated into
vector plasmid pCR 4-TOPO using the TOPO TA® Cloning
Kit (Invitrogen) and transformed into E. coli TOP 10 cells
(Invitrogen). Clones containing ligated PCR products
were sequenced using an automated sequencer model ABI
Prism 3130 XL and the BigDye® Terminator sequencing kit
(Applied Biosystems) with appropriate sequencing primers. Sequence data were compared by blastn [51] against
the NCBI GenBank database records. To obtain complete
cDNA sequences, 3' RACE PCR was performed using a
modified protocol for SMART™ cDNA Library Construction Kit (Clontech, BD Biosciences) described previously
[52]. The N-terminal sequences including signal peptides
and the 5' untranslated regions were determined using the
Invitrogen 5'RACE system and instructions provided by
the manufacturer.
cDNA library construction and screening
The protocol for construction of the I. ricinus gut-derived
cDNA library with SMART™ cDNA Library Construction
Kit (Clontech, BD Biosciences) and the Gigapack® III Gold
packaging extract (Stratagene) as well as the method of
cDNA library screening by [P32]dATP radio-labeled genespecific probes have been described previously [13].
Phylogenetic analysis
The primary sequences used for phylogenetic analysis
comprised the conserved domains spanning across the
mature enzyme sequences without pro-domains.
Sequences were obtained from the MEROPS database [53]
and aligned in the program ClustalX 1.81 [54]. The alignment was manually checked using the BioEdit program
[55]. Tree reconstruction employed the Neighbor Joining
(NJ) method [56] in the program MEGA 2.1 [57]. Nodal
supports were calculated with 1000 replications.
Semi-quantitative RT-PCR
Gene specific PCR primer pairs (listed in Table 2) were
designed for each peptidase type with DNAstar PrimerSelect software (Lasergene). Two-step RT-PCR was per-

formed using total RNA templates (prepared as described
above; 50 ng/µl final concentration) and the Enhanced
Avian HS RT-PCR Kit (Sigma) according to the protocol
provided by the manufacturer. Amplification of the ferritin mRNA, previously shown to be presented in all tick tissues and expressed independently of feeding [58], was
used as a loading control.
