Abstract
Background: Random monoallelic expression contributes to phenotypic variation of cells and organisms. However,
the epigenetic mechanisms by which individual alleles are randomly selected for expression are not known. Taking
cues from chromatin signatures at imprinted gene loci such as the insulin-like growth factor 2 gene 2 (IGF2), we
evaluated the contribution of CTCF, a zinc finger protein required for parent-of-origin-specific expression of the
IGF2 gene, as well as a role for allele-specific association with DNA methylation, histone modification and RNA
polymerase II.
Results: Using array-based chromatin immunoprecipitation, we identified 293 genomic loci that are associated
with both CTCF and histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 9 (H3K9me3). A comparison of their genomic positions with
those of previously published monoallelically expressed genes revealed no significant overlap between allelespecifically expressed genes and colocalized CTCF/H3K9me3. To analyze the contributions of CTCF and H3K9me3
to gene regulation in more detail, we focused on the monoallelically expressed IGF2BP1 gene. In vitro binding
assays using the CTCF target motif at the IGF2BP1 gene, as well as allele-specific analysis of cytosine methylation
and CTCF binding, revealed that CTCF does not regulate mono- or biallelic IGF2BP1 expression. Surprisingly, we
found that RNA polymerase II is detected on both the maternal and paternal alleles in B lymphoblasts that express
IGF2BP1 primarily from one allele. Thus, allele-specific control of RNA polymerase II elongation regulates the allelic
bias of IGF2BP1 gene expression.
Conclusions: Colocalization of CTCF and H3K9me3 does not represent a reliable chromatin signature indicative of
monoallelic expression. Moreover, association of individual alleles with both active (H3K4me3) and silent
(H3K27me3) chromatin modifications (allelic bivalent chromatin) or with RNA polymerase II also fails to identify
monoallelically expressed gene loci. The selection of individual alleles for expression occurs in part during
transcription elongation.

Background
Allele-specific gene expression is an integral component
of cellular programming and development and contributes to the diversity of cellular phenotypes [1,2]. Allelic
differences in gene expression are mediated by either
parent-of-origin-specific selection (imprinting) or stochastic selection of alleles for activation and/or silencing. The importance of genomic imprinting has
recently been highlighted by RNA sequencing studies
that demonstrated widespread allelic differences in gene

expression in mouse brain affecting more than 1,300
genes [3]. The extent of sex- and stage-specific expression of individual alleles emphasizes the essential role of
allelic transcriptional regulation in development. In
addition to the extensive occurrence of imprinted parent-of-origin-specific expression, gene expression patterns of clonal cell populations are also modified by
random or stochastic silencing of either the maternal or
paternal allele. Well-known loci displaying allele-specific
expression include odorant receptor genes, immunoglobulins and various receptor proteins [4-6]. Additionally,
previous large-scale studies have provided new data
demonstrating that parent-of-origin-specific expression
is employed much more frequently than previously

thought [7]. These new findings illustrate the scale and
complexity of genomic allele-specific expression. However, the precise molecular mechanism underlying the
allelic bias in gene expression is not very well
understood.
The best-characterized locus with strict monoallelic
imprinted gene expression is the region containing the
insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) and H19 genes [8].
The regulation of this locus relies on the imprinting
control region (ICR), which acquires DNA methylation
on the paternal allele during normal development of the
male germline. Methylation of cytosines at the ICR inhibits binding of the zinc finger protein CTCF to the
paternal allele, preventing its role as an insulator and
allowing long-range interactions of the IGF2 promoter
with enhancer elements downstream of the H19 gene
[9-11]. In contrast, the unmethylated ICR on the maternal allele recruits CTCF, effectively preventing promoter-enhancer interactions and maintaining repression of
the maternal IGF2 gene.
The well-documented requirement of CTCF for
imprinted expression at the IGF2/H19 gene locus is
thought to result from its role in establishing and/or
maintaining long-distance interactions between regulatory elements [12]. Allele-specific binding of CTCF to
the ICR has long been known to be essential for the formation of chromatin loops. While the precise mechanism of CTCF’s role in long-distance chromatin
interactions remains unknown, several studies have provided a rationale for the differential expression of the
maternal and paternal IGF2 gene by revealing an interaction of CTCF with cohesin, a protein complex known
for its requirement during sister chromatid cohesion in
mitosis [13-16]. Chromosome conformation capture
experiments in combination with RNA interference
assays recently confirmed the CTCF and cohesin-dependent formation of higher-order chromatin structures at
the IGF2/H19 and other gene loci [17-19].
In addition to DNA methylation, histone modifications
also contribute to the maintenance of allele-specific
expression. DNA methylation of ICRs is accompanied
by repressive histone markers, including histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 9 (H3K9me3). In contrast, the
unmethylated allele is characterized by permissive histone markers, including histone H3 trimethylated at
lysine 4 [20]. Colocalization of epigenetic markers
including DNA methylation and histone H3 dimethylated at lysine 9 has been exploited to identify epigenetically distinct parental alleles. Chromosomal regions
displaying overlaps of euchromatin and heterochromatin-specific markers have been enriched for known
imprinted genes [21].
Despite the importance of monoallelic expression in
cellular development and differentiation, little is known

about the establishment and maintenance of random
monoallelic expression. The link between allele-specific
binding of CTCF and monoallelic expression of the
IGF2 gene prompted us to test whether the presence of
CTCF and H3K9me3 specifies a chromatin arrangement
which demarcates random monoallelically expressed
alleles. Using array-based chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-chip), we identified 293 loci displaying these
chromatin markers. We selected the IGF2BP1 gene
locus to further examine whether the presence of CTCF
and H3K9me3 comprises a necessary chromatin
arrangement for a specific expression profile analogous
to the monoallelic behavior observed at the IGF2/H19
locus. Surprisingly, colocalization of CTCF and
H3K9me3 does not provide a reliable measure of monoallelic binding of CTCF at the IGF2BP1 gene. Our studies
included
allele-specific
sequencing
of
immunoprecipitated chromatin to demonstrate that
chromatin at each IGF2BP1 allele is bivalent. Importantly, both alleles recruit RNA polymerase II, suggesting that silencing of one IGF2BP1 allele occurs after
transcription initiation. By establishing which epigenetic
configurations are involved in governing monoallelic
gene expression, we will broaden the understanding of
epigenetic mechanisms as they relate to cancer progression and cellular differentiation.

Results
Colocalization of CTCF and H3K9me3 in the human
genome

Allele-specific binding of CTCF to the ICR regulates
parent-of-origin-specific expression of the IGF2 gene
and correlates with differential cytosine methylation and
the presence of H3K9me3 [9-11]. We carried out a
large-scale survey to identify genomic sites with chromatin markers similar to those at the ICR of the IGF2/H19
locus. Using ChIP-chip, we identified CTCF binding
sites by tiling through the nonrepetitive portion of the
genome in 100-bp intervals. Genomic sites bound by
CTCF were assembled on a condensed array set that
tiled through 9,823 sites using overlapping probes, and
replicate ChIP experiments were performed. By using
conservative criteria (positive signal in three replicates; P
< 0.05) in this analysis, we identified 8,462 loci that
interact with CTCF. To identify the subset of sites that
associate with both CTCF and H3K9me3, we tested the
association of these 8,462 loci with H3K9me3 using the
condensed DNA array set. These analyses revealed 293
loci that are both bound by CTCF and marked by
H3K9me3 (Table S1 in Additional file 1) (distances of
CTCF and H3K9me3 peaks < 500 bp). Of the 293 loci,
115 directly mapped to coding regions. Of the remaining loci (174 of 293), the majority (147 loci) were
located in intergenic regions at a distance > 10 kb to

Thomas et al. Epigenetics & Chromatin 2011, 4:14
http://www.epigeneticsandchromatin.com/content/4/1/14

the nearest 5’ end of known genes. Only 27 loci mapped
to promoter regions. Overall, 40% of the CTCF/
H3K9me3 loci mapped to intergenic regions, 51%
mapped to intragenic domains and 9% mapped to promoter regions, a distribution similar to that of the 8,462
CTCF loci (44%, 51% and 10% respectively). Notably,
the CTCF-regulated IGF2/H19 locus is included in the
subset of 293 loci (Figure S1 in Additional file 2), suggesting that our experimental approach may be useful
for the identification of similarly expressed genes.
IGF2BP1 alleles are stochastically expressed in human B
cells

Genes classified as “monoallelically expressed” encompass both imprinted genes, such as the IGF2 gene,
where monoallelic expression is regulated in a parentof-origin-specific manner, and stochastic loci, where
individual alleles are randomly selected for expression
independent of parental origin. In recent studies in
which allele-specific transcription was assessed in several
human cell lines, more than 300 (7.5%) of 4,000 human
genes examined were subject to random monoallelic
expression, with a majority of the latter being capable of
biallelic expression [7].
To examine whether CTCF binding at sites marked by
H3K9me3 is indicative of monoallelic expression, we
first compared the genomic positions of our 293 loci
with the list of genes expressed in a random allele-specific manner. Only a small number of genes (8 of 293
loci) were common to both the monoallelically
expressed cohort described by Gimelbrant et al. [7] and
our CTCF/H3K9me3 set of ChIP-chip binding loci.
To further examine the correlation between CTCF/
H3K9me3 and monoallelic expression, we selected 12
genes located near one of the 293 CTCF/H3K9me3 sites
(DIAPH1, FUS1, PKP1, ARFGAP2, PCDHGA, MTHFR,
LAIR1, GPR3, ARMET, NPR1, NHLRC1 and IGF2BP1)
to search lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived from
a pedigree from the Center d’Etude du Polymorphisme
Humaine (CEPH) for SNPs in exonic and 3’-UTR
regions. The monoclonality of LCLs was confirmed by
analysis of their immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH)
gene rearrangement (Figure S2 in Additional file 2) [22].
Sequencing of genomic DNA (gDNA) and cDNA of
LCLs identified the insulin-like growth factor binding
protein gene IGF2BP1 as the only candidate gene
expressed from only one allele (Table S2 in Additional
file 1). IGF2BP1 is an RNA-binding protein that regulates transcript stability and translation of the imprinted
IGF2 gene [23]. In addition, IGF2BP1 binds to H19,
MYC and b-TrCP1 mRNA to regulate message half-life,
localization and translation of RNA, suggesting that the
regulation of IGF2BP1 expression may affect disease and
development [24,25]. We focused on IGF2BP1 to

examine the contribution of CTCF and H3K9me3 markers colocalized at intron 5 to allele-specific expression
(Figure 1).
Sequencing of gDNA identified 10 individuals that
were heterozygous at SNP rs11655950 in the 3’-UTR of
IGF2BP1 (Figure 2A). All heterozygous SNPs were subsequently typed in cDNA. A comparison of the transcriptome-derived genotypes to genomic genotypes
indicated that six individuals expressed IGF2BP1 primarily from only one allele. In contrast, four individuals
were found to express both IGF2BP1 alleles (Figure 2A).
SNP determination for genomic and cDNA for CEPH
family 1331 was confirmed by allelic discrimination
assays based on fluorogenic probes (TaqMan allelic discrimination assay; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,
USA), which yielded identical results (Figure S3 in Additional file 2). The TaqMan allelic discrimination assay, a
real-time PCR based approach, yields a scatterplot of
genotypes capable of quantitatively detecting a range of
1:1 and 1:5 ratios of individual alleles in DNA mixtures
at SNP rs11655950 (Figure S4 in Additional file 2). Individuals GM7033 and GM6989 were found to express
the paternally inherited IGF2BP1 allele, while GM7030
and GM7005 were found to express the maternally
inherited allele (Figure 2). Individuals GM7007 and
GM7016 also exhibited monoallelic expression of
IGF2BP1, but we were unable to identify the mode of
expression because of the limited pedigree. These data
indicate that monoallelic expression at the IGF2BP1
gene locus is not determined by parent-of-origin markings; instead, it is defined by stochastic choice.
CTCF binds to its target motif at the IGF2BP1 locus
independently of DNA methylation

Binding of CTCF to its target motifs at both the human
and mouse ICR of the IGF2/H19 locus is sensitive to
DNA methylation [10,26]. To test whether monoallelic
expression of IGF2BP1 in some individuals is also regulated by monoallelic DNA methylation of CTCF binding
motifs, we examined a role for CpG methylation and
allele-specific binding of CTCF at this locus.
To precisely determine the DNA sequence required
for CTCF binding at the IGF2BP1 locus, we searched
for potential motifs using SOMBRERO [27], a de novo
motif-finding algorithm that uses multiple self-organizing maps (SOM) to cluster sequences of a specific
length (reads) from a set of input sequences (such as
enriched genomic loci identified by ChIP-chip experiments). Motif alignment using STAMP [28] and comparison to the JASPAR transcription factor database [29]
identified a distinct cohort of 68 motif models, all of
which were identical to the canonical CTCF motif previously reported (Figure S5 in Additional file 2) [30].
The clustered reads associated with all 68 motif models

derived from CTCF ChIP experiments was analyzed by using microarrays with hybridization probes spaced 100 bp apart. The higher resolution of

were mapped back to sequences enriched in our ChIPchip analysis and were displayed using the UCSC Genome Browser (Figure S6 in Additional file 2). Using this
approach, we identified 28,713 peaks, each composed of
multiple overlapping reads, within the original 8,462
ChIP-chip loci. Using a strategy similar to that used to
study ChIP-seq clustering [31], our frequency analysis of
these peak heights yielded a bimodal distribution with
an evident power law at low peak heights deviating to a
clear excess in the numbers of peaks with heights > 10
(Figure S7 in Additional file 2). We consequently partitioned the peak populations into low-confidence and
high-confidence groups using the peak height threshold
of 10 (Figure S8 in Additional file 2).
Using this approach, we identified three potential
motifs (X, Y and Z) (Figure 3) within the 350-bp region
of the IGF2BP1 gene locus enriched in our ChIP-chip
experiments. Two of the putative binding sites, Y and Z,
accumulated a significant number of matches to motif
models. However, only one of the three putative CTCF
binding sites belongs to the group of high-confidence
binding sites (site Y) (Figure 3). In support of our in
silico analysis of CTCF binding, previously published
high-resolution ChIP-seq data on CTCF binding
revealed enrichment of sequences surrounding motifs Y

and Z (Figure 3A), suggesting that either one or both
motifs is required for CTCF recruitment.
To further define the contribution of motifs Y and Z
to CTCF binding, we measured their ability to recruit
CTCF in vitro using immobilized template assays (Figures 3B and 3C). Wild-type and mutant DNA templates
containing either one or both motifs were linked to
magnetic beads, incubated with nuclear extract, washed
and tested for association with CTCF by performing
Western blot analysis. A 105-bp template containing the
wild-type IGF2BP1 intronic sequence efficiently
recruited CTCF (Ywt 105-bp template) (Figure 3B). In
contrast, CTCF binding was severely reduced when the
putative CTCF motif Y was mutated by four base substitutions (Figure 3C and Figure S9 in Additional file 2).
To test the contribution of the adjacent motif Z to
CTCF binding at the IGF2BP1 locus, we generated several 125-bp DNA templates that encompassed both
CTCF target motifs (Figure 3B). Targeted mutations at
specific positions of motif Y and/or motif Z were introduced to test the contribution of each motif to recruitment of CTCF. Detailed sequences are shown in Figure
S9 in Additional file 2. As shown in Figure 3C, the 125bp template recruited CTCF more efficiently than the
105-bp template. However, motif Z does not contribute

that are homozygous for alleles A and G, respectively. Orange-labeled individuals contain both A and G alleles at SNP rs11655950 and represent
informative cell lines used for further analysis of monoallelic expression. Diamonds indicate cDNA samples, and black × indicates averaged

to CTCF recruitment, since targeted mutations in motif
Z do not influence the level of CTCF binding. Consistent with this notion, CTCF binding is undetectable in
the absence of a wild-type motif Y (Figure 3C).
CTCF binding site Y at the IGF2BP1 gene contains a
single CpG residue adjacent to the 14-bp core sequence of
CTCF (Figure 4A). To establish whether binding of CTCF
to Ywt is inhibited by cytosine methylation, we tested Ywt
105-bp immobilized templates after in vitro methylation of
cytosine residues by CpG methyltransferase M.Sssl. For

comparison, we examined CTCF motifs containing a
higher CpG content, including site A of the MYC gene
[32] as well as the B1 sequence of the ICR of the human
IGF2/H19 locus [10]. Cytosine methylation at the human
B1 sequence is known to inhibit binding of CTCF. Consistent with this, recruitment of CTCF in vitro to immobilized templates containing the B1 sequence or the MYC
site A is highly sensitive to DNA methylation (Figure 4B,
top). In contrast, CpG methylation of the Ywt motif has no
effect on CTCF recruitment. Replacement of the Ywt core

becomes sensitive to CpG methylation upon modification
of the core motif to the mouse R3 sequence, a homologue

of the human B1 sequence. In combination, despite the
presence of a methylable CpG residue, binding of CTCF
to the Ywt sequence of the IGF2BP1 gene in vitro is not
sensitive to CpG methylation.

To confirm that our in vitro characterization of CTCF
binding accurately reflected the in vivo association of
CTCF with the IGF2BP1 locus, we evaluated the methylation status of the CTCF motif and adjacent CpG residues in the IGF2BP1 intronic region in both biallelically
(GM7057) and monoallelically (GM6989) expressing
cells by using bisulfite sequencing (Figure 5). The
methylation levels were calculated using BiQ Analyzer
software [33]. Our data reveal that the CpG residue at
the 5’ end of the CTCF binding motif Y is invariably
methylated. In addition, other methylable residues in
this region exhibited some degree of DNA methylation.
To further confirm binding of CTCF to methylated
IGF2BP1 intronic sequences, we bisulfite-sequenced
DNA derived from immunoprecipitates of ChIP experiments with CTCF antibodies. As a control, we bisulfitesequenced the IGF2BP1 region derived from antiH3K9me3 ChIP experiments. The results confirmed our

CTCF with a methylated motif (Figures 5B and 5C).
CTCF and H3K9me3 colocalize at both the maternal and
paternal IGF2BP1 alleles

Consistent methylation of the CTCF-binding motif in
IGF2BP1 indicated that DNA methylation is not allelespecific. To directly determine whether CTCF is bound
monoallelically, we determined the allele-specific association of both CTCF and H3K9me3 by sequencing
DNA recovered from ChIP experiments. We first identified informative cell lines by genotyping individuals
from CEPH pedigree 1331 at SNP sites located close to
the CTCF binding site. Cell lines derived from both
monoallelically (GM7016 and GM6989) and biallelically
(GM7057) expressing individuals were heterozygous at
SNP site rs11870560 at the CTCF site (Figure 6A). We

Figure 6 Allelic specificity of CTCF and H3K9me3. Informative ChIP templates were analyzed using the TaqMan allelic discrimination assay to
address the allelic association of CTCF and H3K9me3. (A) Genotyping results at rs11870560 identify informative cell lines useful for the detection
of allele-specific association of CTCF and H3K9me3. gDNA obtained from monoallelic and biallelic cell lines were genotyped using the TaqMan
allelic discrimination assay. Squares represent gDNA samples and are coded in red and green to represent cell lines that are homozygous for
allele C and allele T, respectively. Orange indicates heterozygous individuals. Averaged triplicate of a no-template control (NTC) is shown near
the origin of the graph. (B) Genotyping at SNP rs11870560 with DNA templates recovered from ChIP experiments was used to identify the
enrichment of the two alleles with either CTCF (circle) or H3K9me3 (triangle). Each color shown in the figure key represents a lymphoblastoid
cell line (LCL) derived from an individual of the pedigree, while the shape represents the source of each sample (for example, squares signify
input samples, while circles and triangles indicate ChIP samples obtained with CTCF and H3K9me3 antibodies, respectively). Immunoprecipitated
templates were generated using the ChIP protocol described in Materials and Methods. Both monoallelic and biallelic cell lines indicate biallelic
distribution of both CTCF and H3K9me3. Diamonds indicate control LCL samples (standards) previously genotyped as homozygous CC,
heterozygous CT and homozygous TT.

dilutions of known homozygotes of the two possible
alleles to test its ability to quantitatively assess the contribution of each allele in a DNA mixture. This assay
provides quantitative results with high sensitivity and
reproducibility within a ten-fold range of DNA concentrations, thus making it a useful tool for allelic discrimination of immunoprecipitated DNA (Figure S4 in
Additional file 2). We used two monoallelically
(GM7016 and GM6989) and one biallelically (GM7057)
expressing cell lines to genotype DNA recovered from
ChIP assays using either anti-CTCF or anti-H3K9me3
antibodies. Each analysis was performed in triplicate.
Equal proportions of the two sequence variants were
detected in DNA derived from ChIP assays with either
H3K9me3 or CTCF antibodies, indicating that CTCF
associates with both the maternal and paternal alleles
(Figure 6B). Thus, monoallelic expression of the
IGF2BP1 gene is not mediated through monoallelic
binding of CTCF.
The IGF2BP1 promoter associates with both active and
silent histone modifications in B cells

To define alternative mechanisms responsible for random monoallelic expression of IGF2BP1, we sought to
identify markers that distinguish the active and inactive
alleles. K27-trimethylated and K4-trimethylated histone

H3, respectively, mark transcriptionally silent and active
chromatin. We determined the relative enrichment of
these two histone markers at the IGF2BP1 promoter for
each allele in both monoallelically and biallelically
expressing cell lines using ChIP with anti-H3K4me3 and
anti-H3K27me3 antibodies. Both H3K4me3 and
H3K27me3 were detected at the IGF2BP1 gene promoter (Figure 7A). To determine whether any of the histone modifications selectively associates with either
allele, we again searched for informative sequence SNPs
at the IGF2BP1 promoter region in the CEPH pedigree.
Cell lines derived from individuals GM6989 (monoallelically expressing cell line) and 7057 (biallelically expressing cell line) were heterozygous at SNP rs9890278
located upstream of the transcription initiation site,
whereas GM7007 (monoallelically expressing cell line)
was heterozygous for SNP rs4794017 located 1 kb
downstream of the transcription initiation site. To
address whether active and silent alleles in these cell
lines are distinguished by specific histone markers, we
sequenced SNPs rs9890278 and rs4794017 in gDNA
recovered from ChIP experiments using anti-H3K4me3
and anti-H3K27me3 antibodies. The results revealed
that both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 are detected on
both alleles in a bivalent fashion (Figure 7). In combination, our results indicate that both active and silent

Figure 7 IGF2BP1 promoter region is enriched with activating and silencing chromatin modifications. DNA recovered from ChIP
experiments using anti-H3K4me3, anti-H3K27me3 and RNA polymerase II ChIP templates was genotyped by sequencing the IGF2BP1 promoter
region containing sequence variant rs4794017 or rs9890278. Left: Enrichment of H3K4me3 (K4) and H3K27me3 (K27) in monoallelically (GM7007,

activating and silencing marks are significantly enriched. Right: Sequences enriched by ChIP were excised and sequenced. The results show an
association of both alleles with active and silent histone modifications at the IGF2BP1 promoter region independent of transcriptional status.

histone markers (H3K4me3 and H3K27me3) coexist in
the promoter region of both IGF2BP1 alleles in monoallelically as well as biallelically expressing cell lines.
These data indicate that allele-specific expression of
IGF2BP1 cannot be explained by differential association
of active and silent histone markers.
Silencing of the inactive IGF2BP1 allele by inhibition of
RNA polymerase II elongation

Monoallelic expression of IGF2BP1 cannot be attributed
solely to selective activation or silencing of one allele
through histone modifications, since H3K4me3 as well
as H3K27me3 are detected at both alleles. H3K4me3 is
typically associated with transcriptionally active alleles,
raising the question whether allele-specific transcription
elongation or RNA processing accounts for monoallelic
expression of the IGF2BP1 gene. To address this
hypothesis, we again searched mono- and biallelically
expressing cell lines for sequence SNPs near the site of
transcription initiation at the IGF2BP1 promoter.
Within CEPH pedigree 1331, only line GM7007 contained a heterozygous genotype at SNP site rs4794017
located within intron 1, 1 kb downstream of the transcription initiation site. We performed RNA polymerase
II ChIP on chromatin prepared from this monoallelically
expressing line. Quantitative real-time PCR analyses
revealed enrichment of IGF2BP1 promoter sequences

similar to the enrichment observed at the MYC promoter. Immunoprecipitated DNA was PCR-amplified and
sequenced (Figure 8A). Identification of both sequence
variants at rs4794017 in DNA recovered from ChIP
experiments indicates that RNA polymerase II is associated with both IGF2BP1 alleles, which is consistent
with the presence of H3K4me3 at the promoter of both
alleles.
These data suggest that allele specificity of transcription is achieved after recruitment of RNA polymerase to
both alleles, such as through transcriptional pausing
and/or selective RNA processing. A major rate-limiting
step in transcription elongation is pausing of RNA polymerase II in the promoter proximal region immediately
downstream of the transcription initiation site [34-37].
We sequenced the 5’ portion of the IGF2BP1 gene of all
monoallelically expressing cell lines to identify sequence
variants that would be useful for allelic identification of
promoter proximal regions occupied by RNA polymerase II or for the determination of the allelic origin of
unspliced, precursor pre-mRNA transcripts. Since no
additional informative sequence variants were identified,
we focused on the detection and sequencing of premRNA transcripts about 1 kb downstream of the transcription initiation site in GM7007. Using the informative SNPs located within intron 1 of this gene, we
targeted nascent unspliced RNA with primers designed

Figure 8 RNA polymerase II associates with both alleles in a monoallelically expressing cell line. (A) Recruitment of RNA polymerase II to
the IGF2BP1 promoter was examined by ChIP in monoallelically expressing GM7007 cells. DNA recovered from chromatin that had been
immunoprecipitated with anti-RNA polymerase II antibodies (Pol2) was amplified and sequenced for allelic association. Sequencing results
(bottom) reveal that both alleles of the monoallelically expressing cell line GM7007 associate with RNA polymerase II near SNP site rs4794017. In
contrast, sequencing of DNA from “no antibody” ChIP reactions failed to produce sequence reads. (B) Allele specificity of precursor mRNA was
determined by sequencing of cDNA prepared from total RNA of GM7007 cells. RNA had been extensively pretreated with DNase I to eliminate
gDNA prior to reverse transcription by RT. Subsequently, cDNA samples were amplified using primers flanking rs4794017. In the absence of RT
(-RT), no amplification products were oberved. +RT amplicons were gel-purified and sequenced. Bottom: Sequence traces at the heterozygous

avoid detection of gDNA in RNA samples, DNA was
efficiently removed by treatment with an engineered,
highly active form of DNase I (TURBO DNase I;
Applied Biosystems/Ambion, Austin, TX, USA). This
protocol allowed detection of pre-mRNA free of gDNA
contamination (Figure 8B). Sequencing of amplified

IGF2BP1 pre-cDNA revealed only one of the two
sequence variants at SNP rs4794017, indicating that premRNA transcripts are transcribed from only one allele
despite the presence of RNA polymerase II on both
alleles. Thus, our data indicate that monoallelic expression of the IGF2BP1 gene is regulated through allelespecific transcriptional elongation prior to SNP site

rs4794017, located approximately 600 bp downstream of
the first intron splice site.

Discussion
Allele-specific expression in which one parental allele is
stochastically or parent-of-origin-specifically silenced is
widespread in mammalian organisms. Large-scale, allelespecific gene expression analyses have revealed that 5%
to 10% of autosomal genes show random monoallelic
transcription [7]. The stability of allele-specific expression through many cell passages suggests that epigenetic
modifications maintain this specific type of gene regulation throughout generations of cells. Analogously to the
regulation at the imprinted IGF2/H19 locus, we tested
the hypothesis whether monoallelic binding of CTCF, a
characteristic marker for the IGF2/H19 ICR, also underlies random monoallelic expression. Using ChIP-chip
analyses, we identified chromosomal loci that are
enriched in both CTCF and H3K9me3 and cross-correlated their positions with previously published lists of
monoallelically expressed genes. Our data indicate that
genomic loci enriched for both CTCF and H3K9me3 do
not significantly correlate with monoallelically expressed
genes. While this lack of correlation could be formally
attributed to variations in monoallelic expression
between different cell lines and types, it should be noted
that the genome-wide pattern of CTCF binding is very
consistent between different cell lineages [30,38,39].
Thus, if CTCF and H3K9me3 contribute to allele-specific expression, it should be detectable through allele-specific association of CTCF and H3K9me3. Focusing on
the IGF2BP1 gene, we tested whether monoallelic
expression in a pedigree of LCLs correlates with monoallelic binding of CTCF. Although binding of CTCF to
its targets is thought to be sensitive to DNA methylation, we surprisingly found the cytosine residue closely
flanking the CTCF target motif at the IGF2BP1 gene to
be consistently methylated without any effect on CTCF
recruitment. Indeed, our in vitro analyses of the binding
requirements using immobilized templates confirmed
that methylation of cytosine residues within the
IGF2BP1 sequence does not affect CTCF binding. These
data are consistent with those in previous studies in
which researchers found that cytosine methylation outside the CTCF core motif did not affect the binding affinity of bacterially expressed wild-type and mutant CTCF
proteins [40]. This information is useful for the identification of the genomic subset of CTCF sites that might
contribute to differential cell- and stage-specific expression due to their sensitivity to cytosine methylation,
potentially mediating changes in large-scale chromatin
organization during development and disease.
A number of studies have examined the correlation of
allele-specific expression with allele-specific association

Page 12 of 16

of epigenetic markers [21,41-45]. The data produced by
these studies have established common signatures of
imprinted alleles, including H3K9me3 and H3K4me3,
providing a powerful means by which to identify novel
imprinted or monoallelically expressed loci [46-48]. In
contrast to the strict allele-specific association of DNA
methylation and chromatin markers at imprinted genes,
histone modifications at the nonimprinted, monoallelically expressed IGF2BP1 gene do not predict the active
allele. Both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, markers characteristic of active and inactive loci, are associated with
each allele, as both sequence variants of SNP rs4794017
are present in the DNA of heterozygous individuals
recovered from ChIP experiments. Moreover, loading of
RNA polymerase II also does not provide a reliable marker for identifying the transcribed allele. Our ChIP
experiments identified both sequence variants at SNP
rs4794017 within the promoter proximal region of antiRNA polymerase II immunoprecipitated DNA. Because
only one LCL in our study was informative for determining an association of RNA polymerase II at the IGF2BP1
alleles, we could not define how frequently this type of
regulation occurs within cell lineages and throughout the
genome. However, other investigators have reported
similar results at the PCNA gene. Maynard et al. [44]
found that both PCNA alleles in IMR90 cells are bound
by RNA polymerase II, although only one allele generates
full-length mRNA. Together, these data suggest that
transcription elongation not only is a general rate-limiting step in the transcription of the vast majority of genes
[34,35,37] but also regulates the expression of a subset of
monoallelically expressed genes.
The expression of IGF2BP1 in differentiated cell types,
including LCLs, is significantly lower than in embryonic
stem cells. In an attempt to determine whether allelespecific expression also contributes to IGF2BP1 regulation early in development, we genotyped both gDNA
and cDNA in 11 human embryonic stem cell (hESC)
lines. However, while only three hESC lines were informative (heterozygous at SNP rs11655950), all three
expressed IGF2BP1 in a biallelic manner. Although the
number of available and informative hESC lines is not
sufficient to clearly define a role for allele-specific elongation in early developmental stages, we believe that it
is unlikely that this mechanism is restricted to cell types
with low levels of IGF2BP1 expression. Control of transcriptional activity through promoter proximal pausing
or premature termination of transcription is not
restricted to specific gene classes characterized by low
levels of transcriptional activity [35]. We speculate that
distinct positioning of the homologous alleles within the
nuclear space and association with distinct “transcription factories” may contribute to monoallelic transcription elongation.

Thomas et al. Epigenetics & Chromatin 2011, 4:14
http://www.epigeneticsandchromatin.com/content/4/1/14

The IGF2BP1 gene is highly expressed during embryonic development and is required for the regulation of
mRNA stability of several genes involved in growth regulation, including the IGF2, b-catenin and MYC genes
[23-25]. Consistent with its role in early developmental
stages, the IGF2BP1 gene is downregulated in differentiated cell types, and overexpression of IGF2BP1 is
known to occur in multiple human cancers, including
breast, lung and colon [49-52]. Thus, changes in the
level of IGF2BP1 expression through silencing of only
one allele could provide a safeguard against pathogenesis
and disease.

Conclusions
Allele-specific gene expression is common in the human
genome and is thought to contribute to phenotypic variation. The allele-specific association of CTCF, H3K9me3
and DNA methylation is a characteristic marker of
imprinted gene expression at the IGF2/H19 locus, raising
the question whether these epigenetic markers are useful
for identifying both imprinted and random monoallelically
expressed genes throughout the genome. In this study, we
have demonstrated that colocalization of CTCF and
H3K9me3 does not represent a reliable chromatin signature indicative of monoallelic expression. In addition, we
conclude that allele-specific binding of CTCF requires
methylation of very specific cytosine residues within the
target motif, effectively limiting the number of CTCF binding sites potentially affected by allele-specific binding. In
addition, the active and inactive alleles of random monoallelically expressed genes do not necessarily correlate with
active or inactive histone markers. Remarkably, the selection of individual alleles for expression at the IGF2BP1
locus occurs during early stages of transcription elongation.

sequence probe and the flanking probes within a window covering 250 bp on both sides of the probe had
log2 ratio values above a specified cutoff value. The cutoff value was calculated separately for each chromosome. The cutoff value is a given percentage of the
value (mean + 6 × standard deviation) of the log2 ratio
values of all the probes covering the chromosome. The
possible binding sites thus detected are called peaks. To
calculate the false-positive rate (FPR) by data permutation, the log2 ratio values among probes were scrambled
to generate a randomized data set for each individual
chromosome. Multiple repetitions of this process generated 20 randomized data sets for each chromosome.
Subsequently, the peak detection algorithm described
above was applied to count the average number of
peaks in the 20 randomized data sets using the same
cutoff. The ratio of that number to the number of peaks
from the nonrandomized data set is the FPR. The FPR
is associated with the threshold setting, which is indicated by the value of cutoff P. Peak detection and randomization of data sets were repeated for different
threshold settings of P. The corresponding FPRs were
calculated and assigned to peaks. The FPR value
assigned to the individual peaks is the value associated
with the cutoff P at which the peak is first detected.
Peak discovery was performed using chromatin immunoprecipitate:input ratios combined from adjacent oligonucleotides within 250-bp regions. The FPR of detection
was estimated by permutation analyses in which the
experimentally determined log2 ratio values were reassigned to probes in a random fashion, allowing selection
of stringency and specificity levels. To define sites of
CTCF interaction with high confidence, peaks were
required to be present in all three biological replicates
and to be generated at a FPR < 0.05.

Methods
ChIP-chip analyses

Chromatin immunoprecipitation

The amplification and preparation of immunoprecipitated DNA derived from HBL100 cells for hybridization
to ENCODE arrays (Roche NimbleGen Inc., Madison,
WI, USA) was performed essentially as described previously [53]. Sample labeling and array hybridization
were performed at NimbleGen Systems Inc. Genomic
control DNA was labeled with Cy3, and sample DNA
was labeled with Cy5. Both Cy3- and Cy5-labeled DNA
were hybridized to high-density arrays tiling through
ENCODE regions with 50-mer oligonucleotides across
nonrepetitive genomic regions. The ratios of the Cy3
and Cy5 intensities of each probe were calculated using
NimbleGen Systems’ proprietary software.

Chromatin was prepared for immunoprecipitation as
described previously [54] by cross-linking the cells in 1%
formaldehyde for 5 minutes and subjecting them to subsequent sonication until the bulk of DNA was 300 to
600 bp in size. Chromatin corresponding to 2 × 10 7
cells was immunoprecipitated with anti-CTCF antibody
(D31H2; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA,
USA), anti-H3K9me3 antibody (ab8898; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), anti-trimethyl K4-histone H3 antibody (ab8580; Abcam), anti-trimethyl K27-histone H3
antibody (Millipore 07-449, Billerica MA, USA) or antiRNA polymerase II antibody (sc899; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Immunoprecipitates
were washed, the DNA protein cross-links were reversed
and the recovered DNA was tested by performing conventional quantitative PCR as described previously [54].
RNA polymerase II ChIP experiments were performed

using the Matrix ChIP protocol [55]. Sequences of primers specific for the gene loci under study as well as
the reference primers are available upon request.
RNA extraction and RT-PCR

Synthesis of cDNA was carried out according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen, Valencia, CA,
USA) using 1 μg of total RNA. For detection of premRNA, RNA preparations were pretreated with TURBO
DNase I (Ambion/Applied Biosystems) as described in
the manufacturer’s protocol. RT was carried out at 37°C
for one hour.
Cell culture

Cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mM L-glutamine and the antibiotics penicillin (50 U/mL) and streptomycin.
Sodium bisulfite conversions

gDNA was treated with sodium bisulfite using the EZ
DNA Methylation Kit (Zymo Research, Orange, CA,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. PCR
amplification of bisulfite-treated DNA was performed
using ZymoTaq DNA Polymerase (Zymo Research Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA) and conversion-specific primers targeted to the IGF2BP1 CTCF region (forward
primer: 5’-TATTTTTTAGTTGGGTTAAT-TGGTG-3’,
reverse primer: 5’-ATACTACCTCTCCTTCCAAA
ATCTC-3’). The amplified products were purified by gel
electrophoresis and sequenced. Each case was scored as
methylated or unmethylated, and the percentage of
methylation was calculated using BiQ Analyzer software
[33].
TaqMan allelic discrimination assays

TaqMan allelic discrimination assays were performed
according to the manufacturer’s instructions with the
following adjustments: cDNA from B lymphoblasts was
preamplified for 14 cycles. PCR products were gel-purified and subsequently used as templates in the genotyping of samples. The specific primer sequences used are
avaliable upon request.
In vitro CTCF binding analysis using immobilized
templates

Crude nuclear extract was prepared from 1 × 109 Jurkat
cells grown in growth media (RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal
bovine serum) according to methods described previously [56]. Biotinylated template DNA was generated
by PCR amplification of the IGF2BP1 intronic region
using a biotinylated/nonbiotinylated primer combination. The specific primer sequences are available upon
request. For each binding reaction, 1 pM biotinylated
DNA template was coupled to 50-μg streptavidin-linked

Page 14 of 16

magnetic beads (Dynabeads M-280 Streptavidin; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Templates immobilized to
magnetic beads were washed three times in B&W buffer
(5 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA), 1 M NaCl) and resuspended in Jurkat
nuclear extract. After a two-hour incubation at 4°C,
immobilized templates were washed three times in
Dignam buffer D (20 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.1 M KCl,
1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid,
1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM dithiothreitol) containing protease inhibitor (P8340; Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA). To
recover template-bound proteins, beads were incubated
in elution buffer (5 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1
M NaHCO3 ) including protease inhibitors. After a 5minute incubation, the eluate was removed and transferred into a fresh tube. The presence of CTCF in the
eluate was determined using standard Western blot analysis protocols.

sequences is indicated by red bar. Several read clusters are apparent and
vary in depth and spatial extent (green areas). Figure S7. Frequency
distribution of cluster depth for all motif clusters. A power law is
apparent for clusters of depth ≤ 10 with evident deviation in the
population and a maximum of about 40. The vertical green line
demarcates the low and high confidence clusters. Figure S8.
Discrimination between high- and low-confidence sites. The region
shown in Supplemental Figure S6 is annotated by overlaying enriched
sequences with high- and low-confidence tracks. Figure S9. Sequences
of immobilized templates used in in vitro binding experiments.
CTCF core motifs Y and Z are underlined. Site-specific mutations in either
the Y or Z motif are highlighted in yellow. In Ymut chFII and Ymut mmR3,
site-specific mutations (highlighted in green) were introduced to
generate CTCF motifs identical to the chicken HS4 FII site and the mouse
imprinting control region R3. The IGF2 wild-type huB1 sequence is
derived from the human IGF2 imprinting control region containing the
methylation-sensitive CTCF binding site B1.
