Abstract
Background: The Fox gene family comprises a large and functionally diverse group of forkhead-related
transcriptional regulators, many of which are essential for metazoan embryogenesis and physiology.
Defining conserved functional domains that mediate the transcriptional activity of Fox proteins will
contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the biological function of Fox family genes.
Results: Systematic analysis of 458 protein sequences of the metazoan Fox family was performed to
identify the presence of the engrailed homology-1 motif (eh1), a motif known to mediate physical
interaction with transcriptional corepressors of the TLE/Groucho family. Greater than 50% of Fox
proteins contain sequences with high similarity to the eh1 motif, including ten of the nineteen Fox
subclasses (A, B, C, D, E, G, H, I, L, and Q) and Fox proteins of early divergent species such as marine
sponge. The eh1 motif is not detected in Fox proteins of the F, J, K, M, N, O, P, R and S subclasses, or in
yeast Fox proteins. The eh1-like motifs are positioned C-terminal to the winged helix DNA-binding
domain in all subclasses except for FoxG proteins, which have an N-terminal motif. Two similar eh1-like
motifs are found in the zebrafish FoxQ1 and in FoxG proteins of sea urchin and amphioxus. The
identification of eh1-like motifs by manual sequence alignment was validated by statistical analyses of the
Swiss protein database, confirming a high frequency of occurrence of eh1-like sequences in Fox family
proteins. Structural predictions suggest that the majority of identified eh1-like motifs are short α-helices,
and wheel modeling revealed an amphipathicity that supports this secondary structure prediction.
Conclusion: A search for eh1 Groucho interaction motifs in the Fox gene family has identified eh1-like
sequences in greater than 50% of Fox proteins. The results predict a physical and functional interaction of
TLE/Groucho corepressors with many members of the Fox family of transcriptional regulators. Given the
functional importance of the eh1 motif in transcriptional regulation, our annotation of this motif in the Fox
gene family will facilitate further study of the diverse transcriptional and regulatory roles of Fox family
proteins.

Background
DNA-binding transcriptional regulatory proteins have a
modular structure and are composed of a sequence-specific DNA-binding domain and trans-regulatory domains.
Multiple studies have shown that short conserved peptide
regions mediate the biological functions of trans-regulatory domains. In the case of transcriptional repressors,
such short protein regions can autonomously mediate
repression when fused to a heterologous DNA-binding
domain [1,2]. It appears that these conserved regions
form either α-helices or binding pockets to provide specific interacting surfaces for transcriptional corepressors.
For instance, the Sin3 interaction motif of NRSF/REST
adopts a short amphipathic α-helix that mediates specific
physical interactions with the Sin3 transcriptional corepressor [3]. In the present study, we focus on identifying
and analyzing the Engrailed homology region-1 (eh1)
transcriptional repression motif in the Fox gene family of
forkhead-related transcriptional regulators. This motif is
known to mediate specific physical interactions of a
number of protein families with transcriptional corepressors of the TLE/Groucho protein family [4-7].
The eh1 motif is composed of eight amino acid residues
with the sequence pattern FS(I/V)XXΦΦX, with X representing any non-polar or charged residue and Φ representing branched hydrophobic residues. The eh1 motif was
originally identified as a conserved N-terminal sequence
shared between the Drosophila Engrailed protein and its
vertebrate orthologs [6]. Functional analysis of the
Engrailed protein has shown that the eh1 motif is
required for active transcriptional repression in vivo, as
well as for the physical interaction with Groucho corepressors [7,8]. An eh1-like motif was also identified in
eight classes of the homeodomain protein superfamily
(Emx, Dlx, Gsc, Hex, Msh, Six, Oct and Vnd) [5,9,10]. Further in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that the eh1like motif of Gsc, Nkx, Hex and Six is required for repression function in vivo by recruiting the TLE/Groucho corepressors [5,9,11].
Eh1-like motifs have also been found in several members
of the Fox family of forkhead-related transcriptional regulators [12]. Fox proteins are essential transcriptional regulators of embryogenesis, homeostasis, metabolism, and
aging in metazoan organisms [13]. The highly conserved
DNA-binding domain of Fox family proteins is characterized by the formation of three α-helixes, three β-strands
and two loops resembling wings [14], thus the winged
helix DNA-binding domain (WHD) designation. The
WHD is flanked by N- and C-terminal regions that share
low similarity among the Fox protein subclasses. The initial classification of Fox proteins based on sequence-relatedness within the WHD established fifteen subclasses of
the Fox gene family [15], and four additional Fox sub-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/201

classes were subsequently identified [16,17]. An updated
list of Fox gene family members is available online [18].
Sequence analysis of several Fox proteins revealed that a
short conserved C-terminal region of FoxA proteins (conserved region II or CII) was similar to the eh1 motif [12].
Further biochemical studies showed that FoxA2 physically
interacts with TLE1, a mammalian Groucho protein, via
the CII region [19]. These data suggest that the CII region
not only resembles the eh1 motif in sequence, but also in
the ability to directly binding Groucho/TLE corepressors.
In addition, the Drosophila FoxG ortholog, Slp1, physically interacts with Groucho via an N-terminal eh1-like
motif [20]. Furthermore, our recent studies in Xenopus
have shown that FoxD3 can associate with the Xenopus
Groucho ortholog, Grg4, via an eh1-like motif. The FoxD3
eh1 motif is essential for a functional interaction with
Grg4 and for transcriptional repression in vivo [21]. These
observations suggest an interaction of Groucho corepressors with multiple Fox family proteins, and prompted us
to systematically examine all subclasses of the Fox gene
family for the presence of eh1-like motifs. Given the functional importance of the eh1 motif in transcriptional regulation, annotation of the presence, pattern of
distribution, and structural characteristics of this motif in
the Fox gene family will facilitate further study of the
diverse transcriptional and regulatory roles of Fox family
proteins.
Here, we present a complete systematic analysis of the
presence of eh1-like motifs in metazoan Fox proteins.
Eh1-like motifs are identified in more than 50% of Fox
proteins representing ten Fox family subclasses (A, B, C,
D, G, E, H, I, L and Q) and statistical analyses of the Swiss
protein database confirm a frequent occurrence of the
motif in the Fox family. Secondary structure analysis of
these Fox proteins predicts that the eh1-like motifs adopt
a short amphipathic α-helical structure. Taken together,
the results point to a functional interaction of TLE/Groucho corepressors with many members of the Fox family
and identify structural features of the eh1 motifs that will
facilitate further study of the physical interaction of Fox
proteins with TLE/Groucho corepressors.

Results
Identification of eh1-like motifs in ten subclasses of the Fox
gene family
We performed a systematic analysis of 458 yeast and
metazoan protein sequences belonging to nineteen subclasses of the Fox family of transcriptional factors for the
presence of eh1-like motifs. An initial manual search was
conducted for the presence of sequences composed of
eight amino acids with a highly conserved hydrophobic
core matching the eh1 motif pattern of FSΦXXΦΦX (X,
non-polar or charged residue; Φ, branched hydrophobic

residue). Conserved regions of aligned orthologous Fox
protein sequences were examined for homology to the
eh1 consensus sequence. Eh1-like motifs were identified
in Fox protein sequences of 10 subclasses, including the A,
B, C, D, E, G, H, I, L and Q, but not in Fox proteins of the
F, J, K, M, N, O, P, R and S subclasses (Table 1). Fox proteins containing an eh1-like motif were found across multiple animal phyla, and included chordates,
hemichordates, and a variety of invertebrates, but not
yeast (Tables 2 and 3). The identified motifs exhibit high
similarity to the Drosophila eh1 motif in the range of 50–
87%. To summarize the results, a phylogenetic tree for the
Fox gene family was constructed in which the presence of
an eh1-like motif within individual Fox proteins is indicated [see Additional files 1 and 2].
To validate the results of the manual search for eh1-like
motifs, we used the expectation-maximization algorithm
in the MEME program [22]. We initially examined 18
FoxD3-related protein sequences, which contain a conserved and functional eh1 motif [21]. As predicted, the
analysis identified eh1-like motifs (E-value of 10-75) at 18
sites corresponding to the previously described eh1 motif
of FoxD3. When this approach was extended to the entire
Fox family of 458 proteins, eh1-like motifs were identified
at 213 sites in ten Fox subclasses (E-value of <10-16). The
eh1-like motifs identified using the expectation-maximization algorithm corresponded to motifs identified in the
manual sequence analysis, as well as to motifs previously
identified in the Fox family [12,23].

To confirm the statistical significance of the match
between identified eh1-like sequences and the eh1 consensus, a hidden Markov model (HMM) was constructed
[24] for the eh1 motif of FoxD3 (eh1 FD3). This model of
the eh1 motif was used to search the SWISS protein database and a summary of the results of the eh1 FD3 HHM
analysis is shown in Table 4. A total of 49,363 matches
with the eh1 motif were identified, and 647 matches were
to proteins that are members of transcription factor families. The mean log-odds score for all transcriptional proteins was 9.07, whereas non-transcriptional proteins
scored at 6.87. Among transcriptional proteins, Fox family
proteins resulted in the strongest matches with the eh1
motif, with a mean log-odds scores of 14.34. The motifs
were identified in 9 subclasses of the Fox protein family
which included A, B, C, D, E, G, H, L and Q (the FoxI subclass is not represented in the current SWISS protein database). The search also identified a significant number of
high scoring matches (mean log-odds score of 11.61) for
homeodomain-containing proteins of the para-Hox cluster [25], but the score for other non-Fox, non-para-Hox
transcriptional proteins was low (7.72). The results of the
HMM analysis strongly supports the conclusion that eh1like motifs are present within proteins of the Fox family at
high frequency when compared with most transcriptional
protein families and non-transcriptional proteins.
To evaluate the statistical significance of the eh1-like
motif identification results obtained by HMM, logistic
regression analysis was performed. Analysis of the logodds scores for the transcriptional protein and non-tran-

b Protein

scriptional protein classes indicated that the association of
eh1-like motifs with transcriptional proteins had high statistical significance (p < 2 × 10-9). Furthermore, analysis of
the log-odds scores for the Fox family transcriptional proteins and other transcriptional protein classes were analyzed, the association of higher log-odds scores with Fox
proteins was found to have high statistical significance (p
< 2 × 10-9). The results strongly support the conclusion
that eh1 motifs are present in members of the Fox family
at high frequency, and suggest that the eh1 motif contributes to the transcriptional function of many Fox family
proteins.
For most of the Fox proteins analyzed, a single eh1-like
motif was located C-terminal to the WHD (Fox subclasses
A, B, C, D, E, H, I, L and Q). Two similar eh1-like motifs
are present in the zebrafish FoxQ1 protein, with both Cterminal to the WHD. Interestingly, the C. elegans FoxD
and sea urchin, amphioxus and zebrafish FoxQ2 proteins
contain N-terminal eh1-like motifs, whereas a C-terminal
motif location is found for the other FoxD and FoxQ
orthologs. All FoxG proteins contain an eh1-like motif Nterminal to the WHD, and in sea urchin and amphioxus
FoxG proteins a second eh1-like motif is located C-terminal to the WHD. The vertebrate FoxG proteins contain a
C-terminal sequence that appears to be a remnant of an
eh1 motif that lacks the conserved phenylalanine. Eh1like motifs were identified in Fox proteins in several early
divergent species. These included sponge (phylum Porifera) FoxD, hydra and sea anemone (phylum Cnidaria)
FoxA, and comb jelly (phylum Ctenophora) FoxG. The
presence of eh1 motifs in Fox proteins of these phyla suggests an ancient appearance of this motif in the Fox gene
family and therefore, a functional interaction with Groucho-related corepressors early in the evolution of the Fox
gene family.

Loss of eh1-like motifs within Fox gene subclasses
Our sequence analysis indicates incomplete distribution
of the motif within certain Fox subclasses, suggesting the
loss of the motif in a subset of Fox proteins. A striking
example of the loss of the eh1-like motif is observed
within the FoxE subclass for FoxE1 proteins. Sequence
analysis of FoxE subclass proteins did not identify a recognizable eh1 motif in seven mammalian FoxE1 proteins,
whereas FoxE1 proteins of fish and amphibia, and nine
other FoxE proteins contained the motif. To assess the
inheritance and loss of the eh1 motif during the evolution
of FoxE proteins, a phylogenetic tree for the FoxE subclass
and the FoxC and FoxD outgroups was constructed using
a neighbor-joining method (Figure 1). The topology of
the phylogenetic tree (bootstrap value 91%) indicates a
close relatedness of the fish, amphibian, and mammalian
FoxE1 proteins, which suggests a common ancestry.
Therefore it is reasonable to infer that the ancestral FoxE1
protein contained the motif, and the loss of the eh1 motif
occurred in the mammalian lineage or ancestors of the
mammalian phyla in the course of evolution. All other
members of the FoxE subclass, including the amphioxus
and tunicate proteins, as well as mammalian FoxE3 proteins, contained the motif. This suggests that most likely
an ancestral FoxE protein contained the motif before the
separation and expansion of the FoxE subclass, and this
idea is supported by the presence of the motif in nearly all
members of the FoxC and FoxD outgroups.

It should be noted that a cnidarian FoxE-related protein
lacks the eh1 motif, and this may be viewed as inconsistent with the presence of the eh1 motif in the ancestral
FoxE protein. However, phylogenetic analysis indicates a
distant relatedness of this cnidarian protein to the FoxE
subclass, arguing for different origins. Similarly, the motif
is not detected in the N. vectensis FoxD- and FoxC-related
proteins, which also appear to have undergone significant
sequence divergence. The motif is present in cnidarian

tain the motif. The absence of the eh1 motif in the tunicate FoxH proteins suggests a divergence and loss of this
motif in the hemichordate lineage. However, it is also
possible that the ancestral FoxH protein did not contain
an eh1 motif and that the motif was recruited in the vertebrate lineage. Interestingly, a Xenopus FoxH1 paralog,
FoxH3, also lacks the eh1 motif present in other vertebrate
FoxH orthologs, again suggesting a loss of the motif, perhaps due to functional specialization [see Additional files
1 and 2].

Characteristics of eh1-like motifs in Fox family proteins
For the eh1-like motifs identified, the amino acid frequency at each position of the motif was determined to
better define the characteristics of the motif in invertebrate and vertebrate members of the Fox gene family (Figure 2). For this frequency analysis, each position in the
motif is identified as 0 to 7 in an N-terminal to C-terminal
order. Although this analysis includes Fox proteins of evolutionary distant organisms, similar residue usage is
observed at most positions. Overall, the identified motifs
are characterized by the predominance of hydrophobic
residues. The aromatic residue, phenylalanine, is absolutely conserved (100%) at position 0 of the identified
motifs in vertebrates and in nearly all invertebrates. The
hydrophobic core of the motif (positions 2, 5 and 6) is
characterized by the frequent presence of branched hydrophobic residues such as isoleucine, leucine, methionine,
and, less frequently, valine. For both vertebrates and
invertebrates, isoleucine is highly represented at position
2 (75%), and leucine and isoleucine appear at similar frequencies (40–60%) at positions 5 and 6 in both invertebrates and vertebrates. Serine is highly represented at
position 1 (75%) in vertebrate Fox proteins, whereas serine (55%) and threonine (30%) predominate at this position in invertebrates. Although positions 3 and 4 are
variable, there is a strong bias for negatively charged residues at position 3 and the uncharged polar residues serine
and asparagine at position 4. Position 7 of the eh1-like
motifs is most variable, with glycine, alanine and serine
residues often present. It should be noted that within individual Fox subclasses, residue identity at each position is
more highly conserved, reflecting the evolutionary relatedness of the proteins in each subclass, as well as the conservation of subclass-specific functional and structural
properties of the motifs [see Additional files 2 and 3].

The conservation of multiple hydrophobic residues in the
eh1 motif is favorable for the formation of α-helices, and
suggests that the eh1-like motifs identified in Fox family
proteins have the potential to adopt a hydrophobic α-helical structure. To predict structural characteristics of the
motifs, several algorithms (DSC, PHD, MLRC) were used
to calculate the propensity of secondary structure formation [26-28]. For several Fox proteins of each subclass,

regions containing the eh1-like motif were analyzed for
predicted secondary structure. The results obtained using
multiple algorithms predict a high likelihood of α-helical
structure in the region of the eh1-like motif for the majority of Fox proteins examined. The highest scores for α-helical propensity were obtained for the eh1-like motifs
present in FoxB, FoxE and FoxQ proteins, and α-helical
structure was also predicted for FoxD, FoxA, FoxC and
FoxL proteins, albeit with lower propensity scores [see
Additional file 4 and data not shown].
In BLAST searches, the eh1-like motifs of several Fox proteins, including FoxB and FoxE proteins, show similarity
to the hydrophobic regions of several membrane proteins,
including the α-helical regions of the Chlorobium tepidum
segregation and condensation protein B (CHPfCT,
AAM71720), Pseudomonas aeruginosa probable transcriptional regulator Pa0477 (2ESND), and Drosophila ultraspiracle ligand-binding domain (ULBD, 1HG4F) (Figure 3A
and data not shown). A BLAST search for sequences
related to the N. vectensis Fox1 eh1-like motif identified
the α-helical region of Hepatitis C RNA Polymerase
(1YVZA) as the only related sequence (Figure 3B). The
ability of eh1-like sequences in proteins unrelated to the
Fox family to form α-helical structure supports the prediction of α-helical structure for the eh1-like motifs identified in Fox proteins.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/201

Helical wheel analysis of the predicted α-helical regions of
the eh1-like motifs revealed an amphipathicity for a
majority of the identified motifs. As an example of this
analysis, the helical wheel models of the eh1-like motifs
of FoxB1 and FoxE4 (Figure 3C,D) display a predicted
amphipathicity of the α-helical structure. For both eh1like motifs, a hydrophobic surface is formed by Isoleucine
residues at positions 2, 5 and 6 of the predicted α-helix.
The eh1-like motifs of a subset of FoxB1, FoxB2, FoxH1
and FoxQ1 proteins contain an additional hydrophobic
residue (Alanine or Methionine) at position 1 that
extends the hydrophobic surface of the predicted α-helix
(Figure 3C and data not shown). Opposite the hydrophobic surface of the predicted α-helix is a surface consisting
predominantly of hydrophilic and non-charged residues
(Figure 3C,D and data not shown). Thus, the majority of
the eh1-like motifs identified in Fox proteins have a predicted amphipathic α-helical structure. The validity of the
predicted eh1 structure is strongly supported by a recent
crystallographic study showing that the Goosecoid eh1
motif forms a short amphipathic α-helix when bound to
the WD domain of TLE1 [29].
Positional distribution of C-terminal eh1-like motifs
The eh1-like motifs identified in the Fox family were further analyzed for motif position within individual Fox
proteins. Given that nearly all of the eh1-like motifs identified in the Fox family are positioned C-terminal to the
WHD, we limited the analysis to C-terminal motifs. To
assess the variation in motif position within the C-terminus of Fox proteins, the positional distribution of the eh1like motifs relative to the WHD was examined. A substantial variation in the relative positions of the C-terminal
eh1-like motifs and the WHDs was found, with an interval
ranging from 30–180 residues (Figure 4). A detailed analysis of the positional distribution of these domains in 89
Fox protein sequences revealed two groups, C-proximal
and C-distal, defined by maximum interval occurrence
between the two domains. For the C-proximal eh1 motifs
the maximum interval occurrence is 45–60 residues with
a median value of 58 residues (Figure 4A). For the C-distal
motifs the maximum interval occurrence is 100–140 residues with a median value of 120 residues (Figure 4B).

Positional variation of the C-terminal eh1-like motifs was
also examined within Fox ortholog and paralog groups for
eight subclasses. This analysis was limited to chordate Fox
proteins as non-chordates lack many Fox subclasses. Proteins of Fox subclasses B, E, H and Q contain C-proximal
motifs, whereas C-distal motifs are present in Fox subclasses A, C, D and I. The positional distribution of the
motifs in the ortholog groups is shown in Figure 5. The
analysis indicates that the position of eh1-like motifs is
conserved within individual Fox protein subclasses across
species, but not across subclasses within individual spe-

cies. This conservation of motif position within each subclass is consistent with the existence of a common
ancestral gene for the Fox genes comprising an individual
subclass [17], but may also reflect a functional constraint
that maintains the position of the eh1 motif. Exceptions
to the conservation of motif position are observed for the
FoxD and FoxQ subclasses, and for orthologs of FoxA3,
FoxC1, and FoxH1. For the FoxD subclass, a shift of motif
position towards the C-terminus is observed for chick,
mouse and human proteins, when compared to amphixous, zebrafish and Xenopus (Figure 5A). A C-terminal shift
is also observed for the eh1 motifs of Xenopus, mouse and
human FoxQ proteins, compared to amphioxus and
zebrafish (Figure 5B). Similarly, for FoxC1 proteins, the
eh1 motif of the chick and mammalian orthologs is
shifted C-terminally in comparison to the zebrafish and
Xenopus orthologs. In contrast, the eh1 motif of mammalian FoxH1 proteins is shifted N-terminally, closer to the

domain of these mammalian Fox proteins is likely
responsible for the shift of eh1 motif position.

Discussion
In this study, we have identified the presence of eh1-like
Groucho interaction motifs in ten subclasses of the Fox
family of transcriptional regulators by systematically analyzing 458 protein sequences of nineteen Fox subclasses.
The analysis shows a widespread distribution of eh1-like
motifs within the Fox protein family. The presence of the
motif was identified in Fox subclasses, A, B, C, D, E, G, H,
I, L and Q, and no eh1-like motif was detected in proteins
of the F, J, K, M, N, O, P, R and S subclasses. The majority
of the eh1-like motifs identified were located C-terminal
to the WHD, including proteins of nine Fox subclasses (A,
B, C, D, E, H, I, L and Q). Only the FoxG subclass proteins
contained eh1-like motifs N-terminal in the WHD. For
Fox proteins containing C-terminal eh1-like motifs, the
position of the motif relative to the WHD defined a Cproximal group with motifs 45–60 residues from the
WHD (Fox subclasses B, E, H and Q) and a C-distal group
with motifs 100–140 residues from the WHD (Fox subclasses A, C, D and I). The presence of eh1 motifs in more
than 50% of Fox family proteins was in marked contrast
to other protein families, including both transcriptional
and non-transcriptional proteins (Table 4 and data not
shown).

WHD, in comparison to the zebrafish and Xenopus proteins.
For each case where eh1 motif position is not conserved,
the shift in motif position correlates with changes in the
size of the coding region C-terminal to the WHD. For
example, sequence alignment of FoxD subclass proteins
reveals the presence of polyalanine, polyglycine and polyproline repeats in the mammalian proteins that are absent
in FoxD proteins of lower vertebrates (data not shown).
On the other hand, mammalian FoxH1 proteins lack
sequences C-terminal to the WHD that are present in the
Xenopus and zebrafish orthologs (data not shown). Thus,
insertion or deletion of sequences within the C-terminal

The prevalence of eh1-like motifs in the Fox family suggests that Groucho corepressors directly interact with
many Fox proteins to mediate transcriptional repression
activity or to inhibit the activation function of other regulatory domains. In a number of cases the functional
importance of the identified eh1-like motifs is confirmed
by the presence of the motifs within defined transcriptional repression domains and by the ability to mediate
direct binding to Groucho proteins. The eh1 motifs are
present in the C-terminal repression domains of mouse
and chick FoxD3 [30,31], and Xenopus FoxD5 [32], as well
as the C-terminal transcriptional inhibitory domain of
mouse FoxC1 [33]. Furthermore, the eh1 motifs mediate
a functional and direct interaction with Groucho corepressors in mouse FoxA2 [19], Drosophila FoxG/sloppypaired-1 [20], mouse FoxG1 [34], and Xenopus FoxD3 [21]
and FoxH1 (SY and DSK, unpublished). These results confirm the importance of eh1 motifs in Fox family proteins,
and suggest that the eh1-like motifs identified in this
study may mediate a previously unappreciated interaction
of Groucho corepressors with many Fox proteins.
Secondary structure analysis of the eh1-like motifs indicates that a majority of the identified motifs are highly
likely to form an α-helical structure. In support of this secondary structure prediction, a number of the eh1-like
motifs exhibit sequence similarity to regions of unrelated

proteins with known α-helical structure. In addition, the
eh1-like motifs exhibit amphipathicity, which argues in
favor of α-helix formation by the motifs. Structural studies
of a number of transcriptional regulators have demonstrated the importance of amphipathic α-helices in binding to transcriptional coregulators. The p53 tumor
suppressor binds to the transcriptional coactivator,
MDM2, via a 13 amino acid motif. Structural studies have
shown that the MDM2 interaction motif of p53 forms an
amphipathic α-helix that binds to MDM2 through hydrophobic interactions [35]. In addition, NRSF/REST binds to
the Sin3 corepressor via several short amphipathic or
hydrophobic α-helices [3]. Therefore, the predicted
amphipathic α-helical structure of the eh1 motifs is likely
an essential feature for direct, high-affinity binding of Fox
proteins to Groucho corepressors. This conclusion is
strongly corroborated by recent structural studies showing
that the eh1 motif present in the human Goosecoid protein forms a short amphipathic α-helix when bound to
the WD domain of the Groucho family protein TLE1 [29].
In general, these observations support the idea that
diverse families of transcriptional regulators utilize distinct conserved motifs, which adopt a common amphipathic α-helical structure, as adaptors for the physical
interaction with transcriptional coregulators.
Eh1-like motifs were identified in Fox proteins of the most
evolutionary ancient organisms, including marine sponge
(porifera), comb jelly (ctenophora) and sea anemone
(cnidaria). The presence of the eh1-like motif in Fox proteins of these organisms likely reflects the presence of the
eh1-Groucho interaction functional module early in evolutionary history. Eh1-like motifs are also present in other
transcriptional regulators of the sponge, including the
Barx/Bsh1 (AAQ24371) and a paraHox-related homeodomain protein (CAD37941). Consistent with the presence
of eh1-like motifs in transcriptional regulatory proteins of
early divergent species, a Groucho gene (CN626783) has
been identified in the cnidarian Hydra. These data suggest
an ancient origin for eh1 motif-dependent recruitment of
Groucho corepressors, a protein interaction that may have
been established as early as the porifera.
An intriguing question raised by these analyses is the origins of the eh1 motifs in the Fox gene family. The motifs
identified in all Fox subclasses, except for the FoxG subclass, are positioned C-terminal to the WHD. The occurrence of the eh1-like motif N-terminal to the WHD in the
FoxG subclass and FoxQ2 suggests that the N-terminal
motif may have arisen independent of the C-terminal
motif. In addition, two eh1-like motifs, positioned N-terminal and C-terminal to the WHD, were identified in the
sea urchin and amphioxus FoxG1 proteins. The presence
of two motifs in distinct regions of a subset of FoxG1
orthologs is consistent with independent origins for the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/201

C-terminal and N-terminal eh1 motifs. Given the small
size of the eh1 motif (8 residues), it is possible that the
motif arose multiple times in the Fox family. Therefore,
the formation of new eh1-like motifs through the accumulation of missense mutations offers a convergent
mechanism for multiple independent appearances of the
motif in the Fox family. Alternatively, the Fox genes may
have acquired the motif via a non-homologous recombination event that introduced a repression module containing an eh1-like motif. Such a scenario could involve
the incorporation of a new exon encoding the repression
module. However, since a majority of the Fox family
genes lack introns, this mechanism would require intron
loss subsequent to incorporation of the eh1-encoding
exon.
An apparent loss of eh1 motifs was observed in a subset of
FoxD, FoxE, and FoxH proteins. Our analysis indicates
that the loss of the motif occurred in a subset of mammalian Fox proteins and we speculate that the motif loss provided a new functional modification for these proteins
that was evolutionarily beneficial. Since the presence of an
eh1 motif likely mediates a functional interaction with
Groucho corepressors, the loss of the motif may represent
an alteration of both transcriptional activity and regulatory function for individual Fox proteins. For example,
while FoxH1 proteins can function as transcriptional activators or repressors by recruitment of Smad coactivators
or Groucho corepressors [36,37] (SY and DSK, unpublished), it is predicted that FoxH3 functions exclusively as
an activator in association with Smad coactivators [38].
Thus, the eh1 motif may play an important role in the
evolution of the Fox gene family by providing a basis for
the evolutionary modification of Fox protein function.

Conclusion
The identification of eh1-like motifs in many members of
the Fox gene family provides an important insight into the
potential transcriptional activity of Fox family proteins,
and provides a foundation for the study of eh1 motif function in the Fox family. Biochemical and transcriptional
studies will now be necessary to determine if the identified eh1-like motifs mediate a direct physical interaction
with Groucho corepressors to confer transcriptional
repression activity. Building on our motif analyses, ongoing functional studies should yield a more comprehensive
understanding of the evolution, domain organization,
and transcriptional activity of the Fox gene family.

Methods
Manual sequence analysis
The Fox gene family is subdivided into nineteen subclasses on the basis of homology within the winged helix
DNA-binding domain [15], and at the time of this study
the nineteen subclasses comprised 458 sequences. To

identify eh1-like motifs, we used the eh1 consensus
sequence F0S/A+1Φ+2X+3X+4Φ+5Φ+6X+7 (Φ, branched
hydrophobic residues; X, non-polar or charged residues),
which has been generated based on the published data.
Yeast and metazoan Fox protein sequences present in the
SWISS-PROT and NCBI databases were analyzed. To identify the presence of an eh1-like motif in protein sequences
of the nineteen subclasses, we performed PSI-BLAST
searches of the non-redundant databases with inclusion
threshold (E-value) of 0.01 using members of each Fox
subclass as a query. In parallel, the sequences of all subclasses were retrieved from the NCBI database and multiple protein alignments were constructed for each subclass
using the CLUSTAL W algorithm in the software package
MacVector 7.2.2. Regions that were conserved within
either the N-terminal or C-terminal regions of at least two
species were examined for a minimum of 50% similarity
to the eh1 consensus. Taken together these searches
allowed for the identification of conserved sequences
matching the eh1 consensus in ten Fox subclasses.
Expectation-maximization and hidden Markov model
analyses
The expectation-maximization algorithm of the MEME
program (Multiple Em for Motif Elicitation, version 3.5.4)
[22,39] was used to analyze 458 proteins of the Fox family
for the presence of eh1-like motifs. The search parameters
used were 20–30 motifs per a run and a motif size of 8–
10 amino acid residues.

An eh1 motif position-specific probability matrix was
generated for a set of FoxD3 protein sequences using
MEME, and this matrix was used to construct a hidden
Markov model for eh1-like motifs using the Meta-MEME
program (Motif-based hidden Markov modeling of biological sequences, version 3.2) [24,40]. The SWISS protein
database was searched with the FoxD3 eh1-like motif
model using an E-value threshold of <104 for reported
sequences.
Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine
whether there was a statistically significant correlation
between the results of the hidden Markov model analysis
(log-odds scores) and all transcriptional proteins or Fox
family proteins specifically. The dependent variable in the
logistic regression analysis is the dummy variable (y),
which is equal to 1 when a transcriptional protein is
present and 0 otherwise. The independent variable is the
score (x). The estimated logistic regression equation is:

ˆ
y=

e a+bx

ˆ
, where x is the score and y is an estimate of
1 + e a+bx
the probability that y = 1 or that the transcription factor is
present given the score.

Phylogenic analysis of Fox proteins
A phylogenic tree for the FoxE subclass was generated
based on the winged-helix DNA-binding domain
sequences (100 residues) for FoxC, FoxD and FoxE subclass proteins. Multiple sequence alignments were constructed using Clustal W [41] and these sequences were
converted into a cladogram using MEGA 3.1 [42]. Distances were calculated with Poisson correction, and a
neighbor-joining method was used to construct the tree
topology with bootstrap analysis of 1000 samples.
Secondary structure analysis
For secondary structure predictions, the C-terminal or Nterminal domain of selected Fox proteins of each subclass
was subjected to analysis using algorithms that predict
secondary structure with accuracy in the range of 0.67–
0.7. The prediction algorithm is available at the Network
Protein Sequence Analysis website [43]. The source code
of the combiner can be obtained on request for academic
use. In addition, software written by M.L. (unpublished)
was used to predict the secondary structure of Fox protein
sequences. This helix prediction algorithm is based on all
high-resolution structures available, with the scoring
function comparing homology of the sequences to known
helical structures.
