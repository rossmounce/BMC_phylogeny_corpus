Abstract
Background: Retrotransposons are heterogeneous sequences, widespread in eukaryotic
genomes, which refer to the so-called mobile DNA. They resemble retroviruses, both in their
structure and for their ability to transpose within the host genome, of which they make up a
considerable portion. Copia- and Gypsy-like retrotransposons are the two main classes of
retroelements shown to be ubiquitous in plant genomes. Ideally, the retrotransposons life cycle
results in the synthesis of a messenger RNA and then self-encoded proteins to process
retrotransposon mRNA in double stranded extra-chromosomal cDNA copies which may integrate
in new chromosomal locations.
Results: The RT-PCR and IRAP protocol were applied to detect the presence of Copia and Gypsy
retrotransposon transcripts and of new events of integration in unstressed plants of a sunflower
(Helianthus annuus L.) selfed line. Results show that in sunflower retrotransposons transcription
occurs in all analyzed organs (embryos, leaves, roots, and flowers). In one out of sixty-four
individuals analyzed, retrotransposons transcription resulted in the integration of a new element
into the genome.
Conclusion: These results indicate that the retrotransposon life cycle is firmly controlled at a post
transcriptional level. A possible silencing mechanism is discussed.

Background
The mobile component of the genome is represented by
sequences, called transposable elements (TEs), which are
potentially able to change their chromosomal location
(transposition) through different mechanisms. This feature has a cladistic significance and TEs are subdivided
into two main classes accordingly to their mechanism of
transposition, retrotransposons (REs, class I) and DNA
transposons (class II). Class I elements, which includes all
REs, can transpose through a replicative mechanism

which involves the transcription of an RNA intermediate
by the enzyme machinery of the host cell, and subsequent
retrotranscription to cDNA and integration into the host
genome by the enzymes encoded by the retrotransposon
RNA. Such a "copy and paste" mechanism has been
largely successful during the evolution of eukaryotes in
which class I elements represent the largest portion of
higher plant genomes. In the case of Oryza australiensis,
the amplification of retrotransposons doubled the
genome size [1].

Retrotransposons are divided into autonomous and nonautonomous elements, according to the presence of ORFs
that encode RE enzymes. Non-autonomous elements do
not carry enough coding capacity to allow them to transpose autonomously, nevertheless they are able to move
using enzymes encoded by other elements [2].
Basically, the genome of autonomous REs is organized in
two domains: the gag domain, which is committed
towards the production of virus like particles, and the pol
domain, whose encoded enzymes are used for processing
RE-mRNA and obtaining a double stranded DNA to be
integrated into the genome. The occurrence of long terminal repeats (LTRs) flanking the retrotransposon genome
distinguishes REs into two main classes, namely LTR- and
non-LTR-retrotransposons. LTRs carry promoter elements,
polyadenilation signals and enhancers regulating the transcription of retroelements.
Gypsy and Copia LTR retrotransposons are two ubiquitous
classes [3,4] of plant REs that differ in the order of genes
encoded by pol. Gypsy and Copia elements resemble retroviruses in their structure due to the presence of LTRs and
internal ORFs. LTR-retrotransposons lacking internal coding domains, such as TRIMs (Terminal-repeat Retrotransposons In Miniature [5]) and LARDs (LArge
Retrotransposons Derivatives [6]) have also been
described. Formerly discovered in Solanum tuberosum and
Arabidopsis, TRIMs have been reported in monocots and
dicots while LARDs, which were shown to be transcribed,
have been reported in Triticeae [4,6].
Over the last two decades, some examples have correlated
the emerging of RE activity in the genome with a stress
mediated reaction: Tnt1 and Tto1 in Nicotiana and Tos17
in rice showed stress-induced (by tissue culture) transcription and transposition [7-10], while these elements were
not transcribed in standard culture conditions.
Large genome sequencing of grass plants showed that REs
are responsible for extensive changes in genome structure
and, surprisingly, dramatic differences were reported even
among individuals belonging to the same species [11,12].
A remarkable example of retrotransposon dynamics as an
evolutionary adaptive mechanism within an ecological
system is offered by BARE1 elements in wild barley [13].
It has been proposed that REs restructuring action plays a
role in regulating gene expression [14,15]. It has been suggested that allelic variation in non-genic (regulatory)
sequence may be involved in heterosis, i.e. the superior
performance of hybrids in respect of their parents [16]. In
this sense, the old epithet of "junk" for such repeated
sequences, which have affected genome structure and
function, is becoming obsolete.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/150

Though the interplay between REs and host genome has
allowed genome expansion and the evolution of the gene
expression regulating network, the vast majority of REs
seem to be inactivated by a large spectrum of mutations.
Only few elements have been shown to transpose autonomously and data from EST libraries in grasses indicate
that most are poorly transcribed [17-19]. However, it is
conceivable that the activity of REs should be limited by
the host genome because of their potential mutagenic
action.
The control of TEs activity is related to RNA interference,
a process mediated by small RNAs which derive from a
number of different precursors, determining chromatin
specific methylation and condensation, and RNA degradation [20]. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe,
a basal level of transcripts matching centromeric DNA
repeats is the substrate for the production of small RNAs
that maintain heterochromatin structure through histone
methylation [21]. A silencing pathway of REs and repetitive sequences, driven by anti-sense small RNAs, is well
described in Drosophila [22] and in Arabidopsis [23].
In plants, retrotransposon dynamics have mainly been
investigated in grasses and other monocotyledons, and in
dicotyledons such as Arabidopsis, Gossypium species, Nicotiana, and Lotus japonicus. Recently, genome expansion
related to the amplification of REs has been shown to
occur in the evolution of three Helianthus hybrid species
adapted to extreme environments [24,25].
The cultivated sunflower (Helianthus annuus) has a
medium-large sized genome (3.30 pg DNA per haploid
genome [26]. The occurrence of Copia and Gypsy REs has
been reported a few years ago for the first time [27] and,
lately, the main portion of sunflower genome was shown
to be composed by REs [28]. The analysis of cpDNA suggested that the Helianthus genus originated between 4.75
and 22.7 million years ago while the Helianthus extant lineages appeared between 1.7 and 8.2 million years ago
[29].
With the aim to study RE activity in a relatively young and
medium-large genome sized species, we have analyzed
retrotransposons transcription and integration of new REs
in plants of cultivated sunflower.

Results
REs expression in the Helianthus annuus genome
Sunflower repeated sequences were previously isolated
from a Helianthus annuus partial genomic library by
hybridization with labeled genomic DNA [27]. Among
these, one Copia-like sequence (pHaS211 [EMBL acc.
number AJ009967], hereafter called C211) and three
Gypsy-like sequences (pHaS13 [AJ532592], pHaS22

[FM208278], and pHaS30 [FM208279], hereafter called
G13, G22, and G30, respectively) resulted as being
medium repeated, with a copy number per haploid
genome ranging from 4,000 to 16,000 (Cavallini, unpublished). These sequences were studied with respect to their
RNA transcription.
Specific PCR primers were designed on conserved
domains matching the RNAseH and the Integrase gene of
Copia and Gypsy elements, respectively. RT-PCR experiments were performed to assess the occurrence of RE transcripts in different organs such as root, leaf, flower (at
three different stages) and embryo (at four different
stages), collected from HCM line plants. For each organ
and stage, amplified fragments of the expected length

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/150

were obtained (Fig. 1), indicating that the retroelement
families studied are actively transcribed in all the organs
analyzed. Additional PCR products were obtained, that
might have been originated by the transcription of retrotransposon remnants and/or related elements.
Three amplified fragments for each RT-PCR product were
cloned and sequenced (EMBL acc. numbers FM208268FM208277). Sequences belonging to the Copia-like element did not show sequence polymorphism (Table 1).
This may indicate that only one or a few Copia REs belonging to C211 family are transcribed, so that polymorphism
cannot be detected by sequencing only three PCR products. All nine sequences belonging to Gypsy-like REs were

non-retrotranscribed RNA (C). Molecular weight marker (M, Gene Ruler DNA Ladder Mix, Fermentas) was also loaded.

different, indicating that different elements of all analyzed
Gypsy-like families are transcribed.
Eight out of the nine Gypsy sequences and the Copia ones
do not show stop codons. In spite of the low number of
sequences analyzed, this result indicates that many of the
expressed REs encode functional protein sequences.
Within the G13, G22, and G30 families, the ratio between
synonymous and non synonymous substitutions was
0.071, 0.086, and 0.189, respectively, i.e., close to zero
(Table 1). Such low ratios are usually found in coding
gene sequences and they indicate conservative selection. A
BLAST search on EST databases using sequences of three
Gypsy and one Copia REs as queries, indicated that RE families related to those analyzed in our experiments are transcribed also in other Asteraceae species (Table 2) for
which EST data are available, both belonging to the Helianthusgenus (H. argophyllus, H. ciliaris, H. exilis, H. paradoxus, H. tuberosus) or to other genera (Artemisia annua,
Senecio cambrensis, S. chrisanthemifolius, S. vulgaris, Carthamus tinctorius, Centaurea solstitialis, Cichorium intybus, Lactuca perennis, L. sativa, L. serriola, Zinnia elegans).

Isolation and analysis of LTRs
Putative full-length Gypsy-like LTRs were isolated by twostep chromosome walking, following the method
reported for sunflower Copia-like LTRs [30].

Twelve putative Gypsy LTRs (EMBL acc. numbers
FM177929-FM177940) and 18 putative Copia LTR
(FM177911 - FM177928[30]) were aligned and a consensus tree, based on nucleotide sequences, was obtained by
the neighbor-joining analysis (Fig. 2). The tree showed a
clear distinction between Gypsy and Copia LTRs. Moreover,
Copia LTRs resulted to be more uniform than Gypsy ones
(Table 3), for which three distinct families are observed
(Fig. 2). Calculation of nucleotide diversity along the relatively uniform Copia LTRs indicated that diversity is
higher in the central region of LTR than at both ends (not
shown).
CLUSTAL alignment clearly showed conserved putative
TATA box promoter both in the Gypsy (TATAAA) and in
the Copia (TATATATA) LTRs. To analyze the structure of a
putative RE promoter, isolated Copia and Gypsy LTRs were

scanned for cis-elements against the PLACE database [31].
In all the LTRs analyzed, stress-responsive cis-elements as
Myb, Myc, and WRKY motifs were found. Cis-elements
typical of constitutively expressed genes such as Dofrelated elements [32] and CACT boxes [33] were
observed. Also many putative light responsive elements,
such as GATA boxes and GT1 binding sites [34], tissuespecific motifs such as SEF3 binding sites [35], were found
in all the LTRs analyzed. All these elements may account
for the observed RE expression. It is to be noted that similar cis-elements can be observed in both strands of analyzed LTRs.

lated in other HCM plants using primers designed on the
inter-retrotransposon sequence and it showed 100% similarity with the same locus related to the polymorphic
band. To assess whether Copia LTRs flanked this locus in
plants of the HCM line, PCRs were performed with primers pointing outward from the genomic locus (Fig. 4). Of
the two possible amplified fragments, only one was
obtained of the expected molecular weight, containing a
portion of 5'- LTR, indicating the occurrence of a Copia
element in that side of the locus. This suggests that a new
Copia retrotransposon had inserted itself in the embryo on
the other side of the locus.

Insertion of new REs in the genome
To investigate whether Copia and Gypsy transcriptional
activity leads to the integration of daughter copies in the
genome of Helianthus annuus, the IRAP protocol [36] was
applied to detect polymorphisms within the HCM line.
This sunflower line was subject to eighteen self-pollination cycles, thus it is to be considered as homozygous as
indicated by the phenotype uniformity. Since the IRAP
protocol displays RE fingerprinting arising from the
amplification of neighbour LTRs, new integrated copies of
LTR-retroelements can produce polymorphic bands if
they insert themselves close enough to a second element,
to be amplified by Taq DNA polymerase.

Discussion

To detect RE-related polymorphisms, primers were
designed on the 5'- and the 3'-LTRs ends of Copia and
Gypsy elements. Since RE insertions are mutagenic and the
development of plantlets might be aborted, new events of
RE integration were surveyed in sunflower embryos from
four inflorescences, one for each developmental stage.
Sixty-four embryos (7, 14, 21, or 28 days after pollination) were tested, using specific Copia- and Gypsy-LTR
primers, respectively. Only a combination of LTR specific
primers (FF C-LTR/C-LTR2), matching a Copia retroelement, produced a clear polymorphic band in a 14 day old
embryo (Fig. 3). This band was recovered from the gel,
and then cloned and sequenced (EMBL acc. number
FM209477). The sequence was found to be delimited by
the two primers; 3'-Copia LTR and 5'-Copia LTR ends were
present, excluding unspecific primer annealing. The
sequence between the two LTRs (665 bp long) was iso-

McClintock [37] addressed the presence and activity of
mobile elements within the host as a chance for the
genome to cope with challenges to which it is not prepared to react. The genome restructuring action of mobile
elements should have made available further genetic variability, increasing the possibility to overcome the challenge.
In the present work, RT-PCR experiments have demonstrated that the Copia and the Gypsy REs families investigated are transcribed in all Helianthus annuus analyzed
tissues, i.e. roots, leaves and flowers. Transcripts showed a
very low level of non synonymous/synonymous substitution rates. Similar ratios were reported for Copia, Gypsy,
and LINE REs also in other Asteraceae, as Hieracium aurantiacum, Taraxacum officinale and Antennaria parlinii, suggesting a conservative selection [38]. Nine out of ten REmRNA transcripts did not show any supernumerary stop
codon, supporting the presence of a potentially functional
segment of RE pol-proteins. That "parasite" sequences
with no apparent function for the host genome tend to
maintain their amino acid sequence may be somewhat
unexpected. A possible explanation is that only recently
inserted elements (i.e., those which have not been subject
to mutations yet) are functional.
BLAST screening against EST databases has shown that
transcripts related to these REs families are largely transcribed in different Helianthus species and in other Asteraceae. Interestingly, G13 and G22 matches are distributed

in several species belonging to different genera. It should
be noted that, in other dicots, retrotransposon ESTs were
reported to find matches only in their host species [18].
The isolation and sequencing of a number of full length
Copia and Gypsy 5'-LTRs showed the occurrence of a
proper TATA box and putative cis-elements in their
sequence. Transcripts were isolated using a poly-T primer
targeting the 3'-poli-A tail, showing that the 3'-ends of RE
transcripts were processed by the host genome. The occurrence of promoter sequences, of functional protein
sequences, the RE transcription and the RE-mRNA 3'-end
processing are all hints of autonomous retrotransposons.
It is known that REs are subject to inactivation by either
mutations or chromatin condensation. Replication allows
these elements to survive as genome parasites, but the
higher the replication rate the lower will be the host fitness and, consequently, survival of the REs. In the sun-

flower, although the expression of REs is widespread in all
the tissues analyzed, IRAP experiments revealed only one
convincing polymorphism, which was attributable to a
new integration event. This suggests that, despite a substantial transcriptional activity, RE-mRNAs are quelled
and the insertion of new REs is inhibited at a post-transcriptional level, as shown in other species including
humans (see [20]).
The amplification of REs in the genome can have some
functions for the host. For example, the occurrence in the
LTR of putative promoter elements such as those observed
in the sunflower could be used by the host to regulate the
expression of nearby genes. Constitutively active LTR promoters could determine a housekeeping expression, while
tissue-specific LTR promoters would drive the expression
of genes in those tissues. An example of gene transcription
related to the activity of adjacent retrotransposons was
reported in wheat [39]. In mouse oocytes, retrotranspo-

son related transcripts are predominant in the mRNA pool
and LTR promoters are responsible for the transcription of
a set of genes [40].
The ubiquity of RE transcripts observed in sunflower tissues, and the fact that REs are actively transcribed in standard culture conditions, can support the idea that
retrotransposons can be integrated into cell metabolism.
For instance, a basal level of retrotransposons transcription would make available the "rough material", namely
dsRNAs, that can trigger RE silencing via RNA-directed
DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling [41] or via
a post-transcriptional mechanism [23]. Double stranded
RNA precursors may originate from transcribed nested,
head-to-tail oriented LTRs [39], from read-through transcription of two elements which are head-to-tail oriented
or from anti-sense strand transcription [42-44].
In this sense, low-copy elements would be the most hazardous for the host, because of the rareness of head-to-tail
orientation in the genome, so reducing the efficiency of
silencing mechanisms. Accordingly, the few elements in
plants for which new insertion events were shown, are
three Copia-like elements, Tnt1, Tto1, and Tos17, present in
a relatively low copy number (< 1,000) per haploid
genome (see [45]).
Previous analyses of sunflower REs revealed that they are
highly methylated [28]. The families of REs investigated in
this study are present in several thousands of copies

within the genome and are possibly methylated. However, the widespread transcription of such elements suggests that RE silencing in this species occurs also by
degradation of RE mRNAs.

Conclusion
Retrotransposon transcription was shown in all sunflower
tissues analyzed in our experiments. RE activity is not
apparently induced by environmental factors or by culture
conditions. In one over 64 surveyed embryos a new RE
insertion occurred, possibly determining a mutation.
We can speculate that in the sunflower the rarity of insertion events, observed in our experiments despite the consistent transcriptional activity of the Copia and Gypsy RE
families investigated, would be linked to post-transcriptional regulation of REs activity, probably through the
degradation of target RE mRNAs.

Methods
Plant materials, DNA and RNA extraction
Roots, leaves, embryos, and flowers were collected from
plants of the HCM line of Helianthus annuus, grown in the
field. The HCM line was developed at the Dept. of Crop
Plant Biology of University of Pisa after 18 self-pollination cycles, starting from an open-pollinated cultivar, and
it is a highly homozygous line, as indicated by phenotype
uniformity. Self-pollination was obtained by covering
inflorescences to prevent outcrossing. After sampling, tissues were ground in liquid nitrogen. DNA was extracted

from embryos and leaves using a CTAB protocol [46] with
minor modifications. For total RNA extraction, a MESguanidine hydrochloride-containing buffer was used following the protocol described by Logeman et al. [47].
RNA purification
A tuned RNA purification protocol was tailored to avoid
genomic DNA contamination, i.e., DNA remnants invalidating RT-PCR analyses. Such a high level of accuracy is
crucial especially when analyzing RE expression because
of the high frequency of REs in the genomes.

RNA was purified by treatment with DNAse I (Roche). The
total amount of DNAse units was set according to the
maximum amount of glycerol allowed in the reaction
mixture, i.e. 25 μg total RNA, 10 × DNAse I incubation
buffer 5 μl, RNAse-free recombinant DNAse I 100 units
(10 μl total volume, 5 μl glycerol volume), DEPC water up
to 50 μl. Samples were incubated for 1 h at 37°C. After
DNAse treatment, RNA purification required a phenolchloroform extraction and standard precipitation with 1/
10 volume 3 M sodium acetate and 2 volumes of cold,
100% ethanol. Using this protocol any possible genomic
DNA contamination was prevented [see Additional file 1].
Expression analyses by RT-PCR
For retrotranscription, total RNA (5 μg) was heated for 3
min at 70°C and retrotranscribed in a 20 μl volume reaction using 400 μM of each deoxynucleotide triphosphate,
0.25 μM poly(T) primer, 1×RT-Buffer, 1 mM DTT, 200 U
SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies).
The same quantity of RNA was processed as above but in
the absence of the reverse transcriptase and used as a negative control in RT-PCR.

original alignment were generated using the SEQBOOT
program; then trees were generated using PROTDIST (or
DNADIST) and NEIGHBOR programs, using default
options. A strict consensus tree was obtained from the
available trees using the CONSENSE program.
Isolation of Gypsy LTRs
To isolate full length Gypsy LTRs a two-step PCR protocol
was applied [30]. Firstly, putative partial 3' LTR chromosome walking was performed: specific retrotransposon
forward primers designed onto a conserved domain
belonging to a Gypsy Integrase gene (GenBank Acc. Nr.
AJ532592) (Gypsy ChWp4, Table 4) were coupled with a
random annealing reverse primer (5'-ACCATCGTCCTCAGGTTAGTCAGG-3', Ra A-P). PCR products were
amplified using 30 ng DNA, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 μM primers, 1 U Taq FirePol (Biodyne) DNA polymerase, 20 μl
volume reaction. Thermocycling was performed at 94°C
for 30 s, 60°C for 30 s and 72°C for 2 min, for 30 cycles.
Products longer than 1,000 bp were cloned and
sequenced as above. Clustal analyses were performed to
address putative polypurine tract (PPT) whose location is
usually a couple of nucleotides before the 3' LTR beginning. Due to the remarkable LTR sequence variability and
the lack of large conserved sequence traits, at this stage the
3' boundaries of the 3' LTR within the sequenced clones
could not be determined.

In the second step, isolation of complete 5' LTRs was performed. As the retrotransposon LTRs were made identical
before the retroelement genome integration, primers
designed in the 3'LTR would be expected to match both
LTRs. Therefore, specific forward primers were designed
downstream of the putative PPT matching Gypsy-like 3'
LTR, (P1FGypsy and P2FGypsy respectively at bases 51-75
and bases 84-109 after the canonical 5 ' TG) and coupled
with a universal primer designed onto the primer binding
site (PBS) related to the tRNAmet sequence pointing
towards the 5' LTR (PBSmet, 5'-TAGGTCGGAACAGGCTCTGATACCA-3' [52]). Thermocycling was performed
at 94°C for 30 s, 57°C for 30 s and 72°C for 60 s, for 30
cycles. PCR products resulting from a semi- nested PCR
between P2FGypsy- and PBS-primer were visualized on
EtBr-stained agarose gel, cloned as above and sequenced.
IRAP protocol
Ten primers were designed on Copia and Gypsy LTR ends
(Table 4). Embryos DNAs were amplified using 20 ng
DNA, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.25 μM primers, 1 U Taq FirePol
(Biodyne) DNA polymerase, 20 μl volume reaction. Thermocycling was performed at 94°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s,
and 72°C for 150 s. PCR products were visualized on 2%
EtBr-stained agarose gel.

Polymorphic band analysis
A polymorphic fragment was recovered from the gel,
cloned in pGEM T-easy vector using the manufacturer's
instructions, and sequenced. Specific primers (EMB 1F,
EMB 1R, Table 4) were designed to amplify the same
genomic locus in individuals of the same HCM line by
PCR, using 30 ng DNA, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 μM primers
final concentration, 1 U Taq FirePol (Biodyne) DNA
polymerase, 20 μl volume reaction. Thermocycling was
performed at 94°C for 30 s, 60°C for 30 s, 72°C for 2
min. Primers (EMB 2F, EMB 2R, Table 4) were designed
on the polymorphic isolated locus. The LTR primers (FF
C-LTR, C-LTR2, Table 4) were coupled with EMB 2F and
EMB 2R, and PCR was performed using the same reaction
mixture as above, at 94°C for 30 s, 57°C for 30 s, 72°C
for 1 min. PCR products were cloned as above and
sequenced.
