Background
Due to their very high economic importance, Eucalyptus
tree species are among the most planted hardwoods in
the world with over 20 million hectares. However, as
long-lived evergreen species, this genus is particularly
exposed to cold. Frost tolerance varies among species
and is inversely correlated to productivity. The AP2/ERF
gene family includes developmentally and physiologically
important transcription factors characterized by the presence of the AP2/ERF DNA-binding domain. AP2 proteins contain two AP2-like domains and RAV family
proteins contain one AP2 domain and one B3 domain.
ERF family proteins exhibit only one AP2 domain and
are further divided into the DREB subfamily and the
ERF subfamily [1]. The CBF/DREB1 protein differ from
the other DREB proteins by the presence of “signature
sequences” (PKK/RPAGRxKFxETRHP and DSAWR)
flanking the DNA-binding AP2 domain [2]. The DREB
factors recognize the C-repeat or dehydration response
element (DRE) in the promoters of low temperature
and/or water deficit responsive genes and would play a
crucial role in response to abiotic stresses. CBF/DREB1
are the key regulators of the cold-responsive (COR)
genes. So far CBF transcription factors have been mainly
characterized in model plants such as Arabidopsis, but
lately they were identified in several tree species including Eucalyptus [2]. The Eucalyptus cold tolerance was
greatly improved in our hands when two genes from the
four CBF members isolated from a tolerant species
E. gunnii were individually constitutively overexpressed
in the frost sensitive E. urophylla x E. grandis hybrid
[3]. In the present study E. grandis AP2/ERF family

genes were identified based on the presence of putative
encoding AP2-domain(s) and were studied with regard
to the model herbaceous Arabidopsis as well as the
main sequenced woody plants. Within this family, a part
of the study focused on the CBF/DREB1 subfamily
which was compared to the four genes already characterized in E. gunnii[2].

Methods
We used the available annotated E. grandis genome
sequence at phytozome (http://www.phytozome.net/
eucalyptus.php), the Arabidopsis thaliana AP2/ERF
family downloaded from the DATF (Database of Arabidopsis Transcription Factors) database website (http://
datf.cbi.pku.edu.cn/), and the sequences of AP2/ERF
gene family from the grapevine, and the poplar obtained
from several publications. In order to get the exhaustive
gene AP2 family and the location of the genes of the E.
grandis genome, we used Scipio [4]. Every identified
protein was analyzed for structural motifs by scanning
them against PROSITE patterns and profiles (http://
www.expasy.org/prosite) and against Pfam (http://pfam.
sanger.ac.uk/) to make sure of the presence of AP2
and/or the B3 domains. A fine correction of the predicted AP2/ERF proteins was performed. In order to
identify all the members of CBF subfamily, a search
within the E. grandis annotated AP2/ERF family was
performed using consensus sequence including the two
highly conserved signatures (PKKPAGR and DSAWR)
surrounding the DNA-binding AP2-domain. As a check,
we confirmed by blasting the sequences on the
NCBI blast page. From a multiple alignment analysis
performed with Clustal W, the phylogenetic trees
were generated using MEGA version 5. The resulting

phylogenetic trees were based on the maximum likelihood (ML) method [5].

Results and main conclusions
Based on the sequence alignement, the phylogenetic
analyses, and the known criteria described in litterature,
this study revealed that the annotated AP2 genes from
E. grandis were divided into the four subgroups already
described for Arabidopsis (DREB, ERF subfamilies, AP2
subfamily and RAV subfamily). The two subfamilies
DREB and ERF were separated according to the similarity of the sequences of the AP2/ERF domain and to the
amino acid at 14 and 19 positions. Distribution of the
DREB members in the four dicotyledonous plant genomes (Vitis, Arabidopsis, Populus and Eucalyptus)
shows similarities between grapevine and E. grandis
except for the A1 subgroup which corresponds to the
CBF genes. Interestingly this group is much larger in
E. grandis compared to the three other plant species.
The 17 CBF genes (including one pseudogene) identified
on E. grandis genome exhibit a very good conservation
when compared to the E. gunnii CBF genes. The
E. grandis CBF genes could be classified into the four
groups (a, b, c et d) described for E. gunnii CBF. Most
of the EgrCBF were localized on the chromosome 1, one
member is on the chromosome 4 and the last two on
the chromosome 5.
