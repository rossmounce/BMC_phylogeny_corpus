Abstract
Background: Microarray technology has become highly valuable for identifying complex global
changes in gene expression patterns. The effective correlation of observed changes in gene
expression with shared transcription regulatory elements remains difficult to demonstrate
convincingly. One reason for this difficulty may result from the intricate convergence of both
transcriptional and mRNA turnover events which, together, directly influence steady-state mRNA
levels.
Results: In order to investigate the relative contribution of gene transcription and changes in
mRNA stability regulation to standard analyses of gene expression, we used two distinct
microarray methods which individually measure nuclear gene transcription and changes in polyA
mRNA gene expression. Gene expression profiles were obtained from both polyA mRNA (wholecell) and nuclear run-on (newly transcribed) RNA across a time course of one hour following the
activation of human Jurkat T cells with PMA plus ionomycin. Comparative analysis revealed that
regulation of mRNA stability may account for as much as 50% of all measurements of changes in
polyA mRNA in this system, as inferred by the absence of any corresponding regulation of nuclear
gene transcription activity for these groups of genes. Genes which displayed dramatic elevations in
both mRNA and nuclear run-on RNA were shown to be inhibited by Actinomycin D (ActD) pretreatment of cells while large numbers of genes regulated only through altered mRNA turnover
(both up and down) were ActD-resistant. Consistent patterns across the time course were
observed for both transcribed and stability-regulated genes.
Conclusion: We propose that regulation of mRNA stability contributes significantly to the
observed changes in gene expression in response to external stimuli, as measured by high
throughput systems.

Background
Virtually all microarray studies to-date have measured
changes in steady-state mRNA levels by harvesting total
cellular RNA and using it to generate probes through a
variety of strategies including end-labeling of purified
mRNA [1], incorporating a label into the first strand
cDNA made from mRNA [2], or attaching a T7 RNA
polymerase promoter during cDNA synthesis, then labeling of the resulting RNA [3]. More recently, several
groups have demonstrated the feasibility of hybridizing
metabolically labeled mRNAs directly from nuclear runon (NRO) reactions to nylon filter microarrays in order to
investigate nascent transcripts [1,4-6]. Schuhmacher et al.
[5], in particular, used a B cell line carrying a conditional,
tetracycline-regulated myc gene, and found that myc
induction resulted in only a small overlap in regulated
mRNAs at 4 hours post-induction when comparing polyA
mRNA and NRO RNA on microarrays. This early work
provided evidence that transcriptional activation of genes
does not necessarily lead to a corresponding increase of
their steady-state mRNA levels.
More recently, our laboratory has examined the relationship between newly transcribed (NRO) RNA and polyA
mRNA in a stress model using human non-small lung carcinoma H1299 cells. In response to a variety of stresses
(ultraviolet light, heat shock, or prostaglandin), we found
that approximately half of the observed changes in mRNA
levels of stress-regulated genes were accompanied by a
corresponding increase or decrease in gene transcription
as measured by NRO. The remaining half of stress-altered
changes in gene expression was largely attributable to
changes in mRNA turnover, thus suggesting that, on a global level, changes in mRNA turnover profoundly influence gene expression patterns [6].
Several questions, however, remained to be answered
from these earlier studies. Since in both the myc induction
and stress experiments, as mentioned above, measurements of both newly transcribed and polyA mRNAs were
made at a single time point, there existed a reasonable
possibility of temporal disjunctions between the timing of
mRNA new gene synthesis and the rates of accumulation
of mRNA in the cell. The second question remaining
unanswered is whether or not highly significant levels of
mRNA stability regulation (> 50% of all measured gene
expression in the stress example) is common to different
biological model systems. In order to begin to address
these questions we investigated changes at the levels of
transcription and total cellular mRNA abundance simultaneously across a time course of activation using Jurkat T
cells.
T-cell activation is one of the most widely studied models
of cellular response to exogenous stimulation. The initial

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/75

events include rapid signaling via protein-protein interactions, phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of target signaling molecules, and release of Ca2+ from intracellular
stores. Subsequent activation of signal transduction cascades culminates in the implementation of gene expression patterns characteristic of the immune response.
Initial microarray studies using T cells have focused on
gene expression changes occurring several hours after activation [7-13], even though earlier work using more traditional methods had defined the commitment period for
T-cell activation, including alteration in gene expression
patterns, as occurring between 1–2 h after exposure to the
activating agent [14]. In order to investigate these earlier
gene expression changes we chose to examine a time
course of activation spanning the first hour after stimulation. While a recent study by Garcia-Martinez et al. [15] in
yeast using a similar approach demonstrated large shifts
in mRNA stability following a glucose-to-galactose shift,
the work presented here is the first systematic accounting
of the changes in both gene transcription and mRNA stability in response to a major cellular activation event over
a defined time period in higher eukaryotes.

Results
T-cell commitment is believed to occur early during activation and therefore changes in gene expression during
the earliest stages of induction are of particular interest.
An experimental model using human Jurkat T cells activated with PMA and ionomycin was used to investigate
early changes in gene expression (up to one hour of stimulation), focusing on both changes in mRNA transcription rates as well as polyA mRNA levels. One hour was
chosen in order to examine gene regulatory events occurring immediately after activation and to avoid, for the
most part, the influence of secondary gene regulatory
mechanisms taking place at later time points (e.g.,
increased synthesis of transcription factors). NRO RNA
was prepared from isolated cell nuclei (Methods) and
polyA mRNA from intact cells. Figure 1 shows an example
of filter images obtained after hybridization of arrays
using either NRO RNA or polyA mRNA. Cells stimulated
for 30 minutes exhibited moderate changes in gene
expression in the mRNA arrays. In contrast, NRO RNA
arrays revealed rapid and robust changes in transcription
that were evident as early as 5 minutes following induction. Unexpectedly, a careful analysis of all significant
changes in gene expression across the time course revealed
that these early-response genes (as identified by NRO)
were a relatively small subset of all of the genes shown to
be regulated (see below).
In all, a total of 4608 genes, including sets of genes
enriched for immune response and signal transduction
function, were polled (Fig. 2). Of these genes, 2386
showed significant regulation (p < 0.001, or Z ratio > ±

The single most common expression event (55.2 %) was
an up or down regulation at one or more time points as
measured in mRNA without a corresponding (either up or
down) regulation as measured by transcription at any
time point. The second largest group of regulated genes
(27.4%) showed changes in transcription with no corresponding change in polyA mRNA. Examples of genes dramatically up-regulated in this second class included
CD69, a type II transmembrane receptor involved in lymphocyte proliferation and a classic marker of early T cell
activation; PPP3C, the catalytic subunit of the calmodulin-activated phosphatase, calcineurin, which plays a central role in signal transduction from the T cell receptor to
the nucleus; as well as several members of the JUN family
of transcription factor immediate early response genes
(Fig. 3A).
The final, relatively minor groups of regulated genes
included genes which were regulated at both the transcriptional and the polyA mRNA levels in either the same
(8.4%) or opposite directions (9%). The relatively low
concordance between transcriptional production of
mRNA and its measured appearance in polyA mRNA levels was somewhat surprising, although clear examples of
coordinated step-wise production were noted for some
key genes, as for example, the early response genes EGR1
and ETR101 (previously shown to be induced at 30 minutes by phorbol ester treatment of a human promyelocytic
leukemia cell line [16] and, the apoptosis-related genes
DAP (death-associated protein, mediator of interferongamma-induced apoptosis) and CASP3, as well as the
immune response signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 6 (Fig. 3A).
Dramatic activation of immune response, immediateearly response genes, and apoptosis-related genes was
observed in the nuclear run-on RNA as early as 5 minutes
following activation (Fig. 3A). This group of genes
included immediate-early response genes commonly upregulated during cellular activation (ETR101, Myb, Myc,
and genes of the JUN and EGR families), genes specifically
associated with an early response in immune cells (IL6,
IL8, STAT4, STAT6, PPP3C, NFKBIA, IRF5, and CD69), as
well as genes involved in regulating apoptosis (BCL2A1,
CASP3, CASP9, CASP10, and DAP). Many of these same
genes were eventually up-regulated in polyA mRNA later
in the time course and their increase in expression after
one hour was independently validated by single endpoint PCR validation using GS320 technology (Fig. 3B).
A particularly interesting example of the dichotomy
between transcription and changes in polyA mRNA levels
was seen in the production of the mRNAs encoding
NFKB1 (NF-kappa B), a key mediator of the transcriptional control of genes involved in the immune response

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/75

and acute phase reactions, and its inhibitor, NFKBIA (NFkappa B inhibitor A). Both NFKB1 and NFKBIA have previously been shown by microarray analysis to be significantly induced in polyA mRNA between 3–4 hrs
following phorbol or lectin activation of either Jurkat or
human peripheral blood lymphocytes [7,8,11,17]. As
demonstrated here (Fig. 3C), the production of NFKB1
mRNA clearly increases between 30 minutes and one hour
at the transcriptional level without a detectable corresponding increase in polyA mRNA during that time (subsequent PCR analysis did show some increase at the
steady-state level between 0 and 60 minutes for the
NFKB1 gene but this increase failed to meet the significance thresholds set for the microarray analysis). NFKBIA,
on the other hand, is rapidly induced transcriptionally to
a maximum level by 30 minutes, returning essentially to
baseline within one hour. Meanwhile, NFKBIA steadystate levels can be seen to gradually rise across the first
hour of the time course. Analysis of the dynamics of gene
expression for NFKB1 and its inhibitor as deduced from
conventional microarrays might suggest that by one hour
NFKB1 production had not yet begun (contradicted by
the NRO data here), and also that the mRNA for the inhibitor of NKFKB1 is steadily increasing (when, in fact, it is
clear from NRO data that virtually all increases in the production of NFKBIA have concluded by one hour). These
data provide a clear example of how information from
nuclear run-on microarrays can enhance studies of gene
activation and feedback mechanisms.
Consistency at each time point for genes regulated by activation-induced changes in mRNA stability can be seen in
a graph of the Z ratio differences (Methods) between NRO
and polyA mRNA calculated for all genes at all time points
(Fig. 4A). These putative stability-regulated genes
exhibited a very high degree of consistency at all the time
points measured. This replicability is further illustrated in
the heat map of clustered gene expression in Figure 4B in
which the data for each gene has been independently normalized to its baseline (0 time) level. Large numbers of
genes as measured in the polyA mRNA are consistently
and strongly regulated following activation. Some of these
changes are mirrored by changes in gene transcription
(NRO) but most are not.
In order to compare changes in gene expression patterns
at the transcriptional and polyA mRNA levels in a systematic fashion, a simple barcode of 1, -1, or 0 was applied to
all significant changes in gene expression indicating up,
down, or no change, respectively. In addition, a value of 1, 0, or 1 (low, moderate, or high) was assigned to each
gene according to its relative intensity at baseline (0 time).
An analysis of the distribution of these gene expression
patterns (Fig. 5) revealed that both at the transcriptional
and the steady-state levels two thirds of all genes were

Frequency distribution of gene expression patterns generated from polyA mRNA or NRO RNA. The top 20 patterns for each
method is shown. Significant changes in gene expression were assigned a 1, -1, or 0 for up, down, or no change, respectively. In
addition, a value of -1, 0, or 1 (low, moderate, or high) was assigned to each gene according to its relative intensity at baseline
(0 time). The absolute numbers of genes in each pattern are reported in the column labeled Top 20 and the percentage of
those genes relative to all significantly regulated genes can be found in the column labeled % Sig. Totals are as indicated at the
bottom of each column. Filled-in boxes denote patterns equally shared in the top 20 between both methods

restricted to just one of 20 patterns (out of a possible
number of 729) and that half of these patterns were
shared between the two groups. An interesting distinction
between the two groups was that whereas up-regulation
from a moderately high level of baseline expression was
highly favored for new gene synthesis, down-regulation
from a moderately high level of baseline expression was
very highly favored during polyA mRNA regulation (Fig.
6). In fact, down-regulation, as a consistent trend, was
much less common among transcriptional-regulated than
steady-state-regulated genes, with implications (see
below) as to the roles these modes of regulation play in
concert for the control of gene expression.

In order to confirm that stability regulation was in fact a
reasonable explanation for the observation that the
expression levels of large numbers of genes were changing
at the whole cell but not the transcriptional level, a series
of experiments were carried out in which activation of Jurkat cells was carried out in the presence or absence of the
transcription inhibitor Actinomycin D. Analysis of polyA
mRNA demonstrated the strong inhibition of mRNA levels for genes previously shown to be transcriptionally upregulated (Fig. 7A). In contrast, large numbers of genes
which were significantly regulated in polyA mRNA but
not in NRO RNA were not affected by Actinomycin D
treatment (Fig. 7B &7C). Among these unaffected genes

Figure 7 of stability-regulated changes in gene expression in the presence of Actinomycin D
Persistence
Persistence of stability-regulated changes in gene expression in the presence of Actinomycin D. A. Effect of Actinomycin D on
the (P+I)-induced changes in the expression patterns of gene deemed to be transcriptionally regulated. Z ratio comparisons are
made to the baseline or unactivated state. B. Lack of an effect of Actinomycin D on the (P+I)-induced changes in the expression patterns of genes deemed to be stability regulated. The absolute differences (Z diff) between the activated and un-activated state for both polyA mRNA and NRO RNA for a subset of these genes is shown. C. Comparison of the Z ratios for all
significantly regulated genes in the presence or absence of Actinomycin D showing no corresponding regulation in NRO RNA.
Data is sorted by polyA mRNA (without ActD) values and a significance threshold of Z ratios > ± 1.5 was used for these
calculations.

there was a bias towards presumptively de-stablized genes
(Fig. 7C) consistent with the earlier conclusion (Fig. 6B)
that down-regulation is the predominant motif in overall
polyA mRNA levels.
Although an examination of the functional classifications
of stability regulated versus transcriptionally regulated
genes yielded no obvious trends, some biological pathways appear to be differentially, and sometimes, exhaustively regulated by each type of expression event. One
example of this can be seen in the apoptotic pathways,
which are comprehensively regulated during the Jurkat

activation scenario [16,18,19]. As can be seen from the
pathway schematic illustrated in Figure 8, some major
effectors of apoptosis such as CASP 3, 4, 8, 9, &10 (up-regulated) and BCL2 (down-regulated), are controlled by
new gene synthesis while other factors such as CASP 1, 6,
&7 (up-regulated) and BCL2L2 (down-regulated) appear
to be regulated by stability processes alone. Regardless of
the cellular rationale for regulating at the level of new
gene synthesis or mRNA stability, it is clear from these
data that there is a strong internal coherence: genes regulated by one mechanism do not crossover to the other
within the time frame investigated.

Apoptosis

Figure 8
and mRNA stability mechanisms
Regulation of apoptotic pathways during T cell activation involves changes in gene expression by both mRNA transcriptional
Regulation of apoptotic pathways during T cell activation involves changes in gene expression by both mRNA transcriptional
and mRNA stability mechanisms. Genes colored in red and blue were up- or down-regulated in polyA mRNA only. Genes
colored in yellow and purple were up- or down-regulated in NRO RNA. Pathway is from a Kegg map modified in Genmapp2.0
[27].

Common patterns of transcription factor binding sites in
the upstream promoter regions of groups of genes whose
transcription was significantly up-regulated were detected.
An enrichment of transcription factor-binding sites for
both NFAT and NFκB was found in the promoter regions
of genes most significantly up-regulated at 1 hour as
shown in Figure 9. The frequency with which both NFATand NFκB-binding sites were found in the promoters of
this group of genes was significantly greater than that seen
for other genes in the array [e.g., genes down-regulated at
this time point or genes selected at random [supplemental
data]. The discovery that NFAT- and NFκB-binding sites
were enriched in the promoters of these genes was not
unexpected, since these transcription factors, along with
AP-1 components Fos and Jun, constitute the major transcription factors involved in the early stages of T-cell activation. Indeed, the frequency of genes significantly upregulated in NRO RNA and enriched for AP-1 binding
sites peaks during the time course (supplemental data).
Many of the genes that are transcriptionally upregulated at
1 hour, such as CD69, are elevated throughout the time

examined, although a few genes including PTEN, DUSP5,
and NFκB1 itself, show elevated transcription only after
60 minutes. The simultaneous increase of NFκB1 gene
transcription (between 30 minutes and 1 hour) combined
with a noticeable increase in the transcription of genes
containing NFκB-binding sites (at one hour) demonstrates the synchronous relationship between the appearance of this transcription factor and its downstream
targets at the indicated time points.

Discussion
The absence of significant regulation at the transcriptional
level during a time in which gene expression is strongly
perturbed at the polyA mRNA level during T cell activation reveals that many genes are being regulated through
changes in stability. The lack of detectable transcriptional
regulation of large numbers of steady-state mRNA gene
changes is particularly striking insofar as the NRO measurements are likely to be even more sensitive to changes
in gene expression than polyA mRNA measurements since
they are a direct measure of newly synthesized mRNA.

This finding is consistent with the work of Raghavan et. al.
[12,20] who also noted the presence of numerous
transcripts exhibiting stimulus-dependent changes in
mRNA decay in human T lymphocytes treated for 3 hours
with anti-CD3 and/or anti-CD28 antibodies. These experiments were carried out by arresting transcription with
Actinomycin D (in the presence or absence of activation),
and mRNA turnover rates were globally measured by
applying polyA mRNA to microarrays. Similarly, in this
current work, patterns of Actinomycin D resistant changes
in gene expression among groups of genes significantly
regulated only at the polyA mRNA level supports the
observation that large numbers of genes are regulated primarily by stability during T cell activation.
The smaller, but still substantial, group of genes which
displayed significant transcriptional regulation without
any corresponding changes in polyA mRNA, may either
be a reflection of the enhanced sensitivity of transcriptional detection or, perhaps, result from a persistent lag
between changes in transcriptional output and their
reflection in steady-state mRNA levels. Such a lag might
arise from differences in scale of the absolute size of
mRNA pools between newly transcribed and polyA
mRNA. In this scenario, changes in the amounts of mRNA
that are readily detectable by nuclear run-on may be too
small to have an immediate detectable impact on the
steady-state RNA pools, possibly for long periods of time.
Another possibility is that the nascent mRNAs of some of
these genes are so rapidly degraded that they never significantly impact on polyA mRNA levels at all.
As previously noted (Fig. 6), up-regulation of gene expression was a dominant trend for transcriptionally regulated
genes while down-regulation was dramatically favored for
genes regulated at the polyA mRNA level. From the standpoint of an overall cellular economy of gene expression,
effective control at the level of transcription can be
achieved primarily by turning on new gene transcription,
while at the whole-cell level, rapid and effective regulation
can be achieved by massive shifts in the stability of existing mRNA pools. In fact, the single most dramatic regulatory event experimentally observed was the rapid
clearance of large pools of steady-state mRNA, presumably as result of a sudden and demanding change in cellular conditions.
Questions remain as to the extent that this type of regulation may occur under differing biological scenarios. Global regulation of mRNA stability has thus far been
systematically studied under conditions of stress and
cellular activation. It remains to be determined whether or
not changes in mRNA stability are responsible for altering
gene expression programs in response to other biological
conditions. The existence of these regulatory paradigms

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/75

may require a reevaluation of the common model of the
control of gene expression which essentially invokes the
turning on and off of gene transcription in order to
explain changes in polyA mRNA levels.

Conclusion
Although stability regulation might reasonably be considered as a cellular measure to bridge the gap between the
very rapid events of signal transduction and the longer
term induction of cellular programs involving the coordinated transcription of batteries of new gene synthesis, the
current data actually suggests otherwise. One of the goals
in this work was to examine changes in gene expression
due to altered transcription and those due to altered turnover across a time course allowing sufficient time for the
resolution of time disparities between new mRNA synthesis and their appearance as measurable cellular pools. Sufficient time for effective transcription and even translation
was clearly demonstrated by the example of NFKB1
mRNA induction followed by the transcription of its
downstream targets. Patterns of stability regulated genes
were, in this model system, non-random and surprisingly
persistent throughout the entire time course suggesting
that stability regulation was a major component in the
control of gene expression for significant periods of time.
The presence of highly active and global regulation of
polyA mRNA levels by stability-altering mechanisms suggests a new significant level of regulation in the control of
gene expression which spans wide phylogenetic distances
from yeast [15] to humans, emphasizes a possible parsimonious role for new gene synthesis in response to changing cellular environments, and may help to explain some
of the difficulties encountered in attempts to comprehensively correlate clustered changes in polyA mRNA with
common promoter regulatory elements.

Methods
Cell culture and treatment
The human Jurkat E6-1 T cell line was cultured in RPMI1640 medium (GIBCO-BRL, Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with 10% FCS (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and antibiotics, and incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2. Cells were
stimulated with 40 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and 1 µM ionomycin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO)
(P+I). Actinomycin D (A.G. Scientific, San Diego, CA) was
added at 10 ug/ml 30 minutes prior to activation with
PMA + I.
Preparation and purification of RNA
Isolation of nuclei and preparation of nuclear run-on
(NRO) RNA were as described [6,21] with some modifications. Briefly, ~108 cells per sample were pelleted, washed
with PBS, resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mM
Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 20 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.25% [v/
v] NP-40), and incubated on ice for 5 min. Nuclei were

Page 13 of 16

BMC Genomics 2005, 6:75

spun down, resuspended in storage buffer (50 mM TrisHCl [pH 8.3], 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA-NaOH [pH
8.0], 40% [v/v] glycerol) and stored at -80°C until use.
Thawed nuclei (200-µl aliquots) were mixed with 200 µl
of reaction buffer (5 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 0.15 mM KCl,
2.5 mM MgCl2, 2.5 mM DTT, 0.5 mM of each ATP, UTP,
GTP) plus 500 µCi of [α-33P]UTP (3,000 Ci/mmol, 10
mCi/ml; ICN), and incubated for 30 min at 30°C with
shaking. Samples were then incubated with DNase I
(100U, RNase-free; Roche Diagnostics) for 20 min at
37°C, and with proteinase K (1 µg/µl) for 1 h at 37°C.
Finally, nascent RNA was purified by Sephadex G-50 column filtration. For the preparation of polyA mRNA cellular RNA, resting or stimulated Jurkat cells were lysed in
STAT60™ (TEL-TEST, INC., Friendswood, TX) as described
[6]. RNA concentration and quality were assessed spectrophotometrically and by agarose gel electrophoresis. NRO
RNA was stored at -80°C until use.
PolyA mRNA samples were radiolabeled and hybridized
as previously described [22]. In brief, 5 µg of total mRNA
for each sample was annealed, in 16 µl H2O, with 1 µg of
24-mer poly(dT) primer (Research Genetics, Alabama),
by heating at 65°C for 10 min and cooling on ice for 2
min. The RT reaction was performed by adding 8 µl of 5X
first strand RT buffer (Life Technologies, Rockville, MD),
4 µl of 20 mM dNTPs minus dCTP) (Pharmacia,
Piscataway, NJ), 4 µl of 0.1 M DTT, 40 U of RNAseOUT
(Life Technologies), 6 µl of 3000 Ci/mmol α-33P dCTP
(ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA) to the RNA/primer
mixture to a final volume of 40 µl. Two µl (400 U) of
Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies) was
then added, and the sample was incubated for 60 min at
42°C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of five µl
of 0.5 M EDTA. The samples were incubated at 65°C for
30 min after addition of 10 µl of 0.1 M NaOH in order to
hydrolyze and remove RNA. The samples were pH neutralized by the addition of 25 µl of 0.5 M Tris, pH 8.0, and
purified using Bio-Rad 6 purification columns (Hercules,
CA). An aliquout of each labled sample was quantitated
by liquid scintillation counting using a Beckman LS 6500.
The entire remaining sample was stored at -20°C until
use.
Array construction and hybridization
Microarray construction and hybridization were previously described [23]. Briefly, NIA Human Focused Arrays
consisting of a set of 4600 spotted cDNAs, arrayed in
duplicate, representing a set of 2742 non-redundant genes
(enriched in genes involved in immune function and signal transduction), were printed on Nytran + Supercharge
nylon membranes (Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH), and
hybridized with [α-33P]dCTP-labeled cDNA or [α33P]UTP RNA probes overnight at 50°C as previously
described [22], protocols available at http://

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/75

www.grc.nia.nih.gov/branches/rrb/dna/dna.htm. Hybridized arrays were rinsed in 2 X SSC and 0.1% SDS twice at
55°C followed by washes in 2 X SSC and 0.1% SDS at
55°C. Microarrays were exposed for 1–3 d and scanned
using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) at a 50-µm pixel resolution. ArrayPro software
(MediaCybernetics, Silver Spring, MD) was used to convert the hybridization signals into raw intensity values;
data generated were transferred into Microsoft Excel for
further analysis.
PCR analysis
Single endpoint PCR was carried out on polyA mRNA for
gene detection and relative quantitative comparison
between baseline (0 time) and I hour activation (with
PMA +I). In brief, GS320 libraries for both control and
activated polyA mRNA were prepared as described [24],
normalized using a panel of ribosomal protein genes, and
specific genes were amplified in duplicate using predefined GS320 primers.
Array data analysis
RNA samples (typically n = 3 to n = 5) were prepared from
multiple experiments, each of which consisted of a consecutive series of time points. Equal amounts of total RNA
(5 µg) or NRO RNA (108 cell-equivalents) were used in
each hybridization. Raw intensity data for each experiment was transformed to log10, then used for the calculation of Z scores as described [22] [see Additional file 1].
Significant changes in gene expression were calculated in
the form of Z ratios and/or Z test values ([25]), using Z
score values in all calculations. Z ratios constitute a measure of the change in gene expression of a given gene from
its baseline value (in this case – time 0), expressed in units
of standard deviation from the average change of all genes
for that comparison. Z ratios are a direct measure of the
likelihood that an observed change is an outlier in an otherwise normal distribution and, as such, are independent
from underlying intensity values. Since the contents of the
population of nuclear run-on and polyA mRNA are different in both complexity and number, care was taken not to
compare Z score normalized intensities directly. Comparisons between Z ratios, however, test for equivalence of
significant changes between the transcriptional and
steady-state changes in gene expression each relative to its
own population. All gene expression changes were
assessed through comparison with untreated cells (time
0). A Z ratio value of ± 1.50 and/or a Z test value p <
0.0001 were the significance thresholds used in this study.

Hierarchical clustering was performed using the Cluster
and TreeView software programs, developed at Stanford
University [26]. The clustering algorithm was set to complete linkage clustering using the uncentered Pearson
correlation.
