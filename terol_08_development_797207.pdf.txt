Abstract
Background: Citrus species constitute one of the major tree fruit crops of the subtropical regions
with great economic importance. However, their peculiar reproductive characteristics, low genetic
diversity and the long-term nature of tree breeding mostly impair citrus variety improvement. In
woody plants, genomic science holds promise of improvements and in the Citrus genera the
development of genomic tools may be crucial for further crop improvements. In this work we
report the characterization of three BAC libraries from Clementine (Citrus clementina), one of the
most relevant citrus fresh fruit market cultivars, and the analyses of 46.000 BAC end sequences.
Clementine is a diploid plant with an estimated haploid genome size of 367 Mb and 2n = 18
chromosomes, which makes feasible the use of genomics tools to boost genetic improvement.
Results: Three genomic BAC libraries of Citrus clementina were constructed through EcoRI, MboI
and HindIII digestions and 56,000 clones, representing an estimated genomic coverage of 19.5
haploid genome-equivalents, were picked. BAC end sequencing (BES) of 28,000 clones produced
28.1 Mb of genomic sequence that allowed the identification of the repetitive fraction (12.5% of the
genome) and estimation of gene content (31,000 genes) of this species. BES analyses identified
3,800 SSRs and 6,617 putative SNPs. Comparative genomic studies showed that citrus gene
homology and microsyntheny with Populus trichocarpa was rather higher than with Arabidopsis
thaliana, a species phylogenetically closer to citrus.
Conclusion: In this work, we report the characterization of three BAC libraries from C.
clementina, and a new set of genomic resources that may be useful for isolation of genes underlying
economically important traits, physical mapping and eventually crop improvement in Citrus species.
In addition, BAC end sequencing has provided a first insight on the basic structure and organization
of the citrus genome and has yielded valuable molecular markers for genetic mapping and cloning
of genes of agricultural interest. Paired end sequences also may be very helpful for whole-genome
sequencing programs.

Background
Citrus, one of the major fruit tree crops is widely cultivated throughout the globe and therefore has a tremendous economical, social and cultural impact in our
society. Citrus improvement through traditional techniques, however, is highly impaired due to the unusual
combination of biological characteristics of Citrus species,
their low genetic diversity and the long-term nature of tree
breeding. Citrus are diploid plants with an estimated haploid genome size of about 367 Mb and 2n = 18 chromosomes, which may facilitate the use of genomics tools for
crop improvement. Expressed sequence tag (EST) analyses
and molecular marker studies strongly suggest that the
main commercial citrus cultivars (oranges, lemons and
grapefruits) are mostly interspecific hybrids and therefore
are heterozygous "species" [1]. In addition, most of the
cultivars in these groups, including Clementine varieties,
may represent accumulated somatic mutations identified
over centuries [2].
The development of citrus genomic resources is in its
infancy although in recent years major efforts and goals
mostly on functional genomics have certainly been undertaken [3]. Critical functional and expression analyses
through microarrays with several platforms have also
been published and analyses of ESTs in public databases
have been initiated [4,5]. For instance, 401,692 citrus
ESTs have been deposited at GenBank and are currently
available. This collection constitutes a valuable source for
the direct access to the genes of interest and for the development of molecular markers for map-based cloning purposes or marker-assisted selection programs [6-9].
Moreover, genetic linkage maps have been produced with
increasing value and resolution, following the evolution
of new marker systems [10,11]. Genetic transformation in
citrus is also available [12] and strategies based on
genome-wide mutagenesis are being explored. Other
innovative resources such as viral-induced gene silencing
(VIGS) are being developed and work in citrus proteomics
is in progress [13,14]. Thus, current advances in citrus
research include the rapid development of functional
genomics and molecular biology resources [15] although,
on the other hand, basic information on the organization
and structure of citrus genome is lacking. The main challenge for a comprehensive and meaningful description of
genomes is the integration of the DNA marker-based
genetic maps with physical maps, and eventually with
DNA sequence of the whole genome, the ultimate physical map. For the generation of high-resolution physical
maps, the construction of BAC libraries containing clones
with large DNA fragments appears to be indispensable.
BAC end sequencing is indeed an important component
of physical map development and can be considered a
form of low coverage sequencing [16]. Paired end
sequences of BACs form an important part of scaffolding

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/423

whole-genome shotgun programs [17] as well as in BAC
based genome projects [18,19]. In addition, BAC clone
collections and BAC-based contig maps are powerful tools
having multiple applications in genomics including positional cloning. The BAC end sequence provides a random
survey of the information contents (genes, transposons,
repeats) of unsequenced genomes [20-22], and yields
molecular markers useful for genetic mapping [23-25],
and cloning of genes of agricultural interest [26-28]. Furthermore, in many agriculturally important species BAC
clones and physical maps are being rapidly developed
since they are essential components in linking phenotypic
traits to the responsible genetic variation, to integrate the
genetic data, for the comparative analysis of genomes, and
to speed up marker-assisted selection (MAS) for breeding.
Thus, BAC libraries have become central for physical mapping, genome analysis, clone based sequencing and
sequencing of complex genomes, for both model [18,19]
and main crop plants [29-32].
In citrus, two BAC libraries from Poncirus trifoliata [11]
and a hybrid of Citrus × Poncirus [10] have been described
in detail. These libraries were constructed as part of a mapbased cloning strategy of genes conferring resistance to citrus tristeza virus that causes significant economic damage
and losses to citrus worldwide. Poncirus is a non domesticated genus related to citrus species that produces inedible
fruit. However, other efforts to generate BAC citrus
resources, for instance in Satsuma or sweet orange have
also been accomplished [3].
In this work, we report the characterization of three
genomic BAC libraries from Clementine (Citrus clementina) mandarin, a cultivar of great [3]economic importance that has been a main target of recent studies [15].
The development of these new genomic tools also complements the functional genomics platform generated for
this species including an extensive EST collection and a 20
k cDNA chip [4,5], expanding further possibilities for isolation of genes of agronomical interest [33,34]. This study
provides the most comprehensive, large insert clone
resource of any Citrus species and reports the analysis of
46,339 BAC end sequences offering a first detailed insight
into the sequence composition of the Clementine
genome. The analyses focused on protein coding regions,
repeat element composition, microsatellite and single
nucleotide polymorphism contents. Additionally, data on
gene homology based comparative genomics with poplar
and Arabidopsis are also presented. The annotated BACend sequences may well serve as useful resources for physical mapping, positional cloning, genetic marker development and genome sequencing of C. clementina.

Results and discussion
BAC library characterization
Three genomic BAC libraries (CCL1, CCER1 and CCH3)
were constructed as described in Material and Methods,
with DNA from Citrus clementina (var. Clemenules),
pEBAC1 as the cloning vector and three different restriction enzymes (Table 1). The CCL1 library composed of
19,200 clones was generated with MboI partial digestions.
EcoRI and HindIII were used for the construction of
CCER1 and CCH3, respectively, and 18,432 clones were
picked from each one. The three libraries contained
56,064 BAC clones that were arrayed in 146 384-well
microtiter plates. It has been reported that the use of three
different restriction enzymes resulted in a more accurate
coverage of the genomes, since the different GC contents
of their recognition sites increases the representation of a
higher number of genomic regions [35]. A single library
constructed with one restriction enzyme usually cannot
provide a full coverage of the genome, as the restriction
sites are not uniformly distributed along the genome, and
therefore genomic regions having too many or too few
restriction sites are not equally represented [36]. Generally, two or more complementary large insert libraries,
constructed with different restriction enzymes, have been
successfully used for physical mapping of several plant
genomes including those of Arabidopsis[37], japonica
rice [38], or soybean [30].

In order to evaluate the average BAC insert size, 362 BAC
clones (about 120 clones from each library) were randomly chosen and the corresponding DNA was extracted,
digested with the rare cutter NotI enzyme and analyzed by
PFGE. All fragments generated by NotI digestion contained the 8.7 kb vector band and various insert fragments
(Figure 1). The estimated insert sizes ranged from 10 to
330 kb, with an average of 124 kb for CCL1, 132 kb for
CCH3 and 127 kb for CCER1. Since the haploid genome
size of C. clementina is in the order of 367 Mb, the libraries
coverage is predicted to be 19.5 haploid genome equivalents while the probability of finding any specific
sequence is greater than 99.999%. It has been estimated
that the number of clones representing 10× haploid

including physical mapping [39].
BAC end sequencing
A total of 28,032 BAC clones from the three genomic
libraries were selected for end sequencing as described in
material and methods and out of this number, 24,221
clones (86% success rate) rendered 46,339 BAC end
sequences (BESs). The three libraries contributed approximately with similar number of reads. The average read
length was 652.8 bp and the genomic raw sequence produced was 28.6 Mb, which corresponds to almost 8% of
the Clementine genome. Table 2 shows a summary of the
BAC end sequencing features. The 46,339 BESs were
deposited at GenBank with accession numbers from
ET068227 to ET114565.
Sequence Annotation
Chloroplast and mitochondrion DNA analysis
In order to identify extranuclear sequences, BES were first
compared against the Citrus sinensis chloroplastic [40] and
the Arabidopsis thaliana [41] mitochondrial genome
sequences with an stringent threshold of 1e-15. The comparison indicated that 736 (1.68%) and 46 (0.1%)
sequences produced significant matches with the chloroplastic and mitochondrial genomes, respectively. Chloroplastic BESs were assembled and the consensus sequences
obtained spanned 101,470 bp, approximately 70% of the
chloroplast genome. Chloroplastic and mitochondrial
DNA summed up to 480 kb, and therefore, the total
genomic DNA obtained was 28,1 Mb. Considering the
average size of the BAC clones, the coverage provided by

Repetitive DNA Analysis
The repetitive DNA fraction present in Clementine BESs
revealed with RepeatMasker, included 9,618 interspersed
repeats which extended over 2.55 Mb, 8.95% of the total
raw sequence (Table 3). BLASTX search performed to
identify coding regions (see next section), showed that
2,173 additional sequences not detected by RepeatMasker
also presented high significant similarity to transposable
elements (TEs) and, therefore, are also part of the repetitive DNA fraction of the genome. Thus, the number of
BESs with interspersed repeats rose to 11,791, approxi-

mately a 25% of the total reads, a percentage between
those found for Carica papaya (16%) [20] or Musa acuminata (36%) [21]. No significant differences between the 3
BAC libraries were found when the number of BESs carrying repetitive elements was compared (see Additional File
1). The sequence length occupied by transposon elements
(TEs) including the additional reads identified through
homology search was in this way increased to 3.58 Mb, a
fraction corresponding to 12.6% of the total BAC end
sequences. This fraction was rather similar to the ratio
reported for Brassica rapa (13.8%) in an estimation also
based on partial sequencing [22]. Comparisons with the
percentages found in fully sequenced genomes showed
that the relative occurrence of TEs in Clementine was also

similar to the fractions found in Arabidopsis (10%) [18]
and black cottonwood (12.6%) [17] and lower than in
rice (35%) [19] and grapevine (38.8%) [42]. Although the
proportion of the different TEs largely varied, in all these
species, as well as in C. clementina, class I elements
(including LINE, Gypsy-like and Copia-like elements)
were predominant over class II (including CACTA, MULE
and hAT elements). In comparison with the above
sequenced plants, the occurrence of Mutator-like, LINEs,
Cacta, and Gypsy elements, represented as the percentage
of occupied sequence, was in general lower in the genome
of C. clementina. In contrast, copia-like elements were relatively more abundant in Clementine than in Arabidopsis,
rice and poplar (Figure 2). The abundance of these elements in citrus has previously been estimated to be relatively high (13%) [43], while the data obtained through
partial sequencing in this study suggested a lower preponderance (3.9%; Table III). Copia and gypsy like elements,
however, are transcriptionally active in Clementine
[43,44] and therefore, could be an important source of
genetic variability in this species.
In order to identify low complexity repeats, all BESs were
searched against themselves with BLASTN and then classified based on the number of significant hits produced
(Figure 3). After filtration, 17,585 BES producing at least
one hit different from themselves were clustered in this
way. The results showed that while a high proportion of
BESs (82%) displayed a low number of hits, 3,221 reads
produced more that 10 hits, suggesting that these BESs
may carry non-coding repetitive sequences, i.e. they may
be interspersed repeats of lower complexity. The amount
of sequence occupied by these repeats was estimated to be

1.12 Mb, 3.94% of the analyzed sequence. This proportion appears to be moderate in comparison with the
23.5% figure reported for poplar [17].
Analysis of coding regions
After filtration of mitochondrial, chloroplastic and repetitive sequences, the remaining 30,787 BES were analyzed
for coding region identification via homology search. Parallel searches with BLASTX and BLASTN were performed
against the non-redundant database (e value cut off of 1e4) and a database of Citrus ESTs from GenBank (e value
cut off of 1e-15), respectively. The BLASTX search identified 14,030 BES (36% of the total BESs) with significant
protein hits, while the BLASTN search revealed a similar
number of reads, i.e. 14,023 reads that rendered significant homology with 40,536 citrus ESTs. Overall, 20,185
BESs produced BLASTX and/or BLASN hits, and the 3 BAC
libraries rendered a similar number of clones carrying
potential coding regions (see Additional File 1). The total
number of BAC clones that produced protein and/or EST
hits was 15.658, while 4,527 of them provided hits in
both 5' and 3' ends, an observation that suggested high
gene contents in these BAC clones and indeed their possible location at the euchromatin. It was also found that
7,868 BES produced hits for both proteins and ESTs,
strongly indicating that they contained active transcription units.

Assuming that each significant BLAST hit corresponds to a
different transcription unit, the total number of hypothetical genes described in the BAC ends was 20,185. Thus,
considering the amount of analyzed sequence (28.1 Mb),

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:423

the estimated genome size (367 Mb), and the number of
genomic equivalents analyzed (8.4), the gene contents of
the genome of Citrus clementina was assessed as 31,000.
This gene number is comparable to the estimate reported
for three species of similar genome size that have been
sequenced to completion to date: rice (Oryza sativa), with
a genome size of 430 Mb and 41,042 genes identified
[45], Black cottonwood with 55,000 genes in 485 Mb
[17], and grapevine (Vitis vinifera), with 30,434 genes in
487 Mb [42]. Other estimates based on BES analysis
obtained for plant species were also analogous. For
instance, in papaya, the estimated gene contents was
35,526 with a 372 Mb genome size [20], and in Chinese
cabbage, with a genome of 529 Mb, 43,000 genes were
calculated [22].
Furthermore, total GC content in BESs estimated with
EMBOSS was 39% while in coding and non-coding
sequences, was 41% and 37%, respectively (Figure 4). No
significant differences were found when the GC content
was compared between the 3 BAC libraries constructed
(see Additional File 1). The GC contents reported in other
woody plants such as Scots Pine (Pinus sylvestris; 39.5%)
[46] or yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera; 41%) [28] as
well as in coding sequences from Solanaceae species i.e.
Nicotiana tabacum (40.4%), Solanum tuberosum (39.0%),
and Solanum esculentum (39.8%), or the Fabaceae Pisum
sativum (39.2%) were also on the same range. The percentage of GC in Glycine max (46.5%) and A. thaliana (45.4%)
was significantly higher [47].
Lastly, Blast2GO [48] was used to analyze the different
functions associated with the putative coding regions, and
GO terms were assigned to 10,598 sequences. Additional
file 2 shows the results obtained for the gene ontology cat-

egories Molecular Function and Process. This classification may be useful to identify and locate genes of
agronomic interest, such as those related to sugar and cellulose synthesis [GenBank:ET090832, GenBank:ET07067

metabolism [GenBank:ET068865, GenBank:ET091143,
GenBank:ET084632], for instance.
SSR Analysis
BAC end sequences have proved to be excellent sources to
identify simple sequence repeats (SSRs or microsatellites)
in many plant species such as cotton or soybean
[23,25,49]. In this work, Sputnik [50] was used to identify
a total of 3,814 SSRs longer than 15 bp in the BESs that
did not carry repetitive sequences. The occurrence of SSRs
in the Clementine genome had a frequency of 0.20 SSR
per kb, a value almost identical to that reported in a study
based on citrus ESTs (0.19 SSR per kb) [51] and in B. rapa
(0.18 SSR per kb) [22]. This frequency, however, was
lower than the ratios found in grapevine (0.48 SSR per kb)
[42], papaya (0.43 SSRs longer than 12 bp per kb) [20],
and A. thaliana (0.33 SSR per kb).

In the Clementine SSR set, there were 758 class I (more
than 10 repeats) and 3,056 class II (less than 10 repeats)
SSRs, with di and trinucloetides accounting for almost
70% of the SSRs, while tetra and pentanucleotides were
less represented. In general, those motifs containing A/T
nucleotides were far more abundant than G/C rich
repeats, specially ATT/TAA and AT/TA tri- and dinucleotides (Figure 5). A similar distribution was found by
Jiang et al[8] and Chen et al. [51] in the analysis of 8,218

and 3,278 citrus SSRs derived from ESTs, respectively. In
the Clementine genome, microsatellites were more
numerous in non coding sequences (56% of the SSRs)
than in putative coding regions (44%), as previously
reported in papaya [20], Chinese cabbage [22], and Arabidopsis[18].
Microsatellites are co-dominant, highly polymorphic, and
simple to use markers that have been successfully used in
studies of genetic diversity [7] and genetic mapping in citrus [8,52] and in many other plants [25,53-55]. The additional markers reported here will certainly contribute to
improve the coverage of the Citrus genome for many purposes, including the development of accurate linkage and
genetic maps.
Contig Assembly and SNP analysis
Assembly of BESs that did not contain repetitive
sequences was performed with CAP3 [56], and a total of
6,461 contigs including 19,057 reads and covering 6.14
Mb of sequence were produced. It has been suggested that
C. clementina is an offspring of a C. sinensis × C. reticulata
cross and therefore has a heterozygous genome [1]. In
order to identify possible polymorphisms affecting the
assembly of the readings and the construction of the physical map of this species, a BLASTN search of all the contigs
and singlets was performed against themselves. One hundred thirty sequence pairs that presented a single reciprocal BLASTN hit and the same protein hit from the previous
BLASTX search (identical accession number) were selected
for further analysis. A total of 81 pairs displayed sequence
identities higher than 90% and were considered as originated from the same genomic region. These sequences
were not assembled in the same contig due to the presence
of polymorphisms, similarly to what was reported in the
sequencing of the highly heterozygous grapevine variety,
Pinot Noir [57].

The contigs generated in the assembly were analyzed in
order to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
in the diploid genome of C. Clementina. SNPs are the most
abundant and powerful polymorphic markers, since they
provide gene-based markers that can be used in the creation of dense genetic linkage maps [58] and, more important, in the identification of genes associated with specific
trait loci. BAC end sequences of heterozygous genotypes
have also been successfully utilized in SNP discovery and
construction of linkage maps [59-61]. PolyBayes [62], a
software designed to use genomic sequence as a template
and base quality values to discern true allelic variations
from sequencing errors, was used to reveal SNP polymorphisms. The number of putative SNPs identified in the
Clementine sequences that showed P ≥ 0.9 and SNP depth
lower than 10 was 6,617, corresponding to 1.08 SNPs per
kb. PolyBayes has been successfully utilized in automated

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/423

high throughput identification of SNPs from EST collections, and it has been shown that when using P ≥ 0.95,
85% of the predicted SNPs are generally validated experimentally [63].
In order to test the accuracy of the SNP prediction carried
out, a total of 30 polymorphisms were randomly chosen
for experimental validation. Primers were designed on the
consensus sequence of the contigs, in order to amplify the
region containing the SNP. Out of 30 genomic regions, 3
produced two or more bands in the PCR amplification or
yielded sequence reads with a mixture of templates. This
observation constitutes a first indication of the level of
heterozygosity of the Clementine genome. Furthermore,
the sequence analysis of the remaining SNP candidates
showed that 24 out of the 27 hypothetical polymorphisms, an 88.9% success rate, were certainly validated
(see Additional File 3). Considering the reliability of the
prediction method, more than 5000 putative polymorphisms with P ≥ 0.95 were found in this work. Transitions
were the most abundant changes (3,546; 53.6%), followed by transversions (2,162; 32.7%) and indels (909;
13.7%) (Table 4). The transition fraction found in poplar
(70%) was substantially higher [17]. The predominant
transversion was A/T at a frequency that doubled that of
C/G changes (Table 4), an unexpected observation that
remains to be explained.
It should be noted that the SNP listing reported in this
work constitutes the first set of putative SNPs identified in

any Citrus species, and hence provides a completely new
resource for genome analysis in this genera. It is also
worth mentioning that 4,500 SNPs were located in or
close to putative coding regions, and therefore these 'functional SNPs' may provide an inestimable resource for the
identification of genes associated with specific trait loci in
addition to their utility as molecular markers for genetic
and comparative mapping, nucleotide diversity analysis
and association studies.
Two heterozygous genomes have been sequenced to completion, the Nisqually-1 poplar and the Pinot Noir grapevine strains. In both cases the frequency of
polymorphisms found within these heterozygous
genomes, was 2.6 [17] and 4 [57] SNPs per kb, respectively. These rates are in contrast with the frequency of
1.08 SNPs per kb found in Clementine. The reproductive
biology of the different species could explain these differences. Gametophytic self- and cross-incompatibility, and
apomixy would produce low variability within Citrus species [7], while outcrossing by means of insect and wind
pollination, which is the norm for poplar and vitis, would
result in highly heterozygous cultivars [17,57].
Comparative Genomics
The non-repetitive fraction of the BESs was also used in a
BLASTN search against the complete nucleotide sequence
of the genomes of A. thaliana, P. trichocarpa and O. sativa,
with 1e-14 as cut off value. The genomic sequences were
displayed with chromosomes as single searchable fasta
sequences. In order to map the BESs unambiguously on
the heterologous complete genomes, only those
sequences producing single significant hits were taken
into account. Table 5 shows that the Populus genome not
only yielded the largest number of significant hits (3-fold
more than Arabidopsis and almost 5-fold than rice), but
also spanned more than twice the length of the sequence
displaying similarity.

The 1567 BESs that produced significant hits with poplar
were mapped on the chromosomes of this species. The
representation drawn in Figure 6 showed that citrus
sequences were rather uniformly widespread on the 19
poplar chromosomes, an observation that can also be
deduced from data in Table 6 that in addition shows that

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/423

the average number of tags per chromosome was 83 while
the distance between tags was 213 kb. Considering that
both species have similar genome size, the uniform distribution of the Clementine tags on the poplar chromosomes may suggest that the citrus genome is conveniently
represented in the BAC clone set.
Following the approach of Lai et al. [20], we used forward
and reverse BES read pairs separated by the approximate
length of BAC clone inserts (~120 kb), to analyze the
microsynteny between C. clementina and Arabidopsis, rice
and poplar. To be considered as potentially collinear with
the target genome, the citrus mate pairs had to map in the
heterologous genome into a region comprised between 10
and 300 kb and be also oriented properly. The analyses of
the sequences identified 108 Clementine BAC end pairs
that met these criteria in poplar, while no one was found
in Arabidopsis or rice. Furthermore, the majority of these
BES pairs mapped on the Populus genome at a distance
similar to the insert size of the Clementine libraries, suggesting the microsynteny between citrus and poplar is
higher than between citrus and Arabidopsis. These results
are striking since C. clementina and A. thaliana belong to
Sapindales and Brassicales orders (eurosids II clade) that
probably split approximately 87 MYA, while P. trichocarpa
belongs to Malpighiales order, (eurosids I clade) that
diverged from eurosids II around 109 MYA [64]. Moreover, similar results were obtained by Lai et al [20] with
papaya, that also exhibited higher level of colinearity with
the poplar than with the Arabidopsis genome despite that
C. papaya is a basal member of the Brassicales. Although a
definitive explanation has not been provided yet, it is currently believed that the genome of A. thaliana has undergone a recent whole genome duplication, followed by
subsequent gene losses and extensive local gene duplications [18], which might be responsible of the lack of
colinearity with other eurosid II species. Comparative
genomics with the recently sequenced genome of the
grapevine, provides additional evidence that the genome
of Arabidopsis has been thoroughly rearranged as related
to an ancient angiosperm genome [42]. The fact that
papaya, Clementine, grapevine and poplar are long lived,
clonally propagated, woody plants, might apparently
cause a deceleration of their molecular clocks, resulting in

Conclusion
We report here the construction of three genomic BAC
libraries of Citrus clementina, with three restriction
enzymes (EcoRI, MboI and HindIII). The number of picked
BAC clones (56,000) and the average length of the inserts
provide coverage of 19.5 haploid genome equivalents,

ensuring a wide representation of the genome of this species. These libraries are adequate for the construction of
the physical map of C. clementina. The analysis of 28.1 Mb
of genomic sequence produced by BAC end sequencing
has provided a first insight of the genome organization of
C. clementina. The repetitive fraction of this species corresponding with transposable elements comprised 12.5%
of the genome, while the gene number was estimated to
be 31,000. This work also describes a set of 3,814 SSRs

and a collection of the first 6,617 putative SNPs described
in citrus that may be very useful for positional cloning,
genetic and comparative mapping, nucleotide diversity
analysis, and association studies. Finally, comparative
genomics through gene homology searches has shown
that, in spite of their taxonomic classification, microsynteny between Citrus and Populus is higher than with Arabidopsis that is a phylogenetically closer species.

Methods
Clementine genotype
Citrus clementina (Clementine mandarin, var. clemenules)
developing leaves were used for BAC library construction.
BAC library construction
BAC libraries were constructed from high molecular
weight (HMW) genomic DNA processed at Amplicon
Express, (Pullman, Washington) using the method
described in [65]. DNA digestion was performed with varying amounts of MboI, EcoRI, and HindIII to identify
appropriate partial digestion conditions. pECBAC1 and
contained two FRT and one oriV elements, thus resulting
in the pBAC(FRT-oriV) vector [66]. Ligations were transformed into DH10B Escherichia coli cells (Invitrogen) and
plated on LB agar with chloramphenicol (30 μg/ml), X-gal
(20 mg/ml) and IPTG (0.1 M). Clones were robotically
picked with a Genomic Solution G3 into 384 well plates
containing LB freezing media. Plates were incubated for
18 h, replicated and then frozen at -80°C. The replicated
copy was used for BAC end sequencing.
Insert size estimation
To estimate insert sizes, 10 μl aliquots of BAC miniprep
DNA were digested with 5 U of NotI enzyme for three h at
37°C. The digestion products were separated by pulsedfield Weld gel electrophoresis (CHEF-DRIII system, BioRad) in a 1% agarose gel in TBE buffer 0,5×. Insert sizes
were compared to those of the Lambda Ladder PFG
Marker (New England Biolabs). Electrophoresis was carried out for 18 h at 14°C with an initial switch time of 5
s, a Wnal switch time of 15 s, in a voltage gradient of 6 V/
cm.
BAC End Sequencing
BAC clones were inoculated into 96-deep well macroplates and grown for 20 hs at 37°C. Cells were harvested
by centrifugation and BACs were purified in 96-well plates
by a standard alkaline lysis protocol developed by Genoscope (Paris, France). BAC DNA was precipitated with isopropanol and washed with 70% ethanol. Sequencing was
carried out on ABI3730 equipment with "Dye Terminator" process using ABI kit version 3.1. in the Genoscope
facility.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/423

Bioinformatics
The software phred [67]was used for base calling, and
Crossmatch for vector masking. Repetitive DNA was identified with the RepeatMasker software [68], using the
viridiplantae section of the RepBase Update [69] as database. Assembly was performed with CAP3 [56], using read
quality and default parameters. Similarity searches were
performed with the standalone version of BLAST [51,70],
against the NCBI non redundant protein, nucleotide and
EST databases available on November 2007 [71]. Parsing
of the BLAST results was performed with the Bio::SearchIO module from the Bioperl package [72]. Coding
sequences were annotated with GO terms using Blast2GO
[48]. SPUTNIK [50] was used to identify simple sequence
repeats (SSRs), and POLYBAYES [62] to search for SNPs.
SNP validation
DNA extraction was done from leaf tissues of C. clementina
cv Nules using the DNeasy® Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen).

PCR amplifications of the samples were performed using
a Mastercycler epgradiend S thermocycler (Eppendorf) in
100 μL final volume containing 0.025 U/μL of Pfu DNA
polymerase (Fermentas), 0.2 ng/μL of genomic DNA, 0.2
mM of each dNTP, 2 mM MgSO4, 75 mM Tris-HCl (pH
8.8), 20 mM (NH4)2SO4, 0.2 μM of each primers. The
following PCR program was applied: denaturation at 94°
C for 5 min and 35 repeats of the following cycle: 30 s at
94°C, 1 min at 55°C or 60°C (according to primers Tm),
45 s at 72°C; and final elongation step of 4 min at 72°C.
PCR product purification was done directly or after cutting single bands on agarose gel, using respectively
QIAquick® PCR Purification Kit and QIAquick® Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen)
Sequencing was carried out on ABI3730 equipment with
"Dye Terminator" process using ABI kit version 3.1. SNPs
were identified as double peaks by manual inspection of
chromatograms, and subsequently validated
