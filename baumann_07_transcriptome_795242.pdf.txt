Abstract
Background: The cell cycle of all organisms includes mass increase by a factor of two, replication of the
genetic material, segregation of the genome to different parts of the cell, and cell division into two daughter
cells. It is tightly regulated and typically includes cell cycle-specific oscillations of the levels of transcripts,
proteins, protein modifications, and signaling molecules. Until now cell cycle-specific transcriptome
changes have been described for four eukaryotic species ranging from yeast to human, but only for two
prokaryotic species. Similarly, oscillations of small signaling molecules have been identified in very few
eukaryotic species, but not in any prokaryote.
Results: A synchronization procedure for the archaeon Halobacterium salinarum was optimized, so that
nearly 100% of all cells divide in a time interval that is 1/4th of the generation time of exponentially growing
cells. The method was used to characterize cell cycle-dependent transcriptome changes using a genomewide DNA microarray. The transcript levels of 87 genes were found to be cell cycle-regulated,
corresponding to 3% of all genes. They could be clustered into seven groups with different transcript level
profiles. Cluster-specific sequence motifs were detected around the start of the genes that are predicted
to be involved in cell cycle-specific transcriptional regulation. Notably, many cell cycle genes that have
oscillating transcript levels in eukaryotes are not regulated on the transcriptional level in H. salinarum.
Synchronized cultures were also used to identify putative small signaling molecules. H. salinarum was found
to contain a basal cAMP concentration of 200 μM, considerably higher than that of yeast. The cAMP
concentration is shortly induced directly prior to and after cell division, and thus cAMP probably is an
important signal for cell cycle progression.
Conclusion: The analysis of cell cycle-specific transcriptome changes of H. salinarum allowed to identify
a strategy of transcript level regulation that is different from all previously characterized species. The
transcript levels of only 3% of all genes are regulated, a fraction that is considerably lower than has been
reported for four eukaryotic species (6% – 28%) and for the bacterium C. crescentus (19%).
It was shown that cAMP is present in significant concentrations in an archaeon, and the phylogenetic profile
of the adenylate cyclase indicates that this signaling molecule is widely distributed in archaea. The
occurrence of cell cycle-dependent oscillations of the cAMP concentration in an archaeon and in several
eukaryotic species indicates that cAMP level changes might be a phylogenetically old signal for cell cycle
progression.

Background
The cell cycle is characterized by periodic events that have
to occur in the lifetime of nearly every cell, e.g. mass
increase by a factor of two, DNA replication, DNA segregation, and cell division. The eukaryotic cell cycle includes
a stage of high chromosome condensation, resulting in
mitotic chromosomes that are visible in the light microscope, and has therefore attracted attention during the last
centuries. Interest in the prokaryotic cell cycle has
increased substantially during the last decade. Examples
for keynote discoveries are: 1) the bacterial chromosome
is not randomly distributed in the cell, but is highly
organized, 2) replication takes place at midcell at a fixed
replisome, while the DNA is actively transported in
archaea and bacteria, and 3) specific degradation of cell
cycle regulatory proteins occurs at least in bacteria. Several
reviews illustrate the state of the art and current questions
of cell cycle research with eukaryotes, bacteria, and
archaea [1-9]. It should be noted that the research concentrates on very few model species, including 1) the eukaryotes Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe,
and human cell lines, 2) the bacteria Caulobacter crescentus, Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli, and 3) the archaea
Sulfolobus acidocaldarius and Halobacterium salinarum.

acidocaldarius, which belongs to the kingdom of Crenarchaeota [21].
A prerequisite for the determination of cell cycle-dependent transcriptome changes is a method to synchronize cell
cultures. Cell synchronization procedures have been
described for only a very limited number of species. These
include budding yeast and fission yeast, human cell lines,
E. coli, B. subtilis, C. crescentus, S. acidocaldarius and H. salinarum.
Here, we present an optimized synchronization procedure
for H. salinarum that yields a very high degree of synchronization. Synchronized cultures were used to characterize
cell cycle-dependent transcriptome changes in an archaeal
species. The results are discussed and compared with the
results obtained for four eukaryotic and two prokaryotic
species. Furthermore, it was revealed that the concentration of the signaling molecule cAMP oscillates within the
cell cycle. The results together with the results of an earlier
study, e.g. the characterization of cell cycle-dependent
dynamic intracellular localization of the DNA, yield an
integrated overview of an archaeal cell cycle.

Results
In all three domains of life it was found that the levels of
specific transcripts and proteins vary in a cell cycledependent manner. The first global analyses of cell cycledependent transcript level changes were performed with
the budding yeast S. cerevisiae, and several hundreds of
transcripts were found to oscillate [10,11]. Recently three
independent transcriptome studies of the S. pombe cell
cycle have been reported, and the transcript levels of 400
and 750 genes were found to be cell cycle-regulated [1214]. A meta-analysis of the three datasets came to the conclusion that the combined dataset allows to identify about
500 genes as being cell cycle-regulated [15]. About the
same number of genes were found to be cell cycle-regulated in an Arabidopsis cell line. However, the real number
in Arabidopsis is higher, because a microarray covering
only one-third of the genome was used [16]. Until now
three independent approaches have been reported that
used whole genome DNA microarrays to study transcript
level changes within the human cell cycle [17-19]. It was
found that 700 and 900 genes are cell cycle regulated in
fibroblasts and in HeLa cells, respectively.
In contrast to the availability of 10 independent transcriptome studies with eukaryotes, a single study has been
reported for a bacterial species, i.e. C. crescentus [20]. It
was revealed that the transcript levels of 553 genes are cell
cycle-regulated, corresponding to 19% of the genome.
Very recently characterization of cell cycle-dependent
transcriptome changes have been reported for Sulfolobus

Synchronization of H. salinarum cultures
The previously described synchronization procedure for
H. salinarum involves treatment of an exponentially growing culture with the DNA polymerase inhibitor aphidicolin for four hours. After inhibitor removal and cell
washing, a synchronized culture was obtained [22]. Different steps of the procedure were optimized. The most
important points are 1) that the number of generations of
exponential growth prior to synchronization was considerably increased (now growth for more than 40 generations is routinely used), and 2) that the culture is not
treated with aphidicolin for a fixed time span, but aphidicolin is removed as the cells reach an average length of 5.7
μm. Fig. 1 shows the cell density and the average cell
length profiles of a culture treated according to the optimized protocol. Nearly 100% of all cells divide within
one hour, which is short in comparison to the four hour
generation time of exponentially growing H. salinarum.
Cells with a visible constriction were seen exclusively during this one hour period (Fig. 1). The high degree of synchrony makes H. salinarum cultures optimally suited to
study cell cycle-related processes, e.g. differential transcript level regulation.

To address the question of how long synchrony persists,
we characterized a culture for two cell cycles following
synchronization. As it is typical for whole culture synchronization methods, it turned out that the degree of synchrony is higher for the first than for the second cycle and
thus the first cycle is more informative (data not shown).

Figure 1
Optimized synchronization of H. salinarum cultures
Optimized synchronization of H. salinarum cultures.
The synchronization was performed as described in Experimental Procedures using the DNA polymerase inhibitor
aphidicolin. The average cell length and its standard deviation
was calculated from the lengths of 50 cells that were determined microscopically with an ocular micrometer. The cell
density was determined microscopically with a Neubauer
counting chamber. Times of addition and removal of the
inhibitor are indicated. The time of inhibitor removal was set
to zero to allow a direct comparison of the times shown in
this and additional Figures (2 – 6, see Additional file 1). The
box in this and additional Figures denotes the only time interval in which dividing cells with visible constrictions could be
observed. Microscopic images of dividing cells and the intracellular DNA localization have been published previously [22].

Therefore we chose to concentrate on the first cycle for the
characterization of cell cycle-dependent transcriptome
changes, which allowed to analyze the transcriptome at a
high number of time points.
Cell cycle-dependent transcriptome changes
For the characterization of cell cycle-dependent transcriptome changes a DNA microarray was used that had been
constructed in collaboration with the group of Dieter
Oesterhelt (MPI for Biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany).
It is comprised of gene-specific PCR products that represent more than 95% of all genes that were annotated in
the course of the H. salinarum genome project [23].

Aliquots of a synchronized culture were removed at 10
time points and used for RNA isolation. As a control, a
culture was used that was treated identically except that
the aphidicolin addition was omitted. Generation and
labeling of cDNAs, competitive hybridization, DNA
microarray processing and data handling are described in
the Methods section. Three independent experiments
(biological replicates) were performed and the results
were analyzed as described (Methods). The number of
genes with cell cycle-regulated transcript levels is surprisingly small. Out of 2457 genes that generated signals for
at least seven time points, only the transcript levels of 87
genes were found to be cell cycle-regulated. These genes
are summarized in Table 1. They are not randomly distributed in the genome, but more than half of them were
found to be part of 16 gene clusters or operons (Table 1).
22 genes are annotated as "hypothetical" or "conserved
hypothetical", but the characterization of their cell cycleregulated expression has proven that these are real genes.
The 87 genes were grouped, based on their cell cycle-specific transcriptional profiles, and seven clusters of co-regulated genes were discovered. The average transcript level
profiles of all seven clusters are shown in Fig. 2. Clusters
one to four are comprised of transcripts that were transiently up-regulated in the course of the cell cycle and
relax back to their original level (25 genes). The time of
maximal transient induction is different for the four clusters, e.g. one hour after inhibitor removal for cluster one
and three hours later for cluster four. Cluster five is characterized by transcripts that have a constant transcript
level for the first 1.5 h after inhibitor removal and are
induced thereafter (34 genes). Cluster six contains transcripts that were transiently down-regulated (2 genes),
with a minimal transcript level at the time of cell division.
Cluster seven contains transcripts that were down-regulated in the five hours after inhibitor removal (17 genes).
The expression profiles of only nine genes did not belong
to any of the seven clusters (Table 1).
Verification of dynamic transcript level patterns
Ten cell cycle-regulated genes representing all different
transcriptional profiles and three unregulated control
genes were chosen arbitrarily and used for verification of
the DNA microarray results with an independent method.
Aliquots were removed from synchronized cultures at
eight time points and used for RNA isolation. The amount
of transcript of the 13 genes was determined by Northern
blot analyses with gene-specific probes. Fig. 3, 4, 5 shows
a comparison of the results of the DNA microarray analysis (average of three biological replicates) and of the
Northern blot analysis (one typical experiment). In all
cases the results generated by the two different methods
are in congruence, underscoring the quality of the microarray data.

Figure transcript level profiles of seven clusters of co-regulated genes
Average2
Average transcript level profiles of seven clusters of co-regulated genes. Most of the cell cycle-regulated transcripts
were sorted into seven clusters of co-regulated genes (compare text and Table 1). The average transcription profiles of all
seven clusters and the standard deviations are shown. Genes that share an identical profile of induction and repression do not
necessarily share the same degree of induction/repression, therefore the transcript profiles of all genes were normalized to
their highest value (= 100%) before calculation of averages and standard deviations. Gene identifiers, names, and functional
classes are summarized in Table 1.

Comparison of results obtained by DNA microarray analysis and by Northern blot analysis. 13 genes were
selected for verification of the microarray results with an independent method, i.e. Northern blot analysis. They represent all
clusters of co-regulated genes as well as unregulated control genes. The transcript level profiles obtained for individual genes

Cell cycle-regulated genes of H. salinarum
The genes included in the seven clusters with different
transcriptional profiles were examined to identify biological processes that are cell cycle regulated in haloarchaea
(Table 1 and Fig. 2). Cluster three is comprised exclusively
of genes encoding enzymes of the purine biosynthesis
pathway (Fig. 2). Of the remaining genes of the pathway,
one is not represented on the microarray and one was
found to have a nearly constant transcript level. An oscil-

lation of the purine biosynthetic pathway in the cell cycle
and the highest level of induction after cell division, prior
to the next replication phase, is in line with the biological
function. Intuitively, the regulation of the purine genes
would be expected to be accompanied by a similar regulation of the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. However,
none of the genes for pyrimidine biosynthesis are cell
cycle-regulated (see Additional file 1), indicating that
pyrimidine biosynthesis is regulated differently.

Figure 5
Comparison of results obtained by DNA microarray analysis and by Northern blot analysis
Comparison of results obtained by DNA microarray analysis and by Northern blot analysis. 13 genes were
selected for verification of the microarray results with an independent method, i.e. Northern blot analysis. They represent all
clusters of co-regulated genes as well as unregulated control genes. The transcript level profiles obtained for individual genes
by microarray analysis are shown on the left side (average of three biological replicates). On the right side the results of Northern blot analysis are shown (one typical experiment). Gene identifier [23] and the gene No. in Table 1 are included.

Cluster five contains 34 genes with highest transcript levels about 1.5 hours after cell division (Fig. 2). Several of
them had a very low transcript level until cell division was
completed and were rapidly induced thereafter, similar to
the M/G1 induced genes found in eukaryotes (an example
is OE4676F, No. 58 shown in Fig. 3, 4, 5). This cluster is
characterized by a very high fraction of genes of unknown
function (13 of 34) in comparison to the other clusters. 10
genes encode subunits of three different ABC transporters.
These transporters might be specific for substrates that are

needed specifically after cell division, e.g. for purines and
pyrimidines needed for replication.
Cluster six is comprised of only two genes that form an
operon. The two genes overlap by three nucleotides and
were proven to be co-transcribed by Northern blot analysis. The transcript levels are down-regulated until the cells
divide, and are up-regulated thereafter (Fig. 2). One of the
genes encodes a transcriptional regulator (OE1797R). It
belongs to COG1321 ("Mn-containing transcriptional

BMC Cell Biology 2007, 8:21

regulators") and has orthologs in all archaeal genomes.
The second deduced protein (OE1794R) has no similarity
to any protein of known function, but is proposed to have
five membrane-spanning helices and thus could be a
membrane-bound sensor. These gene products might turn
out to play an important role for cell cycle progression
and will be further characterized.
Cluster seven contains 17 genes whose transcript levels
constantly decrease throughout the experiment and are
not up-regulated again. Five genes encode an ABC transporter that is annotated to be phosphate-specific, and four
genes encode all enzymes for arginine fermentation. The
highest level of induction at the time of inhibitor removal
and the noncyclic profile make it possible that cluster
seven genes were artificially induced due to the synchronization protocol, in spite of the fact that the control culture
was treated identically except for aphidicolin addition.
However, if this would be true, it would only strengthen
the result that the fraction of cell cycle-regulated genes is
much lower in H. salinarum than in the six other species
investigated thus far.
It is noteworthy that the transcript levels of only very few
cell cycle genes are cell cycle-regulated. One example is
Sph1 (cluster two; No. 11 in Fig. 3, 4, 5), a member of the
SMC protein family [24]. It was previously reported to be
cell cycle-regulated on the transcript level as well as on the
protein level [22]. Another example is a gene encoding a
homologue of the eukaryotic protein Cdc6 that is
involved in replication initiation (Table 1; No. 85 in Fig.
3, 4, 5). However, the H. salinarum genome contains nine
cdc6 genes, and the other eight genes are expressed constitutively (see Additional file 1).
Transcripts of many more cell cycle genes are cell cycleregulated in other species (see Discussion). While the regulation is not well conserved, some genes are cell cycleregulated in two Yeasts, Arabidopsis, and humans. To
ensure that the regulation of these genes has not escaped
the analysis of the microarray results, the transcriptional
profiles of 26 genes were checked, encoding i.e. the
haloarchaeal histone, subunits of the DNA polymerase,
three proteins of the SMC family, several Cdc48
homologs, and several homologs of the cell division control protein Cdc6 (see Additional file 1). Clearly, none of
the genes is cell cycle-regulated in H. salinarum.
Detection of conserved cluster-specific DNA motifs
Similar transcriptional profiles of genes indicate shared
transcriptional regulators. To identify putative regulatory
motifs, cluster-specific multiple sequence alignments
were produced including the region from -200 nt to +200
nt centered around the translational start point. This will
more or less also align the transcriptional start points,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/8/21

because the majority of haloarchaeal transcripts is leaderless (Brenneis, Hering and Soppa, in preparation). In all
cases where the intergenic region between two genes was
smaller than 40 nt, they were considered to be part of an
operon and only the first gene was included into the analysis. As many genes are part of putative operons (Table 1),
the number of cell cycle-specific promoters is considerably smaller than the number of cell cycle-specific genes.
Nevertheless, conserved sequence motifs were found for
six of the seven clusters. The only exception is cluster six,
which is comprised of two genes in one operon and thus
could not be analyzed. Table 2 summarizes the consensus
sequences, the number of promoters, the average occurrence per promoter, the strand-specificity and the average
P-value. Fig. 6A gives an overview of the distribution of
the consensus motif around the start site of cluster five
genes. Unexpectedly, the motif is found both upstream
and downstream of the start site. With only two exceptions the region between -70 nt and +40 nt is totally
devoid of the motif. This eliminates the mechanism of
transcriptional regulation which was found to be true for
most archaeal promoters that have been studied until
now, i.e. that binding of a negative regulator inhibits
binding of the basal transcription factors TBP and TFB
and/or of the RNA polymerase [25]. A sequence logo of
the cluster five motif is shown in Fig. 6B. It is extremely
GC-rich and includes a short direct repeat, i.e. "CGCCG".
Further studies will clarify whether regulatory proteins
bind to this and the other cluster-specific consensus
sequences and whether they are essential for cell cyclespecific expression of the genes.
Cell cycle-dependent levels of the putative signaling
molecule cAMP
The small number of cell cycle-regulated genes and the
absence of regulation for many genes with conserved cell
cycle-specific regulation in eukaryotes indicates that cell
cycle-regulation of many H. salinarum genes might occur
at the posttranscriptional level. Characterization of cell
cycle-dependent changes of the proteome will be performed in a subsequent study. Here we report the identification of cell cycle-dependent concentration changes of
a small signaling molecule, i.e. cAMP. cAMP was chosen
because the cAMP level was found to oscillate in the cell
cycle of several eukaryotic species. Haloarchaea are exceptionally well suited for the determination of short-lived
metabolites because cell lysis is very rapid after an osmotic
downshift. A method for quantitative cAMP determination was established, and it was found that H. salinarum
cultures growing exponentially in complex medium (2 –
5 × 108 cells/ml) contain between 200 and 300 fmoles/
109 cells. This is equivalent to about 1 – 2 × 105 cAMP
molecules per cell. Well-energized cultures contain about
5 × 106 ATP molecules per cell, therefore cAMP is generated from several percent of the available ATP (data not

shown). Next, aliquots were removed from synchronized
cultures at 30 minutes intervals and the cAMP levels were
determined. Three independent experiments did not
allow to clarify whether the cAMP levels changed in a cell
cycle-dependent manner. It was obvious that no change
occurred during the first 1.5 hours and the last 1.5 hours,
but the time from 1.5 to 3.5 hours gave inconclusive
results (data not shown). Therefore the time resolution
was increased and the period from 1.5 to 3.5 hours after
aphidicolin removel was investigated in 15 minutes intervals. Fig. 7A shows the result of one out of three independent experiments, and Fig. 7B shows the average cAMP
levels of all three biological replicates. The cAMP level rapidly and reversibly increases at two time points just prior
to and just after cell division, while it drops to basal level
in between. The cell cycle-dependent concentration
change of this signaling molecule indicates that it is
involved in the regulation of cell cycle processes.

observed to be synchronized as a result of the block/
release protocol of replication: 1) septum formation and
cell division, 2) DNA transport and the dynamic intracellular DNA localization [22], 3) transcript levels of seven
clusters of genes with different transcript level profiles, 4)
the Sph1 protein level [22], and 5) the cAMP concentration. This shows that key elements of the cell cycle are
dependent on the successful termination of DNA replication, and a cell cycle checkpoint exists which inhibits cell
division in case of replication problems. Importantly, the
energy and the anabolic metabolisms are not coupled to
replication, and cells elongate with the normal rate of
unsynchronized control cultures. As it is typical for wholeculture methods, the degree of synchronization is rapidly
lost and is already considerably lower in the second cycle
following the block/release protocol.

Discussion

An aphidicolin block/release protocol was also successfully used to synchronize plant cells of several species, i.e.
Arabidopsis and tobacco [16,26]. Synchrony was verified
by studying the chromosome content using FACS analysis, by quantitation of S-phase cells and by counting metaphase and anaphase cells. An Arabidopsis cell line was
used to characterize cell cycle-dependent transcript level
changes using a microarray that is based on a subgenomic
cDNA library, and many transcripts were found to be cell
cycle-regulated [16].

Synchronization of H. salinarum and eukaryotes with
aphidicolin block/release protocols
The optimized synchronization procedure yields cultures
with a very high degree of synchrony, i.e. nearly 100% of
all cells divide in a time period that is equal to 1/4th of the
generation time of exponentially growing cells (4 hours).
Because the transcript level profiles of the first and the last
hour of the five hour period of transcriptome characterization are not identical (Fig. 2 and 3) the first cycle after
inhibitor removal seems to be longer than four hours, and
thus the cells divide in a fraction of the cell cycle that is
even smaller than 1/4. The synchronization method is
based on the inhibition of replication by aphidicolin and
its subsequent release. A variety of cell cycle features were

Aphidicolin block/relase protocols have also often been
used to synchronize human cell lines. However, it has
recently been reported for two different cell lines (HL-60,
HeLa) that it induces apoptosis preferentially in S-phase
cells [27]. Therefore the apparent "synchronization" was
caused to a large extend by the selective killing of S-phase
cells and the arrest of cells at the entrance of S-phase. The
surviving synchronized cells were found to contain DNA
damaged by double strand breaks and thus this synchronization procedure is not suitable for human cell lines. In
contrast, no decrease in cell viability was observed in H.
salinarum (Fig. 1), and thus it can be concluded that the
method, like in plants, generates highly synchronized cul-

The genome of H. salinarum contains a gene for an adenylate cyclase (OE2856F), while similarity searches did
not lead to the identification of a phosphodiesterase. The
transcript of OE2856F is not cell-cycle regulated, and
therefore the cAMP level is regulated post-transcriptionally.

Analysis of cell cycle-specific transcriptome changes with
DNA microarrays
The application of DNA microarrays for the identification
of cell cycle-regulated transcripts has caused considerable
discussions. There are two major lines of concern: 1) Independent studies with S. cerevisiae and with S. pombe all
identified a high number of cell cycle-regulated genes, but
the overlap was unexpectedly small, e.g. three studies with
S. pombe identified 407, 747 and 750 cell cycle-regulated
genes, but only 171 genes were commonly found in all
three studies [12-14]. 2) Using the same set of data, different bioinformatic analysis methods yielded different
results, e.g. the original analysis of the results obtained
with C. crescentus indicated that 553 genes are periodically
expressed [20], while the re-analysis of Wichert et al. [28]
and of Chen et al. [29] identified only 44 genes and 43
genes, respectively. However, both reanalysis methods
relied solely on the periodicity of transcript levels, without
taking the degree of regulation into account. Both discussions underscore the great importance of a high-quality
method for the analysis of microarray results.

Cell cycle-dependent changes of the cAMP level
Cell cycle-dependent changes of the cAMP level. The
cAMP level was determined in synchronized cultures, and it
was revealed that concentration changes might occur in the
time period between 1.5 and 3.5 hours (data not shown).
Therefore this period was characterized with a higher time
resolution of 15 minutes. The box in A and B denotes the
time period of cell division (compare Fig. 1). A. One out of
three biological replicates is shown. The cAMP concentration
was determined in duplicate measurements, and the cell density was determined with a Neubauer counting chamber. B.

deviation.

tures. These can yield important information about
archaeal cell cycle progression and its regulation.

A meta-analysis compared the quality of six different
microarray analysis methods [30]. Three non-overlapping
benchmarking sets of genes were used, that contained cell
cycle genes of yeast, i.e. 1) periodically expressed genes
identified in a small-scale study, 2) genes whose promoters were co-immunoprecipitated with known cell cycle
transcription factors, and 3) genes that are annotated as
"cell cycle genes" in the MIPS database. It was examined
how well the six different methods were able to identify
genes from these benchmarking sets in the published
microarray datasets of the S. cerevisiae cell cycle [10,11]. It
was revealed that methods that concentrate solely on the
periodicity and are independent of the magnitude of
expression change do not perform well. Quite unexpectedly it was discovered that visual inspection after bioinformatic removal of unregulated genes performed better
than any of the five solely computational methods on two
of the benchmark sets. However, at these sets it was done
non-blindly and that might have influenced the outcome.
On the third set visual inspection was done blindly and
the result was comparable to the better computational
methods and much better than one computational
method [30]. Therefore, on the S. cerevisiae cell cycle data
set visual inspection is at least comparable to computational methods.
We started to analyze the H. salinarum cell cycle data with
a commercial DNA microarray analysis software (Genespring, Silicon Genetics) which we have very successfully
used in several previous studies [31] (Zaparty et al., in
preparation). However, although we applied several different clustering algorithms we were not satisfied with the
results. Upon visual inspection it became obvious that

Page 13 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Cell Biology 2007, 8:21

they contained false-positives, e.g. transcripts that had an
elevated level only at one time point and had a very large
standard deviation at this time point. Therefore we
decided to use visual inspection for the identification of
cell cycle-regulated genes (compare Methods), and found
the results superior to the application of a commercial
DNA microarray analysis software.
Comparison of Halobacterium with eukaryotes, with
Caulobacter and with Sulfolobus
This study revealed that transcript levels of about 3% of
the H. salinarum genes are cell cycle-regulated. This fraction is considerably lower than for all other species whose
transcriptomes have been studied, i.e. S. cerevisiae (about
8%) [30], S. pombe (about 10%) [15], A. thaliana (about
6%) [16], Homo sapiens (about 18% to 28%) [17,19], C.
crescentus (about 19%) [20], and S. acidocaldarius (8.5% or
18%, see below) [21]. In addition to the quantitative difference, there is also a qualitative difference between the
transcriptional programs of H. salinarum and all other species studied until now. In the four eukaryotes, the transcripts of many important cell cycle proteins were found
to be periodically regulated. These include cyclins, checkpoint kinases, regulators and enzymes of nucleotide
metabolisms, histones, myosins, kinesins etc.. The conserved core of genes that are cyclic in several species is
rather small and thus cell cycle regulation and the level at
which it is exerted is poorly conserved in eukaryotes. Even
the two yeasts S. cerevisiae and S. pombe deviate considerably [15,30]. Nevertheless, the regulation of several genes
encoding cell cycle proteins is conserved from yeast to
humans, including histones, the Cdc6 protein involved in
replication initiation, DNA polymerases, and proteins of
the SMC family. With only two exceptions, these genes are
not cell cycle-regulated in H. salinarum (see Additional file
1). This underscores that the conservation of regulatory
mechanisms is much lower than the conservation of proteins and their functions.

In Halobacterium, only 14 genes with cell cycle-specific
functions are regulated on the transcriptional level: one
paralog of the cdc6 gene (eight paralogs are not regulated),
one member of the SMC protein family (three are not regulated), nine genes of the purine biosynthesis pathway
(pyrimidine biosynthesis is not regulated) and three additional genes encoding enzymes involved in nucleotide
metabolism. This number is not only much smaller than
in the four eukaryotes, but also than in the only bacterium
investigated, C. crescentus. In Caulobacter, about 40 genes
encoding response regulators, histidine kinases and sigma
factors as well as nearly 50 genes encoding proteins
involved in DNA replication, nucleotide synthesis, DNA
repair, chromosome segregation and cell division were
found to be periodic [20].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/8/21

While this paper was under review the results of a characterization of cell cycle-dependent transcriptome changes
of S. acidocaldarius were published [21]. 346 transcripts
were reported to be differentially regulated, 166 in a
"cyclic" way and 200 in a "gradual" way. For two reasons
it appears that only part of a cell cycle has been characterized: 1) the transcript profiles of most of the cyclic genes
do not relax to their previous level after transient induction and 2) the fraction of genes with known cell cyclespecific functions is identical in the cyclic fraction and the
gradual fraction. Therefore it seems that all 346 genes
must at least be considered to be cell cycle-regulated. Half
of the genes encode hypothetical proteins, a fraction that
is considerably higher than in H. salinarum (Table 1). Similar to H. salinarum, the transcript levels of purine biosynthesis enzymes is regulated, in contrast to the pyrimidine
biosynthesis pathway. In total about 30 transcripts encoding proteins with known cell cycle functions are regulated.
Encoded proteins include 14 enzymes involved in nucleotide metabolism, three Cdc6 homologs, five additional
proteins involved in replication, and four DNA repair proteins.
Taken together, H. salinarum has a different regulatory
strategy than all other species studied until now. It has a
tight cell cycle control, but is lacking periodic transcriptional control of many cell cycle proteins. The data indicate that the control is exerted on the translational and/or
posttranslational level. While the characterization of proteome changes is the focus of an independent project, cell
cycle-dependent concentration changes of the signaling
molecule cAMP could indeed be verified and indicate
posttranslational control mechanisms.
Promoter structure of cell cycle-regulated genes
A shared transcriptional profile of genes indicates that
they form a regulon and are regulated by a common transcriptional regulator. Indeed, the comparison of the
upstream regions of co-regulated yeast genes allowed the
detection of consensus sequences for the binding of
known cell cycle-specific transcription factors as well as of
novel consensus sequences for unknown factors [11].
Similarly, the comparison of the sequences around the
start sites of cell cycle-regulated genes of H. salinarum
revealed the existence of cluster-specific conserved
sequence motifs. Cell cycle transcription factors have not
yet been identified for H. salinarum or any archaeal species. The cluster-specific conserved motifs will lead to the
identification of regulatory proteins and will help to
unravel the mechanism of cell cycle-specific transcriptional control in the model archaeon H. salinarum.

The signaling molecule cAMP and its cell cycle-specific
concentration changes
It is long known that cAMP has important roles as a signaling molecule in bacteria and in eukaryotes. A very early
report revealed that cAMP occurs also in three archaeal
species, and it was speculated that it might be a signal for
carbon starvation, similar to its role in E. coli [33]. But this
result was not followed up and the distribution of cAMP
in archaea and its functional role remained unknown. A
bioinformatics analysis revealed that a gene encoding a
putative adenylate cyclase is present in 16 out of the 20
archaeal genomes known in 2004, and that it is absent
only in Picrophilus torridus, Nanoarchaeum equitans, and
two species of Thermoplasma [34].

Here we show that H. salinarum contains on average about
1 – 2 × 105 cAMP molecules per cell. The amount is in congruence with the number of about 5 × 106 ATP molecules
per cell and shows that several percent of ATP are converted to cAMP. The genome of H. salinarum contains a
gene for the enzyme that catalyzes this conversion, i.e. an
adenylate cyclase (OE2856F). A blast search led to the
detection of 28 archaeal orthologs and underscored that
this enzyme is widespread in archaea. Therefore it can be
concluded that cAMP plays a role as a signaling molecule
in most archaeal species. A gene encoding a phosphodiesterase could not be identified in the genome of H. salinarum by similarity searches using sequences of known
cAMP phosphodiesterases, and thus the identity of the
enzyme for cAMP degradation cannot be predicted.
If a typical H. salinarum cell is approximated by a cylinder
of 4 μm length and 0.5 μm diameter, the amount of 1 – 2
× 105 cAMP molecules per cell are equivalent to an intracellular concentration of about 200 μM. This is considerably higher than reported for S. cerevisiae. The volume of a
typical yeast cell is about 100 fl. Therefore the reported
cAMP values are equivalent to concentrations of 0.3 μM,
1 μM and 6 μM. The cAMP level in synchronized yeast cultures was measured in three independent studies, and
they all agree that there are cell cycle-specific fluctuations
[35-37]. Müller et al. [35] reported sharp increases in the
cAMP concentration that occur at different times in the
cell cycle depending on glucose availability. They point
out that cAMP integrates energy metabolism and cell cycle
control in yeast. Another eukaryote, Tetrahymena pyriformis, was found to have one short peak of elevated cAMP
concentration precisely at the time of cell division [38]. In
H. salinarum two short cAMP peaks were found prior to
and after cell division, while the concentration dropped to
average level in between. This pattern is different from the
concentration changes reported for eukaryotic species.
However, the common theme in all species is a very short
time of concentration change.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/8/21

It remains to be discovered whether the cAMP peaks in H.
salinarum are instrumental for cell cycle progression, and
whether cAMP is also involved in metabolic control. In
conclusion, it has been revealed for the first time that the
cAMP level is sharply and reversibly elevated at two points
during an archaeal cell cycle and may thus play a similar
role than proposed for several eukaryotic species. If cAMP
oscillations could be detected in further archaeal and
eukaryotic species, this would indicate an early evolutionary role of cAMP in cell cycle signaling. In addition, it
might be an evolutionary old signal for the integration of
the energy status and cell cycle progression.

Conclusion
H. salinarum is one of two archaeal and of very few
prokaryotic species that can be synchronized. The degree
of synchrony is very high and thus H. salinarum is ideally
suited to study cell cycle-dependent processes. In this and
the previous study [22] it was used to characterize various
cell cycle-dependent processes, i.e. 1) septum formation
and cell division, 2) specific intracellular DNA localization and its dynamics, 3) transcripts level changes of
selected genes, 4) changes of the transcriptome, 5) Sph1
protein level oscillations, and 6) concentration changes of
the signaling molecule cAMP.
Fig. 8 gives an overview of the different events. At all levels
(transcript, protein, small molecules, intracellular transport) tight cell cycle-dependent regulation was observed.
The reversible inductions follow a strict time schedule,
which is especially evident for the fast oscillations of the
cAMP concentration. The virtual absence of transcriptional regulation of genes encoding regulatory proteins
indicates that a major part of cell cycle regulation probably occurs at the posttranscriptional level. The existence of
at least one cell cycle checkpoint in H. salinarum can be
concluded, because cell division and several additional
cell cycle events are inhibited after a block in replication,
and are executed synchronously after release of the block.
Further studies will identify changes of the proteome and
the role of cell cycle proteins for cell cycle progression.

Methods
Strains and culture conditions
The Halobacterium salinarum type strain was obtained
from the German Culture Collection ("Deutsche
Sammlung für Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen",
Braunschweig, Germany; Strain No. DSM670). [39] It was
grown in complex medium as described [40].
Synchronization of H. salinarum cultures
Each experiment was started with a single colony that was
freshly grown on solid complex medium. It was used to
inoculate 20 ml complex medium in a 100 ml Erlenmeyer
flask. After two days of incubation at 42°C in a rotary

shaker (250 rpm), it was checked that the resulting culture
was in mid-exponential growth phase (2 – 6 × 108 cells/
ml). An aliquot was used to inoculate a further culture,
which was verified to be in mid-exponential growth phase
one day later. The required inoculum was calculated using
a generation time of 4 hours. A third culture was inoculated from the second culture. The inoculum was calculated so that the third culture had a cell density of 2 – 4 ×
108 cells/ml the following morning. In this way it was
guaranteed that the culture had been growing in exponential growth phase for more than 40 generations.
To start the synchronization, aphidicolin was added to a
final concentration of about 30 μM. Aphidicolin was purchased from Serva (Heidelberg, Germany) and dissolved
at a concentration of 30 mM in DMSO. Aliquots of this
solution were stored at -80°C and only thawed once. The
exact concentration to reach an ideal synchronization
result was readjusted empirically for every new lot of
aphidicolin (concentration range of 25 – 35 μM). Aliquots were withdrawn from the aphidicolin-containing
culture and used to determine the cell density (using a
Neubauer counting chamber) and the average cell length.
The average cell length and its standard deviation were
calculated from the lengths of 50 cells that had been determined using an ocular micrometer. The culture was incubated until the average cell length reached 5.7 μm. The
cells were harvested by centrifugation (4500 g, 6 min.,
42°C, pre-warmed rotor and centrifuge chamber). The
pellet was resuspended in pre-warmed medium and the
cells were incubated for 10 minutes in the rotary shaker to
wash away residual aphidicolin. The cells were washed
again as described above. Progression of the resulting syn-

chronized culture through the cell cycle was followed by
determination of the cell density and the average cell
length at regular intervals. Synchronized cultures were
used to determine the cell cycle dependent alterations of
the transcriptome, selected transcript levels, and the cAMP
level, as described in the Results section.
Transcriptome analysis with a DNA microarray
For the analysis of the transcriptome throughout the cell
cycle, every culture of the three biological replicates was
synchronized as described above, and a control culture
was treated identically, except that the addition of aphidicolin was omitted. Aliquots of 9 × 108 cells were removed
from both cultures at ten time points. RNA was isolated
with the RNA isolation mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions, but
omitting the incubation with lysozyme. A DNA contamination was excluded by a DNase treatment while the RNA
was bound to the ion exchange column. The RNA concentration was determined photometrically, and the integrity
was checked by analytical agarose gel electrophoresis. The
control RNA samples were pooled, thus generating an
unsynchronized control averaged over the 5 hour period
that was chosen to study the synchronized culture. Notably the control had experienced the same handling steps
(centrifugation, resuspension) as the synchronized culture.

cDNA synthesis from sample and control RNA (15 μg
each), concomitant labeling with Cy3-dUTP or Cy5dUTP, mixing of sample and control, removal of unincorporated label, and concentration were performed as
described previously [31].

The DNA microarray for H. salinarum was constructed in
collaboration with the group of Dieter Oesterhelt (MPI for
Biochemistry, Martinsried). It contains gene-specific PCR
products for more than 95% of the nearly 2800 genes that
were annotated within the genome sequencing project of
the Oesterhelt group in April 2002 [23]. Construction of
the DNA microarray will be described in detail elsewhere
(Lange et al., in preparation). Slide preparation, competitive hybridization of samples from synchronized cultures
and the pooled unsynchronized control, washing and drying of slides were performed as described previously [31],
except that a hybridization temperature of 67°C was used.
The slides were scanned using an Axon 4000A scanner
(Axon Instruments, Union City, CA, USA), laser intensities were chosen to get roughly equal average signals for
the Cy3- and Cy5-channel.
Analysis of DNA microarray data
Scanning of 30 DNA microarrays (10 cell cycle time
points, triplicate measurements), each containing about
2800 gene-specific spots, had generated more than 80000
data points. After automatic spot detection and signal
integration, all data points were visually inspected using
the software Genepix Pro 3.0 (Axon Instruments, Union
City, CA, USA). Weak spots and spots containing fluorescence artifacts were removed from the analysis, and, if
necessary, the software-generated area used for signal
detection was manually adjusted. For each microarray a
table containing the results as tab-delimited text was
exported from Genepix Pro 3.0 and imported into Excel
(Microsoft, Redmond, USA). The following criteria were
used to filter and normalize the data: 1) all data points
were removed that had a signal to background ratio of less
than three, 2) all data points that after background subtraction had lower fluorescence intensities than 1000 a.u.
were removed, 3) the average of all Cy-3 signals and all
Cy-5 signals were normalized to equity assuming that the
majority of genes are not cell cycle-regulated. Determination of cell density, average cell length and fraction of
dividing cells had revealed that the time window of cell
division in one of the three experiments had an offset of
30 minutes in comparison to the other two experiments.
While the reason for the difference is not known, the
observed offset was corrected by "re-timing" this data set.
The consequences are 1) that the five hour time point is
represented only by two values instead of three and 2)
that an eleventh time point without replicates was generated at 30 minutes, when no culture aliquot had been
removed.

After that, all 30 results tables were loaded into the DNA
microarray analysis software Genespring (Silicon Genetics, Redwood City, CA, USA). The definition file for the H.
salinarum DNA microarray was also loaded, and a time
course experiment with triplicate measurements was set

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/8/21

up. All genes were removed with signals for less than 7 out
of the 11 time points, leaving a data set of 2457 genes.
Next, all genes were removed from the results set that at
none of the 11 time points deviated from average by more
than 30% (all Cy3 to Cy5 signal intensity ratios between
0.7 and 1.3). This excluded 661 genes that with great certainty were not cell cycle-regulated and had an average
transcript level even at the time point without replicates.
1796 genes were left that had the potential to be cell cycleregulated. However, most of them had a Cy3/Cy5-signal
ratio of smaller than 0.7 or of greater than 1.3 at a single
time point. Typically, these values had a high variance,
and thus these genes were not regarded to be cell cycle-regulated. To identify cell cycle-regulated genes, the transcript level profiles of all 1796 genes were visually
inspected with Genespring, and cell cycle-regulated genes
were identified. Criteria for identification were up- or
downregulation at two or more subsequent time points
and a ratio of highest to lowest level of at least two. The
inspection was done "blindly", meaning that gene name
and function were not known as the transcription profiles
were examined. 87 cell cycle-regulated genes were discovered. Most of them showed transcription profiles that
could be grouped into one of seven clusters (compare
Results).
Northern blot analysis
Northern blot analysis was performed as described [22].
In short, RNA was isolated using the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi [41]. It was size-fractionated on formaldehyde agarose gels, transferred to nylon membranes by
downward capillary blotting [42] and immobilized by UV
crosslinking. Digoxigenin-labelled probes were constructed as described [22] using the oligonucleotides summarized in Additional file 2. Hybridization was
performed under standard stringency conditions (50%
formamide, hybridization temperatures see see Additional file 2). The membranes were washed successively in
2 × SSC, 1 × SSC, 0.5 × SSC and 0.25 × SSC. All buffers
contained 0.1% SDS. The first wash step were performed
at room temperature, the last three steps at 5°C below the
hybridization temperature. DIG detection was performed
with an enzyme linked anti-DIG antibody and the chemiluminescense substrate CDP-star according to the manufacturer's instruction (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). The
signals were visualized with X-ray films. All the probes
were specific and led to the detection of a single band.
Transcript sizes were determined with an RNA standard
(MBI Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany) and were found
to be in excellent agreement with the sizes of monocistronic transcripts of the genes (OE5212F, OE4676F,
OE1679R, OE5211F, OE4380F, OE3571F, OE1414R,
OE5049F) or with polycistronic transcripts of two or more

Identification of cluster-specific conserved sequence
motifs
The sequences from -200 nt to +200 nt around the translational start site were retrieved from the genome
sequence [23] for all genes that were presumed to have a
cell cycle-regulated promoter. If the intergenic region of
two genes was smaller than 40 nt, they were treated as a
putative operon and only the first gene was included in
the analysis. Cluster six contains only two genes in a putative operon and thus could not be analyzed. The genes of
the remaining six clusters were searched for cluster-specific conserved motifs using several programs, i.e. "Structure Logo", "ClustalW", "AlignAce", and "MEME".
Structure Logo and ClustalW allowed to retrieve the TATA
box and BRE, indicating that most transcripts are leaderless and translational and transcriptional start points
(nearly) coincide. However, they did not lead to the detection of cluster-specific conserved motifs, indicating that
regulatory elements, if they exist, do not have a fixed distance to the translational/transcriptional start point. The
analyses with AlignAce [43] and MEME (Multiple EM for
Motif Elicitations) [44,45] were performed using two
websites [46,47]. Both programs led to the detection of
conserved motifs for all six clusters. The putative regulatory motifs indeed have variable distances to the translational/transcriptional start points. The results of MEME
are summarized in Table 2.
Determination of cAMP levels
Aliquots containing 1 × 109 cells were removed from synchronized cultures at the times indicated in the Results
section. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (18
000 g, 1 min., room temperature). The pellet was quickly
resuspended in 900 μl of cold double-distilled water (a.
bid.), resulting in total lysis of the cells by osmotic shock.
100 μl of 1 N HCl was added and it was mixed thoroughly. Care was taken that cell lysis and pH downshift
were performed in less than 30 seconds. The suspension
was centrifuged (18 000 g, 5 min., 4°C), the supernatant
was quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C.

For cAMP determination, the samples were thawed on ice.
100 μl aliquots were used to quantitate the cAMP concentration with the "Direct cAMP Enzyme Immunoassay Kit"
(Assay Designs Inc., Ann Arbor, MI, USA) according to the
instructions of the manufacturer. A standard cAMP curve
and several controls were included in the kit. All samples
were determined in duplicates.
