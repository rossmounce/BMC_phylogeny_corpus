Abstract
Background: The variability within the hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome has formed the basis for
several genotyping methods and used widely for HCV genotyping worldwide.
Aim: The aim of the present study was to determine percent nucleotide identity and variability in
HCV isolates prevalent in different geographical regions of Pakistan.
Methods: Sequencing analysis of the 5'noncoding region (5'-NCR) of 100 HCV RNA-positive
patients representing all the four provinces of Pakistan were carried out using ABI PRISM 3100
Genetic Analyzer.
Results: The results showed that type 3 is the predominant genotypes circulating in Pakistan, with
an overall prevalence of 50%. Types 1 and 4 viruses were 9% and 6% respectively. The overall
nucleotide similarity among different Pakistani isolates was 92.50% ± 0.50%. Pakistani isolates from
different areas showed 7.5% ± 0.50% nucleotide variability in 5'NCR region. The percent nucleotide
identity (PNI) was 98.11% ± 0.50% within Pakistani type 1 sequences, 98.10% ± 0.60% for type 3
sequences, and 99.80% ± 0.20% for type 4 sequences. The PNI between different genotypes was
93.90% ± 0.20% for type 1 and type 3, 94.80% ± 0.12% for type 1 and type 4, and 94.40% ± 0.22%
for type 3 and type 4.
Conclusion: Genotype 3 is the most prevalent HCV genotype in Pakistan. Minimum and maximum
percent nucleotide divergences were noted between genotype 1 and 4 and 1 and 3 respectively.

Background
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) belongs to the family Flaviviridae,
genus Hepacivirus and is responsible for the second most

common cause of viral hepatitis [1]. Presently, nearly
810% of Pakistani population [2], 2% of the USA population and 3% people worldwide are HCV carriers [3]. HCV

has a positive-sense genome of approximately 9.6 kb and
is subject to high rates of mutational changes [4]. Genetic
heterogeneity of HCV isolated from different geographical
regions was documented and at least six major genotypes
with a series of subtypes of HCV have been identified so
far [5]. The relative prevalence of these genotypes varies
among different geographic regions such as subtypes 1a,
1b, 2a, 2c and 3a account for more than 90% of the HCV
infections in North and South America, Europe, Russia,
China, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and India [6,7].
Type 4 is prevalent in Egypt, North Africa, Central Africa,
and the Middle East; type 5 has been described in South
Africa and type 6 is primarily found in Southeast Asia [8].
HCV variants studies have been made in the neighboring
countries of Pakistan including India, Thailand, Vietnam,
Indonesia and Burma and it is clear from all theses studies
that type 1, type 2, type 3, and type 6 variants are prevalent
in these areas [9-11]. From Pakistan few studies are available on the distribution of various hepatitis C virus genotypes [12,13] however; none contained information on
percent nucleotide identity among different isolates and
geographic variation in the prevalence of various HCV
genotypes. Therefore; 5'NCR sequence analysis followed
by phylogenetic analysis was used for identifying different
HCV variants, subtypes and genotypes in chronic HCV
patients belonging to different geographical regions of
Pakistan.

Methods
Patients and samples
One Hundred serum samples from chronic HCV carriers
showing HCV RNA positivity and representing the four
different areas of Pakistan such as Punjab (East), North
West Frontier Province (NWFP) (North-west), Sindh
(South-east) and Balochistan (South-west) were included
in the study. The isolates from Punjab (number of isolates
[n] = 25); NWFP (n = 25); Sindh (n = 25); or Balochistan
(n = 25); are designated as P, N, S, or B, respectively, to
identify the origin of the samples. A printed questionnaire
was completed by each participant before the blood sample was collected after written informed consent. The
study protocol was approved by the Institutional Ethical
Committee. The demographic characteristics of the
sequenced patients are shown in Table 1.

Sequencing PCR of 5'UTR region
The purified DNA was used as templates for sequencing
PCR in the Big-Dye Terminator cycle sequencing ready
reaction kit (Applied Biosystems). Samples were analyzed
on an automated sequencer (ABI PRISM 3100 genetic
analyzer; Applied Biosystems). Products were sequenced
from both strands to get consensus sequences. Placed the
reaction tubes in thermal cycler (PE 2700, ABI) and set the
volume to 20 μl. The samples were preheated at 96°C for
one minute and then run 35 cycles with the following
parameters: at 96°C for 10 seconds, 50°C for 5 seconds
and 60°C for 4 minutes.
Purifying extension sample electrophoresis
The extension products were purified using ethanol precipitation method as described in the manual. Rehydrated the pellet in 15 μl formamide and mixed well by
up/down pipetting. Kept at room temperature for 15 minutes in dark. Heat denatured at 95°C for 5 minutes in
thermal cycler and immediately put on ice for 5 minutes.
The sequenced samples with BigDye terminators were
electrophoresed on ABI PRISM 3100 instrument that is
equipped with required modules and dye set/primer files.
Phylogenetic analysis
Pakistani isolates sequenced in the present study were
aligned with the representative number of sequences for
each major genotype and subtype selected from the GenBank database with the help of the Multalign program.
Pairwise comparisons for percent nucleotide homology
and evolutionary distance were made. The accession numbers of the prototype genotype sequences used to compare
the 5' NC sequences were as follows: 1a, M62321; 1b,
D90208; 2a, D00944; 2b, D01221; 2c, D10075; 3a,
D14307; 3b, D11443; 3c, D16612; 4a, M84848; 4b,
M84845; 4c, M84862; 4d, M84832; 4e, M84828; 4f,
M84829; 5a, M84860; and 6a, M84827. The phylogenetic
analysis of HCV isolates was performed with MEGA 3.0
software [14]. Jukes-Cantor algorithms were utilized, and
phylogenetic trees were constructed by the neighbor-joining method. The reliability of different phylogenetic
groupings was evaluated by using the bootstrap-resampling test from the MEGA program (1,000 bootstrap replications).

Results
HCV RNA extraction and RT-PCR
HCV RNA was extracted from 100 μl serum sample using
Gentra (Puregene, Minneapolis, MN 55441 USA) RNA
isolation Kit according to the procedure given in the kit
protocol. cDNA was synthesized at 37°C for 50 minutes
using 1 μM of outer anti-sense primer and single tube
nested PCR was done for 285-bp 5'NCR gene as described
previously (Idrees et al. 2008). The PCR products were
analyzed on 2% agarose gel.

On the basis of phylogenetic analysis, the 100 Pakistani
isolates were classified as follows: 50% type 3, 9% type 1
and 6% type 4. Thirty five isolates still remained untypable (Fig 1). It was not possible to differentiate between
type 1b and 1c isolates further into different subtypes as
both types clustered together. In the case of the type 3 isolates, there was a clear clustering of isolates into subtypes
3a and 3b but still there were isolates that were not clustering to any of the subtypes and these may be new sub-

types. Frequency distributions of HCV genotypes were not
similar in all the four regions of the country as can be seen
in table 2. In the North-west region 60% of isolates were
not typed (Table 2).
The overall nucleotide similarity among these different
Pakistani HCV sequenced isolates was 92.50% ± 0.50%.
The percent nucleotide identity (PNI) was 98.11% ±
0.50% within Pakistani type 1 sequences, 98.10% ±
0.60% for type 3 sequences, and 99.80% ± 0.20% for type
4 sequences. The PNI between different genotypes was
93.90% ± 0.20% for type 1 and type 3, 94.80% ± 0.12%
for type 1 and type 4, and 94.40% ± 0.22% for type 3 and
type 4. There was a stretch of hypervariable region from
nt: 83 to 171 in the 5'NCR of different HCV isolates. Pakistani isolates from different areas showed 7.5% ± 0.50%
nucleotide variability in the sequenced 5'NCR region. The
comparatively conserved stretch from nt 172 to 285
showed only 3.30% ± 1.06% variation. Minimum and

maximum percent nucleotide divergences were noted
between genotype 1 and 4 and 1 and 3. The sequence data
of all the 100 sequences were submitted to GeneBank. The
Accession Numbers provided for our nucleotide
sequences by the GeneBank are from EF173931 to
EF174030.

Discussion
HCV is an RNA virus is with a high rate of genetic mutation and extensive genetic heterogeneity of HCV exists in
infected individuals as a result HCV isolates are found as
either a group of isolates with very closely related
genomes quasispecies, or distinct groups genetically
called genotypes. It is believed that the different HCV variants are relevant to epidemiological questions, vaccine
development, clinical management, therapeutic decisions
and strategies. Due to this vital importance of HCV variants, the present study was carried out to identifying different HCV genotypes from Pakistan in particular to find

Conclusion
We conclude that (i) multiple HCV genotypes are prevalent in Pakistan with genotype 3a as the predominant
HCV genotype circulating in Pakistan, (ii) 5'NCR
sequence analysis is sufficient for the routine genotyping
of isolates in clinical settings; however, sequencing is very
expensive and needs special laboratory settings, expertise
and this method is unable to detect more than one genotype if present in the patient, (iii) Minimum and maximum percent nucleotide divergences were noted between
genotype 1 and 4 and 1 and 3 respectively.

out variability among HCV isolates of the same and different genotypes. In the present study we were able to successfully sequence and classify an excellent percent of
specimens. Several findings emerged from this study. The
first finding is the observation that the direct sequencing
of amplification products provides more detailed
sequence information and could be useful in the detection of new viral types and subtypes. Further, it is clear
from the results of the present study that direct sequencing of the 5'UTR fragment allows good discrimination
among the HCV major types. Due to the high degree of
conservation found within 5' NCR this approach is not
able to completely differentiate between all subtypes.
It is further clear from the findings of the present study
that in Pakistan, HCV genotypes show differing distributions in different geographic regions. HCV genotypes 1, 3
and 4 have been detected with genotype 3 being most frequently detected. Although genotype 4 is found almost
exclusively in Middle East and western countries [15] this
genotype is uncommon in our country. Unexpectedly
genotype 4 was seen very rare in Balochistan that is
attached to Iran in the South-west where genotype 4 is the
second major type existing in that area [16]. Another
important finding is the observation of the absence of
genotype 2 in all the four different regions of the country
though not surprising as from neighbor countries like
India and Iran genotype 2 is reported very rare [7,16].
Next important finding of the present study is the isolation of many type 3 variants from Pakistan. The occurrence of many variants is not surprising because such type
of variants have also been reported from neighboring
countries particularly from India. The possibility of identifying more and more variants cannot be ruled out in the
present situation of high prevalence of hepatitis C in this
country. For this purpose, a study representing larger
numbers of isolates from all provinces and community is
required to generate countrywide data on HCV genotyping and variants.
