Abstract
Background: G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent a family of well-characterized drug targets with
significant therapeutic value. Phylogenetic classifications may help to understand the characteristics of individual
GPCRs and their subtypes. Previous phylogenetic classifications were all based on the sequences of receptors, adding
only minor information about the ligand binding properties of the receptors. In this work, we compare a sequencebased classification of receptors to a ligand-based classification of the same group of receptors, and evaluate the
potential to use sequence relatedness as a predictor for ligand interactions thus aiding the quest for ligands of orphan
receptors.
Results: We present a classification of GPCRs that is purely based on their ligands, complementing sequence-based
phylogenetic classifications of these receptors. Targets were hierarchically classified into phylogenetic trees, for both
sequence space and ligand (substructure) space. The overall organization of the sequence-based tree and
substructure-based tree was similar; in particular, the adenosine receptors cluster together as well as most peptide
receptor subtypes (e.g. opioid, somatostatin) and adrenoceptor subtypes. In ligand space, the prostanoid and
cannabinoid receptors are more distant from the other targets, whereas the tachykinin receptors, the oxytocin
receptor, and serotonin receptors are closer to the other targets, which is indicative for ligand promiscuity. In 93% of
the receptors studied, de-orphanization of a simulated orphan receptor using the ligands of related receptors
performed better than random (AUC > 0.5) and for 35% of receptors de-orphanization performance was good (AUC >
0.7).
Conclusions: We constructed a phylogenetic classification of GPCRs that is solely based on the ligands of these
receptors. The similarities and differences with traditional sequence-based classifications were investigated: our ligandbased classification uncovers relationships among GPCRs that are not apparent from the sequence-based
classification. This will shed light on potential cross-reactivity of GPCR ligands and will aid the design of new ligands
with the desired activity profiles. In addition, we linked the ligand-based classification with a ligand-focused sequencebased classification described in literature and proved the potential of this method for de-orphanization of GPCRs.

tors that consist of seven transmembrane (TM) helices.
These receptors are activated by a variety of external
stimuli, including light, ions, small molecules, lipids, and
proteins; moreover, the majority of therapeutic drugs act
on GPCRs [2]. Because of the limited number of target
crystal structures [3-6], GPCR drug design relies largely
on ligand-based approaches [7] such as property-based

methods [8], pharmacophore models [9], and substructure methods [10]. These methods do not require any
knowledge about the target protein; however, combining
them with target information often increases their potential. The resulting so-called 'chemogenomics' approaches
thus involve both ligand-based and target-based aspects
[11]. They do not focus on a single group of ligands and
one individual target, but rather on groups of ligands
against groups of targets. The central idea is that similar
targets have similar ligands [12,13]. Therefore, relationships between targets from the sequence side can be
exploited to search for novel receptor ligands on the
chemical structure side.
Traditionally, the GPCR superfamily has been classified
based on sequence homology of the receptors. Kolakowski grouped all seven transmembrane (7-TM) proteins into classes A to F for receptors proven to bind Gproteins and class O for the other 7-TM proteins [14].
Class A receptors resemble rhodopsin and form the largest cluster. Later, Fredriksson et al. proposed a more elaborate classification for known and predicted human
GPCRs [1]. Surgand et al. presented a sequence-based
phylogenetic classification of GPCRs viewed from a
ligand perspective [15]. By selecting residues pointing
inwards into the generic binding pocket of GPCRs, the
authors assembled a set of 30 residues most likely to be
accessible for ligand binding. Based on these residues,
phylogenetic clustering was performed. Although only a
subset of residues was used, the classification was similar
to classifications based on the full sequence. Applications
of a grouping such as proposed by Surgand et al. constitute ligand design for related receptors, as well as deorphanization of GPCRs [15]. However, the study by Surgant et al. is somewhat limited by the scarcity of structural protein data where the identification of binding site
residues was solely based on the structure of bovine rhodopsin. It could not yet take into account recent advances
that yielded three pharmacologically relevant X-ray crystal structures, namely those of the human β2 and turkey
β1 adrenoceptors, as well as of the human adenosine A2A
receptor [3,5,6,16]. Building further on Surgand's work,
Gloriam et al. proposed an extended set of ligand-accessible residues, derived from visual inspection of the newly
available X-ray GPCR crystal structures, from supporting
mutagenesis data and from the evaluation of previously
established residue sets [17]. The resulting set of 44 residues was then applied to cluster class A GPCRs into a
phylogenetic tree, which reflected similarities in binding
site of the receptors.
Complementary to these sequence-based classifications are the ligand-based classifications of GPCRs.
Approaches that use ligand similarity measures for target
classification have been previously described [18,19].
Keiser et al. related targets by pair-wise comparison of

their ligands [20]. From a set of 65 k ligands, a network
was constructed connecting almost all 246 targets
through sequential linkage. From this, previously
unknown antagonism of methadone on the muscarinic
M3 receptor and of emetine on the α2-adrenoceptor was
identified.
While sequence-based similarity relies on comparison
of the residues at certain positions in the sequence, there
is no unambiguously defined method to measure ligandbased similarity. One way of defining ligand similarity is
to consider the overlap of substructures in the molecules.
Frequent substructure mining is a method for finding the
most common substructures in a set of molecules [2123]. It evaluates all possible substructures, not only discrete fragments that are present in the molecules; it is
therefore an exhaustive approach, resulting in a more
complete view on the structural features in the set.
In this study, we employ frequent substructure mining
to determine the similarity between groups of ligands in a
thorough and unbiased manner. This substructural similarity is then used for classification of GPCRs according
to relatedness of substructure profiles of their ligands.
The substructure-based classification of GPCRs visualizes relatedness of receptors in the form of a phylogenetic
tree, which is then compared to the sequence-based phylogenetic classifications of GPCRs. The differences in tree
organization are examined with methods that visualize
changes in target position. Taken together, we present a
(GPCR) classification from the small molecule (ligand)
perspective, which facilitates analysis of target similarities
and differences in ligand-binding behavior. In addition,
we explore the potential of our ligand-based classification
in receptor de-orphanization, i.e. the prediction of new
ligands for orphan receptors.

Results and Discussion
Sequence-based classification

Three types of sequence-based phylogenetic trees were
built, namely: one tree that was based on the full 7-TM
sequence, one tree employing 30 residues described by
Surgand et al. [15], and one tree which was based on the
set of 44 residues described by Gloriam et al. [17]. Note
that the three sequence-based trees presented here are
different from those published in the referenced original
work [1,15,17], since in the current study orphan receptors, receptors with a low number of ligands, and singleton receptors were left out. Singleton receptors are
receptors that are the only (available) member in their
respective subfamily. Due to the chemogenomic nature of
this study, we focus on the phylogenetic tree based on the
set of Gloriam et al. since it represents the ligand perspective best; this set is referenced as the GSK set [17].
The two other trees are provided for reference purposes

domain and selected residues. The tree that was built
based on the multiple sequence alignment of the GSK set
is shown in Figure 1. The GPCR subtypes in this tree are
grouped as branches in the tree according to subfamily
and target since it resembles the sequence-based phylogenetic tree on which GPCR classification is based [1].
For instance, the opioid receptor subtypes δ, κ, μ, and
NOP cluster together, as well as the α- and β-adrenocep-

tor subtypes. The fact that clustering follows the receptor
classification is expected since the classification of
GPCRs was based on sequence similarity [24,25]. Four
clusters are clearly defined in the tree: the aminergic
receptors, the adenosine receptors, the prostanoid receptors, and the peptide-binding receptors.

Ligand-based classification

The ligand-based receptor classification, which we will
compare to the sequence-based classification, is provided
in Figure 2. Subfamilies in this tree are more scattered;
however, most subfamilies cluster together. For instance,
except for the two purinergic receptors (P2Y1 and P2Y12)
and the two glycoprotein hormone receptors (FSH and
LH), all other receptors represented by only two sub-

types, such as the melatonin or the leukotriene B4 receptors, are clustered together. The adenosine receptors A1
(ADORA1), A2A (ADORA2A), A2B (ADORA2B), and A3
(ADORA3) group together, indicating overlap in ligand
profiles. This may imply that ligands for these receptor
subtypes are non-selective, such as the adenosine receptor antagonists caffeine and theophylline. Additionally,
receptor selectivity may vary with relatively small

by Gloriam et al. [17] were used. red - receptor with aminergic ligands; pink - peptide ligands; green - lipid ligands; dark blue - purinergic P2Y ligands;

changes in ligand structure: an 8-cycloalkyl substituent
on theophylline confers A1 receptor selectivity, whereas a
phenylstyryl substituent on the same position in caffeine
renders these compounds selective for the A2A receptor.
The purinergic receptor P2Y12 is found near the adenosine receptors owing to the purine core typical for ligands
of both these subfamilies. In agreement with the ligand
selectivity reported for the α1-, α2-, and β-adrenoceptor
subfamilies, these receptors form three distinct clusters
[26]; furthermore, the α1B and α1D receptors are the closest in the distance matrix. The muscarinic acetylcholine
receptors M1, M3, M4, and M5 (CHRM1/3/4/5, in Figure
2) cluster together as one group, supporting the low subtype selectivity of muscarinic antagonists [27]. However,
the acetylcholine receptor M2 is found more distant from
this cluster. This indicates the presence of distinct chemical classes in the ligand set of the M2 receptor, which may
be the result of inclusion of allosteric ligands. For
instance, gallamine is an allosteric modulator of the muscarinic M2 receptor [28] that is also present in the GLIDA
database [29], classified as an M2 antagonist. In general,
the remaining aminergic receptors (serotonergic, dopaminergic, histaminergic and cholinergic) are more scattered throughout the substructure tree. This means that
targets share ligands or ligand substructures among subfamilies/subtypes, which is in line with the high level of
polypharmacology observed for these aminergic GPCRs
[30]. For instance, the serotonin receptor 5-HT1A clusters
together with the D2 dopamine receptor, which fits with
reports on antipsychotic compounds combining dopamine D2 receptor antagonism and serotonin 5-HT1A
receptor agonism [31,32]. Structurally similar ligands
may act on diverse targets, for instance, when ligands
have a GPCR-privileged structure at their core [33,34].
The grouping of the eight prostanoid receptors (Figure 2)
indicates similarity in substructure profiles of the ligands.
This is based on the fact that most prostanoid receptor
ligands are direct derivatives of the endogenous ligands
[35,36], the so-called eicosanoids. These ligands are
highly similar, all consisting of large aliphatic, lipophilic
alkyl chains. The presence of the leukotriene and cannabinoid receptors in this lipid cluster may seem strange at
first. Leukotrienes are however also eicosanoids, which
clarifies the position of the leukotriene B4 and cysteinylleukotriene receptors in this cluster [37,38]. In addition,
arachidonic acid is the common precursor for eicosanoids and two derivatives of arachidonic acid, anandamide and 2-arachidonylglycerol, both of which are
endogenous ligands ('endocannabinoids') of the cannabinoid receptors.
The relationship between target clustering in the substructure tree (Figure 2) and ligand promiscuity suggests

Page 5 of 12

that the substructure tree may be used to identify possible side effects on receptors that are close neighbors in
this tree. For instance, off-target activity of ligands can be
identified. If inspection reveals a ligand to bind to receptor(s) that are phylogenetically related to the target of
interest, a more detailed experimental follow-up with
respect to receptor selectivity would be worthwhile.
Tree comparison

Visual comparison of the sequence tree (Figure 1) with
the substructure tree (Figure 2) reveals that the overall
phylogenetic organization is similar. For instance, with
the exclusion of the glycoprotein, P2Y, angiotensin, and
bradykinin receptors, all other receptors represented by
two subtypes occur in pairs in both the ligand tree and
the sequence tree. This is also true for receptors with
three subtypes present in the dataset, e.g. the three members of the α1, the α2, and the β1 adrenoceptors, as well as
the bombesin receptors. Exceptions to this rule are the
neuropeptide Y and vasopressin receptors. In addition,
the prostanoid receptors largely group together in both
trees, as do most of the aminergic receptors.
The clear distinction between the two dopamine receptor types, i.e. D1 and D5 (D1-like) versus D2, D3, and D4
(D2-like), exists both in the sequence-based classification
and ligand-based classification. This is in agreement with
a previous study [39] and also known from drugs on the
market such as the benzazepines that favor D1-like over
D2-like dopamine receptors. Similarly, antipsychotics
such as chlorpromazine have a higher affinity for the D2like subtypes than D1-like receptors [40].
The fact that many clusters arise in both trees indicates
that the receptors in these clusters have similar sequences
and similar ligands, that is, ligands with substantially
overlapping substructure sets. However, there are also
receptor targets for which this is clearly not the case. The
(qualitative) similarities and differences among sequence
and substructure trees are discussed in the following. A
delta-delta plot was constructed to compare how pairs of
receptors change. This plot, provided in Figure 3 (and
described in detail in the Materials and Methods section),
visualizes how receptor distances deviate between the
sequence-based tree and the ligand-based classification
of receptors. In sequence space, receptor distances indicate the (dis)similarly between protein sequences, while
in ligand space, receptor distances reflect the overlap in
structural features found in ligands for these receptors.
For each receptor, the mean distance to all other receptors is plotted. From the delta-delta plot, it becomes
apparent that the prostanoid receptors and P2Y1 receptor
are on average the most distant receptors from the rest of
the classes. The distances of the purine P2Y1 receptor, the
prostanoid FP receptor, and leukotriene receptor CysLT2

Functional convergence denotes how proteins that differ
in sequence may fulfill the same protein function. The
protein sequence of GPCR subtypes will be similar in
parts that are involved in the endogenous ligand recognition but may be different in other parts, for instance those
parts that play a role in recognition of other, exogenous,
ligands (e.g. synthetic drugs). These may therefore have a
different selectivity profile compared to the endogenous
ligand.

Average distance - Substructures

Figure 3 Delta-delta plot visualization of receptor distances in sequence and substructure space. The delta-delta plot visualizes how
target distances differ between sequence-based classification (GSK set,
y-axis) and substructure-based classification (x-axis). The average distance towards the other targets is plotted for sequence and substructure space. A few targets are highlighted in the plot to serve as
examples. These are marked by a black dot and a label that denotes the
gene symbol. Targets that are, on average, more distant from the rest
are plotted further away from the origin; targets plotted above the diagonal are more distant in sequence space, while targets plotted below the diagonal are more distant in substructure space. For example,
the FSH receptor (FSHR) is positioned relatively far from the origin and
above the diagonal. This indicates that this receptor is, in general, more
distant from the other receptors, most prominent in sequence space.

towards the other classes are all larger in substructure
space than in sequence space, implicating that overall
their ligands show little resemblance with ligands of the
other GPCRs. In contrast, for most aminergic receptors,
e.g. for the α2B-adrenoceptors and the 5-HT2B serotonin
receptor in Figure 3, distances are smaller in substructure
space compared to sequence space. This, again, corresponds with the high polypharmacology found for aminergic ligands, such as for most atypical antipsychotics
[41], with clozapine as a prominent example [42]. With
the exception of a few targets (FSH, LH), the distribution
of targets in the delta-delta plot is more scattered along
the x-axis (substructure space) than the y-axis (sequence
space). This may be a reflection of the evolutionary relationship between sequences, which results in coverage of
a small region of the overall sequence space. The ligands
for these targets do not have such a direct relationship
and thus cover a broader range in overall substructure
space.
The difference between ligand-based and target-based
classifications may be due to convergent evolution [43].

To validate how well our method performed as a chemogenomics method, i.e. how well it connects sequence space
with small molecule space and how applicable the relationship is in practice, we conducted a 'virtual de-orphanization exercise'. For each receptor in the dataset, we
pretended not to know any of its ligands by excluding
them from the datasets (we 'orphanized' the receptor in
this particular run of the protocol). We next predicted its
ligands by considering a model derived from the closest
neighbors of the receptor in sequence space (we
attempted to 'de-orphanize' the receptor whose ligands
we omitted from the study in the previous step). For this
calculation, the distance matrix for the GSK residue set
was used. The cumulative number of correctly identified
ligands of every receptor is plotted against the number of
closest neighbors (sequences) included to find these
ligands. The (relative) area under the curve (AUC) and
shape of the curve are measures of the performance of
our method. In 93% of the studied receptors, de-orphanization of the pretended orphan receptor using the ligands
of related receptors performed better than random (AUC
> 0.5) and for 35% of receptors de-orphanization performance was good (AUC > 0.7). All AUC plots could be
divided into four categories according to curve shape and
AUC (the complete set of plotted scores is available as
additional material in Additional file 2 - Plotted scores for
the leave-one-out validation). Typical examples of the
four categories are given in Figure 4. The first category is
most abundant and consists of curves with a convex
shape and an AUC above 0.5, marking good performance.
An example of this category is the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1 (CHRM1 in Figure 4) with an AUC of
0.7990. Curves of the second category display a gradual
rise that is approximately equal to the diagonal of the
plot. These plots have an AUC near 0.5, indicating performance that is equal to random prediction. An example is
the plot of the angiotensin receptor AT1 (AGTR1 in Figure 4) with an AUC of 0.5120. Curves of the third category perform worse than random and are characterized
by a concave shape and an AUC below 0.5. Clearly the
worst example is the P2Y1 purinoceptor with an AUC
value of 0.0857 (P2RY1 in Figure 4). In contrast to the
first three categories, curves of the fourth category do not

Performance plots for the following receptors are provided (from left to right and from top to bottom): CHRM1 - muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1 (first category); AGTR1 - angiotensin receptor AT1 (second category); P2RY1 - P2Y1 purinoceptor (third category); BRS3 - bombesin receptor BB3 (fourth category). These examples are discussed in the text. The full set of plotted scores is provided in Additional file 2 - Plotted scores for
the leave-one-out validation. For each plot, receptors are ordered along the x-axis (labeled "Number of included receptors") in order of increasing distance in sequence space to the receptor under study. On the y-axis (labeled "Ligands identified"), the cumulative number of retrieved ligands is depicted, normalized linearly to the interval [0;1]. The red curve indicates the number of active ligands that are retrieved when including all (closest)
receptors that are listed along the x-axis up to that point. For example, the plot of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1 (CHRM1) displays a steeply
rising curve near the origin, indicating that many of its ligands are retrieved using a small number of closest receptors. The blue diagonal illustrates
recovery of ligands when performance is equal to random prediction. The relative area under the curve (AUC) of the red curve is stated at the bottom
of each plot. An AUC above 0.5 indicates good performance, while poor performance is indicated by an AUC of 0.5 or below.

have a clear AUC range. This category consists of curves
that are divided into several discrete parts of alternating
rises and plateaus, as shown in the plot of bombesin
receptor BB3 (BRS3 in Figure 4), with an AUC of 0.8145.
Performance varies from good (BRS3) to worse than random, depending on the value of the AUC. An example of
such a plot with an AUC value below 0.5 is the FSH
receptor (not shown, see: Additional file 2 - Plotted scores
for the leave-one-out validation) with an AUC of 0.4428.
The steep rises are caused by a few receptors identifying

the majority of ligands. Some of these curves are steeply
rising at the start, which suggests that part of its ligand
set could be readily identified even though this is not
reflected in the AUC. The poor performance concerning
the P2Y1 receptor is probably due to the nature of its
ligands: this set consists of a small number of highly similar ligands that all possess a phosphate group, a feature
not found in other ligands in the database. The number of
features (substructures) shared with ligands of this receptor and other receptors is therefore small. Interestingly,

van der Horst et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11:316
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/316

the adenosine A1 and A3 receptors, which are also purinergic, identify most (28 out of 42) of the P2Y1 ligands.
However, in sequence space these receptors are at great
distance (at positions 91 and 92, respectively).
Overall, our method proves useful for receptor deorphanization, since for 93% of receptors studied de-ophanization performed better than random selection (AUC
> 0.5) and for 35% of receptors de-orphanization performed well (AUC > 0.7).
Limitations of the work

In the present study, some targets were excluded due to
insufficient availability of ligand data in the source databases. The absence of a receptor may influence the order
of other receptors in the trees. Scarcity of ligand data is
reflected in the substructure profiles, thereby influencing
the correlations among receptors. The issue of data (in)
completeness and its effect on interaction networks was
recently discussed by Mestres et al. [44]. Using three
datasets of increasing complexity (more connections)
that linked ligands to targets based on full chemical identity, the authors showed that an increase in the number of
connections rapidly leads to shifts in connection patterns.
However, our study linked targets based on overlap in
substructures; as a consequence sharing of substructures
rather than of ligands is sufficient for targets to be identified as related. Bender et al. and Keiser et al. already
showed that overlapping ligands are not necessary to predict whether targets are close in ligand space [19,20]. In
addition, our method employs an exhaustive approach to
analyze the structural features of ligands. Frequent substructure mining considers all possible substructures that
occur in the ligands and is therefore unbiased, i.e. all possible substructures were evaluated, not only those intuitive to chemists, such as functional groups, ring systems
(e.g. a phenyl ring), and linkers [45]. However, in the present study less 'obvious' substructures such as ethyl or
isobutyl are also considered [21]. For a complete discussion on substructure generation and evaluation, see ref.
[46]. Our method is not limited to GPCRs alone; it is easily extended to other protein families for analysis of the
differences between subfamily phylogenies, given that
sufficient ligand information is available. For instance, it
can be applied to the realm of enzymes to complement
other chemogenomics analyses [47].

Conclusions
In this work, we presented a ligand-based phylogenetic
classification that complements the well-established
sequence-based classification of proteins, and applied our
method to classification of GPCRs. This alternate view
may contribute to our understanding of GPCR classification since it reveals relationships that are unnoticed with
conventional phylogeny. Targets were analyzed based on

Page 8 of 12

the substructure profiles of their ligands using an unbiased approach. The overall organization of the sequence
tree and the substructure tree was similar; however, substantial differences were also discovered. In the substructure tree, several clusters of subtypes were identified. For
instance, it was found that the adenosine receptors group
together, and that certain GPCR subfamilies that do not
share sequence homology cluster because of ligand similarity. Thus, receptor similarities that signal for potential
off-target effects, such as for the serotonergic receptors,
are readily identified. In addition, combined with
sequence-based classification, the ligand-based classification presented has proven potential (93% of receptors
with AUC > 0.5 and 35% with AUC > 0.7) for de-orphanization of receptors.

Methods
Datasets
Ligands

Ligands for human GPCRs were collected from three
publicly available data sources: the StARLITe database, as
made available by ChEBI (EMBL-EBI) as part of the
ChEMBL database [48], GLIDA [29], and KiDB [49].
ChEMBL consists of a collection of more than 500,000
small molecules annotated with activity. Here, only activity values measured directly from binding studies were
included. Compounds with Ki, IC50, or EC values below
10 μM were considered active. GLIDA provides biological information on GPCRs (sequences) and chemical
information about ligand structures. It has links to several external databases, GPCRDB [25], UniProt [50], PubChem [51], and DrugBank [52]. A reported affinity in one
of these source databases classifies a compound as active,
independent of the reported binding affinity. Ligands are
annotated with an activity type, namely: full agonist, partial agonist, agonist, antagonist or inverse agonist. In the
present study, we focused only on binding affinity and not
on the activity type. This allowed us to merge the set with
the rest of the data. KiDB provides information on drugs
and molecular compounds that interact with GPCRs, ion
channels, transporters, and enzymes. The entries in KiDB
are annotated with ligand, Ki value, radiolabeled ligand,
receptor name, source & tissue, species, and PubMed link
to the publication(s). Our dataset consisted of ligands
from all three sources, by selecting human GPCR ligands
with a molecular weight between 50 and 700 Da. Only
targets that had 20 or more ligands listed were used. In
this study, we focused on class A (rhodopsin-like) GPCRs
since the majority of targets are from class A and only a
minor part from class C; combining both classes would
have negatively affected homogeneity of the phylogenetic
trees, thereby hampering comparison. For the same reason, we removed two singleton targets (targets that are
the only member in a subfamily), the gonadotrophin-

releasing hormone receptor and the ghrelin receptor. The
final set consisted of 102 targets (provided in Table 1 of
Additional file 3 - List of GPCRs used in this study) with
37350 unique ligands in total.
Sequences

The multiple sequence alignment of (specific residues of )
the 7-TM domain was obtained from GPCRDB [25,53].
Only human receptors that were non-olfactory and not
orphan were used.
Tree generation
Frequent Substructure Mining

For the ligands of each receptor, the most frequently
occurring substructures were determined. This was
accomplished by using the frequent subgraph-mining
algorithm [54], which finds all frequent substructures in a
set of molecular graphs [23]. For a description and a
quantitative comparison of recent substructure mining
algorithms, see [55]. Briefly, starting from the smallest
substructure, namely the single atoms, the algorithm
finds the number of molecules in which the substructure
occurs. If this occurrence is above a user-defined minimum, the minimum support value, the substructure is
stored. Stored substructures are stepwise extended, and
tested in a systematic manner, with the aim of testing all
possible substructures that have at least one of the stored
substructures as their basis. The algorithm seeks ways to
test only those substructures that actually occur in the
set, and that have a frequency above the set minimum.
An important concept of frequent substructure mining is
the a priori principle, originating from frequent item set
mining [56]. Algorithms based on the a priori principle
exploit that the frequency of a substructure will be equal
or lower than the frequency of the substructures it contains. Therefore, whenever the occurrence of a substructure is below the minimum support, all extensions of that
substructure are discarded.
Structures were represented as labeled graphs with a
special type for aromatic bonds. In this study, the minimum support value was set to 30% of the number of
ligands in each activity set. At this value, the algorithm
provided a large group of substructures while still being
computationally feasible to work with. In addition,
molecular structures were sorted in ascending order
according to the number of bonds. This allowed the algorithm to prune scarce, complicated substructures that
consisted of a large number of bonds, thereby reducing
memory requirements. If the set of generated substructures is disproportionately large (more than 1000 times
larger) compared to the majority of the other classes, the
generated substructures are discarded except for those
that also occur in other classes. This step was performed
in order to prevent single targets from dominating the
analysis. Since in practice most classes generated sets of

Page 9 of 12

less than 1000 substructures, a cut-off of 1 M substructures was used. Substructures with molecular weight
below 50 Dalton were discarded. The frequent substructures of all classes were merged into one set, removing
any duplicates. For all substructures in this set, the frequency in each subfamily was determined. To calculate
the correlation between two targets, we used the substructure frequencies as features for that target. A correlation matrix was constructed by calculating the Pearson
correlation coefficient for each pair of targets. Finally, a
distance matrix was constructed by subtracting the values of the correlation matrix from unity and normalizing
the results linearly to the interval [0;1].
Phylogenetic Trees

To study receptor organization, receptors were clustered
into a phylogenetic tree using the Neighbor-Joining (NJ)
method (Neighbor from the PHYLIP package [57]). This
method infers phylogenies from the pair-wise distances
between receptors. Phylogenetic trees built from distance
matrices facilitate tree comparison across domains. In
addition, NJ clusters each domain equally well since it
does not involve an 'evolutionary clock', a concept rooted
in evolutionary biology. Two distance matrices represented the similarities of the receptors: according to the
frequent substructures of their ligands and the 7-TM
domain sequence alignment, both were visualized as a
phylogenetic tree, with receptors as leaves of the tree.
The number of branches between two leaves in the tree
grows with dissimilarity of these two leaves.
The protein distances between the aligned sequences
were calculated with Protdist from the PHYLIP package
version 3.6. using the Jones-Taylor-Thornton matrix
(default) [57]. Both the sequence-based and ligand-based
phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbor.exe program from the PHYLIP package. Tree construction might be influenced by the order in which
targets are provided to the tree constructor. To minimize
the influence on the resulting phylogenetic tree, target
input order was randomized 10 times and 10 new trees
were generated. From these, a consensus tree was built.
MEGA4 [58] was used for editing the layout of the trees
and for visualization. Trees were rooted on the midpoints, that is, a root is placed at the mid-point of the longest distance between two taxa of the unrooted tree. Taxa
were arranged for balanced shape and trees were visualized as circular trees showing only topology, i.e. branch
lengths do not reflect evolutionary distance in a quantitative manner.
Tree comparison

For the comparison of trees, several methods and visualizations are available; however, there is not a single definitive measure for tree difference. To visualize how the

van der Horst et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11:316
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/316

receptor positions change between two trees we
employed a delta-delta plot.
Delta-Delta plots

The delta-delta plot reveals how receptor locations
behave globally with respect to the median of all receptors. It was used to visualize the differences in location of
each receptor in sequence space and in substructure
space. This plot is an adaptation from the delta-delta plot
in Garr et al. [59]. It is a new way of tree comparison,
which visualizes the differences among trees graphically,
as opposed to the sole calculation of a numerical distance
between two trees which is not trivial to interpret. For
each receptor, the mean distance of that receptor to all
other receptors was calculated. This value was plotted in
a scatter plot, with each axis representing the mean distance of the respective node in one of the trees. The interpretation of this plot is as follows. Along both axes,
receptors plotted far from the origin are, on average,
more distant from the rest of the group, while receptors
plotted close to the origin were closer to the rest of receptors. Receptors plotted near the diagonal do not change
much in their mean distance to other receptors when
going from one tree to the other (since they are close to
the X = Y diagonal). Receptors plotted above or below the
diagonal have different average distance to the other
receptors between trees. For instance, consider a deltadelta plot that plots a substructure tree along the x-axis
and a sequence tree along the y-axis. If a receptor is plotted above the diagonal, the mean distance of that receptor
to the other receptors is larger in the sequence tree than
the substructure tree; for receptors plotted below the
diagonal, the opposite is true.
Validation
Leave-one-out validation

This experiment is repeated for every receptor (the
'orphan receptor') by temporarily removing ligands of this
receptor from the dataset and predicting the position of
molecules of this class in the substructure tree. A molecule from the left-out class is a hit when it is predicted to
belong to one of the closest classes in sequence space.
The closest classes in sequence space are found using the
distance matrix from the multiple sequence alignment.
Prediction of the class of a molecule is based on the
Euclidean distance in substructure space. This distance is
calculated as follows: for each substructure, the square of
the difference between the relative frequency in a class
and the molecule is calculated. The relative frequency of
a substructure in a molecule is either 0 for absence, or 1
for presence of the substructure. The square root of the
sum of all squared differences is the Euclidean distance
between a molecule and a class. The area under the curve
(AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plot
served as a quality measure of the predictions for a class.

Page 10 of 12

Instead of repeating the substructure mining for every
left-out class, a lookup table of substructure occurrence
was used. This table related all generated substructures
with all molecules in which they occurred. Substructures
that had a frequency just above the support threshold in
the left-out class were not considered when analysis was
performed for molecules of this class.

Additional file 2 Plotted scores for the leave-one-out validation. Plotted scores for the leave-one-out validation. The complete set of plotted
scores of identified ligands per number of closest neighbors (sequences).
For each plot, receptors are ordered along the x-axis (labeled "Number of
included receptors") in order of increasing distance in sequence space to
the receptor under study. The y-axis (labeled "Ligands identified") indicates
the cumulative number of retrieved ligands, normalized linearly to the
interval [0;1]. The red curve indicates the number of active ligands that are
retrieved when including all (closest) receptors that are listed along the xaxis up to that point. More specifically, the number of correctly predicted
ligands is plotted against the number of closely related receptors on which
the prediction was based. For example, the plot of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1 (CHRM1, third row, third plot from the left) displays a
steeply rising curve near the origin, indicating that many of its ligands are
retrieved using a small number of closest receptors. The blue diagonal illustrates recovery of ligands when performance is equal to random prediction.
The relative area under the curve (AUC) of the red curve is stated at the bottom of each plot. An AUC above 0.5 indicates good performance, while
poor performance is indicated by an AUC of 0.5 or below. The plots are
sorted according to decreasing (relative) AUC.
