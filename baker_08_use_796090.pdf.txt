Abstract
Background: Single-stranded RNA viruses, infectious to the European honeybee, Apis mellifera L.
are known to reside at low levels in colonies, with typically no apparent signs of infection observed
in the honeybees. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) of regions of the RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase (RdRp) is often used to diagnose their presence in apiaries and also to classify the type
of virus detected.
Results: Analysis of RdRp conserved domains was undertaken on members of the newly defined
order, the Picornavirales; focusing in particular on the amino acid residues and motifs known to be
conserved. Consensus sequences were compiled using partial and complete honeybee virus
sequences published to date. Certain members within the iflaviruses, deformed wing virus (DWV),
Kakugo virus (KV) and Varroa destructor virus (VDV); and the dicistroviruses, acute bee paralysis
virus (ABPV), Israeli paralysis virus (IAPV) and Kashmir bee virus (KBV), shared greater than 98%
and 92% homology across the RdRp conserved domains, respectively.
Conclusion: RdRp was validated as a suitable taxonomic marker for the assignment of members
of the order Picornavirales, with the potential for use independent of other genetic or phenotypic
markers. Despite the current use of the RdRp as a genetic marker for the detection of specific
honeybee viruses, we provide overwhelming evidence that care should be taken with the primer
set design. We demonstrated that DWV, VDV and KV, or ABPV, IAPV and KBV, respectively are
all recent descendents or variants of each other, meaning caution should be applied when assigning
presence or absence to any of these viruses when using current RdRp primer sets. Moreover, it is
more likely that some primer sets (regardless of what gene is used) are too specific and thus are
underestimating the diversity of honeybee viruses.

Background
Honeybee populations are known to be infected by
numerous viruses that reside in colonies yet show no
apparent signs of infection [1]. These viruses are often
thought to be transmitted by the parasitic mite, Varroa

destructor, a parasite commonly detected in apiaries [2].
Evidence strongly suggests that when the colony is compromised, for example when infested with V. destructor,
virus-associated symptoms are observed, including
deformed wings and paralysis [2]. Over 18 singlePage 1 of 10

stranded positive sense 'picorna-like' RNA viruses have
now been characterised as infectious to the European
honeybee, Apis mellifera L [1]. Morphologically, these
viruses are similar, exhibiting isometric-shaped protein
capsids of approximately 30 nm in diameter [3-5]. They
also share similarities within their genome sequences,
particularly within the helicase, protease and polymerase
domains of the replicase polyprotein and also with the
order of these 3 domains [6]. The newly defined order
Picornavirales, often referred to as the Picorna-like superfamily, encompasses the families Picornaviridae, Dicistroviridae, Comoviridae, Marnaviridae and the Sequiviridae,
and the currently unassigned genera, the Iflavirus, Cheravirus, and Sadwavirus [6]. Honeybee viruses of the order
Picornavirales include the deformed wing virus (DWV),
acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV), Israeli acute paralysis
virus (IAPV), chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV), sacbrood
virus (SBV), black queen cell virus (BQCV), Kashmir bee
virus (KBV) and the recently identified Kakugo virus (KV).
CBPV remains unassigned, while SBV has been classified
as a member of the genus Iflavirus and BQCV, KBV and
ABPV have been assigned to the family Dicistroviridae
[7,8]. DWV and KV are considered to also be members of
the genus Iflavirus, however have not yet been formally
classified [9]. In addition to the honeybee viruses, a single-stranded RNA virus replicating within V. destructor
mites, VDV, has now been identified [10]. The VDV
genome has now been sequenced and has been shown to
be highly similar to DWV and KV, and is therefore tentatively assigned to the Iflavirus genus [10].
The use of RT-PCR to detect the RNA viruses in honeybees
is a routinely implemented technique and is often coupled with phylogenetic analyses to investigate similarities
or differences between virus isolates. Typically, sequences
encoding capsid genes [11,12] and sequences encoding
the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene [1316] have been employed for these studies. In particular,
the RdRp is considered a good marker for studies concerning RNA virus classification and evolution, with previous
research by Koonin & Dolja [17] identifying 8 conserved
domains within the RdRp gene of the positive sense single-stranded RNA viruses [6]. The identified domains are
considered to have important functions with respect to
RNA polymerase activity, with studies involving amino
acid substitutions within particular motifs of these
domains having significant impacts on the enzymatic
activity [18].
In this study, we assessed the suitability of the RdRp to not
only detect, but to differentiate between the different
picorna-like viruses found within the order Picornavirales. This is considered especially important in light of
the ever increasing entries in sequence databases of viruses
belonging to the order Picornavirales and the tentative

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/10

assignments of viruses to particular families/genera, often
based on partial sequences [19,20]. We also analyse the
validity of using the RdRp as a marker for studying viruses
infecting honeybees.

Results
Analysis of RdRp conserved domains across the order
Picornavirales
The recently defined order Picornavirales has 8 members
[6] and closer analysis of the conserved domains identified by Koonin and Dolja [17] based on a multiple
sequence alignment of 46 virus sequences was undertaken
(Table 1). Within domain I of the order Picornavirales the
Lysine (K) and Aspartic acid (D) residues in the 4th and 5th
positions are conserved across all members; the family
Dicistroviridae and the genus Iflavirus are the most variable in this domain, with only 3 and 2 conserved amino
acids respectively, and these two members were the only
two not to have the conserved motif KDE. Domain II was
highly variable, where only one amino acid, Arginine (R),
was conserved for 7 out of the 8 members, the exception
being the family Dicistroviridae, which had a potential
Lysine (K) substitution at this position for BQCV, Triatoma virus (TRV) and Himetobi P virus (HiPV), yet both
have basic amino acid properties (Table 2). In addition,
the family Picornaviridae have an insertion in this
domain that was absent in all the other members. In
domain III a deletion and a substitution of the otherwise
conserved amino acid Tryptophan (W) separated the family Picornaviridae from the others. The amino acid Glycine (G) was nonetheless found to be conserved amongst
all of the members. With the exception of the genus Ilfavirus, all members of the order Picornavirales have 2 aspartic acid (D) residues and 2 conserved sites of amino acids
with aromatic side chains in domain IV. The genus Iflavirus had a substitution of either Glycine (G) or Serine (S)
at the 2nd conserved aspartate site (Table 2). Domain V is
the most conserved domain with the consensus sequences
PSGxxxTxxxN occurring in 5 out of 8 members. All the 8
members possess the GDD motif in domain VI, while
YGDD (in domain VI) and FLKR motif (in domain VII)
were conserved in 87.5% and 75% of the members,
respectively. Domain VIII was the least conserved with the
Sadwavirus, Cheravirus, Sequiviridae and Marnaviridae
having the shared PLxxxxI motif.
Analysis of RdRp conserved domains amongst the
honeybee viruses
With the exception of CBPV (which remains unassigned),
the honeybee viruses analysed in this study have been
assigned or tentatively assigned (these will be discussed as
assigned viruses for the purpose of this paper) to 2 separate groups within the order Picornavirales, the family
Dicistroviridae and the genus Iflavirus. Analysis of the consensus sequences for these 3 main groupings across all 8

domains was undertaken on 139 virus sequences (Table
3), and showed conserved amino acids present in the family Dicistroviridae that are absent in the genus Iflavirus,
and vice versa (Table 4). CBPV, which has only had the
RdRp gene partially sequenced, is distinct to the others,
sharing little similarity, with the exception of 4 amino
acids in domain V and the GDD motif in domain VI.

Family Dicistroviridae
In general, BQCV shared more conserved motifs with
other members within the family Dicistroviridae, but it
also had the most amino acid substitutions across all
domains (Table 4). The amino acid sequences of both
domains I and IV are identical in the 3 viruses, KBV, IAPV
and ABPV, yet changes were noted at the nucleotide level
(data not shown). Within domain II, KBV, ABPV and IAPV
are identical except for 1 amino acid substitution in ABPV,
where Alanine (A) is substituted for Threonine (T) (Table

4). The end of domain V and the start of domain VI show
the greatest region of amino acid variability in these 3
viruses, with each of the viruses having 2 unique amino
acid residues each (Table 4). At the nucleotide level, ABPV
differed to KBV and IAPV, and within the ABPV sequences
analysed, domain II was least conserved with 8 nucleotide
substitutions, whereas no substitutions were detected in
domain I, 0 in domain III and 3 in domain IV (data not
shown).
Genus Iflavirus
SBV shows the most amino acid differences in this group,
with DWV, VDV and KV showing a high level of similarity.

These 3 viruses are identical at the amino acid level in
domains I, II, III, VI and VII (Table 4). Only 2 amino acid
substitutions are evident in VDV, in domains V and VII,
where Glutamine (Q) is substituted for Lysine (L) and Isoleucine (I) is substituted for Valine (V) respectively.
Nucleotide substitutions are, however, detected in all 8
domains both within the DWV sequences and also with
the KV and VDV sequences. VDV was different from the
two identical nucleotide sequences of KV and DWV by 1
nucleotide substitution in domain I (data not shown).
Domain II was more variable for DWV with nucleotide
substitutions at 8 sites (35 isolates were analysed), and 4
within KV and 11 with VDV (data not shown).

Overall, domains I & II were the most conserved amongst
all the honeybee viruses analysed and thus the boundary
that separated the members of the family Dicistroviridae
and genus Iflavirus was less clear. Domains III to VIII
revealed clearer separation between these two members
(Table 4). In fact the conservation of amino acids within
domains V and VI is in agreement with CBPV belonging to
a different genus if not family.
The consensus sequences for the 8 domains of the honey
bee viruses were force joined to form a contiguous
sequence and were aligned against each other to compare
the sequences (Table 5). The iflaviruses, DWV, VDV and
KV share greater than 98% sequence identity, with KV and
DWV being identical, however, shared only 51% and 52%
homology with the other iflavirus, SBV. Similarities
between the aforementioned iflaviruses and the dicistroviruses, ABPV, IAPV, KBV and BQCV, were less than 43%.
Within the dicistroviruses, IAPV and KBV shared the highest sequence similarity of 96%, with IAPV and ABPV sharing 92% similarity and KBV and ABPV sharing 93%.
Similarities of these 3 viruses with BQCV were considerably lower, ranging from 47–51 % (Table 5).

Discussion
Validation of RdRp as a genetic marker for the order
Picornavirales
The order Picornavirales share a common virion structure,
single-stranded positive sense RNA genome, 3' poly A tail
and a 5' VPg [6]. The viruses of this order encode a type I
RdRp domain within the replicase polyprotein that exhibits 8 conserved motifs [17]. Comparative analysis of the
RdRp (Table 2) revealed that certain amino acid residues
or motifs are conserved amongst all of the domains of this
order, with the yGDDn motif located in domain VI seemingly the most conserved. In addition, it is common where
an amino acid is substituted in a particular group for it to
retain similar properties to the substituted amino acid.
The FLKR motif in domain VII is one such example, with
the Phenylalanine (F) in the family Dicistroviridae and
genus Iflavirus often being substituted to Tyrosine (Y),
which shares the property of being an aromatic amino

acid. Hence, the comparison of the consensus amino acid
sequence for each group supports the current classification of these viruses together within this order and suggests that their RdRp share similar properties or activities
(Table 2). The highly conserved GDD motif is thought to
have an imperative role in RdRp activity, with the 1st
aspartate residue in the motif being shown to be involved
in the coordination of magnesium ions during nucleotidyltransfer catalysis [21]. If this amino acid is substituted,
viral replication and RNA synthesis has been shown to
cease [18].
The analysis of the RdRp of the order Picornavirales shows
that there is enough sequence variability for the subdivision of this order into the 8 families and genera, as previously assigned based on features described by Christian et
al. [6] (Table 2). Briefly, these characteristic features
include the conserved order of core non-structural protein
domains, a polyprotein gene expression strategy processed exclusively by virus proteinases, a pseudo-T3 isocahedral symmetry of capsids, a 3–4 kDa VPg with few
characteristic features, a hydrophobic domain between
the helicase and VPg, a 3C-like Cysteine proteinase, a type
II helicase domain and type I polymerase domain [6].
Unique amino acids or motifs can be identified in the
RdRp of particular families or genera, meaning that they
can be differentiated. For example, the genus Sequivirus
has a conserved KDERR motif in domain I, whereas the
genus Cheravirus has a KDEKT motif (Table 2). The families Picornaviridae, Dicistroviridae and genus Iflavirus
show the highest degree of variability and could potentially be subdivided further within their respective group
as there appears to be obvious subdivisions that could be
applied (data not shown). One potential subdivision
could be within the family Dicistroviridae, with KBV,
ABPV, CrPV, TSV and DCV forming a genus due to their
high similarity within this family. Future analyses could
address whether these viruses differ in any other way to
the other members of the family Dicistroviridae in their
RdRp enzymology or with respect to their epidemiology,
transmission or persistence. Much more information is
being brought to light regarding the importance of the
motifs in the structure and functioning of RdRp [22]. As
RdRp is universal in the positive sense RNA viruses it
makes it a key focus for the understanding of viral replication, evolution and pathogenesis. Further structural and
biochemical studies will provide more clues regarding
RdRp, which, based on these alignments, can be tentatively predicted in all other viruses sharing these motifs.
Validation of RdRp for the differentiation of honeybee
viruses
With the RdRp being confirmed as a good marker for
resolving hierarchical structures within the order Picornavirales, sequences of honeybee viruses deposited in Gen-

Bank were investigated further to assess the application of
RdRp for differentiating between these viruses. Within the
family Dicistroviridae, BQCV shows consistent amino
acid differences with KBV, IAPV and ABPV across all 8
domains, yet is more closely related to these viruses than
any other honeybee virus (Table 4). KBV, IAPV and ABPV,
however, are much more similar, being identical at the
amino acid level in domains I and IV (Table 4). KBV and
IAPV are the most similar, sharing 96% amino acid
sequence identity (Table 5). The amino acid differences
between these three viruses are not at key conserved sites
which are considered to be important in RdRp structure
and function. This high amino acid similarity is also mirrored (at a lesser extent) in the nucleotide sequences, with
de Miranda et al. [7] reporting a 70% nucleotide identity
between ABPV and KBV. Serologically and biologically,
KBV, IAPV and ABPV are very similar, with BQCV being
the more different in this family [8], and this is also
reflected in the RdRp gene. The symptoms associated with
BQCV are not observed in association with any of the
other dicistroviruses, with the queen brood being seen to
darken and die, the queen cell walls turning black, and
being additionally known to be transmitted by the parasite, Nosema apis [5]. ABPV, IAPV and KBV have less easily
defined symptoms, such as trembling, crawling bees, or
indeed no overt symptoms at all, making them difficult to
diagnose in the field. Sequence analysis of the RdRp suggests they are highly related and it is possible that they
diverged very recently and should be considered as variants of each other.
The RdRp lacks a proof reading function and hence is
more prone to errors, leading to frequent nucleotide
changes and subsequently, amino acid substitutions
[23,24]. The amino acid sequence is the important factor
in the functionality of this enzyme playing pivotal roles in
maintaining the integral conformation, and coordinating
the discrimination of sugars and coordinating ions. The
conserved motifs observed within these honeybee viruses
are obviously important in the RdRp activity, otherwise
their persistence within the RdRp would have not have
occurred. Nucleotide substitutions within this gene have
transpired [25] yet have not translated into significant
changes in the amino acid composition, implying the core
functionality has remained the same for ABPV, IAPV and
KBV. IAPV has recently been implicated as responsible for
colony collapse disorder (CCD), where colonies, particularly in America, have been seen to suddenly die without
any detection of virus-like symptoms [26]. Here we propose that IAPV is also a variant of the ABPV and KBV, having evolved as a more aggressive pathogen. Certainly,
there are divergent regions of sequences present within
the genomes of these viruses, with de Miranda et al. [7]
describing regions of only 33% homology between ABPV
and KBV, such as regions between the helicase and 3C-

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/10

protease domains and the non-structural polyprotein.
RNA-based viral genomes are more likely to mutate due to
the error prone nature of RdRp, however certain regions
do not have a strong selection pressure to retain a
sequence, which is why these regions are more likely to be
variable. Subsequently, these regions are less appropriate
when used solely for inferring virus taxonomy.
At this point it is also important to re-evaluate the data
obtained from the particular primer sets employed in RTPCR for the routine detection of the viruses in colonies.
Analysis of primers employed by Tentcheva et al. [16] and
Baker & Schroeder [25], for the detection of ABPV suggests
that they may have also amplified IAPV. Only 4 out of 21
nucleotides (mainly at the 5' end of the oligonucleotide)
in the forward primer were different to the IAPV sequence,
and only 2 out of 20 differed in the reverse primer. Due to
the imprecise nature in preparing PCRs, i.e. different reagents, quality of samples, different thermocyclers etc., and
even when stringent PCR conditions are used, the detection of IAPV with this primer set cannot be discounted.
Hence, when interpreting results on the occurrence and
distribution of these viruses care must be taken as functional variants may either be amplified or missed.
Sequencing negates this problem, to an extent, however, it
would need to be performed on every sample analysed to
confirm the exact variant detected. Other studies have utilised the structural polyprotein for the confirmation of
presence or absence of honeybee viruses in colonies
[11,27], however, depending on the purpose of the study
it may actually be more appropriate to design primers
within the RdRp gene, ensuring most, if not all variants,
are captured.
A similar scenario was detected in the genus Iflavirus with
VDV, KV and DWV sharing a greater than 98 % homology
across the 8 domains and only 2 amino acid substitutions
(Tables 4 &5). Again in this genus, a lower homology was
identified with the other member of the group, SBV, with
51/52% homology, confirming their division as separate
virus 'species' (Table 5). As with BQCV, in the family
Dicistroviridae, SBV is very different in observed symptoms in comparison to the symptoms seen in the other
Apis mellifera infecting iflaviruses, supporting the suggestion that it may be more divergent. The implications of
the strong homology and amino acid conservation
amongst the iflaviruses, VDV, KV and DWV, are that they
are highly similar and most likely have similar replication
efficiencies. Consequently, we propose these viruses share
a recent common ancestor. Certainly this concept has
already been proposed by Lanzi et al. [9] where, unlike in
ABPV and KBV [7], none of these potential variants show
geographical distinction, and the phylogenetic analysis of
the RdRp shows no divisions that correlate to different
regions [9]. Our results are consistent with those of a

Page 8 of 10

Virology Journal 2008, 5:10

recent study on DWV strains detected across the world,
where a low nucleotide sequence divergence is also
observed in the helicase and structural genes of this virus
[28]. No clear geographical pattern of distribution was
identified based on the phylogenetic analysis of these
genes either, suggesting that other genes within these
viruses are also highly conserved. In this study by Berenyi
et al. [28], DWV was indeed separated into a separate
clade from VDV and KV, yet this grouping was supported
by bootstrap values of less that 70, questioning the robustness of this separation. We therefore support the variant
hypothesis of Lanzi et al. [9] as other observations, such
as both VDV and DWV replicating within the Varroa mite
(KV has not yet been tested) [10], also lead to the same
conclusion. However, differences arise when addressing
the symptoms involved with these virus infections, with
KV and DWV manifesting different symptoms within the
honeybees. KV has been show to cause aggressiveness in
the bees [29], being localised in the brain tissue, and with
DWV causing deformed, crumpled wings and not being
localised to specific body part [30]. The pathological effect
VDV has on the mites and also the honeybees has yet to
be deciphered, however, from genomic analysis by Ongus
et al [10], VDV has been confirmed as being highly similar
to DWV and KV, having an 84% sequence identity. It is
suggested that variations existing in other parts of the
genomes of these viruses have contributed to their pathological characteristics, for example the specificity of KV to
brain tissues, and the ability of DWV and VDV to replicate
in mites. This virus may have nucleotide changes in the
structural polyprotein that have transpired to amino acid
changes and consequently induced an alteration of host
tissue recognition. Indeed, this has been observed in the
canine paravirus (CPV), a virus infectious to cats, minks,
racoons and dogs, yet the ancestor virus, feline panleukopenia virus (FPV), cannot infect dogs. It was resolved that
2 amino acid residue changes in the capsid protein of FPV,
resulted in the expansion of this virus host range, creating
the CPV variant, hence it is feasible that a similar scenario
may have emerged in the honeybee viruses [31].
In addition, the detection of these iflaviruses through RTPCR can be unreliable, depending on the purpose of the
study, as the likelihood of detecting all the known variants
is high. DWV-specific primers used by Tentcheva et al.
[16] and Baker & Schroeder [25] had only 1 mismatch in
the forward primer with KV and no mismatches in the
reverse; therefore it is plausible that this variant was also
detected. A recent study by Chen et al. [14] also highlights
this aspect when they used quantitative PCR to investigate
DWV prevalence, with the forward primer containing no
mismatches for KV and 1 for VDV, the reverse having no
mismatches for KV and 2 mismatches for VDV, and the
probe have 0 mismatches for KV and 1 for VDV respectively. Thus, this should be considered when interpreting

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/10

their results, as it is possible that they were detecting different or even missing other variants in different tissues
and/or bee types.
To date, only a region of the RdRp of CBPV has been
sequenced and based on traditional classification requirements, it is difficult to assign a family/genus for this virus.
Based on our analysis CBPV is clearly a member of the
order Picornavirales, however, it appears that it is very
divergent from the other characterised honeybee viruses
and thus should be assigned as the type strain for a new
genus and/or family.

Conclusion
We have validated the use of the RdRp as a taxonomic
marker for the classification of the order Picornavirales
and, to an extent, for the viruses infecting the honeybee.
The evidence supports the assignment of DWV, VDV and
KV as variants of the same virus, with it also being proposed that ABPV, IAPV and KBV, are also variants of the
same virus. We suggest that care should be taken when
using molecular tools to ascertain whether certain viruses
are present in any given sample and thus will affect the
prediction of cause and effect. The data presented here
provides further foundations for understanding the ecology of these viruses and the interactions they have with
their hosts, therefore being useful for beekeeping practises. The results potentially also provide further information on the evolution of these honeybee viruses in the
context of the order Picornavirales.

Methods
Validation of RdRp oligonucleotide probes
Multiple amino acid and nucleotide sequences of the
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) protein for the
single-stranded RNA viruses were selected from NCBI
(Tables 1 &3) and were aligned using ClustalW using the
default settings [32]. Conserved regions spanning motifs I
to VIII of the RdRp, as defined by Koonin & Dolja [17],
were used for analysing the suitability of this gene as a
marker. Published oligonucleotides were analysed against
this alignment to assess suitability to differentiate
between inter- and intra-species variations within the
Picornavirales
