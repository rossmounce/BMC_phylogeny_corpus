Abstract
Background: In many eukaryotes, microRNAs (miRNAs) bind to complementary sites in the 3’-untranslated regions
(3’-UTRs) of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and regulate their expression at the stage of translation. Recent
studies have revealed that many miRNAs are evolutionarily conserved; however, the evolution of their target genes
has yet to be systematically characterized. We sought to elucidate a set of conserved miRNA/target-gene pairs and
to analyse the mechanism underlying miRNA-mediated gene regulation in the early stage of bilaterian evolution.
Results: Initially, we extracted five evolutionarily conserved miRNAs (let-7, miR-1, miR-124, miR-125/lin-4, and miR-34)
among five diverse bilaterian animals. Subsequently, we designed a procedure to predict evolutionarily conserved
miRNA/target-gene pairs by introducing orthologous gene information. As a result, we extracted 31 orthologous
miRNA/target-gene pairs that were conserved among at least four diverse bilaterian animals; the prediction set
showed prominent enrichment of orthologous miRNA/target-gene pairs that were verified experimentally.
Approximately 84% of the target genes were regulated by three miRNAs (let-7, miR-1, and miR-124) and their
function was classified mainly into the following categories: development, muscle formation, cell adhesion, and
gene regulation. We used a reporter gene assay to experimentally verify the downregulation of six candidate pairs
(out of six tested pairs) in HeLa cells.
Conclusions: The application of our new method enables the identification of 31 miRNA/target-gene pairs that
were expected to have been regulated from the era of the common bilaterian ancestor. The downregulation of all
six candidate pairs suggests that orthologous information contributed to the elucidation of the primordial set of
genes that has been regulated by miRNAs; it was also an efficient tool for the elimination of false positives from
the predicted candidates. In conclusion, our study identified potentially important miRNA-target pairs that were
evolutionarily conserved throughout diverse bilaterian animals and that may provide new insights into early-stage
miRNA functions.

Background
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short (18-25 nucleotides) non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression
posttranscriptionally. Their regulatory potential relies
heavily on the recognition of binding sites that are located
mainly in the 3’-untranslated regions (3’-UTRs) of target
messenger RNAs (mRNAs) [1]. Currently, numerous miRNAs with diverse sequences are being characterized in a

wide range of species [2], suggesting that this small RNA
molecule has a major effect on phylogeny. The importance
of miRNAs is also suggested from recent research demonstrating that miRNA-guided gene regulation is involved in
diverse biological functions, such as cell differentiation,
development, carcinogenesis, and tumour suppression
[3-6]. For example, phylogenetically conserved miRNAs (e.
g., let-7, miR-1, miR-124, and miR-125) are involved in cell
differentiation and development [7-10]. In this case, let-7
regulates the expression of RAS proteins known as critical
oncogene products [11]. Moreover, miR-34, another evolutionarily conserved miRNA, is a direct downregulator of

p53 and is involved in a genetic pathway that promotes
cell-cycle progression [12].
In recent years, more than 700 miRNAs have been identified in humans [13], and this number is increasing. In
a recent report by Friedman et al., the expression of a
large number of target genes is predicted to be regulated
by miRNAs [14]; however, relatively few of these have
been verified experimentally. To overcome this problem,
a series of computational methods has been developed
to predict a large number of miRNA targets; e.g., TargetScan [14], RNAhybrid [15], MicroTar [16], PITA
[17], miRanda [18], and PicTar [19]. Nevertheless, these
computational approaches often provide numerous target candidates with a large number of false positives
because of the weak complementarity between miRNAs
and 3’-UTRs [20]. Recently, a phylogenetic profiling
approach has been applied to overcome this limitation.
For example, studies of the evolution of orthologous target sites have provided insights into the prediction of
efficient miRNA targets [21]. As for miRNAs, many
miRNA families are found among various bilaterian animals, suggesting that several miRNAs and their target
genes may have co-evolved; however, these features
have yet to be systematically characterized.
In this study, we hypothesized that the core regulatory
relationship between miRNAs and their target genes
were conserved throughout the evolution of bilaterian
animals. In addition, by predicting these relationships, we
sought to elucidate the core function of miRNAs in the
primitive gene-regulatory network of the common bilaterian ancestor. Accordingly, we focused on five miRNAs
(let-7, miR-1, miR-124, miR-125/lin-4, and miR-34) that
are conserved among bilaterian species (Homo sapiens
(H. sapiens), Mus musculus (M. musculus), Gallus gallus
(G. gallus), Drosophila melanogaster (D. melanogaster),
and Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans)) and designed a
procedure to extract conserved miRNA/target-gene pairs.
We extracted evolutionarily conserved miRNA/targetgene pairs based on hybridization patterns and orthologous information. In addition, we experimentally verified
several candidate pairs to support our methodology. Our
results suggest a functional role of three major miRNAs
(let-7, miR-1, and miR-124) that regulated genes related
to development, muscle formation, and cell adhesion.
These results suggest a new role for the core function of
miRNAs in the primitive gene-regulatory network of the
common bilaterian ancestor.

Results and Discussion
Extraction of evolutionarily conserved miRNAs among
five bilaterian animals

To extract conserved miRNA/target-gene pairs, we
chose five model species (H. sapiens, M. musculus, G.

Page 2 of 13

gallus, D. melanogaster, and C. elegans) among bilaterian
animals, for which there exists a vast array of data on
both miRNAs and mRNAs [13]. Previously, several
important features were described to classify miRNAs
into families. It is well known that the seed sequence
(the 5’ side of the miRNA sequence) is important for
interaction with the target mRNAs [22]. Many miRNA
target prediction software programs were developed
using the features of seed sequences [14-19]. Moreover,
several features have been proposed to identify conserved miRNA families, such as conservation of the
mature miRNA sequence (features of the earliest
miRNA classification in miRBase) [23] and information
on the phylogenetic relationship among miRNAs [24].
By focusing on these features, we proposed the following
criteria for extracting well-conserved miRNA families
among five species: (1) complete seed sequence matching, (2) mature miRNA sequence identity exceeding
75%, and (3) high conservation among miRNA families,
considering the phylogenetic relationship among miRNAs (category I) [24]. Consequently, from 2,404 mature
miRNA sequences, we extracted five miRNA families
(let-7, miR-1, miR-124, miR-125/lin-4, and miR-34) conserved evolutionarily among the five bilaterian animals
(Table 1). The sequence identity among most of the
conserved miRNA families was over 80%. In particular,
the sequences of let-7 and miR-1 family members
showed very high mature miRNA sequence identity
(exceeding 90%) among all five bilaterian species, which
suggests that a strong selective pressure exists for the
nucleotide sequence. Huang et al. described the extraction of 15 conserved miRNA families among six bilaterian animals (H. sapiens, M. musculus, G. gallus, D. rerio,
D. melanogaster, and C. elegans) based on their original
classification method [24], which included our five
miRNA families. In this manuscript, we devised more
stringent criteria based on nucleotide conservation to
extract highly conserved miRNA families. Nematostella
vectensis and Amphimedon queenslandica, which
diverged before the emergence of bilaterian animals,
reportedly express various types of miRNAs [25]; however, none of these miRNAs are sequentially similar to
the five evolutionarily conserved miRNA families found
in the current study (data not shown), which suggests
that these evolutionarily conserved miRNAs appeared
after the divergence of bilaterian animals or were lost in
N. vectensis and A. queenslandica.
Filtering and enrichment of the evolutionarily conserved
miRNA/target-gene pairs

To extract genes targeted through evolution by the five
conserved miRNAs, we designed a procedure that comprised three screening steps (Figure 1 and Table 2). In
step 1, we extracted potential target genes based on

optimal free-energy information with a requirement of
complete seed-sequence-matching using the RNAhybrid
software [15], which predicts potential binding sites of
short RNAs among target sequences. For this purpose,
the optimal free energy was determined beforehand to
efficiently cover experimentally validated miRNA/targetgene pairs. We calculated the free energy of 139 experimentally validated miRNA/target-gene pairs with a complete match of seed sequence, as assessed using
RNAhybrid; subsequently, we defined the optimal free
energy as < -17 kcal/mole of potential miRNA/targetgene pairs (data not shown). The evaluation of targetgene extraction during each step was carried out using
an index termed “Enrichment” (see Methods section).
As a result, in step 1, the number of potential targetgene candidates decreased from 357,430 to 153,387,
with an enrichment index of 1.8. This prediction set
contained 112 of the 145 experimentally validated target-gene pairs.
In step 2, we considered the 3’-UTR binding pattern
of the miRNA/target mRNA. We defined four binding
parameters (i.e., number of mismatches of mRNA within
the whole miRNA sequence, number of mismatches of
miRNA within the whole miRNA sequence, number of
G-U wobble pairs within the whole miRNA sequence,
and number of G-U wobble pairs within the seed
sequence) of the hybridization pattern (Additional file 1)
for optimisation of the thresholds for each of the features used to predict reliable miRNA/mRNA pairs. The

ranges of the four binding parameters were determined
by calculating the coverage of 112 miRNA-mRNA pairs
verified experimentally and of 153,387 miRNA-mRNA
pairs predicted for each binding feature (Figure 2A-D).
Five hundred parameter combinations were plotted on a
2D graph, using “Enrichment” on the X-axis and “Ratio
of experimentally verified miRNA/mRNA” on the Y-axis
(Figure 2E). From these parameter combinations, we
defined the optimal combination of binding parameters
for efficient screening based on a maximum EC value of
184.7 (number of mismatches of mRNA within the
whole miRNA sequence: 12; number of mismatches of
miRNA within the whole miRNA sequence: 10; number
of G-U wobble pairs within the whole miRNA sequence:
4; and number of G-U wobble pairs within the seed
sequence: 0). Accordingly, the number of potential target-gene candidates was reduced from 153,387 to 28,201
and the experimentally validated target genes decreased
from 112 to 76 after introduction of the criterion of
optimal hybridization pattern (Enrichment index, 6.6)
(Table 2).
Finally, in step 3, we incorporated orthologous gene
information and extracted genes that were evolutionarily
conserved among more than four diverse bilaterian animals, including H. sapiens. As a result, the number of
predicted miRNA/target-gene pairs was minimized substantially, from 10,356 to 31, using a significantly high
Enrichment index of 25.7 (Table 2). The number of predicted miRNA/target-gene pairs was especially high for

were extracted from the five model species (H. sapiens, M. musculus, G. gallus, D. melanogaster, and C. elegans). For each miRNA, potential target
genes were predicted using the following criteria: optimal free-energy threshold and complete matching of nucleotide sequences between the
seed sequence of miRNA/mRNA duplexes (step 1), binding pattern of the 3’-UTR of miRNA/mRNA duplexes (step 2), and orthologous gene
information (step 3).

Figure 2 Parameters used for the prediction of miRNA/mRNA pairs and their coverage. To optimize the binding parameters of miRNA/
mRNA duplexes, we determined the coverage of four binding parameters (mismatch of mRNA within the whole miRNA sequence (A), mismatch
of miRNA within the whole miRNA sequence (B), G-U wobble pairs within the whole miRNA sequence (C), and G-U wobble pairs within the
seed sequence (D)). Calculation of the coverage was performed using 112 experimentally verified miRNA/mRNA pairs (orange line) and 153,387
predicted miRNA/mRNA pairs (blue line). The yellow bar indicates differences in coverage between experimentally verified and computationally
predicted miRNA/mRNA pairs. Four or five points chosen from the highest yellow bar were used as the range of each of the four binding
parameters (blue squares) used in this study. We determined parameter space using the binding patterns of the miRNA/mRNA pairs based on
four features (E). Five hundred parameter combinations were plotted on a 2D graph using “ratio of experimentally verified miRNA/mRNA” on the
Y-axis and “Enrichment” on the X-axis. Black circles (57.3% of the coverage and 3.2-fold of the Enrichment) indicate the point that corresponded
to optimized parameters for the prediction of final conserved miRNA/target pairs: 12 for the number of mismatches in the mRNA, 10 for the
number of mismatches in the miRNA, 4 for the number of G-U wobble pairs within the whole miRNA sequence, and 0 for the number of G-U
wobble pairs within the seed sequence (see Methods section).

the three miRNAs let-7 (eight targets), miR-1 (seven targets), and miR-124 (eleven targets) compared with miR125/lin-4 (three targets) and miR-34 (two targets) (Additional file 2). This suggests that let-7, miR-1, and miR124 may have played a major role in primordial miRNA
gene regulation in the common bilaterian ancestor. To
verify the significance of conserved miRNA-target gene
pairs, we performed same sequence analysis (from step
1 to step 3) against total 25 species-specific miRNAs (5
miRNAs each from 5 species) as a control experiment
supposing that these miRNAs are also conserved in
other bilaterians. For example, target prediction of hsamiR-2277, a species-specific miRNA in human was performed in all 5 species (step 1 and step 2) and conserved targets were extracted (step 3). As a result, 11
out of 25 non-conserved miRNAs did not show any
conserved miRNA-target gene pair. Furthermore, average number of the miRNA-target gene pairs of the
negative control was 2.4, which is statistically lower than
that of conserved miRNA-target gene pairs 6.2 based on
the Welch’s t-test (P < 0.05). These results support that
number of genes achieved from the prediction of conserved miRNAs target genes in this study is indeed significant. In summary, we developed a new filtering
method for extracting evolutionarily conserved miRNA/
target-gene pairs, which was used to extract 31 reliable
miRNA/target-gene pairs among the five families of
miRNAs.
We discovered that only one orthologous target gene,
calponin-3 (CNN3), was conserved completely among
the five bilaterian animals (Figure 3A). As for target
genes conserved in four species, we found, for example,
the La-related protein 4 (LARP4), ETS domain-containing protein Elk-3 (ELK3), argonaute-4 (EIF2C4), transgelin-2 (TAGLN2), and V-type proton ATPase subunit B
brain isoform (ATP6V1B2) genes (Figure 3B and Additional file 3). Of note, the same approximate position of
the predicted target site was observed in the orthologous
3’-UTR of CNN3 (120 nucleotides (nt)), LARP4 (3,100
nt), EIF2C4 (220 nt), and TAGLN2 (50 nt) among vertebrates (Figure 3 and Additional file 3). According to
Bartel et al., the distribution of miRNA target sites
within the 3’-UTR is biased near the mRNA stop codon
or poly-A tail compared with the middle portion of 3’UTR [26]. Our results show that target site distribution
varied according to the type of miRNA target gene. The
target sites on 3’-UTR of CNN3 and TAGLN2 were
biased near the stop codon, from H. sapiens to C. elegans (Figure 3A and Additional file 3). Regarding the
other candidates, we observed all types of target site distribution on 3’-UTR. A future statistical analysis of
miRNA target-site distribution among conserved
miRNA/target-gene pairs is required to substantiate this
view. With the exception of 3’-UTR of the LARP4 gene,

Page 6 of 13

most of the binding patterns of evolutionarily conserved
target sites were sequentially different, without taking
the seed region into consideration. The target-site binding patterns within 3’-UTR of the LARP4 gene were
identical between H. sapiens and M. musculus (Figure
3B), although the similarity of the two 3’-UTR
sequences was ~70% (data not shown). A recent study
reported on cooperative regulation by multiple miRNAs
[19]. Likewise, the band 4.1-like protein 4B (EPB41L4B)
gene was an orthologous target of two different types of
miRNAs: miR-1 and miR-124 (Table 3). Our analysis
suggests that multiple miRNA regulation may have
already existed in the era of ancestral bilaterian species.
Experimental validation of miRNA target genes

To validate the evolutionarily conserved miRNA/targetgene candidates, we performed transfection and luciferase assays on 6 of the 31 identified evolutionarily conserved miRNA/target-gene candidates. Four of the six
candidates (CNN3, LARP4, TAGLN2, and ATP6V1B2)
were predicted to be regulated by miR-1, while one candidate (ELK3) was predicted to be targeted by miR-124,
and the final candidate (EIF2C4) was predicted to be the
target of let-7. We used the well-established downregulation of the delta-like protein 1 precursor (DLL1) gene
by miR-34 as a positive control [22], and the LARP4/let7 pair, which was extracted up to step 2 in our analysis,
was chosen as a non-evolutionarily conserved pair. We
subcloned the 3’-UTR sequence downstream from the
Renilla luciferase gene (Figure 4A) and co-transfected
100 ng of the 3’-UTR reporter construct into HeLa cells
using 5, 20, and 60 pmol of miRNA Mimics (hsa-let-7a,
hsa-miR-1, hsa-miR-124, hsa-miR-34a, and miRIDIAN
microRNA Hairpin Inhibitor Negative Control #1) (see
Methods section). We observed the downregulation of
six out of six candidates and of the positive control
compared with the negative controls (Figure 4B, a-g).
Typical results of the reporter gene assay are shown in
Figure 4B for the indicated amounts of miRNAs (5, 20,
and 60 pmol). The downregulation of these candidates
was significant (P < 0.01), although some of these pairs
represented an inhibition of only 30% under the current
conditions. Among these candidates, TAGLN2 was previously suggested to be downregulated by miR-1, as
assessed by microarray analysis [27]. This feature was
recently confirmed using the “pulsed stable isotope
labelling with amino acids in cell culture” (pSILAC)
method and a reporter gene assay [28]. Regarding the
let-7/LARP4 combination, the expression of LARP4 was
not downregulated after let-7 transfection, which was
supported statistically (Figure 4B, h). These experimental
results suggest that our new method has the potential
for efficiently extracting reliable miRNA/target-gene
pairs and may be effective in the elucidation of the

primordial regulatory relationships between miRNAs
and their target genes during the early stage of bilaterian
evolution.
Possible regulation of evolutionarily conserved miRNA
targets in bilaterian animals

To provide further insight into the primary functions of
evolutionarily conserved miRNAs (Table 3), we next
focused on the functions of the target genes and found
that evolutionarily conserved miRNA/target genes could
be largely classified into four functional categories:
development, differentiation, muscle movement, and

gene regulation. First, we describe the function of evolutionarily conserved genes involved in development and
differentiation. The laminin subunit gamma-1 precursor
(LAMC1) gene, which was possibly regulated by miR124, is one of the major components of the basement
membrane. According to Smyth et al. [29], null mutation of LAMC1 causes embryonic lethality because of
the absence of the basement membrane and failure to
differentiate the endoderm. Among other candidates
regulated by miR-124, the expression of the leucine-rich
repeat flightless-interacting protein 2 (LRRFIP2) gene
induces an extra axis in Xenopus laevis embryos [30].

sequences of the orthologous CNN3 (A) and LARP4 (B) transcripts are shown. Predicted duplexes formed by the 3’-UTR sequences (top) and
miRNAs (bottom) are shown in dotted boxes for each potential target site. The green bar on the H. sapiens 3’-UTR sequence indicates a DNA
region used for the construction of the reporter plasmid pLuc-CNN3 (Figure 4A). See Additional file 3 for other candidates. (*) The length of the
CNN3 3’-UTR is currently registered as a little shorter than that indicated (527 nt in size) and contains the miR-1 binding site (Ensembl release
53).

Moreover, the semaphorin-6D precursor (SEMA6D)
gene, plays an important role in cardiac morphogenesis
during chick embryonic dev which was predicted as a
candidate of miR-34 targeting, elopment [31]. The lin28 gene, which regulates developmental timing in C. elegans, is reportedly controlled by lin-4, as assessed using
in vivo experiments [32]. Subsequently, the lin-28 gene
was also found to be regulated by miR-125, which is an
orthologous miRNA of lin-4, in H. sapiens and M. musculus [33]. Our prediction confirmed the regulation of
orthologous lin-28 genes by lin-4/miR-125 miRNA in H.
sapiens, M. musculus, and C. elegans and further suggested that a similar regulatory relationship was conserved in G. gallus. Interestingly, our prediction showed
that the orthologous let-7/lin-28 pair was also evolutionarily conserved among bilaterians. This feature had
been validated experimentally in H. sapiens [34]; however, in C. elegans, lin-28 is expressed in an early stage
of development, while let-7 is expressed in a later stage
of development, suggesting that regulation of lin-28 by
let-7 is subtle in C. elegans [7]. It would be of interest
to analyse the interaction of the let-7/lin-28 pair in
other species, such as M. musculus and G. gallus, to

understand whether stage-specific expression of let-7
was present in the common ancestor of bilaterian animals or if it is a trait acquired later during evolution, as
many of the evolutionarily conserved miRNA/targetgene pairs were related to an essential function involved
in differentiation and development.
Next, we focused on the tissue-specific miRNA/target
genes. Among the 30 evolutionarily conserved target
candidates, approximately one-third were expressed in a
tissue-specific manner in humans, according to the
BioGPS portal http://biogps.gnf.org. miR-1 is highly
expressed in muscle tissues [8]. Here, three candidate
genes regulated by miR-1 (i.e., TAGLN2, CNN3, and
TPM3) are also expressed in muscle tissues, according
to BioGPS. TAGLN2 is a homolog of TAGLN, which
encodes an actin-binding protein and is a diagnostic
marker of breast and colon carcinoma in humans [35].
The CNN3 gene also encodes an actin-binding protein
that represses bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling in chondrocytes, which is important for bone
formation [36]. Moreover, the TPM3 gene encodes yet
another actin-binding protein that modulates muscle
contraction. The other miRNA, miR-124, is expressed in

Figure 4 Example of the 3’-UTR reporter plasmid and experimental validation. The 3’-UTR sequences of DLL1, CNN3, LARP4, ELK3, EIF2C4,
TAGLN2, and ATP6V1B2 were subcloned into the XhoI/NotI site of the psiCHECK™-2 vector. CNN3 was chosen as representative of the eight
candidates listed above (see Methods section). (B) HeLa cells were cotransfected with each combination of 100 ng of reporter plasmid and the
indicated amounts of each miRNA (DLL1, 5 pmol of miR-34 (a); CNN3, 60 pmol of miR-1 (b); LARP4, 20 pmol of miR-1 (c); ELK3, 60 pmol of miR124 (d); EIF2C4, 60 pmol of let-7 (e), TAGLN2, 5 pmol of miR-1 (f), ATP6V1V2, 60 pmol of miR-1 (g), and LARP4, 60 pmol of let-7 (h)). Colours depict
each miRNA: miR-34 (red), miR-1 (blue), miR-124 (orange), let-7 (green), and negative control (black). The relative expression of the luciferase gene
was measured 24 h after transfection. The normalized luciferase activity of the control vector was set as 1.0. The data represent the average of

the nervous system [9]. Similarly, one of the evolutionarily conserved target candidates, the glucosamine-fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase 2 (GFPT2) gene, is
expressed in the central nervous system [37]. In addition, the annexin A7 (ANXA7) gene, which is another
candidate target of miR-124, is involved in the development of the murine brain [38]. The striking overlap
between the tissue specificity of evolutionarily conserved
miRNA and that of their target genes suggests that one
of the main functions of primordial miRNAs may have
been the regulation of genes implicated in the temporary control of the development of muscle and of the
nervous system, in a tissue-specific manner.
Finally, we found two interesting candidate genes,
EIF2C4 and LARP4, which encode translation-related
proteins. It is well accepted that miRNAs are regulators
of gene expression, mostly at the translational level [1].
EIF2C4 is also known as Argonaute 4 (AGO4). Although
the function of AGO4 is unknown, other Argonaute
protein family members are involved in the RNAinduced silencing complex (RISC), which is essential for
the miRNA or siRNA pathways. A previous microarray
analysis performed in HepG2 cells revealed that the
EIF2C4 gene was affected by let-7 [6]. In the present

study, we demonstrated for the first time the direct
downregulation of EIF2C4 by let-7, as assessed using a
reporter gene assay in HeLa cells (Figure 4B, e); therefore, we speculate that negative-feedback regulation of
EIF2C4 by let-7 exists in the miRNA pathway. It has
been reported that regulation of the AGO1 mRNA,
which is a major component of the RISC complex, in
the miRNA pathway by miR-168 controls plant development in Arabidopsis thaliana [39]. Another candidate,
LARP4, encodes a member of La-motif protein family
that controls translational efficiency [40]. We also
demonstrated the downregulation of the LARP4 gene
via miR-1 using a reporter gene assay (Figure 4B, c),
which further supports our contention that some of the
evolutionarily conserved miRNAs may play an important
role in the regulation of translation by controlling the
expression levels of translation factors and by negatively
regulating their own miRNA pathway.

Conclusions
We developed a procedure to extract potential evolutionarily conserved miRNA/target-gene pairs based on
orthologous gene information from five bilaterian animals, and efficiently extracted 31 evolutionarily

Takane et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:101
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/101

conserved miRNA/target-gene pairs from 357,430 pairs.
We experimentally validated the downregulation of six
candidate pairs (out of six tested pairs) in HeLa cells,
which suggests that our method using orthologous
information was efficient in extracting evolutionarily
conserved miRNA target-gene candidates. Our findings
reveal that miRNA target sites were conserved among
various species, and demonstrate that especially let-7-,
miR-1-, and miR-124-mediated gene regulation may
have played an important role throughout evolution, in
processes such as development, differentiation, and muscle movement. Moreover, our results indicate that
miRNA-mediated translational regulation as well as tissue-specific expression of miRNA/target-gene pairs may
have already existed in the common bilaterian ancestor.
In conclusion, our study will provide new insights into
the early stages of miRNA function.

Methods
miRNA and 3’-UTR sequence data

We downloaded 2,404 mature miRNA sequences (885
for H. sapiens, 689 for M. musculus, 520 for G. gallus,
153 for D. melanogaster, and 157 for C. elegans) from
the miRBase, version 13.0 http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/
sequences/[13]. We downloaded sequences corresponding to 3’-UTR using the Ensembl transcript ID annotation in FASTA format (40,498 transcripts for H. sapiens,
3,332 for M. musculus, 13,089 for G. gallus, 16,822 for
D. melanogaster, and 13,560 for C. elegans) from the
Ensmart database Ensembl release 53 http://www.
ensembl.org/index.html[41]. Orthologous gene information was also downloaded from the Ensmart database
Ensembl release 53. We obtained 145 experimentally
verified miRNA/target-gene pairs from TarBase Version
5.0.1 http://diana.cslab.ece.ntua.gr/tarbase/[42].
Identification of miRNAs conserved among bilaterian
animals

The 2,404 miRNA sequences were aligned using ClustalX
[43] with the following alignment parameters: gap opening,
22.50; gap extension, 0.83; and bootstrap value, 100. We
checked the conservation of 2,404 miRNA sequences to
extract evolutionarily conserved miRNAs. We defined the
conservation threshold as an “overall sequence identity >
75% with complete matching of the seed sequence (1-7, 2-8,
or 3-9 nucleotides from the miRNA’s 5’ end)"; furthermore,
we introduced information on the phylogenetic relationship
among miRNAs to extract reliably conserved miRNAs and
used highly conserved miRNA families (category I) [24].
Extraction of evolutionarily conserved miRNA/target-gene
pairs among bilaterian animals

To extract evolutionarily conserved miRNA/target-gene
pairs among bilaterian animals, we devised a three-step

Page 10 of 13

filtering approach (Figure 1). In step 1, we predicted
genes targeted by each of the five miRNAs (let-7, miR-1,
miR-124, miR-125/lin-4, and miR-34) using RNAhybrid,
which is fast and flexible software for miRNA target
prediction, with the free-energy option and the seedsequence option [15]. The RNA duplex free-energy filter
was defined as the appropriate value that led to the efficient extraction of experimentally verified miRNA/target-gene pairs. We also considered a complete match
across the seed sequence (1-7, 2-8, or 3-9 nucleotides
from the miRNA’s 5’ end), which was used as a filter by
adding the seed option of RNAhybrid.
In step 2, we used four binding parameters of the
hybridization pattern of the miRNA/mRNA duplexes.
According to a recent study, a binding rule is likely to
exist for the recognition of target mRNAs by miRNAs
[34]. Moreover, G-U wobble pairs within miRNA/
mRNA duplexes play a key role in the interaction with
target mRNAs [44]. Subsequently, potential candidates
were extracted using four binding parameters (number
of mismatches of mRNA within the whole miRNA
sequence, number of mismatches of miRNA within the
whole miRNA sequence, number of G-U wobble pairs
within the whole miRNA sequence, and number of G-U
wobble pairs within the seed sequence) of the miRNA/
mRNA duplexes (Additional file 1). We used the hybridization pattern of experimentally verified and predicted
miRNA/mRNA pairs to calculate coverage, by changing
these binding parameters one by one (28-0 for the number of mismatches of mRNA within the whole miRNA
sequence; 14-0 for the number of mismatches of
miRNA within the whole miRNA sequence; 10-0 for the
number of G-U wobble pairs within the whole miRNA
sequence; and 6-0 for the number of G-U wobble pairs
within the seed sequence) (Figure 2A-D). The range of
each of the four binding parameters was determined
based on the coverage of experimentally verified and
predicted miRNA/mRNA pairs. Parameter combinations
were then plotted on a 2D graph by calculating the
“ratio of experimentally verified miRNA/mRNA” and
“Enrichment” using the points in the four parameter
ranges (Figure 2E). The criterion “Enrichment” was
defined and calculated as the value of “ratio of experimentally verified miRNA/target-gene pairs” divided by
the “ratio of predicted miRNA/target-gene pairs”. We
obtained the most effective combination of four binding
parameters for extracting miRNA/target-gene pairs
based on the EC value. Parameter conbination with
highest EC value was selected.
In step 3, orthologous gene information was used to
extract orthologous genes targeted by the same type of
miRNA. For the retrieval of evolutionarily conserved
miRNA/target-gene pairs from various bilaterian animals, we set the orthologous gene information criteria

Takane et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:101
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/101

as orthologous genes conserved in at least four species,
each containing the miRNA target site of interest.
Expression vectors

To construct target-site reporter plasmids, each DNA

polymerase chain reaction using site-specific primers
and was inserted into the XhoI/NotI sites of the psiCHECK-2 plasmid vector (which encodes both firefly
and Renilla luciferases; Promega, Madison, WI, USA)
(Figure 4A). The oligonucleotide was designed to introduce XhoI and NotI sites at the 5’ and 3’ termini,
respectively. The resulting plasmids were termed pLucDLL1, pLuc-CNN3, pLuc-LARP4, pLuc-ELK3, pLucEIF2C4, pLuc-TAGLN2, and pLuc-ATP6V1B2, respectively. miRIDIAN™ miRNA Mimic for hsa-let-7a, hsamiR-1, hsa-miR-124, hsa-miR-34a, and negative control
(miRIDIAN microRNA Hairpin Inhibitor Negative Control #1) were purchased from Dharmacon. miRNA

Transfection and luciferase reporter assay

Transient transfection and luciferase assays were performed as described previously, with slight modifications
[22]. Briefly, HeLa cells were grown in 10% FBS in
DMEM and seeded in 24-well plates 24 h before transfection. Cells were transfected with the indicated
amounts of reporter and miRNA Mimic (100 ng of target reporter and 5, 20, and 60 pmol of miRNA Mimic)
in the presence of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA). Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured consecutively using the Dual-luciferase assay system (Promega) 24 h after transfection,
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
