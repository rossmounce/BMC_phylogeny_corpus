Abstract
Background: The intergenic spacer of the ribosomal genes in eukaryotes (IGS) contains
duplications of the core transcription promoter. The number of these duplicated promoters, as
measured by the IGS length, appears to be correlated with growth rate and development time in
several distantly related taxa. In the present study, we examined IGS length variation across a
number of species of Drosophila to determine the amount of variation in this trait across different
evolutionary time scales. Furthermore, we compared the usefulness of two methods commonly
used to determine IGS length: Southern Blot Hybridization (SB) and Polymerase Chain Reaction
(PCR).
Results: Our results show broad variation in IGS length across the genus Drosophila, but closely
related species had similar IGS lengths. Our results also suggest that PCR tends to underestimate
the true IGS size when the size is greater than 5 kb, and that this degree of underestimation is
greater as the IGS size increases.
Conclusion: Broad variation in IGS length occurs across large evolutionary divergences in the
subfamily Drosophilinae. Although average IGS length has been shown to evolve rapidly under
artificial selection, closely related taxa generally have similar average IGS lengths. Our comparison
of methods suggests that without previous knowledge of the DNA sequence of the IGS and flanking
regions, both methods be used to accurately measure IGS length.

Background
Due to the importance of ribosomes in protein synthesis,
cellular growth, and organismal development, ribosomal
genes are highly transcribed; with ribosomal RNA
accounting for nearly half of all cellular transcription and
80% of the RNA content of growing cells [reviewed by
[1,2]]. To achieve these high levels of ribosome production, eukaryotes have multiple copies of ribosomal
(r)DNA, arranged in tandem in the Nucleolus Organizer
Regions (NORs) of one or more chromosomes. In addi-

tion, eukaryotes sustain high levels of transcription per
rDNA copy [1].
The structure of the ribosomal intergenic spacer (IGS; Figure 1) appears to be important for achieving these high
transcription levels. IGS varies in length from about 2 kb
in yeast to 21 kb in mammals, and is also highly variable
among and even within individuals of the same species
[reviewed by [1]]. These length polymorphisms are
mostly due to variation in the numbers of different

internal subrepeats present in the IGS (Figure 1). In
eukaryotes, some of these repetitive regions contain duplications of the core promoter [reviewed by [1]]. These promoter duplications have been shown to enhance rDNA
transcription. For example, in Drosophila melanogaster,
activity of the rDNA promoter is directly correlated with
the number of IGS subrepeats that contain a promoter
duplication [3,4]. Selection studies also support the idea
that IGS structure is important for rDNA transcription and
consequently for growth rate. Cluster et al. [5] found a
relationship between IGS length and development time in
D. melanogaster, where lines selected for fast development

had on average, longer IGS variants (attributed to more
copies of the promoter duplication) than lines selected for
slow development. Similarly, under selection for rapid
growth rate, average IGS length increased in Daphnia pulex
[6], and after selection for high yield, the frequency of
long spacers increased in maize [7]. Furthermore, longer
spacers are associated with higher growth rates in several
species of Daphnia [8]. Although these studies suggest that
IGS length may have significant effects on life history
traits, the evolutionary significance of IGS length remains
a mystery. An initial step to understanding the evolutionary role of IGS length is to characterize its variation across

a group of related taxa that could then be used to test
hypotheses about the adaptive significance of IGS length
using the comparative method. The main goal of the
present paper is to characterize IGS length variation across
a wide range of Drosophila species (subfamily Drosophilinae) and determine the amount of variation observed
across different evolutionary time scales.
Studies of IGS length variation have commonly relied on
Southern Blot hybridization (SB) for inference of IGS
length. However, more recently, several studies have used
PCR to determine IGS length [6,8-10]. Each of these methods has advantages and disadvantages. The main disadvantage of PCR is that certain fragments (particularly the
smaller ones) may be selectively amplified, and that it
may not amplify large (> 4 kb) fragments. Thus, the
amplified products may not represent the actual size frequency distribution of the IGS. The main disadvantage of
SB is that it requires more DNA to begin with. Both methods require previous knowledge about the DNA sequence;
either for the design of primers for PCR or for the selection
of restriction digestion enzymes for Southern blot hybridization. The secondary goal of this study is to compare the
usefulness of each method in estimating IGS length across
a group of related taxa when knowledge about sequence
of IGS and flanking regions is restricted to a small subset
of the taxa under examination. Therefore, design of PCR
primers and selection of restriction enzymes is based on
this limited number of sequences.

Results
We examined IGS length variation based on Southern Blot
hybridization SB and/or PCR in 71 species of the Dro-

sophilinae representing 20 species groups in the genus
Drosophila and four other genera (Table 1). Of these, only
52 yielded PCR product. Therefore, for the remaining 19
species we were able to infer IGS length based only on SB.
Of the 52 species for which we obtained PCR product, 29
(representing 11 species groups in two subgenera of the
genus Drosophila) had a single restriction site near one of
the ends. This was the restriction digestion pattern we
expected based on the D. melanogaster map (i.e., Hae III
site No. 2; Figure 1). From the remaining 23 species, nine
did not have a restriction site within the PCR fragment;
thus SB-based inferences of IGS length in these nine species would have overestimated the true IGS length. In contrast, the remaining 14 species had more than one
restriction site within the PCR fragment. Therefore, SBbased inferences of IGS length in these 14 species would
have underestimated the true IGS length.
Repeated SB of the same DNA extracts revealed very similar patterns of IGS length variation. Similarly, repeated
PCR amplifications of the same DNA extracts revealed
similar patterns. However, in some cases, examination of
different numbers of individuals or DNA amounts of the
same species resulted in slightly different patterns of IGS
length variation. Nevertheless, the size index for each species was very similar across different numbers of individuals and different DNA amounts (results not shown).
Comparison of methods
We compared IGS size index based on SB and PCR for the
29 species for which presence of one restriction site was
confirmed (Figure 2). Average IGS length (i.e., the size
index) ranged from 3.3 kb in D. pseudoobscura to 11.6 kb

in D. paulistorum (Figure 2; Table 1). It is unlikely that the
large fragments resulted from incomplete digestion
because use of different amounts of restriction enzyme
and of DNA resulted in similar patterns (results not
shown). In most cases, the size index based on PCR was
smaller than the one inferred from SB (Figure 2; Table 1),
although in a few cases they were almost equal and in
three cases (i.e., D. eugracilis, D. parvula, and D. putrida),
the PCR-based estimates were actually larger. The difference between the size index based on SB and the one
based on PCR ranged from zero in D. pseudoobscura to 8 kb
in D. paulistorum.
To compare the results from both methods for the 29 species for which presence of the expected single restriction
site was confirmed, we performed least squares regression
analysis as implemented in JMP [11] of the following variables: (1) PCR-based IGS index on SB-based IGS index
(Figure 3a); (2) the IGS size difference between the two
methods (i.e., SB minus PCR) on SB-based IGS index (Figure 3b). Our results suggest that although in most cases
PCR-based sizes were smaller than SB-based sizes (i.e.,
most data points fell below the dashed line; Figure 3a), no

relationship exists between the IGS size index inferred
from SB and that inferred from PCR (i.e., the regression is
not significant). In other words, the difference between
the two methods is not consistent across taxa. The differences observed between the two methods can be attributed to: (1) the possibility that the Hae III site No.1
(Figure 1), which occurs upstream of the forward primer
(and thus, not within the PCR amplified product), was
lost and therefore the IGS size based on SB was overestimated; (2) measurement error; (3) differences in the
length of the sequences adjacent to the IGS that are targeted by each method (i.e., the PCR fragment is not the
same as the SB fragment; see Figure 1); or (4) the tendency
of the PCR to amplify smaller fragments. Given the highly
conserved nature of the region where Hae III site No.1 is
found, we do not expect this site to have been lost often
within Drosophila. However, loss of this restriction site is a
concern in the case of D. paulistorum due to the large difference between PCR and SB results. Although, we lack an
estimate of measurement error, our results based on multiple IGS-length estimates of the same taxon with a single
method never differed by more than 1 kb (see Table 1).
Similarly, based on the known sequence of the regions

adjacent to IGS in several Drosophila species, the expected
difference between the PCR and SB estimates should not
exceed ~200 bp. Thus, we adopt the criterion that the difference between the two methods should be greater than
1 kb (dashed line Figure 3b) for it to be regarded as a true
difference due to the method used. Based on this criterion,
in about half of the comparisons the PCR-based estimates

were smaller than SB-based estimates; most of which had
a SB-based estimate of 5 kb or more. This is further illustrated by the observation that the size difference between
the two methods increased as the size based on SB
increased (Figure 3b), suggesting that the larger the IGS
fragment, the greater the degree of underestimation based
on PCR. This relationship is still significant after removing
the results from D. paulistorum (not shown; P = 0.0019).
An alternative, explanation is that the PCR-based results
were accurate and thus the degree of overestimation by
the SB method increases as the true IGS size decreases.
This is unlikely however, because in D. melanogaster for
example, the true length of the most common variant is
known based on sequence data, and PCR-inferred IGS
lengths of this species were always smaller.
IGS length variation across the genus Drosophila
Unless otherwise noted, we discuss IGS length variation in
Drosophila based only on the 29 species for which presence of Hae III site No.2 could be confirmed and for
which no evidence of additional restriction sites within
the IGS was observed (see above). We observed broad variation in IGS length across the genus Drosophila. The IGS
size index ranged from 3.3 kb in D. pseudoobscura to 11.6
kb in D. paulistorum (Figures 2 and 4; Table 1). Even if we
exclude D. paulistorum from our interpretation (see
above), the IGS size index range is still broad, with D.
pachea (9 kb) representing the species with the largest IGS
index.
Within species groups
IGS size index variation within species groups based on SB
was lower than across the subfamily (Figure 4). For example, among the eight species examined from the melanogaster species group the largest difference between
species was 3.9 kb (i.e., D. eugracilis vs. D. varians). Similarly, among the four species from the virilis species group,
the largest difference was 3 kb (i.e., D. novamexicana vs D.
kanekoi). The largest difference among five species in the
obscura group was even smaller; 1.4 kb between D. pseudoobscura and D. affinis. The largest difference was
observed in the willistoni species group; 5.7 kb between D.
willistoni and D. paulistorum, but with the caveat that the
result for D. paulistorum may be an overestimation (see
above). The difference between D. nannoptera and D.
pachea (nannoptera group) also was relatively large; 4.1 kb.

Comparisons between more closely related species suggest that they tend to have very similar IGS indices: D. parvula (4.5 kb) vs. D. kanapiae (5.7 kb); D. novamexicana
(5.1 kb) vs. D lummei (5.6 kb); and D. persimilis (3.4 kb)
vs. D. pseudoobscura (3.3 kb). The only exception was the
comparison between D. paulistorum (11.6 kb) and D. equinoxialis (6.8 kb), but as mentioned above, the value for D.
paulistorum may be an overestimation.

Within species variation
Based on SB, all of the species except one (i.e., D. putrida)
had more than one IGS length variant (Table 1). In most
cases, the length difference between the shortest and longest IGS length variant was at least 3 kb. However, for spe-

cies in which more than one individual was used, we
cannot distinguish between intra- and inter-individual
variation. Nevertheless, we found differences among
species in the number of fragments present in species
where we examined single individuals; Drosophila robusta

and D. melanogaster had the highest number of bands per
individual (16 and 9–15, respectively), whereas D. grimshawi had only two bands and D. putrida had only one
(Table 1).
Results based on PCR only
IGS sizes based on PCR were generally smaller than IGS
sizes based on SB (Figure 2). Nevertheless, it is interesting
to point out patterns of IGS size variation in the species
for which SB could not be used due to the absence of one
or both of the Hae III restrictions sites or to the presence
of additional restriction sites in the IGS region. For the
subset of species that were examined only by PCR, the size
index ranged from 2.4 kb in D. seguyi and D. birchii, to 7.1
kb in D. mettleri (Table 1). Very close relatives or sister species tended to have similar lengths. For example, D. ananassae (4.1 kb) vs. D. pallidosa (4.3 kb); D. greeni (2.7 kb)
vs. D. seguyi (2.4 kb); and D. arizonae (4.3 kb) vs. D.
mojavensis (4.2–4.8 kb). Although these PCR-based values
may not represent the true IGS size index (see below),
they may provide a minimum estimate for IGS size.
Results based on SB only
For the remaining 19 species, we only report IGS sizes
based on SB because we were unable to obtain PCR
product. However, these results should be considered
with caution because the presence of Hae III site No. 2 or
of additional restriction sites could not be assessed. There
are several possible explanations for our inability of
obtain PCR product in these species. First, it is possible
that IGS fragments were not amplified because they were
too large (i.e., the largest fragment we were able to amplify
was 7.9 kb in D. pachea). It is important to note that
amplification of the IGS region in Drosophila is not trivial
because of the length (i.e., usually above 3 kb), and the
high degree of secondary structure present in this region
[12]. Second, the priming sites could have diverged,
although our PCR primers target highly conserved regions
of the 28S and 18S ribosomal genes. Finally, despite having tried a large variety of amplification conditions, we
may not have found the appropriate ones for that particular species.

Based on the SB results, the largest IGS size index observed
was 16.6 kb in D. acanthoptera. One of its relatives in the
nannoptera group, D. wassermani, also had a large IGS size
index, 13.1 kb. Although it is possible that these results
based on SB are an overestimation of IGS size (i.e., loss of
a restriction site), it is interesting to note that D. pachea,
another member of the nannoptera group (for which we
were able to confirm the presence of Hae III site No.2),
also had a relatively large IGS size of 9 kb. Interestingly,
the most basal member of this group, D. nannoptera, had
a much smaller IGS index of 4.9 kb. These SB-based
results also suggest broad variation in the melanogaster

species group, with D. bicornuta having the largest IGS
index of 10.8 kb.

Discussion
Our study showed that in about half of the taxa examined
IGS length estimates based on PCR were smaller than
those estimated with SB, particularly when IGS sizes
exceeded 5 kb, suggesting that PCR tends to underestimate the true IGS length because of selective amplification of smaller fragments. A comparison with results from
previous studies suggests this. For example, studies of IGS
length variation in D. melanogaster based on SB show that
this species has many fragments larger than 5 kb [5,13]. In
contrast, the studies that used PCR to infer IGS length in
this species found that amplified fragments were always
smaller than 4 kb [9,10]. Therefore, SB seems to be the
most appropriate method for IGS length inference. However, knowledge about the sequence is required, or at least
the presence of the appropriate restriction sites on the
ends of the fragment of interest should be confirmed. For
example, in the present study, we were able to confirm the
presence of one of these restriction sites (i.e., Hae III site
No. 2), by PCR amplification of IGS, followed by restriction digestion of PCR products. Nevertheless, the PCR
fragment ideally should span the region that contains
both restriction sites, because in at least one case (i.e., D.
paulistorum), we suspect the other restriction site may have
been lost. Unfortunately, we were unable to obtain amplification with PCR primers that spanned the region that
contained both restriction sites.
IGS size variation
Our study revealed that IGS size index variation among
species of the subfamily Drosophilinae is broader than
previously reported [5,13-17]: from 3.3 kb in D. pseudoobscura to 9 kb in D. pachea and possibly 11.6 kb in D. paulistorum. Considering that D. pseudoobscura diverged from
D. pachea, 40–63 million years ago, and from D. paulistorum 35–62 million years ago (Figure 4), the large IGS
length differences are not surprising; particularly in light
of the observation that average IGS length has been demonstrated to change rapidly after artificial selection in D.
melanogaster [i.e., 24 generations to shift the average size
from 5.54 to 5.8 kb and 15 generations to shift the average
size from 5.54 to 5.12 kb; [5]].

Despite the speed at which IGS has been shown to evolve
under selection, comparisons between very closely related
taxa, including sister species pairs, suggest that they tend
to have very similar IGS indices. For example, the close
relatives, D. parvula and D. kanapiae differ from each other
by 1.2 kb; and D. novamexicana and D. lummei [i.e., ~6
million-year-divergence; [18]] differ by 500 bp. An even
more closely related species pair [i.e., ~ 0.85 million-yeardivergence; [19]], D. persimilis and D. pseudoobscura, differ

only by 100 bp. The only exception was the comparison
between D. paulistorum and D. equinoxialis, who differ by
4.8 kb, but as mentioned above, the value for D. paulistorum may be an overestimation. Although the PCR-based
results should be interpreted with caution, they may offer
additional insight regarding patterns of IGS length across
closely related taxa. For example, D. ananassae differs from
its close relative D. pallidosa by 200 bp; D. greeni differs
from D. seguyi by 300 bp; and D. lini differs from D. kikkawai (based on PCR) by 800 bp. Finally, the IGS index of
D. arizonae is within the range of values reported for two
populations of its sister species D. mojavensis, from which
it diverged approximately 1–1.2 million years ago
[20,21].
Comparisons of more distantly related taxa, even within
the same species group show less clear patterns. For example, the four members of the montium subgroup of the
melanogaster species group examined in this study (i.e., D.
kikkawai, D. auraria, D. parvula, and D. kanapiae) differ
from each other by a maximum of 1.2 kb. On the other
hand, based on our results and the ones of Coen et al.
[14], IGS size index ranges from 3.6 to 6 kb among eight
members of the melanogaster subgroup (D. melanogaster,
D. mauritiana, D. simulans, D. erecta, D. yakuba, D. teissieri,
D. orena, and D. eugracilis) another subgroup within the
melanogaster species group. Similarly, based on our results
and the ones from Rae et al. [17], IGS size index ranges
from 4.2 to 8.0 kb across nine members of the virilis species group; thus, the largest IGS index observed in this
group almost doubles the smallest one. A large difference
(i.e., 4.1 kb) is also observed between D. pachea and D.
nannoptera (nannoptera group). Nevertheless, despite
being members of the same species group, these two taxa
may be up to 32 million years divergent [18], providing a
long period for the accumulation of such differences.
Unfortunately, similar comparisons of IGS length and
divergence time are not possible for many of the taxa
examined in this study because we lack divergence time
estimates.
The observation that close relatives tend to have similar
IGS indices, whereas more distant relatives may not, is
consistent with the observation that closely related taxa
exhibit a high degree of DNA sequence homology of the
IGS region [as observed among members of the melanogaster subgroup; [22]], whereas more distantly related
taxa exhibit no DNA sequence homology [as reported
between the subgenera Sophophora and Drosophila;
[16,23]], despite showing similarities in structure such as
promoter duplications.
The ecological and evolutionary implications of the broad
variation in IGS size observed across members of the Drosophilinae are largely unknown. However, several evolu-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/46

tionary mechanisms appear to play a role in the evolution
of IGS variation. First, as a member of the ribosomal DNA
multigene family, IGS is subject to concerted evolution
[24]. The pattern of concerted evolution appears to be the
result of unequal crossing over taking place both, at the
level of the subrepeat arrays within the intergenic spacers,
and at the level of the complete rDNA units (i.e., genes
plus spacers) [25]. The former would create new IGS
length variants while the latter would spread a particular
variant across the chromosome(s). In addition, the high
within-species specificity of the RNA polymerase I complex [26] suggests that IGS coevolves with components of
transcriptional machinery. Finally, individual IGS variants may be adaptive, particularly with regard to developmental rate, as suggested by studies of two unrelated taxa,
Drosophila melanogaster [5] and Daphnia pulex [6,8]. This
observation has led to the suggestion that IGS length
alone makes a considerable contribution to growth rate
differences and hence life history evolution among related
species [6]. Although in long evolutionary time scales, IGS
length is highly variable across Drosophila, it does not
appear vary broadly in shorter time scales. However,
examination of other species may reveal additional variation in shorter time scales that may provide the necessary
variation for testing this hypothesis. Nevertheless, tests of
this hypothesis will only be informative if IGS length is
accurately measured. Furthermore, even if IGS length is
found to be adaptive, the crucial assumption that IGS
length represents the number of promoter copies should
ultimately be tested by DNA sequencing.

Conclusion
Broad variation in average IGS length occurs across large
evolutionary scales in members of the subfamily Drosophilinae. However, despite the potential for rapid
changes in IGS length shown by artificial selection studies, closely related taxa tend to have similar IGS sizes. Our
comparison of methods suggests that PCR-based estimations tend to underestimate the true IGS size when the IGS
size is greater than 5 kb and thus, in the absence of DNA
sequence information for all the taxa under examination,
both methods should be used.

Methods
Taxon selection
To examine the extent of IGS length variation across the
subfamily Drosophilinae, where possible, we examined at
least one species per major species group. Our taxon sampling scheme spanned divergences of at least 40 [27] or 63
[19] million years based on the estimated average divergence between members of the subgenus Sophophora and
the subgenus Drosophila (genus Drosophila). To assess the
amount of IGS length variation present in shorter evolutionary time scales, we examined closely related species,
including sister species pairs.

Southern Blot
We extracted DNA from 1–10 individual female flies per
species. We only examined female flies to prevent any sex
bias in our interpretation. In D. melanogaster, and a few
other species, Nucleolar Organizer Regions (NORs) are
found on the X and Y chromosomes but in other species
the locations are not entirely clear [28,29]. Furthermore,
previous studies have shown that the Y-linked IGS variants of D. melanogaster are not related to differences in
development time [13]. Whole flies were homogenized in
250 µl of DNAzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and 0.1 mg
of Proteinase K, and incubated overnight at room temperature. Following centrifugation to discard cellular debris,
DNA was precipitated by addition of 125 µl of 100% ethanol and overnight incubation at -20°C. The DNA pellet
was recovered by centrifugation, then washed twice with
70% ethanol. DNA was resuspended in 20–100 µl of sterile deionized water and incubated 2–3 hr at 65°C.

We digested DNA extracts overnight with Hae III (New
England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) following manufacturer's
instructions, and treated with 0.4 µg/µl RNAse A for 5 min
at room temperature. The Hae III enzyme was selected
because Hae III sites are found on either end of the IGS in
Drosophila melanogaster (Figure 1), and its distant [i.e., 40–
63 million years divergent; [19,27]] relative D. virilis [17].
Hae III site No. 1 is also present in a distant relative of D.
melanogaster, D. hydei, but sequences of the 3' end of IGS
are lacking for this and other species, so presence of Hae
III site No. 2 has not been confirmed. We then treated the
digested DNA with SDS to a final concentration of 0.1%
and proteinase K to a final concentration of 20 µg/ml followed by a 30 min incubation at 37°C. This treatment
improves the migration of DNA during electrophoresis by
removal of contaminating protein [30].
Samples were electrophoresed on 0.9% agarose gels and
blotted onto positively charged Nylon membranes
(Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) with the VacuGene XL (Amersham Biosciences Corp, Piscataway, NJ)
according to manufacturer's instructions. DNA on the
membrane was then UV crosslinked with the Stratalinker
(Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX) according to manufacturer's
instructions.
We used a ~300 bp portion of the highly conserved 3' end
of the 28S gene as a hybridization probe (Figure 1). We
first amplified the fragment of interest in a solution containing ~1 µl of template in a final concentration of 1%
DMSO, 20% Betaine, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 5 mM MgCl, 0.2 µM
primers (28S-R3665 5'-TTATTTATCATTGCAGTCCAGCACGG-3' and 28S-F3349 5'CATAGCGACGTCGCTTTTTGATCC-3'), 2 units of Taq Polymerase (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) and 1X of Buffer provided by manufacturer.
The PCR template contained a mix of genomic DNA from

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/46

one species per species group examined. The temperature
profile had an initial denaturation of 2 min at 95°C, followed by 35 cycles of 1 min at 95°C, 1 min at 58°C and
1 min at 72°C, and a final extension of 7 min at 72°C.
The amplified product was electrophoresed on an agarose
gel and the fragment of interest was excised and used as
template for an asymmetric PCR. This reaction was identical to the first one with the exception that we used less
28S-R3665 primer (final concentration of 0.002 µM) and
we substituted regular dNTPs with those contained in the
DIG DNA Labeling Mix (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) to a final concentration of 0.4 mM. The labeled
product was purified by Ethanol precipitation with
Sodium Acetate, resuspended in ~100 µl, and added to
hybridization buffer (below).
Pre-hybridization, hybridization, and high stringency
washes were performed in a hybridization oven. All other
incubation/washes were performed with slight agitation.
Hybridization and washing solutions were prepared from
two stock buffers: 20X SSC (3M NaCl, 300 mM sodium
citrate, adjust with Citric Acid to pH 7.0) and 1X Maleic
Acid (0.1M Maleic Acid, 0.15M NaCl adjusted with NaOH
to pH 7.5). We incubated blotted membranes 2 hr at
68°C in prehybridization buffer [5X SSC; 2% (w/v) blocking reagent (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN)
dissolved by heating; 0.1% N-lauroylsarcosine; and
0.02% SDS (w/v)]. We then incubated membranes overnight at 68°C in hybridization buffer (same as prehybridization buffer plus probe). Hybridization buffer (with
probe) was boiled for at least 10 min prior to incubation.
We washed hybridized membranes (five 5-min washes at
room temperature) with a low stringency buffer (2X SSC
containing 0.1% SDS). We then washed membranes
(three 10-min washes at 68°C) with a high stringency
buffer (0.1X SSC containing 0.1% SDS). Membranes were
then equilibrated 2 min in washing buffer (1X Maleic
Acid; 0.3% (v/v) Tween 20). We incubated membranes 45
min at room temperature in blocking solution (2% (w/v)
blocking reagent in 1X Maleic Acid; dissolved by heating).
We then incubated membranes 45 min at room temperature in Antibody solution (i.e., blocking solution and
1:10,000 Anti-Digoxigenin-AP, Roche Applied Science,
Indianapolis, IN). Membranes were washed (two 10-min
washes) in washing buffer and equilibrated (2–5 min) in
detection buffer (0.1M Tris-HCl, 0.1m NaCl, pH 9.5). We
added the chemiluminescent substrate CSPD (Roche
Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) following manufacturer's protocol and exposed the membrane to Kodak
Biomax light-1 X-ray film for 15–180 min).
Analysis
X-rays were photographed with a Kodak Edas 290 digital
camera and analyzed with Kodak 1D 360 software to
determine molecular weight of each band observed as

well as its relative intensity (with respect to other bands in
the same lane). We use relative intensity as a proxy of relative copy number of each band.

tado and L.J. Weider provided helpful comments on earlier versions of this
manuscript. This work was funded by NSF-IRCEB (#9977047) to TAM.

We estimated the weighted average spacer length index (I)
for each lane based on the length (i.e., molecular weight)
and proportion (i.e., relative intensity) of each band as in
Cluster et al. [5]:

n

I = ∑ Si Pi
i =1

where n is the number of spacer bands in a lane, Si is the
fragment size (or molecular weight) of each band, and Pi
is the relative intensity. Si was estimated by comparison
with standards.

PCR amplification of IGS
To evaluate the consistency of PCR and Southern Blot
hybridization (SB) in estimation of IGS length, we amplified the IGS region from females of the same strains examined by SB. Our PCR reactions (25 µl total volume)
contained ~2 µl of template in a final concentration of 1%
DMSO, 20% Betaine, 0.4 mM each dNTP, 3 mM MgCl,
0.2 µM primers IGSF2 5'-GTGCTGGACTGCAATGATAAATAAGG-3' (K. Glenn, unpublished) and IGSR1 5'AAGCATATAACTACTGGCAGGATCAACC-3' (Y-C. Li,
unpublished), 2 units of Taq Polymerase (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) and 1X of Buffer provided by manufacturer.
The IGSF2 primer is located in a conserved region at the
3'-end of the 28S gene; approximately 300 bp downstream of Hae III site No. 1 in two distantly related species
[i.e., D. melanogaster; 23 and D. hydei; GenBank Acc. Nos.
M21017 and AF465783, respectively; see Figure 1]. The
IGSR1 primer is located in a relatively conserved region of
the 18S gene; approximately 200 bp downstream of Hae
III site No. 2 in D. melanogaster and D. virilis [23]; two distantly related species. Therefore, the amplified IGS fragments were expected to have a single restriction site near
the 3'end. Following PCR, half of the amplified product
was treated with Hae III to establish whether Hae III sites
existed within the PCR amplified fragments. The Hae IIItreated and untreated PCR products were run side by side
on 1% agarose gels.
