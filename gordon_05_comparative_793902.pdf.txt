Abstract
Background: The phylum Apicomplexa is an early-branching eukaryotic lineage that contains a
number of important human and animal pathogens. Their complex life cycles and unique
cytoskeletal features distinguish them from other model eukaryotes. Apicomplexans rely on actinbased motility for cell invasion, yet the regulation of this system remains largely unknown.
Consequently, we focused our efforts on identifying actin-related proteins in the recently
completed genomes of Toxoplasma gondii, Plasmodium spp., Cryptosporidium spp., and Theileria spp.
Results: Comparative genomic and phylogenetic studies of apicomplexan genomes reveals that
most contain only a single conventional actin and yet they each have 8–10 additional actin-related
proteins. Among these are a highly conserved Arp1 protein (likely part of a conserved dynactin
complex), and Arp4 and Arp6 homologues (subunits of the chromatin-remodeling machinery). In
contrast, apicomplexans lack canonical Arp2 or Arp3 proteins, suggesting they lost the Arp2/3 actin
polymerization complex on their evolutionary path towards intracellular parasitism. Seven of these
actin-like proteins (ALPs) are novel to apicomplexans. They show no phylogenetic associations to
the known Arp groups and likely serve functions specific to this important group of intracellular
parasites.
Conclusion: The large diversity of actin-like proteins in apicomplexans suggests that the actin
protein family has diverged to fulfill various roles in the unique biology of intracellular parasites.
Conserved Arps likely participate in vesicular transport and gene expression, while apicomplexanspecific ALPs may control unique biological traits such as actin-based gliding motility.

Background
The phylum Apicomplexa contains several protozoan
pathogens that cause severe disease in mammals, including humans. Members such as Plasmodium falciparum, and
P. vivax, which cause severe human malaria, and Theileria
parva and T. annulata, which are responsible for economic
losses in cattle in Africa, result in profound medical,
social, and economic effects [1,2]. Others such as Toxoplasma gondii, Cryptosporidium parvum and C. hominis are

primarily health threats in HIV+/AIDS and immunosuppressed populations [3].
Apicomplexans are primarily obligate intracellular parasites that rely on actin-based motility for cell invasion [4].
Invasion occurs by active parasite motility that is coupled
to timed secretion of proteins from specialized apical
secretory organelles, which are a hallmark feature of this
phylum [5,6]. The apical secretory organelles (called

Phylogenetic comparisons of actin and actin-related proteins in apicomplexans and model organisms
Phylogenetic comparisons of actin and actin-related proteins in apicomplexans and model organisms. In addition to conventional actins, apicomplexans contain conserved Arp1, Arp4, and Arp6 proteins; however, they do not encode
Arp2 or Arp3 orthologues. Many apicomplexan proteins do not group with any of the known Arp clades. These have been
divided further into proteins that are highly conserved among all the apicomplexans (i.e. ALP1, ALP2, ALP3) and those that are
organism-specific (i.e. ALP5, ALP7, ALP8). Phylogenetic analysis was performed using PAUP*4.0b10 and the BioNeighbor-Joining algorithm (BioNJ) to determine the divergence distances among taxa. Consensus trees were bootstrapped for 1000 replicates and drawn according to the 50% majority-rule. Conventional actin was defined as the out-group. Subgroups of Arps and
ALPs have been highlighted to define the boundaries between groups. Taxa are as follows: At = Arabidopsis thaliana, Bs = Bacillus subtilis, Ce = Caenorhabditis elegans, Cp = Cryptosporidium parvum, Dd = Dictyostelium discodium, Dm = Drosophila melanogaster, Hs = Homo sapiens, Pf = Plasmodium falciparum, Sc = Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Tg = Toxoplasma gondii, Tp = Theileria

in the apicomplexans. Relationships were calculated in PAUP*4.01b using the heuristic algorithm and verified by bootstrapping
(>100 replicates). Consensus trees were drawn according to the bootstrap 50% majority-rule. Conventional actins were

micronemes, rhoptries, and dense granules) release their
contents in a highly regulated fashion upon host cell
interactions [7]. Microneme proteins provide adhesion to
the host cells and supply the traction needed for invasion.
Rhoptry and dense granule proteins function in the establishment and maintenance of a protective, intracellular
niche called the parasitophorous vacuole (reviewed in
[8]). Understanding how motility and invasion are regulated is crucial to elucidating the pathobiology of these
organisms, yet we know relatively little about how these
functions are controlled at the cellular level.
Apicomplexans are characterized by a unique cytoskeleton that is distinct from that of other eukaryotes [9]. At
their apical end is a specialized microtubule-organizing
center called the polar ring complex, which coordinates a
series of singlet microtubules called the subpellicular
microtubules [10,11]. The remarkable stability of these
microtubules provides a defined shape and polarity to the
cells that is necessary for motility and invasion [12]. The
subpellicular microtubules encompass the apical secretory organelles and may play a role in trafficking to the
apical end of the cell. Apicomplexans also regulate their
actin cytoskeleton differently, maintaining a large pool of
soluble actin, both globular and in short, unstable filaments [13-15]. During motility, actin filaments must rapidly assemble to support gliding and then turnover
rapidly to prevent unwanted movement. Actin regulation
is thus crucial to the control of motility. In other eukaryotes, a large family of actin-related proteins helps control
many cytoskeletal functions including vesicle transport
and actin-based motility.
Actin-related proteins (Arps) are conserved across all
eukaryotes and some prokaryotes. Although all members
share a common actin-fold and an overall sequence similarity to actin [16-18], individual Arps carry out a variety
of biochemical and structural roles in the cell [19]. These
include roles in cell division [20], translocation of cargo
along microtubules via dynein [21,22], actin polymerization [23], and transcriptional regulation via chromatin/
heterochromatin remodeling [24-26]. Currently, more
than 11 classes of Arps have been reported from a broad
range of eukaryotes including plants, animals, fungi, and
protozoans (i.e. Dictyostelium, Acanthamoeba, and Tetrahymena). In each case, the Arp groups link the separate kingdoms both by protein similarity and common
biochemical functions. Despite their apparent conservation among the majority of eukaryotes, no Arps have been
previously described in the Apicomplexa.
Complete genome sequences have recently been provided
for a variety of apicomplexan parasites. A cursory examination of these genomes reveals multiple actins and actin
related proteins; however, these have been inconsistently

identified and annotated. The complex biology of these
parasites led us to examine actin-related proteins in this
phylum relative to other eukaryotes using a combination
of phylogenetic and reciprocal BLAST analyses. Our findings reveal a complexity of actin-related proteins not previously appreciated and define both conserved and
unique members of this protein family within the Apicomplexa.

Results and discussion
Phylogenetic comparisons of actin-like proteins in
apicomplexans
We searched the recently completed genomes of Toxoplasma gondii, Plasmodium spp., Cryptosporidium spp., and
Theileria spp. for actin-related proteins using conventional
actins and conserved Arp proteins from organisms spanning several phyla including mammals, plants, flies,
worms, yeast, and protozoa [see Additional File 1]. BLAST
analysis identified over 60 candidate actin-related proteins in total among the apicomplexan genomes examined in this study (Table 1). Reciprocal BLASTP searches
using each of these apicomplexan actin-like proteins
against the NCBI CDD database revealed that the majority
of them contain a conserved actin domain (pfam00022)
(Table 1). However, at present individual actin-related
protein groups have not been defined by distinct domains
or motifs common to members of only one group. Consequently, we sought to establish relationships between
the apicomplexan actin-like proteins and conventional
Arps using sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses. Candidate actin-related proteins were aligned with a
broader spectrum of Arps from a variety of eukaryotic taxa
and bacterial actin-like proteins using CLUSTALX [27].
The relative divergence of actin-like proteins was determined by Neighbor-Joining distance analysis using the
phylogenetic analysis program PAUP*4.01b [28]. The
resulting bootstrapped phylogram is shown in Fig. 1. Parsimony analysis revealed a similar branching pattern for
the major Arp groups, but was less able to resolve deep
branching groups (i.e. Arp4 and various apicomplexan
specific ALPs), likely due to the divergence of these
sequences (Fig. 2). We have focused primarily on the relationships supported by distance analysis, since this methodology is more appropriate for highly divergent
sequences.

Our analysis reveals that the apicomplexans all encode a
single conventional actin (with the exception of Plasmodium which has two conventional actins), and the
remaining proteins form a total of 10 distinct actin-related
protein groups (Fig. 1). Three of these groups were shown
to belong to well-characterized Arps including Arp1, Arp4,
and Arp6 (Fig. 1). In contrast, we discovered that several
other apicomplexan actin-like proteins (ALPs) were
unique to this phylum, as they did not group with any of

the conventional Arps (i.e. ALP1 and ALP2)(Fig.1); therefore, we have used the designation actin-like protein
(ALP) to differentiate the apicomplexan-specific protein
groups. A comparison of actin-like proteins within the
Apicomplexa is summarized in Table 1. The remaining
ALPs were specific to a subset of apicomplexans such as
Toxoplasma (i.e. ALPs 8, and 9), Cryptosporidium (i.e.
ALP7) and Plasmodium (i.e. ALP5). Several of these
groups also contain paralogues, for example ALP5a and
ALP5b in Plasmodium (Fig.1). While some ALPs appear
as deep branches (i.e. TpALP4b, PfALP2b, CpALP7a and
CpALP7b, TgALP2a, TgALP3) they were grouped and
hence named in part based on BLAST results (Table 1) and
phylogenetic analysis of apicomplexan ALPs compared in
the absence of other organisms (data not shown). Our
findings suggest that some actin-like proteins play roles
that are conserved across all eukaryotes while other members of this group have diverged to fulfill specific roles
within the Apicomplexa.
The two key features most prominent about the apicomplexan actin-like proteins are their strong conservation of
the Arp1 protein (a major component of the dynactin
complex) and their remarkable lack of both Arp2 and
Arp3 homologues (subunits of the Arp2/3 actin polymerization complex) (Fig. 1). The presence of a highly conserved Arp1 and the absence of Arp2 and Arp3
orthologues have important biochemical implications for
these parasites regarding vesicular trafficking and actin
regulation, respectively. Arp1 is an essential component of
the dynactin complex involved in vesicular trafficking
[29,30] while Arp2/3 forms a multi-subunit complex that
is the primary means of regulating actin polymerization in
eukaryotic cells [31,32]. For these reasons, we conducted
a more comprehensive study of the protein components
that constitute these complexes.
The dynactin complex
Dynactin is a microtubule-associated complex that is critical for tethering cellular cargo to the cytoplasmic motor
protein dynein [30]. Cytoplasmic dynein consists of
heavy, light, intermediate, and intermediate light chains
in addition to several regulatory subunits [33]. We
searched the P. falciparum and C. parvum genomes to identify components of this complex using text word searches.
Convincing orthologues for all of the subunits were found
in both parasites as shown by reciprocal BLASTP and the
presence of conserved pfam domains (Table 2). These hits
were then used to identify orthologues in other apicomplexan genomes by BLASTP as verified by both significant
BLAST E-values and the presence of conserved pfam
domains (Table 2). Somewhat surprisingly, a complete
complex was not readily identified in Theileria, with the
exception of subunits for heavy and light chains (Table 2).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/179

Based on the presence of a conserved dynein complex in a
majority of apicomplexans, we thought it reasonable to
search for evidence of a dynactin complex. The dynactin
complex consists of several protein subunits that are
grouped into two domains: the Arp1 rod and a flexible
arm region. The protein subunits of the Arp1 rod are more
highly conserved between eukaryotes than the remaining
dynactin subunits [30]; therefore, we focused our efforts
on defining homologues to these proteins in the apicomplexans. The subunits comprising the Arp1 rod include
Arp1, Arp11, capping protein (CapZ), p62, p25, p27, and
actin (see [30] for a complete review of the dynactin complex).
We used database searches to identify the dynactin subunits within apicomplexans. Sequences from mammals,
flies, worms, and protozoa were compared against the
NBCI nr database and the respective genomic databases of
Toxoplasma, Plasmodium, and Cryptosporidium (Table 3)
[see Additional file 1]. Arp1 was readily identified in Plasmodium, Cryptosporidium, and Toxoplasma, although it is
apparently absent in Theileria (Table 1). Highly conserved
orthologues of the p25, p27, and p62 subunits were
found in Toxoplasma, Plasmodium, and Cryptosporidium as
shown by both significant BLASTP E-values and the presence of conserved pfam domains (Table 3).
The Arp1 rod contains a short filament of Arp1 subunits
[34] that is capped at both ends. The (+) or barbed end is
terminated by capping protein [35] and the (-) or pointed
end by the actin-related protein Arp11 [36]. Toxoplasma
and Plasmodium both contain β subunits of capping protein, and the α subunit in Plasmodium showed a significant BLASTP E-value and conserved pfam motif (Table 3).
The α subunit reported for Toxoplasma is highly divergent
(NCBI AAU93918) and does not have significant
matches, although BLASTP searches turn up a number of
α subunit orthologues (Table 3). Additionally only the β
subunit was identified in Cryptosporidium (Table 3). Capping protein always exists as an α/β dimer [37] and it is
possible the α subunit is divergent in Toxoplasma and
Cryptosporidium and hence difficult to recognize at present.
Our phylogenetic analysis of the Arps did not show strong
affinities between any of the ALP proteins and the Arp11
group (Fig. 1). However, we have included TgALP3,
PfALP3, and CpALP3 as possible Arp11 orthologues based
on their sequence similarity to the Arp11 proteins in
BLASTP searches (Table 3).
Dynamitin is a component of the flexible arm region of
the dynactin complex [30]. We identified proteins with
recognizable dynamitin domains in Toxoplasma and Plasmodium, but not Cryptosporidium (Table 3). The remaining
subunits of the dynactin complex were not detected by
BLAST or protein domain searches in these organisms.

Table 3: Conserved Dynactin Subunits in Apicomplexans

BMC Genomics 2005, 6:179

However since these other subunits are less well
conserved, failure to detect them by BLAST is not
surprising.
The identification of apicomplexan orthologues
to all the subunits of the Arp1 rod, and the presence of dynamitin in Toxoplasma and Plasmodium,
provides strongly supportive evidence that a functional complex exists in these parasites. Theileria
appears to be an exception to this pattern as neither Arp1 or the other subunits were recognized.
The conserved complex in parasites likely carries
out duties analogous to the dynactin in other
eukaryotes. One possible role for this complex
would be the directed delivery of secretory protein vesicles
as has been described in other systems [29]. Secretory protein trafficking occurs via an ER-Golgi mediated pathway
[38] and dynactin could provide the transportation by
which cargo vesicles reach their specialized secretory
organelles at the apical pole. Apical secretion is an important component of cellular invasion and maintenance of
this polarization is thus vital to the survival of the parasite.
The Arp2/3 actin polymerization complex
The Arp2/3 complex consists of 7 subunits that
regulate actin polymerization at the leading edge
in motile cells [23], as well as providing a propulsive force
to move endosomes throughout the cytoplasm [39,40].
Arp2/3 is a major nucleator of actin polymerization in
most eukaryotic cells; however, our phylogenetic analyses
of the apicomplexan actin-related proteins did not show
homologues to either Arp2 or Arp3 (Fig. 1). Notably, Arp2
and Arp3 homologues have been previously annotated in
both the Plasmodium and Cryptosporidium genome databases (PfArp3: CAD51790, PfArp2: CAD49164, CpArp3:
EAK88375, and CpArp2, EAK88162). These proteins correspond to our annotations PfALP5a, PfALP5b, CpALP7a,
and CpALP7b, respectively. Phylogenetic comparisons do
not support these previously proposed annotations, but
rather indicate that these actin-like proteins are part of
other ALP groups (Fig. 1).

A recent analysis of the actin family from model organisms was utilized to derive predictive models for grouping
Arp groups in a variety of taxa [41]. Importantly, this analysis also found Arp1, Arp4, and Arp6 homologues among
the Apicomplexa (Plasmodium and Cryptosporidium
genomes) but failed to identify orthologues of Arp2, Arp3
or other Arp groups [41]. Collectively, these findings indicate apicomplexans do not encode a conserved Arp2/3
complex.
We also searched for the other 5 subunits of the Arp2/3
complex that are known as actin-related protein complex
1 (ARPC1)/p41, ARPC2/p34, ARPC3/p21, ARPC4/p20,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/179

and ARPC5/p16. A separately recognized domain is only
described for ARPC4/p20 (pfam05856), perhaps reflecting the divergence of the remaining subunits across the
many taxa where they are readily identified by BLAST. We
conducted genome-wide BLAST searches of apicomplexans as described above using ARPC proteins from mammals, flies, yeast, plants, and protozoa (see Table 4) [see
Additional file 1]. No proteins with similarity to subunits
ARPC2, 3, and 5 were found in any of the four apicomplexan genomes.
Potential orthologues to the ARPC1/p41 were found in
Plasmodium and Cryptosporidium (Table 3): both of these
proteins contain WD40 repeats, which are a distinguishing feature of the ARPC1/p41 proteins in other eukaryotes
[42]. This analysis was supported by BLAST and also by
protein domain searches using Prosite, which identified
WD40 repeat domains in both proteins (Pfam PF00400,
SMART domain SM00320). WD40 repeats mediate protein-protein interactions and are involved in regulating
numerous biological functions in addition to their role in
actin nucleation [43,44]. Since ARPC1/p41 is not necessary for the overall cohesiveness of the Arp2/3 subunits
[45], we can hypothesize this protein may serve an alternative function outside of the Arp2/3 complex in Plasmodium and Cryptosporidium.
Surprisingly, Cryptosporidium encodes a conserved ARPC4/
p20 subunit as shown by BLAST analysis and by Prosite
domain similarity (pfam PF05856) (Table 4). In other
eukaryotes, ARPC4 forms a stable heterodimeric complex
with ARPC2/p34 that comprises the structural core of the
Arp2/3 complex [45]. In the absence of ARPC4/p20,
Arp2/3 complexes are not formed [45], underscoring its
importance to the protein scaffold. It is therefore unusual
that Cryptosporidium would retain a close orthologue to
one subunit and completely lack the other (Table 4).
Additionally, the ARPC2/ARPC4 heterodimer binds actin
filaments and is thought to be necessary for branching of
daughter filaments from existing mother filaments [45].
Actin in Toxoplasma does not appear to be branched [46],
thus it is unclear why Cryptosporidium maintains an
ARPC4 homologue (Table 4).
The presence of remnant ARPC1/p41 homologues in Plasmodium and Cryptosporidium, and ARPC4/p20 in Cryptosporidium indicates that the complex may have been
functional at one time in these parasites; however, they
either have since lost the complex completely or the subunits have diverged to the extent that they are no longer
recognizable. Support for this hypothesis comes from
other alveolates, such as the closely-related but deeper
branching ciliate lineages [47]. The ciliate Tetrahymena
thermophilia encodes a canonical Arp2/3 complex with
easily
recognizable

(AAN73250), ARPC2 (4.m00362), ARPC3 (43.m00326)
and ARPC4 (152.m00065) subunits. Loss of a functional
complex in the apicomplexans may have resulted from
their highly specialized, intracellular lifestyles. Deciphering how apicomplexans control actinfilament turnover is
thus an intriguing and unanswered question. We postulate that evolution of alternative proteins, such as the
ALP1 proteins (Fig. 1), could enable parasites to regulate
actin polymerization in a more streamlined mechanism,
yet maintain the overall function of the complex.
The ALP1 group of apicomplexan-specific proteins is phylogenetically similar to both the Arp2 and Arp3. ALP1 in
Toxoplasma is the second closest paralogue to conventional actin with which it shares 37% identity and 57%
similarity (Table 1). Moreover, TgALP1 is 49% identical to
PfALP1 and 45% identical to CpALP1, indicating the
ALP1 proteins are highly conserved within this phylum
(Table 1). These phylogenetic properties, in conjunction
with the lack of any obvious Arp2 or Arp3 homologues,
lead us to hypothesize that the ALP1 proteins may play a
corresponding or complementary role to these two proteins in the apicomplexans.
Arps and chromatin remodeling
In addition to their cytoskeletal roles, actin and Arps function in the nucleus as components of chromatin-modifying and chromatin-remodeling protein complexes [48].
These Arps include Arp4, Arp5, Arp6 and Arp8 [26,49-51].
Arps 7 and 9 are yeast-specific and do not have homologues in other eukaryotes [48]. Our studies show the apicomplexans encode conventional Arp4 and Arp6
orthologues (Fig. 1).

Chromatin-modifying and -remodeling machinery are
involved in DNA replication, DNA repair mechanisms
and transcriptional regulation [52]. Arp4 is present in several complexes including the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase and several members of the ATP-dependent SWI2SNF2 family of chromatin-remodeling complexes
[51,53]. In yeast, Arp6 is also a member of SWR1, a subgroup of the SWI2/SNF2 chromatin-remodeling complexes [50]. Other roles for Arp6 include transcriptional
deactivation via heterochromatin-remodeling in Drosophila and vertebrates [24].
Changes in gene expression are important means of regulating function and such changes have been shown to play
a role in parasite stage-differentiation [54-56]. The Plasmodium and Cryptosporidium genomes appear to lack many
common transcription factors leading to the hypothesis
that these parasites rely heavily on chromatin-remodeling
for transcriptional control [57,58]. This is supported by
the fact that apicomplexans appear to contain several
components of the SWI2/SNF2 ATPase chromatin-remod-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/179

eling machinery [57,58]. Recently, Saksouk et. al. showed
the first direct correlation of histone acetylation and
methylation to stage-specific gene expression in Toxoplasma [59], supporting the importance of chromatin
modification and remodeling in these parasites. The presence of conserved Arp4 and Arp6 orthologues suggests
that actin-related proteins participate in chromatin
remodeling in apicomplexans similar to other eukaryotes.

Conclusion
Comprehensive analysis of the genome content of these
parasites combined with phylogenetic groupings has
allowed us to propose potential functions for many of
these Arp/ALP groups. Our findings indicate that apicomplexans encode a variety of actin-like proteins (ALPs) that
likely participate in actin-based motility, vesicle transport,
and transcriptional regulation through chromatin remodeling. Delineating their respective functions will ultimately enrich our understanding of these parasites, and
also the evolution of the actin family as a whole.

Methods
Assembly of actin-like proteins from apicomplexans and
other alveolates
Comprehensive BLAST searches were performed against
the T. gondii genome database (ToxoDB Release v3.0)
using 27 protein sequences from Arp1 through Arp4 that
represented major taxa including mammals, plants, flies,
worms, yeast, and protozoa. Actin-like proteins were identified in Plasmodium spp. (PlasmoDB Release v4.3) and C.
parvum (NCBI nr database and CryptoDB Release v3.0) by
combination of tBLASTn and BLASTP searches using the
above conserved Arps or Toxoplasma candidate actin-like
sequences. BLAST searches were restricted to only high
quality "hits" (e-value of ≤ .0001). In the case where only
nucleotide data was available, the matching nucleotide
sequence was translated using the GENESCAN webserver
[60] using Arabidopsis thaliana to predict exon-intron
structures. In these cases, the resulting amino acid
sequence predictions were used in all subsequent analyses. Once identified, candidate sequences were entered
into a "reverse" BLAST search of the NCBI database [61] to
determine if there was a reciprocal best match to the protein used to identify it.

Protein candidates from Tetrahymena thermophila were
obtained via BLASTP searches of the NCBI nr database
comparing Arps from model organisms and by searching
the Tetrahymena genome database [62]. Searches of the
Tetrahymena genome database were done using tBLASTn
and restricted to TIGR predicted proteins.
Preliminary sequence data was obtained from The Institute for Genomic Research website [63], ToxoDB [64],
PlasmoDB [65], CryptoDB [66].

A complete list of all taxa and accession/contig numbers
used in these studies is provided [see Additional file 1].
CLUSTALX alignments
The above candidate actin-like protein sequences were
compared with a larger repertoire of Arp proteins from a
variety of eukaryotes [67] and bacterial actin-like proteins
retrieved from NCBI. All sequences were entered into the
alignment program CLUSTALX [27] using pairwise
parameters set as: gap opening penalty = 15.0, gap extension penalty = 0.10; and multiple alignment parameters
set as: gap opening penalty = 15.0, gap extension penalty
= 0.30, delay divergent sequences (%) = 25. All other
parameters were set to the default settings. Clustal alignments used in this analysis are posted at [68].
Phylogenetic analysis
CLUSTAL alignments were entered into the phylogenetic
analysis program PAUP4.0b10 for Macintosh [28]. Only
regions of the alignments with conservation across all taxa
were included in the analyses. The optimality criterion
was set to distance (mean character difference, minimal
evolution, negative branches = 0) and 1000 bootstrap replicates were performed using the BioNeighbor-Joining
(BioNJ) algorithm. Alternatively, a full heuristic algorithm
was used for parsimony analysis, supported by bootstrapping for > 100 replicates. Consensus trees were drawn
according to the Bootstrap 50% majority-rule and conventional actins were defined as the out-group.
