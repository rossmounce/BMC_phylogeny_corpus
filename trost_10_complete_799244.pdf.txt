Abstract
Background: Corynebacterium aurimucosum is a slightly yellowish, non-lipophilic, facultative anaerobic member of
the genus Corynebacterium and predominantly isolated from human clinical specimens. Unusual black-pigmented
variants of C. aurimucosum (originally named as C. nigricans) continue to be recovered from the female urogenital
tract and they are associated with complications during pregnancy. C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975 (C. nigricans CN1) was originally isolated from a vaginal swab of a 34-year-old woman who experienced a spontaneous abortion
during month six of pregnancy. For a better understanding of the physiology and lifestyle of this potential
urogenital pathogen, the complete genome sequence of C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975 was determined.
Results: Sequencing and assembly of the C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975 genome yielded a circular chromosome of
2,790,189 bp in size and the 29,037-bp plasmid pET44827. Specific gene sets associated with the central
metabolism of C. aurimucosum apparently provide enhanced metabolic flexibility and adaptability in aerobic,
anaerobic and low-pH environments, including gene clusters for the uptake and degradation of aromatic amines,
L-histidine and L-tartrate as well as a gene region for the formation of selenocysteine and its incorporation into
formate dehydrogenase. Plasmid pET44827 codes for a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase that plays the pivotal
role in the synthesis of the characteristic black pigment of C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975.
Conclusions: The data obtained by the genome project suggest that C. aurimucosum could be both a resident of
the human gut and possibly a pathogen in the female genital tract causing complications during pregnancy. Since
hitherto all black-pigmented C. aurimucosum strains have been recovered from female genital source, biosynthesis
of the pigment is apparently required for colonization by protecting the bacterial cells against the high hydrogen
peroxide concentration in the vaginal environment. The location of the corresponding genes on plasmid pET44827
explains why black-pigmented (formerly C. nigricans) and non-pigmented C. aurimucosum strains were isolated
from clinical specimens.

Background
In 2002, Corynebacterium aurimucosum was taxonomically described as new species within the genus Corynebacterium, with C. minutissimum as the nearest
phylogenetic neighbour [1,2]. The phylogenetic and
molecular taxonomic description was based on two isolates from human clinical specimens, one from an
unknown source and one from blood cultures of a
patient with bronchitis. C. aurimucosum is a non-lipophilic species, and growth is facultatively anaerobic. On
Columbia blood agar colonies are generally slightly yellow in colour [1]. The isolation of C. aurimucosum from
other human clinical sources has been reported, although
very rarely. C. aurimucosum was detected in samples
from patients with acute or chronic joint or bone infections [3,4], in infected diabetic foot wounds [5] and in a
biopsy sample from a patient with rheumatoid arthritis
[6]. Furthermore, C. aurimucosum 16S rDNA was
detected in a bacterial population collected in the
entrance area of a clean room environment in the Johnson Space Center [7,8] and in dust samples taken from
office rooms in buildings located in central Finland [9].
Moreover, unusual charcoal-black-pigmented variants
of C. aurimucosum were isolated in the U.S.A. and
Canada from female urogenital sources, mostly from
vaginal and cervical swabs [10-12]. In 2001, Shukla and
co-workers reported the characterization of strain CN-1
(ATCC 700975) that was isolated from a vaginal swab
of a 34-year-old female who experienced a spontaneous
abortion during month six of pregnancy [10]. Subsequently, additional isolates with similar phenotypic and
genotypic characteristics were recovered from the genital tract of women who had complications during pregnancy [12,13], suggesting that this newly recognized
corynebacterium might be an opportunistic pathogen in
pregnant women [13]. According to their black pigmentation, the name Corynebacterium nigricans was proposed for these isolates, and CN-1 was selected as type
strain of this species [14]. However, morphological and
biochemical analyses and sequencing of 16S rRNA
genes in a polyphasic study of black-pigmented coryneform bacteria from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) group FCG4 suggested that C. nigricans is a later synonym for C. aurimucosum [12].
In this study, we present the complete genome
sequence and bioinformatics analysis of C. aurimucosum
ATCC 700975 (C. nigricans CN-1) to obtain insights
into the physiology and lifestyle of this potential urogenital pathogen. Strain CN-1 was originally isolated from a
female who presented with the sudden onset of premature labor during month six of gestation. The medical
history of the patient was unremarkable, but the fetus
died during vaginal delivery. A vaginal sample was taken

Page 2 of 16

at the time of delivery and revealed moderate growth of
a black-pigmented corynebacterium in conjunction with
other normal vaginal flora [10].

Results
Pyrosequencing and annotation of the C. aurimucosum
ATCC 700975 genome

The complete genome sequence of the clinical isolate C.
aurimucosum ATCC 700975 was determined by combining a whole-genome shotgun approach performed by
pyrosequencing with a whole-genome scaffold generated
by fosmid technology (Fig. 1A). A single run with the
Genome Sequencer FLX System yielded 594,627 reads
and a total number of 136,924,144 bases that were
assembled into 73 large (≥ 500 bases) contigs. These
assembled DNA sequences (2,736,233 bases) were combined with 215 Sanger reads performed on selected fosmid clones that covered the gaps between 70
chromosomal contigs. The resulting assembly of the
DNA sequence data into a circular chromosome of
2,790,189 bp was consistent with the whole-genome
scaffold deduced from 432 terminal insert sequences of
randomly selected fosmid clones (Fig. 1B), corroborating
the accuracy of the assembly process that was guided by
the Consed program [15]. The gaps between the three
remaining contigs (28,223 bases) were bridged by PCR,
resulting in a circular contig of 29,037 bp in length.
This assembled DNA sequence represents an endogenous plasmid of C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975, named
pET44827 (Fig. 1C). The average gap size between the
70 chromosomal contigs was 1174 bp and 271 bp
between the three plasmid contigs. Considering the final
size of the C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975 genome, a
49-fold coverage was initially obtained by pyrosequencing. Relevant data of the C. aurimucosum ATCC
700975 genome project are summarized in Table 1.
The circular chromosome of C. aurimucosum ATCC
700975 has a size of 2,790,189 bp and a mean G+C

content of 60.6% (Fig. 1A), which is slightly below the
value of 63.7% that was previously determined by highperformance liquid chromatography [1]. Gene prediction
and annotation of the genome sequence were performed
with the GenDB system [16] and resulted in the detection of 2,531 protein-coding regions on the C. aurimucosum chromosome. On plasmid pET44827, twenty
protein-coding sequences and eight pseudogenes were
detected (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, 55 tRNA genes were
found by the tRNAscan-SE program [17], and four rrn
operons were identified on the leading strands of the C.
aurimucosum chromosome, one on the right and three
on the left replichore.
General architecture of the C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975
genome: moderate chromosomal reorganization in the
main lineage of the genus Corynebacterium

The calculation of the G/C skew [(G-C)/(G+C)] [18]
indicated a bi-directional replication mechanism of the
C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975 chromosome (Fig. 1A).

The origin of replication (oriC) was detected with OriFinder, a web-based tool for oriC prediction in bacterial
genomes [19]. According to the presence and distribution of seven conserved DnaA boxes [TTATC(C/A)A(C/
A)A], the oriC is located downstream of the dnaA
(cauri_0001) coding region and has a computed length
of 423 bp. The calculated G/C skew additionally indicated the presence of a putative dif region involved in
replication termination [20] at the expected position of
180° from oriC, dividing the chromosome of C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975 in two replichores of similar size
(Fig. 1A). For a more precise detection of a potential dif
region, the distribution of the architecture imparting
sequences G(A/T/C)GGGGGA and (T/C)GGGGGAG
[21] was plotted on the leading and lagging strands of
the C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975 chromosome (Fig.
2A). These octamers are present in 856 copies on the
leading strands and in only 61 copies on the lagging
strands of the C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975

chromosome. This characteristic distribution pattern of
architecture imparting sequences revealed a putative dif
region at around 1,425 kb of the chromosomal map
(Fig. 2A). In accordance with this result, the respective
DNA region of the C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975
chromosome contains a 28-bp sequence that showed
striking similarity to the consensus sequence of actinobacterial dif sites [20] (Fig. 2B).
Synteny analysis by reciprocal best matches with
BLASTP [22] revealed a conserved order of orthologous
genes between the C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975 chromosome and other pathogenic corynebacteria, in particular with C. diphtheriae NCTC 13129 displaying two
breakpoints of synteny at 1,298 kb and 1,537 kb of the
C. aurimucosum chromosomal map (Fig. 3). The comparison between the gene order of C. aurimucosum
ATCC 700975 and C. jeikeium K411, C. urealyticum
DSM7109 and C. kroppenstedtii DSM44385 revealed
additional breakpoints in the chromosomal organization
(Fig. 3), which is consistent with the taxonomic position
of the latter three species that are part of independent
branches in the phylogenetic tree of the genus Corynebacterium [2]. The two breakpoints of synteny between
the chromosomes of C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975
and C. diphtheriae NCTC 13129 are indicative of a symmetric inversion of a 239-kb chromosomal DNA segment (carrying the genes cauri_1172 to cauri_1381)
around the terminus of replication. The detected inversion in the C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975 chromosome
provides the first example of a moderate genetic reorganization in genomes of members from the main lineage

Page 4 of 16

of the genus Corynebacterium, since all hitherto completely sequenced genomes (C. diphtheriae NCTC 13129,
C. glutamicum ATCC 13032, C. efficiens YS-314) displayed an overall synteny of their gene order [23].
Due to the symmetric inversion around the terminus
of the C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975 chromosome, the
preferential location of the respective genes on either
the leading or lagging strands and their distance from
the terminus region remained conserved after the chromosomal reorganization [24]. In general, 61% of the predicted C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975 genes are located
on the leading strands of both replichores, while 39%
are encoded on the lagging strands. It has been suggested that essentiality is the driving force for such type
of gene-strand bias in bacterial genomes [25]. To detect
candidate essential genes in the C. aurimucosum ATCC
700975 genome, the predicted gene repertoire was compared with that of C. glutamicum strain R [26], as genes
shared by multiple genomes are more likely to be essential [27]. In addition, a high-density transposon mutagenesis approach in C. glutamicum R had already
revealed 658 candidate essential genes in this strain,
using complex medium and standard laboratory conditions for the selection of transposon mutants [28]. This
number of candidate essential genes obviously represents an overestimate, at least due to polar effects
caused by some transposon insertions [27]. The comparative genomics approach detected 352 coding regions
of C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975 with high similarity
to candidate essential genes from C. glutamicum R.
Among this set of candidate essential genes, 78.8% are

Figure 3 Synteny between the chromosome of C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975 and those from C. diphtheriae NCTC 13129, C. jeikeium

the chromosomes of pathogenic corynebacteria. Each dot represents a predicted C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975 protein having an ortholog in

located on the leading strands of the C. aurimucosum
ATCC 700975 chromosome, while 21.2% are encoded
on the lagging strands, which is consistent with the
aforementioned interpretation of gene-strand bias in
bacterial genomes [25].
The annotation of the C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975
chromosome revealed the presence of two putative prophages. This observation is consistent with the lack of
homology of the respective chromosomal region to the
genomes of other pathogenic corynebacteria (Fig. 1A)
and with a lack of synteny when compared with the
genome sequence of C. diphtheriae NCTC 13129 (Fig.
3). The first prophage-like region (jCauriI) was detected
adjacent to tRNALeu and tRNAGln genes of C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975 that may represent the integration
site of jCauriI. This genome region has a size of about
20.7 kb and encodes 35 genes (cauri_1932 to
cauri_1966). The second prophage-like region (jCauriII)
is located directly adjacent to jCauriI and comprises 62
genes (cauri_1967 to cauri_2028) with a size of about
51.5 kb. Both prophage regions contain at their 3’ ends
genes encoding l repressor-like transcription regulators
(cauri_1965 and cauri_2027) and phage-related

integrases (cauri_1966 and cauri_2028). Almost all genes
of the prophage regions, with the exception of the regulatory genes, are encoded on the leading strand of the
left replichore of the C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975
chromosome (Fig. 1A). The size difference between both
prophage regions suggests that at least jCauriI is
incomplete and a defective remnant of a formerly active
corynephage.
Beside that, we detected with the CRISPRFinder program [29] an array of 98 clustered regularly interspaced
short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) and seven
CRISPR-associated (cas) genes (cauri_0899 to
cauri_0905) in the C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975 chromosome. The DNA repeats are 28 bp in length, separated by 33-bp spacers with variable nucleotide
sequences and similar to repeat units of CRISPRs from
C. jeikeium K411 [30], C. urealyticum DSM7109 [31]
and Nocardia farcinica IFM 10152 [32]. CRISPR arrays
and associated cas genes may provide acquired immunity against bacteriophages and other foreign genetic
elements, with a specificity that is determined by
sequence similarities between the spacers and foreign
DNA sequences [33,34].

Specific features of the carbohydrate metabolism of C.
aurimucosum ATCC 700975: catabolism of aromatic
amines and utilization of L-tartrate

The metabolic analysis of the C. aurimucosum ATCC
700975 genome was performed with the computer program CARMEN that provided an automatic mapping of
genome annotations on manually curated metabolic
pathway maps [35]. These data were combined with
results from a comparative genomics approach performed with the bioinformatics tool EDGAR, resulting
in the detection of orthologous genes in different corynebacterial genomes and their classification as core
genes or species-specific genes, so-called singletons [36].
A comparison of the gene content of pathogenic corynebacteria revealed a putative core genome consisting of
1,048 genes that are common in C. aurimucosum, C.
diphtheriae, C. jeikeium, C. urealyticum, and C. kroppenstedtii. This value is very similar to data deduced previously from the comparison of gene contents in
pathogenic and non-pathogenic corynebacteria [26,30].
The comparative genome analysis with EDGAR revealed
also that C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975 contains 443
genes that are specific for this chromosome. The functional evaluation of the detected singletons provided
characteristic features of the metabolism and lifestyle of
C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975 that are described in
more detail below. As the specific gene repertoire of a
bacterium should in principle be shaped by the environmental conditions in the natural habitat and as we
observed similarities to the gene repertoire of gut
microbes, the annotation data point towards the human
gut as a natural source for C. aurimucosum strains,
which is consistent with the recent single report of a
detection of this organism in a human fecal sample [37].
Analysis of the central carbohydrate metabolism of C.
aurimucosum ATCC 700975 revealed the complete gene
set for glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway
(Fig. 4). The chromosome of C. aurimucosum ATCC
700975 provides a phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase
(pck) and a fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (pfkB) function
for gluconeogenesis. The anaplerotic reaction of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle is mediated by pyruvate carboxylase (pyc). In contrast to other sequenced
pathogenic corynebacteria that all lack the sucCD genes
coding for succinyl-CoA synthetase, the TCA cycle of C.
aurimucosum ATCC 700975 is complete (Fig. 4). It has
been suggested that a putative succinyl-CoA:CoA transferase encoded by the cat1 gene can replace the missing
succinyl-CoA synthetase activity in pathogenic corynebacteria [30,38]. Besides sucCD (cauri_2063 and
cauri_2062), the C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975 chromosome also carries the respective cat1 gene
(cauri_2148). On the other hand, the C. aurimucosum
ATCC 700975 genome lacks the aceAB genes for the

Page 6 of 16

glyoxylate bypass within the TCA cycle. The lack of
aceAB was previously also observed in the genome
sequence of C. diphtheriae NCTC 13129 [38].
The functional analysis of singletons in the C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975 genome sequence resulted in the
detection of a distinct gene cluster for the uptake and
degradation of aromatic amines (cauri_2491 to
cauri_2501) (Fig. 4; Fig. 5A). C. aurimucosum ATCC
700975 can apparently take up aromatic amines by a
specific permease encoded by hpaX. The subsequent
transformation into ammonia and the corresponding
aromatic acid is catalyzed by amine oxidase (hpaY) and
phenylacetaldehyde dehydrogenase (padA). The resulting metabolite is converted into pyruvate and succinic
semialdehyde via the homoprotocatechuate (HPC)
meta-cleavage degradation route (Fig. 5A). The hpa
gene cluster encoding the respective enzymes of this
pathway consists of seven genes (hpaGLEDHI and
gabD2). The gabD2 gene is required for the enzymatic
dehydrogenation of succinic semialdehyde to succinate
that can enter the TCA cycle (Fig. 4). The hpaF function necessary to convert 5-carboxymethyl-2-hydroxymuconic acid (CHM) into 5-oxo-pent-3-ene-1,2,5-tricarboxylic acid (OPET) is encoded elsewhere in the C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975 chromosome (cauri_0890).
Two regulatory genes (hpaL and cauri_2492) are apparently involved in controlling the expression of the HPC
meta-cleavage pathway and the uptake and conversion
of aromatic amines. The hpa gene cluster of C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975 is similar to a previously reported
cluster for the uptake and degradation of aromatic acids
in E. coli [39] (Fig. 5A). Aromatic compounds may constitute a carbon source for gut microbes, as they are not
only abundant in soil and water, but are also present in
the gastrointestinal tract, where they mostly derive from
plant constituents. As the HPC 2,3-dioxygenase (HpaD)
requires molecular oxygen, utilization of the HPC metacleavage pathway is restricted to distinct intestinal habitats, for instance ones in close proximity to epithelial
cells, where oxygen molecules might pass from the
blood to the microbes attached to the epithelium [40].
Accordingly, C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975 is probably
able to utilize aromatic amines as carbon and energy
sources when living in an aerobic environment, such as
the peripheral areas of the human gut system.
Furthermore, the C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975
chromosome contains three singletons (cauri_2300 to
cauri_2302) that are involved in the uptake and degradation of L-tartrate (Fig. 4). Uptake of L-tartrate is
mediated by a tartrate/succinate antiporter encoded by
yflS. The subsequent degradation to oxaloacetate is catalyzed by an (oxygen-labile) L-tartrate dehydratase
(ttdAB). The respective gene cluster is homologous to
previously described genes from E. coli [41,42]. Tartaric

acid is found in many fruits and vegetables and is also a
product of microbial metabolism in the gut ecosystem
that enhances the ability of the normal gut microflora to
reduce the intestinal colonization by Salmonella species
and other enteropathogens [43]. L-tartrate is the most
widely distributed isomer and can be degraded under
aerobic and anaerobic conditions by a variety of bacteria
[41]. However, E. coli can utilize L-tartrate only as reducible substrate for supporting anaerobic growth on the
oxidizable co-substrate glycerol [41]. The C.

aurimucosum ATCC 700975 chromosome also encodes
a transporter for the uptake of glycerol (glpF) as well as
glycerol-3-phosphate (glpT), gluconate (gntP) and lactate
(lldT) transporters (Fig. 4). Furthermore, five genes coding for components of the bacterial phosphotransferase
system (PTS) and two additional enzyme II genes
(manP, nagE) encoding proteins of the fructose, glucose
and glucoside (sub)families of PTS permeases [44] were
identified in the chromosome of C. aurimucosum ATCC
700975 (Fig. 4). This gene repertoire, associated with the

Trost et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:91
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/91

central metabolism of C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975,
suggested that this bacterium is very flexible in the utilization of different carbon and energy sources, under
both aerobic and anaerobic growth conditions.
Specific features of the amino acid metabolism of C.
aurimucosum ATCC 700975: L-histidine catabolism and
utilization of selenocysteine in formate dehydrogenase

According to the genome annotation, all known pathways for the biosynthesis of standard proteinogenic
amino acids are present in the C. aurimucosum ATCC
700975 chromosome. The detection of singletons with
EDGAR revealed that C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975
encodes a complete histidine utilization (hut) pathway
for the conversion of histidine to glutamate (Fig. 5B).
Four gene products are directly involved in histidine catabolism: The first reaction is catalyzed by histidine
ammonia-lyase (hutH; cauri_1023), followed by the conversion of the resulting urocanate to 4-imidazolone-5propanoate via urocanate hydratase (hutU; cauri_1025).
The next catabolic step generates N-formimidoyl-L-glutamate by imidazolonepropionase (hutI; cauri_1026) that
is finally hydrolyzed into L-glutamate and formamide by
formimidoylglutamase (hutG; cauri_1019). Similar gene
regions are known from saprophytic bacteria, such as
Pseudomonas species, that take up and utilize L-histidine when growing in the plant environment [45,46]
(Fig. 5B).
Regarding the proposal of C. aurimucosum ATCC
700975 as urogenital pathogen in pregnant women, it is
interesting to note that the female histidine metabolism
is affected during pregnancy, resulting in the excretion
of large amounts of histidine in the urine [47,48]. Histidine excretion is largely dependent on the composition
of the diet and is generally higher during the second
half of gravidity [47]. Although little information regarding the utilization by bacteria of L-histidine from human
sources is available, the human gut microbe Fusobacterium varium was shown to use L-histidine as carbon
source for growth [49]. According to the presence of a
complete hut pathway, C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975
is apparently able to utilize L-histidine as carbon and/or
nitrogen source, which might be beneficial for bacterial
growth when colonizing the urogenital tract of pregnant
women.
Moreover, the C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975 chromosome contains the selABD genes and the tRNA Sec
gene selC for the synthesis of the twenty-first proteinogenic amino acid selenocysteine (Sec) and its incorporation into selenoproteins (Fig. 5C). Selenocysteine is
specifically incorporated into proteins by a cotranslational process that is directed by the UGA stop codon
and termed recoding [50]. The first step during selenocysteine synthesis requires esterification of L-serine to
the unique tRNASec by L-seryl-tRNA synthetase (serS,

Page 9 of 16

cauri_2392). The seryl-tRNA Sec is then converted to
selenocysteyl-tRNA Sec by selenocysteine synthetase
(selA, cauri_0967), using selenophosphate as selenium
donor, which in turn is synthesized by selenophosphate
synthetase (selD, cauri_0966). The anticodon of the specific tRNASec matches with an internal UGA stop codon
in mRNAs from selenoprotein genes [51]. Furthermore,
a specific elongation factor encoded by selB (cauri_0968)
is required to recognize SECIS (selenocysteine insertion
sequence) elements in the mRNA, such that the ribosome identifies the internal UGA stop codon as codon
for selenocysteine. Translation of selenoprotein mRNAs
then ends at the next in-frame stop codon to give a fullsize selenoprotein [50,51].
Interestingly, the fdnG and fdxH genes (cauri_0962
and cauri_0964) encoding subunits of a formate dehydrogenase are arranged in a cluster with coding regions
for the synthesis and incorporation of selenocysteine
(Fig. 5C). This gene order is highly conserved in bacterial genomes that code for the incorporation of selenocysteine into proteins. Formate dehydrogenase is a
heterogeneous group of enzymes that catalyze the
decomposition of formate to carbon dioxide and contribute to mixed acid fermentation. Some formate dehydrogenase enzymes can contain an intrinsic
selenocysteine residue [52]. The fdnG coding region of
C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975 includes an internal
UGA stop codon, suggesting that a formate dehydrogenase of the selenoenzyme type is encoded by this DNA
region. The C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975 chromosome carries an additional gene for a standard (thiol)
formate dehydrogenase (fdhD, cauri_0426) that is
located adjacent to a putative formate transporter gene
(cauri_0425). The utilization of the selenoenzyme form
of formate dehydrogenase may enhance the adaptability
of C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975 to changing environments, due to the strikingly different pH-dependence
when compared with thiol forms, with selenols being
active at much lower pH [53]. This biochemical feature
of selenoenzymes is remarkable when considering the
lifestyle of C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975, since acidophilic lactobacilli create a low-pH environment in the
human vagina by producing lactic acid [54].
Cell surface structures of C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975:
synthesis of a SpaH-type pilus and potential in biofilm
formation

The C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975 genome codes for
438 proteins containing predicted signal peptides for
either the general secretory (sec) or the twin-arginine
translocation (tat) pathway for protein secretion. Three
secreted proteins of C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975
showed homology to subunits of the adhesive SpaH
pilus from C. diphtheriae NCTC 13129 [55]. Adhesive
pili are covalently anchored to the corynebacterial cell

wall by a transpeptidylation mechanism, requiring a Cterminal sorting signal with a conserved LPXTG motif
[56], and can mediate the adherence to host tissues and
other bacterial cells [57]. The chromosome of C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975 contains two genes, srtD and
srtE (cauri_0189 and cauri_0190), encoding putative sortases involved in the assembly of a SpaH-like pilus. The
housekeeping sortase of C. aurimucosum ATCC 770975
is encoded elsewhere in the chromosome (srtB,
cauri_2420). The srtDE genes of C. aurimucosum ATCC
700975 are part of a DNA region also comprising the
spaHIG genes (cauri_0187, cauri_0188, cauri_0191) that
encode surface-anchored proteins with C-terminal sorting motifs (Fig. 6A). These proteins showed similarity to
fimbrial subunits from C. diphtheriae NCTC 13129
involved in the sortase-mediated formation of the SpaH
pilus [55]. The SpaH protein represents the major pilin
of this pilus type and, along with the minor pilin SpaI,
forms the pilus shaft, whereas the SpaG protein is
located at the tip of the pilus. According to the detected
homology between the corynebacterial SpaHIG proteins,
it is likely that C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975 expresses
an adhesive pilus with structural similarity to the SpaH
pilus of C. diphtheriae NCTC 13129 (Fig. 6B). This
pilus structure can mediate the initial adhesion of C.

aurimucosum ATCC 700975 to host tissues particularly
during vaginal infection and/or colonization [58].
Further analysis of the genome sequence revealed that
C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975 codes for a putative
accumulation-associated protein (aap, cauri_1006).
Bioinformatics analysis displayed five G5 domains within
the amino acid sequence of Aap that can mediate the
formation of biofilms by recognizing and binding to Nacetylglucosamines present in the peptidoglycan of the
bacterial cell wall [59]. Moreover, the C-terminal segment of Aap contains a sorting motif (LANTG) for
anchoring of the protein to the corynebacterial cell wall.
The secretion mechanism of Aap remains unknown, as
the protein is devoid of a typical signal peptide. The
Aap protein of C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975 is also
characterized by a C-terminal multiple repeat unit of six
amino acids (PDEPGK), the number of which may vary
among different isolates and during the course of an
infection, as described for members of the biofilm-associated protein (Bap) family [60,61]. Variations in the
Aap protein sequence may help the bacterium to evade
the immune response of the host, as observed in the
case of the alpha C protein of group B streptococci [62].
The Aap protein of C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975
shares structural similarity with the biofilm-associated

Trost et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:91
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/91

protein Bap of Staphylococcus aureus [63] and the accumulation-associated protein Aap of Staphylococcus epidermidis [64]. Both staphylococcal proteins are located
on the cell surface and implicated in the formation of
biofilms. Cell aggregation and biofilm formation by Aap
requires proteolytic processing of the protein by endogenous or host-derived proteases [64]. In the latter case,
host proteins can directly induce biofilm formation
upon infection, thereby enabling the pathogen to evade
the clearance by phagocytes. Both the Aap protein and
the SpaH-type pilus apparently represent prominent
protein factors on the surface of C. aurimucosum ATCC
700975 cells that are most likely involved in adhesion
and colonization processes and in the formation of
biofilms.
The gene repertoire of plasmid pET44827: synthesis of
the characteristic black pigment of C. aurimucosum ATCC
700975

Assembly of the C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975 genome sequence revealed the presence of the endogenous
plasmid pET44827 (Fig. 1C). The average G+C content
of 53.3% is below the value of 60.6% determined for the
C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975 chromosome, indicating
the acquisition of pET44827 by horizontal gene transfer.
Coding regions displaying amino acid sequence similarities with proteins of known functions and providing
information about structural features of pET44827 and
the physiological role of the deduced proteins are presented below.
Replication of pET44827 is presumably mediated by a
replication initiator protein of the IncW type (repW)
that showed 89% amino acid sequence identity to a
homologous counterpart on the multiresistance plasmid
pTP10 from C. striatum M82B [65]. This indicates that
pET44827 replicates by the theta mechanism, in contrast to other corynebacterial plasmids belonging to the
pNG2 family that replicate via the rolling-circle mode
[66]. Additionally, pET44827 encodes a putative resolvase (gcrR) ensuring the stability of the plasmid during
segregation. The putative resolvase of pET44827 contains a conserved N-terminal catalytic domain of the
serine recombinase family and a C-terminal DNA binding domain [67]. However, the gcrR gene region lacks
the typical DNA sequence repeats described for the
homologous resolvase gene of pTP10 from C. striatum
M82B [65]. Furthermore, pET44827 encodes a putative
relaxase encoded by traA with 52% similarity to the
relaxase of plasmid pREA400 from Rhodococcus erythropolis AN12 [68]. Two genes located upstream of traA
were identified as parA and parB, showing similarity to
class Ib plasmid partitioning genes present on the
pNG2-family plasmid pTET3 from C. glutamicum LP-6
[69]. Therefore, pET44827 seems to be an unusual corynebacterial plasmid that contains characteristic features

Page 11 of 16

of the pNG2 family that are combined with a replication
initiator protein of the IncW type.
The most prominent feature of pET44827 is a region
composed of five genes, including orf18 coding for a
putative non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) (Fig.
1C). The G+C content of the NRPS gene region is
about 47%, which is below the mean value detected for
pET44827 (Table 1). As the NRPS gene region is
flanked by a remnant of a transposase gene (tnpET23),
it might have been integrated into the backbone of
pET44827 by a transpositional recombination event.
The deduced gene product of orf18 shares 52% similarity with the single module type NRPS BpsA from Streptomyces lavendulae [70] and 51% similarity with the
NRPS IndC from the phytopathogen Erwinia chrysanthemi [71]. Both NRPSs catalyze the modular synthesis of the blue 3,3’-bipyridyl pigment indigoidine. The
predicted NRPS of pET44827 comprises ten of the eleven highly conserved amino acid sequence motifs of
NRPS proteins, only lacking a typical N-terminal condensation domain. Likewise, the IndC protein from E.
chrysanthemi does not contain a condensation domain,
suggesting that the final condensation step in pigment
synthesis is catalyzed by other proteins [71]. NRPSs are
key players in the synthesis of natural products and provide a modular assembly line by maintaining reaction
intermediates covalently bound on the same phosphopantetheine prosthetic group [72]. NRPSs are synthesized as apoforms, followed by activation through
phophospantetheinlytransfer to generate the holoenzyme. This activation might be mediated by the gene
products of orf19 and orf20, encoding a protein with a
phosphoribosyltransferase domain and a protein with
homology to phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase from
Syntrophus aciditrophicus [73], respectively. Moreover,
the NRPS gene region of plasmid pET44827 includes
the coding region orf17 with deduced amino acid
sequence similarity to IndA from Thermoanaerobacter
tengcongensis, representing an uncharacterized protein
involved in the pigment biosynthesis pathway of this
species [74]. Upstream of the NRPS gene region, plasmid pET44827 encodes a putative transcriptional regulator of the MarR protein family (orf21), showing 53%
similarity to the PecS regulatory protein from E. chrysanthemi [75]. Interestingly, the PecS protein is a global
regulator of various virulence factors and controls the
production of the extracellular blue pigment of E. chrysanthemi [75,76]. According to this annotation of
pET44827 genes, it is most likely that the characteristic
black pigment of C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975 is
synthesized by the concerted action of the NRPS
encoded by orf18 and an unknown condensase function
and that the black pigment molecule is relevant for the
proposed pathogenicity of C. aurimucosum.

Discussion
The annotation and bioinformatics analysis of the complete genome sequence of the clinical isolate C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975 (C. nigricans CN-1) provides
detailed insights into the metabolism and lifestyle of this
bacterium. The most prominent features of C. aurimucosum strains from female urogenital sources are the
unusual black pigmentation and their association with
complications during pregnancy [12,13]. Due to the
black pigmentation and other phenotypic characteristics,
these bacteria were initially named C. nigricans [14], but
were later shown to represent black-pigmented variants
of C. aurimucosum [12]. Annotation of the gene content
of C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975 revealed a cluster of
coding regions on plasmid pET44827 that is probably
involved in the synthesis of the black pigment. The protein encoded by orf18 showed similarity to the gene product of indC from the phytopathogenic bacterium E.
chrysanthemi [71]. The indC gene of E. chrysanthemi
codes for a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase that carries out the stepwise synthesis of the blue pigment indigoidine. Reverchon et al. demonstrated that the
production of indigoidine conferred an increased resistance to oxidative stress and enhanced the tolerance of
E. chrysanthemi cells to external hydrogen peroxide
[71]. The protection of the bacterial cells by indigoidine
is probably based on common chemical properties of
many pigment molecules that comprise several carbonate double bonds and can therefore act as efficient
radical scavengers [71,77]. This protective function of a
bacterial pigment might be relevant also for C. aurimucosum when colonizing the human vaginal tract.
The healthy human vaginal microflora is mostly dominated by acidophilic lactobacilli that play important
roles in preventing disease, such as bacterial vaginosis,
by creating a low-pH environment with a product of
their metabolism, lactic acid, and by producing hydrogen peroxide [54]. The synthesis of hydrogen peroxide
by lactobacilli provides a major protection mechanism
against opportunistic pathogens in the female genital
tract [78]. Hydrogen peroxide is toxic in two ways,
firstly by producing toxic hydroxyl radicals and secondly
by combining with the pool of chlorine ions in the
vagina to generate chloridium ions [79]. Hence, the
colonization of the female genital tract by C. aurimucosum may depend on the efficient protection against cellular damage induced by external hydrogen peroxide.
Although the genome of C. aurimucosum ATCC
700975 contains a standard gene repertoire for defense
against oxidative stress (including catalase, superoxide
dismutase and alkyl hydroperoxide reductase), efficient
protection of C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975 cells
against reactive oxygen species in the human vagina is

Page 12 of 16

additionally achieved by the synthesis of the typical
black pigment that might act as radical scavenger. The
location of the corresponding genes on plasmid
pET44827 explains why black-pigmented and non-pigmented C. aurimucosum strains were isolated from clinical specimens. Remarkably, only black-pigmented
strains were recovered from female genital sources,
pointing towards the pivotal role of pigmentation for
the colonization of the vaginal tract. However, when
considering complications during pregnancy, such as
bleeding, lactobacilli are less efficient in producing
hydrogen peroxide, causing increased alkaline conditions
in the vagina and thereby permitting the overgrowth of
pathogenic microbes [80]. It would be interesting to
screen non-pregnant women and sexually active men to
see if some of them are colonized with this bacterium.
Although Corynebacterium species appeared to be
present in the healthy human vaginal microflora
[78,81-83] and on the vaginal epithelium [84], C. aurimucosum was hitherto not detected in specimens from
the genital tract of healthy women. Which pathway of
vaginal, cervical and intrauterine infection by C. aurimucosum is therefore likely? Information regarding the
non-urogenital habitat of C. aurimucosum is currently
based on only three reports: (i) Three 16S rDNA
sequences were detected in specimens from the forearm
skin of a healthy male, indicating that C. aurimucosum
is part of the human skin biota [19]. (ii) A single 16S
rDNA sequence was reported in the prostate fluid from
a prostatitis patient [85]. (iii) An apparently pigmented
C. aurimucosum strain, originally named C. nigricans
AE1-3, was recovered from a fecal sample of a 35-yearold male Japanese volunteer [37]. This isolation of C.
aurimucosum from a fecal sample suggested that this
species (and its pigmented variants) may reside in the
human intestine. The specific metabolic features of C.
aurimucosum ATCC 700975 deduced from the annotation of detected singletons corroborate this microbiological observation. C. aurimucosum may therefore gain
access to the lower genital tract by contamination, followed by the so-called ascending pathway from the
vagina and cervix, which is the most common route of
intrauterine infections [80]. However, almost all of the
black-pigmented variants of C. aurimucosum have been
reported from urogenital sources suggesting that it may
be the primary niche for this potential pathogen. Indeed,
its capability to (i) attach to mucosal surfaces through
pili, (ii) make biofilms, and (iii) utilize aromatic compounds and L-histidine suggests that it is fully equipped
to invade vaginal mucosa. When viewed in the context
of its consistent isolation from pregnant women during
complications of pregnancy, it is reasonable to assume
that it plays an important role there.

Trost et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:91
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/91

In the gut ecosystem, aromatic amines and aromatic
acids can be a frequent carbon and energy source for
microbial growth when oxygen is available for the enzymatic ring cleavage reaction [39]. As oxygen molecules
are present in close proximity to epithelial cells, where
they pass from the blood through the epithelium, bacterial cells attached to the epithelium can assimilate
such molecules and can thus benefit from the presence
of oxygen [40]. The adherence of C. aurimucosum to
epithelial cells is apparently mediated by a pilus structure of the SpaH type, consisting of the major pilin
SpaH and the minor pilins SpaI and SpaG. Adherence
of C. diphtheriae to pharyngeal epithelial cells can be
mediated also by the minor pilin SpaB of the structurally related SpaABC pilus [57]. The SpaB protein is
covalently anchored to the cell wall to provide tight
contact between the bacterial cell and the host tissue in
the absence of a pilus shaft. Taking into consideration a
similar functioning of the SpaI subunit of the SpaH
pilus, adherence of C. aurimucosum cells to host tissue
may also occur in the absence of a pilus shaft. Adhesive
pili can mediate the initial contact to host cell receptors,
with cell-wall-linked pilins supporting the formation of
an intimate zone of adhesion. This close contact
between the bacterium and host cells enables additional
ligand-receptor interactions and, in the case of pathogenic interactions, the efficient delivery of virulence factors [58]. Furthermore, the adherence of C.
aurimucosum to epithelial cells may result in the formation of biofilms. The cross-linking of bacterial cells can
be mediated by the G5 domains of the accumulationassociated protein Aap that is encoded on the C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975 chromosome and can probably
interact with N-acetylglycosamine residues present in
the peptidoglycan of the bacterial cell wall [59].

Conclusions
The annotation of the gene repertoire provides the
attractive hypothesis to consider C. aurimucosum as
resident of the human gut system that manages to reach
the lower female genital tract and to establish in the
vaginal environment as a contaminant. The close proximity of the vagina to the rectum raises the possibility of
microbial colonization of the female genital tract in a
continuous process [86]. Another possibility is that
black-pigmented strains are sexually transmitted from
infected men to some women who engage in sex during
pregnancy. Indeed, a C. aurimucosum-like 16S rDNA
sequence has been reported from a prostatitis case [85].
Further studies are necessary to confirm if C. aurimucosum is frequently found in sexually active men. When
C. aurimucosum is equipped with appropriate protection
mechanisms against the vaginal hydrogen peroxide produced by acidophilic lactobacilli, it can apparently

establish in the vagina and cervix [11-13] and probably
ascend to the amniotic cavity and the fetus. Bacterial
infection by contamination is thereby followed by colonization that might cause distinct maternal or fetal
responses [79,87]. The results of the C. aurimucosum
genome project may help to clarify the proposed role of
this bacterium as urogenital pathogen in pregnant
women and to prevent preterm delivery that is a leading
cause of infant morbidity and mortality in the U.S.A.
and Europe [79]. If the clinical diagnosis of C. aurimucosum infection and medical intervention is timely, the
prognosis for pregnant women with urogenital infections caused by C. aurimucosum appears to be reasonably good, since several antibiotics turned out recently
to be useful for the treatment of infections caused by
this organism [88].

Methods
Bacterial strain and growth conditions

C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975 (DSM 44827, CCUG
48176, CIP 107436), formerly designated C. nigricans
CN-1 [10], was obtained as a lyophilized culture from
DSMZ (Braunschweig, Germany). The strain was originally isolated from the urogenital tract of a 34-year-old
woman who experienced a spontaneous abortion during
month six of pregnancy [10]. C. aurimucosum was routinely cultured on solid BYT complex medium [89] at 37°
C. For the preparation of genomic DNA samples, C.
aurimucosum was grown for 24 h in liquid BYT medium supplemented with 1.25% (w/v) glycine.
Sequencing of the C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975 genome

Genomic DNA of C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975 was
purified from 20-ml aliquots of an overnight culture by an
alkaline lysis procedure [90]. The published protocol was
sligthly modified as follows: (i) 20-ml aliquots of C. aurimucosum cells were incubated in a 30 mg ml-1 lysozyme
solution at 37°C for 1 h. (ii) The harvested cells were lysed
in 0.7 ml 10% (w/v) SDS solution at 37°C for 15 min. A
total of 5 μg of purified genomic DNA was used for constructing a single-stranded template DNA (sstDNA)
library. The concentration of the sstDNA library was
quantified by using the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit. Preparation of the sstDNA library and subsequent DNA
sequencing were performed according to manufacturer’s
protocols (Roche Applied Science). Pyrosequencing of C.
aurimucosum DNA was carried out with the Genome
Sequencer FLX System (Roche Applied Science). The
sequence reads were assembled with the GS Assembler
Software (Version 1.1.02). Using the default cutoff of 500
bases for the classification of contigs, 73 large contigs (≥
500 bases) and 40 small contigs were assembled to give a
total size of 2,744,972 bases.
A fosmid library with a 7-fold coverage of the C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975 genome was constructed in E.

coli EPI300 cells with the Copy Control Fosmid Library
Production Kit and the pCC1FOS fosmid vector (Biozym Scientific). Terminal insert sequences from fosmid
library clones were used to build a scaffold for the genome sequence assembly. The terminal insert sequences
and the assembled genomic contigs obtained by pyrosequencing were combined by means of the Consed program [15]. To close the remaining gaps in the C.
aurimucosum chromosome, additional Sanger reads
were generated on purified DNA of selected “linking
fosmids”. The assembled contigs of plasmid pET44827
were bridged by PCR products obtained with Phusion
DNA polymerase (Finnzymes) on genomic template
DNA. All primers used in this study were synthesized
by Eurofins MWG Operon.
Bioinformatics analysis and annotation of the genome
sequence

To verify the assembly of the C. aurimucosum ATCC
700975 genome sequence, the paired-end sequence
information obtained from fosmid clones was used to
generate a genomic map with the BACCardI program
[91]. Automated annotation of the C. aurimucosum genome sequence was carried out with the bacterial genome
annotation platform GenDB [16] as described earlier
[92], followed by manual curation. Proteins that are
orthologous in completely sequenced pathogenic corynebacteria, C. diphtheriae, C. jeikeium, C. urealyticum,
and C. kroppenstedtii [30,31,38,92], were deduced by
bidirectional best BLASTP hits [22]. Two proteins were
considered as orthologs if BLASTP matches with at
least 30% sequence identity and a minimum coverage of
50% of the query sequence length were detected in both
directions. The orthologous pair of proteins have to
represent additionally the best BLASTP hits for the
respective query sequence in the target genome. Genes
were added to the core genome of completely sequenced
pathogenic corynebacteria if orthologs of the encoded
proteins were detected in the complete set of selected
genomes. If none of the BLAST hits met the criteria
defined above in any other genome, the genes were classified as singletons (specific) for C. aurimucosum ATCC
700975. Gene content and comparative metabolic analyses were accomplished by the computer programs
EDGAR and CARMEN [35,36]. The annotated genome
sequence of C. aurimucosum ATCC 700975 was submitted to the GenBank/EMBL database with accession
numbers CP001601 (chromosome) and FM164414 (plasmid pET44827).
