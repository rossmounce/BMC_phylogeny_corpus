Abstract
Background: A prerequisite for a duplication to spread through and persist in a given population
is retaining expression of both gene copies. Yet changing a gene's dosage is frequently detrimental
to fitness. Consequently, dosage-sensitive genes are less likely to duplicate.
However, in cases where the level of gene product is controlled, via negative feedback, by its own
abundance, an increase in gene copy number can in principle be decoupled from an increase in
protein while both copies remain expressed. Using data from the transcriptional networks of E. coli
and S. cerevisiae, we test the hypothesis that genes under negative auto-regulation show enhanced
duplicability.
Results: Controlling for several known correlates of duplicability, we find no statistically significant
support in either E. coli or S. cerevisiae that transcription factors under negative auto-regulation hold
a duplicability advantage over transcription factors with no auto-regulation.
Conclusion: Based on the analysis of transcriptional networks in E. coli and S. cerevisiae, there is
no evidence that negative auto-regulation has contributed, on a genome-wide scale, to the
variability in gene family sizes in these species.

Background
Increasing a gene's dosage can have very different effects.
Occasionally, producing more of the same can confer a
selective advantage. For example, high copy numbers of
the gch1 gene are linked to resistance against antifolate
drugs in the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. As
individuals with elevated copy numbers are notably more
frequent in populations where these drugs are in use, this
suggests the action of natural selection [1]. On a genomewide level, duplicated isozymes in yeast show high retention rates, presumably because increased dosage facilitates
high enzymatic flux [2,3]. Frequently, however, radical

alterations to a gene's dosage are deleterious. Sopko et al.
(2006) systematically overexpressed individual genes in
yeast and discovered that growth phenotypes were measurably reduced for more than 700 (~15%) of the genes
tested. In some cases, the authors suggest, decreased fitness is likely owing to overexpression of genes that would
normally be expressed only periodically, such as genes
involved in the cell cycle [4]. Deleterious effects have also
been attributed to relative rather than absolute excess in
protein, a phenomenon known as dosage imbalance
[5,6].

Gene duplication and gene dosage
One process that can bring about instant, permanent, and
sometimes drastic increases in gene dosage is gene duplication. As suggested by the example of gch1 above, this
immediate, dosage-enhancing effect of duplication might
be what allows the duplicated gene to persist in the population and eventually rise to fixation. In fact, some degree
of expression initially after duplication seems a strong
prerequisite for a new duplicate to escape pseudogenization. If a gene fails to be expressed, there is little leverage
for selection to promote its retention.

Many genes, then, face conflicting requirements when it
comes to duplicating successfully: the new copy stands little chance of rising to fixation and being retained longterm, perhaps through acquiring new or subdividing old
functions, if it is not expressed. But being expressed alongside the old copy implies increased dosage, which is frequently deleterious. A possible genomic signature of this
problem can be witnessed in yeast where genes involved
in protein complexes, where changes in the expression of
one gene will alter dosage balance, have fewer duplicates
[5,7]. This is specifically the case for hetero-complexes (at
least two different types of subunits) whilst homo-complexes, where relative dosage should a priori not be an
issue, show duplicability comparable to monomers [8].
Homeostatic genes: Hypothesis
While some genes, then, may be caught up in the above
predicament, others might be uniquely placed to negotiate it, namely genes whose product level is controlled in a
homeostatic fashion. "Homeostatic" we take to mean any
situation where the abundance of a protein is regulated, in
a negative feedback loop, by the abundance of that same
protein. Critically, under this type of regulatory set-up an
increase in the number of active production units (gene
copies) does not inevitably lead to a net gain in product
(protein). Thus, when homeostatically controlled genes
duplicate, both copies can, theoretically, remain
expressed without incurring any potential costs associated
with altered dosage. Under this model, negative feedback
removes a potential barrier to duplication rather than necessarily providing an instant selective advantage that
might lead to fixation. However, this is not to say that
instant benefits may not exist. Having two functional copies of the same gene can, for example, lead to reduced
noise [9], a fitness benefit [10] that, interestingly, has also
been attributed to negative feedback regulation [11]. In
the longer term, a homeostatic set-up might allow for
rapid functional divergence of one copy without affecting
the function of the other. For example, if one copy
evolved to be expressed in a tissue-specific fashion, this
would not compromise the quantity of protein in other
tissues.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/193

Based on these considerations, it is worth asking whether,
other things equal, genes under homeostatic control
exhibit greater duplicability than comparable genes not
regulated via negative feedback. Below, we test this
hypothesis, using data from two well-studied microbial
organisms.
E. coli as a model system
One molecular system where negative feedback regulation
is common is the transcription network of E. coli [12,13].
Of >150 transcription factors (TFs) with experimentally
verified interactions, a large proportion (>50%) exhibit
regulation via negative feedback.

There is further cause to suggest the E. coli transcription
network may provide a suitable candidate system to
explore the issue of dosage-related differential duplicability. First, negative feedback in this system is exclusively via
auto-regulation, i.e. the TF directly represses its own transcription. In multi-layer feedback systems, on the other
hand, multiple components have to be transcribed and
translated successively before feedback can take effect.
Such multi-layer systems should incur greater time lags in
feedback, and hence a greater probability of protein production to overshoot target levels.
Second, several studies have previously identified TFs as
typically having low duplicability in comparison to other
gene ontology categories [4,14-16]. By contrast, Cosentino Lagomarsino et al. (2007) have noted that TFs with
negative auto-regulation are duplicated at ordinary rates
[17]. This is consistent with negative auto-regulation providing an escape route to duplication for TFs, which typically have a hard time duplicating successfully (outside of
whole-genome duplications, see e.g. [18]).
Finally, we already know duplicability to co-vary with a
number of gene attributes including a gene's dispensability [19], its level of connectedness in protein networks
[15,16], and its biochemical function [15,18,20,21].
Therefore, simply comparing TFs regulated via negative
feedback with the remainder of genes in the genome is
unlikely to yield meaningful insights so that identifying
an adequate control population must be a paramount
concern. Transcriptional networks provide a natural internal control group, i.e. we can compare TFs with negative
auto-regulation to TFs that are not controlled via negative
feedback. This excludes protein connectedness and biochemical function as potential confounding factors. We
thus decided to test the hypothesis that homeostatic regulation endows genes with enhanced duplicability by analysis of the E. coli transcription network.

based on surveying gene families in the extant E. coli
genome, it does not directly chart duplication dynamics
but rather amalgamates possibly quite different gain and
loss histories of individual gene families. However, for
genomes at equilibrium with regard to duplication activity this simple compound index should provide a good
approximation for long-term duplicability trends, particularly across larger groups of genes, which is what we are
dealing with. A more gene-centred way of assessing duplicability would be to trace individual gain/loss events
across an informative phylogeny. While it would certainly
be desirable to directly estimate duplication rates in this
manner, this approach comes with substantial added
complexity. For example, confident reconstruction of
duplication events on bacterial phylogenies is difficult in
the presence of ubiquitous lateral gene transfer (LGT, see
below). Furthermore, it is difficult to estimate what phylogenetic depth is required to both yield representative
trends across groups of genes and at the same time not
compromise the assumption that regulatory interactions
are relatively stable. We thus confine our analysis to the
simple yet informative gene group-centred measure of
duplicability.

Yeast as a model system
In testing a general evolutionary hypothesis, it is of course
optimal to analyze more than one model system. Next to
E. coli, the best-characterised transcription network is that
of the baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In contrast to
E. coli, however, considerably fewer cases of auto-regulation can be found in yeast [22]. Thus, while below we
report results for both E. coli and S. cerevisiae, any comparison of negatively auto-regulated to not auto-regulated
TFs in yeast necessarily suffers from low statistical power.

Results
No evidence for higher duplicability of negative autoregulators
To determine whether genes under homeostatic control
exhibit enhanced duplicability, we assessed duplication
patterns for genes in the transcription network of E. coli,
where a substantial proportion of TFs (>50%) show negative auto-regulation [12,13]. Our final dataset (see Methods) contains 155 TFs of which 62 are negative autoregulators. As the number of TFs with both positive and
negative auto-regulation ("dual") is limited (N = 9), we
focus on TFs with either positive or negative auto-regulation.

Comparing auto-regulators to TFs without auto-regulation we find no significant difference in duplicability
(Table 1, negative auto-regulators: Fisher's exact test P =
0.45; positive auto-regulators: P = 0.74). When we limit
our analysis to genes for which we can rule out, with reasonable confidence, that they entered the E. coli genome
via LGT, we recover very similar results (Table 2).

We employ the proportion of single-gene families
amongst all gene families represented in the respective
regulatory class (see Table 1) as our preferred measure of
duplicability. This binary distinction between single- and
multi-gene families has been widely used to characterize
differential duplicability between genes grouped according to a feature of interest [7,8,15,19]. As this measure is

The number of transcription factors belonging to gene families of size Family size = 1 (unduplicated) or Family size>1 (duplicated) are given by type
of auto-regulatory interaction. This table corresponds to Table 1 but transcription factors with prior evidence for lateral gene transfer (see
Methods) have been excluded. No internal comparison is significant at p < 0.05 using Fisher's exact tests.

TFs with and without auto-regulation might differ systematically with regard to known correlates of duplicability,
obscuring a potential contribution of regulatory type to
differential duplicability. We investigated several potential confounding factors.
Regulatory types do not differ in gene complexity
He and Zhang reported for yeast that genes retained after
duplication had, on average, longer protein sequences, a
greater number of functional domains and more cis-regulatory elements [23]. The authors suggest that this may be
because these genes provide greater scope for sub- and
subsequent neo-functionalization, so that selection
would have favoured their retention over less complex
genes. This argument is based on general evolutionary
dynamics rather than features specific to yeast, so that
similar biases may apply to E. coli. While we find no difference between duplicated and non-duplicated genes
across our limited TF sample (Mann-Whitney U P = 0.08),
more importantly, there are no significant differences in
protein length (all pairwise MWU P > 0.05) or in the
number of functional domains (all pairwise MWUs P >
0.05; ignoring domain repeats) between TFs of different
regulatory type (Figure 1A&1B). As the majority of genes
in E. coli are expressed as part of polycistronic transcripts,
gene-specific comparisons of cis-regulatory elements is
not possible.
Negative auto-regulators and TFs without auto-regulation
do not differ in operon structure
The fact that E. coli genes are frequently organized into
multi-gene operons might in and of itself be a confounding factor. In C. elegans, genes in operons exhibit reduced
duplicability compared to monocistronic genes [24,25].
The reasons for this remain essentially unresolved. However, part of the explanation might be that (inverted) tandem duplications of a gene inside an operon can disrupt
the structure of that operon [24], a mutational bias that
would also apply to bacteria.

As a precautionary measure, we thus decided to test
whether there are systematic differences in operon membership between auto-regulators and non-auto-regulators.

Consistent with results from C. elegans, duplicated TFs are
enriched in monocistronic transcription units (55.2% v
46.7%), albeit not significantly so (P = 0.34). Further,
there are no differences between negative auto-regulators
and TFs without auto-regulation (P = 0.48). Duplicated
positive auto-regulators on the other hand are significantly more likely to be part of polycistronic transcripts (P
= 0.0002; Figure 1C). Why this is the case is currently
unclear. However, this should reduce duplicability of positive auto-regulators whereas we find it to be nominally
higher (Table 1).
Regulatory types do not differ in under-wrapping
Finally, we explored whether genes from different regulatory types vary systematically in relation to under-wrapping. Under-wrapping quantifies the extent to which
hydrogen bonds at the protein backbone are accessible to
water and thus susceptible to hydration, which can jeopardize the structural integrity of the protein. The degree of
under-wrapping has been argued to serve as a proxy for
how reliant a protein is on binding partnerships to maintain its structural integrity ([26] and references therein). In
line with the dosage balance hypothesis, Liang and colleagues recently found highly under-wrapped proteins to
be, on average, less duplicable in E. coli as well as several
eukaryotic genomes [26]. This need not necessarily hold
true for individual genes. It has also been suggested that
poorly packed, disordered proteins may exhibit high conformational versatility and hence evolvability [27]. In as
far as under-wrapping captures such conformational flexibility, highly under-wrapped proteins may therefore
exhibit high duplicability in cases where duplicate retention is promoted through sub-/neofunctionalization
rather than dosage concerns. However, the results of Liang
et al. strongly suggest that, on a genome-wide level, the
effect of under-wrapping on duplicability is predominantly negative.

This is certainly evident for the TFs investigated here.
Across regulatory types, TFs of multi-gene families show
markedly reduced under-wrapping compared to singletons (median proportion of bonds under-wrapped in
duplicated genes: 15.84%; non-duplicated genes:

Known correlates of duplicability have no confounding effect
Known correlates of duplicability have no confounding effect. E. coli transcription factors under negative, positive or
no auto-regulation are compared with regard to (A) protein length, (B) the number of different protein domains, (C) the
number of genes present in the operon which they form part of, and (D) the proportion of under-wrapped residues, all of
which are known correlates of duplicability. There are no significant differences between negative auto-regulators and transcription factors without auto-regulation. The only significant difference between regulatory types is an enrichment of positive
auto-regulators in polycistronic (operon size >1) transcripts (P = 0.0002). See Table 1 and main text for sample sizes. AR: autoregulation.
28.46%, MWU P = 0.006). Higher under-wrapping for
singleton genes can also be observed within regulatory
categories (No auto-regulation: median proportion of
bonds under-wrapped in duplicated genes: 14.51%; nonduplicated genes: 28.46%, P = 0.042; negative auto-regulation: duplicated genes: 18.85%; non-duplicated genes:
33.58%, P = 0.098; positive auto-regulators were not analyzed further as under-wrapping information was available for only two genes). However, we find no significant
differences in under-wrapping characteristics between regulatory types (Figure 1D), suggesting that differences in

under-wrapping do not bias our assessment of duplicability.
No evidence for higher duplicability of negative autoregulators in yeast
To corroborate our findings, we repeated our analysis for
gene duplications in the transcription network of the yeast
S. cerevisiae. In contrast to E. coli, only 15% of yeast transcription factors (14 out of 112) are auto-regulatory [22].
As evident from Table 1, genes with negative auto-regulation show no evidence of higher duplicability (Fisher's

exact test P = 0.57). However, as sample size is severely
limited, only extreme differences in duplicability would
lead to a significant result in our data set. Due to the small
sample size, we also refrained from an analysis of potential confounding factors.

Discussion
We have argued that, a priori, genes under homeostatic
control might be expected to show greater duplicability
than genes without negative feedback regulation. This is
principally because negative feedback can decouple an
increase in functional production units (i.e., duplication
of actively transcribed genes) from an increase in product
(which can be detrimental to the organism because it disrupts absolute or relative dosage requirements). However,
we find little support for this hypothesis, neither in the
transcription network of E. coli, a system where negative
feedback regulation is common, nor in the transcription
network of S. cerevisiae: TFs under negative auto-regulation do not differ significantly from TFs without auto-regulation in terms of their duplicability. We note that, in
line with our hypothesis, duplicability is at least nominally higher for negative auto-regulators in E. coli (d =
0.71 vs. d = 0.61 in TFs without auto-regulation; see Table
1). Surprisingly, the same is true for positive auto-regulators; however, genes subject to positive feedback control
might from the outset be considered unlikely candidates
to suffer from increased dosage.
The above analysis suggests that there is no duplicability
bias favouring negative auto-regulators. Several factors
might contribute to the absence of such an effect. Notably,
only genes for which dosage distortions would have negative fitness consequences may enhance their duplicability through negative auto-regulation. The findings of
Sopko and colleagues [4] suggest that only a moderate
proportion of genes may fall into this category. Inspecting
a sample of genes without prior information on whether
dosage alterations brought about by duplication would
indeed reduce fitness, then, we probably ought to assume
that only a minority stand to benefit from auto-regulation
in the first place. Furthermore, our model presupposes
that negative feedback regulation leads to post-duplication dosage below what is expected from the doubling of
gene copy number. However, negative feedback control is
never instantaneous, so that protein levels after initiation
of transcription can temporarily overshoot pre-duplication levels. Some genes might cope well with transiently
elevated protein levels, but for others the failure to reign
in protein levels even for a short period might be detrimental, further reducing the pool of genes that fit our
original model.
Alternatively, a duplicability bias may exist, yet we might
fail to detect it. Given the limited number of genes that

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/193

might stand to benefit from reigning in dosage, across all
genes, any signature of differential duplicability might be
subtle. Further, in E. coli, we observed tendencies towards
greater under-wrapping, as well as a significant enrichment in multi-gene operons, in both negative and positive
auto-regulators (Figure 1D&1C). These covariances might
further weaken an already weak signal, as they should
impede rather than facilitate duplicability.
Are the model systems adequate?
The E. coli transcription network offers some distinct
advantages as a model to investigate duplicability (autorepression; large number of negative auto-regulation
interactions; natural control group), but it also comes
with some severe caveats. For example, our analysis
assumes that regulatory interactions in the extant E. coli
genome reflect interactions at the time of duplication.
While Lagomarsino et al. (2007) found significant similarity in auto-regulation within TF families [17], this has
recently been suggested to largely result from convergent
evolution rather than conservation of ancestral regulation
[28]. A further notable complication arises from the
observation that family expansions are, to substantial
parts, owing to LGT [28,29]. Dosage-related concerns may
also influence the fate of LGT-derived paralogs, but
whether or not this is a relevant issue will critically depend
on how similar the transferred gene is to the resident gene
at both the sequence and the regulatory level. Although
our results hold when we exclude TFs derived from LGT,
sample sizes become rather small; thus, we are unlikely to
detect any effect even if there was one.

Our failure to find a statistically significant difference
between TFs with and without auto-regulation in S. cerevisiae may equally be owing to small sample size as the yeast
transcription network provides comparatively few examples of negative auto-regulation [22]. This is not to say
that, sample size issues aside, genomic analysis of duplicability in yeast does not have its own pitfalls. Most notably, S. cerevisiae [30], like many other genomes, is the
product of a whole-genome duplication (WGD). Our
hypothesis of a duplicability advantage for negative autoregulators, however, principally applies to smaller scale
duplications. For WGD duplicates, the reverse may be
true. Notably, genes involved in protein complexes have
been preferentially retained following WGD in Paramecium tetraurelia [31], and this has been interpreted as
selection on dosage balance: Genes involved in a single
protein complex experience proportional dosage
increases, and individual genes should thus be less likely
to be lost – they are stuck at the new dosage. Under this
scenario, genes with negative auto-regulation do not participate in the general dosage increase, and might thus not
be preferentially retained after a WGD event.

Alternative model systems
The above section highlights that the genome-level
impact, if any, of negative feedback on gene family evolution will strongly depend on the specific genome under
consideration. Further, where radical genomic transitions
such as WGDs are implicated, current genome composition may not be at equilibrium. As a corollary, extant patterns of duplicability need not be representative of the
forces driving family size evolution in the longer term. For
example, dosage sensitivity might provide a short-term
retention bias but be less important in long-term family
size evolution, as has been suggested for the genome of P.
tetraurelia [32]. Thus, convincingly establishing a feedback-duplicability link in genomic data will be non-trivial
and require intimate knowledge of the system under scrutiny.

Unfortunately, we know of no other systems equally or
better suited to investigate such a link. More suitable
model systems might be found in the transcription networks of higher eukaryotes; however, despite recent
progress (e.g. [33]), our knowledge about these networks
remains partial and biased towards developmental pathways.
Negative feedback loops are, of course, not restricted to
transcriptional networks. Lareau et al. (2007) found that
splice-regulatory proteins of the SR protein family in
mammals affect their own splicing pattern to generate isoforms that are subject to nonsense-mediated decay
(NMD), a negative auto-regulation circuit [34]. Yet making an argument for enhanced duplicability based on a
single gene family would be anecdotal at best. Another
candidate system comprises regulatory circuits involving
microRNAs, which have been identified as frequently
homeostatic in nature [35,36]. In as far as regulation by
microRNAs serves as a marker for genes partially under
homeostatic control, we would expect microRNA-regulated genes to enjoy some duplicability advantage. It is
intriguing to note in this regard that mammalian duplicates have recently been reported to harbor more microRNA target sites and be regulated, on average, by more
microRNA species than their singleton counterparts [37].
Evidently, this is by no means conclusive support for a
dosage-related duplicability bias. Further, as repression
mediated by microRNAs is typically weak [38], so that
post-duplication dosage is likely to be above ancestral levels, duplicability biases might be rather subtle.

Conclusion
We have argued that negative feedback regulation can
decouple increases in gene copy number (via duplication)
from an increase in the product of that gene and therefore
equip genes with a duplicability advantage. We find no
support for differential duplicability owing to regulatory

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/193

set-up in the transcriptional networks of either E. coli or S.
cerevisiae. While these model systems suffer from specific
shortcomings that might affect conclusions, we suggest it
best to suppose, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that there is no link between negative auto-regulation and duplicability as far as shaping genome-wide
differences in gene family size is concerned.

Methods
E. coli regulatory network
Regulatory interactions in the E. coli K12 transcriptional
network and operon structures were obtained from RegulonDB 6.2 [13,39]. TFs were grouped into four regulatory
types: those with "no auto-regulation" (N = 70), "negative
auto-regulation" (N = 64), "positive auto-regulation" (N =
26), and "dual auto-regulation" (N = 9, where both positive and negative auto-regulation have been reported)
based on their annotation in RegulonDB. Groupings are
mutually exclusive. TFs that were not explicitly called
"dual" in RegulonDB but annotated with both autorepressive and auto-activating interactions (N = 2) in the
same resource were assigned to the "dual" class.
E. coli gene duplications
Sequence information for all protein-coding genes in the
E. coli K12 genome was extracted from genomic sequence
downloaded via NCBI Entrez (NC_000913) using custom
Tcl/Tk scripts. This information was used to compute gene
lengths (see "Regulatory types do not differ in gene complexity").

Homologous relationships between genes are typically
inferred using primary (nucleotide or protein) sequence
information. However, as sequences diverge from each
other over time, one might fail to detect homology
between anciently diverged paralogs and falsely assign
these genes to unrelated gene families. As the structure of
a protein is more conserved than its sequence, assigning
gene family membership based on structural homology
affords greater resolution of homologous relationships
for older duplicates. In addition, defining gene families
based on features of demonstrable functionality
(domains) should provide a more functionally cohesive
grouping compared to assigning genes to families based
on often rather arbitrary sequence similarity cut-offs. As
one might expect, gene family partitions are more inclusive than those based on primary sequence, and hence
more conservative in identifying single-gene families [40].
We therefore adopted an approach taken by Teichmann
and Babu [40] to detect homologous relationships
amongst E. coli genes. For each protein-coding gene in the
E. coli genome, we screened the SUPERFAMILY database
[41,42] of protein domains for significant domain hits.
Following Teichmann and Babu we refer to the ordered
array of domains, from the amino to the carboxyl termi-

nus of the polypeptide chain, as the domain architecture
of the protein. Genes that share the same domain architecture (ignoring domain repeats and gaps) we considered to
be derived from a common ancestor and hence members
of the same gene family, i.e. duplicates. Conversely, genes
with a unique domain architecture were considered to
have no recognizable paralogs and thus to constitute single-gene families. The SUPERFAMILY database is fundamentally based on domain classifications from the SCOP
database, which classifies domains at three levels of hierarchy: family, superfamily, and fold. Domains that belong
to the same family share clear sequence similarities. The
superfamily is more inclusive and can thus contain
domains where sequence similarity is reduced but where
there is still structural or functional evidence for common
evolutionary descent. Finally, superfamilies clustered
together at the fold level share the same broad-scale secondary structure and chain topology but no clear evolutionary relationship is evident. We thus assigned domains
at both the family and superfamily level. Results are qualitatively identical and we therefore only present data for
the "family" level. As the absence of a recognizable
domain does not by itself imply that the gene in question
has no paralogs, we restricted our analysis to genes with at
least one significant domain hit (>90% of TFs), leaving 9,
62, 24, and 60 TFs with dual, negative, positive, and without auto-regulation, respectively (see Table 1 and Additional file 1). Treating genes without domain hits as
singletons does not alter our conclusions. Note that for
the purpose of this study identification of duplicate relationships beyond the family level is not required as we differentiate only between genes in single-gene families and
those in multi-gene families.
Potential confounding factors in E. coli
Data on protein under-wrapping was taken from Supplementary Table One of Liang et al. [27]. As computation of
under-wrapping requires information on the structure of
the protein concerned, we could assign under-wrapping
coefficients only to a subset of TFs (N = 47).

Data on horizontal gene transfers was taken from [43].
Briefly, this data reflects the most parsimonious scenario
of gene gains and losses across the tree of 21 proteobacteria, with relative penalties for gains and losses of 2:1 and
using the DELTRAN algorithm implemented in PAUP*.
S. cerevisiae transcription network
The transcription network of S. cerevisiae was obtained
from refs. [22,44]. Genes in the network were classified
into the same four categories as for the E. coli network.
There are only a small number of TFs that exhibit positive
(N = 10) and negative (N = 4) auto-regulation. The 'dual
auto-regulation' class for yeast is empty and the remaining
112 TFs show no evidence for auto-regulation.

S. cerevisiae gene duplications
Sequence information for S. cerevisiae was taken from
[45]. In contrast to E. coli, a substantial proportion
(~40%) of TFs in this study curiously do not have a significant domain hit in the SUPERFAMILY database. As discussed above, absence of a recognizable domain does not
by itself imply that the gene in question has no paralogs.
Eliminating these cases, as done for E. coli, however,
would have severely reduced an already small sample. We
thus decided to define gene families in S. cerevisiae based
on sequence similarity. We identified gene pairs with similar sequences using an all-against-all blast analysis of S.
cerevisiae proteins. Protein pairs with blast e-value < 10-10
and an alignment length of at least 150 amino acids were
regarded as duplicates.

It is not the case that, in the context of this analysis,
homology inference by sequence comparison is adequate
in yeast but not E. coli. We persist with the structural
homology method for E. coli because we consider it superior and, in contrast to yeast, the widespread availability
of significant domain hits allows us to go down that route
without losing an appreciable amount of data.

and S. cerevisiae alongside relevant characteristics see
