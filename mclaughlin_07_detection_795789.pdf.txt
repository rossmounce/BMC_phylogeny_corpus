Abstract
Background: Protein domains coordinate to perform multifaceted cellular functions, and domain
combinations serve as the functional building blocks of the cell. The available methods to identify
functional domain combinations are limited in their scope, e.g. to the identification of combinations
falling within individual proteins or within specific regions in a translated genome. Further effort is
needed to identify groups of domains that span across two or more proteins and are linked by a
cooperative function. Such functional domain combinations can be useful for protein annotation.
Results: Using a new computational method, we have identified 114 groups of domains, referred
to as domain assembly units (DASSEM units), in the proteome of budding yeast Saccharomyces
cerevisiae. The units participate in many important cellular processes such as transcription
regulation, translation initiation, and mRNA splicing. Within the units the domains were found to
function in a cooperative manner; and each domain contributed to a different aspect of the unit's
overall function. The member domains of DASSEM units were found to be significantly enriched
among proteins contained in transcription modules, defined as genes sharing similar expression
profiles and presumably similar functions. The observation further confirmed the functional
coherence of DASSEM units. The functional linkages of units were found in both functionally
characterized and uncharacterized proteins, which enabled the assessment of protein function
based on domain composition.
Conclusion: A new computational method was developed to identify groups of domains that are
linked by a common function in the proteome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These groups can either
lie within individual proteins or span across different proteins. We propose that the functional
linkages among the domains within the DASSEM units can be used as a non-homology based tool
to annotate uncharacterized proteins.

Background
Protein domains are sequential, structural, and functional
units [1]. They perform and regulate catalysis, provide
structural building blocks, and/or act as interaction medi-

ators that link together cellular pathways. Protein
domains can also be combined together to perform multifaceted functions [2-6]. For example, a DNA-binding
domain can be combined with a dimerization domain to

allow for cooperative DNA-binding [7]; and the SH2,
SH3, and kinase domains can be combined to facilitate
signal transduction [8]. A protein can be better characterized by the function of its domain combination rather
than the functions of its individual domains. That deduction has been corroborated by the observation that function is better conserved across multi-domain proteins
than across single domain proteins [9].
There are a variety of methods available for the identification of functional domain combinations based on protein
sequence information, and these methods vary in both
the scope of the combinations identified and in their
applications. As examples, domain combinations can be
identified by finding domain fusion pairs [10,11], prevalently co-occurring protein domains within individual
protein sequences [12], densely interconnected domains
within the protein domain networks [6,13], and domains
that co-occur along particular stretches of the translated
genome [14]. The methods can therefore be limited to the
identification of combinations that occur within individual proteins, within a densely linked domain network, or
within particular genomic regions (see Discussion for
details). Further effort is needed to automatically identify
groups of domains that perform particular cellular functions and automatically provide annotation to these
groups.
For the present study, a systematic method was developed
to automatically identify functionally coherent groups of
protein domains, referred to as domain assembly units or
DASSEM units, and their corresponding functions. The
method employed a soft-margin clustering technique that
was guided by singular value decomposition (SVD). SVD
is often used to capture the significant variance in a large
dataset, and here it was used to retrieve the highly prevalent domain combinations found in an adjacency matrix
of proteins versus domains. The prevalent domain combinations were clustered such that, when necessary, a
domain was assigned to multiple groups in order to reflect
the fact it can participate in different functions. Note that
the clustering method is similar in spirit to the fuzzy kmeans clustering method used for the extraction of coherent expression patterns from microarray experiments [15].
The current method was applied to the protein/domain
complement of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and 114 functionally coherent groups of domains, referred to as
domain assembly units (DASSEM units), were identified.
The functions of the units included a broad range of cellular tasks such as chromatin modification, carbohydrate
transport, translation, and ubiquitin-dependent protein
catabolism. Within the units, the functional linkages
among the domains were demonstrated in three ways.
First, there was a significant enrichment of Gene Ontology

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/390

(GO) terms in proteins contributing domains to the units,
which suggested that the domains were used in a functionally coherent manner. Second, the domains of
DASSEM units were shown by manual review to be utilized in a rational way to facilitate particular cellular processes. Third, DASSEM units overlapped significantly with
transcription modules, defined as groups of genes that
share the same expression pattern under a set of cellular
conditions. Such overlap further confirmed the functional
coherence of DASSEM units.
We found that the functional linkages within DASSEM
units can allow for the prediction of protein function
based on domain composition. Since the transfer of annotation from a DASSEM unit to a protein of unknown function does not require high sequence homology between
the unknown protein and an annotated one [16], the
method can be regarded as a non-homology-based
method for functional annotation [17,18]. Non-homology based methods for protein functional annotation
include phylogenetic profiling [19-21], chromosome
proximity [22,23], text mining [24,25], domain fusion
pairs analysis [11,26,27], and combination of these predictors such as mRNA co-expression and phylogenetic
profiling [28]. Databases and annotation tools such as
Prolinks [29], STRING [30], and Predictome provide an
consolidation of methods for predicting the function of a
protein using non-homology-based methods [26]. These
methods have the property that a protein of unknown
function can be annotated based on its biological context.
i.e. how it relates to proteins of known function [16,31].
In a conceptually similar way, the DASSEM unit provides
functional annotation by placing a protein in the context
of domain combination that has been functionally characterized. DASSEM units thereby provide an additional
means to predict protein function. Also, the annotation of
DASSEM units can partially overcome the inaccuracy or
incomplete annotation of individual domains.

Results
Derivation of domain assembly units
A domain assembly unit can be viewed as a group of
domains that are linked together by domain fusion events
or events that cause domains that function together to be
placed in the same protein. For example, if domain A is
fused with domain B in one protein while domain B is
fused with domain C in a second protein, domains A and
C can be functionally linked. If multiple instances are
found where A is fused to B and B is fused to C, the functional inference between A and C can be strengthened,
and as a consequence the two proteins containing
domains A and C can be found to participate in the same
biological process (see below for examples). The cycle can
continue with more domain fusions and lead to a larger

group of functionally linked domains/proteins. These
groups are required for higher order cellular functions.
Shown in Figure 1 is an illustration of how an example
DASSEM unit was identified and annotated. The first step
was to find an initial set of domain combinations that are
prevalent in the adjacency matrix of proteins versus
domains, which are circled. These prevalent domain combinations are then spliced together through a series of
domain fusions. In the example, three domains were
pieced together by two different domain fusion events.
FHA was found fused to FH and also to the kinase
domain, and these two domain fusions forged a functional linkage between the FH and kinase domains. The
three domains constituted a DASSEM unit, and proteins
were associated with the unit based on their domain composition (see Methods for details). The function of the
unit was derived by identifying the GO terms that were
enriched across all of the proteins associated with the unit
using the GO::TermFinder tool [32].

An illustration of the derivation of a DASSEM unit
and its functional annotation. For the group of proteins
shown, there are three prevalent domain compositions
within individual proteins (circled). The domain fusions of
these prevalent domain compositions were used to link
three domains and to create a DASSEM unit that contains
the fork head (FH) domain, the fork head associated (FHA)
domain and the kinase domain. The overall function of the
DASSEM unit was obtained by finding the GO terms that
were enriched across the proteins associated with the unit.
The GO term enrichment indicated that the unit participates
in the cell cycle. Schematics of domains and proteins were
taken from the Pfam database [89].

We derived 114 DASSEM units from the domain content
of protein sequences within the proteome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Shown in Table 1 are six example units; and
full lists of the units along with all their functional annotation are available online in the supplementary material
[33]. The number of domains per unit ranged from 1 to
11, and the average was 3.3. Twenty six of the units contained only one domain. These domains had a high prevalence in proteins but a relatively low degree of cooccurrence with other domains. Although technically not
combinations, the annotation of these domains can provide insight into their function. An example is the
DASSEM unit which consists of the amino acid permease
domain [PFAM:PF00324]. All 22 proteins that contributed domains to the unit contain only this one domain,
which implies that the domain may not require a cooperation with any other domain or it may be too large (~500
amino acids) to be fused with other domains within a
protein sequence.
The functional annotation for each DASSEM unit was
automatically generated by finding the Gene Ontology
(GO) terms that were enriched (p-value < 0.05) across the
proteins associated with the unit (Figure 1) [32]. In order
to account for the fact that multiple tests were performed,
the Bonferroni correction was used when the p-values
were calculated [32,34]. All of the 114 DASSEM units were
found to have significantly enriched GO terms; and the
median top p-values of the annotations across all the
units was 7.7*10-7 for the GO term biological process category, 4.1*10-03 for the component category, 9.9*10-13 for
the molecular function category (see example DASSEM
units in Table 1).
Cooperative nature of domains within DASSEM units
The domains within the DASSEM units cooperate with
one another in order to achieve a particular function,
which was made apparent through an examination of the
functional roles of proteins associated with the units.
Three example DASSEM units are described in following
in order to show how such cooperation may occur.

The first example, DASSEM 1 in Table 1, participates in
the cell cycle and consists of three domains: fork head
associated (FHA) domain [PFAM:PF00498], the fork head
domain [PFAM:PF00250], and the protein kinase domain
[PFAM:PF00069]. The proteins associated with the unit
are listed in Figure 1. The proteins Fkh1 and Fkh2 are transcription factors that regulate expression of cell cycle
genes while Rad53 and Dun1 are cell cycle checkpoint regulators [35-37]. Transcription factor Fhl1 regulates the
gene expressions of ribosomal proteins, and multiple
genomic analyses have shown that it is also a cell cycle regulator [38,39]. Although Mek1 has not been shown to be
involved in cell cycle, it is a serine/threonine protein

Each domain assembly unit or DASSEM unit is described as a list of
Pfam domains and its GO term annotation. The terms which have the
most significant p-values for the GO categories of biological process
(P), cellular component (C), and molecular function (F), are shown for
each unit. The full lists of enriched GO terms are provided in a
companion website [33].

kinase required for meiotic recombination and normal
spore viability [40]. Among the rest of the proteins associated with the unit, as annotated in the Saccharomyces
Genome Database (SGD) [41,42], most of them also play
a role the cell cycle. Tos4 is a transcription factor that regulates genes expressed in G1/S phase of cell cycle. Far9
and Far10 are involved in pheromone induced cell cycle
arrest. Pml1 is required for nuclear retention of unspliced
pre-mRNAs. The YGL081W open reading frame is a hypothetical gene with unknown functions. If YGL081W is
confirmed to be a real gene, it is reasonable to predict that
it is involved in cell cycle based on the DASSEM unit's
function.
With regard to the cooperation of the domains of the unit,
they have been modeled to control the cell cycle progression through the G2/M phase [43]. Specifically the model
proposed that the phosphorylation of the protein Ndd1
by Cbl kinase allows it to bind to the FHA domain of the
protein Fkh2. The binding of Ndd1 facilitates an active
transcriptional complex formed between Ndd1, Fkh2
(which also contains the fork head DNA-binding
domain), and the protein MCM1. The model has been
confirmed by in a detailed study using phosphylation,
binding, and transcription assays [44]. Note that as shown
in Figure 1 the three domains of the DASSEM unit are not
all contained within a single protein, so the combination
can not be found by examining combinations that only
occur within individual protein sequences. Also, because
the protein kinase domain does not co-occur with FH
domain, a domain network clustering analysis did not
identify this domain combination since there is a low
clustering coefficient [6,13].
A second DASSEM unit example is involved in the process
of transcription regulation (p-value 8.13 × 10-17) and consists of four domains: the Fungal Zn(2)-Cys(6) binuclear
cluster domain [PFAM:PF00172], the Fungal specific transcription factor domain [PFAM:PF04082], the Gal4-like
dimerization domain [PFAM:PF03902], and the PAS
domain [PFAM:PF00989]. The first three domains are the
components of the GAL4 family transcription factors [45].
The binuclear cluster domain is relatively small and binds
zinc to provide high structural stability for DNA-recognition [46]. The transcription factor domain binds DNA in
a sequence specific manner [47], and the dimerization
domain provides an interface for dimerization via a leucine zipper so that two proteins can bind to DNA cooperatively [7]. The PAS domain is involved in sensing stimuli
such as the redox state of the cell [48], and can regulate
transcription factor activity by facilitating dimerization
[49]. The DASSEM unit implies a model of how the PAS
domain can regulate transcription: a conformational
change in the PAS domain induced by a change in redox
state of the cell can allow the PAS domain to facilitate

BMC Bioinformatics 2007, 8:390

dimerization of GAL4 like transcription factors, which
promotes the transcription of target genes.
A third example DASSEM unit combines domains of the
ABC transporter domain cassette with the 4Fe-4S binding
domain [PFAM:PF00037] and the metal-binding RNase L
inhibitor domain [PFAM:PF04068]. The domains of ABC
transporter cassette hydrolyzes ATP to facilitate the active
transport of allocrites (ions or small molecules) against
their concentration gradient through cellular membranes
[50]. When the cassette is used in conjunction with the
4Fe-4S binding domain, it transports iron into the cell for
the assembly of the 4Fe-4S cluster within the domain [51].
One of the functions of the 4Fe-4S cluster domain is to
detect oxidatively damaged DNA [52,53], and when it is
combined with the RNase L inhibitor domain, a role in
DNA/RNA metabolism has been proposed [54]. The
DASSEM unit pieces together a mechanism of iron transport and DNA repair: iron transport by an ABC transporter
cassette allows for the assembly of the 4Fe-4S cluster
which in turn lends DNA-binding capability to proteins
involved in oxidative repair of DNA.
DASSEM units are utilized in transcription modules
To further demonstrate the functional linkages among the
domains within the DASSEM units, the units were shown
to be utilized within transcription modules, defined as
groups of genes that share the same expression pattern
under a particular set of conditions and presumably have
coherent functions [55,56].

For each of the 86 transcription modules defined by
Ihmels et al., we first identified DASSEM units that contained domains also present in the module. A Venn diagram shows an example transcription module with the
DASSEM units that had the highest overlap scores (Figure
2) [57]. The diagram illustrates that the transcription
module engaged multiple DASSEM units to carry out the
process of amino acid biosynthesis, the primary biological
process associated with the module according to the
GO::TermFinder tool [32]. The DASSEM units that overlap with the module designate sub-processes that are
required for the overall process of amino acid biosynthesis. Unit 1 participates in aromatic carbon metabolism,
which is necessary for the synthesis of the aromatic amino
acids phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine. Unit 2 participates in sulfate assimilation, which is needed to synthesize the amino acids methionine and cysteine. Unit 3
participates in serine family amino acid biosynthesis. Unit
4 participates in ethanol metabolism which produces
pyruvate, a substrate used to make alanine. Unit 5 participates in the process of amino acid and derivative metabolism. The example indicates that DASSEM units are part
of a hierarchy of function where domains combine to perform the function of a DASSEM unit; and DASSEM units

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/390

are utilized to perform the subordinate functions of transcription modules. DASSEM units are therefore functional
parts, albeit sometimes small functional parts, of the
domain combinations found in transcription modules.
Note that the overlap score, as depicted in Figure 2, is the
fraction of domains in the module that are in common
with the DASSEM unit multiplied by the fraction of
domains in the DASSEM unit that are in common with
the module, which can more simply referred to as the
recall multiplied by precision. For unit 1 in the example
these values are 0.072 (recall) and 0.818 (precision).
Recall is usually very low as DASSEM units are parts of
modules.
To further demonstrate the overlap between of the
DASSEM units with the transcription modules, the
DASSEM units with the highest overlap scores with the
transcription modules were examined. The distribution of
the overlap scores for the highest overlapping DASSEM
units with the modules is shown in Figure 3, panel A and
the collective overlap of the highest five are shown in
panel B. Overlap scores between the DASSEM units and
the randomized modules are also shown. These rand-

respectively. Since each DASSEM unit contributes a distinct function, the result validates that multiple DASSEM
units can be engaged by a transcription module.

The difference in the overlap between the original versus
the randomized modules shown in Figure 3 was due in
part to the fact that the same proteins can be present in
both the transcription modules and the DASSEM units. A
statistic that compared the averages of these distributions
would therefore be confounded by that fact. To assess the
statistical significance of the difference in the overlap
scores, the overlap of the protein content between the
DASSEM units with the transcription modules versus the
randomized modules was also compared, for which the
randomized modules were generated by randomly redistributing the proteins across the modules. Shown in Figure 4 is a plot of the overlap scores of the DASSEM units
with the original modules (black) and the randomized
modules (white) using proteins as the overlap medium. A
Students t-test that compared the averages of the distributions was significant with a p-value of 4.6*10-3. The test
statistically validated that DASSEM units are utilized in
the transcription modules. Further, the test demonstrated
that DASSEM units represent a level of domain organization that can go beyond the level of protein domain architecture found with individual proteins. That is because the
average overlap scores would not be different between the
original versus the randomized set if the functional modules of the domain combinations did not extend beyond
individual proteins. Further, subsequent Student t-tests
that compared the second, third, fourth, and fifth
DASSEM units that overlapped with the transcription
modules versus the randomized modules were significant
with p-values of 2.9*10-3, 3.4*10-3, 3.6*10-3, and 4.6*10-

As illustrated in Figure 1, DASSEM units are formed by
splicing together prevalent domain combinations that are
formed by domain fusion events, and the proteins within
the DASSEM units are transitively related by one or more
domain. For a control analysis, the overlap scores of arbitrary groups of transitively related domains with the original versus the randomized transcription modules were
compared. To generate each of these transitively related
domain groups, protein pairs that had a least one domain
in common were found in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae
proteome, and all the domains within the pair were designated as a group of transitively related domains. 1,615
such groups were identified, and 114 of these were
selected so that they had the same number of domains as
the original DASSEM units. The overlap scores (using
domains as the overlap medium) of the DASSEM units
with the transcription modules was then compared to the
overlap of the transitively related domains with the transcription modules. The overlap was significantly higher
for the DASSEM units than the arbitrary chosen groups of
transitively related domains, and that result was validated
with five bootstrap samples taken, with replacement,
from set of transitively related groups of domains. The
result indicates that functional coherence was imparted in
the DASSEM units constructed from prevalent domain
combinations, and that coherence was higher than that
found for arbitrary groups of transitively related domains.

modules are given for before (black) and after (white) randomization of the proteins in the modules. The highest overlap scores, where one DASSEM unit was paired with each
transcription module, are shown. Student t-tests were used
to compare the average overlap scores of the DASSEM unit
with the original versus the randomized modules. The pvalue of a Student's t-test that compared the two averages
was significant at 0.004. Subsequent t-tests compared the
second, third, fourth, and fifth highest overlap scores
between the DASSEM units with the original or randomized
modules. Their p-values were also significant at 0.0029,
0.0033, 0.0036, and 0.046 respectively.

To further validate the functional coherence of the
DASSEM units, a comparison of the GO term enrichment
for the DASSEM units, the transcription modules and the
randomized modules was made. The number of terms
found below a p-value threshold of 0.05 with all GO term
categories were considered was 2295 for the DASSEM
units (median p-value 1.03*10-4), 3346 for the transcription modules (median p-value 9.62*10-5) and 240 for the
randomized modules (median p-value 1.2*10-2). The plot
shown in Figure 5 panel A shows the distributions of the
p-values for the DASSEM units, the transcription modules, and the random protein sets. Similar to the transcription modules, the p-values for DASSEM units were shifted
to lower (more significant) values when compared with
the GO terms enriched in the random modules. The levels
of the enriched GO terms within the GO hierarchy were
also similar between the DASSEM units and transcription
modules. The levels were deeper within the hierarchy
(more specific) for both the original modules and the
DASSEM units as compared with those of the randomized

DASSEM units can be used to annotate proteins of
unknown function
Given that the domains within DASSEM units function
together, we deduced that would they would be useful for
the annotation of uncharacterized proteins and for the
prediction of new functions of proteins (See Figure 6). We
reasoned that the more domains that a protein contains of
a particular DASSEM unit, the more likely that it was to
have the function of the unit. Among all of the proteins
associated with the 114 DASSEM units identified, 393
proteins had unknown functional characteristics based on
the GO annotation in SGD. We propose that the DASSEM
units provide a means to assess the functional characteristic of these proteins and provide a guide for further experimental testing.

In the following we manually review five example proteins and their functional predictions. For the examples,
the predictions were corroborated by evidence in the literature and by the identification of similar functional annotation for their interaction partners [58-60]. Note the
interaction partners were chosen that did not contain
domains of the DASSEM unit. If they did they may have
been used to derive the unit; and there would be a circular
argument. The analysis therefore provides independent
means of verifying the predicted annotation.
One example of the use of DASSEM units for annotation
is for the putative gene YBR025C. The protein product of
the gene has two domains MMR_HSR1 [PFAM:PF01926]
and DUF933 [PFAM:PF06071], and contributes domains
to the fourth DASSEM unit listed in Table 1. That unit is
annotated as having GTPase activity, being involved in the
process of ribosome-nucleus export, and localizing to
mitochondrion. Evidence that the YBR025C protein has
these functions comes from its interaction partners Sen15,
Dbp8, Rrp4 and Nup16. Sen15 is localized both to the
nuclear membrane and to mitochondrion [61,62], Dbp8
is involved in ribosome biogenesis [63], Rrp40 functions
in ribosome assembly [64], and Nup116 is a subunit of
the nuclear pore complex that allows for energy-dependent rRNA export from the nucleus [65].
The protein Fun30/YAL019W contains the Helicase C
domain [PFAM:PF00271] and the SNF2_N domain
[PFAM:PF00176]. Its associated unit (DASSEM unit 5 in
Table 1) has the function of ATPase activity, is involved in
the process of chromosome organization and biogenesis,
and is located in the chromatin remodeling complex. The
protein has no known function based on the SGD database [42]. Evidence that Fun30 functions in the chromatin
remodeling complex and has ATPase activity is that it has

Since the range of p-values was large, the second logarithm, i.e. the logarithm of the absolute value of the first logarithm, was plotted for ease of visualization. The plot indicates
that the number of GO terms and the values of the p-values were similar between the transcription modules and the DASSEM
units. In contrast, there were much less terms associated with random sets of proteins, and the p-values of these terms were
less significant. Panel B shows the levels of the GO terms within the GO hierarchy. For the transcription modules and the
DASSEM units the depths of the GO term levels were similar. In contrast, the terms for the random protein sets were distributed at the higher GO levels where the terms are less specific.

interaction partner of Fun30 is the origin replication complex ORC5, the protein complex that initiates replication
and is involved in chromatin silencing [68]. Fun30 also
has a genetic interaction with Swc3, a component of the
chromatin remodeling complex SWR1 [67].
A third example is the protein Stb4/YMR019W, which
contains the fungal specific transcription factor domain
[PFAM:PF04082] and Zn(2)-Cys(6) binuclear cluster
domain [PFAM:PF00172]. According to its associated
DASSEM unit (the second unit in the Table 1), the protein
is a putative transcriptional regulator. The GO term annotation for the process category in SGD is biological process
unknown. The Stb4 protein activates transcription in a
two hybrid assay without fusion to the Gal4p activation
domain [69]. Its interaction partners include TAF4 [70], a
subunit of the TFIID protein involved in RNA polymerase
II transcription initiation [71], and Sin3 which is part of a
histone deactylase complex that regulates transcription
[69,72]. The evidence from the literature suggests that
Stb4 is a transcription factor, which corroborates the
annotation made by the DASSEM unit.
A fourth example is Dug2, which implicated in small
nuclear RNA binding by a DASSEM unit. Such binding is
corroborated by the fact the one of its interaction partners
is Utp15, a small nuclear RNA binding protein [73,74].
The fifth example is the ORF YHL010C which, according
to a DASSEM unit, is involved in ubiquitin-dependent
protein catabolism. Additional evidence that the protein
product of YHL010C has that function comes from the

fact that it has remote homology (30% sequence identity)
to the human protein Brap2, a ubiquitin E3 ligase [75].

Discussion
From the analysis of the function linkages of DASSEM
units and their utilization in transcription modules, a
hierarchy of domain function was apparent. Domains
combine to form functional units defined as the DASSEM
units, and the DASSEM units are utilized together within
transcription modules. Since the domains of a DASSEM
unit can be contained within different proteins in a transcription module, DASSEM units represent a level of functional domain organization that goes beyond individual
proteins. That level is necessary to provide more comprehensive functions since individual proteins are limited to
contain approximately five domains [76].
The utilization of DASSEM units within transcription
modules is in agreement with the results of domain fusion
pair analysis [27], and extends those results. In the initial
studies of domain fusion on the genomic scale [10,11], a
functional linkage between two domains in separate proteins was implied when the two domains are contained
within the same protein in a different species. The
DASSEM units can be viewed as extended groups of
domains linked by successive domain fusions that
occurred throughout the evolutionary lineage of a single
species. Further, Marcotte et al. deduced that one reason
for domain fusion was to reduce the entropy of physical
dissociation, and thereby increase a functional association
[11]. In a similar way, a reduction in the entropy of physical dissociation of domains in DASSEM units may
increase their functional productivity.
The domain combinations of DASSEM units are unique in
different respects, and in the following some example
methods for deriving domain combinations are discussed
for comparison. One method is to identify domain pairs
or triplets enriched across different proteins, referred to as
supradomains [12]. DASSEM units correspond to some of
these supradomains, but can extend the combinations to
include more functionally linked domains. For example
one supradomain contains the translation domain and Ploop containing nucleotide triphosphate hydrolase
domain [3]. These domains correspond to the Pfam
domains GTP_EFTU protein synthesis factor domain
[PFAM:PF0009] and GTP_EFTU_D2 elongation factor TU
domain 2 [PFAM:PF03144] that are part of the sixth
DASSEM unit listed in Table 1. In total that DASSEM unit
consists of seven domains, of which six are contained
within the proteins IF-2, EF-TU, and EF-G. These three
proteins all bind to the same site on the ribosome [77].
Also, the LepA domain recently was shown to bind to the
same site on the ribosome and be involved in back translation [78]. Now all of the domains of the DASSEM unit

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/390

have been demonstrated to form a functional group that
bind to the same site on the ribosome. The DASSEM unit
was able to find more of that functional group since it is
not confined to domain combinations within individual
proteins, while all the domains of supradomains must lie
within an individual protein sequence.
A second method to find domain combinations is
through microsyntenies of domains, i.e. their co-occurrence in small regions of the genome, found through a
comparison of multiple genomes [14]. It was indicated
that these combinations, referred to as domain teams, are
suited for the analysis of prokaryotic genomes rather than
eukaryotic genomes. Further they require multiple
genomes to extract a functionally relevant group of
domains.
A third method to find domain combination is through
the study of domain networks. Each node in a domain
network represents a domain and an edge exists if two
domains co-occur within a protein [6,13]. The groups of
domains represented by the DASSEM units partially coincide with some of the clusters of domains within domain
networks, but there are differences due to the way they
were derived. The clusters from domain networks rely on
there being a relatively large clustering coefficient, i.e.
dense connections between domains within the group
and/or the same interaction network is present in multiple species. In contrast, the present method delineates
domain combinations found within a single species and
do not necessitate there being a relatively high number of
links from each domain to the rest of domains in the
group. An example DASSEM unit was described in Figure
1. The domain network approach does not identify the
combination because there is no co-occurrence of FH and
kinase domain (no edge between the two domains in the
domain network) [6,13]. Further, the present method
provides a flexible means of delineating a domain interaction network into functional segments. Since the present
algorithm is fuzzy in the sense that the same domain can
appear in different DASSEM units, it allows the network to
be segmented in a way that allows the same domains to
participate in different DASSEM units. That is necessary
since the same domain can participate in different functions [4]. The fuzzy assignment of domains was not
implemented in the domain network approach [6,13].
A concurrent study used The Discovery of All Significant
Substructure (DASS) algorithm to find combinations in
biological data [79]. The algorithm may be able to identify functionally linked domain combinations which are
similar to DASSEM units, depending on the level of significance chosen to ensure functional linkage of all the
domains in the group. Currently, the algorithm has been

Page 9 of 13

BMC Bioinformatics 2007, 8:390

applied to find domain combinations containing the SH2
and PDZ domains [79].
There are a number of limitations of the current analysis.
For example, the ability of DASSEM units to predict protein function of individual proteins was manual assessed
and requires further validation. That validation is complicated by the fact that the function of DASSEM units can be
distributed across more than one protein and may not yet
be annotated at the individual protein level. In addition,
for the current study a single proteome, Saccharomyces cerevisea, was analyzed; and that may limit the number of the
functional groups identified. However, the use of data
only from S. cerevisea ensured that relevant domain
groups were found and that these groups were not contaminated by outside domains.

Conclusion
A method was developed to identify groups of functionally linked domains. Knowledge of the groups furthers
our understanding of what domains are utilized in a cooperative manner to perform a variety of cellular tasks. The
groups can also provide a means to annotate uncharacterized proteins.

Methods
Data collection
The protein sequences and open reading frame (ORF) designations from proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae were
retrieved from the UniProt database [80], which consisted
of Swiss-Prot Release 47.6 and TrEMBL Release 30.6, both
having the time stamp of 02-Aug-2005. These flat files
were inserted into a MySQL database using a BioPerl module (Bio::SeqIO::swiss)[81]. An additional table contained
the Pfam annotations downloaded from the Pfam
resource [82]. An adjacency matrix, which is referred to as
the A matrix, was then created consisting of proteins versus domains: n = 3,781 proteins by m = 1,753 domains.
Within the matrix, if a protein contained one or more copies of a domain, the corresponding matrix entry was one,
otherwise it was zero. Each row vector of the A matrix lists
the domains contained by a protein and each column vector of the A matrix lists the proteins in which a domain is
present.
Identification of domain combinations by a SVD guided
clustering method
Each domain can be considered as a vector in the protein
space (each dimension is a protein) and the coordinates
of a domain in this space are decided by its occurrence in
each protein. A domain combination, referred to as
domain assembly unit (DASSEM unit) is a cluster of
domains in the protein space. Because of the large number
of proteins, identification of domain clusters in such a
high-dimension space is a challenge. We employed a soft-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/390

margin clustering method that was guided by singular
value decomposition (SVD) [83]. SVD is a widely used
spectral analysis technique to capture the significant variance of the data. The soft margin clustering method was
used so that each domain was assigned, if necessary, to
multiple DASSEM units to reflect the fact that a domain
may participate in different domain combinations to
deliver different functions.
SVD was performed on the A matrix using Matlab,
A = USVT,
where U (a n by n matrix) and VT (a m by m matrix, the
superscript T denotes the transposed matrix) are orthonormal, and S is a n by m diagonal matrix containing singular
values S11 > S22 > ...... > Smm, n > m. Analogous to the SVD
analyses on gene expression microarray data [84,85], the
T
ith row of VT, vi , is a linear combination of protein vec-

tors (rows of A matrix) and is called eigenprotein. The jth
T
T
element of vi , vij , is the coordinate of the jth domain of
T
the eigenprotein vi in the eigenprotein space. Corre-

spondingly, the jth column of U, u j , is a linear combination of all domain vectors (columns of A matrix) and is
called eigendomain. The ith element of u j , uij, is the coordinate of the ith protein of the eigendomain u j in the
eigendomain space. Since there are much more proteins
than domains, we chose to cluster proteins in the eigendomain space and then found the corresponding domain
clusters because this procedure is more robust than clustering domains directly in the eigenprotein space.
The proteins were clustered in the eigendomain space
using the K-means algorithm, and a mixture Gaussian
model was built upon these initial clusters in order to
assign proteins to multiple clusters [86]. For the K-means
step, we initialized the centroids of clusters as the following. Proteins were first clustered using only the first two
eigendomains, u1 and u2 . The initial centroids were randomly generated. The number of clusters K was adjusted
so that the K giving the maximum Calinski-Harabasz
(CH) index, a quantity which describes the degree of
inter-cluster separation and intra-cluster homogeneity
[87,88]. The obtained centroids and the optimal number
of clusters were used as the initial parameters for clustering the proteins in the space of u1 , u2 and u3 . The proPage 10 of 13

cedure was iterated until 135 eigendomains were used
and 114 clusters were found. Note that we selected the top
135 eigendomains for the clustering as the 135th singular
value was already quite small, and subsequent clusters
became unstable between the K-means and mixture Gaussian fitting steps, with some clusters being produced with
zero content.
After the K-means clustering step, each protein was
assigned to only one cluster. Since domains may participate in multiple combinations, it was important to allow
flexible assignment of proteins, and their corresponding
domains, to multiple clusters. We modeled each cluster
obtained from K-means using a Gaussian distribution,
centered at the centroid of the cluster. The variance of each
Gaussian distribution was determined by maximizing the
likelihood of the data,

where Nc is the number of domains that are in common

used to provide an overall measure the degree of functional utilization of a DASSEM unit within a transcription
module. It considers the degree to which the function of
the DASSEM unit is utilized and the degree to which the
function of the unit contributes to the module.
DASSEM units were ranked according to their overlap
scores for each module. From the highest ranking
DASSEM units, four DASSEM unit collections were generated for each module by combining the domains in units
ranked one and two, units ranked one through three,
units ranked one through four, and units ranked one
through five. The cumulative overlap score of each collection with each module was calculated. The process of finding overlapping DASSEM units and collections was done
for each of the 86 co-expression modules.

tor of the jth protein in the eigendomain space, x i and σi
are the mean and variance of the ith Gaussian distribution
respectively. The final assignment of a protein to a given
cluster was based on a threshold level of probability, set to
be within three standard deviations of the mean of the
cluster. A protein could thereby be assigned to multiple
clusters. The domain groups associated with the protein
clusters were found using the relation V = ATUS-1. These
domain groups were referred to as the domain assembly
units (DASSEM units). Functional annotation of each
DASSEM unit was found by applying the GO::TermFinder
tool to the list of proteins associated with the unit [32]. To
correct for multiple hypothesis testing, the Bonferroni correction was used when GO term enrichment p-values were
calculated [34].
Overlap between DASSEM units and transcription
modules
To show how DASSEM units were utilized, the content of
the units was compared to that found in groups of proteins in transcription modules. From a study by Imhels et
al., 86 transcription modules were obtained [55,56]. An
overlap score, OS, was calculated for each DASSEM unit
that contained domains overlapped with a given transcription module. The overlap score was the fraction of
domains within a DASSEM unit that are in common with

A randomization protocol was employed to compare the
average overlap scores for the highest overlapping
DASSEM units with the original modules versus random
sets of proteins. The random sets of proteins were created
by randomly redistributing the proteins among the transcription modules while keeping the number of proteins
in each module constant. Since the proteins were randomized, the domains within a given protein remained
together. Statistical significance of the overlap scores were
estimated by the p-values of Student's t-tests comparing
the average overlap scores of DASSEM units with the original transcription modules versus the random sets of proteins. The other control analyses were fully explained in
the results section.
