retrotransposons in lepidopteran genomes

Abstract
Background: Developing lepidopteran microsatellite DNA markers can be problematical, as markers often exhibit
multiple banding patterns and high frequencies of non-amplifying "null" alleles. Previous studies identified sequences
flanking simple sequence repeat (SSR) units that are shared among many lepidopteran species and can be grouped
into microsatellite-associated DNA families. These families are thought to be associated with unequal crossing-over
during DNA recombination or with transposable elements (TEs).
Results: We identified full-length lepidopteran non-LTR retrotransposable elements of the RTE clade in Heliconius
melpomene and Bombyx mori. These retroelements possess a single open reading frame encoding the Exonuclease/
Endonuclease/Phosphatase and the Reverse Transcriptase/nLTR domains, a 5' UTR (untranslated region), and an
extremely short 3' UTR that regularly consists of SSR units. Phylogenetic analysis supported previous suggestions of
horizontal transfer among unrelated groups of organisms, but the diversity of lepidopteran RTE elements appears due
to ancient divergence of ancestral elements rather than introgression by horizontal transfer. Similarity searches of
lepidopteran genomic sequences in GenBank identified partial RTE elements, usually consisting of the 3' terminal
region, in 29 species. Furthermore, we identified the C-terminal end of the Reverse Transcriptase/nLTR domain and the
associated 3' UTR in over 190 microsatellite markers from 22 lepidopteran species, accounting for 10% of the
lepidopteran microsatellites in GenBank. Occasional retrotransposition of autonomous elements, frequent
retrotransposition of 3' partial elements, and DNA replication slippage during retrotransposition offers a mechanistic
explanation for the association of SSRs with RTE elements in lepidopteran genomes.
Conclusions: Non-LTR retrotransposable elements of the RTE clade therefore join a diverse group of TEs as progenitors
of SSR units in various organisms. When microsatellites are isolated using standard SSR enrichment protocols and
primers designed at complementary repeated regions, amplification from multiple genomic sites can cause scoring
difficulties that compromise their utility as markers. Screening against RTE elements in the isolation procedure provides
one strategy for minimizing this problem.
Background
Microsatellite genetic markers are based on the properties of SSRs (simple sequence repeats) which are numerous and ubiquitous in the DNA of eukaryotes [1,2]. The
basic repeat unit of an SSR is generally considered to be
one to six bases long, and an array of two or more basic
units repeated in tandem constitutes the SSR. Such SSRs
are often miscopied by DNA polymerase, and the resulting high mutation rate, leading to a change in the number

of basic units in the array, has proven to be very useful for
population genetic studies. The high degree of polymorphism in the size of the tandem array can easily be visualized by gel-separation of PCR products generated by
primers placed in the flanking regions, on either side of
the SSR.
Another pattern of repetition, however, has proven to
be very troublesome in the practical application of microsatellite markers in some organisms, including the insect
order Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths). The regions
closely flanking one or both sides of the SSR may themselves be highly repeated, dispersed throughout the
genome rather than occurring tandemly [3,4]. Primers
designed to match these regions, therefore, may generate

multiple bands, or even fail to produce discrete visible
products because too many different sites are being
amplified. Unlike the internally-repeated patterns of the
SSRs, there is nothing obvious about the structure of
these repeated flanking regions. The fact that they are
repeated can be deduced only by comparisons among
many flanking sequences, not by any intrinsic pattern of
the sequence itself.
Meglécz et al. [5] first described families of similar
sequences flanking SSR repeats from two species of Lepidoptera, Parnassius apollo and Euphydryas aurinia.
These similarity patterns fall into two main types, if the
location of the SSR is taken into account but its sequence
and orientation is ignored. Unilateral repeat families
occur on one side only of the SSR, the other side is not
repeated (e.g. L1-SSR-R, L2-SSR-S, L3-SSR-T, etc.). In
bilateral repeat families, both flanking sides are repeated
(e.g. L1-SSR-R1, L2-SSR-R2, L3-SSR-R3, etc.). van't Hof et
al. [6] denoted these as asymmetric and symmetric families respectively, however these terms are misleading as
there is not necessarily any symmetry between L1 and R1,
L2 and R2, etc. These authors examined patterns of flanking SSR families in a third lepidopteran, Bicyclus anynana. Using blastn comparisons of these to sequences in
GenBank, they defined four "Lepidoptera Specific Core
Sequences" (LSCSs) that represented the common elements of four repeated flanking sequences.
The widespread occurrence of these LSCS regions can
complicate the use of microsatellite markers in population studies. For example, markers have been developed
for the polyphagous noctuid moth Helicoverpa armigera
by several groups [7-10]. Markers developed for populations of one region (e.g. China) typically have a low success rate in other regions (e.g. Australia). Studies of
Australian populations, even using microsatellites developed from those populations, have produced a highly
dynamic picture of temporal variation in migration patterns [11-14]. However, a careful re-examination of ten of
these markers by Endersby et al. [15] showed that a high
proportion of these loci showed allele drop-outs or were
not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, undermining their
reliability as accurate indicators of population structure.
Based on analysis of whole-genome sequences of several insects, including the lepidopteran Bombyx mori,
Meglécz et al. [16] showed there were large interspecific
differences in frequencies of microsatellites in insect
genomes. They confirmed and extended the observations
of shared flanking regions among independently isolated
sets of microsatellite markers from several different Lepidoptera. They demonstrated a statistical association
between SSRs and previously compiled datasets of
repeated DNA sequences in six Drosophila species and
Anopheles gambiae (a similar compilation for B. mori was
not provided). van't Hof et al. [6] also suggested a general

association between transposable elements (TEs) and
some of the LSCS regions. However, no specific class of
TEs was identified as contributing to the observed patterns.
Here we show that a class of non-LTR retrotransposons, RTE elements, are associated with SSR repeats in
Lepidoptera and other species. Full-length autonomous
elements have low copy numbers in the genome of Bombyx mori, however partial elements consisting of the coding sequence of the C-terminal end of the reverse
transcriptase protein immediately flanking an SSR are
highly abundant. Slippage during reverse transcription
and chromosomal integration can increase the number of
repeating units within the SSR. These numerous chromosomal integration events of partial elements have peppered the genome with ready-made SSRs flanking an
element-specific sequence. These events can account for
a substantial fraction of unilateral repeat families recovered in independent efforts from several lepidopteran
species.

Results
Identification of full-length RTE elements from Lepidoptera

The founding member of the RTE clade is the RTE-1 element from Caenorhabditis elegans [17,18]. We used its
deduced protein sequence (GenBank:AF054983) in
tblastn searches of Lepidopteran sequences in GenBank
(nr and wgs subsets). A full-length element that we have
named HmRTE-e01 sharing all the major features of RTE
elements was identified in BAC clone AEHM-22C5 from
Heliconius melpomene (GenBank:CU462842) (Figure 1).
The single open reading frame (ORF) of 990 amino acids
contains two conserved domains, an AP (apurinic) endonuclease domain and an RT (reverse transcriptase)
domain. Unlike some RTE elements, no skipped stop
codons or frameshifts are evident at the 5' end of the coding sequence. The AP endonuclease domain belongs to a
family of proteins (pfam03372, Exo_endo_phos, endonuclease/exonuclease/phosphatase family) that includes
magnesium dependent endonucleases as well as phosphatases involved in intracellular signalling. The RT
domain belongs to a family of proteins found in non-LTR
retrotransposons
and
retroviruses
(cd01650:
RT_nLTR_like) with activities that include RNA-directed
DNA polymerase, DNA-directed DNA polymerase and a
ribonuclease that degrades the RNA in a RNA:DNA
duplex (RNase H), although no RNase H domain was
found in this element. These RTs catalyze the conversion
of single-stranded RNA into double-stranded DNA for
integration into the host chromosomes. The 3' stop
codon (TAA) is immediately followed by a short 14 bp
3'UTR containing a (CTT)2CT SSR repeat. A 20 bp target-site duplication (TSD) sequence (AGTTTAAACGAAGTATATCT) immediately follows the (CTT)2CT

inserted in the minus strand of the BAC clone from nucleotide position 30,546 to 27,284. It has a single open reading frame that encodes a 990 amino
acid protein sequence. AP marks the Exonuclease/Endonuclease/Phosphatase domain and RT indicates the RT_nLTR_like domain. The element has
a 276 bp 5' untranslated region (UTR) and a 14 bp short 3' UTR that includes the (GAA)2GA simple repeat units represented by diagonal stripes. The
stop codon (TAA) located at 27,300 - 27,298 and is indicated by '*'. Immediately flanking the HmRTE-e01 element are two 20 bp target-site duplication

repeat units and also occurs at the 5' end of the element
prior to the 5'UTR. The TSD sequences are produced
when a staggered cut is made in the double-stranded
DNA prior to element insertion, and the two singlestranded regions flanking the new insert are filled in by
DNA polymerase [19-21]. The 20 bp TSD sequence can
be more easily identified through pairwise sequence
alignment between the AEHM-22C5 BAC clone (GenBank:CU462842) and the homologous BAC clone
AEHM-7G5 (GenBank:CU462858) that lacks the RTE
insertion. The comparison of these two BAC clones from
the same population of H. melpomene offers a rare opportunity to observe the pre- and post-insertion status of the
same genomic region. In the BAC clone AEHM-7G5 the
pre-insertion position of the HmRTE-e01 element is
between nucleotide positions 22,485 and 22,486, and the
20 bp sequence at 22,466 to 22,485 has become the TSD
on both sides of the element in AEHM-22C5. The insertion appears to be recent, as frameshifts and internal stop
codons commonly found in other RTE elements have not
accumulated, and the population is polymorphic for presence/absence of the element in this genomic locus.
The C. elegans RTE-1 sequence was also used to identify 25 full-length elements from the unannotated wholegenome shotgun contigs of B. mori (BmRTE-d01 through
-d25), the largest number of distinct RTE elements identified from a single species to date. These have the same
two conserved protein domains AP and RT, possess various SSR repeats in the short 3' UTR immediately following the stop codon at the end of the RT domain, and are
flanked by TSD sequences of differing lengths. Some of
the Bombyx elements possess an in-frame stop codon or a
frameshift within the first 200 bases of the coding
sequence, like other RTE elements. The partial RTE
sequence identified by Malik and Eickbush [17] next to

the cecropin B gene of B. mori is represented by the fulllength element BmRTE-d05, with some protein sequence
differences because of attempts of those authors to correct frameshifts that had been identified in the partial
sequence. Three partial RTE sequences identified by
Zupunski et al. [22] correspond to the full-length elements BmRTE-d07, -d24, and -d25. Using the full-length
Bombyx RTE elements as query sequences in blast
searches of the Bombyx genome contigs yields far more
hits of various lengths at the 3' end than at the 5' end, suggesting that the copy number of full-length functional
autonomous elements is generally low (around 2 to 4 copies per genome, but up to 16 and 22 copies for BmRTEd01 and BmRTE-d02 respectively, see Additional File 1),
in contrast to frequent insertions (up to 300 in the case of
BmRTE-d04) of partial non-autonomous elements with
intact 3' ends and flanking SSRs.
Relation of lepidopteran RTE elements to other non-LTR
retrotransposons

A phylogenetic analysis of the lepidopteran RTE elements
based on alignment against 220 amino acid residues of
the RT domain (domain CD01650 in the GenBank Conserved Domain Database) was conducted in comparison
with other RTE elements and more generally, other clades
of non-LTR retrotransposons (Figure 2). We follow the
definition of "clade" used by Malik et al. [23] to represent
those retroelements that (1) share the same structural
features, (2) are grouped together with ample phylogenetic support, and (3) date back to the Precambrian era.
Previously analyzed non-LTR retrotransposons [23] and
the B. mori CR1 non-LTR element within the CR1 clade
[24] were included, with members within the CRE clade
(i.e., CRE1, CRE2, CZAR and SLACS) as outgroups. All
of the lepidopteran RTE elements cluster together with

of non-LTR retrotransposable elements RT conserved domain from different clades as reported in Figure 3 of Malik et al. [23], and included also the
recently described B. mori non-LTR CR1B element of the CR1 clade [24]. The tree was constructed using the Neighbour Joining (NJ) method as described in Malik et al. [23] with the CRE element RT conserved domain as outgroups. The NJ tree is a 50% consensus tree, with bootstrap values of >70
from 2,000 bootstrap replications indicated at respective nodes. The RTE clade includes previously described RTE-1, RTE-2, JAM1 and BDDF [23] as well
as 25 newly identified elements from B. mori and one from H. melpomene. With the exception of BmCR1B which was obtained from [24], all amino acid
sequences from the RTE, R2, R4, L1, Jockey, CR1 and CRE clades of Malik et al. [23] were from their sequence alignment (EMBL:DS36752).

previously identified RTE elements (RTE-1, RTE-2,
BDDF, JAM1) into a single group with a bootstrap value
of 85%, placing these newly described lepidopteran elements within the RTE clade [23]. Two major sister groups
are evident, consistent with previous analysis [23], one
containing RTE-1 and RTE-2 from C. elegans and the
other JAM1 from the mosquito Aedes aegypti and BDDF
from the cow Bos taurus. A third minor sister group with
a more basal position contained three B. mori elements
(BmRTE-d13, -d15, -d17) and the H. melpomene element
HmRTE-e01.
We extended previous phylogenetic analyses of the RTE
subgroups using newly identified fish, molluscan, cnidarian, lizard, amphioxus and plant RTE elements (Additional File 2) as well as previously described nematode
RTE (RTE-1, RTE-2, [23]), Aedes JAM1 [23], Schistosoma
SR2 [32], Oryzias RTE [22], partial RTEs from Bombyx
[22], and plant RTE (Aegilops, Hordeum [22]). This indicates the BmRTE elements are highly divergent, being
distributed among the Caenorhabditis RTE, Bov-B LINE
and Animal RTE subgroups (Figure 3). From the phylogenetic analysis, elements within the RTE clade are grouped
into four subgroups of Plant/Animal RTE, Rex3/RTE,
Caenorhabditis RTE/Bombyx RTE, and Bov-B LINE/
Bombyx RTE (Figure 3). HmRTE-e01 and BmRTE-d13
are clustered within the animal RTEs, while BmRTE-d17
and Schistosoma SR2, and BmRTE-d14 and Aedes JAM1
are placed basal to the Rex3/RTE and Plant/Animal RTE
subgroups. The pattern of wide RTE diversity within Lepidoptera, and low similarity to other groups, suggests that
the main lineages of Bombyx RTE elements identified
here are ancient and not due to recent horizontal transfer
of elements from non-arthropod groups.
In contrast, the high similarity among Bov-B LINEs of
reptiles and mammals (V. ammodytes Bov-B LINE, Bos
taurus BDDF) could be explained by horizontal transfer,
as previously suggested by Zupunski et al. [22]. These
authors also inferred another instance of horizontal
transfer from arthropods to reptiles based on similarity
between Bov-B from V. ammodytes and other reptiles,
and partial sequences from B. mori they named Bombyx
Bov-B/RTE (equivalent to our full-length BmRTE-d24
and -d25). We found the reptile/mammal group to cluster
additionally with B. mori BmRTE-d05, -d06, -d12, and d16, but outside the other Bombyx elements, pointing to
this subgroup as the likely source of the horizontal transfer. As also pointed out by Zupunski et al. [22], horizontal
transfer between plant and fish RTE elements was also
evident (Figure 3), and the distribution of plant-like elements within fishes is wider than previously suspected, as
shown by the element we have identified from the hagfish
Eptatretus.

Lepidopteran RTE elements in public DNA databases

A few examples of partial RTE elements in non-coding
flanking sequences or introns of genes from Lepidoptera
have been deposited in public databases. Chen and Li
[25] looked for TEs neighbouring cytochrome P450 genes
in Helicoverpa zea, and recognized a partial RTE element
they named HzRTE-1 within the third intron of
CYP9A12v3 (GenBank:DQ788839). This partial element
was 1,754 bp long, flanked by 10 bp TSDs, encoded an RT
domain with 40% amino acid sequence identity to the C.
elegans RTE-1 (and 78% identity to the last 400 residues
of BmRTE-d01, Additional File 4), and was terminated by
a region of TGA trinucleotide repeats in the short 3'
UTR. Xu et al. [26] discovered genes with similarity to
delta-11 desaturases (GenBank:EF113398) implicated in
pheromone biosynthesis in Ostrinia nubilalis and O. furnacalis; each of which was adjacent to a partial RTE element with 78% amino acid identity to the C-terminal 473
residues of BmRTE-d08 (Additional Files 3 and 4). These
authors recognized the sequence similarity to the C. elegans RTE-1 element, but considered the partial elements
from Ostrinia to represent a new family which they
named ezi, although this Ostrinia family was clearly clustered within the RTE-1 clade in their phylogenetic analysis [26]. No SSRs were found in the 3' UTR of these
elements.
Other instances of lepidopteran sequences in GenBank
that we found have not been previously recognized as
RTE elements. These include two partial HzRTE-1-like
sequences (named HaRTE-t01; see Additional File 3)
within the first intron of two different alleles of a cadherin gene from H. armigera (GenBank:AY714875 and
AY714876) (Additional File 4, Figure 4). A 224 bp partial
HzRTE-1-like sequence was also found in the second
intron of the preproattacin A gene (GenBank:U46130) of
the noctuid moth Trichoplusia ni. In B. mori, RTE elements are common features of genes deposited in GenBank. For example, in the gDNA sequence for cuticle
protein genes BMWCP5 - BMWCP2 (GenBank:AB262389), two partial elements (a 442 bp with
97% identity to BmRTE-d09 over the last 137 amino
acids, and a 521 bp with 88% identity to BmRTE-d02 over
the last 144 amino acids) were identified, with both partial elements flanked by TSDs and (TGA)n SSR units at
the 3' UTR (Additional File 4, Figure 4). Other lepidopteran species with significant gDNA homology to
RTE elements (but not as microsatellite DNA loci)
included the prophenoloxidase-activating proteinase-1
gene from Manduca sexta (GenBank:AY789465), the
hemolymph storage protein 2 gene from Samia cynthia
(GenBank:AB288052), the farnesyl diphosphate synthase
gene
from
Choristoneura
fumiferana
(GenBank:AY962308), the arylphorin gene of Galleria mellonella (GenBank:M73793), a BAC clone from Heliconius

Neurospora group II intron (RT)

Figure 3 Neighbour-joining RTE clade phylogenetic tree. The NJ tree is a 50% consensus tree, with bootstrap values of >70 from 2,000 bootstrap
replications indicated at respective nodes. Alignment of complete RT conserved domain used the Kalign sequence alignment program [51,52] in
EMBL-EBI. The Neurospora Group II intron (GenBank: S07649) was used as the outgroup. 14 representative BmRTE sequences used in Figure 2 have
been included, along with newly described RTE elements as listed in the Methods, indicated with an asterisk. The RTE elements were broadly clustered
as reported in Figure 5 of [22] although the higher number of BmRTEs identified and included in this analysis, and together with the lower numbers
of Bov-B LINEs included have altered the tree topology. Overall, the elements were grouped into four sister groups of animal/plant RTE, Rex3/RTE, BovB LINE/RTE, and Caenorhabditis/Bombyx RTE. Although basal to the Plant/Animal RTE and Rex3/RTE subgroups, the positions of JAM1 and SR2 remained uncertain [22] due to the lower (<70%) confidence values at the respective nodes. Two nodes representing horizontal transfer events proposed by Zupunski et al. [22] are indicated. (A) from plants to some fishes, (B) from arthropods to reptiles and then to ruminant mammals. Note that
the medaka fish Oryzias has both a Rex3 RTE element similar to other fishes, and a plant-like RTE element.

RTE elements in Lepidopteran microsatellite clones

The largest collection of microsatellite markers for any
single Lepidopteran species was assembled by Miao et al.
[27] in B. mori. More than 13,600 positive clones were
identified by hybridization, yielding 2,690 confirmed by
sequencing and 555 polymorphic markers that were used
to construct a linkage map. Of these, 518 were deposited
in GenBank, and we identified 64 containing fragments of
one or more of the BmRTE elements by BLAST. Thus
about 12% of this collection of microsatellite markers
contained one or more RTE elements.
In their survey of repeated flanking sequences in Lepidopteran microsatellite markers, van't Hof et al. [6]
defined four different Lepidopteran Specific Core
Sequences (LSCS) that were represented in a large number of clones. Translation of the reverse complement of
their 44 bp LCSC1 in the second reading frame produces
a protein sequence identical to the last 12 residues of
BmRTE-d02. Moreover, the nucleotide sequence is identical to the corresponding region of HzRTE-1. Thus the
class of unilateral repeated microsatellites similar to
LCSC1 has an RTE element flanking one side. Examples
(Figure 4) include H. armigera microsatellite clones
HaD47 (GenBank:AY497338) [9], HarSSR3 (GenBank:AJ504787) [8] and HarSSR7 (GenBank:AJ627416)
[7], the H. zea HzMS1-6 microsatellite marker (GenBank:EF152206) [28], and the B. anynana microsatellite
marker BA-ATG230 (GenBank:DQ225294) [6]. TSD
sequences were identified for HzMS1-6, HaD47,
HarSSR7, and BA-ATG230.
The 3' ends of RTE elements are widespread in microsatellites isolated from many lepidopteran species. Figure
5 shows representative samples from 5 different species,

translated and aligned with the most similar 3' end of a B.
mori RTE element. The high similarity at the protein level
and the SSRs immediately following the stop codon are
evident. Different RTE elements can account for the subgroups 2A and 2B of microsatellites of Bicyclus anynana
previously described by van't Hof et al. [6] (Additional
File 3).
Additionally, 165 related non-redundant lepidopteran
microsatellite DNA loci were identified by tblastn
searches based on protein sequences of the full-length
HmRTE-e01 element, 13 full-length elements BmRTEd01 to -d13, one partial HaRTE-t01 and six partial BaRTE
elements (BaRTE-d01 to -d06; Additional File 3). A further 29 microsatellite loci with significant threshold values were identified from blastn searches of LSCS1,
HzRTE-1-1 and McRTE-t01 partial RTE elements. Lepidopteran RTE protein and DNA sequence homology
searches therefore identified association between microsatellite DNA loci and the non-LTR RTE elements from a
total of 22 species from superfamilies Papilionidea (B.
anynana, H. melpomene, Papilio zelicaon, Arhopala
epimuta, P. apollo, Drupadia theda, M. cinxia, and E.
aurinia), Hesperiidae (Erynnis properties), Geometroidea
(Chiasmia assimilis, Biston betularia), Noctuoidea (H.
armigera, H. zea, Arctia caja, Busseola fusca), Bombycoidea (B. mori), Pyraloidea (O. nubilalis), Tortricoidae
(Cydia pomonella, Lobesia botrana, Tortrix viridana) and
Yponomeutoidea (P. xylostella, Yponomeuta padellus). A
wide diversity of SSR units for the reported microsatellite
loci was identified (i.e., di-, tri-, tetra- and pentameric
nucleotide SSR units of (TGATG)n, (TAGA)n, (TTTA)n,
(TGA)n, (TGG)n, (ATT)n, (GAA)n, (TAT)n, (TG)n, (AT)n,
(GA)n; Additional File 5). The numbers of SSR units varied greatly from two to > 35, and included perfect, compound and imperfect SSR units.

Figure 5 Protein sequence alignments of translations of selected lepidopteran microsatellite loci and various BmRTEs 3' termini. Five examples of lepidopteran microsatellite loci with significant amino acid similarity to the translated C-terminal amino acid sequences of various Bombyx mori
RTE elements are shown. Stop codons adjacent to microsatellite repeat units and gaps inserted for alignment purpose are indicated by '*' and '-' respectively. Nucleotide positions are numbered according to GenBank entries of microsatellite DNA loci. Amino acid residue mismatches are indicated
in blue, microsatellite DNA SSR units are underlined. Identity and E-values obtained by stand-alone blastx search against the 25 BmRTEs. Microsatellite
DNA loci are: AEP078 (DQ380851, Arhopala epimuta, 66% identity to BmRTE-d01, E-value = 7e-13), HarSSR7 (AJ627416, Helicoverpa armigera, 80% identity to BmRTE-d02, E-value = 1e-04), DTH081 (DQ380790 reverse complemented, Drupadia theda, 62% identity to BmRTE-d04, E-value = 2e-11), BFU068
(DQ393655, Busseola fusca, 72% identify to BmRTE-d08, E-value = 6e-14), and Hm02 (DQ020073, Heliconius melpomene, 72% identity to BmRTE-d13, Evalue = 2e-05).

In various reported microsatellite DNA loci (e.g., in B.
mori, (GenBank:DQ242755), (GenBank:DQ242911); A.
L.
botrana,
(Gencaja,
(GenBank:AJ809357);
Bank:AY150998); B. betularia, (GenBank:AY190970,
AY226154); and C. pomonella, (GenBank:DQ393953)),
RTE-like sequences were present but they did not correspond to the 3' end of the element and were not immediately adjacent to the SSR units. These likely correspond to
ancient RTE insertions that have been interrupted by
later insertions of other elements (Table 1). Multiple
insertion events in close proximity by different RTE elements were also detected. In B. anynana BA-ATG244
(GenBank:DQ225299), opposite orientations of BaRTEd06 and BaRTE-d03 elements were identified and
included the repeat motifs (KAT)4 and (TGA)26 respectively (Table 1). In the partial B. anynana gDNA clone
BA-ATG1 (GenBank:AY785062), double insertions by
BaRTE elements were detected at both 5' and 3' termini.
The 5' terminal partial BaRTE-d06 element was located at
nucleotide positions 3 to 41 and included the
(TGA)TA(TGA)11 SSR units. At the 3' terminus of (GenBank:AY785062) we identified the BaRTE-d03 element at
nucleotide positions 339 to 383, however no SSR units
was found (Table 1).
Overall, of 2,183 lepidopteran microsatellite sequences
deposited in GenBank, 218 or almost 10% were found to
contain an RTE element (Additional File 6). The top 16
lepidopteran species accounted for 1,723 microsatellites,
202 or almost 12% of which contain RTE elements. There

is some heterogeneity within this group, with RTE content ranging from 0% to 44%. The remaining species with
27 or fewer microsatellites each account for 460 loci, only
16 of which (3.5%) contain RTEs. These differences could
reflect actual species differences in microsatellite frequencies or methodological differences among different
researchers; only some of which used enrichment techniques.
Molecular characterization of HaD47 non-allelic size
variants in H. armigera

The microsatellite marker HaD47 was developed by Scott
et al. [9] and used by them in population studies of H.
armigera in Australia. Sequence comparisons of a flanking region showed high similarity to LSCS1 and microsatellite loci from other Lepidoptera harbouring the 3' end of
an RTE element (Figure 4), and so to examine the reproducibility and reliability of this marker, we cloned and
sequenced size variants from two H. armigera individuals
collected from Dalmore, Victoria. Among five clones
from individual AD1, three sequence variants of different
sizes were identified (140 bp, (GenBank:EU293082); 224
404
bp,
(Genbp,
(GenBank:EU293080);
Bank:EU293081)). The 140 bp band (three clones) possessed an SSR motif of (TGA)4(TG)5, the 224 bp band
(one clone) had (TGA)7, and the 404 bp band (one clone)
had (TGA)4. In the AD2 individual, a 139 bp variant (4
clones, (GenBank:EU293084), with (TGA)4(TG)5,) and a
426 bp variant (two clones, (GenBank:EU293083)), with

Nucleotide positions within the microsatellite loci DNA sequences where respective RTEs were located, and the approximate lengths of the

(TGA)4) were identified. The 140 bp band from AD1 and
the 129 bp band from AD2 were very similar to the published sequence of HaD47 and are probably allelic. The
other bands, however, show no similarity to these two or
to one another in the region to the right of the SSR,
except for the 21 bp corresponding to the forward primer
(Figure 6). Thus these bands are not likely to be alleles of
HaD47 but instead represent amplicons generated by the
reverse primer's annealing to independent, unlinked sites
of insertion of the 3' end of the RTE element, and the forward primer's annealing to nearby regions with enough
sequence similarity to generate a PCR product.

Discussion
We have identified several RTE non-LTR retrotransposable elements in the Lepidoptera, and provided evidence
for their association with unilateral microsatellite DNA
families. These lepidopteran RTE elements therefore join
a small group of TEs in other organisms (e.g. Drosophila
[29], humans [30], barley [31]) as being associated with
the genesis of microsatellite DNA repeat units. They
account for a significant fraction of microsatellite markers isolated by many independent groups working with
Lepidoptera (almost 10% overall, ranging from 0% to 44%
for different species), and their wide occurrence may be
partly responsible for problematical aspects of these
markers.
Non-LTR RTE elements have a wide but disjunct phylogenetic distribution in eukaryotes [17,22,23] and have

been found in sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus), nematodes (C. elegans), blood flukes (Schistosoma
mansoni [32]), mosquitoes (Ae. aegypti), amphioxus
(Branchiostoma floridae [33]), fishes (Xiphophorus maculatus [34]), snakes (Vipera ammodytes [22]) and mammals (Bos taurus) as well as plants [22]. We have
identified additional full-length elements from cnidaria,
mollusca, and hagfish, as well as 25 from the genome of B.
mori and one from H. melpomene. Lepidopteran RTE elements discovered so far are very diverse but are all
grouped into the RTE clade of Malik et al. [23].
Genomic insertion sites of RTEs do not appear to be
sequence-specific, and can be discerned only by targetsite duplications of 6 - 12 bp after insertion. The typically
short 3' UTR often contains di- or tri-nucleotide simple
sequence repeats. Truncated RTE elements consisting
only of the 3' end of the RT coding sequence followed by
the 3' UTR and flanked by target-site duplications are
often found in genomes. This configuration suggests that
a staggered double-stranded break in the target sequence
was made, followed by reverse transcription of the fulllength RNA element from the 3' end, which was interrupted before completion so that only the 3' end of the
element was finally inserted between the target-site
duplications. A large number of truncated elements may
accumulate due to the replication efforts of just a few fulllength elements, similar to that reported for L1 retrotransposons (reviewed in [20]). For example, in the
mosquito Anopheles gambiae, the Ag-JAMMIN-2 ele-

Figure 6 Non-allelic size variants of Helicoverpa armigera microsatellite DNA locus HaD47. HaD47 microsatellite locus [9] non-allelic size variants in two Helicoverpa armigera (AD1, AD2). Size variants of 140 bp (AD1) and 139 bp (AD2) are most similar to the HaD47 published allele (142 bp,
nucleotides 131 to 272; AY497338). The partial non-LTR RTE includes the HaD47 reverse primer (R T) and the SSR units are indicated, and the forward
primer ( F) is on the host genome. Unknown host genomic sequences of the non-allelic size variants including length (in bp) are indicated by '?'.

ment is represented by five copies with intact ORFs and
about 1,940 truncated elements [35]. In the absence of a
full-length RTE sequence as evidence, such truncated
RTE elements may be misidentified as short interspersed
nucleotide elements (SINEs; [17]) which by contrast are
usually derived from abundant cellular RNAs, lack coding
potential, possess poly(A) tails, are independently transcribed from their own internal Pol III promoters, and
utilize proteins encoded by other retro-elements for their
insertion. Similarity of the predicted protein sequences at
the 3' ends enabled Malik and Eickbush [17] to recognize
that some families previously classified as SINEs were
actually truncated RTE elements, just as it has enabled us
to recognize RTE elements within isolated microsatellite
markers. This is because it is easier to recognize homology of divergent protein sequences than nucleotide
sequences.
Some insect TEs show a preference for inserting into
specific sequences, and sometimes these sequences are
simple sequence repeats. For example, DONG targets the
(TAA)n of the ribosomal DNA non-transcribed spacer
region [36], and the telomere-specific TRAS families target pentameric (TTAGG/CCTAA)n SSR units [37]. Since
these SSR-target insertion sequences are pre-existing, TE

insertion would not increase the abundance of SSRs in
the genome, but could increase the abundance of a particular unilateral family of SSR repeats by juxtaposing
more copies of the TE next to SSRs existing in different
genomic locations. We were not able to find evidence of
DONG or TRAS elements in microsatellite markers isolated from Lepidoptera; however it may be that some of
the still-uncharacterized LSCS sequence families are
formed in this way. By contrast, each new insertion of an
RTE element with SSRs in the 3' UTR does increase the
abundance of SSRs in the genome. The SSR may have
been present in the 3' UTR in the RNA molecule participating in the insertion, or may have been incorporated
into the cDNA by slippage of the RT enzyme during
reverse transcription. But since the SSR is positioned
between the two TSDs, it clearly did not exist in that location prior to the insertion event.
Some fingerprinting methods benefit from the random
multiple insertion of transposable elements into genomes
[38-40], however, these do not yield single-copy markers.
The difficulty of developing lepidopteran microsatellites
that function as reliable single-copy codominant markers
is widely acknowledged (e.g., [3-5,41,42]). Our sequence
comparison of size variants of the microsatellite marker
HaD47 showed that at least three different loci were

Tay et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:144
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/144

being amplified in different individuals, violating the single-copy assumption. With respect to codominance, a
deficiency in observed levels of heterozygosity relative to
Hardy-Weinberg expectations has been reported for
many published lepidopteran microsatellite DNA markers, and has often been attributed to the presence of null
alleles (e.g., [41]). Null alleles can significantly alter the
estimation of population substructure patterns by
decreasing the within population allelic diversity (e.g.,
[43]). However, many microsatellite loci reported to
exhibit significantly lower than expected levels of
heterozygosity are associated with RTE elements, such as
in H. armigera (HarSSR3, [8]; HarSSR7, [7]), H. zea
(HzMS1-6, [28]), Y. padellus (YP35, [44]), A. epimuta
(AeG5, [45]) and B. betularia (Biston 12, [46]). Although
it is still unknown whether a systematic RTE-associated
effect on heterozygosity exists, the possibility deserves to
be taken into consideration along with other explanations
such as the Wahlund effect or selection pressure (e.g.,
insecticide applications on pest species).
One approach to improving the reliability of microsatellite markers is to target single-copy regions in the
genome. Widdel et al. [47] used Cot analysis to isolate the
slowly-reannealing, low-copy-number fraction of the
genome of Ae. japonicus from which SSR clones were
subsequently isolated. Another approach is to sort
through clones already obtained to identify those sharing
similarities in their flanking regions and discarding these;
Meglécz [48] has described a computer program
MICROFAMILY for that purpose. Another alternative
for developing codominant markers is to avoid SSRs
entirely and to design PCR primers to conserved exons in
protein-coding genes to screen for polymorphisms in the
intervening intron (EPIC markers, for example as developed as an alternative to microsatellites for H. armigera,
[49]). A completely opposite strategy is to exploit the high
copy number and dispersed distribution of the repeated
sequences flanking microsatellites to develop fingerprinting-type, dominant markers [38-40]. Anderson et al. [50]
developed two repetitive flanking sequences (ReFS1 and
ReFS2) based on microsatellites isolated from A. caja,
where both ReFS markers are part of the LSCS1 sequence
with minor variations. They used PCR primers designed
to these sequences to discriminate between different species of the moth genus Schrankia and to detect interspecific hybrids; dominant markers are sufficient for both
purposes. In this application, the sequence conservation
of the RTE element during evolution is useful for extending marker utility outside of the species of discovery, and
insertions that occur after species divergence are useful
for discriminating species; presuming that these insertions have fixed.
New lepidopteran TEs are continuously being identified and characterized (e.g., [24,25]). TEs identified to

Page 11 of 16

date in the Lepidoptera are likely to represent only a fraction of the total numbers and types, and some of these
others may also be responsible for the genesis of unilateral or bilateral microsatellite DNA families in various
lepidopteran species.

Conclusions
The presence of microsatellite DNA families in the Lepidoptera has mystified many evolutionary and population
geneticists over the last decade. Our findings that nonLTR retrotransposable elements of the RTE clade have
rendered large proportions of lepidopteran microsatellite
DNA markers developed to-date ineffective is indicative
of the depth of problems challenging many researchers
who have invested resources to developing such molecular genetics tools. Our study will enable TE-affected DNA
markers to be recognised across a wide range of organisms, thus allowing informed decisions to be made
regarding the utilisation of such DNA markers in future
population and evolutionary genetic studies. The presence of RTEs across diverse plant and animal evolutionary lineages implies that the RTE-associated
microsatellite DNA families phenomenon may be widespread in many biological systems, and likely to represent
one of the many yet unrecognised classes of TEs capable
of generating microsatellite DNA families.
Methods
Identification of lepidopteran RTE elements
In Bombyx mori

The C. elegans RTE-1 amino acid sequences (GenBank:U58775, U0063, g2253129) as reported in Youngman et al. [18] and Malik and Eickbush [17] were used to
identify related RTE elements through tblastn searches in
NCBI and KaikoBlast. There are currently three different
unannotated genome assemblies available in the wgs section at NCBI. We searched the second assembly with 6fold
coverage
(GenBank
AADK01000001:AADK01066482) in preference to the
first assembly with 3-fold coverage (GenBank
BAAB01000001:BAAB01213289) because of the larger
contig size of the second assembly; and in preference to
the third assembly with 9-fold coverage (GenBank
BABH01000001:BABH01088672) because most repeated
sequences including RTEs had been masked out and not
restored in the third version. All positive gDNA
sequences identified in B. mori were assembled using
Sequencher 4.5 (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor
MI, USA) to obtain consensus copies of full-length B.
mori RTE elements. When an RTE element spanned two
or more contigs, only those with >95% sequence identity
in the region of overlap were used.

In Heliconius melpomene

We used the C. elegans RTE-1 protein sequence (GenBank:AAC72298) in a tblastn search within the NCBI,
specifying 'Lepidoptera' within the Entrez query search
parameter. Significant positive matches were recorded
and the H. melpomene BAC clone AEHM-22C5 (GenBank:CU462842) was assessed for putative coding
sequences using the NCBI ORF Finder search tool and
implementing the default genetic codes option. Protein
sequences identified by the ORF search were subjected to
blastp searches against the non-redundant (nr) database
to ascertain the presence of RTE-like conserved domains.
SSR units flanking the 3' UTR of putative RTE-like conserved domains were visually identified. DNA sequences
flanking the 3' end of the SSR units and the 5' UTR were
manually examined for evidence of TSD sequences.
Annotation was added to the GenBank record CU462842
by the submitter, Dr. Simon W. Baxter, Cambridge University.
Identification of RTE elements from other organisms

The nr, wgs, and dbEST sections of GenBank were
searched using tblastn with protein sequences derived
from the following: XM_001196835 (Strongylocentrotus
purpuratus), AJ621035 (Rex3 from Tetraodon nigroviridis), and AF332697 (Vipera ammodytes) as well as the

Additional full-length B. mori RTE elements previously
identified by Zupunski et al. [22] on the basis of partial
sequences (Prof. Dusan Kordis, Jozef Stefan Institute, Ljubljana, Slovenia, pers. comm.) are BmRTE-d12 (partial
sequence AV406121), BmRTE-d24 (GU815089, partial
sequence AV4052480), and BmRTE-d25 (GU815090, partial sequence AV406078).
Phylogenetic analysis of putative lepidopteran RTE
elements

To determine the evolutionary relationships between the
full-length RTE elements identified in this study and previously identified full-length non-LTR retrotransposable
elements, complete alignment of RT domain amino acids
(EMBL:DS36752) [23] was obtained. The RT conserved
domain
of
non-LTR
retroelements
from
(EMBL:DS36752) [23], all newly assembled B. mori RTE
elements (BmRTE-d01 to BmRTE-d25; (Genbank:FJ265542 - FJ265564, GU815089- GU815090), and
the H. melpomene HmRTE-e01 element (GenBank
CU462842) were identified using NCBI CD search program against the RT conserved domain CD01650 within
the database CDD-31608 PSSMs, prior to a global RT
conserved domain alignment using the Kalign program
[51,52] in EMBL-EBI. The RT conserved domain of CRE
clade elements (CRE1, CRE2, CZAR and SLACS, see
Malik et al. [23]) were included as outgroups. For cluster
analysis, we implemented the Neighbour-Joining method
and conditions (tree bisection-reconnection branch
swapping, 2,000 bootstrap resampling, and maximum
trees saved at each step limited to five) specified by Malik
et al. [23] using PAUP* v4.0b10 [53]. Due to the large data
set of Malik et al. [23], we included only elements from
the R2, RTE, R4, L1, Jockey, and CR1 clades with our
BmRTE and HmRTE elements. The new amino acid
alignment file used in the phylogenetic analysis is provided in Additional File 7.
Phylogenetic analysis of RTE subgroups used the RT
conserved domain of RTE and Rex3 elements that were
newly identified in this study (Additional File 2) and also
included various elements previously reported by Zupunski et al. [22]. The RT conserved domain were identified
using the CD Search program in NCBI http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/cdd.shtml against
conserved domain CD01650. Outgroup for the RTE clade
phylogenetic analysis used the Neurospora group II
intron (GenBank:S07649), with the RT conserved domain

identified against conserved domain CD01651 using the
NCBI CD Search program. Sequence alignment was carried out by including amino acid sequences representative of the conserved domains CD01650 and CD01651
with the identified RT conserved domain amino acid
sequences of all RTE, Rex3 and Bov-B LINE elements
(Additional File 8). Both CD01650 and CD01651 representative sequences were removed prior to phylogenetic
analysis using the Neighbour Joining method as
described above.
RTE-like elements in public DNA databases

Using the Lepidoptera Specific Core Sequences 1 to 4
(LSCS 1-4, [6]) we searched the NCBI GenBank nonredundant (nr) genomic DNA database using the Basic
Local Alignment Tool blastn [54], and limiting the Entrez
query with search term 'Lepidoptera'. Significant matches
with expected threshold (E-value) of < E-04 were manually search for evidence of TSD and the presence of 3' SSR
units.

40 amino acids) or PAM70 (≤ 70 amino acids) settings.
All remaining algorithm parameters were as default settings. Default tblastn settings were implemented for fulllength B. mori (BmRTE-d01 to BmRTE-d13) and H. melpomene HmRTE-e01 RTE elements. All significant lepidopteran microsatellite loci matching the complete and
partial RTE elements were sorted for non-redundancy
based on GenBank Accession numbers. Lepidopteran
microsatellite loci from all tblastn and blastn searches
that exhibited threshold values of greater than 1E-04 were
considered non-significant and thus excluded in all subsequent analyses. All microsatellite loci with significant
sequence homologies to partial RTE-like elements of H.
zea, H. armigera, B. anynana and M. cinxia, and to fulllength B. mori and H. melpomene RTE elements (limiting
to within 200 amino acid residues to the 3' terminus)
were further characterized with respect to SSR units
(Additional File 5, Figure 5) and TSD sequences where
possible.
Molecular characterization of HaD47 alleles

RTE-related lepidopteran microsatellite loci in GenBank

B. anynana microsatellite DNA loci described in van't
Hof et al. [6] were aligned and grouped using Sequencher
4.5. Consensus 5' flanking sequences prior to the SSR
units from grouped microsatellite loci were translated
into consensus protein sequences for use in tblastn analyses along with the 'Lepidopteran Microsatellite' Entrez
query search term. In Melitaea cinxia, a preliminary
blastn search using the LSCS1 DNA sequence ('Lepidoptera' as Entrez query search term) identified a significant (E-value = 4e-07) hit (GenBank:DQ389528,
MCclone113). SSR units at the 3' UTR, and TSD
sequences at 5' and 3' flanking regions were visually identified.
Complete amino acid sequences of RTE elements from
B. mori (BmRTE-d01 to -d13), H. melpomene HmRTEe01, and partial RTE-like element protein sequences from
B. anynana and M. cinxia (Additional File 3), and H. zea
(HzRTE-1-1, [25]) were used as input queries in tblastn
searches
in
NCBI.
Accession
numbers
DQ242653:DQ243686 representing the B. mori microsatellites of Miao et al. [27] were searched separately with
the BmRTE elements as queries. Partial RTE-like element
DNA sequences from H. armigera (identified based on
sequence homology to HzRTE-1-1), H. zea, M. cinxia and
B. anynana were also searched using blastn for homology
to lepidopteran microsatellite loci within the GenBank.
The search term 'Lepidoptera microsatellite' was used in
the Entrez query option in all tblastn and blanstn
searches. Due to the general short RTE protein sequences
identified from H. armigera, B. anynana and M. cinxia,
tblastn expected threshold of 100 was specified within
the 'General Parameters' window. Matrix options implemented were either the default (BLOSUM62), PAM30 (≤

The microsatellite DNA locus HaD47 (GenBank:AY497338) [9] with its reverse primer designed
within the LSCS1 is problematic when used in population
genetic studies [15] (but see [50]). The molecular dynamics of RTE integration sites within the host genome was
investigated by PCR amplification using the HaD47 microsatellite forward and reverse markers following published PCR conditions [9]. DNA from two field-collected
H. armigera (AD1, AD2, from Dalmore, Victoria, Australia; [55]) were used in this analysis. Post PCR purification,
cloning, sequencing and post sequencing DNA analyses
of HaD47 microsatellite PCR amplicons followed the protocol of Scott et al. [49]. We randomly selected five and
six positively transformed colonies from AD1 and AD2
respectively to confirm the presence of partial RTE-like
elements, to ascertain insertion site specificity and to
characterize the patterns of associated SSR units.

Additional file 6 Table showing the top 16 lepidopteran species with
the most abundant microsatellite DNA sequences deposited in GenBank (30 June, 2009). Using as input queries lepidopteran RTE amino acid
sequences in Additional Files 3, 3, and 8 (for tblastn), and the DNA
sequences of partial RTEs in Additional File 3 (for blastn), BLAST searches
within GenBank against the entrez query search term "Lepidoptera Microsatellite" were carried out. Percentages in parentheses indicate proportion
of microsatellite DNA sequences that contained RTEs. The overall proportion of lepidopteran microsatellite DNA sequences containing RTEs
remained similar at 9.26% when Bombyx mori microsatellite DNA sequences
were excluded (due to the majority of these microsatellite DNA sequences
being reported for primer regions instead of the actual microsatellite simple sequence repeat unit regions). The 68 B. mori microsatellite DNA loci
identified to be associated with RTE elements included 64 from 518 loci
deposited in GenBank by Miao et al. [27]. Most of these loci are represented
by separate forward and reverse sequence reads, so there are about twice
as many sequences deposited as numbers of loci. Among the 16 Lepidoptera species with the most abundant microsatellite DNA sequences in
GenBank, RTE content ranged from 0% in Comonympha hero to 28.75% in
Helicoverpa armigera, 30.0% in Busseola fusca and 43.55% in Bicyclus anynana.
