Abstract
Background: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) represent the most abundant type of DNA
variation in the vertebrate genome, and their applications as genetic markers in numerous studies
of molecular ecology and conservation of natural populations are emerging. Recent large-scale
sequencing projects in several fish species have provided a vast amount of data in public databases,
which can be utilized in novel SNP discovery in salmonids. However, the suggested duplicated
nature of the salmonid genome may hamper SNP characterization if the primers designed in
conserved gene regions amplify multiple loci.
Results: Here we introduce a new intron-primed exon-crossing (IPEC) method in an attempt to
overcome this duplication problem, and also evaluate different priming methods for SNP discovery
in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and other salmonids. A total of 69 loci with differing priming
strategies were screened in S. salar, and 27 of these produced ~13 kb of high-quality sequence data
consisting of 19 SNPs or indels (one per 680 bp). The SNP frequency and the overall nucleotide
diversity (3.99 × 10-4) in S. salar was lower than reported in a majority of other organisms, which
may suggest a relative young population history for Atlantic salmon. A subset of primers used in
cross-species analyses revealed considerable variation in the SNP frequencies and nucleotide
diversities in other salmonids.
Conclusion: Sequencing success was significantly higher with the new IPEC primers; thus the total
number of loci to screen in order to identify one potential polymorphic site was six times less with
this new strategy. Given that duplication may hamper SNP discovery in some species, the IPEC
method reported here is an alternative way of identifying novel polymorphisms in such cases.

Background
The diversification of the variety of molecular markers
available has been an important development in the field
of genetics over the past two decades [1], with one of the

more recent additions to the 'molecular toolbox' being
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): a variant of traditional DNA sequencing which potentially enables highthroughput analysis of numerous independent (mostly)

bi-allelic DNA sequence polymorphisms. The increase in
the range of molecular markers partly stems from the realisation that no particular marker type is ideal for all situations, and SNPs are no exception to this. Their beneficial
features include having a relatively simple mutation
model [2,3] and a high abundance in the genome (see e.g.
[4]). Furthermore, the fact that SNPs occur in coding
regions enables assessment of polymorphisms potentially
directly affecting the phenotype [5]. On the other hand, as
SNPs are normally bi-allelic markers, more loci are
needed to obtain sufficient statistical power in certain
analyses (see e.g. [6]) and allele frequencies of SNPs are
usually skewed in population level analyses [7]. In theory,
the limited amount of information in a single SNP locus
can be compensated by increasing the number of loci
screened, and several high-throughput procedures have
been developed to facilitate this need (see [5,8]). Overall
however, it is clear that SNPs are an important class of
molecular markers for genomics research and can potentially be applied in a wide range of studies.
While the recognized benefits of SNPs have accelerated
their use in studies of model organisms [9-13], the application of SNPs in genetic studies of wild species has been
relatively rare. Their potential use in animal genetics has
been reviewed by Vignal et al. [14], presenting the usefulness of SNPs in, e.g., parentage assignment, animal tagging (see also [15]) and especially in QTL mapping, but
similar studies with natural organisms have only been
reported recently, most likely due to a lack of suitable
markers. Recently however, new SNP discovery strategies
(e.g. [16]) have resulted in characterizations of SNPs in
many natural populations of vertebrates to address several
evolutionary, ecological and conservation issues. For
example, SNPs have been applied for the identification of
cryptic vole species [17], to investigate the level of genome
introgression in a passerine bird hybrid zone [18,19], and
to study the population genetics of wolves [20].
SNP discovery in model organisms has primarily been
performed by comparing genomic information of multiple individuals in the public databases in order to identify
putative polymorphic sites (e.g. [21]). This has been a useful approach for species with a wealth of nuclear sequence
data available, but is not a very feasible method for the
majority of non-model organisms. In species with little
published sequence data available, SNP identification has
been carried out by sequencing random DNA fragments
(e.g. [16,22,23]), or by using a targeted gene approach
where primers have been designed in conserved regions of
orthologous gene sequences from closely related species
to amplify less conserved regions like introns, generally
termed 'comparative anchor tagged sequences' ('CATS') or
the 'exon-primed intron-crossing' ('EPIC') method (e.g.
[16,24-28]). Again, this latter type of SNP discovery may

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/192

be challenging if the entire taxa of interest lacks published
sequence data. In recent years, however, large-scale
sequencing and EST projects have provided usable data
for a great variety of new species and a particular increase
can be seen in fish species, due in part to their potential
use as models in environmental genomics [29] as well as
the broad variety of species of aquaculture importance.
The total number of SNPs needed to trace different strains
within a species has been estimated with salmonid fish
[30] and, even individual identification would be possible
if the population and/or species-specific SNPs were characterized as has been conducted in wolves [20]. Furthermore, Glaubitz et al. [6] estimated in a simulation study
that about five times more SNPs than microsatellites are
needed to determine pair-wise genetic relationships.
Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) has been one of the most
widely studied fish species in recent decades due to its
importance for aquaculture and conservation, but extensive SNP characterization studies with this salmonid species have been scarce. Recently, large-scale sequencing,
EST and BAC library projects have made a large amount of
data available in the public databases for S. salar (see [3133]; and also [34-36]). These genomic resources have
given rise to the first exploitation of EST databases for SNP
discovery (unpublished data, Hayes et al). However,
Hayes et al. (unpublished data) speculated that a proportion of the potential SNPs observed in S. salar EST
sequences could in fact be a consequence of ancient duplication events in the salmonid genome, and some of the
2,507 putative EST-based SNPs found could actually be
sequence differences between ancestral duplicates (i.e.
paralogues) rather than true SNPs. Similarly, genome
duplication has also been suggested to affect SNP identification in a recent study of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus
tshawytscha, O. nerka, and O. keta) [37], where one-third of
the analyzed loci were suggested to be paralogue sequence
variants rather than true SNPs. Potentially sequence differences between duplicons rather than SNPs (see [38]) may
emerge especially when the more highly conserved
regions (i.e. exons) of the genes are used for primer design
as this increases the risk of amplifying both paralogs of the
same locus. Thus far, such exon-focused methods (e.g.
EPIC) have been exploited in most of the SNP discovery
surveys, and no study exists where the more variable, noncoding segments of the genes (e.g. introns) have been utilized to design specific primers aimed at binding to only
one of the duplicated loci. This is probably due to fact that
more than one sequence copy of the particular gene seldom exists in the databases and not much is known about
the extent of potential duplicated genes in different species. However, intron sequences of one known duplicated
gene in salmonids – growth hormone – have been used as
a source of variation for phylogenetic and population
studies [39-41], indicating that the divergence in introns

could be sufficient for a discriminative priming strategy
between putative paralogs in salmonid species.
The aim of this study was to characterize potential SNPs in
the Atlantic salmon genome using gene sequence data for
salmonids and other teleost species obtained from GenBank [42]. Initially, PCR primers were designed by utilizing the exonic regions of salmonid or other teleost species
(EPIC). However, on observing that numerous duplicated
genes had likely been amplified, a new method – termed
intron-primed exon-crossing (IPEC) – was developed to
circumvent this problem, whereby primers were designed
in more variable intronic regions of salmonid genes. The
feasibility of this new priming method to avoid amplifications of potential duplicated loci was evaluated, and the
proportion of conserved duplicated loci assessed. Polymorphism was assessed by sequencing the fragments of
individuals originating from 15 salmon populations
spanning the species range. Furthermore, a subset of primers was tested with brown trout (Salmo trutta), arctic char
(Salvelinus alpinus) and grayling (Thymallus thymallus) to
investigate the usefulness of these loci to produce crossspecies sequence data from other salmonids.

Results
Exon- vs. intron-primed SNP discovery strategies
Out of a total of 47 loci for which primers were designed
using the EPIC strategy, only 14 (30%) primer pairs produced PCR products suitable for direct sequencing – i.e.,
PCR amplification resulted in a single, strong band as visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis (Table 1a). The vast
majority of these (13 out of 14) were loci where primer
sequences were designed using salmonid exonic
sequences. However, of these 13 clear PCR products, highquality sequence was obtained for only 4 loci, with the
sequences of other loci resembling that expected if multiple sequences were present in the same reaction. For primers based on exonic sequences of non-salmonid teleosts,
the proportion of loci for which a single clear PCR product
was obtained was much lower (4%). However, following
re-PCR of one of the multiple bands observed, high-quality sequence was obtained for a similar overall proportion
of loci to that for exonic primers based on salmonid
sequences (24% vs. 18%: Table 1a).

In comparison, the success rate of intron-primed exoncrossing (based on salmonid intron sequences) was considerably higher: a single clear PCR product was obtained
for 21 of 22 loci (95%) and high-quality sequences were
obtained for 17 of these (77%) – i.e., a success rate almost
four times higher than that obtained using the EPIC
approach (χ2 = 7.771, d.f. = 1, P = 0.005). In addition, of
the loci for which high-quality sequence was obtained,
the proportion of loci in which polymorphism was identified was higher in IPEC-derived sequences (47% vs.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/192

30%). This difference is even more striking when considering the proportion of polymorphic loci in the total
number of loci initially tested (36% vs. 6%). In other salmonid species the proportion of loci for which sequences
were successfully obtained ranged from 12% in grayling
to 60% in brown trout (Table 1b). Sequences of all loci
have been deposited in GenBank with the accession numbers [GenBank:DQ834872–DQ834885]. Details of the
loci for which high-quality sequence data were not
obtained are available on request.
Level of genetic diversity in the gene sequences of Atlantic
salmon and other species
In total, high quality sequences were obtained for 27 loci
with a total of 12,911 bp. Nineteen polymorphic sites
were observed in 10 loci which translates to an average of
one SNP per 680 bp in the S. salar genome (Table 2, Additional file 2). The observed frequency is one of the lowest
reported for any fish species and lower than the frequencies reported in the majority of multi-locus studies in different taxonomic groups; only some mammalian and
avian studies exhibited lower estimates (Figure 2). The
distribution of polymorphism among the loci was however highly skewed, with no variation observed in ~60%
of loci (Table 2, Figure 3). The nucleotide diversity of individual loci ranged from 0 to 17.5 × 10-4 and over all loci
was 3.99 × 10-4 (Table 2, Figure 3). Twelve of the polymorphic sites were located in intronic regions of verified salmonid genes whereas none occurred in the exons (Table
2). This results in the nucleotide diversity estimates of 6.7
× 10-4 (1 SNP/405 bp) for introns and <1.9 × 10-4 for
exons (less than 1/1448 bp) respectively. As a comparison, the level of variability in transferrin, a gene suggested
to have been affected by the forces of diversifying selection in salmonid fishes, was also assessed (locus sTf, Additional files 1 and 2). The nucleotide diversity of this gene
was many times higher (46.0 × 10-4) than that observed in
other genes. Furthermore, three of the five SNPs (1/77 bp)
observed in this gene occurred in exonic sequences, two of
which were non-synonymous.

Considering other salmonid species, the overall nucleotide diversity for S. alpinus was similar to S. salar but the
estimates were about six times higher for T. thymallus and
S. trutta (Table 2). Furthermore, the frequency of polymorphic sites was much higher in T. thymallus (1/144 bp)
and S. trutta (1/153 bp) compared with S. salar, but
almost identical for S. alpinus (1/695 bp). Contrary to S.
salar, the transferrin gene in S. trutta (396 bp sequenced)
exhibited no variation among the analyzed populations;
instead, four SNPs were located in the exonic regions of
other genes, also changing the reading frame of tap2A
gene (Table 2).

Discussion
The results of this study have important implications for
SNP discovery in non-model species with ancestrally
duplicated genomes. Exon-targeted primers using
sequence data from the same or closely related taxa which
have previously been used in SNP characterization studies
with non-model species [16,22,26,37] were relatively
unsuccessful in Atlantic salmon compared with the IPEC
approach proposed here, where less conservative gene
regions – i.e., introns – were the target sequences for
primer design. The reduced success of the EPIC approach
for SNP discovery is most likely due to the duplicated
nature of the salmonid genome. This genomic duplication
is suggested to have taken place in the ray-finned fish lineage after its divergence from tetrapods (reviewed in [43])

and additional, more recent polyploidization events have
also been detected in the salmonid sublineage (see [44]).
The subsequent re-diploidization event in the salmonid
genome has generated duplicated paralogs, which may
diverge from each other due to the relaxation of purifying
selection in one of the copies (reviewed in [45]). Thus,
assuming that diverged introns evolve even more rapidly
due to lower selective pressure, the amplification of
potential duplicates could be minimized by focusing on
those regions for PCR primer design.
Indeed in S. salar, this new intron-targeted IPEC method
clearly outperformed the widely used EPIC (or CATS)
approach, which utilizes conserved gene regions in crossspecies applications. The proportion of screened loci that

revealed polymorphism in S. salar was around six times
higher with the IPEC (36.4% polymorphic) than the EPIC
(6.4%) method (Table 1a), suggesting that less effort is
needed to yield the same number of SNPs than with the
EPIC (or CATS) method [28,37].
Recently, special interest has focused on identifying multisite variation after duplication from ordinary SNPs in
humans [46]. Studies with several salmonid species have
also speculated that some of the observed polymorphic
sites could actually be variation between retained paralogs
of duplicated segments rather than true SNPs ([37,38];
unpublished data, Hayes et al). The duplication presumably lowered the success rate of the EPIC primers, especially
those designed in salmonid genes (Table 1a), but it may
have a minor effect on the novel SNPs identified in this
study as the IPEC method produced most of the polymorphic loci (71% in total, Table 1a–b). Therefore, this
intron-focused approach should be a feasible method to
avoid obtaining potential 'duplicated SNPs' when identifying novel polymorphic loci from the species bearing

putative duplicated genomic fragments or even an entire
duplicated genome.
The observed nucleotide diversity estimates over all loci in
S. salar (3.99 × 10-4) was highly similar to that in European humans [9] and about twofold lower than that
observed in a larger scale survey with human genome [4].
On the other hand, the estimations are about ten times
less than reported in birds [16] or plants [47,48] and
about three times less than reported in a recent study of
the GH1 gene of S. salar [41]. The greater number of base
pairs and the number of independent loci sequenced here
most likely better represents the overall nucleotide diversity estimate of S. salar genome than that observed in a
single locus [41]. A lower nucleotide diversity in S. salar is
further supported by the fact that about 60% of all analyzed loci showed no variation (Figure 3), and the overall
SNP frequency was lower than in the majority of other
organisms (Figure 2 and references therein). A lower level
of sequence variation could be a consequence of relatively
recent colonization of S. salar in its present habitats in the

northern hemisphere after the last glaciation about 10,
000 years ago [49] as such patterns of reduced genetic variability in areas previously glaciated areas has been
observed for other northern species (e.g. [50,51]).
The SNP frequency in non-coding regions was at least
threefold higher than coding regions in S. salar, which is
to be expected due to the greater selective pressure on
exons as observed in a recent human genome study [52].
Studies on disease-associated genes in humans have
revealed an even higher proportion of coding SNPs,
implying the effects of natural selection [53,54]. This may
also explain the higher frequency of SNPs in the coding
region of the transferrin gene, which plays an important
role in resistance to bacterial infection in a variety of
organisms and was earlier reported to be under positive
selection in S. salar [55]. On the contrary, no polymorphisms were detected in the transferrin gene of S. trutta,
proposing that the effects of selection may vary considerably within lineages. However this could be due to the
selection of the transferrin gene region which was
sequenced in this study as considerable molecular variation has been reported in the transferrin gene within European S. trutta populations based on electrophoretic
screening [56].
The overall SNP frequencies also varied among the salmonid species examined here (between 1/144 bp in T. thymallus to 1/695 bp in S. alpinus) but were, however, within
the range of the SNP frequencies for a range of multi-locus

studies with different species (Figure 2 and references
therein). The estimates for S. salar and S. alpinus were in
congruence with a previous study on S. salar (unpublished data, Hayes et al.), whereas the frequencies for T.
thymallus and S. trutta were closer to a recent study with
Pacific salmon [37]. Furthermore, in S. trutta and T. thymallus the nucleotide diversities were about six times
higher than in S. salar or S. alpinus (Table 2). The high
level of diversity in T. thymallus is consistent with the deep
divergence between the evolutionary lineages assessed
[57]. However, the high level of diversity in S. trutta is
more difficult to explain as all individuals analysed originate from the same evolutionary lineage (the Atlantic lineage) proposed by Bernatchez [58]. However it is
important to note that no Finnish S. trutta samples were
assessed in the study of Bernatchez [58] and thus additional diversity may be harboured in this region.

Conclusion
Exploitation of the exponentially increasing amount of
gene sequence data in public databases such as GenBank
and recent EST projects is a very useful basis for identifying new polymorphic loci from the genomes of nonmodel organisms. Applications of SNPs have already been
reported in ecological and conservation studies of natural
populations [17,20,22], and these new types of markers
have also been used to identify different Atlantic salmon
strains [30]. However, as observed in this study, polymorphisms can be biased toward a relatively small portion of
loci (Figure 3) thus increasing the effort required to identify a sufficient number of SNPs for ecological and population genetic applications. Based on a simulation study,
the need for independent SNPs is fivefold that of microsatellites [6]. Furthermore, in salmonid fish the genome
duplication event has been suggested to reduce SNP validation success ([37]; unpublished data, Hayes et al.), a
result supported by this study, which may further hinder
the development of a large number of independent loci.
Therefore, the new IPEC approach introduced here will be
a useful way to identify true SNPs for various applications
in species with presumably duplicated genomes.

Methods
Candidate loci identification
Initially, candidate sequence fragments were extracted
from GenBank using the criteria that they consisted of
both exon and intron regions, the intronic regions were
~400–600 bp in length to enable a single forward or
reverse sequencing read of the particular PCR product,
and that there were long enough exonic sequences flanking both sides of the desired intron for PCR primer design.
Then, two different EPIC approaches were used in the
primer design processes: (I) primers were designed on
flanking exonic sequences of S. salar or other salmonid
genes, or (II) flanking exonic sequences of other teleost

fishes were used to design oligonucleotides. In addition,
when the success rate of these exon-primed primers was
seen to be low, a new intron-primed exon-crossing
method was introduced (hereafter called IPEC) where at
least one primer was designed in the intronic regions of
salmonid fish genes (Additional file 1) in an attempt to
avoid amplification of potential paralogues. It should be
noted that some of the primers designed in introns amplified only intronic sequences without spanning any exonic
regions (6/24 in S. salar; Table 1a) but for the sake of uniformity all these fragments are referred as IPEC loci. Based
on the criteria described above, a total of 69 PCR primer
pairs (Additional file 1) predicted to amplify fragments of
~400–700 bp in total length were designed using the program Primer3 [59].
Sampled individuals and populations
One S. salar individual per population from each of 15
populations covering a wide range of the species' distribution in Europe and North America were assessed for polymorphism (Figure 1). Of these, Rivers Pistojoki and Shuja
and Lake Saimaa exhibit a non-anadromous migration
behaviour, whereas all others were anadromous populations. Furthermore, the Lake Saimaa and River Neva samples were of hatchery origin. Different subsets of primers
were also tested with five other salmonid (S. trutta, S. alpinus and T. thymallus) populations (one individual per
population) around Europe to investigate the cross-species amplification success of these loci: S. trutta samples (n
= 5) were from Poland, Scotland and three locations in
Finland; S. alpinus samples (n = 5) were from Russia, Norway, Scotland and two locations in Finland; and T. thymallus samples (n = 5) were from Norway, Russia, Slovenia
and two locations in Finland. Genomic DNA was

Amplification and sequencing of the loci
Details of all primers used in this study are presented in
Additional file 1. PCR amplifications were carried out in a
total volume of 20 μl as outlined in Ryynänen and Primmer [62] and using the primers and annealing temperatures outlined in Additional file 1. In general, all PCR
programs were first optimized using the 'touchdown' PCR
protocol described in [63], except that the extension step
was 45 s at 72°C. More specific PCR programs were then
used for those loci which produced clear PCR products in
the initial amplifications.

As PCR amplifications with primers designed in
sequences of non-salmonid species generated multiple
fragments in most of the loci, re-PCR amplifications were
performed for PCR bands extracted from agarose gels (see
Additional file 1) to obtain a single PCR product for
sequencing. The initial PCR products were visualized on
1–2% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide, and
the strongest band was selected to represent the amplicon
of the particular locus. A small piece of gel including the
desired PCR product was pierced with a plastic pipette tip
and, to elute the DNA fragments, the gel piece was dissolved in 50 μl of H2O and incubated for at least one hour
at room temperature. The re-PCR amplification was then
performed with the same primers and protocol as before,
except for reducing the number of PCR cycles to 30 and
using 1–2 μl of the eluted PCR fragment as a template.
The PCR products were cleaned with GFX™ DNA purification columns (Amersham Biosciences) or Montage®
PCRμ96 Plates (Millipore) to remove unincorporated
nucleotides and primers before direct sequencing. The
PCR products were then cycle sequenced in both directions using the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing
Ready Reaction Kit 1.0 premix (PE Biosystems) as recommended by the manufacturer, using one of the original
PCR primers in turn (Additional file 1) as sequencing
primers. After sequencing, the products were purified
using Sephadex spin columns (Amersham Biosciences) or
Montage® SEQ96 Plates (Millipore), and electrophoresed
with an ABI 377 automated sequencer (PE Biosystems)
following the manufacturer's recommendations.
Data analysis
Sequenced loci from different populations were basecalled and aligned using the 'SNP pipeline' [21] – accessible from SNP analysis [64] web server- which employs the
Phred/Phrap/PolyPhred series of base-calling, alignment
and SNP identification programs [65-67]. All putative
SNP sites, either heterozygous or homozygous, were also

inspected and evaluated manually and only approved as
'true SNPs' if they met at least one of the following criteria:
high-quality sequences (phred score ≥ 20) of the rarer
nucleotide variant obtained (i) in one or more individuals
in both directions (69.2% of the SNPs observed), (ii) in
one direction for at least two individuals (23.1%), or (iii)
in one individual in one direction in a region of high
sequence quality (7.7%). The classification of validated
SNPs in other salmonids was 38.7%, 22.6% and 38.7%
respectively. Low-quality single-read sequence regions
were excluded from all analyses. Candidate sequences
obtained with the primers designed in non-salmonid fish
sequences were subjected to a Blast homology search [68]
against GenBank [42] and the Atlantic Salmon Gene
Index [36] to reveal putative homologous genes from the
salmon genome.
Nucleotide diversities for the successfully sequenced PCR
fragments were estimated using the formula 'theta' = K/[L
* [1-1 + 2-1 + 3-1 + ... + (n-1)-1]], where K is the number of
observed polymorphic sites, L is the total length of the
sequence (in bp) and n is the total number of chromosomes screened. The formula corrects for different
sequence lengths and variation in the number of gene
copies analysed [69,70]. The overall nucleotide diversity
estimate was calculated by averaging the number of loci
over all screened (ranged from 8 to 30; Table 2). As the
analysed transferrin locus is reported to be under selective
constraints in salmonids [55], it was excluded in the estimation of the overall nucleotide diversity.

Authors' contributions
HJR carried out the molecular genetic analyses, performed
