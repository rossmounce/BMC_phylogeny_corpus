Abstract
Background: The Gram-positive bacterium Enterococcus faecium is an important cause of nosocomial infections in
immunocompromized patients.
Results: We present a pyrosequencing-based comparative genome analysis of seven E. faecium strains that were
isolated from various sources. In the genomes of clinical isolates several antibiotic resistance genes were identified,
including the vanA transposon that confers resistance to vancomycin in two strains. A functional comparison
between E. faecium and the related opportunistic pathogen E. faecalis based on differences in the presence of
protein families, revealed divergence in plant carbohydrate metabolic pathways and oxidative stress defense
mechanisms. The E. faecium pan-genome was estimated to be essentially unlimited in size, indicating that
E. faecium can efficiently acquire and incorporate exogenous DNA in its gene pool. One of the most prominent
sources of genomic diversity consists of bacteriophages that have integrated in the genome. The CRISPR-Cas
system, which contributes to immunity against bacteriophage infection in prokaryotes, is not present in the
sequenced strains. Three sequenced isolates carry the esp gene, which is involved in urinary tract infections and
biofilm formation. The esp gene is located on a large pathogenicity island (PAI), which is between 64 and 104 kb
in size. Conjugation experiments showed that the entire esp PAI can be transferred horizontally and inserts in a
site-specific manner.
Conclusions: Genes involved in environmental persistence, colonization and virulence can easily be aquired by
E. faecium. This will make the development of successful treatment strategies targeted against this organism a
challenge for years to come.

Background
Enterococci are Gram-positive commensals of the gastrointestinal tract of humans and other mammals. Currently, more than 30 species in the genus Enterococcus
have been described [1]. The two most studied enterococcal species are E. faecium and E. faecalis, which are
genetically distinct as shown by their 16S rRNA
sequences and the sequences of the housekeeping gene
atpA [2]. Both E. faecium and E. faecalis are an

important cause of infections in hospitalized, immunocompromized patients [3]. Historically, E. faecalis has
caused 90% of all enterococcal infections, but since the
late 1980s a rapid increase in nosocomial E. faecium
infections has occurred [4,5]. This expansion of E. faecium in the hospital environment coincided with the
swift acquisition of multiple resistance mechanisms
against many antibiotics. Resistance to ampicillin and
vancomycin are probably the most significant resistance
traits that have been acquired by E. faecium since the
1980s and nowadays the majority of E. faecium clinical
isolates are resistant to these antibiotics. In contrast
with E. faecium, resistance to ampicillin and vancomycin

in E. faecalis is still a relatively rare trait [6,7]. Treatment of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant E. faecium is currently a clinical challenge and the few
remaining therapeutic options are jeopardized by the
emergence of resistance to new classes of antibiotics
[8,9]. Therefore antibiotic-resistant E. faecium, together
with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, is currently seen as one of the gravest threats to successful
therapy presented by Gram-positive bacteria [10].
Several studies have shown that the E. faecium strains
that cause infections in hospitalized patients are different from the strains that colonize the gastro-intestinal
tract of the healthy human host [11-13]. Population
biology-based studies using multilocus sequence typing
(MLST) suggested that the large majority of strains isolated from nosocomial infections belong to a distinct
genetic lineage termed Clonal Complex 17 (CC17)
[14,15]. In a previous study, in which comparative genome hybridization was used to assay diversity in E. faecium, more than 100 genes were found to be enriched
in E. faecium CC17 isolates. Insertion sequence (IS) elements were the most prominent group of genes
enriched in CC17 but, in addition, genes with a proven
or proposed role in E. faecium virulence were also specifically identified in CC17 isolates [11].
Only two genes in E. faecium have been experimentally verified to contribute to virulence in animal models. These are the large surface protein Esp, which has a
role in biofilm formation and urinary tract infection
[16,17] and the MSCRAMM (Microbial Surface Components Recognizing Adhesive Matrix Molecules) Acm,
which is an adhesin of collagen and contributes to endocarditis [18,19]. The hyl gene, which was proposed to
encode a protein functioning as a hyaluronidase, is primarily found in clinical isolates and is much less common in E. faecium strains from other sources [20].
Although a hyl deletion mutant has not been described,
the conjugative transfer of a plasmid containing the hyl
gene made the transconjugant more virulent in a mouse
peritonitis model, suggesting a role for the hyl gene in
virulence [21]. In addition, binding to extra-cellular
matrix components of a number of other surface proteins has also been shown experimentally and these proteins may contribute to virulence of E. faecium by
acting as adhesins [22-24]. However, animal experiments
of deletion mutants in the genes encoding these proteins
need to be performed to further characterize the role (if
any) of these proteins in E. faecium pathogenesis. The
acquisition of genes conferring an infectious phenotype
to E. faecium is thought to be a recent phenomenon,
and coincides with the global emergence of E. faecium
as a nosocomial pathogen since the late 1980s [15].
Molecular studies into the biology of E. faecium have
so far been hampered by the poor genetic accessibility

of this organism. Additionally, there has long been a
marked lack of genome sequence information for E. faecium and consequently there exists a need for a multistrain genomic analysis of E. faecium with the aim to
describe its fundamental biology and to determine the
causes of its emergence as a nosocomial pathogen.
In recent years, alternatives to Sanger-based genome
shot-gun sequencing have been developed. These ‘nextgeneration’ sequencing technologies are characterized by
dramatically higher throughputs and lower costs for
sequencing than Sanger-based sequencing methodologies. Pyrosequencing, which is also known as 454
sequencing in reference to the company 454 Life
Sciences (Branford, CT, USA) that markets pyrosequencing platforms, currently appears to be the most widely
used next-generation sequencing method for de novo
microbial genome sequencing [25]. While next-generation genome sequencing methods can be used to rapidly
sequence a genome to completion in cases when no or
very few repetitive elements are present [26], a more
typical outcome is a draft genome assembly consisting
of relatively large contigs which essentially cover the
entire genome, but where gaps are caused by repetitive
elements that are allocated to, generally small, separate
contigs [27]. Pyrosequencing-based genome analyses of
several micro-organisms of medical importance have
recently been performed and have demonstrated the
contribution of genomic islands for the development of
pathogenicity and the large genetic diversity that can be
contained within a single bacterial species [27-29].
In this study we use pyrosequencing-based genome
sequencing of seven E. faecium strains to quantify the
genomic diversity and determine core- and pan-genome
size and to identify genomic differences between E. faecium and E. faecalis. The genome analysis of E. faecium
also led to the identification of a large pathogenicity
island that is associated with the esp gene. This study
will provide a starting point for genome-wide studies to
develop targeted strategies against this emerging nosocomial pathogen.

Results
Genome sequencing of seven E. faecium isolates

Four of the sequenced strains (E1162, E1636, E1679, and
U0317) originated from human infections and consequently are referred to collectively as infectious isolates
in this study. Strains E980 and E1039 were isolated from
the faeces of healthy human volunteers. Strain E1071
was isolated as part of a hospital surveillance program
in a Dutch hospital. This surveillance program was instigated because of an ongoing outbreak of vancomycinresistant enterococci in the hospitalized patients. E1071
was isolated from a patient not suffering from an enterococcal infection and subsequent typing of the isolate

van Schaik et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:239

showed that it was different from the strain causing the
outbreak.
Prior to genome sequencing, MLST was used to determine the sequence type (ST) of the selected isolates.
MLST is currently widely used for population studies of
E. faecium and is based on DNA sequence analysis of
seven housekeeping genes [30]. MLST of the seven
selected isolates showed that they all had different STs
and represented a sufficiently diverse sample of the species E. faecium. Two of the sequenced strains (E1162
and U0317) were assigned to CC17. The sequenced
strains were chosen to cover a large period of time, with
the most ancient strain being from the year 1961
(E1636) and the most recent from 2005 (U0317). The
relevant characteristics of the sequenced isolates are
summarized in Table 1.
The genomes of the seven selected E. faecium strains
were sequenced using pyrosequencing technology [27]
on the GS-FLX platform. The E. faecium genome
sequence data obtained in this project are summarized
in Table 2. Lander-Waterman statistics [31] estimate
that more than 99.9% of each genome was sequenced.
The genome sequences revealed roughly identical %G+C
content, average gene size and %protein coding DNA
for all strains. The quality of the generated sequences
was evaluated using the Phred-like quality scores that
are linked to these reads. Only between 0.027% and
0.196% of bases had quality scores lower than 20, which
represents a small chance (1 in 100) for a mis-called
base [27]. Thus, we conclude that these draft genome
sequences are of good quality and can be used for
further analyses. There is considerable variation in the
number of assembled bases between the seven genomes,
suggesting large differences in the size of the chromosome between strains and/or the variable presence of
large plasmids. To determine the presence of large plasmids in the seven isolates of which the genome was
sequenced we performed pulsed-field gel electrophoresis
(PFGE) with S1 nuclease digestion of whole genomic
DNA (Additional file 1). This revealed that in all isolates

Page 3 of 18

plasmids with sizes >50 kb are present. Four of the
sequenced strains (E980, E1636, E1679 and U0317) have
mega-plasmids that range in size between 200 and 240
kb. The variable presence of large plasmids between the
isolates is therefore an important cause of the variation
in number of assembled bases that was observed in
these genome projects.
Functional categorization by COG (Cluster of Orthologous Groups [32]) classification of the predicted proteome of the sequenced strains (Additional files 2 and
3) revealed a largely identical functional repertoire in
the seven sequenced strains with the largest variance
between strains in the percentage of proteins assigned
to COG functional category L (replication, recombination and repair).
Identification of antibiotic resistance determinants in
the sequenced isolates

We determined antibiotic resistance profiles of the
sequenced isolates by broth microdilution and linked
the observed resistances to the presence of resistance
genes (Additional file 4). These data show that strains
that have been isolated recently from hospitals (either
from patients that were colonized by E. faecium or suffered from E. faecium infections) are multi-resistant,
while the human commensal strains E980 and E1039
have not acquired broad resistance to antibiotics. Practically all observed antibiotic resistant phenotypes could
be linked to the presence of one or more different antibiotic resistance genes, most of which appear to reside
on plasmids as can be concluded from the presence of
plasmid replication or toxin/anti-toxin genes for plasmid
maintenance on the same contigs as the antibiotic resistance genes. Two strains (E1071 and E1679) were found
to be resistant to vancomycin. Both these strains carry
the vanA transposon. In strain E1071 the vanA transposon is of the A2 type [33], in which a copy of an
IS1216V-IS3 like element has inserted at the left end of
the vanA transposon, which results in the deletion of
the first 120 bp as compared to the archetypal Tn1546

vancomycin resistance element described by Arthur et
al. [34]. In addition, a single nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) was identified in the vanX gene at position 8234
(G®T) of the vanA transposon, resulting in the substitution of a lysine to an asparagine in VanX. In strain
E1679 the vanA transposon is essentially identical to the
Tn1546 element [34] with only a single SNP (G®A)
occuring at position 5663 resulting in the substitution of
an alanine by a threonine in the VanS protein.
In addition, strains E1162, E1679 and U0317 are highlevel resistant (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)
>200 μg/ml) to ampicillin and have point mutations that
are known to confer resistance to this antibiotic [35] in
the pbp5 gene. Strain E1636, which is low-level resistant
to ampicillin (MIC = 25 μg/ml), does not have these
mutations. Presumably, other mechanisms, such as an
elevated expression of pbp5 [36] could play a role here.
The two strains (E1679 and U0317) that are resistant to
ciprofloxacin both carry point mutations in the gyrA
and parC genes, which have previously been described
to be associated with resistance to ciprofloxacin [37].
On the basis of MLST, the multi-drug resistant strain
E1071 groups with isolates from piggeries and healthy
humans in a clonal complex that is generally not linked
to human infections [15,38,39]. Genome analysis of
E1071 suggests a possible pig origin of this strain on the
basis of two observations. Firstly, E1071 was found to
contain the tcr gene cluster, which confers resistance to
copper [40]. Another putative copper detoxification system (EfmE1071_1339 to EfmE1071_1341) was also identified in E1071. This finding suggests a porcine origin of
E1071 as resistance to copper in E. faecium is selected
for in pigs because this metal is used as a growth-promoting feed supplement [41]. Secondly, the base pair
found at position 8234 of the vanA transposon also suggests a porcine origin of E1071. The observed nucleotide
T at position 8234 is associated with porcine isolates
while a G at this position would indicate a strain originating from poultry [42]. Strain E1071 may therefore be

representative of E. faecium strains that can be easily
transferred between pigs and humans and may therefore
shuttle antibiotic resistance genes between these niches.
COG-based functional comparison between E. faecium
and E. faecalis

A more detailed COG-based functional comparison
between E. faecium and E. faecalis was performed to
identify characteristics that distinguish these two species.
A total of 70 COGs (Additional file 5) were present in
all of the E. faecium genomes sequenced in this study,
while being absent in six publicly available E. faecalis
genome sequences. The reverse analysis, in which COGs
were identified that are present in all E. faecalis genomes and absent from E. faecium, showed that 140
COGs are specific for E. faecalis (Additional file 6).
The COG-based comparison of E. faecium and E. faecalis revealed important differences between both organisms in sugar metabolism, particularly of the pentose
sugar arabinose. The ability to use arabinose by E. faecium can be used to distinguish E. faecium from E. faecalis [43] but further characterization of the metabolism
of this sugar in E. faecium has not been performed. In
other lactic acid bacteria [44], the isomerization of arabinose to ribulose is the first step in the metabolism of
this sugar. This reaction is predicted to be catalyzed by
the E. faecium protein belonging to COG2160, which is
not present in E. faecalis. Subsequently ribulose can be
phosphorylated, after which the resulting intermediate
ribulose-5-phosphate is further metabolized through the
phosphoketolase pathway in which phosphoketolase
(COG3957) is responsible for the crucial conversion of
xylulose-5-phosphate to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
(GAP) and acetyl-phosphate [44]. GAP is then further
used as a substrate in the Embden-Meyerhof pathway.
In E. faecalis proteins belonging to both COG2160 and
COG3957 are absent and this probably explains the
inability of E. faecalis to ferment arabinose. E. faecium
also has COGs dedicated to the uptake of arabinose

van Schaik et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:239
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/239

(COG4213, COG4214) and the degradation of arabinose-containing oligo-saccharides (COG3940), all of
which are absent from E. faecalis.
The presence of COGs in E. faecium that are specifically involved in the metabolism of arabinose suggests
that E. faecium has adapted its metabolism to include
plant polysaccharides or their degradation products as
energy sources since arabinose occurs abundantly in
nature as subunits of hemicellulose. The ability of E. faecium to utilize carbon sources from plant origin is also
exemplified by the presence in all E. faecium strains of
proteins belonging to COG5424, which is predicted to
be involved in the metabolism of pectin or its degradation products, and to COG3479, which is likely to be
involved in the breakdown of coumaric acid and other
components of lignocellulose as has been shown for a
similar protein (81% amino acid identity to the E. faecium ortholog) in Lactobacillus plantarum [45]. Again,
none of these COGs are present in E. faecalis. In contrast, a number of COGs that are unique to E. faecalis
are linked to its previously described ability to use ethanolamine as a carbon source during anaerobic growth in
the presence of cobalamin [46]. Ethanolamine is a common head group of phospholipids and is therefore abundantly present in the gut as part of the host’s diet.
Another metabolic difference between E. faecium and
E. faecalis was predicted in the first step of gluconeogenesis from pyruvate, i.e. the conversion of pyruvate
into phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). In E. faecium, pyruvate
can be converted by pyruvate carboxylase to oxaloacetate and subsequently PEP is formed from oxaloacetate
by the action of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase
(COG1866). In E. faecalis, the latter enzyme is not present and PEP is formed directly from pyruvate by the
enzyme pyruvate phosphate dikinase (COG0574).
The COG-based comparison of E. faecium and E. faecalis also revealed differences in proteins involved in the
protection against oxidative stress. In contrast to E. faecalis [47], E. faecium does not have the enzyme catalase,
but it has other mechanisms putatively targeted at oxygen detoxification. One of these mechanisms is a peroxiredoxin and a corresponding reductase (COG3634).
While E. faecalis also has proteins with a similar function (EF2738-EF2739 in the V583 genome [48]), the
E. faecium proteins are not orthologous to these E. faecalis proteins, but instead are related to a similar and
biochemically characterized system in Thermus aquaticus with 81% and 61% amino acid identity for the peroxiredoxin and its reductase, respectively [49]. Another
possible defense mechanism to oxidative stress is provided by glutathione (g-GluCysGly; GSH), which can be
synthesized by both E. faecium and E. faecalis [50]. The
reduced form of glutathione, together with the enzyme
gluthatione peroxidase, can detoxify reactive oxygen

Page 5 of 18

species, resulting in the formation of GSSG [51]. E. faecium has a glutathione peroxidase (COG0386), but
E. faecalis does not have this particular enzyme, suggesting that in E. faecium glutathione may play a more prominent role in the oxidative stress response than in E.
faecalis. In contrast to E. faecium, E. faecalis is capable
to respire aerobically in the presence of heme due to a
cytochrome bd-type respiratory oxidase (COG1271 and
COG1294; [52]), which leads to the production of substantial amounts of reactive oxygen species [53]. This
particular selective pressure may have led to divergent
evolution of the oxidative stress response in E. faecium
and E. faecalis.
Phylogenomic and diversity analysis of the E. faecium
genome

Phylogenomic trees for the seven E. faecium isolates
were constructed based on concatenated alignments of
649 orthologous proteins in the genomes (Fig. 1A) and
based on the overall gene content of the genomes (Fig.
1B). Fig. 1A is a maximum likelihood tree based on
mutations in conserved proteins among the seven
sequenced isolates and is therefore indicative of the evolutionary distance between the sequenced strains. Fig.
1B is a neighbor joining tree with shared gene content
as distance measure (Additional file 7) and represents
the differences between the strains caused by gene gain
and loss. Both analyses resulted in phylogenomic trees
of nearly congruent topology and demonstrate that
strain E980 is evolutionary distinct from the other six
sequenced isolates, which are more closely related to
each other. While the evolutionary distance between
these six isolates (as compared to E980) is relatively
small, there are considerable differences in gene content
between strains. This observation indicates that gene
gain and loss, rather than evolutionary descent, appears
to be the most important driving force in determining
fitness of a given E. faecium strain in a specific environment. There is no evidence for a recent common ancestor of strains which have been isolated from an
infection (E1162, E1636, E1679, and U0317). However,
the two strains from CC17 (E1162 and U0317) appear
to share a more recent common evolutionary history
compared to the other isolates. While E1162 and U0317
appear to be relatively closely related to each other
based on the alignment of orthologous proteins, there is
a remarkably large difference (11.7%) in gene content
between these two strains.
To further quantify the intra-species diversity of E. faecium, the coding sequences (CDS) predicted from the
seven genomes were compared by a highly sensitive
all-vs-all sequence alignment. Subsequently, the new
gene discovery rate was estimated by fitting a least
squares power law (Fnew(n) = new n-a) to the median

number of new genes calculated for all strain combinations (Fig. 2A). The value for the exponent adetermines whether the pan-genome can be considered to
be essentially unlimited in size (“open”; a ≤ 1) or to
have a finite size (“closed”; a > 1) [54]. In the case of
E. faecium, the estimated value for a is 0.88 ± 0.02 signifying an open pan-genome and a high genomic
diversity between E. faecium strains. To estimate the
total size of the gene pool available to E. faecium (i.e.,
the E. faecium pan-genome), an analysis was performed using the same all-vs-all sequence alignment in
which both genes that were shared and genes that are
strain specific were counted. A least squares power law
(F pan (n) = pan n g ) was fit to the medians and the
resulting g value of 0.17, being > 0, is again indicative
of an open pan-genome [54] and confirms that new E.
faecium genes will continue to be identified as more
genomes are sequenced.

The size of the core genome was estimated by fitting
an exponential curve to the median number of CDS
conserved across all the genomes calculated for all strain
combinations (Fig. 2B). The core genome size of E. faecium was estimated to be 2172 ± 20 CDS. This value
shows that a sizeable fraction of the E. faecium genome
is accessory. In E1039, which has the smallest genome
in our data set, 16% of the genome is non-core, while
this quantity increases to 29% in U0317.
Bacteriophages in E. faecium

Analysis of the accessory genome of the E. faecium

contribute significantly to the genomic diversity in E.
faecium (Table 3). CDS of predicted phage origins make
up between 2.3% (E1071) and 5.1% (E980) of the total
number of CDS of the genome. In all isolates a significant fraction of these CDS are strain-specific, indicating

the unique nature of the phage elements that are present in each genome. No CDS of phage origin were
found to be specifically associated with infectious isolates. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
repeats (CRISPR) consist of short, conserved repeats
interspaced by variable sequences and provide immunity
against foreign genetic elements. CRISPRs have been
identified in approximately 40% of sequenced eubacterial
genomes and are associated with cas genes that are
essential for the antiviral function of CRISPRs [55]. In
three of the sequenced strains (E1071, E1679 and
U0317) CRISPR-loci could be identified but in all strains
the CRISPR locus is located inside a gene. The protein
that is encoded by this gene is homologous to plasmid
replication initiator proteins in other lactic acid bacteria.
It seems unlikely that the gene’s internal repeat
sequences act as genuine CRISPRs. In addition, none of
the sequenced E. faecium strains contain a homolog of

the cas1 gene (COG1518), which is a universal marker
for CRISPR-associated genes [55,56]. Thus, there is no
evidence to suggest that a functional CRISPR-Cas system is present in the sequenced E. faecium strains and
this may explain their diversity in prophage sequences.
The fully sequenced E. faecalis V583 strain also does
not contain the CRISPR-Cas system and its genome
contains a number of prophage elements. These findings
are in contrast to E. faecalis strain OG1RF [57], which
has a CRISPR-locus and associated cas genes. Interestingly, the E. faecalis OG1RF genome does not contain
prophage sequences [57].
In five of the seven sequenced E. faecium strains
phages could be activated by mitomycin through observation of phage particles by transmission electron
microscopy of the culture supernatant (Fig. 3). All these
phages had an isometric head with a long non-contractile segmented tail, which is characteristic of the Siphoviridae. Siphoviridae are a very common family of
bacteriophages of the lactic acid bacteria [58,59]. While
head-sizes are similar (~40 nm), there is marked variation in the size of the tails, ranging from ~70 nm in the
E1679 phage to ~220 nm in the E1039 phage.
Phage lysates were tested for their infectivity but plaque formation was not observed (data not shown). This
may be explained by a defect in infectivity of the phage
particles, but it may also be possible that the prophages
that are integrated into the different genomes protect
the host against extra phage infection [60].

pathogen, the proteomes predicted to be encoded by the
genomes of the strains that were isolated from human
infections (E1162, E1636, E1679, and U0317) were compared to the predicted proteomes of the non-infectious
isolates (E980, E1039 and E1071). This revealed that a
group of 26 orthologous proteins are conserved in all
infectious strains, while being absent in the non-infectious strains (Additional file 8). To estimate the relevance of this particular number of shared proteins, we
performed a similar analysis to identify proteins shared
between all possible four combinations of genomes,
while being absent in the remaining three genomes.
This analysis showed that the average number of shared
proteins in a combination of four strains, while being
absent in the three other strains is 3.7, with a median
value of 2. The 26 shared proteins between infectious
strains and absent from non-infectious strains represent
the highest value for all possible combinations. Seven of
the 26 proteins that occur solely in infectious isolates
are IS elements of different families. These may contribute to the genomic flexibility in E. faecium and thereby
facilitate the sequential acquisition of adaptive elements.
In addition, an ABC transporter with unknown substrate
specificity is also found to be specific for infectious isolates. Other proteins that are conserved in all infectious
isolates have predicted roles in plasmid replication or
have a putative function as phage type integrases/recombinases. Finally, a number of hypothetical proteins are
only present in infectious isolates, two of which are predicted to be located in the cytoplasmic membrane.
The presence of the known virulence genes esp, hyl
and acm in the sequenced isolates was also analyzed.
The esp gene was found in strains E1162, E1679 and
U0317. The hyl gene is only present in U0317. A fulllength acm gene is present in E1162 and U0317. In
other strains this gene is either inactivated by insertion
of a transposon (E980 and E1071) or by mutations that
introduce a premature stop-codon (E1039, E1636, and
E1679). This finding is in line with previous research,
which has shown that interrupted acm genes are common in strains not belonging to CC17 and that an intact
acm gene may have contributed to the recent emergence of CC17 as a nosocomial pathogen [61].

Identification and mobilization of an E. faecium
pathogenicity island

Three sequenced strains (E1162, E1679, and U0317)
harbor the esp gene, which encodes an approximately
200 kDa protein that is anchored to the peptidoglycan
of the cell wall through the presence of an LPxTG-type
motif. In E. faecium, Esp is involved in biofilm formation and urinary tract infection in a mouse model
[16,17]. In a previous study, the esp gene was proposed
to be carried on a pathogenicity island (PAI), but only
14 kb of the PAI was sequenced in a single strain and
the integration site of the PAI was not resolved [62]. By
using the genome sequences of the esp + strains and
after additional sequencing of PCR products that were
generated to span gaps between contigs, we were able
to complete the sequence of the esp containing PAI for
all three strains. This revealed that esp is carried on a
large PAI in E. faecium that is considerably larger than
the 14 kb of sequence that was previously obtained [62]
as it varies in size between 64 kb (in E1162), 104 kb (in
E1679) and 68 kb (in U0317) (Fig. 4). There is some
variation in the %G+C-content of the esp PAI (35.7% %
G+C in E1162; 36.6% in E1679; 35.4% in U0317). This
is 1.1 to 2.3% lower than the average %G+C-content
over the entire genome of these strains, indicating that
the DNA of the esp PAI is acquired exogenously. In
E1162 and E1679 the esp PAI is flanked by an imperfect
54-bp direct repeat (Additional file 9), with the left
repeat being the 3’ end of the rpsI gene (which codes
for the ribosomal protein S9) and the right repeat just
upstream of a small gene encoding a 9 kDa protein
with unknown function. In U0317 the 3’ end of the PAI
is inserted at the same genomic location as in the other
strains and is flanked by the repeat sequence, but the 5’
end has integrated downstream of the tuf gene. The
rpsI gene is present in this strain, but only a small element, which is identical to the 5’ part of the E1679 esp
PAI, is found downstream. This suggests that the complete esp PAI in U0317 has originally inserted downstream of rpsI, but that since then a genomic
rearrangement event has occurred, which finally
resulted in nearly the complete esp PAI reintegrating
downstream of tuf.

Figure 4 Sequence alignment of the esp PAI in E. faecium E1162, E1679 and U0317. The red-colored bands represent matching regions
between the esp PAIs. A small blue band represents the inversion of a transposase fragment between E. faecium E1162 and E1679. Arrows
indicate CDS and direction of transcription. The yellow arrows indicate the fragment of the esp PAI, that is identical to a fragment of the PAI of
E. faecalis MMH594 [46]. The green arrows indicate the CDS that are homologous to EfaB5. The purple arrows in E1679 indicate the CDS
predicted to encode the pathway of inositol metabolism. Orange arrows indicate transposases and integrases. White arrows indicate flanking
genes that are not part of the esp PAI. The positions of the rpsI, tuf and esp genes are indicated.

The sequence of large parts of the esp PAI is conserved
between the three strains and diversity within the esp
PAI is mainly caused by the variable presence of genetic
elements. The most striking insertion in the esp PAI has
occurred in E1679 and consists of a 7-kb gene cluster
near the 5’ end of the PAI, which encodes a complete
pathway for inositol metabolism. Of the seven
sequenced isolates, only E1679 is capable of using inositol as a carbon source (data not shown), suggesting that
the metabolic pathway encoded by this element is functional. In all strains, a 10-kb element is present in the 5’
part of the PAI that is essentially completely identical (=
98% nucleotide identity) to a gene cluster (EF0093 EF0106) in the 154-kb pathogenicity island of E. faecalis
MMH594 [63]. Interestingly, this E. faecalis PAI also
carries the esp gene. The presence of these regions of
identical DNA in both E. faecium and E. faecalis PAIs
suggests a recent transfer of genetic material between
these two species or acquisition from a third source.
The function of this gene cluster in both E. faecium and
E. faecalis is unclear. Three CDS of the element are predicted to encode ribosomal proteins and among the
other encoded proteins are a membrane protein putatively functioning as a multi-drug transporter and membrane proteins that appear to be involved in the uptake
of manganese. Interestingly, manganese uptake systems
have been linked to virulence in various Gram-negative
and Gram-positive bacteria [64]. Another gene which
can play a role in host-cell interactions is found on the
extreme 3’ end of the esp PAI. This gene encodes a 120
kDa LPxTG-type cell wall anchored protein that is 91%
identical to the EcbA protein from E. faecium DO,
which was shown to acts as an adhesin to the extracellular matrix components fibrinogen and collagen [24].
The 3’ end of all three esp PAIs is closely related (90%
nucleotide identity) to an element termed EfaB5 [65] in
E. faecalis (encoded by EF1875 - EF1889 in E. faecalis

V583). In its turn, the EfaB5 element is closely related
to the conjugation module of Tn916.
Previously, the esp gene was shown to be transferable
by conjugation between two E. faecium isolates [66] but
no further analysis of the transfer of the esp gene was
performed in this study. Our observation that esp is
located on a PAI led us to reinvestigate the mobilization
of esp, to assess if the esp PAI is completely or partially
transferred and if the esp PAI inserts in a site-specific
manner. We performed filter mating experiments with
E. faecium E1162Δesp (a derivative of E1162 with a
chloramphenicol resistance cassette inserted in the esp
gene [16]) as donor strain and BM4105RF as recipient.
Transconjugants were picked up with a frequency of 1.6 ×
10-7 per recipient cell. Insertion of the PAI in the recipient strains was confirmed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) (Fig. 5A) with subsequent Southern
blotting with a probe for the non-deleted part of esp
(Fig. 5B). This showed that a single fragment in the
transconjugant had increased ~60 kb in size and hybridized with the esp probe, which corresponds to transfer of the complete esp PAI of E1162. To determine
the insertion site of the esp PAI in the transconjugants,
we also probed the blot with a PCR fragment covering
the putative integration site and found an identical
~60 kb increase in size of the hybridizing band, showing that the esp PAI has inserted at the same chromosomal location (i.e. downstream of the rpsI gene) as in
E1162. These data were also confirmed by performing
PCRs with primers that annealed to the flanking
regions of the esp PAI and the 5’ and 3’ ends of the
esp PAI (Fig. 5C) and subsequent sequencing of the
PCR products (data not shown). Our data show that
the complete PAI can be transferred from an esp PAI
carrying strain to an esp- strain and inserts in a sitespecific manner directly downstream of the rpsI gene.
Moreover, due to the use of an esp deletion mutant as

donor in the conjugation experiment, we can conclude
that the Esp protein is not essential for this process.
Remarkably, in the strains E980, E1071 and E1636,
which do not harbor the esp PAI, other elements have
inserted in the same locus, suggesting that this is an
important hot-spot for integration and recombination in
E. faecium. These elements are considerably smaller
than the esp PAI. In E980, a 9-kb element encodes a
phosphotransferase (PTS) system and a glycoside hydrolase (family 38). In E980 a deletion of 5 genes that form
the right flanking region of the esp PAI has occurred. In
both E1071 and E1636, different elements (both 8 kb in
size) have inserted into the putative hot spot. They
encode no obvious functions, but the presence of two
distinct repA-like genes indicates that these elements are
integrated plasmids. In both E1071 and E1636 the
inserted elements are flanked by the 54-bp direct repeat
(Additional file 9).

B), and covering the 3’ end of the esp PAI and the 3’ flanking end
of the insertion site (reactions C). The marker (M) is Invitrogen’s 1 Kb
Plus DNA Ladder. Note that, because of the size of the esp PAI, no
products can be obtained in PCRs with primers on the 5’ and 3’
flanking regions of the esp PAI integration site in esp+ strains.

Discussion
In the last two decades E. faecium has emerged as a
nosocomial pathogen in severely immunocompromized
patients. Successful treatment is increasingly hampered
by antibiotic resistance, and consequently, E. faecium
infections are associated with considerable morbidity
and high mortality [10]. To obtain a better understanding of the basic biology of E. faecium and to estimate
the diversity contained within this species we sequenced
the genomes of seven E. faecium strains that were isolated from different ecological niches. This is the first
study which employs genome sequencing for the study
of this important nosocomial pathogen.
Resistance to several antibiotics was observed in all
sequenced isolates and these phenotypically observed
resistances could generally be linked to the presence of
previously described resistance determinants in the isolates. Isolates from clinical sites were particularly rich in
antibiotic resistance genes. The association of the antibiotic resistance genes with mobile genetic elements
that we observed in the seven isolates under study here
is in line with previous studies [67] and suggests that E.
faecium may serve as an important hub for the transfer
of antibiotic resistance genes to other intestinal bacteria
[68,69].
A comparison between E. faecium and E. faecalis
revealed differences in the occurence of several protein
families between the two organisms. In particular, E.
faecium has several metabolic pathways dedicated to the
metabolism of carbohydrates of plant origin, which are
absent from E. faecalis. This suggests an evolutionary
adaptation to a lifestyle as a gut symbiont of herbivorous

van Schaik et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:239
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/239

or omnivorous animals and may also enable E. faecium
to survive on plant surfaces from which it can frequently
be isolated [70]. The proteins tentatively involved in the
protection against oxidative stress in E. faecium are very
different from those in E. faecalis. The oxidative stress
response of E. faecalis has been characterized in considerable detail and appears to be linked to virulence [71].
Interestingly, exogenous production of hydrogen peroxide by E. faecium has been identified as an important
virulence factor in a Caenorhabditis elegans model of
infection [72]. Understanding how E. faecium can protect itself from the reactive oxygen species that it produces itself or to which it is exposed to in neutrophils
or macrophages during infection, may provide important
insights into the process by which E. faecium can cause
disease.
This study also provides novel insights into the population structure of E. faecium, which has so far been
defined by MLST. Upon analysis of the MLST data
using the algorithm eBURST, it has been suggested that
the large majority of strains isolated from nosocomial
infections group in a distinct cluster, termed CC17 [14].
However, the use of MLST in combination with the
eBURST-algorithm to describe the population structure
of E. faecium has been disputed as high recombination
rates in E. faecium, in combination with a relatively low
mutation rate, results in unreliable phylogenetic inferences by eBURST [73]. Recently, an analysis of the
MLST database for E. faecium using novel and more
advanced algorithms than eBURST has suggested that
the STs constituting CC17 have in fact evolved independently from different ancestral clones [74]. The phylogenomic analysis presented here (Fig. 1) provides a
detailed insight into the evolutionary descent of the
seven sequenced strains and can be used to further
refine our understanding of the evolution of E. faecium.
In this study, two of the seven sequenced isolates
(E1162 and U0317) have been assigned to CC17 on the
basis of MLST. Our genomic data, combined with the
recent insights obtained by MLST, suggest that the
CC17 isolates appear to have formed a sub-population
in the E. faecium species. However, it is also clear that
these infectious isolates are not strictly clonally related
to each other and have diversified considerably. In addition, the large differences in gene content observed here
show that even in strains that are relatively closely
related on the level of their core genome, the gain and/
or loss of mobile genetic elements is the leading force in
determining strain-specific properties.
The pan-genome analysis of E. faecium indicated that
the total available gene pool within this species is essentially unlimited. This may be explained by its ability to
incorporate foreign DNA into its gene pool and by the
wide variety of ecological niches, such as the

Page 11 of 18

mammalian gastrointestinal tract and foods, that E. faecium can colonize. This allows the organism to come
into contact with many pathogenic and non-pathogenic
bacteria and sets the scene for extensive horizontal gene
transfer between E. faecium and others. A consequence
of the open pan-genome of E. faecium is that it can
rapidly acquire genes that have the potential to increase
fitness under adverse environmental conditions. This is
most obvious in the accumulation of antibiotic resistance genes in clinical isolates (Additional file 4). In
addition, genes that allow for infection of the immunocompromized host may also be acquired and introduced
into the E. faecium gene pool, as is exemplified by the
esp PAI.
Lysogenic bacteriophages have so far not been studied
in E. faecium, but they make an important contribution
to the genomic diversity of E. faecium. It has been
hypothesized that lysogenic bacteriophages should confer some advantage to the host, because otherwise they
would be lost due to competition with non-infected
strains. They may also increase the environmental fitness of the lysogenic host in a process termed lysogenic
conversion, which has been described to add to the virulence of several Gram-positive pathogens such as Streptococcus pyogenes and S. aureus [60]. It remains to be
determined to what extent bacteriophages contribute to
niche adaptation and an infectious phenotype in E. faecium, but the wide variety of phages that has been identified in this relatively small sample of strains show that
they have a major role in shaping the genome of E. faecium. The absence of a functional CRISPR-Cas system
in the sequenced E. faecium isolates may make these
strains relatively susceptible to phage attack, resulting in
a high diversity of integrated prophages. The CRISPRCas system has also been implicated in the spread of
antibiotic resistance genes among staphylococci [75]. It
is currently unknown if the CRISPR-Cas system also
acts as a barrier to the acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes in enterococci.
The esp gene of E. faecium is more abundant in clinical isolates than in isolates from food or environmental
origins [76,77] and contributes to biofilm formation and
urinary tract infections in an animal model [16,17].
Here we show that esp is carried on a large pathogenicity island. Also in E. faecalis, the esp gene is harbored
on a large pathogenicity island of approximately 150 kb
in size. This E. faecalis PAI also carries the genes
needed for the production of cytolysin, an exotoxin that
contributes to E. faecalis virulence [64]. In E. faecium
we have not observed a homolog of the E. faecalis cytolysin and in fact most other genes of the E. faecalis
pathogenicity island as described in strain MMH594
[63] are absent in the E. faecium esp PAI. The exceptions to this rule are the esp gene itself and the 10-kb

van Schaik et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:239
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/239

gene cluster described above, which is completely conserved between the esp PAIs of E. faecium and E. faecalis. The presence of this conserved element suggests
recent horizontal transfer of these genes between E. faecium and E. faecalis or, possibly, the independent acquisition of this element by E. faecium and E. faecalis from
another common source. Horizontal transfer may also
explain the presence of the EfaB5 element on the 3’ end
of the esp PAI in E. faecium. This element is part of a
larger family of conjugative and integrative elements in
many Gram-positive bacteria. Exchange of specific modules in these elements appears to be a relatively common event. The esp PAI may, therefore, be the result of
the serendipitous accumulation of several genetic elements in the hot spot provided by the rpsI gene in the
E. faecium genome. Interestingly, also in Streptococcus
agalactiae several mobile genetic elements have been
found to be integrated downstream of rpsI [78], suggesting that this gene forms a hot spot for genomic diversity
in different Gram-positive bacteria.
Even though the overall architecture of the esp PAI
is identical in all sequenced isolates, there are also
marked differences between the esp PAIs in the three
different isolates described in this manuscript. These
are mainly caused by the independent acquisition of
other elements, such as the putative inositol metabolic
pathway in strain E1679. This shows that recombination in the esp PAI is an ongoing process. Because the
esp PAI is mobilizable, as demonstrated here by the
conjugative transfer of the PAI between the strains
E1162Δesp and BM4105RF, the esp gene and the other
genes that are carried on the pathogenicity island may
spread rapidly through E. faecium, thereby contributing
to the ability to infect immunocompromized human
hosts.

Conclusions
In summary, we have performed the first genome-based
study of the nosocomial pathogen E. faecium. We found
that the isolates originating from the hospital have
acquired multiple antibiotic resistance genes and, in
addition, have genes that may play a role in the colonization and infection of hospitalized patients. Genome
sequencing of multiple isolates allowed us to determine
a genome-based phylogeny of E. faecium and to accurately quantify the substantial genomic diversity between
strains in this species. This analysis showed that the two
strains belonging to CC17 in our data-set were relatively
closely related on the basis of their core genome but
still have a large difference in gene content, suggesting
that gain and loss of mobile genetic elements, rather
than evolutionary descent, is the most important driving
force in determining virulence-associated properties in

Page 12 of 18

this clonal complex. The variable presence of lysogenic
bacteriophages in the sequenced strains was found to be
an important contributor to the intra-species diversity of
E. faecium. We also identified characteristics that distinguish E. faecium from the related nosocomial pathogen
E. faecalis, particularly in the repertoire of genes
involved in sugar metabolism and the response to oxidative stress. Finally we show that three isolates have
acquired a large PAI that is associated with the esp gene
and we provide evidence that horizontal gene transfer
between E. faecium and E. faecalis may have occurred
during the evolution of this PAI.
While E. faecium currently has a lower virulence
potential than other cocci with a low-%G+C content,
such as S. aureus and pathogenic streptococci, its resistance to antibiotics has made it one of the most difficult-to-treat nosocomial pathogens. The genomic
flexibility of E. faecium allows the efficient integration of
additional fitness determinants to the E. faecium gene
pool, leading to the rapid adaptation to new environmental niches such as those that are found in hospitalized patients. Genome-wide studies, which will be
facilitated by the sequence data presented here, are
therefore needed to increase our understanding of the
basic biology of E. faecium and to identify genes that
are essential for colonization and infection of hospitalized patients.

Methods
Strains, growth conditions and DNA isolation

The origins of the E. faecium strains of which the genome was sequenced are presented in Table 1. Stocks for
these strains were stored at -80°C in Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) broth with 30% glycerol. Freezer stocks were
streaked on Tryptic Soy Agar supplemented with 5%
sheep blood (Becton Dickinson, Alphen aan den Rijn,
The Netherlands). Single colonies were picked to inoculate 5 ml BHI. These cultures were grown for 18 hours
at 37°C with shaking at 150 rpm and subsequently cells
were pelleted by centrifugation at 4000 g for 10 min.
Genomic DNA was isolated from the cell pellets using
the Wizard Genomic DNA Purification kit (Promega,
Leiden, The Netherlands) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. MLST was performed as previously
described [30]. It should be noted that we did not separate chromosomal DNA from plasmid DNA in the DNA
preparations that were submitted for sequencing as it
has been reported that many important characteristics
of E. faecium (such as antibiotic resistance and virulence
genes) are encoded on plasmids [21,79-81]. Plasmid
content of the seven isolates was determined by PFGE
on S1 nuclease treated total DNA according to previously published methods [81]

Genome sequencing and annotation

Genome sequence data were generated with the GS FLX
system (454 Life Sciences, Branford CT). A library of
single-stranded template DNA fragments was prepared
from the purified genomic DNA using the GS FLX
Standard DNA Library Preparation Kit (Roche, Almere,
The Netherlands). The Shotgun GS FLX Standard
emPCR Kit I (Roche) was used for emulsion-based clonal amplification of a single-stranded template DNA
library. The GS FLX Standard LR70 Sequencing Kit
(Roche) was used in combination with the GS FLX
Standard PicoTiterPlate Kit (70 × 75; Roche) to determine the nucleotide sequence of the immobilized and
clonally amplified DNA library. All kits were used
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
obtained sequences were de novo assembled using Newbler (454 runAssembly software, version 1.1.02.15).
The contig sequences of each strain were concatenated with the sequences NNNNNCACACACTTAATTAATTAAGTGTGTGNNNNN, which puts stop
codons in all six reading frames, and the concatenated
DNA sequences were submitted to the Annotation Service of the J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI; Rockville
MD, USA) [82], where they were run through JCVI’s
prokaryotic annotation pipeline. Included in the pipeline
is gene finding with Glimmer [83], Blast-extend-repraze
searches [84], HMM searches [85-87], TMHMM
searches [88], SignalP predictions [89] and automatic
annotations from AutoAnnotate. The automated annotations produced by the JCVI Annotation Service were
curated manually. rRNA genes in the genomes were
identified using RNAmmer [90]. The whole genome
sequence data described in this paper have been deposited under the following accession numbers: Enterococcus faecium E980: [Genbank:ABQA00000000];
Enterococcus faecium E1039: [Genbank:ACOS00000000];
Enterococcus faecium E1071: [Genbank:ABQI00000000];
Enterococcus faecium E1162: [Genbank:ABQJ00000000];
Enterococcus faecium E1636: [Genbank:ABRY00000000];
Enterococcus faecium E1679: [Genbank:ABSC00000000];
Enterococcus faecium U0317: [Genbank:ABSW
00000000].
The annotated proteins were assigned to Cluster of
Orthologous Groups (COG) by performing a sensitive
search using the Smith-Waterman algorithm against the
COG database as described previously [91] with a cutoff of E < 0.01. For the COG-based comparison of
E. faecium with E. faecalis the protein files corresponding to all the E. faecalis genome sequences (strains
ATCC29200, HH22, TUSoD Ef11, TX0104, TX1332 and
V583) that were available at the time of analysis were
downloaded from the NCBI Genomes website and
COGs were assigned as described above. CRISPR loci in

Page 13 of 18

the genome sequences were detected by CRISPRFinder
[92]. The occurence of CRISPR-associated cas genes was
determined by the presence of a protein belonging to
COG1518, which serves as the universal marker of
CRISPR-associated genes [38,39]. Metabolic pathway
mappings were performed using the KEGG Automatic
Annotation Server [66]. The NCBI BLAST package [93]
was used to compare protein and DNA sequences. DNA
sequence comparisons were visualized with the Artemis
Comparison Tool (ACT [94]). ACT comparison files
were generated through DoubleACT [95], with a cut-off
score of 1 × 10-10.
Construction of phylogenomic trees

A phylogenomic tree based on the concatenated alignment of conserved protein sequences was constructed.
First, proteins were selected that fitted the following criteria: (i) proteins that could be assigned to a COG and
were the only protein present in this COG, and (ii) the
COGs containing a single protein should be present in
all seven sequenced genomes. One COG was removed
manually from this dataset because of large inter-strain
variation in the protein sequences which is caused by
the assignment of non-orthologous proteins to the same
COG. The resulting protein sequences, belonging to
649 different COGs, were subsequently aligned using
MUSCLE [96]. These alignments were concatenated
after which a maximum likelihood tree was constructed
using PHYML [97], including bootstrapping with
1000 iterations. The resulting tree was visualized in
SplitsTree4 [98].
To generate a phylogenetic tree based on gene content, pair-wise BLAST comparisons of the proteins
encoded for each possible genome pair were performed.
Proteins-pairs were scored as conserved between two
genomes when the two proteins were each other’s best
BLAST hits and had an identity of ≥ 90%. The distance
between two genomes was then calculated as 1 - [number of conserved CDS/number of CDS in smallest genome]. Based on this resulting distance matrix, a
neighbour-joining tree was constructed and visualized
using SplitsTree4 [98].
Determination of antibiotic resistance in E. faecium

The MICs of the antibiotics ampicillin, chloramphenicol,
ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, spectinomycin,
streptromycin, tetracycline, and vancomycin against the
seven E. faecium strains of which the genomes were
sequenced, was determined in a broth microdilution
assay in cation-adjusted Muller-Hinton Broth (Oxoid,
Basingstoke, United Kingdom) according to previously
published methods [99,100]. Antibiotics were obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich (Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands).

Pan- and core-genome analysis

The new gene discovery rate, and the size of the panand core-genome were estimated for E. faecium. All-vsall WU-BLASTP [101] and all-vs-all WU-TBLASTN
searches were performed on the seven E. faecium genomes. Results from these two searches were combined
such that WU-TBLASTN hits prevented missing gene
predictions from producing false-negatives. Hits were filtered using 50% sequence similarity and 50% coverage,
as previously described previously [102]. The number
(N) of independent measurements of the core genes
(those shared by all E. faecium isolates) and new genes
present in the n th genome is N = [S]!/[(n - 1)!· ([S] n)!], where S = 7, the number of sequenced strains. To
reduce the number of required computations 1,000
measurements were randomly sampled for each value of
n. The new gene discovery rate was modeled by fitting
the power law function Fnew(n) = new n-a to the median
number of new genes calculated for all strain combinations where n is the number of strains, and new and a
are free parameters. An a ≤ 1 indicates an open pangenome while a > 1 indicates a closed pan-genome [54].
The pan-genome itself represents the trend of the complete gene repertoire as more genomes are sequenced.
The median number of shared and new genes was calculated for all strain combinations and a power law Fpan
(n) = pan ng where n is the number of strains and new
and g are free parameters. g > 0 indicates an open pangenome [54]. The number of core genes was estimated
by fitting the exponential decay function Fcore(n) = core
exp [-n/τcore] + tgcore(θ) to the median number of core
genes calculated for all strain combinations. n is the
number of sequenced strains and core , τcore , tg core(θ)
are free parameters. tgcore(θ) represents the extrapolated
number of core genes assuming a consistent sampling
mechanism and a large number of completed sequences.
Bacteriophages in E. faecium

A first group of putative CDS of bacteriophage origin
were identified based on the annotation (as phage proteins or with “prophage functions” as predicted cellular
role) provided by the JCVI Annotation Pipeline. The
phage origins of these proteins were further confirmed
by BLAST searches which resulted in the identification
of homologous proteins of bacteriophages in Firmicutes.
These analyses were then expanded to include genes
that appeared to form part of a complete or partial
phage genome on the basis of the presence of one or
more prophage modules in a larger gene cluster.
The activation of bacteriophages in the sequenced
E. faecium strains was studied by exposing E. faecium
cultures in the exponential growth phase (A660 = 0.2) to
1 μg/ml mitomycin, followed by a further incubation for
18 h at 37°C. These phage lysates were centrifuged

Page 14 of 18

(4150 g, 5 min) and 6-ml filter-sterilized aliquots of the
supernatant were then ultracentrifuged at 81,000 g for
2 h. Pellets were washed with 0.1 M ammonium acetate,
pH 7.5, followed by another ultracentrifugation step
(81,000 g, 2 h.) and resuspended in 100 μl 50 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.5, 86 mM NaCl, 17 mM MgSO4. Transmission electron microscopy with negative staining using
uranylacetate was performed on these samples as
described previously [22].
Infectivity of the phages was tested by the soft-agar
layer technique. BHI plates were covered with BHI with
4% bacteriological agar, which was inoculated at 0.5%
with an overnight culture of an indicator strain. As indicators the seven strains of which the genome was
sequenced in this study were used. After the soft agar
layer had cooled down to room temperature, 10 μl aliquots of the filter-sterilized phage lysate was spotted on
the plates. Subsequently, plates were incubated overnight at 37°C, followed by visual inspection for phage
plaques.
Identification and mobilization of the E. faecium esp PAI

To close the sequence of the contigs containing the esp
PAI in E1162, E1679 and U0317 sequence alignments
were generated with the genome sequences of strains that
did not carry the esp gene and previously published
sequence of the genes immediately flanking the esp gene
[62]. This resulted in a putative order of contigs surrounding the esp PAI, which was then confirmed by designing
primers (sequences available on request) on the contig
ends, followed by PCR (using AccuPrime™ Taq DNA Polymerase High Fidelity; Invitrogen, Breda, The Netherlands)
and Sanger-sequencing of the generated PCR products.
Assembly of the esp PAIs based on the generated
sequences of gap-spanning PCRs and the contig sequences
was done using Seqman 4.0 (DNAStar, Madison WI).
The mobilization of the esp PAI was studied by performing filter-mating experiments with strain
E1162Δesp [16], which carries a chloramphenicol resistance cassette that is integrated in the esp gene, as
donor strain and strain BM4105RF, a rifampicin and
fusidic acid resistant derivative of the plasmid-free strain
E. faecium BM4105 [103], as recipient strain. Overnight
cultures of these strains were diluted 1:20 in BHI broth
and further cultured at 37°C until A 660 = 1.0. Subsequently, 1 ml aliquots of both cultures were mixed,
spun down (2 min, 14,000 g), and after washing the cell
pellet with phosphate buffered saline (PBS; 138 mM
NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 140 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 1.8 mM
KH2PO4, adjusted to pH 7.4 with HCl), the cells were
resuspended in 30 μl BHI. The cell suspension was
spotted on a nitro-cellulose filter (25 mm diameter, 0.45
μm; VWR, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) that was
placed on Tryptic Soy Agar supplemented with 5%

van Schaik et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:239
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/239

sheep blood. After overnight incubation, the filter was
resuspended in 1 ml BHI and serial dilutions of this cell
suspension were prepared in PBS. Aliquots of 200 μl
were spread on BHI plates containing chloramphenicol
at 10 μg/ml (for quantification of the number of cells of
the donor strain), on BHI plates containing rifampicin
and fusidic acid, both at 25 μg/ml (for quantification of
the number of cells of the recipient strain), and on BHI
plates containing all three antibiotics, to isolate transconjugants. Transconjugation efficiency was calculated
as the viable counts on the BHI plates with chloramphenicol, rifampicin and fusidic acid divided by the viable
counts on BHI plates with rifampicin and fusidic acid.
This assay was perfomed in triplicate. Potential transconjugants were tested for presence of the esp gene by
PCR as described previously [104]. PFGE on SmaIdigested total DNA was performed as described previously [105] to confirm that the transconjugant had the
same genetic background as E. faecium BM4105RF.
Lamba Ladder PFG Marker (New England Biolabs, Ipswich MA) was used to estimate the sizes of the PFGE
fragments. Southern blotting and probe hybridization
was performed as described previously [16]. The probes
used in the hybridizations were generated by PCR with
the primer-pairs esp.14F (5’-AGATTTCATCTTT
GATTCTTGG-3’) and esp.12R (5’-AATTGATTCTTTAGCATCTGG-3’), and DO1.F (5’-GCTTACTTACTCGTGACGC-3’) and DO1.R (5’-GAAAAGTTAGG
ATTAAGGTAACTGC-3’) on chromosomal DNA of
strains E1162 and DO, respectively. The esp PAI insertion site was also studied using PCRs with primer-pairs
DO1.F and DO1.R, which cover the esp PAI insertion
site, with primer pairs DO1.F and PAIup.R (5’-CAAACATTAAGCTTTTTCACTTC-3’), which cover the 5’
end of the esp PAI and with primer pairs PAIdown.R
(5’-CCAACAATTGCTTGAACAG-3’) and DO1.R,
which cover the 3’ end of the esp PAI and the 3’ flanking end of the insertion site. Due to sequence heterogeneity in the downstream region of the rpsI gene, the
primer DO1.R did not yield a product in PCRs on
BM4105RF and the transconjugant (data not shown).
This primer was therefore replaced by TC1.1R (5’-CG
TCTGAATCGTTGATCTATAAG-3’) in PCRs on
BM4105RF and transconjugant genomic DNA. The 1
Kb Plus DNA Ladder (Invitrogen) was used as marker.
