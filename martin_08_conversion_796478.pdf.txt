Abstract
Astaxanthin is a xanthophyll of great interest in animal nutrition and human health. The market
prospect in the nutraceutics industries for this health-protective molecule is very promising.
Astaxanthin is synthesized by several bacteria, algae and plants from β-carotene by the sequential
action of two enzymes: a β-carotene, 3,3'-hydroxylase that introduces an hydroxyl group at the 3
(and 3') positions of each of the two β-ionone rings of β-carotene, and a β-carotene ketolase that
introduces keto groups at carbons 4 and 4' of the β-ionone rings. Astaxanthin is also produced by
the yeast-like basidiomycete Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous. A gene crtS involved in the conversion
of β-carotene to astaxanthin has been cloned simultaneously by two research groups.
Complementation studies of X. dendrorhous mutants and expression analysis in Mucor circinelloides
reveals that the CrtS enzyme is a β-carotene hydroxylase of the P-450 monooxygenase family that
converts β-carotene to the hydroxylated derivatives β-cryptoxanthin and zeaxanthin, but it does
not form astaxanthin or the ketolated intermediates in this fungus. A bifunctional β-carotene
hydroxylase-ketolase activity has been proposed for the CrtS protein. The evidence for and against
this hypothesis is analyzed in detail in this review.

Review
Carotenoids are an important group of natural pigments
with specific applications as colorants, feed supplements
and nutraceuticals; they are also used for medical, cosmetic and biotechnological purposes. A few of the variety
of natural and synthetic carotenoids available have been
exploited commercially, including β-carotene, lycopene,
astaxanthin, canthaxanthin, lutein and capxanthin [1-4].
Although more than 600 different carotenoids have been
described from carotenogenic microorganisms [5], only
β-carotene, lycopene and astaxanthin are commercially
produced by microbial fermentation. These three compounds have various biological functions such as species-

specific coloration, light-harvesting, photo-protection,
antioxidant, and hormone precursor [6,7]. Dietary carotenoids have beneficial effects delaying the onset of many
diseases such as arteriosclerosis, cataracts, age-related
macular degeneration, multiple sclerosis, cardiovascular
diseases, and some kinds of cancer [4]. For these reasons
the demand and market of carotenoids have grown drastically [8].

Production and use of astaxanthin
Astaxanthin (Fig. 1) is a xanthophyll widely used as a pigment in aquaculture. The all-trans isomer is found in
nature together with small amounts of 9-cis and 13-cis

isomers [9]. Due to its high antioxidant activity, astaxanthin has also health benefits such as cardiovascular disease prevention, immune system boosting, bioactivity
against Helicobacter pylori, and cataract prevention.
Research on the health benefits of astaxanthin is recent
and has mostly been performed in vitro or at the pre-clinical level with humans [10]. Research reports support the
conclusion that a daily dose of ~5 mg of astaxanthin is of
tremendous importance for health management, by protecting cells and body tissues from the oxidative stress
caused by free radicals (singlet oxygen), among other reactive oxidants [11]. Astaxanthin producer companies have
conducted several studies to demonstrate the safety of natural astaxanthin derived from H. pluvialis. A randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled, 8-week trial designed
to determine the safety of astaxanthin in 35 healthy adults
revealed that healthy adults can safely consume 6 mg of
astaxanthin per day [12]. Biotechnological production of
astaxanthin using the yeast Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous
(the sexual state of Phaffia rhodozyma; [13]) or the alga
Haematococcus pluvialis represent an advantage over the
chemical synthesis or its extraction from crustaceans.
Strain improvement programs to obtain astaxanthin overproducing X. dendrorhous strains [14] by gene cloning and
manipulation [15-17] have been described. A new astax-

anthin producing bacterium classified as Paracoccus
carotinifaciens was described by Tsubokura et al. in 1999
[18]. This prokaryote presents a high speed of growth and
an easier extraction process for the astaxanthin produced.
Nowadays natural β-carotene accounts for 15 to 20% of
world demand [19]. A similar demand for natural astaxanthin is now emerging in the multi-billion dollar
nutraceutical market.

The xanthophylls biosynthetic pathway in X.
dendrorhous
The biosynthetic pathway for astaxanthin has been studied in X. dendrorhous [20-23]. The conversion of common
isoprenoid precursors into β-carotene is catalyzed by four
enzymatic activities: (i) geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate
(GGPP) synthase (encoded by the crtE gene), which converts farnesyl pyrophosphate and isopentenyl pyrophosphate into GGPP; (ii) phytoene synthase (encoded by the
crtYB gene), which links two molecules of GGPP to form
phytoene; (iii) phytoene desaturase (encoded by the crtI
gene), which introduces four double bonds in the phytoene molecule to yield lycopene; and (iv) lycopene
cyclase (encoded also by the crtYB gene), which sequentially converts the ψ acyclic ends of lycopene to β rings to

form γ-carotene and β-carotene. The astaxanthin biosynthetic genes crtE [23,24], crtI [25], and crtYB [26] involved
in the steps to β-carotene have been cloned from X. dendrorhous although no linear relationship between their
transcript levels and carotenoid biosynthesis was found
[24].

(called motif 1), that overlaps with one of the H motifs, in
all the NH-di-iron β-carotene hydroxylases. Interestingly,
the β-carotene hydroxylase of the thermoacidophilic
arquea Sulfolobus solfataricus maintains the consensus H
motifs although the rest of the protein has little similarity
to those of bacteria, plant and cyanobacteria.

In bacteria, two additional enzymatic activities convert βcarotene into astaxanthin through several biosynthetic
intermediates (Fig. 1): a ketolase which incorporates two
keto groups at C-4 and C-4' in the molecule of β-carotene,
and a hydroxylase which introduces two hydroxyl groups
at C-3 and C-3'. The existence of a monocyclic pathway
diverging from the bicyclic pathway at neurosporene and
proceeding through β-zeacarotene, 3,4-didehydrolycopene, torulene and 3-hydroxy-3',4'-didehydro-β,ψ-carotene-4-one (HDCO) to the end product 3,3'-dihydroxyβ,ψ-carotene-4,4'-dione (DCD) has also been proposed
[27].

All the β-carotene hydroxylases of this class show putative
transmembrane helices suggesting that they are integral
parts of the membrane systems [30,31]. However, the βcarotene hydroxylase of the alga Haematococcus pluvialis is
not found in the chloroplasts and the conversion of β-carotene into astaxanthin takes place in cytoplasmic lipid
vesicles, but not in the chloroplasts [32]. Expression studies of the β-carotene hydroxylase of H. pluvialis in E. coli
indicate that it may use as substrates either β-carotene or
ketocarotenoids such as canthaxanthin, to form respectively zeaxanthin or astaxanthin [32] (Fig. 1).

The conversion of β-carotene into astaxanthin and other
xanthophylls appears to proceed by different routes in X.
dendrorhous as compared to photosynthetic bacteria,
although the pathway in X. dendrorhous has not been completely elucidated yet (see below).

β-carotene hydroxylases of the non-heme di-iron
type
In general, hydroxylases introduce in their substrates an
oxygen atom from molecular oxygen and require an electron donor to reduce the second oxygen atom to water.
Two major groups of β-carotene hydroxylases are known:
i) non-heme di-iron (NH-di-iron) hydroxylases that are
related to fatty acid desaturases, and ii) cytochrome P-450
monooxygenases.
NH-di-iron hydroxylases have been described in bacteria,
green algae and plants [28]. Phylogenetic analysis of this
class of carotene hydroxylases revealed three distinct
groups corresponding to a) plants and green algae, b)
non-photosynthetic bacteria, and c) cyanobacteria.
Although those three groups have little overall similarity,
they all share four so-called histidine motifs (HX4H or
HX2HH). These motifs are also characteristic of membrane-associated fatty acid desaturases and sterol desaturases.
The β-carotene hydroxylases of the NH-di-iron type
require molecular oxygen, iron, ferredoxin and ferredoxin
oxidoreductase for their activity; it seems that the histidine motifs are required for iron binding and are essential
for the enzyme activity [29]. The histidine motifs are
located in the hydrophylic domains of β-carotene hydroxylases and fatty acid desaturases [29]. In addition, there is
a long conserved amino acid stretch HDGLVHXRXP

Some bacteria have β-carotene hydroxylases of the NH diiron class, but with an enlarged range of substrates. The
enzyme of Paracoccus sp. N81106 (previously classified as
Agrobacterium aurantiacum), a marine bacterium that produces astaxanthin and adonixanthin [33,34], may use as
substrates unsubstituted β-ionone rings and also their 4keto derivatives [35]. The same is true for the β-carotene
hydroxylases of Pantoea ananatis and Pantoea agglomerans
(previously classified as Erwinia uredovora and Erwinia herbicola, respectively) [36].
The myxol-producer marine bacterium Flavobacterium sp.
[36,37] contains a β-carotene hydroxylase that shows low
similarity to other bacterial NH di-iron β-carotene
hydroxylases [38,39]. The enzyme of Flavobacterium sp. is
a 3,3'-β-carotene hydroxylase which is able to convert βcarotene into zeaxanthin and astaxanthin.
In several plants (Arabidopsis thaliana, Capsicum annuum,
Citrus unshiu) there are at least two β-carotene hydroxylases encoded by different genes [29,31,40,41]. The two
hydroxylases of A. thaliana (encoded by chy1 and chy2) are
similar and functionally redundant [42].
In summary, all the bacterial NH-di-iron hydroxylases
have the ability to introduce hydroxyl groups in C-3 and
C-3', but lack ketolase activity. Although all β-carotene
hydroxylases of this class share a similar mechanism for
introducing the oxygen atoms into β-carotene, they show
differences in substrate specificity, thus widening the
range of products with potential industrial interest.

β-carotene hydroxylases of the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase type

Several β-carotene hydroxylases belong to the cytochrome
P-450 monooxygenase protein superfamily. This is a very

large protein family including more than 5,000 monooxygenases distributed in all living beings. They include soluble and membrane-bound enzymes involved in a variety
of catabolic processes and also in the biosynthesis of
many secondary metabolites [43,44].
The enzymes of this class introduce in their substrates one
of the oxygen atoms from molecular oxygen; the second
oxygen atom is reduced to water with consumption of two
reducing power equivalents [45]. The final donor of electrons for the P-450 monooxygenases is NAD(P)H. In
most cases electrons are transferred from NAD(P)H to
ferredoxin by a ferredoxin oxidoreductase that is encoded
by a gene frequently linked to that of the P-450 monooxygenase [46]. In other systems the electrons are transferred
from NAD(P)H to a diflavin reductase (containing FAD or
FMN) and later to the P-450 monooxygenase. The molecular structure of several P-450 monooxygenases is known
[47] and their catalytic mechanism is conserved despite
low similarity between the different groups of enzymes in
this family (see review by Werch-Reichhart and Feyereisen
[45]).
Although the first cloned β-carotene hydroxylases were of
the NH-di-iron type, in recent years several β-carotene
hydroxylases of the P-450 monooxygenase class have
been described in different bacteria [48]. We will limit the
description in this review to that occurring in X. dendrorhous, in comparison with those of other organisms.

acid WX3FX3Y domain occurring in many β-carotene ketolases and an aspartic acid rich sequence DDPDFD next to
the second histidine motif [53].
The β-carotene ketolases encoded by the bkt1 and bkt2
genes of H. pluvialis convert β-carotene to echinenone and
canthaxanthin, but does not accept zeaxanthin as a substrate [50,51], in contrast to the CrtW ketolase of Paracoccus sp.
A different group of β-carotene ketolases are represented
by CrtO of Synechocystis sp. that introduce an asymmetric
keto group in the molecule of β-carotene resulting in the
formation of the monoketolated derivative echinenone
[54]. These classes of ketolases are related structurally to
the CrtI phytoene hydrogenases [55].

The crtS gene of X. dendrorhous encodes a novel
cytochrome P-450 hydroxylase involved in the
conversion of β-carotene into astaxanthin

The biosynthetic pathway for β-carotene has been studied
in X. dendrorhous [20-23]. As indicated above the conversion of common isoprenoid precursors into β-carotene in
X. dendrorhous is catalyzed by four enzymatic activities.
The GGPP synthase is encoded by the crtE gene. Two other
genes encode the three remaining enzyme activities [56].
The crtYB gene encodes a hybrid protein with phytoene
synthase-lycopene cyclase activities [25]. The crtI gene
codes for a phytoene desaturase that catalyzes the introduction of four double bonds into phytoene yielding lycopene [26].

Two enzymatic activities convert β-carotene into astaxanthin through several alternative biosynthetic intermediates (Fig. 1): a ketolase which incorporates two keto
groups at C-4 and C-4' in the molecule of β-carotene, and
a hydroxylase which introduces two hydroxyl groups at C3 and C-3'.

Recently, a gene (crtS) that encodes a novel cytochrome P450 monooxigenase has been cloned simultaneously by
two independent research groups [15,16]. This gene
encodes a cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase that is
involved in the conversion of β-carotene into astaxanthin
and other xanthophylls.

A β-carotene C-4 ketolase (encoded by crtW) has been
found in marine bacteria (Paracoccus sp [35], Brevundimonas sp [38]), soil bacteria (Bradyrhizobium sp [49] and
cyanobacteria) or encoded by the bkt gene in Haematococcus pluvialis [50,51]. These enzymes catalyze the direct
conversion of a methylene group (in the 4 and 4' positions of the β-ionone ring of β-carotene) producing
echinenone and canthaxanthin [52].

The crtS gene (named asy by Ojima and coworkers [16])
was cloned from the genomic libraries of two different
strains X. dendrorhous VKPM Y2410 and ATCC 24203. In
both strains there was a 3166 bp ORF consisting of 18
exons and 17 intron sequences (Fig. 2A). The crtS nucleotide sequence from X. dendrorhous VKPM Y2410 showed
several changes when compared to the sequences from
strains ATCC 2403 and ATCC 96594 (AX 034666). The
changes in these strains do not affect the amino acid
sequence of the CrtS protein [15].

A recent mutational analysis of the β-carotene ketolase of
Paracoccus sp. allowed to identify several features of this
type of enzyme. This protein contains four transmembrane domains, similar to those found in fatty acid desaturases, and two other specific hydrophobic regions that
might be involved in interactions with the carotenoid substrates [53]. In addition, it contains the aromatic amino

A different strain ATCC 96815 (strain Yan-1; [57]) that is
known to be blocked in astaxanthin biosynthesis was
found to contain two mutations: a G1470A change in the
5'-splicing region of intron 8 and a G2268 insertion in exon
13 that causes a change in the reading frame [15,16]. This

mutant strain accumulates β-carotene as shown by HPLC
analyses (Fig. 3) and it is unable to synthesize cryptoxanthin or astaxanthin.

also led to the accumulation of the intermediates cryptoxanthin (monohydroxylated derivative of β-carotene at C3) and zeaxanthin (a 3,3'-dihydroxy-derivative of β-carotene). The production of a small amount of zeaxanthin,
which is not formed in ATCC 96815, suggests that the
CrtS enzyme performs hydroxylation in both β-ione rings
(at the 3 and 3' positions). The lack of formation of the
ketoderivative canthaxanthin (Fig. 3) suggests, in principle, that CrtS has no β-carotene ketolase activity; and that
this activity may be provided by another enzyme(s) existing in X. dendrorhous. In addition ATCC 96815 transformed with the crtS gene produced HDCO (3'-hydroxy3',4'-didehydro-β,ψ-carotene-4-one) that is not formed in
the untransformed ATCC 96815 strain. The introduction
of the crtS gene appears to trigger the action of other
enzymes on the hydroxylated intermediates formed by
the action of CrtS.

The encoded CrtS protein has a molecular weight of 62.6
kDa and shows strong similarity to other P-450 monooxygenases. The encoded protein contains the oxygen binding site (339AGYETS344) including the invariant G340 and
T343 residues common to all cytochrome P450 proteins
[58], the heme-binding domain (488FISGPRACFG497)
thought to be involved in the folding of the heme-binding
pocket [47], and a domain (394ESLR397) found in all cytochrome P450 proteins involved in the maintenance of the
three-dimensional structure [59] (Fig. 2B). Conservation
at the Cys495, which provides the thiolate ligand to the
heme group [60], was also observed.
Phylogenetic studies revealed that the CrtS protein is
closely related to cytochrome-P450 hydroxylases of fungi,
especially to those from the Basidiomycota Cryptococcus
neoformans and Ustilago maydis, and the Ascomycota
Aspergillus fumigatus, Giberella moniliformis and Neurospora
crassa (Fig. 2C). However, it showed insignificant identity
to the crtZ gene product (β-carotene hydroxylase)
involved in carotenoid biosynthesis in bacteria.

Complementation of the X. dendrorhous ATCC 96815 with
the crtS gene has also been reported by Ojima et al. [16].
These authors observed that the formation of zeaxanthin
is suppressed by addition of CrtS inhibitors, confirming
the involvement of this enzyme in the hydroxylation of βcarotene.
It is clear from the experimental results that the CrtS P-450
monooxygenase is a β-carotene 3,3'-hydroxylase that
introduces hydroxyl groups in either monocyclic or bicyclic intermediates resulting in the conversion of β-carotene to zeaxanthin (3,3'-dihydroxy-β-carotene). A
ketolase activity could then convert zeaxanthin to astaxan-

thin. Ojima and co-workers [16] claimed that the CrtS P450 monooxygenase may perform both the hydroxylase
and ketolase reactions and, thus, it is able to convert
directly β-carotene to astaxanthin. However, the evidence
for this hypothesis is difficult to be interpreted and the
final conclusion is dependent upon the presence or not of
a separate ketolase activity in X. dendrorhous that works in
cooperation with CrtS.

Expression of crtS in Mucor reveals β-carotene
hydroxylase activity, but not ketolase activity
To elucidate if CrtS catalyzes the synthesis of ketolated
derivatives in addition to the hydroxylated β-carotene
derivatives, the crtS cDNA was expressed in Mucor circinelloides under the control of the carRA promoter from Blakeslea trispora. Several transformants were shown to contain
the intact expression construction. The untransformed M.
circinelloides produces β-carotene as the main carotenoid
and small amounts of the hydroxylated derivatives β-cryptoxanthin and zeaxanthin. The transformants with the crtS
gene showed increased levels of β-cryptoxanthin and
zeaxanthin (190 to 330%), but keto-derivatives such as
canthaxanthin, echinenone or astaxanthin were not
detected [15]. This result supports the presence of β-carotene hydroxylase activity in CrtS, but argues against the
existence of a ketolase activity in this protein. M. circinelloides appears to lack a separate functional β-carotene
ketolase activity and this activity is not provided in the
heterologous system by CrtS.
The bacterial crtZ and crtW genes were used to transform
M. circinelloides [61], showing that M. circinelloides when
transformed with the CrtW ketolase is able to form
echinenone, canthaxanthin and a small amount of astaxanthin, thus confirming the ability of this fungus to synthesize β-carotene keto-derivatives when a ketolase
activity is provided.

The β-carotene hydroxylase-ketolase
bifunctional protein hypothesis
This hypothesis is based in the introduction in X. dendrorhous PR-1-104 (a β-carotene accumulating mutant
having an uncharacterised mutation(s); [62]) of the separate bacterial crtZ (encoding a β-carotene hydroxylase) or
the bkt gene from H. pluvialis (encoding a β-carotene ketolase; [52]). HPLC analyses of the transformants revealed
that X. dendrorhous PR-1-104 [crtZ] transformants produced the hydroxylated β-carotene derivatives cryptoxanthin and zeaxanthin, whereas clones transformed with the
bkt gene produce the keto-derivatives 4-ketotorulene,
echinenone and canthaxanthin. Complementation of the
same mutant PR-1-104 with the crtS gene results in a mixture of hydroxylated and ketolated derivatives. According
to these results, Ojima and co-workers [16] claim the presence of both enzymatic activities in the CrtS protein.

http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/7/1/3

However, it is also possible that each bacterial gene
encoding either a β-carotene hydroxylase or a ketolase are
expressed forming enzymes that can not interact with an
endogenous X. dendrorhous complementing enzyme.
Moreover, the non-hydroxylated derivatives, such as
echinenone and canthaxanthin, are accumulated in X.
dendrorhous when the CrtS activity is inhibited with cytochrome P450 hydroxylase inhibitors [16]. This result is
difficult to explain if there is a single enzyme involved in
the conversion of β-carotene to astaxanthin and suggests
that two enzymes, with P450-hydroxylase activity and
ketolase activity respectively, are involved in the conversion of β-carotene into astaxanthin in X. dendrorhous.
Whether both activities belong to CrtS is an open question, since a separate ketolase (so far uncloned) may occur
in X. dendrorhous. The definitive answer to this question
will only be known when the CrtS enzyme is purified and
in vitro studies are performed. Attempts to gain information by expressing a combination of three genes in E. coli
were not conclusive due to the complexity of the three
plasmid system used and the poor expression of the crtS
gene in this bacterium [16].
A reiterated action of the CrtS hydroxylase activity on βcarotene including a dehydration activity has been proposed by Ojima and co-workers [16] (Fig. 4). In this
model, the conversion of β-carotene into astaxanthin
starts with an hydroxylation at C-4 of one of the ionone
rings of β-carotene that is later dihydroxylated and, by
removal of a water molecule, is converted to the 4-keto
derivative (echinenone) that is subsequently hydroxylated again by CrtS at C-3 (3-hydroxyechinenone) and
finally converted in phoenicoxanthin and astaxanthin. It
is unclear if all those steps are carried out by a single CrtS
enzyme in X. dendrorhous. Other β-carotene hydroxylases
(or ketolases) different from CrtS occur and have been
cloned recently from X. dendrorhous (E. Gudiña and J. F.
Martín, unpublished results).

Future prospects
The growing worldwide market value of carotenoids is
projected to reach over US 1 billion by the end of this decade [63]. The nutraceutical companies have integrated carotenoids in their development strategies based on the
claim of their proven antioxidant properties. Synthetic
astaxanthin dominates the world market but recent interest in natural sources of the pigment has increased substantially. According to Pfander [64], the price in the
market for a dispersion containing 5 to 10% of carotenoid
is about 600 $/kg for β-carotene, 1300 $/kg for canthaxanthin, and 2500 $/kg for astaxanthin. Nowadays, most
of the commercial astaxanthin for aquaculture is produced synthetically from petrochemical sources, with an
annual turnover of over $200 million, and a selling price

of about 2000 $/kg of pure astaxanthin. The interest for
the microbiological production of carotenoids has
increased during the last years due to increasing demand
for the aquaculture market, especially for nutritional salmonids and shrimps.

Understanding the conversion of β-carotene into astaxanthin will open the door for a rational amplification of the
last steps of xanthophylls production, either in X. dendrorhous or in alternative microbial systems like the fungus Blakeslea trispora that is used at present for large scale
β-carotene production but lacks the genetic information

for conversion of β-carotene into xanthophylls [65]. The
possibility of producing β-carotenoid compounds in the
yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae using the genes from X. dendrorhous has also been recently explored [66].

Conclusion

In conclusion, the conversion of β-carotene into astaxanthin in different organisms takes place by the combined
action of a β-carotene hydroxylase and a β-ketolase that
work successively on different intermediates, resulting in
a metabolic grid of reactions and intermediates (Fig. 1).
This wealth of intermediates is of biotechnological interest because it provides new xanthophylls for the animal
nutrition and human health industries. In X. dendrorhous
both activities have been reported to be encoded in a single bifunctional enzyme [16], but this hypothesis has not
been confirmed by other laboratories [15]. Further biochemical evidence is required to elucidate if a single protein contains the two activities or whether there are
separate β-carotene hydroxylase and ketolase activities
encoded by two separate genes, only one of which (crtS)
has been cloned, in this yeast-like basidiomycete.
