Abstract
Background: Results of microbial ecology studies using 16S rRNA sequence information can be
deceiving due to differences in rRNA operon copy number and genome size of the detected
organisms. It therefore will be useful for investigators to have a better understanding of how these
two parameters differ in various organism types. In this study, the number of ribosomal operons
and genome size were separately mapped onto a Bacterial phylogenetic tree.
Results: A representative Bacterial tree was constructed using 31 marker genes found in 578
bacterial genome sequences. Organism names are displayed on the trees using graduations of color
such that similar colors indicate similar numbers of operons or genome size. The resulting images
provide an intuitive understanding of how copy number and genome size vary in different Bacterial
phyla.
Conclusion: Once the phylogenetic position of a novel organism is known the number of rRNA
operons, and to a lesser extent the genome size, can be estimated by examination of the colored
maps. Further detail can then be obtained for members of relevant taxa from the rrnDB database.

Background
The ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes of Bacteria and Archaea
are typically found in operons. Although many organisms
have a single rRNA operon the actual number is known to
vary between 1 and 15 [1]. The operons themselves do not
always exhibit the same sequence but instead different in
a modest number of positions, typically less than 15 in
the case of 16S rRNAs. Nevertheless, there are exceptions.
For example, one of the three 16S rRNA genes in Halobacterium marismortui differs from the others in over 70 positions [2]. Such microheterogeneity has been studied in
detail in a modest number of cases. For example, it has
been recently shown is in Streptomyces coelicolor that all the
operons are expressed and their RNAs incorporated into

ribosomes but the relative expression level may vary over
the growth cycle [3,4]. In the case of H. marismortui, the
aberrant operon responds to temperature differently [5].
Efforts to evaluate the extent of rRNA operon microheterogeneity likely should be handled cautiously. An examination of complete genome sequences revealed many
examples where all the 16S rRNA genes in an organism
with multiple rRNA operons are reported to be identical
[6]. There certainly are cases where multiple rRNAs exist
with the same sequence. However, in the case of the rapidly accumulating bacterial genomes, one must remember
that long nearly exactly repeated regions are difficult to
sequence. Thus, one must consider the possibility that at
least some and perhaps many, of the assembled genomes

distinct colors were used with each assigned to a specific
number of operons. As the operon number increases the

are reporting multiple copies of what are actually consensus rRNA sequences.

sonable assessment of genome size and especially, rRNA
operon copy number.

Although the true extent of microheterogeneity may be
underestimated in the published genomes, the numbers
of operons present is likely reliable. Since 2001 the
number of ribosomal operons has been curated in the
rrnDB (Ribosomal RNA Operon Copy Number Database)
[7,8] for all instances where it is known. The number of
rRNA operons is believed to in part be correlated with
organism ecological strategy [9-11]. Operon number is of
special interest when 16S rRNA sequence information is
used to study the composition of microbial ecosystems
because organisms with larger numbers of copies of the
rRNA operon will be disproportionately represented in
the resulting profiles [12]. Therefore, when attempting to
quantify relative numbers in environmental populations,
it is appropriate to correct the data by taking into account
both the genome size and the number of operons [13].
However, this is potentially problematic as many of the
strains that are encountered have no exact match in the
database and it is therefore not immediately apparent
how many operons are likely to be present or what the
genome size is likely to be. Herein, we examine this issue
by mapping these two traits onto a phylogenetic tree [14].
Once one determines the approximate phylogenetic position of an organism one can use these maps to make a rea-

trimmed and then concatenated by species into a megaalignment [15]. A maximum likelihood tree was then constructed from the mega-alignment using PHYML. The
model selected based on the likelihood ratio test was the

gamma-distribution and the proportion of the invariable
sites were estimated by the program

have multiple chromosomes. In these cases, the total
number of operons in all the chromosomes was used and
the combined mass of the multiple chromosomes used
for genome size. In addition, in some instances the
number of copies of each rRNA is different. This is most
frequent for 5S rRNA, which may be present in an extra
copy. In these cases, the number of 16S rRNA genes was
used as the number of operons as in most practical applications it is 16S rRNA that is being examined. The tree was
combined with the operon and information and built
using Newick format such that each node is specified
by
"specieshttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newick
name*genome-size*rRNA-operon-count". The organism
names on the tree were colored according to either operon
number or genome size. In each case, as the parameter
increases the color generally becomes darker. Thus, for the
operons 14 colors were used. For 0 to 6 operons, shades
of yellow, orange or red were used with darker colors indicating larger numbers of operons. For 7 to 10 operons
shades of blue were used and greens were used for 11 or
more. In the case of genome size, 12 colors were used to
depict various size ranges. The first range was 0-1 MB with
subsequent increments of 0.5 MB. The final range was for
genomes greater than 6 MB in size. The final tree was created in the .esp format using ATV [16].

Results
Bacterial rRNA operon copy number was mapped onto a
phylogenetic tree by coloring the organism names on each
branch in accordance with the number of operons (Figure
1 and Additional file 1). Genome size was separately
mapped in a similar manner (Figure 2 and Additional file
2). These maps allow one to readily visualize the extent to
which these properties have been conserved over phylogenetic distance. In both cases, the values are conserved
within species and frequently within genera as well. In the
case of operon number, similar values are frequently
found in neighboring groupings as well. Overall, rRNA
operon number typically only exceeds six in two regions
of the tree, the γ-Proteobacteria and the Firmicutes, e.g.
Bacillus, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and others [8]. Thus,
if one knows the approximate phylogenetic position of an
organism one can make a reasonable prediction of how
many rRNA operons it will have. As previously noted,
genome size and operon number are largely uncorrelated
with the one exception that organisms with genome sizes
below 1.5 MB almost never have more than one rRNA
operon.
These observations are illustrated in Figure 3, which is
excerpted from Figure 1 and shows a portion of the γ-Proteobacteria. Here one sees that for a large number of enterics (Escherichia, Salmonella, Yersinia etc) the operon
number is typically seven with only occasional strains,
having six or eight operons. Related genera such as Mannheimia and Haemophilus typically have 5 or 6 operons.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/208

However, Candidatus biochmannia and Buchnera strains
have only one operon. The difference here is genome size.
These organisms all have genomes less than 1 MB. The
predictions are of course not perfect, and one will see
occasional exceptions. Thus, in Figure 1, one Actinobacillus strain only has three operons while all of the other
close neighbors have six.

Discussion
The fact that members of the same species generally have
essentially the same number of rRNA operons has been
pointed out previously [6]. However, in the absence of the
type of mapping shown here the phylogenetic extent to
which this is true is not readily recognized. Initial mapping efforts [7] were not fully informative in this regard
due to the modest number of species for which the requisite information was available at the time. Prior work has
shown that rRNA copy number impacts organism life history [7,10]. This suggests that gain or loss of rRNA operons would appear to be a potential method of adapting to
different environments and one might envision numerous individual organisms in populations as having different numbers of rRNA operon. Although rRNA operon
copy number has typically not been examined in multiple
individuals within a population, the high conservation of
numbers within similar species from different sources
argues against this.
The maps provided here will be especially useful to those
seeking to quantitatively characterize microbial ecosystems using 16S rRNA sequence characterizations. The
number of times an organism is encountered must be
adjusted for the size of its genome and especially the
number of copies of the 16S rRNA gene it carries. Once
16S rRNA sequence data is available the approximate phylogenetic position of each organism can be estimated. The
mappings can then be examined to obtain initial estimates of rRNA operon number and genome size by examining the neighboring phylogenetic groupings. With the
relevant phylogenetic groupings identified one can then
use the rrnDB database [8] to obtain the values for all
organisms belonging to those groups.
