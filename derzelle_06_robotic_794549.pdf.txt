Abstract
Background: Enterobacter sakazakii is the causative agent of rare but severe food-borne infections
associated with meningitis, necrotizing enterocolitis and sepsis in infants. Rehydrated powdered
infant formulae have been implicated as the source of infection in several outbreaks and sporadic
cases. In this work, a real time fluorescence resonance energy transfer PCR assay incorporating an
internal amplification control (IAC) was developed for the specific detection of E. sakazakii in foods.
Performance of the assay, coupled to an automated DNA extraction system and the E. sakazakii
ISO-IDF (TS 22964/RM 210) enrichment procedure, was evaluated on infant formulae and samples
from production environment.
Results: The real-time PCR assay had 100% specificity as assessed using 35 E. sakazakii and 184
non-E. sakazakii strains. According to the E. sakazakii strains tested, the detection limits ranged
from 5 to 25 genomic copies. Assays on pure cultures (including real-time PCR and DNA
extraction) gave a sensitivity of about 102 to 103 CFU/ml. Out of 41 naturally contaminated infant
formulae and environmental samples analysed for the presence of E. sakazakii, 23 were positive by
real-time PCR and 22 by the conventional culture method, giving 97.5% concordance with the ISOIDF reference method.
Conclusion: This method, combining specific real-time PCR, automated DNA extraction and ISOIDF standard enrichments, provides a useful tool for rapid screening of E. sakazakii in food and
environmental matrices.

Background
Enterobacter sakazakii, previously known as yellow-pigmented E. cloacae [1], has been identified as the causative
agent of rare but often severe invasive infections in
infants. Neonates and infants less than 2 months of age
appear to be groups at particular risk [2,3]. Meningitis is
the most frequently reported clinical symptom in neonatal E. sakazakii infections [2,4-7]. Infants in whom meningitis developed were generally < 1 week of age at the onset

of infection and had near-term gestational age and birthweight [3]. They frequently develop complications including seizures and brain abscesses, resulting in high
mortality (over 40%) and morbidity. Septicaemia or
necrotizing enterocolitis are also associated with E. sakazakii-related infections [2,4-7]. Compared with infants
with meningitis, infants in whom bacteremia alone developed tended to be born very prematurely and have
extremely low birthweight (<1,000 g). They had generally

surpassed the neonatal period at the onset of their disease
[3]. Mortality among these cases is lower (about 10%)
[2,4-7].
E. sakazakii is emerging as a hazard in powdered infant
formulae (PIF). In several E. sakazakii-related outbreaks
and sporadic cases, PIF was epidemiologically or microbiologically established as the source of infection [8-13].
This organism was however isolated at very low levels
from commercial PIF and dry environmental samples collected from infant formula factories. The contamination
was in most cases not exceeding 1 CFU per 100 g [14-20].
Prompted by the health risks associated with E. sakazakii,
the International Standard Organisation (ISO) and the
International Dairy Federation (IDF) have recently jointly
adopted a Technical Specification (TS 22964), quoted as a
Reviewed Method for IDF (RM 210), defining a method
for the detection of E. sakazakii in PIF. The method is
based on the selective enrichment procedure developed
by Guillaume-Gentil et al. [18]. Isolation of the organism
involves (i) a preenrichment in buffered peptone water
(BPW), (ii) an enrichment in modified lauryl sulfate tryptose broth (mLST), and (iii) a plating on the chromogenic
Enterobacter sakazakii Isolation Agar (ESIA). Identification
include (i) observation of yellow pigmentation for suspected E. sakazakii colonies on tryptone soy agar (TSA) at
25°C and (ii) confirmation of the species via biochemical
characteristics. The isolation and confirmation procedures
usually require 5 to 7 days to be completed.
Although at present, the gold standard for the detection of
microorganisms in food is in general conventional culture, molecular methodologies based on nucleic acid
detection have been successfully developed these last
years. They offer an interesting alternative to rapidly and
specifically identify organisms from a wide variety of
sources. With regards to E. sakazakii detection, several
PCR-based approaches have already been published [2126]. However, some of these methods do not include an
internal amplification control (IAC) that allows a simultaneous assessment of PCR inhibition. Moreover, none of
them have been evaluated with naturally contaminated
food samples, thus not addressing the ecological diversity
of naturally contaminated food matrices.
The present study evaluated a real-time PCR-based assay
including an IAC and an automated nucleic acid extraction method that can be used in combination with the
ISO-IDF enrichment steps for the routine examination of
naturally contaminated PIF.

Results
Specificity of the real-time PCR assay
The DNA region located between the tRNA-glu and 23S
rRNA genes was selected as target for detecting the E. sakazakii species. Primers ESFor and ESRevB were demonstrated to amplify a 158-bp fragment in all 35 strains of E.
sakazakii tested with no cross-reaction with other non-E.
sakazakii bacterial strains (data not shown). Real-time
PCRs were next conducted with a first set of hybridisation
probes in the presence of 450 molecules of IAC. All but
one E. sakazakii strains gave a positive signal in real-time
PCR assay (Table 1). For strain ES 10, we repeatedly failed
to detect any fluorescent signal and this lack of E. sakazakii
specific signal was curiously also accompanied by a lack of
the IAC signal. To attempt to improve the assays, the
ESFor/ESRevB amplified products specific to this strain
were sequenced, as well as those of the strain ATCC
51329, one of the more phylogenetically distinct E. sakazakii strain which displayed one of the higher CT value in
this assay (data not shown). Sequencing of both 158-bp
target fragments did reveal some mismatches between the
LC1ES hybridisation probes and its binding sequences. A
new LC1ES probe incorporating three degenerated bases/
positions compared to the initial one was therefore tested.
The new designed real-time PCR was able to correctly
detect all E sakazakii strains tested, including the ES 10 isolates. The use of a more degenerated LC1ES probe did not
significantly affect the CT value obtained for each strain
but increased the intensity of fluorescence measured for
some of them, including strain ATCC 51329. This new
probe was used in the rest of the study.

For the exclusivity test, a total of 139 non-E. sakazakii
Enterobacteriaceae and 45 non-Enterobacteriaceae strains
were chosen (Table 1). All 184 non-E. sakazakii strains
tested were negative by either PCR or real-time PCR while
a positive IAC signal was always detected (with a CT value
above 37). The new E. sakazakii-IAC real-time PCR developed could therefore distinguish E. sakazakii isolates from
non-target bacteria.
Sensitivity of the real-time PCR assay
Two reference strains belonging to distinct lineages
[21,27] were selected to determine the sensitivity of the
assay. The type strain ATCC 29544 is representative of a
majority of E. sakazakii strains. The previously mentioned
strain ATCC 51329, the Preceptrol™ (quality control)
strain, is more closely related to taxa including E. pyrinus,
E. hormaechei and C. koseri [27].

The sensitivity of the real-time PCR assay in the presence
of 450 molecules of IAC was experimentally determined
by using purified DNA. Tenfold dilutions of E. sakazakii
genomic DNA in the concentration range of 106 to 100
equivalent genome per reaction were amplified in tripli-

cate. Table 2 summarises the mean Ct values obtained for
both strains. A detection limit of 5- and 25-genome copies
was assessed for the strains ATCC 29544 and ATCC
51329, respectively. A positive reaction could however be
detected in some cases with, respectively, as few as 1 and
5 DNA molecules per tube (Figure 1).
To assess the detection limit of the assay combined with
the DNA extraction step, tenfold serial cell dilutions of
calibrated cultures containing 3.6 108 CFU/ml were performed and DNA extracted using the MagNA Pure LC system. Results showed that at least 36 and 360 CFU/ml
(corresponding to 1.8 and 18 cells in the reaction tube)
need to be present to get a positive reaction with the
strains ATCC 29544 and ATCC 51329, respectively (Table
3). 100% of positive reactions were recorded in samples
containing, respectively, 3.6 102 CFU/ml and 3.6 103
CFU/ml. Results showed a linear log correlation over the
10-fold dilution series (Figure 2), indicating that real-time
PCR combined with MagNA Pure DNA extraction system
could be used to quantify E. sakazaki cell suspensions.
Evaluation of the real-time PCR assay coupled with the
ISO-IDF enrichment procedure with artificially
contaminated infant formula samples
Infant formula powders from three different commercial
brands were inoculated with the strains ATCC 29544 or
ATCC 51329 at four levels of contamination (1–5, 5–10,
10–20, 20–200 CFU/25 g) plus negative control. Briefly,
twenty five grams of PIF were dissolved in 225 ml of buffered peptone water and then inoculated with diluted E.
sakazakii culture. The contaminations were carried out in
triplicate, except the blank which was twice repeated.
Samples were analysed in parallel by the conventional
ISO-IDF (TS 22964/RM 210) method and by real-time
PCR after a common cultural enrichment. Both methods
gave the same results for all samples and replicates (Table
4). Non-inoculated samples (blank) were negative. All but

one artificially contaminated samples tested positive for
E. sakazakii, demonstrating that both methods allow the
detection of less than 5 E. sakazakii cells in 25 g of dried
infant formulae. Mean CT values obtained by real-time
PCR ranged from 19 to 26 cycles. As observed for the sensitivity analysis, CT values were systematically higher for
the Preceptrol strain than for the E. sakazakii type strain
ATCC 29544. A slight matrix-dependent effect was also
noticed, with CT values for one of the infant formulae's
brand higher than those of the others brands. In contrast,
no significant difference was observed according to the
contamination level, indicating that E. sakazakii has likely
reached a similar growth density at the end of the enrichment procedure for all samples. The negative result found
for one replicate by both methods suggested that the artificial contamination failed. Heterogeneity in artificial
contamination at low inoculation levels (estimated to 4.5
cells) may explain the likely absence of E. sakazakii in this
sample.
Given the reported presence of E. sakazakii at low level in
PIF, a contamination level of 1 CFU/100 g was also
attempted using the phylogenetically more distinct strain
ATCC 51329 [21]. Out of the 5 replicates performed, 3
were positive for E. sakazakii. As previously mentioned,
the 2 negative ones were likely not contaminated. The
method is therefore able to detect as few as 0.01 cells per
gram of dried infant formulae in as little as 48 h of total
analytical time. In an attempt to further shorten this duration, we also tested whether the assay could be carried out
after a single pre-enrichment of samples in BPW for 18 h.
Equivalent results, with mean Ct values in the same range
as previously found, were obtained (Table 4). The realtime PCR analytical time could therefore be shortened to
about 24 h without reducing the method's sensitivity.

Detection of ES in naturally contaminated samples:
comparison of real-time PCR detection and conventional
ISO-IDF culture method
The presence of E. sakazakii in a total of forty-one samples
suspected to be naturally contaminated, including infant
formulae and samples from the production environment
of infant formulae factories, were investigated using the
ISO cultural method and real-time PCR in parallel (Table
5). Twenty-five grams test portions were analysed in
duplicate for each sample after BPW-mLST enrichments as
recommended by the ISO-IDF procedure. Twenty-two
samples were positive for E. sakazakii by the ISO-IDF
method and 23 were tested positive by real-time PCR, giving more than 97.5% concordance between both methods. The sample (n° 21) that tested positive by PCR and

negative by the culture method had a mean CT of 36.65.
This value, largely higher than those found for the other
positive samples (i.e. 19.15 to 26.82 cycles), indicated a
lower E. sakazakii cell density in the enriched sample.
Extrapolation of this value based on standard curves previously calculated (see Figure 2, Table 3) suggested that
the cell load achieved at the end of the two-step enrichment might not exceed 103–104 CFU/ml. Moreover, when
tested after a single 18 h-BPW enrichment, E. sakazakii was
not detected by real-time PCR in this sample in contrast to
the other 22 positive ones (data not shown), indicating
that growth was actually occurring during the second
enrichment and that a detectable level could not be
reached without a two-days incubation. All together, these
data suggested that the additional PCR-positive sample

the conventional culture method.

homology between sequences of probes and templates.
No false-positive or false-negative result was indeed
obtained, indicating that the FRET real-time PCR assay
developed was highly specific to E. sakazakii.

Discussion
Given the diversity and the limited sequence information
available concerning the E. sakazaki genome, we selected
the 16S–23S rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS)
sequence to design a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (hybridisation-based) real-time PCR assay. This region
has the advantages to be highly conserved throughout
Eubacteriae, to somewhat differ in length and primary
sequence between genus and species, and to be well characterised in numerous species and strains for phylogenetic
purposes. The set of primers ESFor and ESRevB was shown
to be specific enough to distinguish E. sakazakii from
other isolates of bacteria by conventional PCR amplification. They amplified a 158-pb DNA fragment located
between the tRNA-Glu and 23S rRNA genes. Taking
account of the sequence variations encountered in this
region among our collection of E. sakazakii isolates, the
upstream internal probe LC1ES designed was degenerated
in several positions to match the requirement for 100%

The diversity existing between E. sakazakii strains was
found to affect the sensitivity of the real-time PCR results.
CT values varied to some extent for same cell concentration, using different strains. While the detection limit was
approximately 1 to 5 equivalent genome(s) per reaction
for the strain ATCC 29544 (18 cells per PCR tube when
combined with DNA extraction step), it was approximately 25 copies (180 cells per PCR tube when combined
with DNA extraction step) for the phylogenetically more
distinct strain ATCC 51329. The use of a very sensitive
detection method is essential given the presence at low
levels of E. sakazakii in PIF. An enrichment step was therefore included in the real-time PCR method to increase the
bacterial population largely above the detection limit. The
enrichment procedures recommended by the ISO-IDF (TS
22964/RM 210) method was evaluated for this purpose.
This enrichment allowed to detect an initial contamination level of 1 cell per 100 g of PIF.

The PCR sensitivity depends on the efficiency of the
method used to recover bacterial DNA from food. Sufficient nucleic acid extraction, with the removal of substances inhibitory to amplification, is important for an
optimal detection of microbial pathogens by PCR, especially with a complex and rich food matrix such as PIF.
The FRET real-time PCR was therefore combined with a
robust nucleic acid extraction procedure, the MagNA Pure
LC automated DNA extraction system. In this study, it was
observed that by using the MagNA Pure system in combination with a LightCycler, reproducible results could be
obtained with extraction of genomic DNA from PIF suspensions to real-time-PCR in approximately 2 to 3 h.
Another interesting aspect of this system is the high level
of purity of the resulting DNA. PCR detection in PIF is
often hampered by PCR-inhibition problems (unpublished data). In this respect, the method offers a good
DNA purification step prior to amplification and was
shown to be satisfactory for analysis of PIF. Moreover, to
assess PCR inhibition, a competitive IAC template was
incorporated in the design of the assay. All real-time PCR
reactions were performed in the presence of a given
number of its copies. This allowed to distinguish negative
responses due to the absence of target sequence in the
sample from negative responses due to an amplification
failure. All negative results in this study were then systematically validated by the IAC amplification.
Despite the use of an automated DNA extraction system,
matrix-dependent effects affecting real-time PCR results
were noticed. Mean CT values obtained from one of the
three brands of artificially contaminated PIF used were
found to differ from the others, being systematically
slightly higher. The PIF composition is suspected to
directly and significantly affect the PCR assay sensitivity.
Compared to the 2 other brands, the involved PIF contained higher fat and skimmed milk content and was
enriched with starch and Bifidobacterium. In addition, this
powder was more difficult to handle (i.e., separating cells
from the food suspension). The shift in CT values for this
matrix might also reflect less favourable growth conditions which would not support the same cell density as
the other PIF, linked perhaps to the presence of competitive microflora. However, the methodology developed,
combining real-time PCR detection, automated DNA
extraction and enrichment, was able to correctly identify
all samples containing E. sakazakii irrespective of PIF
brand, contamination level and strains analysed.
Reliable detection of pathogens in a timely manner is a
major challenge for product quality control in the food
industry, for official controls and for outbreak investigation. In this respect, an interesting strategy has been
recently reported by Mullane et al. to quickly detect E.
sakazakii in PIF [28]. The developed method requires a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/6/100

short enrichment period (6 h), followed by capture of the
bacteria using charged paramagnetic beads and subsequent identification after plating onto selective agar. Realtime PCR technology coupled to automated nucleic acid
extraction also meets this requirement. However, the
method developed in this work includes a significant
enrichment time that does not enable a same-day analysis. The enrichment procedure recommended by the ISOIDF method that we used involves a pre-enrichment in
BPW for 18 h, followed by an enrichment in mLST for 24
h. To shorten the total analytical time to less than 24 h,
the enrichment step was limited to the single pre-enrichment in BPW. A clear real-time PCR positive signal was
obtained with this one-step enrichment for all artificially
or naturally contaminated samples, previously found positive using the two-step ISO-IDF enrichment, with one
exception. Significant difference in term of CT, with a shift
to more elevated values, were however observed with very
low level of contamination, i.e., 1 CFU/100 g of PIF, and
naturally contaminated samples, indicating a lower cell
density at the time of the analysis for those samples. For
one naturally contaminated sample (n° 21), E. sakazakii
was only detectable by the assay with a two-step enrichment, due to probable late and laborious cell recovery.
The presence in PIF and the environment of infant formulae factories of injured or stressed cells due to the type of
process is plausible. In this case, an increased variability of
individual lag times and of the detection times (i.e., the
time by which a single-cell-generated subpopulation
reaches a detectable level) is expected [29,30]. The second
enrichment in mLST might therefore be useful for samples
containing a low number of injured or stress cells. In this
study, 1 of 41 samples was concerned. The analysis of
more naturally contaminated samples need to be carried
out to assess the frequency of such event and to assess
whether the second enrichment might be omitted without
the risk of false-negative results.

Conclusion
Compared to the ISO-IDF cultural method, a high degree
of agreement with the new developed real-time PCR
method was found. Agreement (100%) was obtained with
artificially contaminated PIF samples and 97.5% with naturally contaminated samples. The PCR detection system
gave one additional positive. This result might suggest
that, besides being significantly faster, molecular methods
could also be more sensitive than the cultural method. In
conclusion, the method developed can be considered as a
fast alternative for identification of E. sakazakii in PIF.

Methods
Bacterial strains
The strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. Thirtyfive E. sakazakii strains, whose identification was confirmed by biochemical test kit (ID32E, bioMérieux, Marcy

Page 8 of 12

BMC Microbiology 2006, 6:100

l'Etoile, France), were used for selectivity testing. These
included twenty-four strains isolated from infant formulaes factories and 5 strains isolated from dehydrated
infant formulae. The E. sakazakii strains were grown aerobically at 37°C in BHI medium. The final BHI culture contained approximately 3.6 108 CFU/ml. A total of 139 nonE. sakazakii Enterobacteriaceae and 45 non-Enterobacteriaceae strains were selected for exclusivity testing (Table
1), with an emphasis on Enterobacteriaceae closely related
to E. sakazakii such as E. gergoviae, E. hormaechei, E. kobei,
E. pyrinus, Enterobacter sp. or Citrobacter koseri (Iversen et
al., 2004). Most of the strains were food and environmental isolates and were representative of food pathogens and
other epidemiologically important species.
Bacteriological method of reference
E. sakazakii detection procedure was performed according
to the ISO-IDF method. Briefly, a non selective enrichment was performed at 37°C in buffered peptone water
(BPW, AES Laboratoires, Combourg, France) for 18 h, followed by a selective enrichment in modified lauryl sulfate
tryptose broth (mLST). One hundred microliters of the
BPW suspension was transferred into 10 ml of mLST and
further incubated at 44°C for 24 h. mLST contains per
litre of deionised water: 35.6 g lauryl sulfate tryptose
broth powder (AES Laboratoires), 29.2 g NaCl (Fisher scientific, Elancourt, France) and 10 mg vancomycin (Sigma,
Steinheim, Germany), pH 6.8. The enrichment broth was
then isolated on ESIA™ selective agar (AES Laboratoires).
ESIA™ plates were incubated at 44°C for 24 h. Typical colonies (blue-green) were streaked on TSA (Oxoid, Dardilly,
France) and incubated at ambient temperature (approximately 20°C) for 72 h to test the production of a yellow
pigment. Presumptive colonies were lastly submitted to
biochemical characterisation, using ID32E strips
(bioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France).
Preparation of DNA samples
DNA purification from pure E. sakazakii cultures or from
food suspensions was performed using the MagNA Pure
LC DNA Isolation Kit III for bacteria and fungi on the
MagNA Pure system (Roche Diagnostics, Meylan, France),
according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
Briefly, a 1-ml aliquot of the enriched culture was collected after centrifugation at 10000 × g for 3 min at 4°C.
The supernatant was carefully discarded and the cell pellet
was washed with 1 ml PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline,
Roche Diagnostics, France). After centrifugation, the cell
pellet was resuspended in 100 µl of PBS and mixed with
130 µl of lysis buffer and 20 µl of proteinase K (Roche
Diagnostics, France). The suspension was incubated successively at 65°C for 10 min and 95°C for 10 min and
allowed to cool down before being transferred to the
MagNA Pure system. DNA was eluted in 100 µl. A 2-µl
aliquot of the eluted DNA was used as template for real-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/6/100

time PCR assay, except for DNA extracted from pure cultures which was 100-fold diluted in water before use.
DNA from pure non-E. sakazakii cultures was mostly
extracted using a 200 µl aliquot of InstaGene™ Matrix
(Bio-Rad Laboratories, Marnes-la-Coquette, France). Bacterial DNA was released by heating the sample for 20 min
at 56°C and 10 min at 95°C. After vortexing and centrifugation (10000 × g, 4°C, 3 min), 2-µl of the supernatant
was used for PCR assay.
DNA of plasmid T104 which contained the IAC construction used as internal amplification control was purified by
using a QIAGEN plasmid midi kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf,
France) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
All DNA preparations were stored at -20°C until use.
Sequencing
Partial DNA sequences of the 16S–23S rDNA internal
transcribed spacer (ITS) from E. sakazakii strains ES 10 and
ATCC 51329 were determined. Primers ESFor and ESRevB
were used to amplify the DNA from both strains using the
Expand high fidelity PCR system (Roche Diagnostics).
PCRs were carried out with a GeneAmp PCR system 9700
thermocycler (Applied Biosystems). A 50 µl PCR reaction
contained 0.4 µM both primers, 200 µM each deoxynucleoside triphosphate (Roche diagnostics), 1 × PCR buffer
without MgCl2 (Roche Diagnostics), 1.7 mM MgCl2, 2.6 U
of High fidelity PCR DNA polymerase (Roche Diagnostics) and 1 µl of genomic DNA (approximately 30 ng). The
reaction conditions were 94°C for 2 min followed by 35
cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 58°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 30 s.
A final extension step of 72°C for 7 min was performed.
The 158-bp amplicon generated was purified using the
QIAquick purification kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and sequenced by 'GenomeExpress' (Meylan, France). The EMBL accession numbers
for those sequences are AM295804 (strain ATCC 51329)
and AM295805 (strain ES 10).
Detection limit of the real-time PCR
The limit of detection of the LC-PCR assay was determined in the presence of a defined number of IAC copies,
by using a serial dilution of purified genomic DNA and a
serial dilution of a culture of known concentration. Ten
ml of TBS (Oxoid, Dardilly, France) were inoculated with
100 µl of an overnight culture of the strain ATCC 51329
or ATCC 29544 and incubated for 6 h at 37°C to the lateexponential growth phase (approximately 4 × 108 CFU/
ml). The cell suspension was next 10-fold serially diluted
in buffered peptone water (Oxoid) to achieve a final concentration range of 108 to 101 CFU/ml. The exact number
of CFU per millilitre was determined a posteriori by plating
100 µl of the 10-5, 10-6 and 10-7 dilutions onto TSA agar

Page 9 of 12

BMC Microbiology 2006, 6:100

(Oxoid) in triplicate and by incubating the plates for 24 h
at 37°C. The average number of CFU from six plates was
used to estimate the concentration. Two 1-ml aliquots of
each dilution were collected by centrifugation and the
DNA was extracted from each cell concentrate and strain
using the MagNA Pure system. A 5-µl aliquot of the eluted
DNA was used as template. The real-time PCR amplification was carried out in the presence of 450 IAC copies as
previously described. PCRs were performed in duplicate.
The genomic DNA purified from E. sakazakii ATCC 51329
or ATCC 29544 used as template was extracted from the
non-diluted cell suspensions mentioned above. It was
quantified by fluorimetry using PicoGreen (Molecular
Probes, Eugene) in a TD-700 fluorimeter (Turner
designs). The number of genomic copies of purified DNA
was calculated as follows: m = n × (1.013 × 10-21 g/bp),
where m is the mass and n is the number of base pairs. The
number of kilobase pairs for one E. sakazakii genome was
assessed to be 4,500 Kb (according to the ATCC BAA-894
genome sequencing project performed at Washington
University-GSC [31]). Consequently, one E. sakazakii
genome weighs about 5.0 fg. Each DNA dilution in the
concentration range of 106 to 1 genomic DNA copies per
PCR (equivalent genome per PCR) was run in duplicate.
Analysis of artificially and naturally contaminated PIF
Infant formulae from 3 different brands were locally purchased at retail, and used to assess the sensitivity in food
matrices of the real-time PCR assay combined with E.
sakazakii ISO-IDF enrichment procedures. Infant formula
powders were artificially inoculated with individual E.
sakazakii strain (strains ATCC 51329 and ATCC 29544) at
four levels of contamination (1–5, 5–10, 10–20, 20–200
CFU/25 g), plus a negative control (blank), and submitted
to the ISO-IDF detection protocol. Experiments were
repeated in triplicate for all contamination levels, except
the blank which was repeated twice. The exact numbers of
E. sazakakii cells introduced into the food were determined a posteriori by plating 100 µl of 10-5, 10-6 and 10-7
dilutions on TSA agar in triplicate and by incubating the
plates for 24 h at 37°C. The concentration was estimated
by calculating the average number of CFU from at least six
plates.

To give an outlook of the analytical procedure, 25 g of the
spiked powdered formula samples were dissolved in 225
ml of BPW and incubated for 18 to 20 h at 37°C. One
hundred microliters of the last suspension were subsequently inoculated into 10 ml of mLST and further incubated at 44°C for 24 h. Two 1-ml aliquots of the
enrichment culture were taken and subjected to DNA
extraction using the MagNA Pure Roche LC instrument.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/6/100

For real-time PCR assays, DNA was extracted from 1-ml
aliquots of either BPW or mLST enrichments in duplicate
and all samples were analysed twice by real-time PCR as
described above. Naturally contaminated samples were
examined as described above. 25 g test portions were analysed in duplicate. All samples were kept closed at ambient temperature before use.
Primers and probes used in real-time PCR
The design of primers and hybridisation probes was based
on a multiple alignment of the intergenic 16S–23S rRNA
sequences including E. sakazakii and other Enterobacteriaceae. The set of degenerated primers ESFor
(5'ATCTCAAAAMTGACTGTAAAGTCACGTT3')
and
ESRevB (5'CCGAARAAGTMTTCGKGCTGCGA3') allowed
to PCR-amplify an E. sakazakii specific target region of
158-bp located between the tRNA-Glu and 23S rRNA
genes. The target probes are two oligonucleotides that are
specific to the internal sequence of the amplified fragment. The upstream probe is labelled at the 3' end with
fluorescein, whereas the downstream probe is labelled at
the 5' end with 640RED fluorophore. The 3' end of the
downstream probe was phosphorylated to prevent probe
extension. During the annealing step of the amplification
cycle, the two probes hybridised to the E. sakazakii template and were only two bases apart to allow FRET
between the two fluorophores. Amplification of the target
sequence is proportional to the fluorescence emitted by
the 640RED dye monitored on the F2 channel of the
Light-Cycler instrument. The internal FRET hybridisation
probes have the following sequences: LC1ES
(5'ACGGA(G/R)(A/R)AATRCA(G/R)CAGCRTGTCT3'Fluo)
and
LC2ES
(Red6405'TTCAATTTTCAGCTTGTTCCGGATTGT3'-Phosphate).
The specific probe used for IAC detection was LC1505'Red705
(Red7055'CTATCCTTGAGCCGTAGGCCACTATC3'-Phosphate).
Generation of fluorescence linked to IAC amplification
was monitored in channel F3 (705 nm). Primers and
probes were purchased by Sigma-Proligo (France).
Construction of an internal amplification control (IAC)
The IAC is a recombinant pMosBlue plasmid DNA (GE
Healthcare Europe, Saclay, France) with ESFor and
ESRevB primer binding regions, flanking a DNA sequence
complementary to the LC1ES and LC150-5'Red705
probes. It was designed to be amplified in the same reaction as the E. sakazakii target region by using the same
amplification primers ESFor and ESRevB. To construct
this plasmid, a chimeric DNA fragment was generated by
two runs of PCR. The first used the genomic DNA of strain
ES1 as template and the set of primers ESCIA
(5'TTAATATCTCAAAACTGACTGTAAAGTC3') and ESCIB
(5'ACGGAGAAATACAGCAGCGTGTCTGTCTATCCTTGA
GCCGTAGGCCACTATCTAAAGAGCAAATATCTCAAAC3'

BMC Microbiology 2006, 6:100

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/6/100

). The second PCR run used the purified first-round PCR
product (thousand-fold diluted) as template and primers
ESCIA
and
ESCID(5'ACAACCCGAAGAAGTCTTCGTGCTGCGAGTT
TGAGAGACTCTGACACACCGCGCATTTCTTATTACGGA
GAAATACAGCAGCGTGTCT3'). PCR conditions were 0.4
µM primers, 200 µM each deoxynucleoside triphosphate
(Roche), 1 × PCR buffer without MgCl2 (Roche), 1.7 mM
MgCl2, 2.6 U of High fidelity PCR DNA polymerase
(Roche Diagnostics) and 1 µl of genomic DNA. The thermal profile consisted of an initial denaturation at 94°C
for 2 min followed by 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at 50°C and 30 s
at 72°C for 40 cycles, and a final elongation at 72°C for 7
min. The amplicon obtained was next purified with the
QIAquick purification kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France)
and cloned into E. coli MOS Blue by using a pMOSBlue
blunt-ended cloning kit (GE Healthcare Europe, Saclay,
France). The resulting plasmid T104 was quantified by
fluorimetry using PicoGreen (Molecular Probes, Eugene)
and a TD-700 fluorometer (Turner designs). The copies'
number of the vector was calculated according to its size.
For use in real-time PCR, the IAC plasmid was freshly
diluted to the working concentration of 180 copies per µl
in double-distilled water. The optimal concentration of
IAC for incorporation into the PCR assay was determined
empirically by adding different numbers of IAC copies to
reactions containing serially diluted E. sakazakii genomic
DNA. The goal was to determine the lowest reproducible
IAC concentration that amplified consistently but did not
interfere with the amplification of the target sequence.

ples. These controls used as template a hundred-fold
diluted purified genomic DNA of E. sakazaki strain ES 1,
water, or 450 copies of IAC, respectively

1.5 instrument (Roche Diagnostics) used a total volume
of 20 µl, which was contained in a glass capillary tube.
Optimisation experiments were first performed to choose
the right IAC concentration and magnesium concentrations. The optimal amplification reaction mixture contained 1× LightCycler Faststart DNA master hybridization
probes mix (Roche Diagnostics), 3 mM MgCl2, 500 nM of
each primer (ESFor and ESRev), 200 nM of each probe
(LCES1, LCES2 and LC150-5'Red705), 450 copies of plasmid T104 (IAC) and 1 to 2 µl of the tester DNA. Thermal
cycling was carried out by using an initial denaturation
step at 95°C for 10 min, followed by 46 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 10 s, annealing at 60°C for 10 s and
extension at 72°C for 15 s, with a temperature transition
rate of 20°C/s except for the annealing step for which it
was 2°C/s. Cycling was completed by a final cooling step
at 40°C for 30 s. Generation of fluorescence for each sample was recorded at the 60°C annealing step in channel
F2/F1 (640 nm) for E. sakazakii target DNA amplification
and in channel F3/F1 (705 nm) for IAC amplification.
Each real-time PCR assay systematically included three
control reactions performed in parallel to the tested sam-

Data analysis
The cut-off values (background fluorescence baseline)
were set above the highest end-point fluorescence signals
of the negative controls. Samples with threshold cycle values (CT) of less than 44 cycles were considered positive.
The CT value indicates the cycle at which sample fluorescence signal is first recorded as statistically significant
above background fluorescence. Usually it occurs when
the signal detection software begins to detect the increase
in signal associated with an exponential formation of PCR
product. The more template is present at the beginning of
the reaction, the fewer cycles it takes to reach this point.

Authors' contributions
FD and SD carried out the PCR experiments. SD designed
the assay and drafted the manuscript. All authors read and
approved the final manuscript.
