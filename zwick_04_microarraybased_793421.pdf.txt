Abstract

Background

information

The current technological model for genome sequencing
employs high-throughput shotgun sequencing at large centers. This highly successful enterprise has completed about
200 bacterial genomes with more than 500 ongoing as of July
2004 [5]. The genome sequences of the B. anthracis Ames
chromosome (5.2 Mb, NC_003997) and plasmids pXO1
(181.6 kilobases (kb), NC_001496) and pXO2 (96.2 kb,
NC_002146) have been determined [6-8], as have the
genomes of three near neighbors, B. cereus ATCC 14579 [9],
B. cereus ATCC 10987 [10] and B. cereus G9241 [4]. A strain
of B. anthracis Ames strain isolated from a victim of the
autumn 2001 bioterror attack in Florida was also sequenced
to a high level of coverage using the random shotgun method

interactions

Population genomics, the study of genome-wide patterns of
genetic variation in a large number of organisms, is emerging
as a vigorous new field of study [1-3]. Rapid, accurate and
inexpensive resequencing could enable a variety of potential
applications and studies. For the biowarfare (BW) pathogen,
Bacillus anthracis, genomic sequences from multiple strains
and non-pathogenic close relatives could aid studies that
definitively identify B. anthracis in environmental and clinical samples, determine forensic attribution and phylogenetic
relationships of strains, and uncover the genetic basis of phenotypic variation in traits such as mammalian virulence.
Moreover, first recognizing the presence of a novel pathogen,
and then attempting the difficult task of discerning between
novel naturally occurring pathogenic organisms (for instance
Bacillus cereus G9241 [4]) and artificially enhanced bacterial
pathogens, requires a thorough knowledge of extant patterns

(discrepancy rate < 2.5 × 10-6). Population genomics studies of microbial pathogens using rapid
resequencing technologies such as resequencing arrays are critical for recognizing newly emerging
or genetically engineered strains.

and compared to the Ames sequence to identify 60 new markers that included single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs),
inserted or deleted sequences, and tandem repeats [11]. The
success of this effort has led to an extensive phylogeny-based
whole-genome shotgun resequencing effort in B. anthracis
(reported by [12]). Whole-genome shotgun studies are
increasingly being used to explore variation among more
closely related bacterial strains [13-15]. However, the relatively high costs of these efforts have limited the extent of
their application.
Numerous molecular methods for genotyping B. anthracis
and near neighbors of the Bacillus cereus sensu lato group
[16] have been developed and successfully employed in a wide
variety of studies. These include DNA sequence surveys from
one or a few number of loci [17-21], repetitive element polymorphism-PCR [22,23] and amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) [24-27]. However, because of the relative
paucity of genetic variation between isolates [28], the most
effective method for subtyping B. anthracis has employed
multiple locus variable number of tandem repeats analysis
(MLVA) [29-31]. Similar to the mammalian short tandem
repeat methodology, MLVA determines strain phylogenetic
relationships based on a relatively few, highly variable
genomic repeat regions. While being relatively rapid and
inexpensive, a key limitiation of MLVA lies in its exclusive
focus on loci with common alleles that are differentiated by
size. Because of the relatively rapid mutational process generating variation at these loci, similarly sized markers may have
different evolutionary origins.
Clearly, a method for rapid, inexpensive genome resequencing of bacterial strains would be of great benefit for genotyping, forensics and studies of the genetic basis of strain
phenotypic variation. Developing DNA-based biodetection
assays depends upon prior knowledge of patterns of genetic
variation within and between bacterial species. It would be
ideal to enable technologies that could combine the high
information content of whole-genome resequencing of
strains while also being rapid and inexpensive like MLVA,
AFLP and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST). Furthermore, while conventional strain typing methodologies have
focused on the utility of common variants, rare variants may
prove to be especially informative for forensic applications.
High-density oligonucleotide resequencing microarrays are a
highly parallel technology that can enable the rapid identification of DNA sequence variants with minimal laboratory
effort and infrastructure [32,33]. Previous applications of
microarrays on bacterial genomes [34,35] or small eukaryotic
genomes like yeast [36,37], focused on methods that scanned
specific genes or a genomic region for genetic variants. Initial
high-throughput microarray applications in the human
genome for SNP discovery [38-40] were successful, but also
reported that between 12% and 45% of the detected variants
were false. Subsequent experimental improvements and the

http://genomebiology.com/2004/6/1/R10

development of the ABACUS algorithm/software package
[32] significantly reduced SNP false-positive ascertainment,
radically improved genotype calling and automatically
assigned quality scores to each genotype call. These fundamental advances enabled rapid resequencing of 40 human
genomic regions [32,41] and ABACUS is now the standard
application for microarray-based resequencing.
Here we present the first microarray-based high-throughput
resequencing of a large collection of B. anthracis isolates. Our
study first reaffirms, and then directly demonstrates that the
quality of microarray-generated DNA sequence data is
directly comparable to that produced by conventional shotgun sequencing. We then estimate the levels of genetic variation in the annotated genomic regions we resequenced,
characterize the frequency spectrum of DNA sequence variants we observe, and finally explore patterns of linkage disequilibrium and recombination among those variants. Because
of the scalability and minimal effort associated with microarray-based resequencing, our work demonstrates the possibility of a rapid and cost-effective method of genome
resequencing that could be applied to both environmental,
and ultimately clinical specimens.

Results
Resequencing B. anthracis with microarrays
A panel of 56 B. anthracis strains from the Biological Defense
Research Directorate's strain collection (see Additional data
file 1) was resequenced using Affymetrix resequencing arrays
(RAs) and base calls determined using the ABACUS software
package [32]. Each RA was capable of resequencing 29,212
base-pairs (bp) or about 0.5% of the B. anthracis genome
from a single isolate sample (see Additional data file 2). Long
PCR sample preparation and chip processing was conducted
for 118 RAs. Analysis of these 118 RAs with the ABACUS software package shows that 115 are successful (97.5%). Experimental failure occurs when less than 60% of the total possible
bases fail to achieve quality scores exceeding the ABACUS
user-defined threshold. For this study, the total threshold was
set at 31 and a strand minimum of -2 [32], as determined
from analysis of a replication experiment described below.
The 115 successful RAs call 92.6% of the possible bases
(3,109,539 bp out of a total possible of 3,359,380 bp). Figure
1 shows the distribution of quality scores across all 3,359,380
base calls. Amplicon failure, typically arising from long PCR
(LPCR) failure, accounts for 1.1% of the uncalled bases. The
remaining base-calling failure (6.3%) consists of features on
the RAs that fail to generate quality scores exceeding the
experimental threshold.
Previous results demonstrated that base-calling failure was
concentrated among RA oligonucleotide probes containing
multiple purines. Purine-rich probes were observed to have
lower hybridization intensities at identical positions across

Building on the recognition of the importance of automated
algorithms to assess data quality [42,43], we used two methods to assess the quality of microarray resequencing data
[32]. The first consisted of a replicate experiment where 51
samples were independently hybridized on 102 RAs. A
parameter search that optimized the percentage of called
bases, while minimizing the number of discrepancies
between replicates was then performed. A total of 1,489,812
bases could have been called in each replicate experiment. At
the optimal parameter values (total threshold of 31, strand

While RA data is highly replicable, repeated systematic errors
would not be detected in a replicate experiment. To obtain an
independent estimate of RA sequence accuracy, we compared
the sequence data from 30 RAs where the same B. anthracis
strain had been sequenced using the random shotgun
approach and deposited in GenBank (B. anthracis: strain

398,467 bp of RA- and shotgun-generated sequence, we
observed 15 discrepancies occurring at six sites. This corresponds to a discrepancy rate of 3.8 × 10-5. If we make the conservative assumption that all discrepancies lie in the RAgenerated sequence, this level of accuracy would correspond
to a phred score of at least 44.

minimum of -2 see Cutler et al. [32]), 90.6% (1,349,178) of
sites are called in both replicates. Other parameter values
provide similar levels of base calling and discrepancy rates.
The optimal parameter values are similar to those previously
used by Cutler et al. [32]. Of the bases called in both replicates, 1,349,177 are called identically. Only one site is called
differently. This corresponds to a replication discrepancy rate
of 7.4 × 10-7 (Table 1). If repeatability could be related to accuracy, then this level of repeatability would correspond to a
phred score of at least 61 [42,43]. This calculation assumes
that the discrepancy rate corresponds to a binomial error
probability of P, where phred = -10 log10P. These replication
levels and discrepancy rates are consistent with those previously reported [32], providing further evidence for the ability
of RAs analyzed with ABACUS to produce highly replicable
data.

multiple RAs. Guanine-rich probes, in particular, showed the
greatest reduction in hybridization intensity (see Figure 6 in
[32]). Consequently, total quality scores at these sites frequently failed to exceed the quality-score threshold and they
remained uncalled. To determine if probe sequence composition, specifically purine and guanine content, contributed to
the 6.3% of bases not called, the sequence composition of the
purine-rich oligonucleotide probes at 4,209 sites successfully
called on all 115 RAs (484,035 total sites) was compared to
that at the 886 sites that failed to be called on any RA
(101,890 total sites). These failed sites account for 3.0% of the
total base calling failure in the experiment. Uncalled sites are
composed of oligonucleotide probes with a significantly
higher purine composition (P < 10-22). A similar pattern is
detected if we limit our analysis to guanine-rich probes (P <
10-9). This latter result is surprising given that the B. anthracis genomic sequences we examined have a low G+C content
(~34%). Nevertheless, these analyses demonstrate that both
purine-rich and guanine-rich oligonucleotide probes are significantly more likely to fail to generate quality scores exceeding the experimental threshold.

To determine if this conservative assumption is warranted,
we examined in greater detail the nature of the RA/shotgun
sequence discrepancies. Five of the discrepant sites, accounting for 10 discrepancies total (twofold RA replication at each
site), were found in Kruger B strain sequences. The one
remaining site, accounting for five discrepancies (fivefold RA
replication at this site), was found in Vollum strain
sequences. At all 15 discrepancies, the RA called a base identical to the Ames reference sequence [8], while the Kruger B/
Vollum shotgun sequence called a new SNP. The fact that the
shotgun sequence called a SNP at every discrepancy was surprising, leading us to examine more closely the level of shotgun coverage and assembly at each discrepant site. A
comparison of the latest shotgun assembly of the Kruger B
strain (J Ravel, et al., unpublished work) with the RA Kruger
B strain base calls agreed with the RA base calls. The latest
Vollum shotgun assembly (J Ravel, et al., unpublished work)
still disagreed at the one site (five discrepancies total), but
this discrepancy was based on a single shotgun sequencing
read with a phred score of 7 at the discrepant base. Clearly,
the shotgun coverage lacks sufficient depth at this site to
make a reliable base call and it seems far more likely that the
fivefold RA base call is correct. Hence, the RA sequence data
has less than one discrepancy per 398,467 bases called, or a
discrepancy rate of < 2.5 × 10-6 (Table 1). This observed level
of sequencing accuracy corresponds to a phred score of 56.
These data demonstrate that our conservative assumption is
not warranted. Resequencing array data quality from a single
experiment matches, and in some cases perhaps exceeds, that
obtained by multiple DNA sequencing reads using conventional DNA sequencing technologies [42,43].

Patterns and levels of genetic variation in B. anthracis
We identify 37 SNPs among 56 B. anthracis strains. The SNP
location, base-call, and position relative to the respective
GenBank reference sequences [6-8] are contained in Additional data file 3. Twenty-four of the 37 SNPs, including two
singletons, were independently confirmed in identical strains
where whole-genome random shotgun sequence was available (A0039, A4088 and A0442 in Additional data file 1 (J
Ravel, et al., unpublished work)). Of the remaining 13 SNPs
not independently verified by The Institute of Genomic
Research (TIGR), 11 were seen only once in our collection of
strains and two SNPs were seen three times.
Population genetic inference typically assumes that study
samples are selected without prior knowledge of their patterns of genetic variation. For this study, we selected diverse
strains from widely distant geographic regions in an attempt
to sample the full extent of genetic variation in B. anthracis.
The number of SNPs identified, the amount of sequence generated and the nucleotide diversity [44] of the 56 strains is
contained in Table 2. We performed analyses for sequences
comprising the total dataset, for each genomic region separately, and for the total dataset with each resequenced base
assigned into an annotated SNP class. We report three main

http://genomebiology.com/2004/6/1/R10

findings. First, the total average level of DNA sequence variation in B. anthracis is very low. This finding is in agreement
with previous studies [11,28]. This level of genetic variation is
much lower than that seen in commonly studied bacterial
species [14], roughly half of that observed in the human
genome and 25-fold lower than that observed in D. melanogaster [38,39,45-48]. Second, the B. anthracis chromosome appears less variable than either the pXO1 or pXO2
plasmids, although this difference is not statistically significant. Third, the patterns of genetic variation by SNP class (see
Table 2 and Additional data file 4) are similar to that seen in
other well studied bacterial [14] and eukaryotic genomes [45].
Silent sites, those sites that when mutated do not alter the
protein primary structure, are significantly more variable
than are amino acid altering replacement sites (P = 0.0011).
Intergenic regions are observed to have intermediate levels of
genetic variation, whereas replacement sites, those sites that
when mutated alter the protein primary structure, are the
least variable. Replacement sites are marginally significantly
less variable than intergenic sites (P = 0.039) whereas silent
sites are not significantly more variable than intergenic sites
(P = 0.22).
The neutral theory of molecular evolution predicts a characteristic frequency spectrum of SNPs, or segregating sites, for
populations at equilibrium [49]. Deviations from this
expected distribution are observed when an experimental
population sample contains an excess of low frequency, rare
SNPs, or an excess of high frequency, common SNPs, relative
to the neutral expectation. These deviations can arise as a
consequence of demographic history and/or the action of natural selection [50]. Figure 2 compares the observed and
expected percent of SNPs in four allele-frequency classes. The
data suggest an observed excess of rare SNPs as compared to
that expected under the neutral theory. For example, while
the neutral theory predicts that approximately 60% of SNPs
should have minor allele frequencies less than or equal to
0.25, we observe that more that 92% of the B. anthracis SNPs
we discovered have minor allele frequencies that fall into this
class, a statistically significant difference (Figure 2).
We used the Tajima's D statistic [50] to further assess this
pattern for the entire dataset, for SNPs from each genomic
region and for each SNP class (Table 2). Tajima's D is a summary statistic for the site (or SNP) frequency spectrum, whose
value is negative when there is an excess of rare variants and
positive when there is an excess of common variants, relative
to the neutral expectation. The test statistic is calculated from
two different estimates of levels of genetic variation, the
number of segregating sites [44] and the average number of
nucleotide differences estimated from pairwise comparisons
[50]. We observe that Tajima's D is negative for SNPs comprising the total dataset, each genomic region and each SNP
class. While none of the individual test statistics is statistically
significant, they collectively suggest an excess of rare variants
in B. anthracis. If we scale our variation estimates drawn

from the 0.5% resequenced in 56 B. anthracis genomes, we
can estimate a range around the total number of SNPs that
one would detect upon sequencing two random B. anthracis
isolates, sampled in the same fashion as isolates in this study
were chosen. Our results indicate that we should expect to
find, on average, between 944 (standard deviation (SD) 454)
[50] and 1,586 SNPs (SD 762) [44]. A substantial proportion
of these SNPs, probably more than expected under the neutral theory, would be rare.

Using multiple sequence alignments of 17 genes from B.
anthracis (NC_003997, Ames) and B. cereus (NC_004722,
ATCC 14579 [9] and NC_003909, ATCC 10987 [10]) the patterns of genetic polymorphism and divergence at silent and
replacement sites was assessed. The raw counts are presented
in Table 3. It is striking that two B. cereus strains exhibit more
polymorphism at silent and replacement sites than divergence from B. anthracis. This result confirms, at the DNA
sequence level, previous results suggesting that the B. cereus
species group is diverse and polyphyletic in origin. B. anthracis then appears to be a clonal lineage derived from, and
nested within, a diverse species. In other words, the species
names do not encompass or reflect the evolutionary history of
the species [10,51,52].

No evidence for recombination in B. anthracis
chromosome
The 37 SNPs discovered on the B. anthracis chromosome and
plasmids pXO1 and pXO2, possess in total, 636 pairs of sites
where two alleles are observed. In principle, the alleles at each
pair of sites could form four distinct haplotypes. Plasmid
transfer between different B. anthracis strains would affect
physically unlinked site pairs resulting in four distinct haplotypes. Homologous recombination or gene conversion
between physically linked site pairs is also expected to produce all four haplotypes. The straightforward counting of the
number of haplotypes that one detects in a large population
sample, such as the one used in this study, is often referred to
as the four-gamete test [53].
Among the 636 site pairs in our sample, we observe 26 pairs
of sites with two haplotypes, 610 pairs of sites with three
haplotypes, and no pairs of sites with four haplotypes. This
striking result implies that the value of D', the standardized
measure of linkage disequilibrium (LD) [54], is equal to 1, its
maximum value, for all site pairs that we observe. Among the
137 site pairs where we could have detected statistically significant LD at P < 10-3, we observe that 52 site pairs exhibit
statistically significant LD. Four of the six site pairs showing
significant LD on the B. anthracis main chromosome are over
500 kb apart.

Correlation of RA resequencing data with MLVA
typing
Because of the low level of genetic variation in B. anthracis
([28,29] and this study), determining the phylogenetic relationship among B. anthracis strains has proven difficult.
Twenty-four B. anthracis strains characterized with a single
fluorescent AFLP primer combination were reported to be
monomorphic [27]. One recent MLST study sequenced seven
housekeeping genes (approximately 3 kb total) in 5 B.
anthracis strains and reported that the strains were monomorphic at the sites examined. Another recent MLST study
sequenced seven genes (approximately 3 kb total) in 11
diverse B. anthracis strains finding three polymorphic nucleotides [55]. Neither the AFLP nor the MLST studies discover
and genotype sufficient genetic variation to distinguish
between B. anthracis strains.
The most successful marker-based approach used to date,
MLVA, determined the genotypes at eight VNTR loci in 426 B.
anthracis isolates, enabling the construction of a phylogenetic tree of B. anthracis strains [29]. We sought to determine
if our resequencing of 0.5% of each of 56 B. anthracis
genomes is capable of confirming the major phylogenetic
groupings determined by MLVA. To test this, we concatenated the 37 variant positions for all strains in this study, calculated a distance matrix using a simple Kimura substitution
model, and generated an Unweighted Pair Group Method
Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA) tree (see methods [56]; Figure 3).
The strains group together in a manner broadly similar to that

http://genomebiology.com/2004/6/1/R10

found by Keim et al. [29] with B strains forming an outgroup
and most A strains being found together in the same subgroups (Figure 3). There are exceptions: one group in Figure
3 contains a mix of A3a, A1a, A1b and A2 strains. This anomaly is probably due to the relatively few SNPs that effectively
distinguish these groups when only 0.5% of the genome is
sampled. All B. anthracis Ames strains but ASC394 correctly
cluster in an A3b group. B. anthracis ASC394 may be a case
of an originally mistyped or mislabeled strain. Nevertheless,
our data suggest that limited, random resequencing of 0.5%
of the 56 B. anthracis genomes discovers and genotypes
sufficient genetic variation to determine the major phylogenetic relationships among B. anthracis strains.

Discussion

Population genomics requires the random sampling of
genome-wide patterns of DNA sequence variation in a large
number of organisms. Such studies require high-throughput,
highly accurate, cost-effective resequencing technologies.
While the conventional industrial-scale shotgun-sequencing
model is clearly the best technology available for de novo generation of genomic sequence, it may not be the best approach
for resequencing large numbers of strains. RAs, as originally
applied for human genome resequencing [32], offer one competing technology that can rapidly produce very high-quality
data with limited personnel and infrastructure requirements.
Our application of RAs to resequence multiple genomic
regions in the biowarfare pathogen, Bacillus anthracis, further supports this perspective.
Studies of DNA sequence variation are most informative
when both rare and common variants are identified. While
the limited ascertainment of selected common variants can be
employed to identify broad evolutionary relationships among
bacterial genomes, and in fact underlies most bacterial strain
typing methodologies, the ultimate forensic application of
resequencing lies in the ascertainment of rare, presumably
newly arising variants, that may allow more precise determination of a strain's origin. Rare variants may be particularly
informative since they are likely to be restricted to specific
strains (substrains/isolates). Strain genotyping of common
variants provides an incomplete description of genomic patterns of DNA sequence variation, while obtaining most or all
of the genomic sequence from multiple strains allows a
maximally informative analyses of DNA sequence variation,
its function, and ultimately, the evolutionary history of the
organisms. The ability to rapidly, accurately and inexpensively resequence entire bacterial genomes should also contribute to an understanding of a variety of important
phenotypic traits in B. anthracis and other bacterial pathogens [57-62].
Our study demonstrates that microarray-based resequencing
is technologically robust and generates highly replicable and
accurate data when compared to alternative sequence tech-

is to increase overall call rates while not compromising data
quality. Modifications of RA synthesis, experimental protocols and the ABACUS software algorithm could all contribute
to improved base-calling rates. While it is possible to increase
call rates while sacrificing data quality, there is a need to focus
on generating very high-quality data at virtually all sites. If
this is absent, the second-best outcome is to call all bases in
an environment in which we understand the nature of
probable errors. In diverse fields where RAs might be widely
used as a first-stage screening tool, such as BW agent identification or human clinical testing, the imperative is to use
highly sensitive technologies that minimize the false-negative
rate. False-positive findings could be confirmed later in a second-stage screen with an alternative technology such as conventional dideoxy chain termination sequencing.
Microarray-based resequencing identifies and genotypes
SNPs in a single experiment. No prior knowledge of the variability of a site is required - only a reference genomic
sequence. Microarray design and applications are flexible. It
is, however, important to note that the use of RAs in this study
is not as a SNP typing technology. Thus, problems in interpreting the inferred phylogenetic relationships between
strains that arise from SNP typing schema are avoided [63].
RA-based resequencing resembles MLST methodology used
for bacterial strains [52,55,64]. MLST attempts to choose the
most informative genomic regions to resequence, largely
because of the costs associated and technological limitations
in generating enough DNA sequence data on a large collection
of variant strains. While a typical MLST approach might resequence between 3 and 4 kb, in organisms like B. anthracis
that have low levels of genetic variation ([28,51,55] and this
study), this amount of generated sequence is insufficient.
Clearly, RAs, such as those used in this study that can
resequence approximately 29 kb, could rapidly increase this
amount and be used for MLST studies. Furthermore, manufacturing improvements that reduce RA feature sizes enable
the resequencing of greater quantities of genomic sequence
per microarray. Ongoing work at NMRC/BDRD is evaluating
RAs that can resequence 300 kb per chip. At that RA feature
density, when combined with whole-genome amplification
protocols, a single technician in two days could resequence
the entire B. anthracis genome on approximately 15 RAs.
Our data provides the first population genetic estimation of
the levels and patterns of DNA sequence variation in B.
anthracis. We report three main findings. First, among B.
anthracis isolates sampled in the same fashion as in this
study we would expect two randomly selected B. anthracis
strains to differ, on average, at between 944 (SD 454) and
1,586 SNPs (SD 762). The variance surrounding these expectations is large, and any two isolates may differ from the
expectation. Closely related, nonrandomly sampled isolates,
such as those sequenced in [11], will have far fewer SNPs than
that expected for samples drawn from a worldwide collection.
Nevertheless, our data suggest that were it possible to rapidly

http://genomebiology.com/2004/6/1/R10

resequence entire B. anthracis genomes, sufficient genetic
variation is likely to be found to make very fine-level discrimination of strain collections. Resequencing offers the best
chance to identify newly arising, rare, strain-specific variants
that will discriminate between very closely related strains,
since we expect identical genotypes at the known common
genetic variants [11]. We also observe, that as seen in eukaryotic genomes [45], the amount of silent variation per site
within genes is much higher than that seen at replacement
sites. Intergenic regions are seen to have intermediate levels
of polymorphism. This pattern is expected to arise if noncoding intergenic regions possess variants visible to natural
selection. If SNPs in intergenic regions were purely neutral,
then we would expect to see levels of polymorphism similar to
that at silent sites, which are undoubtedly under less stringent selective forces.
Second, the neutral theory of molecular evolution predicts
that in a population at equilibrium, a significant proportion of
the observed genetic variation will consist of rare genetic variants [49]. We observe a significant excess of rare SNPs as
compared to that expected under the neutral theory (Table 2).
This pattern of variation classically has at least two possible
causes. The first consists of a recent population expansion
from a small founder population. The second consists of the
action of natural selection on genetic variants [65-67]. Resequencing technologies will be of particular use in populations
of organisms exhibiting this pattern of genetic variation.
Finally, we see no evidence for plasmid exchange or recombination altering the patterns of DNA sequence variation
among B. anthracis strains in the regions that we resequenced. Some of the regions that we resequenced contain
genes whose function influences B. anthracis pathogenicity
or surrounded the bacterial origin of replication. In other bacterial species, these types of regions are the most likely to
exhibit recombination [14]. The fact that we observe no evidence of plasmid exchange or recombination among physically linked markers in the regions that we resequenced, is
striking.
The simplest interpretation of this observation is that the B.
anthracis strains that we examined are ultimately derived
from a single clonal ancestor and that the exchange of plasmids and recombination between strains during the course of
their evolution is either very rare or nonexistent. While models of natural selection could also account for the patterns that
we see, we think a simple demographic model of recent, rapid
clonal expansion is parsimonious and best supported by our
data. Hence, our findings suggest that B. anthracis populations consist of multiple closely related clones whose life histories
prevent
the
opportunity
for
homologous
recombination between different strains. We note, however,
that while we resequenced 0.5% of the B. anthracis genome,
including regions where we expected to detect recombination, further data collection from multiple genomic regions,

Unique genomic sequences were identified using Miropeats
[68] at the default thresholds from among the B. anthracis
Ames chromosome (5.2 megabase-pair (Mb), NC_003997)
and plasmids pXO1 (181.6 kb, NC_001496) and pXO2 (96.2
kb, NC_002146). The genomic regions that we resequenced
included at least one gene of interest (pXO1: toxin lethal factor precursor lef, toxin moiety, protective antigen pagA;
pXO2: encapsulation protein gene CapC; Ames chromosome:
vrrA, DNA-directed RNA polymerase rpoB, yfhp protein),
but also included many surrounding loci (see Additional data

6,191 bp from pXO1, 6,725 bp from pXO2, and 16,584 bp from
the Ames chromosome (total submitted sequence 29,500 bp).
From these unique sequences, a single 20 × 25 µm RA design
capable of resequencing 29,212 bp or 0.5% of the B. anthracis

Five milliliters of brain heart infusion (BHI) was inoculated

eluted according to the Qiagen protocol. After the DNA was
eluted, it was passed through a 0.22 mm filter. Sterility was
confirmed by plating 10% DNA preparation directly on SBA

The plate and the broth were allowed to incubate for 7 days.
Two hundred milliliters of the broth culture was subcultured

Microarray-based resequencing can rapidly generate very
high quality data, enabling population genomics studies in
bacteria. We find no evidence for plasmid exchange or recombination altering the patterns of DNA sequence variation
among B. anthracis strains in the regions that we resequenced The patterns of genetic variation in the B. anthracis
regions resequenced are consistent with that expected for a
bacterial species that has undergone a rapid, historically
recent expansion from a single clone. Detecting plasmid
exchange or recombination between B. anthracis genetic variants could act as an indicator of a newly emerging or genetically engineered strain.

We selected a geographically diverse panel of 56 B. anthracis
strains from the Biological Defense Research Directorate collection (see Additional data file 1). Twenty-four of the strains
originated from the Louisiana State University collection
[29]. These have been typed by MLVA [29] and in order to
sample diversity, we chose a group that had representatives of
the A1a, A1b, A2, A3a, A3b, A3d, A4, B1 and B2 lineages. The
remaining 35 strains originate from a UK collection and were
chosen to represent geographical variation as well as unusual
phenotypes such as gamma phage and penicillin resistance.
Six of the UK strains were reisolates of the Ames strain [11],
which allowed us to test the reproducibility of resequencing.

Conclusions

B. anthracis strains surveyed

reports

Taken together, the findings of a low number of differences
between strains, a preponderance of rare variants, and an
absence of recombination all point to a scenario where the
current world population of B. anthracis has expanded
recently from a single clone derived from, and nested within
a diverse species, B. cereus. Other bacterial pathogens, such
as the potential biowarfare agent Yersinia pestis, possess a
similar recent pattern of rapid expansion [15]. However, the
patterns of genetic variation in Y. pestis are quite different
from that seen in B. anthracis, for instance in the much more
active role of insertion sequences in Yersinia. We speculate
that the B. anthracis history of clonal expansion could arise
as a consequence of the life history of a highly pathogenic
sporulating mammalian pathogen. Exploring the population
biology of less virulent members of the B. cereus group could
directly test this. These population genomics studies could
determine if clonal clusters of B. cereus strains exhibit similar
population dynamics and patterns of genetic variation, or
whether the picture of B. anthracis emerging from studies
such as this is as unusual as the level of pathogenicity of the
species itself.

Materials and methods

reviews

The absence of recombination in B. anthracis, a potential biowarfare agent, suggests a novel approach to identifying a
newly arising or a genetically engineered strain. A recombination event could arise through rare natural genetic exchange
or as a consequence of genetic engineering. Irrespective of the
cause, the discovery of a B. anthracis strain possessing evidence of genetic recombination would warrant close examination and probably demand immediate further phenotypic
and genomic characterization.

or the entire genome, would allow a more thorough analysis
of this pattern. Sequencing a larger percentage of the genome
in a similar-sized or larger sample of isolates would provide
greater power to detect rare recombination events. We are
undertaking such a project to test the validity of our inference
and to better determine if recombination is rare or absent
among B. anthracis strains.

purines or the most guanines. The number of times that a
given base was called was tabulated across all 115 successful
RAs. The mean purine and guanine composition was determined for the classes that were called in all 115 RAs and
uncalled in all 115 RAs. A Student's t test with unequal variances was used to test for difference in mean sequence composition (purines/guanines) between the always called and

Long PCR product concentration was determined by using
Pico-Green (Molecular Probes, Inc.) with lambda DNA standards (Invitrogen). The LPCR products were then pooled,
DNAse digested, biotin endlabelled and hybridized to individual RAs overnight following established protocols contained
in [32]. Subsequent washes and stains were carried out as
described in Cutler et al. [32] and were only washed and not
antibody stained. RAs were scanned at 570 nm, with a pixel
size of 3 µm/pixel averaged over two scans. Automated grid
alignment and base calling was performed for the .DAT files
on a Mac G5 computer with the ABACUS software suite.

All population genetic analyses were calculated using the
popgen_fasta2.0.c code (Cutler DJ, unpublished work) on
the collection of 56 sets of B. anthracis fasta files. The fasta
files were analyzed in total and separately for the main chromosome and plasmids pXO1 and pXO2. The identification of
genes was taken from publicly available annotation contained
in the relevant GenBank refseq files (B. anthracis str. Ames
NC_003997; pXO1, NC_001496; pXO2 NC_002146). The
statistical significance of linkage disequilibrium between site
pairs was performed by using the Fisher's Exact Test at P < 10-3
[69].

Estimating levels of genetic variation
To account for missing data, θ is estimated by [Σn(Sn/an)]/L,
where Sn is the number of observed segregating sites at positions with exactly n alleles sequenced (n is a maximum of 56,
fewer with missing data), an = Σi = 1..n-1 1/i, and L is the total
length of the sequence examined. Var{θ} is estimated by [Σn
(Lnθ/an + (Ln)2bnθ2/(an)2]/L2, where Ln is the number of sites
with data from exactly n alleles, and bn = Σi = 1..n-1 1/i2. With
missing data π is estimated by [Σi 2piqini/(ni - 1)]/L, where the
sum is taken over all sites i, pi and qi are the allele frequencies
at site i, and ni is the number of alleles sequenced at site i.

RA sequence determination
An ABACUS parameter search was employed to determine
those parameters that called the maximal number of bases
while minimizing discrepancies [32]. This total experiment
consisted of 118 RAs, of which three failed (< 60% base calling). Of the remaining 115 RAs, 8 were used to sequence individual strains once. Of the remaining 107 RAs, 96 were used
to replicate hybridize 48 B. anthracis strains, while the
remaining 11 RAs were used as additional multiple replicates
of these same strains. In total, sequence data was generated
from 56 unique B. anthracis strains (see Additional data file 1
for strain listing). In order to obtain the most complete data
possible, for those strains with replicate RA sequences, a single composite strain sequence was generated for subsequent

To determine if the estimates of theta between SNP types
(silent, replacement, intergenic) are significantly different,
we used the number of samples sequenced, the number of
segregating sites, and the length of the region to find a maximum-likelihood estimate of theta per site for each SNP type
using equations 11 and 12 in Hudson [70]. We compared all
possible SNP types against each other (silent vs replacement,
silent vs intergenic, replacement vs. intergenic). For a given
pair of SNP types, we first determined the maximum-likelihood estimator of theta for each type individually. We then
determined the maximum-likelihood estimator of theta,
assuming both types had identical theta per site. We ask
whether the model with different thetas for each type fits

As a second method, we employed Tajima's D statistic [50],
estimated as (π - θ)/Var(π - θ). Under the neutral model, π
and θ have the same expectation, hence Tajima's D is
expected to be 0. Since π is a function of site heterozygosities
and θ is a function of the total number of segregating sites,
Tajima's D is negative (positive) with an excess (deficit) of
rare sites. We use our estimated values of π [51] and θ [45],

detect unusual patterns of genetic diversity. We employed
two different approaches for this analysis. First, we calculated

ΣnθLn [1/i + 1/(n - i)] and from this determine the expected
percent of sites under the neutral expectation. This is directly
compared with the observed percent of SNPs in Figure 2.
