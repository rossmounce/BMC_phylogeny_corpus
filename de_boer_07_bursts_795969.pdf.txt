Abstract
Background: Several genome duplications have occurred in the evolutionary history of teleost
fish. In returning to a stable diploid state, the polyploid genome reorganized, and large portions are
lost, while the fish lines evolved to numerous species. Large scale transposon movement has been
postulated to play an important role in the genome reorganization process. We analyzed the DNA
sequence of several large loci in Salmo salar and other species for the presence of DNA transposon
families.
Results: We have identified bursts of activity of 14 families of DNA transposons (12 Tc1-like and
2 piggyBac-like families, including 11 novel ones) in genome sequences of Salmo salar. Several of
these families have similar sequences in a number of closely and distantly related fish, lamprey, and
frog species as well as in the parasite Schistosoma japonicum. Analysis of sequence similarities
between copies within the families of these bursts demonstrates several waves of transposition
activities coinciding with salmonid species divergence. Tc1-like families show a master gene-like
copying process, illustrated by extensive but short burst of copying activity, while the piggyBac-like
families show a more random copying pattern. Recent families may include copies with an open
reading frame for an active transposase enzyme.
Conclusion: We have identified defined bursts of transposon activity that make use of masterslave and random mechanisms. The bursts occur well after hypothesized polyploidy events and
coincide with speciation events. Parasite-mediated lateral transfer of transposons are implicated.

Background
Two genome duplications are thought to have occurred in
the evolutionary history of ancient vertebrates, a third in
ancestral teleosts, with a fourth occurring more recently in
the genome of salmonid fishes (Salmonidae), 25 to 100
million years ago (Mya) [1,2]. After duplication and subsequent mutation of the duplicated chromosomes, the
polyploid genome began to reduce to a more stable dip-

loid form, losing approximately 50 percent of its DNA [3].
In this model, rediploidization preceeded and is concurrent with speciation events of the Salmonidae line to Salmoninae (salmon and trout), Coregoninae (whitefish), and
Thymallinae (grayling). Subsequently, Salmoninae radiated
into at least seven genera, including Salmo (Atlantic
salmon and trout), Oncorhynchus (Pacific salmon and
trout), and Salvelinus (char and brook trout), comprising

of approximately 30 species [4-6]. The mechanism by
which this restabilization occurs is not well understood,
but large scale movement of repetitive sequences, in particular transposable elements, are postulated to play a
major role in reshaping genomes and the genome's evolution. These sequences, which make up a large fraction of
the genomes of plants and animals, can move about in the
genome by making copies of themselves or by excision
and reintegration. Significant increases in transposon
activity have indeed been noted in plants after allopolyploidization [7], during chromosome rearrangements in
Drosophila [8], and after species hybridization [9].
One type of these transposable elements, the DNA transposon, is completely excised from the genome and reintegrates in a different place. DNA transposons contain a
single open reading frame that codes for a transposase
enzyme. This enzyme facilitates the excision and reinsertion of the transposon element. In addition to moving
through the genome of the host cell, transposons also
appear to be able to move between species, in a process
called horizontal or lateral transfer [10,11]. When an
organism acquires a new active transposon, a burst of
transposition activity may ensue until all copies are mutationally inactivated. Movement of large numbers of transposons through the genome can have profound
consequences [12] as they may jump into genes or into
controlling sequences and effectively become a mutagen,
both in vivo [13] and in vitro [14].
Recombination between mobile elements may result in
deletions, translocations, or the formation of dicentric
chromosomes [15]. Such mobile elements, therefore,
have helped shape genomes throughout evolutionary history. The mining of genomes for these elements and their
subsequent phylogenetic analysis of members of same or
different classes may shed light on these events. In this
study we have recovered and identified the sequence features of approximately 250 members of 14 DNA transposon families in the salmonid Salmo salar. A number of
these are also found in Oncorhynchus mykiss and in several
other closely and distantly related fish species, in frogs, as
well as in the parasite Schistosoma japonicum.

Results
DNA transposon families
To explore the role of transposons in speciation events in
fish, nearly 3 Mbp of BAC sequence from Salmo salar as
well as from Oncorhynchus mykiss was analyzed for the
presence of DNA transposon-like sequences. In addition,
a number of published clones from Xenopus and several
other fish species were included in the analysis. We recovered over 250 fragments of transposon members from 14
different DNA transposon families (named DTSsa1 to
pTSsa2) in the genome of S. salar, including a few possibly

complete copies. Sequences are found in Additional Files
1 and 2. A total of 237 sequences were aligned in two separate groups, Tc1-like sequences (162 sequences), and
piggyBac-like sequences (75 sequences). The sequences
used are at least 1000 base pairs long, except for EST fragments from S. japonicum, which are 500 to 700 base pairs
long. Phylogenetic trees were constructed separately for
each of the two groups (fig 1). The sequence alignments
are found in Additional Files 3 and 4. The DNA sequences
of the families within each group are at least 20% different. In many instances, the recovered copies of transposons have internal deletions and insertions and
frequently only fragments of an element were found.
Twelve families (figure 1A) belong to the Tc1/mariner
class of transposons. This class is modeled on the Tc1
transposon in C. elegans, and members in this class are
approximately 1,500 base pairs long, contain a single
open reading frame encoding a transposase enzyme and
end in two Inverted Terminal Repeats (ITR). The target
specificity of Tc1 class elements dictates insertion at a
genomic 5'-TA-3' dinucleotide sequence. The Tc1-like
transposons we identified can be grouped into two subclasses (table 1). One subclass consists of sequences with
long ITRs (~200 bp) and CAGT at the end of their inverted
repeats (DTSsa family 1, 4, 9, 10 and SSTN1, Tss, and
SALT1) while the other subclass has short ITRs (~20 bp)
and variations of the CAGT sequence at their ends (DTSsa
family 2, 5, 6, and 7). This dichotomy has been observed
before [16,17]. Transposons SSTN1 [Genbank:AJ249090]
[11], Tss [Genbank:L12207] [18], and SALT1 [Genbank:L22865] [19] have been described previously. There
is insufficient sequence information for transposon
DTSsa3 and DTSsa6 to determine the structure of the
inverted terminal repeat sequences, although it is short for
DTSsa6. However, there is partial sequence data for both
that provides amino acid sequence motifs and confirms
their nature as a DNA transposon. The DTSsa5 family has
two copies that are highly similar (figure 1A) (< 0.1 percent difference) as a 15 kbp region in the TCR alpha locus
in salmon, that contains one of the DTSsa5 copies,
appears to have been recently duplicated.
The conservation of the left and right ITR of a transposon
is not always easily identified. For example, while DTSSa1
has very conserved left and right ITRs, SSTN1 and SALT1
have much less conserved ITRs. However, the long ITRs
have a direct repeated sequence located at their outer and
inner ends [16], representing binding sites for the transposase enzyme. This makes it possible to identify the
entire ITR through these direct repeats. For example,
SSTN1 appears to have an 80 base pair ITR (judged by a
dotter plot) and was reported as such [11], but this can be
extended to 206 base pair when judged by the presence of
the direct repeats (figure 2).

Sequence alignments were performed with ClustalW and phylogenetic trees generated with MEGA3.1 using the Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA), pairwise deletion, and a pdistance model. Sequences used in the tree are at least 1000 bp, but EST sequences from Schistosoma japonicum are between
500 and 700 bp long. DTSsa3 is not included in the tree as only fragments of a few hundred base pairs were recovered that
conform to the amino acid motifs required for a Tc1-like transposon. DTSsa5 has two copies that are closely related due to a
recent duplication event. Shown below are the color markers for the species. No marker in the tree indicates Salmo salar. All

We identified two non-Tc1-like transposon families
(pTSsa1 and pTSsa2; Table 1 and Fig 1B). Sequence characteristics suggest that they consist of piggyBac-like transposons, based on their genomic insertion specificity (5'TTAA-3') and the very ends of the approximately 18 base
pair ITR sequence (5'-CCT-3'; consistent with the 5'-CCY3' of reported sequences) [20,21]. In addition, the left and
right inverted terminal repeats of pTSsa1 and 14 have a
consistent several nucleotide difference, which agrees
with previous findings for piggyBac ITR sequences [22].
These two families contain a 380 base pair sequence
which is known as the NheI repeat [GENBANK:L25409]
[23]. Even though many very similar copies are present in
salmon, the sequence itself does not appear to contain any
significant open reading frames or recognizable amino
acid motifs. A single copy, similar to these sequences, was

also found in Oncorhynchus mykiss (in the IgH.A locus
[GENBANK:AY872256]) (figure 1B). Interestingly,
whereas the pTSsa1 and 14 families are only approximately 80 percent similar, the first 200 base pairs of these
sequences share a higher degree of similarity (approximately 94 percent), possibly indicating a functionally
conserved role for this region. The pTSsa1 and 14
sequences have been very active as seen in the high degree
of similarity between many members. In particular,
pTSsa2 has many nearly identical copies (< 0.1 percent
different). In several instances copies have been found
inside one another. In one example, a copy inserted itself
into a TTAA sequence of a sequence containing the S. salar
MHC class 1b locus, a second copy inserted itself at a
TTAA sequence inside the first copy, and a third copy
inserted itself into the second copy. Interestingly, the third

copy belongs in a phylogenetic branch comprised of multiple nearly identical copies (pTSsa2), consistent with the
most recent insertion event. In several other instances, a
copy has been found inside another copy (e.g. in the
salmon MHC class 1b locus), inserted into a DTSsa11
transposon in the salmon TCRÎ± locus, and two copies
were found perfectly adjacent in the salmon TCRÎ± locus,
with a shared 5'-TTAA-3' sequence between them.
Transposon sequences are transcribed
DNA transposons have a single open reading frame, coding for a transposase enzyme. Active transposons would
result in messenger transcripts of the gene. Krasnov et al.
[24] suggested from expression microarray data that transposase genes were probably transcribed from their own
promoters and that expression increased with environmental stress. We searched our salmon EST database
[25,26] for the presence of transcripts that contain DTSsa
transposon sequences. Perhaps surprisingly, representatives all of the DTSsa transposon families are represented
in the EST transcripts. One representative sequence of

each transposon was used in the search, resulting in many
EST hits. We found a similar variation in the recovered
EST sequences for a DTSsa family as we find in the
genomic sequence within each DTSsa family, indicating
that many different members of each family are present
among the transcripts (data not shown). However, many
of the transposon families (e.g. DTSsa1, DTSsa2, Tss,
SALT1, and pTSsa1 and pTSsa2) were found as complete
copies (i.e. including their ITRs) internal to transcripts
present in the salmon EST database. While transcription
from internal transposon promoters cannot be excluded,
these transcripts, therefore, are initiated from a sequence
adjacent to the transposon, and not from an internal
transposon promoter. This indicates that the transposons
have inserted themselves into actively transcribed genes.
Similar DNA transposons in other species
Using the DNA transposons found in salmon as query
sequences for Genbank BLAST searches, we have recovered similar sequences from numerous different fish and
frog species (table 2). Interestingly, many of the sequences

recovered from different species can be aligned with the
salmon Tc1-like sequences and placed in the phylogenetic
tree in such a way as being indistinguishable from those
recovered from S. salar (figure 1). This includes sequences
from such diverse species as pike, Polypterus, and the frogs
Rana pipens, Xenopus laevis and Xenopus tropicalis.
Most of the transposon families, with the exception of
DTSsa9 and 10, and pTSsa1 and 2, were also identified in
Genbank EST collections of Schistosoma japonicum (listed
in Methods). These sequences, found in S. japonicum by
Liu et al. [27], are very similar to those found in various
fish species, and, when compared to similar sequence
fragments, are placed close with members of different species. While no sequence similar to DTSsa10 has been
found in S. japonicum, a 490 base pair common sequence
fragment of DTSsa10 from salmon is also found in the
frogs Rana pipens, Xenopus laevis and Xenopus tropicalis with
at least 88 percent similarity.

Bursts of DNA transposon activity
Bursts of DNA transposon activity. Horizontal bars represent the duration of bursts of Tc1-like DNA transposon in
Salmo salar, based on earliest and latest branching. The
shaded areas indicate the approximate timing of the genome
duplication event (left) and further speciation events [4]
(right).

Discussion
Transposable elements have been implicated in genomic
reorganizations. Our study investigates the possible connection between DNA transposition and the speciation
process. To this end we have identified numerous members of many novel DNA transposons families in the salmonid Salmo salar as well as several in a number of related
species. Of fourteen identified transposon families, eleven
are novel. The remaining three are the previously
described DNA transposons SALT1, Tss, and SSTN1. An
analysis of the sequences revealed some interesting features and relationships. Phylogenetic grouping after alignment of the DTSsa and pTSsa transposon sequences based
on complete or nearly complete DNA sequence [28] is
shown in figures 1A and 1B. We have named the families
based on branching at around 80â85 percent similarity.
This approximately coincides with the proposed timing of
the last genome duplication event [1,29,30]. The 14 transposon families include twelve Tc1-like families and two
piggyBac-like families; approximately 250 copies and
fragments of sequences from Salmo salar and Oncorhynchus mykiss and several other species. Members of the Tc1like families have become active at different times in the
past and then display a short period of intense copying
activity (figure 1 and 3). The copying pattern seen for piggyBac-like transposons, however, exhibits a different,
more random mechanism.
Mode of transposition
The number of transposons in the genome increases in a
manner depending on their copying mechanism. A retrotransposon is transcribed as RNA and subsequently
reverse transcribed and integrated, creating a copy of itself.
DNA transposons, on the other hand, excise themselves
using their encoded transposase, and the element then

reintegrates elsewhere in the genome. This results in
movement of the transposon, rather than producing a
copy. Mechanisms for increased copy number have been
suggested, for example, the copy number can increase during S-phase if reinsertion occurs ahead of a replication
fork.. Two models have been suggested to account for the
appearance of a phylogenetic tree of copies of transposon
sequences [31,32], a master gene model, in which one or
several active sequences spawn inactive copies of themselves, and a random template model where many copies
produce offspring which may subsequently become active
themselves. Our data provide examples of both of these
outcomes. The expansion patterns of the Tc1-like transposon families appear to follow a typical master-like copying
mechanism. Most of the Tc1-like families in salmon
"explode" in bursts of copying activity at different points
in the past, but later seem to become quiescent (Fig. 1).
Each burst of activity results in a sequential replacement
pattern. On the other hand, the two piggyBac-like transposon families appear to follow a more random evolution
pattern. This difference in propagation pattern points to a
difference in transposition mechanism. Our finding of
several families where the entire transposon sequence,
including their ITRs, is present inside expressed EST
sequences suggests a way of replication through retrotranscription, resulting in a "master gene" appearance of
the phylogenetic tree of Tc1-like families. However, as this
mechanism would not require an active DNA transposon,
the cessation of the burst would depend on the transcription of the "host gene" becoming inactivated, something
we do not observe. As well, the pTSsa1 and pTSsa2 families are also found as complete copies internal to EST transcripts, and these families do not display a typical "master
gene" appearance. Whereas the Tc1-like families have cod-

ing potential for a transposase enzyme, there is no recognizable coding for any relevant amino acid motif in
pTSsa1 and 2. As the first 200 base pairs of members of
pTSsa1 and pTSsa2 are highly similar, this may suggest a
functional role for these sequences. These elements are
especially concentrated in the S. salar T-cell receptor alpha
variable gene region, where small clusters of them are
interspersed with small clusters of variable genes. Of interest is the very recent expansion of some of these elements
of the pTSsa2 family (divergence < 0.1 %).
Active transposons?
DNA transposons gather mutations over time, resulting in
vertical inactivation [33]. Eventually all that remains are
relics of the original sequence; the majority of DNA transposons in genomes are no more than fragments and
altered sequences. Therefore, most instances are remnants, and only those that have recently been active can be
found as intact or near intact copies. Transposon
sequences that have displayed recent activity will have
copies that are more similar, such as DTSsa1 and DTSsa2.
A few copies of these transposon families have an open
reading frame. One copy of DTSsa1 in salmon and two
copies of DTXtr1 in X. tropicalis share 82% amino acid
similarity over an open reading frame of 340 amino acids.
One member of DTSsa2 has an open reading frame of 319
amino acids, while a copy of DTOmy2 has a single
frameshift interrupting the reading frame. These reading
frames share all the characteristics of Tc1-like transposase
amino acid sequences which are typically between 320 to
343 residues long and contain the typical DD(34)E transposase motif [18]. Other transposon families that have
gathered more mutations display much more sequence
variation and except for stretches with recognizable
amino acid motifs, no corresponding open reading frames
have been found. It is therefore possible that both the
DTSsa1 and DTSsa2 families currently contain active
transposons. Sleeping Beauty has been reconstructed from
a Tc1-like sequence, active > 10 Mya [34]. Since open
reading frames were identified in DTSsa1 and DTSsa2, it
suggests that it is possible to construct useful vectors from
these more recent transposons.
Horizontal invasion
Transposons can spread rapidly through a population.
Elements of DNA transposon P spread through the entire
Drosophila melanogaster population on all continents since
the 1950's [35]. The finding that a nearly identical P element is present in D. willistoni strongly suggested a recent
horizontal transfer between the two species [10]. Mariner
elements have also been seen to transfer between Diptera
and Neuroptera [36]. Leaver [11] reported the occurrence
of SSTN1 in salmon, and similar sequences in flatfish and
Rana temporaria and also suggested horizontal transmission between species. Radice et al [18], on the other hand,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/422

isolated transposon sequences from three teleost species
and found no indication of similarities. Interestingly, we
have identified highly similar sequences from numerous,
rather diverse species. Sequences very similar to the DNA
transposons in Salmo salar are found in various other fish
species, including other teleosts as well as the sea lamprey
Petromyzon marinus and the frogs Xenopus and Rana.
In particular, copies of Tss greater than 90% similar to
those seen in salmonid members were found in eight different species, including the very distant northern pike
Esox lucius which branched away before a genome duplication that led to the teleost line. The DTSsa10 sequence
of S. salar is also found in very diverse species, including
in the primitive bony fish Polypterus bichir, which branches
off before the genome duplication of 400 Mya, and in the
frogs Rana pipens, Xenopus laevis and Xenopus tropicalis,
with more than approximately 88 percent similarity over
a 490 base pair sequence. Confirming initial reports of
fish transposons in the trematode worm parasite Schistosoma japonicum by Melamed et al. [37] and Matveev et al.
[5], we have also found most transposon families in EST
data of this parasite. We identified sequences of all the
transposon families except the Tc1-like DTSsa9 and 10,
and the piggyBac-like pTSsa1 and pTSsa2 in EST data of S.
japonicum. We have included the eight longest sequences
that were found in the parasite data, in six families, in the
data for alignment and the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1). The
finding that most of the salmon transposon sequences are
found in EST data of the parasite strongly suggests that
this organism has provided a general shuttle service for
lateral transposition between different aquatic species.
Currently the related Diplostomum species, not Schistosoma, have fish as part of their life cycle. However, host
switching is a feature of schistosome evolution [38] and a
host-parasite relationship over evolutionary times cannot
be ruled out. Our series of rapid bursts of expansion (fig 1
and 3) is in agreement with numerous horizontal invasions at different times in the past.
Relation between transposition and speciation
A burst of speciation in the salmonid line followed a
duplication of the teleost genome which happened
approximately 25 to 100 Mya [1,2]. This duplication
event is thought to have occurred at 86% similarity
[29,39]. Our transposon naming system originates
around this point. The Salmonidae line then branched into
Salmoninae, Coregoninae, (and Thymallinae) around the
92% similarity point [40]. The subsequent divergence of
the Salmoninae lineage into Salmo, Oncorhynchus, and Salvelinus occurred over a short time [41], and is estimated to
have occurred between 14 to 23 million years ago [4,42].
This separation took place at 94â95% similarity [39]. Subsequent speciation continues to the present time. Bernatchez placed the most recent speciation events,

including those to S. salar and S. trutta, between 0.5 and
2.0 million years ago [43], based on fossil data and mitochondrial DNA divergence.
The difference in sequence between members of a family
of transposons during the bursts is between approximately 1 percent and 14 percent, depending on the family. The burst of transposon SALT1, for example, initiates
in salmon around 9 percent and ends around 6 percent
(Fig. 3). On the other hand, the burst of DTSsa2, the most
recently active transposon in salmon, lasts only from
approximately 1.8 percent to 0.9 percent. Overall, these
ranges of values of the overlapping bursts places these
events after the assumed genome duplication in the salmonid line and well overlapping with later speciation
events. These findings are in agreement with other studies
that link transposon activity with large scale genomic reorganization. Different transposition mobilization patterns
are observed in humans and chimpanzees after their separation from a common ancestor [44], and extensive
transposition during genome stabilization following species hybridization has been documented [16,45].

Conclusion
In conclusion, our data suggests that the timing of the
bursts of transposon replication activity coincides with
the time of radiation of the Salmoninae to Salmo, Oncorhynchus, and Salvelinus and subsequent speciation, as several waves of transposon activities sweep through the
species. Our data supports the hypothesis that laterally
injected massive transposon movement played a role in
chromosomal reorganization at various times during speciation.

ence of sequences that are similar to the DNA transposon
sequences that we found in salmon.
The following DNA sequences and BAC clones were used
in this analysis. The Salmo salar TCRÎ± locus [30], the
major histocompatibility loci MHC class 1a and 1b [29],
the growth hormone and interleukin loci (manuscripts in
preparation), and zoneadhesin-like genes [Genbank:AY785950] and the Oncorhynchus mykiss sequences
for the metallothionein gene [GENBANK:DQ156151],
MHC1a [Genbank:AB162342] and MHC1b loci [Genbank:AB162343], and the IgH.A locus [Genbank:AY872256]. Genbank sequence entries were used in
this study from a variety of other organisms (table 2):
Oncorhynchus mykiss, Ictalurus punctatus, Esox lucius, Cyprinus carpio, Salvelinus namaycush, Salvelinus confluentus, Salvelinus fontinalis, Tanichthys albonus, Carassius auratus,
Astatotilapia burtoni, Oryzias latipes, Petromyzon marinus,
Danio rerio, Xenopus tropicalis, Xenopus laevis, Rana pipens,
and Polypterus bichir. Sequences from Schistosoma japonicum EST Genbank data were found for transposon families as follows: DTSsa1 [Genbank:AY915112, AY809993],
DTSsa2 [Genbank:AY816058, AY834394], DTSsa3 [GenDTSsa4
[Genbank:AY812589,
bank:AY124772],
AY915240], DTSsa5 [Genbank:AY813498], DTSsa6 [GenDTSsa7
[Genbank:AY813225,
bank:AY813020],
AY915121], SSTN1 [Genbank:AY809988, AY815476,
AY915835], Tss [Genbank:AY915400, AY915891], and
SALT1 [Genbank:AY223470, AY915102].
Representative sequences from all new families have been
deposited in GenBank under accession numbers
EF685954 â EF685960, EF685962 â EF685963, and
EF685966 â EF685967.

Methods
The starting point for this in silico analysis were the
sequences for the two known salmon DNA transposons
SALT1 [Genbank:L22865] [19] and Tss [Genbank:L12207] [18], as well as an analysis of the sequence
of the T-cell receptor alpha locus of Salmo salar by RepeatMasker [46]. These two transposons as well as the RepeatMasker data were used to find faint similarities which
were used in turn to find a larger number of each family
in approximately 3 Mbp of sequence. The Dotter program
[47] was used extensively to find regions of similar
sequence, which were extracted and stored in an SQL
database. The length of the transposon sequences was
determined by identifying the inverted terminal repeat
sequences where possible. Sequence alignments were performed with ClustalW [48] and phylogenetic trees generated with MEGA3.1 [49] using the Unweighted Pair
Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA), pairwise
deletion, and a p-distance model. The entire alignment of
the sequences was used in the phylogenetic reconstruction. Our salmon EST database was searched for the pres-
