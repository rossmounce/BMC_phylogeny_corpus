Abstract
Background: Sperm ion channel proteins (CatSpers) are essential for sperm hyperactivated motility, and then
penetration through the zona pellucida. The CatSper class of proteins have well been characterized in the mouse
and human. However, such data for pigs are not available. In the present study, we cloned the porcine CatSper 1-4
genes, analysed their spatial expression in various organs and temporal expression in the testes from birth until
sexual maturity in Meishan boars.
Methods: Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was performed to clone the full length cDNAs of porcine
CatSper genes and bioinformatics analysis of inferred CatSper proteins was also determined. Various organs were
collected from 150 day-old pigs to characterize the spatial expression of CatSper genes by qualitative reverse
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and testes from birth to 150 day-old boars were sampled to
detect the temporal expression of CatSper genes by quantitative real-time RT-PCR.
Results: The mRNA sequences of CatSper1 (2452 bp), CatSper2 (2038 bp), CatSper3 (1408 bp), and CatSper4 (1799
bp), including full length of cDNAs, 5’ and 3’ flanks, were obtained. The bioinformatics analysis indicated that
coding regions spanning the ion transport domains were conserved for different species analyzed. Among the four
CatSpers, CatSper2, 3, and 4 were more conserved across species, compared with CatSper1. In addition, six
conservative trans-membrane domains, a pore forming motif, and a coiled-coil motif were also identified. The
spatial analysis from different organs showed that CatSper1 was detected in both testes and hypothalamus,
CatSper2 was restricted in testes only, CatSper4 was expressed in testes and rete testes; whereas CatSper3 was
more ubiquitously. CatSper3 and CatSper4 transcripts were also detected in ejaculated sperm. At Days 1 and 30 of
age, CatSper mRNAs exhibited only sparse expression in the testes. However, these transcripts highly expressed at
Day 60 and onward till sexual maturity (Day 150 of age).
Conclusions: The spatial and temporal expression profiles of CatSper genes were reported herein for the first time
in pigs. CatSper1, CatSper2 and CatSper4 were primarily expressed in testes, while CatSper3 transcript was
prevalent in a variety of organs. CatSper3 and CatSper4 mRNAs were present in mature sperm cells. Substantial
upregulation of CatSper genes was initiated at Day 60 and maintained this marked production until sexual
maturity.

Background
The CatSper ion channel proteins were first discovered
by Ren et al. [1]. Later it was discovered that this ion
channel is a sophisticated protein complex composed of
at least six subunits, of which four alpha subunits

(CatSper 1-4) form a calcium selective pore [2,3], and
two additional auxiliary subunits, CatSperb and CatSperg, which are transmembrane proteins with large
extracellular domains [4,5]. CatSper1 and CatSper2 were
identified to be essential for sperm motility and male
fertility in the mouse [6-9]. It was also found that CatSper1 is required for the Ca 2+ current activation by
alkalinization during sperm cell capacitation [10];
whereas CatSper3 and CatSper4 are essential for sperm

hyperactivated motility and male fertility [3,11,12]. Studies with CatSper1, 2, 3, and 4 knock-out mice revealed
that all four subunits are required for stable expression
of the heteromeric channel complex, and knockout of
any one of these subunits result in absence of the other
subunits [3,6,12].
In the mouse, the expression of CatSper1-4, CatSperb
and CatSperg is confined to the testes [1,3-5,11,13]. It
was also found that CatSper1, CatSper2, CatSperb and
CatSperg were localized specifically at the principal
piece of mature sperm [1,4,5,13], and CatSper3 and CatSper4 were present in the acrosome of sperm [12]. The
mRNA expression of mouse CatSper is developmentally
timed to coincide with the appearance of round spermatids [14,15]. Furthermore, the relative CatSper gene
expression level is positively correlated with sperm motility in human [14,16].
Porcine represents a classic animal model in biomedical research and an important farm animal in agriculture. However, no data on CatSper genes expression
and sequence is currently available. The onset of spermatogensis in Chinese Meishan boars occurs at much
earlier age compared with western breed of pigs. the
former breed reach puberty at about 75 days, undergo
sexual maturity at around 120 days of age [17], and are
well known for their extremely high prolificacy with litter size of 15 to 16. Thus, Meishan pigs offer a unique
model to characterize factors influencing male reproductive function. As an initial step toward understanding
the function of the CatSper proteins in pigs, the present
study cloned and sequenced CatSper cDNAs and characterized their temporal expression profiles in the testes
during postnatal development, and spatial expression in
diverse non-reproductive and reproductive organs, and
in ejaculated sperm of Chinese Meishan pigs.

Methods
Tissue and sperm sample collection

Animal care and use was approved by the University of
Yangzhou University Animal Care and Use Committee.
To study spatial expression in different organs, fourteen
different organs samples, including brain (frontal lobe),
cerebellum, pituitary, hypothalamus, hippocampus,
heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, colon, small intestine,
longissimus muscle, abdominal fat, and twelve reproductive organs, including testes, rete testes, caput, corpus
and cauda epididymidis, bulbourethral gland, prostate
gland, seminal vesicle, vas deferens, penis from 150-day
old boars, ovary and uterus from 150-day old gilts, and
sperm samples from three adult Meishan boars at different ages were used for evaluation of CatSper genes. To
study temporal expression of CatSper genes during
development, testis samples at post-natal days 1 (n = 5),
30 (n = 4), 60 (n = 3), 90 (n = 3) and 150 (n = 3) of age

were collected. Organ samples were collected immediately after slaughter, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and
stored at -80°C freezer until RNA isolation. Sperm samples were collected and subjected to swim-up in Tyrode’s complete medium (TCM) [18] at a 45° angle, 5%
CO 2 and 37°C for 60 min to remove any potential
somatic cell contamination. Top fraction (1/2) of sperm
samples were separated by centrifugation at 1200 g for 5
minutes at 25°C and washed twice in TCM, and then
used for RNA extraction.
RNA isolation and cDNA Synthesis

Trizol reagent was used to isolate total RNA from the
homogenized organ (about 50 mg/ml Trizol) and sperm
samples (about 5 × 109 cells/ml Trizol) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen). The first strand
cDNA was synthesized by incubating 2 ug of total RNA
with Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus reverse transcriptase (M-MLV, Promega, USA) at 42°C for 50 min.
Molecular cloning of porcine CatSper cDNAs

The full-length cDNA sequences of porcine CatSper
genes were obtained by using rapid amplification of
cDNA ends (RACE) method. Initially, primers of CatSpers (CatSper1, forward:5’ggttgtgggaaaaattaagc3’,
reverse:5’ggtagatgagggaccagtcg3’; CatSper2, forward:
5’gatactttctctctcatcgagc3’, reverse:5’cattccaggcattcttccag3’; CatSper4, forward: 5’gaggagcaagtgctcatcaa3’,
reverse:5’gcagaagttgtcgcatgtgt3’) were designed according to the homologous regions of CatSper mRNAs
from human, cattle, dog, and pig, which are available
in the NCBI database. Because of their prolonged coding sequence, only partial fragments of CatSper1, CatSper2 and CatSper4 genes were amplified; whereas,
CatSper3 is possesses a short and full length of cDNA
product facilitating a full length sequence product with
RACE. The PCR procedure was carried out as follows:
denatured at 94°C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles of
94°C 30 sec, 60°C 30 sec and 72°C 60 sec, and final
extension at 72°C for 5 min. The PCR products of CatSper1, CatSper2 and CatSper4 were inserted into the
pMD18-T TA clone vector (TaKaRa) and sequenced.
Based on the cloned sequences and porcine CatSper
nucleotide sequence already available in the NCBI
database, gene specific primers (refer to Table 1) for
CatSper genes were further designed and used to
amplify the 5’ and 3’ ends of CatSper cDNAs by using
GeneRacer™ kit (Invitrogen). The final PCR products
were cloned into pMD18-T TA clone vector (TaKaRa)
and sequenced. The sequenced fragments were
assembled to construct the full length of CatSper
cDNAs. The resulting sequences were analyzed for
similarity with other species by using the on-line
BLAST program [19].

Bioinformatics analysis

Based on the CatSper gene sequence, the amino acid
orthologous sequences were deduced. The deduced porcine amino acid sequences and the ones for human,
mouse, rat, cattle, and dog from NCBI database were
aligned by using the CLUSTALW2 program [20]. The
transmembrane domains in the protein alignment of
CatSpers were predicted by tmap program [21]. The
coiled coil motifs in porcine CatSper proteins were analyzed by COILS program [22].
RT-PCR assay

The qualitative reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect the spatial
expression of CatSper genes, and the quantitative realtime RT-PCR was used to examine the temporal
expression of CatSper genes during testicular development. Primers (list in Table 2) were redesigned based

on sequences of cloned CatSper cDNAs and PCR protocols were summarized in Table 2. Porcine glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), a
housekeeping gene, was used as a positive control to
confirm the presence of cDNA. Thirty and 35 cycles
were applied for GAPDH and CatSper gene amplifications in organ samples, respectively. To detect the
expression of CatSper genes in sperm, 42 cycles were
applied and the purity of sperm RNAs was determined
by RT-PCR with three sets of primers (list in Table 2)
amplifying c-kit, CD4 and E-Cadherin cDNA, which
are positive marker for testicular germ cells, leukocytes
and epithelial cells, respectively [16,23]. The quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed on an ABI 7500
Fast Real-Time PCR System (ABI) with SYBR® Premix
Ex Taq™II (TaKaRa) according to the protocol summarized in Table 2. The threshold cycles (Ct ) of CatSper genes were normalized with GAPDH. Relative

quantification of the expression of genes was calculated
using the 2-ΔΔCt method [24].
Statistical analysis

The expression level of CatSper genes in testes were calculated at each time point. Data were analyzed by using
SPSS16 for Windows Software and presented as Mean ±
SEM. Differences of gene expression level between ages
were analyzed by ANOVA, followed by post hoc tests
by using the LSD test and the statistical significance was
accepted when P was less than 0.05 (compared with
their former time point).

Results
Molecular cloning of porcine CatSper cDNAs

The available porcine CatSpers cDNA sequences from
the NCBI database [25] included 125 bp for CatSper1
[GenBank:AM947645], 137 bp for CatSper2 [GenBank:
AM947646], 169 bp for CatSper3 [GenBank:AM947647]
and 174 bp for CatSper4 [GenBank:AM947648]. To
facilitate the 5’RACE, three sets of primers correspond
to CatSper1, CatSper2 and CatSper4 cDNAs were
designed, according to the available CatSper nucleotide
sequences of pig and the conserved sequences of CatSpers among other mammals. Three PCR products of
CatSper1, CatSper2 and CatSper4 cDNAs with expected
size of 650 bp, 450 bp, and 900 bp were obtained (Figure 1). Then, the purified cDNA products were inserted
into TA clone vectors and sequenced. The sequencing
results were confirmed by analyzing for similarity with
known CatSper sequences of other species using the
BLASTN program. The mRNA sequences, including the
5’ and 3’ un-translated regions and full-length cDNAs of
porcine CatSper1, CatSper2, CatSper3 and CatSper4
genes, were successfully obtained by RACE method.
These sequences have been deposited into GenBank
with accession number of HQ654519, HQ654520,
HQ654521, and HQ654522. The characteristics of

Page 4 of 12

porcine CatSper mRNA sequences were predicted by
DNAStar and are summarized in Table 3. The lengths
of cloned mRNA sequences of CatSper1, CatSper2, CatSper3 and CatSper4 genes were 2452, 2038, 1408, and
1799 bp, respectively. They contain 2169, 1599, 1203,
and 1350 bp open reading frames (ORFs), respectively,
flanked by 5’ and 3’ terminal un-translated regions
(Table 3).
Amino acid identity analysis cross animal species

Based on the gene sequences, the amino acid sequences
of the four porcine CatSpers were deduced. The amino
acid identity between pig and human, mouse, rat, cattle,
and dog (access number refer to Table 4) was then analyzed by using CLUSTALW multiple sequence alignment program. The alignment data showed that the
regions across the ion transport domains were predictably highly conserved (Figure 2). In contrast low
sequence identity in the N and C-terminals, and other
regions was observed. Six transmembrane domains (S1S6) in the protein alignment were predicted by tmap
program. A short, conserved hydrophobic stretch representing the pore-forming region is present in a longer
loop region between the fifth and sixth transmembrane
domains (Figure 2). The sequences in the pore loop
represented a similar conserved motif (T×D×W) (Figure
2), which is characterized in voltage-gated calcium channels [26]. Overall, the amino acid sequences of these
motifs also appear to be highly conserved across species
(Figure 2). A coiled-coil domain at the C terminus of
each member of the porcine CatSper family was predicted by COILS program and shown in Figure 3. This
domain is well characterized as potential protein-protein
interaction motif with various complexes [27].
The protein sequence identities between CatSper
family members were also analyzed and were presented
in Table 4. Furthermore, a phylogenic tree was constructed based on the alignment result (Figure 4). Overall, CatSper2, CatSper3, and CatSper4 forms were highly
conserved. The sequence identity ranges from 67.6%
(mouse vs. human) to 88.5% (pig vs. dog) for CatSper2
orthologs, 60.8% (rat vs. dog) to 85.0% (pig vs. rat) for
CatSper3, and 62.3% (rat vs. cattle) to 85.1% (pig vs. rat)
for CatSper4 (Table 4). CatSper1 was under a lower

evolutionary constraint with sequence identity varying
from 45.7% (rat vs. mouse) to 76.3% (pig vs. dog) (Table
4). The phylogenic tree indicated that CatSpers (CatSper1-4) were highly clustered together in dog, pig, and
cattle, then with human, and finally with rat and mouse
(Figure 4), which is in agreement with the sequence
identity distribution for each of them (Table 4). CatSper1 and CatSper4 proteins across species displayed
the greatest degree of homology, as evidenced by their
tight clustering in gene comparisons, then with CatSper3. CatSper2 protein was clearly distinct from the
other members of the family (Figure 4).
Spatial expression of CatSper genes

To determine the spatial expression pattern, complementary DNA was synthesized from 14 non-reproductive organs, 12 reproductive organs, and sperm samples
of adult Chinese Meishan pigs. It was found that only
the testes expressed the CatSper2 transcript, implying
that evolved selectively to support normal testicular
function. CatSper1 was only identified in testes and
hypothalamus; whereas CatSper4 mRNA was expressed

in both testes and rete testes. CatSper3 mRNA was
expressed in several organs tested, with strong signal
detected in cerebellum, pituitary, hippocampus, testes
and rete testes, and faint signal in brain, heart, caput
epididymidis, prostate and seminal vesicle (Figure 5).
None of these genes was expressed in the ovary and
uterus of female pigs. All RT-PCR products of CatSper
genes were confirmed by sequencing.
To determine the transcripts of CatSper genes in ejaculated sperm, the swim-up technique was applied to
decrease the potential contamination by somatic cells.
Then, the sperm RNA samples were then further
assessed for purity and gene expression by using an RTPCR primers directed against c-kit, CD4, and E-Cadherin makers for germ cells, leukocytes, and principal
epithelial cells, respectively [16,23]. Sperm samples without detectable contamination for other cell types were
then employed for RT-PCR analysis of CatSper genes.
The predicted genes were observed in positive control
cDNAs and no signal was detected in negative control
cDNA. GAPDH was used as the loading control with
detection of this transcript after 35 PCR cycles, while c-

kit, CD4, and E-Cadherin was not observed even after
42 cycles (Figure 6). CatSper3 and CatSper4 were
detected in sperm with 42 PCR cycles, but the transcripts of CatSper1 and CatSper2 were not detectable
within this allotted time (Figure 6).
Temporal expression of CatSperm genes

The temporal expression profile of CatSper mRNAs
during testicular development was determined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Their expression levels at different stage of development after birth from day 1 to
150 of age were summarized in Figure 7. At Days 1 and
30, CatSper1, CatSper3 and CatSper4 were not detectable, while Catsper2 began to be transcribed and was
detected at a low level by Day 1. This low expression
level was maintained until Day 30; whereupon, the
expression of this gene transcript increased dramatically
from Days 30 to 60 (Figure 7). After Day 60, all CatSper
genes were abundantly expressed, and maintained at

seemingly high constitutive level without alteration until
Day 150 (Figure 7), which is the last age that was
analyzed.

Discussion
The CatSper proteins 1-4 form heterotetrameric, pH,
and voltage dependent Ca 2+ permeable ion channels
that are essential for hyperactivated motility and
required for male fertility in mice [1,3,6,8,28]. CatSpers1-4-null mice are infertile and the spermatozoa fail
to develop hyperactivated motility. These proteins have
been studied extensively for their functionality and roles
in reproduction in the mouse and human. However, no
information is available in the pig. In the present study,
we reported the full-length sequence of the four porcine
CatSper cDNAs and deduced the amino acid sequences
based on their gene sequences and further analyzed for
their presumptive protein structure. The expression of
these genes in different organs, in the male and female

genital tracts, and in ejaculated sperm was investigated
by qualitative RT-PCR. Furthermore, their gene expression patterns in the testes were studied by quantitative
real-time RT-PCR from birth till sexual maturity (day
150 of age) as well. To our knowledge, this is the first
report in pigs to show the spatial and temporal expression of porcine CatSper genes.
The CatSpers, belonging to the members of the voltage-gated ion channel superfamily [29], contain four
alpha subunits (CatSper1-4) [30], and two auxiliary subunits, CatSperb and CatSperg [4,5]. In the current study,
24 CatSper protein sequences of four alpha subunits
(CatSper1-4) from cattle, dog, human, mouse, pig and
rat were analyzed and the transmembrane motifs were
predicted by tmap program. As common protein
domains found in the ion pore-forming subunits of this
channel superfamily [2,9,26], six transmembrane regions
denoted S1-S6 and a membrane re-entrant loop between
S5 and S6 that forms part of the ion conducting pore
were predicted. High species sequence identity and similar conserved pattern across the transmembrane and
pore forming domains were revealed by multi-

Page 8 of 12

alignment. These data suggest the functional importance
of these domains in regulation of sperm mobility and
fertility.
Coiled-coils, a structural motif in proteins, in which 27 alpha-helices are coiled together like the strands of a
rope[31], are well characterized as potential protein-protein interaction domains [32,33]. Such areas have also
been found in multi-protein complexes such as the
SNARE complex [27]. All four of the porcine CatSpers
was predicted to contain a putative protein interaction
motif near the carboxyl terminus in the current study.
As discussed previously for mouse and human CatSpers
[2,11,13], these regions could play important roles in the
formation of CatSper complex. However, experiments
are needed to address the roles of the putative CatSper
protein interaction motifs have not been reported.
The spatial expression of CatSpers in different organs
has been studied in the mouse and human. In both species, CatSper1, 2 and 3 are exclusively expressed in the
testes, not in other organs [1,3,11,13]. In mice, CatSper
4 is only expressed in the testes not in other organs
[11]. However, in humans, CatSper4 is detected in the
testes, placenta and lung as well [2]. Based on their
restricted expression patterns and their vital roles in
sperm functions, CatSper family members are predicted
to be potential targets for male infertility screening and
ideal targets for contraception [1,13,15]. In the current
study, CatSper2 and 4 were found to be expressed in
the testes of boars among 26 organs studied, while the
expression of porcine CatSper1 was detected in both
testes and hypothalamus organs and CatSper3 was distributed extensively in the nervous organs (brain, cerebellum, pituitary, hypothalamus, hippocampus), and
male reproductive tracts (testes and rete testes, caput
epididymidis, prostate and seminal vesicle). The pattern
of CatSper3 in porcine organs contrasted with that of
mouse, which is specifically expressed in testes [3,11],
which may be explained by evolutionary divergence of
gene function across species. However, the function of
this gene in the various porcine organs is uncertain.
Expression of mouse CatSpers is thought to be androgen dependent [14,15]. CatSpers are first detected after
the first round of meiosis, which generally occurs at
about 15 days of age, and sharply up-regulated at day
21, which coincides with the appearance of round spermatids in the developing testes, and peak around Day
42, when sexual maturity is reached in the mouse [34].
In the present study, CatSper mRNAs only minimally
expressed at Days 1 and 30 of age. These transcripts
were highly expressed by Day 60, when round spermatids become evident in the cross sections of seminiferous tubules in the testes of Meishan boars, suggesting
that these germ cells are the primary source for this
gene transcript [17], These findings are in agreement

with a previous mouse study [14]. However, these forms
maintain an expression level without a precipitous
increase between Days 60 to 150, even though boars
reached sexual maturity at 120 days of age [17]. This
pattern differs from the temporal expression profile of
mouse CatSpers, which rise during this comparable
developmental time [14,15]. Perhaps, sexual maturity in
male Meishan boars is less dependent on these Catsper
proteins than male mice.
In agreement with observations of the mice [14], the
expression of the CatSper2 gene in the current study
commenced at an earlier developmental stage (Day 1)
than other CatSper genes. These differences between
the temporal expression profiles of the CatSper transcripts in porcine testis development suggest different
mechanisms govern the expression of these various

transcripts. Additionally, developmental changes in the
somatic and germ cell population of the testes might
drive these alterations [35]. It is also possible that there
is fine orchestration and function of the CatSper2 and
others forms at different stages of testis development. In
CatSper2 null mice, the males are infertile because while
spermatozoa are produced, they are not capable of forward propulsion and acquiring hyperactivated motility,
necessary for successful ability to navigate within the
female reproductive system and contact ovulated
oocytes within the oviduct [6,8,13]. The rapid expression
of CatSper2 compared to other forms and transgenic
mice studies highlights that CatSper2 might be the most
critical for normal male reproduction.
In the current study, low expression levels of CatSper3
and CatSper4 were detected in ejaculated sperm;

whereas CatSper1 and CatSper2 were not detectable
even after 42 PCR cycles. The origin of sperm RNAs
remains unclear. Several RNA populations in ejaculated
sperm of mammals [36-39], including the transcripts
encoding for some ion channels have been reported
[40]. Since the protein translation of sperm RNA has
been demonstrated by Gur and Breitbart [41], the transcripts in sperm could play an essential role for sperm
functions, such as motility, capacitation, and acrosome
reaction. Furthermore, the level of CatSper transcripts
in human ejaculated sperm has been positively correlated with overall sperm motility [14,16]. Further studies
are needed to investigate the biological role of CatSper
RNAs in porcine sperm.
While it would have strengthened these findings to
localize and verify the protein expression pattern of
these genes in the testes, this proved problematic for
several reasons. We attempted immunohistochemistry
to detect their presence of proteins by using several
antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology such as CatSper1 (H-20, sc-21181), CatSper2 (H-60, sc-98539),
CatSper3 (H-216, sc-98702); and CatSper4 (T-17, sc83126). However, specific location was not possible in
in the testes, which is presumably due to the lack of
cross reactivity for these antibodies that were developed against the protein forms for other species, and
in some cases against non-conserved regions within

these proteins. Additionally, we performed Western
Blotting with CatSper antibodies that we developed
against the porcine forms. The antibody against CatSper2 seemingly worked but several additional bands
besides the expected size band of 62 kDa were correspondingly observed. We are currently sorting out
whether these are additional bands represent isoforms
of CatSper2 or are non-specific. We are further optimizing these protein expression procedures to determine whether they match the mRNA expression
profile.

Conclusions
In summary, we have cloned the full length cDNAs of
porcine CatSper1, CatSper2, CatSper3, and CatSper4,
and characterized the spatial and temporal expression
profiles in the testes and other organs. CatSper2 and 4
were found to be testis-specific; whereas CatSper1
expression was confined to the testes and hypothalamus.
However CatSper3 was distributed extensively across
the nervous organs and male reproductive organs. The
transcripts of CatSper3 and CatSper4 were identified in
mature spermatozoa. Substantial expression of CatSper
genes was observed in the testes at 60 days of age and
with high expression levels persisting through 150 days
of age. This study provides essential molecular data that
can be employed in follow-up studies that will address
the biological roles of CatSpers in normal porcine male
reproductive function.
