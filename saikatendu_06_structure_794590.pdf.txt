Abstract
Background: The protein encoded by the SA1388 gene from Staphylococcus aureus was chosen for structure
determination to elucidate its domain organization and confirm our earlier remote homology based prediction
that it housed a nitrogen regulatory PII protein-like domain. SA1388 was predicted to contain a central PII-like
domain and two flanking regions, which together belong to the NIF3-like protein family. Proteins like SA1388
remain a poorly studied group and their structural characterization could guide future investigations aimed at
understanding their function.
Results: The structure of SA1388 has been solved to 2.0Å resolution by single wavelength anomalous dispersion
phasing method using selenium anomalous signals. It reveals a canonical NIF3-like fold containing two domains
with a PII-like domain inserted in the middle of the polypeptide. The N and C terminal halves of the NIF3-like
domains are involved in dimerization, while the PII domain forms trimeric contacts with symmetry related
monomers. Overall, the NIF3-like domains of SA1388 are organized as a hexameric toroid similar to its homologs,
E. coli ybgI and the hypothetical protein SP1609 from Streptococcus pneumoniae. The openings on either side of the
toroid are partially covered by trimeric "lids" formed by the PII domains. The junction of the two NIF3 domains
has two zinc ions bound at what appears to be a histidine rich active site. A well-defined electron density
corresponding to an endogenously bound ligand of unknown identity is observed in close proximity to the metal
site.
Conclusion: SA1388 is the third member of the NIF3-like family of proteins to be structurally characterized, the
other two also being hypothetical proteins of unknown function. The structure of SA1388 confirms our earlier
prediction that the inserted domain that separates the two NIF3 domains adopts a PII-like fold and reveals an
overall capped toroidal arrangement for the protein hexamer. The six PII-like domains form two trimeric "lids"
that cap the central cavity of the toroid on either side and provide only small openings to allow regulated entry
of small molecules into the occluded chamber. The presence of the electron density of the bound ligand may
provide important clues on the likely function of NIF3-like proteins.

Background
Despite the increased sophistication of annotation tools,
a significant number of protein sequences emerging from
genome sequencing efforts continue to remain in the
realm of "hypothetical proteins" with little or no functional annotation associated with them. Ultimately, a definite functional annotation would require experimental
characterization, which is often time consuming and
expensive. Careful remote homology detection and manual analysis has in many occasions helped to glean useful
structural and functional insights into these so-called
"hypothetical proteins". Typically, such studies involve a
combination of profile based methods like transitive PSIBLAST [1], COMPASS [2] and HMMer [3] as well as structure prediction and fold recognition methods [4-6].
One such study [7] had analyzed sequences of the ubiquitously found protein modules homologous to the nitrogen regulatory PII proteins as defined in the COG [8] and
Pfam databases [9]. This comprehensive analysis
expanded the PII protein superfamily to include five very
divergent groups of proteins, with below random (~1%)
pairwise sequence identities between some members of
distant groups. Nevertheless, each group has distinct
patches of conserved local similarities and was predicted
to retain the same overall structural fold as PII and a
trimeric structure essential for ligand-binding site formation. The PII-like proteins are small protein modules of
ferredoxin-like fold containing a core (βαβ)2 secondary
structural pattern, and function as trimers. While the
nitrogen regulatory PII proteins that belong to the Group
II of the superfamily have been studied extensively [10],
the functions of other groups in the superfamily are either
poorly understood or completely unknown. One group of
PII-like proteins, Group III, is significantly larger (~370
aa) than a typical PII protein domain (~112 aa). In these
proteins, the PII domain is embedded within the central
region of the polypeptide while the N- and C-terminal
regions together belong to the NIF3 (NGG1p interacting
factor 3)-like protein family. Presumably, the PII domain
of these proteins would play some sort of ligand binding
and signalling role analogous to that of classical PII proteins [10,11], while the function of the NIF3-like domains
is not known.
We chose the Group III proteins of the PII superfamily
(represented by the Staphylococcus aureus protein SA1388)
for structure determination with two primary objectives:
to structurally characterize both the Group III PII-like
domain and NIF3 domains which may provide clues to
their potential function that is otherwise unattainable
from sequence information alone. Apart from providing
confirmation of our prediction of the central P-II domain,
the structure of SA1388 would also be important for functional analysis of the NIF3 domains, which were recently

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/6/27

highlighted in the top 10 list of important structural targets due to their broad phylogenetic distribution,
sequence conservation patterns with putative "active-site
like" features and their uncharacterized role as a putative
regulatory molecules of eukaryotic transcription [12].

Results
Description of SA1388 monomer
The final model of SA1388 (gi:54040095 Swissprot:
P67273;) refined to 2.0Å resolution consists of two subunits in the asymmetric unit. One subunit is traceable
across the entire length of polypeptide from the N- to the
C-terminus (residues 1 to 366) with the exception of a
loop region containing 25 residues (168–193) in the central PII domain. In the other monomer, several more residues are disordered (139 – 193). A ribbon representation
of one SA1388 monomers is shown in Figure 1A.

Overall, the protein is organized into three distinct structural domains with interconnecting topological connectivities (Figure 1B). The two NIF3 domains at the N- and
C-terminus of the protein (henceforth denoted as NIF3-N
and NIF3-C, respectively) have the same overall fold as
canonical NIF3-like proteins [13,14], with a central 5
stranded mixed β-sheet and a pair of helices on either side.
NIF3-N and NIF3-C are structurally similar and are clearly
superimposable as shown in Figure 1C, and therefore are
probably a result of gene duplication.
The middle region of the polypeptide (residues 126–236)
bulges out between the two NIF3 domains and is structured as a classical PII-like fold with a (β/α/β)2 architecture (Figure 1A), confirming our earlier prediction [7].
This domain is relatively well ordered only in one of the
two monomers in the asymmetric unit. In this monomer,
although all the secondary structural elements are well
defined, we do not observe electron density for residues
169–193 that connects the strands β7 and β8. In the other
monomer, in addition to this loop, helix α6 and strand β7
are also disordered. Residues in this domain have substantially higher B factors, indicating a higher mobility
compared to the rest of the protein.
Structure comparison with other NIF3 and PII proteins
Structure comparison of the entire polypeptide of SA1388
as well as the NIF3 domains using DALI [15] clearly identified two NIF3 homologous proteins, E. coli ybgI (PDB id:
2nmo; Z score = 25.5; RMSD of 1.9Å for 230 Cα atoms)
and SP1609 from Streptococcus pneumoniae (PDB id: 2fyw;
Z score = 32.1; RMSD of 1.7 Å for 253 Cα atoms). These
two NIF3 homologs share sequence identities of 23% and
32%, respectively, with SA1388 sequence with the central
PII-like domain (residues 128–235) excluded. A superimposition of the three structures is shown in Figure 2A.
Both ybgI and SP1609 proteins have the same secondary

structural connectivities as SA1388. However, unlike
SA1388, these two proteins lack the middle PII-like
domain.
The PII-like domain of SA1388 is topologically identical
to several PII proteins with characterized structures (Figure 2B), such as GlnB [16] and GlnK [17], as well as PIIlike protein CutA [18] and the C-terminal regulatory
domain of ATP phosphoribosyltransferase (HisG) [19].
This domain has a core (βαβ)2 secondary structural pattern described in SCOP as a ferredoxin-like fold [20]. It
remains to be determined whether the SA1388 PII
domain binds ATP or other ligands either in vivo or in
vitro.
The NIF3 domains are involved in dimerization
The two SA1388 monomers in the asymmetric unit tightly
associate to form a dimer along the sides of the two NIF3
domains opposite to where the PII-domain is located. The
two subunits are arranged in a head-to-tail manner with
the NIF3-N of one subunit facing NIF3-C of the adjacent
subunit, while the NIF3-C of the same subunit is nested in
an elbow-like area between the two NIF3 domains of the
second monomer. About 1828 Å2, or ~10% of the total
surface area per monomer is buried in a largely hydrophobic (62%) interface (Figure 3A). There are also a few specific hydrogen bond interactions, including those
between the side chains of Asp44-A and His308-B, Tyr80A and Asp313-B, as well as that between the side chain of
Asp305-A and main chain amide of His308. There is no
salt bridge in the dimer interface. Additionally, the last βstrand (β16) of one monomer is part of the β-sheet of the
other monomer (Figure 3A), with four main chain hydrogen bonds formed between the two adjacent β-strands
from different monomers.
The PII-like domains are involved in trimerization
The PII-like domain juts out of the dimer on the side
opposite the dimer interface and forms homotrimers by
interacting with the PII-like domains of symmetry related
molecules along the three-fold axes (Figure 3B). The
trimeric arrangement, where the individual β-sheets of
each PII domain pack orthogonally is similar to that seen
in several PII and PII-like proteins such as glnB [16], glnK
[17], CutA [18] and the C terminal regulatory domain of
HisG among others. A superimposition of PII trimer of
SA1388 and that of ATP bound complex of E. coli glnK is
shown in Figure 3C.
SA1388 forms a capped toroidal hexamer
Further analysis of symmetry mates within the rhombohedral unit cell showed that the individual subunits are
organized into hexamers with a cage-like appearance (Figure 4). The two NIF3 domains of each of the six monomers line the walls of this hollowed toroidal structure that

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/6/27

has a central cavity of ~38Å diameter. The two NIF3
homologs, E. coli ybgI and SP1609 also assemble as hexamers in the crystals in a similar manner as that in
SA1388, but their central cavity, which is of similar
dimensions, is open at both ends. In SA1388, the two
entries to the central hollow space are capped by the two
PII domain trimers. However, this capping is not complete and leaves six smaller openings to the central cavity
that are formed between the long stems connecting the
PII-like domain and the NIF3 domains (Figure 4). The triangle shaped openings have approximate dimensions of
~20Å (length of each side of the triangle). These openings
render the inside of the SA1388 hexamer solvent accessible and should allow access for small molecules to enter
the putative active site (see below). Given the prevalent
hexameric organization in all NIF3-like protein structures
available so far, it is quite certain that the functional unit
of these proteins is a hexamer.
Description of the putative active site
We observe clear electron density for two tightly bound
metal ions at the junction of the two NIF3 domains in
each SA1388 monomer close to the protein surface that
face inside the hexameric toroid (Figure 5A). The identity
of the metal was determined to be zinc, first by an
extended X-ray fluorescence scan at synchrotron and was
further confirmed by Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP)
atomic emission spectrometry. We have therefore modelled two zinc atoms at the putative active site. Both metal
atoms are tethered to the protein through several histidine
and aspartate residues. Residue Glu329 is coordinated to
both metal ions, while a water molecule, or more likely a
hydroxide ion, also bridges the two metal ions. The configuration of this dinuclear metal center is very similar to
that of the diiron site found in its E. coli homolog ybgI
[14], and is reminiscent of the dinuclear mu-oxo diiron
sites found in hemerythrins [21], ribonucleotide reductases [22] and purple acid phosphatase [23]. Some of the
conserved residues at the metal center in the two structures along with that of SP1609 are shown in Figure 5A.
The metal binding sites are remarkably similar in the three
NIF3-like protein structures (E. coli ybgl, SP1609, and
SA1388) and consist primarily of five histidines, one
glutamate and one aspartate. These residues are among
the most conserved residues in the NIF3-like protein
superfamily.

Additionally, we observe a clear electron density for a ligand of unknown identity in close proximity to the two
bound zinc atoms that would provide two additional
metal ligands, one to each of the two metal ions to complete the octahedral metal center configuration (Figure
5B). By trial and error, we have ruled out all components
in the crystallization solution that might have been inadvertently bound either during crystallization or during

cryoprotection and therefore conclude that the observed
ligand must in fact be an endogenously bound ligand that
was co-purified after recombinant overexpression. The
contours of the difference electron density map (Figure
5B) after final refinement suggests the presence of a head
group directly ligated to the metal ions and a mostly
aliphatic tail that has few specific polar interactions with
the surrounding protein residues (Figure 5B). Two aromatic residues, a tyrosine (Y289, shown in Figure 5A) and
a tryptophan (W22) lie in close proximity to the bound
ligand and may be involved in ligand binding.

Although homologs of both PII and NIF3 proteins are
found ubiquitously in all three kingdoms of life, the function of SA1388 and its homologs that contain both PIIlike and NIF3-like domains remain completely unknown.
The fusion of the two proteins in one peptide chain indicates a functional coupling of these two proteins. The
structural features revealed in the present study, such as
the cage-like hexameric toroid structure with its NIF3
domains as walls and the two PII-like domain trimers as
lids, the dinuclear metal site, and the intrinsically bound
ligand, may provide certain clues of its potential function.
The primary role of the nitrogen regulatory PII proteins is
to integrate various intracellular carbon and nitrogen signals by regulating enzymes involved in nitrogen assimilation [10]. PII exerts its regulatory effects by undergoing
different post translational modifications, such as uridylylation [24] and phosphorylation [25] by various modifying enzymes in response to the primary cellular nitrogen
signal glutamine. Structures of several PII and PII-like proteins have been solved including glnB (from E. coli, T.
thermophilus, Synecococcus and Herbaspirillum), GlnA (E.
coli), glnK (E. coli), HisG (E. coli and M. tuberculosis),
CutA1 (human, rat and T. maritima), and a hypothetical
protein from COG1993. Effectors of PII include transcription factors [10,11], signalling proteins e.g., histidine
kinases [26], and metabolic enzymes like glutamine synthase [27]. Apart from its primary signalling modulator
glutamine, PII proteins are known to bind a range of small
molecule effectors such as ATP, UMP, and 2-ketoglutarate,
which affects its function antagonistically to glutamine
(reviewed in [10]). It is highly likely that the trimeric PII
domain of SA1388 also plays a ligand induced signalling
role and probably regulates the function of the NIF3-like
domains.
Unlike PII domains, the NIF3-like domains have only
recently begun to be structurally characterized, and their
structure-function relationship remains sketchy. NIF3-like
proteins are ubiquitously conserved from bacteria to
higher eukaryotes [28]. They have been defined in uniprot
database as the uncharacterized protein family UPF0135
that has 64 homologs [29]. Several homologs of this fam-

BMC Structural Biology 2006, 6:27

ily (e.g., human and mouse) have a similar overall threedomain organization as in SA1388, while others (e.g., E.
coli and Methanococcus) have only the NIF3 domains with
the PII-like domain being absent. Experiments on spermatogonia derived cell line GC-1 suggest that nif3L1 (Ngg1interacting factor 3-like 1) gene, a homolog of sa1388,
expresses copiously during embryonic development and
participates in retinoic acid-primed neural differentiation
by interacting with the transcriptional corepressor Trip15/
CSN2 [28]. Its primary role appears to be to inhibit Ngg1p
from translocation to the nucleus, presumably by forming
a binary complex in the cytoplasm [13]. Yeast two hybrid
studies have shown that NIF3 binds to the amino terminal
region of NGG1, an interaction that was implicated as a
means of limiting transcriptional activation of GAL4p in
glucose rich medium [30]. Furthermore, a genomewide
two-hybrid analysis of yeast protein-protein interactions
suggests that yeast NIF3p interacts with a nuclear import/
export protein (Srp1p) and a ras-like GTPase (Temp1p),
which are both required for proper exit from mitosis in
the cell cycle [31]. In E. coli, expression of NIF3 homolog
ybgI increases dramatically upon genotoxic stress induced
by DNA damage [32]. This observation might be significant in light of the structure reported here because proteins that have been implicated in processes involving
DNA metabolism often adopt toroidal structures [33-35].
However, the active site observed for SA1388 in this study,
along with that seen in ybgI are not similar to the previously characterized DNA interacting toroids (e.g., the λ
exonuclease [34]).
Although the precise biochemical function of the NIF3like proteins are not known, the presence of a binuclear
metal center similar to those found in hemerythrins, ribonucleotide reductases and purple acid phosphatase, as
well as the endogenously bound ligand in the current
structure strongly suggest that SA1388 NIF3 domains and
E. coli Ybgl proteins likely bind and perform some form of
catalysis on small molecule ligands, possibly metabolic
substrates, and whose function may be regulated by the
PII-like domains. In an attempt to determine the chemical
identity of the endogenous ligand, we have extracted the
ligand from the purified protein by trichloroacetic acid
(TCA)/acetone precipitation. The preliminary high-resolution mass spectroscopic analysis of the TCA/acetone
extract suggested that the ligand might be a compound of
novel chemical composition. Crystallization of the compound has not been successful probably due to its intrinsic structural flexibility, which may not be susceptible for
crystallization. Alternative approaches, such as NMR spectroscopy, may be needed in order to determine the chemical formulas and three-dimensional structure of the
endogenous ligand.

Conclusion
The recent upsurge in structures of a large number of
hypothetical proteins by structural genomics efforts continue to provide important leads in the eventual determination of their function. This success has been largely due
to either similarity of the overall structure, or local relatedness of catalytic residues to proteins of known function.
Proteins with novel, previously unknown folds however
are often limited in providing functional clues because of
lack of similarity to any experimentally characterized proteins. Sometimes, the fortuitous observation of endogenously bound ligands offers important clues in this
direction. The dinuclear metal center and the presence of
a bound ligand at the active site of the NIF3 domain of
SA1388 combined with the structural analysis of the two
NIF3 homologs, ybgI and SA1609 should aid in the functional assignment of this widespread protein family.

Methods
Cloning, purification and crystallization
The gene coding for SA1388 was PCR amplified from
genomic DNA of Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC, 700699D,
Manassas, VA) and was cloned into a pProEX (Invitrogen)
prokaryotic expression vector containing a trc promoter,
6xHis tag, and a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site. The resulting plasmid was transformed into the E.
coli strain C41(DE3) (Imaxio, Clermont-Ferrand, France)
for protein expression. Expression was induced at OD600
of 0.4 and the cells were pelleted after overnight growth at
20°C. Protein was first purified with a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA)-agarose column (Qiagen) followed by
cleavage of the N-terminal His tag by TEV protease. The
protein was further purified by anion exchange chromatography on a MonoQ column (Amersham Biosciences)
using a linear gradient of salt (Equilibration buffer: 50
mM Tris pH 7.8, 1 mM DTT; Elution buffer 50 mM Tris
pH 7.8, 1 M NaCl, 1 mM DTT) and finally by gel-filtration
chromatography on a Superdex 200 column (Amersham
Biosciences) that was pre-equilibrated with a buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH 7.8, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT.
The selenomethionine-substituted SA1388 protein was
expressed in the minimum medium supplemented with
selenomethionine and other nutrients according to standard protocols [36] and purified using the same procedure
described above. Pure fractions of native and SeMet proteins were verified by SDS-PAGE and concentrated to 20
mg/ml for crystallization in a buffer containing 50 mM
HEPES pH 7.2, 2 mM DTT and 250 mM NaCl. Crystals of
SA1388 were grown by hanging drop vapour diffusion
method. Single crystals of sizes around 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.2
mm3 appeared within 3 days in the condition with 0.1 M
Bis-Tris propane, pH 8.5, 0.2 M MgCl2 and 30% PEG 400
as the well solution. Crystals were directly frozen in liquid
propane and stored in liquid nitrogen until data collec-

tion. All crystallographic data was processed using
HKL2000 [37]

listed in Table 1. Structure factors and the coordinates
have been deposited in the PDB (code 2NYD).

Structure determination and refinement
Structure of SA1388 was solved by single wavelength
anomalous dispersion (SAD) method. Initial phases were
obtained from a complete 2.3 Å anomalous dataset collected at the peak wavelength of selenium at Advanced
Photon Source (Argonne, IL), beamline 19-BM (SBCCAT). Phasing using SOLVE [38] identified 16 (out of 22)
selenium atoms with occupancies between 0.47–0.94 and
figure of merit (FOM) of 0.31. Density modification with
RESOLVE [39] assuming two molecules in the asymmetric
unit (which gives Matthews' coefficient of 2.59 and solvent content of 53%) resulted in a clearly interpretable
electron density map and an improved FOM of 0.67.
Phases from RESOLVE were merged with a high resolution (2.0Å) native dataset using CAD of CCP4 suite followed by phase extension using DM [40] Automated
model building program ARP-wARP [41] was able to
build 63% of the protein residues including sidechains,
mostly from the two NIF3 domains. The model was
improved by alternating cycles of manual model building
and refinement using Refmac5 of the CCP4 program suite
[42,43]. The final statistics and refinement parameters are

Metal ion determination
X-ray fluorescence scans were performed at the Advanced
Photon Source (APS) beam line 19-BM at Argonne
National Laboratory on a native SA1388 crystal. Metal
analysis was also conducted on a Perkin Elmer Optima
3300 DV Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) atomic emission spectrometer calibrated with AccuStandard ICP
Multi-Element solutions. The protein was first dialyzed
against a buffer containing 50 mM Hepes, pH7.5 and 1
mM DTT, and then diluted to appropriate concentrations
for ICP atomic emission spectra analysis. The dialysis
buffer was used as blank.

Authors' contributions
KSS performed data collection, structure determination,
structure-function analysis, and drafting of the manuscript. XZ cloned, expressed, purified and crystallized both
native and SeMET forms of the protein. LK and NVG provided significant bioinformatics input and target selection
in the project. ML performed ICP atomic emission and
ICP mass spectrometry analysis. HZ coordinated all the
components of the project, critically edited the manu-
