Abstract
We describe the genetic diversity of currently transmitted strains of HIV-1 in men who have sex
with men (MSM) in Buenos Aires, Argentina between 2000 and 2004. Nearly full-length sequence
analysis of 10 samples showed that 6 were subtype B, 3 were BF recombinant and 1 was a triple
recombinant of subtypes B, C and F. The 3 BF recombinants were 3 different unique recombinant
forms. Full genome analysis of one strain that was subtype F when sequenced in pol was found to
be a triple recombinant. Gag and pol were predominantly subtype F, while gp120 was subtype B;
there were regions of subtype C interspersed throughout. The young man infected with this strain
reported multiple sexual partners and sero-converted between May and November of 2004. This
study reported for the first time the full genome analysis of a triple recombinant between subtypes
B, C and F, that combines in one virus the three most common subtypes in South America.

Findings
The great genetic diversity of human immunodeficiency
virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains have been recognized since
early in the epidemic. Phylogenetic analyses of HIV-1
have revealed the presence of at least 9 subtypes (A-D, FH, J and K) and 16 circulating recombinant forms (CRFs)
worldwide [1].

In Argentina, previous molecular studies have revealed
the presence of two epidemics; the first, among men who
have sex with men (MSM), where the viral strains are
mostly subtype B, and the second among heterosexuals
and injecting drug users where BF recombinants predominate [2,3]. Further sequencing studies have also revealed
the presence of a new CRF, the CRF12_BF [4] and subtype

C [5]. These findings highlight the complex nature of the
HIV epidemic in this country.

ignated relative to HXB-2 (Genbank accession number:
K03455).

In this study, we performed nearly full-length genetic
sequencing of 10 HIV-1 incident cases who seroconverted
in a cohort study among MSM participants in Buenos
Aires, Argentina, between the years 2002 and 2005 [6].

Nearly full-length sequence analysis of 10 HIV-1 incident
samples revealed that 6 of them were non-recombinant
subtype B and 4 were recombinants (Figures 1a and 1b).
Boostcan analysis showed that 3 of the 4 recombinants
were BF recombinants (AR163052, AR158637,
AR115455) and each of them had a unique recombination structure (Figure 1b). However, the recombinant
sample AR160677 contained sequences corresponding to
subtypes B, C and F (Figure 2).

Only those subjects who were willing to participate and
provided written informed consent were enrolled. Study
participants provided clinic-epidemiologic data using a
standardized questionnaire. A sample of anti-coagulated
blood was collected in sterile fashion for peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) separation. PBMC were separated by Ficoll-Hypaque and maintained at -70°C. PBMCs
were used for DNA extraction by the QIAmp DNA extraction kit (QIAgen, Valencia, CA, USA). All samples were
subjected to nearly full-length. PCR amplification using
the Expand Long Template PCR System (Roche Applied
Science, Penzberg, Germany) and a hot start method
using a melting wax barrier (Dynawax). The first-round
amplification was performed in a volume of 50 μl with
primers
MSF12b
(5'-AAATCTCTAGCAGTGGCGCCCGAACAG-3')
and
OFMR1
(5'-TGAGGGATCTCTAGTTACCAGAGTC-3'). The second-round
amplification was completed using 1μl of the first-round
product and primers F2NST (5'-GCGGAGGCTAGAAGGAGAGAGATGG-3') and UNINEF 7 (5'-GCACTCAAGGCAAGCTTTATTGAGGCTTA-3'). This nested strategy
amplifies about 9000kb of the HIV genome and was
slightly modified from that used previously [7,8]. The
amplified products were then sequenced with Big Dye terminators using an ABI 3100 automated sequencer
(Applied Biosystems Inc, Foster City CA).
All sequences were assembled using the software
Sequencher (Genecoes Inc., Ann Arbor MI) and examined
in a multiple alignment with standard subtype references
(Clustal X). Phylogenetic analyses were then conducted
using Neighbor-joining method with Kimura's twoparameter model of distance calculation; bootstrap analysis was performed with 100 replicas. To study the ancestral
relationships of triple recombinant sequence we conducted a Maximum Parsimony Analysis. Trees were constructed with the software PAUP version 4.0 (Sinaur
Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA) using tree-bisectionreconnection branch swapping (hold 10000) and bootstrap analysis (100 replicates).
Boostcan analysis and a visual inspection of the alignment
were used to determine the presence of recombination
and to locate breakpoints [7]. After the identification of
the breakpoints, each segment was extracted and subjected to phylogenetic analysis to confirm the subtype
assignment. Recombinant breakpoint locations were des-

The structure of this new BCF recombinant showed that
gag and pol were predominantly subtype F, while env was
mostly subtype B; there were regions of subtype C interspersed throughout (Figures 2a and 2b). The subtype
assignments of individual regions of this strain were confirmed in individual analysis shown in Figure 2a. Separate
analysis confirmed the subtype assignments made by
bootscan analysis; the only exception to this was the first
segment, which could not be assigned with confidence to
any subtype using any analytic techniques. This may be
due to the presence of multiple short fragments of some
or all of the 3 subtypes. In addition, maximum parsimony
analysis suggested that the subtype C segments of this new
recombinant had a common origin with subtype C strains
from Brazil; however, no specific origin forsubtypes B or F
could be detected (data not shown).
The recombinant sample belonged to a 26-year old man
who reported having had multiple male sexual partners,
including one from Brazil, and who seroconverted
between May and November of 2004. This patient
reported a syndrome compatible with primary HIV-1
infection [9] which included symptoms of fever, fatigue,
myalgia, arthralgia, headaches, lymphadenopathy, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, cough, anorexia, and weight loss
of 5 kilograms (11 pounds) within 40 days of HIV diagnosis. The viral load was 64,050 copies per cubic milliliter
(log 4.807) and the CD4 count was 391 cells per cubic
milliliter. At that time the patient was negative for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and syphilis infections.
This study describes the first nearly full-length genome
analysis of HIV-1 from MSM seroincident cases in Buenos
Aires, Argentina. Subtype B was found to be the most
common strain, however, three samples were found to be
BF recombinants, and one sample was identified as a triple recombinant between subtypes B, C and F. Two of the
BF recombinants shared some breakpoints with the
CRF12_BF [4]; meanwhile, sample AR163052 showed a
different pattern of recombination, suggesting that these
samples originated via different recombination events.

Phylogenetic analysis of 10 nearly full-length sequences from acutely infected (seroincident) MSM participants
in Buenos Aires, Argentina. A) A neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree analysis was performed with the Kimura two-parameter method of distance estimation using reference sequences. The genetic distance corresponding to the lengths of the
branches is shown by the bottom line. Studied samples are in bold. Underlined samples are inter-subtype recombinants. B) The
bootscan analysis of nearly full length sequences of tree recombinant BF virus and CRF_12. This analysis was performed comparing the sample with subtype C (consensus of ETH2220, 92BR025 and IN21068), subtype B (consensus of WR27, MN and
RL42) and subtype F (consensus of VI850, FIN9363 and BR020). A 300 nt window advanced in 20 nt increments was used.

Sample AR160677 represents the first triple recombinant
of subtypes B, C and F identified in the region using nearly
full-length genome sequencing. A report of a partial
sequence of a BCF recombinant has been previously
reported from southern Brazil [10], however, the subtype
structure of that Brazilian recombinant is different from
the structure of the triple recombinant being described.
We do not have additional patient information to determine if the HIV infection was due to a single infection
with an already-circulating strain or it represented the
result of two (or three) separate infections (i.e. superinfections) which ultimately lead to this unique strain as double and triple HIV infection has been previously described
[12].

These recombinants have emerged in geographic areas
where diverse HIV-1 genetic forms are co-circulating and
where recombinant viruses are continually being generated in persons infected with two or more variants. Continued efforts to monitor the genetic makeup of HIV
strains are critical in order to better assess the ongoing
nature of the HIV epidemic in this region as illustrated by
this case report.
