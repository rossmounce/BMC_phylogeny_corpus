Abstract
Background: Akirins are nuclear proteins that form part of an innate immune response pathway
conserved in Drosophila and mice. This studies aim was to characterise the evolution of akirin gene
structure and protein function in the eukaryotes.
Results: akirin genes are present throughout the metazoa and arose before the separation of
animal, plant and fungi lineages. Using comprehensive phylogenetic analysis, coupled with
comparisons of conserved synteny and genomic organisation, we show that the intron-exon
structure of metazoan akirin genes was established prior to the bilateria and that a single protoorthologue duplicated in the vertebrates, before the gnathostome-agnathan separation, producing
akirin1 and akirin2. Phylogenetic analyses of seven vertebrate gene families with members in
chromosomal proximity to both akirin1 and akirin2 were compatible with a common duplication
event affecting the genomic neighbourhood of the akirin proto-orthologue. A further duplication of
akirins occurred in the teleost lineage and was followed by lineage-specific patterns of paralogue
loss. Remarkably, akirins have been independently characterised by five research groups under
different aliases and a comparison of the available literature revealed diverse functions, generally in
regulating gene expression. For example, akirin was characterised in arthropods as subolesin, an
important growth factor and in Drosophila as bhringi, which has an essential myogenic role. In
vertebrates, akirin1 was named mighty in mice and was shown to regulate myogenesis, whereas
akirin2 was characterised as FBI1 in rats and promoted carcinogenesis, acting as a transcriptional
repressor when bound to a 14-3-3 protein. Both vertebrate Akirins have evolved under
comparably strict constraints of purifying selection, although a likelihood ratio test predicted that
functional divergence has occurred between paralogues. Bayesian and maximum likelihood tests
identified amino-acid positions where the rate of evolution had shifted significantly between
paralogues. Interestingly, the highest scoring position was within a conserved, validated binding-site
for 14-3-3 proteins.
Conclusion: This work offers an evolutionary framework to facilitate future studies of eukaryotic
akirins and provides insight into their multifaceted and conserved biochemical functions.

Background
Akirin is a recently discovered protein with an essential
function in the Drosophila melanogaster immune deficiency
(Imd) pathway, which responds to gram-negative bacte-

rial infection [1]. Akirin was strictly localised to the
nucleus and acted in concert with Relish (a fly homologue
of the vertebrate NF-kB transcription factor) to induce the
expression of a subset of downstream pathway compoPage 1 of 20

nents [1]. The knockdown of the fly akirin gene caused a
lethal embryonic phenotype [1]. akirin is conserved in vertebrates as at least two genes that were named akirin1 and
akirin2 [1]. In mice, akirin2 functions in the toll-like receptor (TLR), tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin
(IL)-1β signalling pathways, again at the level of/downstream of NF-kB to induce the transcription of several
immune-response genes including the anti-inflammatory
cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) [1]. The knockout of the
individual mammalian akirin copies produced distinct
phenotypes; whereas akirin1-/- mice had no obvious phenotype, ablation of the akirin2 gene was embryonic-lethal
[1]. Thus, seemingly, the role of invertebrate akirin in
embryonic development and the innate immune
response is most strongly conserved in akirin2 and akirin1
may have diverged in function [1]. While it is clear that
vertebrate akirin 1 and 2 are closely related, it is unknown
whether they form part of a larger gene family related by
gene duplication. Further, the exact origin and evolutionary relationships of akirin1 and akirin2 are not established.
In this paper we provide a detailed examination of the
evolution of the akirin gene family in eukaryotes. Using an
exhaustive computational screen including non-model
species, we show that a single akirin proto-orthologue is
highly conserved across invertebrate metazoans in terms
of genomic organisation and coding features and identify
orthologues in several more basal eukaryotes. Robust phylogenetic analysis revealed that akirin duplicated in a common chordate ancestor before the separation of jawed and
jawless vertebrate lineages. We show that akirin genes
have been characterised independently on several occasions, and suggest that a single, simple nomenclature system is employed in future studies. By bringing together
the available akirin literature and examining the divergent
molecular evolution of Akirin1 and 2 coding sequences,
we provide significant insight into the multiple functions
of this small gene family. A common feature of Akirins is
to regulate gene transcription in several characterised signalling pathways, seemingly through interactions with
intermediary factors such as 14-3-3 proteins.

Results and Discussion
akirin nomenclature
Future studies of akirin genes would benefit from a common nomenclature system to aid the dissemination of
results between different research groups. Of the current
names utilised, we suggest that the naming system
employed by Goto et al. [1] is used in future submissions,
since it is derived from the most detailed functional analysis and suitably describes the evolutionary relationships
of different orthologues and paralogues. The designation
'FBI1' [2] (i.e. for akirin2) is also founded on important
functional data, but is very similar to a gene named factor

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/34

binding IST protein 1 (FBI-1: NP_056982) and as with the
name 'Mighty' [3] (i.e. akirin1), does not account for evolutionary relationships within the gene family.
The origin of akirin predates the metazoan lineage
An akirin proto-orthologue was not identified in the Bacterial or Archeal genomes examined, which either
excludes a prokaryotic origin, or means that insufficient
phylogenetic signal remains to identify these ancient
orthologues. The earliest eukaryotes in which an akirin
gene was retrieved were the protist taxa Alveolata (in Guillardia theta) and Heterolobosea (in Naegleria gruberi) (fig.
1). The Alveolata and the Euglenozoa (which are phylogenetically closely related to the Heterolobosea, [4]) are
thought to have arisen close to 2 billion years ago [5]. This
places an origin for akirin prior to the split of animal/
plant/fungi lineages. However, an akirin gene was not
identified in any plant or fungal genome as previously
noted [1], although it was represented in the Amoebozoa
(in Dictyostelium discoideum) and the choanoflagellate
Monosiga brevicollis (fig. 1), which branches as the closest
known outgroup to metazoans [6]. The presence of an akirin gene was an exception rather than a rule in non-animal
eukaryotic genomes. This is consistent with the independent non-functionalization of akirin in many eukaryotic
lineages, before it obtained a fundamental function in the
metazoans.
Genomic organisation of eukaryotic akirins
In D. discoideum and N. gruberi, akirin comprises a single
exon, whereas M. brevicollis has conserved a 3-exon gene
(fig. 2a). Choanoflagellates are the closest known living
relatives to metazoans and its genes are comparably rich
in intronic sequences [6]. Thus, relative to these more
basal eukaryotes, it might be expected that certain features
of the M. brevicollis akirin proto-orthologue would be conserved with animal akirins. While the two exon-exon
boundaries of the choanoflagellate gene are not conserved
with any metazoans (not shown), a string of 4 codons
(ATG-GCC-TGC-GCG) 38 nucleotides into the second
exon code the signature residues Met-Ala-Cys-Ala, conserved at the start region of all invertebrate metazoan Akirins (fig. 2a). Additionally, in close downstream
proximity to this motif, a nuclear localization signal
(NLS) (Pro-Val-Lys-Arg-Arg) is present (fig. 2a), which is
conserved in metazoan sequences. These findings suggest
that the metazoan akirin1/2 coding sequence was derived
from exons 2 and 3 of a single gene in a common ancestor
to metazoans and choanoflagellates.

A comparison of the genomic organisation of metazoan
akirins provides insight into their evolutionary heritage
(fig. 2). In all vertebrate species examined (mouse and
zebrafish shown), akirin1 and akirin2 are organized as 5
exons of comparable size and 4 more variable introns (fig.

akirin genes were retrieved from an exhaustive computational screen of eukaryotic genome and transcriptome databases. Representative sequences are mapped onto a cladogram demonstrating their phylogenetic relationships and
branches are annotated with taxonomic information about separate clades. The branching of non-metazoan taxa is adapted
from [5]. The branching of metazoan taxa is as previously demonstrated [7,8,10]. The split of akirin into two vertebrate clades
was inferred from phylogenetic results of this study. More detailed information, including further taxa where sequences were
retrieved can be found in additional file 1. * Note that akirin genes have been characterised under four other aliases: subolesin

2a). In cephalochordates (Branchiostoma floridae), akirin
also comprises 5 exons, although exon 5 is made up solely
of untranslated nucleotides (fig. 2a, shaded in vertical
lines). In fact, exon 4 of the B. floridae gene is equivalent
to exon 5 of vertebrates (fig. 2a, evidenced by conserved
position of stop codon) and the addition of exon 5 was
probably a lineage specific acquisition. In Placozoans
(Trichoplax adhaerens), akirin comprises 3 exons (fig. 2a).
In Cnidarians (Nematostella vectensis), which represent a

basal metazoan lineage that branched later than Placozoans [7,8], akirin comprises 4 exons. The boundary of
exons 1/2 of Placozoan akirin is conserved with the
boundary of exons 1/2 in all other metazoans examined
(fig. 2b). Further, the boundary of exons 2/3 of Placozoan
akirin is conserved with the boundaries of exons 2/3 in sea
anemone/amphioxus and exons 3/4 in vertebrates (fig.
2b). Additionally, the boundary of exons 2/3 and 3/4 of
the amphioxus/sea anemone genes are respectively con-

cozoans with a common ancestor to Cnidarians and Bilatarians (fig. 2b). In support of this, exon 4 of the
anemone/amphioxus proto-orthologue and vertebrate
akirin1/2 genes starts with the last three residues of the protein (consensus sequence: Tyr-Val/Leu-Ser), which are
conserved in all animals examined except Placozoans.
Subsequent to the proposed exon gain event, an intron
was seemingly inserted into exon 2 of akirin in a common
deuterostome ancestor, after the split of cephalochordates
and higher chordates, but before the event separating
akirin1 and akirin2 (fig. 2a, b). We conclude that strong
stabilising pressures have been enforced throughout
metazoan evolution to maintain the comparable genomic
organisation of present-day akirin genes across diverse
taxa, in support of ancient patterns of gene regulation.

Metazoan akirin genes
We performed an exhaustive search for akirins in animal
genomes and transcriptomes employing a broad taxonomic sampling strategy. These results are summarised in
fig. 1 and additional file 1. In virtually all diploid vertebrates examined, a single akirin1 and akirin2 gene was
identified. Almost without exception, both genes were
strongly represented among EST databases of model and
non-model vertebrate species. In common with the gnathostomes (jawed vertebrates), Petromyzon marinus (marine
lamprey) had two sequences with marked identity to akirin (fig. 1, additional file 1). However, one was an EST that
could not be identified in the Ensembl 5.9X genome preassembly and was partial at the C-terminal. Further, a single akirin orthologue was retrieved in the Myxinid (hagfish) lineage (additional file 1). In the model Avian Gallus
gallus (red jungle fowl), no akirin1 orthologue was present
in the current Ensembl genome assembly. Further, it was
not represented among ~600,000 Genbank G. gallus ESTs,
despite the presence of multiple positive akirin2 hits. Likewise, in other model birds including zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) and turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), no akirin1
orthologues were retrieved in EST databases containing
~92,000/17,500 respective sequences. Thus the absence of
akirin1 in the class Aves reflects the genuine loss of a gene
family member, rather than repeated artefacts of insufficient sequencing resolution. This is consistent with a
recent finding showing that the number of gene family
members common to tetrapods/teleosts is markedly
reduced in the class Aves [9]. Interestingly, gene families,
which, like akirins, had known roles in the immune system, were the most strongly affected [9].

served with the boundary of exons 3/4 and 4/5 in vertebrate akirin1/2 (fig. 2b). The most parsimonious
evolutionary scenario to account for these distributions of
conserved exon-exon boundaries is that firstly, an exongain event occurred in the akirin gene after the split of Pla-

In many invertebrate metazoans, a single gene was
retrieved that shared significant identity to fly akirin and
vertebrate akirin1 and akirin2 across its entire length (fig.
1, additional file 1), but had no clear identity to other
characterised or uncharacterised genes. This included several bilaterian lineages with a strong representation of

deuterostome and protostome taxa, plus more ancient
phyla including Cnidarians and Placozoans, among the
most ancient known animals [7,8]. However, an orthologue was not retrieved in sponges. A notable invertebrate
lineage lacking an akirin gene was the family Cionidae,
which has a completed high-resolution genome sequence
and an abundance of EST sequences. This is consistent
with the observation that the compact genome of Ciona
intestinalis (~150 Mb) has undergone significant gene loss
compared to other deuterostomes [10]. However, another
Ascidian (Halocynthia roretzi) has retained an akirin orthologue.
The akirin gene duplicated in a common chordate
ancestor
Since a single akirin sequence was invariably retrieved in
invertebrate/non-metazoan eukaryotes and diploid vertebrates had no more than two akirin homologues, we
hypothesised that akirin was an ancestral proto-orthologue that gave rise to two akirin paralogues in a common
vertebrate ancestor. This was tested by phylogenetic analysis using vertebrate Akirin1 and Akirin2 amino acid
sequences and the single sequence representing four
invertebrate deuterostome lineages as outgroups. The
sequence alignment is provided in additional file 2. Maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses were initially performed (fig. 3). Further, to test the
robustness of the analysis to different methods of reconstruction, we also performed neighbour joining (NJ),
minimum evolution (ME) and maximum parsimony
(MP) analyses (fig. 4). Additionally, a NJ tree was constructed solely from unsaturated positions in the alignment [11], to test the hypothesis that mutational
saturation at certain sites might influence tree topology.
Very similar topologies were retrieved by all approaches
(fig. 3 fig. 4) and a clear branching was apparent internal
to invertebrate outgroups, separating Akirin1 and Akirin2
clades (fig. 3, fig. 4, 96/90/94/95/66 % bootstrap confidence values by ML/NJ/'unsaturated' NJ/ME/MP and
100% posterior probability in Bayesian analysis). In both
Akirin clades, vertebrate sequences branched according to
established taxonomic relationships, including the
expected split of the Sarcopterygii and Actinopterygii (fig.
3, fig. 4). The included lamprey sequence (EC384219)
branched as the most external node of the vertebrate
Akirin1 clade in all trees (fig. 3, fig. 4). The partial lamprey
sequence that was not included in the phylogenetic analysis, shares higher sequence identity to akirin2 (41%),
than to akirin1 (30.5%) and could represent a lamprey
akirin2 orthologue. The single hagfish orthologue was not
used in the final phylogenetic analysis, since in preliminary reconstructions, its position was unstable and it
formed either a weakly supported branch as the most
external node of the Akirin2 clade or alternatively,
branched with more basal invertebrate outgroups. Taken

together, these results indicate that Akirin1 and Akirin2
are indeed paralogues that arose by gene duplication in a
common ancestor to the vertebrate lineage, prior to the
separation of gnathostome and agnathan lineages.
Conserved synteny between akirin1 and akirin2
containing chromosomal tracts
Next, we examined the genomic neighbourhood surrounding akirin1/2 in mammals, birds, amphibians and
fishes (fig. 5, fig. 6). In all vertebrate genomes examined,
akirin1 and akirin2, when both present, were positioned
on different chromosomes, except in mice, where they are
located on different ends of chromosome 4, separated by
~100 Mb. A comparison of genes in the neighbourhood of
akirin1 and akirin2 (i.e. separately considering fig. 5. and
fig. 6) demonstrates a strong level of conserved synteny
across vertebrate classes, with limited intra-chromosomal
rearrangements and few inter-chromosomal rearrangements in tetrapod species with known karyotypes. In teleosts, two tracts were present with conserved synteny
relative to single akirin1/akirin2-containing regions of
tetrapods (see following section). Consistent with BLAST
homology screens (fig. 1, additional file 1), an akirin1
gene was absent from the G. gallus genome and gene order
was disrupted around this region relative to mammalian
and amphibian genomes examined (fig. 5). In summary,
these results indicate that the chromosomal organisation
of akirin-containing tracts of vertebrate genomes were
conserved from a common ancestor prior to the speciation events separating the major vertebrate classes.
akirins and the teleost whole genome duplication event
A single akirin1 gene was identified in all teleost species
examined, whereas two akirin2 copies were retrieved from
Acanthopterygian taxa i.e. pufferfishes, medaka, sticklebacks and sea bream. All methods of phylogenetic analysis separated teleost akirin2 sequences into two clades (fig.
3, fig. 4). The first was represented by one of the two
sequences in species of the Acanthopterygii and the single
Ostariophysi copy (i.e. zebrafish, Danio rerio and fathead
minnow, Pimephales promelas) (fig. 3, fig. 4) The second
clade was represented by the remaining Akirin2 sequences
of Acanthopterygian species (fig. 3, fig. 4). Thus, each tree
branches prior to the split of Acanthopterygian and Ostariophysian samples, which indicates that this duplication
event occurred in a common teleost ancestor rather than
in the Acanthopterygian lineage. However, statistical confidence in this branching was weak by all methods (fig. 3,
fig. 4, 50/59/<50/68/<50% respective bootstrap support
in the ML/NJ/'unsaturated' NJ/ME/MP analyses) excepting the Bayesian analysis (fig. 3, 100% posterior probability values). Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction was
shown under certain conditions to produce an overestimate of branch confidence [12]. Thus, we also sought evidence to either provide support or refute this branching

Both methods produced near identical topologies and a strongly supported branching of separate clades for Akirin1 (red

topology, using comparisons of conserved genomic synteny. The synteny map indicates that an expansive
genomic region containing akirin2 duplicated in a common ancestor to zebrafish and stickleback (Gasterosteus
aculeatus), since two orthologous chromosomal tracts
exist in both species that retain common synteny to a single region in tetrapod genomes (fig. 6). Specifically, tetrapod genes are present in teleosts as either single
orthologues interspersed between the two tracts (e.g.
rars2, rragd, pnrc1, rngtt, orc3l, gjb7) or are present as duplicated co-orthologues on both regions (e.g. akirin2, gabrr1,
gabbr2, znf292, syncrip) (fig. 6). A similar pattern of double
conserved synteny is seen in teleosts relative to tetrapods
on the akirin1 synteny map, although akirin1 is only

retained on a single chromosome (fig. 5). These patterns
of synteny may be the result of a genome tetraploidization
event that occurred in a basal teleost ancestor after the
split of the Actinopterygii and Sarcopterygii lineages
[13,14]. However, this interpretation requires that one of
the akirin1 paralogues from this event was non-functionalised either in a common teleost ancestor, or within individual lineages. Furthermore, one of the akirin2
paralogues must have been non-functionalised in an
ancestor to the Ostariophysi lineage, since a single akirin2
gene is found in zebrafish and fathead minnow.
Duplicated genes from teleost species are generally annotated as either gene-1/gene-2 or gene-A/gene-B according

to the order of their discovery. However, this nomenclature system is rarely based on phylogenetic premises and
generally does not accommodate paralogues from distinct
duplication events in different teleost lineages. For certain
genes where teleost duplicates have been retained from
both the teleost WGD and more recent lineage specific
events, appropriate nomenclature systems have been proposed to simplify confusing existing naming systems (e.g.
MyoD: [15]). Due to the fact that akirins are uncharacter-

ised in fishes, we have a rare opportunity to set out a logical nomenclature framework from the onset of their
study. We recommend, as indicated in fig. 1 and additional file 1, that teleost akirin2 paralogues derived from
the teleost whole-genome duplication event [13,14] are
named as either akirin2(1) or akirin2(2). Paralogues of
these genes from more recent duplication events in certain
teleost lineages e.g. salmonids [16] should be named
akirin2(1a/1b) or akirin2(2a/2b). Similarly, if new teleost

akirin1 paralogues are discovered in the future then an
equivalent naming system should be employed.
Phylogenetic analysis of gene families present on both
akirin1 and akirin2 containing chromosomal tracts
If akirin1 and akirin2 arose from the duplication of a
region of the genome in a common vertebrate ancestor
(either through a segmental duplication or tetraploidization), then other genes or gene families would have been
duplicated at this time. Several vertebrate gene families
are located in syntenic chromosomal regions where differ-

ent members are located proximally to both akirin1 and
akirin2 or to tracts where copies of these genes have been
lost (i.e. in certain regions of double conserved synteny in
teleosts, fig. 5, fig. 6 and on the region of chicken chromosome 23 shown in fig. 5). Several form small gene families, with just two members in diploid vertebrates (as
observed for the akirins) and where one member is found
on each chromosomal tract containing either akirin1 or
akirin2. For example, in several vertebrate classes, genes
for rragc, nt5c1a, cnr2, pnrc2, hnrnp-r, and maneal are
found in the akirin1 genomic neighbourhood and have a

single putative paralogue on the akirin2 chromosomal
tract (respectively: rragd, nt5c1b, cnr1, pnrc2,hnrnp-q [aka
syncrip] and manea) (compare fig. 5 and fig. 6). Comprehensive phylogenetic reconstructions of these gene families were performed with amino acid alignments using NJ,
Bayesian, ML and MP approaches (fig. 7, alignments provided in additional file 3). For 5 of these 6 gene families,
a single putative orthologue was identified in C. intestinalis/B. floridae genomes and employed as an outgroup. For
Ras-related GTP-binding protein (Rrag), Heterogeneous
nuclear ribonucleoprotein (Hnrnp), Cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase 1 (Nt5c1) and Proline-rich nuclear receptor coactivator (Pnrc) protein families, tree topologies were very
similar by all methods of reconstruction (fig. 7a–d). In
each case the tree branched into two clades containing
family member orthologues from different vertebrate
classes, closely reflecting expected taxonomic relationships (fig. 7a–d). Each of these branching topologies is
compatible with a duplication event at the base of the vertebrate lineage, as shown for akirins (fig. 3, fig. 4).

family was sensitive to the reconstruction method and
only the NJ analysis split the tree into two clades of Cnr1
and Cnr2 orthologues (fig. 7e). Other methods strongly
supported a single Cnr1 clade, but did not resolve Cnr2
sequences into a single clade, when teleost sequences were
included (not shown). However, it is noteworthy that previous phylogenetic studies have suggested that Cnr1 and
Cnr2 (also known respectively as CB1 and CB2) duplicated from a single proto-orthologue in the vertebrate
stem of the chordate lineage [17,18].
For the glycoprotein endo-alpha-1,2-mannosidase family,
all four methods of reconstruction produced similar
topologies in which the tree did not branch into separate
Manea and Maneal clades due to the inclusion of teleost
Manea sequences as the external branch of a clade containing solely other vertebrate Maneal sequences (not
shown). We tested the hypothesis that tree topology was
being influenced by mutational saturation at a proportion
of sites in the alignment. When saturated positions were
removed from the analysis, a NJ topology was obtained
splitting the tree into separate vertebrate Manea and
Maneal clades (fig. 7f). Therefore, it is possible that mutational saturation caused an aberrant branching of teleost
Manea sequences and that the corrected tree again reflects
a duplication event of a Manea/Maneal proto-orthologue
in a common vertebrate ancestor.
In most vertebrate classes, two members of the potassium
voltage-gated channel family (kcnq4 and kcnq5) were
located in the respective genomic neighbourhood of
akirin1 and akirin2 (fig. 5, fig. 6). This gene family contains up to five members in diploid vertebrates and 2

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/34

members in the C. intestinalis genome. All methods of
phylogenetic analysis produced near identical topologies
with a clade including vertebrate and C. intestinalis Kcnq1
orthologues that branched externally to remaining family
members (fig. 7g). Internal to this clade, the other C. intestinalis Kcnq sequence branched externally to the remaining four vertebrate Kcnq sequences, which split into two
well-supported clades containing Kcnq2/3 and Kcnq4/5
sequences respectively (fig. 7g). These clades split into
sub-clades containing individual Kcnq2 and 3 orthologues and Kcnq4 and 5 orthologues (fig. 7g). This
branching pattern can be explained by two duplication
events in the vertebrate lineage, where a single protoorthologue to Kcnq2/3/4/5, duplicated to create two ancestor genes to Kcnq2/3 and Kcnq4/5 which both duplicated
again to produce Kcnq2, kcnq3, kcnq4 and kcnq5 genes as
conserved in current vertebrate genomes.
The branching patterns of these gene families, are therefore generally consistent, not only with at least one duplication event in a common ancestor to mammals, birds,
frogs and fishes, but in the case of the highlighted members, often reflect their respective chromosomal proximity
to akirin1 or akirin2. In other words, when orthologues
from a gene family (i.e. one clade in the tree) were located
in the genomic neighbourhood of either akirin1 or 2, paralogues from that family (in the other clade) tended to be
proximal to, or at least on the same chromosome as the
other akirin copy. A parsimonious explanation for these
findings is that a duplication event occurred in the vertebrate stem of the chordates that affected a chromosomal
region containing both proto-orthologues to akirin and to
components of neighbouring gene families. Two-rounds
of genome polyploidisation in vertebrates has been long
been proposed [e.g. [19]] and support for this hypothesis
has been obtained by comparing vertebrate genome
organisation, with deuterostome relatives with unduplicated genomes, including urochordates [20,21] and
recently cephalochordates [10]. For example, Putnam et
al. showed that Gnathostome genomes share quadruple
conserved synteny with the Branchiostoma floridae genome
providing 'conclusive evidence for two rounds of duplication on the jawed vertebrate stem' [10]. However, this idea
has been historically controversial and certain studies
using phylogenetic analysis of vertebrate gene families
found a lack of supporting statistical evidence e.g. [22,23],
while others found results compatible with the hypothesis
e.g. [24].

akirin1 and akirin2. The corresponding amino acid alignments employed are provided in additional file 3. The shown topologies (a-g) were obtained by NJ and unless mentioned otherwise in the main text, were comparable to those produced by Bayesian, ML and MP analyses. Branch confidence values greater than 50% from each approach are shown in the order NJ/Bayesian/

coactivator family (pnrc1 and pnrc2) (d), cannabinoid receptor family (cnr1 and cnr2) (e) and glycoprotein endo-alpha-1,2-mannosidase family (manea and maneal) (f) each contained two members in all non-teleost vertebrate genomes examined and
were, with limited exceptions, present in syntenic chromosomal regions (or double conserved syntenic regions in some teleosts- see fig. 5 and fig. 6) where one family member was located near akirin1 and the other near akirin2. The potassium voltagegated channel (kcnq) family (Kcnq1/2/3/4/5) (g) contains two family members (kcnq4 and kcnq5) that are, in most vertebrates, in
genomic proximity to akirin1 and akirin2 respectively. Further details about each phylogenetic analysis are provided in the text.
To summarise, the branching patterns for each of these families was compatible with a duplication event in the vertebrate lineage of chordates and was also concomitant to their genomic location in relation to akirin1 (indicated by red branches) and
akirin2 (indicated by blue branches).

mulates changes, (either through redundancy or by positive selection) or alternatively, through the partitioning of
the functions of an unduplicated ancestor protein
[reviewed in [25]]. Whatever the mechanism, if functional
divergence has occurred between duplicated genes, then it
should be observable as changes within their coding
regions, since functionally important and non-functionally important residues should evolve under different constraints.
It is known that Akirin1 and Akirin2 differ in at least one
function [1]. The branch length leading to the Akirin1
clade is extended relative to Akirin2 in all phylogenies,
(fig. 3, fig. 4). This suggests that after the akirin duplication, Akirin1 evolved at a faster rate than Akirin2. This
result was confirmed by significant relative rate test results
for several vertebrate lineages (result not shown). To
examine whether this difference in evolutionary rate was
accompanied by altered selective constraints, we examined pairwise rates of synonymous (dS) and non-synonymous (dN) substitutions between Akirin1 and 2 for
several vertebrate lineages. Two approaches were implemented: firstly, the likelihood method of Goldman and
Yang [26] and secondly, the Nei-Gojobori approach [27].
Both results were comparable and low dN/dS ratios (<<1)
were estimated when different vertebrate lineages were
compared for Akirin1 and Akirin2 (additional file 4). Specifically, dN/dS ratios averaged from both methods, were
~0.14 for Akirin1 and ~0.09 for Akirin2. Thus, Akirin1
and Akirin2 proteins, as a whole, have evolved under
comparably strict purifying selection.
It is known from both a large-scale protein-protein interaction study [30] and specific studies [2,31,32] that the
ancestor protein to Akirin1 and Akirin2 has many binding
partners (>20 are currently known) and several of these
are conserved in equivalent vertebrate pathways (see section: 'a synthesis of information on akirin function').
Thus, there are many potential residues of functional significance in Akirin (i.e. within putative binding sites) that
may have evolved at different rates between Akirin1 and
2. Furthermore, binding sites for 14-3-3 proteins have
been biochemically confirmed in Akirin2 [2]. Statistical
methods have been proposed to predict whether functional divergence of related members of a protein family
has occurred (e.g. [28]) and identify the most likely residues involved (e.g. [28,29]). Initially, we used a likelihood ratio test (LRT) implemented in the program
DIVERGE [33] to test the hypothesis that functional divergence of Akirin1 and 2 was a reflection of a shift in evolutionary rates at certain amino acid sites between
paralogues (known as type-I divergence, [28]). The model
underlying this approach was described in [28]. To summarise, we tested whether the coefficient of functional
divergence ( ) between Akirin1 and 2 clusters in the phyl-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/34

ogenetic tree topology provided (as in fig. 3), was >0. The
LRT predicted that functional divergence had occurred
between Akirin1 and 2 ( = 0.37 +/- 0.06, statistically significant [28,33]). Next, DIVERGE was used to establish
the posterior probability of type-I divergence at each site
in the alignment (fig. 8a). Employing a cut-off posterior
probability value of 0.6, ~20 sites were predicted as the
most likely candidate sites for type-I functional divergence. For comparative purposes, the same alignment and
phylogeny was submitted to a ML LRT, which, like the
Bayesian method provides a statistical framework where
evolutionary rate shifts at particular protein positions can
be established [29]. The statistically most likely positions
predicted to underlie functional divergence were comparable by both methods, particularly for the highest-ranking candidates (fig. 8a, b). High scoring positions were
mapped onto an amino acid alignment of the Akirin gene
family, in relation to known functional motifs (fig. 9). A
PDF output of the ML analysis, in its original format, is
also provided (additional file 5).
The extreme N-terminus (first 30 residues) and C-terminus (last ~70 residues) of Akirin proteins are clearly under
strong purifying selection based on the near absence of
fast-evolving sites (additional file 5) and the presence of
many sites that have evolved at a significantly slower rate
than the average of all positions (fig. 9, additional file 5).
Further, in these N and C-terminal regions, very few sites
(respectively none and two) are predicted to contribute to
functional divergence between Akirin1 and 2 (fig. 8, fig.
9). Of the last 65 sites in Akirins, 20% are conserved from
basal metazoans to vertebrates and ~55% code for isofunctional replacements (not shown). Additionally, it is
only the ~70 most C-terminal residues that share significant identify with the basal Amoebozoan and protist
orthologues (not shown). Therefore these conserved
regions must perform essential functions common to Akirins and are obvious candidates for experimental characterisation.
A known functional motif found in Akirins, is a highly
conserved N-terminal NLS [1] (fig. 9). As expected, sites
within this motif have evolved significantly slower than
the average in all Akirins (fig. 9, additional file 5), in support of its necessity for nuclear localisation as demonstrated in insect and mammalian Akirins [1]. Further,
another NLS was predicted in PSORT2 [34] to be present
in Akirin of invertebrate deuterostomes (plus several
other invertebrates, dating back to Placozoans, not
shown) and Akirin2, but not Akirin1 (fig. 9). However,
rate shifts at these sites were not predicted to contribute to
functional divergence between paralogues. Interestingly,
Akirin1 was detected in both the nucleus and cytoplasm
of C2C12 myoblasts [3]. Further experimental tests will be
needed to examine whether this second NLS augments the

binding site conserved in both Akirin1 and Akirin2 (sites
111 and 113–114). It is feasible that these sites have contributed to altered 14-3-3 binding properties of Akirin1
and 2. Another region that is a strong candidate for type-I
divergence between Akirin1 and Akirin2 is found at sites
58–67. In this region, 5/10 positions have evolved at a significantly slower rate in Akirin2 than Akirin1 (fig. 8) and
are among the highest scoring candidate residues for typeI functional divergence (fig. 9). This region may be a binding site that is functional in the invertebrate Akirins and
Akirin2, but not in Akirin1.
Putative 14-3-3 binding sites in Akirins
Of the five 14-3-3 protein-binding sites identified in rat
Akirin2 [2], four are conserved across amniote orthologues (not shown), and fewer in teleost orthologues (fig.
9). Akirin1 has between one and four putative 14-3-3
binding sites across a broad phylogenetic range of vertebrates, generally in regions conserved with at least one
Akirin2 protein. Deuterostome invertebrate Akirins generally have two to four 14-3-3 binding sites, usually in
regions aligning with vertebrate Akirins, but rarely with
other invertebrate Akirins (fig. 9). The M. brevicollis, D. discoideum and N. gruberi orthologues have a single putative
14-3-3 binding site whereas G. theta has none (not
shown). Therefore, the number of potential 14-3-3 binding sites in Akirin proteins increased rapidly at the base of
metazoan evolution. However, sites are absent or greatly
reduced in certain metazoan lineages, including D. melanogaster (0 sites), Anopheles gambiae (0 sites), Lumbricus
rubellus (0 sites) and Caenorhabditis elegans (1 site) (not
shown). The preferred binding motifs of 14-3-3 proteins
are Arg-Ser-x-Ser-x-Pro and Arg-x-x-x-Ser-x-Pro, although
functional variations in these motifs are tolerated [35].
Almost invariably, sites in Akirin proteins have the consensus-binding site Ser/Thr-x-Pro or Ser-x-Ser/Thr-x-Pro
(fig. 9). The single exception is the sea squirt sequence,
which has a perfect site (Arg-Ser-Pro-Pro-Ser-Ser-Pro) (fig.
9). Unsurprisingly, multiple sites were needed for the formation of the Akirin2–14-3-3 complex [2]. Considering
the variability in the number (sometimes none) and physical locations of 14-3-3 sites, it is likely that the binding
affinity for 14-3-3 proteins will vary considerably between
Akirin1 and Akirin2 paralogues within vertebrate species
and between orthologues from different lineages.
A synthesis of information on akirin function
In this section, we combine the findings of this study with
available literature on the known roles of akirin genes in
order to provide novel insight into their biochemical
functions. We hope that this will prompt the sharing of
akirin literature between researchers from different fields
and open up new avenues of investigation.

Consistent with the embryonic lethal knockdown of akirin and akirin2 in flies and mice respectively [1], the abla-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/34

tion of akirin in the embryos of the nematode C. elegans by
RNAi knockdown was also lethal (http://www.worm
base.org/ search term: E01A2.6). Further, RNAi knockdown of akirin in ticks (i.e. subolesin, previously named
'protective antigen 4D8',[36]) dramatically affected the
growth and fertility phenotype, with enormous associated
reductions in survival, weight and oviposition, as well as
developmental abnormalities in several different tissues
[37]. These findings support the idea that akirin is an
essential developmental gene across a broad phylogenetic
range of metazoans. Another conserved feature of Akirins
in metazoans is their nuclear localisation (fly: [1] and Flybase: http://flybase.bio.indiana.edu/; mammals: [1-3]
and broad or near-ubiquitous expression patterns in
embryonic and adult tissues (fly: [1], nematodes: http://
www.wormbase.org/, search term: E01A2.6; ticks: [36];
zebrafish: [38]; mammals: [1,2]. These basic comparisons
indicate that akirins function in a wide range of processes,
through direct or indirect regulation of gene transcription,
consistent with current literature [1-3,31].
In vertebrates, akirin1 is not essential for embryonic development, and has even been lost in the class Aves. Thus,
relative to Akirin and Akirin2, Akirin1 has diverged in at
least one essential function (i.e. in innate immunity,
although other functions of Akirin1 in this system could
be masked by functional redundancy [1]). This is supported by significantly faster rates of evolution in multiple
sites of Akirin1 compared to its paralogue (fig. 7, fig. 8).
However, there were also several sites that have evolved
faster in Akirin2 than Akirin1, and could represent regions
where a function has been conserved in Akirin1 but was
lost in Akirin2. It is known that akirin1 (aka mighty) has a
role in regulating vertebrate myogenesis, as it was identified in mice from a suppression subtraction hybridization
cDNA library produced using myostatin-null mice as the
'tester' material [3]. Myostatin (aka GDF-8) is a potent
negative regulator of mammalian myogenesis and mice
lacking a functional copy have a double-muscled phenotype [39]. akirin1 was reportedly upregulated in the muscles of myostatin-/- mice [3]. Mstn protein was also shown
to inhibit the transcription of the akirin1 proximal promoter [3]. Interestingly, akirin1 also functions in myogenesis in flies. Specifically, Akirin (as Bhringi) bound the
bHLH factor Twist and this interaction was necessary for
the normal expression of Twist target proteins [32], representing another example of Akirins as co-regulators of
transcription. Fly mutants lacking akirin had considerable
defects in muscle mass and morphology [32]. This is a
strikingly opposite phenotype to that induced by the overexpression of akirin1 in mdx mice, where muscle mass,
fibre size and structural integrity was markedly increased
[3]. Thus, the role of mammalian akirin1 in regulating
muscle growth may be conserved from the akirin protoorthologue. If the function of akirin1 in amniote muscle
growth is essential, then its absence in birds, where musPage 14 of 20

cle physiology is strongly conserved with mammals, particularly in terms of the functions of key genes (e.g.
myostatin), could only be fulfilled by akirin2.
akirin2 (as FBI1) was also shown to promote carcinogenesis by interacting with the phosphoserine-threoninebinding protein 14-3-3β [2]. 14-3-3 proteins are highly
conserved in eukaryotes and regulate many cellular activities including the cell cycle, intracellular signalling, apoptosis and malignant transformation (reviewed by
[35,40]). The 14-3-3β isoform had previously been shown
to regulate tumour formation and was upregulated in several cancer cell lines [41] acting through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway [42]. akirin2 was
also upregulated in tumour cell lines and its mRNA downregulation reduced tumour metastasis by inducing the
expression of MAP kinase phosphotase 1 (MKP1), which
reduced the activation of the extracellular-signal regulated
kinases (ERKs), ERK1 and ERK2 [2]. Specifically, the
akirin2-14-3-3β complex functioned as a transcriptional
repressor of the MKP-1 promoter [2]. Based solely on the
presence of a comparable repertoire of 14-3-3 proteinbinding sites, redundancy of this carcinogenic-promoting
function with akirin1 cannot be excluded. However, distinct evolutionary rates in positions within, or adjacent to
14-3-3 binding sites in Akirin1 and Akirin2 are probably
important explanatory variables underlying their functional divergence (fig. 9). Interestingly, there also exists
evidence to suggest that akirin1, like akirin2, indeedfunctions as part of the ERK signalling pathway. It is established that the inhibitory effect of Myostatin on
myogenesis is mediated through activation of components of the MAPK/ERK signalling pathway [3,43,44].
akirin1 transcription was inhibited by treatment with
Myostatin protein and conversely was upregulated by
chemical inhibition of MEK1/ERK signalling [3]. Thus, it
was suggested that Myostatin signals to akirin1 through
ERK signalling [3].
In vertebrate immune response signalling pathways,
akirin2 functions at a level close to, or downstream of NFκB to selectively regulate some of its target genes [1]. Since
a direct interaction of fly Akirin and NF-κB was not demonstrated, it was suggested that Akirins interact with intermediary components [1]. 14-3-3 proteins are potential
candidates, since they are known to regulate the nuclear
localisation of transcription factors, are found in many
transcriptional complexes, can bind to histones and can
regulate histone acetylation [35,40]. Importantly, a 14-33-Akirin2 complex bound to and regulated promoter
activity [2]. 14-3-3 proteins regulate NF-κB activity by
binding both IκB and the p65 subunit of NF-kB [45]. IκB
is known to inhibit NF-kB by sequestering p65 in the cytoplasm [46] and further, the IκBα isoform also facilitates its
nuclear export [47]. TNFα treatment induced the nuclear

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/34

localisation of 14-3-3 proteins and the disruption of 14-33-protein function caused the nuclear localisation of both
IκB and p65 [45]. Furthermore, following TNFα treatment, both IκB and 14-3-3β/γ proteins bound to the promoter regions of IL-6 and RANTES, presumably
disrupting the interaction of p65 and chromatin [45]. It
was suggested that 14-3-3 proteins formed a complex with
IκB and p65 that was efficiently exported from the nucleus
[45]. Interestingly, these same NF-KB transcriptional targets (IL-6, RANTES) were strongly repressed in akirin2
knockout mice following TLR, IL-1β and TNFα treatment
[1]. Therefore, an interesting line of investigation will be
to examine whether the transcriptional repression of NFkB targets in akirin2 knockout mice is accounted for by
altered 14-3-3-protein activity. In addition to a predicted
interaction with 14-3-3 proteins to regulate chromatin, fly
Akirin (as Bhringi) was shown to bind Bap60 [30], a DNA
binding protein that forms part of the SWI/SNF-like chromatin remodelling complex [48] which is highly conserved in eukaryotes. Akirin also interacts with the GATAtranscriptional activator Pannier [49] and with TDP45
[30], (TAR DNA binding protein 43), a highly conserved
RNA binding protein with roles in transcriptional repression [50] and in regulating exon skipping [51]. It is also
noteworthy, that fly Akirin physically interacts with
CG1473 [30], a protein with high homology to a E2 Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. The ubiquitin-conjugating
enzyme UBC13 forms part of the ubiquitin-conjugating
complex important in the activation of IKK (and thus activation of NF-κB transcriptional activity) through TRAF6
[52]. CG1473, like Akirin, also binds to the chromatin
remodelling protein Bap60 [30], indicating a wider protein-interaction network.
14-3-3 proteins are also known to regulate insulin-like
growth factor signalling, a pathway activated by Akirin1
overexpression [3]. The 14-3-3ε isoform binds to phosphorylated forms of both the IGF-I receptor (IGF-I R) and
the insulin receptor substrate-I (IRS-I) [53] while the 143-3β-isoform binds to activated IRS-I reducing its ability
to activate PI(3) kinase (PI(3)K) [54]. During myogenesis,
a feed-forward cascade occurs, where IGF-II secreted during early myoblast differentiation, binds to and activates
the IGF-IR, in turn activating IRS-1, and the PI(3)k-Akt
phosphorylation pathway, which then promotes efficient
transcriptional activation of muscle differentiation genes
through a MyoD-E-protein complex and several known
co-factors [55]. In myoblasts overexpressing Akirin1, differentiation was accelerated, with a concurrent increase in
MyoD, Myogenin and IGF-II protein expression, activated
Akt expression and a massive increase in the transcription
of IGF-II mRNA [3]. These results suggest that Akirin1 can
stimulate IGF-II-PI(3)K-Akt signalling, culminating in the
transcription of muscle differentiation genes. Akirin1 has
several low affinity 14-3-3 binding sites (fig. 8) and was

detected in the cytoplasm [3]. It is therefore possible that
the positive effect of Akirin1 on the IGF-II signalling pathway is mediated through binding 14-3-3 proteins in the
cytoplasm, sequestering them and effectively stimulating
the activation of the IGF1-R and IRS-1 and downstream
components of the pathway.

Conclusion
In summary, the akirin gene family is clearly essential to
many physiological functions in metazoans and operates
in several characterised signalling pathways. This paper
provides a necessary evolutionary scaffold to guide future
investigations of eukaryote akirins. Our exhaustive
genomic screens, coupled with the implementation of a
common akirin nomenclature, should aid researchers in
identifying new functions of akirins and encourage the
propagation of existing research between disciplines.
Molecular evolution analyses indicate that vertebrate
Akirin1 and Akirin2 proteins have diverged in function
and we provide a list of potential underlying candidate
residues. An interesting line of future investigation will be
to further examine the role played by Akirin-14-3-3 protein interactions in regulating gene expression and signalling cascades in innate immune, myogenic and
carcinogenic pathways.

(Aedes aegypti, A.gambiae and D.melanogaster), nematodes
(C. elegans) and Fungi (Saccharomyces cerevisiae).

To identify akirin1/akirin2 orthologues in a broader range
of metazoans, directed tBLASTn searches of NCBI nucleotide and EST databases were performed for the following
taxa: Acoelomorpha, Annelida, Arthropoda, Brachiopoda,
Bryozoa, Chaeognatha, Chordata (classes: Ascidiacea,
Aves, Cephalaspidomorphi, Cephalochordata and
Myxini), Cnidaria, Ctenophora, Echinodermata, Entoprocta, Hemichordata, Mollusca, Nematoda, Nematomorpha,
Nemertea,
Onychophora,
Placozoa,
Platyhelminthes, Porifera, Rotifera, Tardigrada and Xenoturbellida. Non-metazoan eukaryotes were also screened
by the same approach, including the following taxa:

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/34

Amoebozoa, Choanoflagellata, Chromalveolata, Fungi,
and Plantae. Finally, genome databases at the DOE Joint
Genome Institute http://www.jgi.doe.gov/, Welcome
Trust Sanger Institute http://www.sanger.ac.uk/, Arabidopsis Genome Initiative http://www.arabidopsis.org/
and TIGR Rice Genome Annotation http://www.tigr.org/
tdb/e2k1/osa1/index.shtml were BLAST screened for akirin orthologues for the following taxa: Amoebozoa (D.
discoideum, Entamoeba histolytica), Archea (Methanococcoides burtonii, Sulfolobus islandicus), Bacteria (Mycobacterium sp., Enterobacter sp. Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus
aureus), Choanozoa (Monosiga brevicollis), Chromalveolata (Emiliania huxleyi, Thalassiosira pseudonana, Aureococcus anophagefferens), Excavata (N. gruberi, Trypanosoma
brucei, Trichomonas vaginalis, Giardia lamblia), Fungi
(Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans), Placozoa (T. adhaerens) and Plantae (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Selaginella
moellendorffii, Sorghum bicolour, Oryza sativa).
Comparative analyses of genomic and coding regions
Synteny maps for the genomic neighbourhoods surrounding akirin1 and akirin2 were constructed using data
manually obtained from release 50–52 Ensembl genome
assemblies for H. sapiens, M. musculus, G. gallus, X. tropicalis, D. rerio and G. aculeatus. The genomic neighbourhoods
surrounding H. sapiens akirin1/akirin2 were used as a starting reference. The intron-exon organisation of eukaryotic
akirin orthologues was established by loading genomic
and corresponding cDNA sequences into Spidey [56].
PSORTII [34] was used to predict NLSs.
Phylogenetic analysis of the Akirin gene family
27 full coding amino acid sequences of Akirin were used
for phylogenetic analysis. This included Akirin1/Akirin2
sequences spanning broad vertebrate taxa as well as deuterostome outgroups representing the single invertebrate
gene related to both vertebrate akirin1/akirin2 in Urochordates (H. roretzi), Cephalochordates (B. floridae), Hemichordates (Saccoglossus kowalevskii) and Echinoderms
(Strongylocentrotus purpuratus). Sequence alignment was
performed using PROMALS [57] at http://pro
data.swmed.edu/promals/. The first output was improved
by removing indels and low scoring regions of the alignment as well as manual checking of alignment quality. ML
was performed using PhyML [58] at http://atgc.lirmm.fr/
phyml/. The JTT substitution model was utilised with concurrent estimation of the gamma distribution parameter.
1000 bootstrap replicates were sampled to obtain a measure of branch confidence. The Bayesian approach was
implemented in MrBayes3.12 [59] with estimation of the
substitution rate model, and gamma distribution of
among site rate variation. 2 runs were used, each with a
single chain of 20 million generations, sampled every
10,000 generations. Convergence was assessed by comparing the standard deviation of split frequencies between

runs. 1000 trees were excluded from a total sample of
2001 trees in each run. The independence of the remaining samples was then assessed by analysing autocorrelation in tree log-likelihood values implemented using the
ACF function of Minitab 13.2 (Minitab, Inc.). Sample
independence was confirmed as no significant increase in
log-likelihoods was observed after the burnin phase.
Additionally, NJ, ME and MP analyses were performed in
Mega 4.0 [60], in each case obtaining branch confidence
values by bootstrapping with 1000 iterations. For NJ and
ME analyses, the JTT model was used with a gamma distribution parameter estimated by PhyML (α = 0.91). Finally,
ASATURA was used to remove saturated amino acid positions from the alignment prior to NJ tree reconstruction
[11] using the JTT model.
Phylogenetic analysis of vertebrate gene families proximal
to akirin1 and akirin2
Phylogenetic analysis was performed on seven vertebrate
gene families, where members were represented on both
akirin1 and akirin2 containing chromosomal tracts in at
least two vertebrate classes (further details are provided in
the results and fig. 7). High quality amino-acid translations were obtained from Ensembl release 52 genome
databases for representatives of four vertebrate taxa
(mammalia, aves, amphibia and Actinopterygii). Outgroup sequences were obtained either through orthologue
screening of Ensembl databases for C. intestinalis, or non
chordate invertebrates, or by BLAST screening of NCBI C.
intestinalis or B. floridae protein databases. Sequence alignment was performed with Promals [57] followed by manual checking and submission to Gblocks at http://
molevol.cmima.csic.es/castresana/Gblocks_server.html
to remove poorly aligned and divergent regions [61].
Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction was performed as
for the Akirins, except with different sampling parameters
for each gene family. Briefly, 5 million generations were
performed with sampling every 2500 generations for the
ras-related GTP-binding, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein, cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase 1, proline-rich
nuclear receptor coactivator, glycoprotein endo-alpha1,2-mannosidase families. For the cannabinoid receptor
and potassium voltage-gated channel families, 10 million
generations were performed with sampling every 5000
generations. In each analysis, runs had converged (i.e. the
standard deviation of split frequencies between runs was
<0.005) before half of the final number of generations
were reached. 1000 trees were excluded from a total sample of 2001 trees in each run before consensus phylogenies were reconstructed. ML, NJ and MP analysis were
performed essentially as described for the Akirin dataset.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/34

codon-alignments obtained by loading aligned amino
acid and corresponding nucleotide sequences into
PAL2NAL [62]. Akirin1 orthologues from H. sapiens, M.
musculus, X. tropicalis and D. rerio were compared. Akirin2
orthologues from H. sapiens, M. musculus, G. gallus, X. tropicalis and D. rerio were compared. PAL2NAL was set to
automatically calculate synonymous and non-synonymous substitution rates, for each pairwise comparison
using a model [26] normally implemented in codeml of
PAML [63]. Additionally, two codon alignments were produced separately for the Akirin1 and 2 orthologues
described above and loaded into Mega 4.0 [60]. Pairwise
estimates of the number of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions between different orthologues were
then calculated using the Nei-Gojobori method [27], with
the P-distance model.
To examine potential shifts in evolutionary rates between
Akirin paralogues, an amino acid alignment with 14
Akirin2 orthologues, 9 Akirin1 orthologues and 4 Akirin
orthologues from invertebrate deuterostomes (additional
file 2) was loaded into DIVERGE [33] with a corresponding phylogenetic tree in Newick format, that had the
topology obtained by ML (fig. 3). The Akirin1 and Akirin2
clades were defined as separate clusters and the coefficient
of functional divergence and posterior probability for
functional divergence at each site in the alignment were
estimated using the Gu99 algorithm [28]. Additionally,
the same alignment was loaded into the rate shift analysis
server at http://www.daimi.au.dk/~compbio/rateshift/
[29] along with the same Newick file. Akirin1, Akirin2
and Akirin (outgroup) clusters were defined and the JTT
model was employed.
