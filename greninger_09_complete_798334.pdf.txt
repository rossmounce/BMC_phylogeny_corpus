Abstract
Background: Diarrhea kills 2 million children worldwide each year, yet an etiological agent is not
found in approximately 30–50% of cases. Picornaviral genera such as enterovirus, kobuvirus,
cosavirus, parechovirus, hepatovirus, teschovirus, and cardiovirus have all been found in human and
animal diarrhea. Modern technologies, especially deep sequencing, allow rapid, high-throughput
screening of clinical samples such as stool for new infectious agents associated with human disease.
Results: A pool of 141 pediatric gastroenteritis samples that were previously found to be negative
for known diarrheal viruses was subjected to pyrosequencing. From a total of 937,935 sequence
reads, a collection of 849 reads distantly related to Aichi virus were assembled and found to
comprise 75% of a novel picornavirus genome. The complete genome was subsequently cloned and
found to share 52.3% nucleotide pairwise identity and 38.9% amino acid identity to Aichi virus. The
low level of sequence identity suggests a novel picornavirus genus which we have designated
klassevirus. Blinded screening of 751 stool specimens from both symptomatic and asymptomatic
individuals revealed a second positive case of klassevirus infection, which was subsequently found
to be from the index case's 11-month old twin.
Conclusion: We report the discovery of human klassevirus 1, a member of a novel picornavirus
genus, in stool from two infants from Northern California. Further characterization and
epidemiological studies will be required to establish whether klasseviruses are significant causes of
human infection.

Background
Picornaviruses are positive-sense ssRNA viruses consisting
of eight classical genera and six new proposed genera.
They share a common genomic organization with a long

5' untranslated region (UTR) (500–800 nt) containing an
internal ribosome entry site (IRES), a single ORF encoding
a polyprotein that is proteolytically processed, and a short
3' UTR followed by a polyA tail [1]. Major differences

among picornaviruses, among others, include the secondary structure of the 5' UTR and IRES and a VP0 capsid protein that is either cleaved into VP4 and VP2 or remains
intact.
Kobuvirus is a genus in the family Picornavirus. There are
three known kobuviruses: Aichi virus, bovine kobuvirus,
and porcine kobuvirus [2-4]. All three have been discovered in stool specimens, with Aichi virus associated with
non-bacterial human gastroenteritis, typically associated
with oyster consumption [5]. Though originally isolated
in Japan, Aichi virus has been found over a broad geographical range covering Asia, the Americas, and Europe
[5,6]. All kobuviruses share the typical picornavirus
genomic organization with genome sizes ranging from
8210–8374 nt. In addition to having a uncleaved VP0 capsid protein, kobuviruses have 3 highly conserved stemloop structures in the first 120 nt of their 5' UTR which
have been shown to be required for viral replication and
encapsidation in Aichi virus [7,8].
Recently, pyrosequencing of stool samples from patients
with acute flaccid paralysis from Pakistan was recently
used to identify cosavirus, a new proposed picornaviral
genus [9]. In this study, we report the discovery of a novel
human picornavirus genus in two twins through pyrosequencing. We also report whole genome recovery and initial PCR screening for the novel picornavirus.

Results
Pyrosequencing of genome of novel picornavirus genus
As part of an ongoing investigation of pediatric gastroenteritis from Northern California, we identified 141 stool
samples that were negative for viral detection by specific
PCR for 7 stool viruses (adenovirus, astrovirus, calicivirus,
rotavirus, enterovirus, cardiovirus, parechovirus) and
Virochip, a pan-viral microarray. 141 samples were negative by array and PCR and were subjected to two sequencing runs on a Genome Sequencer FLX without molecular
bar-coding. The two sequencing runs gave 937,935 filter
pass reads with an average length of 241.7 bp, ranging
from 32–503 bp. Of these, 849 reads had an E-value of
less than 1e-6 against the Aichi virus genome by TBLASTX.
Reads that aligned to Aichi virus assembled into approximately 75% of an expected ~8 kb genome (Figure 1). To
identify the origin of the Aichi virus-like reads, reads were
used to design primers [454A1F/454A2R, see Additional
file 1] to screen amplified cDNA libraries of the original
141 samples. One sample (02394-01) was found to be
positive with a 342 bp amplicon that matched the
sequence recovered by pyrosequencing.

Given gaps in sequencing coverage and small picornavirus
genome size, the pyrosequencing reads were used to
design primers for subsequent amplification of the

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/82

genome from sample 02394-01 total RNA [see Additional
file 1]. RT-PCR was used to generate overlapping amplicons, which were cloned and subjected to Sanger sequencing. The 3' end of the genome was recovered by 3' RACE,
while the 5' end of the genome was recovered by multiple
iterations of 5' RACE using MLV and TTH reverse transcriptase from the most 5' pyrosequencing read that
aligned to Aichi virus, approximately 250 nucleotides
from the 5' end of the genome.
Genome of novel picornavirus
The complete genome of the novel picornavirus is 7989
nt, excluding the poly-A tail [GenBank GQ184145]. A
large ORF of 7113 nucleotides, encoding a 2371 amino
acid potential polyprotein precursor, is flanked by a 5'
UTR of 718 nt and a 3'UTR of 158 nt and poly(A) tail. The
base composition of the coding region is 17.8% A, 36.0%
C, 20.7% G, and 25.5% U. The genome shares 52.3%,
49.9%, and 49.8% pairwise nucleotide identity with Aichi
virus, bovine kobuvirus, and porcine kobuvirus (Figure
1). The P1, P2, and P3 coding region has 38.0%, 34.8%,
and 43.3% pairwise amino acid identity versus Aichi
virus, suggesting it qualifies as a new picornavirus genus.
We are provisionally naming this viral genus Klassevirus
for kobu-like viruses associated with stool and sewage.
5' UTR
The 5' UTR of human klassevirus 1 is approximately the
same length as that of Aichi virus (718 vs 745 nucleotides,
respectively). The latter two-thirds of the UTR comprising
the IRES aligns with 68% identity to Aichi virus, the highest identity of any area of the genome. However, the first
250 nucleotides of human klassevirus 1 have only 52%
pairwise identity to Aichi virus and do not align to any
sequence in GenBank. The first 120 nucleotides of Aichi
virus comprising stem-loops A, B, and C (SL-A/B/C) have
been shown to be critical for viral replication and encapsidation and the first 50 nucleotides of all previously identified kobuvirus genomes are very highly conserved.

To rule out aberrant or chimeric amplification products
during the recovery of the 5' UTR, RNAse protection was
used to demonstrate that the initial 250 nt of the 5' UTR
is on the same strand as the subsequent 500 nt that aligns
to Aichi virus (Figure 2). Secondary structure analysis of
the first 140 nt of human klassevirus 1 demonstrated
some structural homology to Aichi virus 5' UTR secondary
structure. Specifically, several stem-loop and pseudoknot
structures are apparent in the first 100 bp, and no enterovirus/rhinovirus-like cloverleaf structures are recognized.
However, no SL-A structure was found and the sequence
context of the SL-B and SL-C structures are divergent with
respect to Aichi virus (Figure 2).

identity with highly conserved kobuvirus sequence that is

were unsuccessful.

Alignment of klassevirus and kobuvirus 5' UTRs
Alignment of klassevirus and kobuvirus 5' UTRs. The latter 500 bp of klasssevirus 5' UTR aligns with 69% identity to

increasing sequence identity toward the 5' end of the genome is suggestive that the 5' end may not be complete.

initiation codons at nt 719/722 which are preceded by a
12 nt polypyrimidine tract, with only a 4 nt spacer. The
pyrimidine content in this area of the genome was greater
than that of Aichi virus or bovine kobuvirus and the
spacer region was noticeably shorter than that of other
kobuviruses.
Coding region
The L protein is remarkably short at 111 aa, compared to
170 aa in Aichi virus. Two L protein motifs that have been
suggested to be conserved among kobuviruses (PEDxLxDS and LPG) were not present in klassevirus. The 2A
protein does not include any H-box/NC protein domains
as is apparent in all other kobuviruses as well as some
other picornaviruses and does not tblastx with significant
similarity to any known sequence [11].

The highest level of sequence identity in the coding region
to other picornaviruses (Aichi virus) was found in the 2C,
3D, and VP3 genes. Cleavage sites 2A-2B, 2B-2C, 2C-3A,
3A-3B, 3B-3C, and 3C-3D were all Q-G except 3C-3D
which was Q-S. The most conserved region between klassevirus and Aichi virus was in the putative nucleotide

binding domain of the 2C helicase (VVYLYGPPGTGKSLLASLLA). A conserved tyrosine was identified in the third
position of the 3B-VPg. The conserved 3C protease active
site motif that is GXCGG in the enterovirus genus was
present but changed to GLCGS, the same as in Aichi virus.
The conserved KDELR, YGDD, and FLKR motifs were
present in the 3D polymerase [4]. No tandem repeats and
no recombination with other picornaviruses were
detected in klassevirus.
PCR screening
Previously described universal kobuvirus primers failed to
detect klassevirus in our collection of 751 stool samples
(data not shown). New 32-fold degenerate pan-kobuvirus/klassevirus primers were designed to amplify a 200 bp
amplicon from the 3D gene and used for RT-PCR screening of 751 stool specimens from symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals from Northern California under code.
One additional human klassevirus 1 was detected with
screening (2/751, 0.2%). After screening, samples origins
were decoded. As it happens, the positive sample was collected from a member of the family that yielded the original sample from which klassevirus was identified. Both

children were 11-month old males. Sequence recovered
from the 3D gene and 5' UTR was >99% identical between
the two samples. No additional kobuviruses or picornaviruses were recovered from the PCR screening using these
primers, so it is not known whether these primers are, in
fact, pan-kobuvirus/klassevirus primers. The Virochip
(v4), a pan-viral microarray designed to detect all known
viruses as well as novel viruses on the basis of sequence
homology, was unable to detect the novel picornavirus
genus. Quantitative PCR from samples 02394-01 and
02394-03 indicated that approximately 5 × 107 and 1 ×
107 viral genomic copies were present per 1 mL of stool,
respectively.

this strain qualifies for designation as a new picornavirus
genus, as per ICTV standards [12].

Discussion

Similar to cosavirus, this virus was identified through
deep sequencing of stool, a strategy to identify novel
viruses that are too divergent to be identified by other
methods. Without filtering or selecting for viral particles,
we were able to obtain sequence for 75% of the klassevirus genome based on TBLASTX against Aichi virus. Aligning all the pyrosequencing reads to the complete
recovered genome of klassevirus indicated that 95% of the
viral genome could be identified from the deep sequencing run (Figure 1). This indicates that deep sequencing is
a feasible strategy for rapidly identifying entire genomes
of novel viruses.

This study presents the discovery and characterization of a
novel picornavirus, human klassevirus 1. Klassevirus has
a typical picornavirus organization with a ~700–800 bp 5'
UTR, long open reading frame and, ~100 bp 3' UTR. The
phylogenetic relationship of the new genus to other picornaviruses by amino amino acid sequence is shown in Figure 4. Given that the klassevirus genome possesses <40%
amino acid identity in the P1 and P2 regions and <50%
amino acid in the P3 region to the nearest picornavirus,

Unlike previously identified kobuviruses, the first 140 nt
of human klassevirus 1 is highly divergent. Published
studies of Aichi virus suggests the first three stem-loop
structures are required for positive and negative strand
replication as well as encapsidation [7,8]. The three
known kobuviruses share a very high degree of homology
in the first 50 bp and all have the three stem-loop structures with pseudoknot originally described in Aichi virus

[4]. Multiple attempts were made using 5' RACE to detect
the conserved elements at the 5' end of known kobuvirus
genomes and all failed. Similar sequence was recovered
from both cases of human klassevirus 1 infection and
RNAse protection demonstrated that the divergent 5' UTR
sequence was part of the klassevirus genome and not an
artifact of PCR amplification. We cannot rule out the existence of further 5' nucleotides beyond our current 5' end.

UTR as well as determine cleavage sites of the polyprotein.
Further epidemiological screening and serological assays
will be necessary to understand the diversity within this
possible genus, the prevalence of klassevirus, and the average age of those infected. Notably, both of the cases in this
study were 11 months old, which is approximately the age
at which maternal antibodies decline.

Conclusion
Despite the sequence divergence at the 5' end of its
genome compared to known kobuviruses, human klassevirus 1 contains two stem-loops and a pseudoknot structure within the first 140 bp of its genome. Human
klassevirus 1 also shares a high degree of sequence identity
with Aichi virus throughout the remainder of the 5' UTR,
indicating that IRES structure and function is likely preserved between the two viruses. This is especially interesting when compared to porcine kobuvirus which shares
the conserved first 50 bp to the kobuvirus 5' UTR but has
a hepacivirus/pestivirus-like type IV IRES [4]. Though the
exact secondary structure of the Aichi virus and bovine
kobuvirus IRES are not known, it has been suggested that
they contain type II IRES based on the position of the initial start codon of the polyprotein relative to the upstream
polypyrimidine tract [2,10]. The sequence of human klassevirus 1 3' UTR demonstrated almost no homology to
other kobuvirus 3' UTR sequences or any other sequence
in GenBank.
Although it remains to be determined whether human
klassevirus 1 causes bona fide human infection, the data
are suggestive. Screening using a newly developed PCR
primer pair designed to amplify any klassevirus or kobuvirus found klassevirus only in two young children from
the same family. The virus was present in relatively high
copy number in both samples, suggesting that replication
occurs in the gut and that human klassevirus 1 is not
merely a passenger virus. However, both infants were
asymptomatic at the time virus was present in their stool.
The low prevalence rate is akin to that of Aichi virus,
which is a rare known cause human gastroenteritis.
Bovine and porcine kobuvirus, on the other hand, have
both been found in healthy stool and bovine kobuvirus
has been found in the serum of infected cattle [13]. It
remains to be determined whether klasseviruses are
present in other human tissues or animal hosts.
Future studies to determine a possible link to disease in
humans and any unique characteristics of the viral life
cycle will be required. Viral culture on human cell lines,
especially those from the gastrointestinal tract, could be
suggestive that the virus is competent to replicate in
human cells and that humans could be a bona fide host of
klassevirus. Culture would also help elucidate the importance of different secondary structures in the divergent 5'

We have detected a new picornavirus genus in stool specimens from two twins and sequenced the viral genome.
Further characterization will be required to determine the
full extent to which this agent is implicated in human disease, and the spectrum of illnesses to which it may be
linked.

Methods
Cohort
The cohort has been described previously [14].
Stool specimen extraction, cDNA amplification, and RTPCR for genome recovery
Stool suspensions were created by mixing 2 mL of PBS
with stool (100–300 mg). 100 uL of stool/PBS mixtures
were further diluted in 900 uL of PBS and extracted using
the PureLink Viral RNA/DNA 96-well kit (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA). Total RNA/DNA was randomly amplified
using the round A/B protocol with 25 cycles of PCR before
454 pyrosequencing [15].

Specific RT-PCR was done with Qiagen One-Step RT-PCR
kit using 4 uL H2O, 2.5 uL 5× Buffer, 2.5 uL Q solution,
0.5 uL dNTP, 0.5 uL RT/Taq solution, 0.75 uL of F/R 10
uM primer, and 1 uL of stool total RNA. Conditions were
50C for 30 min, 95C for 15 min; 40 cycles of 95C for 30
sec, 50C for 30 sec, 72C for 1 min/kb; and final extension
at 72C for 7 min. Degenerate pan-kobuvirus primers targeting the 3D region used for screening were kvF 5'-GYT
TTG AYG CYA CCM TYC C-3' and kvR 5'-SGT GTT GAK
GAT GGA RGT SSC-3'. Primers for genome recovery are
listed in Additional file 1.
3' RACE was done with an adapter-linked oligo-dT
primer. Due to problems with secondary structure, 5'
RACE was done with a combination of a 5'RACE kit (Invitrogen) and by using the reverse transcriptase activity of
Tth polymerase (Promega) at 70C, TdT with 0.2 mM dATP
(NEB) for 10 minutes at 37C, and the same adapterlinked oligo-dT primer.
454 Pyrosequencing
A total of 141 amplified cDNA libraries that were negative
by array and PCR were cleaned via Ampure beads (Agencourt) and quantitated on the Nanodrop spectrophotometer. Aliquots of 200 ng from each sample were combined

and sequenced on the Genome Sequencer FLX (Roche)
using the Shotgun Sequencing protocol. Sequence analysis of Genome Sequencer FLX data was filtered against
human and bacterial sequences using BLAT before unbiased BLASTn and tBLASTx (W3) searches against the
BLAST nr database.
RNAse protection
Total RNA from sample 2394-03 was amplified using 40
cycles of RT-PCR with primers kv1F 5'-CCC TTT CGA CCG
CCT TAT-3' and kv761R 5'-CAG CCA ACG AAC TCG AAA
AT-3'. The 761 bp amplicon was gel purified and cloned
using TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). TOPO TA plasmid containing the 761 bp insert was sequenced to ensure
the correct sequence and insert direction. 1 ug of plasmid
was linearized with HindIII and linearly amplified for 10
minutes using MaxiScript (Ambion) kit with 825 nM
alpha-P32-UTP and 15 uM unlabeled UTP such that 80 bp
of vector sequence flanked both side of the 5' UTR insert.
The 920-bp radiolabeled probe was gel-purified on a
denaturing 4% polyacrylamide gel following the RPA III
kit (Ambion) protocol and quantified using scintillation
counting. 80,000 cpm of probe were hybridized with ~50
ng of stool total nucleic acid or aRNA and 5 ug of yeast
tRNA and digested with RNase A/T1 using the streamlined
protocol from the RPA III kit. The entire sample was run
on a denaturing 4% polyacrylamide gel and visualized
using a phosphoimager.
Quantitative PCR
In order to ascertain whether klassevirus underwent replication in the gut or was merely a passenger virus, quantitative PCR was used to determine viral titer in stool. A
134-bp amplicon was generated by RT-PCR using the
same conditions above for screening PCR using primers
kv3918F/kv4041R and used for standard curve generation
(109 – 100 copies per reaction). Quantitative PCR was performed on a Mx3005P (Stratagene) under the same RTPCR conditions listed above for screening PCR, with the
exception of Tm 50C for 45 sec, extension at 72C for 45
sec, addition of 1× Sybr Green, and addition of melt curve
analysis.
