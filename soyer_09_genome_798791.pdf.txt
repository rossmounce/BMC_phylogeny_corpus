Abstract
Background: The bacterium Salmonella enterica includes a diversity of serotypes that cause
disease in humans and different animal species. Some Salmonella serotypes show a broad host range,
some are host restricted and exclusively associated with one particular host, and some are
associated with one particular host species, but able to cause disease in other host species and are
thus considered "host adapted". Five Salmonella genome sequences, representing a broad host
range serotype (Typhimurium), two host restricted serotypes (Typhi [two genomes] and
Paratyphi) and one host adapted serotype (Choleraesuis) were used to identify core genome genes
that show evidence for recombination and positive selection.
Results: Overall, 3323 orthologous genes were identified in all 5 Salmonella genomes analyzed. Use
of four different methods to assess homologous recombination identified 270 genes that showed
evidence for recombination with at least one of these methods (false discovery rate [FDR] <10%).
After exclusion of genes with evidence for recombination, site and branch specific models identified
41 genes as showing evidence for positive selection (FDR <20%), including a number of genes with
confirmed or likely roles in virulence and ompC, a gene encoding an outer membrane protein, which
has also been found to be under positive selection in other bacteria. A total of 8, 16, 7, and 5 genes
showed evidence for positive selection in Choleraesuis, Typhi, Typhimurium, and Paratyphi branch
analyses, respectively. Sequencing and evolutionary analyses of four genes in an additional 42
isolates representing 23 serotypes confirmed branch specific positive selection and recombination
patterns.
Conclusion: Our data show that, among the four serotypes analyzed, (i) less than 10% of
Salmonella genes in the core genome show evidence for homologous recombination, (ii) a number
of Salmonella genes are under positive selection, including genes that appear to contribute to
virulence, and (iii) branch specific positive selection contributes to the evolution of host restricted
Salmonella serotypes.

Background
Salmonella is a ubiquitous human and animal pathogen.
This genus contains >2,500 recognized serotypes and is
divided into two species, Salmonella bongori and Salmonella enterica. S. enterica consists of six subspecies (i.e.,
enterica, salamae, arizonae, diarizonae, houtenae, and indica)
[1]. Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serotypes can also
be divided into subdivisions according to their host adaptation [2]. For example, Uzzau et al. [2] proposed that Salmonella serotypes can be divided into (i) host-restricted
Salmonella serotypes (i.e., serotypes exclusively associated
with one particular host, e.g., Salmonella Typhi and Paratyphi A); (ii) host-adapted Salmonella serotypes (i.e., serotypes prevalent in one particular host species, but able to
cause disease in other host species, e.g., Salmonella Choleraesuis); and (iii) unrestricted Salmonella serotypes (i.e.,
serotypes capable of causing self-limiting gastroenteritis
and, less commonly, systemic disease in a wide range of
host species, e.g., Salmonella Typhimurium).
Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) data indicate that the
last common ancestor of the human host-adapted Salmonella Typhi existed 15,000-150,000 years ago [3]. The evolution of Salmonella Typhi towards a lifestyle characterized
by systemic infection and transmission by excretion
through the gall bladder rather than luminal gut colonization [4] involved a combination of acquisition events
(e.g., acquisition of Vi capsule related genes), and deletion
events (e.g., loss of virulence-associated genes, such as several genes in SPI-1, SPI-2, SPI-3, SPI-4 and SPI-5). Salmonella Paratyphi A also causes typhoid fever, although the
symptoms are typically milder than those caused by Salmonella Typhi. While Salmonella Paratyphi A also appears
to have evolved recently, Salmonella Typhi and Paratyphi
A clearly show distinct differences in their genome evolution, including a number of unique gene inactivation
events in these two serotypes [5]. Non-typhoidal Salmonella serotypes are responsible for gastroenteritis in
humans and other animals. These serotypes are mainly
transmitted by ingestion of food, feed, or water contaminated with infected feces [6], but can also be transmitted
by direct contact [7,8]. Disease caused by non-typhoidal
Salmonella is one of the most common bacterial foodborne diseases worldwide [9]. Salmonella Typhimurium is
one of the most common non-typhoidal Salmonella serotypes, is found worldwide, and can cause disease, predominantly self limiting gastroenteritis, in a large number
of animal species [2]. The host adapted Salmonella Choleraesuis can cause severe disease, characterized by septicemia and enterocolitis, in swine. While relatively
uncommon, this serotype can also infect humans where it
typically causes severe invasive infections, e.g., infective
aneurysm [10].
The importance of acquisition of novel (non-homologous) genes by lateral gene transfer has been clearly dem-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/264

onstrated in a number of bacteria, including a number of
bacterial pathogens [11-14]. For example, acquisition of
pathogenicity islands has played a critical role in the evolution of Salmonella [13] and other Gram-negative and
Gram-positive pathogens [15]. Gene degradation and
gene deletions also have been shown to play a critical role
in bacterial evolution, particularly when organisms with a
broad niche specificity adapt to narrow and specific ecological niches [5,16]. For example, it has been suggested
that gene degradation and gene deletion contribute to
host adaptation in both Salmonella Typhi and Salmonella
Paratyphi A [5]. Microarray technologies have also
allowed for rapid and large scale studies on gene presence/
absence in a large number of isolates, including in Salmonella [17]. In addition to gene acquisition and deletion,
positive selection and homologous recombination, play
important roles in the evolution of bacteria and bacterial
pathogens [18-21].
Genome wide studies on positive selection and homologous recombination in bacterial pathogens, including
Streptococcus spp. [20], Listeria monocytogenes [18], Campylobacter [22], E. coli [23,24], and Shigella [24] have contributed to a better understanding of the evolution of these
important pathogens. So far, no genome wide analyses of
positive selection in Salmonella have been reported. One
study [25] evaluated 410 genes present in both S. enterica
and E. coli and reported that 50% of amino acid substitutions in these genes appear to have been fixed by positive
selection in one of these species. In order to further
improve our understanding of the evolution of Salmonella, we performed full genome analyses for homologous
recombination and positive selection using the completed
and published genome sequences for five Salmonella
strains, including the host restricted Salmonella Typhi (two
strains) and Paratyphi A, the host adapted Salmonella
Choleraesuis, and the broad host range Salmonella Typhimurium. Our analyses focused on the evolution of core
genome genes (i.e., genes found in all 5 genomes) and did
not include efforts to detect genes acquired by Salmonella
through horizontal gene transfer and subsequent nonhomologous recombination (e.g., virulence gene islands),
as these types of evolutionary events have already been
well characterized [13,26,27]. Analysis of the Salmonella
serotypes included in our study here will, in particular,
provide an improved understanding in the roles of positive selection and homologous recombination in the evolution of host-adapted pathogen strains and lineages.

November 25, 2005. Updated role category information
for all genes was obtained from JCVI on October 14, 2008;
the Salmonella Typhi CT18 genome was used as reference
for role categories. While, as of August 20, 2009, 16 fully
sequenced Salmonella genomes, including the 5 genomes
used in our study, were available in GenBank (see Additional file 1), the 5 genomes used were the only fully
sequenced Salmonella genomes available when our analyses were initiated. These 5 genomes allow for evaluation
of evolutionary trends among host-restricted and host
adapted Salmonella strains as they include the serotypes
Typhi, Paratyphi A, and Choleraesuis.
Identification of orthologous genes presents in all five
Salmonella genomes analyzed
OrthoMCL [28], which has previously been used for
prokaryotic genome analyses [20,22], was used to identify
orthologous genes in the five Salmonella genomes.
Orthologs present in all five genomes were aligned using
ClustalW [29]. Multiple sequence alignments were carried
out on amino acid sequences from each orthologous
group, followed by conversion to nucleotide sequence
alignments using the PAL2NAL software [30]. This strategy was used to allow for correct alignment of diversified
regions in which multiple nucleotide substitution events
have taken place; since amino acid sequences are more
conserved than DNA sequences, they are easier to align
and the final alignments are more reliable. Alignments
containing variable sequence lengths or having low alignment scores were manually evaluated and edited, using
BioEdit software [31], as previously described [18]. For
example, alignments containing sequences with different
lengths and alignments that contained multiple indels
that caused incorrect alignments were reviewed and edited
as detailed in [18].
Detection of genes under positive selection
Positive selection can be detected by comparing the rate of
non-synonymous substitutions (dN) to the rate of synonymous substitutions (dS). While different methods exist
for detection of positive selection, PAML (Phylogenetic
Analysis by Maximum Likelihood) was used here as (i) its
use for detection of signals of positive selection in bacteria
[18,20,23,24,32,33], viruses [34], and eukaryotes [35,36]
has been well documented, (ii) it has been shown to have

a relatively good power to detect positive selection even
with as few as 5 sequences, while keeping the number of
false positives low [37], and (iii) it allows for detection of
signals of branch specific positive selection. We used two
types of tests implemented in PAML v3.15 to identify
genes with evidence for positive selection [38], as previously detailed [18]. Briefly, an overall test for positive
selection (Test Overall; TO) was carried out to identify
genes under positive selection in any or all of the branches
of a given phylogeny; this test compares the null model
M1a (nearly-neutral) to the alternative model M2a (positive selection) [37]. To identify genes that are under positive selection in specific branches of the Salmonella
phylogeny, the branch-site test2 [39] was used. The
branch-site test was specifically used to identify genes
under positive selection in the ancestral branches of (i)
the human restricted serotypes Typhi (Ty#) and Paratyphi
A (Pty#), (ii) the porcine adapted serotype Choleraesuis
(Ch#), and (iii) the unrestricted serotype Typhimurium
(Tym#) (Figure 1). Overall, 18 different phylogenetic trees
represented the phylogeny of the 3316 Salmonella orthologous genes, including one tree that represented the phylogeny of 1198 genes. Both the overall test and the branch
site tests were performed using the gene specific trees.
For each test, nested models (one null model that does
not allow for positive selection and one alternative model
that allows for positive selection) were compared using a
Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) [40]. For each model, three
replicates were generated and the maximum likelihood
values for each model were used in the LRT in order to
eliminate the runs that could not reach the global maximum likelihood score. Tests that yielded LRT values < -0.1
were re-run 10 times and the maximum values for each
model were used to calculate the LRT. Negative LRT values
(i.e., some tests yielded values ≥ - 0.1) were rounded to
zero (p-value = 1). For all branch-specific tests, one degree
of freedom was used to calculate p-values, while for the
overall test, two degrees of freedom were used to calculate
p-values. Because recombination may generate false positive results with PAML, the final analysis of positive selection was carried out only for those genes that showed no
evidence for recombination with any of the four methods
used to detect evidence of recombination.

Example1of neighbor joining tree used for positive selection
Example of neighbor joining tree used for positive
selection analysis. Gene specific trees were used for all
positive selection analysis. The tree showed here represented the phylogeny of 849 genes. Branches used for branch
specific analyses are indicated; Ch# = Choleraesuis branch
specific test; Ty# = Typhi branch specific test; Tym# = Typhimurium branch specific test; Pty# = Paratyphi A branch specific test.

Detection of genes with evidence of recombination
Recombination analyses were performed using GENECONV version 1.81 [41], Maximum χ2 [42], pairwise
homoplasy index (PHI) [43] and neighbor similarity
score (NSS) [44] to specifically detect evidence of homologous recombination among orthologous genes found in
all 5 genomes; the 3316 alignments of orthologous genes
used for these analyses thus contained one sequence from
each genome and only recombination events between
sequences present in the alignment were considered.
Except for GENECONV, the approaches used are implemented in PhiPack [43]. GENECONV and Maximum χ2
are substitution distribution methods, while NSS and Phi
are compatibility methods [45,46]. None of these tests
require that the true phylogenetic tree is known. GENECONV detects the evidence of recombination by assessing
the significance of long tracts of identical sites among
pairs of sequences in a multiple alignment of informative

sites. Maximum χ2 searches for recombination breakpoints in the alignment by comparing the number of polymorphic and non-polymorphic sites downstream and
upstream of each putative break point (in this method, all
polymorphic sites are initially considered as putative
recombination breakpoints). NSS uses pairs of informative sites to detect evidence for recombination by assessing the tendency of neighboring sites to be more
compatible than sites that are farther apart. PHI measures
the similarity between closely linked sites to assess
whether a fragment shows evidence for recombination.
GENECONV, Maximum χ2 and NSS were used here as
these methods, in a comparison of several methods (not
including PHI), were shown to perform best (high power
and low false positive rates) for sequences with divergence
around 5% - 20% [47], representing a level of divergence
expected between different Salmonella serotypes. These
methods still differ in their relative power and specificity
for detecting recombination though (e.g., depending on
sequence divergence) and multiple methods were thus
used to identify genes with evidence of recombination,
particularly to allow for exclusion of any genes that may
have evolved through recombination from subsequent
positive selection analyses, which may be affected by
recombination.
For the GENECONV analyses, the parameter g-scale was
set to 1 and inner p-values were used to identify genes with
evidence for recombination [41]. For Maximum χ2, a
fixed window size of 2/3 the number of polymorphic sites
was used, while for PHI, a window size of 50 nucleotides
was used. P-values were estimated using 10,000 permutations of the alignment for GENECONV and 1,000 permutations for NSS, Maximum χ2 and PHI.
Assessment of codon bias, nucleotide diversity and number
of informative sites
To assess the codon bias, we identified the effective
number of codons used in a gene (NC) using the program
"chips" in the EMBOSS package [48]. NC values range
from 20, where one codon is used for each amino acid, to
61, where all alternative synonymous codons are used.
Lower values of NC indicate higher codon bias in the gene,
while higher values of NC values indicate lower codon
bias. Nucleotide diversity and number of informative sites
were obtained from PhiPack outputs.
Statistical analyses
Correction for multiple testing was performed using the
procedure reported by Benjamini and Hochberg [49] as
implemented in the program Q-Value [50]. As previously
detailed by our group [18], for each p-value, the q-value
was calculated; the q-value represents the false discovery
rate [FDR], i.e., the expected proportion of false positives
among the significant tests. Corrections were performed

separately for each test to account for testing of multiple
genes. In a preliminary analysis of positive selection, all
3,316 genes were used for FDR correction. As recombination affects the tests for positive selection, the final positive selection analysis was performed using only those
3,046 genes that showed no evidence for recombination;
FDR correction for this final positive selection analysis
was thus performed with 3,046 genes. As the tests used for
positive selection are already conservative [39], a false discovery rate (FDR) cutoff of 20% was used for the positive
selection analyses [18]. For recombination analyses, an
FDR cut-off of 10% was used to compensate the fact that
no correction for multiple tests (GENECONV, NSS, Maximum χ2 and PHI) was carried out due to the high correlation among the tests [18].
Associations between JCVI role categories and number of
genes with (i) evidence of positive selection and (ii) evidence of recombination were tested using chi-square tests
(or Fisher's exact tests where appropriate). Mann-Whitney
U-tests (Wilcoxon tests) were used to determine whether
selected continuous variables (i.e., gene length, codon
bias, and nucleotide diversity) differed between a given
role categories and all other role categories. In addition,
Mann-Whitney U-tests were used to test whether the p-val-

ues of the positive selection tests for genes in a given role
category were significantly lower than the p-values among
the genes in the other role categories. All Mann-Whitney
U-tests were performed as one-sided tests. All tests were
performed in the Statistical Analysis System (SAS) 9.1
(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
Bonferroni corrections for all tests were performed based
on the number of tests performed. The cut off value for
significance was set at 0.05; Bonferroni corrected p-values
are reported unless otherwise stated. Actual p-values are
reported unless p-values were < 0.001 or < 0.0001.
Verification of positive selection and recombination
patterns in selected genes in a larger Salmonella set
For four genes (Table 2), including two genes that showed
evidence for positive selection and recombination (i.e.,
folK-2, sseC) and two genes that only showed evidence for
positive selection (i.e., STM3258, purE) in the initial
genome wide analyses, gene sequences were determined
for an additional 42 Salmonella isolates to further test positive selection and recombination patterns. The 42 Salmonella isolates were selected to reflect a diversity of human
and animal associated serotypes; specifically, the isolates
were selected to represent the 15 most common human

and animal associated serotypes in the US (as detailed in
the 2003 Salmonella Annual Report from the US Centers of
Disease Control and Prevention [51]) as well as two additional Salmonella Typhi isolates. Human and cattle isolates representing the common human and animal
associated serotypes were conveniently selected from the
strain collection available at Cornell University Food
Safety Laboratory, which include human and animal clinical isolates originally obtained from the New York State
Department of Health and the Cornell University Animal
Health Diagnostic Center, respectively. For common serotypes (e.g., Typhimurium) more isolates were included in
this set as compared to less common serotypes (e.g., Dublin) (see Additional file 2 for a listing of all isolates used).
Multiple isolates with the same serotype were selected to
represent the most common distinct Pulsed Field Gel
Electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing
(MLST) types within a given serotype.
PCR conditions and primers for folK-2, sseC, purE, and
STM3258 amplification are described in Additional file 3.
PCR products were purified using Exonuclease I (USB)
and shrimp alkaline phosphatase (USB). Purified PCR
products were sequenced using the Applied Biosystems
Automated 3730 DNA Analyzer at the Cornell University
Life Sciences Core Laboratories Center. Big Dye Terminator chemistry and AmpliTaq-FS DNA Polymerase were
used for sequencing. Alignments for positive selection and
recombination analyses, which were performed as
detailed above, were constructed using the gene sequences
for the five genomes analyzed and the gene sequences for
the additional isolates sequenced.

Results
Initial identification and characterization of orthologous
genes present in the five Salmonella genomes representing
serotypes Typhi, Typhimurium, Choleraesuis, and
Paratyphi A
Using OrthoMCL, a total of 3323 orthologous genes
present in all 5 Salmonella genomes were identified. Since
seven orthologous genes had low quality alignments, we
excluded these genes and used 3316 orthologous genes
for the analyses described below. Genes that were not
found in all of the five strains were excluded from our
analyses. The 3316 core genes represented 69, 81, 73, and
75%, respectively, of the Salmonella Choleraesuis, Paratyphi A, Typhimurium, and Typhi genes annotated in the
genomes analyzed.

Interestingly, we identified one 2-gene cluster (i.e.,
STM0947 and STM0948), which was repeated 12 times in
the Salmonella Choleraesuis genome, present once in
Typhimurium genome and absent in the Typhi and Paratyphi A genomes. These two genes encode a putative integrase (STM0947) and a putative cytoplasmic protein

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/264

(STM0948), which differ by 4 and 1 non-synonymous
substitution(s), respectively, between Choleraesuis and
Typhimurium LT2. In addition, we identified one other
gene (NT03ST2087, encoding a putative Tn10 transposase), which was repeated 7 times in the Salmonella
Choleraesuis and found once in the Salmonella Typhi
CT18, while not present in the other genomes analyzed.
Salmonella Choleraesuis thus appears to contain at least
two multi-copy mobile genetic elements.
Genes categorized in the JCVI role categories "Hypothetical Proteins", "Protein synthesis", "Unclassified" and
"Unknown function" showed a tendency to have shorter
alignments (P < 0.001, P = 0.027, P = 0.002, P = 0.017,
respectively; one sided U-test) as compared to genes in
other role categories, while genes in the JCVI role categories "Amino Acid Biosynthesis", "DNA Metabolism",
"Energy Metabolism", and "Transport and Binding Proteins" showed a tendency to have longer alignments (P <
0.001, P = 0.001, P < 0.001, and P < 0.001, respectively;
one sided U-test) as compared to genes in other role categories.
Genes in the JCVI role categories "Cellular envelope",
"Hypothetical proteins", and "Unclassified" showed a
tendency to have more non-synonymous substitutions (P
= 0.009, P < 0.001, and P < 0.001, respectively; one sided
U-test) as compared to genes in other role categories.
Genes in the JCVI role categories "Biosynthesis of cofactors, prosthetic groups, and carriers", "Energy Metabolism", and "Transport and Binding Proteins" showed a
tendency to have more synonymous substitutions (P <
0.001, P < 0.001, and P = 0.001, respectively; one sided Utest) as compared to genes in other role categories. Genes
in the JCVI role categories "Amino acid biosynthesis",
"Energy metabolism", "Protein Synthesis", "Purines, pyrimidines, nucleosides, and nucleotides", "Transcription",
and "Transport and binding proteins" showed a tendency
to have higher codon bias (P = 0.006, P < 0.001, P < 0.001,
P < 0.001, P = 0.033, and P = 0.010, respectively; one
sided U-test) as compared to genes in other role categories.
Approximately 8% of core genes show significant evidence
for recombination
Among the 3316 orthologous genes, 233 genes showed
no substitutions; these genes thus were not analyzed for
evidence of homologous recombination (since the methods used cannot detect evidence of recombination if an
alignment presents no polymorphisms). While the
remaining 3083 genes were analyzed for recombination
using GENECONV, only 2849 genes were analyzed using
Max χ2, NSS and PHI (467 ortholog alignments had ≤1
informative site and thus could not be analyzed with these
programs in PhiPack). Overall, 270 genes (8.14% of all

Page 6 of 18

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:264

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/264

3,316 core genes) showed evidence for recombination in
at least one of the four tests used (FDR < 10%). A total of
192, 155, 69, and 20 orthologs showed evidence of
recombination using GENECONV, Max χ2, NSS and PHI,
respectively. Only 10 genes showed evidence for recombination with all 4 approaches (Table 3). Substitution
methods (i.e., GENECONV and Maximum χ2) thus identified more genes with evidence of recombination as compared to compatibility methods (i.e., NSS and PHI). The
differences in the number of genes with evidence of
recombination detected with each method are related to
(i) the power of the methods to detect recombination in
sequences with different divergence and recombination
levels, as well as (ii) the number of false positives associated with each method under different scenarios of heterogeneous substitution rates and convergent evolution. For
example, GENECONV and Maximum χ2 showed more
power to detect recombination as compared to NSS in a
study using computer simulations [47], consistent with
the observation that both of these methods identified the
largest number of genes with evidence of recombination
here. Both GENECONV and NSS also have been found, in
a study using empirical data, to show higher levels of false
positives as compared to Maximum χ2 when the
sequences are very divergent [45], while, in another study
[43] both NSS and Maximum χ2 have been shown to yield
more false positives than PHI particularly in sequences
with mutational hot spots. This is consistent with our
observation that PHI identified the lowest number of
genes with evidence for homologous recombination.
When considering all 270 genes identified as having evidence of recombination by at least one method, genes
with higher numbers of informative sites (P < 0.0001; one

sided U-test), longer alignments (P < 0.0001; one sided Utest), higher codon bias (P < 0.0001; one sided U-test),
and higher nucleotide diversity (P < 0.0001; one sided Utest) were more likely to have evidence for recombination.
An overall chi-square test showed that genes with evidence of recombination were not randomly distributed
among the 20 JCVI role categories (P < 0.001; Fisher's
exact test with Monte Carlo simulation). Subsequent individual chi-square and Fisher's exact tests, determining
whether genes with evidence for recombination were
associated with individual role categories, showed that
genes with evidence of recombination were significantly
overrepresented in the role categories "Biosynthesis of
cofactors, prosthetic groups, and carriers", "Energy metabolism", "Hypothetical proteins" and "Purines, pyrimidines, nucleosides, and nucleotides" (uncorrected P =
0.0035, P = 0.0037, P = 0.0034, and P = 0.0493, respectively) (Figure 2). However, after corrections for multiple
comparisons, the associations are not significant (Bonferroni corrected P = 0.063, P = 0.066, P = 0.061, and P =
0.887, respectively).
Initial analysis revealed a total of 81 Salmonella genes
showing evidence for positive selection
When preliminary positive selection analyses were performed on all 3,316 orthologous genes, 21 genes showed
evidence for positive selection (FDR <20%) in the overall
test (TO) (Additional file 4). A total of 23, 21, 13, and 14
genes, respectively, showed evidence of positive selection
(FDR <20%), using the branch-site test, in the Choleraesuis, Typhi, Typhimurium, and Paratyphi A branch (Additional file 4). As the two Typhi isolates formed a single
branch in only the phylogenies for 1261 genes, only these
genes were used to test for positive selection in the Typhi

JCVI Role Categories

Figure 2
Proportions of genes with evidence of recombination among individual JCVI role categories
Proportions of genes with evidence of recombination among individual JCVI role categories. Genes with evidence
for recombination (Q < 0.1) in at least one of the four tests were included. Bars indicate estimated standard error for the proportion of genes with evidence of recombination in each role category; standard errors were calculated as square root of p (1p)/n, where p is the proportion of genes with evidence of positive selection in a given role category, and n is the total number
of genes in a given role category. Among the 20 JCVI role categories, two did not include genes with evidence of recombination (i.e., "Signal Transduction" and "Viral functions") and are thus not included in this figure.

branch. While 81 genes showed evidence of positive selection in at least one test (including 11 genes with evidence
for positive selection in two tests, see Additional file 4), 32
of these genes also showed evidence of recombination
with at least one of the four recombination tests used
(Table 4; Additional file 4). Genes with evidence of
recombination were more likely to be under positive
selection (P < 0.0001; Chi-square test). Although this may
indicate that positive selection contributes to fixation of
new allelic variants that were generated by recombination
[18], it may also reflect that the positive selection tests
were affected by intragenic recombination [52]. Thus,
FDR corrections for positive selection analyses were
repeated after removal of the 270 genes with evidence of
recombination; these new FDR corrections used 3,046
genes for the overall (TO) test and the branch tests of
Choleraesuis, Typhimurium and Paratyphi, and 1,108
genes for the Typhi branch test. All data in the subsequent
sections represent the data for genes with no evidence for
homologous recombination, unless otherwise stated.

A total of 41 Salmonella genes with no evidence of
recombination showed evidence of positive selection
Positive selection tests identified 5 genes with evidence for
positive selection (FDR <20%) in the overall test (TO)
(Table 5). A total of 8, 16, 7, and 5 genes, respectively,
showed evidence of positive selection (FDR <20%), using
the branch-site test, in the Choleraesuis, Typhi, Typhimurium, and Paratyphi A branches (Table 5; Additional file
5). None of these genes showed of evidence of positive
selection in more than one test.

No association between the low effective number of
codons used by a gene (Nc) and evidence for positive
selection was observed (P > 0.05; one-sided U-test) suggesting that results of positive selection analyses were not
biased by constrains on codon usage, which could result
in a low synonymous substitution rate in these genes.
Moreover, no association between low dS (the number of
synonymous substitutions divided by the number of synonymous sites) and positively selected genes was

bBased on our preliminary analysis, among 3316 orthologous genes, 81 genes showed evidence of positive selection in at least one test. Among 81
genes, 32 genes also showed evidence of recombination with at least one of the four recombination tests used in our study. Statistical analysis
showed that genes evidence of recombination were more likely to be under positive selection (P < 0.0001; chi-square test). Therefore, we excluded
the 270 genes with evidence of recombination from our final positive selection analysis.
cThis column lists the number of genes that show evidence for recombination and positive selection in a given test (e.g., TO); since many genes
showed evidence of recombination in > 1 recombination test, the total number of genes in this column is lower than the sum of the numbers in a
given row. While a total of 32 genes showed evidence of recombination and positive selection, the sum of the numbers in this column is > 32 as
some genes showed evidence of positive selection in two tests.

observed (P > 0.05; one-sided, U-test), supporting that the
results were not biased by a low synonymous substitution
rate. A Fisher's exact test did not find any significant overall association between the 20 JCVI role categories and the
genes under positive selection (Figure 3), possibly due to
the low number of genes under positive selection in each
role category. To further test for associations between positive selection and gene role category, we thus assessed, for
each of the role categories, whether the distribution of the
p-values for each positive selection test deviated from the
random distribution, using the non-parametric U-test.
The JCVI role category "Hypothetical proteins" showed
significant trends of having genes with low p-values in the
Choleraesuis, Typhimurium and Paratyphi A branch specific tests for positive selection (Bonferroni corrected P =
0.042, P = 0.034 and P < 0.001, respectively; one sided Utest) as compared to genes in other role categories. In
addition, genes in the JCVI role categories "Unclassified"
and "Protein synthesis" showed a significant trend of having low p-values in the Choleraesuis and Typhimurium
branch tests for positive selection, respectively, as compared to genes in other role categories (Bonferroni corrected P = 0.002 and P = 0.013, respectively; one sided Utest).
Among Salmonella pathogenicity islands 1 through 6,
three genes showed evidence for positive selection (i.e.,
pipB, STM1088 [siiB], and safC; see Table 6). Overall, 102
of the orthologs analyzed were located in the 6 Salmonella
pathogenicity islands [53,54]; genes in the pathogenicity
islands were not significantly overrepresented (P > 0.05;

Fisher's exact test) among the genes with evidence for positive selection. In addition, three SPI-1 genes (i.e., spaM,
iagB, and sipD), and one SPI-2 gene (ssaI) showed uncorrected p-values < 0.05 in the TO positive selection test (P
= 0.049, 0.017, 0.003 and 0.047, respectively), but failed
to meet the FDR cutoff (q-values = 1, 1, 0.925, and 1,
respectively). Similarly, one SPI-2 gene (sseF) showed a
low uncorrected p-value (P = 0.001) in the Choleraesuis
branch test, but failed to meet the FDR cutoff (q-value =
0.332).
Interestingly, ompC showed evidence for positive selection
in our study (Table 5) as well as in a previous study of
Shigella and E. coli [24]. Our analyses showed that aa residues 228 and 274 show evidence for positive selection
(Additional file 6), while aa 163, 202, and 203 showed
evidence for positive selection in E. coli and Shigella [24].
Salmonella OmpC aa site 228, which was found to be
under positive selection here, is located in a region that is
absent from the E. coli and present in Shigella OmpC,
while Salmonella OmpC aa site 274 is located in a region
that is absent from OmpC in both E. coli and Shigella.
Verification of positive selection and recombination
patterns, identified by genome wide analyses, for four
genes among 42 Salmonella isolates
In order to confirm positive selection and recombination
patterns identified by the full genome analyses, we used a
larger set of 42 Salmonella isolates to sequence and analyze
four genes, including two genes that showed evidence for
positive selection and recombination (i.e., folK-2, sseC)

eOther role categories include Protein synthesis (STM3655), Central intermediary metabolism (STM0603), DNA metabolism (STM0395)

and two genes that only showed evidence for positive
selection (i.e., STM3258, purE). folK-2, which encodes an
enzyme involved in the synthesis of folic acid, could not
be PCR amplified in 6 Salmonella isolates, representing
serotypes Montevideo (n = 2), Oranienburg, Javiana,
Urbana, and Muenster. Analyses of 41 folK-2 sequences (5
sequences from the genomes and 36 newly determined
sequences) confirmed that this gene shows evidence for
recombination (Table 2).sseC, which is located in the Salmonella pathogenicity island 2, could not be PCR amplified in 6 Salmonella isolates, representing serotypes Agona
(n = 2), Havana, Kentucky, and Mbandaka (n = 2). Analyses of the sseC sequences also confirmed that this gene
shows evidence for recombination (Table 2). The
STM3258 gene, which encodes a putative PTS component, could not be PCR amplified in one Salmonella Typhimurium and three serotype 4,5,12:i:-isolates. Results
from the analyses of the resulting 43 STM3258 gene
sequences was consistent with the genome analyses data
and confirmed that this gene shows no evidence for
recombination, but is under positive selection in the Salmonella Typhi branch. purE, which encodes an enzyme
involved in the synthesis of purine ribonucleotide, was
successfully amplified and sequenced in all 42 isolates;

analyses of the resulting sequences also found evidence
for positive selection in the Salmonella Typhi branch
(Table 2); one test (NSS) on all 47 purE gene sequences
found evidence for recombination in this gene (P <
0.001).

Discussion
In this study, we used 5 Salmonella genomes representing
host restricted (i.e., Typhi and Paratyphi A), host adapted
(i.e., Choleraesuis), and unrestricted (i.e., Typhimurium)
serotypes to study the evolution of core genes in different
Salmonella serotypes. A total of 3,316 orthologs found in
these 5 Salmonella genomes were used to (i) identify genes
with evidence of recombination and (ii) identify genes
under positive selection. Positive selection and recombination patterns for four genes of interest were confirmed
in a larger set of isolates representing 23 different serotypes. Overall, our data show that, among the serotypes
evaluated, (i) less than 10% of Salmonella genes in the
core genome show evidence for homologous recombination, (ii) a number of core Salmonella genes are under positive selection, including genes that appear to contribute
to virulence, and (iii) the cell surface protein ompC, which
may contribute to multi drug resistance in Salmonella, is

JCVI Role Categories

Proportions of genes with evidence of positive selection among individual JCVI role categories
Proportions of genes with evidence of positive selection among individual JCVI role categories. Only genes that
showed no evidence for recombination were used to generate the data showed here. Bars indicate estimated standard error
for the proportion of genes with evidence of positive selection in each role category; standard errors were calculated as the
square root of p (1-p)/n, where p is the frequency of genes with evidence of positive selection in a given role category, and n is
the total number of genes in a given role category. Among the 20 JCVI role categories, seven did not include genes with evidence of positive selection and are thus not included in this figure. For each role category, proportion of genes with evidence
of positive selection in the overall test (TO) and each of the four branch specific tests (Ch# = Choleraesuis branch specific test;

targeted by positive selection in both Salmonella and E. coli
[24].
Less than 10% of Salmonella genes show evidence for
intragenic recombination
Since the first bacterial genome was sequenced in 1995,
comparative tools have shown that horizontal gene trans-

fer is the major process for the evolution of prokaryotes
[12,14,55]. Horizontal gene transfer has also been proposed to have played an important role in the evolution
of the Salmonella genome. Salmonella Typhimurium LT2
seems to have acquired a number of novel genomic
regions after the divergence from E. coli around 100 millions years ago [56] and it has been estimated that 25% of

the Salmonella Typhimurium genome may have been
introduced by horizontal gene transfer [3]. Groups of
genes introduced by horizontal gene transfer include
prophages and Salmonella pathogenicity islands (SPIs)
[13]. While the role of horizontal gene transfer in introducing novel genes into the Salmonella genome has been
well established, our analyses show that horizontal transfer (and recombination) of homologous genes also plays
an important role in the diversification of Salmonella; 270
of the 3316 genes characterized (8.1%) showed evidence
for intragenic homologous recombination. By comparison, analysis of four E. coli and two Shigella genomes
found 236 genes with evidence for intragenic recombination, representing approximately 6.3% of genes analyzed
[24]. Chen et al. [23] reported that 12.8% of core genome
genes, found in seven E. coli genomes, showed evidence
for recombination. A study of 410 genes present in six E.
coli and six Salmonella enterica genomes reported that 23%
of these genes showed evidence of recombination in Salmonella; this estimate may be higher than the one reported
here as the 410 genes evaluated do not represent a random sample of the Salmonella core genome [25]. Interestingly, even novel genes that were initially introduced into
the Salmonella genome through horizontal gene transfer
and non-homologous recombination, showed evidence
for further subsequent diversification through homologous recombination (e.g., one and two genes in SPI-1 and
2, respectively, showed evidence for intragenic recombination). A recent analysis by Didelot et al. [57] also suggested that convergence of Salmonella Typhi and Paratyphi
A, two human host-restricted serotypes, through >100
recombination events involving both transfer of novel
genes as well as transfer of homologous genes, further
supporting the importance of horizontal transfer of
homologous gene sequences in the evolution of Salmonella [53].
A number of core Salmonella genes are under positive
selection, including genes that appear to contribute to
virulence and systemic infection
A total of 1.2% of genes found in all five Salmonella
genomes (i.e., 41 genes) showed evidence for positive
selection and no evidence for recombination. While 5
genes showed evidence for positive selection in the overall
analyses, 36 genes showed evidence for positive selection
only in specific branches, indicating considerable branch
specific positive selection in the Salmonella serotypes evaluated. Previously, Petersen et al. [24] reported that,
among 3,505 E. coli and Shigella genes that showed no evidence for recombination, a total of 23 genes (0.66%)
showed evidence for positive selection. Among Grampositive pathogens, Orsi et al. [18] reported that 36 L.
monocytogenes and L. innocua genes (1.6%) showed evidence of positive selection (among a total of 2267 genes
analyzed), while Lefebure and Stanhope [20] reported

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/264

that 11 to 34% of the genes in the Streptococcus core
genome showed evidence for positive selection, although
this study did not control for multiple comparisons and
thus may have somewhat overestimated the number of
genes under positive selection. Recently, Lefebure and
Stanhope [22] showed that 92.5% of non-recombinant
core genome loci are under positive selection, in at least
one lineage, in 17 Campylobacter genomes, which represented 8 different species. While, these different analyses
suggest that the proportion of genes with evidence for
positive selection appears to vary considerably between
different bacterial species or genera, methodological
aspects (e.g., approaches used to correct for multiple comparisons, approaches used to identify genes with evidence
for recombination) may also affect the number of genes
identified as showing evidence for positive selection.
Interestingly, three Salmonella genes with evidence for
positive selection were located in Salmonella pathogenicity
islands (SPIs). SPIs are chromosomal regions that contain
genes contributing to a particular virulence phenotype
[26,58,59]. So far, five common SPIs (i.e., SPI-1 through
SPI-5), found among the majority of Salmonella enterica
strains, as well as a number of additional less common
SPIs have been reported. siiB, which showed evidence for
positive selection, is located in SPI-4 and encodes a probable membrane protein (putative methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein). Morgan et al. [60] reported that the SPI-4
genes siiD, siiE, and siiF play a role in Salmonella Typhimurium intestinal colonization of calves. Kiss et al. [61] specifically showed that a Salmonella Typhimurium strain
lacking siiB shows reduced secretion of SiiE, as compared
to the wildtype, suggesting a possible involvement of siiB
in calf virulence (as an siiE mutant showed reduced colonization in a calf model [60]). pipB, located in SPI-5, also
showed evidence for positive selection. SPI-5 encodes
T3SS-1 and T3SS-2 effector proteins [62]. PipB localizes to
the Salmonella Containing Vacuole (SCV) in mammalian
host cells [63]. In addition, Wood et al. [62] reported that
a pipB null mutant showed reduced intestinal secretory
and inflammatory responses in ligated bovine ileal loops,
suggesting that this, as well as other genes in SPI-5, may
contribute to bovine enteric infections. PipB also appears
to be required for colonization of the cecum, by Salmonella Typhimurium, in chickens [64]. safC, a gene located
in SPI-6 [54], a region called Salmonella enterica centrisome 7 genomic island (SCI) in Salmonella Typhimurium
[65], was also found to be under positive selection. safC
encodes an outer membrane usher protein for Salmonella
atypical fimbriae [65]. While a Salmonella Typhimurium
strain with a deletion of SPI-6 showed reduced ability to
invade Hep2 cells [65], we are not aware of any studies
characterizing virulence of a safC null mutant. While the
SPI-2 genes sseC and sseF have previously been reported to
(i) show evidence for differential evolution [66] and (ii)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:264

contain distinct clusters of polymorphic sites that might
be unique to the human adapted serotypes Typhi and
Paratyphi [67], these genes did not show evidence for positive selection in our final analyses. Both sseC and sseF
showed evidence for positive selection in the Choleraesuis
branch in our initial analysis, but sseC was removed from
the final analysis as this gene also showed evidence of
recombination and sseF did not meet the 20% cutoff for
FDR. In combination with a previous study [66] that
reported that a number of genes located in Salmonella
pathogenicity islands show evidence for differential evolution in different Salmonella serotypes, our findings do
support that positive selection contributes to evolution of
pathogenicity island genes in Salmonella, even though further analyses on larger data sets will be needed to clarify
the contributions of positive selection and recombination
to evolution of these genes.
Overall, three genes in the JCVI role category "Purine,
pyrimidine, nucleoside and nucleotide biosynthesis" (i.e.,
wcaH, purE and nrdI) showed evidence for positive selection (while showing no evidence for recombination).
wcaH, which encodes a GDP-mannose mannosyl hydrolase, is under positive selection in the Typhimurium
branch, while purE and nrdI were found to be under positive selection in the Typhi branch. purE encodes a phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxylase, while nrdI,
which is located in an operon with genes that encode a
Class 1b ribonucleotide reductase, encodes a small flavoprotein with unknown function in Streptococcus pyogenes
[68]. Positive selection for purE in the Salmonella Typhi
branch was also confirmed in our analyses of 22 human
and 20 animal Salmonella isolates, which included two
additional Typhi strains. This is a striking finding since
Samant et al. [69] recently reported that de novo nucleotide biosynthesis is essential for bacterial growth in
blood. As Salmonella Typhi predominantly causes systemic septicemic infections in humans, these findings suggest that adaptive changes in genes encoding purine,
pyrimidine, nucleoside and nucleotide biosynthesis functions may have been critical in the evolution of this host
restricted human pathogen. Our findings thus further support that development of novel drugs targeting appropriate purine, pyrimidine, nucleoside and nucleotide
biosynthesis pathways may represent an opportunity for
therapeutic approaches for bacterial pathogens causing
septicemic infections [69].
Additional genes with evidence for positive selection and
possible roles in host infection include katG, which
encodes a catalase. While antioxidant defenses mechanism appear to contribute to virulence in a number of
pathogens, Salmonella katG null mutations have shown no
affect on Salmonella's ability to survive inside phagocytic
cells and in a murine model of infection [70]. The impor-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/264

tance of adaptive changes in Salmonella katG thus remains
to be determined. It seems possible that adaptive changes
in genes involved in anaerobic growth may contribute to
an improved ability of different strains of this gastrointestinal pathogen to survive under anaerobic conditions
encountered in the intestinal tract. We also identified a
number of genes with evidence for positive selection that
have no apparent link to infection and virulence, including malZ, malT, and mtlA, which encode, respectively, a
maltodextrin glucosidase, a transcriptional activator of
mal genes, and a mannitol specific PTS system component. While it has been proposed that horizontal transfer
of genes encoding proteins involved in acquisition and
synthesis of nutrients and genes encoding components of
metabolic networks is critical as bacteria adapt to specific
environments and ecological niches [12], our findings
suggest that positive selection of genes encoding metabolic capabilities also contribute to adaptation to new
environments.
Cell surface proteins are targeted by positive selection in
both Salmonella and E. coli
While we identified, in our preliminary analysis, three
genes encoding outer membrane proteins (ompC, ompS1
and ompS2) that showed evidence for positive selection,
only ompC showed no evidence of recombination. ompC,
a highly expressed omp gene, encodes a protein that not
only appears to play a role in Salmonella virulence [71],
but also is a receptor for Gifsy-1 and Gifsy-2 phages [72].
An analysis of six E. coli and Shigella genomes also found
that three omp genes (i.e., ompF, ompC and ompA) showed
evidence of positive selection [24], while Chen et al. [23]
reported that ompC and ompF were under positive selection in uropathogenic E. coli strains. Furthermore, genes
encoding the outer membrane proteins OmpA and OmpB
showed evidence for positive selection in Rickettsia spp.
[73]. Overall, these data strongly suggest that adaptive
changes in genes encoding outer membrane proteins critically contribute to the evolution of a variety of bacteria,
including pathogenic enterobacteriaciae. In particular,
ompC, which encodes one of the most abundant E. coli
proteins [24], appears to be under positive selection in a
number of pathogenic enterobacteriaciae. As proposed by
Petersen et al. [24], positive selection in omp genes may be
an important mechanism that facilitates adaptation of
bacterial pathogens allowing them to escape recognition
by the host immune system and phages. In addition,
mutations in porin genes (e.g., those belonging to OmpC
and OmpF groups), as well as changes in Omp expression
levels, have been linked to increased resistance to βlactam antibiotics [74-76]. For example, under strong
antibiotic pressure, bacteria can reduce the influx of antibiotic through downregulation of porin expression or
expression of modified porins. Positive selection in porin
genes, particularly ompC thus may also be associated with

Page 14 of 18

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:264

selection to increase antibiotic resistance. These findings
provide potentially interesting avenues for future mutagenesis studies to elucidate the role of ompC polymorphisms in various phenotypes, including β-lactam
resistance.

Conclusion
Our analyses strongly suggest that both homologous
recombination and positive selection (particularly lineage
specific positive selection) contribute to the evolution of
the Salmonella core genome, at least in the serotypes analyzed here. While genes with evidence of positive selection
identified here may provide promising targets for future
mutational studies aimed at further identifying mechanisms that contribute to Salmonella diversification, including its adaptation to specific host species, one cannot
extrapolate our findings on a few Salmonella serotypes to
other serotypes unless additional analyses are performed.
The relevance of the lineage specific positive selection patterns identified here is supported, though, by the convergence of the positive selection patterns identified in the
Salmonella Typhi lineage (i.e., for genes encoding proteins
involved in purine, pyrimidine, nucleoside and nucleotide biosynthesis) and experimental evidence that genes
involved in de novo nucleotide biosynthesis are essential
for bacterial growth in blood [69].
In conjunction with previous genome wide studies on
positive selection in uropathogenic E. coli [23], Shigella
and E. coli [24], Listeria spp. [18], Campylobacter [22] and
Streptococcus spp. [20], our data clearly indicate the positive selection and homologous recombination among
core genome genes play an important role in the evolution of bacterial pathogens, in addition to the well established importance of gene acquisition and deletion.
Positive selection and homologous recombination also
appear to contribute to further evolution of novel genes
initially acquired by lateral gene transfer, such as selected
genes in the Salmonella pathogenicity islands. As additional pathogen genomes, including additional Salmonella
genomes, have and continue to become available, positive
selection and recombination analyses on larger numbers
of genomes will further improve our understanding of
bacterial pathogens.
