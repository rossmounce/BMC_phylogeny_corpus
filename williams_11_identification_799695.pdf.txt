Identification and analysis of the RNA degrading
complexes and machinery of Giardia lamblia
using an in silico approach
Christopher W Williams and Heidi G Elmendorf*

Abstract
Background: RNA degradation is critical to the survival of all cells. With increasing evidence for pervasive
transcription in cells, RNA degradation has gained recognition as a means of regulating gene expression. Yet, RNA
degradation machinery has been studied extensively in only a few eukaryotic organisms, including Saccharomyces
cerevisiae and humans. Giardia lamblia is a parasitic protist with unusual genomic traits: it is binucleated and
tetraploid, has a very compact genome, displays a theme of genomic minimalism with cellular machinery
commonly comprised of a reduced number of protein components, and has a remarkably large population of
long, stable, noncoding, antisense RNAs.
Results: Here we use in silico approaches to investigate the major RNA degradation machinery in Giardia lamblia
and compare it to a broad array of other parasitic protists. We have found key constituents of the deadenylation
and decapping machinery and of the 5’-3’ RNA degradation pathway. We have similarly found that all of the major
3’-5’ RNA degradation pathways are present in Giardia, including both exosome-dependent and exosomeindependent machinery. However, we observe significant loss of RNA degradation machinery genes that will result
in important differences in the protein composition, and potentially functionality, of the various RNA degradation
pathways. This is most apparent in the exosome, the central mediator of 3’-5’ degradation, which apparently
contains an altered core configuration in both Giardia and Plasmodium, with only four, instead of the canonical six,
distinct subunits. Additionally the exosome in Giardia is missing both the Rrp6, Nab3, and Nrd1 proteins, known to
be key regulators of noncoding transcript stability in other cells.
Conclusions: These findings suggest that although the full complement of the major RNA degradation
mechanisms were present - and likely functional - early in eukaryotic evolution, the composition and function of
the complexes is more variable than previously appreciated. We suggest that the missing components of the
exosome complex provide an explanation for the stable abundance of sterile RNA species in Giardia.

Background
Cells control RNA levels through the regulation of both
transcription and degradation. Organisms must degrade
not only aberrantly folded or misprocessed RNAs, but
also functional RNA transcripts that are no longer
needed by the cell. In order to distinguish among and
degrade only the appropriate RNA transcripts, cells have
developed multiple RNA degradation processes and complexes. RNA degradation can occur by digestion inwards
from the ends, using 5’ to 3’ and 3’ to 5’ exonucleases, or

by digestion at internal sites using endonucleases. RNA
degradation often, though not always, also involves deadenylation (for both 5’ to 3’ and 3’ to 5’ degradation) and
decapping (for 5’ to 3’ degradation) of the transcripts.
The range of RNA degradation machinery includes both
nuclear and cytoplasmic components.
RNA degradation typically begins with the shortening of
the long poly-A tail of mRNA transcripts. Although some
RNA degradation pathways can apparently act on polyadenylated transcripts, e.g. nonstop decay (NSD), nonsensemediated decay (NMD), and endonucleolytic cleavage
(RNAi), the majority of 5’ to 3’ and 3’ to 5’ exonucleolytic
activities require the prior removal of the poly-A tail. Two

proteins, Ccr4p and/or Caf1p, have been shown to act as
the catalytic core of the deadenylation machinery in all
eukaryotic cells examined to date [1-3]. 5’ to 3’ degradation depends on the prior removal of the 5’ cap structure
followed by subsequent 5’ to 3’ exonucleolytic cleavage. In
most cells this is performed by the Dcp1p/Dcp2p holoenzyme with the involvement of a wide and diverse array of
additional protein machinery [4-6].
The exosome, a 3’ to 5’ exonuclease complex, is one of
the important RNA degradation complexes and can be
used as a means of classifying the different machinery
into two groups: the exosome-dependent and the exosome-independent pathways. It is this convention that
we use here to describe the RNA degradation machinery
in Giardia lamblia and other parasitic protists. Exosomes
have clear homologs in all three domains of life. Bacteria,
archaea, and eukaryotes possess functionally analogous
core 3’ to 5’ RNA degradation complexes in the bacterial
polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase), the archaeal
exosome, and the eukaryotic exosome, respectively. The
similarity in the structure of all three mRNA degradation
complexes is striking and suggests that the highly conserved structures are necessary for mRNA degradation
and have been maintained throughout evolutionary
history.
The bacterial PNPase exists as a homotrimer, in which
each monomer possesses two tandem RNase PH domains
in addition to single S1 and KH domains [7]. RNase PH
domains have exonucleolytic activity, although only one of
the two domains in each monomer is thought to be active,
while the S1 and KH domains have RNA binding capacity
[7]. The archaeal exosome ring is composed of repeating
Rrp41/42 heterodimers arranged into a hexamer with
three total copies of the stabilizing proteins Rrp4 and Csl4
acting as caps to the complex. The Rrp41 and Rrp42 subunits possess RNase PH domains, but Rrp41 is the only
exonucleolytic component of the complex, again resulting
in three active sites per complex [7,8]. Rrp4 and Csl4 both
possess S1 domains and bind RNA.
In eukaryotes, the core exosome also exists as a ring
structure made of a heterohexamer of proteins with
RNase PH domains (the three Rrp 41-like proteins are
Rrps41, 46 and Mtr3, and the three Rrp 42-like proteins
are Rrps42, 43, and 45) with a trio of additional RNAbinding proteins which contain S1 domains (Rrps 4, 40,
and Csl4) that broadly act as the entry to the pore of the
exosome and in eukaryotic exosomes further act to stabilize the hexameric ring [9,10]. It is believed that, through
gene duplication either early in the eukaryotic lineage or
prior to the divergence of eukaryotes, rrp41 gave rise to
both rrp46 and mtr3, while rrp42 gave rise to rrp43 and
rrp45 [7]. The ring and stabilizing proteins are commonly
associated with Rrp6 and Rrp44, both of which possess
nucleolytic activity [9,11]. The core proteins display

Page 2 of 15

homology to archaeal exosome and bacterial PNPase proteins, whereas Rrp6 and Rrp44 display homology to bacterial RNases [12-14]. In some eukaryotes, the RNase PH
domain of Rrp41 provides exonucleolytic activity, whereas
in other species the activity is dependent upon Rrp6 and
Rrp44 [9,11,15].
Although the exosome is an important complex involved
in RNA degradation in eukaryotes, additional complexes
also play a role in RNA degradation either through exosome-dependent or exosome-independent processes. Exosome-dependent complexes act mainly by preparing RNA
substrates for degradation by the exosome, whereas exosome-independent complexes possess nucleolytic activity
of their own. These additional complexes impart specificity to its function so that RNA is not degraded prematurely, and only a subset of RNA is targeted at any one
time.
The exosome-dependent machinery includes the
TRAMP complex, Pumilio (Puf) proteins, Nonsense
mediated decay (NMD), Nonstop decay (NSD), and No-go
decay (NGD) complexes. In the nucleus, the exosome can
be found to be associated with the TRAMP complex,
which aids in the degradation, maturation, and removal of
secondary structures of RNA molecules through the posttranscriptional addition of a poly-A tail by TRAMP proteins Trf4/5 or via the helicase activity of TRAMP protein
Mtr4, respectively [16,17]. In the cytoplasm a subset of Puf
proteins bind mRNAs via sequence-specific elements in
the 3’ untranslated regions (UTRs) and recruit the deadenylation machinery [18,19]. Also in the cytoplasm, the
NMD, NSD, and NGD pathways act as mRNA quality
control and are activated in response to mRNAs containing premature termination codons (PTCs), no stop codon,
or secondary structures such as stem loops, respectively.
The NMD complex may possess endonucleolytic activity,
but requires the exosome for complete degradation of
RNAs.
The exosome-independent complexes are the RNAi
machinery and the Ccr4-Not complex. RNAi acts to
silence gene expression through endonucleolytic degradation of targeted mRNA transcripts or translation inhibition. RNAi machinery has been identified in a variety of
eukaryotic organisms, from single-celled organisms to
metazoans but is not ubiquitously present. Two components of the Ccr4-Not complex, which is conserved from
S. cerevisiae to humans [20], have roles in mRNA deadenylation; Ccr4 and Caf1 deadenylate mRNA transcripts,
although optimal degradation for many transcripts still
requires the exosome [21].
The parasitic protists regulate gene expression through
many different mechanisms, both transcriptional and
post-transcriptional. Yet, while we understand much
about transcriptional regulation, the study of mRNA
degradation machinery in the parasitic protists is still in

Williams and Elmendorf BMC Genomics 2011, 12:586
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/586

its early stages. This is perhaps especially surprising
because RNA degradation is likely to play an unusually
prominent role in organisms that exhibit diminished regulation of gene expression at the transcriptional level, as
is known to be the case for several parasitic protists. For
example, Trypanosoma brucei transcribes its genes polycistronically, implying that mRNA processing and degradation are its primary means of regulating gene
expression [22-24]. And Giardia lamblia transcribes an
abundance of full-length sterile antisense transcripts that
are capped and polyadenylated [25], suggesting a role for
mRNA degradation to eliminate these aberrant
transcripts.
In this paper, we discuss our efforts to identify the
mRNA degradation machinery in Giardia lamblia using
in silico approaches. We additionally included several
other parasitic protists (Entamoeba histolytica, Trichomonas vaginalis, Trypansoma brucei, and Plasmodium falciparum) in our analyses of the core and peripheral
exosome components for comparison, building on the
work of previous researchers in this field [1,23,24,26-33].
We focused especially on Giardia given its evolutionary
divergence [34,35], severely reduced repertoire of transcriptional machinery [34,36], and unusual patterns of
gene expression [37,38]. We identified an extensive collection of genes coding for proteins with significant sequence
similarity to proteins that participate in RNA degradation
pathways in other eukaryotes. Pathways such as the RNAi
[39-41] and nonsense mediated decay pathways [28,42]
previously have been identified in Giardia. However, these
comparisons also revealed that a substantial number of
protein constituents of mRNA degradation complexes in
other eukaryotes are either absent or sufficiently divergent
to thwart detection by similarity searches in these parasitic
protists. We use this new knowledge to consider which
protein components may comprise the most reduced core
exosome structure in eukaryotes and to postulate explanations for observed patterns of mRNA transcripts in
Giardia.

Results
Preparing the transcripts for degradation
Deadenylation machinery

Deadenylation, the removal of the 3’ polyA tail, is typically performed by Ccr4p and Caf1p of the Ccr4-Not
complex found in most eukaryotes studied to date, while
the Pan2p/Pan3p complex plays a secondary role [1,3].
The Ccr4-Not complex is a multi-subunit complex with
roles in transcription, mRNA and protein degradation,
and cell division [20]. Members of the complex are the
Not proteins 1-5, Ccr4, and the Caf proteins, Caf1 (also
known as Pop2), Caf40, and Caf130. The Not1 protein
acts as a scaffold to which other members of the complex

Page 3 of 15

attach and is necessary for S. cerevisiae viability [20].
Pop2p acts a scaffold for Ccr4p and also may have additional roles in decapping of transcripts in S. cerevisiae [2].
Giardia possesses only a subset of the genes associated
with the Ccr4-Not complex that may be sufficient for its
functionality in the parasite (Additional Files 1 and 2). We
identified four candidate Not genes, as well as candidate
genes for Caf1, confirming a previous identification of
Caf1 in Giardia [1]. The classification of three of the Not
genes as Not1, Not2, and Not4 was possible based on the
presence of defined domains. The protein identified as
most similar to Not1p has only a partial Not1 domain,
while Not2p and Not4p possess complete domains. The
fourth protein could possibly be either Not3p or Not5p
based on sequence similarity search results, although the
better scores and E-values obtained against Not3 proteins
suggests it is more likely Not3p. Although we were unable
to detect homologs of Ccr4, Caf40, Caf130 or CNot10 in
the Giardia genome, the presence of the Not proteins and
Caf1p should be sufficient to ensure a functional deadenylation complex.
The Pan2-Pan3 complex is thought to play a role in
either initiating or subsequently trimming the poly-A tails
in support of Ccr4-Caf1-Not complex activity. The complex functions through association of Pan3 with Pabp1 to
recognize and associate with the poly-A tail of transcripts.
We were able to detect genes with sequence similarity to
Pan2 and Pabp1 in Giardia but could not detect a Pan3
homolog, raising questions about whether this complex
would be present and functional in the parasite (Additional Files 1 and 2). A mammalian deadenylase, PARN,
was also missing from Giardia. Of the other parasitic protists examined to date for deadenylation machinery, Trypanosoma brucei has been shown to contain both the
Ccr4 -Not complex and the Pan2-Pan3 complex [1,26],
while Plasmodium falciparum contained a majority of the
required components of the Ccr4-Not complex but was
also missing the Pan2-Pan3 complex [27].
Decapping machinery

All parasitic protists examined to date contain traditional
5’ 7-methylguanosine caps, although a biochemically
modified cap structure is found on the spliced leader
RNA in Trypanosoma. In Giardia the presence of 5’ 7methylguanosine caps have been identified on both coding and sterile transcripts [25]. The removal of this cap is
required for 5’-3’ exonuclease processing. Decapping in
other cells requires the decapping holoenzyme, comprised of Dcp1p and the catalytic subunit Dcp2p. A wide
array of other machinery has been shown to interact with
and mediate the activity of Dcp in vitro and in vivo,
including Lsm (like-Sm) proteins, the Upf proteins, the
Edc proteins, Dhh1p and Pat1p; while more recent
research has suggested the presence of additional

Williams and Elmendorf BMC Genomics 2011, 12:586
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/586

members of the decapping family, such as DcpS and
Headless, and an astonishing diversity of proteins associated with mRNA storage and decay (e.g. TTP/Brf1 and
2; AUF1; HuR; KSRP; CUG-BP) in specific lineages, making it clear that the process of mRNA decay is both precise and organism-specific [43,44]. These proteins and
the decapped mRNA often assemble into degradation
complexes referred to as P-bodies (processing bodies).
Here we identify a Dhh1p and a divergent Giardia
Dcp2-like protein (Additional Files 1 and 2). Like many
eukaryotic helicases, Dhh1p protein possesses a DEXDc
superfamily domain and when reciprocally BLAST against
S. cerevisiae, the top identified gene is the Dhh1. The
S. cerevisae Dcp2 protein has both dcp2 and nudix
domains. The dcp2 domain aids in mRNA cap removal
while the nudix hydrolase domain catalyzes catabolism of
nucleotide diphosphates linked to other molecules. The
identified Giardia protein contains a nudix hydrolase
domain but is missing the dcp2 domain. However, when
used as a query in BLASTp, significant hits identify it as a
likely mRNA decapping enzyme and a possible Dcp2
homolog. We were unable to identify the Edc proteins,
Pat1p, or any of the organism-specific alternative decapping machinery and P-body components, such as DcpS,
Headless, TTP/Brf1and2. AUF1, etc. We think it likely
therefore that the evolutionary divergence of Giardia has
dictated either a unique array of P-body proteins specific
to the Diplomond lineage or perhaps P-bodies are simply
absent from Giardia.
Another set of proteins which have roles in decapping
and mRNA degradation are the Lsm (like-Sm) proteins.
Members of the Sm/Lsm protein family are conserved
in bacteria and archaea [45]. This family of proteins
plays roles in RNA processing, splicing and mRNA decapping [46,47] and some of the proteins colocalize with
the mRNA decapping machinery [48]. The Lsm complex
involved in mRNA degradation is made of Lsm proteins
1-7 and they form a heteroheptameric ring. In total we
were able to identify 14 proteins with Sm-like domains
using the Interpro domain accessory function in the
Giardia genome database (Additional File 2). Of the 14
proteins, 12 had Conserved Domain Database (CDD)
recognizable Lsm domains, yet only four of these proteins possess notable sequence similarity to Lsm proteins in S. cerevisiae. The remaining 8 proteins are likely
members of the Sm protein family which have roles in
pre-mRNA splicing [46]. The results we see here are
consistent with what is seen in the other complexes
which we observed, in that some machinery is present
and recognizable while other components cannot be
identified. The homologous complex in bacteria, known
as the Hfq complex is a homohexamer [45], therefore
possibilities exist that Lsm complex may still form in
Giardia despite only identifying four Lsm proteins.

5’ to 3’ Degradation

Once mRNA transcripts are decapped, they are accessible
to the 5’ to 3’ degradation machinery. The proteins
responsible for 5’ to 3’ degradation of eukaryotic mRNAs
are the Xrn proteins [6,49]. S. cerevisiae possesses two Xrn
proteins: Rat1p (nuclear) and Xrn1p (cytoplasmic). The
nuclear form is responsible for nuclear processing of
RNAs while Xrn1p is responsible for degradation of cytoplasmic mRNA transcripts. The XRN domain is located in
the N-terminus of the protein and provides 5’ to 3’ exonucleolytic activity. Although S. cerevisiae has two homologs,
T. brucei possesses four Xrnp homologs [33]. All four are
expressed in T. brucei, although only two of the four are
needed for growth. In our search, we were able to identify
two proteins with sequence similarity to Xrnp in Giardia
(GL50803_24133 and GL50803_113365) (Additional Files
1 and 2). The former is more similar to S. cerevisiae Rat1p
whereas the latter has more similarity with Xrn1p. The
presence of these two exonucleases supports the likely
presence of a functional 5’ to 3’ degradation pathway.
3’ to 5’ Degradation
Identification of exosome components

Eleven main proteins comprise the eukaryotic exosome:
six RNase PH proteins (Rrp41p, Rrp42p, Rrp43p, Rrp45p,
Rrp46p, and Mtr3p), three stabilizing proteins (Rrp4p,
Rrp40p and Csl4p), and two peripheral proteins (Rrp6p
and Rrp44p). Rrp6p and Rrp44p are not always found in
the exosome complex together within the same organism.
For example, S. cerevisiae Rrp6p and Rrp44p are found
only with the nuclear exosome and in both nuclear and
cytoplasmic exosomes, respectively [13,14], while human
Rrp6, and Rrp44 proteins (hDIS3 and hDIS3L) are localized to the nucleolus, the nucleus and cytoplasm, and primarily the cytoplasm respectively [50]. Human DIS3 and
DIS3L display a lower affinity for the exosome than the
S. cerevisiae homolog. In S. cerevisiae, H. sapiens, and
A. thaliana, we found all eleven of the previously identified exosome genes, validating our similarity search protocol. However, in our investigation of the parasitic protists,
we were unable to identify some specific exosome components. We first discuss our detailed characterization of the
putative exosome proteins in Giardia, followed by our
characterization of the exosome protein components in
the other parasitic protists.
In the search for exosome components in Giardia, we
had differential success depending on whether we used
the PFAM or the CDD definitions. Using multiple
approaches we identified only four of the expected six
RNase PH domain proteins (Additional Files 1 and 2).
GL50803_1890, GL50803_5632, and GL50803_40007 all
contain RNase PH domains; GL50803_9847 does not have
a true RNase PH domain but possesses the CDD multidomain COG2123 that is associated with RNase PH

Williams and Elmendorf BMC Genomics 2011, 12:586

domains (Additional File 1). It is unclear what arrangement of the four RNase PH domain proteins comprises
the hexameric exosome in Giardia. Continuing this theme
of genomic diminution, we were able to identify genes for
only two of the three associated proteins, rrp4 and rrp40
but not csl4. We were also able to identify a gene for only
one of the two exosome peripheral proteins: rrp44, identifiable by its RNase II-like domain (RNB), but not rrp6, or
any other DNA Q domain-containing proteins. In addition
to the putative Rrp44p homolog, we also were able to
identify a second protein (GL50803_9912) containing an
RNase II like domain in Giardia, but it displayed a sufficiently low similarity with Rrp44p that we cannot confirm
a possible identity. The schematics in Additional File 1
provide a visual representation of the identified proteins in
Giardia and their similarity to S. cerevisiae RNA degradation proteins.
In the other parasitic protists, T. brucei, P. falciparum,
T. vaginalis, and E. histolytica, the identified protein repertoires for exosomes are more complete but often still partial (Table 1). T. brucei and E. histolytica had six proteins
containing RNase PH domains, the correct number to
construct a heterohexameric exosome. We note that our
ability to find all six RNase PH domain proteins in T. brucei by similarity searches represents an improvement compared to previous studies [22,24] and indicates a high level
of sensitivity for divergent protein sequences in our study.
T. vaginalis had seven identifiable proteins containing
RNase PH domains; this number more than accounts for
enough proteins to form the hexameric exosome ring and
reflects a common theme of gene family expansion in
T. vaginalis [51]. However, P. falciparum, like Giardia, has
only four proteins with recognizable RNase PH domains.
Previous work from the DeRisi group was able to identify
only three RNase PH proteins in P. falciparum. That work
was published in 2007, where genome annotation was less
complete than when we performed our search. They performed BLASTP and reciprocal BLASTP to identify the
putative degradation proteins in Plasmodium [27].
Additionally, T. brucei, P. falciparum, and T. vaginalis
possess all three exosome stabilizing proteins, whereas
E. histolytica like Giardia, has only rrp4 and rrp40, but
lacks a csl4 homolog (Table 1). Unlike Giardia all four of
these parasitic protists contained putative homologs for
both rrp6 and rrp44.
Exonucleolytic potential of RNase PH and Rrp44
homologous proteins

To define the exonucleolytic potential of the degenerate
Giardia exosome, we first sought to classify the RNase PH
proteins as either Rrp41-like or Rrp42-like. The archaeal
exosome is composed of three Rrp41-42 heterodimers,
and the exonucleolytic activity is maintained solely in the
Rrp41p subunit [13,52]. In eukaryotic species the exosome
is composed of three Rrp41-like and three Rrp42-like

Page 5 of 15

proteins, although the exonucleoytic activity of the Rrp41like proteins is sometimes lost due to mutation of the catalytic or the phosphate binding sites [8]. Since the eukaryotic exosome likely evolved from the archaeal exosome,
we expected to be able to identify at least one Rrp41-like
and Rrp42-like protein in each of the parasitic protists.
With the goal of identifying whether the RNase PH proteins were Rrp41-like or Rrp42-like in their origin, we constructed protein phylogenies.
Our first step was construction of a protein phylogeny
using Rrp41p-like and Rrp42p-like amino acid sequences
from S. cerevisiae, H. sapiens, and S. solfataricus RNase
PH protein amino acid sequences. Protein sequences were
aligned in MUSCLE and trimmed using G-blocks as stated
in the methods to limit our analysis to the more highly
conserved regions of the proteins. This resulted in protein
fragments of 110-115 amino acids from proteins of ~240
and ~300 amino acids for Rrp41-like and Rrp42-like proteins, respectively, for use in construction of the phylogeny. The retained amino acid sequences contained the
RNase PH domain, with approximately ten amino acids
flanking each end. The Phylip 3.69 package was run iteratively to generate 100 trees for estimation of bootstrap
values. We observed distinct stratification of Rrp41-like
and Rrp42-like proteins; however, node values showed
only moderate support for placement into each Rrp subtype (Figure 1A), indicating high sequence divergence of
these proteins.
However, with the addition of Giardia sequences, this
divergence was profoundly exacerbated, and we observed
considerable movement of sequences from previously
strong clades that drastically altered the tree topology,
eroding the stratification of the Rrp41-like and Rrp42-like
proteins (Figure 1B). This phenomenon was observed even
with the addition of single Giardia sequences (data not
shown). Our inability to group these RNase PH proteins
was not specific to Giardia, as similar difficulties were
encountered with the use of RNase PH proteins from the
other parasitic protists. Although frustrated in our attempt
to classify the RNase PH domain proteins, our inability to
produce informative gene trees about protein identity
argues that high levels of sequence divergence are tolerated in the proteins that comprise the exosome ring.
As an alternative approach to classification of Giardia’s
RNase PH domain-containing proteins, we sought to
determine which of the proteins possess the necessary
amino acid residues for phosphate binding and catalytic
activity. The amino acid alignment of the four genes containing the Giardia’s RNase PH domains shows that while
all possess the necessary residues for activity of the catalytic site, only GL50803_5632 has even one of the two
amino acids required for phosphate binding (not shown).
This technique, while not helping to classify the Giardia
RNase PH proteins, does suggest that all RNase PH

Figure 1 Rnase PH protein phylogenies reveal an absence of two subunits in Giardia. Gene trees were made to diagram the relatedness
of the RNase PH protein amino acid sequences in S. serevisisae, H. sapiens, S. solfataricus, and G. lamblia. Node values shown are out of 100 and
nodes with no labels had values below 20. (A) The protein parsimony tree displays relatedness between RNase PH proteins of S. cerevisiae, H.
sapiens, and S. solfataricus. The tree is separated into Rrp41-like and Rrp42-like proteins with node values providing moderate support for the
inferred clades. (B) Addition of putative Giardia RNase PH proteins results in disrupted clades and reduced bootstrap values.

domain-containing genes in Giardia are nucleolytically
inactive.
In contrast, examination of the putative Giardia Rrp44
homolog revealed that this enzyme is most likely an active
enzyme with exonucleolytic activity. When compared with
Escherichia coli RNase II, S. cerevisae and H. sapiens
Rrp44 proteins, the putative Giardia homolog shares a
high percentage of catalytic residues present in the enzymatic pocket [12,53], although it is missing the classical
PIN domain characteristic of some classes of nucleases
[53] (Figure 2). The E. coli RNase II has 17 identified residues that are found in the catalytic site of the enzyme that
are important for enzyme catalysis [12,53]. Human
Rrp44p homologs possess 13 of the 17 residues found
within the catalytic site [53], while Giardia and S. cerevisiae each possess 12 of the 17 amino acids. In one position
in both S. cerevisiae and Giardia Rrp44 proteins, there is
an amino acid substitution where a negatively charged
amino acid is replaced with another negatively charged
amino acid; S. cerevisiae has an aspartate in place of glutamate at D363 while Giardia has an aspartate in place of
glutamate at D360. The substitution is not likely to result
in alterations in bond forming. In addition, the putative
Giardia Rrp44 homolog possesses all four of the domains
believed to play a role in the RNA binding activity of the
enzyme. These RNA binding domains are highly conserved in species as divergent as H. sapiens and Giardia.
Based on the presence of these highly conserved domains,
and the number of residues identified as part of the catalytic sites, we believe that it is likely that the putative

Giardia Rrp44p homolog possesses exonucleolytic activity
and thus the exosome in conjunction with putative
Rrp44p in Giardia is also likely active. The absence of an
Rrp6p homolog means that Rrp44p is potentially the only
nucleolytically active enzyme in the Giardia exosome
complex.
Exosome-dependent complexes and proteins
TRAMP complex

The TRAMP complex is a nuclear-localized, exosomeassociated protein complex, responsible for polyadenylation of RNA molecules that will be targeted for further
processing or degradation [16,17,54]. The RNA binding
proteins Air1p/2p are responsible for identification and
binding of the targeted RNA transcripts. The poly-A polymerase-like proteins, Trf4p/5p are responsible for the
addition of the poly-A tails to all RNA species that are
incorrectly folded or aberrantly produced. Lastly Mtr4p,
an RNA helicase, is thought to remove the secondary
structure of folded transcripts. The Trf5p/Air1p/Mtr4p
complex localizes mainly to the nucleolus, while the
Trf4p/Air2p/Mtr4p complex is found throughout the
remaining nucleus in S. cerevisiae [16].
We identified genes with sequence and domain similarity to Trf4/5 and Mtr4 in Giardia (Additional Files 1 and
2). The Giardia Trf4p/5p proteins contain the canonical
nucleotidyltransferase domains, suggesting that they are
functionally capable of adding poly-A tails to RNAs. However, we identified only one gene with a partial Air1
domain in the Giardia genome. S. cerevisiae proteins

Figure 2 Identification of Rrp44 protein catalytic potential in Giardia. Alignment of E. coli RNase II with Rrp44 amino acid sequences from
G. lamblia (G.l.), S. cerevisiae (S.c.), and H. sapiens (H.s.) show levels of high conservation. Important regions required for RNA binding are
underlined. Dark gray represents amino acid identity while the light gray represents amino acid similarity. The conserved amino acids in the
catalytic pocket of E. coli RNase II are noted by an asterisk above the sequence.

Air1p and Air2p both contain an Air1 domain, and deletion of either Air1p or 2p does not inhibit the processing
of some snoRNAs and rRNAs, while deletion of both proteins leads to a dramatic increase in unprocessed snoRNAs
[17]. Therefore, it is possible that both Giardia TRAMP
complexes function normally in the presence of a single
Air1 domain-containing protein.
Puf proteins

Members of the Puf family of proteins are identified in a
variety of eukaryotes with a variable number of genes in
each species [55-57]; different members of the Puf protein
family are either nuclear or cytoplasmic in their localization. Although in some cell types, Puf proteins act to stabilize mRNA transcripts and increase levels of translation,
more typically Puf proteins reduce mRNA expression
either through inhibition of translation or through

mediation of mRNA decay. For example, Puf5 in yeast
binds to Pop2 (Caf1) to recruit the Ccr4p deadenylase to
the 3’ UTRs of mRNAs in the cytoplasm [18,19]. Given
the unusually short 3’ UTRs of Giardia mRNAs, it was
not apparent that the Puf proteins would be relevant in
the parasite, but we were able to identify a full repertoire
of five genes containing Puf repeats in Giardia. Higher
eukaryotes generally have fewer members of the family
[56-58]. Puf proteins normally possess eight Puf repeats in
the C-terminus [56], although studies in S. cerevisiae suggest that six Puf repeats are sufficient for RNA binding
[59]. Of the five identified proteins in Giardia, one contains eight Puf repeats, three contain between five and
seven repeats in the C-terminal half of the protein, and
one may be a pseudogene with only a partial N-terminal
RNA binding domain with only three repeats (Additional

Files 1 and 2). Amino acid sequence comparison with S.
cerevisiae Puf protein sequences suggests that the putative
Giardia Puf proteins may be homologs of S. cerevisae Puf
proteins that primarily bind ribosomal RNAs and mRNAs
encoding nuclear localized proteins. This designation was
obtained using Giardia Puf proteins as query for BLASTP
in the Saccharomyces genome database.
Nonsense-mediated decay

Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) is responsible for the
translation-coupled degradation of mRNA transcripts containing premature termination codons (PTCs) [60,61], Yet,
while PTCs are defined as any stop codon upstream of an
exon junction complex, NMD is functional in single exon
transcripts. Thus, while stop codons upstream of exon
junction complexes may trigger the NMD mechanism,
they are not the only stimulus. An alternative explanation
is that the distance between the stop codon and the polyA binding protein (PABP) is what triggers NMD, such
that increasing the distance between the stop codon and
the PABP increases the chance of NMD activation.
The NMD complex has been previously shown to be
functional in Giardia, although the precise means by
which transcripts lacking introns in Giardia are targeted
for degradation by the pathway has yet to be identified
[28,42]. These studies by Sun and colleagues identified 7
of 14 NMD associated factors by sequence similarity. The
putative homologs of the following NMD genes in Giardia
were identified: upf1, eRF1 and eRF3, sMG1, hrp1, xrn1
and xrn2, and ski7 (Additional File 2) [28].
eRF1p and eRF3p are eukaryotic release factors that
function in normal translation termination to remove the
ribosome from the mRNA [62]. The proteins Ef1ap,
eRF3p, Hbs1p, and Ski7p belong to the EF1 family, and
all possess elongation factor GTP binding domains
(Additional File 1). We believe that the proposed Ski7p
homolog was incorrectly identified by Sun and colleagues
and is actually the Giardia Hbs1p homolog. Amino acid
alignments indicate that the Giardia Hbs1 protein
sequence is approximately twice as similar to the S. cerevisiae eRF3 protein sequence as it is to the S. cerevisiae
Ski7 protein sequence (Figure 3). Additionally, Hbs1 proteins possess two translation factor domains, both of
which are absent from Ski7 (Additional File 1) and are
present in the proposed Giardia Ski7p protein. With the
alignment data, domain identification, and with the
knowledge that ski7 has only previously been found in
some Saccharomyces species [62], we believe that the
gene previously identified at ski7 is actually hbs1. However, the relationship between the members of the protein family make it likely that Ski7p and other EF1ap
homologs may be interchangeable in their functionality
in different eukaryotes, so that even without Ski7p,
mRNA quality control pathways such as NMD and NSD
may still remain functional [62].

Non-stop decay

Acting as a counterpoint to the NMD mechanism of RNA
degradation, and sharing some of the same protein
machinery, non-stop decay (NSD) is again translationdependent but is alternatively activated when the ribosome
fails to encounter a stop codon during translation of an
mRNA transcript [63,64]. In S. cerevisiae, the ribosome
continues reading into the poly-A tail and stalls at the end
of the transcript, followed by recruitment of Ski7p - and
possibly other proteins - to the ribosome. Given that Ski7p
has only been identified in a subset of Saccharomyces species, and a NSD-like mechanism has been functionally
identified in HeLa cells with the demonstration that an
mRNA transcript lacking a stop codon is degraded more
quickly than the same transcript with a stop codon [64], it
seems likely that machinery beyond Ski7 must be involved,
although the HeLa cell machinery responsible for nonstop
transcript degradation has not been identified. In Giardia
we identified proteins with sequence and domain similarity to eRF3p and Hbs1p along with two identical Ef1a
homologs. Since these proteins all share functional
domains with Ski7p (Additional Files 1 and 2), they may
possibly be able to trigger a NSD like mechanism in the
absence of Ski7p [62,64].
No-go decay

Like NMD and NSD, No-go decay (NGD) is also translation-dependent, but it is triggered when the ribosome
stalls upon encountering secondary structure in an mRNA
transcript. Stalling of the ribosome due to other mRNA
sequence-related factors can also induce NGD [65]. The
stalling of the ribosome causes the recruitment of
Dom34p and Hbs1p; Dom34p is a homolog of eRF1p,
while Hbs1p is a homolog of eRF3p; Endonucleolytic cleavage ensues and the two halves of the mRNA transcript
are degraded. Giardia possesses proteins with sequence
and domain similarity to both Dom34p and Hbs1p (Additional Files 1 and 2).
RNA interference machinery

The RNAi machinery consists of Dicer and Argonaute
proteins. Dicer possesses single Paz and RNase III
domains [66-68]. The guide strand of the dsRNA is loaded
into an Argonaute homolog that forms the RNA-induced
silencing complex (RISC) [66,67]. Argonaute homologs
contain one Piwi and one Paz domain each [68]; the Piwi
domain binds the RNA at its 3’ end, while the PAZ
domain possesses a nuclease-like activity that cleaves or
inhibits translation of the bound target mRNA transcript.
In some organisms, the dsRNA signal can be amplified
through the use of an RNA dependent RNA polymerase
(RdRP), which uses the Dicer product as a primer for subsequent dsRNA synthesis.
RNAi has been documented in a broad range of
eukaryotes such as T. brucei, Drosophila melanogaster,

H. sapiens, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe with roles in
gene silencing and heterochromatin formation [5,47].
However, RNAi machinery is absent from other eukaryotes such as P. falciparum and S. cerevisiae [68,69],
and in Toxoplasma gondii, the RNAi machinery has
resisted functional characterization [70]. Giardia’s RNAi
machinery has been previously well-characterized and
consists of an RdRP, Dicer and Argonaute homologs
[39,68,71] (Additional File 2). Knockdown of Giardia
RdRP or Dicer results in altered gene expression, especially concerning the variant surface proteins (VSP) on
the plasma membrane of trophozoites, while Argonaute
is an essential gene [39]. The observation of different
effects in Giardia depending on which gene in the
RNAi pathway is knocked down, leads us to believe that
some proteins in the pathway have roles in the cell
beyond that of just RNAi.

Discussion
The importance of RNA degradation is evident from the
multitude of pathways and mechanisms present in eukaryotic cells. RNA transcripts must be degraded to remove
both non-functional transcripts and transcripts that are
no longer needed for translation. Indeed, given the recent
discovery of the ubiquitous nature of transcription along
eukaryotic genomes [72], there is a rising appreciation
for the role of RNA degradation in the regulation of gene
expression. The exosome serves as a basic machinery of
RNA degradation in eukaryotic cells, but the complex
does not act alone. Additional complexes such as
TRAMP in the nucleus and NSD, NMD, and NGD in the
cytoplasm assist the exosome with degradation of mRNA
transcripts. Furthermore, complexes such as the RNAi
pathway degrade dsRNA into shorter transcripts that are
used for gene regulation and are not dependent on the

Williams and Elmendorf BMC Genomics 2011, 12:586
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/586

exosome for their function. The diversity of these complexes allows complete degradation of all RNA species
found in the cell.
In this study we used a bioinformatics approach to
investigate the exosome of the parasitic protists with a
special focus on the RNA degradation machinery of Giardia lamblia. Although our analyses described here specified only the Giardia Genome isolate, we found that
Giardia isolates P15 and GS possessed the same exosome
components as the Genome strain (data not shown). We
were able to identify several putative components of Giardia’s exosome, including four RNase PH proteins for the
ring of the exosome; Rrp4 and Rrp40, as stabilizing proteins for the ring structure; and lastly an Rrp44 homolog
that we predict possesses the requisite nucleolytic activity.
There are no trends in the expression patterns of proteins
from the different complexes, when looking at normal
growth and development, and also stress responses of
Giardia.
One of the most striking results of our research is the
detection of only four RNase PH proteins. Our findings
expand the repertoire of putative RNase PH proteins
beyond the two (A8BNT9/GL50803_1890 and C6LWS9/
GL50803_5632) identified through a bioinformatics analysis in a recent publication from Clayton and colleagues
[73]. The other paper did not define their search parameters in detail, and we suspect that the difference in our
findings is the consequence of more relaxed search parameters in the searches described in this paper. We stress,
however, that all four putative RNase PH proteins passed
a reciprocal BLASTp search test and contained either
strong consensus PH domains, or, in the case of
GL50803_9847, the more generic, but related COG2123
domain. Likewise, we identified four putative RNase PH
proteins in Plasmodium falciparum, one more than DeRisi
and colleagues identified [27], although the fourth one has
subsequently been identified in online databases. Given
the extreme sequence divergence that often characterizes
proteins in the parasitic protists compared to other eukaryotes, it is possible that an in silico approach is inadequate
to identify the full protein family. Indeed, this proved to be
the case in earlier studies in T. brucei, P. falciparum, and
C. reinhardti [24,27,74]. However, our search algorithm
was capable of detecting all six RNase PH domain proteins
in T. brucei, suggesting an enhanced sensitivity relative to
previous efforts. Thus, our inability to identify all exosome
components in Giardia and Plasmodium that were previously identified in S. cerevisiae and H. sapiens is likely
either the result of true gene absence or sequence divergence of the unidentified proteins. The Giardia genome
sequencing project has 11× coverage of the genome with
an estimated 96% of the genome sequenced [36], while the
P. falciparum sequencing project has a minimum of 9×
coverage for its chromosomes [75], further reducing the

Page 11 of 15

likelihood that genes could be missed because they are not
yet part of the genome database
If Giardia and Plasmodium are indeed limited to four
RNase PH proteins, this would mark a departure from the
typical eukaryotic exosome structure and suggests that
these proteins must be present in multiple copies within
the exosome ring in order for Giardia and Plasmodium to
have functional hexameric exosomes. We believe it unlikely that Giardia’s and P. falciparum’s exosomes differ
this dramatically from all other known exosome structures
in eukaryotes and archaea and from bacterial PNPase by
having fewer than six RNase PH subunits building the
exosome ring structure. The hexameric structure has been
conserved in all domains of life and is still the most likely
structure for Giardia and Plasmodium. Studies involving
C. reinhardtii demonstrate that absence of mtr3 exosome
component may be tolerated in some eukaryotes [74], providing some precedent to the scenario presented here.
Therefore, one central finding from our research is that
the core structure of the eukaryotic exosome may not be
universal, and the exosome may be able to be composed
of different combinations of Rrp41-like and Rrp42-like
proteins, with potential for different stoichiometric ratios
of the subunits. Unfortunately, the extreme sequence
divergence of the parasitic protist RNase PH domain proteins interferes with our ability to accurately classify them,
and we can therefore not be more specific in our description of the construction of the Giardia and Plasmodium
altered exosomes.
Additionally, our inability to identify a csl4 homolog is
initially striking since the archaeal exosome possesses a
csl4 homolog, and S. cerevisiae is nonviable in csl4 deletion
mutants [9]. However, T. brucei conditional mutants survive, with slowed growth rates, in the absence of the Csl4,
although exosome functionality was never determined in
the T. brucei Csl4 conditional mutants [24]. Tolerance of
deleted genes is likely different in every organism but
because Rrp4, Rrp40 and Csl4 all possess S1-like domains,
it seems likely that Rrp4 or Rrp40 may be able to act as a
replacement for Csl4.
Perhaps most surprisingly, while we were able to identify a likely Rrp44 homolog, we did not identify an Rrp6,
or indeed any RNase D-like, homolog. The absence of
Rrp6 appears to be specific only to Giardia since it was
found in the other parasitic protists we examined. Similar
studies of C. reinhardtii were also unable to identify an
Rrp6 homolog, but they were able to detect several putative open reading frames with homology to RNase D
domains [74] that likely serve as divergent substitutes. In
S. cerevisiae, Rrp6 is nuclear localized and acts to degrade
unstructured RNAs. In S. cerevisiae, deletion of Rrp6 is
tolerated, but cells display steady state increases in RNA
transcripts such as antisense and cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs) [76,77]. These transcripts are normally

Williams and Elmendorf BMC Genomics 2011, 12:586
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/586

produced but fail to accumulate to significant levels
because they are degraded by Rrp6 [76].
The absence of an Rrp6 homolog in Giardia is intriguing in light of the abundance of stable noncoding antisense transcripts in the parasite [37,38,78]. The Nab3 and
Nrd1 proteins were also unidentified. These proteins play
roles in maintaining undetectable levels of CUTs in S. cerevisiae [76,77]. CUTs and Giardia antisense transcripts
are similar because both can be produced from cryptic
promoter sequences in the genome or from bidirectional
transcription at defined promoters [38,76,77,79]. However,
Giardia’s antisense transcripts are quite different from
CUTs. CUTs are capped at their 5’ ends and are approximately 300 nucleotides or shorter in length [77]. Whereas
Giardia antisense transcripts are also capped at their
5’end, they can be thousands of nucleotides long and are
polyadenyated [25,37]. Perhaps, most importantly, Giardia’s antisense transcripts are apparently stable, long-lived
transcripts [37,78] and therefore, while cryptic, cannot
accurately be termed CUTs. We suggest that the absence
of Giardia’s Rrp6 and other proteins such as Nrd1 and
Nab3 [80,81] may play a role in the relative stability of
these antisense transcripts, an observation for which we
have previously been unable to provide a molecular
explanation.
If the exosome is independently incapable of recognizing
and degrading sterile transcripts in Giardia, we need to
look to the other exosome-dependent and exosome-independent machineries to serve this role. In particular, we
focus our attention on the cytoplasmic RNA degradation
machinery since recent evidence has shown that antisense
transcripts are exported from the nucleus into the cytoplasm in Giardia (Teodorovic and Elmendorf, in prep.).
The non-exosome RNA quality control machinery is also
ancient, with homologs in archaea: an EF1a homolog
(aEF1A), an eRF1 homolog (aRF1), and an eRF1 family
member (aDom34) [62,82,83]. Eukaryotes possess an
expanded EF1 family consisting of EF1a, eRF3, Hbs1, and
in some Saccharomyces species, Ski7. Interpreting the
function of this machinery is complicated, however, since
most of the protein components have dual roles in translation and in translation-dependent RNA quality control
pathways. Thus, although Giardia possesses a full complement of these proteins, other than Ski7, we can’t yet conclude that NSD and/or NGD are functional within the
parasite.

Conclusion
The key finding from this study is the identification of
RNA degradation pathways in a group of highly divergent
eukaryotes, the parasitic protists. These protists display
an unusual reluctance to regulate gene expression at the
transcriptional level, instead often engaging in promiscuous transcription and reliance on post-transcriptional

Page 12 of 15

regulation of gene expression. A better understanding of
the RNA degradation machinery in these parasitic protists provides us with the opportunity to answer intriguing basic molecular biology questions about the range
of structural variation that is permissible in a functional
eukaryotic exosome. Our research has revealed the surprising finding that the ‘canonical’ eukaryotic exosome
composition of six different RNasePH domain-containing
proteins (three Rrp41-like and three Rrp42-like subunits)
is not universal, and both Giardia and Plasmodium each
contain only four identifiable RNasePH domain-containing proteins, while Trichomonas contains a record
seventh protein. While a theme of ‘genomic minimalism’
has been identified previously in Giardia, our findings
presented here emphasize the extreme nature of this
mechanistic diminution.
Our research also helps us to understand the unusual
status of ncRNAs in Giardia. Our laboratory has previously published on the abundance and atypical stability
of long ncRNA transcripts in the parasite. While we have
now understood their origins for several years, we have
previously been unable to explain their stability. Our
detailed examination of the exosome in Giardia reveals
the absence of Rrp6 and Nab3-Nrd1, and that difference
may at last provide an explanation for this phenomenon.

Methods
Searching for degradation machinery of the RNA
exosome

Sequence similarity and protein domain searches were
performed to identify potential RNA degradation machinery components of the exosome in Giardia lamblia (WB),
Entamoeba histolytica (HM-1:IMSS), and Trichomonas
vaginalis (G3). Parallel searches were performed on organisms with previously identified exosome machinery (e.g.
Trypanosoma brucei (TREU), P. falciparum (3D7), Arabidopsis thaliana, and Homo sapiens) to validate the efficacy
of our search protocol.
We used S. cerevisiae RNA degradation machinery protein sequences as queries in our searches because many of
the yeast homologs have been verified functionally. When
putative homologs could not be identified using S. cerevisiae sequences, we additionally used human and T. brucei
RNA degradation machinery protein sequences as queries
in our searches. We performed initial searches using the
BLASTP algorithm with default search parameters against
deprecated and accepted open reading frames (ORFs) in
the parasite genomes available in the Eukaryotic Pathogen
Database Resource (EupathDB.org). The default parameters were set according to Washington University
BLASTP default parameters (cpus = 2, topcomboN = 1,
V = 100, B = 20, hspmax = 1000000, gi E = 1e-3, wordmask = seg, hspsepQmax = 4000, span1). For genes that
could not be identified using BLASTP alone, we used the

Williams and Elmendorf BMC Genomics 2011, 12:586
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/586

Interpro domain accessory function in the Giardia genome database (GiardiaDB.org) to search the genome with
PFAM domains or Conserved Domains that define the
RNA degradation machinery components. The domains
we searched for include the RNase PH (PF01138), AIR1
(COG5082), NOT1 (PF0454), NOT2_3_5 (PF04153),
NOT3 (PF04065), Exo_endo_phosph (PF03372), S1
(PF00575), KH (PF00013), Hit-like (PF01230), DCPS
(PF05652), DCP1 (PF06058), RCD (PF04078), and the
DNAQ_like_exo_superfamily domains.
Parameters for acceptance or refusal of queried results

When using BLASTP, acceptance of queried protein output was based on E-value (≤ 0.05) and the presence of
conserved RNA-binding or exonucleolytic protein
domains found in other eukaryotic homologs. For proteins
that were not conclusively identified in the initial search,
all ‘hits’, regardless of E-value, were examined for the presence of the conserved RNA-binding or exonucleolytic
protein domains when compared to the query sequence.
This flexible search protocol is often necessary in organisms as divergent as the parasitic protists examined here.
Parasite sequences at this stage were finally validated in a
reciprocal search against the S. cerevisiae genome at the
Saccharomyces Genome Database (yeastgenome.org).
Parasite genes that identified the initial S. cerevisiae search
sequence as the top hit were accepted as correct. The proteins in the resulting list were categorized and assigned to
protein complexes.
Amino acid alignments

All amino acid alignments were made using MUSCLE
3.8.31 [84] (parameters: gapopen -12.0, gapextend -1.0,
center at 0.0). The RNase PH protein alignments were
performed using a BLOSUM45 matrix, while all other
alignments were made using default parameters (PAM
200 scoring matrix). G-Blocks was used to exclude portions of the RNase PH amino acid sequences with limited
sequence similarity beyond the RNase PH domain [85,86].
G-Blocks settings were always set to the default parameters except for maximum number of contiguous nonconserved positions (10), minimum block length (4),

Protein Phylogenies

Amino acid alignments of the RNase PH proteins from
MUSCLE were used in the Phylip-3.69 package for the
production of gene trees. All programs mentioned below
are part of the Phylip-3.69 package [88]. Seqboot was used
to bootstrap the data set 100 times with block size set at 1
(regular boostrap). Next, Protpars was used to infer relatedness of the sequences to one another from analysis of

Page 13 of 15

the 100 data sets produced from Seqboot. Solfolobus solfataricus Rrp41 was set as the outgroup. Lastly the freeware
program Consense was used to produce the final gene
tree. The consensus type used was extended majority rule.
Extended majority rule allows groups of sequences that
appear in more than 50% of trees to be included in the
final tree and other sequences which fall below this level
are then added until all sequences are accounted for.
