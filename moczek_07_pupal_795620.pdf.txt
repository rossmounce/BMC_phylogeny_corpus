Abstract
Background: How novel morphological traits originate and diversify represents a major frontier
in evolutionary biology. Horned beetles are emerging as an increasingly popular model system to
explore the genetic, developmental, and ecological mechanisms, as well as the interplay between
them, in the genesis of novelty and diversity. The horns of beetles originate during a rapid growth
phase during the prepupal stage of larval development. Differential growth during this period is
either implicitly or explicitly assumed to be the sole mechanism underlying differences in horn
expression within and between species. Here I focus on male horn dimorphisms, a phenomenon at
the center of many studies in behavioral ecology and evolutionary development, and quantify the
relative contributions of a previously ignored developmental process, pupal remodeling, to the
expression of male dimorphism in three horned beetle species.
Results: Prepupal growth is not the only determinant of differences in male horn expression.
Instead, following their initial prepupal growth phase, beetles may be extensively remodeled during
the subsequent pupal stage in a sex and size-dependent manner. Specifically, male dimorphism in
the three Onthophagus species studied here was shaped not at all, partly or entirely by such pupal
remodeling rather than differential growth, suggesting that pupal remodeling is phylogenetically
widespread, evolutionarily labile, and developmentally flexible.
Conclusion: This study is the first to document that male dimorphism in horned beetles is the
product of two developmentaly dissociated processes: prepupal growth and pupal remodeling.
More generally, adult morphology alone appears to provide few clues, if any, as to the relative
contributions of both processes to the expression of alternative male morphs, underscoring the
importance of developmental studies in efforts aimed at understanding the evolution of adult
diversity patterns.

Background
Phenotypic diversity is produced by changes in ontogenetic processes occurring at earlier developmental stages.
Such changes may be brought about by allelic differences
among individuals, differences in ontogenetic environment, or as is probably the case for the majority of phenotypic traits, both. Evolutionary biologists are accustomed

to deducing ontogenetic properties based on ontogenetic
outputs rather than by studying development as a process.
For example, the degree of fluctuating asymmetry between
paired adult structures has been assumed by many studies
to be indicative of degree of developmental instability and
integration [1-3], even though few studies made the effort
to investigate the developmental underpinnings of asymPage 1 of 12

metry [4-6]. Comparative studies of scaling relationships
between adult body parts continue to be used heavily to
explore the ontogenetic basis of allometries and the evolution of shape [7-11], yet actual attempts to understand
formation and growth of said parts during ontogeny are
rare or absent. Similarly, considerable literature investigates the developmental costs of secondary sexual trait
expression based primarily or solely on examination of
adult individuals [12-15]. Here I explore the ontogenetic
basis of male horn polyphenism in three closely related
species of horn-dimorphic beetles and illustrate how relatively simple developmental studies can be sufficient to
advance a deeper understanding of how ontogeny mediates phenotypic evolution and diversification.
Diversity and biology of Onthophagus beetles
Onthophagus beetles have become a popular study system
for exploring the interplay between development and evolution during phenotypic diversification [reviewed in
[16,17]]. Horn expression in Onthophagus beetles varies
between species, populations, sexes, and alternative
morphs within sexes, with varying contributions of environmental and genetic factors on each of these levels. Species differ heritably in number, location, and shape of
horns [18-20]. Genetic differences also determine sexual
dimorphisms within the majority of species [13,21]. Typically, only males express fully developed horns while
females express no or greatly reduced horns [19]. Phenotypic diversity can be similarly extreme among males
within the same population, though here environmental
determination predominates. Only males that as larvae
have access to optimal feeding conditions eclose to large
body sizes and develop a full set of horns, while male larvae with access to sub-optimal feeding conditions eclose
to a smaller adult size and remain more female-like and
largely hornless [22-25]. The exact scaling relationship, or
allometry, between male horn length and body size can
differ dramatically between species in shape, slope, and
amplitude, and reflects evolved differences in scaling.
Consequently, phenotypic differences between large,
horned or "major" males and their smaller, hornless or
"minor" male counterparts may be more extreme in some
species than others. Lastly, scaling relationships may also
diverge within species where they can be affected by differences in population-wide environmental conditions
[26,27] or reflect genetic divergence in allopatry [28-30].
The present study focuses on the development and evolution of (i) thoracic and head horns, (ii) male dimorphisms in thoracic and head horn expression, and (iii)
interspecific differences in degree and kind of male dimorphism in three Onthophagus species with a conspicuous
male dimorphism.

Developmental basis of beetle horns
Beetle horns originate as epidermal outgrowths late in larval development during the prepupal stage [31]. At the
onset of the prepupal stage the larval epidermis lining the
larval cuticle detaches from the cuticle. Selected epidermal
regions then undergo rapid cell proliferation, causing epidermal tissue to become compacted and often folded
underneath the larval cuticle. Upon shedding the old larval cuticle the animal is then able to assume its pupal
shape, including expansion of pupal horn primordia, followed by hardening of the pupal cuticle over the next several hours. Prepupal horn growth is a dynamic and rapid
process and in some species 48 hours are sufficient to
transition from initial prepupal apolysis to pupal ecdysis
[31]. These dramatic shape changes not withstanding, the
development of beetle horns is in fact similar to that of
traditional appendages, such as legs, mouthparts, or
wings, in most holometabolous insects [31-34], with the
only exceptions occurring in the higher flies, the wings of
butterflies, and some beetles [reviewed in [35,36]]. Differences in degree of adult horn expression between or
within species has been taken implicitly or explicitly as
evidence of differential growth of these structures [8,1014,16,37-43]. Recent studies contradict this notion and
suggest that explosive growth in the prepupa may, at least
in some species, be followed by extensive remodeling of
morphology during the pupal stage, in some cases permitting the complete loss of horns and the metamorphosis of
a fully horned pupa into an entirely hornless adult
[17,21,31,44,45]. Here I investigate pupal remodeling of
horn expression in three Onthophagus species that have
been the subject of many previous studies because of their
pronounced male dimorphisms and quantify the contribution of pupal remodeling relative to differential prepupal growth in the development and evolution of intraand interspecific diversity.

Results
In O. nigriventris, scaling relationships between body size
and horn length changed significantly from the pupal to
the adult stage (Fig. 2A). Specifically, both amplitude and
steepness of the slope increased significantly from the
pupal to the adult stage, creating a greater and more sudden disparity between minor and major male morphs
(amplitude: T64 = 2.76, p = 0.0075; slope: T64 = 2.53, p =
0.0139). Both relative and absolute loss of horn length
decreased quickly with male size (Fig. 2B, Frel = 127; p <
0.0001; Fabs = 42; p < 0.0001). Small males commonly lost
>1 mm (> 20%) of horn length compared to ~0.25 mm (<
5%) in large males. Log-log plots of pupal against adult
horn length showed that hornless, minor males fell below
the line expected if adult horn length was a direct, unaltered reflection of pupal horn length (indicated by gray
line in Fig. 2C), whereas horned, major males appeared
right on that line. This observation was backed up by

regression analysis, which yielded a negative y-intercept
significantly different from 0 (T32 = 18.95, p < 0.0001),
confirming that horn lengths of at least some males
decreased from the pupal to the adult stage, and with a
slope highly significantly greater than 1 (Fig. 2C; T32 =
14.63; p < 0.0001), supporting that this decrease was
strongest for small males.
In O. taurus, scaling relationships between body size and
horn length did not change significantly from the pupal to
the adult stage (Fig. 3A). Neither amplitude nor steepness
of the slope increased significantly from the pupal to the
adult stage. However, both relative and absolute loss of
horn length still showed a significant effect of body size.
As with O. nigriventris, relative horn loss decreased rapidly
with male size (Fig. 3B, Frel = 110; p < 0.0001), however,
absolute horn loss first increased, reaching a peak in
medium-sized males (x0 = 4.83 Â± 0.027 mm; p = 0.0001),
before declining again to near zero values in large males
(Fabs = 28.37; p < 0.0001). As with O. nigriventris, log-log
plots of pupal against adult horn length yielded a negative
y-intercept (T51 = 21.98, p < 0.0001) and a slope highly
significantly greater than 1 (Fig. 3C; T51 = 14.96; p <
0.0001). Also as before, hornless, minor males fell below
the line expected if adult horn length was a direct reflection of pupal horn length whereas horned, major males
appeared right on that line.

(minor) males (bottom) as pupae (left) and corresponding

In the third species, O. binodis, results were yet again different. The scaling relationships between body size and
horn length changed significantly from the pupal to the
adult stage, however, unlike the previous two species all
adults beetles had much shorter horns then their corresponding pupae regardless of final body size (Fig. 4A). As
a consequence, y-intercepts of linear regressions on pupal
and adult allometries differed significantly (T98 = 31.1, p <
0.0001). More importantly, allometric slopes also
changed significantly, but in a direction opposite to that
observed in the previous two species. Adult O. binodis had
a slightly but significantly shallower slope than the pupae
from which they had eclosed (T98 = 2.64, p = 0.0098). Loss
of horn tissue also showed a pattern different from that
observed in O. nigriventris or O. taurus (Fig. 4B). Specifically, relative horn loss only showed a very moderate, if
any, decrease with adult size (Frel = 4.8; p = 0.033; ns after
corrections for multiple comparisons). In contrast, absolute horn loss exhibited a moderate, yet significant,
increase with adult size (Fabs = 11.25; p = 0.0016). Log-log
plots of pupal against adult horn length yielded a negative
y-intercept significantly different from 0 (T49 = 4.38, p <
0.0001), further confirming that horn lengths changed
from the pupal to the adult stage, but with a slope indistinguishable from 1 (Fig. 4C; T49 = 1.026; p = ns), indicating that this change was similar for all males regardless of
their size. Combined, these data suggest that pupal

remodeling does affect male shape but not male dimorphism in this species. Most strikingly, however, this analysis failed to support the existence of a male dimorphism
in horn expression in the first place, even though this species has been the subject of several previous studies into
the biology of alternative male morphs [4,5,15]. To help
resolve this contradiction I measured adults using the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/151

same landmarks used by previous studies, as illustrated in
Figure 5 (J. Tomkins, pers. communication). Rather than
using the scutellum as a posterior boundary, earlier studies used an imaginary line drawn perpendicular to the
body axis at the level of two lateral concavities (Î¼ in Fig.
5B), or depressions, that characterize the adult prothorax.
No such concavities exist in pupae and this measurement

horn length measurement used by previous studies, which relies on Î¼ as the posterior landmark, marked by the posteriormost edge of the two lateral prothoracic depressions. (C) Use of Î¼ as posterior landmark, and b as a measure of horn length,
recovers a male horn dimorphism in O. binodis adults similar to what has been documented in earlier studies. (D) Scaling relationship between c (which measures the proportion of the prothorax that does not participate in concavity formation) and
adult male size. c initially increases with male size and then declines rapidly in large males, suggesting that large males devote a
disproportionately larger fraction of their lateral prothorax toward exposing the medial thoracic horn (solid line = log normal
regression: r2 = 0.42, p < 0.0001; in contrast a linear regression (not shown) fails to yield a significant fit; r2 = 0.06; p = ns).
Combined, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that dimorphic remodeling of the lateral prothorax during the
pupal stage, rather than dimorphic growth of actual horn tissue during the prepupal stage, generates male dimorphism in O. binodis. To increase statistical power data shown in (C) and (D) include an additional 23 male O. binodis reared under identical
conditions excpet that no measurements were taken during the pupal stage.

can only be made on adults. Use of this alternative posterior landmark recovered a dimorphic scaling relationship
very similar to those published previously (Fig. 5C). This
suggested that male dimorphism in O. binodis may not be
a function of horn growth per se, but rather a function of
the degree to which lateral aspects of the pupal prothorax
retract, or "cave in", around the medial prothorax. To further examine this possibility, I calculated the length of the
part of the thorax, c, that was unaffected by lateral concavity formation for each individual (Fig. 5b). If lateral concavity formation is independent of body size, i.e. the same
proportion of the prothorax participates in concavity formation regardless of final adult size, then c should
increase isometrically with male size. In contrast, if large,
major males have larger horns because the lateral prothorax is further caved-in than in small males, c should scale
with body size with a slope < 1, and possibly even a negative slope. In support of the latter hypothesis, c was
found to first increase and reach a peak in medium-sized
males size before declining again rapidly in larger males
(Fig. 5D; log normal regression: r2 = 0.42, p < 0.0001). In
contrast, a linear regression of c on body size failed to
yield a significant fit (r2 = 0.06; p = ns). Separating small
and large males in the analysis further confirmed this
observation. c was found to increase significantly with
body size in males less than 6.4 mm in thorax width (F =
42.74; p < 0.0001), but to decrease significantly with body
size in males larger than that (F = 12.72; p < 0.001). This
supports the hypothesis that male dimorphism found in
O. binodis is not the product of dimorphic growth of horn
tissue but instead results from body size-dependent caving-in, or retracting, of the lateral prothorax, exposing a
relatively larger thoracic projection in large males compared to their smaller male counterparts.

Discussion
Onthophagus beetles have emerged as a promising model
system for exploring the interplay between genetic, developmental, and ecological factors in the genesis of phenotypic diversity [16,17,21,46]. Part of their attractiveness
stems from the enormous morphological diversity in secondary sexual traits found between species, sexes, and
alternative morphs within sexes, providing opportunities
to explore, within a very narrow phylogenetic distance,
topics such as the costs and limits of trait elaboration
[8,23], developmental and life-history tradeoffs related to
secondary sexual trait expression [10-12,43], or the frequency of independent evolutionary events necessary to
explain extant patterns of diversity [13,14]. Importantly,
the majority of earlier studies implicitly or explicitly
assumed that the expression of secondary sexual traits in
adult beetles is the consequence of differential activation
of growth of these structures during immature development [8,10-12,16,37-40,42,43]. Here I present results on
the developmental origin of alternative male dimorphism

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/151

in three Onthophagus species that may help refine this
assumption.
In two of the three species studied here, O. nigriventris and
O. taurus, pupal remodeling of horn length occurred in a
size dependent manner. Smaller and medium sized-males
lost both relatively and absolutely greater amounts of
horn tissue compared to their larger male counterparts,
causing males to change pupal to adult proportions in a
size dependent manner. In large males of both species,
pupal proportions were largely maintained in the eclosing
adults, whereas smaller and medium-sized males were
more extensively remodeled. In O. nigriventris, sizedependent pupal remodeling of male horn length significantly altered the scaling relationship between horn
length and body size, causing adult allometries to exhibit
greater disparity between alternative male morphs and to
transition from one morph to the other over a narrower
range of body sizes compared to the pupae from which
they eclosed. Allometric differences in O. taurus were in
the same direction as in O. nigriventris but were not significant. Overall, however, loss of pupal horn tissue, and
remodeling of pupal proportions prior to adult eclosion,
were considerably less severe than what has been previously documented for female Onthophagus and the development of sexual dimorphisms, where in many cases fully
horned pupae have been shown to molt into entirely
hornless adults lacking any indication of the earlier existence of a horn [21,44,45]. These results suggest that pupal
remodeling can play a moderate, but not dominant, role
in the development of some male dimorphisms. Specifically, in species in which prepupal horn growth is already
dimorphic, pupal remodeling appears to have the capacity
to further exaggerate male dimorphism. Furthermore,
given that the relative loss of horn tissue was highest in
small to medium-sized males, pupal remodeling in these
species also has the potential to further reduce the production of intermediate morphologies from the population
of phenotypes generated by dimorphic growth alone.
Results in the third species, O. binodis, however, suggest an
additional dimension to the role of pupal remodeling.
Initial results suggested that pupal remodeling of horn
length also occurs in this species, causing pupal proportions to change as pupae become adults, but without a
strong dependence on adult size. Instead, pupal horn
length changed similarly in all males regardless of final
size. Most importantly, however, horn length-body size
measurements failed to reveal an actual male dimorphism
in both pupae and adults, even though this species has
been studied in detail for its male dimorphism by previous studies [10,13,37,38,43], and visual inspection of
specimens leaves the strong impression of a significant
discontinuity in horn expression when comparing males
of different body sizes. Repeat measurements of the same

individuals using the same posterior landmark used in
earlier studies recovers a male dimorphism similar to
what has been previously documented [43]. This alternative, original landmark is formed by two lateral concavities, or depressions of the prothorax, and an imaginary
line that can be drawn perpendicular to the body axis at
the level of the posterior-most extent of these depressions
(Fig. 5), whereas the landmark used initially in this study
was formed by the posterior border of the horn-bearing
segment, the prothorax. The crucial difference between
these two measurements lies in the fact that if horn length
is measured using the lateral concavities as a landmark,
length of horns becomes a function of not only the extent
to which the horn extends forward, but also of the degree
to which the lateral depression indent the prothorax.
Measuring horn length using the posterior edge of the
prothorax as a boundary is independent of the presence or
absence of lateral depressions. Subsequent analysis
showed that large males indeed allocate much larger proportions of their prothorax to the formation of lateral concavities compared to males of smaller body sizes (Fig.
5D). The complete absence of these concavities in pupae
suggests that male dimorphism in O. binodis is not the
product of dimorphic prepupal growth of horn tissue but
instead may result entirely from body size-dependent caving-in, or retracting, of the lateral pupal prothorax, which
ultimately exposes a much larger thoracic horn in large
males compared to their smaller male counterparts. More
generally, this suggests that dimorphisms, such as those
found in O. binodis, do not necessarily require dimorphic
growth of the trait of interest, but may be generated partly
or entirely by dimorphic remodeling, or sculpting, of the
surrounding body regions.
The developmental basis of pupal horn remodeling
Recent studies on pupal remodeling of female horn
expression implicate the local activation of programmed
cell death as the most likely proximate mechanism underlying pupal remodeling [[21]; T. Kijimoto, J. Andrews, and
A. Moczek unpublished). Programmed cell death (PCD)
is a basic physiological process used by all metazoan
organisms to remove superfluous or harmful cells and to
sculpt organs and body parts during morphogenesis. PCD
relies on a tier of phylogenetically highly conserved
genetic and developmental processes [47-49], and is executed via apoptosis or autophagy, two processes that differ
primarily in the mechanisms used for degradation of the
dying cell [50]. In holometabolous insects, PCD-mediated sculpting of pupal body parts is essential to attain
their final adult shape and function [51,52]. In extreme
cases PCD can even mediate the whole sale loss of entire
structures, such as caste-specific degeneration of prepupal
wing discs in Pheidole ants [53] or sex-specific apoptotic
wing degeneration during pupal development of some
Lepidoptera [54,55]. In Onthophagus, PCD-mediated loss

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/151

of horn tissue has been implicated in the production of
sexual dimorphism via sex-specific removal of entire
pupal horns in a number of species [21] and PCD-mediated removal of horn tissue is also a likely mechanism
underlying the more subtle pupal remodeling of horn
length reported here for O. nigriventris and O. taurus.
Pupal remodeling in O. binodis, however, is likely to
require additional mechanisms beyond the simple
removal of horn tissue through PCD. Specifically, it is difficult to envision how the lateral concavity formation
observed in O. binodis can be achieved through the simple
removal of epidermal cells, as the surface area generated
by these concavities appears similarly large, if not larger
than the corresponding, initial surface area in the pupal
stage. Rather than requiring the removal of tissue, the formation of concavities is likely to require local changes in
the orientation and shape of epidermal cells to generate
epidermal infolding, similar to what has been documented for the early formation of joints in Drosophila
appendages [35]. If correct, this would suggests that the
formation of lateral concavities in O. binodis does not
actually free up resources that could be allocated elsewhere, as would be the case with pupal remodeling mediated purely by PCD, but instead would require additional
resources to alter shape and orientation of cells. Studies
are now under way documenting and quantifying changes
in cell shape and orientation during the pupal remodeling
stage of horn development. However, independent of
exactly which developmental processes mediate pupal
remodeling, it already appears clear that they must be able
to do so in a sex-, size, and location-specific manner. Preliminary observations implicate juvenile hormone (JH),
Insulin (IN), and Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor
(EGFR) signaling in the regulation of degree and location
of PCD and cell shape changes in pupal horns (T. Kijimoto, J. Andrews, A. Moczek, unpublished). All three pathways are well known for their important roles in the
regulation of organ and body size in a wide range of
organisms [42,56,57] and experiments are under way to
explore the roles of JH, In, and EGFR-signaling during
pupal remodeling through comparative gene expression
assays as well as functional analysis.

Conclusion
The data presented here illustrate that alternative male
morphologies, at least among the three Onthophagus species studied here, are shaped by a minimum of two developmentally dissociated processes: growth of horn tissue
during the prepupal stage, followed by remodeling during
the pupal stage. In species in which prepupal horn growth
is already dimorphic, pupal remodeling appears to have
the capacity to further exaggerate male dimorphism and
selectively remove intermediate phenotypes from the distribution of phenotypes generated by prepupal growth
alone. In contrast, in species such as O. binodis male

dimorphism may not require dimorphic prepupal growth
and instead may be shaped entirely by dimorphic pupal
remodeling. Most importantly, adult morphology alone
appears to provide few clues, if any, as to the relative contributions of prepupal growth and pupal remodeling to
the expression of alternative male morphs, thus underscoring the importance of developmental studies in
efforts aimed at understanding the evolution of adult
diversity patterns.

Species choice and husbandry
I investigated the relative contribution of pupal remodeling in the development and evolution of sexual dimorphisms by quantifying ontogenetic changes in the
allometric scaling between body size and horn length
from the pupal to the adult stage and the degree to which
ontogenetic changes in allometries differed between
males as a function of body size. In particular, I examined
the ontogeny of male horn dimorphism in three species
(Fig. 1). Large adult male O. nigriventris express an enormous thoracic horn, whereas small males express only a
small pointy thoracic projection. The transition from
small to large horns occurs over a very narrow range of
body sizes [58]. O. binodis exhibits the same general pattern, though horn size and degree of male dimorphism
are considerably reduced compared to O. nigriventris
[37,38]. Lastly, large male O. taurus express two head
horns while smaller males remain female-like and largely
hornless [59]. Males of all three species use their horns in
male fights over access to females, where they function as
jousting devices during head-to-head combat and to block
entrances to breeding tunnels [38,58,60].

Laboratory colonies of all three species were derived from
field populations. O. taurus was collected from pastures
around Bloomington, IN, and O. nigriventris and O. binodis were collected from pastures near Waimea, Hawaii. All
species were maintained and reared as described previously [44]. Early third instar larvae of each species were
transferred from their natural brood ball into 12-well
plates to monitor larval development as described previously [61]. First to second-day pupae were measured,
weighed, and then returned to their artificial brood ball
until adult eclosion. At this stage the pupal epidermis still
fully lined the pupal cuticle (Moczek, unpublished) and
pupal size measurements are therefore a direct reflection
of growth completed prior to the pupal stage. Eclosing
adults were retained in brood balls for an additional 3â4
days to allow the adult cuticle to fully harden, then
weighed, killed, stored in ethanol, and re-measured as
described below.

Morphometric measurements
Pupae and adults of all three species were measured as
described in Moczek [21]. To summarize, pupal and adult
thorax width was used as a proxy for body size (for justification see [22,25]. Head horn length in O. taurus was
measured along the outer edge of one horn beginning at
the edge of the eye cavity and ending at the tip of the horn.
Thoracic horn length in O. binodis and O. nigriventris was
measured as the distance from the anterior-most point of
the prothorax, or "tip" of the horn, to the posterior-most
point of the prothorax bordering anteriorly to the scutellum of the second thoracic segment. Measuring horns in
this fashion allowed me to unambiguously recognize
homologous landmarks in both pupae and adults [21].
For comparison, and to examine possible effects of measurement technique, thoracic horns in O. binodis were also
measured using a partly different set of landmarks, as in
earlier studies [10,13,43]. In these studies O. binodis horn
length was measured as the linear distance from the tip of
the horn to an imaginary line drawn across the prothorax
(perpendicular to the body axis) at the level of two lateral
prothoracic concavities present in adult males (J. Tomkins, personal communication; indicated in Fig. 1c and
5b). No corresponding landmark exists in pupae and this
measurement is therefore restricted to adults. To increase
sample size and statistical power in the analysis of adult
scaling relationships in O. binodis I included measurements of an additional 23 adult males. Males in this additional sample were reared under identical conditions
except that no measurements were taken while they were
in the pupal stage.
Statistical analyses
Pupal and adult scaling relationships were contrasted by
fitting 4-parameter non-linear regression models (O.
nigriventris and O. taurus) or simple linear regression models (O. binodis) to the data. Pupae are consistenly about
5% larger (in thorax width) than the adults that emerge
from them, regardless of sex or species [21]. Pupal and
adult scaling relationships were therefore contrasted in
two ways, first using untransformed body size measurements, and then again using body size values transformed
to standard deviations away from the mean body size. The
later comparison was also used to graphically contrast
pupal and adult scaling relationships because it centers
scaling relationships onto the mean body size characteristic of each developmental stage. I then used T-tests to
examine the degree to which possible differences between
pupal and adult scaling relationships could be explained
by particular regression parameters. Specifically, I examined whether pupal and adult scaling relationships differed in (i) the range of horn expression, or amplitude,
which can be interpreted as a measure of the disparity
between morphs achievable over a given range of body
sizes, and (ii) the steepness of the allometric slope, which

can be interpreted as a measure of body size range necessary to achieve the transition from one morph to the
other. All analyses were conducted using both untransformed and transformed body size values. To further characterize nature and mechanisms of pupal remodeling I
then quantified relative loss of pupal horn length (calculated as the percentage of pupal horn length not retained
in the adult) and absolute loss of pupal horn length (calculated as the absolute difference between pupal and
adult horn length) for each individual as a function of
body size using standard linear regressions. Lastly, to further explore the significance of such changes I regressed
log-transformed pupal against adult horn lengths. If adult
horn length is a direct reflection of pupal horn length
regardless of male size then the slope of such a log-log
plot should be 1 with an intercept of 0. If horn length
decreases from the pupa to adult by the same magnitude
for each individual this should cause the slope to remain
1, but the intercept to become negative. Lastly, if males
differ in how they convert pupal to adult horn length as a
function of their body size this would be manifest in a
change in the slope from 1. I used T-tests to determine
whether slopes or intercepts differend significantly from 1
or 0, respectively. I used sequential Bonferroni procedures
to correct for multiple comparisons within and between
species where this was necessary.
