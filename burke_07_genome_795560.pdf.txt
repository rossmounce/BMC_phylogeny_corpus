Abstract
Background: Genome-wide association studies of common diseases for common, low
penetrance causal variants are underway. A proportion of these will alter protein sequences, the
most common of which is the non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (nsSNP). It would
be an advantage if the functional effects of an nsSNP on protein structure and function could be
predicted, both for the final identification process of a causal variant in a disease-associated
chromosome region, and in further functional analyses of the nsSNP and its disease-associated
protein.
Results: In the present report we have compared and contrasted structure- and sequence-based
methods of prediction to over 5500 genes carrying nearly 24,000 nsSNPs, by employing an
automatic comparative modelling procedure to build models for the genes. The nsSNP information
came from two sources, the OMIM database which are rare (minor allele frequency, MAF, < 0.01)
and are known to cause penetrant, monogenic diseases. Secondly, nsSNP information came from
dbSNP125, for which the vast majority of nsSNPs, mostly MAF > 0.05, have no known link to a
disease. For over 40% of the nsSNPs, structure-based methods predicted which of these sequence
changes are likely to either disrupt the structure of the protein or interfere with the function or
interactions of the protein. For the remaining 60%, we generated sequence-based predictions.
Conclusion: We show that, in general, the prediction tools are able distinguish disease causing
mutations from those mutations which are thought to have a neutral affect. We give examples of
mutations in genes that are predicted to be deleterious and may have a role in disease. Contrary
to previous reports, we also show that rare mutations are consistently predicted to be deleterious
as often as commonly occurring nsSNPs.

Background
The recent sequencing of the human genome has provided a wealth of information detailing several million

genetic variations between individuals. This offers new
opportunities for identifying the genetic predisposition to
and understanding the causes of common diseases. It has

been estimated that 90% of genetic variations in humans
are due to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) [1],
most of which have minor allele frequencies exceeding
0.05 and will provide a significant proportion of common
causal variants that will be mapped and identified in the
future. Through the HapMap project over 4 million of
these have been genotyped in a common panel of DNA
samples, not only validating the SNP and estimating its
allele frequency in the general population, but also assessing the degree of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between
them [2,3]. Moreover, SNP genotyping technologies have
advanced recently to the point that hundreds of thousands of SNPs can be typed in thousands of individuals,
for example using the case-control design [4]. Hence, the
discovery of causal variants for common diseases is set to
accelerate and it would be advantageous if the functional
effects of SNPs could be predicted bioinformatically, in
order to direct functional studies and narrow down the
best candidate SNPs in regions of the genome that show
high LD.
The most identifiable category of SNP is the small proportion (less than 1%) that change protein sequence, the
most common of which is the non-synonymous SNP.
There are now several databases that catalogue these variations, such as the human genome variation database,
HGVBase, [5,6] and the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database of SNPs, dbSNP [7,8].
Most of these sequence variations have been identified by
sequencing and genotyping DNA samples from general
populations rather than disease groups, most particularly
in the HapMap project [2], and using the new genotyping
technologies panels of genome-wide nsSNPs are now
being studied in disease and control populations [4,9,10].
The Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) [11,12]
collates known gene mutations responsible for human
inherited disease. Similarly, the genetic association database (GAD) [13] has archived over 3,600 dbSNP and
HGVBase entries that have reported disease associations
from published clinical studies, although very few of these
statistical associations are validated. The Mendelian
Inheritance in Man (MIM) database is a catalogue of
genetic disorders of inherited diseases mapped to human
genes and highly penetrant, but rare (MAF < 0.01) mutations [14,15].
Knowledge of the three dimensional structure of a gene
product is of major assistance in predicting and understanding its function, its role within the cell and its role in
disease. Over the past few years, there have been many
computational methods developed to predict whether a
mutation is deleterious to the structure or the function of
the gene and will therefore lead to disease. In general,
these classify the mutations into whether they have negative, neutral or positive effects on the structure or function

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/301

of the proteins. There are several methods that try to estimate loss (or gain) in energy of the protein structure due
to single sequence changes. The method developed by
Topham and colleagues, Site Directed Mutator (SDM), is
based upon environment substitutions using an analogy
to the thermodynamic cycle [16]. The Mupro method [17]
uses support vector machine learning to predict protein
stability changes for single amino acid mutations using
both sequence and structural information, as does the IMutant2.0 method [18,19].
Several methods use sequence conservation of particular
amino acids within a family of sequences or look for particular features of a protein structure to predict whether a
substitution affects protein function. For example, SIFT
(Sorts Intolerant From Tolerant substitutions) [20-22]
distinguishes those residues that are conserved amongst
homologous sequences, and, thus, intolerant to most
sequence changes, from those residues that are poorly
conserved and tolerant to sequence changes. SIFT does
not require structural information and, therefore, can be
applied to protein sequences in general.
Another resource, the LS-SNP database [23,24], contains
predictions based on machine learning techniques, of
whether a nsSNP will have an effect on protein-ligand
binding or have a deleterious impact the function of the
protein and would thus lead to disease. The current
release of LS-SNP (2005-09-02) predicts that, out of
nearly 21,000 nsSNPs extracted from dbSNP, over 4,700
(22%) of the nsSNPs will destabilize protein structure or
interfere with either ligand binding or the formation of
domain-domain interfaces [23]. Predictions of the
POLYPHEN method are based on empirical rules based
on the sequence, phylogenetic and structural information
characterizing the substitution [25-27]. Ramensky et al.
predicted that 25% (2,848 out of 11,152) of the nsSNPs
from HGVBase (version 12) would be damaging [26].
Functional information, detailing which residues are
involved in catalysis, binding of ligands or interactions
with other proteins, is sometimes available in databases
or in the literature. The Catalytic Site Atlas [28] details residues involved in enzyme catalysis for nearly 15,000 proteins based on over 700 literature reports. Many
computational methods for the prediction of which residues may be involved in function have also been developed [29-32]. A widely used computational technique to
predict functional residues, based upon the evolutionary
conservation of sequences, is the "evolutionary trace"
method [33-35]. In this technique, phylogenetic information based on homologous sequences is used to rank residues by evolutionary importance which are conserved in
a protein sequence. This conservation can then be
mapped onto a representative structure. Clusters of con-

served residues in three dimensions can detect functional
surfaces such as those involved in protein-protein interactions. The 3DCA method [29] extended this to identify
spatial clusters of residues that are more conserved in
sequence than expected given their overall sequence identity. However, the conservation of amino acid residues has
been shown to be strongly dependent on the environment
in which they occur in the protein structure [36,37]. Methods that use conservation of sequence do not exclusively
distinguish between evolutionary restraints arising from
the need to conserve function, from those that arise from
the conservation of the structural environment. Since the
core of the protein is likely to be conserved for structural
reasons, these methods often only consider residues on
the surface of the protein. This approach is particularly
problematic for catalytic residues of enzymes, which can
often be relatively inaccessible to solvent.
The Crescendo method identifies those residues that have
a higher degree of conservation than would be expected
on the basis of the local structural environment [30]. It is
assumed that these additional restraints on allowed
amino acid substitutions are due to particular functions
mediated by interactions with other molecules. Once
potential functional residues have been identified, known
mutations can be mapped onto the structure of the protein, if known, and a prediction can be made of their effect
on function. For instance, if a residue is a known catalytic

residue or is close to a known binding site, mutations of
this residue are likely to affect function.
In the present report we detail the large-scale automated
homology modelling of 6,000 genes that were selected by
us as functional candidate genes in immune-mediated
disease and the subsequent analysis of 24,000 nsSNPs
found within these genes. The goal of the analysis is to
predict a subset of mutations which are likely to affect the
structure or function of the gene, and thus to identify
which of these mutations may have a role in the progression or development of inflammatory or immune diseases.

Results
Genome-wide prediction of protein structure
Table 1 shows a summary of available databases detailing
sequence variation in the human genome. Two datasets of
nsSNPs were selected and analysed, 2,249 sequence
changes found in 500 genes in OMIM and 21,471 nsSNPs
in 5,500 genes from dbSNP125. It is well acknowledged
that buried residues tend to be more conserved in evolution and mutations of these residues would be expected
have a marked effect of the structure of the protein, resulting in an increased risk of causing disease. Nevertheless,
residues on the surface of the protein are more likely to be
involved in protein-protein or protein-ligand interactions.
Unfortunately, structural information is usually restricted

to a small proportion of the genes for which experimental
crystal structures have being determined. To increase the
coverage of structural information for these genes, we
implemented an automated, large-scale, structure prediction strategy using homology modelling. This technique
requires a prior prediction of the likely fold of the protein,
often termed homology or fold recognition.
Automated homology recognition for all of the genes was
performed using FUGUE [38,39]. The average length of
the protein sequence within the list of genes is 400 residues with more than 95% of the sequences having fewer
than 1,000 amino acids. A few genes are exceptionally
long, such as the SYNE1 gene (nuclear envelope spectrin
repeat protein), which contains over 8,800 amino acids.
Figure 1 shows the distribution of the number of HOMSTRAD [40] families per gene that were predicted by
FUGUE. Surprisingly, only 661 (12%) of the genes had no
significant FUGUE prediction (Z-score < 7). There was a
single HOMSTRAD family predicted for 2,727 (~50%) of

the genes. This does not imply a single structural domain
within the genes since some of the HOMSTRAD families
represent multiple structural domains. Two HOMSTRAD
families, and thus multiple domains, were predicted in
1,117 (~20%) of the genes and three families for 551
(~10%) of the genes. More than 99% of the sequence
alignments produced by FUGUE have a length of less than
500 residues.
Homology recognition of protein sequences
Over 16,000 models were built for over 4,700 genes that
had significant FUGUE scores, using the program Modeller[41-43]. For 37% of the genes, there were multiple
FUGUE scores representing multiple structural domains
in the gene. In these cases models representing each structural domain were built with no attempt to join these into
a single model for the gene. The percentage of sequence
variations for which a structure can be predicted varied
between the two datasets. Over 62% of mutations from
the OMIM (1,403 nsSNPs in 375 genes) were in a region

of the gene with a structure prediction in contrast to only
51% of the dbSNP (11009 nsSNPs in 3,956 genes).

total number of nsSNPs analysed for each method is summarised in table 2.

The relative solvent accessible area (ASA) was calculated
for all residues in the models. Over 58% of the amino
acids with structures that have OMIM mutations are buried (<40% ASA), compared to only 40% of the mutations
in dbSNP. These mutations would, therefore, be expected
to affect the structure or folding of the proteins. These values are in good agreement with a smaller study of 63 crystal structures of human proteins with disease causing
mutations [44]. It would also suggest that 40% of the
OMIM mutations are exposed to solvent and may disrupt
protein interactions rather than disrupt the structure or
folding of the protein. On the contrary, most of the mutations in dbSNP, which are expected to have a neutral effect
on the structure and function of the protein, tend to occur
on the surface of the protein where amino acid substitutions are more readily accommodated.

Cross-referencing the pre-computed LS-SNP predictions,
we find LS-SNP predictions for 52% (11220 nsSNPs in
2381 genes) of our dbSNP dataset. In total 10% (2,291
nsSNPs in 1,511 genes) are predicted to affect either the
structure or function of the gene. Polyphen predictions
were only available for 21% of dbSNP (4,459 nsSNPs in
2,237 genes). Just under 25% of these predictions (1,141
nsSNPs in 845 genes), or 5% of the total, were predicted
to be damaging. Less than 3% of the SNPs (549 nsSNPs in
367 genes) have both LS-SNP and Polyphen predictions.
Both methods agree on a deleterious prediction for only
1% of the dbSNP (225 nsSNPs in 203 genes). There was
no data available for the sequence variations in the OMIM
for either LS-SNP or Polyphen.

Prediction of deleterious mutations
Although several methods are available for prediction of
functionality, they are mostly not readily usable for the
large number of nsSNPs in genome-wide analysis. Generally, only a small number of the published predictions
correspond to the mutations found in our datasets. We
have, therefore, focused only on methods for which we
could either download pre-computed predictions for a
large proportion of our datasets or where we were able to
implement the methods in-house. These methods and the

When Ng and Henikoff applied SIFT to a set of nsSNPs
annotated in SWISS-PROT, 69% (3,626/5,218) were correctly predicted as damaging [45]. SIFT also predicted that
25% of the sequence variations in dbSNP will affect protein function. However, they estimated the false positive
rate to be 20%, suggesting that most nsSNPs in dbSNP are
functionally neutral. We applied the SIFT algorithm to our
datasets using the sequence alignments generated from
the FUGUE fold recognition algorithm. Nearly 51% of the
nsSNPs in OMIM (1,138 nsSNPs in 330 genes) were predicted to be deleterious. This is lower than Ng and
Henikoffs original estimate for disease related mutations.

which is mutated, Arg191, is show is ball-and-stick representation.

This difference is in part due to the use of FUGUE derived
sequence alignments, which generally produces more
accurate sequence alignments than most methods. Additionally, the number and divergence (and hence sequence
conservation) of homologous sequences has increased
since their original study. Both of these factors will help to
reduce false positive predictions. In agreement with their
original study, we find that 25% of nsSNPs from
dbSNP(5,506 nsSNPs in 2,766 genes) are predicted to be
deleterious. Comparing these predictions with other
methods may prove useful in further removing false positive predictions. Almost one sixth, or 4% of mutations in
dbSNP (851 nsSNPs in 651 genes), are predicted to be
deleterious by both SIFT and LS-SNP. SIFT and Polyphen
predictions, however, only agree for 2% (495 nsSNPs in
391 genes) of dbSNP. Considering all three methods, the

number of nsSNPs that are predicted to be deleterious
drops to 0.6% (124 in 114 genes) of dbSNP. This figure
represents about 3% of the total number of the nsSNPs
that have Polyphen predictions, largely in line with the
5% true positive estimate given by Ng and Henikoff. If
Polyphen predictions were available for the whole dataset, we should, therefore, expect around 1,000 nsSNPs to
be predicted as deleterious by all three methods.
Environment substitution scores
Several methods have been developed to estimate the
probability of finding a given amino acid substitution in
a given structural environment [36,37,46,47]. Commonly
used definitions of the structural environments include
the accessibility of the side-chain of the amino acid to solvent; the conformation of the backbone of the amino acid

(helix, strand, coil); and whether the amino acid form
hydrogen bonds to other amino acids or ligands. Tables of
the log-odds probability of finding a given amino acid
substitution, in a given structural environment, have previously been calculated for a variety of structural environments [36,37]. These tables describe the likelihood of a
sequence mutation being acceptable within a given environment, and thus observed in homologous sequences.
Given a model of the protein structure, we can calculate
the environmental score (env_score) for each mutation in
the datasets. A negative score would suggest that the given
mutation is not accommodated without major structural
and environment changes to the protein and can be
defined as deleterious. A score close to zero is neutral to
the mutation whereas a positive score suggests that the
substitution is not only readily accepted within the environment but favoured in evolution.

Since there is not structural information available for all
regions of the genes, there are env_score for only 45% of
nsSNPs in dbSNP (9962 in 3198 genes) and 60%(1355 in
355 genes) of OMIM mutations. Over 16% of the OMIM
mutations have very high negative scores (env_score < -4)
suggesting a major, and, thus, deleterious structural
change is required to accommodate these mutations. In
total, nearly one third of the OMIM mutations (35%) are
negative (env_score < -1) with 50% predicted to be
favourable (env_score > 1). In contrast, only 6.6% of the
mutations in the dbSNP have extremely negative scores;
18% negative and 69% positive scores. Env_score and
Polyphen both predict substitutions to be deleterious for
1.7% (372 in 308 genes) of the dbSNP dataset. LS-SNP
and env_score show a slightly higher agreement of 3.6%
(781 in 592 genes). All three methods agree for only 106
nsSNPs.

The most common of these unfavourable substitutions
are mutations from a cysteine, usually buried, to a large
hydrophobic residue (often tryptophan or phenylalanine). Also common is a proline to leucine substitution
as well as mutations from a glycine residue. For example,
the nsSNP, Thr455Ile (rs870849; MAFceu = 0.408%), in
the lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG3) gene is predicted to be deleterious by env_score, LS-SNP and
Polyphen. This gene is involved in lymphocyte activation
and is known to bind to HLA class II antigens, and the
nsSNP has been reported to be associated with susceptibility to multiple sclerosis [48].
Prediction of structural stability
In this study, we have used two methods (SDM[16] and
Imutant[18]) that quantitatively estimate the effect of a
mutation on the stability of a protein structure. Both
methods require a model of the structure of the protein
and are thus rarely used in such genome wide studies of
nsSNPs. SDM predicts nearly twice as many (11%) of the
disease causing mutations in OMIM to have ââG scores
less than -3 than those mutations in dbSNP (6%). The
mutation with the lowest predicted SDM energy score (12.4) is the R149C sequence substitution in the OMIM
found in the Xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) gene. This is
also predicted to be deleterious by SIFT, env_score (-9)
and slightly damaging by Imutant(-1.05). This mutation
is linked to the condition of type I Xanthinuria, which is
caused by XDH deficiency. Another mutation in this gene
(P1150R) is also predicted to be structurally deleterious
by env_score(-3) and SDM (-5.9).

An equally damaging and identical amino acid substitution (R573C), also found in OMIM, occurs in the adenosine monophosphate deaminase 3 (AMPD3) gene. This is
known to cause erythrocyte AMP deaminase deficiency
resulting in a deficiency of a muscle isoform of the gene
and is associated exercise-induced myopathy. From the
dbSNP set, another arginine to cysteine substitution
(R651C; rs4148876; MAFCEU = 0.10) which is predicted
by SDM to have a large negative change in energy (-6.1),
is in the antigen peptide transporter 2 (TAP2) gene. TAP2
is involved in antigen processing and the transport of antigens from the cytoplasm to a membrane-bound compartment for association with MHC class I molecules.
Interestingly, a second nsSNP in this gene (T665A;
rs241447; MAFCEU = 0.217) is also predicted to be deleterious by some of the other methods used.
Similarly to SDM, Imutant seems to be able to distinguish
the known disease causing mutations with 12% of OMIM
predicted to have a large negative (<-2) ââG compared to
7% for dbSNP. One such nsSNP (Arg191Cys; rs3093370;
MAFceu = 0) from the dbSNP set, is predicted to be deleterious by both SDM and Imutant as well as by SIFT,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/301

Env_score and LS-SNP occurs in the interleukin 21 receptor (IL21R). IL-21R is a novel, T-cell specific type I
cytokine receptor most related to the IL-2 receptor beta
chain. Figure 2 shows the model of IL-21R in complex
with IL-21. The residue, Arg191 is buried and is not
involved in binding of the cytokine but forms chargecharge interactions.
A polymorphism (Pro227Thr;MAFCEU = 0.12) in the TCF7
gene has previously been described to be associated with
type 1 diabetes [49] and is predicted to be structurally
destabilising. Another mutation (Trp336Cys; rs1135728;
MAFCEU = unknown) in the HMG_box region of this gene
is predicted to be deleterious by many methods (SIFT,
env_score, SDM and Polyphen). Figure 3 shows a model
of the HMG box region of TCF7 in complex with DNA.
The tryptophan residue sits in the major groove of the
DNA and is critical for interacting with the DNA.
Prediction of functional residues
Functional residues can be defined as those amino acids
that are directly involved in enzyme catalysis or proteinprotein or protein-ligand interactions. Sometimes these
interactions are well documented or can be inferred from
structures of complexes of homologous structures.
Indeed, these are annotated in the predictions available
from LS-SNP. However, this information is often sparse
and it is not straightforward to extrapolate to distantly
related homologues. The models produced in this study
are built as uncomplexed, monomeric structures. Some of
the amino acids will be involved in interfaces if the protein exists as a dimer or higher order oligomers or they
could be involved in binding to a ligand or other molecules. The analysis of sequence variations of amino acids
involved in protein interfaces, inferred from complexes of
close homologues, will be considered in a separate study
(Bickerton, unpublished data). Here, we used Crescendo
to try to predict, from sequence conservation scores, residues which may be involved in function or binding other
molecules.

Crescendo was applied using the sequence alignments
produced by FUGUE and the residue scores mapped onto
the model of the protein. We considered only the subset
of mutations that had neutral or favourable environmental substitution scores (env_score > -2) since these are less
likely to result in major structural rearrangements. In general, the distribution of the mutations in the OMIM is
skewed towards positive Z-scores, an indicator of functional residues, compared with the dbSNP set of mutations (data not shown). Indeed 24% of the OMIM
mutations have a Z-score greater than 1.0 compared to
16% for dbSNP. Of those in the dbSNP, 1.4% (311 nsSNPs in 272 genes) were also predicted to be deleterious by
LS-SNP.

One of the OMIM mutations (Asp299Gly; rs4986790;
MAFCEU = 0.033), which is predicted by Crescendo to be
functional, occurs in the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) gene.
TLR4 activates inflammatory gene expression through NFkappa-B and MAPK signalling and is important in innate
immune responses. This mutation is known to cause
endotoxin hypo-responsiveness by affecting TLR4-mediated LPS signaling [50]. Another nsSNP (rs4740; MAFCEU
= 0.30) from the dbSNP set is found in the Epstein-Barr
virus induced gene 3 (EBI3), a protein homologous to the
p40 subunit of interleukin 12 (IL-12). This is a cytokine
that drives rapid clonal expansion of naive but not memory CD4 T-cells and is involved in the stimulation and
maintenance of Th1 cellular immune responses, includ-

ing the normal host defense against various intracellular
pathogens. IL-12 also has an important role in pathological Th1 responses, such as in inflammatory bowel disease
and multiple sclerosis [10,51].
Consensus predictions
Figures 4 and 5 shows a summary of the overlap for all of
the predictions using the various methods. Almost the
same percentage of OMIM mutations (9%) with structurally neutral or favourable substitutions are predicted to
involve functional residues compared to those in dbSNP
(13%). However, the requirement of structural information for a crescendo function prediction (resulting in predictions for only half of the mutations), means that the

BMC Bioinformatics 2007, 8:301

coverage in OMIM is small. Generally, information detailing residues involved in protein-protein interactions and
ligand binding is still largely lacking. What knowledge
there is available can be derived from existing experimental structures or protein-protein interaction databases.
Some of this information is contained in the LS-SNP and
Polyphen predictions, although collating this information is not straightforward and extrapolating to distant
homologues is not always valid. This makes it is extremely
difficult to produce consensus function predictions that
include multiple methods. Indeed, only an additional 1%
of dbSNP nsSNPs contain deleterious LS-SNP or
Polyphen predictions.
Significantly more OMIM mutations are predicted to be
structurally destabilising by at least two methods compared to those in dbSNP. There are 83 (3.7%) mutations
in OMIM predicted to be structurally destabilising by at
least three of the methods, reducing to only one mutation
predicted by four of the methods. This rare mutation
(Leu21Pro) occurs in the gene GTF2H5, a transcription
factor involved in DNA repair, and causes trichothiodystrophy resulting in patients with brittle hair and nails, due
to a reduced content of cysteine-rich matrix proteins. Considering both functional and structural predictions, an
additional OMIM mutation is predicted by four of the
methods. The Lys426Arg substitution in the gene ATIC
causes AICA-ribosiduria resulting in disruption of purine
biosynthesis by affecting the binding of a potassium ion.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/301

recent analysis found that there was an inverse association
between the MAF of a nsSNP and deleterious functional
prediction[52]. In other words, alleles that are functionally deleterious will tend to be selected against and will
not exist at high frequencies. Here, we asked the question
whether the nsSNPs with rare MAFs are more or less frequently predicted to be deleterious than those variations
with higher allelic frequencies. If we consider the mutations with a deleterious prediction by any method (2,009
nsSNPs), over 76% had a MAF > 0.05 whilst only 9% had
MAF < 0.01. These figures are virtually identical to the proportions of these classes of MAFs occurring in our dataset
(76% and 8%, respectively). When we consider the 49
nsSNPs that are predicted by four or more methods, the
proportion of rare alleles that are predicted to be deleterious increases to 12% whilst the common nsSNPs
decreases slightly to 72%. Due to the small number of
mutations involved, it is unclear whether this is a statistically significant affect.

Discussion

Classification by allele frequency
Each of the nsSNPs in dbSNP was correlated with the
HapMap database to identify its allele frequency in the
European cohort (CEU). This enables each nsSNP to be
classified into one of three classes of allele frequency.
Only 23% (5,770) of the nsSNPs were found in the current release of the HapMap2 database. Almost 8% (425)
of these had MAFs below 0.01 and are thus considered to
be rare mutations. These variations are assumed to only
occur in a single individuals or specific population or in
extremely rare monogenic diseases. Over 17% (960) had
MAFs in the 0.01â0.05 range whereas the majority (4,385
or 76%) had MAFs > 0.05 and can be classified as common sequence variations. Over 1% of the dbSNP mutations (299) are predicted to be deleterious by four or more
methods, 49 of which have been validated in HapMap [2].
Of these, 35 have a MAFCEU > 0.05 and are shown in table
3.

For nearly 90% of the genes analysed here, we have been
able to build a homology-based model of a large part of
the gene which can be useful in understanding the biological effect of a mutation and its effect on function. These
are based on automatically generated structure predictions. It is well documented that the accuracy of structure
prediction can be improved by a careful analysis of each
model[53]. This is often time consuming and so can only
be applied to a small subset of these genes. Some of these
genes are now being selected for further detailed modelling and structural analysis. We have also generated structure-based predictions for the effects of over 40% of the
24,000 nsSNPs observed in these genes. In addition, we
have sequence-based predictions for the remaining 60%
of them. We have shown that most of the prediction tools
used are, in general, able identify a larger proportion of
the mutations which are known to cause disease, as represented by the OMIM mutations, than compared to the
largely neutral mutations in the dbSNP dataset. Using
these predictions we have identified several hundred of
the nsSNPs which could be involved in common disease.
It is important to highlight these variants because if they
are not included in the large-scale genotyping platforms,
nor covered via LD with nearby SNPs that are on the genotyping platform, then it would be justified to develop
special genotyping panels or individuals assays for analysis
in
case-control
sample
sets.

A current debate in molecular genetics is how important
is the contribution of rare sequence variations to an
increased risk in common diseases. Many researchers consider that common variants will make the most important
contribution to the inheritance of multi-factorial disorders, the Common-Disease/Common-Variant theory. A

Currently, over 700 genes (12%) have no confident structure prediction. This lack of structural information is also
a problem for regions of genes that are predicted to be disordered or have low complexity. Even where there is structural information, details of functional residues are sparse
and sometimes inconsistent. There are many projects

Page 12 of 15

BMC Bioinformatics 2007, 8:301

underway to improve data extraction from the plethora of
biological databases or biomedical literature [54,55].
Such information will be invaluable to guide future modelling of multi-protein complexes and to improve the
interpretation of mutation data. The prediction of multiprotein complexes given the structure of individual gene
products will also allow us to analyse the effects of common nsSNP variants between interacting genes or multiple nsSNPs within the same gene.
We have also found evidence that rare alleles are predicted
to be deleterious as often as commonly occurring alleles.
These conclusions may be confounded by the fact that
most of the prediction methods use the OMIM database
of rare alleles as a parameterization set which may bias
predictions to certain types of amino acid substitutions.
The validity of many of the dimorphisms found in dbSNP
is still unclear. Since only 25% of these nsSNPs have been
subsequently found in sequencing projects such as HapMap, there is a potential that the majority of data in
dbSNP contains erroneous, rare or population specific
substitutions. Accurate estimates of the validity of the nsSNPs are needed for all available polymorphisms.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/301

are GPCRs compiled using Ensembl version 27, human
genome assembly build 35 by the Juvenile Diabetes
Research Foundation/Wellcome Trust Diabetes and
Inflammation Laboratory at the Cambridge Institute for
Medical Research. Subsequently, the OMIM genes were
added to the list. In total there are 23720 unique sequence
variations found in over 5500 genes.
Homology recognition of protein sequences
Homology recognition for all of the genes was performed
using the program FUGUE[38]. FUGUE is a program for
recognizing distant homologues by sequence-structure
comparison. Given a sequence or a sequence alignment, it
scans a database of structural profiles derived from the
HOMSTRAD database and calculates a compatibility
score and produces a list of potential homologues and
alignments. FUGUE uses environment-specific substitution tables and structure-dependent gap penalties. For
every gene sequence, homologous sequences were collected using PSI-BLAST. The multiple sequence alignment
was used as input to FUGUE. Only potential homologues
with a score greater than 7 were considered. For potential
hits with overlapping sequence alignments, the lowest
scoring were removed.

Conclusion
It is expected that a proportion of the nsSNPs in dbSNP
that are predicted to be deleterious will increase the relative risk of a developing a disease or traits but may not be
sufficient to cause disease. Many other multi-genic or
environmental factors will also be required before disease
is evident. In the next few years, genetic studies will provide large amounts of data linking nsSNPs and other functional SNPs, and deletion-insertion polymorphisms,
affecting gene expression and splicing, to the risk of developing many diseases. Detailed analysis of the effect
sequence variations of the structure of the protein and its
interactions will be essential for understanding the role
sequence variations have in multi-factorial diseases such
as cancer, type 1 diabetes and heart disease. The automated analyses and model building described here can
easily be applied to new sequence variations as they
become associated with susceptibility to common disorders.

Methods
Datasets of non-synonymous SNPs
There are two sets of mutation data available for analysis
and comparison. The first set, referred to as OMIM, consists of 2,256 sequence variations found in 500 genes previously identified for Mendelian inherited disorders
according to the OMIM database [14]. The second set,
dbSNP, consists of 21,471 sequence variations extracted
from the dbSNP database found in nearly 5,000 genes.
This list of genes was derived from a list of human candidate genes related to immunity, apoptosis, or genes which

Structure prediction using comparative modelling
Once an evolutionary relationship has been established to
a HOMSTRAD family, and hence to a protein of known
3D structure, a model of the structure of the protein can
be built using comparative modelling techniques[52,56].
The sequence-structure alignment given by FUGUE was
used to build a model with the program Modeller[42].
Due to the large number of alignments, no re-alignment
of the FUGUE alignment was attempted.
Environmental substitution scores
Residue environments are defined, as described by
Topham [57], in terms of mainchain conformation, relative sidechain solvent accessibility and sidechain hydrogen bonding. Four mainchain conformations (Î±-helix, bstrand, +ve phi and coil) are defined along with two types
of solvent accessibility (<40%; over 40%). There are also
three types of independent hydrogen bonding possible
(sidechain to sidechain; sidechain to mainchain amide;
sidechain to mainchain carboxyl). This gives a total of 64
(4 Ã 2 Ã 2 Ã 2 Ã 2) residue environments. These tables
describe the probabilities of substituting a residue in each
structural environment by each of the 21 residue types,
distinguishing cystine and cysteine.
Prediction of functional residues by crescendo
Crescendo [30] identifies amino acids substitutions which
are likely to be involved in protein function or protein
interactions. It compares the observed sequence conservation for each amino acid position in the homologous

Page 13 of 15

BMC Bioinformatics 2007, 8:301

sequences of a protein with the conservation pattern predicted on the basis of local environment substitution
tables. For those positions where the environment substitution tables make poor predictions of the overall amino
acid substitution pattern, it can be assumed that these
regions must be restrained by functional requirements of
the protein. The Crescendo score quantifies the degree of
observed sequence conservation at an amino acid position compared to the conservation expected based upon
the environment-dependent substitution tables.
Prediction of free energy change by SDM
Protein stability is dependent on the difference in free
energy (âGU-F) between the folded (F) and unfolded (U)
states (âGU-F = GU - Gf). The mutation of a residue of type
j in the wild-type protein to residue of type k may be coupled to the reversible folding-unfolding process by means
of the thermodynamic cycle. The difference in free energy
of unfolding, ââG, of the wild type and mutant, is therefore related to the respective free energy changes associated with the transformation of j-> k in the unfolded and
folded states through the thermodynamic cycle. SDM calculates stability score differences (âs), derived from environmental substitution tables[36,37], for mutations in
the folded and unfolded structural environments. Analogous to the thermodynamic cycle, these scores can be then
be used to represent the component processes of the folding-unfolding cycle to predict a ââs for a mutation[16].
