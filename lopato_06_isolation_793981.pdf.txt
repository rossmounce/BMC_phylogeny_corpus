Abstract
Background: The preparation of expressional cDNA libraries for use in the yeast two-hybrid
system is quick and efficient when using the dedicated Clontech™ product, the MATCHMAKER
Library Construction and Screening Kit 3. This kit employs SMART technology for the amplification
of full-length cDNAs, in combination with cloning using homologous recombination.
Unfortunately, such cDNA libraries prepared directly in yeast can not be used for the efficient
recovery of purified plasmids and thus are incompatible with existing yeast one-hybrid systems,
which use yeast transformation for the library screen.
Results: Here we propose an adaptation of the yeast one-hybrid system for identification and
cloning of transcription factors using a MATCHMAKER cDNA library. The procedure is
demonstrated using a cDNA library prepared from the liquid part of the multinucleate coenocyte
of wheat endosperm. The method is a modification of a standard one-hybrid screening protocol,
utilising a mating step to introduce the library construct and reporter construct into the same cell.
Several novel full length transcription factors from the homeodomain, AP2 domain and E2F families
of transcription factors were identified and isolated.
Conclusion: In this paper we propose a method to extend the compatibility of MATCHMAKER
cDNA libraries from yeast two-hybrid screens to one-hybrid screens. The utility of the new yeast
one-hybrid technology is demonstrated by the successful cloning from wheat of full-length cDNAs
encoding several transcription factors from three different families.

Background
Development of plant organs is determined by differential
gene expression which can be regulated at many different
levels. The major mechanism of differential gene expression is transcriptional regulation [1] which is controlled
by transcription factors that bind to DNA cis-elements

located in gene promoters and/or introns. Analysis of
sequenced genomes revealed that transcription factors
compose up to 10% of metazoan genomes [2] and more
than 5% of the genes in Arabidopsis were identified as transcription factors [3]. The use of microarray data and clustering algorithms enables identification of genes with

similar expression profiles that may be involved in similar
biological processes [4]. Analysis of the promoters of such
genes can identify common cis-elements, responsible for
their co-expression [5]. Nevertheless, these data fail to
reveal the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms because
of the complexity of the promoter sequences, the relatively small number of cis-regulatory elements and transcription factors that have been characterised, and lack of
data about cooperative regulation of gene expression in
plants by several transcription factors simultaneously. To
understand transcriptional mechanisms that lead to differential gene expression, genes have to be experimentally
coordinated with the corresponding TFs that regulate their
expression.
A powerful method of identifying protein-DNA interactions is the yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) system which is a variant of the yeast two-hybrid system (Y2H) [6-8] Like the
Y2H, the Y1H is based on the domain structure of eukaryotic transcription factors, consisting of a transcription activation domain (AD) and a DNA binding domain (BD). A
part of the promoter or tandem copies of putative transcription regulatory DNA elements are cloned upstream of
a reporter gene in a reporter vector. In the latest version of
the method, part of the reporter vector containing the ciselement of interest upstream of the reporter gene is introduced into the yeast genomic DNA via homologous
recombination with a non-essential gene [9]. This stabilises the results of the Y1H screen and brings the proteinDNA interaction into the natural environment of the
nucleus. The second component of the Y1H system is
shared with the Y2H system. This is a cDNA library which
expresses a fusion protein of a constitutive activation
domain and a variable DNA binding domain encoded by
the appropriate cDNA. The Y1H reporter strain is transformed with a cDNA library vector, and interaction
between target DNA and hybrid protein is detected by
reporter gene expression [10].
The advantage of the Y1H screen compared to biochemical in vitro techniques, such as DNA affinity chromatography, or the identification of DNA binding proteins seen in
electrophoretic mobility shift assays using high-resolution
two-dimensional electrophoresis coupled with MS [11], is
that the procedure does not require specific optimisation
of in vitro conditions. This method allows examination of
protein-DNA interactions in vivo in the conditions inside
the nucleus of the eukaryotic cell. This environment often
provides correct folding and modifications of the prey
protein [12]. The Y1H system also enables the use of
known cis-elements as well as non-characterised fragments of promoters to search for specifically interacting
DNA-binding proteins in expressional cDNA libraries
[10,13]. DNA-binding proteins that do not function in
transcription and lack a native AD (such as chromatin

http://www.plantmethods.com/content/2/1/3

remodelling, replication and DNA repair proteins, and
enzymes involved in transposable elements movement)
can also be found using this approach, as a strong, heterologous AD is added to the prey protein [14,15]. This
method enables the cloning of families of factors with
conserved DNA binding domains which can interact with
the same cis-activation DNA element [16-19]. The screening of several millions of colonies simultaneously makes
the Y1H system extremely sensitive, allowing the cloning
of very low abundance transcription factors which may be
absent from even very large EST databases.
To clone a group of specific factors one can make the
library from a particular tissue, part of a tissue or a group
of cells. Methods for the preparation of such libraries,
from limited amounts of starting material, were developed recently [8,20] and kits for their preparation are
available commercially. One such kit, the MATCHMAKER
Library Construction Kit 3 (Clontech™, Palo Alta, CA),
provides a simple method for the construction of cDNA
expression libraries for Y2H screening. The library construction protocol integrates the efficiency of SMART
cDNA synthesis technology [8,20,21] with the simplicity
of cloning using homologous recombination in yeast
[22].
Although the MATCHMAKER Library Construction Kit
provides a facile method for Y2H screening, the application of pre-made MATCHMAKER cDNA libraries to the
Y1H method has not been proposed. Here we describe an
adaptation of a straightforward and efficient version of
the Y1H method [9], enabling the screening of MATCHMAKER cDNA libraries for protein/DNA interactions. The
cDNA library used in the Y1H screen was prepared from a
small amount of total RNA isolated from the liquid part
of wheat endosperm before and during cellularisation. We
demonstrate the efficiency of the method by cloning several wheat transcription factors using three different tandem repeats of a known DNA cis-element as bait.

Results
Adaptation of the Y1H system to screen expressional
cDNA libraries prepared in yeast
To facilitate the cloning and characterisation of transcription factors from wheat, a plant with a very large and unsequenced genome, we combined one of the existing Y1H
systems with a quick and relatively simple method of preparing cDNA expression libraries

The cDNA library was prepared from 2 µg of total RNA
isolated from the liquid part of the wheat endosperm
coenocyte collected before and during cellularisation, at 3
to 7 days after pollination (DAP), and was originally
designed for the two-hybrid screen based upon yeast mating. It was prepared using the Yeast MATCHMAKER Sys-

tem 3, which enabled the quick and relatively easy
construction of representative libraries from a small
amount of tissue by homologous recombination-mediated cloning in yeast.
As the first libraries prepared according to the Clontech™
manual contained too many inserts smaller than 600 bp,
we introduced a small change into the method and used
CHROMA SPIN+TE-1000 (Clontech™) instead of
CHROMA SPIN+TE-400 columns for cDNA size fractionation. According to the CHROMA SPIN Columns User
Manual (PT1300-1), a single purification on the TE-1000
column removes about 60% of cDNA smaller than 1 kb.
This change in the protocol substantially increased the the
average length of cDNAs and thus the frequency of fulllength cDNAs in the library in comparison with the original method, while still preserving good representation of
short cDNAs. Results of the PCR analysis of the length of
cDNA inserts from 24 randomly selected library clones are
shown in Fig. 1. The library was prepared without amplification and stored as aliquots of the yeast glycerol culture.
It has been used for Y2H and Y1H screens for more than
4 years after preparation without any noticeable changes
in quality.
Y1H reporter strains were prepared by cloning three to
four tandem repeats of: 1) the cis-elements specific for two
classes of homeodomain transcription factors (HDZipIII) [23,24]; 2) the Drought Responsive Element (DRE)
from the promoter of the rd29A gene from Arabidopsis thaliana, specific for the DREB/CBF subfamily of single AP2domain proteins [25]; and 3) the E2F binding cis-element
from the promoter of the ribonucleotide reductase (RNR)
gene of tobacco [26].
The use of repeats of cis-elements helps to optimise the
distance between the plant regulatory element and the
minimal promoter of the yeast GAL4 gene.
Oligonucleotides with complementary sequences for each
tandem of cis-elements (Table 1) were designed so that
after annealing they had protruding ends which were used
for cloning into NotI-SpeI sites of the pINT1-HIS3NB
binary vector (unpublished, kindly provided by Dr. PBF
Ouwerkerk). The pINT1-HIS3NB vector was obtained by
cloning the NotI-BamHI fragment of the pHIS3NB cloning
vector into the NotI-BclI sites of the pINT1 integration vector [9,12]. This enabled single step cloning of cis-elements
into the unique NotI and SpeI restriction sites of the binary
vector. Constructs containing inserts were selected by PCR
using primers from the vector. Empty vector served as a
template for the control of fragment size.
In order to simplify electrophoretic analysis of the small
sized inserts, PCR primers were designed to anneal

approximately 50 bp either side of the cloning sites, giving
an amplicon from empty vector of about 100 bp. Plasmids with inserts were subsequently analysed by sequencing using the same primers. Integration of the construct
into the yeast genomic DNA was performed as described
in [12]. Reporter strains, designated yHDZipI-II, yDRE,
and yE2F, respectively, were incubated overnight in rich
media, and stored as 1 ml aliquots of glycerol culture at 80°C until use. Before screening, a yeast glycerol culture
was thawed at room temperature and incubated for several hours in 50 ml YPDA media at 30°C, with shaking, to
revive yeast cells. This increased the efficiency of mating
the reporter strain with the strain containing the expressional library.
cDNA expression libraries for the Y1H screen were usually
made in E. coli using binary vectors which are able to replicate in both bacteria and yeast. To make a screen, pools
of library plasmid DNA purified from bacteria were transformed into the yeast reporter strain. Unfortunately,
cDNA libraries prepared directly in yeast cannot be used
for the isolation of large amounts of the library plasmid
DNA, and thus the Y1H screen can not be performed
using plasmid transformation. To perform the Y1H
screen, we mated each bait yeast reporter strain, based on
Y187 (MATa), with the Yeast MATCHMAKER System 3
cDNA library prepared in the yeast strain AH109 (MATα).
This approach provided us with the capacity to use, in
yeast one-hybrid screens, cDNA libraries prepared according to the method proposed by Clontech™. In addition,
mating with the AH109 strain enabled us to omit the
labourious β-galactosidase filter assay. Rather, we used
MEL1 [27], one of the reporter genes of this strain,
together with direct addition of the α-galactosidase substrate X-α-GAL into selective media, to stain false positives
(blue colonies) on plates during the second round of
selection for positive clones. The promoter of MEL1 con-

tains no plant cis-elements and does not interact specifically with transcription factors, but does interact with a
large group of false positives, which interact with the
MEL1 minimal promoter (Fig. 2).
An additional advantage of this method is that the same
cDNA library, prepared from endosperm, was subsequently used for the further characterisation of the isolated transcription factor genes. After re-cloning selected
transcription factor cDNAs into the pGBKT7 vector (Clontech™), they were used as bait for the identification of
their interacting partners via the Y2H screen (data not
shown). The strategy of the Y1H screen as well as selection
and analysis of positive clones is shown in Fig. 3.
Results of the Y1H screens
To test the method, we chose specific cis-regulatory elements for families of transcription factors which are of
interest in our laboratory. These are factors known to be
involved in the regulation of cell fate (HDZip TF), cell
proliferation and cell size (E2F), and factors which can
potentially be involved in the protection of the developing grain from drought or cold stress (DREB/CBF TF).
Some of these cis-elements were successfully used as a bait
in Y1H screens to clone HDZip and DREB factors from
other plant species [13,19,28,29]. For others, such as
E2Fs, specific interaction between cis-elements and transcription factors has only been demonstrated in vitro,
using gel shift assays [26,30,31]. The list of cis-elements
used in this paper is shown in Table 1.

More than 100 positive clones were isolated in the screen
with the yHD-ZipI-II bait strain. The clones encoded full
and partial length cDNAs of three different proteins. Two
were designated TaHDZipI-1 and TaHDZipI-2 and represented 20% and 76% of all clones, respectively. Sequence
analyses of the longest clones showed the cDNAs to be 1.0
and 1.1 kb, encoding proteins of 267 and 333 amino
acids, respectively. Comparative sequence alignments
with seven HDZip (Oshox) proteins from rice [13,32]
were used to confirm that the full-length open reading

25
26

frames of each gene had been cloned. These alignments
revealed TaHDZipI-1 and TaHDZipI-2 to be most similar
to rice Oshox4 and Oshox6, respectively, and identified
TaHDZipI-1 and TaHDZipI-2 as homeodomain-leucine
zipper subfamily I proteins (Fig. 4A).
The remaining clones were represented by four independent clones (4%) containing 1.2 kb inserts encoding the
full length coding region (279 amino acids) of a class II
HDZip factor. This was designated TaHDZipII-1. It has the
highest level of protein sequence identity with Oshox2
from rice.
About 25 colonies were isolated in the Y1H screen using
repeated DRE as bait. cDNAs (with full length coding
regions) of three transcription factors were isolated from
white colonies after a second round of selection. Two
novel DREB factors, designated TaDREB2 and TaDREB3
were cloned from the cDNA library prepared from the liquid part of the syncytial endosperm of wheat. The first was
either an orthologue or close homologue (38.8 % identity
in amino acid sequences) of TINY from Arabidopsis. This is
a single AP2 domain factor involved in plant development [33]. TaDREB3 is a novel single AP2 domain transcription factor with 77.7% amino acid sequence identity
to the HvCBF5 [34]. The relationship between these
sequences is shown in Fig. 4B. Interestingly, the third transcription factor isolated in this screen was a putative Myb
transcription factor, designated TaMyb1. The 1182 bp
insert encodes a 298 amino acid protein which belongs to
the R2R3 group of Myb factors. Two independent clones
encoding the same TaMYB were found in the screen. As
MYB factors have not previously been associated with the
DRE element, we decided to conduct more tests to confirm that this protein indeed interacts with the drought
responsive element. To demonstrate this, Y187, AH109
and each of the three yeast strains described in this paper,
with different plant cis-elements, were transformed using
the plasmid containing TaMYB cDNA; we found that the
expression of TaMYB supports growth on selective media
of the yDRE strain only, and does not support the growth

and encodes a 423 amino acid protein, designated
TaE2Fe. Alignment of the amino acid sequence of TaE2Fe
to E2Fe factor from Arabidopsis is shown in Fig. 4C.

Several hundred colonies were selected in the Y1H screen
with the E2F cis-element as bait (yE2F strain). Ninety-six
colonies were used for the second round of selection and
94 were white on media with X-GAL. The cDNA inserts of
white colonies were analysed by PCR and restriction using
HaeIII to show that all 94 colonies contained plasmids
with the same insert. The insert encoded an E2F transcription factor with the highest level of amino acid identity to
E2Fe (DEL1) from Arabidopsis. This is an important inhibitor of the endocycle, which preserves the mitotic state of
proliferating cells by suppressing transcription of genes
that are required for cells to enter the DNA endoreduplication cycle [35,36]. All clones contained the full length
coding region; the length of the isolated cDNA is 1508 bp

Q-PCR analysis of expression levels of identified proteins
The spatial and temporal expression patterns of isolated
wheat homeobox-containing proteins and DREB proteins
were determined by real-time or quantitative PCR (QPCR). cDNAs used for these analyses were derived from a
variety of vegetative and floral tissues, grain at different
stages of development (1–20 DAP), and fractions of the
grain at 5 DAP enriched either for the embryo, the liquid
part of the syncytial endosperm or the outer layers of the
grain (testa, pericarp, etc.).

The data demonstrated a correlation between the abundance of mRNAs of cloned transcription factors in the
plant tissue sample and the number of independent

clones of the respective cDNAs obtained from the cDNA
library prepared from this tissue.
The HDZip family of genes
TaHDZipI-1 and TaHDZipI-2 showed a similar expression
profile in developing flowers, grain, and grain fractions,
except TaHDZipI-1 displayed stronger expression in the
embryo enriched fraction relative to the liquid part of the
endosperm (Fig. 6). However, expression levels of these
proteins in other plant tissues differed considerably. TaHDZipI-2 was strongly expressed in shoots of 10 cm long
seedlings, and was absent in mature tissues. In contrast,
TaHDZipI-1 was expressed in both seedlings and mature
tissues with maximal expression in the stem. The TaHDZipI-1 gene was most highly expressed in the embryo
enriched fraction whilst TaHDZipI-2 was expressed predominantly in seedling shoots and in the first three days
of grain development. The transcript abundance of TaHDZipII-1 was found to be very low (bordering the limits of
detection for the method) in all tissues with the highest
level of expression in seedling shoots.

Abundance of mRNAs of TaHDZipI-1, TaHDZipI-2 and
TaHDZipII-1 in the liquid fraction of endosperm isolated
at the 5 DAP is about 18000, 8000 and 100 copies per µg
of total RNA, respectively. This correlates well with the
abundance of their clones isolated in the Y1H screen from
the cDNA library.
The DREB family of genes
mRNAs of both TaDREB2 and TaDREB3 have a very low
level of abundance in all examined tissues of unstressed
wheat (several copies per µg of total RNA according to the
Q-PCR data) and are therefore expected to be represented
by a relatively low number of plasmids in the cDNA
library. This correlates with our results (Fig. 6). The results
of Q-PCR for TaDREB3 are not shown in the figure as the
data were well below the limit of detection for the
method. Nevertheless, the cDNA of TaDREB3 was cloned
because the screening of a high number of clones (about
six million) facilitates the isolation of even very low abundance cDNAs.

The expression pattern of TaE2Fe has not been studied yet.

Discussion
Method improvement
Since the development of the reverse transcription and
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and genomic and
EST databases for several plants, isolation of target genes
has become a routine procedure. Unfortunately, one of
the problems is that the application of RT-PCR is limited
to plants for which extensive EST databases exist and

is not always the case with rare transcripts such as those
for many transcription factors. Another problem which
arises in work with plants containing large or polyploid
genomes, such as bread wheat, is isolation of full length
sequences of long cDNAs. Application of both RACE-PCR
and Genome Walking is labour intensive and is often not
very efficient. Alternative methods of cDNA cloning are
based on the utilisation of properties of DNA and proteins
that specifically recognise and bind other molecules
through the screening of cDNA expression libraries.
Among these methods is the yeast one-hybrid system
which inter alia can be used for the isolation of novel
genes, which encode proteins that bind to a DNA target
sequence such as cis-regulatory elements.
The Y1H assay is highly sensitive because detection of the
interactions between the protein and DNA target occur
while proteins are in their native configurations in vivo.
The most evolutionally conserved cis-elements characterised across several plant species (for example, Arabidopsis,
rice or maize) can be used for isolation of orthologues and
homologues from phylogenetically distant plants as well
as plants with complex or multiple genomes, especially
when PCR methods are not efficient because of the
absence of in silico data.
In this paper, we successfully used DRE from Arabidopsis
and E2F cis-element from tobacco to isolate wheat transcription factors. Since this method allows the screening
of several millions of colonies simultaneously, the Y1H
system allows the cloning of full length cDNAs of DNA
binding proteins which have very low levels of expression.
Based on these advantages, the Y1H method was chosen
to clone full length transcription factors from the developing endosperm of wheat.
To get the maximum benefit from this method, the original Y1H protocol was modified. The first improvement
was introduced in the method of screening. The Y1H is
typically labour intensive as it relies on the isolation of the
library plasmids from the bacterial library host strain followed by transformation of the isolated library plasmids
into the reporter yeast strain to allow the protein-DNA
interaction. Although lambda-based E. coli-yeast shuttle
vector libraries do have their advantages, for example the
possibility to introduce the library into different yeast
strains, there are several disadvantages: 1) the methods of
library preparation in bacteria are usually more labourious than directly in yeast; 2) the need to amplify libraries
for the isolation of large amounts of plasmids, which
reduces the quality of the libraries; and 3) the labourious
and not always efficient large scale yeast transformation
must be repeated for each screen.

Example of confirmation of protein -DNA interaction for MYB and DREB proteins by the Y1H assay.

The modification of the protocol for Y1H screening presented here involves utilising a yeast mating step to introduce the library plasmid and reporter construct into the
same cell. This modification improves the efficiency of the
screen, prevents unnecessary amplification of the cDNA
library and eliminates the labour intensive steps of phage
infections, growing E. coli cultures and making plasmid
maxipreparations. A representative cDNA library enriched
for full length cDNAs can be prepared from a few µg of
total RNA directly in the yeast strain (MATa) as proposed
in the Clontech™ MATCHMAKER manual. The library is
then screened by mating with a reporter strain (MATα).
Use of the library without amplification leads, as demonstrated in this paper, to a correlation between the abundance of particular mRNAs in the original RNA and in the
library prepared from this sample.
A second modification of the method was introduced in
the cDNA library preparation. Utilisation of cDNA size
fractionation columns other than those suggested in the
Clontech™ protocol substantially enriched the library
with full length sequences. All cDNAs reported here were
represented by both partial and full length clones. Only
one cDNA from 15 cDNAs of transcription factors cloned
in our laboratory from such libraries had a partial open
reading frame. The longest full length cDNA was 3.2 kb
long (data not shown).
The third improvement comes from the utilisation of
AH109 strain, which contains the MEL1 reporter gene
under its own promoter containing a Gal4p binding site.
The MEL1 gene encodes α-galactosidase, which in contrast to β-galactosidase is secreted from the yeast cell and

its activity can be easily detected by direct addition of substrate to selective media instead of the labour intensive filter-lift assay for β-galactosidase. The MEL1 gene was
successfully used as a negative reporter to eliminate the
group of proteins interacting with the minimal promoter
of GAL4, which is situated in the bait construct downstream of the cis-element of interest. However, in some
rare cases, plant transcription factors can weakly activate
the GAL4 promoter and colonies of interest can become
slightly blue after several days of growth on the media
with substrate. We recommend including such colonies in
further characterisation of cloned sequences.
Results of Y1H screen
Repeats of the nine base pair sequences 5'-CAATNATTG3' with either A/T for HDZip class I or G/C for HDZip class
II in the middle position [23,24] were successfully used
earlier in a Y1H screen of a cDNA library prepared from
rice embryos at 6 DAP [13]. Although, we have found that
both class I and class II HDZip transcription factors recognise each of four sequences in the Y1H screen (data not
shown), baits used in this paper contained four repeated
cis-elements, each time with a different nucleotide in the
middle position. Abundance of the clone for each particular isolated HDZip factor in the cDNA library was correlated with the abundance of mRNA in the tissue used for
library preparation. This confirms the good quality of the
library.

Because of the relatively high abundance of TaHDZipI-1
and TaHDZipI-2 in the library and the strong interaction
of HDZip proteins with the specific cis-element, the occurrence of false positives was very low. Unfortunately,

because of the relatively abundant sequences, tens or even
hundreds of clones have to be analysed to find extremely
rare cDNAs. For example, only three TaHDZipII-1 clones
were found in around 100 analysed colonies. Neither use
of other baits with slightly changed sequences nor PCR
analysis of more clones revealed other HDZip factors of
class I and II in wheat syncytial and cellularising
endosperm at 3 to 7 DAP (data not shown).

Surprisingly, using DRE element as bait, we also isolated
several independent clones of the MYB transcription factor designated TaMYB1. Using the Y1H assay and different
reporter strains it was confirmed that TaMYB1 interacts
with either DRE or part of DRE. Several MYB-like proteins
were reported to be isolated from plants using a Y1H
screen [41-43]. However, none of the cis-elements that
were used as bait has a high level of identity to DRE.

Several AP2 domain containing transcription factors from
the DREB/CBF subfamily were isolated from Arabidopsis
[28,29] and maize [19] with the help of theY1H system.
The triple DRE cis-element from Arabidopsis has been successfully used in the Y1H system to confirm the interaction of TaDREB1 with the Drought Responsive Element
from Arabidopsis [37]. Here we demonstrate successful isolation of two DREB proteins from wheat endosperm using
the same Arabidopsis cis-element repeat 5'-TACCGACAT3'. This implies that the DRE element can be used to
obtain cDNAs of DREB proteins from various plant species, as the DRE motif itself is highly conserved in all
plants studied [38].

TaMYB1 belongs to the R2R3 group of MYB factors as it
contains two DNA-binding domains in the N-terminal
region of the protein. The R2R3 group is the largest in
plants with over 100 estimated TFs in Arabidopsis [44].
Members of this group were found to be involved in the
regulation of secondary metabolism, plant morphogenesis, signal transduction in plant growth, abiotic stress and
pathogen defense [45]. Different target recognition sites
were identified for different groups of MYB proteins as
well as within the same group [45]. The sequences of most
MYB binding sites are different from that of DRE. However, MYB proteins are known to have considerable inherent flexibility in their ability to recognise target sites [46].

Although DREB proteins are induced by different environmental stresses, very low levels of their mRNAs can often
be found in unstressed tissues [39]. This can be explained
either by the involvement of some of these transcription
factors in plant development, or the naturally low
amounts of DREBs can be important for the positive regulation of their own expression. It may also be that the
low amount of some DREB factors is important for negative regulation of the expression of other DREB proteins
during stress [40]. It was therefore not surprising that one
of the isolated factors is either an orthologue or close
homologue of TINY from Arabidopsis, a DREB factor
which is involved in developmental processes. An Arabidopsis mutant overexpressing TINY demonstrated
decreased cell size resulting in the "tiny" size of the whole
plant [33]. Another factor isolated in the screen,
TaDREB3, has some level of identity to cold induced CBF
factors, although its function is still unknown. Currently,
both factors are being tested for their induction in
response to environmental stresses.

The DRE is present in many abiotic stress response genes
and it is conceivable that some members of the MYB family of transcription factors regulate the coordinated
response of plants to drought stress through the same element. A MYB factor AtMYB2 has been demonstrated to be
involved in the regulation of the drought and ABA stress
response in Arabidopsis [47]. AtMYB2 is induced by
drought and also during seed maturation and interacts in
vitro with DNA elements containing a consensus MYB recognition sequence 5'-TAACTG-3'. Although it belongs to
the same subfamily of Myb proteins as TaMYB, it is not a
close homologue of TaMYB (23.8% amino acid sequence
identity). It is also possible that TaMYB is not a stress
inducible protein but involved in the regulation of developmental processes in the absence of stress through the
DRE or part of the DRE of several genes. It might be
exchanged for more abundant or more specific DREB factors as soon as the plant is exposed to stress. Although we
have not yet identified the specific DNA sequence which
interacts with TaMYB, we do not believe that it is the core
sequence of the DRE, but probably the sequence generated between the borders of DRE repeats.

The small number of clones obtained in the screen with
DRE correlates with the extremely low amount of mRNAs
encoding DREB2 factor in the unstressed syncytial
endosperm as detected by Q-PCR (Fig. 6). The abundance
of DREB3 in the cDNA is below the sensitivity of the QPCR method in all tissues analysed and is not shown here.
Low abundance of DREB sequences in the cDNA library
led to smaller numbers of positive clones and higher
numbers of blue false positives, the main types of which
will be discussed below.

The cis-element for E2F proteins is highly conserved in all
organisms. It was reported that the canonical cis-element
from human promoters interacts with plant E2F factors in
vitro [48]. E2F factors from Arabidopsis interact in vitro with
the cis-element from a tobacco promoter [30]. The Y1H
system has not been used previously for isolation of E2F
cDNAs. However, it was used to demonstrate interaction
of human E2F-1 with the WDV2 cis-element from the
large intergenic region of the wheat dwarf virus (WDV)

[49]. We could not isolate any E2F factors from wheat
endosperm using the WDV element as bait (data not
shown). A screen with the E2F cis-element from the promoter of the ribonucleotide reductase gene (RNR1b) from
tobacco was more successful. The strong interaction of the
human E2F5 protein with this element was demonstrated
in vitro [26]. The fact that the first 94 quickly growing colonies selected in our screen with a triple repeat of the
tobacco cis-element contained the full length sequence of
the cDNA encoding the same TaE2Fe factor reflects the
very strong interaction of this factor with the bait. Unfortunately, it is not clear yet if other wheat E2F factors are
unable to recognise this sequence or simply are not represented in the cDNA library or in the liquid endosperm
fraction from which the library was prepared.
False positives
Traditionally, Y2H screens are known to give a large
amount of false positives [50,51]. The method of preparation of cDNA libraries and screening strategy for Y2H proposed by Clontech™ has several important improvements
in comparison with other strategies. These eliminate some
groups of false positives and sometimes give unambiguous results, but there is still no complete solution to the
problem. Surprisingly, the Y1H screens of the same
expressional cDNA libraries using known cis-elements
give fewer false positives. In the case of strong proteinDNA interactions or the relatively high abundance of the
cDNAs in the library (for example TaE2Fe and TaHD-ZipI
TFs), most of the largest colonies were white in the αgalactosidase assay and encoded the expected type of transcription factors.

The blue colonies, which start to grow 3 to 4 days after
appearance of quickly growing colonies, contain abundant cDNAs encoding some ribosomal proteins, histones,
abundant housekeeping enzymes, etc. Some of these proteins appear to have the ability for non-specific interaction with a minimal promoter of all reporter genes; others
(usually the latest colonies) are the result of the "leaky"
growth on the -His medium because of non-optimal selection of the 3-AT concentration.

A further type of false positive specific for wheat grain
cDNA libraries is a Zn-finger transcription factor which
appears as the most abundant clone in the first portion of
white colonies when specific protein-DNA interactions
are weak or abundance of the cDNAs of interest is very low
in the cDNA library (such as the screen of the cDNA
library prepared from unstressed material with DRE ciselement).
This factor is a homologue of AtVOZ1 and AtVOZ 2 proteins from Arabidopsis, which specifically interact with a 38
bp region of the promoter of the vacuolar H+-pyrophosphatase (V-PPase) gene [52]. AtVOZ2 binds as a dimer to
the specific palindromic sequence, GCGTNx7ACGC. At
least a few colonies containing the clone of the same
wheat AtVOZ-like protein were found in screens with several different reporter strains (data not shown). This
result, and the finding that the expression of wheat
AtVOZ-like protein does not support growth of the nonmodified Y187 strain on selective media, led us to conclude that part of the vector sequence that introduced into
the yeast genome together with the bait sequence is recognised by this factor. As soon as the size and restriction pattern of the insert which encodes AtVOZ-like protein is
known, clones encoding this protein can be easily eliminated before plasmid purification and sequencing.

Conclusion
In this paper an efficient way to use MATCHMAKER
cDNA libraries for the yeast one-hybrid screen is proposed
and demonstrated by cloning full length cDNAs of seven
wheat transcription factors from several different families.
Good correlation was found between abundance of particular clones in the cDNA library and the abundance of
respective mRNAs in the RNA isolated from the liquid
endosperm. The advantages of the method and possible
false positives are discussed.

Methods
Generation of yeast reporter strains
Y1H reporter constructs were prepared by the cloning of
tandems containing 3 to 4 repeats of the cis-elements for

HDZipI-II, DREB/CBF, and E2F transcription factors into
the pINT1-HIS3NB vector (see Table 1 for the DNA oligonucleotides used for cis-element preparation). The oligonucleotides with partially complementary sequences were
annealed using Annealing Buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH
7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA) and the resulting overhangs were used for cloning into the SpeI-NotI sites of the
pINT1-HIS3NB vector. pINT1-HIS3NB vector (unpublished, kindly provided by Dr. PBF Ouwerkerk) was generated by cloning the NotI -BamHI fragment of the
pHIS3NB vector into the NotI-BclI unique sites of pINT1
[12]. Two unique restriction sites, NotI and SpeI, can be
used for single step directional cloning of DNA fragments
of interest into the binary vector. Constructs with inserts
were selected by PCR using primers derived from the vector primers pINTseq and pINTseqr (Table 1) and
sequenced using the same primers. Before yeast transformation, a fragment lacking the pUC29 sequence was isolated after restriction with NcoI-SacI. Integration of the
construct into the PDC6 locus of yeast genomic DNA via
double crossover was performed as described in [12].
Reporter strains, designated yHDZipI-II, yDRE, and yE2F,
were incubated overnight in the rich YPDA media, mixed
with glycerol to 25% final concentration, and stored as 1
ml aliquots at -80°C until use.
cDNA library construction
Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Chinese Spring)
plants were grown in glasshouses with day temperatures
of 18–25°C and night temperatures of 18–21°C, with a
13 h photoperiod. Spikes were labelled at anthesis.
Pooled samples of liquid endosperm were collected at 3 to
7 DAP by pipette aspiration from the embryo sacs of dissected micropylar tips of the grain. Total RNA was isolated
from wheat samples using TRI REAGENT (Molecular
Research Centre, Inc., Cincinnati, OH), and 2 µg total
RNA was used for the preparation of MATCHMAKER
Two-Hybrid System 3 (Clontech, Palo Alta, CA) cDNA
libraries according to the supplied manual, with the following modification: CHROMA SPIN+TE-1000 columns
were used for the cDNA size fractionation, instead of the
suggested CHROMA SPIN+TE-400 columns. The cDNA
library was washed out from 100 plates with 300 ml
YPDA containing 25% glycerol and 25 µg/ml kanamycin,
and incubated for 30 min at 30°C with rotation (220
rpm). 1.5 ml aliquots of the cDNA library were frozen on
dry ice and stored at -80°C until use.
cDNA library screen
The conditions used for the one-hybrid screen are
described in [12], with the following modification:
instead of transformation of the reporter strain with plasmids prepared from an amplified cDNA library, we used
overnight yeast mating with the AH109 strain, containing
the library, prepared according to the protocol for the

http://www.plantmethods.com/content/2/1/3

MATCHMAKER Two-Hybrid System Kit (Clontech™). 50
ml of overnight culture (alternatively, 1 ml of glycerol culture, thawed in a water bath at room temperature and
diluted to 50 ml with YPDA) of each reporter strain were
centrifuged for 5 min at 2000 rpm (Rotanta 460R table
centrifuge, Hettich). The pellet was resuspended in 50 ml
of 2 × YPDA medium containing 25 µg/ml kanamycin,
mixed with a 1.5 ml aliquot of pre-made cDNA library in
the AH109 yeast strain and incubated in a 2 l conical flask
at 30°C overnight with slow (30–50 rpm) rotation. After
17–24 h of mating, the yeast cells were harvested, washed
with 1 × TE buffer, pH 8.0, containing 25 µg/ml kanamycin, resuspended in 5 ml of the same buffer and spread on
plates with selective media (-Leu, -His) containing 5–10
mM 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT) to reduce possible
leaky expression of HIS3 gene. The optimal concentration
of 3-AT was determined before the screen as described in
[12]. Library plasmids were isolated from positive colonies and analysed as described [9,12], except that the use
of the α-galactosidase reporter gene (MEL1) allowed the
selection of false positives (blue colonies) to be carried
out directly on plates with the substrate X-α-GAL (25 µg/
ml, Clontech™), as opposed to the filter assay required for
strains with β-galactosidase gene as a reporter.
Further characterisation of positive clones
Standard techniques were used for the manipulation of
yeast cells (Yeast Protocols Handbook, PT3024-1, Clontech™ and as described elsewhere). Clones were grouped
based on the length of PCR fragments obtained with T7
and 3' AD sequencing primers (pGADT7 vector information, PT3249-5, Clontech™) and restriction analysis of
fragments with the same length. Yeast DNA of selected
representatives of subgroups was transformed by electroporation into the strain DH5α of E. coli, plasmids were
amplified and purified, and inserts were sequenced using
T7 and 3'AD primers (pGADT7-Rec vector information,
PT3530-5, Clontech™). In some cases, protein-DNA interactions were confirmed by retransformation of the
reporter and control strains.

Multiple alignments of related protein sequences and the
resulting dendograms (Fig. 4) were calculated using
AlignX (Vector NTI Suite; Invitrogen, VIC, Australia). The
Clustal W algorithm was used, with a gap opening penalty
of 10 and a gap extension penalty of 0.05.
Real Time PCR
Q-PCR was carried out according to [53] using the primer
combinations shown in Table 2. The raw expression of the
genes of interest was normalised with respect to the
expression of a combination of three control genes, Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate
Dehydrogenase
(GAPdH),
Cyclophilin (CyP) and Elongation factor alpha (eF-1
alpha) after the manner of [54].
