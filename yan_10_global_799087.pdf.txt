Abstract
Background: Biological nitrogen fixation is highly controlled at the transcriptional level by regulatory networks
that respond to the availability of fixed nitrogen. In many diazotrophs, addition of excess ammonium in the
growth medium results in immediate repression of nif gene transcription. Although the regulatory cascades that
control the transcription of the nif genes in proteobacteria have been well investigated, there are limited data on
the kinetics of ammonium-dependent repression of nitrogen fixation.
Results: Here we report a global transcriptional profiling analysis of nitrogen fixation and ammonium repression in
Pseudomonas stutzeri A1501, a root-associated and nitrogen-fixing bacterium. A total of 166 genes, including those
coding for the global nitrogen regulation (Ntr) and Nif-specific regulatory proteins, were upregulated under
nitrogen fixation conditions but rapidly downregulated as early as 10 min after ammonium shock. Among these
nitrogen fixation-inducible genes, 95 have orthologs in each of Azoarcus sp. BH72 and Azotobacter vinelandii AvoP.
In particular, a 49-kb expression island containing nif and other associated genes was markedly downregulated by
ammonium shock. Further functional characterization of pnfA, a new NifA-s54-dependent gene chromosomally
linked to nifHDK, is reported. This gene encodes a protein product with an amino acid sequence similar to that of
five hypothetical proteins found only in diazotrophic strains. No noticeable differences in the transcription of
nifHDK were detected between the wild type strain and pnfA mutant. However, the mutant strain exhibited a
significant decrease in nitrogenase activity under microaerobic conditions and lost its ability to use nitrate as a
terminal electron acceptor for the support of nitrogen fixation under anaerobic conditions.
Conclusions: Based on our results, we conclude that transcriptional regulation of nif gene expression in A1501 is
mediated by the nif-specific and ntr gene regulatory systems. Furthermore, microarray and mutational analyses
revealed that many genes of unknown function may play some essential roles in controlling the expression or
activity of nitrogenase. The findings presented here establish the foundation for further studies on the
physiological function of nitrogen fixation-inducible genes.

Background
Biological nitrogen fixation, a process utilized only by
certain prokaryotes, is catalyzed by a two-component
nitrogenase complex [1]. Nitrogen-fixing microorganisms
colonize a wide variety of habitats and can be found freeliving in soils and water, in association with grasses, or in

root-nodule symbioses with legumes. Consequently, they
have evolved sophisticated regulatory networks that
respond to multiple environmental cues [2]. Fixed nitrogen, such as ammonium, is one of the most important
environmental signals that regulate nitrogen fixation.
Regulation of nif gene expression has been most extensively studied in diazotrophic proteobacteria [3]. It is
becoming increasingly apparent that the genes necessary
for nitrogen fixation in many diazotrophs have common
structures and functions. However, the mechanisms by
which cellular nitrogen levels are sensed and nitrogen

signals are transmitted can vary considerably among different nitrogen-fixing bacteria [4].
The availability of diazotrophic genome data can provide insights into the gene regulatory network of nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Whole-genome microarray platforms
are appropriate for the study on the environmental
responses and the global regulation of diazotrophs. For
example, this approach was used to analyze the genes
that regulate nitrogen fixation and Fe (III) reduction in
Geobacter sulfurreducens [5]; analyze the general stress
responses of A. vinelandii during the carbon and nitrogen diauxic shift [6]; perform transcriptome analysis of
Sinorhizobium meliloti during symbiosis [7]; identify
expression islands clustered on the symbiosis island of
the Mesorhizobium loti genome [8]; and perform transcriptomic studies of Bradyrhizobium japonicum in the
bacteroid state [9] and during chemoautotrophic growth
[10]. In addition, Rediers et al. [11] demonstrated the
successful application of a dap-based in vivo expression
technology selection strategy to identify P. stutzeri
A1501 genes that are switched on during rice root colonization and off during free-living growth. An analysis
of NifA-dependent transcription patterns using a competitive hybridization method led to the identification of
three novel NifA-regulated genes (nrgA, nrgB, and nrgC)
in the symbiotic region of B. japonicum [12]. Collectively, these data suggest that a large fraction of the proteins potentially involved in the control of nitrogen
fixation remain uncharacterized. We believe that a more
complete characterization of these genes will shed light
on the underlying molecular mechanisms of nitrogen
fixation and contribute to our understanding of the evolution of nitrogen-fixing bacteria.
A1501 is a versatile soil bacterium that exhibits the
unusual feature, for a Pseudomonas, of being capable of
nitrogen fixation, and it is capable of endophytic association with rice plants [11,13-19]. This strain has
received particular attention because of its specific metabolic properties, which include denitrification under
anaerobic conditions, nitrification under aerobic conditions, and nitrogen fixation under microaerophilic conditions [14]. The association of A1501 with crop plants
is a promising model system for the study of plantmicrobe-soil interactions in the rhizosphere. The
response of bacteria to fixed nitrogen has often been
studied after short-term exposure to excess ammonium
concentrations, which we refer to as ammonium shock.
Although the genetic and physiological responses to
fixed nitrogen concentrations have been well studied in
A1501 and other diazotrophic strains, the response of
nitrogen-fixing bacteria to ammonium shock has not yet
been examined using DNA microarray analysis. In an
effort to better understand the transcriptional regulation
of nif gene expression, we took advantage of the

availability of the complete genome sequence of A1501
to construct a genomic array system that we used to
profile the global transcription of A1501 under nitrogen
fixation and ammonium shock conditions. We identified
255 upregulated genes under nitrogen fixation conditions, 166 of which were found to be collectively downregulated as early as 10 min after ammonium shock.
Among these nitrogen fixation-inducible genes, 95 have
orthologs in Azoarcus sp. BH72 and A. vinelandii AvoP.
Finally, we identified a new gene, termed pnfA, which
might play a role in the control of nitrogenase activity.

Results
Overview of expression profiling analysis

We previously investigated the global gene expression
profile of A1501 under nitrogen fixation and nitrogen
excess conditions and identified a total of 549 genes
that exhibited more than a two-fold change in expression under nitrogen fixation conditions [20]. Among
these genes, the expression of 255 genes was dramatically enhanced and the expression of 294 genes was
strongly repressed (see Additional file 1). The upregulated genes mainly belonged to three different functional
categories: nitrogen metabolism-related genes, including
a set of nitrogen fixation-related genes; a large number
of genes encoding transporter and membrane proteins;
and genes with unknown function. Note that 46
hypothetical genes, covering 20% of all the up-regulated
genes, were upregulated under nitrogen fixation conditions; however, the physiological significance of these
genes is unknown.
To identify genes that are differentially expressed in
response to changes in nitrogen availability, we used a
whole-genome DNA microarray and real-time RT-PCR
to analyze global transcription under nitrogen fixation
and nitrogen-excess conditions. The expression of 429
genes was significantly altered under ammonium shock
conditions compared to nitrogen fixation conditions,
including 186 genes whose expression was downregulated and 243 genes whose expression was upregulated.
These alterations in gene expression are summarized in
Additional file 2. A large percentage of upregulated
genes were associated with growth rate and included
those involved in information storage and processing
(e.g., DNA replication, recombination, and repair; transcription and translation; and ribosomal structure and
biogenesis). In addition, genes associated with energy
production/conversion and nutrition-related metabolism
(e.g., amino acid, nucleotide, lipid, and coenzyme metabolism) were also significantly upregulated. Short exposure of the bacteria to excess ammonia induced the
expression of various genes for translation apparatus,
including forty-four genes encoding many ribosomal
proteins, three genes (rpoA, rpoB, and rpoZ) encoding

the DNA-directed RNA polymerase, and five genes
encoding protein translation factors (infAB, tsf, tuf, efp,
and greA) and the ribosome-binding factor (rbfA). The
rapid increase in expression of these genes was first
observed after 10 min of ammonium shock, whereas the
levels of expression of most other known genes responsible for growth and metabolism were not significantly
changed. Thus, our results indicate that upon shortterm exposure of A1501 to excess ammonium, the
increase in the expression of ribosomal protein-associated genes precedes the increase in the expression of
most genes required for growth.
Identification of genes induced specifically under
nitrogen fixation conditions

An analysis of the phylogenetic relationship between
A1501 and other diazotrophic strains based on comparison of 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that A1501 is
most closely related to A. vinelandii AvoP and Azoarcus
sp. BH72. This finding is consistent with results from
the phylogenetic analysis based on NifH proteins of diazotrophic strains (data not shown). In this study, we
found that 166 genes were upregulated under nitrogen
fixation conditions but were rapidly downregulated as
early as 10 min after ammonium shock, indicating a regulon of nitrogen fixation-inducible genes in A1501 (for a
detailed description, see Additional file 3). Genomic
sequence data for the three most closely related diazotrophic bacterial species, A1501, A. vinelandii AvoP, and
Azoarcus sp. BH72, are publicly available [20-22]. Thus,
studies of the A1501 regulon genes shared by the three
related diazotrophic strains allowed us to delineate a
core subset of nitrogen fixation-inducible genes. Among
these genes identified in A1501, 95 have orthologs in
Azoarcus sp. BH72 and A. vinelandii AvoP. We therefore designated these 95 genes as part of the core subset
of the regulon induced specifically under nitrogen fixation conditions (Figure 1A). The core subset can be
classified into several functional categories, and the relative occurrence of genes belonging to each category is
shown in Figure 1B. In addition to the nif genes (20%)
which are directly involved in the synthesis, maturation,
and function of nitrogenase, there are other core genes
that encode four major functional groups of proteins,
including transcriptional, regulatory, and signal transduction proteins (7%); transport proteins and metabolic
enzymes (39%); proteins involved in energy production
and conversion (16%); and proteins of unknown function (16%). Note that a very high proportion of the proteins involved in energy metabolism are induced under
nitrogen fixation conditions, which is in accordance
with the well-known fact that biological nitrogen fixation is a highly energy-dependent process, requiring
large amounts of both reducing power and ATP. The
detailed implications of the changes in protein

expression levels will be determined in the future. When
more genomic sequence data of other root-associated
diazotrophs becomes available, the current list of 95
genes in the core subset will further decrease.
Transcriptional analysis of the nitrogen fixation island in
A1501

In our previous study, a group of genes (PST1302 to
PST1359) located contiguously in the A1501 genome
was defined as a nitrogen fixation island [20]. This cluster represents the largest assembly of genes responsible
for the synthesis, maturation, and function of the nitrogenase complex that has been characterized in any freeliving diazotrophic species to date. Genes in this region
had the highest transcription levels (>10-fold compared
to almost all the nif genes) under nitrogen fixation conditions and were remarkably downregulated by ammonium shock (Figure 2A, Table 1). These results, together

Yan et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:11
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/11

with the observation that genes outside the island are
downregulated under nitrogen fixation conditions (Figure 2A), indicate that the nitrogen fixation island functions to support nitrogen fixation. Similar findings were
reported in a previous study in which expression islands
were shown to be clustered on a large symbiosis island
of the M. loti genome [8].
The s54 factor (or RpoN) is a well-known alternative
factor for RNA polymerase that enables the transcription of nif genes in conjunction with the transcriptional
activator NifA or activates other genes involved in nitrogen metabolism and other functions with NtrC, PspF,
DctD [23]. To identify putative s54-dependent operons,
the promoter regions of the regulon genes induced specifically under nitrogen fixation conditions were
searched in silico for the presence of a -24/-12 promoter
sequence. As anticipated, a very high proportion of the
regulon genes had a s54 consensus promoter (Additional
file 3). This result is in agreement with the fact that s54
is a global regulator that is involved in a complex transcriptional network that controls a large variety of cellular processes [24,25]. As described above, the expression
of the nif genes is known to be controlled by a common
mechanism in diazotrophic Proteobacteria. In this
mechanism, NifA recognizes an upstream activator
sequence (TGT-N10-ACA) usually located at least 100bp upstream of the transcription initiation site [26,27].
Promoter sequence analysis of genes within the island
indicated that a total of 52 genes are organized into 11
putative NifA-s54-dependent operons (Figure 2B). These
include the nifLA cluster, which encodes negative and
positive regulators; the rnfABCDGEF cluster, which
encodes the subunits of a membrane-bound protein
complex involved in electron transport to nitrogenase;
the nifHDK cluster, which encodes dinitrogenase reductase (NifH) and dinitrogenase (NifDK); the nifENX cluster, which is involved in the synthesis of the ironmolybdenum cofactor of nitrogenase (FeMo-co); and the
molybdate transport genes modAB. In order to substantiate the in silico predictions of the NifA-s54-dependent promoters, we compared transcriptional level
expression of the 11 operons between the wild type
strain and the nifA or rpoN mutants by quantitative RTPCR. Under nitrogen fixation conditions, the expression
of the 11 predicted NifA-s 54 -dependent operons was
upregulated up to 10-fold in the wild type strain but
was almost completely repressed in the nifA and rpoN
mutants (data not shown). Our data indicate that the 11
operons in the island are activated in a NifA-s54-dependent manner under nitrogen fixation conditions.
Inactivation of selected nitrogen fixation-inducible genes

Biological nitrogen fixation is an oxygen-sensitive and
energy-dependent process that requires ATP and a supply of Fe-S clusters not only for the nitrogenase

components but also for many other proteins involved
in electron transfer, redox and non-redox catalysis, and
sensing of regulatory processes. Our previous study
demonstrated that mutation of 16 genes within the
nitrogen fixation island led to a decrease in nitrogenase
activity. However, the role of these genes in nitrogen
fixation remained hypothetical due to the lack of further
genetic and physiological characterization [20]. In the
present study, we performed a global transcriptional
profiling analysis of nitrogen fixation and ammonium
repression in A1501 and identified a regulon of genes
induced specifically under nitrogen fixation conditions.
Among the regulon genes, 52 were located in the nitrogen fixation island, whereas 114 were located outside
the island. Many of the regulon genes encode previously
uncharacterized proteins, such as transcriptional regulators or outer membrane proteins. To identify their physiological roles, we inactivated nine regulon genes by
homologous suicide plasmid integration. The nitrogenase activities of the corresponding mutant strains were
determined and are summarized in Table 2. Mutation of
PST3417 and PST4084, which encode a predicted transcriptional regulator and a predicted signal transduction
protein, respectively, led to a significant decrease in
nitrogenase activity. PST0874 encodes a predicted chemotactic transducer. We constructed a mutant that carried a defective PST0874 gene and found that the
mutant strain displayed 57% of intact wild type nitrogenase activity (Table 2). Our results suggest that these
previously uncharacterized genes, although not essential,
are required for full nitrogenase activity. However, the
possible role of these genes in electron transfer, redox
and non-redox catalysis, and sensing of regulatory processes requires further investigation.
Functional analysis of a new nitrogen fixation gene

On the basis of the above observations, we speculate that
some as yet unknown genes may be involved in nitrogen
fixation. Upon searching for such genes, a new NifA-s54dependent gene, termed pnfA, was identified. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that the A1501 PnfA protein and
related proteins in other microorganisms can be classified
into two distinct subfamilies (Figure 3). The PnfA protein
and its five homologs comprised the first subfamily. Ten
hypothetical proteins, with 20% identity to the A1501
PnfA, comprised the second subfamily. The A1501 pnfA
gene encodes a 31.7-kDa protein with high amino acid
sequence similarity to five hypothetical proteins found
only in diazotrophic strains, namely P. azotifigens (92%
identity), A. vinelandii AvoP (72% identity), Azoarcus sp.
BH72 (55% identity), Dechloromonas aromatica RCB
(54% identity), and Halorhodospira halophila SL1 (49%
identity), suggesting that it may be a diazotroph-specific
protein. The pnfA gene is chromosomally linked to
nifHDK and is transcribed in the opposite orientation

of 1645 ± 169 nmol ethylene/min/mg protein. Nitrogenase activity was examined under nitrogen fixation conditions (0.1 mM ammonium and 0.5% oxygen
tension). Data are expressed as the means of three independent experiments.

(Figure 4). Sequence analysis of the nifH-pnfA intergenic
region revealed a putative -24/-12 promoter sequence
and the upstream activator sequence TGT-N 10 -ACA
(Figure 5). These data, together with the experimental
evidence obtained from quantitative RT-PCR analysis,
led us to conclude that pnfA is activated in a NifA-s54dependent manner, a characteristic feature for activation
of the well-known nif genes under nitrogen fixation conditions (Figure 6A).

To investigate its biological function, a non-polar
mutant of pnfA was constructed, and the effect of this
mutation on the expression and activity of nitrogenase
under nitrogen fixation conditions was studied. No significant difference in the transcriptional levels of nifH
was observed between the wild type and pnfA mutant
under nitrogen fixation conditions, suggesting that PnfA
does not have any regulatory role in the transcription of
nifHDK (Figure 6B). Complementation of the pnfA

mutant with pVK100-1325, in which the expression of
pnfA was monitored from the km promoter, restored
the activity of nitrogenase to wild type levels (data not
shown). However, the non-polar mutant strain displayed
much lower nitrogenase activity than the wild type
strain under nitrogen fixation conditions (0.1 mM
ammonium and 0.5% oxygen tension) (Figure 6C), suggesting that PnfA is necessary for maximal nitrogenase
activity.
To further determine the function of the new gene, we
determined the effects of PnfA inactivation on nitrogenase activity under different oxygen concentrations, especially under anaerobic conditions using nitrate as the
terminal electron acceptor. The incubation chamber was
thoroughly flushed with pure argon gas to generate an
anaerobic environment. As shown in Figure 6C, the
activity of wild type nitrogenase was much lower under
anaerobic conditions than under microaerobic conditions. In contrast to its activity under microaerobic conditions, the nitrogenase activity of mutant A1325 was
similar to that observed in the wild type strain under
anaerobic conditions, suggesting that PnfA regulates the
activity of nitrogenase under miocroaerobic but not
anaerobic conditions. Upon increasing the concentration
of oxygen from 0 to 1%, a remarkable decrease in the
percentage of nitrogenase activity was observed in the
mutant and wild type strains (Figure 6C). Note that the
nitrogenase activity of A1501 led to the production of
approximately 600 μmol ethylene/mg of protein when
the bacteria were grown under anaerobic conditions in
nitrogen-free medium supplemented with 1 mM nitrate
(Figure 6D). This activity was much higher than that
observed for the pnfA mutant. Obviously, the mutant
loses its ability to fix nitrogen under anaerobic conditions when nitrate serves as the terminal electron acceptor. Overall, these results, together with the finding that
PnfA contains an amino acid sequence with approximately 31% identity to the equivalent region from the

universal stress protein A or the electron transfer flavoprotein alpha subunit-like protein, led us to conclude
that the PnfA protein is involved in nitrogen fixation
processes, such as electron transfer to nitrogenase or
oxygen protection mechanisms.

Discussion
Nitrogen fixation is tightly regulated at the transcriptional and post-translational levels [2]. The first checkpoint occurs at the level of the nif-specific NifA-NifL
interaction, which is controlled by the Ntr systems [28].
The second checkpoint occurs upon reversible inactivation of nitrogenase by dinitrogenase reductase ADPribosyltransferase (DraT) and dinitrogenase reductase
glycohydrolase (DraG) [29]. In many diazotrophic g-Proteobacteria, such as in K. pneumoniae, A. vinelandii,
and P. stutzeri, the s54-dependent activator NifA activates the expression of all the nif genes, and the antiactivator NifL controls NifA activity via protein-protein
interactions in response to fixed nitrogen status
[18,30,31]. Different regulatory mechanisms at the transcriptional level have been documented in several diazotrophs, such as in the a-Proteobacteria A. brasilense,
which lacks nifL [32]. PII proteins are key signal transduction proteins involved in the general nitrogen regulation system and are found in diazotrophic
Proteobacteria as two paralogous gene copies, glnB and
glnK [19,33-35]. In K. pneumoniae, the GlnB protein
controls the activity of the NtrB-NtrC regulatory system;
in turn, phosphorylation of NtrC controls the expression
of the alternative PII protein GlnK, as well as of the
NifL and NifA proteins [28]. A1501 carries a single copy
of the glnK gene, similar to A. vinelandii, but lacks glnB,
which is present in K. pneumoniae and A. brasilense
[28,32]. GlnK can interact with NifL to promote the formation of a GlnK-NifL-NifA ternary complex in A. vinelandii and P. stutzeri [19,36]. Here we report a global
transcriptional profiling analysis of nitrogen fixation and

DNA microarray. The results show that among the
nitrogen fixation-inducible genes in A1501, including
those involved in the Ntr and nif-specific regulatory systems, 95 have orthologs in Azoarcus sp. BH72 and A.
vinelandii AvoP. This type of detailed global analysis
had not been done before. Our results suggest the existence of similar regulatory mechanisms that control

expression of nitrogen fixation genes in the three most
closely related diazotrophic strains. Moreover, although
nitrogenase on-off switching was previously reported
[13], DraT and DraG (known to control nitrogenase
ADP ribosylation) have not been found in A1501, suggesting that it possesses an inactivation mechanism different from that reported in Rhodospirillum rubrum
[37], Azoarcus [38], and A. brasilense [39].

Horizontal gene transfer plays an important role in
the evolution of the nitrogen fixation system [40-43].
Baar et al. [44] observed that a gene cluster containing
the nif genes within the genome of Wolinella succinogenes exhibits a high degree of synteny to the cyanobacterial nif gene cluster, implying that the nif genes may
have been acquired by gene transfer. A so-called “symbiosis island” was initially identified in M. loti
ICMP3153 as a transmissible 500-kb DNA element,
which contains all the genes that are likely to be
required for Nod factor, nitrogen fixation, and island
transfer [45]. After years of controversy, it is now established that several strains of Pseudomonas species can
fix nitrogen [14]. However, the sporadic occurrence of
functional nif genes in Pseudomonas spp. raises the
question of their origin [16]. Based on genomic comparisons, the number of genes previously recognized as
being part of the Pseudomonas core genome may be
limited to 1,997 [20]. In the present study, we found
that more than 70% of nitrogen fixation-inducible genes,
including those within the nitrogen fixation island, are
absent from the Pseudomonas core genome. Only 24
nitrogen fixation-inducible genes, such as the ntr genes,
belong to the Pseudomonas core genome (Table 3). Our
data on global transcriptional profiling strongly suggest
that the A1501 nif region is not only a genomic island
but also an expression island. The ntr system exists in
almost all organisms, whereas the nifLA regulatory system is highly specific for nitrogen-fixing bacteria [33,34].
Apparently, A1501 has its own ntr systems and acquired
a nif-specific regulatory system from a diazotrophic
ancestor during its evolution. Consequently, the acquisition of nif genes and cooperative control of two regulatory systems of different evolutionary origins confer
A1501 with the unusual capability to fix nitrogen. However, the consequences of nif island acquisition for the
host and for island function upon entrance into a new
global regulatory network have not been directly
studied.
The rhizosphere is a densely populated area and exerts
a unique influence on microbial activity. Associative
nitrogen fixation is often enhanced in the rhizosphere
compared with bulk soil, because root-associated diazotrophs can utilize more root exudates as carbon and
energy sources. The A1501 genome contains genes
likely to be involved in broad utilization of carbon
sources, nitrogen fixation, denitrification, degradation of
aromatic compounds, the regulation of multiple pathways involved in protection against environmental stresses, and other functions that presumably give A1501 an
advantage in the rhizosphere [20]. The ability to fix
nitrogen is compatible with a wide range of physiologies
including aerobic (for example A. vinelandii), microaerobic (for example P. stutzeri) or anaerobic (for

We further compared the organization of the A1501
nif cluster with that of K. pneumoniae, which exhibits
the highest organization of nif genes identified to date.
The high conservation of the core nif genes between the
two diazotrophic strains suggests that they were
acquired from a common ancestor. Interestingly, we
found that many additional genes, such as pnfA, which
is associated with the core nif genes, are found in A1501
but not exist in K. pneumoniae. From these facts, we
suppose that lateral transfer of the nif genes from a
common ancestor and subsequent acquisition of additional genes occurred to for bacterial adaptation to the
physiology of their respective hosts. In nitrogen-free
semisolid medium, A1501 formed a pellicle under the
surface and exhibited a high level of nitrogenase activity,
suggesting that nitrogen fixation occurs at low oxygen
tension [13]. Under anaerobic conditions, nitrate can
accept the terminal electron transferred from the
respiratory chain, and the energy generated during this
process supports nitrogen fixation in A1501 [46].

Yan et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:11
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/11

However, the genes responsible for the transport of electrons to nitrogenase and for the oxygen protection
mechanisms in A1501 have yet to be determined.
The objective of this study was to explore the utility of
transcriptional profiling as a screening method for identifying previously uncharacterized genes relevant for the
nitrogen fixation processes. In addition, we focused on
elucidating the roles of newly characterized genes in
controlling the expression or activity of nitrogenase. We
first identified a set of hypothetical genes that are
induced under nitrogen fixation conditions and subsequently carried out a functional analysis of these genes.
Consequently, we identified a new gene, referred to as
pnfA, which is chromosomally linked to nifHDK. This
new gene has the following characteristics: (i) like all
known nif genes, it is upregulated exclusively under
nitrogen fixation conditions in a NifA-s 54 -dependent
manner; (ii) it encodes a 31.7-kDa protein with high
similarity to hypothetical proteins present only in nitrogen-fixing bacteria, suggesting that it is a diazotrophspecific protein; (iii) its inactivation results in the inability of bacteria to use nitrate as a terminal electron
acceptor for supporting nitrogen fixation under anaerobic conditions. However, the pnfA mutant can grow on
nitrogen-free semisolid medium, indicating that it has a
Nif+ phenotype (data not shown). Furthermore, a similarity search revealed that a portion of the amino acid
sequence of the PnfA protein (residues 176 to 240) has
approximately 31% identity to equivalent regions from
the UspA domain-containing protein of Mycobacterium
sp. JLS and the electron transfer flavoprotein alpha subunit-like protein of Methylobacterium nodulans ORS
2060. This result suggests that PnfA may play a role in
the transport of electrons to nitrogenase or in the regulation of oxygen protection mechanisms. This finding is
also supported by the observation that homologues of
PnfA are present in many associative or endophytic
nitrogen-fixing bacteria, such as A1501, Azoarcus sp.
BH72, and A. vinelandii AvoP, which usually utilize different strategies for meeting the energy demand of
nitrogen fixation and protecting nitrogenase from oxygen. Further studies on the expression and regulation of
nitrogen fixation-inducible genes in A1501 will provide
useful insights into how the bacterium responds to
environmental cues and how it adapts to rhizosphere
environments.

shock, suggesting the existence of a regulon of genes
that are induced specifically under nitrogen fixation
conditions. Strikingly, we found that a 49-kb cluster of
all nif and associated genes was markedly upregulated as
an expression island, whereas genes outside the island
were downregulated under nitrogen fixation conditions.
Furthermore, we identified a new NifA-s54-dependent
gene, termed pnfA, which is located within the expression island and may be involved in the nitrogen fixation
processes. The implications of our functional and evolutionary analyses of the nitrogen fixation island and the
pnfA gene in root-associated and nitrogen-fixing bacteria are discussed.

Methods
Bacterial strains and growth conditions

P. stutzeri A1501 and the mutant derivatives were grown
at 30°C in Luria-Bertani medium or in minimal lactatecontaining medium (medium K) as described previously
[13]. Kanamycin (Km) was added to the medium at a concentration of 50 μg/mL as required. A1501 was cultured
under two growth conditions: nitrogen fixation conditions
(0.1 mM ammonium and 0.5% oxygen tension) and nitrogen-excess conditions (20 mM ammonium and 0.5% oxygen tension). For expression assays, A1501 was exposed to
ammonium shock for 10 min, which involved a sudden
change from nitrogen fixation to ammonium shock conditions by addition of 20 mM ammonium. We verified that
no discernible loss of ammonium occurred after the
shock. The activity of nitrogenase in A1501 is completely
repressed by 20 mM ammonium.
Microarray analysis

Microarray fabrication, cDNA synthesis, labeling, hybridization, and analysis of the data were conducted as
described previously [20].
Quantitative real-time PCR analysis

Quantitative RT-PCR experiments were performed as
described previously [20] and according to the manufacturer’s recommendations using the RG6000 Q-PCR
thermocycler (Corbett Research, Mortlake, NSW, Australia) and the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
Construction of non-polar mutants

Uncharacterized genes were inactivated by homologous
suicide plasmid integration as described previously [47]
using pK18 mob as the vector [48].
Nitrogenase activity assays

Conclusions
In the present study, we performed a global transcriptional profiling analysis of nitrogen fixation and ammonium repression in P. stutzeri A1501 using a wholegenome DNA microarray. In total, 166 genes were upregulated under nitrogen fixation conditions and rapidly
downregulated as early as 10 min after ammonium

To examine the activity of nitrogenase, bacterial suspensions were incubated in N-free minimal medium at an
OD600 of 0.1 at 30°C under an argon atmosphere containing oxygen at different concentrations and acetylene
at 10% according to the protocol described by Desnoues
et al. [13]. After the concentration of oxygen was
adjusted to 0, 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0%, acetylene was injected,

and gas samples were withdrawn periodically for gas
chromatographic analysis of ethylene production. Under
anaerobic conditions, the activity of nitrogenase was
analyzed by incubating bacterial suspensions in N-free
minimal lactate medium supplemented with 1 mM
nitrate at an OD600 of 0.1. The specific activity of nitrogenase was expressed as nmol ethylene/min/mg protein.
Protein concentrations were determined using a standard protein assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) with bovine
serum albumin as the standard. Each experiment was
repeated at least three times.
