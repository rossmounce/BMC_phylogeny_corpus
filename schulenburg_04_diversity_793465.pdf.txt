Abstract
Background: Co-evolutionary arms races between parasites and hosts are considered to be of
immense importance in the evolution of living organisms, potentially leading to highly dynamic lifehistory changes. The outcome of such arms races is in many cases thought to be determined by
frequency dependent selection, which relies on genetic variation in host susceptibility and parasite
virulence, and also genotype-specific interactions between host and parasite. Empirical evidence for
these two prerequisites is scarce, however, especially for invertebrate hosts. We addressed this
topic by analysing the interaction between natural isolates of the soil nematode Caenorhabditis
elegans and the pathogenic soil bacterium Serratia marcescens.
Results: Our analysis reveals the presence of i) significant variation in host susceptibility, ii)
significant variation in pathogen virulence, and iii) significant strain- and genotype-specific
interactions between the two species.
Conclusions: The results obtained support the previous notion that highly specific interactions
between parasites and animal hosts are generally widespread. At least for C. elegans, the high
specificity is observed among isolates from the same population, such that it may provide a basis
for and/or represent the outcome of co-evolutionary adaptations under natural conditions. Since
both C. elegans and S. marcescens permit comprehensive molecular analyses, these two species
provide a promising model system for inference of the molecular basis of such highly specific
interactions, which are as yet unexplored in invertebrate hosts.

Background
By definition, parasites have a negative effect on host fitness. Since parasites usually show a shorter generation
time than their hosts, they are also able to adapt rapidly to
newly arising host genotypes. Both characteristics together
select for hosts with efficient counter-adaptations. Subsequently, parasites are favoured if they can circumvent
these host countermeasures. Such interactions may result

in a co-evolutionary arms race, consisting of repeated
cycles of the emergence of new parasite offences and host
countermeasures. Hence, parasite-host interactions can
lead to extremely rapid evolutionary change [1,2]. As
such, they are thought to be responsible for much of the
complexity found in the immune system of animals [3].
They are also likely to account for the evolution of diverse
genetic mechanisms, which aid in generating fast changes,

including sexual reproduction and recombination [4,5].
They may also affect the evolution of other life-history
traits, such as reproductive rate, longevity, or competitive
ability, which compete for available resources with
defence and virulence traits in host and parasite, respectively [6,7].
Co-evolutionary arms races between hosts and parasites
(meaning here eukaryotic organisms, bacterial pathogens,
and viruses that gain a fitness advantage from infecting
and harming a host) are in many cases assumed to be
determined by negative frequency dependent selection. In
particular, rare parasite and host genotypes should be at
an advantage because commonness facilitates evolution
of host or parasite counter-adaptations, respectively [4,5].
Such frequency dependent dynamics rely on two important conditions: i) natural genetic variation in both host
resistance and parasite virulence, and ii) natural genotypespecific interactions between hosts and parasites [1,4].
Empirical evidence for the presence of both of these prerequisites is still rare, especially for invertebrate hosts
[8,9]. They include various associations between snails
and trematodes (e.g., Potamopyrgus antipodarum versus
Microphallus [10] or Bulinus globosus versus Schistosoma
[11]), the association between the waterflea Daphnia
magna and its microparasite Pasteuria ramosa [8], between
Drosophila melanogaster and its parasitoid Asobara tabida
[12], between the bumble bee Bombus terrestris and the
trypanosome Crithidia bombi [13], or between the copepod Macrocyclops albidus and the cestode Schistocephalus
solidus [14]. Clearly, more data is needed to determine the
importance of parasite-mediated co-evolutionary arms
races in nature.
In this study, we evaluated differences in host resistance
and parasite virulence, both defined in a broad sense and
reciprocally as the effect of an infection on host condition
(i.e. alive, morbid, or dead). In particular, we tested the
presence of genetic variation and also the presence of
strain- and genotype-specific interactions during the infection of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (Nematoda:
Rhabditidae) by the Gram-negative bacterium Serratia
marcescens (Enterobacteriaceae). C. elegans has recently
been established as a model to study parasite-host interactions and in particular the genetics of host defence [1517]. It is a soil inhabitant found in almost all temperate
regions of the world. It seems to be common in decomposing material, where it feeds on diverse microorganisms
[18,19]. About 50 natural strains are currently available.
These strains are genetically very diverse, even when isolated from populations at a single location [18,19]. They
also differ in many life-history traits, including their
response towards the potential parasite Bacillus thuringiensis [20]. The parasites that C. elegans encounters under natural conditions have not yet been unambiguously

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/49

identified. The ubiquitous soil-dwelling bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa, B. thuringiensis and S. marcescens are
all likely candidates [17]. For our study, we chose S. marcescens, recently adopted as a model to study the genetic
basis of virulence [15,21], as a pathogen as it is able to
produce a persistent infection and it is likely to benefit
from the infection [22], thus behaving as a true parasite of
the nematode.

Results
In our main experiment, we compared the consequences
of infection of eight different natural C. elegans strains
with 5 different S. marcescens strains plus one control
(heat-killed bacteria of S. marcescens Db11, a strain for
which the genome sequence is now complete). The C. elegans strains were isolated from Münster, in Northwest
Germany, and belong to four different microsatellite genotypes [18]. The S. marcescens strains originate from different locations around the world. The interaction between
the two species was examined with the help of a survival
assay, in which the survival of individual worms was
monitored in the presence of a defined concentration of
bacteria [20]. The survival assay was performed in 96-well
plates on five occasions (runs). During each run, all possible bacterial and worm strain combinations were
assayed in parallel, resulting in a total of 16 data points
per factor combination per run and 80 data points per factor combination in total.
80 out of a total 3840 cases (2.08%) had to be excluded
because of errors during automated worm-transfer (either
no worm or more than one worm per well), resulting in
between 75 and 80 usable data points per combination of
worm and bacterial strains. The number of valid cases did
not differ significantly among these factor combinations
(likelihood ratio test [LRT], χ2 = 0.904, d.f. = 35, P >
0.999). In the control (worms with dead S. marcescens
Db11), only 12 out of 625 were not found in the category
"alive" (1.92%). Of these, 9 were morbid and 3 were
dead. The recorded number of live worms per strain did
not differ significantly from 100% (LRT, χ2 = 0.455, d.f. =
7, P > 0.999). It also did not differ significantly among the
worm strains (LRT, χ2 = 0.416, d.f. = 7, P > 0.999). These
results show that the experimental set-up itself does not
cause significant levels of dead or morbid worms and that
it does not have a different effect on different worm
strains.
The different C. elegans strains show substantial differences as to their ability to survive in the presence of pathogenic S. marcescens (Fig. 1). In general, the strains MY6
and MY18 were most resistant, whereas MY14 and MY15
were most susceptible. Moreover, the strains with identical microsatellite genotypes generally produce similar but
not identical levels of resistance. This suggests that these

Treatment response for the different bacterial and
worm strain combinations of the main experiment.
The response is expressed as host condition (values for the
whole experiment), such that the black area refers to the
proportion of dead worms, grey to the proportion of morbid, and white to the proportion of live worms. For C. elegans, both strain (bottom line) and genotype (top line)

strains bear additional genetic differences, which were not
resolved by microsatellite genotyping. At the same time,
the different S. marcescens strains differ considerably in
their effect on C. elegans (Fig. 1). Here, strain Sm2170 was
most virulent, whereas strains Sma3 and Sma13 generally
produced the fewest cases of mortality and morbidity.
Since S. marcescens strains were grown under identical
conditions and since some of them are already known to
differ in phenotype (e.g. red pigmentation), the observed
differences are most likely determined genetically. Most
interestingly, the interaction between specific worm and
bacterial strains seems to differ across the table. For
instance, C. elegans strain MY10 is more susceptible to S.
marcescens strain Sma13 than to ATCC274, whereas the
opposite is true for C. elegans strain MY20 (Fig. 1). Similarly, host strain MY15 is more susceptible to pathogen
strain ATCC274 than to strain Db11, whereas the pattern
is reversed for almost all other host strains (Fig. 1).
In general consistency with these observations, ordinal
logistic regression (OLR) analysis indicates a significant
effect of the factors bacterial strain, worm strain or genotype, the interaction between the two, and also experimental run on the treatment response (Table 1). The two
respective models employed are significantly better than

Ordinal logistic regression was based on a model, which contained
bacterial strain, worm strain (alternatively worm genotype), the

strain and worm strain/genotype as factors. The importance of

strain as factor: LRT, χ2 = 1285.63, d.f. = 199, P < 0.0001;
model including worm microsatellite genotype as factor:
LRT, χ2 = 854.55, d.f. = 99, P < 0.0001). However, they are
both significantly worse than the respective saturated
models (model including worm strain: LRT, χ2 = 491.32,
d.f. = 199, P < 0.0001; model including worm genotype:
LRT, χ2 = 442.94, d.f. = 99, P < 0.0001). The latter test
examines whether the model employed considers a sufficient number of factors or factor combinations to explain
the variation found in the data. The results suggest that the
model is not sufficiently complex. We decided against
employing more complex models (e.g. consideration of
host genotype nested in host strain in a single model),
because the response variable is ordinal with only three
categories (alive, morbid, dead), such that a larger
number of predictor variables in the model would most
likely lead to highly increased random error in the regression analysis. Thus, as an alternative, we analysed the data
using association tests.
Two-way associations were analysed with the LRT. The
results show a significant effect of either of the different
factors on worm condition (Table 2). The relevance of
these associations was further examined by taking into
account a second predictor variable using the CochranMantel-Haenszel (CMH) test of conditional independence. All previously identified associations remained significant, irrespective of the second predictor variable
considered (Table 2). The only exception refers to the case
where the factor worm strain was corrected by the factor
worm genotype, suggesting that the observed variation
among C. elegans strains is due to differences in genotypic
composition. The remaining results indicate that the

significant effect from one of the factors on the treatment
response is independent of the significant effect from one
of the other factors. This finding is consistent with the
presence of an interaction effect from the factors bacterial
strain and nematode strain/genotype, as above suggested
by OLR.
In the second experiment, we specifically addressed the
presence of an interaction between two bacterial strains
(Db11, ATCC274) and four host strains (MY8, MY10,
MY14, MY15), the latter belonging to two different host
genotypes. For this experiment, all factor combinations
were included in each 96-well plate and in one experimental run. Only 7 out of 384 cases had to be excluded for
the reasons given above (1.82%), resulting in 46 to 48
data points per factor combination. Again, the number of
valid cases did not differ among factor combinations
(LRT, χ2 = 0.093, d.f. = 3, P = 0.996). In the control treatment of this experiment, all animals were alive.
The second experiment confirmed the presence of variation in host resistance and pathogen virulence, although
the overall level of virulence was lower than in the main
experiment (Fig. 2). Subsequent OLR revealed a significant effect from the factor worm strain or worm genotype,
and also the interaction between the bacterial strain and
either worm strain or genotype. The effect of bacterial
strains was significant before Dunn-Sidák adjustment of
significance levels (due to multiple testing), but insignificant afterwards (Table 3). For these OLR analyses, the

models employed were significantly better than a model
without any predictors (model including worm strain as
factor: LRT, χ2 = 62.29, d.f. = 7, P < 0.0001; model including worm microsatellite genotype as factor: LRT, χ2 =
59.12, d.f. = 3, P < 0.0001). Moreover, they were not significantly worse than the respective saturated models
(model including worm strain: LRT, χ2 = 4.62, d.f. = 7, P =
0.7060; model including worm genotype: LRT, χ2 = 1.32,
d.f. = 3, P = 0.7238), suggesting that they contained sufficient details to explain the observed variation.
Subsequent performance of association tests generally
corroborated the OLR analyses: The different predictor
variables had a significant effect on the treatment
response (LRT analysis in Table 4). With two exceptions,
this was still true after correcting for one of the other predictors (CMH tests in Table 4). One of the exceptions
refers to the factor bacterial strain, which no longer produced a significant effect if corrected by any of the other
factors. This is in agreement with results from the OLR
analysis. The other case shows that the factor worm strain
becomes insignificant if corrected by worm genotype,
which confirms the findings for the main experiment (see
above). Consequently, the results clearly demonstrate that
there are significant differences among host genotypes
and, most importantly, that there are significant strain- or
genotype-specific interactions between the two species.

Discussion
We here provide evidence for the presence of i) genetic differences in resistance among natural C. elegans strains, ii)
genetic differences in virulence among natural S. marces-

cens strains, and also iii) strain- or genotype-specific interactions between the two. The first of these points is
generally consistent with our previous results on the presence of strain-specific differences in resistance of C. elegans
towards Bacillus thuringiensis [20]. However, in the previous study, we compared C. elegans strains from different
locations across the world, whereas in the present study
all strains derive from the same place (the town of Münster in Northwest Germany) [18]. Previous microsatellite
genotyping demonstrated that these strains are genetically
extremely diverse [18]. Our present results highlight the
fact that genetic diversity translates into phenotypic differences in resistance. Importantly, as these differences are
present in one population, they could provide the basis
for and/or represent the outcome of evolution under natural conditions. These conclusions are restricted to the

host C. elegans, because the S. marcescens strains considered did not come from the same location.
The observed strain- and genotype-specific interactions
represent an important precondition for negative frequency dependent selection. As such, they may contribute
to the emergence of co-evolutionary arms races [1,4]. The
relevance of our results for the association between C. elegans and S. marcescens in the wild must currently be
considered unclear. To date, it is unknown whether the
two species indeed co-exist under natural conditions, even
though it is strongly suggested by the fact that both – especially S. marcescens – are common soil inhabitants
[19,23]. If they do co-exist, they clearly show the potential
to engage in co-evolutionary interactions. In fact, in this
case, the observed specificity may represent a signature of
past counter-adaptations. Our results would then also
suggest that such highly specific interactions are widespread among invertebrate hosts; they are currently only
known in a few arthropods and molluscs (see the background section for examples).
The situation is clearly different if the two species do not
share the same natural habitat. In this case, the observed
specificity must be the result of independent adaptations
of parasite and host strains to other environmental conditions. Pleiotropy of such adaptations should then have
produced the specific C. elegans-S. marcescens interactions
as a side effect. For example, the C. elegans strains may
have adapted differently towards environmental toxins. If
the underlying detoxification mechanisms are also
employed in the defence against pathogens, then this may
result in the observed differences in resistance. Such
mechanisms could indeed be of relevance in the interaction with S. marcescens, for which at least one toxin
(hemolysin ShlA) was previously suggested to contribute
to pathogenesis in C. elegans [22]. Moreover, such mechanisms may also account for highly specific interactions,
even if the two species did co-exist in the wild, underlining the idea that past co-evolutionary events cannot be
reliably deduced from the observation of specific interactions without further information (e.g. historical records
of co-existence in nature or congruent phylogenies of host
and parasite strains).
Whatever its origin, the finding of high specificity in the
interaction has further implications. The molecular basis
of highly specific resistance is currently unexplored in
invertebrate hosts. It could be due to the presence of different alleles of a certain cell surface protein targeted by
specific parasite effector molecules. Such cell surface proteins have been suggested to be important for the interaction between C. elegans and Bt toxin, the main virulence
factor of B. thuringiensis [24,25]. As a non-exclusive alternative, specificity may be a consequence of the inducible

immune system as recently suggested for the specific interactions between the copepod M. albidus and the cestode S.
solidus [14] or the waterflea D. magna and its microparasite P. ramosa [26]. The presence of an inducible system
was recently demonstrated for C. elegans in response to S.
marcescens [27], the fungus Drechmeria coniospora [28],
and also the Bt toxin of B. thuringiensis [29]. Considering
that diverse molecular tools are available for C. elegans,
this nematode may in the future provide a valuable model
system to dissect the molecular basis of specificity in
invertebrate-pathogen interactions.
Similarly, the observed highly specific virulence was previously unknown for S. marcescens. This bacterium is considered to be an opportunistic pathogen with a broad host
range [23]. Hence, it should mainly possess unspecific virulence factors, which are effective against a large number
of different taxa. Interestingly, some of the genes previously identified to contribute to pathogenesis in C. elegans
also mediate virulence in other hosts (Drosophila melanogaster; mice), whereas other genes do not [22]. This
already indicates some degree of specificity. Our results
may now provide the basis for a molecular genetic characterisation of virulence factors that vary in their specific
effects against different strains of a single host species.
This information may potentially be of great value for
understanding pathogenicity of S. marcescens in humans,
where this bacterium has become a growing health problem, primarily in nosocomial infections [30].

Conclusions
Based on the analysis of natural isolates of the nematode
C. elegans and its potential microparasite S. marcescens,
our study provides evidence for i) genetic variation in host
susceptibility and parasite virulence, and also ii) strainand genotype-specific interactions between the two. These
two factors represent an important precondition for frequency dependent selection and as such for the emergence of co-evolutionary arms races. Such highly specific
interactions were previously unknown for C. elegans or S.
marcescens. Moreover, they have not as yet been reported
for invertebrates other than molluscs and arthropods. At
least for C. elegans, the observed variation was found
among strains from the same population, such that it
could indeed be of relevance for evolutionary changes
under natural conditions. Taken together, these findings
suggest that there is widespread potential for co-evolutionary interactions in animal hosts. Both C. elegans and
S. marcescens represent important model organisms in
biological research for which a diversity of manipulative
techniques is available. Therefore, the association
between these two species may in the future provide a valuable tool for the comprehensive analysis of such highly
specific interactions.

Methods
We compared eight different natural C. elegans strains
with 5 different natural S. marcescens strains plus one control. The C. elegans strains were isolated by HS and coworkers in 2002 from Münster, North-West Germany
[18]. They are available from the Caenorhabditis Genetics
Centre under strain numbers MY6, MY8, MY10, MY14,
MY15, MY17, MY18, MY20 [31]. Some of these strains
bear different genotypes: strains MY6 and MY18 have genotype EU4; MY8, MY10 and MY20 genotype EU3; MY14
and MY15 genotype EU2; and MY17 genotype EU5 [18].
Maintenance of worms, including feeding, worm transfer,
synchronisation of cultures and cryo-preservation followed standard procedures [32]. These C. elegans strains
had all been cryo-preserved within 5 generations after isolation [18]. They were then thawed only few generations
before the start of the experiments to ascertain that they
were subjected to selection towards laboratory conditions
for the shortest possible time. One generation before the
start of the experiment, the worm cultures were always
synchronised using NaOH/NaOCl-treatment [32].
The S. marcescens strain Db11 was originally isolated by H.
Boman [33]; the strain Sm2170 was obtained from T.
Watanabe [34]; and strains ATCC274 [35], Sma3, Sma13
from G. Salmond (Cambridge, UK). These strains are
known to differ in pigmentation, which is thought to correlate with virulence: Db11, Sma3, and Sma13 have no
pigments, whereas ATCC274 and Sm2170 are pigmented
[22]. They were also already shown to differ in virulence
towards the main C. elegans strain N2 when tested on
solid agar, whereby virulence varied in the following order
(from high to low): Sm2170 > ATCC274 > Db11 > Sma3
= Sma13 [22]. Note, however, that the time-course of
infection in liquid medium is much more rapid than on
solid medium and that the underlying mechanisms of
pathogenesis in the two cases are not identical, at least for
Db11 (JJE and E. Pradel, unpublished observations). One
day before the start of the experiment, the bacteria were
grown in Luria Broth (LB) for about 18 h at 37°C. Their
OD was then adjusted to a value of 0.1 by addition of LB.
An OD 0.1 corresponds to a cell count of approximately 2
× 108 per ml. As a control, we used heat-killed bacteria of
strain Db11 (incubation at 70°C for 15 min). These dead
bacteria were previously shown to have lost their deleterious effects on C. elegans [22].
The interaction between C. elegans and S. marcescens was
assessed using a simple survival assay [20]. For this, individual worms were confronted with a defined concentration of the pathogens in NGM solution and their survival
checked after 24 h. The experiment was performed in 96well plates. Each plate always contained the five different
S. marcescens strains and the control, randomised across
the plate. Only one C. elegans strain was examined per

plate. Eight plates were analysed in parallel, each with one
of the eight different C. elegans strains. Five runs of this
set-up were performed, whereby the order in which strains
were analysed during each run was randomised. This setup resulted in a maximum of 80 data points per bacterial
strain – worm strain combination.
For a specific run, 50 µl NGM solution (without any bacteria) were first added to each well of the 96-well plates
using a multi-channel pipette. Thereafter, individual
worms were transferred to each well using the COPAS
automated worm-sorter (Union Biometrica Inc.). For
worm-sorting, we used synchronised L4 stage worms. Success of worm transfer was monitored. If no worm or more
than one worm was transferred to a particular well, then it
was excluded from further analysis. After worm transfer
was completed, 50 µl NGM solution with pathogens were
added to each well with a multi-channel pipette. These 50
µl contained 45 µl NGM solution and 5 µl of bacteria in
LB with an OD of 0.1, resulting in a total of approximately
1 × 107 bacterial cells per well at the start of the survival
assay. This concentration was found in a pilot study to
permit detection of differences in survival among worm
strains after 24 h. After this time period, the condition of
the worms was recorded using the following three categories: i) alive (clearly visible body movements; in some
cases only after being touched with a small pipette tip), ii)
morbid (touching them with a small pipette tip resulted
in retarded, very slow movements), iii) dead (no movements, even after being touched with a small pipette tip).
After completion of the experiment, we re-assessed the
interaction between two bacterial strains (Db11 and
ATCC274) and four worm strains (MY8, MY10, MY14,
MY15; the first two and the last two have identical microsatellite genotypes). The general set-up was the same as
above. In this case, a total of four 96-well plates were studied at the same time. In contrast to the above experiment,
each 96-well plate contained both the different worm and
bacterial strains, randomised across the plate. This set-up
results in a maximum of 48 data points per factor combination. In addition to the above, we included two 96-well
plates as a control. These contained heat-killed Db11 bacteria and the four worm strains randomised across plates
(48 data points per worm strain). After exposure to the
pathogens, we confirmed that worms were indeed
infected with the bacteria by analysis of some of the animals (N = 40) using differential interference contrast
microscopy and a fluorescent microscope (DMIRBE,
Leica).
The statistical analysis was performed with the program
JMP version 5.0 (SAS Institute Inc.). Based on the hierarchical order of the categorical response variable (0, dead;
1, morbid; 2, alive), we used an ordinal logistic regression

analysis (OLR) [36,37]. For the main experiment, we
included bacterial strain, worm strain, the interaction
between the two, and also run nested within both bacterial and worm strain as factors in the model. The whole
analysis was repeated using worm microsatellite genotypes instead of worm strain in the model. For the second
experiment, which was performed on a single occasion
instead of separate runs, a full factorial model was
employed, including bacterial strain, worm strain (alternatively, microsatellite genotype), and the interaction
between the two as factors.
For the main experiment, the lack of fit test was significant, indicating that the chosen model may not be sufficiently complex to explain the variation in the data (see
results section). Therefore, we additionally employed
association tests based on the inferred frequency counts
for the different factor combinations. We specifically
assessed the association between the treatment response
(condition of the worms) and either of the following factors: bacterial strain, worm strain, worm microsatellite
genotype, and run. The significance of the association was
inferred using the likelihood ratio test (LRT) [36,38]. We
further used the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test (CMH) to
assess the conditional independence between the treatment response and one of the above factors in consideration of a second factor from the above list [36]. The
response variable was treated as ordinal, while the predictors were treated as nominal (ordinal-nominal conditional association test) [36]. Multiple testing was
accounted for by adjusting the significance level using the
Dunn-Sidák procedure [38].
