Ancient DNA from lake sediments: Bridging the
gap between paleoecology and genetics

Abstract
Background: Quaternary plant ecology in much of the world has historically relied on morphological identification
of macro- and microfossils from sediments of small freshwater lakes. Here, we report new protocols that reliably
yield DNA sequence data from Holocene plant macrofossils and bulk lake sediment used to infer ecological
change. This will allow changes in census populations, estimated from fossils and associated sediment, to be
directly associated with population genetic changes.
Results: We successfully sequenced DNA from 64 samples (out of 126) comprised of bulk sediment and seeds, leaf
fragments, budscales, and samaras extracted from Holocene lake sediments in the western Great Lakes region of
North America. Overall, DNA yields were low. However, we were able to reliably amplify samples with as few as 10
copies of a short cpDNA fragment with little detectable PCR inhibition. Our success rate was highest for sediments
< 2000 years old, but we were able to successfully amplify DNA from samples up to 4600 years old. DNA
sequences matched the taxonomic identity of the macrofossil from which they were extracted 79% of the time.
Exceptions suggest that DNA molecules from surrounding nearby sediments may permeate or adhere to
macrofossils in sediments.
Conclusions: An ability to extract ancient DNA from Holocene sediments potentially allows exciting new insights
into the genetic consequences of long-term environmental change. The low DNA copy numbers we found in
fossil material and the discovery of multiple sequence variants from single macrofossil extractions highlight the
need for careful experimental and laboratory protocols. Further application of these protocols should lead to better
understanding of the ecological and evolutionary consequences of environmental change.

Background
Knowledge of the long term population history of a
plant species provides clues to its current distribution
[1-5], abundance [2,6] and genetic structure, [7-11], and
can also help assess its potential response to future
environmental change [12,13]. Ecological and biogeographic history have been inferred primarily from
paleoecological studies (fossil pollen and macrofossils in
sediments of lakes and peatlands, middens accumulated
by packrats and other rodents, tree-rings from living
and dead trees) and phylogeographic studies (spatial patterns of molecular and other genetic markers in living
populations). These records indicate that terrestrial

plant species have undergone population expansion,
contraction, isolation, fragmentation, and coalescence of
previously isolated populations since the last glacial
maximum [2-4,14,15].
Paleoecology and phylogeography each have unique
advantages and liabilities in historical inference. Pollen
assemblages incorporate pollen grains from a variety of
local and distant sources [16], and morphological similarities frequently prevent taxonomic resolution below the
genus or even family level [14]. Plant macrofossils offer
greater taxonomic and spatial precision [17], but sample
sizes may be small. Phylogeographic and population
genetic analyses often rely on broad assumptions to
infer population histories, but lack sufficient information
to connect genetic indices like effective population size
(Ne) to the census population size (N). Uniting the

disparate fields of genetics and paleoecology could compensate for their respective weaknesses [18,19].
Most studies linking plant paleoecological data to
measures of genetic change have relied on indirect links
between independent datasets [10,11,15,20-22]. Quite a
few studies take advantage of time series of genetic data
provided by ancient DNA (aDNA), usually without
explicitly linking them to changes in fossil data [23].
Studies directly linking ancient DNA (aDNA) to fossil
material [24-28] can explicitly characterize the genetic
consequences of observed fluctuations in census populations. Until now, these examples apply exclusively to
changes in animal populations. Progress for plant species has been limited by technical difficulties in extracting aDNA from the sort of fossils commonly used in
paleoecological studies, though recent advances in this
area show promise [29,30]. Here, we introduce a new
approach to aDNA extraction and sequencing: the
genetic analyses of lake sediments and associated
macrofossils.
The successful amplification of aDNA from a variety
of materials suggests that identifiable DNA may occur
in plant macrofossils and sediments from lakes. However, a wealth of experience from other studies, as well
as trial and error from our own work, indicate that the
search for aDNA must be approached with caution
[31-33]. In waterlogged environments, such as those
most common in Holocene fossil studies, hydrolysis of
DNA molecules presents a special challenge [30], but
there are notable successes in extracting plant DNA
from waterlogged material [34-36]. Generally, DNA
degradation, low DNA yields, and the risk of sample
contamination by modern DNA have led researchers to
develop strict protocols for aDNA extraction and amplification [32,33,37-39].
The purpose of our paper is to develop and evaluate a
reliable and repeatable protocol for aDNA extraction,
amplification, and sequencing from plant macrofossils
and bulk sediment from small lakes typically used in
paleoecological studies. We sampled macrofossils of four
tree species from sediments spanning the last 8000 years
from seven lakes with contrasting bathymetry and water
chemistry in the western Great Lakes region. We also
analyzed eight bulk-sediment samples from four of these
lakes. We address the following questions: Can aDNA
be reliably extracted from macrofossils and bulk sediments? Does preservation differ between sites, species,
or ages? How much DNA can be extracted from fossil
samples relative to the DNA yield in senescent plant tissue that initially falls into lakes? Do macrofossils contain
exogenous DNA? And, to what extent are detailed
aDNA protocols to prevent sample contamination
necessary?

Methods
Field and Laboratory Sampling

Our samples come from unconsolidated sediments of
seven small lakes in Upper Michigan and adjacent Wisconsin (Figure 1, Table 1). The upper 60-100 cm of
sediment from Canyon, Trout, and Ackerman Lakes
were obtained using a wedge- type freeze-corer [40,41].
Upper sediments (topmost 60-80 cm) from the other
sites, as well as deeper sediments from Trout and Ackerman Lakes, were obtained using a 7.5-cm diameter
modified Livingstone piston corer [42]. Cores were
extruded in the field, wrapped in plastic film, and transported to the paleoecological laboratory at University of
Wyoming where they were stored at 4°C. Since the
cores were collected independently of our studies of
aDNA, they were not coated with an exogenous DNA
tracer (as per reference [43]). This raises the possibility
of contamination by exogenous plant DNA during core
processing. We partially compensated for this risk by
sampling tissues and bulk sediment from interior portions of the core rather than from the core edge, where
exogenous DNA could most easily contaminate the sediments. Cores were sampled in increments 1 cm in thickness, representing time-intervals ranging from 5 to
20 years per sample. All of the cores were rich in
macrofossils, owing to small lake size and proximity of
coring sites to steep upland slopes [17]. Sampling of
materials for aDNA analysis was biased toward the last
3000 years, primarily because Jackson’s ongoing paleoecological studies in the region were concentrated on late
Holocene dynamics, so more material was available for
study. Most of our samples (106/126) came from Ackerman or Tower Lakes (Figure 1, Additional File 1), which
contained some of the richest and most diverse macrofossil records.
All macrofossil and bulk sediment samples were
extracted in the paleoecology laboratory at the University
of Wyoming. Bulk sediment samples (1 cm3) were taken
from the center of 1-cm slices of the sediment cores.
Sediment samples for macrofossil analysis (10-100 cm3)
were prepared by dispersal in distilled water, followed by
sieving (710 μm mesh) under a stream of tap water. Sieve
residues were rinsed and stored in distilled water and
scanned under a stereomicroscope for macrofossil sorting. Macrofossils and bulk-sediment samples were placed
in Falcon tubes after separation, and immediately frozen
(-20°C) or freeze-dried. All instruments (forceps, sieves,
vials, etc.) were sterilized between samples by flaming or
bleach treatment. All samples were shipped to the aDNA
laboratory at McMaster University in either a frozen or
freeze-dried state.
Macrofossil samples included red oak (Quercus rubra),
American beech (Fagus grandifolia), sugar maple (Acer

saccharum), and yellow birch (Betula allagheniensis).
Each species was typically represented by distinct tissue
types. For example, samaras and catkin-bracts were
most common for yellow birch, while beech was most
commonly represented by bud scales (see Additional
File 1). Macrofossil composition differed significantly
over time and space (Fisher’s exact test, p < 0.0001).
These differences partially result from changing species’
distributions over time (e.g., yellow birch and beech

immigrated relatively late to the study area, and beech
does not occur near our northeastern study sites).
Plant tissues reaching sediments range from living tissue to tissue that has persisted in aerobic conditions for
long periods before being washed into the lake. To
assess the yield (concentration) of aDNA extracted and
amplified from our samples relative to this spectrum of
tissues, we quantitated cpDNA in the type of senescent
material that might wash or fall into a lake, as well as

from analogous fresh tissues, using one 82-bp qPCRassay. This allowed us to determine whether most DNA
degradation/loss takes place after tissue senescence or
after deposition in the sediments. Our senescent material consists of tissues from 10 individuals from the
macrofossil reference collection at the University of
Wyoming, which were all collected from live trees in
the field, usually at the time of tissue senescence and/or
shedding of organs. These samples were of the same
organs as the plant macrofossils, and included seeds,
bracts, and/or bud scales from American beech, sugar
maple, and yellow birch. We did not have suitable reference samples of red oak, so we substituted bud scales
from black oak, Gambel oak, and white oak (Q. velutina,
Q. gambelii, Q. alba). Senescent tissues were original
collected up to several decades ago, so DNA yield in
these tissues reflects the original DNA content plus
degradation during storage. Analogous fresh material
was collected from trees on the University of Notre
Dame campus. In the absence of a separate study of the
DNA content of plant tissues arriving in sediments, we
assume these end members bracket the likely DNA content of the source material reaching sediments.
DNA extraction

DNA extraction protocols were the same for macrofossils, modern samples, and bulk sediments. All aDNA
analyses were conducted at McMaster University’s
ancient DNA facilities, while modern analyses were conducted at facilities at the University of Notre Dame.
Published aDNA protocols were used at McMaster
including the division of sample preparation, extraction
and PCR setup rooms; the use of protective clothing;
and techniques to minimize the contamination risk

including UV light exposure, bleach sterilization, use of
PCR workstations, and filtered pipette tips [32].
Within the designated preparation room, samples
were stored at -20°C until use. Immediately after
removal from -20°C, samples were submerged into
600 μl CTAB buffer (2% CTAB; 2% PVP; 1.4 M NaCl;
10 mM EDTA, pH 8.0; and 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0)
and chopped into very small pieces using sterile scalpels,
after which they were taken to the extraction room for a
2 hour incubation at 65°C. Subsequently 600 μl of Phenol/Chloroform/Isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) were added to
each tube and tubes were vortexed and centrifuged at
maximum speed (14,000 × g) for 5 minutes. The aqueous solution was transferred to another tube and
500 μl of CHCL3 was added. Samples were once again
vortexed and centrifuged at maximum speed for 5 minutes. The resulting aqueous phase was removed for concentration using microcon cartridges (50 bp cutoff YM10) (Millipore). Microcon membranes were first primed
with 100 μl of 0.1× TE (10 mM Tris-HCl, and 1 mM
EDTA, pH 8.0), after which samples were added and
centrifuged at maximum speed (14,000 × g) for 10 minutes. Microcon membranes were then washed by adding
300 μl of 0.1× TE, pH 8.0, shaking at room temperature
on an Eppendorf thermomixer at 650 rpm for 3 minutes
and centrifuging at maximum speed (14,000 × g) for
10 minutes. To elute the DNA we added 100 μl of 0.1×
TE pH 8.0 to the cartridges, which we then incubated at
room temperature on a thermomixer at 1000 rpm for
5 minutes. Cartridges were then inverted into a new
tube and centrifuged to acquire samples.
Negative and blank controls

We processed one negative extraction control for each six
fossil samples extracted (total of 28 blank extraction controls) and followed these samples through PCR amplification. Negative extraction controls followed the identical
procedure as aDNA extractions, minus the addition of fossil material. We ran 48 additional negative PCR controls,
where PCR reagents were mixed without template DNA
in the McMaster University cleanroom (prePCR) facilities,
and then transported to a separate facility for PCR amplification. We highlighted the effectiveness of our strict protocols against contamination by supplementing these
negative PCR controls with the type of negative controls
typically used in molecular laboratories focusing on modern tissue. In these “weak” negative PCR controls, we
added PCR reagents to sterile water in the same room in
which PCR products are analyzed.
In addition to PCR and extraction controls, we processed nine extraction blank controls to test directly for
modern DNA contamination along the DNA extraction
pipeline. Eight water samples were obtained from sieving and sorting sediment residues from Ackerman Lake
(4 samples) and Tower Lake (2 samples) and from tap

water in the University of Wyoming’s lab (2 samples).
We also processed one ambient air sample (obtained
from that lab) from a Falcon tube that was opened in
his lab to test for airborne DNA particles. DNA extractions of these samples were conducted using the same
extraction protocol as for aDNA samples. Positive
aDNA controls in this analysis consisted of three macrofossils (two oak leaf fragments and a leaf fragment of
yellow birch), which had amplified and quantified reliably in previous PCR reactions.
DNA amplification

For all species, we amplified and sequenced a single
82-bp section of the spacer region between the coding
genes atpB and rbcL in the chloroplast genome [44].
Sequence variation in this region within and between
species has been characterized by extensive sampling
throughout eastern North America (including the Upper
Midwest) in our focal species as well as in other common eastern trees [15] and McLachlan unpublished.
Polymorphisms in this fragment reliably distinguish

three taxonomic groups among the species we investigated: Fagaceae (beech and red oak), sugar maple, and
yellow birch, each distinguished by one 2 bp polymorphic site with three individual character-states for
each group (See Table 2). We also detected withingroup variation among Fagaceae through a transversion
mutation. PCR amplification reactions consisted of 1×
PCR buffer, 2.5 mM of MgCl2, 400 uM of dNTPs, 300
nM of each primer, 0.05 units of Taq Gold (Applied
Biosystems), 1 mg/ml of BSA, 30 mM of Rox Dye as a
reference dye, and 0.167 × of SybrGreen. Cycle conditions consisted of: 95°C-7 min initial denaturation, followed by 50 cycles of 95°C-30 sec, 56°C-30 sec, 72°C30 sec, and a final extension of 72°C for 15 min. Primers
used were Forward: 5’-ATTGGGTTGCGCCATACATA

could be influenced by several factors, including differential DNA survival over time or in different lakes, primer specificity, PCR inhibition, etc. We fit a binomial
generalized linear model (GLM) to amplification success
per sample with species identity, lake of origin, tissue
type, sample age, and number of PCR attempts as explanatory variables. To more flexibly estimate the relationship of amplification success to sample age, we fit a
binomial general additive linear model (GAM) to the
success data with age as a covariate. All statistical modeling was conducted using R (http://www.r-project.org).
DNA yield

We used qPCR reactions to test for primer sensitivity
and efficiency of the reaction by amplifying a dilution
series of known DNA copy numbers (31250, 6250, 1250,
250, 50 and 10 copies/5 μL). High R2 values (> 0.994) in
a regression of the number of DNA copies against PCR
cycle at a standardized threshold (Ct) provide evidence
that our reaction is efficient and, as the low end of the
standard amplifies well, that the reaction is also sensitive. Quantitative PCR is thus used to ensure that our
estimates of DNA quantity are reliable, even for smaller
DNA quantities. We then quantified DNA yields (in
copy numbers) of our ancient samples by comparing
amplification plots of the samples to those of the standard dilution series [45]. We used Fisher’s exact test to
assess the efficiency of our reactions at low copy number: we predicted that samples that amplified with low
DNA yield would also amplify in a second quantitation
attempt and that samples that had previously failed to
amplify would not amplify in this second attempt.
We tested whether DNA quantity (calculated as number of DNA copies 5 μl-1) was influenced by the same
variables we analyzed for PCR success (sample age, species, lake of origin, and number of attempted PCR reactions) using a GLM with lake and species as categorical
variables. We ran a separate GLM to find out whether
bulk sediments or macrofossils yielded higher DNA concentrations with sample age, lake of origin and number
of attempted PCR reactions as covariates. For all analyses of yield, DNA quantities were log transformed to
normalize the data (lnDNA).
The PCR reaction can be inhibited by the coeluates of
extraneous compounds (e.g., tannins) in the DNA
extracts as well as damage to the DNA molecule in the
form of covalently bound peptides or crosslinks [43].
Such inhibition can reduce estimates of total amplifiable
DNA. We tested for the presence of inhibition by incorporating a mammoth (Mammuthus) cytB DNA standard
into our qPCR analysis [24]. Mammoth DNA is unlikely
to have been present in any of our relatively young lake
sediment samples. By adding known quantities of a PCR
product derived from mammoth mtDNA into qPCRs

Page 6 of 15

containing our macrofossil and bulk sediment extracts,
any deviation from the expected mammoth values during qPCR amplification would indicate inhibition from
our aDNA extracts. We amplified 250 copies of a mammoth amplicon in the presence of 10 representative
extracts, as well as 1:10 dilutions of each extract. In the
absence of polymerase inhibition, these reactions should
amplify at the same Ct as the reaction with 250 copies
of mammoth DNA without added extracts. Polymerase
inhibition would be expected to increase the Ct of samples, and we expect that concentrated extracts would
amplify at higher Ct than the diluted extract from the
same sample in the presence of polymerase inhibition.
To illustrate the risk of contamination in more typical
laboratory settings, we supplemented the four true negative controls in this PCR run with an additional four
“weak negative controls” (see negative and blank controls). PCR amplification reactions consisted of 1× PCR
buffer, 2.5 mM of MgCl2, 400 uM of dNTPs, 300 nM of
each primer, 0.05 units of Taq Gold (Applied Biosystems), 0.75 mg ml -1 of BSA, 30 mM of Rox Dye as a
reference dye, and 0.167 × of SybrGreen. Cycle conditions consisted of: 95°C-7 min initial denaturation, followed by 45 cycles of 95°C-30 sec, 60°C-30 sec, 72°C90 sec, and a final extension of 72°C for 15 min.
Finally, we wanted to identify the point(s) along the
taphonomic process where DNA loss occurs. We did
this by looking at DNA yields between fossil, modern
senescent, and living material. Using the same protocols
described above, we extracted DNA and quantified
DNA yield from ten living and ten modern senescent
tissues. We used a t-test to compare ancient lnDNA
yields against modern senescent lnDNA yields.
Phylogeny

Following the cpDNA phylogeography literature (e.g.,
Petit et al 2003), we refer to each sequence variant as a
“haplotype”. We constructed a cladogram of aDNA haplotypes in our samples using TCS (version 1.21) [46].
TCS calculates a pairwise distance matrix between
sequence variants and calculates the probabilities for the
mutational steps detected using frequency data and parsimony criteria (as defined in [47]). Using a 95% cutoff,
a graphical output is generated representing the relationships between the haplotypes.
Multiple haplotypes from single samples

Multiple sequence variants derived from a single PCR
reaction could indicate DNA damage, or the different
sequences could be derived from multiple species or
mixtures of individuals of the same species with different haplotypes. DNA damage is difficult to ascertain
with certainty. Here, we consider polymorphic
sequences to be more likely the result of DNA damage

if they differ from sequences identified in living samples
by only one base-pair difference and if that difference is
a G to A or a C to T transition [48]. Because we don’t
know which of these transitions represent DNA damage
and which might be true polymorphic variation, we conducted analyses relevant to genetic composition and
relevant to the predominance of multiple sequences
twice: once including all sequence variation (assuming
no DNA damage) and once excluding sequences that
differ from known sequences by a single transition
(assuming that all these sequences indicate DNA
damage). Differences between the results of these paired
analyses indicate the extent to which DNA damage
might alter the interpretation of our results.
To detect multiple haplotypes within a single PCR
product, we cloned the products using a Topo TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) as per manufacturer’s instructions
and sequenced 4 clones on average. To ensure that the
consensus we derived for the remaining sequences were
authentic we directly sequenced representative PCR products multiple (at least two) times from two different
PCR reactions. We failed to produce a second PCR for
eight of the 66 samples which had previously amplified.
For these eight samples, we either only have one direct
sequence or clones from a single PCR reaction (see
Additional File 1). For cloning, bacterial colonies were
grown on LB-agar plates and then lysed using a boilprep protocol. Samples were then PCR amplified (1×
PCR buffer, 2.5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.2 μM PrimerF, 0.2 μM
PrimerR, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 1 U AmpliTaq Gold) under
the cycling conditions of 94°C-5 min, (94°C-30 sec,
57°C-30 sec, 72°C-30 sec) 29 times, and a final 72°C
extension for 15 minutes. In preparation for BigDye
cycle sequencing, all colony-PCR products were purified
using Millipore plates (YM-30), and all PCRs subjected
to direct sequencing were cleaned using ExoSap (USB
Scientific) according to manufacturer’s protocols. BigDye
cycle sequencing was conducted according to manufacturers protocols (Version 3.1), and reactions were run
on an ABI 3730 for data collection.
We often found more than one cpDNA sequence
among colony PCR products from the same reaction
and also among separate direct PCR reactions from the
same sample. We predicted that we would find multiple
haplotypes more commonly in bulk sediments than in
macrofossils. We conducted analyses first including all
sequences (assuming no DNA damage), and then
excluding sequences with polymorphisms associated
with DNA damage. We used Fisher’s exact test to determine if the probability of multiple haplotypes was
greater in extractions from bulk sediments. We also
tested this prediction with a logistic regression on the
probability of multiple haplotypes in one sample extract
with bulk sediment vs. macrofossil and the number of

Page 7 of 15

PCR attempts as explanatory variables. We also predicted that we would see a higher number of distinct
haplotypes in bulk sediments than in macrofossils. We
used a Poisson regression to test whether the number of
haplotypes differed between DNA extractions from bulk
sediments and macrofossils.
To the extent that we can distinguish taxonomic
groups using developed molecular markers, we
assessed whether the most common (‘dominant’) haplotype found in each individual macrofossil corresponded to that macrofossil’s morphologically based
taxonomic assignment. Our aim was to determine
whether the dominant haplotype was more likely to
represent endogenous DNA (i.e., from tissues of the
macrofossil) rather than exogenous DNA (from sediment adhering to the macrofossil or from sample contamination). This analysis requires that we assign each
sequence as correctly or incorrectly matching the
macrofossil species identity. Unknown sequences,
those that either did not correspond to any sequence
in our modern data set or had ambiguous base-pair
reads at sites that are polymorphic in modern samples,
were rare (34/298 sequences). To conservatively bias
our test, we coded these sequences as incorrectly
matching macrofossil ID. This classification only
altered the dominant haplotype code (to “incorrect”) in
one sample (of 57) and did not influence the significance of terms in our model. We modeled the probability that the dominant haplotype from each
macrofossil corresponded to the taxonomic identification of that tissue as a binomial response variable. Predictor variables included in a generalized linear
regression were number of sequences, number of
attempted PCR reactions, DNA quantity, and age of
samples. To assess the possible impact of DNA
damage on our results, we conducted this test first
using all sequences, and then repeated the test without
the suspect sequences (WOSS).
Changing genetic composition

As described above, species distributions and abundances have shifted over the last 5000 years at our study
sites. For instance, beech macrofossils appear in our
dataset only within the last 1500 years. We used pairwise Fisher’s exact tests to test if the genetic composition of the fossil material we studied also changed over
time. We divided our samples into three time periods
with roughly equal sample sizes (0 - 1200 yr BP; 1200 1700 yr BP; and > 1700 yr BP) and compared relative
haplotype frequencies between the oldest and youngest
periods. Again, we conducted this test first under the
assumption that no sequence variation was due to DNA
damage, then excluding samples with polymorphisms
suggestive of DNA damage (WOSS).

Results
Efficiency and reliability of our approach

not reveal DNA in the nine extraction blank controls of
ambient water and air samples from the macrofossil
extraction facilities at the University of Wyoming,
despite a sensitivity of 10 to 50 DNA copies (5 μl)-1. Of
28 negative extraction controls and 48 negative PCR
controls employed in the ancient DNA laboratory at
McMaster University, we found one contaminated
extraction negative control. The DNA sequence of this
contaminant matched the species of the sample that was
consistently placed next to it along the extraction process. (All samples are extracted in a particular order of
alternating species to track potential contamination). It
is likely that the single contamination event resulted
from pipetting error, rather than contaminants in the
laboratory environment. Of the four “weak” negative
PCR controls we used to illustrate the risk associated
with not separating low-template DNA preparation
from PCR processing facilities, one was contaminated
with approximately ten copies of DNA (Figure 2), illustrating the risks of weak controls when working with
low-copy DNA template.
PCR amplification success

PCR amplification success rate for samples less than
2000 years old was 64%, but the best fit of our binomial
general additive model (Figure 3) indicates a sharp
decline in successful amplification at this time. This
dropoff in amplification success might be confounded
by a coincidental decrease around this time in sampling
intensity and in the number of PCR reactions we

Numerous checks and controls illustrate the effectiveness of our protocols for extracting and amplifying
low-copy DNA while controlling for contamination by
exogenous DNA. The tight match between predicted
qPCR threshold cycle number and known DNA quantity
in our dilution series (R2 > 0.994) showed that the PCR
reaction was sensitive and efficient and that even low
numbers of DNA molecules could be amplified. In
repeated runs of this dilution series throughout the
experiment, however, the most dilute samples (10 copies
(5 μl)-1) occasionally failed to amplify, presumably due
to the stochasticity of PCR reactions with low template.
Thus, we were not always able to reliably detect the
lowest concentrations of DNA molecules.
We found no evidence of PCR inhibition in our
extracts. The amplification of known quantities of
spiked mammoth DNA were not inhibited by our DNA
extracts in twenty independent qPCR reactions
(Figure 2). This result imparts confidence in our ability
to detect and quantify the small amounts of DNA in
our ancient samples.
An array of 85 negative controls indicated that low
template samples are unlikely to result from contamination by ambient exogenous DNA. Quantitative PCR did

attempted for each extraction. This leaves open the possibility that older samples might have a relatively higher
PCR success rate with more effort. However, we
attempted to account for unequal sampling effort across
time and unequal number of PCR attempts per sample
by simulating samples of equal effort. In ten simulated
datasets, we randomly thinned the data to a uniform
sampling distribution across time and substituted a Bernoulli draw from the relative probability of success
(number of successful PCR reactions/number of PCR
attempts) for each individual’s success. The thinned data
are noisier, as we would expect, but confirm a drop in
amplification success around 2000 yr BP independent of
sampling effort (Figure 3).
We used a binomial generalized linear regression to
confirm that the probability of successful DNA amplification decreased significantly (p < 0.001) with age. However, the confounding decline in the number of
attempted PCR reactions was also significant (p <
0.001), which means that we are unable to discriminate
the effect of age on PCR success from that of sampling
effort in this analysis. We therefore accounted for
unequal sampling effort across time by simulating samples of equal effort. In ten simulations, where data were

Page 9 of 15

thinned to a constant sampling effort across time and
number of PCR attempts per sample, age significantly
affected amplification success (p < 0.001), confirming a
decline in PCR success in older samples. The binomial
GLM also tested whether PCR amplification success
could be explained by lake of origin, species, or whether
DNA extractions were from macrofossils or bulk sediments. We found that amplification success was independent of lake of origin. Within the limits imposed by
our sampling strategy, it appears that tissue type, species, and sedimentary environment do not strongly
influence our ability to detect DNA in samples less than
2000 years old.
DNA yield

Among the samples with successful DNA amplification,
DNA yield for the 82-bp cpDNA region was generally
low for both macrofossils and bulk sediments (Figure 4).
Our median DNA yield across all samples was < 10
copies (5 μl)-1, though aDNA yields also reached as high
as 76,060 copies of DNA (5 μl) -1 . We note that DNA
quantitation was a good predictor of sequencing reaction success, even for samples with low DNA yield.

Of samples that quantitated with <10 copies (5 μl)-1 in
a final quantitation assay of all our DNA extracts, 39/41
had previously produced unambiguous sequence data,
while samples that did not amplify in this reaction (68
samples) had usually failed to produce sequence data in
previous positive PCRs (though 8 had previously produced successful sequences). A Fisher’s exact test shows
highly significant association (p < 0.0001) between the
probability of a reaction failing or succeeding (despite
low DNA yield) in the final pPCR reaction given results
of previous reactions. This result supports our finding
(reported in Efficiency and reliability of our approach,
above) that even exceptionally low DNA concentrations
are reliably amplified with the protocols presented here.
A GLM showed that the quantity of DNA extracted
decreased significantly on a log scale with increasing age
(p < 0.01). lnDNA yield also varied significantly among
species (p < 0.01), with oak and yellow birch samples
having significantly more amplifiable DNA than other
sampled species. Increasing the number of PCR
attempts also resulted in significantly higher DNA yield.
In a second GLM, we found macrofossils had significantly more DNA than bulk sediments (p < 0.05).
DNA yields from ten samples of modern live material
analogous in weight and tissue type to our ancient samples were more than six orders of magnitude larger than
the highest yield from senescent or ancient material
(Figure 4). Plant tissue arriving in sediment, however,
originates from both living material and senescent material, including material that might persist in aerobic conditions for years before being washed into sediments.
We found the average DNA yield from senescent modern material was significantly greater than average
aDNA yield (t test: p = 0.04, 3.6031 ± 0.7747 SE, and
1.5115 ± 0.4195 SE, respectively), but the range of yields
overlap broadly, with DNA yields from senescent tissue
ranging from < 10 copies (5 μl) -1 to ~ 43,000 copies
(5 μl) -1 , and aDNA yields ranging from < 10 copies
(5 μl) -1 to ~ 76,000 copies (5 μl) -1 (Figure 4). Thus,
while we can say that over 99.9999% of living tissue
DNA is lost through taphonomic processes, we can not
say what proportion of this loss occurs within the aquatic environment.
DNA sequence data

We successfully sequenced ancient cpDNA across multiple species, lakes, and ages, for both macrofossils and
bulk sediment samples (see Additional File 1, or GenBank HQ333117 - HQ333132). Despite the small size of
our cpDNA fragment, we identified 16 haplotypes in
sediments, though only four of them matched sequences
from known taxa (Table 2, Figure 5). Of all samples that
amplified and were subsequently sequenced, 50% of the
sequences were consistent with Betula spp., 29% were

Page 10 of 15

consistent with Fagaceae, 0.003% were consistent with
Acer saccharum, 10% were of unknown origin, and 10%
had at least one ambiguous base. Seven of twelve
unknown haplotypes were differentiated from the haplotype of a known species by a single transition (G to A
or C to T), a pattern consistent with DNA damage (see
Table 2). These sequences make up less than ten percent (30/310) of all unambiguous sequences. We cannot
say with confidence whether these haplotypes represent
DNA damage, error in the PCR reaction, or real but
unidentified polymorphic variation in plants. We highlight the potential impact of DNA damage on relevant
analyses below by repeating statistical tests without suspect sequences (WOSS).
Multiple haplotypes were obtained from single extractions from both macrofossils and bulk lake sediments.
The frequency of multiple haplotypes in DNA extracts
from macrofossils (0.45) was not significantly lower than
the frequency of multiple haplotypes in bulk sediment
samples (0.57) (Test of equal proportions, p = 0.86).
When haplotypes suggestive of DNA damage are
removed (WOSS), the frequency of multiple haplotypes
decreases strongly in macrofossils (0.08), but it also
decreases in bulk sediments (0.33) and these frequencies
are not significantly different (p = 0.11). However, we
attempted more PCR reactions from macrofossils than
from bulk sediments. When we standardized for effort,
the probability of sequencing multiple haplotypes from a
single macrofossil was still not statistically distinguishable from the probability of sequencing multiple haplotypes from bulk sediments. When this analysis was
repeated after removing haplotypes suggestive of DNA
damage (WOSS), however, bulk sediments were shown
to be more likely to produce multiple haplotypes than
macrofossils (p < 0.05). This is the only case where
excluding haplotypes consistent with patterns of DNA
damage (WOSS) changed the significance of a statistical
analysis. Neither the number of sequences recovered
nor any of our usual explanatory variables (species, age,
lake of origin, number of PCR attempts, bulk/macrofossil) significantly explained the number of haplotypes
found in our samples in a Poisson regression (p > 0.05;
WOSS, p > 0.05).
In macrofossil samples with at least two sequences,
the dominant (most common) haplotype was consistent
80% of the time with the morphological identification of
the source macrofossil (45 out of 57 individuals; WOSS,
45 of 53; see Additional File 1). This suggests that endogenous DNA in macrofossil tissue is amplified more
often than ambient exogenous DNA either because it is
present in higher quantities or because it is better preserved. None of the variables we used to predict the
probability that the dominant haplotype correctly
matched the macrofossil’s taxonomic ID (tissue type,

sample age, DNA yield, number of attempted PCR reactions, or the number of sequences examined) were
significant in our binomial regression. The same nonsignificant results were found using WOSS data.
In summary, finding multiple haplotypes in DNA
extractions from macrofossils and finding evidence of
DNA damage both present technical challenges in our
results, but most sequences in our dataset did not have
these problems. Of the 57 macrofossils with unambiguous sequences, 40 (74%) had only one haplotype. Of
these single haplotype samples, 35 (88%) had haplotypes matching the species ID of the macrofossil in
question and the remainder had haplotypes matching
other species. Of the 14 macrofossils with multiple
haplotypes, 9 (64%) contained a mixture of the “correct” sequence and sequences that differed from this
“correct” sequence by a single transition. Such samples
appear to contain DNA from a single individual that
has received a degree of DNA damage over the years.
Of the remaining multi-sequence macrofossils, four
had a mixture of “correct” sequences and sequences of
other species and one had a mixture of sequences
from other species. Additional File 1 classifies macrofossils according to these categories of damage and
multiple haplotypes per sample.

Changes in genetic composition over time

We found a significant difference between the genetic
composition of young (<1200 yr BP) and old (>1700 yr
BP) material (Fisher’s exact test using all sequences, p =
0.01; WOSS, p = 0.02); (Figure 6). Younger sediments
contained a higher proportion of Fagaceae haplotypes,
consistent with the abundant beech budscales found
only in younger sediments. This genetic change over
time is potentially confounded by the inclusion of locations with only older sequences (Trout Lake) or only
younger sequences (Canyon Lake, Hell’s Kitchen Lake).
We reran the analysis using only samples from the two
sites that had relatively abundant sampling in both periods, Ackerman Lake and Tower Lake, which are located
100 km apart in the eastern Upper Peninsula of Michigan (Figure 1). There is no significant difference
between the genetic composition of material in these
two locations when samples are pooled across all time
periods (p = 0.61; WOSS p = 0.45), but younger sediments pooled across the two sites contained material
with a different genetic composition from older material
(p = 0.02; WOSS p = 0.01). We found no significant differences between the genetic composition of old and
young sediments of individual lakes or in pairwise comparisons between individual lakes, but sample sizes for

Anderson-Carpenter et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:30
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/30

these tests were small, so tests are unlikely to identify
significant differences.

Discussion and Conclusions
A recent review [49] argued that opportunities for aDNA
recovery from sediments in temperate climates are likely
to be worse than those in permafrost environments.
Indeed, ancient plant DNA as old as 300,000 to 400,000
years old has been recovered from permafrost [43]. However, DNA preservation, degradation and leaching in permafrost settings are likely to be very different from that in
lacustrine sedimentary environments and we want to be
careful about apples to oranges comparisons. Successful
amplification of plant DNA in temperate anaerobic sediments has, until now, been difficult. Holocene aDNA
sequences have been recovered from macrofossils [50] and
from individual pollen grains [51] in anaerobic peats and
lake sediments, but success rates were very low (<10%) in
these studies, even for recently deposited material. In our
study, success rates are higher than previous analyses and
inhibition is lower. On the other hand, the concentration
of DNA extracted in our work is often extremely low,
highlighting the importance of careful protocols against
contamination. Comparisons in results between existing
studies are ultimately somewhat weak, however, because
each study sampled different tissues from different
environments.
Application of aDNA data to the same plant tissues
from the same depositional assemblages used in most
temeprate paleoecological work has potential for greatly
advancing and amplifying understanding of the ecological, evolutionary, and biogeographical consequences of
the dramatic environmental changes of the recent past
[18,19,29] further informing assessments of risks and
appropriate actions in the face of rapid environmental
change [11,52,53]. Our study constitutes a critical first
step towards the goal of aDNA application to terrestrial
plant paleoecology and biogeography. We document
that small amounts of cytoplasmic DNA of multiple species can be extracted and amplified from materials,
including a variety of plant macrofossils, preserved in
Holocene lake sediments. The vast majority of DNA
from living plant tissue appears to be lost before it
reaches lake sediments and there is a further slower
decline in DNA yield after sediment burial. Under
rigorous protocols and safeguards, aDNA from lake
sediments can be reliably extracted, amplified, and
sequenced with a low threat of contamination by modern DNA. Despite the DNA depletion in sedimentary
material, quantitative PCR allowed us to confidently
produce sequence data after millennia of its burial in
sediments.
Successful extraction and amplification from sedimentary materials younger than 2000 yr BP indicates that

Page 12 of 15

further applications to the late Holocene should be
straightforward under our protocols. The steep decline
in success beyond 2000 yr BP remains enigmatic, and
deserves additional study. Age-dependent aDNA degradation processes may be responsible, but there is no
obvious mechanism for rapid loss at the 2000-year
threshold. A regional environmental signal is suggested
by the simultaneous decline in PCR success across lakes.
Paleohydrological and paleoecological studies in the
region indicate that effective moisture increased substantially during the late Holocene (between 4000 and
2000 yr BP) [54-56]. Water-levels in all of our study
lakes were probably substantially shallower before at
least 3000 yr BP, and hence the sediment surface when
early to mid-Holocene macrofossils were deposited was
better-ventilated and perhaps more conducive to rapid
DNA degradation. This hypothesis can be assessed with
more-intensive sampling of older sediments, particularly
comparing lakes and coring sites of differing water
depths.
DNA extractions from most bulk-sediment samples
and from some individual macrofossils contained
mixed sequences representing multiple individuals
and/or DNA damage. The occurrence of aDNA from
multiple individuals is unsurprising for bulk sediments,
which integrate diverse material from multiple sources
(pollen, plant tissues, organic flocculents). Ancient
DNA from multiple sources in individual plant macrofossils, particularly representing taxa other than that of
the macrofossil itself, may derive from small sediment
particles clinging to the macrofossil surface or trapped
in small cracks. These sources are difficult to exclude
in sample preparation; the rough microtopography of
many macrofossil surfaces, as well as the frequent
occurrence of tears or fissures, provide opportunity for
materials from the surrounding sediment matrix to
attach or infiltrate. Complete removal of these by
either chemical or mechanical treatment before DNA
extraction may be difficult without risking damage to
the tissues and the aDNA contained within. We are
now experimenting with alternative treatments to
minimize extraneous aDNA from sediment matrix
while also minimizing damage to the material and
aDNA of interest.
Most phylogenetic and population genetic analyses,
including those used in other aDNA studies [25], assume
that the number of sampled individuals is known. Single
macrofossils containing multiple haplotypes can hamper
such applications. The aDNA sequences endogenous to
individual macrofossils might be probabilistically distinguished from exogenous sequences; endogenous DNA
dominated the mixture of sequences in most macrofossils. Additional evidence based on mechanism of DNA
damage can be used to statistically identify sequence

periods.

variation caused by DNA damage [57]. Distinguishing
between the genetic identity of individual macrofossils,
DNA damage, and the genetic composition of the sediment matrix, even in a probabilistic sense, would allow
us to apply standard population genetic analyses to
macrofossils (e.g., Beast, Serial SimCoal).
Applications of aDNA to macrofossils and other
materials from lake sediments will require careful consideration of taphonomic issues, including the sources
of the aDNA. Plant macrofossils in sediments of small
lakes generally represent trees growing within 100-101
meters of the lake margin [17,58]. Such spatial precision has considerable advantages in application, but it
also ensures that only a small number of individual
trees are likely to be represented in a macrofossil
assemblage. DNA studies of surface sediments, linked
with genetic census of trees near the lake margin, can
help assess these and other issues of sampling and
representation. DNA from pollen, whether analyzed
from individual pollen grains [51] or integrated into
bulk-sediment samples, represents a broader range of
sources. Pollen assemblages in lake sediments comprise
a distance-weighted integration of surrounding vegetation; although local individuals will be better represented than those farther away, a substantial amount
of the pollen deposited in small lakes derives from
plants growing 102 -105 m from the lake margin [16].

Bulk sediments may contain plant aDNA from a variety of sources, including pollen and plant tissues.
Comparison of DNA signatures from bulk surface sediments with genetic data from multiple spatial scales
may help identify the potential sources. Genetic signals
at different spatial scales, for example, might be
extracted using a combination of macrofossils and pollen grains as aDNA sources.
The degree of temporal integration or smoothing in
aDNA signatures is also of concern. Our lake-sediment
samples each represented narrow intervals of deposition
(5-20 years), although deposition rates can be far slower
in many lake settings [59]. Once entombed, individual
plant macrofossils and smaller particles, including pollen
grains, are unlikely to move vertically. Although vertical
migration or leaching of DNA has been observed in
sediments of caves, [60], we view this as highly unlikely
in lake sediments. Periodic downward percolation of
water can evidently move DNA in porous, granular sediments of caves and perhaps soil profiles. Lake sediments, in contrast, are permanently saturated and
gravitational percolation of water does not occur. Once
sediments are compacted, vertical advection of pore
water is minimal, and multivalent metals and organic
compounds (pigments, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
(PAHs), organic molecules with more than 15 carbon
atoms) are immobilized in the sediment matrix. Large

Anderson-Carpenter et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:30

organic molecules such as DNA are likely to adhere to
solid-phase sediments (particles, particulate organic matter). Industrially derived organic molecules (PAHs,
PCBs) show marked patterns of increase in lake sediments at locally appropriate time-horizons, with no evidence of vertical leaching [61,62].
Despite the important work left to be done, our study
clearly shows significant changes in the genetic composition of plant communities in Holocene lake sediments
(Figure 6). Indeed, the significant increase in Fagaceae
sequences in recent sediments matches the increased
representation of Fagaceous macrofossils in those sediments [56].
