Abstract
Background: Leptospirosis is a world-widely distributed zoonosis. Humans become infected via exposure to pathogenic
Leptospira spp. from contaminated water or soil. The availability of genomic sequences of Leptospira interrogans serovar Lai and
serovar Copenhageni opened up opportunities to identify genetic diversity among different pathogenic strains of L. interrogans
representing various kinds of serotypes (serogroups and serovars).
Results: Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis was used to compare the gene content of L. interrogans serovar
Lai strain Lai with that of other 10 L. interrogans strains prevailed in China and one identified from Brazil using a microarray
spotted with 3,528 protein coding sequences (CDSs) of strain Lai. The cutoff ratio of sample/reference (S/R) hybridization for
detecting the absence of genes from one tested strain was set by comparing the ratio of S/R hybridization and the in silico
sequence similarities of strain Lai and serovar Copenhageni strain Fiocruz L1-130. Among the 11 strains tested, 275 CDSs were
found absent from at least one strain. The common backbone of the L. interrogans genome was estimated to contain about 2,917
CDSs. The genes encoding fundamental cellular functions such as translation, energy production and conversion were
conserved. While strain-specific genes include those that encode proteins related to either cell surface structures or
carbohydrate transport and metabolism. We also found two genomic islands (GIs) in strain Lai containing genes divergently
absent in other strains. Because genes encoding proteins with potential pathogenic functions are located within GIs, these
elements might contribute to the variations in disease manifestation. Differences in genes involved in O-antigen biosynthesis
were also identified for strains belonging to different serogroups, which offers an opportunity for future development of genomic
typing tools for serological classification.
Conclusion: CGH analyses for pathogenic leptospiral strains prevailed in China against the L. interrogans serovar Lai strain Lai
CDS-spotted microarrays revealed 2,917 common backbone CDSs and strain specific genes encoding proteins mainly related
to cell surface structures and carbohydrated transport/metabolism. Of the 275 CDSs considered absent from at least one of
the L. interrogans strains tested, most of them were clustered in the rfb gene cluster and two putative genomic islands (GI A and
B) in strain Lai. The strain-specific genes detected via this work will provide a knowledge base for further investigating the
pathogenesis of L interrogans and/or for the development of effective vaccines and/or diagnostic tools.

Background
The genus Leptospira comprises a heterogeneous group of
saprophytic and pathogenic species belonging to the
order Spirochaetales [1]. Pathogenic Leptospira spp., including L. interrogans, L. kirschneri, L. noguchii, L. borgpetersenii,
L. santarosai, L. weilii, and etc. [2], are etiological agents of
leptospirosis. They are excreted in urine of the infected
animals and may penetrate the human body through skin
or mucous membranes when the host contacts with contaminated water or soil [3]. Because of the wide spectrum
of animal species that serve as reservoirs, leptospirosis is
considered the most widely spread zoonotic disease [1].
The genus Leptospira, including pathogenic and saprophytic species, can be further classified into serological
types, i.e., serogroups and serovars, defined by a crossagglutination absorption test. The alternative genotypic
classification is based on DNA hybridization and thus, the
leptospires can be assigned to the species level [4-6]. However, these two classification systems are not always consistent. Strains belonging to the same serovar may belong
to different Leptospira species and vice versa [2,6].
L. interrogans serovar Lai is a virulent serovar of serogroup
Icterohaemorrhagiae, which is more likely to cause severe
leptospirosis than the other serovars prevailing in China
[7]. Following the determination of the complete
genomic sequence of the L. interrogans serovar Lai strain
Lai (#56601) in 2003 [8], the genome of another L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni strain Fiocruz L1-130 of the
same serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae was sequenced and
released [9,10]. Genomic comparison of strain Lai with
strain Fiocruz L1-130 revealed extensive variation in the
number and distribution of insertion sequences and other
genomic contents [10], which should eventually determine the unique phenotypes of each strain.
Although whole-genome sequencing is a powerful
method of genetics and genomics, it is still laborious and
expensive. Recently, comparative genomic hybridization
(CGH) has been used to facilitate the comparison of unsequenced bacterial genomes in order to monitor the gene
contents of closely related bacterial species [11-15]. Based
on the genomic sequence of L. interrogans serovar Lai
strain Lai, we constructed a microarray to compare the
genomes of a number of L. interrogans serovars in order to
clarify their genetic relationship and identify features that
may serve as molecular markers to profile the serovars or
genospeices, which may correspond to different levels of
disease manifestation. Eleven L. interrogans strains that are
endemic in China were analyzed. Sequences absent in L.
interrogans were mostly confined to regions in the rfb gene
cluster and two genomic islands (GIs) of strain Lai. The
results are discussed in the context of the possible role of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/204

these regions in L. interrogans with respect to serovar determination and virulence.

Results and discussion
CGH microarray analysis and in silico genomic
comparison of L. interrogans serovar Lai vs L.
interrogans serovar Copenhageni
The genomes of two L. interrogans strains, Lai and Fiocruz
L1-130 belonging to the same serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae, were completely sequenced in China and Brazil
respectively [8,9]. The genomic contents of these two
strains were compared by CGH employing a strain Lai
sequence based whole genome CDS microarray (Methods). The genomic sequences of the two strains were also
compared in silico. CDSs of strain Lai absent in Fiocruz L1130 were predicted by a BLASTN search, and the degree of
similarity between the matching tested genomic sequence
and the probe itself in terms of the length of match and
the percentage sequence identity at the DNA level was
expressed as H values (see Methods).

For CGH analysis with DNA microarray slides, it is important to set an appropriate threshold to detect CDSs missing from the sample strains. In this study, we compared
the H values to the results of CGH between strain Lai and
Fiocruz L1-130 expressed by the normalized signal ratio
of sample strain/reference strain hybridization (S/R ratio
or ratio, hereafter, Fig. 1). It is clear that the plot of H values of each CDS versus its corresponding log2 S/R ratio
values was divided into two groups defined by the apparent cutoff values of H and the log2 ratio. We may define
the cutoff H value as 0.2 because any CDS is either absent
or significantly divergent in strain Fiocruz L1-130 from
that of strain Lai, when H ≤ 0.2 (total 59 CDSs, among
them, 37 with H = 0, i.e., total deletion). For the same
token, if the H value of a CDS is larger than 0.2, it can be
considered a conserved gene. We may also draw the cutoff
S/R ratio for hybridization as 0.33 (log2 ratio = -1.585)
because this value divides the CDSs into two categories
almost identical to that of H = 0.2, except two data points
(two dot arrowed in Fig. 1), which is the minimum
among all the other possible cutoff values (Table 2). In
other words, although, for unknown reasons, there were
genes with unexpected signal ratios in groups IV and VI,
the numbers of such genes were relatively low (1 of 89
genes and 1 of 313 genes) and with this cutoff, we may
have the minimal 3.3% false positives (2/61) and zero
false negatives (0/3131) among all the other choices (refer
to Table 2).
An S/R ratio of -1 on the log2 scale was frequently used in
previous studies [11,15]. However, for this study, with the
threshold value of -1, four conserved genes with H value
more than 0.9 would be designated as absent in strain
Fiocruz L1-130. Therefore, a threshold log2 ratio value of -

Sixteen of the 275 absent CDSs were chosen for confirmation tests with PCR amplification in 12 L. interrogans
strains. Only 4 reaction results did not match the CGH
results among the 192 PCR reactions. Moreover, we also
validated the CGH results by comparing them to the publicly available sequence variation data of the rfb loci from
five serovars of L. interrogans (Canicola, Pyrogenes,
Autumnalis, Australis and Pomona) [16] employing the
BLASTN in silico hybridization method. The two results
were well matched and in conclusion, our CGH results are
reliable and reasonable.
The distribution of the absent genes indicated that majority of the absent/divergent genes were clustered in three
regions (Fig. 2). The rfb gene cluster (from LA1576 to
LA1672) was previously described [8]. The other two
regions were referred as GI A (from LA0702 to LA0717)
and GI B (from LA1747 to LA1851) respectively. The rest
absent genes were scattered over the genome.

1.585 (S/R ratio = 0.33) determined by the statistical correlation between the S/R ratio and the genomic sequence
similarity (H value) of L. interrogans strain Lai and strain
Fiocruz L1-130 is more appropriate than the artificial
value of -1 for detecting the absent/divergent CDSs for the
L. interrogans strain Lai whole genome CDS microarray-based
CGH studies.
Overview of the microarray analysis
The genomic contents of the 11 L. interrogans strains were
analyzed by CGH using the CDSs encoded by the genome
of strain Lai as reference. The results are shown in Fig. 2
and Additional file 1. Of the 3,528 CDSs spotted on the
microarray slides, 275 were considered absent from at
least one of the L. interrogans strains tested. These CDSs
accounted for 5.8% of all the CDSs of strain Lai annotated
[8] or 7.9% of the CDSs spotted on the slides. With invalid
data excluded (Methods), the remaining 2,917 CDSs were
likely conserved in all the strains used in this study. There
were differences in the numbers of absent CDSs for different strains, ranging from 61 in strain Fiocruz L1-130 to
161 in strain P7 (Table 1).

The proportions of the absent CDSs with respect to their
functional category are shown in Table 3. Genes encoding
fundamental cellular functions were relatively conserved
(absent genes only counted less than 5% of the corresponding categories), such as translation (2.82%), energy
production and conversion (1.31%, the lowest rate of
gene absent for all categories), as well as transport and
metabolism for lipid and inorganic ions (both less than
2%). In contrast, genes in 5 functional categories including cell cycle control and defense mechanisms have over
10% of the CDSs absent. Approximately 16.53% of the
genes assigned to cell wall biogenesis including sugar biosynthetic enzymes and outer membrane efflux proteins
were absent from most of the L. interrogans strains analyzed. Approximately 13.19% of the genes assigned to carbohydrate transport and metabolism and 14.52% of
those assigned to secondary metabolites biosynthesis,
transport and catabolism were also missing. One must
clarify that genes of the last category mainly encode methyltransferases, which are likely involved in sugar modification. Thus, it is not surprising that most of the absent
genes in these three categories (82% absent genes of cell
wall biogenesis, 95% absent genes of carbohydrate transport and metabolism and 78% absent genes of secondary
metabolite biosynthesis, transport and catabolism) were
located in the O-antigen (rfb) locus.
Structure and function of the genomic islands
Three bacteriophages of the saprophytic L. biflexa were
first isolated by Saint Girons et al. [17]. These bacteriophages do not infect representative species of pathogenic
leptospires. However, evidence for horizontal transfer of
DNA among L. interrogans (sensu lato) came from studies
of the intervening sequences found within the 23S rRNA
gene [18] and from the finding that the leptospiral

* Among the total of 3528 CDSs array, there were 336 invalid data for low quality signal of hybridyzation derived from all of the CGH experiments.
That makes the total 3192 CDSs listed in the table.

lipopolysaccharide biosynthetic locus (rfb) is located in a
genomic island that was probably acquired through horizontal transfer from gram-negative source(s) [19,20].
Three regions with large sets of missing CDSs detected by
CGH in the 11 L. interrogans strains presented some characteristics of laterally transferred genomic elements.
Besides the rfb gene cluster, the GC content, genome signature, as well as the codon and amino acid usage bias of
the other two missing regions were analyzed along with
the chromosomal DNA sequence of strain Lai (Fig. 3) [21]
to verify their GI characteristics.
The first putative genomic island (GI A) is a ~28-kb-long
segment of DNA encompassing CDSs from LA0702 to
LA0717. It begins with an insertion sequence ISlin1 and a
transposase (LA0702) [9], and ends with an IS3 and a
transposase gene (LA0717) [9]. This region presents many
characteristics expected for a typical GI [21-23]: (1) higher
GC content, (2) altered codon preference, (3) different
amino acid usage pattern, and (4) genes encoding transposases at the ends (CDSs LA0702 and LA0717).
Among the 16 CDSs included in this region, there are 8
CDSs without any significant homology to genes in the
GenBank database. Besides the 2 proximal genes both
encoding transposases, there are 4 other genes encoding a
transposase, an integrase, a molybdate metabolism regulator and a lipoprotein, respectively.
There are two genes likely related to pathogenesis. LA0705
was found to contain an LRR (Leucine-rich repeats),
which is characteristic for a diverse array of proteins providing a versatile framework for protein-protein interaction [24]. It is particularly interesting to notice that, all of
the bacterial LRR proteins that have been well character-

ized so far, including those from Listeria monocytogenes
[25], Streptococcus [26], Yersinia pestis [27], Salmonella typhimurium [28] and Shigella flexneri [29], are implicated in
virulence. It was shown to be a major virulence factor in L.
monocytogenes presumably functioning as triggering
engulfment of the bacterium after specifically interacting
with cell-surface receptors [25]. On the basis of their
sequence similarity, the probable pathogenic function of
this gene in L. interrogans serovar Lai is worth to be further
explored.
Another CDS, LA0706, shares amino acid homology with
hemin receptor of gram-negative bacteria involved in the
acquisition of iron from hemin and hemoglobin, such as
the ChuA of Escherichia coli O157:H7 [30], HemR of Yersinia enterocolitica [31], ShuA of Shigella dysenteriae [32],
and HgpB of H. influenzae [33]. Its contribution to bacterial virulence was proven in uropathogenic E. coli[34] and
the heme scavenging function of the hemin receptor
ChuA is speculated to depend on the activity of α-hemolysin, which gains access to the intracellular heme reservoir [35]. Since 9 hemolysins were confirmed in strain Lai
[36,37], one may speculate that the coupling of hemolysis
with heme utilization could serve as an effective iron
acquisition strategy during the progression of strain Lai
infection.
The second large GI (GI B) spans almost 83 kb, from
LA1747 to LA1851. It is not inserted at the 3' end of a
tRNA gene and it bears no significant variations in its GC
content. However, it does have all the expected properties
of a typical GI in other aspects. It begins with an insertion
element IS1501 and a transposase [9], and ends with a
transposase. This island also has large numbers of CDSs
encoding proteins with unknown functions, but several of
others are homologous to the bacteriophage-encoded

proteins (LA1833, LA1835 and LA1836) and integrases
(LA1768 and LA1811). This indicates that phage-mediated integration events may be involved in the acquisition
of this island.
Of the 45 CDSs in the GI B region spotted on the microarray, majority of them were missing from the strains
tested (Fig. 2). The pattern of the absent genes seemed
highly mosaic. Further concerning the very low level of
variation in its GC content and the presence of multiple
transposases, it may suggest that the GI B region is likely a
site experienced extensive insertion, excision and recombination and it could be acquired from species with G+C
content similar to that of L. interrogans or that the base
composition of the acquired DNA have gradually adapted
to the host genome.
It is particularly interesting that Fiocruz L1-130 lacks the
whole GI B segment except 11 genes located at the two
ends of this region. This missing region covers a 54-kb
DNA segment specific to strain Lai (from LA1768 to
LA1847) [10]. Recently, Bourhy and his colleagues named
this 54-kb DNA region LaiGI I and demonstrated it can be
excised from the chromosome to form a replicative plasmid [38]. They also observed imprecise excision of LaiGI
I in L. interrogans serovar Lai. This finding may further support the mosaic character of the GI B region detected in
different strains of L. interrogans, which is larger than and
covers the whole segment of LaiGI I.
The GI B also contains genes encoding putative regulators.
For example, the AraC family transcriptional regulator
gene (LA1770) has been shown to regulate diverse bacterial functions including sugar catabolism, response to
stress and virulence [39-43].
Horizontal gene transfer plays an important role in the
evolution of different bacterial pathotypes [22]. The two
putative GIs found in strain Lai contained many divergent

genes with several features of pathogenicity and metabolic
islands. Because these GIs are largely missing in other
pathogenic L. interrogans spp., they may not encode genes
essential for pathogenesis but might contribute, to certain
extent, the severe pathogenic properties of serovar Lai
infection [7].
Structure and function of the rfb gene cluster
Leptospiral LPS plays critical roles in both pathology and
immunity during the course of leptospirosis and forms
the basis for serological classification of Leptospira spp.
[1,44-46]. The O-antigens are synthesized by a set of
enzymes encoded by the rfb gene cluster in addition to a
few genes scattered over the whole chromosome [8]. The
nucleotide sequence of the strain Lai rfb locus spanning
LA1576- LA1672 comprises 103 kb [8]. CGH analysis
revealed that although the rfb gene cluster is frequently
absent from all strains tested except Fiocruz L1-130, its 3'proximal end is conserved, which spans from LA1658
through to LA1672. In contrast, the genetic layout at the
5'-proximal end is more variable. Because the genes
located in this segment of strain Lai (and Fiocruz L1-130)
were predicted to encode glycosyltransferases and
enzymes catalyzing sugar activation, the genetic variations
of this segment is likely to cause the variations in LPS
composition/structure of the tested strains. These results
confirmed previous reports that the genetic basis for serological differences among leptospiral SVs were related to
the presence of specific sugar-biosynthetic or -modifying
genes in their respective rfb loci [16,46].

In addition, comparison of the rfb loci of strains Lai and
Fiocruz L1-130, both belong to the same serogroup, Icterohaemorrhagiae, revealed only minor gene diversity.
Hierarchical clustering of the CGH data based on the 89
rfb genes further revealed the phylogenetic relationship
among different strains (Fig. 4). The unrooted (uneducated) tree revealed that strains Lai and Fiocruz L1-130
were clustered together but showed relatively low correla-

L183 and H18 (both belong to the same serogroup,
Sejroe) were also clustered together. This result implies
that the compositions of the rfb locus genes from strains
of the same serogroup are likely more similar to each
other than those of different serogroups. Although strains
belonging to different serogroups were also found to fall
under the same node, such as strains 4 and Lin, and strains
Lin4, Lin6 and Luo; no strains belonging to the same serogroup were separated into two or more different nodes.
Due to the lack of comprehensive sequence information
for the rfb loci of all the strains tested, this result may lie
in incapable of identifying rfb genes present in the tested
strain but absent from the strain Lai-based microarray.

countries to prevent leptospirosis [47,48]. However various kinds of serovar specificity limited the efficacy of protection against different pathogenic leptospires [49,50]. A
major focus of research for the prevention of leptospirosis
is to identify proteins conserved among pathogenic leptospires, which may generate cross-protection against
strains of various serovars [51-55]. In addition to the complete genomic sequence information for pathogenic bacteria, CGH analysis was useful as one of the approaches
based on reverse vaccinology [56] for screening vaccine
candidates against leptospirosis.

Because of the key role of leptospiral LPS in pathology,
immunity and taxonomy, the continued investigation of
LPS biosynthetic genes in other serovars, particularly the
strain-specific and/or missing regionsof the rfb loci is
important. Conserved sequences flanking missing CDSs
identified by the CGH analysis for different serovar strains
might serve as appropriate primer candidates for amplifying strain-specific regions, which could eventually be useful for rapid identification and isolation of characteristic
genomic segments (genes or gene clusters) corresponding
to leptospiral serogroups and serovars.

Genes that are highly conserved over a broad range of
strains could be useful for the development of a proteinbased vaccine capable of protecting hosts against most of
the pathogenic serogroups of L. interrogans in China. Our
results showed that 24 putative lipoprotein or outer membrane proteins were not conserved among the strains
tested [see Additional file 2]. However, previous report
indicated that OmpL1 and LipL32 were highly conserved
among the main endemic strains of L. interrogans in China
[57]. This CGH analysis not only confirmed these results
but further identified additional conserved leptospiral
protein antigen candidates, such as LipL41 and immunoglobulin-like proteins, and they have been shown to
elicit protective immunity in animal models [58-60].

to hemorrhage and localized ischemia in multiple organs
[6]. Potential virulence factors such as hemolysin, protease and ankyrin-like proteins are suggested for pathogenesis of leptospirosis [10]. The CGH results showed that
most of the potential virulence factors were conserved
among all strains. The L. interrogans strain Lai microarray
included the 7 genes coding for hemolysins [36,37], of
which, 5 (LA0327, LA0378, LA1650, LA3050 and
LA3937) were conserved among all strains tested. Two
hemolysin genes (LA1027 and LA1029) were absent from
strain 65-9. Ankyrin repeats were found in numerous proteins mediating specific protein-protein interactions [61].
Genes encoding ankyrin-like proteins were found in bacterial genomes located in close proximity to genes encoding proteins involved in either nutrient acquisition and
uptake or tolerance/resistance to antibiotics, starvation or
oxidative stress [62,63]. The microarray used for this CGH
analysis included the 11 ankyrin-like protein encoding
genes. These genes were conserved in all strains except
LA2263, which was absent from strain 65-9. The gene
encoding collagenase was also conserved in all strains
tested.

Conclusion
L. interrogans serovar Lai strain Lai whole genome CDSs
microarray based CGH analysis revealed extensive similarities in gene content among L interrogans strains of different serovars endemic in China. We discovered that
2,917 of the 3,528 CDSs represented on the microarray

were present/conserved in any of the 11 given L interrogans
strains. Only 275 CDSs were absent when compared to L
interrogans strain Lai. Most of these strain specific genes
are focused on 3 genomic island-like loci. Of which, two
GIs (GI A and GI B) had several features as pathogenicity
and metabolic islands. Both of them contain many divergent genes, which may contribute to differences in disease
manifestation. Differences in the genes involved in Oantigen synthesis largely focused on the third genomic
island-like rfb locus were also identified in strains belonging to different serogroups, which will open new avenues
for the development of rapid typing tools by analyzing
serovar-specific genes. Although strain-specific genes may
result from genetic drift, some of them are likely to encode
proteins adapted to genetically diverged hosts or factors
contributed to different disease outcomes. Given the
small sample size and lack of clinical information for
many of the strains, we cannot correlate these specific
genes with particular disease outcomes. However, The
strain-specific genes presented by this work will form the
basis for further investigation of the pathogenesis of L
interrogans and will be useful for data-mining aiming at
future development of effective vaccines or diagnostic
means.

hageni, one of the prevalent serovars in Brazil. L. interrogans serovar Lai strain Lai was encoded #56601 by
National Institute for the Control of Pharmaceutical and
Biological Products (NICPBP) of China and was maintained by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) with other prevalent pathogenic
leptospiral strains in China, isolated from human or
horse. The genomic DNA of strain Fiocruz L1-130 was
kindly provided by the Centro de Pesquisas Goncalo
Moniz. Strains were grown in liquid Ellinghausen-McCullough-Johnson-Harris (EMJH) medium [64] at 28°C
under aerobic conditions and collected at a density of
about 108 bacteria per ml. Bacterial genomic DNA was
purified using a Bacteria Genomic DNA kit (Huashun
Co.) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Construction of L. interrogans CDS microarray
Annotation of the L. interrogans serovar Lai strain Lai
genome identified 4727 CDSs (accession number GB:
AE010300 for CI and GB: AE010301 for CII). Among
them, very short CDSs (less than 250 bp) and CDSs highly
homologous to each other at the nucleotide levels were all
excluded and a total of 3,528 annotated CDSs were
selected for microarray fabrication. PCR primers were
designed using Primer3. All primers were synthesized by
Dgbio Co. L. interrogans serovar Lai strain Lai genomic
DNA was used as the template for PCR amplification. The
thermal cycle parameters were 30 sec denaturation at
94°C, 45 sec annealing at 55°C and 1.5 min elongation at
72°C for 35 cycles. Amplified products were checked on
agarose gels to verify their size and quantity, and were
scored as successful if a single product of the expected
mobility was detected. Amplified products were ranged
from 250 to 1200 bp. The final array consisted of 3528
CDSs (74.6% of annotated CDSs). The PCR products were
then purified using 96-well Multiscreen PCR plates (Millipore) following the user manual instructions. The purified DNAs were air-dried at 65°C, and were re-suspended
in 30 μl of 50% DMSO. Final concentration of the spotting sample is 250 ng/μl.

Cluster analysis of L. interrogans serovar Lai rfb genes.
The subset of 89 rfb genes in microarray was used to generate a dendrogram of strains based on the presence or
absence of the genes. The strains were grouped by average
hierarchical clustering using the CLUSTER program and the
output displayed using the TREEVIEV program. Shown at the
top is the unrooted tree for the relationship of the serovars.
Red and black areas denote the presence and absence of
genes respectively.

Microarray printing and processing
The PCR products (250 ng/μl) were spotted in triplicate
on to glass slides (FullMoon Biosystem) coated with polylysine, following the standard protocol developed by P.
Brown, Stanford, CA [65]. The DNA of the human β-actin
gene and 50% DMSO were included in the microarray
design as internal control elements. The spotter and software used were from GeneMachines (Omnigrid and Gridder 2.0).
Microarray, labeling and hybridization
The genomic DNA of L. interrogans serovar Lai strain Lai
was used as reference DNA in a double-fluorescence
hybridization. Genomic DNAs from the reference strain

Lai and other test strains were sonicated to fragments,
ranging from 250 bp to 2000 bp in lengths. These DNA
fragments were used as templates for the direct incorporation of fluorescent nucleotide analogs (Cy3- and Cy5dCTP respectively) (Amersham Biosciences Co.) by a randomly-primed polymerization reaction. In brief, 3 μg of
genomic DNA was labeled with 6 μg of random nonamers
(Takara), 25 U of the Klenow fragment (New BioLab) and
1 nmol of Cy3- or Cy5-dCTP at 37°C for 3 h. Probes were
purified by a QIAquick Nucleotide Removal Kit according
to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). Purified
DNA probes were dried and finally resuspended in 8 μl of
sterilized distilled water. The labeled DNA sample was
combined with 20 μl formamide, 7.5 μl 20 × SSC, 0.3 μl
10% SDS, 1 μl 10 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA (Life Technologies), denatured for 3 min at 99°C, and applied to
the microarray slide, which was then covered with a 24 ×
50 mm glass coverslip. The labeled DNA was hybridized
to the DNA microarray in a hybridization chamber at
42°C for 16 h. When the hybridization was complete, the
slides were washed at 55°C with 1 × SSC containing 0.2%
SDS for 10 min and then at 55°C with 0.1 × SSC containing 0.2% SDS for 20 min, and finally at room temperature
with 0.1 × SSC for 3 min. The last step was conducted
twice. The slides were immediately dried and scanned for
fluorescence intensity using a GenePix 4000B microarray
scanner (Axon Instruments), and the results were
recorded in 16-bit multi-image TIFF files. Competitive
hybridization was conducted twice for each strain. In the
first experiment, the strain Lai reference DNA and the
sample DNA were labeled with Cy3 and Cy5, respectively.
In the second hybridization, the dyes for labeling were
interchanged.
Data analysis
The signal intensity of each spot in the microarray was
quantified using GenePix Pro 4.0 (Axon Instruments)
software. Additional data analyses were conducted by the
computer software programs Microsoft Excel and GeneSpring 5.0.2 (Silicon Genetics). The data were filtered so
that spots with the reference (strain Lai) signal lower than
background plus 2 standard deviations of background
were discarded. Signal intensities were corrected by subtracting the local background. Sample/reference (S/R)
ratios of signal intensity were calculated and were transformed to logarithm base 2. The ratios were normalized
by taking the median log2 ratios of all spots as 0. To determine the final value for each CDS tested, the median value
was calculated from three log2 ratios obtained from 1
DNA microarray slide. In addition, to ensure only high
quality data were used for analysis, spots that gave invalid
results in one strain tested were considered as invalid
results in other tests and thus, discarded. This allowed for
the retrieval of 3,192 spots. CDSs were considered absent/
divergent if the final ratios of signal intensities were both

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/204

less than -1.585 on the log2 scale in two dye-interchange
experiments.
Genomic comparison of the L. interrogans serovar Lai
and L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni strains in silico
Each nucleotide sequence of the CDSs assigned in the
genome of strain L. interrogans serovar Lai (accession
number GB: AE010300 for CI and GB: AE010301 for CII)
was used as a query for a homology search with BLASTN
against the genome sequence of the L. interrogans serovar
Copenhageni (accession number AE016823, AE016824).
The region with the highest score for each query was
retrieved and classified by the H value. This homology
score was proposed by Fukiya et al. [66] and reflects the
degree of similarity between the matching test genome
sequence and the probe itself in terms of the length of
match and the percentage sequence identity at the DNA
level. For each query, the H value was calculated as follows: [(length of highest-score region) × (identities of hit
shown in BLASTN)]/(length of query sequence). If there
was no sequence with a BLASTN E value less than 0.01,
the query CDS was judged to be absent from the L. interrogans serovarCopenhageni genome, and its H value was
0. Queries for genes that were probably absent gave low H
values. Therefore, H belonged to the set [0, 1]. The H value
indicated how closely the corresponding sequence of L.
interrogans serovar Copenhageni resembled the L. interrogans serovar Lai query CDS in terms of length and
sequence identity.
PCR validation
Sixteen genes were randomly chosen from strain-specific
genes to verify the CGH results. Primer sequences are in
Additional file 3. For each gene, PCR was performed in 12
L. interrogans strains. The parameters for amplification
were as follows: 95°C for 3 min; 30 cycles of 94°C for 30
sec, 55°C for 30 sec, and 72°C for 1 min; and a final
extension cycle of 72°C for 5 min. PCR products were run
on agarose gels to confirm the presence of a band of the
expected size.
