Abstract
Background: Histone acetyltransferase enzymes (HATs) are implicated in regulation of transcription. HATs from
different families may overlap in target and substrate specificity.
Results: We isolated the elp3+ gene encoding the histone acetyltransferase subunit of the Elongator complex in
fission yeast and characterized the phenotype of an Δelp3 mutant. We examined genetic interactions between
Δelp3 and two other HAT mutants, Δmst2 and Δgcn5 and used whole genome microarray analysis to analyze their
effects on gene expression.
Conclusions: Comparison of phenotypes and expression profiles in single, double and triple mutants indicate that
these HAT enzymes have overlapping functions. Consistent with this, overlapping specificity in histone H3
acetylation is observed. However, there is no evidence for overlap with another HAT enzyme, encoded by the
essential mst1+ gene.

Background
Chromatin is modulated in part by the pattern of different histone modifications, leading to the speculation
that a “histone code” provides epigenetic information
that facilitates chromosome activities [1,2]. Not surprisingly, the enzymes that modify chromatin have diverse
roles in the cell that affect multiple DNA-dependent
events. Acetylation was the first histone modification
identified, and is associated with a variety of chromatin
functions [2,3]. While some evidence suggests that acetylation changes association of DNA with the underlying
nucleosomes [4], it also creates specific binding sites for
proteins involved in a variety of DNA transactions [2,3].
Acetylation has long been linked to transcriptional activation, so that the histone acetyltransferase enzymes
function generally as transcriptional activators [5].
Histone acetyltransferases are well conserved in eukaryotes and can be separated into multiple gene families
based on primary sequence. The MYST family of

histone acetyltransferases was named for founding members identified in yeast and humans, MOZ, YBF2/SAS3,
SAS2 and TIP60 [6]. Most species contain multiple
members of this family. The Kat5 group, the most conserved family members, includes SpMst1 (S. pombe),
ScEsa1 (S. cerevisiae) and hTip60 (human), which acetylates residues in the tails of histones H2A and H4 [7].
These proteins are the catalytic HATs for the NuA4
complex in their respective organisms [8,9]. In the
yeasts the Kat5 orthologues are the only MYST family
HATs that are essential for viability [10,11].
In budding yeast there are two other MYST family
members, ScSas2 and ScSas3, which were originally isolated with defects in silencing the mating locus [12,13].
ScSas2 is the catalytic HAT for the budding yeast SAS
complex that acetylates H4K16 [14]. It antagonizes the
histone deacetylase Sir2 [15]. ScSas3 is the catalytic
HAT for the NuA3 complex in budding yeast [16]
which specifically acetylates histone H3 [17]. In S.
pombe by contrast there is only one additional MYST
family member, SpMst2 [11]. Mst2 shows sequence
similarity to both ScSas2 and ScSas3. However, its biological function, in which it antagonizes SpSir2 in

telomere silencing, suggests that it is a functional homologue of ScSas2 [11].
Another conserved family of HATs is the Gcn5related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) super-family consisting of Gcn5, Elp3, Hat1 and Hpa2, with Gcn5
(KAT2) and Elp3 (KAT9) as the most studied members
[18]. The evolutionarily conserved Gcn5 is the catalytic
subunit of several multi-subunit complexes including
the SAGA co-activator complex [19]. Gcn5 acetylates
multiple lysine residues of histones H3 and H2B and
mediates both targeted and non-targeted (global) acetylation [20]. In S. cerevisiae, SAGA is recruited to promoter regions by transcription factors like ScGal4 and
ScGcn4. Elongating RNA Pol II is associated with the
Elongator complex that contains ScElp3 and has been
shown to acetylate H3K14 and H4K8 in budding yeast
[21]. Elp3 is highly conserved in structure and function
between human and budding yeast [22].
While neither ScGCN5 nor ScELP3 is essential in
budding yeast, a double mutation in Δgcn5 Δelp3 double mutant is significantly sicker than either single
mutant [23], resulting in hypoacetylation of histone H3
in gene coding regions [24] and spreading of ScSir3
into sub-telomeric DNA [25]. Data from budding yeast
suggest that ScGcn5 also overlaps with ScSas3, because
a double deletion Δgcn5 Δsas3 is lethal [26]. This suggests that there are shared functions or targets of the
NuA3, SAGA, and Elongator complexes in budding
yeast, which implies that different HAT families may
perform the same modifications. However, because the
complement of HATs is somewhat different in S.
pombe, it is not clear how general this overlap may be.
SpGcn5 has been previously characterized for its
effects on gene expression [27,28] and for chromatin
binding genome-wide [29]. Surprisingly, relatively little
change in gene expression profile is observed in gcn5
mutants despite a very high association with the chromatin. This suggests that SpGcn5 overlaps with other
HATs.
Here, we examine evidence for redundancy between
HAT enzymes in S. pombe. We report the initial characterization of fission yeast elp3+ and examine phenotypes associated with single, double, and triple
mutations of Δmst2, Δgcn5 and Δelp3. We show that
these enzymes affect expression of overlapping but
nonidentical sets of genes, suggesting overlapping contributions to gene expression. Consistent with this, we
observe biochemical evidence that these proteins share
common histone substrates. We also observe that
these phenotypes are distinct from the gene expression
effects of a temperature sensitive allele of mst1, and
suggest that multiple histone targets regulate gene activation in fission yeast.

Results
Characterization of Δelp3 and interaction with other
HAT mutants.
In order to compare the roles of different histone
acetyltransferases on transcription in fission yeast, we
first characterized the disruption of the histone acetyltransferase gene elp3 + , the likely orthologue of the
ScELP3 subunit of Elongator complex [21]. We found
that S. pombe elp3+ is a non-essential gene, as is its budding yeast orthologue [30]. However, Δelp3 mutant cells
have elongated morphology compared to wild type, indicative of cell cycle delay (Fig. 1A). The mean length of
mononucleate cells is 6.7 μm in wild type, and 10.7 μm
in Δelp3. For binucleate cells, wild type averages 9.8 μm
compared to 15.9 μm in Δelp3. Thus Δelp3 is approximately 60% larger than wild type. Also as in budding
yeast [30], fission yeast Δelp3 grows slowly due to a prolonged lag phase (Fig. 1B). Although the growth rate of
Δelp3 cells once they have reached exponential phase is
similar to wild type, they appear to enter stationary
phase at a lower cell density. Given the presumed role
of Elp3 as part of the Elongator complex, we presume
that this reflects defects in one or more growth-associated transcription program.
We examined other phenotypes associated with Δelp3,
and compared them to phenotypes associated with
mutations in other non-essential histone acetyltransferases, Δmst2 and Δgcn5. We observed that Δelp3 has
poor growth overall compared to either Δgcn5 or Δmst2
(Fig. 1C). Both Δgcn5 and Δelp3 showed slight temperature sensitivity. As reported previously [28], Δgcn5 is
sensitive to salts (KCl or CaCl 2 ), but we observed no
overlap in this phenotype with Δmst2 or Δelp3. We also
assayed the sensitivities of these HAT mutants to different DNA damaging agents (Fig. 1D), since histone acetylation is necessary for proper repair from DNA damage
[31]. The Δmst2 mutants are sensitive to hydroxyurea,
which depletes nucleotides and results in replication
fork stalling, and to high doses of the DNA alkylating
agent MMS, which causes DNA damage [11]. We
observed that Δgcn5 and Δmst2 show similar sensitivity
to hydroxyurea. Consistent with our previous results,
Δmst2 is modestly sensitive to low levels of MMS, but
we observed no sensitivity in Δgcn5 or Δelp3. We also
observed no sensitivity to the topoisomerase inhibitor
camptothecin (which causes S phase specific DNA
breaks) or UV irradiation. Δmst2 is also sensitive to the
microtubule poison thiabendazole (TBZ), a phenotype
typical of mutations that affect centromere function or
chromosome segregation.
We next constructed double and triple mutants to see
whether there was evidence for epistasis or synthetic
growth defects under these conditions. All combinations

were viable, although the triple mutant Δgcn5 Δelp3
Δmst2 was very slow-growing. The slow-growth phenotype of the triple mutant strain made it difficult to distinguish pathway specific effects from general sickness
in this strain.
Previously, we assigned Mst2 as the likely ScSas2
orthologue, based on the similarity of their phenotypes,
although it is also phylogenetically related to ScSas3. In
budding yeast Δsas3 Δgcn5 is lethal [26], but in fission
yeast Δmst2 Δgcn5 is viable. We assayed growth at 30°
and 36°C for the single and double mutants. At 30°C,
there was little effect observed. At 36°C, the Δgcn5
Δmst2 mutant displays a temperature sensitivity resembling Δgcn5, indicating that there is no overlap between
Gcn5 and Mst2 with regards to heat stress. The Δgcn5
Δelp3 mutant, however, shows increased temperature

sensitivity compared to the single mutant strains. The
Δmst2 Δelp3 mutant displayed a phenotype intermediate
between the parents, suggesting that the faster growth
associated with Δmst2 in relation to wild type is also
able to overcome the slow growth associated with Δelp3
(Fig. 1C).
We examined the salt sensitivity of the double
mutants, because Δgcn5 has been associated with this
phenotype [28]. The Δgcn5 Δmst2 double mutant is
hypersensitive to salt compared to Δgcn5 alone (Fig.
1C), suggesting that for this function, these two HATs
overlap. In contrast, the Δgcn5 Δelp3 double mutant has
a phenotype similar to Δgcn5 alone suggesting that Elp3
does not contribute to proper salt stress response.
Since Δmst2 has been linked to damage sensitivity, we
also examined the response to different DNA damaging

Nugent et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:59
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/59

agents (Fig. 1D). Δmst2 Δgcn5 cells also showed
increased sensitivity to MMS and CPT treatment relative to the two single mutants, suggesting that these two
HAT enzymes make redundant contributions to replication-specific DNA damage. Interestingly, Δelp3 modestly
suppressed the sensitivity of Δmst2 to HU (Fig. 1D). All
the double mutants showed some sensitivity to TBZ;
however, Δgcn5 Δelp3 was more sensitive than the parent strains.
Genome wide expression studies

Previous studies showed while Gcn5 is bound to a high
proportion of genes in S. pombe growing on rich media,
it is requested for the expression of only a few of its
binding targets [27,28]. This together with the synthetic
and additive phenotypes observed here with the different
mutant combinations suggests that HAT enzymes
redundantly affect common pathways at the level of
transcriptional regulation. However, it is also formally
possible that they independently affect regulation of
separate pathways that overlap downstream at the level
of cellular function. To distinguish between these possibilities, we performed genome-wide analysis of expression using microarray technology to identify target
genes that show HAT-specific changes in gene expression. We examined the effects on transcription upon
deletion of the GNAT family HATs Gcn5 and Elp3 and
the MYST HAT Mst2 both singly and in combination.
We chose a very statistically rigorous cutoff of 3.25 log2
fold change for genes that we considered differentially
expressed. This allowed us to be extremely confident
that all results were biologically relevant and eliminated
most false positives.
We found that there were very few genes whose
expression was significantly changed by 3.25 log2 fold
or more during asynchronous growth compared to wildtype cells in Δmst2, Δgcn5 or Δelp3 cells (Table 1). Of
the small number of genes with increased expression,
the RecQ-type DNA helicase SPBCPT2R1.08c, located
in the sub-telomere domain (tlh2+; [32,33]) was the only
significantly up-regulated gene in all three mutant
strains. Consistent with previously published data we
found that there was an enrichment of genes involved in
mating and meiosis in Δgcn5 cells (Additional File 1).
Interestingly, of the few genes with decreased expression
in Δgcn5 and Δmst2, most are found within 150 kb of
the ends of chromosome I or II, suggesting that cells
require Gcn5 and Mst2 for expression of genes localized
near the sub-telomeric region (Fig. 2D).
The few genes that were differentially expressed in
Δelp3 and Δgcn5 showed significant over-representation
in several functional ontology groups. In agreement with
prior reports [27] we observed that Δgcn5 mutants derepressed mating and meiosis genes. Specifically we
found that gene ontology (GO) terms [34] related to

Page 4 of 16

mating and meiosis were found in the up-regulated
genes, indicating that Gcn5 is required for repression of
these genes. In Δelp3 mutants we found that genes significantly enriched in GO classes associated with transmembrane transport were down-regulated and those
associated with ion transport were up-regulated (Fig 2,
Additional File 1). Interestingly, mei2, which has been
shown to be repressed by Gcn5 [27] was down-regulated
in Δelp3 (Fig. 3). This may indicate that Gcn5 and Elp3
target the same pathway but with opposite effects. The
few genes that were differentially expressed in Δmst2
mutants provided no over-represented GO classes.
Global gene expression changes in double mutants

We next asked whether the transcription profiles of the
double mutants were simply additive to the single
mutants, or whether they affected new genes not in
common to the single mutant strains. We assayed
changes in gene expression in the double mutants. The
number of differentially expressed genes in the double
and triple mutants was significantly increased compared
to the respective single mutants for each strain tested
(Fig. 2, Additional File 1, Additional File 2), suggesting
overlapping regulation rather than an additive effect.
Only the helicase tlh2+ and a metabolic kinase, dak1+
were significantly up-regulated in all mutant combinations. The double mutants Δgcn5 Δelp3 and Δmst2
Δelp3 had the most overlapping up-regulated genes (Fig.
2, Additional File 3). These genes included metal transporters and the sporulation specific gene spo6 + . We
found that Δgcn5 Δmst2 cells had a greater number of
up-regulated genes related to the mating pathway than
Δgcn5 alone, suggesting that Gcn5 and Mst2 are functionally redundant in repressing sexual differentiation.
This is also observed, although to a lesser extent, with
the Δgcn5 Δelp3 mutant. However changes associated
with Δmst2 Δelp3 were not significantly enriched in
gene classes associated with mating or meiosis, except
for spo6+, which is essential for progression of meiosis II
and sporulation. When we examined down-regulated
genes in the double mutants, we again found the most
overlap between Δgcn5 Δelp3 and Δmst2 Δelp3 cells,
however there were more differentially expressed genes
in Δgcn5 Δmst2. A large fraction of these genes were
found to be sub-telomeric (Fig. 2D) which suggests that
Mst2 and Gcn5 but not Elp3 function preferentially in
the sub-telomeric regions. This is consistent with previous studies suggesting that Mst2 works at the telomere
[11].
Functional redundancies between HATs

To determine whether the mutations affected distinct
functional groups, we categorized the affected gene targets by gene ontology (GO) classification. As was apparent for the individual genes, the genes affected by the
double mutants were more significantly enriched in a

larger number of GO classes than for the single
mutants. For GO classes enriched in down-regulated
genes there were 23 terms for Δgcn5 Δelp3, 22 for
Δgcn5 Δmst2, while Δmst2 Δelp3 had 10 enriched GO
terms (Fig 2, Additional File 1). Curiously there is
almost no overlap in enriched GO terms associated with
genes down-regulated between double mutants, with the
exception of cellular response to stress and response to
stimulus shared between mst2 Δelp3 and Δgcn5 Δelp3.
Therefore we conclude that Gcn5, Mst2 and Elp3 are
functionally redundant in activating transcription. For
GO categories enriched with up-regulated genes there
were 7 categories for Δgcn5 Δelp3, 36 for Δgcn5 Δmst2,
and Δmst2 Δelp3 had 3 enriched GO terms (Fig. 2).
There are no overlapping enriched up-regulated GO
categories between double mutants. When we examined
the number of genes and the GO terms they represent
in the double mutants compared to the single mutants,

we conclude that Gcn5, Mst2 and Elp3 are functionally
redundant in repressing transcription because the number of terms enriched in the double mutants cannot be
explained by adding the single mutants’ terms together.
There were more significantly enriched genes in the
double mutants than in the single mutants.
Validation of microarray results

We used quantitative PCR (qPCR) to confirm the
microarray results. The ddCt method [35] was applied
to measure relative fold differences between each strain
and one wild type sample with act1+ used as the loading
control. For each strain, we chose genes that were predicted by the microarray to have significant changes in
transcription. The fold changes of the other two wild
type samples relative to the first wild type sample was
small (2-fold at the most) across all the loci. The fold
changes of the other two control genes relative to act1+
were also small (2-fold at the most) across all the

strains. We found high degrees of congruence in gene
expression as measured by RT-PCR and microarray analysis. (Fig 3).
Salt response in Δmst2 and Δgcn5 mutants

Since Δmst2 and Δgcn5 showed a synthetic phenotype
in salt sensitivity, we performed expression profiling on
Δmst2 and Δgcn5Δmst2 double mutant under KCl treatment and compared this to our previous results on
Δgcn5 using the same platform [28]. The number of
affected genes in Δmst2 increases during KCl induced
stress but fewer genes are affected in Δmst2 compared
to Δgcn5, consistent with the observation that Δmst2
alone has little effect on salt response. To find genes
that require Gcn5 or Mst2 during KCl stress we compared the expression levels between Δgcn5 and Δgcn5
Δmst2.
We found 99 genes that were significantly down-regulated and 191 genes significantly up-regulated in the
double mutant, compared to Δgcn5 single mutant
(Additional File 4). About 80% of these genes were not
significantly regulated in either of the single mutants
(Fig 4). This suggests that the two HAT enzymes overlap in the regulation of salt-responsive pathways,
although there was no significant overlap in particular

Gcn5/SAGA is a known regulator of H3 acetylation, as
is Elp3/Elongator [21,36]. The phenotypes associated
with Δmst2 suggest it is the functional orthologue of
ScSas2, but if this is the case, there is no obvious NuA3/
Sas3 homologue in S. pombe to overlap with Gcn5 activity, as Sas3 does in S. cerevisiae. Because more genes
showed changes in expression in the double mutants
than would be expected by a simple sum of those
affected in the single mutants, we examined levels of

Page 8 of 16

histone H3 acetylation in the mutant strains to see
whether there is evidence for overlapping specificity at
the level of global histone acetylation.
As expected, we found H3 acetylation levels on H3K9,
K14 and K18 were dramatically reduced in the Δgcn5
mutant (Fig 5). In Δelp3 and Δmst2 as well as in the
Δmst2 Δelp3 double mutant there is only a modest
decrease in H3K9 acetylation levels compared to wild
type. In contrast, all strains lacking gcn5 show significant
loss of H3K9ac (Fig. 5A), suggesting that Gcn5 is the
major contributor to H3K9 acetylation. Similar results
were observed for H3K18ac.
For H3K14 acetylation we found significant reductions
of acetylation levels for each single mutant compared to
wild-type cells. Strikingly, in the double mutant Δgcn5
Δmst2, the signal is much more strongly reduced (Fig.
5B). None of the deletion mutants showed any significant reduction in the overall level of histone H3 (Fig.
5D). Therefore we conclude that Gcn5 (GNAT family)
and Mst2 (MYST family) each contribute to acetylate
H3K14, which has been shown to be important for the
response to salt stress [37]. Defective acetylation of
H3K14 could explain the hypersensitivity to salt stress
observed in the Δgcn5 Δmst2 mutant.
Genes differentially expressed by the essential HAT Mst1

Finally, we examined the essential MYST family HAT
Mst1 using the temperature sensitive allele mst1ts[38].
The mst1 mutant was grown at the semi-permissive
temperature 30°C overnight and RNA was isolated for
microarray analysis. There were many more differentially expressed genes in the mst1 mutant compared to
any of the non-essential HATs studied here (Table 2).
There were also many more up-regulated than downregulated genes in the mst1 mutant, suggesting that it
functions in repression of gene expression. Consistent

Figure 5 Histone H3 acetylation is differentially affected by different HAT mutants. Levels were determined by Western blots of whole cell
lysates from the indicated strains with antibodies specific to H3K9ac, H3K14ac, H3K18ac, compared to levels of actin and total histone H3 (Cterm). Strain list: wild-type (FY368), Δgcn5 (Hu799), Δelp3(FY3851), Δmst2 (FY1890), Δgcn5 Δmst2(Hu990), Δgcn5 Δelp3 (FY3847), Δmst2 Δelp3
(FY3850), Δgcn5 Δelp3 Δmst2 (3854)

with this there were no GO categories that were significantly enriched in the down-regulated genes, however
there were many that were enriched in the up-regulated
genes (Additional File 1). These GO groups include
metal and salt transporters, and other metabolic processes. When we compared these GO categories with
those observed for the other mutants, we found that
there was some overlap with the double mutant Δgcn5
Δmst2 and the triple mutant Δgcn5 Δelp3 Δmst2, suggesting general stress responses in these mutantsare deregulated (Fig 6).

Discussion
Fission yeast shares several conserved histone acetyltransferases with other eukaryotes. In the GNAT
family, the Elp3 (KAT9) and Gcn5 (KAT2) enzymes
are highly conserved [7]. In the MYST family, the Kat5
HAT Esa1/Tip60/Mst1 protein is also highly conserved. However, the relationships between the other
MYST family members are less clear-cut. In budding
yeast, two additional MYST proteins ScSas2 and
ScSas3 have been characterized. ScSas2 antagonizes
ScSir2 in telomere silencing as a component of the
SAS complex. ScSas3, a component of NuA3 [16],
overlaps with Gcn5 such that a double mutant Sc gcn5
sas3 is lethal [26]. By contrast, there is only one additional MYST protein in S. pombe, Mst2, which resembles both S. cerevisiae proteins in primary sequence.
Like ScSas2, SpMst2 antagonizes SpSir2 in telomere

silencing [11], while work from this study suggests that
like ScSas3, SpMst2 acetylates histone H3K14. This
works shows that SpMst2 functions similarly to both
ScSas2 and ScSas3. To dissect out the relationship
between these potentially overlapping HAT enzymes
Mst2, Elp3 and Gcn5, we compared their phenotypic
and transcriptional interactions in S. pombe.
First, we performed the initial characterization of the
catalytic HAT, Elp3, which is the likely catalytic subunit
of the Elongator complex in S. pombe. The strain elp3 is
viable, although it suffers defects in overall cell growth.
It shows a delay in entry into the cell cycle, and premature cell cycle exit (Fig. 1B). It should be noted that
some of the phenotypes seen in Elp3 defective strains
could result from defects in other functions that have
been reported for the Elongator complex in addition to
its role as a HAT [39,40]. We next investigated whether
Δelp3 shows genetic interactions with mutations in
other non-essential HAT genes encoded by gcn5+ and
mst2+. Double and triple mutants are all viable, although
they show increasingly severe growth defects as more
HAT genes are mutated. The viability of SpΔmst2
Δgcn5 contrasts with the lethality of ScΔsas3 Δgcn5 and
suggests that Mst2 is not a simple equivalent of ScSas3.
Alternatively, there may be another enzyme in fission
yeast, which provides an additional degree of redundancy. We suggest that Mst2 fulfills many of the functions associated with both ScSas2 and ScSas3 (see
below).

Figure 6 Venn diagram of differentially down and up-regulated GO terms of mst1ts mutant compared to single, double, and triple
HAT mutants. (Additional File 1) Strain list: Strain list: wild-type (FY261), mst1ts (FY2535) Δelp3 (FY 3851), Δgcn5 (FY2943), Δmst2 (FY1890), Δgcn5
Δelp3 (FY3847), Δgcn5 Δmst2(FY3361), Δmst2 Δelp3 (FY3850), Δgcn5 Δelp3 Δmst2 (3854).

Phenotypic analysis suggests distinct effects of each
HAT. For example, as shown previously Δgcn5 mutants
are de-repressed for mating and meiosis functions, and
are sensitive to certain salt-stress conditions [27,28].
Δmst2 mutants show modest sensitivity to DNA damaging agents such as HU and MMS. Δgcn5 Δmst2 double
mutants show significantly increased salt sensitivity, and
a modest increase in DNA damage sensitivity relative to
single mutants. Thus, we conclude that in response to
salt stress, Gcn5 and Mst2 have a substantial functional
overlap. In contrast, Δgcn5 Δelp3 and Δmst2 Δelp3
showed less evidence for synthetic phenotypes, with
only a modest increase in TBZ sensitivity in Δgcn5
Δelp3 relative to the parents (Fig. 1C &1D). In fact, Elp3
appears to be antagonistic to Mst2, because Δelp3 suppresses Δmst2 mutant sensitivity to high salt concentrations and HU. We speculate this could be due to
slowing down the growth of Δmst2 cells, allowing time
for the cells to repair any damage that may have
occurred. Together, these data suggest that Gcn5 affects
multiple pathways, some overlapping with Elp3, and
others overlapping with Mst2. However, since the double mutants and even the triple mutants are viable,
either additional HAT enzymes play a role, or the acetylation modifications controlled by these enzymes are not
strictly essential for viability.
To determine whether the functional redundancy
between HATs is at the level of gene expression, we
performed transcriptional profiling using DNA microarrays of Δelp3, Δgcn5, and Δmst2. Similar to previous
results with Δgcn5 [27,28] we found that few genes were
affected by deletion of any single HAT gene under
favorable growth conditions. Although HATs are presumed to be gene activators that facilitate transcriptional

initiation or elongation [5], we found that gene expression was as likely to be increased as reduced in our
mutant strains. Up-regulated genes could represent
indirect targets, although many Gcn5-repressed genes
are known to be bound by Gcn5 [37]. This suggests that
Gcn5 may play a direct role in gene repression, which
has been described previously [27]. It is thus possible
that the other HATs studied here also play direct roles
in transcriptional repression.
When we examined the double mutants, we found
that their gene expression profiles were not simply the
combination of the profiles from the two single mutants,
but affected additional genes. This supports the hypothesis that the HATs play partly redundant roles in gene
regulation, with multiple enzymes contributing to
expression of common targets. Importantly, although
they may affect common genes, the regulatory mechanisms may be distinct. In budding yeast, although ScGcn5
and ScElp3 affect transcription of the ScHsp70 genes
ScSSA3 and ScSSA4, this occurs by different mechanisms because Gcn5 is required for transcription factor
binding while Elp3 is required for proper Pol II elongation [41]. However, we have shown that in fission yeast
SpGcn5 also has a role in transcriptional elongation [37]
which could suggest a more direct mechanistic overlap
for SpGcn5 and SpElp3 in this species.
Only one gene was significantly increased in all
strains: the RecQ-type DNA helicase SPBCPT2R1.08c,
located in the sub-telomere domain (Tlh2; [32,33]). We
showed previously that Δmst2 increases silencing at the
telomere and in telomere associated regions, consistent
with a role for Mst2 in antagonizing Sir2. Loss of Mst2
results in a loss of overall H4 acetylation [11] and H3K9
acetylation in Δmst2 in a very limited region adjacent to

Nugent et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:59
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/59

the telomere 18 kb from the end. Interestingly, this
region is telomere-distal to the tlh2 helicase gene
located 13 kb from the end of the telomere chromosome II, which is highly up-regulated in the mutant. In
contrast, genes at 27.5, 29 and 31 kb away from the telomere are down-regulated in Δmst2 (SPAC186.06,
SPAC186.05 and SPBCPT2R1.02 respectively), while at
47 kb telomere distal (SPAC869.01), there is no change
in expression levels. This suggests a gradient effect on
transcription of genes in these regions.
The few genes that are down-regulated in Δgcn5 are
localized near the ends of chromosome I and II which
suggest that the repression might be due to spreading of
heterochromatin by loss of H3K9ac. The combined
effect of the double mutant may indicate a combination
of effects associated with loss of both histone H3K9 and
H3K14 acetylation. Clearly, there are specific regions at
the telomeres that are regulated by specific HATs but
more work needs to be done to fully understand the
boundaries of the telomeres and the regulation between
the highly heterochromatic region and the rest of the
chromosome.
We used gene ontology (GO) classification to define
the functional roles of the few genes that were differentially expressed in single mutants. We found that those
in Δelp3 and Δgcn5, but not Δmst2 associated with a
few distinct classes. Consistent with previous results
[27], Δgcn5 mutants showed increased expression of
specific sexual differentiation genes as well as enrichment for GO terms [34] related to mating and meiosis.
Gcn5 represses transcription of ste11+ [27], which is
an important regulator of the mating pathway in
response to nutrient limitation. Although we find very
similar functional groups that are positively regulated in
the absence of Δgcn5, we did not see evidence for
induction of ste11 above our threshold level (Table 1).
Consistent with prior work, our study also found that
mei2 + was up-regulated in Δgcn5 [27]; this was also
seen for mst1 ts and to a lesser extent Δmst2 (Fig 3),
indicating multiple inputs into this essential regulator of
sexual development. The Δgcn5 Δmst2 mutant increased
mei2+ and ste11+ mRNA levels above those observed in
the single mutants, suggesting these two HATs function
redundantly in repression. It is possible that they might
also have non-histone targets in common since the
repression of mei2+ expression by Gcn5 was suggested
to be mediated by a histone independent mechanism
[27].
In contrast, deletion of Δelp3 results in loss of mei2+
transcription and in the Δgcn5 Δelp3 and Δmst2 Δelp3
double mutants there is also a reduction of mei2+ transcription. Even the triple mutant shows lower levels of
mei2+ than the Δgcn5 Δmst2 double mutant, suggesting
that Δelp3 has an opposite effect on mei2+ transcription

Page 12 of 16

than Δgcn5. Interestingly transcription of SPAC1039.02,
a putative phosphoesterase, shows a similar, but opposite, regulation pattern as it is down-regulated in Δgcn5,
mst1 ts and Δmst2 while being up-regulated in Δelp3.
Thus, for some targets, Gcn5 and Mst2 appear to overlap, while Elp3 appears to be antagonistic. This finding
suggests that the common model linking HAT enzymes
with gene activation is to simplistic. Dissecting the contribution of each HAT to gene expression or other
effects will require future molecular studies mapping the
histone acetylation and physical binding of HATs at different gene regions or their association with the transcription machinery.
To determine the molecular basis for the overlap of
HAT targets, we examined histone H3 acetylation.
Three acetylation sites on histone H3 are associated
with gene expression: K9, K14, and K18 [42]. H3K9 is
acetylated in euchromatin, but methylated in heterochromatin; consistent with other species, our data indicate that Gcn5 is the primary contributor to H3K9Ac
because acetylation of this residue is strongly reduced in
Δgcn5 but relatively unperturbed by the other HAT
mutations.
H3K14 acetylation is also associated with gene expression [42]. Mutations that change the H3K14 residue display hypersensitivity to KCl and CaCl2 induced stress in
Δgcn5 cells [37]. Little or no H3K14 acetylation is
observed in the Δgcn5 Δmst2 double mutant. Consistent
with this, we observed that Δgcn5 Δmst2 is significantly
more salt-sensitive than either single mutation. We conclude that these two HATs both contribute to H3K14
acetylation in response to stress. Importantly, this acetylation is not essential for viability in S. pombe. Data
from budding yeast also indicates an overlap between
ScSas3 and ScGcn5 in H3K14 acetylation [26]. Interestingly, the budding yeast data also suggest that Δsas3 is
not lethal in combination with disruption of other
SAGA subunits that are essential for Gcn5 activity
against histones, and deletion of histone N-terminal H3
tails entirely is not lethal in budding yeast [26]. Thus,
the essential redundant function of these enzymes may
not be in histone modification. It is now well-established
that HAT proteins acetylate substrates other than histones [43]. Perhaps it is one such substrate that relies
on Gcn5 or Sas3 in budding yeast, but on a different
enzyme in fission yeast. These results indicate that Mst2
has functions in common with both budding yeast
enzymes.
Finally, we found that as expected there was little
overlap between expression profiles in the non-essential
HAT mutant strains, and cells with a temperature sensitive mutation of the essential HAT mst1 + . Mst1 is
known to be required for DNA damage response and
chromosome segregation [38]. However, we did not see

Nugent et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:59
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/59

a significant increase in GO terms related to these functions, which is consistent with data suggesting its effects
are not mediated through the transcriptional program
[44]. There was a significant overlap of regulated genes
between Mst1 and the triple mutant Δgcn5 Δmst2
Δelp3, as half of the genes regulated in the triple mutant
were also regulated in mst1ts. When we compared the
regulated GO terms from mst1 ts and Δgcn5 Δelp3
Δmst2 we found that these mutants shared terms related
to metal and ion homeostasis, metal transports as well
as regulation of meiosis. Since both strains show severe
growth defects under the conditions employed, we suggest that these overlaps may represent the effects of
general cellular stress rather than a particular transcriptional program.

required to investigate the direct contributions of these
HATs to individual genes, as opposed to selected regulation of other transcriptional master regulators.

Methods
Strains, media, and manipulations

Strains used in this study are listed in Table 3. Strains
were grown and maintained on yeast extract plus supplements (YES) or Edinburgh minimal media (EMM)
with appropriate supplements, using standard techniques [45]. Matings were performed on synthetic sporulation agar (SPAS) plates for 2-3 days at 25°C. Double
mutants were constructed by standard tetrad analysis or
random spore analysis. G418 plates were YES supplemented with 100 μg/ml G418 (Sigma).
Deletion of elp3+

Conclusions
We isolated and characterized the putative Elongator
HAT Elp3, showing Δelp3 cells are delayed in the cell
cycle relative to wild-type cells, and then compared it to
other HAT mutants. Our study suggests, through analysis of single, double and triple mutants of MYST and
GNAT family HATs, that histone acetyltransferases play
partially redundant role in gene regulation, and that
their role can be positive, or negative for the transcription of genes. We found evidence for significant redundancy between Mst2 and Gcn5 in regulation of stress
response, and response to DNA damage. We found that
different HAT families can share specificity for a common lysine residue in histone H3, thereby contributing
to the modulation of gene expression. For example, we
found that Gcn5 and Mst2 both acetylate histone H3
lysine 14. This work highlights the functional redundancies of different HAT families on transcription, salt
response, and DNA damage repair. Future work will be

The elp3 deletion strain was created from a diploid strain
purchased from Bioneer http://www.bioneer.com. The
strain (h+/h+, elp3+/elp3::KanMX6, leu1-32/leu1-32,
ura4-D18/ura4-D18, ade6-M210/ade6-M216) was haplodized by TBZ treatment to induce mitotic instability and
chromosome loss. The cells were plated on YE media
without adenine to select for red and pink colonies followed by selection for G418 resistant clones. The isolates
were checked with PCR to assure the deletion and
KanMX6 cassette was in the right place then back-crossed
into a wt strain (h-, leu1-32, ura4-D18, ade6-M216).
Growth Assays

Wild type and Δelp3 cells were grown to stationary
phase >1 × 108 cells/ml and then diluted in YES media
to four different concentration 1 × 104, 1 × 105, 4 × 105
and 1 × 10 6 cells/ml respectively and grown at 30°C.
Cells were counted regularly for 48 hours generating
growth curves to cover the beginning and end of the
exponential growth.

Damage assays

Cells were grown to mid-log phase, serially diluted fivefold and spotted onto YES plates or YES plates were
irradiated with the indicated doses of UV irradiation
using a Stratalinker (Stratagene) or YES plates containing 10 or 12 μg/ml thiabendazole (TBZ), 5 mM hydroxyurea (HU), 7 μM camptothecin (CPT), 0.005% methyl
methanesulfonate (MMS) and incubated for 2-3 days at
32°C. For the salt sensitivity assays cells were plated out
in five-fold dilution series on rich media (YES) plates
with or without KCl (1 M or 1.5 M) or CaCl2 (0.1 M or
0.25 M) at either 30°C or 36°C for 2 to 4 days.
RNA prep and Microarray protocols for Affymetrix and
Eurogenetech

RNA was isolated from three independent isolates growing at 30-32 degrees Celsius using phenol/chloroform
extraction [45], phase lock gels (Eppendorf) and resuspended into TE after ethanol precipitation. Biotinylated
cRNA was prepared for Affymetrix array analysis from 5
ug Total RNA using the standard Affymetrix one-cycle
target labeling protocol. Samples were assayed for gene
expression using Affymetrix GeneChip Yeast Genome
2.0 arrays consisting of probe sets representing 5,031
genes in S. pombe based on Sanger (June 2004). Data
was analyzed using the R statistical environment. Affymetrix CEL files were processed and normalized using
RMA [46]. The linear modeling package Limma [47]
was used to calculate p-values and derive gene expression coefficients and to identify differentially expressed
genes. The data discussed in this publication have been
deposited in NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus [48] and
are accessible through GEO Series accession numbers
GSE17259 and GSE17262 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
geo/query/acc.cgi?token=dzmlrwoyekgmypk&acc=GSE17298. For microarrays using the Eurogenetech platform (salt sensitivity analysis), sample
collection, processing and normalization was performed
as in [28]. Genes were considered differentially
expressed if the mutant/wt ratio was greater than 3.25
log 2 fold, with a p-value of 0.05 or less. Additional File
5 lists genes differentially expressed with a mutant/wt
ratio of 1.7 log 2 fold, with a p-value of 0.05 or less.
qPCR

Primers for the entire S. pombe genome were created by
Chris Seidel using uPrimer. Total RNA in the amount
of 2-4 ug was treated with DNase (Turbo DNase Treatment Ambion #AM1907) and 200-600 ng of the treated
RNA was converted to cDNA by RT-PCR with the use
of two primers. The concentration and sequence for the
primers are 2 ng/uL final for the random primer pdN15 and 20 ng/uL final for the anchored oligo-dT OdT19N. A Corbett robot was used to load PCR reactions in
384-well plate format for analysis on an ABI-7900. Standard curves for the 9 primer pairs were made with 5

Page 14 of 16

ten-fold dilutions of gDNA starting with 1000 ng/15 uL
qPCR reaction and ending with 0.1 ng/15 uL qPCR
reaction. The qPCR experiment consisted of measuring
9 loci in 24 samples three times each. 8 ng of the cDNA
was used in each qPCR reaction without purification of
the RT reaction. The final primer concentration was 500
nM each.
Venn diagram program, GO term analysis

Venn diagrams were made using VENNY (Oliveros, J.C.
(2007) VENNY. An interactive tool for comparing lists
with Venn Diagrams http://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/
venny/index.html). Gene ontology classifications were
classified at http://amigo.geneontology.org with the database filter set as GeneDB S. pombe with a threshold of
maximum p value of 0.05 and minimum number of
gene products of 2. We selected for publication only the
biological process classifications.
Histone acetylation

Cell lysates was obtained as described by [49] with the
following modifications; the volume of the cell cultures
were increased 2.5 times to get enough material for 10
or more gels. Briefly cells were inoculated in YES and
grown overnight (o/n) to 1 × 10 7 cells/ml in a total
volume of 25 ml and harvested in room temperature
(RT) by centrifugation, washed once in H2O then resuspended in 0.75 ml H2O and an equal volume of 0.6 M
NaOH, incubated 10 minutes at RT. Cells were
removed from the NaOH by centrifugation and dissolved in 175 μl of modified SDS-sample buffer (60
mMTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% b-mercaptethanol, 4% SDS,
0.01% BPB, and 5% glycerol). Approximately 15 μl were
used to run on precast gradient gels (Bio-Rad, 1611105). Transfer was performed using the iBlot™ Dry
Blotting system (Invitrogen). After transfer the membranes were blocked in in PBS containing 3% milk for
30 min at RT followed by o/n incubation at 4°C with
primary antibody (anti-histones); or blocked o/n at 4°C
followed by incubation with anti-actin antibody, at a
1:12 000 dilution (ms ab8224, Abcam) 1 hour at RT.
For detection of histones antibodies the following dilutions were used: H3 Cter 1:200 (ab1791, Abcam);
H3K9Ac 1:500 (07-352, Upstate); H3K14Ac 1:200 (07353, Upstate); H3K18 Ac 1:200 (07-354, Upstate). For
detection IgG horseradish peroxidase (GE Healthcare)
against mouse and rabbit respectively was used along
with ECL Plus (GE Healthcare) and exposed to film for
20 seconds to 3 minutes.
