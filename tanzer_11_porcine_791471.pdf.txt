Abstract
Background: One of the promising avenues for development of vaccines against Human immunodeficiency virus
type 1 (HIV-1) and other human pathogens is the use of plasmid-based DNA vaccines. However, relatively large
doses of plasmid must be injected for a relatively weak response. We investigated whether genome elements from
Porcine circovirus type 1 (PCV-1), an apathogenic small ssDNA-containing virus, had useful expression-enhancing
properties that could allow dose-sparing in a plasmid vaccine.
Results: The linearised PCV-1 genome inserted 5’ of the CMV promoter in the well-characterised HIV-1 plasmid
vaccine pTHgrttnC increased expression of the polyantigen up to 2-fold, and elicited 3-fold higher CTL responses
in mice at 10-fold lower doses than unmodified pTHgrttnC. The PCV-1 capsid gene promoter (Pcap) alone was
equally effective. Enhancing activity was traced to a putative composite host transcription factor binding site and a
“Conserved Late Element” transcription-enhancing sequence previously unidentified in circoviruses.
Conclusions: We identified a novel PCV-1 genome-derived enhancer sequence that significantly increased antigen
expression from plasmids in in vitro assays, and improved immunogenicity in mice of the HIV-1 subtype C vaccine
plasmid, pTHgrttnC. This should allow significant dose sparing of, or increased responses to, this and other
plasmid-based vaccines. We also report investigations of the potential of other circovirus-derived sequences to be
similarly used.

Background
Plasmid vaccines are increasingly accepted as being useful for priming cytolytic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses
against pathogens in heterologous prime-boost vaccine
regimens [1-3]. However, while plasmid vaccines elicit
strong cellular immune responses in small mammals,
they have elicited less potent responses in clinical trials,
and large or repeated doses appear to be necessary in
order to prime strong CTL responses in humans [4].
The antigen-encoding transgene in a plasmid vaccine
vector for mammalian use is expressed intracellularly in
vaccinated hosts, under the control of mammalian cellcompatible transcription and mRNA processing signals,
including promoters, Kozak sequences, introns, and

polyadenylation sequences [5]. A number of vaccine
design modifications are being investigated with a view
to improving plasmid vaccine immunogenicity and
thereby reducing the dose necessary for a strong CTL
response [2,5,6]. One approach is to improve expression
of the plasmid encoded antigen so that smaller doses
will still elicit effective immune responses.
Mammalian DNA viruses with small genomes could
be expected to be good sources of regulatory elements
for gene expression, and a number of expression control
elements derived from mammalian viruses have been
tested to date for their expression-enhancing potential
in plasmid vaccines [7,8]. The human cytomegalovirus
immediate/early promoter/enhancer element (CMV I/E)
is the most commonly used promoter (Pcmv) in DNA
vaccine plasmids, as it is one of the strongest known
promoter elements in mammalian gene expression systems [2,5]. However, there is potential for Pcmv activity

to be further improved by the addition of heterologously
derived promoter or enhancer sequences. Circoviruses
(family Circoviridae) are small viruses with circular single-stranded DNA genomes that form histone-bound
double-stranded replicative form mini-episomes in the
host nucleus and subsequently replicate by rolling circle
replication (RCR) [9]. Circoviruses infect avian and porcine hosts and include, among others, Beak and feather
disease virus (BFDV) of psittacines [10,11], and Porcine
circovirus type 1 (PCV-1) [12,13] and Porcine circovirus
type 2 (PCV-2) [14]. PCV-2 is the causative organism
for post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome
(PMWS) in pigs [15,16]. By contrast, PCV-1, originally
isolated from the porcine kidney cell line PK-15 [17], is
non-pathogenic in any species tested to date including
humans [16,18,19]. Like other circoviruses PCV-1 has a
compact, genetically dense, bi-directionally transcribed
genome of 1759 bp (Figure 1). The ambisense genome
of PCV-1 encodes only the genes cap, encoding the viral
capsid protein, and rep, which encodes the replication
associated proteins Rep and Rep’, the latter being

Page 2 of 10

a shorter spliced variant of Rep having the same Nterminus, but with a frame-shifted C-terminus [20,21].
Rep and cap are divergently transcribed from an 82 bp
intergenic region which contains the viral origin of
replication (Ori) and the rep gene promoter (Prep)
which overlaps the viral Ori [12,22]. Prep is negatively
regulated by the full length rep gene product, Rep [22].
The cap promoter (Pcap), shown in Figure 2 is
embedded in an intron within the rep gene [23], and is
activated by host transcription factors [22].
In this study, we investigated the potential utility of
the PCV-1 genome as a source of promoter or enhancer
sequences for improving antigen expression in an existing HIV-1 subtype C vaccine plasmid, pTHgrttnC,
which has been extensively and successfully tested for
immunogenicity in both mouse and primate models
[3,24,25]. pTHgrttnC encodes a modified synthetic polyantigen, GrttnC, comprising HIV-1C Gag, reverse transcriptase (RT), Tat and Nef sequences fused into a
polyprotein. The human codon-optimised grttnC
sequence is expressed under the control of Pcmv, the
CMV intron A and the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal on the plasmid vaccine vector, pTH
[24,26]. We report here the testing of PCV-1 elements
in the test vaccine plasmid pTHgrttnC in terms of their
ability to significantly increase GrttnC antigen expression in cell culture and to markedly improve the CTL
immune response to an immunodominant GrttnC CD8
epitope in mice, compared to pTHgrttnC. We also
report on the expression enhancement of the SV-40
early promoter by a PCV element, and the potential for
sequences derived from other circoviruses to enhance
expression from the CMV I/E promoter in pTHgrttnC.

Methods
Figure 1 PCV genome arrangement and cloning scheme. A.
Diagram of the linearised PCV-1 genome, depicted in the
orientation cloned into pTHCapgrttnC. The rep intron is shown
enlarged, and the capsid gene promoter (Pcap) is indicated. The
core and Conserved Late Element (CLE) components of Pcap are
shown enlarged. Abbreviations: rep = replication associated protein
gene, cap = capsid protein gene, Prep = rep gene promoter, Ori =
origin of replication, core = composite host transcription factor
binding site. B. Schema of expression cassettes for pTH and pGL3promoter based plasmid constructs. Whole genome and Pcap PCV-1
DNA inserts were inserted in either orientation into pTHgrttnC,
pTHluc and pGL3-promoter plasmids. Plasmids were designated as
Cap when whole genome PCV-1 DNA was inserted in the
orientation shown in A, or as Rep when the genome was inserted
in the opposite orientation. Plasmids were designated as Pcap when
Pcap DNA was inserted in the orientation shown in A, or as PcapR
when the Pcap fragment was inserted in the opposite orientation.
The Pcap core DNA fragment and the CLE fragment (orientation
independent hairpin structure) were cloned into pTHgrttnC only.
Plasmids were designated as C when the Pcap core fragment was
cloned in the orientation shown in A, and as CR when in the
opposite orientation.

Plasmid construction

The PCV-1 genome (identical to GenBank Accession
U49186) [27] was obtained by PCR amplification with
overlapping primers from cultured porcine kidney cells
PK-15 (CCL-33) from the ATCC (KE Palmer, unpublished). A blunt-ended linearised 1759 bp sequence so
derived was cloned in pCI (Promega). The PCV-1 genome with Spe I sites added on either end was reassembled in pUC18 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
as detailed previously [28], sequence verified, and subcloned into the unique Spe I site immediately upstream
(5’) of and adjacent to the CMV I/E promoter in
pTHgrttnC 24. and into the Nhe I site immediately
upstream of the SV40 early promoter in pGL3-promoter
(Promega). Clones were selected containing PCV-1
inserts in either orientation, to yield pTHRepgrttnC and
pGL3Rep with the PCV-1 rep gene promoter (Prep) in
the same sense as the resident promoter, and
pTHCapgrttnC and pGL3Cap, with the PCV-1 cap gene

promoter (Pcap) in the same sense as the resident promoter (see Figure 1).
By combining observations from the Pcap expression
study by Mankertz & Hillenbrand [22] with a Transcompel database [29] search for consensus transcription
factor (TF) binding sites, we identified a 172 bp DNA
fragment containing the PCV-1 capsid promoter region
(Pcap). We used PCR to amplify this from the cloned
genome and to add Spe I sites to both ends, using primers PcapF (5’-TTACTAGTCATATGGAGCAGTTCC
CTGTAACG-3’) and PcapR (5’-TTACTAGTAGGTG
TCGCTAGGCTCAGC-3’). After sequence verification
the fragment was sub-cloned in either orientation into
Spe I-digested pTHgrttnC or Nhe I-digested pGL3-promoter, to yield pTHPcapgrttnC and pTHPcapRgrttnC,

pGL3Pcap and pGL3PcapR. In pTHPcapgrttnC and
pGL3Pcap, Pcap was oriented in the same sense towards
the grttnC or luc transgenes as it would be in PCV-1 for
cap transcription, as in pTHCapgrttnC or pGL3Cap. In
pTHPcapRgrttnC and pGL3PcapR, the Pcap fragment
was inserted in the opposite orientation.
We searched the Transcompel database to more narrowly define active transcription-enhancing sequence in
Pcap, and identified a 70 bp putative “core” Pcap sequence.
This was assembled as a “pre-cut” Spe I - flanked heat
annealed fragment from an 10 uM equimolar mixture of
HPLC-purified phosphorylated oligonucleotides, PCV-1
Fwd-A, PCV-1 Fwd-B, PCV-1 Rev-C, PCV-1/PCV-2 RevD (sequences are shown in Table 1), and ligated into Spe
I-digested pTHgrttnC. Insert presence, number and

orientation were determined by PCR, using appropriate
combinations of primers PCV-1 Fwd-A and PCV-1/PCV2 Rev-D, and the pTH-specific primers pTH3F (5’-CGA
TAGAGGCGACATCAAGC-3’) and pTH4R (5’-CCCA
TAAGGTCATGTACTGG-3’), and sizing PCR products
against a 100 bp DNA ladder (Fermentas). Resultant plasmids pTHCgrttnC and pTHCRgrttnC had single copies of
the Pcap core, and corresponded in orientation to
pTHPcapgrttnC and pTHPcapRgrttnC respectively.
Whole-genome sequence alignments (DNAMAN Lynnon Biosoft ver. 6, Quebec, Canada) between PCV-1
(U49186), PCV-2 (Accession number: AY256460) and a
South African isolate of Beak and feather disease virus
(BFDV-AFG3-ZA, Accession number AY450443) [11]
were used to locate the PCV-1 Pcap core sequence
equivalents in PCV-2 and BFDV-AFG3-ZA. Deduced
Pcap core sequences from PCV-2 and BFDV-AFG3-ZA
were assembled as above, using oligonucleotides PCV-2
Fwd-P, PCV-2 Fwd-Q, PCV-2 Rev-R and PCV-1/PCV-2
Rev-D for the PCV-2 core (Table 1) and oligonucleotides BFDV Fwd-W, BFDV Fwd-X, BFDV Rev-Y and
BFDV Rev-Z for the BFDV-AFG3-ZA core (Table 1).
The assembled sequences were cloned into pTHgrttnC
as above, and insert detection was carried out as above,
using appropriate combinations of primers pTH3F,
pTH4R, PCV-2 Fwd-P, PCV-1/PCV-2 Rev-D, BFDV
Fwd-W, or BFDV Rev-Z, to yield the analogous plasmids, pTHC2grttnC and pTHC2RgrttnC (corresponding
to Pcap and PcapR orientations, respectively) for PCV-2.
pTHgrttnC constructs containing either a monomer or
a trimer of the BFDV-AFG3-ZA Pcap core sequence
were similarly selected, yielding pTHCBgrttnC and
pTHCB3grttnC.
Because of the similarity in genetic organisation and
phylogenetic relationship between circoviruses and
geminiviruses [30], we used DNAMAN ver. 6 to search
the PCV-1 genome for transcription-enhancing DNA

sequence repeats, as previously identified for geminiviruses [31]. We identified a 47 bp PCV-1 fragment
within our cloned PCV-1 Pcap sequence that contained
a consensus “Conserved Late Element” (CLE) sequence
[31,32], which we assembled with flanking “pre-cut” Nhe
I sites from oligonucleotides CLE-Fwd and CLE-Rev
(Table 1) and cloned into Spe I - cut pTHgrttnC as
above. Using primers pTH3F, pTH4R and CLE-Fwd as
above, we selected plasmids pTHCLEgrttnC (containing
a single copy CLE insert) and pTHCLE3grttnC (containing a CLE trimer).
The grttnC ORF was removed from pTHgrttnC by
Hind III-Eco RI digestion and replaced with Hind IIIEco RI-digested luc from pGL3-promoter, to yield
pTHluc. The Spe I-flanked Pcap fragment was cloned in
either orientation into Nhe I-digested pTHluc to give
pTHPcapluc and pTHPcapRluc.
HEK293 cell transfection and protein expression

HEK293 cells (CRC-1573) were maintained in 6-well
culture plates in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium
(DMEM) with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100
μg/ml streptomycin. Transfections were performed 24 h
post plating at 50% to 70% confluence using 1 ug endotoxin-free DNA (prepared from E. coli DH5a cells,
using Qiagen Endofree plasmid kit) and either 3 μ
FuGENE6 (Roche) transfection reagent or its exact
homologue Mirus-LT1 (Mirus). To normalise transfection for those reactions detecting grttnC expression 50
ng pcDNA3.1/Zeo/CAT DNA (Invitrogen) which
encodes the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT)
gene was included in the reaction. Cells were harvested
at 48 h post-transfection and lysed in appropriate buffers for detection of HIV-1 p24 antigen (p24 ELISA, Vironostika, Biomerieux) to detect the GrttnC polyantigen,
luciferase (Luciferase Assay System, Promega) and CAT
(CAT ELIZA, Roche) respectively, according to kit

instructions. p24 levels were normalised against coexpressed CAT levels. Data is reported as the mean
responses for 6 replicate transfection reactions.
GrttnC polyprotein in cell lysates expressed from
pTHgrttnC-based plasmids was detected by western blot
[28] using anti-RT sheep antiserum (ARP428, NISBC
Centralised Facility for AIDS reagents, MRC, UK). HIV1HXB2 RT dimer (51 kDa, 66 kDa; NIH AIDS Research
& Reference Reagent Programme, McKesson BioServices
Corporation, USA) served as a positive control.

with the H-2Kd-restricted RT peptide VYYDPSKDLIA
(> 95% pure peptide, Bachem, Switzerland) at 4 μg/ml
[24]. Spots were detected using Nova Red substrate
(Vector Labs) then scanned and counted using a CTL
Analyzer (Cellular Technology, OH, USA) with Immunospot Version 3.2 software. The mean number of spots
from triplicate wells ± (standard deviation) SD was calculated and background spots (not more than 30 ± 10
sfu/10 6 splenocytes) were subtracted and adjusted to
spot forming units (sfu) per 106 splenocytes to give sfu/
106 splenocytes ± SD.

Immunization of mice

We tested the immunogenicity of pTHCapgrttnC,
pTHPcapgrttnC, and pTHPcapRgrttnC against pTHgrttnC
in 8-10 week old female BALB/c mice. All animal protocols
were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee, UCT
Faculty of Health Sciences (UCT Animal Research Ethics
Committee study reference number 06/012). Initial experiments compared responses to a single 100 μg DNA dose
against two 100 μg doses given 28 days apart, with spleens
harvested 12 days after the final inoculation. Induction of
memory responses by two 10 μg doses of either
pTHCapgrttnC, pTHgrttnC or pTH with no insert, given
28 days apart, was evaluated by the ability of SAAVI MVAC (MVA; 104 pfu) - a modified vaccinia strain Ankara vector which encodes the GrttnC polyantigen [24] - to boost
the response. MVA was given on day 56 and spleens harvested on day 68. Endotoxin-free DNA in PBS (Sigma) for
murine immunization was prepared using either the Endofree plasmid preparation kit (Qiagen) following manufacturer’s instructions or manufactured commercially
(Aldevron, Fargo, USA). MVA was at 104 pfu per 100 μl in
1 mM Tris, pH 9.0 as detailed previously [3,25].
Groups of female BALB/c mice (5 mice per group)
were immunized after anaesthaesia with ketamine:xylazine (10:1). Plasmid (100 μg or 10 μg) and MVA (104
pfu) inoculations [3,24] were given as intramuscular
injections in a final volume of 100 μl with 50 μl injected
into each hind leg muscle.
IFN-g ELISPOT assay

The number of IFN-g secreting CD8+ T cells responding to the RT CD8 peptide, as a measure of the
response to GrttnC, was evaluated in an IFN-g ELISPOT
assay (Mouse IFN-g ELISPOT set; BD Pharmingen).
Spleens from each group were pooled and a single cell
suspension of splenocytes was prepared and treated with
erythrocyte lysing buffer (0.15 M NH 4 Cl, 10 mM
KHCO 3 , 0.1 mM Na 2 EDTA) for 1 min at room temperature. Splenocytes were plated in triplicate at 500
000 cells/well in a final volume of 200 μl R10 medium
(RPMI-1640 with 10% heat inactivated FCS, 15 mM bmercaptoethanol, 100 U penicillin per ml, and 100 μg
streptomycin) to determine the background response or

Statistical analysis

Data was statistically analyzed using Student’s t test.
P values of <0.05 were considered significant.

Results
Constructs

For ease of making comparisons between studies the
PCV-1 DNA sequences used in this study were numbered to match the PCV-1 sequence Y09921 [12]. Thus,
the PCV-1 genome cloned into pTHRepgrttnC,
pTHCapgrttnC, pGL3Rep and pGL3Cap was linearised
within the capsid gene between nucleotides (nt) corresponding to 151 and 152 of Y09921, disrupting the
capsid gene (cap) such that the sequence coding for the
C-terminal 39 aa was separated from the rest of cap
(Figure 1A). The 172 bp PCV-1 Pcap fragment used in
this study corresponded to nt 1389-1218 of Y09921, and
is depicted in Figure 2A. The chosen fragment size was
longer than the minimal Pcap region (1328 - 1252)
mapped by Mankertz & Hillenbrand [22], in order to
maximise the inclusion of previously unidentified putative TF binding sites identified using Transcompel in
the current study. The PCV-1 Pcap core corresponded
to nt 1260 - 1329 of Y09921 (Figure 2B), and the CLE
corresponded to nt 1324 - 1370 of Y09921 (Figure 2C).
The PCV-2 Pcap core corresponded to nt 451 - 520 of
AY256460. The BFDV-AFG3-ZA Pcap core sequence
corresponded to nt 390 - 439 of AY450443.
The 70 bp “core sequence” of Pcap includes a putative
composite host cell TF binding site, comprising C/EBPb,
GATA-1 and CREB recognition/binding sites, as identified
from the Transcompel database. Aligned Pcap core
sequences from PCV-1, PCV-2 and BFDV-AFG-ZA are
shown in Figure 2B. The order of the component putative
C/EBPb, GATA-1 and CREB recognition/binding sites differs between the porcine and avian circoviruses. The putative composite TF site arrangement in the BFDV Pcap
sequence is typical of that found in avian circoviruses.

Western blots probed with an RT antiserum indicated
pTHCapgrttnC, pTHPCapgrttnC and pTHPCapRgrttnC

expressed a protein with an apparent molecular weight
identical to that expressed by pTHgrttnC (Additional
File 1 Figure S1). Although pTHRepgrttnC showed
enhanced GrttnC expression over pTHgrttnC in early
experiments, the construct was genetically unstable.
For this reason it was not used in further experiments.
GrttnC polyantigen expression quantified using the
p24 antigen ELISA indicated pTHCapgrttnC - with
the whole genome PCV-1 insert - expressed a 2.1
fold higher level of p24 than the parent pTHgrttnC
(p < 0.01) (Figure 3A). The 172 bp PCV-1 Pcap fragment did not significantly influence GrttnC expression;
however, the PCapR fragment induced a 1.5 fold
higher level (p < 0.05) of GrttnC expression than
pTHgrttnC (Figure 3A). We next compared GrttnC

expression of pTHpCapgrttnC with the following constructs: pTHCgrttnC and pTHCRgrttnC, containing
PCV-1 Pcap core sequence and corresponding in
orientation to pTHPcapgrttnC and pTHPcapRgrttnC
respectively; pTHC2grttnC and pTHC2RgrttnC, containing PCV-2 Pcap core sequence; pTHCB3grttnC, a
trimer of the deduced BFDV Pcap core, and
pTHCLEgrttnC and pTHCLE3grttnC, containing a
CLE monomer or trimer respectively (Figure 3B). Significantly higher expression of GrttnC (p < 0.01) was
only achieved with plasmids pTHCRgrttnC (2.4 fold)
and pTHC2RgrttnC (2.5 fold) (Figure 3B). GrttnC
expression for pTHCLE3grttnC was 1.9 fold greater
than pTHpCapgrttnC (p < 0.05) (Figure 3B).

In order to test whether the PCV-1 sequence enhanced
gene expression in promoter contexts other than the
CMV I/E promoter in pTH, we constructed plasmids
pGL3Cap, containing whole-genome PCV-1 DNA, and
pGL3PCap and pGL3PCapR, containing PCV-1 PCap
DNA, where the PCV-1 DNA was inserted immediately
upstream of the SV40 early promoter (Figure 1B).
Plasmids pTHluc, pTHPcapluc and pTHPcapRluc
(Figure 1B) were also constructed to compare luciferase
expression by Pcap-CMV I/E and Pcap-SV40 dual promoter constructs. This would also test the ability of the
PCV-1 Pcap-CMV I/E promoter combination to express
transgenes other than grttnC.
Significantly greater luciferase expression above that of
the parent plasmid pGL3-promoter (p < 0.01) was
achieved only with pGL3Pcap (2 fold) and pGL3PcapR
(3 fold) (Figure 4). The CMV I/E promoter-based plasmids also expressed luciferase; however, there was no
difference in luciferase levels expressed by pTHluc,
pTHPCapluc and pTHPCapR (Figure 4). The CMV I/E
promoter-based plasmids expressed a higher average
level of luciferase (25 fold; p < 0.01) than pGL3Pcap and
pGL3PcapR (Figure 4).

Immunogenicity

Responses to the polyantigen grttnC were determined as
the response to the RT CD8 peptide in the IFN-g ELISPOT assay, as this amino acid sequence is known to be
an immunodominant epitope [24]. For all plasmids
a single 100 μg DNA dose induced low responses
of less than 30 net sfu/106 splencoytes to the RT CD8
peptide (not shown). Vaccination with 2 doses of
pTHCapgrttnC, pTHPcapgrttnC or pTHPcapRgrttnC 28
days apart elicited similar RT peptide responses ranging
from 879 ± 8 - 889 ± 96 sfu/10 6 splenocytes (n = 5)
(Figure 5). These responses were approximately 4.6 fold
(p < 0.01) superior to the RT peptide response (193 ±
19 sfu/106 splenocytes; n = 5) induced by 2 vaccinations

Figure 5 IFN-g ELISPOT responses to the RT CD8 peptide.
Groups of BALB/c mice were intramuscularly vaccinated with the
indicated DNA vaccine doses on day 0 and day 28. Two groups of
mice that were inoculated with 10 μg of DNA were subsequently
boosted intramuscularly with MVA (SAAVI MVA-C, 104 pfu) on day
56. A separate group of mice was vaccinated with pTH (10 μg)
minus insert on day 0 and day 28 then boosted with MVA (104 pfu)
on day 56. For all groups spleens were harvested 12 days after the
last vaccination and splenocytes used in an IFN-g ELISPOT assay
with the RT CD8 peptide. Responses for mice vaccinated with a
DNA dose of 100 μg or 10 μg are the mean sfu/106 splenocytes ±

Discussion
A linearised PCV-1 genome inserted in either orientation
immediately upstream of the resident CMV I/E promoter
(Pcmv) in the proven DNA vaccine pTHgrttnC significantly improved expression of the HIV-1C-derived polyantigen GrttnC. Early results suggested that genome
orientation influenced expression through PCV-1 rep
(pTHRepgrttnC) or cap (pTHCapgrttnC) promoter
effects. Plasmid pTHRepgrttnC was unstable, suggesting
that whole-genome orientation influences stability.
Therefore, given that the effect was the same with either
orientation of the PCV genome, we focused on elucidating the capacity of the PCV-1 capsid promoter Pcap to
act as an expression enhancing element in conjunction
with strong promoters in mammalian expression plasmids. Our chosen PCV-1 Pcap fragment was larger than
the previously identified minimal Pcap [22,23] and
included more putative TF binding sites than those
previously put forward to explain Pcap activity [22].
When the Pcap fragment was cloned in reverse
orientation (PcapR) upstream of Pcmv in pTHgrttnC
(pTHPcapRgrttnC), GrttnC expression was enhanced
to the same level as when the equivalent whole genome PCV-1 construct (pTHCapgrttnC) was used. This
result is compatible with the possibility that PcapR
may act as an upstream transcriptional enhancer for
Prep in the native circular viral genome: circoviruses
have highly compact ambisense genomes and some
regions encode more than one function. In particular,
in PCV-1 one sequence encodes Pcap, part of the rep
gene intron, and the coding sequence for the fulllength Rep protein [23] and lies approximately 1 Kb
upstream of Prep - a feasible distance from Prep for
PcapR sequence to act as an upstream transcription
enhancing sequence for the rep gene [33]. We speculate that the PcapR sequence in pTHRepgrttnC could
have contributed to expression enhancement in
pTHRepgrttnC, although this was not investigated in
this study.
We identified two sequences within Pcap that
enhanced GrttnC expression from Pcmv: these were the
“core” sequence and the CLE (Figure 1 and 2). The
active Pcap “core” sequence included closely situated
consensus DNA binding sites for the transcription factors c/EBPb, the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein
which controls cell cycle progression [34], GATA-1, a
constitutive Zn finger transcription factor [35], and

http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/51

CREB, a cAMP response element-binding protein [36]
binding sites without AP2, SP1 and AP3 binding sites
(Figure 2B). The nucleotide distances between these
sites are consistent with them making up a composite
TF binding site, as identified in other genes such as rat
CYP2D5, with a composite c/EPB-beta/SP1 site [37],
and human gonadotropin alpha-subunit, with a composite CREB/GATA-1 site [38]. This putative C/EBPb/
GATA-1/CREB composite TF binding site was not identified in a 76 bp minimal Pcap fragment [22], where
Pcap activity was tentatively attributed to putative binding sites for AP2, SP1 and AP3 transcription factors.
However, our active Pcap “core” fragment excluded
AP2, SP1 and AP3 binding sites (Figure 2B), and Pcap
promoter activity was previously seen to drop off almost
completely [22], concomitant with the deletion of a fragment that we have currently identified as containing the
putative GATA-1 and CREB sites. This strongly suggests
that the GATA-1 and CREB binding sites, at least, are
crucial to Pcap activity.
We tested constructs carrying other circovirus Pcapcognate core sequences from PCV-2, a pathogenic strain
of PCV, and BFDV-AFG-ZA, an avian circovirus. The
PCV-1 and PCV-2 Pcap core fragments share 80%
sequence identity overall and identical consensus c/
EBPb/GATA-1/CREB binding site sequence and spacing.
The c/EBPb, GATA-1 and CREB TF consensus
sequence and site arrangement in the BFDV-AFG-ZA
Pcap core is typical of avian circoviruses but different
from that of PCV-1 and PCV-2. Equally improved
expression occurred with pTHCRgrttnC (PCV-1) and
pTHCR2grttnC (PCV-2). It thus appears the order and
spacing of TF binding sites in the composite TF binding
site, but not the specific nucleotide sequence between
sites, was important to overall Pcap core activity in
mammalian cells, at least in the current in vitro expression system.
Lying adjacent to the “core” sequence in our chosen
Pcap fragment was a direct repeat of a consensus
sequence AGTGGGCCCG separated by 19 nt and capable of forming a hairpin structure. This was identical
to the transcription enhancing Conserved Late Element
(CLE), first identified as an element in the geminiviruses, which are distantly evolutionarily related to circoviruses, but which infect plants [39]. The CLE was
later found to be a native upstream transcription-enhancing element in a number of bacterial and plant genes,
showing additive increase in activity with number of
CLE units [31,32]. In a sequence database search performed in the current study we made the novel observation that CLE consensus sequences may be found in the
DNA binding sites of zinc finger containing proteins in
a number of genes from all phyla.

Page 8 of 10

We showed that a concatenated PCV-1 CLE trimer
enhanced GrttnC expression over that of pTHPcapgrttnC,
the first demonstration that an identified CLE enhances
gene expression in a mammalian expression system. It has
been observed elsewhere [22] that maximal Pcap expression activity was associated with a sequence that included
putative SP1 and AP3 binding sites (to which the maximal
activity was attributed), but which coincidentally included
the complete CLE. The 47 bp CLE - containing fragment
tested and found active in the present study encompasses
the putative SP1 and AP3 binding sites previously indicated [22], and so a contribution from these TFs cannot
be ruled out.
To exclude the possibility that the observed expression
enhancement in plasmids containing Pcap or its derivatives was fortuitous, we tested three other PCV-1
sub-genomic DNA fragments in pTHgrttnC and pGL3promoter for transgene expression enhancement. These
fragments, ranging in size from 266 - 316 bp, included
putative TF binding sites as identified via Transcompel,
other than any previously identified rep or cap promoter
sequences. None of these fragments in either orientation
showed any transgene expression enhancing ability in
pTHgrttnC or pGL3-promoter (not shown).
On testing PCV-1 promoters in a different transgene
or promoter context, we observed that PCV-1 promoters in whole genome inserts in pGL3-promoter
appeared to be too distant from the SV40 promoter to
affect luciferase expression, but the isolated Pcap fragment brought Pcap into closer proximity with the
SV40 promoter, permitting enhanced luciferase expression. The stronger CMV I/E promoter [5,8] gave
approximately 25 fold more expression in the pTH
context than the SV40 promoter in the pGL3-promoter context. Luciferase expression in pTHluc was not
increased by a Pcap or PcapR insert. Our experience
with other expression systems [28,40] is that one gene
insert may be expressed at significantly higher levels
than another from the same gene control elements.
Thus, the specific contribution of the PCV-1 Pcap element should be empirically determined for each new
transgene tested.
The
PCV-1-containing
vaccine
plasmids
pTHCapgrttnC, pTHPcapgrttnC and pTHPcapRgrttnC
showed significantly improved immunogenicity compared with the parent plasmid, pTHgrttnC. Use of
pTHCapgrttnC clearly showed the potential for dose
sparing, in that 10 ug doses elicited CTL responses in
mice that were comparable to 100 ug doses of
pTHgrttnC. This effect was further improved with an
MVA-grttnC boost. Thus, even at low doses, these DNA
vaccines elicited memory cells capable of responding to
a matched booster vaccine.

Tanzer et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:51

A potential safety concern with using full length PCV1 genome-containing plasmids as DNA vaccines is that
the Rep protein encoded in the PCV-1 genome might
bind to essential host factors involved in regulation of
basic cellular functions. For example, Rep of the related
PCV strain, PCV-2, was shown in vitro to bind c-myc, a
multi-functional transcription factor involved with
aspects of cell regulation, including cell proliferation
and apoptosis [41]. This concern could potentially apply
to pTHCapgrttnC. Thus it is encouraging that
pTHPcapgrttnC and pTHPcapRgrttnC showed similar
immunogenic potential to pTHCapgrttnC. The 172 bp
PCV-1 Pcap sequence included in these constructs has
no involvement with c-myc binding, and so these plasmids are free of the above potential safety concern.

Conclusions
In summary, we have shown the potential for the PCV-1
capsid gene promoter and other circovirus-derived elements to act as an expression enhancing elements in
conjunction with strong mammalian promoters, by
forming a dual promoter with either the CMV I/E promoter or the SV40 early promoter. We traced Pcap
activity to a 70 bp Pcap “core” fragment containing a
putative composite binding site for the host cell transcription factors c/EBPb, GATA-1 and CREB, and to a
47 bp fragment containing a CLE sequence that lies
adjacent to the “core” in the native Pcap of PCV-1. We
showed that a Pcap core sequence from the related circovirus PCV-2 acts in the same way as that from PCV-1
while an avian circovirus “core” sequence showed little
activity in a mammalian cell line, possibly as a result of
the different order and sequence of the consensus c/
EBPb, GATA-1 and CREB binding sites.
The major potential advantage of using a DNA vaccine construct containing PCV sequences lies in dosesparing - an advantage in human trials where conventionally up to 5 mg of plasmid vaccine is used. Alternatively, higher immune responses could be achieved with
the same doses of the enhanced DNA vaccine compared
to already effective conventional versions: recent evidence that higher doses of DNA vaccines given with
genetic adjuvants elicit potent CTL responses mean that
our PCV-derived enhancer may be even more effective
than in our present demonstration [42-44].
