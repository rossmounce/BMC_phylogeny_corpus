Abstract
Background: Feline coronavirus is comprised of two pathogenic biotypes consisting of feline infectious peritonitis
virus (FIPV) and feline enteric coronavirus (FECV), which are both divided into two serotypes. To examine the
prevalence of Korean cats infected with feline coronavirus (FCoV) type I and II, fecal samples were obtained from
212 cats (107 pet and 105 feral) in 2009.
Results: Fourteen cats were FCoV-positive, including infections with type I FCoV (n = 8), type II FCoV (n = 4), and
types I and II co-infection (n = 2). Low seroprevalences (13.7%, 29/212) of FCoV were identified in chronically ill
cats (19.3%, 16/83) and healthy cats (10.1%, 13/129).
Conclusions: Although the prevalence of FCoV infection was not high in comparison to other countries, there was
a higher prevalence of type I FCoV in Korean felines. The prevalence of FCoV antigen and antibody in Korean cats
are expected to gradually increase due to the rising numbers of stray and companion cats.

Background
Feline coronavirus (FCoV) is an enveloped, positivesense, single-stranded RNA virus of the family Coronavirideae within the order Nidovirales. FCoVs are comprised of two pathogenic biotypes [1] consisting of feline
infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) and feline enteric coronavirus (FECV), which are both divided into two serotypes (Type I and II). The serotypes differ in their
growth characteristics in cell culture and antigenicity,
relative to canine coronaviruses (CCoVs) [2].
The prevalence of type I and II FCoV have been surveyed in many countries, including Japan [3], United
States [4], United Kingdom [5], Austria [6], Switzerland [7], and Taiwan [8]. The majority of field isolates
in these countries are of type I, regardless of the assay
method [4].
FCoVs are associated with mild or subclinical enteric
infections [9]. However, in a small proportion of cats,
FCoV infection leads to the development of a lethal,
immune-mediated condition known as feline infectious
peritonitis (FIP) [10,11]. FIP is a complex immune

disease involving virus or viral antigen, antiviral antibodies, and complement. Cats that do not develop antiFCoV antibodies do not develop FIP.
Serological surveys of FCoV infection have involved
detection of antibody by indirect fluorescent antibody
assay (IFA) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) [12-15]. A plaque-reduction neutralization test
(PRNT) was developed to serologically distinguish FCoV
type I and II infections in cats [16].
In a previous study, the number of cats raised in
Seoul, the capital city of South Korea, was reported to
be around 30,000 in 2004 [17]. The most common
breed in Korea is the Korean short hair cat, but this has
been changing the recent years due to the increasing
number of cats that are being raised as companion cats.
Previously, there have been case reports of FIP in a Persian chinchilla (2 years age, female) and a Korean short
hair cat (3 months age, male) [18], but no nationwide
survey for FCoV has been carried out in Korea.
Therefore, the objectives of the current study were to
identify the seroprevalence of FCoV and to classify the
FCoV serotypes in Korean cats in comparison with prevalence in other countries.

Methods
Cat specimens

Feline serum and fecal swab samples were collected
from 212 cats consisting of 107 samples from six local
animal hospitals (four in Seoul and two in Kyunggi) and
105 samples from two animal shelters (Incheon and
Daejeon) in 2009. Of the 212 samples, 129 were from
clinically healthy cats and 83 were from cats displaying
symptoms of illness that included inappetence, anorexia,
weight loss, lethargy, icterus, fever, diarrhea, and thoracic effusion.
RNA extraction and reverse transcription-polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR)

Viral RNA was extracted from fecal samples using TRIzol LS b (Invitrogen, Valencia, CA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Two RT-PCR methods
were used: one enabled the highly sensitive detection in
fecal samples and the other distinguished type I from
type II. The former method was based on nested PCR
using primers for the amplification of the highly conserved 3’-untranslated region (3’-UTR) of the FCoV genome [19]. The latter method [8], which was based on
the spike gene region of the FCoV genome, is a multiplex-nested PCR using 2 μL of the first PCR product as
the template and nested primers [5] for discrimination
of Type I and II FCoVs. In addition, FCoV positive samples were further tested for feline panleukopenia virus
(FPLV) using a specific FPLB primer set and conditions
previously described [20] to identify possible relationships between the two viruses.
IFA detection of anti-FCoV antibody

Anti-FCoV antibody titers in feline serum samples were
determined by IFA using porcine kidney-15 (PK-15)
cells and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus
(TGEV) [19]. In brief, PK-15 cells were inoculated with
TGEV at a multiplicity of infection of 10 plaque forming
units (PFU)/cell and incubated for 8 h at 37°C. PK-15
cells were trypsinized, mixed approximately half-andhalf with uninfected cells, and seeded into wells of
eight-well glass plates (Nutacon, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Cells were incubated for 60 min at 37°C with
serial two-fold dilutions of serum samples in phosphate
buffered saline (PBS), washed three times for 5 minutes,
and incubated for 1 hour with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-feline immunoglobulin G
(KPL, Gaithersburg, MD).
Phylogenetic analysis

Korean FCoV sequences from this study and 30
sequences from global FCoV isolates obtained from
GenBank were aligned using the Clustal X 1.83
sequence alignment program [21]. Nucleotide and

Page 2 of 6

amino acid sequence identities among the Korean FCoV
isolates were calculated using BIOEDIT 7.053 [22]. The
phylogenetic tree was created by a neighbor-joining
method using MEGA 4.0 software [23].

Results
The total number of positive fecal samples for FCoV 14
cats, which were mostly Korean short hair breeds over
one year of age. Of these FCoV positive cats, three were
identified to be co-infected with FPLV (Table 1).
Among the 212 feline fecal swab samples, eight
were positive for FCoV type I, four were positive for
type II, and two were positive for types I and II
(Table 2). Eleven of the positive samples were from
cats displaying symptoms of infection. Three of the
positive samples were from asymptomatic cats (Table
2). Among the ill cats, the infections were due to type
I (n = 6), type II (n = 3) and both types I and II (n =
2). Of the three positive samples from asymptomatic
cats, two were type I and one was type II (Table 2).
Of the 107 specimens collected from six local animal
hospitals, the nine FCoV-infected cats included type I
(n = 5), type II (n = 2), and types I and II (n = 2)
(Table 1). The 105 fecal swab samples obtained from
two animal shelters included five that were FCoV
positive (three type I and two type II; co-infection
was not evident).
Alternatively, canine coronavirus (CCoV) or TGEV
can be used as a target antigen because of their close
serological identity with FCoV. The prevalence of antiFCoV antibody in the feline samples was low (29/212;
13.7%) and comprised 20-fold (n = 5), 40-fold (n = 6),
80-fold (n = 5), 160-fold (n = 3), 320-fold (n = 2), 640fold (n = 4), 1280-fold (n = 3), and 2560-fold (n = 1)
(Figure 1). The 29 cats having FCoV antibodies included
16 of the 83 ill cats (19.3%) and 13 of the 129 healthy
cats (10.1%), and, according the location of sample collection, represented animal hospital cats (14.0%, 15/107)
and shelter cats (13.3%, 14/105).
A phylogentic analysis was performed using spike gene
partial sequences from 46 CoVs including Korean FCoV
from the current study (n = 16), FCoVs obtained globally (n = 23), CCoVs (n = 5), raccoon dog CoV
(RDCoV; n = 1), and Chinese fetter badger CoV
(CFBCoV; n = 1). The phylogenetic tree data set was
resampled 1000 times to generate bootstrap percentage
values. The phylogenic tree clearly delineated types I
and II FCoVs. The analysis showed that of the ten Korean FCoVs in the type I group, nine type I FCoVs
belonged to a different lineage when compared to
strains isolated from other parts of the world, and only
the Korean FCoV 08K-1991 was grouped with UCD1
(Japan). All six Korean type II FCoVs (08K-609, 08K656, 08K-1154, 08K-1553, 08K-559/II and 08K-1429/II)

Discussion
The prevalence of type I and II FCoVs has been surveyed in many countries [3-8,16]. Similar to these other
countries, the majority of FCoV infections in Korea was
shown to be of type I (66.7%), with type II constituting
approximately 33.3%. The type I virus is more genetically diverse than type II, perhaps reflecting its global

distribution and a long period of persistence of the virus
in asymptomatic cats [5,24].
Previous studies have reported the proportion of
infected cats that are co-infected with type I and II
viruses were as high as 15.8% (6/38) in Taiwan [8] and
6.8% (5/74) in Austria [6]. In the current study, there
was no incidence of co-infection with type I and II
FCoV in healthy cats, whereas the prevalence of coinfection in ill Korean cats was somewhat higher (14.3%,
2/14) than that reported in cats from Austria. Investigation of both of the co-infected Korean cats revealed that
they dwelled in a house that also had a dog as a companion animal. This indicates that type II FCoV may have
originated from a double recombination between type I
FCoV and type II CCoV [25].
Previous research conducted in several countries has
revealed that 69-91% of seropositive cats are suspected
of having a type I infection [3,4,7]. In the present study,
although the evaluation for seroprevalence by the virus
neutralization test between types I and II FCoV could
be not performed, FCoV seroprevalence was presently
somewhat lower than the previously reported prevalences from other countries.
In a study conducted in Japan in the early 1990s, a
low prevalence of FCoV antibodies was detected in
chronically diseased cats (21.3%) and non-diseased cats
(13.4%) by IFA [3]. A more recent study in that country
that utilized PRNT reported a substantially greater
(three times) seroprevalence [16]. The latter authors
suggested that, despite the differing analysis regimens
and samples, type II FCoV infection has been decreasing
in Japanese domestic cats in recent years. Accordingly,
we anticipate that the use of the PRNT array for Korean
feline specimens would produce a higher seroprevalence
than was evident using IFA.
Phylogenic analysis of the spike gene of FCoV types
I and II clearly discriminated between the two types
(Figure 2), in agreement with previous results [8]. The
16 Korean FCoVs in our study were classified into
two serotypes, type I (n = 10) and II (n = 6) on the
neighbor joining tree which was inferred using the
Kimura 2 parameter model assuming uniform rates of
change among sites. Geographical origin or sub-lineage classification of the FCoVs was not evident due to
low nodal support value, but the perfect bootstrap
percentage on the node (CCoV C8-45) indicates that
our strains may have originated from this type II
prototype.
In this study, we examined the prevalence of Korean
cats infected with type I and II FCoV and identified the
seroprevalence of FCoV in Korean cats. Type I and II
FCoV are not highly prevalent in comparison to the prevalence of other countries. However, in recent years

Korean feline population, has been rising and it’s possible their occurrence may increase in the future.
