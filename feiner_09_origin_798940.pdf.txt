Abstract
Background: Whole genome sequences have allowed us to have an overview of the evolution of
gene repertoires. The target of the present study, the TGFβ superfamily, contains many genes
involved in vertebrate development, and provides an ideal system to explore the relationships
between evolution of gene repertoires and that of developmental programs.
Results: As a result of a bioinformatic survey of sequenced vertebrate genomes, we identified an
uncharacterized member of the TGFβ superfamily, designated bmp16, which is confined to teleost
fish species. Our molecular phylogenetic study revealed a high affinity of bmp16 to the Bmp2/4
subfamily. Importantly, further analyses based on the maximum-likelihood method unambiguously
ruled out the possibility that this teleost-specific gene is a product of teleost-specific genome
duplication. This suggests that the absence of a bmp16 ortholog in tetrapods is due to a secondary
loss. In situ hybridization showed embryonic expression of the zebrafish bmp16 in the developing
swim bladder, heart, tail bud, and ectoderm of pectoral and median fin folds in pharyngula stages,
as well as gut-associated expression in 5-day embryos.
Conclusion: Comparisons of expression patterns revealed (1) the redundancy of bmp16
expression with its homologs in presumably plesiomorphic expression domains, such as the fin fold,
heart, and tail bud, which might have permitted its loss in the tetrapod lineage, and (2) the loss of
craniofacial expression and gain of swim bladder expression of bmp16 after the gene duplication
between Bmp2, -4 and -16. Our findings highlight the importance of documenting secondary
changes of gene repertoires and expression patterns in other gene families.

Background
In the pre-genomic era, genes were identified and
sequenced in a heuristic manner to address specific biological questions. After a long period of such heuristic
exploration, many genes are now comprehensively identi-

fied as parts of genomic sequences determined in largescale projects. With several relatively well-assembled
genome sequences both for teleost fishes and tetrapods,
one might expect that we have discovered almost all genes
commonly possessed by vertebrates (see [1]). This should

be proven with care, however, especially for gene families
whose members were identified and functionally characterized intensively in the very early phase of development
of molecular biology. This caution is emphasized when
we take into account a generalized view that diverse species possess similar gene repertoires, for well-characterized gene families, such as those containing many
regulatory genes involved in animal development,
namely 'toolkit genes' ([2]; also see [3]), such as Hox genes
[4].
One of those is a group of genes containing vertebrate
bone morphogenetic proteins (bmp) 2, bmp4, and fly decapentaplegic (dpp) genes. These genes are members of the transforming growth factor (TGF) β superfamily, which encode
proteins that are cleaved to be active extracellular signaling ligands [5,6]. The TGFβ superfamily contains other
genes encoding signal proteins, such as Bmp2-15, growth
differentiation factors (GDFs), TGFβ, inhibins and
activins (note that Bmp1 [tolloid] is a protocollagen Cend peptidase that belongs to the Zinc-dependent metalloprotease family [7]). In vertebrates, Bmp2 and -4 are
involved in various developmental processes, such as
axial patterning, tissue specification and organogenesis
(e.g. [8-11]; reviewed in [12]). In particular, there are several pioneering studies that highlighted the importance of
this group of genes in understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie morphological changes during evolution (e.g. [13-17]).
In this study, we identified an uncharacterized relative of
Bmp2/4 genes that is possessed only by teleost genomes,
and designated it bmp16. Although additional gene repertoires unique to teleost fishes are often explained by the
teleost-specific genome duplication (Figure 1A), our
molecular phylogenetic analysis suggested that this gene
diverged early in vertebrate evolution and is equidistant to
both Bmp2 and -4 (Figure 1B). It should therefore be
regarded as one of the duplicates that was generated early
in vertebrate evolution, whose ortholog was lost in the
lineage leading to the amniotes. Through analyzing
expression patterns of the zebrafish bmp16 gene, we propose possible scenarios that may explain the evolution of
gene repertoires and functions.

Results
In silico identification of a novel bmp2/4 homolog in
teleost genomes
A local Blastp search using the human Bmp2 gene as a
query against downloaded available Ensembl peptide
sequences for all vertebrate species produced high similarity to a group of uncharacterized peptide sequences for teleost fishes (see Table 1, for IDs of these Ensembl entries),
which was later designated 'bmp16'. The search against
Ensembl peptide sequences didn't find any possible

ortholog to this gene for medaka, but its genome assembly contained a significantly similar unannotated
sequence on chromosome 13, at nucleotide positions
13805647-13813567 (importantly, this is neither bmp2b
nor -4). For this putative medaka bmp16 ortholog, we also
found transcript sequences, derived from embryonic
cDNA libraries, in NCBI dbEST (accession numbers,
[NCBI:AM318552] and [NCBI:DK098052]) that have
identical sequences to this genomic region and show high
similarity to bmp16 of other teleost fishes. Including
medaka, all five model teleost fish species with whole
sequenced genomes possess a single bmp16 gene. We
detected some amino acids shared only among teleost
bmp16 sequences, but overall sequences in the mature
TGFβ ligand domain, which is located at the C-terminus,
were highly conserved between bmp16 and other TGFβ
subtypes (Figure 2).
Structural properties of bmp16
By means of RT-PCR, we amplified 5' and 3' cDNA fragments of the zebrafish bmp16 (see Methods for details). By
assembling the two cDNA fragments, we obtained a contiguous cDNA sequence containing a small fraction of 5'
UTR, full protein-coding region and a full 3' UTR, which
was submitted to EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database
under the accession number [EMBL:FN400947]. In an
alignment between two predicted transcript sequences
currently available in Ensembl (ENSDART00000098425
and ENSDART00000098426) and our assembled bmp16
cDNA, we found distinct differences in nucleotide
sequences, probably due to putative mis-annotation of
exons in the Ensembl entries (data not shown).

We then aligned our cDNA with genomic DNA sequences
retrieved from Ensembl, to find out correct exon-intron
boundaries (Additional file 1: Figure S1). It turned out
that the differences between our and predicted Ensembl
transcripts originates partly from an incorrect assembly of
genomic sequences, which is verified by our PCR amplification of the corresponding genomic region (Additional
file 1: Figure S1). Our genomic sequence was also submitted to EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database under the
accession number [EMBL:FN400946].
In the deduced amino acid sequences of bmp16, it was
found that six amino acid residues, out of nine that for
human Bmp2 interact with its receptor [18], are rigidly
conserved between all teleost fishes analyzed here (Figure
2).
In silico scan for locations of the bmp16 gene in the
genomes of teleost fishes, except zebrafish, highlighted its
linkage with leucine-rich repeat containing (lrrc) 68, gemassociated protein (gemin) 7, splicing factor arginine/serinerich (sfrs) 16, reticulon (rtn) 2 and relB genes in a approxi-

of bmp16 sequences, it is not clear whether this gene was generated by the teleost-specific genome duplication (A), the tworound genome duplications early in vertebrate evolution (B), or a gene duplication event in an earlier evolutionary period (C).

A multiple alignment of amino acid sequences of Bmp2/4/16 and other members of the TGFβ superfamily. The
alignment is shown for the mature TGFβ ligand domain (SMART domain ID, SM00204). Amino acid residues conserved only
among teleost bmp16 are shown in green, while those conserved in all Bmp2/4/16 sequences are shown in red. Amino acid

mately 500-kb long genomic stretch (Additional file 2:
Figure S2). In the human genome, their orthologs were
found tightly clustered in a genomic stretch with a similar
size on chromosome 19 (Additional file 2: Figure S2).
Molecular phylogenetic analyses: in or out?
Our molecular phylogenetic analysis including the entire
TGFβ superfamily for fly, amphioxus and human, suggested a high affinity of bmp16 to Bmp2 and Bmp4 (Figure
3A). This is consistent with the observation that, in the
multiple alignment, some amino acids were exclusively
shared between bmp16 and Bmp2/4 (Figure 2). Although
this overall tree placed the bmp16 gene outside the Bmp2/
4 group (Figure 3A), a restricted phylogenetic analysis
based on the maximum-likelihood (ML) method with
Bmp2, -4, -16 and their phylogenetic neighbors provided
a robust support for placement of bmp16 inside or basal to
the bilaterian Bmp2/4 group (Figure 3B; bootstrap probability in the ML analysis, 100; Bayesian posterior probability, 1.00). In this tree, bmp16 genes cluster with teleost
bmp2a/2b genes. However, the statistical support for this
grouping is low (bootstrap probability in the ML analysis,
49). We then constructed a more focused molecular phylogeny on Bmp2, -4, and -16, with more available

sequences (Figure 4; also see additional file 3 ), including
those of non-model vertebrate species, such as the sea
lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) for which three Bmp2/4
homologues were already reported [19] (see also [16] for
their orthologs of the Japanese lamprey Lethenteron japonicum). Importantly, unlike the previous tree inferences
(Figure 3), this analysis allowed the employment of the
amino acid alignment outside the TGFβ ligand domain
that are conserved only within the Bmp2/4 subfamily (212
amino acid sites including the TGFβ ligand domain). The
ML method supported the tree topology where bmp16 is
clustering with one of the sea lamprey genes (namely
PmBmp2/4-A). In this tree, Bmp2 is more closely related to
bmp16/PmBmps than to Bmp4, but the statistical support is
not high (bootstrap probability in the ML analysis, 40;
Bayesian posterior probability, 0.75).
To assess alternative scenarios for the origin of bmp16, we
conducted an exhaustive ML analysis with seven operational taxonomic units (OTUs) (namely, bmp16, Bmp2,
Bmp4, PmBmp2/4-A, PmBmp2/4-B, PmBmp2/4-C, and outgroup; see Methods for details). Out of all 945 possible
tree topologies, eight tree topologies including the ML tree
have been revealed to be within 1σ of log-likelihood dif-

mature ligand domain highly conserved throughout the TGFβ
superfamily (62 amino acid sites) was employed in the analysis. Green, blue, red, and yellow dots indicate sequences of
fly (Drosophila melanogaster), zebrafish, human, and amphioxus (Branchiostoma floridae), respectively. Note that some
sequences of fly and amphioxus with many unique gaps were
excluded from this analysis. All available human homologs

bmp2/4 and bmp16 genes as well as anti-dorsalizing morphogenetic protein where there is no human ortholog available.

tree topologies is shown in Figure 5A. Tree topologies suggesting scenarios where all gene duplications giving rise to
Bmp2, -4 and -16 occurred after the lamprey-gnathostome
split (Figure 5B) were not supported with high statistical
confidence, nor the scenario that gene duplications giving
rise to Bmp2, -4 and -16 occurred before the lamprey-gnathostome split (Figure 5C; Table 2).

Figure 3

Gene expression analysis of bmp16
To characterize expression patterns of the zebrafish bmp16
gene, we performed in situ hybridization for embryos
spanning from 2 hours post fertilization (hpf) to 5 days
post fertilization (dpf). Expression was not detected prior
to early segmentation stages and was first clearly evident
at 18 hpf in the primordium of the median fin fold, where
expression remained detectable until 36 hpf (data not
shown). By 24 hpf, bmp16 is expressed in a region of the
tail bud mesenchyme that dorsally and caudally flanks the
midline precursor cells, i.e. the chordoneural hinge, in a
crescent shaped domain (Figure 6A). Its caudalmost
expression is in dorsal cells that form the neural keel, with
stronger expression towards the center of the neural keel
cells (Figure 6B). More anteriorly, bmp16 transcripts are
localized to the inner extremities of the cells in the neural
rod (Figure 6C). Lower levels of expression are found in
cells of the emerging midline structures [20] (Figure 6C).
bmp16 is also expressed in the developing heart, where it
was detected from 24 hpf onwards and with strong expression in both chambers at 36 hpf (Figure 6D and 6E).

order, bootstrap probabilities in the ML analysis, bootstrap probabilities in the neighbor-joining analysis, and Bayesian posterior
probabilities. See Additional file 3: Table S1 for accession IDs of the included sequences.

Between 36 and 48 hpf, bmp16 is expressed in the apical
ectodermal fold, a specialized epithelial structure homologous to the tetrapod apical ectodermal ridge (AER), of
the pectoral fins (Figure 6F and 6H). Around 36 hpf,
bmp16 also starts to be expressed in a region of the midline endoderm at the level of the anterior extent of the
pectoral fins (Figure 6H). To better characterize these cells
we compared bmp16 expression with that of the marker

for the dorsal pancreatic bud, islet-1 (isl-1; [21]), and
found that bmp16 localizes to endodermal cells at the
boundary between somites 2 and 3, while isl-1 is
expressed slightly more caudally at the somite 3-4 boundary (Figure 6H and 6I). At 52 hpf, bmp16 expression continues to align with the midline (Figure 6G), and by 72
hpf is found in an additional, more anterior patch of cells
that is associated with the foregut endoderm, whereas the

strongly expressed in the swim bladder as well as in the
gut epithelium (Figure 6K and 6L).

Discussion
Timings of gene duplications between Bmp2, -4 and -16
Since the teleost-specific genome duplication was first
proposed, many genes unique to teleost genomes have
been attributed to this event. This event per se is one of the
best systems to characterize the evolutionary impact of

whole genome duplications [4,23]. However, our finding
of the novel bmp16 genes unique to teleost genomes does
not align with this framework. All teleost genomes examined so far have a single ortholog (bmp4) to tetrapod
Bmp4, while two Bmp2 orthologs (bmp2a and -2b) are
found in the zebrafish. Notably, our molecular phylogenetic analyses did not place the bmp16 into either of Bmp2
or Bmp4 subfamilies (Figure 1B and 4). Instead, the closer
relationship of bmp16 to three lamprey Bmp2/4 homologs
was supported (Figure 5A). Based on statistical evaluation
of likelihood values, we conclude that the origin of bmp16

dates back to the earliest phase of vertebrate evolution.
Despite our additional attempt to characterize the timing
of the gene duplication by comparing gene order in the
flanking genomic regions (syntenies) between teleost
bmp16, -2, and -4, no convincing evidence for chromosomal duplications and their timings was obtained, probably because of frequent chromosomal rearrangements in
their adjacent genomic regions (data not shown). Overall,
our analysis favors the scenario that all the gene duplications giving rise to Bmp2, -4, and -16 occurred before the
cyclostome-gnathostome split. If these three subtypes are
products of the so-called two-round whole genome duplications, their timing is consistent with an emerging
hypothesis that the common ancestor of all extant vertebrates already experienced these events [24,25].
According to a previous study, the coverage of the available sea lamprey genome sequences should be sufficient
for detecting at least one exon for any given gene [26]-consistently, fragments of the previously reported three
sea lamprey Bmp2/4 homologs were detected. Additionally, our effort to survey publicly available sea lamprey
genomic and transcriptomic sequences failed to detect
additional cyclostome Bmp2/4/16 homologs. Therefore,
after our identification of bmp16, both the lamprey and
gnathostomes possess three Bmp2/4/16-related homologs.
However, the most parsimonious phylogenetic scenario
that postulates the smallest number of secondary gene
duplications and losses (Figure 5C) was significantly
rejected (Table 2). If we assume the topology of the ML
tree in Figure 4 to be correct, it suggests that only P. marinus Bmp2/4-A is the genuine ortholog of bmp16, and that
the gnathostome ortholog for P. marinus Bmp2/4-B and -C
was secondarily lost in its early evolution. Accordingly, we
should also assume that cyclostome orthologs for gnathostome Bmp2 and/or Bmp4 are unidentified or secondarily lost. In the light of low statistical support for the ML
tree, we cannot rule out other similar hypotheses (Table
2). However, with the currently available dataset and tra-

ditional framework of molecular phylogenetics, the scenario for gene duplications and retentions of duplicates
during early vertebrate evolution seems to be much more
complicated than previously reported [19]. Gene sampling for other early vertebrates will be a future task. In
particular, the group of hagfishes, which diverged from
the future lamprey lineage just after the cyclostome-gnathostome split [27], might provide information for resolving deep divergence of bmp16 from others.
Bmp2/4/16 gene repertoires: teleost fishes and tetrapods
As well as between gnathostomes and the lamprey, our
analysis has highlighted the contrast of gene repertoires
between teleosts and tetrapods. In any tetrapod species for
which whole genome sequences are available, bmp16
orthologs have not been found. The absence of this gene
in the entire taxon Tetrapoda was also confirmed by our
intensive survey of ESTs in NCBI. Judging from the maintenance of syntenic organization of genes surrounding the
bmp16 gene even in species without its ortholog (Additional file 2: Figure S2), the possible loss of this gene
doesn't seem to have involved deletion of a large genomic
portion. The most parsimonious explanation is that the
bmp16 ortholog was lost from the genome in a small-scale
event once at the basal lineage of tetrapods. A careful scan
of sarcopterygian fish genomes (namely, of lungfish and
coelacanth) could narrow the time range of the gene loss.

Another interesting observation is that even though the
zebrafish genome contains two bmp2 orthologs (namely
bmp2a and -2b), other model teleost fishes categorized in
Acanthomorpha seem to possess only one, namely bmp2b
(Figure 4). Our additional survey in all available EST
sequences for Acanthomorpha did not detect any more
unidentified bmp2 relative. This suggests that bmp2a is
confined to at least some of species in Otocephala (e.g.
zebrafish, Mexican cavefish), and the bmp2a ortholog was
secondarily lost in the lineage leading to Acanthomorpha.
This line of evidence for gene losses underlines an impor-

tance of elaborate comparisons of gene repertoires even
between relatively closely related animals. It is likely that
more 'toolkit' genes involved in vertebrate development,
which are normally considered to be present universally
in all relevant genomes, are revealed to have experienced
this type of evolutionary change, as shown in some previous studies (e.g. [28]).
Roles of bmp16 during zebrafish embryogenesis: did
redundancy permit the loss?
In contrast to the divergent nature of bmp16 from other
Bmp2/4 members, the deduced amino acid sequences of
bmp16 genes seem to be relatively conserved among teleosts, especially within Acanthomorpha (Figure 2). We
confirmed transcription of this uncharacterized gene in
zebrafish with RT-PCR and in situ hybridization, and in
medaka with a survey of publicly available ESTs. These
data, together with the conservation of the majority of
amino acid residues that are crucial for recognition by the
BMP type I receptor [18], suggest that bmp16 functions as
an active ligand in the TGFβ signaling pathway in particular biological processes.

Our analysis revealed bmp16 expressions in several different tissues and cell types during zebrafish embryogenesis,
some of which are known to express other members of the
TGFβ superfamily in tetrapods. In light of our molecular
phylogenetic evidence of the loss of the bmp16 ortholog in
the tetrapod lineage, one can ask whether its original functions might have been taken over by other members of the
TGFβ superfamily in the tetrapods.
This assumption holds true for pectoral fins, because in
addition to bmp2b and bmp4 [29-31], several other bmp
genes (e.g. bmp6, bmp7b [32,33]) are co-expressed in the
zebrafish apical ectodermal fold. In addition, expression
of bmp2a, bmp2b, bmp4 and bmp7 is up-regulated in the
epithelium of the developing caudal fin fold [29-32]. The
AER of tetrapod limbs also expresses a number of Bmp
genes (reviewed in [34]). Therefore, individual Bmp subtypes are likely to act in a redundant fashion. The loss of
the bmp16 ortholog in the tetrapod ancestor might have
been compensated in the developing specialized epithelia
of median fins and paired appendages by a redundancy of
Bmp gene function in these tissues.
Similarly, bmp2b and bmp4, as well as bmp16, are commonly expressed in the developing zebrafish heart [3537]. Possible deleterious effects associated with the loss of
the bmp16 ortholog in the tetrapod lineage could eventually have been compensated by the expression of Bmp2
and Bmp4, and the recruitment of additional homologs
along with the evolution of an advanced chambering system. Accordingly, tetrapods not only express Bmp2 and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/277

Bmp4 during heart development, but also Bmp5 and Bmp7
[9,10,38,39].
Because the swim bladder and mammalian lungs share a
common evolutionary origin [40], it is likely that their
development is controlled by shared regulatory pathways.
In the mouse, Bmp4 is expressed during lung development
where it is initially found at high levels in the lung buds,
followed by expression in the distal epithelial tips and
with lower levels in the adjacent mesenchyme [41]. Bmp4
promotes the development of distal epithelial cell types at
the expense of proximal cell types [42,43]. Accordingly,
the proximal lung epithelium expresses the Bmp4 antagonist, Gremlin1, which determines proximal lung epithelial
cell fate through inhibition of Bmp signaling. By regulating the proliferation, survival and morphogenetic activity
of distal lung epithelial cells, Bmp signaling plays an
essential role in lung morphogenesis [41,42,44-49].
In zebrafish, it has been shown that signaling through
Bmp2a/2b regulates the decision between hepatic versus
pancreatic fate in the endodermal midline [50,51]. Bmp
signaling in adjacent lateral plate mesodermal tissues patterns the endoderm through direct contact, as disruption
of coordinated cell movements between these tissues
causes patterning defects in the endoderm and ceased proliferation and apoptosis of cells in the liver primordium
that results from a failure of bmp2a expressing cells to
properly contact the endoderm [51].
Comparably little is known about the roles of Bmps during swim bladder development. However, in the
zebrafish, the swim bladder expresses the protein related to
Dan and Cerberus (prdc) gene (alias: gremlin2; [52]), which
encodes an antagonist of signaling through bmp2a/2b and
bmp4 [53]. It will therefore be interesting to see whether
bmp16 and prdc play comparable antagonistic roles during
swim bladder development like Bmp4/Gremlin1 in the
mouse lung.
Interestingly, we observed bmp16 expression in the tail
bud between 24 and 36 hpf. Although bmp2a and bmp4
are transiently expressed in a broad domain of the caudal
trunk-forming mesoderm after the end of gastrulation
[30], neither gene is expressed at late stages of somitogenesis. Due to its dynamic expression in the developing neural keel, it is possible that bmp16 plays a role during the
ongoing neurulation process in the tail, a process that
probably also involves bmp7a [54]. Its expression in the
zebrafish tail may correspond to that in the apical surface
of the neural tube in tetrapods. In the mouse embryo,
Bmp2 together with Bmp7, are expressed in the surface
ectoderm overlying the neural folds [55]. Faure et al.
showed that Smad-1, which transduces Bmp signaling, is
activated in cells of the opened neural tube as well as in

Page 10 of 14

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:277

the ectodermal cells covering the neural folds in 10-day
mouse embryos, i.e. during neurulation of the trunk
region [56]. These observations support the idea that
bmp16 in teleosts and Bmp2 and -7 in the mouse may serve
similar functions during tail neurulation. Interestingly,
the zebrafish bmp16 is expressed in partially overlapping
domains with notch1b and notch5 in the tail bud mesenchyme that forms the neural rod during segmentation
stages [57]. It has been shown that ectopic expression of
Bmp4 in the Xenopus tail bud leads to the formation of an
extra tail-like outgrowth [58]. The formation of a neural
tube in this structure is Notch signaling-dependent [58]. It
will therefore be of interest to define the possible genetic
interactions that might exist between these signaling pathways during caudal neural keel development in the
zebrafish.
Shuffling of expression domains among Bmp2/4/16 genes
The bmp16 expression patterns, scrutinized above from
the developmental point of view, can also be dissected
from the phylogenetic point of view to shed light on how
embryonic expressions for this group of genes have been
shuffled during vertebrate evolution. As for the swim
bladder-associated expression of bmp16 (Figure 6G, H and
6J-L), our observation is the first evidence of involvement
of a member of the TGFβ superfamily in its development.
While neither zebrafish bmp2a/2b nor bmp4 are currently
known to be expressed in the developing swim bladder
[33], a focused analysis on their expression patterns in the
developing endoderm at the time of swim bladder formation might be required to determine whether or not one
of these genes is involved in this process. This should
reveal whether other members of the bmp2/4/16 subfamily that duplicated prior to the evolution of the swim
bladder were recruited for its development. Nonetheless,
as described above, mouse Bmp4 is expressed in the developing lung, which is a homologous structure to the swim
bladder [41]. So far, there is no report of lung-associated
expression for Bmp2 or -4 genes in non-mammalian vertebrates. Although this might be a result of recent lineagespecific recruitment of paralogous genes in the morphogenesis of homologous structures, this endodermal
expression might have already been possessed by the
ancestral gene before the split of Bmp4 and bmp16 genes.

In contrast, Bmp2 and -4 expression in fin/limb buds,
heart and tail bud, where zebrafish bmp16 is expressed
(Figure 6), are found in a more taxonomically broad set of
vertebrates (see [34] for limb bud expressions for various
vertebrates). It is highly likely that bmp16 expression in
those tissues was inherited from the ancestral Bmp2/4/16
gene, with some lineage-specific exceptions in which
some expression domains are absent (e.g. absence of tail
bud expression for zebrafish bmp4).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/277

On the other hand, zebrafish bmp16 expression is absent
in many of the tissues where Bmp2 and/or -4 are frequently expressed, such as in the central nervous system,
otic vesicle, olfactory placode, neural crest-derived
ectomesenchyme (Figure 6). Moreover, the zebrafish
bmp16 was not expressed in pre-gastrulation stages in
which Bmp2 and -4 are expressed in the ventral mesoderm
to regulate dorsoventral axis specification [59]. This
implies that after the gene duplication between Bmp2, -4
and -16, bmp16 expression was secondarily lost in those
tissues, and was instead recruited for swim bladder development.
Even though in the molecular phylogenetic trees bmp16 is
placed more closely to sea lamprey Bmp2/4 homologs
than to jawed-vertebrate Bmp2/4 (Figure 4), a direct comparison of expression patterns between them shows that
the only expression domain they have in common is the
heart (between bmp16 and PmBmp2/4A) [19]. In addition
to the heart, PmBmp2/4A is expressed in a wide variety of
tissues where Bmp2/4 expression is usually observed in
bony vertebrates, while PmBmp2/4B and -C expression is
restricted to branchial arches [19]. In exploring the evolutionary history of Bmp2/4/16 expression patterns, this
deviation in expression patterns of the sea lamprey
homologs prevents us from drawing a clear-cut scenario-it would not be so surprising if early-branching lineages
have accumulated a considerable number of secondary
changes (see [60] for an example of cyclostome lineagespecific changes in gene order; see also [24] for a review).
Information for missing early-branching lineages (e.g.
chondrichthyes) might provide more clues about whether
the variety of expression patterns originates from (1) frequent lineage-specific losses of expression domains from
an ancestral template with a full set of domains, or (2)
independent gains of similar expression domains in different lineages.

Conclusion
Our scan in a public genome database identified a novel
Bmp2/4 relative, bmp16, confined to teleost fish genomes.
We suggest that this gene duplicated from Bmp2 and -4
early in vertebrate evolution, and that the absence of the
tetrapod ortholog is due to the secondary loss in its basal
lineage. This loss might have been permitted by the
redundant expression patterns shared with other Bmp subtypes in fin folds, heart, and tail bud, seen in the zebrafish.
At the same time, this gene was revealed to be expressed
in the swim bladder, which so far has not been shown to
express any other Bmp homolog. Our study demonstrates
the power of bioinformatic, phylogenetic approaches to
newly identify unexplored genes responsible for crucial
biological processes. In particular, an importance of making a similar type of efforts for other gene families to doc-

ument unidentified genes and secondary changes of their
expression patterns is underlined.

Methods
Retrieval of sequences
Sequences for members of the TGFβ superfamily were
retrieved from the Ensembl genome database (version 53;
[61]) and NCBI Protein database, by running Blastp [62]
using mammalian Bmp2 peptide sequences as queries. In
parallel, peptide sequences of Branchiostoma floridae were
also downloaded from Joint Genome institute (JGI; http:/
/genome.jgi-psf.org/Brafl1/Brafl1.download.ftp.html),
and used as a target of a Blastp search. An optimal multiple alignment of the retrieved amino acid sequences and
those sequenced in this study was constructed using the
alignment editor XCED, in which the MAFFT program is
implemented [63].
Molecular phylogenetic analysis
Molecular phylogenetic trees were inferred using the
regions that were unambiguously aligned with no gaps.
The neighbor-joining tree reconstruction [64] was processed using XCED. To calculate the support values for the
molecular phylogenetic tree shown in Figures 3 and 4, we
used PhyML [65] and MrBayes 3.1 [66]. Bootstrap probabilities were obtained with 100 resamplings. To investigate the phylogenetic relationship between Bmp2/4/16
and P. marinus genes (Table 2), the maximum-likelihood
(ML) tree was inferred using Tree-Puzzle [67], assuming
JTT+I+Γ4 model (shape parameter of the gamma distribution α = 0.47). In this ML analysis, we performed an
exhaustive search of the ML tree in the 'user defined trees'
mode of Tree-Puzzle with all 945 possible topologies consisting of seven OTUs, namely, gnathostome Bmp2, gnathostome Bmp4, teleost bmp16, P. marinus PmBmp2/4-A, P.
marinus PmBmp2/4-B, P. marinus PmBmp2/4-C and outgroup. Phylogenetic relationships within individual OTUs
were constrained according to generally accepted phylogenetic relationships of relevant species. Statistical tests for
evaluation of alternative tree topologies were performed
using CONSEL [68].

5'-end of the bmp16 cDNA, we designed the reverse primer
5'-CCTCCTGGTCCAGAAAGAGT-3' based on the aforementioned 3'-end cDNA sequence, while the forward
primer
5'-CTCCCGTTATTCCAGAGATCCA-3'
was
designed based on expressed sequence tags (ESTs) in
NCBI dbEST (accession numbers [NCBI:CK709830],
[NCBI:AW421680] and [NCBI:AW305992]) containing
the 5' UTR of this gene. The assembled zebrafish bmp16
cDNA sequence is deposited in EMBL Nucleotide
Sequence Database under the accession number
[EMBL:FN400947].
Genomic DNA was extracted from 24 hpf embryos.
Sequence specific primers designed based on the cDNA
sequence of zebrafish bmp16 we obtained as above were
used to amplify a 527-bp fragment containing a region
where we found an incorrect assembly of genomic
sequences in Ensembl (zebrafish genome assemblies, version Zv7 and Zv8) (see Additional file 1: Figure S1). This
partial genomic sequence for the zebrafish bmp16 is
deposited in EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database under
the accession number [EMBL:FN400947].
In situ hybridization
The bmp16 riboprobes were prepared using the two cDNA
fragments (5'- and 3'- fragments) amplified as above,
between which we confirmed positive expression signals
observed in common. In Figure 6, only results of in situ
hybridization using the 3' probe are shown. isl-1 probe
synthesis employed the cDNA template previously
reported [69]. Whole mount in situ hybridization was performed as previously described [70], using the riboprobes
labeled with digoxigenin-UTP (Roche Applied Science).
Hybridization was detected with alkaline phosphate-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody followed by incubation
with NBT (nitroblue tetrazolium) and BCIP (5-bromo- 4chloro-3-indolyl phosphate). Stained embryos were
examined with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope. Images were
processed using Zeiss Axiovision and Adobe Photoshop
software.

Authors' contributions
PCR
Total RNA was extracted from a whole 52 hpf zebrafish
embryo. This RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA
using SuperScript III (Invitrogen) following the instruction of 3'RACE System (Invitrogen). This cDNA was used
as a template for PCR with sequence specific primers
designed based on the zebrafish bmp16 transcript
sequence
found
in
Ensembl
(ID:
ENSDART00000098426). The first 3'RACE PCR was performed using the forward primer 5'-CAAGAACTGTGTTGTTTCAGCTC-3', and the product of this PCR was used as
a template of the nested PCR reaction with forward primer
5'-GCTAGTCAGCTCTGTAAACGGA-3'. In amplifying the

SK identified bmp16 and performed molecular phylogenetic analyses. NF analyzed gene structure of zebrafish
bmp16 and performed an analysis on its gene expression
patterns. GB and AJR provided practical instructions
about in situ hybridization. GB and SK wrote the first draft
of the manuscript. All authors contributed to the writing
of the final version of the manuscript.
