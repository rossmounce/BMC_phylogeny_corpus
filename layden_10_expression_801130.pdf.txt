Expression and phylogenetic analysis of the zic
gene family in the evolution and development of
metazoans
Michael J Layden, Néva P Meyer, Kevin Pang, Elaine C Seaver, Mark Q Martindale*

Abstract
Background: zic genes are members of the gli/glis/nkl/zic super-family of C2H2 zinc finger (ZF) transcription factors.
Homologs of the zic family have been implicated in patterning neural and mesodermal tissues in bilaterians. Prior
to this study, the origin of the metazoan zic gene family was unknown and expression of zic gene homologs
during the development of early branching metazoans had not been investigated.
Results: Phylogenetic analyses of novel zic candidate genes identified a definitive zic homolog in the placozoan
Trichoplax adhaerens, two gli/glis/nkl-like genes in the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi, confirmed the presence of
three gli/glis/nkl-like genes in Porifera, and confirmed the five previously identified zic genes in the cnidarian
Nematostella vectensis. In the cnidarian N. vectensis, zic homologs are expressed in ectoderm and the gastrodermis
(a bifunctional endomesoderm), in presumptive and developing tentacles, and in oral and sensory apical tuft
ectoderm. The Capitella teleta zic homolog (Ct-zic) is detectable in a subset of the developing nervous system, the
foregut, and the mesoderm associated with the segmentally repeated chaetae. Lastly, expression of gli and glis
homologs in Mnemiopsis. leidyi is detected exclusively in neural cells in floor of the apical organ.
Conclusions: Based on our analyses, we propose that the zic gene family arose in the common ancestor of the
Placozoa, Cnidaria and Bilateria from a gli/glis/nkl-like gene and that both ZOC and ZF-NC domains evolved prior to
cnidarian-bilaterian divergence. We also conclude that zic expression in neural ectoderm and developing neurons
is pervasive throughout the Metazoa and likely evolved from neural expression of an ancestral gli/glis/nkl/zic gene.
zic expression in bilaterian mesoderm may be related to the expression in the gastrodermis of a cnidarianbilaterian common ancestor.

Background
The zic genes form a sub-family of the gli/glis/nkl/zic
transcription factor super-family, which is characterized
by the presence of five tandem C2H2 zinc finger (ZF)
DNA binding domains [1-3]. Two key features distinguish the Zic sub-family proteins from the Gli, Glis and
Nkl sub-family proteins. Most notably, the number of
amino acids between the two cysteine residues in the first
C2H2 zinc finger is increased (Additional File 1) [1]. Secondly, many zic genes contain two additional domains
positioned N-terminal to the ZF domains, the Zic1-3
odd-paired conserved (ZOC) domain and the ZF-NC
domain (Figure 1A-C) [1-4]. Function has been assigned

Hawaii, Manoa, 41 Ahui St Honolulu, HI 96813, USA

to the ZOC domain [4], while the ZF-NC domain has
only been identified by sequence conservation.
Bilaterian and cnidarian zic genes likely arose from a single ancestral gene that radiated independently in both
lineages. All characterized bilaterian zic genes contain a
conserved intron between the third and fourth ZF
domains that is not present elsewhere in the metazoans
[1]. Lineage specific zic gene radiation and 100% conservation of this common intron in all bilaterian zics support
a single urbilaterian zic gene. Furthermore, in the basal
deuterostome echinoderm Strongylocentrotus purpuratus
and in most protostome lineages only a single zic gene
has been identified [1]. An exception is the platyhelminthes lineage, which has been shown to possess two
zic paralogs (see DjaZicA, B Figure 2) [1]. zic gene number expanded via tandem and chromosomal duplication

in the chordate lineage from a single ancestral gene in the
basal cephalochordate to two in urochordates and five in
vertebrates [1-3].
The cnidarians are the only basal metazoan known to
possess zic gene homologs. A single zic gene was identified in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) surveys of
Hydra vulgaris [5] and the jellyfish Scolionema suvaense
[1]. Nematostella vectensis possesses five zic genes, of
which four are arranged tandemly on the same genomic
scaffold [1], suggesting tandem duplication from a single
ancestral gene [1]. Recent sequencing of the Amphimedon queenslandica sponge genome identified one putative ancestral gli/glis/nkl gene, one glis-like gene and
one gli-like gene [6]. However, no zic homolog was
identified [6]. zic homologs have not been verified in
placozoans and ctenophores.
Expression of zic homologs during bilaterian development suggests that the urbilaterian zic gene was
expressed in neural and mesodermal domains. zic
expression in protostomes (Ecdysozoa and Lophotrochozoa) has been characterized in Drosophila melanogaster,
Caenorhabditis elegans and Tubifex tubifex. The fruit fly
D. melanogaster zic (odd-paired; opa) is expressed in all
ectodermal and mesodermal precursors in the presumptive segmented region of the embryo [7,8]. At later
stages opa is expressed in the neural ectoderm [9] and
in a subset of visceral mesoderm around the midgut [8].
In the nematode C. elegans, the zic homolog, ref-2, is
expressed in a subset of neural precursors [10,11]. In
the lophotrochozoan oligochaete T. tubifex, Ttuzic
expression is observed in the mesodermal m-blast cells
and germ bands, mesoderm associated with chaetal sacs,
anterior ectoderm and the developing brain [12]. In
summary, protostome zic genes are expressed in a subset of neural-ectoderm and a sub-set of mesoderm.
However, the structures expressing zic within a particular germ layer vary between species (subset of mesodermal precursors in T. tubifex versus broad mesodermal
precursor in D. melanogaster). Moreover, expression
even within similar tissues (for example, neural) varies
in both timing and location (anterior brain in T. tubifex
versus ventral nerve cord (VNC) in D. melanogaster).
In deuterostomes, zic expression and function have
been best characterized in the chordate lineage. The five
vertebrate zic gene expression patterns show extensive
overlap during development. In the mouse, zebrafish
and Xenopus embryos, zic is expressed in presumptive
ectoderm at or just prior to gastrulation [13]. The ectodermal expression resolves to the neural plate and is
ultimately restricted to the dorsal neural tube and the
lateral boundary of the neural plate where neural crest
cells will form [2,3]. In addition, vertebrate zic genes are
expressed in the dorsal somitic mesoderm and
MmuZic1 and MmuZic3 are expressed in the developing

Page 4 of 16

retina [13]. In ascidians, two zic genes have been identified (macho-1 and zicL/N), which display similar patterns among the three species examined [14-18]. zicL/N
is expressed in presumptive muscle and notochord
mesodermal lineages and in neural precursors [14-16].
macho-1 mRNA is localized to mesodermal precursor
blastomeres [17,18]. The amphioxus zic gene (amphizic)
is detected in the dorsal ectoderm and underlying mesoderm in gastrula, in the mesodermally-derived roof of
the anterior archenteron, in the dorsal neural tube and
in dorsal-lateral somatic mesoderm in the developing
somites [14].
Previously, the only zic gene expression pattern to be
characterized in early branching metazoans was in the
cnidarian H. vulgaris. In these animals zic (hyzic)
expression is detected in adult polyps within the dividing i-cells [5], which are stem cells that generate cnidocytes, neurons and other cell types [5]. However,
embryonic expression of zic gene homologs has yet to
be characterized in cnidarians.
In order to better understand the diverse roles of zic
genes and their potential role in the evolution and development of metazoans, we have investigated the origins
and expression of the zic gene family in a diverse group
of previously unsampled metazoans. Our findings indicate that the zic gene family probably arose from a gli/
glis/nkl-like precursor gene in the common ancestor of
Placozoa/Cnidaria/Bilateria, as supported by a definitive
zic ortholog in the Trichoplax adhaerens genome and a
lack of zic homologs in either of the more basally branching Ctenophora or Porifera. Additionally, we present
expression patterns for zic genes during the development
of the cnidarian N. vectensis, the lophotrochozoan C. teleta and for gli and glis genes in the ctenophore M. leidyi.

Results
Zic genes evolved prior to the split between Placozoa
and Cnidaria

We identified putative zic homologs in early branching
metazoans by degenerate PCR and genome searches (see
Materials and Methods for details). We searched poriferan, ctenophore, and placozoan genomes because no
zic sequences had been verified in these metazoan
clades. In addition, we searched known fungal genomes
and choanoflagellate genomes using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) approaches. In order to
identify putative gli/glis/nkl/zic genes, sequences were
aligned to previously characterized gli/glis/nkl/zic genes
(see Table 1 for a list of genes and species; Additional
File 1 for alignment) and the presence of the five tandem ZF domains was determined. Our search yielded
novel candidate gli/glis/nkl/zic genes in T. adhaerens
(three genes), N. vectensis (two), M. leidyi (two), C. teleta (three) and C. longifissura (one). However, we were

only able to obtain an N-terminal region containing the
ZOC, ZF-NC, and the first 2 ZF domains in a putative
zic from the acoel Convolutriloba longifissura (Clozic) by
rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) PCR (Additional File 1). No choanoflagellete gli/glis/nkl/zic candidate genes were identified in blast searches (data not
shown).
Phylogenetic relationships among candidate genes were
determined by performing Bayesian [19] and Maximum
Likelihood [20] (Figure 2) analyses using sequences
beginning with the first cysteine residue of the first ZF
domain (ZF1) through the last histidine residue in the
fifth ZF domain (ZF5) (Additional File 1). Our analyses
confirmed previously identified cnidarian zic genes
(NvzicA-E) [1] and suggested that the two novel Nematostella candidate genes were not zic genes but, rather,
were members of the glis and nkl clades. Bayesian and
Maximum Likelihood analyses grouped NvGlis with the
Glis family (Bayesian posterior probability (PP) = 97,
Maximum Likelihood bootstrap value (BS) = 0.75; Figure
2), and grouped NvNkl with the Nkl family (PP = 1, BS =
0.99; Figure 2). Two of the three placozoan T. adhaerens
candidate genes failed to group within the gli/glis/nkl/zic
superfamily (see Tad1.1.1692.1 and Tad1.40.97.1; Figure
2), but reciprocal BLAST searches suggested that they
were related to ZF143 genes rather than members of the
gli/glis/nkl/zic gene family. This is supported by phylogenetic analysis for Tad1.1.1692.1 (PP = 1, BS = 0.96; Figure
2). Tad1.40.97.1 groups strongly with the ZF143 (PP = 1,
BS = 0.99; Figure 2) genes rather than the gli/glis/nkl/zic
genes suggesting that it is also not a gli/glis/nkl/zic
related gene. However the third T. adhaerens gene,
Tadzic, grouped within the zic gene sub-family with
strong support (PP = 1, BS = 0.99; Figure 2). In the polychaete C. teleta, phylogenetic analyses strongly support
the assignment of the three candidate genes, Ct-zic, Ctgli and Ct-glis, into the zic, gli and glis sub-families,
respectively (PP = 1, 1, 0.97 and BS = 0.99, 0.79 and 0.75,
respectively; Figure 2). In addition, we cloned a partial
sequence out of the acoel C. longifissura, Clozic, which
grouped within the zic sub-family (PP = 1, BS = 0.97; Figure 2). The identification of Tadzic in Placozoa is the
putative earliest metazoan zic ortholog identified to date.
We conclude that zic genes were present in the common
ancestor of Placozoa and later branching metazoans.

Two gli/glis/nkl/zic sequences were identified in M.
leidyi despite extensive searches of the M. leidyi
sequenced genome (50X sequence coverage, Ryan et al.,
manuscript in preparation). One M. leidyi sequence,
Mlglis, grouped with the glis sub-family (PP = 0.97, BS
= 0.75; Figure 2). The second M. leidyi sequence, Mlgli,
grouped with the gli sub-family (PP = 1, BS = 0.79; Figure 2). However, this grouping is based on the presence
of only four of the five ZF domains, ZF2-ZF5 (Additional File 1). Attempts to identify the ZF1 domain via
RACE PCR and sequence predictions were unsuccessful
(data not shown). Thus, we cannot confirm that Mlgli
contains all five ZFs. However, because it groups so
strongly with the gli sub-family, we included it in our
analysis. We confirmed the reported orthology of the
three previously described A. queenslandica sequences.
We identified an ancestral/sister gli/glis/nkl sequence
(Amqgli2/3b, PP = 0.99, BS = 0.82; Figure 2), one glilike sequence (Amqgli2/3a, PP = 1, BS = 0.79), and one
glis-like sequences (Amqglis1/3, PP = 0.95, BS = 0.65).
Examination of the spacing between the cysteine residues in the ZF1 peptide sequence is also consistent with
Mlglis, Amqgli2/3a, Amqgli2/3b and Amqglis1/3
sequences being more closely related to the gli/glis/nkl
sub-families than the zic gene sub-family (Additional
File 1). Degenerate PCR in a second sponge species
(Ephydatia muelleri) failed to identify a poriferan zic
sequence (data not shown). We conclude that no definitive zic ortholog exists in the ctenophore or poriferan
animals analysed, but that both groups contain gli/glis/
nkl-like homologs in their genomes.
Clozic and Ct-zic, but not Tadzic, contain ZF-NC domains

As previous studies [1] have suggested that zic genes,
but not gli or glis genes, contain a ZF-NC domain, we
attempted to identify ZF-NC domains in the newly
described zic genes Tadzic, Ct-zic and Clozic as well as
in the gli/glis/nkl genes. We identified no ZF-NC or
ZOC domains outside of the zic homologs. The ZF-NC
domain is located immediately N-terminal to the ZF1
domain, so we aligned all the sequences N-terminal to
the ZF1 domains to identify candidate ZF-NC domains.
We identified clear ZF-NC domains in CloZic, Ct-Zic
and a partially conserved ZF-NC in TadZic (Figure 1B).
The ZF-NC consensus sequence has been previously

Layden et al. EvoDevo 2010, 1:12
http://www.evodevojournal.com/content/1/1/12

described as GAF(F/L)RYMRQP-(0-7AA)-IKQE [1].
Ct-Zic and CloZic each have 87% and 93% conserved
similarity with this consensus sequence across their
respective ZF-NC domains (Figure 1B). However, the
TadZic sequence is poorly conserved except for the presence of the four C-terminal amino acids, a conserved
proline (Figure 1B), and a conservative arginine to histidine change at position 5 (Figure 1B). While CloZic and
Ct-Zic contain definitive ZF-NC domains, it is not clear
if the TadZic sequence represents a functional ZF-NC
domain.
A single zic ortholog containing a ZOC domain was
shared by Cnidaria and Bilateria

Using non-biased alignment of the N-terminal portions
of all Zic proteins assayed, we identified a conserved
RDFL-(1-2AA)-RR ZOC consensus sequence. The ZOC
domain previously described consensus sequence was
(S/T)RDFLxxxR [1,4]. However, our alignment suggests
that the RDFL-(1-2AA)-RR consensus sequence is more
prevalent throughout the metazoans than the previously
described consensus. Using the novel consensus
sequence, we identified a ZOC domain in NvZicA,C,D,
E, Ct-Zic, and CloZic (Figure 1C). The NvZicA ZOC
sequence is 100% identical to the new ZOC consensus
sequence. This is particularly important, because ZOC
domains have not been previously described in cnidarians [1]. Our finding pushes back the emergence of the
ZOC domain to at least the cnidarian-bilaterian common ancestor. The NvzicC-E genes possess more weakly
conserved putative ZOC domains. However, in the case
of NvzicD, the amino acid content of the domain
HDYIHH, is 100% similar to the RDFL-RR sequence
(Figure 1C), suggesting that the NvzicD ZOC domain
may still be functional. Altering the definition of the
ZOC domain results in the inclusion of a number of
additional genes and taxa into the ZOC possessing zic
group. They are the cnidarians (see NvzicA,C,D,E; Figure
1C), the vertebrate Zic4 and Zic5 sequences (see
MmuZic5, XlaZic4; Figure 1C), nematodes (see CelRef2;
Figure 1C), platyhelminthes (see DjaZicA; Figure 1C)
and urochodates (see amphiZic; Figure 1C). We did not
find a ZOC-like sequence for TadZic. However, due to
sequence and annotation errors, it is possible that we
have not identified a full length N-terminal sequence
and, thus, a ZOC-like domain may be encoded in the
full Tadzic coding sequence. Using sequence similarity,
it appears that putative ZOC domains can be identified
in cnidarians, acoels, platyhelminthes, nematodes, annelids, vertebrates, insects and urochordates (Figure 1C).
Thus, the earliest described ZOC sequence appears to
have arisen in the cnidarian-bilaterian ancestor, rather
than the urbilaterian ancestor.

NvzicA and NvzicB appear to be expressed at very low
levels, as we were unable to obtain reproducible expression for both genes, although they are detected by RTPCR in 24, 48 and 72 hours post fertilization hpf cDNA
samples suggesting that they are expressed at low levels
beginning just after gastrulation and maintain expression
into at least the planula larval stages (data not shown).
NvzicC-E genes all share similar expression patterns.
NvzicC and NvzicD expression is first detectable in the
presumptive tentacle ectoderm surrounding the mouth
in planula larva (Figure 3B and 3G respectively). There
are five notable differences between NvzicC and NvzicD
expression patterns. First, NvzicD ectodermal expression
is detected only in the presumptive tentacle domains
(Figure 3G) and not in the intervening intertentacular
ectodermal domains (compare Figure 3G and 3H with
3B and 3C), while NvzicC is expressed in a ring encompassing both the presumptive tentacle and intertentacular domains (Figure 3B, C and 3Q). In addition to
NvzicC ectodermal expression, there might also be
expression in the underlying endoderm. The second difference is that, by late planula stages, NvzicD expression
is down regulated in the presumptive tentacle region
(Figure 3H), while NvzicC expression remains robust
throughout planula and tentacle bud stages (Figures 3BD). Interestingly, NvzicD expression is up regulated
again in the forming and early tentacles of the bud and
juvenile polyp stages (Figure 3I and 3J). The third difference is that NvzicD expression in the juvenile polyp is
detectable in distinct endodermal cells or groups of cells
in the tentacles (Figure 3J and 3P), while NvzicC is
detectable an ectodermal stripe in the proximal tentacle
region (Figure 3E). It is currently unclear which cell
types are expressing NvzicD. The fourth difference is
that NvzicD can be observed in individual cells in the
polyp body wall ectoderm (Figure 3G and 3S; arrowheads). Lastly, NvzicD expression is detectable in distinct
cell populations in the endodermal component of the
developing mesenteries (Figure 3T; closed arrow) and
endoderm surrounding the pharyngeal ectoderm (Figure
3T; open arrow), while NvzicC is not.
NvzicE expression is first detected during embryonic
stages, which is earlier than either NvzicC or NvzicD. It is
weakly expressed throughout the embryonic ectoderm
shortly after gastrulation (Figure 3K). At planula stages,
weak ubiquitous expression of NvzicE is detected throughout the ectoderm but enrichment is observed in oral ectoderm and presumptive tentacle bud domain and at the
aboral pole in the apical tuft (Figure 3L; arrow and

Layden et al. EvoDevo 2010, 1:12
http://www.evodevojournal.com/content/1/1/12

arrowhead, respectively). By late planula stages NvzicE
expression is down regulated in the body wall ectoderm
but remains detectable in the apical tuft ectoderm (Figure
3M; arrow) and the presumptive tentacle domain (Figure
3M). By the tentacle bud stage, aboral expression of
NvzicE is no longer detectable (Figure 3N), due to the loss
of the apical tuft after settlement. However, expression

Page 8 of 16

persists in tentacle endoderm (Figure 3O) and, occasionally, single NvzicE-positive cells appear in the tentacle
ectoderm in juvenile polyps (Figure 3R). In summary,
NvzicC-E display similar expression patterns in the developing tentacle endoderm and ectoderm, the endodermal
component of the mesenteries and in the oral ectoderm.
In addition, NvzicE is expressed in the apical tuft ectoderm

oral to the left except Q, which is an oral view with mouth indicated by an asterisk. The endoderm is indicated by en, ectoderm by ec,

C and D) but not in oral ectoderm (Q) in planula stages. The polyp NvzicC expression is in the tentacle ectoderm proximal to the polyp body,
but not in distal regions (E). NvzicD is expressed in the presumptive tentacle ectoderm (G and H) and individual ectodermal cells (G, arrowhead)
of the planula. NvzicD is also expressed in tentacle buds (I), tentacular endoderm (J and P), pharangeal endoderm (T, open arrow) and in distinct
cells in the endodermal component of the directive mesentaries (T, closed arrow) in the polyps. The polyp NvzicD expression is occasionally
observed in the endodermal cells (T. arrowhead) and the ectodermal cells (S, arrowheads) of the polyp. NvzicE expression is expressed in the
aboral pole of the gastrula embryo (K, arrow). NvzicE is expressed n the oral ectoderm (L, arrow), presumptive tentacle (L and M) and the apical
tuft (M, arrow) the planula and tentacle buds (N), tentacle endoderm (O) and occasional individual ectodermal cells in the tentacles (R,

of the late embryonic stages and in individual cells

Ct-zic expression during development of the bilaterian
lophotrochozoan C. teleta

Prior to this study zic gene expression had only been
investigated in a single lophotrochozoan, the oligochaete
T. tubifex. Most protostome zic expression has been
described in the ecdysozoans. Thus, investigating additional lophotrochozoan animals will provide a more
complete comparison for understanding the relationship
among bilaterian zic gene expression patterns.
Ct-zic expression in C. teleta is first detected during
cleavage stages in a subset of micromeres at the animal
hemisphere of the blastula (Figure 4M). Ct-zic is not
detectable in endodermal vegetal macromeres at any
stage examined. At later stages, during tissue morphogenesis (stages 3 - 9), Ct-zic transcript is detected in the
neural ectoderm and mesodermal cell types. Neural
ectoderm expression begins at stage 3 in bilaterally symmetric subsets of the anterior neural ectoderm (Figure
4B; arrow), which is also visible from an anterior view at
stage 4 (Figure 4N). Ct-zic expression is maintained in
this anterior neural ectodermal domain throughout
development and is present in a sub-region of the developing brain which is clearly visible by stage 6 (Figure
4H; arrow). Previous fate mapping in C. teleta has
demonstrated that the majority of brain neurons are
derived from the anterior neural ectoderm [21,22] and it
is likely that Ct-zic neurons arise from Ct-zic positive
domains in the overlying ectoderm.
Neural ectodermal expression of Ct-zic is also detected
along the lateral edge of the ventral neural ectoderm at
stage 4 (Figure 4C and 4O, arrows). The lateral ectodermal Ct-zic domain expands toward the posterior of the
trunk (Figure 4F), and is then down-regulated in an
anterior to posterior wave, visible by late stage 6 (Figure
4G; white lines mark anterior border of expression).
From stages 7 - 9, Ct-zic expression in the lateral ectoderm is maintained in ventral-lateral cells in the growth
zone (Figure 4I, arrow), where new segments are forming. Although the exact lateral border of the ventral
neural ectoderm, which forms the ventral nerve chord
(VNC), has not been mapped, we think that lateral ectodermal Ct-zic expression is within the ventral neural
ectoderm. In support of this hypothesis, early neurogenic markers (Ct-ash and Ct-neurogenin; unpublished
observations) positionally overlap with Ct-zic expression,
although expression of the neurogenic markers extends
more medially than Ct-zic at similar stages. Furthermore, we observe Ct-zic in the VNC beginning at stage
6 (Figure 4G, arrowhead). Ct-zic positive cells in the
VNC are first detected in anterior segments where Ctzic expression is no longer apparent in the ventral-

Page 9 of 16

lateral ectoderm (Figure 4G). By stage 8, Ct-zic positive
cells are positioned medially and laterally within the
VNC (Figures 4K and 4Q). Thus, we conclude that Ctzic is expressed at the lateral edge of the presumptive
ventral neural ectoderm, in the VNC, and in a ventrallateral ectodermal domain in the growth zone where
new segments are forming.
Mesodermal expression of Ct-zic is detectable at
stages 3 to 9. Beginning at stage 3, expression is in one
or a few cells in an anterior subset of the bilateral mesodermal bands (Figure 4A and 4B). At stages 4 and 5,
mesodermal expression is detected in domains lateral to
the foregut (Figure 4C and 4E, arrowheads). The expression around the foregut expands during stages 6 - 7
(Figure 4G and 4I) and is in a sub-set of the Ct-twist
positive visceral mesoderm surrounding the foregut [23]
(Figure 4I, notched arrowhead). In addition, Ct-zic
expression is observed within a subset of Ct-twist-positive anterior mesoderm in the head (Figure 4I,
arrowhead).
There is additional Ct-zic mesodermal expression in
four longitudinal stripes (two on each side of the larva)
of segmentally-reiterated cell clusters. This expression
domain is first visible in a few cells at stage 5 (Figure
4E, 4F and 4O, arrowheads). The number of Ct-zic-positive cell clusters increases along the anterior-posterior
(A-P) axis as the animal elongates and new segments
form (Figure 4J and 4L, arrowheads). The A-P expansion of this pattern is reminiscent of the expansion of
Ttu-zic expression in chaetal sac associated mesoderm
[11]. By stages 7 and 8, when chaetae are present, Ct-zic
expression can be clearly observed in cells wrapping the
chaetal sacs (Figure 4J, 4L and 4P) but not in the chaetal
sacs themselves (Figure 4P, arrows), indicating that the
zic-positive cells are chaetal-sac associated mesoderm.
Ct-zic expression is maintained in these structures
through stage 9. In summary, mesodermal expression of
Ct-zic is found in the anterior portion of mesoderm
bands at stage 3, in the visceral mesoderm surrounding
the foregut, in the head mesoderm at the anterior tip of
the animal and in mesoderm associated with forming
chaetae.
Mlglis and Mlgli expression during development of the
ctenophore M. leidyi

No definitive zic homolog was identified in either Porifera or Ctenophora but phylogenetic analyses identified
gli/glis/nkl-like sequences in both clades (Figure 2). We
investigated the expression pattern of Mlglis and Mlgli
during the development of the ctenophore comb jelly
M. leidyi to gain insight into the evolution of gli/glis/
nkl/zic expression patterns as the family expanded during metazoan evolution. Both genes showed expression
in putative sensory structures in the floor of the apical

Layden et al. EvoDevo 2010, 1:12
http://www.evodevojournal.com/content/1/1/12

organ. However, Mlgli expression was not detected until
very late cydippid larval stages (Figure 5I and 5J) and
expression was weaker than the robust expression
observed for Mlglis.
Mlglis expression during M. leidyi development is
exclusively associated with the apical organ and is not
detected in any other tissues. Expression is first detected
upon the completion of gastrulation in two opposing
groups of cells in the presumptive apical organ ectoderm at the aboral pole of the developing embryo (Figure 5A). Over the next hour of development, expression
expands into two arches around the floor plate

Page 10 of 16

ectoderm of the apical organ (Figure 5B). The number
of cells in each domain expands from approximately
four to twenty, though it is not clear if the expansion is
due to nascent expression of Mlglis in adjacent cells or
via cell proliferation of the Mlglis expressing cells. Over
the next three hours, Mlglis domains assume a dumbbell
shape and eventually bifurcate (Figures 5C-E), resulting
in four distinct domains of expression in the floor plate
of the apical organ (Figure 5F). The apical organ contains a statocyst consisting of four groups of cells that
give rise to balancing cilia that support the mineral containing lithocytes. The statocyst functions as a balance

stage 4 (C, D and N), stage 5 (E, F and O), stage 6 (G and H), stage 7 (I and, J) and stage 8 (K, L, P and Q). Views are as indicated except that H
is a ventral-lateral view; M is an animal view; N and O are anterior views; P is a lateral view; and Q is a ventral view. In all lateral and ventral
views the anterior is to the left and the ventral is down in all lateral views. An asterisk (*) indicates the relative mouth position. Ct-zic is
detectable in micromeres on animal pole (M). Ct-zic mesodermal expression is detected in the anterior mesodermal band on the ventral side of
stage 3 animals (A and B) and in two bilateral mesoderm domains adjacent to the foregut at stages 4 and 5 (C and E, arrowheads). The
mesodermal expression expands around the foregut during stages 6 (G) and 7 (I, notched arrowhead). At stage 5, four lateral mesodermal
domains (F, arrowheads) are detected. At stage 7, lateral mesoderm domains form two longitudinal rows along the anterior-posterior (A-P) axis
(J, arrowheads). At stage 8, the longitudinal domains are clearly mesoderm associated with chaetae (L, arrowheads, and P), but not the chaetal
sac (P, arrows). Ct-zic is expressed in presumptive brain ectoderm in all stages (B, arrow, C-L and N). Ventrolateral expression at the lateral edge
of ventral neural ectoderm is detected at stage 4 (C, arrow) and stage 5 (F and O, arrows). The lateral neural ectoderm domain is downregulated in an A-P wave apparent at stage 6 (G, white line demarcates anterior border of expression) but remains expressed in the growth
zone (I and J, arrows). Ct-zic is also detectable in neurons in the brain (H, arrow) and, beginning at stage 6, in the ventral nerve cord (VNC; G,
white arrowhead). VNC expression persists through stage 8 (K, arrowhead, and Q). Medial and lateral ganglions are detected in each segment (Q,
which is a higher magnification of L). In Q, the white lines demarcate segmental boundaries.

resulting in four distinct domains (E), which are maintained through the hatching (F and G) and cydippid (H) stages. The four domains are
associated with the balancing cilia at the hatching stages (G arrows) and, in the cydippid larva, optical cross-sections of the balancing cilia are
clearly aligned with the centre of each of the four Mlglis domains (H arrows). Mlgli expression is first detected at 24hpf in four groups of cells
along the adesophageal plane of the apical organ (I and J). Unlike Mlglis, these cells are not associated with the balancing cilia but are in
domains consistent with previously described photoreceptor-like cells [25].

bilaterian common ancestor (B, green box).

balancing cilia of the apical organ statocyst beginning
shortly after gastrulation and expression is maintained
throughout development.
Mlgli expression is first detected in 24-hour-old larvae
in four groups of putative sensory cells in the floor of
the apical organ. Mlgli-expressing cells are symmetrically arranged within the floor of the apical organ in the
24 hpf cydippid larva (Figure 5I and 5J). Based on their
position, the Mlgli-expressing cells and the Mlglis
expressing cells represent two distinct populations of
cells (compare Figure 5J with 5H). The Mlgli expressing
cells are not associated with the balancing cilia and are
positioned further from the centre along the adesophageal plane of the apical organ than the Mlglis expressing
balancing cilia cells. The domains exhibiting Mlgli
expression are also associated with putative sensory
structures. Mlgli expression in the apical organ is reminiscent of previously identified structures, which morphologically resemble photoreceptors by electron
microscopy [25]. We conclude that Mlgli is expressed in
the putative photoreceptive cells in the apical organ and
has a distinct pattern from that observed for Mlglis.

Discussion
The origin of the metazoan zic gene

Understanding the origin of the zic gene family is ultimately tied to the understanding of the branching pattern
for basal metazoans. There are four basally branching
metazoan clades - the cnidarians, placozoans, ctenophores and poriferans. Previous work and our data
demonstrate that zic genes were present in the placozoan
and cnidarian clades, but absent from the current poriferan and ctenophore data sets (Figure 1). Although the
phylogenetic relationship between basal metazoans currently is debatable [26-30], the prevailing hypotheses
place cnidarians as the sister group to the bilaterians and
the divergence of placozoans after the origin of both poriferans and ctenophores [26-29]. Thus, the simplest
model is that zic family genes diverged once in the common ancestor of the placozoans/cnidarians/bilaterians
(Figure 6A, blue circle 2). The alternative hypothesis that zic genes evolved earlier (Figure 6A, blue circle 1)
but were lost in more basally branching clades (Figure
6A, grey hexagons) and maintained in placozoans, cnidarians and bilaterians - cannot be ruled out. However,
given the conserved expression of zic genes in mesodermal and neural tissues, the notion that zic genes would
be maintained in the placozoans, which have no definitive mesoderm or neural cells, but lost in an ctenophores,
which possess muscle cells and a clear nervous system,
seems less likely than the notion that zic genes evolved
prior to placozoan divergence, but after the ctenophore
and poriferan radiations. The T. adhaerens genome does
not possess clear gli/glis/nkl-like homologs [31], which

Page 12 of 16

may have been lost in conjunction with the loss of these
tissues in the placozoan lineage. The simplest model is a
single zic divergence event in the last common ancestor
of the placozoans, cnidarians and bilaterians.
Regardless of when zic genes evolved, they probably
diverged from a gli/glis/nkl-like gene. The basally
branching ctenophore and poriferans likely possessed at
least two gli/glis-like genes, arguing that a gli/glis/nkllike gene, which is lacking in non-metazoans, was present and already duplicated at least once at, or near the
time of, the emergence of the earliest metazoans. The
presence of the poriferan Amqgli2/3b sequence suggests
that a third gli/glis/nkl-like gene may have existed prior
to the divergence of poriferans and ctenophores. However, Amqgli2/3b may also represent a lineage specific
duplication. As the gli/glis/nkl clades represent a single
sister group to the zic clade, it is unclear whether a gli,
glis or nkl gene duplication/divergence would have given
rise to the zic family. No clear nkl genes are present in
the basal metazoans, except for the cnidarians, arguing
that duplication of a gli or glis-like gene resulted in the
divergence of the zic family. However, the existence and
phylogenetic position of the Amqgli2/3b gene raises
concerns about this model. Duplication or divergence of
an Amqgli2/3b-like gene could have also given rise to
the zic family. Further resolution of the branching pattern of basal metazoans and sampling for gli/glis/nkl/zic
genes in ctenophore and poriferan species is required
before more a finite hypotheses can be drawn about the
evolutionary origin and precursor of the zic gene family.
Two distinct gli similar (glis) sub-families exist

Though the glis and nkl gene sub-family names have
been used interchangeably, nkl should uniquely identify
the glis2/sug gene family. glis2 genes were originally
described as neurogenic kruppel like (nkl) genes [32],
while the glis1/3 genes had been identified as gli similar
[33]. Our data suggest that the nkl and glis genes represent two distinct clades. The glis clade consists of glis1,
glis3 and the D. melanogaster lameduck (lmd) homologs
(Figure 2), and the nkl clade consists of glis2 and D. melanogaster sugarbabe (sug) homologs (Figure 2). This distinction is also supported by a recent investigation of
C2H2 ZF genes in amphioxus. The authors of that study
identified two distinct strongly supported glis clades for
glis2 and glis1/3 genes [34]. We propose that the nkl
gene sub-family name should be used to uniquely identify
the sug and glis2 genes as a distinct gene sub-family.
ZOC and ZF-NC domains pre-date emergence of Bilateria

The cnidarian-bilaterian zic ortholog contained a ZFNC-like domain. The first eight amino acids of the published ZF-NC conserved sequence (GAFFRYMR(0-7aa)
IKQE) [1] are 86% identical and 100% similar in the

Layden et al. EvoDevo 2010, 1:12
http://www.evodevojournal.com/content/1/1/12

putative ZF-NC domain of NvZicA (GAFFRFMR; Figure
1B). In most ZF-NC sequences characterized to date,
the arginine residue at position 8 is followed by a
QPIKQE sequence (Figure 1B). The corresponding
NvZicA sequence (SPAKDN) is 50% similar to the Cterminal portion of the ZF-NC domain (Figure 1B).
Lastly, although the first part of the consensus domain
is missing in the TadZic sequence, the last four amino
acids (AKQE) are 75% identical and 100% similar to the
consensus sequence. As no functional mapping has been
conducted on the ZF-NC domain and there are strong
sequence similarities between the ZF-NC regions of
early branching metazoans and bilaterians, it seems
likely that presence of a ZF-NC domain may predate the
urbilaterian zic gene (Figure 6C, green square).
NvZicA-E each contain all, or some of, the reported,
and/or proposed, ZOC consensus sequence or have
amino acids in similar functional groups to the consensus sequence (Figure 1C). In the case of NvZicE, the
actual sequence is not identical to the consensus
sequence, but 100% similarity is observed in the five Nterminal amino acids (Figure 1C). In fact, the NvZicE
sequence is arguably more similar to the consensus
sequence than the oligochaete Ttu-Zic sequence (compare NvZicE and TtuZic; Figure 1C), which has a ZOC
domain [1]. Thus, we suggest that the conserved ZOC
and ZOC-like domains in the Nematostella Nvzic genes
supports the inclusion of the ZOC domain in the cnidarian-bilaterian ancestral zic gene (Figure 6C, red
square). Our results suggest that previously undescribed
ZOC domains are present in platyhelminthes, nematode
and urochordate zic genes. Thus, all sampled bilaterian
clades to date now have at least one lineage with a zic
gene containing a ZOC domain.
ZOC domains have been shown to have two functions
in in vitro transcription assays. The MmuZic2 ZOC
domain has been demonstrated to increase Zic transcription factor activity and to bind the transcription
factor Mfa-1 [4]. Currently it is not clear if the ZOC
domain increases Zic transcription factor activity via
intramolecular interactions, intermolecular interactions
or both in vivo. Future studies focused on characterizing
the activity of cnidarian ZOC sequences are required in
order to verify the existence of functional ZOC domains
in the cnidarians. Identification and comparative analysis
of ZOC interacting proteins in both cnidarian and bilaterian lineages may be useful for determining the molecular relationships of zic gene function in metazoan
development and evolution.
Evolution of mesodermal zic expression

Mesodermal expression of zic genes is present throughout the Bilateria. In D. melanogaster, opa is expressed
broadly throughout the mesoderm primordia of the

Page 13 of 16

segmented region of the embryo [8]. In both lophotrochozoans studied thus far (T. tubifex and C. teleta) zic is
expressed in a segmentally reiterated pattern in mesoderm associated with the chaetal sacs [12] (Figure 4)
and, in chordates, zic expression is observed in a segmented pattern in dorsal domains of forming somites.
In addition, within protostomes, zic homologs are
expressed in visceral mesoderm [surrounding foregut in
C. teleta (Figure 4) and around a portion of the forming
midgut in D. melanogaster] [8]. In Cnidaria, we observe
Nvzic expression in the gastrodermis, a bifunctional
endomesodermal tissue, in the forming tentacles, around
the pharynx and in the endomesodermal component of
the directive mesenteries (Figure 4).
One hypothesis raised by our data is that bilaterian
mesodermal zic expression is derived, at least in part,
from the endomesodermal expression that existed in the
common ancestor of the Bilateria and Cnidaria. The
expression of NvzicD and NvzicE in tentacle endomesoderm and NvzicD in endomesoderm surrounding the
pharynx supports this hypothesis. The tentacles are capable of multiple complex movements, including capture
and transport of food to the oral opening due to the
high density of myoepithelial cells. It is possible that
there are similarities between tentacle endomesoderm
and bilaterian musculature. Future work characterizing
cell types expressing NvzicD and NvzicE and comparing
the zic function in N. vectensis endomesoderm will provide an insight to the overall relationship of cnidarian
endomesoderm to bilaterian endoderm and mesoderm.
zic expression in neural development

Our data support an ancestral role for zic genes as regulators of neural sub-type development. Expression and
function of zic homologs in neural development is present throughout the Bilateria. However, only in the
chordate lineage does zic expression and function
include the entire neurogenic region in the early
embryo. This suggests that, though zic genes have a
conserved neural role in bilaterian animals, the ancestral
role was probably sub-type specification. Nvzic genes are
expressed in the presumptive and developing tentacle
buds in both the endoderm and ectoderm in the cnidarian N. vectensis (Figure 3J and 3O and 4E, respectively).
The tentacles are highly neuralized structures [35], suggesting that zic may be regulating tentacular neurogenesis. In support of this hypothesis, a number of neural
genes (Nvelav, NvanthoRF, Nvmushashi, Nvgcm) and
cross-reactive antibodies against the serotonin and
GABA neuropeptides are detected at high levels in the
developing tentacle endoderm and ectoderm [35]. In
addition, NvzicE expression in the forming apical tuft
sensory organ (Figure 3M) is consistent with a role in
neural development. zic expression in the apical tuft of

Layden et al. EvoDevo 2010, 1:12
http://www.evodevojournal.com/content/1/1/12

echinoderms has also been described [36]. We describe
expression of Mlglis and Mlgli in the ctenophore M. leidyi in neural structures of the developing apical organ
(Figure 5). Thus, we suggest that the role of zic genes in
neural development may have been shared with a gli/
glis/nkl/zic ancestral gene. This is also supported by the
observations that gli, glis and nkl genes all have
described roles in metazoan neurogenesis [2,3]. Previous
studies and our data, taken together, support the
hypothesis that one of the ancestral roles of the zic gene
family was to specify neural sub-types.
Zic homologs may have been co-opted to pattern
segmentally reiterated structures along the A-P axis in
Bilateria

In the lophotrochozoans T. tubifex and C. teleta, zic is
expressed in mesoderm associated with segmentally reiterated chaetae. In amphioxus and vertebrates, zic homologs are expressed in the dorsal region of somites. Both
somitic expression and mesodermal expression associated with chaetae indicate a role in segmental musculature formation for zic homologs in lophotrochozoans
and chordates. C. teleta zic homologs are also expressed in a reiterated pattern in the ventral nerve cord,
reflecting the segmental organization of its body plan
(Figure 4). Likewise, opa has a role promoting the proneural gene achaete expression in each segment during
D. melanogaster neurogenesis [9]. opa mutants were originally identified for their pair-rule phenotype (every
other segment disrupted) [37]. However, opa’s ubiquitous expression throughout the presumptive segmented
region is distinct from the typical seven-stripe pair-rule
pattern. In addition, opa is required for proper expression of the wg (wnt) segment polarity gene in all parasegments [7]. Together, these data suggest that zic
homologs function to pattern segmentally reiterated
structures and molecular domains in bilaterians, but are
unlikely to function directly in the segmentation process. Rather, the lack of similarity between zic expressing reiterated structures across bilaterian lineages
suggests that zic genes, due to their ancestral roles in
neural and mesoderm development in a cnidarian-like
ancestor, have been co-opted multiple times downstream of the segmentation programme to pattern various segmentally iterated structures.

Conclusions
Based on our analysis, we propose that the first
metazoan zic arose from a gli/glis/nkl-like gene prior to
the emergence of the Placozoa, but after the divergence
of both Ctenophora and Porifera. ZOC and ZF-NC
domains were probably present in the ancestral zic gene
shared by the cnidarian-bilaterian common ancestor.
We hypothesize that the metazoan zic neural expression,

Page 14 of 16

which is present in all animals assayed thus far, may be
derived from the expression of an ancestral gene in sensory cells. We also propose that the mesodermal expression of bilaterian zic genes may be derived from
gastrodermal expression of zic homologs in a cnidarianbilaterian ancestor. Lastly, we suggest that zic genes
have been co-opted multiple times down stream of segmentation programmes to pattern segmentally reiterated
structures in some bilaterian clades. In summary, our
results raise an interesting hypothesis about the molecular link between cnidarian endomesoderm and bilaterian
mesoderm, and suggest that a role for zic genes in neurogenesis may be an ancient metazoan feature.

Methods
Identification of candidate gli/glis/nkl/zic genes

In order to identify candidate zic genes we searched
published genomic resources, Trichoplax adhaerens
http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Triad1/Triad1.home.html,
Nematostella vectensis http://genome.jgi-psf.org/
Nemve1/Nemve1.home.html, Capitella teleta http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Capca1/Capca1.home.html, the unpublished genome of the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi
(NIH), the Amphimedon queenslandica http://spongezome.metazome.net/cgi-bin/gbrowse/amphimedon/ and
using keyword or TBLASTN and BLASTX searches
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/. We also used previously identified degenerate PCR primers [1] in order
to attempt to clone zic fragments from the mixed stage
embryonic cDNA acoel Convolutriloba longifissura,
sponge Ephydatia muelleri and ctenophore Mnemiopsis
leidyi using previously described zic specific primers [1].
Degenerate fragments were cloned by TA cloning into
the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, CA, USA) and
sequenced (Macrogen, Seoul, Korea). Sequences were
used to design nested 5’ and 3’ RACE primers for each
candidate sequence. Full-length sequences were obtained
by compiling 5’ and 3’ RACE sequences. Finally,
sequences were confirmed by amplifying the full length
sequence from mixed stage embryonic cDNA.
Phylogenetic analysis

Full length sequences for Gli, Glis and Zic proteins were
aligned using the Muscle Alignment [38] web server
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/muscle/index.html. The protein sequences were trimmed using the N-terminal
cysteine residue of the ZF1 domain and C-terminal histidine residue of the ZF5 domain to demarcate the five
C2H2 ZF domains (Additional File 1). A Bayesian phylogenetic analysis was carried out using MrBayes 3.1.2
[19] with a mixed protein model for 1,000,000 generations sampled every 100 generations with four chains.
The Jones model was chosen with a posterior probability of 1. A summary ‘consensus’ tree was generated in

Layden et al. EvoDevo 2010, 1:12
http://www.evodevojournal.com/content/1/1/12

MrBayes using the last 7500 trees (30,000 total trees)
representing 750,000 stationary generations. Posterior
probabilities were calculated from the ‘consensus’ tree.
A maximum likelihood analysis (using PhyML 3.0 [20])
was also conducted. The Jones model is not present in
PhyML 3.0 so the JTT model of evolution (selected via
ProtTest [39]) was used with 1000 bootstrap replicates
to find the most likely tree: the JTT model is not present in MrBayes. Thus, identical models could not be
used for each analysis.
Alignment of ZOC and ZF-NC domains

The C-terminal domain of full-length alignments
derived from Muscle alignment (above) was trimmed
from the third amino acid after the first cysteine residue
of ZF1. The remaining N-terminal portions of the proteins were then realigned using Muscle and viewed
using MacVector version 11.1.1 (MacVector, Inc, NC,
USA).
RNA in situ hybridization and image analysis

We performed in situ hybridizations, as previously
described, for Mnemiopsis leidyi [40], N. vectensis [32]
and C. teleta [21]. All images for M. leidyi and N. vectensis were acquired using a Zeiss Axioskop 2 in conjunction with the Axiocam HRc and Axio vision 4.7
software (Zeiss), Jena, Germany. C. teleta images were
acquired using a Zeiss Axioskop 2 microscope and a
SPOT Flex digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc,
MI, USA) in conjunction with the Spot Advanced version 4.6 software (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc). Additional image processing was done with Helicon Focus
software (Helicon Soft Ltd. Kharkov, Ukraine) for some
images as indicated in figure legends. Additional images
for N. vectensis and M. leidyi genes shown here are
available in the Kahi Kai image database http://www.
kahikai.org/.
