Abstract
Background: Wheat, barley, and rye, of tribe Triticeae in the Poaceae, are among the most
important crops worldwide but they present many challenges to genomics-aided crop
improvement. Brachypodium distachyon, a close relative of those cereals has recently emerged as a
model for grass functional genomics. Sequencing of the nuclear and organelle genomes of
Brachypodium is one of the first steps towards making this species available as a tool for researchers
interested in cereals biology.
Findings: The chloroplast genome of Brachypodium distachyon was sequenced by a combinational
approach using BAC end and shotgun sequences derived from a selected BAC containing the entire
chloroplast genome. Comparative analysis indicated that the chloroplast genome is conserved in
gene number and organization with respect to those of other cereals. However, several
Brachypodium genes evolve at a faster rate than those in other grasses. Sequence analysis reveals
that rice and wheat have a ~2.1 kb deletion in their plastid genomes and this deletion must have
occurred independently in both species.
Conclusion: We demonstrate that BAC libraries can be used to sequence plastid, and likely other
organellar, genomes. As expected, the Brachypodium chloroplast genome is very similar to those of
other sequenced grasses. The phylogenetic analyses and the pattern of insertions and deletions in
the chloroplast genome confirmed that Brachypodium is a close relative of the tribe Triticeae.
Nevertheless, we show that some large indels can arise multiple times and may confound
phylogenetic reconstruction.

Findings
Plastids are key organelles of green plants, carrying out
functions like photosynthesis, starch storage, nitrogen
and sulfate metabolism, and synthesis of chlorophyll, car-

otenoids, fatty acids and nucleic acids [1]. Plastids have
multiple copies of a circular, double-stranded DNA chromosome, each with a set of approximately 110 genes
highly conserved in sequence and organization [2].

In addition to their important biological roles, plastids
have the potential to make a big impact on biotechnology. Plastid transformation, achieved via homologous
recombination, is very advantageous compared to nuclear
genome transformation mainly because it can generate
high levels of gene expression and the recombinant DNA
is more easily contained since chloroplasts are maternally
inherited in most species of angiosperms [3].
The family Poaceae, with approximately 10,000 species,
contains the world's most important crops. The tribe Triticeae, of subfamily Pooideae, includes species grown in
temperate regions, some of which are of great economic
importance; i.e., wheat, rye, triticale, and barley. Despite
their contribution to human food supply, members of the
Triticeae are not easily amenable to functional genomics
aimed at crop improvement because of their large genome
size and difficulty in transformation.
Brachypodium distachyon, a small grass in the Pooideae, has
recently emerged as a new model species for functional
genomics of temperate grasses. Brachypodium offers many
advantages as a model grass; among them, its reduced
stature, short life cycle, and small genome [4].
In the last few years a considerable effort has been made
to develop genetic and molecular tools for Brachypodium,
including ESTs [5], Bacterial Artificial Chromosome
(BAC) libraries [6], cytological characterization of accessions [7-9], and techniques to perform rapid and efficient
transformation [10,11]. Finally, sequencing of the Brachypodium distachyon genotype Bd21 has been initiated by the
DOE Joint Genomics Institute and will soon be available
to the public.
Here we report the sequencing of the chloroplast genome
of the Bd21 genotype of Brachypodium, and perform a
sequence analysis and phylogeny reconstruction with the
completely sequenced chloroplast genomes from seven
grass species. We compare the evolutionary dynamics of
Brachypodium chloroplast genes with those of wheat, rice
and maize, and discuss the significance of some indels in
the framework of grass evolution.
Sequencing of the Brachypodium chloroplast genome
Sequencing of plastid genomes is usually done by isolation of chloroplasts followed by purification and amplification of plastid DNA for library construction. To
sequence the chloroplast genome of Brachypodium distachyon, we took advantage of existing BAC libraries [12] and
identified several chloroplast BACs from a database of
BAC end sequences (BES). In our analysis, 1,725 BES
matched wheat chloroplast queries. Clones generated
from a single restriction of the chloroplast genome should
contain the entire chloroplast genome and its two BES

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/1/61

would assemble in the same region in opposite orientations. The two BES from BAC DH037I03 matched backto-back the sequence of the wheat psbC gene (Fig. 1C).
Overall, we identified over 30 BACs harboring the complete chloroplast genome, suggesting that this strategy is
efficient in identifying full-length chloroplast genomes
from genomic BAC libraries.
As expected, the chloroplast sequence assembled using
the BES contained many gaps due to the distance between
restriction sites (Fig. 1). To complete the Brachypodium
chloroplast genome, a shotgun sequencing library of
DH037I03 was constructed. The complete genome
sequence was assembled using 1,725 BES, 410 sequences
from the shotgun library, and 264 gap-filling sequences
generated by primer walking. The sequence coverage of
the entire chloroplast genome is 8.9×.
Genome organization of Brachypodium chloroplast
The chloroplast genome of Brachypodium distachyon is
135,197 bp in length. The Inverted Repeats (IR) are
21,540 bp in length each, and the Large Single Copy
(LSC) and Small Single Copy (SSC) regions are 79,446 bp
and 12,668 bp long respectively. The Brachypodium chloroplast genome contains 118 unique genes, 18 of which
are duplicated in the IRs, making a total of 136 genes of
known function. In addition, there are 9 predicted open
reading frames (ORFs) and 3 tRNA pseudogenes. With a
few exceptions discussed below, the gene number and
order are identical to other grass chloroplast genomes
(Fig. 2).
Grass chloroplast phylogeny based on complete
chloroplast genomes
In a landmark article that included data from multiple
sources, the Grass Phylogeny Working Group [13] examined relationships among grasses using a large and diverse
assemblage of species. That study highlighted the existence of two major lineages, the BEP clade and the PACCAD clade, that together encompass the majority of
grasses. The BEP clade includes the subfamilies Bambusoideae, Ehrhartoideae, and Pooideae. Rice belongs to subfamily Ehrhartoideae while wheat, barley, bentgrass, and
Brachypodium are in the Pooideae. The PACCAD clade
includes several subfamilies, among them the Panicoideae, a large group of mainly tropical and subtropical species, some of which are important crops worldwide, like
maize, sugarcane, and sorghum.

So far, all phylogeny reconstructions of the Poaceae have
used selected genes or partial regions as data. However,
with sequenced chloroplast genomes of several species in
this family and the computer power to align them, it is
possible for the first time to perform whole chloroplast
genome phylogenic analyses. To examine if the genome-

wide phylogenic analysis is consistent with those based
on selected genes, we employed Bayesian [14] and Maximum Parsimony [15] methods to reconstruct a grass phylogeny using whole chloroplast sequences. Both Bayesian
and Maximum Parsimony estimates produced the same
topology with maximum node support (Fig. 3). The
topology shown on Fig. 3 contained 99% of the Bayesian
credible trees and the tree is in agreement with the results
obtained with a larger group of species [13]. The phylogram also shows that branches in the BEP clade are much
longer than those in the PACCAD clade. A similar result
was found by Saski et al. [16] in a phylogenetic study
using 61 protein-coding genes, indicating that the rates of
evolution are higher in the BEP clade compared to the
PACCAD species sampled here. However, it is possible
that these slower rates do not extend to other species of
the PACCAD clade, since maize, sorghum, and sugarcane

are closely related, with all three belonging to subfamily
Panicoideae.
Evolution of Brachypodium chloroplast genes
For a given protein-coding gene, the proportion of substitutions that do not cause a change in the amino acid
sequence (synonymous) to those that do (nonsynonymous) is a commonly used estimator of the evolutionary
dynamics operating on that gene [15]. To find out if
Brachypodium plastid genes show the same evolutionary
dynamics as other grasses we calculated the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rates for Brachypodium chloroplast genes using tobacco as an outgroup.

We found that the nonsynonymous/synonymous ratios
for Brachypodium chloroplast genes are similar to those of
rice, maize and wheat, with photosynthetic genes having

ture in the chloroplast genomes of grasses allowed us to
align the chloroplast genome sequences of eight grass species at the genome-wide level.

phylogram was obtained from an exhaustive parsimony

shown as posterior probability after 1000000 generations
and bootstrap values from 1000 repetitions. The GenBank
accesions used for the analyses are X15901 (rice), EU325680
(Brachypodium), EF115543 (bentgrass), EF115541 (barley),
X86563 (maize), AP006714 (sugarcane), EF115542 (sorghum), and AB042240 (wheat). The sequences were aligned
and visualized using mVISTA [25]. MrBayes [14] and PAUP*
[24] were used to analyze the data.

the lowest ratio (Table 1), in agreement with previous
findings [17]. Within the NADH class, ndhB and rps12
have very low rates of both kinds of substitutions compared to other genes in the same class, a result explained
by their position, in the IRs and most likely due to the
dynamics of the IRs' evolution rather than to evolutionary
constrains on ndhB and rps12.
The rate of evolution of a particular gene; i.e., the estimated number of substitutions per site, can vary among
different organisms for reasons like rapid gene duplication that creates opportunity for sequence divergence, different generation time, and various DNA repair
mechanisms [15]. We conducted a relative rate test [18]
for all Brachypodium chloroplast genes with known function against their orthologs in maize, wheat, and rice and
found that most Brachypodium genes evolve at similar rates
to those of wheat, rice, and maize. However, there are
unequal rates of evolution (at P = 0.05) in 15 genes and
17 cases of species comparisons, and Brachypodium genes
evolved at a faster rate in 14 out of those 17 comparisons
(Table 2).
Sequence comparison among grass chloroplast genomes
The structure and gene number of the chloroplast genome
is very similar among land plants, although the Poaceae
have three large inversions compared to the canonical
plastid genome usually represented by the tobacco chloroplast genome [19]. This conservation of overall struc-

Comparison of the sequences of eight chloroplast
genomes (only rice, Brachypodium, wheat, and maize are
represented on Fig. 2) reveals several regions of high
sequence length polymorphism, as well as shared deletions and insertions. The IRs show lower sequence divergence among grasses than the single-copy region (Fig. 1),
a result previously reported by other authors [20]. The
region between rbcL and psaI (at position ~54 kb, Fig. 2) is
one of the most polymorphic chloroplast loci in grasses.
In rice, this region is 1532 bp long and contains ORF133
and the accD gene, but it is much shorter in other grasses.
In Brachypodium, both ORF133 and accD are missing, and
the entire rbcL-psaI spacer region, containing only the rbcL
3'UTR and psaI promoter sequences, is reduced to 296 bp
long.
As expected from its phylogenetic placement, Brachypodium shares several indels with barley, wheat, and bentgrass, all of which are in subfamily Pooideae, including a
410 bp deletion in ORF70 (~14.5 kb, Fig. 2) and the
duplication of a 5' portion of ndhH IRb (~102 K in Fig. 2)
that is also shared with rice [16,21]. The size of this duplication is variable, ranging from 238 bp in rice to 311 bp
in Brachypodium. Insertions in rpoC2 (~25 K, Fig. 2) have
been described and used previously in phylogenetic analyses [[13], and references therein] and will not be discussed here.
Rice and wheat have identical and independently derived
deletions
Despite the overall sequence conservation of IRs, the
region between ndhB and trnI (~84 K and ~131 in Fig. 2)
appears to be a hot spot for large indels. Previously, Ogihara et al [21] described a 2,131 bp deletion in wheat and
rice with respect to maize. This deletion is located
between ORF249 and ORF28 (~84 K and ~131 K, Fig. 2).
Because rice is more closely related to wheat than to
maize, the authors concluded that the deletion was
present in the common ancestor of rice and wheat. However, this deletion is present only in rice and wheat, which
are not sister species (Fig. 3), whereas in Brachypodium,
barley, and bentgrass there is a smaller deletion of about
1,141 bp (Fig. 4).

To confirm that the 2,131-bp deletion in rice and wheat
was not an artifact of the alignment or missing sequence,
we used the Brachypodium sequence missing in wheat and
rice and blasted it against grass sequence databases. We
recovered sequences from many grasses except wheat and
rice, confirming the presence of the deletion in their
genomes. In addition, we searched the GenBank

that the region is present in species representing diverse
lineages of flowering plants, including the monocot Dioscorea, the early-diverging angiosperms Amborella and
Nymphaea, and several core eudicots (data not shown).
Therefore, we concluded that the 2,131-bp deletions in

the wheat and rice chloroplast genomes are derived characters that arose independently in those species.
The 2,131-bp deletions in rice and wheat are identical in
both IRs and the sequences bordering them align unambiguously with those of other grasses (Fig. 4). In addition,
the lack of direct short repeats in sequences indicates that

recombination via short repeats is not the way by which
they arose. Thus, despite the fact that deletions of varying
lengths in the ndhB-trnI region seem to be common in the
BEP clade, the mechanism underlying these specific deletions remains unclear. In tobacco, nucleotide mutations
in plastid coding sequences are quickly eliminated by
gene conversion, a process facilitated by the polyploid
nature of the plastid genome [22]. Whatever the mechanism is that generates deletions in the trnI-ndhB region in
species of the BEP clade, their multiple occurrences suggests that they may provide a selective advantage to those
species in order to overcome gene conversion and become
fixed in the population.

analyses. GRL wrote the algorithm to search BES with
wheat queries and assembled BES on the genome. YGU
designed and coordinated the study. Both OA and YQG
supervised the work and collaborated in the manuscript
preparation. All authors have read and approved the final
version of the manuscript.
