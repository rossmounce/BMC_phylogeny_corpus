Abstract
Background: Genetic variation in the regulatory region of the human serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) has been
shown to affect brain functionality and personality. However, large heterogeneity in its biological effects is observed,
which is at least partially due to genetic modifiers. To gain insight into serotonin transporter (SERT)-specific genetic
modifiers, we studied an intercross between the Wistar SERT-/- rat and the behaviorally and genetically divergent Brown
Norway rat, and performed a QTL analysis.
Results: In a cohort of >150 intercross SERT-/- and control (SERT+/+) rats we characterized 12 traits that were previously
associated with SERT deficiency, including activity, exploratory pattern, cocaine-induced locomotor activity, and
abdominal and subcutaneous fat. Using 325 genetic markers, 10 SERT-/--specific quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for
parameters related to activity and exploratory pattern (Chr.1,9,11,14), and cocaine-induced anxiety and locomotor
activity (Chr.5,8) were identified. No significant QTLs were found for fat parameters. Using in silico approaches we
explored potential causal genes within modifier QTL regions and found interesting candidates, amongst others, the 5HT1D receptor (Chr. 5), dopamine D2 receptor (Chr. 8), cannabinoid receptor 2 (Chr. 5), and genes involved in fetal
development and plasticity (across chromosomes).
Conclusions: We anticipate that the SERT-/--specific QTLs may lead to the identification of new modulators of
serotonergic signaling, which may be targets for pharmacogenetic and therapeutic approaches.
Background
The most ancient and highly conserved neuromodulator
serotonin (5-HT) plays a critical role in central nervous
system processes including, emotion, mood, learning,
memory, feeding, sensory processing, and sleep. Not surprisingly, a regulatory variation in the gene encoding the
serotonin transporter (5-HTTLPR), the master controller
in the fine-tuning of 5-HT signaling, has been associated
with a variety of disorders, such as depression, autism,
schizophrenia, and eating disorders [1]. However, findings are rather inconsistent across studies. While geneenvironment interactions may contribute significantly to
the observed phenotypic variation, gene-gene interactions are likely to add considerably as well. Based on the
postulation that Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs), loci on
chromosomes that contain trait-linked genetic modifiers,
are different in personality traits and disorders [2,3], we

argue that identification of serotonin transporter (SERT)dependent QTLs will lead to both molecular targets for
(individualized) pharmacological disease interventions,
and molecular targets mediating disease resilience.
It has been established that people with the short (s)
allelic variant of the 5-HTTLPR, which is associated with
serotonin transporter (5-HTT; SLC6A4; human, SERT;
rodent) down-regulation compared to the long (l) allelic
variant, score higher on neuroticism (emotional instability) and lower on agreeableness (cooperation) [4,5]. These
personality traits are related to changes in the functional
integrity of brain regions such as the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex [6]. There are several indications
that these personality traits and brain endophenotypes
are modified by other major polymorphisms. For example, the MET allelic variant of the BDNF (brain-derived
neurotrophic factor) VAL66 MET polymorphism was
found to protect against 5-HTTLPR-s allele-induced
effects on the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex [7].
Further, we have shown that the MET allelic variant of the
COMT Met58Val polymorphism positively interacts with

the 5-HTTLPR-s allele and exacerbates emotional decision making [8]. Others reported that the COMT-MET
and 5-HTTLPR-s alleles have an additive effect on
amygdala, hippocampus and limbic cortex responsivity to
unpleasant stimuli [9], and that the COMT-VAL allele in
interaction with the 5-HTTLPR-s allele raises persistence
scores [10]. Also, a significant interaction between the 5HTTLPR-l allele and the dopamine D4 receptor-7 repeat
polymorphism in relation to novelty seeking has been
reported [11], and a significant interaction between the 5HTTLPR-s allele and the DRD4-7 repeat for harm avoidance [12].
Besides these hypothesis-driven studies, genome-wide
association or linkage studies are rising in psychiatry to
identify gene × gene interactions in a non-hypothesis
driven manner. Yet, environmental factors, which by
themselves account for phenotypic variance [13] and
interact with the 5-HTTLPR [14], pose difficulties in
extracting gene × gene interactions. Experimental laboratory animal studies provide the possibility to control
these factors. SERT knockout (SERT-/-) rodents are very
valuable in modeling the 5-HTTLPR, as they show brain
and behavioral endophenotypes that resemble heterogeneity observed for the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism in
humans [15-18]. As an example, SERT-/- rodents show a
variety of anxiety-related symptoms [15] that are strongly
influenced by genetic background [19]. More specifically,
it was shown that SERT+/+ and SERT-/- mice on a 129/S6
congenic background did not differ in two behavioral
tests for anxiety, while SERT-/- mice on a B6 congenic
background showed increased anxiety-like behavioral
responses and reduced exploratory locomotion in the
very same tests. Based on the human 5-HTTLPR gene
interaction reports, we argue that genetic modifier(s) in
the 129/S6 background suppress high anxiety behavior in
129/S6 SERT-/- mice. Yet, the identity of such genetic
modifiers is unknown thus far.
Here we used the SERT-/- rat to identify genetic modifiers of the SERT gene. The rat was chosen because this
species has proven to be an important model organism
for human psychiatric disorders, for instance based on
the wealth of behavioral tests that have been developed
and validated in rats [20]. In addition, the advantage of
the rat is the availability of gene knockout models on an
outbred background. Although the genetic heterogeneity
of these strains is limited compared to human genetic
variation, it is more representative for natural genetic
variation compared to the inbred mouse strains. Moreover, the phenotypes we have found so far in the SERT-/rat match those found in SERT-/- mice, and correspond to
phenotypes found in humans carrying the s allelic variant
of the 5-HTTLPR [17,18,21]. In this study we focus on
activity and anxiety in an automated homecage setup,

cocaine-induced locomotor activity, and abdominal and
subcutaneous white adipose tissue (WAT), parameters
that are different between SERT-/- and SERT+/+ rats
[18,22,23], cover a broad spectrum of phenotypes and are
measurable in a high-throughput manner.
In rat, several QTLs have already been mapped using
simple sequence length polymorphism (SSLP) markers
[24]. To further optimize QTL mapping we recently generated, and validated, a genome-wide Single Nucleotide
Polymorphism (SNP) panel for 632 SNPs that are
homozygously polymorphic between the outbred Wistar
(WI) and inbred Brown Norway (BN) [25]. These two
strains are (phylo)genetically divergent and therefore very
useful in a genetic modifier screen based on natural
genetic variation. Combined with the robust and highthroughput measurable phenotypes of SERT-/- rats, we
aimed to provide a proof of principle for a genetic modifier screen in the rat and to identify SERT-/- selective
modifier QTLs that could be explored to prioritize candidate genes modifying SERT gene function. Our results
show that the rat is a versatile genetic model to identify
QTLs and that there are significant SERT-/- selective
QTLs in the genetic backgrounds that were used. Finally,
our work revealed interesting novel candidate genes that
interact with the serotonergic system function in the rat.

Results
Crossings

To create SERT+/+ and SERT-/- rats with mixed WI/BN
background we mated two male BN rats with five female
SERT-/- rats. Among the resulting SERT+/- F1 generation
we conducted brother-sister matings to produce an F2
population of 166 animals (Additional file 1 Table S1).
Because WI rats have a white fur and BN rats have a
brown-black fur, the F2 population had mixed fur colors.
The majority of the animals was either white or black,
and about 1/10 of the animals was white with black spots.
Because the Phenotyper had difficulties with tracking the
white/black animals were not included.
Analyses of phenotypes

We recorded a total of 12 phenotypic traits in the F0 and
F2 animals, including measurements for anxiety, locomotor activity, exploratory pattern, cocaine-induced locomotor activity (males only) and abdominal and
subcutaneous WAT (females only) (Figure 1, Additional
file 1 Tables S2-7). When testing the parental SERT+/+,
SERT-/- and BN animals we found that SERT-/- rats compared to SERT+/+ rats showed significant differences for
anxiety/locomotor activity (time time in shelter), exploratory pattern (immobility), cocaine-induced locomotor
activity [22], and abdominal WAT deposition [23]. We
also found significant Wistar-BN strain differences for
anxiety/locomotor activity (time in shelter), exploratory

pattern (immobility and strong mobility), cocaine sensitivity and abdominal/subcutaneous WAT. In addition,
significant genotype/strain effects were found for anxiety
(time in centre) and locomotor activity (distance moved),
but these parameters did not survive a bonferroni correction for multiple testing. Overall, these data indicate that
SERT-/- rats, compared to SERT+/+ rats, are more anxious
[18] and explore by ceasing movement and scanning of
their environment. Moreover, the data show that BN rats
generally move less, but move faster or more sudden
whenever they move. Also WAT is clearly reduced in BN
rats. By contrast, genotype differences for anxiety, activity
and exploratory patterns were absent in F2 SERT+/+ and
SERT-/- animals, while cocaine-induced anxiety and
abdominal WAT were significantly increased in F2 SERT/- rats compared to SERT+/+ rats.
Correlations between phenotypes

There are several phenotypic differences between SERT+/
+ and SERT-/- rats. If these differences are caused by the
same genetic loci, they should be correlated in the F2 animals. As illustrated in figure 2, we found significant correlations between different measures within the three
separate tests. Time in shelter and time in centre of the
Phenotyper correlated significantly with distance moved

and exploration-related parameters (immobility and
mobility), indicating that the level of anxiety is strongly
influenced by activity in the SERT-/- rats. Interestingly,
cocaine-induced anxiety (time in centre) was not correlated with the duration of the cocaine-induced locomotor
response (30-120 min after cocaine challenge), suggesting
that the anxiogenic effects of cocaine are particularly
associated with the immediate cocaine effects.
QTL analysis

The overall QTL analysis by CIM, including all genotypes
and sexes revealed two very strong linkage intervals on
chromosome 1 and 10 (data not shown). The linkage
interval at chromosome 1 (Chr.1) is located between 63
and 92 cM (LOD score = 41.8) and contains the Tyr gene,
which encodes the enzyme tyrosinase that catalyzes the
conversion of tyrosine to DOPAquinone in melanin biosynthesis and is responsible for the white coat color of
albino rats. This QTL is consistent with the mixture of
black and white coat colors among the F2 animals. Further, at Chr.10, between 67.13 - 67.155 cM, there is a peak
with a LOD score of 27.5 that contains the Slc6a4 (SERT)
gene (ENSRNOG00000003476), consistent with the
SERT-/- and SERT+/+ genotypes in our test sample.
Because no y-chromosome markers were included in the
screen, no QTL was found for sex.

When we conducted the CIM for genotypes separately
we identified 10 QTLs in the SERT-/- background (table
1). We obtained large effect sizes for cocaine-induced
time in centre and the duration of cocaine-induced locomotor activity (38%), while effect sizes were lower for
time in shelter (2.5%), distance moved (6%) and mobility
(19%) in the Phenotyper. No significant QTLs for time in
centre (anxiety), immobility, strong mobility, and WAT
were found. Also SERT+/+-linked QTLs were found (data
not shown). They did not overlap with SERT-/- associated
QTLs, indicating that the SERT-/- associated QTLs are
SERT gene specific.
For each of the significant LOD scores, we further
explored candidate genes using the Ensembl BioMart
tool. We took the estimated location of the QTL on the
chromosome and explored genes around the associated
markers within the region determined by the adjacent
non-significant markers. Although this is a rather rough
approach, and QTLs on gene rich chromosomes may lead
to aspecific candidate genes, it provides indices for
altered pathways that could be pinpointed in future
research. We took the intervals rather broadly because
the marker locations had been recalculated from physical
coordinates to genetic coordinates, which could be associated with deviations. If we would have taken a narrow
range we may have missed potential candidate genes. As
shown in additional file 1 table S8 (see table 1 for total

number of genes per QTL), the most apparent ones
involve the 5-HT1D and cannabinoid receptor 2 on Chr. 5
for the QTL that is linked to cocaine-induced locomotor
activity in SERT-/- rats. Further, among the candidate
genes associated with the QTL for cocaine-induced anxiety on Chr. 8 was the dopamine D2 receptor, locomotorassociated parameters in the Phenotyper were associated
with acetylcholine receptor subunit precursors (Chr. 9),
and time in shelter was associated with the cholecystokinin receptor type A gene (Chr. 14). We also found genes
involved in development, for instance ectoderm-neural
cortex protein 2 (Chr. 1), insulin-like growth factor 1
receptor precursor (Chr. 14), fibroblast growth factor 12
(Chr. 11), cell adhesion molecule 1 (Chr.8), beta-secretase
1 precursor (Chr. 8), caspase 9, apoptosis-related cysteine
peptidase (Chr. 5), and ephrin receptor EphA2 (Chr. 5).
Finally, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt signalling
pathway (tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor
type 9; Serine/Threorine kinases and phoshatases; 1phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
phosphatases)
may modify SERT-/- traits.
As a final part of the genetic modifier screen we
explored whether the SERT-/- QTLs overlap with known
QTLs for rat. We used the RGD, and found one QTL that
overlaps with a SERT-/- specific QTL: anxiety QTL 13
(84023578-129023578 bp [26]) is located in the region of

Discussion
Here we provide proof of principle for a rat QTL analysis
and identified significant SERT-/- specific QTLs, suggesting that there are genes throughout the genome interacting with the SERT gene in rat. In addition, we have
created an overview of candidate genes within QTL
regions that may interact with SERT, including genes
encoding 1] the 5-HT1D receptor, 2] components of
other neurotransmitter systems, or 3] developmental and
plasticity proteins.
We used BN rats to introduce genetic variance because
this strain is genetically most divergent from WI rats [27],
as confirmed by a phylogenetic analysis based on SNP
genotyping of a panel of inbred rat strains [25]. In this
study we show that the two strains also differ for behavioral traits and WAT. Overall, BN rats are less active, but
when they are active, their behavioral acts seem to be
more sudden and 'energetic'. Also, their anxiety level, as
measured by their avoidance of the centre of the test cage
seems to parallel that of SERT-/- rats [18], although significant effects were lost after Bonferroni correction. Further, it is apparent that BN rats are lean and exhibit less
WAT, which may relate to their rather close relation to
the wild rat [25]. BN rats are thus far mainly used as a reference strain for research on hypertension, inflammation
and glucose metabolism http://www.rgd.mcw.edu.. Our
findings indicate that the application of BN rats can be
extended to basic behavioral characteristics as well
cocaine sensitivity and WAT. BN rats are used to generate
rat Recombinant Inbred (RI) lines, together with the
spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR), and for congenic
lines using Dahl Salt Sensitive (SS) or Fawn Hooded
Hypertensive (FHH) rat strains, and it may therefore be
worthwhile to characterize these lines for anxiety, aberrant exploratory behavior, cocaine sensitivity, and WAT
deposition. We further show that BN alleles change the
differential phenotypes of SERT+/+ and SERT-/- rats. For
instance, while parental SERT-/- rats spent less time in the
shelter of the Phenotyper (effect size 2.5%) SERT-/- and
SERT+/+ with mixed BN/WI alleles did not differ for this
parameter. Further, mobility was strongly reduced in the
F2 population compared to the parental animals, which is
reflected in the relatively high effect size for this parameter (19%). The parental genotype differences for the locomotor response during the first 20 min and last 30-120
min of the cocaine challenge were not seen in F2 animals.
Vice versa, among F2 animals cocaine-induced anxiety
(time spent in centre) was increased in SERT-/- rats,
which was not seen in the parental animals. Apparently,
differential genetic modifiers may be involved in the

Page 6 of 11

onset of cocaine's psychomotor effects, the duration of
the response, and the anxiogenic effects of cocaine. The
effect sizes of 38% for these parameters indicate that
genetic modifiers explain a considerable amount of the
variance in the locomotor response to cocaine in SERT-/rats. Abdominal WAT was increased in both parental and
F2 SERT-/- rats compared to SERT+/+ rats, while F2, but
not parental, SERT-/- rats also exhibited increased subcutaneous WAT. Again, there are clear interactions between
BN and WI alleles.
To identify QTLs responsible for these behavioral and
WAT changes we performed a CIM, which fits parameters for a target QTL in one interval while simultaneously
fitting partial regression coefficients for "background
markers" to account for variance caused by non-target
QTL. This leads to the estimation of both the positions
and relative effects of putative QTLs on the chromosome.
CIM is strongly dependent on the choice of suitable
marker loci to serve as background markers. Since our
markers are evenly distributed over the genome with 2-10
cM intervals [25], risk for bias towards certain QTLs is
expected to be limited. The power of the QTL analysis
may be affected by the number of SNP markers we used,
but it has been shown that the power of QTL detection
and the standard errors of genetic effect estimates are little affected by an increase of marker density beyond 10
cM [27]. Indeed, despite the limited number of SNP
markers, we identified in the overall QTL analysis the Tyr
gene for coat color and the Slc6a4 (SERT) gene, indicating that the SNP panel and CIM approach are valid. Further, several significant SERT-/- dependent QTLs were
identified (table 1) for the Phenotyper-based data and
cocaine-induced locomotor activity, indicating that these
parameters are susceptible to SERT-related genetic modifiers. However, no significant LOD scores were found for
WAT parameters. Because of the strong genotype differences in both the P0 and F2 generations, we argue that
WAT is strongly influenced by the SERT itself, and not
(or to a limited extend) by genetic modifiers. We identified 10 significant QTLs for SERT-/- rats. The behavioral
traits link to chromosome 1, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 14. The QTL
on chromosome 9 is linked to mobility, distance moved
and time in shelter, suggesting that these traits are associated. Indeed, the correlation analysis revealed significant
correlations between these parameters (figure 2). Potentially, this QTL links to locomotor activity, and as such,
time spent in the shelter could be related to activity or
perhaps an altered circadian rhythm. Since time in shelter
was linked to multiple QTLs, this parameter may also be
influenced by other processes. Further, cocaine-induced
anxiety was linked to a QTL on Chr. 8 and the duration of
cocaine-induced locomotor activity was linked to a QTL
on Chr. 5, which is consistent with the lack of a correlation between the two (figure 2).

Among the candidate genetic modifiers underlying the
QTL for cocaine-induced locomotor activity is the 5HT1D receptor. The 5-HT1D receptor is a G proteincoupled autoreceptor [28] that is particularly involved in
the regulation of cranial vasoconstriction. Thereby, 5HT1D agonists have efficacy in the treatment of headache and migraine [29]. It is tempting to speculate that
genotype-dependent differences in vasoconstriction
influence the transport of cocaine in the brain. Also the
cannabinoid receptor 2 (Chr. 5) was linked to cocaineinduced locomotor activity, which may be related to its
modulatory role in regulation of SERT activity [30]. A
candidate gene associated with cocaine-induced anxiety
(time in centre) is the dopamine D2 receptor (Chr. 8). The
dopamine D2 receptor mediates both the rewarding and
anxiogenic effects of cocaine [31], and there are interactions between the dopamine D2 receptor and SERT in
mediating cocaine reward [32], both of which may modify SERT-/- rat behavioral responses to cocaine. Across
genes, we also found candidate genes involved in development and plasticity. Thus, altered neuronal differentiation (ectoderm-neural cortex protein 2 (Chr. 1)), together
with altered cell division (fibroblast growth factor 12
(Chr. 11)), cell differentiation (Insulin-like growth factor I
receptor precursor (Chr. 14)), apoptosis (apoptosisrelated cysteine peptidase (Chr. 5), caspase 9 (Chr. 9)),
vascular development (ephrin receptor EphA2 (Chr. 5),
cell adhesion molecule 1 (Chr.8)), and the formation of
myelin sheets (beta-secretase 1 precursor (Chr. 8)), may
shape the organization of brain networks and thereby
their functions. In this context it is important to note that
5-HT exerts several neurotrophic actions during early
brain development [33]. Defective clearance of 5-HT as
observed in the SERT-/- mice and rats causes a failure in
the maturation of the thalamocortical neurons [34], an
abnormal structural organization in the somatosensory
cortex [35] and altered morphology of pyramidal neurons
in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala [16]. In humans the
low function variant of the 5-HTTLPR is associated with
macroscopic structural and functional changes in corticolimbic regions such as the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala [6,36,37]. The genes involved in
development and plasticity may be the target of wellestablished signaling pathways such as the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt signaling pathway that mediates
cell growth, differentiation and survival [38]. Of interest,
a recent study found an epistatic interaction of Slc6a4
and Pten for macrocephaly in mice [39]. Given that Pten
is a key modulator of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinaseAkt signalling pathway, our findings may support the idea
that 5-HT modulates brain development via this pathway.
Some QTLs have been submitted at the RGD, but only
one overlaps with a SERT-/- specific QTL identified in this
study. Critical is that the WI rat has previously not been

Page 7 of 11

used in QTL analyses [40-42], which hampers the direct
comparison between QTLs. Nonetheless, anxiety QTL 13
on Chr.1 of Wistar-Kyoto rats [26] matches the time in
shelter parameter in SERT-/- rats. This finding suggests
that the WI-derived rat strain that was used in the previous study [26] had a sensitized serotonergic background.
Our study has some limitations that have to be mentioned. First, we used a relatively low number of animals
as well as SNPs. Although we found several significant
QTLs, the finding that some QTLs appear when SERT-/and SERT+/+ are combined (data not shown), suggests
that the inclusion of additional animals will reveal more
QTLs. Secondly, we standardized our screen as good as
possible and noted all environmental factors (e.g. day of
week, temperature, humidity, etc.). Yet, these environmental factors were not included in the analysis, leaving
the possibility that QTLs are partly determined by environmental influences. Given that the overall QTL analysis
revealed clear QTLs for coat color and genotype, but no
other QTLs, suggest that the role of environmental factors is rather limited in this study. Finally, we measured
very basic behaviors that may not be directly related to
human behaviors or personality features. We consider
this experiment as a primary screen providing targets for
more in-depth dissections of QTLs and their behavioral
correlates.

Conclusion
We have revealed novel QTLs that modify the behavioral
phenotypes of SERT deficiency in rats. Although the specific genetic modifiers remain to be identified, exploration of the QTL regions has lead to candidate genes that
plausibly interact with SERT. Therefore, not only a finetuning of the QTL regions by the inclusion of additional
markers and/or marker-assisted breeding and differential
crossing-overs among F2 animals will bring us closer to
the genetic modifiers, also a reverse genetics approach
[43-45] in which the candidate genes are studied in more
detail in SERT-/- rodents might be highly valuable. We
anticipate that the understanding of gene × gene interactions in SERT-/- rodents could contribute to the identification of 5-HTTLPR genetic modifiers in humans, and
thereby reveal molecular pathways that in interaction
with the 5-HTTLPR either increase disease vulnerability,
or provide disease resilience. This may further assist individualized therapies, given the broad spectrum of psychiatric conditions that are affected by the 5-HTTLPR.
Methods
All experiments were conducted with the approval of the
animal ethics committee of the Royal Academy of Sciences, The Netherlands. Experiments were designed to
minimize the number of required animals and their suffering.

Animals

To determine the parental phenotypes seven male and
five female WI SERT-/-, eight male and four female WI
SERT+/+, seven male and 10 female BN rats were tested in
the experimental setups. The BN rats were purchased
from Harlan at the age of 21 days. The SERT-/- and
SERT+/+ rats, which are generated by ENU-induced
mutagenesis [45] and were outcrossed for eight generations, were generated by SERT+/- and SERT+/- crossings in
our laboratory. The animals were ear clipped at the age of
two weeks under isoflurane anaesthesia, and genotyped
as described previously (forward primer: TCACAAAGCACTGAGACCAG; reverse primer: AACCTGCCAAGAGAGAGTTG [45,46]). At the age of three
weeks the animals were weaned and housed two or three
animals per cage in standard Macrolon® type III cages
with a shelter and a piece of wood, in temperature controlled rooms (21°C ± 2) and relative humidity of 60 ±
15% with standard 12 hour light/dark cycle (lights off at 6
p.m.) and food and water ad libitum. At the age of 62-80
days the male rats were tested in the Phenotyper (Noldus
Information Technology, Wageningen, The Netherlands)
for three and 10 days, as well as cocaine-induced locomotor activity as described below. Data of the 10 day Phenotyper measurement are not presented. In addition, female
rats 100-120 days of age were used to determine strain/
genotype levels of abdominal and subcutanenous WAT
(see below).
To generate the animals that were used in the genetic
modifier screen, five female outbred SERT-/- WI rats were
crossed with two male wild type inbred BN rats. The
resulting progeny (F1) was heterozygous for the SERT
knockout allele (SERT+/-) and heterozygous for BN/WI
polymorphisms. Brother-sister matings were conducted
among F1 animals to get an F2 generation consisting of
SERT-/-, SERT+/- and SERT+/+ rats that are homozygous or
heterozygous for BN and WI alleles (Additional file 1 Figure S1). The F2 generation was ear clipped at the age of
two weeks under isoflurane anesthesia, and 74 male
SERT-/-, 27 male SERT+/+, 38 female SERT-/- and 27
female SERT+/+ animals (Additional file 1 table S1) were
selected by SERT genotyping. The animals were weaned
at the age of three weeks, and housed two or three per
cage in standard Macrolon® type III cages with a shelter
and a piece of wood, in temperature controlled rooms
(21°C ± 2) and relative humidity of 60 ± 15% with standard 12 hour light/dark cycle (lights off at 6 p.m.) and
food and water ad libitum. The animals were weighted
and handled according to the scheme indicated in Additional file 1 table S9. 1 Week after behavioral testing, the
animals were sacrificed using CO2/O2, and ear cuts were
taken for SNP genotyping and reconfirmation of geno-

Page 8 of 11

types. Also after collection of the WAT ear cuts were
taken.
DNA isolation and SERT genotyping

Ear cuts from the animals were collected in 96 deep-well
plates. To each well 400 μL lysis buffer, containing 1 M
Tris HCL with pH 8, 5 M NaCl, 10%SDS, 0,5 mM EDTA,
and 100 mg/ml of freshly Proteinase K (from -20°C) was
added, the deep-well plate was sealed with heat seal and
incubated overnight at 55°C. After this the samples were
incubated at 80°C for 15 minutes, cooled down to room
temperature and to each well 300 μL isopropanol was
added. After sealing, the mix was inverted 10 times and
centrifuged at 3000 rcf for 40 minutes at 4°C. Then the
block was gently inverted to remove supernatant and the
pellets were washed by adding 400 μL 70% ethanol and
centrifuged at 3000 rcf for 15 minutes at 4°C. Again
supernatant was removed by inverting and the pellets
were air dried after which they were dissolved in 500 μL
H2O and stored at -20°C.
SNP genotyping

The generation of the rat SNP panel consisting of 324
SNPs that are homozygously polymorphic between WI
and BN and are evenly distributed over the genome is
described elsewhere [25]. This panel has been well validated; heterozygotes could be easily discerned from WI
and BN homozygous genotypes. Assay plates for genotyping by KASPar technology (Kbiosciences) containing
freeze-dried primers sets of the SNPs (two allele-specific
oligonucleotides of about 40 nt in length and 1 common
oligonucleotide of about 20 nt in length) stored at -20°C
were used. Each SNP was typed in a total volume of 4 μl
in the following reaction mixture: 6 ng DNA, 22 mM
MgCl2, KTaq, 1 μl 4× reaction mix, 2 μl pre-plated assay
mix according to the manufacturer's guidelines (Kbiosciences). Amplification was performed in Applied Biosystems GeneAmp 9700 thermocyclers running the
following program: 94°C - 15' then 20 cycles of 94°C-10",
57°C-5" and 72°C-10", followed by 18 cycles of 94°C-10",
57°C-20" and 72°C-40". Fluorescence scanning of the
reactions was done in a BMG labtech Pherastar scanner
and the results were interpreted by the KlusterCaller 1.1
software (KBiosciences). All SNPs for a single individual
were amplified in a single 384 well plate and afterwards
all raw data for each locus was regrouped for all samples
by a custom Perl script before interpretation by KlusterCaller.
Behavioral screen

The behavioral screen was performed in an automated
homecage behavior observation system (Rat Phenotyper®,
developed by Noldus Information Technology, Wageningen, The Netherlands). The cages (45 × 45 × 45 cm),

Homberg et al. BMC Genetics 2010, 11:37
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/11/37

made of transparent Perspex walls and a black floor, were
equipped with an empty feeding station and two holes for
drinking bottles. Each cage had a top unit containing a
built-in digital infrared-sensitive video camera, infrared
lighting sources, and hardware needed for video tracking
(Ethovision 3.0). Ethovision collects data at a rate of 5
samples per second. Four Phenotypers were connected to
a single PC.
With 16 Phenotypers up to 16 male rats were screened
simultaneously. Based on previous analyses of Wistar
SERT-/- and SERT+/+ behavior in the Phenotyper, a standardized test covering 13 days plus a comeback day was
designed (Additional file 1 table S9). All animals were
tested at the age of 62-80 days. 4 hours before the start of
the Phenotyper experiments the animals were transported to the Phenotyper test room. At 5 p.m., one hour
before the lights were turned off, the animals were placed
in the Phenotyper cages and housed in the cages during 3
days under a 12 hr day/light cycle, and thereafter during
10 days in continuous darkness. Following the 13 days of
Phenotyper testing the animals were transported back to
the experimental room in which they were previously
housed, and handled once a week thereafter, on fixed
days of age. Four weeks after the end of the Phenotyper
screen, the rats were brought back to the Phenotyper test
room, allowed to habituate to the room for two hrs and
tested in the Phenotyper cages at 11.00 a.m. without sawdust, food and water. Subsequently they were tested for
their locomotor response to cocaine according to the following scheme: 0-30 min: habituation; 30-60 min: i.p.
saline injection (1 ml/kg); 60-80 min: i.p. saline injection;
80-170 min: i.p. cocaine injection at 20 mg/kg. Overall,
environmental factors such as room temperature, humidity, day of experiment, cage enrichment, cage cleaning,
and sibship were as much as possible controlled and
noted in a diary.
WAT collection

During the mid-light phase, 100-120-days old female rats
were weighted and decapitated under isoflurane anesthesia. Abdominal WAT (mesenteric, perinephric and ovarian) and subcutaneous WAT were dissected, cleaned and
weighted.
Drugs

Cocaine was purchased from O.P.G. (Utrecht, The Netherlands), freshly dissolved in saline (20 mg/ml) 1 hour
before the experiment and administered in a volume of 1
ml/kg.
Data analysis

Behavioral performance in the Phenotyper was analysed
using Ethovision 3.1 software (Noldus Information Technology, Wageningen, The Netherlands). The parameters

Page 9 of 11

are: 1] Phenotyper (time in shelter, time in centre, total
distance moved, time spent on immobility, time spent on
mobility (15-60% change in body position between subsequent data samples), time spent on strong mobility (>60%
change in body position between subsequent data samples); 2] Cocaine-induced locomotor activity (time spent
in centre, distance moved 0-10 min, distance moved 1020 min, distance moved 30-120 min); 3] WAT (abdominal
and subcutaneous WAT). Parameters are also indicated
in Additional file 1 table S10. Abdominal and subcutaneous WAT weight was normalized by body weight, and
expressed as grams of WAT/100 grams of body weight
[23]. Because Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk
normality tests revealed a normal distribution of data,
behavioral and WAT parameters of the parental strains
were analysed using ANOVA. Subsequent postoc tests
were carried out with Bonferroni correction. A log10
transformation was used to obtain a normal distribution
of the F2 behavioral and WAT data, which were subsequently analysed using Student's T-test. Correlations
between phenotypes were calculated using Pearson's
product-moment correlation. Due to external noise that
influences the tracking signal during long trackings ~5%
data points of the 10-day continuous dark phase were
missing. Therefore, we did not include the 10-day continuous dark phase in the analysis. Although the same animals were used for the 3-day Phenotyper and cocaine
measurements, some animals were not included in the 3day Phenotyper assessments due to loss of data points
resulting from a hard-disk crash. All analyses were performed using SPSS 16.0 software package. Statistical significant effects were set at P < 0.05 (before Bonferroni
correction), and were adjusted using the Bonferroni
method (0.05/number of comparisons).
Composite interval mapping (CIM)

In order to detect mQTL regions we used a composite
interval mapping approach [47] using the Windows QTL
Cartographer package v2.5 [48]. The populations were
split based on their SERT genotype to reveal SERT-/- specific QTLs. Several thousand permutation runs (see table
1) were performed to determine the genome wide significance levels (GWSL) for each trait and the resulting
thresholds were used to determine significant peaks.
Candidate gene search

To explore candidate genes within QTL regions we used
the BioMart tool of the Ensembl Genome Browser (see
http://www.ensembl.org). We used the Ensembl 54 database for Rattus Norvegicus genes RGSC3.4, and used
genomic regions around the associated markers and used
the adjacent non-significant makers as limits. Using the
Rat Genome Database http://www.rgd.mcw.edu we also

explored whether SERT-/--linked QTLs that were identified in this study match known QTLs.
