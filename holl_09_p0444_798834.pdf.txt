Background
Immune responses to HIV-1 rarely generate broadly crossreactive, neutralizing antibodies (NAb). Some NAbs are
polyreactive and bind self-antigens, suggesting that effective humoral responses to some HIV-1 antigens are constrained by tolerization of NAb B cells.

Methods
The human HIV-1 NAb 2F5 was used to identify human
and mouse self-antigens that cross-react with the gp41
MPER. Mouse B cells were generated absent the tolerizing
environment of bone marrow (BM) in sequential cultures
of non-adherent progenitor cells containing rIL-7, and
later, rBAFF. RAG1-deficient mice were reconstituted with
culture derived (CD) B and T cells (CD-RAG mice); 4 wks
later serum immunoglobulin and autoantibody were
quantified. CD-RAG and control mice were immunized
with HIV-1 gp-41 MPER antigen in alum adjuvant; germinal center (GC) and antibody responses were determined
2 weeks after primary or boost immunizations.

RAG mice elicited strong (4-fold higher) GC responses
and ~30-fold more MPER IgG antibody.

Conclusion
The 2F5 NAb binds to phylogenetically conserved nuclear
antigens, consistent with the hypothesis that HIV-1 evades
humoral immunity by exploiting immunological tolerance. We show that transitional B cells generated in vitro
are enriched for autoreactive cells which survive and
reconstitute serum antibody in vivo. Immunization of
autoimmune CD-RAG mice with an MPER antigen results
in significantly higher GC and antibody responses compared to intact controls. The CD-RAG mouse is a novel
model for investigating ''forbidden'' humoral responses to
HIV-1 antigens.

Results
The 2F5 NAb binds to nuclear antigens in both uninfected
human and mouse cells. BM and CD transitional B cells
are enriched for reactivity to self and to an MPER antigen.
Sera of CD-RAG and control mice have similar IgM/IgG
serum levels but autoantibody titers are greatly elevated in
CD-RAG animals. MPER antigen was weakly immunogenic in C57BL/6 mice, but MPER immunization of CD-
