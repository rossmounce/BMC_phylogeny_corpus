Results: Using a sensitive DNA-microarray platform and 25 sampling timepoints, we reveal the
genome-scale transcriptional basis of the Clostridium acetobutylicum sporulation program carried
deep into stationary phase. A significant fraction of the genes displayed temporal expression in six
distinct clusters of expression, which were analyzed with assistance from ontological classifications
in order to illuminate all known physiological observations and differentiation stages of this
industrial organism. The dynamic orchestration of all known sporulation sigma factors was
investigated, whereby in addition to their transcriptional profiles, both in terms of intensity and
differential expression, their activity was assessed by the average transcriptional patterns of
putative canonical genes of their regulon. All sigma factors of unknown function were investigated
by combining transcriptional data with predicted promoter binding motifs and antisense-RNA
downregulation to provide a preliminary assessment of their roles in sporulation. Downregulation
of two of these sigma factors, CAC1766 and CAP0167, affected the developmental process of
sporulation and are apparently novel sporulation-related sigma factors.
Conclusion: This is the first detailed roadmap of clostridial sporulation, the most detailed
transcriptional study ever reported for a strict anaerobe and endospore former, and the first
reported holistic effort to illuminate cellular physiology and differentiation of a lesser known
organism.

Background

Clostridia are of major importance to human and animal
health and physiology, cellulose degradation, bioremediation, and for the production of biofuels and chemicals from
renewable resources [1]. These obligate anaerobic, Grampositive, endospore-forming firmicutes include several major
human and animal pathogens, such as C. botulinum, C. perfringens, C. difficile, and C. tetani, the cellulolytic C. thermocellum and C. phytofermentans, several ethanologenic [2],
and many solventogenic (butanol, acetone and ethanol) species [3]. Their sporulation/differentiation program is critical
for understanding important cellular functions or programs,
yet it remains largely unknown. We have recently examined
the similarity of the clostridia and bacilli sporulation programs using information from sequenced clostridial genomes
[1]. We concluded that, based on genomic information alone,
the two programs are substantially different, reflecting the
different evolutionary age and roles of these two genera. We
have also argued that C. acetobutylicum is a good model
organism for all clostridia [1]. Transcriptional or functional
genomic information is, however, necessary for detailing
these differences and for understanding clostridial differentiation and physiology. Key issues awaiting resolution include:
the identification of the mid to late sigma and sporulation factors and their regulons; the orchestration and timing of their
action; the set of genes employed by the cells in the mid and
late stages of spore maturation; identification of candidate
histidine kinases that might be capable of phosphorylating
the master regulator (Spo0A) of sporulation; and some functional assessment of the roles of several sigma factors of
unknown function encoded by the C. acetobutylicum
genome. Furthermore, an understanding of the transcriptional basis of the complex physiology of this organism will go
a long way to improve our ability to metabolically engineer,
for practical applications, its complex sporulation and metabolic programs. Such information generates tremendous new
opportunities for further exploration of this complex anaerobe and its clostridial relatives, and constitutes a firm basis
for future detailed genetic and functional studies.
Using a limited in scope and resolution transcriptional study,
we have previously shown that it is possible to use DNAmicroarray-based transcriptional analysis to generate valuable functional information related to stress response [4,5],
initiation of sporulation [6] and the early sporulation program of C. acetobutylicum [7]. In order to be able to accurately study the transcriptional orchestration underlying the
complete sporulation program of the cells, it was necessary to
develop a more sensitive and accurate microarray platform, a
better mRNA isolation protocol (in order to isolate RNA from
the mid and late stationary phases), as well as to use a much
higher frequency of observation and sampling. We also aimed
to employ more sophisticated bioinformatic tools in order to
globally interrogate any desirable cellular program and relate
it to the characteristic phenotypic metabolism and sporulation of this organism. The results of this extensive study are

presented here as a single, undivided story, which offers
unprecedented insights and a tremendous wealth of information for further explorations. Furthermore, it serves as a paradigm of what can be effectively accomplished with the now
highly accurate DNA-microarray analysis in generating a
robust transcriptional roadmap and in illuminating the physiology of a lesser understood organism.

Results and discussion
Metabolism and differentiation of C. acetobutylicum:
identification of a new cell type?
We aimed to relate the metabolic and morphological characteristics of the cells in a typical batch culture, whereby cells
underwent a full differentiation program, to the transcriptional profile of the cell population [8]. The metabolism of
solventogenic clostridia is characterized by an initial acidogenic phase followed by acid re-assimilation and solvent production [7]. As shown in Figure 1a, the peak of butyrate
concentration, around 16 hours after the start of the culture,
coincided with the initiation of butanol production. Around
this time, the culture transitioned from exponential growth to
stationary phase and initiated solventogenesis and sporulation. This period is called the transitional phase and is indicated by the gray bar in Figure 1a and all following figures.
The butanol concentration increased to over 150 mM until
hour 45, after which no substantial change in solvent or acid
concentration took place. Nevertheless, cells continued to
display morphological changes well past hour 60. Solventogenic clostridia display a series of morphological forms over
this differentiation program: vegetative, clostridial, forespore, endospore, and free-spore forms [9]. In addition to
phase-contrast microscopy, we found that by using Syto-9 (a
green dye assumed to stain live cells) and propidium iodide
(PI; a red dye assumed to stain dead cells) [10] we could
microscopically distinguish these morphologies and identify
new cell subtypes. Staining by these two dyes did not follow
typical expectations. During exponential growth, vegetative
cells, characterized by a thin-rod morphology, were visibly
motile under the microscope, which is consistent with the
finding that chemotaxis and motility genes were highly
expressed during this time [7]. When double stained with
Syto-9 and PI dyes, these vegetative cells took on a predominantly red color, indicating the uptake of more PI than Syto9 (Figure 1b, I, II). At the onset of butanol production, swollen, cigar-shaped clostridial-form cells began to appear (Figure 1b, III). These clostridial forms (confirmed by phasecontrast microscopy; data not shown), generally assumed to
be the cells that produce solvents [8], were far less motile
than exponential-phase cells and stained almost equally with
both dyes, taking on an orange color. Clostridial forms persisted until solvent production decreased, after which forespore forms (cells with one end swollen, which is indicative of
a spore forming) and endospore forms (cells with the middle
swollen, which is indicative of a developing spore) became
visible [9]. These cells stained almost exclusively green,

indicating an uptake of more Syto-9 than PI (Figure 1b, IVVI). The sporulation process is completed when the mother
cell undergoes autolysis to release the mature spore. Mature
free spores could be seen as early as hour 44 (Figure 1b, V).
Later, around hour 58 (Figure 1b, VI), a portion of the cells
became motile again. Though these cells appear like vegetative cells, they stained predominantly green, instead of red,
and did not produce appreciable amounts of acid. We hypothesize that this staining change reflects modifications in membrane composition due to different environmental conditions
(presence of solvents and other metabolites) rather than cell
viability and assume that this newly identified cell type has
different transcriptional characteristics, which we tested
next.

To ensure that important transcriptional, physiological, and

were taken every hour during exponential phase and every
two hours after that until late stationary phase when sampling frequency decreased. mRNA from 25 timepoints (Figure 1a) were selected for transcriptional analysis by
hybridizing pairs of 22k oligonucleotide microarrays on a dye
swap configuration using an mRNA pool as reference. There
were 814 genes, or 21% of the genome, that surpassed the

expressed at a 95% confidence level [11]; these genes were
classified as having a temporal differential expression profile.
We chose these strict selection criteria in order to robustly
identify the key expression patterns of the differentiation
process. We relaxed these criteria in subsequent gene ontology-driven analyses. Expression data were extensively validated by, first, quantitative reverse transcription PCR (Q-RTPCR) analysis (focusing on key sporulation factors) from a

scriptional changes in larger functional groups (for example,
transcription, motility, translation), each cluster was analyzed according to the Cluster of Orthologous Groups of
proteins (COG) classification [12] and the functional genome
annotation [13]. To determine if a COG functional group was
overrepresented in any of the K-means clusters, first the percentage of each group in the genome was determined, and
then the percentage of each group was determined in each of
the K-means clusters. By comparing the percentage in the Kmeans clusters to the genome percentage, we could identify
overrepresented groups (Additional data file 2).

Exponential phase: motility, chemotaxis, nucleotide and primary
metabolism
The first cluster contains 134 genes highly expressed during
exponential growth (hours 6 to 10; see Additional data file 2
for a list of the genes). This cluster characterizes highly motile
vegetative cells (Figure 1b, I) and, given the minimal amount
of knowledge on the genes responsible for motility and chemotaxis in clostridia, our analysis offers the possibility of identifying these genes at the genome scale [14]. This cluster
includes the flagella structural components flagellin and flbD,
the main chemotaxis response regulator, cheY (CAC0122;
responsible for flagellar rotation in B. subtilis [15]), as well as
several methyl-accepting chemotaxis receptor genes
(CAC0432, CAC0443, CAC0542, CAC1600, CAP0048). COG
analysis showed that genes related to cell motility (COG class
N) and nucleotide transport and metabolism (COG class F)
were overrepresented in this cluster (Additional data file 2).
In order to investigate cell motility further, all genes that fell
within this COG class were hierarchically clustered according
to their expression profiles (see Additional data file 3 for Figure S2 and discussion). Interestingly, the two main cell motility gene clusters, the first including most of the flagellar
assembly and motor proteins and the second containing most
of the known chemotaxis proteins, clustered together and displayed a bimodal expression pattern (Figure S2). The genes
were not only expressed during exponential phase but also
during late stationary phase, around hour 38, which is consistent with the observation that a motile cell population was
again observed in late stationary phase. Included in the category of nucleotide transport and metabolism are several
purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis genes: a set of five consecutive genes, purECFMN, the bi-functional purQ/L gene,
purA, pyrPR, pyrD, and pyrI. Two other purine synthesis
genes (purH, purD) showed very similar profiles but were not
classified within this cluster by the clustering algorithm. Vegetative cells, which correspond to this cluster, produce ATP
through acidogenesis, whereby the cells uptake glucose and
convert it to acetic and butyric acid. Because glucose is the
main energy source, multiple genes for glucose transport
were included within this cluster, including the glucose-specific phosphotransferase gene, ptsG, the glucose kinase glcK
and CAP0131, the gene most similar to B. subtilis glucose permease glcP. The genes required for the metabolism of glucose
to pyruvate did not show temporal regulation, suggesting that

Volume 9, Issue 7, Article R114

Jones et al. R114.5

expression of these genes is constitutive-like (see Additional
data file 3 for Figure S3 and discussion). Acetic acid production genes pta and ack were not temporally expressed, but
butyrate production genes ptb and buk were. Though
expressed throughout exponential phase, the expression of
both ptb and buk slightly peaked during late exponential
phase, as previously seen [7], and thus fall in the transitional
(second) cluster. Analysis of the expression patterns of all the
genes involved in acidogenesis, not just the differentially
expressed genes discussed here, is included in Figure S3 in
Additional data file 3. Finally, the expression patterns of the
two classes of hydrogenases (iron only and nickel-iron) were
investigated (Figure S3 in Additional data file 3). hydA, the
iron only hydrogenase that catalyzes the production of molecular hydrogen, was expressed only during exponential phase,
whereas the iron-nickel hydrogenase, mbhS and mbhL, was
expressed throughout stationary phase.

Initiation of sporulation: abrB, sinR, lipid and iron metabolism
The transitional phase is captured by 139 genes in the second
cluster (Figure 1c,d; Additional data file 2). It is made up of
genes that show elevated expression between hours 10 and 18
and is when solvent formation was initiated. This cluster
characterizes the shift from vegetative cells to cells committing to sporulation and thus includes two important regulators of sporulation, abrB (CAC0310) and sinR (CAC0549),
which are discussed in more detail below. Also characteristic
of this shift from vegetative growth to sporulation was the
overrepresentation of genes related to energy production and
conversion (COG class C), since sporulation is an energy
intensive process. Solvent production began in the transitional phase, though the genes responsible for solvent production fall in the next (third) cluster; the third cluster
partially overlaps with this second cluster but is distinguished
by a sustained expression pattern. In response to these solvents, C. acetobutylicum undergoes a change in its membrane composition and fluidity, generally decreasing the ratio
between unsaturated to saturated fatty acids [16-18]. Consistent with this change, genes related to lipid metabolism (COG
class I) were overrepresented in this cluster. To further investigate this COG class, all genes identified as COG class I were
hierarchically clustered (see Additional data file 3 for Figure
S4 and discussion). Seven genes that were upregulated just
before the onset of sporulation fall within the same operon
and are related to fatty acid synthesis. In contrast, many of
the most characterized genes involved in fatty acid synthesis
(accBC, fabDFZ, and acp) maintain a fairly flat profile
throughout the timecourse (Figure S4 in Additional data file
3). Also within this cluster is the gene responsible for cyclopropane fatty acid synthesis (cfa), though classified in COG
class M (cell envelope biogenesis) and not COG class I.
Importantly, the ratio of cyclopropane fatty acids in the outer
membrane has been shown to increase as cells enter stationary phase [18,19], but the overexpression of this gene alone
was unable to produce a solvent tolerant strain [19]. Though
not overrepresented in this cluster, all the genes within COG

Genome Biology 2008, 9:R114

http://genomebiology.com/2008/9/7/R114

Genome Biology 2008,

class M were also hierarchically clustered (see Additional data
file 3 for Figure S5 and discussion). The transitional cluster
also included several genes related to iron transport and
regulation like the fur family iron uptake regulator CAC2634,
the iron permease CAC0788, feoA, feoB, fhuC, and two ironregulated transporters (CAC3288, CAC3290), which is consistent with the earlier, more limited data [7]. Significantly,
iron-limitation has been found to promote solventogenesis
[20].

Solventogenesis, clostridial form, stress proteins, and early sigma
factors
The third cluster (Figure 1c,d; Additional data file 2) of 175
upregulated genes represents the solventogenic/stationary
phase as it contains all key solventogenic genes. This cluster
characterizes the transcriptional pattern of clostridial cells,
the unique developmental stage in clostridia and first
recognizable cell type of the sporulation cascade, and exhibited a longer upregulation of gene expression than the previous two clusters. Indeed, its range overlapped the previous
(second) and the next two (fourth and fifth) clusters. The
clostridial form is generally recognized to be the form responsible for solvent production [8,21] and is distinguished morphologically as swollen cell forms with phase bright granulose
within the cell [21]. This cluster captures both of these characteristics with the inclusion of the solventogenic genes and
several granulose formation genes. The solventogenic genes
adhE1-ctfA-ctfB, adc, and bdhB were initially induced during
transitional phase, the second cluster, but were expressed
throughout stationary phase and were thus placed within this
cluster. Two granulose formation genes, glgC (CAC2237) and
CAC2240, and a granulose degradation gene, glgP
(CAC1664), were included within this cluster. The other two
granulose formation genes, glgD (CAC2238) and glgA
(CAC2239), though not included in this cluster, displayed a
similar expression profile to glgC and CAC2240. The concomitant requirement of NADH during butanol production
drove the expression of three genes involved in NAD formation: nadABC. Expression of the stress-response gene hsp18,
a heat-shock related chaperone, and the ctsR-yacH-yacIclpC operon, containing the molecular chaperone clpC and
the stress-gene repressor ctsR, also fell in this cluster and paralleled the expression of the solventogenic genes (see Additional data file 3 for Figure S6). Other important stressresponse genes, groEL-groES (CAC2703-04) and hrcAgrpE-dnaK-dnaJ (CAC1280-83), mirrored this expression
pattern, though were not differentially expressed according to
the strict criteria employed for selecting the genes of Figure
2c,d (Figure S6 in Additional data file 3). Although genes
encoded on the pSOL1 megaplasmid [22] represent less than
5% of the genome, they constitute 15% of genes in this cluster.
pSOL1 harbors all essential solvent-formation genes and,
importantly, some unknown gene(s) essential for sporulation
[22]. Besides the genes listed in this cluster, the vast majority
of the genes located on pSOL1 were expressed throughout stationary phase, with most being upregulated at the onset of

solventogenesis (see Additional data file 3 for Figure S7). Several key sporulation-specific sigma factors (σF, σE, σG) and the
σF-associated anti-sigma factors in the form of the tricistronic
spoIIA operon (CAC2308-06) belong to this cluster along
with one of the two paralogs of spoVS (CAC1750) and one of
three spoVD paralogs (CAP0150). The second spoVS paralog
(CAC1817) did not meet the threshold of expression in 12 of
the 25 timepoints; the other two paralogs of spoVD
(CAC0329, CAC2130) were above the expression cutoff but
did not show significant temporal regulation. Of unknown
significance was the expression of a large cluster of genes
involved in the biosynthesis of the branched-chain amino
acids valine, leucine and isoleucine (CAC3169-74) coinciding
with the onset of solventogenesis, as shown before [7,23], as
well as the upregulation of several glycosyltranferases (see
Additional data file 3 for Figure S8). The upregulation of
valine, leucine, and isoleucine synthesis genes could be indicative of a membrane fluidity adaptation [7]. In B. subtilis,
these branched-chain amino acids can be converted into
branched-chain fatty acids and change the membrane fluidity
[24], and under cold shock stress, B. subtilis downregulates a
number of genes related to valine, leucine, and isoleucine synthesis [25]. Therefore, this upregulation may be another
mechanism to change membrane fluidity, though the ratio of
unbranched and branched fatty acids has not been reported
in studies investigating membrane composition [16-18,26].

Stationary phase carbohydrate (beyond glucose) and amino acid
metabolism
The fourth cluster (Figure 1c,d; Additional data file 2) of 84
genes represents a sharp induction of expression between 18
and 24 hours (early stationary phase). This cluster falls within
the stationary (third) cluster described above. This is a compact group, with 70% belonging to one of three COG categories: carbohydrate transport and metabolism, transport and
metabolism of amino acids, and inorganic ion transport and
metabolism. A number of different carbohydrate substrate
pathways, from monosaccharides (fructose, galactose, mannose, and xylose) to disaccharides (lactose, maltose, and
sucrose) to complex carbohydrates (cellulose, glycogen,
starch, and xylan), were investigated, and many exhibited
upregulation during stationary phase, though only a few are
highly expressed (see Additional data file 3 for Figure S9).
The significance of this upregulation of non-glucose pathways
is unknown, because sufficient glucose remains in the media
(approximately 200 mM or about 44% of the initial glucose
level). Of particular interest was the upregulation of several
genes related to starch and xylan degradation (Figure S9 in
Additional data file 3). The two annotated α-amylases
(CAP0098 and CAP0168) along with the less characterized
glucosidases and glucoamylase were all upregulated throughout stationary phase and a number were highly expressed,
like CAC2810 and CAP0098. Also upregulated were the predicted xylanases CAC2383, CAP0054, and CAC1037, with
CAP0054 and CAC1037 being highly expressed during stationary phase. Mirroring this pattern were CAC1086, a xylose

associated transcriptional regulator, and the highly expressed
CAC2612, a xylulose kinase. The genes related to glycogen
metabolism are believed to be involved in granulose
formation, as discussed earlier. Several genes for arginine
biosynthesis (argF, argGH, argDB, argCJ, carB) were
induced during this time, probably as a result of its depletion
in the culture medium.

ing microscopy and demonstrate they have a different genetic
profile compared to the early vegetative cells. Interestingly,
this cluster is enriched in defense mechanism genes (COG
class V) like a phospholipase (CAC3026) and multidrug
transporters that may play a role in resistance to a variety of
environmental toxins.

General processes: cell division and ribosomal proteins
Genes underlying the activation of the sporulation machinery and the
genes for tryptophan and histidine biosynthesis
The fifth cluster (Figure 1c,d; Additional data file 2), representing the middle stationary phase, contains 120 genes
mainly expressed between hours 24 and 36, and again falls
within the stationary (third) cluster described above. Most of
the genes in this cluster activate the sporulation-related
sigma factors (σF, σE, σG) or are putatively regulated by them.
These include spoIIE, the phosphatase that dephosphorylates
SpoIIAA and results in the activation of σF, and the σEdependent operons spoVR (involved in cortex synthesis),
spoIIIAA-AH (required for the activation of σG), and spoIVA
(involved in cortex formation and spore coat assembly). The
σG-dependent spoVT gene has two paralogs in C. acetobutylicum (CAC3214, CAC3649); the transcriptional pattern suggests that CAC3214, included in this cluster, is the real spoVT.
Sporulation-related genes included in this cluster are three
cotF genes, one cotJ gene, one cotS gene, the spore maturation protein B, a small acid soluble protein (CAC2365), and
two spore lytic enzymes (CAC0686, CAC3244). Though several sporulation-related genes are included in the next (sixth)
cluster as well, most, beyond those listed here, are upregulated in mid-stationary phase (see Additional data file 3 for
Figure S10 and discussion). Seven genes of the putative
operon (CAC3157-63) encoding genes for tryptophan synthesis from chorismate and ten genes for histidine synthesis
(CAC0935-43, CAC3031) were also included here.

Spore maturation and late-stationary phase vegetative cells
The sixth cluster, representative of the late stationary phase,
includes 162 genes mainly expressed after hour 36 (Figure
1c,d; Additional data file 2). This cluster captured the expression profiles of the forespore and endospore forms, free
spores, and late-stage vegetative-like cells. The endospore
form represents the last stage before mature spores are
released, and therefore fewer sporulation-related genes are
within this cluster than previous ones. The sporulationrelated genes included in this cluster are two small acid-soluble proteins (CAC1522 and CAC2372), a spore germination
protein (CAC3302), a spore coat biosynthesis protein
(CAC2190) and a spore protease (CAC1275). Also within this
cluster are the two phosphotransferase genes, CAC2958 (a
galactitol-specific transporter) and CAC2965 (a lactose-specific transporter), another annotated cheY (CAC2218), various enzymes related to different sugar pathways (CAC2180,
CAC2250, CAC2954), and two glycosyltransferases
(CAC2172, CAC3049). Expression of these genes may be
reflective of the late-stage vegetative-like cells observed dur-

Two additional gene classes (cell division and ribosomal proteins), though not overrepresented in any of the six clusters
described above, were investigated because of their importance in cellular processes and interesting expression patterns. COG class D (cell division and chromosome
partitioning), besides important genes for vegetative symmetric division, includes ftsAZ, important for both symmetric
and asymmetric cell division, and soj (a regulator of spo0J)
and spoIIIE, important for proper chromosomal partitioning
between the mother cell and prespore. These genes, along
with several uncharacterized genes, were upregulated at the
beginning of sporulation (see Additional data file 3 for Figure
S11). Almost all the ribosomal proteins were downregulated
as the culture entered stationary phase, and interestingly,
about half of those downregulated genes were again upregulated in mid-stationary phase and remained upregulated until
late-stationary phase (see Additional data file 3 for Figure
S12). This upregulation is likely related to the late-stage vegetative-like cells seen.

Expression and activity patterns of sporulation-related
sigma factors and related genes
Expression of sporulation transcription factors
Sporulation in bacilli is initiated by a multi-component phosphorelay [27], which is absent in clostridia, but the master
regulator of sporulation, Spo0A, is conserved [1,13]. Briefly,
in B. subtilis, phosphorylated Spo0A promotes the expression
of prespore-specific sigma factor σF and mother cell-specific
sigma factor σE [28]. σF is followed by σG, which is controlled
by both σF and σE, and σE is followed by σK, which is controlled by σE and SpoIIID [28]. sigH expression, in bacilli, is
induced before the onset of sporulation and aids spo0A transcription [28]. Here, sigH expression underwent a modest
two-fold induction, relative to the first timepoint, during the
onset of sporulation but never increased beyond three-fold, in
contrast to all other sporulation factors (Figure 3a). spo0A
expression also peaked during the onset of sporulation at over
12-fold and maintained a minimum of 3-fold induction until
hour 36 (Figure 3a,b). Once phosphorylated, in bacilli and
likely in C. acetobutylicum [29], Spo0A regulates the expression of the operons encoding sigF, sigE, and spoIIE [30], the
latter of which acts as an activator of σF. sigF and sigE exhibited an initial 16- and 8-fold induction, respectively, at hour
12, the timing of peak spo0A expression, but a second higher
level of induction, 46- and 66-fold, respectively, was reached
later at hour 24 (Figure 3c) and confirmed with Q-RT-PCR
(Figure 2). The plateau or decrease in expression of spo0A,
sigF, and sigE coincided with the peak expression of two

Deduced activity profiles of sporulation factors
We also desired to estimate the activity profiles for the key
sporulation factors (σH, Spo0A, σF, σE, and σG; Figure 4). We
did so by averaging the expression profiles of known or
robustly identifiable canonical genes of their regulons [1]. To
adjust for differences in relative expression levels, expression
profiles were standardized before averaging [7]. This is a surrogate reporter assay, which we believe is as accurate as most
reporter assays. For a detailed discussion of the genes used to
construct the plots, see Additional data file 4. For all of the
plots (Figure 4), peak activity took place after peak expression, as expected. Of all the factors, σH activity peaked first,
during early transitional phase, and this was followed by a
decrease in activity until stationary phase, when activity
increased again (Figure 4a,f). Spo0A~P activity was the next
to peak, during late transitional phase, and stayed fairly con-

known repressors, abrB and sinR, of sporulation genes in B.
subtilis (Figure 3b), the former repressing the expression of
spo0A promoters and the latter directly binding to the
promoter sequences of the spo0A, sigF, and sigE operons
[31,32]. C. acetobutylicum contains three paralogs of abrB,
among which CAC0310 exhibited the highest promoter activity and, when downregulated, causes delayed sporulation and
decreased solvent formation [33]. sinR (CAC0549) expression in C. acetobutylicum was previously reported [33] to be
weak, but our data show a significant amount of expression
and suggest a similar role as that in B. subtilis. In B. subtilis,
Spo0A either indirectly (sinR) or directly (abrB) represses
the genes of these two repressors [32,34]. The expression patterns of both genes did decrease after peak Spo0A~P deduced
activity (Figure 4b; see below), indicating a similar regulatory
network may be involved in C. acetobutylicum. sigF, sigE and
sigG have very similar expression patterns (Figure 3c). Both
sigF and sigE are activated by Spo0A~P, so similar expression profiles were expected. In B. subtilis, a sigG transcript is
also detected early, but this transcript is read-through from
sigE, located immediately upstream of sigG, and is not translated [35,36]. Translation of sigG occurs when the gene is
expressed as a single cistron from a σF-dependent promoter
located between sigE and sigG [35,36]. In C. acetobutylicum,
sigE and sigG are also located adjacent to each other, but a σF
promoter was not predicted between the two genes [37].
Thus, it was predicted that sigG is only expressed as part of
the sigE operon (consisting of spoIIGA, the processing
enzyme for σE, and sigE). Our transcriptional data seem to
support this prediction because all three genes, spoIIGA,
sigE, and sigG, have very similar transcriptional patterns
(Figure 3f), suggesting they are expressed as a single transcript, like the spoIIAA-spoIIAB-sigF operon (Figure 3e).
However, from Northern blots probing against sigE-sigG,
three separate transcripts were seen: one for spoIIGA-sigEsigG, one for spoIIGA-sigE, and one for sigG [29]. Unfortunately, the current data cannot resolve this issue definitively,
since the microarrays only detect if a transcript is present or
not.

stant throughout the rest of the timecourse (Figure 4b,f). σF
activity had an initial induction during transitional phase, but
then stayed constant until 24 hours (Figure 4c,f). After 24
hours, the activity increased again and stayed fairly constant
at this higher activity level for the rest of the culture. σE activity increased slightly during late transitional phase, but its
major increase occurred after 24 hours during mid-stationary
phase (Figure 4d,f). Like the previous sigma factors, σG activity increased throughout early stationary phase and early
mid-stationary phase, but the major increase occurred after
hour 30 (Figure 4e,f). The activity of all of the factors, except
for Spo0A and σF, decreased during late stationary phase at
hour 38. σG activity began to increase slightly again at hour 48
but did not peak again. Considering only major peaks in activity, the Bacillus model of sporulation is generally true with

Can we deduce the activation and processing of σF, σE, and σG from
transcriptional data?
In B. subtilis, the sigma factors downstream of Spo0A (σF, σE,
and σG) are all regulated by a complex network of interactions
[1]. We desired to examine if our transcriptional data could be
used to do a first test to determine whether the mechanisms
employed in the B. subtilis model are valid for C. acetobutylicum. In B. subtilis, σF is held inactive in the pre-divisional
cell by the anti-σF factor SpoIIAB. σF is released when the
anti-anti-σF factor SpoIIAA is dephosphorylated by SpoIIE,
resulting in SpoIIAA binding to SpoIIAB, which then releases

σF. In C. acetobutylicum, spoIIAB (CAC2307) and spoIIAA
(CAC2308) are transcribed on the same operon as sigF (Figure 3e), but spoIIE (CAC3205) is transcribed separately. The
initial increase in σF activity during the transitional phase was
not accompanied by an increase in spoIIE expression, but the
peak in σF activity did occur after spoIIE upregulation (Figure
4c). Despite the sustained level of σF activity, sigF and spoIIE
decreased in expression, though spoIIE expression did
increase slightly again after 48 hours (Figure 4c). In B. subtilis, the pro-σE translated from the sigE gene undergoes
processing from SpoIIGA, which must interact with SpoIIR in
order to accomplish the σE activation. In C. acetobutylicum,
SpoIIGA (CAC1694) is transcribed on the same operon as
sigE (Figure 3f), and SpoIIR is coded by CAC2898. σE activity
increased with the induction of spoIIR (Figure 4d), suggesting a similar mechanism as in B. subtilis. Finally, σG activation in B. subtilis is dependent upon the eight genes within
the spoIIIA operon. Here, the second and larger increase in
σG activity followed peak expression of the spoIIIA operon,
but the early increase in σG activity was not characterized by a
large induction of spoIIIA expression (Figure 4e). We tentatively conclude that the B. subtilis processing and activation
model does generally hold true in C. acetobutylicum, but further investigation is needed to determine the exact timing and
interaction of the various factors and their activators.

Is there a functional sigK?
In B. subtilis, σK is formed by splicing together two genes
(spoIVCB and spoIIIC), both under the control of σE and
SpoIIID [38], separated by a skin element [39]. In contrast, a
single gene encoding σK has been annotated in C.
acetobutylicum [13]. The gene was initially identified using a
PCR-approach [40] and was later detected by primer extension in a phosphate-limited, continuous culture of C. acetobutylicum DSM 1731 [41]. spoIIID, which controls sigK
expression with σE in B. subtilis, reached peak expression at
hour 30, which is consistent with it being under σE control
(Figure 3d) [42]. However, at no timepoint in this study did
sigK exceed the cutoff expression criterion. Q-RT-PCR also
showed a significantly lower sigK induction compared to the
other sigma factors and suggests the transcript, if expressed,
is at much lower levels than any other gene analyzed (Figure
2). The putative main σK processing enzyme, SpoIVFB
(CAC1253), also did not exceed the cutoff criterion. To help
determine if there is an active σK, we investigated two genes
controlled by σK in B. subtilis. yabG (CAC2905), which
encodes a protein involved in spore coat assembly, was upregulated mid-stationary phase and peaked at hour 30 (Figure
3d), and spsF (CAC2190), involved in spore coat synthesis,
was not upregulated until late stationary phase, at hour 38
(Figure 3d). From these two genes, it is difficult to determine
whether a functional sigK gene exists or not. Clearly they are
both transcribed, but based on its expression pattern, yabG
could fall under the control of σE instead of σK. spsF upregulation is late enough to possibly indicate σK regulation though.
Ideally, more genes need to be investigated to draw firmer

conclusions, but because few σK regulon homologs exist in C.
acetobutylicum, we cannot currently determine if there is σK
activity or not.

Distinct profiles of sensory histidine kinases: which for
Spo0A?
Revisiting the orphan kinases
As discussed, phosphorylated Spo0A is responsible for initiating sporulation in both bacilli and clostridia along with solvent formation in C. acetobutylicum. In bacilli, Spo0A is
phosphorylated via a multi-component phosphorelay [43],
initiated by five orphan histidine kinases, KinA-E (kinases
that lack an adjacent response regulator); this phosphorelay
system is absent in all sequenced clostridia [1]. Alternatively,
Spo0A in clostridia may be directly phosphorylated by a histidine kinase, orphan or not, as was hypothesized in [1,7].
This alternative was demonstrated in C. botulinum, where the
orphan kinase CBO1120 was able to phosphorylate Spo0A
[44]. In C. acetobutylicum, five true orphan kinases have
been identified with a sixth orphan, CAC2220, identified as
CheA, which has a known response regulator [1].
A kinase that could directly phosphorylate Spo0A is expected
to have a peak in expression before or during the activation of
Spo0A, as the orphan kinases in B. subtilis do [45-47]. As a
measure of Spo0A activity, the expression of the sol operon
(CAP0162-64) was used, as before [7], because it is induced
by Spo0A~P. The initial induction of the sol operon, almost
100-fold, occured at hour 10 (before spo0A reached it maximum expression), with detectable levels of butanol appearing
before the second induction of the sol operon. This second
induction, of another 10-fold, followed the peak in spo0A
expression (Figure 5a). It is clear that some level of phosphorylated Spo0A exists at 10 hours; therefore, kinase candidates
must display an increase in expression before 10 hours. Of the
five orphan kinases (Figure 5b,c), CAC2730 displayed the earliest peak followed by CAC0437, CAC0903, and CAC3319.
CAC0323 never displayed a prominent peak in expression
either before or after sol operon induction (Figure 5b) and
likely does not play a role in phosphorylating Spo0A. Of the
remaining four, CAC0437 and CAC2730 peaked only once
before the initial sol operon induction, while CAC0903
peaked before each induction of the sol operon (Figure 5b,c).
CAC3319 expression slightly mirrored that of the sol operon,
with an increase before initial induction followed by a plateau, and an increase in expression again until it peaked just
after the sol operon peaked (Figure 5c). The proteins encoded
by CAC0437 and CA0903 displayed the most similarity to the
protein encoded by CBO1120, the orphan kinase in C. botulinum shown to phosphorylate Spo0A [44].

Non-orphan kinase expression
Though primarily interested in orphan kinases because of the
similarity to the B. subtilis model, a two-component response
system could also be responsible for the phosphorylation of
Spo0A. The remaining 30 annotated histidine kinases were

also investigated to determine if any displayed a peak in
expression before the initial induction of the sol operon
(Additional data file 5). Six kinases (Figure 5d,e) were found
to have a peak in expression at 8 hours. CAC0290 and
CAC3430 subsequently decreased in expression while
CAC0225 and CAC0863 maintained expression at initial levels. Despite a dip in expression at hour 9, CAC1582 maintained an increased expression level from 8 hours on.
CAC2434 peaked at hour 8, dropped back to initial levels, but
then steadily increased with the second induction of the sol
operon.

Sigma factors of unknown function: a first assessment
of their functional roles
Seventeen sigma factors are annotated on the C. acetobutylicum genome, including two on pSOL1. Two, sigK (CAC1689)
and CAC1770 (a sigK-like sigma factor), are expressed at very

low levels and two others, CAC1509 (annotated 'specialized
sigma subunit of RNA polymerase') and CAC1226 (one of two
annotated sigAs), are only above the expression cutoff in 8
out of 25 timepoints, and these timepoints are not
consecutively expressed. Among the expressed sigma factors,
six, CAP0157, CAP0167, CAC3267, CAC1766, CAC2052, and
CAC0550, are of unknown function, while the remaining
seven expressed sigma factors (σH, σF, σE, σG, σA, σD, and σ54/
rpoN) are of predicted known function. To assess the potential role of the remaining six sigma factors of unknown function, we examined the transcriptional profiles (Figure 6a,b)
and probed the binding motifs in their promoter regions for
predicted Spo0A, σA, σE, and σF/σG binding motifs [37].

Transcriptional analysis of the sigma factors of unknown function

expression [7,48], thus generating increased interest for

sigma factors located on the pSOL1 plasmid as these may play
a role in the regulation of sporulation. Two sigma factors,
CAP0157 and CAP0167, are located on pSOL1 and are annotated as 'special sigma factor (σF/σE/σG family)' and 'specialized sigma factor (σF/σE family)', respectively. It was
predicted that CAP0167 is putatively co-transcribed with
CAP0166 from a promoter of the σF/σG family [37] and it displayed an expression pattern similar to that of spo0A, consistent with the computational prediction of an 0A box [29] and
two reverse 0A boxes in its promoter region (Figure 6a).
CAP0157 was expressed from an unidentified promoter late
in the timecourse (40+ hours) and thus may be involved in
late-stage sporulation, despite its low level of expression at
hour 20 (Figure 6a). CAC3267, putatively the fourth gene in
an operon starting with CAC3270 and ending with CAC3264
[37], was mainly expressed during early exponential growth
(Figure 6a), then decreased, and peaked again around 14
hours, after which expression decreased again. This pattern
of expression suggests that it plays a role in vegetative growth
and possibly early sporulation. CAC0550, putatively transcribed from a σA promoter as a single cistron [37], was
mainly transcribed early with its expression ending after 2024 hours (Figure 6b), suggesting that it is not involved in
sporulation. CAC1766, expressed from an unknown promoter, displayed a unique pattern with a progressive buildup
starting around hours 8-12 and a distinct peak around hour
22 (Figure 6b). CAC2052 is annotated as 'DNA-dependent
RNA polymerase σ-subunit' and was putatively expressed
together with CAC2053, a hypothetical protein, from a σA
and/or a σF/σG promoter [37]. Our data suggest that it is
unlikely to be transcribed from a σF/σG promoter without any
other effectors, as their transcription peaked at hour 16, when
there was very little (if any) σF or σG activity (Figure 6b).

Phylogenetic tree comparison
To help determine a possible function for these sigma factors,
a phylogenetic tree was constructed of σ70 sigma factors from
ten species, including B. subtilis and all sequenced clostridial
species. The resulting tree (Additional data file 6) contains
eleven major branches, and of these, seven can be definitively
classified based on known sigma factors within the branch.
These categories are extracytoplasmic function (ECF), sporulation factors (sigF, sigE, and sigG), sigH, sigA (a basal sigma
factor), sigD (regulates chemotaxis and motility), and sigB (a
general response sigma factor). Two factors, CAC3267 and
CAC1766, fell within ECF branches. CAC3267 fell within an
ECF branch close to the B. subtilis σV, a sigma factor of
unknown function, and σM, a sigma factor essential for
growth and survival in high salt concentrations. CAC1766 fell
within a different ECF branch close to B. subtilis σZ, a sigma
factor of unknown function, and CAC1509, a sigma factor
expressed for less than eight consecutive timepoints. The
remaining four factors fell within clusters with other clostridial sigma factors of unknown function, though several could
have possible ECF function.

Antisense RNA knock-down of four sigma factors: 'fat' clostridial
forms and enhanced glucose metabolism
Of the six expressed sigma factors of unknown function,
CAP0157, CAP0167, CAC2052, and CAC1766 were chosen for
further study because the timing and shape of their expression patterns suggested potential involvement in sporulation
and/or solventogenesis. Since the two processes are coupled,
phenotypic changes in differentiation may affect solvent production, as has been previously observed [4,6,29,33,49].
Antisense RNA (asRNA) knock-down was chosen over knocking out the genes, because knockouts are still extremely
difficult to produce in this and all other clostridia. Indeed, to
date, only a handful of knockouts have been created [29,5053], and these have only been achieved after screening thousands of transformants [51-53]. Recently, a group II intron
system has been developed for clostridia [54], but this system
was not yet available when these experiments were carried
out. In contrast, asRNA is relatively quick, has been shown to
reduce gene expression by up to 90% [33,55,56] and has been
used to knock-down a large number of genes with a high level
of specificity [33,49,55-59]. asRNA constructs (see Additional
data file 7 for specific sequences used) were designed against
CAP0157, CAP0167, CAC2052, and CAC1766 along with
CAC2053 and CAP0166, the first genes in the operons
predicted to contain CAC2052 and CAP0167, respectively
[37]. Cultures of these strains were examined and compared
against the wild type (WT) and plasmid control strain
824(pSOS95del) for cell morphology differences and metabolic changes.
Microscopy results from the asRNA-strain cultures revealed
both novel morphologies and apparently altered differentiation (Figure 6d). Most notable were changes in strains
asCAP0166, asCAP0167 and asCAC1766. Typical WT cultures
display a predominately vegetative, symmetrically dividing
population through 72 hours as evidenced by the thin, rodshaped, phase dark cells (Figure 6d, I). By 72 hours, WT cultures exhibited only a small percentage of swollen, cigarshaped clostridial forms and then a proportional population
of free spores by 96 hours.
pSOS95del cultures exhibited clostridial forms by 48 hours,
suggesting an accelerated differentiation compared to WT, as
has been seen before in our laboratory (Figure 6d, II). Moreover, a greater percentage of clostridial forms and free spores
compared to WT were observed at 72 and 96 hours, respectively. asCAP0166 cultures generated a large percentage of
clostridial forms and endospores/free spores by hours 48 and
72, respectively (Figure 6d, III). This differentiation is accelerated in comparison to pSOS95del. By hour 96, asCAP0166
cultures exhibited predominately vegetative cells apparently
derived from germinated spores (data not shown).
asCAP0167 cultures also exhibited accelerated differentiation
and displayed a novel (to our knowledge) form of cellular
morphology that was most profoundly observable at 72 hours
(Figure 6d, IV). This novel morphology has qualities of an

Genome Biology 2008,

excessively swollen clostridial cigar-form (which makes them
look much shorter than normal clostridial forms), with what
appears to be endospore formation occurring, but without the
associated phase bright characteristics seen in the 72 hour
asCAP0166 cultures. The asCAP0166 culture displayed cells
in this novel morphological state as well, but to a lesser
extent, although it is possible that because of its faster sporulation, such cell forms appeared prior to 72 hours. The
asCAC1766 cultures also exhibited altered differentiation;
most importantly, at 72 hours the majority of the cells exhibited a very swollen clostridial-form morphology similar to
that in the asCAP0167 cultures at 72 hours, but slightly more
elongated (Figure 6d, V).
To further characterize this novel cell form, transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy images of cells were taken for strains asCAP0167 and
asCAC1766. To determine morphological differences
involved in differentiation, the TEM images were compared
against cell images taken from the plasmid control strain
(Figure 7). For both asRNA strains, the very swollen cell
forms observed can be documented as approximately 2.5-4
μm long, and 1.1-1.3 μm in diameter, and should be compared
to control or WT swollen clostridial forms, which are 3.5-6
μm long and 0.8-1 μm in diameter. Forespore and endospore
forms of both asCAP0167 (Figure 7c,d) and asCAC1766
(Figure 7e,f) displayed a pinched end not seen in the plasmid
control (Figure 7b). A slight pinching is seen in the clostridial
forms of the plasmid control strain (Figure 7a), but this is
probably indicative that an asymmetric division is about to
occur. Rather, the pinched ends seen in the antisense strains
occur after asymmetric division and while the spore is developing within the mother cell. These pinched ends are also
noticeable in the scanning electron microscopy images (Figure 8). Though granulose is distinguishable in most of the
TEM images (Figure 7c,d,f), it is not the characteristic electron translucent seen in typical clostridial, forespore, and
endospore forms (Figure 7a,b). These differences were seen
throughout the culture and additional TEM images of both
the plasmid control and the antisense strains are included in
Additional data file 8.
Glucose, acetone, and butanol concentrations from two to
four biological replicates for each strain were averaged
together, and the results are shown in Table 1. We averaged
data from cultures that displayed similar characteristics;
most cultures did so despite the fact that each culture was
inoculated from a different colony for each strain. Acetone
and butanol levels were typical for WT and control cultures,
with the WT producing 90 mM of acetone and 150 mM of
butanol and the plasmid-control strain producing 80 mM of
acetone and 160 mM of butanol [60]. By 192 hours, all strains
had either produced comparable amounts of butanol to the
WT and the plasmid control strain or had somewhat outperformed these two strains. The most significant differences
were that all asRNA strains consumed higher levels of glucose

Volume 9, Issue 7, Article R114

and also had a delayed metabolism in terms of product formation. These metabolic changes, although preliminary, are
consistent with and support the large changes in the kinetics
of sporulation observed by microscopy.

Conclusion

This detailed and previously unrevealed transcriptional roadmap has allowed for the first time a complete investigation of
the genetic events associated with clostridial differentiation.
We were able to link distinct and striking global
transcriptional changes to previously known important morphological and physiological changes. To date, this is the most
complete genetic analysis of the different morphological
forms: vegetative, clostridial, and forespore/endospore.
Importantly, this analysis was performed on a mixed culture,
which may either dilute or produce noise in the data, but
investigation of the clusters identified revealed that these
clusters do capture important known processes. We were also
able to identify a cell population late in the timecourse similar
to vegetative cells. Visually, these late cells looked and acted
like vegetative cells, and transcriptionally, they were also
fairly similar. The major cell motility and chemotaxis genes
were upregulated both early and late in the timecourse
(Figure S2 in Additional data file 3), as were the ribosomal
proteins (Figure S12 in Additional data file 3). Also, the cell
division associated genes rodA, ftsE, and ftsX follow the same
transcriptional pattern of both early and late expression (Figure S11 in Additional data file 3). Although, these cells stain
differently from the early vegetative cells, probably due to
changes in membrane structure in response to the presence of
solvents and do not produce detectable levels of acids or solvents, we believe these cells are germinated cells from spores
produced early in the timecourse. While the triggers for both
sporulation and germination are not known [1], the culture
late in the timecourse is less acidic because of the acid reassimilation, and pH has been shown to be a trigger for sporulation [21].
This study has also allowed the first full comparison to the
widely studied B. subtilis sporulation program. We have confidently identified the temporal orchestration of all known
sporulation-related transcription factors and conclude the
Bacillus model generally holds true with the cascade progressing in the following manner: σH, Spo0A, σF, σE, and σG
(Figure 4f). In addition, we can conclude that the major activating/processing proteins involved in sigma factor activation in B. subtilis play a similar role in C. acetobutylicum,
though additional investigation is needed to clarify their role.
Of significance is the lack of sigK signal. The genes responsible for transcribing sigK in B. subtilis, sigE and spoIIID, were
expressed, but the putative processing enzyme spoIVFB was
not. Two genes under the control of σK in B. subtilis were
expressed, but their expression patterns are not consistent
with each other. Based on the expression pattern of yabG, it

could be controlled by σE, while the late expression of spsF
could be an indication of σK activity.
Finally, in order to determine if one of the annotated sigma
factors of unknown function could be a sigK-like gene, we
first investigated their transcriptional profiles. CAP0157 was
a possible candidate with its upregulation late in the timecourse, as was CAC1766 since its expression was sustained
throughout the stationary phase (Figure 6a,b). Neither of
these genes, nor any of the other sigma factors of unknown
function, clustered close to the known sporulation-related
sigma factors on the phylogenetic tree (Additional data file 6),
but when downregulated using asRNA, both CAC1766 and the
CAP0167 operon (CAP0166 and CAP0167) displayed altered
differentiation (Figures 6d, 7 and 8). Though involved in differentiation, the exact role of these two sigma factors is difficult to assess because of the incomplete silencing of the genes
through asRNA downregulation. Mature free spores and typical endospore forms without a pinched end are still seen
(data not shown), but whether these develop from the novel
cell types or from cells not affected by the antisense cannot be
determined. Interestingly, both CAP0167 and CAC1766 clustered together with other clostridial sigma factors and closer
to ECF sigma factors than to the major sporulation sigma factors sigF, sigE, and sigG (Additional data file 6). In B. subtilis,
ECF sigma factors do not play a role in differentiation [61,62],
though a triple mutant in sigM, sigW, and sigX did display
altered phenotypes [62]. The fact that CAC1766 and CAP0167
appear to affect the developmental process of sporulation
(Figures 7 and 8; Additional data file 8) suggests either that
ECF factors may play a role in sporulation in clostridia or that
a novel category of sigma factors exist in clostridia that play a
role in sporulation.

Materials and methods
Fermentation analysis
Two cultures of C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 were grown in
pH controlled (pH >5) bioreactors (Bioflow II and 110, New
Brunswick Scientific, Edison, NJ, USA) [7]. Cell density, substrate and product concentrations were analyzed as described
[56].

RNA isolation and cDNA labeling
Samples were collected by centrifuging 3-10 ml of culture at
5,000×g for 10 minutes, 4°C and storing the cell pellets at 85°C. Prior to RNA isolation, cells were washed in 1 ml SET
buffer (25% sucrose, 50 mM EDTA [pH 8.0], and 50 mM
Tris-HCl [pH 8.0]) and centrifuged at 5,000×g for 10 minutes, 4°C. Pellets were processed similarly to [7] but with the
noted modifications. Cells were lysed by resuspending in 220
μl SET buffer with 20 mg/ml lysozyme (Sigma, St. Louis, MO,
USA) and 4.55 U/ml proteinase K (Roche, Indianapolis, IN,
USA) and incubated at room temperature for 6 minutes. Following incubation, 40 mg of acid-washed glass beads (≤106
μm; Sigma) were added to the solution, and the mixture was
continuously vortexed for 4 minutes at room temperature.
Immediately afterwards, 1 ml of ice cold TRIzol (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) was added; 500 μl of sample was diluted
with an equal volume of ice cold TRIzol and purified. Following dilution, 200 μl of ice cold chloroform was added to each
sample, mixed vigorously for 15 s, and incubated at room
temperature for 3 minutes. Samples were then centrifuged at
12,000 rpm in a tabletop microcentrifuge for 15 minutes at
4°C. The upper phase was saved and diluted by adding 500 μl
of 70% ethanol. Samples were then applied to the RNeasy
Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), following the manufacturer's instructions. To minimize genomic DNA contamination, samples were incubated with the RW1 buffer at room
temperature for 4 minutes. The method disrupted all cell
types equally, as evidenced by microscopy (data not shown).
cDNA was generated and labeled as described [7]. The refer-

gains of 100% and 10% (Agilent's Feature Extraction software
(v. 9.1)). Normalization and slide averaging was carried out as
described [7,63]. A minimum intensity of 50 intensity units
was used as described [63]. Microarray data have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus database under accession number GSE6094. To gain a qualitative measure of the
abundance of an mRNA transcript, the averaged normalized
log mean intensity values were ranked on a scale of 1 (lowest
intensity value) to 100 (highest intensity value). Genes were
clustered using TIGR's MEV program [64].

For scanning electron microscopy, fixed samples were incubated on poly-L-lysine coated silica wafers for 1 h and then
rinsed three times for 15 minutes in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate
buffer (pH 7.4). The samples were fixed with 1% osmium
tetroxide in buffer for 2 h, washed in buffer and double deionized water, and then dehydrated in ethanol (25, 50, 75, 95,
100, 100%; 15 minutes each). The wafers were critical point
dried in an Autosamdri 815B critical point drier and mounted
onto aluminum stubs with silver paint. The samples were
coated with Au/Pd with a Denton Bench Top Turbo III sputter-coater and viewed with a Hitachi 4700 FESEM at 3.0 kV.

Quantitative RT-PCR
Q-RT-PCR was performed as described [48]. Specific primer
sequences are included in Additional data file 9; CAC3571 was
used as the housekeeping gene.

Microscopy
For light microscopy, samples were stored at -85°C after 15%
glycerol was added to the sampled culture. Samples were then
pelleted, washed twice with 1% w/v NaCl and fixed using 50
μl of 0.05% HCl/0.5% NaCl solution to a final count of 106
cells/μl. Slides were imaged using a Leica widefield
microscope with either phase contrast or Syto-9 and PI dyes
(Invitrogen LIVE/DEAD BacLight Kit) to distinguish cell
morphology.
For electron microscopy, samples were fixed by addition of
16% paraformaldehyde and 8% glutaraldehyde to the culture
medium for a final concentration of 2% paraformaldehyde
and 2% glutaraldehyde. For cultures grown on plates, colonies were scraped from the agar and suspended in 2% paraformaldehyde and 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium
cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4). Cultures were fixed for 1 h at room
temperature, pelleted and resuspended in buffer.
For transmission electron microscopy, bacteria were pelleted,
embedded in 4% agar and cut into 1 mm × 1 mm cubes. The
samples were washed three times for 15 minutes in 0.1 M
sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4), fixed in 1% osmium
tetroxide in buffer for 2 h, and then washed extensively with
buffer and double de-ionized water. Following dehydration in
an ascending series of ethanol (25, 50, 75, 95, 100, 100%; 15
minutes each), the samples were infiltrated with Embed-812
resin in 100% ethanol (1:3, 1:2, 1:1, 2:1, 3:1; 1 h each) and then
several changes in 100% resin. After an overnight infiltration
in 100% resin, the samples were embedded in BEEM capsules
and polymerized at 65°C for 48 h. Blocks were sectioned on a
Reichert-Jung UltracutE ultramicrotome and ultrathin sections were collected onto formvar-carbon coated copper
grids. Sections were stained with methanolic uranyl acetate
and Reynolds' lead citrate [65] and viewed on a Zeiss CEM
902 transmission electron microscope at 80 kV. Images were
recorded with an Olympus Soft Imaging System GmbH Megaview II digital camera. Brightness levels were adjusted in the
images so that the background between images appeared
similar.

Phylogenetic tree generation
Based on the genome annotations available at NCBI, we considered any sigma factor that was annotated as σ70 or unannotated. A second filter was applied by requiring that all the
sequences should contain a Region 2, the most conserved
region of the σ70 protein. All members of this class of sigma
factor contain Region 2, and it was modeled with the HMM
pfam04542. This criterion removed CAC0550, CAC1766 and
CAP0157, but they were added to the list again despite their
lack of a Region 2. The alignment was made using ClustalW
1.83 using the default settings and visualized as a radial tree
as created by Phylodraw v. 0.8 from Pusan National
University.

Generation and characterization of antisense strains
Oligonucleotides were designed to produce asRNA complementary to the upstream 20 bp and first 30-40 bp of the targeted genes' transcripts (Additional data file 7). The
constructs were cloned into pSOS95del under the control of a
thiolase (thl) promoter and confirmed by restriction digest.
Plasmids were then methylated and transformed into C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824, as previously described [33,55,56].
Strains were grown in 10 ml cultures and characterized using
microscopy and HPLC to analyze final product concentrations [56].

The following additional data are available. Additional data
file 1 is a figure comparing the present microarray study to an
earlier microarray study that examined the early sporulation
of C. acetobutylicum followed by a brief discussion. Additional data file 2 contains tables detailing the COG analysis for
each cluster and all the genes placed in each cluster. Additional data file 3 contains figures of the transcriptional profiles, in terms of both intensity and differential expression, of
specific gene clusters with brief discussions following several
figures. Additional data file 4 is a composite figure showing
the individual expression profiles of the genes that were
standardized and averaged and is followed by a brief
discussion on how the genes used to construct the deduced
activity plots were chosen. Additional data file 5 is a figure
showing the differential expression and intensity of all annotated histidine kinases and response regulators. Additional
data file 6 is a figure showing the phylogenetic tree resulting
from the alignment of the σ70-related and unannotated sigma
factors from ten bacterial species. Additional data file 7 is a
table listing the sequences for each asRNA construct. Additional data file 8 contains figures showing additional TEM
