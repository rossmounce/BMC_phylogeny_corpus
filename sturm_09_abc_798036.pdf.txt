Abstract
Background: The large gene superfamily of ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporters encodes
membrane proteins involved in trafficking processes across biological membranes and further
essential cell biological functions. ABC transporters are evolutionary ancient and involved in the
biochemical defence against toxicants. We report here a genome-wide survey of ABC proteins of
Daphnia pulex, providing for the first time information on ABC proteins in crustacea, a primarily
aquatic arthropod subphylum of high ecological and economical importance.
Results: We identified 64 ABC proteins in the Daphnia genome, which possesses members of all
current ABC subfamilies A to H. To unravel phylogenetic relationships, ABC proteins of Daphnia
were compared to those from yeast, worm, fruit fly and human. A high conservation of Daphnia of
ABC transporters was observed for proteins involved in fundamental cellular processes, including
the mitochondrial half transporters of the ABCB subfamily, which function in iron metabolism and
transport of Fe/S protein precursors, and the members of subfamilies ABCD, ABCE and ABCF,
which have roles in very long chain fatty acid transport, initiation of gene transcription and protein
translation, respectively. A number of Daphnia proteins showed one-to-one orthologous
relationships to Drosophila ABC proteins including the sulfonyl urea receptor (SUR), the ecdysone
transporter ET23, and the eye pigment precursor transporter scarlet. As the fruit fly, Daphnia
lacked homologues to the TAP protein, which plays a role in antigene processing, and the cystic
fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which functions as a chloride channel.
Daphnia showed two proteins homologous to MDR (multidrug resistance) P-glycoproteins (ABCB
subfamily) and six proteins homologous to MRPs (multidrug resistance-associated proteins) (ABCC
subfamily). However, lineage specific gene duplications in the ABCB and ABCC subfamilies
complicated the inference of function. A particularly high number of gene duplications were
observed in the ABCG and ABCH subfamilies, which have 23 and 15 members, respectively.
Conclusion: The in silico characterisation of ABC transporters in the Daphnia pulex genome
revealed that the complement of ABC transporters is as complex in crustaceans as that other
metazoans. Not surprisingly, among currently available genomes, Daphnia ABC transporters most
closely resemble those of the fruit fly, another arthropod.

Background
ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins constitute one of the
largest protein superfamilies and are present in all organisms from bacteria to human [1,2]. Prototypical ABC proteins are membrane-bound transporters coupling ATP
hydrolysis to the translocation of substrates across biological membranes [3,4]. In addition to transporters, ABC
proteins also comprise ion channels, regulators of ion
channels, receptors, and proteins with roles in ribosome
assembly and translation. The human genome has 48
genes encoding ABC proteins, of which 17 have been
linked to hereditary diseases, including cystic fibrosis,
adrenoleukodystrophy, Stargardt disease and disorders of
cholesterol metabolism [2,5,6].
ABC proteins share a conserved domain architecture. A
functional transporter requires the cooperation of two
transmembrane domains (TMD) and two cytosolic nucleotide binding domains (NBDs, also called ATP-binding
cassettes). Eukaryotic ABC proteins are either full transporters combining all required domains in one polypeptide (2 TMDs and 2 NBDs), or half-transporters consisting
of 1 TMD and 1 NBD that need to form homo- or heterodimers to constitute a functional pump. According to
their domain architecture and sequence, metazoan ABC
transporters are divided into subfamilies, of which seven
(A to G) exist in human [7]. An eighth subfamily (H) has
been defined following the analysis of the Drosophila melanogaster genome [2]. The H subfamily is missing in mammals, but has one member in zebrafish [8]. The members
of subfamilies E and F are not transporters and differ from
other ABC proteins in that they possess two NBDs but lack
TMDs. ABCE proteins are inhibitors of RNAse L and
involved in the assembly of the preinitiation complex [911], while ABCF proteins have roles in ribosome assembly
and protein translation [12,13].
The first eukaryotic ABC transporter discovered was the
human (h) drug efflux transporter MDR (multidrug resistance) P-glycoprotein (hABCB1/MDR1), the name of
which reflects that its expression in cancers can cause a
decreased cellular drug accumulation (initially referred to
as drug permeability, 'P'), resulting in the resistance of
tumours against chemotherapy [14,15]. Subsequent studies have identified further ABC proteins that are drug
efflux pumps and can cause MDR in cancers, including the
multidrug resistance associated protein (hABCC1/MRP1)
[16] and the breast cancer related protein (hABCG2/
BCRP) [17]. Drug efflux transporters are found in ABC
subfamilies B, C and G [18], and in normal tissues often
show an apical expression in epithelia involved in excretion or forming boundaries of the body, reflecting their
role in the biochemical defence against toxicants [19].
ABC drug efflux transporters have a wide phylogenetic distribution and are found in vertebrates as well as in deuter-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/170

ostome invertebrates (sea squirt Ciona intestinalis [8]; sea
urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus [20]), protostome
invertebrates (nematode Caenorhabditis elegans [21]; fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster [2]), protozoans and yeast
[22,23]. Homologous proteins are also present in plants,
though their roles in multidrug efflux have not been
firmly established [24,25].
The planktic crustacean Daphnia is globally distributed
and has central importance for the ecology of lakes and
ponds. The currently accomplished sequencing of the
Daphnia pulex genome will thus enhance research in disciplines which traditionally have made use of daphnids,
e.g., ecology, physiology, toxicology, population genetics
and behaviour. Moreover, studies with an evolutionary
perspective are further expected to benefit, because Daphnia is not only the first crustacean, but also the first noninsect arthropod to have its genome sequence determined. The aim of this study was to provide a survey of
the ABC transporter gene family of Daphnia pulex. A complete or close to complete list of ABC transporters in Daphnia will facilitate the identification of genes that play a role
during the adaptation of Daphnia to environmental toxicants. Furthermore, ABC genes have been suggested as
biochemical factors contributing to the phenomenon of
resistance against chemotherapeutics in parasites [22,26]
and insects [27,28]. In the aquaculture industry, parasitic
crustaceans constitute a problem of considerable economic importance. The potential development of resistances against therapeutics used to control the crustacean
parasite sea louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) in salmon
farming is currently becoming a concern, and it has
recently been proposed that ABC transporters in the sea
louse could represent potential biochemical resistance
factors to emamectin, a therapeutic used to control sea
louse infestations in salmon [29,30]. At the same time,
the sulfonylurea receptor has been suggested to represent
the target for the chitin synthesis inhibitor diflubezuron
[31], a compound also used to treat sea lice infections.
Thus, ABC transporters might have relevance in crustaceans both as biochemical defence mechanisms against
toxicants, and as targets of toxicity.
From an evolutionary perspective, the wide distribution
of ABC transporters capable of drug efflux transport suggests they are of ancestral origin. However, ABC subfamilies containing drug transporters (B, C, and G) also
comprise proteins with other functions. For instance, the
arguably best known drug efflux pump hABCB1/MDR1
belongs to the B subfamily that also contains mammalian
transporters of bile salts and phospholipids, and yeast
transporters of pheromones. Because of the lack of clear
orthologous relationships between ABC proteins of the
nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans and those of other
genomes, it has been suggested that drug efflux pumps

have evolved independently several times [21]. The annotation of ABC transporters in the Daphnia genome, provided by this work, represents an important resource for
future biochemical, toxicological and physiological studies of ABC drug efflux transporters

analyses on whole length sequences of the whole protein
family. Secondly, while the NBDs of different transporters
show a similar length and organisation, their sequence is
too conserved to provide a meaningful degree of resolution in phylogenetic analysis.

Results and discussion

ABCA
ABCA subfamily proteins are full transporters characterised by distinctive conserved traits, in particular a large
extracellular loop between the first two transmembrane
helices of each TMD, and a family specific motif located
C-terminal of each NBF [33]. Four ABCA subfamily transporters presenting these hallmarks (data not shown) have
been identified in Daphnia (Table 1). An analysis of the
evolutionary relationship of these transporters to human,
worm, and fruit fly ABCA proteins is shown in Fig. 1.
Dappu-(Daphnia pulex)312055 and Dappu-312056 are
neighbouring genes showing a head-to-tail orientation
(Table 1) and display 59% amino acid identity, suggesting
they are the result of a tandem duplication. Dappu312055 and Dappu-312056 group together with
hABCA1/ABC1, hABCA2, hABCA4/ABCR and hABCA7.
Dappu-346971 groups together with the hABCA5 cluster
(hABCA5, 6, 8, 9, and 10). Dappu-347506 groups
together with hABCA3. In mammals, ABCA proteins
adopt critical roles in the control of cellular lipid transport
processes. Loss-of-function scenarios in human monogenetic diseases and mouse knockout models have revealed
roles of hABCA1/ABC1 in HDL biogenesis, of hABCA3 in
lung surfactant production, of hABCA4/ABCR in retinal
integrity and of ABCA12 in keratinisation processes in the
skin [34]. Thus, while ABCA proteins share a functional
relation to lipid trafficking, individual transporters in this
subfamily have adopted highly specialised roles in phospho- and sphingolipid export machineries [34]. In consequence, it is not possible to assign specific putative roles
to the Daphnia ABCA transporters, though it appears likely
that they are involved in lipid trafficking processes.

To identify gene loci encoding ABC transporters, multiple
tblastn searches were performed on the Dappu v1.1 draft
genome sequence assembly (September, 2006) [32] using
NBDs of different Drosophila melanogaster ABC proteins as
queries (one search per subfamily). The most plausible
gene model was selected among machine-generated models available at wFleaBase http://wFleaBase.org and the
JGI genome portal http://www.jgi.doe.gov/Daphnia, and
its NBDs extracted for phylogenetic analysis that further
included NBDs of fruit fly and human ABC transporters.
This resulted in a subfamily-specific clustering of NBDs,
with N- and C-terminal NBDs of full transporters generally allocated to distinct sub-clusters (data not shown).
Based on the clustering of NBDs, Daphnia transporters
were assigned to ABC subfamilies. Gene models were
refined on the basis of sequence homology and EST support, and the subfamily assignment confirmed by protein
BLAST analyses on the National Center for Biotechnology
Information website. Using this strategy, 64 loci of putative Daphnia ABC genes were identified, for 48 of which
evidence of mRNA expression was present in EST databases implemented in the JGI genome portal and wFeaBase (10,392 assembled cDNA on genome scaffolds)
(Table 1). The majority of potential Daphnia ABC genes
lacking EST support (14 of 16) were found in subfamilies
G and H (Table 1), in which a high number of gene duplications was observed (see below for further discussion).
Significant sequence homologies to the query NBDs were
observed at further 15 loci that were excluded from further
analysis [see additional file 1]. Of these loci, four corresponded to obvious pseudogenes, while two most likely
represent bacterial contamination. At the remaining nine
excluded loci, the best obtainable gene models were fragmentary, i.e. showing lack/incompleteness of vital
domains, with many models being affected by sequence
gaps. All excluded loci lacked EST evidence of expression.
To analyse the evolutionary position of the 64 putative
Daphnia ABC transporters identified, phylogenetic analyses compared the complement of ABC proteins in the
Daphnia genome to that in the genomes of yeast (Saccharomyces cervisiae), fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster), worm
(Caenorhabditis elegans) and human (Homo sapiens), using
predicted (Daphnia) or database derived protein
sequences [see additional file 2]. For two reasons, separate
analyses were carried out for each subfamily. Firstly, the
domain architecture of ABC transporters is highly variable
among subfamilies, which complicates bioinformatic

ABCB
The ABCB family can be divided into a group of full transporters (FT) that includes the drug efflux pump hABCB1/
MDR1, and a group of half transporters (HT). Two ABCB
FTs and five ABCB HTs were found in the Daphnia genome
(Table 1). The evolutionary analysis of ABCB FT assigned
the human, worm, and arthropod (combined Drosophila
and Daphnia) transporters into clearly distinguished
clades (Fig. 2), suggesting that this subfamily has diversified through lineage-specific gene duplications. Early
reports have noted the similarity in sequence of three Drosophila ABCB FTs and hABCB1/MDR1, and named these
genes mdr49, mdr50, and mdr65 [35,36]. While no further
information is available on mdr50, the Drosophila gene
most closely related to the two Daphnia ABCB FTs, a
number of studies suggests a role of mdr49 and to a lesser

extent also mdr65 in the biochemical defence against toxicants. The disruption of the mdr49 gene resulted in an
increase in colchicine resistance [35]. A genetic polymorphism related to -amatin resistance in Drosophila was
mapped to the region of the mdr65 gene [37]. Colchicine
exposure and heat shock increases the expression of
mdr49, but not mdr65, in Drosophila larvae, while both
genes were induced in tumours [38]. Mdr49 was further
found to be induced by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and shown to be involved in the transport of these
chemicals [39].
The phylogenetic analysis of ABCB HT revealed comparatively clear orthologue relations (Fig. 3). Human mitochondrial transporters hABCB6, hABCB7, hABCB8/
MABC1 and hABCB10/MABC2 function in iron metabolism and transport of Fe/S protein precursors. The
hABCB6, hABCB7, and hABCB8/MABC1 proteins each
have one orthologue in Daphnia (Dappu-347268, Dappu347270, and Dappu-347266, respectively). The
hABCB10/MABC2 protein has two Daphnia co-orthologues, Dappu-347275 and Dappu-347276, which show
high similarity (83% amino acid identity). The human
transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) is a

heterodimer of two ABCB proteins, hABCB2/TAP1 and
ABCB3/TAP2 [40]. TAP translocates peptides derived
from proteasomal degradation from the cytosol to the
lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, where their loading
onto major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I
molecules occurs [40]. The function of hABCB9/TAPL
(TAP-like) is currently unknown and its subcellular localisation is still under discussion [41]. It has been shown
that TAPL is present in the lysosomal compartment [42],
and it has been recently suggested that it might be
involved in peptide presentation to MHC class II in dendritic cells [41]. As invertebrates lack the mammalian
adaptive immune response, the lack of TAP/TAPL homologues in Daphnia and Drosophila (Fig. 3) is not unexpected. However, the presence of proteins orthologous to
TAP/TAPL in C. elegans (Fig. 3) suggests that these protein
transporters might have further roles unrelated to antigen
presentation.
ABCC
The ABCC subfamily is functionally diverse, comprising
the chloride channel CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane
conductance regulator), the membrane-bound receptors
SURs (sulfonylurea receptors), and broad-specificity

transporters called multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs) that translocate a range of substrates including drugs, endogenous compounds and their glutathione
and glucuronyl conjugates, glutathione, and cyclic nucleotides [43-45]. ABCC subfamily proteins are full-transporters showing two TMDs and two NBDs. Within the
human ABCC family, hABCC8/SUR1, hABCC9/SUR2 and
certain MRPs called 'long' MRPs are unique in that they
possess an additional N-terminal TMD called TMD0

which is lacking in hABCC7/CFTR and the remaining
'short' MRPs [46,47]. Searches of the Daphnia genome
identified seven ABCC transporters (Table 1). The phylogenetic tree of Daphnia, human, worm, and Drosophila
ABCC proteins is characterised by comparatively low support of the more basal nodes, most probably reflecting the
heterogeneity of the ABCC subfamily (Fig 4). Dappu442500 is found in the same, well supported clade as
human and Drosophila SURs, suggesting it is a SUR homo-

logue. Indeed, Dappu-442500 displays a general architecture of SUR and 'long' MRPs, possessing the additional Nterminal TMD0 (Table 1). Moreover, Dappu-442500
shows a significant conservation of two SUR typical N-terminal motifs, the sulphonylurea receptor family signature
(PR01092) and the sulphonylurea receptor type 1 family
signature (PR01093), with predicted amino acid similarities to hABCC8/SUR1 of 73% and 61%, respectively (data
not shown). Together with previous reports of SUR-typical functional traits of the Drosophila protein CG5772
[48,49], the data strongly suggests that Dappu-442500 is
indeed a SUR. Further Daphnia ABCC proteins possessing
an additional N-terminal TMD0 are Dappu-347281 and
Dappu-347323 (Table 1). In our phylogenetic analysis
Dappu-347281 groups together with Drosophila CG6214
(Fig 4), which is a long MRP resembling hABCC1/MRP1

but awaiting in-depth functional characterisation [50,51].
According to the tree obtained in this study, Dappu347323 is a putative orthologue of hABCC10/MRP7 and
Drosophila CG7806 (Fig. 4). hABCC10/MRP7 is capable of
conferring a hABCC1/MRP1-type multidrug resistance
phenotype in cellular models, but its physiological function is at present poorly understood [52]. Functional data
are lacking on CG7806. The remaining Daphnia MRPs,
Dappu-347288, Dappu-347292, Dappu-347295, and
Dappu-347548, show the structural traits of 'short' MRPs
(Table 1). The hABCC4/MRP4 protein groups together
with Dp347288 in a clade of moderately low bootstrap
support (Fig. 4) and is the ABCC transporter showing the
greatest similarity to the Daphnia protein (42% amino
acid identity). Dappu-347292, Dappu-347295, and
Dappu-347548 group together with hABCC5/MRP5 in a

clade of high bootstrap support (Fig. 4). The hABCC4/
MRP4 and hABCC5/MRP5 proteins have been reported to
be able to transport cyclic nucleotides in vitro, but the in
vivo relevance of this observation is controversial and their
physiological roles remain to be unravelled [53]. Dappu347288 groups together in one clade with hABCC4/MRP4
and a cluster of Drosophila ABCC proteins including
CG10505 (Fig. 4). CG10505 is regulated by heavy metals
via the metal-responsive transcription factor 1, and has
been shown to be involved in biochemical detoxification
of zinc and copper [54]. This parallels previous studies
showing that cell lines overexpressing hABCC1/MRP1 are
resistant to arsenite and antimony (reviewed in [47]).
Together these data suggest Daphnia MRPs could represent
potential biochemical factors in the defence against toxicants; however, in the absence of functional data and in

the view of the complex phylogeny of the ABCC subfamily
this remains at present speculative.
ABCD
The ABCD subfamily contains half transporters located to
the peroxisome that are involved in the import of fatty
acids and/or fatty acyl-CoAs into this organelle [55]. The
simultaneous posttranscriptional silencing of three C. elegans ABCD transporters disrupted offspring production in
a previous study, suggesting developmental roles of peroxisomal ABC transporters [56]. Mutations in the
hABCD1/ALDP gene are the principal inherited defect in
adrenoleukodystrophy, a clinically heterogeneous Xlinked recessive disorder characterised by adrenal insufficiency and neuronal demyelination [57]. This study identified three ABCD transporters in the Daphnia genome,

Dappu-347330, Dappu-347326, and Dappu-303977
(Table 1). The phylogenetic analysis revealed that three
clades of ABCDs exist in metazoans, each of which has
one Daphnia member (Fig 5). The high degree of conservation (amino acid identity of Daphnia ABCD proteins to
the closest human homologue between 46% and 55%)
and the clear structure of the phylogenetic tree are consistent with the notion that the function of ABCD proteins in
Daphnia might resemble that in other metazoans.

ABCE and ABCF
The subfamilies ABCE and ABCF are comprised of atypical
ABC proteins that contain a pair of linked nucleotide
binding domains and lack transmembrane domains [58].
The proteins of both subfamilies are highly conserved
across evolutionary diverse taxa, suggesting their role in
fundamental cell biological processes. Most eukaryotes
possess one ABCE protein, and Daphnia conforms to this
rule (Dappu-189585, Table 1). Human ABCE1/RNaseLI

was initially identified as an inhibitor of RNase L [59].
Recent data indicate that human and yeast ABCE proteins
have further a central role in translation initiation [60].
ABCF proteins have roles in ribosome assembly and/or
protein translation [13]. Four ABCF proteins have been
identified in Daphnia (Table 1). The phylogenetic analysis
of ABCE and ABCF proteins was carried out together (Fig.
6). As expected, Dappu-189585 fell into the clade containing other ABCE proteins. ABCF proteins were divided
into four well-supported clades, one of which contained
only yeast proteins, while the remaining three each contained one of the human ABCFs (Fig. 6). Of the Daphnia
ABCF proteins, of which Dappu-347357 and Dappu347363 show 53% amino acid identity and are homologues to hABCF1, while Dappu-304799 and Dappu347354 are homologues to hABCF2 and hABCF3, respectively.
ABCG
As half transporters, ABCG proteins need to form homoor hetero dimers to form a functional pump. In contrast
to other ABC half transporters, ABCG proteins show a
reverse domain architecture, with the TMD being located
C-terminally of the NBD. In human, hABCG1/WHITE1
and hABCG4 are involved in cellular cholesterol efflux to
high density lipoprotein, hABCG5 and hABCG8 mediate
the intestinal and biliary efflux of cholesterol, plant, and

shellfish sterols, while hABCG2/BCRP is a drug efflux
pump [61]. The most intensively studied ABCG protein is
the white protein in Drosophila, which dimerises with
ABCG proteins brown and scarlet to function as a transporter of eye pigment precursors [62]. In yeast and in
plants, certain ABCG subfamily proteins are reverse full
transporters and called PDR (pleiotropic drug resistance)
proteins [63]. Because of their duplicated domain structure (NBD-TM-NBD-TM), yeast PDRs were not included
in the phylogenetic analyses of this study.
The identification of Daphnia ABC transporters revealed
that in this species ABCG proteins form the largest ABC
subfamily (23 members, Table 1). This parallels the situation in Drosophila [2]. The phylogenetic analysis of the
ABCG subfamily revealed that the high number of ABCG
genes in Daphnia and Drosophila is due to extensive lineage
specific gene duplications (Fig. 7). It is know that the
genomes of flies and worms contain a large number of
duplicated genes, with a greater number of tandem or
locally duplicated genes in the C. elegans than the Drosophila genome [64]. A large number of C. elegans annotated genes might be pseudogenes [65,66]. A similar
situation seems to exist in Daphnia, at least with respect to
the ABCG (and ABCH, see next section) family, which
comprises several clusters of putative genes located in
close vicinity displaying high predicted amino acid

sequence similarity (up to 86%), and which further show
a high number of loci lacking EST support (10 of 23 ABCG
proteins Table 1). It seems premature, however, to conclude that the non-expressed putative ABC gene loci
(Table 1) are pseudogenes. For instance, a detailed functional analysis of tandem duplicated ABC genes in the
worm has revealed differential function of the duplicates,
with expression being highly tissue or stage specific [67].
In the phylogenetic analysis of ABCG proteins from the
Daphnia and other genomes, Dappu-347419 and nine further Daphnia proteins forms a clade (Fig 7, top of tree) that
consists of a cluster of eight neighbouring genes on scaffold 7 and two neighbouring genes on scaffold 37 (Table
1). Further down, Dappu-347444 groups together with
Drosophila proteins CG3164 and atet (ABC transporter
expressed in trachea, [68]) as well as hABCG1 and 4.

Dappu-347416 is a homologue of the Drosophila ET23
gene product protein CG3327, an ABCG transporter
believed to regulate intracellular ecdysone concentrations
during development [69]. Phylogenetic analyses grouped
Dappu-258299 together in one clade with hABCG5 and 8,
and two Drosophila proteins of unknown function. Among
the Drosophila eye pigment transporters, the protein brown
(CG17632) does not have a Daphnia orthologue, Dappu347393 is an orthologue of the scarlet protein (CG4314),
while the Drosophila white protein has nine co-orthologues
in Daphnia. Assuming that these proteins might adopt
roles in eye pigment transport in Daphnia appears a reasonable hypothesis. However, it is noteworthy that recent
evidence in Drosophila suggests additional neurobiological functions for the white protein [70,71].

ABCH
The ABCH subfamily is lacking members in mammals
and C. elegans, and has been identified for the first time in
Drosophila [2]. At present, teleost fish are the only vertebrates known to possess ABCH transporters [6,8]. ABCH
proteins are inverse half-transporters showing the same
domain architecture as the members of the ABCG subfamily. The function of ABCH proteins is yet unknown. In
Daphnia, this subfamily is with 15 members the second
largest ABC subfamily (Table 1). The phylogenetic analysis assigned Daphnia and Drosophila proteins in distinct
clades (Fig. 8), suggesting that the diversity of ABCH subfamily in Daphnia has arisen from lineage specific gene
duplications. As observed with the ABCG subfamily, clusters of neighbouring genes displaying high similarity are
found among Daphnia ABCH proteins (Table 1).

Conclusion
The identification and phylogenetical analysis of ABC
transporters in the Daphnia pulex genome, the first available crustacean genome, has revealed interesting traits of
this important group of proteins in Daphnia. The complement of ABC proteins shows parallels between two arthropods Daphnia and Drosophila in that both lack
homologues to the human proteins TAP, protein translocators involved in antigen processing, and CFTR, a chlo-

ride channel regulated by ATP. The high conservation in
Daphnia of ABC proteins involved in fundamental cellular
processes, such as the mitochondrial ABCB half transporters and the members of subfamilies ABCD, ABCE and
ABCF, confirms an earlier study [21] in strongly suggesting an evolutionary ancestral origin of these proteins.
Clear orthologous relationships were observed in further
occasions, providing the basis for a tentative function
assignment to Daphnia homologues of SUR, a membrane
receptor regulating a potassium channel, and to Daphnia
homologues of the Drosophila genes ET23 and scarlet. The
presence of proteins in Daphnia that resemble the ABC
drug efflux transporters hABCB1/MDR1 and hABCC1/
MRP1 is in accordance with the hypothesis that these
Daphnia proteins might adopt roles in the biochemical
defence against toxicants; however, the lack of clear
orthologous relationships makes the inference of function
in these cases uncertain. A high number of duplicated
genes was observed in the ABCG and ABCH subfamilies of
Daphnia. This parallels the situation in Drosophila and
Caenorhabditis, which also show lineage specific duplications, albeit in other subfamilies. More research is needed
to unravel the physiological significance of gene duplications in Daphnia.

Methods
To identify loci of genes encoding ABC transporters,
tblastn searches were performed on v1.1 (September,
2007) of the Daphnia pulex draft genome sequence assembly [32] using the highly conserved NBD [72] of different
Drosophila melanogaster ABC proteins as queries. One
search was carried out per subfamily, each using the
sequence of the NBD (as defined by interpro domain
IPR003439) of a representative Drosophila protein (A:
CG1718; B: CG3879 (mdr49); C: CG9270; D: CG12703; E:
CG5651; F: CG9330; G: white; H: CG9990). If the Drosophila transporter had two NBDs, the N-terminal domain
was used. Hits from individual subfamily specific tblastn
searches (E-value of 10-5) significantly overlapped, with
each search retrieving loci of genes of the query and other
subfamilies. Increasing the E-value to 10-4 increased the
degree of overlap between individual searches, but had no
effect of the total number of loci retrieved, suggesting that
our search strategy gave an exhaustive representation of
those sequences in the current version of the Daphnia
pulex genome that show homology to ABC-transporter
NBD domains. For each locus identified in tblastn
searches, one preliminary gene model representing the
NBD hit with reasonable fidelity was chosen from the
gene models automatically generated by the JGI pipeline.
To assign putative Daphnia ABC genes to ABC subfamilies,
the NBDs of preliminary gene models were extracted
using the ScanProsite facility [73] with predicted protein
sequences and the prosite profile PS50893. NBDs were
then subjected to a phylogenetic analysis together with
those of fruit fly and human ABC transporters, using
neighbour joining and bootstrapping with 5000 replicates
in the program package MEGA4 [74]. NBFs of the fruit fly
and human ABC transporters formed subfamily specific
clusters, with separate groupings for the N- and C-terminal NBFs of full transporters (data not shown). This
allowed unequivocal assignment of Daphnia transporters
to ABC subfamilies. Gene models were then refined on
the basis of homology and EST support. Both the tandem
architecture of ABC transporters of certain subfamilies
and the commonness of tandem gene duplications in
Daphnia made manual adjustments to the gene models
necessary, as machine generated gene models would
sometimes combine exons from distinct genes. The subfamily assignment of Daphnia ABC proteins was confirmed by protein BLAST analyses of the manually
corrected models on the National Center for Biotechnology Information website. Separate phylogenetic analyses
on Daphnia, yeast, worm, fruitfly and human ABC transporters were then carried out per subfamily, using the
same methodology as above [74] on full sequences.
