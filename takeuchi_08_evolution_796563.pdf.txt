Abstract
Background: The evolution of complexity is among the most important questions in biology. The
evolution of complexity is often observed as the increase of genetic information or that of the
organizational complexity of a system. It is well recognized that the formation of biological
organization – be it of molecules or ecosystems – is ultimately instructed by the genetic
information, whereas it is also true that the genetic information is functional only in the context of
the organization. Therefore, to obtain a more complete picture of the evolution of complexity, we
must study the evolution of both information and organization.
Results: Here we investigate the evolution of complexity in a simulated RNA-like replicator
system. The simplicity of the system allows us to explicitly model the genotype-phenotypeinteraction mapping of individual replicators, whereby we avoid preconceiving the functionality of
genotypes (information) or the ecological organization of replicators in the model. In particular, the
model assumes that interactions among replicators – to replicate or to be replicated – depend on
their secondary structures and base-pair matching. The results showed that a population of
replicators, originally consisting of one genotype, evolves to form a complex ecosystem of up to
four species. During this diversification, the species evolve through acquiring unique genotypes with
distinct ecological functionality. The analysis of this diversification reveals that parasitic replicators,
which have been thought to destabilize the replicator's diversity, actually promote the evolution of
diversity through generating a novel "niche" for catalytic replicators. This also makes the current
replicator system extremely stable upon the evolution of parasites. The results also show that the
stability of the system crucially depends on the spatial pattern formation of replicators. Finally, the
evolutionary dynamics is shown to significantly depend on the mutation rate.
Conclusion: The interdependence of information and organization can play an important role for
the evolution of complexity. Namely, the emergent ecosystem supplies a context in which a novel
phenotype gains functionality. Realizing such a phenotype, novel genotypes can evolve, which, in
turn, results in the evolution of more complex ecological organization. Hence, the evolutionary
feedback between information and organization, and thereby the evolution of complexity.

Background
How complexity can increase through evolution has been
one of the most important questions in biology. As is well
recognized, the formation of biological organization – be
it of protein complexes or of ecosystems – is ultimately
instructed according to the genetic information, which is
stored as the patterns of nucleotide sequences in genomes.
Hence, the above question boils down to how genetic
information increases through evolution. This is, however, a one-sided view. The patterns in nucleotide
sequences are biologically functional only in conjunction
with the organization (e.g., consider the function of a regulatory gene). Thus, organization and information are
mutually dependent, and this interdependence is, as this
study will show, a key to understanding the evolution of
biological complexity.
We here investigate the role of this interdependence for
the evolution of complexity in a simulated RNA-like replicator system. The relative simplicity of RNA-like replicators enables us to explicitly model a biologically relevant
genotype-phenotype-interaction mapping of individual
replicators, whereby we avoid preconceiving the ecological functionality of genotypes (information) or the ecological organization of replicators in the model. In more
detail, the genotype-phenotype mapping is modeled by
RNA folding, where the pattern of an RNA sequence (genotype) determines its secondary structure (phenotype)

[1]. The phenotype-interaction mapping is constructed
such that interactions among RNA molecules – either to
replicate or to be replicated – depend on their secondary
structures and base-pair matching among their danglingends. The interactions among replicators then cause a
dynamic feedback on the (spatiotemporal) distribution of
genotypes (see Fig. 1). Thereby, evolution in our model
occurs as a process of pattern formation in the genotype,
the phenotype and the interactions of replicators.
Many theoretical studies have investigated the evolution
of complexity in RNA-like replicator systems (e.g., see
[2,3] for review, and [4] for the experimental background). The customary approach in these studies has
been to assume a network of replicators, where nodes represent replicator species, and edges represent interactions
among them. This approach, however, has limitations, in
that it leaves unexplained how a multitude of species and
their ecological organization emerge from the evolution
of individual replicators. For example, a classical study
suggested the hypercycle [5], a cycle of cooperatively coupled replicators, as a possible solution to the problem of
the error-threshold [6], but it did not demonstrate how
the hypercycle can originate. The study was later extended,
e.g., by introducing random mutation of interaction
strength in various replicator networks [7] or by introducing random growth in replicator networks [8,9]. A new
approach has been taken by several studies [10-12], which

following can be skipped until Discussion: It is interesting to note that while the direction of causal influence is from information to organization, the direction of functional influence is from organization to information.

considered evolutionary processes at the individual replicator level through taking a genotype-phenotype mapping
of interacting replicators into account. However, these
studies still have the same limitations, since their model
assumed a preconceived replicator network (as in the
hypercycle study) and the random allocation of phenotypes to the replicator species – hence, organization and
information were preconceived.
In contrast, our model explicitly takes account of a genotype-phenotype-interaction mapping of individuals without preconceiving the functionality of genotypes or the
ecological organization of a replicator system. Nevertheless, as we will see below, information and organization
arise as the system's emergent properties generated by
evolving individuals. The main focus of this study is to
investigate when and how this happens and, thereby,
obtain general insights about the evolution of biological
complexity. As a conclusion, we will suggest the following
scenario for the evolution of biological complexity: If an
emergent ecological organization is established, it can
supply a context in which a novel phenotype gains functionality. This promotes the evolution of genotypes realizing such a phenotype – the evolution of novel
information. The evolution of such genotypes, in turn,
leads to the evolution of more complex ecological organization. Hence, the evolutionary feedback between information and organization.

Results
Model
Our model is spatially extended, individual based, Monte
Carlo simulation model. It consists of molecules represented by RNA strings of length 50 and their secondary
structure determined through RNA folding (Vienna RNA
package is used [13]). RNA molecules are located on a
two-dimensional square grid of size 512 × 512 with toroidal boundaries, where one square (one spot) holds at
most one molecule. The temporal dynamics of the model
is run by consecutively applying a reaction and a diffusion
step.

In the reaction step, molecules can undergo four types of
chemical reactions: (a) complex formation/dissociation;
(b) replication; and (c) decay, as designated in Eq. (1).

The core part of our model is how to model complex formation and replication reaction, which defines interactions among replicators. Here we employ artificial, yet
biologically relevant rules that can incorporate the complexity of RNA folding genotype-phenotype mapping and
a high degree of freedom into the phenotype-interaction
mapping.
Complex formation happens in our model through binding between the 5'-dangling-end and 3'-dangling-end of
two molecules adjacently located on the grid. Binding
strength is determined by complementary base-pair
matches between the two dangling ends. To be concrete,
the probability of binding k1 is calculated as 1 - eG (that of
unbinding is k2 = 1 - k1), where G (< 0) is the minimal
additive score of complementary base-pair matches in the
alignment of the two dangling ends without gaps. The
score is calculated according to the free energy contributions from base-pairs: a GC contributes to G by -0.15; so
does an AU by -0.1; a GU by -0.05.
Replication reaction can happen in a complex (C) under
a certain condition: the molecule binding with its 5'-dangling-end can replicate the other molecule, if it has a predefined catalytic secondary structure and if the complex is
adjacent to an empty square (the resource). The catalytic
structure was arbitrarily defined as the one having two
hairpin-loops connected by one multi-loop, where the
size of loops is allowed to vary (in Shapiro's notation [14],
it is written as ((((H)S)((H)S)M)S), where H is hairpinloop, and S is stem, and M is multi-loop). An example of
such a structure is depicted in Fig. 1 (the left structure
under "phenotype"). The frequency of random sequences
having such a structure is 4.1%. The replication produces
a new molecule in the empty square. If no mutation happens, this molecule is complementary to the template.
Point mutations are introduced with a probability μ per
base (no other types of mutations are considered). The
probability that replication happens given all the conditions met is set to 1 for simplicity. Finally, all molecules
also decay with the probability 0.03.
The diffusion step is implemented as a type of random
walk: Each molecule can move randomly to one of the
eight adjacent squares if the square is empty.

In summary, molecules diffuse and locally interact. The
interactions happen via complex formation and replication, which depend on the dangling-ends and secondary
structure of molecules (phenotype), which is determined
by their sequence (genotype) (see also Fig. 1). The interac-

tions give a dynamic feedback on the spatiotemporal distribution of genotypes. Thereby, evolution occurs as a
process of pattern formation in the genotype, the phenotype and the interactions of replicators. (See Methods for
more details of the model.)
Simulations are conducted for various mutation rates by
initializing the system with a homogeneous population of
a pre-evolved replicator (the purpose of the pre-evolution
is to simplify the interpretation of the results; see Methods
for details). We then investigate the patterns generated by
evolution in various levels. Firstly, we analyze the patterns
evolved in populations of sequences through constructing
phylogenies. In this we recognize that a population consists of different sequence classes (species) depending on
the mutation rate. We then characterize each sequence
class through analyzing the patterns in its genotypes and
phenotypes. This allows us to infer possible interactions
among the sequence classes. Based on these results, we
next analyze spatiotemporal patterns in the distribution
of replicators, and we reveal complex ecological organization of the replicator system. Finally, we investigate how
evolution generates these patterns over time and how
mutation rate influences the evolution. We also check the
robustness of the results.
Evolved patterns in populations of sequences
At a sufficiently later time step in a simulation (ca.
340000th), a phylogeny was constructed to detect patterns in the population of sequences (see Methods for
details). Surprisingly, the phylogenies reveal that a complex pattern evolves in a population of sequences depending on the mutation rate (μ) as shown in Fig. 2. For a very
high mutation rate (μ = 0.015), the phylogeny displays no
noticeable clade patterns. The population is supported by
various sequences, some of which are found to have the
catalytic structure, while the others do not. The absence of
clade patterns indicate that the population forms one
quasi-species [15]. For a slightly smaller value of μ (=
0.013), however, the phylogeny reveals the existence of
two sequence classes (two quasi-species), which are characterized by their distinct sequence patterns. As μ becomes
even smaller (μ = 0.008, 0.004), the number of sequence
classes increases up to four. In addition, for even smaller
values of μ (< 0.001), the number of evolved sequence
classes fluctuates during the simulation between 2 and 5
(the results for this parameter region will not be further
dealt with in this paper).
Patterns in the genotypes and the phenotypes of sequence
classes
To characterize these sequence classes, their sequence logo
[16] and typical secondary structure are analyzed as
shown in Fig. 3.

Figure 2
Phylogeny for various mutation rates
Phylogeny for various mutation rates. Phylogenies are constructed from 2000
genotypes selected from a simulation for various values of the mutation rate (μ).
They were constructed through maximum likelihood method by using PHYML [43].
Due to great divergence among sequences and the procedure in genotype selection,
the phylogeny depicts only the patterns in the population of sequences, but not necessarily the evolutionary relationship among them (see Methods for details). The
leaves of the phylogenies were colored according to the sequence composition of a
genotype's dangling-end. For catalytic genotypes, the 5'-dangling-end of the catalytic
strand (which is to recognize templates) is chosen. If the dangling-end has more C's,
the color becomes more cyan, whereas, if it contains more A's, then the color
becomes more magenta. For non-catalytic genotypes, the 3'-dangling-end (which is to
be recognized by catalysts) with the most extreme sequence composition among a
pair of complementary sequences is chosen. If the dangling-end has more G's, the
color becomes more red, whereas, if more U's, then more green. In this coloring
scheme, the C-catalyst tends to appear cyan; the A-catalyst, magenta; the G-parasite,
red; the U-parasite, green. However, it should be noted that the red leaves appearing
in the clades of the C-catalyst are not the G-parasite (e.g., see (a)). Instead, these represent the mutants of the C-catalyst that have lost the catalytic structure, and they
are members of the C-catalyst quasi-species (see also "Evolution of the ecological
organization" in main text). This is also the case for the green leaves in the clades of
the A-catalyst. Finally, for more precise color coding, insets indicate the colors as a
function of nucleotide frequencies, where it reads 0.1 on scales (the frequency more
than 0.5 are joined). The left (resp. right) inset is for catalytic (resp. non-catalytic)
genotypes.

For μ = 0.015, there is only one sequence class. Its
sequence and structure have evolved remarkable patterns
optimized for its own replication. But to understand this,
one has to consider the following. To be a self-replicator,
a molecule has to replicate both its exact and complementary copy because replication is complementary (the unit
of replication is a pair of complementary sequences).
Thus, the 5'-dangling-end of the replicase strand (the
strand having the replication activity) must make sufficient base-pair matches both with the 3'-dangling-end of
its complementary copy (template strand) and with that
of its exact copy. The latter is much more difficult because
too many base-pair matches between the dangling-ends in
the same sequence can cause intra-molecular binding (the
dangling-ends disappear by forming stems), which prevents replication.
How did evolution tackle this problem? As shown in Fig.
3(a), the replicator has a long dangling-end in the 5'-end
of the replicase strand and in the 3'-end of the template
strand, and these dangling-ends have an extremely high
frequency of either C's or G's (note that GC-pairs have the
strongest affinity). Moreover, the 3'-dangling-end of the
replicase strand also has many G's, but they are interspersed by U's. These U's prevent base-pair formation
with its own 5'-dangling-end (intra-molecular binding)
by introducing many potential bulges. These bulges are,
however, not destabilizing for complex formation due to
the artificial interaction rules (see Methods). Finally, the
template strand has no 5'-dangling-end, which prevents
the formation of non-functional complexes. In this way,
evolution optimized – partly by playing on the interaction
rules' simplicity – the phenotype of the replicator for selfreplication. For convenience, this sequence class is hereafter called C-catalyst.

Sequence logos and typical secondary structures for each sequence
classes. Genotypes were categorized into sequence classes through the phylogenies
shown in Fig. 2 (see Methods for mode details). Sequence logos were produced by
using WebLogo [45]. The typical secondary structures were produced as follows. For
a set of aligned structures represented by dot-bracket notation, the frequencies of
bound and unbound bases (i.e., '(', ')' and '.') are counted for each structure position.
For each position, if the frequency of '(' or of ')' exceeds 20%, then the corresponding
bracket is drawn; otherwise, '.' is drawn. The color of the brackets represents its frequency: the more frequent, the more red. Physical complexity C [40] was calculated
from the sequence logos (see Discussion for details). For μ = 0.004, CC = 41.3 for the
C-catalyst; CG = 22.5 for the G-parasite; CA = 26.5 for the A-catalyst; CU = 13.0 for the
U-parasite; and C∀ = 13.4 if all sequence classes are grouped together. For μ = 0.008,
CC = 41.5; CG = 19.9; CA = 20.9; and C∀ = 15.7. For μ = 0.013, CC = 37.9; CG = 21.0; and
C∀ = 27.5. For μ = 0.015, CC = 38.2 (CC = C∀ by definition).

The phenotype of the C-catalyst described above is
remarkable, because it is a very intricate matter to realize
it in a viable replicator. As one can see from Fig. 3(a), the
base-pairs forming in the secondary structures are almost
all GC's. But these G's and C's are "hidden" in the
sequence that contains many other G's and C's. This
makes the folding of correct structures difficult, and,
therefore, the replicator must delicately tune up its
sequence. This can be indeed seen from the fact that the
genotypes of the C-catalyst are extremely well conserved
over all sequence positions despite a high mutation rate
(cf. the other sequence classes).
Let us next look at the other sequence classes appearing
for lower μ values. For μ = 0.013, while the C-catalyst also
appears in the system, there is another sequence class as
shown in Fig. 3(b). Interestingly, this class has no catalytic
structure in either strand, but has a long 3'-dangling-end
and no 5'-dangling-end in both strands. These secondary

Biology Direct 2008, 3:11

structures are achieved through the alternative stacking of
three highly conserved sequence regions. The 3'-dangling
end of both strands has a high frequency of G's (especially
the longer ones), and, moreover, the absence of 5'-dangling-ends prevents the formation of non-functional complexes. These patterns clearly indicate that this sequence
class is optimized for being replicated by the C-catalyst
(thus named G-parasite).
For μ = 0.008, yet another sequence class appears as
shown in Fig. 3(c). This sequence class has a structure that
is optimized for replication in a similar manner as in the
C-catalyst. However, while the C-catalyst uses GC-pairs to
form complexes, this sequence class instead uses AU-pairs
(thus named A-catalyst). It is likely that this distinctively
different sequence composition defends the A-catalyst
from the exploitation by the G-parasite (we come back to
this point in the next section). Moreover, the sequence of
the A-catalyst is much more variable than that of the the
C-catalyst, especially at the positions that do not make
base-pairs. This indicates that the A-catalyst has a higher
degree of freedom in its sequence to maintain the phenotype. This is understood because the bases that form pairs
in the secondary structures are mostly G's and C's, while
those that do not form pairs are predominantly A's and
U's. Finally, it is worth realizing that the system evolves
the C-catalyst rather than the A-catalyst for higher mutation rates, even though the A-catalyst has a higher
sequence freedom and, thus, is more robust against mutations. This is an interesting counter example to survival of
the flattest [15,17] (this will be explained in "Effect of the
mutation rate on the evolution").
In addition, note that the sequence pattern of the G-parasite for μ = 0.008 drastically differs from that for μ = 0.013.
These two types of the G-parasite have originated from the
same genotype (the population was initially homogeneous), but followed a different evolutionary path (data not
shown; the G-parasite sequence for μ = 0.013 shown in
Fig. 3 is originally the template strand of the C-catalyst,
while that for μ = 0.008 is originally the catalytic strand of
the C-catalyst). They, however, show effectively the same
parasitic phenotype albeit achieved by different
sequences.
For μ = 0.004, yet another sequence class appears as
shown in Fig. 3(d). This class is similar to the G-parasite,
in that it has long 3'-dangling-ends and no 5'-danglingends. Moreover, it achieves its secondary structure
through the alternative stacking of three sequence regions
as in the G-parasite. But, in contrast to the G-parasite, this
class has accumulated a high frequency of U's in its 5'dangling-ends. This indicates that this class is optimized
for being replicated by the A-catalyst (thus, named U-parasite). Therefore, the U-parasite, while achieving the para-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/11

sitic phenotype in a similar way, has a different "host"
from that of the G-parasite.
In summary, the system has evolved complex patterns of
sequence and structure, from which multiple sequence
classes can be distinguished. Moreover, the observed patterns in the sequence classes clearly indicate catalyst-parasite relationships between them. These relationships
imply the evolution of complex ecological organization,
which will be further studied in the next section.
Ecological organization of the replicator system
We saw that four sequence classes can coexist for μ =
0.004. In particular, the coexistence between the C-catalyst and the A-catalyst is intriguing since their resource is
identical, and, moreover, the sequence patterns they
evolved exclude the possibility of mutualistic coupling
between them such as the hypercycle. How do they coexist?

Fig. 4 shows a snapshot of a simulation, which depicts the
spatial distribution of molecules and its temporal dynamics for μ = 0.004 (see Fig. 2 for the color coding; see also a
movie in Additional file 1). From the snapshot, one can
recognize mutually invading wave patterns, where two
types of waves exist: one which has the C-catalyst in its
front and the G-parasite in its backs (we call it the CGwave); the other which has the A-catalyst in its front and
the U-parasite in its backs (AU-wave). The temporal
dynamics of the waves shows that the front of the CGwave can invade the AU-wave, while the front of the AUwave can invade the back of the CG-wave. Because of this
mutual invasion, both wave types can persist indefinitely,
and thereby the four sequence classes can coexist.
The dynamics of spatial patterns clearly indicate the following ecological relationship between the sequence
classes: The C-catalyst can out-compete the A-catalyst in
the absence of the G-parasite, while the A-catalyst can outcompete the C-catalyst in the presence of the G-parasite.
This relationship can be explained by their sequence patterns. On the one hand, the C-catalyst has a rather high
frequency of U's in the 3'-dangling-end of the catalytic
strand, which makes it possible for the C-catalyst to be
replicated by the A-catalyst. But, the A-catalyst has few G's
in its 3'-dangling-ends. Therefore, the C-catalyst has an
replication advantage over the A-catalyst. On the other
hand, the A-catalyst has a different sequence strategy from
that of the C-catalyst, which enables itself to escape from
the exploitation by the G-parasite. Therefore, if the G-parasite is present, the A-catalyst can invade the C-catalyst.
The U-parasite is not necessary for the coexistence
between the C-, the A-catalyst and the G-parasite, but it
obviously helps the C-catalyst to invade the A-catalyst
(this makes the generated spatial patterns much clearer).

We also examined the importance of spatial pattern formation either by repeating or continuing the simulations
in a well-mixed situation. It turned out that the system
quickly went to extinction in all simulations conducted
(data not shown).
In summary, the results of this section revealed the complex ecological organization of the replicator system, and
how this organization is generated by the interactions
among different sequence classes. Moreover, it was shown
that spatial pattern formation is crucial for the evolution
of the complex organization and even for the viability of
the system.
Evolution of the ecological organization
So far, we have studied the patterns of sequences and the
organization of ecosystems as the outcome of evolution.
Next, we focus on evolution itself and study how these
patterns and organization are generated through the
course of evolution.

A simulation for μ = 0.01 was analyzed in time series (for
μ = 0.01, the system evolves the C- and the A-catalyst, and
the G-parasite). Fig. 5(a) shows the evolution of the Hamming distance between the C-catalyst and the non-catalytic molecules that have a higher affinity to the C-catalyst
than to the A-catalyst. This graph reveals a branching
event happening shortly after the beginning of the simulation. The branch with a smaller Hamming distance represents the mutants of the C-catalyst that have lost the
catalytic structure. Such mutants also appear in the phylogeny shown in Fig. 2 (e.g., the red leaves appearing in
(a)). It must be noted that although some of these mutant
genotypes can still be replicated by the catalytic genotypes, they do not constitute a separate parasitic lineage –
they are members of the C-catalyst's quasi-species. Moreover, they have on average less affinity to the C-catalyst
than the G-parasite as seen from the result presented next.
The branch with a greater Hamming distance turns out to
be the G-parasite as revealed by the sequence analysis. By
following this branch, the affinity (G) between the G-parasite and the C-catalyst was measured in time as shown in
Fig. 5(a). These plots illustrate the evolution of the G-parasite for an improved affinity toward the C-catalyst. These
results show that the origin of the G-parasite was in the Ccatalyst, and after the branching the G-parasite rapidly
diverged from the C-catalyst, evolving its parasitic strategy. Moreover, the results indicate that the G-parasite has
continuity in its lineage. This result supports the notion
that the G-parasite forms a distinct quasi-species from that
of the C-catalyst, which have been indicated by their distinct sequence pattern revealed by the phylogeny. Based
on these results and on the fact that the G-parasite has distinct ecological functionality from that of the C-catalyst as
shown above, we call the G-parasite a different "species"
from the C-catalyst.
We next studied the evolution of the catalysts by measuring the sequence composition of their 5'-dangling-end
(precisely speaking, the frequency of C's minus that of
A's). As shown in Fig. 5(b), the result uncovers another
"speciation" happening in the catalyst population, which
gives rise to the A-catalyst. It is important to note that the
speciation of the A-catalyst is subsequent to the establishment of the G-parasite (see also a movie in Additional file
1).
In relation to the notion of species, we also examined the
effect of recombination on speciation by introducing a
recombination step in the model. The results were qualitatively the same (but see also Authors' response to
Reviewer's report 2).
Let us now consider why the G-parasite and the A-catalyst
evolve. A previous study [18] has shown that in a replicator system with complex formation (as in the current sys-

Dynamics of speciation. (a) Evolutionary dynamics of the G-parasite. The abscissa is time in simulation steps. There are three kinds of ordinate: (1) The ordinate labeled as
distance (black) is the Hamming distance between the C-catalyst and non-catalytic molecules that have a stronger affinity to the C-catalyst than to the A-catalyst (for each of the
chosen non-catalytic genotypes, the catalytic genotype that gives the strongest affinity to it is used to calculate the distance). The affinity is measured in the G score. The distinction between the C- and A-catalyst was done from the sequence composition of their 5-'dangling-end. Gray scale represents the frequency (occurrence) of phenotypes (the
more frequent, the darker). The frequency was averaged over ca. 2000 time steps (100 bins). The plots are based on the top 1000 most abundant phenotypes chosen each from
catalytic and non-catalytic replicators at every 500 time steps (this is also the case in (b); for the definition of phenotypes, see "Construction of phylogenies"). (2) The ordinate
labeled as max(-G) (red) is the average of the theoretical maximal affinity of G-parasites (the sequences in the upper branch of the Hamming distance distribution are the G-parasites). (3) The ordinate labeled as best(-G) (blue) is the average of the maximal affinity G-parasites can gain from the C-catalyst. (b) Evolutionary dynamics of the A-catalyst. The
abscissa is time. The ordinate is the frequency of C's minus that of A's in the 5'-dangling-end of catalytic molecules. Gray scale represents the number of occurrence of phenotypes. The frequency was averaged in the same way as in the Hamming distance in (a).

tem), parasites have a replication advantage over catalysts.
This is because replicating a template costs to a catalyst
some finite amount of time during which the catalyst can
not be replicated, and the parasites, which do not replicate
other molecules, can spend more time as templates than
the catalysts. Thus, the presence of catalysts entails a
"niche" (ecological functionality) for parasites. In the current system, the C-catalyst creates such a niche, and this
enables the evolution of the G-parasite. Moreover, once
the C-catalyst-G-parasite organization is established, it
creates yet another niche, i.e., a niche for a phenotype that
can escape from the G-parasite. Acquiring such a phenotype, the A-catalyst evolves. Finally, the establishment of
such an alternative catalyst, in turn, creates a niche for a
phenotype that can parasitize this alternative catalyst. This
can cause the evolution of the U-parasite, though it does
not happen for μ = 0.01 (this will be explained in the next
section). Finally, under the current artificial interaction
rules, this successive speciation ceases to operate after the
system exploits all nucleotide types.
In summary, the results of this section demonstrated a
chain reaction of niche generation and speciation in an
emergent ecosystem: An emergent ecosystem generates
novel ecological functionality for a certain phenotype;
this promotes the evolution of a novel sequence class
(species) realizing such a phenotype through speciation;
and this, in turn, results in the development of a more
complex ecosystem.

Effect of the mutation rate on the evolution
Let us now consider why the number of species depend on
the mutation rate μ. A previous study [18] has shown that
in a spatial replicator system with complex formation, a
deleterious mutation that destroys both catalytic and template activity of replicators imposes a great disadvantage
to parasitic replicators because of the effective dilution of
the system by inert molecules. In the current model,
increasing the mutation rate (μ) certainly increases the
rate of deleterious mutation. Moreover, as we saw above,
it is not an instantaneous process that the G-parasite gains
its functionality; it is a gradual (albeit rapid) evolutionary
process. This means that the G-parasite suffers the disadvantage of deleterious mutation especially at its early stage
of evolution, in which the G-parasite has not yet evolved
a great advantage over the C-catalyst. Thus, too high values of μ prohibit the evolution of the G-parasite. This prohibition to the early phase of evolution is well illustrated
by the bistability of the G-parasite evolution: we inoculated the G-parasite, which has already evolved in a system with a lower value of μ, to a system with μ of which
value is slightly too high for the G-parasite to evolve, and
observed that the G-parasite can survive (data not shown).

The same explanation can be applied for the mutation rate
dependency of the U-parasite evolution (however, the
bistability was not observed). Moreover, higher mutation
rates prohibit the evolution of the U-parasite also through
increasing the sequence diversity of the A-catalyst, which

Page 8 of 20
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2008, 3:11

makes it difficult to parasitize the A-catalyst (Fig. 3; see
also [7,19]).
Finally, the same line of argument can also explain the
mutation rate dependency of the A-catalyst evolution. As
explained before, the A-catalyst requires the G-parasite for
its survival in competition with the C-catalyst (an exception is observed in the system described in Additional file
2). This explains why the A-catalyst – which is mutationally more robust than the C-catalyst – does not evolve for
the high values of μ for which the G-parasite does not
evolve. Moreover, even if the G-parasite evolves, the A-catalyst does not necessarily evolve (see Fig. 3, μ = 0.013; see
also Fig. 6). This is because greater mutation rates make
the G-parasite not very harmful to the C-catalyst, so that
the A-catalyst cannot out-compete the C-catalyst in the
presence of the G-parasite. But if the mutation rate is sufficiently small, the G-parasite becomes strong enough to
enable the A-catalyst to out-compete the C-catalyst in its
presence. In this case, the A-catalyst can evolve.
In summary, the diversity of the current system depends
on the mutation rate, because greater mutation rates give
a disadvantage to replicators with parasitic strategy. Moreover, the above consideration reveals an evolutionary
safeguard against harmful parasites: If parasites are sufficiently harmful (because mutation rates are small), escape
catalysts evolve exploiting the very harmfulness of the parasite, which stabilizes the system as a whole.

Stability of the system/Recurrence of the results
The current replicator system is extremely persistent: no
single run of simulations showed the extinction of a
whole system for μ > 0.0001 as long as the initial population survives the first few thousand time steps. Moreover,
the ecological organization described above is also stable
during a simulation (simulations were continued typically about 500000 time steps [20]). In one case, which is
a continuation of the simulation for μ = 0.004 described
above, we observed that the G-parasite evolved some
affinity to the A-catalyst, which made the U-parasite go
extinct. However, the G-parasite still had a greater affinity
to the C-catalyst, and thus the three species system persisted.

The simulations were repeated for the other pre-evolved
replicators. The results turned out to be surprisingly recurrent. From all pre-evolved replicators, the C-catalyst, Gparasite, A-catalyst and U-parasite evolved for small mutation rates (their exact genotypes greatly differed). The
mutually invading wave patterns were observed too. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 6, the relationship between the
mutation rate and the presence/absence patterns of the
species was qualitatively the same in all cases except for
one (see Additional file 2 for this case). Finally, we also
examined the effect of spatially heterogeneous decay rates
on the evolutionary dynamics and on the formation of
spatial pattern by following a previous study [21]. The
results were qualitatively the same as presented above (see
also Authors' response to Reviewer's report 2).

Figure 6

The number of evolved sequence classes (species) as a function of the mutation rate for five simulation series. For each series, simulations were initialized with a
homogeneous population of different pre-evolved replicators. At some high mutation rate, the number of species drops to zero. This indicates that the system collapses because
the mutation rate is above the error-threshold. Plots are not drawn for low mutation rates, because the number of species and their sequence patterns fluctuate in this region of
the mutation rate. The red-colored plot is for the simulation series that are described in main text. For μ = 0.004, the system eventually evolved to the three species system (the
C- and the A-catalyst, and the G-parasite) as explained in main text. The star depicted at μ = 0.004 designates the number of species at the metastable state (note that the phylogeny for μ = 0.004 in Fig. 2 is generated in this metastable state). The plot designated by (e) is for the simulation series that exhibited functional polymorphism without speciation
(the details are explained in Additional file 2). In this plot, the dotted line denotes that the number of species can fluctuate between 2 and 3 (see also Additional file 2).

Discussion
From a prebiotic evolution point of view, the novelty of
the current study is that it demonstrated the evolution of
emergent ecological organization in an RNA-like replicator system through the evolution of individual replicators.
This contrasts with previous studies [5,7,10,12,21-24],
which investigated the maintenance of predefined ecological organization
Moreover, this study sheds new light on the relationship
between parasites and the complexity of replicator systems. It has long been thought that the parasites destabilize replicator systems; accordingly, many studies
investigated how catalysts can resist or coexist with parasites ([11,18,25,26]; also the references cited in the previous paragraph). Our results, however, showed that
parasites can, not only coexist with catalysts, but can actually cause the evolution of further complexity. In fact,
Hanczyc and Dorit [27] also observed from their in vitro
evolution of ribozymes that the system increased its complexity through the evolution of parasites (or partner molecules as they called it), and they suggested that parasites
(1) set the stage for the generation of further complexity
and (2) be the raw material for the evolution of novel
functions. Our results demonstrated the first suggestion,
but only partly the second one. The extension of our
model to include more kinds of catalytic activities, such as
ligase and nuclease, may elucidate this point further (see
Ref. [7,28] for evolutionary significance of ligase). In particular, it is of interest whether (or how far) spatial pattern
formation alone can support the further increase of functional complexity in the replicator system. It is also of special interest what extra effect – be it positive or negative –
can be brought about by the compartmentalization of
replicators by membranes [7,22,29,30] or by inorganic
materials [31].
Our study also illustrated an interesting relationship
between the problem of parasites and that of the errorthreshold. For mutation rates close to the error-threshold,
the catalysts were free from the evolution of parasitic species, but greater diversity did not evolve either [18]. Lowering the mutation rate caused the evolution of parasites,
which, however, enabled the evolution of even greater
diversity. Hence, in the current system, greater mutation
rates cause smaller replicator diversity, while smaller
mutation rates cause greater replicator diversity. Therefore, while it is well known that greater mutation rates
limit the accumulation of information due to the errorthreshold [6], greater mutation rates can also limit the
evolution of complexity by inhibiting the evolution of
complex ecological organization.
Finally, we emphasize that extreme persistence was seen
in the current spatial replicator system where the evolu-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/11

tion at the individual level determines the system's ecological organization, and vice versa. This is because upon
the exploitation by harmful parasites, the system can
evolve more complex ecological organization by exploiting the very harmfulness of the parasite, which then stabilizes the system as a whole.
From an evolutionary biology point of view, the distinct
feature of the current model is that the evolution is modeled as a process of pattern formation in the genotype, the
phenotype and the interactions of replicators, where a
genotype determines a phenotype; a phenotype determines interactions; and the interactions give a dynamic
feedback on the spatiotemporal distribution of genotypes
(Fig. 1; a similar view has been taken previously [32]). In
the following, we discuss this point through comparison
with other models.
Firstly, the current model contrasts with those evolution
models where species and their ecological organization
are preconceived properties of the system (see also Background). In our model, a species was instead an a posteriori
recognized entity, representing a multitude of genealogically related individuals (i.e., quasi-species [15]) sharing a
distinct functionality in the ecosystem where they lived.
Ecological organization was recognized in parallel with
that of species through the analysis of the phenotypes and
spatial distributions of the species. In other words, species
and ecological organization were the system's emergent
properties, which evolved as patterns in the genotypes,
phenotypes, interactions and spatial distributions of individuals.
Secondly, the current model also contrasts with those
models that preconceive the possible ecological functionality that can be achieved by different genotypes (see also
Background). For instance, the adaptive dynamics model
of [33] predefines a spectrum of resources an organism
can consume, and it studies whether/how a population
radiates in this space of preconceived ecological functionality (the situation is similar in [34]). In contrast, the ecological functionality of the evolved genotypes in our
model is not predefined, but is generated by the ecological
organization. Moreover, the ecological organization itself
is generated by evolution through a chain reaction of
niche generation and speciation. Hence, evolution generates information from within the system.
Finally, the above two points are linked with one another.
Emergent organization supplies a context in which novel
information can evolve, and the evolution of novel information in turn generates more complex organization.
Hence, the positive feedback between the evolution
organization and that of information, and thereby the
evolution of complexity.

To our knowledge, the only model that has also showed
such an auto-catalytic increase in the complexity of an
evolving system is Ray's Tierra [35], which studied the
evolution of self-copying computer programs. Although it
was later reported that the ecological organization in
Tierra tended to disappear in the course of evolutionary
optimization for self-replication [20], the general insight
obtained from Tierra is very similar to that presented
above.

Conclusion

Biological complexity has been studied by many authors
from various aspects ([36-39] to name a few). Among others, Adami et al. [40] suggested to quantify the complexity
by the amount of information in sequences (genomes).
The information was measured by the degree of conservation in sequences, which is based on the idea that the test
for information is how successful sequences are in the
environment where they live. Let us consider this in our
model. If the complexity (denoted by C) is calculated simply from all sequences in the system, it will be lower for
the system with more species, contradicting one's intuition. Instead, it seems more natural to calculate C for each
species separately (as is done in Fig. 3) and then to add
them up to the total information in the system. This idea,
in fact, shows a view that the functional diversity contributes to the amount of information in a whole system [5].
However, since the functional diversity most likely
accompanies sequence diversity, the quantification of
information in sequences encounters the dichotomy of
conservation and diversity. The question is, how to classify sequences in "right" groups, which depends on how
to define what the right groups are. Phylogeny is one of
the best tools for this (as demonstrated here), but it is not
guaranteed that phylogenetic classes coincide with functional classes (see Additional file 2). This dichotomy may
be averted, in principle, by an exhaustive search of all possible sequences for those performing a priori specified
functions [41]. But there are other problems: First of all,
the biological functions of sequences must be discovered
with respect to the organization in which they live. Moreover, to sum up the complexity of multiple species (or
functions), it may be natural to factor in the functional
(dis)similarity between species; however, how to do this
quantitatively is an open question.

• Extreme persistence is observed in the replicator system
where the evolution at the individual level determines the
system's ecological organization, and vice versa.

In closing, the authors note that the general concepts discussed above, such as the evolutionary feedback between
information and organization, are not entirely new in the
field of evolutionary biology. The point of this study is
that our model – where evolution was viewed as a process
of multi-level pattern formation – exhibited a prototypical
instantiation of those general concepts.

• Complex ecological organization can evolve in a simple
RNA-like replicator system, where parasitic replicators
actually promote the evolution of diversity, rather than
inhibit it.
• Smaller mutation rates allow the evolution of complex
ecological organization, while greater mutation rates
inhibit it.

• This study demonstrates an evolutionary feedback
between information and organization and, therewith,
suggests a potential scenario for the evolution of biological complexity.

Methods
Details of the model
As explained before, our model is spatially extended, individual based, Monte Carlo simulation model. One time
step of the model consists of a reaction and diffusion step,
of which details are described below.

The reaction step was further divided into the production
and the decay step. The algorithm of the production step
runs as follows. Choose every square of the grid once in a
random order. For each chosen square,
(1) if the square contains a free molecule (i.e., a molecule
not making a complex; let us denote this by X), then randomly choose another square from the eight squares adjacent to the first square (i.e., Moore neighbors). If the
second square also contains a free molecule (denoted by
Y), complex formation can happen either between X's 5'end
and
Y's
3'-end
with
a
probability
k1 = 1 − exp(G X 5′ ~ 3′ Y ) or between Y's 5'-end and X's 3'-

′
end with a probability k1 = 1 − exp(G Y 5′ ~ 3′ X ) (G is the
binding energy between the two dangling-ends as
explained in main text). These two possibilities are exclu′
sive. If k1 + k1 > 1, then each probability is normalized by

′
dividing with k1 + k1 . If a complex is formed, the two molecules are marked as composing a complex molecule. One
complex molecule is represented by two molecules occupying two contiguous squares.
(2) If the square contains a molecule making a complex,
then complex dissociation can happen with a probability
k2 = exp(G), where G is calculated from the two dangling
ends forming a bond.

(3) If the square is empty, then chose another square randomly from the Moore neighbors of the first square. If the
second square contains a molecule making a complex,
then replication can happen with a probability κ = 1.
In the decay step, every molecule is removed with a probability d = 0.03. If a chosen molecule is forming a complex, then it is removed, but the molecule with which it
forms a complex is not removed.
In the diffusion step, every square is chosen once in a random order. For each chosen square, if it contains a molecule, then choose another square from its Moore
neighbors. If the second square is empty, the molecule in
the first square is moved into the second square with a
probability p, where p = 1 for a free molecule; and p = 0.9
for a molecule making a complex (this is to take into
account an increased volume of complex). For the diffusion of a complex, the other molecule of the complex that
is not in the first square is moved into the first square so
that two molecules are always adjacent to each other, and
a complex is not chosen twice in one diffusion step.
The model was programed based on CASH library [42].
The source code is available upon request.
Pre-evolution (preparation for simulations)
From randomly generated RNA sequences, those that can
replicate itself were chosen. Homogeneous populations of
these replicators were used to initialize a series of simulations. The mutation rate μ was initially set to 0.001 or
0.005, but gradually increased to the maximal limit for
the survival (i.e., the error-threshold), which was about
0.015. At the end of each simulation, the most abundant
genotype was chosen as a pre-evolved replicator. In this
way, five different pre-evolved replicators were obtained
(see Additional file 3 for the obtained sequences). Then, a
homogeneous population of a pre-evolved replicator was
used to initialize next simulations, of which results are
reported in the paper.

The preparatory evolution was conducted because randomly generated RNA replicators were not able to tolerate
high mutation rates used for the main results. Moreover,
the fact that each simulation is initialized by a single genotype makes it easier to study the evolutionary dynamics.
Therefore, the above preparations enable us to focus on
essential results that support our main messages.
Construction of phylogenies
To construct a phylogeny, two thousand genotypes were
selected from the system as follows. At a sufficiently later
simulation step (ca. 340000-th steps), the 1000 most
abundant phenotypes were chosen each from catalytic
and non-catalytic replicators, where a phenotype was

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/11

defined by the secondary structure in Shapiro's notation
[14] and by the sequence of both dangling-ends. For each
of those 2000 phenotypes, the genotype with the largest
population was chosen to be the representative. Here, one
genotype consists of a pair of complementary sequences
(for this is the unit of replication); thus, we obtain 2000
pairs of complementary sequences. Complementary
sequences must not co-occur in the same phylogeny, so
that one has to choose one strand from each pair. This is
identical to labeling each strand either as plus or minus
(note that this labeling has nothing to do with the functionality of sequences). This labeling was conducted
through simulated annealing method that minimizes the
Hamming distance among the sequences with the same
label. From the so selected 2000 sequences, a phylogeny
was constructed by using PHYML [43] with option 0 i 1 0
HKY e e 4 e BIONJ y y. The root of a phylogeny was chosen
so as to make the phylogeny more clearly visible. The
alignment of sequences was unnecessary because only
point mutations were allowed to occur during a simulation. Finally, note that the above simulated annealing
method may not necessarily reconstruct the evolutionarily true plus/minus classification if sequence divergence is
too large; therefore, the phylogenies constructed here
should be considered as a tool to detect the structures in a
population of sequences. The validity of this method was
checked by a more direct method, in which molecules
were labeled either as plus or minus at the beginning of a
simulation, and the labels were complementarily copied
when replication happens. Phylogenies constructed with
this method also detected the same sequence classes
reported in this study.
Construction of sequence logos and typical secondary
structures
From the phylogenies shown in Fig. 2, clades representing
each sequence class were selected with the aid of TreeDyn
[44]. Since each leaf of a phylogeny is a genotype that represents one phenotype, one has to compile, for each
selected clade, an ensemble of genotypes in which the
population size distribution of genotypes is taken into
consideration. From such an ensemble of genotypes,
sequence logos were produced by using WebLogo [45],
and typical secondary structures were produced in the
method described in the caption of Fig. 3.

or less) general scenario for the evolution of biological

complexity. The importance of the problem indisputable.
The model is limited in scope because it assumes rather
chemically unrealistic requirements for replication and,
perhaps, even more importantly, requires "pre-evolution", i.e., the origin of replication, the absolute crucial
step in the origin of life, is not addressed. This being said,
the results are pretty amazing in that so much complexity
and diversity is shown to emerge from very simple rules of
replication, interaction, mutation, and decay. It also
seems important and intuitively reassuring that compartmentalization emerges as a strict condition of complexification, i.e., the population dies out in a homogeneous
medium, just as expected from a biological standpoint.
Perhaps, the most striking result is the evolution of parasites and the enhancement of complexification in the
presence of parasites. Again, is very biologically plausible,
and it is amazing that the effect is seen with such a simple
model. With all the limitations of artificial modeling
approaches, I think this study tells us something valuable
about the earliest stages of life's evolution. I suspect that
the model can be readily generalized, i.e., the specific
parameters of interaction adopted in this study are not
crucial.
Authors' response
We completely agree with the reviewer that the current
model does not address the origin of replicators, which is a
very important question in RNA world hypothesis.

The assumptions made for replication and interactions in
our model are indeed chemically unrealistic: First of all,
merely having a particular secondary structure does not, in
reality, result in the replicase activity. Moreover, base-pair
matching between dangling-ends is not the way real RNAlike replicators would interact (for more technical points,
please see also our response to Dr. Szathmáry's comments).
Thus we agree that the assumed RNA molecules are "toy".
However, the current model is, to the authors' knowledge,
the first of the kind that explicitly takes account of a biologically relevant genotype-phenotype-interaction mapping of
replicators. To achieve this goal, we chose to implement very
simple interaction rules.
We also think it is important that some kind of spatial isolation is necessary for the maintenance and origin of complexity in replicator systems. In particular, this study dealt
with the effect of spatial self-organization, which dynamically segregates different species of replicators, without
explicit compartmentalization by lipid or inorganic boundaries.
As the reviewer pointed out, an important point of this
study is that parasites can actually facilitate the evolution of
complexity. It would be very interesting to investigate

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/11

whether one can extend this idea to other contexts, e.g., to
the role of viruses in the evolution of proto-cellular systems.
Reviewer's report 2
Eörs Szathmáry, Collegium Budapest (nominated by Anthony
M Poole, Stockholm University).

This is an interesting paper that is likely to be cited a lot,
and it is likely to trigger similar investigations in the
future. I like that the authors stress that information and
organization together make complexity, and that the
emergent ecosystem creates functionality. I could not
agree more.
Whether the details of the concrete model tell us much,
beyond its didactic/pioneering value, is another matter.
Much depends, for example, on the assumption that during complex formation binding through dangling ends is
predefined – we know that this is NOT how, for example,
the templates are recognized by the Qβ (protein!) replicase (since we do not have a replicase ribozyme we have
to look at what we have). Very different results may be
seen if a certain secondary/tertiary structure were the target to be recognized by the replicase, but the present modelling techniques are not sufficient, so we have to accept
the 'toy' approach of the authors.
Authors' response
We recognize that the interaction rules employed in the current model are simplistic. Thus, we must interpret the
model and its results with a great care. For this sake, let us
speculate what would be similar or different if a model
assumes more realistic interaction rules, e.g., by using cofolding of RNA molecules.

Firstly, interactions between RNA molecules would still
involve base-pair matching as a primary process as in the
current rules. However, which parts of two sequences make
base-pairs will be determined through complex interactions
between the two sequences. This is in contrast to the current
rules, where each sequence independently determines
which parts can interact with the others (dangling-ends).
Secondly, it still seems reasonable – though possible to conceive otherwise (which is an interesting question in its own
sake) – to assume that a replicator has two separate motifs
either to recognize or to be recognized by other molecules. If
this were the case, then it would still hold that it is more difficult for a catalyst to be recognized by its exact copy than
for parasites to be recognized by catalysts because of the
problem of intra-molecular recognition in catalysts.
Finally, with respect to the evolutionary dynamics, the problem of intra-molecular recognition and the fact that complex formation gives an advantage to parasites – merely to

Page 13 of 20
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2008, 3:11

stop replicating the other molecules gives replication advantage [18] – can still facilitate the evolution of a parasite
and, thereby, that of an escaping catalyst (and so on?).
However, such strategies, if they evolve, would be achieved
in different, more complex manners than in the current
model. Furthermore, more complex ways of interactions
might perhaps allow more possible combinations of catalysts
and parasites for evolution.
When talking about complexity, the assumptions of no
recombination and of fixed length are presumably rather
strong, and one would like to see them reduced in the
future. The occupation of sequence/function spaces could
be very different as a result of complexification relying not
only in point mutations but also on insertions, deletions
and recombination (see another remark at the end of
these comments).
Authors' response
The assumption of fixed sequence length artificially limits
the accumulation of information within one quasi-species.
We assumed this for simplicity because we wanted to focus
on the increase of information via the evolution of diversity.
Relaxing this assumption opens up a possibility of complex
interplay between these two ways of information accumulation. It is certainly possible that evolutionary dynamics
would significantly differ in such a case, and it is indeed
interesting future research. (With regard to recombination,
please see also our reply to the reviewer's other comment.)

The emerging set of different strategies in relation to the
mutation rate is fascinating. When reading main text I
thought that the order in which these creatures appear is
largely explained by the binding energy, but then in Additional file 2 saw that in the "internally polymorphic"
group at high mutation rates the A-catalyst prevailed – so
I at the moment do not understand the order clearly. Actually, this functionally polymorphic case is highly interesting, and I suspect that its deeper understanding could
result in that of the whole model. Couldn't it be the case
that here we are, in contrast to the cases in main text, dealing with 'survival of the flattest' at high mutation rates?
Authors' response
Yes, it is probably the case that because of its "flatness", the
A-catalyst of this simulation series wins for greater mutation rates. But why this particular line of replicators develops functional polymorphism without speciation is still not
clear to us. While the genotypic diversity of a quasi-species
can be explained by its flatness, this functional polymorphism without speciation may be attributed to the topology
– rather than the mere flatness – of the local region of the
genotype-phenotype mapping in which this line of replicators resides. To facilitate future investigation, we now list

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/11

the genotype used to initialize this simulation series (and
also the other four genotypes) in Additional file 3.
In the sequentially diverging cases the mutual invasions,
and their spatial correlates, are interesting. Yet I am
slightly worried about the robustness of these patterns.
Based on our re-analysis of Dr. Hogeweg's hypercycle-celullar automaton model, I know that surprisingly little disturbance can collapse mesoscopic patterns. So, what
about disturbance of the pattern by a patchy environment,
assuming variation in, say, the desorption rate of molecules from the surface across the cells? Actually, in this
case I am only slightly worried, but still would feel better
if reassured.
Authors' response
This comment led us to examine the effect of spatial heterogeneity in decay rates in the current model. But before
describing the results, let us comment on our previous studies of the hypercycle. In our earlier study [24], we reported
that the hypercycle does not self-organize into spiral-waves
if the molecular species in the hypercycle differ too much in
their parameters – stated differently, the heterogeneity in
individuals disturbs the formation of the spiral-wave patterns. This point was extended in our later study [7], which
simulated the hypercycle with mutating parameters and
showed that the hypercycle is evolutionarily unstable. This
study also examined other types of replicator organization
than the hypercycle and showed that some of those systems,
in particular the ligation system, are stable against parasites
despite the continuous mutation of parameters. This difference in the stability is attributed to the difference in the spatial pattern generated by the replicator organization. The
spiral wave of the hypercycle is so regularly structured that
it is sensitive to the disturbance due to the individual heterogeneity (and to the disturbance due to the spatial heterogeneity as the reviewer pointed out). In contrast, the wave
patterns observed in the other replicator organization are
more irregular (erratic), and this irregularity probably gives
robustness against individual heterogeneity.

In the current model, the mutually invading wave pattern
is generated by the replicator organization that has arisen
through evolution. This means that the pattern has to be
robust against individual heterogeneity (otherwise, it would
not evolve). Also notable is that the mutually invading wave
pattern is erratic and irregular too. Furthermore, this
robustness against individual heterogeneity can also bring
about the robustness against spatial heterogeneity. To
examine this, we studied the case of spatially heterogeneous
decay rates in the current model. Following the work
referred to by the reviewer [21], we randomly placed 100
blocks of size 26 × 26 with d = 0.0093 (d denotes the decay
rate) in the grid with d = 0.03719. In this way, the decay
rate is, on average, the same as the one originally used (d

= 0.03); moreover, the situation closely matches the case
reported in Ref. [21] (the same portion of space that has the
lower decay rate; the same ratio between the two decay
rates). The results of simulations turned out to be qualitatively the same as those presented in this paper.
I find the terms "species" and "speciation" highly problematic for this model, since there is no recombination.
This is not Physica D or E, so I really would recommend
dropping this misleading terminology – the term
'sequence classes', used by the authors themselves, is more
precise (even if less attractive). Nevertheless, even in the
presence of recombination we may find similar diversifying selection on the population, leading to proper speciation, but we cannot know. By the way, the described
processes and even some of the plots are similar to what
one sees in the field of adaptive dynamics, which also
prompts me to point out that the authors are presenting a
nice case of frequency-dependent selection. This connection may be spelled out.
Authors' response
Let us first explain why we used the term "species" in this
paper. In the current model, a sequence class has an independent line of descent from the other sequence classes after
the branching event. Secondly, the sequence classes have
distinct ecological functionality. To emphasize these two
points, we came to refer to the sequence classes as species.

Upon the reviewer's comment, we also examined the effect
of recombination. Recombination was implemented in the
model by introducing a recombination step, in which every
molecule that does not form a complex has the probability
(0.01) that it recombines with another non-complex molecule randomly chosen from its Moore neighborhood (the
exact algorithm is identical to the other second order reactions). It is assumed that recombination maintains the
length of sequences, and it happens independently of the
homology between sequences. Simulations were run for the
small mutation rates for which four species evolve (ca.
0.004) for the 5 simulation series. In such a set up, recombination was measured to occur on average 0.23 times per
individual per average life time of replicators. This is comparable to the probability of mutation per replication, which
is 0.18 when μ = 0.004. The results showed that speciation
still happened despite recombination. In some cases, the
four species evolved as we observed in the case without
recombination. But there were also differences: (1) It took
more time steps for speciation to occur. (2) The sequence of
the G-parasite was often more similar to that of the C-catalyst than in the case without recombination. This can be
explained by selection to reduce recombination load. (3)
The U-parasite often did not evolve. This is probably
because the recombination effectively increases the rate of
deleterious mutation.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/11

In relation to the adaptive dynamics, the current model has
an important difference, and we now explain this in Discussion section (please see also our reply to Dr. Adami's
comments).
Finally, we note that our examination of recombination is
far from a complete investigation, and a more through
analysis would be worth while.
Some other remarks: "authors note that the general concepts discussed above, such as the evolutionary feedback
between information and organization, are not entirely
new in the field of evolutionary biology." – could we have
some citations?
Authors' response
We do not know a literature stating exactly the same concept. But the most closely related literature we know is Ref.
[35], and we now cite this in Discussion.

"Spatially extended RNA-like replicator systems can be
extremely stable against parasitic replicators, because the
system can evolve complex ecological organization that
stabilizes itself against strong parasites." What is a 'strong
parasite'? Anyway, I think that this conclusion is hardly
new.
Authors' response
We realized that the sentence – which originally appeared
in the second (currently the third) item of Conclusions –
can convey an unintended message. We modified the text.

"The preparatory evolution was conducted because randomly generated RNA replicators were not able tolerate
high mutation rates used for main results" – I think this is
a missed opportunity, and it is linked to the idea of starting with smaller molecules and a richer set of component
processes (see above).
Authors' response
This is an interesting point as we have already written in
this reply. The preparatory evolution was an artificial procedure, in that it merely made use of evolutionary optimization to obtain replicators that can tolerate higher
mutation rates. As a future extension of the current model,
one can start with shorter RNAs – so that mutation rate per
genome is small – and include the possibility of the evolution of longer sequences by allowing more complex chemical/mutational processes.
Reviewer's report 3
Chris Adami and Bjorn Østman, Keck Graduate Institute.

In this paper the authors study the evolution of RNA-like
replicators in a computational system. They observe adap-

(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2008, 3:11

tive radiation and the evolution of co-existence of up to
four ecotypes depending on the mutation rate. They conclude that the evolution of complexity in this system relies
on an interplay between information acquisition and
organization.
This is an interesting study in which ecological complexity
is seen to emerge in the absence of a predetermined set of
species. Instead, the ecological interactions emerge simply
as adaptations to the computational chemistry implemented in the system. The authors suggest that the evolution of parasites (as observed in this study when the
mutation rate is low) may also have aided the evolution
of complexity in an RNA world, rather than destabilize it.
We have several general remarks and numerous minor
points. We hope that the authors can address those in general and in detail, so that our final review will sound much
more positive than what we have to say in the following.
Generally speaking, the paper is poorly structured. Results
are presented without an apparent ark that orders the
observations in support of a testable hypothesis. Several
times the reader is promised a result elsewhere in the
paper, which then is either not forthcoming or buried. The
prose in this paper is very uneven, and drifts from passable via opaque to completely informal comments. This is
not the style of a professional research paper. Also, the
level of English language proficiency is below an acceptable level, and has to be raised significantly, along with an
improvement in orthography.
Authors' response
We improved the text according to the detailed list of linguistic issues painstakingly compiled by the reviewer (the
list is not included here), for which we thank the reviewer.
With respect to the structure of the paper, we have largely
kept the original, because after scrutinizing the text we still
think that the original structure best conveys our intended
message. We added a paragraph to explain the structure in
the presentation of our results (please see the end of Model
section).

Besides the structural problems of this paper, there are
also numerous scientific issues we have to raise. First and
foremost among them is the discussion of adaptive radiation. It is beyond doubt that the dynamic observed by the
authors is the radiation into several ecoptypes starting
from a single (pre-evolved) clone. There is a considerable
amount of literature that describes this dynamic both in
theory and in simulations as well as in digital life experiments, but the authors seem to be completely ignorant
about this vast literature. I am referring to the process of
adaptive radiation via negative frequency-dependent
selection, as discussed by Doebeli and Dieckmann (see, e,

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/11

g, Nature 400 (1999) 354). This process has been studied
extensively by our group in digital organisms (see Science
305 (2004) 83, and in particular the references to negative
frequency-dependent selection in there). Perusing the latter reference will also convince the authors that this is not
the first time that the emergence of new species (more
properly termed ecotypes) has been observed without a
previous explicit determination of those species in a computational system. In fact, it can be argued that this was
first seen in Tom Ray's experiments.
Authors' response
We reply to this comment in the reply to the one after the
next comment, because the two comments closely hang
together.

In order to test that adaptive radiation has truly created
stable ecotypes, you usually need to test that the ecosystem is stable when the mutation rate is reduced to zero. I
believe that the authors will see this, but they have not
performed the test.
Authors' response
Setting the mutation rate to zero aims to distinguish
between the diversity continuously introduced by mutation
(as in the genetic diversity within a quasi-species) and the
diversity sustained by the ecological functionality of different species. In this study, we established that the diversity
evolved in the model is maintained by the ecological difference among species through various methods such as phylogeny, sequence logo and the evolutionary analysis of
sequences. Furthermore, setting the mutation rate to zero in
the current model causes the side effects that directly affect
the interactions among species, namely, effective dilution
and greater catalyst diversity (please see also "Effect of the
mutation rate on the evolution"). These side effects make
this test ambiguous. Because of these two reasons, we did
not use this test in the current study (but please see below).
Finally, we would like to mention that such side effects –
narrowing the "width" of quasi-species distribution by setting mutation rate to zero affects the population dynamics
at ecological time scale – can happen in wider classes of ecological systems (e.g., see van der Laan and Hogeweg
(1994) Proc R Soc Lond B 259:35).

Upon the reviewer's comment, we nevertheless examined
the case of zero mutation rate. Simulations were conducted
for μ = 0 by continuing the simulations in which four species evolved. Somewhat to our surprise, one case (out of the
5 different simulation series) showed the coexistence of four
genotypes. The ecological function of the four genotypes is
interpretable as the dominant catalyst, the parasite, the
escaping catalyst and the parasite to the escaping catalyst,
as in the system of the C- and the A-catalyst and the G- and
the U-parasite. The four genotypes are, however, much less

Page 16 of 20
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2008, 3:11

characterized by a single nucleotide type. Apart from this
case, three genotypes remained in one case, and two genotypes remained in three cases. In these latter four cases, the
ecological functionality of the surviving genotypes can be
characterized in a similar manner too. But their sequences
are often not dominated by a single nucleotide type either,
and their dangling-ends are not similar to each other
among the different simulation series. From these results,
an interesting observation can be made: The mutation
causes more extreme base composition in the evolving genotypes, making the genotypes of different species distinct.
Interestingly, this actually makes the evolving phenotypes
very similar among the different runs of evolutionary
dynamics.
We also have to strenuously object to the assertion,
expressed on p. 7 (Authors' note: this refers to the first paragraph of the section titled "Ecological organization of the replicator system"), that the C-catalyst and the A-catalyst are
exploiting the same resource (identified as "empty
space"). This comment underscores the extreme deficiencies in understanding the process of adaptive radiation.
Due to the competitive exclusion principle (also known as
Gause's principle), this is strictly forbidden. If two ecotypes exploit the same resource, then they compete
directly and only one can survive. Specifically, turning off
mutation will result in the emergence of a single clone. It
is quite clear that the limiting resource for the C-and the
A-catalyst is the presence of C- and A-catalysts themselves.
The represent different (limited) resources, and thus they
can coexist. Note that the waves that the authors see are
just those predicted from "invasion when rare". Note also
that the destruction of the ecosystem when the population is well-mixed is also observed in the bacterial experiments of Rainey and Travisano, Nature 394 (1998) 69.
(However, this is not necessary, as seen in Chow et al., Science 305 (2004).)
Authors' response
First of all, we would like to explain that the coexistence
mechanism suggested by the reviewer is incorrect. While
the catalyst may be considered as the resource of itself in the
sense that it is the "catalytic (and template) resource", this
type of resource crucially differs from the resource in the
usual sense of the word. Usually, the resource is depleted as
a population grows as is the case in the reviewer's study
[34]. This means that there is a negative feedback between
the size of the population and the abundance of the
resource. But the resource in the sense of catalysts and templates is not depleted, but actually increases, as the catalyst
population grows. Thus, there is a positive feedback between
the population size and the abundance of the resource.
Therefore, using a different catalytic resource cannot by
itself enables the coexistence of different species. Instead, it
is more helpful to see that all replicators compete for one

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/11

and the same resource (empty space). From this point of
view, we explained that the coexistence of the two catalytic
species were mediated by the preferential parasitism and
spatial pattern formation.
Related to the above argument is the crucial difference
between the diversification happening in the current model
and that in the models cited by the reviewer. In the adaptive
dynamics model of Doebeli and Dieckmann [33] and the
Avida model of the reviewer [34], the diversification happens as the radiation of a population into the space of predefined ecological functionality, where having sufficiently
different functionality – i.e., consuming different resources
– enables a species to coexist with the others. In contrast,
the diversification in the current model happens through a
chain reaction of niche generation and speciation. The ecological functionality in the current model, such as a parasite
and an escaping catalyst, is not predefined, but is generated
by the evolved ecological organization. To explicitly explain
this crucial point, we have modified main text (especially in
Discussion).
Secondly, the reviewer implies that the effect of space in the
current model is parallel to that in Rainey and Travisano's
experiment. Although spatial heterogeneity was crucial for
the diversification in both studies, there is an important difference between the two. While in Rainey and Travisano's
experiment the environment is externally set to be spatially
heterogeneous (the title of their paper), in the current
model there is no preexisting environmental spatial heterogeneity. Instead, a population self-organizes into spatial
patterns, and it is this spontaneous pattern formation that
is crucial to the diversification (and maintenance) of the
current system.
Thirdly, we should add a few words on the competitive
exclusion principle. Firstly, a strict contradiction to the
principle exists as shown by Koch (J Theor Biol (1974)
44:387–397). Moreover, the principle ceases to hold if one
takes predation into account as shown by Cramer and May
(J Theor Biol (1972) 34:289–293), which is known as the
predator-mediated coexistence (Caswell (1978) Am Nat
112:127–154). The current model gives another such
example of coexistence mediated by the processes at other
ecological levels.
Finally, upon the reviewer's comment on Tom Ray's Tierra,
we added a paragraph to explicitly acknowledge his study in
relation to the current study.
The authors make an intriguing observation that seems to
contradict the paradigm of "survival of the flattest" (or,
evolution of mutational robustness). Again, no references
to a large and mature literature in this field, starting with

Page 17 of 20
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2008, 3:11

van Nimwegen, and continuing with Wilke et al (Nature
2001) and other references by Wilke, are made.
Besides the fact that the observation is made on p. 7 ("why
this is the case will become clear later"), and there is only
a single cryptic sentence at the bottom of p. 10 that we
could find that refers to this, the violation of mutational
robustness is very unclear. The sentence "Too high mutation rates make the G-parasite too weak to enable the Acatalyst to out-compete the C-catalyst" does not shed any
light on this mechanism at all. In fact, the entire section
"Dependence of speciation on mutation rate" is very
weak, with almost no mechanistic explanation. I think
that the dynamics that lead to an apparent violation (and
we insist "apparent", because of course this principle cannot be violated) of the mutational robustness paradigm
are potentially very interesting, because it points to the
mutualistic dependence on another genotype whose
robustness needs to be taken into account.
Authors' response
Let us begin with a general remark. Firstly, the evolution of
mutational robustness does not happen if the product of the
population size and the mutation rate is too small as shown
in Fig. 3 of van Nimwegen et al. (PNAS (1999)
96:9716). Secondly, the survival of the flattest does not
happen for a given mutation rate if the replication rate of
the flattest is too small compared with that of the fittest as
shown in Fig. 3(a) of [17]. This latter point explains why
the A-catalyst does not evolve instead of the C-catalyst for
higher mutation rates. We modified the text of "Effect of
the mutation rate on the evolution" to explain this more
clearly. We now also cite the studies by Eigen et al. [15]
(their Fig. 17 is of particular relevance) and by Wilke [17]
in main text.

A few observations on the calculation of informational
complexity. The numbers determined in the caption to
Figure 3 are never used in the text, even though a number
of interesting observations can be made using those numbers and the survival of the flattest effect. However, the
author would have to quantify the fitness of the catalysts
and parasites, which is in principle possible (but was not
carried out). The observation that informational complexity cannot be determined for an ecosystem is correct, and
constitutes a major problem. There are ways in which the
measure can be extended to cover different niches but
overlapping niches can still be a problem. This study
clearly shows the need for a mathematically sound extension of this measure, which is a problem we have been
working on for a while now.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/11

Authors' response
We are glad to share the view on the problem of physical
complexity. What exactly are the possible interesting observations?

The observation concerning "functional polymorphism
without speciation" is interesting, but it is not clear why it
is buried in an additional file. Again, this reflects poorly
on the structure of this paper. That the observed radiation
is actually a polymorphism can be shown by setting the
mutation rate to zero. The authors should do this.
Authors' response
First of all, we would like to note that this polymorphism
happens within one quasi-species without speciation. Thus,
this polymorphism is different from the diversification associated with speciation as observed in the other simulation
series.

Nevertheless, we also examined the case of μ = 0 in the system with polymorphism without speciation. The results
showed that four genotypes survived, where two genotypes
are catalytic, while the other two are non-catalytic (parasitic). The mechanism of their coexistence seems to be similar to that of the four species evolving in the simulations
with small mutation rates, in that one parasitic genotype
has slight preference to one catalyst both in its affinity to the
catalyst (G) and in its spatial distribution; so does the other
parasite to the other catalyst. The system, however, does not
clearly exhibit mutually invading wave patterns. To facilitate future investigation, we now list the genotype used to
initialize this simulation series and also the other four genotypes in Additional file 3.
Finally, we are missing an analysis of the evolutionary
dynamics along the line of descent, as is now standard in
computational evolution.
Authors' response
Because of computational overload, we used the phylogenetic method. To infer the evolutionary relationship, the
ancestor tracing is of course the best, and it can give much
more information. But, since we were able to make a sufficient analysis of evolutionary dynamics through the other
methods for our sake, we did not perform the ancestor tracing.

A few more points:
1. In a system with, say, 6 nucleotides, could 6 phenotypes
evolve? If the ecosystem is limited by the number of
nucleotides, then it is not clear whether the observation of
an emergent ecosystem has anything to do with the complexity of an RNA world, in particular because we assume

Page 18 of 20
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2008, 3:11

that the mutation rate is high, and no ecosystem evolves
at high rates.
Authors' response
We do not know if 6 phenotypes evolve. We, however,
would like to note that it was unexpected that the evolved
sequence strategies specialized on specific nucleotide types.
If the mutation rate is much smaller than those used in this
paper, the strategies of catalysts and parasites are not anymore simply describable as C or G, because the sequence
patterns temporally keep on changing (however, the results
in this parameter region are not reported in detail).

Furthermore, the specialization of species on specific nucleotide types is due to the simple interaction rules employed
in the current model, and thus we do not claim that exactly
the same sequence strategies would evolve in the RNA
world. If more complex interaction rules are employed, we
expect that the results would differ (please see also our reply
to Dr. Szathmáry's comment).
The current study showed that high mutation rates prohibit
the evolution of complex ecological organization. This could
be a potential problem for the evolution of complexity in
prebiotic evolution in addition to the error-threshold.
2. Figure 2(a) has many dangling ends with a majority of
both C's and G's, suggesting both C-catalysts and C-parasites. Yet it is described as only consisting of C-catalysts.
The same goes for some of the cluster in the (b), (c) and
(d), also with A-catalysts and U-parasites mingling. To
what degree do C-catalysts "tend" to appear cyan, etc?
Authors' response
The non-catalytic genotypes in Fig. 2(a) do not constitute a
separate parasitic lineage, but are members of the quasispecies of the C-catalyst. To clarify this point we have added
explanation in several places throughout main text. For the
color coding, we added insets and more explanation in Fig.
2.

3. It would also be nice with a short explanation of what
"secondary structure in Shapiro's notation" means. Also,
why not plot the secondary structure of the sequences in
Fig. 3? We tried to first construct them from the parenthesis notation, and after this did not work out we figured
we'd plot them using the RNAplot routine of the Vienna
package, but it did not install properly on the Mac. We
don't think this is too much to ask.
Authors' response
An example of the catalytic secondary structure is shown in
Fig. 1. We now mention this fact in main text.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/11

4. What is the meaning of "temporarily unstable"? (Additional file 2) Does it re-enter a period of stability after having been unstable for a while?
Authors' response
One of the parasite species dies out once in a while, but the
secondary parasite recurrently evolves during the same simulation.

5. It would be nice to see an animation of the wave-fronts
as in Figure 4. This would be a good use of "additional
files".
Authors' response
We added a movie file (Additional file 1).

6. Figure 6(e). By what number does the number of species fluctuate for intermediate mutation rates?
Authors' response
The polymorphic catalyst species is counted as one species.
There can be one or two parasite species. Thus, the number
fluctuates between 2 and 3.

In general, do not use the word "duality". There is really
no meaning in this word here. Use "interplay between
information and robustness" instead. The first sentence of
the results section really is completely empty as it stands
(although we know what the authors mean by it).
Authors' response
We deleted the word "duality of information and organization." However, instead of the suggested expression, we now
use "interdependence of information and organization."
