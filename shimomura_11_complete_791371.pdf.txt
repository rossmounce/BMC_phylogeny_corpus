Abstract
Background: Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (SDSE) causes invasive streptococcal infections, including
streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS), as does Lancefield group A Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS). We
sequenced the entire genome of SDSE strain GGS_124 isolated from a patient with STSS.
Results: We found that GGS_124 consisted of a circular genome of 2,106,340 bp. Comparative analyses among
bacterial genomes indicated that GGS_124 was most closely related to GAS. GGS_124 and GAS, but not other
streptococci, shared a number of virulence factor genes, including genes encoding streptolysin O, NADase, and
streptokinase A, distantly related to SIC (DRS), suggesting the importance of these factors in the development of
invasive disease. GGS_124 contained 3 prophages, with one containing a virulence factor gene for streptodornase.
All 3 prophages were significantly similar to GAS prophages that carry virulence factor genes, indicating that these
prophages had transferred these genes between pathogens. SDSE was found to contain a gene encoding a
superantigen, streptococcal exotoxin type G, but lacked several genes present in GAS that encode virulence factors,
such as other superantigens, cysteine protease speB, and hyaluronan synthase operon hasABC. Similar to GGS_124,
the SDSE strains contained larger numbers of clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)
spacers than did GAS, suggesting that horizontal gene transfer via streptococcal phages between SDSE and GAS is
somewhat restricted, although they share phage species.
Conclusion: Genome wide comparisons of SDSE with GAS indicate that SDSE is closely and quantitatively related
to GAS. SDSE, however, lacks several virulence factors of GAS, including superantigens, SPE-B and the hasABC
operon. CRISPR spacers may limit the horizontal transfer of phage encoded GAS virulence genes into SDSE. These
findings may provide clues for dissecting the pathological roles of the virulence factors in SDSE and GAS that
cause STSS.

Background
Since Lancefield group G streptococci (GGS) have been
considered components of the normal flora of the
human throat, skin, and genitourinary tract, the contributions of GGS to streptococcal disease have often been
overlooked [1]. Over the last decade, however, infections
by pathogenic GGS have been reported, including life* Correspondence: takiyam@ri.ncgm.go.jp

threatening invasive b-hemolytic streptococcal disease
[1-7], making it necessary to expand our knowledge of
the pathogenesis of GGS infections, especially invasive
infections. Several species of streptococci can carry
group C and G antigens, including Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (SDSE), S. canis, S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae, S. equi subsp. equi (SESE),
S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus (SESZ), and S. anginosus

group G and C bacteria, in a ratio of about 4:1 [3,8,9],

other GGS and GCS species. For example, of 313 strains
of GCS and GGS isolated from clinical samples in
Southern India between 2006 and 2007, 254 (81.1%)
were SDSE [9], as were 80% of the 266 invasive non-A
and non-B b-hemolytic streptococcal isolates in the
USA [3]. The spectrum and clinical courses of SDSE
infection, including pharyngitis, cellulitis, infective
arthritis, vertebral osteomyelitis, and streptococcal toxic
shock syndrome (STSS), show substantial overlap with
those of GAS [10-16]. Despite the increased clinical
importance of SDSE, however, the entire SDSE genome
has not yet been sequenced. Knowledge of its entire
genome sequence is fundamental to gain insights into
the pathogenicity of SDSE. We describe here the entire
genome sequence of a Lancefield group G SDSE strain,
GGS_124, which had been isolated from a patient with
STSS.

Results
Selection of an SDSE isolate for genome sequencing

We chose a clinical isolate of SDSE, strain GGS_124, for
genome sequence determination for several reasons.
First, GGS_124 belongs to Lancefield group G, to which
most clinical isolates of SDSE also belong [3,8,9]. Second, GGS_124 caused STSS in a patient. Third,
GGS_124 was the most virulent strain among 8 group
G SDSE isolates, as determined by their LD50 values in
a mouse infection model (Table 1).
Overview of the SDSE GGS_124 genome sequence

We found that, similar to other streptococcal genomes,
the SDSE GGS_124 genome consists of a single circular
chromosome of 2,106,340 bp (Additional file 1) and has
a G+C content of 39.6% (Figure 1). Based on its location
in the intergenic region upstream of the dnaA gene
(SDEG_0001), the GC skew, and the clustering of dnaA
box motifs, the start point of the SDSE GGS_124 genome was assigned to the putative origin of replication

(oriC). An AT-rich 13-mer (AGTCTGTTTTTTT),
located in the intergenic region upstream of the dnaA
gene [17], was selected as the starting point for nucleotide numbering. The GGS_124 genome was shown to
contain 2095 predicted coding sequences (CDS), which
account for 1.83 Mbp (86.9%) of the genome. In addition, this genome was shown to harbor 3 prophage-like
elements, designated FGGS_124.1, FGGS_124.2, and
FGGS_124.3. Moreover, there were 27 insertion
sequence (IS) elements throughout the genome.
Genome sequence homology analysis of GGS_124
with the other 11 sequenced streptococcal species and
subspecies showed that GGS_124 was closest in
sequence to GAS, with 72% similarity (Additional file 1).
GGS_124 was less similar to SESZ and SESE, with 65%
and 64% coverage. Although S. agalactiae is the closestrelati1ve of SDSE based on 16S rRNA analysis, the S.
agalactiae strains were less similar to SDSE than GAS
based on the genome wide comparison (Additional file
1). In addition, we constructed a phylogenetic tree of all
sequenced Streptococcus species based on the neighborjoining method (Additional file 2). Although neighborjoining methods are less accurate than the other methods such as most likelihood methods, SDSE is clustered
with the GAS strains as their closest relative.
We compared the gene organization of GGS_124 with
that of GAS by genomic rearrangement analyses (Figure
2 and Additional file 3). GAS could be divided roughly
into 2 groups according to the orientation of the genes
[18,19]. Therefore, SSI-1 and MGAS315, both of which
are M3 serotype strains and have opposite gene orientations from each other, were chosen for the analysis. We
found that the GGS_124 genome was organizationally
more similar to that of GAS strain MGAS315 than GAS
strain SSI-1 (Figure 2). Interestingly, the colinearity of
GGS_124 and S. uberis genomes was quite remarkable
but the percent amino acid identity was lower than that
of the GAS strains (Additional file 3). The gene structure of GGS_124 was similar to the structures of GAS
strain SSI-1, SESZ strain MGCS10565, and SESE strain
4047, although the GGS_124 genome contains largescale genomic rearrangements. The GGS_124 genome
differed markedly in gene organization from the genome
of GBS strain A909.
When we compared genes from GGS_124 and two
relatively homologous species, GAS (MGAS315) and
SESZ (MGCS10565) (Figure 3), we found that these
three streptococcal genomes contain more than 1,200
orthologous genes, accounting for 59% of the total CDSs
of GGS_124. GGS_124 shares 282 genes with MGAS315
and 153 genes with MGCS10565. Moreover, 71.6% of
the genes of GGS_124 were homologous to GAS genes,
with 88.5% amino acid identity, whereas 66.5% of
GGS_124 genes were homologous to MGCS10565

genes, with 79.9% amino acid identity. These findings
indicate that SDSE is closely related to GAS in both
nucleotide and amino acid sequences.
We also analyzed the distribution of genes shown to be
more homologous to genes derived from bacteria other
than GAS (Additional file 4). We found that 299 genes
showed higher similarity to genes from Streptococci other

than GAS and 92 genes showed higher similarity to
genes from a genus other than Streptococcus. In addition,
we identified 11 genes that did not show significant
homology to any genes in the databases. These genes
were scattered throughout the entire GGS_124 genome,
suggesting that they had not been acquired by massive
genome recombination.

(i) Prophage GGS_124.1

We found that all three prophage-like elements of
GGS_124 were homologous to previously sequenced
GAS prophages, and that they were integrated at sites
similar to those of GAS strains, with the same upstream
and downstream genes (Figure 4).

We found that the FGGS_124.1 prophage is 35.593 bp
in length with a G+C content of 38.04% and carries 60
CDS. Ninety-seven percent of the CDS in FGGS_124.1
have homologues, with more than 40% identity to GAS
prophages, suggesting that FGGS_124.1 is a chimeric

which contain the prophage elements F10394.6, carrying

[18,19,21,22]. No known prophage-associated virulence
factor genes were found in FGGS_124.2.

phage. This prophage was inserted at the predicted bacteriophage T12att site, which has been shown to be a
gene that encodes a serine tRNA and is located between
the CDS of SDEG_1100 and SDEG_1161 [20]. Six
GAS strains, MGAS10394, MGAS315, MGAS5005,
MGAS6180, MGAS8232, and SSI-1, have prophage
elements: F10394.3, which carries speK and the streptococcal phospholipase A2 gene (sla); F315.2, which carries ssa; F5005.1, which carries speA; F6180.1, which
carries the speC and Dnase (spd) genes; F8232.3, which
carries speL and speM; and SPsP5, which carries speC,
respectively [18,21-25]. In addition, FGGS_124.1 was
found to contain a prophage-associated virulence factor
gene for deoxyribonuclease (sdc).
(ii) Prophage GGS_124.2

We found that the FGGS_124.2 prophage is 35,814 bp in
length, with a G+C content of 38.20% and 61 CDS.
Ninety-five percent of the CDS in FGGS_124.1 have
homology with genes in GAS prophages, making it likely
that FGGS_124.2 is chimeric phage. The chromosomal
phage attachment site (attB) and the FGGS_124.2
phage-encoded attachment site (attP) were not found,
but the products of attP/attB recombination, attL and
attR, with the same sequences as those of GAS prophages
SPsP2 and F315.5 were identified. The genome context
around the integration site for FGGS_124.2 was found to
be conserved at the phage integration sites of 4 GAS

We also found a prophage remnant, FGGS_124.3,
which was about 12.6 kb length and homologous to the
previously sequenced GAS prophage remnants F6180.4
and F10270.5 with a nucleotide identity of 73%.
FGGS_124.3 and the two GAS phage remnants were
found to be located between genes encoding a putative
transcriptional regulator protein and the 30S ribosomal
protein. In strain GGS_124, two truncated transposase
proteins, SDEG_2117 and SDEG_2118, were found to
be inserted upstream of GGS_124.3. No virulence factor
genes are present in GGS_124.3.
Prokaryotes possess a system that mediates resistance
to infection by foreign DNA, such as viruses [26,27].
When bacteria are exposed to phages, short fragments
derived from phage DNA are integrated into clusters of
regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)
regions of the bacterial genome as spacers [27]. CRISPR
RNA transcripts and CRISR-associated proteins (Cas),
act in complexes to interfere with virus proliferation
[26]. This system has also been observed in GAS [20],
SESZ [22,28], S. mutans [29], and S. thermophilus [30].
GGS_124 harbors a CRISPR/Cas system consisting of an
array of genes, can1, cas1, cas2, and csn2, and CRISPR
(Figure 5). The GGS_124 CRISPR has 19 direct repeats
of 36 bp each and 18 spacer sequences 30 or 32 bp in
length; 6 of these sequences are homologous to GAS
prophage sequences, with more than 80% coverage
(Additional file 5). When we analyzed the number
of CRISPR spacers in an additional 7 SDSE isolates
(Table 2), we found that the mean number of CRISPR
spacers was higher in SDSE (18.0 ± 3.3 spacers) than in
GAS strains (4.0 ± 1.0 spacers; range, 0 to 9) (Table 2).
These results suggest that prophage infection of SDSE is
somewhat restricted, resulting in a smaller number of
virulence factors located in the prophage regions of
SDSE. Alternatively, SDSE may be in contact with
phages more frequently, with integrated phages having a
fitness cost for SDSE.
Virulence factors encoded by the GGS_124 genome

An analysis of 58 SDSE strains isolated from human
infections using targeted microarrays containing 216
GAS virulence genes composed of 70mer oligonucleotides showed that about 50% of the GAS virulence genes
represented in the microarray were present in SDSE
[31]. Three molecular markers, speB, the intergenic
region upstream of the scpG gene and virPCR, have

been shown helpful in discriminating between GAS and
SDSE [32]. Based on homology analyses with known
bacterial virulence factors, such as pore-forming toxins,
a superantigen, proteases, FCT-like regions, adhesins,
hyaluronidase, and a nuclease, we identified 71 putative
virulence factor genes in the GGS_124 genome; their
details are shown in Additional file 6. Comparison of
the virulence factors in GGS_124 with those of other
streptococcal species indicated that the putative virulence factors most similar to those of GGS_124 were
found in GAS. In contrast, superantigen, SPE-B and the
has operon of GAS are not conserved in GGS_124.
(i). Pore-forming toxins

GGS_124 has several putative hemolysins, including
HlyX (SDEG_0427), HlyIII (SDEG_1015), and HlyA1
(SDEG_1483), which have also been detected in GAS,
SESZ, SESE, S. uberis, and GBS. GGS_124 also has

genes encoding streptolysin S (sagA) (SDEG_0705) and
its biosynthesis proteins (sagBCDEFGHI) (SDEG_0706
to 0713), which are also present in GAS [33], SESZ, and
SESE [22,28,34]. In addition, GGS_124 carries a gene for
streptolysin O (SLO) (SDEG_2027), which is essential
for GAS virulence and is required for the organism to
escape from the endosome into the cytosol following
invasion of host cells [35].
(ii). Superantigen

GGS_124 possesses only one superantigen gene,
exotoxin G variant 4 (spegg4), which is homologous to
GAS streptococcal exotoxin G (SpeG), with 79% amino
acid identity (Additional file 6). In a previous analysis of
the superantigenic activities of the spegg4 product in
human peripheral blood mononuclear cells [36], we
found that its mitogenic activity was about 1% that of
SpeG from GAS. Other genome-encoded superantigen

genes for mitogenic exotoxin Z (smeZ), which are present in GAS [37], were not found in the GGS_124
genome.
(iii) Proteases

Figure 5 CRISPR/Cas system structures found in SDSE isolates.
The CRISPR structures of SDSE isolates were analyzed by direct
sequencing of PCR-amplified CRISPR regions. The repeat-spacer
regions (CRISPR) are enlarged. Open circles marked “R” are direct
repeats, whereas the square boxes indicate respective spacers with
numbers. GGS_124 contained only CRISPR1, whereas some of the
other strains also contained CRISPR2 (Table 2).

We found that a putative proteinase (SDEG_1906) and
streptococcal C5a peptidase (scpB) (SDEG_0933) [38]
were conserved among GGS_124 and 5 closely related
species. GGS_124 also has a gene with homology (42%
amino acid identity) to exfoliative toxin A of Staphylococcus aureus strain Mu50 (SAV1173), which causes staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome [39]. GGS_124 also
carries a gene for streptokinase (SDEG_0233), similar to
streptokinase A of GAS, with 88% amino acid identity
(Additional file 6). This protein complexes with plasminogen to form an activator, which has serine protease
activity and cleaves free plasminogen. leading to activation of the zymogen [40]. Strikingly, GGS_124 lacks
streptococcal cysteine protease (SpeB), an erythrogenic
toxin produced by GAS with cysteine protease activity
[41]. The GGS_124 genome lacks approximately 7 kb of

the GAS strain MGAS315 sequence, including genes
encoding SpeB (SpyM3_1742), the transcriptional regulator RopB (SpyM3_1744), and mitogenic factor 25K
precursor (SpyM3_1745). Since several transposase and
related genes (SDEG_0212, 0206, 0205, 0201, 0194) are
located in the corresponding region, it is highly likely
that the region that included speB was present in the
common ancestor of GAS and SDSE but was not
retained by SDSE after speciation.
We found that speB was not present in GGS_124, in
agreement with the results of a microarray study, which
showed that all of the 58 examined strains of group C
and G SDSE isolated from patients lacked the speB gene
[31,32]. We therefore examined whether SDSE strains
have protease activity similar to that of SpeB (Additional
file 7). We did not detect any SpeB-like protease activity
in strains GGS_124 or GGS_118, which had been
isolated from two patients with STSS. In contrast, a
GAS strain produced a proteinase that was sensitive to
E-64, which inhibits cysteine proteases, including SpeB.
(iv) FCT-like regions

Recently, GAS and GBS were shown to express pili, which
are synthesized by proteins encoded by genes in FCT
regions [1,42,43]. GGS_124 harbors 2 FCT-like regions,
which are probable operons expressing different pilus-like
structures (Figure 6). One of these contains genes encoding the transcriptional regulator RofA (SDEG_0156), two
putative fimbrial structural subunit proteins (SDEG_0157
and SDEG_0158), two sortases (SDEG_0159 and

Page 8 of 17

SDEG_0160), and a putative fibronectin binding protein
(SDEG_0161). It is similar to the FCT-6 region, which is
conserved among M2 GAS, GBS, and SESZ [22,42,44].
The second region contains genes encoding a putative
transcriptional regulator (SDEG_1782), a defective
collagen binding protein (SDEG_1781), a signal peptidase
I (SDEG_1780), a backbone protein (SDEG_1779), and an
ancillary protein (SDEG_1778). It is similar to the FCT-3
region, which was found in M3, M5, M18, and M49 GAS
[43].
(v) Adhesins

GGS_124 possesses genes that encode putative adhesion
proteins, including proteins similar to putative fibronectin binding proteins (SDEG_0161, 1263, and 1984), pullulanase (SDEG_0237), phosphopyruvate hydratase
(SDEG_0704), laminin binding protein (SDEG_0935),
internalin protein (SDEG_1372), and collagen binding
protein (SDEG_1781), all of which bind to the extracellular matrix (Additional file 6). SGGS_124 also possesses
genes encoding immunoglobulin G binding protein
(SDEG_1358) [45] and multifunctional streptococcal
plasmin receptor (Plr)/streptococcal surface dehydrogenase (SDH)/glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH), which binds to complement component C5a
(SDEG_1936) [46] (Additional file 6), although the
product of SDEG_1936 lacks a signal peptide.
(vi) Hyaluronan capsule synthesis

Hyaluronic acid (HA), synthesized via the hasABC operon,
is considered a pleiotropic virulence factor involved in

Figure 6 Organization of genes encoding pilus-like structure proteins in S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis GGS_124. The organizations of
genes encoding pilus-like structure proteins in GGS_124 were compared with those in GAS and SESZ. Colored boxes between genes indicate
similarity at the amino acid level (red, ≥90%; orange, 90%-80%; yellow-green, 79%-70%; green, 69%-60%; purple, 59%-40%; gray, <40%).

Shimomura et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:17
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/17

many aspects of GAS infection [47]. GGS_124, however,
does not contain an hasABC operon, in contrast to the
genomes of GAS, SESZ, SESE, and S. uberis. Rather,
GGS_124 possesses only one gene, encoding glycosyl transferase (SDEG_0628), which shows a low level of similarity
to hasA of GAS (20% amino acid similarity). Although one
SDSE strain has been shown to possess a hyaluronan
synthase (AF023876.1), very similar to the product of hasA
[48], GAS gene microarray analysis of 58 SDSE strains isolated from human infections showed that all harbored only
hasC [31]. We found that GGS_124 also harbors only hasC
(SDEG_1980) (Additional file 6), making it unlikely that
SDSE produces HA via the hasABC operon.
(vii) Hyaluronidase

GGS_124 possesses a gene in a non-prophage region of
the genome that encodes a putative hyaluronidase
(SDEG_0654), with 66% identity to hylB in SESZ (Additional file 6). Hyaluronidase in GAS is thought to contribute to the spread of bacteria in tissues and may allow
GAS to utilize host hyaluronic acid or its own capsule as
an energy source [49]. The hyaluronidase in GGS_124
may have a function similar to that in GAS.
(viii) Nucleases

GGS_124 possesses 5 genes that encode putative nucleases
with a secretion signal peptide: genome-encoded streptodornase (SDEG_0541), extracellular nuclease (SDEG_0714),
DNA-entry nuclease (SDEG_0732), cell surface 5’-nucleotidase (SDEG_0825), and prophage-associated deoxyribonuclease (SDEG_1103), all of which are predicted to code for
a secretion signal peptide. Two of them, SDEG_0714 and
SDEG_0825, code for potential cell wall anchor motifs,
LPKAG and LPMAG, respectively (Additional file 6). The
putative streptodornase SDEG_0541 and DNA-entry nuclease SDEG_0732 are homologous to phage-encoded extracellular streptodornase D Sda1 of GAS (PHA01790) [50]
and DNA-entry nuclease EndA of S. pneumoniae TIGR4
(SP_1964) [51], respectively (Additional file 6). Sda1 and
EndA have been found to degrade neutrophil extracellular
traps (NETs) [50,51], which are composed of granule proteins and chromatin released by neutrophils and can catch
and kill surrounding bacteria [52]. The putative extracellular DNase SDEG_0714 is similar to M1 GAS cellwall-located DNase SpnA (Spy0747), which has been
reported important for virulence, e.g., dispersion in host tissue [53] (Additional file 6).

Page 9 of 17

Streptococcal inhibitor of complement (SIC) and distantly related to SIC (DRS) are some extent of homology. DRS binds complement factors but does not inhibit
complement mediated cell lysis [56,57], whereas SIC
inhibits complement mediated cell lysis [58]. GGS_124
harbors a putative DRS gene (SDEG_0932), which consists of a signal sequence, two repeat regions, and a proline-rich region typical of DRS, and is homologous to
the Drs12.04 protein of GAS strain emm12 with 48%
amino acid identity [59] (Additional file 6).
The GGS_124 genome harbors a gene encoding
a collagen-like protein (SDEG_1113), similar to the
collagen-like repeat phage protein of SESE 4047
(SEQ_0837), with 41% amino acid identity. Streptococcal
collagen-like proteins (Scl) are cell-surface molecules of
GAS with domains containing tracks of repeated GlyXaa-Yaa sequences that form a mammalian collagen-like
triple-helical structure. These proteins mediate the
internalization of GAS into human cells upon binding of
Scl to the human collagen receptor integrin [60]. The
GGS_124 gene encoding collagen-like protein does not
contain a signal peptide or LPXTG motif, suggesting
that the gene product may not be expressed on the cell
surface. In contrast, GGS_124 does not harbor genes
encoding proteins similar to the other collagen-like proteins (sclA and sclB) in GAS.
NAD glycohydrolase (SDEG_2029), which is located in
the NADase-streptolysin O operon of the GAS genome
[61], was found to be conserved in the same operon in
GGS_124 (Additional file 6). This enzyme is expressed
after streptolysin O is injected into host cells and accelerates cell death [61,62].
(x) Distribution of virulence factors among Streptococci

We also assessed the presence or absence of representative
virulence factors among sequenced streptococcal species,
including GAS (MGAS315), SESE (4047), SESZ
(MGCS10565), GBS (A909), and S. uberis (0140J) (Additional file 8). Among 30 virulence factors, most of those
located in the core genome, but not those located in streptococcal phages, are conserved in GGS_124, except for
speB. In contrast, other streptococci lack genes encoding
streptolysin O, NAD glycohydrolase and DRS (or SIC),
suggesting the importance of these proteins in the pathogenicity of SDSE and GAS in humans, causing STSS.

(ix) Other virulence factors

Putative virulence factors unique to SDSE

GGS_124 possesses genes encoding the multifunctional
M protein (stg480.0) (SDEG_0230). The M protein of
GAS shows antiphagocytic and adhesin activities,
whereas the adhesion function of the GGS M protein
may be due to a collagen binding motif [54,55]. Since
the product of Stg480.0 lacks this motif, the M protein
of GGS_124 may not act as an adhesin.

We identified 20 gene products in GGS_124 containing
signal peptides and LPXTG cell wall surface anchor
motifs that showed low similarity to known proteins.
Using PCR, we analyzed the distributions of these putative virulence factors in 8 SDSE isolates (Table 3
arranged according to their decreasing lethality in mice).

(SDEG_0158), encoded in the FCT-6-like region in
GGS_124, was detected in the 3 most virulent strains,
GGS_124, GGS_168, and GGS_117. In both GGS_168
and GGS_117, the FCT-6-like region was not detected
by PCR (data not shown). Interestingly, the SDEG_1601
gene encoding a functionally unknown hypothetical protein was amplified in isolates that cause STSS. However,
no virulence factors associated with mouse lethality or
Lancefield groups were found.
Relatedness of emm type and pathogenicity in SDSE

Particular M (or emm) types of GAS have been associated with certain streptococcal diseases [63]. In investigating the pathogenic traits of M4, M12, M1, and M3
GAS clinical isolates in a murine model [64], we found
that murine lethality was closely associated with M type.
The M1 and M3 types of GAS, which are isolated at
high frequency from patients with STSS, showed higher
virulence in mice than did M12 and M4. Using this
mouse model, we assessed the virulence of the emm
types of 8 group G SDSE isolates to analyze whether
most frequent emm-type of isolates in epidemiological
studies (see below) are more virulent in mice (Table 1).
We found that the lethality in mice of these isolates was
not associated with their isolation from patients with
STSS or with the frequently isolated emm-type in
humans such as stG10.0 and stG643.0 (see below). To
determine whether the emm type of SDSE was associated with pathogenicity in humans, we reviewed the
epidemiological data regarding the isolation frequencies
of GCS and GGS in relation to their emm types
[3,6,7,65,66] (Additional file 9). We found that stG10.0
was the most frequent emm type in Portugal and Japan,
stG643.0 was the most frequent in western Norway, and
stG6.0 was the most frequent in the USA. When we calculated the degree of correspondence among the isolation rates of emm types in each area using the Kendall
tau rank correlation coefficient, we found no significant
correlations among all regions (data not shown), suggesting that there is no linkage between emm type of
SDSE and infectivity in humans or mice.

Discussion
Comparative analysis of Streptococcus 16S rRNA
sequences had indicated that SDSE was more closely
related to GBS than to GAS [67,68]. In contrast, we
found that SDSE, which belongs to Lancefield groups C
and G [3,65], is more closely related to GAS than to
other sequenced streptococci based on genome wide
and gene level comparisons
SDSE is known to cause diseases very similar to those
caused by GAS, such as pharyngitis, cellulitis, infective
arthritis, vertebral osteomyelitis, and STSS [10-16].
This similarity may be due, at least in part, to their

Page 12 of 17

conservation of a large number of genes for virulence
factors. Figure 7 shows a summary of putative virulence
factors and proposed virulence functions in SDSE. SDSE
shares most of the virulence factor genes of GAS, including streptolysin O, streptokinase, FCT-like regions,
NADase, and DRS. However, GGS_124 and probably
almost all other SDSEs lack SpeB, superantigens except
for SpeG, and hyaluronan synthesis via hasABC [31]. As
spegg4, which has about 1% of the mitogenic activity of
GAS-derived SpeG, is the only gene encoding a protein
homologous to superantigens, and most SDSE isolates do
not harbor superantigen-like genes other than spegg
[31,69], it is highly unlikely that superantigens play a
significant role in the pathogenesis of SDSE infection in
humans.
Particular M (or emm) types of GAS have been associated with certain streptococcal diseases [63]. We
therefore analyzed the virulence in a mouse model of
several SDSE strains bearing different emm-types, but
we were unable to find a significant correlation between
emm-type of SDSE and virulence. Further studies are
needed to provide further insight into the linkage
between emm type of SDSE and infectivity in humans.
Streptococcal phages are considered critical in horizontal gene transfer, especially in the transport of virulence
factors [28,70], in Streptococci. Three prophage elements
in GGS_124 were found to be homologous to GAS prophages in both nucleotide and amino acid sequences.
The positions of prophage insertion were also conserved
between GGS_124 and previously sequenced GAS prophages, suggesting that SDSE and GAS share the same
phage species, and that horizontal gene transfer between
SDSE and GAS has occurred. However, GGS_124 does
not contain prophages that encode genes for superantigens, Sla, or MF. These phage encoded genes were also
missing from all strains previously analyzed by a GAS
microarray [31]. Sdn is an exception, since it was
detected in 4 of these 58 SDSE strains [31]. These results
showed that SDSE may have some resistance to infection
by GAS phages carrying genes encoding virulence factors.
Prokaryotes possess the CRISPR/Cas system, which
mediates resistance to infection by foreign DNA, such as
viruses [26,27]. GGS_124 has a CRISPR/Cas system, designated CRISPR1/Cas, whereas the other SDSE isolates analyzed in this study had another CRISPR/Cas system,
designated CRISPR2/Cas. We found that SDSE strains
usually have a higher total number of spacers than GAS,
suggesting that prophage infection of SDSE was restricted
to some extent, resulting in a smaller number of virulence
factors located in the prophage regions of SDSE. Similar
restrictions were observed in SESZ when compared with
SESE. For example, the SESE 4047 genome, which contains no CRISPR, contains genes encoding virulence factors in prophage regions. In contrast, SESZ MGCS10565

Figure 7 Putative virulence factors and posited virulence function of SDSE. Cell-surface proteins, extracellular secreted proteins, metal
transporters, and the two-component regulator CsrR/CsrS, which affect the expression of approximately 10% of all genes in a GAS strain [78,79],
are shown. The putative virulence factors on the cell surface of SDSE are adhesins, including M protein, fibronectin binding protein (Fbp),
collagen binding protein (Cbp), laminin binding protein (Lbp), and pullulanase (Pul) [80]. Factors that protect bacteria from the host immune
system are shown, including cell envelope proteinase A (CepA), which cleaves within the interleukin-8 (IL-8) C-terminal a-helix [38];
immunoglobulin G binding protein (GB) [49]; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and C5a peptidase (Scp) [46]. Putative
pathogenic roles of the virulence factors of SDSE, including hyaluronidase (Hyl), streptokinase (Ska), extracellular nuclease and streptodornase
(DNase), which digest neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) released from dead neutrophils [50], and the pore-forming proteins, such as hemolysin
(Hly), streptolysin S (SLS), streptolysin O (SLO), and NAD glycohydrolase (NADase), are indicated. FtsABCD and HtsABC are ferrichrome
transporters and MtsABC is a metal transporter. Black arrows show protein secretion, red arrows show expression of genes regulated by CsrR,
blue arrows show protein attachment to the extracellular matrix, brown arrows show metal transport from the extracellular environment into the
cell, and purple arrows show degradation of extracellular matrix by secreted Hyl or Ska. The factors marked with a Stop sign, which are major
virulence factors of GAS, do not function in SDSE.

and H70, which contain 26 and 18 spacers, respectively, do
not carry any prophages. Thus, the CRISPR system in
streptococci sharing prophages may play a substantial role
in the spread of virulence factors among species. Alternatively, these virulence factors may not benefit to SDSE
during carriage or disease, such that the integration of
these specific phages is not selected for.

Conclusions
We have shown here that SDSE likely acts as a pathogen,
based on its genome sequence and close relationship with

GAS. As the frequency of isolation of SDSE from patients
has increased, it should not be overlooked as a source of
infection.

Methods
Bacterial strains

Three Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis
(SDSE) isolates, GGS_124, GGS_117, and GGS_118,
were obtained from 3 patients with STSS, and 5 SDSE
isolates were isolated from 5 patients with non-STSS
(Table 1). All SDSE isolates were classified as Lancefield

group G. Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS). NIH9 [71] was
used as the SpeB-producing strain.
emm typing

The emm types were classified according to a protocol
for emm typing of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/biotech/
strep/protocol_emm-type.htm.
SDSE infection in mice

All animal experiments were performed according to the
guidelines of the Ethics Review Committees of Animal
Experiments of Tokyo Women’s Medical University and
the National Center for Global Health and Medicine.
Virulence in mice was determined as described [64].
Briefly, LD50 values were determined by intraperitoneal
(i.p.) injection of each SDSE strain into 5 6-7 week old
female ddY mice.
Genome sequencing

We obtained draft contig data of GGS_124 from a commercial service (454 Life Sciences, Branford, CT), and
the gaps between the contigs were tiled by PCR after
closure to validate assembly using specific primers or by
primer walking and an ABI 3100 genetic analyzer
(Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA). The percentage of QV40+ bases, an index of the quality of data
from pyro-sequencing, was 99.87%. The genome
sequence of GGS_124 has been deposited in the DDBJ
database (accession no. AP010935).
Genome annotation and bioinformatics

Transfer RNAs (tRNAs), transfer-messenger RNA
(tmRNA), and rRNA sequences were predicted using
ARAGORN [72]. Coding sequences (CDS) were predicted using in silico Molecular Cloning (In Silico
Biology Inc., Yokohama City, Kanagawa, Japan) for
selection of optimal start sites. Predicted genes and
intergenic regions were compared using the NCBI
sequence database http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi,
and predicted CDS and start sites were adjusted accordingly. A genome-wide homology search was performed
using the discontiguous megaBLAST algorithm http://
blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi with a word size of 11
and rewards and penalties (2, -3) that optimize for alignments of about 85% identity. The phylogenetic tree of
all sequenced Streptococcus species was constructed
based on CVTree http://tlife.fudan.edu.cn/cvtree/[73].
Secretion signal peptides were predicted using SignalP
http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP[74]. Sortases and
cell wall sorting signals were predicted with available
hidden Markov models using HMMER http://bamics3.

sequenced Streptococcus was constructed based on the
CVTree http://tlife.fudan.edu.cn/cvtree/[73]
Detection and sequencing of CRISPRs and CRISPRassociated protein (Cas) genes in the 8 SDSE strains

CRISPRs and Cas genes in the SDSE strains were
detected by conventional PCR using ExTaq (Takara Bio
Inc., Otsu, Shiga, Japan) and the primers listed in Additional file 10. Template DNA was isolated as described
[64]. The PCR cycling conditions were 94°C for 2 min
followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 54°C for 30 s, and
72°C for 4 min, and a final extension at 72°C for 6 min.
The amplified CRISPR fragments were sequenced using
an ABI 3100 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems Inc.).
The CRISPR spacers were identified using CRISPR Finder http://crispr.u-psud.fr/[76]. The sequences of CRISPR
and the spacers have been deposited in the DDBJ database (accession numbers are listed in Table 2).
Determination of SpeB-like protease activity

SpeB-like protease activity was assayed as described [77],
with slight modifications. Briefly, DTT was added to bacterial culture supernatants to a final concentration of 10
mM and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. An equal amount
of 2 g/L azocasein was added, and incubation was continued for an Additional 30 min at 37°C. Trichloroacetic
acid was added to a final concentration of 5%, and incubation was continued for 15 min at 4°C. After centrifugation, an equal amount of 5 M NaOH was added to the
supernatant, and its absorbance at 450 nm was measured.
Distribution of putative virulence factors unique to
GGS_124 among the other SDSE

The distribution of putative virulence factors of
GGS_124 among SDSE strains was analyzed by conventional PCR using ExTaq (Takara Bio Inc.) and the
primers listed in Additional file 10. Template DNA
extraction and PCR were performed as described [64].
