Abstract
Background: Host-parasite interactions are among the most important biotic relationships. Host
species should evolve mechanisms to detect their enemies and employ appropriate
counterstrategies. Parasites, in turn, should evolve mechanisms to evade detection and thus
maximize their success. Females of the European beewolf (Philanthus triangulum, Hymenoptera,
Crabronidae) hunt exclusively honeybee workers as food for their progeny. The brood cells
containing the paralyzed bees are severely threatened by a highly specialized cuckoo wasp
(Hedychrum rutilans, Hymenoptera, Chrysididae). Female cuckoo wasps enter beewolf nests to
oviposit on paralyzed bees that are temporarily couched in the nest burrow. The cuckoo wasp larva
kills the beewolf larva and feeds on it and the bees. Here, we investigated whether H. rutilans evades
detection by its host. Since chemical senses are most important in the dark nest, we hypothesized
that the cuckoo wasp might employ chemical camouflage.
Results: Field observations suggest that cuckoo wasps are attacked by beewolves in front of their
nest, most probably after being recognized visually. In contrast, beewolves seem not to detect signs
of the presence of these parasitoids neither when these had visited the nest nor when directly
encountered in the dark nest burrow.
In a recognition bioassay in observation cages, beewolf females responded significantly less
frequently to filter paper discs treated with a cuticular extract from H. rutilans females, than to filter
paper discs treated with an extract from another cuckoo wasp species (Chrysis viridula). The
behavior to paper discs treated with a cuticular extract from H. rutilans females did not differ
significantly from the behavior towards filter paper discs treated with the solvent only.
We hypothesized that cuckoo wasps either mimic the chemistry of their beewolf host or their
host's prey. We tested this hypothesis using GC-MS analyses of the cuticles of male and female

beewolves, cuckoo wasps, and honeybee workers. Cuticle extracts of Hedychrum nobile
(Hymenoptera: Chrysididae) and Cerceris arenaria (Hymenoptera: Crabronidae) were used as
outgroups. There was little congruence with regard to cuticular compounds between H. rutilans
females and honeybees as well as females of C. arenaria and H. nobile. However, there was a
considerable similarity between beewolf females and H. rutilans females. Beewolf females show a
striking dimorphism regarding their cuticular hydrocarbons with one morph having (Z)-9-C25:1
and the other morph having (Z)-9-C27:1 as the major component. H. rutilans females were more
similar to the morph having (Z)-9-C27:1 as the main component.
Conclusion: We conclude that H. rutilans females closely mimic the composition of cuticular
compounds of their host species P. triangulum. The occurrence of isomeric forms of certain
compounds on the cuticles of the cuckoo wasps but their absence on beewolf females suggests that
cuckoo wasps synthesize the cuticular compounds rather than sequester them from their host.
Thus, the behavioral data and the chemical analysis provide evidence that a specialized cuckoo wasp
exhibits chemical mimicry of the odor of its host. This probably allows the cuckoo wasp to enter
the nest with a reduced risk of being detected by olfaction and without leaving traitorous chemical
traces.

Background
The interaction between hosts and parasites or parasitoids
is one of the most important forces driving evolutionary
and ecological processes [1]. In order to reduce the impact
of parasitoids, host species may evolve mechanisms to
detect their enemies and employ adequate counterstrategies [2-5]. Parasitoids, in turn, are selected to evolve mechanisms that reduce the probability of being detected by
their hosts to circumvent such countermeasures. This sets
the stage for repeated cycles of adaptations and counteradaptations ("evolutionary arms race" [6-10]) between
hosts and parasites, especially if the parasitoid is highly
specialized on a single host species and has a large impact
on host fitness [2,11,12].
Progeny of brood caring bees and wasps are particularly
susceptible to parasitism [13-15]. Females of these species
store large amounts of valuable nutrients as larval provisions in brood cells. These valuable resources attract a
variety of brood parasites, either cleptoparasites that
reduce the amount of resources available to the host's
progeny or parasitoids that obligatorily kill the host larvae. Mostly, females of these parasitic species have to enter
the nest or the brood cell to deposit eggs or larvae. Thus,
the traces that are left by female brood parasites might be
detected by the host. As a result, the hosts might abandon
the nests or remove or destroy eggs of brood parasites
[5,16]. Brood parasites might also be encountered in the
nest by the host and might be driven away, injured, or
even killed (E. Strohm, unpubl. observations). Since
insects heavily rely on their chemical senses for any kind
of recognition or localization process [1,17,18], concealment of a brood parasite's actual or previous presence will
require chemical camouflage (compounds sequestered
from the host or the host's nest) or chemical mimicry
(compounds synthesized by the mimic, definitions sensu

[19]). In this study, we investigated the interaction
between a hunting wasp, the European beewolf, Philanthus triangulum (Hymenoptera, Crabronidae) and its
highly specialized brood parasitoid Hedychrum rutilans
(Hymenoptera, Chrysididae). We investigated the following questions: Are cuckoo wasps (H. rutilans) detected and
recognized by beewolf females at all? Is there a difference
in host response towards the cuckoos outside and inside
the nest and do the cuticular hydrocarbons play a role for
the detection of the cuckoo wasps inside the nest? Is the
chemical composition of the cuticular hydrocarbons of H.
rutilans females similar to their host or to their host's prey?
Females of the European beewolf hunt honeybee workers
(Hymenoptera, Apidae) as food for their progeny. Several
paralyzed bees are temporarily couched in the main burrow (up to 1 m long) of the underground nest (see [20] for
details on nest architecture). Eventually, the female closes
the nest entrance, excavates a side burrow and a terminal
brood cell, brings in one to six paralyzed bees, and oviposits on one of the bees [21]. Thereupon, she carefully closes
the side burrow and subsequently has no contact to her
progeny.
The cuckoo wasp, H. rutilans, is a specialized brood parasitoid of the genus Philanthus [16,22]. However, since in
Central Europe only one member of the genus, P. triangulum, is fairly abundant, H. rutilans is effectively monospecific in this region. This considerable degree of
specialization is expressed by the unique oviposition strategy of H. rutilans. Most chrysidid wasps oviposit into the
brood cell of their hosts at a defined stage of the provisioning cycle or after the brood cell has been finally closed
[22]. In beewolves, however, the brood cell is excavated
only after the female has brought in the bees and the nest
entrance has been closed. Thus, the nest is blocked up and

the female is attendant until the brood cell is finally
closed. This leaves little opportunity for a cuckoo wasp to
deposit an egg in the brood cell. As a consequence, H. rutilans females pursue two alternative strategies. Either they
rapidly pounce and oviposit on a paralyzed bee when the
female alights with its prey and enters the burrow ([23], E.
Strohm unpubl. observation), or H. rutilans females wait
in front of the nest until the host female leaves to forage
and then enter the burrow and oviposit on the paralyzed
bees that are temporarily couched there [22]. Thus, H.
rutilans use the paralyzed bees as a Trojan horse to bring
the egg into the brood cell. The latter seems to be the
much more frequent mechanism. The mobile larva of H.
rutilans climbs onto the beewolf larva, kills it, and feeds
on the host larva and the bees. Thus, infestation by H. rutilans inevitably leads to a fitness reduction of the host. H.
rutilans is considered to be the most important brood parasite of P. triangulum. The rate of parasitism varies
between 3% and more than 30% ([4,24-26], E. Strohm,
unpubl. data). H. rutilans might even drive local aggregations of P. triangulum to extinction [25].

ula, and cuticular extracts of H. rutilans. We predicted that
beewolf females should ignore the discs treated with solvent only (negative control), they should respond to the
discs treated with C. viridula extract (positive control) and
they should not (or only weakly) respond to H. rutilans
extracts.

In both oviposition strategies, detection of the cuckoo
wasp female by the beewolf female might decrease the
cuckoo wasp's success. First, when encountered in the
nest, cuckoo wasps might be carried to the nest entrance
by beewolf females and thrown out [27]. Mostly, cuckoo
wasps are not severely harmed due to the solidity and
strong sculpturing of their cuticle and their ability to
adopt a rolled-up defensive posture that protects the most
vulnerable parts of the body (legs, mouthparts, antennae
[22,28]). Nevertheless, the wings are rather unprotected
and might be injured by a beewolf female. Second, if beewolves females detect signs of the presence of cuckoo
wasps they might remove bees from the nest that have
possibly been parasitized [25]. Thus, a cuckoo wasp
should avoid detection to minimize wastage of time and
investment. This means that cuckoo wasp females should
avoid detection when they are encountered by a host
female in the nest. However, it would probably be even
more important for the cuckoo wasps not to leave any
detectable traces of their presence when they had entered
the nest and oviposited on a paralyzed honeybee.

To assess both alternatives, we analyzed the composition
of cuticular compounds of beewolf females, cuckoo
wasps, and honeybees. Furthermore, we included beewolf
males as the a priori most similar group to beewolf females
and, thus, a crucial comparison for assessment of this
hypothesis. To control for the possibility that chrysidids
and crabronids have similar patterns of cuticular hydrocarbons by chance we also analyzed closely related species: the chrysidid wasp Hedychrum nobile and its
crabronid host Cerceris arenaria (subfamily Philanthinae,
a weevil hunting wasp). A reasonable null hypothesis for
the resemblance among the species under study might be
based on their phylogenetic relationship. Crabronids and
apids are closely related and constitute the superfamily
Apoidea, whereas chrysidids branch off very early [32,33].
Thus, the null hypothesis would predict that the cuticular
profiles of beewolf females should be most similar to conspecifics males and Cerceris females, fairly similar to honeybees, and least similar to cuckoo wasps. Accordingly
from a phylogenetic point of view, the chemical profiles
of the two congeneric chrysidid species should be most
similar to each other.

In order to assess whether beewolf females respond to the
presence of H. rutilans females at all we observed the
behavioral interactions outside of the nest. To test
whether H. rutilans females employ chemical camouflage
inside the nest we conducted to sets of behavioral experiments. First, in observation cages we recorded the interaction of the cuckoo wasps with beewolf females inside the
nest burrow. Second, we conducted a recognition bioassay by assessing the response of beewolf females
towards filter discs treated with different extracts: solvent
only, cuticular extracts of another chrysidid, Chrysis virid-

There are two evolutionary options for H. rutilans
femalesto avoid olfactory detection by beewolves. First,
cuckoo wasps could mimic the odor of the honeybees that
are temporarily couched in the main burrow. Second, H.
rutilans females might mimic their beewolf host. We consider the imitation of the cuticular compounds of the beewolf host the better alternative, since the host's
hydrocarbon profile can be found all over the nest walls
due to the digging activity (Kroiss and Strohm unpubl.
data) and also on the honeybees. This is because in order
to prevent the paralyzed bees from molding they are
treated by the beewolf females with a secretion from the
postpharyngeal gland that is identical to the beewolves'
cuticular hydrocarbons [29-31].

Results
Are cuckoo wasps detected by beewolf females outside the
nest?
Cuckoo wasps flew over the beewolf nesting site and selectively landed on the mounds of beewolf nests. During the
54 hours of observation we recorded 1024 landings of H.
rutilans on beewolf nest mounds. In 259 cases (25.3%),
cuckoo wasps flew off after ≤ 4 seconds. In 765 cases
(74.7%) they remained on or in the vicinity of the nest
mound for ≥ 4 seconds, the duration of these stays was 74

Are cuckoo wasps detected inside nests?
a) Experiment I
In observation cages in the laboratory, H. rutilans females
(N = 7) were observed to enter beewolf nests (N = 6 beewolf nests) and oviposit on the couched bees (N = 4).
Although in five cases the beewolf female entered the nest
while a cuckoo wasp was present and came close to (less
than 2 cm, N = 5) or even passed (N = 3) the cuckoo wasp
in the burrow, the host female did not show any signs of
detection of the brood parasitoid or disturbance. Notably,
the cuckoo wasp either ran to a distant part of the nest
when a beewolf female approached or it remained
motionless at the periphery of the nest burrow until the
female had passed.
b) Experiment II
In the recognition bioassay (Figure 1), beewolf females
always responded to the positive control (C. viridula
extract), they never responded to the negative control (solvent only), and they only rarely responded to the test discs
(H. rutilans extract). The difference in response frequency
between H. rutilans and C. viridula extracts was significant
(Fisher's exact test: P = 0.0101, Figure 1) whereas there
was no statistical difference between H. rutilans extracts
and the negative control (Fisher's exact test: P = 1, Figure

± 250 s (median = 11 s). During these stays the cuckoo
wasps moved on the nest mound, vigorously antennating
the surface. During prolonged stays at the nest, cuckoo
wasps often moved to shaded areas and sometimes even
placed themselves under some nearby structures like
leaves. In 37 of the 765 cases the entrance was open and
cuckoo wasps entered the nest for 13 – 270 s (mean: 118
± 133 s, median: 60 s). In the remaining 728 cases the
entrance was closed. Nevertheless, in 41 of these cases
cuckoo wasps tried to dig through the closure; in 29 cases
they abandoned digging after some time. In the 12
remaining cases they dug through the nest closure and
stayed in the nest for 14 to 1263 s (mean: 384 ± 421 s,
median 213 s). During the observation time we observed
89 beewolf females returning with a paralyzed honeybee
and entering their nests. In four of these cases we observed
attempts of cuckoo wasp females to attach to a honeybee
that was carried by a beewolf female while entering the
nest with its prey. In all four cases, the female detected the
parasitoid and drove it away. In another 11 cases (of the
89) cuckoo wasps were driven away by homing beewolf
females although they did not approach the prey laden
female to oviposit. In one of these cases the beewolf
female grasped the cuckoo wasp with her mandibles.
Sometimes (46 cases of 765 cases), cuckoo wasps were
driven away from a nest mound by the approach of
another cuckoo wasps. Although in one of the 89 cases the
cuckoo wasp was in the nest when the beewolf female
returned with a bee, it was not thrown out of the nest.

1). This result shows that the chemical signal consisting of
cuticular extracts of H. rutilans elicits much weaker behavioral responses in beewolf females than extracts of a
closely related chrysidid species. Thus, we hypothesized
that H. rutilans females are chemically camouflaged.
Are cuckoo wasps chemically cloaked?
The GC-MS analyses revealed alkanes, alkenes, and
mono- and dimethylalkanes as the predominant hydrocarbons in all species. We found between 12 and 34 substances on the cuticles of the five species (Table 1). H.
rutilans females shared 10 compounds with beewolf
females, 9 with beewolf males, 13 with H. nobile, 11 with
honeybees, and 14 with C. arenaria females.

The cuticles of honeybees contained a varying proportion
of saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons with a chain
lengths ranging from C25 to C33. The profile of beewolf
females is characterized by a very high proportion of
unsaturated hydrocarbons with individuals showing
either (Z)-9-C25:1 or (Z)-9-C27:1 as the main peak (for
the source and possible function of this chemical dimorphism see [29-31,34-36]). Cuckoo wasps also show relatively large amounts of the unsaturated C25:1 and C27:1.
In contrast to beewolves where individuals had only large
proportions of one of these unsaturated compounds, H.

Relative peak area (in percent, not transformed) of compounds on the cuticle of A. mellifera workers (N = 8), P. triangulum males (N = 8), P.
triangulum females (N = 7), H. rutilans females N = 13), H. nobile females (N = 4), and C. arenaria females (N = 4).

rutilans females showed fairly large proportions of both.
Furthermore, cuckoo wasps had similar proportions of
the (Z)-7- and the (Z)-9-isomers of both substances
(Table 1).

A cluster analysis based on the proportions of cuticular
hydrocarbons as revealed by GC-MS (Figure 2) clearly separated C. arenaria females from all other species in the first
bifurcation. The second bifurcation separated H. nobile

from the honeybee workers, the beewolves, and H. rutilans. The remaining individuals were subdivided by bifurcation three into the honeybees on the one side and the
beewolves and H. rutilans on the other side. Among beewolves and H. rutilans, however, the distinction was less
clear-cut. The fourth bifurcation separated a group consisting of all male beewolves and four beewolf females
(that shared (Z)-9-C25:1 as the major component) from a
group consisting of the other three beewolf females (that
shared (Z)-9-C27:1 as the major component) and H. rutilans females. Thus, the cuckoo wasps most closely resemble beewolf females exhibiting (Z)-9-C27:1 as their major
cuticular compound. Only bifurcation five separated the
H. rutilans females from the three beewolf females of that
cluster. According to this analysis, H. rutilans females are

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/5/1/2

considerably more similar to beewolf females than to
females of the closely related H. nobile, and are about as
similar to beewolf females as beewolf males.
The discriminant analysis, that followed the principal
component analysis, calculated five discriminant functions that resulted in a complete separation of the six
groups (Wilk's Λ < 0.001, d.f. = 40, P < 0.001; Figure 3,
Table 2). Discriminant function 1 represented 75.8% of
the variance and clearly separated females of both C. arenaria and H. nobile from the other groups. Discriminant
function 2 represented 10.8% of the variance and separated honeybees from a group consisting of male and
female beewolves and H. rutilans females. Discriminant
functions 3 (10.1% of the variance) and 4 (2.2% of the
variance) separated beewolf males from beewolf females.
Only discriminant function 4 and discriminant function 5
(1.1% of the variance) separated beewolf females from H.
rutilans females. Thus, although H. rutilans females can be
separated from beewolf females using GC-MS and discriminant analysis, the amount of variance that allows this
separation is very small.

Beewolf females often attacked and evicted H. rutilans
when they encountered them in front of their nest. This
seems to be the rule for interactions between hosts and
chrysidids although Linsenmaier [37] reported that there
are also cases where chrysidids do not elicit antagonistic
behavior by their hosts. Prolonged stays at hosts' nests as
observed in H. rutilans, have also been reported for other
chrysidids [22,37,38]. Staying in vicinity of the host nest
might allow the chrysidids to adjust the timing of oviposition to the most suitable stage of the provisioning cycle
or to enter the nest in the absence of the host female. That
H. rutilans females placed themselves under some cover
(e. g. leaves) during prolonged stays might, besides the
reduction of water loss, represent an attempt to hide
themselves from the host females. Other chrysidid species
also seem to hide near the entrance of a host nest and
inspect the nest or brood cell after the host female has
deposited provisions and departed for a new foraging
flight [37]. This suggests that, similar to beewolves, most
host species might recognize cuckoo wasps visually outside the nest. Since most chrysidids are brightly colored
(see e.g. drawings in [37]) this is not surprising.
However, there was no evidence that H. rutilans females
were recognized by beewolf females in their nests
although the nest owners approached the chrysidids several times. In contrast to Olberg's few reported cases [27],
we could never observe that chrysidids were thrown out of
the nest by beewolf females neither in the study population in the field, nor in observation cages in the laboratory, nor during prolonged observations of beewolf nest

aggregations as part of another study [4]. Possibly, different populations show varying local adaptations in the
defense of the parasitoid or this behavior is extremely rare.
However, we can not exclude that the chrysidids that
Olberg [27] saw were not H. rutilans. Anyhow, our observations suggest that the H. rutilans females are often not
detected in the nests. This finding is supported by the recognition bioassay. Filter paper discs treated with an extract
of H. rutilans were recognized significantly less frequently
than paper discs treated with an extract of the "alien"
cuckoo wasp C. viridula. This suggests that the properties
of the cuticular hydrocarbons of H. rutilans allow the
cuckoo wasp to avoid recognition either when encountered inside the nest or after visiting the nest for inspection
or oviposition. Our observations furthermore suggest that
in the vast majority of cases H. rutilans females enter the
nest when the female is out foraging and that they are only
rarely directly encountered by the nest owner. Thus, it
seems most important not to leave traces in the burrow
during inspection of the nest or oviposition.

females (green): Representation of the six groups for five discriminant functions a: Discriminant functions (DF) 1 and 2; b:
DF 3 and 4; c: DF 4 and 5. The analysis is based on 8 factors
revealed by the principal component analysis.

There are numerous reports of parasites of social species
that gain access to their hosts' nests and protection from
attacks mainly by chemical camouflage and more rarely
chemical mimicry [19,39-45] see also [46,47] for examples of chemical mimicry of sex pheromones in sexually
deceptive orchids). Hydrocarbons are considered to represent the principal cues for nestmate recognition in social
bees and wasps [41] and are most probably also involved
in nest identification and species recognition in solitary
species [48]. In our analysis, the GC-MS profiles of the
cuticular hydrocarbons of H. rutilans and beewolf females
show considerable similarity. At least, the null hypothesis
based on the phylogenetic relationship of a closer resemblance between the two Hedychrum species as well as the
two philanthine species was clearly contradicted. Our preliminary analysis of other species of chrysidids apart from
H. nobile showed also distinct differences to the profile of
H. rutilans (J. Kroiss, T. Schmitt, P. Schreier, E. Strohm,
unpubl. data). Furthermore, other aculeate Hymenoptera
show considerably different compositions of cuticular
compounds [49-52]. This clearly contradicts a general
similarity among all Hymenoptera or all aculeates or
between chrysidids and crabronids. The profiles of the H.
rutilans females were as close as or even closer to beewolf
females than the profiles of beewolf males. Together with
the behavioral tests, this provides strong evidence that H.
rutilans females are chemically cloaked. This will help to
reduce the probability of detection during or -more
importantly- after their presence in the nest.
A priori, chemical camouflage and mimicry seem unlikely
to evolve in a chrysidid wasp that attacks a solitary host.
Chemical camouflage, i.e. the acquisition of mimetic
compounds from a solitary host by a parasitic species,

might be problematic since, in contrast to parasites of
social hosts, there is little opportunity to sequester cloaking chemicals. Social host species possess large nests and
a large number of colony members that might serve as
sources for the relevant compounds. Brood parasites of
solitary brood caring Hymenoptera have rarely been studied in detail [53]. The only example of chemical camouflage in a brood parasite of a solitary species comes from
Nomada bees. In some species of this genus, females have
been reported to acquire mimetic odors by being perfumed by males during mating. Females of these species
seemed not to elicit aggressive responses when encountered by host females of the genus Andrena [2]. Chemical
cloaking in chrysidid wasps has not yet been reported.
With chemical camouflage being an unlikely option for a
brood parasite of solitary species, chemical cloaking
might evolve by synthesis of the compounds, i.e., chemical mimicry. For most chrysidids this is also unlikely since
they attack a large number of different host species [22]
with a varying composition of cuticular chemicals that is
not compatible with an efficient chemical cloaking. However, H. rutilans is de facto monospecific in the study area
and is, thus, predestined to evolve chemical mimicry. The
behavioral observations show that cuckoo wasps do not
regularly stay in nests for long periods. This makes a
sequestration of host chemicals that are only available in
relatively small amounts at the walls of the burrow rather
unlikely. The assumption that the cloaking compounds
are synthesized by H. rutilans females themselves is supported by details of the composition of chemicals on their
cuticle. The occurrence of considerably proportion of the
(Z)-7 isomers of the respective major components of the
beewolf cuticle ((Z)-9-C25:1 or (Z)-9-C27:1) in the brood
parasitoid but the lack thereof (at least in comparable proportions) in beewolf females contradicts an acquisition of
the chemicals from their host. Thus, most probably
cuckoo wasps produce at least some of the compounds on
their cuticle by themselves.
In addition to the qualitative imitation of the hydrocarbons of its host, the cuckoo wasps might also employ a
quantitative strategy to evade detection by beewolf
females. Preliminary data suggest that H. rutilans (as well
as several other chrysidids studied by us) have an overall
low level of cuticular substances (Kroiss, Schmitt, Strohm,
unpubl. data). Such a reduction in the amount of cuticular hydrocarbons as a means to avoid detection by the
host has been suggested by Jeral et al. [54] in thievery ants
(see also [41]). In fact, the background against which the
cuckoo wasp is perceived (or rather not perceived) by the
beewolf female is the wall of the nest burrow. This is contaminated with compounds from the cuticle of the nest
owner due to the contact with its mandibles during excavation and with the tarsi and abdomen during processing

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/5/1/2

of the excavated sand and movement inside the nest. Preliminary analyses suggest that the typical beewolf cuticular hydrocarbons can be sampled from the nest walls
(Kroiss and Strohm, unpubl. data). Thus, the chemical
traces or the presence of a cuckoo wasp whose hydrocarbon profile is sufficiently similar to the background might
not be recognized by a beewolf female.

Conclusion
H. rutilans might employ a combination of strategies to
evade detection. If encountered in the nest, they run away
or remain motionless. They possibly leave only very small
amounts of decisive and traitorous substances in the nest.
Most notably, the composition of their cuticular hydrocarbons is very similar to that of their host. Thus, H. rutilans females seem to be able to avoid detection when
directly encountered by a beewolf female in the nest.
Much more important, however, is the reduction of the
conspicuousness of scent marks left in the nest burrow or
on the bee during oviposition. This is to our knowledge
the first reported evidence for chemical mimicry (sensu
[19]) in a parasitoid of a solitary wasp.

Methods
Behavioral observations
Behavior outside the nest
We observed interactions between cuckoo wasps (H. rutilans)and beewolf females in the field in a beewolf nest
aggregation on the Campus of the University of Würzburg. Over several years there were about 100 – 500 beewolf nests (easily detectable due to the characteristic nest
mounds) and 50 – 500 H. rutilans females (determined by
capture-mark-recapture methods [55], E. Strohm, unpubl.
data). Behavioral interactions between beewolf females
and cuckoo wasps at 24 focal nests (located on an area of
about 10 × 5 m) were recorded for a total of 54 hours. We
observed whether beewolf females showed any signs of
disturbance or agonistic behavior when a cuckoo wasp
was present in the vicinity of their nests. We recorded the
following behaviors of cuckoo wasps and beewolf
females: 1. Landing of H. rutilans on nest mound. 2. Time
it stayed on nest mound (for stays > 4 sec.). 3. Whether the
nest was open or closed. 4. Whether the cuckoo wasp
entered the nest. 5. The time the cuckoo wasp stayed in the
nest and whether the nest owner was at home or not. 6.
Behavior of the cuckoo wasp during its stay outside the
nest (running, sitting hiding, no exact durations were
recorded). 7. Whether the cuckoo wasp tried to oviposit
on a bee when a female returned with prey. 8. Whether
and how a female responded to the presence of a cuckoo
wasp when returning with prey.

Given are the respective group means of the five discriminant functions (percent explained variance).

Behavior inside the nest
a) Experiment I
The interaction between host and parasite inside the nest
was investigated using observation cages in the laboratory
(for details see [20]). These cages allow observation of the
behavior of host and parasite in the main burrow. Beewolf
females (N = 6), either from the laboratory population or
from the field were kept individually in such cages and
one cuckoo wasp that was caught in the field was introduced per cage (overall 7 H. rutilans females were used).
Honey was provided ad libitum for both species. Honeybees were also provided ad libitum as prey for the beewolves. Since a pilot study revealed that the cuckoo wasps
need a humid retreat, petri-dishes with a layer of moist
sand and gravel were placed into the flight compartment
of each cage and moistened daily. Observations of interactions in the nest burrow were carried out under dimmed
red light that did not elicit any disturbance in either species. If a cuckoo wasp and a female were in a nest at the
same time, we recorded the behavior of both.
b) Experiment II
To assess the significance of the cuticular hydrocarbons
for the detection of H. rutilans beewolf female inside the
nest, we established a recognition bioassay. We recorded
the females' response towards paper discs treated with
extracts. To make sure that beewolf females responded to
the paper discs at all, we needed a positive control, i.e.,
extracts from a species that was recognized as an intruder
and elicited strong responses by beewolf females. We used
extracts of another chrysidid, Chrysis viridula (although it
might have been preferable to use extracts of H. nobile,
fresh specimens of this species were not available due to
their rarity). C. viridula is a parasitoid of eumenid wasps
and it may occur in the same habitat as H. rutilans. Its
cuticular hydrocarbons differ considerably from the composition of the cuticular hydrocarbons of H. rutilans
(Kroiss and Strohm, unpubl. data). Both cuckoo wasp
species are very similar in size and the total amount of
their cuticular hydrocarbons is alike (J Kroiss, E. Strohm,
unpublished data). Cuticular hydrocarbons of females of
H. rutilans and Chrysis viridula were extracted for 10 min in

0.5 ml distilled n-hexane (Fluka). The hexane of the cuticular extracts was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen at
ambient temperature and the extract was redissolved in
100 µl hexane. An aliquot of 10 µl of an extract was
applied onto a circular filter paper disc (diameter 6 mm.
H. rutilans: N = 7, C. viridula: N = 8) and the solvent was
allowed to evaporate for 5 min. As a negative control 10
µl of pure hexane were applied onto a filter paper disc and
evaporated (N = 7). The filter paper discs were inserted
into the main burrow of individual beewolf nests (N = 9)
in observation cages (see above) one after the other in a
randomized sequence. After introduction of the filter disc
we continuously recorded the behavior of individual beewolf females using a voice recorder until the paper disc
was evicted from the nest or until it was incorporated into
excavated material in the nest. Beewolf females biting a
paper disc or alert freezing directly at the paper disc when
approaching it at any time during a trial were considered
as evidence that a female has recognized the paper disc as
something that differed from the background odor. The
freezing behavior was distinctive and could not be
observed as a spontaneous behavior. If one or several of
these behaviors occurred the respective trials was considered as showing a response by the beewolf female. In contrast, trials during which females were walking over the
paper disc without any response were classified as "no recognition". The prediction that extracts of H. rutilans elicited weaker responses than the positive control and
similar responses as the negative control was tested by
comparing the number of trials with and without recognition. The small sample size necessitated using Fisher's
exact tests.
Chemical analyses
We caught females of H. rutilans (N = 13) in the vicinity of
beewolf nests on the campus of the University of Würzburg. Beewolf females (N = 7) and males (N = 8) were
taken from the same field site in Würzburg or from a laboratory population that was bred from the same population. Honeybee foragers (Apis mellifera carnica) (N = 8)
were caught from hives in the vicinity of the field site
when leaving the nest. Females of Hedychrum nobile

(Hymenoptera, Chrysididae) (N = 4) and its host, Cerceris
arenaria (Hymenoptera, Crabronidae, subfamily Philantinae) (N = 4) were caught at a nesting aggregation near Vizzola Ticino, Italy. These two species are another hostparasitoid pair and served as an outgroup for H. rutilans
and P. triangulum to control for phylogenetic relationships. All individuals were killed by freezing (1 h, -20°C).
Chemicals on their cuticles were extracted for 10 min in
0.5 ml distilled n-Hexane (Fluka).

the unidentified components occurs on beewolf females
and cuckoo wasps. Thus, they do not confound the similarity between these two groups that are most important
to our question. The alkenes listed in one line in Table 1
as the same compound for beewolves, cuckoo wasps and
honeybees are most probably identical since their mass
spectra and the retention times are identical. Thus, the
comparison between beewolf females and cuckoo wasps
is not confounded by the incompletely identified alkenes.

Capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS)-analysis was performed with a Fisons Instruments
(Fisons, Engelsbach, Germany) GC 8000 Series coupled
to a Fisons Instruments MD800 quadrupol mass detector.
We used a DB-5MS fused silica capillary column (30 m ×
0.25 mm i.d.; df = 0.25 µm) (J & W, Folsom, CA, USA).
The GC was programmed from 60°C for 1 min then to
310°C for 10 min with a temperature increase of 5°/min,
with 2 ml/min flow rate of helium gas. We chose a splitless injection mode (1 µl) at an injector temperature of
250°C and a splitless period of 60 sec. The mass spectrometer was operated in EI mode at 70 eV. The software
Xcalibur for Windows was used for data acquisition.

Data analysis
The results of the behavioral observations are given as the
mean ± SD and/or the median. For the recognition bioassay, we compared the number of individuals showing a
response facing the paper disc between the treatments.
Different treatments were compared using Fisher's exact
test (two-tailed) using the program BIAS for Windows version 8.2 (epsilon-Verlag GbR, H. Ackermann, Frankfurt/
Main, Germany). Since some of the females died before
their response to all stimuli could be tested, sample sizes
differ between the three stimuli.

Capillary Gas Chromatography – Fourier Transform Infrared Analysis (HRGC-FTIR). HRGC-FTIR spectra were
obtained using an HP 5890 GC (Agilent Technologies,
Böblingen, Germany) coupled to an FTS 575C Tracersystem (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA). GC separation was performed using a DB-1 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm
ID; df = 0.25 µm; J & W Scientific, Folsom, CA, USA). Temperature was programmed from 80 to 270°C with 4°C/
min heating rate. Helium was used as carrier gas with a
constant flow of 1–2 ml/min. Injection was carried out
using a split/splitless injector at 250°C in the splitless
mode for 60 sec. Injection volume was 0.1 µl. IR spectra
were recorded by scanning 256 times in a frequency range
from 4000 to 700 cm-1 with a resolution of 1 cm-1. Data
system was a Dell Optiplex GX110-PC with BioRad WinIR
Pro (Version 2.7) Tracer Software and Sadtler IRSearchMaster.
The chemical structure of the components of the cuticular
hydrocarbons was determined by comparing retention
times and diagnostic ions of the mass spectra with purchased chemicals and the use of a commercial MS database (NIST 4.0). Methylalkanes were characterized using
diagnostic ions and by determining Kovats indices according to the method of Carlson et al. (1998). The position
of double bonds was determined by DMDS derivatisation
[56]. The configuration of double bonds was revealed by
HRGC-FTIR [57,58]. Some components could not be
identified and for some alkenes the position of the double
bond and its configuration could not be determined due
to the small amounts on the cuticles. However, neither of

Patterns of chemicals on the cuticle were analyzed by multivariate methods. Since we were interested in the similarity between H. rutilans females beewolf females, beewolf
males, honeybee workers, H. rutilans females, and H.
nobile and C. arenaria females, we performed a hierarchical cluster analysis to assess the pattern of similarity without a priori grouping. Furthermore, we conducted a
discriminant analysis to test whether the groups are separated by discriminant functions. Due to the large number
of peaks relative to the sample size the discriminant analysis might lead to confounded results with regard to the
hypothesis tested. Thus, we reduced the number of variables for the discriminant analysis using principal component analysis (varimax rotation, eigenvalues > 1; 8
variables were extracted that represented 89% of the variance of the total sample).
Since relative peak areas of a sample are not statistically
independent we transformed the data according to
Aitchison ([59] see e.g. [60]). However, the original transformation procedure makes it necessary to exclude compounds that do not occur in all samples. Thus, peaks that
are zero in some samples but are present in other samples
would not have been considered. When analyzing
whether groups can be separated by their profiles such a
procedure is conservative. However, for the aim of this
study, the exclusion of peaks that are not present in all
samples would have erroneously increased the similarity
between the groups and, thus, confounded the result.
Therefore, we modified the transformation to avoid undefined values for peaks with an area of zero (log10((relative
peak area/geometric mean relative peak area)+1)). The
resulting variables were normally distributed. We used the

squared Euclidean distance as a measure of distance for
cluster analysis and between groups average linkage as the
method for combining clusters. Analyses were calculated
using SPSS 13.0.1.
