Abstract
Background: Phylogenies are commonly used to analyse the differences between genes, genomes
and species. Patristic distances calculated from tree branch lengths describe the amount of genetic
change represented by a tree and are commonly compared with other measures of mutation to
investigate the substitutional processes or the goodness of fit of a tree to the raw data. Up until
now no universal tool has been available for calculating patristic distances and correlating them with
other genetic distance measures.
Results: PATRISTICv1.0 is a java program that calculates patristic distances from large trees in a
range of file formats and allows graphical and statistical interpretation of distance matrices
calculated by other programs.
Conclusion: The software overcomes some logistic barriers to analysing signals in sequences. In
additional to calculating patristic distances, it provides plots for any combination of matrices,
calculates commonly used statistics, allows data such as isolation dates to be entered and reorders
matrices with matching species or gene labels. It will be used to analyse rates of mutation and
substitutional saturation and the evolution of viruses. It is available at http://biojanus.anu.edu.au/
programs/ and requires the Java runtime environment.

Background
Phylogenetic trees are standardly used to analyse gene
families as well as species ancestry [1]. A patristic distance
is the sum of the lengths of the branches that link two
nodes in a tree, where those nodes are typically terminal
nodes that represent extant gene sequences or species. A
matrix of patristic distances calculated from a tree for all
pairs of genes or species summarizes the genetic change,
or phylogenetic change, represented in the tree and the
data. The distances may be used to analyse the rate of
change and may be compared with other measures of
genetic difference, such as the total change (evolutionary
distance) or components of change such as those indi-

cated by transitions, transversions, gene rearrangements
or recombination [2-4]. In one significant example, the
origin of the HIV pandemic was investigated by comparing the patristic distances of dated HIV gene sequences [5].
There are many methods and programs for finding, building, or testing trees but only one is known to us that calculates patristic distances and it does so only from
maximum parsimony trees, which by definition only represent a fraction of genetic change [6].

Implementation
PATRISTICv1.0 is a Java program that can be used as an
applet on our website or downloaded. It calculates patrisPage 1 of 5

samples, may be entered for each species or gene as real
numbers. If sample times are entered directly
PATRISTICv1.0 will generate a matrix of time differences
between the species or sequences.
The order of sequences or species represented in a tree
almost always differs from the order in the original data
file from which the tree was found. Hence to plot patristic
distances against distances calculated by other methods or
patristic distances from two trees, the program automatically reorders matrices with matching sequence or species
labels. Matrices may also be edited and reordered within
an editing window.

tic distances from trees, generates scatter plots from
ordered pairs of distances and calculates correlation coefficients and other statistics from distance matrices. It reads
trees in variants of the Newick format, including the
NEXUS variant used by the package PAUP [6] and the variants used by the programs MEGA [6], PHYLIP [8], CLUSTALX [9] and TREEPUZZLE [10]. An algorithm that
traverses the various textual representations of trees [11]
was used to calculate the patristic distances, along with
code that permitted different tree-text formats to be read,
permitted the easy selection of matrices for plotting from
a large number of stored matrices and permitted matrices
and plots to be displayed. PATRISTICv1.0 runs on Windows, Mac and Linux systems with the Java Runtime Environment. A patristic distance matrix from a tree of 187
gene sequences was calculated in 12 seconds in a PC with
an AMD CPU at 2.2 GHz and 256 RAM using the JRE 1.5.
PATRISTICv1.0 was tested by calculating patristic distances by hand across several small trees and in every case
the results of the program were found to be accurate.
The program also recognises distance matrices calculated
by other programs from other components of sequence
data, such as evolutionary distances calculated from pairwise sequence comparisons. It reads distance matrices
generated by the programs MEGA, PAUP and PHYLIP. For
the current version, these externally generated matrices
must be presented as upper-right or lower-left hemimatrices or a column. Other measures of that can be converted into distances, such as the isolation dates of virus

A regression is calculated from the ordered pairs of distances when two matrices are plotted against each other
(Figure 1) and simple statistics such as the sums of the distances are displayed. Correlation coefficients, differences
and quotients between the ordered pairs of distances may
also be calculated using PATRISTICv1.0, as may the mean
and standard deviation of the differences or quotients,
and the program has a facility to enter other formulae so
that other statistics can be calculated.
Points on a plot that lie outside a chosen multiple of the
standard deviation are identified by colour. Points are
also automatically identified on a plot when the mouse
cursor is moved over them. A zoom feature allows the user
to focus on a specific part of a plot by choosing the minimum and maximum distances for the two axes which correspond to the two distance matrices. Plots of distance
matrices may be inverted relative to the axes by a single
mouse click. The user can also determine the scale used on
the axes as well as the dot size.
Plots may be saved as postscript or jpeg files allowing editing in graphics software in a vectorial or bitmap format.
The program also allows distance matrices to be saved in
a coma separated value format (CSV) as a full matrix or as
columns so that they may be entered into a spreadsheet
program. Matrices can also be saved in the DIP format
used by the software DIPLOMO [12].

Results and Discussion
Maximum likelihood (ML) methods provide the best estimates of evolutionary change and genetic difference by
modelling substitutions. Models are used to calculate
branch-lengths (genetic change) that take into account the
superimposition of substitutions and the similarities
between one sequence or taxon and all others represented
in the dataset [13]. Hence, some patristic distances from
ML trees are greater than the equivalent estimates of
genetic distance, when the genetic distances are based on
pair-wise comparisons between the raw sequences. The
converse also occurs if patristic distances are calculated

from a maximum parsimony tree, since characters that do
not conform to the cladistic definition of phylogenetic
information (autapomorphies and homoplasies) are discounted. To demonstrate one of those effects we used
PATRISTICv1.0 to plot patristic distances against uncor-

rected evolutionary distances, where the patristic distances were calculated from an ML tree of bunyavirus RNA
polymerase gene sequences and the evolutionary distances were obtained from pair-wise comparisons of the
same sequences without reference to a tree (Figure 2A). It

can be seen that whereas the evolutionary (raw) distances
increased linearly the patristic distances were greater and
increased exponentially.
Another use of patristic distances is to investigate recombinational processes. A low correlation between distances
obtained from different genes may indicate a recombinational process such as horizontal gene transfer [14]. Influenza A viruses undergo a recombinational process, known
as reassortment, that produces incongruities much like
those produced by horizontal gene transfer, but on a
smaller scale [15], and the incongruities may be identified
as poorly correlated patristic distances. We detected
incongruities probably due to reassortment by plotting
patristic distances calculated from the neuraminidase
(NA) and RNA cap-binding protein (PB2) genes of a set of
influenza A virus N1 subtype isolates (Figure 2B); we
found that the majority of the points lie close to the
regression line and appear to increase linearly, whereas
some points fall well off the line. Even when there has
been no recombination, different measures of genetic difference from the same set of organisms may not correlate
linearly. The rates of change in nucleotide sequences and
the amino acid sequences they encode do not vary linearly
because of the redundancy in the genetic code and
because some sites reach a saturation point of superimposed substitutions. We demonstrated the effect by plotting patristic distances calculated from the nucleocapsid
protein amino acid sequences and the equivalent nucleotide sequences of bunyaviruses (Figure 2C); the patristic
distances from the nucleotide sequence tree increased at a
greater rate than the equivalent patristic distances from
the amino acid tree.

analysed. PATRISTICv1.0 was developed to permit expedient comparisons and analyses. The program reads trees
and distance matrices produced by the most commonly
used software without editing. Re-formatting is a time
consuming element of multiple sequence and phylogenetic analysis and for that reason PATRISTICv1.0 creates
no new intermediate formats. The need to re-order distance data from gene sequences or species was a major
barrier that previously hindered analyses and that problem has been solved. The program is likely to be used to
analyse recombination, rates of mutation and substitutional saturation and the evolution of rapidly evolving
entities such as viruses.

Conclusion
A phylogenetic tree usually represents signals drawn from
many sites in the sequences from which it was inferred,
and it represents a hierarchy of those signals that may be
nested. Hence, the relationships between phylogenetic
trees and sequences of interest are often complex and
obscure. Comparisons of patristic distances and other
measures of genetic change allow the relationships to be

Patristic distances have broader uses as it is sometimes of
value to compare them with other data, such as data
related to time or geographic distribution. For example,
comparisons of the times of isolation and the distances
between the sequences of influenza A virus strains
describe an important process whereby the older strains
are being eliminated from global circulation and being
replaced by new strains. Figure 2D shows that the patristic
distances from an ML tree of the neuraminidase genes of
a set of influenza virus isolates correlated with the differences in years between the times of isolation of the isolates.
