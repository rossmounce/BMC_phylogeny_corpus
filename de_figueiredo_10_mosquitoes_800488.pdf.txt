Abstract
Dengue epidemics have been reported in Brazil since 1985. The scenery has worsened in the last decade because
several serotypes are circulating and producing a hyper-endemic situation, with an increase of DHF/DSS cases as well
as the number of fatalities. Herein, we report dengue virus surveillance in mosquitoes using a Flavivirus genus-specific
RT-Hemi-Nested-PCR assay. The mosquitoes (Culicidae, n = 1700) collected in the Northeast, Southeast and South of
Brazil, between 1999 and 2005, were grouped into 154 pools. Putative genomes of DENV-1, -2 and -3 were detected in
6 mosquito pools (3.8%). One amplicon of putative DENV-1 was detected in a pool of Haemagogus leucocelaenus
suggesting that this virus could be involved in a sylvatic cycle. DENV-3 was found infecting 3 pools of larvae of Aedes
albopictus and the nucleotide sequence of one of these viruses was identified as DENV-3 of genotype III,
phylogenetically related to other DENV-3 isolated in Brazil. This is the first report of a nucleotide sequence of DENV-3
from larvae of Aedes albopictus.
Findings
Dengue viruses (family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus),
serotypes 1 to 4 (DENV-1, -2, -3 and -4), are responsible
for large urban outbreaks. Infection with any of the four
dengue virus serotypes can lead to acute febrile illness
and to the severe, sometimes fatal, dengue hemorrhagic
fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS) [1].
DENV are transmitted to humans mainly by Aedes
aegypti mosquitoes, which acquired the infection
through blood-feeding on infected individuals or by
transovarial transmission [2]. Besides, in Africa and Asia,
DENV have been reported in sylvatic (enzootic) cycle
involving non-human primates and various species of
Aedes mosquito (such as Ae. furcifer, Ae. luteocephalus
and Ae. taylori) [3].
The first viral isolation in Brazil was reported in 1981 in
Roraima Sate, Northern Brazil, where DENV-1 and
DENV-4 were isolated and associated with dengue cases.
DENV-1 and DENV-2 were introduced in Rio de Janeiro,
in 1985 and 1990, respectively; then, both viruses co-circulate for 10 years causing several outbreaks in the country, including many cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever. In
2000, DENV-3 was introduced in Rio de Janeiro State and
then spread to all the country, co-circulating with DENV* Correspondence: ltmfigue@fmrp.usp.br

1 and DENV-2. Finally, DENV-4 was isolated from dengue fever cases in Manaus at Amazon State, in 2005, suggesting its circulation in that City [4,5]. Actually, Brazil is
facing a hyper-endemic situation with increase number of
DHF/DSS in children and fatal cases [6,7].
Herein, we report results of dengue virus surveillance
in mosquitoes using a RT-Hemi-Nested-PCR assay.
Using light traps in the soil and the top of the trees,
1700 mosquitoes (Culicidae, Diptera) were captured in
three different places of Brazil (Table 1), where dengue
outbreaks have been reported [8]. Thus, in Coribe
County (13° 49' 44" S, 44° 27' 14" O), Bahia State, Northeast region, 644 mosquitoes were collected in the rain
forest, in 2002. In the City of Foz do Iguaçu (25° 32' 52" S,
54° 25' 16" O), Parana State, South region, 370 mosquitoes were collected at urban area, in 2005. In the City of
Santos (23° 56' 13.16" S, 46° 30' 34" O), São Paulo State,
Southeast region, 686 mosquitoes were collected in the
urban area, in 1999. In addition, larvae were collected
from domestic and peridomestic containers.
Mosquitoes and larvae were identified in CO2 atmosphere, based on morphologic characteristics [9] and
those from the same specie or genus, captured in the
same place, were pooled (~10 adult or larvae mosquitoes/
pool) based on day of collection and stored at - 70°C
(Table 1). To each mosquito pool, 1.5 ml of 4% bovine
albumin in PBS (pH 7.8) were added. The specimens were

crushed using grind and mortar, and centrifuged at 2500
× g, for 30 minutes, at 4°C. The supernatants were split in
two aliquots and stored at - 80°C until use [10].
RNA from the supernatant of macerated mosquito
samples was extracted using the Qiamp Viral RNA Kit
(QIAGEN, USA). RNA extracts were subjected to a Flavivirus genus-specific RT-Hemi-Nested-PCR that allows
the identification of DENV-1 to 4, YFV, ILH, SLEV, BSQV
and ROCV [11]. The size of the amplification products
suggests the presence of DENV genomes in 6 (3.8%)
pools (Figure 1), and the information on theses mosquitoes is summarized in Table 2. Amplicons having DENV1 compatible size were obtained from a pool of Haemagogus leucocelaenus captured in Coribe County and from
adult females of Aedes aegypti capture in Santos City [11].
One amplicon with DENV-2 compatible size was amplified from a pool of Aedes aegypti captured in Foz do Iguaçu City [11]. Finally, DENV-3 compatible amplicon was
obtained from 3 pools of larvae of Aedes aegypti collected
in Santos [11].
The amplicon of DENV-3 obtained from the pool of
larvae of Aedes albopictus was directly sequenced after

purification from the agarose gel with the QUIAquick gel
extraction (Qiagen, USA). The purified product was
sequenced in an ABI PRISM®3100 Genetic Analyzer
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA-USA). The
obtained 568 base pair sequence, named D3/BR/Santos/
A. albopictus 13/1999, was registered in the GenBank
with the accession number HM053487. This sequence
was aligned with 569 worldwide DENV-3 retrieved from
GenBank using the program CLUSTAL W software [12].
The alignment was edited with the software MEGA 4.0
[13]. The phylogenetic relationship among strains was
reconstructed by the neighbor-joining (NJ) using MEGA
4.0. The analyses were supported by bootstrap using 1000
replicates. Figure 2 shows the phylogenetic tree with the
characteristic distribution of DENV-3 in four genotypes,
as previously reported [14,15]. The sequence obtained in
this study grouped in the genotype III together with Brazilian strains. The other amplicons could no be
sequenced because of the small quantity of the products.
All procedures were performed in order to avoid any
type of contamination; different rooms were used for

RNA purification, NS5 protein gene amplification and
PCR products analysis.
The RT-Hemi-Nested-PCR method used in this study
has been shown previously to be a reliable diagnostic tool
to detect flavivirus infection in humans [16]. We were
able to obtain amplicons of putative DENV-1, DENV-2
and DENV-3, and one of the amplicons was confirmed to
be DENV-3 by nucleotide sequencing.
A putative DENV-1 was detected infecting females of
Aedes aegypti captured in Santos in 1999, at the same
time of an outbreak with 4685 reported cases [17].
In addition, a putative DENV-2 was also found infecting the same specie of mosquito captured in Foz do Iguaçu and a putative DENV-1 was detected infecting the
same mosquito species from Santos. Aedes aegypti, an
anthropofilic and urban mosquito, is the most important
dengue vector in the Americas and is present in practically all Brazilian cities [18].
Interestedly, we have found putative DENV-1 infecting
females of Haemagogus leucocelaenus collected in a rain
forest of the Northeast of Brazil. This finding might suggest a sylvatic cycle of the virus as previously reported in
Africa with DENV-2 and in Asia with DENV-1, -2 and -4,
involving non-human primates [3,19]. This may also represent the beginning of sylvatic adaptation of a virus circulating in the urban area. A similar phenomenon has
previously occurred with the African YFV, which lead to
urban epidemics after its introduction in the Americas,
but then, suffered a processes of adaptation to a sylvatic
cycle in Haemagogus janthynomis, leucocelaenus and
Sabethes spp., and non-human primates [20]. Equally, the
sylvatic DENV in Asia is maintained in an enzootic cycle,
mainly circulating in canopy-dwelling monkeys, with

infrequent spillover to human populations via Aedes spp.
that feed on both upper and lower canopy primates [21].
Besides, the four serotypes of DENV have been recently
reported in French Guyana infecting rodents, marsupials,
chiroptera, and showing that sylvatic cycles are occurring
in South America [22]. It is known that sylvatic strains of
DENV are genetically distinct of the endemic viruses
[21]. However, it was not possible to obtain the nucleotide sequence of the amplicon of the putative DENV-1
infecting Haemagogus leucocelaenus. Further studies are
necessary in order to confirm that DENV-1 is infecting
Haemagogus in Brasil.
Putative DENV-3 was found infecting 3 pools of Aedes
albopictus larvae collected in 1999, in Santos City, at the
coast of São Paulo, the most populated state of Brazil.
The sequence of one of these viruses was identified as
DENV-3 of genotype III, phylogenetically related to Brazilian isolates. As far as we know, this is the first nucleotide sequence of DENV-3 ever reported from larvae of
Aedes albopictus. DENV-3 of genotype III was firstly
reported in Brazil in 2000 in Rio de Janeiro [23]. However,
based on our data, we can suppose that DENV-3 genotype III was introduced in the Brazilian Southeast coast
before 2000. It was also recognized another introduction
of DENV-3 genotype III at the North of the country [8].
This finding also suggests that Aedes albopictus could
have participated as vector in the huge dengue outbreaks
occurred in the Brazilian coast. Furthermore, the infection of larvae of Aedes albopictus is an evidence of transovarial transmission of DENV-3, as previously reported
with DENV-1 [24]. Aedes albopictus is a mosquito from
Asia that was introduced in Brazil by merchant ships.
This mosquito is not as antropophilic as Aedes aegypti
and can be found in both urban and rural areas [25]. The
vertical transmission of DENV ensures presence of the
pathogen in mosquitoes independent of their feeding
upon an infective human blood carrying DENV. This
virus retention across mosquito generations may serve to
keep DENV in nature during inter-epidemic periods of
the disease being a possible cause of reemergence of dengue in areas previously exposed to the virus. It also may
have importance for amplifying an ongoing disease outbreak [26,27].
Laboratory-based mosquito surveillance is important
to provide an early warning of dengue fever epidemics, to
furnish information on who are the vectors carrying
DENV in nature and what is happening in terms of virus
transmission during these outbreaks. This knowledge is
crucial for vector control measures since we still do not
have a dengue vaccine. The RT-nested-PCR used in the
present study allowed a fast detection and typing of
DENV and other flavivirus in the mosquitoes.
