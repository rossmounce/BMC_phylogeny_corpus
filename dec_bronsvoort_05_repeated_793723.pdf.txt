Abstract
Background: Ivermectin (Mectizan™, Merck and CO. Inc.) is being widely used in the control of human onchocerciasis
(Onchoverca volvulus) because of its potent effect on microfilariae. Human studies have suggested that, at the standard
dose of 150 µg/kg an annual treatment schedule of ivermectin reversibly interferes with female worm fertility but is not
macrofilaricidal. Because of the importance of determining whether ivermectin could be macrofilaricidal, the efficacy of
high and prolonged doses of ivermectin and a related avermectin, doramectin, were investigated in cattle infected with
O. ochengi.
Methods: Drugs with potential macrofilaricidal activity, were screened for the treatment of human onchocerciasis, using
natural infections of O. ochengi in African cattle. Three groups of 3 cows were either treated at monthly intervals (7
treatments) with ivermectin (Ivomec®, Merck and Co. Inc.) at 500 µg/kg or doramectin (Dectamax®, Pfizer) at 500 µg/
kg or not treated as controls. Intradermal nodules were removed at 6 monthly intervals and adult worms were examined
for signs of drug activity.
Results: There was no significant decline in nodule diameter, the motility of male and female worms, nor in male and
female viability as determined by the ability to reduce tetrazolium, compared with controls, at any time up to 24 months
from the start of treatments (mpt). Embryogenesis, however, was abrogated by treatment, which was seen as an
accumulation of dead and dying intra-uterine microfilariae (mf) persisting for up to 18 mpt. Skin mf densities in treated
animals had fallen to zero by <3 mpt, but by 18 mpt small numbers of mf were found in the skin of some treated animals
and a few female worms were starting to produce multi-cellular embryonic stages. Follow-up of the doramectin treated
group at 36 mpt showed that mf densities had still only regained a small proportion of their pre-treatment levels.
Conclusion: These results have important implications for onchocerciasis control in the field. They suggest that
ivermectin given at repeated high does may sterilise O. volvulus female worms for prolonged periods but is unlikely to kill
them. This supports the view that control programmes may need to continue treatments with ivermectin for a period
of decades and highlights the need to urgently identify new marcofiliaricidal compounds.

Background
An estimated 17.5 million people in Africa and a further
140,000 in the Americas are infected by the filarial parasite Onchocerca volvulus, the cause of human river blindness [1]. The disease and its vector, Simulium damnosum
s.l., have been the target of the largest successful and sustained vector-control programme the world has known,
the Onchocerciasis Control Programme in West Africa
(OCP) [2]. However in 1987 the veterinary endectocide,
ivermectin, was registered as a safe and effective microfilaricide for human use against O. volvulus as an oral preparation, Mectizan™. The manufacturers, Merck and Co.
Inc., via their Mectizan™ Donation Programme are committed to provide ivermectin free of charge to the port of
entry of endemic countries 'for as long as is necessary' to
aid the control of onchocerciasis. The African Programme
for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC) [3] utilises ivermectin
as its main tool to eliminate onchocerciasis as a public
health problem. It aims to distribute ivermectin once a
year through a sustainable, community-directed distribution system (CDTS).
The macrocyclic lactones are effective against a wide range
of ecto- and endoparasites of animals and man. They are
grouped into two major chemical families: the avermectins (including ivermectin and doramectin) and the
milbemycins (including moxidectin). Ivermectin is
derived from the actinomycete, Streptomyces avermitilis,
and was originally developed as a veterinary endectocide
against endo- and ectoparasites. Doramectin is a fermentation product from a mutant S. avermectilis strain. Its
spectrum of activity is nearly the same as ivermectin [4]
but its lipophilic cyclohexyl moiety at the 25-position
produces a longer tissue half-life of 89 hours [5].
The efficacy of ivermectin against the skin dwelling larval
stage of O. volvulus which causes blindness and skin
lesions is well established [6-8]. However, its action
against adult male and female worms is the subject of
debate. Human studies with O. volvulus using a single
dose at 150 µg/kg [9] produced no increased mortality of
the adult worms and reversible affects on their fertility.
Repeated 6-monthly [10-13] or 3-monthly treatments
[14] produced conflicting results, but a proportion of
female worms recovered their fertility 12–18 months after
the last treatment and mf loads were 6–7% of pre-treatment loads 12 months after the last treatment, rising to
between 9–32% at 18 months [15]. Epidemiological analysis and mathematical simulations of annual ivermectin
treatments in man suggest that there is approximately a
30% reduction in mf production [16]. These authors,
however, were not able to differentiate between the possible biological mechanisms such as a general loss of fecundity, or death of a proportion of the adult worms, or
ivermectin facilitated immunity.

http://www.filariajournal.com/content/4/1/8

In this paper, we describe a controlled therapeutic trial in
which the effects of high, repeated doses of ivermectin or
doramectin were investigated against the African cattle
parasite O. ochengi for up to 36 months after the first treatment. This species is phylogenetically closely related to O.
volvulus for which it provides an excellent analogue [17]
and was formerly adopted by the World Health Organisation (WHO) tertiary drug screening system for macrofilaricides until 2000. Previous studies have indicated both its
practical merits and its predictive value [18-20].

Materials and methods
Between February and March 1994, nine 4–6 year old
Gudali cows (Bos indicus), each with more than 20 palpable O. ochengi nodules in the ventral abdominal skin, were
purchased from local markets in the Adamoua province of
Cameroon. They were kept at pasture on the research station of the Institut de Récherches Agricole pour le Développement (IRAD) (formerly the Institit de Récherches
Zootechniques et Vétérinaires), Wakwa, 10 km S.W. of
Ngaoundere, at an altitude of 1000 m where the annual
transmission potential (ATP, measured in L3s/person/
year) for O. ochengi is low, around 600 L3's (Renz and
Bronsvoort unpublished observations). Treatments began
in October 1994, and nodulectomies and 3-monthly skin
biopsies were continued for 24 mpt. In July of 1997 (36
mpt) the experiment was terminated.
Treatment regime
The cows were cast in lateral recumbency and the nodule
distribution on each side of the ventral abdomen was
mapped on a standardised recording sheet to allow tracking of individual nodules. The cows (mean weight = 379
kg) were ranked in order of their number of nodules and
assigned to one of 3 groups, giving an even distribution of
nodules between groups (Table 2). The cows were treated
with either a subcutaneous inject of 500 µg/kg ivermectin,
or a subcutaneous inject of 500 µg/kg doramectin or not
treated to act as controls. Treatments were repeated at
monthly intervals for 7 treatments.
Sampling regime
At 3-monthly intervals 3 superficial skin biopsies
(between 10–20 mg) per animal were taken from a shaved
patch of skin on the ventral mid-line between the umbilicus and the udder. They were incubated in Roswell Park
Institute Medium (RPMI) for 24 hours followed by collagenase at 37°C for 24 hours, using the protocol of Renz et
al. [18]. The majority of mf escaped from the skin in the
first 24 hours of incubation with the remaining mf found
after digestion of the skin with collagenase. The geometric
mean number of mf per 100 mg of skin from the three
biopsies for each animal using the log+1 transformation.
The mean per group was calculated in a similar way. All
animals were sampled on the same morning.

O. ochengi nodules numbers were assessed by careful palpation of the skin of each cow. The distribution of nodules was recorded prior to treatment and about 20
nodules per cow were permanently marked with three
dots around the nodule using green tattooing ink. This
ensured identification of sites where nodules had been
should they disappear completely following treatment.
Nodule numbers were re-counted at 6 monthly intervals
until 24 mpt (8/9 animals). After recording nodule distribution, four nodules per animal were removed under
local anaesthetic and the wounds closed with a catgut
suture and treated with Negasunt® (Bayer plc) powder to
control fly strike. Two nodules per cow were preserved in
10% formal saline for histological examination. The
remaining 2 nodules per cow were examined the same day
by the triple assay described by Renz et al. [18], with the
following slight modifications.
Triple assay of live female and male worms
In brief, the nodules were trimmed of any host tissue and
measured along their longest axis to give the 'nodule
diameter'. Each nodule was then cut open on a hollow
slide in phosphate buffered saline and the worm contents
carefully expressed. The male worms were teased free and
placed individually in the wells of a 24 well plate with
RPMI. The anterior 5–10 mm of each female worm was
amputated and placed in a separate well and classed as
either 1, young (transparent white, little incrustations on
the cuticle); 2, mature (yellow-brownish, with incrustations); 3, old (dark brownish, strong incrustations); or 4,
calcified (black and calcified).

After incubation (30 minutes at 37°C), the motility of
male worms and anterior ends of female worms were
scored after 30 seconds of observation on a 3 point scale
(0 = no movement; 1 = weak, slow or intermittent movement; 2 = vigorous movement). Individual worm viability

was then assessed by the MTT/formazan assay [18,21].
The optical density of the formazan reduction product
was determined at 492 nm (OD492, 'Cambridge Life
Instruments photo-spectrometer'). Mean OD492 readings
for the total male worm or anterior ends of female worms
were used until 18 mpt after which the mean OD492 / 10
mm of worm was calculated.
The remaining (posterior) part of each female worm was
then washed into a mortar with 1.8 ml of PBS (final volume 2 ml), gently crushed with a pestle and a sample
transferred to a Fuchs-Rosenthal chamber (3.2 µl) to
determine an embryogram following the method of
Schulz-Key [22]. A count was made of the normal and
abnormal/pathologic embryonic stages and intra-uterine
mf. Oocytes were also counted, but the repeatability of
their counts was not reliable and they were not included
in the final analysis.
Statistical Analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using 'Minitab'1 and
BMDP2 computer packages. The nodule counts, nodule
diameters and the MTT reduction/formazan formation
results were analysed using a two-way repeat measures
ANOVA between groups and timepoints. Worm age,
motility scores and the percentage pathological stages at
each timepoint were compared using a Kruskal-Wallis
non-parametric one-way ANOVA. All statistical tests were
interpreted at the 5% level of significance.

Results
Of the original nine cows at the start of the study, one control animal, no. 17, had to be slaughtered after the 12 mpt
sampling on welfare grounds. Two more animals, one
control and one ivermectin treated animal, were removed
for different reasons after the 24 mpt sampling and regular
observations were terminated at this point. However,

Control

a: Slaughtered following tetracycline therapy for dermatophilus infection, b: slaughtered due to septic arthritis, c lost to follow-up

where possible skin mf loads were monitored and nodules collected from the remaining six animals until 51
mpt.
Microfilariae
Following treatment, the mf density in the skin declined
sharply and no skin mf were found at 3 mpt (Table 1). The
control animals maintained substantial mf loads throughout the study, although their loads fluctuated considerably. Small numbers of mf began reappearing in 4/6 of the
treated animals between 15 and 21 mpt.
Nodule counts, diameter and female age score
Table 2 gives the mean nodule counts, the mean nodule
diameter and the median female age score (male age
scores were not included) for the 3 groups before and 24
months after the start of treatment. There was no significant difference in nodule counts or nodule diameters
between the groups or time points.
Motility, number of males and females per nodule and
viability as measured by formazan formation
Male Onchocerca worms are mobile and although the
number per female varied during the experiment, the ratio
of males to females remained around one (with one
female worm to each nodule). The male and female
median motility scores are summarised in Table 3 and Figure 1. The median motility of male worms remained at 2
throughout the study except at 18 mpt for the ivermectin
group. Similarly, for female anterior ends, their motility
was 2 except at 24 mpt when this dropped. A Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA comparing the group medians for this timepoint was not significant (p = 0.20).

From Figures 1a and 1b there is clearly no drug effect on
worm viability/OD492 of either males or females. There is
an effect of time with mean OD492 readings dropping after
18 mpt. This effect is associated with the change to a
standardisation of the viability/OD492 per 10 mm of
worm length.

Embryograms
The results of the embryograms are given in Figure 2. Normal embryonic stages (small morulae, large morulae,
horseshoes, pretzels or coiled microfilariae) disappeared
from the two treated groups by 6 mpt and failed to reappear in the female worms. Intrauterine mf accumulated
and finally degenerated in the uteri, failing to be expelled
for more than 24 months from the start of treatment.
Beginning with approximately 10,000 normal intra-uterine mf stages pre-treatment, the number of pathological
stages peaked around 30–40,000 at 6 to 12 mpt. The intrauterine mf disintegrated steadily, first becoming vacuolated and non-motile, and eventually becoming ghost
forms. This sterilizing effect persisted in 4 of the 6 treated
animals for up to 24 months from the start of treatment.
In two of the doramectin treated animals a nodule (i.e. 2/
6 nodules), classed as old, was recovered at both the 18
and 24 mpt examinations, with large numbers of normal
embryonic and intra-uterine mf amongst the pathological
stages still in the uteri. In the ivermectin-treated animals,
no fertile nodules were found, but the small number of mf
in the skin in one animal (no. 14) indicates the presence
of at least one fertile worm couple.

Discussion
Previous drug trials [18,23] have demonstrated the advantages of the O. ochengi screen in cattle in which individual

As in previous studies in cattle [18], the skin mf density
declined to zero following treatment with ivermectin and
the same result was found with doramectin. Although mf
began reappearing around 18 mpt only one animal, no.
12, showed a consistent increase in mf density and therefore the presence of at least one fertile worm couple. An
interesting observation was the disappearance of mf from
the skin of a control animal, no. 17. This was associated
with repeated treatments of oxytetracyclines for a severe
mycotic drematitis (Dermatophilus congolensis) skin infection. Treatment failed to control the skin infection and the
animal was culled on welfare grounds after the 12-mpt
sampling. The macrofilaricidal effect of oxytetracyclines
was subsequently demonstrated [23].
In spite of being given at 2.5 times the recommended dose
for cattle and at monthly intervals for 7 treatments, neither ivermectin nor doramectin reduced nodule diameter,
male or female worm number or male motility compared
with controls. Female motility appeared to be compromised in the doramectin treated group by 24 mpt, though
this was not statistically significant. The viability/OD492 of
female worms, however, did not appear to have been
reduced significantly. Taken together these results support
the conclusions of previous studies in humans taking
invermectin once or twice annually that even using high
and prolonged dosing, the avermectins are not macrofilaricidal against Onchocerca spp. [10,12,13]. The failure to
kill the adult worm is, however, not due to a failure of the
drug to penetrate the O. ochengi intra-dermal nodule
[24,25].

The main effect of both ivermectin and doramectin on the
adult female worm was on the development of the multicellular embryonic stages and the intra-uterine mf, as in
man [10,12,13] where repeated treatments of ivermectin
at 150 µg/kg every 6–12 months were reversible after 9–
18 months though fecundity had been reduced. Interestingly, the number of intra-uterine mf rose sharply in both
treated groups as dead and dying mf accumulated in the
uteri of the worms. Over the same period the embryonic
stages disappeared from the uteri. Certainly some of these

in man [11,12] as we found male numbers to vary over
time with no clear decline. Further, the male worms maintained their motility and viability (OD492) throughout the
24 months of the study. The effects of avermectins on
male fertility were not examined here.
Our study has demonstrated that with higher doses of
ivermectin or doramectin, repeated at monthly intervals,
embryogenesis can be disrupted and possibly permanently impaired. Even 18 months after the last treatment
none of the removed ivermectin treated nodules showed
signs of recommencing embryogenesis. At 24 mpt, 2/6
nodules in the doramectin group did appear to regain
some reproductive capability.

must have continued to develop through to mf in order to
explain these changes [26]. Why the degradation and disappearance of dead mf from the uteri is so protracted, is
unclear, but it may be important in preventing fertilisation of the female [11,27], as this is the stimulation for a
new cycle of oogenesis [28]. Alternatively, the uteri may
be paralysed as happens to the pharyneal muscles of
Haemonchus contortus [29].
Observations in man noted a disappearance of O. volvulus
males from nodules following multiple treatments with
ivermectin [14,30]. In addition, after treatment with other
macrofilaricidal drugs, fewer males were recovered from
O. ochengi nodules [18] and this is considered a useful,
early indicator of macrofilaricidal activity. Our study,
however, is in agreement with observations on O. volvulus

In previous studies of age-specific nodule counts [31] it
has been suggested that nodules continue to be acquired
throughout the life of the cow while their mf loads level
off around 4–6 years of age. From the prophylactic studies
in cattle [19,32] it is clear that ivermectin and moxidectin
can prevent the development of L3 larvae in the host for
at least 3 months after a single treatment. The corrals at
Wakwa have a known low ATP of around 600 L3's per animal per year as opposed to 24,000 L3's per year near the
Simulium breeding sites (Renz and Bronsvoort unpublished observations). In our study although there was a
low level of transmission in the area, the nodule burden
of the animals did not alter significantly up until 24 mpt
after allowing for the removal of 20 nodules per animal.
An alternative hypothesis could be that there is some form
of density-dependent regulation of the adult worms with
only very low turnover of the adult population. This theory is supported by the observation that control animals
in the current experiment failed to acquire new nodules in
the first year as determined by the regular 6 monthly
counts. In addition different trials where L3's were experimentally inoculated into calves have failed to produce a
clear positive correlation between the number of infective
larvae inoculated and the number of nodules that subsequently developed [33,34]. If in fact there is some form of
density dependent regulation of the adult population
with individual worm burdens determined by some hostparasite balance then it may actually be more beneficial to
sterilise the female worm, thus preventing the majority of
new infections from developing.
The sterilising effect of high doses of ivermectin, combined with their prophylactic potential [19], will ensure
the usefulness of this drug and/or related compounds.
With community-directed distributions being set up
under the APOC scheme there will be a much improved
potential for timing treatments and/or increasing the frequency of treatments to maximise these other useful
effects. High doses and increased frequency of treatment
has been shown here to reduce female worm fertility in O.

ochengi and similar results have been demonstrated in
humans for O. volvulus [35]. This potentially could help to
reduce the length of control programmes though it is
doubtful whether high coverage levels could be sustained
long enough to achieve worldwide eradication [36]. In
addition, work on O. ochengi suggests that people receiving ivermectin are unlikely to develop immunity to O. volvulus and are therefore highly susceptible should drug
distribution cease [32]. However, WHO itself recognises
that ivermectin by itself can not completely interrupt
transmission of O. volvulus [37-39] and therefore work
should continue to find and develop an effective macrofilaricide that would be used in combination with
ivermectin.

In conclusion, although this experiment has failed to
demonstrate that high and repeated doses of ivermectin or
doramectin are macrofilaricidal, it has shown that they
both have a profound effect on embryogenesis producing
a prolonged period of sterility in female worms. However,
simulation modelling suggests that ivermectin alone will
not interrupt transmission [36]. This appears to be born
out by epidemiological studies from the field where the
conclusion was that repeated ivermectin mass annual
treatment will not lead to the elimination of transmission
of onchocerciasis from West Africa though data on 6monthly treatments was not sufficient to draw a conclusion [39]. There is, therefore, still an urgent need to
continue the search for a safe effective macrofilaricidal
compound.
