Abstract
Background: Barley and particularly wheat are two grass species of immense agricultural importance. In spite of
polyploidization events within the latter, studies have shown that genotypically and phenotypically these species are very
closely related and, indeed, fertile hybrids can be created by interbreeding. The advent of two genome-scale Affymetrix
GeneChips now allows studies of the comparison of their transcriptomes.
Results: We have used the Wheat GeneChip to create a "gene expression atlas" for the wheat transcriptome (cv.
Chinese Spring). For this, we chose mRNA from a range of tissues and developmental stages closely mirroring a
comparable study carried out for barley (cv. Morex) using the Barley1 GeneChip. This, together with large-scale
clustering of the probesets from the two GeneChips into "homologous groups", has allowed us to perform a genomicscale comparative study of expression patterns in these two species. We explore the influence of the polyploidy of wheat
on the results obtained with the Wheat GeneChip and quantify the correlation between conservation in gene sequence
and gene expression in wheat and barley. In addition, we show how the conservation of expression patterns can be used
to elucidate, probeset by probeset, the reliability of the Wheat GeneChip.
Conclusion: While there are many differences in expression on the level of individual genes and tissues, we demonstrate
that the wheat and barley transcriptomes appear highly correlated. This finding is significant not only because given small
evolutionary distance between the two species it is widely expected, but also because it demonstrates that it is possible
to use the two GeneChips for comparative studies. This is the case even though their probeset composition reflects
rather different design principles as well as, of course, the present incomplete knowledge of the gene content of the two
species. We also show that, in general, the Wheat GeneChip is not able to distinguish contributions from individual
homoeologs. Furthermore, the comparison between the two species leads us to conclude that the conservation of both
gene sequence as well as gene expression is positively correlated with absolute expression levels, presumably reflecting
increased selection pressure on genes coding for proteins present at high levels. In addition, the results indicate the
presence of a correlation between sequence and expression conservation within the Triticeae.

Background
Considerable divergence has occurred between bread
wheat (Triticum aestivum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare)
since evolution from a common ancestor 10–14 million
years ago. Since then, these two members of the Triticeae
have been subjected to largely parallel processes of cultivation and domestication, starting in the fertile crescent
over 10,000 years ago [1]. Barley has remained diploid
with a base chromosome number of 7 (HH genome, 2n =
2x = 14) while bread wheat is the product of a series of
hybridization events between related species that has
resulted in an allo-hexaploid genome with three homoeologous sets of 7 chromosome pairs (AABBDD genome,
2n = 6x = 42 [2]). Despite these major genomic perturbations during its evolution, genetic mapping [3] and
detailed structural genomic studies [4] have shown that
the wheat and barley genomes are highly conserved.
Indeed, barley chromosomes can even be substituted for
wheat chromosomes [5]. As a consequence of its simplified genetics, many have suggested that barley is a good
genetic model for its genetically more complex cousin.
This assertion is supported by the broad range of common
morphological and developmental characteristics shared
by both species, though fundamental biological differences do exist (such as spike and spikelet morphology).
Polyploidization is common across the plant kingdom
and the process has been associated with a range of
changes in newly synthesized hybrids of several species.
These include the genome-wide removal of some (but not
all) duplicated, and hence redundant, genetic information, sub- and/or neo-functionalization of duplicated
genes, pseudogenization, differential cytosine methylation and epigenetic reprogramming of gene expression
(silencing and activation), and transposable element activation (reviewed in [6]). Levy and Feldman [7] summarized some of the major consequences resulting from the
recent polyploidization of the wheat genome. In common
with other plant species, the outcome for wheat was more
than simply the additive combination of genomes and
included many of the features described across the species
range [8-10].
Wheat is an important species for studying the impact of
polyploidization because it is a relatively recent polyploid. Moreover, the outcomes can be studied in very
early generations because it is possible to artificially resynthesize polyploids from their diploid and tetraploid
relatives. In such cases, epigenetic silencing of duplicated
genes appears to be a common response, with indications
of reciprocal silencing in different organs an early sign of
sub-functionalization [11-15]. Gene activation or silencing may also occur as a result of transcriptional interference associated with stochastic rearrangements of noncoding RNA [8]. Over longer time frames, the evolution-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/285

ary consequences of such events are better observed in
ancient polyploids. In Arabidopsis (an ancient tetraploid), for example, Blanc and Wolfe [16] reported that
more than half of the observed gene pairs retained in the
genome exhibited differential transcript abundance in different tissues. An immediate impact of polyploidy is
therefore to provide the raw genetic material for adaptation and the evolution of phenotype.
The close evolutionary relationship between wheat and
barley, reflected in largely parallel morphological and
developmental patterns, makes a comparison of their
transcriptomes particularly intriguing. It may provide
insight, for example, into consequences of speciation and
polyploidization. Ideally a genomic-scale comparison of
this sort would be carried out once the genomes have
been sequenced. This would permit the reliable disentanglement of the evolutionary relationships between individual genes and also provide the foundation on which to
build dependable expression analysis platforms. Regrettably, the size and complexity of the wheat and barley
genomes has been a major impediment to full-scale
sequencing, so that even the diploid barley genome is not
expected to be available before 2012 http://barleygen
ome.org/. In short, among plants comparative transcriptomics is rare: comprehensive pair-wise comparisons have
so far only been carried out in rice and Arabidopsis [17],
various cotton species [18] and in poplar and Arabidopsis
[19]. Recently, a three-way study between Arabidopsis,
poplar and rice has also appeared [20].
Compared to genome-wide studies, comparisons of
expression patterns of individual orthologous gene pairs,
individual gene families and/or in connection with a particular phenotypic characteristic are more frequent. For
example, Mangelsen et al. [21] compared, within a
number of tissues, expression patterns of members of the
WRKY transcription factor family among barley, rice and
Arabidopsis and found that, at least within this gene family, coordinated conservation of expression patterns and
sequence. Horvath et al. [22] found that groups of genes
associated with cell division were consistently expressed
preferentially in shoot apices in Arabidopsis, wild oats,
poplar and leafy spurge. Differential gene expression, on
the other hand, has been observed in some members of
the ZIP and NAS metal homeostatis gene families in two
closely related Arabidopsis species when exposed to both
low and high Zn levels, presumably associated with different Zn accumulation patterns in these two species [23].
Analogously, differential time-dependent expression of a
small number genes in response to salt stress in both barley (relatively salt tolerant) and rice (relatively salt sensitive) were studied by Ueda et al. [24], while Taji et al. [25]
performed a similar comparative study in salt cress (tolerant) and Arabidopsis (intolerant).

Comprehensive Affymetrix GeneChip platforms have
now been developed for both wheat and barley, based on
extensive EST collections for both species (Ref. [26]; http:/
/www.plexdb.org/index.php). The Barley1 GeneChip has
already been used to develop an atlas of gene expression
covering the entire developmental cycle of the barley cultivar Morex [27] and intra-species varietal comparisons
have been carried out both for Morex and Golden Promise
[27,28] as well as Morex and Steptoe [29,30]. Taking
advantage of these resources, we have sampled a similar
set of biological material collected through the developmental cycle of wheat (Chinese Spring), grown under
near-identical conditions to those in Druka et al. [27].
This permits the first comprehensive comparison of developmental expression patterns in these two important crop
species. We report on this transcriptome-wide comparison here. At the same time, in order to facilitate more
detailed studies of individual homologous genes motivated, say, by particular phenotypic differences as in [2125], we make available a convenient web-based comparative tool enabling access to the developmental expression
profiles of any individual wheat and barley homologs
probed by the two GeneChips.

the barley and wheat transcriptomes, the comprehensive
nature of the dataset means that it may be used by wheat
researchers seeking to explore correlations in transcript
levels across tissues to discover putatively co-regulated
and/or functionally related genes and it provides a baseline against which transcription in biotically or abiotically
stressed plants, other cultivars and mutants may be compared.

It is well known that meaningful comparative expression
analyses using microarray platforms based solely on EST
collections can be difficult because of the frequent and
confounding presence of multiple splice forms, paralogs
and orthologs, as well as, in the case of polyploids,
homoeologs with near-identical sequence [31]. Because
of this, we have also investigated, in some detail, the specificity of the Wheat GeneChip to individual homoeologs
and expended considerable effort to avoid misidentification of orthologs in the two species.

For the purpose of the comparison of the transcriptomes
of the two species, we found it convenient to define a set
of probesets, obtained by eliminating those probesets that
were potentially unreliable for various reasons (for
details, see Table 1 and Materials and Methods: The Wheat
GeneChip). This set of probesets will be referred to as the
"high quality" set throughout this paper. This resulted in
an expression dataset for 13,822 wheat probesets that
could be compared, across 13 tissues, with the equivalent
dataset obtained with 12,549 barley probesets hybridized
by Druka et al. [27].

Using single varieties as representatives for both barley
and wheat may to some extent be an oversimplification as
it is known that considerable variation can exist among
varieties of the same species. Indeed, extensive intra-species variation in barley has been used (employing the
Barley1 GeneChip) as a genotyping tool for a cross
between the barley varieties Steptoe and Morex [29,32]
and for expression polymorphisms among Morex, Steptoe, OWB REC, OWB DOM, Barke, Haruna Nijo, Golden
Promise and Optic (PLEXdb accession BB20, ArrayExpress
E-TABM-113). We compared the relative importance of
intra- and interspecies variation by making use of a common series of 6 tissues from the barley cultivars Golden
Promise and Morex (taken from Ref. [27]).

Results
Gene expression measurements were carried out on a
developmental tissue series for wild-type wheat (cv. Chinese Spring) using the Affymetrix Wheat GeneChip. Tissues and developmental stages were chosen to match the
barley (cv. Morex) tissue series of Druka et al. [27],
employing the Barley1 GeneChip, as closely as possible.
They consisted of root tissue at two different developmental stages, leaf, crown, caryopsis, anther, pistil, inflorescence, bracts, mesocotyl, endosperm, embryo and
coleoptile (for details, see Materials and Methods: Microarray experiment). This wheat expression dataset may be
obtained from and visualized at PLEXdb http://
www.plexdb.org, experiment TA3, or GEO http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo,
Experiment
GSE12508. Because the 61,115 probesets on the Wheat
GeneChip reflect the complete collection of publically
available wheat ESTs at the time of design of the chip, this
dataset serves as an 'expression atlas' for hexaploid wheat.
While in this paper we concentrate on the comparison of

Polyploidy and the Wheat GeneChip
A comparison of the transcriptomes of barley and wheat
is complicated by the fact that the latter is a hexaploid, but
the design of the probesets on the wheat GeneChip did
not specifically take this polyploidy into account. Hence,
depending on the stringency of the probeset design, an

expression profile obtained from the wheat GeneChip
may receive contributions from one, two or three homoeologs. This has the potential to complicate a comparative
study of gene expression in the two species. We explored
this issue by comparing the probes on the wheat GeneChip with known sequences of wheat homoeologs. In
Mochida et al. [33], ESTs for 90 genes were assigned to the
A, B and D genomes using nullisomic lines of Chinese
Spring. These authors found that 11 genes had one of the
homoeologs silenced while 79 exhibited transcript accumulation for all three homoeologs.
We extracted all 25-mer probe sequences on the wheat
GeneChip that exhibited a perfect match to this set of 79
× 3 = 237 sequences. Discarding probes from those
probesets which are known to either cross-hybridize or are
likely to hybridize inefficiently (for details, see Materials
and Methods: The Wheat GeneChip), as well as homoeologous triplets for which only a very small number (< 7) of
matching probes are present on the GeneChip, left 56
homoeolog triplets for which relatively reliable expression information was available from the microarray.
The distribution of matching probes for these 56 triplets is
shown in Figure 1. For more than half of the homoeologous triplets a significant number of probes (≥ 7, but in
most cases 10 or 11) from a single probeset match perfectly to all three copies of the gene. For many of the
remaining triplets either one or two homoeologs do not
significantly hybridize to any probesets. As indicated by
the three bars in the right half of Figure 1, only for five triplets can significant information be obtained from two or
more probesets. At first sight, this lack of specificity might
seem surprising, given that for these sequences the single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) frequency across the A,
B and D genomes is around 1 per 145 bases [33]. With this
SNP frequency, one might have naively expected to find
imperfect matches to any given homoeolog in roughly
every sixth probe. It is likely that the observed specificity
is lower than this because of the design of the wheat GeneChip, on which probes were specifically designed to the
conserved regions of consensus sequences. In any case, by
extrapolating from this rather small sample to the whole
dataset we conclude that it is likely that for over ~90% of
genes the measured expression profiles represent a sum of
the individual profiles of the relevant homoeologs.
Homolog identification on the Wheat and Barley1
GeneChips
Putative homologous sequences on the wheat and barley
GeneChips were inferred using a clustering approach
based on sequence similarity [34-38]. This methodology
was chosen over, for example, direct putative ortholog
identification via the traditional best reciprocal Blast hit
(RBH) method [39-41] because (a) the latter is known to

Homoeologous sequences and the Wheat GeneChip
Homoeologous sequences and the Wheat GeneChip.
The number of probesets with a significant (≥ 7) number of
probes matching to 237 homoeologous sequences known to
be expressed at some level is shown in this histogram. Categories are labelled as x/y, indicating that x out of 3 homoeologs are represented on the Wheat Genechip by y
probesets. For example, "3/1" means that all (or almost all)
probes from a single probeset match perfectly to all three
homoeologs of a gene and hence that individual contributions
from the homoeologs cannot be resolved; "3/2" indicates
that the contribution from one homoeolog can be resolved,
while the other two hybridize to a single probeset; similarly,
"2/1" indicates that two homoeologs match probes from a
single probeset, while the third homoeolog does not significantly hybridize to any probes. In only two cases, indicated
by "3/3", can the expression of each of the three homoeologs
be detected individually by probes from three separate
probesets, while in the majority of cases homoeologous triplets (51 out of 56) are significantly matched by probes from
only a single probeset.
be unreliable in the presence of multiple paralogs [42],
(b) the RBH method can lead to misidentifications due to
the incomplete coverage of the wheat and barley genomes
[43-45] and (c) the RBH method could not simultaneously detect the frequent presence of both 3' and 5' fragments of individual genes on the wheat GeneChip. For
details relating to this clustering, see Materials and Methods: Homolog identification on the wheat and barley
GeneChips.
As a resource for the Triticeae community, we have built
an on-line tool where these "homologous clusters", as
well as their associated expression profiles and sequence
annotation, can be interrogated. This tool, the WebComparator, is available at http://contigcomp.acpfg.com.au. It
may be used to assess similarities and differences of
expression profiles of 10,708 individual homologous
clusters. Expression profile differences may be due to biological differences, but quite frequently may simply reflect

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/285

problems with hybridization efficiencies for individual
probesets. The tool, therefore, is also useful in assessing
the reliability of individual probesets on the Affymetrix
Wheat and Barley1 GeneChips. Apart from similarities
and differences in expression profiles of genes in individual homologous clusters, underlying global patterns are
observable in the two datasets and it is those on which we
focus here.
Gene expression in wheat and barley is highly correlated
Direct gene-by-gene comparison of expression profiles in
wheat and barley is complicated by the ambiguities associated with the many-to-many relationships characteristic
of the homologous clusters. However, for the class of clusters consisting of exactly one wheat probeset and one barley probeset, ortholog association is less ambiguous: apart
from the aforementioned general insensitivity to individual wheat homoeologues, one would expect this class to
be enriched for probesets targeting single-copy and singlespliceform genes. Using only the "high quality" probesets
(Table 1), this group of clusters consists of 1,875 sequence
pairs.

Transcript profiles for these probesets are shown as heat
maps in Figure 2 where probesets have been sorted
according to a hierarchical clustering for the barley dataset, defined via a single linkage correlation measure. The
same pattern of gene expression is clearly visible in both
the barley and wheat heat maps indicating that, by and
large, gene expression in the two species is highly conserved. The same conclusion can be reached by inspection

of the correlation distribution shown in Figure 3. The
average correlation of the expression profile pairs in these
1,875 homologous clusters is 0.66.
Systematic relative shifts in expression levels are frequent
in wheat and barley
While expression profiles in wheat and barley are highly
correlated, it is also of interest to know whether the overall
level of expression is similar. In this case the Euclidean
distance between corresponding expression profiles
should be small. Indeed, the accumulation of points near
the origin of the Euclidean distance plot shown in Figure
4A confirms this to be generally true. However, there are
also a significant number of sequence pairs whose profiles
are of similar shape but offset by significant amounts
(boxed region in Figure 4A). An example of this, where
expression in barley is roughly 8 times that in wheat, is
shown in Figure 4C. The fact that there are many more
points in the upper half of the boxed region in Figure 4A
as compared to the lower half shows that if profiles are
offset in this way, it is generally barley that exhibits a
higher signal intensity than wheat. For comparison, Figure
4B presents an analogous plot to Figure 4A, involving the
two barley cultivars Morex and Golden Promise (data
taken from Ref. [27]). Comparison to Figure 4A shows
that, on the whole, differences between these two barley
varieties are negligible when compared to the differences
between the two species.

If this unexpected difference of signal intensities in wheat
and barley were to reflect an underlying difference in

Correlation of barley and wheat expression profiles
Correlation of barley and wheat expression profiles.
The correlation distribution of 1,875 barley and wheat
expression profiles is shown. Expression for putatively
orthologous genes in barley and wheat tends to be highly
correlated, with an average correlation of 0.66.

mRNA levels for these genes it would be of interest to
compare the corresponding protein levels in these two
species. This might indicate a surprising shift of regulatory
control from the transcriptional to the translational level.
However, because overall shifts in signal intensities as
measured by two different platforms can easily have a
technical origin we have sought to independently verify
the effect using quantitative real-time PCR (QPCR). The
results are shown in Figure 5, where microarray signal
intensities are plotted against expression levels as measured by QPCR for a number of different sequence pairs
(for details, see Materials and Methods: Quantitative RTPCR (QPCR) verifications). Four wheat and four barley
sequences where the overall microarray fluorescence
intensity in wheat is significantly higher than in barley are
indicated by "W". Three wheat and four barley sequences
where the microarray results for barley is significantly
higher than wheat are marked by "B". Five sequence pairs
where microarray fluorescence intensities are roughly the
same for the two species are indicated as plain data points
and were used to generate a calibration curve for the two
types of measurements. The uncertainty of this calibration, in the form of single prediction 95% confidence limits, is indicated by shaded regions in Figure 5.
We first concentrate on those data points, marked by a
"W", where the wheat profile obtained with the microarray is significantly higher than the corresponding barley
profile. Expression data for barley (Panel A, Figure 5)
show that these sequences exhibit a microarray fluorescence intensity that is significantly at odds with that
expected from the corresponding QPCR signal. At the

same time there is no sign of anomalous differences
between the QPCR and microarray measurements for the
corresponding wheat expression (Panel B, Figure 5). We
conclude from this that for those orthologous pairs for
which microarray measurements indicate expression in
barley to be systematically lower than in wheat (i.e. the
lower boxed portion in Figure 4A) the differences are
likely to be due to a deficient signal obtained from the
barley microarray, and not due to enhanced expression in
wheat. We defer comment on the likely origin of this deficiency to the Discussion section.
For sequence pairs where the barley profile is systematically higher than its wheat counterpart (i.e. those shown
in the upper boxed portion of Figure 4A and marked with
a "B" in Figure 5) the situation is less clear. These data
points do fall mostly within the calculated 95% confidence limits for a consistent QPCR and microarray signal
and the data is, therefore, consistent with the conclusion
that for a significant number of genes the transcriptional
activity in wheat is indeed below that in barley. We caution, however, that at this stage one also cannot rule out
that the discrepancy may be due to simultaneous small
shifts of technical rather than biological origin, causing
the barley fluorescence in the microarray data to be systematically increased and at the same time the wheat fluorescence to be systematically decreased somewhat from
what they should be.
5' Probesets on the Wheat GeneChip hybridize
unpredictably
The comparison of expression information between
wheat and barley provides a unique opportunity to assess
the reliability of the hybridization signal from the wheat
GeneChip. This is important because the wheat microarray contains, apart from the usual probesets designed for
sequences for which there is good evidence that they are
near the 3' end of the gene (such as the presence of a polyA tail), a large number of probesets for which this evidence does not exist (see Materials and Methods: The
Wheat GeneChip; for convenience, we refer to the latter as
"5' probesets"). Because of mRNA degradation away from
the 3' end, one might expect the latter to lead to a reduced
signal.

Individual 3' and 5' probesets can be inferred to correspond to the same gene if they both show strong sequence
similarity to a barley sequence but at the same time do not
have a significant similarity with each other. Indeed, of
the approximately 5,300 consensus sequences from the 5'
set homologous to a barley sequence, 78% can be associated to a wheat 3' sequence in this way. A subset of these
sequences is contained in the class of homologous clusters
shown in Figure 6A. There are 1,590 clusters of this type
in our dataset.

Similarities and differences between wheat and barley profiles
Similarities and differences between wheat and barley profiles. Panel A shows the Euclidean distance between wheat
and barley expression profiles (x-axis) plotted against the Euclidean distance between their 'centered' profiles (y-axis) for the
1,875 "high quality" sequence pairs. In a centered profile, expression is measured relative to the average across tissues. Positive
y-values correspond to average expression in barley greater than in wheat while negative y-values indicate average expression
in wheat greater than barley. Expression profiles which have the same shape and overall magnitude of expression fall close to
the origin of this plot, while expression profiles which have the same shape but are offset from each other simultaneously
exhibit a small relative distance but large absolute distance (boxed region). For comparison, Panel B shows the analogous plot,
on the same scale, for two barley cultivars Morex and Golden Promise (albeit over 6 rather than 13 tissues); data taken from
Ref. [27]). Panel C shows a typical barley (solid line) and wheat (dashed line) expression profile identified from the boxed
region in Panel A to be of similar shape but differing by an offset. In this case the offset corresponds to a signal intensity 8 times
higher in barley than wheat. The particular example shown here corresponds to the wheat contig TaAffx.78909.1.S1_at and
the barley Contig16549_at, annotated as a MYB transcription factor.

The distribution of correlations of the expression profiles
from this set of 3' and 5' wheat sequences is shown in Figure 6B. The typical correlation between the 3' wheat and
barley profile is quite high (mean = 0.57), while the correlation between the 5' wheat and barley profiles tends to
be considerably lower (mean = 0.32). It appears from this
that while some 5' wheat probesets might very well give a
reliable signal, on average the reliability is significantly
lower than that of the 3' wheat probesets. Additional evidence to support this conclusion is shown in Figure 6C
where the distribution in actual expression levels for both

the wheat 3' and wheat 5' probesets is shown along with
the expression levels in barley. It appears from this plot
that the signal from the 5' probesets is consistently substantially lower than the signal from the barley probesets.
Finally, a cursory inspection of profiles for any homologous cluster using the WebComparator http://contig
comp.acpfg.com.au/ shows that probesets from the 5' set
often don't show any significant hybridization. We conclude that one needs to interpret the signal from these
probesets with great care and for this reason we shall not
include them in our comparative analyses.

Validation of selected barley and wheat expression profiles via QPCR
Validation of selected barley and wheat expression profiles via QPCR. A comparison of logarithmic fluorescence
intensities, as measured on the microarrays, with logarithmic QPCR expression levels is shown. Barley data is shown in Panel
A and wheat data in Panel B. Four wheat and four barley sequences where the average microarray fluorescence intensity for
wheat is greater than barley give rise to the expression levels labelled by "W" (This comparison is carried out individually for
each of the eleven tissues, hence there are a total of 44 points marked "W"). Three wheat and four barley sequences where
the microarray fluorescence intensity for wheat is less than barley are marked by "B". Plain black data points indicate five
sequence pairs where the microarray fluorescence intensities for wheat and barley are comparable. Data from these five
sequence pairs were used to generate a calibration curve between the QPCR and microarray data in the form of a straight line
fit (solid line) and associated 95% single prediction confidence limits (shaded region).
Conservation and divergence of gene function in wheat
and barley
Gene and protein expression studies indicate that, in general, sequence divergence after duplication events is associated with a divergence of functionality in the resulting
paralogs, presumably because of reduced selection pressure after duplication [46,47]. In fact, it is widely believed
that gene duplication – either individually or as part of
genome-scale duplication events – is crucial for providing
the resource for the subsequent evolution of genes with
new functions [48,49]. Genome-wide studies of this
sequence divergence have mostly been undertaken in
sequenced organisms separated by reasonably large evolutionary distances. The wheat and barley tissues series permit such a study in these more closely related grass
species. Consider homologous clusters of the type presented in Figure 7. The type of cluster shown in Figure 7A
is consistent with a gene duplication event in wheat, with
subsequent sequence divergence of sequence W2. Similarly, Figure 7B is consistent with a gene duplication in
barley, with subsequent sequence divergence of sequence
B2. The "high quality" dataset contains 24 and 94 examples of this type of cluster, respectively.

A measure of functional divergence, on the other hand, is
once more provided by the correlation between wheat
and barley expression profiles. For the cluster shown in
Figure 7A, if the correlation between the profile for the
barley sequence B and the wheat sequence W1 (C(B, W1))
is similar to the correlation between B and W2(C(B, W2)),
one would conclude that there is little relation between

functional and sequence divergence. On the other hand,
C(B, W2) <C(B, W1) would indicate a possible relationship. The results of these comparisons are presented in
Table 2. The average correlation between the profiles for B
and W1 is higher than that for B and W2, and similarly the
profiles for W and B1 are on average more correlated than
those for W and B2. While the sample sizes are small, the
P-values associated with a Wilcoxon signed-rank test indicate that these differences are likely to be significant. In
short, wheat and barley apparently exhibit a correlation
between divergence of gene function and gene sequence
akin to that found in less closely related species.
Dosage constraints in wheat and barley
While gene duplication provides opportunities for the
evolution of new gene function, it has also been argued
that selective pressure can maintain original function after
a duplication event. This might occur if the gene codes for
part of a protein complex [50], thus imposing strong stoichiometric constraints, or if 'buffering' of crucial functions [51] is required. In addition, studies in yeast [52]
and Paramecium [53] indicate that dosage constraints
may account for the inhibition of divergence of duplicated genes. These authors found that, at least in these two
species, duplicate copies of genes are more likely to be
retained if the expression level is high than if it is low, presumably in order to maintain high transcript levels.

We have compared the wheat and barley transcriptomes
to see if such a correlation between maintenance of gene
function and expression level persists in these two species.

Figure 6
Expression differences between wheat 3' and 5' probesets
Expression differences between wheat 3' and 5' probesets. Comparison of expression profiles for wheat and barley
allows an assessment of the reliability of the wheat 5' probesets. Homologous clusters of the type shown in Panel A suggest the
simultaneous presence of both a 3' (W1) and 5' (W2) wheat probeset for the same gene that, at the same time, is homologous
to a particular barley gene. The correlation of the expression profiles of these 3' and 5' probesets are shown in Panel B. On
average, the profiles obtained from the 5' probesets show significantly lower correlation with that of their barley homologs
than do the 3' probesets. This can also be seen in the distribution of the expression values themselves in Panel C. In general,
expression values as measured by the 5' probesets tends to be much lower than those of their barley counterparts (solid line),
while the signal from the corresponding 3' probesets shows a distribution roughly similar to that of the barley homologs.

Again, we use conservation of the expression profiles (i.e.
the correlation) between wheat and barley genes as an
indirect measure of conservation of function. The results,
using all wheat and barley probesets from the "high quality" set linked by a reciprocal Blast hit, are shown in Figure
8A. Genes that are expressed at a higher level tend to be
genes which have more correlated expression profiles. In
order to make sure that this is not an artefact of noise
washing out underlying correlations at low expression levels we confirmed that the trends shown in Figure 8A persist even if genes with low expression levels (e.g. less than
7) in any tissue are left out of the analysis. Finally, one
sees that the same correlation persists if one uses sequence
similarity instead of profile similarity as a measure for
conservation of gene function (Figure 8B). We conclude,
therefore, that for wheat and barley the maintenance of
high expression levels is a significant driver in maintaining gene function.

Discussion
Gene expression in wheat and barley is highly correlated
Our results (Figures 2 and 3) indicate highly correlated
gene expression for the subset of barley and wheat genes
in the 'high-quality set' that belong to homologous clusters with exactly one member from each species. While
this restriction makes ortholog identification relatively
unambiguous, it also leads to a biased sample: by construction, this selection is enriched for genes that are not
members of gene families and/or genes where the
sequence differences between homoeologs are small (or
only one of the homoeologs is functional). It is quite possible, even plausible, that the average correlation of a
broader gene set that includes members of gene families
may differ from the value 0.66 observed in our more
restricted set. Indeed, if the presence of gene family members is taken to indicate increased redundancy, one might
well expect that the average correlation of expression lev-

els might reduce. While, given the lack of reliable
sequence information, it is not feasible to test this conjecture at present, it is interesting to note that our restricted
sample of 1875 sequence pairs exhibits, on average,
higher expression levels than the complete "high-quality
set": expression levels in barley appear increased marginally by 37%, while in wheat they are roughly doubled.
Conservation and divergence of gene function in wheat
and barley
The evolution of new functional roles for duplicated genes
can depend on a number of mechanisms. Most directly,
accumulation of sequence changes in coding regions can
lead to changes in protein structure, either by substitution
of amino acids or through the evolution of new splice variants. This type of sequence divergence after gene duplication is well documented [47]. Numerous studies have
observed the expected decreased selective pressure on
sequence conservation after duplication through comparisons of synonymous and non-synonymous nucleotide

conservation.

substitutions [54]. A second mechanism is provided
through alteration of gene regulation imparted through
mutation in cis-acting elements and/or alterations of
trans-acting factors. This alters a gene's expression repertoire even in the absence of changes in its sequence. The
relationship between these two mechanisms also sheds
light on the importance of selective pressure in the evolutionary process; random drift under a neutral model
would result in unrelated expression and sequence
changes, while strong selective pressure would be reflected
by a positive correlation.
The results in Table 2 provide an indication that gene
activity patterns across tissues and accumulation of
sequence changes after gene duplication are positively
correlated in wheat and barley, as one would expect in the
presence of selective pressure [55]. This finding is in agreement with some of the studies in model species such as
yeast [56], C. elegans [57], Drosophila [58] and primates
[59]. However, these results are by no means universal
and in other studies no clear correlation is observed [60].
For example, no [61] or weak [16] correlation was
observed in two studies using the model plant Arabidopsis.
It is likely that the lack of agreement reflects differences in
approach; for example, in some studies sequence divergence is measured on the protein level, in others it is
quantified through the rate of non-synonymous substitutions and others through the rate of synonymous substitutions. In some studies tandem duplications are
separated out from ancient segmental duplications, while
in others (including ours) they are not. Expression divergence, on the other hand, will clearly depend on the
number and types of different temporal, spatial and environmental conditions which are probed.
We believe that at present the results shown in Table 2
should be seen as indicative only. Gene duplication and
subsequent divergence is only one possible source for the
apparently correlated divergence of sequence and expression. A second source for this correlation might be found
in the generation of new alternative splice forms rather
than new genes, with the original splice form maintaining
its expression pattern but the new one diverging.
Furthermore, as opposed to the species mentioned above,
wheat and barley do not have sequenced genomes and
this naturally has an influence on the reliability of the
available sequence and expression information. Here
sequence divergence was assessed purely on the basis of
the existence (for W1 and B1 in Figure 7) and absence (W2
and B2) of a Blast hit of sufficient quality. This is a cruder
measure than a count of synonymous substitutions, and
other effects such as a reduced sequence length of W2 and
B2 due to incomplete EST information could easily impact
on this. In addition, our sample size is quite small because

Dosage constraints on gene evolution. In Panel A, the correlation between expression profiles of wheat and barley genes
linked by reciprocal Blast hits in the homologous clusters is plotted against the overall mean expression level for these gene
pairs. The profiles exhibit higher correlation if the actual expression levels themselves are high, suggesting that gene function
tends to be more conserved for highly expressed genes. In Panel B, the mean expression is plotted against sequence similarity
(i.e. E-values of the Blast hits), indicating that there is an analogous correlation between the level of expression and sequence
similarity.

it includes only those homologous graphs that we considered to be the most reliable, i.e. those containing the Blast
hits of the type shown in Figure 7. Notwithstanding these
qualifications, these latter issues would tend to reduce any
underlying correlation, so the presence of these in Table 2
may actually be relatively robust. We also note that any
remaining cross-hybridization between W1 and W2 (or B1
and B2), which we have sought to eliminate by considering only the "high-quality" dataset that doesn't contain
"_x,s,a_at" probesets, would also tend to reduce any difference in the correlation signal. Improved knowledge of
the sequence content of these two species will increase the
reliability of the signal that we have observed.
A second effect apparent in Table 2 should be treated with
even more caution. The expression profiles of duplicated
wheat genes appear to be considerably less similar to that
of their barley ortholog (correlation coefficients ~0.33 &
0.15) than duplicated barley genes and their wheat
ortholog (correlation coefficients ~0.51 & 0.43). These
correlations can be compared to those 1,875 sequence
pairs discussed earlier where there is no evidence of gene
and/or splice form duplication (correlation ~0.66). While
it might be tempting to conclude that expression patterns
in wheat evolve faster than their counterparts in barley,
this signal is sensitive to any asymmetry in design of the
two GeneChips. In particular, as discussed in [26] and at
http://www.affymetrix.com, the EST clustering procedures
used in the construction of the Barley1 and Wheat Genechips was rather different, particularly in their treatment
of potential splice-variants. It could well be these differ-

ences has led to differing proportions of probesets on the
two GeneChips designed to individual splice forms.
Because both alternative splice forms as well as gene
duplications potentially contribute to the asymmetries in
Table 2, a differing admixture of the two could easily be
responsible for this asymmetry between the species.
Highly expressed genes show correlated expression in
wheat and barley
Numerous studies have shown that genes transcribed at
high levels tend to evolve more slowly than genes transcribed at low levels [62-64]. As already mentioned above,
the "rate of evolution" in this type of study is quantified
by sequence divergence, either on the DNA level by counting synonymous and/or non-synonymous substitutions
or on the protein level by counting amino acid changes.
The results shown in Figure 8B show that this correlation
between sequence conservation and mean expression
level can clearly be seen in the wheat and barley transcriptomes, even though we use the comparatively rough
measure of a Blast hit E-value to quantify sequence similarity.
Systematic shifts in expression levels and platform
dependant biases
While differential hybridization signal (i.e. fluorescence)
intensities in a select number of tissues are highly likely to
be indicative of true biological differences between wheat
and barley, great care must be taken in interpreting overall
shifts of fluorescence levels in the same way. The RNA

extractions for these experiments were performed in two
different laboratories and, of course, with different species
using GeneChips with two different design philosophies.
RNA hybridization to the GeneChips, on the other hand,
was performed at the same facility in a virtually identical
manner. Even issues such as the poor hybridization efficiency of the large number of wheat 5' probesets are likely
to have an impact on the relative normalization. Without
an absolute standard, a rigorous relative calibration of the
two datasets therefore seems very difficult, if not impossible. Our approach to this issue was two-fold: firstly, while
one might not be able to control the overall normalization uncertainty one can attempt to estimate its importance and secondly, as described, we performed
additional QPCR measurements in an attempt to verify
interesting outcomes.
An estimate of the overall normalization uncertainty is
provided by the data shown in Figure 4A. For these data,
the average difference in (logarithmic) fluorescence levels
is around 0.8, indicating that on average the fluorescence
levels for the barley data are about 75% higher than the
corresponding levels for the wheat data. Under the
assumption that the true average expression level in the
two species is similar one would conclude that overall
normalization issues may account for a factor of around 2
between the datasets. The differences, often 10-fold or
more, of the observed fluorescence levels shown in Figures 4C and 5 makes this an unlikely explanation.
For those probesets where there is a systematic decrease in
the observed fluorescence levels in barley as compared to
wheat, the barley QPCR results do not confirm the barley
microarray results. This indicates that for these probesets,
at least, the difference has a technical rather than biological origin. An obvious possibility for a lack of signal is the
possible presence of single feature polymorphisms (SFPs;
see Ref. [28]) between the probes on the Barley1 array and
the Morex mRNA being hybridized to it. If this is the case,
the rough consistency of QPCR and microarray results for
wheat, for those probesets with enhanced microarray fluorescence levels in barley, would indicate that the SFPs do
not play as much of a role in the hybridization of Chinese
Spring to the wheat GeneChip as they do for the hybridization of Morex to the Barley1 GeneChip.
There is corroborating evidence supporting this conjecture. The Barley1 GeneChip was designed using the ESTs
collected from 84 libraries, originating from EST projects
in Japan, Finland, Germany, Scotland, and the US, respectively. Five major and a few minor cultivars were used,
representing the favorite from each project. In the end, the
majority of these ESTs were from Barke (Germany) and, to
a lesser extent, Morex (US) [26]; in total, only about 1 in
7 ESTs used to design Barley1 came from Morex [28]. The
dominant cultivar in the EST collections used to design

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/285

the wheat GeneChip, on the other hand, is Chinese
Spring. One would, therefore, expect a greater prevalence
of SFPs between Morex mRNA and the probes on the
Barley1 GeneChip as compared to SFPs between Chinese
Spring mRNA and the probes on the wheat GeneChip. We
have compared the sequences in current publicly available
EST collections against the probe sequences on the two
GeneChips and find that this is indeed the case: from this
comparison, we estimate that the probability of any mismatch between a 25mer barley probe and Morex sequence
to be around 2.9% while for the wheat GeneChip the
probability of a mismatch between a probe and a Chinese
Spring sequence is around 1.5%. Assuming independence, this implies that in Figure 4A of the order of ten or
so Barley1 GeneChip probesets may contain more than
two SFPs when compared to Morex sequences, while for
Chinese Spring the effect is negligible. In other words,
SFPs between the two cultivars and their respective GeneChips may indeed be responsible, qualitatively and quantitatively, for the discrepancies between the QPCR and
microarray results observed for barley but not wheat.

Conclusion
We have performed a comparative study of gene expression in barley and hexaploid wheat, using 13 different tissues and developmental stages. The comparison has been
achieved through the clustering of almost 84,000 wheat
and barley sequences represented on the Affymetrix wheat
and barley GeneChips into homologous clusters, with
over 10,700 clusters containing more than one sequence.
Detailed comparisons of expression profiles for all of
these sequences have been made available at http://con
tigcomp.acpfg.com.au and individually the two gene
expression atlases can be explored further at http://
www.plexdb.org, accession numbers BB3 and TA3.
We have established that on the whole there are strong
similarities between expression patterns of homologous
genes in the two species. This conclusion could only be
reached, however, by first taking into account the differing
designs of the two GeneChips. Among several confounding factors, the most significant is the presence of over
32,000 probesets on the wheat GeneChip not clearly
anchored to the 3' end of gene sequences. The expression
profiles obtained with these probesets and, particularly,
the comparison to expression profiles of homologous barley sequences clearly shows that most lead to a significantly compromised signal. In this way, our comparative
results provide a significant resource aiding the interpretation of the hybridization signal from individual probesets
in future experiments employing the wheat GeneChip.
Our results indicate that the hybridization signal obtained
from the wheat GeneChip generally does not differentiate
between wheat homoeologs. Detailed study of homoeolog expression patterns across tissues awaits the conPage 12 of 17

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:285

struction of microarray platforms that specifically target
regions of homoeolog sequence divergence and/or studies
employing direct transcriptome sequencing.
Finally, we have used several high-quality subsets of our
expression datasets to investigate some of the more prominent, but nevertheless comparatively small, systematic
differences between the wheat and barley data. As is to be
expected, we found that great care must be taken to distinguish genuine differences in the transcriptomes from artifactual differences due either to the dissimilar design of
the GeneChips and/or the disparity in our current knowledge of the wheat and barley genomes. Examples of the
latter include a systematic shift in absolute expression
found in a significant number of wheat and barley putative orthologs. On the other hand, we also found a comparatively clear indication that highly expressed wheat
and barley genes tend to be evolutionarily conserved,
both in sequence as well as transcriptional activity. This
observation for these two grasses is in agreement with
results from previous studies of model species.

Methods
Experiment design
Wild-type wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Chinese Spring)
was grown in a temperature-controlled growth room with
16 h light (22°C) and 8 h dark (16°C) at approximately
80% humidity. Thirteen plant tissues were selected to represent the major stages of wheat development and to mirror the experiment of Ref. [27] for barley (cv. Morex). The
number of plants harvested and the developmental stages
selected are as described in [27], with the following exception: while in the latter samples were collected for three
stages of caryopsis (namely, 5, 10 and 16 DAP), for wheat
only caryopsis 3–5 DAP was used. Three independent biological samples (replicates) represented a tissue type.

RNA isolation and quality checking were performed as
described in Ref. [27]. Labeling and hybridization to the
Affymetrix wheat GeneChip was carried out at the Iowa
State University GeneChip facility http://www.bio
tech.iastate.edu/facilities/genechip/Genechip.htm. Background subtraction and normalization for both experiments was performed using the RMA normalization
procedure [65,66] and the three biological replicates were
averaged. The data is expressed on a logarithmic scale
(base 2), as usual.
Data access
All detailed data and protocols from these experiments
have been deposited in PLEXdb http://www.plexdb.org/,
a unified public resource for gene expression for plants
and plant pathogens. Files are categorized under accession
TA3 for the wheat gene atlas and BB3 for the barley gene
atlas. TA3 has also been deposited at NCBI-GEO as accession GSE12508.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/285

The Wheat GeneChip
It is crucial to take into account the different design philosophies of the Affymetrix wheat and barley GeneChips
when comparing the transcriptome data obtained with
them. In order to maximize the reliability of results we
impose rigorous constraints to arrive at a set of probesets
that may be judged to be reliable. The design of the
Barley1 GeneChip has already been discussed in detail in
Ref. [26]. Additional information on both GeneChips can
be found in the technical support section of http://
www.affymetrix.com. Here we briefly summarize the relevant details of the wheat GeneChip. This GeneChip contains, apart from a small number of reporters and
controls, 61,115 probesets. All but 73 of these are made
up of 11 25-mer perfect-match (and accompanying mismatch) probes. As is usual for these GeneChips, there are
a number of probesets where one or more probes are
known to cross-hybridize in one way or another (for
details, see Appendix B of the "GeneChip Expression analysis manual" available at http://www.affymetrix.com):
their names are suffixed by "_s_at" (2617 probesets),
"_x_at" (6766 probesets) and "_a_at" (3321 probesets).
Because of the danger of unwanted cross-hybridization
complicating ortholog identification across the two species, as well as the fact that in any case these probesets are
often provided in addition to uniquely hybridizing
probesets, we do not include them in the comparative
analysis carried out in this paper. For the same reason, the
results presented here only make use of those probesets
from the Barley1 GeneChip for which ESTs could be
assembled into a contig. Singleton ESTs tend to have
shorter sequence, increasing the chance that confusion
arises when trying to match them to a particular sequence
present on the other GeneChip. Finally, in our comparative analysis we also disregard the 10,643 probesets
marked with the suffix ".A1" because they are predominantly of the wrong orientation.

Furthermore, the wheat GeneChip includes a considerable number of probesets not clearly anchored to the 3' end
(32,578 out of 61,115; Close and Davies, personal communication). These form part of the so-called "prune" set
in Affymetrix's design pipeline and are usually used for
checking probes for potential cross hybridization
Throughout this paper we refer to these as "5' sequences".
This type of sequence was not included on the Barley1
GeneChip because, while they may be useful for gene discovery, their hybridization efficiency is unreliable. Unless
explicitly indicated otherwise, we do not consider them in
our comparative analysis.
Finally, as discussed below, an additional quality control
on the GeneChip sequences was obtained by demanding
that the relative orientation of the consensus sequences
on the barley and wheat GeneChips should be the same.

Our comparative analysis leaves out sequences with
opposite or inconsistent orientation on the two chips.
After all these cuts, 13,822 wheat probesets and 12,549
barley probesets remained and it was this set that we used.
We stress, however, that expression results from all
probesets have been included in the data contained in the
WebComparator http://contigcomp.acpfg.com.au.
Homolog identification on the Wheat and Barley
GeneChips
We identified putative wheat and barley homologs using
the following approach

1) After constructing non-redundant sets of consensus
and exemplar sequences for the wheat and barley GeneChips, respectively, we performed all possible wheat-barley, barley-wheat, wheat-wheat and barley-barley
sequence comparisons using NCBI's gapped Blastn [67]
algorithm. The intra-species comparisons were performed
in order to avoid, as much as possible, issues associated
with the incomplete representation of the wheat and barley genomes on the two GeneChips.

The results are quite insensitive to the choices for C and T;
the precise value of C tends to be immaterial because
either I = J (i.e. an intra-species comparison), in which
case the best Blast hit naturally almost always links the
sequence back to itself with an E-value of 0, or – if I ≠ J (an
inter-species comparison) – the general similarity
between wheat and barley sequences ensures that if a
homolog is present at all it tends to have a similarity very
much better than E ~ 10-50. The precise value of T, on the
other hand, is not critical for a similar reason; most Blast
hits are found to be either very close to the best Blast hit
(usually with an E-value within a factor of 100 or so of the
best E-value) or considerably further removed. In other
words, while we have not attempted to distinguish
homoeologs, paralogs and orthologs (only a phylogenetic
treatment can do this), by using the above approach the
detection of homologs in general is relatively unambiguous.

2) A directed graph was constructed from the results of
these sequence comparisons, with the nodes consisting of
the non-redundant sequences. A directed edge starting at
node i (being a sequence from genome I) and ending at
node j (a sequence from genome J) was defined to exist if
a) node j was the best Blast hit to node i when sequence i
was compared to genome J and this Blast hit had an Evalue better than the cut-off C = 10-50, or b) if the Blast hit
had an E-value within a tolerance T = 10-5 of that of the
best Blast hit (if the best Blast hit had an E-value of 0 then
this limit was taken to be within 10-5 of machine precision
instead). Note that keeping Blast hits which are close to
the best Blast hit is useful if several homoeologs with nearidentical sequence are present and/or if probesets have
been tiled to both the 3' and 5' end of the same sequence,
as was done for the wheat GeneChip.

Typically, the homology graphs are rather small: only 105
out of a total of 10,708 non-trivial homology graphs contain more than 10 vertices. A much larger number of these
graphs, just over 40,000, are found to be 'trivial' in the
sense that they contain only 1 node, i.e. for these
sequences, the Blast searches did not result in a significant
hit to any other sequences. This should not be interpreted
to mean that there are large numbers of genes in wheat
and barley having no counterpart in the other species.
Rather, inspection of the trivial graphs shows that about
57% of them correspond to 5' wheat sequences (presumably not having a significant overlap with the typically
longer barley sequences) and slightly less than 10% correspond to short barley ESTs rather than longer contigs. It is
to be expected that most of the remaining 13,000
sequences or so are unmatched because the two GeneChips do not represent the entire complement of genes
from the two species. In principle, the number of trivial
graphs could be reduced by increasing C considerably;
however, we did not do so in order not to increase the
number of false positive associations.

3) Finally, the resulting graph was decomposed into connected sub-graphs (termed "homology graphs"), with
those sequences contained within a sub-graph defining a
putative "homologous cluster".

Quantitative RT-PCR (QPCR) verifications
cDNA was synthesized from the same RNA that was
hybridized to the wheat and barley GeneChips for 11 of
the 13 tissues (excluding anthers and pistils). While three

Primer sequence details used in the Q-PCR verification of selected barley and wheat expression profiles and the size of the corresponding RNA
products.

independent RNA samples were used in the microarray
experiment, the QPCR cDNA was prepared for only one of
the three RNA samples. Results from this sample were
compared to the microarray results from the same sample.
Templates of 5 μg total RNA for barley and 0.5 μg total
RNA for wheat were used for the cDNA synthesis reaction
with Superscript III RNAse H-Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Australia) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
Four control genes were assessed (actin, GAPdH, EFA and
cyclophilin). The primers for the barley control genes are
described in Ref. [68], while the wheat primers are listed
in Table 3. The selection of barley and wheat probesets
used for the comparison of microarray and QPCR results
was drawn from the boxed region indicated in Figure 4A
and is summarized in Table 4. Three groups of sequences
were examined: two of these involved sequences (mostly
sequence pairs) giving rise to intensity profiles similar to
those shown in Figure 4C, with either wheat or barley having a higher overall intensity, while the third group consisted of sequence pairs whose fluorescence intensity
profiles did not show significant intensity differences in
the microarray experiments. These were either sequence
pairs that did not show significant intensity differences in

the microarray experiments or individual sequences used
as internal controls for the QPCR experiments. Primer
sequences designed from the corresponding consensus
sequences are also shown in Table 4. Normalization factors were calculated from the three best control genes as
described by Vandesompele et al. [69]. The QPCR was carried out as described by Crismani et al. [70].
