Abstract
Background: The process of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is believed to be widespread in
Bacteria and Archaea, but little comparative data is available addressing its occurrence in complete
microbial genomes. Collection of high-quality, automated HGT prediction data based on
phylogenetic evidence has previously been impractical for large numbers of genomes at once, due
to prohibitive computational demands. DarkHorse, a recently described statistical method for
discovering phylogenetically atypical genes on a genome-wide basis, provides a means to solve this
problem through lineage probability index (LPI) ranking scores. LPI scores inversely reflect
phylogenetic distance between a test amino acid sequence and its closest available database
matches. Proteins with low LPI scores are good horizontal gene transfer candidates; those with
high scores are not.
Description: The DarkHorse algorithm has been applied to 955 microbial genome sequences, and
the results organized into a web-searchable relational database, called the DarkHorse HGT
Candidate Resource http://darkhorse.ucsd.edu. Users can select individual genomes or groups of
genomes to screen by LPI score, search for protein functions by descriptive annotation or amino
acid sequence similarity, or select proteins with unusual G+C composition in their underlying
coding sequences. The search engine reports LPI scores for match partners as well as query
sequences, providing the opportunity to explore whether potential HGT donor sequences are
phylogenetically typical or atypical within their own genomes. This information can be used to
predict whether or not sufficient information is available to build a well-supported phylogenetic
tree using the potential donor sequence.
Conclusion: The DarkHorse HGT Candidate database provides a powerful, flexible set of tools for
identifying phylogenetically atypical proteins, allowing researchers to explore both individual HGT
events in single genomes, and large-scale HGT patterns among protein families and genome groups.
Although the DarkHorse algorithm cannot, by itself, provide definitive proof of horizontal gene
transfer, it is a flexible, powerful tool that can be combined with slower, more rigorous methods
in situations where these other methods could not otherwise be applied.

Background
Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) can be defined as the
process by which an organism incorporates new genetic
material from sources other than its parents or direct
ancestors. This process is believed to be widespread in
Bacteria and Archaea [1,2], but little comparative data is
available addressing its occurrence on a genome-wide
basis. The exponentially increasing availability of complete microbial genome sequences should provide a powerful tool for exploring this phenomenon, but this
promise has not yet been realized, due to the difficulty of
obtaining consistent, reliable, quantitative HGT prediction data for multiple genomes in an automated, highthroughput pipeline.
Determining phylogenetic incongruence of individual
genes by building phylogenetic trees is generally considered the most trustworthy way to prove that HGT has
occurred [3,4], but is very time consuming and computationally intensive. Although programs to automate this
process have been developed [5,6], parameter choices and
data interpretation often require expert manual attention
for each individual gene, as well as each genome, in order
to achieve satisfactory performance [7]. Comparisons
between genes having different rates of protein evolution,
as well as organisms at varying phylogenetic distances, are
particularly challenging.
Alternatively, a large number of methods exist for predicting HGT by determining whether individual genes have
atypical nucleic acid compositions or "signatures", compared to other sequences from the same genome. These
methods are fast and automated, but suffer from high
rates of false positive and false negative predictions [8-10].
They are only able to detect a limited subset of potential
HGT events, which have occurred relatively recently,
between organisms with widely divergent nucleic acid
compositions. Also, signature-based methods are unable
to provide any information about potential donor sources
for the transferred material.
Recently, a new algorithm called DarkHorse has been
developed for rapid, automated identification of phylogenetically atypical proteins from whole genomes, using a
combination of sequence alignment, database mining,
statistical, and linguistic analysis tools [11]. This combination provides many of the advantages of phylogenetic
tree-building methods, without the computational overhead. It is particularly well suited to automated, highthroughput screening of whole genomes at widely varying
evolutionary distances, as well as analysis of proteins having different degrees of sequence conservation. Although
this method cannot, by itself, provide definitive proof of
horizontal gene transfer, it is a flexible, powerful tool that
can be combined with slower, more rigorous methods in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/419

situations where these other methods could not otherwise
be applied. The DarkHorse algorithm has now been implemented in a new software program, and applied to 955
sequenced bacterial and archaeal genomes, including
more than 3 million predicted proteins. A searchable
database of results is accessible through an Internet website interface, where users can explore HGT patterns for
individual genes, genomes, or groups of genomes.

Construction and content
Software design and implementation
The DarkHorse algorithm [11] has been implemented as a
pipeline of unix command-line Perl scripts, integrated
with an underlying MySQL relational database. The software comprising this pipeline is available for download at
the following website: http://darkhorse.ucsd.edu.

Program execution requires locally available copies of the
NCBI Genbank nr protein sequence database [12] and the
NCBI Taxonomy database [13], as well the MySQL server
program [14]. Prior to first-time program execution, a
local reference database must be constructed and populated with metadata about each Genbank nr sequence,
according to the schema shown in Additional file 1. This
process is accomplished by an automated script, which
extracts descriptive annotation and name of the source
species associated with each Genbank fasta format
sequence, then inserts the information into a relational
database table. This table is linked to local copies of the
NCBI taxonomy database names and nodes tables, and to
a colon-delimited lineage string for each species, similar
to those displayed on the NCBI Taxonomy Browser website [15]. The DarkHorse software obtains lineages by joining the taxonomy names and nodes tables and recursively
traversing parent nodes for each species until reaching the
root of the taxonomy tree (tax_id = 1).
Once the initial database tables have been loaded, program execution proceeds as described previously [11]. All
predicted proteins in a query genome are first subjected to
a non-stringent BLAST search against the Genbank nr
database to identify potential protein orthologs. Search
results are filtered to remove self-matches, then a set of
one or more candidate orthologs is selected for each query
based on a bitscore window, uniquely sized for each protein.
Ortholog candidate window sizes are calculated by combining the highest non-self bitscore for each individual
query with a genome-wide heuristic called a filter threshold value. Filter threshold values, which typically range
from 2% to 20%, are empirically selected for each genome
based on abundance of phylogenetically related
sequences in the Genbank nr database. Sparsely represented genomes receive lower threshold filter values,

Page 2 of 12
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Bioinformatics 2008, 9:419

resulting in narrower windows, while abundantly represented genomes receive higher threshold values, corresponding to wider windows.
In practice, the lower limit of the bitscore window for each
query is defined by first multiplying the highest non-self
bitscore for that query by the filter threshold value, then
subtracting this product from the top bitscore. As an
example, the window for a query protein with a top
bitscore of 1000 from a genome with threshold value of
10% would select all matches with bitscores between 900
and 1000 as candidate orthologs. Another, shorter protein
from the same genome, with a top bitscore of only 500,
would use a selection window of bitscores between 450
and 500. However, if these two query sequences came
from a different, more poorly represented species, with a
threshold filter value of 5%, the window sizes would have
been 950–1000 and 475–500 respectively. Window size
adjustments using this procedure have been shown to
improve DarkHorse algorithm performance by removing
both false positive and false negative ortholog candidates
from consideration [11].
A unique feature of the DarkHorse algorithm is the calculation of a lineage probability index (LPI) score to identify
the most phylogenetically likely match from each set of
ortholog candidates. LPI scores reflect phylogenetic distance of the database match sequence from the query
organism. Matches from organisms at similar phylogenetic distances receive similar LPI scores, regardless of the
database abundance of their parent species.
LPI scores are calculated as described previously [11]. Lineages associated with ortholog candidates are first split
into individual component "terms", remembering the relative position of each term. An overall frequency is calculated for each individual term relative to the entire query
genome. The lineage terms associated with each ortholog
candidate are then recombined to calculate a weighted
composite score for the candidate. This score is based on
the sum of component terms, with higher weight given to
more general terms (appearing closer to the left end of the
original lineage string, at a higher taxonomic level).
Weighted composite scores are normalized to account for
differences in number of terms per lineage. For each query
protein, the ortholog candidate with the highest composite LPI score is chosen as the "best" match. Finally, all LPI
scores for proteins within a genome are divided by the
highest score obtained for that genome, so that final
scores are all normalized to values between zero and one.
Raw output from the DarkHorse program is formatted as a
tab-delimited text file, which includes not only LPI scores
for each query sequence, but also information on the
abundance of protein relatives in the database (candidate

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/419

set size), BLAST alignment quality statistics, descriptive
annotation, and phylogenetic lineage of the "best" match
sequence, representing the closest database relative of
potential donor organisms.
Data generation procedures
The DarkHorse program was applied to 955 bacterial and
archaeal genomes, and used to populate additional relational database tables according to the schema shown in
Additional file 2. Genomes analyzed included both finished sequences, downloaded from NCBI Genbank [16],
and draft sequences downloaded from the JGI Integrated
Microbial Genomes website [17], and the JCVI Moore
Marine Microbial Sequencing Project website [18]. For
each genome, an initial, low stringency BLAST search was
performed for all predicted protein sequences against
Genbank nr, saving as many as 500 alignments per query
protein. Each saved alignment was required to cover at
least 70% of both query and subject sequences, with an evalue of 1e-5 or lower. Out of 3,175,949 predicted proteins in 955 genomes, 2,809,612 had non-self BLAST
matches meeting these minimum requirements. Some of
the remaining 366,337 unmatched sequences may reflect
inaccurate bioinformatic prediction of coding sequence
boundaries, but many represent bona fide novel proteins.

Self-exclusion keywords were selected for each genome
using the NCBI taxonomy database tables to identify
names and taxonomy id numbers associated with that
genome at the genus, species, and strain level. Organismspecific keywords were supplemented with a standardized
set of control terms, designed to exclude cloning vectors,
synthetic sequences, and phylogenetically unclassified
sequences.
DarkHorse searches were performed using three different
sets of self-exclusion keywords for each genome, corresponding to the different phylogenetic granularity settings
named "strain", "species", and "genus". Taking Burkholderia cenocepacia AU 1054 as an example, strain level granularity would permit matches to organisms like
Burkholderia cenocepacia PC184 and Burkholderia cenocepacia MC0-3, but exclude matches to all database entries
labeled as belonging to strain AU1054. Species level granularity would exclude matches to all strains of Burkholderia cenocepacia, but still allow matches to organisms such
as Burkholderia dolosa and Burkholderia xenovorans. Genus
level granularity would only allow matches to proteins
from organisms that were not members of genus Burkholderia. A supplemental set of searches was performed for
each genome at each phylogenetic granularity excluding
sequences isolated from phage or viral genomes, to provide additional information.

Filter threshold values were chosen empirically for each
genome as previously described [11], to compensate for
phylogenetic bias in the Genbank nr database. This determination is based on the number of ortholog candidates
found for the most highly conserved query protein (maximum candidate set size) in each genome/phylogenetic
granularity combination. The most highly conserved
query proteins represent a worst-case scenario for possible
misidentification of phylogenetic relatives, as multiple
database matches to unrelated organisms create statistical
noise that can mask the true best match. As filter threshold
size increases and wider BLAST score windows are used,
sudden increases in candidate set size have been found to
correlate with large increases in this statistical noise, [11].
From a practical standpoint, finding the inflection point
in plots of maximum candidate set size versus filter
threshold value provides a simple way to minimize this
noise, which can be easily scaled up to accommodate a
pipeline of hundreds or thousands of genomes.
For the current database, threshold values were selected by
first running the DarkHorse program at six different preset
filter threshold levels (0, 2%, 5%, 10%, 20%, and 40%).
Maximum candidate set size was plotted against each preset filter threshold value to identify the point immediately
below the steepest increase in the slope of the curve, as
illustrated in Figure 1a–c. This point was selected as the
global threshold value used in bitscore window calculations for that genome/keyword combination. Figure 2
shows the distribution of filter threshold values chosen
for all 955 microbial genomes at genus level phylogenetic
granularity. These values vary according to the number of
database relatives available for a particular genome. Filter
threshold values generally fall around 10% for the majority of microbial genomes (e.g. Salinispora tropica, shown in
Figure 1a), but can be as high as 20% for highly represented groups (e.g. Escherichia coli HS, shown in Figure
1b) or as low as 2% for poorly represented groups (e.g.
Borrelia burgdorferi, shown in Figure 1c).
Web search interface
A user-friendly web interface allows users to access both
the DarkHorse HGT Candidate relational database, and
the underlying raw data for individual genomes. The
interface provides simple selection tools for individual
organisms or groups of organisms, as well as continuously
variable LPI score range maxima and minima (Figure 3).
Phylogenetic granularity can be adjusted to target recent
or more ancient HGT events, and to include or exclude
matches to phage genomes.

Advanced search features include selection of entire taxonomic groups by lineage, as well as searches for individual
proteins by annotation keywords or sequence similarity to
user-selected reference proteins by amino acid BLAST

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/419

query. Users can also target proteins having unusual DNA
compositions, based on percent G+C for their underlying
coding sequences.
Web search results include both filtered results, combining all genomes selected, plus separate data for each individual genome (Figure 4). Filtered results can be viewed
online as an html file, or downloaded in tab-delimited
format for import into a spreadsheet program such as
Microsoft Excel. For each individual genome, two different types of information are available, a genome summary
page and a tab-delimited file of raw, unfiltered DarkHorse
results. Genome summary pages, in html format, include
a histogram of genome-wide LPI scores, a scrollable list
showing numbers of matched proteins tallied by species,
and statistics on total number of matched versus
unmatched proteins (Figure 5). The summary page also
includes phylogenetic lineage of the genome, as defined
in the NCBI taxonomy database, and search-specific keywords and/or NCBI taxonomy ID numbers used by the
DarkHorse program to eliminate self-matches to the query
genome.
The Web search engine can be used to select phylogenetically atypical proteins, which are the most likely potential
candidates for horizontal gene transfer, by selecting only
those matches with particularly low LPI scores. Conversely, to find proteins that would be phylogenetically
unlikely as horizontal transfer candidates, a higher LPI
score range can be selected. As a guide to LPI score selection, composite LPI score frequencies for all 955 microbial genomes are shown in Figure 6, using a strain level
granularity setting. Proteins with LPI scores below 0.6 typically have no database matches closer than the phylum or
class level, indicating strong phylogenetic discordance.
LPI scores greater than 0.75 indicate that database
matches can be found in the same phylogenetic family,
suggesting horizontal gene transfer is unlikely to be
detectable by phylogenetic methods. Proteins with intermediate level scores are typically borderline cases, which
may be difficult to interpret on the basis of phylogenetic
evidence alone.
One unique and powerful feature of the DarkHorse HGT
Candidate database is the opportunity to explore the phylogenetic background of potential HGT donors as well as
recipients. The breadth of the database allows not only
query sequences, but also their database match partners to
be evaluated for sequence similarity or novelty compared
to taxonomically related organisms. Although the DarkHorse HGT Candidate database includes LPI calculations
only for genes belonging to publicly available, sequenced
genomes, it currently includes 747,660 entries where LPI
scores are available for both query and match partner.
This LPI score relationship is useful in predicting whether

or not sufficient data will be available to build a full-scale
phylogenetic tree supporting horizontal gene transfer.
A low LPI score for the match partner (potential donor)
means there may be an insufficient number of phylogenetically related sequences in the database to draw any
solid conclusions as to whether or not HGT has actually
occurred. Selecting only those matches with reciprocal LPI
relationships (low LPI query coupled with high LPI match
partner) will lower sensitivity, but can be used to increase
stringency, eliminating HGT candidates that cannot be
easily corroborated using phylogenetic trees.
Based on the LPI score distributions shown in Figure 6, a
combination of query LPI score less than 0.6 with a match
partner (potential donor) LPI score greater than 0.75 is a
reasonable starting place to identify well-supported HGT
candidates. However, optimal cutoff points may vary for
individual genomes, depending on branch lengths of the
phylogenetic trees underlying their lineage descriptions,
as well as phylogenetic distance between available
sequenced genomes. The DarkHorse HGT Candidate web
server therefore allows users to fine-tune LPI search
parameters according to their individual research needs,
for both query and potential donor sequences.
HGT events of different ages can be targeted by choosing
different levels of phylogenetic granularity. Strain level,
the narrowest granularity choice, is most useful for studying relatively recent HGT events, because it can identify
proteins unique to a particular strain but absent from
related strains. Species and genus settings recognize pro-

HGT timescales can be investigated for a particular protein of interest by comparing its LPI scores at several different phylogenetic granularities, trying to find a point
where the score changes from high to low. However, predicting the age of HGT events requires some caution,
because phylogenetically atypical proteins (having low
LPI scores) could occur for two different reasons: either
gene gain by the query organism, or gene loss from its
closest known relatives. In cases where the query organism is the only sequenced example at a particular taxonomic level, whether strain, species, or genus, it may not
be possible determine age of gene acquisition until more
data on related organisms becomes available.
Proteins as well as genomes vary widely in their relative
rates of sequence variability, making automated identification of true orthologs difficult. For this reason, detailed
BLAST match statistics are provided, so that users can evaluate the likelihood of true orthology in more detail for
individual HGT candidates. Statistics provided include
alignment length, percent identity, e-value, and bitscore,
as well as percent of the query protein covered by the
alignment. Search output also includes the number of
non-self database matches falling within the bitscore window for each query. A high number of database matches
is characteristic of conserved proteins that are well represented in database. Unusual or rapidly evolving proteins
will have fewer database matches.
DNA composition statistics, including percent G+C, are
sometimes used as a simple marker of foreign DNA within
a genome, although there may be a wide disparity
between individual genes due to other factors. Users may
wish to use this information as a complement to the phylogenetic evidence provided by DarkHorse. The website
search engine provides the option to display DNA composition statistics if desired. These statistics include percent
G+C for each individual protein coding sequence, as well
as mean and standard deviation for percent G+C of all
coding sequence regions in the parent genome. Alternatively, proteins with unusual G+C content in their coding
sequence DNA can be selected as part of the search process, either by z-score statistics, or by absolute percent G+C.
As an example, a z-score minimum of 1.0 would select
only queries whose G+C content was either higher or
lower than the mean for all coding sequences in the
genome by 1.0 standard deviations.
One type of horizontal gene transfer frequently described
in the literature involves groups of adjacent genes called
pathogenicity islands [19,20]. To explore whether hori-

reference this publication.

The DarkHorse HGT Candidate Resource differs from
these other databases in its size, speed, algorithm used to
identify HGT candidates, and approach to addressing user
queries. Since the DarkHorse algorithm works equally well
with both draft and finished genome sequences, both
types have been incorporated into the database, increasing its size and ability to perform broad, comprehensive
studies that would be impossible using other tools.
Despite the large database size, extensive pre-computation and efficient relational database design allows most
user queries to be completed within seconds to minutes.
It is intended that the DarkHorse HGT Candidate resource
will be updated annually to include newly available
genome sequences.

Conclusion
Broad statistical comparisons of horizontal gene transfer
are needed across a wide diversity of genomes to understand many biological issues that cannot be addressed by
other means. One fundamental unanswered question is
how levels of horizontally acquired genes vary among
organisms, and why? Model organisms with particularly
high or low rates of HGT are needed to identify internal,
genome-specific factors, as well as external, environmental factors that control the extent to which HGT occurs.
These questions are of interest not only within an individual organism or taxonomic group, but also within particular environments, to understand how HGT has
contributed historically to species diversification and
adaptation, and predict how it may influence events in the
future.
In addition to descriptive and mechanistic questions
about frequency and control of HGT, it is important to
understand which protein functions and families are most
often transferred between unrelated organisms. The gene
functions most frequently retained after horizontal transfer are likely to provide a significant selective advantage to
their recipients. Antibiotic resistance is a well known
example of this type, but the scope of our knowledge in
this area is still very limited. The enormous and rapidly
growing reservoir of sequenced microbial genomes could
provide tremendous power answer these types of questions, but has not yet been effectively utilized. A comprehensive, user searchable database like the DarkHorse HGT
Candidate Resource should prove an essential tool for leveraging this invaluable asset.

Availability and requirements
The resource described here is available at http://dark
horse.ucsd.edu. It is provided to academic researchers for
educational, research and non-profit purposes, with no

Authors' contributions
S.P. conceived the idea for the database and wrote the
manuscript and all computer code. T.G. contributed to
software architecture design and provided computational
resources for high throughput data management. E.A.
contributed to the design, scope, and content of the user
interface. All authors read and approved the final manuscript.
