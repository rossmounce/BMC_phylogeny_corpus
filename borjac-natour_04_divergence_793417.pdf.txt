Ssb protein, gp32, RNA-binding proteins, DNA-binding proteinstranslational control, DNA replication

Abstract
The single-strand binding (Ssb) protein of phage T4 (T4 gp32, product of gene 32) is a mRNAspecific autogenous translational repressor, in addition to being a sequence-independent ssDNAbinding protein that participates in phage DNA replication, repair and recombination. It is not clear
how this physiologically essential protein distinguishes between specific RNA and nonspecific
nucleic acid targets. Here, we present phylogenetic evidence suggesting that ssDNA and specific
RNA bind the same gp32 domain and that plasticity of this domain underlies its ability to configure
certain RNA structures for specific binding. We have cloned and characterized gene 32 of phage
RB69, a relative of T4 We observed that RB69 gp32 and T4 gp32 have nearly identical ssDNA
binding domains, but diverge in their C-terminal domains. In T4 gp32, it is known that the Cterminal domain interacts with the ssDNA-binding domain and with other phage-induced proteins.
In translation assays, we show that RB69 gp32 is, like T4 gp32, an autogenous translational
repressor. We also show that the natural mRNA targets (translational operators) for the 2
proteins are diverged in sequence from each other and yet can be repressed by either gp32. Results
of chemical and RNase sensitivity assays indicate that the gp32 mRNA targets from the 2 related
phages have similar structures, but differ in their patterns of contact with the 2 repressors. These
and other observations suggest that a range of gp32-RNA binding specificities may evolve in nature
due to plasticity of the protein-nucleic acid interaction and its response to modulation by the Cterminal domain of this translational repressor.

Introduction
T4 gp32, the single-strand binding (Ssb) protein of bacteriophage T4, is a well studied member of the Ssb protein
family, and was the first such ssDNA-binding replication
protein to be discovered [1]. The protein, product of T4
gene 32, is an essential component of the phage DNA replication complex and also plays essential roles in DNA

repair and recombination [2,3]. Like other Ssb proteins,
T4 gp32 facilitates transactions at the replication fork,
especially along the lagging strand, through its binding to
the unwound DNA template and its specific interactions
with other protein components of the DNA replisome. T4
gp32 is known to stimulate the phage induced DNA
polymerase (T4 gp43) and to play a role in the dynamics

of primosome (T4 gp61-gp41 complex) recruitment by
the primase-helicase assembly protein T4 gp59 [4-6]. In
general, Ssb proteins lack specificity to the ssDNA
sequence and this property allows them to perform their
physiological roles at all genomic locations undergoing
replication, repair or recombination. The presence of a
Ssb protein in the right place at the right time may
depend, in large measure, on specificity of its interactions
with other proteins from the same biological source.
T4 gp32 has the interesting property of being able to control its own biosynthesis at the translational level in vivo.
The protein binds to a specific target (translational operator) in the 5' leader segment of the mRNA from gene 32,
and represses translation of this RNA [7]. Another Ssb protein, gp5 of the M13 ssDNA phage family, has also been
shown to act as a mRNA-specific translational repressor,
although in this case, the RNA target is located in the message for another essential M13 replication protein, gp2
(an endonuclease) [8,9]. It is not known if other Ssb proteins, especially those for cellular DNA replication and
maintenance, also possess RNA binding functions that
regulate specific translation or other physiologically
important RNA-dependent processes. In T4, the physiological link between the sequence-independent ssDNA
and specific RNA binding functions of gp32 has been
explained by a model based on in vitro measurements of
the protein's binding affinities to different nucleic acid ligands. It has been observed that ssDNA is favored over
translational operator RNA as a ligand for T4 gp32 and
that RNA of nonspecific sequence is the least preferred
nucleic-acid ligand for this Ssb protein [10-12]. In vivo, T4
encoded mRNA for gp32 is intrinsically more metabolically stable than the typical prokaryotic mRNA and is
thought to have opportunities to undergo many cycles of
gp32-mediated repression and depression during the replication and other processing of phage DNA. The potential
for translation of this mRNA in the T4 infected E coli host
is thought to be determined by availability of ssDNA in
the metabolic pool [10,13,14]. DNA damage or unwinding transactions are thought to draw gp32 away from its
mRNA target to the exposed ssDNA, thus causing derepression of translation and upward adjustments in gp32.
Repression of the mRNA would then be reestablished if
the amount of gp32 exceeded the number of exposed
ssDNA sites for the protein. This model is consistent with
many in vivo observations relating to levels of T4 gp32 biosynthesis under conditions of DNA damage or abnormal
accumulation of ssDNA in the phage infected bacterial
host [7].
It is not clear how T4 gp32 distinguishes between specific
RNA and the non-specific nucleic acid sequence of ssDNA
or ssRNA ligands. It appears that single-strandedness of
the nucleic acid is not the most important criterion used

http://www.virologyj.com/content/1/1/4

by the protein to selectively bind its own message in the
phage-induced mRNA pool. The translational operator for
T4 gp32 has been mapped by RNA footprinting assays and
determined to consist of two contiguous components, a 5'
terminal ~28-nucleotide component that forms a folded
structure (RNA pseudoknot) and an adjacent, less structured, >40-nucleotide component that lies 3' to the pseudoknot [15,16]. The 3' terminal component includes
several repeats of UUAAA or UAAA sequences, in addition
to harboring typical prokaryotic nucleotide determinants
for translation initiation by ribosomes [7,16,17]. The
RNA pseudoknot and UUAAA/UAAA elements are both
essential for autogenous repression of the mRNA by T4
gp32 [15,16,18]. In vitro studies suggest that the pseudoknot serves as the initial recognition (nucleation) site for
the protein and that this gp32-RNA interaction leads to
cooperative binding of additional gp32 monomers to the
less structured downstream sequence containing the
UUAAA/UAAA elements and ribosome-binding site (RBS)
[16]. Cooperative binding to the mRNA is envisaged to be
analogous to gp32-ssDNA interactions, except that the
UUAAA/UAAA sequence elements probably contribute to
specificity of the mRNA interaction to the protein.
The 3-dimensional structure of intact T4 gp32 has not
been solved, although a number of biochemical and physiological observations have provided clues that the protein is modularly organized into 3 distinct domains [19].
In particular, studies with proteolytic fragments of purified T4 gp32, including the analysis of a crystal structure
for one of these fragments [20], have assigned the ssDNA
binding function to a module formed by an internal segment of the 301-residue protein. It is presumed that this
domain is responsible for binding specific RNA as well,
although no direct evidence exists for this notion. In the
studies described here, we show that the ssDNA-binding
domain is highly conserved between T4 gp32 and the phylogenetic variant of this protein from the T4-like phage
RB69. Yet, we also show that sequences of the mRNA targets for the two Ssb proteins are different and that the two
repressors differ in their patterns of interaction with these
targets. We present results suggesting that specificity of
gp32 to RNA has co-evolved with specificity of this Ssb
protein to other phage induced proteins of DNA metabolism that interact with gp32's C-terminal domain. Our
studies suggest that the ability of a diverging regulatory
RNA to make alternate contacts with a mutually plastic,
but highly conserved, RNA-binding protein site may allow
the RNA to tolerate mutational changes without loss of
the regulatory function. Such plasticity of the interacting
partners could allow for the evolution of a broad spectrum of gp32-RNA binding specificities despite selective
pressures that conserve the amino acid sequence of the
protein's nucleic acid-binding domain.

Methods
Bacterial and phage strains used
The E coli K-12 strain K802 (hsdR, hsdM+, gal, met, supE)
was used as host in cloning experiments and the E coli B
strain NapIV (hsdRk+, hsdMk+, hsdSk+, thi, supo) was the host
for plasmid-mediated gene expression studies that utilized lambda pL control. E coli B strain BL21(DE3), which
harbors a T7 RNA polymerase gene under cellular lac promoter control [21], was used as the host for T7 Φ10-promoter plasmids in pilot experiments that assessed toxicity
of cloned RB69 gene 32 to bacterial cells.
Cloning and nucleotide sequence determination of RB69
gene 32
In preliminary experiments, we used Southern blot analysis of AseI-digested RB69 genomic DNA to identify and
retrieve an ~35-kb DNA fragment that hybridized to a T4
gene 32-specific riboprobe under stringent conditions.
The riboprobe was prepared by methods described previously [22,23] using the T4 gene 32 clone pYS69 [15],
which was generously provided by Y Shamoo. We were
unable to clone this AseI fragment in AseI-compatible Eco
R1-generated ends of plasmid vectors. However, further
digestion of the AseI fragment with ApoI (which generates
Nde1-compatible ends) yielded a shorter, ~15-kb, fragment that could be cloned in the NdeI-EcoRI interval of
vector pNEB193 (cat# N3051S, New England Biolabs,
Beverly, MA). The cloned fragment was sequenced and
found to be very similar to the T4 genetic segment extending from gene 59 through the 5' terminal ~2/3 of gene 32,
except that the RB69-derived DNA appeared to lack a
homologue of the T4 ORF 32.1 (see below). Comparisons
between the T4 and RB69 gene 59-32 regions are diagrammed in Fig 1. We retrieved the remainder (3' terminal
segment) of RB69 gene 32 from RB69 genomic DNA,
through PCR amplification using Taq DNA polymerase.
For this purpose, we utilized two primers, one perfectly
matching a sequence in the cloned AseI-ApoI RB69 fragment
(ie,
upstream
primer:
5'GCTGCTAAGAAATTGTTCATAG3') and the other (the
downstream primer), an 18-mer bearing the sequence
5'CAGCAGCAGTGAAACCTTTA3', was chosen from a
PCR screen of an RB69 primer library. DNA amplification
was carried out under low-stringency conditions for
primer annealing (30 sec at 25°C), which allowed activity
from the imperfectly matched downstream primer. We
obtained several products that we resolved by agarose gel
electrophoresis Only one of these products, an ~35-kb
DNA fragment, hybridized, although poorly, to the T4
gene 32-specific riboprobe initially used for the Southern
blot analysis of Ase1-digested RB69 genomic DNA. This
fragment was sequenced, using the PCR, and found to
contain the 3' terminal segment of RB69 gene 32 as well
as some of the region distal to RB69 gene 32 (relative to
the T4 genetic map). Collectively, sequence analysis of the

http://www.virologyj.com/content/1/1/4

cloned and amplified RB69 genomic segments yielded
sufficient information for designing new primers to
amplify, from genomic DNA, the entire wild-type RB69
gene 32, as well as shorter segments of this gene and its
putative control region in the untranslated RB69 IC59-32
region (Fig 1). DNA sequence information obtained from
these analyses was also used for another study, which was
aimed at determining the sequence of the entire RB69
genome (GenBank NC_004928).
Assays for plasmid directed gene 32 expression
We used the lambda pL plasmid vector pLY965 [24] to
clone RB69 gene 32 sequences that were designated for in
vivo expression studies. This vector expresses cloned DNA
under control of the heat-inducible λcI857pL element,
which produces sufficient cI857 repressor under uninduced conditions (≤30°C) as to maintain pL-mediated
expression at undetectable levels. Minimizing plasmiddriven transcription from pL contributed to stable maintenance of the cloned wild-type RB69 gene 32, the product
of which is highly toxic to bacterial cells. RB69 gene 32
mutants still emerged when such clones were grown at
≤30°C. Some of these mutants were archived for use as
controls in certain studies (eg, PL2 and PL8, Fig 4). With
the T7 Φ10-promoter expression vector pSP72 (Promega)
as the cloning vehicle, clones containing the wild-type
RB69 gene 32 were not viable when introduced into E coli
BL21(DE3), probably because of residual (constitutive)
lac-promoter activity in this bacterial host. To circumvent
potential toxicity, pSP72-based recombinants were propagated in hosts lacking a T7 RNA polymerase gene. The
purified plasmid DNA from these hosts was used for in
vitro transcription and translation assays. Methods for the
radiolabeling of plasmid encoded proteins and their subsequent analysis by SDS-PAGE have been described elsewhere [24,25], and conditions pertaining to specific
experiments are given in figure legends.
Purification of gp32 from clones of the structural gene
RB69 gp32 and T4 gp32 were purified from the overproducing clones pRBg32∆op (RB69 gp32) and pYS69 (T4
gp32), respectively. We used the gp32 purification protocol outlined by Bittner et al, [26] with minor modifications. The preparation of crude extracts, from 6-liter
batches of heat-inducible E coli NapIV clones of phage
genes, was as described previously for T4 RegA protein
[27]. Anionic-exchange chromatography (using Q-Sepharose; Cat# 17-0510-01; Pharmacia) was as described for
purification of plasmid-generated RB69 gp43 [28]. Under
the conditions used, gp32 eluted at 0.3–0.4 M NaCl. In
the subsequent chromatographic step, utilizing PhenylSepharose (Cat#17-0965-05; Pharmacia), we tested column fractions for nuclease contamination by incubating
4 µl samples with plasmid DNA (~1 µg) overnight at
room temperature and then analyzing the mixtures by

agarose gel electrophoresis. The gp32-containing fractions
that exhibited no hydrolysis of the plasmid DNA were
pooled and the protein was purified further by chromatography on ssDNA-agarose (Cat #15906-019; Invitrogen). Pooled fractions from the ssDNA chromatography
were dialyzed against a gp32 storage buffer containing 0.1
M NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM
DTT and 50% glycerol Protein stocks (at 4–8 mg gp32/
ml) were stored at -20°C until used.
Preparation of RNA for in vitro studies
RNA preparations used for footprinting and other in vitro
studies originated from in vitro transcription of pSP72
clones of the desired gene 32 sequences Methods have
been described elsewhere [29]. Phage-specific RNA
sequences of the purified transcription products used for
footprinting included nucleotide positions -102 to +161
(relative to the initiator AUG) in case of the RB69 gene 32
transcripts and positions -96 to +161 in case of the T4
gene 32 transcripts. These products also included a 10-nt
sequence from the plasmid's T7 promoter region RNA
sequencing was carried out by using the RVT-catalyzed
primer-extension (cDNA synthesis) method described

elsewhere [23,29]. Sequencing primers were annealed to
codons 12 to 20 of the transcripts and the sequenced segments of the RNA spanned nucleotide positions +36
through about -100 relative to the initiator AUG. For in
vitro translation assays, the RNA preparations included
full length and truncated versions of the gene 32 openreading frame from each of the 2 phage sources.
Assays for gp32-mediated in vitro translational repression
We used E coli S30 cell-free extracts (Cat#L1020;
Promega) with purified pSP72-based gene 32 recombinant DNA (coupled transcription-translation assays) or
purified RNA (DNA-free translation assays) to assess
repressor activities of purified RB69 gp32 and T4 gp32.
With plasmid-directed gene 32 expression, it was possible
to use expression of the plasmid borne bla gene (β-lactamase) as an internal control. Each 50 µl in vitro assay reaction mixture (placed in a 15-ml conical tube) contained 1
µg of plasmid DNA template or 4 µg RNA, 5 µl of a mixture of all amino acids (1 mM each) except L-methionine,
1 µl of an S30-premix cocktail (containing rNTPs, tRNAs,
an ATP generating system and required salts), 15 µl S30
extract and the balance of volume in nuclease-free water

Results of experiments showing that RB69 gp32 is an autogenous translational repressor
Figure 4
Results of experiments showing that RB69 gp32 is an autogenous translational repressor. For Panel A,
λCI857PLN-bearing plasmid clones of the diagrammed DNA segments were heat-induced (42°C) and assayed for gp32 synthesis as described in other work [24,27]. RBG32 is a DNA segment that carries the wild-type sequence from -120 through +900
relative to the first base of the initiator AUG of RB69 gene 32. RBG32∆op is a truncated derivative of RBG32 that lacks elements of the putative RNA pseudoknot of RB69 gene 32 (Figs 3 & 6). PL8 is identical to RBG32 except that it carries a singlebase substitution (marked with an asterisk) in codon 173, leading to a F173S substitution in RB69 gp32. PL2 is similar to RBG32
and PL8, except that it carries several point mutations (map positions marked with asterisks). Panel B shows results of an
experiment in which purified RB69 gp32 was shown to inhibit in vitro translation of purified mRNA from the cloned RBG32
fragment, as well as mRNA from in vitro expressed plasmid clone (coupled transcription/translation). Conditions for these
assays are described in METHODS.

Reaction mixtures, including any added gp32, were constituted in an ice bath before transferring to 37°C for
incubations (30 or 60 min). Reactions were stopped by
rechilling in the ice bath. Proteins from 5 µl samples were
precipitated with 20 µl acetone, collected by centrifugation, dried and suspended in SDS extraction buffer for
analysis by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Analysis of
plasmid encoded (N-terminal) gp32 fragments was carried out in SDS-PAGE (10% gels) using Tricine as the electrophoresis buffer. This buffer system allows for effective
resolution of small polypeptides [30]. When used, purified gp32 was added at concentrations ranging between 5
and 20 µM.
Treatments of RNA with RNases and chemical agents
The RNA-modifying chemical reagents Dimethylsulfate
(DMS; Cat# D18,630-9; Aldrich) and Diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC; Cat# D5758; Sigma) and the ribonucleases (RNases A1, T1 and V1 respectively) were used to
probe RB69- and T4-derived operator RNAs for intrinsically structured regions. The RNases were also used for
RNA footprinting (protection by gp32) studies.

DMS was diluted in absolute ethanol at ratios of 1:2, 1:4,
and 1:5 ratio v/v and its effects were analyzed at the three
concentrations. The reaction buffer contained 30 mM
HEPES pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2. Reactions were stopped in
0.5 M β-mercaptoethanol and 0.75 M sodium acetate. The
protocol for DEPC treatment was identical to that for
DMS, except that we used 1 µl of DEPC per 100 µl of reaction mix and incubated the reactions at room temperature
for 10 min.
For the RNase-sensitivity assays, including gp32-mediated
RNA footprinting, digestions with RNases A1 and T1 were
carried out in 30 µl buffer containing 60 mM NH4Cl, 10
mM Mg acetate, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, and 6 mM βMercaptoethanol. The buffer for digestions with RNase V1
contained 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.2, 10 mM MgCl2, and 0.2
M NaCl Incubations were at 37°C in 30 µl buffer in all
cases. RNase treatments were halted with an equal volume
of buffer containing 0.4 M Na acetate pH 5.2, 20 mM
EDTA, and 30 µg E coli tRNA. When used for RNA footprinting, RB69 gp32 or T4 gp32 was added at concentrations in the range between 1 µM and 5 µM.

Results
A sequence comparison between T4 gp32 and RB69 gp32
The amino acid sequence of RB69 gp32 was deduced from
the determined nucleotide sequence of the gene. An alignment between the predicted primary structures of this protein and its T4 homologue is shown in Fig 2, which also
highlights the main differences between the 2 proteins
and points out certain functionally important landmarks
on the T4 gp32 sequence. The two proteins are identical at

http://www.virologyj.com/content/1/1/4

~85% of amino-acid positions (92% overall similarity),
with most of the differences being clustered in 2 short
blocks of amino-acid sequence in the highly charged Cterminal segment of the protein, D264(RB69)/A264(T4)
to L299(RB69)/L301(T4). Both C-terminal segments are
rich in serines and aspartates; however, they differ in their
arrangements of these residues and the serine-rich cluster
is 5 residues longer in T4 gp32 (S282-S286). In contrast to
their conspicuous differences in the C-terminal domain,
T4 gp32 and RB69 gp32 are closely similar in segments
that, in T4 gp32, have been implicated in cooperative
gp32-gp32 interactions (95% identity/100% similarity for
the N-terminal 21 residues) and ssDNA binding (residues
21 to 254; ~92% identity/~95% similarity). We note that
all T4 gp32 residues that have been implicated in ssDNA
binding are conserved in RB69 gp32 (Fig 2). However,
interestingly, codon sequences for the two aligned N-terminal gp32 segments differ at many third nucleotide positions between T4 and RB69, suggesting that there has
been natural selection for amino acid identity (and not
merely chemical or side-chain similarity) in the N-terminal two-thirds of the phage Ssb protein. We also note that
both proteins contain 2 "LAST" (3KRKST7 or
110KRKTS114) sequence motifs, which in the T4 system
have been implicated in interactions with the negatively
charged surfaces of DNA as well as with the C-terminal
domain of gp32 [31]. One of these motifs (K3-T7) lies
near the extreme N-terminus of the protein and the second (K110-S114) is adjacent to a short sequence (residues
102–108) that diverges between T4 and RB69 (~50% similarity), but that also contains 3 conserved charged residues including the DNA-binding tyrosine Y106 of T4
gp32 [20].
The RB69 IC59-32 region
Figure 3 shows an alignment of the RB69 IC59-32 region
with its counterpart (the IC32.1-32 region) from T4 The
T4 region (GenBank NC_00866) has been experimentally
documented to harbor the translational operator for gene
32 expression [6]. The RB69 counterpart (GenBank
NC_004928) is 7 nucleotides longer and ~70% identical
in sequence. By comparison, the gp32 encoding portions
of the T4 and RB69 genes are ~80% identical in the overall
nucleotide sequence (see Fig 1 for GenBank accession
numbers) and their predicted protein products are >90%
similar in amino acid sequence. There is an additional 40nt untranslated sequence in the RB69 IC59-32 region that
appears to have no T4 counterpart (Fig 3), and ORF321 is
missing altogether in RB69 (Fig 1). So, it appears that the
regions between genes 59 and 32 of T4 and RB69 have
undergone more evolutionary divergence from each other
than their gp32-encoding regions. However, despite their
differences in nucleotide sequence, the translational operator sequence of T4 gene 32 and its putative RB69 counterpart are predicted, by computer programs, to form

Amino-acid sequence alignments between the Ssb proteins (gp32s) of T4 and RB69. Residues and segments of the
T4 gp32 sequence that have been implicated in specific biological functions of the protein are marked as follows: Db [DNA
binding residue]; Zb (residues that coordinate Zn++ in the zinc-binding domain; [20,46]); gp32-gp32 [residues involved in cooperative gp32 binding to ssDNA]; XLgp59 (residue that cross-links to gp59; [42]); LAST (sequence motifs, (Lys/Arg)3 (Ser/
Thr)2, that have been proposed to directly bind nucleic-acids or mediate gp32-gp32 interactions [31]). The shaded C-terminal
portion of T4 gp32 has been implicated in interactions with other phage induced proteins [38]. The small deletion (∆32PR201)
alters specificity of T4 gp32 in phage replication without affecting autogenous translational repression [39]. The largest vertical
arrows denote trypsin-hypersensitive sites (19) The G-to-A mutation marked "(ts)" was isolated in this laboratory as a missense (temperature-sensitive) suppressor of a defective gp43 function (unpublished). In the RB69 gp32 sequence, residues
whose codons differ from their conserved T4 counterpart at the third nucleotide are underscored with a single dot; those differing by 2 nucleotides are marked by 2 dots.

similar structures. We address this prediction below and
present experimental evidence for the RNA structure and
its role in translational control of RB69 gp32 synthesis.
RB69 gp32 and T4 gp32 are functionally similar
Figure 4 shows results from experiments that measured
the effects of RB69 gp32 on its own synthesis in vivo (Fig
4A) and in vitro (Fig 4B). The in vivo experiments measured plasmid-directed RB69 gene 32 expression by E coli
clones carrying wild-type and mutant versions of the RB69
gene. As shown in Fig 4A, induced expression of the gene
was lower (by ~4-fold) with the wild-type construct than
with deletion mutants of the untranslated 5' leader of the
mRNA (RBG32∆op, Fig 4A) or missense mutants in the
structural gene from this phage (PL2 and PL8 constructs;
Fig 4A). These observations are consistent with the explanation that RB69 gp32, like T4 gp32, is able to bind and
repress its own mRNA. The results shown in Fig 4B confirm that purified RB69 gp32 is a potent repressor of translation of purified mRNA for this protein.

We have used similar experiments to those for Fig 4 to
compare repressor activities of T4 gp32 and RB69 gp32 on
identical RNA targets, and observed that either protein can
repress gene 32-specific mRNA from either source (results
not shown). However, such experiments, which require
10–30 µM purified protein to demonstrate repression (Fig
4B), did not unambiguously distinguish between the
RNA-binding specificities of the 2 proteins. Also, in
phage-plasmid complementation assays, we observed

that the cloned RB69 wild-type gene 32 supported efficient growth of T4 gene 32 mutants (bursts of ~100) By
these criteria, the T4 and RB69 proteins appeared to be
similarly functional in each other's physiological systems.
Yet, the natural targets for the 2 proteins are clearly different from each other in topography (Fig 3) and as we
describe later, RNA-binding specificity differences
between the 2 proteins could be detected through in vitro
RNA-footprinting assays, which utilized lower concentrations of gp32 than is usually required to detect gp32mediated repression by in vitro translational assays.
RNA structure in the RB69 gene 32 translational initiation
region (TIR)
As discussed above for Fig 3, computer-assisted and visual
examinations of the RB69 IC59-32 nucleotide sequence
predicted an RNA topology that was similar to the T4 gene
32 translational operator, particularly with regards to
presence of a putative RNA pseudoknot structure to the 5'
side of the Shine-Dalgarno and UUAAA/UUAA sequence
elements of the mRNA. We used 3 RNA modifying agents
to test directly for intrinsic secondary or higher-order
structure in the RB69-derived RNA: DMS, DEPC and
RNase V1, respectively. Results are shown in Fig 5. We
observed that the RB69-derived sequence from nucleotide
position A(-1) through A(-45), relative to the initiator
AUG, was hypersensitive to cleavage following DMS or
DEPC treatment (Fig 5A) and relatively insensitive to
cleavage by the dsRNA-specific RNase V1 (Fig 5B). These
observations, which are summarized in Fig 6A, are

to be insensitive to DEPC modification (Fig 5A). Below,
we show that another position in this segment, G(-10), is
relatively insensitive to the ssRNA-specific RNase T1. Possibly, cleavage at U(-20) and G(-10) by RNA modifying
agents is affected by RNA hairpin formation in the U(-8)
to A(-21) sequence. The location of this putative hairpin,
which is not predicted in the T4 RNA counterpart, is diagrammed in Fig 6A. In summary, the T4 gene 32 translational operator region and its putative counterpart from
RB69 exhibit several topographical differences from each
other, including an additional 6-nt sequence in RB69 that
may contribute to RNA secondary structure formation in
the RBS. Below, we show that the 2 regions also differ in
their interactions with translational repressors.

consistent with the prediction that the A(-1) to A(-45) segment of the RB69 IC59-32 RNA region is intrinsically
unstructured. In contrast, the segment of this RNA corresponding to the putative pseudoknot structure can
accommodate a range of /RNA sequences. The interaction

The footprints of T4 gp32 and RB69 gp32 on gene 32specific RNA targets from T4 and RB69
We used the ssRNA-specific RNases A1 and T1 to determine the abilities of gp32 from the 2 phage systems to
protect RNA targets from cleavage with these enzymes.
These RNA footprinting studies also extended the information we obtained from treatments with DMS and
DEPC about intrinsic structure of the RNA targets. Results
are shown in Fig 7 for the RB69-derived RNA target and
Fig 8 for the T4-derived target. Also, a summary of our
observations from these experiments is presented on the
RNA sequence charts in Fig 6B In the aggregate, our studies showed that T4 gp32 and RB69 gp32 contact RNA targets differently from each other, although the two
proteins overlap in their RNA-binding properties. We
highlight the following specific observations.

1. At the protein concentrations used (1–5 µM), the RB69
gp32 footprint on the RNA target from RB69 was 5 residues longer than the footprint of this protein on the T4derived RNA target; however, the positions of the 2 footprints relative to the respective initiator AUG and 5' terminal boundary of the pseudoknot structure appeared to be
identical (Fig 6)
2. As can be seen in Figs 7A and 7B, RB69 gp32 protected
its own mRNA target strongly within the nucleotide segment between U(-14) and G(-61), and weakly in the
segment from U(-2) to G(-9) In contrast, as seen in Figs
7C and 7D, T4 gp32 protected this RNA strongly only in
the segment from C(-42) to G(-61)
3. As can be seen in Fig 8C and 8D, T4 gp32 protected the
T4-derived RNA strongly in the G(+3) to U(-70) segment
In contrast, RB69 gp32 protected this RNA target best in
the U(-16) to U(-70) segment (Fig 7A and 7B)
It should be noted that the gp32 footprint sizes reported
here are shorter than has been reported in studies that utilized higher concentrations of T4 gp32 with T4-specific

RNA targets [16,32]. As stated earlier in this report (Fig 4),
the higher gp32 concentrations (>5 µM) mask specificity
differences between the T4 and RB69 proteins.

Discussion
Phages T4 and RB69 are phylogenetically related to each
other and encode homologous sets of DNA replication
proteins that exhibit a significant degree of compatibility
with each other's biological systems [22,24]. Despite such

overlaps in function, we have commonly observed specificity differences between protein homologues from the 2
phage systems. For example, in plasmid-phage complementation assays, RB69 DNA polymerase (gp43) was
observed to be just as effective as T4 gp43 in T4 DNA replication in vivo, whereas the T4 enzyme was less effective
than its RB69 counterpart for RB69 DNA replication
[22,33]. Also, the 2 DNA polymerases, like the 2 Ssb proteins compared here, are RNA-binding autogenous

translational repressors that differ in RNA binding specificity and RNA target sequence. Studies with the T4 versions of gp43 and gp32 clearly show that the binding of
these proteins to specific RNA is mutually exclusive with
their binding to DNA [7,34]. So, conservation of the translational functions of these proteins may be related to conservation of their replication functions. Based on previous
studies with RB69 gp43 [35], as well as the current study
with RB69 gp32, we surmise that neither of these translational repressors possesses a domain that binds RNA
exclusively. Rather, in both cases, the RNA binding site
seems to be contained within the region of the protein
that binds DNA. Thus, it is possible that in phage infected
cells, specific RNA serves as a regulator of both the biosynthesis and replicative activities of these proteins.
In the purified system we have used to compare RNA footprints for gp32 from T4 and RB69 (Figs 6, 7, 8), we

observed that the same RNA target could exhibit different
patterns of protection depending on source of the Ssb protein. This observation suggests that the RNA-protein interaction is intrinsically flexible and can accommodate a
range of RNA sequences as long as these sequences can be
made to assume a certain configuration. In addition, the
interaction could be subject to modulation by intra- and
intermolecular protein-protein interactions of the
repressor. In this regard, it is known that the extreme Nterminal segment (~20 residues) and C-terminal segment
(~100 residues) of T4 gp32 have profound effects on the
ssDNA binding activity, which is housed in the region
bracketed by these 2 segments of the protein [19,36,37].
The N-terminal segment determines cooperative binding
to ssDNA (through gp32-gp32 interactions) and the C-terminal segment has been implicated in interactions of
gp32 with other phage induced proteins [38]. Possibly,
the observed sequence divergence between the C-terminal

for a summary.

domains of T4 gp32 and RB69 gp32 (Fig 2) was in part
coupled to divergence of the mRNA targets during evolution of the 2 related translational repressors.
Although we cannot rule out the possibility that the C-terminal domain of gp32 influences specificity to RNA by
interacting directly with this ligand, there are indications
that this negatively charged segment of gp32 is a modulator of gp32 interactions with nucleic acids rather than a
carrier of nucleic acid binding determinants. In particular,
a small deletion that maps within this protein segment
(∆32PR201; Fig 2) exhibits altered specificity to other proteins but has no effects on autogenous control of gp32
synthesis in vivo [39]. Also, recent studies with purified
RB69 gp32 implicated the C-terminal domain of this
protein in regulating access of gp43 from the same phage
to binding sites in the ssDNA-binding module of the Ssb
protein [40]. It has also been shown that in T4, the
ssDNA-binding module of gp32 forms specific crosslinks

to gp59, the phage-induced primase-helicase loading
protein [41,42]. Such observations suggest that the 2
nucleic-acid binding functions of gp32 may be subject to
regulation by a combination of intra- and intermolecular
protein-protein interactions involving the divergenceprone C-terminal domain. It would be particularly
interesting to find out if the gp32 sequence divergence
near the DNA binding residue Y106 (Fig 2) is important
for RNA recognition. X-ray crystallographic studies [20]
suggest that T4 gp32 residues T101-K110 constitute part
of the ssDNA-binding surface of the protein, which
includes Y84, Y99, Y106 and the nearby "LAST" motif
(residues 110–114; 31). Also, as suggested by the 3D
structure, these residues are located within or very close to
the Zn-binding domain of the protein; ie, the putative
"zinc-finger" sequence Cys77-X3-His-X5-Cys-X2-Cys90,
which has counterparts in a number of RNA-binding proteins [40]. The construction and analysis of RB69-T4 gp32
chimeras could help to establish if the divergence near

Virology Journal 2004, 1:4

Y106 is responsible for the observed differences in RNA
footprints between T4gp32 and RB69 gp32 (Figs 6, 7, 8).
In summary, we envisage that as a mediator of gp32's
interactions with other phage induced proteins, the C-terminal domain of gp32 may co-diverge with its protein targets to maintain mutual recognition, and that structural
plasticity of a conserved ssDNA-binding domain may
allow an also diverging RNA target to establish rearranged
contacts within a relatively conserved protein pocket. It is
unclear if the 2 sets of divergence are interconnected, but
together, they could facilitate the evolution of a high
degree of diversity in how the synthesis and/or replication
activity of this Ssb protein is regulated among phylogenetic relatives of T4. It will be important to find out if this
diversity includes RNA ligands for gp32 that control the
DNA-binding activity but not synthesis of gp32, or if
autogenous translational repression has been replaced by
other mechanisms for control of gene 32 in some T4 relatives. There is at least one reported example where evolution resulted in lack of RNA binding function in the Ssb
protein of an M13-like phage [43]. Also, a scan of available genomic sequences for T4-like phages http://
phage.bioc.tulane.edu/ reveals a high degree of sequence
divergence in the putative translational operator regions
of the corresponding gene 32 regions. In one case, phage
RB49 (GenBank NC_005066), it has been reported that
there are no indications that an RNA pseudoknot structure
exists in the putative TIR for gene 32, although the UUAA/
UUAAA sequence units are conserved in the RB49 IC59-32
region [44]. It remains to be seen if gp32 from this and
other T4 like phages that appear to lack the RNA
pseudoknot do bind their respective TIR regions or repress
their own translation.
Finally, we should comment about ORF32.1 (Fig 1) and
its possible relevance to evolution of the mRNA target for
gp32. This ORF is present in some T4-like genomes (eg T4
and GenBank Ac No AF033323) and absent in others (eg,
RB69 and GenBank Ac No AY310907). Recently, it was
shown that T4 ORF 32.1 encodes a Seg-type (G1Y-YIG
family) homing endonuclease (now named SegG) that
mediates its own transfer, along with T4 gene 32, to the
ORF32.1-less genome of phage T2 in T4 × T2 genetic
crosses. We note that the 5' terminal sequence of the RNA
pseudoknot for T4 gp32 translational control overlaps the
reading frame of the segG gene, in addition to being very
similar (~83% identity) to the corresponding segment of
the pseudoknot sequence of RB69, which lacks a segG
gene (Fig 3). Possibly, this portion of the RNA pseudoknot preexisted the entry of an ORF32.1-like sequence element into the gene 59-32 intercistronic region of a T4
progenitor and that the modern day segG gene (ORF32.1)
may be a chimera consisting of an extension of the parental segG reading frame into the recipient genome's pseu-

doknot sequence. Such lateral transfer events and
subsequent mutation may have profound influences on
evolution of the RNA binding functions of proteins that
have relaxed sequence but stringent structural requirements for their RNA target.
