Abstract
Background: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) can be classified into nine genotypes (A-I) defined by sequence divergence of
more than 8% based on the complete genome. This study aims to identify the genotypic distribution of HBV in 40
HBsAg-positive patients from Rondônia, Brazil. A fragment of 1306 bp partially comprising surface and polymerase
overlapping genes was amplified by PCR. Amplified DNA was purified and sequenced. Amplified DNA was purified
and sequenced on an ABI PRISM® 377 Automatic Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The
obtained sequences were aligned with reference sequences obtained from the GenBank using Clustal X software
and then edited with Se-Al software. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted by the Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) approach using BEAST v.1.5.3.
Results: The subgenotypes distribution was A1 (37.1%), D3 (22.8%), F2a (20.0%), D4 (17.1%) and D2 (2.8%).
Conclusions: These results for the first HBV genotypic characterization in Rondônia state are consistent with other
studies in Brazil, showing the presence of several HBV genotypes that reflects the mixed origin of the population,
involving descendants from Native Americans, Europeans, and Africans.

Background
Human hepatitis B virus (HBV), which is the prototype
member of the family Hepadnaviridae, is a circular, partially double stranded DNA virus of approximately 3200
nt [1]. This highly compact genome contains four major
open reading frames encoding the envelope (preS1, preS2
and surface antigen - HBsAg), polymerase (HBPol) and X
(HBx) proteins [2]. HBV infection is a relevant global
health problem, with 2 billion people infected worldwide,
including 350 million of them suffering from chronic
HBV infection. HBV infection results in 500,000 to 1.2
million deaths per year caused by chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma and is the 10th leading cause of death worldwide [3]. The mechanisms for
persistent HBV infection are not fully understood, but
they seem to involve several aspects, including genetic
components [4]. The role of genetics components of the
virus and the host in the natural history of hepatitis B

including HBV genotypes and subgenotypes; basal core
promoter and pre core mutations; HBV DNA serum
levels and co-infection with other viruses (particularly
hepatitis C and human immunodefficiency viruses) have
been recently reviewed [5].
HBV has been classified into nine different genotypes,
designated from A to I [6], they that represent genetically
stable viral populations that share a common, separate
evolutionary history. They emerged in specific human
populations and migrated with their hosts to other areas
in the world, leading to their present geographical distribution [7]. Genotype A is distributed globally and is the
main genotype found in Europe, North America, Africa
and India. Genotypes B and C are predominant in East
and Southeast Asia [8]. Genotype D is mainly found in
the Middle East and Mediterranean countries but it has
been reported globally, whereas genotype E seems to be
predominant in western-sub-Saharan Africa [9,10]. HBV/
E has not been found outside Africa, except for a few
rare cases mostly in individuals with an African background. Nevertheless, it was recently reported the presence of this genotype in a specific community in
Colombia [11] and in the north of India [12]. Genotype

G has been characterized in samples from USA, Mexico
and France and appears primarily to be present as a coinfection with another HBV genotypes, most commonly
genotype A. Genotypes F and H are found almost exclusively in Central and South America [13,14]. Recently,
HBV genotype I was described in northwestern China,
Vietnam and Laos [6,15,16].
Most genotypes have been divided into subgenotypes
with distinct virological and epidemiological properties.
In addition, recombination among HBV genotypes
increases the viral variability itself [17].
Genotype A is subdivided into seven subgenotypes
(A1 to A7) [18,19]. Isolates belonging to subgroup A1
have been mostly identified in African populations and
their descendants [20-22]. Subgenotype A2 is mainly
found among Europeans, whereas subgenotype A3 has
been identified in Central and West Africa [23,24]. Subgenotype A4 was reported in Gambia [18,22] and subgenotype A5 was reported in Nigeria and among African
descendants in Haiti [25]. Subgenotype A6 includes
strains from African-Belgian patients from Congo and
Rwanda [26] and A7 was found in Rwanda and Cameroon [19].
Genotype D was previously divided in 4 subgenotypes
(D1 - D4) [27] found in different continents, spreading
particularly around the Mediterranean Basin to the
Asian continent. New subgenotypes, D5 to D7 were
later described in India [28], Indonesia [29], and in the
Mediterranean Basin [30], respectively.
Genotypes E and G are not subdivided in subgenotypes [31,32]. Genotypes F and H are the ‘’New World’’
genotypes found in indigenous populations from Alaska
to Central and South America. Genotype F is divided
into 4 subgenotypes: F1-F4. Subgenotypes F1 and F2
have been further divided in F1a, F1b, F2a and F2b
[14,33-35]. Genotype H is very closely related to genotype F and was initially thought to be a clade of genotype F [13,36].
The state of Rondônia is located in the Southwest of
Brazilian Amazon and borders with other Brazilian
states (Mato Grosso - East, Amazonas - North, Acre West) and Bolivia (West and South). Currently, it is not
clear the general prevalence of HBV in Rondônia state.
Katsuragawa et al., [37] found frequencies of 44.5% for
anti-HBc and 6.7% for HBsAg studying the serologic
markers of hepatitis B and C among the inhabitants of
the upper Madeira river, between the localities of Santo
Antonio and Abunã, in the Municipality of Porto Velho,
Rondônia.
In the last Brazilian census, carried out in 2000, there
were 1,380,952 inhabitants in Rondônia State, with the
following ethnic background: European-descendants 588,568 (42.62%); African-descendants - 63,452 (4.59%);
Asian-descendants - 3,094 (0.22%); mixed - 698,309

(50.56%); Indigenous people - 10,683 (0.77%); not
known - 16,846 (1.22%) [38].
The aims of the present study were to characterize the
HBV genotypes circulating in Rondônia state, Brazil, and
to infer about their origin using phylogenetical analyses
approaches.

Methods
This study was carried out in the state of Rondônia, Brazil (Figure 1) and included 40 serum samples from
patients chronically infected with HBV. Of these
40 patients, 26 (65%) were asymptomatic and 27 (67.5%)
did not have liver cirrhosis. All samples are HBsAg positive for at least six months, but only 26 (65%) of them
were also HBeAg positive, as previously determined by
routine serological assays during patients follow up.
Patients had between 18 and 60 years old (mean age: 30
years); sex distribution was 28 (69%) men and 12 (31%)
women and all of them were under medical assistance at
the Research Center for Tropical Medicine (CEPEM), in
Rondônia. Indigenous people patients, pregnant women
and patients with other associated chronic diseases were
excluded from the present analysis.
For the viral DNA extraction from 200 μl serum, it
was used QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany)
according to the manufacturer’s standards. The precipitated DNA was resuspended in 200 μl of elution buffer
and stored at -20°C until use.
To avoid false-positive results, strict procedures proposed for nucleic acid amplification diagnostic techniques were followed [39]. Samples were first amplified
with primers previously described [40] in order to get a
416 base pairs (bp) fragment partially covering the
HBsAg coding region (S). A fragment of 1306 bp partially comprising HBsAg and Polymerase coding regions
(S/POL) was then amplified from the samples that had
been positive in the previous step [13].
Amplified DNA was purified using ChargeSwitch®
PCR Clean-Up kit (Invitrogen, São Paulo, Brazil).
Sequencing was performed in an ABI Prism® 377 Automatic Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,
USA) [41] using dideoxy nucleoside triphosphates
(ddNTPs) containing fluorescent markers (Big Dye® Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).
The quality of each electropherogram was evaluated
using the Phred-Phrap software [42,43] and consensus
sequences were obtained by alignment of both
sequenced strands using CAP3 software available at the
web page Eletropherogram quality analysis http://asparagin.cenargen.embrapa.br/phph/.
Initially, sequences obtained in this study were genotyped by phylogenetic reconstructions using reference
sequences from each HBV genotype obtained from the

GenBank (n = 383) (data available upon request). These
sequences comprising partial HBsAg and Polymerase
coding regions (S/POL) were aligned using Clustal X
software [44] and edited in the SE-AL software (available at http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/seal/). For the
phylogenetic analysis, the missing nucleotides were
coded as “missing characters” in nexus block. Bayesian
phylogenetic analyses were through by Markov Chain
Monte Carlo simulation implemented in BEAST v.1.5.3
[45] ten million generations were sufficient to obtain the
convergence of parameters. The analyses were performed under relaxed uncorrelated lognormal molecular
clock using the model of nucleotide substitution (GTR
+G+I) obtained previously by Modeltest v3.7 [46]. The
maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree was obtained

from summarizing the 10,000 substitution trees and
then it was removed 10% of burn-in using Tree Annotator v.1.5.3 [45].

Results and Discussion
PCR for the S/POL region (1306 bp) was performed in
all the 40 samples and 35 of them showed positive
results (Figure 2). The HBV genotypes distribution
found was: A (37.1%), D (42.8%), F (20.0%), while up to
the subgenotype level we found A1 (37.1%), D3 (22.8%),
F2a (20.0%), D4 (17.1%) and D2 (2.8%). Sequences were
deposed in the GenBank at accession numbers:
HM101096 - HM101130.
HBV/A1 samples from Rondônia state did not cluster together in a single group in the phylogenetic tree

and only few sequences remained close to previously
reported Brazilian sequences. Subgenotypes D3 and
F2a showed the same pattern. These results suggest
that probably several different entries of these HBV
subgenotypes occurred in this state. On the other
hand, genotype D4 sequences clustered in a single
group. Nevertheless, as there are few reported
sequences from this subgenotype [25,47,48], it was not
possible to robustly infer the entry pattern for this
subgenotype.
This is the first study reporting the HBV genotypes in
Rondônia state, Brazil. A molecular characterization of
HBV sequences is important in establishing the evolutionary origins and patterns for viral dispersal. Several
reports previously determined the preponderance of
genotypes A, D and F in South America [40,49-53]. This
finding agrees with the origins of Brazilian population,
which is a mixture of European-descendants, Indigenous
people and African-descendants.
Previous studies have shown that genotype A was the
most frequent in different Brazilian populations
[21,40,53-55]. Recently, this genotype was found in 75%
patients from Rio de Janeiro [56]. Most of these cases
belonged to subgenotype A1, which is the same that was
detected in Rondônia. Genotype A was also found among
HBV carriers in the state of Acre, which borders the state
of Rondônia, in 25 (73.5%) of 34 HBV carriers [57].
Subgenotype A1 was related to the presence of isolated communities of African-descendants, as recently
reported in Mato Grosso do Sul State, Central Brazil
[58]. It is estimated that about 3.5 million Africans
arrived in Brazil in the period between 1551 and 1850
[59]. Currently, there are over 1,000 communities officially identified as remnants of Quilombo, the Brazilian
name for small isolated communities made from runaway-slaves where their descendants lived in communities since the slavery period [58,60]. Most of the
African-descendants currently living in Rondônia came
for the construction of the Madeira-Mamoré Railway, a
hallmark in Rondônia state history, that was built by
many African-descendants workers in the beginning of
twentieth century. Most of them had come from the
Caribbean Barbados in a different context from most of
the slaves that came directly from Africa [61]. Studies
analyzing HBV genotypes in Barbados should be carried
to allow a better comparison among Rondônia and Barbados circulating virus. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, as the different sequences from Rondônia are
interspersed in the tree and clustered together with
other Brazilian sequences (that mostly come from Rio
de Janeiro State), as well as with Haitians sequences in
another branch, we suggest that subgenotype A1 had
different entries in Rondônia, i.e., different viruses were
the founders of this population.

Genotype D predominates in the Mediterranean area
[62]. Subgenotype D1 occurs mostly in the Mediterranean basin and Middle East. D2 has been reported in
India, Japan, Europe and the United States [63]. D3 was
found in South Africa, Brazil, Rwanda, Costa Rica and
the United States. Finally, D4 was reported in Australia,
South Africa, Somalia, Rwanda and Oceania [27,47,48].
In this study, genotype D was prevalent (42.8%) and its
subgenotypes were D2, D3 and D4. Since the number of
sequences obtained for each HBV/D subgenotype found
in Rondônia was small, it was not possible to infer
about the origin for each one.
In all the three states located in Southern Brazil, HBV
genotype D was previously detected: Paraná [64], Santa
Catarina [65] and Rio Grande do Sul [66]. Genotype D is
the most frequent in Southern Brazil, whereas genotype A
is the most frequent in all other regions [67,68]. In Italy,
genotype D is largely the most frequent and is found in 73
to 80% of the patients infected with HBV [69,70]. The Italian government claimed that there are 25 million Brazilians of Italian ancestry, which would comprise the largest
population with Italian background outside Italy. During
the last quarter of the nineteenth century, several Italians
were stimulated to migrate to Brazil and other countries,
such as Argentina and the United States. Italians migrants
settled down mostly in Southeast (São Paulo state) and
South Brazil (Paraná, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do
Sul states). South Region inhabitants latter migrate to
Center West and Amazon states, including Rondônia. A
deeper characterization of hepatitis B virus genotypes
found in Southern Brazil is needed to better understand
the migration of hepatitis B virus genotypes in Brazil, particularly for genotype D.
Genotype F is the most divergent and considered indigenous in the Americas. Mello et al. [55] showed that
genotype F had a low prevalence in Brazil. All genotype F
sequences here described belonged to subgenotype F2a,
that it is the same that is found in other Brazilian and
Venezuelan studies [14,55]. This probably is related to
the important native American background in Rondônia
population.

Conclusions
In conclusion, genotypes A, D and F found in Rondônia
reflecting the ethnic background of its inhabitants, i.e.,
mainly descendants from European colonizers, African
slaves, and indigenous people. Further studies should be
carried out to investigate the clinical, virological and therapeutical response characteristics of HBV genotypes, using
a large number of samples, including patients representing
Rondônia State population with clinical data to characterize their HBV status (carrier, immunotolerancy, acute and
chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular
carcinoma).
