Abstract
Background: Members of the CD36 scavenger receptor family have been implicated as sensors of microbial
products that mediate phagocytosis and inflammation in response to a broad range of pathogens. We investigated
the role of CD36 in host response to mycobacterial infection.
Methods: Experimental Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) infection in Cd36+/+ and Cd36-/- mice,
and in vitro co-cultivation of M. tuberculosis, BCG and M. marinum with Cd36+/+ and Cd36-/-murine macrophages.
Results: Using an in vivo model of BCG infection in Cd36+/+ and Cd36-/- mice, we found that mycobacterial burden
in liver and spleen is reduced (83% lower peak splenic colony forming units, p < 0.001), as well as the density of
granulomas, and circulating tumor necrosis factor (TNF) levels in Cd36-/- animals. Intracellular growth of all three
mycobacterial species was reduced in Cd36-/- relative to wild type Cd36+/+ macrophages in vitro. This difference
was not attributable to alterations in mycobacterial uptake, macrophage viability, rate of macrophage apoptosis,
production of reactive oxygen and/or nitrogen species, TNF or interleukin-10. Using an in vitro model designed to
recapitulate cellular events implicated in mycobacterial infection and dissemination in vivo (i.e., phagocytosis of
apoptotic macrophages containing mycobacteria), we demonstrated reduced recovery of viable mycobacteria
within Cd36-/- macrophages.
Conclusions: Together, these data indicate that CD36 deficiency confers resistance to mycobacterial infection. This
observation is best explained by reduced intracellular survival of mycobacteria in the Cd36-/- macrophage and a
role for CD36 in the cellular events involved in granuloma formation that promote early bacterial expansion and
dissemination.

Background
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) infects an estimated
2 billion people worldwide and is responsible for the
most deaths annually (1.6 million/year) of any single bacterial pathogen [1]. However, only 5 to 7% of infected
immunocompetent individuals develop disease during
their lifetime [2], demonstrating the critical role of host
factors in the control of M. tb. The histological hallmark
of tuberculosis is the granuloma, composed of an inner
core of activated macrophages primed for intracellular
killing by surrounding T-lymphocytes [2]. Cellular
dynamics within the granuloma foster interactions
between the innate and adaptive immune systems [3],

but granuloma formation may also promote bacterial
expansion and dissemination during initial stages of
tuberculosis infection [4]. Recent work using quantitative
intravital imaging of early granuloma formation in zebrafish embryos has demonstrated that macrophages internalizing mycobacteria undergo apoptosis and are
phagocytosed by previously uninfected macrophages
recruited to the granuloma, which then become infected.
Granuloma formation may therefore promote mycobacterial infection by allowing for intracellular persistence
and expansion of bacteria as well as systemic dissemination through egress of infected cells to generate new
granulomas [4]. Thus, macrophages play a central role in
host-pathogen interactions during tuberculosis, acting as
both the primary phagocytic line of defense against
M. tb as well as the intracellular niche for bacterial
replication.

Alterations in macrophage function have been implicated as risk factors for mycobacterial infection, including defects in NADPH oxidase [5,6], the interleukin
(IL)-12-interferon (IFN)-g axis [7-10], natural resistanceassociated macrophage protein-1 (NRAMP1) [11,12], and
the vitamin D receptor [13]. However, variability in host
susceptibility to tuberculosis is not fully explained by
alterations in these molecular determinants, and other
host factors are likely to play an important role [14,15].
Model systems using both M. bovis Bacillus CalmetteGuérin (BCG) and M. marinum have been extensively
used to study the pathogenesis and immunology of
tuberculosis, each of which has its advantages and limitations [16]. Murine infection with M. bovis BCG is a wellestablished experimental model system of disseminated
tuberculosis [3,17,18]. Mice of the BCG-sensitive C57BL/
6 genetic background serve as permissive hosts for mycobacteria and develop systemic infection following inoculation via the intraperitoneal route [3,17]. Mycobacterial
replication occurs in multiple organs and is ultimately
controlled by adaptive host immune responses [19],
mimicking the course of primary human tuberculosis.
M. marinum, a relatively rapidly growing mycobacterial
species, is a close genetic relative of M. tuberculosis [20]
that has been used to study the pathogenesis of tuberculosis [4,21-23]. M. marinum causes systemic granulomatous disease in ectotherms such as frogs and fish and
peripheral granulomatous disease (fishtank granulomas)
in humans [24]. M. marinum shares genetic determinants
of pathogenicity with M. tuberculosis, such as the ESX-1/
RD1 locus, which induces recruitment of new macrophages to nascent granulomas [4,25], and modulates phagolysosome maturation and the intracellular fate of
mycobacteria [26,27]. As such, M. marinum has provided
valuable insights into tuberculous disease using in vivo
and in vitro model systems. We used BCG in vivo and
BCG, M. marinum, and M. tb in vitro to model aspects
of tuberculosis in order to dissect the role of CD36 in
disease pathogenesis.
The cell surface glycoprotein CD36, present in many cell
types including macrophages, has been implicated in a
variety of cellular processes including fatty acid transport,
regulation of angiogenesis, atherosclerosis, inflammation,
and as a pattern recognition receptor mediating innate
immune responses to a range of pathogens, including
mycobacteria [28]. CD36 belongs to the class B scavenger
receptor family, a group of phylogenetically conserved
molecules involved in sensing a variety of microbial products and endogenous ligands. CD36 plays a physiological
role in the recognition and clearance of apoptotic cells by
professional phagocytes [29]. CD36 also acts as a co-receptor with the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2/6 complex that
binds diacylglycerides, such as lipoteichoic acids, and

participates in innate sensing and the phagocytic clearance
of Staphylococcus aureus [30,31]. Compared to wild type
(Cd36+/+) mice, CD36-deficient (Cd36-/-) mice are more
susceptible to experimental S. aureus infection, exhibiting
higher mortality, increased levels of bacteremia, and multiple renal and cardiac abscesses [30]. CD36 participates in
the uptake of and inflammatory response to other bacterial
species including Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis
in model cell systems in vitro [32]. CD36 contributes to
macrophage-mediated clearance of Plasmodium falciparum parasitized erythrocytes [33,34], and CD36 deficiency is associated with a dysregulated cytokine response
and increased mortality in experimental animal models of
severe malaria [33].
Recently, a genome-wide RNA interference screen of
Drosophila melanogaster macrophage-like cells identified
the CD36 homologue Peste (Pes) and the related mammalian class B scavenger receptors as important factors
in the uptake of mycobacteria [35]. Furthermore, reversible alterations in the expression of CD36 on peripheral
monocytes/macrophages have been observed in patients
with active tuberculosis [36]. Based on the hypothesis
that CD36 deficiency may alter host susceptibility to
tuberculosis, we examined the role of CD36 in mycobacterial infection in vitro and in an experimental model in
vivo. We show that Cd36-/- mice have decreased mycobacterial burdens and reduced granulomatous responses
after challenge with BCG. Furthermore, macrophages
deficient in CD36 restrict the growth of multiple mycobacterial species in vitro. Taken together, our results suggest that CD36 deficiency confers relative protection
against mycobacterial infection.

Methods
Mice strains and mycobacteria isolates

Cd36-/-, Tlr2-/-, Tlr4-/-, and Irak4-/- and wild type control (Cd36+/+) C57BL/6 mice were bred and kept in the
animal facility at the University of Toronto. Animal protocols were approved by the Animal Care Committee of
the University of Toronto, and all experiments involving
animals were performed in compliance with current
University of Toronto guidelines. Mice 8-12 wk of age
were used in all experiments. M. tb strain H37Rv (TMC
no. 102), M. bovis BCG-Pasteur strain, and Mycobacterium marinum type strain 1218R (ATCC 927) were routinely grown at 30°C or 37°C in Middlebrook 7H9 broth
(BD Biosciences; Franklin Lakes, NJ USA) supplemented
with 0.2% glycerol and 10% OADC (Oleic Acid, Albumin, Dextrose, Catalase; BD Bioscience; Franklin Lakes,
NJ USA) or on Middlebrook 7H11 agar (BD Biosciences) supplemented with 0.5% glycerol and 10%
OADC. Infections in experimental animals were
initiated by intraperitoneal injection of 1.5×107 BCG.

Determination of mycobacterial density in infected mice

At different points during infection, mice were euthanized by CO2 inhalation and spleens, livers and lungs
were collected from infected mice. Half of each organ
was homogenized and plated on 7H11 agar (BD Biosciences; Franklin Lakes, NJ USA), and incubated for
21 days at 37°C for BCG colony counts.
Histopathologic examination

After collection of spleens, livers and lungs from
infected mice, half of each organ was preserved in 10%
formalin, embedded in paraffin and processed in 5 μm
sections. Sections were stained with H&E for histopathology and with Ziehl-Neelsen stain for acid-fast
bacilli.
Intracellular survival of mycobacteria in murine
macrophages

Thioglycolate-elicited macrophages from Cd36 +/+ and
Cd36-/- mice were seeded in 12-well polystyrene plates
(300,000 cells/well) and allowed to adhere for 24 hr.
They were then co-incubated with mycobacteria at a
MOI of 10:1 (M. tb), 10:1 (M. bovis BCG) or 1:1 (M.
marinum) for 3 hr. Cells were washed and incubated in
medium containing gentamicin (RPMI 1640, with 10%
fetal bovine serum, and 2.5 mg/L gentamicin) at 37°C
for M. tb and M. bovis BCG, or at 30°C for M. marinum. At different times (1, 3, 5 or 7 days) after infections, cell lysates of macrophages were prepared and
plated on 7H11 medium (BD Biosciences; Franklin
Lakes, NJ USA) and bacterial colonies were counted
after incubation at 37°C for 21 days (M. tb and M. bovis
BCG) or at 30°C for 7 days (M. marinum).
Uptake of mycobacteria by macrophages

Differentially labeled intracellular and extracellular mycobacteria were imaged using fluorescent confocal microscopy following phagocytosis by wild type (Cd36+/+) and
Cd36 -/- murine macrophages. Thioglycolate-elicited
macrophages from Cd36 +/+ and Cd36 -/- mice were
seeded on glass cover slips at a density of 125,000 cells
per cover slip. M. marinum was incubated for 10 minutes
with sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido) hexanoate (NHSLC-Biotin, Thermo Fisher Scientific; Rockford, IL) at pH
8.0 in order to biotinylate the bacterial surface. Biotinylated M. marinum was then co-incubated with murine
macrophages for 3 hr at a multiplicity of infection (MOI)
of 100:1. Extracellular M. marinum were labeled using
streptavidin-conjugated tetramethylrhodamine (streptavidin-TMR, Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA). Macrophages were
fixed and permeabilized (4% paraformaldehyde for
20 min followed by 0.1% Triton X-100 in 5% milk for
20 min) and intracellular M. marinum were labeled with
a second fluorophore, streptavidin-conjugated Alexa

Page 3 of 17

Fluor(c) 488 (Invitrogen). Images were obtained using
spinning disk confocal microscopy (Zeiss Axiovert 200
equipped with a Hamamatsu Orca AG CCD camera and
spinning disk confocal scan head, Volocity acquisition
software). Control conditions included non-biotinylated
M. marinum (negative control for fluorescent labeling)
and 10 μM cytochalasin D (Calbiochem, Gibbstown, NJ)
to inhibit phagocytosis [37].
Internalization of M. marinum by wild type (Cd36+/+)
and Cd36-/- murine macrophages was quantified with a
flow cytometric technique. Biotinylated M. marinum
(MOI = 100:1) was co-incubated with murine macrophages in suspension at a concentration of 106 cells/ml
in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum for 3 hr.
Extracellular mycobacteria were labeled with streptavidin-conjugated allophyco-cyanin (eBioscience; San
Diego, CA), cells were fixed and permeabilized according to manufacturer’s protocol using BD CytoFix/CytoPerm™ (BD Biosciences; Franklin Lakes, NJ USA), and
intracellular M. marinum was labeled with streptavidinconjugated Alexa Fluor(c) 488 (Invitrogen). Flow cytometric analysis was performed using FACSCalibur (BD
Biosciences; Franklin Lakes, NJ USA) acquired with
CellQuest (BD, San Jose, CA) software and analysed
with FlowJo 8.7.3 (Tree Star Inc., Ashland, OR).
Quantitative measurement of viable internalized
mycobacteria was performed in vitro following 3 hr coincubation of bacteria and macrophages, allowing for
phagocytosis without significant intracellular replication.
Thioglycolate-elicited macrophages from Cd36 +/+ and
Cd36-/- mice were plated and co-incubated with mycobacteria at MOI of 100:1 for 3 hr. Extracellular mycobacteria and non-adherent macrophages were removed
by repeated washing (3 times) with media containing
gentamicin (2.5 mg/l) and remaining intracellular mycobacteria were harvested by scraping and lysis using 1%
Triton X-100 (Sigma; St. Louis, MO). Cell lysate was
plated for mycobacterial counts as described above.
Electron microscopy

Cd36 +/+ and Cd36 -/- thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal
macrophages were plated on glass coverslips, then incubated with M. marinum (MOI 100:1) for 6 hr at 37°C.
Cells were washed and fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde,
postfixed in osmium tetroxide, dehydrated with alcohol,
and embedded in epoxy resin. Ultrathin sections were
stained with uranyl acetate-lead citrate, then examined
with a FEI Tecnai 20 transmission electron microscope
with EDX, Gatan image filter, and 1 k by 1 k digital
camera.
Cell viability

Cd36+/+ and Cd36-/- peritoneal macrophages were plated
in 96-well polystyrene plates (50,000 cells/well), and

Hawkes et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2010, 10:299
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/10/299

co-incubated with mycobacteria as above. After incubation
for 1, 3, 5 or 7 days, 10% (v/v) MTS reagent (CellTitre 96
(r) AQueous One Solution Assay, Promega; Madison, WI)
was added directly to culture wells, incubated for 2 hours,
and the absorbance measured at 490 nm.
Apoptosis assay

Fragmented DNA of apoptotic cells was end-labeled by
a modified TUNEL assay (DeadEnd(tm) Colorimetric
TUNEL system, Promega; Madison, WI) according to
manufacturer’s instructions and nuclei of apoptotic cells
were identified on the basis of their darkly stained
pyknotic nuclei. Caspase-3 activity was determined in
cultures of macrophages co-incubated with mycobacteria according to manufacturer’s instructions (Colorimetric CaspACE(tm) Assay, Promega; Madison, WI).
Genetic polymorphisms in the vicinity of Nramp1

Genomic DNA was isolated from macrophages of Cd36+/+
and Cd36-/- using column purification according to manufacturer’ instructions (QIAamp DNA blood mini kit, Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Five markers in the vicinity of Nramp1
(D1Mcg2, D1Mcg3, D1Mcg5, D1Mit19, D1Mit23) [38]
were tested in Cd36+/+, Cd36-/- mice (C57BL/6 genetic
background) and in two reference strains (C57BL/6, BCG
sensitive; and 129/Sv, BCG resistant). Four markers were
polymorphic between the reference strains and all
4 showed that Cd36 +/+ and Cd36 -/- mice carried the
C57BL/6 alleles.
Production of reactive nitrogen and reactive oxygen
intermediates

The Griess reaction (Griess Reagent System, Promega;
Madison, WI) was used according to manufacturer’s
instructions to quantify the nitrite concentration in the
supernatant of thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal macrophages (plated at a density of 200,000 cells per well in
96-well plates) co-incubated with mycobacterial (MOI =
10:1). Nitrite is a stable, non-volatile breakdown product
of nitric oxide (NO), produced by activated macrophages as a mechanism for intracellular killing of
mycobacteria.
Oxidative burst was assessed using a chemiluminescence assay. Adherent macrophages (200,000 per well in
opaque 96-well plates) were stimulated with BCG (MOI
= 100:1), 10 μM phorbol myristate acetate (PMA, Sigma;
St. Louis, MO), or media alone in the presence of 100
μM luminol (Sigma; St. Louis, MO). Chemiluminescence
was detected using a MonoLight 2010C luminometer
(Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA).
Measurement of cytokine production

Blood was collected from euthanized mice by cardiac
puncture, allowed to clot, and cleared by centrifugation.

Page 4 of 17

Serum was stored at -80°C and later assayed for cytokines using a cytometric bead array assay (Mouse
Inflammation Kit, BD Biosciences) according to manufacturer’s instructions.
For assays of cytokine production in vitro, macrophages
were plated in 96 well plates at a density of 200,000 cells/
well. Cells were washed, pre-incubated with IFN-g (10
ng/mL) for 24 hours, then co-incubated with M. marinum or BCG over a time course of infection, at various
multiplicities of infection. TNF and IL-10 concentrations
in the culture supernatant were determined by commercial ELISA according to manufacturer’s instructions
(eBiosciences; San Diego, CA).
In vitro model of cellular events in granuloma formation

Thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal macrophages from
Cd36+/+ and Cd36-/- mice were seeded in 6-well polystyrene plates (1×106 cells/well) and allowed to adhere
for 24 hr. Macrophages were then co-incubated with
M. marinum (MOI = 10:1) for 3 hr at 37°C, and washed
three times to eliminate extracellular bacteria. Cells
were incubated overnight in RPMI 1640 and gentamicin
(2.5 mg/l) to induce apoptosis by serum starvation. Control macrophages were incubated in RPMI 1640 and
gentamicin (2.5 mg/l) with 10% fetal bovine serum.
Apoptosis was confirmed by elevated capase-3/7 activity
[39], determined using a commercially available kit
according to manufacturer’s instructions (Apo-ONE
Homogeneous Caspase-3/7 Assay, Promega). Apoptotic
cells containing mycobacteria were scraped and coincubated with fresh macrophages, plated at a density of
1×106 cells/well in 6-well plates for 3 hr at 37°C. Macrophages were washed three times with media containing
gentamicin (2.5 mg/l) to eliminate extracellular apoptotic cells and bacteria. Macrophages were then harvested
by scraping and lysis using 1% TrotonX-100 (Sigma).
Cell lysate was plated for mycobacterial counts as
described above.

Results
Cd36-/- mice restrict mycobacterial growth relative to wild
type (Cd36+/+) mice

Based on observations implicating class B scavenger
receptors in the uptake of Mycobacterium fortuitum
[35], we hypothesized that disruption of the Cd36 gene
would result in an altered host response to mycobacterial infection. To test this, we experimentally infected
Cd36 -/- and Cd36 +/+ mice with M. bovis BCG and
examined the burden of mycobacteria and histopathology over the course of infection. All mice survived BCG
infection. Consistent with previous reports [17,40], we
observed an initial rise in the BCG counts in the spleen,
reaching a local maximum at 2-3 weeks after infection,
with subsequent continuous decline over 9 weeks of

Hawkes et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2010, 10:299

infection (Figure 1). Of note, Cd36 -/- mice had lower
BCG CFU counts in the spleen overall (p < 0.001) and
at the peak of infection (day 14 post infection; mean ±
SEM 5.4 ± 1.1×104 vs 3.3 ± 0.5×10 5 CFU; 83% lower;
p < 0.001, Figure 1A and 1D). Differences in total spleen
bacillary load were attributable to both relative splenomegaly (i.e., greater average spleen weight, p < 0.001), as
well as a higher density of BCG per gram of splenic tissue (p = 0.02) in Cd36 +/+ mice compared to Cd36 -/mice. Significantly lower bacillary loads at peak (day 14)
were observed in the livers of infected mice (p = 0.005),
with a similar trend in the lungs (p = 0.054). Consistently, mice with higher mycobacterial counts in the
spleen had correspondingly higher counts in the liver
(Spearman’s r = 0.818, p < 0.001).
On histopathological examination, there were fewer
granulomas in the livers of Cd36 -/- mice compared to
the Cd36+/+ mice (Figure 2A and 1B), but the microarchitecture of the granulomas appeared unchanged
(Figure 2C and 2D). In addition, fewer acid-fast bacilli
were visible in splenic tissue sections of Cd36-/- mice
(Figure 2E and 2F), consistent with the lower BCG
bacillary loads observed in Cd36-/- mice. Quantitative
assessment of liver sections demonstrated a 68% reduction in cross-sectional granuloma density in Cd36 -/mice (median 116 (range 46 to 124) vs 359 (239 to 489)
granulomas/cm2; p = 0.029; Figure 2G).
Cd36-/- macrophages restrict mycobacterial growth
in vitro relative to Cd36+/+ macrophages

The macrophage plays a central role in host defense
against M. tb, and several molecular determinants of
host susceptibility to mycobacterial infection involve
alterations in macrophage function [41]. In order to
examine the mechanisms by which Cd36-/- mice restrict

Page 5 of 17

mycobacterial infection, we exposed peritoneal macrophages derived from Cd36-/- and Cd36+/+ mice to M. tb
in vitro. After infection with M. tb, intracellular mycobacterial counts progressively increased over 7 days,
with fewer M. tb inside Cd36-/- macrophages than Cd36
+/+
macrophages (p < 0.0001, Figure 3A). Mycobacterial
counts were also lower overall in Cd36-/- compared to
Cd36 +/+ macrophages infected with M. marinum (p <
0.0001, Figure 3B) and BCG (p < 0.0001, data not
shown). Because the intracellular growth restriction pattern of M. marinum was similar to M. tb, we used
M. marinum as a model organism in subsequent
in vitro experiments, replicating our findings with BCG
where feasible.
Mycobacterial internalization is similar in Cd36-/- and
Cd36+/+ macrophages

Previously, the CD36 homologue Peste (Pes) in D. melanogaster as well as mammalian class B scavenger receptors have been implicated in the uptake of M. fortuitum
[35]. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that differences
in the initial uptake of mycobacteria by macrophages
might account for the differences observed in the mycobacterial bacterial loads following in vitro infection.
However, using several experimental approaches including confocal fluorescent microscopy, flow cytometry,
in vitro co-cultivation, and electron microscopy, we
found no significant difference in uptake of mycobacteria by Cd36-/- and Cd36+/+ murine macrophages.
Using differential labeling of biotinylated intracellular
and extracellular M. marinum with distinct streptavidinconjugated fluorophores before and after cell permeabilization (see Methods section), we qualitatively observed
that Cd36 +/+ and Cd36 -/- macrophages internalize
M. marinum to a similar extent (Figure 4A-F). Image

Figure 1 Cd36-/-mice have lower bacillary burden relative to Cd36+/+ controls after challenge with M. bovis BCG. A. Intraperitoneal
infection (day 0) with BCG (1.5×107 organisms) resulted in a rise in mycobacterial counts in the spleens of Cd36+/+(wild type) mice to a
maximum at day 14 with subsequent decline. The mycobacterial counts in Cd36-/- mice (white box, dashed line) were lower overall (p < 0.001),
and at specific time points (day 7, *p < 0.01; day 14, *p < 0.001). B and C. Differences between genotypes were less pronounced in the liver (B)
and lung (C). Results are displayed as mean ± SEM, with 8 mice per group at each time point, representing two pooled independent
experiments.

analysis (Figure 4G and 4H) and flow cytometric analysis
(Figure 4I and 4J) both showed that the uptake of M. marinum was quantitatively similar between Cd36 +/+ and
Cd36-/- murine macrophages.
Next, viable intracellular mycobacteria were enumerated
after 3 hours incubation with macrophages and after
repeated washing with media containing gentamicin to
eliminate extracellular mycobacteria. Using three mycobacterial species, M. tb, M. bovis BCG and M. marinum, we
found no significant difference in the mycobacterial counts
between Cd36-/- and Cd36+/+ macrophages (Figure 4K),

indicating that uptake of mycobacteria was similar in the
presence or absence of CD36. We exposed macrophages to
different inocula of M. tb and again observed no difference
between Cd36-/- and Cd36+/+ macrophages in the uptake
of mycobacteria at various multiplicities of infection (MOI)
(Figure 4L). Experiments with M. tb at MOI = 10:1 were
repeated four times to confirm this observation.
Finally, Cd36 +/+ and Cd36 -/- macrophages were coincubated with M. marinum (MOI = 100:1) for 6 hr and
visualized by electron microscopy. Numerous electrondense bacilli were evident within cells of either genotype,

peritoneal macrophages resulted in lower mycobacterial loads in cultures of Cd36-/- macrophages (white box, dashed line) compared with wild
type controls (black box, solid line). A. Infection with M. tuberculosis (MOI = 10:1) produced a progressive rise in mycobacterial counts over 7
days, with significant difference (p < 0.0001) between groups. B. Similar results were seen after infection with the rapidly growing M. marinum

(0-93) vs 17 (0-81); p = 0.19) between Cd36 +/+ and
Cd36-/- macrophages.
Cell viability and rate of apoptosis of Cd36-/- and Cd36+/+
macrophages are similar

CD36 has been implicated in macrophage apoptosis
[36,42], which may be an important host defense strategy
for the containment of intracellular mycobacteria [43,44],
and for subsequent priming of adaptive immune effector
cells [45]. Therefore, we investigated whether an
increased rate of apoptosis in Cd36-/- macrophages might
explain the lower mycobacterial counts in these cells. By
terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end
labeling (TUNEL) assay, we found no differences in
apoptosis between Cd36 -/- and Cd36 +/+ macrophages
after 7 days of co-cultivation with M. tb or BCG (data
not shown). Similarly, no difference was observed in caspase-3 activity between cultures of Cd36-/- and Cd36+/+
macrophages co-incubated with M. tb or BCG (data not
shown). Furthermore, examination of spleen and liver tissue sections from in vivo infection experiments with BCG
did not reveal any differences in the density of apoptotic
cells (data not shown).
We also examined if there were differences in viability of
infected Cd36 -/- macrophages compared to Cd36 +/+ ,
which could account for the observed lower mycobacterial

counts in cultures of Cd36-/- macrophages. Viability of
macrophages, as determined by quantitative MTS assay,
was equivalent over 7 days after infection with M. tb
between Cd36-/- and Cd36+/+ macrophages (p = 0.578;
data not shown).
Production of reactive nitrogen and reactive oxygen
intermediates is similar in Cd36+/+ and Cd36-/macrophages

The production of reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNI)
and reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) are effective
intracellular killing mechanisms against microbial pathogens including mycobacteria [46,47]. We examined
whether differences in nitric oxide production and/or
oxidative burst in response to infection with mycobacteria might account for the restriction of mycobacterial
growth in Cd36-/- macrophages. Nitrite concentration
was similar in the supernatant of interferon-g (IFN-g)
activated Cd36+/+ and Cd36-/- macrophages stimulated
with BCG for 24 hours (Figure 6A). Consistent with
previous reports [48-50], nitric oxide production in
response to mycobacterial challenge was toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)- and interleukin-1 receptor-associated
kinase 4 (IRAK-4)-dependent, but TLR4-independent in
our experimental system (Figure 6A). Nitric oxide production in response to live and heat-killed BCG and
M. marinum, as well as TLR2 and TLR4 specific ligands,
was similar in Cd36 +/+ and Cd36 -/- (but not Tlr2 -/- )
macrophages (Figure 6B) and followed similar kinetics
in both cell types (Figure 6C and 6D). Oxidative burst

uptake was observed at different multiplicities of infection with M. tuberculosis (p > 0.05 for each MOI).

(Figure 6E and 6F), as previously described [51,52].

Differences in mycobacterial susceptibility are not
explained by polymorphisms of Nramp1

Because polymorphisms in the Nramp1 gene are known to
affect host susceptibility to mycobacterial infection [53],
we analyzed genomic DNA from Cd36 +/+ and Cd36-/-

Hawkes et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2010, 10:299
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/10/299

mice for polymorphisms at this genetic locus. Comparing
to C57BL/6 (BCG-sensitive) and 129/Sv (BCG-resistant)
controls, both Cd36+/+ and Cd36-/- mice were found to
carry characteristic C57BL/6 alleles (data not shown).
Therefore, differences in mycobacterial susceptibility
between the Cd36+/+ and Cd36-/- mice do not appear to
be attributable to variation in the Nramp1 gene.
Levels of TNF correlate with bacillary burden

TH1 cytokine responses are critical for granuloma formation and control of mycobacterial infection [2], with
TNF playing a central role [41]. We examined levels of
TNF, IFN-g, IL-10, IL-6, IL-12p70 and MCP-1 in the
sera of mice infected with BCG to determine whether
differential cytokine responses could explain the reduced
BCG loads in Cd36-/- mice. TNF concentrations rose to
a maximum 2-3 weeks after infection and subsequently
decreased (Figure 7A), in parallel with BCG counts in
the spleen and liver. Cd36-/- mice had lower TNF levels
overall (p < 0.001). TNF levels were positively correlated
with the BCG counts in the spleen (r = 0.596, p <
0.001, Figure 7B). Although it might be predicted that
higher levels of TH1 cytokines would be associated with
improved control of mycobacterial infection, Cd36 -/mice exhibited lower levels of TNF, which in turn correlated with lower mycobacterial loads in infected organs.
Rather than determining the course of infection, TNF
levels appear to reflect the burden of infected macrophages in our mouse model.
In support of this explanation, we observed similar
levels of TNF in the supernatant of Cd36+/+ and Cd36-/thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal macrophages infected
with mycobacteria in vitro (Figure 7C), which increased
in a dose-dependent manner with increasing multiplicity
of infection with both M. marinum (Figure 7E) and
BCG (Figure 7F). These findings were replicated with
bone-marrow derived murine macrophages (data not
shown). In contrast, TNF production was reduced in
Tlr2-/- and Irak4-/- macrophages compared to their wild
type counterparts (Figure 7C).
Altered IL-10 production does not account for enhanced
antimycobacterial defenses in Cd36-/- mice and
macrophages

IL-10 is an immunomodulatory cytokine, known to inhibit macrophage antimycobacterial activity in vitro [54]
and in vivo [55], as exemplified by the enhanced clearance of mycobacteria in IL-10 deficient mice [56-58].
Mycobacteria and their products, including the glycolipid AraLAM, induce IL-10 production by macrophages
[59]. IL-10 production by macrophages in response to
apoptotic cells is mediated by CD36 to a large extent
[29,60]. Therefore, we hypothesized that the enhanced
antimycobacterial activity of Cd36-/- macrophages may

Page 11 of 17

be related to reduced production of IL-10. However, we
observed significantly higher levels of IL-10 by Cd36-/macrophages over a time course of infection (Figure 7D)
and over a range of multiplicities of infection with both
M. marinum (Figure 7G) and BCG (Figure 7H). This
finding was replicated using both thioglycolate-elicited
peritoneal macrophages (Figure 7D, G and 7H) and
bone-marrow derived macrophages (data not shown). In
contrast, IL-10 production by Tlr2-/- and Irak4-/- macrophages was significantly reduced (Figure 7D). Furthermore, no difference in IL-10 levels was detected in the
sera of Cd36-/- mice relative to wild type controls over
the course of experimental BCG infection (data not
shown). Therefore, improved mycobacterial defenses in
Cd36-/- mice do not appear to be attributable to reduced
production of IL-10 by macrophages.
Additionally, there were no significant differences
observed in serum IFN-g, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70 and
MCP-1 levels in Cd36-/- vs Cd36+/+ mice up to 63 days
after infection (data not shown).
Reduced recovery of viable mycobacteria from Cd36-/macrophages using an in vitro model of cellular events
involved in granuloma formation

Based on studies using quantitative intravital imaging in
transparent zebrafish infected with M. marinum, macrophage turnover within the granuloma contributes to
early mycobacterial growth and dissemination [4]. Arriving macrophages efficiently find and phagocytose
infected macrophages undergoing apoptosis, leading to
expansion of infected macrophages and bacterial numbers [4]. Given the role of CD36 in the uptake of apoptotic cells by macrophages [29], this observation may
account for the decreased mycobacteria loads observed
in Cd36-/-mice. We therefore designed an in vitro system to recapitulate the cellular events of M. marinum
internalization, apoptosis of infected macrophages, and
phagocytosis by secondary uninfected macrophages.
Peritoneal macrophages from Cd36+/+ or Cd36-/- mice
were plated and infected with M. marinum (MOI =
10:1). Apoptosis of the infected macrophages was
induced by serum starvation, as demonstrated by elevated caspase-3/7 activity [39] (data not shown). Then,
the infected apoptotic “prey” macrophages were gently
scraped and co-incubated with healthy uninfected “predator” macrophages. After incubation at 37°C for 3 hr
to allow internalization of prey macrophages, cells were
carefully washed to remove extracellular apoptotic
bodies and bacteria. Cells were lysed and plated on
mycobacterial culture media for CFU counts. The fraction of viable mycobacteria recovered was reduced in
Cd36 -/- compared to Cd36 +/+ predator macrophages
(p = 0.0026; Figure 8). These observations are consistent
with the known role of CD36 as a receptor for apoptotic

Figure 7 Alterations in TNF and IL-10 production do not explain relative resistance of Cd36-/- mice to mycobacterial infection. A. Serum
levels of TNF in Cd36+/+ and Cd36-/- mice rose after intraperitoneal infection (day 0) with M. bovis BCG, reaching a maximum after 14-21 days,
then decreased. This trend paralleled the mycobacterial counts in organs of infected mice. TNF levels were higher overall (p < 0.001) in Cd36+/+
mice (solid line) compared to Cd36-/- mice (dashed line). Results are displayed as mean ± SEM, with each point representing 4 replicate mice.
Data from one representative experiment of two are shown. B. Significant correlation (r = 0.596, p < 0.001) between splenic mycobacterial

Irak4-/- (p < 0.0001) macrophages is markedly deficient. D. Cd36-/- macrophages are not deficient in IL-10 production, and produce higher levels
of IL-10 at some time points (* p = 0.040) following infection with M. marinum. E and F. TNF production in response to M. marinum (E) and BCG
(F) is similar (p = 0.54 for M. marinum, p = 0.96 for BCG) between Cd36+/+ and Cd36-/- macrophages over a range of multiplicities of infection. G
and H. IL-10 production in response to M. marinum (G) and BCG (H) was dose-dependent (p < 0.0001 for both) and was higher in Cd36-/macrophages (p < 0.0001 for M. marinum, p = 0.0003 for BCG). Cytokine levels were assayed in supernatant of macrophages in 96-well plates
(200,000 adherent cells and 250 μl media per well) after 24 hours incubation. These findings were confirmed using bone-marrow derived
macrophages (data not shown).

cell uptake on phagocytic cells [29], together with their
bacterial contents. Collectively, these results suggest that
CD36 participates in granuloma turnover, and contributes to the expansion of the intracellular mycobacterial
pool.

Discussion
Host genetic factors play a major role in influencing the
severity and the ultimate outcome of tuberculosis. In
this study, we have identified CD36 as a potentially
important determinant of host susceptibility to mycobacterial infection. We demonstrated that CD36 deficiency confers relative resistance to mycobacterial
infection. This conclusion was supported by both in vivo
experimental model infections and in vitro cell culture
infection approaches.
We used a well-established murine model of disseminated mycobacterial infection and demonstrated that
disruption of the Cd36 gene confers an altered susceptibility phenotype. In this experimental murine model,
systemic BCG infection is ultimately controlled with the
induction of antigen-specific immunity, similar to
human tuberculosis [17,40,48]. In our studies, M. bovis
BCG counts in the spleens and livers of infected mice
rose to a maximum after 2 weeks, and subsequently

Figure 8 Recovery of viable intracellular mycobacteria is
reduced in Cd36-/- macrophages in an in vitro model
recapitulating cellular events in early granuloma formation.
Primary “prey” macrophages were incubated with M. marinum and
washed to remove extracellular bacteria. Apoptosis was induced by
overnight serum starvation, and was evidenced by increased
caspase-3/7 activity (data not shown). Control macrophages (no
apoptosis) were incubated in media containing 10% fetal bovine
serum. Apoptotic primary prey macrophages containing M.
marinum were gently scraped and co-incubated with uninfected
secondary “predator” macrophages to allow phagocytosis of primary
prey macrophages. After washing to remove extracellular apoptotic
bodies and bacteria, cells were scraped and plated on mycobacteria
culture media for CFU counts. The recovery of viable M. marinum
was reduced in systems using Cd36-/- (white bar) relative to Cd36+/+
(black bar) macrophages (*p = 0.0026), suggesting a defect in the
uptake of mycobacteria-laden apoptotic macrophages.

declined to nearly undetectable levels with the induction
of adaptive immunity (Figure 1). Splenomegaly and
granulomatous infiltrates in the spleen and liver have
been previously described in murine M. bovis BCG
infection [19], as observed in our experiments (Figure
2). We used three species of mycobacteria (M. tb, M.
marinum and BCG) for in vitro experiments in order to
model distinct aspects of tuberculosis pathogenesis and
demonstrate the generalizability of these findings. In
addition to sharing many known virulence factors with
M. tb, M. marinum showed growth restriction similar to
M. tb within Cd36-/- macrophages (Figure 3), and was
therefore used in subsequent assays as a model organism. M. marinum offers several technical advantages
including a rapid growth rate and minimal biohazard
risk. Where feasible, we replicated our findings with
BCG to demonstrate generalizability across different
mycobacterial species. However, because BCG forms
large aggregates when cultured in vitro [61], it was not
suitable for all experiments, particularly imaging studies
which required suspensions of single organisms.
Disruption of the Cd36 gene affected the early and
peak mycobacterial burdens, but did not appear to
impact the ultimate clearance of the organism (Figure 1),
consistent with the role of CD36 as a receptor predominantly functioning in innate immunity [62]. Likewise, a
recent study demonstrated a limited role for CD36 in
controlling the outcome of M. tuberculosis pulmonary
infection, with no survival difference and a modest effect
on lung mycobacterial loads and granulomas only
observed at early time points following intranasal challenge [63]. Further evidence of intact adaptive immune
mechanisms includes the universal survival of Cd36-/mice, and the microscopic structure of granulomas,
which were morphologically normal albeit reduced in
number, commensurate with the reduced mycobacterial
loads observed in these mice (Figure 2). As a macrophage
cell surface receptor involved in the uptake of apoptotic
cells [29], CD36 may participate in the cellular dynamics
within the granuloma. Recent landmark studies have
shown that mycobacteria promote and exploit granuloma
formation for the establishment of infection [4]. After
internalization of mycobacteria, macrophages undergo
apoptosis, and are phagocytosed by newly recruited
macrophages followed by egress of these cells to seed
new granulomas [4]. We modeled this process in vitro
and found reduced recovery of viable intracellular M.
marinum from Cd36-/- macrophages exposed to apoptotic macrophages containing mycobacteria (Figure 8).
These data link our in vivo findings with recent insights
into tuberculosis pathogenesis, suggesting that CD36 may
play a role in the cellular events co-opted by mycobacteria during the establishment and dissemination of
infection.

Hawkes et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2010, 10:299

Consistent with results of in vivo studies, cell culture
infection experiments demonstrated that CD36 deficiency limits intracellular replication of mycobacteria in
macrophages (Figure 3). The mechanism underlying the
restricted replication of mycobacteria in Cd36-/- mice or
macrophages is presently unclear; nevertheless, we have
excluded differences in early mycobacterial uptake,
macrophage cell viability or apoptosis, production of
reactive nitrogen and oxygen species, Nramp1 gene, and
selected cytokine responses among possible explanations. Our finding that CD36 was not required for
mycobacterial internalization was similar to one recent
report involving BCG uptake by murine peritoneal
macrophages [63], but contrasts with an earlier study
that implicated the Drosophila homologue of CD36 in
M. fortuitum uptake [35]. Of note, however, transfection
of murine Cd36 into HEK293 cells did not enhance
uptake of M. fortuitum in the latter study [35], consistent with our and others’ findings using murine macrophages [63]. Another possibility is that inherent
differences in the properties of the mycobacterial species
used in the earlier and the current studies may account
for this discrepancy.
The restricted growth of mycobacteria within Cd36-/macrophages might be explained by impairment of
mycobacterial immune evasion strategies that take
advantage of CD36. Detailed structural studies of the
mycobacterial cell wall lipomannans (LMs) have demonstrated that diacylated LMs inhibit LPS-induced inflammation by murine macrophages [64]. Intriguingly, CD36
is a sensor of diacylglycerides [31] from a broad range
of pathogens [30,33,65] and may be the host receptor
through which diacylated LMs suppress macrophage
function. Alternatively, this observation may be
explained by participation of CD36 in Toll-like receptor
signaling. CD36 is known to associate with the TLR2/6
heterodimer on the cell surface [30,31], and may participate in TLR2-dependent immunosuppressive signaling
pathways in the context of mycobacterial infection
[66-69]. In our experiments, nitric oxide, TNF and IL10 production in response to mycobacteria were TLR2
dependent; however, CD36 did not appear to participate
in these processes. Nonetheless, a role for CD36 in
other TLR2 mediated mycobacterial evasion mechanisms cannot be excluded.
Alterations in cytokine profile did not appear to
explain CD36-mediated differences in mycobacterial
control in vivo and in vitro. Reduced TNF in the sera of
infected Cd36 -/- mice around the peak of infection
appears to reflect the reduced mycobacterial stimulus
rather than acting as a mediator of antimycobacterial
defenses. In vitro, TNF production in response to live
BCG and M. marinum was no different between Cd36-/and Cd36+/+ macrophages, consistent with one previous

Page 14 of 17

report [63]. Other TH1 cytokines, IFN-g and IL-12, were
not significantly different in BCG-infected Cd36-/- and
Cd36+/+ mice. Likewise, anti-inflammatory IL-10 levels
were not significantly different in vivo, and were
increased in vitro in Cd36-/- murine macrophages prestimulated with IFN-g. We speculate that the latter finding may suggest a role for CD36 in the previously
described IFN-g inhibition of TLR2-induced IL-10
expression in the context of mycobacterial infection
[70]. However, elevated levels of IL-10 do not appear to
explain the reduced mycobacterial counts in Cd36 -/macrophages, given the known inhibitory role of IL-10
on mycobacterial control [55,58].
Our observations that deficiency of CD36 reduces the
susceptibility of mice in vivo and of murine macrophages in vitro to mycobacterial infection are novel and
somewhat unexpected, given the roles of CD36 in host
defense against pathogens such as S. aureus and other
bacteria [30,32], as well as P. falciparum [33]. Although
the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear
and require further investigation, our study nevertheless
suggests a unique role of CD36 in host susceptibility to
tuberculosis. Within this context, it is interesting to
note that a CD36-/- genotype occurs with relatively high
frequency in African, Japanese and other Asian populations [71,72], although the evolutionary advantage of
this putative balanced polymorphism is unknown. First
described in patients refractory to platelet transfusion
[73], this genotype has subsequently been associated
with susceptibility to a variety of metabolic diseases
[74]. Recent population and family-based studies have
not associated CD36 gene polymorphisms with severe
malaria phenotypes and it has been suggested that
CD36 deficiency alleles may be maintained in human
populations through selection pressure via a prevalent
infection other than malaria [75,76]. If our observations
are subsequently confirmed in human infection, it is
conceivable that M. tb, being highly prevalent and virulent, could in part account for the persistence of CD36
deficiency in populations from tuberculosis-endemic
regions.

Conclusions
In summary, our findings indicate a novel role for CD36
in host response to mycobacterial infection and suggest
that future population-based studies to examine the
relationship between CD36 deficiency and susceptibility
to tuberculosis would be of interest.
