Abstract
Background: Recent advances in the accumulation of genetic mapping and DNA sequence
information from several salmonid species support the long standing view of an autopolyploid origin
of these fishes (i.e., 4R). However, the paralogy relationships of the chromosomal segments
descendent from earlier polyploidization events (i.e., 2R/3R) largely remain unknown, mainly due
to an unbalanced pseudogenization of paralogous genes that were once resident on the ancient
duplicated segments. Inter-specific conserved noncoding elements (CNE) might hold the key in
identifying these regions, if they are associated with arrays of genes that have been highly conserved
in syntenic blocks through evolution. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the chromosomal
positions of subset of CNE in the rainbow trout genome using a comparative genomic framework.
Results: Through a genome wide analysis, we selected 41 pairs of adjacent CNE located on various
chromosomes in zebrafish and obtained their intervening, less conserved, sequence information
from rainbow trout. We identified 56 distinct fragments corresponding to about 150 Kbp of
sequence data that were localized to 67 different chromosomal regions in the rainbow trout
genome. The genomic positions of many duplicated CNE provided additional support for some
previously suggested homeologies in this species. Additionally, we now propose 40 new potential
paralogous affinities by analyzing the variation in the segregation patterns of some multi-copy CNE
along with the synteny association comparison using several model vertebrates. Some of these
regions appear to carry signatures of the 1R, 2R or 3R duplications. A subset of these CNE markers
also demonstrated high utility in identifying homologous chromosomal segments in the genomes of
Atlantic salmon and Arctic charr.
Conclusion: CNE seem to be more efficacious than coding sequences in providing insights into
the ancient paralogous affinities within the vertebrate genomes. Such a feature makes these
elements extremely attractive for comparative genomics studies, as they can be treated as 'anchor'
markers to investigate the association of distally located candidate genes on the homologous
genomic segments of closely or distantly related organisms.

Background
Whole genome sequence data from an ever increasing
number of organisms is providing increased potential
into the understanding of the processes and mechanisms
of genomic rearrangements that have occurred during animal evolution. Such insights have mainly been gained
through genome comparisons of species that exhibit various degrees of phylogenetic relatedness on the tree of life.
One evolutionary process that is believed to have had a
significant impact on vertebrate evolution has been the
occurrence of up to four rounds of whole genome duplications (WGD) in their ancestral past. It is now generally
accepted that the first duplication event (1R) occurred at
the base of vertebrate evolution and was followed by a 2R
WGD that preceded the divergence of the Sarcopterygian
lineages (including the lobe-finned fishes), but before the
divergence of ray-finned (Actinopterygian) fishes at about
500 million years ago (MYA). These polyploidization
events were later followed by an additional round of
whole genome doubling in the ray-finned fish lineage
(i.e., 3R) ~320–350 MYA [1-7]. A gradual decay of the
genomes subsequent to WGD, mainly through asymmetric gene losses and interchromosomal rearrangements
had largely obliterated many of the traces of those ancient
events [8-10]. However, the availability of the whole
genome sequence data from diverse organisms, have
allowed scientists to infer the proto-karyotypes of not
only the teleost ancestor but also the ancestor to all vertebrates [3,11-15]. According to a recent model, 10
(denoted as chromosomes A'-J' in this study) and possibly
up to 13 chromosomes, constituted the genome of the
ancient vertebrate ancestor, prior to the 1R WGD [15].
Two subsequent polyploidization events along with some
major genome rearrangements, caused the number of
chromosomes to increase to about 40–52 in various gnathostomes [15]. In the ray-finned fish lineage, however,
intensive fusions reduced the number of linkage groups to
about 12–13 (denoted as chromosomes A-M) [3,11-15].
Following the 3R duplication, a doubling of this chromosome number would be expected, and is indeed observed
in many present day extant teleosts (i.e., modal linkage
group numbers in teleosts are 24–25, 2n = 48–50) [e.g.,
[3,13]].
Among fishes, it has long been hypothesized that salmonids have originated from an autotetraploid ancestor (i.e.,
4R) [1]. The possession of a genome size and chromosome arm numbers that are approximately twice the
number of those detected in closely related species (i.e.,
NF = 96–104), the observation of multivalent formation
during meiosis, and the identification of many duplicated
loci pairs that assign to the homeologous chromosome
arms provided support for an autopolyploid origin. Furthermore, the observation of meiotic segregation patterns
that match both disomic and tetrasomic ratios, is an indication that salmonids are still in the process of reverting

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/278

back to the diploid state [1,16,17]. Recent efforts in the
construction of genetic and physical maps for various
fishes in this family have resulted in the identification of
many duplicated markers that map or assign to two different linkage groups, which likely arose from a single chromosome in the salmonid ancestor [e.g., [18-23]]. Further,
characterization of genes and expressed sequence tags
(EST) with multiple copies that localize to different linkage groups, and also the phylogenetic relationship among
these duplicates [e.g., [24-27]] are all in accordance with
the proposed evolutionary scenario suggested for this
family.
A primary focus of many recent genomic studies in salmonids has been the identification of the 4R chromosomal
segments [e.g., [19,24-27]]. Although many of the
expected homeologies (i.e., the most recent WGD paralogous chromosomal segments) have so far been identified
in several of these fishes, the assignments are still incomplete for any one species. Furthermore, the association of
the 4R duplicated homeologous regions to their ancestral
counterparts (i.e., 3R and older chromosomal affinities,
which we generally refer to as paralogous segments) is
incompletely understood at present, although recent data
on the pairwise associations of the 4R chromosomal segments in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) [27] support the proposed WGD
evolutionary model for teleosts [14,15]. Therefore, for
every duplicated 3R chromosomal segment in zebrafish
(Danio rerio) and medaka (Oryzias latipes), up to 4 wholearm orthologous regions (i.e., two sets of homeologs) can
be identified in salmonids [27]. It is evident that information on these genomic arrangements would be of particular interest, as they may help to elucidate the interrelationships associated with transcriptome and functional genomics studies, and they also provide more precise explanations regarding the distribution of duplicated
regions throughout the genomes of vertebrates.
A main objective in this study is to identify segments of
the rainbow trout genome with a possible shared ancestry,
representative of not only the 4R WGD, but also of the
earlier events. However, a major challenge in detecting
anciently derived inter-chromosomal regions in any
organism stems from the unbalanced gene losses between
paralogous segments [8]. Therefore, to partially correct for
this uneven pseudogenization among paralogs, we
mainly focused on genetically localizing a subset of conserved noncoding elements (CNE), with the assumption
that the rate of retention between duplicated CNE should
be greater than their up- or downstream target regions. It
has been suggested that many CNE possess gene regulatory functions [28,29] and genomic regions surrounding
CNE blocks appear to undergo intense purifying selection,
highlighting their potential adaptive importance [30,31].
Hence examination of copy number and distribution of

CNE elements within the salmonid genome may provide
researchers with greater insights into the chromosomal
affinities of more ancient paralogous chromosome arms.
CNE, some up to several hundreds of bases in length, have
been reported among all classes of vertebrates with some
elements showing greater sequence conservation or overlaps within certain lineages [31]. Although, noncoding
elements that were initially reported through the whole
genome comparison between human (Homo sapiens) and
pufferfish (Takifugu rubripes) appear to be highly preserved among all jawed vertebrates [28,32], greater CNE
divergence has been detected among teleost species, suggesting that the rates of sequence evolution may be somewhat accelerated in fishes [3,31,33]. Interestingly, CNE
are essentially absent from invertebrates and urochordates
[32] and only around 50 single copy elements have been
identified in cephalochordates [34-36]. It has been postulated that such a high inter-species sequence conservation,
which often even exceeds those detected for protein coding regions [37], is a likely consequence of negative selection, probably due to essential functional properties [3840]. Nonetheless, although the regulatory function of
some CNE have been supported through in vivo enhancer
assays [e.g., [28,29]], deletions of large genomic regions in
mice that contain many conserved elements resulted in no
detectable phenotypic variation [41,42]. This suggests that
at least a fraction of these constrained elements might not
be functionally important. Counter to this interpretation,
is the knowledge that many of these elements may have
arisen through both segmental and WGD events and thus
might exhibit an extensive redundancy in functional
enhancer or silencer properties within the cis-regulatory
motifs they possess. Hence multiple copies of related regulatory modules, some of which may be on the order of
only 15–20 bp in length, may be scattered throughout the
genome, making their complete elimination next to
impossible.
The larger intact tracts of signature CNE elements are typically dispersed unevenly throughout the genome, with a
tendency to congregate in clusters, usually proximate to
genes involved in animal development [28,35,43]. CNE
can be located within the untranslated or the intronic
regions of the genes, although a majority of them are
found at distances from several hundred Kbp to over Mbp
in either direction from their targeted gene sites, usually
within the gene desert segments of the genome [29,35].
These features make CNE extremely useful for comparative genomics studies, as they can be treated as 'anchor'
markers to examine the relative distribution of duplicated
chromosomal segments throughout the genomes of any
study organism. Such 'anchors' can then be utilized to
investigate the loss or retention of orthologous genes
which are syntenic within these paralogous regions (i.e.,
among species conserved synteny studies).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/278

In the present study, we first revisited the distribution of
conserved noncoding elements in zebrafish, humans, and
medaka in order to gain a better understanding of their
genome wide characteristics in rainbow trout. Of the current teleost species with more complete genetic information, zebrafish, a member of the Ostariophysan lineage, is
considered the most closely related to salmonids [44].
This fish has a typical teleost karyotype of 50 chromosomes (i.e., n = 25). We characterized and mapped CNE
elements located within each of the zebrafish linkage
groups onto the genetic map of rainbow trout. We then
inferred the possible chromosomal affinities of these elements in the ancient ray-finned fish ancestor prior to the
3R WGD. We also report a list of genes whose syntenic
association to these elements appear to have remained
unchanged across various vertebrate species that we investigated. The amplification efficiency of the newly developed CNE based primers were tested in two other
salmonid species, Atlantic salmon and Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus), where some polymorphic markers were
further localized to their respective homologous chromosomes. Through the segregation analysis of duplicated
CNE along with the synteny comparison with other
organisms, we identified 53 duplicated segments within
the rainbow trout genome, with possibly 40 of these
regions related to the earliest vertebrate 1R, 2R or 3R
WGD.

Results
CNE distribution throughout human, medaka and
zebrafish genomes
A total of 6862 conserved noncoding elements, recently
reported in fugu [28,45], were blasted against the
zebrafish (Zv7), medaka (HdrR) and the human
(NCBI36) genomes. As expected, these elements are nonrandomly distributed throughout the length of the chromosomes as they occur in localized islands [34]. The total
number of elements detected show a weak association
with the length of chromosomes in zebrafish and human
which is not apparent in medaka (see Additional file 1;
Pearson Correlation Coefficient – human: 0.60, p < 0.002;
zebrafish: 0.42, p < 0.034; medaka: 0.18, p < 0.5). The
highest number of elements were detected on Hs-2, -10
and -15 in human, Ol-3, -15 and -21 in medaka and Dr-7,
-9 and -13 in zebrafish, where all of these chromosomes
appear to be related to the C, D and J ancestral Actinopterygian proto-linkage groups. It is also evident that certain chromosomes are largely depauperate of CNE (e.g.,
Ol-18, Hs-21, Hs-Y and to some extent Hs-22). While Hs21 and Hs-22 show a mosaic affinity of different ancient
groupings, Ol-18 seems to have mostly been shaped by
the F ancestral linkage group [14]. From the analysis of the
gene ontology (GO) assignments for all genes on the Hs21 and Hs-22 and the human homologs of Ol-18 mainly
located on Hs-4 and Hs-9 [14], we identified the most
common "GO terms" on each of these chromosomes, to

be related to cytoplasm as well as intracellular part and
organelle (see Additional file 2).
CNE and sex chromosomes
To test whether the lack of CNE on Hs-Y is a derived characteristic of vertebrate hemizygous sex chromosomes, we
further screened the sex chromosomes of chimpanzee,
mouse as well as the W chromosome of chicken. No evidence of CNE signatures were detected on any of these
chromosomes.
Duplicated CNE
Through BLAST search analysis within the human,
medaka and zebrafish genomes, we identified 258, 504
and 427 CNE, respectively, that appear to have retained
their duplicated sequence motifs located within at least
two different linkage groups (see Additional file 3). In
human, the highest numbers of duplicates are located on
chromosomes 18/19, 8/10 and 5/16 and mostly correspond to the M ancestral grouping in the ancient rayfinned fish. In zebrafish and medaka, on the other hand,
multiple copy CNE clusters mainly reside on segments of
the ancient linkage groups D and J, with the greatest paucity within group F (see Additional file 4 – Fig. 1). These
ancestral groupings correspond to the paralogous segments of Dr-12/13 and Ol-9/15 (D group) as well as in Dr7/25 and Ol-3/6 (J group).

We next examined the power of duplicated conserved elements in identifying regions of the genome that originated from the 2R and 3R WGD. In particular we screened
for those clusters where the CNE signatures could be identified on more than two different chromosomes. Our
results are fairly consistent with the previous findings,
mainly based on the coding regions of the genome [15].
For example we found four paralogous blocks of conserved elements on Ol-9, -12, -15 and -19. Chromosomes
9 and 12 in medaka have largely been formed following
the duplication of the "I" linkage group in the ray-finned
fish lineage and share paralogy throughout most of their
length. Chromosome "D" is also known to have played a
major role in shaping Ol-15 and parts of Ol-19 [14].
Therefore, identification of paralogous CNE clusters on
those linkage groups is a suggestion that a single chromosome, possibly C' [15] in the gnathostome ancestor has
contributed to the formation of segments of the D and I
clusters in the teleost ancestor (see Additional file 4).
In a two-way comparison we further identified 214 duplicates and their corresponding homologous chromosomal
regions that have been retained between zebrafish and
medaka while each species share 137 and 142 of their
duplicated CNE with those of the human respectively. In
total however, our data suggest that up to 112 duplicates
have been retained between all three organisms investi-

14, 8/10, 9/10 and 18/19/20 contain the highest number
of conserved inter-species duplicated CNE (from 10–19
duplicates). Cross species comparisons also suggest that
these paralogous syntenic blocks, with high numbers of
duplicates, have further been retained on the homologous
segments of zebrafish and medaka, and are mostly related
to the Actinopterygian ancestral groupings A, B, D, E, I
and J (see Additional files 5 and 6).
Identification and genomic localization of selected CNE in
rainbow trout
In order to obtain a core CNE database suitable for comparative genomic analysis of highly conserved motifs
along with the putatively less conserved intervening
sequences across vertebrate species, we took advantage of
the clustered nature of these elements. Initially using the
zebrafish assembly version 6 [46], we screened all of this
species chromosomes for the distribution of those specific
CNE that where originally reported by Woolfe et al. [28].
The identified elements were then ranked according to
their locations along the zebrafish chromosomes. We

then selected from 1–3 pairs of CNE from each linkage
group, as long as they satisfied the following criteria: i.
highly similar sequences over at least 25–30 bp in the
alignment between fugu-zebrafish-human; ii. a physical
distance of more than 1000 bp and less than 10 Kbp
between the two CNE with a conserved association in all
species; and iii. genetic linkage between the two pairs on
the zebrafish chromosomes. It should be noted, however,
that in the new zebrafish genome assembly (Zv7) the
locations of several CNE have now been reassigned to new
chromosomes (Table 1).
Using the above strategy we developed 41 pairs of CNE
specific primers with the capability of amplifying conserved elements and their intervening genomic regions
from different chromosomes and across the genomes of
potentially a broad range of vertebrate species (see Additional file 7). In rainbow trout, we were able to successfully amplify 56 distinct fragments, corresponding to
about 150 Kbp sequence information with the GenBank
accession numbers FJ356092–FJ356147. Homologies
were accessed and confirmed through multi-species alignments with zebrafish and fugu and further visualized
using VISTA browser [47] (Additional file 8). These comparisons revealed blocks of high similarity (> 70%)
among all the teleost species investigated.
In order to identify the homologous chromosomal segments harboring these elements in rainbow trout, we further investigated their genomic locations using two
rainbow trout mapping panels [19,26]. Using different
mutational detection techniques in the four sex-specific
genetic maps for this species, 67 different chromosomal
regions had detectable CNE pair polymorphisms which
facilitated their mapping onto the rainbow trout mapping
panels. The distribution of the investigated CNE, suggests
a good coverage of the rainbow trout genome, as we were
able to localize at least one pair of CNE on every chromosome except for Om-26 (see Additional file 9 – Table 1).
Also, the position of CNE170–184 (orthologous to CNE
copies on Dr-18) on the genetic map still remains unassigned.
The analyses of the genomic positions of the duplicated
CNE further allowed us to investigate some of the previously reported homeologous chromosomal segments in
rainbow trout. In particular the localization of the duplicated CNE on linkage groups 2/9, 3/25, 5/31, 7/15, 10/
18, 13/23, 14/20 and 14/25 further confirms the suggested homeology between the duplicated segments of
these chromosomes [26] (Fig. 2). Also, some previous
findings, mainly based on a single duplicated microsatellite or gene-specific marker, have postulated possible
homeology between rainbow trout linkage groups 1/8, 3/
16, 7/19, 8/9, and 23/24. These putative homeologies

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/278

were inferred by localizing different copies of the growth
hormone receptors to Om-1/8 (Nichols et al. personal
communication), HoxA clusters and the major histocompatibility class I genes to Om-3/16 [20,24], adenylate
cyclase-activating polypeptide to Om-7/19 [48] and the
microsatellite markers OMM1825 and Omy27INRA to
Om-8/9 and Om-23/24 respectively [19,49]. The current
study provides additional support for these suggested
shared ancestries (Table 1 – Fig. 2).
Conversely, the genomic positions of a number of duplicated elements, points to the segments of rainbow trout's
genome whose homeology or paralogy have not been previously reported. For example, different copies of the
CNE391 were localized to Om-3, -18, -20 and -25. As
mentioned above, while Om-3 and -25 are duplicated
homeologs, any shared ancestry with Om-18 and -20 are
unknown. Further, in a number of instances, CNE pairs
that are linked on the homologous chromosomal segments between human-fish or zebrafish-medaka, were
localized to different linkage groups in rainbow trout (Fig.
2). For example, CNE432, CNE268–274 and CNE270–
275 are all associated with each other on Dr-7, Ol-3 and
Hs-11. However, while CNE432 has been localized to Om6 the two latter pairs of CNE were mapped to the homeologous segments of Om-10 and -18. Despite the inadequacy of syntenically conserved genetic markers
supporting this paralogy, our analysis suggests Om-6, -10,
-18 to all share synteny with a single 3R ancestral chromosome (i.e., J grouping) [27].
Considering the variation in the segregation patterns of
duplicated CNE and also the comparative analyses with
other model organisms, we now suggest 40 new potential
paralogous affinities in rainbow trout (Table 1 – Fig. 2).
Additional support for these proposed paralogies, except
for 16 putative affinities (i.e., Om-1/31; Om-3/8; Om-3/9;
Om-3/18; Om-3/20; Om-7/24; Om-8/20; Om-8/31; Om-9/
14; Om-11/15; Om-16/17; Om-16/22; Om-16/30; Om-18/
20; Om-18/25 and Om-19/31), were further provided
through BLAST search comparison of all genetically
mapped, rainbow trout type I markers against the
zebrafish and medaka's genomes. On the other hand, the
lack of support for the 16 duplicated regions might be a
reflection of either incomplete marker coverage in our
mapping panels, or represent segments of the genome
that carry traces of more ancient polyploidization events
(e.g., 2R). It should also be noted that based upon a recent
genome comparison between rainbow trout and the 3R
chromosomal segments in zebrafish and medaka [27], we
can postulate that an additional 18 putative duplicated
paralogous/homeologous regions may exist in the
genome of rainbow trout (Fig. 2). Currently, empirical
evidence is lacking for these possible duplicated affinities.

(i.e., B-related affinities). However, it is of interest to note
that in Arctic charr, while these two conserved elements
have been mapped to Sa-35, copies of the CNE903–904
have also been localized to Sa-6/19/23 (Table 1). Linkage
groups Sa-6/23/35 are known to share a number of duplicated genetic markers with each other as well as to show
partial homology to Om-27/31 in rainbow trout [26]. At
present, the only detectable homology with Sa-19 is to
linkage group Om-13 (ancestral M grouping). Both the M
and B 3R lineages share several gnathostome ancestral
linkage group affinities (i.e., E', A' and B') [15].

duplicated genetic markers or according to the comparative
analysis with other model organisms. Acrocentric chromosomes are depicted in boldface on the Oxford grid axes.

CNE affinities among salmonids
In order to test the cross salmonid amplification of the
primers specifically developed for the genotyping assays
(see Additional file 10 for inter-salmonid amplification
efficiency) and the merit of CNE markers for homology
comparison between closely related species, we further
investigated the genomic location of a subset of these conserved elements in the genomes of Atlantic salmon and
Arctic charr (see Additional file 9 – Table 1). In the majority of cases where we could detect amplified polymorphisms in these two species, CNE were localized to their
previously designated homologous linkage groups
[26,27]. Also in a few instances the genomic location of
CNE in Atlantic salmon and Arctic charr, when compared
with each other or compared with the data from zebrafish,
medaka and human, can provide additional support for
the suggested paralogies in rainbow trout. For example,
CNE996–1102 and CNE998–1310, which are associated
on Dr-5/24, Ol-12 and Hs-5, were also linked on Sa-5 in
Arctic charr. In rainbow trout these markers were localized
to Om-1/8/19/31, supporting the proposed paralogy
between them. While Om-1/8/19 carry traces of the teleost
linkage group I, the mapping location of CNE998–1310
to Om-31p suggests an origin to the B chromosome [27].
Lineages I and B are known to share homology to the A'
gnathostome linkage group [15]. Similarly, mapping the
duplicated copies of the CNE548–549 and CNE903–904
to the homeologous segments of Ss-1/12 and their associated linkage on Sa-35 further corroborates the suggested
shared ancestry between Om-16q and Om-27p (Fig. 2)

CNE based homology comparisons and candidate gene
association analysis
The genetic mapping of conserved noncoding elements in
the rainbow trout genome enabled us to identify homologous regions with the other species investigated. The 28
rainbow trout linkage groups, where these elements have
been localized, suggest homology to 19, 17 and 16 different chromosomes in zebrafish, medaka and human
respectively (see Additional file 11 – Table 1), and provide
additional support for similar EST-based comparisons
among these teleost genomes [27].

Next, we investigated the association of those CNE to
upstream and downstream genes in the three vertebrate
organisms. We confined our search to 2.5 Mbp windows,
as this has been suggested to be the maximum target limit
of a CNE [35]. For data to be reliable and applicable to
other vertebrate systems, we only considered genes whose
associations have been retained between zebrafish,
medaka and human. Through such a conservative
approach, 183 genes were recognized (see Additional file
12), where the gene ontology assignments are mainly represented by the GO terms related to the transcriptional
regulation and development (data not shown).
In order to test for the association of these elements to
their target genes in salmonids, we further BLASTN analyzed all the genetically mapped rainbow trout type I
markers against this gene database. From this analysis ten
genes and genomic clusters with the expectation values
less than 10-6, which included myogenic factors 5 and 6 as
well as HoxA and HoxC genomic complexes, all exhibit
association to their designated CNE (Table 2).

Discussion
Genomic distribution of conserved elements
One of the characteristics of the conserved noncoding elements is their uneven distribution throughout the
genome and across various chromosomes [28]. By localizing the genomic origin of each CNE from human,
zebrafish and medaka to their ancient Actinopterygian
grouping, we suggest that the highest retention of CNE
have been preserved on the chromosomal regions

descendent from the C, D and J segments. This overrepresentation is mainly due to the clustered organization of
CNE on those particular chromosomal segments, where
they exhibit a high degree of conserved synteny usually
over a short physical distance in all the species investigated. Such a compact arrangement, on the designated
regions of specific homologous chromosomes in different
organisms, is a possible indication of a synchronized
action of cassettes of regulatory modules through a cisregulatory mechanism upon particular gene(s). Therefore,
it is reasonable to speculate that not only the syntenic
association of some CNE, but also the distance between
these elements might prove crucial for the regulation of
certain genes [50].
Conversely, considering the paucity of conserved element
signatures on Hs-21, Hs-22, Hs-Y and Ol-18, we can make
broad inferences with regard to the type of genes whose
regulation and function might not be CNE dependent. In
particular the commonality of the specific GO terms
(Additional file 2) identified on Hs-21, Hs-22 and Ol-18
with the overrepresented cellular component annotations
associated to cytoplasm, as well as intracellular part and
organelle, indicates that these genes likely act in a CNE
independent manner. Similarly, loci on the hemizygous
chromosomes, particularly those with a sex-specific function, are also expected to act in an independent manner.
Notably, Hs-21 and Hs-Y, are the only two chromosomes
in the human genome which are depleted from any tetraparalogon (i.e., syntenic duplicated genes that occur at
exactly four positions in the genome) [5], supporting the
empirical evidence for a relatively recent origin for the
hominid sex chromosomes [51].
From an evolutionary perspective, CNE elements are
proving to be powerful markers for not only identifying
the most recently duplicated regions of the genome, but
also for detecting segments that have resulted from more
ancient polyploidization events in the gnathostome lineage. The validity of this statement is apparent when considering the identified duplicated CNE in human and fish

that correspond to the 2R and 3R whole genome duplications [e.g., [3,5,11,29]]. Recently, Nakatani et al. [15],
using protein sequence information from various organisms, have reconstructed the ancestral vertebrate karyotype, by identifying genomic regions that carry genetic
traces originating from the 1R and 2R WGD. Our results
based on the conserved noncoding elements corroborate
the findings inferred from analysis of these functional
regions of the genome. This reinforces the idea that the
constraints causing the CNE-gene association to remain
uninterrupted throughout vertebrate history should also
make these elements reliable genetic markers in comparative studies.
Although some of the CNE duplicates appear to have been
retained in a lineage specific manner, strong selection
pressure seems to be acting upon subsets of these elements that are present in multiple copies throughout the
genomes of zebrafish, medaka and human. Further, the
frequencies of these duplicates are not always correlated
with the paralogons' genomic distribution. For instance,
while the highest number of human paralogs are on the
chromosome pairs 1q/9q, 7q/17q, 2q/12q, 15q/18q, 1q/
6q and 5q/15q [2], the CNE duplicates are mostly clustered throughout 2p/14q, 8p/10q and 18p/19p/20p.
Nonetheless, there exists a partial paralogy between those
latter chromosomal segments, suggesting a potentially
conserved influence of the duplicated CNE on the paralogous genes within those regions. In fact, McEwen et al.
[29] have reported 124 families of duplicated CNE in the
human genome where about 98% of them were assigned
to a single or multiple copies of paralogous genes with the
main function related to transcription or development.
Further, through functional analysis of 5 duplicated elements, the authors showed 8 out of 10 CNE to be capable
of up-regulating the expression of reporter gene in a tissue-specific manner.
In a few instances, however, the genomic locations of the
CNE duplicates are not associated with any known paralogs. For example, we identified a cluster of 10 duplicated

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:278

elements, with a very high degree of conserved synteny,
on Hs-9p/10q. Yet, these chromosomes share only two
paralogs on their q arms [2]. Therefore, while the regulation of many genes throughout the genome might be
influenced by single copy CNE and the association of
many duplicated CNE to the paralogous genes might be
due to functional cues, some multiple copy CNE seem to
have a regulatory influence upon different gene types. The
most likely evolutionary scenario for such CNE can be
explained if at least some of these elements have a regulatory action on an array of genes. Genome duplication is
generally expected to relax the cis-constraints imposed on
these regulatory modules. Therefore, an unbalanced pseudogenization accompanied by interchromosomal rearrangements can potentially erase all signatures of ancient
polyploidization from the duplicated segments except for
the multi-gene regulatory elements which should remain
within those regions.
Conserved noncoding elements in rainbow trout
Recent studies of expressed sequence tags and candidate
genes in rainbow trout, Atlantic salmon and Arctic charr
indicate that their genome architecture has been influenced greatly by the 4R duplication [e.g., [19,21,52]].
Here, we further attempted to understand the evolutionary structure of the rainbow trout genome, based on the
distribution of a number of conserved noncoding elements within salmonids and their conserved synteny
across vertebrates. Making such general inferences is possible as these elements were identified on almost all the
rainbow trout linkage groups investigated. As discussed
above, due to the evolutionary persistence of some multigene regulatory elements within the vertebrate genomes,
CNE can be an extremely efficient tool for revealing chromosomal segments descendent from very ancient polyploidization events. So, it is not surprising that in this
study many new putative paralogy affinities were identified based on the variation in the segregation patterns of
the duplicated CNE. A main challenge, however, is to
unambiguously identify those duplicated genetic elements that have arisen from the 4R WGD versus those of
the earlier events, possibly even extending back to the
proto-vertebrate 1R segments.

The identification of the 4R duplicates can be confounded
by the remnants of earlier polyploidization events and
interchromosomal rearrangements or translocations following the salmonid-specific duplication. Such chromosomes will show a mosaic affinity with other linkage
groups throughout the length of a given chromosome arm
that has undergone such rearrangements. The genome of
rainbow trout has mainly been shaped through whole
arm fusions of two acrocentric chromosomes with some
subsequent fissions, following possible inversions [53].
Under the most parsimonious scenario it is expected that

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/278

every bi-armed or metacentric linkage group will share
homeology with at least two other chromosomal arms.
The genomes of rainbow trout mapping families investigated in this study consist of 23 metacentric and 6 acrocentric chromosomes (i.e., Om-1; -11; -13; -18; -26 and 30) [27,54]. Given the fact that the modal chromosome
arm range in rainbow trout is about 100–104 [53], a minimum of 25–26 homeologous pairs are expected in this
species.
Using a comparative genomics approach to analyze the 3R
homologous groupings between zebrafish and medaka
with the gene map information of rainbow trout and
Atlantic salmon, Danzmann et al. [27] have postulated a
number of ancestral chromosomal segments with a
potential shared ancestry in these species and suggested
the location of 25 putative paralogy/homeology associations within rainbow trout. Although these findings may
indicate that the majority of the homeologous affinities in
this organism have been identified, not all these regions
can confidently be ascribed to the 4R event, as some inferences are only based on either a single duplicated marker
or are based upon a shared synteny comparison with
other model teleost organisms. In general, homeologous
ancestry might more reliably be inferred if the syntenic
associations of two or more markers can be identified over
large map distances. Also, it is expected that the most
recently derived WGD paralogous segments (i.e., homeologs) will harbor a greater number of duplicated markers, compared to those regions derived from more ancient
duplications. In the present study, our data help to support the putative homeology between Om-1/8; 3/16; 7/
19; 8/9 and 23/24 that were previously suggested on the
basis of a single duplicated marker [20,24,48,49]. Therefore, at least 22 homeologous chromosomal pairs in rainbow trout, that contain two or more duplicated syntenic
markers, can more reliably be assigned as the genomic
segments that have originated following the salmonid
specific duplication.
Our data also allow us to further differentiate between
some of the 2R/3R versus the 4R duplicates, either by analyzing those CNE that were assigned to more than two
linkage groups with a previously established homeology
association between a pair, or through screening the conserved elements whose synteny have been retained in
zebrafish, medaka and human but were localized to different chromosomes in rainbow trout. Through such an
intra- and inter-species comparisons, we now suggest new
potential ancient paralogies between linkage groups [Om3/25(GH)]-[Om-18(J) and -20(GH)], [Om-1/8(I)]-[Om19(I) and -31(B)], [Om-10/18(J)]-[Om-6(J)], [Om-9/2/
29(E)]-[Om-24(M)]. Also, by limiting the search to a two
way human-fish or fish-fish analysis, the data further supports common ancestry between chromosomes [Om-8/

9(I)]-[Om-3(GH) and -20(GH)], [Om-14/25(A)]-[Om23(M)/24(A/M)], [Om-17/22(D)]-[Om-6/30(D) and 16(B)], [Om-7/15(K)]-[Om-11(GH) and -24(A)], [Om14/20(F)]-[Om-2/9(E)] and [Om-12]-[Om-29]-[Om-21]
(all L lineage affinities). While some suggested paralogies
can clearly be traced back to the 3R WGD (e.g., Om-10/18/
6 where all can be assigned to group J), others carry signatures that can be interpreted as affinities resulted from
more ancient polyploidization events.
A recent model [15] postulated the existence of about 10
core linkage groups (i.e., A'-J') at the base of the vertebrate
radiation, that followed two rounds of WGD generated
40–52 chromosomal segments in the gnathostome ancestor. Subsequent fusions and inter-chromosomal rearrangements further arrayed those ancestral clusters into
13 (i.e., A-M) basal proto-Actinopterygian linkage groups.
According to this model, for instance, the ancient teleost
A and B chromosomes shared paralogy, which was the
result of segmental inheritance of the B' linkage group
from the vertebrate ancestor. Our suggested paralogies on
the basis of the CNE chromosomal positions, are mainly
consistent with this proposed evolutionary scenario
(Table 1). For example the reported shared ancestry
between [Om-14/20(F)]-[Om-2/9(E)] is a likely reflection
of the duplicated A' signatures, carried by both E and F
groupings in teleosts. The only paralogy not fully supported with this model of the vertebrate chromosome
evolution is the association between [Om-7/15(K)]-[Om11(GH) and -24(A)], as the ancient D' lineage, that comprised the whole length of the K linkage group is not currently known to share any synteny duplicates within the A
or GH clusters [15]. This is perhaps a consequence of an
incomplete coverage of the investigated rainbow trout
genetic maps or due to our current incomplete understanding of the relationships among all descendant protovertebrate chromosomes.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/278

the three investigated teleost species appear to be comparable in the number of their retained 3R duplicated CNE,
there are mosaic affinities in the preservation of these elements among various organisms. Nonetheless, one of the
interesting findings of this study is that distinct chromosome-specific CNE markers in zebrafish have also identified distinct chromosome arms in rainbow trout. This
indicates that at least within these two Malcopterygian
species their genomes have evolved with relatively modest
chromosomal rearrangements as otherwise greater clustering of multiple CNE association within fewer rainbow
trout linkage groups would have been observed. Therefore, among some teleost species CNE markers could be of
high utility in identifying distinct homologous chromosomes within the genomes.

Methods

Conclusion

Similarity searches of fugu's CNE in human, zebrafish and
medaka
Fugu conserved noncoding elements were obtained from
the COnserved Non-coDing Orthologous Regions (CONDOR) website [45,55] and were used as blast query
against the zebrafish (Zv7), medaka (HdrR) and the
human (NCBI36) genomes as well as the mouse (NCBI
m37),
chimpanzee
(CHIMP2.1)
and
chicken
(WASHUC2) Y and W chromosomes, all downloaded
from the ENSEMBL [46] database. Local blast searches
were carried out under the default settings of the Distant
Homology BLASTN in ENSEMBL (word size of nine, mismatch penalty of -1), with an E-value cutoff of £10-6. Programs written in SAS language (ver 9) [56] were used to
remove redundancies by merging the overlapping regions
and to further identify intra- and inter-species CNE duplicates and the distribution of conserved element throughout the length of the chromosomes. The information
regarding assignment of the ancestral proto-Actinopterygian chromosomes within the genomes of human,
zebrafish and medaka were obtained from the study by
Kasahara et al. [14].

As predicted, CNE appear to provide greater insights into
the ancient paralogous regions of species genomes compared to coding sequences. Although many CNE duplicates detected in this study seem to have been arisen from
the most recent 4R WGD, it is also evident that this class
of genetic marker is much more informative in revealing
earlier ancient polyploidizations in regions where no signature of duplicated simple sequence repeats or type I
markers has been identified. As evident from the examples
above, ancient paralogous regions will more efficiently be
identified if the segregation patterns of multi copy CNE
are assessed along with their syntenic configuration with
other elements across a range of model organisms. Such
paralogies can further be validated if the origin of those
chromosomal segments, harboring putative duplicates,
can be traced back to their ancestry roots. However, while

Identification of selected CNE in rainbow trout
The conserved noncoding elements in zebrafish that met
the selection criteria (see Results) were aligned to their
orthologous counterparts in fugu and human by means of
Clustal X [57]. Primer3 [58] was mainly used for designing CNE specific primers, considering the identified consensus blocks as templates (Additional file 7). Total
rainbow trout genomic DNA was isolated from various
tissues [59] followed by polymerase chain reactions
(PCR), carried out in 50 mL reaction tubes. The PCR cocktails consisted of 80 ng template DNA, 1× PCR buffer
(Invitrogen), 2 mM MgSO4, 0.2–0.4 mM primer mix, 0.2
mM of each dNTP (Fisher Scientific) and 1 U of High
Fidelity Platinum Taq polymerase (Invitrogen). The
amplification conditions were as followed: initial dena-

turation at 94°C for 30 s that was followed by 35 amplification cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 48–62°C for 30 s and 68°C
for 1–10 min (1 min per Kbp). PCR products were subsequently purified (QIAquick PCR purification system; Qiagen) and inserted into the pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega)
prior to sequencing.
CNE nomenclature
We followed the nomenclature outlined by Woolfe et al.
[28] for designating conserved noncoding elements and
Jackson et al. [60] for distinguishing duplicated markers,
where homeologous or paralogous CNE are differentiated
with a lowercase /i, /ii, /iii or /iv.
Mapping of CNE in the rainbow trout, Atlantic salmon and
Arctic charr genetic maps
Details of the three salmonid species reference panels
investigated in this study have previously been described
[26]. CNE specific primers were designed to generate PCR
products, suitable for use in various mutation detection
techniques [61,62] (Additional file 10). Polymerase chain
reactions were performed in 7 mL reaction volumes, with
one of the primers being 5'-fluorescently end-labeled with
tetrachloro-6-carboxyfluorescein (TET). The PCR reaction
mixture consisted of 30 ng of template DNA, 1× PCR
buffer, 0.2 mM each dNTP (Fisher Scientific), 0.1 mM of
each primer, 2 mM MgCl2 and 0.15 U of the GoTaq DNA
polymerase (Promega). The PCR cocktails were then subjected to the following amplification conditions: initial
denaturation at 94°C for 4 min followed by 35 amplification cycles of 94°C for 20 s, 48–62°C for 20 s and 72°C
for 30 s. Details on the mutation detection strategies and
linkage mapping have previously been outlined [24,6163].
Identification of genes associated with CNE
The conserved syntenic genes among zebrafish, medaka
and human that flank the investigated set of CNE in rainbow trout, were identified through a 2.5 Mbp window,
using BioMart from the Ensemble Website. The GOstat
[64] program was used to find statistically overrepresented GO terms in this group of genes. This program was
also used to identify common, overrepresented terms,
associated to the genes located on all Hs-21, Hs-22, Ol-18
as well as Hs-Y.

Authors' contributions
HKM carried out the sequence data analysis, annotations,
genotyping, bioinformatics analysis, and drafted the manuscript along with contributions from RGD. RGD also
helped with the bioinformatics analysis, and along with
MMF and HKM developed the overall design of the
research. All authors read and commented on the manuscript.
