Abstract
Background: Reconstruction of biological pathways is typically done through mapping well-characterized
pathways of model organisms to a target genome, through orthologous gene mapping. A limitation of such
pathway-mapping approaches is that the mapped pathway models are constrained by the composition of the
template pathways, e.g., some genes in a target pathway may not have corresponding genes in the template
pathways, the so-called “missing gene” problem.
Methods: We present a novel pathway-expansion method for identifying additional genes that are possibly
involved in a target pathway after pathway mapping, to fill holes caused by missing genes as well as to expand
the mapped pathway model. The basic idea of the algorithm is to identify genes in the target genome whose
homologous genes share common operons with homologs of any mapped pathway genes in some reference
genome, and to add such genes to the target pathway if their functions are consistent with the cellular function of
the target pathway.
Results: We have implemented this idea using a graph-theoretic approach and demonstrated the effectiveness of
the algorithm on known pathways of E. coli in the KEGG database. On all KEGG pathways containing at least 5
genes, our method achieves an average of 60% positive predictive value (PPV) and the performance is increased
with more seed genes added. Analysis shows that our method is highly robust.
Conclusions: An effective method is presented to find missing genes in biological pathways of prokaryotes, which
achieves high prediction reliability on E. coli at a genome level. Numerous missing genes are found to be related
to knwon E. coli pathways, which can be further validated through biological experiments. Overall this method is
robust and can be used for functional inference.

Background
Reconstruction of biological pathways is a fundamental
problem in understanding the functional mechanisms of
cellular organisms. Substantial efforts have been put
into the elucidation of biological pathways, particularly
for prokaryotic organisms, in a systematic manner based
on high-throughput omic data and computational prediction. As a result, a number of pathway databases
have been developed and are being widely used, such as

KEGG and BioCyc [1-5]. These databases not only serve as
an information resource for retrieving well-characterized
pathways for specific organisms but also provide a set of
pathway templates for reconstructing pathways for
organisms that are not directly covered by the databases,
as substantial portions of homologous pathways may be
conserved across different organisms, particularly related
organisms.
A number of computer programs have been developed
for pathway reconstruction through mapping known
pathways from one organism to another. While some
success has been reported on these programs, there has
been a general issue associated with such homologous
pathway mapping-based approaches, which is that

homologous pathways are generally not identical and
hence the mapped pathways could miss some parts not
covered by their well-characterized homologous template pathways. This problem, called pathway holes or
missing genes, has been widely recognized [6-9]. A number of methods have been developed to find such missing genes, based mainly on the idea of finding genes
that are functionally associated with genes already in the
mapped pathways. One class of such methods attempts
to find enzyme-encoding genes missing in a mapped
metabolic pathway based on multiple types of gene association information [8-10], taking advantage of the fact
that genes encoding a metabolic pathway tend to group
into clusters (e.g., operons). Another class of methods
attempt to identify functional modules from some large
gene association networks or groups [11-15], and then
to suggest possible candidates for missing genes based
on genes found in the same functional modules of genes
already in mapped pathways. While these methods have
provided useful information for searching for missing
genes, there is clearly substantial room for improvement
in terms of the functional specificity of their predicted
candidates and the scope of applicability of the existing
methods [16]. Among the various areas for further
improvements, we identified a few we can possibly
improve on using the currently available information:
(i) there have not been reliable methods for consideration and inclusion of functionally uncharacterized genes
(often referred to as hypothetical and conserved genes)
into partially predicted pathway models (e.g, mapped
pathways); (ii) while (conserved) genomic synteny has
been utilized for prediction of functionally associated
genes, its true usefulness, other than operon information, is yet to be well documented. Previous studies have
shown that there is a strong link between genes in the
same operons and genes working in the same biological
pathways [17]. So full utilization of operon information
should be a key direction for improving biological pathways, particular now as the state of the art prediction
methods for operons have reached high accuracy
(~90%) [17-19].
We present, in this paper, a novel computational
method for identification and functional annotation of
missing genes in a predicted pathway model, either
through homologous pathway mapping or using other
methods. The basic idea of the method can be outlined
as follows. For any specified target genome, we define a
distance between any pair of genes in the genome to
measure the level of their functional relatedness in
terms of a set of reference genomes. Specifically, two
genes are functionally related if they (i) are homologous,
(ii) share a common operon directly or through their
homologs in a reference genome, (iii) are phylogenetically related, or (iv) deemed to be functionally related

Page 2 of 12

through combinations of the first three criteria. For any
pair of functionally related genes in the target genome,
their distance is defined essentially as the minimum
number of applications of this recursive definition. Our
algorithm identifies genes possibly involved in a target
pathway based on their distances to genes already in the
pathway. We have tested the algorithm on all characterized pathways of E. coli, using portions of the pathways
as the initial pathway genes (called seeds), and found
that the vast majority of the remaining genes of these
known pathways are all within short distances to the
seeds, confirming the effectiveness of our distance measure. Our study has also identified numerous genes with
short distances to the known pathway genes, which we
believe are highly promising candidates for addition to
these known E. coli pathways. Limited analyses of the
potential functional roles of these genes have been carried out, and reported in this paper.

Methods
High-level description of our algorithm

We first represent genes in the target genome or in a
set of specified reference genomes, and their functional
relatedness as a graph, called a reference graph, where
each gene in any of the genomes is represented as a vertex, and two genes have an edge linking them if they are
in the same operon or they are homologous. We then
define a linkage graph for the target genome such that
each gene is represented as a vertex and two genes have
an edge if and only if there is a path linking the two
genes in the reference graph, and the distance of the
edge is defined as the distance of the shortest path
between the two genes in the reference graph. We have
augmented this distance by including two additive
terms, one penalty factor (system(error)) used to model
the reliability of a predicted functional relationship, and
a phylogeny-based distance used to capture coevolutionary relationships, more general than homology
relationships among genes, between two genes. Our goal
here is to find genes that have short distances, defined
above, to genes in a known pathway, and predict that
they are involved in this pathway if their distances are
ranked among the top such genes. The whole procedure
is summarized in Figure 1, with the detailed steps
explained as follows.
Selection of reference genomes

Currently over 1,000 bacterial and archaean genomes
have been sequenced and are publicly available (NCBI
release of September 2009). From this set, we have
selected 185 strains (non-redundant genomes and plasmids) (see Additional File 1) from 185 different genera
using the following rule: for each genus, select the
genome with the longest sequence.

Figure 1 The flow chart of the method. The method uses gene similarity and operon information to first construct a genome reference
graph. It then hierarchically fuses the shortest path distance and phylogenetic distance to rank all candidate genes.

Calculation of homology-based distance

For each pair of genes xi, xj, in the target genome and the
185 reference genomes, we use the E-value of BLAST
(with default parameters) to define their homology-based
distance ds(xi, xj) as follows:
log p s ( x i , x j )
⎧
⎪1 +
d s(x i , x j ) = ⎨
185
⎪
0
⎩

p s(x i , x j ) ≠ 0

(1)

p s(x i , x j ) = 0

where ps(xi, xj) is the BLAST E-value for genes xi, xj,
and 185 is a normalization factor since when the
E-value is smaller than 1e-185, it is set as 0 in the
BLAST program. Clearly ds(xi, xj) is between 0 and 1;
and the more similar two genes are, the smaller the ds
(xi, xj) value is.
Calculation of operon-based distance

We have used the operons predicted using our own
program [18], which is considered the most reliable
operon prediction method in the public domain [17].
A probability calculated by this method represents the
likelihood that two neighbouring genes are in the same
operon. We apply this program to all of the 185

reference genomes and get the probability p o (x i , x j )
between two genes xi, xj in each genome. For any pair
of neighbouring genes xi, xj in the same genome (target
or reference), we define their operon-based distancedo(xi,
xj) as follows:
⎧
0
,
p o(x i , x j ) = 1
⎪
d o ( x i , x j ) = ⎨ −1 / log p o ( x i , x j ) , 0 < p o ( x i , x j ) < 1
⎪
1
,
p o(x i , x j ) = 0
⎩

(2)

where po(xi, xj) represents the probability that xi, xj are
in the same operon as given in [18].
Reference graph and linkage graph

We define a reference graph over all genes in the target
as well as the reference genomes as follows. Each gene
is represented as a vertex, and an edge between two
genes is created if (i) the two genes are in the same
operon, with their edge distance defined to be the
operon-based distance between the two genes; or (ii) the
two genes in different genomes are homologous, with
their edge distance defined to be their homology-based
distance. Based on the reference graph, we define a linkage graph on genes in the target genome. For any pair

Chen et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2011, 12(Suppl 1):S1
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/S1/S1

Page 4 of 12

of genes, xi, xj, we define an edge between them if and
only if there is a path x i , x 1 ,x 2 , … x j in the reference
graph, with its edge distance set to be the distance of
the shortest path between the two genes (Figure 2). We
intend to use an edge in this graph to capture a functional linkage relationship possibly through multiple
steps of co-operon and homologous relationship. We
recognize that the reliability of such defined edges could
go down (largely independent of the reliability of individual operon and homology predictions) as the number
of edges in the above path goes up. Hence we included
a penalty factor, system (error), which is proportional to
the number of edges in the path, and redefined the path
distance of a gene pair as follows:
d path ( x i , x j ) =

∑

 ⋅ d o ( s) +

s∈E(operon)

∑

t∈E( similarity )

d s (t ) + k ⋅ system(error )

(3)

where k is the number of edges in the path, and a is a
scaling factor. In our current implementation, we set a =
380 and system(error) = 0.06 based on a ten-fold crossvalidation method (see Parameter Selection). E(operon)
and E(similarity) are the set of operon edges and the set
of similarity edges, respectively.
Phylogeny-based distance

We also considered a more general class of functional
relationship defined in terms of the phylogenetic profiles of genes, which measures their co-evolutionary

relationship [20,21]. Basically, the phylogenetic profile
X of a gene against a set of n reference genomes is a
binary string of length n, with the ith position being 1,
if the gene has a homolog in the ith reference genome,
and 0 otherwise. It has been found that two genes (of
the same genome) are generally functionally related if
their phylogenetic profiles are highly similar [20]. We
have used a BLAST E-value e-3 as the cutoff for determining the presence of a homolog in another genome
[22]. We use the following to measure the similarity
between two phylogenetic profiles, similar to that
reported in [23]. Given the phylogenetic profiles Xi and
Yj for genes xi and yj, their phylogeny-based distance is
defined as follows:
d phy ( x i , y j ) =

d ham min g ( X i , X j )

1
⋅
1 + 2 ⋅ Entropy( X i , X j ) n

(4)

where, d hamming (X i , X j ) is the Hamming distance
between Xi and Xj, and Entropy (Xi, Xj) is the entropy of
the common part of Xi and Xj, defined as follows:
Entropy( X i , X j ) = −p log p − (1 − p) log(1 − p)

(5)

with p being the frequency of 1’s in common positions
between the two phylogenetic profiles. Note that the
more similar two phylogenetic profiles are, the smaller
their distance is.

Figure 2 The relationship path through operon edge and similarity edge. Given a reference pathway, its known genes are used as seeds
to calculate the shortest distances to candidate genes. For example, gene1 and gene2 are connected with the same candidate gene. The path
from gene1 to candidate gene (path1) is noted as solid line, and gene2 to candidate gene (path2) as dashed line. The paths are both
constructed by operon edge (colour arrow) and similarity edge (solid or dashed line).

Rank functional relatedness of candidate genes

Our goal here is to rank all the genes in a target genome in terms of a possible relationship with a set of
seed genes (known genes in a pathway), by fusing the
path distance and the phylogeny-based distance. For a
given pathway P, let its known gene set be G(P) and |G
(P)| be the number of its genes. We define a distance
from P to a candidate gene xi as

d path (P , x i ) =

∑

(6)
G(P )

Similarly, we define a phylogenetic distance from P to
xias

d phy (P , x i ) =

SE( x) = TP( x) / (TP( x) + FN( x))

(9)

SP( x) = TN( x) / (TN( x) + FP( x))

(10)

PPV ( x) = TP( x) / (TP( x) + FP( x))

d path ( x j , x i )

x j ∈G( P )

∑

measures of sensitivity (SE), specificity (SP) and positive
predictive value (PPV) to assess the performance of our
prediction method of missing genes:

(11)

To assess the prediction performance against a set of
pathways, we use the average of the above three measures across all the pathways as follows:
SP =

d phy ( x j , x i )

(7)

x j ∈G( P )

∑ SP

Our experience has been that for both the path distance and the phylogenetic distance, the distance for the
top ranked genes tend to be more reliable. Hence only
the top K candidate genes to each gene x j ε G(P) are
considered and the remaining is ignored. To a seed
gene, we only take the K shortest genes measured by
reference distance, where the K is ranged from 5 to 30.
Similarly, only the top K( = 50) genes closed to a seed
gene is considered for phylogenetic distance [20]. So
some candidate genes may not have a path distance or
phylogenetic distance, due to their ranking. The final
combined distance from any gene x i to pathway P is
defined as

SE =

where b is a scaling factor and set to 5, based on the
ten-fold cross-validation method (see Parameter Selection); and T is set to be 2 if gene xi has both the path
distance and phylogenetic distance, and as 1 if it has
only one distance defined. The candidate genes are
ranked by their combined distance and the final top g
genes are output (g = 10 in this study).

where SP i, SEi and PPVi are SP, SE and PPV for the
ith pathway, respectively, and N is the number of pathways considered.
For each to-be-determined parameter in our program,
a ten-fold cross-validation procedure is used to derive
the optimal value. Specifically, all the pathways are
divided randomly into ten parts, nine for training and
one for testing each time. The value with the best average is finally selected. The leave-one-out cross-validation
procedure is used to assess the performance. For each
pathway, its known genes are used as the seed-gene set.
The procedure removes each gene from the pathway
seed set one at a time, and then calculates the final
combined distance from the remaining genes to the
removed gene and all the left genes of the target genome. If the removed gene is output in the final top g
genes, it is counted as a successful prediction.

Parameter Selection and Validation Method

Results

For a predicted target gene and a target pathway, the
gene is considered a positive prediction (based on a partial gene list of the pathway) if it is part of the pathway.
For any of the following assessments of our prediction,
we use the following (standard) notations: TP for true
positive predictions; TN for true negative predictions;
FP for false positive predictions and FN for false negative predictions (FN); and we use the following standard

We first tested our ranking algorithm on all the 121
KEGG pathways of E. coli K12. We have downloaded
these pathways from KEGG (released in September of
2009; see Additional File 2), of which 105 are metabolic
pathways, 11 are involved in genetic information processing, and 5 are involved in environmental information
processing. On these 121 pathways, the performance of

Chen et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2011, 12(Suppl 1):S1
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/S1/S1

our method was tested with different K ranging from 5
to 30. Figure 3 shows the accuracies of our algorithm
for different K and for pathways with different numbers
of assigned genes. It has near 90% prediction accuracy
(PPV) for K = 5, and the accuracy increases as the number of genes in a pathway increases. Also we noted that
the PPV value decreases with the increase of the K
value in general, suggesting a higher level of noise is
being included as K increases. We have also calculated
the SP and SE values for different K on 121 pathways;
the detailed data is shown in Additional File 3. We
noted that SE increases with the increase of K, achieving
near 78% since only the top K shortest genes were
considered.
While the major contribution to the prediction accuracy
by our method is from operon and homology information, we have also assessed the contribution from

Page 6 of 12

phylogentic profiles. We noted that the phylogenetic
profile gives a small increase for PPV (~ 4% for K = 5).
When K increases, the contribution also increases
(Figure 3). It shows that genes confirmed by the phylogenetic profile can reduce the mis-predicted genes from
the graph-based prediction results, and increase the PPV
value. This result suggests that phylogenetic profile can
detect some genes which cannot be found by operon or
sequence similarity alone.
One interesting observation we made is that our
method gives rise to different performance levels for
pathways in different functional categories. To fully
investigate this observation, we have tested our algorithm on 18 different functional categories of KEGG
pathways where each has at least 5 (assigned) genes.
One special care needs to be taken when assessing the
prediction performance as some KEGG pathways are

predicted to form one “combined” pathway by our prediction. For example, all the pathways in Amino Acid
Metabolism are put together into one combined “pathway”. Hence we need to evaluate the performance of
our method on this combined “pathway”. The performance on the 18 categories of KEGG pathways is generally good except for the category of Biosynthesis of
Secondary Metabolism, Metabolism of Other Amino
Acids, Transcription and Xenobiotics Biodegradation
and Metabolism (see Additional File 4). The reduced
performance may be due to two reasons: (i) some correctly predicted genes are regarded as false positives
since the combined pathway is incomplete; and (ii) the
combined pathways may not be conserved across different genomes; and hence cannot be inferred by our
method. We also calculated the PPV values of individual
pathways whose number of genes is at least 30. They all
have high prediction accuracy except for the Pyruvate
Metabolism Pathway, which only gets 40% prediction
accuracy (see Additional File 5).
Case study of the predicted pyruvate metabolism
pathway

We have carefully analyzed our prediction results on the
pyruvate metabolism pathway (eco00620) since it has
the worst prediction performance among all the 21

Page 7 of 12

E. coli pathways, each of which has at least 30 (assigned)
genes. This KEGG pathway currently consists of 41
annotated genes (released in September 2009); five
(pflD, tdcE, pflB, accC, ybiW) of them are correctly predicted in the top 10 by our method. Among the “incorrect” top 10 predictions (tdcD, eutD, ybiY, prpE, yiaY),
some have been reported as correct genes involved in
the pathway by a number of published papers. For
example, gene ybiY is predicted as a “pyruvate formate
lyase activating enzyme” in the NCBI and KEGG databases. Furthermore, we find three genes (tdcD, pflD,
prpE) are all in the same “Propanoate Metabolism”
pathway (eco00640), which is directly related to the pyruvate metabolism pathway. Actually, there are 10 genes
that are common in both pathways.
Gene yiaY is annotated as “Fe-containing alcohol
dehydregenas” and is predicted among the top 5 predictions by three known pathway genes (ybiC, adhE, fucO)
with the similarity connection path or the operon connection path (Figure 4). Both gene ybiC and gene yiaY
have homologous genes in genome (NC_007925) and
are reported as an operon with high probability
(≥ 0.999). The connections show that these two genes
are structured as an operon in NC_007925, while they
are diverged into different segments in E. coli. The gene
eutD is ranked among the top 5 predictions by three

pathway genes (maeA, maeB and pta) (Figure 5) connected by a similarity connection. These results suggested that our method can give a reasonable gene rank
list to a target pathway.
Robustness analysis of parameters

To test the robustness of our method, we calculated the
change in the average PPV value when the parameters
a, b and system(error) change. The initial parameter
values are set as K = 5, a = 380 and system(error) =
0.06. 71 pathways (with the number of assigned genes
≥ 10) are used, and the final average PPV of the top 10

Page 9 of 12

genes are calculated. For parameter x, the change rate is
defined as ( x − x 0 ) x and the related PPV change rate is
0

(PPV ( x) − PPV ( x 0 ))

PPV ( x 0 ) . For each parameter, the

change rate ranges from -1 to 1. The results show that
our method is very robust in terms of these three parameters. For example, when the change rate of system
(error) is -1, the related PPV change rate is only 0.0449
(Figure 6). It is a very small change compared with the
change of system(error). This result also shows that the
system(error) can give an extra 0.0449 contribution to
the final average PPV; and suggests that system(error) is

If a gene can be recalled by another gene in final top 10 ranks, then an edge is connected between the gene pair. 38 genes are recalled and
connected as five submodules. The biggest module has 23 genes and can be further divided as three parts.

useful in finding relationships in the reference graph.
These results suggest that the genome reference graph
is very useful and gives a major contribution to the final
result.

Discussion
Our method provides new insights about finding missing genes and recruiting additional genes into partially
predicted pathways in E. coli, through combining operon
information and homology information across multiple
genomes. Some wrongly predicted genes may indicate
pathways might be quite functionally related (as being
showed above, genes in eco00620 can recall many genes
in eco00640), since pathways are defined quite arbitrary
by biologists, this may remind us to think about the

Page 10 of 12

redefinition of some pathways. In some pathways, we
noted that some genes form (connected) functional
modules. We have systematically checked for this by
connecting two genes with a link if one gene can be
recalled by another gene among the top 10 predictions;
and used all the genes in eco00620 to reconstruct a new
graph with 5 connected components (Figure 7). The biggest component includes 23 genes and is the main functional module in pyruvate metabolism and can be
further parted into three smaller sub-modules (A1, A2
and A3), and we found all sub-modules are indicating
special biochemical processes (Figure 8). For example,
part C includes three genes from the same operon and
they are involved in the process to metabolize Pyruvate
to Acetyl-CoA in eco00620. The structures observed in

Figure 8 Mapped structures on the pathway of Eco00620 in KEGG. Five recalled modules can be well mapped on the described pathway
Eco00620 in KEGG. Each module can be mapped with a biochemical process.

Chen et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2011, 12(Suppl 1):S1

individual pathways and between pathways provide
more insights about the hierarchical structure of pathways and consisted with earlier studies [24-26].

Concluding remark
We present a method to find pathway genes at a genome
level, which can be used to fill pathway holes or recruit
new genes into existing pathways. The results show that
our method can achieve higher prediction accuracy and is
very robust. The main advantage of our method is that by
introducing the reference graph, we get a natural way to
integrate different types of information such as genomic
structure information and sequence similarity information.
More information could possibly be added in future studies. For example, we can use information like regulons
[27] and gene fusion events [28] to provide a more general
framework for integrating different information, which
can be easily included into our current program. Besides
finding new genes for pathways, our method can also be
used for functional module inference, as some functional
modules may be the union of existing pathways.
Additional material
