Abstract
Background: Benign or malignant lesions caused by Human papillomavirus (HPV) produce considerable health
burden worldwide. Since limited cross-protection would be offered between HPV types, heterogeneity in HPV
type-specific distribution should be taken into account when predicting the effect of current prophylactic vaccines
and forming the basic for the second-generation vaccines targeted to specific regions. Here, we investigated the
prevalence of cervical HPV infection, as well as predictors concerned, in Zhejiang Province, southeast China.
Results: Totally 4987 cervical samples from five randomly chosen counties in Zhejiang Province were detected. The
overall HPV prevalence was 13.3%. Established high-risk (HR) HPV prevalence was 10.2%. HPV-52 was the most
prevalent type (3.1%), followed by HPV-16 (2.5%), -58 (2.1%), -68 (1.0%) and -81 (0.9%). HPV-16 or -18 were present
in 3.1% of the detected samples, while 174 specimens (3.5%) were positive for any of HPV-6, -11, -16 and -18. The
prevalence of HPV vaccine types was consistently low across age groups. Bimodal age distribution in HR-HPV,
including established HR and probably HR-HPV, was observed, with a clear second peak in perimenopausal
women. Multivariate unconditional logistic regression models revealed that partner’s lifetime number of partners
was the only common independent predictor of overall, established HR, established low-risk, single-type and
multiple-type HPV infection in current study.
Conclusions: We have observed low prevalence of HPV vaccine types and relatively high prevalence of HPV-52
and -58 in our population. Our findings support universal “catch-up” vaccination of sexual experienced young
women in Zhejiang Province, as well as enhance the hypothesis that the second-generation HPV prophylactic
vaccines including HPV-52 and -58 may offer higher protection for women in China and other Asian areas.
Furthermore, our data support close surveillance of perimenopausal women with HR-HPV infection.

Background
Papillomaviruses (PVs) comprise of a large group of
non-enveloped double-stranded DNA viruses that infect
a variety of vertebrate species, including humans. There
are 16 genera of PVs and five of these genera, alpha,
beta, gamma, mu and nu, are human papillomaviruses
(HPVs). HPV infection may exist asymptomatically or
induce the formation of benign or malignant lesions of
human mucosal and cutaneous epithelia. HPV has been
shown to be the etiologic agent of anogenital, especially
cervical, cancers and a fraction of oropharyngeal

carcinomas. Other cancers causally linked to HPV
include non-melanoma skin cancer and conjunctiva carcinoma [1,2]. More than 100 HPV genotypes have been
molecularly characterized [1] and the types associated
with anogenital cancers, which are of greatest medical
importance, belong to the alpha-PV genus. According to
International Agency for Research on Cancer working
group, HPV-16, -18, -31, -33, -35, -39, -45, -51, -52, -56,
-58, and -59 were classified as “carcinogenic to humans”,
while HPV-6 and -11 were classified as “not classifiable
as to its carcinogenicity to humans” [3].
Both the two available prophylactic HPV vaccines, the
bivalent vaccine (Cervarix®, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals,
targeted at HPV-16 and -18) and the quadrivalent vaccine (Gardasil®, Merck, targeted at HPV-6, -11, -16 and

-18), have shown prominently type-restricted prophylactic efficacy for genital lesions related to targeted types in
women who were naive to the respective types at enrollment [4-7]. HPV vaccination also promises to decrease
the incidence of other HPV-related cancers, as well as
reduce the burden associated with the treatment of
HPV-related benign lesions [8]. Since limited cross-protection would be offered between HPV types [9], heterogeneity in HPV type-specific distribution from different
populations should be taken into account when predicting the effect of current prophylactic vaccines [10] and
forming the basic for the second-generation vaccines
targeted to specific regions.
Since March 2009, a randomized, double-blind trial
testing the safety and efficacy of the quadrivalent vaccine (Gardasil®, Merck) in Chinese women (V501-04100) was conducted in Zhejiang Province, a coastal
region in southeast China. To the best of our knowledge, no epidemiologic data on HPV genotypes in general female population were reported from Zhejiang
Province, which highlights the need for timely population-based study in this region. Due to the feasible anatomic site for sampling and the well-established
sampling method for cervix, here, we investigated the
cervical HPV infection in asymptomatic general female
population to be conscious of the overall, type-specific
and age-specific HPV prevalence, as well as determinants of HPV infection, in Zhejiang Province before
large scale vaccination programs occur.

Methods
Study population and inclusion criteria

A total of 7500 women were randomly selected as candidates between November 2007 and August 2008
from the population list of five randomly chosen counties. These five counties are located in east, south,
west, north and middle part of Zhejiang Province,
respectively. In each county, one town and one village
were randomly selected, and 1500 women (750 town
and 750 village residents, respectively) were randomly
recruited to ensure geographical and social diversity. A
woman was eligible to be study objective if she: (a)
was mentally and physically competent; (b) was aged
between 20 and 79 years; (c) was a permanent resident
of local area; (d) had no history of abnormal cytology
or cervico-vaginal dysplasia; (e) had no abnormal vaginal bleeding and contact bleeding; (f) had no visual
cervical lesions at simple visual inspection during
gynecological examination; (g) had no history and
associated symptoms of other HPV-related diseases;
(h) was not a virgin; (i) was not presently pregnant; (j)
had not undergone a total hysterectomy; (k) had no
use of vaginal medication and no sexual intercourse in
the previous three days. Eligible women were invited

for a face-to-face interview and a gynecological examination in local hospitals.
Of these 7500 enumerated women, 247 stayed away
from home at interview time, 376 did not meet the
inclusion criteria, 317 could not undergo gynecological
examination because of menstruation, and 1502 refused
to participate mainly because they did not have enough
time or did not think they needed gynecological examination in the absence of symptoms. Totally 5058
women were enrolled into the study.
All participants agreed to participate in the present
study and signed informed consent forms. The study
project was approved by The Human Research Ethical
Committee of Women’s Hospital, School of Medicine,
Zhejiang University.
Questionnaire interview

An interviewer-administrated structured questionnaire
was designed to collect information on socio-demographic characteristics, lifestyle, menstrual status, reproductive history, contraception and sexual behavior.
Trained research nurses questioned participants face-toface in the local dialect of Chinese.
Cervical specimen collection

Samples of exfoliated cervical cells were collected with
DNAPap cervical sampler (Digene) during gynecological
examinations. The sampler was inserted 1-1.5 cm into
the endocervical canal and rotated 3-5 full turns in
counterclockwise direction. The tip containing cellular
material was then placed into transport medium tube
and stored at 4°C immediately. All specimens were
coded without knowledge of the subjects.
HPV detection

HPV DNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform,
resuspended in 100 μL elution buffer, and stored at
-30176;C. The quality and integrity of sample DNA for
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was verified by amplification of a 268 base pair region of the human b-globin
gene [11]. Specimens with negative internal control
amplification were excluded. All the b-globin-positive
samples were amplified with the MY09/11 L1 consensus
primers of anogenital HPV genotypes [12] and synchronously detected with the commercially introduced HPV
GenoArray Test kit (Hybribio). All the MY09/11 consensus PCR-positive/GenoArray-negative samples were
typed with an improved PCR-restriction fragment length
polymorphism (RFLP) assay validated by Hybrid Capture
II and sequencing [13]. Approximately 7.5% MY09/11
consensus PCR-positive/GenoArray-positive samples
and 10% MY09/11 consensus PCR-RFLP typed samples
were randomly selected to be validated by sequencing.
More than 5% MY09/11 consensus PCR-negative/

GenoArray-negative samples were randomly selected to
be validated by Real Time PCR HPV Detection Kit
(Hybribio).
PCR

PCR was performed in 50 μL reaction mixture containing 10× PCR buffer, 25 mM MgCl2, 200 μM deoxynucleotide triphosphate, 2 U Taq polymerase, 10 pmol of
each primer, and 5 μL template DNA. The PCR protocol was: preheating at 94°C for 7 min, followed by 36
cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 45 sec, annealing at
56°C for 45 sec, and extension at 72°C for 45 sec, at last
a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. Products were
identified by electrophoresis in 2.0% agarose gel stained
with ethidium bromide. For every PCR assay, a negative
control and a positive control (HPV DNA from SiHa)
were run to control for possible contamination and
accuracy.
HPV GenoArray Test

HPV GenoArray Test kit makes use of both DNA
amplification and Hybribio’s proprietary Flow-through
Hybridization Technology to simultaneously identify 21
HPV genotypes: HPV-6, -11, -16, -18, -31, -33, -35, -39,
-42, -43, -44, -45, -51, -52, -53, -56, -58, -59, -66, -68
and -81 (equivalent to CP8304). The test employs a
gene chip with a nylon membrane onto which type-specific oligonucleotides probes have been immobilized.
The final results were detected by colorimetric change
on the chip under direct visualization. Test was performed according to the manufacture’s instructions.

epidemiologic classification associated with cervical cancer, HPV-16, -18, -31, -33, -35, -39, -45, -51, -52, -56,
-58, and -59 were classified as established high-risk
(HR) types, HPV-26, -53, -66, -68, -73 and -82 were
classified as probably HR types, and HPV-6, -11, -40,
-42, -43, -44, -54, -61, -70, -72, -81 and -89 (equivalent
to CP6108) were classified as established low-risk (LR)
types [1,3]. All other HPV types were considered as
undetermined risk HPV types. Analyses were repeated
by grouping HPV types according to phylogeny [1,14].
Statistical analysis

Data were key-entered twice and analyzed using SPSS
software for Windows (version 16.0). The c2 test and,
where appropriate, Fisher’s exact test were used to compare HPV prevalence across age groups. Odds ratios
(ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using unconditional logistic regression to estimate
independent predictors for HPV infection. Analyses
were performed for overall, established HR, established
LR, single-type and multiple-type HPV infection, respectively. Age group and variables associated with HPV
positivity in age-adjusted model were included as candidates in multivariate model. Final model was determined
by forward elimination of candidate variables based on
likelihood ratio tests. In all of the logistic models, HPVnegative women were used as the reference group. All
hypotheses testing were two-sided. A level of 0.05 was
chosen to indicate statistical significance.

Genotyping by RFLP

The products generated by MY09/11 L1 consensus primers were typed with RFLP as described by Hong et al.
[13].
Sequencing

MY09/11 consensus PCR-amplified products were
sequenced in the 3730 ABI Prism sequencer (Applied
Biosystems). The obtained sequences were compared to
known HPV sequence databases (available at: http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/).

Results
HPV genotyping algorithm

Of 5058 women who provided cervical cell samples, 71
were excluded because of negative b-globin. In the leaving 4987 samples, 615 (12.3%) were HPV GenoArraypositive and 591 (11.9%) were MY09/11 consensus PCRpositive. There was a 97.5% overall agreement between
these two assays (kappa = 0.883; P < 0.001). Figure 1
shows the detailed HPV genotyping algorithm.

Real Time PCR HPV Detection

Real Time PCR HPV Detection kit detects 13 HPV
types (HPV-16, -18, -31, -33, -35, -39, -45, -51, -52, -56,
-58, -59 and -68) in one single reaction by real-time
PCR equipment. Test was performed according to the
manufacture’s instructions.
Definition and estimation

Positive result by any assay mentioned above was
regarded as HPV positive. For samples inconsistent
between HPV GenoArray Test and sequencing, the genotypes were identified according to sequencing. Multiple-type infection was separated into constituent types,
thus type-specific prevalence included that in both
single-type and multiple-type infection. Based on

Epidemiological distribution of HPV types

In 4987 detected cervical samples, 665 (13.3%) were
HPV positive. The corresponding prevalence, age-standardized to the world population, were 13.5% overall. Of
these 665 positive samples, 508 (76.4%) were established
HR-HPV and 176 (26.5%) were multiple-type HPV
infections. Totally 35 different genotypes, grouped in 11
alpha species, were identified. The five most prevalent
types were HPV-52 (3.1%), HPV-16 (2.5%), HPV-58
(2.1%), HPV-68 (1.0%) and HPV-81 (0.9%) (Table 1).
Stratified with counties, the most prevalent types in east
county were HPV-52 (37/1003, 3.7%), HPV-58 (27/1003,
2.7%), HPV-16 (17/1003, 1.7%), HPV-68 (9/1003, 0.9%),
HPV-51 (7/1003, 0.7%) and HPV-53 (7/1003, 0.7%); in

prevalence for categories of HPV infection. There were
two peaks of established HR-HPV infection. The first
was 14.5% in women 20-24 years old and the second
was 14.4% in women 50-54 years old (c2 = 15.166, P =
0.034) (Figure 1A). Similar pattern was observed for
probably HR-HPV infection (c 2 = 15.901, P = 0.026),
while overall and established LR-HPV infection showed
relatively flat curves (c2 = 12.284, P = 0.092 and c2 =
6.821, P = 0.448, respectively) (Figure 1A). The age-specific curves for alpha-9 (c2 = 12.998, P = 0.072) and -6
(c2 = 15.214, P = 0.033) were similar to the established
HR and probably HR-HPV infection, with two peaks,
while the curves for alpha-7 (c2 = 2.944, P = 0.890) and
3 (c 2 = 9.898, P = 0.194) were more flat (Figure 1B).
The prevalence for HPV-16 or-18 and for HPV-6, -11,
-16 or -18 showed no significant differences across age
groups.
Risk profile for HPV Infection

In age-adjusted models, no significant associations were
found between HPV positivity and smoking, income, age
at menarche, age at marriage, reproductive history, condom or intrauterine device use as the main contraceptive method in the recent two years, history of
malignancy, history of subtotal hysterectomy and history
of Papanicolaou screening (data not shown). In multivariate models, marital status, residence, passive smoking, menstrual cycle, outcome of initial pregnancy, oral
contraceptive use as the main contraceptive method in
the recent two years, age at sexual initiation and lifetime
number of sexual partners were eliminated from the
final models. The independent predictors for overall,

established HR, established LR, single-type and multiple-type HPV infection were listed in Table 2, respectively. Partner’s lifetime number of partners was the
only shared predictor for all categories of HPV infection
(Table 2).

Discussion
To date, no type-specific HPV testing is approved by the
Food and Drug Administration or is used widely. HPV
GenoArray-test, which has already been used for quite a
while in European and Asian countries, showed high
level agreement (97.5%) with MY09/11 consensus PCR
system. The concordance of HPV GenoArray-test with
Amplicor HPV test [15] or Roche Linear Array [16] was
also reported to be excellent. Considering that HPV
GenoArray-test could not identify genotypes not
included in gene chip, we utilized an improved PCRRFLP technique for the MY09/11 consensus PCR-positive/GenoArray-negative samples.
Compared with similar studies in China, age-standardized HPV prevalence estimation in Zhejiang Province
(13.5%) was similar to that in a central rural area of
China (14.2%) [17], but lower than that in the largest
city in northeast China (16.6%) [18] and an urban city
in south China (17.6%) [19]. Although 1502 women
refused to participate, it may not cause large bias as
HPV infection is asymptomatic. HPV prevalence in
women without cervical abnormalities was estimated to
between 1.4% to 25.6% by country, and varied from
1.6% to 14.2% in Asia countries [10]. The population in
our study was asymptomatic women with no history of
cervical neoplasia or other HPV-related diseases. Based

on cost constraints, we did not perform the Bethesda
System Terminology based cytology for participants in
this study. On the one hand, it may actually help better
estimate HPV burden in the general female population
in this region. On the other hand, inclusion of women
with abnormal cytology (mainly mild ones) did not
materially affect significant findings [10,19-21], which
made our findings comparable with other investigations.
The five most common HPV types in general female
population worldwide were HPV-16, -18, -31, -58 and
-52, while the rank varied by region [22]. Contrasting to
most previous surveys in China [17-19] and other

populations [22], HPV-52, rather than HPV-16, was the
most commonly identified type in our population, consistent with the data from Japan and Taiwan and eastern
Africa [22]. HPV-16 ranked the second and the prevalence (2.5%) was comparable with that worldwide [22].
HPV-58, another common type in Asian population
[23,24], ranked the third (15.9% of all infections), similar
to that in South Taiwan (19.9% of all infections in general population) [24]. The finding that HPV-52 was
more prevalent than HPV-16 may be due to the geographical and biological interplay between HPV types or
variants and host immunogenic factors [25]. Another

Ye et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:66
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/66

interpretation attributed to the genotyping system. On
the one hand, with HPV GenoArray-test kit, Lin et al.
[26] found that HPV-52 and -58 were the most prevalent genotypes in Chinese women in Guangdong Province, while Grisaru et al. [15] found the relatively high
percentage of HPV-52 in Israeli Jewish women referred
for colposcopic examination. On the other hand, Liu
et al. [16] reported that HPV GenoArray-test had an
analytical sensitivity in detection of HPV-16 and -18 in
as few as 10-50 copies. Larger and comprehensive studies are warranted to further evaluate the performance
of HPV GenoArray-test, however, the preponderance of
HPV-52 and -58 in our study population is meaningful.
As accumulated studies had shown that HPV-52 and
-58 were more predominant in Asian populations
[10,17-19,27] and overrepresented in cervical cancer
cases from eastern and southeastern Asia [13,28,29], we
assume that the second-generation HPV prophylactic
vaccines including HPV-52 and -58 may offer higher
protection for women in China and other Asian areas.
For the current available prophylactic vaccines, the
prevalence of vaccine types was consistently low across
age groups. Since a proportion of older women might
have already been infected and cleared previous infections, the actually exposed rate to vaccine types might
be higher than observed in older women. Considering
that HPV prophylactic vaccines do not have clinical
benefit in women who have been infected with vaccine
types at the time of vaccination, we assume that younger
women would draw more benefit from “catch-up” HPV
vaccination programs.
Bimodal age distribution of HR-HPV, which was not
common in mainland China [17,18,26], was observed in
the current study. Viral prevalence is the product of
incidence, persistence and clearance of infection. As
HPV is often acquired soon after sexual initiation [30],
the actual first peak of HR-HPV infection might before
20 years old, due to the higher probability of exposure
to new HPV infections and the lack of adaptive immune
responses in younger women. The second peak observed
in perimenopausal women may be partly explained by
viral persistence or reactivation of latent HPV due to
the physiologic and immunologic dysregulation caused
by hormone fluctuations at menopausal transition [31].
Another interpretation attributes to changes in the sexual behavior of women or their partners in middle age.
Considering that only HR-HPV, which had a higher tendency to cause persistent infection [32,33], showed the
second peak around menopause, we assume that persistence or reactivation of latent HPV may better explain
the second peak in our population. Castle et al. also
suggested a stronger role for viral persistence than for
acquisition of new infections in women aged 45 years or
older in Costa Rica [34]. Accordingly, HR-HPV

Page 9 of 11

positivity around the age of menopause implies more
possibility of viral persistence, which makes HPV
screening have more important clinical meaning for
perimenopausal women than for young women. For
perimenopausal women with positive HR-HPV, further
evaluation, including cytology and even colposcopy,
should be considered and regular screening should be
prolonged because they have higher risk for the development of cervical cancer.
Alpha-6, -7, -9 species comprised mainly of established HR and probably HR-HPV types, while alpha-3
species comprised mainly of established LR-HPV types.
However, alpha-7 species were more closely genetically
related to alpha-3 than to alpha-9 species [35]. Consistently, the age-related curves for alpha-7 and alpha-3
species were similar. The difference of age curves
between alpha-3/7 species and alpha-6/9 species may be
a reflection for different tropisms for cervical columnar
epithelium. According to Castle et al., the age-related
changes in cervix influence HPV type-specific detection
at the cervical os, where cervical specimens are routinely
collected [35]. What is more, diverse patterns also exist
among different populations with regard to the same
species [21,35]. Whether it is due to the diversity in the
physiologic change of cervix among different populations, or it could be explained by variants which may
have subtle differences in tropism and other biological
behaviors, is unclear.
We also explored the independent predictors for categories of HPV positivity. Previous studies showed that
high-risk sexual behavior, including early sexual initiation, multiple sexual partners and sexual partner as an
HPV carrier, was the pivotal determinant for HPV infection among women [36-38]. However, less independent
indicators related with sexual behavior was found in our
study, except for partner’s lifetime number of partners,
which might be due to traditional habitude, especially in
oriental countries. Furthermore, our finding suggest that
in areas where women’s sexual conception and behavior
are conservative, men possessing multiple sexual partners may be a predominant resource for HPV positivity
in women as long as HPV is mainly transmitted through
sexual intercourse [39].

Conclusions
This study provides a unique opportunity to gather
baseline data on cervical HPV prevalence, as well as predictors concerned, in general female population in Zhejiang Province, southeast China. The data showed low
prevalence of HPV vaccine types and relatively high prevalence of HPV-52 and -58. Our findings support universal “catch-up” vaccination of sexual experienced
young women in this region, as well as enhance the
hypothesis that the second-generation HPV prophylactic

Ye et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:66

vaccines including HPV-52 and -58 may offer higher
protection for women in China and other Asian areas.
Furthermore, our data also support close surveillance of
perimenopausal women with HR-HPV infection.
