Abstract
Background: Highly pathogenic mycobacteria like Mycobacterium tuberculosis are characterised by
their slow growth and their ability to reside and multiply in the very hostile phagosomal
environment and a correlation between the growth rate of mycobacteria and their pathogenicity
has been hypothesised. Here, porin genes from M. fortuitum were cloned and characterised to
address their impact on the growth rate of fast-growing and pathogenic mycobacteria.
Results: Two genes encoding porins orthologous to MspA from M. smegmatis, porM1 and porM2,
were cloned from M. fortuitum strains, which were originally isolated from human patients. Both
porin genes were at least partially able to complement the mutations of a M. smegmatis mutant
strain lacking the genes mspA and mspC with respect to the growth rate. PorM1 and porM2 were
present in different strains of M. fortuitum including the type strain. Comparative expression analysis
of porM genes revealed divergent porin expression among analysed M. fortuitum strains. Repression
of the expression of porins by antisense technique decreased the growth rates of different M.
fortuitum. The effects of over-expression of porM1 as well as porM2 varied depending on the strain
and the concentration of antibiotic added to the medium and indicated that PorM1 and PorM2
enhance the growth of M. fortuitum strains, but also the diffusion of the antibiotic kanamycin into
the cells.
Conclusion: This study demonstrates the important role of porin expression in growth as well as
antibiotic susceptibility of the opportunistic bacterium M. fortuitum.

Background
Mycobacterium is considered a diverse genus with highly
pathogenic members like M. tuberculosis or M. leprae as
well as less pathogenic, opportunistic and saprophytic
species belonging to the so-called rapidly growing myco-

bacteria (RGM). The species of RGM able to cause human
disease basically belong to the M. fortuitum group, the M.
chelonae/abscessus group and the M. smegmatis group.
Members of these groups are commonly seen in aquatic
environments like municipal tap water, and health carePage 1 of 17

associated outbreaks are often associated with contact to
tap water or water sources such as ice.
The M. fortuitum group includes three taxa: M. fortuitum,
M. peregrinum and a third biovariant complex. The M. fortuitum group is involved in 60% of localised cutaneous
infections in immunocompetent persons caused by RGM
but is a rare cause of pulmonary disease. Most or all of the
cases of community-acquired or health care-associated
diseases caused by the M. fortuitum group are due to M.
fortuitum. This species basically causes skin lesions,
wound infections, postinjection abscesses, postsurgical
wound infections or pulmonary disease in previously
healthy hosts [1]. Little is known about the virulence
mechanisms and persistence of this human pathogen.
However, Cirillo et al. [2] and Da Silva et al. [3] reported
that M. fortuitum was capable to replicate in amoebae and
murine monocytic cells, respectively.
In a previous study, we showed that the intracellular survival of M. smegmatis depended on the amount of porins
in the mycobacterial outer membrane (OM). The mutant
strain ML10 of M. smegmatis, which lacks the porins MspA
and MspC [4], exhibited significantly enhanced intracellular survival compared to the parental strain SMR5 [5].
MspA belongs to a novel class of mycobacterial OM proteins present in many RGM but apparently absent in
slowly growing mycobacteria [6]. The main porin of M.
smegmatis, MspA, is an extremely stable octameric protein
composed of 20 kDa monomers [7] and provides the
uptake of hydrophilic nutrients across the extraordinarily
restricting mycobacterial OM [7,8]. By means of DNA
hybridisations using a probe derived from the mspA
sequence, Niederweis and colleagues [6] indicated that
the genome of M. fortuitum contained orthologous porin
genes.

Results
In order to verify the taxonomic classification and to
define the phylogenetic relationship between the strains
analysed, complete sequences of the 16S rRNA genes were
determined using the primers, which were described by
Adekambi and Drancourt [10]. The phylogenetic analysis
of the 16S rRNA sequences confirmed the taxonomic classification of the M. fortuitum strains employed (data not
shown).
Comparison of growth rates of the employed strains was
performed in broth by measuring the ATP content of the
cultures. Compared to other methods for growth measurements such as OD-measurement, cfu-counting or
quantification of DNA, the quantification of the ATP-content has the advantage of not being biased by clumping of
cultures or by inability of viable bacteria to grow on agar
if plated from a broth culture or by occurrence of dead
bacteria. We therefore chose this method for the comparison of the growth rates of the three strains. However, the
ATP content of bacteria may vary depending on their
physiological state and it therefore has to be considered as
a surrogate growth marker. As shown in Figure 1 (also see
Additional file 1), strain 10851/03 only grew very poorly,
while strains 10860/03 and DSM 46621 multiplied
strongly from day ten until day 14 or until day 15, respectively.
PorM genes of M. fortuitum are orthologs of mspA
To detect porin genes orthologous to mspA in M. fortuitum,
preliminary hybridisation experiments were performed

Since the saprophytic bacterium M. smegmatis causes disease only in rare cases [1] and shows a very limited intracellular persistence [5], it is important to investigate the
role of porins on virulence in pathogenic members of
RGM, which are able to multiply intracellularly. M. fortuitum was suggested to be a suitable model Mycobacterium
[9]. Like M. tuberculosis, it resides intracellularly in vacuoles restricting interferon--induced nitric oxide production and limits the maturation of phagosomes [3].
Therefore, M. fortuitum was chosen to detect and characterise porins and to analyse their impact first on extracellular growth and in a later stage on intracellular growth.
For this purpose, we used two different M. fortuitum
strains (10851/03 and 10860/03) that originally were isolated from human patients. Comparative analysis was performed using also the type strain M. fortuitum DSM
46621.

smegmatis mspA (accession no.: AJ001442) using the primers hpor and npor (Table 1) covering nucleotide 8 to 697.
The probe hybridised to the genomic DNA from M. fortuitum strains (data not shown). Thus, orthologs seem to
exist in all strains analysed.
To clone porin genes from M. fortuitum, genomic DNA of
M. fortuitum 10860/03 was digested with SacII, and a
3000 bp fragment, which hybridised to the probe, was
cloned in pIV2 and transformed into E. coli. Two clones
(pSSp107 and pSSp108) containing porin sequences were
isolated. Both plasmids were found to contain the same
genomic region of 2895 bp, harbouring one porin gene.
The inserts were sequenced by primer walking. Both
strands of the porin genes and 400 bp of surrounding
regions were sequenced at least twice. As shown in Figure

2A, the insert of the plasmids contained several open reading frames (ORFs), one of which was an ortholog of mspA.
It contained 636 bp, encoding a protein of 211 amino
acids with an N-terminal signal sequence of 27 amino
acids, which was predicted using the SignalP 3.0 Server at
http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/[11]. The in silico
analysis of the mature PorM1 (protein without signal peptide) showed a calculated molecular weight of the monomer of 19400 Da and an isoelectric point (pI) of 4.31.
A hypothetical -10 region of a promoter and a ribosome
binding site (RBS) were identified upstream of the coding
sequence. Downstream of the ORF a hairpin sequence was
detected, which might function as a terminator (Figure
2A). It has to be noted that the sequence similarity
between M. fortuitum and M. smegmatis was only restricted

Section A shows a 2895 bp region representing the insert of plasmid pSSp107. The insert includes the porM1 gene and three
other ORFs. Up- and downstream to porM1 various nucleotide signal sequences were detected: -10 signal of a promoter
(TATGTT), a ribosome binding site (RBS: GGAGA), a signal peptide recognition sequence (SP) of 81 bp and a hairpin structure, which could represent a terminator. Furthermore, the location of the antisense fragment selected for the generation of
plasmid pSRr106 is indicated. Section B represents a 1697 bp region of M. fortuitum 10851/03 containing porM2 and two other
ORFs. Upstream to porM2 a -10 signal of a promoter (TACGTT), a ribosome binding site (AGGGAGAA) and a signal peptide
recognition sequence (SP) of 93 bp were identified. Subsequences were predicted using the software packages MacVector™

to the coding sequence. According to the designation of
other mycobacterial porin genes and to the instructions of
EMBL nucleotide sequence database, the gene was named
porM1 (see Table 2 for accession no.).
Besides the porin gene, two other complete ORFs and part
of another ORF were detected. ORF1 was interrupted by
one of the SacII sites and showed a high similarity to a
molybdopterin biosynthesis protein of M. tuberculosis
CDC 1551 (accession no.: AAK 45260). ORF2 turned out
to be a mechanosensitive channel orthologous to the gene
mscL from M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis str. 10 (accession no.: NP 959854). ORF3 was similar to the hypothet-

ical protein Rv0990c from M. tuberculosis H37Rv
(accession no.: NP 215505). The entire cloned genomic
region was blasted against the M. tuberculosis genome
from
the

Institute
database
http://

m_tuberculosis to examine if the whole region is conserved between M. fortuitum and M. tuberculosis. However,
only ORF1 and ORF2 possessed nucleotide identities
higher than 60% showing that the region is not conserved
among these mycobacteria.
A new probe derived from the porM1 sequence was used
to detect porin genes in different M. fortuitum strains. The

probe hybridised to two fragments of the SacII-digested
genomic DNA of different M. fortuitum strains. However,
the fragment size differed among different strains (Figure
3). Hence, the M. fortuitum genomes contain at least two
porin genes.

The amino acid sequences of PorM1 among the M. fortuitum strains 10851/03 and 10860/03 including the type
strain were identical (Figure 4). The mature PorM1 from
M. fortuitum featured six amino acid substitutions compared to MspA.

Next, the presence of porM1 in other M. fortuitum strains
was analysed. For this purpose, the porM1-specific primers
komf-3f and komf-4b (Figure 2A and Table 1) were chosen to amplify a fragment of approximately 1250 bp, comprising the porM1 gene and its flanking regions. PCRs
using a polymerase-mix with proofreading activity generated a fragment of the expected size in all strains. Several
PCRs were performed and both strands of the different
fragments were sequenced. PorM1 was detected in all
three M. fortuitum strains, and the nucleotide sequences
were submitted to the EMBL nucleotide sequence database (Table 2). The nucleic acid subsequences such as the
-10 signal of a promoter, the RBS, the signal peptide of 81
bp and the hairpin structure were also present and were
conserved among all strains tested (data not shown). As
already indicated in Table 2, the nucleotide sequences of
the gene porM1 differed among different strains of M. fortuitum.

Since the southern blot experiments had indicated the
existence of two genes orthologous to mspA in M. fortuitum, we also attempted to clone and characterise the second porin gene. This porin gene, termed porM2, was
amplified by PCR and cloned as a 918 bp fragment into
the mycobacterial vectors pMV306 and pMV261, as
described in the section Methods. The corresponding
recombinant plasmids were named pSRa104 and
pSRb103, respectively. Positive clones were confirmed by
sequencing. As shown in Figure 2B, the insert of the plasmids contained an ORF of 648 bp, which turned out to be
paralogous to the gene porM1. The 648 bp ORF encodes a
protein of 215 amino acids with an N-terminal signal
sequence of 31 amino acids, which was predicted using
the SignalP 3.0 Server at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/
SignalP/[11]. The in silico analysis of the mature PorM2
showed a calculated molecular weight of the monomer of
19374 Da and a pI of 4.31, which were very similar to the
calculated values of PorM1. A hypothetical -10 promoter
sequence and a hypothetical RBS were located upstream
of porM2. A hypothetical terminator sequence was, however, not detected (Figure 2B). The similarity between
porM1 and porM2 from strains M. fortuitum 10851/03 and
10860/03 on nucleotide level amounted to 94.1% and
95.3%, respectively. The mspA gene revealed to be more
similar to porM1 (87.4% to 88.4% similarity) than to
porM2 (86.5% similarity). Sequence comparison revealed
that porM2 encodes a protein mainly differing from porM1
within the signal sequence. PorM2 from M. fortuitum
10851/03 and 10860/03 exhibits an insertion of four
amino acids and additional six amino acid exchanges
within the signal peptide compared to PorM1 (Figure 4).
Only one amino acid is replaced in the mature polypeptide [proline165 (PorM1) with alanine169 (PorM2)]. We
sequenced a 1697 bp region comprising porM2, 500 bp of
its upstream region as well as 549 bp downstream of
porM2. The DNA sequences flanking the porM1 and porM2
genes revealed no similarity with exception of the 13 bp
preceding the porM-coding sequences, which were identical in both regions. The 5' terminus of an ORF orthologous to a glycosyl transferase gene from M. tuberculosis
CDC1551 (accession no.: AAK 48256) was detected
upstream from porM2. An ORF orthologous to the gene
for a pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate oxidase-related protein
from M. vanbaalenii (accession no.: ZO 01208463) was
present in the downstream region of porM2 (Figure 2B).

was predicted for PorM1, PorM2 and MspC using the SignalP 3.0 Server at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/[11]. The
predicted signal peptide cleavage sites corresponded to the signal peptide cleavage site of MspA [6]. Identical amino acids are
dark grey, similar amino acids are light grey and different amino acids are not shaded. For PorM1 and MspA an identity index of
94.8% was calculated, while PorM2 showed an amino acid identity of 90.7% to MspA.

was also detected in other strains analysed. No product
was obtained using the plasmid pSSp107 carrying porM1
as template, demonstrating the specificity of this PCR
approach for porM2.
M. fortuitum strains express less porin compared to M.
smegmatis
The expression of the porins PorM1 and PorM2 were
examined by 2D-Electrophoresis, Western Blotting, ELISA
and qRT-PCR. For porin protein analysis, M. fortuitum pellets were lysed in POP05 (PBS 0.5% (w/v) n-octylpolyoxyethylene/0.2% EDTA) that was shown to selectively
extract MspA [12]. For enhanced resolution and characterisation of the proteins, porin preparations were subjected
to 2D-Electrophoresis. As shown in Figure 5A, about 50
protein spots were detected on the 2D-gel in M. fortuitum
POP05 cell extracts. Western blot experiments with identical gels showed only one defined spot detected by the
antiserum pAK MspA#813 [6] (see Additional file 2). The
protein had an apparent molecular mass of approximately
120 kDa, the expected size of the oligomeric porin, and an
apparent pI of about 4, which corresponded well to the
predicted pI of the mature protein of 4.31. Oligomers of
the porin were readily detected in cell extracts of all M. for-

tuitum strains as well as in extracts from M. smegmatis that
served as a positive control. After extended exposition
times, the monomer of the porin was also detected on
Western Blots (data not shown). The Western Blots
showed considerable differences in porin protein expression among the analysed strains (see Additional file 3).
Additionally, ELISA experiments with POP05 extracts
were performed to quantify the amount of porin in different strains. Different dilutions of cell extracts from the various strains were loaded into the wells of a microtiter plate
and porins were detected using the polyclonal antibody
pAK MspA#813. Since M. bovis BCG does not possess
orthologous porins [6], extracts of M. bovis BCG were
employed as a control to detect the background. Amounts
higher than 5 g per well turned out to be inapplicable
due to saturation effects, and the detection of porin in cell
extracts failed at concentrations of about 0.04 g per well.
Therefore, the most eligible working range turned out to
be 1 g of cell extract per well. Indeed, the amount of
porin differed in various strains. The highest amount of
porin was detected in the internal control M. smegmatis
SMR5. The type strain M. fortuitum DSM 46621 exhibited
porin amounts close to those of M. smegmatis, whereas the
other two strains showed clearly decreased porin amounts

Detection of PorMs in M. fortuitum and M. smegmatis. 2D-Electrophoresis, Western Blot, ELISA and qRT-PCR
experiments proved PorMs to be expressed in the analysed strains. Section A shows 2D-Electrophoresis of protein

Western Blot analysis (see Additional file 2). Section B and C show comparative analysis of porin expression among RGM.
Expression of porin was detected by means of ELISA (B) and qRT-PCR (C). Each value represents the mean (± SD) of at least
three independent experiments. B: Quantification of porin by means of ELISA in cell extracts of different mycobacteria using

(Figure 5B). Notably, M. fortuitum 10851/03 exhibited the
lowest amount of porin very close to the background,
which was represented by the control M. bovis BCG.
Comparative expression analysis was also performed by
means of quantitative reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction (qRT-PCR) using sequence-specific primers
and probes (Table 1). The values were compared to porin
expression in M. smegmatis. Because of the high degree of
sequence conservation of the two paralogs porM1 and
porM2, a qRT-PCR approach was established using primers and a dually labelled probe that hybridised to a region
where both genes are identical (porM1 amplicon: nucleotide 132–232 and porM2 amplicon nucleotide 144–244,

see also Table 1). This PCR approach enabled the quantification of the overall expression of the paralogs. As was
already proven by the ELISA results, the highest porin
mRNA expression was measured in M. smegmatis. It
showed transcription rates about twice as high as the highest level among the M. fortuitum strains, which was
detected in the type strain M. fortuitum DSM 46621. M.
fortuitum 10851/03 exhibited the lowest transcription rate
among all M. fortuitum strains (Figure 5C). The quantification of porM mRNA as well as the protein isolated from
the various strains demonstrated consistence of transcriptional and translational levels and underlined the differential porin expression among the analysed M. fortuitum
strains.

MspA was shown to be accessible on the cell surface of M.
smegmatis by using pAK MspA#813 [8]. Since the expression analysis showed a differing amount of porin in M.
fortuitum strains, M. fortuitum DSM 46621 and M. fortuitum 10860/03 (the strains with the highest porin expressions) were employed for detection of porins at the
surface of intact mycobacteria. Porins were accessible at
the surface of intact cells of M. fortuitum and were detected
by the porin-specific antibody. Significantly higher
absorption at 450 nm (P < 0.001) was measured for M.

when compared to the relative backgrounds (see Additional file 4).

PorM expression in the porin-deficient mutant strain M.

Heterologous expression of porM1 as well as porM2 was
performed in the porin mutant strain M. smegmatis ML10
(mspA; mspC) to prove the functionality of encoded
porins. For this purpose, the plasmids pSRa102 and
pSRa104 harbouring porM1 and porM2, respectively, were
introduced to M. smegmatis ML10. The plasmid pSSa100
[13] containing mspA was employed as a positive control.

The quantification of growth rates of the strains by cfucounting confirmed these conclusions (Figure 6E). The

The transformant complemented with porM1 (containing
pSRa102) also showed visible colonies after 72 hours, it

First, the growth on Mycobacteria agar plates was quantified during four days after electroporation. The growth
was compared to a strain harbouring only the vector
pMV306. As it is shown in Figure 6A to 6D, heterologous
expression of mspA, porM1 and porM2 led to enhanced
growth of complemented strains compared to the control.
Figure 6A and 6B illustrate the growth retardation of strain
M. smegmatis ML10 (pMV306) compared to the mspAcomplemented strain M. smegmatis ML10 (pSSa100). The
growth of M. smegmatis ML10 was ameliorated by both,
plasmid pSRa102 as well as plasmid pSRa104 (Figure 6C
and 6D), although the complementation of the growth
defect by these plasmids was less pronounced than by
mspA expression using pSSa100. Heterologous expression
of porM1 in the M. smegmatis mutant (Figure 6C) resulted
in better growth than heterologous expression of porM2
(Figure 6D).

Knock-down of porM expression by RNA antisense
technique as well as over-expression of porM1 or porM2
affect the growth rate of M. fortuitum
Knock-down of porin expression in M. fortuitum was performed by generating the plasmid pSRr106, which carries
a porM antisense fragment (see Figure 2A) under the control of the hsp60 promoter. The employed antisense

Page 8 of 17

BMC Microbiology 2009, 9:31

sequence was first tested for non-specific binding performing a blast search at http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
Blast.cgi. The analysis ensured that the antisense fragment
specifically binds to mspA class porins, such as porMs and
did not show any hits to other sequences deposited in the
database.
The efficiency of down-regulation via RNA antisense technique was proven by means of SYBR Green qRT-PCR
using strain 10860/03. As shown in Additional file 5, the
knock-down strain carrying the plasmid pSRr106 showed
about four times lower porin expression compared to the
control strain harbouring the vector pSHKLx1.
In order to over-express porM genes in M. fortuitum, the
coding sequences of porM1 from strain M. fortuitum
10851/03 and of porM2 from strain 10860/03 were
inserted downstream of the hsp60 promoter in the vector
pMV261 to generate plasmids pSRb101 and pSRb103,
respectively.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/31

We first studied the impact of the modified porM expression rates on the growth of bacteria freshly transformed
with plasmids pSRr106, pSRb101 and pSRb103 as well as
with the empty vectors pSHKLx1 and pMV261, serving as
negative controls. Strains transformed with pSHKLx1 or
pSRr106 were either selected by adding kanamycin (100
g ml-1) or hygromycin (100 g ml-1) to the agar, while
transformants electroporated with pMV261, pSRb101 or
pSRb103 were selected by addition of kanamycin (100 g
ml-1). The clearest results were obtained with strains
10851/03 and DSM 46621 and are displayed in Figure
7(A, B, C–E, F, G, H–K). Knock-down of porM expression
in both strains resulted in considerable growth reduction
(Figure 7A, B and 7F, G) substantiating an important role
of porins for the growth of M. fortuitum. This was further
supported by the growth pattern of the 10851/03 derivatives over-expressing porM1 or porM2 (Figure 7C–E).
Compared to 10851/03 containing the empty plasmid
pMV261, both derivatives over-expressing porM genes
brought about a slight increase in average colony size on
plates containing 100 g ml-1 kanamycin. This effect was

strains 10851/03 (A-E) and DSM 46621 (F-N) were electoprorated with plasmids pSHKLx1 (A, F), pSRr106 (B, G), pMV261 (C,
H, L), pSRb101 (D, I, M) or pSRb103 (E, K, N), plated on either 100 g ml-1 hygromycin (A, B), 100 g ml-1 kanamycin (C-K) or
25 g ml-1 kanamycin (L-N) and incubated for four days.

more pronounced in 10851/03 over-expressing porM2
than in the strain over-expressing porM1. In DSM 46621
the porin over-expression had an adverse effect on growth
upon plating on 100 g ml-1 kanamycin (Figure 7H–K). In
order to figure out if this growth decrease was caused by
an increased antibiotic uptake, we then plated the overexpressing DSM 46621 derivatives and the control on
plates containing only 25 g ml-1 kanamycin (Figure 7L–
N). Under these conditions, the over-expression of porM
genes slightly enhanced the growth. Again the increase in
average colony size was more pronounced upon overexpression of porM2.

Discussion
In recent studies, our research has concentrated on the
impact of the cell wall permeability on growth and intracellular persistence of mycobacteria. We were able to
show that the porin pathway affects the intracellular persistence of different species in different ways. The findings
suggest that intracellular persistence of mycobacteria
depends, inter alia, on the balance between "walling-off"
towards the hostile environment and the uptake of
required compounds in the nutrient-depleted phagosomal environment [5,13,14]. To further examine this
hypothesis, we are searching for more appropriate models. Different views have been expressed among scientists
about whether M. smegmatis could serve as an appropriate
model to study aspects related to virulence of highly pathogenic mycobacteria. A notable number of M. tuberculosis
genes that are related to virulence but also play a housekeeping role share closely related orthologs in M. smegmatis. In the case of common mycobacterial genes, M.
smegmatis was suggested as an appropriate model organism [15,16]. On the other hand, the physiological differences between M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis were
mentioned to narrow down the significance of direct comparisons [17]. Mutagenesis of porin genes in M. smegmatis
allows the investigation of the impact of cell wall permeability on persistence. However, more appropriate models
for such studies must naturally be able to survive and multiply intracellularly. Additionally, they must possess a
known class of porin. These conditions are fulfilled by M.
fortuitum, which was recently suggested as a model Mycobacterium [9]. This species is able to infect and grow in
phagocytic cells [2,3] and also possesses porins orthologous to MspA. We therefore decided to identify and characterise porin genes from M. fortuitum.
The results of this study show that different strains –
including the type strain – of M. fortuitum possess orthologous porins of the MspA class. The amino acid sequences
of PorM1 and PorM2 are highly conserved among the
strains, whereas there is variability in their nucleotide
sequence. PorM1 and PorM2 have the same apparent
molecular mass as MspA and MspC, respectively. They are

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/31

accessible at the surface of M. fortuitum. In detergent
extracts of M. fortuitum mature oligomers of PorMs were
detected, similar to M. smegmatis porin oligomers. As oligomer formation is necessary for channel activity [18], it
can be concluded that M. fortuitum porins form functional
pores in the OM. Mature PorM1 from M. fortuitum differs
at only six amino acid positions from MspA. According to
the studies of Faller et al. [7] and Mahfoud et al. [19] about
the structure of MspA and its topology in the OM of M.
smegmatis, it can be assumed that the amino acid replacements between PorM1 and MspA do not significantly
affect the general porin structure. Remarkably, most of the
exchanges are restricted to those residues, which are also
variable within the Msp family. For example, the replacement of alanine138 with proline in the extracellular loop
L9 between the -sheets 9 and 10 supports the tight turn
between the -sheets and the change of direction. Interestingly, PorM2 does not feature the mentioned exchange of
alanine with proline, which is the only amino acid
exchange in the mature protein between PorM1 and
PorM2. Faller et al. [7] proposed that the adjacent replacement of serine163 with lysine changes the antigenic properties of MspD compared to the other isomers. Although
PorMs have the same exchange, they were readily detectable using a polyclonal antibody raised against MspA. The
exchange of asparagine129 with glutamic acid within the
periplasmatic loop L6 introduces a negative charge into
the channel and may thus change the permeation properties slightly [7]. The replacement of isoleucine76 with threonine within the -sheet 3 should not affect the protein
structure either, since both amino acids are C-beta
branched amino acids and it is more favourable for them
to lie between -sheets [20].
The capacity of the encoded porins PorM1 and PorM2 to
fulfil the function of a porin was tested in complementation experiments by introducing these genes into the double mutant strain M. smegmatis ML10 (mspA; mspC) and
observing the growth rate. Interestingly, porM1 had a
stronger complementation effect than porM2, which was
indicated by faster appearance of colonies and larger colony sizes on plates after electroporation. This may be
explained by the higher similarity of porM1 to mspA,
which represents the main porin gene in M. smegmatis [8].
The antiserum raised against MspA binds well to PorMs,
and the growth defect of the mutant strain M. smegmatis
ML10 is reduced after complementation with porM1 and
porM2. All mentioned features indicate similar functions
and characteristics of the porins from M. smegmatis and M.
fortuitum.
As mentioned above, mature PorM2 only differs from the
mature PorM1 in one amino acid. More remarkable differences occur in the signal peptide of the two porins. The
calculated cleavage site (SHA-GL) of the signal peptides of

Page 10 of 17
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Microbiology 2009, 9:31

PorM1, PorM2, MspA and MspC is identical. However,
the length of the signal peptides differs. While PorM1 and
MspA have signal peptides composed of 27 amino acids,
PorM2 and MspC possess extended signal peptides consisting of 31 amino acids. The length and primary structure of the signal peptide could be important for the
transport and integration of the particular porin to the
mycobacterial OM. It will be very informative to analyse
the different regulation mechanisms determining the
importance of the two genes for growth under different
environmental conditions.
It was interesting that the expression of porM genes both
at the transcriptional level and at the translational level
consistently differed among the analysed strains as shown
by the three employed approaches (Western Blot, ELISA
and qRT-PCR). The results of both quantitative assays
show the lowest porin expression among M. fortuitum
strains in 10851/03 followed by 10860/03 and the type
strain. The use of a polyclonal antibody, which recognises
different epitopes of the protein and the consistency
among the results of three different approaches allows
drawing the conclusion that the porin expression in M.
fortuitum is lower compared to M. smegmatis and also varies between the different strains. The high sequence conservation of the two paralogs PorM1 and PorM2 does not
allow their expressions to be distinguished. Therefore, we
consider the expression rates as overall values of both paralogs. As shown by qRT-PCR and ELISA, the porin expression in different strains of M. fortuitum was significantly
lower than that of M. smegmatis. It was shown that M.
smegmatis possesses 1000 MspA-like pores per m2 cell
wall [21]. Since the analysed strains of M. fortuitum exhibited a clearly lower porM expression both at the transcriptional and the translational level, the amount of pores in
the cell wall of M. fortuitum must be distinctly lower than
1000 pores per m2 cell wall. According to our results, the
amount of MspA-like pores in the analysed strains of M.
fortuitum varies between 600 in M. fortuitum DSM 46621
and less than 100 per m2 cell wall in M. fortuitum 10851/
03, which exhibits the lowest amount of porin at all. It is
interesting that the strain exhibiting the lowest porin
expression is identical with the strain showing the slowest
growth rate. This finding supports the hypothesis that
porins play an important part in determining the generation time of mycobacteria.
To investigate the impact of the porins PorM1 and PorM2
on the growth rate of M. fortuitum, we generated strains
over-expressing porM1 or porM2. Additionally, M. fortuitum knock-down strains were generated by antisense technique. This technique has contributed to the clarification
of the function of many mycobacterial genes. Advantages
are the possibility to analyse essential genes whose mutagenesis would be lethal and to repress genes present in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/31

several copies. Some examples of the application of the
antisense technique in mycobacteria are the repression of
ahpC from M. bovis [22], dnaA from M. smegmatis [23],
FAP-P from M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis [24], pknF
from M. tuberculosis [25] or MDP1 from M. bovis BCG
[26]. A further advantage of knocking-down genes by antisense technique can be the possibility to repress paralogous genes in the same bacterium. As described in
Dryselius et al. [27], the most effective region for antisense
inhibition is the region covering the Shine-Dalgarno
Sequence and the start codon. The authors furthermore
show, that antisense RNAs of only 10–12 bases exhibit
strong inhibitory effects on gene expression. The antisense
fragment used in this study is identical to the corresponding region of porM1. While it displays a homology of
71.4% to porM2, the antisense fragment and porM2 still
exhibit long stretches of identical nucleic acid sequences.
Of particular importance is the similarity in the beginning
of the antisense fragment covering the Shine-Dalgarno
Sequence and the start codon (40 bp, 95% identity). We
therefore are convinced that a down-regulation of both,
porM1 as well as porM2, may be achieved using the strategy described in this study. Deletion- or insertion mutagenesis of either porM1 or porM2 might result in
complementation of the deleted porin gene by the
remaining one. Such an effect has been observed in M.
smegmatis, where the deletion of the mspA gene caused the
activation of the transcription of mspB and/or mspD [28].
Mutagenesis of both porin genes in the same derivative,
on the other hand, would probably restrain the diffusion
across the OM to an extent compromising cellular functions.
The effects of an over-expression of porin in our M. fortuitum strains depended on characteristics of the strains as
well as the amount of kanamycin added to the medium.
The over-expression of porM1 and porM2 showed the most
considerable influence on growth rate in strain 10851/03.
Among the tested strains, 10851/03 has the slowest
growth rate and produces least porin. Therefore, this
strain probably benefits most from a better nutrient supply caused by porin over-production. Otherwise, the
adverse effect of kanamycin on the growth rate was most
pronounced in strain DSM 46621, which expresses the
highest amount of porin among the analysed strains. Disposing of a relatively high amount of porin, this strain
probably takes less advantage of an ameliorated nutrient
supply and instead suffers most from more kanamycin
diffusion into the cells. When the kanamycin concentration in the plates was reduced to 25 g ml-1, the overexpressing DSM 46621 derivatives did not show any
growth inhibition compared to the control strain and
even had a slight growth advantage. It seems that at this
kanamycin concentration the beneficial effects of better
nutrient influx slightly exceed the adverse effects of better

antibiotic influx. The changes in growth behaviour in
10851/03 as well as in DSM 46621 were more pronounced upon over-expression of porM2 compared to
over-expression of porM1. The down-regulation of the
expression of PorM1 together with PorM2 by antisensetechnology reduced the growth of both M. fortuitum
strains to a similar and very low level suggesting that lack
of porins in the knock-down strains strongly impairs the
nutrient supply.
Our observations point to a passage of kanamycin
through the PorM porins. Studies performed with M.
smegmatis gave rise to contrarious conclusions [29,30].
Stephan et al. [29] observed no reduction of kanamycin
resistance in a mspA mutant compared to the M. smegmatis
wild type strain and Danilchanka and colleagues [30] had
postulated using structural models that due to its size kanamycin cannot diffuse through the MspA porin. These differing results may in part be explained by the use of
different experimental systems. Stephan et al. [29]
employed a mutant strain, while we observed differential
effects of kanamycin only in over-expressing strains. Furthermore, Stephan et al. [29] performed their studies with
M. smegmatis and we observed strong strain-dependent
variations even among different isolates within the same
species. The amino acid exchanges occurring between
MspA on the one hand and PorM1 and PorM2 on the
other hand may be responsible for differences in channel
properties of these porins and influence their permeability for kanamycin.

related actinomycete Streptomyces coelicolor. Brosch et al.
[34] reviewed different data such as 16S rRNA sequences
or genome sizes and suggested that the branch of slowgrowing mycobacteria represents the part of the genus that
has evolved most recently. They proposed that the loss of
genes rather than gain of genetic material by horizontal
transfer contributed both to the pathogenicity of slowgrowing mycobacteria and to the fine-tuning of their virulence. Loss of efficient porins of the MspA class or a
decreased density of porins in the OM plays an important
role to "wall-off" toward the hostile phagosomal environment and thus is of particular importance for the evolution of a successful intracellular pathogen. The presence of
several copies of porin genes and, in turn, a high density
of efficient porins in the OM of M. smegmatis would provide a selective advantage for saprophytes. A decreased
amount of efficient porins in the OM of pathogenic RGM
like M. fortuitum may represent an evolutionary intermediate stage between saprophytic mycobacteria like M.
smegmatis and the highly pathogenic slow-growing mycobacteria.

Conclusion
Our study provides detailed information about porin
genes of the mspA class in M. fortuitum and their importance for the growth rate and susceptibility to antibiotics.
Our future studies will concentrate on the elucidation of
the role of PorM1 and PorM2 in survival and replication
of phagocytosed M. fortuitum.

Methods
As we discussed earlier, the growth rate of mycobacteria
may contribute to their pathogenicity [14]. Hence, it can
be suggested that the low porin expression in M. fortuitum
strains isolated from human patients compared to saprophytic species of RGM like M. smegmatis contributes to
higher pathogenicity caused by an enhanced ability to
multiply intracellularly. Interestingly, it was shown that
the mspA expression in M. smegmatis is specifically downregulated at acidic pH [31]. Moreover, the M. tuberculosis
porin OmpATB, which belongs to the OmpA class of
porins has been shown to be necessary for the persistence
in the acidic milieu enabling M. tuberculosis to respond to
reduced environmental pH [32,33]. Although the MspA
like porins do not belong to the OmpA class of porins, the
results of these studies underline the role of porins concerning the intracellular persistence of mycobacteria.
An interesting result from various genome-sequencing
projects of mycobacteria is that genome sizes of RGM and
the pathogenic slow-growing mycobacteria largely differ.
Highly pathogenic species like M. tuberculosis and M. leprae have genome sizes of about 4.4 Mb and 3.27 Mb,
respectively. On the other hand, M. smegmatis has a
genome size of about 7 Mb, which is similar to that of the

Measurement of growth rates in broth culture
To compare the growth rates of M. fortuitum strains, Middlebrook 7H9/DC medium was inoculated with preparatory cultures to obtain an initial OD600 of 0.02. During 16
days, the optical densities of the cultures were measured
daily. Growth of the strains was monitored by quantification of the ATP content of the cultures with the luminescence-based kit BacTiter-Glo™ Microbial Cell Viability
Assay (Promega). The luminescence was reported as rela-

LB96V (EG&G Berthold) [36].
Molecular biology techniques and in silico analysis
Common molecular biology techniques were carried out
according to standard protocols [35] or according to the
recommendations of the manufacturers of kits and
enzymes. Transformation of E. coli was performed according to the method of Hanahan [37]. PCR reactions were
performed with the following kits: Taq DNA Polymerase
(MBI Fermentas, St. Leon-Roth, Germany), BC Advantage
GC Polymerase Mix (Takara Bio Europe S.A., Gennevilliers, France), BIO-X-ACT Short Mix and BIOTAQ DNA
Polymerase (Bioline GmbH, Luckenwalde, Germany).
Sequencing reactions were performed by using the Prism
Big Dye™ FS Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction
Kit from PE Applied Biosystems (Darmstadt, Germany).

Protein and nucleotide sequence analysis such as identification of DNA subsequences (e.g. promoters and terminators) was performed using the software packages
MacVector™ 7.2.3 (Accelrys, Cambridge, UK) and Lasergene (DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, WI, USA). Signal peptides were predicted using the SignalP 3.0 Server at http://
www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/[11].
Phylogenetic relationships among the RGM were analysed
using the program ClustalW in the MacVector™ 7.2.3
package. Before analysing the phylogenetic relationships,
sequences were trimmed in order to start and finish at the
same nucleotide position for all employed strains. Phylograms were obtained from nucleotide sequences using the
neighbour-joining method with Kimura 2-Parameter distance correction [38].
Cloning of porM1 and porM2 from M. fortuitum and
their detection in other strains of M. fortuitum
In order to clone porin genes, genomic DNA from M. fortuitum was digested to completion with the restriction
enzyme SacII and separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. The DNA was then transferred to the Hybond+ membrane (GE Healthcare, Munich, Germany) as described by
Sambrook and Russell [35]. Porin genes were detected by
means of Fluorescein-labelled probes using the primer

pairs hpor and npor or mf-4IV-fw and mf-4-bw (Table 1)
and the PCR Fluorescein Labelling Kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. The region around 3000 bp that was shown
to hybridise to the probe was isolated out of the gel and
was ligated into the unique SacII site of the plasmid pIV2
[39]. After transformation of E. coli DH5, clones were
screened by Dot Blot analysis. Inserts of two positive
recombinant plasmids, pSSp107 and pSSp108, were
sequenced. The inserts contained mspA-related sequences
referred to as porM1. Identification of orthologous genes
among other members of M. fortuitum was performed by
PCR using the primers komf-3f and komf-4b (Table 1),
which were derived from the cloned genomic region of
porM1.
For the cloning of porM2, genomic DNA from M. fortuitum
10851/03 DNA was digested with the restriction enzyme
SmaI and a 4200 bp SmaI fragment that had shown to
hybridise to the Fluorescein-labelled probe before was
eluted from the agarose gel and ligated into the SmaI site
of pLITMUS38 (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt, Germany) and clones were screened as mentioned above. The
insert of the only positive clone was sequenced. A 181 bp
sequence similar to the 3' terminus of the coding
sequence of porM1 was identified, while the following 256
bp of the 3' flanking region showed no similarity to the
porM1 flank. A PCR primer within the porM2 flanking
region (porM2-51-bw) and another primer hybridising to
the first 19 bp of the porM1 coding sequence (porM2-51fw) were used to amplify porM2 sequences (Table 1). After
sequencing the PCR product, a reverse PCR approach was
adapted to discover the 5' flanking region of porM2
including its start. Therefore, genomic DNA of M. fortuitum 10851/03 was digested with NcoI. The DNA fragments were circularised by ligation. Then a PCR was
performed using the reverse primers porM2-rev-1 and
porM2-rev-2 (Table 1) and the product was sequenced to
obtain a complete sequence of porM2 and its flanking
regions. The primers porM2-fw-hind (located 268 bp
upstream of the porM2 coding sequence [CDS]) and
porM2-bw-hpa (located directly downstream of the
porM2 cds) (Table 1) were derived from the sequence
mentioned and were chosen to amplify and clone porM2

and its regulatory sequences. The 918 bp product was
cloned into the HindIII/HpaI restriction sites of the integrative mycobacterial vector pMV306 [40] and the shuttle
vector pMV261 [40] to generate the recombinant plasmids pSRa104 and pSRb103, respectively. Positive clones
were verified by sequencing. PorM2 was detected in other
strains using the primer pairs porM2-fw-hind and porM2bw-hpa or porM2-rna-fw and porM2-rna-bw (Table 1).
Detection of porins by Western Blot and 2-D
Electrophoresis
M. smegmatis MspA as well as porins from M. fortuitum
were extracted in PBS buffer supplemented with 0.5% (w/
v) n-octylpolyoxyethylene (nOPOE, Bachem, Heidelberg)
and 0.2% EDTA (POP05), slightly modifying the method
of Heinz and Niederweis [12]. Mycobacteria were grown
to an OD600 of up to 1. Subsequently, about 150 mg of
mycobacteria (wet weight) were washed twice in PBS
buffer supplemented with 0.2% EDTA. Pellets were resuspended in POP05 using a ratio of 200 l POP05 per 100
mg mycobacteria and were incubated at 100°C for 30
min. Afterwards, cell debris was sedimented by centrifugation at 27,000 × g and 4°C and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. Quantification of protein samples
was carried out using the BCA Protein Assay Reagent Kit
(Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). Western Blot analysis was performed using the antiserum pAK MspA#813 as described
previously [13]. For 2D-analysis, about 75 g of protein
was precipitated by acetone and pellets were washed with
70% acetone to desalt the sample. Afterwards pellets were
resuspended in 200 l Rehydration solution (8 M Urea,
0.5% CHAPS, 0.2% DTT, 0.5% Pharmalyte, 0.002%
Bromphenol blue), incubated for 5 h at room temperature
and loaded on IPG strips pH 3–5.6 NL, 11 cm (GE Healthcare). The strips were focused on an Ettan pIGphorII unit
and the second dimension was run on vertical 10% SDSPAGE gels using the Ettan Daltsix electrophoresis unit (GE
Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
The gels were silver-stained using Roti-Black P (Carl Roth
GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany). The porin was detected by
Western Blotting as mentioned above.
Differential expression analysis of porins by qRT-PCR and
ELISA
Expression of porin genes in the different strains was
determined by means of qRT-PCR using the Mx3000P™
Real-time PCR System (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) or
the StepOnePlus™ Real-Time PCR-System (Applied Biosystems). Mycobacteria were grown to an OD600 of 0.8
and RNA was extracted according to the method of
Bashyam and Tyagi [41]. 1 or 5 g of the RNA was treated
prior to qRT-PCR with RNase-Free DNase (Fermentas
GmbH, St. Leon-Roth, Germany). Reverse transcription of
mycobacterial RNA was carried out using the RevertAid™
M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase (Fermentas GmbH) and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/31

hexamers or the Access RT-PCR System (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocols. The porin cDNA from M. smegmatis SMR5 [42] and
M. fortuitum was quantified either by amplifying a fragment of about 100 bp using the primers (mspATaqfw,
mspATaqbw, mfpqPCRfw and mfpqPCRrev) as well as
TaqMan-probes (mspATaqProbe and mfpqPCRprobe) or
the primers porM1-51-sybr-fw and bw based on SYBR
Green detection chemistry (Table 1). The qPCR reactions
were performed using the SensiMix DNA Kit (Quantace
Ltd., Berlin, Germany) or the Access RT-PCR System
(Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. TaqMan quantification was carried out by running a first step
at 95°C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles with 30 s at
95°C and 1 min at 58°C. SYBR Green quantification was
performed by initial 10 min at 95°C followed by 40 cycles
with 15 s at 95°C, 10 s at 58°C and 20 s at 72°C. Afterwards, the amplicon's melting temperature was determined ramping the temperature from 60°C to 90°C by
0.5°C steps and acquiring the fluorescence signal. cDNA
amounts were determined by three measurements for
each sample using a calibration curve established with
known amounts of linearised pSSa100 [13] in case of M.
smegmatis or pSSp107 in case of M. fortuitum. DNase
treated and non-reverse-transcribed controls were performed with the same samples to guarantee the absence of
contaminating genomic DNA.
In addition to the qRT-PCR experiments, the amount of
porin in isolates of M. fortuitum and M. smegmatis was
determined by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay
(ELISA). Protein was isolated from mycobacteria using the
detergent nOPOE as described above. The isolated protein
(15 l corresponding approximately to 25 g) was diluted
in 50 mM NaHCO3, pH 9.6 to yield a protein concentration of 1 g/100 l. Aliquots (100 l) of the sample and
dilutions thereof were loaded to wells of a Nunc-Immuno
Maxisorp Module (Nalgene Nunc International, NY,
USA). After incubating the samples at 4°C overnight,
wells were washed twice with TBS-T (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH
7.8, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2 and 0.05% Tween 80).
The surface was blocked with 3% powdered skim milk in
TBS for 1.5 h at room temperature followed by three steps
of washing with TBS-T. Samples were then treated with
the primary antibody for 1.5 h at room temperature, using
a 1:1500 dilution of the antiserum pAK MspA#813 [8] in
TBS. The wells were washed five times with TBS-T and
were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a 1:7500
dilution of Peroxidase-conjugated AffiniPure F (ab') 2
Fragment Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) (Jackson Immuno
Research, Soham, UK) in TBS. After five steps of washing,
the reaction was performed using the SureBlue™ TMB
Microwell Peroxidase Substrate (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD,
USA) according to the instructions of the manufacturer.

Absorption at 450 nm was measured with the microplate
reader SPECTRA Fluor (TECAN, Crailsheim, Germany).
Detection of PorMs at the surface of mycobacteria by
means of quantitative microwell immunoassays
40 ml of mycobacterial culture was harvested at OD600 of
0.8, washed with PBS-T and the pellet was resuspended in
1 ml PBS-T. 200 l aliquots were then incubated for 30
min on ice with 1 l of antiserum (pAK MspA#813); for
detection of background pre-immune serum was given to
the samples. Afterwards 1 ml PBS-T was given to each
sample; mycobacteria were harvested by centrifugation
and washed once with PBS-T. Pellets were resuspended in
100 l of PBS-T, 1 l of the secondary Peroxidase-conjugated AffiniPure F (ab') 2 Fragment Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG
(H+L) (Jackson Immuno Research) was added to each
sample and bacilli were incubated on ice for 30 min. After
addition of 1 ml PBS-T, mycobacteria were pelleted by
centrifugation and were washed once with PBS-T. Pellets
were then resuspended in 500 l of PBS-T, and 100 l of
dilutions thereof were transferred to wells of a NuncImmuno Polysorp Module (Nalgene Nunc International).
After addition of 100 l SureBlue™ TMB Microwell Perox-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/31

idase Substrate (KPL) and stopping the reaction by addition of 50 l 1 M HCl, the reaction was detected by the
reader SPECTRAFluor (TECAN).
Complementation of the porin-deficient mutant strain M.
smegmatis ML10 with porM1 and porM2
The ability of porM1 and porM2 to complement the
growth defect of M. smegmatis ML10 (mspA; mspC) [4]
was examined by electroporation with the plasmids
pSRa102, pSRa104, pSSa100 (Table 4) as well as the control pMV306. 750 ng of each plasmid was electroporated
into M. smegmatis ML10 as described in Sharbati-Tehrani
et al. [13]. After electroporation the cells were diluted and
plated onto Mycobacteria 7H11 agar supplemented with
kanamycin (25 g/ml) for the assessment of growth after
four days and for the quantification of growth by cfu
counting during four days.
Knock-down of porM expression and over-expression of
porM1 or porM2 in M. fortuitum
In order to accomplish a simultanous knock-down of
porM1 and porM2, we generated a plasmid containing a

region of porM genes. The primers porM1-as-1 and
porM1-as-2 were used to amplify a 100 bp PCR amplicon
covering the 5' region of porM1 including the Shine-Dalgarno Sequence. The PCR product was cloned into the
BamHI site of pSHKLx1 [43], and recombinant plasmids
containing the insert in antisense orientation with respect
to the hsp60 promoter were identified by sequencing.
Afterwards, the selected recombinant plasmid pSRr106
was introduced into M. fortuitum by electroporation. The
knock-down efficiency of the introduced antisense RNA
was analysed at transcriptional level. For this purpose,
RNA was isolated from M. fortuitum strains containing
either pSRr106 or pSHKLx1, and porin expression was
measured by SYBR Green qRT-PCR as described above.
