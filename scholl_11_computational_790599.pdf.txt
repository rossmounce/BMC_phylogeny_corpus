nematode horizontal gene transfer

Abstract
Sequencing of expressed genes has shown that
nematodes, particularly the plant-parasitic nematodes,
have genes purportedly acquired from other kingdoms
by horizontal gene transfer. The prevailing orthodoxy
is that such transfer has been a driving force in the
evolution of niche specificity, and a recent paper
in BMC Evolutionary Biology that presents a detailed
phylogenetic analysis of cellulase genes in the freeliving nematode Pristionchus pacificus at the species,
genus and family levels substantiates this hypothesis.
The horizontal gene transfer hypothesis
In 1998, Smant and colleagues [1] made a surprising dis­
covery about the cellulases produced by plant-parasitic
nematodes (PPNs). The surprise was not just that an
animal produced cellulase, as nematode cellulases had
previously been demonstrated biochemically [2]. Rather,
analyses of the nematode cellulases revealed a phylo­
genetic incongruence: the deduced protein sequences
appeared to be of bacterial origin, whereas the cellulase
genes bore all the hallmarks of being eukaryotic. Cloning
of genes encoding PPN secretions implicated other
candi­ ates as having been acquired from bacteria by
d
horizontal gene transfer (HGT), and a comprehensive
computational analysis of expressed sequence tag (EST)
data [3] confirmed the widespread occurrence in PPNs of
phylogenetically incongruent genes encoding a myriad of
functions. The availability of complete PPN genomes [4]
has enabled a full reckoning of these genes, and recent
work by Danchin and colleagues [5] proposes hypotheses
about their specific bacterial origins. The genomic
location of the HGT candidates suggested that, once
acquired, the genes had undergone reiterative expansion

into gene families that presumably exhibit functional
diversity [6], although for any given gene and family the
‘multiple acquisition versus expansion’ hypotheses remain
hard to distinguish.
Part of the appeal of the HGT model for PPN is that
many of the functions encoded by these genes can be
reconciled with the biology of the nematode. It seems
especially obvious that acquisition of genes encoding
phytolytic enzymes by a plant parasite would be advan­
tageous. What then should be made of the discovery that
the free-living nematode Pristionchus pacificus (Figure 1)
also encodes cellulolytic enzymes [7]; were these enzymes
also acquired by HGT? As they report in a recent paper
in BMC Evolutionary Biology, Ralf Sommer and colleagues
(Mayer et al. [8]) set out to investigate four criteria they
deemed requisite for successful HGT: that the gene is
functionally active; that it is integrated into the host
genome; that it displays longevity; and that it shows
evidence of having experienced selective pressure.

Diplogastrid cellulases
By sequencing the transcriptomes of seven Pristionchus
species as well as three closely related diplogastrid
nematodes (Diplogasteroides magnus, Koerneria sudhausi
and Acrostichus species), the authors were able to lever­
age a well-established phylogenetic relationship between
the ten species to conduct a series of hypothesis-driven
inquiries at the species, genus and family levels of
evolutionary relationships [8]. The focus of this work is
on a family of cellulase genes thought to have been
acquired from an ancestral slime-mold species in an
ancient HGT event. The cellulases were identified in all
seven Pristionchus species and in K. sudhausi, but were
not found in the remaining two species. Assays confirmed
a perfect correlation between the presence of the gene in
the transcriptomic data and demonstrable cellulase
activity, thus satisfying the first criteria of functional
activity of a horizontally acquired gene.
A comparison of the nematode cellulase genes with the
cellulase genes in slime molds indicates that amelioration,

the process by which the foreign gene assumes the
identity of its host, has taken place. Notably, intron size
and number in the genes reflect the general genestructure patterns found within each species. This
satisfies the second criterion that the genes be integrated
into the host genome after a transfer event. Innovatively,
Mayer et al. [8] build on the current phylogenetic frame­
work to address the last two features of successful HGT,
namely longevity and selective pressure. The 12 Pristionchus
cellulase ESTs that contained the carbohydrate-binding
module at their carboxyl terminus were used in a
phylogenetic reconstruction of the genes’ history. For 11
of the 12 genes, the topology of the phylogeny was
identical with that of the species tree. The observed
concordance of the gene history with the species history
implies that the gene transfer must have survived
multiple speciation events and points to it being ancient.
This is a strong indicator of longevity of the cellulases
following acquisition by an ancestral species.

Evolution of Pristionchus cellulases
It is in addressing the final question - pertaining to the
selective pressures acting on genes that have been hori­ on­
z
tally acquired - that the power of this approach is seen. A
comparison by Mayer et al. [8] of cellulase genes amplified
from the genomes of 24 distinct P. pacificus isolates
revealed an interesting history of the evolution of Ppacel-1, Ppa-cel-2 and Ppa-cel-3. Although Ppa-cel-1 and
Ppa-cel-2 were identified in all the isolates, Ppa-cel-3 was
found only in 16 of the 24 genomes. Sequence-similarity

comparisons of the three genes within the isolates
suggest that Ppa-cel-3 is the result of a recent duplication
of Ppa-cel-2, and has not yet become fixed in the species.
This evidence of gene turnover would seem to be a clear
example of active evolutionary pressures on the species.
Using empirical Bayesian methods to examine synony­
mous and nonsynonymous substitutions at specific sites
across the gene, a likelihood ratio test indicated
significant site-specific positive selection in Ppa-cel-2,
but not in Ppa-cel-1 or Ppa-cel-3, thus showing
differential selection on the three cellulases within the P.
pacificus isolates.
This detailed analysis of the evolutionary dynamics of a
family of horizontally acquired genes is the most compre­
hensive to date. By addressing multiple criteria indicative
of successful HGT, Mayer et al. [8] provide compelling
evidence bolstering the hypothesis that HGT is indeed an
important component in nematode evolution. Beyond
mere scientific curiosity, however, genes acquired by
HGT may represent potential targets for the development
of novel nematicides or vaccines, both of which are sorely
needed. And it would be interesting to know why a
bacterivorus nematode encodes cellulase.
