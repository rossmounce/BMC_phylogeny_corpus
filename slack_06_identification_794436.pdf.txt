Abstract
Background: Leptospira is the causative genus of the disease, leptospirosis. Species identification
of pathogenic Leptospira in the past was generally performed by either DNA-DNA hybridisation or
16s rRNA gene sequencing. Both methods have inherent disadvantages such as the need for radiolabelled isotopes or significant homology between species. A conventional and real-time PCR
amplification and sequencing method was developed for an alternate gene target: DNA gyrase
subunit B (gyrB). Phylogenetic comparisons were undertaken between pathogenic Leptospira
16srRNA and gyrB genes using clustering and minimum evolution analysis. In addition 50
unidentified Leptospira isolates were characterised by gyrB sequencing and compared with
conventional 16s rRNA sequencing.
Results: A conventional and real-time PCR methodology was developed and optimised for the
amplification of the gyrB from pathogenic Leptospira species. Non pathogenic and opportunistic
Leptospira species such as L. fainei and L. broomi were not amplified. The gyrB gene shows greater
nucleotide divergence (3.5% to 16.1%) than the 16s rRNA gene (0.1% to 1.4%). Minimum evolution
analysis reveals that the gyrB has a different evolution topology for L. kirschneri and L. interrogans.
When the two genes were compared for the identification of the 50 unknown isolates there was
100% agreement in the results.
Conclusion: This research has successfully developed a methodology for the identification of
pathogenic Leptospira using an alternate gene to 16s rRNA. The gyrB encoding gene shows higher
nucleotide/evolutionary divergence allowing for superior identification and also the potential for
the development of DNA probe based identification.

Background
Leptospirosis is the zoonotic disease caused by members
of the genus, Leptospira. They are motile helical spirochaetes that metabolise long chain fatty acids as their carbon

source. There are 17 species of Leptospira as determined by
DNA-DNA hybridisation [1-4]. These species can be further divided into pathogenic, non-pathogenic and opportunistic/possibly pathogenic Leptospira with pathogenic

species. The pathogenic Leptospira include; L. interrogans,
L. kirschneri, L. santarosai, L. weilii, L. alexanderi, L. borgpetersenii, L. genomospecies 1 and L. noguchii. The non
pathogenic Leptospira include: L. biflexa, L. meyeri, L. wolbachii, L. genomospecies 3, L. genomospecies 4, L. genomospecies 5 and opportunistic/intermediate pathogens
Leptospira include L. broomi, L. fainei and L. inadai [3]. The
grouping of the last three species as opportunistic or possible pathogens is due to the lack of information on the
pathogenicity of the species, different phenotypic characteristics compared to the pathogenic Leptospira and also
the limited number of reports of these species involvement in human leptospirosis.
Before molecular techniques such as DNA-DNA hybridisation or 16s rRNA gene sequencing became available,
speciation of the genus Leptospira was limited to the classifications of pathogenic (L. interrogans sensu lato) or
saprophytic (L. biflexa sensu lato) and was performed
using phenotypic tests such as growth at 13°C/30°C or
growth in the presence of a chemical such as 8-Azaguanine [5]. These tests can take up to 28 days to complete
and the results can vary within a species [2]. Since the
introduction of molecular techniques, the identification
of Leptospira species has generally been performed using
either DNA-DNA hybridisation [2,4] or 16s rRNA gene
sequencing. Both of these methods have inherent disadvantages; DNA-DNA hybridisation is laborious and
requires the use of radio-labelled isotopes [6] and the 16s
rRNA gene has significant sequence homology between
species which requires the majority of the gene to be
sequenced for a definitive Leptospira identification. As an
alternative target to 16s rRNA for species identification,
the DNA Gyrase Subunit B gene (gyrB) has been successfully used for species identification in a wide variety of
bacterial genera [7-13]. More recently the gyrB gene has
been used for the identification of Leptospira borgpetersenii
isolates from the Amami Islands [14] though this study
used universal gyrB primers and only conducted limited
phylogenetic
analysis.
This paper reports the development of a molecular technique for the identification of pathogenic Leptospira species using conventional or real-time PCR amplification
and sequencing of a partial fragment of the gyrB gene. The
method was then used to ascertain gyrB sequences from
representative reference strains of the eight pathogenic
species. These sequences were used for phylogenetic and
evolutionary comparisons between the species themselves
and also between the gyrB gene and 16s rRNA gene. To
highlight the potential value of the gyrB as an alternate
identification gene, a blind trial was conducted between
the two gene targets to identify previously uncharacterised
clinical Leptospira isolates.

Results and Discussion
gyrB Amplification
Using conventional and real-time PCR we were able to
amplify a 504 bp product from the eight pathogenic Leptospira species: L. interrogans, L. borgpetersenii, L. weilii, L.
santarosai, L. alexanderi, L. genomospecies 1, L. noguchii
and L. kirschneri. No PCR products were amplified from
the representatives of non-pathogenic species L. biflexa, L.
meyeri or from the pathogenic/intermediate species such
as L. inadai, L. fainei or L. broomi (Figure 1 and 2). The
development of both conventional and real-time PCR
methodologies for the amplification of the gyrB gene enables this method to be instituted at the majority of laboratories and is not dependant on having relatively expensive
real-time PCR equipment. The advantage of using realtime PCR over conventional PCR is that it is quicker
(amplification is completed in less than an hour) and
there is no need to perform agarose gel electrophoresis or
capture the gel image. Confirmation of the gyrB gene
amplification was performed using the melting curve
analysis on the LightCycler instrument. The Tm of the gyrB
PCR product was found to be between 83.4°C and
84.8°C (Figure 2). Cycle sequencing of the gyrB PCR product and comparison of the DNA sequences enabled species specific identification. The gyrB DNA sequences of the
reference strains were deposited on GenBank (Table 1).

The amplification of only the pathogenic species from the
genus Leptospira has created an assay which has a wide
potential in this field of research. For example, the gyrB
PCR could be use to identify pathogenic Leptospira from
cultures or identify Leptospira isolates that have been
overgrown with bacteria or fungi. Additionally it would
be possible to apply this method to clinical samples that
contain high concentrations of Leptospira organisms such
as kidney tissue. The non-culture identification of pathogenic Leptospira would be difficult without the use of specific gyrB primers as universal gyrB primers such as those
used by Kawabata et al. [14] would amplify DNA from all
bacteria present in a sample.
The potential of this assay must be balanced by three
apparent limitations. Firstly the lack of sensitivity of conventional detection methodologies would not enable this
test to be used in diagnosis of human infections where
there are generally only low levels of Leptospira in the
blood. Secondly, potentially pathogenic species such as L.
fainei, L. inadai or L. broomi are not amplified, and therefore could be missed or excluded during molecular investigations. Finally, if a culture or sample contained two
different Leptospira species then it would result in a mixed
sequencing result, requiring use of DNA cloning and multiple sequencing reactions. The ultimate evolution of this
method would be through the use of specific DNA probe
detection either through Taqman/FRET probe in a real-

Comparative phylogenetic analysis
Multiple alignments of the DNA sequences allowed phylogenetic comparisons between the species and between
the gyrB gene and 16s rRNA gene to be performed. Global
clustering (Figure 3) and similarity matrix analysis (Table
2 and 3) was performed using the aligned sequence data
and the Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic
Mean (UPGMA) algorithm for the 16s rRNA, gyrB and a
consensus of both genes to examine the level of relatedness between the pathogenic species. 16s rRNA and gyrB
genes show significant difference in total relatedness as
shown by the percentage scale in Figure 3 and more accu-

rately in the similarity matrix analysis (Table 2 and 3). The
maximum nucleotide difference for the 16s rRNA gene
ranges from 0.1% to 1.4% whilst for the gyrB gene it
ranges from 3.5% to 16.1%. The differences in nucleotide
divergence between the two genes is due to gyrB having a
higher rate of base substitution (0.7–0.8% per 1 million
years) when compared to 16s rRNA (1% per 50 million
years) [15].
In addition to the cluster analysis, minimum evolution
trees for 16s rRNA and gyrB were constructed using 1000
bootstrap replications (Figure 4). The trees have nearly
identical topology except the evolution of L. kirschneri
and L. interrogans in the gyrB gene is quite distinctly different to that of the evolution pattern in the 16s rRNA

gene. The changes in topology signifies that the gyrB gene
in pathogenic Leptospira has undergone significant evolutionary divergence compared to that of the 16s rRNA gene
and this result is consisted with research conducted in
other bacterial genera including the preliminary work
conducted by Kawabata et al. with Leptospira [79,11,12,14-18].

Identification of Leptospira clinical isolates using gyrB
PCR
To validate the use of gyrB as an alternative target to 16s
rRNA, a comparison study was performed using 50 unidentified clinical isolates all from human sources. The
gyrB sequences of the unknown isolates were compared to
those deposited on GenBank using a BLASTn search. Confirmation of the gyrB result was performed using 16s rRNA
sequencing and BLAST analysis as described in the methods. There was 100% agreement between the 16s rRNA

and gyrB gene sequencing for the identification of pathogenic Leptospira species. Within the 50 isolates tested there
was found to be the following number of species; L. alexanderi (1 isolate), L. weilli (10 isolates), L. borgpetersenii
(10 isolates) and L. interrogans (29 isolates). The advantage of using the gyrB gene over the 16s rRNA gene is that
during the BLASTn searches on GenBank, the score values
were generally higher and the E values generally lower for
the predicted species when compared to the 16s rRNA
gene BLASTn searches allowing for greater confidence in
the final result.

Conclusion
We have developed and validated a conventional and
real-time PCR method for the amplification of gyrB gene
from pathogenic Leptospira. When compared to the 16s
rRNA gene, the gyrB gene shows greater evolutionary
divergence and an alternate evolutionary topology for L.
kirschneri and L. interrogans using minimum evolution
analysis. Additionally the greater divergence of the gyrB
gene makes it more amendable to the identification of
pathogenic Leptospira either through sequencing as shown
in this study or in the future by Real-time PCR using DNA
probe technology.

Methods
Leptospira strains and DNA extraction
In total, 37 reference strains from the eight pathogenic
Leptospira species and 50 clinical Leptospira isolates from
human sources were obtained from the WHO/FAO/OIE
Collaborating Centre for Reference & Research on Leptospirosis, Brisbane, Australia. Genomic DNA was
extracted by the following method: 500 µL of Ellinghausen McCullough Johnson Harris (EMJH) media containing actively growing Leptospira was centrifuged in a
micro-centrifuge tube at 12,000 g for 5 min. The supernatant was removed and the pellet re-suspended in 400 µL
of 1× TE Buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). This
suspension was boiled for 10 min and then centrifuged at
12,000 g for 5 min.

genome
sequences:
NC_005823[19,20] and NC_004342[21] using Primer
Premier 5.0 (Premier Biosoft) to amplify a 502 base pair
(bp) fragment of the gyrB gene. PCR amplification was
performed in a final volume of 25 µL using 1 × PCR
buffer, 2.5 mM Magnesium Chloride (MgCl2), 200 µM
dNTPs, 12.5 pmol of oligonucleotides; 2For and 504Rev
(Table 4), one unit of AmpliTaq Gold, 2 µl of DNA extract
and double distilled water (ddH2O) to make up the final
volume. Thermal cycling was as following: Initial denaturation at 94°C for 10 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94°C
for 30 s, 60°C for 30 s and 72°C for 30 s with a final
extension at 72°C for 10 min. 5 µL of PCR product was

(Figure 1).
gyrB amplification: Real-time PCR
Real-time amplification of the gyrB gene was performed in
a total volume of 20 µL containing 2 µL of Fast-Start Sybr
green mix (Roche), 2.4 µL of 25 mM MgCl2, 10 pmol of
oligonucleotides; 2For and 504Rev, 2 µL of template DNA
and ddH2O to make up the final volume. Thermal cycling
was performed on a LightCycler real-time thermalcycler
(Roche) using the following program: initial denaturation
at 95°C for 10 min and 40 cycles of 95°C for 10 s, 60°C
for 20 s and 72°C for 20 s. Fluorescence readings were
taken at the end of each extension cycle in the F1 (FAM/
Sybr green) channel. Melting curve analysis was performed by heating the PCR product from 60°C to 95°C
and monitoring the fluorescence change every 0.2°C. The
melting temperature or Tm was calculated by calculated
on the initial fluorescence curve (F1/I) by plotting the
negative derivative of fluorescence over temperature versus temperature (-dF1/dT versus T). Amplified products
were removed before sequencing from the capillaries by
uncapping and inverting the capillary in a micro-centrifuge tube and centrifuging at 1,500 g for 10 s.

DNA Sequencing
Excess primers and dNTP's were removed from the
remaining PCR product using the following enzymatic
method: 2.5 µl of 10× Antarctic phosphatase buffer (New
England Biolabs, NEB), 10 units of Exonuclease I, E. coli
(Fermentas), 2.5 units of Antarctic phosphatase (NEB)
and 1.5 µl of ddH2O were added to each sample. The PCR
product plus enzyme mix were incubated at 37°C for 45
min followed by 85°C for 15 min to inactivate the
enzyme. DNA sequencing was performed using the Big
Dye Terminator (BDT) sequencing version 3.1 (Applied
Biosystems) with the following modifications: each 20 µL
reaction contained 0.5 µL of BDT mix (1/16th dilution in
final volume), 3.75 µL of 5× dilution buffer, 3.2 pmol of
primer, 5–10 ng of DNA and ddH2O to make up the final
volume. Cycle sequencing was performed using 33 cycles
of 95°C for 10 s, 50°C for 10 s and 60°C for 4 min. The
cycle sequencing products were purified using the sodium
acetate/alcohol precipitation method as per manufacturers' instructions (Applied Biosystems). The purified products were forwarded to the Griffith university DNA
sequencing facility (GUDSF), Brisbane, Australia for capillary electrophoresis using the ABI 3130 × l instrument.
The sequences were assembled and trimmed to a minimum of two contiguous sequences using the Vector NTI
software (Invitrogen).

AS was responsible for design of the study, conducting the
molecular experiments and the preparation of the manuscript. MD and MS provided laboratory support by providing culture, maintaining culture collections and
contributed to the editing of the manuscript. LS approved
the research study/funding, provided intellectual input
and contributed to the editing of the manuscript. All
authors have read and approved the final manuscript.
