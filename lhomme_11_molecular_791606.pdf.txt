from Canadian sheep and goats

Abstract
Background: Small Ruminant Lentiviruses (SRLV) are widespread in Canadian sheep and goats and represent an
important health issue in these animals. There is however no data about the genetic diversity of Caprine Arthritis
Encephalitis Virus (CAEV) or Maedi Visna Virus (MVV) in this country.
Findings: We performed a molecular and phylogenetic analysis of sheep and goat lentiviruses from a small
geographic area in Canada using long sequences from the gag region of 30 infected sheep and 36 infected goats
originating from 14 different flocks. Pairwise DNA distance and phylogenetic analyses revealed that all SRLV
sequences obtained from sheep clustered tightly with prototypical Maedi visna sequences from America. Similarly,
all SRLV strains obtained from goats clustered tightly with prototypical US CAEV-Cork strain.
Conclusions: The data reported in this study suggests that Canadian and US SRLV strains share common origins.
In addition, the molecular data failed to bring to light any evidence of past cross species transmission between
sheep and goats, which is consistent with the type of farming practiced in this part of the country where single
species flocks predominate and where opportunities of cross species transmissions are proportionately low.

Introduction
Caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus (CAEV) and ovine
Maedi-visna virus (MVV) are members of the small ruminant lentiviruses (SRLVs) group in the retroviridae family
infecting goats and sheep worldwide [1,2]. Lentiviruses
from different animal species have in common their genomic organization, the induction of slowly progressive diseases, the large spectrum of targeted organs and symptoms
and the ability to persist in their hosts despite a strong
immunological response. Transmission of SRLVs is
thought to occur predominantly through ingestion of
infected milk but, at least in sheep, horizontal transmission
may also play a prominent role [3,4]. Common clinical
signs caused by SRLV infections include neurological disorders, dyspnoea, emaciation, mastitis and arthritis [2,5,6].
The genomic organization of SRLVs is typical of lentiviruses: positive sense RNA dimmers of approximately 9
kb in size which consist of long terminal repeats (LTRs),

gag (group specific antigens), pol (polymerase) env (envelope) genes in addition to a number of regulatory genes.
The gag and pol genes are relatively well conserved among
SRLVs, which makes them ideal targets for PCR primer
design [2]. Originally, MVV and CAEV prototypical strains
such as strain K1514 [7], EV-1 [8], SA-OMVV [9] and
Cork-CAEV [10] were viewed as distinct viral species
restricted to their respective hosts. Viruses isolated from
sheep were closely related and referred to as MVV, and
those isolated from goats were referred to as CAEV. Over
the last two decades however, as more SRLV sequences
became available for phylogenetic analyses, it became evident that SRLVs can cross the species barrier since some
ovine and caprine strains appear on shared branches in
family trees [11-13]. Additionally, molecular-epidemiological evidence suggest that SRLVs can transmit between
sheep and goats under favourable conditions (Shah et al
2004; Pisoni et al 2005). In Canada, SRLV infections are
widespread in small ruminants and have been associated
principally with lung and mammary lesions in sheep and
arthritis and emaciation in goats [14,15]. National surveys
revealed that 63% of sheep flocks and 52.9% of goat flocks

had at least one infected animal ([15];Simard C., unpublished observations). In addition, SRLV were detected in
31.3% of Quebec sheep and 82.5% of milking goats ([16]
and unpublished). Despite the fact that SRLVs have been
known to circulate and cause disease in Canadian sheep
and goats for more than three decades, molecular characterization of SRLV strains had never been carried out in
either species [17]. In this study, we report for the first
time, genomic sequences and phylogenetic analyses of
Canadian SRLVs from a small geographic area. Nearly
complete gag sequences from both sheep and goats were
obtained from animals belonging to single species flocks.

Materials and methods
A total of 139 goats and 101 sheep originating from 9
and 5 flocks respectively, were investigated in the present
study between 2004 and 2006. The study was approved
by the CFIA animal ethical committee. All samples were
tested for the presence of SRLV serum antibodies using a
recombinant ELISA [18] and by nested PCR. All flocks
were single species flocks. WBC were isolated from
whole blood and DNA was extracted using the QIAamp
DNA blood kits following the manufacturer’s instructions
(Qiagen, Mississauga, Ont). We designed primers corresponding to the most highly conserved sequences in the
gag/pol regions from available SRLV genomes in public
databases. A total of 6 MVV and 6 CAEV primers were
chosen which amplified 1211 bp and 1250 bp fragments
respectively (Table 1). Four primers were used in the first
PCRs to increase the probability of amplifying the targeted viral segments, and 2 primers were used in the second nested PCRs. The general conditions for PCR were
as follows: between 0.5-1 μg total DNA/reaction, 1X PCR
buffer (Invitrogen, Mississauga, ON), 200 μM of each

dATP, dCTP, dGTP and dTTP (Invitrogen, Mississauga,
ON), 250 nM of each primer, 3 mM MgCl 2 , and 1U
Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, Mississauga,
ON). Final reaction volume was 50 μl. Activation of
Platinum Taq and initial denaturation was done at 94°C
for 2 minutes followed by 35 cycles at 94°C for 1 minute,
55°C for 1 minute and 72°C for 2 minutes. Nested amplifications were carried out in the same conditions as the
first round of PCR with 1 μl from PCR reaction 1. Detection of amplicons was carried out on 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and SYBRsafe staining (Invitrogen,
Mississauga, ON). PCR products were purified on PCR
cleanup columns (Qiagen, Mississauga, ON) and cloned
using the PCR TOPO 2.1 (T/A) cloning kit (Invitrogen,
Mississauga, ON). Each gag fragment was cloned and 3
clones of each strain were sequenced in both directions,
the consensus sequence was used in the aligments.
Sequencing reactions were performed using Big Dye v3.1
chemistry from Applied Biosystems on a 3730 × l
sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Nucleotide sequences
were analysed and edited using the BioEdit software v
7.0.9.0. Multiple alignments of the nucleotide sequences
and the deduced amino acid sequences were generated
with ClustalW built in MEGA 4.1 [19]. Mean pairwise
genetic distances were calculated using MEGA version
4.1 with the p-distance model, applying the default setting and with the exception that all sites with ambiguous
codes and gaps were ignored. Two phylogenetic analyses
were performed. First, Canadian SRLV nucleotide
sequences and representative SRLV strains belonging to
different SRLV group A and B according to the classification of Shah et al [13] were compared. Second, Canadian
SRLV sequences, reference SRLV strains and field strains
covering different geographic origin were aligned. Phylogeny reconstruction was carried out using the Neighbour-Joining (NJ) method [20] implemented in MEGA
4.1 with the Tamura-Nei gamma distance. The statistical
confidence of the topologies was assessed with 1000
bootstrap replicates. The shape parameter alpha for a discrete gamma distribution of substitution rates, which
accommodates for substitution rate variation across sites
(e.g. higher substitution rates in mutational hot spots;
[21] and the transition/transversion rate ratio parameter
kappa were estimated simultaneously by maximum likelihood by using TREE-PUZZLE [22]. The substitution
model assumed was Felsenstein’s F84 model which
accommodates unequal base frequencies and transitions/
transversion rate bias [23].

Results and discussion
We amplified genomic fragments of approximately 1200
nucleotides representing 90% of the gag gene (corresponding to position 600-1800 nt region of prototype
CAEV-CO, M33677) from 36 goats and 30 sheep from

14 different single-species flocks. Intra-animal mean
nucleotide divergence ranged from 0.4 to 1% in sheep
and from 0.2 to 0.9% in goats. Intra-farm mean nucleotide divergence ranged from 0.5 to 2% in sheep and
from 3.5 to 6.4% in goats. For simplicity, we selected
representative strains from each flock, 9 from goats and
5 from sheep for phylogenetic analyses. Canadian SRLV
gag sequences from sheep and goats were aligned with
and compared to prototypical SRLV sequences. Results
show that SRLVs isolated from goats contained a double
glycine “GG“ motif (in bold in figure 1) characteristic of
the CAEV-Cork lineage and were most similar to prototypical CAEV strains. SRLV sequences isolated from
sheep did not contain the “GG” motif and were most
similar to prototypical MVV strains (figure 1). The
mean percentages of divergence at the nucleotide level
among proviral sequences from goats and sheep were
8.1 ± 0.5% and 4.5 ± 0.4%, respectively; while the mean
percentage of divergence between sequences from the
two species was 25.5 ± 1.2%.
Multiple alignments of prototypical SRLV strains
belonging to different SRLV group A (A1, A2, A3 and
A4) and B (B1 and B2) along with Canadian SRLV
sequences were performed using approximately 45% of
the gag gene (~650 bp corresponding to position 11501800 nt of the prototype CAEV-CO, M33677). From
these sequence alignments, the gamma distribution
parameter alpha and the transition/tranversion ratio
were calculated as 0.28 (S.E. 0.01) and 3.05 (S.E. 0.18),
respectively. A phylogenetic tree was built using these
alignments as shown in figure 2. The caprine proviral

isolates tightly segregate with CAEV-like sequences
belonging to SRLV subtype B1 together with the CAEVCork prototype strain isolated from a North American
goat. Mean nucleotide divergence between Canadian
caprine and CAEV-Cork sequence is 7.8 ± 0.6%. Ovine
proviral isolates were most similar to MVV-like
sequences belonging to SRLV subtype A2 clustering
with visna virus strain 85/34 isolated from a North
American sheep. Mean nucleotide divergence between
Canadian ovine and strain 85/34 sequences was 9.8 ±
0.8%. Multiple alignments of reference and field SRLV
strains from different geographic origin including Canadian strains using the entire sequenced nucleotides fragments (~1200 bp - 90% of the gag gene from position
600 nt to1800 nt of prototype strain CAEV-CO,
M33677) were also performed. From these alignments,
the gamma distribution parameter alpha and the transition/tranversion ratio were calculated as 0.39 (S.E. 0.02)
and 3.11 (S.E. 0.14), respectively. The phylogenetic
reconstruction using this alignment (figure 3) confirms
the close clustering of caprine and ovine strains from
this country with CAEV-like and MVV-like sequences,
respectively. Furthermore, according to the geographic
origin of SRLV strains, Canadian and North America
SLRV sequences appear closely related suggesting a
common origin. No Canadian strains were found to
cluster in “mixed” SRLV groups of strains detected in
sheep and goats such as groups A3 or A4 in the
phylograms.
Before the mid 90s, as the first genomic sequences
became available, SRLVs from distinct geographical

origins were grouped according to the species they were
isolated from. Two distinct but related taxonomic clusters were evident, one evolving in sheep and the other
evolving in goats. In the mid 90s however, as more
sequences from SRLVs were characterized, more complex distribution of strains became evident upon phylogenetic reconstructions, suggesting that SRLVs could no
longer be grouped solely based on the species they were
obtained from. These findings modified the perception
about the faithful relationship between SRLVs and their
hosts and led to the concept of cross species transmission [11]. Numerous phylogenetic studies followed and
brought additional evidence that SRLVs could no longer
be classified according to the species they were recovered from [13,24]. Nowadays, MVV and CAEV are no
longer viewed as two distinct viral species infecting
exclusively sheep and goats, respectively, but are rather
viewed as a continuum of strains or quasispecies that
can transmit between small ruminants under favourable
conditions [1,11,25].
Results from our study somehow contrast with these
recent studies which have generally reported more complex phylogenetic relationships between SRLVs and
their hosts. The relatively homogeneous strain populations that were found within each host species in our
study could be explained by a founder effect coupled to
the single species flock type of management that prevails
in this part of the country. Single species flocks type of
farming obviously limits close contact between the two
species and diminishes the risks of cross species transmission. SRLV strains confined to a single species are
expected to be more homogeneous than if transmitted
between different host species with the need to readapt
each time. Alternatively, our small sample size might
under represent the true variety of SRLV strains circulating in small ruminants of this country. A further
explanation could come from the primers used in our
study, which might have selected specific strain subgroups. Although we think of this last possibility as
being highly unlikely since we used combinations of
degenerate primers from conserved sequences, it cannot
be completely ruled out. Future large-scale studies
including more flocks from different geographical
regions and breeds in addition to mixed flocks are warranted and might unveil a more thorough picture of the
strain diversity present in the small ruminant population
of this country.
All novel SRLV sequences reported in this study are
available in [GenBank: HQ158122 - HQ158136]
