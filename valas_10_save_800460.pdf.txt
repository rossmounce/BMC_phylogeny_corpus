Save the tree of life or get lost in the woods
Research

Ruben E Valas*1 and Philip E Bourne2

Abstract
Background: The wealth of prokaryotic genomic data available has revealed that the histories of many genes are
inconsistent, leading some to question the value of the tree of life hypothesis. It has been argued that a tree-like
representation requires suppressing too much information, and that a more pluralistic approach is necessary for
understanding prokaryotic evolution. We argue that trees may still be a useful representation for evolutionary histories
in light of new data.
Results: Genomic data alone can be highly misleading when trying to resolve the tree of life. We present evidence
from protein abundance data sets that genomic conservation greatly underestimates functional conservation.
Function follows more of a tree-like structure than genetic material, even in the presence of horizontal transfer. We
argue that the tree of cells must be incorporated into any new synthesis in order to place horizontal transfers into their
proper selective context. We also discuss the role data sources other than primary sequence can play in resolving the
tree of cells.
Conclusions: The tree of life is alive, but not well. Construction of the tree of cells has been viewed as the end goal of
the study of evolution, where in reality we need to consider it more of a starting point. We propose a duality where we
must consider variation of genetic material in terms of networks and selection of cellular function in terms of trees.
Otherwise one gets lost in the woods of neutral evolution.
Reviewers: This article was reviewed by Dr. Eric Bapteste, Dr. Arcady Mushegian, and Dr. Celine Brochier.
Background
The pendulum of scientific opinion often swings back
and forth in the light of new data and hypotheses. 150
years ago Darwin's observations pushed opinion towards
believing the universal tree of life (TOL) existed for the
first time [1]. This view was pushed to an extreme 30
years ago as Woese pioneered the use of sequence data to
build universal trees [2]. But the pendulum has begun to
swing back the other way in the past decade, as a wealth
of prokaryotic genomic data has demonstrated a higher
than expected frequency of horizontal gene transfer
(HGT).
Ford Doolittle and Eric Bapteste's arguments against
the TOL hypothesis are quite compelling [3], and this
view seems to be gaining support [4]. These authors
argue that HGT is so rampant that tree-like representations of prokaryotic species contain too little information
to capture evolutionary histories. Their work questions

whether the metaphor of the TOL is inspired from a historical bias from the taxonomy of eukaryotes, and therefore should not be applied to prokaryotes. This is an
important and worthwhile question to ask. Resolving the
eukaryotic tree is a distinct problem because there is
much less horizontal transfer and a much better preserved fossil record. The conclusion of Doolittle and
Bapteste is not so much that the inability to build the tree
is the problem, rather it is forcing the data into a tree that
needs to be questioned, and in a pluralistic framework,
avoided, since this model does not allow a precise
description of the evolutionary processes.
The TOL and tree of cells (TOC) should be one and the
same. However, the meaning of the former has become
the trees we can build, and the latter has become the
hypothetical tree we cannot build. This difference was
recently discussed in [5]. The reason the TOC is truly a
tree is simple and has been stated by many before us.
Every extant cell on this planet is the daughter of a cell
that came before it [6]. Prokaryotic cells divide by binary
fission. Therefore there must truly be a TOC in the
prokaryotic superkingdoms. Nobody seems to dispute

this. If every daughter cell's membrane kept track of who
its parent was, reconstructing the evolution of cell divisions would be a trivial task. But since there is no selective pressure for cells to do that, so we are left with a more
difficult task.
Since the membranes do not keep track of heredity we
chose a different representation of ancestry, the genome.
The genetic material of the cell does keep track of its parents in some sense as there is selective pressure to ensure
fidelity of replication. All of the issues the community is
currently having with the TOL hypothesis stem from the
simple fact that genomes are not a perfect representation
of membrane history. Membrane heredity is a tree-like
structure, but all of the recent work on the pervasiveness
of HGT has shown that genome heredity is often more of
a network than a tree. We are beginning to have enough
technology to reconstruct genomic evolution, but we are
only beginning to realize how vastly different that is from
cellular evolution. However, even genomic evolution
makes little sense without the light of cellular evolution.
Ernest Rutherford said, "Physics is the only real science.
The rest are just stamp collecting". Some biologists have
taken this as a challenge to create universal laws in biology on par with those in physics. This is a noble endeavor,
and has produced many interesting results, but the goal
should to be to collect stamps in a way that is justified by
the laws. The promise of the TOL did just that. It was a
collection of every living thing as well as the laws that
organized that collection.
Instead of a consensus TOL emerging from the vast
amount of genomic data available, the community was
faced with the disappointment that very few genes are
universally conserved. The universal sequence tree created from 31 concatenated proteins [7] has been criticized as "the tree of 1%" because the average prokaryote
genome has about 3000 genes [8]. They argue that even if
this gene set did produce a reliable tree it would only
reflect a small portion of evolution, since this is such a
tiny portion of the genome. The assumption that genomic
histories were congruent with cellular histories hid the
fact that much of the collection could not be explained by
the TOL hypothesis. The community was lost in the
woods without knowing it under tree monism.
We worry that the sound arguments against the TOL
hypothesis will shift focus away from evolutionary histories. For instance Dagan et al. [9] have quantified rates of
horizontal transfer for every gene family. This is a tour de
force of quantifying a law in biology. However, they do
not give examples of the rates for any specific family, or
cite any example they found where a horizontal transfer
played a role in speciation. They also say their results are
independent of the vertical tree used as input, which we
find worrying. The overall rates of HGT may not change,
but we assume the rates for each family almost certainly

would. Not worrying about that difference is getting lost
in the woods to us because the real history of the stamp
collection is lost in search of a concise law.
Here we argue for the need to be cautious about how
far away from the TOL hypothesis we swing, as novel
sources of data already bring into question the conclusions supported by genomics. The arguments against the
TOL are centered on the idea that the modern synthesis
of biology from 50 years ago was too eukaryote-centric.
We hope to offer a perspective that will spare this current
synthesis from being labeled too genome-centric 50 years
from now. We are not arguing for tree monism. Instead
we are attempting to demonstrate that the TOC becomes
even more important under a pluralistic approach. Not
all genes contribute equally to the cell, and we will demonstrate that vertical inheritance of function has a more
pronounced signal than vertical inheritance of genetic
material. Using only universal sequences to attempt to
resolve the TOC is a narrowing strategy, and we will discuss alternative sources of data that may still shed light on
this problem.

Results and Discussion
The Great Tree of Cellular Function

The attempts at resolving the TOL using universal
sequences only represent a small part of the history of
genomes, but what portion of the history of cells does it
represent? Genomic methods represent all genes equally.
Subsequently, a gene that is only expressed under specific
conditions can be just as useful as a housekeeping gene
for building a species phylogeny if both are present across
the same set of genomes. If we created a concatenated
protein sequence, both proteins would be counted as
equals proportional to their length despite vast differences in their actual abundance as proteins in the cell.
Here lies the fundamental shortcoming of genomics; confusing the genome and the cell. If we wish to measure a
gene's contribution to the cell there are many different
metrics: essentiality, abundance of proteins, number of
transcripts, and portion of total weight are just a few. Any
of these will give dramatically different proportions than
simply counting the copy number within the genome.
The abundance of many proteins present in Escherichia
coli's cytoplasm has recently been calculated experimentally [10] as well as for the entire cell of Leptospira interrogans [11]. For the first time data are available to
measure what portion of a prokaryotic cell each protein
comprises. All of these numbers should be taken with a
grain of salt due to experimental noise, but the trend is
clear; the core proteins make up a larger portion of the
cell than the genome. The data used to calculate these
values are available as Additional files 1 and 2. We argue
abundance is a good proxy for evolutionary importance
because there is a correlation between the abundance of a

protein and the energy a cell invests into producing it. It
has been demonstrated that highly expressed proteins
have been optimized to use less energetically costly
amino acids [12], and that highly abundant proteins are
shorter on average [10]. The abundant proteins justify the
use of a large portion of the cell's energy despite these
optimizations, so they must be important. Proteins perform most of the functions in the cell. Comparing how
many of the same functions two cells are doing at the
same time is a good measure of similarity. The downside
of abundance is it is dynamic during a single generation,
while genomes are static. This makes direct comparison
more difficult, but it still gives insight into the evolution
of genomes. Our point is not that this data magically fixes
all problems with the TOL hypothesis, but rather that
many important details are left unresolved in our understanding of the big picture that still may come into focus.
Let us consider the so called "tree of 1%". The authors
list 36 genes that are universal but claim that only 31 have
not been horizontally transferred [7], although later analysis claims the number is actually 22 [13]. However, there
are arguments that a TOL is still meaningful despite a
large incongruence between individual gene trees [14],
but a detailed argument against that view is presented in
[4]. 34 of these genes are present in the E. coli data set
that measures abundance for 1103 proteins. For this argument let us consider the universal set because in this case
the HGTs appear to be displacements of genes that were
already present. That is to say the function of these genes
was vertically inherited despite HGTs of the genetic
material. This brings up the point that there are two distinct forms of HGT that we need to consider that are currently not distinguished enough; functional innovations
(relative to the recipient genome) and displacements.
For example, the histories of the 20 aminoacyl-tRNA
synthetases (AARSs) contain many inconsistencies, the
result of HGTs [15]. However, it still appears that most of
these enzymes date back to the last universal common
ancestor (LUCA), with the possible exceptions of AsnRS

and GlnRS. HGT makes many of these proteins unusable
for reconstructing a universal TOC as their sequence
trees would be inconsistent with the cellular history.
However, the HGTs of this family would displace a copy
of the gene that was already present. In that sense there is
no functional innovation caused by the transfer. Even
though the genetic material was inherited horizontally
the functional content was still transmitted vertically, and
would still be consistent with the TOC. We argue events
like this are far more deleterious to tree reconstruction
algorithms than they are to the recipient cells. Current
methods for estimating HGT rely on measuring inconsistencies between sequence trees or looking for unusual
compositional features [16], so there is no way for them
to distinguish between innovations and displacements.
We must also consider the role functional redundancy
plays in prokaryotes. There are nearly two hundred
known cases of non homologues enzymes performing
analogous reactions [17]. HGT of such enzymes should
be relatively easy since they can plug into existing metabolic pathways. Therefore any current measure of the
vertical inheritance of genetic material is a lower bound
on functional vertical inheritance. If one wishes to measure the size of the vertical component of evolution it
must be done in terms of function as well as genetic
material.
The universal genes are about 3% of the E. coli dataset if
we count all genes equally. However, it we count proteins
by abundance, the 34 from the universal core make up
6.6% of the data set (Table 1). That would double the
thickness of the vertical component! A tree of 2% may not
seem dramatically better than a tree of 1% but the point is
that the universal proteins make up a larger portion of the
cell than the genome. This gets quite dramatic when one
takes into consideration that 84.5% of the abundance in
this dataset is made up of ribosomal protein L33. L33 is
universal across the Bacteria, but absent in the Archaea.
Although it is not universal it still must be very ancient.
The fact that a large portion of the cytosolic proteome of

an extant cell would be present in the cytosol of LUCA
truly speaks to the fact that vertical inheritance can be a
major force along long evolutionary time scales. This is
consistent with previous work that showed older genes
are expressed at higher levels than younger genes [18].
However, the authors did not quantify the contribution of
the universal proteins in this manner.
The protein abundance from L. interrogans [11] provides us an opportunity to test the trends we see in E. coli.
This data set was not dominated by a single protein like
L33 in E. coli. The 36 universal proteins make up only
about 1% of this genome, but 5.4% of the entire cell's
abundance (Table 2). A tree of 5% starts to sound significant! This shows the vertical component of the TOL is
five times thicker than genomics alone would lead us to
believe. Again, regardless of the nature of LUCA, extant
cells still have a significant amount of function in common with her.
The TOL hypothesis has also been challenged on the
grounds that currently defined taxa may have a very small
genomic core (the intersection of their gene sets) and
very large pan genomes (the union of their gene sets)
[3,4]. We analyzed the genomic cores' abundances to
explore their contribution to the cell. A subset of the proteins in any Enterobacteriaceae genome are conserved in
enough genomes to be considered part of their genomic
core, and even fewer are conserved across all nine
genomes studied in [19]. This is a very diverse set of bacteria ranging from endosymbionts to free-living species.
In each case the coverage in terms of genes is much
smaller than the coverage in terms of protein abundance
(Table 1). The most dramatic example is that the genes
conserved in all nine genomes only account for about
61% of the genes in this dataset, but they account for
99.8% of the protein abundance! Since the ribosomal proteins are so dominant in the data set, we repeated the
same measures excluding ribosomal proteins as was done
in the initial study. The results are not as impressive, but
in each case the core proteins are up to 20% more abundant in the cell than they are in the genome. Measuring
the similarity of species based on shared gene content
greatly underestimates their functional conservation.
We also considered a set of genes conserved across four
Spirochete genomes [20] that includes both obligate and
non-obligate parasites. 412 proteins that were conserved
across four Spirochete species were mapped to the abun-

dance data set. This accounts for only 11.3% of the L.
interrogans genome, but makes up 31% of the cell when
counted by abundance (Table 2). There is stronger conservation between these species than genomic data
implies. Again, even though these species have vastly different lifestyles a large cellular core has remained conserved between them.
We assigned COGs (clusters of orthologous genes) to
every gene in the L. interrogans dataset using the
STRING database [21]. This allowed us to compare the
relative age of a COG (the percentage of bacterial
genomes that have a particular COG) to the genomic or
cellular portion of this dataset that COG composes. A
cumulative plot of genomic and cellular abundance
reveals that at every level genomic abundance underestimates cellular abundance (Figure 1). In some cases the
difference can be as high as 20%. A similar plot for the E.
coli dataset was not informative because the dominating
feature is ribosomal protein L33 (data not shown).
We mapped the tree inconsistency scores (ISs) for all
trees from the forest of life in [22] to these datasets to test
our proposal that abundance is a barrier to HGT. IS is
defined as the frequency the splits in a specific tree are
found in all single gene phylogenies in the forest of life.
Therefore it is an estimate of the horizontal transfer rate
for each family. The authors of that work found that ISs
have a bimodal distribution, with many families having
very low IS (below .6 of the average IS) or very high IS
(above 1.4 of the average IS). They noticed many ribosomal proteins had very low IS and proposed this is due
to their numerous physical interactions. If highly abundant proteins are less likely to be transferred their trees
should not have high ISs. However, there may still be proteins that are not abundant with very low ISs for reasons
besides abundance, so we do not think a comparison of
average ISs is informative. Instead we counted how many
high ISs were found in the 100 most abundant proteins
that had an IS. We repeated this measure excluding ribosomal proteins to ensure this result is due to abundance
and not just physical constraints on protein complexes. Pvalues were estimated by taking 10,000 permutations of
100 ISs taken out of all possible ISs. In each case they
were significantly less high ISs among the most abundant
proteins than would be expected by chance (Table 3).
Abundance does not mean it is impossible for a transfer
to occur, but it certainly seems to limit it. Even though the

backbone of vertical inheritance may appear to be
dwarfed by HGT on the genomic scale, it is clear that vertical inheritance plays a larger role in the cell than the
genome.
One of the major criticisms of tree monism is the arbitrary methods used to deal with incongruent data and
ambiguities in a single tree of life model [4]. Bapteste et
al. cite the ambiguous placement of Aquifex aeolicus in a
supertree as an example of conflicting signals; sometimes
they are placed near the Proteobacteria and sometimes
near Thermotoga maritima [23]. We propose that abundance could be used to consider the relative weights of
two incongruent signals such as these. We predict the
vertical signal would become clear if we could measure
the abundance of proteins shared between A. aeolicus, T.
maritima, and the Proteobacteria. It is not just the num-

ber of genes that are shared that matters; one needs to
consider what their contribution to the cell is.
Placing sequence trees in their cellular context

So far we have argued the large role vertical inheritance
of function has played in evolution is larger than the network of genomes implies. But how can we proceed forward if that tree is not the one reconstructed by gene
sequence trees? We must first discuss the very reasons
the TOL metaphor is appealing in the first place. Trees
are the natural representation of replicating processes
[24]. As discussed in [4] the tree representation has three
strengths: 1) it provides a hierarchy for classification; 2)
shared traits are implied by that hierarchy; and 3) ancestral traits are inferred from the branch order of the tree.
We believe the strength of the hierarchy rests on the last
two points so we will address those first.

The branching order of a true species tree can be read
like a timeline. It implies the ancestral state for each
group, as well as the transition that defined the groupings. Without a timeline much of evolution becomes gibberish. There are many transitions that can be polarized.
The biggest transition in evolution is between the
prokaryotes and eukaryotes. It is truly impossible to represent endosymbiosis in a tree representation, but an
undirected network would just say that the eukaryotes
are related to both the archaea and bacteria. However, it
is not just the relationships we need to know to understand this event; the key point is the directionality of the
transition. The eukaryotes came from the prokaryotes.
That is to say there was a time where prokaryotes existed
but eukaryotes did not. Trees have many shortcomings
for representing prokaryotic evolution, but any data
structure that lacks temporality is even worse.
Since there is no real branch order on any of the current
universal sequence trees or networks, some take this as
evidence that the origin of all the major prokaryotic taxa
are contemporaneous (the condensed cladogenesis
model) [25] or are the result of intense periods of HGT
(the biological big bang model) [26]. If the major events in
prokaryotic evolution all happen near the root of the tree,
then it might be really be impossible to reconstruct life's
history. However, there are no fossils that unambiguously
mark the origin of any major prokaryotic taxa (reviewed
in [27]). Therefore the justification for both of these models comes from a lack of resolution in both the fossil and
sequence data. It is critical we make a distinction between
the big picture of evolutionary history being hard to
resolve and it not existing.
We argue against the expectation that every major
prokaryotic taxa showed up at the same moment in evolutionary history. Not all innovations are possible immediately in evolution; they need the right push in selective
pressure from the environment. The most important
examples are processes that require an oxygenic atmosphere such as sterol synthesis [28]. Oxygen dependent
metabolism could not thrive before the great oxidation
event that occurred about 2.3 billion years ago [29]. This
can be used to constrain the ages of several branches of
the TOL [30].
This begs the question of whether the major prokaryotic taxa are contemporaneous in origin or not. Despite
the disagreement between the current macrophylogenies
[31-33], they imply the major prokaryotic taxa did not
appear at the same time. The disagreement between
these phylogenies is not in terms of how to define the
major taxa but rather in the proper way to polarize the
data, especially the indels (insertion deletions) which we
have discussed [34]. However, the distribution of these
traits themselves implies specific taxa evolved before
another, regardless of the direction of each polarization.

Page 6 of 20

For example, there is a large insert in HSP70 (heat shock
protein 70) that is present across the Gram-negative bacteria, but absent in the Gram-positives. There is no reason to assume the insertion deletion event occurred early
in evolution. That event would be contemporaneous to
the change in membrane structure. There must be a
branch order between the Gram-positives and Gramnegatives; even if it is not resolved in sequence trees. One
would be very hard pressed to draw a detailed scenario of
transfers that explains the distribution of fixed indels better than a more timeline like structure. There are numerous similar divides that can be drawn across the
prokaryotes. Relatively stable traits like these must used
as guides to reconstruct the TOC. If the origins of the
major clades really are very close to contemporaneous we
should not expect it to be possible to reconstruct a macrophylogeny at all using such traits. Despite their disagreement, we take the macrophylogenies as evidence
that the origins of major prokaryotic taxa could not all be
contemporaneous. If the clades arose out of intense periods of HGT the indels and other data points should have
largely independent histories. Instead many indels appear
on the same points on the tree, which act to independently verify each other.
Why would there be more signal left in the rare events
instead of the sequence alone? We propose an alternative
model where cladogenesis is primarily caused by revolutions in the "abundome." Some proteins that were highly
abundant in LUCA may be entirely absent in an extant
cell. This would be a result of major events that led to
dramatic changes in gene expression of even the most
conserved genes. Such a change in the abundome could
make some HGTs more deleterious since the protein
would be plugged into a modified core. It is possible these
events could actually be periods of reduced HGT. Abundance data may make it possible to quantify what Simpson coined "quantum evolution" when referring to the
metazoan fossil record [35], the idea that changes in one
part of an organism can trigger a domino effect of rapid
evolution, on a molecular level in prokaryotes. There is
an inverse relationship between population size and evolutionary rate [36]. Initially members of a novel niche
could evolve rapidly. It is also possible that could lead to a
population size that is large enough to cause extreme
purifying selection, essentially freezing ribosomal
sequences. It seems impossible to predict the effects cladogenesis will have on sequences without taking into
account other sources of data. This view that revolutions
in abundances play a role in cladogenesis is supported by
the observation that there are major changes in gene regulation between the major prokaryotic taxa [37]. Since
gene expression is a major driver of evolutionary rates
[38], there is no reason to expect protein sequence to be
well behaved across these events even if cellular popula-

Valas and Bourne Biology Direct 2010, 5:44
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/44

tion size remained constant. That, taken with the new
observation that evolutionary rates vary greatly between
prokaryotic groups [39] implies our null hypothesis
should be that sequence trees would not resolve the
branch order of the major prokaryotic groups even in the
complete absence of HGT. Therefore we are in complete
agreement that a tree created by concatenating protein
sequences together is not the TOL or the TOC. But we do
not take that as evidence the TOC does not exist, is not
resolvable, or is not useful as a concept for understanding
prokaryotic evolution. It just means the community
needs to move beyond primary sequence analysis.
It will be possible to look at the coevolution between
the cellular and genomic cores as abundance data
becomes available from more species. This will allow us
to divide extant species into groups that have maintained
a cellular backbone. Evolution within these groups should
be well suited for study using sequence since there will be
fewer confounding factors. This view is supported by the
growing list of prokaryotic clades that form well defined
sequence trees discussed in [5]. If we can identify the
innovation between groups that leads to the differences
in abundances it may be possible to polarize these transitions in the manner pioneered in [31]. This approach creates a timeline that is appropriate for classification
purposes, and thus we approach the advantages of the
TOL while reconstructing the TOC. Of course there will
be traits that do not fit that timeline and we must consider them in a pluralistic fashion. However, the timeline
will allow us to polarize many of the HGTs and place true
innovations in their proper context. Current sequencebased methods could be made much less arbitrary by
comparing them against these other lines of data. Combining the TOC with genomic histories would capture all
the positive aspects of the TOL hypothesis, while accommodating HGT.
It takes a universal sequence that has not been horizontally transferred and has evolved at a steady rate to build a
universal tree. As discussed above that does not leave us
with very much data. It takes two widely distributed paralogous proteins to polarize an indel [40], which leaves us
with even less. Therefore we are very interested in nonubiquitous traits that may be useful in resolving the
branch order of the prokaryotic taxa. We have found protein structure to be a highly useful tool for studying evolution, but hopefully there are others as well. A transition
within quaternary structure only requires a protein to be
universal within a taxon of interest. We have presented
two transitions in quaternary structure that exclude the
root from the Archaea: Anbu evolving into the 20s proteasome [41] and PyrD 1A evolving into PyrD 1B [34].
Neither of these proteins is in Ciccarelli et al.'s dataset
because they are not universal. But they are derived
structures that are universal enough in the Archaea to

Page 7 of 20

provide compelling independent arguments that exclude
the root of the TOL from within the Archaea. Even if the
proteasome sequences have been horizontally transferred
all over the Archaea it does not take away from the fact all
Archaea have a proteasome (those would be horizontal
displacements). Therefore a protein might be useful for
resolving a branch order in the tree even if there is major
incongruence between the cellular and genetic history. It
is currently possible to predict the tertiary structure for
about half of a prokaryotic proteome [42]. However, quaternary interactions are not being predicted from
sequence in the same way. This gives us hope that there
are still untapped sources of data that might resolve the
branch order of the major prokaryotic taxa.

Conclusion
We must keep in mind the humor of calling the central
metaphor for evolution "the tree of life". The phrase first
appears in Genesis 2:9:
And the LORD God made all kinds of trees grow out of
the ground--trees that were pleasing to the eye and good
for food. In the middle of the garden were the tree of life
and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
There is irony in using the name of a tree central to the
creation story to argue against that very myth. Therefore
we doubt that any phrase will ever pack as much punch as
the "tree of life", even if the pattern of common descent is
more of a web. It is very important that the community
stops labeling any tree derived from a single data source
the TOL. The recent attempts to resolve the TOC using
primary sequence should be labeled "universal sequence
trees", a name that is grounded in the limitations of the
data. The title TOC should be reserved for branch orders
that are supported by several lines of independent evidence, and the TOL should be the synthesis of those
branch orders and horizontal process.
Perhaps the most important line of reasoning that the
TOL exists is the fact that HGT is so rampant. Why is
HGT possible at all? The answer is obviously common
descent. If it was not for common descent the genetic
code would not be universal, and most HGTs would not
even be translatable in their new host. Many biological
parts are interchangeable because they have evolved in
conjunction with the same systems. Therefore, we argue
the very reason the TOC is so hard to reconstruct is
because it exists!!
It has now become clear that many expectations about
prokaryotic evolution were based too heavily on observations of eukaryotes. There is truly a fundamental divide in
the way these two groups use the communal gene pool as
a genetic memory [43]. However if we give up on the
eukaryotes as a model, it is not clear what our expectation
of prokaryotes should be. It does not make sense to us to
criticize a tree as "the tree of 1%" without providing a jus-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/44

tified cutoff of n% that would be enough for the vertical
component of genomic evolution to be meaningful. We
think the TOL crisis would be worse if it was the "tree of
99%", as it would be quite difficult to explain the phenotypic differences between humans and E. coli. It is
remarkable any genes are conserved since LUCA, and
therefore the TOL still rings true to us.
Likewise, it is not clear what level of genome conservation between strains of prokaryotes would be satisfying
enough to consider them evolving in a tree-like manner.
It is true that two strains of the same species may have
relatively few genes in common, but we have argued
above this is probably an exaggeration of functional distance. Abundance data from different strains under similar growth condition will shed light on their true
functional differences. We predict this gap will be much
smaller than it appears from counting genes. Of course
one reaches a point where two species live under different
enough conditions that comparing their abundances is
like comparing apples to oranges. But since expression is
highly correlated with evolutionary rates [38] these are
probably cases where primary sequence analysis would
fail too. More abundance data may shed light on why
some branches of the tree are so much harder to resolve
than others. Fortunately species most likely to exchange
genes horizontally live in similar conditions [23]. This
means it will be possible to compare the relative contribution of horizontal and vertical inheritance to the cell
when protein abundance data are available from different
taxa living in the same environment.
The landscape of genomes is rapidly being filled, and
many higher level taxa are now well sampled. Despite
this, there is no consensus on the TOL and many are
ready to abandon the notion that we will ever reconstruct
it. There is still plenty of data that needs to be generated
to elucidate the history of cells. More information on protein abundance will shed light on the true revolutions in
the history of cells and help prioritize conflicting signals
in the genetic material. Protein and cellular structure will
help us polarize the major events in evolution. It seems to
us that genomes simply are not enough to study genomics. Of course it would be naïve to expect that some new
data source will be a magic bullet that will resolve the
TOC. Instead we must realize each data source has its
shortcomings, many of which cannot be illuminated
except in the context of other data. It is not just that we
need more data, we need more details. Automated methods fall prey to numerous confounding factors but can
still be highly informative. They must always be supplemented by experts whose intuitions have been tempered
by careful examination of details from multiple data
sources. Therefore the best way to move forward is to
take sequence data off center stage and supplement it
with these other data sources.

This view can be summarized by several dualities, best
exemplified by the classic symbol of yin and yang (Figure
2). The basic lesson of this symbol is that one finds the
darkest point in the center of the light, and the brightest
light in the center of the darkness. It is only through
understanding the interplay between the light and dark
that one gains insight into their true nature. Neither can
exist without the other. A new understanding of evolution comes from the study of the interplay between a
series of dualities. It is now clear that there is large distinction between heredity of genetic material and of
membranes. There is clearly a duality in Darwin's theory
of descent with modification; the history of variation is
well described by a network and the history of selection is
well described by a tree. A web of life (WOL) may be
more factual than a single TOC, but we argue it is a less
accurate depiction of life's history. It is possible to precisely represent the relationship between most extant
genetic material on this planet using a network. But without a tree (or time line) of life this undirected graph is
mostly functional displacements and shifts in redundancy in our opinion. The "light" in the confounding
"darkness" of horizontal transfer must be the TOC. Of

Figure 2 The yin and yang of evolution. Several key dualities in evolution are better understood when they are viewed as complements to
each other under the framework of the classic symbol of yin and yang.
Common descent is the prerequisite for HGT, but horizontal innovation shapes the pattern of descent. Inheritance of genetic material is
often web-like, but membrane heredity is tree-like. Both polarities of
each of these dualities exist because of the other. The existence of
darkness does not invalidate the existence of light, just as the prevalence of HGT does not invalidate the TOC.

Valas and Bourne Biology Direct 2010, 5:44
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/44

course the "darkest" points are in the center of the "light"
too. Endosymbiosis is clearly a non-vertical event that has
profoundly influenced the structure of the tree of function. Likewise there are many horizontal innovations that
were important for shaping the prokaryotic tree of function. We feel the most productive way to move forward is
create a duality between the horizontal transfers that
shape evolution and those that confound our tree building algorithms. The point is that neither of these
extremes invalidates the other; they complement each
other. Darwin wrote, "Thus, from the war of Nature, from
famine and death, the most exalted object which we are
capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the
higher animals, directly follows." His understanding that
death comes from life, and life comes from death fits perfectly with the symbol of yin and yang (the link between
the quote and symbol of yin and yang was noted in [44]).
The increase in the size of the functional tree argued
here may not be enough to persuade everyone saving the
TOL is possible. Some prefer to be cautious and label this
the "central trend in the forest of life" [22]. The fact that a
large chunk of universal cellular function has remained
conserved and its sequence behaves in a mostly tree-like
manner after billions of years makes the reconstruction of
the TOC seem possible despite the issues of HGT.
Resolving and rooting this tree are meaningful problems
that are worth pursuing. That is not to say that the tree is
resolved simply by taking a consensus or average of universal gene sequences. However, those who rather look at
the forest of life need to keep in mind that there are some
trees in that forest that are much older and larger than the
others. The central tree(s) must be the landmarks used to
navigate the rest of the forest. HGT has clearly shaped the
prokaryotic world, but if we do not keep in mind the histories of both genomes and cells we will end up lost in the
woods.

Reviewers' Comments
Reviewer's report 1

Eric Bapteste, Université Pierre et Marie Curie, UMR
CNRS 7138, 75005 Paris, France
This paper, in many respects well-balanced, proposes a
strategy to reconstruct a tree of cells, and discusses questions regarding the TOL in ways, that in my opinion,
should be significantly improved to be convincing.

Page 9 of 20

The authors begin by acknowledging that genetic evolution is largely reticulated in prokaryotes, but that
genetic and cellular evolution should be distinguished,
since, importantly, cellular evolution could be accurately
described by a tree.
They argue that the tree of cells could be reconstructed
by (i) considering the distribution of functions (e.g. the
repertoires of functions present in genomes) rather than
the repertoires of genes; and by (ii) giving a greater
weight to genes that are abundantly expressed in cells
(rather than giving similar weigth to all genes) to define
the branching pattern of cellular evolution. Genes with a
greater abundance, they propose, would be less easy to
transfer. In that regard, they introduce a novel (and possibly quite sound) 'complexity hypothesis' based on abundance. In the complexity hypothesis, genes with more
interactions are expected to be less transferred, in the
'abundant hypothesis', genes with the most abundant
expression are expected to be less transferred.
Whether the evolution of functions is tree-like as the
authors repeatedly claim could be tested by reconstructing a phylogenetic network based on the functional content of genomes. The authors should do it in a revised
version of the MS and add that analysis and a figure to
their paper. This test of the tree-like evolution of functions would improve the paper, since in some parts of
their manuscript, the authors mention the problematic
possibility that even functions evolution could be to some
extent affected by HGT (e.g. p.19). In particular, the
extent to which such repertoires of functions could be
convergent to adapt to some environments (i.e. animal
guts, or hypersaline environments) is probably partly an
open question, that could complicate the interpretation
of the branching pattern in such trees. Likewise, the
authors mention that indels (another type of slowly evolving characters, in their view less affected by HGT) appear
on the same points on a tree. It would be tempting as well
to see how a phylogenetic network of these data on indels
look (e.g. how tree-like the distribution of indels is), and
how it matches with the tree of functions.
Author's response:
We are arguing that the tree of function requires a well
developed tree of cells to define when lines of cells gained
or lost function. Our other work focuses on reconstructing
a large portion of the tree of cells, and hints of the tree of
function can be seen in it (in preparation). In the tree of
functions the source of the function does not matter. The
ancestral line did not have the function and the derived
group does, which is well described by a branch order on a
tree. Whether other branches on the tree have the same
function is irrelevant to those cells from a functional point
of view unless they are in competition. To really build the
tree of functions one would also need to represent the rela-

Valas and Bourne Biology Direct 2010, 5:44
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/44

tionships between different functions. We think the history
of cells, genomes, and functions are long term goals that
cannot begin to be reconstructed in a single figure, but we
hope we have argued they are goals worth pursuing still.
We agree it would be interesting to map characters such
as indels onto networks.
Gene abundance, especially in extinct cells, may be
quite difficult to quantify. The data are currently limited
to decide which genes are abundant and which ones are
not. Nonetheless, this limitation could be a chance, since
it should be possible to test whether these abundant
genes evolve vertically or not, by aligning these genes
(and corresponding controls) and by searching possible
traces of recombination in them, or evidence of inconsistent or odd branchings in their trees. Knowing whether
these genes appear to recombine/transfer in proportions
comparable with that of non abundant (control) genes
would help evaluating the authors' claim that abundantly
expressed genes are less affected by LGT. Such an analysis
should also be added to a revised version of this paper.
Indeed if molecular changes accumulate in these
sequences largely due to non vertical processes, at some
evolutionary depth, the proposition made by the authors
that such genes would better describe vertical evolution
than other markers (and thus should be preferred in case
of conflict between markers) would simply be wrong.
Author's response:
We have added an analysis of the inconsistency scores
for the highly abundant proteins. This data supports our
proposal that abundance is a barrier to horizontal transfer.
The authors' conclusions that the tree of functions
(should it be consistent with the data, once reconstructed) is a good proxy of the tree of cells, itself a perfect match of the Tree of Life, is very arguable. The tree of
functions, the tree of cells and the Tree of Life can hardly
be one same thing. They can hardly be considered isomorphic for a simple reason: they do not have the same
explanatory powers, nor the same explanatory scopes.
Evolution in general is much more than the evolution of
cells, or the evolution of functions (even if these two
aspects are very important to understand evolution). The
problem is that biological diversity resulting from evolution by far exceeds these two aspects: many evolutionary
units (recombined genes, operons, transferred genes,
mosaic genomes, consortia, communities, 'acellular' and
'intercellular evolution' mediated by mobile elements
such as phages and plasmids) cannot be exactly mapped
onto a tree of functions or onto a tree of cells. The evolutionary fates of these objects are partly (and sometimes
largely or totally) uncoupled with the ones described by
the tree of functions or by the tree of cells. The tree of
functions - if it can be reconstructed- would certainly be
informative about the evolution of functions; the tree of

Page 10 of 20

cells divisions - if it can be reconstructed- will be informative about a part of cellular evolution. However such a
tree of cell divisions won't inform us about most of what
cannot be considered as mere details in evolution: the
lifestyle, adaptation, processes creating and sustaining the
genetic diversity, the selection pressures at play and the
evolution of species (that is how remarkable groups of
organisms emerged (or failed to emerge) from the interplay of evolutionary processes).
Author's response:
You are absolutely right that each of these trees has different explanatory scopes. The tree of functions is certainly
not the tree of cells. Our argument is that tree-like thinking
is more useful when abstracting beyond the level of genetic
material. One would need to combine the tree of cells, tree
of functions, and networks of genomes to get the explanatory power of the dreamt TOL. We are not pattern
monists, so we have no problem with that.
We completely disagree that the trees of cells would not
be informative to studying adaptation. It might not provide much explanatory power on its own, but how can one
study adaptation without a history of the cell? The tree of
cells provides the snapshots of before and after the adaptive process. Mapping any other evolutionary data source
back onto the tree of cells makes it more informative.
Without the history you cannot say what any of the processes you listed actually changed in a cell. The bottom
line is the contribution of these other factors is always on
the tree of cells. That is why we argue the tree of cells
becomes more important under a pluralistic model.
This limited explanatory power of such a tree is even
clearly demonstrated in this manuscript: the 'cellular
core' of four spirochetes is already uninformative about
the Spirochetes lifestyles. Using these 'abundant genes'
would not allow explaining much of the spirochetes biology, and thus of these species origin (how some become
obligate parasites for instance). The duality between the
tree of cells and the network of genes, well acknowledged
by the authors, seems irreducible, because real and relevant to our understanding of evolution. In other words,
while the authors rigthly argue that the genome and the
cell should not be confused with one another, they seem
to be tempted to approximate the entire biology and the
entire evolution by the history of cell divisions. This confusion too should be discouraged.
Author's response:
The tree of function is not just the abundant genes; it
would include the losses and gains that define the adaptations to these different environments. We are not arguing
cell divisions are all that matter, but rather their history is
necessary for a true understanding of these other processes.
It would certainly be interesting to polarize in time
many evolutionary scenarios, but it does not follow that,

Valas and Bourne Biology Direct 2010, 5:44
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/44

based on the history of some genes with a slower dynamic
and based on some 'frozen' features, we will be able to
infer the independent histories of the other genes and of
the other organismal properties evolving with a distinct
(faster) pace. In that respect, knowing the tree of cell division might not help much in understanding precise gene
histories (for instance). A tree of cells will have some useful explanatory power but not as much as a dreamt TOL.
Author's response:
We agree that some genes histories will still not make
sense even in the framework of something that resembles
the TOL. Our point is that without some branch order for
the major prokaryotic groups it becomes difficult to come
up a meaningful history for ANY gene. The tree would let
us differentiate the slow and fast properties, which would
give great insight to evolutionary processes that are either
tree-like or network-like.
The authors' choice to keep using the phrase 'tree of life'
when referring to the pattern of common descent even if
it is more of a web, because this would somehow annoy
creationists, is in my opinion not a good idea. I do not
think creationists should dictate us any of our scientific
agenda, or influence our wording, as they have no scientific competence to evaluate evolutionary studies. When
phenomena are not tree-like, we should not call them a
tree. When they are tree-like and are supported by several lines of independent evidence, we should call them
the 'most corroborated evolutionary tree' or the 'best evolutionary tree' but not the tree of life, because maybe features did not evolve in a tree like fashion, and thus cannot
be reduced to that scheme to be fully understood.
Author's response:
If this was our only reason for this title you would be
absolutely correct. We have presented many reasons
besides this why we think 'tree of life' is a worthy title for
the combination of the histories of cells and genomes. It is
not about annoying creationists, which comes quite naturally to us. We agree that they should not dictate our
agenda, but clearly they have already shaped our wording.
The point is 150 years ago the phrase 'tree of life' invoked a
vision of a talking snake and a magic apple. Now it is a
story that involves genomes, viruses, and algorithms. The
meaning of the 'tree of life' will continue to evolve, but it
will continue to provide an explanation of where life came
from. We don't think any other title could ever have quite
the same aesthetic value, but beauty is in the eye of the
beholder.
There is then a cost to do as if the Tree of Life existed
(but not testing this scientific hypothesis): it reifies parts
of the tree, like the nodes and the branches. Lawrence
and Rechtless have masterfully shown that nodes, when
conceived as points of speciations, are not 'real'. When
prokaryotic species do not evolve by a series of dichoto-

Page 11 of 20

mies, it is a delusion to impose a dichotomy to describe a
speciation.
Author's response:
Lawrence and Retchless [45] have demonstrated that
nodes are fuzzy in terms of genetic material due to varying
levels of recombination during the divergence process. If
we consider a tree of functions then the nodes are real.
Consider an ancestral state that lacks a function. The
function is gained (through HGT or innovation). There is
now a derived and ancestral node that can be described on
a tree, but the history of their genetic material is no longer
so well behaved. Their may be a fuzzy functional intermediate, but that would not be a stable state due to selective
pressures. Again trees appear a better data structure if we
abstract past the genome.
The root poses a comparable issue. The authors keep
referring to LUCA, as if there were one one last universal
common ancestor of all life that was a cell. The literature
on early life is, to say the least, divided about this notion.
Invoking LUCA to prove that there is a tree, and the tree
to prove that there is a LUCA, without any principled way
(or any test) to refute that there is a LUCA or that there is
a tree is unfortunately a circular argument. That all cells
share a given gene/function does not mean that all cells
evolved vertically. If LUCA ever existed (which I doubt,
and most importantly which in my view could explain
more than a part of early evolution), how big was its
pangenome? What kind of mobile elements drove its evolution? We need to make sure that a prioris about the tree
and about LUCA being real do not already bias our conclusions, if these a prioris cannot be tested. Otherwise,
we might reinforce our habits of tree-thinkers, but not
necessarily our knowledge of evolution per se.
Author's response:
The issue of LUCA is certainly muddled in the literature. We direct the readers to a recent empirical argument
that there must have been a LUCA, even if it was a community [46]. You are right in pointing out we are biased in
our view of LUCA. Our other work has led us to support
Cavalier-Smith's assertion the Chloroflexi are the earliest
branching extant group. Therefore, we assume LUCA had
a relatively small pan genome. If one accepts the canonical
rooting between the Archaea and Bacteria the idea of a
large pan genomed LUCA is certainly more appealing
because of the large differences between the prokaryotic
superkingdoms. If LUCA was a large pan genome our
focus should be on what genes could NOT have been in
that community and must be younger than LUCA.
In that regards, I have a few detailed suggestions where
some simplifications could maybe be corrected in the
text.
p.3: The authors wrote: If every daughter cell's membrane kept track of who its parent was, reconstructing

Valas and Bourne Biology Direct 2010, 5:44
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/44

evolution would be a trivial task. I feel that this is a bit
misleading, it would inform us on a part of evolution: If
every daughter cell's membrane kept track of who its parent was, reconstructing evolution of cell divisions would
be a trivial task. It would not tell us anything on how species taxa, and genes, and phages, and communities, etc.
evolved.
Author's response:
A more precise statement, which we have adopted.
p.3: It is very arguable that even genomic evolution
makes little sense without the light of cellular evolution.
There is certainly lots of knowledge to be gained from
metagenomic analyses, from the study of mobile elements, from the study of gene evolution, lots of patterns
and processes to explain, even without the light of cellular
evolution. This is not to say that we would not benefit
from that particular light. But this light will mostly make
a 'genealogical' sense on evolution, and evolution is more
than genealogy.
Author's response:
Studying evolution without genealogy makes little sense
to us. These are all important processes, and we certainly
can learn a lot about them without the TOC. However, we
argue the TOC gives a deeper understanding of each of
them. Without considering genealogy in metagenomics one
basically has a laundry list of genes, and it might not even
be clear which of them are from the same cell. If one has
knowledge of how the cells in the community are related,
they can reconstruct the history of the mobile elements
and examine what their impact on the community was.
Likewise studying gene evolution without genealogy seems
limiting, as the impact the gene has is ultimately on the fitness of the cell. The genealogy is necessary to integrate
these processes into a bigger picture and to see what they
actually changed.
p.4: The TOL does not become even more important
under a pluralistic approach, quite the opposite: it is
regionalized under a pluralistic approach, as no single
model can explain everything about evolution under that
perspective. Finding the tree of cells for instance remains
an important and ambitious goal, but not the alpha and
omega of evolutionary research. The importance of the
TOL thus decreases while the importance of additional
interesting evolutionary questions increases.
Author's response:
We have changed this to TOC in the text. We are arguing building it is the alpha, but not the omega. The fact
that the TOC will be used to formulate more questions
than initially expected makes it more important.
p.5. It seems to me that proteins abundancy and core
cellular features might be a basal make-up of cellular lineages on which further adaptations are adjusted. If there
is some ratchet, abundant proteins can not be easily gotten rid of, but that does not mean that most of the evolu-

Page 12 of 20

tionary dynamic concerns these proteins and their coding
genes.
Author's response:
Evolution is certainly not just about the abundant genes.
We have included abundance data to add a dimension
beyond the genome to study the big picture in evolution.
p.5. Comparing how many of the same functions two
cells are doing at the same time is a good measure of similarity, but is it a good proxy of the genealogy ? This
depends on the amount of convergence and selective
pressures on functions induced by the environment. Is
not it possible that bacteria of the gut microbiomes (or of
a salty environment) will perform the same functions at
the same time even if they are not directly related ?
Author's response:
This is certainly a vital question to answer. Abundance
data from similar environments will allow us to test this in
the future, but for now we are left to speculate.
p. 6. For a detailed argument that a TOL is not as meaningful as claimed in [13], when there is a large incongruence between individual gene trees, see Bapteste et al.
Biol Direct. 2009 Sep 29;4:34. Prokaryotic evolution and
the tree of life are two different things.
Author's response:
We lean towards your arguments in this case unless one
can deal with the incongruence in a non-arbitrarily manner as we have proposed here.
p.11: I absolutely disagree with the following statement:
Trees have many shortcomings for representing prokaryotic evolution, but any data structure that lacks temporality is even worse. Reconstructing a wrong tree (imposing
an irrelevant structure to the data because of our a prioris) is the worst thing one can do. We can learn a lot from
unrooted gene trees, on which by definition there is no
temporality.
Author's response:
We mean that we need the benefits of the trees we have
listed, while trying to accommodate the shortcomings of
that representation. We are not for forcing data to fit the
tree. We are saying the data that does not fit the tree can
only be noticed and studied once you have the tree. There
are certainly other representations that are useful, but the
TOC is necessary for weaving them into a coherent story.
p. 18 and p. 19: When commenting on dualities, the
text becomes pretty metaphysical in places. I do not see
why 'the' light must be 'the TOL': a light can be a tree of
cells, another light a tree of functions, and so on. Why do
you need only one light to explore the darkness of evolution anyway, while so many processes are occuring, creating a diversity of phenomena that calls for more than one
explanation ?
Author's response:
We think a discussion of the metaphor used to represent
the process of life should have a healthy dose of metaphys-

Valas and Bourne Biology Direct 2010, 5:44
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/44

ics. The nice thing about yin and yang is that you can
switch them and it still tells the same story. We have chosen light because in this case the answer the TOL provides
(if it exists) is more directly readable than the WOL. There
should be multiple lights, but we cannot see how anything
could be more useful to understanding the history of genes
than understanding the history of cells. These are the two
primary replicative processes in evolution. The assumption they were the same process is the source of the problem. As we begin to separate them we must keep them
connected. Therefore we feel the yin and yang is fitting.
One could argue the confusion caused by forcing data to
fit a tree is the darkness and the light is the realization of
processes like HGT. The point is that HGT and the TOC
are inseparable and cannot exist without the other,
regardless of how we label each one.
A thinking about evolution in terms of yin and yang is
possibly not entailed by the quote on (I believe) Darwin's
malthusianism. I doubt that historians of sciences and/or
philosophers of sciences would be convinced that this is a
proper use of that particular quote. I do not think it is
needed in the paper.
Author's response:
We probably did go a bit too far in our use of this quote.
We have softened the implications, but have kept the
quote. We see the yin and yang in that quote, as well as in
the data, regardless of what Darwin was thinking when he
wrote it.
p.18: I disagree with this sentence: A web of life may be
more factual than a single TOL, but we argue it is a less
accurate depiction of life's history.. The authors possibly
have in mind a fairly simple web of shared genes. But
even these graphs can be further studied to gain knowledge on history. Dagan and Martin for instance have
shown how such networks can be exploited to learn
about life's history. And what about phylogenetic networks for taxa with a limited amount of HGT: are they
worse than a tree to describe life's history? To me this
kind of claim is counterproductive, as it fails to acknowledge that it might just be time to change our habits and
our thinking about how evolution should be described.
Author's response:
We are making a similar point to the one you made
above about explanatory power. The WOL does explain as
much as the dreamt TOL. Therefore we would be settling
for too little if we thought it was enough.
I also would like to make some further precisions:
p.2. The conclusion of Doolittle and Bapteste is not so
much that the inability to build the tree is the problem,
rather it is forcing the data into a tree that needs to be
questionned, and in a pluralistic framework, avoided,
since this model does not allow a precise description of
the evolutionary processes.

Page 13 of 20

Author's response:
Changed.
p.17: The authors write that it is not clear what level of
genome conservation between strains of prokaryotes
would be satisfying enough to consider them evolving in
a tree-like manner. It is true that two strains of the same
species may have relatively few genes in common, but we
have argued above this is probably an exaggeration of
functional distance. Even if the second sentence might be
correct, its association with the first one suggest that the
authors tend to overlook the importance of recombination in prokaryotic genomes, a major process that is not
tree-like. This non-tree like phenomenon can in part be
masked by zooming out at a higher taxonomical level,
still the real processes responsible for evolution are not
tree-like. In that respect, a tree of cells or a tree of functions will fall short in explaining major evolutionary processes at play on genomes.
Author's response:
We are trying to emphasize the many tree-like patterns
that could be masked by recombination of genetic material. Certainly a network is needed to understand the history of the genome. Our key point is that does not mean a
network necessarily describes the evolution of cellular
function better even in the presence of recombination.
p.17: Just like genomes simply are not enough to study
genomics, cells (or functions) are not enough to study
evolution: you need to include phages, plasmids, etc.
Author's response:
True, but in reality phages and plasmids only really
affect evolution when they enter cells.
p.19: The duality that the authors propose between
HGT that shape evolution and HGT that confound our
tree building algorithms seems a distinction between
good and bad HGTs. This distinction (if it can be
achieved, how ?) could help them building an evolutionary tree, but it would not make the processes of evolution
and prokaryotic genetic evolution more tree-like in
nature. Both good and bad HGTs are non strictly vertical
processes.
Author's response:
This distinction can only be made by having a hypothetical ancestral genome before the transfer occurred, which
is not a trivial task is given the amount of transfers that
have occurred. If the function is novel to the recipient cells
lets call it a good HGT. In both cases there is non-tree like
evolution, but we argue that bad HGTs are just red herrings leading us away from the tree that does exist. Our
point is that HGTs are not strictly non vertical from a
functional perspective.
Overall, in many places of the MS the authors could
advantageously replace TOL by Tree of Cells, which
would address (simply) most of my concerns.

Author's response:
Calling the TOL a universal sequence tree in much of the
current literature would have addressed many of our concerns as well, but your arguments have convinced us TOC
is more precise in several places. We think a compromise is
to use the term TOL to refer to the combination of the network of genomes and tree of cells. It would not be entirely a
tree, but it would have nearly same explanatory power as
the original TOL hypothesis. We hope this work adds precision to these terms instead of just muddying the waters.
To sum up, I feel that the current title of the manuscript
is misleading, unnecessarily dramatic, and should be
modified.
The title is meant to be dramatic. We have explained
what mean by 'lost in the woods' a little better in the introduction. Now that we have changed TOL to TOC in many
places we explain the title as rescuing the explanatory
power of the TOL by remembering the WOL needs to be
grounded in the TOC. We feel the need to be dramatic
because many appear ready to abandon the TOC because
it is confused with the TOL.
What this MS proposes is how a tree of cellular functions, equated with the tree of cells, could possibly be
reconstructed by taking into account additional (novel)
sources of data (such as the functional repertoire of
genomes and the abundance of expressed genes in the
cells) rather than by focusing on the mere gene content of
genomes, and by giving comparable weights to the phylogenetic signal(s) of each individual gene.
The Tree of Life and the tree of cells are however two
different things: in particular they do not offer similar
explanations of evolution. The tree of cells is by definition
more limited in its scope than the legendary Tree of Life.
It is then important to stress that the tree that could be
saved if the author's proposition hold is (and that is
already quite good) either the tree of functions or the tree
of cells.
The title also suggests that evolutionary biologists
would be lost without this one tree. I think this claim is
unduly pessimistic, and stems from our acquired habits
to explain evolution with a tree model. Evolutionary biologists won't be lost without the tree of life: they will be
challenged. They will need to reconsider their practices,
their goals, and their explanatory toolkits to make sense
of an evolution that is not just tree-like.
There are lots of fascinating researches to be done to
learn about the evolutionary processes and mechanisms,
that do not require the inference of a unique tree of life,
i.e. to harvest the phylogenetic forest of unrooted trees
(see Lapointe et al. Trends in Micro, in press), or to
exploit genome networks (see Dagan and Martin's works;
Fani, Fondi et al.'s works, Lima-Mendez, Leplae et al.'s or
Halary et al.'s works). Our explanations will be different,
but evolutionary biologists won't be out of job or hope-

Page 14 of 20

less. Such a possibility could/should have been explored
more by the authors, as they reckon that it is not clear
what our expectation of prokaryote should be. Precisely,
clarifying this expectation, with the least possible a prioris, is an exciting prospect for evolutionary science.
Author's response:
Processes and mechanisms are certainly important, but
evolution is about history to us. We only care about the
mechanisms and processes because they caused the history. You cannot understand the mechanisms or processes
without the history. We certainly believe that networks
have a lot to teach us, but they only are meaningful when
grounded in a TOC. Therefore the TOC becomes more
important as we try to understand the processes that do
not fit into that scheme.
This is why I finally beg all authors who might be
tempted to send me some more papers to review on
themes such as 'rescuing the TOL' or 'saving the TOL' in a
near future not to: I have definitely said all I had to say on
that issue for a little while, and it is time for me to move
on more exciting research topics ?.
Author's response:
We sincerely thank you for one last round on this subject. Unfortunately for you, your insightful review of this
manuscript will probably make others want to continue
this discussion with you. But we understand the need to
move on from this topic.
Additional specific comments
Further questions

p.8: Do large pangenomes have larger repertoires of functions ? If so, won't that affect the reconstruction of a tree
of functions ?
Author's response:
A large pangenome may have a large amount of functional redundancy. This will not be a problem if one has a
good functional outgroup, but that requires a well defined
TOC.
p. 9: Why should we assume that COGs that are the
most widely distributed in extant taxa are the most
ancient ones? Why can not they be highly transferred ?
Author's response:
You are right that some of these could be the result of frequent transfers. To the best of our knowledge there is no
case of a young protein being transferred to the majority of
a superkingdom, but there are many proteins clearly in the
ancestor of a superkingdom that have been retained.
Therefore in general the most widely distributed proteins
are the oldest. It seems we would need the tree of cells, tree
of functions, and network of genomes to be certain though,
so for now this is a reasonable estimate.
p. 19: The fact that a large chunk of universal cellular
function has remained conserved and its sequence
behaves in a mostly tree-like manner after billions of

Valas and Bourne Biology Direct 2010, 5:44
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/44

years earns it the title of TOL in our opinion. How is this
a fact ? How has this been tested ?
Author's response:
We have changed this one to TOCs to soften it. We are
calling the 5% of the 'abundome' represented by the universal proteins a large chunk, which is certainly arguable.
However, this number increase if one considers the functional content of the last common ancestor of each superkingdom instead. The nearly universal trees in [22] have a
high level of consistency. Therefore, we think this statement is justified in its current form.
Unclear sentences

p.1. 'results': What do you mean by proper selective context ?
Author's response:
Differentiating between whether it is a good or bad horizontal transfer.
p.2. Why should the woods be 'woods of neutral evolution' ?
Author's response:
Because we believe most of the noise coming from HGT
are actually just displacements.
p.5. What do you mean by: The downside of abundance
is it is dynamic, while genomes are static. ? What timeline/evolutionary scale do you have in mind ? At the TOL
level, genomes are very dynamic.
Author's response:
It is true on evolutionary time scales genomes are
dynamic. We mean within a single cell.
p. 12: This entire section: The disagreement between
these phylogenies is not in terms of how to define the
major taxa but rather in the proper way to polarize the
data, especially the indels (insertion deletions) which we
have discussed [34]. However, the distribution of these
traits themselves implies specific taxa evolved before
another, regardless of the direction of each polarization.
For example, there is a large insert in HSP70 (heat shock
protein 70) that is present across the Gram-negative bacteria, but absent in the Gram-positives. One form of the
protein must have predated the other. There is no reason
to assume all the informative indels were fixed early in
evolution, and one would be very hard pressed to draw a
detailed scenario of transfers that explains their distribution better than a more timeline like structure. is unclear,
and should be somehow rewritten. If this is a philosophical point (rather than an empirical comment on the data
distribution), I would say that the best explanations are
not necessarily the ones that match a tree, these latter are
only the simplest explanations. When irrelevant, they do
not help much.
Author's response:
This is an empirical comment. We arguing if HGT was
truly so rampant as to annihilate any trace of the TOC it
should not be possible to find independent traits that sup-

Page 15 of 20

port these phylogenies. We have rewritten it to try to make
our point clearer. We see no need to invoke a more complicated explanation if the simple one works.
p.13: Abundance data may make it possible to quantify
what Simpson coined "quantum evolution" when referring to the metazoan fossil record [35] on a molecular
level in prokaryotes. This sentence needs to be developped or better explained (as it is I do not recognize
Simpson's theory - that gives a main role to the environmental selection in quantum evolution- if I recall correctly, as a particularly valid analogy here).
Author's response:
We have inherited our use of this term from CavalierSmith. To be precise we mean events where there is a domino effect across numerous proteins that results in rapid
evolution. We are arguing that if some major change in
abundance was tolerated by rapidly shifting the abundance of other proteins it would very difficult to resolve
with sequence data regardless of HGT, p. 16: This highly
finctional sentence makes no sense whatsoever to me: We
think the TOL crisis would be worse if it was the "tree of
99%", as it would be quite difficult to explain the phenotypic differences between humans and E. coli. It is
remarkable any genes are conserved since LUCA, and
therefore the TOL still rings true to us.
Author's response:
We are saying there tree of 1% argument makes no sense
without a null hypothesis. This purely fictional sentence is
an example of another tree we could be dealing with that
would cause a different set of problems. Put another way,
what% did the community expect to be conserved before
genomic sequences were available and why?
Typos

p. 2: Bapteste is spelled strangely.
p.17: But since expression is highly correlated without
evolutionary rates [38] Do you mean 'with' not without,
don't you ?
p.19, first line: a word is missing before 'has'.
Author's response:
We have corrected all of these.

USA.
I have read the manuscript by Valas and Bourne with
considerable interest, wholeheartedly agreeing with several ideas in it and disagreeing with some. The best home
for this study is probably in the Opinion category within
Biology Direct - this is not really a research paper.
Author's response:
We feel the paper is both research and opinion, and
hopefully it will fit fine in either category.

Valas and Bourne Biology Direct 2010, 5:44
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/44

There are two main themes, one of which is more of a
research proposal, the other more of a philosophy-of-science talking point. The research proposal is essentially to
enhance the utility of genic traits by assigning weights to
them - the weights which, directly or indirectly, estimate
relative contribution of each gene to the phenotype; if I
understand the proposal correctly, the significance of the
phylogenetics signal can therefore be reordered by the
"functional rank" of the sequence from which this signal
was obtained. I think this is a good proposal, and Adami/
Wilke and Koonin's groups, among others, have already
said a lot about gene "relative importance"; important
technical details of all that have not been worked out,
however. The more methodological question, of what to
make out of the purported lack of tree-like signal, or of
the Doolittle and Bapteste's "pattern pluralism" and other
related proposals, is also of interest, and my intuition
runs close to the author's, but I still think that he is led
astray by the setups of the problem in the literature.
In more detail, much of the "conceptual" literature on
the HGT is hand waving about "rampant", "massive" etc.
aspects of horizontal transfer. This usually refers to the
large number of events observed in a particular dataset,
but generally fails to acknowledge that this high number
of events usually accounts for a small proportion of the
genes in the dataset and correspondingly relatively low
average ratio of horizontal to vertical branches in the
trees. (Ninety-nine percent of the trees, for example, may
show some evidence of HGT, but in the vast majority of
these trees, there may be just one or very few HGT
events, and so on; see, e.g., Pubmed 19077245, 18062816
and 15799709). Thus, instead of talking about the applicability of the TOL "metaphor", perhaps we should be
talking about TOL quantitative model, the alternatives to
it, and which model or mixed model is best compatible
with the data.
Author's response:
We agree with your sentiment towards these results. We
are all for a mixed model, but it needs to be a true duality
where cells and genomes are treated as such, instead of
just a reticulated network of genomes.
The author states about Doolittle and Bapteste's proposal: "A key point of their work is that any data can be
forced to fit a tree, even if that representation of the data
makes no sense" - in fact, this has been known for a long
time; the same can be said about any representation of
the evolutionary process (e.g., alignment algorithm will
align even unrelated sequences, and network algorithm
will build a network even on a hierarchical set of OTUs);
and finally, so what?
Author's response:
We have changed this sentence to one suggested by Eric
Bapteste in his review. The other two examples you bring
up are valid. It is easy to forget the results of high powered

Page 16 of 20

computing tools we have still are prone to 'garbage in garbage out'. Some alignments are probably forced to fit, but
the authors are saying ALL universal trees are forced to fit.
It took their persuasive argument to demonstrate how
forced many of the genome trees are. It is the scale of the
problem that makes their work worthwhile.
In other words, the author should stop fighting the
windmills: the goal of phylogenetics should not be to
build a tree, nor to build any graph with another kind of
predetermined topology, but to improve our understanding of which evolutionary events actually happened and
led to the observed data. I think this accommodates "pattern pluralism" naturally.
Author's response:
We agree, but one must have some data structure in
mind when designing algorithms and strategies to reconstruct these histories. We feel trees capture the history of
the events better, and that is needed to supplement the
networks to get anywhere.
I would advise to the author to get all this out of the way
early and to focus on the relatively independent proposal
of including protein abundance and other information
(such as perhaps correlated essentiality and degree of
conservation) into the judgement of importance or relevance of any particular tree topology for phylogenetics. I
would like to see the discussion of several points in more
detail.
Author's response:
We'd rather let the reader see our wild speculation and
eastern symbolism after a little well grounded research.
1. "A cumulative plot of genomic and cellular abundance reveals that at every level genomic abundance
underestimates cellular abundance" - so what does this
tell us about phylogeny? Also, the datasets that are available to us are full of parasitic microorganisms whose
genomes may be experiencing net gene loss, which contributes to the reduction of the "genomic abundance" of
almost all categories of genes. Would the picture change
if we focus on free-living/saprotrophic organisms?
Author's response:
This implies that when a large group of trees is in agreement about phylogeny that forest is a large portion of those
cells. That makes the phylogeny more historically real to
us. It would certainly be interesting to focus on abundance
in parasites and their free living relatives. We assume that
most of genes they retain would be highly abundant proteins in free living cells, and they mostly streamline what is
usually necessary to power that core. That would be consistent with higher levels of conservation when measured
by protein versus genomic abundance in the spirochete
data set, but more data here would certainly be informative.
2. The authors want to rescue the tree by bringing in
the functional importance/protein abundance (pheno-

Valas and Bourne Biology Direct 2010, 5:44
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/44

type), as discussed before. In this case, would not the
change of function be equivalent to a HGT, and would
this be less or more often than a true genetic HGT?
Author's response:
Functional changes are never neutral, and we argue
HGTs are neutral most of the time so they are not equivalent. It is hard to speculate on the frequency of such events
because so there are so many ORFans in sequenced
genomes, and so many proteins beyond that which have
not been functionally characterized. If that portion of
genomic space represents nuanced novel functions they
could be more frequent than HGT. We think this is exactly
the sort of question that requires both a tree and a network
to answer properly.
Reviewer's report 3

Celine Brochier, Laboratoire de Chimie Bactérienne,
CNRS-Aix Marseille Université, 31 Chemin Joseph
Aiguier, 13402 Marseille Cedex 20, France
In this paper Valas and Bourne propose an original
approach to reconstruct the tree of life.
To my point of view this contribution is more an opinion than an experimental paper. This is at odds with the
organisation of the paper that includes a large "results"
section (11 pages), whereas the real experimental part of
the work is represented by a single figure and one paragraph (1 page). By contrast, the discussion" section is
rather short (3 pages). I think it would be more appropriate to combine the results and the discussion sections
into a single section, with subdivisions corresponding to
the different points that are discussed. Finally, I think it is
important to clearly classify this manuscript as an opinion and not as an experimental paper.
Author's response:
We have combined the results and discussion as suggested. We agree that this paper is not a traditional
research paper, but we still feels it belongs in that category
as it is a combination of novel research, opinion, and
review.
The contribution of Valas and Bourne comes within the
scope of the hot debate around the Tree Of Life (TOL).
Indeed, based on genomic data the suitability of tree-like
structures to represent the evolutionary history of all
organisms has been highly debated [4,8,47]. The two
main arguments are that in prokaryotes (1) the evolutionary history of genes is different from the evolutionary history of organisms because of horizontal gene transfers
(HGT) [4], and (2) HGT may be so frequent that a substantial part of the genes in a genome have been affected
by HGT. Then, jumping from genomes to organisms
(perhaps because we have entered in a "too genomic-centric" area, as stated by the authors), this has led to the
conclusion that, at least for prokaryotes, a tree-like structure does not reflect the evolution of genomes, which will

Page 17 of 20

be better represented by a network (NOG, Network Of
Genes). However, if nobody can deny that HGT have
played an important role in evolution (and not only in
prokaryotes), it is also undisputable that cell division in
prokaryotes occurs by the division of a mother cell in two
daughter cells. It is therefore theoretically possible to
trace-back the history of cell lineages and to represent it
with a tree-like structure, the TOL. However, the TOL
and the NOG are often confounded, maybe because
genes are the only informational entities that are transmitted from one generation to another, whereas TOL and
NOG represent two different things that are equally
interesting and highly complementary to understand the
evolution of living organisms [5,14]. The authors state
these points well by writing: "All of the issues the community is currently having with the TOL hypothesis stem
from the simple fact that genomes are not perfect representation of membrane history. [...] even genomic evolution
makes little sense without the light of cellular evolution".
The challenge is now to reconstruct the TOL in a NOG
context. Classical approaches consist to identify (and to
analyse) the sets of genes that may be used to reconstruct
the different parts of TOL. This step is important because
it appears a utopia to think that it is possible to fully
resolve the TOL (from the root to the leaves) based on the
analysis of a few universal genes. This would be the tree
of 1%. In fact, it would be cleaver to divide the problem by
looking at the set of genes suitable to reconstruct different parts of the TOL. For example, the set of genes suitable to resolve the phylogeny of animals will probably be
different to the set of genes that may be used to trace back
the relationships within Methanococcales (Archaea).
This is well known by botanists and zoologists who used
different sets of characters for different levels of their
classifications. Ideally, the TOL should be a synthetic
drawing showing the relationships between organisms
(not species, which are artificial entities, or genomes) by
combining the results obtained by the phylogenetic analyses of different sets of genes. In this case, the TOL will
not be the tree of 1% but the tree of dozens of percents,
each gene contributing to resolve some parts of the TOL.
Here the authors propose a radically different approach
based on the vertical inheritance of functions rather than
on the vertical inheritance of genetic material. The
approach is based on the assumption that all genes do not
contribute equally to the cell: some are more important
than others. The authors underline that the gene contribution to the cell should be an important criterion to take
into account when reconstructing the TOL. As the
authors point out there are different metrics to measure
the gene contribution to a cell: "essentiality, abundance of
proteins, number of transcripts, portion of total weight,
etc".

Valas and Bourne Biology Direct 2010, 5:44
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/44

1) My first question is how to organize these factors in a
hierarchy, i.e. which criterion is the more suitable to represent protein importance in a cell? And what do these
factors exactly represent from an evolutionary point of
view? Is it possible to develop evolutionary models for
such data (that are mainly quantitative and not discrete
characters)? Unfortunately the authors do not propose
methodological approaches to analyse such data. I think
this is important to discuss about their suitability to
reconstruct the TOL.
Among these factors, the authors chose to study the
abundance of proteins in cells (the "adundome"). Based
on recently published data on the abundance of proteins
present in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli cells (GammaProteobacteria) and of the complete proteome of Leptospira interrogans (Spirochaetes), the authors argue that
"abundance is a good proxy for evolutionary importance
because there is a correlation between the abundance of a
protein and the energy the cell invests into producing it".
Author's response:
We do not have precise answers for these questions, but
they are certainly going to be important to answer. Our
demonstration that abundance is a barrier to transfer
supports the notion it is evolutionary important. But there
are abundant genes that have been transferred. It would
be naïve to say those are less important. It might not be
possible to precisely quantify how important each gene is
to the cell, but we have demonstrated that in general the
important genes evolve in a more tree-like manner. We are
hopeful it will be possible to develop evolutionary models
for the evolution of "abundomes", but we doubt they will
behave well enough to resolve the TOL or TOC on their
own. Rather we think they will be tools to help us understand how the TOC was shaped. In either case it would
certainly be premature to begin developing these methods
from the two datasets currently available as they are not
directly comparable. A sampling of many strains of E. coli
seems like a good place to start addressing these ideas.
2) This raises my second question: what does the "evolutionary importance" of a protein mean from an evolutionary point of view? The word "importance" is a
subjective and indefinite criterion. The abundance is one
side of the importance, essentiality is another. Indeed, a
protein may be important even if it is not abundant in a
cell (e.g. transcription regulators). The authors should
discuss more this point.
Author's response:
Importance is certainly a subjective term. We are not
arguing that abundance is a perfect representation of
importance but it is seems to be a straightforward and
objective measure. We argue that as we measure the
importance of function in some meaningful way the
importance of HGT will begin to shrink, and the vertical
component will grow in size.

Page 18 of 20

3) More problematic, and this is partially raised by the
authors, the abundance of a protein is a dynamic parameter that may vary across cells depending for example of
their lifestyle. More importantly, for a given cell the relative abundance of its proteins may vary in time, depending for example on the developmental state reached (e.g.
cells in exponential growth or in stationary phase, etc) or
environmental conditions. How to take this difficulty into
account?
Author's response:
There are certainly going to be many difficulties in using
abundance data. We argue the proteins that remain
abundant under a variety of conditions are probably the
most important, but surely there will be many interesting
caveats to discover as more data become available. Again,
we are not suggesting using this data to build phylogenetic
trees, but rather as a tool to better understand the ones
created from other data sources.
4) I think the large paragraph on indels and the timing
of appearance of prokaryotic phyla should be removed
because it is beyond the scope of the paper, and I am
afraid that the reader will loose grasp on the logical succession of ideas. Same remark for the paragraph dealing
with protein structures. On the contrary, I think the
authors should rather focus on their proposal to use
"abundome" to reconstruct the TOL and in particular on
the methodological aspects.
Author's response:
We are not arguing the "abundome" data can reconstruct the TOC, but we think the indels and quaternary
structures can. In some sense we are using abundance
data to show the phylogenies created using other data
sources are meaningful despite the arguments against the
TOL. Most of these arguments are against sequence based
methods, so we think it is appropriate to include our other
work as a demonstration the TOC is still evolutionary
meaningful and can still be resolved.
5) Finally, I have a few comments regarding assumptions that are made on phylogenetic studies based on
gene sequence analyses. The authors say that "current
methods for estimating HGT rely on measuring inconsistencies between sequence trees or looking for unusual compositional features, so there is no way for them to
distinguish between innovations and displacements". I
think this statement should be toned down because, in
the case of phylogenetic studies, most of the time a careful examination of trees allows discriminating between
gene acquisition and gene replacement. This is for example the case for aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (that are
discussed in the paper), where clear cases of gene replacements can be identified.
Author's response:
The aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are a special case
because the combination of their trees and knowledge of

Valas and Bourne Biology Direct 2010, 5:44
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/44

the essentiality of their function implies these are displacements. It is much more difficult to conclude that from the
trees alone. It is not impossible to discriminate between
these scenarios, but it seems like many do not seem to
worry about the difference when looking at forests of phylogenetic trees.
Very minor points:
I do not understand the sentence "We argue events like
this are far more deleterious to tree reconstruction algorithms than they are to the recipient cells."
Author's response:
We feel that sequence has persisted as the primary tool
to study evolution because of the relative ease algorithms
can represent it, as opposed to these other sources of data.
Again we are trying to emphasize the difference between
displacement and innovation needs to be made by including other data sources.
The legend of Figure 1 is poorly understandable.
I did not understand the last sentence of the abstract.
Author's response:
See our reply to Eric Bapteste
I disagree with the allusions to Darwin in the discussion
section "There is clearly a duality in Darwin's theory of
descent with modification; the history of variation is well
described by a network and the history of selection is well
described by a tree". First, this sentence is not clear. Second the history of variation may be represented by a tree:
for example, the evolutionary history of a gene (irrespective to HGT) may be depicted by a tree and it is possible
to indicate on each branch the mutations that occurred,
and therefore to follow the history of variation of this
gene.
Author's response:
We are speaking in very general terms. Your example is
correct, but the variation of organisms is in terms of their
entire genomes. The gene cannot really be selected for
independently of the rest of the cell and genome, so the
variation is relative to them as well. It was assumed for a
long time the history of these two processes is the same,
and we think it has become time to explicitly separate
them.
