Environmental distribution of prokaryotic taxa
Javier Tamames1,2,4*, Juan José Abellán1,2, Miguel Pignatelli1,2, Antonio Camacho3, Andrés Moya1,2

Abstract
Background: The increasing availability of gene sequences of prokaryotic species in samples extracted from all
kind of locations allows addressing the study of the influence of environmental patterns in prokaryotic biodiversity.
We present a comprehensive study to address the potential existence of environmental preferences of prokaryotic
taxa and the commonness of the specialist and generalist strategies. We also assessed the most significant
environmental factors shaping the environmental distribution of taxa.
Results: We used 16S rDNA sequences from 3,502 sampling experiments in natural and artificial sources. These
sequences were taxonomically assigned, and the corresponding samples were also classified into a hierarchical
classification of environments. We used several statistical methods to analyze the environmental distribution of
taxa. Our results indicate that environmental specificity is not very common at the higher taxonomic levels
(phylum to family), but emerges at lower taxonomic levels (genus and species). The most selective environmental
characteristics are those of animal tissues and thermal locations. Salinity is another very important factor for
constraining prokaryotic diversity. On the other hand, soil and freshwater habitats are the less restrictive
environments, harboring the largest number of prokaryotic taxa. All information on taxa, samples and
environments is provided at the envDB online database, http://metagenomics.uv.es/envDB.
Conclusions: This is, as far as we know, the most comprehensive assessment of the distribution and diversity of
prokaryotic taxa and their associations with different environments. Our data indicate that we are still far from
characterizing prokaryotic diversity in any environment, except, perhaps, for human tissues such as the oral cavity
and the vagina.

Background
The patterns of species distribution and diversity, which
are fairly well-known for macroorganisms, are not altogether understood for microorganisms. Some ecological
trends that have already been observed for macroorganisms, such as taxa-area or distance-decay relationships
[1], and especially the existence of biogeographical patterns, have been proposed to possibly exist also for
microorganisms, thus pointing to the existence of common, global rules that govern the ecology of all living
forms. Some analyses support the ubiquity of several
prokaryotic species [2,3], but also the apparent existence
of biogeographic patterns for some others [3-7].
The study of ecological trends in microorganisms has
been traditionally hampered by different factors. First,

the methods used to catalogue microbial diversity
(mostly based on sequencing the 16S rDNA gene) are
expensive, time-consuming, biased and inadequate for
massive screening, although technologic advances in
DNA sequencing technology can change this picture dramatically [8-10]. Another serious problem is the lack of a
proper concept of prokaryote species. The current definition is mainly based on genotypic characteristics, such as
the percentage of DNA-DNA hybridization or the percentage of identity between the 16S rDNA molecules
[11]. However, this approach is known to group rather
different strains together which should probably be considered as different species (as in Escherichia coli), or to
separate organisms with an almost identical gene complement (as in the genus Bacillus). The ongoing debate
on this topic includes the proposal that similarity in lifestyle, and not just in genes, is the best approach to classify microorganisms [12,13]. Similar ecological and
metabolic features are scattered through different clades
among the prokaryotic world, conforming specific

metabolic groups of prokaryotes, such as the different
metabolic types of sulfur bacteria [14]. Polyphasic
approaches [15], including an overview on genotypic,
phenotypic, and ecological features, would be necessary
to better understand the global distribution of prokaryotes. But in practice, most studies simply use the socalled Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) [16]
obtained, for instance, by grouping 16rDNA genes at the
97-98% threshold of identity, as a way to circumvent the
absence of an adequate definition of species [17].
Also the massive number of existing species makes
cataloguing microbial diversity difficult [18]. Most sampling efforts miss present species, which, in some cases,
can produce an inadequate picture of the patterns that
underlie community structure [1].
Furthermore, knowledge about the most determining
factors that shape the distribution of bacteria in the different environments is still limited. It is quite usual to
ascribe whole bacterial clades to a single environment
by identifying them as for instance, marine or terrestrial.
Should we make this simple categorization? Could this
not be a consequence of our incomplete and biased
knowledge of the different environments and taxa? To
study ecological trends, it is important to count on an
accurate description of habitats and, accordingly, it
would be most helpful to adopt standardized descriptions for the environmental characteristics of the samples. An interesting initiative in this direction is being
carried out with the development of the MIGS/MIMS
(minimum information about a genomic/metagenomic
sequence) specifications by the Genomic Standards Consortium [19].
Nowadays, however, there are a big number of studies
inspecting the presence of particular taxa in different
environments. The analysis of the presence of taxa in
different environments for which many samples
are available is a valuable approach to in part overcome
some of the limitations pointed above. The use of these
data may allow to obtaining conclusions on how environmental features and taxa-specific properties influence
the patterns of microbial distribution.
In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of
the relationships between individual prokaryotic taxa
and different environments, in an attempt to cover two
main objectives: firstly, to describe the environmental
distribution of taxa, in order to explore the existence of
environmental preferences for taxa and the commonness
of specialists (environment-specific species) and generalists (ubiquitous, cosmopolitan species), at different taxonomic levels (from phyla to species); second, to describe
environmental variation according to taxa distribution
in an attempt to ascertain common features between
different environments and to determine the most significant environmental characteristics. In both cases, we

show the most remarkable trends that could orientate
future studies on these issues. Although partially similar
studies were performed in the past [20], this is, as far as
we know, the most comprehensive assessment of the
environmental distribution and diversity of prokaryotic
taxa.

Results
Previous references have attempted to characterize the
patterns of distribution and diversity of some taxa by
proposing, for instance, the existence of environmentspecific taxa, or even whole clades [5,21]. But some of
these results may have been greatly influenced by the
coarse-grained resolution of the environmental classification used, especially by a limited number of samples
which can obscure the real patterns of taxonomic distribution and diversity. To obtain results that are as accurate and complete as possible, we used the complete set
of environmental samplings stored in the GenBank database, each of which contains a variable number of 16S
rDNA sequences found at the corresponding locations.
This set of environmental data is probably the richest
available source of information on the distribution of
prokaryotic organisms and, to our knowledge, has not
been used as a whole before. By exploring a high number of samples from a given environment, we expect to
increase the statistical power to detect patterns in
sequence diversity for that environment.
It is sensible to think that patterns of ecological and
metabolic diversity may depend on the specific level of
taxonomic and environmental resolution. In this study
we have considered all possible taxonomic ranks, from
phyla to species, in order to explore how the trends
change with taxonomic resolution (in some instances,
the results are detailed and discussed for the family
taxonomic rank). Likewise, we have created a novel classification of environments composed of three nested
levels of environment classes with increasing resolutions
(Table 1). Each sample is classified using this scheme.
The sequences from the samples have been grouped
into OTUs using a threshold of 97% identity, and have
been taxonomically classified at the deepest possible
level. Because we can identify the taxa present in each
of the environmentally classified samples, we can
address the study of the relationships between taxa and
environments.
First, we determined the abundance of each taxon in
all the environments, to study the patterns of specificity
and cosmopolitanism. The results are shown in Figure
1. If we define a specificity criterion as having 90% or
more of their observations in a single environment
(which can be very restrictive depending on the resolution of habitat classification), the apparent trend is to
increase it with taxonomic depth. Higher taxonomic

Hierarchical classification of environments composed of three nested levels of resolution (supertype, type and subtype), showing also the number of samples,
OTUs and individual sequences in each.

ranks (phylum, class, order and family) have approximately the low specificity percentages, while for genera
and especially species there is a clear increase in the
amount of specific taxa. Nevertheless, the percentage of
specific species does not even reach 20% for the most
favourable case of environment supertypes (using 90%
for the specificity criterion, Figure 1). Some of these
species belong to well-known examples of specificity,
such as the marine bacteria Prochlorococcus marinus
and Pelagibacter ubique. These taxa are thought to be
amongst the most abundant microorganisms in the
Earth [22], but at the same time they are specific from
the pelagic marine environment: they are typical

Page 4 of 14

examples of specialists living on a widely extended habitat on the Earth. For these taxa, however, genetic differences that can be associated to niche differentiation
have been reported, showing that specificity could be
found on subspecific (ecotype) level [23]. The gastrointestinal tract of animals is, once more, the environment
where more specific bacteria can be found.
It must also be remarked that for environmental subtypes, the most detailed level of the environmental classification, specificity is almost inexistent at any
taxonomic depth (Figure 1). The relatively low numbers
of specific bacteria, even at the species level, indicate
that, using this environmental classification,

classification. A particular taxa is defined as specific when a given percentage of its observations belong to a single environment. That
percentage is shown in the abscissa axis. Right side: percentage of cosmopolitan taxa for the three levels of environmental classification, in
relation to the number of environments in which the taxa is present.

Tamames et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:85

environment-specific clades of bacteria are not abundant
and therefore clear-cut specialization is not a widely
used strategy in prokaryotes.
We can define a cosmopolitan taxa as having five or
more observations in 90% of the environments (5 of 5
for supertypes, 18 of 20 for types and 41 of 46 for subtypes). While the upper taxonomic ranks can be considered as eurioic (tolerant to highly diverse conditions),
that behaviour does not necessarily hold for their constituents. This trend can indeed be appreciated in Figure 1,
where cosmopolitanism decreases greatly for the genus
level and disappears almost completely for species.
Again, the upper taxonomic levels (phylum, class and
order) show a uniform behaviour, with high levels of
cosmopolitanism (around 70% of the taxa for environmental supertypes, and 30% for subtypes). This trend
starts to change for taxonomic families, but a sharp
decrease is observed for genera and species. This observation is concordant with the parallel increment in specificity, and indicates that environmental selectivity
manifests mainly at genus or species level.
Focusing in families, Figure 2 illustrates their representation in the diverse environments. It is apparent that
most families can be found in many different environments, with only a few presenting a clear-cut specificity.
According to the specificity criterion cited above, just 3
out of the 211 families (1.4%, see Figure 2) will be specific
for environmental types: two Clostridia (Lachnospiraceae
and Oscillospiraceae), and the gamma-proteobacterial
family Succinivibrionaceae, all of them specific for the
gastro-intestinal tract of animals (Additional file 1, Table
S1). These are strictly anaerobic chemoorganotrophs that
are found in the rumen of cattle, sheep and other animals. The distribution of different species within these
families can nevertheless be quite heterogeneous depending on the diet of the animal, according to the available
carbon and energy sources [24]. When using the broader
classification of environmental supertypes with the same
criteria, we found specificity for 13 families (6.1%),
mainly from thermal and host-associated habitats (Figure
2, and Additional file 1, Table S1). No specific families
were found, however, when using the most detailed classification of environmental subtypes. Hence, we can say
that under this criterion, specificity is a rare event in
taxonomic families. If we relax the specificity criterion,
the number of putative specific families increases, but
such criteria are probably too loose and inadequate for
determining specificity.
In contrast, cosmopolitanism seems to be more common
for families, with their members well distributed in most
environments. Two clear examples can be found in Pseudomonadaceae or Flavobacteriaceae. By defining a cosmopolitan family as having five or more observations in
90% of the environments, we found that 111, 23 and 4

Page 5 of 14

families met these criteria for environmental supertypes,
types and subtypes, respectively (Figure 2 and Additional
file 1, Table S1). Therefore, for that taxonomic level,
there is more likelihood of finding instances of cosmopolitanism than of specificity. But this could also simply be
due to the lack of enough specific features within this
taxonomic level, which nevertheless could appear at a
deeper taxonomic resolution. For example, members of
the family Flavobacteriaceae can colonize diverse ecological niches with a wide range of physical-chemical characteristics [25]. It is also possible that our classification is
too broad, even at subtype level, to capture the possible
patterns of environmental specificity.
To exclude possible biases due to unequal size of the
samples, we created subsets comprising just samples of
comparable size. The results of cosmopolitanism and ubiquity for two of these datasets are shown in Additional file
2, Figure S1, showing that the general trends exposed
above are well conserved in these and other subsets.
Cosmopolitanism and specificity patterns can also
be revealed by inspecting the evenness of the distribution
of a particular taxon in the different environments. This
can be done by calculating biodiversity indices. For a particular taxon, high diversity values indicate both presence
in more environments and a well-balanced distribution
across them, as expected for ubiquitous families, while
low diversity indicates preference for some environment
(s). The results (Additional file 3, Table S2) suggest that
the most diverse families with respect to their environmental distribution are Pseudomonadaceae, Comamonadaceae, Caulobacteraceae, Flavobacteriaceae and
Xanthomonadaceae, while amongst the least diverse
families we find Pyrodictiaceae, Aquificaceae and Nautiliaceae (in hydrothermal environments), Thermoactinomycetaceae (soil), Sulfolobaceae (geothermal),
Oscillospiraceae and Lachnospiraceae (gut).
It is apparent, however, that even in the absence of total
specificity, some taxa show a marked preference for some
environments. For instance, some archaeal clades have
been found mostly, but not exclusively, in thermal samples. To quantify these preferences (affinities), we used a
Bayesian hierarchical statistical model for detecting differences between the observed and expected distributions of
abundances of the taxa in the environments, under the
assumption of statistical independence between taxa and
environments. The results are presented in Additional file
4, Figure S2. The highest affinities were found for taxa present in thermal environments (families Aquificaceae, Sulfolobaceae, Thermoproteaceae and Thermococcaceae), or in
association with human tissues (Pasteurellaceae for oral,
Lactobacillaceae for vagina, or Oscillospiraceae for gut).
Here, 180 of the 211 families (85% of the total) show a
high affinity for at least one environmental type, and 52
(25%) do for just one. This does not imply environmental

specificity but does, undoubtedly, indicate a clear environmental preference.
The families that are present in many environments,
but not showing relevant affinity values for any of them,
may be considered ubiquitous. Amongst these we
mainly find Proteobacteria, such as Xanthomonadaceae,
Comamonadaceae, Pseudomonadaceae and Burkholderiaceae, but also the archaeal Methanosarcinaceae and
the Clostridia Peptococcaceae families.
It is interesting to note that the Clostridia clade harbors cosmopolitan families, such as Peptococcaceae, and
environment-specific ones such as Lachnospiraceae or
Oscillospiraceae. This indicates that phylogenetically
close families can show strikingly different environmental preferences and distribution patterns, which at least
for some cases, questions the validity of the proposed
relationship between phylogenetic distance and environmental preferences [26,27].
Taxonomic distributions can be used to explore the
characteristics of the environments themselves. Grouping environments according to similarity in their taxonomic profiles can help us to understand the main
environmental features at play in selecting prokaryotic

diversity. To assess the relationship between environments and taxa, we clustered the different environmental types according to the affinities of their different taxa
(Figure 3).
The environments are separated into five different
groups. The first one is associated with animal tissues
(oral, gut, vagina, other human tissues, samples from
animal tissues and aerial specimens, the last mostly
coming from air expired from human subjects). These
habitats clearly differ from the rest, and some of the
prokaryotes living there do not thrive in other locations
[28]. Thus, host association with animals emerges as the
first discriminating factor in the composition of the prokaryotic assemblages.
The second group to segregate is composed of thermal environments (geo- and hydrothermal), and also
shows a clearly distinct taxonomic profile. Both environments are separated by long distances in the dendrogram, which indicates significant differences between
them. The absence of oxygen and light in hydrothermal
locations accounts for the presence of some anaerobic
methanogenic archaea in hydrothermal, but not geothermal sources, or for some photosynthetic cyanobacterial

affinities and the resulting dendrogram from the cluster analysis of the environment types, using log-affinities and euclidean distance. Purple and
orange cells represent low and high affinity values, respectively.

Tamames et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:85
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/85

families that are located only in geothermal spots where
light is present.
The third group comprises saline environments, and is
represented mainly by heterogeneous marine samples
which show quite similar profiles. Athalassohaline waters
of saline inland lakes (including soda lakes, with a
mineral composition different from marine waters) also
cluster within this group, showing that salinity as a
whole, and not salt composition, is the determinant ecological factor. This is related to osmotic adaptations of
the organisms. The fourth group contains terrestrial samples from soil and plants. Finally, the last group is dominated by freshwater samples. It is very interesting to note
that freshwater samples are more related with terrestrial
samples than with marine ones. This indicates that salinity is a very important selective factor for the composition of prokaryotic communities, and more relevant than
the apparently loose distinction between aquatic and terrestrial media, as was also described by Lozupone and
Knight using a strictly phylogenetic approach [20]. Many
prokaryotic taxa found in soil samples, may actually
thrive in the interstitial water within soil particles [29],
which could explain the highest similarity between the
taxonomic profiles of freshwater and soil environments.
When performing the analysis for environmental subtypes, the trends above are shown again, but new details
emerge (Additional file 5, Figure S3). As before, hostassociated habitats obviously separate from the rest, but
on this occasion the cluster includes the samples related
to food treatments and compost. Thermal environments
form the second clear division. The next groups to separate correspond to nutrient-rich soils (forests, grasslands
and agricultural soils), and to saline environments. Interestingly, the latter are all aquatic except for saline soils,
which cluster with this saline subgroup rather than with
other soil subtypes, thus illustrating the importance of
salinity. The remaining groups are formed by a mixture
of artificial, freshwaters and nutrient-poor soils that do
not separate clearly. The conspicuous distinction
between rich and poor soil types correlates with the
increase of several taxa in rich soils (especially Actinobacteria), and is in accordance with previous studies [30].
To further explore the relationships between environments and taxa, we carried out a Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA), a well-known multivariate
technique traditionally used in ecology to explore patterns of variation in community data matrices. Figure 4
shows the results for family level. The first two resulting
axes allow the discrimination between environments
according to their taxonomic profiles. The first axis
clearly separates animal tissues from other environments.
The second axis discriminates saline and thermal environments from the rest. Freshwaters and soil samples are
nearby and they both are close to the origin, thus

Page 8 of 14

indicating the absence of very specific taxa in them. This
result supports the division in the five main environmental groups found earlier.
A measure of the complexity of the composition of the
different environments can be obtained by means of the
diversity indices calculated from the abundance of taxa in
the samples from these environments. Low diversity values
for a given environment indicate that some taxa are highly
prevalent (appear in most samples from that environment)
and dominate, while high diversity represents less dominance and a more balanced composition. The values of
the Shannon’s index of diversity for the different environments are displayed in Additional file 6, Table S3, and the
histograms showing the distributions can be seen in Additional file 7, Figure S4. Amongst the most diverse environments, we find artificial, freshwaters and soil. The artificial
environments are very heterogeneous and sparse, and
hence a high variability between samples is expected.
Freshwaters and soils environments do not appear to be
very restrictive, as commented above and, therefore many
taxa are present and none dominates clearly. The least
diverse habitats are host-associated, thermal or saline,
indicating that the strong constraints imposed by these
environments (such as anaerobiosis, high temperatures or
high salt content) greatly limit the representation of taxa.
Finally, we are interested in exploring how complete
our knowledge is about the richness of species in the different habitats considered in this study. By using the distribution of sequences and OTUs in the samples of a
given environment, we derived a collector’s curve which
illustrates the rate at which new OTUs are found as
more samples are sequenced. This curve indicates the
present coverage of the environments and the completeness of the current knowledge about the abundance of
OTUs, thus also providing a comparison of the richness
of the different environments. The curves (Figure 5)
show that the highest richness in OTUs can be expected
for soil, freshwater and artificial environments, while saline waters and all thermal and host-associated environments appear as less rich. This is in good agreement with
our previous results. Nevertheless, the pyrosequencing of
individual marine samples have determined that saline
waters are very rich in species [31]. That observation is
not in contradiction with our results, because here we
consider sets of samples, not just individual ones. Individual marine samples can be richer than samples from
other environments, especially if they have been exhaustively sequenced. But it is also likely that other environments can harbour more species than sea waters [32],
which can be related to the variety of different niches.
It is also important to notice that most curves show
no saturation (i.e., they are far from reaching their
respective top plateaus). Therefore, we can conclude
that there is still a long way to obtain a complete

description of species diversity for almost any environment. The only exceptions may be human tissues
(vagina, oral and other tissues) where their respective
curves show a relative saturation, thus indicating that
we have already observed the majority of the putative
species in these habitats. The curve for gut does not
show this clear saturation, and one reason is that it
includes samples from very different animals (not only
humans), thus making it more heterogeneous than the
samples from the rest of human tissues.

Discussion and Conclusions
In short, our results indicate that most taxa can be found
in many different environment types. Environmental specificity is not very common, although clear environmental preferences exist. The most selective environments,
where more specialist taxa can be found, are animal tissues and thermal locations. Salinity also emerges as a
very important factor in shaping prokaryotic diversity.
These results are in accordance to previously described
patterns [20]. The specificity of their characteristic
microbial inhabitants is then better explained by the
adaptations of these microorganisms to the

environmental constraints than by geographic isolation
of these habitats. In contrast, soil and freshwater habitats
are the least restrictive environments as they harbor the
highest number of prokaryotic taxa and species. This is
probably related to the heterogeneity of these environments, in which, besides a relative homogeneity for some
ecological factors, a wide range of physical-chemical and
biotic factors can be found and, therefore, many different
niches are available, thus being suitable to be colonised
by a variety of prokaryotic taxa. For instance, although it
could be though that freshwater habitats are relatively
homogeneous, strong environmental gradients are found
within freshwater bodies (see [33], for multiple examples). In the samples considered in our study, a broad
variety of environmental features are represented for
freshwater habitats, such as for trophic status (from oligotrophic to hypereutrophic), limnological features (e.g
shallow mixed to deep stratified lakes), and others.
Nevertheless, some caveats of this study must be taken
into account. It is necessary to consider whether the patterns of taxa distribution in those environments are
linked to either environmental factors or to historical
events bound to habitat isolation [6]. Many taxa have

been found in particular environments only occasionally,
which could indicate that they might not be active members of the communities thriving in these locations.
Indeed for soil environments, it has been proposed that
many of the species found in a particular location are
inactive [34]. The bacteria capable of sporulating are
clear candidates for such a role, as has also been observed
for microbial eukaryotes in freshwater sediments [2]. For
instance, spore-forming genus Bacillus is the second
most abundant genus in this dataset, only after Pseudomonas. This could be a general case for prokaryotic communities, which may be composed of “core members”
(as indicated by the high similarity found between samples from the same environments, see Additional file 8,
Figure S5), and sporadic members which are limited by
niche specificity and competitive interactions, and which
remain mostly inactive until a change in the media conditions favours their growth. They could also correspond to
transient species, which are accidentally passing,
although a recent metagenomic analysis found a very low
rate of sequences from putative transient species [35].

Page 10 of 14

We found that most OTUs have been observed once
(Additional file 9, Table S4). We have deliberately omitted
these OTUs from the analyses of cosmopolitanism and
specificity, because their low abundance does not allow to
extract conclusions about their environmental distributions. Nevertheless, their inclusion does not affect significantly the conclusions extracted for all taxonomic ranks,
except that of species (Additional file 10, Figure S6).
Further study is required to understand why the majority
of OTUs are rare, and some work has already been done
by Sogin and colleagues to address this point [31]. As
commented above, they could correspond to specialist
species with a very limited niche. But it is also likely that
the limited size of samplings cannot recover low-abundance OTUs from the environments and samples where
they actually exist. After all, it is virtually impossible to
conclusively show that a microbial taxon is absent from a
given location by the current sequencing methods [6].
Also the heterogeneous size of the samples can introduce a bias in the results, because big samples are likely to
recover more species than small ones. Also rare OTUs are
more likely to be detected in larger samples. Information
about the abundance of each taxa in each sample could
provide relevant information to correct this size effect. But
unfortunately, this information is not present in the original source of data. Therefore, the patterns described here
could be affected because samples of different size are
being considered. To exclude this possibility, we created
smaller datasets composed uniquely of samples of comparable size. The results of cosmopolitanism and ubiquity for
two such datasets are shown in Additional file 2, Figure
S1. It can be seen that the patterns are very similar to the
ones obtained with the full dataset. Also in the correspondence analysis we transformed the data dividing frequencies by the number of samples instead, as a proxy for the
number of sequences, thus assuming that larger samples
tend to have more sequences. Finally, in the Bayesian
model of affinities, we included random effects to partially
account for the variation of the unknown number of
sequences.
It is also necessary to consider that most data have been
obtained by the standard sequencing procedures which
involve PCR amplification steps using “universal” primers,
a procedure that is known to be biased [36,37]. Universal
primers are designed according to current knowledge and
could perform poorly or even miss species or taxa that
remain unknown. Another source of potential biases is
that in clone library sampling, often just some few clones
of interest are sequenced or submitted, discarding the rest.
To evaluate community composition, we need new and
more accurate approaches that do not rely on primers or
probes. Nowadays, new sequencing technologies can provide the adequate framework for the unrestricted sequencing of 16S rRNA gene sequences or of other universally

Tamames et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:85
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/85

conserved genes [36] that can be used to accurately
describe prokaryotic diversity. It is expected that the samples analysed in this way can describe better the real diversity and to unveil the presence of specialist species.
An interesting point that has not been addressed in
our study is the consideration of the temporal dimension. Indeed, some of the samples have been taken in
the same spots, in different sampling experiments performed at different times. A good example are the samples collected in lakes: in our dataset, there are six
samples taken in Mono Lake (United States), five in
Lake Cadagno (Switzerland), and four in Lake Kinneret
(Israel), which differ among sampling times. Therefore,
it would be possible to address the temporal variation of
the microbial composition in these sites. But it is very
difficult to discriminate between temporal and spatial
factors. In this particular case, all these lakes display different types of vertical stratification, and the microbial
communities found at different depths could vary and
be influenced by the mixing regime. A temporal analysis
should therefore be performed with sets of samples
where all environmental features have been well characterized. And also, as above, the heterogeneous sizes of
the samples and the existence of different niches can be
misleading and complicate the analysis.
As far as we know, this is the most comprehensive
assessment of the distribution and diversity of prokaryotic taxa and their associations with different environments. We expect that this and further studies can help
to gain a better understanding of the complex factors
influencing the structure of the prokaryotic communities.

Methods
Obtaining sequences and grouping in samples

We collected 16S rRNA gene sequences from the environmental section of GenBank database, comprising the
results of many different 16S rRNA sampling experiments. After discarding short (less than 250 bps) and
long (more than 1900 bps) entries, we have obtained a
data set of 399.098 16S sequences of variable length
from bacterial and archaeal species. Each sampling
experiment is identified by its reference (title of the
study and authors), and the individual sequences are
assigned to their original sample. A total of 4.334 samples were identified, that reduced to 3.502 when we
eliminated those with less than five sequences. It is
important to notice that the original source can describe
each sample exhaustively, listing each sequence found,
or rather enumerate just the different genotypes by
removing the identical sequences. The second case is
the most common one, in which no information about
the abundance of individual genotypes is present. In
these instances, we can obtain information about the
richness (number of genotypes) of each individual

Page 11 of 14

sample, but not about its diversity (abundance of each
genotype). For normalizing the minority of cases in
which some of this information is present, identical
sequences were eliminated by using cd-hit [38] with
identity parameter set to 100%, producing a final data
set containing 359.928 sequences.
Classifying samples in environmental categories and
environmental features

We have derived a classification of environments to
categorize the collection of samples. The environments
are classified in 5 supertypes, 20 types and 46 subtypes,
as can be seen in the schema shown in Table 1.
We have used a semi-automatical text-mining procedure for classifying the samples in these environmental
categories [39]. The performance of the classifier is fairly
good, producing results for 52% of the samples with a
precision of 81%. The results were checked by human
experts, correcting the possible mistakes and increasing
the coverage by annotating unclassified instances. By
this procedure, 3.181 samples (91% of all samples) were
classified (Table 1).
In some instances, a single sample is composed by different individual sampling experiments, which have been
merged for submission to the database. Usually this is
not an obstacle for classification and for the final objective of describing taxonomic diversity of the different
environments, because all individual samples come from
the same or very similar environments (different rivers,
different guts of termites, different water treatment
plants, etc). In the few instances (43 samples, around 1%
of the total) in which the individual samples come from
diverse environments (for example, a river, its estuary,
and the adjacent ocean), they have been classified in all
of these environments, thus reflecting the multiple origins of the sequences. The results were unaltered when
we repeated the analyses excluding these 43 samples.
Identifying OTUs

We have grouped closely related sequences into OTUs
using cd-hit [38], clustering sequences at 97% identity,
which is often proposed as a reference level that may
separate different prokaryotic species [17]. This resulted
in 124.390 different clusters, which were considered as
OTUs. 67% of these OTUs are composed by a single
sequence (Additional file 9, Table S4), and were excluded
for the study of specificity and cosmopolitanism.
Taxonomic assignment of sequences and OTUs

Each of the sequences was assigned to a reference taxon
by using RDP classifier [40], considering only the assignments with more than 80% confidence. This resulted in
predictions for 356.250 sequences, corresponding to different taxonomic ranks. Additionally, we also used an

Tamames et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:85
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/85

assignment procedure based on Blastn searches against
Greengenes database http://greengenes.lbl.gov, collecting
the bit-scores for the five best hits belonging to each
taxa, and finding the taxa with the best average score
and a fixed difference to the second best. This procedure assigns 90% of the sequences to phyla, 81% to
classes, 72% to orders, 65% to families and 47% to genera. At family level, 85% of the assignments are coincident between both approaches.
OTUs were classified by extracting a consensus from
the taxonomic assignments of their individual
sequences. The objective was to find the taxon that
dominates at the lowest possible taxonomic rank, fulfilling the following criteria: having more than five
sequences in the OTU, and being the only taxon with at
least 25% of the sequences of the OTU assigned to it.
The usage of either RDP or Greengenes assignments
produced coincident assignments for 91% of the
instances, and does not alter the results significantly.
Unless stated otherwise, the results shown correspond
to RDP assignments.
Collector’s curves

To create collector’s curves for the distribution of OTUs
in environments, a single metasample was created for each
environment, pooling together all the sequences from the
samples corresponding to it. We simulated the sampling
of the metasample by picking up individual sequences randomly, with non-replacement. To produce the curve, we
checked whether another sequence for the corresponding
OTU had already been seen or not. The simulated sampling continued until no sequences were left. The full procedure was repeated ten times, and the individual curves
were averaged to obtain a final result.
Statistical analyses

We computed a two-way table with the number of different OTUs per taxa and environment. To assess the
level of bacterial biodiversity of the different environment types and the degree of ubiquity of the taxa considered, we computed Hill biodiversity numbers [41]
using this abundance community matrix for both taxa
and environments, respectively. We considered Hill
numbers for the scale values 0, 1 and 2 which, for a
given environment, for example, correspond to the total
number of families, the exponential of the Shannon
index of biodiversity, and the inverse Simpson index.
Exploratory data analyses revealed that those environments with more samples tended to have more OTUs.
To remove this ‘size’ effect, we transformed the data by
dividing the frequencies in each column by the number
of samples in that environment, thus creating a community matrix which contained the average number of
OTUs per sample for each taxa and environment type.

Page 12 of 14

We then carried out a Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) to explore the variation in the transformed
abundance matrix.
We also fitted a Bayesian hierarchical model to the original community matrix in order to quantify the affinity
between taxa and environments. In the first layer, our
model assumes a Poisson distribution for the number of
OTUs Yij observed in the taxonomic family i and environment type j. The mean of this distribution is assumed
to be lij Eij, where E ij is the expected number of OTUs
under the hypothesis of independence between the distributions of taxa and environments, and lij is the underor over-presence of family i in environment j. The values
of lij > 1 indicate the affinity of the family for the environment, whereas the values of lij < 1 suggest a lack of
affinity. In the second layer, the ‘affinities’ lij (on the log
scale) are decomposed into the taxa and environment
main effects plus an interaction: log lij = a + θi + gj + νij.
The main effects of taxa and environments can be interpreted as surrogates for the unobserved variables that
associate to each one. The interaction terms (or residuals) can be seen as an adjusted affinity, that is, the part
of the over- or under-presence that cannot be accounted
for by the factors linked to the taxa or environment.
Statistical inference was performed under the Bayesian
paradigm, which implies assigning prior distributions to
the parameters. We chose normal distributions for each
of the main effects and a mixture of two normal distributions for the interactions. One of the components of
the mixture is intended to pick up noise, whereas the
other aims to pick up true departures from the main
effects. We implemented the model in JAGS http://
mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net, a free-license software for
Bayesian inference. The outputs from this analysis were
samples from the posterior distribution of the model
parameters. We then represented the posterior median
of the affinities between taxa and environments using a
heatmap; we chose a dichromatic scale from purples to
oranges. The former represent low affinity values (meaning an underpresence of the taxa in the environment),
whereas the latter represent affinity (overpresence). We
used standard hierarchical clustering with Euclidean distance to group the environment types according to the
values of their taxa affinities (on the log scale). The
resulting cluster dendrogram is displayed next to the
heatmap to make visualization and the interpretation of
the results easier.
Database creation

We have created envDB, a mySQL database containing
all the data associated with this work. The user can perform queries on sequences, OTUs, samples and environments under a flexible and user-friendly interface. The
database will be updated regularly and its capabilities

It can be seen that the trends are not very different to these shown in

OTUs are considered environment-specific by definition, specificity
percentage increases very much for species, and cosmopolitanism
decreases in the same way.
