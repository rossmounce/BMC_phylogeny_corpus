Islands beneath islands: phylogeography of
a groundwater amphipod crustacean in the
Balearic archipelago

Abstract
Background: Metacrangonyctidae (Amphipoda, Crustacea) is an enigmatic continental subterranean water family
of marine origin (thalassoid). One of the species in the genus, Metacrangonyx longipes, is endemic to the Balearic
islands of Mallorca and Menorca (W Mediterranean). It has been suggested that the origin and distribution of
thalassoid crustaceans could be explained by one of two alternative hypotheses: (1) active colonization of inland
freshwater aquifers by a marine ancestor, followed by an adaptative shift; or (2) passive colonization by stranding
of ancestral marine populations in coastal aquifers during marine regressions. A comparison of phylogenies,
phylogeographic patterns and age estimations of clades should discriminate in favour of one of these two
proposals.
Results: Phylogenetic relationships within M. longipes based on three mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and one
nuclear marker revealed five genetically divergent and geographically structured clades. Analyses of cytochrome
oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) mtDNA data showed the occurrence of a high geographic population subdivision in both
islands, with current gene flow occurring exclusively between sites located in close proximity. Molecular-clock
estimations dated the origin of M. longipes previous to about 6 Ma, whereas major cladogenetic events within the
species took place between 4.2 and 2.0 Ma.
Conclusions: M. longipes displayed a surprisingly old and highly fragmented population structure, with major
episodes of cladogenesis within the species roughly correlating with some of the major marine transgressionregression episodes that affected the region during the last 6 Ma. Eustatic changes (vicariant events) -not active
range expansion of marine littoral ancestors colonizing desalinated habitats-explain the phylogeographic pattern
observed in M. longipes.

Background
Subterranean fauna provides unique opportunities for
the study of evolutionary mechanisms and speciation
processes [1]. In recent years, phylogeographic analyses
have revealed unprecedented cases of cryptic speciation,
restricted distribution and presumed sympatric speciation among different cave-dwelling animal groups [2].
Nevertheless, the occurrence of extensive morphological
conservatism in subterranean fauna frequently hampers
the establishment of phylogenetic inferences based solely
on morphological features. In this context, homoplasy

arises from common exposure to the particular selective
pressures inherent to cave life (i.e., darkness and oligotrophy) or from the lack of directional selection [3,4].
Conversely, isolation in caves can lead these morphologically undifferentiated subterranean organisms to display high levels of genetic divergence [4-6].
Geological and hydrological processes, in particular
shifts in water tables, can lead to the isolation or connection of aquifers, with consequent effects on gene
flow between populations of subterranean aquatic
organisms [6]. In the same way, marine regressions are
suggested to have played a major role in the isolation of
many marine relicts in continental groundwaters [7-10].
Recent molecular phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies on subterranean amphipods emphasize the role

played by historical factors (i.e., glacial or drought episodes) in the pattern of genetic diversification and distribution displayed by these animals [5,6,11]. Likewise, [12]
considered the influence of contingency, i.e., whether
the colonization event involved a single localized surface
ancestor or multiple, geographically separated ancestors,
on the shaping of these patterns. In addition, larval life
history traits, such as feeding mode (planktotrophic vs.
lecithotrophic) can play a determinant role in crustacean
distribution, as they control the duration of the dispersive phase [13,14]. However, stygobiont amphipods have
a comparatively reduced dispersal potential (as do all
peracarid crustaceans), as the females carry offspring in
a marsupium and these are brooded and not released
into the water column until metamorphosed into
diminutive non-natatory adults [15].
Among the obligate dwellers of subterranean waters
(stygobionts), a high number belong to so-called thalassoid lineages, organisms that are derived directly from
marine ancestors [7]. Thalassoid forms are known to
occur among a vast array of faunistic groups, especially
the Crustacea [16,8]. The ancestors of thalassoid animals
presumably inhabited marine transitional habitats, such
as submarine fissures, mixohaline submarine karstic
springs or the interstitial medium developed in sandy
and gravelly coastal sediments, where sharp variations in
salinity (i.e., periodical exposure to desalinated waters)
and other environmental conditions mimic, in some
way, those found in fresh groundwaters [7]. Colonization of inland freshwater aquifers by this preadapted
marine fauna might have proceeded as a natural extension of their primary niche, followed by an adaptive
shift; this process would be independent of the occurrence of environmental constraints, such as episodes of
glaciation, drought or marine regression [17,18]. This
hypothesis provides a plausible explanation for the origin of some freshwater stygobiont ostracods closely
related to marine euryhaline taxa [19]. However, most
faunistic and biogeographic evidence favours an alternative vicariant scenario by which colonization occurs passively via stranding of ancestral populations during
episodes of marine regression [7-10]. Accordingly, sea
withdrawal or tectonic uplift at different geological periods could have led to the gradual isolation of populations of ancestral marine taxa in inland groundwaters,
triggering their ulterior diversification and speciation.
This hypothesis explains satisfactorily the distribution of
many stygobiont crustaceans and is testable by collating
a phylogenetic framework and molecular-clock-age estimates of relevant clades, with their respective geographic distributions [2,20].
Here, we studied the phylogeography of Metacrangonyx longipes Chevreux, 1909, a euryhaline stygobiont
amphipod crustacean that is endemic to Mallorca and

Page 2 of 11

Menorca (Balearic Islands; W Mediterranean). On Mallorca, it occurs in various types of groundwater habitats,
from coastal anchialine caves (sensu [21]) of raised salinity to freshwater inland wells, caves and springs. On
Menorca, the species is restricted to coastal anchialine
caves and wells and is absent from fresh inland groundwaters. On both islands, the species is limited to lowlands and is absent in apparently suitable habitats
located at elevations higher than 125 m above sea level.
The Metacrangonyctidae is a strictly inland water subterranean family with no close relatives; however, several
lines of evidence strongly suggest its marine origin: (1)
its members are known only from continental regions
that were covered by ancient epicontinental seas [22,23];
and (2) several species still maintain ties with the marine
environment (i.e., they live in anchialine wells and caves
in coastal areas; [23]).
In this study, we used the sequences of three mitochondrial and one nuclear gene of M. longipes and of
several congeneric species to perform a phylogenetic
analysis of the species and infer population divergence
times. Moreover, we use sequences of the cytochrome
oxidase subunit 1 gene from a more comprehensive data
set to perform a phylogeographic analysis and to examine the population structure of this taxon. Given the
manifested euryhalinity of M. longipes and the absence
of any appreciable morphological differentiation between
its populations on the two islands, our initial prediction
was that the species could have dispersed across the
groundwater environment of the islands using the virtually continuous peripheral coastal anchialine pathway,
from which it could have colonized inland freshwater
habitats recurrently. If this was the case, we could
expect a pattern of considerable gene flow and shallow
genetic divergences within each island, with genetic signatures of inland populations deriving from coastal
ones. However, our study revealed that this amphipod
displays a remarkably ancient and highly fragmented
population structure, with episodes of cladogenesis that
could be related to major sea-level changes that affected
the islands during the last 6 Ma.

Results
Four gene fragments-three mitochondrial (cytochrome
oxidase subunit 1 (cox1), cytochrome b (cob) and 16S
rRNA (rrnL)) and one nuclear (Histone H3A)-with a
total sequence length of about 1.7 Kb were sequenced
from 34 Metacrangonyx longipes specimens and the outgroups Metacrangonyx ilvanus, M. remyi and M. sp
(details on sampling localities appear in Additional file
1, Figure 1 and in the Methods section). These mitochondrial sequences were assumed not to correspond to
nuclear pseudogenes, as the mtDNA protein-coding
genes considered did not include stop codons or

frameshift mutations and no double peaks appeared in
the corresponding chromatograms. Moreover, the separate analyses of each marker gave essentially congruent
tree topologies, with Partition Bremer Support (PBS)
positive values for most of the tree nodes (not shown).
Few nodes with low support showed PBS values close to
zero, suggesting that their low phylogenetic signal is not
due to incongruence among markers. Most of the variation is contained in the mitochondrial genes: cox1, cob
and rrnL had 120, 78 and 43 parsimony informative
positions, respectively. Histone H3A sequences rendered
five haplotypes only, with six parsimony informative

sites and two fixed substitutions in M. longipes with
respect to the outgroup species.
Phylogenetic analyses and genetic distances

Bayesian and maximum likelihood (ML) analyses of the
combined mitochondrial and nuclear data set yielded a
similar topology, in which five divergent monophyletic
lineages of M. longipes not showing geographical overlap
were clearly recognized (see Figure 1 for a map of Mallorca and Menorca and the corresponding sampling
sites, and Figure 2 for the Bayesian tree). A clade comprising three anchialine caves from the S and SE of

(second number).

Mallorca (clade A; localities 4, 5 and 7) was highly supported and recovered as sister to the remaining clades
after rooting the tree with congeneric species. The
remaining populations formed four highly supported
clades, although the evolutionary relationships among
them remain unresolved: clade D (Menorcan, corresponding to anchialine caves 20 and 21); two divergent
Mallorcan clades, one located on the west side (clade C,
corresponding to freshwater cave 9) and the other on
the north side of the island (clade E; localities 2, 3, 6,
16, 25 and 26, corresponding to both anchialine caves
and freshwater wells); and clade B, comprising wells
located far inland in the Mallorcan central area. The latter cluster was, in turn, subdivided into two genetic
groups (clade B1: localities 1, 8, 22, 24, 31; and clade
B2: localities 10, 17, 18, 19 and 28) showing an approximate NE-SW geographical segregation. A more comprehensive data set comprising the cox1 gene fragment
from 162 specimens was used in population analyses
(Table 1). Bayesian and ML analyses performed on the
cox1 data set resulted in phylogenetic trees that were
compatible with those derived from the combined analyses mentioned above; however, ambiguous or non-supported relationships persisted among clades, such as the
position of the Menorcan populations with respect to
their Mallorcan counterparts. In addition, the relationship among Mallorcan clades E and C was only weakly
supported (Additional file 2). Parsimonious reconstructions of habitat type based on the cox1 or the total evidence mtDNA phylogenetic analysis showed at least
three transitions to fresh inland groundwaters from
anchialine brackish habitats (see Additional file 3).

Cox1 uncorrected distances between collection sites
ranged from a minimum of 0.5% between those located
close to each other (viz., 18 and 28, only 3.5 km apart)
to a maximum of 8.9% (corrected to 9.8% using a GTR
model) between populations from the two islands (viz.,
localities 4 and 20, separated by 68 km) or between
some Mallorcan populations. As deduced from the phylogenetic analyses, clade A was the most divergent (7.88% mean uncorrected genetic distance with respect to
the remaining clades), whereas the distance between the
other clades fell between 6.3-7.5%. The distance between
subclades B1 and B2 averaged 5.5%.
Population genetic structure and genetic diversity

Fifty different cox1 haplotypes were identified in the
sampled specimens from the 31 populations analysed
(EMBL accession numbers FR729731-FR729892) (Table
1). Four haplotypes were shared between neighbouring
populations: haplotypes H27 and H29 in several central
Mallorcan localities (Montuïri/Ruberts; stations 10, 14
and 19), whereas haplotypes H19 and H22 were present
in two Sineu wells (stations 22 and 23). Table 1 summarizes the standard intra-population diversity estimated for cox1. Six populations included only one
haplotype (h = 0), although in three of them only two
specimens (the only ones collected) were analysed. In
sharp contrast, three populations showed maximum
diversity indices, as every individual bore a different
haplotype (h = 1). The rest of populations attained lowto-moderate h values, in the range of 0.25-0.86. Diversity was much lower in the two Menorcan populations
(three haplotypes per 28 individuals) compared with the

deviations.

Mallorcan populations (47 haplotypes per 144 individuals). Nucleotide diversity (mean number of pair-wise
differences π) were low at most locations (π < 0.5%);
population 28 alone exhibited a π value > 1% because of
the presence of an individual bearing a divergent haplotype. Neutrality tests were non-significant in all cases,
with the exception of populations 7 (Fu’s Fs = -0.182, P
< 0.05) and 8 (Ramos-Onsins and Rozas R 2 = 0.51, P
<0.01).
The Mantel test revealed a moderately significant correlation (r = 0.467, P < 0.001) between genetic and geographic distances. In addition, cox1 pair-wise population
F ST values were generally high (F ST = 0.5-0.99) and
highly significant, with the exception of between neighbouring populations (viz., 19 vs. 10-15, 24 vs. 28).
Accordingly, SAMOVA showed that the optimum number of population groups necessary to maximize F CT

values was K = 19-20 (FCT = 0.961-0.963), whereas the
corresponding FSC values were the lowest in the K series
tested, as expected [24]. This structure grouped wells
10-15 and 19 into a single population, whereas wells at
Campanet (6) and Pollença (16) on one side, and wells
at Vilafranca (28-31) and Cala Sant Vicenç (26, 27) on
the other, formed three different populations. Most sites
harbouring the same population were less than 2 km
apart, with the exception of sites 10 and 19, which were
separated by about 10 km. The remaining sites each
represented a single, distinct population group, suggesting the occurrence of a high population subdivision with
gene flow occurring exclusively among wells located less
than 10 km apart. The occurrence of an alternative geographical structuring that yielded higher K values was
explored using AMOVA, as this method allows recognition of population groups with any number of K. This

Bauzà-Ribot et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:221
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/221

analysis yielded a similar geographical setting, but identified wells 16, 19 and 26 as different populations;
AMOVA showed that FCT values reached a plateau at
0.96 at K = 19-27, with the highest value attained at K =
23.
Estimation of coalescence time

The coalescence of the mitochondrial sequences of M.
longipes was estimated via Bayesian analyses using the
cox1 population data set and implementing a relaxed
molecular clock with a substitution rate fixed at 0.0115
per year per lineage [25], or the range 0.007-0.013 estimated elsewhere for crustaceans [26]. Tree root ages fell
between 5.4 and 6.2 Ma depending on the assumed rate,
while other node ages were remarkably similar in both
instances, although the crustacean mitochondrial rate
range rendered slightly older estimates and broader confidence intervals (Table 2 and Figure 3). Estimations
using the Yule model on the combined mitochondrial
data set and a standard 2.3% rate fell also in the same
range (Table 2). Based on the coalescent model, divergence of the Mallorcan clade B -comprising localities
from the central area of the island- can be traced back
at 2.3-2.7 Ma, whereas that of clade E - occupying the
N and NE of the island- seems to have occurred at 2.02.4 Ma. In both cases, 95% highest posterior densities
(HPDs) fell within the range 3.7-1.2 Ma (Figure 3 and
Table 2). Seemingly, the node corresponding to clade D
(Menorca) was dated at 2.1-2.3 Ma, whereas that of
clade A (comprising S and SE Mallorcan sites) was
dated at 1.4-1.6 Ma (95% HPD, 3.5-0.6 Ma in both
cases). Nodes corresponding to the two Mallorcan sister
subclades B1 and B2 were dated at 1.1-1.2 and 1.0-1.3
Ma, respectively (95% HPD, 1.8-0.6 Ma). In contrast, the

Discussion
The thalassoid condition of Metacrangonyx longipes is
supported in our study as we can deduce at least three
independent episodes of colonization of fresh inland
groundwaters from primary anchialine, brackish water
ancestors. M. longipes populations appeared split into
five deep genetic lineages devoid of any relevant morphological differentiation. Gene flow between populations did not exceed 10 km and was frequently limited
to occur in a radius of less than 2 km. Therefore, our
results do not support an active colonization of fresh
inland groundwater habitats by expansive crevicular/
interstitial marine littoral ancestors (although past episodes of dispersal during favourable conditions can not
be ruled out completely) [17-19]. If that was the case,
we should have found evidence of substantial connectivity between the populations of M. longipes established
far inland in completely fresh waters and those of the
coastal anchialine medium, and among anchialine population themselves.
Some of the M. longipes clades were linked to particular or neighbouring hydrographic catchments and were
found nowhere else (Figure 4). Thus, clade C was found
exclusively at the Torrent de Sóller catchment, whereas
clade B2 was restricted to the head-waters of Torrent de
Muro (localities 10-15 and 19) and to some vicine stations at the Torrent de Na Borges catchment (localities
17-18 and 28). Likewise, clade B1 (localities 1, 8, 22-24
and 28-31) was found only at the head-waters of three
different catchments: Torrent de Na Borges, Son Bauló
and Son Real (Figure 4); nevertheless, these three torrents became recurrently confluent and formed a single
palaeodrainage system in past glacial periods with lower
sea-level, when the shallow shelf between Mallorca and
Menorca was completely exposed sub-aerially (see
below). These results suggest that quartering within and
displacement along the hyporheic medium associated
with these water-courses played a role in structuring the
populations of the species. Even limited dispersal across
the watershed of adjacent catchments seems possible, as
shown above: the plains where the watershed between
Torrent de Muro and Torrent de Na Borges is located
harbours small, shallow perched aquifers that probably
form a continuum in winter, when the area is soaked
and attracts important numbers of waders and other
waterbirds (D. J., personal observation).
In a study on hyalid and crangonyctoid stygobiont
amphipods from W Australian calcrete aquifers, Cooper
et al. [5] showed that the major mitochondrial cox1
lineages were restricted to a single isolated calcrete,

calcretes placed in the same palaeodrainage channel are
genetically similar (suggesting the occurrence of gene
flow in the past), populations do not appear necessarily
clustered according to palaeodrainage channel. This pattern could result from the occurrence of gene flow or
range expansion between palaeodrainages in the past,
before populations became isolated in particular calcretes. The ulterior isolation of populations could be
associated with a major period of aridification that
affected the region between 10 and 4 Ma [5].
Major cladogenetic events in M. longipes can be
related to the succession of past sea-level changes in the
Mediterranean (with the caveat of the limitations and
errors associated with molecular-clock estimations).
During the Tortonian (11.3 Ma), Mallorca and Menorca
were invaded by an epicontinental sea that reduced the
former to a cluster of small islands roughly corresponding to its current uplands, whereas the southern half of
Menorca was probably completely submerged (see Figure 1) [27]. We assume that a single M. longipes population was then distributed along the entire continental
shelf of the archipelago. This ancestral population overcame the phase of deposition of evaporites of the socalled “Messinian Salinity Crisis”, which was dated precisely at 5.96-5.59 Ma [28] and was coeval with a generalized marine regression episode that could have dried
up the Mediterranean completely at that epoch. This
mega-regression was probably the ultimate cause of the

split of the species into two major lineages: the former
clade A, corresponding to the population that remained
associated and followed the receded sea coastline
towards the SE; and the remaining clades, which were
presumably derived from the portion of the population
that followed the receded coastline towards the N (see
Figure 1). The age of the most recent common ancestor
of clade A and its sister group (the remaining populations) has been estimated in our analyses at ca. 5.4-6.2
Ma using a relaxed molecular clock based on cox1
sequences and a coalescent model.
Sometime between 4.2 and 2.7 Ma (upper-middle
Pliocene; Figure 3), the populations from Menorca
(node D), the Mallorcan central zone (node B), N Mallorca (node E) and W Mallorca (node C) became separated. The corresponding cladogenetic events might be
linked to a single major marine transgression-regression
cycle, such as that triggered by the upper Pliocene refulfilment of the depressed basins in the W Mediterranean
area. The upper Pliocene transgression, which took
place immediately after the Salinity Crisis, probably
reached ca. +100 m above the current sea level in the
Balearic area [29]. This might have enabled the species
to reach the current central zone of Mallorca (Figure 1).
More recently, our phylogeny shows that at the beginning of the late Pliocene, clades B, D and E experienced
further splits that were followed by a differentiation of
populations, with major secondary bifurcations occurring between 2.0 and 0.5 Ma. The uncertainties and
large stochastic errors associated with the molecular

catchments and distribution of major clades recognized based on mtDNA phylogenetic information. The map of Menorcan hydrographic

clock estimations preclude the correlation of the tree
node ages with the datings of particular geological and
climate transitional episodes. However, it is remarkable
that the obtained tree topology is in agreement with the
documented chronological succession of changes in the
late Pliocene to mid-Pleistocene sea-level record in the
North Hemisphere [30-32]. We suggest that recent cladogenetic events in M. longipes can be linked to two
major cooling events roughly dated back at 2.5 to 3 and
1.2 to 0.85 Ma, respectively.

Conclusions
Our data suggest that marine transgression-regression
cycles (eustatic changes) may have induced the repeated
range expansion, contraction and fragmentation of
populations of M. longipes, which appears currently split
into several isolated and genetically divergent lineages
adapted to a broad spectrum of salinity conditions. This
scenario could explain the difficulty in resolving the
phylogenetic relationships among different lineages of

this amphipod, regardless of the method or sequence
data set used: the rapid isolation and almost synchronous
diversification of peripheral populations of the same
ancestor in inland aquifers may have led to this situation.
This hypothesis has been proposed to account for the
distribution of particular anchialine and fresh groundwater taxa at various taxonomic levels and at larger geographical scales [33]. Our study stressed the importance
of changes in sea level as a cause of deep intra-specific
genetic divergence in thalassoid subterranean amphipods,
a pattern that was apparently not accompanied by
remarkable morphological differentiation [32].

Methods
Sampling

One hundred and sixty-two specimens of M. longipes
were collected from seven anchialine and one freshwater
cave, and from 23 freshwater wells spanning the entire
geographic range of the species (Figure 2), using a modified Cvetkov net [34] and hand-held plankton nets.

Bauzà-Ribot et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:221
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/221

Individuals were preserved in 95% ethanol in the field
and conserved at -20°C for subsequent molecular analyses. The sampling locations (with their geographical
coordinates) and the number of individuals analysed for
three mitochondrial and one nuclear marker are
reported in Additional file 1. Three congeneric species
were used as out-groups: the Moroccan Metacrangonyx
sp. and M. remyi Balazuc & Ruffo, 1953 were collected
in a well at Tamri (the coast of Agadir) and at the type
locality located 1280 m above sea-level in the High
Atlas, respectively. M. ilvanus Stoch, 1997 was collected
in a well at Elba Island (Italy).
Sequencing

Genomic DNA was isolated from whole specimens using
the DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. PCR was
used to amplify a fragment of ~650 bp of the mitochondrial cox1 gene using the primers described in [35] or, in
some cases, using the specific primers metacoxF2 (5’GAACTTAGATACCCWGGTAATTTGATYGG-3’) and
metacoxR2 (5’- TCAGTTAATAAYATAGTAATAGCYCC-3’). Fragments of three other genes were also
amplified in a subset of 34 individuals: 400 bp of the 16S
rRNA (rrnL) gene were amplified using the specific primers 16SmetaF (5’- RGTATTTTGACCGTGCTAAGG-3’)
and 16SmetaR (5’- TGTAAAAATTAAARGTTGAACAAAC-3’), 360 bp of the cytochrome b (cob) gene were
amplified using the primers described in [36], and 325 bp
of the nuclear gene Histone H3A were amplified using the
primers from [37]. EMBL accession numbers for the M.
longipes individuals and outgroup species for rrnL, cob
and Histone H3A are FR846024-FR846060, FR846061FR846096 and FR846097-FR846133, respectively.
PCR was performed on a PTC-100 thermocycler (MJ
Research) using a reaction volume of 25 μl and amplification conditions consisted of one cycle at 94°C for 2
min and 40 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 47-55°C for 30 s and
72°C for 1 min, followed by a final incubation step at
72°C for 10 min. Amplified products were purified with
Invitek columns (Invitek GMBH, Berlin, Germany),
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The fragments were sequenced in both directions using the ABI
Prism BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready
Reaction kit v. 2.0 and electrophoresed and detected on
an ABI 3100 automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA). Alignments were performed
using MAFFT http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/mafft/index.
html, with default parameters.
Phylogenetic analyses

Partition Bremer Support values were estimated using
TreeRot v. 3 [38] and PAUP 4.0b10 [39]. Phylogenetic
Bayesian analyses were conducted using MrBayes v.

3.1.2 [40]. We selected the model that fit the data best
for each partition in the jModelTest [41] using the Bayesian information criterion. Models were tested for each
of the three codon positions. The HKY+I model was
selected for the first and second positions, and the GTR
+G model for the third position in the case of the mitochondrial-protein-coding genes, whereas the HKY+I and
F81+I models were used for rrnL and Histone H3A,
respectively. Competing partition strategies were compared using Bayesian Information Criterion [42]. In the
combined mitochondrial and nuclear data set, four partitions were favoured (first + second codon positions of
cox1 and cob, third codon positions of cox1 and cob, rrnL
and Histone H3A as separate partitions), whereas two partitions were selected in the case of cox1-only data sets
(first + second vs third codon positions). Two independent
runs were performed for each Bayesian search with default
prior values, random trees and three heated and one cold
Markov chains running for five million generations and
sampled at intervals of 1000 generations. All parameters
were unlinked and rates were allowed to vary freely over
partitions. The burn-in and convergence of runs were
assessed by examining the plot of generations against likelihood scores using the sump command in MrBayes. The
convergence of all parameters in the two independent
runs was also assessed using the Tracer program, v. 1.4
[43]. Trees resulting from the two independent runs (once
burn-in samples were discarded) were combined in a single majority consensus topology using the sumt command
in MrBayes, and the frequencies of the nodes in a majority
rule tree were taken as a posteriori probabilities [40]. Maximum likelihood analyses using the above-mentioned partition schemes were performed using RAxML v. 7.0.4
implementing a fast bootstrapping algorithm [44]. Finally,
we used Mesquite v. 2.74 [45] to reconstruct the M. longipes habitat character state at ancestral nodes (inland fresh
vs. brackish groundwaters) using parsimony. In this analysis, we used the cox1 phylogenetic tree (as it represents a
full population sampling) and the observed habitat distribution among populations to minimize the number of
steps of habitat change.
Population analyses

A Mantel test was performed on genetic (cox1) and geographic distances of populations using the ZT program
[46], to check for the occurrence of isolation by distance. Population diversity indices for the cox1 data set,
such as number of haplotypes, haplotype and nucleotide
diversity, and pair-wise FST distances and their significance based on 10,000 permutations were obtained
using ARLEQUIN v. 3.01 [47] Populations represented
by only one sequenced individual were excluded from
the analyses. SAMOVA v. 1.0 [24] was used to identify
geographical groupings that maximized genetic variance

Bauzà-Ribot et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:221
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/221

between groups of populations (FSC). The method calculates F statistics (FSC, FST and FCT) using AMOVA [48]
and identifies the optimum number of population
groups for a set of sampled populations given a geographic distribution. We used 100 simulated annealing
processes for each value of K from K = 2 to K = 20.
Neutrality tests were performed for individual populations calculating Fu’s FS [49] and the parameter R2 [50]
using ARLEQUIN v. 3.01 and DnaSP v. 5.10.1 [51],
respectively, with the latter assuming no recombination
and 10,000 replicates. Simulations have shown that R2
and FS are better at detecting population growth compared with other tests, the former being superior for
small sample sizes [50].
Estimation of divergence time

Two different strategies were explored to estimate population divergence times. First we enforced the standard
mitochondrial arthropod rate fixed at 2.3% pair-wise divergence per million years (0.0115 substitutions per year and
lineage [25], and secondly we implemented a mitochondrial rate range of 1.4 to 2.6% substitutions per million
years, that was previously estimated for marine decapods
and has been frequently applied to other crustaceans
[6,26,52]. In both approaches, the cox1 data set of the 162
sampled individuals was used applying an uncorrelated
log-normal clock, assuming a coalescent model with constant population size as the best model fitting the data.
BEAST [53] analyses were run starting from a random
tree and using the models and partitions described for the
MrBayes analyses. The remaining parameters (nucleotide
frequencies and substitution model across partitions) and
the rate-heterogeneity models were unlinked and estimated from the data. The search was set to 20 million
generations, sampling every 1000 generations. The prior
for the crustacean mitochondrial range in clock rate was
implemented as a normal distribution with a mean of 0.01
substitutions per year per lineage, with maximum and
minimum values of 0.013 and 0.007, respectively. The outputs of two independent runs were analysed using Tracer
v. 1.4 after discarding the first 2 million generations. In
another analysis, a reduced data set comprising the three
combined mitochondrial genes from 34 individuals representing the major lineages was used and applied the fixed
standard arthropod mitochondrial clock mentioned above
but assuming a Yule model.
