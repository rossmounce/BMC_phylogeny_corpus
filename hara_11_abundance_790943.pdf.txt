Abundance of Ultramicro Inversions within Local
Alignments between Human and Chimpanzee
Genomes
Yuichiro Hara and Tadashi Imanishi*

Abstract
Background: Chromosomal inversion is one of the most important mechanisms of evolution. Recent studies of
comparative genomics have revealed that chromosomal inversions are abundant in the human genome. While
such previously characterized inversions are large enough to be identified as a single alignment or a string of local
alignments, the impact of ultramicro inversions, which are such short that the local alignments completely cover
them, on evolution is still uncertain.
Results: In this study, we developed a method for identifying ultramicro inversions by scanning of local
alignments. This technique achieved a high sensitivity and a very low rate of false positives. We identified 2,377
ultramicro inversions ranging from five to 125 bp within the orthologous alignments between the human and
chimpanzee genomes. The false positive rate was estimated to be around 4%. Based on phylogenetic profiles
using the primate outgroups, 479 ultramicro inversions were inferred to have specifically inverted in the human
lineage. Ultramicro inversions exclusively involving adenine and thymine were the most frequent; 461 inversions
(19.4%) of the total. Furthermore, the density of ultramicro inversions in chromosome Y and the neighborhoods of
transposable elements was higher than average. Sixty-five ultramicro inversions were identified within the exons of
human protein-coding genes.
Conclusions: We defined ultramicro inversions as the inverted regions equal to or smaller than 125 bp buried
within local alignments. Our observations suggest that ultramicro inversions are abundant among the human and
chimpanzee genomes, and that location of the inversions correlated with the genome structural instability. Some
of the ultramicro inversions may contribute to gene evolution. Our inversion-identification method is also
applicable in the fine-tuning of genome alignments by distinguishing ultramicro inversions from nucleotide
substitutions and indels.

Background
Chromosomal inversion, a type of genetic rearrangement
involving the inversion of a chromosome segment, is one
of the most important causes of genomic changes. Inversions have been identified as phylogenetic signatures
since the first third of the twentieth century [1] and are
thought to have affected phenotypic evolution [2]. While
large-size inversions (macroscopic inversions), microscopically-detectable and/or visible in genetic maps, were
identified early on [1,3], the recent abundance of genomic

sequences and progress in sequence analysis has enabled
the extensive detection of inversions of various sizes in
genomes. In particular, comparative genomics between
populations and between closely related species have
revealed the occurrence of numerous inversions in genomes including small-size (microscopic) inversions [4-6].
More than 1,500 inversions varying in length from 23 bp
to 62 Mb occur in the human and chimpanzee genomes,
suggesting that inversions are common mechanisms for
differentiating genomes [6]. Although several methods
have been developed to identify these inversions, they
focus only on the macroscopic or microscopic inversions
which are inversions large enough to be detected as a
single alignment or a string of local alignments [6].

Some inversions may be too small to be identified even
as a local alignment block. Such ultramicro inversions are
extremely difficult to detect using existing methods
because they may be hidden within the local alignments of
BLAST or other popular alignment softwares. These inversions are very short such that the alignment extends
beyond them allowing mismatches and gaps. In such
cases, the ultramicro-inverted regions are treated as small
arrays of mismatches and gaps within the local alignments.
The degree of overlooking the ultramicro inversions hidden within the local alignments would be higher within
the alignment between closely related genomes, because
mismatches in short regions are negligibly small for highly
similar alignments longer than ten kilobases.
These ultramicro inversions would be aligned with mismatches and gaps more frequently than would a random
distribution of such differences. Generally, mismatches
and gaps within alignments account for nucleotide substitutions and insertions and deletions (indels), respectively. However, mismatches and gaps generated at
inverted sites are a result of erroneous alignments.
Whether or not differences in the alignments are caused
by nucleotide substitutions and indels is apparently
unclear. Thus, it is difficult to obtain information about
ultramicro inversions from the local alignments themselves. Identifying ultramicro inversions within the alignments would be necessary for distinguishing the
mismatches and gaps caused by nucleotide substitutions
and indels from those caused by inversions.
The human genome is different from the chimpanzee
genome, at 1.2% of sequence mismatches [7] and 5% of
sequence mismatches plus gaps [8]. Some of these differences are assumed to play important roles in the phenotypic evolution of the human lineage. Furthermore,
macroscopic inversions are one of the major mechanisms
of differentiating species [2]. For example, pericentric
inversion is one type of large genomic rearrangements
which distinguishes the human karyotype from that of
the chimpanzee [9,10], implying that such inversions are
one of the important causes of speciation. Ultramicro
inversions may also be spread across the human and
chimpanzee genomes because the size distribution of the
macroscopic and microscopic inversions decays as the
size of the inversions increases [6]. In addition, the differences in the human-chimpanzee alignments caused by
inversions raise the average differences between the
human and chimpanzee genomes. In order to examine
the impact of ultramicro inversions on the genome alignment, we developed a method for identifying ultramicro
inversions within the alignments between the human and
chimpanzee genomes. We first generated 2.41 Gb of oneto-one (i.e., orthologous) alignments between the human
and chimpanzee genomes using the G-compass pipeline
[11,12], and identified inversions in each local alignment.

Subsequently, we examined the relationships of ultramicro inversions with the structural features of the human
genome to determine the molecular mechanisms of the
inversions. Furthermore, we examined biologically functional segments to infer the effects of the inversions on
the phenotypic evolution of the human lineage.

Results
Simulation

Firstly, we defined ultramicro inversions as the inverted
regions buried within local alignments. With this definition, most of the “ultramicro” inversions are expected to be
smaller than the “microscopic” inversions which are identified as a single alignment or a string of local alignments.
Within the local alignments, the ultramicro inversions
would be misaligned forwardly. We developed a method
for identifying such ultramicro inversions hidden within
regions of local pairwise-alignments rich in mismatches
and gaps. In such regions, erroneously aligned ultramicro
inversions would possess high density of mismatches and
gaps. Assuming that the sequence differences are spread
across the genome following a negative binominal distribution, we determined if these regions could be aligned inversely with greater similarity than the forward alignments
(See Methods). A simulation was conducted in order to
test the strength and accuracy of this algorithm using the
Indelible program [13] for evolving random sequences.
Eleven sets of pairwise nucleotide alignments were generated allowing the creation of indels, each consisting of
100,000 pairs of 5,000 bp random nucleotide sequences,
with parameters (e.g., differences and base composition)
equivalent to the human-chimpanzee genome alignments.
A short (5-50 bp) segment with fixed length was randomly
chosen and inverted in one sequence of every pair. Realigned pairwise sequences were then subjected to the
inversion identification.
Through the identification of inversions, the sensitivity
of the algorithm was found to approximately range from
0.82 to 0.91, except for the 5 and 6 bp inversions; 0.261
for 5 bp and 0.651 for 6 bp inversions (Figure 1A). Hence,
this method is particularly useful for identifying all inversions except the extremely short ones. In addition, only 14
false positives were found in a set of 100,000 pairs of
sequences (Figure 1A), suggesting a very low false-positive
rate. Only 67 false positives were expected in the humanchimpanzee alignments consisting of 2.4 Gb of alignment
sites.
Identification of inversions between the human and
chimpanzee genomes

We detected 2,377 ultramicro inversions hidden within
the one-to-one alignments between the human and
chimpanzee genomes. Interestingly, 461 inversion segments consisted of adenine and thymine exclusively

extensive information on ultramicro inversions in the

inversions excluding the AT-exclusive segments was
higher (72.0%) than the average AT content of the entire
human-chimpanzee alignments (59.3%) (Figure 2A), suggesting that ultramicro inversions preferentially occurred
in AT-rich regions. The AT-exclusive regions possess
considerably different conditions from the other regions
to the extent of AT content and thus would show different power for the inversion identification from that
assumed in the simulation in previous subsection.

inversions in simulation in the AT-exclusive condition
was less than that in the initial condition and, as well as
the initial condition, increased with increasing inversion
size from 0.218 for 5 bp inversion to 0.768 for 50 bp
inversion (Figure 1B). False positives were greater in the
AT-exclusive conditions than in the initial simulation
condition with less than 160 false positives in the 500 Mb
AT-exclusive simulation set (Figure 1B). Although 760 or
less false positives were expected in the 2.4 Gb AT-exclusive alignments, which was as large as the human-chimpanzee genome alignments, the number of false positives
in the human-chimpanzee genome alignments may have
been much lower than 760 since the AT blocks constitute small fractions of the genome. Blocks consisting of a
series of at least 5 bp of adenines and thymines were
summed at approximately 120 Mb in the human genome,
in which all the 461 AT-exclusive inversions were
included, indicating that less than 38 false positives of the
AT-exclusive inversions could be expected in the humanchimpanzee alignments.
The size of ultramicro inversions between the human
and chimpanzee genomes ranged from 5 to 125 bp (Figure
2B and the extensive information file), and the distribution
of their lengths, which was classified into three characteristics, showed a peculiar shape. While this distribution
basically decayed in a fashion similar to the macroscopic
and microscopic inversions between the human and chimpanzee genomes [6], extremely short inversions were less
frequent (Figure 2B). This is because our identification
method was less sensitive to extremely short inversions as
shown in the simulation results. The most peculiar feature
was that among the ≤13 bp inversions, ultramicro inversions with odd number lengths were more frequent than
those with even number lengths. The frequency of ultramicro inversions seemed to be independent of whether
the inversion length was odd or even in the simulations
(Figure 1A). This implies that different shapes of the distributions of the odd and even numbered-inversion lengths
were not likely because of the internal cause of the identification algorithm. In addition, we found a small peak
around 20 bp in the size distribution of the ultramicro
inversions.
While the ultramicro inversions as well as the macroscopic and microscopic inversions were spread throughout the human genome [6], the density of inversions was
significantly different on chromosome Y compared with
that on the autosomes (Figure 2C). Autosomes averaged
0.196 ± 0.0519 AT-exclusive and 0.807 ± 0.112 guanine
and cytosine-including (GC-including) inversions
per Mb. However, chromosome Y possessed more frequent inversions: 0.422 AT-exclusive inversions (p <
1.00 × 10-5) and 1.94 GC-including inversions (p < 1.00 ×
10-5) per Mb. In contrast, the numbers of AT-exclusive
and GC-including inversions on chromosome X (0.215

Page 4 of 11

and 0.906 per Mb, respectively) were not significantly different from those on the autosomes (p = 0.335 and 0.380,
respectively). In addition, the proportions of the inversion
ratios between chromosome Y and autosomes (2.16 times
for AT-exclusive and 2.41 times for GC-including inversions) are larger than the proportion of the mutation
rates (approximately 1.4 times [14]) between them. These
observations suggest that the abundance of ultramicro
inversions in chromosome Y is mainly subject to high
diversity of the genomic structures specifically in chromosome Y [14] rather than male driven evolution. One
possibility is that frequent intrachromosomal recombinations in chromosome Y [14] had been involved in frequent ultramicro inversions.
Ultramicro inversions validated by phylogenetic profiles

By comparing the ultramicro inversions within the humanchimpanzee alignments with the orthologous sequences of
the primate outgroups, the lineages in which the inversions
occurred can be inferred (Figure 3A). Generating multiple
alignments of ultramicro inversions concatenating their
neighbors of human, chimpanzee, gorilla, and/or orangutan
as outgroups, the species possessing the inverted sequences
were identified. In 1,424 ultramicro inversions out of 2,377,
the lineages in which the sequences had inverted were definitely determined (Table 1). Four hundred and seventynine and 911 inversions were identified specifically in the
human and chimpanzee sequences, respectively, suggesting
that they had occurred specifically in the human and chimpanzee lineages after the separation between the two species. On the other hand, 34 inversions appeared to be
inconsistent with the species phylogeny among human,
chimpanzee, and gorilla, suggesting incomplete lineage
sorting in the common ancestor of these three species: 20
ultramicro inversions shared between human and gorilla
and 14 between chimpanzee and gorilla (Table 1). The former represented the gene phylogeny as ((Human, Gorilla),
Chimpanzee) and the latter represented the gene phylogeny as (Human, (Chimpanzee, Gorilla)).
While our detection method for ultramicro inversions
possessed a high degree of accuracy, it is noteworthy that
these 1,424 ultramicro inversions were also supported by
the phylogenetic profiles of the outgroups. Thus, we considered that these inversions were very plausible. Out of
the rest of 953 ultramicro inversion, we could not obtained
the strong support by phylogenetic profiles in 652 ultramicro inversions and the orthologous sequences of gorilla or
orangutan in 301 ultramicro inversions.
Ultramicro inversions within genes

To examine the impact of ultramicro inversions on gene
evolution in the human lineage, we searched for ultramicro inversions within those exons defined in H-InvDB
[15], and found a total of 65 inversions (Figure 3). More

than half the inversions were identified in the 3’ UTR
region. Although 17 ultramicro inversions out of 65
were found in the coding regions, they were either
inferred to have occurred in the chimpanzee lineage

specifically (13 inversions) or not supported by the phylogenetic profiles (four inversions) (Figure 3B). The 17
genes of which ultramicro inversions were identified in
the coding regions included several well-annotated ones

Hara and Imanishi BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:308

such as tumor protein p73 (TP73), protein tyrosine
phosphatase receptor type B (PTPRB), and NADPH
oxidase organizer 1 (NOXO1). In 16 out of 17 inversions, biochemically different amino acids were observed
between human and chimpanzee. These inversions
ranges from five to 24 bp and affected the corresponding amino acid sequences from two to nine residues. In
the remaining one, a stop codon was observed in the
human sequence but not in the chimpanzee sequence:
only four amino acids were extended in the chimpanzee
sequence. These observations suggest that ultramicro
inversions in coding regions have contributed to gene
evolution mainly in the chimpanzee lineage.

Discussion
We developed a highly sensitive and distinctly specific
method for identifying ultramicro inversions hidden
within nucleotide alignments. This method could be very
effective for sequences with average base compositions of
the human and chimpanzee genomes as well as would
work well for those with extremely biased base compositions such as 100% AT content (Figure 1) with extra filtering for simple repeats. Positive predictive values
(number of true positives/(number of true positives +
number of false positives)) are more than 0.9998 for the
former case and 0.993 for the latter case, respectively.
However, this method is remarkably less sensitive for the
extra-short ultramicro inversions consisting of 5 or 6 bp
(Figure 1). There may be two plausible reasons. One is
the word size of the homology search for inverted
sequences. Our method involved using the BLAST program blastn with a word size of five to detect inversions,
which sometimes failed to capture the extra-short inversions. The other possibility is limitations in the detection
of difference-rich regions. Our method focused on the
alignment region in which a trio of difference signatures,
mismatches, and gap blocks were neighbors. Some
inverted segments can be forwardly aligned with fewer
than three differences (e.g., inversions in palindromes),
which is beyond our criteria. The frequency of hidden
inversions increases as the size decreases. Nevertheless,
as described above, this method is useful in identifying
ultramicro inversions with a high degree of specificity.
In addition to macroscopic and microscopic inversions, a
large number of ultramicro inversions, ranging from five to
125 bp, were detected between the human and chimpanzee
genomes using our method (Table 1). From this observation, we defined the size of ultramicro inversions equal to
or less than 125 bp. Based on the simulations, at most
approximately 100 false positives (4% of the total) were
expected. On an average, 0.983 ultramicro inversions were
found per Mb of the human-chimpanzee alignments.
These inversions had been treated as mismatches and gaps
in the local alignment, suggesting that the identification of

Page 6 of 11

ultramicro inversions is one of the effective ways for finetuning the local alignments. However, we found only
0.0319% and 0.126% of mismatches and gaps in the whole
human-chimpanzee genome alignments were derived from
the ultramicro inversions, respectively. The nucleotide
divergence between chimpanzees and humans before and
after excluding the ultramicro inversions was estimated at
0.013276 and 0.013271, respectively, indicating that ultramicro inversions hardly affect the nucleotide divergence
between human and chimpanzee. Still, because of the relatively low sensitivity in detecting extra-short and palindrome-like inversions, the number of ultramicro inversions
may be greater within the human-chimpanzee alignments.
One of our most important findings was the large fraction
of AT-exclusive ultramicro inversions (Figure 2A).
Our method included additional filtering of AT-exclusive
inversions, which excluded inversions consisting of monoor dinucleotide repeats of A and T. The simulation
produced indicated a very high positive predictive rate.
However, some of the AT-exclusive inversions may have
been false positives because of the unknown aspects of
genomic evolution. Filtering inversion candidates using the
phylogenic profile would generate a highly specific subset
of inversions [5]. The high frequency of odd-length inversions in nearly minimum size (Figure 2A) would be independent of the inversion identification algorithm. The
simulation indicated that our algorithm did not perform
better the ultramicro inversions in odd numbers (Figure 1).
In addition, high frequency of odd-length inversions was
observed in both odd and even numbers of the word size
for BLASTN (data not shown), suggesting that this is independent of the homology searching algorithms. These
observations implied that high frequency of odd-length
inversions in the human and chimpanzee genomes would
be involved in undefined biological causes such as the
structure of DNA strands for generating inversions.
By comparing inverted segments with the primate outgroup, 206 of the AT-exclusive inversions belonged to
this specific subset (Table 1), still suggesting frequent
AT-exclusive inversions. The inversions ranging from 23
to 125 bp could be any one of the ultramicro inversions
hidden in a local alignment or small-size inversions identified as a single or a string of local alignment [6]. Size
distribution of the inversions roughly indicated that
inversions less than 40 bp were preferably hidden in the
local alignments between the human and chimpanzee
genomes (Additional File 1: Figure S1). The ultramicro
inversions are also distinguished from larger microscopic
inversions that are detectable as a single alignment or a
string of local alignments, in that the exact boundaries of
ultramicro inversions can be identified easily within the
local alignment. This may have a significant insight into
the elucidation of the mechanism for the ultramicro
inversions.

In this study, the human-chimpanzee alignments were
generated by the G-compass pipeline [12]. Although the
G-compass pipeline is different from the UCSC axtNet
alignment [16] based on the definition of orthologous
alignments, both methods initially generate local alignments with blastz [16] or its successor lastz [17]. Thus an
equivalent number of ultramicro inversions is likely to be
obtained from the UCSC axtNet alignment. As expected,
2,364 ultramicro inversions were found in the humanchimpanzee alignments using UCSC axtNet alignment,
suggesting that most of the ultramicro inversions are independent of the G-compass pipeline. Although we have not
examined for ultramicro inversions within the genome
alignment generated by local alignments other than blastz,
differences in the ultramicro inversions between different
alignment algorithms may be helpful in verifying the behavior of the alignment algorithms involving ultramicro
inversions either erroneously aligned or excluded from the
local alignments.
Out of the 1,424 ultramicro inversions validated by
phylogenetic profiling, 911 were found to have occurred
specifically in the chimpanzee lineage, which were
approximately twice more than those (479) in the human
lineage (Table 1). Several studies have indicated that the
sequence accuracy of the chimpanzee genome is poorer
than that of the human genome [18,19] because of the
lower coverage. This may be one of the causes of the
abundance of ultramicro inversions in the chimpanzee
lineage. However, the substitutions especially those in the
chimpanzee lineage were at most 1.05 times more than
those in the human lineage [19], indicating that a large
number of ultramicro inversions in the chimpanzee lineage were unlikely to be the result of sequence errors.
Higher level of false assembles of the sequence reads in
the chimpanzee genome than the human’s might be
another explanation. It can be a cause for the false positives in the larger inversions as a single alignment or a
string of local alignments (microscopic inversions) than
ultramicro inversions. However, this may be also difficult
to explain ultramicro inversions within a local alignment.
Thus, the differences in inversion frequencies between
humans and chimpanzees give an insight into the different histories of genomic structural changes between the
two species. Furthermore, this observation ensures the
abundance of ultramicro inversions in coding regions
found specifically in the chimpanzee lineage. As shown
in Figure 3A, ultramicro inversions substitute more than
one amino acid at a time into physicochemically different
ones. The inversion in PTPRB genes in chimpanzee
(Figure 3A) had altered a string of two residues of glutamine and glycine into physicochemically different ones,
proline (residue 1229) and cysteine (residue 1230),
respectively. In contrast, the hydrophilic residue of glutamine or histidine at the corresponding site to the residue

Page 7 of 11

1229 is conserved across amniotes, and the glycine at the
corresponding site to the residue 1230 is conserved
across tereosts and tetrapods. This implies that the ultramicro inversion had altered the function of the corresponding fibronectin type III domain. This implies that
such ultramicro inversions played a role in drastic protein evolution in the chimpanzee lineage.
Although it has not been clear how ultramicro inversions have occurred, our findings of frequent ultramicro
inversions in chromosome Y and the AT-exclusive regions
suggests that ultramicro inversions are preferably located
in those genomic regions that may relate to genomic
instability. To examine the relationship between ultramicro inversions and genomic instability in detail, we compared the positions of ultramicro inversions with those of
the genomic features involved in stability of the human
genome. Ultramicro inversions significantly and frequently
overlapped on the boundaries of L1 and Alu (p < 0.001)
and were located in the region (<100 bp) closer to these
transposable elements (p < 0.001), strongly suggesting that
ultramicro inversions are associated with the genomic features generating instability as previously indicated by the
macroscopic inversions [20]. To elucidate the mechanisms
of ultramicro inversions at the molecular level, we examined the genomic features near the inverted segments and
found that cruciform formation with inverted repeats
mediated the ultramicro inversions, indicating that
inverted repeats on both ends of the inversion segments
were the signature of the cruciform-forming inversions
[21]. We found 52 ultramicro inversions sandwiched
between the inverted repeats of ≥10 bp, out of which 38
were the GC-including inversions. This represents a small
fraction of the total ultramicro inversions but is significantly greater than expected (p < 0.001), suggesting that
the ultramicro inversions were partly generated via cruciform formation. The ultramicro inversion in Figure 4 is
sandwiched between inverted repeats and was possibly
generated via the cruciform formation. The inverted
repeat next to the 3’ end of the ultramicro inversion
segment is specifically found in the human sequence. This
implies that inversion follows double-strand breaks, strand
displacement by the invading 3’ end, de novo DNA synthesis, and concomitant DNA elongation [21]. Thus, we
have shown that ultramicro inversions are related to the
genomic features involved in genomic instability, which is
a characteristic similar to that of macroscopic inversions.

Conclusions
We developed an effective method for identifying ultramicro inversions within pairwise alignments and found a
large number of ultramicro inversions within the local
alignments between the human and chimpanzee genomes.
This is the first finding of an abundance of short and
extra-short inversions within the local alignments between

closely related species. This observation suggests that a
considerable number of ultramicro inversions could be
found within the alignments between individuals from different populations. Furthermore, some of the adjacent
SNPs may be ultramicro inversions as well as large inversions observed in HapMap data [4]. Identification of ultramicro inversions within human populations may be
helpful in elucidating how phenotypic characteristics have
diversified during human evolution. While our inversionidentification method was helpful for examining the
impact of microscopic inversions, this method is also
applicable in fine tuning genome alignments by distinguishing ultramicro inversions from nucleotide substitutions and indels.

Methods
Identification method for ultramicro inversions

Ultramicro inversions were detected within a local pairwise alignment by the following two procedures: identifying difference-rich regions and searching for inverted
regions in these difference-rich regions. A region rich in
mismatches and gaps was initially detected as a trio of the
nearest mismatches and gap blocks which were more closely positioned on an alignment than expected. Each trio
consisted of either three mismatches, two mismatches and
one gap block, or one mismatch and two gap blocks that
were located in different sequences of a pair. The trio was
extracted by scanning the pairwise alignment. When a
mismatch or gap block was found and the next two mismatches and/or gaps were located within a region of n - 1
consecutive sites, the conditional probability of the trio
within n sites Ptrio(n) (n ≥ 3) was calculated by the equation given below,
Ptrio (n) = 1 − (1 − pd )n−1 − (n − 1)pd (1 − pd )n−2

where p d represents the average number of mismatches and gap blocks per site.
During the detection process, some parts of the inversions were found to be aligned without mismatches, as
follows:

The inversion of 8 bp included a palindrome in part and
was aligned with the palindrome. We called this a partially
palindromic inversion. In order to identify this kind of
inversion, we searched for the region where an identically
aligned region was sandwiched by two gap blocks inserted
in different sequences of pair. The conditional probability
of the two gap blocks within n sites Pduo(n) (n ≥ 2) is given
as follows:
Pduo (n) = 1 − (1 − pg )n−1

Page 9 of 11

where pg is the average number of the gap blocks per
site.
We extracted such trios and duos where Ptrio(n) < 0.05
or P duo (n) < 0.05. These trios and duos were merged
and then extended with 50 bp at both ends. The resultant regions were subject to subsequent analysis.
The inverted regions were detected within the difference-rich regions described above using the NCBI
BLAST program blastn [22]. For blastn, the word size
was set at five, and the query sequences were not filtered
(-p blastn -F F -W 5). If an inverted alignment region largely or completely overlapping the corresponding forward alignment, and if the inversion was aligned with
higher similarity than the corresponding forward alignment based on following the criteria stated below, we
defined the inverted region as an ultramicro inversion. (i)
For the region based on Ptrio(n) < 0.05, the inverted alignment region was completely included within the forward
alignment region, or >80% of the inverted region overlapped with the corresponding forward alignment region
whereas the rest of the inverted region was aligned as
gaps in the forward alignment. Similarity of the inverted
alignment was >0.95, which was >1.25 times higher than
that of the forward alignment. The corresponding forward alignment included the trio. (ii) For the region
based on Pduo(n) < 0.05, the corresponding region of the
forward alignment consisted of a duo of gap blocks
described above, and a region sandwiched by the gaps
was identically aligned with >50% of the segment. Similarity of the inverted alignment and coverage of the
inverted region to the forwardly aligned region were
100%. Following these procedures, we excluded the some
part of AT-exclusive inversions which could be explained
by the other mechanisms than inversions. One of the
inversions to be excluded consisted of mononucleotide
repeats of A and T such as 5’-AAATTTTTTT-3’: the
inversion 5’-AAAAAAATTT-3’ could be explained by
with stretch and shrink of the repeats. The other consisted of staggered AT dinucleotide repeats such as 5’ATATATATATA-3’: the inversion 5’-TATATATATAT3’ could be explained by insertion of deletion of A or T.
The length of ultramicro inversions was defined as the
length of the inverted segments determined by the blastn
program.
Simulation

In order to evaluate the power of our identification
method, simulations were performed using sequence
alignment sets of random sequences, each consisting of
100,000 pairs of around 5,000 bp sequences and including
an inversion in each pair. Each sequence pair was generated by the sequence evolution simulator Indelible [13],
allowing insertions and deletions (indels) from a random

Hara and Imanishi BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:308
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/308

sequence of 5,000 bp, assuming the HKY sequence substitution model [23], the indel lengths distributed with the
Lavalette distribution setting the decimal at 2 and the
maximum indel length at 50, and the prior sequence conditions similar to the human-chimpanzee genome alignment: setting the base compositions of gA, gT, gC, and gG at
0.289, 0.304, 0.203, and 0.204, respectively, the transition/
transversion ratio at 1.75, the average of sequence substitutions per site at 1.00, the indel/substitution ratio at
0.159, and the shape parameter for the gamma distribution
and the number of categories for the discrete gamma
approximation set at 0.65 and 5, respectively. A short
region of 5 to 50 bp length in one sequence of each pair
was inverted, and the pair was aligned with MAFFT [24].
The inversion lengths were fixed in all the 100,000 pairs of
a sequence alignment set. We generated eleven sequence
alignment sets with 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 50
bp inversions. The other sequence alignment groups were
generated for assessing the intensity of AT-exclusive
sequences. The sequence models and prior sequence parameters were equal to the simulation above except for the
base compositions; (gA, gT, gC, gG) = (0.5, 0.5, 0, 0). For the
AT-exclusive alignments, seven alignment sets were generated, and 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 50 bp inversions were
included in the individual alignment sets. In these simulations, p d and p g were set at 0.0100 and 0.00150,
respectively.
Identification of the ultramicro inversions within the
human-chimpanzee alignments

To identify ultramicro inversions within the alignments
between the human and chimpanzee genomes, one-toone (i.e., orthologous) alignments were generated
between the human and chimpanzee using the hg19
human genomic sequence and panTro2 chimpanzee
genomic sequence from the UCSC genome browser
(http://genome.ucsc.edu/). The alignments were constructed with the G-compass pipeline [11,12] based on
the blastz local alignments [16] and its unique and nonredundant reciprocal best hits. Applying the method
above after setting p d and p g at 0.0136 and 0.00150
respectively, we obtained ultramicro inversions within
the human-chimpanzee alignments.
The human-gorilla and human-orangutan one-to-one
alignments were generated by the same procedures, using
the gorGor3 gorilla and ponAbe2 orangutan genomic
sequences from the UCSC genome browser. The humanchimpanzee alignments including the ultramicro inversions were grouped with the human-gorilla and humanorangutan alignments in which the human sequence overlapped the inversion segments in the human-chimpanzee
alignments by a single linkage. In each group, the human,
chimpanzee, and gorilla and/or orangutan sequences were
multiply aligned by MAFFT [24].

Page 10 of 11

The validation of ultramicro inversions was performed
using these multiple alignments. In the alignment sites
of the inversions, if fewer than two mismatches or gaps
were found between the human and outgroup sequences
and three or more mismatches or gaps were found
between the chimpanzee and outgroup sequences, we
concluded that the chimpanzee sequence had been
inverted. The human inverted sequences were also
detected in the same way. If the phylogenetic profile of
the inversion was inconsistent with the species phylogeny among human, chimpanzee, and gorilla, the inversion was verified with the incomplete lineage sorting.
In order to relate ultramicro inversions to the genomic
features, we used two kinds of genomic tracks available
from the public database. Mapping information of exons
and coding regions of human transcripts on the human
genome were obtained from H-InvDB version 7.5 (http://
hinv.jp/hinv/ahg-db/) [15]. Mapping information of Alu
and L1 was obtained from the chromOut repeat-masking
annotation files on the human genome from the UCSC
genome browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu/). To determine
if ultramicro inversions preferentially occur in the neighborhood of transposable elements, we conducted a 1,000
times trial of the random distribution of the short segments on the human genome. Given that the size distribution of 2,377 short segments was identical to that of the
ultramicro inversions within the local alignments between
the human and chimpanzee genomes, these segments
were randomly distributed on the human genome. Frequency distributions of every 100 bp of genomic distances
between the segment and nearest transportable element
were computed. If a boundary of the mobile element was
included in the ultramicro inversion, the distance was set
to zero. Frequencies of the short segments in every 100 bp
were counted from the 1,000 times trial of the random distribution. The value of p < 0.001 indicates no appearance
of the short segment in the trial. We applied this procedure to determine if the inverted repeats were usually
located on both ends of the ultramicro inversion. We also
investigated the possibility that the inverted repeats were
randomly distributed on both ends of the short segments
instead of calculating the distance from the short segments
to the transposable elements.

genomes are available from http://hinv.jp/g-compass/
