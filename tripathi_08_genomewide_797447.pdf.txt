Abstract
Background: Serine proteases are one of the most abundant groups of proteolytic enzymes found
in all the kingdoms of life. While studies have established significant roles for many prokaryotic
serine proteases in several physiological processes, such as those associated with metabolism, cell
signalling, defense response and development, functional associations for a large number of
prokaryotic serine proteases are relatively unknown. Current analysis is aimed at understanding
the distribution and probable biological functions of the select serine proteases encoded in
representative prokaryotic organisms.
Results: A total of 966 putative serine proteases, belonging to five families, were identified in the
91 prokaryotic genomes using various sensitive sequence search techniques. Phylogenetic analysis
reveals several species-specific clusters of serine proteases suggesting their possible involvement in
organism-specific functions. Atypical phylogenetic associations suggest an important role for lateral
gene transfer events in facilitating the widespread distribution of the serine proteases in the
prokaryotes. Domain organisations of the gene products were analysed, employing sensitive
sequence search methods, to infer their probable biological functions. Trypsin, subtilisin and Lon
protease families account for a significant proportion of the multi-domain representatives, while
the D-Ala-D-Ala carboxypeptidase and the Clp protease families are mostly single-domain
polypeptides in prokaryotes. Regulatory domains for protein interaction, signalling, pathogenesis,
cell adhesion etc. were found tethered to the serine protease domains. Some domain combinations
(such as S1-PDZ; LON-AAA-S16 etc.) were found to be widespread in the prokaryotic lineages
suggesting a critical role in prokaryotes.
Conclusion: Domain architectures of many serine proteases and their homologues identified in
prokaryotes are very different from those observed in eukaryotes, suggesting distinct roles for
serine proteases in prokaryotes. Many domain combinations were found unique to specific
prokaryotic species, suggesting functional specialisation in various cellular and physiological
processes.

Background
The proper functioning of a cell is facilitated by a precise
regulation of protein levels, which in turn is maintained
by a balance between the rates of protein synthesis and
degradation. Protein degradation mediated by proteolysis
is an important mechanism for recycling of the amino
acids into the cellular pool and to possibly generate
energy during starvation. Proteins like enzymes, transcription factors, receptors, structural proteins etc. require proteolytic processing for activation or functional changes.
Proteolysis also contributes to the timely inactivation of
proteins and is a major biological regulatory mechanism
in living systems [1-4].
Serine proteases are ubiquitous enzymes with a nucleophilic Ser residue at the active site and believed to constitute nearly one-third of all the known proteolytic
enzymes. They include exopeptidases and endopeptidases
belonging to different protein families grouped into clans.
Over 50 serine protease families are currently classified by
MEROPS [5]. They function in diverse biological processes such as digestion, blood clotting, fertilisation, development, complement activation, pathogenesis, apoptosis,
immune response, secondary metabolism, with imbalances causing diseases like arthritis and tumors [6-9].
Thus, many serine proteases and their substrates are
attractive targets for therapeutic drug design.
Proteases play a significant role in adaptive responses of
prokaryotes to changes in their extracellular environment
by facilitating restructuring of their proteomes. Prokaryotic serine proteases are involved in several physiological
processes associated with cell signalling, defense response
and development [3,10,11]. DegP proteases belonging to
the trypsin family have been implicated in heat shock
response [12], subtilisins in growth and defense response
in several bacteria [13], in nutrition and host invasion
[14], serine β-lactamases in helping certain bacteria
acquire resistance to β-lactam antibiotics [15] and Clp and
Lon proteases in the removal of the misfolded proteins
[16]. In addition, serine proteases are required for virulence in many pathogenic bacteria [17,18]. However, an
understanding of the biological functions of large numbers of prokaryotic serine proteases remains elusive. A better understanding of their distribution and evolution in
the prokaryotic lineages would help unravel their potential roles in the various cellular processes including pathogenesis and help develop effective antibacterial therapies.
Therefore, five serine protease families- Trypsin (MEROPS
S1), Subtilisins (MEROPS S8), DD-peptidases (MEROPS
S12), Clp proteases (MEROPS S14) and Lon proteases
(MEROPS S16), which have been implicated in diverse
physiological processes in prokaryotes and represent
some of the independent evolutionary lineages of the ser-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/549

ine proteases were chosen as the model representatives for
a genome-wide survey in select prokaryotic genomes.
The availability of the complete protein sequences of several bacterial and archaeal species makes it possible to
carry out a comprehensive analysis to examine the complexity and the evolutionary relationships between the
serine protease families and identify new proteolytic components in prokaryotes. Bioinformatics searches for the
serine protease-like proteins belonging to the five serine
protease families were performed in the 91 representative
prokaryotic genomes (17 archaeal and 74 bacterial) for
which complete genomic data are available, using various
sensitive sequence search methods. Manual analysis was
performed for serine proteases, identified above, to assess
the presence or absence of key residues responsible for
catalysis and substrate specificity. In several serine proteases, adjacent domains are often responsible for substrate specificity and/or involvement of serine proteases
into specific physiological pathways. Therefore, the
domain organisations of the putative serine proteases predicted based on the sequence similarity were analysed to
understand their evolution and the probable biological
roles.

Methods
Search for Serine Proteases in Prokaryotic Genomes
Complete proteomes for the 91 representative prokaryotic
species were obtained from NCBI [19]. To facilitate the
coverage of the serine protease repertoire in diverse genotypes, the proteomes of the select prokaryotes representing the different taxonomic lineages in prokaryotes and
occupying diverse ecological niches were chosen for the
analysis. These include extremophiles (such as Aeropyrum
pernix- hyperthermophilic, Halobacterium- halophilic etc.);
commercially significant microorganisms (Corynebacterium efficiens); pathogenic prokaryotes that infect bacteria,
insects, plants, animals and humans (such as Mycobacterium leprae, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus), symbiotic prokaryotes (Azoarcus; Bradyrhizobium
japonicum), model organisms (Synechocystis, Ralstonia
eutropha) etc. A search for serine proteases was performed
using BLASTP [20] on the prokaryotic proteomes, using
sequences for each serine protease family, as classified by
MEROPS [5] for preliminary queries, complemented by a
multi-fold approach that employs sensitive sequence
search methods such as HMMPFAM [21] and RPS-BLAST
[22] as described previously [23].
Relative Densities of Distribution of Serine Proteases in
Prokaryotic Genomes
The relative abundance of the five serine protease families
in various prokaryotic lineages was also examined in the
form of their relative densities. Relative density is defined
here as the total number of serine proteases identified in

Page 2 of 28

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:549

a taxonomic lineage divided by the total number of
genomes of that lineage considered for the study. Comparison of relative density values provides insights into
the relative significance of the five serine protease families
in different prokaryotic lineages, which in combination
with the data from other sources such as phylogeny and
domain architectures can provide useful insights into
their probable functional associations.
Identification of Co-existing Domains in Prokaryotic
Serine Proteases
Co-existing domains were predicted using HMMPFAM of
the HMMER suite [21]. Each serine protease sequence was
matched to the dataset of Hidden Markov Models
(HMMs) obtained from the PfamA database [24] with the
E-value thresholds set to 0.1 [23]. Conservation of the
domain architectures across the lineages was examined
with NCBI-CDART [25] and Pfam [24].
Multiple Sequence Alignment and Phylogenetic Analysis
Multiple sequence alignments of the serine protease
domains were performed using CLUSTALW [26]; an overall phylogenetic tree was inferred from the multiple
sequence alignment with PHYLIP (Phylogeny Inference
Package) [27] and phylogenetic analysis was performed as
described previously [23]. Representations of the calculated trees were constructed using MEGA program [28].
Clusters with bootstrap values greater than 50% were
defined as confirmed subgroups and sequences with
lower values added to these subgroups according to their
sequence similarity in the alignment as judged by visual
inspection.

Results and discussion
Distribution of the Five Serine Protease Families in the
Prokaryotic Genomes
A total of 966 serine proteases belonging to the five serine
protease families were identified in the 91 prokaryotic
genomes for which the complete genomic data is available. These include 42 putative catalytically inactive serine
protease homologues (hereafter uniformly referred to as
SPHs) that either lack the amino acid residues essential for
catalysis or carry amino acid substitutions at those positions. Such inactive enzyme homologues are present in
many enzyme families and are believed to acquire newer
functions during evolution [29,30] (Additional file 1).
Trypsin (S1), subtilisin (S8) and D-Ala-D-Ala carboxypeptidase (DD-peptidase) (S12) families were found to
have a higher number of representatives than Clp protease
(S14) and Lon protease (S16) families (Table 1). The five
serine protease families have a relatively lower representation in the archaeal genomes than the bacterial genomes.
However, the relative densities (see Methods) of subtilisin
and Lon protease families (S8 and S16 are 2.46 and 1.2,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/549

respectively) in archaeal genomes are much higher than
other three families (0.33) (Table 2). The DD-peptidase
family shows maximum abundance in the Alphaproteobacteria (relative density 7.1), while trypsins, subtilisins
and Clp proteases have higher number of representatives
in the Actinobacteria (relative densities 6.37, 4.1 and
2.37, respectively) and Lon proteases in the Gammaproteobacteria (relative density 2.4). Higher densities for
trypsins, subtilisins and Lon proteases are observed in the
Delatproteobacteria, largely due to only two Deltaproteobacteria genomes considered for the present analysis and
the overrepresentation of the trypsins and the subtilisins
in Bdellovibrio_bacteriovorus. High representations of some
serine proteases were observed in other genomes such as
Streptomyces avermitilis, indicating specific requirements
(Tables 1, 2). Expansion of the specific protein families
and/or superfamilies often occurs as a consequence of
specialisation of an organism for its environmental niche
and an investigation of the relative abundance of the specific protein families within the different prokaryotic species is likely to provide useful insights into their evolution
and specialisation [31,32]. Thus, higher representation of
the trypsin, subtilisin and the DD-peptidase families suggests the evolution of specialised functions for the gene
products corresponding to the three families in many representative species chosen for the present analysis (Additional file 2). Putative serine proteases thus, identified,
were further analysed for the presence of the co-existing
domains. The occurrence, the domain organisation and
the phylogenetic patterns of the select serine protease
domains in the specific prokaryotic genomes are discussed below.
Trypsin (S1 Family)
Trypsins (or S1 proteases) constitute the largest group of
proteolytic enzymes that display diverse specificities and
function as endopeptidases. Their catalytic apparatus consists of the conserved Asp(102)-His(57)-Ser(195) "charge
relay" system, called the catalytic triad. This triad was initially identified in trypsin-like serine proteases and later
found in the other distinct folds such as subtilisins, serine
carboxypeptidases and Clp proteases, though the catalytic
residues occur in a different order in their sequences: a
typical example of convergent evolution of the same biochemical mechanism in structurally distinct folds
[6,33,34]. Broadly, three main activity types for cleavage
of amide substrates have been recognised for this enzyme
family: trypsin-like enzymes show overwhelming preference for Arg/Lys at the P1 site (first substrate amino acid
N-terminal to the scissile bond), chymotrypsin-like
enzymes prefer aromatic amino acids at the P1 position,
while elastase-like enzymes prefer substrates with small
hydrophobic amino acids at P1 positions [5]. In prokaryotes, trypsin-like serine proteases function in diverse proc-

esses such as bacterial cell wall lysis [35], heat shock
response [12], transcription regulation [36], as toxins
[37], as fibrinolytic enzymes [38]etc.
A total of 247 putative trypsin-like serine proteases (2
SPHs) were identified in the 91 prokaryotic genomes
under study (Additional file 1). They are well-represented
in all the prokaryotic lineages considered in the present
analyses, though a low representation was observed in
archaeal genomes (Tables 1, 2). Over half of the trypsinlike proteins identified in the present study were found to
be multi-domain polypeptides. A significant number of
the eukaryotic trypsin-like serine proteases have been
found to carry accessory domains, which are believed to
contribute to their functional diversity [23,30,39]. This
suggests that the ancillary domains in the prokaryotic
trypsin homologues may contribute to diversification in
their function. Distribution of the trypsin-like serine proteases was not uniform across the genomes considered
here (Tables 1, 2). Their over-representation in some species is probably a consequence of the organisms' adaptation to their environment. For instance, the highest
numbers of trypsin-like proteins were identified in Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus (a highly motile Gram-negative bacterium) that preys on the other Gram-negative bacteria,
which include plant, animal and human pathogens. The
bacterium employs an extensive array of hydrolytic
enzymes to invade its prey and consume the host biopolymers such as proteins. Proteases constitute the largest

group of such paralogous hydrolytic enzymes, strongly
suggesting their significant contribution to the life cycle of
the bacterium [40]. The present analysis reveals a high
abundance of the trypsin-like proteins in Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus (24 gene products; Table 1). Considering that
trypsin-like serine proteases (such as alpha-lytic protease)
are known to function in bacterial cell wall lysis [35], it is
likely that many trypsin-like proteins in Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus may be associated with its predatory activities.
Since all but one of these trypsin-like proteins are singledomain proteins (Additional file 1), it is likely that a precise and timely regulation of gene expression patterns may
play a major role in regulating their activity [40].
Phylogenetic analysis reveals the presence of several taxaspecific and species-specific clusters of the trypsin-like
proteins in the prokaryotes (Figure 1). Trypsin-like proteins identified in Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus were found to
cluster into four major groups (Figure 1). Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus deploys its hydrolytic arsenal at three distinct
stages of its lifecycle [40], therefore, it is possible that various lineages of Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus trypsin-like proteins identified here may represent putative components
of the hydrolytic machinery that drives the bacterium's
predatory lifestyle. This makes them an attractive target
for further characterisation, which may help to understand their mechanism of action better and aid in the
development of new anti-microbial strategies. Trypsinlike proteins accompanied by Colicin_V domains, which

Phylogenetic analysis of the trypsins
Phylogenetic analysis of the trypsins. A neighbour-joining tree based on an alignment of the trypsin protease domain generated with ClustalW [26], was inferred using the PHYLIP package [27] and drawn using the MEGA program [28] (see text for
details). The various taxonomic lineages encountered in the analysis are represented in the different colours. For clarity, the
protein identifiers are suffixed with the abbreviated species IDs (see Additional file 2). Only the protein clusters supported by
significant bootstrap values (> 50%) are highlighted with the colour scheme. For the rest only the gene (and species) identifiers
are highlighted with the colour scheme. The primary branches in the clusters populated by the representatives from non-identical lineage (taxa) are shaded in grey. Atypical members in an otherwise strong cluster are highlighted in the colour of their
corresponding lineage. The phylogenetic clade corresponding to the trypsin-like proteins that carry the Colicin_V-S1 domain
architecture is shaded pink. The colour schemes for the various lineages are as follows: Actinobacteria- Magenta; Alphaproteobacteria- Orange; Archaea- Red; Betaproteobacteria- Brown; Chlorobi- Olive green; Cyanobacteria- Green; Deltaproteobacteria- Yellow; Firmicutes- Cyan; Gammaprot- Gammaproteobacteria- Blue; Others- Black.

are believed to function in pathogenesis, were observed
only in the Gram-positive bacteria (Actinobacteria). In the
phylogenetic trees constructed with the protease domains
alone, all the trypsin-like proteins associated with a
Colicin_V domain fall into a single cluster (Figure 1).
Since co-existing domains in a multi-domain protein are
often known to spatially interact with each other, the
interface regions in the trypsin protease domain may
acquire a pattern uniquely different from the homologous
domains. Phylogenetic analysis also reveals clusters of
trypsin-like proteins populated by members from different taxa, providing important clues to the evolution of
this gene family in prokaryotes. For instance, while the
trypsin-like protein NP_924281.1 from Gloeobacter violaceus co-clusters with the other trypsin-like proteins from
cyanobacteria (labelled green), the other trypsin-like proteins from the same genome co-cluster with trypsin-like
proteins from other taxa. For example, NP_926204.1 coclusters with NP_388106.1 from Bacillus subtilis (Firmicutes), while NP_925645.1 co-clusters with NP_948653.1
from Rhodopseudomonas palustris (Alphaproteobacteria).
Such occurrence may indicate a putative horizontal gene
transfer of some trypsin-like proteins between Gloeobacter
violaceus, a cyanobacterium and the other taxa (Figure 1).
Indeed, horizontal gene transfer events have been documented between cyanobacteria and other phyla [41]. The
abundance of the trypsin-like proteins in the prokaryotes
may have partly resulted from the multiple horizontal
gene transfer events between different species.
Subtilisin (S8 Family)
Subtilisins constitute the second largest family of serine
proteases identified till date and known members span
across eubacteria, archaebacteria, eukaryotes and viruses.
Subtilisins utilise a highly conserved catalytic triad similar
to the members of the trypsin family, but have a different
order of the Asp, His and Ser residues in the sequence
(D137, H168, S325). Most members of the family exhibit
broad substrate specificity, with a preference to cleave
after the hydrophobic residues; however, some members
of the S8B subfamily cleave peptide bonds just after dibasic amino acids [42]. Subtilisins in prokaryotes function
in diverse processes such as cellular nutrition and host
invasion [14], facilitating the maturation of diverse
polypeptides [43] such as bacteriocins like lantibiotics
[44], extracellular adhesins [45], enzymes such as the
spore cortex-lytic enzyme in Clostridium perfringens
[46]etc. Most known subtilisins are multi-domain
polypeptides that consist of a protease domain accompanied by one or two co-existing domains [23], which also
accounts for the diversity in their function.

A total of 227 subtilisin-like proteins (8 SPHs) were identified in the present study (Additional file 1). They are well
represented in all the prokaryotic lineages suggesting that

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/549

the subtilisin repertoires were established early in evolution (Tables 1, 2). A significant number of subtilisin-like
proteins were identified in Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus, a
predatory Gram-negative bacterium (15 gene products;
Table 1) were found to fall into distinct clusters (Figure 2).
Since prokaryotic subtilisins are known to function in the
physiological processes associated with pathogenesis such
as host invasion [14], it is likely that some subtilisin-like
proteins may function as the specific components of the
hydrolytic machinery employed by Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus for predation on the other Gram-negative bacteria
[40]; the presence of the co-existing domains adjacent to
the protease domain in many of these subtilisin-like proteins may also influence their involvement in different
pathways, which in turn may regulate the predatory lifestyle of the bacterium (Table 3; Additional file 1). A significant number of the subtilisin-like proteins were also
identified in Streptomyces avermitilis (15 gene products;
Table 1), a commercially important Gram-positive soil
bacterium known for its diversity in the production of the
secondary metabolites. To facilitate this diversity, the bacterium contains several metabolic pathways for the biosynthesis of the secondary metabolites [47]. Subtilisins
are known to function as the maturation proteases for several enzymes [43], and may thus, regulate the components of various metabolic pathways in Streptomyces
avermitilis. Subtilisins are also known to function as maturation enzymes for the bacteriocin-like lantibiotics [44],
which are peptide antibiotics produced by the Gram-positive bacteria [48]. It is likely that some subtilisins may
process similar peptide antibiotics synthesised in Streptomyces avermitilis, thereby regulating their activity. Co-existing domains, associated with some subtilisin-like proteins
in Streptomyces avermitilis (Table 3, Additional file 1), may
facilitate the involvement these gene products for a regulatory role in the different metabolic pathways or for the
recognition and processing (or even degradation) of the
various secondary metabolites. However, for the other
single domain proteins (Additional file 1), a precise and
timely regulation of their transcription may play a major
role in regulating their activity.
Phylogenetic analysis reveals the presence of several taxaspecific and species-specific clusters of subtilisin-like proteins (Figure 2). Subtilisin-like proteins identified in Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus were found to fall into different
clusters that may correspond to gene products associated
with the predatory machinery of the bacterium (Figure 2).
Five major clusters of the subtilisin-like proteins in Streptomyces avermitilis were also recognised, indicating the
evolutionary and possibly the functional diversity of these
gene products in the bacterium (Figure 2). Like trypsins,
some subtilisin-like proteins associated with the specific
co-existing modules cluster together in the phylogenetic
tree constructed with the subtilisin protease domain

from the Gram-positive bacteria (Firmicutes) that at least

carry a DUF1034 module, C-terminal to the predicted

D-Ala-D-Ala carboxypeptidase B Family (S12)
The D-Ala-D-Ala carboxypeptidase B (DD-peptidase)
family is a diverse family that consists of proteins performing varied functions such as D-Alanyl-D-alanine carboxypeptidase B (DD-peptidase), aminopeptidase
(DmpB), class A, C β-lactamases etc. DD-peptidases (Penicillin binding proteins/PBPs) are β-lactam sensitive
enzymes that process precursor peptides that facilitate
peptidoglycan cross-linking during bacterial cell wall biosynthesis [49]. Studies have led to the identification of
their active site residues (S93, K96, Y190). The active site
Ser and Lys residues form a sequential motif that is highly
conserved across family members. The Tyr active site residue occurs in a conserved Y-x-N motif situated on a loop
in the all α-domain, with Tyr residue being replaced by Ser
in some proteins [15,50,51]. β-lactamases are hydrolases
that catalyse the hydrolysis of the β-lactam ring of βlactam antibiotics such as penicillins. and probably
evolved as a means of protection against the β-lactam
antibiotics that restrict the sacular growth (peptidoglycan
biosynthesis) in bacteria by inhibiting DD-peptidase
activity [15,50,52]. Class A (penicillinase type) proteins
were the first to be identified and are the most common βlactamases. DD-peptidase-like proteins are widespread in
the bacterial genomes, and their corresponding genes may
occur on bacterial chromosomes or on plasmids. This
allows for their transfer to the distant species and may
account for their distribution and diversity [51-53]. The
absence of DD-peptidase-like proteins in most eukaryotic

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/549

lineages is attributed to the absence of peptidoglycans
especially in metazoa [54,55].
A total of 254 DD-peptidase-like proteins (9 SPHs) were
identified in the current analysis (Tables 1, 2; Additional
file 1). While they display a widespread distribution in the
bacteria, a low representation is observed for these
enzymes in the archaeal genomes considered in the
present study (Table 1, Additional file 1). This is probably
due to the different pathways for cell wall biosynthesis in
archaea which involve pseudomureins. The abundance of
the DD-peptidase-like proteins in bacterial lineages is
attributed to their ancient evolution as important constituents of the cell wall biosynthesis in bacteria, specialisation of a significant repertoire as β-lactamases for
protection against the β-lactam compounds and their
retention in adaptation to probable subsequent modifications in the β-lactam synthesising pathways that share the
ACV synthetase gene, which is widely distributed in the
bacterial genomes [15]. A closer inspection of the distribution of the DD-peptidase-like proteins in the prokaryotic species considered in the present study reveals a high
representation in the genomes of some pathogenic bacteria: Bacillus anthracis Ames (14 gene products), Bacillus
thuringiensis konkukian (17 gene products), Bradyrhizobium
japonicum (17 gene products), Mycobacterium tuberculosis
(13 gene products) and Streptomyces avermitilis (13 gene
products) (Table 1). For effective pathogenesis, these bacteria deploy an extensive arsenal of biomolecules or virulence factors that would allow them to overcome host
defense machinery and appropriate their resources. Studies have highlighted that the peptidoglycan turnover and
the release of derivative elicitor molecules such as
muropeptides, facilitated by the DD-Peptidases plays significant roles in pathogenesis [56]. Antibiotic compounds
form a major component of bacterial defense response
against invading pathogenic bacteria and thus, the latter
would require mechanisms to neutralise such compounds
for successful invasion. The significant representation of
the DD-peptidase-like proteins (which are likely to
include some β-lactamases) in these genomes suggest that
some of them may have been recruited as the components
of the invasive machinery deployed to neutralise host
defenses and facilitate effective pathogenesis.
Phylogenetic analysis shows the presence of several clusters of DD-peptidase-like proteins (Figure 3). While several clusters of taxa-specific and species-specific DDpeptidase-like proteins were observed, several clusters
were populated by proteins from distinct species. For
instance, a DD-peptidase-like protein YP_004371.1 (Thermus thermophilus HB27) co-clusters with proteins from
Alphaproteobacteria
Bradyrhizobium
japonicum
(NP_772081.1,

Clp protease Family (S14)
Clp proteases are a group of ATP-dependent serine
endopeptidases [5]. E. coli ClpP is an ATP-dependent serine protease consisting of a smaller protease subunit ClpP,
and a larger chaperone regulatory ATPase subunit (either
ClpA or ClpX). Though the protease domain is capable of
proteolysis on its own, ATPase subunits are essential for
effective levels of proteolysis. The catalytic triad residues
Ser-His-Asp (S111, H136, D185) are enclosed in a single
cavity that allows for degradation of small peptides but
precludes the entry of the large folded polypeptides
[16,57,58]. Clp proteases do not show any strict specificity for the residues at the P1 or P1' positions in their substrates, but seem to prefer hydrophobic or non-polar
residues at these positions [5].

A total of 121 Clp protease-like proteins (21 SPHs) were
identified in the present study (Tables 1 and 2; Additional
file 1). Phylogenetic analysis shows the presence of many
clusters of Clp protease-like proteins and significantly
populated clusters were identified for Firmicutes, Gammaproteobacteria, Cyanobacteria and Actinobacteria (Figure 4). This is consistent with observations on diversity of
Clp protease functions in various prokaryotic lineages
[59] that they have been implicated in radioresistance and
regulating cell division in Deinococcus radiodurans [60],
regulating metabolic pathways associated with nutrition
in Bacillus subtilis [61], regulation of zinc homeostasis in
E. coli [62], cell viability in cyanobacterium Synechococcus
[63] and survival during stationary phase in E. coli [16]etc.
Phylogeny also reveals co-clustering of Clp protease-like
proteins from distinct species. NP_108601.1 (Mesorhizobium loti) co-clusters with YP_439243.1 (Burkholderia thailandensis) and NP_888239.1 (Bordetella bronchiseptica)
suggesting a putative lateral transfer of some Clp protease
gene products between these bacterial species. Similarly,
YP_161139.1 (Azoarcus sp EBN1) co-clusters with
NP_297801 (Xylella fastidiosa), YP_259115.1 (Pseudomonas fluorescens) and NP_745189.1 (Pseudomonas putida) suggesting multiple lateral transfer of Clp proteaselike proteins between the bacterial species. Yet another
instance of probable lateral transfer of Clp proteases was
observed with the co-clustering of NP_355226.1 (Agrobacterium tumefaciens) with NP_252016.1 (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and NP_433616.1 (Hahella chejuensis) (Figure 4)
suggesting that the distribution of Clp proteases in
prokaryotes may have been facilitated by multiple lateral
gene transfer events.
Lon protease Family (S16)
Lon proteases are a group of ATP-dependent serine proteases, where unlike the Clp proteases, the catalytic protease domain and the ATPase domain reside in the same
polypeptide. E. coli Lon protease was the first ATPdependent protease to be described and consists of three

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/549

functional domains: the N-terminal domain (LON), a
central ATPase domain (AAA+ module) and a C-terminal
proteolytic domain (Lon_C). The N-terminal LON
domain, along with the AAA module, is believed to
impart substrate specificity to Lon proteases. Lon proteases employ a Ser-Lys (S679, K/R722) catalytic dyad.
Based on the conservation of residues around the catalytic
serine residue, Lon proteases maybe divided into two subfamilies LonA (PKDGPSA) and LonB ([E/D]GDSA [S/T])
[57,64]. They display broad sequence specificity in
degrading polypeptides, with a slight preference for
hydrophobic residues at P1 position [5]. In addition to
their role in protein quality control by removal of misfolded proteins, Lon proteases are known to regulate a
variety of physiological processes such as cell differentiation, sporulation, pathogenicity and stress response in
bacteria [65].
A total of 117 Lon protease homologues (2 SPHs) were
identified in the present analysis. They display a higher
representation in Euryarchaeota than trypsins, DD-peptidases and Clp proteases (Tables 1 and 2). Based on the
conservation of the residues around the catalytic serine,
most Lon protease homologues identified here correspond to the LonA subfamily. However, a significant
number of the archaeal and the bacterial Lon proteases
were identified as belonging to the LonB subfamily. Phylogenetic analysis reveals several taxa and species-specific
clusters of the Lon proteases (Figure 5). Lon protease-like
proteins identified as the LonB subfamily members fall
into a single cluster, which includes two subclusters of the
bacterial and the archaeal Lon proteases. While, most bacterial LonB proteins identified here belong to the Gramnegative bacteria (mostly Gammaproteobacteria), a few
homologues were identified in the Gram-positive bacteria
(such as YP_644688.1 in Rubrobacter xylanophilus) (Figure
5; Additional file 1). Distinct subclusters of archaeal and
bacterial LonB members suggest diversification of the
LonB repertoire in the two kingdoms as a consequence of
the organisms' adaptation to their specific environments.
However, phylogeny also reveals co-clustering of bacterial
LonB members from distinct species (Figure 5).
YP_644688.1 was observed to co-cluster with
YP_374229.1
(Pelodictyon
luteolum;
Chlorobi);
NP_623361.1 (Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis; Firmicutes); NP_953479.1 (Geobacter sulfurreducens; Deltaproteobacteria) etc suggesting that some of the LonB-like
proteins in bacteria were disseminated to different species
through multiple lateral gene transfer events (Figure 5).
Similar inferences can be drawn based on the clustering
observed for archaeal Lon protease-like proteins. For
instance, an archaeal LonB-like protein YP_183677.1
from Thermococcus kodakaraensis KOD1 closely associates
with NP_127256.1 (Pyrococcus abyssi) and NP_578196.1
(Pyrococcus furiosus). Similarly, a Thermococcus kodakaraen-

NP_579167.1 (Pyrococcus furiosus) (Figure 5). Literature
reports have suggested the possibility of horizontal gene
transfer between Thermococcus kodakaraensis and Pyrococcus sp. [66] suggesting a lateral transfer of Lon proteaselike proteins in the three archaeal species. In another

instance, a bacterial Lon protease-like protein
NP_968991.1 (Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus) co-clusters with
two archaeal Lon protease-like proteins NP_616787.1
(Methanosarcina acetovirans) and NP_635142.1 (Methanosarcina mazei), suggesting the possibility of the lateral
transfer of Lon protease genes between bacteria and
archaea (Figure 5).

Phylogenetic analysis of the Lon proteases carried out as described in Figure 1. Abbreviations and the colour
schemes are the same as in Figure 1 except for those employed for phylogenetic clades comprising LonB proteins. Subclusters
of bacterial (green) and archaeal (pink) LonB homologues can be visualised.
Analysis of Domain Architectures
Serine protease-like domains often exist as a part of multidomain polypeptides. In several enzyme families, changes
in the domain alliances are known to modulate the
enzyme function, usually by altering the substrate specificity or enzyme efficiency. The co-existing domains may
also play a key role in the substrate specificity of these pro-

teins, either by facilitating protein-protein interactions or
their specific involvement in pathways [67,68]. Such additional modules may introduce newer and more diverse
functions for the serine proteases in the various cellular
networks. Therefore, an investigation of various domain
combinations in serine protease families would be
extremely useful in further understanding of their evolu-

tion and the biological functions. The domain architectures of serine protease-like proteins identified in the
present study were carefully examined using sensitive
sequence and profile search procedures and the known
functions of the domains tethered to the serine protease
domains were taken into consideration to approximate
the putative functional associations for the multi-domain
serine protease-like proteins. The propensity of the five
families to harbour co-existing domains and the tendency
for specific co-existing domains was also analysed. The
distribution of the varied domain combinations and the
known functions of the co-existing domains associated
with the serine protease domain in these proteins were
employed to obtain insights into their probable biological
function associations.
Single Domain vs Multi-domain Serine Proteases
Of the 966 serine protease-like proteins identified in the
present study, 311 (32%) were found to carry co-existing
domains. However, the distribution of the multi-domain
proteins is not uniform across the five families, which display unequal preferences to enter into domain alliances.

While, trypsins and subtilisins have a significant proportion of the multi-domain representatives, DD-peptidases
and Clp proteases are overwhelmingly single-domain
polypeptides. Most Lon protease representatives are
multi-domain proteins (Figure 6; Table 2). While some
protein domain superfamilies are highly versatile and
may co-exist with diverse neighbouring domains, some
others have a limited repertoire of partner domains [67].
Different domain combinations contribute to functional
diversity within and across the lineages [69]. Different
propensities of the five serine protease families to form
diverse domain combinations may be indicative of selection pressures and possible functional associations. The
diversity in the domain combinations and their possible
implications for individual serine protease families is discussed below.
Domain Architectures in the Tryspin (S1) Family
Of the 247 gene products identified as harbouring the
trypsin protease-like domains, 133 (54%) were multidomain polypeptides, where 15 different domain architectures were observed. The impact of some unique

domain combinations observed in prokaryotic trypsinlike proteins and their likely influence on the biological
functions of these proteins are discussed.
Trypsins with Protein-Protein Interaction Modules
Analysis of the domain combinations in the trypsin-like
proteins identified in the current study reveals the PDZ
domains as the most abundant domain partners and their
tethering to the C-terminal of the trypsin-like domain. Of
the 133 multi-domain trypsin-like proteins identified,
112 were found to have either one (63 of 112) or two (49
of 112) PDZ domains tethered to the C-terminus of the
trypsin-like domain (Table 3). PDZ domains are one of
the most common protein-protein interaction domains
found in diverse organisms from bacteria to humans.
They play a major role in the assembly of the multimeric
protein complexes involved in cellular signaling and trafficking. This functional role for the PDZ domains is facilitated by their ability to recognise and bind short specific
motifs located in the C-termini of the target proteins and/
or to the internal peptide sequences, which enables them
to recognise and bind to diverse ligands. They modulate
the function and the localisation of their associated proteins and are involved in substrate recognition and binding in certain proteases [70-72]. S1-PDZ couple was the
only domain combination identified in the four of six
archaeal genomes where trypsin-like proteins were identified, suggesting that the additional PDZ domain was
recruited later in evolution, possibly in response to the
need for bacterial trypsin homologues to be recruited for
diverse functions. Other protein interaction modules were
also found associated with trypsin-like proteins in
prokaryotes. PPC module was found associated with
trypsin homologues (YP_434226.1, YP_437990.1 respectively) in Hahella chejuensis (Table 3; Additional file 1).
PPC is distantly related with PKD module (see below) and
is believed to mediate protein-protein and protein-carbohydrate interactions in secreted proteins [5,73]. Four FGGAP modules, important for ligand binding in certain
proteins [74], were found tethered to the C-terminus of
the trypsin protease domain in NP_825221.1 in Streptomyces avermitilis. ANF-receptor module corresponding to
the ligand binding region of several receptors [75] was
found associated with a trypsin homologue
(YP_073997.1) in Symbiobacterium thermophilum [5]
(Table 3; Additional file 1).
Trypsins with Modules Associated with Pathogenesis and
Cell Recognition
Many trypsin homologues identified in the present analysis reveal their association with modules that function in
cellular recognition and pathogenesis (Table 3; Additional file 1) clearly suggesting the biological role of such
trypsin domains in host pathogenesis. For instance, eight
trypsin homologues were found associated with

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/549

Colicin_V domain, N-terminal to the protease domain
(Table 3; Additional file 1). Colicin_V domain kills target
cells by disrupting their membrane potential [76] and
may assist pathogenesis and/or defense. Interestingly, all
eight Colicin_V domain containing trypsin-like proteins
identified in the present study were found in Gram-positive bacteria of actinobacteria lineage (Table 1; Additional
file 1). Perhaps, such domain combinations are required
for bacteria that live in harsh conditions since several of
them are soil bacteria and may have disseminated to these
species via multiple horizontal gene transfer events.
NP_344916.1, carrying CW_binding_1 repeat, was identified in Streptococcus pneumoniae. This repeat is believed to
be important in mediating recognition of choline-containing cell walls [77] (Table 3; Additional file 1).
Trypsins with modules associated with signalling and
metabolism
Some trypsin homologues were found associated with
regions most similar to modules likely to function in signalling and metabolism (Table 3; Additional file 1).
Trypsin homologue YP_434226.1 (see above) was also
found associated with an SCP domain (C-terminal to
trypsin and PPC domains) likely to have a calcium chelating function and is involved in many signalling processes
[73]. NP_811686.1 from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron is
associated with two FHA (forkhead-associated) domains
N-terminal to the protease domain, FHA domain which is
found in diverse proteins associated with metabolic processes such as DNA repair, signalling, transport etc [78].
NP_822175.1 in Streptomyces avermitilis was associated
with a CBM_5_12 module C-terminal to the protease
domain; these are presumed to have a carbohydrate-binding function. YP_273108.1 in Pseudomonas syringae was
associated with TerD module N-terminal to the protease
domain; this domain, found in tellurite resistance proteins, is required for growth in toxic medium. This is not
functionally
characterised
to
our
knowledge.
NP_604177.1 in Fusobacterium nucleatum carries an
Endonuclease_NS domain, which encodes an endonuclease that acts on double and single-stranded nucleic acids
[5] (Table 3; Additional file 1).
Co-Existing Domains that likely Modulate the Trypsin
Protease Domain
Trypsin homologues (NP_822175.1 and NP_827729.1)
from Streptomyces avermitilis were associated with Alpha
lytic protease prodomain (Pro_Al_prot), usually associated with Alpha-lytic endopeptidases – a subset of
trypsins involved in lysing and degrading soil organisms
(Table 3; Additional file 1). It is required for the correct
folding of the adjacent protease domain and acts as an
inhibitor of the mature enzyme when attached to the protease domain [79].

Other Domains associated with the Trypsin Homologues
in Prokaryotes
Modules of indeterminate function were also found associated with some trypsin-like proteins. For example
YP_374752.1 from Pelodictyon luteolum was found associated with six Sel1 repeats that were originally identified in
a negative regulator of Notch signalling pathway in Caenorahbditis elegans [80]. However, their functions in mammalian species are unknown and the absence of the
components of the Notch signalling pathway in prokaryotes suggests their involvement in some other physiological processes.
Domain Architectures in the Subtilisin (S8) Family
Subtilisins were found to be the most versatile of the five
serine protease families. 85 out of 227 (37%) proteins
with subtilisin-like domains were identified as multidomain polypeptides and a total of 38 different domain
combinations were discerned, many of which are specific
to bacteria or unique to certain prokaryotic species (Table
3).
Subtilisins with Protein-Protein Interaction Modules
Several subtilisins identified in the present study reveal
their association with domains that contain regions facilitating protein-protein interactions (Table 3; Additional
file 1). Subtilisin-like proteins containing one (nine gene
products; such as YP_154554.1 in Idiomarina loihiensis) or
two (four gene products; such as YP_341139.1 in Pseudoaltermonas haloplanktis) PPC domains C-terminal to the
protease domain were identified in different prokaryotic
lineages. While the single PPC-domain containing subtilisin-like proteins were identified only in archaea and
Gram-negative bacteria (except NP_051605.1 in Deinococcus radiodurans, which represents an intermediate between
Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria), subtilisinlike proteins with two PPC domains were identified in
both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as
archaea (Tables 1, 3; Additional file 1). Twelve gene products (such as NP_391688.1 in Bacillus subtilis) were identified that carry PA domain inserts in the subtilisin
protease domain. PA domain is suggested to form a lidlike structure that covers the active site in the protease and
is believed to be involved in protein interactions or mediate substrate recognition by proteases [81]. Subtilisin-like
proteins (such as YP_326498.1 in Natromonas pharaonis)
associated with PKD domain were also identified. PKD
domains are predicted to be involved in protein-protein
and protein-carbohydrate interactions [82] (Table 3;
Additional file 1).
Subtilisins with Modules associated with Pathogenesis and
Cell Recognition
Several subtilisin-like proteins identified here were found
in association with modules that function in cellular rec-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/549

ognition and pathogenesis (Table 3; Additional file 1).
For instance, 15 subtilisin-like proteins (such as
YP_260308.1 in Pseudomonas fluorescens) were identifiedthat carry an Autotransporter beta-domain, C-terminal to
the subtilisin domain (Table 3; Additional file 1). This
module encodes for a β-barrel domain that usually occurs
at the C-terminus of the various domains which it translocates across the outer membrane of the Gram-negative
bacteria, sometimes followed by an autocatalytic cleavage
of the passenger domain. They are often associated with
virulence functions such as cell adhesion and invasion
[83]. Interestingly, a subtilisin-like protein associated
with an autotransporter module NP_602747.1 was identified in a Gram-positive bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum (Tables 1, 3; Additional file 1). Subtilisin-like proteins
with Gram_pos_anchor modules, which helps to gain
access to host cells were identified (NP_241562.1 in Bacillus halodurans). NP_689039.1 in Sterptococcus agalacticae
additionally carries a closely related motif called YSIRK
type signal peptide [5]. Dockerin I type repeats, which are
critical components of cellulosome, that degrades crystalline cellulose [84], were found associated with the subtilisin domain in NP_280653.1 from Halobacterium.
Cleaved_Adhesin domain found in hemagglutinins and
peptidases that in Porphyromonas form components of
extracellular virulence complex RgpA-Kgp [85] was associated with a subtilisin-like protein YP_074547.1 in Symbiobacterium thermophilum. Big_2 domain possibly associated
with cell adhesion in bacteria was found encoded by subtilisin-like protein NP_969490.1 in the predatory bacterium Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus where it is likely to be
associated with the hydrolytic machinery that facilitates
the bacterium's predatory lifecycle [40] and in
NP_624131.1 in Thermoanaerobacter tengcongenesis, which
also carries a pair of SLH domains believed to anchor the
peptidoglycans [86]. Some other domains associated with
cell adhesion were also identified in some subtilisin-like
proteins such as HemolysinCabind, which is probably
involved in calcium mediated binding to the specific
receptors and in the folding of the protein subsequent to
the transmemembrane translocation [87] (NP_747027.1
in Pseudomonas putida; NP_927988.1 in Photorhabdus luminescens); CARDB-cell adhesion related bacterial domain
(NP_954260.1 in Geobacter sulfurreducens) [5]; Fibronectin type III (fn3) domain involved in cell surface binding
[88] (YP_446403.1 in Salinibacter ruber) (Table 3; Additional file 1).
Subtilisins with Modules associated with Signalling and
Metabolism
Many subtilisin-like proteins were identified with the
regions most similar to the modules likely to function in
signalling and metabolism flanking the protease domain
(Table 3; Additional file 1). NP_616940.1 gene product in
Methanosarcina acetovirans (archaea) carries a NosD mod-

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:549

ule C-terminal to the subtilisin domain; NosD is a periplasmic protein believed to insert copper into exported
reductase apoenzyme [89]. NP_965819.1, a gene product
in Lactobacillus johnsonii, encodes a multi-domain protein
with five FIVAR modules, a putative sugar binding
domain mostly found in cell-wall associated proteins [5].
NP_967057.1 in Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus was found to
carry a CUB domain, an extracellular module associated
with diverse functions in development and signalling in
eukaryotes, however, its role in prokaryotes is not clear
[90] (Table 3; Additional file 1).
Co-existing Domains that likely Modulate the Subtilisin
Domain
Some subtilisin-like proteins were found associated with
the domains that likely modulate the function of the adjacent subtlisin protease domain (Table 3; Additional file
1). A subtilisin-coexisting domain, that occurs N-terminal
to many subtilisins including those in plants [23] and is
subsequently cleaved prior to activation, was found in
several subtilisin-like proteins identified in the present
study (such as NP_241550.1 in Bacillus halodurans).
NP_967370.1 gene product in Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus
codes for a Proprotein convertase P-domain C-terminal to
the subtilisin domain. It is associated with the kex2/subtilisin endopeptidases in eukaryotes, gammaproteobacteria and few others and is believed to be necessary for the
folding and maintenance of the subtilisin domain and
regulating its calcium pH specificity [91]. NP_394205.1 in
Thermoplasma acidophilum (archaea) encodes for a thermopsin module, N-terminal to the subtilisin domain,
similar to those found in the thermostable acid proteases
in archaebacteria [5] (Table 3; Additional file 1).
Other Domains associated with the Subtilisin Homologues
in Prokaryotes
Several modules of unknown or indeterminate function
were also found associated with subtilisin-like proteins in
prokaryotes (Table 3; Additional file 1). These include
GRP module (similar to those in stress-upregulated glycine-rich proteins) in NP_435320.1 in Sinirhizobium
meliloti; Domain of Unknown Function DUF1034, also
associated with some plant subtilisins [23] seen in
YP_194362.1 in Lactobacillus acidophilus; DUF11 (believed
to be involved in porin formation) in NP_951948.1 in
Geobacter sulfurreducens; BNR repeats in NP_824495.1 in
Streptomyces avermitilis; PilZ domain in NP_969350.1 in
Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus; Tryptophan rich (W_rich_C)
domain in YP_382882.1 in Synechococcus [5] and so on
(Table 3; Additional file 1).
Domain Architectures in DD-peptidase (S12) Family
DD-peptidase-like proteins were found to be extremely
rigid in terms of domain combinations. Only five of 254
proteins carrying DD-peptidase-like domains were identi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/549

fied as multi-domain polypeptides, in sharp contrast to
other serine protease families analysed here, except Clp
proteases (Table 3; Additional file 1). These exceptional
prokaryotic DD-peptidase multi-domain architectures are
discussed here. DD-peptidase-like protein YP_434618.1
in Hahella chejuensis was found to encode a region most
similar to ABC transporters that function in translocation
of diverse compounds across biological membranes [92].
Another homologue NP_824819.1 in Streptomyces avermitilis carries three each of Condensation (associated with
enzymes that synthesise peptide antibiotics [93]), AMPbinding (associated with enzymes that act via ATPdependent AMP binding) and PP-binding (prosthetic
group of acyl carrier proteins) modules N-terminal to the
predicted DD-peptidase domain. Two DD-peptidase-like
proteins identified in the Gram-negative bacteria (Chlorobi), NP_811352.1 (Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron) and
YP_444518.1 (Salinibacter ruber) were found associated
with the Glyco_hydro_3 module found in the O-Glycosyl
hydrolases that hydrolyse the glycosidic bond between
two or more carbohydrates. YP_444518.1 also carries a
Glyco_hydro_3_C module, often found in association
with Glyco_hydro_3 and is involved in catalysis and binding β-glucan [5,94] (Table 3; Additional file 1).
Domain Architectures in Clp Protease (S14) Family
Clp proteases show an overwhelming preference for existence as single domain polypeptides. Only three of 121
Clp protease homologues identified in the current study
were found to carry additional domains (Table 3; Additional file 1). All three multi-domain Clp homologues
NP_148417.1 (Aeropyrum pernix), NP_126341.1 (Pyrococcus abyssi) and NP_579262.1 (Pyrococcus furiosus) were
identified in hyperthermophilic archaea and are associated with NfeD-like module C-terminal to the protease
domain (Table 3; Additional file 1). NfeD-like domain
corresponds to a family of proteins that include nodulation efficiency proteins and protease homologues.
Although exact function of this family remains unknown,
it is unlikely to be involved specifically in nodulation [5]
(Table 3; Additional file 1). The lack of multi-domain
polypeptides amongst Clp protease homologues can be
viewed in terms of their known functional associations.
Clp proteases are known to extensively form complexes
with AAA+ (ATPases Associated with diverse cellular
Activities) modules, which are one of the most diverse and
promiscuous modules known to associate with diverse
domains and function in a wide range of physiological
processes [95,96]. By extension, the association of Clp
protease domains with AAA+ mediated assemblies of protein complexes would allow them to modulate a host of
cellular and physiological processes where AAA+ modules
are required and would facilitate the availability of diverse
substrates for degradation by Clp protease domain. Therefore, it would seem that Clp proteases may rely on form-

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:549

ing complexes with AAA+ modules to ensure their
association with diverse processes.
Domain Architectures in Lon Protease (S16) Family
Lon proteases display a marked preference for existence as
multi-domain polypeptides. Of the 117 Lon protease-like
proteins identified here, 78 (67%) gene products were
found to retain co-existing domains and display a conserved domain architecture (Table 3; Additional file 1).
Fifty eight of the 117 Lon protease-like proteins were
found to possess the canonical Lon protease domain combination, consisting of an N-terminal domain (LON), a
central ATPase domain (AAA+ module) and a C-terminal
proteolytic domain (Lon_C). The N-terminal LON
domain, together with the AAA (ATPase) module, selectively interacts with the target protein and is believed to
impart substrate specificity to the Lon proteases [64]. A
significant repertoire was found associated with the
Sigma54_activat module that has ATPase activity and
interacts with the sigma-54 factor involved in the bacterial
RNA polymerase mediated transcription initiation [97]. It
is likely that the adjacent Lon protease domain may be
involved in processing the Sigma54_activat domain. Two
predominant architectures were observed for the
Sigma54_activat associated Lon protease homologues:
Sigma54_activat-S16 architectures found only in the
archaeal proteins such as NP_127256.1 (Pyrococcus abyssi)
and the Sigma54_activat-AAA-S16 in gene products such
as YP_183677.1 (Thermococcus kodakaraensis) (Table 3;
Additional file 1). The Magnesium chelatase, subunit ChlI
domain, which is involved in synthesis of the bacteriochlorophyll [98] was found associated with five archaeal
Lon protease-like proteins, where it occurs N-terminal to
the Lon protease domain (such as NP_248420.1 (Methanococcus jannaschii). An archaeal Lon protease-like protein NP_578196.1 (Pyrococcus furiosus) carries a
Magnesium chelatase and a Sigma54_activat domain Nterminal to the predicted Lon protease domain (Table 3;
Additional file 1). Interestingly, all the Mg_chelatase
domain containing Lon protease-like proteins are
assigned as the putative members of the LonB subfamily
of Lon proteases based on the sequence and phylogenetic
analysis (Figure 5; Additional file 1), suggesting a specific
acquisition of the Mg_chelatase module by some archaeal
proteases belonging the LonB subfamily. A Lon proteaselike protein YP_160730.1 from Azoarcus was found associated with the DnaB helicase C-terminal domain that
unwinds the DNA duplex in the prokaryotes. The domain
contains an ATP-binding site and is a likely site for ATP
hydrolysis [5]. Its co-occurrence with the Lon protease
domain suggests a putative alternate mechanism for facilitating
ATP-dependent
Lon
protease
activity.
NP_389388.1 in Bacillus subtilis was found associated with
a PDZ domain (see above) N-terminal to Lon protease
domain, which may facilitate interactions with specific
substrates (Table 3; Additional file 1).

Conclusion
Genome-wide studies reveal a large number of serine proteases belonging to the trypsin, subtilisin, DD-peptidase,
Clp protease and Lon protease families in prokaryotes.
However, there is only a limited knowledge available
about their probable biological functions. Trypsins, subtilisins and the DD-peptidases have a higher number of
representatives than the Clp protease and the Lon protease families in the genomes considered for the present
analysis. The differences in the representations of the five
serine protease families probably arose due to the selection of specific classes of serine proteases during evolution
as an adaptation to different cellular and extracellular
environments. For instance, the high abundance of the
trypsins and the subtilisins in Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus is
likely due to their involvement as the components of the
hydrolytic arsenal deployed for pathogenesis by the bacterium. Similarly, the abundance of the DD-peptidase-like
proteins in some pathogenic bacteria (such as Streptomyces
avermitilis) suggests their probable functions as virulence
factors and in antibiotic resistance. Interestingly, while
trypsins are also well represented in the eukaryotes, subtilisins (with the exception of plants) and DD-peptidases
are less abundant in higher organisms suggesting that
such enzymes were likely lost during the evolution as an
adaptation to the cellular (and the extracellular) environment in the eukaryotes. Phylogenetic analysis suggests
putative lateral transfer of serine protease genes between
different bacterial and archaeal species and also between
some bacteria and archaea. It is likely that some serine
protease-like proteins may have been disseminated in the
different prokaryotic species through probable horizontal
gene transfer events. The lateral transfer of the serine protease genes in bacteria may possibly confer an evolutionary advantage on the recipient [99].
In the absence of the experimental characterisation for the
most of the proteins sequences, an approximation of their
biological functions is often inferred based on their
sequence similarities to the proteins of known function.
Studies have shown that the overall biological functions
and the interactions of the multi-domain proteins are
conserved by the retention of the domain composition
and sequential arrangement [100]. Therefore the domain
architectures of the multi-domain serine protease-like
proteins were investigated to obtain insights into their
probable functional associations. A differential distribution of the multi-domain proteins across the five families
indicates different selection pressures and possible functional associations. Enzymatic and non-enzymatic
domains such as those associated with protein interaction, signaling, pathogenesis, cell adhesion, metabolism
etc were found tethered to the serine protease domain.
Addition of new domains would permit these enzymes to
acquire new functions and specificities contributing to the
functional diversities of these gene families. However, a

lack of significant repertoire of accessory domains does
not necessarily indicate lack of functional diversity.
Enzyme families may adopt alternative mechanisms to
expand their functional repertoire, such as associating
with limited but functionally diverse modules and other
proteins or effecting changes in key amino acid residues.
For instance, the Clp proteases form extensive complexes
with the functionally diverse AAA+ modules that would
enable them to modulate various physiological processes.
The presence of multiple copies of the same accessory
domain (that probably arose due to internal tandem
duplication or equivalent events) in many serine proteaselike proteins is another likely approach to expand their
functional repertoire. Some domain combinations (such
as S1-PDZ; LON-AAA-S16 etc.) were found to be widespread and conserved in prokaryotes suggesting a critical
roles. Unique domain combinations of some prokaryotic
serine protease-like proteins suggest their involvement in
species-specific functions. Several domain architectures
identified in prokaryotic serine proteases in the present
analysis are very different from those reported in eukaryotic serine proteases. This highlights the distinct biological
roles for the prokaryotic serine proteases compared to
those in the eukaryotes. Some of these prokaryotic serine
protease-like proteins with atypical domain combinations
are attractive targets for experimental characterisation.
Some pathogen peptidases identified in the present analysis with no identifiable homologues (unique domain
architectures) in their hosts may be promising drug targets
[99]. For example, a putative trypsin NP_344916.1 (TrypCW_binding-CW_binding) and a subtilisin-like protein
NP_345151.1
(Sub_N-Subt-PA-DUF1034Gram_pos_anchor) in Streptococcus pneumoniae, a human
pathogen, are postulated to function in pathogenesis
based on the domains associated with the serine protease
domain. Some serine protease-like proteins such as
NP_967057.1 (CUB domain) in Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus
and YP_374752.1 in Pelodictyon luteolum (Sel1 repeats) are
associated with domains similar to eukaryotic signalling
modules with no known functions in prokaryotes. A systematic deletion of the one or more co-existing domains
in the gene products with atypical domain combinations
and the resulting phenotypes may help understand their
roles in pathogenesis and other prokaryotic physiological
processes and the role of the co-existing domains in modulating the functions of these serine proteases. Similarly, a
phylogenetic cluster of the trypsin-like proteins (such as
NP_302493.1 in Mycobacterium leprae) that contain a
Colicin_V domain known to function in pathogenesis,
tethered C-terminal to the protease domain, suggests an
acquisition of the unique patterns in the interface region
of the trypsin domain in these gene products. Identification of the conserved domain-domain interface regions
and mutagenesis may help understand the function of
these gene products and the role of the interactions
between the adjacent domains.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/549

The systematic analysis of the five serine protease families
in the representative prokaryotic genomes is expected to
enable a better understanding of the previously uncharacterised serine proteases encoded in the various genomes.
The numbers of the serine protease-like proteins is likely
to increase with the increasing amounts of the prokaryotic
genomic data and the present analysis should help provide paradigms that would be useful in extending such
analyses to a broader repertoire of the prokaryotes. The
diversity of the functional domains co-existing with the
protease domain in the serine protease-like proteins has
provided clues to their biological functions, much of
which are yet to be characterised experimentally. Experimental characterisation of some of these gene products as
proposed here may help uncover the specific functional
roles for the serine proteases in various cellular and physiological processes and help understand their influence
on growth and development in the prokaryotic species.
