Abstract
Background: Lineage-specific genes, the genes that are restricted to a limited subset of related
organisms, may be important in adaptation. In parasitic organisms, lineage-specific gene products
are possible targets for vaccine development or therapeutics when these genes are absent from
the host genome.
Results: In this study, we utilized comparative approaches based on a phylogenetic framework to
characterize lineage-specific genes in the parasitic protozoan phylum Apicomplexa. Genes from
species in two major apicomplexan genera, Plasmodium and Theileria, were categorized into six
levels of lineage specificity based on a nine-species phylogeny. In both genera, lineage-specific genes
tend to have a higher level of sequence divergence among sister species. In addition, species-specific
genes possess a strong codon usage bias compared to other genes in the genome. We found that
a large number of genus- or species-specific genes are putative surface antigens that may be
involved in host-parasite interactions. Interestingly, the two parasite lineages exhibit several
notable differences. In Plasmodium, the (G + C) content at the third codon position increases with
lineage specificity while Theileria shows the opposite trend. Surface antigens in Plasmodium are
species-specific and mainly located in sub-telomeric regions. In contrast, surface antigens in Theileria
are conserved at the genus level and distributed across the entire lengths of chromosomes.
Conclusion: Our results provide further support for the model that gene duplication followed by
rapid divergence is a major mechanism for generating lineage-specific genes. The result that many
lineage-specific genes are putative surface antigens supports the hypothesis that lineage-specific
genes could be important in parasite adaptation. The contrasting properties between the lineagespecific genes in two major apicomplexan genera indicate that the mechanisms of generating
lineage-specific genes and the subsequent evolutionary fates can differ between related parasite
lineages. Future studies that focus on improving functional annotation of parasite genomes and
collection of genetic variation data at within- and between-species levels will be important in
facilitating our understanding of parasite adaptation and natural selection.

Background
Comparative genomics has revealed pronounced differ-

ences in gene content across species [1]. In an early analysis of eight microbial genomes, 20–56% of the genes in a

genome were shown to not have high similarity to any
sequence in public databases [2]. Initially these genes
were referred to as orphan genes, or ORFans, because they
correspond to stretches of open reading frame in bacterial
genomes that have no known relationship to other
sequences. As more eukaryote genome sequences become
available, the term 'lineage-specific gene' is gaining in
popularity because one can specify the 'lineage specificity'
of a gene to describe its phylogenetic distribution [3].
Newly evolved genes may be important for adaptation
and generation of diversity [4]. For example, the protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium parvum possesses a set of
nucleotide salvage genes that are unique among all apicomplexans surveyed to date [5]. Acquisition of the nucleotide salvage pathway from a proteobacterial source as
well as other sources apparently facilitated loss of genes
involved in de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis, rendering
this parasite entirely dependent on the host for both its
purines and pyrimidines. Characterization of these lineage-specific genes not only leads to a better understanding
of the parasite's biology but also provides a promising
therapeutic target against an important parasite, since
blocking the nucleotide salvage pathway can inhibit parasite growth but not harm its human host [5].
Currently, there are several hypotheses regarding the origin of lineage-specific genes. The first model invokes the
process of horizontal gene transfer, in which organisms
acquire genes from other distantly related species. This
mechanism can create lineage-specific genes that are not
shared by closely related organisms, as in the example of
nucleotide salvage enzymes in C. parvum [5]. Previous
studies have shown that horizontal gene transfer is an
important force for genome evolution in bacteria [6-8],
unicellular eukaryotes [9], and multicellular eukaryotes
[10].
The second model is based on gene duplication followed
by rapid sequence divergence [11,12]. Based on the observation that the sequence divergence rate is positively correlated with lineage specificity in a diverse set of
organisms [3,11-14], Alba and Castresana [12] proposed
that newly duplicated genes may be released from selective constraint and accumulate mutations at a faster rate.
While most of the mutations may be deleterious and lead
to loss of function in one copy [15], it is also possible that
one of the copies can acquire new functions and become
a novel gene in the genome. However, whether gene
duplication followed by rapid divergence is truly an
important mechanism of generating lineage-specific genes
is still under debate. Elhaik et al. [16] suggested that the
correlation between divergence rate and lineage specificity
may simply be an artifact, stemming from our inability to
identify homologs of fast-evolving genes across distantly

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/108

related taxa based on sequence similarity searches. However, a recent simulation study by Alba and Castresana
[17] demonstrated that sequence similarity searches performed at the amino acid level can reliably detect fastevolving genes due to the rate heterogeneity among sites.
In addition to the two main models discussed above,
other explanations for the origin of lineage-specific genes
such as de novo creation from non-coding sequences
[18,19], exon-shuffling [20,21], intracellular gene transfer
between organellar and nuclear genomes [9], and differential gene loss [22] also have been proposed. However,
the relative importance of various forces that generate lineage-specific genes remains largely unknown.
While erroneous annotation has also been proposed as
one explanation for the abundance of lineage-specific
genes [23,24], expression data [25,26] and nucleotide
substitution patterns [24,27] suggest that many lineagespecific genes are indeed functional and not annotation
artifacts. Unfortunately, understanding the biological
function of these genes is difficult due to the lack of
homologs in model organisms to use for functional characterization. As a result, a large percentage of the lineagespecific genes that have been identified to date are annotated as hypothetical proteins of unknown function.
In this study, we aim to characterize the lineage-specific
genes in a group of unicellular eukaryotes from the phylum Apicomplexa, including several important pathogens
of humans and animals. The most infamous member of
this phylum is the causative agent of malaria, Plasmodium,
which causes more than one million human deaths per
year globally [28]. Other important lineages include
Cryptosporidium that causes cryptosporidiosis in humans
and animals [29,30], Theileria that causes tropical theileriosis and East Coast fever in cattle [31,32], and Toxoplasma
that causes toxoplasmosis in immunocompromised
patients and congenitally infected fetuses [33]. The availability of genome sequences from these apicomplexan
species has provided us with new and exciting opportunities to study their genome evolution. Improved knowledge of the lineage-specific genes in these important
parasites can lead to a better understanding of their adaptation history and possibly identification of novel therapeutic targets.

Results
Inference of the species tree
We based our comparative analyses on a phylogenetic
framework in order to infer the lineage specificity of individual genes. Among the nine species included in the data
set (seven apicomplexans as well as two outgroup ciliates), we identified 83 single-copy genes that contain at
least 100 alignable amino acid sites to infer the species

tree (see Methods for details; a list of these 83 genes is provided in Additional file 1). Based on the concatenated
alignment of these 83 genes (with 24,494 aligned amino
acids sites), we infer a species tree with strong bootstrap
support (Figure 1). This tree is consistent with our prior
understanding of apicomplexan relationships based on
morphology and development [34], rDNA analyses
[35,36], and multigene phylogenies [37,38].
Phylogenetic distribution of orthologous genes
Using the species tree (Figure 1) as the foundation, we
characterized the phylogenetic distribution of orthologous gene clusters among the apicomplexan genomes
analyzed (Figure 2, Table 1). The orthologous gene identification was performed using OrthoMCL [39] based on
sequence similarity searches with an additional step of
Markov Clustering [40] to improve sensitivity and specificity (see Methods for details). Our results indicated that
many genes are genus-specific, ranging from approximately 30% of the genes in Plasmodium and Theileria up to
about 45% in Cryptosporidium.

We selected Plasmodium falciparum and Theileria annulata
for further investigations of lineage-specific genes. The
asymmetrical topology of the species tree allows categorization of the genes in these two species into six levels of
lineage specificity (Figure 2), yielding the highest resolution in determining the lineage specificity of a gene. The
least specific genes at level 1, denoted as Pf1 for those in
the P. falciparum genome and Ta1 for those in the T. annulata genome, are shared by all nine species analyzed,
including two free-living ciliates; the most specific genes
at level 6, denoted as Pf6 for those in the P. falciparum
genome and Ta6 for those in the T. annulata genome, are

Phylogenetic distribution of orthologous gene clusters
Phylogenetic distribution of orthologous gene clusters. The numbers after species name abbreviation (see
Table 1) indicate the total number of annotated protein coding genes in the genome. The numbers above a branch and
proceeded by a '+' sign indicate the number of orthologous
gene clusters that are uniquely present in all daughter lineages; the numbers below a branch and proceeded by a '-' sign
indicate the number of orthologous gene clusters that are
uniquely absent. For example, on the internal branch that
leads to the two Plasmodium species, 1,645 gene clusters contain sequences from both Pf and Pv but not any other species
present on the tree. Similarly, there are 22 gene clusters that
contain sequences from all species except Pf and Pv. Note
that a gene cluster may contain more than one sequence
from a species if paralogs are present in the genome. The levels refer to the degree of lineage specificity; genes in level 1
are shared by all species on the tree and genes in level 6 are
species-specific.

the properties of their species-specific genes. Finally,

have a higher level of completeness of genome assembly

determining the chromosomal location of the lineagespecific genes.
Sequence divergence
The two Plasmodium species, P. falciparum and P. vivax, differ greatly in their base composition. In the coding region,
P. falciparum has a (G + C) content of 24% while P. vivax
has a (G + C) content of 46%. Estimates of dN (the number
of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous
site) and dS (the number of synonymous substitutions per
synonymous site) are not reliable due to the extreme ATbias in the P. falciparum genome. The average dS calculated
from 4,159 P. falciparum-P. vivax sequence pairs is 45.7.
For this reason, we quantified sequence divergence at the
amino acid level based on the protein distance calculated
by TREE-PUZZLE [43]. We found that the level of
sequence divergence between sister taxa is positively cor-

related with the lineage specificity of a gene (Figure 3).
The same trend is observed in both species-pairs. Compared to the two Plasmodium species, the Theileria speciespair has a lower level of sequence divergence. Level 6
genes are not included in the sequence divergence result
because they are species-specific and have no orthologous
sequence in the sister species for comparison.
We identified 1,701 genes that are single copy in both
Theileria species and are reasonably conserved for substitution rate analysis at the nucleotide level (i.e., dS <= 1).
Consistent with the sequence divergence measured at the
amino acid level, nucleotide substitution rates are higher
in genes with higher lineage specificity (Table 2). We do
not find strong evidence of any gene under positive selection (i.e., dN/dS ratio > 1, data not shown).
(G + C) content and relative codon bias
The average (G + C) content at the third codon position
(i.e., (G+C3)) increases with lineage specificity in P. falciparum (Figure 4), suggesting that phylogenetically conserved genes are biased toward AT-rich codons in this
extremely AT-rich genome. In T. annulata, the opposite
trend is observed; genes with high lineage specificity have
a lower (G + C) content at the third codon position (Figure 4).

Level of amino acid sequence divergence. The five categories on the X-axis refer to the level of lineage specificity
defined in Figure 2. Level 6 genes are not included because
they are species-specific and have no orthologous sequence
for comparison. Error bars indicate standard errors.

We used the relative codon bias developed by Karlin et al.
[44] to compare the differences in codon usage between
different gene sets within each species (Table 3). In both
P. falciparum and T. annulata, the level 6 (i.e., species-specific) genes exhibit a high level of deviation with regard of
their codon preference compared to the other gene sets
(see Methods for details). In P. falciparum, the average
pairwise difference in all comparisons is 0.049 and the
mean pairwise difference involving Pf6 genes is 0.102
(Table 3A). In T. annulata, the average pairwise difference
in all comparison is 0.098 and the mean pairwise difference involving Ta6 genes is 0.183 (Table 3B).

Genes that are not single-copy or have a high level of divergence (i.e., dS > 1) are excluded because the substitution rate estimates are not reliable.
Level 6 genes are not included because they are species-specific and have no orthologous sequence for comparison. The nonsynonymous
substitution rate (dN) indicates the number of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site; the synonymous substitution rate (dS)
indicates the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site.

Functional analyses based on annotation
As expected, most of the phylogenetically conserved genes
have functional annotation or have at least one identifiable protein domain (Table 4). As the phylogenetic distribution of a gene becomes more restricted, it is more likely
to be annotated as a hypothetical protein. Functional
analysis based on available gene annotation indicates that
most conserved genes (levels 1 and 2) are responsible for
basic cellular processes (e.g., DNA replication, transcription, translation, etc), while most genus- and species-specific genes (levels 5 and 6) are hypothetical proteins of
unknown function (see Additional files 2 and 3). Despite
the poor annotation of genus- and species-specific genes,
87% of level 5 genes and 72% of level 6 genes in P. falciparum have expression data available based on oligonucleotide microarrays [26]. This result suggests that most of
the hypothetical proteins are real genes and not annotation artifacts.

parasites are likely to be involved in host-parasite interactions and thus, potentially adaptation.
Chromosomal location
Analysis of chromosomal location demonstrated that
most species-specific genes in P. falciparum are located
near chromosome ends (see Figure 5 for one example
chromosome and Additional file 4 for all 14 chromosomes). In T. annulata (see Figure 6 for one example chromosome and Additional file 5 for all four chromosomes),
we observed a similar pattern that the regions adjacent to
chromosome ends are devoid of the phylogenetically conserved genes (cf. Figures 5B and 6B). However, unlike the
pattern found in P. falciparum, most of the species-specific
genes in T. annulata (i.e., Ta6) are distributed across the
entire length of chromosomes and are not enriched in the
regions adjacent to chromosome ends (cf. Figures 5A and
6A).

The two focal lineages in our analysis, Plasmodium and
Theileria, exhibit one interesting difference in terms of the
phylogenetic distribution of surface antigens. We found
that surface antigens are species-specific in Plasmodium
and genus-specific in Theileria. All members of the three
large surface antigen protein families in P. falciparum
genome, including 161 rifin, 74 PfEMP1, and 35 stevor,
are found in the Pf6 list and have no ortholog in P. vivax.
Of the 163 T. annulata proteins that contain FAINT, a protein domain that associates with proteins exported to the
host cell [31], 116 are in the Ta5 list (i.e., shared by T.
annulata and T. parva) and only 28 are in the Ta6 list (i.e.,
specific to T. annulata).
In P. falciparum 41% of the genus-specific proteins and
62% of the species-specific proteins contain a putative signal peptide or at least one predicted transmembrane
domain (Table 4), which suggests that these proteins may
be exported to the host cell or present on the surface of the
parasite or its vacuole. This result is consistent with the
hypothesis that lineage-specific genes in apicomplexan

The relative codon bias between groups of genes was calculated
based on the method developed by Karlin et al. [44]. The gene sets
listed in columns are used as the reference and the gene sets listed in
rows are the focal set. A. Relative codon bias between sets of P.
falciparum genes. B. Relative codon bias between sets of T. annulata
genes.

To quantify the pattern of gene distribution on chromosomes, we calculated the distance of each gene to the nearest chromosome end. For each set of genes (levels 1
through 6 in each species), we utilized (1) the average distance to the nearest chromosome end and (2) the minimal distance to the nearest chromosome end (i.e., the
minimal found in a given gene set) for this analysis. In P.

falciparum, the average distance scales with chromosome
size and the species-specific genes (i.e., Pf6) are closer to
chromosome ends (Figure 7A). In contrast, minimal distance does not scale with chromosome size (Figure 7B).
For all chromosomes, the minimal distances of phylogenetically conserved genes from the chromosome ends
(i.e., Pf1 through Pf4) are larger than 50–100 kb. This
result indicates that the regions that are occupied exclusively by genus- and species-specific genes are proportionally larger in smaller chromosomes. Consistent with this
observation, three of the smallest chromosomes in P. falciparum (i.e., MAL1, MAL2, and MAL4) have many more
species-specific genes than random expectation (Chisquare test d.f. = (6 gene sets -1) * (14 chromosomes - 1)
= 65, P-value = 1e-12).
In T. annulata, genes with different levels of lineage specificity have similar average distances to chromosome ends
(Figure 7C). This result corroborates the visual pattern in
Figure 6A that species-specific genes are distributed across
the entire length of a chromosome, in contrast to the clustering near chromosome ends observed in P. falciparum
(Figure 5A). For all four chromosomes in T. annulata, the
regions that are adjacent to chromosome ends and devoid
of phylogenetically conserved genes (i.e., Ta1 through
Ta4) are approximately 20–40 kb (Figure 7D), a distance
smaller than in P. falciparum. Unlike the pattern found in
P. falciparum in which species-specific genes are closer to
chromosome ends than genus-specific genes, genus- and
species-specific genes in T. annulata (i.e., Ta5 and Ta6)
have similar minimal distances in all four chromosomes
(Figure 7D).
In both P. falciparum and T. annulata, genes located near
chromosome ends have a higher level of sequence divergence relative to its ortholog in the sister species at the

Gene sets from Pf1 through Pf6 refer to the orthologous gene clusters present in the six levels of lineage specificity defined in Figure 2. Pf6A is the
same as Pf6 except that it excludes three surface antigen gene families (i.e., PfEMP1, rifin, and stevor). Note that there may be more than one P.
falciparum gene in a gene cluster when paralogous genes are present in the genome.

amino acid level (Figure 8). This trend is observed in
genes with different levels of lineage specificity and is
stronger in T. annulata.

Discussion
We identified a pattern in which lineage-specific genes
have a higher level of sequence divergence among sister
species in a group of important protozoan parasites. This
result is consistent with previous studies in bacteria [13],
fungi [3], and animals [11,12,14]. Now we further confirm that this pattern also holds true in a protistan phylum, suggesting that it may be universal across much of
the tree-of-life. Results from functional analyses agree
with our intuitive expectation that conserved genes are
involved in basic cellular functionalities and are well
annotated. A large number of the lineage-specific genes
(at the species level in Plasmodium and the genus level in

Theileria) are found to be putative surface antigens that the
parasites use to interact with their hosts. This result supports the hypothesis that lineage-specific genes may be
important in adaptation [4]. In addition, the physical distance of a gene to the nearest chromosome end is correlated with the level of sequence divergence.
We found three contrasting properties of lineage-specific
genes between two major apicomplexan lineages. First,
families of surface antigens are species-specific in Plasmodium but genus-specific in Theileria. Second, most of the
species-specific genes are located in sub-telomeric regions
in P. falciparum but no such pattern exists in T. annulata.
Third, the (G + C) content at the third codon position
increases with lineage specificity in P. falciparum but
decreases in T. annulata. Taken together, these results suggest that the mechanisms of generating lineage-specific

genes and their subsequent evolutionary fates differ
between apicomplexan parasite lineages.
Gene content evolution
All apicomplexan species analyzed have small genomes
compared to the free-living out-group. This result is consistent with comparative genomic analyses conducted in
other pathogenic bacteria and eukaryotes; extreme
genome reduction is a common theme in the genome
evolution of these organisms [45].

A large proportion of the genes in apicomplexans are
genus-specific (Figure 2). One parsimonious explanation
for this observation is that each lineage acquired a new set
of genes during its evolutionary history. An alternative
explanation invokes differential loss among lineages
when evolving from a free-living ancestor with a relatively
large genome. We found that 23% of the protein coding
genes in P. falciparum and 16% in T. annulata have a complex phylogenetic distribution pattern and do not fit into
a simple single gain/loss model. These results suggest that
some ancestral genes in the apicomplexans may have
experienced multiple independent losses during their evolutionary history. Further investigation is necessary to distinguish true gene gains from differential retention of
ancestral genes.
Comparison of genes with different levels of lineage
specificity
Consistent with previous studies in bacteria [13], fungi
[3], and animals [11,12,14], we observed a pattern in
which sequence divergence is higher in genes with a
higher level of lineage specificity. One explanation is that
phylogenetically conserved genes are often involved in
fundamental cellular processes (see Results). These genes
are likely to be under purifying selection that constrains
the rate of sequence divergence. In support of this hypothesis, we observe that the mean dN/dS ratio among the level
1 genes in Theileria is only 0.07 (Table 2), indicating an
extremely low rate of nonsynonymous substitution relative to synonymous substitution.

Based on the hypothesis that lineage-specific genes are
often involved in adaptation [4], such as invasion of hosts
or evasion of the immune responses, lineage-specific
genes may be under positive selection and have a faster
rate of sequence divergence. Our data is suggestive in this
regard, as genus-specific genes exhibit higher sequence
divergence than genes with lower levels of lineage specificity. Unfortunately we cannot directly test the hypothesis
that lineage-specific genes are more likely to be under positive selection using the dN/dS ratio data. The level of
sequence divergence is too high in both species pairs for
such analysis. Practically all of the genes from the Plasmodium pair and approximately 1,000 genes from the Theile-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/108

ria pair (i.e., more than a quarter of the gene repertoire)
have a dS estimate that is larger than one. Under this high
level of sequence divergence, we cannot confidently estimate the substitution rate due to saturation. Better detection of positive selection in these genes requires data on
genetic variation at within- and between-species levels
[46,47].
Codon bias analyses indicate that species-specific genes
have a different codon preference compared to other
genes in the same genome, whereas the genes with lower
levels of lineage specificity are relatively similar to each
other (Table 3). It is possible that species-specific genes
are relatively young and have yet to adapt to the codon
usage pattern of the genome. Support for this hypothesis
provided by the observation that the (G + C) content at
the third codon position is much lower in the phylogenetically conserved genes in P. falciparum (Figure 4), suggesting that these 'older' genes are more biased toward GCpoor codons in this AT-rich genome. Alternatively, some
species-specific genes may be subject to a different pattern
of selection and thus possess different codon preference.
For the lineage-specific genes at the genus and species
level that have functional annotations, many are known
surface antigens. Because surface antigens are used by the
parasites to interact with their hosts [48], such as adhesion
to the cell surface or evasion of the host immune
response, this result supports the hypothesis that (at least
some) lineage-specific genes are involved in host-parasite
interactions and have facilitated lineage-specific adaptation. Interestingly, surface antigens are species-specific in
Plasmodium, but are genus-specific in Theileria. In addition, 62% of P. falciparum-specific genes contain a putative signal peptide or at least one predicted
transmembrane domain. This result is consistent with one
previous study that compared P. falciparum with three
other Plasmodium species that cause rodent malaria [49].
Of the 168 P. falciparum-specific genes identified in this
previous study that are not located in sub-telomeric
regions, 68% are predicted to be exported to the surface of
the parasites or the infected host cells.
Comparison between Plasmodium and Theileria
Previous studies suggest that the two focal species pairs
have similar divergence times. The two Plasmodium species
diverged about 80–100 million years ago [41] and the two
Theileria species diverged about 82 million years ago [42].
Our results indicate that sequence divergence is much
higher between the two Plasmodium species (Figures 1 and
3). This may be caused by the difference in nucleotide
composition, since P. falciparum has a GC content of 24%
while P. vivax has a GC content of 46% in the coding
region. Bias in nucleotide composition has been shown to
change codon usage and amino acid composition [50].

Page 11 of 16

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:108

Alternatively, it is also possible that the divergence time
between T. annulata and T. parva was overestimated
because it was based on a simplified assumption that the
synonymous substitution rate in Theileria is similar to that
in Plasmodium [42].
In both P. falciparum and T. annulata, the sub-telomeric
regions contain exclusively genus- or species-specific
genes. Interestingly, the physical size of these regions is
not correlated with chromosome size. This observation
indicates that these regions are proportionally larger in
smaller chromosomes and helps explains the pattern that
the three small chromosomes in P. falciparum have many
more species-specific genes than predicted by random
expectations (see Results). In addition, genes that are
located near a chromosome end have a higher level of
sequence divergence in both species, regardless of their
lineage specificity (Figure 8). The high evolutionary rates
in sub-telomeric regions are shared by many eukaryotic
lineages; high rates of inter-chromosomal recombination,
local duplication, and segmental rearrangement have
been reported in organisms including humans [51], yeasts
[52], and plants [53].
Given the high rates of evolution in sub-telomeric regions,
it may be advantageous for pathogens to have their surface antigen genes located in these evolutionary hotspots
to facilitate the generation of antigenic diversity. Consistent with this hypothesis, many micro-parasites have large
gene families that encode surface antigens in sub-telomeric regions (reviewed in [54]). The best-studied example
is the causative agent of African trypanosomiasis, Trypanosoma brucei. The vsg gene family in T. brucei encodes variant surface glycoproteins (VSG) that form a dense coat on
the outside of the parasite. In the bloodstream stage, T.
brucei sequentially expresses different members of the vsg
gene family, one at a time, to generate antigenic variation
[55]. The positioning of vsg genes in the genome is tightly
linked to regulation of expression; the actively expressed
vsg is duplicated into one of the bloodstream expression
sites located in the sub-telomeric regions (reviewed in
[56,57]). This homologous recombination process which
involves loci that are not positional alleles is hypothesized
to be important in generating genetic diversity within the
gene family [54]. Although the genes encoding surface
antigens in P. falciparum are not known to be duplicated
into specific expression sites as observed in T. brucei, the
clustering of these genes in sub-telomeric regions can
facilitate
inter-chromosomal
recombination
that
increases antigenic variation [58].
We found that most of the surface antigen genes in P. falciparum are located in sub-telomeric regions, as previously
noted [28]. Several studies have established the importance of genome location in the generation and mainte-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/108

nance of antigenic variation in P. falciparum [58,59]. The
surface antigen PfEMP1 possessed by P. falciparum is
exported to the cell surface of infected erythrocytes.
PfEMP1 can remove infected erythrocytes from blood circulation by cellular adherence to microvascular endothelial cells and avoid spleen-dependent killing [60]. The
study on genetic structuring suggested that the approximately 60 copies of var genes (which encode PfEMP1) in
the P. falciparum genome can be divided into three functionally diverged groups with two in sub-telomeric
regions and one close to the centers of chromosomes [59].
Furthermore, the recombination rate is found to be high
among members in the same functional group but low for
members belonging to different groups. This recombinational hierarchy may facilitate the generation of genetic
diversity within a group and promote specialization
between different groups. Experimental evidence suggests
that the clustering of var genes in the sub-telomeric
regions is important in the epigenetic regulation of gene
expression in P. falciparum [61,62].
Given the generality of association between surface antigen genes and sub-telomeric regions in micro-parasites, it
is interesting to see that T. annulata appears to be an
exception to this rule. This finding may provide an explanation for the difference in host range between the two
apicomplexan lineages. Because a large percentage of surface antigen genes in Plasmodium are located in sub-telomeric regions, the generation of antigenic variation may
be faster in Plasmodium than in Theileria. Our results indicate that gene families encoding surface antigens in Plasmodium are highly diverged between species within the
genus, whereas the two Theileria species still share most of
their surface antigens and the genes encoding them are
distributed across the entire lengths of chromosomes. For
this reason, Plasmodium may be able to adapt to new host
species at a faster rate, resulting in its much wider host
range compared to Theileria; Plasmodium spp. can infect
mammals, birds, and reptiles, whereas Theileria spp. are
limited to ruminants [34].

Conclusion
Our results agree with previous observations in other
organisms that lineage-specific genes have a higher level
of sequence divergence compared to phylogenetically
conserved genes. In addition, two major apicomplexan
lineages may have different mechanisms for generating or
retaining species-specific genes. Because many lineagespecific genes in these parasites are surface antigens that
interact with the host, future investigations on genome
evolution in these parasites may facilitate the identification of new therapeutic or vaccine targets. Future studies
that focus on improving functional annotation of parasite
genomes and the collection of genetic variation data at
different phylogenetic levels will be important in our

understanding of parasite adaptation and natural selection.

Methods
Data source and orthologous gene identification
The data sources of the annotated proteins are listed in
Table 1. Protein domain identification was performed
with HMMPFAM [63] (version 20.0). Transmembrane
domain prediction [28] and gene expression data [26] of
annotated Plasmodium falciparum genes were downloaded
from PlasmoDB [64] (Release 5.3).

Orthologous gene clusters were identified using
OrthoMCL [39] (version 1.3, April 10, 2006) with default
parameter settings. The ortholog identification process in
OrthoMCL is largely based on the popular criterion of
reciprocal best-hits but also involves an additional step of
Markov Clustering [40] to improve sensitivity and specificity. We used WU-BLAST [65] (version 2.0) for the allagainst-all BLASTP similarity search step with the e-value
cutoff set to 1e-15.
Phylogenetic inference
Based on the orthologous gene clustering result, we identified genes that are shared by all nine species to infer the
species tree. Orthologous gene clusters that contain more
than one gene from any given species were removed to
avoid the complications introduced by paralogous genes
in phylogenetic inference. Of the 768 orthologous gene
clusters that are shared by all nine species (Figure 2), 154
clusters were single-copy in all species. For each gene,
CLUSTALW [66] (version 1.83) was used for multiple
sequence alignment. We enabled the 'tossgaps' option to
ignore gaps when constructing the guide tree and used the
default settings for all other parameters. The alignments
produced by CLUSTALW were filtered by GBLOCKS [67]
(version 0.91b) to remove regions that contain gaps or are
highly divergent. Individual genes that had less than 100
aligned amino acid sites (33/154) or contained identical
sequences from different taxa (38/154) after GBLOCKS
filtering were eliminated from further analysis. We concatenated the alignments from the remaining 83 genes
(with a total of 24,494 aligned amino acid sites) and utilized PHYML [68] to infer the species tree based on the
maximum likelihood method. We used PHYML to estimate the proportion of invariable sites and the gamma
distribution parameter (with eight substitution categories). The substitution model was set to JTT [69] and we
enabled the optimization options for tree topology,
branch lengths, and rate parameters. To estimate the level
of support on each internal branch, we performed 100
non-parametric bootstrap samplings.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/108

Quantification of sequence divergence
The nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rates
at the nucleotide level (i.e., dN and dS) were estimated
using CODEML in the PAML package [70]. We performed
pairwise sequence alignment at the amino acid level using
CLUSTALW [66] with default parameters for all orthologous genes that are single copy in both Plasmodium species
or both Theileria species. The protein alignments were
converted into the corresponding nucleotide alignments
using NAL2PAL [71] (version 12). All gap positions were
removed from the alignments before the substitution rate
estimation by CODEML. To avoid problems of inaccurate
rate estimation caused by saturation, we excluded
sequences with a synonymous substitution rate (dS) that
is greater than one.

To quantify the level of sequence divergence at the amino
acid level, we used TREE-PUZZLE [43] to calculate the
protein distance between orthologs in sister species. The
parameters were set to the JTT substitution model [69],
mixed model of rate heterogeneity with one invariable
and eight Gamma rate categories, and the exact and slow
parameter estimation. Orthologous sequences were first
aligned using CLUSTALW [66] followed by a filtering step
using GBLOCKS [67] to remove gaps and highly divergent
regions before the calculation of protein distance. Five
sequences (PFA0650w, PFD0105c, PFL0060w, and
PFD1140w from P. falciparum and TA18345 from T. annulata) that were not reliably aligned to their ortholog in the
sister species were excluded from this analysis.
Calculation of relative codon bias
The relative codon bias between sets of genes in the two
focal species, P. falciparum and T. annulata, was calculated
based on the method developed by Karlin et al. [44].
Briefly, the method considers two sets of genes, one focal
set and one reference set, and calculates the difference in
relative frequency of codon family that encode the same
amino acid between the two sets. The theoretical maximum of the difference between two sets of genes is 2.000,
but the empirical values based on biological data generally range from 0.050 to 0.300 [44,72,73]. This measurement is different from the conventional codon adaptation
index (CAI) developed by Sharp and Li [74], in which a set
of highly expressed genes is always used as the reference
set. We choose the relative codon bias to measure codon
preference because it can provide a better resolution
under certain conditions. For example, two sets of weakly
expressed genes may have similar values of codon adaptation index but still possess vastly different codon preferences.
Visualization and quantification of chromosomal location
GBROWSE [75] was used for visualization of gene distribution on chromosomes. To quantify the pattern of chro-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:108

mosomal location, we calculated the distance of each
gene to the nearest chromosome end. For example, the P.
falciparum gene PF10_0023 on chromosome MAL10
(physical size is 1,694,445 bp) starts at position 99,380
and ends at 100,362. Its distance to the nearest chromosome end was calculated as 99,380 - 1 = 99,379 bp. For
gene PF10_0369 on the same chromosome that starts at
1,493,991 and ends at 1,496,955, its distance to the nearest chromosome end was calculated as 1,694,445 –
1,496,955 = 197,490 bp. The orientation of a gene (i.e.,
whether it is on the '+' strand or the '-' strand) is ignored
for distance calculation.
