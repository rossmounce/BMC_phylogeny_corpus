Background: Splice donor sites have a highly conserved GT or GC dinucleotide and an extended
intronic consensus sequence GTRAGT that reflects the sequence complementarity to the U1
snRNA. Here, we focus on unusual donor sites with the motif GYNGYN (Y stands for C or T; N
stands for A, C, G, or T).

Results: While only one GY functions as a splice donor for the majority of these splice sites in
human, we provide computational and experimental evidence that 110 (1.3%) allow alternative
splicing at both GY donors. The resulting splice forms differ in only three nucleotides, which results
mostly in the insertion/deletion of one amino acid. However, we also report the insertion of a stop
codon in four cases. Investigating what distinguishes alternatively from not alternatively spliced
GYNGYN donors, we found differences in the binding to U1 snRNA, a strong correlation between
U1 snRNA binding strength and the preferred donor, over-represented sequence motifs in the
adjacent introns, and a higher conservation of the exonic and intronic flanks between human and
mouse. Extending our genome-wide analysis to seven other eukaryotic species, we found
alternatively spliced GYNGYN donors in all species from mouse to Caenorhabditis elegans and even
in Arabidopsis thaliana. Experimental verification of a conserved GTAGTT donor of the STAT3 gene
in human and mouse reveals a remarkably similar ratio of alternatively spliced transcripts in both
species.

Conclusion: In contrast to alternative splicing in general, GYNGYN donors in addition to
NAGNAG acceptors enable subtle protein variations.

Given the rather limited number of human genes [1], alternative splicing is believed to be a major mechanism to bridge the

gap between the gene and protein number [2,3]. Most human
multi-exon genes express more than one splice variant [4].
Protein isoforms, produced by alternative splicing, can differ

in various aspects, including ligand binding affinity, signaling
activity, protein domain composition, subcellular localization, and protein half-life [5]. In coordination with nonsensemediated mRNA decay, alternatively spliced transcripts can
be degraded rapidly, providing a regulation and fine-tuning
mechanism of the adjustment of the protein level [6].
The skipping of an exon is the most frequent alternative splice
event, followed by alternative splice donor and acceptor sites
[7]. Such splice events often result in large effects for the proteins, for example, by deleting functional units like protein
domains [8,9] or transmembrane helices [10,11]. On the other
hand, alternative splicing also allows the production of many
very similar protein isoforms. The most frequent of these subtle events is the alternative splicing at NAGNAG or tandem
acceptors [12]. In the NAGNAG motif (N stands for A, C, G or
T/U; throughout the paper we write T instead of U also when
referring to an RNA sequence), we have termed the upstream
acceptor the E acceptor (since the downstream NAG becomes
exonic in case of splicing at this site) and the downstream one
the I acceptor (since the whole tandem becomes intronic).
This splice acceptor motif frequently allows the selection of
one of the two AGs in the splice process, resulting in the insertion/deletion (indel) of the I acceptor NAG in mRNAs, preferably if both Ns are either A, C, or T [13-15]. Despite the rather
simple genomic structure, these NAG indels lead to a surprisingly high diversity at the protein level. Depending on the
sequence of the up- and downstream exon and the phase of
the intron, eight different single amino acid indels, the
exchange of a dipeptide for an unrelated amino acid, and the
indel of a stop codon are possible [12]. These subtle protein
changes can result in functional differences for the respective
protein isoforms [15-18].
The recognition of donor and acceptor splice sites is different.
While the acceptor AG and its preceding polypyrimidine tract
is recognized by the U2AF heterodimer [19], the donor site
has an extended consensus sequence AG|GTRAGT (| is the
splice site, R stands for A or G), that is bound by base pairing
to the 5' end of the U1 snRNA [20]. However, two donor sites
that are only three nucleotides (nt) apart would result in overlapping U1 snRNA binding sites and the GTNGTN motif differs from the donor consensus sequence at the two conserved
positions +4 and +5. According to the consensus, an alternative usage of the GT dinucleotide 4 nucleotides downstream is
much more likely but results in a frameshift and thus a dramatic change of the protein if the donor is located in the coding sequence (CDS).
Here we investigate whether alternative splicing at a GT or GC
donor dinucleotide 3nt up- or downstream is possible. This
type of alternative splicing requires a GYNGYN donor motif
(Y stands for C or T) and is of interest because it would result
in similar subtle protein changes like at NAGNAG tandem
acceptors and thus increase the proteome plasticity. We
found expressed sequence tag (EST) and/or mRNA evidence

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/7/R65

for alternative splicing at 110 human GYNGYN tandem
donors and confirm the existence of both splice forms by RTPCR experiments in seven cases. We report the occurrence of
alternative splicing at GYNGYN tandem donors in six other
animals and a plant. Analyzing the GYNGYN motifs that do
and do not allow alternative splicing, we found significant differences in the stability of the U1 snRNA binding, conserved
exonic and intronic flanks between human and mouse, and
over-represented sequence motifs in the intronic flanks.

Results
Alternative splicing at tandem donor sites
Although the great majority of introns begins with a GT dinucleotide, a small fraction of 0.76% begins with GC [1]. To
investigate whether splice donor sites with the pattern GYNGYN allow the usage of both potential splice sites in humans,
we first retrieved from the UCSC Human Genome Browser
(hg17, May 2004) all RefSeq-to-genome alignments. Given
the exon-intron structure of those transcripts, we extracted a
9 nucleotide sequence (3 exonic and 6 intronic nt; -3 to +6, no
position 0) for all donor sites and checked the presence of a
GYNGYN pattern. In agreement with the donor consensus
sequence that shows no GY dinucleotide 3 nucleotides up- or
downstream of the donor site, we found only 8,550 (5.2%)
tandem donors from the total of 165,295 annotated donor
sites (Table 1). Divided into the four different GYNGYN patterns, GTNGTNs and GCNGTNs are the most frequent ones
while GCNGCN is very rare. Consistent with the proposed
nomenclature for NAGNAG acceptors, we termed the
upstream donor that renders the complete GYNGYN motif to
be intronic the 'i donor'. Likewise, the other donor is called
the 'e donor' because the upstream GYN becomes exonic
using this donor (Figure 1a). Note that, inversely to NAGNAG
acceptors, the 'e donor' is located downstream of the 'i donor'.
We use lower case letters to denote the two donor sites and
upper case letters for the two acceptor sites to distinguish
between the transcripts that arise by alternative splicing at
tandem donors or acceptors and between combinations of
alternative donor and acceptor usage (Figure 1b; see also
Discussion).
By searching dbEST and the human mRNAs from GenBank,
we identified experimental evidence for alternative splicing at
110 (1.3% of 8,550) tandem donors (in the following we term
these tandem donors 'confirmed') (Table 1; Additional data
file 1). We term the remaining 8,440 donors 'unconfirmed'
with the notion that they are enriched in GYNGYN donors
that are not functional. The percentage of confirmed tandem
donors is considerably higher for GTNGTN (2%) and
GTNGCN (1.6%) patterns. No confirmed GCNGCN donor was
found, presumably because this motif is very rare and because
the weaker GC donor requires a more stringent sequence context. Since ESTs are random high-throughput samples from
the transcriptome, spurious or mis-spliced entries may pollute dbEST, especially if the EST number for a particular locus

Simultaneous usage of e or i donor and E or I acceptor results in four
different transcripts (e-E, i-E, e-I, and i-I).

In some cases it has been reported that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the vicinity of donor sites lead to a
shift in the splice site [24-26]. To check if there is a general
trend that confirmed GYNGYNs might be influenced by SNPs
in their genomic flanks, thus giving rise to allele-specific
splice forms [27], we selected all SNPs from dbSNP that are
mapped to the 100 nucleotide context up- and downstream of
these tandem donors. We found that 64 (58%) of the
confirmed GYNGYNs do not have an annotated SNP in this
206 nucleotide region. As a control we randomly selected 500
unconfirmed GYNGYNs and found that 56% (279 of 500) do

Furthermore, we generated a sequence logo for the genomic
context of confirmed tandems, unconfirmed GYNGYNs
where either the e or i donor is confirmed, and donor sites
without a GYNGYN motif (Figure 2). The three nucleotides
up- and downstream of confirmed tandem donors are nonrandomly distributed (Figure 2b), consistent with the observation that both donor sites are alternatively used in the
splice process. In contrast, either the upstream or downstream side of unconfirmed GYNGYNs is more randomly distributed. The higher conservation of the AG upstream of the
unconfirmed GTNGTN and GTNGCN motifs with annotated
i donor (Figure 2c) indicates that the non-consensus intronic
sequence (compare Figure 2a) is compensated by a more
stringent match to the exonic part of the donor consensus
sequence.

(a)

A or G is strongly preferred at intron position +3 for standard
donor sites GTN, while T and C have lower frequencies [23].
We classified the confirmed GTNGTN donors according to
their pattern into three groups: GTRGTR (R = A or G); GTTGTR, GTRGTT or GTTGTT; and GTCGTN or GTNGTC. The
GTRGTR pattern is clearly preferred as 86% (70 of 81) of the
confirmed GTNGTN donors belong to this group. A smaller
fraction has one or two T at the N-positions (8 of 81, 10%) and
the third group is very rare, with only three cases. These findings indicate that the common splicing machinery is operating at these sites. For GTNGCN and GCNGTN donors, we
found very similar results: 21 of 29 (72%) have R at both Npositions and two (7%) one T. In addition, we found the
exceptional pattern GTAGCC six times (21%).

is high [21,22]. However, the likelihood of splicing errors
decreases if the respective splice event is represented by more
than one EST and/or if the EST ratio between alternative
splice forms is not extreme. From the 110 confirmed tandems,
50 (45%) have at least two ESTs and 19 (17%) have at least five
ESTs for e as well as i transcripts. Likewise, in 85 cases (77%)
the minor splice form is confirmed by more than 1% of the
ESTs that are spliced at the tandem donor, and in 49 cases
(45%) this fraction is at least 5%. Thus, although we cannot
exclude that some confirmations of GYNGYN tandem donors
represent rare errors of the splice machinery, the majority
seems to comprise real alternative splice events.

not have a SNP in this 206 nucleotide region. Thus, we conclude that most of the confirmed tandems are not associated
with allele-specific splice forms.

Experimental verification of alternative GYNGYN
splicing
To further support the EST-derived confirmation of alternative splice events at tandem donor sites, we performed RTPCR in several human tissues. We selected eight genes with
confirmed GYNGYNs having at least three ESTs for e and i
transcripts (Table 2, Figure 3a). We directly sequenced the
RT-PCR products and inspected the sequencing traces for
overlapping trace signals after the exon-exon junctions (Figure 3, e+i). This approach is based on control experiments
showing that minor splice forms with a frequency down to
10% of the total transcripts can be clearly detected by direct
sequencing (Additional data file 5). For seven of these eight
GYNGYNs, we found e and i transcripts in all tissues where
expression of the respective gene was observed. We detected
no variation among the tissues, suggesting that these seven
tandem donors are not regulated in a tissue-specific manner.
Next, we analyzed the splicing at the tandem donor of STAT3
in leucocytes of six individuals and consistently observed
both transcripts. This agrees with our in silico finding that
tandem donor splicing in general does not depend on specific
genotypes and further excludes the possibility that a peculiarity of the spliceosome or its components is the reason for the
two splice forms.

Differences in U1 snRNA binding for confirmed and
unconfirmed GYNGYN donors
The U1 snRNA determines the donor site by base pairing with
the mRNA [20]. To define the strength of a donor site, we calculated: the average free energy of U1 snRNA binding; the
average number of base pairs between donor sites and U1
snRNA [28]; and the maximum entropy scores [29]. In general, the e donor of confirmed GTNGTNs has a higher
strength compared to the i donor (Additional data file 2). In
agreement with that, the e donor is annotated in 73% (59 of
81) of the confirmed GTNGTN donors in RefSeq. Furthermore, the e donor is represented by an average of 233 ESTs,
which is about tenfold higher than the average of 24 ESTs for
the i donor. These findings can be explained with a stronger
consensus sequence downstream of a standard GT donor
compared to the three upstream positions (Figure 2a). For
GTNGCN and GCNGTN tandems, we have to distinguish
between the GT and GC donor site since GT is stronger than
GC (Additional data file 2). Consistently, of the 29 confirmed
GTNGCN and GCNGTN tandems, the GT donor is annotated
in 23 cases (79%) in RefSeq and the splicing at the GT donor
is represented by an average of 116 ESTs compared to the
average of four ESTs for GC donors.
Nevertheless, there are 17 of the 81 confirmed GTNGTN tandems with more ESTs for the i donor than the e donor. Therefore, we compared the free energy values and found that 15 of
these 17 cases (88%) have a lower free energy for the i donor,

thus allowing a more stable U1 binding (Figure 4a). Likewise,
56 of the remaining 64 confirmed GTNGTNs (88%) with
more ESTs for the e donor have a lower free energy for the e
donor. For GTNGCN and GCNGTN tandems, we found very
similar results as in 90% (26 of 29) the donor with the lower
free energy is represented by more ESTs. In agreement with
other experimental and computational studies [30-32], the
free energy of the U1 snRNA binding generally determines the
donor that is used more frequently.

variants.

Confirmed tandem donors have over-represented
motifs in their intron flanks

refereed research

Since the free energy of U1 binding seems not to be the only
discriminative criterion, we searched for other differences
between confirmed and unconfirmed GTNGTNs. The regulation of alternative splicing often involves auxiliary exonic and
intronic splice enhancer and silencer elements (abbreviated
ESE, ESS, ISE, and ISS, respectively) that are bound by transacting RNA-binding proteins like serine/arginine rich (SR)

deposited research

We conclude that: stable U1 binding is necessary but not sufficient for alternative tandem donor splicing; the currently
confirmed GYNGYN represent a large fraction of all functional tandem donors; and, in contrast to NAGNAG acceptors
[14], alternatively spliced GYNGYNs are not easily
predictable.

reports

Since only a small fraction of all human tandem donors are
confirmed, we searched for differences between confirmed
and unconfirmed ones. Plotting the free energy values for e
and i donors shows that most confirmed GTNGTNs are
located at the left part (Figure 4a) while unconfirmed
GTNGTNs can be separated by having a low free energy for
either the e or the i donor (Figure 4b). Comparing the average
free energies, we found that the e as well as the i donor of confirmed GYNGYNs is significantly stronger than the respective
unannotated donor of unconfirmed GYNGYNs (Table 3, ttest, P-value < 0.00001). In contrast, the annotated donor of
unconfirmed GYNGYNs is significantly stronger than the
respective donor of confirmed GYNGYNs (Table 3, t-test, Pvalue < 0.00001). We repeated this analysis using the average
number of base pairs and the maximum entropy scores to
measure the strength of donor sites and found the same
results (Table 3, t-test, all P-values < 0.00001). Dividing the
confirmed tandem donors into GTNGTNs, GTNGCNs and
GCNGTNs also leads to consistent results (Additional data
file 2). Thus, unconfirmed tandem donors are characterized
by a strong donor that successfully competes for U1 snRNA
binding with the much weaker donor. The smaller difference
between both donors for confirmed tandems probably allows

reviews

We assumed that the strength of both donors might be a criterion to distinguish functional from non-functional tandem
donors. To test this experimentally, we selected nine unconfirmed GTNGTNs with a low free energy for both donor sites
for experimental verification. As for confirmed GTNGTNs,
RT-PCR products were directly sequenced and the sequencing traces were inspected for overlapping sequences. For
none of the nine candidates, we found evidence for alternative
splicing at the tandem donor, suggesting that the majority of
unconfirmed GTNGTNs is presumably not alternatively
spliced. However, our direct sequencing approach does not
exclude that the alternative transcript is expressed at a low
frequency.

proteins and hnRNPs [33-36]. Previous computational studies followed by experimental verification identified 238 hexamers as ESEs [37], 2,060 octamers as ESEs and 1,019
octamers as ESSs [38], and 133 hexamers as ISE motifs in the
vicinity of donor sites [39]. We used these motifs to compare
their average frequency between both groups. The 100 nucleotide exonic flanks of confirmed GTNGTNs are indistinguishable from unconfirmed ones when comparing the frequency
of the 238 ESE hexamers (average of 10 ESEs per exon flank
for both groups) and have a slight but not significantly higher
frequency of ESE octamers (average 7.2 versus 6.5). The ESS
frequency is slightly, but not significantly, lower for exon
flanks of confirmed tandem donors (average 1.3 versus 2).
However, we found a significantly higher frequency of ISE
motifs in the 100 nucleotide intron flanks for confirmed
GTNGTNs (average 10 versus 8, t-test: P = 0.0174). We
repeated this analysis using a shorter exonic/intronic context
(50 nt) and found consistent results (data not shown).
To find out if specific ISE hexamers are statistically over-represented, we used a resampling strategy. We randomly sampled 10,000 sets, each comprising 81 intron flanks from
unconfirmed GTNGTNs. We estimated the P-value as the
fraction of random sets with a higher frequency of a given ISE
hexamer compared to the observed frequency in confirmed
tandem donors. CGGGGT is the only one among the 133ISE
motifs that is significantly over-represented in the vicinity of
confirmed GTNGTN donors as all 10,000 random sets have a
lower frequency (P < 1/10,000 × 133 = 0.0133 to correct for
multiple testing). To find out if other sequence motifs are
over-represented in the intron flanks of confirmed tandem
donors, we repeated this procedure with tetramers. A word
length of 4 nucleotides was chosen to account for the rather
small data set. We only compared the 119 tetramers that occur
at least with the expected frequency in the intron flanks of
confirmed GTNGTNs. We found a significant overrepresentation for GGGT and CGGG (both have a higher frequency in
only two random sets, P < 3/10,000 × 119 = 0.0357), while
the tetramer GGGG has a corrected P-value slightly above the
0.05 threshold (higher frequency in five random sets, P <
0.0714). Since both GGGT and CGGG are substrings of the
over-represented ISE CGGGGT, no new sequence motifs were
found. The common feature of the over-represented sequence
motifs is the G triplet. Interestingly, this motif occurs in 82 of
the 133 ISEs [39] and is a known splice enhancer [40]. Since
both splice sites of confirmed GTNGTNs are weaker compared to the annotated splice site of unconfirmed ones (Table
3), the G triplets might simply be associated with weak
GTNGTNs. To exclude this possibility, we compared the average GGG frequency with unconfirmed GTNGTNs having a
low U1 binding potential for both e and i donor (average free
energy -3 kcal/mol for the e donor, -2.2 for the i donor) and
still found an over-representation in the intron flanks of confirmed GTNGTNs (average 4.4 versus 2.6 G triplets per intron
flank). Since this triplet was found to be more frequent in
shorter introns [41], we divided our confirmed and uncon-

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/7/R65

firmed datasets into short and long introns using 200 nucleotide as a cut-off. Consistently, the GGG is more frequent in
the flanks of short as well as long introns with confirmed
GTNGTNs (average 8.3 versus 4.4 G triplets per short intron,
average 3.4 vs 2.7 per long intron). We also observed a noticeable higher ISE hexamer frequency in the intronic flanks of
confirmed GTNGCN and GCNGTN tandems (average 12.7
versus 10.8, not significant), but only a slightly higher
frequency of ESE hexamers and octamers in their exon flanks
(data not shown). Specifically, G triplets are also more frequent in the intronic flanks of confirmed GTNGCN and
GCNGTN donors compared to unconfirmed ones (average 5
versus 4.1). Thus, the occurrence of G triplets is another discriminating criterion between confirmed and unconfirmed
tandem donors.

Protein impact of alternative splicing at GYNGYN
donors
Of the 81 confirmed GTNGTNs, 72 (89%) are located downstream of a coding exon; thus, alternative splicing at these
sites results in 3 nucleotide indels into the coding sequence.
The effect for the protein depends on the phase of the intron
as well as the sequence of the GTNGTN and the upstream/
downstream exon. In intron phase 0 (intron location between
two codons) the GTN of the i donor is inserted/deleted and
codes for a valine. In intron phase 1 and 2 (location between
the first and second codon position, respectively), three different events are possible: indel of a single amino acid;
exchange of a dipeptide and a different amino acid; and indel
of a stop codon. Of the 72 GTNGTNs, 37 (51%) are located in
phase 0, thus a valine indel is the most frequent event at the
protein level. Of the 28 (39%) GTNGTNs in phase 1, 18 result
in single amino acid events (14 times glycine, 2 times
arginine, 2 times serine), 8 exchange a dipeptide and an unrelated amino acid and in two cases splicing at the i donor creates a stop codon. The 7 (10%) confirmed GTNGTNs in phase
2 are interesting since they either result in indels of rare
amino acids (three times tryptophan, one cysteine, one tyrosine) or insert/delete a stop codon in two cases.
Thus, alternative splicing at four tandem donors has a more
drastic impact on the proteins by the indel of a stop codon
(phase 1: FAM65A, NM_024519, exon 21; BRSK2,
NM_003957, exon 19; phase 2: ABC1, NM_022070, exon 8;
KLHL5, NM_001007075, exon 3). In two cases (KLHL5,
ABC1) the splice form with the premature stop codon is a
clear candidate for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay [42],
which potentially results in a down-regulation of the protein
level. For the other two cases, the tandem donor affects the
last intron of the transcript, thus the stop codon-containing
splice variant should be translated into a protein with a
shortened carboxyl terminus (FAM65A 33 residue deletion at
the carboxyl terminus, BRSK2 7 residue deletion).
The protein impact of the 28 GTNGCN and GCNGTN tandems that are located within the CDS comprise 22 single

As in humans, the preferred motif for confirmed GTNGTNs is
GTRGTR in all species except for C. elegans and A. thaliana
where a higher fraction of GTNGTNs has one or two Ts at the
N-positions (Table 5). The corresponding nucleotide in U1

reports

Next, we compared the frequency of single amino acid events
in phase 1 and 2 for confirmed and as a control for unconfirmed GTNGTNs. While only 42% (495 of 1,180) unconfirmed tandem donors in phase 1 result in a single residue
indel, this percentage is significantly higher for confirmed
tandems (64%, 18 of 28, Fisher's exact test: P = 0.02). The
small number of phase 2 tandems does not allow a significant
result, although the same trend is visible (100%, 5 of 5 confirmed tandems; 76%, 431 of 566 unconfirmed tandems;
leaving stop codon events out). These findings argue for a
preference to insert/delete only single amino acids, presumably because this is a less dramatic event compared to dipeptide exchanges. However, we cannot exclude the possibility
that this result is an indirect consequence of a sequence bias
of the GTNGTN motif and its context for confirmed tandems
that primarily aims at a more stable U1 snRNA binding. For
GTNGCN and GCNGTN tandems, only phase 2 donors result
in a high percentage of single amino acid indels (100%, 5 of 5
confirmed; 81%, 781 of 962 unconfirmed) while phase 1
events show no bias (40%, 4 of 10 confirmed; 48%, 524 of
1103 unconfirmed).

melanogaster), and nematode (Caenorhabditis elegans).
The percentage of GTNGTN motifs in all donor sites is quite
similar in all species and ranges between 2.1% and 3.4%
(Table 4). For mouse, rat, zebrafish, fruitfly, and nematode,
evidence for alternative splicing is found for 0.8% to 1.5% of
all GTNGTN donors (Additional data file 3). The minor splice
form is represented by at least 5% of the ESTs that are spliced
at the tandem donor for most confirmed GTNGTNs (47% for
mouse, 83% for rat, 60% for zebrafish, 90% for fruitfly, 92%
for nematode), making splicing errors unlikely. Furthermore,
53% (26 of 49) of the mouse tandem donors have at least two
ESTs for both splice forms, while this percentage drops for
the other species due to the lower EST number (25% for rat,
60% for zebrafish, 42% for fruitfly, 31% for nematode). For
chicken, we found only one confirmed tandem donor (0.2% of
all GTNGTNs). Whether this lower percentage points at an
exception for chicken is difficult to assess and deserves further research as the number of RefSeq transcripts and ESTs is
rather limited. Next, we searched for GTNGCN and GCNGTN
donors in those six species and, as for GTNGTNs, we found a
comparable percentage of tandem donors and confirmed
ones in all species (Table 4, Additional data file 3). Finally, we
searched tandem donors in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana
using the CDS annotation from GenBank and detected 36
confirmed GTNGTNs and 8 confirmed GCNGTNs/GTNGCNs
(Table 4, Additional data file 3). Thus, all investigated species
are able to produce e and i transcripts at tandem donors by
alternative splicing and this phenomenon is not restricted to
humans.

pseudouridine (ψ), thus allowing base pairings with A or G
[43,44]. We could not find an U1 snRNA gene with a different
nucleotide at this position in the C. elegans or A. thaliana
genome. Thus, except for the possibility of non-canonical ψ-T
base pairings that have been observed at position +3 [30], we
currently have no other explanation for the higher percentage
of GTT tandem donors in these two species.

Conservation of exonic and intronic flanks in mouse
Having observed several alternative GTNGTN splice events in
human and mouse, we found conservation of the GTNGTN
motif for 53 (65.4%) of the 81 human confirmed GTNGTNs.
To assess whether this percentage is high or not, we counted
GTNGTN conservation for the 3,909 unconfirmed tandems
(162 of the 4,071 have no orthologous locus in mouse) and
found a very similar percentage of 65.5% (2,561 of 3,909). The
fraction of tandem donors that have a completely identical
GTNGTN pattern in mouse is also equal: 40 of 81 (49.4%)
confirmed, 1,939 of 3,909 (49.6%) unconfirmed. Thus, there
is no evidence for a general selection pressure to maintain
confirmed tandem donors since the divergence of the humanmouse ancestor.
However, a considerable fraction (10 of 53 (19%)) of the conserved and confirmed human GTNGTNs is also confirmed in
mouse. For example, the GTAGTT donor of intron 21 of
STAT3 is conserved in mouse and both e and i transcripts are
supported by mouse ESTs. As in humans, we performed RTPCR in several mouse tissues to further support the ESTderived confirmation of alternative splice events (Figure 3b).
We found experimental evidence for alternative splicing at
the Stat3 tandem donor in all investigated tissues and
observed a strikingly similar trace pattern in human and
mouse (Figure 3, e+i). Accordingly, the ratio of e and i transcripts estimated by the EST/mRNA counts are virtually
identical (e transcripts 57 of 74 (77%)) human ESTs vs 55 of
69 (79.7%) mouse ESTs). To accurately quantify the ratio of e
and i transcripts in one selected tissue, we subcloned the RTPCR product, sequenced individual clones and found a
remarkable agreement in the transcript ratio: 82.8% of the

human clones indicate splicing at the e donor, which is almost
equal to 85.3% in the mouse (Figure 3, e:i). Interestingly, this
tandem donor is conserved in several other mammals and the
e:i ratio is very similar (9:2 ESTs for rat, 12:3 ESTs for cow,
9:1 ESTs for dog). This indicates that, in addition to the tandem donor, regulatory elements may be conserved.
The intronic flanks of alternative exons are significantly more
conserved in mouse compared to the flanks of constitutive
exons, a fact which is presumably attributed to the force to
maintain regulatory elements [45]. From the human-mouse
genomic alignments, we calculated a per-position identity
value for the region 30 nucleotides up- and downstream of
the GTNGTNs. For a specific position, this value is the fraction of identical nucleotides in all alignments [45,46]. We calculated per-position identities for three groups: group 1,
confirmed human tandem donors with a conserved GTNGTN
motif in mouse; group 2, the subset of group 1 that is confirmed in human and mouse; and group 3, unconfirmed
human tandems. Plotting these average values, it can be seen
that group 1 and, in particular, group 2 have noticeably higher
identities for both the exonic and intronic side compared to
group 3 (Figure 5). The exonic identities for the 10 human and
mouse confirmed and conserved tandem motifs exceed 90%
for most positions, a feature that is also typical for alternative
exons [47]. Furthermore, the GTNGTN pattern with 3 nucleotides up- and downstream is completely identical between
both species for these 10 tandems and average identities of
more than 80% are observed for the first 13 intronic
positions.

Discussion

We report the occurrence of alternative splice donor usage for
GTNGTN, GTNGCN, and GCNGTN motifs in eight investigated eukaryotic species. Apart from our experimental verification of seven human and one mouse GYNGYN donors,
several lines of evidence indicate that the majority of
observed events is attributable to real alternative splicing.
Firstly, numerous GTNGTNs are confirmed by multiple

We found that the percentage of donor sites with a GYNGYN
motif as well as the percentage of tandem donors that are confirmed is very similar between the eight investigated species
(tolerating some variation probably due to differences in the
number of ESTs and mRNAs). Given the large evolutionary
distance between C. elegans, A. thaliana and humans, it is
likely that all species that have alternatively spliced genes are

able to produce e and i transcripts at certain tandem donor
sites. The detection of 44 alternatively spliced tandem donors
in A. thaliana is consistent with the finding that alternative
splicing in plants is not as rare as thought for a long time
[50,51]. Previously, we have found that alternative NAGNAG
splicing is widespread in human, mouse, and fruit fly but not
in C. elegans [12]. To compare the numbers of GYNGYN
donors and NAGNAG acceptors, we extended and updated
our previous NAGNAG analyses [12,14] to the seven species
having a RefSeq annotation in the UCSC Genome Browser
(Table 6). In general, the percentage of confirmed NAGNAGs
is one order of magnitude higher compared to GYNGYN
donors. This can be explained by large differences in the
mechanisms of donor and acceptor site recognition. While
the acceptor AG is bound by U2AF35, the donor site is recognized by base pairing with the U1 snRNA. In contrast to the
acceptor, the binding site of U1 comprises a larger range that
is visible by the non-random nucleotide distribution for the
last three exonic and first six intronic positions (Figure 2a).
This imposes more sequence constraints on a tandem donor
site and prevents the extensive use of potential e and i donors
compared to potential E and I acceptors. Apart from human

ESTs/mRNAs and for several of these events both e and i
transcripts are deposited in the RefSeq database. Secondly,
the existence of orthologous tandem donors that are confirmed in two or more species makes EST artifacts or database errors unlikely. Thirdly, these GTNGTN donors have a
higher conservation of the exonic and intronic flanking
regions, a situation that is typical for conserved alternative
splice events [45,46,48,49]. Fourthly, all of the six investigated human individuals express e and i transcripts for
STAT3, thus excluding the possibility of allele-specific instead
of alternative splicing [27]. Finally, by manual examination of
all human confirmed GYNGYNs, we excluded the existence of
paralogs or processed pseudogenes that could mimic alternative splicing at a tandem donor.

and mouse, the fruit fly has a relatively high percentage of
confirmed NAGNAG sites, which is probably due to the
higher percentage of tandem acceptors with the HAGHAG (H
= A, C, or T) pattern that preferably allow alternative splicing.
In contrast, a very low fraction of the NAGNAG acceptors of
C. elegans is confirmed, which is particularly striking since C.
elegans has the highest fraction of HAGHAG acceptors (Table
6). This rareness of alternative splice events at NAGNAG
acceptors is not due to differences in the EST coverage as C.
elegans has the similar percentage of confirmed tandem
donors compared to the other species (Table 4). Therefore, it
should be attributed to the unusual properties of the 3' intron
ends of C. elegans that often lack consensus sequences for the
branch point and the polypyrimidine tract [52].
Although only a fraction of the tandem donors is confirmed,
we found features that distinguish confirmed from unconfirmed ones. Since the non-annotated donor of unconfirmed
tandems does not allow a sufficiently stable binding to the U1
snRNA, the other donor is used exclusively in the splice process. For confirmed tandem donors, both sites allow a stable
binding to U1 snRNA. However, in most of the confirmed
cases one donor has a better strength and this results in its
preferred usage as measured by the EST ratio between both
transcripts. The second discriminative feature is the overabundance of G triplets in the intronic flanks of confirmed
GTNGTNs, especially for introns shorter than 200 nt. This
triplet is the core of many known ISE motifs [39,40] and was
demonstrated to function in splice site definition [41]. Interestingly, in the human alpha-globin gene, GGG elements were
shown to exert their effect by binding to the nucleotides 8-10
(5'-CCT-3') of the U1 snRNA [40]. We have searched for overrepresented tetramers and found a significantly higher frequency of CGGG and GGGT. Strikingly, the nucleotides 7-11
of U1 snRNA are 5'-ACCTG-3'. The CGGG as well as the GGGT
motifs are complementary to this part of U1; thus, it is
tempting to speculate that these motifs bind to U1 snRNA
with four instead of three base pairs. Since CGGG and GGGT
are more frequent in the intronic flanks of confirmed tandem

donors, they may be involved in alternative splicing at these
donor sites. If U1 snRNA is a critical factor, we do not expect
much variation in splicing between tissues since U1 is ubiquitously expressed in high amounts. Consistent with this
notion, the seven experimentally investigated tandem donors
exhibit similar e:i transcript ratios in all tissues.
Most confirmed GYNGYNs have a low free energy of U1
snRNA binding to both the e and i donor, suggesting that the
U1 snRNA can stably bind to both sites. However, there are a
few exceptions where one donor is much stronger than the
other one in a confirmed tandem (Figure 4a). The mechanism
of splicing at these sites remains unclear but there are several
hypotheses that might guide future investigations. For example, it has been reported that U6 snRNA rather than U1
snRNA determines a donor site in the human FGFR1 gene
[53]. Moreover, there is evidence that splicing can occur without U1 snRNA binding to the donor site [54,55]. Furthermore,
other protein factors can influence the splice site choice and/
or (de)stabilize U1 snRNA binding [56,57]. We believe that a
further experimental investigation of confirmed tandem
splice donors may help to elucidate further details of the
splicing process.
Previously, we found that the impact of SNPs in NAGNAG
acceptors on alternative splicing can be accurately predicted
[14]. Therefore, it would be interesting to check if similar
statements are possible for SNPs in GYNGYN donors. In principle, a SNP in close proximity to an unconfirmed GYNGYN
donor might increase the base pairing capability to the U1
snRNA for the alternative donor, thus enabling alternative
splicing. SNPs that affect a confirmed tandem donor might
weaken U1 binding for one donor and result in the exclusive
usage of the other. During the SNP mapping, we found two
SNPs in the GTNGTN motif of human confirmed tandem
donors. For exon 4 of FAM3B (NM_206964), the verified
SNP rs417708 results in two alleles, GTGGTA and GCGGTA.
For the C allele, the free energy of the i and e donor is -3.4 and

Identification of GYNGYN donors and NAGNAG
acceptors

refereed research
interactions

For checking if a GYNGYN donor is confirmed (at least one
EST/mRNA for the e as well as i transcript), we compiled two
search strings: 30 nucleotides from the upstream exon and 30
nucleotides from the downstream exon for the i transcript;
and 30 nucleotides from the upstream exon, the GYN of the i
donor and 30 nucleotides from the downstream exon for the
e transcript. Then, we used BLAST against all ESTs and
mRNAs for the respective species, allowing at most one mismatch or one gap but demanding exact identity for the region
27-33 for i-transcripts and 27-36 for e-transcripts. The ESTs
were downloaded from the UCSC Genome Browser (est.fa.gz,
November 2005). mRNAs were downloaded from GenBank
at the same date as the ESTs. For acceptor sites with a NAGNAG pattern, we repeated the analysis using analogous procedures and the same data described above.

deposited research

We downloaded from the UCSC Genome Browser [66] the
Human genome assembly (hg17, May 2004) as well as RefSeq
annotation (refGene.txt.gz, November 2005). We discarded
transcripts with an erroneous open reading frame or ambiguous characters in their sequence. If more than one entry with
the same RefSeq ID exists, we selected the transcript with the
highest number of exons. From the transcripts, we extracted
a list of unique genomic positions of donor sites. We checked
the presence of a GT/GC dinucleotide at the annotated donor
position and 3 nucleotides up- or downstream. We repeated
this procedure for the other six eukaryotes having a RefSeq
annotation in the UCSC Genome Browser. The respective
genome assemblies are mm6 (March 2005) for M. musculus,
rn3 (June 2003) for R. norvegicus, galGal2 (February 2004)
for G. gallus, danRer2 (June 2004) for D. rerio, dm2 (April
2004) for D. melanogaster, and ce2 (March 2004) for C. elegans. For A. thaliana, we used the genome assembly (NCBI,
build 5.0) to build a list of donor sites according to the CDS
feature annotations in GenBank format and screened this list
for donor sites with a GYNGYN sequence pattern.

Conservation analysis in mouse
Human-mouse genomic alignments (hg17-mm6) were downloaded from the UCSC Genome Browser (vsMm6/axtNet,
March 2005). We used the genomic position of human and
mouse donor sites to select the respective alignment chain.
From the alignments, we determined whether a human
GTNGTN donor is conserved (there is also a GTNGTN motif
in mouse) or completely identical. For the per-position iden-

information

Despite many GYNGYN donors, we found only a minority
that allows alternative splicing. Nevertheless, among the
human confirmed and evolutionary conserved tandem
donors we found a significant fraction to be confirmed in
other species. Moreover, the splicing pattern of the STAT3
GTNGTN donor is strikingly equal in human and mouse. In
light of the discussion about functional versus non-functional
alternative splicing [21,62], this is a strong indication that
these alternative splicing events are not splicing noise. Consistently, such subtle changes by alternative splicing may
result in functional differences for the two proteins. An
arginine insertion between two zinc fingers results in a
human glucocorticoid receptor isoform (NM_001018075,
exon 3, GTAGTG) with an activity reduced to 48% [63,64].
Interestingly, this tandem donor is also conserved and confirmed in mouse. A similar subtle 6 nucleotide shift at a
GTAAATGT donor of ALDH18A1 results in an isoform that is

insensitive to ornithine inhibition [65]. Furthermore, there
are at least four reported cases of functional differences by
alternative NAGNAG splicing [15-18]. Thus, subtle alternative splice events are interesting candidates for further
research, especially since several of them occur in known disease genes [14].

reviews

Higher eukaryotes typically express multiple transcripts and
proteins from a single gene. A prominent mechanism is alternative splicing as about 74% of the human multi-exon genes
express more than one splice variant [4]. Protein isoforms
can also be expressed from paralogous genes. Large gene families are observed to have a reduced frequency of alternative
splicing, consistent with the idea that the variability of those
gene products comes from the divergence of the gene copies
[60]. While most research focused on large changes introduced by alternative splicing, it is becoming clear that there is
a surprisingly high number of very similar protein isoforms.
There are several mechanisms to introduce subtle protein
changes. The most widespread type is alternative splicing at
NAGNAG acceptors [12,15]. Furthermore, very similar mutually exclusive exons can lead to similar but functionally different proteins [61]. Here, we found that alternative splicing at
GYNGYN donor sites occurs in all eight investigated species.
Despite not as frequent as confirmed NAGNAG acceptors, the
diverse protein changes further contribute to the plasticity of
these proteomes. Confirmed tandem donors and acceptors
are able to insert 12 of the 20 different amino acids by single
amino acid events and the dipeptide exchanges are even more
diverse. Further flexibility comes from the simultaneous use
of a GYNGYN donor and a NAGNAG acceptor for one intron
(Figure 1b). Such an example is intron 9 of BRUNOL4
(NM_020180), for which we found 14 e-E, 3 i-E and 6 e-I
transcripts in dbEST that result in protein forms with a GPA,
AA, or GP peptide, respectively.

comment

for the T allele (-5.3 for i and -5.9 kcal/mol for the e donor).
This agrees well with the prediction of the splice site analysis
server [58,59]. Thus, it is likely that only the T allele produces
two splice forms. The second SNP (rs11672749) is especially
interesting, since it affects the tandem donor of exon 5 of the
maternally imprinted PEG3 gene (NM_006210, GTGGTG
and GTGGGG alleles). Both homozygous G genotypes and
heterozygous genotypes with a maternally inactivated T allele
will result in an exclusive splicing at the i donor.

tity computation, we considered the alignment part up to 100
positions upstream and downstream. For each position, we
counted how often there is identity between human and
mouse (Nid), and how often there is a mismatch or gap
(Nmm). The per-position identity value is Nid/(Nid+Nmm).
Alignment positions with an 'N' aligned to a nucleotide were
ignored.
To find tandem donors that are orthologous and confirmed in
human and mouse, we used BLAST with the human-confirmed search strings against the search strings of the mouseconfirmed GTNGTNs. Furthermore, we used BLAST with the
human-confirmed search strings against the mouse ESTs and
mRNAs. Using the UCSC and Ensembl genome browser, we
manually checked each hit with an E-value of less than 1e-3
for being alternatively spliced in both species and for having
a true orthologous relationship.

Strength of a donor site
We extracted a 9 nucleotide genomic context (3 nucleotides
upstream to 3 nucleotides downstream of the GYN) for the e
and i donor of confirmed and unconfirmed GYNGYNs. The
free energy and number of base pairs with the U1 snRNA were
computed according to [28] with the Splice-site Analyzer tool
[67]. The score according to the maximum entropy model
[29] was computed using MaxEntScan [68].

Motif search
We extracted the genomic sequence 100 nucleotides
upstream (exonic) and 100 nucleotides downstream
(intronic) of GTNGTN donor motifs. To identify over-represented ISE hexamer motifs, we used a resampling procedure
to estimate the P-value for a higher frequency in the intronic
flanks of confirmed GTNGTNs. To this end we randomly sampled 10,000 sets of 81 intronic flanks of unconfirmed
GTNGTNs and computed the frequency for each of the 133
ISE motifs in the 10,000 random sets. The P-value for one
ISE is the fraction of random sets with a higher frequency
compared to the observed frequency for confirmed
GTNGTNs. To correct for multiple testing, each P-value is
multiplied by 133. For the general search for over-represented motifs, we decided to use tetramers (word length 4 nt)
instead of hexamers since the dataset of the confirmed tandems is rather small. Since we were searching for over-represented motifs in the intronic flanks of confirmed GTNGTNs,
we expected that such motifs occur at least with the expected
frequency under a null model and with a significant higher
frequency compared to the flanks of unconfirmed GTNGTNs.
There are 97 overlapping tetramers in a 100 nucleotide
sequence, thus we analyzed a total of 81 × 97 = 7,857 tetramer
occurrences. For complete random sequences, each tetramer
should occur 7857/256 = 30.7 times. Since intron sequences
are not random, we found a total of 119 tetramers that occur
30 times or more in the flanks of confirmed GTNGTNs. For
these 119 tetramers, we repeated the procedure described
above but multiplied the P-value by 119.

Experimental verification of alternative splicing at
tandem donors
Eight genes with multiple EST evidence for alternative splicing at a tandem donor were analyzed by RT-PCR in different
tissues by using cDNA from multiple tissue cDNA panels (BD
Clontech Germany, Heidelberg, Germany) as PCR templates.
Primers were designed for the exons flanking the tandem
donor with distances to these donors that allow reliable
amplification and sequencing. PCR was performed in a total
volume of 25 µl using ReadyToGo PCR beads (GE Healthcare
Europe, Munich, Germany) with 5 pmoles of each primer and
1 µl of cDNA. Cycling conditions were 94°C for 30 s followed
by 35 cycles with 94°C for 20 s, 57°C for 30 s and 72°C for 30
s, followed by a final extension at 72°C for 10 minutes. Amplified fragments were precipitated with ethanol and ammonium acetate, washed with ethanol and sequenced using
DyeTerminator chemistry (Applied Biosystems, Foster city,
USA) and the respective PCR primers on a 3730 xl DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Genes and their primer
sequences were: TOM1 (AGTTTGACATGTTTGCGCTG,
GCAGCCTTAACACCAGAGGA); STAT3 (GCCATCTTGAGCACTAAGCC, GGTTCAGCACCTTCACCATT); ANAPC4
(AGATGCTGCAGGAATCGAAG,
CTGGCTTTTGCAAACACTGA); RBM10 (AGGCTGGATCAGCAGACACT,
TCCCTCTTAGAACCCTTGGC);
ANGPT1
(ACAAGGAAGAGTTGGACACC,
GGGATTTCCAAAACCCATTT); SEMA5B (AGCACGTCCTGTGGCATC, GTCCTCGTCTCGGTCCTTCT);
CXorf44
(GAGGGCAGGACTATGGGAG,
AAATACTTCTCCTTCATAGCGGA); and LTBP1 (GGACCTGTATTTGTCAAGCCA,
TAATGCAGTGTCCTGCTCCA). In addition, Stat3 of M. musculus was analyzed in the respective Clontech mouse tissue
panel by amplifying and sequencing the homologous region
with the oligonucleotides GCCATCCTAAGCACAAAGCC and
GGCTCAGCACCTTCACCGTT. All sequence traces have been
deposited in the NCBI Trace Archive (TIs human:
1166719658-1166720385; mouse; 1166879453-1166879628).
To estimate the relative amounts of e and i transcripts of
human and mouse STAT3, we cloned the respective amplicons into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany)
and propagated the clones in Escherichia coli TOP10 cells.
Plasmids were isolated from several isolated clones and their
inserts were sequenced using universal M13 primers.
The same strategy was applied to a set of genes with unconfirmed tandem splice donors. Genes and their primers were:
A2ML1 (NM_144670, exon 17, ACTTTCCTCAGCCCCTCATT,
AGTGCAGAAACTCATCGCCT); TMEM63C (NM_020431,
exon 1, GTGCTGAGGACGCAAATCA, CATCTCCAAGGAAGTCTCCG); RNPC3 (NM_017619, exon 13, ACCGGGTGAACCAAACTGTA,
AGCTGTTACGCACAGTTCCA);
GOLGA3 (NM_005895, exon 5, CACCCCCTATATGGTCAACG, CACGACTGCTTCAGGGTGT); ART5 (NM_053017,
exon 2, GCCCCTATACAGGCCTTCTC, ATTGCAACACCGTTCAATCA); KIAA1853 (NM_194286, exon 8, CCCTCAAGCTGTGAGAGCAG,
