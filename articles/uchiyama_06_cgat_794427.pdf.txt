Abstract
Background: The recent accumulation of closely related genomic sequences provides a valuable resource for
the elucidation of the evolutionary histories of various organisms. However, although numerous alignment
calculation and visualization tools have been developed to date, the analysis of complex genomic changes, such as
large insertions, deletions, inversions, translocations and duplications, still presents certain difficulties.
Results: We have developed a comparative genome analysis tool, named CGAT, which allows detailed
comparisons of closely related bacteria-sized genomes mainly through visualizing middle-to-large-scale changes to
infer underlying mechanisms. CGAT displays precomputed pairwise genome alignments on both dotplot and
alignment viewers with scrolling and zooming functions, and allows users to move along the pre-identified
orthologous alignments. Users can place several types of information on this alignment, such as the presence of
tandem repeats or interspersed repetitive sequences and changes in G+C contents or codon usage bias, thereby
facilitating the interpretation of the observed genomic changes. In addition to displaying precomputed alignments,
the viewer can dynamically calculate the alignments between specified regions; this feature is especially useful for
examining the alignment boundaries, as these boundaries are often obscure and can vary between programs.
Besides the alignment browser functionalities, CGAT also contains an alignment data construction module, which
contains various procedures that are commonly used for pre- and post-processing for large-scale alignment
calculation, such as the split-and-merge protocol for calculating long alignments, chaining adjacent alignments, and
ortholog identification. Indeed, CGAT provides a general framework for the calculation of genome-scale
alignments using various existing programs as alignment engines, which allows users to compare the outputs of
different alignment programs. Earlier versions of this program have been used successfully in our research to infer
the evolutionary history of apparently complex genome changes between closely related eubacteria and archaea.
Conclusion: CGAT is a practical tool for analyzing complex genomic changes between closely related genomes
using existing alignment programs and other sequence analysis tools combined with extensive manual inspection.

Background
Recently, many closely related prokaryotic and eukaryotic
genome sequences have been determined, and detailed
comparisons of these sequences are providing useful
information regarding genomic evolution. To date, many
alignment programs [1-13] and visualization tools [1420] have been developed for large-scale genome comparisons. Typically, these tools are designed to extract conserved regions for identifying coding or regulatory
regions, and they often assumed a simple collinear oneto-one correspondence between the sequences being compared. However, during prokaryotic evolution (and possibly also during eukaryotic evolution), crucial events, such
as the acquisition or loss of functions that are related to
pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance, symbiosis, and
adaptation to new environments, are frequently associated with large chromosomal changes, such as insertions,
deletions, substitutions, recombinations, and duplications of chromosomal segments, rather than with single
nucleotide substitutions [21-23].
Previously, we conducted detailed comparisons of closely
related microbial genomes in order to understand the
mechanisms that generate such complex chromosomal
changes [24-29]. For these studies, we required a visualization tool that provides both global views that show the
correspondence between entire genomes and local views
that show individual sequence alignments. We noticed
that a combination of dotplot display and schematic
alignment display is quite effective to understand complex chromosomal changes. In addition, the existence of
characteristic structures, such as short tandem repeats,
interspersed repetitive sequences, as well as changes in
G+C content or codon usage bias provide valuable information regarding the processes that yield the observed
genomic changes. Although some alignment visualization
tools including PipMaker [14], ACT [19], GATA [18] and
GenomeComp [16] provide views that are suitable for
representing large-scale chromosomal changes, they are
not adequate for the detailed analysis of complex changes
in terms of the above demands.
In this report, we present a Comparative Genome Analysis
Tool (CGAT) for comparisons of closely related genomes
[see Additional file 1]. CGAT adopts a client-server architecture to provide both easy operability and advanced
functionality, which is suitable for a collaborative research
team that includes biologists who are willing to explore
the genome alignment and informaticians who have
some computer skills. CGAT visualizes precomputed
homologous segment pairs between two genomes on
both dotplot and alignment viewers. Users can explore the
alignments on these viewers using scrolling and zooming
functions and can compare the locations of several feature
segments, such as repetitive structures identified on each

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/472

genome. The preliminary versions of CGAT have been
used in our internal research projects and have proved to
be powerful in the analysis of apparently complex
genome polymorphisms [24-29].

Implementation
CGAT employs a client-server architecture, which consists
of AlignmentViewer (client; a Java application) and
DataServer (a set of Perl scripts). DataServer is a collection
of data construction scripts and CGI scripts. AlignmentViewer visualizes the alignment data obtained from
the server through the HTTP protocol or from the local file
system when the server and client are installed on the
same machine.
CGAT handles two types of data: sequence alignments
between two genomes and feature segments identified on
each genome. Feature segments are represented as the
beginning and ending positions of the segments on each
genome, and sequence alignments are represented as sets
of two homologous segments. Basically, any program can
be used to collect these data. CGAT DataServer contains a
set of data construction scripts that offers a general framework for this task. In fact, the data construction process is
almost completely automatic. In particular, when the
genomic data to be compared are already stored in the
MBGD database [30], CGAT automatically downloads
data from the MBGD server before constructing the
required data. Alternatively, users can prepare their own
genomic data in the GenBank or FASTA format.
In the following sections, we first describe the data construction protocol implemented in DataServer and then
introduce the AlignmentViewer program. In this work, we
focus on prokaryotic genome comparisons, although in
principle the program can also be applied to eukaryotic
genome comparisons.
Protocol for constructing genomic alignments
The data construction module of CGAT DataServer
defines its own protocol for calculating genomic alignments (Figure 1). However, it does not contain a program
to calculate directly genome-to-genome alignments;
instead, it uses various existing programs as alignment
engines. By default, CGAT uses BLAST [31] or MegaBlast
[32] to calculate alignments, but optionally it can incorporate FASTA [33], MUMmer [34], WABA [3], BLAT [5],
BLASTZ [7], PatternHunter [6], CHAOS [8], GAME [12],
and SSAHA [4]. In this study, we consider local alignment
tools rather than global alignment tools, such as LAGAN
[9] and AVID [11] because whole genome alignments
generally contain rearrangements that are not handled
well by global alignment tools.

Alignment construction protocol used in CGAT. The actual alignment calculation is carried out at the "all-all similarity
search" step using one of the alignment engines. For "similarity search within each genome" in the upper-left rectangle, the
same protocol is used as in the frame labeled "similarity search between genomes". See the text for details.
For the analysis of long sequences, CGAT splits one of the
genomic sequences into overlapping segments of appropriate length, performs an all-against-all comparison of
the split sequences and the other genome, and then
merges the resulting alignments that overlap with each
other. The length of split sequences is determined for each

program individually in consideration of the limitation of
the program. Although this is a common protocol for calculating genome-scale alignments using traditional alignment programs, such as FASTA, it is still useful for aligning
very long sequences using more modern programs.

A problem arises when merging overlapping alignments:
the overlapping gapped alignments may not be consistent
with each other, since they may be suboptimal or alternative optimal solutions. To solve this problem, CGAT
decomposes a gapped alignment into a set of ungapped
segment pairs (blocks) and compares the resulting sets of
blocks. The sets of blocks should coincide with each other
if and only if the overlapping gapped alignments are completely consistent. To resolve inconsistencies among
alignments, CGAT constructs a directed acyclic graph
(DAG) that consists of nodes that contain all the endpoints and some internal points of the blocks and edges
representing blocks or gaps that connect two nodes in a
gapped alignment (Figure 2), and finds a best-score path
along the DAG using a dynamic programming algorithm.
In addition to solving the above "split and merge" alignment protocol, the overlap resolution procedure is, in
some cases, also useful in simplifying the alignment output. For example, the output of PROmer, a program that

A

sequence 1

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/472

is included in the MUMmer package and that performs
translated sequence comparisons, often contains numerous overlapping alignments that correspond to the same
alignment in different reading frames. In this type of case,
the merging procedure resolves the overlap and simplifies
the output.
Typically, the graph is sufficiently simple that the problem
can be solved very quickly. However, sometimes the graph
is very complex, especially when extremely highly repetitive sequences are present. To avoid this problem, the procedure extracts highly repetitive regions from each of the
genomes by similarity searching prior to the main analysis
(HighRep feature, see below), and eliminates the alignments that are covered in large part by these regions (Figure 1). This "repeat masking" is also important in
simplifying the output because without this step, highly
repetitive matches, the number of which is the square of
the number of repetitive sequences in each sequence,
would fill almost the entire region of the alignment and

gap, and an edge of the DAG represents a block (solid line) or a gap (broken line). The blocks of two original alignments are

dotplot displays. Note that the repeat masking is carried
out after the genome-to-genome comparison, and does
not affect the alignments that are covered in small part by
such repetitive regions.
Post-processing of genome-to-genome alignments
In CGAT, each aligned segment pair is classified into one
of four classes according to the best-hit relationships as
follows: (1) orthologous segments; (2) segments duplicated only in the first genome; (3) segments duplicated
only in the second genome; and (4) paralogous segments.
An orthologous segment pair is operationally defined by
a so-called 'bidirectional best hit', i. e. the segment pair
having the best similarity score among the homologs of
either of the segments. Classes 2 and 3 are defined by unidirectional best hits, i.e., the segment pair having the best
score among the homologs of one of the segments. The
other segment pairs are classified as paralogous segments.

The actual procedure for identifying the best-hit segment
pairs is as follows: (1) all homologous segments are
mapped onto each genome and the best similarity score is
assigned to each region; and (2) an alignment that has a
score >90% of the best score over at least 50% of the segment length is extracted as the best-scoring segment pair
(note that the best score may be different among different
regions). If the segment pair is the best-scoring pair for
both of the genomes, then the segment pair is the bidirectional best pair.
Prior to the above classification process, CGAT attempts
to create longer alignments by chaining non-overlapping
adjacent alignments. This problem is similar to, but not
identical to the overlapping resolution problem described
above, since in this case only non-overlapping alignments
are considered. We considered as being adjacent a pair of
alignments in the same direction that are located within
50 kb in each of the sequences, and use the simple twodimensional chain algorithm [35] (pp. 326–329) to find
the optimal chain. The sum of the scores calculated by this
procedure is assigned to each alignment and is used to
identify orthologous segment pairs.
A similar alignment-chaining procedure is implemented
in almost every program that performs large-scale alignments so as to make a longer alignment from initially
shorter alignments. In contrast to these programs, CGAT
does not try to create a longer alignment by concatenating
the chained alignments. On the contrary, it splits the
resulting alignments into smaller pieces in the final step
when they contain large gaps (Figure 1), since eliminating
large gaps from the alignments enhances presentation in
AlignmentViewer. Nonetheless, AlignmentViewer can display these sequences as a contiguous long alignment by

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/472

calculating alignment on the fly (see the section "CGAT
AlignmentViewer" below).
Collection of feature segments
Basically, the output of any DNA sequence analysis program that extracts sequence segments can be incorporated
into CGAT as a feature segment; these analyses include
pattern searching, weight matrix analysis, and detecting
segments with atypical base composition.

Currently, we focus on the analysis of several types of
repetitive structures that are frequently associated with the
formation of genomic polymorphisms. The following
programs are included in CGAT DataServer:
1) Interspersed highly repetitive regions (HighRep) analysis. CGAT uses a simple strategy to collect this type of
repeat, in that it compares each genome to itself using the
alignment protocol described above without the postprocessing step (by default using MegaBlast as alignment
engine), maps the resulting alignment onto each genome,
and finally extracts the regions that are covered by alignments at least T times. The resulting regions can include
various types of segments, such as tRNAs, insertion
sequences (IS) or other mobile elements, and non-mobile
repetitive elements, which include bacterial interspersed
mosaic elements (BIMEs) [36], depending on the cutoff
value T. CGAT collects regions using multiple T values and
displays them with different colors in AlignmentViewer.
The resulting set of HighRep segments is also used for
masking repetitive regions in the alignment construction
protocol described above.
2) Simple repeats (SimpleRep) analysis, which examines
short tandem repeats with unit sizes of a few bases. It is
well known that SimpleRep frequently yields polymorphisms for both eukaryotes and prokaryotes [37]. CGAT
uses the Rep program (I. Uchiyama, unpublished) to collect this type of repeat. Rep uses a simple algorithm that is
similar to XNU [38]; it searches high-scoring segment
pairs (cutoff score S) between the same sequences shifted
by M bp relative to each other, to identify repeats with
unit of M bp, and outputs them if the number of repeats
is at least R. By default, M is changed from 1 to 100 and S
= 8 and R = 4 using the following scoring system: match
+1, mismatch -3.
3) Direct or inverted repeats with an intervening sequence
(DirRep/InvRep) analysis. This type of repeat is important, as it is frequently associated with insertion/deletion/
inversion events. CGAT uses the Kmatch program (I. Uchiyama, unpublished) to collect this type of repeat. Kmatch
uses the algorithm derived by Leung et al. [39] for hashing
k-tuple words to search occurrences of almost identical
sequences of at least L bp, while allowing E errors within

Page 5 of 17
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Bioinformatics 2006, 7:472

an interval of up to I; the region is extended until the ratio
of error becomes more than R. By default, we made the
following settings: L = 30, E = 5, R = 0.15 and I = 5000 for
DirRep and L = 24, E = 4, R = 0.15, and I = 5000 for
InvRep.
4) Searching for known repetitive sequences. This
approach, which is employed by the RepeatMasker program [40], is probably the most common way of identifying repetitive sequences in eukaryotic genomes. CGAT
supports this type of analysis using an alignment engine
(BLAST by default) when users carry a collection of repetitive sequences. For prokaryotic genomes, insertion
sequences (IS) are the most common type of repetitive
sequence, and the ISfinder database [41] represents a wellestablished collection of IS. Alternatively, one can use the
GIB-IS database [42] as a downloadable IS database.
Genes are also considered to be special feature segments,
and some attribute values can be assigned for each gene to
be colored by AlignmentViewer. By default, CGAT uses
the function categories assigned in the MBGD database
[30] for coloring genes, although any program that characterizes gene or protein sequences can be used to assign
attribute values. Currently, CGAT contains a program that
calculates the codon usage bias defined by Karlin et al.
[43] as well as a program that estimates G+C content at
the third codon position (GC3); these values are useful for
identifying candidates of horizontally transferred genes
from distantly-related organisms.
CGAT AlignmentViewer
The data derived by the procedure described above are
integrated and displayed in AlignmentViewer (Figure 3).
The main window of AlignmentViewer consists of an
alignment display panel (left) and a dotplot display panel
(right), in addition to a common control panel (top). By
default, the alignment and dotplot displays show precomputed alignments that are colored according to the four
classes of best-hit relationships (see above). Optionally,
the alignments can be colored according to the percentage
identities. The alignment display panel contains three
basic tracks: the central track (alignment track), which
shows a graphical representation of the alignments, and
the upper and lower tracks (annotation tracks), which
show the annotation of the upper and lower genomes,
respectively. More annotation tracks can be added to display the locations of several feature segments identified
on each genome.

Users can change the current view on each display by
pressing a scrolling or zooming button; these operations
update both the alignment and dotplot displays in a
coherent manner. Using the zooming function of the
alignment display, users can change the scale from the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/472

entire genome level to the single nucleotide level. The
scale of the dotplot display can also be changed independently of the alignment display. Furthermore, the scale of
each axis can be changed independently; this feature is
useful in visualizing the distribution of homologous
regions of a specific segment on one genome against the
entirety of the other genome (this point will be discussed
further in the Results and discussion section).
Navigating the alignment space using the scrolling function is one of the key features of CGAT. In CGAT, the
upper and lower sequences are considered as the reference
and target sequences, respectively, and navigation is primarily a move along the reference sequence with a step
size that depends on the current window size. Then the
central position on the target sequence is automatically set
according to the following rules: (1) if the next position is
still in the current alignment, take the corresponding target position on that alignment; (2) if the next position is
outside the current alignment but in some adjacent alignment, then set this alignment as the current one and take
the corresponding target position on that alignment; (3)
if there is no adjacent alignment, then search an orthologous alignment, and if there is an orthologous alignment,
then set that alignment as the current one and take the
corresponding target position on it; and (4) if there is no
alignment, move the same extent as the reference
sequence.
Basically, by continuous movement, users can navigate
the entire genomes along the orthologous alignments. In
addition, users can specify an arbitrary point on the dotplot display to move. In this manner, CGAT allows users
to navigate easily within the entire alignment space.
In CGAT, there are two modes in the alignment display
(Figure 4). In the "region-wise alignment mode" (default,
Figure 4A), alignments contained in the current region are
displayed with a consecutive region specified in each
genome. In the "reference-target alignment mode" (Figure
4B), every orthologous region of the target sequence is
mapped as a fragment onto the reference sequence. The
former mode is similar to ACT [19] and probably represents a more intuitive mode, whereas the latter mode is
similar to PipMaker [14] and possibly represents a more
informative mode for displaying large rearrangements;
however it can show only orthologous matches.
In the region-wise mode, AlignmentViewer generally displays schematically the locations of the precomputed
alignments within the region. However, when it displays
an alignment at the nucleotide sequence level, AlignmentViewer dynamically realigns the displayed sequences
using the dynamic programming algorithm for global
alignment [44]. Therefore, in this mode, users can see the

longer alignment beyond the boundary of the precomputed alignment. On the other hand, in the reference-target mode, AlignmentViewer uses the precomputed results
to display the nucleotide sequence alignments.
Users can compare the locations of several feature segments, such as several types of repetitive segments, by
loading them on the annotation tracks. In addition to
retrieving the precomputed data from the server, AlignmentViewer can request the server to perform dynamical
searches through the CGI interface. For example, users can
search for sequences similar to their query sequence in
each genome using BLAST or they can search for a motif
using the regular expression pattern search. The results are
displayed as feature segments on the annotation track in
the alignment display panel. A list of locations for each
feature segment can be shown in tabular format, which
can be used to locate each segment on the alignment display.

Results and discussion
The preliminary versions of CGAT [45] have already been
used in our several research projects in microbial compar-

ative genomics, including comparisons of Helicobacter
pylori strains [24], Pyrococcus horikoshii and P. abyssi
[25,26], Neisseria meningitidis strains, N. meningitidis
strains and N. gonorrhoeae [27], and Staphylococcus aureus
strains [28]. To highlight some unique functionalities of
CGAT, we have chosen the example of a comparison of
two strains of H. pylori. Further examples can be found on
the project home page.
Comparison of Helicobacter pylori strains 26695 and J99
Helicobacter pylori is the first bacterial species for which the
genome sequences of two different strains were determined [46,47]. Comparative analysis of these sequences
revealed several chromosomal rearrangements [47]. In
further detailed analysis, Nobusato et al. found a characteristic pattern of polymorphisms in the H. pylori
genomes, an insertion with long target duplication, which
is frequently associated with the insertion of restrictionmodification (RM) genes and which suggests a novel
mechanism of gene mobility [24]. This pattern of polymorphisms is readily detected by CGAT with data from
the direct repeat (DirRep) program loaded as feature segments (Figure 3). In this case, in addition to the DirRep

track, the duplication can also be seen in the alignment
track, in which green rectangles indicate that the aligned
regions are duplicated only in the second (J99) genome.
One can see the annotation of the inserted gene by moving the mouse cursor over it (Figure 3) and one can access
the specified web server (by default the MBGD server) by
clicking on it.
The origin of the inserted genes is another interesting
issue. Many of the strain-specific RM genes identified in
the two H. pylori genomes were suggested to be horizontally transferred from distantly related organisms because
of unusual codon usage bias and low G+C contents as
well as the unusual topology of the phylogenetic trees
[24]. In CGAT, codon usage bias and G+C content at the
third codon position are pre-calculated as gene attribute
values for each genome. Users can load one of these
attributes to change gene colors (Figure 5A and 5B). In
this case, the inserted gene showed high codon usage bias
(Figure 5A) and low G+C content (Figure 5B), which suggest a horizontal transfer event.
Another interesting feature of the H. pylori genome is the
abundance of simple repeat sequences [46,48], which are
suggested to be involved in adaptive evolution by increasing genotypic variation due to slipped-strand mispairing
[49]. The comparison of the genomes of the two strains
revealed variations in the number of sequence repetitions
[47]. Figure 5C and 5D shows the alignment display
around the fliP genes (flagellar basal body protein;
HP0685 and JHP0625) with simple repeat data (SimpleRep) and Glimmer prediction [50] loaded as feature
segments. This clearly indicates that an increase in the
length of a poly(C) tract results in a frame shift, which disrupts the reading frame of the fliP gene in strain 26695. It
has been shown that this disruption results in loss of
motility for this strain [51].
To facilitate the search for interesting structures associated
with certain classes of genes or feature segments, CGAT
provides several functions. By pressing the button farthest
to the right on the control panel (or choosing 'View =>
Gene/Segment Data Table' from the menu), one can see
the list of genes or specified feature segments in a tabular
format. By clicking on each gene or segment on this table,
one can change the current view to see alignments around
the specified locus. In addition, users can filter genes or
feature segments according to keyword or other parameter
by choosing 'Search => Filter Gene/Segment' from the
menu; in this function, only those segments that fulfill the
specified conditions are displayed on the annotation
track.
While a pair of direct or inverted repeat sequences with a
short spacer region can be easily visualized, as shown in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/472

Figure 3, it is more difficult to visualize repeat sequences
that are farther apart. Indeed, a simple zoom-out operation to enlarge the displayed region shrinks everything
and makes it difficult for users to grasp the relationship
between distant points. In this type of case, independent
scaling of the x-axis or y-axis in the dotplot display is useful. For example, the 26695 genome has a pair of inverted
repeat sequences (named repeat 7 [46]) that are located at
both ends of the rearranged segment that contains the
putative replication terminus (thick lines in Figure 6),
whereas that sequence is located at only one of the ends
in the J99 genome, which partly accounts for the observed
chromosomal inversion [47]. While this duplication is
difficult to detect in the entire dotplot display (Figure 6A),
it is clearly evident in the dotplot after zooming in on the
y-axis (Figure 6B).
Comparison of alignment engines
Another important feature of CGAT is to utilize several
alignment programs as alignment engines, including
BLASTN [31], MegaBlast[32], FASTA [33], MUMmer
(NUCmer and PROmer) [34], WABA [3], BLAT [5],
BLASTZ [7], PatternHunter (phn) [6], CHAOS [8], GAME
[12], SSAHA, and SSAHA2 [4]. These programs use different algorithms or heuristics and different parameters and
generally yield different results. Therefore, comparisons of
alignments by multiple programs can be helpful in avoiding errors. In the following, we compare the performance
characteristics of these alignment programs in terms of
their usefulness as alignment engines in CGAT. For datasets, we used four pairs of closely related bacterial
genomes: Escherichia coli K-12 [52] and O157:H7 [53],
Helicobacter pylori 26695 [46] and J99 [47], Escherichia coli
K-12 [52] and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. typhi)
CT18 [54], and Bacillus subtilis [55] and Geobacillus kaustophilus [56]. In this test, we ran each program with the
default parameter set, with the aim of characterizing each
program in a standard setting rather than fully investigating the potential performance through extensive changing
of parameters. A similar, more extensive test was performed previously with a different set of programs using
simulated data [57].

Figure 7 shows the cumulative distribution of the percentage identities of orthologous alignments in terms of alignment coverage, which is defined as the proportion of the
lengths of the orthologous alignments to the entire chromosomal length. For example, in the comparison
between the two E. coli strains (Figure 7A), most of the
orthologous alignments had >98% identity and 80% or
more of the entire chromosomes was covered by these
alignments when using either of the programs. In the
comparison between the two H. pylori strains (Figure 7B),
the programs gave more variable results, although the
identities of the alignments were still similarly distributed

colored blue. (C) ORF disruption caused by expansion of a simple repeat. The window size is 5000 bp. (D) Similar to (C),

around 95% by all the programs. On the other hand, in
the comparison between E. coli and S. typhi, a notable difference was observed (Figure 7C). WABA, BLASTZ, FASTA,
GAME, PatternHunter (phn), and PROmer gave similar
distributions centered around 80% identity and 60% or
more coverage, whereas BLASTN, MegaBlast, CHAOS,

SSAHA2, and NUCmer showed less sensitivity, and BLAT
showed extremely low sensitivity. In the comparison of B.
subtilis and B. halodurans (Figure 7D), in which the identities were centered around 65%, the difference between the
programs was clearer. WABA, BLASTZ, and FASTA showed
higher sensitivities than GAME, PROmer, and Pattern-

Hunter, and the other programs showed extremely low
sensitivities. It seems that the more-sensitive programs,
such as WABA, BLASTZ, and FASTA, are better (or
required) for comparisons of weakly similar sequences.
However, comparative studies that yield precise information on elementary processes in evolution of genome
structure are primarily those that compare genomes with
nucleotide identities of ≥90%. In these types of studies,
the sensitivity of the alignment program is not very important since the differences between the programs are small.
Instead, the selectivity of the programs becomes important for identifying evolutionarily correct alignments.
Unfortunately, there is usually a trade-off between sensitivity and selectivity, such that a more sensitive program
may be less selective. Figure 8A and 8B shows an example,
in which an apparent permutation found between
HP0488 and its ortholog JHP0440 by BLASTN cannot be
identified by BLASTZ, which was one of the most sensitive
programs in the above tests. Similar problems are often
encountered when using global alignment programs, and

sensitive local alignment programs can also suffer from
the same type of problem.
Alignment boundaries are often obscure and can vary
among different programs. We examined the percentage
identities at positions near the alignment boundaries, as
calculated by each program (Figure 9), and found conspicuous differences between the sensitive methods
(BLASTZ, FASTA, GAME, and PatternHunter) and the lesssensitive methods. In the former methods, identity substantially decreased near the alignment boundary, except
in the comparison of the less-similar species of Bacillus
and Geobacillus, whereas in the latter methods, this type of
decay was not observed. This tendency, in addition to the
increase in identity commonly observed at alignment
boundaries, is probably due to the nature of the local
alignment algorithm and is dependent upon the scoring
systems and other parameters used, as well as the alignment algorithms or heuristics. In any case, it is difficult to
say which program or set of parameters generally gives
better alignment in terms of identifying true homology. In
some cases, the aligned sequences share some conserved

motifs that suggest that they are indeed homologous,
while in other cases, these sequences may simply be nonhomologous segments generated by a substitution or
other rearrangement event. Therefore, it is recommended

to careful researchers that they use multiple programs for
choosing better alignments, thereby avoiding programspecific or parameter-specific errors.

Percentage identities at positions near the boundaries of the orthologous alignments calculated by various
programs. For each position at both ends of the orthologous alignments ≥ 500 bp, the number of matches and mismatches
were counted and the average percentage identity was calculated using a window size of 21 bp (10 bp on either side) for
smoothing. Gapped sites were eliminated from the alignments for the purpose of this calculation. The pairs of genomes to be
compared are the same as those shown in Figure 7. The large variability observed among the "non-sensitive" set of programs in
(D) is due to a lack of alignment data.

In the region-wise mode of CGAT, the alignment between
the displayed sequences is dynamically recalculated and
displayed (Figure 8C and 8D), so that users can see the
alignment beyond the boundaries of the precomputed
ones. By simply reloading the alignments, one can compare alignments using different programs, as depicted in
Figure 8. In addition, it may be helpful for users to load
some feature segments calculated by other programs, such
as a motif search program. In this way, CGAT allows users
to validate carefully alignment quality.

Conclusion

InvRep: inverted repeat

CGAT aims to help researchers to come to grips with the
complex evolutionary changes that occur between closely
related genomes through automated genome-to-genome
alignments combined with extensive manual inspection.
To achieve this goal, CGAT adopts a client-server architecture that comprises DataServer and AlignmentViewer, and
has the following prominent features: (1) DataServer provides a general framework that defines a protocol for constructing large-scale genome alignments using various
existing alignment programs; (2) DataServer also contains
programs for collecting several feature segments, including several kinds of repetitive structures; (3) AlignmentViewer consists of an alignment display and a
dotplot display with scrolling and zooming facilities,
which are updated in a coherent fashion by user operations; (4) the alignment display can contain several annotation tracks that display precomputed or dynamically
computed feature segments; (5) AlignmentViewer provides several functions that allow users to navigate efficiently through the alignment space and to filter
information so as to focus on specific features; (6) in addition to displaying precomputed alignments, AlignmentViewer can calculate alignments between any
specified regions on the fly, which enables users to validate or refine the precomputed alignments.
