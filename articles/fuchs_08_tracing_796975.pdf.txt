Abstract
Background: The island of Madagascar and surrounding volcanic and coralline islands are
considered to form a biodiversity hotspot with large numbers of unique taxa. The origin of this
endemic fauna can be explained by two different factors: vicariance or over-water-dispersal.
Deciphering which factor explains the current distributional pattern of a given taxonomic group
requires robust phylogenies as well as estimates of divergence times. The lineage of Indian Ocean
scops-owls (Otus: Strigidae) includes six or seven species that are endemic to Madagascar and
portions of the Comoros and Seychelles archipelagos; little is known about the species limits,
biogeographic affinities and relationships to each other. In the present study, using DNA sequence
data gathered from six loci, we examine the biogeographic history of the Indian Ocean scops-owls.
We also compare the pattern and timing of colonization of the Indian Ocean islands by scops-owls
with divergence times already proposed for other bird taxa.
Results: Our analyses revealed that Indian Ocean islands scops-owls do not form a monophyletic
assemblage: the Seychelles Otus insularis is genetically closer to the South-East Asian endemic O.

sunia than to species from the Comoros and Madagascar. The Pemba Scops-owls O. pembaensis,
often considered closely related to, if not conspecific with O. rutilus of Madagascar, is instead closely
related to the African mainland O. senegalensis. Relationships among the Indian Ocean taxa from
the Comoros and Madagascar are unresolved, despite the analysis of over 4000 bp, suggesting a
diversification burst after the initial colonization event. We also highlight one case of putative backcolonization to the Asian mainland from an island ancestor (O. sunia). Our divergence date
estimates, using a Bayesian relaxed clock method, suggest that all these events occurred during the
last 3.6 myr; albeit colonization of the Indian Ocean islands were not synchronous, O. pembaensis
diverged from O. senegalensis about 1.7 mya while species from Madagascar and the Comoro
diverged from their continental sister-group about 3.6 mya. We highlight that our estimates
coincide with estimates of diversification from other bird lineages.
Conclusion: Our analyses revealed the occurrence of multiple synchronous colonization events
of the Indian Ocean islands by scops-owls, at a time when faunistic exchanges involving Madagascar
was common as a result of lowered sea-level that would have allowed the formation of steppingstone islands. Patterns of diversification that emerged from the scops-owls data are: 1) a star-like
pattern concerning the order of colonization of the Indian Ocean islands and 2) the high genetic
distinctiveness among all Indian Ocean taxa, reinforcing their recognition as distinct species.

Background
The island of Madagascar is considered a biodiversity
hotspot with an intriguing endemic fauna [1]. The origin
of the island's peculiar and highly unique fauna can be
explained by two contrasting processes: vicariance when
Madagascar became separated from the African landmass
approximately 165 mya and from India approximately 88
mya [2,3], or over-water dispersal from the African, Australian and Eurasian landmasses. In near proximity to
Madagascar are several archipelagos, which have different
geological histories. The eastern islands in the Seychelles
archipelago are of granitic origin and likely broke off from
India and reached their current position some 55–75 mya
when India drifted northwards [4], while the western portion of the Seychelles is comprised of recent atolls. In contrast, the volcanic Comoros archipelago is of relatively
recent age (0–11 mya), hence the only plausible explanation for the colonization of its biota is by over-ocean dispersal from Africa, Australia, Madagascar or Eurasia.
The origin, timing and modes (vicariance versus overwater dispersal) of colonization by animals of Madagascar
and in some cases the surrounding Comoro islands have
been the focus of several research programs [5-10]. Given
the antiquity of the break-up of Indo-Madagascar from
Africa, which considerably pre-dates the first known fossil
records of most modern families or genera of animals, in
particular vertebrates, it is now assumed that the majority
of extant groups arrived on Madagascar via over-water dispersal [11]. From recent phylogenetic studies, as well as
traditional taxonomy, it is inferred that most of the Malagasy avifauna originated from African ancestors, although
colonization events from Eurasia and Australia have also
been documented for flying organisms such as bats and
birds [12-16].

Interpreting the origin of certain components of the Malagasy avifauna is in many cases difficult when based on
current taxonomical classifications alone as several genera
of birds are shared between Madagascar, Africa and Eurasia. Among these are scops-owls of the genus Otus. As currently defined, Otus is present in five biogeographic areas
(Indo-Malaya, Afrotropics, Nearctic, Neotropics, Palearctic) [17]. However, monophyly of Otus (sensu [17]) is
uncertain; some molecular studies suggested that the New
World Otus (Megascops-including Otus flammeolus, see
[18]), which differ from Old World Otus by song type, are
genetically more closely related to the widespread owl
genera Strix and Bubo [19,20] whereas the African Whitefaced Owl (O. leucotis) has closer affinities with the genus
Asio [20]. The above-mentioned taxa excluded, Otus species have their center of diversity in Eurasia (26 species);
secondary radiations occur in the Indian Ocean (six or
seven species) and Africa (four species). To our knowledge, the earliest known Otus fossil, a distal end of the
right humerus, is from western Kenya and dates from the
Miocene (16.5–18.5 mya; [21]). This partial fossil is morphologically close to O. senegalensis, but its relationship
among members of the genus is not clear. The western
Indian Ocean taxa are often thought to constitute a superspecies (rutilus group) of five or six species [22]: O. capnodes from Anjouan, O. mayottensis from Mayotte, O.
moheliensis from Mohéli, O. pauliani from Grande
Comore, and O. rutilus/O. madagascariensis from Madagascar (see [23] for a discussion about phylogeography
and taxonomic status of the two Malagasy forms), and O.
insularis from the granitic Seychelles. The latter species
shows apparent affinities, based on vocalization data, to
the Indonesian O. magicus [24]. Most of the western
Indian Ocean taxa are poorly known: specific status has
been proposed only within the last twenty years for Otus

pauliani, O. capnodes, O. madagascariensis and O. mayottensis using both biometric and vocalization data [25-28],
while O. moheliensis was first described in 1998 [29].
The evolutionary and biogeographic history of the Indian
Ocean Otus taxa has not been the focus of a phylogenetic
study. In this paper, we use two nuclear introns
(myoglobin intron-2 and TGFB2 intron-5) and four mitochondrial protein coding-genes (ND2, ND3, ATP6, cytochrome-b) in order to propose a first multi-locus
phylogeny of scops-owls and to track their colonization
history of the western Indian Ocean islands in space and
time. We additionally compare the biogeographic affinities of Malagasy scops-owl species to those of other Malagasy avian lineages which have been the focus of recent
genetic studies [12,13,16].

Results
Sequence properties
We obtained between 680 and 726 bp (Otus lettia ussuriensis and Aegolius acadicus, respectively) for the myoglobin
intron-2 resulting in a final alignment of 749 bp. Among
the 749 bp, 151 were variable (20%) and 56 were parsimony informative (7.5%). Maximum Likelihood (ML)
analyses yielded one tree (-ln = 2198.81) that slightly differs topologically from the 50% majority consensus rule
tree obtained from the Bayesian analyses (-ln = 2442.98).
We obtained between 561 and 593 bp (O. leucotis and O.
pembanesis/O. senegalensis Allele 1, respectively) for the
TGFB2 intron-5 resulting in a final alignment of 605 bp.
Three individuals were found to be length-variant heterozygotes: O. leucotis possesses a CCT duplication in a region
with a CCT pattern in all other species, O. rutilus (FMNH
431150) possesses a one base pair deletion (G) in position 171 of the alignment, and O. senegalensis possesses a
one base pair insertion (A in position 559 of our alignment; this insertion was also found in the two O. pembaensis individuals sequenced). The two O. senegalensis alleles
also differ by two further mutations; these two alleles clustered together as the sister-group to O. pembaensis in a ML
analysis (tree not shown). Therefore, we use the consensus sequence (the two single nucleotide polymorphisms
were coded using the appropriate IUPAC code) from the
two O. senegalensis alleles for further phylogenetic analyses. Only the alleles without the insertion/deletion were
included in the phylogenetic analyses for O. leucotis and
O. rutilus, as the insertion/deletion events were autapomorphic in both cases. Among the 601 base pairs retained
for the analyses, 163 were variable (27%) and 71 were
parsimony informative (11.8%). ML analyses yielded one
tree (-ln = 2131.71) that slightly differs from the 50%
majority consensus rule tree obtained from the Bayesian
analyses (-ln = 2179.36).

The topologies obtained from the nuclear loci were very
similar to each other, delineating the primary clades without achieving resolution at the tips (see Additional Files 1
and 2). The 50% majority consensus rule tree obtained
from the Bayesian analyses (Figure 1, -ln = 4638.29) and
Maximum Parsimony strict consensus tree (105675
equally parsimonious trees of 412 steps, CI = 0.82, RI =
0.86) of the two concatenated nuclear loci provided a
well-resolved topology for inter-generic relationships as
well as some resolution of relationships among the primary Otus lineages but failed to provide resolution among
members of the Indian Ocean radiation.
The concatenated mitochondrial sequences retained for
analyses were 2983 bp long (1047 bp for ND2, 684 bp for
ATP6, 351 bp for ND3 and 901 bp for cytochrome-b) and
correspond to the positions 5246 to 6281 (ND2), 9240 to
9923 (ATP6), 10776 to 11120 (ND3), and 15011 to
15911 (cytochrome-b) of the Gallus gallus mitochondrial
genome sequence [30]; GenBank accession number
X52392). The ATP6 and cytochrome-b sequences contained no insertions, deletions and stop-codons in the
reading frame. The ND2 sequence of Aegolius acadicus
exhibits a two-codon insertion (CAA ACC) just before the
stop codon. All the ND3 sequences exhibited the pyrimidine insertion (T for O. capnodes, C for all other species
analyzed) previously reported for several clades of birds
[31]; this extra-nucleotide was removed before phylogenetic analyses. Partitioning the gene by codon positions
significantly improved the fit of models to the data for all
four mitochondrial loci, as inferred from the Bayes Factor
(BF) values (BFND2 = 826.3, BFATP6 = 681.7, BFND3 =
319.1, BFcytb = 1048.8). Mitochondrial gene trees were
very similar to each other (ND2: ML -ln = 10556.45, BI
partitioned by codon position = 10161.23 – Additional
File 3; ATP6: ML -ln = 6550.30, BI partitioned by codon
position = 6232.87 – Additional File 4; ND3: ML -ln =
3266.29, BI partitioned by codon position -ln = 3146.47
– Additional File 5; cytochrome-b, ML -ln = 8623.79, BI
partitioned by codon position -ln = 8128.06 – Additional
File 6), albeit levels or resolution varied among genes. As
expected, no conflict was detected between the individual
evolutionary histories of the mitochondrial gene trees (as
inferred from posterior probabilities). The 50% majorityrule tree obtained from the concatenated analyses of the
mitochondrial genes (partitioned by gene and codon
position: -ln = 27725.63, Figure 1) was very similar in
terms of topology and number of supported nodes to the
MP strict consensus tree (two equally most parsimonious
trees of 5922 steps, CI = 0.42, RI = 0.60).
Phylogenetic results
The individual trees obtained from the two nuclear
introns and mitochondrial data sets were very similar to
each other and no incongruence was detected between the

nuclear and mitochondrial topologies (Figure 1), according to the criteria defined in the Material and Methods section. Further, there was usually strong congruence for
nodal support among the different methods. Most of the
nodes present in the 50% majority-rule consensus tree
resulting from the Bayesian analyses performed on the
concatenated data set (partitioned by gene and codon
position- 14 partitions-, -ln = 32195.91, Figure 2) were
very well supported in the parsimony analyses too (two
equally most parsimonious trees, 6340 steps, CI = 0.44, RI
= 0.62).
The African species O. ireneae was recovered as the sistertaxon of all remaining Otus sensu stricto scops-owls. All the
western Indian Ocean taxa clustered in a clade that also
contains the Eurasian O. scops, the São Tomé endemic O.
hartlaubi, the Pemba Island endemic O. pembaensis, the

African mainland O. senegalensis, the Philippine taxa O.
mirus and O. longicornis, as well as the Indo-Malayan O.
sunia. The western Indian Ocean taxa were not recovered
as a monophyletic lineage since the Seychelles O. insularis
was more closely related to the Indo-Malayan O. sunia
than to any other taxon occurring in the western Indian
Ocean region. Uncorrected-p mitochondrial distances
among members of the Indian Ocean taxa/O. sunia clade
range between 4.6% (between O. capnodes and O. rutilus)
and 7.0% (O. sunia and O. rutilus), with a mean of 5.3%
(s.d. = 0.7%). Most of the relationships between the
Comorian and Malagasy taxa (capnodes, mayottensis, moheliensis, pauliani, rutilus) did not receive statistical support
and short inter-nodes characterized most of the branches
among these lineages. We attribute this lack of resolution
to rapid speciation events ('hard polytomy') rather than a
lack of sufficient character sampling ('soft polytomy')

because 1) we sampled several genes with different evolutionary properties resulting in a final alignment of more
than 4300 bp and, 2) the nodes above and below the polytomy received bootstrap percentages of 70% or more or
posterior probabilities of 0.95 or greater. The remaining
Otus species clustered in a second large clade. Within this
latter clade, O. lettia ussuriensis (eastern Russia) did not
cluster with another O. lettia sample from Laos, but with
the Philippine taxon O. megalotis, suggesting that further
work with more complete geographic sampling is needed
to address the evolutionary history of the O. lettia/O. megalotis species complex.
Dating analyses
The biogeographic history inferred from the topology of
the concatenated analyses is intriguing as several faunistic
exchanges involving the Indian Ocean islands and IndoMalaya region occurred (split O. mirus-O. longicornis from
the Indian Ocean taxa and split between O. insularis and
O. sunia). These faunistic exchanges imply either multiple
colonization events of the western Indian Ocean islands
or one re-colonization of the mainland by O. sunia, about
0.25–0.30 mya. The main radiation of western Indian
Ocean island taxa (2.5 mya, 95% HPD = 1.2–4.0 Table 1)
occurred soon after the initial colonization event (3.6
mya, 95% HPD = 1.8–6.0). Our analyses revealed that O.
hartlaubi, endemic to the African Atlantic island of São
Tomé, and O. pembaensis, restricted to Pemba Island off
the east African coast, have strong affinities with the African mainland species O. senegalensis. A very close relationship between O. senegalensis and O. pembaensis is further
supported by the fact that these two taxa share a one
nucleotide insertion in the TGFB2 locus. The position of
O. harlaubi in the mitochondrial and concatenated tree
renders this insertion paraphyletic. Yet, it is worth noting
that the two alleles of O. senegalensis differ in length at this
site. Considering that the first colonizers of São Tomé and
Pemba were probably in small numbers when compared
to the continental and widely distributed O. senegalensis,
we regard the discrepancy between the mitochondrial and
nuclear trees as being due to the different effective popuTable 1: Posterior distribution of divergence times for some

Discussion
Phylogeny of Otus sensu stricto
Previous studies [18,20] highlighted that several species
usually assigned to Otus (Ptilopsis leucotis, Megascops) are
not directly related to Otus. Our analyses, using independent samples and additional genes, confirmed the lack of
direct relationships among these three lineages. Given
that these results were previously suggested, we do not discuss them further.

Our analyses based on nuclear and mitochondrial
sequence data provide the first phylogenetic hypothesis
on the diversification of Otus sensu stricto. We suggest that
Otus consists of at least three primary lineages. The first
lineage consists of the 'relictual' Sokoke Scops-owl (O. ireneae), endemic to the coastal forests of Kenya and Tanzania. This species is sometimes considered to form a
superspecies with the patchily distributed Sandy Scopsowl (O. icterorhynchus) [22], the only African Otus species
we were not able to sample.
The second major lineage is restricted to South-East Asia
and consists of O. spilocephalus, the O. bakkamoena-O. lettia-O. lempiji superspecies, as well as Otus lettia ussuriensis
and O. megalotis. As inferred from our results, the current
taxonomy within this group appears to be problematic as
O. lettia lettia and O. l. ussuriensis are not recovered as sister-taxa. O. l. ussuriensis, restricted to Sakhalin, Ussuriland
and North-East China, is sometimes considered to be
related to the Japanese Scops-owl (O. semitorques), based
on voice, plumage and iris color data [22]. We could not
include the latter species in the present work, but highlight here that this relationship needs to be further tested
using molecular data.
The third major lineage includes all the remaining Otus
species we sampled and is divided in two subclades that
consist of 1) O. scops, O. senegalensis, O. hartlaubi and O.
pembaensis, and 2) O. longicornis, O. mirus, O. mayottensis,
O. rutilus, O. capnodes, O. moheliensis, O. pauliani, O. insularis and O. sunia. Relationships among these taxa are discussed below.
Phylogeny and origin of the western Indian Ocean Otus
Data accumulated in recent years on the biology and distribution of the western Indian Ocean scops-owls [26-29]
together with our analyses based on DNA sequences of six

loci, shed new light on the evolutionary history of these
birds. The phylogeny we propose here is in full agreement
with recent work based on phenotypic characters suggesting that O. pauliani, O. capnodes, O. moheliensis and O.
mayottensis represent distinct evolutionary lineages
[25,28,29]. In addition we find good support for Asian
biogeographic affinities of the western Indian Ocean
islands Otus spp., and highlight that they may constitute a
paraphyletic assemblage.
The Indo-Malayan O. sunia formed a well-supported clade
with O. insularis from the granitic Seychelles, which was
very closely related to the Indian Ocean lineage, the latter
forming a sequentially paraphyletic assemblage. The
nested position of O. sunia/O. insularis within the Malagasy-Comorian clade, supported by a posterior probability of 0.98 (but not by MP bootstrap percentage), suggests
a recent re-colonization of the mainland from an islanddistributed ancestor. Yet, we also acknowledge that posterior probabilities could be misleading when short internodes/polytomies are involved [33], which is the case
here, and we await the implementations of reversiblejump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms to explore
these aspects [33].
It is also worth noting that in a similar biogeographic
comparison of a different group of birds, non-monophyly
of western Indian Ocean taxa was also retrieved by Warren
et al. [13]; the Indo-Malayan bulbul Hypsipetes madagascariensis was nested within the western Indian Ocean taxa,
suggesting a similar scenario to the one we present for
Otus. Colonization of the mainland from an island distributed ancestor is generally regarded as unlikely
because: 1) mainland taxa are considered more competitive than island taxa and, 2) insular populations are
smaller and produce fewer emigrants compared to those
on continents [34,35]. However, empirical cases of continental re-colonization from islands are accumulating
[16,36-38], including cases from Madagascar [39]; this
suggests that islands can also act as colonization sources
for continental faunas. Data on the phylogeographic
structure within the Indo-Malaya O. sunia complex may
help to decipher which hypothesis (multiple colonizations of the Indian Ocean islands or re-colonization of the
mainland) best explains the current pattern. Indeed, if
strong and ancient phylogeographic structure occurs
within O. sunia, we would expect two independent colonizations of the western Indian Ocean islands. In contrast,
if genetic data indicate weak differentiation among O.
sunia populations and patterns of population expansion
from western to eastern Indo-Malaya, this would support
the hypothesis of re-colonization of the mainland from
the Seychelles Islands.

Vocalisations as a tool to infer evolutionary relationships
among scops-owls
The genus Otus is fairly homogeneous in plumage relative
to many bird genera. However, the Indian Ocean taxa
show strong differences from each other in structural,
plumage and vocal characters [26,28]. Considering, for
example, only the songs of the Comorian taxa (which
inhabit islands as close as 50 km from each other), O.
pauliani gives a very long series of chaw notes repeated at
about 2/sec; O. moheliensis a sequence of hisses; O. capnodes a high-pitched whistled peeooee; and O. mayottensis a
series usually of 3–11 deep, single hoots. Intuitively, these
differences may be used to argue against close evolutionary relationships; however, our data indicate that the relationship is indeed close in all cases, as could be predicted
from the islands' proximity to one another. This study
confirms that the vocal and morphological differences are
indeed associated with distinct evolutionary lineages, but
suggests that they are not related in any simple or obvious
way to the evolutionary distance between these lineages,
and therefore must be used with caution in identifying
affinities between taxa (or lineages). Therefore, we highlight here that the close relationship suggested by Marshall [24] between O. insularis and O. magicus should be
further tested using molecular data, especially if we consider the considerable distance between the two areas
(over 6000 km).
Comparison with the biogeographic history of other avian
lineages that colonised the Indian Ocean islands
The geographic and temporal origins of certain western
Indian Ocean island bird taxa have received attention in
recent years [e.g. [5,9,10,13,16,40-45] this study] (Table
2).

Our estimate (3.6 mya, 95% HPD: 1.8–6.0) for the timing
of colonization of the Indian Ocean islands by Otus coincides with estimates of at least seven other lineages of
birds (Table 2), suggesting that the Indian Ocean islands
avifauna was highly enriched at that time. The period
associated with these multiple independent colonizations
corresponds with the emergence of the volcanic islands of
the Comoros archipelago (Mohéli 5 mya, Anjouan 11.5–
3.9 mya, Mayotte 11.5–7.7 mya and Grande Comore 0.5
mya; [50,51], thus providing possible stepping stones for
dispersal between Africa and Madagascar. This possibility
is also highlighted by the fact that several species or populations with African biogeographic affinities (Streptopelia
capicola, Turtur tympanistria, Turdus bewsheri) [53-55], colonized the Comoros islands but the colonization of
Madagascar has not yet been achieved.
All faunal exchanges that unambiguously involve Madagascar and Indo-Malaya, or Madagascar and the Seychelles
occurred during the last 3.5 mya [[13,49], this study]

(note that the biogeographic history of the Philepittinae,
Vangidae and the Sturnidae genus Hartlaubia are still
uncertain or ambiguous). Warren et al. [48] hypothesised
for members of the genus Zosterops that the colonizations
could have been favored by dramatic sea-level shifts that
occurred during the last 2.5 mya, which would have
allowed the emergence of currently submerged landmasses between the Seychelles and Madagascar [56-58],
implying a 'stepping-stone' model. Our divergence dates
estimates are slightly older than those of Warren et al.
[49], although confidence intervals are largely overlapping. This biogeographic hypothesis fits the three unambiguous described cases involving Madagascar and Indo-

Malaya, or Madagascar and the Seychelles (Hypsipetes,
Otus and the Zosterops borbonicus lineage).
Subfossil remains of three extinct small owl species have
been described from the Mascarene Islands (La Réunion,
Mauritius, Rodrigues). Based on certain osteological features, these three species have been included in their own
genus, Mascarenotus, which has been suggested to be
derived from Otus [59]. The relationships of Mascarenotus
with respect to the other owl lineages still needs clarification, as this genus could represent a recent and derived
off-shot of the western Indian Ocean lineage, possibly a
first off-shot of the colonization process from the Sey-

chelles to more westerly regional islands or even an unrelated lineage of owls.
Whereas the continental biogeographic affinities of certain western Indian Ocean island bird taxa seem largely
resolved, the timing of colonizations or faunal affinities
among volcanic islands are less well understood and the
only aspect that is emerging is the absence of a common
pattern, whatever the initial geographic origin. Indeed, all
the studies that have been conducted so far indicate explosive diversification and a lack of resolution among the
Comoros islands species. These data indicate that once the
initial colonization was successful on any of the islands in
this archipelago, dispersion and then diversification
between nearby islands occurred quickly and randomly.
The lack of biogeographic structure at the archipelago
scale may thus be partly explained by the geographical
arrangement of islands and the short inter-islands distances (maximum distance between two islands in the
Comoros archipelago is 90 km) that probably favored colonization by alternative routes.
One final factor that could hide common patterns of
diversification is unequal rates of extinction and recolonization across lineages. Indeed, not all lineages would face
the same risk of extinction on islands as their characteristics (ecological requirements, population size) often considerably differ. For example, middle-sized birds, like
owls (70–120 g), may be more prone to extinction on
islands than small birds, like sunbirds (12–15 g) [60]. Yet,
even if uneven extinctions rates occurred amongst these
lineages, it can be concluded that the overall diversification pattern in the Indian Ocean islands is star-like.

Conclusion
Our analyses revealed the occurrence of multiple synchronous colonization events of the Indian Ocean islands by
scops-owls, at a time when faunistic exchanges involving
Madagascar was common as a result of lowered sea-level
that would have allowed the formation of stepping-stone
islands. Patterns of diversification that emerged from the
scops-owls data are: 1) a star-like pattern concerning the
order of colonization of the Indian Ocean islands and 2)
the high genetic distinctiveness among all Indian Ocean
taxa, reinforcing their recognition as distinct species.

Methods
Taxonomic sampling
We obtained tissue samples from all western Indian
Ocean Otus taxa, as well as samples from several IndoMalayan and Afrotropical species (Table 3), focusing on
as many super-species complexes as possible (sensu [22]).
We obtained tissues for seven of these super-species complexes. We were unable to obtain samples of the distinctive O. rufescens and O. sagittatus, as well as representatives

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/197

of four super-species with localised and distant distributions relative to the western Indian Ocean (brooki/angelinae from Sumatra/Java/Borneo; mantananensis/magicus
from the Lesser Sundas/Philippines/Mollucas; collari/
manadensis/beccarii from Sangihe/Sulawesi/Biak and
enganensis/alius/umbra from islands off Sumatra). Since
the monograph of Marks et al. [22], one further Otus species, O. thilohoffmani has been described from Sri Lanka
[61]. This species is only known in museum collections by
the type specimen, deposited in the National Museum
Colombo (Sri Lanka), and based on morphology, has
been suggested to be related to either O. rufescens or O. spilocephalus [61]. As a consequence, we did not have access
to a tissue sample of this newly described species. With
the exception of O. magicus, considered by some authors
to include O. insularis because of similarities in vocalizations [24], none of the species we were unable to sample
have been considered closely related to the Indian Ocean
taxa [22]. We included two individuals per color morph
for O. rutilus (sensu [23]). Representatives of the Strigidae
genera Aegolius, Athene and Glaucidium (Surniinae), Asio
(Asioninae), and Bubo, Strix, New World 'Otus'
(Megascops) and the African White-faced Owl ('Otus' Ptilopsis leucotis) (Striginae) were included as proximate outgroups. We rooted our trees using sequences from a
representative of the Tytonidae (Barn Owl Tyto alba),
which has been recovered as the sister-group of the Strigidae in molecular and morphological analyses [62,63].
Laboratory procedure
Total DNA was extracted from frozen, EDTA or alcohol
preserved tissues (liver, blood, feathers, muscle) using a
CTAB-based protocol [64] with an overnight Proteinase K
(0,1 mg.ml-1) digestion. ND2, ATP6 and ND3 were
amplified and sequenced using primer pairs L5219/
H6313 [65], L9245/H9947 [66] and L10755/H11151
[67], respectively. A 900 bp portion of cytochrome-b was
amplified with the primer pairs L14967-H15487 and
L15424-H15916 [23]). Myoglobin intron-2 and TGFB2
intron-5 were amplified with primers Myo2/Myo3F
[68,69] and tgf5/tgf6 [70], respectively. The amplification
and sequencing protocol were standard [23].
Phylogenetic analyses
Molecular phylogenies were estimated using parsimony
(P) and model-based approaches (maximum likelihood
[ML], and Bayesian inferences [BI]), as implemented in
PHYML v2.4 [71] and MRBAYES 3.1 [72-74]. Parsimony
analyses were conducted with PAUP v4.0b10 [75] using
the heuristic tree bisection and reconnection branchswapping (TBR) algorithm with 100 random addition
replicates. Likelihood models were estimated with
MRMODELTEST 2.0 [76] using the Akaike Information Criterion [77]. The selected models are listed in Table 4.

MP analyses was assessed by 1000 non-parametric bootstrap replicates [78]. The six gene regions sequenced differ
considerably in their properties and substitution dynamics, as inferred from the parameters of the models (Table
4). Consequently, analyses of concatenated data set were
only performed using a mixed-model strategy. The relevance of partitioning the data set by gene and/or codon
position was assessed with the Bayes Factor (BF) [79,80].
Fourteen partitions (myoglobin intron-2, TGFB2 intron5, first, second and third codon position of each of the
four mitochondrial genes) were considered for the Bayesian concatenated analyses according to the functional
properties of the markers. Bayesian analyses for the concatenated data set were performed allowing base frequencies, rate matrix, shape parameter and proportion of
invariable sites to vary between the partitions (using the
unlink and prset commands). Between four and six incrementally heated Metropolis-coupled MCMC chains were
run for 15 million generations with trees sampled every
100 generations. The first 2*106 generations (20000 trees)
were discarded ('burn-in' period) and the posterior probabilities were estimated from the remaining sampled generations. The default temperature for chain heating (T =
0.2) resulted in not satisfactorily mixing among chains for
the concatenated data set; we therefore lowered the temperature to T = 0.05, which resulted in swap frequencies
between chains within the 20–70% interval. Two independent Bayesian runs initiated from random starting

trees were performed for each data set, and the log-likelihood values and posterior probabilities were checked to
ascertain that the chains had reached convergence. We
also checked that the Potential Scale Reduction Factor
(PSRF) approached 1.0 for all parameters and that the
average standard deviation of split frequencies converged
towards zero. We detected significant incongruence
between the individual gene trees by comparing the topologies and nodal support obtained under different analytical methods (ML, BI). Criteria for incongruence were set
at 70% for the bootstrap values [81], and at 0.95 for posterior probabilities [72].
Molecular dating analyses
Owls have a very rich fossil record [22,82], yet, the taxonomic history of most of these taxa remains controversial
and, to our knowledge, no cladistic analyses including
fossil and modern taxa has been conducted to date. This
hampers the use of most of these fossils as calibration
points in our analyses. The family Strigidae is usually
divided into three subfamilies or tribes: Striginae, Surniinae and Asioninae [21]. These three subfamilies are
defined by a combination of shared characters [[82] fide
[83]]. The least inclusive of these three subfamilies, the
Asioninae, consists of three genera and nine species (two
of the genera, Pseudoscops and Nesasio are endemic to
Jamaica and the Solomon Islands, respectively, whereas
Asio is widely distributed). The Asionae differ osteologi-

cally from other owls by having: 1) the anterior rim of the
internal trochlea not protruding more anteriorly than the
anterior rim of the external trochlea, 2) the external calcaneal ridge bent posteriorly, 3) bony loop broad and 4)
tubercle for Musculus tibialis antiquus displaced externally [83]. The most ancient fossil having this combination of characters Intulula tinnipara, has been dated from
the Early Miocene (23.7–16.4 mya) [84]. We therefore
used this date as a minimum age for the split between Asio
otus (the member of the Asioninae we sampled) and its
closest relative. As a second calibration point, we used the
split between O. pauliani (endemic to Grande Comore, a
volcanic island) and its closest relative at 0.5 mya. This
date corresponds to the emergence of Grande Comore
[51], and is thus the oldest possible age for the colonization of the O. pauliani lineage. We used these two calibration points in combination.
We used BEAST V1.4.6 [85-87] to estimate the divergence
dates within the genus Otus. We assigned the best fitting
model, as estimated by MRMODELTEST2, to each of the six
loci. We used an exponential distribution for the fossil calibration bound [88]. We set the lower bound of the exponential distribution to 16.4 mya, which correspond to the
lowest bound of the Early Miocene epoch and the expo-

nential mean to 2.5, so that the 95% distribution probability fell within the 23.7–16.4 mya interval,
corresponding to the Early Miocene, which is the epoch
for the first Asioninae fossil. For the geological calibration
point (emergence of Grande Comore), we used a normal
distribution with the mean and standard deviation set to
0.5 mya and 0.1 mya, respectively. We assumed a Yule
Speciation Process for the tree prior and an Uncorrelated
Lognormal distribution for the molecular clock model
[86]. We used default prior distributions for all other
parameters and ran MCMC chains for 75 million generations, as the effective sample size for some parameter estimates was not large enough using the default length (10
million generations).
