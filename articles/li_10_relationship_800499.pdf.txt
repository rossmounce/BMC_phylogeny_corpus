Abstract
Background: In rice, the GW2 gene, found on chromosome 2, controls grain width and weight. Two homologs of
this gene, ZmGW2-CHR4 and ZmGW2-CHR5, have been found in maize. In this study, we investigated the
relationship, evolutionary fate and putative function of these two maize genes.
Results: The two genes are located on duplicated maize chromosomal regions that show co-orthologous
relationships with the rice region containing GW2. ZmGW2-CHR5 is more closely related to the sorghum
counterpart than to ZmGW2-CHR4. Sequence comparisons between the two genes in eight diverse maize inbred
lines revealed that the functional protein domain of both genes is completely conserved, with no nonsynonymous polymorphisms identified. This suggests that both genes may have conserved functions, a hypothesis
that was further confirmed through linkage, association, and expression analyses. Linkage analysis showed that
ZmGW2-CHR4 is located within a consistent quantitative trait locus (QTL) for one-hundred kernel weight (HKW).
Association analysis with a diverse panel of 121 maize inbred lines identified one single nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) in the promoter region of ZmGW2-CHR4 that was significantly associated with kernel width (KW) and HKW
across all three field experiments examined in this study. SNPs or insertion/deletion polymorphisms (InDels) in
other regions of ZmGW2-CHR4 and ZmGW2-CHR5 were also found to be significantly associated with at least one
of the four yield-related traits (kernel length (KL), kernel thickness (KT), KW and HKW). None of the polymorphisms
in either maize gene are similar to each other or to the 1 bp InDel causing phenotypic variation in rice. Expression
levels of both maize genes vary over ear and kernel developmental stages, and the expression level of ZmGW2CHR4 is significantly negatively correlated with KW.
Conclusions: The sequence, linkage, association and expression analyses collectively showed that the two maize
genes represent chromosomal duplicates, both of which function to control some of the phenotypic variation for
kernel size and weight in maize, as does their counterpart in rice. However, the different polymorphisms identified
in the two maize genes and in the rice gene indicate that they may cause phenotypic variation through different
mechanisms.

Background
The genetic improvement of grain yield in major cereals
has traditionally been one of the most important contributions to an increased global food supply. Gains via
phenotypic selection have been steady but slow over the
years, and the ever-growing world population makes it

necessary to increase the rate of gain in grain yields
over what has been achieved in the past. Grain size and
weight are important components of grain yield, but the
genetic basis of these traits in maize (Zea mays), one of
the most important global food staples, is insufficiently
understood. To date, several loci have been shown to
affect maize kernel development through mutant analysis [1-5], but only one gene (GS3) has been found to
affect kernel size and weight in a natural population of
maize [6]. With the successful completion of the B73

genome sequencing project, more than 32,000 genes
have been identified [7]; this provides a good opportunity for QTL cloning and function verification. However,
the identification of genes related to grain yield is still a
great challenge because of complexity of this trait. QTLs
cloned to date suggest that genes with various functions
can affect grain yield, including genes involved in protein degradation [8,9], hormone metabolism [10,11], and
other processes [12,13]. So many genetic factors affect
final grain yield that it has even been suggested that the
entire genome may be involved [14].
Comparative QTL mapping studies have shown that
some QTL for many traits, including grain yield, are
located on collinear chromosomes in different species
[15-18]. This suggests that mutations in orthologous
genes contribute to similar trait variation. If the current,
similar function of the genes was gained following divergence of the different species being compared, the mutations will be completely independent, and may be
dissimilar in nature. This has been seen in the wellknown “green revolution” genes Rht in wheat, GAI in
Arabidopsis and Dwarf8 in maize, which all contribute
to short plant stature [19].
The availability of the rice genomic sequences [20,21]
facilitated the identification of many genes controlling
grain size and weight [9,22-25]. The GW2 gene was the
first gene controlling grain width to be cloned in rice. It
encodes a RING-type protein with E3 ubiquitin ligase
activity, and functions as a negative regulator of grain
width and weight. A 1 bp deletion in the fourth exon
resulting in a premature stop codon and a truncation of
310 amino acids causes the increase in rice grain width
and weight [9]. Only one copy of GW2 exists in rice,
but a search of the latest B73 genomic sequence identified two homologous gene sequences [7]. Whether both
maize genes represent co-orthologs of the rice GW2
gene has not been tested. Besides, based on the conserved function found for various other genes, it is reasonable to suppose that the maize orthologs of rice
GW2 may also affect grain size and weight, which needs
to be tested further.
Association analysis can identify genetic polymorphisms that are associated with phenotypic variation. Compared with linkage analysis, it is time- and cost-effective.
More importantly, it can investigate more than two
alleles at the same time and can reach extraordinarily
high resolution in species with rapid linkage disequilibrium (LD) decay [26]. Maize contains abundant genetic
diversity and LD decays within 2 kb in diverse material
[27-29]. This rapid LD decay pattern makes maize an
ideal plant for association analysis to identify causal
polymorphisms or closely linked polymorphisms, which
can then be used to develop functional markers for marker-assisted selection [30]. To date, association analysis

has been widely used in maize to dissect the genetic
basis of complex traits, such as kernel carotenoid content [30], kernel starch content [31], kernel quality traits
[32] and flowering time [33].
The objectives of this study were to clarify the relationship of the two maize genes that were found to be
homologous to the rice GW2 gene; to investigate their
evolutionary fate following the duplication of these
genes in maize; and to characterize the contribution and
putative function of these two genes in maize grain
yield-related traits.

Results
The rice GW2 gene has two co-orthologs located on
duplicated chromosomes in maize

Blast searches with the rice GW2 protein sequence
[GenBank: ABO31101] against the maize high throughput genomic sequence database [34] identified two
maize bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones,
AC212189 on chromosome 4 and AC211190 on chromosome 5, that contain sequences showing high similarity to the rice protein. The structures of these two genes
were determined using three maize complementary
DNA (cDNA) clones from GenBank, EU968771,
FJ573211 and EU962093, which showed high sequence
similarity to the two BAC clones. Both genes consist of
eight exons, with an overall sequence similarity of 94%
to each other and 93% to the rice GW2 gene across the
coding region. They were named ZmGW2-CHR4 and
ZmGW2-CHR5, based on their locations on the maize
chromosomes (See additional file 1: Similarity between
ZmGW2-CHR4 and ZmGW2-CHR5 across the cDNA
region).
Because the maize genome has been shown to be
replete with duplicated chromosomal regions [7,35], we
investigated if the two homologs represent duplicated
genes. As shown in Figure 1A, other gene sequences in
the vicinity of the two maize genes also show high similarity, as would arise following an ancient chromosome
duplication event. Comparison of the regions around
both maize genes with the region containing rice GW2
showed that both maize regions are collinear with the
rice region, indicating that the two maize genes are coorthologs of the rice GW2 gene. Besides, compared to
the rice region containing GW2, both maize regions
contain an inversion (Figure 1A).
Phylogenetic analysis of the duplicated maize genes
and their corresponding counterparts in sorghum, rice
and barley showed that ZmGW2-CHR5 is more closely
related to the sorghum counterpart than to the other
maize copy (Figure 1B), indicating that sequence divergence has occurred between the two maize genes. To
identify the fixed polymorphic sites between the maize
genes, we sequenced the coding regions of both genes

QTL (Figure 2A; Table 2). This QTL was identified stably across four seasons and explained 3.2% to 6.9% of
the phenotypic variation in the IF2 population derived
from inbred lines Zong3 and 87-1. The Zong3 allele can
increase HKW from 0.5 to 1.3 g (Table 2). Although the
large QTL confidence interval (10.4 ~ 18.7 cM) contained lots of genes, the involvement of GW2 in HKW
in rice and the co-location of ZmGW2-CHR4 with this
QTL indicated that ZmGW2-CHR4 is a good candidate
for this QTL and may be involved in grain weight
variation.

in eight diverse maize lines belonging to five heterotic
groups. In total, we found 70 fixed sites, of which 44
were synonymous mutations (Table 1). All polymorphisms but two were SNPs. The 70 sites are not evenly
distributed across the entire coding region, as 60% of
the polymorphisms occurred in exon 8, and no polymorphisms were found in exon 2 (Table 1). Only three
SNPs were found in the RING domain, all of which
were synonymous mutations, suggesting that this
domain may have a conserved function in both genes.
ZmGW2-CHR4 is located within a QTL for HKW

ZmGW2-CHR4 and ZmGW2-CHR5 were located in
maize chromosomal bins 4.09 and 5.04, respectively.
Previous studies have mapped many QTL for kernel
weight to these two regions (See additional file 2: QTL
for grain yield mapped in previous studies in maize bins
4.09 and 5.04). In particular, in an F2:3 population [37]
and an immortalized F2 (IF2) population developed by
our lab at the China Agricultural University [40,41], a
QTL for HKW was mapped to bin 4.09 (Figure 2A;
Table 2). ZmGW2-CHR4 was mapped to 248 cM on
chromosome 4, between simple sequence repeat (SSR)
markers bnlg292 and umc1173, and within the QTL
confidence interval for HKW, near the left border of the

Genetic diversity and LD of the two genes across maize
inbred lines

The genetic diversity within the RING domain was not
analyzed because it is well conserved across the two
maize genes (Table 1). Instead, we analyzed three
regions of comparable sizes in corresponding regions of
the two maize genes (Figure 3; Figure 4). The average
levels of nucleotide diversity (π) in the two genes are
comparable, both having about 4 nucleotide differences
per 1,000 sites between two random sequences across
the entire genes (Table 3). However, the nucleotide
diversity is not evenly distributed across both genes.
While the 5’ end showed the most abundant diversity in

ZmGW2-CHR4. The triangle represents site S40 (see details in Table 5).

ZmGW2-CHR4 (π = 7.7 × 10-3), this region showed the
fewest polymorphisms in ZmGW2-CHR5 (π = 2.6 × 10-3).
The middle portion of ZmGW2-CHR4 has only two
polymorphisms, while the corresponding region of
ZmGW2-CHR5 has 28 polymorphisms and the highest
level of genetic diversity. Tajima’s D statistic was calculated to determine whether the two genes were subjected
to selective constraints. As shown in Table 3, it appears
that neither gene has been the subject of natural selection when the entire gene sequences were analyzed.
Because the selection effect may not extend throughout
the entire gene [42], we calculated Tajima’s D statistic

separately for the three regions in each gene. The results
showed that the middle portion of ZmGW2-CHR4
(Figure 3) has a significant positive Tajima’s D value, suggesting the presence of selection at this region, which is
consistent with the observed low level of nucleotide
diversity (Table 3).
The LD decay patterns of the two genes shown in Figures 3 and 4 indicate that both genes contain discrete
LD blocks. In ZmGW2-CHR4, a large LD block was
observed at the 5’ end (Figure 3), and in ZmGW2CHR5, a large LD block was observed in the middle portion (Figure 4). The only two polymorphisms in the

middle portion of ZmGW2-CHR4 are in complete LD;
thus, only two haplotypes were observed (Table 3;
Figure 3), consistent with the observed selection and
reduced nucleotide diversity in this region. Although LD
extends in each of the three regions in both genes (less
than 800 bp), LD among the three regions within both
genes was within 2,000 bp (Figure 3; Figure 4), consistent with previous results [27-29]. We further investigated LD between the two genes, only 1.4% of r2 values
for all pairs of polymorphisms was greater than 0.10,
and the largest r2 was less than 0.16.
Association analysis of four yield-related traits

Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed significant phenotypic variation for all four yield-related traits among
the maize lines studied (Table 4), indicating that the
assembled panel is suitable for association analysis. A
significant year by genotype effect was observed for all
four traits. The phenotypic distributions ranged from
6.48 to 11.58 mm for KL, 5.65 to 10.57 mm for KW,
3.14 to 6.73 mm for KT and 7.87 to 42.86 g for HKW;
with an average of 8.90 mm, 8.12 mm, 4.70 mm and
22.50 g, respectively (Table 4). Significant positive

phenotypic and genetic correlations between KW and
KT, and between kernel size traits (KL, KW and KT)
and HKW were observed (Table 4), indicating that an
increase in any of the three kernel size traits can
increase HKW, and thus perhaps grain yield.
The mixed model controlling for population structure
(Q) and kinship (K) as estimated using molecular markers [43] was employed to test associations between the
four yield-related traits and polymorphisms from the
two maize genes. Out of 360 (30 sites × 4 traits × 3
years) and 612 possible associations (51 sites × 4 traits ×
3 years), 81 and 49 associations were significant for
ZmGW2-CHR4 and ZmGW2-CHR5, respectively, at P ≤
0.05; while at P ≤ 0.01, 33 and 22 associations remained
significant, indicating that the observed associations
were not expected only by chance.
Taking the LD (r 2 > 0.8) level among sites into
account, seven and five sites from ZmGW2-CHR4 and
ZmGW2-CHR5, respectively, were significantly associated with at least one of the four yield-related traits at
P ≤ 0.01. Information on the location, genotype, frequency and probability value for each site can be found
in Tables 5 and 6. The S40 site from ZmGW2-CHR4

was of great interest because it showed associations with

5), and explained 8.0% and 11.4% of the phenotypic variation for KW and HKW, respectively in Beijing in 2007.
This site also segregated in the IF 2 population and
mapped to a region where a QTL for HKW was identified (Figure 2B). Three other sites from ZmGW2-CHR4
(S27, S304 and S1730) and one site from ZmGW2CHR5 (S1789) were significantly associated with KW in
two out of the three field experiments; and sites S628
from ZmGW2-CHR4 and S1632 from ZmGW2-CHR5
showed significant effects on KT in two out of the three

in this study were significant in only one field experiment and could not be repeated across years and locations (Table 5; Table 6).

the IF2 population (Figure 2; Table 2). Of the seven significant polymorphisms associated with HKW from
ZmGW2-CHR4, four segregated in the IF 2 population
and could be tested. In the association panel, all four
favourable alleles are from the inbred line 87-1 (Table
5), while in the IF2 population, the allele that increases

HKW is from the other parent, Zong3 (Table 2). For
ZmGW2-CHR5, we did not detect any QTL for HKW
in its vicinity in the IF2 population. Consistent with this
result, the only polymorphism that showed significant
association with HKW in the association panel did not
segregate in the IF2 population (Table 6).

Expression analyses of the two maize genes

Real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRTPCR) of 12 different tissues was performed to address
whether the two maize genes had diverged expression
patterns and whether these patterns were associated
with a role in kernel development. As shown in Figure
5A, expression trends of the two genes were quite similar, with a correlation coefficient of 0.84, indicating no
divergence between the two genes in the tissues examined. The highest expression levels were observed in
immature ears for both genes, and expression levels
were reduced in kernels after pollination, suggesting a
role in kernel development. Correlation analysis between
the expression levels of the two genes and the four traits
across 41 maize inbred lines showed that ZmGW2CHR4 transcript abundance was negatively correlated
with KW (Figure 5B, N = 41, P = 0.03, R2 = 0.12). However, despite the correlation between KW and the
expression level of ZmGW2-CHR4, and the association
between KW and six ZmGW2-CHR4 polymorphisms
(Table 5), none of these polymorphisms affected the
expression level of ZmGW2-CHR4. No significant correlations were observed between ZmGW2-CHR5 transcript
levels and any of the four traits.

Discussion
Evolution of the two maize genes

The collinear relationship between the rice region containing GW2 and the maize regions containing
ZmGW2-CHR4 and ZmGW2-CHR5 suggested that the
two maize genes are duplicated genes and both of them
are co-orthologs of rice GW2 (Figure 1A). Previous studies consistently showed that maize has a segmental
allotetraploid origin, in which the maize genome was
thought to have arisen through hybridization of two
ancestral diploids whose genomes had partially diverged,
one of which shares a more recent common ancestor
with the sorghum genome [44,45]. To clarify the relationship of the GW2 genes in maize and sorghum, we
performed phylogenetic analysis with the GW2 protein
sequences, which showed that ZmGW2-CHR5 is more
closely related to its counterpart in sorghum than to
ZmGW2-CHR4 (Figure 1B). This finding supports the
segmental allotetraploid origin of maize, and indicates
that the two maize genes may have evolved independently for a period of time [44,45].
Three processes have been proposed to explain the
evolutionary fates of duplicated genes within a species:
non-functionalization, neo-functionalization and subfunctionalization. In non-functionalization, one of the
duplicates accumulates deleterious mutations and eventually degenerates to a pseudogene or is lost from the
genome [46-48]. Occasionally, mutations in regulatory
or coding regions can lead to novel gene function (neo-

Page 9 of 15

functionalization) [48,49]. Alternatively, both genes may
experience some degeneration and lose partial functionality, but can complement each other (sub-functionalization). This can occur through partition of either protein
domains or regulatory elements of the ancestral gene
[50-52]. Sequence analyses showed that ZmGW2-CHR4
and ZmGW2-CHR5 are highly conserved, with an overall similarity of 94% across the coding region. None of
the mutations in either gene led to truncated proteins,
and no non-synonymous nucleotide changes were
observed in the RING domain. Additionally, both genes
are expressed across various tissues. Thus, neither of the
genes has experienced a non-functionalization process.
To assess if neo-functionalization and sub-functionalization have occurred, previous knowledge of the ancestral gene’s function is required, which is usually
unavailable. Besides, both processes can occur through
changes in regulatory or coding regions. Therefore, we
tested and distinguished the two processes by investigating whether reciprocal degenerations have occurred. For
example, if one gene was expressed in roots and
silenced in leaves, sub-functionalization requires that the
other gene must be silenced in roots and expressed in
leaves (occurrence of reciprocal degeneration); while
neo-functionalization requires that the other gene must
be silenced in both tissues so that the expression in
roots could be assumed to be a new function. In
ZmGW2-CHR4 and ZmGW2-CHR5, the exon number,
protein length and protein domain are all well conserved (Table1; Figure 3; Figure 4), with no protein
domains lost or acquired, indicating that neo-functionalization or sub-functionalization through changes in the
coding region had not occurred. We further investigated
the expression patterns of the two genes across 12
maize tissues (Figure 5A). Although the promoter
regions of the two genes are highly divergent, both
genes were expressed in all of the 12 tissues and their
expression levels were highly correlated (r = 0.84), indicating that neither neo-functionalization nor sub-functionalization through changes in regulatory regions had
occurred in the tissues examined. However, we could
not exclude the possibility that the two genes may show
divergent expression patterns under various environmental conditions or in specific cell types which have
not been tested.
Genetic variations in ZmGW2-CHR4 and ZmGW2-CHR5 are
associated with kernel size and weight in maize

The orthologous relationship and high sequence conservation between the two maize genes and the rice GW2
suggest that ZmGW2-CHR4 and ZmGW2-CHR5 may
perform similar functions as GW2 in rice. Results from
expression, linkage and association analyses corroborate
this supposition. The expression levels of both maize

Li et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:143
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/143

genes varied according to the developmental stages of
the ear or kernel (Figure 5A), implying that they may be
involved in ear or kernel development. This was further
supported by association analysis. Although the small
size of the association mapping panel did not guarantee
optimal power of association tests [53], both genes were
found to contain polymorphisms affecting at least one
of the four yield-related traits (Table 5; Table 6). Two
more lines of evidence were presented to support a role
of ZmGW2-CHR4 in kernel size and weight. One came
from QTL mapping results (Figure 2; Table 2), which
placed ZmGW2-CHR4 within the confidence interval of
a consistent QTL for HKW. Another came from the
negative correlation between the expression levels of
ZmGW2-CHR4 and KW (Figure 5B), indicating that
down-regulation of this gene may lead to elevated KW,
and thus grain yield. This is consistent with the negative
function of GW2 in rice, where a truncated protein
leads to an increase in grain size and weight [9].
Previous study with another yield-related gene, GS3,
showed that different polymorphisms underlie similar
phenotypes in rice and maize [6]. Here, we report a
similar phenomenon. In rice, a 1 bp deletion in the
fourth exon leads to a premature truncated protein and
causes enhanced grain width and weight [9], while in
maize, mutations in other regions of ZmGW2-CHR4
and ZmGW2-CHR5 cause those phenotypes (Table 5;
Table 6). However, we cannot exclude the possibility
that the 1 bp deletion found in the rice GW2 gene also
exists in maize, and would have been found if more
(and more diverse) lines are sequenced for these genes.
Moreover, the genetic polymorphisms that were associated with phenotypic variation for kernel size and
weight are different between the two maize genes, indicating that they probably affect kernel size and weight
through different mechanisms.
In QTL analysis, the favourable allele for HKW is
from the inbred line Zong3 (Table 2). In our association
panel, the favourable alleles of all four polymorphisms
that segregated in the QTL mapping population were
from the other parental inbred line, 87-1 (Table 5).
Three possible explanations may explain the discrepancy
in the direction of allelic effects. One is that the associations are false positives created due to the possible presence of population structure and individual relatedness.
The best statistical model to account for the effect of
population structure and individual relatedness and control the false positive rate is the mixed linear model
[43,53]. This was the model used in this study, with
which we found that one polymorphism was consistently associated with HKW across three different environments, and the direction of the allelic effect was the
same across these environments (Table 5). For complex
traits, such as HKW, the consistent detection of a

Page 10 of 15

significant association across various environments
using a well-performed statistical model implies that the
associations are not false positives.
A second possibility for the discrepancy is that we
may not have identified the actual functional polymorphism, but rather only one linked to it. Our evidence shows that ZmGW2-CHR4 and ZmGW2-CHR5
are associated with kernel size and weight in maize.
However, it is still unclear what the actual causal polymorphism(s) is (are) in each case because association
analysis based on LD can identify neutral polymorphisms (hereafter referred to as “the detected polymorphism”) in high LD with the actual functional
polymorphism (See additional file 3: LD between sites
significantly associated with kernel size and weight in
ZmGW2-CHR4; additional file 4: LD between sites significantly associated with kernel size and weight in
ZmGW2-CHR5). When the detected polymorphism is in
complete LD with the functional polymorphism, the
favourable allele at the detected polymorphism can
represent the favourable allele at the functional polymorphism completely. However, if recombination
occurred between the two polymorphisms, some inbred
lines would show a favourable allele at the detected
polymorphism, but actually contain the unfavourable
allele at the functional polymorphism. This cannot be
detected in association analysis where the mean effects
of all lines are measured, but can be detected in linkage
analysis where only two lines (this is, lines where recombination occurred between the functional polymorphism
and the detected polymorphism) are involved.
A third possibility is the presence of other functional
polymorphisms that we did not detect in the present
study. The interval of a QTL usually spans 10-30 cM
[54], and can contain more than one gene involved in
the expression of the same trait in some cases [10,55].
Thus, the QTL effect actually represents the combined
effect of all functional polymorphisms within the region.
In the association analysis that included Zong3 and 871, we detected favourable alleles in ZmGW2-CHR4 from
87-1, but if there were other unfavourable functional
polymorphisms in ZmGW2-CHR4 or other possible
genes within the QTL that were not measured in the
association analysis, the mean effect would identify 87-1
as the unfavourable parent in the QTL mapping population. This is quite possible, because our correlation analysis also pointed to the presence of other functional
polymorphisms. In this study, we found a significant
negative correlation between the expression levels of
ZmGW2-CHR4 and KW, but this correlation cannot be
explained by the identified significant polymorphisms in
the association analysis, implying the presence of other
causal polymorphisms. These polymorphisms could be
cis-acting elements far upstream of the genes, as in the

Li et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:143
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/143

case of tb1 [56]. Alternatively, they could be unknown
trans-acting elements hidden in the genome, as have
been reported in the maize genome [57]. However, it is
very difficult to identify upstream cis- or trans-acting
elements using the candidate gene association analysis
strategy. An alternative method to identify these elements and to further explore the genetic basis of complex quantitative traits is genome-wide association
studies with high density marker coverage [58].

Conclusions
This study investigated the relationship, evolutionary
fate and function of two maize genes involved in kernel
size and weight. The two genes represent chromosomal
duplicates that are co-orthologs of GW2 in rice. The
sequences of both genes are well conserved, with no
mutations leading to a pseudo-molecule, and no new
protein motifs were found, suggesting that both genes
may have conserved functions in maize. Expression and
candidate gene-based association analyses suggested that
both genes play a role in kernel size and weight variation, as does rice GW2. However, the identified polymorphisms that contribute to phenotypic variation are
different between the maize and rice genes and between
the two maize genes, suggesting that the three genes
may cause phenotypic variation through different
mechanisms. Mutant or transformation experiments
would shed more light on this hypothesis. The conservation of function (all associated with variation in kernel
size and weight) together with the diversification of
mechanism (different identified polymorphisms) among
the three genes can help us to understand the similarities as well as the differences in the genetic basis of
grain yield in rice and maize.
Methods
Determining the relationship between the two maize
genes

Sequences in the vicinity of the two maize genes and the
rice GW2 gene were used to generate the collinear relationships among them. Because the three regions have
different degrees of chromosomal expansion, different
lengths of sequences were used. Specifically, a stretch of
8.6 Mb on maize chromosome 4 (B73 genome, 228.4237.0 Mb), 20.9 Mb on maize chromosome 5 (B73 genome, 136.0-156.9 Mb) and 4.2 Mb on rice chromosome
2 (Oryza sativa japonica TIGR5, 5.8-10.0 Mb) were
used. The online program SyMAP v3.0 [59] was used to
draw and display the collinear relationship among the
three regions with default settings.
The homologous sequences of the rice GW2 gene
from other species, including maize, sorghum and barley, were obtained via BLAST analysis in NCBI [34] and
PlantGDB [60]. The phylogenetic tree was generated

Page 11 of 15

using MEGA, version 3.1 [61] with the neighbor-joining
method, Kimura two-parameter distance and pairwise
deletion analysis. Robustness of the constructed phylogenetic tree was tested with 1,000 bootstrap repetitions
of the informative polymorphisms.
Genetic mapping and QTL analysis

A primer pair, M9 (See additional file 5: Primers used in
this study) was designed from the sequences of
ZmGW2-CHR4 and used to map the gene in the recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from Zong3
and 87-1 [62] using MAPMAKER/EXP 3.0 [63]. The
RIL population was used to develop an IF 2 population
consisting of 441 crosses to map QTL and heterotic loci
for yield-related traits [40,41]. The IF2 genotypes were
deduced according to the marker genotypes of their RIL
parents, and the detailed method and the IF2 design can
be found in a previous study [41]. The composite interval mapping model [64] implemented in QTL Cartographer 2.5 [65] was used to map QTL for HKW in the IF2
population following addition of the M9 marker. A window size of 10 cM, 5 control markers and the forward
regression method were used. The threshold for declaring a QTL was determined by 1,000 random permutations with a significance level of 0.05.
Sequencing and analyses

Coding regions of the two genes in eight maize inbred
lines were sequenced in order to identify the fixed sites,
which were the sites showing polymorphisms between
the two maize genes but showing no variation within
each gene across a panel of diverse lines. These lines
were from the five main heterotic groups in China [66],
including three lines from the TangSPT group (K12,
Hai014 and S22), two from the Reid group (Shen5003
and 812) and one each from the Lancaster (4F1), Temptropic (SW1611) and Zi330 groups (5311). The heterotic
groups were classified according to the genetic distance
calculated using SSR markers. The genetic distance
between lines within each group is closer than between
lines from different groups. For the nucleotide diversity
and LD analyses, three segments of each gene were
sequenced, corresponding to the 5’ end, the middle portion and the 3’ end, across 121 lines with good agronomic performance among the assembled association
mapping panel consisting of 155 diverse lines [53]. The
primer pairs were designed in corresponding regions of
the two homologous genes so that comparisons between
them could be performed. Detailed information on the
primers can be found in Additional file 5: Primers used
in this study. Direct PCR products from the inbred lines
in this study, which are almost completely homozygous
across the whole genome, were sequenced. For ambiguous chromatograms, the products were sequenced again

Li et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:143
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/143

in the reverse direction, or the DNA was re-amplified
and sequencing was repeated.
After sequencing, an initial alignment was performed
with the multiple sequence alignment program MUSCLE [67] to detect singletons, which are polymorphisms
that are found only once among the sequenced materials. Lines in which singletons were found were analyzed
again until they were confirmed as correct. MUSCLE
was then used again to align the confirmed sequences,
which were subsequently refined manually in BioEdit
[68]. Three parameters implemented in the DnaSP, version 4.00 [69] were used to measure genetic diversity:
the average pairwise nucleotide difference per site - π,
the number of segregating sites - S; and the number of
haplotypes - h. Tajima’s D statistic [70] was also calculated to investigate evidence for past selection. The LD
level between sites with allelic frequency > 0.05 was calculated using TASSEL 2.0.1 [71].
Field design and statistical analyses

A maize association mapping panel with 155 diverse
inbred lines developed by Yang et al. [53] was used to
find associations between the DNA polymorphisms in
the two maize genes and grain yield components. Population structure (Q) and relative kinship (K) were
reported in a previous study [53]. Briefly, population
structure was inferred using 82 SSR markers in STRUCTURE 2.2 [72,73] with five independent runs at each k
(number of populations, which was set from 1 to 10).
Results indicated the presence of two sub-populations
[53], which were incorporated into the Q matrix. The
kinship matrix K was calculated using 884 SNP markers
in SPAGeDi [74], and negative values between individuals were set to 0 [43]. Of the 155 inbred lines, 121
lines with good agronomic performance were phenotyped in the present study. Two of the field experiments,
Beijing and Hainan in 2007, have been reported previously [6]. An additional field experiment with two
replications in Hainan was performed in 2008 using
similar field design and management as in Li et al. [6].
KL, KW, KT and HKW were measured as described by
Li et al. [6]. The analysis of variance, descriptive statistics and correlation analysis for the four yield-related
traits were performed using the SAS system (version
8.02, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Association
analysis was performed with TASSEL 2.0.1 [71] using
the mixed model, Q+K [43].
RNA extraction and qRT-PCR

Plant materials used to perform expression pattern analysis were described in a previous study [6]. Briefly,
twelve tissues were collected from the inbred line 87-1,
including seedling shoot, seedling root, mature leaf, tas-

Page 12 of 15

sel from plants with 15 expanded leaves, silk and husk
from ears 0 days after pollination (DAP), immature ears
from plants with 14 and 18 expanded leaves, and kernels
harvested at four time points after pollination (0 DAP,
10 DAP, 15 DAP and 20 DAP). In addition, kernels at 0
DAP were collected from 41 inbred lines (See additional
file 6: Materials used for correlation analysis) which
were grown in a field in Shangzhuang, Beijing in 2007
to perform correlation analysis between expression
levels and yield-related traits. TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA) and RNase-free DNase (Promega,
Madison, Wisconsin, USA) were used to prepare the
total RNA, which was then used to synthesize the
cDNA with the MMLV retro-transcriptase and an oligo
(dT) primer (Promega). qRT-PCR was performed with
the Ex Taq premix (Takara Shuzo, Kyoto, Japan) and
primers listed in Additional file 5: Primers used in this
study. These specific primers were designed based on
sequence differences between the two maize genes, so
that each primer pair will amplify only one of the genes.
All experiments were carried out following the manufacturers’ instructions. The 2 -ΔΔC T method [75] was
employed to calculate relative expression levels with the
housekeeping gene ubiquitin as an endogenous control.
Tassel and 0 DAP kernels from the inbred line 87-1
were used as the reference tissues in the expression pattern and correlation analyses, respectively. Three replicates were performed to calculate the average and
standard deviation of expression levels for each sample.
