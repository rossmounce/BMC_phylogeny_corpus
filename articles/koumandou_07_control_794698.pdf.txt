Abstract
Background: In membrane trafficking, the mechanisms ensuring vesicle fusion specificity remain to be
fully elucidated. Early models proposed that specificity was encoded entirely by SNARE proteins; more
recent models include contributions from Rab proteins, Syntaxin-binding (SM) proteins and tethering
factors. Most information on membrane trafficking derives from an evolutionarily narrow sampling of
model organisms. However, considering factors from a wider diversity of eukaryotes can provide both
functional information on core systems and insight into the evolutionary history of the trafficking
machinery. For example, the major Qa/syntaxin SNARE families are present in most eukaryotic genomes
and likely each evolved via gene duplication from a single ancestral syntaxin before the existing eukaryotic
groups diversified. This pattern is also likely for Rabs and various other components of the membrane
trafficking machinery.
Results: We performed comparative genomic and phylogenetic analyses, when relevant, on the SM
proteins and components of the tethering complexes, both thought to contribute to vesicle fusion
specificity. Despite evidence suggestive of secondary losses amongst many lineages, the tethering
complexes are well represented across the eukaryotes, suggesting an origin predating the radiation of
eukaryotic lineages. Further, whilst we detect distant sequence relations between GARP, COG, exocyst
and DSL1 components, these similarities most likely reflect convergent evolution of similar secondary
structural elements. No similarity is found between the TRAPP and HOPS complexes and the other
tethering factors. Overall, our data favour independent origins for the various tethering complexes. The
taxa examined possess at least one homologue of each of the four SM protein families; since the four
monophyletic families each encompass a wide diversity of eukaryotes, the SM protein families very likely
evolved before the last common eukaryotic ancestor (LCEA).
Conclusion: These data further support a highly complex LCEA and indicate that the basic architecture
of the trafficking system is remarkably conserved and ancient, with the SM proteins and tethering factors
having originated very early in eukaryotic evolution. However, the independent origin of the tethering
complexes suggests a novel pattern for increasing complexity in the membrane trafficking system, in
addition to the pattern of paralogous machinery elaboration seen thus far.

Background
Intracellular transport and vesicle trafficking are fundamental processes that occur in nearly all eukaryotic cells.
These processes are complex, requiring the activity of 5–
10% of the proteome in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and likely
a similar commitment in most other systems. It has been
suggested that the origin of the membrane trafficking
machinery was a key innovation for creation of the
eukaryotic cellular state [1-3], and the presence of this system clearly distinguishes modern eukaryotes from
prokaryotic organisms. Regardless of the precise mode by
which membrane transport occurs, for example vesicle
mediated or compartmental maturation models, a crucial
aspect of the membrane trafficking process is how specificity of membrane fusion is determined.
It was initially proposed that vesicle fusion compatibility
was encoded exclusively by coiled-coil SNARE proteins,
which interact directly with the general Sec18/NEM-sensitive factor fusion system [4,5]. This model required that
each transport vesicle contain a specific vesicle (V or R)SNARE protein that interacts with cognate target (T)SNAREs including the Qa-SNAREs (or syntaxins) and
additional Q-SNARE proteins, which are present in the
membrane of the target organelle. In all fusion reactions
combinatorial pairing of the SNAREs was thought to provide specificity, but recent work has shown that SNARE
pairing can be promiscuous and that additional factors,
e.g. Rab family small GTPases, the regulatory syntaxinbinding (SM) proteins, and the tethering complexes, must
also be involved [6-8]. With the exception of the tether
complexes, these various factors all share the characteristic
of being part of multigene families, and having distinct
members of the family localised to, and participating in,
transport steps at discrete subcellular compartments [9].
Analyses of SNARE [10-12] and Rab [13] sequences are
consistent with each family having evolved from an ancestral gene, which then gave rise to the major SNARE and
Rab gene families present in extant eukaryotes. As individual SNARE/Rab subfamilies are associated with distinct
subcellular organelles, the most likely interpretation is
that development of each new organelle was concurrent
with the emergence of a novel SNARE or Rab paralogue.
The gene duplications required to define the major compartments of the endomembrane system appear to have
taken place before the last common eukaryotic ancestor
(LCEA) arose; a similar model is also likely for the vesicle
coat machinery [14].
The SM proteins bind syntaxins and regulate the transSNARE-SNARE interaction. As with SNAREs and Rabs, the
SM proteins can be divided into protein subfamilies, each
of which performs a similar function but at a specific and
unique location within the cell (Figure 1). Surprisingly,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/29

although the SM proteins appear to all be derived via gene
duplication, the different SM families bind syntaxins by
distinct mechanisms [8]. Sly1p and Vps45p bind syntaxin
5 and syntaxin 16 respectively via the N-terminal domain
of the SNARE in the open confirmation. Sec1p also interacts directly with its cognate syntaxin protein, but with the
N-terminal domain of the SNARE folded over the C-terminal domain in a closed confirmation. By contrast, Vps33p
binds its cognate SNARE indirectly as a part of the HOPS
complex. These distinct modes of SNARE regulation by
SM proteins have prompted speculation about how different mechanisms can result in essentially equivalent function and how such a situation could have arisen during
evolution [15].
The tethering factors participate at the earliest stage in the
approach of a vesicle towards a target membrane. The
presence of such tethers has been suspected for some time
[16], but whilst earlier work focused on potential roles of
extended coiled-coil proteins as tethers, e.g. GM130 and
Uso1, more compelling evidence for a predominant role
for multiprotein complexes has recently emerged
(reviewed in [7,17]). Knockout studies in S. cerevisiae
[7,17,18] demonstrate stronger phenotypes for the components of many of these complexes than for the putative
coiled-coil elements. Further evidence, again mainly from
studies in S. cerevisiae, indicates interactions between
these complexes and central components of the fusion
apparatus, specifically SNAREs, Rab and ARF GTPases and
coat proteins (Figures 1 and 2). In addition, the tethering
factors may be isolated as stable complexes. Tethering
complexes have differing combinations and numbers of
subunits, with the individual complexes (COG, HOPS,
TRAPPI, TRAPPII, DSL1, exocyst and GARP) acting at distinct subcellular locations (Figures 1 and 2).
Investigating membrane trafficking in organisms beyond
the conventional experimental systems can identify conserved, presumably essential, membrane trafficking factors, as well as highlight the diversity of trafficking
pathways amongst extant eukaryotes and uncover novel
biology in specific lineages. From a combination of
molecular and morphological data, six eukaryotic supergroups are now recognized [19,20], but molecular studies
of intracellular transport systems have focused primarily
on S. cerevisiae and metazoan taxa, both members of the
Opisthokonta super-group. The relatively poor experimental tractability of many of the organisms within the
additional eukaryotic super-groups poses a considerable
challenge, but the availability of genome sequences from
some of these taxa can facilitate rapid identification of factors in such systems.
Evolutionary investigation of the membrane trafficking
machinery has revealed several features. Firstly, genomic,

Location and functions of multi-subunit tethering complexes and SM proteins in an idealised eukaryotic cell. A
generalised endomembrane system with only the major trafficking routes is shown, including the multiple recycling pathways
that intersect with the Golgi complex and various endosomal subcompartments. The locations of tethering complexes discussed in this article are shown in red and of SM proteins in green. Note that the precise location is not always clear, for example the HOPS complex is known to function in late endocytic steps, but the functional and physical subdivision of the late
endosomal population is not precise. Further, some factors may function in more than one locale. The figure is based on Figure

phylogenetic and cell biological evidence suggests that the
LCEA possessed a complex endomembrane system. The
major protein families known to be required for vesicle
formation and fusion [9,21] were present very early on in

eukaryotic evolution [22-24] and additional data support
the presence of a full complement of membrane trafficking organelles [25,26]. We previously investigated the distribution of key components of major endocytic

Composition, evolutionary conservation and general structure of tethering complexes
Composition, evolutionary conservation and general structure of tethering complexes. The individual subunits of
each of the complexes are shown as ovals, arranged according to interaction data from many sources (including pull down,
yeast two hybrid, direct structural visualisation and genetic data). For clarity, not all interactions are shown. For example, there
is evidence to support interactions between COG 1 and COGs 3 and 4 and additional interactions within the exocyst complex. Individual subunits are colour-coded for evolutionary conservation; red designates a subunit that has wide taxon distribution, whilst subunits in green are absent from multiple taxa. Interactions with factors outside of the tethering complex are
indicated in black – the line indicates the approximate interaction interface, if known. See Figure 4 and additional file 3 and the
text for full details.

trafficking pathways, and found excellent conservation of
both Rab and syntaxin genes plus components of the multivesicular body ESCRT system, suggesting that the major
endocytic transport pathways are likely ancient [24,27].
However, evidence for substantial secondary losses of certain factors, for example Rab4, was also obtained, implicating secondary loss as a driver in the evolution of taxonspecific trafficking features together with emergence of
novel functions in specific lineages [27]. Consistent with
this pattern of loss or degeneration is a recent study of the
N-glycosylation system, where multiple absences of genes
responsible for the construction of the dolichol-PP-linked
N-glycan precursor were detected [28], plus the independ-

ent loss of Golgi complex cisternal stacking in, at least,
four major eukaryotic lineages [25].
An investigation in metazoa, yeast and streptophyte
plants showed that the four SM protein families are separate and encompassed representatives of two eukaryotic
super-groups, Opisthokonta and Viridiplantae [29]. However, further sampling of additional taxa is needed to
properly address the distribution of the SM families and
when these families originated. Similarly, a limited
number of potential evolutionary relationships between
the COG, GARP and exocyst tethering complexes have
been described [17,30], based nearly exclusively on the
presence of shared domains in yeast homologues of the

complexes. Here we investigated the relationships and
distributions of tethering factors and SM proteins across
multiple representative taxa. In terms of deeper evolutionary relationships, we considered whether there was evidence for a common ancestral complex that gave rise to all
of the extant tethering complexes, or independent evolution of each complex. The first model predicts a degree of
sequence relatedness between the proteins comprising the
different complexes. Further, we also considered the possibility that the tethering complexes may have arisen after
the LCEA and therefore would display restricted taxon distribution. We find weak evidence for relationships
between the complexes, explainable as the product of
functional sequence constraints, and consistent with independent evolutionary origins. Furthermore, we find that
the presence of SM proteins and the tethering complexes
is wide spread, suggesting that they are ancient features of
the membrane-trafficking machinery.

Results and discussion
Evolutionary relationships between and within tethering
complexes
We chose to investigate, using BLAST approaches, the relationships between all identified subunits of the COG, exocyst, TRAPP, Dsl1, HOPS and GARP tethering complexes
(Figure 2). These factors are involved in trafficking from
the ER, through the Golgi complex and within the endosome/recycling system [31]. We initially addressed the
evolutionary origin of the various tethering complexes to
determine if there was evidence for a common origin or,
alternatively, if evidence suggested an independent origin
for each. Weak inter-complex relationships have been
detected previously by PSI-BLAST algorithms demonstrating a distant relationship between some of the COG and
exocyst subunits (COG3-Exo70p and COG8-Sec5p), and
the Sec3p exocyst component and Vps52p GARP factor
[17,30].

We analysed all of the S. cerevisiae tethering factors by PSIBLAST against the non-redundant database and applied
criteria for assessing homology as discussed in the methods, with a few numerical examples discussed below. The
Vps52p-Sec3p relationship was confirmed, and we were
able to detect further similarities between GARP components Vps53p and Vps54p and additional exocyst subunits, suggesting that a subfraction of the exocyst could be
related by distant sequence similarity to GARP (Figure
3A). In addition, similarities between the GARP subunits
Vsp52p, Vps53p and Vps54p and certain COG subunits
were found, but many of these relationships are restricted
to rather small regions of sequence spanning <200 amino
acids. For COG, in addition to the relationship with
GARP, we confirmed the previously reported COG3Exo30p and COG8-Sec5p relationships, but we also
found that COG1, 2, 4, 7 and 8 demonstrated some simi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/29

larity to exocyst subunits, again of a limited nature. Significantly, the same subgroup of COG subunits
demonstrates similarity with both GARP and the exocyst
(COG1, 2, 4, 7, 8), but in contrast the exocyst subunits
displaying relationships to GARP or COG were distinct. A
relationship was also detected between ZW10, the metazoan equivalent of Dsl1, and two exocyst components.
Interestingly, no intercomplex relationships were detected
for the HOPS or TRAPP complexes. In no case was there
evidence for an extensive relationship that encompassed
the majority of the predicted protein sequence, or indication of a shared domain or overall architecture.
Intra-complex relationships were previously detected
within an amphipathic helix present in several COG subunits (1, 2, 5 and 8), exocyst components (Sec5p, Sec8p
and Exo84p) plus two of the GARP subunits (Vps53p and
54p), but the conservation is very weak, even between
orthologues from taxonomically close organisms, e.g.
Homo sapiens and S. cerevisiae COG2 (ldlC and Sec35p
respectively) [30]. The significance of this latter relationship is unclear, especially given the compositional restriction imposed for a region presenting amphipathicity. We
again used PSI-BLAST analysis to further investigate relationships within individual tethering complexes (Figure
3B). Multiple relationships between COG subunits were
uncovered, although these excluded COG3 and COG6
that appear unrelated to the remaining COG components.
Three putative relationships were found in exocyst, and
which overall connects Sec3p, Sec5p, Sec15p and Exo84p.
With the exception of Sec3p, these factors are also those
that display connectivity to COG.
For the HOPS complex, four of the six subunits exhibit a
degree of relatedness. As this complex does not appear to
be related to other tethering complexes, possibly HOPS
arose by repeated duplication of these related subunits,
coupled with acquisition of the unique subunits, Vps16p
and Vps33p. As Vps39p and Vps41p are less well retained
across evolution (discussed below), this pattern of relatedness is also consistent with a degree of redundancy
between these two subunits and Vps11p/Vps18p respectively. Vps33p contains a Sec1 domain, so this factor is
essential for the correct interaction of HOPS with its cognate SNAREs, whilst Vps16p provides binding specificity
for Ypt7p. Hence a likely minimal functional HOPS complex could be built from Vps11p, 16p, 18p and 33p, and
such a configuration is present in several taxa.
Robust relationships were detected within the TRAPP
complex for the presence of two families of proteins comprising the majority of TRAPP I; this has been reported
previously [17] and suggests that TRAPP evolved from a
simpler complex, likely consisting of single Bet3p and
Bet5p isoforms. Bet3p, Trs33p and Trs31p all contain a

choice of colour is arbitrary. In panel A, the individual connections have been gathered together into grey ribbons between the
complexes for clarity. Note that PSI-BLAST analyses retrieve multiple subunits of GARP, COG and exocyst in a reciprocal
manner, while only two such associations are identified between Dsl1 and exocyst. HOPS and TRAPP are not interconnected
with the other tethering complexes.

Bet3 domain, whilst Trs20p, Trs23p and Bet5p have a sybindin domain in common. The Bet3 domain is a dimeric
structure that forms hydrophobic channels and is likely
responsible for membrane localisation [32], hence the
presence of more than one Bet3p domain-containing protein is consistent with the stable interaction of TRAPP
with the Golgi complex, and suggests a common origin
for Bet3p, Trs31p and Trs33p. The presence of a sybindin
domain in Bet5p, Trs20p and Trs23p also hints at more
distant relationships with SNARE proteins as sybindin is a
subset of the SNARE structural clan.
At face value, the above data could be taken as evidence
for a common origin for the tethering complex subunits.
However, with the exception of the TRAPPI complex, the
relatively low E values for PSI-BLAST hits between the
tether components (typically in the range 10-4 to 10-7)
only provide evidence of weak similarity bordering on the
statistically insignificant. The alternative interpretation is
that PSI-BLAST detected convergent evolution, i.e. the
acquisition of common structural elements in otherwise
disparate factors. This is commonly observed amongst
coiled coil proteins, where the restriction on amino acid
composition leads to highly similar sequences that have
independent origins. In our PSI-BLAST analysis, hits of
higher significance were found against coiled-coil regions
of proteins that are clearly unrelated, for example myosin
and Uso1p, than between tethering factors, suggesting the
detection of limited sequence similarity that does not
reflect an evolutionary relationship. By contrast, the clear
homology between Trs23 and Bet5 in TRAPPI has a score
of 10-19. Further, inspection of the similar regions identified by PSI-BLAST indicates that much of the similarity
resides within sequence predicted to form coiled coil secondary structure; for example Vps53p-COG7, ZW10Sec8p, COG1-COG8, Sec8-Vps54 and Vps54-Sec8p – in
all cases the homologous region detected by PSI-BLAST is
at the N-terminus, and the majority of this region is predicted as coiled coil (additional file 1). This finding is in
agreement to that made by Whyte and Munro [17] for a
more limited set of tether factors.
No evidence for any homology between TRAPP or HOPS
and the other tether complexes was obtained, suggesting
that the mechanisms by which these assemblies function
may be rather distinct, beyond the simple provision of stabilisation of trans-SNARE complexes. The radically different levels of complexity of the tether complexes is also
consistent with distinct modes of action, for example Dsl1
is limited to four subunits, whereas the full TRAPP complex comprises ten subunits. Hence despite a common
mechanistic role, the precise molecular interactions
underpinning distinct intracellular transport steps are
potentially divergent. This may reflect interactions with

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/29

distinct coat systems as well as other factors required to
control and complete individual steps in vesicle transport.
Recent work has uncovered a further deep evolutionary
relationship between the multiple coats responsible for
protein sorting, membrane deformation and vesicle budding. For example, distant but clear homology exists
between coatomer, clathrin and adaptin proteins, while a
conserved architecture has recently been uncovered for
proteins of the nuclear pore complex and the clathrin coat
system [14,33]. Significantly, this latter relationship is not
easily detectable by BLAST algorithms, and required secondary structure prediction and controlled proteolytic
mapping to validate. However, the relationships differ
further from those detected for the tether factors in being
both more extensive, i.e. encompassing a greater proportion of the polypeptide, and more varied, i.e. including
regions of the polypeptide with differing secondary structure. Hence they are of a more substantial nature than the
tether complex similarities. We conclude that evidence for
a common ancestry for the tether factors is not present,
and it is most likely that these complexes have independent molecular origins, with convergent evolution of
coiled-coil regions. Given the preponderance of coiledcoil proteins, including the SNAREs themselves, involved
in vesicle fusion, the presence of these structural motifs
within the tether complexes is perhaps not surprising.
Tethering complex distribution across the eukaryotes
We probed a total of 17 genomes, with predicted protein
sequences corresponding to 40 tethering factors, representing the entire tethering complex repertoire as known
from S. cerevisiae and H. sapiens (Figure 4, additional file
3). The major feature that emerges from this analysis is the
wide-spread taxonomic presence of the majority of the
tethering complexes. Specifically, taking the most parsimonious view, the majority of taxa lacking a complex (or
significant numbers of constituent factors) can be
ascribed as either secondary loss or divergence of the
sequence to such an extent as to be undetectable. Only the
Dsl1 and TRAPPII complexes have a distribution that is
equivocal. The evolutionary distributions of the individual complexes are considered below.
TRAPP
Evidence suggests that the seven subunit TRAPPI complex,
involved in intra-Golgi anteriograde transport, has likely
arisen via gene duplication, as Bet3p/Trs31p/Trs33p and
Bet5p/Trs20p/Trs23p define subfamilies of the TRAPPI
factors. Significantly, of these six subunits, only Trs33 is
nonessential in yeast, as is the unrelated seventh subunit,
Trs85. However, mutation in Trs20 leads to spondyloepyphesial dysplasia in humans [18], i.e. mutants are viable,
indicating a lack of essentiality and therefore differential

selection pressure for TRAPP subunits may exist in different taxa.
We observed near universal conservation of the TRAPPI
complex across the taxa studied here (Figure 4, additional
file 3), and therefore any gene duplication events clearly
predate the speciation of the various eukaryotic lineages.
The lack of three TRAPPI subunits from Giardia intestinalis
may suggest that the TRAPPI complex is nonfunctional in
Giardia, although interestingly two each of the Bet3 and
Bet5 family are present. This divergent structure is potentially consistent with the novel aspects of trafficking in
this organism where even basic organellar arrangements
appear to be divergent from other eukaryotes [34].
The primary sequence structure of the individual TRAPPI
subunits does appear to vary however, as several orthologues appear to have either extensions or deletions and
differential levels of sequence conservation are seen; these
likely represent emergence of species-specific functions.
Bet3p is very highly conserved in terms of length throughout the eukaryotes, whilst Bet5p in Arabidopsis thaliana
and Plasmodium falciparum contains a short N-terminal
extension as compared to the S. cerevisiae and H. sapiens
orthologues, and Caenorhabditis elegans has two isoforms,
both of which have extensive C-terminal extensions
(additional file 2).
For TRAPPII, Trs65 is unique to S. cerevisiae. The two
remaining subunits, Trs120p and Trs130p, are more
widely distributed, being found in several Opisthokonta
taxa, as well as in the Amoebozoa, Viridiplantae, and stramenopiles, but TRAPPII is totally absent from the Apicomplexa, Excavata and Cyanidioschyzon merolae.
Therefore the complete TRAPPII trimer is most likely a
recent acquisition in S. cerevisiae, whilst Trs120p/Trs130p
represent an ancestral form. Significantly Trs120 and
Trs130 are essential in gene deletion experiments in S. cerevisiae, while Trs65 knockouts in yeast are viable and the
effect on anteriograde transport is comparatively mild,
consistent with the view that Trs120p/130p forms the
minimal functional core [35].
Dsl1
This complex has a major role in Golgi to ER retrograde
transport, and in S. cerevisiae all four subunits are essential. This essentiality contrasts with the low level of retention of Dsl1p and Dsl3p subunits across the eukaryotes;
Dsl3p is unique to yeast whilst the core heterotrimer
(Dsl1p/Tip20p/Sec20p) was only recovered from
Opisthokonta, Amoebozoa and Viridiplantae groups (Figure 4, additional file 3). The Sec20 subunit demonstrates
rather wider distribution than the holocomplex, also
being found in the Excavata, stramenopiles and the Alveolata, suggesting that Sec20p can function independently

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/29

of other Dsl1 subunits and consistent with its role as a QSNARE. A functional dimer of Dsl1p/Tip20p could retain
both the COPI binding and Ufe1 T-SNARE interaction,
linking coatomer and SNARE activity [36].
Organisms where none of the complex subunits are
found, specifically C. merolae, Toxoplasma gondii, and Tetrahymena thermophila, suggest probable legitimate
absence. Only Dsl1 is retained in C. elegans, a taxon
closely related to the query H. sapiens sequence and with a
reliable database implying true absence of the other subunits; fundamental differences in retrograde mechanisms
amongst the metazoa, which have yet to be described in
detail, may be indicated by this finding. These observations imply that the functions of all subunits can be dispensed with in certain lineages and may reflect the
absence of a Dsl1 dependent Golgi to ER retrograde transport pathway in those systems.
Conserved oligomeric Golgi complex (COG)
The octameric COG complex mediates transport through
the Golgi complex, and plays a particularly important role
in maintenance of the N-glycosylation system, at least in
mammalian cells. Of the COG subunits, only three,
COG2, COG3 and COG4, are essential in knockout experiments in S. cerevisiae. Significantly, these three subunits
are thought to form a subcomplex, based on yeast twohybrid and co-immunoprecipitation studies [37].

COG is fully retained in S. cerevisiae, H. sapiens, the
trypanosomatids, A. thaliana, Dictyostelium discoideum and
Phytophthora ramorum. This distribution, together with the
presence of partial COG complexes in additional taxa, is
consistent with an ancient origin, together with some
likely secondary losses of subunits (e.g. T. thermophila and
T. gondii). Clearly, complete absence of COG can be tolerated, as neither the P. falciparum, nor G. intestinalis
genomes encode detectable COG subunits, suggestive of
legitimate loss of the complex in these taxa. Thus COG
requirements are species-specific, as also shown by severe
phenotype of COG1 mutants in mammalian cells [18], in
contrast to no detectable phenotype in an RNAi knockdown in Trypanosoma brucei [38].
It is possible that the differential requirement for COG is
due in part to the functionality required from the Golgi
complex. Specifically, a role in maintaining the correct
environment for N-glycan processing is clear from the
phenotypes obtained in COG mutants in mammalian
cells [18]. Amongst the taxa sampled here P. falciparum
and G. intestinalis are unusual in that there is now excellent evidence for a highly diminished N-glycosylation
machinery in these lineages, including a complete
absence of mannosylation, and hence substrates for elaboration by galactosyl- or sialyltransferases [28]; the corre-

lation between the absence of both mannose-containing
N-glycans and the COG complex is highly suggestive of
functional relatedness.
HOPS
This hexameric complex functions in endosome to vacuole/lysosome transport and is well conserved, despite the
nonessentiality of the subunits in S. cerevisiae. Except for
Vps39, this complex is almost fully conserved in most
genomes. The exception is C. merolae where the complex
is almost completely absent. Whilst Vps39 is poorly conserved at the sequence level, and it remains possible that
for some taxa the open reading frame was not detected by
BLAST, additional data also suggest that Vps39p and
Vps41p are less important for HOPS function [39]. Vps11,
16, 18 and 33 are class B Vps mutants with severe phenotypes – Vps11p/16p/18p/33p appears to be the core complex with Vps39p and 41p (class C mutants with milder
phenotypes) providing accessory subunits and function
[39]. Indeed the Vps11p/16p/18p/33p complex can alternatively associate with Sec8p, instead of Vps39p/41p [39],
providing a link to the membrane. Vps39p/41p interacts
directly with Ypt7p (i.e. Rab7), and therefore the precise
function of Rab7 may depend on the presence of Vps39p/
41p. Because Vps39 is not found in the Chromalveolata
genomes sampled here, this raises the possibility that this
pathway is different in these taxa than in most other lineages.

subunits each. All of the subunits are essential in S. cerevisiae. Significantly, different subunits appear to mediate
interaction with the plasma membrane in mammals and
yeast; in S. cerevisiae Sec3p binds Rho1p and the plasma
membrane, while Sec15p binds the Sec4p GTPase on the
vesicle membrane [42]. By contrast, in mammals Sec3p
does not bind Rho1p or the plasma membrane; instead
Exo70p may mark sites of exocytosis on the plasma membrane [43]. The full complex is present in the
Opisthokonta, Amoebozoa and higher plants. However,
the presence of at least some exocyst subunits in other taxa
suggests that the exocyst is an ancient system. Our observations are consistent with a recent report describing the
presence of Exo70p in land plants and other diverse
eukaryotes [44]. In our analysis, no subunits are found in
G. intestinalis, while only one is recovered in C. merolae, P.
falciparum and T. gondii, suggesting that, in these systems,
full exocyst function may be absent.

GARP
GARP mediates an endosome to Golgi transport pathway.
The complex is comparatively small, consisting of four
subunits, none of which is essential in S. cerevisiae.
Vps52p/53p/54p form a stable vesicle-associated complex
[40], and Vps51p acts to tether this to the SNARE protein
Tlg1p. The interaction may have little to do with function
as ablation of the Vps51p-Tlg1p interaction has little
effect in vivo in yeast [41] and presumably additional factors can recruit Vps52p/53p/54p to the membrane. This is
also entirely consistent with the observation that Vps51 is
the most sparsely distributed member of this complex,
being restricted to taxa in the Opisthokonta lineage. Of
the remaining subunits, Vps52p and Vps53p are the best
retained across taxa. Interestingly the Vps52p/53p/54p
complex is retained in higher plants and in trypanosomatids, indicating the presence of a retrograde transport system in these organisms that presumably actively returns
material to the Golgi complex from the endosomal system. While the complex is not well conserved (Figure 4,
additional file 3), the overall pattern of subunit occurrence argues that this is an ancient complex.

Insights into taxon-specific functions
A number of interesting features are apparent from the
data-set when considered by organism rather than by
complex. Most dramatic is the absence of several complexes from a number of lineages. Specifically, no subunits were recovered in G. intestinalis for COG, GARP,
exocyst or TRAPPII and only Sec20 of Dsl1 was found.
Whilst there is the possibility of increased sequence divergence for this system, and hence failure to detect homologues that are in fact present, it is highly unlikely that this
accounts for the extreme level of absence and is consistent
with an earlier analysis sampling a wide range of endocytic functions [27] and with the somewhat unusual
organisation of the endomembrane system in Giardia
[34]. Also consistent with earlier work is the observation
that C. merolae appears to possess only a complete TRAPPI
and a possible minimal COG complex, with single subunits of a few of the other complexes. This feature may
reflect both the small genome of this organism as well as
the extreme environment (pH 2.0) that C. merolae exploits
[45], suggesting a radically minimalised trafficking system
[27]. The Apicomplexa may well lack several complexes,
with good evidence for the presence of HOPS, and TRAPPI
and only limited representation for the others. Given that
we sampled two genomes from this group, and the patterns of subunit recovery are overall very similar, we consider this prediction to be robust. These observations
indicate that mechanisms for transport through the Golgi
complex, for exocytosis and for Golgi to ER trafficking are
likely either mediated by novel factors, or alternatively are
highly simplified in the Apicomplexa, in part reflected by
a minimised N-glycosylation system in P. falciparum [28].

Exocyst
This complex directs exocytic vesicles to the plasma membrane and consists of two subcomplexes of three and five

Perhaps less surprising is the high degree of conservation
of the complexes throughout the Opisthokonta, Amoebozoa, Viridiplantae and the Kinetoplastida. However, sig-

nificant variation in the complexes recovered even
between comparatively closely related taxa does underscore the potential lability of the trafficking system. For
example, in Cryptococcus neoformans, we were unable to
recover by BLAST many subunits of both COG and TRAPPII, demonstrating a significant divergence between this
system and the model yeast S. cerevisiae. The Kinetoplastida retain the majority of the complexes, lacking only Dsl1
and TRAPPII. Overall, the kinetoplastids are extremely
similar to each other, emphasizing a strong retention of
this machinery in these three parasites despite their very
different life-cycles.
SM proteins
Another major set of players in machinery encoding specificity of membrane fusion events are the SM proteins
[8]. We, therefore, addressed the evolution of these components via comparative genomics and phylogenetics.
Our BLAST search identified at least one putative homologue for each of the defined SM protein families in all of
genomes examined (data not shown). While such evidence was used in a few cases, discussed below, to identify
the various homologues, phylogenetic analysis was pursued in order to provide a more rigorous basis for annotation. An initial dataset was analyzed, composed of
homologues of each of the SM protein families from representatives of the five sampled eukaryotic supergroups.
From ML and ML-corrected distance analyses, the four SM
protein families resolved with 100% support with both
methods for the clades of Sly1p, Vps33p and Vps45p
(data not shown). The clade of Sec1p was supported by
bootstrap values of 81% and 99% with the two methods
respectively. This provided preliminary evidence for the
expansion of the four SM protein families prior to the
divergence of most eukaryotic lineages.

A second analysis included representative sequences from
all taxa sampled. However, the resolution of this dataset
was poor (data not shown) and the sequences from G.
intestinalis and C. merolae represented divergent, and presumably rapidly-evolving, homologues. These were
removed from the dataset and the resulting alignment was
then analysed by Bayesian, ML and ML corrected distance
methods. As in the preliminary analysis, there was very
good support for the robust separation of clades representing homologues of Sec1p, Sly1p, Vps33p and Vps45p,
and each clade contained representatives of each of the
five sampled eukaryotic super-groups (Figure 5). Finally
we aligned the most canonical sequences of each putative
SM family from G. intestinalis and C. merolae (as predicted
by BLAST) to an SM alignment with one representative of
each supergroup for each paralogue family. In the case of
C. merolae, it was possible to classify the sequences to their
protein family with very strong support values for Sly1p
(1.0/100%/100%, Bayesian posterior probability/ML/ML

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/29

corrected bootstrap values), Sec1p (1.0/95%/100%),
Vps33p (1.0/100%/100%) and Vps45p (1.0/98%/100%).
For Giardia, it was possible to assign Sly1p (1.0/60%/
87%), Vps33p (1.0/89%/100%) and Vps45p (0.97/25%/
85%) homologues with confidence. The putative Sec1p
homologue was only supported by Bayesian posterior
probabilities (0.90) and BLAST, but not bootstrap support, and hence we can only tentatively assign this
sequence as a Sec1p. This is contrary to previous reports
suggesting loss in G. intestinalis and C. merolae of some SM
protein homologues [27] and contrary to other membrane trafficking machinery that appears reduced in these
taxa [27,34].
These data strongly imply that the SM protein families
originated via gene duplications from an ancestral SM
protein gene, and this process must have occurred prior to
the last common ancestor of the taxa sampled, which
should represent a good approximation of the LCEA [19].
Our results confirm and extend previous analyses based
on sparser taxon sampling [29]. Thus we see the same
major patterns of acquisition of complexity via paralogous gene duplication as observed for the syntaxins, vesicle coats, Rabs and indeed much of the major membrane
trafficking machinery. Our analyses also allow us to infer
how different modes of syntaxin binding may have arisen
for Vps33p. Because the HOPS complex appears to have
evolved independently from the other tether complexes,
and Vps33p is the only SM protein incorporated into a
tether as well as the only SM protein not to interact
directly with its SNARE, we deduce that Vps33p likely did
ancestrally bind its syntaxin directly and may have been
co-opted later by HOPS, changing its binding mode. This
also implies that the ancestral mode of SM-syntaxin interaction was through direct binding.

Conclusion
Most of the specific events within the intracellular transport system of eukaryotic cells exploit a common core of
protein factors that mediate membrane budding, translocation and docking/fusion. Members of the Rab, ARF,
SNARE and coat protein families participate in many of
these events, and each family is clearly derived from a single common ancestor. The presence of this near universal
core group of proteins mediating the basic steps of exocytosis and endocytosis indicates expansion and functional
diversification prior to the formation of the major eukaryotic super-groups [24]. Here we addressed the evolutionary origins of the SM proteins as well as the tethering
factor complexes, the latter having a substantially more
diverse structural basis than GTPases and SNAREs.
By comparisons of the complete genomes of 17 taxa representing five of the six major eukaryotic groups [19] for
40 tethering factors and the SM proteins, we determined

Phylogenetic analysis of SM proteins from eukaryotes in the major sampled supergroups
Phylogenetic analysis of SM proteins from eukaryotes in the major sampled supergroups. This analysis shows that
the four SM protein families robustly form separate clades as shown by the bold support values and denoted by the vertical
bars to the right of each clade. Support values are given in the order of Bayesian posterior probabilities/ML bootstraps/ML corrected distance bootstraps. That each family encompasses all of the sampled eukaryotic diversity is illustrated by the colourcoded taxon names, which follow the scheme of Figure 4. Support values for all nodes supported by 0.95 posterior probability
and 50% bootstrap support or better, are illustrated symbolically. This analysis demonstrates that the SM protein families are
ubiquitously found in the sampled eukaryotes and their evolution likely pre-dates the last common eukaryotic ancestor.

that both are widely distributed across eukaryotic evolution. The most likely interpretation of our findings is that
these complexes are an ancient feature of the eukaryotes
and have an origin that predates the diversification of the
separate eukaryotic lineages. These findings further confirm the earlier indications of a complex endomembrane
system for LCEA [24,27].
Lineages that lack entire tethering complexes likely lost
these factors as a result of selective pressure. Multiple samplings of taxa in several major groups argue against simple
failure of BLAST routines to detect these factors. Whether
the failure to detect many of the tether subunits is due to
methodological failure, based on the extreme sequence
divergence of the homologue in question, or whether it is
due to true loss, may be difficult to determine. Notwithstanding this, there is clearly a distinct pattern of conservation between these two components of the specificity
machinery, i.e. the poorly conserved tether complexes and
the more easily detectable and more highly conserved SM
proteins. This suggests that, while there is flexibility or
relaxed selection for the tethering machinery, there is
more restrictive functional selection and resulting evolutionary constraints on the SM proteins. Our data also provide a guide for studies intended to probe functionality of
trafficking pathways in divergent systems. For example,
determining essentiality and function of incompletely
retained complexes would provide an excellent means by
which to test both conservation of function and the
importance of retaining composition. Additionally, several of the divergent organisms are highly important pathogens, and these data provide further insights into the
molecular cell biology of these systems.
Two major patterns have emerged concerning the evolution of membrane trafficking. The first pattern addresses
the timing of this evolutionary innovation; multiple lines
of evidence suggest that the complement of protein trafficking machinery and the organelles commonly held as
involved in membrane-trafficking were established very
early in eukaryotic evolution [11-14,19,22-26]. Our analyses of the tethering complexes and the SM proteins are
consistent with this paradigm and add two further components to the list of characteristics possessed by the
ancestral eukaryote.
The second pattern regards the process by which the
machinery increased in complexity. Analyses of SNAREs
[10-12], Rabs [13] and the coat proteins [14] all suggest
the presence of a single ancestor of each protein family
giving rise to the different organelle specific protein
machineries via gene duplication. Evidence that the ARF/
Sar1 family arose first, and was followed by the Rab/Ras
family has also been presented [52], but our present analysis is not able to confirm or refute the concept that the ER

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/29

predates the origins of the remaining endomembrane
compartments. Because each of the subfamilies (or in the
case of the coats, each distantly homologous coat) is characteristically associated with a particular organelle or
pathway, one model is that the gene duplications were
concurrent with, and possibly involved in, the process of
evolutionarily deriving the various novel organelles.
While the SM proteins conform precisely to this pattern,
the tether complexes do not. The tethers then bring to
light a novel mechanism of evolutionary elaboration of
the membrane trafficking system, whereby at least some
organelle specific machinery originated independently,
and yet still before the LCEA.
The precise origin of the tethering complexes is somewhat
equivocal, as evidence is not compelling for common
ancestry amongst these factors. Even if the COG, exocyst,
Dsl1 and GARP complexes were derived from an ancestral
complex, the TRAPP and HOPS complexes appear independently derived. If the former four complexes did originate from a single ancestral complex, then these would
have been sufficient to service the basic trafficking pathways. The latter two complexes would be later additions;
however they still arose before the LCEA. In the more
extreme scenario, the tether complexes each evolved convergently, with the only major common requirement
being the presence of a coiled-coil forming domain that
likely could interact with additional factors of the fusion
machinery and the organellar membrane. As more sensitive algorithms for deducing homology become available,
it may be possible to confirm or refute the relatedness of
the tethering complexes and distinguish between these
scenarios.
Various authors have proposed that the key to the evolution of the membrane-trafficking organelles and system
are the SNAREs [11], Rabs [3] or the SM proteins [29]. The
tethering complexes are the components of the specificity
machinery that link all of these factors together either
physically, functionally or both. An understanding of all
of these components will be required to determine how
vesicle fusion specificity evolved. Because the details of
how the tethering complexes and other factors encode
specificity remain unclear, it is too early to fully address
the evolution of membrane trafficking specificity. Once a
solid functional mechanism is established in model systems, determining which aspects of these mechanisms are
generalisable will be the next step for elucidating a common functional mechanism and obtaining a full understanding of its evolution.

Methods
Databases
We selected taxa that would provide a wide sampling of
the six eukaryotic super-groups, and as far as possible

Page 13 of 17

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:29

include at least two representative taxa in each group to
facilitate detection of species-specific secondary losses versus absence from the group, and to minimise failures due
to species-specific sequence divergence. In fact, we are
only able to sample five supergroups as no genome
sequence data are available for a representative of the
Rhizaria. We also restricted our analysis to those genomes
that were completed, such that failure to retrieve a BLAST
hit could be ascribed to true absence or extreme divergence, and not to database incompleteness; this resulted
in selection of seventeen taxa, for a total of over 650 individual BLAST queries. Trypanosomatid data were
obtained from the Sanger Institute website, and either
interrogated via the geneDB WWW interface [46] or
locally. Yeast data were obtained from MIPS [47] or the
Stanford yeast genome database [48]. P. ramorum, Thalassiosira pseudonana, and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii data
were from JGI [49]. T. gondii data were from ToxoDB [50],
T. thermophila data were from TIGR [51], G. intestinalis
data from GiardiaDB [52], D. discoideum data at GeneDB
[46], C. neoformans data were from the Broad Institute
website [53] and C. merolae data from the C. merolae
BLAST server [54]. All other organismal genome data were
obtained via Uniprot [55] or the NCBI BLAST interface
[56].
Taxonomic homology survey
Data were retrieved from online databases using BLAST
[57]. H. sapiens or S. cerevisiae predicted protein sequences
were typically used as queries, with default BLAST parameters relaxed to maximise recovery of weaker hits. In cases
where these initial queries failed to recover a candidate
orthologue, query sequences from a taxon more closely
related to the target genome (based on relationships from
[19]) were used for further searching, should such a clear
orthologue query be available, derived either from this
survey or from annotated databases. All recovered
sequences were subjected to reverse BLAST, typically
against the S. cerevisiae or H. sapiens genome. In addition
we also subjected sequences to searches through the NCBI
conserved domain database (CDDB), using default
parameters. This approach can detect structural relationships using alignment against HMM profiles, and while a
hit is good evidence for structural (and hence sequence)
relatedness, failure to retrieve a CDDB profile is not strong
evidence for absence as weaker relationships may fail to
be detected. For retrieval of SM candidate orthologues, A.
thaliana or H. sapiens orthologues were used, with candidate orthologues validated by reverse BLAST against the
nonredundant protein database. Paralogue-specific annotation was derived from phylogenetic analysis described
below.

A candidate orthologue was considered to have been
retrieved if a reverse BLAST recovered the original query

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/29

within the top five hits. Additionally, both for initial candidate identification and for validation by reverse BLAST,
sequences were analysed by alignment for the presence of
significant sequence similarities, and also were parsed
through NCBI CDDB rather than relying solely on e-value
cut-offs. Failure to complete all of these tests resulted in an
assignment of "not found".
Inter- and intra-complex homology assessment
With the exception of the relationships between some of
the TRAPP subunits, BLAST alone failed to identify
sequence relationships between the tethering factors. In
order to increase sensitivity, PSI-BLAST analysis was
undertaken. Three iterations were performed against the
NCBI nr database using S. cerevisiae or metazoan
sequences as queries. All hits retrieved above the default
threshold were inspected, and a relationship was only
considered valid if factors from multiple diverse taxa were
returned, and if there was evidence for a reciprocal relationship, i.e. factor A identified factor B, and visa versa.
Additional alignments and reverse BLAST experiments
were performed to verify relationships as appropriate.
Alignments and phylogenetic reconstructions
Initial alignments of the tethering factors and the SM proteins were created in Clustal X [58] and manually
adjusted. For the SM proteins, taxa were then added by
hand from pair-wise Clustal alignments of the relevant
taxon with the nearest representative within each eukaryotic supergroup. Several alignments were constructed. A
template alignment with a single taxonomic representative of each major eukaryotic super-group for each SM
protein family was created with 32 taxa and 326 positions.
An alignment with all taxa was then created with 80 taxa
and 318 positions. A dataset with the long branch taxa, G.
intestinalis and C. merolae, removed was then made (72
taxa and 282 positions). Finally the G. intestinalis and C.
merolae sequences were added back to the template alignment producing alignments with 36 taxa and 338 and 336
positions respectively. Analysis of these final two alignments enabled classification of the SM protein representatives from these divergent taxa. Since the purpose of the
study was to establish whether each taxon had at least one
representative of each SM protein family, and not to fully
resolve the classification of each protein from each taxon
sampled, some homologues from some taxa were
excluded from the phylogeny. Only the most canonical
homologue of each protein family, as assessed by BLASTp
score and by size comparison, was used for the relevant
phylogeny. All alignments were masked such that only
unambiguously homologous positions were used for phylogenetic analysis and are available upon request. The
model of sequence evolution for each dataset was determined using Tree-Puzzle v.5.2 [59] based on initial neighbor-joining trees and incorporating an 8-category gamma

correction for rate variation. Trees were then built using
Mr. Bayes v. 3.1.2 [60] for Bayesian analysis to determine
optimal tree topology and posterior probability values for
the nodes, with 1 000 000 Markov Chain Monte Carlo
generations and the burn-in value determined graphically
by removing trees before the plateau. Phyml v.2.4.4 [61]
was used to obtain maximum-likelihood bootstrap values; and Fitch or Neighbor-Joining v.3.6a3 from the
PHYLIP package [62] using the distance matrices generated by Tree-Puzzle and Puzzleboot [63] from 1000 (for
Neighbor-Joining) or 100 (for Fitch) pseudo-replicate
datasets respectively. Nodes with greater than 0.95 posterior probability and better than 80% bootstrap support
were considered robust, although in Figure 5 all nodes
with support values greater than 0.95 posterior probability and 50% bootstrap are shown. Other than the template alignment (32 taxa, 318 positions), which was
analyzed by ML and ML-corrected distance only, all alignments were analyzed by all three methods.
