Abstract
Tetrapyrrole molecules are distributed in virtually all living organisms on Earth. In mammals,
tetrapyrrole end products are closely linked to oxygen metabolism. Since increasingly complex
trophic functional systems for using oxygen are considered in the post-traumatic inflammatory
response, it can be suggested that tetrapyrrole molecules and, particularly their derived pigments,
play a key role in modulating inflammation.
In this way, the diverse colorfulness that the inflammatory response triggers during its evolution
would reflect the major pathophysiological importance of these pigments in each one of its phases.
Therefore, the need of exploiting this color resource could be considered for both the diagnosis
and treatment of the inflammation.

Background
The inflammatory response related to surgery (elective or
anesthetized injury) and to trauma (accidental or unanesthetized injury) could be considered a surgical inflammation [1]. The surgical inflammation, as an inflammatory
process, could be viewed as composed of a series of overlapping successive phases [2]. That is why it is common
that each researcher chooses for his study a specific aspect
of this complex response. At the same time, the interrelation of the knowledge that is successively obtained allows
for better understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms of the surgical inflammation. It also allows for suggesting new possible meanings of this inflammatory
response.
Color is a quality of the surgical inflammation that has
always been observed. The color in inflammation is one
of the components by which the classical description of
inflammation accounts for the visual changes observed.
Based on visual observation, the ancients characterized

inflammation by four cardinal signs, namely redness,
swelling, heat and pain [3].
It could be considered that the color of the injured tissue
is changeable because both the traumatic injury (contusion and/or wound) and the inflammatory response
related to this aggression are evolutive. The post-traumatic
acute inflammatory response has especially been
described as a succession of three functional phases with
increasingly complex trophic functional systems for using
oxygen [2,4]. It is considered that also the state of wound
oxygenation is a key determinant of healing outcomes [5].
And, interestingly enough, it could be imagined that an
array of colors is displayed through this evolution. Therefore, it could be considered that tetrapyrrole molecules,
such as heme, in addition to contributing a large variety of
colors to the tissues, are employed through the evolutive
process of acute inflammation. The great variability of
tetrapyrrole end-products, diversified both in plant and
animal life during the evolution of eukaryotic cells could

mean an adaption to the metabolic and biochemical
changes imposed by the development in different environments, from an unbreathable atmosphere to an environment fully enriched by oxygen [2].
Tissue injury and inflammation
- Tissue injury
In mechanical trauma, it is considered that the inflammatory response is induced by tissue injury [1,2]. However,
its special initial superimposition suggests that a continuous pathophysiological mechanism is established.

Tissue injury due to mechanical energy can produce a contusion (bruise), that is, damage without tissue breakage or
damage with tissue breakage. In this last case, if the tissue
is soft, the lesion is called a wound and if the tissue is
hard, the lesion is called a fracture [6].
The contusion, based on its severity, could be classified in
three degrees: first degree, characterized by the temporary
loss of function. Although it could be associated with
edema, the alterations are reversible, and therefore, full
recovery is possible. Second degree would occur with
ecchymosis, namely with tissue infiltration by red blood
cells. The evolution would be ambivalent since cellular
and tissue alterations can be reversed or worsened, causing cell death. Thus, the oxygen plays a key role in the evolution of the second degree contusions since extreme near
anoxic environment is not compatible with tissue repair
[5]. And lastly, the third degree is an irreversible lesion
since the injury causes cell death by necrosis and the tissue
suffers from infarction [6] (Figure 1).
Cellular and tissue lesion is irreversible in the wound and
fracture since necrosis is produced. [6]. Particularly, the
wound enters the tissue suffering from a first, second or
third-degree overlapped contusion areas, as the figure 2
shows. In the third-degree contusion area, anoxia avoids
the wound repair. The evolution of the second-degree
bruised area, whether reversible or irreversible, will determine the evolution of the wound since it can increase the
necrosis area. Hypoxia in this area could be mild or modest. At last, in the first-degree contusion area, that is the
most peripheral area around the wound, the inexistence
of hypoxia avoids the complications development and,
therefore it does not affect the tissue viability.(Figure 2).
Until recently, necrosis has often been viewed as an accidental and uncontrolled cell death process. Nevertheless,
growing evidence supports the idea that necrotic cell
death may also be programmed [7]. Cellular signaling
events have been identified to initiate necrotic destruction
that could be blocked by inhibiting discrete cellular processes [8]. The most relevant mechanisms culminating in
cell necrosis correspond to mitochondrial dysfunction

Figure
Degrees1of severity in the contusions
Degrees of severity in the contusions. Injury without
breakage produced by blunt etiological agents and are made
up of concentric areas of different degrees of severity. From
the cellular point of view, the first-degree contusion is a
reversible injury. The alteration consists in small plasma bleb
formation. In the second-degree contusion, a fusion of the
blebs is produced and the plasma membrane permeability
increases. In the third-degree contusion, cell death is produced by necrosis. At the same time, contusions can be
superficial or deep. From the tissue point of view, edema is
produced in the first-degree contusion; ecchymosis would be
associated with edema in the second-degree contusion; an
infarction would be produced in the third-degree contusion.
Ecchymosis means that the red blood cells are the first blood
cells to infiltrate the interstitial space in post-traumatic
inflammation. Ecchymosis, also called a contusion or a bruise,
due to its blue color, from the Latin word cardinus (bluish)
explains its purple color.

and ATP depletion; loss of intracellular ion homeostasis
with osmotic swelling and oxidative stress; activation of
degrative hydrolases, including proteases, phosphorylases, and endonucleases; and degradation of cytoskeletal
proteins with disruption of cytoskeletal integrity [9]. Surprisingly enough, this list of mechanisms also corresponds to those that occur in the acute inflammatory

response. Therefore, the endothelium plays a bidirectional mediating role between blood flow and the interstitial space, which is where inflammation mainly takes
place [2,4].
Since the phases of the inflammatory response go from
ischemia to the development of an oxidative metabolism,
the successive pathophysiological mechanisms that
develop in the interstitium of tissues when they undergo
inflammation are considered increasingly complex
trophic functional systems for using oxygen [2,4,10].
- Phases of the Inflammatory Response
It could be considered that the acute post-traumatic
inflammatory response is made up of three overlapping
phases, whether local or systemic (Figure 3).

Figure 2
Schematic representation of a wound
Schematic representation of a wound. Injury without
breakage in the soft tissue can be superficial or deep. The
contusive wounds induce a first, second and third-degree
contusion in the tissues, as the figure shows. The evolution of
the second-degree bruised area, whether reversible or irreversible, will determine the evolution of the wound since it
can increase the necrosis area. The superficial injury with
breakage has external hemorrhaging and the deep injury
without breakage has contusions of internal tissue or intraparenchymatous hemorrhaging. a: first-degree contusion; b:
second-degree contusion; c: third-degree contusion

The first or immediate phase has been referred to as the
nervous phase, because the sensory (pain and analgesia)
and motor alterations (contraction and relaxation)
respond to the injury [2,4]. This early pathological activity, in essence, could reflect the predisposition of the
body's nociceptor nervous pathways to first suffer depo-

post-traumatic response [2,4]. It seems, that in response
to injury, cells can develop a mechanism that would play
a defensive role (inflammation) and that could favor
reversing the alterations until their inadequate expression
would make them harmful (necrotic). Hence, at a specific
moment in time, the pathophysiological mechanisms
(cellular response to injury) become pathogenic mechanisms (producers of cell death) [4].
- Tissue Inflammation
We have proposed that the acute inflammatory response
to injury by mechanical energy, regardless of whether it is
local or systemic, is based on the successive pathologic
functional predominance of the nervous, immune and
endocrine systems. This hypothesis implies that the final
and prevalent pathologic functions of these systems may
represent the consecutive phases of the response to stress
developed by the body, all of which may have a trophic
meaning for the injured tissue [4,10].

Perhaps the leading role in this response is played by the
relation between the blood and the interstitial space. This
assumption is based on the fact that the different blood
components escape the intravascular space one by one in
order to occupy the interstitial space, where they play the
main role in the successive phases of the inflammatory

Figure 3

The post-traumatic inflammatory response is considered to
be made up of three overlapping phases with increasingly
complex trophic functional systems for using oxygen. During
the first or nervous phase, oxidative and nitrosative stress
are produced. In the second or immune phase, enzymatic
stress is produced and in the third or endocrine phase, oxidative phosphorylation is reached and therefore, energetic
stress is produced. N: Nervous phase with oxidative stress
and edema which progressively subsides(blue). I: Immune
phase with enzymatic stress and its subsequent neutralization(yellow). E: Endocrine phase with its initial tissue destructuring and subsequent tissue repair through regeneration and/or fibroplasia.(red).

larization with microglia activation and neuropeptide
production. Furthermore, this nervous response coexists
almost completely with the tissue injury evolution and,
therefore, conditions it.
The nervous or immediate functional system presents
ischemia-revascularization and edema, which favor nutrition by diffusion through the injured tissue. In reality, the
tissues suffer ischemia-reoxygenation, that is, they begin
using oxygen after a more or less long period of ischemia.
It is likely that the magnitude of wound hypoxia is not
uniformly distributed throughout the affected tissue,
especially in large wounds [5]. This trophic mechanism
has a low energy requirement that does not require oxygen (ischemia) or in which the oxygen is not correctly
used, with the subsequent excessive production of reactive
oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) (reperfusion). In
this phase, while the progression of the interstitial edema
increases in the space between the epithelial cells and the
capillaries, the lymphatic circulation is simultaneously
activated (circulatory switch). Thus, the injured tissues
adopt an ischemic phenotype (hypoxia) [4] (Figure 3).
In the following immune or intermediate phase of the
inflammatory response, the tissues and organs which have
suffered ischemia-reperfusion, are infiltrated by inflammatory cells and, sometimes, by bacteria. Interstitial
inflammation is favored by the concurrent activation of
hemostasis and complement cascades. In the tissues and
organs which suffer oxidative stress, symbiosis of the
inflammatory cells and bacteria for extracellular digestion
by enzyme release (fermentation) and by intracellular
digestion (phagocytosis) could be associated with a hypothetical trophic capacity. Improper use of oxygen persists
in this immune phase and is also associated with enzymatic stress. Furthermore, lymphatic circulation plays a
major role and macrophages and dendritic cells migrate to
lymph nodes where they activate lymphocytes [2,4,11]
(Figure 3).
It is considered that angiogenesis characterizes the last or
endocrine phase of the inflammatory response, so nutrition mediated by the blood capillaries is established
[2,4,5]. However, the angiogenic process becomes active
early and excessive proliferation of endothelial cells takes
place which, in turn, develops a great density of endothelial sprouts. Through this initial and excessive proliferation, the endothelial cells could successively perform
antioxidant and anti-enzymatic functions. These functions would favor the evolution of the inflammatory
response towards tissue repair through specialized capillary development. If so, it would be in this last phase of
the inflammatory response when the process of angiogenesis would be responsible for tissue nutrition through capillaries. Oxygen got its name from "Principe Oxygen"

http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/7/1/19

which means the acidifying principle."Oxy" is from Greek
and means sharp or acid; "gen" is also from Greek and
means the origin of. Taken together, oxygen means "the
origin of acid" [5]. Oxygen and oxidative metabolism are
an excellent combination through which cells can obtain
an abundant energy supply (energetic stress) for tissue
repair by epithelial regeneration or wound healing
[2,4,5,10,11] (Figure 3).
The color of the inflammatory phases
The colors of inflammation can be represented in three
groups:
- Cold colors
The tissue color that is initially associated with mechanical injury is white. When mechanical energy acts on the
tissue, especially if this occurs through a blunt etiological
agent, an abrupt crushing is produced that takes the blood
out of the tissue. The bloodless tissue is white, a color that
brings together the entire light spectrum, but if it continues to be crushed, it becomes ominous since it can signal
sphacelation. Thus, in a third-degree contusion, the tissue
suffers a crush injury with vasospasm, endothelial damage
and thrombosis [12] (Figure 1).

Decreased transcutaneous oxygen tension, reduced arterial hemoglobin saturation and increased transcutaneous
carbon dioxide tension revealed a reduction in blood flow
and poor tissue perfusion as the earliest warning signs of
shock and death [13]. Then, a shift to anaerobic metabolism is provided through the metabolic adaptation to
hypoxia. Again the paleness, in this case generalized,
implies a poor prognosis.
Blood loss remains a leading cause of traumatic death
[14]. Control of bleeding and correction of intravascular
volume are the hallmarks of conventional resuscitation
after massive blood loss [14]. After cardiopulmonary
resuscitation of trauma patients with cardiac arrest, the
survival rates are only 0% to 5% [15,16]. Cardiac resuscitation (chest compression without ventilation) by
bystanders is the preferable approach for resuscitation
[17]. In blunt and/or penetrating trauma patients efforts
should be withheld in case there is evidence of a significant time lapse since pulselessness, including lividity, rigor
mortis and decomposition [18].
Early care of the severely injured patient and intervention
for hypothermia, coagulopathy and acidosis, components
of the trauma triad of death, would improve shock resuscitation [19-21]. Since cardiac arrest is an evolutive injury,
it has been suggested that the optimal treatment is phasespecific and includes: the electrical phase (0–4 minutes),
the circulatory phase (4–10 minutes) and the metabolic
phase (beyond 10 minutes after cardiac arrest) [22]. In

any case, early initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation
is the most effective measure [23].
Inflammatory pain is caused by tissue damage [24] and its
pathogeny also seems to be phase-specific. Thus, after the
initial electrical phase, with upregulation of ionic channel
expression in the nociceptive circuits that causes the spontaneous neural firing [24,25], the following would be an
immune phase, with cytokines, chemokines and prostaglandins derived from glial and immune cells, acting as
pain mediators and modulators [26,27]. Lastly, in an
endocrine phase, neurotrophic factors, including nerve
growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor
(BDNF) and neurotrophins 3 and 4, would be associated
with structural neural remodeling [28]. If so, the velocity
in which the phases of inflammation are expressed in the
neural tissue would allow it to play a modulating role in
the post-mechanical injury inflammatory response in the
rest of the tissues and organs of the body.
An immediate component of the stress response to pain is
the efferent nervous response mediated by the somatic
motor and autonomic nervous systems [29]. The somatic
motor response usually consists in the withdrawal of the
affected part of the body from the source of irritation.
Withdrawal reflexes are the simplest centrally organized
responses to painful stimuli [30]. Furthermore, the fightor-flight response is the behavioral response to a threat, in
which the somatic motor response stands out [29]. With
respect to the autonomic nervous system, both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems participate in
inflammation. An early pathological motor response,
where the smooth muscular fiber is prominent, particularly in the vascular system, is triggered [2,4,10]. The
whey-face is one of the most visible consequences of these
vasomotor responses.
The vasomotor response with vasoconstriction, which collaborates in the production of ischemia and vasodilation,
cause the redistribution of the local vascular and systemic
blood flow. The intensity and duration of this ischemiareperfusion phenomenon will modify the color of the tissues and organs and will possibly determine their evolution during the subsequent inflammatory response. [2,4].
In this first phase of the inflammation, regardless whether
it is local or systemic, the tone or group of dominating
colors are those called cold colors, namely, blue and
green, which produce sedative effects. In particular, the
color blue, more or less dark, can be found after a
mechanical injury, both local (ecchymosis) and systemic
(cyanosis) (Figure 3).
The second-degree contusion initiates its evolution with
edema and ecchymosis (Figure 1). The initial dark blue

http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/7/1/19

color of the ecchymotic lesion comes from the carboxyhemoglobin, which is the result of the bounding of carbon
monoxide to hemoglobin. Then, the release of hemoglobin into the interstitial space is a phenomenon associated with hemolysis. Hemoglobin, released from red
blood cells, is the major source of heme for bile pigment
synthesis [31,32].
Heme is converted by heme-oxygenase (HO) forming
biliverdin, with blue-green color, carbon monoxide and
iron [32-34].
Three isoforms, HO-1, HO-2 and HO-3, are expressed in
most tissues. HO-1 is an inducible enzyme, also known as
heat shock protein 32, activated by oxidative stress and
cytokines [34]. HO-1 has antioxidant activity related to
the elimination of prooxidant heme, and to the antioxidant properties of biliverdin [34,35]. Interplay between
HO-1 and nitric oxide synthase systems has recently been
addressed. These systems share many common features
and overlap in biological functions. Particularly, HO
activity is involved in the inhibitory effect of NO on neutrophil migration to the inflammatory site [36].
HO-2 and HO-3 display a constitutive expression. HO-2
may have an essential role in the execution of self-resolving inflammatory-reparative processes [37]. HO-3 in turn,
has a great structural homology with HO-2 and acts as a
heme-sensing/binding protein [38]. HO-2 may also regulate the expression of HO-1 by modulating the cellular
heme level [39]. Therefore, the pathophysiological mechanisms as a whole that are established in second-degree
contusions due to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory
and reparative roles, would prevent the harmful evolution
of the lesion towards necrosis. In essence, the effects are
sedative where the expression of cold colors predominates.
Cyanosis, a word derived from the Greek term kyanos, is
the blue coloration of the skin, and the mucosas are frequently associated with the traumatic pathology that have
a systemic effect with hypoxia and hypotension [40,41].
Central cyanosis, with blueness of skin, lips and mucous
membranes is always a manifestation of hypoxemia. As a
result of hypoxemia an excess amount of hemoglobin is
not saturated with oxygen; in currently accepted terminology this unsaturated hemoglobin is said to be reduced
[42]. It is the quantity of reduced hemoglobin per deciliter
of capillary blood that accounts for the bluish color of cyanosis [43] (Figure 3).
- Warm Colors
During the immune phase of the inflammatory response,
the colors tend to be warmer. Thus, yellow coloration
arises.

The bruised tissue becomes yellowish because of the
emergence of bilirubin, a bile pigment [31]. Bilirrubin is
produced via reduction of heme-derived biliverdin by
biliverdin-reductase [31,32]. However, biliverdin-reductase, an evolutionarily conserved protein found across the
spectrum of metazoans, also serves in a catabolic pathway. Homologues of the reductase are found in unicellular organisms and plants [44,45]. Plants use biliverdin
produced by ferredoxin-dependent heme-oxygenase for
the synthesis of phytochromes, the sensory photoreceptors [44,45].
Biliverdin-reductase may function as a protein-kinase
[44]. Thus the functions are broadened since protein
phosphorylation by kinases and dephosphorylation by
phosphatases are essential components and mechanisms
of signal transduction in the cell [44]. So, biliverdinreductase plays an important role in mediating cytoprotective effects of HO-1 against hypoxia induced injury
[44,46]. Also the existence of a link between biliverdinreductase and the cytokine-activated stress signaling, suggest its main role in mediating the inflammatory response
[44].
Bilirubin has a number of new and interesting biochemical and biological properties [47]. In addition to having a
protective role against oxidative stress [47,48] bilirubin
also has antiapoptotic [47,49] and antimutagenic properties [49]. Therefore, the increase in the production of
bilirubin in the bruised tissue may have beneficiary effects
as an inflammatory modulator.
In the immune phase of the inflammatory response, the
interstitium is infiltrated first by platelets and later by leukocytes [5,50-52]. Acute inflammation following injury is
the site for abundant production of ROS by phagocytic
NADPH oxidase. In turn, this active oxidase is composed
of a membrane-bound cytochrome [5]. In these injured
tissues showing oxidative stress, and sometimes, symbiosis of the inflammatory cells and bacteria, the degree of
enzymatic stress could increase [11].
Pyogenic bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, makes the
inflammatory process yellow [53]. The genus Staphylococcus describes a grapelike cluster of bacteria found in pus
from surgical abscesses, since staphylo means grape in
Greek. Aureus is the species name, and means golden in
Latin, that is its characteristic surface pigmentation in
comparison with less virulent Staphylococci. Studies of the
Staphylococcus aureus pigment have unraveled a biosynthetic pathway that produces carotenoids, which are also
a type of plant coloring with antioxidants [53]. Although
this is not a tetrapyrrholic derived pigment, its situation in
the scale of warm colors is interesting.

http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/7/1/19

The formation of yellow, milky yellow, greenish yellow or
white-yellow pus characterizes suppuration or purulent
inflammation [54,55] (Figure 3). In addition to the
enzymes released by granulocytes during the process of
phagocytosis and bacterial killing, the bacteria themselves
produce a number of exoenzymes that cause tissue
destruction as well as localization of infection [56,57]. In
particular, almost all Staphylococcus aureus strains have the
ability to secrete an array of enzymes including nucleases,
proteases, lipases, hyaluronidase, and collagenase [57].
Matrix metalloproteinases would also collaborate in the
development of enzymatic stress in the acute inflammatory tissue injury [58,59]. Pus mainly contains necrotic tissue debris and dead neutrophils and, when the collection
of pus is localized, an abscess is established [56,57].
Compensation of the acute phase response includes the
production of positive acute phase proteins, like α2-macroglobulin, that binds proteolytic enzymes, and α1-antitrypsin and α1-antichymotrypsin, which are inhibitors of
leukocyte and lysosomal proteolytic enzymes [60]. Likewise, the natural inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases
(TIMPs) could promote antienzymatic stress [58].
Also, unconjugated bilirubin is a potent inhibitor of the
digestive proteases trypsin and chymotrypsin [61]. In the
gut, bilirubin glucuronides are deconjugated by beta-glucuronidase, which exists in the gut mucosa, and could also
be also found in some strains of bacteria such as
Escherichia coli and Streptococcus pyogenes. Therefore, it has
been accepted that a dramatic decrease of beta-glucuronidase-positive bacteria, which in turn results in impaired
inactivation of digestive enzyme from the pancreas in the
large intestine would favor the development of inflammation in this location [61,62].
The ability of Staphylococcus aureus to cause infection is
absolutely dependent on the acquisition of iron from the
host. Particularly, the most abundant iron source is in the
form of the porphyrin heme [63,64]. That is why it has
been suggested that the ultimate fate of exogenously
acquired heme in Staphylococcus aureus depends on the
intracellular and extracellular availability of both iron and
heme. It also plays a significant role in the infectious process [64].
The yellowish coloring of the skin and mucosas is called
icterus (or jaundice). This means yellowness, ikteros in
Greek. Postoperative jaundice is associated with elevated
serum bilirubin, mainly conjugated, above 3 mg per dl.
Although hyperbilirubinemia seems to be multifactorial,
perioperative hypotension and/or hypoxia are important
pathogenic factors in the development of postoperative
jaundice and multiple organ failure [65]. In patients with
sepsis and multiple organ failure, a serum total bilirubin

greater than 2 mg per dl is a significant factor in predicting
mortality [66].

mitochondrial membrane potential and arresting the cell
cycle through a prooxidant mechanism [49].

Jaundice is an important and transient clinical sign seen in
most healthy newborns. They have hyperbilirubinemia
but finding the cause is not often possible [67]. Nevertheless, increased concentrations of IL-1 beta in the colostrum from breast-feeding mothers whose infants had
neonatal jaundice has been demonstrated. Therefore,
cytokines could be involved in the pathophysiological
events that can lead to neonatal jaundice [68].

- Hot colors
Evidence shows that the intensity and duration of the
nervous and immune phases of the inflammatory
response condition the evolution of the last or endocrine
phase. Thus, oxidative and enzymatic stress, both which
dominate the initial phases of inflammation, according to
their intensity and duration, would regulate the type of
response that is produced during the final or endocrine
phase. [2,4].

However, the relation of the biliary pigments to infection
is ambivalent since increasing serum levels of biliverdin
and bilirubin were shown to be beneficial in the setting of
inflammation [69]. Thus, in a mouse model of endotoxemia, a single-dose administration of bilirubin, in addition to its antioxidant effects, also exerts potent antiinflammatory activity [69].
The maximum intensity of the immune response may be
reached when an associated systemic infection is produced. Failure of the intestinal barrier resulting in bacterial translocation worsens the systemic inflammatory
response syndrome in the polytraumatized patient, and it
is an important etiological factor of sepsis and multiple
organ failure [70-72].
Hypovolemic shock, severe hemorrhage or major surgery
lead to priming the host and the exposure to a posterior
bacterial stimulus can produce an excessive response to an
otherwise low-grade inflammatory trigger [73,74]. Most
likely a current definition of sepsis is too broad and
encompasses heterogeneous groups of patients suffering
similar but different immune syndromes that are historically grouped under the general diagnosis of sepsis [75].
Cholestatic jaundice also occurs in the setting of sepsis
[76]. Liver abnormalities in sepsis include cholestasis and
hyperbilirubinemia. Gram-negative infections used to be
the cause of cholestasis associated with sepsis [76]. Hyperbilirubinemia develops in sepsis particularly in the setting
of bacteriemia. Hyperbilirubinemia precedes positive
blood cultures in one third of cases [77]. Bile pigments
have apoptotic protective and proliferative effects in vitro,
therefore caution should be exercised when generalising
these functions or properties [49]. In addition to the possibility that bile pigments, like other porphyrins, interact
with and neutralise mutagens, they may also have unique
mechanistic effects that regulate cell apoptosis and carcinogenesis. The porphyrins, including biliverdin,
bilirubin, protoporphyrin, hemin and clorophyllin are
effective anti-mutagens. Particularly, bilirubin induces
apoptosis in adenocarcinoma cell lines by disrupting the

Platelets [78], mast cells [79], neutrophils [80,81], macrophages [82-84] and T cells [79,84] are characterized by
expert functions in assisting and modulating the inflammatory response. Even today the potential role of leukocyte-derived
neuropeptides
and
hormones
in
inflammation as a localized hypothalamic-pituitary-like
axis has been proposed [85]. As the inflammatory
response progresses, certain stop signals at appropriate
checkpoints prevent further edema production and leukocyte traffic into tissues [83,86]. The pro-inflammatory
mechanisms are counterbalanced by endogenous antiinflammatory signals, that serve to temper the severity
and limit the duration of the early phases, which leads to
their resolution [83,86,87]. It has been proposed that regulatory T cells (Treg cells) have evolved to provide a complementary immunological arm to a physiological tissueprotecting mechanism driven by low oxygen tension (i.e.
hypoxia) in inflamed tissues. The hypoxia-adenosinergic
pathways migth govern the production of immunosuppressive molecules that have already been implicated in
the activities of Treg cells. In this way, by virtue of acting
in hypoxic and extracellular adenosine-rich tissue, T reg
cells could exert their suppressive function with local
downregulation of immune response, inducing "immunodormancy", and protection of tissues from continuing
collateral tissue damage thus improving healing [88] (Figure 3).
However, the interstitium is considered as the battle field
where inflammation develops [2,4,5] and its equivalent
in tissues and organs is the stroma. At the same time, the
most abundant cell type of tissue stroma is the fibroblast,
an active heterogeneous population of cells [89]. Fibroblasts can modify the quality, quantity and length of the
inflammatory infiltration during the induction of the
inflammatory response [90]. Fibroblasts can also contribute to the resolution of inflammation by withdrawing survival signals and normalizing chemokine gradients,
thereby allowing infiltrating leukocytes to undergo apoptosis or leave the tissues through the draining lymphatics
[91]. Lastly, fibroblasts may also provide important positional cues for wound healing and tissue regeneration. In

addition to their role of producing an extracellular matrix,
they may facilitate angiogenesis by production and release
of growth factors [89].
The color red is the first of the solar spectrum and is
applied to the color of arterial blood, namely, when the
blood contains oxyhemoglobin (HbO2). The reflectance
spectra for human skin has a characteristic signature, due
to the absorption spectrum of oxygenated hemoglobin in
the blood, and provides leads about the evolution of primate color vision [92,93].
Oxyhemoglobin reaches the cells through the capillaries
as a result of angiogenesis. This process, with neoformation of capillaries, would characterize the last or endocrine phase of the inflammatory response [4,11]. The
relatively low solubility of oxygen combined with its rapid
consumption, puts cells that are more than a hundred
microns or so away from the atmosphere in the precarious
position of relying on the microcirculation to maintain
oxygen supply where an interruption in blood flow of
only a few minutes can be disastrous [93]. Metabolically
active tissues extract approximately 75% of all the oxygen
from the blood as it passes from arterial input to venous
output, resulting in significant intracellular gradients and
intratissue heterogeneity of oxygen [93]. The oxygen dissociation curve of hemoglobin, a respiratory linked protein, has profound clinical importance applicable to
numerous situations of health and disease, for example,
in the neonatal period, aging, anesthesia, surgery, hemorrhage and septic shock [94,95].
Flesh color is the common color of the tissues due to its
content of oxyhemoglobin. The ability to use oxygen,
when it is disassociated from hemoglobin in the oxidative
metabolism, is recovered when patients recover their capillary function and therefore, nutrition is mediated by
them in the so-called endocrine or late phase. This type of
metabolism is characterized by a large production of ATP
(coupled reaction), which is used to drive multiple specialized cellular processes (energetic stress) with limited
heat generation and it would determine the onset of healing [2,4,11].
Therefore, the blood cells that occupy the interstitial space
in this latter phase of the inflammatory response are red
blood cells [2,4]. To carry out this interstitial occupation,
the red blood cells are transported by the newly formed
blood capillaries [96] and, therefore, angiogenesis is considered to play the main role in this inflammatory period
[2,4,10,11] (Figure 3).
The best way to finish the post-traumatic inflammatory
response, both local or systemic, is with regeneration
since the tissue and/or organ physiology returns to their

http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/7/1/19

normal state [86]. Regeneration is a process known well
by the body since it is produced right afterwards and in
particular by the epithelial tissues. Regeneration could be
considered a good method of fighting against the energetic stress that the oxidative metabolism imposes on the
epithelial cells [4,11].
Recently, lipoxins, resolvins, protectins [97-99] and
vasoinhibins [100] have emerged as signaling molecules
that regulate many cell functions and ample evidence
emphasizes their role in the resolution of the inflammatory response [86]. Resolution is an active and tightly regulated process controlled by anti-inflammatory and proresolving mediators and cellular moities [86,98]. Emerging evidence now suggests that this process of resolution
initiates in the first few hours after an inflammatory
response begins [83]. Therefore, this process could be similar to other fermentation processes as in bread-, wineand cheese-making. In the first case the flour is mixed with
water, salt (edema, oxidative stress) and it ferments. Then
it is baked in the oven to obtain bread.
Like in a cooking recipe, it is possible that the final product of the post-traumatic inflammatory response depends
on how many components are used, like water, electrolytes, enzymes, pro-inflammatory cytokines, growth factors and hormones, as well as the time employed in each
phase of the elaboration.
The ideal result is the resolution of tissue and organ recovery to a normal state. Mammals have retained much of the
molecular machinery used by organisms such as salamanders, but their regenerative potential is only limited. In
part, this seems to result from the rapid interposition of
fibrotic tissue which prevents subsequent tissue regeneration [101]. However, there are other alternative solutions.
By default, an impairment of wound healing and chronic
hypoinflammation is produced. At the same time, by
excess, the healing is produced by repair with fibrous scar
or by fibroproliferative scars [51,84,101,102]. Chronic
non-healing wounds generally are due to ischemia and
multiple factors that contribute to their resistance to treatment [102]. Under conditions of chronic inflammatory
hypoxia, chronic ischemic tissue requires adequate
wound tissue oxygenation, among other factors, to
improve the healing proccess [5]. The fibrous scar is secondary to excessive traumatic tissue necrosis with formation of rosy granulation tissue [51]. Lastly, prolonged
inflammation in wounds contributes to the development
of fibroproliferative scars, in other words, keloids and
hypertrophic scars, both erithematous [103]. Free heme
plays a major role in the expression of chronic inflammation. It activates neutrophil functions and delays neutrophil apoptosis. For these reasons heme is considered a
pro-inflammatory molecule [104].

The fibrotic component of the wound healing response is
mediated by myofibroblasts or by cells that gain a myofibroblasts-like phenotype; their activities include the
abundant synthesis of fibrillar collagens [105]. In this
way, the remodeling of tissues by fibrosis could be a useful solution to combat the energetic stress associated with
the oxidative metabolism since the cellular content
diminishes and the metabolic demand increases the extracellular component of reduced vitality.

Color depends on light, which is a kind of energy that the
sun emits in the form of radiation [92,93]. The use of the
sun's light energy by photosynthetic organisms provides
the foundation for virtually all life on Earth [108].

During prolonged critical illness, lean tissue is wasted
despite feeding; a problem that often persists even after
the underlying disease has been resolved. In this chronic
phase of the critical illness, the wasting syndrome is associated with a neuroendocrine dysfunction characterized
by a hypothalamic rather than pituitary dysfunction
[1,2,106]. During the evolution of the nervous and
immune phases of the systemic inflammatory response,
the body loses its more specialized functions and structures. In this progressive deconstruction, there is a depletion of the hydrocarbonate, lipid and protein stores, as
well as multiple or successive dysfunction and posterior
failure or necrosis of the specialized epithelium, i.e., the
pulmonary, gastrointestinal, renal and hepatic ones
[2,4,107].

Photosynthetic pigments are categorized in three chemical groups: chlorophylls, carotenoids and phycobilins.
Chlorophylls are essential molecules of green algae and
land plants. They are responsible for harvesting solar
energy in photosynthetic systems but also influence processes, such as photosynthetic gene expression, growth
rates and cell-death [109,110] (Figure 4).

Photosynthesis efficiently converts light energy to electrochemical energy for oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions. The direct products of oxygenic photosynthesis are
carbohydrates and oxygen [108].

However, consumption of the substrate deposits and the
dysfunction or failure of the specialized epithelia of the
body could also represent an accelerated process of dedifferentiation [2,4]. The hypothetical ability of the body to
involute or dedifferentiate could represent a return to
early stages of development. Therefore, dedifferentiation,
although it means the risk of neoplastic transformation,
can also be a form of effective defense mechanism against
injury since it could make retracing a well-known route
possible, that is, the prenatal specialization phase during
the endocrine phase of the systemic inflammatory
response. This last phase of the inflammatory response
has the disadvantage that it develops in an extrauterine
environment without the functional support of the
mother with her placenta [2,4]. The elevated incidence of
post-traumatic stress syndromes would thus be explained
as a consequence of a frustrated recovery of homeostasis.
Tetrapyrrole molecules in physiology and pathology
- Light, pigments and life
The importance of color in the surgical pathology could
be attributed to the benefits for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. However, this coloring can also have
added-value related to its possible pathophysiological
importance. This possibility has not yet been fully discovered, which would allow us to better understand its meaning in Nature.

Protagonism of the Tetrapyrrole molecules in vegetal and animal kingdoms. Tetrapyrrole products allow
plants to use CO2and mammals to use O2. These molecules
in their color version take advantage of the solar spectrum,
produced by the dispersion of sunlight and so they would
play the main role in the origin of plant and animal life, and
therefore, in inflammation.

Thus, the chlorophyll biosynthetic and degradation reactions belong to the most important biochemical pathways
known [109]. However, in addition to chlorophylls, other
tetrapyrrole end products are synthesized through the
same pathway including heme, hemoglobin, myoglobin,
cytochromes, nitric oxide synthase, peroxidase and catalases [33,109].
Tetrapyrrole molecules, such as heme, are employed in a
number of biochemical processes in algae, plants
[108,109], bacteria [108,111] and mammals [112] and
therefore allow for establishing links between their
metabolism and functions [113].
This large functional capacity of the tetrapyrrole molecules, explains why plants, through photosynthesis and
mammals through respiration, are complemented in the
creation of increasingly more complex forms of life
[108,109,114,115]. Therefore, photosynthetic pigments
and oxygen on extrasolar planets are considered strong
biomarkers for detecting life [116].
- Pigments, oxygen and inflammation
Due to the major importance of the tetrapyrrole molecules in the evolution of life on Earth [108] we could also
presuppose that these molecules play a leading role, not
only in physiological situations but also in inflammation,
since this is a vital process for the body.

Inflammation has been linked to the nutritional alteration in affected tissues from ancient times. In 1877 Santiago Ramón y Cajal, to obtain his doctor's degree,
presented a manuscript titled Patogeny of the Inflammation,
(the original version can be read at the Complutense University Medical School Library, although it has also been
published in a facsimile edition) [117]. The future Spanish Nobel Prize winner cited the existence of disorders or
perturbations of the nutritional activity in the organic territory subject to irritation, seconding Virchow. These
authors considered that the essential phenomenon of the
inflammatory process was irritation of the cell, which
would be expressed by feeding the cell itself most actively,
while exaggerating its function and by cell genesis [117].
Thus, we have proposed that the sequence in the expression of progressively more elaborated and complex nutritional systems could hypothetically be considered the
essence of the inflammation, regardless of what its etiology or localization may be [2,4,5,10]. The successive
pathophysiological mechanisms that develop in the interstitium of tissues when they undergo acute post-traumatic
inflammation are considered increasingly complex
trophic functional systems for using oxygen. The expression of the nervous (excessive oxidative and nitrosative
stress), immune (enzymatic stress) and endocrine (ener-

http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/7/1/19

getic stress) functional systems during the inflammatory
response makes it possible to differentiate three successive
phases, which progress from ischemia, through a metabolism that is characterized by defective oxygen use (reperfusion, oxidative burst and heat hyperproduction), up to
an oxidative metabolism (oxidative phosphorylation)
with the correct use of oxygen that produces usable
energy. Hence, the incidence of harmful influences during
their evolution could involve regressing to the most primitive trophic stages, in which nutrition by diffusion (nervous phase) takes place. This is simpler, but also less costly
and facilitates temporary survival until a more favorable
environment makes it possible to initiate more complex
nutritional methods (immune and endocrine phases)
[2,4,10,11]. The ability of cells to adapt to hypoxia relies
on a set of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs)
that induce a transcriptional programme of genes that regulate cell survival and apoptosis, vascular tone and angiogenesis [118]. A metabolic adaptation to hypoxia involves
that cells switch from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism
("Pasteur effect"). By this mechanism the cell can continue to generate ATP and can try to meet the metabolic
demands [118]. The oxygen sensors in conjunction with
HIFs regulate various aspects of this metabolic adaptation
[118]. Endothelial cells, through their capacity of anaerobic metabolism, could tolerate the ischemia phase and,
indeed play an antioxidant role [119]
Thus, it is also tempting to speculate on whether the body
reproduces the successive stages from which life passes
from its origin without oxygen [120] until it develops an
effective, although costly, system for the use of oxygen
every time we suffer acute inflammation [4,10,11].
Oxygen availability is coupled with an increase in network
complexity beyond what is reachable by any anoxic network. It also highlights enzymes and metabolic pathways
that might have been important in the adaptation to the
oxic atmosphere produced only by a single biological
reaction: oxygenic photosynthesis. Therefore, a correlation between the increased organism complexity and the
development of the use of the atmospheric oxygen could
be established [120,121]. This correlation also seems to
exist in the evolutive phases of the inflammatory response
since progressive cellular and tissue complexity occur parallel to a gradual oxygenation process from ischemia, to
progressive reoxygenation until the correct revascularization by angiogenesis in the injured tissues (Figure 4).
Tetrapyrrole end products also accompany the evolution
of the inflammatory response from the beginning with
ischemia to the end with oxidative phosphorylation.
Thus, traumatic injury with cell damage and hemolysis
can lead to high tissue concentrations of free heme, causing oxidative stress [122,123] and chemotactic call for leu-

kocytes [122]. Catalase and peroxidase have an
antioxidative effect [33]. Biliverdin and bilirubin downregulate pro-inflammation [36,47-49,69]. Hemoglobin
transports oxygen in the erythrocytes and cytochrome-Coxidase is the terminal enzyme in the respiratory chain
which allows for the synthesis of ATP, where the energy of
food consumption and respiration is stored [124]. The
five different cytochromes in the respiratory chain constituting a family of colored proteins that are related by the
presence of a bound heme molecule whose iron atom
changes from the ferric to ferrous state whenever it accepts
an electron. Hemes in different cytochromes have a
slightly different structure and each cytochrome has a different affinity for an electron [5,33]. Therefore, it could be
considered that the continuous interaction of tetrapyrrole
molecules and oxygen, dominate the inflammatory
response and perhaps reflect the thorough control that
animal life should carry out with regards to this toxic cell
potential, which is oxygen. Perhaps this is why once oxygen reaches the capillaries of the new formed tissues,
whether by regeneration or by fibroplasia, the cells have
to pay a very high price to obtain energy, since they overly
increase their turnover (regeneration) or reduce energy to
the maximum, until acquiring a tissue with the least
amount of cells, and therefore, one with very little vitality
(fibrosis).
Potential clinical applications
Sir Alan Battersby recounts that chemists and biochemists
sometimes argue over coffee, each pressing the case for the
greater importance of one group of natural products relative to another. Of course, this is largely for fun since living things and their chemistry are so interlocked and
interdependent that (were it possible) elimination of any
one family of natural products would probably bring everything crashing down [125]. This outcome is certainly so
for tetrapyrroles since they are responsible "inter alia", for
oxygen transport (haem), electron transport (cytochrome
c) and most fundamentally, photosynthesis (chlorophyll)
(Figure 4). Indeed, without the chlorophylls and bilins
(e.g. Phycocyanin which acts as a light haverster in algae)
life as we know it should not exist on this planet [125].

That is why it could be considered that tetrapyrrole molecules would be closely related to the different types of
metabolisms exhibited by injured tissue during the
inflammatory response. In particular, different intermediate tetrapyrroles would correspond to each post-traumatic
metabolic state. Thus, through the regulation of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis genes, intermediates would be produced
[125,126] in the successive phases of post-traumatic
inflammation. Therefore, the assessment of color changes
in tissues, attributed to the pigment characteristics of several tetrapyrroles, would possess a value for diagnosis and
prognosis, and they would correlate with the metabolic

http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/7/1/19

level of the inflamed tissue. In essence, this correlation is
also produced in the plant kingdom. Thus, the color
changes that occur during foliar senescence have also
demonstrated that they are directly related to the regulation of nutrient mobilization and re-absorption from leaf
cells. Chlorophyll is degraded through a metabolic pathway that becomes specifically activated in leaf senescence.
Furthermore, bright autumn colors observed in the foliage
of some woody species have been hypothesized to act as a
defense signal to potential insect herbivores [127].
A multicolor digital image analysis system for simultaneous identification of the tetrapyrrole pigments in the
inflamed tissue and assessment of their metabolic activity
would constitute a diagnostic method of great interest
(see appendix). A rapid and simple multicolor image
analysis has been developed recently for simultaneous
identification of bacteria species and assessment of metabolic activity [128].
Undoubtedly, other alternatives would include experimental and clinical applications of metabolomics. Metabolomics, an omic science in biological systems, is the study
of global metabolite profiles in a system (cell, tissue or
organism) under a given set of conditions [129,130].
Metabolomics, when used as a translational research tool,
can provide a link between the laboratory and clinic, particularly because metabolic and molecular imaging technologies such as position emission tomography and
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging enable
the discrimination of metabolic markers non-invasively
in vivo [130]. Gas chromatography and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry are also important analytical
techniques for metabolomic analysis [129,131,132].
Therefore, the fusion of molecular/metabolic, and anatomical/morphological information could improve the
diagnostic accuracy in the identification and characterization of the successive phases of the post-traumatic inflammatory response in relation to the metabolism of
tetrapyrroles.

Conclusion
We could conclude that the close relationship that the
tetrapyrrole end products establish with oxygen to acquire
forms of life on Earth are based on oxidative metabolism.
This would also explain the tetrapyrrole end products
location in the successive phases of the inflammatory
response and so, phylogeny could be recapitulated
[5,133] (Figure 4). Furthermore, the profusion with which
nature uses tetrapyrrole derivates, including pigments in
virtually all living organisms on Earth [116,134], could
make possible their incorporation into our diagnostic and
therapeutic arsenal. Then, the final aim of their use in the
clinical area would be to achieve a similar efficiency in
maintaining our life, when threatening factors arise.
