Sex-biased dispersal promotes adaptive parental
effects
Emmanuelle Revardel1,2, Alain Franc1,3, Rémy J Petit1,3*

Abstract
Background: In heterogeneous environments, sex-biased dispersal could lead to environmental adaptive parental
effects, with offspring selected to perform in the same way as the parent dispersing least, because this parent is
more likely to be locally adapted. We investigate this hypothesis by simulating varying levels of sex-biased dispersal
in a patchy environment. The relative advantage of a strategy involving pure maternal (or paternal) inheritance is
then compared with a strategy involving classical biparental inheritance in plants and in animals.
Results: We find that the advantage of the uniparental strategy over the biparental strategy is maximal when
dispersal is more strongly sex-biased and when dispersal distances of the least mobile sex are much lower than
the size of the environmental patches. In plants, only maternal effects can be selected for, in contrast to animals
where the evolution of either paternal or maternal effects can be favoured. Moreover, the conditions for
environmental adaptive maternal effects to be selected for are more easily fulfilled in plants than in animals.
Conclusions: The study suggests that sex-biased dispersal can help predict the direction and magnitude of
environmental adaptive parental effects. However, this depends on the scale of dispersal relative to that of the
environment and on the existence of appropriate mechanisms of transmission of environmentally induced traits.

Background
Whether sessile or not, all organisms experience environmental heterogeneity. As a consequence, divergent
selection takes place, leading to local adaptation, unless
selection is opposed by the homogenising effects of gene
flow [1,2]. Local adaptation is defined by the difference
in performance between conspecific individuals of local
and non-local origins. If dispersal is sex-biased, intermediate situations arise with individuals having the parent of one sex (male or female) of local origin but not
the other. This could create suitable conditions for the
evolution of environmental adaptive parental effects,
with offspring selected to perform like their nearest,
locally adapted parent. Hence, sex-biased dispersal could
help predict the direction and magnitude of adaptive
parental effects.
In a sexually reproducing species, parental effects
occur when the phenotype of an individual is determined more strongly by one of its parents, beyond the
equal contribution expected from biparental inheritance
[3-5]. Parental effects are ubiquitous in nature and have

been detected at a wide range of traits both in animals
and in plants [5-10]. Parental effects can be due to
genetic, epigenetic, behavioural or cultural inheritance.
The corresponding mechanisms are extremely varied
and include cytoplasmic inheritance, segregation distortion, parental imprinting, transgenerational plasticity (as
the result of the transmission of information derived
from parental quality or parental environment), parental
care, or learning ability [3,11-14]. As a consequence,
research on parental effects is considered to be at the
forefront of the ongoing integration of development,
ecology and evolution [15-17].
Not all parental effects increase offspring fitness. In
vertebrates, the adverse effects on the fitness of offspring
of thousands of substances ingested by parents, such as
drugs, food additives, pesticides, metals, has been well
established [8]. Other parental effects can have positive
effects on offspring fitness, but regardless of the environment. However, a growing number of parental effects
have been described that contribute to offspring adaptation to local abiotic or biotic environmental conditions
[18-21]. For instance, in an understorey herb, Campanula americana, maternal light environment affects

offspring life history in ways that should increase their
fitness under similar light conditions [22,23]. In Sorghum bicolour, salt-treated mother plants produce a
higher proportion of salt-adapted offspring [24]. In
spruce, timing of budset is regulated by a memory of
temperature during zygotic embryogenesis, i.e., when
the seed is still attached to the mother, resulting in trees
that are better adapted to the climate where the mother
trees are growing [25,26]. In amphibians, local adaptation to water acidity is mediated by maternal effects
[27]. Examples involving biotic factors have also been
studied, especially cases of induced resistance. For
instance, wild radish plants damaged by herbivores during growth have been shown to induce resistance of the
plants’ progeny compared to controls, potentially contributing to local adaptation in infested areas [28]. Similarly, in yellow monkeyflower, herbivory damage on
early leaves induces increased production of glandular
trichomes on later leaves but also in the maternal progeny before they experience herbivory, a plastic response
that is likely adaptive [29]. In insects, there are many
examples of adaptive transgenerational responses to predators [30] or to plant host quality [e.g. [31]]. In vertebrates, one of the best-characterized cases of adaptive
maternal effects is transgenerational inheritance of
mothering style in rats. Adoptive offspring of mothers
with high or low levels of grooming and nursing have
predictable differences in DNA methylation at a glucocorticoid receptor gene promoter in the hippocampus
[32]. These epigenetic changes result in differential sensitivity to adversity and increase the probability of offspring survival to sexual maturity in the corresponding
environments [33]. Similarly, in humans, the increased
levels of insulin resistance in offspring of mothers
starved during pregnancy has been hypothesised to provide adaptation later in life in environments where
nutrition is poor, at the expense of increased diseases
risks, an interpretation that is however still debated [16].
Hence, environmental adaptive parental effects are the
focus of increasing attention. Yet, the origin of adaptive
parental effects remains poorly understood. Parental
effects are often considered to be physiological inevitabilities [21] or to represent a form of transgenerational
developmental noise [16]. For instance, anisogamy and
internal fertilization typically lead to greater maternal
than paternal effects. However, such explanations do
not account for the evolution of environmental adaptive
parental effects.
Recently, Galloway [22] and Galloway and Etterson
[23] proposed that environmental adaptive parental
effects could have evolved as a source of adaptive plasticity between generations. They argued that sex-biased
gene dispersal in plants should select for environmental
adaptive maternal effects in heterogeneous environments.

This is because young seedlings should experience an
environment more similar to that of their mother than to
that of their father, because in plants seed dispersal is
typically reduced compared to pollen dispersal. If local
environments were predictable across generations, environmental maternal effects could provide a mean for
maternal plants to adjust the phenotype of their offspring
and enhance its success in the environment that it is
likely to encounter. A similar idea was formulated by
Spencer and Clark [34] for genomic imprinting in mammals. These authors suggested that genomic imprinting,
a case of parental epigenetic effect [35], could have
evolved as a consequence of selection to become similar
to the mother. In mammals, dispersal is often malebiased [36,37]. If females are locally adapted, but not
newly immigrated males, it would be advantageous for
offspring of both sexes to resemble their mother more so
than their father [34].
Although the studies of Galloway [22] and Spencer
and Clark [34] outline a potentially general mechanism
for the origin and evolution of environmental adaptive
parental effects, they discuss it in a limited context (seed
plants in one case, mammals in the other) and do not
quantify the impact of asymmetric dispersal and habitat
structure on the intensity of selection for parental
effects. Here we present a simple model with a static
patchy environment and variable ratios of male to
female dispersal rates and use it to estimate the probability with which an offspring will reside in the same
habitat as its mother or father. This allows us to make
predictions as to when selection should favour the
emergence of adaptive parental effects. We contrast the
situation for plants, whose dispersal is intrinsically
asymmetric because they disperse their genes through
haploid pollen and diploid seeds, with that of other
organisms where dispersal is not constrained in the
same way. We then outline a strategy to test the predictions of the model by confronting them with findings
from empirical studies and discuss model limitations
and possible directions for improvement.

Results
Simulations were used to estimate the probabilities for
the offspring to reside in the same environment than
each of its parents, assuming two contrasted environments distributed regularly, as on a checkerboard (Figure 1). These probabilities depend on pollen and seed
dispersal, in plants, and on male and female dispersal, in
animals, which were varied relative to the scale of the
environmental patches. A simple exponential kernel was
used to model each dispersal curve, of parameter b. We
then compared the advantage of the strategy of maternal
or paternal transmission of fitness (Zm or Zp) relative to
the strategy of biparental inheritance of fitness, in the

case of maximum contrast between environments, as
detailed in the Methods section.
Plant model

In the plant model, when mean seed dispersal is close to
or lower than the size of environmental patches, there is
an advantage for a maternal mode of inheritance compared to biparental inheritance (Zm > 0, Figure 2). This
is especially true if pollen dispersal is high, but it holds
even when pollen dispersal is lower than seed dispersal.
If mean seed dispersal is much larger than the size of
environmental patches, there is no more advantage for
the maternal strategy (Zm ~ 0). There is no parameter
space where paternal inheritance is favoured by selection
(i.e., where Zm < 0), even when pollen dispersal is much
lower than seed dispersal. Zm is maximal (values close
to 0.25) when seed dispersal is close to zero (bs = 0.02)
and pollen dispersal close to the maximum (bp = 50),
which corresponds to the maximal probability for an
offspring to be in the same environment than its mother
but in a different environment from its father.
Animal model

On the contrary, in the animal model, the situation is
symmetric, with an advantage for maternal inheritance
(0 ≤ Zm ≤ 0.25) when females disperse less than males
and an advantage for paternal inheritance (-0.25 ≤ Zm ≤ 0,
i.e. 0 ≤ Z p ≤ 0.25) when males disperse less than
females (Figure 3). Zm is maximal (values close to 0.25)
when female dispersal is close to zero (b♀ = 0.02) and
male dispersal close to the maximum (b♂ = 50), which
corresponds to the maximum probability for an

offspring to be in the same environment than its
mother but in a different environment from its father.
Similarly, Zm is minimal (values close to -0.25) when
female dispersal is maximum (b♀ = 50) and male dispersal close to zero (b♂ = 0.02), which corresponds to
the maximal probability for an offspring to be in the
same environment than its father but in a different
environment from its mother.
Models comparison

A closer comparison between results for the plant and
the animal models indicates that a higher male/female
than pollen/seed dispersal ratio is needed to achieve the
same selective pressure in favour of the maternal strategy. For instance, for the maternal strategy to outperform the biparental strategy by 5%, male dispersal in
animals has to be about four times as large as pollen
dispersal for the same values of female and seed dispersal (for Z m ≥ 0.05 with b ♀ = b s = 0.68, it takes b ♂ ≥
4.78 but only bp ≥ 1) (Figure 4).

Discussion
Our goal was to clarify when environmental adaptive
parental effects (whether maternal or paternal) are most
likely to evolve as a consequence of sex-biased dispersal
and of the spatial heterogeneity of the environment, to
test predictions of previous verbal models. We identify
parameter space where either maternal or paternal
environmental effects are selected for. Two major points
emerge. First, the selective pressure to develop environmental adaptive parental effects is particularly high
when dispersal is strongly sex-biased, as suggested

Zm to reach 0.05, as a function of seed or female dispersal. For
similar seed or female dispersal, much higher male than pollen
dispersal values are needed to exert the same selective pressure in
favor of maternal effects, illustrating the high propensity of plants to
evolve maternal effects.

previously for plants [22]. This selective pressure
depends in a complex, non-linear way on the dispersal
of seeds and pollen (or males and females) relative to
the scale of the environment. Second, the results show
that in heterogeneous static environments, plants are
not expected to evolve environmental adaptive paternal
effects: genes that are transmitted from the male gamete
will be dispersed not only by pollen but also by seeds,
so, on average, they will be dispersed over larger distances than genes inherited maternally, which are dispersed only by seeds. In contrast, animals are expected
to evolve either environmental adaptive maternal or
paternal effects, depending on whether dispersal is
male-biased or female-biased. Another related difference
is that, for adaptive maternal effects to evolve in animals, male dispersal needs to be higher than female dispersal. Instead, in plants, adaptive maternal effects can
evolve even if pollen dispersal is lower than seed
dispersal.

located in an environment identical to its natal one. If
there were a larger set of environmental conditions,
then a larger fraction of dispersing offspring would
encounter a new environment (up to 100% if there are
as many environments as patches on the landscape).
The strategy whereby the fitness of the offspring is controlled by the environment of the least dispersing sex
could then in theory outperform the biparental strategy
by up to 50%, compared to only 25% in the current
model, when assuming maximum contrast between the
fitness of individuals in the two environments. Instead,
for less extreme contrasts between environments, the
selective pressure in favour of uniparental inheritance is
decreased proportionally.
Second, we considered a fixed environment. Previous
studies have shown that when environmental change is
rapid or cyclical, adaptive plasticity can evolve, ‘by eliminating the lag-time associated with de novo induction of
the phenotype in offspring’ [38]. In the case of adaptation
to environmental change, the rapidity of the response is
critical [16]. Hence, it would be interesting to relax the
assumption of static environment in our model and test
how this affects predictions for the evolution of parental
effects.
Finally, we did not consider physiological, developmental and genetic constraints [e.g. [39,40]. The model
only predicts, under relatively restrictive conditions
(including a fixed dispersal strategy), the potential for
environmental adaptive parental effects to evolve. In
practice, environmental parental effects (which imply
some form of memory) will evolve only if the mechanisms exist to store and transfer the relevant information
over generations. The parental environment can affect
the offspring fitness at two stages: before and after fertilisation (i.e. prezygotic and postzygotic effects). Postzygotic environmental parental effects are more direct
because they involve the developing offspring itself.
They are facilitated by the development of viviparity
(e.g. in plants and in mammals) and by parental care in
animals and resource provisioning in plants. Prezygotic
parental effects are necessarily more indirect. Moreover,
earlier work has shown that the evolution of parental
effects can be limited by genetic constraints such as
recombination rates [34]. These constraints need to be
kept in mind when attempting to check the predictions
of the model.

Model limitations

The model used made a number of assumptions that
should be borne in mind. Below, we outline some of
these limitations and discuss whether they could affect
its performance.
First, we considered only two contrasted environments
in the model. As a consequence, an offspring dispersing
far away from its parents still has a 50% chance to be

Prospects to test the predictions of the model using
empirical evidence

Parental effects have been described in a large number
of organisms, but comparable data are rare [but see
[14]]. Moreover, our model applies to environmental
adaptive parental effects, not to parental effects that are
maladaptive, neutral or that provide general rather than

Revardel et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:217
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/217

local selective advantage [21]. As many studies measure
parental effects without checking whether these are
adaptive, comparisons might not always be meaningful.
Moreover, because the relevant geographic scale of the
environment depends on the trait considered (e.g.
growth, drought tolerance, disease tolerance, etc.), the
selective pressure to develop parental effects should vary
depending on the trait [22]. Only data pertaining to the
same trait in the same environment are strictly comparable. Notwithstanding these difficulties, we outline
below some prospects to test the theory in plants and in
animals.
Plants

In plants, at the rangewide scale, historical levels of
pollen flow have been estimated to be at least an order
of magnitude larger than levels of seed flow [median of
the pollen-to-seed migration ratio = 17, ref. [41]]. The
strong asymmetry of pollen and seed dispersal distances, combined with the intrinsically biased dispersal
system of plants (only male gametophytes disperse)
and the sessile habit, suggest that environmental adaptive maternal effects should be large and paternal
effects virtually absent in plants. Maternal effects have
indeed been frequently reported in plants, whereas
paternal effects have been considered to be negligible
[e.g. [5]]. In the few studies were environmental paternal effects were detected, they were of limited magnitude and often equivocal [42], or were dependent on
an interaction with the maternal plant [43]. Hence, the
results are compatible with the expectation for an
absence of environmental paternal effects in plants.
However, the comparison appears unbalanced because
there are many physiological and developmental pathways by which maternal effects can arise in plants [e.g.
[44]], but few that could allow the evolution of any
kind of paternal effect. In fact, unlike in animals, the
only way whereby the plant paternal environment
could influence the offspring is prezygotic [45]. Hence,
the mechanisms by which paternal environments could
influence the offspring phenotype are necessarily indirect and limited [3,46]. To better evaluate the model’s
predictions, comparative studies should instead investigate if variation in the relative dispersal of pollen and
seed across plant species is associated with a corresponding variation in the intensity of maternal effects.
Interestingly, pollen/seed dispersal ratios are not universally large in plants. In particular, in autogamous
(i.e. predominantly selfing) plants, pollen dispersal is
lacking or is very limited [e.g., [47]], to the point that
gene flow should no longer be sex-biased. One could
therefore predict that outcrossed offspring of predominantly autogamous plants should display less (locally
adaptive) maternal effects than offspring of closely
related allogamous plants.

Animals

In most animals with separate sexes, dispersal of genes
originating from male and female gametes is not constrained as it is in plants. Hence, a greater diversity of
adaptive parental effects is expected, depending on
which sex is the main disperser. In particular, the model
predicts the evolution of adaptive paternal effects when
males are more philopatric than females (as well as the
opposite, i.e. the evolution of adaptive maternal effects
when females are more philopatric than males). Nevertheless, the mechanisms that could allow the expression
of paternal effects in animals, although not as unlikely
as in plants, are less numerous than those favouring the
expression of maternal effects. In particular, the only
universal difference between the two sexes, the size
difference between sperm and egg cells [48], already
represents a significant prezygotic obstacle for the development of paternal effects. By contrast, postzygotic
mechanisms are not so constrained. In particular, paternal care, which could lead to the development of at
least some paternal effects [14], has evolved repeatedly
in animals, including in polychaetes, hemipters, amphibians and birds, and at high frequency in sea spiders
and fish [49,50]. Previous reviews indicate that paternal
care is associated with site-attached behaviour by males
[e.g. [49,50]]. Hence, given that site-attached behaviour
by one sex should typically imply stronger philopatry for
that sex, the prediction that adaptive parental effects
will be biased towards the more philopatric sex is not
without substance, at least for traits that can be influenced by parental behaviour [14]. However, this reasoning merely suggests that the model is plausible and
worthy of further investigation.
In mammals, dispersal is often male-biased [36,37], so
maternal effects should predominate, according to our
model. In the only review available on the direction and
intensity of parental effects in animals (using literature
data on reciprocal crosses), mammals were indeed shown
to be characterized by strong maternal effects for a number of traits [14]. These findings are therefore compatible
with our model, but whether sex-biased dispersal is the
cause of this trend cannot be easily assessed, because of
the numerous physiological and developmental pathways
that facilitate maternal effects in mammals. Humans are
unusual among mammal, as about 70% of human societies practice some form of patrilocality [e.g. [51]], especially since the emergence of agriculture [52]. So in
humans, unlike in most mammals, adaptive paternal
effects are expected, provided that suitable mechanisms
exist that allow their expression. An interesting case is
that of surnames, which are inherited from the father in
many human societies [53]. Surnames are not without
consequence and can be locally adaptive [e.g. [54]]. This
example illustrates that adaptive parental effects can

Revardel et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:217
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/217

involve cultural traits and can respond rapidly to changing environments and sex-related dispersal patterns,
which could be useful to test our model.
In birds, there is a general pattern of female-biased dispersal [37], although several species show no sex-biased
dispersal and a few have male-biased dispersal [55].
Hence one would predict that adaptive paternal effects
should be more frequent in birds than in mammals.
There is a tendency for maternal effects to be weaker in
birds than in mammals [14]. However, most reports of
parental effects in birds still describe maternal, not paternal effects [56]. It seems therefore that anatomical, developmental and other constraints can be more important
than sex-biased dispersal in helping predict the direction
of parental effects. Note however that our model only
predicts the direction of locally adaptive parental effects,
not of all parental effects. While prezygotic paternal
effects might be rare in birds, postzygotic paternal effects
could be more frequent. An example of such locally
adaptive paternally transmitted feature in birds is males’
song, a learned behavior [e.g. [57,58]]. There is strong
evidence that local courtship song structure in male
house finches is associated with locally adaptive modifications of bill form, function, and development [59].

Conclusions
The above examples suggest that the model’s predictions,
although somewhat limited by the importance of developmental constraints, are testable. The comparisons
could focus on closely related species (or populations of
the same species). Ideally, a full analysis would imply systematic quantification of sex-biased dispersal and of parental effects for a few well-chosen traits and the use of
phylogenetically-based comparative approaches.
During the last years, a few studies have started to
explore the evolutionary consequences of sex-biased dispersal. For instance, Johnstone and Cant [60] and Gardner [61] have shown how sex-biased dispersal of adults
mediates the evolution of altruism. Guillon et al. [62]
showed that the combination of sex-biased dispersal of
gametes and variation of habitat quality modifies sex
allocation in animals as well as in plants, whereas Lopez
et al. [63] found that sex-biased dispersal in plants can
affect migration load. Our study confirms that sexbiased dispersal has potentially profound evolutionary
consequences that deserve further investigations. It also
contributes to the growing awareness that other routes
than pure biparental genetic inheritance can result in
adaptation to local environments [16,64].
Methods
Environment

The diversity of environments is often summarized in
binary form (wet versus dry, calcareous versus acidic,

Page 7 of 10

etc.). We therefore used a simple static and regular pattern with square cells as on a checkerboard, with two
alternating states, one for each environment, while
acknowledging that this is a rough simplification. The
size of each cell is arbitrarily set to one and is constant
across simulations. On the contrary, dispersal distances
(see below) were varied over several orders of magnitude
above and below cell size. Hence, dispersal distances are
expressed in relative scaling units compared to the
environment.
Dispersal function

Several dispersal kernel functions have been used to
model dispersal [65,66]. Some of the most frequently
used are the exponential, Gaussian, or power law functions. They differ in particular by the way the tail distribution is modelled [67]. For this first-order exploratory
approach, we have selected a simple kernel (exponential
function: f(x) = be-bx) for dispersal distances. This model
of dispersal has only one degree of freedom (b), allowing
to more easily explore the variability of the response.
However, we also made the calculations for the two other
classical dispersal kernels (Gaussian and power law), and
the findings were very similar to those obtained with the
exponential function (results not shown). In all cases, a
uniform random variable was used to select the angle of
dispersal. For such a work, we need to associate two dispersal curves (i.e. pollen and seed, for the plant model),
which is implemented by a convolution of both dispersal
curves. This is tractable in one dimension, but we could
not find an analytical solution in a plane (two dimensions). Therefore, our modelling work relied on a Monte
Carlo method, based on numerical simulations with a
high number of repetitions.
The plant model

Pollen and seed dispersal are considered to take place
on a two dimensional infinite plane. The point at the
origin of the x and y axes represents the location of the
father (since we are interested in relative distances,
the process is invariant through translations, and actual
locations do not matter). The dispersal of the pollen is
then simulated using the pollen dispersal function. The
arrival point represents the location of the mother. The
dispersal of the seed is then simulated using the seed
dispersal function, starting from the mother’s location.
The arrival point represents the location of the offspring
(Figure 1a). The “plant model” of dispersal is intrinsically asymmetric because a gene inherited through the
male gamete will be dispersed through the pollen and
then through the seed, whereas a gene inherited through
the female gamete will only be dispersed through the
seed. As a consequence, an offspring will (on average)
be closer to its mother than to its father.

inhabited by the father, the mother and the offspring,
respectively (0,0,0), (0,0,1), (0,1,0) and (0,1,1). We have
computed the numbers (n000, n001, n010, n011, called n1,
n2, n3, n4), corresponding to each of the four cases, with
n1 + n2 + n3 + n4 = 20,000. In the animal model, the sites
inhabited by the father, the mother and the offspring are
instead: (0,0,0), (0,1,0), (1,0,0) and (1,1,0), otherwise the
procedure is the same (Table 1).

The animal model

In contrast, in animals, dispersal of genes inherited
through the male gamete can be more restricted than
that of genes inherited through the female gamete, if
males are more philopatric than females, so that an offspring could (on average) be born nearer to the place of
origin of its father than to that of its mother. We therefore simulated another model in which the distance
between the offspring and its father was not constrained
by the position of the mother. In this case, the point at
the origin of the x and y axes represents the location of
the offspring and the position of the father and of the
mother are determined using a dispersal function for
the males and the females (Figure 1b). The distances
thus simulated correspond to the distance between the
mother’s and father’s place of birth and the offspring’s
place of birth, as when dispersal of animals is restricted
to the movement of juveniles from birth place to site of
first reproduction (natal dispersal).

Measuring the advantage of uniparental versus biparental
transmission of adaptive modifications

To evaluate the relative advantage of different mechanisms of inheritance of fitness-related characters, we consider three extreme strategies: maternal, paternal and
biparental inheritance. The “maternal” strategy corresponds to a scenario where the fitness of the offspring is
entirely determined by the mother’s environment. If the
mother’s environment is similar to that of the offspring,
then the fitness of the offspring is maximal (value of
one). If not, its fitness is given a value of a (with 0 ≤ a
< 1). Symmetrically, in the “paternal” strategy, the offspring fitness depends only on the correspondence of
the offspring environment with that of its father. In the
“biparental” strategy, the offspring fitness is determined
equally by the environment of the two parents. It is
equal to one if both parents are located in the same
environment as the offspring, (1+ a)/2 if only one of the
two parents is located in the same environment than
the offspring, and a if none of the parents are located in
the same environment than the offspring. Predicted offspring fitness under each scenario is displayed in Table
1 for the plant and animal models. The probability of
each of the four possible configurations of environments
for mother, father, and offspring (obtained through
simulations) is multiplied by the corresponding fitness
of the offspring under each strategy of transmission of
fitness. The average adaptive value of each strategy (wm,
w p and w b ) is obtained by computing the sum of the
four products (probability of each configuration multiplied by its corresponding fitness, as indicated in

Running the simulations

Each dispersal parameter b was varied from 0.02 to 50 (i.
e. up to 50 times smaller and 50 times larger than the
characteristic scale of the environment), using a homogenous logarithmic increase, with 20 steps (i.e. the ratio
between two consecutive values is constant). The total
number of combinations of pollen and seed dispersal
parameters (bp and bs) and of male and female dispersal
parameters (b♂ and b♀) amounts to 441 cases (21 × 21).
For each pair of dispersal parameters, 20,000 runs were
implemented (total of 8.82 millions runs for each of the
two models). In all runs, the state of the cells occupied by
the father, the mother and the offspring were compiled.
Sites are labelled 0 and 1 as for any binary state. In the
plant model, assuming that the father always lives in the
same site does not lead to a loss of generality. Similarly,
in the animal model, assuming that the offspring always
live in the same site does not lead to a loss of generality.
For instance, in the plant model, the father is always in
state 0. There are then four possibilities for the sites

Table 1). The relative advantage of the maternal strategy
over the biparental strategy, noted Zm, is:
Zm = wm − wb

= [p1 + p4 +  (p2 + p3)] − [p1 +  p2 + (1 +  )(p3 + p4) / 2]
= (1 +  )(p4 − p3) / 2

11.

Similarly, the relative advantage of the paternal strategy over the biparental strategy, noted Zp, is:

12.

Zp = wp − wb
= [p1 + p3 +  (p2 + p4)] − [p1 +  p2 + (1 +  )(p3 + p4) / 2]
= (1 +  )(p3 − p4) / 2

Therefore, as expected, the relative advantage of the
maternal strategy (Zm) is opposite to that of the paternal
strategy (Zp). Moreover, both Zm and Zp are strictly proportional to the difference in fitness between the two
environments (1 – a).
