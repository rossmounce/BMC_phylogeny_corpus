Abstract
Background: The time it takes to isolate individuals from environmental samples and then extract
DNA from each individual is one of the problems with generating molecular data from meiofauna
such as eutardigrades and bdelloid rotifers. The lack of consistent morphological information and
the extreme abundance of these classes makes morphological identification of rare, or even
common cryptic taxa a large and unwieldy task. This limits the ability to perform large-scale surveys
of the diversity of these organisms.
Here we demonstrate a culture-independent molecular survey approach that enables the
generation of large amounts of eutardigrade and bdelloid rotifer sequence data directly from soil.
Our PCR primers, specific to the 18s small-subunit rRNA gene, were developed for both
eutardigrades and bdelloid rotifers.
Results: The developed primers successfully amplified DNA of their target organism from various
soil DNA extracts. This was confirmed by both the BLAST similarity searches and phylogenetic
analyses. Tardigrades showed much better phylogenetic resolution than bdelloids. Both groups of
organisms exhibited varying levels of endemism.
Conclusion: The development of clade-specific primers for characterizing eutardigrades and
bdelloid rotifers from environmental samples should greatly increase our ability to characterize the
composition of these taxa in environmental samples. Environmental sequencing as shown here
differs from other molecular survey methods in that there is no need to pre-isolate the organisms
of interest from soil in order to amplify their DNA. The DNA sequences obtained from methods
that do not require culturing can be identified post-hoc and placed phylogenetically as additional
closely related sequences are obtained from morphologically identified conspecifics. Our noncultured environmental sequence based approach will be able to provide a rapid and large-scale
screening of the presence, absence and diversity of Bdelloidea and Eutardigrada in a variety of soils.

Background
Micro-invertebrates, though very important to the soil
biocenose (self-regulating ecological communities) and
energy flux of a system, are still poorly understood in
terms of their taxonomy and geographical distributions
[1-4]. Like many microfaunal organisms, Rotifera and Tardigrada pose problems for taxonomists and evolutionary
biologists due to the difficulties associated with isolation,
identification and enumeration of organisms that do not
preserve any discernable morphological characters. Even
when it is possible to successfully culture these organisms,
limited phenotypic differentiation among taxa and cyclomorphosis (seasonal change in body shape; [5]) confound accurate taxonomy. This lack of consistent
morphological information and the extreme abundance
of meiofaunal organisms makes identification of rare, or
even common, cryptic taxa a large and unwieldy task [6,4]
as only painstaking microscopy can be used to identify
synapomorphies.
Environmental sequencing is valuable for performing
large-scale surveys of the diversity of organisms that cannot be cultured or grown in the laboratory or when species are difficult to distinguish using phenotypic
characters. These issues argue for culture independent
molecular surveys of meiofaunal diversity in natural ecosystems. Microbiologists have faced many of the same
problems and solved them by turning to conserved DNA
sequences as a means of describing communities [7,8].
Instead of isolating and culturing individuals, communities are characterized by extracting all of the DNA in a particular sample (soil, water, air), amplifying a specific gene
using PCR, cloning individual PCR products, and then
sequencing individual clones. This environmental DNA
approach has revolutionized microbiology. For example,
these techniques have been successfully used to provide
new insights into fungi [9,10], novel Chloroflexi [11],
abundance and distribution of Psychrobacter and Exiguobacterium [12] and have been used to provide information
about the structure and function of alpine and arctic soil
microbial communities [13].
Our survey focuses on the 18S rRNA gene, commonly
used for phylogenetic inference of eukaryotes due to its
highly conserved sequence and ability to resolve relatively
deep nodes. This is the first description of the general utility of environmental DNA sequencing approaches for
characterizing difficult to study ecological communities of
eutardigrades and bdelloid rotifers.
Environmental sequencing as described here differs from
other molecular survey methods [6,14] in that there is no
need to pre-isolate the bdelloid rotifers or eutardigrades of
interest from soil (or other mediums) before amplifying
their DNA. The successful development of clade-specific
18s SSU primers has shown to be effective when surveying

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/9/25

the diversity of targeted groups of organisms. For example, clade specific 18s SSU primers have been used to
describe soil metazoans[15,16] and reveal the hidden
diversity and biogeographic endemism of kinetoplastids
(flagellate protozoa) [17].
The use of 18S rDNA allows for sequences to be combined
into already existing 18S and 16S rDNA databases, including those being developed by microbial ecologists
through their large scale molecular surveys as referred to
above. Here we describe the utility of screening for bdelloid rotifer and eutardigrade diversity in two very distinct
sample sites with targeted 18S primers: the high-elevation
sites located within the Niwot Ridge Long Term Ecological
Research (LTER) site in the Colorado Rockies, and the
low-elevation sites located within the Calhoun Experimental Forest in South Carolina.

Results
We developed two forward primers for taxon specific
amplification of eutardigrades and bdelloid rotifers. These
primers were used in combination with a universal reverse
18S rDNA primer to specifically characterize the diversity
of these two groups from several environments. PCR,
BLAST and phylogenetic analysis confirmed that each set
of primers amplifies the targeted groups with fidelity and
specificity (Figures 1 &2). We have observed many invertebrates within the soils prior to DNA extraction and
amplification, including mites, nematodes, and insects;
none of these were observed within the sequencing data
produced using the specific primers in this study. Thus,
our primers are shown to be specific to the targeted groups
of organisms. The closest known sequences or clades to
the environmental sequences are noted below. Note that
we do not infer that the environmental sequences are of
the same species or genera to those closest to them.
Tardigrada
Out of 1,814 nucleotide positions there were 900 variable
sites, of which 677 were phylogenetically informative,
comprising 68 unique phylotypes. Phylogenetic analysis
clearly separates the two main groups of tardigrades: the
Heterotardigrada and the Eutardigrada (Figure 3). Many
of the environmental sequences from the high-elevation
talus sites clustered into distinct clades, suggesting each
clade may comprise a separate species. Eutardigrade
sequences from soils near the Arikiree Glacier (AGL)
grouped within the Macrobiotoidea and Hypsibiodea
groups. Those within the Macrobiotidea are most closely
related to Richtersius coronifer, a cosmopolitan species
sampled from high elevation and arctic habitats [18]. The
AGL sequences that grouped within the Hypsibiodea are
related to those of the englacial dominating Hypsibius
genus. These Hypsibius sequences from the AGL site are
nearby and grouped with the two talus sites (T1T2 &
T3T6).

clades within Clade A (Sub A) is mainly dominated by
sequence types from the T1T2 site. The second clade
(Clade B) is dominated by those sequences from the Calhoun sites. What is interesting here is that the most

derived cluster within Clade B contains uncultured
sequences from Japan (Ibaraki upland soils) along with
sequences from a high elevation site in Socompa, South
America (Sub B) [23].
The final main group of sequences, Clade C, contains
sequences from several locales, but mostly those from the
AGL site. Again, like in Sub B, we observe uncultured
sequence data from Japan (Fukushima and Ibaraki) clustering with a sequence from Socompa.
The lack of 18S rDNA sequence information in online
data bases (14 bdelloid sequences in GenBank [24] as of
this writing), makes the identification of environmentally
obtained sequences even more difficult.

Discussion
The development of clade-specific primers that allows
characterization of eutardigrade and bdelloid rotifer communities from environmental samples should greatly
increase our ability to discern the community diversity of
these taxa in environmental samples. Moreover, the rDNA
sequence data can be directly stored (within software
packages like ARB [25]) and compared with other surveys
that attempt to characterize invertebrate community composition [16,26].
We anticipate that environmental DNA surveys using
clade-specific primers, like those we have developed, will
be used to complement more directed studies that cultivate individual micro-eukaryotes as a means of more fully
describing the diversity of ecological communities. We
have yet to assess whether isolation of individuals and
environmental DNA surveys yield different estimates of
community composition, as is the case for surveys of bacteria (but see [16,26]) and bdelloid rotifers [27].
Environmental sequencing as shown here differs from
other molecular survey methods [6,14,16,26] in that there
is no need to pre-isolate the organisms of interest from
soil (or other media), in order to amplify their DNA. Here,
we simply extract total cellular DNA from all organisms in
the soil and use targeted primers for the group of interest.
This allows for a single DNA extraction prep instead of
one DNA extraction prep for each targeted organism of
interest.
Eutardigrada
Although there are too few data to make robust biological
inferences, several results are noteworthy. We found
sequences from the highest elevation site in Colorado
(near the Arikiree glacier) that grouped together with R.
coronifer, a cosmopolitan morpho-species known to exist
in high mountain and arctic habitats which is also known
to survive extreme desiccation and temperatures down to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/9/25

-196°C [28]. Additionally, several sequences from the
Calhoun hardwood forest were very similar to Isohypsibius
papillifer, a widespread European species. Moreover, the
genus Isohypsibius is ubiquitous, distributed from North
America, Northern Europe, and Asia, all the way to Antarctica.
Interestingly, the sequences from the AGL site seem to
have the most distant set of sequences compared to the
other sites. One set of sequences is from within the Macrobiotidae, Richtersius group and the other from the Hypsibiodea, Hypsibius group. This is probably due to the longer
duration of moist and wet soils that allows for a greater
diversity of eutardigrade groups.
It is not too suprising that the majority of the Eutardigrade
sequences amplified from the Talus and glacier sites are
dominated by Hypsibius-related sequences. The Hypsibidae are known to dominate englacial habitats and are the
dominate family of polar and cryoconite tardigrades.
Hypsibius species are hydrophilic and are composed of
bacteriophagous and/or algivorous feeding types. These
biological factors aid in the colonization of nunatuks and
glacial habitats (as reviewed in [29]).
However, several sequences from the Macrobiotidae were
also found within the glacial habitat of the AGL site.
Macrobiotidae are traditionally considered cosmopolitan
occurring in many habitats, including those that are periodically frozen [29]. The AGL sequences cluster closest to
the known sequences of Richtersius sp. (Figure 3). Richtersius have been the focus of many anhydrobiosis studies
and have shown significant improvements in desiccation
survival when many individuals aggregate together during
anhydrobiosis [30]. This could lead to positive density
dependence and even allow these animals to achieve
greater monopolization [as reviewed in [31]] to local habitats that encounter extreme desiccation events like the
high elevation AGL and talus sites. However, aggregation
can create problems with environmental sequencing strategies like the one proposed here. If aggregation in the wild
occurs within other eutardigrade groups then environmental sequencing may lead to amplification of only
those extremely high-abundant clusters of animals.
Bdelloidea
In contrast to the tardigrades, there was less agreement of
support between the two different phylogenetic reconstruction methods of Bayesian and parsimony analysis for
bdelloid rotifers. It was not possible to identify what bdelloids the environmental sequences were related to due to
lack of abundant reference sequences. However, while it
was possible to make some general statements about the
bdelloid communities at the listed sample sites, the lack
of resolution of 18S rDNA compared to 28S rDNA [32]

makes it difficult to delineate the more recent clades of
Bdelloidea (Figure 4). In fact, a similar level of poor resolution of bdelloids is also seen from phylogenies produced via cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 sequence data,
wherein the early nodes are mostly saturated with polytomies (Robeson & Birky unpublished). Better resolution of
this group at the tips of the phylogeny is often seen regardless of the phylogenetic reconstruction method chosen.
It is interesting that sequences from Socompa [23] cluster
with the Calhoun sequences as opposed to other high elevation sites like the dry Talus, in Niwot Ridge. Although
Socompa is a very high elevation site (5824 m above sea
level), it is most likely similar in its microhabitat to the
Calhoun sites, where there is greater moisture compared
to the dry Talus. The Socompa site is characterized as a
fumerole environment [23]. Typically fumaroles are areas
where steam and volcanic gases vent out of the earth's
crust due to the degassing of magma and/or geothermal
heating of shallow ground water. This particular fumerole
site is weakly active, creating an environment in which
communities of mosses and liverworts are sustained by
warm water vapor. The potentially similar microhabitats
may be the reason for finding such similar sequence types
in very different locales.
Bdelloid rotifers in particular show evidence for geographic structure among clades. Whether this apparent
pattern reflects environmental filtering, priority effects
(differences in arrival time that can have a lasting effect on
differences in species dominance), or some other process
remains to be seen. Nonetheless, the data presented here
support the contention of [33], in which instances of
endemism are seen (Clade A & B), with a few phylogenetic
clusters of widespread bdelloids sampled from very different locales (Clade C and Sub B). It may be that harsher
conditions in which there are very ephemeral moments of
soil moisture creates higher levels of endemism of bdelloids, whereas environments in which soil moisture is sustained for longer periods of time allow for increased
chances of long distance dispersal to suitable habitats and
persistence. The location of the Socompa fumerole sites in
the phylogeny (Figure 4) and its high similarity to
sequences from Japan and within the Calhoun sites
(Clade B & C) may be an indication of the latter point.
One caveat here is that the 18s rDNA sequences are more
conserved than their cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 counterparts [4,33] preserving more ancient than contemporary relatedness.

Conclusion
Large-scale surveys of rotifer and tardigrade diversity using
traditional approaches makes for a large and unwieldy set
of tasks (i.e. difficulties associated with isolation, identification and enumeration of organisms that do not preserve
any discernable morphological characters).

Environmental sequencing is valuable for performing
large-scale surveys of the diversity of organisms that cannot be cultured or grown in the laboratory or in which
species are difficult to distinguish using phenotypic characters. The DNA sequences obtained from non-cultured
based methods can be identified post-hoc (placed phylogentically) as closely related sequences are obtained from
morphologically identified conspecifics. Our environmental sequence based approach, which does not require
culturing or isolation of animals from soils, provides a
rapid and large-scale screening for the presence, absence
and diversity of Bdelloidea and Eutardigrada in a variety
of soils.
We have shown that targeted amplification of eutardigrades and bdelloid rotifers are possible from a range of
soil types. This sequence data can be used to quickly assess
the peculiar biogeography [31,34] and genetic diversity of
soil samples, more often informing us of dominate
groups within each sample.
It should also be emphasized that environmental
sequencing strategies like this are not intended to replace,
but instead complement ongoing morphological work,
explore the possible effects of heterogeneity within individuals, and the effect of this variation on phylogenetic
analysis [35]. This highlights the need for morphological
taxonomists and molecular ecologists to work together in
order to make environmental sequencing methods, like
the one proposed here, more robust. In particular, studies
such as these are most empowered by the cataloging of
sequence data from vouchered specimens.

Methods
Soil DNA extraction
Soil samples (~5 g) were taken from all sites. Three sites
from within the Niwot Ridge Long Term Ecological
Research (LTER) area in the Front Range of the Colorado
Rocky Mountains, United States of America (40° 03' N,
105° 35' W). These sites are: the Arikiree Glacier (AGL),
Talus site 1 (T1T2), and Talus site 2 (T3T6) as described
previously by [36]. Other soil samples were also obtained
from the Calhoun Experimental Forest (managed by the
US Department of Agriculture located in northwestern
South Carolina in the Piedmont region, 34.5°N, 82°W),
these sites are: Hardwood (H), Grassland (G), and Cultivated (C). Total cellular DNA was extracted from soil
using the PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit #12888 (Mo Bio
Laboratories, Inc, Carlsbad, CA).
Primer development
Only forward 18S SSU primers were developed to target
specific groups (bdelloids and eutardigrades). Primer
development entailed downloading all available target
sequences of interest along with their closest set of outgroup taxa from GenBank [24] and aligned using Muscle

The reverse primer 18S2a was used in conjunction with
either the Tard_1 or Bdel_2 primer in order to amplify the
DNA of either eutardigrades or bdelloid rotifers directly
from soil. The PCR cycling conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 94°C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles
of: 94°C for 30", 60°C for 30", 72°C for 2', with a final
extension at 72°C for 10'. PCR reaction contained (all reagents from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) 1× PCR Buffer,
1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 μM dNTPs, 0.4 μM of each primer, Taq
polymerase (0.5 units), template DNA: 2 μL.

where chimera-checked using the Bellerophon server [41]
and determined that no chimeras by sample site amplicons were detected. Usable data were then exported for
BLAST [42] searches. All sequences produced and/or used
in this study are listed by accession in Table 1.

Pre-aligned guide and outgroup sequences were downloaded from the SILVA database [43]. The SILVA aligner
was used to align the environmental 18s rDNA SSU
sequence data according to secondary structure [43]. The
data was further edited by eye and exported from ARB [25]
using an 'in-house' filter to remove highly ambiguous
regions of the alignment. All terminal gaps in the alignment were converted to missing (i.e. as '?' characters) and
gaps '-' counted as a 5th character state. TNT [44] and a
multi-core version of MrBayes [45] were used to confirm
the phylogenetic placement of environmentally obtained
sequences. Parsimony analysis was performed by generating 1000 bootstrap replicates. Before re-sampling, the
trees were collapsed using TBR. Each bootstrap replicate
was composed of twenty iterations of 'Wagner addition
trees' (trees formed by sequentially adding the taxa at the
best available position, using Fitch parsimony) followed
by swapping with TBR, the single best tree was then used
for random sector searches and trees saved. MrBayes was
used to perform 5 and 8 million generations using the
GTR + G + I model of evolution as specified by MultiPhyl
Online on the bdelloid and eutardigrade data sets respectively [46].
