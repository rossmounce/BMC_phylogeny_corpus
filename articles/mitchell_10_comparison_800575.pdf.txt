Comparison of koala LPCoLN and human strains
of Chlamydia pneumoniae highlights extended
genetic diversity in the species

Abstract
Background: Chlamydia pneumoniae is a widespread pathogen causing upper and lower respiratory tract
infections in addition to a range of other diseases in humans and animals. Previous whole genome analyses have
focused on four essentially clonal (> 99% identity) C. pneumoniae human genomes (AR39, CWL029, J138 and
TW183), providing relatively little insight into strain diversity and evolution of this species.
Results: We performed individual gene-by-gene comparisons of the recently sequenced C. pneumoniae koala
genome and four C. pneumoniae human genomes to identify species-specific genes, and more importantly, to gain
an insight into the genetic diversity and evolution of the species. We selected genes dispersed throughout the
chromosome, representing genes that were specific to C. pneumoniae, genes with a demonstrated role in
chlamydial biology and/or pathogenicity (n = 49), genes encoding nucleotide salvage or amino acid biosynthesis
proteins (n = 6), and extrachromosomal elements (9 plasmid and 2 bacteriophage genes).
Conclusions: We have identified strain-specific differences and targets for detection of C. pneumoniae isolates from
both human and animal origin. Such characterisation is necessary for an improved understanding of disease
transmission and intervention.

Background
The Chlamydiaceae are obligate intracellular pathogens
that undergo a unique biphasic developmental cycle
involving the inter-conversion between the extracellular
infectious elementary body and the intracellular, replicative reticulate body. Chlamydia ‘Chlamydophila’ pneumoniae is probably one of the most successful
chlamydial species, having established a niche in a range
of warm-blooded (homoeothermic) and cold-blooded
(poikilothermic) hosts, including humans, horses, marsupials, frogs and reptiles [1-5]. C. pneumoniae human
infections are associated with bronchitis, pharyngitis,
community-acquired pneumonia and more recently
chronic diseases, such as atherosclerosis and stroke [6,7]
myocarditis [8], multiple sclerosis [9] and Alzheimer’s
disease [10].

Australia’s native icon, the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus), is found throughout Australia’s north-eastern and
southern eucalypt regions and is commonly infected
with chlamydiae [11-14]. While the decline in koala
populations has largely been the result of hunting and a
diminished habitat, there is great concern for the koala
due to an increased incidence of disease [15]. It is estimated that almost all of the nations free-range koala
populations and many in captive populations are
affected by C. pneumoniae and/or C. pecorum (the most
common of the two species). C. pneumoniae-infected
koalas may develop a respiratory illness similar to that
in humans with clinical signs of sneezing, coughing,
nasal discharge and chest congestion [16,17]. C. pneumoniae koala is not restricted to the respiratory tract
and has been isolated from ocular and urogenital tract
sites (often in conjunction with C. pecorum), although
disease at these sites is poorly understood [13].
Exposure to C. pneumoniae is widespread due to
effective aerosol transmission and outbreaks have been
reported in humans [18-21], horses [22], frogs [23] and

koalas [13]. However, the original source of infection
remains undetermined. Myers et al. [24] recently published the full 1.24 Mbp genome sequence of the
C. pneumoniae koala LPCoLN isolate, the first analysis
of a C. pneumoniae genome from a non-human host
species. This study revealed that the five C. pneumoniae
genomes were highly similar in genomic organisation
and gene order, although some notable differences were
observed [24]. In contrast to the highly conserved
human-derived isolates, a relatively high number of single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs (6213) differentiated koala LPCoLN from human AR39 [24]. In the
proposed phylogeny (based on SNPs from 111 highly
conserved genes), which encompassed all five C. pneumoniae genomes and five sequenced animal chlamydial
genomes (C. pecorum E58, C. muridarum Nigg,
C. caviae GPIC, C. psittaci 6BC and C. abortus s26/3),
koala LPCoLN was basal to the C. pneumoniae human
isolates (larger genome and many full-length genes relative to human isolates).
In the present report we perform a comparative analysis of the whole koala LPCoLN genome sequence, highlighting the components that distinguish the strain
isolated from the koala (animal), from those isolated
from humans. These comparisons point to candidates of
strain-specific adaptations and may provide potential
targets for improved diagnostic tests, therapeutic intervention and epidemiological investigations.

Results
We used a comparative genomics approach to identify
genetic characteristics that were either unique to
C. pneumoniae or were commonly shared with chlamydial species and other organisms. Overall, we analysed a
total of 66 genes for key similarities and differences
between human and animal strains of C. pneumoniae
(see Additional file 1 for list of 66 genes analysed). We
chose to use our C. pneumoniae animal genome as the
reference genome and compared the available human
genomes to it.
Chlamydia pneumoniae-specific genes

Using tblastx and tblastn, we searched other genomes
for orthologs of the genes identified from individual
gene-by-gene comparisons of the five C. pneumoniae
genomes. The comparative approach identified
140 genes that were specific to C. pneumoniae and for
which no significant similarity was detected in any other
organism (Additional file 2). Many of these speciesspecific genes are short open reading frames (ORFs)
that have been annotated as genes. The large number of
short hypothetical ORFs makes it difficult to determine
whether these genes are ‘real’ or artefacts of the genome
annotation or sequencing process. Until these proteins

Page 2 of 10

are systematically studied in the future, it cannot be
determined whether these proteins are valid or too
short to be protein-coding genes. Genes with suggested
or predicted functions include putative lipoproteins and
chlamydial inclusion membrane proteins (IncA). Several
hypothetical proteins are clustered together (including
CPK_ORF00340-343, 389-401, 496-498, 567-569,
658-661, 969-980: LPCoLN locus designation, CPK),
suggesting that they may exist in an operon and might
be functionally related.
Genes with a demonstrated role in chlamydial biology
and/or pathogenicity

One of the most striking differences between the
C. pneumoniae koala and human genomes were changes
associated with the polymorphic membrane proteins
(Pmps). Like C. pneumoniae of human origin [25,26],
koala LPCoLN is predicted to encode 21 Pmps that are
phylogenetically related to one of six basic subtypes
(pmpA, B/C, D, E/F, G/I and H; Additional files 3 and
4) [25,27-29]. The organisation of the pmp loci of koala
LPCoLN is conserved relative to the C. pneumoniae
human isolates. However, where the four human isolates
carry several interrupted pmp genes (Additional file 3),
koala LPCoLN carries uninterrupted, full-length versions
of the same genes, including pmpG3, pmpG4 and
pmpE3 (Additional file 3). A global comparison of all
pmp sequences reveals a total of 2015 SNPs (of which
994 generated an amino acid change; see Additional file
5 for approximate SNP positions) differentiating koala
LPCoLN from the four C. pneumoniae human isolates,
with the highest percentage of SNPs observed in pmpE4
(30.46%) and pmpE3 (6.95%). In addition to SNPs, several strain-specific (human versus animal) indels (insertions and deletions) were evident in pmpB, pmpE1,
pmpG2, pmpG4, pmpG5, pmpG7, pmpG10, and
pmpG13 (Additional file 3). Interestingly, the pmpG5
pseudogene is interrupted by a stop codon in all five
strains albeit at different sites: LPCoLN carries a seven
nt indel (GAT GTA C) at nt position 332, resulting in a
TAA stop codon at nt position 346, while the four
human isolates have a SNP (C to T) at nt 1483, resulting in a TAA stop codon (data not shown). Previous
analyses of human isolates have revealed variable numbers of 393 nt tandem repeat segments in pmpG6,
including two repeats in AR39 [25] and J138 [30], and
three repeats in TW183 (Geng MM, Schuhmacher A,
Muehldorfer I, Bensch KW, Schaefer KP, Schneider S,
Pohl T, Essig A, Marre R, Melchers K: The genome
sequence of Chlamydia pneumoniae TW183 and comparison with other Chlamydia strains based on whole
genome sequence analysis, submitted) and CWL029
[26]. The LPCoLN genome carries three variable tandem
repeats in pmpG6.

Type III secretion (T3S) occurs independently of the
sec pathway and requires assembly of a secretion apparatus composed of approximately 20 proteins. However,
in this analysis we looked at more than just the apparatus proteins; we also examined potential secreted proteins and chaperone proteins involved in T3S.
Additional file 6 compares 26 proteins from LPCoLN to
putative orthologs of other chlamydial species. Ten
apparatus-encoding genes (CDSs CPK_ORF00106, 111,
115, 231, 232, 233, 234, 236, 830 and 831), which were
either annotated as such and/or found to be homologous to previously studied proteins in other chlamydial
spp. were examined. Genetic comparisons indicate ≥
98.2% nucleotide sequence identity between each koala
LPCoLN T3S apparatus gene and orthologs from the
human isolates. Similarly, comparisons of genes which
were annotated as, or are similar to, chaperone-encoding
genes that assist in the folding of effectors demonstrated
high conservation with ≥ 99.3% sequence identity to the
equivalent genes in the C. pneumoniae isolates from
humans.
Nine putative effector-encoding genes (CDSs
CPK_ORF00107, 216, 217, 430, 445, 446, 799, 800 and
832) of C. pneumoniae koala LPCoLN were compared
to their counterparts in the human isolates. As with the
T3S apparatus proteins, all koala LPCoLN effectors
exhibited ≥ 98.2% sequence identity with their human
isolate counterparts (Additional file 6).
The plasticity zone or replication termination region is
a hypervariable region that is linked to genetic differences in chlamydial pathogen-host relationships. The
membrane attack complex/perforin (MACPF) of the
plasticity zone is one such protein that showed varied
degrees of polymorphism among the chlamydial species.
There was a significant length polymorphism differentiating the MACPF of C. pneumoniae koala (2457 nt
CPK_ORF00685) from all four human isolates which
encode a predicted defective MACPF separately incorporated into two ORFs, CP_0594 (381 nt) and CP_0593

Page 3 of 10

(1236 nt) (Figure 1). A comparison with other chlamydial species showed that a C. pneumoniae ancestor separated from other ‘Chlamydophila spp.’ before the large
indel was removed from the human isolates. Similar to
the C. pneumoniae koala LPCoLN MACPF, C. trachomatis serovar, A/HAR, B/Jali20/OT, D/UQ-3/CX, L2b/
UCH-1/proctititis, L2/434/Bu and C. muridarum Nigg
isolates had a full-length version (Additional file 7),
while variations of the MACPF were observed in
C. abortus S26/3, C. caviae GPIC and C. felis Fe/C-56
isolates (Additional file 7), which showed frame disruptions (likely pseudogenes). Protochlamydia amoebophila
UWE25 did not have any detectable MACPF orthologs.
MotifScans of the chlamydial MACPF (with the exception of C. caviae, C. abortus and C. felis) revealed an
MIR (Mannosyltransferase, Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate
receptor and Ryanodine receptor) motif, suggestive of a
possible ligand transferase function. The size variation
of the C. pneumoniae MACPF may serve as a useful
marker in future genetic investigation. For example, the
MACPF gene sequence may potentially differentiate
C. pneumoniae animal isolates from C. pneumoniae
human isolates.
Genes involved in nucleotide salvaging pathways or
amino acid biosynthesis

All sequenced chlamydial genomes to date encode a
CTP synthetase, the enzyme that converts UTP to CTP,
and an ATP/ADP translocase [25,31]. However, comparative genomic analysis suggests that multiple modifications have occurred in nucleotide salvage pathways
during the course of chlamydial evolution, as revealed
by the variable presence of udk (uridine kinase), pyrE
(pyrimidine phosphoribosyl transferase), guaB (IMP
dehydrogenase), guaA (GMP synthase) and add (adenosine deaminase) in different isolates (Table 1).
C. pneumoniae is the only chlamydial species to have
a udk gene for UMP production. Our examination of
the C. pneumoniae sequence revealed that the 3’ end of

the gene was unique to the species. No significant
sequence similarity was observed in other organisms
between nt regions 541-669, indicating that this region
might be specific for C. pneumoniae. A sequence alignment of the full-length udk gene identified only three
SNPs (one amino acid change) differentiating koala
LPCoLN from the sequenced human isolates.
The bacterial pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway
includes several enzymes for the conversion of UMP
into CTP. However, all chlamydial genomes thus far
lack the genes for most of the pathway with the exception of the last few steps (Additional file 8). C. pneumoniae of koala and human origins, C. felis, C. caviae and
C. abortus have the pyrE gene, encoding an orotate
phosphoribosyl transferase involved in pyrimidine biosynthesis. However, the final step in de novo pyrimidine
biosynthesis is via orotidine-5’-monophosphate decarboxylase (pyrF) and this gene is missing from all chlamydial genomes.
The purine biosynthesis pathway is also incomplete,
similar to the pyrimidine pathway, with many genes
variably missing in the chlamydial genomes (Table 1).
The only four genes that are absent from the koala
LPCoLN genome but are present in the human genomes
include CP_0597, which encodes a hypothetical protein,
guaB (IMP dehydrogenase), guaA (GMP synthase) and
add (AMP adenosine deaminase), which are involved in
purine ribonucleotide biosynthesis. The guaA and add
sequences of the C. pneumoniae human isolates were
identical, while guaB fragmentation was evident in
TW183, CWL029 and J138 isolates with a deleted

324 nt at the 5’ end of the sequence (Figure 1). The
CP_0597 gene resides next to this guaBA-add cluster
(Figure 1), which may indicate that this gene may also
be involved in purine biosynthesis.
The tryptophan biosynthesis operon is missing from
several chlamydial species including C. muridarum
Nigg, C. abortus S26/3, and C. pneumoniae of both
koala and human origin (Table 1). Despite this absence,
C. pneumoniae koala and human encode a functional
aromatic amino acid (tryptophan) hydroxylase, although
the koala LPCoLN isolate is missing the extended
N-terminal region [32]. While variations in C. pneumoniae tyrP (tryptophan tyrosine permease) copy numbers
have been found between human isolates [33], we report
that koala LPCoLN, a respiratory isolate, has a single
copy of tyrP. A comparison of the tyrP sequence from
all five sequenced (full-genome) C. pneumoniae isolates
revealed that the sequence was highly conserved across
the seven copies of tyrP, revealing only nine SNPs
including seven unique to koala LPCoLN, four of which
led to an amino acid change. Previously, Gieffers et al.
[33] published a tyrP-specific SNP profile of 20 C. pneumoniae human isolates, and here we report the SNP
profile of two additional respiratory isolates J138
(CGGGG) and LPCoLN (CAAGG).

C. pneumoniae koala LPCoLN [24], pCpnE1 from
C. pneumoniae horse N16 [34], pCpA1 from C. psittaci

felis feline Fe/C-56 [35], pCpGP1 from C. caviae guinea
pig GPIC [36], pMoPn from C. muridarum mouse Nigg
[25], and pCTA, pJALI, pSW2 and pLVG440 from C.
trachomatis human serovars A [37], B [38], E [38] and
L1 [39], respectively, were compared for their overall
synteny and relationship (Additional file 9). These plasmids each contain eight major open reading frames
(ORFs – potentially encode a protein) designated ORF18. Although the plasmid sequences vary in size (71697966 bp), alignment of their amino acid sequences
revealed a high degree of similarity and large conserved
regions (Additional files 9). The pCpnKo and pCpnE1
plasmid sequences share 96.2% identity and are more
closely related to pCpA1 (81.3 and 78.9% identity),
pCpGP1 (81.6 and 79.1% identity) and pCfe1 (77.5 and
75.1% identity) than with pMoPn (69.5 and 67.7% identity), pCTA, pJALI, pSW2 and pLVG440 (63.9-69.5%
identity) (Additional file 10). Overall, there were
approximately 30 indels among the species; three of the
longest indels were identified in ORF1 of pCpnE1
(deletion), pCfe1 (insertion) and pSW2 (deletion). A
phylogenetic tree was inferred from multiple sequence
alignment of the amino acid sequence (Figure 2). Three
main branches (supported with a high bootstrap value)
were evident: (1) C. pneumoniae LPCoLN and N16; (2)
C. psittaci N352, C. felis Fe/C-56 and C. caviae GPIC;
(3) C. muridarum and C. trachomatis isolates.
The bacteriophage is another strain-specific extrachromosomal element reported in chlamydial species. In
C. pneumoniae, AR39 is the only human genome to
have an extrachromosomal bacteriophage (4524 nt single-stranded DNA) [25], whereas the koala LPCoLN
genome showed remnants of a phage. The first remnant
of a phage in the koala LPCoLN genome was evident in

Page 5 of 10

CPK_ORF00729, a 366 nt incomplete ORF that is presumably defective, sharing approximately 79% similarity
(nt 301/382) to the partial-length of the human AR39
phage. CPK_ORF00729 also shares 97% similarity (nt
324/333) to the Chp1 remnant (C. psittaci phage),
which is present in the four C. pneumoniae human genomes. This suggests earlier integration of the phage genome in the C. pneumoniae genome (Geng MM,
Schuhmacher A, Muehldorfer I, Bensch KW, Schaefer
KP, Schneider S, Pohl T, Essig A, Marre R, Melchers K:
The genome sequence of Chlamydia pneumoniae
TW183 and comparison with other Chlamydia strains
based on whole genome sequence analysis, submitted).
The second koala LPCoLN phage remnant was a 445 nt
ORF, termed CPK_ORF00730, which appears to be
‘intact’, sharing approximately 77% similarity (nt 342/
445) to the human AR39 phage. The koala LPCoLN
phage remnants are positioned between hypothetical
genes in the genome and there appear to be no further
remnants of the phage within this region of the genome.
A comparison of the C. pneumoniae koala LPCoLN
phage with other chlamydial species revealed approximately 77-79% sequence identity to partial-length
sequences of the C. psittaci Chp2 phage, C. pecorum
phage 3, C. caviae phiCPG1 phage and C. abortus Chp4
phage.

Discussion
In this work, we applied computational analyses to
explore the genome content and genetic diversity
among the recently sequenced C. pneumoniae koala
LPCoLN genome and previously published C. pneumoniae human genomes (AR39, CWL029, J138 and
TW183). The koala LPCoLN genome is larger than all
four C. pneumoniae human genomes by 10-12 kbp. We
combined BLAST search methods and motif analysis for
use in elucidating the relationship between gene

function and evolution. Even though these techniques
have several limitations [40], our comparative approach
has (i) identified genome plasticity, (ii) provided circumstantial evidence for the presumed direction of C. pneumoniae evolution, and (iii) suggested targets for
detection and differentiation of C. pneumoniae isolates
from both human and animal origins.
The presence of unique insertions/deletions is evidence of evolution in action. For the majority of these
genes, the C. pneumoniae koala genome has the fulllength version. These length polymorphisms suggest
that the presumed functional changes are brought about
by adaptation to a specialised niche, where the ancestral
gene function may no longer be required. Therefore, it
is important to understand how these genetic differences
may influence differences in pathogenicity and fitness in
the host. Our data supports the findings of Rattei et al.
[41] and the whole genome findings of Myers et al. [24]
in that the essentially clonal human isolates have
evolved from an animal strain(s) that has adapted to
humans through fragmentation, decay and loss-of-function processes whereby the activity of the gene product
may be reduced or specialised. Hence, the koala
LPCoLN genome seems to be an ‘older’ strain in this
sense. In addition, we provide new information on strain
diversity and have identified targets for detection and
further investigation.
Our analysis revealed a total of 140 genes that were
specific to C. pneumoniae. One hundred and twentythree of these represented hypothetical genes with no
significant similarity to genes in other organisms present
in the database. Further analysis of these hypothetical
genes (subcellular localisation, gene expression analysis,
functional profiling from microarray analysis) may reveal
undiscovered biovars or subspecies in C. pneumoniae.
The Pmp family is characterised by an unusual degree
of sequence polymorphism, including mutations and
large indels across all species [42-47] and showed variation within C. penumoniae. This suggests that the pmp
gene family is subjected to high selective pressure
(niche, host-specific or immune-mediated), correlating
with a relatively faster evolutionary rate for these antigens. Taken together, the polymorphism of pmp
sequences in C. pneumoniae from humans and animals
is dually consistent with the divergent evolution of the
pmp genes under host-specific selection while maintaining the capacity to adapt to specific niches or immune
responses in the two different hosts.
In light of the variation seen between other families of
genes and their orthologs in the human isolates, namely
the pmp protein family, the strict conservation of T3S
effector genes was initially surprising given the effectors’
normal tendency for divergence. While the differences
observed between other regions of the genomes are

Page 6 of 10

consistent with evolutionary changes [24], the relative
conservation of effector genes over equivalent time suggest that changes in genes encoding effector proteins
were likely selected against. This is consistent with a key
role of T3S effectors in mediating steps of the biology of
C. pneumoniae that are conserved in human and animal
strains, such as inclusion and intracellular development.
Overall, these results support a critical role for T3S less
in the virulence than in the developmental biology of
these organisms. Such a role has been proposed in the
context of the contact-dependent T3S-mediated hypothesis of chlamydial development proposed earlier [48,49].
Orthologs of the MACPF were identified in several
chlamydial species. The first biological characterisation
of the C. trachomatis MACPF by Taylor et al. [50] has
revealed that the MACPF (CT153) might be activated
by proteolytic processing and may play a role in the
acquisition or modification of host-derived lipids. By
contrast, studies of the MACPF in other organisms,
including that of Toxoplasma spp. have shown that
ablation of the MACPF (termed TgPLP1) resulted in a
reduction in virulence (in mice), whereby TgPLP1 deficient parasites were unable to exit normally and were
entrapped within host cells, due to the inability to permeabilise the parasitophorous vacuole membrane [51].
If the chlamydial MACPF was to play a similar role in
egression or virulence, then why have several species
failed to retain this gene? Non-lytic family members
have also been identified in other organisms including
Astrotactin involved in neural migration in mammals
[52], a Drosophila torso-like protein involved in
embryonic development [53] and Plu-MACPF of
Photorhabdus luminescens which binds to the surface
of insect cells [54]. Further investigation of this gene
should provide more insight into its role in
Chlamydiaceae.
C. pneumoniae is the only chlamydial species thus far
to have a udk gene encoding uridine kinase. The udk
gene is a pyrimidine ribonucleoside kinase that phosphorylates uridine and cytidine into uridine or cytidine
monophosphate (UMP/CMP) [55], and is highly conserved in the species. It has been reported that the Prevotella bryantii genome encodes a putative uracil DNA
glycosylase and uridine kinase, likely to be involved in
the removal of misincorporated uracil from DNA and
its subsequent re-use [56]. All chlamydial genomes also
encode a uracil DNA glycosylase, however, C. pneumoniae is the only species carrying the udk ortholog. This
implies that an alternative gene product is involved in
UMP production in the other chlamydial species. The
C. muridarum genome includes a CDS (upp) encoding a
uracil phosphoribosyltransferase [25] that may represent
the main pathway for UMP production in this species.
C. pneumoniae is unusual in having a very broad host

Mitchell et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:442
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/442

range and therefore the fact that it is the only chlamydial species to have retained the udk gene could reflect
this broad host capacity.
Most bacteria can salvage or synthesise their own
purines and pyrimidines. By contrast, chlamydiae and
rickettsiae (another obligate intracellular bacterium)
are incapable of de novo synthesis, and to a degree, of
salvage [31,57]. Given the absence of genes for
enzymes upstream in the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway, it is unclear why the pyrE should be retained.
The final step in the pathway is via pyrF which is
absent from the chlamydial genome, suggesting that
they are unable to convert orotate to UMP. The presence in all chlamydial genomes of orthologs encoding
the three downstream enzymes involved in UMP to
CTP conversion and the earlier demonstration of CTP
synthetase activity in these organisms [58,59] confirm
that chlamydiae are not auxotrophic for CTP. Furthermore, a three-gene cluster including guaB, guaA and
add have been selectively maintained in several chlamydial species including C. pneumoniae AR39,
CWL029, TW183 and J138, C. felis Fe/C-56, C. caviae
GPIC and C. muridarum Nigg. C. abortus has a guaB
pseudogene, whereas the C. pneumoniae LPCoLN and
C. trachomatis serovar A/HAR, B/Jali20/OT, D/UQ-3/
CX, L2b/UCH-1/proctititis, L2/434/Bu and Candidatus
Protochlamydia amoebophila UWE25 genomes lack all
three genes [25,26,30,35,36,60]. The selective loss of
guaBA-add from C. pneumoniae koala LPCoLN and
other chlamydial species suggest that these three
enzymes required for inter-conversion of GMP, IMP
and AMP must be acquired by other means or are
clearly not essential for species survival.
Copy number variations of the tyrP (tryptophan tyrosine permease) gene have been suggested to reflect vascular tropism and pathogenicity among C. pneumoniae
human isolates with multiple copies associated with
respiratory infection and single copy more frequently
associated with vascular tropism [33]. A comparison of
the five sequenced C. pneumoniae genomes also
revealed variations in the tyrP (tryptophan tyrosine permease) copy number that are, however, inconsistent
with the hypothesis by Gieffers et al. [33]. Among these,
two respiratory isolates (koala LPCoLN and human
J138) [24,30], as well as the single conjunctival isolate
(TW183) of the group (Geng MM, Schuhmacher A,
Muehldorfer I, Bensch KW, Schaefer KP, Schneider S,
Pohl T, Essig A, Marre R, Melchers K: The genome
sequence of Chlamydia pneumoniae TW183 and comparison with other Chlamydia strains based on whole
genome sequence analysis, submitted) have a single tyrP
copy while two other respiratory isolates (CWL029 and
AR39) [25,26] carry duplicate copies of tyrP.

The loss and fragmentation of pre-existing genes during evolution is one of the primary distinguishing features between C. pneumoniae koala and C. pneumoniae
human. Extrachromosomal plasmids have been identified in six of the nine chlamydial species. As the plasmid
is not common to C. pneumoniae, it is not known why
koala LPCoLN has a plasmid.
While proteins with predicted or known biologic function are favoured candidate gene targets, many C. pneumoniae-specific hypothetical proteins with no predicted
function were identified in the comparisons and may be
worth further investigating for their potential role in
host tropism, pathogenicity and niche adaptation (see
Additional file 2 for the list of genes). A suggested list
of target genes for C. pneumoniae detection and a brief
description of their characteristics is summarised in
additional file 11. Selected genes include (i) C. pneumoniae-specific genes for detection of C. pneumoniae, (ii)
genes that could potentially differentiate isolates from
human and animal origins, for example, length polymorphic genes including the membrane attack complex
perforin and the hypothetical protein CPK_ORF00679,
(iii) genes for the identification of a C. pneumoniae
plasmid.

Conclusions
The study of whole genome sequences provides important clues to the natural history of C. pneumoniae and
their hosts, and assists in the identification of functional
differences that may determine pathogenicity and virulence differences between the strains. Previously, whole
genome comparisons have focused on four practically
clonal C. pneumoniae human genomes, which make the
identification of target genes for strain differentiation
quite challenging. In this study we have made use of the
recently sequenced koala LPCoLN genome, which is the
largest and most unique C. pneumoniae genome
sequenced thus far, in order to select target genes that
represented traits of strain-specific determinants.
Further investigation of these genes in other host species
may provide additional clues as to what enables this
pathogen to: (i) present varied clinical pathologies, (ii)
occupy multiple niches, and (iii) establish an infection in
cold and warm-blooded hosts. Moreover, these genes
may become targets for improved diagnosis and therapeutic strategies.
Methods
Chlamydia pneumoniae isolates

The complete genomic sequences of C. pneumoniae
AR39 (GenBank accession number AE002161), CWL029
(GenBank accession number AE001363) TW183 (GenBank accession number AE009440), J138 (GenBank

accession number BA000008) and LPCoLN (GenBank
accession CP001713) were used in this study.
Strategy for selection of genes used for comparisons

The selection strategy involved individual gene-by-gene
comparisons of the complete koala LPCoLN genome.
NCBI BLAST [61] searches using tblastx and tblastn
were conducted in order to search for orthologs in the
C. pneumoniae human genome and other organisms
using an E-value cutoff of 1 × 10-4 with manual curation. This approach enabled us to identify regions of
high SNP accumulation and to select target genes for
comparison. These selected genes were grouped into
five categories by their putative, predicted or hypothetical functions. The categories included: (1) C. pneumoniae-specific genes (with respect to the koala
LPCoLN genome, n = 140); (2) genes with a prior
demonstrated role in chlamydial biology and pathogenicity (n = 49); (3) genes encoding nucleotide salvage
or amino acid biosynthesis proteins (n = 6); (4) extrachromosomal elements, including a plasmid (n = 9)
and bacteriophage-related genes (n = 2) (Additional
files 1 and 2). Selected genes were individually aligned
in order to identify SNPs, indels and targets for strainspecific adaptations.
Analysis of nucleotide and amino acid sequences and
phylogeny

Gene alignments were performed using the Clustal W
program (MacVector 10.6 Genetics Computer Group,
Madison, Wisconcin) to identify polymorphisms and
indels (insertions/deletions) [62]. Conserved residues are
outlined, similar amino acids are shaded in grey, mismatches are not shaded and dashes correspond to gaps
in the sequence. A consensus line appears at the bottom
of the alignment. Pmp sequences were subjected to multiple sequence alignment using ClustalW2 (EMBL-EBI)
[63] and BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor [64]. SNP
position analysis for each group was performed using
the Microsoft Excel program (Microsoft Corporation).
Motif Scan [65] was used to identify motifs in a
sequence.
A phylogenetic tree was constructed by NeighborJoining, tie breaking = systematic, distance corrected by
the Poisson method with gaps distributed proportionally
and 1,000 bootstrap replicates.

C. pneumoniae (Cpn), C. abortus (Cab), C. caviae (Cav) and C. felis (Cfe)
contain a pyrE gene encoding an orotate phosphoribosyltransferase,
while C. muridarum (Cmu) and C. trachomatis (Ctr) lack this gene. The
next step in the pathway is via pyrF, which is absent from all chlamydial
genomes. Interestingly, all six genomes have maintained the last three

some degree of ancestry among them. The C. pneumoniae plasmid
shared a close relationship with C. psittaci, C. caviae and C. felis, while
C. muridarum and C. trachomatis were highly conserved. Predicted
functions include plasmid replication (ORF1 and ORF2), double-stranded
DNA unwinding (ORF3), chlamydial pathogenesis (ORF5) and regulation
of partitioning and copy number (ORF7 and ORF8) [34,67]. The functions
of ORF4 and ORF6 remain to be determined.
