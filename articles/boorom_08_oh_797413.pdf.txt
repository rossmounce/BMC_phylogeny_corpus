Abstract
Blastocystis is a prevalent enteric protozoan that infects a variety of vertebrates. Infection with
Blastocystis in humans has been associated with abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, fatigue, skin
rash, and other symptoms. Researchers using different methods and examining different patient
groups have reported asymptomatic infection, acute symptomatic infection, and chronic
symptomatic infection. The variation in accounts has lead to disagreements concerning the role of
Blastocystis in human disease, and the importance of treating it. A better understanding of the
number of species of Blastocystis that can infect humans, along with realization of the limitations of
the existing clinical laboratory diagnostic techniques may account for much of the disagreement.
The possibility that disagreement was caused by the emergence of particular pathogenic variants of
Blastocystis is discussed, along with the potential role of Blastocystis infection in irritable bowel
syndrome (IBS). Findings are discussed concerning the role of protease-activated receptor-2 in
enteric disease which may account for the presence of abdominal pain and diffuse symptoms in
Blastocystis infection, even in the absence of fever and endoscopic findings. The availability of better
diagnostic techniques and treatments for Blastocystis infection may be of value in understanding
chronic gastrointestinal illness of unknown etiology.

Review
Introduction
Blastocystis is a prevalent enteric protist that infects a variety of vertebrates. Researchers have described asymptomatic and symptomatic infection in humans. Infection
with Blastocystis is termed blastocystosis and has been
associated with abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation,
fatigue[1], skin rash [2-4], and other symptoms. Although
Blastocystis is commonly referred to as a protozoal parasite, small subunit (SSU) rRNA analysis has placed Blastocystis in the phylum Stramenopile, along with other
organisms such as diatoms, brown algae, slime nets, and
water moulds [2]. Blastocystis is non-motile, and is the
only Stramenopile known to commonly cause infection
in humans [2].

One of the earliest reports of symptomatic blastocystosis
occurred in 1899 and was followed by sporadic reports
through the 20th century, that accelerated in 1984 [3]. In
the United States, a 1987 survey by the Center for Disease
Control showed the frequency of occurrence of Blastocystis
in US clinical lab samples to be a relatively low 2.6% [4].
A study published by two physicians in California in 1988
reported symptoms of blastocystosis could usually be
attributed to another cause and suggested that Blastocystis
was non-pathogenic [5]. However, this finding was not in
agreement with the experience of US researchers treating
patients with international travel history [6,7] or with
many researchers outside the United States [1,8].
A debate followed in 1990 between the Californian physicians and others in which some noted a lack of historical
study identifying Blastocystis as pathogenic, and suggested
that resolution of symptoms in patients following antiprotozoal therapy was due to the treatment of an undetected pathogen [9]. Objections notwithstanding, the clinical
community has diagnosed and treated the infection frequently since then [6,10-12], although the research community
describes
Blastocystis
pathogenicity
as
controversial [13]. Blastocystis is now by far the most prevalent mono-infection in symptomatic patients in the
United States [14] and was found 28.5 times more often
than Giardia lamblia as a mono-infection in symptomatic
patients in a 2000 study [14]. Informal communications
suggest the controversy surrounding this protozoan has
made it an unpopular research topic in some countries
(unpublished data, Kenneth Boorom).
The problem of irritable bowel syndrome
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a highly prevalent gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain
with diarrhea and/or constipation. The etiology of IBS has
not been definitively established. IBS was originally
thought to be a psychosomatic disorder [15], but more
recent studies have identified chronic immune activation

http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/1/1/40

in IBS patients [16]. The annual direct and indirect costs
of IBS in the United States may be as high as $30 billion
[17], making it one of the most expensive gastrointestinal
diseases in the US and other developed countries. Unlike
viral and bacterial gastroenteritis, symptoms of IBS may
last indefinitely [18]. The chronic nature of the disease
may limit ordinary activities (Figure 1[19]). The disease
raises health costs by 49% and much of the additional
cost is due to extra-intestinal co-morbidities [20]. The
prevalence of IBS in some developing countries is in the
35–43% range [21,22].
In medical practice, a functional disorder can be described
as "a set of symptoms not explained by structural or biochemical abnormalities" [23]. IBS is the only functional
bowel disorder where a protozoal infection has been
found in almost half of diagnosed cases using simple
methods such as culture and staining (Figure 2[24-27]).
The relative prevalence of symptoms of abdominal pain,
diarrhea, and constipation in Blastocystis infection and IBS
show a remarkable similarity (Figure 3[28,29]). High Blastocystis infection rates seem to accompany a high prevalence of IBS (Figure 4[30-35]). Researchers from Pakistan
and other countries have suggested that IBS may be caused
by Blastocystis [36,37]. However, the indeterminacy of
Blastocystis' pathogenicity may have made it difficult to
address this infection with a systematic approach used in
other infectious diseases. The use of modern tools for
identification and classification of Blastocystis isolates
from humans, along with a better understanding of the
pathogenesis of enteric protozoal infections may explain
conflicting reports from researchers.
Phylogeny
Following the discovery of Blastocystis in humans, it was
assumed that humans carried a unique species of Blastocystis, which was given the name Blastocystis hominis [38].
Animals and birds were thought to carry different species,
which were subsequently assigned names such as Blastocystis ratti for isolates from rats [39] and Blastocystis galli for
isolates from chickens [40]. Phylogenetic analysis of SSU
rRNA gene sequences of Blastocystis isolates from humans
and animals has shown no evidence of a species of Blastocystis unique to humans [12]. Rather, humans acquire
infection with the same species of Blastocystis acquired by
rats, dogs, horses, cows, pigs, birds and other animals
[12]. All nine of the subtypes of Blastocystis found in mammals and birds are found in humans as well. As a reflection of the low host specificity of Blastocystis, a
classification system has been developed in which isolates
are identified by subtype numbers rather than host names
[41]. The nomenclature proposed describes such isolates
as Blastocystis sp. subtype n where n is a number from 1 to
9. The genetic diversity that exists within the isolates previously identified as Blastocystis hominis is similar to the

diversity that exists within the entire Cryptosporidium
genus (Unpublished data, Dr. Eric Viscogliosi). The
genomes of the mitochondrion-like organelle (MLO) of
Blastocystis sp. subtypes 4 and 1 have been sequenced. The
divergence seen between the MLO genomes of these two
subtypes was greater than that seen between the MLO
genomes of many congeneric species and even the MLO
genomes from some species of differing genera [42].
Blastocystis sp. subtypes 3 and 1 make up most chronic
infections in humans [43-45] (Table 1 and Figure 5[46]).
These types are carried by cows, pigs, chickens, and horses
[12]. Blastocystis sp. subtypes 3 and 1 are also associated
with most symptomatic mono-infections [44,47-49].
Researchers have identified Blastocystis sp. subtype 2 infection as frequently asymptomatic [50] or occurring primarily as a co-infection in symptomatic patients [44] or
carried primarily by older adults [51]. Expression of symptoms does not equate with ease of detection – Blastocystis
sp. subtype 2 is the most readily detected [44] while Blastocystis sp. subtype 3 is difficult to detect [52] and may
remain undetected in symptomatic patients despite extensive laboratory testing [49].
Subtypes 4, 6, and 7 appear to show some degree of host
specificity, in that their only established non-human hosts
are rodents (subtype 4) and birds (subtypes 6 and 7) [12].
This host specificity may be responsible for the low prev-

alence of these subtypes in studies of the human population [53], although they appear more frequently in
clinical laboratory studies where samples are collected
from symptomatic patients [48,52], suggesting the possibility that these may be associated with acute infection in
humans. However, the number of studies performed to
date is small, and additional research is needed to understand potential differences in the course of infection associated with various subtypes.
Some isolates from the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC) have been genotyped, and belong to subtype 1
(ATCC 50177, 50609, 50610, 50751, 50752), subtype 3
(ATCC 50587, 50629, 50754), subtype 4 (ATCC 50608,
50753) while ATCC 50588 and 50613 are mixed [54]. The
ATCC's records show that the most recently accessioned
strain of Blastocystis was acquired in 1995 [55].
Symptoms
A 1989 Saudi study of over 200 symptomatic patients
described symptoms of abdominal pain, constipation,
diarrhea, nausea, and anorexia [1]. The study also noted a
number of extra-intestinal symptoms, such as headaches,
depression, and fatigue. The inclusion of these as symptoms was criticized in the 1980's [9], but subsequently
found to be co-morbidities in IBS [56]. A 1991 study from
a researcher at the US National Institutes of Health

described the unusual clinical presentation of blastocystosis [3]:
"The most usual complaint of blastocystosis patients is of
intense abdominal discomfort accompanied by pain.
Diarrhea is not standard, and constipation is common. The
symptoms gleaned from the literature include abdominal
pain, discomfort, anorexia, bloating, cramps, diarrhea,
constipation, alternating diarrhea and constipation, watery
diarrhea, mucus diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, sleeplessness, nausea, weight loss, inability to work, lassitude, dizziness, flatus, pruritis, and tenesmus. Blood in the stool as
well as excessive mucus and leukocytes have been reported."
In a study from Jordan, the most common symptoms
reported in preschool children were abdominal pain,

recurrent diarrhea, cramps, anorexia, and fatigue [57]. In
older school children, additional symptoms were seen,
such as mild diarrhea, nausea, bloating, and alternating
diarrhea and constipation [58]. A 1989 study of 16,545
specimens from a clinical laboratory in Vancouver, Canada found Blastocystis as a mono-infection in 342 patients
[10]. In this study, the symptoms found in 143 patients
whose physicians responded to a survey were diarrhea,
pain, nausea, gas, malaise, fever, weight loss, and chills. A
frequency of bowel movements ranging from 1 to 25 per
day was noted. Of the 69 patients responding to a detailed
survey, 8 reported bloody diarrhea [10]. In a smaller study
of patients in Oregon with chronic gastrointestinal illness
and findings of infection with Blastocystis sp. subtype 3,
intermittent bloody diarrhea was reported by one patient
as well [49].

Diagnostic techniques
Diagnosis of Blastocystis infection involves the detection of
the organism, and a determination as to whether its presence is responsible for symptoms. Methods which have
been used clinically and in research studies for this purpose are described below.
Detection of the organism in stool specimens
Most clinical methods endeavor to identify infection by
finding the organism in stool specimens. Variations on
this method may involve concentration, staining, culturing, and extraction of DNA followed by polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) testing. Most methods have been found to
have low sensitivity [69] (Table 2).

subtypes are associated with various non-human hosts
[12,74].

Testimony to the Oregon State Legislature by physiciandiagnosed patients with blastocystosis included descriptions of severe fatigue, with one patient noting the inability to walk more than 15 minutes [59]. Symptoms
reported in a collection of reports from patients in the
United States included those from a returnee from Nepal
were described as "constipation, spasms in ascending
colon area, large loss of weight, occasional loose stools,
fatigue, mental fogginess, increase in symptoms after eating, the need to eat every few hours, fast heartbeat, pale
skin and others [60]." Upper gastrointestinal symptoms,
such as dyspepsia, are also seen in Blastocystis infection,
particularly in females according to one study [51]. Food
intolerance was noted in the original Saudi study [1].
Patients with blastocystosis may develop elaborate exclusion diets to control symptoms (unpublished data, Ken
Boorom).
Dermatological involvement
Reports of skin rash began appearing in the literature in
1993 [61], with additional reports in the following years
[62-65]. Recent clinical studies have reported the association of skin rash with Blastocystis infection [51,66]. A
Greek case report of one patient with Blastocystis associated rash identified the genotype infecting the patient as
Blastocystis sp subtype 3 [67]. Dermatologists have found
Blastocystis infection at a statistically significant rate in
patients with allergic skin conditions [68]. Figure 6 show
such a rash.

Blastocystis is one of numerous human protozoan and
metazoan intestinal parasites sought for in stools in clinical microbiology laboratories. Therefore, generic, physicochemical methods such as the formol ethyl acetate concentration technique (FECT) will not necessarily maximize recoveries of all intestinal parasites because of their
differing specific gravities and sensitivities to formalin.
Both parasite morphology and morphometry may vary.
Some isolates are only 6–8 μm in size [70] which makes
microscopical detection difficult, especially when parasites are present in small numbers. Vegetative stages can
be mistaken for fat globules, leukocytes, or other artifacts
in the stool (Figure 7). The quantity of Blastocystis shed has
been found to vary significantly between patients, and
over time from the same experimental animal [71]. Infection with Blastocystis sp. subtype 3 is less readily detected
than infection with Blastocystis sp. subtype 2 using FECT
[44]. As Blastocystis sp. subtype 2 is less likely to be associated with symptomatic mono-infection [44,50], this effect
may be responsible for producing conflicting results
between researchers.
To improve detection rates, one study reported the use of
a "purged sample" [6], which involves the use of a laxative. Stool culture has been suggested as an additional
method, which may offer the best tradeoff between sensitivity and cost and may be less costly than methods currently in use [44]. Xenic cultures of Blastocystis can be
produced from stool samples with inexpensive materials,
and without the use of an anaerobic chamber [72]. The
absolute sensitivity of stool culture as a diagnostic
method is unknown. Stool culture may be positive in only
50–70% of infections with Entamoeba histolytica [73]. PCR
testing of DNA extracted directly from stool specimens is
considered to be the most sensitive method for the detection of Blastocystis, and represents a 10% improvement
over culture [52]. It is currently the only way to differentiate subtypes of Blastocystis, and is used in research studies
where genotyping is necessary [74-76]. A real time PCR
test has been developed [54].

ble microscopically (unpublished data, Dr. Gregory
Spanakos). Stool specimens have been found to convert
to PCR negative after a few months of cold storage at -20C
(personal communications, Dr. Morris S. Jones and Dr.
Saovanee Leelayoova). Cryopreservation of extracted
DNA may offer an alternative.

Figure 6

Rash fromacquired domestically diagnosed with chronic blastRash from 39-year old US male diagnosed with
chronic blastocystosis acquired domestically60[60].
Skin rash in Blastocystis infection has been described as recurrent [65] and intensely pruritic [67]. Diagnosis of blastocystosis was by exclusion: eleven ova and parasite exams
(trichrome staining) performed at clinical laboratories from
2003–2006 were negative except for findings of Blastocystis.
Colonoscopy, endoscopy, and gluten challenge test were
negative. The infection was unresponsive to metronidazole,
nitazoxanide, and TMP/SMX. The isolate was genotyped as
Blastocystis sp. subtype 3 in a 2007 study [49].

PCR testing of DNA extracted directly from stool specimens is a valuable tool for genotyping Blastocystis in specimens [74-76]. However, complexities associated with
this method should be noted to guard against overconfidence in this as a diagnostic tool. Stool specimens contain
PCR inhibitors which can interfere with the detection
process. The high concentration of nucleases in some protozoa can interfere with detection [77]. Blastocystis' ability
to undergo programmed cell death with associated DNA
fragmentation [78] may also complicate PCR testing.
Finding suitable loci in order to detect and differentiate
isolates is a challenge because the entire genome of Blastocystis has not been sequenced and substantial genetic heterogeneity exists among the nine subtypes displayed
within the genus. Stool samples have been observed to
convert to PCR negative after remaining at room temperature for several hours, although the organism is still visi-

Significance of detection of the organism in stool
specimens
In addition to detection of Blastocystis, there is a need to
determine if it is the cause of illness in patients. Some
early reports suggested that Blastocystis might be diagnosed as a cause of illness only when present in large
numbers in stool samples. Blastocystis is now the only protozoan whose presence is reported along with its quantity
by US pathologists, with standardized terms such as "rare,
few, moderate, and many" describing its abundance [79].
However, several studies have found no correlation
between the quantity of Blastocystis in stool samples and
symptoms [10,51,80]. Researchers have found that tests
with low sensitivity failed to detect infection with the type
of Blastocystis most frequently found in symptomatic
patients [44]. Therefore, quantity of organisms identifiable in stool specimens may be a poor indicator of symptomatic status.

Genotyping of Blastocystis isolates may offer useful clinical
information, especially as more studies are accumulated
[44,47,51]. It may be possible to differentiate between
infections which are likely to be asymptomatic, acutely
symptomatic, and chronically symptomatic by subtyping
Blastocystis. Isolates that have been associated with symptomatic infection in humans have also been found in
asymptomatic carriers, so subtyping can not establish
Blastocystis as a cause of illness in a particular patient.
One study has reported the ability to distinguish between
symptomatic and asymptomatic infections by culturing
stool samples and identifying specific forms in culture
[81]. Because a limited number of isolates may have been
used in that study, additional work would be needed to
understand the applicability of this technique in other settings.
Detecting other factors in stool specimens
Some diagnostic tests seek to identify factors in stool specimens which would be uniquely associated with symptomatic infection. These may offer better sensitivity than
assays used to detect Blastocystis directly from stool.

One researcher reported success in the use of a fecal IgA
assay to discriminate between symptomatic and asymptomatic Blastocystis infections [82]. In that study, the
researcher reported that all patients with symptomatic
Blastocystis infection tested positive at a titer of 1:400,

Sensitivities are representative only, and based on a small number of studies. Actual sensitivities may vary between laboratories due to variation in
method, operator training, and quality of microscopic equipment [109], or variation in the distribution of Blastocystis subtypes being detected [44].

while all asymptomatic Blastocystis carriers and uninfected
patients tested negative at that titer.
As the pathogenesis of Blastocystis has been centered on
proteases [83], one approach may be to detect the protease rather than the Blastocystis, on the assumption that
Blastocystis may secrete higher levels of protease in symptomatic patients. Although it has not been applied with
the intention of detecting blastocystosis, researchers have
reported success in using a fecal serine protease assay in
the study of diarrhea predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-d) [84]. This study found that patients with
IBS-d exhibited significantly higher protease levels in
stool specimens, which were not found in patients diagnosed with diarrhea from acute infectious causes.

Detecting serum antibody response
Serum antibody tests using whole cell antigen have been
developed many times for research purposes, and generally show a correlation between serum antibody response
and symptomatic blastocystosis [36,82,85-87]. A 2007
study from China found that the serum antibody test was
almost as sensitive as stool culture [87]. Researchers have
found this test to be highly selective and sensitive for
symptomatic Blastocystis infection, although additional
trials are needed [85]. One study reported the ability to
differentiate between most symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers using an ELISA assay quantitatively [82]. A
1991 study noted an effort to make antisera available
commercially [3]. A United States company has reported
its investigation of this type of assay as a diagnostic product [88].

the low sensitivity of clinical diagnostic methods, along with the possibility that not all stages have been documented [52].

characterized by a central body (blue) that morphologically resembles a vacuole. The central body pushes the nuclei to the
periphery of the cell. The central body is a reservoir for proteases [83] and may serve other functions as well. Photos courtesy

Detecting infection through biopsies
In one study, colonic biopsies from IBS patients were
found to produce elevated levels of serine protease [89].
Since the biopsies, but not necessarily the stool samples,
seem to consistently contain the etiological element of
such gastrointestinal illness, these may provide a better
basis for the development of a "Gold Standard" for assays
that detect infectious elements associated with IBS.
How sensitive does an assay need to be?
Early studies suggested Blastocystis produced symptoms by
"overgrowing" in the gastrointestinal tract, which lead to
the practice of diagnosing blastocystosis only when the
organism was found in large quantities in stool samples.
A view more consistent with observed data suggests that
specific genotypes of Blastocystis [48] interact with host
factors, triggering an immune reaction [85] and producing proteases that produce symptoms [83]. As an extracellular enteric protozoan, Blastocystis is theoretically capable
of completing its life cycle without damaging host tissue,
so symptomatic infection may be considered to be a side
effect of infection. The mechanism that produces the
symptoms may differ from the mechanism by which Blastocystis reproduces and expresses itself in stool samples.

Blastocystis undergoes programmed cell death in response
to antibody exposure [90-93], so it is possible that patient
immune response may complicate recovery of Blastocystis
from stool specimens. One study found that the inability
to culture Blastocystis from patients was correlated with an
IgG3 response [36]. That study also found that the ability
to culture Blastocystis from symptomatic patients was
poorly correlated with positive results in immunological
testing [36]. The author attributed the effect to residual
immune response from treated Blastocystis. An alternate
possibility is that antibiotic treatment converts stool test
results from positive to negative, but leaves patients with
a residual infection.
Treatment
Modern treatment of Blastocystis has generally been with
metronidazole, with studies from the Middle East and US
reporting treatment success [1,6]. Co-trimoxazole (TMP/
SMX) has been used as well [94,95], as have nitazoxanide
[96] and rifaximin [97].

Resistance to metronidazole was reported as early as 1991
[3]. Researchers have reported frequent resistance [98100] and metronidazole may no longer be useful as a first
line treatment [100]. Metronidazole resistance varies geographically [98] and Appendix A summarizes some resistance studies (see additional file 1). One clinic has
reported success with a combination of secnidazole, nitazoxanide, and furazolidone [100]. All three drugs are not
available in many countries. A 2006 text described a US

http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/1/1/40

patient returning from Nepal with chronic blastocystosis
who was treated without success over a period of three
years with iodoquinol, paromomycin, doxycycline, albendazole, tinidazole, ornidazole, quinacrine, nitazoxanide,
rifaximin, furazolidone, co-trimoxazole, itraconazole,
ketoconazole, and various combinations of those drugs
[60]. A 1916 study described Blastocystis as an "infection
that is difficult to get rid of" and noted the use of emetine
[101].
A literature survey conducted for this review identified at
least 79 studies describing treatment and epidemiology of
Blastocystis (see additional file 1), but controlled investigation into the efficacy of drugs used in treatment is almost
non-existent. Only two studies have screened drugs in vitro
for effectiveness against Blastocystis [102,103]. The most
recent in vitro study is over 17 years old, and no study has
genotyped the Blastocystis isolates used, so it can not be
determined if the isolates used in those studies are the
same ones physicians seek to treat today.
The list of issues that complicates development of treatments for Blastocystis is long. Mouse models have existed
since 1997 [104], but no animal studies have been published to evaluate treatment efficacy of drugs. The development of antiprotozoal resistance may be a factor in
treatment failure, but there is a lack of evidence to show
that this drug (or any other) should be effective against
Blastocystis. Little is known about the organism's metabolic processes, although a recent study has identified the
role of Blastocystis' mitochondrion-like-organelles in the
reduction of ferrodoxins [105] that play a role in the conversion of metronidazole into its active state [106]. Metronidazole has been found to be one of the more effective
drugs in vitro [102], but in vitro effectiveness may not correlate well with animal study in the treatment of parasitic
infections [107]. Other factors in treatment failure, such
as treatment compliance, remain uninvestigated. Some
patients report an inability to complete metronidazole
treatment due to vomiting, or difficulty administering the
treatment to children (unpublished data, Kenneth
Boorom).
No study has been published to identify agents that would
be effective against the variants from IBS patient which
exhibit metronidazole and furazolidone resistance in vitro
[99]. Many drugs which have been reported to be effective
against infection have been removed from common clinical use [3], although it is not known if those drugs would
be effective in current infections. Many studies do not provide information about the length of time the patient had
been symptomatic or provide follow-up information on
the patient's condition. Most treatment studies lack information about the genotype being treated, so it is difficult
to assess their significance. The lack of a reliable diagnos-

tic method to determine if the infection has been eradicated complicates the evaluation of treatments.
Prevalence
Before discussing the prevalence of Blastocystis in the population, several points of interest should be addressed.
Because diagnostic methods vary widely in sensitivity, figures reported from studies may reflect the testing method
as much as the actual frequency of occurrence. Statistics
gathered from clinical diagnostic laboratories are often
reported as "prevalence," but as laboratory specimens are
often submitted with the intention of diagnosing an illness, this practice may overestimate the prevalence in the
population. Such numbers should properly be reported as
"frequency of detection of Blastocystis in laboratory samples by (method)."
Prevalence in China
The only extensive studies of Blastocystis prevalence have
been performed in China. A 2007 study evaluated 2321
samples taken from 4 geographic areas for Blastocystis
presence and genotype (Figure 5) [43]. The prevalence of
Blastocystis infection ranged from 1.9% in Shanghai
municipality (in the East) to 32.6% in Menghai county (in
the West).
Frequency of detection in United States and Canada
It has been suggested that case reports of Blastocystis
increased in frequency after 1984 [3]. An analysis of studies reporting the frequency of detection of Blastocystis from
North American laboratories suggests an increasing trend
that began after 1988, followed by a reducing trend that
began around 2000 (see Appendix A in additional file 1).
Controversy concerning Blastocystis may have been a
reflection of the disease's emergence, as the debate peaked
in the time period of 1988–1991, with a series of letters
exchanged between researchers in the Journal of Clinical
Microbiology [5,9,108-110].
Changing genotypes
Studies from the 1980's and early 1990's from the Western United States and Canada indicated that Blastocystis
was usually found as a co-infection, or was found in
asymptomatic patients [5] and was comparatively rare
[10,111]. These are characteristics associated with Blastocystis sp. subtype 2 [43,44,51]. A 2000 study found that
Blastocystis was much more prevalent and it was no longer
a co-infection in most patients which would be consistent
with the characteristics of Blastocystis sp. subtype 3
[44,48]. Patients who were singly infected with Blastocystis
were as likely to show symptoms as those singly infected
with Cryptosporidium. As such, the increase could have represented the emergence of a new subtype of Blastocystis in
the US population during the 1990's.

http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/1/1/40

The distribution shown in current studies usually identifies subtype 3 as the most common, with subtype 1 found
at a frequency of 10–60% of subtype 3. This pattern has
been found in varying geographic regions, such as China,
Greece, Denmark, and Singapore. While this may be a statistical anomaly, the etiology of this relationship may be
of interest.
Transmission mechanisms
Regardless of opinions concerning pathogenicity, the
existence of long-term trends in the prevalence of Blastocystis may be of scientific interest, especially when this
occurred during a time when the frequency of detection of
other enteric protozoa, such as Giardia lamblia and Entamoeba histolytica decreased [4,14]. Rising and falling prevalences have been found in propagated source epidemics
such as influenza, but these trends occur over shorter time
periods. A multi-year trend was reported in Scotland in
association with epidemic infection of farm animals with
Salmonella typhimurium and subsequent zoonotic transmission to the population [112]. The question of how
Blastocystis is able to spread in industrialized countries
with modern water treatment facilities remains to be
addressed, but researchers have reported potential vectors
as contaminated produce [113], sewage effluent [114],
and contamination of treated drinking water due to infiltration at points distant from the treatment facility [115].
Global trends
One study noted that case reports of Blastocystis infection
began to increase world-wide in 1984 [3]. Was the US
trend part of a larger global increase? Studies concerning
trends in Blastocystis infection are lacking, and many countries have historically used detection methods that have
been found to have a low sensitivity [116]. Trends in Blastocystis infection may be mirrored in the prevalence of
chronic lower gastrointestinal illness of unknown etiology. One study noted a statistically significant increase in
IBS prevalence in younger patient groups [117], but studies of the prevalence of IBS are lacking as well. Rates of
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are better documented, possibly because they result in hospital admissions. Researchers noted increases of 25–100% in the
incidence or rates of hospitalization for IBD during the
1990's in the United States [118], Ireland [119], Scotland
[120] and Italy [121] but not in Canada [122] or Minnesota [123]. In some areas, the increase was most pronounced in individuals 18-years old and younger, with a
doubling of the incidence of IBD in Scotland in individuals aged 12–18 years [120]. It is possible that other factors
could have contributed to an increase in chronic gastrointestinal illness of unknown etiology during this time
period. Researchers have cited the stress of city living [21]
and the stress of international travel [124] as factors in
development of such illness so it is possible that increased

Parasites & Vectors 2008, 1:40

urbanization and travel has lead to greater morbidity.
Serious gastrointestinal illness has been attributed to various viral and bacterial causes [125] and the hygiene
hypothesis, which suggests that lack of gastrointestinal
infection in childhood leads to chronic gastrointestinal
illness [126]. Additional research may be valuable in
understanding the relationship between trends in the
prevalence of unexplained chronic gastrointestinal illness
and poorly understood protozoal infections.
Pathogenesis
Studies of the pathogenesis of Blastocystis have focused on
immunological reactions of epithelial cells to proteases
secreted by Blastocystis. Co-culture studies of Blastocystis
have shown Blastocystis initially down-regulates and then
up-regulates production of the inflammatory cytokine IL8 in epithelial cells [127].

Specific in vitro co-culture studies have indicated that Blastocystis possesses pathogenicity mechanisms [83,128].
Pathogenesis was reported to result from interaction
between parasite products (e.g. cysteine protease from the
zoonotic isolate Blastocystis ratti WR1) and enterocytes that
influence host inflammatory and immunological
responses. Blastocystis ratti WR1 cysteine protease upregulated interleukin IL-8 gene expression through nuclear factor κB activation, but metronidazole treatment averted IL-8
production. Blastocystis also induced cell apoptosis, possibly in a subtype-dependent manner. An in vitro study also
reported that the activation of nuclear factor κB/inhibitor
of κB (NF-κB/IκB) signaling system lead to production of
pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-8, regulated
upon activation, normal T-cell expressed, and secreted
(RANTES) chemokines, and transforming-growth-factor
TGF-β resulting in intestinal inflammation [83].
The pathogenesis of Blastocystis has been problematic,
since the infection presents with abdominal pain in the
absence of endoscopic findings [129]. Recent research
into the etiology of abdominal pain, constipation and
diarrhea in patients with symptoms attributed to IBS has
suggested that the these symptoms are produced by high
levels of serine protease produced in the gastrointestinal
tract which are capable of exciting neurons directly
through the protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR2) pathway [84,89]. This may offer an explanation for the conundrum of patients who experience pain in gastrointestinal
illness in the absence of endoscopic findings [129].
While Blastocystis infection may be more serious in immunocompromised patients [130], studies have found that
the majority of patients with symptomatic Blastocystis
infection are immunocompetent, a pattern that is also
present in infection with Giardia and Entamoeba histolytica.
A Canadian study found that of 103 symptomatic patients
with findings of only Blastocystis infection, only 3 were

http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/1/1/40

immunocompromised. Outbreaks of symptomatic Blastocystis infection have occurred in demographic groups not
traditionally associated with immunocompromised status, such as groups of schoolchildren in the Middle East
[58] and parents and children from the same families
[131,132].
Conflicting research results
To better understand conflicting findings concerning Blastocystis pathogenicity, we surveyed studies in the US
National Institutes of Health Pubmed Database (see additional file 1). Studies reported pathogenicity in 84% (86/
102) of the cases, and non-pathogenicity in 16% (16/
102).

Many researchers identified a specific finding which they
felt would be inconsistent with the behavior of a pathogen, such as a lack of correlation between the quantity of
Blastocystis in stool samples and the patient's symptoms
[133] or the absence of endoscopic findings in symptomatic infection [129].
Appendix B (additional file 2) summarizes characteristics
of known gastrointestinal pathogens which may be of
value. Additional observations follow, with details in
additional file 3:
(1) All studies (16/16) finding Blastocystis to be non-pathogenic were conducted on subjects from more affluent
countries;
(2) All studies finding Blastocystis to be non-pathogenic
performed after 1994 used FECT or MIF for detection
[134-136];
(2) Findings of non-pathogenicity were much more likely
to have been reported by researchers studying Blastocystis
in North America before 1994 (additional file 3, P <
0.0022, Fisher's Exact Test);
(3) North American studies reporting pathogenicity were
often conducted in laboratories in coastal cities (Vancouver, New York, Palo Alto) which served individuals with
travel history to less developed countries [6] or processed
large numbers of samples (> 2,500) from the community
[10,111]. Studies conducted on the more insular population of a health maintenance organization found Blastocystis to be non-pathogenic [5,9,137-140].
The variable sensitivity of diagnostic techniques discussed
earlier may be responsible for some of the disagreement.
Additional causes may include:
Blastocystis sp. subtype 2 may have been the dominant
genotype in the United States in the early 1990's : During this time, immigrants from Southeast Asia had a high

Parasites & Vectors 2008, 1:40

rate of infection which was difficult to detect [109]. The
description of Blastocystis as a co-infection in symptomatic
patients from Californian physicians in the 1980's [139]
is consistent with the behavior of Blastocystis sp. subtype 2
[44]. Blastocystis acquired overseas was associated with
symptomatic infection, while US-acquired blastocystosis
was asymptomatic [6]. Following an increase in detection
rates of Blastocystis in the 1990's (see Appendix A in additional file 1), US studies now show Blastocystis appearing
frequently as a symptomatic mono-infection [14] with
characteristics similar to Cryptosporidium parvum and Entamoeba histolytica. (Figure 8).
Symptomatic carriage of enteric protozoa may be mediated by host genetics (see Appendix B in additional file
2) : In affluent countries, if symptomatic carriers can seek
and receive treatment, they may leave a population of
asymptomatic carriers to be studied by epidemiologists.
Studies may have fulfilled many criteria listed in a 1990
communication as necessary to establish the pathogenicity of Blastocystis [110]: fulfillment of Koch's postulates
[48,104,141]; identification of an immune response
[82,85,86];

[94,143,144]; and description of point source outbreak of
diarrhea where Blastocystis was the cause [57,131,145].

Conclusion
1. Blastocystis comprises a group of genetically diverse
organisms, some of which will cause chronic or acute
infection in some immunocompetent humans. The
behavior of Blastocystis in humans is consistent with that
of Giardia and Entamoeba histolytica – expression of symptoms depends on parasite genotype, host genotype, host
immunity, and age. Parasite genotype may vary geographically along with other factors.
2. Most diagnostics and treatments in clinical use for blastocystosis have been shown to have low sensitivity. Stool
culture may provide the best short-term option for
improving sensitivity, with serum antibody testing being
a better option if it becomes available. PCR testing is currently the only way to identify the genotype of Blastocystis
isolates.
3. Researchers from less affluent countries consistently
report that Blastocystis is pathogenic, while some research-

The characteristics of common enteric protozoa reported in study of 5792 specimens from US patients collected in 200014[14]. Studies from the 1980's reported Blastocystis was usually found as a co-infection with Giardia or Entamoeba histolytica in symptomatic patients [139,140], which was not the case in 2000 [14]. In 2000, the number of symptomatic
patients who were found to be singly infected with Blastocystis (400) exceeded the number of samples found positive for Cryptosporidium, Giardia, and Entamoeba histolytica combined. Patients singly infected with Blastocystis were as likely to be symptomatic as patients singly infected with Cryptosporidium (69% vs. 70%) [14].

ers in more affluent countries have authored contradictory studies. The outcome has been that little clinical
research is performed or supported by affluent countries,
while less affluent countries now publish sophisticated
studies

infection
[43,51,53,75,94,146,147].
4. Blastocystis has met all criteria for pathogenicity that are
met by Giardia and Entamoeba histolytica, such as fulfillment Koch's Postulates [48,104,141,148], demonstration
of a treatment that eliminates the organism and the symptoms, an immune response that is elevated in symptomatic individuals [36], and a positive association with
symptoms in most studies. Blastocystis fails to meet criteria
which Giardia and Entamoeba histolytica fail to meet. For
example, all persons infected are not symptomatic; all
researchers in all geographies have not shown an association between infection and symptoms; and the use of
inadequate methods in some historical studies has produced the appearance of non-pathogenicity [149,150].
