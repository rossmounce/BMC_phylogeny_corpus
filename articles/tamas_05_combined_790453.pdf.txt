Abstract
Background: Many aspects of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans biology are conserved
between invertebrates and vertebrates establishing this particular organism as an excellent genetic
model. Because of its small size, large populations and self-fertilization of the hermaphrodite,
functional predictions carried out by genetic modifications as well as RNAi screens, can be rapidly
tested.
Results: In order to explore the function of a set of C. elegans genes of unknown function, as well
as their potential functional roles in the human genome, we performed a phylogenetic analysis to
select the most probable worm orthologs. A total of 13 C. elegans genes were subjected to downregulation via RNAi and characterization of expression profiles using GFP strains. Previously
unknown distinct expression patterns were observed for four of the analyzed genes, as well as four
visible RNAi phenotypes. In addition, subcellular protein over-expression profiles of the human
orthologs for seven out of the thirteen genes using human cells were also analyzed.
Conclusion: By combining a whole-organism approach using C. elegans with complementary
experimental work done on human cell lines, this analysis extends currently available information
on the selected set of genes.

Background
Many aspects of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans biology are conserved between invertebrates and vertebrates
establishing this particular organism as an excellent
genetic model. Because of its small size, large populations
and self-fertilization of the hermaphrodite, functional
predictions carried out by genetic modifications as well as
RNAi screens, can be rapidly tested. This is an obvious
advantage when compared to the increasingly complex

Drosophila and mouse genomes. Therefore, the nematode
C. elegans has emerged as an excellent entry point to begin
to address these predictions. There are currently two main
approaches in C. elegans to investigate gene function on a
genomic scale using reverse-genetics. The first one is based
on RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) where "functional
knock-outs" of a particular gene can be studied and phenotypes identified. The other is a PCR -based technology
to identify genetic mutants in a mutagenized library.

Complementary expression data can also be acquired
from microarray data or by Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) to identify genes that are co-expressed or up/
down regulated under defined conditions. These methods
can be directly combined, on a particular set of genes, to
provide a comprehensive description of the gene's expression patterns and functions [1]. In addition, results can be
refined using independent screens of other experimental
systems, for example human cell lines.

families was selected for functional analysis in both C. elegans and human cell lines.

RNAi based on the introduction of double-stranded RNA
(dsRNA) is the method that results in specific inactivation
of the corresponding gene through the degradation of
endogenous mRNA. It was originally described in C. elegans [2,3] and has become the main reverse-genetics tool
for determining the function of specific genes. Several
large-scale studies involving C. elegans [4-7], subjected
approximately 90% of the 19,427 predicted genes to
down regulation via RNAi. Moreover, individual clones of
the entire RNAi feeding library described in Fraser et al. [5]
can be ordered directly. In addition, in vitro synthesis of
~21-nt small interfering RNAs to mediate gene-specific
suppression in mammalian cells have been developed in
order to extend this particular technique to higher eukaryotes [8].

We have sought to identify, through phylogenetic analysis, the most likely worm orthologs for a set of human
genes. Expression patterns and RNAi data in the worm
were obtained, as well as corresponding data using
human cell lines.

80% of C. elegans genes have human homologs [9]. As
long as we are able to establish orthology, information
obtained for a gene sequence in one organism is potentially transferable to the other [10]. Nevertheless, since the
human and the worm genomes are phylogenetically very
distant, in many cases these sequences are only able to
produce poorly supported trees. Moreover, position of
individual branches may not be conserved between different algorithms for finding distance trees. Phylogenetic
reconstructions involving human/worm sequences in a
number of cases are unable to resolve their exact phylogenetic past. In the case of orthology assignments they provide only an indication for its existence.
Moreover, sequence orthology does not necessarily imply
the same function. However, genes shown to be descendants of the same gene (orthologous genes) have, in general retained the same function over the course of
evolution [10]. If so, it is important to select for analysis
only the genes where a clear orthology assignment can be
established.
Based on a collection of uncharacterized protein families
derived from a comparison of three available genomes
including H. sapiens, C. elegans and D. melanogaster, an
integrated in-house program for functional gene annotation was initiated. As part of this annotation effort, a set of
genes originating from this collection of novel protein

In this study novel protein families are explored using a
diverse set of technologies involving both in silico and
experimental analysis with the intention of identifying
interesting gene candidates showing evidence of highly
conserved function which may serve as potential drug targets in the future.

Results and Discussion
Phylogenetic analysis: the most likely ortholog?
Multiple gene duplication followed by massive gene loss
and acquisition of novel functions has been shaping the
evolution of distant organisms. In a search for the most
likely orthologs, special attention must be paid to the fate
of duplicated genes when related to speciation. Duplicated genes tend to evolve in different patterns following
the duplication event arising from different functional
constrains [11].

According to Remm et al. and Sonnhammer and Koonin,
out-paralogs are paralogs that predate speciation [12,13].
By contrast, in-paralogs are genes that arose after speciation. Therefore, all in-paralogs are considered potential
functional orthologs. Using translated sequence we compare maximum parsimony trees to neighbor joining counterparts. Genes for which the position of the branches (in
particular the branches leading to C. elegans and its closest
human homolog) was conserved between both algorithms chosen for finding distance trees (Neighbor joining versus Maximum Parsimony), were selected for the
experimental study (Tab. 1.). This criterion has been used
in order to eliminate genes producing unstable topologies
caused by duplications or a generally weak phylogenetic
signal. Also, in this way it was possible to infer the
homolog which most likely retained the ancestral gene
function.
Unique orthologous gene pairs are difficult to identify
using standard similarity searches, as multiple candidate
genes are typically obtained. Our trees typically contain
two or more human homologs showing significant
sequence similarity to a single worm gene (Fig. 1). Therefore, we selected candidate genes by choosing genes that
produced trees that allow for identification of single
human sequences as the most probable orthologs. These
trees clearly discriminate out-paralogs or other in-paralogs (Fig. 1A and 1B). In effect, well-supported trees

showing a one-to-one relationship between human and
worm sequence were selected. However, since the purpose
of this analysis was to identify genes that most likely
retained the same function rather than orthology sensu
stricto, it is possible that in some cases a paralog (in-paralog) was selected as the most promising ortholog. In other
words, the C. elegans genes that we identified are either
true orthologs or the best in-paralogs to the corresponding human genes [12]. Despite the fact that the exact type
of orthology encountered in individual trees could not
always be identified, we find this level of resolution satisfactory for the purposes of this study.
Thus, phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1A and 1B) predicts
F41D9.1 (Q94222) to have a similar function to human
CAA18266. The tree also assigns other human sequences,
namely BAA83007 and AAL55877, which are apparently
a product of a duplication event in the mouse/human lineages, as either out-paralogs or in-paralogs. Regardless of
their exact orthology/paralogy relation to the worm
sequence, neither of them is the most probable ortholog.
To the contrary, a frequently encountered situation was
obtained in the case of the worm gene C13F10.4 (Fig. 1C
and 1D). The two human sequences though rather similar
having a protein matrix distance of 0.61482 (Philip package), were easily separated in both the Neighbor Joining
tree (NJ tree) and the Maximum Parsimony tree (MP tree).
The NJ tree in particular demonstrates that the gene was
duplicated in the animal series starting from Gallus sp. and
upwards. Thus, in an ideal case, phylogenetic analyzes
would correctly identify the exact copy of the duplicated
gene in the human genome and assign it to a single C. elegans sequence as its true ortholog, as shown for F41D9.1

(Fig. 1A and 1B). The position of the other copy would
point to its paralogous/in-paralogous relation to the
worm sequence. However, the worm gene is either weakly
associated with the branch leading to both human
sequences (NJ tree, Fig. 1C) and it forms a separate branch
with the XP_113763 human sequence (MP tree, Fig. 1D).
C. elegans genes and their most probable human
orthologs are shown in the Tab. 1. Interestingly, due to the
strict criteria we applied in order to select the most likely
human orthologs, even C27A7.1, a known disease gene
http://www.wormbase.org, which is regarded as orthologous to the human gene NPPASE (ENPP1;
OMIM:173335) was not identified.
Expression profiles and RNAi phenotypes
A distinct GFP expression: F41D9.1, C17E4.3, ZK795.3 and
C09D4.1
Here we report GFP expression under the control of a
putative promoter for F41D9.1 that occurs predominantly
in many neural cells in the head around the posterior pharyngeal bulb, along the ventral nerve cord and in the tail
(Fig 2). Head neurons include clusters in the dorsal and
retrovesicular ganglia as well as the sensory amphid neurons. Expression is present in both larval and adult stages.
No other phenotype was observed following down-regulation which is in accordance to previously published
results by [14].

The C17E4.3::GFP reporter is expressed in the developing
embryo and L1 larval stages, in three distinct sheath/
socket cells in the head region close to the anterior bulb of
the pharynx and several cells around the anus (Fig 3).
Expression is also seen in several pharyngeal muscle cells.

ZK795.3::GFP reporter expression. Evident in the excretory cell system (panel A) in about 20% of animals, but was always
present in the excretory cell (labeled 'ex', panels A and Bi). The anal sphincter and/or depressor cell around the anus ('cl') also
expressed GFP (panel Bii), as did the juvenile vulva ('v', panel Biii) and the spermathecae (panel C). Scale bar represents 10 µm.

Dye filling tests confirmed that the processes extending to
the nose were not from amphid neurons, but rather from
socket cells (Fig 3, panel C). The expression occurs exclusively in the developing embryo and L1 larval stage suggesting involvement of the gene in development. No
RNAi phenotype was associated with this gene. The wild
type phenotype, following down-regulation, was also
obtained by Simmer et al. [7]. However, the results
obtained by Piano et al. [15] show that silencing of the

gene results in embryonic lethality. Nevertheless, inconsistent phenotypes have been obtained by different
groups for several other genes [16].
ZK795.3::GFP expression pattern includes spermatheca,
hypodermal cells, pharynx and the excretory cell and
channels (Fig 4). In the L3 stage, expression was seen in
the vulva, and in P6.p descendants.

sis where it possibly promotes filling an extracellular
space with fluid [17].
Following exposure to the corresponding dsRNA, a
smaller F1 population size was observed when compared
to the control animals in the both N2 and NL2099. F2
animals show a robust RNAi-induced phenotype including: sickly appearance, partial sterility, and small brood
size. Lethality was observed in F3 embryos in the rrf-3
background at 20°C. The partial sterility among the F2
animals is in accordance with the reported http://
www.wormbase.org mutant phenotype (self-sterile hermaphrodites). All the phenotypes indicated above were
reduced in the N2 background and also when grown at
15°C. Additional mutant phenotypes included squashed
vulva (Sqv), and reduced L4 vulva invagination http://
www.wormbase.org. However, according to Fraser et al.
[5], down-regulation via RNAi did not produce a distinct
phenotype. This is possibly due to the large-scale nature of
their study and its focus on early developmental stages.
For F23C8.6, our results revealed slow growth (Gro) and
uncoordinated behavior (Unc) which are both in agreement with the results obtained by Fraser et al. [5]. Our
observations also confirmed larval arrest as reported previously [7]. As with T24D.1, ZK795.3 and B0379.4a,
down-regulation of F23C8.6 did not affect life span. Gene
function related to growth, larval development and locomotory behavior have been also inferred from the mutant
phenotype http://www.wormbase.org.

C09D4.1 had a simple expression pattern limited to intestinal cells in all developmental stages (Fig 5).
Visible RNAi phenotypes: T24D1.1, F23C8.6, ZK795.3 and
B0379.4a
To investigate in detail the RNAi effects on growth, brood
size and life span, we have closely followed a population
of embryos (N2 and rrf-3 (NL2099) to full development
at 20°C, in RNAi plates for corresponding genes with visible RNAi phenotypes.

C. elegans SQV-5 14162 protein (WP:CE 14162) encoded
by T24D.1 gene is a chondroitin synthase that initiates/
elongates chondroitin chains. This protein is also required
for cytokinesis, gonad migration and vulval morphogene-

Down-regulation of ZK795.3 affects the growth rate significantly in both wild type and the hypersensitive
NL2099 strain (rrf-3). At 20°C growth was 10–15 times
slower then the wild type control, slightly more pronounced in the rrf-3 strain. A large proportion of sterile F2
(Stp) animals was also observed. The minority of animals
that were fertile produced very few eggs but these eggs
were as viable as wild type. According to the previous
studies down-regulation of the same gene has produced
the following phenotypes: Gro, Emb, Stp, Lva [7,14,15].
Our results for down-regulation of B0379.4a are consistent with the data obtained by Kamath et al. [14]. RNAi
resulted in an Egl phenotype that was more pronounced
in the rrf-3 background. The involvement of the gene in
oviposition was inferred from the mutant phenotype
http://www.wormbase.org. The gene has orthologous
sequences in both the human and mouse genomes that
code for a small CTD phosphatase and nuclear LIM interactor-interacting factor 2, respectively.
RNAi on C05C8.6 has been reported by Simmer et al. as
Emb, Lva and Lvl [7]. However, our results are consistent
with another study published by Kamath et al. where no

specific phenotype was observed [14]. The mutant
phenotype of C05C8.6 points to its involvement in
embryonic and larval development with a molecular function associated with protein binding http://www.worm
base.org.
Although a greater proportion of genes show specific
RNAi phenotypes when using rrf-3 strain [7], our results
point to an increase in the severity of the phenotypes following down-regulation in the rrf-3 background, rather
than additional phenotypes.
Subcellular localization in human cell lines
For seven of the human orthologs presented in this study,
we cloned full-length open reading frames (ORFs), representing encoded cDNAs, into vectors containing V5
epitope sequences in order to generate recombinant
fusion proteins for immunofluorescence detection.
Because of the novelty of these proteins and the lack of
available antibodies against such proteins, it was necessary to overexpress in human cell lines and subsequently
detect with antibodies against the V5 fusion tag.
Subcellular localizations were obtained in two human cell
lines: HeLa and Human Embryonic Kidney 293
(HEK293). Endogenous expression for the proteins studied in the two cell lines was confirmed by RT-PCR.

NP_219484, human ortholog for ZK795.3, displays three
distinct patterns: diffuse nuclear, nucleolar and nuclear
foci (Figure 6A). We were able to confirm the nucleolar
pattern by colocalization with fibrillarin, a protein predominantly found in nucleoli and cajal bodies. We were
unable to determine the exact sub-compartment to which
the nuclear foci belong. However, the pattern is strikingly
similar to that of paraspeckles. The proteins, described as
U3 snoRNP protein 4 homologs, belong to the IMP4 family of proteins which are small ribonucleoproteins
involved in pre-ribosomal RNA processing. These results
are consistent with those previously obtained in yeast and
recently described in human [18]. Based on the interaction of these proteins with snoRNA in 60-80S RNP complexes and their likely involvement in pre-rRNA
processing, it is possible to speculate that the preferred
location of the Imp4 protein is both transient and
dynamic throughout the nucleus, which would explain
the three patterns we observe.
NP_848545 also described as hypothetical protein
MGC48332 and predicted ortholog of worm protein
C17E4.3 displayed a nuclear and perinuclear pattern covering the entire circumference of the nucleus but did not
appear to be inside the nucleus. We were able to confirm
the presence of this protein at the nuclear membrane by
colocalization with Lamin, denoting a possible role for
this protein as part of the nuclear envelope (Figure 6B).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/65

C3HC4 which contains a RING-finger motif, has been
classified as the third member (MARCH-III) of the
recently defined membrane-associated RING-CH protein
family [19]. The same authors reported that proteins
belonging to this family, including MARCH-III, characteristically contain two predicted C-terminal transmembrane
domains, indicating a possible association with membrane-bound organelles. Furthermore, Bartee et al. concluded that localization of human MARCH III by fusion
protein overexpression revealed a punctate pattern partially overlapping with cytoplasmic vesicles, specifically
early endosomes. However, we were unable to confirm
this finding. It is important to note that proteins are, in
many cases, dynamic in location meaning that there are
potentially multiple locations. Thus, our co-staining data
are the most compelling we have seen.
AAK25825/NP_079514, also described as BTB/POZ
domain containing 1 (BTBD1), exhibited a cytoplasmic
pattern resembling elongated "worm-like" bodies for
which we were unable to determine a known structure
(data not shown). Members of this domain family have
been shown to interact with co-repressor complexes
involved in transcriptional repression [20-22]. Previously,
BTBD1 has been shown to interact specifically with topoisomerase I [23]. In addition, a recent study further characterized BTBD1 as colocalizing with TRIM family members
[24]. Interestingly, TRIM proteins have been shown to
exhibit ubiquitin ligase activity.
NP_115683 has no functional annotation and has only
been described as an open reading frame located on
human chromosome 9. This protein exhibits weak expression when "overexpressed" under control of CMV promoter. Immunofluourescence shows this protein to have
both a cytoplasmic and a nuclear distribution. Furthermore, the cytoplasmic expression appears punctate and
partially colocalizes with calreticulin, a marker for endoplasmic reticulum (Figure 6C).
AAP34400.1/JC5707 is a member of a family of small Cterminal domain phosphatase (SCP3) and contains an
NIF domain (Nuclear Lim Interacting factor-like phosphatase). Other members of this family have been shown
to interact with RNA polymerase II and show nuclear
localization (SCP1) [25]. Surprisingly, SCP3 was detected
at the plasma membrane by colocalization with annexin
II, a known component of the plasma membrane (left
panel, Figure 3D). In addition to this pattern, we noted
fibrous structures that partially colocalized with beta-actin
(right panel, Figure 6D).
Hypothetical protein NP_056520 expression was detected
by western blot and immunofluorescence microscopy
(data not shown). Microscopy detection displayed a

anti-rabbit Cy3 illustrating a colocalization with the nuclear envelope (B). Partial ER and nuclear distributions were observed

cytoplasmic/nuclear rim staining pattern. However, western blot analysis revealed a molecular weight of approximately 50 kDa which is inconsistent with the predicted
size of 80 kDa, indicating a possible premature stop in
translation or post-translational cleavage. In addition, we
were unable to detect ectopic expression for NP_060123.
Any attempts to detect this protein via western blot or
microscopy were unsuccessful despite sequence validation of the corresponding expression plasmid.

Conclusion
Specific expression patterns have been identified for the
F41D9.1, ZK795.3, C17E4.3 and C09D4.1 GFP-fusion
strains. Visible RNAi phenotypes for T24D1.1, F23C8.6,
ZK795.3 and B0379.4a were observed. RNAi on T24D1.1a
produced an extensive phenotype that was not revealed in
the large-scale study by Fraser et al. [5]. Thus, our study
shows the value of analyzes focusing on a small number

of candidate genes where a variety rather then a predefined set of phenotypes are observed. In addition,

NP_056520 has detected subcellular localization of the
corresponding proteins. The most complete data set comprising both a visible RNAi phenotype or/and a distinct
GFP expression in C. elegans and a subcellular protein
over-expression profile using human cell lines has been
obtained for ZK795.3 (NP_219484), F41D9.1
(NP_056520) and C17E4.3 (NP_848515) (Tab. 2).
In the case of genes F41D9.1 and C17E4.3, a mainly neuronal GFP expression was detected. Therefore, the absence
of an observable RNAi phenotype may be explained by
the known refractory nature of RNAi in this tissue. For the
gene ZK795.3, which showed a more generalized effect on

the development, corresponding widespread expression
pattern was observed in the worm and in human cell
lines. Given that the protein prediction indicates this gene
as a snoRNP candidate, its involvement in a variety of
cellular processes thus can be expected. To the contrary,
restricted subcellular expression patterns in human cells
observed in a few cases, for example the AAK25825
(F38H4.7) and NP_115683C11D2.4 genes (Tab. 2), correlate with the absence of phenotypes other than the wild
type. This fact suggests that these genes may be of somewhat lesser importance.
In conclusion, this comparative C. elegans-human cell
lines study based on orthology assignments explores gene
functionality by combining two key aspects of functional
genomics: a whole organism approach and protein overexpression data using cells lines.
Our results extend currently available information on the
selected genes providing a step more towards identifying
their exact function.

Methods
Phylogenetic analysis
In order to select candidate genes for the RNAi experiments phylogenetic reconstructions were performed as
follows: C. elegans and related sequences were collected
from Genelynx http://www.genelynx.org or/and Wormbase http://www.wormbase.org. The data set typically
included several homologs of the model organisms (yeast,
fly, etc.) and one or more human sequences. Multiple
sequences alignments were done using ClustalW [26].
Phylogenetic trees implemented by the SeaView and

Diffuse nuclear, nucleolar, nuclear
foci
Perinuclear/nuclear lamina

Cytoskeletal/plasma membrane
Protein not detected

Phylo_win program [27] were constructed by using maximum parsimony and the neighbor-joining method with
500 bootstrap replicates. Only genes producing well-supported trees (bootstrap value > 50), with the same branch
positions, when applying both maximum parsimony and
neighbor joining method were selected (Fig. 1.).
Generation of bacterial feeding library
Total N2 RNA extract was used to synthesize cDNA
(Reverse Transcription System; Promega). A pair of oligonucleotides that had restriction sites for XmaI (extremely
rare sites in the worm genome) was designed for each predicted coding sequence. PCR products of the selected
genes were generated using the RT-PCR mixture as template. In addition, primers for spliced leaders SL1 and SL2
were also used. PCR products were ligated into previously
digested L4440 (double-T7 vector, Fire lab, http://
genome-www.stanford.edu/group/fire/) using Rapid
DNA Ligation Kit (Roche). Plasmids were transformed
into E. coli JM109. Plates were screened for recombinant
clones by restriction analysis of plasmid minipreps. Positive clones were grown in overnight cultures. Plasmids
were extracted by QIAfilter Plasmid Kit (QIAGEN).
Clones were sequenced and used to transform E. coli
HT115, an RNaseIII-deficient strain used to feed the
nematodes.
RNAi by feeding
RNAi plates were prepared by spreading 200 µl of the bacterial liquid cultures per small (6 cm diameter) NGM
plates supplemented with 1 mM IPTG and 25 µg/ml
carbenicillin. Plates were seeded with N2 eggs prepared
with the standard bleaching method. The hatched worms

and their progeny (four generations) were screened for
phenotypes other than wild type. As a positive control, the
HT115 E. coli strain transformed with the unc-22 gene
("twitchin") was used (Fire lab vector pPD34.09). N2
strain was incubated at 15 and 25°C. All the experiments
were repeated using the NL2099 strain (rrf-3) incubated at
15 and 20°C since it is known for a temperature-dependent decrease in the brood size [28,29]. Plates seeded with
the empty vector were used as a negative control.
Gene expression profiles
GFP strains were made by transcriptional fusions of putative promoters (1–2.5 Kb) with GFP using a fusion PCR
technique as described by Hubert O. [29].
Estimation of the life span, brood size, embryonic lethality
and duration of the larval stages
NL2099 and N2 worms were grown on plates seeded with
bacteria containing double-T7 (L4440) vector without
insert and as well as corresponding RNAi plates. Individual F1 eggs were transferred onto 10 fresh plates and their
development followed at 20°C. Individual worms were
transferred every 24 h onto fresh plates. The total number
of F2 eggs on the plate was counted, as well as the number
of eggs that did not hatch. Individual worms were
observed daily until they died to ascertain their lifespan.
Microscopy
Microscopy was carried out with a Zeiss Axioplan system
complete with filters for visualizing rhodamine and GFP
fluorescence. A Hamamatsu black and white and Zeiss
Axiocam colour camera were used for capturing images.
Images were processed in Adobe Photoshop. Some
images were processed with Openlab 3D restoration software to increase image clarity.

Dye filling experiments were done to assist in identifying
cells. Briefly, worms were incubated for an hour in DiI
stain and observed with a microscope under UV light
through a rhodamine filter. Only amphids and phasmids
were stained.
Exogenous protein expression and immunofluorescence
detection in human cell lines
Plasmid constructs containing full-length genes of interest
were generated according to previously described methods [30]. Briefly, full-length open reading frames were
cloned into a mammalian expression vector containing a
CMV promoter and an in-frame N-terminal or C-terminal
V5 epitope tag in order to generate fusion proteins for
expression studies (pcDNA-DEST40™, Invitrogen).
HEK293 and HeLa cells (ATCC) were maintained at 37°C,
5% CO2 in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM)
supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 U/ml Penicillin/
Streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were seeded on glass

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/65

coverslips at 80% confluency 24 hours prior to transfection in DMEM containing 10% FBS without antibiotics.
Cells were transiently transfected for 24–48 hours with
Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer's recommendations. Cells were fixed with
2% paraformaldehyde/1.5% sucrose in PBS for 15 minutes at room temperature (RT), after which cells were
treated with 0.5% triton-X 100 in PBS for 5 minutes. Cells
were incubated for 30 minutes at RT in blocking buffer
(2% BSA in PBS) before detection with the primary antibodies. Fusion proteins were detected with either goat
anti-V5 (1:500, Bethyl Laboratories) conjugated with a
FITC label or an unlabeled mouse anti-V5 (1:200, Invitrogen) for which a secondary detection with goat antimouse Alexa 488 (1:1000, Molecular Probes) was performed. Diluted antibodies were applied to coverslips and
incubated at 37°C for 2 hours before washing in PBS.
Samples were co-stained with the following organelle-specific antibodies and corresponding dilutions: rabbit anticalreticulin (1:200, Affinity Bioreagents), human anti
fibrillarin (1:100, a gift from Dr. N. Ringertz, Karolinska
Institute), rabbit anti Lamin (aLi, 1:200, a gift from Dr. G.
Simos, EMBL), mouse anti Annexin II (1:250, BD Transduction Laboratories), mouse anti beta-actin (1:500,
Sigma). For both the annexin II and the beta-actin antibodies it was necessary to perform Methanol:Acetone
(1:1) fixation for 10 minutes instead of paraformaldehyde
fixation and triton-x treatment.
Secondary antibody detection was performed at RT for 45
minutes with the following antibodies: anti human-Cy3
(1:1000, Amersham), donkey anti rabbit-Cy3 (1:1000,
Jackson), donkey anti mouse-Cy3 (1:1000, Jackson). Coverslips were mounted on slides with Prolong Anti-Fade
(Molecular Probes) mounting media. Slides were viewed
by Leica DMRA2 and DMRXA microscopes with epifluorescence and images were captured with Openlab™ software version 3.1.4.
