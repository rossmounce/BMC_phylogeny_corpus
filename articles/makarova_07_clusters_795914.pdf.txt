Abstract
Background: An evolutionary classification of genes from sequenced genomes that distinguishes between
orthologs and paralogs is indispensable for genome annotation and evolutionary reconstruction. Shortly after
multiple genome sequences of bacteria, archaea, and unicellular eukaryotes became available, an attempt on such
a classification was implemented in Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins (COGs). Rapid accumulation of
genome sequences creates opportunities for refining COGs but also represents a challenge because of error
amplification. One of the practical strategies involves construction of refined COGs for phylogenetically compact
subsets of genomes.
Results: New Archaeal Clusters of Orthologous Genes (arCOGs) were constructed for 41 archaeal genomes
(13 Crenarchaeota, 27 Euryarchaeota and one Nanoarchaeon) using an improved procedure that employs a
similarity tree between smaller, group-specific clusters, semi-automatically partitions orthology domains in
multidomain proteins, and uses profile searches for identification of remote orthologs. The annotation of arCOGs
is a consensus between three assignments based on the COGs, the CDD database, and the annotations of
homologs in the NR database. The 7538 arCOGs, on average, cover ~88% of the genes in a genome compared
to a ~76% coverage in COGs. The finer granularity of ortholog identification in the arCOGs is apparent from the
fact that 4538 arCOGs correspond to 2362 COGs; ~40% of the arCOGs are new. The archaeal gene core
(protein-coding genes found in all 41 genome) consists of 166 arCOGs. The arCOGs were used to reconstruct
gene loss and gene gain events during archaeal evolution and gene sets of ancestral forms. The Last Archaeal
Common Ancestor (LACA) is conservatively estimated to possess 996 genes compared to 1245 and 1335 genes
for the last common ancestors of Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota, respectively. It is inferred that LACA was a
chemoautotrophic hyperthermophile that, in addition to the core archaeal functions, encoded more idiosyncratic
systems, e.g., the CASS systems of antivirus defense and some toxin-antitoxin systems.
Conclusion: The arCOGs provide a convenient, flexible framework for functional annotation of archaeal
genomes, comparative genomics and evolutionary reconstructions. Genomic reconstructions suggest that the last
common ancestor of archaea might have been (nearly) as advanced as the modern archaeal hyperthermophiles.

Background
A robust classification of genes based on accurately deciphered evolutionary relationships is the cornerstone of
comparative and evolutionary genomics. Such a classification is indispensable both for the functional annotation
of sequenced genomes and for any genome-wide evolutionary reconstruction. The construction of an evolutionary classification of genes is a non-trivial task because of
the complexity of homologous relationships between
genes. The two principal classes of homologs are
orthologs and paralogs. Orthologs are homologous genes
that evolved via vertical descent from a single ancestral
gene in the last common ancestor of the compared species. Paralogs are homologous genes, which, at some stage
of evolution, have evolved by duplication of an ancestral
gene [1,2]. Orthology and paralogy are intimately linked
because, if a duplication (or a series of duplications)
occurs after the speciation event that separated the compared species, orthology becomes a relationship between
sets of paralogs, rather than individual genes (in which
case, such genes are called co-orthologs).
Correct identification of orthologs and paralogs is of central importance for both the functional and the evolutionary aspects of comparative genomics. Orthologs typically
occupy the same functional niche in different organisms;
by contrast, paralogs evolve to functional diversification
as they diverge after the duplication [3,4]. Therefore, the
accuracy of genome annotation critically depends on the
accurate identification of orthologs [5]. A clear demarcation of orthologs and paralogs is also required for constructing evolutionary scenarios which include, along
with vertical inheritance, lineage-specific gene loss and
horizontal gene transfer (HGT) [6-8].
In principle, orthologs, including co-orthologs, should be
identified by means of phylogenetic analysis of entire
families of homologous proteins in the compared
genomes, which is expected to define orthologous protein
sets as clades. However, for genome-wide protein sets,
such analysis remains extremely labor-intensive, and
error-prone as well [9]. Accordingly, procedures have been
developed for identification of sets of likely orthologs
without an explicit referral to phylogenetic analysis. These
procedures are based on the notion of a genome-specific
best hit (BeT), i.e., the protein from a target genome that
is most similar (typically, in terms of similarity scores
computed using BLAST or another sequence comparison
method) to a given protein from the query genome
[10,11]. The assumption central to this approach is that
orthologs have a greater similarity to each other than to
any other protein from the respective genomes. When
multiple genomes are analyzed, pairs of probable
orthologs detected on the basis of BeTs are combined into
orthologous clusters represented in all or a subset of the

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/33

analyzed genomes. This approach, amended with additional procedures for detecting co-orthologous protein
sets and for treating multidomain proteins, was implemented in the database of Clusters of Orthologous
Groups (COGs) of proteins [11,12]. The latest COG set
released in 2003 includes ~70% of the proteins encoded
in 69 genomes of prokaryotes and unicellular eukaryotes
[13]. The COGs have been employed for functional annotation of newly sequenced genomes (e.g. [14,15], comparative analysis of gene neighborhoods [16-18] and other
types of connections between genes, as implemented in
the widely used STRING tool [19], target selection in
structural genomics (e.g. [20], and various genome-wide
evolutionary analyses [7,8]. Independently, other groups
have developed similar methodologies for identification
of orthologs and paralogs in pairwise or multiple genome
comparisons [21,22]. Very recently, a major effort on
automatic construction of sets of orthologous genes has
culminated in the EggNOG database which employed the
COGs as a prototype and a seed [23].
The methods for the construction of COGs were developed and originally applied to small sets of genomes;
these and other related methods do not guarantee correct
identification of the paralogous and orthologous relationships, due to the variability of domain architectures of
proteins, differential loss of paralogs in different lineages,
extreme divergence of some orthologous and paralogous
genes, and other complications [2,12,13]. The computational cost of exhaustive genome comparisons also grows
almost prohibitively with the steep increase in the
number of sequenced genomes which approached 500 in
the beginning of 2007 [24]. Thus, several smaller scale
studies have been conducted in which COGs were constructed for compact groups of bacteria including the
Thermus-Deinococcus group [25], Cyanobacteria [26], and
Lactobacillales [15]. In each of these analyses, a considerably better resolution of the homologous relationship than
in the overall COG set has been achieved.
In the previous comparative-genomic analyses of archaea,
we delineated COGs for this domain of life and used them
to partition archaeal genes into the evolutionarily stable,
conserved core and the "shell" of genes that are often lost
during evolution or are characteristic of a narrow group of
species [27]; we further traced the dynamics of drop in the
number of the core genes with sequencing of additional
archaeal genomes [28,29].
Here we present the updated set of COGs that includes 41
sequenced archaeal genomes and delineate the core sets of
genes that are represented in all archaea or in the major
archaeal divisions, Euryarchaeota and Crenarchaeota. We
further describe evolutionary reconstructions aimed at
inferring the nature of the Last Archaeal Common Ances-

tor (LACA) and other ancestral forms, and uncovering the
trends of gene loss and gain during archaeal evolution.

Results and Discussion
The archaeal genomic data set and construction of
archaeal COGs
Table 1 lists the basic features of the analyzed archaeal
genomes. The now available set of genomes represents
reasonably well the genomic, taxonomic, and ecological
diversity of archaea. The genome span the range from
~0.58 Mb (the parasite Nanoarchaeum equitans) to ~5.8
Mb (the mesophilic euryarchaeon Methanosarcina acetivorum); there are 20 hyperthermophiles and 21 mesophiles
and moderate thermophiles; 27 genomes represent the
Euryrchaeota, 13 belong to the Crenarchaeota, and the
remaining one is N. equitans whose taxonomic position is
considered uncertain [30,31].

The archaeal COGs (arCOGs) were constructed using a
new computational pipeline (Fig. 1) which is a substantial
modification of the previously published procedures
[11,13]. Briefly, the pipeline consists of the initial step of
the all-against-all comparison of the protein sequences
encoded in the analyzed genomes; preliminary clustering
to identify lineage-specific expansions (LSEs) of paralogs,
genes that are inferred to have evolved by duplication
after the divergence of the compared species; delineation
of clusters of bidirectional best hits to form initial, crude
COGs; iterative search of the rest of the archaeal protein
databases to accrue potential diverged members of the
COGs; minimum linkage clustering of the COGs; merge
of related COGs with supplementary phyletic patterns to
avoid oversplitting of fast evolving COGs; splitting of
potentially overclumped COGs; the details of each of
these procedures are given under Materials and Methods.
Coverage of archaeal genomes with arCOGs
Altogether, the process of arCOGs construction started
with 91,951 proteins encoded in 41 archaeal genomes
and ended with 80,963 of these proteins being included
in 7,538 arCOGs (the arCOGs and accompanying materials are available online [32]). The fraction of the proteins
encoded in a genome that belong to the COGs is a crucial
number in the comparative-genomic analysis as it characterizes both the level of conservation and coherence
between the analyzed genomes, and the potential for
genome annotation by inference from homology. Already
in the early COG analyses, with a small number of
genomes included, it has been noticed that a substantial
majority of the genes had orthologs in other genomes
[12]. With the growth of the genome collection and the
new, refined procedure for COG construction, the coverage of archaeal genomes further increased. Figure 2 shows
that, on average, the arCOGs described here cover 88% of
the genes in an archaeal genome as compared to 76% with

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/33

the previous release of COGs which included 69 genomes,
among these, 13 archaea (for this comparison, the proteins from the 41 analyzed archaeal genomes were fit into
the old COGs using the COGNITOR program). Predictably, the extra coverage was most pronounced for genomes
that had close relatives within the analyzed set such as
Halobacteria, Pyrobaculi, and Methanosarcina, but a substantial increase was seen across the entire set of genomes,
with two notable exceptions, Nanoarchaeum equitans and,
particularly, Cenarchaeum symbiosum (Fig. 2). In the case of
C. symbiosum, somewhat paradoxically, the coverage with
the old COGs was even somewhat greater than with the
new arCOGs (Fig. 2). The reasons behind the poor coverage of these two genomes are clear. Both N. equitans and
C. symbiosum have no close relatives in the current collection of archaeal genomes; in addition, N. equitans appears
to be a very fast-evolving lineage [31] whereas C. symbiosum is a symbiotic crenarchaeon that seems to have
acquired lots of bacterial genes and possesses a number of
unique gene families [33], which leads to a poor representation in ar COGs (see also below). In addition to the
increased coverage, the new arCOGs appear to provide a
better resolution of orthologous relationships than the
existing COG set: 719 of the old COGs [13] were split into
two or more arCOGs, and the mean number of genes
from an archaeal genome per COG (species-specific paralogs) dropped from 1.65 in the COGs (36% clusters with
no paralogs) to 1.34 in arCOGs (58% clusters with no
paralogs).
Phyletic patterns, conserved cores and variable shells of
archaeal genomes
In an early comparative-genomic study of the archaea, we
developed the notion of a conserved core of genes that are
shared by all or the substantial majority of the genomes
and, by inference, are likely to be essential for the cell
function, as opposed to the variable "shell" of genes that
show diverse distributions among species and, accordingly, appear to be subject to lineage-specific gene loss
and horizontal gene transfer (HGT) [27]. The current
analysis of a much larger collection of archaeal genomes
provides for a refinement of these concepts. Figure 3
shows the distribution of the number of archaeal species
in the arCOGs. Obviously, in quantitative terms, arCOGs
with a small number of species (<6) dominate the collection; the distribution is, essentially, an exponential decay
curve, with a rise at the left end (40 or 41 species), which
corresponds to the archaeal genomic core (see below),
and a bump at 15 species which correspond to the 15
available genomes of methanogens. More formally,
assuming that the distribution is described by an exponent(s), the best approximation is achieved with a sum of
three exponential functions (Fig. 3). The first exponent
can be construed to represent the conserved gene core
(~230 arCOGs), the second one describes the "shell" of

The notion of a phyletic pattern which is, simply, the pattern of presence-absence of a COG in the analyzed set of
a species, has been developed in the original COG study
[11]and, independently, by others [34]. Subsequently,
phyletic patterns have been extensively employed both for
functional prediction and as starting material for evolutionary reconstruction (e.g. [7,8,35-38]). Figure 4 shows
the distribution of the phyletic patterns in the new set of
arCOGs. The decay of the curve is remarkably steep, i.e., a
substantial majority of the patterns (2654 of 3192) are
unique, that is, represented by one arCOG only. Examination of the list of the top 10 widespread arCOGs is particularly instructive (Table 2). In this list, 9 patterns are

straightforward. The uniqueness of most of the phyletic
patterns suggests that emergence of new families in individual lineages, lineage-specific gene loss, and HGT are all
major forces of archaeal evolution. However, the absence
of common non-trivial patterns suggests that distinct
"highways" of HGT [39]do not shape archaeal evolution.
The 166 arCOGs that comprise the strictly defined core of
the archaeal genomes, as well as the core gene sets of Euryarchaeota and Crenarchaeota, are, for obvious reasons,
of special interest. First, it has to be noticed that the euryarchaeal core (282 arCOGs) and the crenarchaeal core
(336 arCOGs) are not dramatically larger than the panarchaeal core, emphasizing the high prevalence of gene
loss and gain (on many occasions, via HGT) during the
evolution of archaeal genomes. Along the same lines, but
more unexpectedly, the euryarchaeal and crenarchaeal
genomic signatures, i.e., the sets of arCOGs that are represented in all species in one group but not found in any
species of the other group, consist of only one and three
arCOGs, respectively. In agreement with previous observations, a breakdown of the functional assignments
(according to the broad functional categories associated
with the COGs [13]) reveals dramatic differences between
the overall set of arCOGs and the core sets (Fig. 5).
Indeed, each of the core sets is dominated by proteins
functioning in the translation system, ribosome biogen-

esis, and tRNA modification, with additional significant
contributions from other information-processing systems
(basal transcription and replication). Moreover, even for
the few core archaeal genes that remain experimentally
uncharacterized, roles in translation and RNA modification could be predicted on the basis of the analysis of
domain organization and operonic context (see [32]; KSM
and EVK, unpublished). In a stark contrast, in the overall
arCOG set, the informational functions are quantitatively
minor whereas metabolic functions are dominant (Fig. 5).
Applications of arCOGs for evolutionary genomics of
archaea: gene-content tree, evolutionary reconstructions,
and putative phylogenetic of core and shell genes
From the inception of the COG methodology, it had been
realized that COGs have potential for straightforward evolutionary-genomic applications. One of these is the construction of gene-content trees whereby the phyletic
patterns of COGs are converted into a distance matrix
between the analyzed genomes, with an appropriate normalization for genome size [37,38,40](see Materials and
Methods).

We used the phyletic patterns of the arCOGs as the input
to produce a gene-content tree for the 41 analyzed
archaeal species. Gene-content trees are known to reflect

combination of bona fide phylogenetic relationships,
horizontal gene flows, and life style differences between
organisms leading to parallel gene loss. It appears that the
archaeal gene-content tree carries a substantial phylogenetic signal (Fig. 6). The tree supports the major phylogenetic divisions within the archaea, i.e., the monophyly of
Euryarchaeota and Crenarchaeota, and most of the
branches within each of these divisions. However, at least
three aspects of this tree deserve special attention. Firstly,
the tree has methanogens as a clade within the Euryarchaeota. Regular, sequence-based phylogenetic analyses
tend to break the methanogens into two or three clades,
namely,
methanococcales-methanothermobacteriales,
methanosarcinales (typically, joined with halobacteriales), and Methanopyrus kandleri. The phylogenetic position of M. kandleri remains uncertain although
monophyly with Methanococcales and Methanobacteriales is
likely [41,42], the placement of Methanosarcinales apart
from the rest of the methanogens appears to be solidly
supported [42]. Most likely, the aggregation of the methanogens in the gene-content tree in Fig. 6 is caused by the
shared genes encoding proteins involved in methanogenesis which might have spread both vertically and horizontally. Secondly, N. equitans is placed deeply within the
Thermococcales branch. The initial phylogenetic analysis
has been interpreted to indicate that this unusual organ-

ism was a basal, ancestral archaeal branch [30]. However,
a subsequent reappraisal suggested that the basal position
of N. equitans was a long branch attraction artifact, and the
correct placement of N. equitans should be with the Thermococcales [31]; remarkably, the tree content analysis is
best compatible with this hypothesis. Thirdly, the single
available genome of a mesophilic crenarchaeon, C. symbiosum, falls within the euryarchaeal part of the tree; the
definitive resolution of the phylogenetics affinities of
mesophilic Crenarchaeota requires a representative collection of genomes but the present observations already
indicate that C. symbiosum is not a typical crenarchaeon. At
least, in part, this position of C. symbiosum in the genecontent tree could be explained by acquisition of euryarchaeal genes via HGT [43].
We then addressed the reverse problem, namely, reconstruction of the history of gene gain and loss in archaea
given a particular phylogenetic tree topology. On the
account of the uncertainty of the deep branches in
archaeal phylogeny, we chose to use a partially unresolved
tree in which the relationship between several clades is
presented as a multifurcation (Fig. 7). The reconstruction
was, then, performed using a modification of the
weighted parsimony method [7] that has been previously
applied to the analysis of the evolution of several major
groups of bacteria [15,25,26]. With all the caveats in
mind, the results of this reconstruction reveal notable
trends of gene gain and loss in different lineages of

archaea as well as features of the inferred ancestral forms.
Predictably, the most massive gene loss is seen in N. equitans (a parasite with the smallest known genome among
archaea), closely followed by Thermoplasmales (another
group of heterotrophic archaea with small genomes) and
C. symbiosum (a symbiotic archaeon that might have
undergone a major life style shift). The lineages with the
most gene gain include those with the largest genomes,
namely, Halobacteriales and Methanosarcinales, and Sulfolobales-Desulfurococcales. More unexpectedly, substantial
gene gain, along with major gene loss, was inferred also
for Thermococcales and Thermoplasmales; apparently, these
are groups with highly dynamic genomes.
The present reconstruction maps almost 1000 archaeal
genes to LACA and ~1300 and ~1400 genes to the ancestors of Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota, respectively
(Fig. 7). These numbers are notable in that the ancestral
gene sets appear to be not much smaller than the smallest
genomes of the extant free-living archaea, such as Thermoplasma (Figs. 7 and 8). It must be kept in mind that these
numbers are low bounds for the gene content of the
ancestral forms inasmuch as parsimony has a fundamental bias toward underestimating the amount of gene loss
[44]. Thus, perhaps, unexpectedly, it appears that ancestral forms, including LACA, were not much simpler, at
least in terms of genomic complexity but, most likely, also
in their cellular organization than some modern forms.
This conjecture is further supported by a more detailed

examination of the genes (arCOGs) assigned to LACA
(Table 3). In particular, the results of the reconstruction
suggest that LACA was a hyperthermophile that possessed
reverse gyrase, the principal hallmark of the hyperthermophilic lifestyle [45] and most of the other genes characteristic of hyperthermophiles ([36] and unpublished
observations), and a chemoautotroph that had the genes
to support membrane-based redox bioenergetics and all
central biosyntheses (Table 3). Notably, the reconstruction also indicates that LACA already possessed some
widespread functional systems of archaea that are not normally thought of as being ancestral including the CASS
system of antiviral defense [46,47] and the predicted
toxin-antitoxin system centered around the "minimal"
nucleotidyltransferases ([48] and KSM, YIW, and EVK,
unpublished).

Finally, we attempted to obtain a crude breakdown of the
phylogenetic affinities of the arCOGs, in particular, those
that form the archaeal gene core (see above) and those
that were assigned to LACA. Because a comprehensive
phylogenomic analysis is beyond the scope of this paper
(and has major potential for its own share of artifacts),
this was done by analyzing the taxonomic breakdown of
the proteins that are most similar to the representatives of
a given arCOG as detected in BLAST searches. In order to
eliminate potential effects of HGT, a special protocol was
developed to identify coherent affinities, e.g., a bacterial
affinity was assigned only when the proteins from a given
arCOG had best hits in multiple bacterial species (see
Materials and Methods). We are fully aware of the limitations of such methodology that, at best, gives a crude
approximation of the true phylogeny [49] but we also
note that this type of analysis can reveal highly meaning-

Figure 8 reconstructions for ancestral archaeal forms: genomes close in size to modern hyperthermophiles
Low-bound
Low-bound reconstructions for ancestral archaeal forms: genomes close in size to modern hyperthermophiles. Each column
shows the total number of annotated protein-coding genes in the respective archaeal species; the colored portions (green for
Crenarchaeota, blue for Euryarchaeota, and cyan for Nanoarchaeota) show genes included in arCOGs. The hatched columns
show the number of arCOGs assigned to LACA, the Last CrenArchaeal Common Ancestor (LCACA) and the Last EuryArchaeal Common Ancestor (LEACA).

Comparing these observations with those presented in
Figs. 3 and 5, one comes to the conclusion that, quantitatively, archaeal genomes are dominated by the relatively
mobile "shell" genes that belong to the common prokaryotic gene pool and encode the overwhelming majority of
metabolic, structural, and signal transduction functions; a
sharp contrast is presented by the stable, archaeo-eukaryotic core of information-processing genes. These quantitative conclusions, even if based on a crude analysis, are in
a good agreement with the early observations on the
bimodal distribution of the taxonomic affinities of
archaeal genes [52], the subsequent observations on the
affinities of eukaryotic genes [51,53], and the complexity
hypothesis which posited distinct evolutionary fates of
information and operational genes [54].

Conclusion
The arCOGs, which are expected to be updated as genome
sequencing progresses, are a resource for genome annotation of the newly sequenced archaeal genomes and the
refinement of the existing annotations, as well as evolutionary reconstructions. Crude reconstructions presented
here indicate that the ancestral archaeal forms, including
LACA, probably, were full-fledged prokaryotes, of approximately the same level of complexity as the simplest of the
modern free-living archaea.

from the RefSeq section of GenBank (Caldivirga maquilingensis IC-167, Cenarchaeum symbiosum and Uncultured
methanogenic archaeon). Protein sequences of Thermoproteus tenax were kindly provided by Bettina Siebers with
permission from the sequencing consortium. The procedure of COG construction involved the following steps.
1. All-against-all BLAST [56] search was used to establish
the similarity relationships between the archaeal proteins.
Lineage-specific expansions of paralogs were identified
essentially as described previously [57,58]. Initial clusters
based on triangles of symmetrical best hits were constructed using a modified COG algorithm [11,13]; the
major difference in the current implementation was the
strict symmetry requirement for the "best hit" relationship
between proteins. This constraint lowers the number of
false-positives but, in the presence of paralogs, leads to
substantial underclustering [11]; this was rectified on the
subsequent steps.

2. Multiple alignments of the initial cluster members were
constructed using the MUSCLE program [59]; alignments
were used to construct PSSMs for a PSI-BLAST search [56]
against the database of Archaea proteins with the e-value
threshold of 0.01; proteins (domains) were added to the
corresponding best-scoring original clusters resulting in a
set of expanded clusters.
3. Sequences of expanded cluster members were aligned
using MUSCLE, and the PSSMs constructed from these
alignment were used for a second round of PSI-BLAST
search against the database of archaeal proteins. The
search results were used to construct a similarity graph for
the relationships between the expanded clusters. Formally, all statistically significant (e<0.01) hits in a search
with the PSSM for a particular cluster were classified
according to the cluster they belong to; clusters in the hit
list were ranked according to the mean score across their
members (members missing from the hit list were
assigned an arbitrary score 2 bits below the significance
threshold). An edge between the i-th and the j-th clusters

Page 13 of 20
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2007, 2:33

was given weight equal to the lowest rank among the iâj
and jâi relationships (i.e., if cluster j is the top-ranking hit
when cluster i is the query but cluster i is the third-ranking
hit for cluster j, then the edge connecting i and j is given
the rank of 3). Connected components were extracted
from the graph; pairs of nodes within a connected component were assigned an edge with a rank of infinity if they
were not connected directly. A minimum-linkage clustering procedure was applied to the connected sets of clusters
(if cluster i and j are merged, the edge between cluster k
and the node, representing the merged clusters, is given
the rank equal to the lowest rank of k-i and k-j edges),
resulting in a rooted dendrogram of relationships
between the clusters. Then each node on on the tree was
labeled with the number of species that were present in all
descendant clusters. Two rules were used to determine if
the descendant clusters should be merged: i) if speciescoverage of the node is at least 50% greater than that of
any of the descendant nodes and ii) if, among the
descendants of a node, one is species-rich and the other
one is species-poor (formally, if si>20sj/(10-sj) where si
and sj stand for the species-coverage of the species-rich
and species-poor descendant nodes, respectively).
4. In parallel to the above procedures, a BLAST search
against the COG 2003 database was performed, followed
by using a modified COGNITOR program [11,13] to
assign archaeal proteins to prokaryotic COGs. Merged
clusters with proteins assigned to different COGs were
split into COG-specific clusters to avoid clustering of paralogous proteins that previously have been assigned to
different curated COGs.
Reconstruction of gene gain and loss events during the
evolution of Archaea
Reconstruction of gene gain and loss during the evolution
of Archaea was performed using a modified weighted parsimony approach [7] implemented in a two-pass algorithm. First, a coarse-resolution multifurcating species tree
was compiled from several single-gene phylogenetic
reconstructions and taxonomic data. For each arCOG, the
phyletic pattern indicating the presense/absence of the
respective gene in each analyzed species was mapped onto
the leaves of the tree. The first pass is performed in the
leaves-to-root direction, and the number of descendant
nodes containing the given gene is counted for each internal tree node. If this number is greater than or equal to the
first (generally, more stringent) threshold, which is set for
each node individually, the node is assigned state "1"
(presence of the gene), otherwise it is assigned state "0"
(absence of the gene). In the second pass, which is performed in the opposite, root-to-leaves direction, if the
gene is absent in the given node (state "0") but present in
its ancestor and the number of descendant nodes carrying
this gene is greater than or equal to the second (generally

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/33

more relaxed) threshold, the node is assigned state "1".
For the guide tree and the thresholds, see [32].

Reviewers' reports
Reviewer 1: Peer Bork, European Molecular Biology
Laboratory
The paper describes the construction of orthologous
group for archea.

Given the success of the COGs and KOGs (a subset for
eukaryotes with higher resolution) and the inability of
current purely automatic procedures to produce reliable
orthologus groups and, very importantly, their reliable
functional annotation, I see this as an important resource
for various studies. Furthermore, it uses a semi-automatic
procedure that includes some clever guiding principles
e.g. it takes into account phylogenetic gene presence patterns. The average coverage of 88% at a higher resolution
than the current 76% COG coverage of genes in archeal
genomes is another noteworthy and useful feature. As far
as I can see, the arCOGs are of high quality and I look forward to use them.
There is no comparison to more recent orthology-built
procedures, but I assume that this semi-automatic procedure presented here provides a more accurate picture than
purely automatic methods.
The only concerns I have are availability/formate issues
and some minimalistic Figure captions. Both should be
easy to solve.
Taken together, I congratulate the authors for this nice,
important and very useful piece of work.
Authors' response:The formats of the files on the ftp site were
modified to increase transparency, and an extended README
file was added. We hope this imporves accessibility which is,
indeed, crucial. The figure captions were amended.
Reviewer 2: Patrick Forterre, Institut Pasteur and
UniversitÃ© Paris-Sud
The Â«easy to useÂ» COG database has been especially useful
for the biological community. It has helped to improve
the quality of genome annotation and has been widely
adopted by non bioinformatic experts to perform preliminary rounds of comparative genomic analysis. The main
problem with such popular database is the delay in their
updating, a daunting task considering the current avalanche of completely sequenced genomes. The present
paper by Kira Makarova and colleagues reports a much
welcome update of the COG database that focus on
archaea (arCOGs). The number of completely sequenced
archaeal genomes remains quite low (compared to the situation with bacteria) allowing an exhaustive analysis that

Page 14 of 20

Biology Direct 2007, 2:33

remains to be done for bacteria and eukarya. The arCOGs
database will be for sure an extremely important source of
information for the community working on archaea and
for all scientists interested in comparative genomics and
microbial evolution. The new analysis corresponds to a
substantial increase in information compared to previous
one, since around 40% of arCOGs are new.
In addition to the description of the arCOGs database, the
paper by Kira Makarova and co-workers present several
analyses that bring new (or update) data and raise several
interesting evolutionary questions. In particular, they
have built a gene-content tree based on the presenceabsence of arCOGs in archaeal genome and estimated the
evolution of the archaeal genome content along the evolutionary tree based on a gene loss and gain analysis. They
reported several intriguing observations that are worth to
be discussed in the framework of current debates on
archaeal phylogeny and on the nature of the last universal
archaeal ancestor.
Makarova and co-workers noticed that the number of
strictly specific euryarchaeal and crenarchaeal proteins is
very low (one and three, respectively). This seems to
strongly argue in favour of the monophyly of Archaea
(against the Â«eocyteÂ» hypothesis). However, it should be
interesting to present a slightly Â«relaxedÂ» version of these
cores, by allowing for the possibility for a protein to be
missing in a group of related archaea (something quite
frequently observed, for instance the lack of the euryarchaeal histone in Thermoplasmatales). More generally, it
could be interesting in the future to define a category of
conserved arCOGs (carCOGs?) present in all members of
at least two archaeal orders in order to discriminate
between ORFans arCOGs that are only present in one
order (probably Â«recentlyÂ» introduced by lateral gene
transfer) and arCOGs of probable ancient origin that can
tell us something about the evolutionary relationships
between the diverse archaeal orders. It should be then
interesting to determine if the distribution of such carCOGs correlate with the archaeal phylogeny based on various evolutionary markers.
The parasitic archaeon Nanoarchaeum equitans lacks the
larger number (50) of universal arCOG, confirming that
this archaeon probably evolved by Â«genome reductionÂ».
Some authors have suggested that N. equitans is a primitive organism. I suspect that there is a relatively high percentage of these 50 proteins that have homologues in
Bacteria or Eukarya. This could be indicated as an argument in favour of the reduction scenario versus the "old
nano" hypothesis! Interestingly, the gene content tree
based on arCOGs groups N. equitans with Thermococcales
among Euryarchaeota. Although gene-content trees can be
sometimes highly biased by lateral gene transfer, this

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/33

observation is in good agreement with a preliminary global analysis based on best BLAST-hits and refined phylogenies based on proteins of the small ribosomal subunits,
reverse gyrase, Topo VI and elongation factors (Brochier et
al.2005). This confirms that N. equitans should not be
considered as a member of a new archaeal phylum (as
already widely found in text-books!!) but as an odd member of the Euryarchaeota, probably, distantly related to
Thermococcales.
Another puzzling observation is the grouping of Cenarchaeum symbiosum with euryarchaea in the gene-content
tree. Interestingly, the COG coverage is quite similar for
all archaeal genomes (around 88%) except for C. symbiosum and N. equitans. This can be explained by genome
reduction in the case of N. equitans, but not in the case of
C. symbiosum whose genome has a Â«normalÂ» size. Significantly, the authors reported that the coverage of C. symbiosum genome with the old COGs was greater than with the
new arCOGs! This indicates that this genome contains
COGs present in Bacteria or Saccharomyces cerevisiae but
not in any other archaeon. The proposed explanation is
that C. symbiosum is a symbiotic crenarchaeon that has
acquired lots of bacterial genes. An alternative hypothesis
is that C. symbiosum is not a crenarchaeon after all, but represents an early branching archaeal phylum that contains
bacterial and archaeal homologues that have been lost in
other archaea.
From their reconstruction of gene loss and gain events,
Makarova and co-workers suggest that the last Universal
archaeal ancestor (LACA) was a hyperthermophile and a
chemo-litoautotrophe with a minimal number of genes
around 1000. They conclude that LACA might have been
(nearly) as advanced as modern archaeal hyperthermophiles and found this conclusion quite Â«unexpectedÂ».
I am not so surprised. It's a prejudice to think that ancestors are always simpler than present-day organisms and
that ancient evolution always occurred toward more
"complexity". There is no reason why reductive evolution,
which has occurred so often in the evolution of modern
cells, was not as pervasive in ancient time (Forterre and
Philippe, 1999). In fact, an in-depth analysis of ribosomal
protein distribution by Poch and co-workers already suggested a few years ago that the ribosome of LACA was
probably more complex that the ribosome of any modern
archaea (Lecompte et al., 2002).
Authors' response: We do not, exactly, disagree and certainly
realize the importance of reductive evolution. Still, whether or
not we should consider the reconstruction of a complex LACA
surprising or not, depends on the perspective. Considering that
LACA is supposed to be the common ancestor of one of the 3
domains of life, there might be some element of surprise in this
observation. After all, at the earliest stages of the evolution of

Page 15 of 20

Biology Direct 2007, 2:33

life, there must have been a dramatic increase in complexity.
That this complexification stage, apparently, was over by the
time the domain of life became distinct (very likely, the same
will hold for bacteria) is, certainly, of note. Alternatively, it is
conceivable that LACA is actually not as ancient as one might
think but represents a more recent bottleneck in archaeal evolution such that there was a complexification stage after the onset
of the archaeal domain but it is inaccessible by comparative
genomics.
My only criticism of this paper is that the authors have
taken a quite conservative view of archaeal phylogeny
(only based on 16S rRNA) to analyse gene loss and gain
along the archaeal history and to estimate the genome
content of LUCA. Indeed, several features of their unresolved multifurcation tree are dubious.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/33

resolved trees, and better methods of reconstruction, and we certainly hope to be involved.
Finally, in the discussion of the gene-content tree, the
authors wrote Â«methanogenesis which are spread both vertically and horizontallyÂ». In fact, a detailed phylogenetic analysis of genes involved in methanogenesis by Bapteste and
co-workers has shown that, surprisingly, although these
proteins can be considered as Â«operationalÂ» they have
been only transmitted by vertical inheritance in the
archaeal domain (Bapteste et al., 2005).
Authors' response: We believe that the issue is not quite
resolved yet. The wording in the paper was softened, nevertheless.

Brochier, C. Forterre P. and Gribaldo S.

In all these cases, the authors have chosen to follow the
16S rRNA tree, whereas careful analyses based on ribosomal proteins have shown that Methanopyrus kandleri
most likely groups with methanococcales and methanomicrobiales (Brochier et al. 2004) and that N. equitans is at
least sister-group of euryarchaea (if not of Thermococcales). As previously indicated, the grouping of C. symbiosum
with crenarchaea could be also highly misleading. It
should have been interesting to compare the genome content of LACA based on the 16S rRNA phylogeny and the
more robust phylogeny based on ribosomal proteins. My
feeling is that the nature of LACA (chemo-litoautotroph
or not, hyperthermophile or not?) is still a pending question.

Archaeal phylogeny based on proteins of the transcription
and translation machineries: tackling the Methanopyrus
kandleri paradox

Authors' response: We have not really followed the 16S RNA
tree but rather deliberately chose a poorly resolved topology so
as not to subscribe to any particular phylogenetic hypothesis
with respect to issues that are still considered unresolved. We
are well aware of the published work on archaeal phylogenies
and the two important papers by Brochier et al. are cited. Out
of fairness, the likely position of Methanopyrus with Methanococcales and Methanobacteriales, was first reported in Slesarev
et al. in 2002, and this cited as well. The wording on Methanopyrus in the text was modified to reflect these reports but we
did not modify the tree in Fig. 7. One has to keep in mind that
the reconstruction here is by no means supposed to be the final
word on the scenario of archaeal evolution but more of an exercise showcasing the utility of the arCOGs. We expect that there
will be many more iterations with more genomes, better

Reviewer 3: PurificaciÃ³n LÃ³pez-GarcÃ­a, CNRS, UniversitÃ©

This article describes the analysis of genes present in most
of the currently available archaeal genome sequences in
view of their classification in clusters of orthologous genes
specific to the archaea (arCOG). It represents an updated
extension of previous comparative genomic analyses of
COGs though exclusively devoted to the archaea. As a
consequence, the arCOG database produced is more
refined, resulting in an increased coverage and resolution.
The latter is reflected in the numerical increase of specific
archaeal COGs and the accompanying decrease in the
number of clusters containing paralogs. The comparison
of arCOGs thus defined allows to infer the presence of
~166 core arCOGs, which were likely present in the last
archaeal common ancestor (LACA), while 282 and 336
arCOGs appear ancestral to the euryarchaeotal and crenarchaeotal branches, respectively. From the nature of the
core arCOGs, the authors conclude that the LACA was a
rather complex hyperthermophilic chemoautotroph possessing ~1000 genes. Differential gene gain and loss are
predicted to have occurred in the two major archaeal
branches. The pattern of arCOG distribution in the different archaeal genomes is used to reconstruct a gene-content tree. Despite biases that may be associated to this
approach, which are cautiously recognized by the authors,
the tree obtained is largely congruent with widely
accepted archaeal molecular phylogenies. Interestingly,
Nanoarchaeum equitans is placed within the Thermococcales in agreement with recent detailed phylogenetic analyses, reinforcing the idea that the basal placement of N.
equitans in some trees was due to long-branch attraction
artifacts. The two major differences of this gene-content
tree with respect to previous accepted molecular phylogenies for the archaea are that all methanogenic euryarchaeota, normally split in at least two large groups in
molecular phylogenies, cluster together as they share a
large number of methanogenesis-related genes, and that
Cenarchaeum symbiosum is placed within the Euryarchaota,
in disagreement with its expected position within the Crenarchaeota. Although the type of analyses carried out is
not innovative, the new arCOG database presented here
will certainly be very useful to improve future genome
annotations.

I have only a few minor comments or suggestions, as follows:
-First, it has to be noticed that the euryarchaeal core (282
arCOGs) and the crenarchaeal core (336 arCOGs) are not
dramatically larger than the pan-archaeal core, emphasizing
the general volatility of archaeal genomes.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/33

jective. It is roughly twice the size. How does this compare
with the situation in bacteria? It would be nice to include
this information here, and even better, to relate/normalize this information to the average genetic distance in a
reference conserved genetic marker, such as the 16S rRNA
gene.
Authors' response: "Dramatic", certainly, is in the eye of the
beholder. We believe the reader will see it that way, so no
changes. Comparing to bacteria is dubious because there are no
two major groups of bacteria emulating Euryarchaeota and
Crenarchaeota. Calibration â complex exercise that goes
beyond the scope of this paper.
Defining genome volatility would also be useful. Genome
volatility has been defined in the literature as the mean
volatility of all codons weighted by their frequency within
the genome, codon volatility being a measurement related
to the non-synonymous versus synonymous mutations
(e.g. Dagan and Graur, Mol Biol Evol 2004, 22:496). I
believe the meaning is more informal and vague here, and
also subjective. Can you provide a reference showing that
archaeal genomes are "volatile"?
Authors' response: Good point, we changed the wording to
avoid any wrong connotations, "volatility" is not used anymore.
Horizontal gene transfer from bacteria has apparently
contributed to shape the C. symbiosum genome. In page
14, it is mentioned that C. symbiosum falls within the euryarchaeotal part of the gene-content tree. Would you predict that HGT from euryarchaeota may partly explain this
observation as some (although very limited) environmental genomic studies appear to suggest (Lopez-Garcia, Brochier et al, Environ Microbiol 2004, 6:19?
Authors' response: Yes, a valid point, we included this possibility in the revision and cite the paper.
