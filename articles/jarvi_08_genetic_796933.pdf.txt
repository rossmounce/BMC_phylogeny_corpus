Abstract
Background: The relatively recent introduction of a highly efficient mosquito vector and an avian pathogen
(Plasmodium relictum) to an isolated island ecosystem with naïve, highly susceptible avian hosts provides a unique
opportunity to investigate evolution of virulence in a natural system. Mixed infections can significantly contribute
to the uncertainty in host-pathogen dynamics with direct impacts on virulence. Toward further understanding of
how host-parasite and parasite-parasite relationships may impact virulence, this study characterizes within-host
diversity of malaria parasite populations based on genetic analysis of the trap (thrombospondin-related
anonymous protein) gene in isolates originating from Hawaii, Maui and Kauai Islands.
Methods: A total of 397 clones were produced by nested PCR amplification and cloning of a 1664 bp fragment
of the trap gene from two malarial isolates, K1 (Kauai) and KV115 (Hawaii) that have been used for experimental
studies, and from additional isolates from wild birds on Kauai, Maui and Hawaii Islands. Diversity of clones was
evaluated initially by RFLP-based screening, followed by complete sequencing of 33 selected clones.
Results: RFLP analysis of trap revealed a minimum of 28 distinct RFLP haplotypes among the 397 clones from 18
birds. Multiple trap haplotypes were detected in every bird evaluated, with an average of 5.9 haplotypes per bird.
Overall diversity did not differ between the experimental isolates, however, a greater number of unique
haplotypes were detected in K1 than in KV115. We detected high levels of clonal diversity with clear delineation
between isolates K1 and KV115 in a haplotype network. The patterns of within-host haplotype clustering are
consistent with the possibility of a clonal genetic structure and rapid within-host mutation after infection.
Conclusion: Avian malaria (P. relictum) and Avipoxvirus are the significant infectious diseases currently affecting
the native Hawaiian avifauna. This study shows that clonal diversity of Hawaiian isolates of P. relictum is much
higher than previously recognized. Mixed infections can significantly contribute to the uncertainty in hostpathogen dynamics with direct implications for host demographics, disease management strategies, and evolution
of virulence. The results of this study indicate a widespread presence of multiple-genotype malaria infections with
high clonal diversity in native birds of Hawaii, which when coupled with concurrent infection with Avipoxvirus, may
significantly influence evolution of virulence.

Background
Malarial infections consisting of mixed genotypes of the
same species can be extremely common in human hosts,
constituting over 80% of infections in high-transmission
areas [1-3]. In rodent malarial infections, transmission
rates of individual genotypes of Plasmodium chaubaudi are
often higher from mixed infections than from single clone
infections [4] and genetically distinct malaria clones compete within hosts [3]. Experiments with clonal lineages of
P. chaubaudi have demonstrated that more virulent lines
compete more successfully and that within-host selection
can promote the evolution of virulence in malaria populations [5,6].
The trap gene encodes a cell-surface protein present in
sporozoites and erythrocytic stage malaria parasites and
was first described by Robson et al. [7]. The TRAP protein
is critical for gliding motility (a unique behavior of apicomplexans that results in locomotion with no change in
cell shape) and subsequent host cell invasion [7]. TRAPdeficient Plasmodium mutants are unable to invade either
mosquito salivary glands or mammalian host hepatocytes
[8]. The trap gene is a single-copy gene localized to chromosome 13 in P. falciparum based on hybridization of a
trap probe to pulse-field gradient separations of intact
chromosomal DNA molecules [9]. Trap paralogs have
been identified in all motile Plasmodium life stages [1012]. Trap orthologs have been found in many species
within the phylum Apicomplexa including Eimeria tenella
(EPT100) [13], Cryptosporidium parvum (TRAP-C1) [14],
and Toxoplasma gondii (MIC2) [15]. Particular regions of
the trap gene are critical for successful invasion [16] and
survival [17]. Partial trap genes have been isolated from
species of Plasmodium from avian hosts in Hawaii [18] and
American Samoa [19]. This present study further characterizes diversity of the trap gene in isolates from avian
hosts originating from three Hawaiian islands. Two isolates that were used in prior experimental infections were
additionally characterized to begin to evaluate potential
host effects on parasite diversity. We document the presence of multiple trap haplotypes of P. relictum within individual hosts, and define specific regions of interest within
the trap gene for further population-level molecular studies.

Results
Nested PCR was used to amplify a 1664 bp fragment from
the trap gene from 18 malaria-infected birds originating
from Hawaii, Kauai and Maui. All PCR products were subsequently cloned prior to analyses. These 18 birds
included six Hawaii 'Amakihi (Hemignathus virens) which
were experimentally infected with isolate K1 (originating
from Kauai), five Hawaii 'Amakihi experimentally
infected with isolate KV115 (originating from Hawaii)
[20] and seven wild-infected birds of four species, 'Amak-

ihi, I'iwi (Vesteria coccinea), 'Apapane (Himatione sanguinea) and 'Elepaio (Chasiempis sandwichensis), which
originate from 3 islands (Hawaii, Kauai and Maui).
Nested PCR was carried out using one of two enzyme/
buffer systems. A total of 397 clones were obtained (Table
1). Of these, 357 trap clones were obtained using Taq
polymerase (Promega) and 40 trap clones were obtained
using FastStart High Fidelity PCR System (Roche). Also,
118 trap clones were obtained using standard PCR methods and 279 clones obtained using PCR+1 methods [21].
Additional details regarding the birds involved in this
study, infection isolate and methodologies applied to produce clones are summarized in Table 1.
RFLP Analysis
Amplified products from 397 trap gene clones were subjected to RFLP analysis using three enzymes (EcoRI, HpaII,
and TaqαI) and were analyzed by either agarose or acrylamide gel electrophoresis. A total of 88 distinct RFLP patterns (haplotypes) were detected, of which 28 distinct
haplotypes were found among clones originating from
multiple birds. Because these 28 distinct haplotypes were
found independently in two or more birds, they are
referred to as being "confirmed" trap haplotypes and represent the minimum number of haplotypes that are likely
present in these infected birds (Table 2). One predominant RFLP haplotype (77) was found in all birds, and
comprised 72% of all clones. Subsequent SSCP analysis of
several clones with this predominant RFLP pattern
revealed multiple additional banding patterns indicating
further diversity among these RFLP-defined haplotype 77
clones (data not shown). Clone data from birds 15 and 18
were removed from further numerical summation due to
minimal data collection with only 2 clones and 1 clone,
respectively, obtained from these birds. In the 16 remaining birds, the minimum number of distinct trap haplotypes per bird ranged from 3 to 10, with an average of 5.9
haplotypes per bird. The average frequency of haplotype
77 was 0.63, but ranged from 0.17 in a wild 'Elepaio from
Kauai to 0.80 in an 'Amakihi from Hawaii. We estimated
diversity using the Simpson's index of diversity (D) [22]
and the Shannon-Wiener index (H) [reviewed in [23]],
and results are shown in Table 2. Diversity estimates by
both indices produced parallel values and ranged from D
= 1.49–6 and H = 0.69–1.79. These (generally) low parasite diversity values estimated in most individual hosts
reflect the unequal abundances of haplotypes detected.
One exception is 'Elepaio 17 from Kauai with D = 6, in
which each haplotype was detected equally. Since the
total number of distinct haplotypes detected is an indicator of within-host parasite variability and is likely dependent on the number of clones evaluated, we include the
number of haplotypes/total clones ratio (hap/clones) as
an additional reference indicator of variability. The hap/
clone ratio varies among hosts ranging from 0.15 (in

*Details regarding the clones include total number produced, number of confirmed (detected in > 1 bird) variants and clones, as well as the number
of clones sequenced. Blood was collected from experimentally-infected birds that survived infection between days 69–89 post-infection (PI) when
parasitemias had reached chronic levels. Pectoral muscle was collected from experimentally-infected birds that succumbed to infection between days
16–26 PI when acute phase parasitemias were high.

To examine the possible effects of PCR enzyme fidelity or
specificity we performed side by side amplifications with
35 total cycles in two 'Amakihi (6 and 11) experimentally
infected with isolates K1 and KV115, respectively, using
standard Taq polymerase (Promega) and the FastStart
High Fidelity PCR System (Roche) (Table 4). In both
'Amakihi 6 (isolate K1) and 'Amakihi 11 (isolate KV115),
we observed diversity estimates greater (by all indices)
among clones amplified with Promega Taq than in clones
produced using the Roche system when other variables
(35 cycles, PCR +1 methods) are held constant (Table 4,
Trial 3 vs. Trial 4). In fact, the haplotype/clone ratio was
reduced by 50% in both birds using the Roche enzyme
system. We investigated the effect of cycle number on
diversity by comparing 80 cycles vs. 35 cycles while holding other variables (Taq Promega polymerase, and PCR+1
methodology) constant (Trial 2 vs Trial 3). In both birds,
we observed diversity values lower among clones generated with 35 cycles than among those generated by 80
cycles (by all indices). We also compared PCR + 1 amplification methods [21,25] with standard amplification and
cloning methods in these two birds (Trial 1 vs. Trial 2). We
observed greater diversity estimates of clones generated
using PCR+1 methods as compared with those generated
using standard methodology based on the Simpson's and
Shannon-Wiener indices, but not the haplotype/clone
ratio. Statistical analysis was not completed for any of
these estimates in Table 4 due to low sample sizes (n = 2
birds) and are reported simply as empirical observations.
Sequence Analysis
Sequence information was obtained across the entire trap
fragment (1624 bp, not including primer sequences) from
33 clones originating from 12 individuals (Table 1) and
assigned Genbank nos. (EU760855-EU760887). Eighteen
clones of the RFLP "dominant" haplotype 77 and fifteen
clones representing 12 different haplotypes were
sequenced. Two clones each were sequenced representing
RFLP haplotype 12, and three clones of haplotype 59.

All sequences appeared highly similar to previously
obtained Plasmodium relictum trap sequences [18,19].
Average nucleotide composition is 26% T, 16% C, 41% A,

0.005(0.001), and of those from the KV115 isolate (n = 16

(0.002).
A schematic of the trap gene of P. relictum is presented in
Figure 2. These trap sequences are composed of functional
domains similar to those previously described in other
Plasmodium species [26,27] and in P. relictum [18,19]. The
amino acid sequence corresponds to amino acids 56–533
of the P. falciparum clone T9/96 sequence [9]. An alignment file (Additional File 1) of the amino acid sequences
(543 amino acids) is provided, and the nucleotide alignment file is available upon request. The core of Region II
(which is also found in many other proteins) is WTPCSVTCG, which differs by one amino acid from that of other
species of Plasmodium including P. falciparum [9] and P.
gallinaceum [27] (WSPCSVTCG). The repeat region consists of 9 highly conserved repeats of 12 or 13 amino acids
followed by a region of semi-conserved repeats between
the repeat region and transmembrane region in Figures 2,
and 3. The amino acid sequences (frequency) of repeats
are as follows with the most highly conserved sites underlined and the cell-recognition signal RGD [9] conserved in

Nucleotide polymorphism is localized to particular
regions of the gene. The partial A-domain (Mg binding),
the sufatide binding region (II), and the transmembrane
regions are 100% conserved among all sequences. The
transmembrane region is identical to that of P. gallinaceum
trap, but differs from that of P. falciparum clone T9/96 by
3/19 amino acids. The 18 amino acids available from the
cytoplasmic tail are highly conserved. Interestingly, the
cytoplasmic tails are 100% identical in all sequences from
non-survivors, but four of the five sequences from survivors have single amino acid changes (three of the four
sequences from survivor 'Amakihi 9 (736) and one
sequence from 'Amakihi 2(1145)). The sequence is terminated prior to inclusion of the clustered acidic residues
shown to be important for aldolase binding [17].
Diversity across the entire sequence includes a total of 143
polymorphic nucleotide sites resulting in 87 amino acid
changes. Deletions are detected at two sites in the 5'
region (amino acids 124 and 130) and at one site in the
repeat region (amino acid 170). The 13 polymorphic
amino acid sites occurring in two or more sequences are
of particular interest. Of these, five sites are dimorphic,

sequences from 'Amakihi 6 have proline at this site.
The 33 sequences are presented in Figure 3 as a phylogenetic network [TCS,[28]]. The TCS software collapses
sequences into haplotypes and calculates their frequencies. These frequencies are used to estimate haplotype outgroup probabilities, which correlate with haplotype age
[28]. Ancestral haplotypes are identified by the internal
positioning (shown boxed in Figure 3), and determined
by degree of commonness and number of lineages derived
from them [29]. Tip clades connected by only one connecting branch to the rest of the network are considered as
derived. Based on these 33 input sequences, the ancestral
haplotype is identified as originating from K1 (Kauai) isolate from 'Amakihi 6 and is represented by sequences
6.165 and 6.182. Three single step haplotypes or clades
are derived from this ancestral haplotype, one of which
(represented by sequences 11.175 and 11.172) forms a
clade with most all other sequences from Hawaii (isolates
KV115, and 4 wild Hawaii isolates). All other haplotypes
involve multiple mutational differences (indicated by circular connections) with a maximum of 17. Within host
diversity appears high with a total of nine haplotypes represented by 10 sequences from 'Amakihi 6 infected with
isolate K1. Among birds infected with isolate KV115,
seven haplotypes were represented by 10 sequences from
'Amakihi 11 and four haplotypes were represented by four
sequences from 'Amakihi 9. The G/C polymorphism at
nucleotide 1289 appears very influential in the network
estimation as all haplotypes on the left side of Figure 3
have a C at this position and all those on the right side
have a G in this position. Those on the left side consist of
haplotypes from four 'Amakihi infected with K1 (Kauai),
and one haplotype each from wild isolates from an
Elepaio from Kauai and an I'iwi from Hawaii. Haplotypes
on the right side originate from four 'Amakihi infected
with isolate KV115 (Hawaii), and one haplotype each
from wild isolates from an Elepaio from Kauai and an
'Amakihi from Hawaii.

Discussion
The introduction of the mosquito vector, Culex quinquefasciatus to Hawaii in 1826 [30] provided a means of transmission for two introduced avian pathogens, avian
malaria (Plasmodium relictum) and Avipoxvirus, that likely
reached the islands in the late 19th or early 20th centuries
[31-38]. At least two distinct genetic variants of Avipoxvirus
are present in Hawaii, with one variant appearing more
virulent than the other [38]. Recent studies have identified
only a single lineage of P. relictum in Hawaii [39] previously identified as GRW4 [40] based on partial sequence
data from the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (n = 24
infected native birds) and nuclear DHFR-TS gene (n = 7
infected native birds).
We selected the gene encoding the cell-surface protein
TRAP to target for analysis of within-host diversity of
mixed genotype infections because of the critical role it
plays in parasite locomotion and invasion of both the
mosquito salivary glands and vertebrate host cells [7].
RFLP-based studies of P. falciparum trap clones revealed
high levels of diversity with 96 haplotypes detected
among 337 total clones [41] and sequencing of 73 clones
from P. vivax trap revealed a total of 54 haplotypes [42].
All available information in other species of Plasmodium
indicates that trap is a single-copy gene [9]. The organism
is in the haploid state in the blood stage [reviewed in
[43]], so the number of trap variants detected should be a
strong indicator of the minimum number of geneticallydistinct parasites present in an individual host. Our analysis includes comparison of experimentally-infected hosts
which were exposed to the same parasite populations
(same isolates) via single infective mosquito bites from
mosquitoes originating from an inbred closed colony.
Therefore, the differences in haplotypes detected among
birds are likely reflecting host effects.
Multiple trap RFLP haplotypes were detected in all individuals ranging from two individuals having a minimum
of three haplotypes to one individual having at least 10
distinct haplotypes. It is highly unlikely that this wide
range of haplotype number among different isolates is
due to the presence of multiple pseudogenes or that copy
number differs so drastically in P. relictum. Sequence data
further supports the presence of multiple haplotypes
within individuals with nine distinct sequences representing 10 clones in 'Amakihi 6, seven distinct sequences representing 10 clones in 'Amakihi 11 and four distinct
sequences representing four clones in 'Amakihi 9 (see Figure 3). Each isolate evaluated to date appears to be composed of a mixed-infection of genetically-distinct variants
of P. relictum.
We report a minimum of 28 distinct haplotypes based on
RFLP banding patterns. While overall we detected 88

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/25

RFLP-defined haplotypes, the other 60 variants were represented by only one individual clone and await further
confirmation. Additionally, this initial survey was completed by RFLP analyses, which detects variation only at
the restriction sites of the enzymes applied. This method
inherently underestimates true variation. For example,
while one RFLP haplotype (77) appeared predominant
and was detected in all individuals, further evaluation by
SSCP and sequencing revealed additional variation. The
rarefaction curve also suggests we have underestimated
diversity, indicating a more reasonable estimate might
require substantial sampling (up to 30–40 clones per
individual). The 28 haplotypes reported here thus represent a minimum number existing in Hawaiian parasite
populations at the time of sample collection.
We evaluated several technical aspects of the study in a
side-by-side comparison in two birds. Because trap is a single-copy gene and in relatively low concentrations in a
typical blood sample from an infected bird, nested PCR
was necessary to produce enough product for visualization on an agarose gel. While nested PCR increases specificity and sensitivity of detection, a greater number of
cycles, and therefore a higher risk of enzyme error, is
inherently applied in the process. A main difference
between the two enzyme/buffer systems used is that the
FastStart High Fidelity PCR System (Roche) includes a
proofreading enzyme whereas Taq polymerase (Promega)
does not. The enzymes also require different buffers,
which may influence primer specificity. We initially used
the Promega enzyme to ensure the presence of an A overhang for downstream cloning. We found that both a
decrease in the number of cycles from 80 to 35 and the use
of the Roche system vs. the Promega system reduced the
diversity of clones generated, although the cause of this is
not entirely clear. We lessened risk of including artifactual
clones generated by nucleotide mis-incorporation by the
enzyme by excluding RFLP variants that were not confirmed by independent replication in a second bird. While
it is highly unlikely that random mis-incorporation would
occur at least twice at same restriction site, it is not impossible. Other possibilities may be that the higher variability
observed at 80 cycles (with enzyme error set aside) is the
result of amplification of rare trap haplotypes that could
be missed using fewer cycles. Or, the differences in variability observed between different enzyme/buffer systems
might be due to a change in primer specificity due to the
differing buffer recipes. Similarly, but in a different study,
we observed only minimal overlap in the sets of major
histocompatibility complex (Mhc) class II alleles amplified from birds when using the Promega enzyme/buffer
system versus when using the Roche system (Jarvi et al.,
ms. in prep). A change in specificity might be expected
and is observed using PCR+1 techniques vs. standard
methods due to incorporation of the MluI site used for

selection of homoduplexed PCR products. The addition
of these four nucleotides may alter specificity, resulting in
amplification of the greater numbers of distinct trap haplotypes observed in both birds.
The P. relictum trap gene possesses hallmark characteristics
previously defined in other Plasmodium spp. [9,27]. The
core amino acid motif of region II (sulfatide-binding
region) is 100% conserved in all P. relictum sequences, but
all P. relictum TRAP sequences possess a single amino acid
substitution (Thr instead of Ser) at the second site of this
region as compared with TRAP from other species of Plasmodium. The transmembrane region is 100% conserved
among our and other Plasmodium TRAP sequences. Also
similar to other TRAP sequences, we detected multiple
highly conserved (> 90%) repeat units of which three possess the conserved cell-recognition signal (RGD). While
the degree of conservation of these main characteristics
among trap genes from varying Plasmodium spp. appears
high, the biological significances of the changes detected
in P. relictum TRAP remain unknown.
The high diversity of trap suggested by RFLP was confirmed by sequencing with detection of 143 polymorphic
sites resulting in 87 amino acid changes. The extent of
diversity missed by RFLP analyses is clearly demonstrated
by phylogenetic network analyses of sequences (Figure 3)
with multiple haplotypes found which were initially all
assigned by RFLP as haplotype 77. Overall diversity of
sequences is low (π = 0.006/0.001), and is even lower
within haplotype 77 sequences (π = 0.003/0.001), but 18
of the total of 19 RFLP haplotype 77 clones sequenced
proved to be distinct at the nucleotide level.
A primary focus of this study is comparison of the parasite
populations from two isolates, one from Kauai (K1) and
one from Hawaii (KV115). These isolates were originally
collected from the wild; isolate KV115 originated from an
'Apapane from Kilauea Volcano area on the Big Island of
Hawaii in 1992, and isolate K1 from Elepaio from the
Alakai Wilderness Preserve on Kauai in 1995. These original samples are not currently available for evaluation.
Also, unlike the situation in primate malarias, P. relictum
has not yet been successfully cultured in the lab, thus all
studies are based on wild isolates. While overall clonal
diversity levels did not appear different between isolates
K1 and KV115, we detected a higher number of unique
RFLP clones in isolate K1 than in isolate KV115 (Table 2),
and the sequenced haplotypes from K1 and KV115 appear
clearly distinct from one another in the phylogenetic network (Figure 3). The haplotype network analysis provides
a means of inference of an ancestral haplotype (which is
boxed in Figure 3, a Kauai K1 haplotype) as compared
with those which are derived. If K1 is typical of the parasite population on Kauai (which has yet to be deter-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/25

mined), it could be that malaria parasites colonized Kauai
prior to Hawaii and have had more time to evolve (with
the ancestral type from Kauai and the higher number of
unique haplotypes so far found there). The higher
number of unique RFLP haplotypes found in K1 may also
reflect differences in selective pressures on these isolates,
or may simply be indicative of the founding population of
parasites on each island. But, while this initial analysis
provides important baseline information regarding diversity within an individual host, it is not currently sufficient
to project to geographic populations. A population level
analysis is currently underway (ME Farias, Master's thesis,
University of Hawaii at Hilo).
Clonal diversity was high as well within individual hosts
based on RFLP and sequence data from multiple clones
from three individual 'Amakihi (6, 11 and 9). A recent
study in lizards naturally infected with P. mexicanum supports data found with P. falicparum in that malaria parasites maintain high genetic diversity in host populations
even during times when transmission intensity is low
[44]. Our data in birds supports the supposition of high
clonal diversity as a general phenomena of malarial parasites. Whether this high diversity was present at the time
of introduction to the islands, evolved over time, or is due
to rapid mutation within individual infections, PCR error,
or combinations of these factors has yet to be determined.
We minimized the inclusion of clones resulting from PCR
error by using only those detected independently in two
different individuals. While it is highly unlikely that random error would occur at the same sites, trap could be a
gene very prone to copy errors. However, a high PCR error
rate is not consistent with our sequence data (Additional
File 1) as the regions we expect to be conserved (e.g. the
transmembrane region and others) are in fact highly conserved. The relationships revealed in the haplotype network indicate a more likely scenario. There is clear
delineation between haplotypes of K1 versus KV115,
regardless of host. Within hosts (i.e., Amakihis 6 and 11)
haplotypes tend to cluster relatively closely together and
have one central haplotype from which others are derived.
Also, data suggests a single lineage of P. relictum exists in
Hawaii based on mtDNA genes [39]. We have no definitive data on clonal diversity levels at the time of introduction to the Hawaiian islands, so we can not address these
comparisons at this time, but our findings with the trap
gene appear consistent with the possibility that rapid
mutation is occurring within each host, most likely after
infection with a single or relatively few initial clones
(clonal genetic structure). We know within-host selection
may play a role in the generation of new variants. While
we did not find strong evidence for selection in our limited dataset (trap sequences display a higher number of
nonsynonymous substitutions then synonymous, but
when normalized for synonymous substistutions, the dN/

Biology Direct 2008, 3:25

dS value equals 1), previous studies in human malarias
from more geographically-diverse samplings have
reported evidence of positive selection on trap in P. falciparum [9] and P. vivax [42]. The same finding in our ongoing population-level studies would provide one
mechanism for generation of within-host diversity.
We detected 87 amino acid changes with 13 sites occurring in two or more sequences. These polymorphic sites
form the basis of our SNP-based analysis of trap diversity
in wild populations. Of the five dimorphic amino acid
sites detected, site 430 (trap nucleotide position 1289)
appears to be particularly interesting. All clones from a
single host bird are either G or C at 1289, none of the
birds evaluated had a mixture of alleles at this position.
This polymorphism appears to be isolate-specific, and not
dependent on geographic origin (both polymorphisms
are present in wild birds from both Hawaii and Kauai),
and, at first glance, does not appear related to survivorship
as both are present in survivors and non-survivors, but the
resulting amino acid change, from alanine to proline,
could have a significant impact on protein folding and
function.
We know from previous studies that some birds survive
while others do not when infected with either K1 or
KV115 [20]. If trap is a determinant of virulence we would
expect that some haplotypes would be present in survivors
and not in non-survivors and vice-versa, and this is what
we find. We also observed slightly (but not significantly)
higher levels of clonal diversity among parasite populations from survivors, with some of that diversity localized
to the cytoplasmic tail. Studies of mixed-genotype malarial infections indicate that transmission rates of individual
genotypes are often higher from mixed rather than from
single-clone infections [4]. Higher clonal diversity could
be a significant driving force for both increasing transmission rates and moderating parasite virulence.

Methods
Isolates of P. relictum
The two laboratory isolates of P. relictum that were used in
this study originated from wild hosts on Kauai or Hawaii
Islands. The KV115 isolate was obtained in 1992 from a
wild 'Apapane (Himatione sanguinea) captured at Kilauea
Crater in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park [33]. The K1
isolate was obtained from pooled blood samples from
three Elepaio (Chasiempis sandwichensis) captured in the
Alakai Wilderness Preserve in August 1994 [20]. Blood
from only one of the three Elepaio was later found to have
a detectable parasitemia by microscopy. Fresh,
heparinized blood from wild hosts was inoculated intravenously into individual canaries (passage 1) to amplify
the number of parasites prior to aliquoting and cryopreservation of the isolates.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/25

The KV115 isolate was passed once in a canary prior to
freezing. Several weeks prior to infection of 'Amakihi in
this study, an aliquot was thawed, deglycerolized, and
inoculated intravenously into an uninfected canary (passage 2). When parasitemia was detectable by blood smear,
approximately 0.1 cc of heparinized whole blood was
passed intravenously into a one week-day-old Pekin
Duckling (passage 3), passed two more times into Pekin
Ducklings to amplify parasitemia and then inoculated
into three Pekin Ducklings (passage 6) that were used to
infect mosquitoes (Culex quinquefasciatus) as described by
Atkinson et al. [33].
After initial recovery in a canary (passage 1), The K1 isolate was passaged into a second canary (passage 2), and 4
Pekin Ducklings (passages 3–6) prior to aliquoting and
cryopreservation. Several weeks prior to infection of
'Amakihi, an aliquot was thawed, deglycerolized and
inoculated intravenously into a Pekin Duckling (passage
7) and subsequently passaged two more times in Pekin
Ducklings (passages 8 and 9) to increase parasitemia prior
to infection of mosquitoes.
Sample collection
Experimental infections
Adult Hawaii 'Amakihi were captured with mist nets in
January 1995 in high elevation xeric habitat in the Mauna
Kea Forest Reserve, transported to a screened mosquitoproof aviary at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park and acclimated to captivity as described elsewhere [34,20]. Birds
were exposed to single infective mosquito bites from individual Culex quinquefaciatus that were reared in a closed
colony and infected with either the K1 or KV115 isolates
of P. relictum as described by Atkinson et al. [20]. Five
birds were infected with the KV115 isolate from the island
of Hawaii and 6 Hawaii 'Amakihi were similarly exposed
to the K1 isolate of P. relictum from the island of Kauai. All
birds were bled via the brachial vein for preparation of
blood smears every 4 days or via the jugular vein for collection of DNA samples. Birds that died during the course
of infection from acute malaria were necropsied to verify
cause of death. Blood samples from live birds and pectoral
muscle tissue taken during necropsy were stored frozen in
lysis buffer until DNA was extracted [18].
Natural infections
Wild birds were captured with mist nets in the Alakai Wilderness Reserve on Kauai, in the Hanawi Natural Area
Reserve on Maui, or Kona Unit of Hakalau Forest National
Wildlife Refuge and Nanawale Forest Reserve on the
island of Hawaii. Approximately 100 μl of blood was collected via jugular venipuncture into a heparinized 1.0 cc
insulin syringe, transferred to microhematocrit tubes and
centrifuged to collect plasma. Packed red blood cells were
transferred to lysis buffer and stored frozen until DNA was

extracted. Summation of all samples, origin, and dates of
collection are described in Table 1.
DNA isolation
Genomic DNA was extracted from tissue samples using
standard techniques. Briefly, samples were digested in 1
ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM sodium EDTA, 2% SDS
with 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K overnight at 55°C. DNA
extractions were completed with one phenol, two phenol/
dimethyl chloride 1:1, and one dimethyl chloride/isoamyl alcohol (24:1) extraction steps, and dialyzed against
10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA. DNA concentration was quantified by spectrophotometry or agarose gel
electrophoresis.
Nested PCR amplification of the trap gene
Standard PCR
Between 250 and 1000 ng of genomic DNA was used as
template in a 25 μl reaction containing 1.6 μM each primers P1 (GAT GAA ATA AACAT TACTACAGT GAA CGAA AGTAT
TGT) and P2 (CCA ACTC AGTT ATTC TTC ATGG TAA) (Jarvi
et al. 2002), 1× reaction buffer, 4 mM MgCl2, 0.8 mM
total dNTPs, and 1.25 units Taq DNA polymerase
(Promega). Samples were subjected to 40 cycles of 94°C
for 30 seconds, 45°C for 1 minute, and 72°C for 2 minutes. 5 μl of product from the first reaction was then used
as template in a 50 μl reaction containing 0.8 μM each
primers P5 (GACCTTTATATACTAATGGATGG) and P6
(CCTTCACCAAGTACATCATT) [18], 1× reaction buffer, 2
mM MgCl2, 0.6 mM total dNTPs, and 1.67 units Taq DNA
polymerase. Cycling parameters were 40 cycles of 94°C
for 30 seconds, 50°C for 1 minute, and 72°C for 2 minutes. PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on
1.5% agarose gels (SeaKem, FMC Bioproducts) and reactions producing a band at approximately 1650 bp were
considered to be successful. Products were purified on a
low melting point agarose gel (see below) and stored at 20°C until cloning.
PCR + 1 amplification
In order to eliminate the possibility of heteroduplex formation, PCR + 1 methods as described by Boriello and
Krauter [21] were used. The first reaction took place as
described above, except that only 0.8 μM each primers P1
and P2 were used. 3 μl of this product was used as template in an asymmetric nested PCR reaction consisting of
0.4 μM primer P6 and 0.04 μM primer P5. Remaining
parameters were as described above for the second reaction. The approximately 1650 bp product was then run on
a 1.5% low melting point agarose gel, excised, and gel
purified using the QIAQuick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen,
Inc.) according to manufacturer's instructions. Between
12 and 20 μl of purified product was used as template in
a 50 μl reaction volume containing 0.8 μM primer
P5.MLU (5' ACGCGTGACCTTTATATACTAATGGATGG

3') only, with remaining reaction components as above.
Samples were subjected to a single cycle of 94°C for 1
minute, 50°C for 2 minutes, and 72°C for 10 minutes.
Samples then were stored at 4°C or -20°C until cloning.
FastStart High Fidelity PCR + 1 amplification
Side by side amplifications were performed using Taq
polymerase (Promega) and the FastStart High Fidelity
PCR System (Roche). Conditions for the Promega reactions were as described for the PCR + 1, except that the
final volume for the second reaction was reduced to 25 μl.
The number of cycles was also reduced to 15 in the first
reaction and 20 in the nested reaction. The Roche first
reaction contained 1.0 μM each primers P1 and P2 [18],
1× reaction buffer, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.9 mM total dNTPs, and
1.25 units Fast Start High Fidelity Enzyme Blend (Roche).
The Roche nested reaction contained 0.4 μM primer P6,
0.04 μM primer P5, 1× reaction buffer, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.6
mM total dNTPs, 4% DMSO and 1.25 units Fast Start
High Fidelity Enzyme Blend (Roche). All other conditions
were identical to those described for Promega reactions in
this section. The single PCR + 1 cycle for both Promega
and Roche reactions utilized Taq DNA polymerase
(Promega) to ensure incorporation of the A-overhangs
necessary for TA cloning.
Cloning of PCR Products
Gel-purified PCR products or PCR + 1 products were
ligated into the pCR 2.1-TOPO vector and transformed
into TOP10F' E. coli using the manufacturer's suggested
protocol (TOPO TA Cloning Kit, Invitrogen). Colonies
were screened by PCR amplification using primers P5 and
P6 for regular PCR products or plasmid primers M13F20
and M13R (Invitrogen) for PCR + 1 products. PCR + 1 colonies were further screened by digestion of the M13 PCR
product with the restriction enzyme MluI. Plasmid DNA
was obtained using the QIAprep Mini Kit (Qiagen)
according to the manufacturer's suggested protocol.
Amplification of cloned fragments for RFLP analysis
For non-PCR+1 products, the cloned trap gene fragment
was amplified directly from the colonies. Cells picked
directly from a single colony were added to a PCR reaction
containing 1.6 μM each primers P5 and P6, 1× reaction
buffer, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.8 mM total dNTPs, and 1.67 units
Taq DNA polymerase (Promega). The reactions were
heated at 94°C for 1 min, then subjected to 40 cycles of
94°C for 30 seconds, 50°C for 1 minute, and 72°C for 2
minutes. For PCR+1 products, the cloned trap gene fragment was amplified from the M13 PCR product used for
colony screening or from plasmid DNA. 1 μl of PCR product diluted 1:100 or 1 μl of plasmid DNA diluted 1:200
was used as template in a 50 μl reaction containing 0.4
μM each primers P5 and P6, 1× reaction buffer, 2 mM
MgCl2, 0.6 mM total dNTPs, and 1.25 units Taq DNA

polymerase (Promega). Cycling parameters consisted of 5
cycles of 94°C for 30 seconds, 65°C for 1 minute, and
72°C for 1 minute, followed by 5 cycles with an annealing
temperature of 63°C and 20 cycles with an annealing
temperature of 60°C. Denaturing and extension times
and temperatures did not change.
RFLP analysis
P5 and P6 PCR products (5 μl) amplified from clones
were digested in a total volume of 10 μl with EcoRI (10
units), HpaII (10 units), or TaqαI (20 units) in corresponding 1× reaction buffer (New England BioLabs). The TaqαI
digestion also contained BSA at a concentration of 100
μg/ml. Digestions were incubated at 37°C (EcoRI, and
HpaII) or 65°C (TaqαI) for 90 minutes, then stored at 4°C
prior to RFLP analysis. All digested trap fragments were
run on 2% agarose gels (3 NuSieve:1 SeaKem, FMC Bioproducts) in 1× TBE buffer at 100 V for 1 hour and 15
minutes with 100 bp DNA ladder (New England Biolabs)
every 13 lanes. Further resolution of some clones was
achieved by electrophoresis on 10% non-denaturing acrylamide gels in 1× TBE (PAGEr Gold, Cambrex) at 150 V
for 1 hour and 20 minutes. TIFF images of ethidium bromide-stained gels were scanned and imported into BioNumerics v. 3.5 (Applied Maths). The gels were normalized
using the ladder and common bands. Automatic band
calling and band matching were hand corrected.

rarefaction curve was generated in Primer v.5 [24] with
mean values of expected species richness ESn plotted in
Systat (vers 11.00.01). Statistical comparisons of diversity
estimates were also completed in Systat (vers 11.00.01).
Sequence data was used to produce a phylogenetic network using statistical parsimony to connect the haplotypes based on 95% confidence interval (TCS 1.21) [28].
Distance analyses (Tamura 3-parameter with pairwise
deletion) of sequence data were conducted using MEGA
version 3.1 [46].

Reviewers' comments
Review 1 (Joseph J Schall, University of Vermont,
Department of Biology, Burlington VT, USA; nominated by Laura Landweber, Dept. of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ,
USA)
The arrival of the avian malaria parasite Plasmodium relictum on the Hawaiian islands in the early 20th century
(about century after a competent vector was introduced by
accidental human action) led to an ecological catastrophe
of almost biblical proportions. Many endemic bird species were reduced in density, altered in their distribution,
or driven to extinction. The phenomenon of the bird community was destroyed. Apart from the heartbreaking
esthetic loss, these events argue that pathogens may have
always played a role in shaping biodiversity. Even rare
such events would have long-term importance. And, the
Hawaiian bird malaria story warns us the emerging infectious disease can have the broadest consequences.
The Hawaiian bird malaria team has produced a string of
reports that rank among the most important in the history
of parasitology. Here, the team members examine the
genetic diversity of the TRAP gene. TRAP is an important

Biology Direct 2008, 3:25

surface protein involved in the weird gliding movement of
apicomplexan cells.
The authors report three general findings:
1. The structure of the gene and protein is characterized in
some detail.
I have only limited experience with such analysis, and so
can offer no informed comments.
2. There is some relationship between virulence and allele
diversity of TRAP per host. The manuscript brings up
"host survivorship" [Abstract line 38] or "surviving birds"
[first mention on line 136]. What this means is not provided until line 431/432, so this survivor issue drops out
of nowhere. Also, there were only 18 birds under study, so
with this small sample size, nothing can be inferred about
the allelic diversity of TRAP and survival of experimental
birds. Therefore, I will not pursue this issue here, and feel
that the topic should not be included in an otherwise fine
presentation.
Authors' response: This is quite right. This manuscript is
intended as a genetic analysis of several individual hosts
to begin to characterize diversity and develop additional
methods for future population-level analysis based on
trap. It not at all intended as an analysis of survivors and
non-survivors of avian malaria. However, many of the
individuals under study were involved in experimental
infection studies. The author's feel compelled to include
this data here, but we have reworked it so as to more accurately reflect its somewhat minimal significance.
3. There is a substantial diversity of TRAP alleles even
within single infections. At least 88 alleles are identified,
and this appears to underestimate the true diversity. Of
these, 28 appear in more than one bird examined, and are
thus given the closest attention. This allelic diversity could
be a result of (i) a large number of genotypes of the parasite arriving over the past decades; (ii) mutation of the
TRAP gene leading to diversity after the parasite became
established; (iii) a combination of (i) and (ii); (iv) rapid
mutation of TRAP within individual infections leading to
new variants even if an infection began with a single
allele; (v) PCR artifacts leading to an apparently high
diversity. My reading of the results comes to a different
outlook on the story than the authors', but this different
conclusion would still would be a very interesting and
important.
Malaria researchers for many years have suspected that the
surface proteins of Plasmodium may be under selection to
mutate rapidly. Diversity may be favored in response to
the attack of the immune system. Previous studies on the

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/25

malaria parasites of humans have found a very large
number of alleles for surface protein genes cycling in a single population (84 alleles detected in one study, similar to
the results for TRAP in P. relictum). A very rapid mutation
rate may even lead to new alleles appearing during the
course of a single infection.
The "Conclusions" begin with the statement: "This study
shows that the genetic diversity of Hawaiian isolates of P.
relictum is much higher than previously recognized. These
results indicate the widespread presence of multiple-genotype infections in the native birds of Hawaii." But,
another conclusion could be reached. If there is very rapid
mutation of TRAP (at least the variable portions of the
gene), we might imagine a clonal genetic structure, with
no variation in the genome except for the genes coding for
surface proteins. That is, case (iv) and even case (v) above
may be the situation.
Authors' response: These are valid points. We have now
included a phylogenetic network analysis (at the suggestion of another reviewer) from which we were able to provide a clearer presentation of the relationships of
(sequenced) haplotypes. These data appear consistent
with (iv) above, rapid mutation, and have now been
included.
The number of infections studied was 2 from lab birds
(from two infections collected in nature, I assume (isolates KV115 and K1), and 7 more wild-caught birds. So,
we have 9 infections under study. From those 9 infections,
there are 80+ alleles. Also reported is that more alleles are
detected if the PCR is run for 80 cycles vs. 35 cycles. This
last result suggests that mutations are taking place during
the PCR. After all, PCR replicates what happens in cells, so
this seems to indicate that the gene is very prone to copy
errors.
Authors' response: While one can never totally eliminate
the possibility of random PCR error, we took several steps
to minimize inclusion of clones with higher potential for
error. We only included clones produced independently
in two or more birds under the assumption that random
error is unlikely to occur independently twice at the same
restriction sites. We used the Promega enzyme system for
two reasons. One was that it allowed for the A- overhang
needed for cloning, and also it was the common system in
use at the time of data collection (prior to the common
availability of the Roche enzyme system). We also
included PCR+1 methods into our protocol to insure
sequencing of only homoduplex clones, which eliminates
issue of chimeric sequences due to heteroduplex formation in PCR. Even the clones produced primarily using the
Roche enzyme system had at least one cycle using
Promega (PCR+1 cycle, which also added the overhang).

While there is some degree of randomness to the polymorphisms observed among sequences, the high degree
of conservation of sequence in regions known to be critical to proper function (and are quite highly conserved
across species) doesn't support the proposition of high
PCR error, which one would expect to be random.
The study has available the data to test the "real genetic
variation" vs. "rapid generation of variants" hypotheses.
Infection K1 was passed to 6 birds, and KV115 to 5 birds.
Thus, we would expect to find the same alleles in all the
recipient birds as in the donor bird. Are the same alleles
found? Over the course of the infection, are the same alleles found? Or, are different alleles found in the recipients,
and do new alleles show up during the infection? There
are no such bird-by-bird results presented in the manuscript.
Authors' response: We wish we had the samples from the
original infections with which to compare. Unfortunately,
we don't. We are in the process of trying to complete this
type of analysis at this time with more recently derived
samples. Thank you for your suggestions.
Researchers working with human malaria parasites would
read this paper with great interest, and would conclude
that this is a very nice example of the rapid mutation of a
surface protein gene, and another example of how these
proteins interact with the immune system and are selected
to generate variation (analogous to the VAT's in Trypanosoma).

In this work Dr. Susan Jarvi and colleagues examine the
genetic diversity of the TRAP gene in Hawaiian isolates of
the avian malaria parasite Plasmodium relictum. They PCR
amplify the TRAP gene (which is known to be highly polymorphic in other Plasmodium species) from DNA extracts
from the blood of 18 birds of various Hawaiian species,
clone the products to allow detection of multiple parasite
isolates within each bird, and examine the clones by
restriction fragment length polymorphism and sequencing.
The study examined TRAP diversity from 7 birds that had
been naturally infected with P. relictum, 5 birds that had
been experimentally infected with one P. relictum isolate
that had been maintained in laboratory contained mos-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/25

quitoes, and 6 birds that had been experimentally infected
with another laboratory maintained isolate.
The study found multiple TRAP haplotypes in most birds.
Since Plasmodium parasites are haploid in blood stages
this indicates that there is significant genetic diversity in
Hawaiian P. relictum and that most infections contain
multiple parasite clones.
Main comments
Jarvi et al. clearly show there is significant genetic diversity
in Hawaiian P. relictum and that most infections contain
multiple parasite clones. However, greater understanding
of the TRAP gene, or of the population genetics of Hawaiian P. relictum will require more data. However the reliable data produced are rather limited, and some of the data
analysis is handled inappropriately, in my view. I detail
these problems below.

First, the authors own controls indicated that their methods (PCR amplification with a non proof-reading Taq for
80 PCR cycles) produced some PCR-induced polymorphism artefacts. Although PCR-induced polymorphism is
not expected to produce patterns such as geographic or
phenotypic associations (rather just to add noise), it will
increase measures of genetic diversity. The majority of
data was produced with the non proof-reading Taq using
80 PCR cycles, however there is no consideration of this in
results/discussion sections.
Authors' response: We completed this small trial to evaluate these variables in our system. We don't believe that
PCR error is significantly impacting estimates of genetic
diversity in this study as we have included only clones
found independently in two or more separate birds.
Please also see previous response to similar concerns of
Reviewer 1.
Also, RFLP haplotype data from two birds were effectively
removed from the study because they contained unique
haplotypes. This will also have the effect of increasing estimates of diversity.
Finally there was a non-random selection of which clones
to sequence. Proportionally more clones were chosen
from the rarer RFLP haplotypes. This choice will also have
the effect of increasing measures of genetic diversity from
the sequence data. The result is that while estimates of
genetic diversity are high from sequence (genetic diversity
=~ 0.06) it is difficult to know how much of this value is
artefact, and hence how to compare these values directly
to other studies.
Authors' response: We removed the birds from the estimates of genetic diversity because of the minimal data col-

Biology Direct 2008, 3:25

lected (only 2 clones and 1 clone were obtained from each
of these birds). We did not try to produce more clones
from these birds, but kept them in the overall study as we
had obtained sequence data from one of them. To include
them in the estimates would bias them in the other direction. We sequenced 18 clones from the most common
RFLP haplotype (77) and 15 clones representing 12 other
haplotypes. I don't believe we disproportionately selected
the more rare haplotypes. Since this is not a populationlevel study, these results may not be directly comparable
to other studies.
Another limitation of this study is that apart from the
RFLP analysis, the sequence data produced in this study is
relatively small. Only 14 TRAP sequences were produced
from one of the cultured isolates (10 of which from a single bird infection), 16 from another (again, 10 of which
from a single bird infection) and 5 from wild isolates
(none of which are derived from high fidelity Taq). The
result is that few of the more interesting conjectures in the
discussion have significant support. For example there
was no significant difference between diversity estimates
of the two mosquito-derived isolates, or the wild isolates,
nor between those birds that survived experimental infections vs. those that did not. Collection of more sequences
from more isolates would allow analysis of the frequency
distributions of polymorphisms, and be much more
informative. To be fair the authors state that population
level genotyping is underway. I would caution readers
from drawing too many conclusions until this analysis is
available.
For example, I would regard any clustering of TRAP isolates with respect to mortality with strong suspicion.
While the TRAP gene may contribute to mortality, an association between mortality was not shown (recall that most
sequence data are from two isolates from experimentallyinfected birds from cultured parasites), and even if it were
shown we would need evidence that this association was
not due to population subdivision or to linkage with
another causal variant.
In summary I think that the data has been extended
beyond what it is capable of describing, and may also be
limited by PCR-artefacts. Certainly there is no subterfuge
about this in the manuscript (the authors for the most
part describe the limitations), but the results could well
have been limited to a simpler story. Further work on this
system, particularly with the improvements that have
been shown to be necessary with the data in this work,
should provide a much more informative picture.
Authors' response: I think it is important to realize that
this manuscript is only intended as an initial attempt to
begin to genetically characterize diversity in a previously

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/25

uncharacterized species of Plasmodium. It not intended as
an analysis of survivors and non-survivors of avian
malaria. However, as noted above, many of the individuals under study were involved in experimental infection
studies and we feel compelled to include this data here.
We have reworked the discussion to reflect this concern.
We also included a more detailed description of the isolates. Thank you for your suggestions.

History, Assistant Curator, Division of Invertebrate
Zoology, Central Park West at 79th Street, New York, NY
10024: nominated by Eugene Koonin, Senior Investigator NCBI, NLM, NIH Bethesda, MD 20894)
I found this manuscript, by Jarvi, Farias, and Atkinson to
be very interesting and thorough. It also represents an
important addition to our knowledge of the nonmammalian and/or non-model system malaria parasites with
respect to the genetic diversity that is naturally present in
these systems. When I first began reading this manuscript,
I immediately worried that some of the high amount of
genetic variability might have been caused by heteroduplex formation and bacterial repair during the cloning
process, so was very relieved when the authors said that
they also incorporated PCR+1 methodology into this
study. That said, though, I found it slightly unusual that
instead of bumping up the reaction to 80 cycles, they did
not also choose to try a scenario of using a very small
number of cycles and then pooling these products – a
method that is commonly used among microbiologists
who are trying to assess diversity in an environment in an
attempt to recover rarer organisms (sequences) that might
be swamped out by more common ones through the PCR
amplification process. My second suggestion is that I
think that their sequence data would be far better represented by a haplotype network rather than a traditional,
bifurcating tree. As the authors admit, the bootstrap support values on most nodes are very low and this is no
doubt a result of a more network-like scenario of evolution that resulted from one or a few haplotypes founding
these populations and then accumulating point mutations as the populations expanded and dispersed. A bifurcating, distance-based tree such as the one in Figure 2, will
be complicated and distorted by this pattern of evolutionary change. Representing the data as such, along with perhaps shading to depict those sequences found in survivors
vs. non-survivors might reveal more interesting and clearcut patterns than this NJ tree could ever do.
Authors' response: Yes, I wish I had thought of that at the
time (i.e., pooling reactions using smaller numbers of
cycles). Thank you for your suggestion of a haplotype network. We completed this analysis and it is much more

Page 15 of 17

Biology Direct 2008, 3:25

informative than a NJ tree. We have incorporated these
data into the manuscript.
At times, this paper also seemed like a mixture of what
would be two or perhaps even three different publications. There was the central issue of how much genetic
diversity of the TRAP gene – and ergo, number of parasite
clones, exists within infected birds and whether or not this
diversity is related to host or geography. There was also
the attempt to look at the correlation of the presence of
certain TRAP sequences to survival in infected birds and
this was discussed, in part, with particular changes within
the TRAP molecule. Finally, there was the embedded
study of enzyme, cycle number, and methodology
(PCR+1 or not) and their relationships to the number of
clones recovered. Perhaps the authors should consider if
these three things might not be better split as such to show
that first, the optimum method for detecting clonal diversity was found and used and then that the resulting data
on the diversity of genotypes was then analyzed in a context to allow for the most powerful ability to correlate virulence with genotype (ideally by sequencing all genotypes
present in these infections).
Authors' response: Yes, we are packing a lot in a single
paper, but individually, the pieces do not seem substantial
enough to warrant a publication on their own.

You may want to explain the origin of the K1 and KV115
isolates – these are not "cloned isolates" in the sense that
human and rodent malaria researchers are used to thinking about them.
I would advocate for including the primer sequences here,
even if they are published elsewhere. This will facilitate
the ability of others to use them, if desired, without having to track down multiple other publications, which they
may or may not have easy access to.
