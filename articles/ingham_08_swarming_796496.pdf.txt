Abstract
Background: Swarming motility allows microorganisms to move rapidly over surfaces. The Grampositive bacterium Paenibacillus vortex exhibits advanced cooperative motility on agar plates
resulting in intricate colonial patterns with geometries that are highly sensitive to the environment.
The cellular mechanisms that underpin the complex multicellular organization of such a simple
organism are not well understood.
Results: Swarming by P. vortex was studied by real-time light microscopy, by in situ scanning
electron microscopy and by tracking the spread of antibiotic-resistant cells within antibioticsensitive colonies. When swarming, P. vortex was found to be peritrichously flagellated. Swarming
by the curved cells of P. vortex occurred on an extremely wide range of media and agar
concentrations (0.3 to 2.2% w/v). At high agar concentrations (> 1% w/v) rotating colonies formed
that could be detached from the main mass of cells by withdrawal of cells into the latter. On lower
percentage agars, cells moved in an extended network composed of interconnected "snakes" with
short-term collision avoidance and sensitivity to extracts from swarming cells. P. vortex formed
single Petri dish-wide "supercolonies" with a colony-wide exchange of motile cells. Swarming cells
were coupled by rapidly forming, reversible and non-rigid connections to form a loose raft,
apparently connected via flagella. Inhibitors of swarming (p-Nitrophenylglycerol and Congo Red)
were identified. Mitomycin C was used to trigger filamentation without inhibiting growth or
swarming; this facilitated dissection of the detail of swarming. Mitomycin C treatment resulted in
malcoordinated swarming and abortive side branch formation and a strong tendency by a
subpopulation of the cells to form minimal rotating aggregates of only a few cells.
Conclusion: P. vortex creates complex macroscopic colonies within which there is considerable
reflux and movement and interaction of cells. Cell shape, flagellation, the aversion of cell masses to
fuse and temporary connections between proximate cells to form rafts were all features of the
swarming and rotation of cell aggregates. Vigorous vortex formation was social, i.e. required > 1
cell. This is the first detailed examination of the swarming behaviour of this bacterium at the cellular
level.

Background
Bacteria cultured on semi-solid media display colony
morphologies which are characteristic of a species, strain
and/or particular mode of growth [1-19]. Colony recognition is a major feature of microbiology, with applications
in species identification and phenotyping. The structure
of cells and the extracellular material within colonies and
biofilms is generated by the interplay of many factors
including gradients of nutrients and waste products, extracellular polymers and surfactants, cell surface properties,
programmed cell death and differentiation, environmental sensing and intercellular signaling [19-41]. In some
instances, the resultant masses of cells are striking, with
intricate patterns of growth that cover the surface of a Petri
dish from a single point of inoculation. Pattern formation
is an intriguing form of multicellular organization of the
microbial community [42-48]. Microbial pattern formation has been used as a model for complex open systems
and as the basis for understanding the organization of
cells in eukaryotic tissues and diseases [43,49,50].
Bacterial motility is a dispersal mechanism involved in
generating macroscopic patterns. For example, the periodic flagella-driven swarming of the Gram-negative bacterium Proteus mirabilis results in concentric rings of
alternating swarming and vegetative growth [51]. Myxococcus xanthus, another Gram-negative colonial bacterium
but one with gliding motility, generates fruiting bodies in
which different cells make unequal contributions; some
cells effectively sacrifice themselves for the colony
[31,32,34]. The microaerophilic bacterium Thiovulum
majus can form complex honeycomb patterns on marine
surfaces [52]. Gram-positive bacteria, related to Bacillus
subtilis, use flagella to swarm to form elaborate and convoluted colonies with chiral and/or fractal geometries.
Lubricant polymers and detergents are involved in many
of these processes [53,54]. However, the biological basis
of pattern formation, particularly in Gram-positive bacteria, is not well understood.
Not all dispersal in extended bacterial colonies is generated by motility. B. subtilis can form complex multicellular
structures without motility, such as macrofibres on 2D
surfaces or fruiting bodies [55]. Bacillus mycoides is also
able to create asymmetric patterns from growth of
extended chains of non-motile but filamentous cells [19].
Non-motile strains of the Enterobacteriaceae can also form
fractal patterns [21]. As with motile organisms, surfactants
and extracellular polymers are often important in facilitating colony extension [19,21].
Some Paenibacillus species (Gram-positive, spore-forming
aerobes that were previously classified as Bacillus species),
can exhibit complex pattern forming behavior. Clinical
isolates of P. alvei swarm over agar plates [56]. Paenibacil-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/36

lus spp., such as P. alvei and P. denditiformis, have different
repertoires of patterns or morphotypes [4,5,8,9,16,39,4548,57]. P. vortex is a motile and colonial Paenibacillus
which swarms so effectively on agar that it is difficult to
maintain it as an isolated colony. P. vortex is so named
because of the vigorous rotation of entire colonies, and of
areas within colonies [14,16,26]. As for other swarming
Gram-positive bacteria, development of social motility in
P. vortex is dependent on the properties of the surface
being traversed, including the agar concentration and the
degree to which it is lubricated by the bacterium [39,4548]. Swarming is exceptionally sensitive to the environmental conditions, including nutrients, humidity and
stresses such as those imposed by sub-lethal doses of antibiotics [35]. One particular property of P. vortex is that
some of the information required to form features of a
pattern is apparently retained through successive generations [39,46-48]. P. vortex is not well developed with
respect to genetics or molecular biology.
The recent isolation of P. vortex may offer a significant
advantage in studying complex social organization. Many
of the multicellular characteristics of bacteria are lost with
serial sub-culturing and so can be deficient in the model
laboratory strains. For example, biofilm development,
fruiting body formation and swarming are all found more
robustly in less passaged isolates of B. subtilis [53] than in
the "highly domesticated" strain B. subtilis 168. Also, a
Bacillus mycoides type strain was found to have lost the
ability to organize into complex patterns and recent work
on this phenomenon was necessarily performed on fresh
isolates [19]. M. xanthus complex multicellular properties
are also selected against by prolonged growth in a homogeneous environment [27]. P. vortex was originally isolated as an outgrowth from a B. subtilis colony. Isolation
of pattern-forming bacteria from B. subtilis cultures
appears to have occurred several times [4,6,57-59].
The fascinating subject of microbial pattern formation
remains to be explored in detail by microbiologists. In
this work we describe this phenomenon in P. vortex grown
mainly on rich agar plates. The complex bacterial dynamics and organization were monitored by in situ electron
microscopy; moving cells were imaged in real time by
light microscopy and the spread of cells within colonies
was mapped by tracking mutants.

Results
Macroscopic pattern formation by P. vortex on gel
surfaces
Previously, colonial development of the P. vortex bacteria
was studied during growth on Peptone plates and relatively hard surfaces (≥ 2% w/v agar). An example of representative colonial pattern in such setting is shown in Fig
1A. For more details see Refs [14,16,26,30,45-48]. These

A typical
A typical colonial pattern generated by P. vortex when grown on 2.25% (w/v) agar with 2% (w/v) peptone in a 9
cm Petri dish. A. Whole colony view. Each vortex (the condensed group of bacteria – the bright dots) is composed of many
cells that swarm collectively around their common center at about 10 μm/s. B. An individual vortex – the diameter of the vortex is 75 μm. Both clockwise and anticlockwise rotating vortices are observed, although the majority have the same handedness.

patterns are characterized by the formation of vortices –
aggregates of tens to thousands of cells that rotate around
a common center and move as a coherent unit. On softer
surfaces (not shown here) the colonies are no longer composed of vortices and their shapes ("snakelike") was similar to that exhibited in Fig. 2A during growth on MuellerHinton (MH) plates.
The P. vortex cells in the vortices that develop on plates
with high concentrations of agar replicate, and the vortex
expands in size and moves outward as a unit, leaving
behind a trail of motile but usually non-replicating cells –
the vortex branch. The vortices vary in size from tens to
thousands of bacteria, according to their location in the
colony (Fig. 1B). The dynamics of the vortices is quite
complicated and includes attraction, repulsion, merging
and splitting of vortices. However, these patterns take a
relatively long time to form (days). Additionally, motility
on very high concentrations of agar tend not to be sustained with illumination during imaging. Because of these
two factors, the study was performed on MH agar at <
0.7% and 1.5% w/v agar (termed low and high percentage
agar respectively) upon which motility was vigorous and
sustained, which suited the dynamic imaging and tracking
approach used.
Inoculation of MH agar plates resulted in the initiation of
swarming motility within 5–8 h when incubated at temperatures from 25 to 37°C. Swarming occurred on the surface of agar at concentrations from 0.3 to 2.2% (w/v) but
only under aerobic conditions; no growth was observed

under anaerobic conditions. At 2.2 to 2.6% (w/v) agar
swarming occurred but was erratic, i.e. not always initiating and sometimes stalling without covering the entire
plate. The patterns of swarming on 1.5% MH agar showed
fractal patterns (Fig. 2A) or and/or dispersed colonies similar to those previously described during growth on Peptone plates [14,16,26,30,45-48]. At lower agar
concentrations swarming was a highly efficient method of
dispersal and growth. In liquid culture, aerated with vigorous shaking overnight, 20 ml of MH medium supported
1.3 × 109 cfu/ml. Swarming solely on the surface of 20 ml
of MH (0.3% w/v) agar supported up to 7.7 × 108 cfu/ml.
Colonial growth, but not swarming, was observed at 42°C
irrespective of the agar concentration. Where multiple
inoculations were made on the same plate, colonies fused
provided the cells were swarming rapidly, > 3 mm/h (data
not shown). Such collisions occurred on both high and
low percentage agars. However, where swarming was relatively slow (< 3 mm/h) then colonies did not merge,
which is as previously described for swarming on peptone-based media [14,16,26,30,45-48].
At low agar concentrations (< 0.7 %) detachment of aggregates was never observed; all regions of microbial growth
were visibly a single network. The arrangement of the
spreading colony was fairly evenly spaced masses of > 4
mm across linked by 2–4 connecting strands of < 0.7 mm
and spaced every 4–8 mm or a more even network (Fig.
2B). It was possible to culture highly branched, macroscopic colonies over 8 cm across. The patterns formed suggested that whilst motile masses of cells could meet, as

indicated by the formation of rings and loops, there was a
degree of avoidance of this event. This is implied by the
fact that in the later stages of swarming there was a tendency for multiple outgrowths to invade the remaining
open areas of agar but not fuse with other cell masses
(Figs. 2C and 2D).
Real time imaging of swarming motility
Low percentage agars
On agars < 0.7 % (w/v) motility was vigorous, with extension rates of cell masses in excess of 1 cm/h under optimal
conditions. Detachment of cell masses into isolated colonies was never seen. The motile, extending "snakes" typical of this environment showed a marked aversion to
fusing with other cell masses. This was the case for 6/6

studies of masses within 40 μm of each other over 2–3 h;
in all cases the "snake" changed direction, apparently to
avoid the collision. Fig. 3D shows a typical example,
where the tip of the snake veered away from another cell
mass (in this case a section of the same elongating cell
mass) twice within 2 h. We were unable to catch any
fusion events between cell masses in real time over a
period of a few hours.
Dilution of motile masses (c. 10-fold), using drops of prewarmed MH medium, resulted in visible motility of >
95% of the cells in the field of view. Subsequently, rafts of
cells reformed (within 2–15 min) in which the cells were
still motile but were noticeably more aggregated. Observation of cells swimming immediately after greater dilutions

suggested that cells in liquid culture swam at speeds up to
10 μm/s, provided there was access to oxygen. The organism appeared positively aerotactic: cells accumulated
around air bubbles when motile but rapidly lost motility
under a cover slip in the absence of such bubbles. Motility
in a liquid environment was only seen with cells diluted
from swarm plates and was not observed in MH liquid
culture.
High percentage agars
At concentrations of agar above 1% (w/v), aggregates of
hundreds to thousands of cells were able to detach from
the central mass of cells to form rotating groups (vortices)
or were part of the same interconnected pattern (Fig. 2A,
Fig. 3A). Movement rates for entire colonies could be in
excess of 1 cm/h with a rotation rate of up to once every
few seconds. Within the mass of cells distinct whirlpool
patterns and streams were observed. The mechanism of
detachment of entire sub-colonies in this situation

appeared to be primarily withdrawal of cells into the central mass and not simply the colony pulling away. The
position of the colony was essentially static during detachment until the connection was broken with the central
body. Detachment of a sub-colony was preceded by a
mass of cells flowing back into the main colony body (Fig.
3B and 3C).
Effects of extracellular material on motility and pattern
formation
Preparations of the extracellular material from swarming
P. vortex cells contained one or more activities that
affected the motility of entire masses of cells. When a
droplet (10 μl) was delivered ahead of an extending
"snake" body of cells the result was a temporary dispersal
of the cells into the area of the extract (Fig. 4). It was not
clear if the effect was chemotactic or a physical effect, such
as detergent activity. Control experiments (not shown)
demonstrated that toothpick marks in the absence of cell

extract or growth medium did not have the same effect.
When present at < 5% (v/v) in MH agar (1.5% v/v) the
extracellular material had little obvious effect on pattern
formation (data not shown). When tested for detergent
activity, using the drop spreading method, cell extracts
had a greater detergent activity than MH medium alone.
Individual cell morphology and flagellation during
swarming
Measurements of individual cells indicated that P. vortex is
distinctly curved (average 18.6° deviation from a straight
line) compared to B. subtilis 168 (7.1°). The bend in P.
vortex was significantly different to B. subtilis 168 by Student's T-test (P > 0.001, n = 200 for both samples). The
most extreme deviation from a linear cell in P. vortex seen
was 101° (i.e. an acute angle). In contrast, the maximum
bend was only 19° for cells of B. subtilis 168. Measurements of cell length by light microscopy and analysis of
digital images (Fig. 5) suggested that there was a subpopulation of extremely elongated cells to be found within
the swarming population. The elongated subpopulation
was often a minority, at 37°C around 5% of swarming
cells were above 16 μm long. Cell length also increased
dramatically with growth on agar at 42°C, in this situation > 33% of the population was above 16 μm long. In
contrast, elongated cells above 16 μm were not usually
seen in liquid culture but rather appeared to be a feature
of growth on a semi-solid medium.

High percentage agars
A rapid fixation method, combined with the use of
osmium tetroxide to preserve hydrated polymers during
critical-point drying, was used to image swarming bacteria
by SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy). Imaging of rapidly fixed rotating colonies on MH agar (1.5% w/v) was
possible using this technique (Fig. 6A). Colonies were flattened with depressions or troughs and peaks, including
the periphery of the colony. Most notable in these pictures
was the alignment of the curved cells into the vortex or
whirlpool pattern (Fig. 6B). The presence of filaments
extending from the cell surface was notable and ubiquitous for swarming cells (Fig. 6B–C). These filaments were
of dimensions consistent with flagella (< 60 nm wide, > 5
μm long); they showed a strong tendency to be entwined
with those of the near neighbors (Fig. 6C) that may indicate an unusual degree of flexibility. Helical bundles, in
which peritrichous flagella from the same cell aggregate
into a single rotating mass to drive motility of a cell, were
never observed in swarming cells [2]. The density of filaments was similar in the elongated subpopulation when
grown at 37°C or less, 2 to 8 flagella per μm of cell length.
Examination of all positions in motile P. vortex swarms
gave the same result; the entire colony was covered in a
network of these entwined filaments. The filaments
resembled the lateral flagella of Aeromonas [60]. As a control, P. mirabilis swarmers were fixed and imaged by the
same method; here helical flagella bundles were seen that
match previous observations [61], which suggests that the
fixation method was able to capture the structure of rapidly swarming bacteria. Flagellar staining and light microcopy confirmed that swarming P. vortex was peritrichously
flagellated with numbers and lengths of flagella consistent
with the SEM images (Fig. 7B). Liquid growth led to the
loss of both flagella and motility (Fig. 7C). On the basis of
these data we conclude that we are viewing bacteria which
develop peritrichous or lateral flagella when swarming on
a surface.

Low percentage agars
Light microscopy of swarming on MH (0.3% w/v) agar
lead revealed similar arrangements of flagella and distribution of cell lengths and curvature to that found on
higher percentage agars (Fig. 7A).

Tracking of the dispersal of an antibiotic resistant mutant
within macroscopic colonies
P. vortex was found to be RIFS (rifampicin sensitive) when
tested on MH agar (0.3 to 2% w/v agars) using antibioticcontaining Neo Sensidisks, which produced zones of
clearing of c. 12 mm in the bacterial lawn. Spontaneous,
RIFR (resistant) colonies of P. vortex were obtained at a frequency of 1.7 × 10-9 when selected on MH plates (1.5% w/
v agar) containing 50 μg/ml RIF. This was a similar frequency to the occurrence of spontaneous RIFR in B. subtilis

0.5 to 9 cm in diameter on MH agar (0.3% w/v), of the
wild-type strain were seeded with an actively motile RIFR
strain (from another swarm plate with the same percentage of agar) at specific locations. After 1–20 h replica plat-

ing was used to sample locations within the wild-type
colony for the arrival of representatives of the RIFR strain.
Control experiments, replica plating RIFS colonies, indicated that colonies without the RIFR strain did not produce RIFR colonies sufficiently often to confound this
method of analysis.

extension. Spreading right across the Petri dish was still
possible when the inoculation was made 12 h after the
colony had reached the edge of the dish (Fig. 8C). Spread
was reduced to a few centimeters at most (assaying 12–36
h) from the inoculation point when the inoculation of the
RIFR strain was made 24–36 h after the RIFS strain reached
the edge of the Petri dish (Fig. 8C). The replica plating
method also indicated that the RIFR strain was spreading
by most or all available paths, i.e. generally through the
complex network formed by the RIFS strain rather than via
a specific or limited set of routes. These data support the
concept that a single, macroscopic colony is formed on
low percentage agars with the potential for the efficient
exchange of cells between distant locations. These results
were supported by transmission microscopy of colonies
directly on Petri dishes, which suggested that multidirectional streaming was a general feature of colony dynamics

Low percentage agars
Rapid spread of the RIFR strain occurred throughout the
colony (Fig. 8). The only exception was that inoculations
in the absolute center of the colony were less reliable in
facilitating migration of the RIFR strain than those made
0.5 mm away from the center (data not shown). Spread
was identical whether the resistant strain was inoculated
near the center of a plate with the sensitive strain or 5 h
after (Fig. 8A). Inoculation of swarming colonies when at
a 30 mm radius (i.e. still actively spreading), allowed reisolation of the RIFR strain at both the periphery and interior of the colony 3–8 h later (Fig. 8B). Both outwards and
inwards movement appeared to be occurring with similar
efficiency. Inoculation at the periphery of a Petri-dishwide colony resulted in efficient spread of the RIFR strain
across the 9 cm plate within 8 h. Intra-colony migration of
cells in this situation occurred at a similar rate to colony

during colony expansion, and up to 12–24 h after the
leading edge reached the Petri dish wall.
High percentage agars
On higher percentage agars spread of the RIFR strain was
also observed and all inoculation points within a Petridish-wide colony allowed access to essentially all other
locations within a 4–12 h period. However, after this time
migration was less effective than on lower percentage
agars and the period in which rapid migration of the RIFR
strain within the macrocolony less sustained (Fig. 8F).
Additionally, there was a greater bias towards outwards
movement: once the colony exceeded 30 mm diameter
the RIFR inoculation tended to spread in an arc of c.
220–300 degrees, i.e. in most directions except directly
inwards (Fig. 6E). As with migration of the RIFR strain on
lower percentage agars, regions to which the RIFR strain
did spread were completely colonized. These data suggest
that exchange of cells between rotating colonies, even
when apparently separated, was relatively commonplace.
Effect of PNPG on swarming motility
Addition of PNPG (p-Nitrophenylglycerol, 0.5 mM) to
MH plates (1 to 1.5% w/v agar) delayed the initiation of
swarming by 4–8 h. In liquid culture this concentration
was not inhibitory to growth (doubling time 27 min without PNPG, 29 min with 0.5 mM in MH broth at 37°C).
Higher concentrations were inhibitory growth. PNPG at
0.5 mM is sufficient to inhibit Proteus swarmers as is used
as such within clinical microbiology laboratories to limit
this organism in diagnostic assays on agar [63].
Effect of mitomycin C on cell morphology and swarming
motility
Mitomycin C (MitC), a DNA damaging agent and a strong
trigger for the SOS response [64,65] was used to create
stresses on the swarming cells. When used at concentrations from 0.1 to 0.3 μg/ml MitC did not reduce the
growth rate in liquid culture (doubling time 27 min without MitC, 31 min with 0.3 μg/ml in MH broth at 37°C).
However, MitC did cause filamentation, as would be
expected for any rod-shaped bacteria in which the SOS
response is strongly induced [64,65]. Filamentation was
also seen on solid media but, additionally, more curved
cell morphologies were found, to the extent that loops
could be formed from a single cell.
Low percentage agars
At the microscopic level on low percentage agars it
appeared that unproductive or abortive branches were
being formed that failed to extend far (< 100 μm) from
the parental body in addition to productively elongating
"snakes". The structure of colonial development was more
modestly affected, with abortive side branch formation
being the most common outcome.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/36

High percentage agars
The effect of MitC on swarming was more extreme on
1.5% (w/v) MH agar. Real-time imaging revealed that
even extremely elongated or curved cells were motile in
masses (Fig. 9A,B,D,E). Single isolated cells, when highly
curved, showed "tail chasing" rotation, albeit slowly (<
0.1 rpm). Elongated cells appeared to sometimes move
along tracks in the agar (Fig. 9D). We were not able to
determine whether these tracks were being created by the
cells or whether the cells were effectively moving and/or
elongating to align with preexisting imperfections in the
agar surface. Small groups of 3–20 cells could also show a
rapid (up to several times a second) and quite extraordinary rotation around a common center resembling a
wheel. Examples of two such rotating wheels are shown in
Fig. 9C. In this case there are two rotating groups of cells
with the outer layer of cells non-motile. Rotating wheels
(vortices) were often seen in close contact with nonmotile, more linear cells (Fig. 9). Both clockwise and
counterclockwise rotation was seen within wider fields of
view, but for any given instance the spinning motion was
usually unidirectional and without detectable pausing.
Larger masses of cells formed in a similar fashion to the
rotating colonies seen without MitC but were less coordinated and rarer. Masses often trailed elongated cells (Fig.
9A and 9G) and were generally less rounded than rotating
colonies without MitC. These showed no aversion to
crossing the paths of groups of < 10 cells and their passage
resulted in the alignment of less motile cells. Larger
masses of cells (hundreds of microns across) showed a
very striking vortex pattern; despite the elongated cells the
drive towards rotation of cell masses was strong (Fig. 9F).
At the macroscopic (visible to the eye) level swarming
morphology became coarser and less highly branched as
a result of MitC treatment.
Effect of Congo Red on swarming motility
Addition of Congo Red (100 μg/ml) delayed the initiation
of swarming by 6–8 h on solid media (1.5 % w/v agarose).
Higher concentrations of Congo Red (400 μg/ml) completely inhibited swarming (> 72 h), but still permitted
growth, resulting in round, raised colonies up to 8 mm in
diameter with a ringed edge from drop inoculations and
conventional colonies from streak plating (Fig. 10A and
10C). Examination of cells grown with Congo Red by
light microscopy indicated they were not motile and tannin staining did not reveal flagella when viewed by light
microscopy. SEM images of cells showed an absence of the
filaments observed in motile cells, and an extreme morphology: highly coiled and twisted cells (Fig 10B).

Discussion
P. vortex is a fascinating organism, one with social motility
that is exquisitely sensitive to its environment. Previously
studies have concentrated on the mathematics of pattern

formation, analyzing slowly developing colonies over a
period of days and controlling the quality of the agar substrate precisely to ensure reproducible macroscopic morphologies [16]. Here we have taken a different approach,
one that focuses on imaging and tracking at the cellular
level. The choice of rich medium and low percentage agars
suited real-time observation. High percentage agars permit the observation of greater structure whilst lower percentages permitted longer term imaging without
inhibition of motility, possibly due to a greater resistance
to desiccation.
This is the first detailed description of P. vortex swarming
at the microscopic level. A picture emerges in which
curved cells align into rotating or refluxing masses with
what appears to be rapidly reversible physical coupling
and coordination. The experiments in which a RIFR strain
was seeded into RIFS colonies allowed tracking of the dispersal of cells within colonies. These experiments indicated that P. vortex was able to move within disparate
locations with little bias, suggesting that the complex patterns formed are single colonies with the potential for
communication and spread of cells, across several centimeters. Light microscopy of swarming P. vortex cells stained
for flagella indicated that swarming cells had multiple
flagella. SEM imaging detected filaments, consistent with
the staining experiments and situations in which motility
was observed, and therefore suggesting these were the
flagella. The filaments viewed by SEM did not form helical
bundles but rather tend to entangle or otherwise associate
with those of neighboring cells. In this respect P. vortex
resembles the swarming form of Aeromonas [60] for
which lateral, entangling flagella are important in rafting.

The loose nature of the connection suggested by the dispersion and reformation kinetics of swarming P. vortex
(with dilution and the movement of clumps of bacteria
within larger masses) is consistent with this idea. These
observations suggest a model for the swarming of P. vortex
that involves reversible connections formed by flagella
and that a raft of curved cells can convert the rotation of
individual flagella into the translocation of the entire colony. The loose nature of the contacts could allow a dual
role for flagella in motility and rafting, maintaining the
cohesion of the mass but permitting a degree of rearrangement including the characteristic vortex motion. Preliminary results from the genome sequencing of P. vortex
suggest there is only one flagellar motility system. It is
likely that flagella ids cohesion and drives motility but we
cannot exclude the involvement of other mechanisms.
When cellular masses do part on higher percentage agar, it
is the main body of cells that withdraws. Cell masses can
meet but there is at least a short-term aversion to this
event (Fig. 2D, Fig. 3D) that may promote efficient colonization of a surface without complete depletion of nutrients and therefore facilitate sporulation. In the longer
term, we note that merging of multiple colonies on highnutrient media did occur but that during growth on more
limited nutrients there is a significant aversion to colonies
merging as previously described. It is not clear if physical
or sensory (e.g. negative chemotaxis) or other factors govern these interactions. Experiments with cell extracts
revealed detergent activity that might be due to a surfactant such as surfactin, which is important in B. subtilis
swarming. The dispersal effect (Fig. 4) seen in response to
contact with a cell extract is consistent with this possibil-

BMC Microbiology 2008, 8:36

ity. Preliminary genome sequencing data [66] are also
consistent with the possibility of surfactin synthesis.
Within the mass of cells there may be distinct subpopulations. Morphological diversity was certainly commonplace within swarming cultures. Extremely elongated cells
were a small but consistent fraction of the swarming population. Elongated cells were not hyperflagellated, and
therefore do not resemble the swarmers of Proteus mirabilis, which have an unusually high density of flagella compared to the vegetative form [51]. We also note that under
stress (Congo Red, MitC, elevated temperature) even
more extreme and diverse morphologies (e.g. cells elongated and curved to the point of being twisted) emerged.
The most informative stress was MitC. Preliminary
sequencing data [66] and the visible filamentation suggested that this compound was acting as a trigger of the
SOS response [64,65]. Sublethal doses of MitC resulted in
less coordinated swarming, allowing more detailed observation of small cell masses with extreme morphologies.
The MitC experiments, along with dilution of untreated
motile cells, suggested that motility was a collective phenomenon; it was possible but never rapid in isolated cells.
Additionally, a small number of cells (< 10) were sufficient to trigger the rapid rotational "vortex" movement
that appears to be at the heart of the P. vortex pattern formation. In this situation, motile cells were usually in contact with non-motile cells and multiple foci of rotation
could also be in contact (e.g. Fig. 9). Single cells displayed
limited shunting or rotational movement but it was never
as rapid as seen in collectives of cells, suggesting a genuinely collective or social behavior.
Two compounds were identified which limited swarming.
One, Congo Red, is known to modulate a wide variety of
motile behavior in bacteria, including gliding and flagella-mediated swarming [27]. Congo Red has multiple
effects on cell surfaces and can interfere with gliding and
flagellar motility [67]. Growth of P. vortex with Congo Red
led to loss of motility and increased growth within the
center of the inoculation and a subpopulation cells with
extreme twists. Previous workers have suggested that the
formation of a ring structure by B. subtilis is independent
of motility [68]. For P. vortex this appears only partially
true; a ring colony (on high percentage agars, Fig 10C) certainly does form in the absence of motility. But swarming
appears to play a role in evacuating the center of the colony as well as outgrowth from the outer edge of the inoculation. A second inhibitor of P. vortex swarming, PNPG,
is also a retardant of Proteus mirabilis swarming and is
effective against P. vortex at a similar concentration (0.5
mM). This may imply parallels between these two phylogenetically quite distinct organisms. Both PNPG and
Congo Red have a practical utility in facilitating conventional single colony microbiology of P. vortex. Addition-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/36

ally, mutants that overcome these inhibitors are likely to
be valuable in understanding the mechanism of swarming.
Finally, there is the question as to the practical applications of pattern formation in bacteria beyond being a
model system for processes such as complex cellular
organization. One possibility is in the patterning or construction of microscale devices where the structure must
be constructed according to flexible rules rather than an
exact template [69]. Secondly, P. vortex is exquisitely sensitive to changes in its environment and alters its pattern
formation visibly with very subtle environmental
changes. This might be an interesting method for monitoring environments that must be kept extremely consistent. Thirdly, we note that complex pattern formation is a
property rapidly lost with laboratory culture but is one
sometimes found in recently isolated pathogens including
Paenibacillus alvei [16,56]. We speculate that it may therefore be of advantage in infections, as quorum sensing has
already been found to be [40,41]. Antimicrobials targeted
against complex social behavior, i.e. quorum sensing, are
already in development. Paenibacillus as a model system
may allow new targets limiting "antisocial" behavior to be
identified.

Conclusion
P. vortex in a bacterium which swarms on nutrient agars to
form intricate, extended colonies, within which individual cells have considerable ability to relocate. Cell morphology, vigorous motility (apparently driven by flagella)
and interactions between moving masses of cells are
important factors in the dynamic architecture of these
complex colonies. This work represents an in-depth examination of bacterial cooperative organization from the cell
up to the colony level. The results may give important
clues about bacterial strategies of cooperative adaptability
to environmental stresses. P. vortex provides a valuable
model for biocomplexity and the self-organization of biological systems in general.

Methods
Culture
Liquid culture of P. vortex was in Mueller Hinton (MH,
from Oxoid, UK) broth at 37°C with vigorous shaking.
Growth in liquid culture was measured as OD595 using a
Hitachi U-1500 spectrophotometer. For swarming, MH
agar plates (see Results for agar concentrations) were
poured with 20 ml of medium and were allowed to solidify whilst covered with sterile filter paper to ensure a consistent thickness and unblemished surface without air
bubbles or drying patterns. Congo Red, Mitomycin C and
PNPG (all Sigma, NL) were dissolved in distilled water,
filter sterilized and added to liquid growth medium, or to
MH agar just before pouring, at the appropriate concen-

trations. Inoculations for swarming were made by depositing a 10 μl drop of an overnight culture grown in MH
broth onto the center of a MH agar plate and incubating
for 5–60 h at 37°C. Multiple inoculations were made on
the same plate to look at the interactions between colonies. Cells were not subcultured indefinitely, every two
weeks a new culture was grown from stocks stored at 80°C.
Light microscopy and imaging of motility
Organisms swarming on the surface of nutrient agars were
imaged by transmission light microscopy using an Olympus BX41 microscope with a total magnification of
40–500 fold (Olympus, Japan). A heated microscope
stage (Marzhauser, Germany) was used to incubate plates
during real-time imaging. Image capture was by Kappa
CCD camera. Image analysis and the compilation of
stacks of still images into movies was with ImageJ software [70]. Addition of compounds to swarming cells was
performed manually with a sterile toothpick targeted by
low-power microscopy. A Leica DSZ binocular microscope (Leica, NL) with an intrinsic digital camera was used
for low magnification (8 to 40 fold) imaging.
Scanning electron microscopy
Organisms actively swarming on the surface of MH agar
were rapidly fixed in situ for imaging by scanning electron
microscopy (SEM). This was done by excising a 3 × 3 mm
area of interest with a razor blade, placing the fragment in
an empty Petri dish and surrounding the agar fragment on
all sides (except the upper surface) with MH broth containing 3 % (v/v) glutaraldehyde (Fluka, NL). After 2 h fixation, followed by three washes in MH broth, the samples
were incubated for 15 min in 1 % (w/v) osmium tetroxide
to preserve extracellular polymers. Dehydration with ethanol, critical point drying and imaging were performed as
previously described [71]. Additionally, a paraformaldehyde/glutaraldehyde vapour fixation method was used for
as a control for fixation artifacts [61].
Preparation of extracellular material from swarming cells
Inoculations of P. vortex were made onto MH agar (1.5 %
w/v) plates as above then: (a) 12 plates with swarms from
6 to 8 cm in diameter were incubated for 14 h, after which
all areas of microbial growth (viewed by microscopy)
were highly motile and (b) 12 plates were incubated for
60 h, after which the swarm had reached the edges of the
Petri dish and motility had completely ceased. Preparations of extracellular material were made from both original sets of Petri dishes by harvesting the cells in 1 ml of
MH broth per plate and pooling preparations made under
the same condition. Harvested material was centrifuged
twice to clear the cells (4500 g); the supernatant was filtered through a 0.22 μm filter and stored at -80°C in individual aliquots. A mock harvesting was made from 12 MH

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/36

plates without inoculation as a control. Filtered medium
from overnight (o/n) liquid cultures was also prepared.
The resulting cell-fee supernatants were tested in three
ways: (a) 1% (v/v) of the preparation was added to 1.5%
(w/v) agar MH plates, then 10 μl of an o/n P. vortex culture
was inoculated in the center and the plates were incubated
at 37°C; (b) a P. vortex o/n culture was pelleted by centrifugation (4500 g) and resuspended in an identical volume
of supernatant, then 10 μl aliquots were inoculated onto
1.5% agar (w/v) MH plates which were incubated at
37°C; (c) detergent activity was determined, as described
below.
Detergent activity assays
The detergent activity of extracts was tested using a drop
spreading method [72]. Briefly, this was done by spotting
15 μl droplets of water containing 1% (v/v) toluidine blue
onto 1 mm thick films of 1 % (w/v) low melting point
agarose (Invitrogen, NL) and observing the spreading
properties. The agarose contained extracellular material
from swarming cells (10% or 50% v/v) or 108 cfu of cells
(after washing twice in MH medium), or as controls MH
medium or detergents at known concentrations.
Tracking of the dispersal of antibiotic-resistant mutants
within colonies
A spontaneous rifampicin resistant mutant of P. vortex was
isolated from the parental strain in a similar fashion to
mutants selected for in B. subtilis [62]. MH agar (1.5% w/
v) containing 50 μg/ml rifampicin (Sigma, NL) was used
to select rifampicin-resistant (RIFR) mutants. One such
RIFR mutant was selected and used to track the dispersal of
this variant through a wild-type colony. Macroscopic colonies of wild-type (RIFS) P. vortex were inoculated with
approximately 104 cfu of motile RifR mutant from another
MH plate using a sterile toothpick. For each experiment a
single inoculation point was chosen for the RIFR strain at
different locations and stage of development of the wildtype colony. After 1–20 h further incubation at 37°C the
pattern on the plate was replicated using a sterile velvet
pad onto fresh MH with and without RIF (50 μg/ml) and
cultured for 16 h at 42°C to limit swarming. The pattern
of growth on the replica RIF plate was used to assess the
degree to which the mutant strain penetrated the network
of the wild-type colony.
Flagella staining
Staining of flagella was preceded by gentle transfer of
swarming cells into drops of water or into warmed MH
medium on a microscope slide using a sterile toothpick.
Staining was by the tannic acid/crystal violet protocol of
Heimbrook and coworkers [73] with examination of flagella by transmission light microscopy.

The sequencing is performed using 454 technologies. Preliminary results using TIGR annotation of the contigs identified by sequencing indicate that the genome comprised
about 6,800 open reading frames (ORFs). The results also
indicate the existence of surfactin synthesis related genes as
well as the existence of 42 flagella-related genes and several
key chemotaxis-related genes including CheA, CheC, CheD
and CheW, which are organized in 6 operons. In regard to
the SOS response we have identified homology with several
key SOS genes such as RecA, LexA, DinB, UvrA and Uvr B.
The sequencing effort is conducted under the Tauber Initiative at Tel Aviv University in collaboration with GeneBee
