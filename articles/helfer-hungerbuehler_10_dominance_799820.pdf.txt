Abstract
Background: In a cat that had ostensibly recovered from feline leukemia virus (FeLV) infection, we observed the
reappearance of the virus and the development of fatal lymphoma 8.5 years after the initial experimental exposure
to FeLV-A/Glasgow-1. The goals of the present study were to investigate this FeLV reoccurrence and molecularly
characterize the progeny viruses.
Results: The FeLV reoccurrence was detected by the presence of FeLV antigen and RNA in the blood and saliva.
The cat was feline immunodeficiency virus positive and showed CD4+ T-cell depletion, severe leukopenia, anemia
and a multicentric monoclonal B-cell lymphoma. FeLV-A, but not -B or -C, was detectable. Sequencing of the
envelope gene revealed three FeLV variants that were highly divergent from the virus that was originally
inoculated (89-91% identity to FeLV-A/Glasgow-1). In the long terminal repeat 31 point mutations, some previously
described in cats with lymphomas, were detected. The FeLV variant tissue provirus and viral RNA loads were
significantly higher than the FeLV-A/Glasgow-1 loads. Moreover, the variant loads were significantly higher in
lymphoma positive compared to lymphoma negative tissues. An increase in the variant provirus blood load was
observed at the time of FeLV reoccurrence.
Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that ostensibly recovered FeLV provirus-positive cats may act as a source of
infection following FeLV reactivation. The virus variants that had largely replaced the inoculation strain had
unusually heavily mutated envelopes. The mutations may have led to increased viral fitness and/or changed the
mutagenic characteristics of the virus.

Background
Domestic cats are natural hosts to feline leukemia virus
(FeLV) [1] and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) [2].
These retroviruses can induce tumors and immunosuppression. While FIV-infected cats usually become persistently infected when exposed to the virus [3], the
susceptibility of cats to FeLV infection varies remarkably
[4]. FeLV infection has been shown to result in different
outcomes, which makes FeLV-infected cats an appropriate animal model for the multifaceted pathogenesis of
retroviruses [4]. Some cats develop progressive infection

with persistent viremia and a lack of FeLV-specific
humoral and cellular immunity [4,5], and they ultimately
succumb to FeLV-associated diseases. The majority of
FeLV-exposed cats develop a regressive infection with
undetectable or transient viremia and an effective
immune response [5]. In some of these cats, localized
FeLV infections have been demonstrated [6,7]. Latent,
nonproductive infection characterized by the absence of
viremia and the persistence of the virus in the bone
marrow can be identified in cats following regressive
infection. This viral persistence can be detected by culturing bone marrow cells in the presence of corticosteroids [8-11]. The majority of cats with latent infection
eliminate the virus from the bone marrow within 30
months of exposure to infection [11,12].

The development of sensitive and specific real-time
TaqMan polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays [13-15]
led to the reassessment of FeLV infection outcomes
[14,16-18]. In these studies, cats with progressive infection became persistently positive for the provirus and
viral RNA and had high viral loads. Cats with regressive
infection had lower provirus and viral RNA loads than
cats with progressive infection. The provirus became
undetectable over time only in a few cats with regressive
infection [14].
We now report on a specific pathogen-free (SPF) cat
that had been part of an early FeLV vaccination study,
which was performed to test the first recombinant FeLV
vaccine and to examine the influence of a preexisting
FIV infection on the immune response and vaccine efficacy [19]. The cat had been infected with FIV prior to
FeLV vaccination and exposure to FeLV-A/Glasgow-1.
The cat developed transient FeLV viremia but was
FeLV negative thereafter. After being healthy for 8.5
years, the FeLV antigen and viral RNA reappeared in
the blood; FeLV was shed via the saliva; and the cat
developed a multicentric FeLV-positive lymphoma. The
goals of the present study were to investigate the recurrence of FeLV in this cat and to determine the molecular characteristics of the progeny viruses and their
distribution in order to provide further knowledge on
the molecular determinants of FeLV pathogenicity and
to deepen our understanding of the host-retrovirus
interaction.

Methods
Animal, virus exposures and long-term follow-up

A female SPF cat (cat #261; Ciba Geigy, Basel, Switzerland), which was kept under barrier conditions and
housed in a group, was intraperitoneally infected with
FIV at the age of 17 weeks (Fig. 1A), as described [19].
The cat was vaccinated with a recombinant FeLV p45
protein vaccine (Leucogen, Virbac, Nice, France) at the
age of 41 weeks (Fig. 1B), and it was exposed intraperitoneally to FeLV-A/Glasgow-1 18 weeks later (Fig. 1B)
[19]. At the age of four years (2.9 years post FeLV infection [p.i.]), the cat was revaccinated twice with the FeLV
vaccine (Fig. 1B). The cat was observed for 8.5 years p.i.,
for a total observation period of 9.6 years. It was cohoused with FeLV p27-positive cats during the first
seven years p.i., after which it was kept with p27-negative cats. The study was officially approved by the veterinary office of the Swiss Canton of Zurich (197/89, 43/
90, 66/91, 131/91, 329/91, 56/95). Complete hemograms
and, at selected time points, serum biochemistry analyses were performed. CD4+ and CD8+ cell subsets were
determined by flow cytometry as described [20], starting
twenty months after FIV infection at the age of two
years.

Serological assays and virus isolation

ELISA was used to detect the levels of the FeLV p27
antigen [21] and antibodies to the FIV transmembrane
protein [22], total FeLV, and FeLV p45 [19,23]. ELISA
results were calculated as a percentage after normalization to the positive control, which was assayed on every
plate. FeLV-neutralizing antibodies were measured by a
focus-inhibition assay [19]. Virus isolation was performed for FIV using blood lymphocytes [19,23] and for
FeLV using heparinized plasma [19]. To detect FeLV
latency, bone marrow that was collected 24 weeks p.i. at
the age of 1.6 years was cultured in the presence of
hydrocortisone [19].
Necropsy

The cat underwent histopathological examination, and
samples from 27 tissues (Table 1) were collected. Tissues for histology were fixed in 10% buffered formalin
and processed by standard procedures. Samples for PCR
analyses were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored
at -70°C.
Immunohistology

FeLV proteins were detected in formalin-fixed paraffinembedded (FFPE) tissue sections by an indirect immunoperoxidase assay (IPA) using antibodies directed
against p27, gp70 and p15E as previously described
[24,25]. Controls were established with a monoclonal
antibody directed against an unrelated antigen. FFPE
lymphoma-positive tissue sections (sternal and mesenteric lymph nodes, large intestine, spleen and liver) were
tested to identify B and T cells using a CD3 T-cell marker (M7254, DAKO) and the B-cell markers for CD79
(M7051, DAKO), CD20 (RB-90-13-P, Labvision, Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Fremont, USA) and CD45R [26] (clone
B220 [Ly5]; Linaris, Wertheim-Bettingen, Germany)
together with the ChemMate detection kit (K5003,
DAKO).
Nucleic acid extraction

DNA from 200 μL of saliva or buffy coat that was collected from EDTA-anticoagulated blood was extracted
using the QIAamp Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hombrechtikon, Switzerland). RNA from serum and saliva samples
that were collected at the time of euthanasia was
extracted using the viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen). Tissue
samples were homogenized as described [27], and DNA
was extracted using the QIAamp DNA Tissue Kit (Qiagen). RNA from tissues was purified using the ABI
Prism 6700 Automated Nucleic Acid Workstation
(Applied Biosystems, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) or the
RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Nucleic acids were extracted
from urine (200 μL) and feces (~5 mg) collected at the
time of euthanasia as described [28,29]. Negative

extraction controls consisting of phosphate buffered saline were included with each batch. In those experiments
for which complementary DNA (cDNA) levels are given,
the isolated RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA
using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription
Kit (Applied Biosystems) prior to real-time PCR.

[13]. Tissue viral loads were determined from cDNA
using the U3 real-time PCR assay and were normalized
to GAPDH and ribosomal protein S7 (RPS7) cDNA
copy numbers [27]. Viral RNA loads in the serum and
saliva were calculated as copies per mL.
FIV provirus and viral RNA loads

Total FeLV provirus and viral loads

Total FeLV provirus loads were quantified by TaqMan
real-time PCR (U3 region) [15]. The number of provirus
copies per cell was calculated using feline glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) copy numbers [30,31]. Ten blood samples that were collected
from 7.3 to 8.5 years p.i. (at the age of 8.4 to 9.6 years)
were available for quantitative analyses. Two samples
that were collected at 4.5 and 6.4 years p.i. (at the age
of 5.6 and 7.5 years) were analyzed by nested FeLV PCR

FIV provirus loads were determined by quantitative TaqMan real-time PCR [32]. FIV RNA loads were quantified
using a protocol [15] and oligonucleotides previously
described [32]. They were normalized according to
GAPDH mRNA loads as determined by real-time PCR
using a protocol [15] and previously described oligonucleotides [31]. For absolute quantification, standard RNA
templates were prepared [33] from plasmids containing
either FIV [34] or GAPDH [31] sequences. The standard
RNA was quantified and aliquoted as described [35].

FeLV envelope gene specific real-time PCR assays

FeLV-A/Glasgow-1 envelope gene (env) was quantified
by TaqMan real-time PCR assay as described [5]. In
addition, primers and probes for an env variant-specific
assay were designed using Primer Express software (version 3, Applied Biosystems; Table 2). The PCR reactions
were performed as described [27] using 400 nM primers, and 200 nM of fluorogenic probe (Microsynth,
Balgach, Switzerland).
Linearized plasmid DNA containing the appropriate
envelope gene sequence (Table 2) was used as a standard template to test the specificity and sensitivity of
the two env-specific real-time TaqMan assays and for
absolute quantification. Copy numbers were determined
spectrophotometrically (Nanodrop® ND-1000, Witec,
Littau, Switzerland), and ten-fold serial dilutions were
prepared as described [33]. The sensitivity of the system
was determined by an endpoint dilution experiment
[33]. The specificity was tested further with an endogenous FeLV sequence standard containing 108 copies/reaction [36] and with DNA from three SPF cats.
Detection of FeLV subgroups

FeLV-subgroups were investigated in the kidney, spleen,
rectum, diaphragm, thymus, mandibular gland and myocardium by conventional PCR using the FeLV-A specific
primers RB59 and RB17, the FeLV-B specific primers
RB53 and RB17 and the FeLV-C specific primers RB58
and RB47 as described [37,38].
In situ hybridization

Digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes recognizing gp70 and
p27 were used for in situ hybridization [39]. The probes

Page 5 of 17

were constructed from FeLV-A [GenBank: M18247] [40]
using the primers listed in Table 2. The PCR products
were cloned using the TOPO TA Cloning kit (Invitrogen BV, Groningen, The Netherlands). In vitro reverse
transcription of the linearized plasmids and digoxigenin
labeling was performed using the DIG RNA Labeling
Kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany).
Positive strand RNA was used as a negative control.
Hybridized digoxigenin was visualized with 150 U of
anti-digoxigenin AP Fab fragments (Roche Diagnostics
GmbH) and nitroblue tetrazolium chloride/5-bromo-4chloro-3-indolyl phosphate.
Sequencing of the env and long terminal repeat (LTR)
regions of FeLV progeny viruses

For the analysis of the full-length FeLV env sequences,
DNA from the kidney and spleen was amplified as
described [29] using env variant primers yielding a 2’664
bp product (Table 2). PCR products were either
sequenced directly (Synergene Biotech GmbH, Schlieren,
Switzerland) or after TOPO TA cloning. Three env variants were identified: KI261-I from the kidney (direct
sequencing), KI261-II from the kidney (direct sequencing) and spleen (2 clones) and SP261-III from the
spleen (19 clones).
Full-length U3 regions of the 3’ LTR were amplified
using the forward primer CAA TAC GAT CCG GAC
CGA CCA TG and the reverse primer CGG GGC GGT
CAA GTC TCG GCA AAG (adapted from [41]). PCR
products (446 bp) were cloned as above. A total of 18
FeLV LTR clones, including 7 from the kidney, 3 from
the bone marrow, 3 from the liver and 5 from the
spleen, were sequenced (Microsynth).

Phylogenetic analyses

Results

Phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses were
conducted using MEGA version 4 [42]. The FeLV surface unit (SU) and the LTR sequences were aligned
using CLUSTAL W [43]. For SU sequences, bootstrap
support (1,000 replicates) was calculated by the neighbor-joining (NJ), minimum evolution (ME) and maximum parsimony (MP) methods, and results > 70% were
considered to be significant [44]. MP trees were
obtained using the Close-Neighbor-Interchange algorithm [45] with search level three [44], in which initial
trees were obtained by the random addition of
sequences (10 replicates). All positions containing gaps
and missing data were eliminated from the dataset
(complete deletion option).

Long-term follow-up

Assessment of clonality in the lymphoma

To assess the clonality in the lymphoma from cat #261,
the variable region genes of the feline immunoglobulin
heavy chain (IGHV) and the T-cell receptor gamma
(TCRG) were analyzed using PCR for antigen receptor
gene rearrangements (PARR). To this end, DNA
extracted from snap-frozen tissues was evaluated as
described [46,47]. In addition, FFPE samples were analyzed without preceding DNA extraction: single 10 μm
sections were treated with 20 mg/mL of proteinase K in
150 μL 1× Phusion HF Reaction Buffer (BioCat, Heidelberg, Germany) at 60°C overnight. After inactivation of
the proteinase and centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 2
minutes, the fluid phase was used to confirm the DNA
quality as described [48] with Phusion DNA Polymerase
(BioCat). The samples were assayed by IGHV PARR
analysis as described [48] with the following modifications: sense primers with annealing sites within the
same framework region (1 and 3) were combined in one
reaction (V1FR1 and V3FR1; V1FR3 and V3FR3).
Statistics

Statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad
Prism for Windows (version 4.03, GraphPad software,
San Diego, CA). Differences among three or more
groups were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis one-way
ANOVA by Ranks (pKW) and Dunn’s post test. Differences between two groups were tested for significance
using the Mann-Whitney U-test (p MWU ). Differences
were considered significant if p < 0.05. Observed agreement, expected agreement and Cohen’s kappa coefficient
were calculated as described [49], with kappa values
interpreted as suggested [50].
Nucleotide sequence accession numbers

The sequences described were submitted to GenBank:
env [EU359303 to EU359305] and LTR [FJ613291 to
FJ613296].

We analyzed blood samples collected from cat #261
over an observation period of 9.6 years as well as tissue
samples collected at necropsy to investigate the FeLV
recurrence and the development of virus variants in a
long-term FIV-infected, FeLV provirus-positive, antigennegative cat. The cat remained FIV-infected throughout
the entire study (Fig. 1A), and all blood samples tested
were FIV provirus-positive. Subsequent to the FeLV
exposure at the age of 1.1 year, the cat developed transient FeLV viremia. FeLV virus was isolated from the
blood in week 2 p.i., and the cat was p27-positive in
week 3 p.i. (Fig. 1C). Transiently decreased white blood
cell (WBC) counts were observed in weeks 1 and 4 p.i.
(Fig. 2A), and the cat developed neutropenia (Fig. 2B).
High neutralizing antibody titers were demonstrated by
12 weeks p.i., and total anti-FeLV antibody levels were
persistently high (Fig. 1B). The virus could not be isolated from the bone marrow. Revaccination against
FeLV at the age of four years yielded a marked boost in
anti-p45 antibodies (Fig. 1B) and temporary increases in
the WBC count and the number of neutrophils (Fig. 2A
and 2B). There was no increase in the level of FeLV p27
(Fig. 1C). All tested blood samples were FeLV proviruspositive (Fig. 1D).
Development of disease

At 8.5 years p.i., at the age of 9.6 years, cat #261 became
anorexic and lost weight, which was followed by dyspnea,
dehydration, pale mucous membranes and a painful
abdomen upon palpation. Severe non-regenerative anemia (packed cell volume: 12%; Fig. 2E; hemoglobin 3.8 g/
dL) and severe leukopenia (100 cells/μL; Fig. 2A) were
observed. Due to the low WBC count no differential was
possible at this time. The last WBC differential performed three weeks prior to sacrifice revealed neutropenia (1,066 cells/μL Fig. 2B) and severe lymphopenia (182
cells/μL; Fig. 2C). In addition, CD4+ T cells were depleted
(9 cells/μL; Fig. 2D). At the time of euthanasia, the animal had elevated levels of blood urea (37.6 mmol/L),
creatinine (227 μmol/L), calcium (3.8 mmol/L), potassium (6.3 mmol/L) and phosphorus (2.9 mmol/L). The
urine had a specific gravity of 1.016, and the proteincreatinine quotient (3.50) was elevated. Upon necropsy,
lymphoma was detected in 18 out of 27 tissues by histological examination (Table 1, Additional file 1).
Reoccurrence of FeLV

Simultaneously with disease development, the cat
became FeLV p27 antigen-positive (Fig. 1C; at the age
of 9.6 years). A marked decrease in FeLV-specific antibodies was noted (Fig. 1B). FeLV RT-PCR analysis of

(Fig. 3C and 3D).
Characterization of FeLV progeny viruses

Characterization of lymphoma

A diffuse proliferation of small to predominantly medium sized lymphatic cells was observed. The nuclei were
mostly round, and had a finely to coarsely stippled chromatin. One single central nucleolus or multiple randomly distributed nucleoli were seen (Additional file
1C). Between 10% (liver) and 100% (sternal lymph node)
of the assessed tissues were affected. Based on the histological appearance and according to the WHO Histological Classification of Hematopoietic Tumors of
Domestic Animals [51] a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
was diagnosed. The B-cell lineage was confirmed by
positive staining in immunohistochemistry using the
anti-CD20 and anti-CD45R B-cell antibodies (Additional
file 1D). Anti-CD3 T-cell and anti-CD79 B-cell staining
were negative. PARR analysis of the IGHV using FFPE
tissues (liver, intestine, lymph node combined) with the
framework region 3-specific primers showed a reproducible intensive band in the expected size range (~180
bp) upon heteroduplex analysis; a second weak band
was non-reproducible. These results were corroborated
by the investigation of snap-frozen tissues from spleen
for rearrangements in the IGHV: a reproducible clonal
PCR product of the expected size (~140 bp) within a
background polyclonal smear was detected. No rearrangement of the TCRG gene was observed. Accordingly,
the lymphoma was categorized as a monoclonal proliferation of B cells.
Presence of FeLV and FIV in the lymphoma

Using IPA, FeLV p27-specific reactions were detected in
2 out of 25 tested samples, while FeLV p27 and gp70specific gene sequences were found in 16 out of 25 samples by the more sensitive in situ hybridization (Table
1). When the results of the histological detection of lymphoma and FeLV in situ hybridization were compared,
we observed an agreement of 96% (expected agreement
55%) and a Cohen’s kappa value of 0.91, indicating
almost perfect agreement between these two analyses.
All 27 tissues examined were FeLV and FIV proviruspositive. FeLV provirus loads were significantly higher in
tissues than in the blood (p MWU < 0.0001), and they
were significantly higher in tissues with lymphoma than
in those without lymphoma (Fig. 3A). FIV provirus
loads in tissues with lymphoma were higher when compared to the loads in healthy tissues, but they were not
higher than the loads in the blood (Fig. 3B).
Out of the 27 tissues tested, 93% were positive for
FeLV transcription, and 89% were positive for FIV

No FeLV-B (recombination with endogenous FeLV
sequences) and FeLV-C subtypes were detected by
conventional PCR. Three heavily mutated FeLV-A env
variants were identified that showed 89-92% amino
acid identity with each other and the highest, albeit
modest, resemblance to FeLV-A/Glasgow-1 (for details
see Table 3). Sequence variations were scattered
throughout env and included point mutations in functional domains, such as the variable regions (VRA,
VRB and VRC) and the proline rich region (PRR; [52];
for details see Additional file 2). All potential disulfide
bonds were conserved in the three env variants compared to FeLV-A/Glasgow-1, as was the PHQ motif
that is located in the N terminus of the receptor-binding domain and is critical for triggering virus fusion
[52,53]. In addition, 11 out of 13 potential N-linked
glycosylation sites were conserved when compared to
FeLV-A/Glasgow-1, with two sites being lost. In addition, three new potential N-linked glycosylation sites
were identified.
Phylogenetic analysis conducted by the MP, NJ and
ME methods revealed the presence of a cluster of the
three env progeny variants. In the trees based on
nucleotide as well as protein sequences, the env variant
sequences were most closely related to the original challenge strain FeLV-A/Glasgow-1 (Fig. 4).
Sequencing of U3 led to nine groups of LTR
sequences (Additional file 3). An overall U3 sequence
conservation of 95-97% was found when the fulllength progeny LTR sequences were compared to
FeLV-A/Glasgow-1. Point mutations were found at 31
locations in the LTR sequence between the start of U3
and the TATA box. Several changes were found
within the enhancer framework that comprises the
binding sites for the transcription factors, the leukemia virus factor b (LVb), simian virus 40 core enhancer (CORE), nuclear factor 1 (NF1), glucocorticoid
response element (GRE) and the FeLV-specific binding
motif (FLV-1). There was one insertion and one transition found in the LVb binding site (Additional file
3). Four clones had a point mutation in the CORE.
Mutations were found at two locations within the NF1
binding site, and one of these was detected in all of
the clones. One mutation was located in the GRE
binding motif, and two clones had a mutation in the
FLV-1. Additional mutations were detected at 24 locations outside of these domains, with the majority of
these mutations located upstream of the LVb site. No
duplications of the enhancer or the upstream region

clones that were investigated.
Dominance of env variants

Using standard DNA templates, real-time PCR assays for
the variant and FeLV-A/Glasgow-1 env were shown to be
specific for the respective sequences, without amplifying
endogenous FeLV sequences. The detection limit of both
assays was one copy/PCR, and the amplification efficiency
was 99% for FeLV-A/Glasgow-1 and 98% for the variant.

Provirus of the env variants was identified in all 27 tissues, and the FeLV-A/Glasgow-1 env provirus was
found in 26 out of 27 tissues (Fig. 5A; for details see
Additional file 4A). With the exception of the duodenum, the provirus loads of the env variants were higher
in every tissue than the FeLV-A/Glasgow-1 env provirus
loads, and, when the results from all tissues were combined, a significant difference was found (p WMU <
0.0001, Fig. 5A). Remarkably, the provirus loads of the
env variants were also significantly higher in tissues with

lymphoma than in tissues without lymphoma (pMWU =
0.0168, Fig. 5B), while no significant difference was
found in provirus loads between these two groups for
FeLV-A/Glasgow-1 (data not shown).
Concordant with these observations, the viral RNA
loads of the env variants were higher than the FeLV-A/
Glasgow-1 viral RNA loads in all but three tissues, and
overall the variant env RNA levels were significantly
higher than those of FeLV-A/Glasgow-1 (p MWU <
0.0001, Fig. 5C and for details see Additional file 4B).
Moreover, viral RNA levels of the env variants were significantly higher in tissues with lymphoma than in
healthy tissues (pMWU = 0.0019, Fig. 5D), whereas no
difference was detectable for the levels of FeLV-A/Glasgow-1 env RNA (data not shown and Additional file

5D). These results were confirmed using the ribosomal
protein S7 (RPS7) as an additional reference gene for
the normalization of expression (Additional file 5). RPS7
was among the most stable reference genes tested previously [27].
When blood samples collected over the course of the
last 14 months prior to sacrifice were analyzed, all samples
tested provirus positive for the env variant and FeLV-A/
Glasgow-1. An increase in the env variant provirus load (>
100×) was observed at the time of FeLV reoccurrence,
while the FeLV-A/Glasgow-1 provirus load remained low
(Fig. 5E). No RNA samples from blood were available for
detailed RT-PCR analyses. The FeLV-positive saliva sample collected at the time of sacrifice, tested viral RNA positive for FeLV-A/Glasgow-1 but negative for the env

variants. The feces and urine collected at the same time
point were positive for env variants.

Discussion
We demonstrate the reappearance of FeLV in an ostensibly recovered cat 8.5 years after the initial virus exposure. The SPF cat under investigation was kept in a
controlled environment and was monitored closely
throughout the entire observation period. It was exposed
to a specified prototype FeLV-A strain, FeLV-A/Glasgow-1, after which a regressive infection with clearance
of viremia was demonstrated. Latent FeLV infection,
which is defined as replicating virus in bone marrow
cell cultures supplemented with corticosteroids [8-10],
was undetectable 24 weeks p.i. (at the age of 1.6 years);
additional samples for testing were unavailable. All
blood samples collected during the last 14 months
before sacrifice were FeLV provirus-positive and the
provirus loads in the peripheral blood were low, a characteristic of FeLV provirus-positive antigen-negative cats
[13]. Only at the age of 9.6 years and concurrent with
the reoccurrence of FeLV antigenemia, the blood FeLV
provirus loads increased.
The cat was co-infected with FIV. This virus infection
is frequently used as an animal model for retroviral diseases and in particular AIDS due to the common genus
and the similarities with the human and simian immunodeficiency virus (HIV, SIV). The Swiss FIV isolate
used in this study, FIV Z Ga, led to an AIDS-like syndrome characterized by complete CD4+ depletion, similar to what has been described for FIV Petaluma [2] and
HIV. The breakdown of the immune system in cat #261,
as a result of end-stage FIV infection, and the resulting
loss of the surveillance of FeLV replication was probably
crucial for the reoccurrence of FeLV. Reactivation of
FeLV infection upon experimental immune suppression
in aviremic cats has been reported [9-11,17]. Some of
these cats received high doses of corticosteroids for several weeks to provoke FeLV reactivation. The potential
for reactivation seemed to be associated with the FeLV
isolate [11], and the probability of reactivation decreased
with increasing duration after FeLV exposure. Most cats
were free of reactivatable virus several months after
clearance of FeLV viremia or after the removal from
constant challenge [11,12]. In cat #261, the last potential
exposure to FeLV was 18 months prior to FeLV reactivation. So far, in the absence of iatrogenic/experimental
immune suppression, only a limited number of cases of
reactivation of FeLV infection have been reported
[7,11,14,17]. In some of these cats, natural stress was
thought to be the initiator of reactivation [11]. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first documentation of
FeLV reoccurrence in a cat with immunosuppression
due to FIV infection.

Page 12 of 17

Concurrent with the reappearance of FeLV, the
FIV-infected cat had developed a fatal multicentric
lymphoma. In general, lymphoma is a well-known
manifestation of FeLV infection and is commonly associated with variant viruses [1,54-57]. In cat #261, the
emergence of several distinct FeLV variants has been
demonstrated. Moreover, lymphoma has also been
described in FIV and FeLV co-infected cats [54,58]. As
a result of the co-infection in cat #261, the role of
FeLV and FIV in the tumorigenesis could not be easily
assessed. Using specific real-time PCR assays, the FeLV
progeny env variant loads were quantified relative to
the load of the originally inoculated FeLV-A/Glasgow1. At the time of euthanasia, the progeny viruses were
more abundant than FeLV-A/Glasgow-1, thereby largely replacing the originally inoculated virus. Moreover, the env variant viruses were present in higher
numbers in lymphoma-positive tissues than in healthy
tissues. This was not the case for FeLV-A/Glasgow-1.
These results may indicate that the FeLV progeny
viruses found in cat #261 were relevant to the course
of disease progression. Nonetheless, a strong association was also demonstrated between the presence of
lymphoma and the provirus and viral RNA loads of
FIV in the affected tissues.
The lymphoma was subsequently further characterized using immunohistology and PARR analysis and
was, based on these results, categorized as a monoclonal proliferation of B cells. B-cell lymphomas have
been reported to be the predominant form occurring
during infections with FIV [59-62]. This is in parallel
to HIV and SIV, where the majority of the lymphomas
occurring in infected individuals were of B-cell origin
[63,64]. In FeLV infection both T and B-cell lymphomas, with a predominance of T-cell lymphomas, have
been described [65,66]. In the present case, FIV may
have played an indirect role in tumorigenesis via
immune suppression, which may have led not only to
reactivation of FeLV infection but, independently,
favored the emergence of a tumor cell clone. The role
of the immune dysfunction induced by FIV for lymphomagenesis has been recognized earlier [67]. FIVpositive cats with lymphoma were reported to have
substantially decreased CD4 + T cells, a reduced cellmediated immunity and B-cell hyperactivity [60,67].
This parallels observations for other lentiviruses. HIV1 is generally considered to play an indirect role in
tumor development via immune suppression and cofactors, such as polyclonal B-cell activation; and the
involvement of other infectious agents, notably the
Epstein-Barr virus, have been identified [68]. Only
rarely FIV seemed to have a direct mutagenic potential
[62]. Accordingly, FIV as well as HIV and SIV proviruses have been reported to be only seldom

Helfer-Hungerbuehler et al. Retrovirology 2010, 7:14
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/7/1/14

integrated in the host genome [62,67]. This is in contrast to directly oncogenic retroviruses including FeLV.
In the present study, tumor tissues were positive for
FIV, but since the cat was viremic, the PCR signal
could have resulted at least partially from FIV positive
circulating blood cells.
The outcome of an FeLV infection may depend on the
age and genetic disposition of the cat, as well as on the
virus genotype [4]. FeLV-A is thought to be minimally
pathogenic but highly infectious and present in all natural FeLV infections [69,70]. FeLV-B, -C and -T develop
within the FeLV-A infected cat via mutation, insertion
or recombination events and are associated with the
development of disease [71]. Using subgroup-specific
PCR, only evidence of FeLV-A, but not of any other
FeLV subgroups was found in cat #261. The inability to
detect FeLV-B indicates that no recombination with
endogenous FeLV sequences had taken place. So far
reported FeLV-A isolates obtained from domestic and
wild cats over several decades and across the world
were found highly conserved, sharing over 97% amino
acid sequence identity in the SU gene [29,40]. Remarkably, the SU sequences from the FeLV in cat #261
showed only 86-89% amino acid identity to FeLV-A/
Glasgow-1. This divergence clearly exceeds that so far
found among the members of the FeLV-A subgroup.
Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the closest relationship was to the original challenge strain, FeLV-A/Glasgow-1. At the time of sacrifice, virus isolation for the
detection of replicating virus was not performed; therefore, receptor interference was not tested. The VRA
sequence predominantly determines the receptor specificity [72]. The VRA of the progeny viruses revealed the
highest resemblance to the VRA of FeLV-A/Glasgow-1;
nonetheless a remarkable number of changes were
observed. Recently, small changes in the VRA were
shown to yield an envelope protein that was capable of
using a different receptor [73,74]. However, these studies were conducted using constrained peptides in the
VRA that were different from the naturally occurring
FeLV isolates, and the engineered viruses were capable
of using receptors outside of those traditionally used by
the FeLV-A, -B and -C viral interference groups [73-75].
In gamma retroviruses, the U3 region of the LTR is a
particularly potent viral determinant for pathogenicity.
Changes in the FeLV U3 sequence, including the URE
and the enhancer itself, drastically influence viral
pathogenicity [41,76]. In the case of FeLV-related nonT-cell malignancies or non-neoplastic diseases, only
one copy of the enhancer is typically found, but multiple copies of other regions of the LTR, such as the
URE, have been reported [41,77]. FeLV that has been
isolated from thymic lymphomas, however, contained
duplications of either a partial or the entire enhancer

Page 13 of 17

sequence [78-80]. In FeLV-945, a natural isolate from
a cat with a multicentric lymphoma, a 21-bp tandem
triplication downstream of a single copy of the enhancer was shown to confer a replication advantage and to
accelerate its disease onset [81]. The U3 sequences
detected in cat #261 did not contain any duplication of
the enhancer sequence or any repeats in the URE.
However, point mutations at 31 locations were identified, including mutations in the enhancer region. Interestingly, 12 mutation sites had been described
previously in FeLV-infected cats with lymphoma
[41,77-79], and three additional mutations had been
found in other kinds of tumors [41,77]. These mutations included one point mutation each in the CORE,
the NF1 and the FLV-1 sequences. Thus, the mutations found in the U3 region of the progeny viruses in
cat #261 may be causatively linked to the induction of
the neoplastic disease.
The particularly high divergence of the progeny
viruses from the originally inoculated FeLV-A/Glasgow-1 found in cat #261 may be explained by the long
period (8.5 years) during which the virus had time to
evolve in this cat. This, in turn, may indicate that
minimal viral replication, at a level below the detection
limit, had occurred in cat #261. In cats that have
ostensibly recovered from FeLV viremia, we have
found an association between plasma viral RNA, as a
probable indicator of minimal viral replication in a
sequestered tissue, and FeLV reactivation and tumor
development [17]. No samples were available from cat
#261 to determine plasma viral RNA throughout the
infection. However, antigens expressed at very low
levels would have constantly boosted the specific
immunity, which may be in agreement with the persistently high anti-FeLV antibodies that were detected in
cat #261. The long observation period in cat #261
exceeds the lifespan of most FeLV-infected pet cats,
which often succumb within a few years, e.g. due to
secondary infections. Since cat #261 was kept under
barrier conditions, the risk of opportunistic infections
or accidents was reduced.
At the time of FeLV reoccurrence, cat #261 was shedding FeLV via the saliva and had, therefore, become a
potential source of infection for other cats. Shedding of
FeLV RNA in the saliva has been demonstrated to be a
consistent feature in antigenemic cats [28], and is
thought to be the main transmission route for FeLV [82].
Interestingly, the saliva sample tested negative for the
presence of env variants. In contrast, urine and feces
were positive, albeit at a low level, for the env variants,
indicating that the progeny viruses were shed via these
secondary routes. It needs to be noted that the gastrointestinal and urinary tract, but not the salivary glands,
were lymphoma positive and particularly the urinary

Helfer-Hungerbuehler et al. Retrovirology 2010, 7:14
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/7/1/14

tract showed high env variant provirus and viral loads
whereas the mandibular gland had high FeLV-A/Glasgow-1 viral loads (Additional file 4). We subsequently
tested the cats from the same cohort and co-housed with
cat #261, but none of them tested provirus positive for
the env variants. The fact that no transmission of the env
variants was detectable could be due to the low loads of
the env variants in urine and feces and the presumably
only very short duration of shedding. Alternatively, the
variants may only inefficiently or not be transmittable.
Viruses selected for their replication fitness within a host
during long-term infections may differ from those that
are efficaciously transmitted between hosts.

Conclusions
This is the first study to document the reoccurrence of
FeLV in a cat with immunosuppression due to FIV
infection many years after the initial virus inoculation.
Since FIV is highly prevalent in some countries, we
postulate that this phenomenon could also be observed
in the field. Our results indicate that both FeLV and
FIV were important for the disease development in the
cat under investigation. While FIV may have mainly
contributed via an immunosuppressive effect, FeLV
and/or FIV may have been causally linked with the
tumorigenesis. Cat #261 developed an active FeLV
infection and was shedding FeLV at the time of euthanasia; thus at least part of the FeLV provirus had
remained full-length and replication competent
throughout the long aviremic phase. Moreover, we
quantified for the first time viral loads of the FeLV
challenge strain and the evolved progeny variants using
sensitive, discriminating real-time PCR assays. The
virus variants had largely replaced the inoculated prototype FeLV-A over time. Molecular characterization of
the progeny viruses revealed a high variance in env not
commonly found in the otherwise highly conserved
FeLV-A subgroup. The large number of mutations may
have led to increased viral fitness and/or changed the
mutagenic characteristics of the virus.
