Experimental design and statistical rigor in
phylogenomics of horizontal and endosymbiotic
gene transfer
John W Stiller

Abstract
A growing number of phylogenomic investigations from diverse eukaryotes are examining conflicts among gene
trees as evidence of horizontal gene transfer. If multiple foreign genes from the same eukaryotic lineage are found
in a given genome, it is increasingly interpreted as concerted gene transfers during a cryptic endosymbiosis in the
organism’s evolutionary past, also known as “endosymbiotic gene transfer” or EGT. A number of provocative
hypotheses of lost or serially replaced endosymbionts have been advanced; to date, however, these inferences
largely have been post-hoc interpretations of genomic-wide conflicts among gene trees. With data sets as large
and complex as eukaryotic genome sequences, it is critical to examine alternative explanations for intra-genome
phylogenetic conflicts, particularly how much conflicting signal is expected from directional biases and statistical
noise. The availability of genome-level data both permits and necessitates phylogenomics that test explicit, a priori
predictions of horizontal gene transfer, using rigorous statistical methods and clearly defined experimental controls.
Although specific details of how plastids originated and
spread among eukaryotes remain under debate [1-8],
there is little doubt that extant photosynthetic taxa
evolved through a very complicated process. There have
been several independent primary origins of plastids
from cyanobacterial endosymbionts [9,10], as well as
undetermined numbers of secondary, tertiary, and perhaps higher order endosymbioses involving eukaryotic
to eukaryotic plastid transfer (see [11-13] for reviews). If
hypotheses that minimize the number of endosymbioses
prove correct, plastids also have been lost on numerous
occasions [1,14,15]. Finally, there have been a number of
proposed and documented cases of serial replacement of
endosymbionts from very different taxonomic sources
[16-21].
Regardless of which of these scenarios turn out to be
validated, it is clear that plastid endosymbioses have
remodeled host cell genomes substantially through the
process of “endosymbiotic gene transfer (EGT). EGT is
a special case of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) involving concerted movement of many endosymbiont genes
into the host cell nucleus [22]; its impacts have been

dramatic (Figure 1A). For example, nearly 20% of genes
in the Arabidopsis nuclear genome are derived from the
cyanobacterial ancestor of chloroplasts [23]. Moreover,
only about half of these genes appear to be related to
chloroplast function; the rest either replaced original
eukaryotic homologs or were adapted to entirely novel
functions in the host cell’s metabolism. Overall contributions from EGT vary among photosynthetic taxa [24]
and eukaryotic to eukaryotic EGT is more difficult to
quantify [22], partly because phylogenetic relationships
among major groups remain unclear. Nevertheless, there
is no doubt that large scale EGT has been a feature of
both primary and higher order plastid endosymbioses
[22]. Transferred genes that are not related to plastid
function are of particular interest because many should
remain under strong purifying selection, even if photosynthesis and the plastid itself are lost. Effectively, they
offer the promise of finding “footprints” [25] of lost
plastids or long-term, stable endosymbionts when no
cytological or metabolic evidence remains (Figure 1B).
It has become popular to look for EGT “footprints” in
genomes of heterotrophic eukaryotes, particularly those
from which current evolutionary models suggest plastids
could have been lost. For example, “algal” genes in both
ciliates and oomycetes have been cited as support for

the “chromalveolate” model of plastid evolution
[1,16,26,27]; that is, a single secondary origin of plastids
in the ancient ancestor of a large and diverse assembly
or organisms, with subsequent plastid losses from extant
heterotrophic taxa. Other phylogenomic investigations
of HGT have offered provocative new evolutionary
hypotheses about the reticulate history of eukaryotic
photosynthesis. They also raise novel problems, both
methodological and computational, that require new
analytical approaches; to date, these problems have not
been addressed in most phylogenomic investigations of
HGT/EGT.

The complexity of phylogenetic conflict within
genomes
Searching for possible cases of HGT, or concerted HGT
that could reflect EGT, usually involves an automated
computational pipeline to uncover conflicting phylogenetic signals across the genome [28,29]. Genes that cluster strongly with one or another algal taxon are
interpreted as potential examples of EGT; that is, genes
transferred to the nucleus over a long association
between endosymbiont and host. Because of uncertainties about current models of plastid evolution, and the
unreliability of individual gene trees (see below), genes
from different algal taxa often are counted collectively
as evidence of EGT from a lost plastid [19,26,27].
These kinds of phylogeny-based approaches implicitly
assume that strong support for clustering any given
gene with an algal clade is reliable evidence of gene
transfer from a member of that algal group. When
mining data sets as large and complex as a typical
eukaryotic genome, however, it is essential to consider
alternative phylogenetic models, as well as known
sources of intra-genomic phylogenetic conflict that can
result in aberrant but strongly supported trees [30-32].
A number of potential problems, both biological and
statistical, should be addressed explicitly and rigorously
in genome-wide analyses of HGT, particularly before
hypothesizing new and complicated scenarios like lost
plastid endosymbiosis.
1. Current evolutionary models require further scrutiny

Assumptions of HGT generally are made for genes that
produce phylogenies different from expected relationships of the organisms in question. Expected relationships, in turn, are based on “generally accepted” models
recovered in previous phylogenetic and phylogenomic
studies. Beyond the potential for circular reinforcement
of prior results, there are two major problems with this
approach. First, most popular scenarios of eukaryotic
evolution were developed without consideration of the
enormous impact of endosymbioses on algal and plant

Figure 1 Endosymbiotic gene transfer and other potential
explanations for finding “algal” genes in any given genome. A.
Depicts the complexity of genome remodeling in typical secondary
endosymbioses, particularly the massive transfer of genes from the
primary plastid alga to its new host cell nucleus. Most genes from
the original primary (cyanobacterial) plastid (1P) endosymbiont
already made their way into the primary host nucleus (1Nu) via EGT.
These genes are transferred, in turn, to the secondary host’s nucleus
(2Nu), if they are essential for plastid function. Some genes still
present in the primary plastid genome could be transferred directly
to the secondary host nucleus. Genes from the primary alga’s
nucleus that are not related to plastid function can be transferred
to the secondary host, either replacing original homologs or adding
novel functions to the host’s metabolism. In addition, for as long as
the secondary host was or remains phagotrophic, many additional
“algal” genes could accumulate by more typical HGT from prey
items. Finally, an unknown fraction of genes in the secondary host’s
genome are recovered with algal clades because of phylogenetic,
tree-building artefacts. For more extensive reviews of eukaryotic
EGT/HGT, see references [25,63]. B. Expectation if the secondary
plastid is lost during the subsequent evolution of the algal genome
shown in panel A. “Algal” genes directly related to plastid function
are likely to accumulate null mutations and be lost, but many that
were adapted to functions unrelated to photosynthesis should
remain under strong purifying selection and be retained in the
genome. These genes could represent a “footprint” of the past
endosymbiosis, if they provide a significantly stronger phylogenetic
signal than is expected from other known sources of tree-building
conflicts, such as common HGT or phylogenetic artefacts. C. Panel
shows a nucleus containing a comparable number of genes that
cluster with algal sequences in phylogenetic analyses, but in this
case most represent phylogenetic artefacts and none are from EGT.
It is critical that investigations of EGT be designed to test explicitly
among alternative, plausible explanations for the presence “algal”
genes.

Stiller BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:259

genomes. Consequently, some tree-building signals they
are based upon could result from concerted gene transfers rather than evolutionary relatedness. For example,
recovery of the Archaeplastida or Plantae, comprising
green algae and plants, red algae and glaucophytes in
many phylogenomic studies [33-35] could reflect relationships through endosymbiosis rather than direct descent [3,36]. Likewise, a strong affinity between
Viridiplantae and Stramenopiles recovered through phylogenomic pipelines [16,34,37] could indicate a closer
evolutionary relationship than hitherto recognized, and
not EGT as has been assumed. At this relatively early
stage of eukaryote-wide phylogenomics, strongly conflicting tree-building signals bear consideration as results
that could falsify current phylogenetic models; they
should not be interpreted through an uncritical lens of
one or another preferred scenario.
The second problem with over-reliance on working
models of eukaryotic evolution is that many of them are
poorly supported. Overall resolution of relationships
among major eukaryotic groups remains poor, and there
is a lack of congruity among studies depending on data
sets and methodologies employed. It can require the
cumulative signal from hundreds of genes and tens
thousands of aligned positions to recover strong support
for nodes that are fundamental to understanding relationships among major photosynthetic lineages
[33,35,38]. For some key relationships, there is no current consensus. As mentioned above, a number of presumptions of EGT have been based on the
“chromalveolate” model of evolution of the red plastid
lineage [14]. Yet “chromalveolates” never have enjoyed
clear phylogenetic support [4,7,39], and some of the largest and best-resolved phylogenomic studies to date
[38,40,41], as well as the few studies designed explicitly
to test it [42,43], reject this model of plastid evolution.
Even when key relationships are strongly supported,
major questions remain as to whether the tree-building
signal reflects history or the cumulative effects of biases
within and among genomes [3,44,45]. Current models of
eukaryotic relationships are working hypotheses and
subjects of ongoing controversy, and require further rigorous testing; it is premature to layer major new scenarios of EGT and lost endosymbioses on top of them.
2. The need for objective bases for invoking EGT

Even assuming a given popular model of evolution is
historically accurate, large numbers of algal genes could
have arrived via more pedestrian processes of HGT; for
example, because algae were a common prey item over
long periods of the organism’s evolution. Any phagotrophic ancestor that could have adopted an algal endosymbiont, must also have been eating algae on a regular
basis. There is no obvious threshold for determining

Page 3 of 8

what level of phylogenetic signal implies repeated cases
of HGT versus gene transfer from a lost endosymbiosis.
Consequently, invoking EGT generally is a subjective
decision based on preconceptions about the organism’s
past. When many algal genes were found in the choanoflagellete Monosiga, they were interpreted as likely products of HGT from prey organisms, because no popular
model of evolution assumes plastids were lost from
ancestral opisthokonts [46]. When comparable or fewer
numbers of algal genes were found in ciliates and oomycetes, they were interpreted as evidence of a lost endosymbiosis under an assumption of the “chromalveolate”
model of plastid evolution [26,27]. If phylogenomic
investigations are to be rigorous, scientific inquiries into
EGT and plastid loss, there is a clear need to establish
more objective criteria for determining whether a foreign gene complement is greater than expected from
more typical kinds of HGT.
3. All strong phylogenetic conflicts are not evidence of
HGT

The thorniest problem with a posteriori interpretations
of conflicting gene trees is that differences in evolutionary history are not the only, and perhaps not the predominant source of phylogenetic conflict within any given
genome (Figure 1). Conflicts among individual gene
trees are caused by a variety of stochastic, directional
and as yet unidentified processes [47]; collectively these
lead to phylogenetic artefacts such as the well-characterized problem of “long-branch attraction” [48]. Differences in evolutionary rates and biases in nucleotide,
codon and amino acid compositions have long been
recognized as common sources of phylogenetic artefacts
[31]. Similarities in lifestyle (e.g. autotrophic versus heterotrophic) also can select for genome-level convergence, both in the varieties and sizes of gene families
present, as well as at the levels of nucleotide or amino
acid composition [49,50].
Years of research have demonstrated that individual
gene trees are unreliable, particularly at the great evolutionary distances considered in studies of EGT. The
small subunit (SSU or 16S-like) of the ribosome is the
poster child for the severity of this problem. Considered
the “gold-standard” for two decades of phylogenetic
investigations of the tree of life [51], and incorporated
into basic biology textbooks in the late 1990s, SSU
rDNA trees were found to contain many inaccurate
nodes, often with strong statistical support [52-54]. This
was not because SSU rDNA is a “bad” phylogenetic
marker; in fact, it remains among the most useful individual genes for examining the global tree of life. Rather,
it highlights a consistent problem with sequence-based
trees at deep phylogenetic levels; they generally (if not
always) contain at least some erroneously placed

Stiller BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:259
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/259

branches. This problem is magnified substantially when
conflicting gene trees are considered across whole genome data sets [32].
Some causes of tree-building conflicts, such as compositional biases and rate variation among sites, generally
are factored into model-based phylogenetic approaches.
Problems of covarions or heterotachy (residues in
sequences do not maintain the same relative rates across
sequences and through time) have proven much more
difficult to model accurately, much less to incorporate
into tree-building algorithms [55]. These factors are
implicated specifically as contributing to the difficulties
in resolving relationships among photosynthetic organisms [45,56]. In fact, discrepancies between phylogenetic
models of sequence evolution, versus the biochemical
reality deduced from experimentally solved protein tertiary structures, suggest that few internal nodes should
be considered reliable at the evolutionary distances considered in most studies of EGT [57].
Additional biases in phylogenetic inference can arise
from sampling tendencies of past researchers. For example, it has been shown that total phylogenetic affinity of
a genome to those of distant taxonomic groups can
depend on the relative number of sequences available
from different groups in targeted databases, and that
this similarity can mimic patterns that emerge from
known evolutionary relatedness [43]. Inherent conflicts
among individual gene trees are further exacerbated at
the scale of whole genomes by inaccurate or incomplete
annotation of many sequences, as well as the potential
for external contamination, when incompletely
assembled genomes or EST databases are run through
automated pipelines. While annotation-related factors
probably dampen out of total phylogenetic signal across
a genome, they could strongly impact an unknown fraction of individual gene trees.

What is the significance of finding algal genes in
any given genome?
These cumulative problems associated with large and
complex genomic datasets beg the question, what is the
significance of finding a few dozen or even a few hundred “algal” sequences in a typical eukaryotic genome of
perhaps 15000 genes (Figure 1B-C)? Put another way, if
only one in a thousand of those genes cluster artificially
with an algal sequence, 15 “algal” genes would be
inferred. At one in a hundred, that number would be
150, certainly more than enough to be considered strong
evidence of EGT using current approaches. It could be
argued that either of these numbers overestimates the
potential for directional phylogenetic artefacts. On the
other hand, it is equally valid to assume that both are
underestimates. Either supposition is subjective given
the current state of knowledge about both intra-genome

phylogenetic conflict and broad-scale eukaryotic relationships. At present, there may be no objective way to
distinguish between a strong phylogenetic artefact and
bona fide genetic transfer for any number of individual
genes identified by an automated HGT pipeline.

A more rigorous approach to analyzing signal
from HGT
The inherent uncertainties in gene trees, along with the
sheer number of them associated with a typical eukaryotic genome, make it essential to develop approaches that
distinguish among potential sources of phylogenetic
conflict. To address this problem, genome-level investigations should apply rigorous, hypothesis-based research
plans, and employ clear and explicit statistical tests with
appropriate controls. As an initial contribution toward
developing such approaches, four major criteria should
be considered in future phylogenomic investigations of
EGT/HGT:
1. A posteriori interpretations of genome-level conflicts
among gene trees should not be considered completed
scientific studies

Clear a priori hypotheses should be in place before an
analysis is undertaken. They should include specific predictions that distinguish among competing hypotheses
(Figure 2A). For example, the chromalveolate model of
plastid evolution predicts that “algal” genes from EGT
(those unrelated to plastid function) should be shared
between ochrophyte algae and their heterotrophic relatives like oomycetes and labyrinthulids. In contrast, an
endosymbiosis only in ochrophytes predicts that phylogenetic signal from EGT should not be shared with
these other groups. A recent statistical test of these two
conflicting models rejected the hypothesis that “red
algal” genes present in either diatom or oomycete genomes are shared between the two [43]. In cases where
automated pipelines uncover strong new intra-genomic
tree-building conflicts, these should be investigated
using similar approaches that distinguish clearly between
EGT and other reasonable explanations. New and complicated evolutionary models based only on gene tree
conflicts should not be advanced without explicit experimental attempts to falsify them.
2. Phylogenetic signal from different algal taxa should
not be grouped together as evidence of a lost plastid

Proposed signal from EGT should be limited to the specific taxon from which it is suspected to have originated.
If enough uncertainty exists among phylogenies to
require clustering algal genes to uncover evidence of
EGT, then these phylogenies also are too uncertain to
be the basis of a complex new evolutionary scenario.
Moreover, whether algal genes from different sources

Figure 2 Testing specific predictions of competing hypotheses to explain conflicting gene trees. A. Patterned after an explicit test of the
chromalveolate model of plastid evolution [43], the two hypothetical scenarios show mutually exclusive predictions about “algal” genes in a
heterotrophic protist’s genome based on two alternative evolutionary hypotheses. The upper scenario of a more ancient endosymbiosis predicts
that genes from the secondary endosymbiont, those unrelated to plastid function, should be shared between the aplastidic heterotroph and its
algal sister taxon. The lower scenario of a later, taxon-specific plastid origin, predicts that “algal” genes from the heterotroph are products of
common HGT or phylogenetic artefacts and, therefore, should not be shared with the photosynthetic neighbor relative to a negative control (C). The control is a taxon generally agreed to be unrelated, phylogenetically or through endosymbiosis, to either the host or endosymbiont
lineages. If the shared phylogenetic signal from the putative endosymbiont is not significantly greater than from the control group, then there is
no objective basis for advancing EGT as an explanation for apparent “algal” genes in the heterotroph’s genome. B. EGT versus HGT in a
heterotrophic taxon. In this case, a rigorous test could be whether there are significantly more “algal” genes in the organism of interest than in
phagotrophic control taxa with no presumed history of EGT. If there is not a significantly greater signal of HGT from the presumed
endosymbiont in the target genome than in the control taxa, then algal genes are consistent with HGT or phylogenetic artefacts and EGT is not
supported. C. The same approach could be used to test whether repetitive HGT is a superior hypothesis to phylogenetic artefacts by examining
control taxa that should have had little to no opportunity to take up DNA from the organism in question, based on their presumed ecological
and evolutionary histories. If it is biologically unreasonable to expect common products of HGT in the control genome (C-), and there is
comparable signal present as in the target genome (T), then HGT does not rise above the null hypothesis of signal from statistical biases and/or
noise across genome-level data.

are interpreted as evidence of one endosymbiosis [26,27]
or multiple, serial endosymbioses [16,19], appears to be
an entirely subjective decision at present.
3. Unambiguous statistical tests should be used to
distinguish among sources of phylogenetic conflict in a
genome

Whole genome data both require and permit new methodological approaches to deal with biases that lead to
strong conflicts among individual gene trees [32]. A
great deal of effort has gone into improving phylogenetic methods to take these biases into account on a
gene by gene basis; however, very little work has focused
on how to employ more classical statistical approaches
that do not rely on modeling unknown or ambiguous
parameters of sequence evolution across the entire genome [32].
Large genomes containing thousands of genes are
tractable data sets for such tests. For example, relative
numbers of individual phylogenies or significant alignment scores can be treated as data in Fisher exact or
other statistical tests of specific predictions of competing hypotheses (Figure 2A-C) [43]. Probabilistic
approaches that examine gene tree concordance across
large, multi-gene data sets also have been used to
examine HGT [58-60], and explicit statistical tests for
EGT could be incorporated into these methods. Likewise, phylogenetic networks [61] rather than tree-bytree interpretations can provide a statistical framework
for examining intra-genomic tree-building conflicts as
evidence of EGT. In addition to permitting direct tests
of explicit evolutionary hypotheses, such statistical
approaches also can account for size variation among
genome data sets, both of the organism under investigation and of those targeted in automated pipelines
[43].
4. Appropriate controls should be employed in all
genome-level investigations of putative EGT

Because conflicts among gene trees are known to arise
from a range of biological processes and statistical biases
[30-32,62], it is essential to frame investigations of EGT
in ways that provide rigorous comparisons of alternative
hypotheses. An example of how to approach this problem would be to use genomes from heterotrophic/phagotrophic groups like choanoflagellates, that is, lineages
believed never to have harbored a plastid, as a control
for expected signal from common HGT (Figure 2B).
Control organisms should be chosen that are unrelated
to either the presumed endosymbiont or the host lineage. If significantly greater numbers of “algal” genes are
present than in control genomes, then EGT is a viable
hypothesis to consider over the alternative (and simpler)
biological model.

Page 6 of 8

As much as possible, control genomes should be chosen that are comparable in size, and likely to have a
similar evolutionary history to the target genome, both
biologically and ecologically. Because organisms vary in
their rates of uptake of foreign genes, no single genome
can provide a standard threshold, past which signal
from concerted HGT is strong enough to indicate something more unusual like a lost plastid. With the coming
availability of multiple genomes from diverse heterotrophic groups, however, it should be possible to define
a mean and distribution of expected signal from more
common forms of HGT, against which proposals of
EGT can be compared statistically.
Although a somewhat more difficult problem to
address, control genomes also should be employed,
whenever possible, when mining whole genome data for
cases of concerted HGT not presumed to be from EGT
(Figure 2C). Organisms for which there is no biological
basis to expect horizontal gene exchange can serve as
controls for phylogenetic conflicts arising from treebuilding artefacts. For example, if the genome from an
exclusively and historically marine lineage contains
genes from similarly exclusive terrestrial organisms, with
no apparent vector between them, then these associations are much more likely to be phylogenetic artefacts
than actual cases of HGT.

Conclusions
The advent of comparative genomics across eukaryotic
diversity necessitates a shift in methodologies applied to
studies of gene transfer. With the amount and complexity of intra-genome phylogenetic signal emerging from
investigations to date, it is critical to apply rigorous tests
of explicit, mutually exclusive hypotheses to explain
conflicts among gene trees. For a typical eukaryotic genome, trees can be found to support any number of different scenarios of concerted HGT, including multiple
serial plastid replacements in many cases. If every
strongly supported but aberrant gene tree is accepted,
uncritically, as a case of gene transfer, inferences of
HGT/EGT will become unfalsifiable hypotheses.
Whether to accept or reject a given scenario as too
complex, or biologically unrealistic, would be an entirely
subjective exercise based on presumptions of individual
researchers. Addressing these issues is particularly
important with respect to EGT, because most current
scenarios of plastid evolution assume that plastids are
much easier to lose than to gain, an assumption that
does not appear to be supported by empirical patterns
of evolution in established photosynthetic lineages
[4,39].
To prevent excessively complex, mutually contradictory, and potentially unfalsifiable scenarios from accumulating in the evolutionary literature, researchers,

Stiller BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:259
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/259

reviewers and editors should insist on rigorous hypothesis testing in genome-level investigations of HGT. The
examples of statistical approaches and controls highlighted here may not be relevant to any given study.
The important mutually exclusive predictions to test,
how statistical tests should be designed, and what control groups are appropriate, will be specific to each individual investigation. It is critical, therefore, that
researchers begin to pay as much attention to hypothesis-based experimental design and new statistical
approaches to analyzing genome level data, as they have
in developing methods to uncover genome-scale conflicts among gene trees.
