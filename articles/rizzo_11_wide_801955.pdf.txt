Abstract
Background: The Anopheles gambiae gSG6 is an anopheline-specific salivary protein which helps female
mosquitoes to efficiently feed on blood. Besides its role in haematophagy, gSG6 is immunogenic and elicits in
exposed individuals an IgG response, which may be used as indicator of exposure to the main African malaria
vector A. gambiae. However, malaria transmission in tropical Africa is sustained by three main vectors (A. gambiae,
Anopheles arabiensis and Anopheles funestus) and a general marker, reflecting exposure to at least these three
species, would be especially valuable. The SG6 protein is highly conserved within the A. gambiae species complex
whereas the A. funestus homologue, fSG6, is more divergent (80% identity with gSG6). The aim of this study was to
evaluate cross-reactivity of human sera to gSG6 and fSG6.
Methods: The A. funestus SG6 protein was expressed/purified and the humoral response to gSG6, fSG6 and a
combination of the two antigens was compared in a population from a malaria hyperendemic area of Burkina Faso
where both vectors were present, although with a large A. gambiae prevalence (>75%). Sera collected at the
beginning and at the end of the high transmission/rainy season, as well as during the following low transmission/
dry season, were analysed.
Results: According to previous observations, both anti-SG6 IgG level and prevalence decreased during the low
transmission/dry season and showed a typical age-dependent pattern. No significant difference in the response to
the two antigens was found, although their combined use yielded in most cases higher IgG level.
Conclusions: Comparative analysis of gSG6 and fSG6 immunogenicity to humans suggests the occurrence of a
wide cross-reactivity, even though the two proteins carry species-specific epitopes. This study supports the use of
gSG6 as reliable indicator of exposure to the three main African malaria vectors, a marker which may be useful to
monitor malaria transmission and evaluate vector control measures, especially in conditions of low malaria
transmission and/or reduced vector density. The Anopheles stephensi SG6 protein also shares 80% identity with
gSG6, suggesting the attractive possibility that the A. gambiae protein may also be useful to assess human
exposure to several Asian malaria vectors.

Background
After more than a century from the discovery of the role
of Anopheles mosquitoes in the transmission of Plasmodium parasites, malaria is still one of the leading causes
of human morbidity and mortality. Currently, the
malaria toll is especially high among young children in
sub-Saharan Africa, where transmission of the most
deadly malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, is
mainly accomplished by two members of the Anopheles
gambiae species complex (i.e. A. gambiae and Anopheles
arabiensis, subgenus Cellia, Pyretophorus Series) and by
Anopheles funestus (subgenus Cellia, Myzomyia Series)
[1]. Proper evaluation of malaria transmission intensity,
of seasonal and temporal variation of vector density and
of the efficacy of anti-parasite and anti-vector control
measures play crucial roles in the framework of antimalaria strategies.
Assessment of malaria transmission intensity is currently based on both parasitological and entomological
measures and a key parameter is the entomological
inoculation rate (EIR), which accounts for human exposure to parasite-carrying mosquitoes. However, entomological measurements are not only expensive and laborintensive but, sometime, also difficult or impossible to
apply: for example in conditions of low transmission
intensity and/or low mosquito density, or for logistic
restrictions. Therefore, additional and/or alternative
methods to evaluate Anopheles density and human
exposure to malaria vectors would be extremely valuable
allowing for epidemiological studies also in settings
where classical entomological methods are of problematic use. During blood feeding, mosquitoes inject into
their hosts a complex mixture of salivary components
whose main role is to facilitate haematophagy by counteracting the haemostatic, inflammatory and immune
responses of vertebrates [2,3]. These salivary components also elicit into hosts an immune response with
production of anti-saliva antibodies. For example, at
least 10-15 protein bands recognized by human IgG can
be detected by western blot using A. gambiae salivary
gland protein extracts and sera from exposed individuals
from a malaria hyperendemic area (B.A., unpublished
observations). Several reports support the concept that
measurement of this antibody response to saliva may
represent an indicator of human exposure to Anopheles
bites and malaria risk, as well as a tool to evaluate efficacy of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) [4-8]. Moreover,
the identification of Anopheles-specific proteins, i.e. not
found in other mosquitoes or blood feeding arthropods,
offers the opportunity to use as markers genus-specific
recombinant salivary antigens instead of saliva [2,9].
This enables for a significant improvement of the methodology increasing both the accuracy and the specificity

by overcoming the need of obtaining large amount of
saliva and potential problems of reproducibility and
cross-reactivity.
Conveniently, vector’s salivary antigens could be used
in parallel to Plasmodium antigens to assess, by serological determination of antibody levels, both exposure
of humans to Anopheles mosquitoes and malaria transmission intensity [10-14]. This immune response to
salivary antigens would represent a direct measure of
intensity of mosquito biting activity on humans, both
at the population and at individual level, and could
provide a few additional advantages. First, it may allow
to assess Anopheles exposure in children, which is presently unworkable for ethical reasons (the method currently in use is based on human landing catches on
adult volunteers). Second, it would be very helpful to
evaluate the impact of anti-vector control measures on
exposure of humans to Anopheles bites. Third, it
would be a tool especially needed for epidemiological
assessments in areas of low malaria transmission,
which are currently increasing as a consequence of the
decline of the malaria burden in several areas of subSaharan Africa [15]. Finally, it might be the appropriate tool to verify if, and eventually to what extent, the
mosquito biting activity is heterogeneously distributed
within a population. Indeed, according to the so-called
heterogeneous biting model, mosquito biting may be
unequally distributed, with few people receiving most
of the mosquito bites (i.e. 20-30% of the population
getting 70-80% of the bites). Heterogeneous biting has
broad implications for malaria epidemiology and control and, as recently suggested, may provide a plausible
explanation for inconsistencies related to malaria
transmission dynamics and modelling [16].
Toward the development of serological markers of
exposure to malaria vectors, attention was focused on
gSG6 (gambiae Salivary Gland protein 6), a small protein initially identified in A. gambiae, where it is specifically expressed in the salivary glands of adult female
mosquitoes [17]. Its specific function awaits full clarification; however, gSG6 must play some relevant role in
haematophagy since its depletion by RNAi increases
probing time and affects blood feeding ability [18].
Afterwards, members of the SG6 protein family have
been identified in the salivary transcriptomes of additional anopheline mosquitoes, but in no other living
organisms, pointing to its genus-specificity and blood
feeding role. Among the few anophelines analysed so far
the SG6 protein is present in species belonging to the
subgenus Cellia (A. gambiae species complex, A. funestus, Anopheles stephensi) and in Anopheles freeborni (a
member of the subgenus Anopheles), but it is notably
absent in Anopheles darlingi, a member of the subgenus

Rizzo et al. Malaria Journal 2011, 10:206
http://www.malariajournal.com/content/10/1/206

Nyssorhynchus and vector of malaria in Central and
South America [18]. This observation suggests that SG6
family members may be widely distributed among the
main African and Asian malaria vectors, but most likely
absent in South American ones.
Given the anopheline-specificity and previous indications of the immunogenicity to humans of gSG6-based
peptides [19], the A. gambiae gSG6 protein was
expressed in recombinant form and the anti-gSG6 IgG
response was analysed in a population from a malaria
hyperendemic area of Burkina Faso. This study provided
experimental evidence that gSG6 may be a good candidate as serological marker of human exposure to A.
gambiae [20], although full validation in different epidemiological settings (i.e. low transmission conditions,
macro-geographic scale) is needed. Moreover, since
malaria is transmitted by multiple and often sympatric
vectors, an ideal salivary marker should allow to estimate exposure to all the major vector species in the
study area. The A. gambiae gSG6 protein is highly conserved among members of the A. gambiae species complex (99% identity with the A. arabiensis homologue,
aSG6), whereas it is more distantly related (80%, 70/87
residues) to the A. funestus protein (fSG6). It is likely
that a certain degree of cross-reactivity to the two protein exists, but the extent of the overlap of the human
IgG response to gSG6 and fSG6 proteins is unknown.
Some indications in this direction have been obtained
using the 23 aa long gSG6-P1 peptide, which encompasses the gSG6 N-terminal region [21]. However, this
peptide is less sensitive in comparison to the whole protein (approx 5-fold) and, therefore, it would be important to experimentally validate the efficacy of using the
antibody response to the gSG6 protein as marker of
exposure to the three main malaria vectors in tropical
Africa. The aim of this study was to evaluate cross-reactivity of human sera from exposed individuals to the
gSG6 and fSG6 proteins. To this purpose the A. funestus
fSG6 was expressed in recombinant form and the IgG
response to fSG6, gSG6 and to an equimolar mixture of
the two proteins was compared by ELISA using sera of
individuals from a malaria hyperendemic area of Burkina Faso.

Methods
Study area and entomological observations

Surveys were carried out in the village of Barkoumbilen
(~35 km NE of Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso), a rural
settlement inhabited by the two ethnic groups Mossi
and Rimaibé. The area was characterized by intense P.
falciparum transmission, mostly linked to the rainy season (from June to October), with entomological inoculation rates >100/person/year. Malaria prevalence was
very high, P. falciparum representing about 95% of

Page 3 of 10

malaria infections, and infection rates ranged, during the
high transmission season, from 60% to 90% according to
age group. Lower prevalences, ranging between 40% and
80%, were observed during the dry low transmission
season. The study protocol was approved by the Technical Committee of the Centre National de Lutte contre le
Paludisme of the Ministry of Health of Burkina Faso.
Oral informed consent for multiple immuno-parasitological, clinical and entomological surveys was obtained
from the Mossi-Rimaibè community living in the village
of Barkoumbilen. A total of 335 sera collected from
individuals of the Mossi ethnic group in 1994 at the
beginning (August ‘94) and at the end (October ‘94) of
the high transmission/rainy season, as well as in the following low transmission/dry season (March ‘95) were
analysed in this study. Sera from 48 Roman citizens (156 years old) who were referred to a city hospital for
routine blood testing were used as a control. Additional
information on samples size and average age for each
survey can be found in the legends to Figures. Entomological measures were based on indoor pyrethrum spray
catches carried out monthly between August and
November ‘94 and in March ‘95 (12 catches/month). A
total of 1,653 female Anopheles mosquitoes were identified: among these 1,479 were members of the A. gambiae species complex (A. gambiae or A. arabiensis) and
174 were A. funestus. Additional details on the study
site and on entomological and parasitological aspects
have been previously reported and can be found elsewhere [22-24].
Protein expression and purification

The A. funestus SG6 protein (fSG6) was expressed as Nterminal His-tagged recombinant protein in the E. coli
vector pET28b(+) (Novagen). Briefly, the region encoding the mature fSG6 protein was PCR amplified using as
template genomic DNA extracted from a single
mosquito collected in 2008 in the Bobo-Dioulasso area,
Burkina Faso. Amplification was performed using the
Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and the oligonucleotide primers G6fu-Nde (5’- GTCTCATATGGAAAAGG
TTTGGGTCGATCG-3’OH) and G6fu-Eco (5’- GTCT
GAATTCTCACTGTTCCAGGAAGGGTTTG -3’OH).
Directional cloning in the NdeI/EcoRI-digested pET28b
vector yielded the pET-fSG6 expression vector, that was
sequenced and then introduced into competent BL21
(DE3)RIL E. coli cells (Stratagene). Expression and purification was essentially performed as previously reported
for the A. gambiae gSG6 protein [20] with few modifications. After overnight growth (37°C, LB medium) 5 ml
of the saturated culture were transferred into 400 ml of
LB medium and grown up to 0.8 OD600 before starting
induction by IPTG (0.1 mM). After 4 hours cells were
harvested and the pellet resuspended in 20 ml of 50 mM

Rizzo et al. Malaria Journal 2011, 10:206
http://www.malariajournal.com/content/10/1/206

Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 50 mg/ml lysozyme and sonicated.
Inclusion bodies (IB) were collected by centrifugation
(15,000 g, 20 min, 4°C), resuspended in extraction buffer
(50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 2 M Urea, 5 mM EDTA, 1%
Triton-X100), washed twice (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 2
M Urea) and centrifuged as above. Proteins from IB were
solubilized by gentle shaking over-night (5 ml of 20 mM
Na2HPO4, 6 M Guanidine-HCl, 0.5 M NaCl, 5 mM Imidazole, pH 8.0), centrifuged (20000 g, 30 min, 4°C) and
subjected to affinity chromatography under denaturing
conditions (HisTrap, GE Healthcare) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Fractions containing the Histagged fSG6 were identified by SDS-PAGE and pooled.
Refolding of this fSG6-enriched fraction was carried out
by rapid dilution in 20 volumes of refolding buffer (100
mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 500 mM L-Arg, 300 mM NaCl, 5
mM L-Glutathione reduced, 0.5 mM L-Glutathione oxidized) and left for 24 h at 4°C with low stirring. After
centrifugation (20,000 g, 30 min, 4°C) the refolded proteins were concentrated by centrifugation in Amicon ®
Ultra (5 kDa MWCO, Millipore), dialyzed against 20 mM
Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and further purified by anion exchange
chromatography (HiTrapQ, GE Healthcare). Elution was
carried out with a linear gradient 0 - 0.5 M NaCl in 18
column volumes. Fractions containing the fSG6 recombinant protein were identified by SDS-PAGE, pooled, concentrated and dyalized against 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0,
150 mM NaCl. Concentration of the purified protein was
estimated by the Bradford Protein Assay (Bio-Rad
Laboratories). The yield of purified protein was of
approximately 6 mg/l, however this is most likely susceptible to improvements since optimization of the procedure for the A. gambiae homologue allowed for higher
recovery (~9-12 mg/l) as previously reported [20].
Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay SG6

ELISA was performed according to standard procedures.
Maxisorp 96-well plates (Nunc M9410) were coated
overnight at 4°C with 50 μl of the A. gambiae gSG6 (10
μg/ml), or the A. funestus fSG6 (10 μg/ml), or with an
equimolar mixture of the two protein (10 μg/ml total)
in coating buffer (15 mM Na2CO3, 35 mM NaHCO3, 3
mM NaN 3 , pH 9.6). After washing (four times) wells
were blocked (3 hrs, RT) in 150 μl of 1% w/v skimmed
dry milk in PBST (PBS Sigma P4417+0.05% Tween 20),
washed again and incubated overnight at 4°C with 50 μl
of serum (1:100) in blocking buffer. Sera were analysed
in duplicate with each antigen and once without antigen
(coating buffer only). Each plate included a two-fold
dilution series (1:40 to 1:2560 final dilutions) of a standard African hyperimmune sera pool. After washing
plates were incubated (3 hrs, RT) with 100 μl of polyclonal rabbit anti-human IgG/HRP antibody (Dako P0214,
1:5000 in blocking buffer). After washing as above the

colorimetric development was carried out (15 min, RT
in the dark) with 100 μl of o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (OPD, Sigma P8287). The reaction was terminated adding 25 μl of 2 M H2SO4 and the OD492 was
determined using a microplate reader (BioTek Synergy
HT). IgG levels were expressed as final OD calculated
for each serum as the mean OD value with antigen
minus the OD value without antigen. OD values were
normalized using the titration curve as previously
described [25]. The normalized ODs were calculated
using the Excel software (Microsoft) with a three variable sigmoid model and the Solver add-in application.
Data analysis

Sera whose duplicates showed a coefficient of variation
(CV) >20% were not included into the analysis. The
mean optical density (OD) of unexposed controls plus 3
standard deviations (SD) was used as cut-off value for
seropositivity. Cut-off values were 0.140 for gSG6, 0.160
for fSG6 and 0.132 for the two antigens combined. Individuals showing OD values above the cut-off level for
seropositivity were classified as responders. Multiple
comparisons were performed by the Kruskal-Wallis test
or, for matched groups, by the Friedman’s test. MannWhitney U test was used to compare IgG levels among
responders of two independent groups. The Wilcoxon
matched-pairs test was used for comparison of two
paired groups. Frequencies were compared by the chisquare test. All statistical analysis was performed using
GraphPad Prism 5.0 ® statistical software (GraphPad
Software Inc., La Jolla, CA).

Results and discussion
Expression and purification of the A. funestus SG6 protein

Taking advantage of the intron-less nature of SG6
family members [18] the region encoding the mature
fSG6 protein was amplified by PCR using A. funestus
genomic DNA as template. Sequence analysis showed
a single non-synonymous substitution (G to C) which
results in an amino acid replacement (K to N) in
position 78 of the mature polypeptide in comparison
to the previously reported sequence [GenBank:
DQ910319]. This substitution was interpreted as a
naturally occurring polymorphism, rather than a PCRintroduced error, both for the proofreading activity of
the thermostable DNA polymerase used for PCR
amplification, and because the ESTs database includes
several entries carrying the same non-synonymous
SNP. The fSG6 protein was expressed as N-terminal
His-tagged recombinant protein in Escherichia coli and
purified from inclusion bodies by affinity and ionexchange chromatography (Figure 1) according to the
procedure previously optimized for the A. gambiae
homologous protein [20].

Study area and entomological data

Seasonal and age-dependent pattern of the IgG response
to gSG6 and fSG6

To evaluate if human IgG directed against the A. gambiae gSG6 cross-reacted to the fSG6 protein and viceversa, the IgG response to both recombinant proteins
was compared in 335 sera from individuals of the
Mossi ethnic group collected in the village of Barkoumbilen (Burkina Faso) during three different surveys: at the beginning and the end of the high
transmission/rainy season (Aug’94 and Oct’94) and in
the following low transmission/dry season (Mar’95). In
the study area the main malaria vectors were A. gambiae, A. arabiensis and A. funestus, with the members
of the A. gambiae species complex (i.e. A. gambiae and
A. arabiensis) being largely prevalent and representing,
on average, approximately 90% of the indoor-resting
Anopheles mosquitoes. Anopheles funestus reached a
maximum toward the end of the high transmission
season in Oct’94 (23.1%), which was also the period
with the highest Anopheles density (12.6 Anopheles/
person/night) as measured through the indoor pyrethrum spray catch method (Figure 2). The IgG
response against recombinant gSG6 and fSG6 was
compared by ELISA using sera from exposed individuals and European non-exposed controls. Considering
the higher prevalence of A. gambiae in the study area,
one would expect to find a differential response to the
two antigens in case of low or moderate cross-reactivity; on the contrary, a similar pattern and a comparable intensity of the IgG response would be indicative
of extensive cross-reactivity. Moreover, analysis of the
response to a mixture of both gSG6 and fSG6 may
provide indications concerning potential additive
effects of their combined use.

As previously shown in the same epidemiological setting
analysed here, the IgG response to the gSG6 antigen
exhibits seasonal variations [20]. More specifically, both
anti-gSG6 IgG levels and seroprevalence increased, or
remained high, during the progression of the transmission/rainy season (Aug’94 to Oct’94) and dropped significantly during the following low transmission/dry season
(Mar’95). The sub-sample analysed here showed, as
expected, the same seasonal variation of the anti-gSG6
IgG response, and a very similar pattern was observed
with the fSG6 protein or when a combination of the
two antigens was used (Figure 3). More specifically, an
increase of the OD levels among the responders was
found for all antigens when comparing the start
(Aug’94) to the end (Oct’94) of the high transmission
season (Mann-Withney, gSG6: P = 0.006; fSG6: P =
0.0008; gSG6 + fSG6: P = 0.033). A significant decrease
was observed during the following low transmission/dry
period for gSG6 and fSG6 (Mann-Withney, Oct’94 vs.
Mar’95, gSG6: P = 0.008; fSG6: P = 0.017), whereas the
decrease was not significant with a mixture of the two
antigens (Figure 3, upper panel). When seroprevalence
was analysed, no significant changes were found during
the high transmission/rainy season (Aug ‘94 to Oct ‘94),
with values ranging from 49% to 59% depending on the
antigen and the survey. On the contrary, a significant
decrease to 32%-39% was observed during the following
low transmission/dry period (chi-square, Aug’94 vs.
Mar’95, gSG6: P = 0.042; fSG6: P = 0.010; gSG6 + fSG6:
P = 0.0005. Oct’94 vs. Mar’95, gSG6: P = 0.026; fSG6: P
= 0.004; gSG6 + fSG6: P = 0.002. Figure 3, lower panel).
Therefore, overall, the analysis of the anti-SG6 IgG

response, independently from the antigen used (gSG6,
fSG6 or both), showed an overlapping pattern of seasonal variation in the exposed individuals.
Previous analysis also showed a peculiar age-dependent pattern of the anti-gSG6 IgG response in mosquito/malaria-exposed individuals from the two villages
of Barkoundouba and Barkoumbilen, Burkina Faso [20].
Individuals from this area, as well as from all malaria
endemic regions, show an age-related profile of
increased seroprevalence and antibody levels against different P. falciparum antigens [22,23]; the humoral
response appears low in children under five years of age
and progressively increases to reach the highest level in
adults. On the contrary, both the anti-gSG6 IgG levels
and prevalence showed an age-dependent decrease,
being higher in children up to ~10 years of age and progressively decreasing in adults [20]. A similar pattern of
decrease with age was found here. In particular, independently from the antigen and the survey, the median

Page 6 of 10

OD value, 75% percentile, maximum OD value and prevalence were higher in 1-10 years old children as compared to >25 years-old individuals, although this
difference reached statistical significance only in about
half the cases (Additional file 1). The lack of statistical
support, at least during the Mar ‘95 survey, is most
likely the result of the seasonal decrease reported above
and of the lower number of responders, which reduce
sample size and tend to flatten age-related differences in
the response during the dry season. A simplified overview of the anti-SG6 IgG response in the different age
classes can be obtained if the three surveys are pooled
together; this does not introduce a bias because individuals belonging to the different age classes are well partitioned in the three surveys (see Additional file 1). As
shown in Figure 4 (upper panel) the anti-SG6 IgG levels
were significantly lower in the sera of individuals older
than 25 years when the gSG6 or both recombinant proteins were used as antigens, whereas the difference was
not significant for the fSG6 protein. As far as the seroprevalence pattern is concerned, the frequency of
responders was higher in children (1-10 years) and
young/adults (10-25 years) than in older individuals
(>25 years) although only in about half the cases this

difference gets statistical support (Additional file 2).
When data on the three surveys are pooled together,
seroprevalence showed a very similar pattern for all the
antigens tested and a significant decrease was observed
in older individuals in comparison to the other two age
classes, i.e 1-10 and 10-25 years-old (Figure 4, lower
panel).
In summary, both the seasonal and the age-related pattern of the anti-SG6 humoral response were very similar
with the gSG6 and the fSG6 recombinant proteins, or
with their combination, and recapitulated what previously observed in the same epidemiological setting
with the A. gambiae gSG6 antigen alone [20].
Comparison of the IgG response to gSG6 and fSG6

Comparison of IgG levels and seroprevalence to gSG6,
fSG6 or their combination in each of the three surveys
did not show any significant difference (Kruskal-Wallis,
Mann Whitney or chi-square tests) as also visible comparing the responses to the different antigens in Figure
3. When only responders to the three antigens in each
survey were considered (Wilcoxon matched-pairs test),
again no difference was found comparing the response
to gSG6 and fSG6, however, a significant increase of
IgG level was found during the high transmission/rainy
season (Aug ‘94 and Oct ‘94) with a combination of
both antigens (Figure 5). The absence of any difference
during the dry season (Mar ‘95) may be ascribed, as
mentioned earlier, to the lower IgG levels and the lower
number of responders. These observations strongly support a wide cross-reactivity to the gSG6 and fSG6 salivary antigens and, in addition, suggest that the two
proteins are most likely carrying species-specific

(14.6 ± 6.3).

epitopes, which would account for the increased antiSG6 IgG level to their combination. According to this
hypothesis, when the response to gSG6 and fSG6 was
directly compared by scatter plot (Figure 6) some individuals showed higher response to the A. funestus protein
(dots above diagonal) and others to the A. gambiae protein (dots below diagonal). Considering the higher prevalence of A. gambiae s.l. mosquitoes (always higher
than 77%) it is not surprising that the best-fit line runs
mostly below the diagonal. The simplest interpretation
is that the higher response to fSG6 in some individuals
is balanced by the higher response to gSG6 in others;
this would give, as final result, the absence of any statistically significant difference between the responses to
the two antigens. On the other hand, the simultaneous
use of both recombinant proteins would imply an additive effect of the species-specific epitopes, which significantly increase the IgG levels in comparison to the
individual antigens (Figure 5).
Overall, the analysis of the humoral response of
exposed individuals from a malaria hyperendemic area
from Burkina Faso to the recombinant SG6 protein
from A. gambiae and A. funestus indicates that there is
wide cross-reactivity to these two antigens. Both IgG
level and seroprevalence obtained with either the gSG6
or the fSG6 antigens were very similar, even in an epidemiological setting where A. gambiae and A. arabiensis, both members of the A. gambiae complex, are
largely prevalent (>77%). Since the SG6 proteins from
these two last species are 99% identical, these observations support the use of the A. gambiae gSG6 as a reliable marker to evaluate human exposure to the three
main Afrotropical malaria vectors: A. gambiae, A. arabiensis and A. funestus. In addition, this study provides

fSG6. OD values among the 122 responders to both gSG6 and fSG6
in the three different surveys are reported. The best-fit is shown as a
black line (slope 0.6301 ± 0.06137) and the diagonal as a red dotted
line. Spearman correlation coefficient r = 0.6612, p < 0.0001.

evidence that gSG6 and fSG6 proteins also carry species-specific epitopes, suggesting that their combined
use may allow for an increase in sensitivity, which may
be especially relevant in conditions of low malaria transmission and/or low density of Anopheles vectors (dry
season, post anti-vector control interventions).
The gSG6 salivary protein: a marker of exposure to both
Afrotropical and Asian malaria vectors?

Genus Anopheles includes ~500 species of which less
than 40 play a dominant role in malaria transmission
and are classified into one of three subgenera [26-28].
The subgenus Cellia includes all main African and Australian, as well as most of the Asian malaria vectors and
can be further divided in six Series; the four ones which
are relevant for malariology and include most of the
species are schematically diagrammed in the cladogram
in Figure 7. Most of the major Central and South American vectors belong to the subgenus Nyssorhynchus
whereas the subgenus Anopheles includes mostly European, North American and a few additional Asian
vectors.
SG6 family members are most likely absent in the
subgenus Nyssorhynchus [18], whereas they have been
found in the saliva of A. freeborni (Anopheles subgenus)
and of important Cellia malaria vectors, namely A. gambiae and A. arabiensis (Pyretophorus), A. funestus

61-62% identical amino acid residues with homologues
from the Cellia subgenus which, in turn, are 80 to 84%
identical among themselves (Table 1). The incomplete
sequence of other members of the SG6 family from a
few additional anopheline species can also be retrieved
by searching ESTs (Expressed Sequence Tag) or SRA
(Sequence Read Archive) databases: Anopheles quadrimaculatus (SRS008483, 65% identity to gSG6, 54/83 aa),
Anopheles anthropophagus (FE969059, 64% identity to
gSG6, 32/50 aa), Anopheles dirus (SRS008433, 68% identity to gSG6, 22/32 aa) and Anopheles farauti
(SRS008445, 59% identity to gSG6, 13/22 aa). Therefore
the SG6 protein is also present in the Neomyzomyia

Series. It is noteworthy that the alignment of all the SG6
proteins identified so far shows a complete conservation
of the 10 cystein residues, which indicates a very conserved folding, a feature certainly relevant for their
recognition from the immune system.
The wide cross-reactivity between the A. gambiae and
A. funestus SG6 proteins, along with the observations
reported above, supports the idea that the anti-gSG6
IgG response may represent a reliable indicator of exposure to malaria vectors of the subgenus Cellia, at least
to members of the Pyretophorus, Myzomyia and Neocellia Series, which share 80% to 84% identity. Therefore, it is likely that the gSG6 protein will also work as
marker of exposure to A. stephensi and other Asian
malaria vectors. Furthermore, the highly conserved folding and the relatively high identity (61-65%) indicates
that anti-gSG6 antibodies are also expected to crossreact with SG6 family members from species of the
Anopheles subgenus, although extension of cross-reaction and its potential usefulness would need proper
validation.

Conclusions
This study provided solid experimental evidence that the
human antibody response to the A. gambiae salivary
protein gSG6 represents a reliable indicator of human
exposure to the three main malaria vectors in tropical
Africa: A. gambiae, A. arabiensis and A. funestus. Such a
tool may be very useful for malaria epidemiological studies and for monitoring vector control interventions.
The additive effect obtained when the two recombinant
proteins are combined also allows for an increase in
sensitivity of the assay. Moreover, data reported here
also suggest that most likely the gSG6 protein may work
as a marker of exposure to A. stephensi and other Asian
malaria vectors or, as alternative, that inclusion of SG6
protein from a third species may provide a sensitive
marker of human exposure to bites of both African and
Asian malaria vectors.
