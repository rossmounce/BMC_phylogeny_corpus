Abstract
Background: CRF02_AG is the predominant HIV strain circulating in West and West Central
Africa. The aim of this study was to test whether this predominance is associated with a higher in
vitro replicative fitness relative to parental subtype A and G viruses. Primary HIV-1 isolates (10
CRF02_AG, 5 subtype A and 5 subtype G) were obtained from a well-described Cameroonian
cohort. Growth competition experiments were carried out at equal multiplicity of infection in
activated T cells and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MO-DC) in parallel.
Results: Dual infection/competition experiments in activated T cells clearly indicated that
CRF02_AG isolates had a significant replication advantage over the subtype A and subtype G
viruses. The higher fitness of CRF02_AG was evident for isolates from patients with CD4+ T cell
counts >200 cells/μL (non-AIDS) or CD4+ T cell counts <200 cells/μL (AIDS), and was
independent of the co-receptor tropism. In MO-DC cultures, CRF02_AG isolates showed a slightly
but not significantly higher replication advantage compared to subtype A or G isolates.
Conclusion: We observed a higher ex vivo replicative fitness of CRF02_AG isolates compared to
subtype A and G viruses from the same geographic region and showed that this was independent
of the co-receptor tropism and irrespective of high or low CD4+ T cell count. This advantage in
replicative fitness may contribute to the dominant spread of CRF02_AG over A and G subtypes in
West and West Central Africa.

Background
Mutation and recombination are important mechanisms
by which HIV evades host immune responses and antiretroviral drug pressure [1]. Recombinant strains of HIV-1
have been found worldwide [2-8]. To date, sixteen Circulating Recombinant Forms (CRFs) have been characterized according to the Los Alamos HIV sequence database
and at least two are of major epidemiological importance.
CRF01_AE [2,3,5] and CRF02_AG [6,7] are causing heterosexual epidemics in Asia and West and West Central
Africa, respectively. CRF02_AG caused approximately
5.3% of all new HIV-infections globally between 1998
and 2000, but is responsible for nearly 31% of new infections in West Africa and about 6.7% in Central Africa [8–
10, UNAIDS]. Earlier studies with smaller numbers of
samples and originating from various African countries
consistently showed that CRF02_AG is more prevalent
than HIV-1 subtypes A and G in West and Central Africa
[10-15]. In the mean time, CRF02_AG viruses have been
introduced in Europe and, to a minor extent, in the US
and Puerto Rico [16,17].
In West and West Central Africa HIV types (1 and 2), HIV1 groups (M, O, N) and many subtypes co-circulate
[18,19]. Cameroon, a country in West Central Africa, has
the genetically most diverse HIV epidemic in the world
and the wide variety of co-circulating HIV groups and subtypes are a major source for intersubtype recombinants
(ISRs) and CRFs [20]. Interestingly, prevalence rates for
CRF02_AG seem to increase more rapidly than prevalence
rates of other subtypes in West Africa and suggest that,
particularly in Cameroon, CRF02_AG may spread more
rapidly than other clades [21-23]. The emergence of
CRF02_AG as the predominant strain causing HIV infections in West Africa may simply be the result of a founder
effect. However, theoretically genetic recombination and
selection may combine the best characteristics of two (or
more) viruses and as such provide an advantage to the
recombinant over other strains. This raises concern that
CRF02_AG may be favored, in terms of a superior replicative fitness and/or transmission efficiency, over other cocirculating strains.
Several studies relate the differential spread of HIV-1
group M, group O and HIV-2 in the human population
(i.e. in vivo fitness) to differences in transmission [24,25]
and pathogenesis [26]. Recent findings on the in vitro replicative fitness of diverse human immunodeficiency
viruses support the hypothesis that the relative replicative
fitness and the prevalence of viral types and subtypes are
related. It was shown that HIV-1 group O and HIV-2 primary isolates had a reduced fitness in activated T cells and
in dendritic cells as compared to HIV-1 group M primary
isolates of subtypes A, B, C, D and CRF01_AE, corroborating with the much higher prevalence of group M, as com-

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/3/1/40

pared to group O and HIV-2 in the pandemic [27].
Furthermore, lower replicative fitness of HIV-2 isolates
compared to HIV-1 group M viruses could be related to
the delayed disease progression observed with HIV-2
infections [27].
In the present study, we tested whether the ex vivo replicative fitness of CRF02_AG may be related to its predominance in West Central Africa. Therefore, we performed
pair-wise competitions using a number of primary
CRF02_AG strains and primary subtype A and G viruses,
all sampled in Cameroon. In order to mimic two relevant
micro-environments, we performed viral competitions in
activated T cells and in dendritic cells (DC). Activated T
cells are the major source of circulating HIV in vivo. For in
vitro testing, activated T cells can easily be generated by
mitogen stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMC). Although primary DC are more difficult to
obtain, monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MO-DC) can be
generated abundantly and have an interstitial-like phenotype (i.e. DC-SIGN+, CCR5+, high T cell stimulatory
capacity) which makes them a representative model for
DC in the genital mucosae. These cells are thought to have
a crucial role in the early events of heterosexual HIV transmission [28,29].

Results
Characterization of primary HIV-1 isolates
Twenty HIV-1 isolates were obtained from a patient
cohort in Cameroon, previously described by Laurent et
al. [14]. Fifteen isolates were found to use only CCR5,
while three viruses could use only CXCR4 and two others
were able to use both CCR5 and CXCR4 as entry co-receptor (Table 1). Sequencing and subsequent phylogenetic
analysis of the complete env and pol regions, gag p24 and
p17 regions, and accessory genes (tat, rev, nef, vpu)
revealed that ten isolates were CRF02_AG, five were subtype A and five were subtype G (Table 1, Figure 1). CD4+
T cell counts in this patient cohort showed a wide variation (from 0 to >1000 cells/μl blood). We subdivided the
patients according to their CD4+ T cell count, i.e. twelve
samples with >200 cells/μl and eight samples with <200
cells/μL (AIDS) (Table 1). Plasma viral load was measured
for each patient at the time of virus isolation. In concordance with recent observations by Fischetti et al. [21] and
Sarr et al. [23], we observed an overall trend to slightly
higher viral load in a random sample of individuals
infected with CRF02_AG (average VL(CRF02_AG)} = 5.13
Log10 RNA copies/mL), compared to those infected with
a subtype A or G isolate (average VL(subtype A and G) = 4.58
Log10 RNA copies/mL) (Table 1), although this difference
was not statistically significant (P = 0.213, t-test). Furthermore, individuals infected with CRF02_AG appeared to
have reduced peripheral CD4+ T cell counts compared to
subjects infected with a subtype A or G virus (average

fore, we have analyzed the relative viral fitness of samples
from infected subjects with CD4+ T cell counts above and
below 200 cells per microliter, separately.
Replicative fitness of CRF02_AG in activated human Tcells
Ten CRF02_AG were competed in duplicate against five
subtype A and five subtype G isolates. CRF02_AG isolates
won 68 out of 100 competitions (68%), resulting in a
median relative fitness (W) of 1.50 (p25 = 0.96, p75 =
1.82). Subtype A isolates and subtype G viruses had a
median relative fitness of 0.50 (p25 = 0.18, p75 = 1.03)
and 0.66 (p25 = 0.22, p75 = 1.13), respectively. The

median relative fitness values for CRF02_AG viruses were
significantly higher than 1.0 (P < 0.001, t-test), and the
relative fitness of both subtype A and G isolates were significantly lower than 1.0 (P < 0.001, t-test) (Figure 2)
(with W = 1.0 being equal replicative fitness).
Earlier experiments showed that HIV-1 replicative fitness
correlates directly with viral load and inversely with CD4+
T cell count [30,31]. Since, the CD4+ T cell counts and
viral loads tended to differ between CRF02_AG and nonCRF02_AG infected subjects in our study population, we
re-analyzed competitions of viral isolates obtained from
CRF02_AG patients with CD4+ T cell counts <200 cells/μl

tropic, three viruses used CXCR4 (X4), and two others
were found to be dual-tropic (R5X4). The X4 CRF02_AG
isolates won 6 out of 6 (100%) competitions against X4
subtype A and G viruses. Similarly, X4 CRF02_AG strains
won 17 out of 24 (70.8%) competitions against R5 subtype A and G viruses. Interestingly, R5 CRF02_AG viruses
also out competed most of the X4 subtype A and G strains
(11 out of 14 competitions or 78.6%). Finally, R5
CRF02_AG won 62.5% (35 out of 56) competitions
against the R5 subtype A and R5 subtype G.
These results suggest that the increased fitness of
CRF02_AG in competitions with subtype A and G viruses
is not caused by differential co-receptor tropism.

and CD4+T cell counts >200 cells/μl against the entire set
of subtype A and G viruses, irrespective of the CD4+ T cell
counts in the patients from whom these viruses were isolated. In the group with CD4+ T cells <200 cells/μl, the
CRF02_AG isolates won 35 out of 50 competitions
(70%), with a median relative fitness of 1.52 (p25 = 1.07,
p75 = 1.83). In the group with CD4+ T cells >200 cells/μl,
the CRF02_AG isolates won 34 out of 50 (68.0%) of the
competitions with a median relative fitness of 1.40 (p25 =
0.84, p75 = 1.79) (Figure 2). These observations suggest
that the difference in replicative fitness between these
viruses is not merely associated with the differences in
CD4+ T cell counts and VL.
There is evidence that the co-receptor tropism may influence HIV-1 replication in T cells [30,32] and that syncytium-inducing (SI)/X4 viruses tend to be more virulent
than NSI/R5 strains. Since our cohort consisted of both X4
and R5 tropic isolates, we analyzed the data correcting for
viral co-receptor tropism. The majority of viruses were R5-

Replicative fitness of CRF02_AG in dendritic cells
Since mucosal dendritic cells are thought to play an
important role in the early phase of sexual transmission
[28,29], assessing the replicative capacity of CRF02_AG
and subtype A and G viruses in a suitable model of
mucosa-like DC, such as the monocyte-derived DC,
would allow us to study the replication efficiency of primary HIV isolates in the context of virus transmission.
Because R5 viruses are consistently found early after transmission, we restricted our analysis to isolates of this phenotype (i.e. four CRF02_AG, one subtype A and three
subtype G isolates).

In MO-DC, CRF02_AG isolates won 62.5% (10 out of 16)
of the competions and showed a median relative fitness of
1.48 (p25 = 0.68, p75 = 1.55, Figure 3). When comparing
fitness data obtained in T-cells and DC, it was obvious
that most of the CRF02_AG isolates that were able to out
compete subtype A and G viruses in DC also out competed subtype A and G strains in T cells. In conclusion, we
found that the replicative fitness of CRF02_AG and subtype A and G viruses is significantly different when measured in activated T cells (P = 0.024, t-test) and also tends
to be different in DC, without reaching statistical significance (P = 0.229, t-test) (Figure 3).

Discussion
The fact that CRF02_AG seems largely predominant over
other circulating HIV strains in an African area with
extremely high HIV genetic diversity may have several
explanations. First, the recombinant form may have some
biological advantage over the parental strains, including a
possibly higher replicative fitness and/or transmission
capacity. Second, the recombinant strain could have been
introduced first in that particular area and consequently
get established in a population before other subtypes
entered the scene (founder-effect) [31]. In the case of the
epidemiological spread of CRF02_AG in West Central
Africa, the founder hypothesis is probably a less likely
explanation. Several studies on the prevalence of HIV-1

our study, Konings et al. [38] studied only thirteen HIV-1
isolates and presented limited data on viral load and
CD4+ T cell counts. Furthermore, the growth competition
assays used in our study are able to discriminate minor
differences in replication capacity and also provide the
internal control lacking in monoinfection kinetic assays,
as used by Konings et al. [38-40].

subtypes in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
have shown that subtypes A and G are relatively prevalent
in this area [34-37]. Moreover, it is likely that at least a
limited spread of subtype A and G viruses must have preceded the creation and spread of CRF02_AG in West Central Africa [35].
In the present study, we explored whether the replicative
fitness of CRF02_AG was related to the epidemiological
spread of this virus in extended areas of West and Central
Africa. We showed that CRF02_AG primary isolates had a
higher replicative fitness compared to subtype A and G
isolates, in a cellular model for HIV pathogenesis (i.e. activated T-cells) and HIV transmission (i.e. MO-DC). The
higher relative replicative fitness of CRF02_AG viruses was
evident for isolates from patients with low (<200 cells/μL)
and with higher (>200 cells/μL) CD4+ T cell counts, and
it was found to be independent of the viral co-receptor
use. An independent study investigating the same hypothesis was published recently and also showed an increased
replicative capacity of CRF02_AG viruses compared to
subtype A and G isolates, using basic virus growth kinetics
as a measure of replication capacity [38]. In contrast to

The viral load in the donor and the integrity of mucosal
tissues in the acceptor are amongst the most important
determinants upon HIV transmission [41,42]. Previous
observations by Fischetti et al. [21], showed significantly
higher viral loads in asymptomatic CRF02_AG infected
individuals compared to patients infected with nonCRF02_AG strains. A direct correlation between viral load
and replicative capacity in activated T cells was repeatedly
shown [30,31]. Taken together with our observations,
these data suggest that patients infected with CRF02_AG
strains may more easily transmit virus, because of a higher
viraemia, which could be a consequence of the higher replicative fitness in activated T cells. This interpretation is
consistent with the observation by Ariën et al. [27], who
previously showed that group M viruses in general have a
much higher in vitro replicative fitness than group O or
HIV-2 viruses, corresponding to the relative spread of
these viruses in the pandemic as a whole and in West
Africa (where they all co-circulate) in particular.
One could argue that the observed higher relative fitness
of CRF02_AG strains versus subtype A and G isolates in
the present study simply reflects a more advanced disease
stage of patients infected with CRF02_AG or a differential
viral co-receptor tropism. However, we have shown that
CRF02_AG with either X4 or R5 co-receptor tropism and
derived from patients with more or less advanced disease
(based on CD4+ T cell count) are on average more fit than
subtype A or G viruses (Figure 2). In addition, our data
suggests that the replicative fitness of CRF02_AG in MODC was slightly, but not significantly higher than the
parental subtypes (A and G) (Figure 3). There is substantial evidence that DC play an important role during HIV
transmission and it could be speculated that a slight
advantage in replicative fitness in dendritic cells may have
an important impact on transmission at the population
level. On the other hand, the number of competitions performed in DC may just have been too low to result in a
significant difference.
Studies by Ball et al. [43] and Ariën et al. [27] showed that
viruses of subtypes B and C were equally fit in Langerhans'
dendritic cells, while subtype C isolates were out competed by any other group M virus in activated PBMC. It is
not completely clear yet how HIV replicative fitness in T
cells and dendritic cells relate to transmission and epidemiological spreading. It is also possible that the focus on

Retrovirology 2006, 3:40

replicative capacity in DC as a measure of transmission
efficiency may be too limited, since other cell types at the
mucosal interface are likely involved in transmitting HIV.
Hence a better model to study HIV transmission is desirable and should include Female Genital Tract (FGT) epithelia and other important target cells, such as T cells and
macrophages, in addition to DC [41,42]. We are currently
elaborating on such models in order to study early events
during HIV transmission and replicative fitness.
The CRF02_AG genome is a mosaic of subtype A (gag, vpr
and parts of pol, env and nef) and subtype G (LTR, rev, tat
and parts of pol, env, and nef). An important question that
needs to be answered is which part of the viral genome
may be responsible for the increased replicative fitness of
CRF02_AG. Unfortunately, our experimental set up did
not allow us to study the contribution of individual genes
to the overall replicative fitness of a virus isolate. Therefore, future studies should try to elucidate the role of those
genes that have a mosaic appearance for their impact on
the fitness of the recombinant virus. It is clear that recombination occurs often in dual- or super infected individuals, generating ISR. It could be speculated that those ISR
that generate viable progeny subsequently undergo severe
selection pressure by the innate and adaptive host
immune responses and that only the most successful/fit
ISR may eventually be able to spread epidemically and
become a CRF.
More detailed analyses of HIV samples from West Africa
have shown that CRF02_AG has already undergone further recombination [34,44]. Clearly, viral recombination
is inevitable with the continuous intermixing of HIV subtypes and will have its impact on the evolution of the HIV
epidemic. It is important to envisage that a CRF that we
label as very fit today may be out competed by a new and
even more fit recombinant virus tomorrow.
In conclusion, our data on a small, but carefully selected
sample from a Cameroonian cohort clearly suggests that
the prevailing CRF02_AG recombinant may be favoured
in his spread over "parental" subtype A and G viruses as a
result of a higher replicative fitness in T cells and likely
also in dendritic cells. More extensive and in-depth studies are needed to confirm this preliminary evidence and to
unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying the predominance of CRF02_AG in large parts of West Africa.

Virginia, USA) and 100μg/ml streptomycin (Cellgro, Virginia, USA). They were first stimulated with 2μg/ml of
phytohemagglutinin (PHA) (Gibco BRL, Maryland USA)
for 3 days and further maintained in 1 ng/ml interleukin
(IL-2) (Gibco BRL, Maryland USA).
Monocytes were obtained from PBMC by counter-flow
elutriation and sheep erythrocyte rosetting, yielding >95%
CD3-/CD4+ MO and <0.5% T cells, as previously
described in [28] and [45]. To obtain MO-DC, monocytes
were cultured for 7 days in RPMI 1640 supplemented with
10% FBS, IL4 (Gibco BRL, Maryland USA) (20 ng/ml),
GM-CSF (Gibco BRL, Maryland USA) (20 ng/ml), 100 U/
ml penicillin and 100μg streptomycin [28,45]. Half of the
culture medium (with cytokines) was replaced every third
day. The MO-DC were immuno phenotyped as CD13+/
CD14 low, CD3-/CD4+, CD1a+ and DC-SIGN high before
use.
Viruses
Twenty viruses were obtained from HIV seropositive
patients attending the military hospital in Yaounde and
Douala in Cameroon [14]. Viruses were isolated between
1996 and 1999 and none of the patients was receiving
antiretroviral treatment (ART) at that time. All patients
signed an individual informed consent. We selected these
twenty strains from a much larger cohort [14], based on
the availability of PBMC and plasma, simultaneously
obtained from these particular patients and permanently
frozen in liquid nitrogen and at -80°C, respectively. CD4+
T cell counts were determined on fresh blood, while viral
load was measured on the stored plasma samples for the
purpose of this study, using an in-house real time PCR
assay (Table 1). The original selection encompassed
twenty-seven isolates (eleven CRF02_AG, ten subtype A
and six subtype G), but six samples were dropped for further analyses because they showed unique recombination
events to have occurred in env and pol, i.e. they were not
pure A, nor G, nor CRF02_AG. For the twenty primary isolates used in this study, subtyping was based on complete
env, complete pol, gag p24, gag p17, tat, rev, nef and vpu
nucleotide sequencing.

Frozen virus stocks were propagated and expanded in
short-term cultures of PHA/IL-2 treated PBMC obtained
from a HIV seronegative blood donor. The 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) was determined by serial
dilution of the virus stock to infect PHA/IL-2 PBMC and
U87.CD4 cells expressing either CCR5 or CXCR4 (Table
1) [46]. Infections with U87.CD4.CCR5 and
U87.CD4.CXCR4 cells were used to determine co-receptor
tropism and to calculate the infectious dose required to
infect MO-DC.

Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis
The HIV-1 strains characterized in this study were cultured
in patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells. DNA was
then extracted from the infected cells using the Qiagen
DNA isolation kit (Qiagen S.A., Courtabeauf, France).
Complete sequences for the pol and the env genes were
generated. The first fragment, spanning the gag-pol region,
was amplified with G00 (5'-GACTAGCGGAGGCTAGAAG-3', position 761–780 on HxB2) and HPOL4538
(5'-TACTGCCCCTTCACCTTTCCA-3', position 4994–
4973 on HxB2) as outer primers. A second round fragment was obtained from a hemi-nested PCR reaction with
G25reverse
(5'-GCAAGTGTTTTGGCTGAAGCAAT-3',
position 1872–1895 on HxB2) and HPOL4538. The second fragment, covering the accessory genes tat, rev and nef,
was amplified using HPOL4235 (5'-CCCTACAATCCCCAAAGTCAAGG-3', position 4668–4691 on HxB2)
and LSIGI (5'-TCAAGGCAAGCTTTATTGAGGCTTAAGCAG-3', positions 9647-9617/542-512 on HxB2). A second round fragment was then generated with envB (5'AGAAAGAGCAGAAGACAGTGGCAATGA-3',
position
6216–6243 on HxB2) and envM (5'-TAGCCCTTCCAGTCCCCCCTTTTCTTTTA-3', position 9116–9087 on
HxB2). Taq Expand Long Template PCR was used according to manufacturer's instructions (Roche, Indianapolis,
USA). And with the following cycling conditions: 3 minutes denaturation at 92°C, 16 cycles at 92°C for 20 seconds, 50°C for 30 seconds and 68°C for 4 minutes,
followed by 16 cycles with 20 second-increments at the
elongation step and a final extension of 10 minutes. The
amplified fragments were purified using a QiaQuick gel
extraction kit (QIAGEN S.A., France), and then directly
sequenced with primers encompassing the pol and the env
regions by using Big-Dye Chemistry (Applied Biosystems,
France) according to the instructions of the manufacturer.
Electrophoresis and data collection were done on an
Applied Biosystems 3100 Genetic Analyzer. The electropherogram plots were visualized and processed under
DNASTAR to generate consensus from the different overlapping sequences.

The newly determined sequences were aligned with
known representatives of the different subtypes, sub-subtypes and CRFs described in Africa, using Clustal W. Sites
with any gap between the sequences and areas of uncertain alignment were excluded from the analysis. Pair wise
evolutionary distances were estimated with Kimura's two
parameters method. Phylogenetic trees were constructed
by NJ method, and the reliability of the tree topology was
assessed by bootstrap analysis. Simplot 3.2 beta software
(Stuart Ray, http://www.med.jhu.edu/deptmed/sray/),
was used to investigate the recombinant structure of the
newly sequenced genes. Similarity and bootscan plots
were performed as already described. Briefly, similarity
plots determined the percent similarity between a newly

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/3/1/40

determined sequence and selected groups of references, by
moving a window of 400 base pairs with 20 base pairs
increments along the genome alignment. Similarity values were plotted at the midpoint of the 400 base pairs
fragment. For the bootstrap plots, the SimPlot software
performed bootscanning on neighbor joining trees by
using SEQBOOT, DNADIST (with Kimura two parameters
method and F84 model of maximum likelihood method,
transition/transversion ratio = 2.0), NEIGHBOR and
CONSENSE from the PHYLIP package for a 400 base pairs
window moved along the alignment in increments of 20
base pairs. One thousand bootstraps replicates were evaluated for each phylogeny. The bootstrap values for the
studied sequences were plotted at the midpoint of each
window. In these two sets of analyses, the new sequences
were compared with consensus sequences (50% threshold) representing the different HIV-1 clades from the
same alignment used for phylogenetic tree analysis.
Finally, all nucleotide sequences were submitted to the
EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database (accession numbers: env; AM279343–AM279369 and pol; AM279370–
AM279396).
Dual infection/competition assays
Dual infection/competition experiments were performed
as previously described [27,30-32]. In short, all
CRF02_AG were competed against 5 subtype A and 5 subtype G, (Table 1) in PHA/IL-2PBMC from one donor in 24
well culture plates and in duplicate. It is important to
mention that aliquots of PBMC of the same buffy coat
were used to grow the virus stocks, determine infectious
titers and perform the competitions. A second set of competitions was performed using all available NSI/R5 isolates in MO-DC from another donor. In these
competition experiments, cells (2 × 105 PHA/IL-2 PBMC
or 1 × 106 MO-DC) were infected with two isolates at
equal multiplicity of infection (5 × 10-4 MOI for PHA/IL2 PBMC or 1 × 10-3 MOI for MO-DCs) [27,32]. The estimated frequency of in vitro recombination between HIV
isolates in the dual infections was less than 0.1%/1000 bp
or well below the limit of HTA detection [30,40]. Uninfected cells were used as HIV-negative controls and monoinfected cultures of each virus were used as positive controls. Infected cell cultures were incubated at 37°C and 5%
CO2 for 24 hours after which residual virus was washed
away with 1x phosphate-buffered saline pH 7.4 (PBS).
Infected cells were re-suspended in medium containing
IL-2 (in case of PHA/IL-2 PBMC) or medium without IL-2
(for MO-DCs) and kept at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 14 days.
Half the culture medium was replaced twice a week. Cell
free supernatant were collected at day 7, 10 and 14 and
analyzed for gag p24 content using an in-house p24 ELISA
assay [47]. Cells were harvested at peak vireamia and
stored at -80°C for subsequent analysis. A more detailed

description of the dual/infection competition assay can be
found in [39,40].
Heteroduplex tracking assay
Genomic DNA was extracted from lysed PHA/IL-2PBMC
using the QIAamp DNA blood kit (Qiagen). Viral DNA
was PCR amplified using a set of external primers (envB;
5'-AGAAAGAGCAGAAGACAGTGGCAATGA-3'
and
ED14; 5'-TCTTGCCTGGAGCTGTTTGATGCCCCAGAC3') and nested primers E80 (5'-CCAATTCCCATACATTATTGTC-3') and E125 (5'-CAATTTCTGGGTCCCCTCCTGAGG-3') to produce a ± 480 bp fragment, encoding the
C2–C4 env region [30]. Both first round and second round
PCR amplifications were carried out in 100μl reaction
mixture under defined cycling conditions [30]. Subsequently, heteroduplex tracking assays (HTA) were preformed to estimate the amount of virus produced by each
isolate in the competition, relative to the amount of virus
produced in monoinfections [30]. The same genomic
region of two subtype B HIV-1 strains (i.e. VI969-6 and JRFL) was amplified and used as probes in the HTA. Probes
were generated in amplification reactions using [γ-32P]
ATP labeled E80 primer radiolabelled PCR-amplified
probes were separated on 1% agarose gels and then purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). Reaction mixtures containing DNA annealing buffer (100 mM
NaCl, 10 mm tris-HCl [pH 7.8], 2 mM EDTA, 10 μl of
unlabelled PCR-amplified DNA from the competition
cultures and approximately 0.1 pmol of radioactive probe
DNA. Each dual infection/competition was analyzed in at
least two independent HTA reactions using two radiolabeled probes. PCR amplicon and probe were denatured at
95°C for 3 min, 37°C for 5 min and then rapidly
annealed on wet ice. After 30 minutes, DNA heteroduplexes were resolved on 5% TBE non-denaturing polyacrylamide (PAGE) gels (Bio-Rad) (75 min. at 200 V). Gels
were then dried for 45 minutes at 80°C and exposed on a
phosphor imaging screen overnight. Images were captured with a phosphor imager (Cyclone, PerkinElmer)
and analysed with the OptiQuant software package (PerkinElmer).
Estimation of relative viral fitness
Relative virus production (ws) of each isolate in a dual
infection was calculated by dividing the amount of isolate
DNA in the dual infection and the amount of the same
isolate DNA in a monoinfection (as determined with the
phosphor imager). From these ws values, relative fitness
(W) values for each virus were obtained using the formula
[W = (ws1/(ws1 + ws2)) x 2], where ws1 and ws2 are relative virus production of isolate 1 and 2, respectively
[30,40].

Statistics
Average CD4+ T cell counts and average viral loads were
calculated for each group of viruses (i.e. CRF02_AG and
non-CRF02_AG). One sample t-tests were used to calculate whether differences in CD4+ T cell counts and VL
between virus groups (i.e. CRF02_AG and nonCRF02_AG) were statistically significant.

Average and interquartile relative fitness values (W) were
calculated for competitions involving CRF02_AG, subtype
A and subtype G virus isolates. One sample t-tests was
used to determine whether the relative fitness of a group
of viruses (i.e. CRF02_AG, or subtype A, or subtype G) was
significantly different from W = 1.0 (with W = 1.0 meaning equal relative fitness). For all analyses, the level of significance was set at P = 0.05.
