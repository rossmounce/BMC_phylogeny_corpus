Periostin shows increased evolutionary plasticity
in its alternatively spliced region
Sebastian Hoersch1,2*, Miguel A Andrade-Navarro3

Abstract
Background: Periostin (POSTN) is a secreted extracellular matrix protein of poorly defined function that has been
related to bone and heart development as well as to cancer. In human and mouse, it is known to undergo
alternative splicing in its C-terminal region, which is devoid of known protein domains. Differential expression of
periostin, sometimes of specific splicing isoforms, is observed in a broad range of human cancers, including breast,
pancreatic, and colon cancer. Here, we combine genomic and transcriptomic sequence data from vertebrate
organisms to study the evolution of periostin and particularly of its C-terminal region.
Results: We found that the C-terminal part of periostin is markedly more variable among vertebrates than the rest
of periostin in terms of exon count, length, and splicing pattern, which we interpret as a consequence of
neofunctionalization after the split between periostin and its paralog transforming growth factor, beta-induced
(TGFBI). We also defined periostin’s sequential 13-amino acid repeat units - well conserved in teleost fish, but more
obscure in higher vertebrates - whose secondary structure is predicted to be consecutive beta strands. We suggest
that these beta strands may mediate binding interactions with other proteins through an extended beta-zipper in
a manner similar to the way repeat units in bacterial cell wall proteins have been reported to bind human
fibronectin.
Conclusions: Our results, obtained with the help of the increasingly large collection of complete vertebrate
genomes, document the evolutionary plasticity of periostin’s C-terminal region, and for the first time suggest a
basis for its functional role.

Background
Periostin (POSTN, PN, OSF-2) is a secreted extracellular
matrix (ECM) glycoprotein of up to 93 kDa with a role
in cell adhesion. It was originally identified in cells of
mesenchymal lineage - osteoblasts, osteoblast-derived
cell lines, the periosteum, and the periodontal ligament
[1,2]. Its role in the development of bones, teeth, and
cartilage has been documented subsequently (e.g. [3-7]).
Furthermore, periostin has in recent years prominently
emerged as important on two distinct fronts, both of
them with notable clinical implications: One is its differential expression in a wide array of epithelial tumors
compared to their respective normal tissues (for reviews,
see [8,9]). For the majority of cancers investigated, periostin expression was found to be increased over normal

tissue, but there are distinct exceptions where this pattern is reversed. The other relevant area is its expression
in the developing and the diseased heart (for reviews,
see [10-13]). In the developing heart, periostin has been
found to be expressed in distinct substructures. In
pathological heart conditions, periostin expression has
been described both in the context of acute events
(myocardial infarction) [14,15], as well as chronic pathological conditions (pressure overload) [15,16].
A comprehensive understanding of periostin’s functional spectrum is still actively developing, but certain
core aspects emerging from those three major areas
(skeletal development, heart development and disease,
and cancer) are coming increasingly into focus. Studies
have associated periostin with epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) in cancer [17,18] and with mesenchymal differentiation [19-22] in the developing heart.

fasciclin [23] have subsequently been refined by expanding the collection of known ECM binding partners (see
below), and secondly by illuminating functional aspects
consistent with a role in contact-signaling [12]. Periostin
protein, whose expression has been found to be promoted for example by TGFbeta1, 2, or 3 and BMP-2 in
multiple studies [2,21,24-28], can bind to certain integrin receptors, which subsequently activate the Akt/PKB
pathway via FAK and PI3K, leading to an enhanced
migratory or invasive phenotype [14,29-33].
The periostin gene in human and mouse has 23 exons,
with a genomic footprint covering about 36 (or 30) kilobases in human (or mouse). Both terminal exons in
mouse and human are protein-coding. The periostin
protein (see Figure 1) has an N-terminal signal sequence
in accordance with its status as a secreted protein, an
EMI domain, and four Fasciclin (FAS1) domains. The
EMI domain, encoded by exons 2 and 3, is thought to
be involved in protein-protein interactions or protein
multimerization [34], and may be responsible for periostin dimers observed in some studies (e.g. [31,35]). A
very recent report described EMI domain-mediated
dimers of periostin and its paralog TGFBI (see below)
[36], making it likely that the dimers observed in various
periostin studies are indeed physiologically relevant.
Besides integrins, periostin has been described to bind
a number of other ECM proteins, for example heparin
[37], fibronectin [38], and collagen I [35,39], although
the precise binding mechanisms are not defined in these
cases. The four fasciclin (FAS1) domains, described as a
cell adhesion module [23], are encoded by exons 3 to

Page 2 of 19

14. As recently reported, each of these FAS1 domains
contains an N-terminal recognition site for g-glutamylcarboxylase, which mediates the post-translational modification of glutamate to g-carboxyglutamate [40]. Also,
integrin binding motifs are found in the second and
fourth FAS1 domain, as inferred from findings of the
periostin paralog transforming growth factor, betainduced (TGFBI, also BIG-H3 or betaig-h3) [41].
Finally, exon 15 is followed by exons 16 - 23, making
up 182 amino acids (in human) and thus a rather substantial part of the protein. The function of this stretch,
sometimes referred to descriptively as “hydrophilic
region” or, as from here onwards, “C-terminal region”, is
essentially unknown, although some aspects of its potential role have been investigated [42]. It is devoid of
known domains and contains few known sequence
motifs: (overlapping) regions of low compositional complexity and of intrinsic disorder (obviously interdependent features) and a C-terminal nuclear localization
signal [43], which appears at odds with periostin’s status
as a secreted protein.
Interestingly, alternative splicing was described early
on for human and murine periostin exclusively in this
C-terminal region [1,2]. This is also suggested by EST
sequence data for human or mouse periostin, where
exons 17 to 21 present themselves as cassette exons that
can be excluded from mature RNA message in various
combinations, or individually.
The periostin paralog TGFBI is a protein with a
domain structure identical to periostin (Figure 1) with
the following exception: TGFBI, comprising only 17

Figure 1 Periostin and TGFBI exon and domain structure. Numbered periostin (POSTN) and TGFBI exons (coding sequence only) are
displayed to scale. Amino acid (AA) position scales and hydrophobicity profiles (adapted from the UCSC proteome browser [84]) for either
protein are displayed above and below the exon structures, respectively. Domains and features in common are displayed in-between: a signal
sequence (ss), an EMI domain, and four FAS1 domains. Vertical black bars in FAS1 domains 2 and 4 mark the integrin binding sites with
conserved central DI dimers. The shaded regions in the N-terminal end of the FAS1 domains represent g-glutamylcarboxylase recognition sites.
Additional features specific to either of the two proteins are indicated by markers positioned in the respective exon structure as follows. Pink
diamond: POSTN N-glycosylation site; blue triangle: TGFBI integrin RGD binding site; green oval: POSTN heparin binding motif (suspected); purple
rectangle: POSTN bipartite nuclear localization signal. The two orange V’s mark sites of genomic variation in periostin of other tetrapods:
between exons 19 and 20, a cluster of 8 additional exon 19 copies observed in X. tropicalis, and an additional exon “21V22” between exons 21
and 22, observed for example in chicken. The periostin region between exons 16 and 22 is flagged as subject to widespread alternative splicing
("AS”), and the extent of the “C-terminal region” as referred to in this work is indicated. See the main text for detailed descriptions.

exons, is notably shorter and lacks completely the Cterminal region that is subject to alternative splicing in
periostin. Periostin and TGFBI sequences diverge fundamentally after the fourth fasciclin domain (i.e. starting at
exon 15). An Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) binding motif for a
subgroup of integrin adhesion receptors (reviewed in
[44]) is found in TGFBI exon 15, which is followed by
two short exons 16 and terminal exon 17. Interestingly,
TGFBI a3b1-integrin binding has been shown to be
mediated not via the canonical RGD binding motif, but
via two pentapeptides containing a central Asp-Ile (DI)
dimer found in the second and fourth FAS1 domain
[41], which were subsequently found to be conformationally similar to RGD peptides [45]. While an RGD
motif is not present in periostin, the DI dimers in FAS1
domains 2 and 4 are conserved between the two proteins, strongly suggesting a mechanism for periostin
integrin binding.
Much of the literature on TGFBI is dedicated to certain relatively common mutations causing a variety for
corneal dystrophies (reviewed e.g. in [46]), a functional
aspect for which there is no known counterpart for periostin. Like periostin, TGFBI is a TGFbeta-induced,
secreted, integrin-binding ECM protein expressed during cardiac development and differentially expressed in
certain epithelial cancers (e.g. [47]). But there is also
mounting evidence that periostin and TGFBI can have
complementary or opposite roles in cancer and development. For cancer, reports highlight a tumor-suppressive
role of TGFBI (e.g. [48,49]), and complementary expression patterns of periostin and TGFBI in the developing
heart were explicitly studied [50].
Here we present the results of our computational analysis of periostin’s C-terminal region (exons 16 - 23),
which constitutes the most visible difference between
periostin and its paralog TGFBI and is hence likely to
be a major determinant of the functional differences
between these two genes and of periostin function per
se.
Against the backdrop of unavailable functional or
structural annotation and of indications for greater phylogenetic variability relative to the much better annotated rest of the gene, our interest was increased by the
pervasive alternative splicing specific to this part of periostin. Periostin isoform heterogeneity is a source of significant complexity in the rapidly growing body of
research on this gene, exacerbated by the fact that the
precise nature of the variants observed or used experimentally is not always readily apparent. But cell-specific
periostin isoform profiles have been demonstrated early
on [2], and isoform-specific biological properties have
been documented subsequently (e.g. [14,51,52]). It is
hence not an exaggeration to expect that an improved
understanding of periostin’s C-terminal region in

Page 3 of 19

general and its alternative splicing patterns in particular
may help resolve the sometimes controversial findings
on periostin’s biological effects.

Methods
Profile-based homology search

We compiled an alignment of two consecutive repeats
from fragment 675-700 of periostin isoform 1 [Danio
rerio] (RefSeq:NP_001071254.1) with fragments from
another two sequences from D. rerio and one from
Xenopus tropicalis found via BLAST [53]. The alignment
was done using ClustalW [54] and manual editing. This
alignment was converted into a profile and used for a
search against UniRef100 with the program hmmsearch
[55]. Iterative searches and addition of new positives led
to a progressively refined profile with repeats from Tetraodon nigroviridis, Takifugu rubripes, and chicken,
which matched mammalian periostin sequences (including human) at E-value 1.8 (3rd iteration). No false positive was observed below this E-value.
Periostin locus identification and sequence reconstruction
(assembled genomes)

Periostin loci in genome assemblies of interest (detailed
in Additional file 1, Table S1) were identified in the
UCSC genome browser [56] (accessible at http://genome.ucsc.edu/) via a combination of annotation tracks
[57], where possible. Otherwise, the BLAT [58] search
function within the genome browser was used to search
with known periostin sequences from other organisms.
If available, transcript data (UCSC tracks ‘(species)
mRNAs from GenBank’ and ‘(species) ESTs That Have
Been Spliced’ were used to synthesize full-length periostin sequences with a complete set of exons, commonly
resulting in full-length sequences with a higher exon
count than found in available RefSeq sequences (Mm,
Gg, Xt, Dr).
We identified individual missing exons or refined the
boundaries of individual exons with the help of BLATbased alignments and the ‘Vertebrate Multiz Alignment
& Conservation track’ [59], which provides sequencelevel genomic alignments for many vertebrate genomes.
For teleosts, we used periostin gene predictions from
the Ensembl database [60] (accessible at http://www.
ensembl.org ), if available, in combination with transcript evidence or BLAST-based efforts to expand exon
coverage.
For genome assemblies with insufficient or no transcript coverage of periostin, we performed TBLASTN
[53] searches with a known full-length periostin
sequence (usually human or chicken periostin for tetrapods and zebrafish locus 1 periostin for teleosts) as
query against a genomic sequence fragment comprising
the periostin locus as a subject sequence, changing
default BLAST parameters to not mask repeats and to

Hoersch and Andrade-Navarro BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:30
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/30

report hits with E-values higher than 10.0. TBLASTN
hits were then evaluated in an exon-by-exon fashion:
exact exon boundaries were defined aided by the ‘Vertebrate Multiz Alignment & Conservation track’ and on
the basis of assuming splice site conservation with canonical GT-AG intronic splice sites in all cases as common practice in the comparative genomics field [61],
and the correct sequential order of the exons in the
genomic sequences was ascertained. It is hence important to bear in mind the putative nature of this group of
predicted periostin sequences.
Multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees

All multiple sequence alignments were performed using
the ClustalW algorithm as implemented in the ClustalX
(version 2.0.11) software package [54], using default
parameters, in particular using Neighbor Joining as the
clustering algorithm. Bootstrapping values were obtained
based on 1000 trials. Alignment-based phylogenetic
trees were generated with gapped positions excluded
and visualized with NJplot (described in [62]).
Genomic sequence alignments

In addition to the seven tetrapod and five teleost species
listed in Additional file 1, Table S1, we selected 16 additional species to study periostin exon 21V22 in the context of an alignment of genomic sequences containing
the periostin locus.
Five additional genomic sequences were obtained from
the UCSC genome browser [56] for dog (Canis familiaris, assembly canFam2), cow (Bos taurus, assembly
bosTau4), horse (Equus caballus, assembly equCab2),
zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata, assembly taeGut1),
and tentatively for lamprey (Petromyzon marinus,
assembly petMar1).
Another 11 genomic sequences were obtained with
the help of the Ensembl genome browser (http://www.
ensembl.org) from generally less mature genome assemblies of other organisms, after the periostin locus was
identified using the ‘Projected human gene’ track. These
organisms were: armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), dolphin (Tursiops truncates), European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus), hyrax (Procavia capensis), kangaroo rat
(Dipodomys ordii), lesser hedgehog tenrec (Echinops telfairi), megabat (Pteropus vampyrus), microbat (Myotis
lucifugus), squirrel (Spermophilus tridecemlineatus), tarsier (Tarsius syrichta), and tree shrew (Tupaia
belangeri).
The genome sequence alignments were then performed using the VISTA suite of computational genomics web tools [63] (accessible at http://genome.lbl.gov/
vista/ ), using the mVISTA option as appropriate for
aligning and comparing genomic sequences from multiple species. Within mVISTA, ‘Shuffle-LAGAN’ [64] was
chosen as the alignment program, no repeat masking
was performed, and “translated anchoring” was selected

Page 4 of 19

for its reported potential to improve alignment of distant homologs. VISTA was run twice, with two different
“reference sequences” that the alignment is anchored to:
genomic periostin sequence from chicken was used as
reference sequence to study exon 21V22 (Additional file
2, Figure S1 and Additional file 3, Table S2A), and
genomic periostin sequence from human was used to
study exon 17 (Additional file 3, Table S2B).
Sequence logos

Sequence logos were generated using the internet-based
tool WebLogo (version 2.8.2) [65] (accessible at http://
weblogo.berkeley.edu/), without small sample correction
and with a customized color scheme.
For tetrapod exon sequence logos, exon-specific alignment blocks from seven tetrapod species (Additional file
1, Table S1) were submitted individually for sequence
logo generation. The teleost repeat sequence logo was
obtained by manually aligning the individual 13 amino
acid repeat units within exon 18=19 from D. rerio, locus
1 (6 repeat units) and locus 2 (13 repeat units), G. aculeatus, locus 1 (7 repeat units) and locus 2 (5 repeat
units), T. nigroviridis, locus 2 (8 repeat units), and T.
rubripes, locus 2 (6 repeat units), totaling 45 repeat
units. Alignment involved the occasional introduction of
gaps and, in one case, the deletion of one amino acid
from one repeat sequence to avoid the introduction of a
gap position into the repeat alignment. This repeat
alignment block was then duplicated (side-by-side)
before being submitted for sequence logo generation.
Repeat visualization with dot-matrix plots

To visualize repetitive patterns within sequences with 2dimensional matrix dot plots, the JAVA application
JDotter [66] (accessible at http://athena.bioc.uvic.ca/
tools/JDotter) was used. For genomic DNA sequences,
(Additional file 4, Figure S2) we used a sliding window
of size 50 (default) and a DNA scoring matrix of +5 for
a match and -4 for a mismatch. Dot plots were originally generated at a resolution of 1 nucleotide per pixel
and displayed with the following parameters for the
“GreyMap Tool” to optimize visibility of the repeats in
the display: 0 (top)/35 (bottom).
For protein sequences, we used a sliding window of
size 5 and the amino acid scoring matrix BLOSUM62.
The dot plot was generated at a resolution of 1 residue
per pixel and with default “GreyMap Tool” parameters 0
(top)/245 (bottom) for the matrix display to obtain the
maximum dynamic range of grey-values. The grey value
continuum underlying this matrix display was then converted into a color continuum (white-yellow-orange-redblack) using standard image manipulation software.
Secondary structure predictions

For secondary structure predictions, we used PsiPred
[67] implemented as a web-based tool [68] (accessible at
http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/). PsiPred v2.5 was used

Hoersch and Andrade-Navarro BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:30
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/30

for all predictions. Predictions were performed without
any filtering options selected, in particular without the
option to mask low complexity regions (selected by
default).
Determination of periostin exon 21 and exon 21V22 in
Xenopus laevis

For 21 EST sequences from X. laevis periostin, the
UCSC browser indicated additional sequence without
genomic match at a position coincident with an assembly gap between scaffold_505_18 and scaffold_505_19.
The EST subsequences without genomic coverage were
analyzed and determined to be identical, with a length
of 81 nucleotides. Protein sequence comparisons with
chicken periostin showed that the unmatched subsequence is periostin exon 21 and that the following exon
(seen in 9 out of a total of 33 EST sequences covering
this region) is actually exon 21V22 (data not shown).

Results
Exon naming conventions

Periostin is universally described as a 23-exon gene. Our
findings, going beyond the scope of human and mouse
as the organisms in which periostin has been investigated, expand and modify this notion on multiple
counts. To keep our exon designations consistent with
those in the existing literature while maintaining the
capability to capture the new findings presented here,
we decided on the following rules:
We consider exons 1 - 23 as described for human and
murine periostin “canonical” and leave their numbering
unaltered. We refer to homologous exons in other species by the same numbers, even if variations in exon
count were found to exist.
Additional or modified exons without direct counterparts in human or mouse are referred to by special designations we are introducing here (see also Additional
file 1, Table S1).
The tetrapod periostin C-terminal region is homologous
to a repetitive part of teleost fish periostin

Our early attempts to identify homologs of known function to the C-terminal part of human or murine periostin using sequence similarity searches in protein
databases produced exclusively hits to corresponding
regions in tetrapod periostin sequences. An iterative
search (PSI-BLAST) with this region (exons 16 - 23)
alone produced an alignment (data not shown), with a
sequence fragment of zebrafish (Danio rerio) periostin
marked by a highly conserved 5-fold 13-amino acid
repeat [39], covering exons 16 - 20 of the human periostin query.
In order to ascertain actual homology between the
obviously repetitive part of zebrafish periostin and the
C-terminal part of mammalian periostin, we conducted
a profile-based homology search with repeat units of the

Page 5 of 19

zebrafish periostin (see Methods for details). We found
that a search with only one repeat unit resulted in spurious hits, i.e., protein sequences of generically repetitive
nature, e.g., myosin. However, using as few as two
repeat units together for the search produced as the top
hits specifically periostin C-terminal sequences from
other vertebrate organisms, including human and
mouse.
These results confirmed an evolutionary relationship
between mammalian periostin C-terminal sequence and
a zebrafish periostin repeat region, but since no significant hits to other proteins were found, it also marked
the “end of the road” for attempts to identify similarities
to gene sequences other than periostin for a tentative
functional annotation. We hence decided to systematically compare complete periostin sequences and especially their C-terminal region across a range of
phylogenetically diverse vertebrates in the hope of gaining clues to the functional role of the C-terminal region.
Full length periostin sequence, including the alternatively
spliced part, can be inferred for many vertebrates with
genomic data

Besides human and mouse as representatives of placental (eutherian) mammals, we selected as the basis for
detailed study of periostin the complete genome
sequences of the following tetrapod species: gray shorttailed opossum (Monodelphis domestica), platypus
(Ornithorhynchus anatinus), chicken (Gallus gallus),
green anole lizard (Anolis carolensis), and western
clawed frog (Xenopus tropicalis). Furthermore, teleost
fish genomes were added, namely of zebrafish (Danio
rerio), stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), medaka
(Oryzias latipes), and two pufferfish, Tetraodon nigroviridis and Takifugu rubripes, adding up to 12 vertebrate or, more narrowly, euteleostome - species.
Full-length periostin sequences comprising all exons
are only readily available or annotated in public
sequence databases for a subset of these vertebrate
species. This was the case for human, mouse, chicken,
frog, and a subset of teleost fish, although for some of
these, several mRNA and/or EST sequences had to be
combined to obtain complete sequences, or quality
deficiencies in the genomic assembly required additional efforts (in X. tropicalis). For the remaining species, the periostin coding sequence was inferred using
a combination of approaches (detailed in Methods). A
detailed account of the origin and status of each species’ periostin protein sequence is provided in Additional file 1, Table S1, and the actual sequences are
provided in a comprehensive listing in Additional file
5. In the same table, we summarize existing evidence
for periostin transcript variation and for other unusual
features of periostin gene structure in the 12 species
selected for detailed analysis.

We will return to a detailed analysis of the 13 amino
acid repeat motif later in the manuscript and focus first
on transcriptional and genomic evidence for periostin
isoforms.
Alternative splicing events specific to the periostin Cterminal region are observed in all euteleostome lines
with sufficient transcript evidence, including teleost fish

Alternative splicing affecting the region from exon 17 to
exon 21 has been described for human [1] and murine
periostin [2]. By evaluating available transcript evidence
for the vertebrate species considered in this work, we
universally found evidence for alternative splicing specific to this region for all species with non-trivial amounts
of sequence data (see Additional file 1, Table S1 for
details). This includes three fish species (zebrafish, stickleback, and medaka). Note that Additional file 1, Table
S1 lists also transcript evidence for alternative periostin
5’ and 3’ ends observed in some species, including
human.
Available periostin transcript evidence suggests that
the set of exons subject to alternative splicing is also
species-dependent (Additional file 1, Table S1). This
observation is subject to considerable uncertainty due to
limited transcript coverage, but human and murine periostin are compelling examples, having substantial
amounts of transcript evidence. We found that in
human, exons 17, 18, 19, and 21 - but never 20 - are
alternatively spliced, but in mouse, alternative splicing
does affect exon 20, as well as exons 17 and 21.
In summary, the aggregation of transcript data suggests that the occurrence of alternative splicing is a universal hallmark of this part of the periostin gene. This
transcriptional variability could be important for a complete understanding of periostin function.
A 24th periostin exon is functional, expressed, and
alternatively spliced in some tetrapod lines

Both human and murine periostin have been characterized as having a maximum of 23 exons ("canonical
exons”), according to a substantial amount of periostin
mRNA and EST sequences in these organisms.
Our analysis of the chicken periostin locus revealed
the existence of an additional non-canonical exon situated between canonical exons 21 and 22, which we
termed “21V22” to reflect this property. Exon 21V22 is
present in 8 of the 15 mRNA/EST sequences covering
this region. It is flanked by canonical splice sites and is
87 nucleotides long, allowing for maintenance of the
reading frame without stop codon and thus translation
into protein.
Sequence similarity searches with the protein
sequence of this exon against genomic sequences produced clear matches in zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), lizard, opossum, and platypus, which are devoid of
periostin transcript evidence. In all of these, the most

Page 6 of 19

basic hallmarks of a functional exon (maintenance of
the reading frame without stop codon, canonical flanking splice sites) were also found, suggesting that this
exon may also be functional in these species. However,
equivalent searches failed to produce hits for this exon
in frog (where we identified it separately, see below)
and, interestingly, in placental mammals (human,
mouse, dog, cow). While this echoes EST evidence for
these species, we were surprised by the complete
absence of even low quality hits in the genomic
sequences, and performed a multiple alignment of periostin locus genomic sequence from 33 vertebrate species
to get a clearer understanding of the “fate” of this exon
across vertebrate taxa.
The genomic sequence alignment (Additional file 2,
Figure S1) with chicken periostin as a reference shows a
clear conservation peak for exon 21V22 not only for the
aforementioned species for which this exon is known or
highly likely to be expressed (chicken, finch, lizard,
opossum, platypus; >75% conservation), but also for
most other mammals tested (<75% conservation),
including human.
We then analyzed the nucleotide sequences underlying
the exon 21V22 conservation peaks (Additional file 3,
Table S2A). We noted that for those species where the
conservation peak was below 75%, hallmarks for a functional exon in general (maintenance of reading frame,
no stop codons, flanking intronic GT-AG splice sites)
were missing in many cases. In some others, these hallmarks are preserved, and the exon could be functional.
For example, in human, there could theoretically be
exon 21V22 expression within full-length periostin transcripts and translation into protein product, as underscored by the GENSCAN [69] gene model
NT_024524.504 (UCSC browser, Human Mar. 2006
Assembly), with a terminal exon identical to exon
21V22. The fact that it has never been experimentally
observed leads us to speculate that the encoded protein
sequence may either be expressed in unobserved conditions or be incompatible with human periostin function
and remain unexpressed.
We conclude that exon 21V22 is a periostin exon not
previously described. It is located between exons 21 and
22, and related in sequence to exons 17 - 21. Like these,
it is subject to alternative splicing. Its expression is confined to a subgroup of vertebrates, including birds,
where its expression is de facto observed in chicken,
amphibians (see below), and putatively in lizards and
non-placental mammals.
X. tropicalis expresses periostin exon 21V22 and a cluster
of up to 8 additional genomically encoded exon 19

presents a notable feature: the number of (alternatively
spliced) exons upstream of exons 21 and 21V22 by far
exceeds the number of exons encountered in periostin
from any other tetrapod species. Specifically, compared
to mRNA sequence BC154911.1 as a reference, EST
sequences indicate up to eight additional exons between
exons 19 and 20. Analysis of these eight exon sequences
revealed that they are extremely similar to X. tropicalis
exon 19 (Figure 2), and we refer to these exons as exons
19A to exon19H. We are confident that these exons are
not an artifact due to the preliminary nature of the X.
tropicalis genome assembly, because they are present in
both genomic and transcript sequence. Furthermore, we
found a similar cluster of at least seven exon 19-like
sequences among Xenopus laevis transcript sequences
via similarity searches with X. tropicalis exons 19 and
19A - 19H as a query sequence (e.g. X. laevis mRNA
GenBank:CB200763.2; data not shown).
An overview of all X. tropicalis ESTs covering the
exon 19/20 region is given in Additional file 3, Table S3.
Comparing the library origin between ESTs splicing
directly from exon 19 to exon 20 (5 ESTs) to those that
contain at least a subset of exons 19A - 19H (24 ESTs)
revealed a strong bias for embryonic or metamorphic
origin in the latter set. While far from definitive, this
suggests the possibility of a developmental role of exons
from the 19A - 19H cluster.
We furthermore analyzed the region without genomic
match occurring in a majority of ESTs downstream of
the exon 19 cluster (marked ‘*’ in Figure 2), co-incident
with a gap in the genomic assembly, and concluded that
the unmatched region is periostin exon 21 and that the
following exon (seen in 9 out of 33 transcript sequences
covering this region) is actually exon 21V22 (see
Methods).

to the exon following exon 17 as exon “18=19”, because
for many of the teleost periostin sequences, it allows us
to keep a numbering scheme on the basis of 23 periostin exons intact).
Evaluating the alignment and the secondary structure
predictions in more detail, the following exceptions and
refinements are notable:

The predicted basic secondary structure of the periostin
C-terminus, consecutive beta sheets separated by turns,
is conserved in periostin sequences across vertebrate
species regardless of exon structure

The predicted structure of two beta-strands per exon
is interesting in light of the transcriptional variability
these exons are subject to: Evidence for alternative splicing exists for each of the exons from 17 to 21V22 in at
least one tetrapod species (Additional file 1, Table S1).
The genomic duplications of exon 19 in Xenopus tropicalis are also alternatively spliced (Additional file 3,
Table S3). Alternative in- or exclusion of any of these
exons will then add or remove pairs of beta-strands to
or from the protein.

We subjected periostin protein sequences exons 15 to
23 from 7 tetrapods (human, mouse, opossum, platypus,
chicken, lizard, and frog) and 2 teleost fish species (zebrafish, locus 1 and stickleback, locus 1, see below) to a
secondary structure prediction algorithm (See Methods
for details). Prediction results are shown in Figure 3 in
the context of a multiple sequence alignment of the
nine sequences.
Generally, results show a universal multi-beta strand
structure starting at the end of exon 15 and continuing
into exon 22. Starting in exon 17, beta strands are
usually separated by short coil stretches around proline
residues occurring with a periodicity of 13 (or close to
13) in fish and at often somewhat larger intervals in tetrapods. (Note that for practical reasons, we are referring

-For tetrapod exons 17 to 21 (and 21V22, where
applicable), each exon accommodates two betastrands.
-Starting with exon 20 (middle, Xt: exon 21), the
recurring proline residue is “lost” in tetrapod exons
20 and 21 and “reappears” universally in exon 22. It
is also present in exon 21V22 (middle) found in only
five of the seven species considered here.
-For the most part, the pattern of beta strands separated by coils continues through exons 20 and 21
despite the absence of a proline residue. However,
interestingly, exon 20 (second half), and exon 21
(second half) show a predicted alpha helix instead of
a beta sheet in some of the species.
-Due to the strongly conserved repeat structure in
teleost fish, the beta strands are very regular here.
Remarkably, they are also in phase with the tetrapod
beta strands in the multiple sequence alignment.
-In the multiple sequence alignment, teleost exon 21
is aligned with tetrapod exon 21V22 and teleost
exon 20 is aligned with tetrapod exon 21 (partial).
This reflects both the length of teleost exon 18=19
accommodating, in the alignment, multiple tetrapod
exons, and the uncertainty regarding a direct orthology between the short teleost exons 20 and 21 and
tetrapod exons 20 and 21.

Teleost fish genomes have two copies of periostin

Identifying the genomic periostin locus was straightforward in all tetrapod genomes, even in those lacking
periostin transcript data (lizard, platypus, opossum)
based on relevant multi- or cross-species tracks in the
UCSC Genome Browser.
However, it is believed that the common ancestor of
teleost fish has undergone whole-genome duplication
(WGD) or at least a large-scale gene duplication event

Figure 2 The Xenopus tropicalis periostin C-terminal region in the UCSC genome browser. (A) The ‘Spliced EST’ track shows a cluster of
eight additional genomic copies of exon 19 (referred to here as exons 19A - 19H) immediately downstream of exon 19. These exons, not
represented in the RefSeq record, are subject to alternative splicing in various combinations. The asterisk (*) marks a region where multiple ESTs
have subsequences unaligned to genomic sequence due to a gap in the assembly (not shown), which we resolved to be exon 21 (see main
text). (B) Amino acid sequences of exons 19 and 19A - 19H. The very high degree of similarity among these is evident.

[70], complicating the situation. A systematic genomewide sequence search (BLAT) with human periostin
sequence against the five fish genomes resulted in typically three distinct matches. Analysis of these matches
in terms of length and similarity indicated that the two
stronger matches corresponded to periostin. This was
confirmed by the reciprocal results of a genomic search
with human TGFBI sequence. Here, the best match was
always the third-ranked hit from the previous periostin
genomic search (data not shown).
We conclude that teleost fish retained both copies of
periostin after the duplication event. By contrast, the

second copy of TGFBI was either universally lost (i.e.
presumably before the teleost species radiation), or
TGFBI was not part of the duplicated gene complement.
Our designation of the two periostin loci in the fish species as “locus 1” and “locus 2” (see Additional file 1,
Table S1 for genomic coordinates) was done on the basis
of expression level as judged by the amount of transcript
evidence mapped to either locus in the UCSC genome
browser. Where possible (zebrafish and tentatively stickleback), we assigned the label “locus 1” to the locus
found to be more highly expressed by that measure, coinciding in the case of zebrafish with the version of

strands, across all species considered here, is obvious.

periostin described in the literature [21]. For the other
fish species, we based the assignment on the grouping
resulting from a multiple alignment-based dendrogram
of teleost periostin protein sequences (see below).
We reconstructed as completely as possible periostin
coding sequence from both loci for four of the five teleost fish species, relying mostly on sequence similarity
searches with the known periostin sequence from zebrafish. In several cases, missing exons or other uncertainties remain due to gaps in genomic sequence and/or
complete lack of any guiding transcript coverage. For

one species (medaka), reconstruction from one periostin
locus was not undertaken due to the fragmentary nature
of the genomic sequence data.
A dendrogram based on an alignment of seven tetrapod periostin sequences (see above) together with the
nine teleost periostin sequences shows, among the teleosts, a separation into two major branches by periostin
locus 1 vs. 2 (Figure 4A) preceding the branching into
the multiple teleost lineages, and thus echoing the genome duplication event. Within each branch (i.e., periostin locus), the dendrogram structure recapitulates the

phylogenetic relationship between the five teleost fish
species (minus medaka for one locus), i.e., zebrafish as a
member of the Ostariophysi lineage most distant from
the other four species (Euteleostei), and the two puffers

together.
Periostin sequence conservation is dramatically lower in
its C-terminal region

Up to exon 16, periostin sequences are extremely well
conserved between all euteleostomes, including the two
periostin loci in teleosts. In fact, not counting exons not

reconstructed due to missing genomic sequence and
uncertainties around the boundaries of Ensembl-prediction based exons 15 and 16 for locus 2 in Tetraodon, a
multiple sequence alignment for all seven tetrapod and
nine teleost periostin sequences showed only 5 gapped
positions from exon 2 through 16.
By contrast, for tetrapod periostin sequences alone,
and not counting gaps corresponding to entire exons
(see below), we counted 32 gapped columns in a multiple sequence alignment from exons 16 to 22. This
increased speed at which the C-terminal part of

reconstructed. The dendrogram accurately reproduces established taxonomic lineages (adapted from the NCBI Taxonomy Browser [85]) for the

increased rate of evolution of periostin’s C-terminal region.

periostin evolves compared to the larger N-terminal
portion comprising the EMI and fasciclin domains is
also reflected in alignment-based dendrograms derived
separately for these two sections of periostin sequence
(Figure 4B). The overall tree topology is identical in
both cases (with the exception of the relative positioning
of opossum and platypus), but branch lengths are markedly longer for the C-terminal region-based alignment.
Finally, further elements of genomic and transcriptional
variation, discussed in detail below and exclusively
found in the C-terminal periostin region, are adding to
the picture of a part of the periostin gene that shows
highly divergent and dynamic characteristics.
Starting with exon 17, we found in some cases dramatic variation with respect to exon number, exon
length, and overall sequence conservation, some of
which we described above for tetrapod species. The
divergence for this region is, in some respects, even
higher between teleost species.
In fish, we observed exon 17 to vary in length between
5 and 11 amino acids. Interestingly, short versions of
exon 17 also occur among tetrapod periostin sequences,
where the standard exon 17 length is 26 amino acids:
birds (chicken and zebra finch) as well as frog (but not
reptiles) have an exon 17 that is about 16 amino acids
in length.
Exon 18=19 is especially remarkable in teleost fish: in
periostin sequences from all species except medaka
(Oryzias latipes), we found it to be longer than neighboring exons, sometimes remarkably so - for stickleback
periostin from locus 2, it is 91 amino acids long (with
EST coverage); for zebrafish locus 2, it appears to
encode 187 amino acids (incomplete EST coverage).
This exon is marked by a repeat structure that is
obvious to unaided visual inspection and readily surfaced via high-quality secondary hits in genome-wide
sequence searches with nucleotide or protein sequences
containing the repeat. It was chiefly this exon (in zebrafish) which we had initially observed aligning to the
human periostin query of exons 16 - 23 in a iterative
sequence search, and it is this exon from which the
repeat sequence for the profile-based homology search
was taken.
Characterization of the periostin repeats

The periodicity of this repeat is generally 39 nucleotides/13 amino acids. Slight deviations from this length
are observed in a fashion that keeps the reading frame
intact. We used matrix dot plots to get a more detailed
understanding of the repeat properties (see Methods for
details). Interestingly, the repeat exhibits similarity to its
reverse complement to varying degrees. The most notable example here is in stickleback periostin locus 1,
where exon 18=19 reverse-complement similarity
reaches 25/39 (64%) nucleotide identities with no gaps.

Page 11 of 19

This level of similarity is readily revealed in the matrix
dot plots as lines orthogonal to the main diagonal.
Other repeat instances show weaker levels of reversecomplement similarity that are not readily surfaced in
the dot plots (e.g., 19/42 identities including a gap of 3
positions for zebrafish periostin exon 18=19 at locus 2
(Figure 5)).
Visualizing genomic periostin sequence extending
beyond the boundaries of the repeat exon(s) in dotmatrix plots, we observed that the repeat pattern
appears confined to the exons and does not extend
into adjacent intronic sequence (Additional file 4, Figure S2).
The matrix dot plot in Figure 5 further illustrates our
finding that the number of exons beyond exon “18=19”
in teleosts is variable: Zebrafish locus 1 periostin has 4
more exons, but locus 2 periostin has as many as seven,
the largest number we found. Many of these “extra”
exons also show the repeat structure observed in exon
18=19 (Figure 5). On the other hand, periostin from the
stickleback locus 2 has only 3 more exons after exon
18=19, one less than the canonical number.
On the protein level, the 39-nucleotide repeats encode
a 13-amino acid sequence with the following consensus:
PSITKVTRVIEGE. (Figure 6A; amino acids that in italics were found to be the most frequent at this position
in every locus-specific repeat alignment considered,
which were for both loci from zebrafish and stickleback,
and for one locus from each of the two puffers, T. nigroviridis and T. rubripes). Its key characteristics as given
here are: (i) a Pro at position 1, (ii) a stretch of hydrophobic amino acids (mostly Thr and Val) from positions
3 to 10, interspersed with the positively charged amino
acids Lys and Arg in positions 5 and 8, and (iii) a final
stretch of three amino acids that is dominated by negatively charged Glu and Asp (mostly at positions 11 and
13, with a Gly in between).
Tetrapod periostin sequences do not have a large exon
with obvious repeats like most teleost fish. However, dot
matrix plots readily reveal self similarities within the
transcript region spanned by exons 17 - 22 (Additional
file 4, Figure S3).
Similarities to the teleost repeat are likewise demonstrated: Figure 6B-K gives sequence logo representations
[65] for the teleost repeat described above and for periostin exons 15 - 23 derived from the seven tetrapods
considered here (Hs, Mm, Md, Oa, Gg, Ac, Xt). A
color-coded version of a matrix dot plot is shown, generated by comparing 2 instances of the teleost repeat
consensus (26 aa) against concatenated tetrapod consensus sequences from exons 15 - 23. The highest similarities to the 13 aa repeat are detected in exon 18, exon 19
(X. tropicalis, see below), exon 21, and exon 21V22 (see
below), whereas we see somewhat weaker similarities in

(white-yellow-orange-red-black), with white indicating highest similarity and black indicating no similarity. Both this dot plot and the sequence
logos indicate the strong similarities between the teleost repeats and the tetrapod C-terminal exons found in the alternatively spliced exons 17 21V22 (see main text).

exons 17, 19, and 20. Similarities in exons 15, 16, and 22
are markedly weaker than those found in the exons inbetween.
The concept that tetrapod exons between 16 and 22
are homologous to the long repeat exon 18=19 in teleost fish is powerfully reinforced by the alignment given
in Figure 3. This alignment shows not only the primary
structure (sequence), but also the predicted secondary
structure elements. Here, tetrapod exons 17 to 21V22
align with the teleost repeats such that the sequence
alignment results also in an alignment of the secondary
structure elements, i.e., the beta strands. Critically, tetrapod exon 21V22, which appears downstream of exon
21, shows an especially high similarity with the teleost
repeat consensus: for example, the subsequence
EYTKVTKVIEGEP from chicken exon 21V22 is 77%
identical to the teleost repeat consensus SITKVTRVIEGEP (rearranged here for a terminal P to align with the
chicken sequence). Thus, exon 21V22 defines the range
of tetrapod exons homologous to the long teleost repeat
exon.

Discussion
The C-terminal region of periostin is likely a key to
disambiguating periostin function

Despite ongoing discussions regarding the periostin
alternatively spliced C-terminal region (e.g. [42,71])
dating back to its original description [1,2], this region
has not been target of in-depth analyses to identify its
biological function. Here, we presented evidence for its
universally high degree of variability in a phylogenetic
context, which we hope will assist future research on
periostin. We laid out the multiplicity and, within the
euteleostomes, phylogenetic universality of modalities
observed (including alternative splicing as well as genomically encoded variable exon counts and lengths) to
modify this part of periostin. Considering also that the
functionally distinct periostin paralog TGFBI lacks an
equivalent to periostin’s C-terminal region, we propose
that this region is of functional relevance, and that the
sequence variation imparted by alternative splicing
could be a modulator of periostin function.
In studies aimed at elucidating determinants of tumorsuppressive properties of periostin, the periostin C-terminal region was found to be sufficient to suppress anchorage-independent growth in T24 bladder cancer cells
[72], to suppress cell invasiveness in SBT31A bladder
cancer cells, and to abrogate the metastatic potential of
highly metastatic B16F10 mouse melanoma cells in an
in vivo assay [42]. While the tumor-suppressive properties documented for periostin in these studies remain to
be reconciled with a large body of literature describing
periostin as tumor promoting, these results demonstrate
the functional significance of the periostin C-terminal

Page 14 of 19

region as a whole. This notion is also playing out in discussions in literature not explicitly concerned with
decoding periostin function on the sequence or domain
level. For example, the significance of a recent high-profile study on periostin as a potential therapeutic target
after heart attack [73] has been questioned on the basis
of this work being partly based on a version of periostin
lacking the C-terminal region [13,25,74].
The situation is more complex when it comes to different periostin splicing isoforms characterized by individual presence or absence of cassette exons 17 - 21
(human and mouse). For the following discussion, we
are using a notation of exon numbers preceded with a
minus sign in superscript to characterize periostin isoforms by their absent exons relative to a full-length periostin, denoted POSTN fl , with a full complement of
exons, i.e. 23 for human and mouse.
Based on the common occurrence of gel pictures
showing multiple periostin bands throughout the literature [e.g. 2,4,15,17,25,29,75,76], we can assume that studies on native periostin typically deal with a mixture of
isoforms, although the exact number is usually
unknown. In apparent agreement with the number of
four isoforms originally reported [2], most gels show a
cluster of 4 or sometimes 5 periostin bands. However,
the similar length of the alternatively spliced exons gives
rise to possible combinations that are very close in size,
so that the actual number is potentially higher due to
isoforms co-migrating in the same band. Indeed, studies
have found higher isoform counts, for example 6 in
human kidney cancer [76] and more than 8 in human
breast tissue (Hoersch et al: Alternative splicing of periostin in human breast cancer, manuscript in preparation), and in both cases, gel pictures allowed distinction
of only four or five variants.
Descriptions of experimental procedures manipulating
periostin in some way, for example expressing in ectopically in a cell line, are not always explicit on the specific
isoform used, and the attributes “full-length” or “wild
type” are not always or unambiguously referring to the
isoform with all exons present. In some instances, the
relevant isoform can be traced via database accession
numbers provided, but overall, this information is not
consistently enough available to enable a meaningful
isoform-specific meta-analysis.
More interestingly, biological observations regarding
periostin have, in some cases, been explicitly tied to specific variants, as illustrated by the following three
examples.
(i) In a study on periostin expression in bone [71], the
designation “periostin-like factor” or “PLF” was introduced by the authors specifically for periostin isoform
POSTN-21 , while the designation “periostin” refers to
isoform POSTN-17 in the same study. Using the same

Hoersch and Andrade-Navarro BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:30
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/30

designations, this group subsequently described differential spatiotemporal expression patterns of these two isoforms in the developing mouse embryo [77], although it
has to be understood that the “isoform-specific antibodies” used in this work are technically only site-specific
for exons 21 and 17, respectively, and could, in principle, report on multiple isoforms characterized by exon
17 or exon 21 presence.
(ii) Differential expression profiles over time were
observed for different periostin isoforms after a myocardial infarct event in periostin-null mice, with isoform
POSTN-17-21 being expressed strongest initially and then
becoming weaker after a sustained period of high
expression as the expression level of other isoforms gradually increased [14].
(iii) In a continuation of earlier work, it was found
that periostin isoforms POSTNfl and POSTN-17-21 abrogate invasion in cell lines B16F10 and SBT991 and in
vivo lung metastasis of B16F10 cells in mice, while isoform POSTN-17-18-21 does not [51]. Along similar lines,
but with opposite directionality, isoform-specific differences in the ability to promote migration and invasion
were observed in breast cancer cells (Hoersch et al:
Alternative splicing of periostin in human breast cancer,
manuscript in preparation).
Apart from the often implicit issue of periostin isoform expression, several aspects of periostin are controversially described and discussed in the literature to
date, prominently among them: (i) periostin subcellular
localization, (ii) the cell types responsible for periostin
expression and the physiological sites of periostin protein localization post secretion, and (iii), in the cancer
literature, periostin function being tumor promoting or
suppressing.
It will be interesting to see to what extent the variability of periostin isoform expression will contribute to
resolving these issues, a possibility that is commonly
raised in discussion sections in the periostin literature.
Given the sequence and predicted structural similarities
between periostin’s cassette exons due to the underlying
repeat structure laid out in this study, we detail below a
functional interpretation that employs a dose-type rationale, i.e. a binding interaction as a function effectively
tuned by exon count. This seems more compelling to us
than a purely exon-specific mechanism, although the
reality may well be a complex overlay of both
mechanisms.
The periostin C-terminal region exhibits exceptional
transcriptional and genomic variability

We demonstrated the homology of periostin’s multiexon C-terminal region in tetrapods and its C-terminal
region in teleosts, where a 13 amino acid sequence is
stacked into adjacent repeats. The majority of these is,
in most of the teleost species studied, concentrated in

Page 15 of 19

one exon that is unusually large (dubbed “exon 18=19”
in this work).
The absence of protein domain signatures in periostin’s C-terminal region is thus no longer puzzling. We
can assume that this region as observed today evolved
from an ancestor repeat region, leading to its distribution over multiple exons, particularly in tetrapod species.
We demonstrated that the periostin C-terminal region
is showing increased evolutionary plasticity relative to
the remainder of the gene. This is evident from comparing branch lengths of phylogenetic trees based on separate sequence alignments of the C-terminal region and
of the remainder of the gene (Figure 4B). Moreover, it is
reinforced by the variability we found almost exclusively
for periostin’s C-terminal regions between different taxa
that are not even reflected in these dendrograms: profoundly different exon structure (teleosts vs. tetrapods),
marked divergence between the two periostin copies in
teleosts, variable exon length (exon 17 across euteleostomes, exon 18=19 in teleosts), an additional exon not
previously described (exon 21V22 in tetrapods except
placental mammals), and additional genomic copies of
exon 19 with a strong developmental implication (in
frogs).
We also reported that alternative splicing is a universal hallmark of the periostin C-terminal region. While
long established for human and murine periostin, we
found evidence for alternative splicing events affecting
multiple exons in periostin’s C-terminal regions in all
organisms studied here (including teleost fish) for which
non-trivial amounts of transcript sequence data were
publicly available. Exons 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, and 21V22
are all alternatively spliced cassette exons, although it
appears that in any given species, at least one of them is
constitutively expressed. Although uncertainties remain
in some cases due to low sequence coverage, the predicted alternative splicing patterns were found to vary
by species, sometimes subtly so (e.g. in human and
mouse with regard to exon 20).
Taken together, these observations point to periostin’s
C-terminal region being exceptionally dynamic on different scales. On a transcriptional scale, alternative splicing could give rise to periostin variants in a tissue,
development, or disease process dependent manner, the
functional impact of which is only beginning to emerge.
On a genomic, i.e., evolutionary scale, the increased
plasticity of this region leads to periostin configurations
that are specific to taxonomic lineages or groups.
The periostin C-terminal region and neofunctionalization

We understand this increased evolutionary plasticity as a
manifestation of neofunctionalization [78] affecting euteleostome periostin where we observe variations in exon
length, count, structure, and variable splicing patterns in
the C-terminal region. We hypothesize that the repeats

Hoersch and Andrade-Navarro BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:30
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/30

were acquired as de novo sequence in an exonization
event [79], either by ancestral periostin (after the periostin/TGFBI split) or by the common periostin/TGFBI
ancestor gene, in which case the repeats were lost by
TGFBI after the split.
Data available at this time is insufficient to distinguish
between these two possibilities, chiefly because of the
preliminary nature of relevant genome assemblies outside the euteleostomes (for details and Figures, see
Additional file 6). This newly exonized repeat sequence
was then relatively free to evolve, while the remainder of
the gene remained much more conserved due to the
structural and functional constraints imposed by the
EMI and FAS1 domains.
Remarkably, our observations concerning the two
periostin copies in teleost fish point to the same
mechanism of neofunctionalization playing out here.
Between the two periostin copies in teleosts, we are
again seeing variations in exon length, count, and structure. In addition, to the extent that the EST record can
serve as a guide, the expression level difference between
the two periostin copies in teleosts might be speciesspecific (zebrafish and stickleback, Additional file 1,
Table S1).
It is interesting to speculate that periostin’s C-terminal
region and its high evolutionary plasticity may explain
why periostin, but not TGFBI, is duplicated in teleosts.
The absence of a second TGFBI copy in teleosts might
reflect the limited freedom of TGFBI to functionally differentiate from the “primary” copy due to the constraints imposed by the EMI and FAS1 domains, leading
to loss of the redundant, if not harmful, second copy. By
contrast, periostin’s C-terminal region could be instrumental for the rapid evolvement of a functional role sufficiently distinct from the periostin paralog in question.
Additional file 6 summarizes further aspects of periostin’s C-terminal region in particular and the periostin/
TGFBI paralogy in general, placing periostin and TGFBI
into a larger framework of chordate evolution.
Interpretations of the secondary structure prediction
results for periostin’s C-terminal region

Through secondary structure prediction on periostin’s
C-terminal region from seven tetrapod and two teleost
species, we found consecutive beta strands as the predominant structural feature of this region, specifically, one
beta strand per repeat unit. For tetrapods, this means
that generally two beta strands are encoded per exon.
The universal splicing variations and the genomic
variability observed across and between species could, in
principle, point to a functional differentiation of the Cterminal region of periostin. This interpretation is especially attractive in the light of both literature reporting
isoform-specific findings and our observation of the
eight additional genomic copies of exon 19 in X.

tropicalis, the expression of which might be tied to
developmental stage, specifically (pre)metamorphic animals, according to EST data.
The extracellular matrix is rich in potential interaction
and binding partners for periostin, a few of which have
been elucidated in some detail. Most prominent among
these are a number of integrins (e.g. [29-32]). Heparin
binding has been shown, possibly mediated by a CardinWeintraub consensus sequence [37,80] encoded by exon
23.
More recently, periostin binding to collagen I was
reported in the context of a phenotypic characterization
of periostin-null mice [35], but the binding mechanism
was not described. Similarly, periostin binding with
fibronectin was observed, but not explained on a molecular or structural basis [38].
Since collagen and fibronectin binding have not been
described for TGFBI, the periostin paralog lacking an
extended and variable C-terminal region, we hypothesize
that periostin might interact with these proteins in this
region. Collagen I - fibronectin binding has recently been
elucidated in complexes of two or four sequential fibronectin FN1 or FN2 domains, components of a fibronectin
region called “gelatin-binding domain”, with peptides
from the collagen I a1 or a2 chain. With the two fibronectin domains in question being beta-sandwich structures, the collagen peptides assume, in the complex, a
beta strand conformation with anti-parallel orientation to
one of the FN domain beta strands (beta-zipper) [81].
This mode of binding is similar to earlier descriptions
of the way bacterial cell wall proteins from Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes attach to human
fibronectin [82,83]: Here, bacterial repeats were found
to form a tandem beta-zipper with two fibronectin FN1
domains. This finding and the repetitive arrangement of
both the bacterial units and the FN1 domains then led
the authors to propose a model of an extended beta-zipper, involving a larger number of FN1 domains and bacterial repeats. Therefore, since the periostin’s C-terminal
region has repeats reminiscent of these bacterial repeats,
we hypothesize that they may assume a structure of
multiple consecutive beta strands when binding to
sequential beta strand elements of fibronectin domains
(and possibly other ECM proteins) by way of an
extended beta-zipper.
In such a model, the strength of this interaction would
be influenced by the number of beta strands available
for binding with - in the case of fibronectin - maximally
11 available sequential FN1/FN2 domains in the Nterminal region. The number of available beta strands
from periostin’s side is a function of exon count, which
is in turn determined - and, in this model, calibrated or
tuned - by alternative splicing as well as lineage-specific
differences.

Conclusions
We believe that this study marks an important contribution to periostin research. Despite the considerable
increase in published literature since periostin’s discovery in an osteoblast cell line in 1993, especially over the
past few years, some aspects have remained poorly
understood. This paper provides evolutionary context
for periostin’s enigmatic C-terminal region and argues
that it is likely key to a detailed understanding and disambiguation of periostin function, which is subject to
some controversy in present literature. We put forward
a number of findings and interpretations that will hopefully be taken on in further studies and experimentally
in the future. We believe that our secondary structure
prediction, the finding of additional genomic exon 19
copies in X. tropicalis, and the duplication of periostin
in teleosts are particularly rewarding experimental
targets.
Finally, we note that this work has benefited greatly
from the growing collection of whole-genome sequences
available, without which it would have been impossible
in its present form. At the same time, it strongly supports the argument not only for continued new genome
sequencing, especially of strategically selected representatives from key phyla, but importantly also for a sustained effort to finish, at least to a reasonable degree,
existing draft assemblies. While it will not be practical
in all cases to arrive at high-quality chromosome-bychromosome assemblies that are subject to sustained
curation efforts, highly fragmented genome sequences
render detailed gene-level analyses impossible, or at
least severely limit the power of their results. Some
aspects of our work remained incomplete, mirroring the
unfinished state of key genome assemblies, for example
within the teleosts, but especially outside the euteleostome group.
