Unraveling the rapid radiation of crested newts
(Triturus cristatus superspecies) using complete
mitogenomic sequences
Ben Wielstra1,2* and Jan W Arntzen2

Abstract
Background: The rapid radiation of crested newts (Triturus cristatus superspecies) comprises four morphotypes:
1) the T. karelinii group, 2) T. carnifex - T. macedonicus, 3) T. cristatus and 4) T. dobrogicus. These vary in body build
and the number of rib-bearing pre-sacral vertebrae (NRBV). The phylogenetic relationships of the morphotypes
have not yet been settled, despite several previous attempts, employing a variety of molecular markers. We here
resolve the crested newt phylogeny by using complete mitochondrial genome sequences.
Results: Bayesian inference based on the mitogenomic data yields a fully bifurcating, significantly supported tree,
though Maximum Likelihood inference yields low support values. The internal branches connecting the
morphotypes are short relative to the terminal branches. Seen from the root of Triturus (NRBV = 13), a basal
dichotomy separates the T. karelinii group (NRBV = 13) from the remaining crested newts. The next split divides
the latter assortment into T. carnifex - T. macedonicus (NRBV = 14) versus T. cristatus (NRBV = 15) and T. dobrogicus
(NRBV = 16 or 17).
Conclusions: We argue that the Bayesian full mitochondrial DNA phylogeny is superior to previous attempts
aiming to recover the crested newt species tree. Furthermore, our new phylogeny involves a maximally
parsimonious interpretation of NRBV evolution. Calibrating the phylogeny allows us to evaluate potential drivers for
crested newt cladogenesis. The split between the T. karelinii group and the three other morphotypes, at ca. 10.4
Ma, is associated with the separation of the Balkan and Anatolian landmasses (12-9 Ma). No currently known
vicariant events can be ascribed to the other two splits, first at ca. 9.3 Ma, separating T. carnifex - T. macedonicus,
and second at ca. 8.8 Ma, splitting T. cristatus and T. dobrogicus. The crested newt morphotypes differ in the
duration of their annual aquatic period. We speculate on the role that this ecological differentiation could have
played during speciation.

Background
Understanding the temporal framework in which species
have originated is fundamental to historical biogeography and evolutionary studies. However, obtaining a reliable phylogeny for a model system is not always
straightforward. Rapid radiations are notoriously difficult
in this respect, and the older the radiation, the more
pronounced the problem will be [1]. The crested newt

is an example of a relatively old, rapid radiation, for
which it has proved problematic to obtain a resolved
phylogenetic tree.
The crested newt superspecies encompasses four morphological groups, hereafter referred to as ‘morphotypes’.
Ordered from a stocky build with sturdy limbs, to slender
with small limbs, via two intermediate stages, these are:
1) the T. karelinii group, 2) T. carnifex - T. macedonicus,
3) T. cristatus and 4) T. dobrogicus. The morphotypes are
characterized by discrete differences in the number of
rib-bearing pre-sacral vertebrae (NRBV) [2]. The typical
NRBV count is 13 for the T. karelinii group, 14 for T.
carnifex - T. macedonicus, 15 for T. cristatus and 16 or
17 for T. dobrogicus. The marbled newts, T. marmoratus

and T. pygmaeus, which make up the crested newts’ sister
group, have the heaviest body build in the genus and possess a typical NRBV count of 12. Over ninety per cent of
these newts can be correctly identified based on NRBV
counts alone; interspecific hybridization along parapatric
contact zones (Figure 1) is suggested to account for most
of the remaining intraspecific variation [2-4]. Crested
newt morphology has been interpreted as reflecting phylogeny [2]. A maximally parsimonious interpretation of
NRBV (interpreting the ancestral crested newt body
shape as relatively robust and the more slender body
shapes as derived) suggests a branching order as shown
in Figure 2a.
With the advent of molecular techniques, independent
data became available and multiple molecular markers
have now been employed to attempt to resolve the crested
newt phylogeny. Based on restriction fragment length
polymorphism of the mitochondrial genome (employing
eleven restriction enzymes), a polytomy was found (Figure
2b) [5]. Similarly, analysis of a suite of forty enzyme loci
and 642 bp of mitochondrial sequence data resulted in a
polytomous relationship for the four morphotypes (Figure
2b) [6]. A polytomy could simply reflect a lack of

phylogenetic resolution in the data. However, as the different datasets both pointed towards a polytomy, it was suggested that the four crested newt morphotypes truly split
practically simultaneously [6].
A later effort using sequence data of five nuclear DNA
(2589 bp) and two mitochondrial DNA markers (1747 bp)
revealed a more varied picture [7]. An analysis using the
sequence data concatenated found a fully bifurcating and
significantly supported phylogeny (Figure 2c). There are,
however, theoretical objections to data concatenation, as
this method does not consider the unique topological history that each individual gene possesses [8]. Therefore, phylogenetic inference was also carried out using a hierarchical
Bayesian analysis, which does explicitly take the effects of
gene tree heterogeneity into account. This analysis indeed
produced different results. Based on the five nuclear DNA
markers, a fourfold polytomy was found again (Figure 2b).
This fourfold polytomy could be expanded to a trichotomy
by incorporating the mitochondrial DNA data, but the single sister relationship found was incongruent with the data
concatenation approach (Figure 2d).
Previous molecular studies have firmly established that
the crested newt radiation occurred in a brief time

T. carnifex - T. macedonicus (node II) versus T. cristatus
and T. dobrogicus (node III). Posterior probabilities are
≥ 0.95 (Table 2). Although Maximum Likelihood inference yields the same branching order and similar branch
lengths (tree not shown), the bootstrap support values
for two of the three nodes associated with radiation of
crested newt morphotypes (nodes II and III) are low
(Table 2). The mitogenomic phylogeny is characterized
by long terminal branches, which are connected by
short internal branches. The three nodes connecting the
crested newt morphotypes represent a narrow time window (approximately 10.4-8.8 Ma) and have small confidence intervals, independent of dating method used
(Table 2). Three character state transitions are required
to explain the NRBV differentiation across the four
crested newt morphotypes, two of which are situated on
short internal branches (Figure 3).

interval. However, they yielded conflicting phylogenetic
hypotheses and have been unable to settle the relationship among the morphotypes. Furthermore, all phylogenetic hypotheses found so far are in conflict with the
tree suggested by morphology. In this study we further
explore the crested newt phylogeny, this time employing
complete mitogenomic sequences. As the mitochondrial
genome contains tenfold the bp studied up to now
(~17 Kbp vs. ~1.7 Kbp), it is a promising source of phylogenetic resolution (cf. [9]). We here analyse nine
newly-sequenced mitogenomes, representing all Triturus
species, and manage to obtain a fully-resolved crested
newt phylogeny. We discuss this new phylogeny with
respect to previous attempts to obtain the Triturus tree
and speculate on causes for cladogenesis.

Results
We present a mitogenomic Triturus phylogeny (Figure
3) based on a division of the mitogenomic sequence
data into 42 data partitions, as this partitioning strategy
is preferred over the simpler ones tested (Table 1).
Bayesian inference identifies a basal dichotomy in the
crested newt superspecies between the T. karelinii
group and the other morphotypes (node I in Figure 3).
The next bifurcation divides the latter assortment in

The full mitogenomic dataset has provided the phylogenetic resolution that the crested newt case required. Previous approaches using only part of the mitochondrial
genome found a polytomy for the four morphotypes, but
based on the full mitochondrial DNA sequences we managed to resolve this polytomy. Under Bayesian inference,
we find a fully bifurcating phylogeny, with significant support for the three nodes connecting the four crested newt
morphotypes (i.e. nodes I-III in Figure 3 and Table 2). In
comparison, Maximum Likelihood bootstrapping finds
equivocal results for two of the three nodes (nodes II and
III). Disparity in support values between both methods is
known to occur at short internodes, where Bayesian inference appears to better exploit the relatively small number
of informative characters [10]. Our confidence in the
Bayesian phylogeny is increased by its correspondence to
the branching order suggested by a maximally parsimonious interpretation of NRBV evolution (Figure 2a and 3).
The mitochondrial genome, given its non-recombining
nature, behaves as a single gene and, due to stochasticity
in the coalescent process, the branching order it suggests
is not necessarily congruent with the true species tree [11].
The motivation behind studying independent gene trees
(i.e. multiple nuclear genetic markers) is that these should
ultimately converge upon the overarching species tree [8].
However, a recent hierarchical Bayesian analysis based on
five nuclear markers did not yield a resolved crested newt
phylogeny [7]. This lack of resolution could be explained
by the rapidness of the radiation of the crested newt morphotypes, as repeated cladogenesis within the temporal
domain of the lineage sorting process increases the chance
of a mismatch between gene trees and species tree
[1,8,11-13]. Such a risk of gene tree - species tree discordance is smaller for the mitochondrial genome, because

lineage sorting is realized faster compared to the nuclear
genome (given the fourfold smaller effective population
size of the mitochondrial genome due to haploid and uniparental inheritance [14,15]).
We do not claim that our current attempt resolves the
crested newt species tree once and for all; studying a
much larger battery of nuclear DNA markers than previously used is required to further home in on the
crested newt species tree [12]. However, considering the
data currently available, we suggest that the Bayesian
mitogenomic phylogeny as yet provides the most reliable
estimation of the crested newt species tree. We here

We here concentrate on the three splits which gave rise
to the four crested newt morphotypes (i.e. nodes I-III in
Figure 3); for vicariant events underlying the three splits
within morphotypes (i.e. nodes c-e in Figure 3), see
[6,16]. An earlier attempt to reconstruct the historical
biogeography of crested newts assumed a ‘hard’ polytomous relationship for the four morphotypes [6]. In
effect, a temporal estimate was only provided for the
crown of the crested newts and proposed vicariant
events were derived from this date.
The present study has resolved the relationships
among the morphotypes (i.e. the polytomy in [6] turned
out to be ‘soft’ after all). In line with the increased phylogenetic resolution, more recent dates are appointed to
the newly resolved nodes and their morphotype lineages.
The crested newt crown, i.e. the split between the
T. karelinii group and the remaining crested newts
(node I in Figure 3), is dated at ca. 10.4 Ma. The origin
of the Aegean Sea at 12-9 Ma [17], which separated the
Balkan Peninsula from Anatolia, is a likely underlying
vicariant event (sensu [6]). No obvious vicariant events
can be associated with the two splits that gave rise to
the three remaining morphotypes [18]: the separation of
T. carnifex - T. macedonicus versus T. cristatus and
T. dobrogicus (node II) at approximately 9.3 Ma and the
split between T. cristatus and T. dobrogicus (node III)
around 8.8 Ma (contra [6]).
No comprehensive paleogeographical reconstructions
are as yet available for the Balkan Peninsula in the period
between 11 and 8.5 Ma [18]. It is feasible that vicariant
events relevant to the crested newt case have yet to be
discovered. As a way forward, we suggest that more taxa
with Balkan distributions should be surveyed in a historical biogeographical context [6,19]. By uncovering congruent spatio-temporal signatures, such studies should
assist in paleogeographical reconstruction of the Balkan
Peninsula. This strategy might not be so straightforward;
genetic structuring in the two other groups of newts that
occur on the Balkan Peninsula (Ichthyosaura and Lissotriton), though relatively old, originated considerably
more recent than that in the crested newts [20,21].
Could ecological divergence have played a role in crested
newt speciation?

The role of ecological divergence in historical biogeography is often regarded as passive; external factors such as
geology and climate are considered to be responsible for
the actual dividing of ancestral stocks and potential ecological divergence occurs at a later point [22]. However,
ecology can play an active role in the speciation process:
disruptive selection along an ecological gradient can
result in restrictions to gene flow, in the absence of geographical isolation [22-25]. Could such a parapatric
mode of speciation apply to the crested newt case?

Page 5 of 8

The crested newt morphotypes do show ecological differentiation in the time they annually spend in the water.
The duration of the annual aquatic period is three months
in the T. karelinii group, four in T. carnifex, five in T. cristatus and six in T. dobrogicus [4]. Crested newts thus
show a correlation between phenotype and phenology:
sturdy bodies and a low NRBV count are associated with a
more terrestrial way of life and slender bodies and a high
NRBV count with a more aquatic life style [4]. This notion
of a terrestrial versus aquatic trade-off associated with
body shape is further supported by the even more robust
marbled newt T. marmoratus, whose two-month aquatic
phase is the shortest of the Triturus newts [6].
The body shape differentiation in crested newts
occurred over a brief timespan (Figure 3 and Table 2): at
least two of the three NRBV additions during crested newt
evolution are associated with short internal branches.
Under the assumption that today’s phenology-phenotype
correlation has been valid through time, the ecological
divergence of the crested newt morphotypes must have
similarly taken place over a short period. Considering the
fundamental role water bodies play in amphibian reproduction [26], it is reasonable to suggest that differences in
the availability of standing water would present different
adaptive peaks. The time frame of the crested newt radiation corresponds to a period of increased seasonality in
Eurasia during the Late Miocene (11.6-5.3 Ma), associated
with the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau, which led to a more
heterogeneous landscape in terms of humidity [27].
With a clear speciation scenario involving vicariance
lacking, we, as an alternative hypothesis, suggest that
the crested newts’ body shape differentiation reflects a
rapid adaptive radiation to different water regimes. It
should be noted that these two hypotheses are not
necessarily mutually exclusive.
Reflections on NRBV and its adaptive value in Triturus

Salamanders have become a model group to understand
patterns of morphological evolution [28]. Variation of
salamander body shape has been accomplished by modifying the vertebral column, by either altering the length
of the individual vertebrae or by changing the total
number of vertebrae [29]. Interestingly, the intrageneric
range in NRBV count shown by Triturus is unprecedented in Salamandridae (see Additional file 1), suggesting body shape plasticity played a prominent role during
crested newt evolution. Work on the genetic pathways
underlying the evolutionary development of the different
Triturus morphotypes will provide more insight into
this phenomenon (J.M. Ziermann et al., in prep.).
What could be the adaptive value of the crested newt
NRBV radiation? The dualism of an amphibian lifestyle
poses conflicting demands on body shape. The rapid
adaptive radiation scenario we propose for the crested

Wielstra and Arntzen BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:162
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/162

newts, suggests that the balance struck for this trade-off
differs among the morphotypes, due to the different
ecological background each of them experiences. What
do we currently understand about the differential performance of the morphotypes in the aquatic and the terrestrial environment? Although [30] found that Triturus
stockiness is positively correlated with running speed,
this is not so for slenderness and swimming speed.
What could be the reason for this partially unexpected
result? Maybe ‘speed’ is not the most suitable way to
characterize terrestrial or aquatic specialization? Perhaps
body elongation benefits more aquatic Triturus newts
some other way, e.g. by increasing maneuverability or by
providing more space for egg production [30]? More
research is required to elucidate the adaptive value of
the different Triturus body shapes against distinct ecological backgrounds.

Conclusions
Although it has proven difficult to resolve the rapid
radiation of crested newts, by employing full mitochondrial DNA sequence data we now have a precise estimate
of the chronology of branching events. The relationship
among the four crested newt morphotypes found agrees
with a maximally parsimonious interpretation of NRBV
evolution, increasing our confidence in the accuracy of
the branching order. The basal dichotomy sorting out the
crested newt morphotypes can be associated with a major
vicariant event, but we cannot pinpoint drivers for the
other two splits sorting out the morphotypes. We propose that (as yet) undiscovered vicariant events and/or
ecological divergence (reflected by body shape differentiation) resulted in a disruption of gene flow. Crested
newts are a suitable model to study eco-evo-devo in a
rapid radiation and the new phylogenetic framework presented here serves as a baseline for future research.
Methods
Samples

We included seven crested newts (see Additional file 2),
representing all recognized species, as well as three distinct mitochondrial DNA clades that constitute the T.
karelinii group (cf. [16]). We follow [16] in awaiting a
taxonomic revision of the T. karelinii group before applying specific names to the three constituent mitochondrial
DNA clades (the name T. karelinii sensu stricto would
apply to the ‘eastern clade’ and T. arntzeni has been
applied to the ‘western clade’; no name has as yet been
proposed for the ‘central clade’). We also sequenced the
two marbled newts (T. marmoratus and T. pygmaeus),
the remaining members of the genus Triturus, to function as outgroup taxa. Additionally, we added a sequence
of Calotriton asper, sister to the genus Triturus, available
from [31] (GenBank accession number EU880307).

Sequences

The complete mitogenomes of the nine Triturus newts
were sequenced in fifteen overlapping parts. We followed
the laboratory protocol of [31] and designed more specific
and/or internal primers where required (detailed in Additional file 3). Cycle sequencing was done commercially
through Macrogen Inc. Forward and reverse sequences
were checked by eye and consensus sequences were compiled with Sequencher 4.5 (Gene Codes Corporation). The
fifteen fragments per individual were manually aligned and
merged in MacClade 4.08 [32]. The length of the resulting
sequences ranged from 16,424 to 16,649 bp. The Triturus
mitogenomes are composed of thirteen protein-coding
genes, twenty-two transfer RNA genes, two ribosomal
RNA genes, the D-loop, and a non-coding region (which
is highly variable in length) and gene order is identical to
that found in the rest of the family Salamandridae (cf.
[31]). The newly produced mitogenomic sequences have
been submitted to GenBank (accession numbers are noted
in Additional file 2). The 15420 bp data matrix used for
phylogenetic analyses, comprising the ribosomal RNA,
transfer RNA and protein-coding genes, is available from
TreeBASE (study ID S11081).
Data partitioning

We compared four different partitioning strategies for
organizing the mitochondrial sequence data (cf. [33]).
Each partitioning strategy treated the two ribosomal RNA
genes and the concatenated transfer RNA genes as separate partitions. Differences among the partitioning strategies are based on the treatment of the protein-coding
genes, dividing the protein-coding data according to: first,
second and third codon position (6 partitions in total),
each gene (16 partitions); first plus second and third
codon position for each gene (29 partitions); and first, second and third codon position for each gene (42 partitions).
The most appropriate model of sequence evolution for
each data partition was determined with MrModeltest 2.2
[34], based on the Akaike Information Criterion (see Additional file 4). The optimal partitioning scheme was selected
based on the differences in the harmonic mean of the -ln
likelihood scores resulting from the Bayesian phylogenetic
inference. The 2 ln Bayes factors were calculated for each
partitioning strategy by subtracting the score resulting
from simpler partitioning strategies and multiplying the
outcome by -2 [35,36]. A value for 2 ln Bayes factor
exceeding 10 was used as a threshold for preferring the
more complex model [37].
Phylogenetic analyses

Mixed-model Bayesian phylogenetic inference was carried out with MrBayes 3.1.2 [38]. For each data partition
the rate of sequence evolution and parameters were
unlinked. Two simultaneous four chain runs proceeded

Wielstra and Arntzen BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:162
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/162

for one hundred million generations, with a sampling
frequency of 0.001 and a heating parameter of 0.05. The
first half of the sampled trees was discarded as burn-in
and the phylogenetic inference was drawn from the
remaining ‘forest’. Tracer [39] was used to check for stabilization of overall likelihood within and convergence
between runs. Partitioned Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic inference was carried out with RAxML 7.2.7
[40]. Robustness of the tree was tested via 100 bootstrap
replicates. All phylogenetic analyses were carried out via
the CIPRES Science Gateway [41].
Temporal calibration

We used two independent calibration points for molecular dating, one fossil-based and one geology-based (cf.
[16]). A fossil dated at 24 Ma was interpreted as a minimum estimate for the most recent common ancestor of
the genus Triturus (cf. [42]) and the origin of the Adriatic Sea at 5.33 Ma, at the end of the Messinian Salinity
Crisis, was interpreted as the vicariant event causing the
T. carnifex - T. macedonicus split (cf. [6]). Divergence
times were estimated with r8s 1.71 [43] and BEAST
1.5.3 [44]. In r8s we used the penalized-likelihood
approach in combination with the truncated-Newton
algorithm. Calotriton asper was pruned from the dataset,
while keeping the root position, to avoid performing the
time estimation on a basal trichotomy. The optimal
smoothing parameter (S = 1) was determined by a
cross-validation procedure, using the Bayesian consensus
tree as input. Mean temporal estimates and 95% confidence intervals were determined by profiling the last
thousand sampled Bayesian topologies. In BEAST, we
applied the uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock model
and a Yule speciation model. The fixed calibration point
was appointed a normally distributed prior with a small
standard deviation (0.001) and the minimum estimate a
lognormally distributed prior with the default standard
deviation (1.0). The tree resulting from the Bayesian
analysis was used as starting topology. Each data partition was allowed its own model of sequence evolution,
as previously determined with MrModeltest. Divergence
times were estimated based on two independent 100
million generation runs, sampled every 1000 generations, after discarding the first half of generations as
burn-in. Tracer [39] was used to check whether effective
sample sizes were at least 200.
