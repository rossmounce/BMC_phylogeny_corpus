Abstract
Background: Toll-like receptors (TLR) recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns and are
important mediators of the innate immune system. TLR1 and TLR6 are paralogs and located in
tandem on the same chromosome in mammals. They form heterodimers with TLR2 and bind
lipopeptide components of gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial cell walls. To identify
conserved stretches in TLR1 and TLR6, that may be important for their function, we compared
their protein sequences in nine mammalian species(Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes, Macaca mulatta,
Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus; Erinaceus europaeus, Bos Taurus, Sus scrofa and Canis familiaris).
Results: The N-terminal sequences of the orthologous proteins showed greater similarity than
corresponding paralog sequences. However, we identified a region of 300 amino acids towards the
C-terminus of TLR1 and TLR6, where paralogs had a greater degree of sequence identity than
orthologs. Preservation of DNA sequence identity of paralogs in this region was observed in all
nine mammalian species investigated, and is due to independent gene conversion events. The
regions having undergone gene conversion in each species are almost identical and encode the
leucine-rich repeat motifs 16 to 19, the C-terminal cap motif, the transmembrane domain and most
of the intracellular Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain.
Conclusion: Our results show that, for a specific conserved region, divergence of TLR1 and TLR6
is limited by gene conversion, most likely because of the need for co-evolution with multiple
intracellular and extracellular binding partners. Thus, gene conversion provides a mechanism for
limiting the divergence of functional regions of protein paralogs, while allowing other domains to
evolve diversified functions.

Background
The innate immune response is important in the early
stages of defense against bacterial or viral pathogens, and
also for an efficient adaptive immune response [1]. Tolllike receptors (TLR) play a central role in the innate
immune response. They recognize conserved pathogenassociated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as lipopoly-

saccharides (LPS), lipopeptides, flagellins, dsRNA or CpG
DNA motifs. PAMPs are specific for bacteria, viruses and
protozoan parasites [2,3]. The human genome contains
10 different TLRs, and 12 mouse TLRs have been identified. TLRs are type 1 transmembrane proteins, with a large
extracellular domain composed of up to 26 leucine-rich
repeats (LRR) flanked by N-terminal and C-terminal cap

motifs, a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic Toll/
interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain. LRRs are motifs of
20–30 amino acids in length that fold into a horseshoe
shape [4]. They occur in many different proteins and
appear to provide a structural framework for the formation of protein-protein interactions [5]. In TLRs, the LRR
motifs are involved in recognition of PAMPs and in hetero- or homo-dimerization. The TIR domain is highly
conserved and interacts with adapter proteins such as
MyD88 and TIRAP (also known as Mal) [6]. Ligand binding induces homo- or hetero-dimerization of TLRs, and
subsequent recruitment of intracellular adapter proteins.
Via intermediates such as TRAF6, IRAK family proteins
and Ik-kinase family proteins, MAP-kinase signaling cascades and transcription factors including NF-kB family
proteins are activated, which leads to increased expression
of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and adhesion
molecules.
Six major TLR families have been identified in vertebrates;
each TLR family recognizes one class of PAMPs [7]. Members of the TLR1 family, which include TLR1, TLR2 and
TLR6, recognize lipopeptides, components of the cell wall
of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The unique
particularity of this family is that TLR2 forms heterodimers with TLR1 or TLR6. These heterodimers recognize distinct molecular patterns of lipopeptides [8,9] and by
exchanging domains between TLR1 and TLR6 the functional importance of LRR9-12, for discrimination
between di-acyl and tri-acyl lipopeptides, was established
[9].
Phylogenetic and chromosomal analysis suggests that
TLR2 and a TLR1-like gene diverged from an ancestral
gene early in vertebrate evolution [7]. The mammalian
genes for TLR6, TLR1 and TLR10 are located consecutively
on the same chromosome (4p14 in humans) and oriented in the same direction at intergenic distances of only
20 to 30 kilobases [7]. They result from successive tandem
gene duplications of an ancestral gene that first gave rise
to a TLR10 gene and a TLR1-like gene. Subsequent duplication of the TLR1-like gene resulted in the emergence of
TLR1 and TLR6 [7]. The absence of separate TLR6 and
TLR1 genes in the opossum and the platypus suggests that
these paralogs arose by gene duplication after the divergence of placental mammals (eutherians) and marsupials
(metatherians), and before the radiation of the eutherians
(~100 My ago) ([7] and data presented here).
A previous report suggested the presence of coincidental
evolution within the TLR1 family [7]. Furthermore, two
recent studies showed that overall TIR domain sequences
of TLR1 and TLR6 paralogs from three mammalian species clustered together, whereas the amino-terminal part
of TLR1 or TLR6 clustered with their respective orthologs

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/148

[10,11]. To better analyze this phenomenon, we compared the amino acid and DNA sequences of TLR1 and
TLR6 in nine mammalian species to identify conserved
regions that may be important for their functional activities. We found that sequences of the N-terminal domains,
and the extreme C-terminal regions, are in agreement with
divergence of TLR1 and TLR6 in a common ancestor of
modern mammalian lineages. In contrast, for a 300
amino acid intervening sequence, paralogs in the same
species were more similar than ortholog sequences
between species, due to gene conversion events that
occurred independently at the same positions in the
ancestors of the mammals analyzed. This is a striking
example of where gene conversion has enabled conservation of functional features of paralogs while other
domains have evolved novel roles.

Results
Alignment of TLR1 and TLR6 protein sequences
Conservation of amino acid sequence may reflect functional constraints on the evolution of proteins. As TLR1
and TLR6 both interact with lipopeptides, with TLR2 and
with intracellular signal transducers such functional constraints are likely to be important in the evolution of these
TLRs. Here, we conducted a search for conserved amino
acids in TLR1 and TLR6, which may help to identify functionally important sequences. We aligned the amino acid
sequences of TLR1 and TLR6 from nine mammalian species (human, chimpanzee, rhesus monkey, mouse, rat,
hedgehog, cow, swine and dog). The complete alignment
of TLR1 and TLR6 protein sequences, as well as the
domain structure of TLR1 and TLR6, is given [see Additional file 1]. Overall, the average percentage identity for
pairwise comparisons between sequences from the nine
species was 75.5 ± 4.5 (SD) % for TLR1 and 75.2 ± 4.1%
for TLR6. A close inspection of the sequence alignments
revealed three patterns of sequence identity. In one pattern, an amino acid at a particular position of TLR1 was
conserved among the orthologs and different from the
amino acid at the same position in TLR6, and vice versa.
In an alternative pattern, TLR1 and TLR6 from one species
had the same amino acid, which was not necessarily conserved in other species at the same position. Visual inspection of the sequences revealed an abrupt transition from
the first pattern to the second pattern in a region close to
amino acid 436 [for numbering see Additional file 1] and
a reversal to the first pattern near amino acid 745 (Figure
1 and [see Additional file 1]. The second pattern of
sequence identity comprised part of the LRR16 motif, the
LRR17, LRR18, and LRR19 motifs, the C-terminal cap
motif, the transmembrane domain and most of the TIR
domain. In a third pattern, TLR1 and TLR6 sequences had
high overall similarity.

Sequence identity patterns in mammalian TLR1 and TLR6
Sequence identity patterns in mammalian TLR1 and TLR6. Alignment of parts of the TLR1 and TLR6 amino acid
sequences from nine mammalian species: Homo sapiens (HS), Pan troglodytes (PT), Macaca mulatta (Ma), Mus musculus (MM), Rattus norvegicus (RN), Erinaceus europaeus (EE), Bos taurus (BT), Sus scrofa (SS) and Canis familiaris (CF). Amino acids 433 to 473
and 726 to 766 are included as they include the junction sites of three patterns of sequence similarity. The three patterns of
identity observed at a particular position are: A) ortholog sequences are more identical; B) paralog sequences are more identical; C) a high over all sequence identity. Color codes: Pattern A) in light blue (or pink): the same amino acid is conserved in 7
or more of 9 ortholog TLR1 (or TLR6) sequences and present in two or less TLR6 (or TLR1) sequences. Pattern B) in red,
green, dark blue or grey: the sequences of the TLR1 and TLR6 paralogs are identical in at least seven species; these paralog
pairs do not all have the same amino acid at this position. Pattern C) in yellow: the same amino acid is conserved in 14 or more
of the 18 TLR1 and TLR6 sequences, patterns A or B do not apply. For the same analysis for the full length TLR1 and TLR6 proteins [see Additional Figure 1].

To determine whether these patterns were significant, we
made a pairwise analysis for percentage sequence identity
of the TLR1 and TLR6 sequences from one primate species
(Homo sapiens), one rodent species (Mus musculus) and
from hedgehog, cow, swine and dog. For the full length
molecules, and for the regions 1–436 and 746-end, we
observed that the average percentage sequence identity of
the orthologous TLR1 or TLR6 sequences was significantly
higher (p values ranging from < 0.01 to < 0.0001) than the
average percentage sequence identity of the paralogous
TLR1 and TLR6 sequence of the same species, whereas the
reverse was true for the region 437–745 (p < 0.0001) [see
Additional file 2].
Analysis for gene conversion
To determine if the results for the region 437–745 could
have been due to gene conversion, we created phylogenetic trees using DNA sequences encoding the full-length
molecules and the different regions of sequence pattern
described above (Figure 2); similar trees were observed
when protein sequences were used (data not shown). Phylogenetic trees for DNA sequences encoding full length
TLR1 or TLR6, as well as amino acid region 1–436 were
concordant with a model in which TLR1 and TLR6 independently evolved from a common TLR1-like ancestor.
The tree structure was compatible with the known evolutionary relationships among the mammalian species.

By contrast, for the DNA region encoding amino acids
437–745, the phylogenetic trees implied DNA transfer
from TLR1 to TLR6 (or vice versa) by gene conversion
independently occurring in the common ancestor of the
primates and in the other six mammalian species (Figure
2). A closer analysis of the primate sequences gave some
evidence for a gene conversion event occurring in this
region after divergence of rhesus monkeys and the common ancestor of chimpanzees and humans, but branch
lengths are too short to give reliable results. For the DNA
region encoding amino acids 746-end, no clear phylogenetic relationships could be established. The rodent, dog
and primate sequences of TLR1 and TLR6 clustered separately, whereas the cow, pig and hedgehog sequences of
TLR1 and TLR6 clustered together (Figure 2). The phylogenetic tree for the first 300 bp of the 3' non-translated
region was similar to that of the region encoding amino
acid 1–436 (data not shown). Taken together, these data
are compatible with independent gene conversion events
starting in a region near the codon of amino acid 436 and
ending, in all mammals, between the codon for amino
acid 746 and the stop codon.
To further establish whether gene conversion has
occurred, and identify the boundaries for each species, we
made an analysis using the Geneconv program [12]
(Table 1). As gene conversion between the TLR1 and TLR6

segment (nucleotide 1282 to 2208) the paralog TLR1 and
TLR6 cluster together, whereas for the full length sequence

gene can only occur during meiotic division in the ancestor of a species, and not between species, we made a pairwise comparison of TLR1 and TLR6 sequences within each
species. The results were highly significant (with p values
ranging from 3.3 × 10-37 to 3.5 × 10-74). The inferred
boundaries for gene conversion started between nucleotide 1284 and 1306, which are within 25 bp downstream
of the nucleotide position 1281 that was inferred by visual
inspection of the protein sequences. For seven mammalian species the inferred 3' boundaries were situated
between nucleotide 2204 and 2220, which is within 12 bp
upstream of position 2208, inferred from the protein
sequences. The inferred ends for the gene conversion fragments were 2287 for the cow TLR1/TLR6 sequences and
2313 for the pig sequences (Table 1).
To further discriminate whether the results described were
due to gene conversion rather than convergent evolution
we performed an analysis of codon usage for the con-

served amino acids. Indeed, amino acid sequences that
remained invariant through evolution or became identical through convergent evolution are less likely to be
encoded by the same triplets than sequences that became
identical after gene conversion. Overall the TLR1 and
TLR6 paralogs share 66% amino acid identity [see Additional file 2]. Analysis of codon usage for conserved
amino acids in TLR1 and TLR6 showed that on average
identical codons were significantly (p < 0.0001) more frequently used to encode conserved amino acids in the
region 437 to 744 (96.3 ± 1.7%) than in the regions
encoding amino acids 1–436 (56.2 ± 3.5%) or 745 to end

evidence for gene conversion between the genes for TLR10

scrofa sequences, which is ancestral to the gene conversion
events between TLR1 and TLR6 in these species, no evidence for gene conversion was observed [see Additional
file 3].
TLR7 and TLR 8 share a common locus on the X-chromosome. We analyzed these genes, but observed no evidence
for gene conversion (data not shown).

Discussion
By comparing the ortholog and paralog protein sequences
from a large number of species, functionally important
sequences may be identified. Here, we made a comparative analysis of protein and coding DNA sequences of
TLR1 and TLR6 from nine mammalian species, representing the mammalian orders primates, rodentia, insectivora, artiodactyla and carnivora. At the time of writing
this article no complete sequence information for TLR1 or
TLR6 was available for mammals representing other
mammalian orders. We identified a 300 amino acid
stretch near the C-terminal end of the proteins in which
TLR1 and TLR6 from the same species were on average
more than 96% identical, whereas orthologs of TLR1 and
TLR6 were only 80% identical in this region (p < 0.0001).
Our analyses show that the high degree of sequence identity between TLR1 and TLR6 from the same species is due
to gene conversion that had independently occurred in six
mammalian species and in an ancestor of three primates.
Our data confirm and extend results of recent phylogenetic analyses showing that overall TIR domain sequences
of TLR1 and TLR6 paralogs from three mammalian species clustered together, whereas the amino-terminal part
of TLR1 or TLR6 or TIR domain sequences of other TLR
genes clustered with their respective orthologs [10,11].
Our results show that the same applies not only for TIR
domains of representatives of several other mammalian
orders, but also that the boundaries for gene conversion
are located at highly conserved positions. The region
homogenized by gene conversion corresponds to the last
four LRR motifs, the C-terminal cap, the transmembrane
domain and three quarters of the TIR domain. We have no
clear explanation as to why the boundaries of gene conversion are so highly conserved in most of the species.
One explanation might be that the segments that were the
subject of gene conversion lie directly adjacent to the segments that have TLR1- or TLR6-specific functions. Alternatively, the genes of both TLR1 and TLR6 might contain
short conserved DNA segments that are particularly prone
to gene conversion; co-evolution with common binding
partners of TLR1 or TLR6 would then result in the preferential selection of the optimal intervening sequence.
Gene conversion is a common event in evolution and is a
powerful means to restrain the divergence of paralog
sequences. It appears to be favored when paralogs are

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/148

located on the same chromosome at distances of less than
55 kb [13], as is the case for TLR1 and TLR6. Gene duplication and gene conversion in six mammalian species
have shaped the paired immunoglobulin-like receptor
(PILR) locus, which encodes regulators of the innate and
adaptive immune systems with PILRA being an inhibitory
receptor, and PILRB, its activating counterpart [14]. In a
striking example of concerted evolution, EMR2, a member
of the epidermal growth factor TM7 family, possesses a
chimeric structure with a seven-span transmembrane
region most related to EMR3 and an EGF domain region
nearly identical to CD97. The chimeric structure of EMR2
has been continuously maintained since early mammalian radiation by gene conversion events between different regions of the EMR2 gene and the oppositely
orientated and physically adjacent genes CD97 and EMR3
[15].
We may postulate that the unusual conservation of
sequence identity for the region 436 to 746 of TLR1 and
TLR6, in all nine mammalian species for which complete
sequence information is available, reflects strong selective
mechanisms that restrained divergence of this region.
However, in view of the conserved gene conversion
boundaries, restriction of high sequence identity to the
region 436–746 allowed (or favored) independent evolution of the N-terminal region and extreme C-terminal
region of TLR1 and TLR6. Information on the function of
the various domains of TLR1 and TLR6 has become available in recent years and may support this postulate. Heterodimers of TLR1 or TLR6 with TLR2 mediate cell
activation in response to a large number of diacyl and triacyl ligands. Gene duplication of the ancestor of TLR1 and
TLR6 enabled divergence between the two receptors leading to an increase in the repertoire of lipopeptides that can
be recognized by TLR2 heterodimers. Transfection of
human embryonic kidney cells for expression of TLR1 or
TLR6, in combination with TLR2 and CD14, made cells
responsive to tri- and di-acylated lipopeptides, respectively [8]. Examination of chimeric receptors, generated
by domain exchange between TLR1 and TLR6 revealed
that LRR9-12 enables these receptors to discriminate
between tri- and di-acylated lipopeptides [9]. The greater
sequence identity of the TLR1 and TLR6 orthologs, and
lower sequence identity of the paralogs in these domains,
is in accordance with a preservation of lipopeptide discrimination potential during mammalian evolution.
The higher sequence identity of TLR1/6 paralogs for the
amino acid region 436 to 746, generated by gene conversion, might reflect the need for TLR1 and TLR6 to coevolve with common binding partners, in such a way that
functional interaction surfaces are maintained. Analysis
by fluorescence resonance energy transfer has shown that
TLR1/TLR2 and TLR6/TLR2 heterodimers are present at

the cell surface even in the absence of lipopeptide ligands
[8]. It is therefore likely that TLR1 or TLR6 have at least to
co-evolve with TLR2 to maintain a functional extracellular
dimer interaction site. The localization of the interaction
site may be inferred from the crystal structure of TLR3,
which revealed homodimer formation with the dimer
interface located in the C-terminal LRR motifs [16], a
region corresponding to the N-terminal end of the conserved TLR1/TLR6 paralog region we describe. To what
extent these dimer interfaces of TLR3 may be relevant for
TLR2-mediated signaling remains to be established,
because the formation of the TLR3 dimer structure might
be a transient or forced encounter and therefore of questionable biological significance (for a discussion see [17]).
The contrasting requirement for diversity of ligand binding sites located in LRR9-12 that need to respond to evolutionary pressure from pathogens and co-evolution of
dimer interaction sites in the C-terminal LRR motifs, is in
agreement with the location in LRR16 of the gene conversion start sites. Our finding that in all species gene conversion starts in an almost identical position (Table 1)
suggests that the LRR13-15 region is also important for
ligand recognition and discrimination. In this context it is
interesting to note that the dsRNA binding site in TLR3 is
located at amino acids H539 and N541 [18]. In an alignment with TLR1 and TLR6, these amino acids are located
immediately prior to the common start position for gene
conversion between TLR1 and TLR6.
Other putative extracellular binding partners with which
TLR1 and TLR6 might need to co-evolve are CD14 [8] and
CD36 [19]. These proteins are associated with the TLR1/
TLR2 and TLR6/TLR2 heterodimers when TLR ligands are
present [8]. CD14 and CD36 are able to bind triacylated
and diacylated lipopeptides and appear to serve as "sensors" or scavenger receptors to present the lipopeptides to
TLR2 heterodimers [19,20]. However, direct binding of
CD14 to TLR1 or TLR2 could not be detected [20].
Known or putative binding partners for the intracellular
TIR domains of TLR1 and TLR6 are the TIR domains of
TLR2, MyD88 and TIRAP [21,22]. The need to co-evolve
with these functional binding partners may explain the
extension of the preserved gene conversion sequence to
the intracellular region. Recently, specific information has
become available on the interactions between the TIR
domains of TLR1 or TLR6 and intracellular binding partners. Site-directed mutagenesis and computer-based docking studies of the TIR domains of TLR1 and TLR2 revealed
an interaction between Gly-676 (numbering according to
reference [23] and corresponding to position 685 [see

esting to note that at two other interaction sites orthologs
are almost identical to each other and different from their
paralogs. One of these interaction sites, which lies within
the region homogenized by gene conversion, corresponds
to His-646 in TLR1 [position 655 in Additional file 1]. The
backbone NH of His-646 of TLR1 is predicted to form an
intramolecular H-bond with the side chain of Asn-700,
maintaining their tertiary structure in the TLR1/2 complex
[23]. In addition, Asn-700 interacts with Asp-730 in TLR2
and an electrostatic interaction is predicted for side chains
of TLR1 His-646 and TLR2 Asp-730. Next to His-646, at
residue 645 [position 654 in Additional file 1], in eight
out of nine species analyzed, TLR1 has a glycine, whereas
all TLR6 sequences have glutamic acid. This suggests that
selective mechanisms have maintained (or re-established)
these distinct amino acids within the region of gene conversion. A third TLR1-TLR2 interaction site contains Tyr737 of TLR1 [position 746 in Additional file 1], which for
most mammals lies exactly at the 3' end of the region
homogenized by gene conversion. Here all 9 TLR1
sequences analyzed have a tyrosine, while all TLR6
sequences have an asparagine. The observation that, for
two out of three interaction sites, orthologous amino
acids are identical and different from their paralogs,
implies the existence of subtle structural differences
between the TIR domain heterodimers of TLR1 and TLR6
with TLR2 that were maintained despite gene conversion
events in their vicinity. To what extent this translates into
functional differences between TLR1 and TLR6 remains to
be established.
A common binding partner of TLR-TIR domains is
MyD88. Recent results suggest that the TLR2-TIR domain
can bind MyD88, whereas the TLR1-TIR and TLR6-TIR
domains do not [24]. However, mutation of one TLR1
amino acid from Asn-672 to Asp [position 681 in Additional file 1] enables TLR1 to bind MyD88, suggesting that
these two proteins have almost complementary surfaces.
It remains to be established whether, in the context of
lipopeptide-activated cells, MyD88 has the ability to bind
TLR1. A second important molecule for signaling through
TLR1/TLR2, TLR6/TLR2 or TLR4 is TIRAP, a sorting
adapter molecule which facilitates MyD88 recruitment to
the plasma membrane [25]. Presently, no information is
available on direct binding of TIRAP to TLR1 or TLR6.
Additional intracellular TLR binding proteins are heat
shock protein 60 and the RNA helicase DDX36 (DHX36),
which bind the TIR domain of TLR1, and heat shock protein 75, which binds TLR1 and TLR6 [24]. The interaction
sites between these proteins and TLR1 or TLR6 are not yet
determined. Taken together, the large number of common
binding partners places severe co-evolutionary constraints
on the TIR domains of TLR1 and TLR6, which may explain
the occurrence of gene conversion events in this region.
However, these constraints do not explain why the 3' ends

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:148

of the gene conversion region lies within 15 bp of each
other for 7 out of 9 analyzed mammalian species, and
why for the region downstream of this site the TLR1 or
TLR6 orthologs are again more similar to each other than
to their respective paralogs. From the crystal structure of
the TIR domain of TLR1 [26] we may conclude that the
corresponding amino acids (745-end) all lie in one plane
at the surface of the TIR domain (Figure 3). An intriguing
possibility would be that TLR1 and TLR6 each interact
with a different intracellular binding partner – either one
of those mentioned above or originated by duplication of
an ancestral binding partner of the TLR1/TLR6 ancestor –
which might mediate intracellular responses that are specific for TLR1 or TLR6. However, the existence of such
hypothetical intracellular TLR1- or TLR6-specific binding
partners remains to be established.
The C-terminal cap motif and the transmembrane
domain of TLR1 and TLR6 also show higher paralog than
ortholog sequence identity. This either implies a requirement for co-evolution with as yet unknown binding partners for these regions, or that the selective mechanisms
operating on LRR16-19 and the TIR domain stimulate
gene conversion events that drag the intervening C-terminal cap and transmembrane sequences along.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/148

TLR10 shares a common locus with TLR1 and TLR6. It is
an orphan receptor that can form homodimers and heterodimers with TLR1 and TLR2, has a TIR domain that is
functionally active and uses MyD88 as an adapter molecule [27]. Studies on the in vivo role of TLR10 are hampered by the fact that in mice TLR10 is a nonfunctional
pseudogene. We investigated whether gene conversion
had occurred between TLR10 and TLR1 or TLR6, but
found no evidence for gene conversion except for a very
small region in the genomes of Bos Taurus and Sus scrofa,
which is ancestral to the gene conversion events between
TLR1 and TLR6 in these species. The absence of consistent
gene conversion between TLR10 and TLR1 or TLR6 is
most likely due to the more recent divergence of TLR1 and
TLR6 from a common ancestor, as reflected by the phylogenetic trees and the higher sequence identity between
TLR1 and TLR6 (around 80%) as compared to that
between TLR10 and TLR1 or TLR6 (less than 50%). Furthermore, the common binding partners of TLR1 and
TLR6, which drive the coevolution of these proteins, may
not be the same as the binding partners of TLR10.

Conclusion
The results reported here show that the paralogous mammalian TLR1 and TLR6 genes have a conserved region of
extremely high sequence identity that has been maintained by gene conversion. This implies that gene conversion was a common and useful evolutionary mechanism
for these TLRs. Our findings show that protein paralogs
with multiple functional domains can maintain common
characteristics for specific domains by gene conversion,
while allowing other domains to evolve diversified functions. Given the large number of paralogs that are present
in a mammalian genome, and the common occurrence of
multiprotein complexes, it is to be expected that similar
examples of gene conversion will be discovered. By recognizing sequences maintained by gene conversion, through
careful phylogenetic analysis of these genomes in several
mammalian species, it may be possible to identify novel
protein-protein interaction sites and functionally important protein sub-structures.

Three-dimensional model of the TIR domain of
human TLR1. In red: amino acids 746 to 795 [numbering
according to Additional file 1]. Note that the amino acids all
lie in one plane at the surface of the TIR domain.

The analysis is based on gene sequences coding for TLR1
and TLR6 from nine different mammalian species: Homo
sapiens, Pan troglodytes, Macaca mulatta (representing the
order Primates); Mus musculus and Rattus norvegicus (representing the order Rodentia); Erinaceus europaeus (representing the order Insectivora), Bos taurus and Sus scrofa
(representing two families of the order Artiodactyla) and
Canis familiaris (representing the order Carnivora). TLR10
sequences were from the same species except Mus Musculus that has a TLR10 pseudogene and Erinaceus europaeus
for which no TLR10 sequence is available. All sequences
were obtained from the Ensembl genome browser (release

44)[28], except the Sus scrofa sequences which were
obtained as cDNA sequences from the NCBI nucleotide
server [29]. For all TLR1, TLR6 and TLR10 genes the entire
open reading frame is coded on a single exon. Also, we
found no evidence for retroelements in the TLR1 and
TLR6 genes. The numbering of the LRRs in TLR1 and TLR6
is according to Bell et al. [4] and is specified [see Additional file 1]. The DNA sequences used for the analyses are
given [see Additional file 4].
Note added in proof.
The crystal structure of the TLR1-TLR2 heterodimer bound
to a tri-acylated lipopeptide has been determined [35].
The interface between TLR1 and TLR2 was found to be
located between LRR11 and LRR14.

Multiple alignment of protein and DNA sequences and
calculations of percentage identities were made using
ClustalW software [30] and phylogenetic trees of full
length molecules, or segments thereof, created by the Difference of Sums of Squares method using Topali software
[31] with default parameters and a bootstrap value of
1000. Codon usage for conserved amino acids was analyzed manually. Statistical analyses for differences in
sequence identity of full length TLRs, or segments thereof,
as well as of codon usage for conserved amino acids was
analyzed by the non-parametric Wilcoxon two sample
test. Detection of most likely borders of gene conversion
events and statistics were done using Geneconv software
[12]. The crystal structure of the TIR domain of TLR1 was
determined by Xu et al. [26] and obtained from the protein databank with access number 1fyv [32]. The structure
was visualized using the Swiss-PdbViewer program [33].
