Abstract
Background: the use of specific but partially degenerate primers for nucleic acid hybridisations
and PCRs amplification of known or unknown gene families was first reported well over a decade
ago and the technique has been used widely since then.
Results: here we report a novel and successful selection strategy for the design of hybrid partially
degenerate primers for use with RT-PCR and RACE-PCR for the identification of unknown gene
families. The technique (named PaBaLiS) has proven very effective as it allowed us to identify and
clone a large group of mRNAs encoding neurotoxin-like polypeptide pools from the venom of
Agelena orientalis species of spider. Our approach differs radically from the generally accepted
CODEHOP principle first reported in 1998. Most importantly, our method has proven very
efficient by performing better than an independently generated high throughput EST cloning
programme. Our method yielded nearly 130 non-identical sequences from Agelena orientalis, whilst
the EST cloning technique yielded only 48 non-identical sequences from 2100 clones obtained from
the same Agelena material. In addition to the primer design approach reported here, which is almost
universally applicable to any PCR cloning application, our results also indicate that venom of Agelena
orientalis spider contains a much larger family of related toxin-like sequences than previously
thought.
Conclusion: with upwards of 100,000 species of spider thought to exist, and a propensity for
producing diverse peptide pools, many more peptides of pharmacological importance await
discovery. We envisage that some of these peptides and their recombinant derivatives will provide
a new range of tools for neuroscience research and could also facilitate the development of a new
generation of analgesic drugs and insecticides.

Background
Toxins and toxin-like molecules are present and used
widely throughout the animal kingdom. Among the
arthropods, which constitute over 90% of the animal
kingdom and include bees, wasps, ants, spiders, scorpions
and many other various taxa, many are well known for
their predacity and toxic venoms. These have evolved to
yield complex and highly specialised toxins which are
now successfully used by these predaceous animals to
either protect themselves or attack their prey. Despite
being considered the most successful animals on Earth
(over one million species known and up to 6–9 million
species predicted to exist in total) and the massive
research effort so far, only a tiny proportion of arthropods
has been studied in detail. Spiders evolved from an arachnid ancestor around 400 million years ago and currently
comprise over 100,000 different species. Spiders are the
most successful predatory animals, in evolutionary terms,
and they maintain by far the largest pool of toxic peptides.
There are over 39,000 catalogued species [1], with an even
larger number still awaiting characterisation [2]. It has
been calculated, based upon a conservative estimate of
some 80,000 species and approximately 50 peptides per
species [3], that there are in the region of 4 million distinct
spider-venom polypeptides in existence [4] although of
these only a few venoms have been characterised. Only a
few hundred of known toxins or toxin-like genes have so
far been reported (worldwide) from arthropods or other
venomous creatures such as snails or snakes. The precise
composition of spider venoms varies significantly
between different species. Spider toxins are thought to
have derived from a small number of gene super-families
with many peptide toxins sharing structural features, conserved amino acids and consensus sequences. This allows
them to interact with specific targets such as related classes
of cellular receptors. The wide array of peptides may be
associated with spiders being general predators, i.e. they
do not focus on one specific prey species. It has been suggested that the generation of peptide toxin diversity in spiders has probably been achieved via a similar process to
that of cone snails (a group of predatory marine snails
which produce an array of neurotoxic peptides collectively
named conotoxins), i.e. via extensive gene duplication
followed by key hyper-mutations of the pro-peptide and
mature-toxin segments. The resultant pool of genes has
subsequently been subjected to the pressures of adaptive
evolution and this has culminated in the vast arrays of
species-specific combinatorial peptide libraries which
now exist [4]. It is by the very nature of these processes
that an opportunity to discover new peptides of pharmacological importance has become possible using techniques such as PCR-based cloning incorporating
degenerate primers, and EST-based cloning.

One of the few successful "molecular" approaches to
molecular cloning of polypeptide toxins was reported
recently by Kozlov et al. [5,6]. There an EST (expressed
sequence tag) high throughput cloning strategy was
employed which yielded nearly 50 novel toxin and toxinlike sequences from Agelena orientalis following the
sequencing of 2166 individual EST clones [6]. There are
two main advantages to using the EST based approach: the
discovery of novel genes and their mRNAs/cDNAs does
not require any prior knowledge of the nucleic acid or
amino acid sequence information (open system) and if
applied to non-normalised cDNA libraries (or pools) it
often yields quantitative information on the individual
transcripts abundance. This allows, at least in principle,
the discovery and expression profiling of all genes
expressed in the cell/tissue/etc. without any pre-selection.
This useful property is widely relied upon in pharmacogenomics, drug discovery, biomedical and plant sciences
(for reviews see [7-13]). For the same reasons, and unless
an EST cloning approach is used to explore fully normalised cDNA libraries, the outcome will be biased towards
the highly abundant transcripts whilst lower abundance
molecular species will likely escape detection. Not surprisingly, EST sequencing of Agelena orientalis revealed that
over 70% of all of the EST clones sequences (1497 out of
2166) encoded the same transcript Agelenin (see [6]),
whilst most of the other newly identified genes (47 altogether) were represented by just a few or in most cases by
a single EST [6]. EST based cloning is a generic and universal approach to the discovery and expression profiling of
genes, but despite its wide applicability it has a few drawbacks, such as the above discussed bias towards highly
abundant transcripts and the requirements for lab automation, which are not universally available. This chapter
aims to illustrate an alternative approach to the discovery
of novel families of toxin or toxin-like polypeptides.
PCR amplification [14,15] has revolutionised life sciences
[16,17] and with all its numerous variations has become
one of the most widely used techniques in molecular biology. PCR has been described elsewhere; see e.g. [18] and
references therein. The main PCR variations, related to
cDNA amplification and cloning include PCR/RT-PCR,
RACE-PCR [19-21] and the related RLM-RACE-PCR [22];
LS-SSP-PCR [23], AP-PCR/DD-PCR [24,25] and AFLP
[26], see Figure 1(these do not include PCR with nested
primers [27], of which the principle can be applied to any
of the above or their combinations). The former three
PCR processes have one important feature in common –
they all require the knowledge of the exact sequence on
which the oligonucleotide primer(s) are based. The use of
the PCR/RT-PCR, RACE-PCR and to a lesser degree LSSSP-PCR, results in the amplification of one or a few target-specific sequences situated between the two primer
annealing sites (PCR, RT-PCR), between the primer

annealing site and 5'- or 3'- ends (RACE-PCR), or between
the specific primer annealing site and a few non specific
annealing sites on the same DNA as in LS-SSP-PCR.
Unlike these, AP-PCR/DD-PCR and AFLP do not require
any knowledge of the target sequence (are open systems).
However, these methods typically result in the amplification of a much larger number of DNA fragments and are
generally most useful for various DNA fingerprinting
applications. Block arrows (Figure 1, top and bottom)
summarise the above PCR strategies by indicating the
overall trends in primer sequence specificity vs. sequence
degeneracy and vs. a typical number of amplified products.
The use of specific but partially degenerate or hybrid primers for nucleic acid hybridisations and PCRs amplification
of known or unknown gene families was first reported
well over a decade ago (see e.g. [28] for the use of degenerate primers in hybridisations and [29,30] for PCR applications) and further mastered by Rose et al. (see [31,32]
and references therein). The technique has been used
widely since then. Introducing degeneracy into the primer
sequence aims to compensate for codon degeneracy (if
only the amino acid sequence is known) or amino acid
degeneracy (if the aim is to amplify a family of DNAs
encoding proteins having multiple amino acids at a position in the alignment). The most common problems of
degenerate primer design include:
i. too high a degeneracy leading to elevated non-specific
amplification (due to an abundance of irrelevant
sequences) and absence of specific amplification (due to
low relative concentration of the correct primer sequence
and early depletion of that pool)
ii. too high a degeneracy leading to the formation of secondary structures and self-annealing, detrimental to a
PCR amplification
iii. high variability in the Tm within the pool of degenerate primers, making it impossible to choose optimal
annealing temperatures
iv. a further potential problem of the approach is the inability to define suitable regions of high sequence conservation and thus an inability to design any primers at all,
e.g when the sequences analysed are too dissimilar and/or
when a large number of sequences are being aligned
(often resulting in no homologous regions altogether).
Both primer design [31-33] and the choice of conserved
sequence fragments are key issues for the success of any
such amplification. Although easy in principle, practical
applications of degenerate primers are often limited to the
amplification of gene/protein families having a high

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/32

degree of sequence similarity and containing low degeneracy codons in the positions corresponding to the PCR
primers. Successful application of degenerate or hybrid
primers also depend on the particular application, target
abundance and target sequence(s) variation. A PCR/RTPCR employing partially degenerate primers occupies a
place somewhat in-between the other PCR approaches
mentioned above, see (Figure 1) and its applications
range from the use of low degeneracy "best guess" primers
(allowing typically for a more specific annealing and
amplification) to hybrid or even fully degenerate primers
which have a tendency to amplify more fragments, which
are often more non-specific fragments, and to a lower
degree. The range of PCRs with degenerate primers is schematically indicated on Figure 1 with grey arrows.

Results and discussion
Multiple alignment of a large number of existing toxin and
toxin-like sequences yields no universal consensus
sequence
The starting point of this investigation was the realisation
that the number of known toxin and toxin-like peptides
(from arthropods and alike) was in excess of a hundred
(based on a PubMed search at the beginning of this work).
It was also not unreasonable to assume that the target species Agelena orientalis could have contained more than just
a few novel related toxin-like sequences. Our approach to
the problem of cloning a potentially large peptide family
of toxin-like peptides consisted of a number of logical
steps, key enabling assumptions and technical solutions
which eventually led to the identification of over 100 distinct cDNAs, and which can be applied to any similar
problem of identifying large families of expressed peptides or proteins. The first step was to align the existing
toxin and toxin-like sequences (over 150 sequences were
aligned in total). This was in order to find regions with
high sequence homology or conservation. Unfortunately
this resulted in that no single universal consensus sequence
was identified. This was not unexpected and was also in
agreement with the reports on cone snails by Duda &
Palumbi (in which the repertoire of mature toxin
sequences contained non-conservative substitutions in
nearly all positions except for the cysteine residues [34])
and, more recently, on arthropods by Kozlov et al. (where
the alignment of ca. 300 arthropod toxin sequences
yielded no conservative regions [6] and hence no easy
chance to design a universal consensus primer). However
a number of short consensus regions were indeed identified between small subsets (ca 2–5 individual sequences on
average, see e.g. Figure 2). Identical or highly similar
sequence fragments found in at least 3 different protein
toxins were considered for further analysis.

The design of hybrid partially degenerate primers
Short subsets of toxin and toxin-like sequences, regardless
of their origin (i.e. species), sequence/structure (i.e. short/
long, cysteine pattern, presence of any secondary structure
elements) or function (i.e. functional toxin or simply
toxin-like sequence), were considered but only if they
resulted in any alignment suitable for primer design.
Although sequence similarities between the small number
of highly related sequences are not likely to identify real
consensus sequences the use of these was often the only
possibility. However, trying hundreds of such fragments
would be impractical. Therefore only those were chosen
which satisfy the criteria listed below.

The original communication by Rose et al. [31] reported
one of the first successful uses of hybrid partially degenerate primers for PCR detection of diverse reverse transcriptase-like genes from a human genome, and of
detection of C5 DNA methyltransferase homologs from
plant DNAs. Contrary to the report of Rose et al., in which
the regions of sequence homology and lowest degeneracy
were at the 3' end and the highest degeneracy was at the 5'
end, we have chosen to minimise or avoid completely any
degeneracy at the 5' end of the oligonucleotide primers. Figure 3 depicts the fundamentally different design principles between the CODEHOP approach [31] (Figure 3A)
and our approach (Figure 3B), which was named PaBaLiS
(after the authors' names) for brevity and in order to
maintain a commonly followed tradition of meaningful
naming. In the design by Rose et al. [31], the annealing of
the sequence-specific non-degenerate consensus clamp at
the 5' end to the template DNA strand does not guarantee
that the correct 3' sequence is present in this primer.
Therefore such 3' ends would compete with the correct 3'
sequences and the efficiency of amplification will be
reduced proportionally to the primer degeneracy. If highly
degenerate primers are used (i.e. correct 3' end is present
at low concentration compared to the arbitrary/wrong 3'
end components), amplification will seize. Therefore 3'
ends of PCR primers should ideally be non-degenerate to
increase the specificity of amplification and efficiency of
amplification, minimise non-specific priming, avoid
forming primer dimers and provide a means to utilise
even mismatched primers for amplification. As the PCR
amplification progresses and the 100% matching primers
are used-up, partially mismatching ones would become
capable of priming PCR amplification at the later amplification steps, even having a few mismatches at the 5' end,
but not at 3' end (as in CODEHOP approach). We have
therefore limited our search to such homologous regions
(of protein sequences) which could be used in the design
of 3' low degeneracy primers (i.e. having low amino acid
and codon degeneracy at their 3' end).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/32

The next criterion was to allow the highest degeneracy in
the middle of PCR primers (this was to guarantee 100 %
sequence matching and hence the maximum hybrid stability). Furthermore, the 5' end of the oligonucleotide
primers was often designed to have a "best guess"
sequence (based on both amino acid degeneracy at the
position and the codon usage frequencies). This often significantly reduced the overall sequence degeneracy, at a
small price of possibly introducing mismatches at the very
5' end (these would not destabilise the hybrid compared
to any mismatches in the middle of the primer). Figure 3C
shows the very different distribution of degenerate bases
for the 22 oligonucleotides of identical length (20-mers)
out of the 44 oligonucleotides designed in this study. The
maximum degeneracy is reached in the middle of the
primer unlike the CODEHOP primers (Figure 3A).
The overall primer length was kept to an average of 20
bases (17–23 bases range) and the overall degeneracy – to
below approx ~64. The latter is because higher degeneracy
means a lower concentration of any single primer and
their quick depletion from the pool of available primers as
PCR amplification proceeds. Although the unique primer
design allows us to utilise some partially matching primers to boost the effective concentration of the working
primer, a degeneracy over ~100 was found to be detrimental in our previous experience. Therefore, in the regions
where designed primers did not satisfy the degeneracy criteria, Inosine was substituted at the most highly degenerate positions between 5' end and approximately the
middle of the oligonucleotide sequence. Figure 3D shows
the actual distribution of Inosine residues for the 22 oligonucleotides of identical length (20-mers) out of the 44
oligonucleotides designed in this study. Figure 2 gives an
easy to follow example of the primer design. Table 1 lists
all the sequence specific primers designed, to allow the
reader to appreciate the range of primer design outcomes.
We can summarise the key advantages of PaBaliS over
CODEHOP as follows:
i. highest specificity of annealing and amplification due to
low (or absence) of degeneracy at 3' end,
ii. less stringent requirements for the length and composition of the protein consensus sequence, which in PaBaLiS is at the 3' end and is generally shorter than the
equivalent "non-degenerate consensus clamp" 5' region
in CODEHOP.
iii. PaBaLiS design allows avoidance of dimer formation
(through non-specific annealing) since 3' ends are unique
non-degenerate sequences and can be easily designed not
to dimerise: in contrast to CODEHOP, where all primers
will find their complementary 3' pair and will tend to

Figure 3
The comparison of CODEHOP and PaBaLiS primers
The comparison of CODEHOP and PaBaLiS primers. (A) Schematic representation of the CODEHOP primer, based
on the original design by Rose et al. [31]. The maximum degeneracy is aimed at the 3' region, which reduces the amplification
efficiency (due to competition by "wrong" 3' end sequences for annealing, these will disallow amplification) and very high probability of dimer formation by such oligos (e.g. fully degenerate 3-4-5 or 6-mers will all able to dimerise). (B) Schematic representation of the PaBaLiS primer design. Note that maximum degeneracy is achieved in the middle of the primer, minimising the
number of possible mismatches in the middle of the primer and increasing the stability of the hybrid (primer/cDNA). Low
degeneracy (and high sequence conservation) at the 3' end ensured the highest specificity of annealing, amplification and allows
to easily avoid primer dimers. (C) The actual distribution of degenerate bases for PaBaLiS primers designed in this study. The
choice of oligonucleotides for this analysis includes the 22 oligonucleotides of identical length (20-mer long oligonucleotides,
based on 7 amino acid long stretches of partially of fully homologous protein sequences) of the 44 oligonucleotides designed in
total. The horizontal axis indicated the nucleotide degeneracy in triplets approximately corresponding to each of the 7 amino
acid positions used to generate these 20-mer oligonucleotides. The mean degeneracy calculated as total degeneracy at this
position (due to both the amino acid and the genetic code degeneracy) divided by the number of oligonucleotides). The numbers of the bars indicate actual values. Note that decreased overall degeneracy at 5' end is due to the use of "best guess" based
and triplets, but not because amino acid degeneracy was lower at this position. (D) The actual distribution of inosine substitutions in the same PaBaLiS primers as in (C). The use of inosines allowed to decrease overall degeneracy without introducing
mismatches in the middle of the primers,

Non standard and degenerate nucleotide positions are defined as
follows: R = A+G, Y = C+T, N = A+C+G+T, M = A+C, W = A+T, D
= G+A+T, I = Inosine, K = G+T, H = A+T+C, S = G+C, B = G+T+C,
V = A+C+G

dimerise (leading to quick depletion of the primer pool,
non specific priming and poor amplification).
iv. PaBaLiS primers have lower degeneracy overall, and
even primers with a few mismatching positions will be
able to anneal specifically and continue amplification at
later stages of the amplification, when the 100% matching
primers are exhausted

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/32

v. PaBaLiS primer design yields a larger fraction of primers
with no mismatches at the 3' end (meaning that all primers have specific 3' ends, which is most important for the
specificity and efficiency of amplification).
vi. PaBaLiS primers have fewer mismatches in the middle
of the primer (since degeneracy is allowed) and therefore
higher overall hybrid forming stability (unlike CODEHOP where mismatches are possible in the middle of the
primer, thus destabilising the hybrids).
The limitations of the CODEHOP approach were highlighted in a recent report by Gray and Coates [35] where
the authors had to use two completely nested sets of
CODEHOP RT-PCR primers to amplify a highly-conserved 168 amino acid long region (only to design RACE
primers for the next amplification round), whilst PaBaLiS
primers apparently work directly for RACE-PCR and can
be designed to amplify sequences with just a few amino
acids homology, and which do not need to be between
consecutive amino acids (small gaps allowed).
Annealing temperature matching
The constraints described above reduced the number of
suitable regions significantly in our case and would
undoubtedly do so in any other similar cloning approach.
One other important criterion of the primer design is in a
reduction of the range of annealing temperatures for
highly degenerate primers and matching these for the
pairs of PCR primers. We soon realised that no suitable 5'
and 3' PCR primer pairs (especially with the matching
annealing temperatures) could be obtained. Therefore the
decision was to opt for RACE-PCR. This is likely to be the
only available option in any similar cloning project, when
not enough sequence information is available for the
design of more than one sequence-specific primer (not a
primer pair with matching annealing temperatures). The
nature of the RACE-PCR technique is in the use of one
universal primer instead of one sequence specific primer.
This eliminates the need for the second sequence-specific
primer, but leads to a faster accumulation of the products
of non-specific amplification and the faster depletion of
the universal primer (the latter might require the use of
higher concentrations of the universal primer, and has to
be determined experimentally in each particular case).
The major advantage of using RACE-PCR in addition to
the requirement of the single sequence specific primer) is
that the annealing temperatures can be more easily
matched by redesigning the universal RACE primers (e.g.
modifying their length). Table 1 lists such subsets of universal primers suitable for the RACE-PCR (both Oligo-dT
and "URA" primer subsets were used successfully though
we prefer the Oligo-dT primers over the "URA" adapter
primers, also designed in the course of this work). The
designed Oligo-dT primers had predicted Tm's of 68.8°C,

Page 8 of 15

BMC Molecular Biology 2007, 8:32

57.1°C and 50.1°C (calculated using on-line software
from Sigma-Genosys, Cambridge, United Kingdom). The
nearest Tm matched primer was used as the RACE primer
for each different degenerate primer to ensure the best
performance of RACE-PCR (thus the difference in the
annealing temperatures was always kept low). Finally, as
a last step of primer design all primer pairs (all universal
"URA" primers vs. each individual hybrid partially degenerate primers) were checked for any possible dimer formation. Two nucleotides long overlap at the primers' 3' end
was not considered as leading to dimer formation, but
three and higher overlaps were disallowed. The primer
design is therefore a careful balance between the need to
allow for all known (and potentially unknown) degenerate positions and the requirement of limited degeneracy,
matched annealing temperatures, absence of secondary
structures, no self annealing, no primer dimers and the
ease of subsequent cloning. Table 1 lists all the primers
designed in our investigation and might serve an example
of successful primer design for a similar experiment.
Optimisation of the amplification conditions
The guide on choosing the PCR conditions and various
key optimisation procedures can be found elsewhere
[18,36-39]. Below we describe key amplification conditions used in our investigation and depict additional optimisation steps, easily applicable to any similar cloning
problem. Because of the degeneracy, the primer mixtures
have a wide range of Tm values. Since the correct matching sequence is unknown (otherwise no degeneracy
would be needed) it is impossible to predict the annealing
temperature theoretically. It can only be determined
experimentally. Therefore each individual partially degenerate primer was probed at a range of temperatures (using
Mastercycler gradient (96-wells) PCR machine from
Eppendorf) and, where necessary, with different RACEPCR universal (oligo-dT) primers having matching temperatures (Table 1). Only those primers which showed
any amplification and the corresponding optimal temperature cycling conditions were used in later investigations.
The optimisation of the annealing temperature (see Figure
4A for the example) has shown that temperature differences as low as 2°C could have dramatic effects on the
RACE-PCR outcome for some of the degenerate primers
(much more so than would such a temperature difference
affect a standard PCR). We have also routinely changed
the annealing temperature through the PCR amplification.
The annealing step temperature was always gradually
decreased at a rate of 0.1–0.2°C per cycle as the amplification progressed, in order to reduce the stringency of
annealing and allow primers with mismatches to anneal
and to continue the amplification. This has allowed us to
maintain the high exponential rate of amplification of the
correct fragments. Despite the decrease in the concentration of the matching primers towards the end of the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/32

amplification, the proportion of the correct amplified
sequences increases and thus the probability and the
kinetics rate of annealing the mismatched primers also
increases, resulting in a stronger amplification albeit with
a few mismatched bases very near the fragment ends
(within primer sequences). Our temperature ramp (during the annealing steps) is different from what is commonly known as "touch down" or "step down"
approaches, which aim to minimise the need to optimise
annealing temperature or buffer conditions and circumvent spurious priming during gene amplification [37,39].
In the "touch down" or "step down" applications PCR
priming is normally initiated above the optimum annealing temperature for the specific primer to promote a
greater discrimination between the annealing/amplification for the most stringently annealed primer/template pair
(versus same primers annealed non-specifically to
another place on the DNA template). Such an approach
would be detrimental if highly degenerate primers are
used (as in the described study) due to the artificially
strong advantage that would be given to the primers with
higher annealing temperatures, which are not necessarily
the primers having correct sequences. In our approach we
already start with the temperature finely optimised
(within just a few degrees) to achieve higher (or any) yield
for the PCR product of expected size (where possible). The
very small decrease in the annealing temperature in our
protocol is to allow the mismatched oligonucleotides to
continue to prime PCR amplification at later amplification stages.
High throughout amplification and cloning
Of the 44 primers that passed our selection criteria
described above, 40 have been shown to produce products (i.e. resulted in cDNA amplification). Altogether over
60 distinct cDNAs (or groups of cDNAs of similar lengths)
were identified from Agelena orientalis total RNA by low
stringency 3'-RACE-PCR (since many sets of primers have
yielded more than one group of cDNA fragments, by their
length). Figure 4B gives just a few examples of the first
round of RACE amplifications. Large numbers of amplified fragments meant that we had to streamline the cloning and positive clone selection procedures. Identification
of positive clones was carried out by PCR directly from
colonies. The primers (PBS-F and PGM-2R) were designed
based on the vector sequence (Table 1). The clones were
picked using sterile tips and transferred onto a fresh new
antibiotic plate first, then using the same tip directly dissolved in the mixtures of PCR reactions. The positive
clones and sizes were identified by agarose gel electrophoresis. This was a much quicker and more informative
method for screening positive clones than applying an
IPTG (blue/white) selection procedure [40]. This had the
additional advantage of allowing positive clones to be
identified within approximately one day and the sizes of

amplification at three different annealing temperatures, roughly chosen as Tm-7°C, Tm-5°C and Tm-3°C (based on Tm values
calculated using on-line primer design software from Sigma-Genosys). Hybrid primer M22F (panel A, left gel) does not show
any preference for annealing temperature. Primer M15F (panel A, middle) shows strong preference for Tm-7°C. Primer 06F
(panel A, right panel) exemplifies an apparent preference for Tm-5°C. Note, although all the above amplifications were performed simultaneously under identical conditions and using gradient PCR machine, no quantitative estimate of the amplification
efficiencies can be made. However, relative differences due to the change of the annealing temperature could and have been
detected. (B) A gel electrophoresis exemlifying RACE-PCR amplification of Agelena orientalis cDNA using hybrid primers (left

optimised for each hybrid primer, as described above (panel A) and the oligo-dT primer with the matching Tm (see Table 1).

cloned inserts to be simultaneously determined. This
allowed us to improve the 'hit' rate with over 50% of
clones chosen for further analysis being independent
sequences. Traditional approaches relying on plasmid
purification and restriction mapping were not suitable for
our high-throughput cloning approach, since it was possible that the chosen restriction enzymes might cut within
the unknown insert sequences. Figure 4C illustrates some
of the positive clones with different insert sizes that were
identified by PCR reactions directly form bacterial colonies.
Sequences identification and analysis
A total of 226 positive clones with different size inserts
were obtained using the RACE-PCR approach described
above and confirmed by PCR as positive (i.e. having
insert). 130 of these were chosen from different groups of
amplified cDNA fragments (preferably having different
sizes, see Figure 4C) and were sequenced. Insert sequences
generated in this study, plus Agelena clones from Kozlov's
investigation identified using EST based cloning approach
[6], were compared directly against the Genbank database
(blastn). It was discovered that there were no significant
sequence similarities between Agelena orientalis sequences
(ours and from Kozlov et al. [6]) and published Genbank
entries. This was not unexpected since Agelena orientalis
venom has not previously been studied at the mRNA
level. But this has also proved the power of our cloning
approach. Out of the 130 non-identical sequences generated by RACE-PCR, 50 sequences matched the sequences
form the EST collection reported independently by Kozlov
et al. [6] with 100% sequence identity. The remaining 80
clones did not fully match reported sequences (sequence
identity ranging between 93% and 99% in most cases,
with a few sequences nearly having no identifiable
sequence similarity to the EST clones) and are likely to
represent additional toxins or toxin-like sequences. We
believe that this validated our approach to cloning and
demonstrated an advantage of using a RACE-PCR
approach in that it has proven extremely effective for discovering novel sequences and compares very favourably
with the EST based approach (in which only 48 novel
sequences were identified from over 2100 raw EST
sequences) [6]. The phylogenetic tree obtained following
multiple alignment of all of the novel sequences (including the 48 novel cDNA reported by Kozlov et al. [6] is
shown in Figure 5. This illustrates the extent of the
sequence similarities between different Agelena sequences.
Most of the sequences are rather alike with an average of
90% sequence similarity, whilst some sequences show
larger differences, such as I_19F#4, II_19F#2, II_19F#5,
II_19F#15, 29F#15, 29F#16, M13F#1, M13F#2, M13F#4,

M11F#16 (see Figure 5). These possess only short regions
of high sequence homology, with the rest of the sequences
having no clearly identifiable similarities. Some clones
(e.g. 32F#7, M25F#12, M09F#18) might represent novel
splice variants of previously reported sequences. Additional material available on-line [see Additional file 1]
contains all the sequences reported in Figure 5 and summarises the relationships of our sequences with the previously reported Agelena sequences.

Conclusion
The RACE RT-PCR strategy is a useful technique for amplifying specific regions of mRNA between a defined and
known internal site sequence and an unknown sequence
located at either the 3' or 5' end. When RACE-RT PCR is
combined with the application of degenerate primers the
method becomes a very effective way to clone and identify
novel cDNA fragments. Previously, such an approach has
been used successfully to clone and sequence cDNAs
encoding insecticidal peptides from primitive hunting
spiders [41]. The application of PCR-based cloning
directly complements an EST-based approach [42]. However, PCR-based cloning proffers a distinct advantage
whereby even rare transcripts can be identified, i.e. lowabundance transcripts are similarly well represented following amplification and are not lost in preference to
higher abundance molecules. This contrasts with EST
cloning which can often result in multiple copies of the
same abundant mRNA/cDNAs being cloned, unless normalised libraries are exploited [43]. Another important
issue is the proportional representation of individual
sequences at the outcome of the experiment. EST based
strategies (unless used with normalised libraries) preserve
the information on relative abundance of respective
cDNAs, whilst a PCR based approach might not, unless it
is a truly quantitative qRT-PCR, see e.g. [44]. The latter is
especially valid if no truly universal oligonucleotide primers (capable of simultaneously amplifying the whole family of mRNAs/cDNAs under investigation) are used. The
case presented here is a good example of such an
approach. We have not preserved any quantitative information on toxin mRNA/cDNA expression, but compared
to the EST approach reported in [6] we were able to identify more than twofold the number of different sequences
from the same material. Our oligonucleotide selection
algorithm is therefore superior if the discovery of new
genes is sought, but should not be used if quantitative
analysis of mRNA/cDNA expression is required.
As interest in the field of neuro-modulatory molecules
continues to expand, our approach contributes significantly through the provision of an effective high-throughput methodology to identify novel neurotoxin-like
peptide sequences from the venom of Agelena orientalis
species of spiders. The collective use of published neuro-

toxin sequence information, sets of specifically designed
partially degenerate hybrid primers and streamlined cloning and positive clone selection procedures have enabled
us to identify a large set (~130) of toxin-like sequences
from Agelena orientalis. This is an invaluable resource
although in all probably it represents only a very small
fraction of the overall number of functional spider toxin
peptides that are still awaiting discovery. The sequences
identified with RACE-PCR include 80 putative novel
toxin-like sequences, in addition to the ones matching the
sequences obtained independently by an EST-based
approach [6]. These sequences are indicative of the vast
repertoire and/or diversity of toxins, or toxin-like proteins, present in Agelena orientalis venom. These spider
venom toxins are a rich biological resource of active components and this presents an opportunity to develop further biological tools for neuroscience, in drug target
discovery and possibly as effective bio-pesticides. With
upwards of 100,000 species of spider thought to exist, and
each showing a propensity for producing diverse peptide
pools, many more neurotoxin peptides await discovery. It
is likely that a high percentage of these could be exploited
in a wide range of novel applications, and profit both
research and commercial industries.

Methods
The method development and optimisation procedures
are described earlier in this paper. Other methods are as
follows: the Aurum total RNA mini kit from BIO-RAD was
used for total RNA purification. The spider RNA was purified according to manufacturer's recommendations using
Spider glands (kindly provided by E.V.Grishin, Shemyakin- and Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow). cDNAs were
synthesised by using RevertAid™ M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase and "OLIGO-dT-21" or "URA_L" DNA primers
(see Table 1) according to manufacturer recommendations. cDNA was synthesised for 30 min at 42°C, followed
by 30 min at 50°C. The reaction was stopped by heating
the mixture at 70°C for 10 minutes and chilling on ice.
cDNA was aliquoted and stored frozen at -20°C (cDNA
was further diluted ×50 fold before use in PCR). RACEPCR conditions were outlined above. Briefly, an incubation at 95°C for 2 min (hot start) was followed by 15–30
cycles (typically 25 cycles) of 95°C for 1 min, Topt (the
optimised annealing temperature) for 1 min (and 0.1 –
0.2 °C drop per cycle), 72°C for 1 min; The reaction was
then kept at 72°C for 5 min and then held at 4°C. Red Taq
polymerase (Bioline) or Pfx (Invitrogen) were used. To
improve reproducibility of the PCR amplifications, all reagents except the sequence-specific primers (but including
polymerase) were mixed to make a master solution and
transferred into individual PCR tubes on ice. Then the
sequence-specific primers were added (also on ice) and
the tubes were transferred into a preheated PCR block.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/32

"HGAP-F62" and "HGAP-R62" GAPDH primers (Table 1)
were used to amplify mouse cDNA in optimisation experiments, mouse cDNA amplification was also used as a
positive control throughout. All oligonucleotide primers
were custom-made at SIGMA-Genosys (Cambridge,
United Kingdom). Competent cells (E.coli strain cMAX5α,
BIO-RAD) for chemical transformation were prepared as
follows. 100ul cells (from -20°C stock) were added into 5
ml LB media and cultured overnight at 37°C. 10ul cells
from the overnight culture were added to 5 ml LB containing 20 mM Mg2+ media and grown at 28°C until
OD550~0.5. Cells were then transferred into 50 ml Falcon
tubes, chilled on ice for 15 minutes and centrifuged at
1000 g for 15 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 17
ml of the FSB buffer (1/3 of the original culture volume)
and kept on ice for 15 minutes. The centrifugation step
was repeated once, after which the cells were resuspended
in 4 ml FSB buffer (to 1/12.5 of the original culture volume). 140 ul DMSO was added to the cell suspension
(3.5% final concentration) and kept on ice for 5 minutes.
Another aliquot of 140ul DMSO was added (to make 7%
final DMSO concentration) and the cells were kept on ice
for a further 15 minutes before being aliquoted into
chilled tubes and flash frozen in dry ice. Transformation
efficiency of the competent cells was ca. 108 transformants/μg DNA (heat shock was at 42°C/40 seconds). The
use of cells with high transformation efficiency has proven
highly beneficial especially when cloning low abundance
PCR products. The T-Easy Vector (Promega) was used to
clone Taq amplified sequences (both with and without
PCR product purification) and according to the manufacturer recommended procedure (ligation was at 25°C/1
hour). Plasmid purification was using Promega Miniprep
