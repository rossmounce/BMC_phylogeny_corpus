Abstract
A bioinformatic search was carried for plant homologues of human serine-threonine protein kinases
involved in regulation of cell division and microtubule protein phosphorylation (SLK, PAK6, PAK7,
MARK1, MAST2, TTBK1, TTBK2, AURKA, PLK1, PLK4 and PASK). A number of SLK, MAST2 and
AURKA plant homologues were identified. The closest identified homologue of human AURKA
kinase was a protein of unknown function, A7PY12/GSVIVT00026259001 from Vitis vinifera (herein
named as “STALK", Serine-Threonine Aurora-Like Kinase). Analysis of STALK's three-dimensional
structure confirmed its relationship to the subgroup of AURKA-like protein kinases.

Background
Microtubules are essential and universal cytoskeleton
component of all eukaryotic cells [1-3]. Due to their
dynamic behaviour, microtubules participate in many
cellular processes, including cell division, shape formation,
intracellular trafficking and organelle positioning. Their
protofilaments are composed of tubulin heterodimers, a
highly conserved microtubule protein [4,5]. Their multiple
isotypes and isoforms arise from variable gene expression as
well as post-translational modifications, most studied of

which are phosphorylation, acetylation, tyrosination/detyrosination, polyglutamylation, polyglycylation, and palmitoylation [3,6,7]. Among these modifications,
phosphorylation represents a special case because of its
wide occurrence [8] and ability to regulate structure/
function of around 30% of all proteins in eukaryotes [9,10].
The genome of Arabidopsis thaliana contains more then
1000 protein kinase genes [8]. Analysis of plant gene
similarity to the phosphate-binding regions of animal

tyrosine kinases showed that genes for Zap70 tyrosine
kinase family are the most similar to its potential plant
homologues [11,12]. tBLASTn http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/ scanning of Arabidopsis genome against mouse
Zap70 catalytic domain detected 503 consensus regions
corresponding to 494 protein kinases [12]. It means that
only ~50% of Arabidopsis kinases are homologous to
animal kinases. These genes are distributed between
different chromosomes: 150 - on I, 71 - on II, 94 - on III,
65 - on IV and 114 - on chromosome V. Analysis in
SMART http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/ confirms the
correspondence of their products to the models of
catalytic domains of S_TKc, STYKc, TyrKc, Pkinase,
Pkinase_Tyr, S_TKc, D1phk (SCOP: 88854), D1pme
(SCOP: 88854), D1qpca (SCOP: 88854), D1fgka
(SCOP: 88854), D1ir3a (SCOP: 88854), D1b6cb
(SCOP: 88854), 1A06, 1BYG, 1CM8, 1E1V, 1F3M,
1FGI, 1FOT, 1FPU, 1FVR, 1G3N, 1GOL, 1IA8, 1IAN,
1JPA, 1KOA, 1PME, 1QCF, 1QL6, 1QPD, 2PTK, 2SRC,
3LCK and d1b6cb kinases [12]. We previously demonstrated that microtubule tubulin in plants, like in
animals, is highly phosphorylated by different serine/
threonine [13] and tyrosine kinases [14,15]. It is
interesting that among potential products of the genes
we identified proteins corresponding to HMMs and
patterns of catalytic domains of atypical Tyr-specific
kinases (Pkinase_Tyr), dual specific (STYKc) and canonical animal tyrosine kinases (TyrKc) [11,12].
Phosphorylation of other proteins forming plant microtubules and involved in cell division, may also be
mediated by kinases having well characterized homologues in the animal kingdom [15]. Several microtubule
proteins show homology between animals and plants, e.
g., microtubule-associated proteins type I (MAP1) [16].
Therefore, these proteins may be expected to have similar
phosphorylation sites and to be phosphorylated by
corresponding conserved protein kinases.
Microtubule-related proteins are both species- and tissuespecific. Not surprisingly, these proteins differ significantly between plants and animals [16-18]. Accordingly,
the total microtubule-related kinase subset (termed
“kinome") is distinct in animals and plants. However,
microtubule proteins and associated kinases in plant cells
have not been studied in as much details as in their
human/animal counterparts. Further insight requires
identifying of plant kinases and corresponding genes.
All protein kinases are characterized by a conserved
catalytic (kinase) domain of 250-300 residues which, in
turn, contains unique sub-domain motifs related to
serine/threonine, tyrosine or dual kinases [19,20]. These
features enable search and identification by database
scanning using BLAST family tools [21]. It is this catalytic

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/S1/S14

domain with the characteristic structure/function relationship that aids in identification of new kinases by in
silico methods. The homology of these domains has been
previously used to identify several protein kinases from
multicellular organisms [22-27].
At present, several eukaryotic genomes have been completely sequenced and partially annotated. Specific examples of
plant genomic information include plant genomic data in
NCBI http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/, and, additionally, the
project Genoscope http://www.genoscope.cns.fr which provides information and in silico search engines for the
following plants: Arabidopsis thaliana, Ectocarpus siliculosus,
Medicago truncatula, Oryza sativa, Alnus glutinosa, Aphanomyces euteiches, Casuarina glauca, Citrus clementina, Eucalyptus, Juglans regia, Phaseolus vulgaris, Pinus pinaster, Populus
trichocarpa × deltoides, Quercus, Saccharum ssp., Theobrama
cacao, Triticum ssp., Vitis vinifera.
The goal of the present work was to identify plant
homologues of human kinases [28] that could participate in phosphorylation of microtubule proteins and/or
regulation of cell division. The investigated kinase
families included AGC (containing kinases A, G and C
families), CAMK (calcium/calmodulin-dependent), CK1
(casein kinase 1) and STE (homologues of yeast Sterile 7,
Sterile 11 and Sterile 20 kinases) protein kinases. For the
bioinformatic search and reconstruction of plant microtubule kinome, we used sequences of the following
human protein kinases: SLK, PAK6, PAK7 (from the
superfamily STE); MARK1, PASK (from the superfamily
CAMK); MAST2, AURKA (from the superfamily AGC);
TTBK1, TTBK2 (from the superfamily CK1); kinases Plk1
and Plk4 (not belonging to any specific group) [28].

Results and discussion
Using public databases and published research papers
[28-47], we have selected a range of human kinases involved
in microtubule proteins phosphorylation and cell division
regulation (Table 1). Depending on the complexity level of
protein kinases domain organization, either full sequences
(in case of AURKA) or catalytic domain sequence (SLK,
PAK7, MARK1, SLK, MAST2 TTBK1, PLK1, PLK4 and PASK,
as seen on Figure 1) were used for SIB BLASTp scanning. As a
result of the UniProt database scanning, we identified plant
homologues of human kinases from the families SLK,
MAST2 and AURKA.
Plant homologues of SLK_HUMAN (Q9H2G2)
Uniprot scanning against SLK_HUMAN catalytic domain
has revealed 11 plant homologues to STE20-like human
kinase (Table 2) from A. thaliana (Q9LQA1/AT1G69210,
O24527/At1g69220), Hordeum vulgare var. distichum
(Q9ARL7/GenBank: AY013246.1), O. sativa ssp. japonica

deposited proteins with unknown function. As an
exception, putative STE20 protein O24527/At1g69220
(TrEMBL database), from A. thaliana, is annotated as
potential homologue of protein kinase SIK1.
To identify the closest homologues among the potential
plant SLK-like kinases, we performed multiple alignments of catalytic domains with that of human SLK and
built a phylogenetic tree using the neighbour joining
method. According to the cladistic data, a common clade
with human SLK is formed by proteins Q9LQA1/
At1g69210 and O24527/At1g69220 from A. thaliana as
well as A9RVK0 from P. patens ssp. patens (Figure 3).

SLK was A9RVK0 from P. patens ssp. patens with the
identity of 46% and similarity of 65%. Inside the group,
the newly found plant homologues demonstrated a high
degree of sequence identity with conserved functionally
important positions specific to SLK kinases. Also, the
analysis of the known conserved residues, implicated in
substrate recognition in animal and A. thaliana STEkinases [49 Champion et al., 2004b], confirmed the
existence of the consensus motifs in catalytic loop region
of the subdomain VIb (animals: H-R-D-[LI]-K-[GA]-x-N
and A. thaliana: H-[RC]-D-[ILV]-K-x-x-N) and activation
loop of the subdomain VIII (animals: G-T-P-[YF]-[WY]M-A-P-E and A.thaliana: G-[TS]-x-x-[WYF]-[ML]-[AS]-PE) in all identified plant homologues(Figure 2).
Plant homologues of MAST2_HUMAN (Q6P0Q8)
As with SLK above, we searched the UniProt database for
potential plant homologues of MAST2_HUMAN with
the catalytic domain sequence identified in SMART tool
http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/[50].

Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL scanning has revealed 17 plant
MAST2_HUMAN homologues: 4 from V. vinifera, 4 from
A. thaliana, 2 from O. sativa ssp. japonica, 2 from O. sativa ssp.
indica, 1 from Medicago truncatula and 4 from P. patens ssp.
patens (Table 2). Animal MAST2 kinases contain a typical
auxiliary C-terminal S_TK_X domain (sTKc or sTKx), termed
C-terminal kinase domain [51], which, together with the
catalytic domain, is responsible for interactions with
microtubules [45]. Results of the domain architecture
analysis of full sequences of potential plant homologues
of human MAST2 kinase demonstrated that only 8 out of 17
found sequences have the C-terminal S_TK_X domain
(SMART SM00133): A7PHB5/GSVIVT00017880001,
A7NTE9/GSVIVT00014640001, A5BWH0/VITISV_001730
(all from V. vinifera); Q94F38/At1g48490, Q8GZ40/

A9T694/PHYPADRAFT_140919 (P. patens ssp. patens)
(Table 2). Consequently, the maximum consensus identity
for the query catalytic domain in BLASTp was observed with
a protein of unknown function, A7QWR7/
GSVIVT00008775001, from grape (identity-47%, similarity-63%) (Figure 4, Table 2). Also, the analysis of the known
conserved residues, implicated in substrate recognition in
animal and A. thaliana AGC-kinases[49]., confirmed the
existence of the consensus motifs in catalytic loop region of
the subdomain VIb (animals: [HY]-R-D-[LI]-K-[PL]-[ED]-N
and A. thaliana: [HY]-[RY]-D-[LI]-K-P-[ED]-N) and activation loop of the subdomain VIII (animals: G-T-P-[EA]-Y[IM]-A-P-E and A.thaliana: G-T-x-D-Y-L-A-P-E) in all identified plant MAST-homologues(Figure 2).
Phylogenetic analysis using Neighbour-Joining algorithm based on catalytic domain similarity demonstrated

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/S1/S14

that a common clade with human MAST2 is formed by
the following plant homologues: Q0WLU7/At1g45160,
Q9LE81/At5g62310 (A. thaliana), A7NTE9_VITVI*/
GSVIVT00014640001, A5BWH0_VITVI*/
VITISV_001730 (V. vinifera) and Q32YB5/GenBank:
AY770392.1 (M. truncatula) (Figure 5).
Therefore, the most distinguished plant homologues of
the MAST2 family are A7NTE9_VITVI*/
GSVIVT00014640001 (423 residues; chromosome 18),
A5BWH0_VITVI*/VITISV_001730 (550 residues; chromosome 5) from V. vinifera. In summary, based on the
analysis of human MAST2 and its potential plant
homologues for such functional elements as auxiliary
S_TK_X domain, Asn635 in putative active centre, ATPbinding motif (NP_BIND ATP) and Lys541, allowed us
to conclude that A7NTE9 (ORF Name
GSVIVT00014640001) from grape (Figure 6) is the
most promising for future research including spatial
structure reconstruction and molecular genetic methods.

Plant homologues of human Aurora A kinase
(STK6_HUMAN, O14965)
Protein kinase Aurora A belongs to the serine/threonine
kinase family AGC [28] and plays a fundamental role in
mitosis regulation [30,31]. In the case of Aurora A
kinase, we used the full sequence of human STK6
(AURKA; O14965) as a ‘query’ sequence for the BLASTp
search. As a result of database scanning, we have
identified 12 potential plant homologues of the STK6
kinase (Table 2) characterized by a similar domain
structure and high sequence similarity of kinase domains
and N- and C-terminals. Sequence similarity has reached
76-80% with the identity of 56-66%.(Table 2)

In an earlier paper on plant homologues of Aurora
kinases [52], the authors described a high level of
identity for Aurora catalytic domains from Arabidopsis
(64-95%). We now report additional homologues
belonging to O. sativa ssp. japonica (Q5SNH4/
Os01g0191800, Q4R1K7/OsAUR1), O. sativa ssp. indica
(A2WLL4/OsI_00731), P. balsamifera ssp. trichocarpa
(A9PFI9/POPTRDRAFT_819526), V. vinifera (A7P4F7/
GS VIVT00 032134 001, A5BPE0/VITISV_02 3325,
A7PY12/GSVIVT00026259001), Zea mays (B4F8A1/
LOC100191291) and A. thaliana (AUR2 Isof. 1 and
AUR2 Isof. 2 (At2g25880), AUR1/At4g32830, AUR3/
At2g45490). Together with a low gap percentage (1-2%),
such a high identity reflects not only sequence homology
but also homology of structure and function (Figure 7).
As evident from the annotations in the Swiss-Prot
database kinases AUR1/At4g32830, AUR2 Isof. 1 and
AUR2 Isof. 2 (At2g25880) and AUR3/At2g45490 from A.
thaliana could be functional homologues. Sequence

Figure 8
Phylogenetic tree of STK6_HUMAN (Aurora A) kinase and its plant homologues demonstrating their
phylogenetic relationships. Highlighted are the proteins identified in the paper.

Q4R1K7/OsAUR1 from O. sativa ssp. japonica in the
TrEMBL database [53] is also annotated as a potential
plant Aurora kinase.
As a result of highly conserved positions of the
functionally important residues and motifs, together
with homology of a primary sequence and domains
(analysis using domain profiles and hidden Markov
models) all S_TKc kinases were identified as plant
structural and functional homologues of human Aurora
A. Based on the cladistic analysis (Figure 8), the closest
homologue of STK6_HUMAN was a protein of unknown
function, A7PY12/GSVIVT00026259001 from V. vinifera
(identity-76%, similarity-56%, E-value = 3e-91).
Taking into account the critical role of Aurora kinases in
microtubule protein [46] and cell division regulation
[30,41,53], the plant homologue A7PY12/
GSVIVT00026259001 from V. vinifera, referred herein
as STALK (S_T AURKA LIKE KINASE), has been chosen
for in silico spatial structure prediction (Figure 9).
Sequence identity and similarity between STALK and
Aurora are 60.1% and 81.7%, respectively (Table 2). In
addition, identical and similar residues of STALK are
distributed evenly along the whole protein chain
(Figure 7), resulting in high reliability of the predicted
spatial structure.

Differences in spatial orientation between the STALK
residues in the active centre (Asp141, Lys143) and the
ATP-binding site (Leu24, Gly25, Arg26, Gly27, Lys28,
Phe29, Gly30, Arg31, Val32, Lys47) and Aurora A do not
exceed 0.3 Å, while the corresponding value for the
whole STALK domain is 0.43 Å. This finding confirms
more conserved spatial structure of these areas in
relationship to the whole protein. Together with the
high sequence homology, it further confirms similar
properties and catalytic functions of the template and
target proteins. The largest difference of the 3D structures
between STALK and Aurora is observed in STALK's
positions 169-173 (corresponding partly to the activation loop in Aurora A containing pThr288 which is
crucial for Aurora A activation [54]) and 233-238
(marked “c” and “d", respectively, on Figure 9). In
addition, Thr171 of the STALK's first variable range is
identical to Thr288 of Aurora (Figure 9).
The activation loop of animal Aurora kinases contains a
conserved motif (DFGWSxxxxxxxRxTxCGTxDYLPPE) carrying Thr288 phosphorylated by the cAMP-dependent
kinase (Figure 10) [54]. Also, the C-terminal part of the
Aurora kinases catalytic domain contains a so-called D2type destruction box motif [Rxx(L/I)xxVxxHPW] which is
thought to play a role in proteasome-dependent protein
degradation [53].

PDB: 2J4Z) and the protein of unknown function STALK (S_T AURKA LIKE KINASE, UniProt: A7PY12) from
V. vinifera. “a” (marked by blue) ATP-binding regions in Aurora A and STALK; “b” (marked by red) is active site; “c", “d”
(marked by green) are the most spatially variable regions between the two proteins; phosphorylated Thr residues (287, 288) in
the Aurora A are marked by brown. In bold are marked the only discrepancies between the corresponding functionally
important residues in Aurora A versus STALK: Asn146↔Arg31, Lys141↔Arg26 in “a"; Thr288↔Thr172 in variable region
“c"; Pro297↔Ala181 in the DFGWSxxxxxxxRxTxCGTxDYLPPE motif of the activating loop; Val377↔Ile263 in the D2_type
destruction box - Rxx(L/I)xxVxxHPW

In the STALK sequence we have identified, with near
100% identity, both motifs essential for animal Auroras
(Figure 10). This confirms functional homology of the
STALK (A7PY12/GSVIVT00026259001) protein and
human STK6 kinase.
Thus, the results of the search for plant homologues of
human kinases SLK, PAK6, PAK7 MARK1, MAST2,
TTBK1, TTBK2, AURKA, PLK1, PLK4 and PASK clearly
demonstrated the existence of corresponding plant
kinases SLK, MAST2 and AURKA. Plants do not seem
to contain homologues of kinases PAK6, PAK7, MARK1,
TTBK1, TTBK2, PLK1, PLK4 and PASK. This observation
could be explained by significant differences in microtubule proteins between plants and animals. Despite the
high similarity of animal and plant tubulins and the
presence of plant homologues for some other proteins
like MAP1 [56], there are differences in a number of
microtubule proteins. Plants, for example, do not
possess the type of MAP that contains tau repeats
(MAP2) [16,56], which explains absence of some protein
kinases phosphorylating given substrates in plants. At
the same time, kinases involved in pathways common in
animal and plant cells and phosphorylated conserved
sites in microtubule proteins (tubulin, MAP1, motor
proteins, etc.), exhibit considerable similarity.

An example of the corresponding homologue is Aurora A, a
kinase responsible for daughter centrosome formation,
asymmetric cell division and mitotic spindle formation
[46]. It is believed that the signal from the cyclin-dependent
kinase Cdk1 is relayed to the “second” level kinases, one of
which is Aurora A [38,46]. In human and animal cells alike,
AURKA (Aurora kinase A) is involved in the initiation of
mitosis [30]. Activation of AURKA occurs by means of
AURKA - BORA (protein BORA, FLJ22624; RP11-342J4.2;
C13orf34) complex formation [29,38,43,57]. A mechanism
was suggested recently, according to which BORA and
AURKA together control transition from phase G2 of cell
cycle to phase M [44]. According to the proposed mechanism, Cdk1 causes BORA to exit from the nucleus and binds
reversibly with Plk1. This changes Plk1 conformation so that
its Thr210 in the catalytic domain becomes accessible for
phosphorylation by AURKA with subsequent Plk1 activation
[44]. This leads to further Cdk1 activation, degradation of
Bora and, eventually, to start of mitosis [44,46] (Figure 11).
STALK, the closest plant homologue for human Aurora
kinase, may have a similar mode of interaction in plant
cells.
In relation to the potential plant homologues of kinase
SLK, some questions remain. Human SLK kinase is

highly expressed in various cell types and is involved in
the regulation of microtubule radial orientation [44]. By
analogy to the Xenopus laevis polo-like kinase xPlk1 [58],
it may be hypothesized that human protein kinase SLK
regulates activity of Plk1, the homologue of the X. laevis
Plx1 [32]. However, so far the data is inconclusive.

homologues of human PAK6, PAK7, MARK1, TTBK1,
TTBK2, PLK1, PLK4 and PASK. We hope that new
bioinformatic and instrumental genomic and proteomic data will reveal additional plant kinases involved
in microtubule protein phosphorylation and cell
division regulation.

In summary, we have identified plant homologues of
human kinases SLK, MAST2 and Aurora A. MAST2
plant homologues are identified here for the first time.
BLASTp scanning did not produce any plant

Methods

PLK4 and PASK were obtained from UniProtKB http://

www.uniprot.org/ and NCBI GenBank http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/[59] based on the information
presented in respective publications. The target
sequences were used to search for plant homologues
against the UniProt database (Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL)
[60]. We performed a BLASTp query (SIB BLAST Network
Service) with the protein weight matrix BLOSUM62,
with the following settings: (the E threshold = 10
(number of expected matches in a random database),
“Filter the sequence for low-complexity regions” and
“Gapped alignment” http://www.clustal.org[21].
The domain organization of identified plant homologues was analysed with Simple Modular Architecture
Research Tool (SMART - http://smart.embl-heidelberg.
de/) [50], Pfam http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/[61], PROSITE
http://www.expasy.ch/prosite/[62] and data from the
Swiss-Prot database. Protein kinase relation to specific
kinase family was confirmed on the basis of SMART
scanning results. Anonymous SMART scanning (RAWformat) was performed with activation of all analytical
modules. We also took into account the results of
pairwise alignments of query and subject sequences as
well as the results of the SMART analysis regarding
domain composition and organization (including
HMMER results). Homologues were selected based on
the meaning of the sequence identities (%), positives %
and E-value [63]. Multiple amino acid alignments were
generated with ClustalX (2.0.5) http://www.clustal.org
using the BLOSUM protein weight matrix [64].
Phylogenetic trees of plant homologues and human SLK,
MAST2 and STK6 (AURKA, Aurora A) were generated
based on multiple alignment results for the protein
kinase domain (SLK, MAST2) [19,20] or the full
sequence (STK6), using the neighbour-joining (NJ)
algorithm [65,66]. The boundaries of the protein kinase
domain were determined using SMART profiles. Dendrogram analysis and visualization was performed using
the TreeView X Ver.5 http://taxonomy.zoology.gla.ac.uk/
rod/treeview.html[67] and MEGA http://www.megasoftware.net/[68] programs. Conserved functionally important residues and motifs in plant homologues were
determined based on database annotation for template
sequences of corresponding human protein kinases
http://www.expasy.org.
For the three-dimensional (3D) structure reconstruction
of A7PY12/GSVIVT00026259001 from V. vinifera we
used method homologous (profile) modelling [69]. As a
matrix we used a 3D structure of AURORA2 kinase in a
complex with the inhibitor PHA-6806260 [70] from the
Protein Data Bank (PDB) (PDB ID 2J4Z) [71]. Promodel geometry optimisation was performed by energy
minimization using the L-BFGS method [72].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/S1/S14

Visualization of obtained three-dimensional model was
done using program DS Visualizer 2.0 (Accelrys Software
Inc. - http://accelrys.com/). Differences between structures of the STALK and AURORA were estimated by
calculating RMSD (root median square deviation) using
the Swiss-Pdb Viewer 4.0 software [73].
