Abstract
Background: NADPH-oxidases (Nox) and the related Dual oxidases (Duox) play varied biological and
pathological roles via regulated generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Members of the Nox/Duox
family have been identified in a wide variety of organisms, including mammals, nematodes, fruit fly, green
plants, fungi, and slime molds; however, little is known about the molecular evolutionary history of these
enzymes.
Results: We assembled and analyzed the deduced amino acid sequences of 101 Nox/Duox orthologs
from 25 species, including vertebrates, urochordates, echinoderms, insects, nematodes, fungi, slime mold
amoeba, alga and plants. In contrast to ROS defense enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase and catalase
that are present in prokaryotes, ROS-generating Nox/Duox orthologs only appeared later in evolution.
Molecular taxonomy revealed seven distinct subfamilies of Noxes and Duoxes. The calcium-regulated
orthologs representing 4 subfamilies diverged early and are the most widely distributed in biology. Subunitregulated Noxes represent a second major subdivision, and appeared first in fungi and amoeba. Nox5 was
lost in rodents, and Nox3, which functions in the inner ear in gravity perception, emerged the most
recently, corresponding to full-time adaptation of vertebrates to land. The sea urchin Strongylocentrotus
purpuratus possesses the earliest Nox2 co-ortholog of vertebrate Nox1, 2, and 3, while Nox4 first
appeared somewhat later in urochordates. Comparison of evolutionary substitution rates demonstrates
that Nox2, the regulatory subunits p47phox and p67phox, and Duox are more stringently conserved in
vertebrates than other Noxes and Nox regulatory subunits. Amino acid sequence comparisons identified
key catalytic or regulatory regions, as 68 residues were highly conserved among all Nox/Duox orthologs,
and 14 of these were identical with those mutated in Nox2 in variants of X-linked chronic granulomatous
disease. In addition to canonical motifs, the B-loop, TM6-FAD, VXGPFG-motif, and extreme C-terminal
regions were identified as important for Nox activity, as verified by mutational analysis. The presence of
these non-canonical, but highly conserved regions suggests that all Nox/Duox may possess a common
biological function remained in a long history of Nox/Duox evolution.
Conclusion: This report provides the first comprehensive analysis of the evolution and conserved
functions of Nox and Duox family members, including identification of conserved amino acid residues.
These results provide a guide for future structure-function studies and for understanding the evolution of
biological functions of these enzymes.

Background
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) [e.g., superoxide anion
(O2-), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)] are thought of as cytotoxic and mutagenic; however, recent data point to important biological roles for ROS [1-4]. Phagocytes generate
large amounts of O2- as part of their microbicidal activity,
which results from activation of a membrane-associated
NADPH oxidase. The key redox component of the oxidase
is flavocytochrome b558, which is comprised of an O2-generating catalytic subunit, gp91phox (a.k.a., Nox2), and
a non-catalytic subunit, p22phox [5-7]. Recent studies
indicate that similar NADPH oxidase systems are present
in a wide variety of non-phagocytic cells. While the nature
of these non-phagocyte NADPH oxidases is still being
defined, it is clear that they are functionally and structurally distinct from the phagocyte oxidases.
Nox2 has four conserved histidines that ligate two hemes
between the 3rd and 5th of 6 transmembrane (TM) α-helices and subregions that fold to provide binding cavities
for FAD and NADPH [2,5,7-10] (referred to here as the
"Nox domain" as shown in Figure 1A). These canonical
regions occupy about 35% of the Nox2 sequence; however, little is known about essential roles for the other
regions. Recently, mammalian homologues of Nox2 were
identified and now constitute the Nox/Duox family [2]. In
humans, there are five Noxes (Nox1-5) plus Duox1 and
Duox2 (Figure 1B). The activation of Nox2 has been
extensively studied and requires the association of essential cofactors. Nox2 alone is inactive and must associate
with p22phox to form a non-covalent heterodimer known
as flavocytochrome b558. Additional regulatory subunits
consist of p67phox, p47phox, p40phox and the small
GTPase Rac [2,5,6]. Upon cell activation, these subunits
translocate from the cytosol, assembling with and activating flavocytochrome b558 at the cell or phagosomal membrane. Respective homologues of p47phox and p67phox,
"Nox Organizer 1" (NOXO1) and "Nox Activator 1"
(NOXA1), regulate Nox1 [11-15], and NOXO1 also activates Nox3 [16-18]. In comparison, Nox4 requires
p22phox but no other subunits [19-21]. All members of
the human Nox/Duox family contain a flavocytochrome
moiety, which we refer to as the "Nox domain". Nox5
consists of a Nox domain plus an N-terminal EF-handcontaining calcium-binding domain [22,23]. Duox1/2
build on the Nox5 structure by adding an N-terminal peroxidase domain [24,25]. Nox/Duox family members are
reported in mouse, rat, cow, guinea pig, Takifugu rubripes
(T. rubripes), Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), Ciona
intestinalis (C. intestinalis), sea urchin, fungi, cellular slime
mold amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum (D. discoideum),
red alga Chondus crispus (C. crispus) and Porphyra yezoensis
(P. yezoensis), and green plants, including Arabidopsis thaliana (A. thaliana) [22,24,26-41]. Plant Noxes are similar
in domain structure to Nox5 [26,42]. The EF-hands of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/109

human Nox5, human Duox2, and an A. thaliana Nox are
essential for calcium-stimulated activity [23,25,26]. Red
alga C. crispus and P. yezoensis possess an unusual Nox
enzyme [31]. The algal Nox lacks an N-terminal EF-hand
region and no regulatory subunit homologs are present;
however, the algal Nox has 4 additional predicted transmembrane α-helices that are situated between the 1st and
2nd NADPH-binding sub-regions [31].
Genetic approaches have implicated Nox/Duox-derived
ROS in biological roles and pathological conditions,
including hypertension (Nox1), innate immunity (Nox2,
Duox), suppression of pathogen-induced cell death (plant
Nox), stomatal closure (plant Nox), otoconia formation
in the inner ear (Nox3), biosynthesis of extracellular
matrix (Duox), and thyroid hormone biosynthesis
(Duox1/2) [18,24,29,43-48]. Although widely expressed,
little is known about evolutionary relationships among
Nox proteins.
Herein, we analyzed Nox/Duox protein sequences from
14 vertebrates, one urochordate, one echinodermate,
three insects, one nematode, four fungi, two red algae, one
amoeba, and one green plant. Using this large data set, we
report (i) a novel molecular taxonomy and phylogeny of
Nox/Duox proteins, (ii) synteny of vertebrate Nox/Duox
genes by genome annotation, (iii) evolutionary substitution rates of vertebrate Nox proteins and regulatory subunits, and (iv) identification of key amino acid residues
and regions conserved among all Nox proteins.

Results
Molecular taxonomy of Nox domains
We assembled deduced amino acid sequences from 101
Nox/Duox genes (see Additional file 4). Each Nox candidate was preliminarily aligned with human Noxes to
check whether the sequences conserved canonical regions
required for O2- generation, such as the four heme-ligating
histidines corresponding to His-101, His-115, His-209,
His-222 of human Nox2 (GenBank™ No. NM_000388).
Nox genes are present in most eukaryotes including vertebrates, urochordates, echinodermates, nematodes,
insects, fungi, plants amoeba, and red alga, but not in
prokaryotes. Schematic domain structures of Nox/Duox
family proteins of human, the green plant A. thaliana, fungus Magnaporthe grisea (M. grisea), the cellular slime mold
amoeba (D. discoideum), and the red alga (C. crispus) are
shown in Figure 1B. All members of Nox/Duox family
expressed a Nox domain containing the six transmembrane segments and flavocytochrome moiety (Figure 1A).
In addition, Nox5, Duoxes, At-rboh-D, fungal NoxC, and
amoeba NoxC all contained an EF hand-containing calcium-binding domain (for details, see the section for EFhand motif). Duoxes also contained a peroxidase homology domain; whereas, amoeba Noxes B and C also con-

tained an asparagine-rich region (labled "N in Figure 1B).
The malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae (A. gambiae)
genome encoded one unique Nox gene, Nox-mosquito
(referred to here as "NoxM"), which encodes only the Nox
domain and no calcium-binding domain (Figure 1B).
A molecular taxonomy, constructed by aligning the
deduced amino acid sequences of the Nox domains
(omitting other domains and unique features, such as the
extra transmembrane domains of algae NoxD) revealed
seven subfamilies (Figure 2). The subgroup consisting of
Nox1-3 includes Noxes that are regulated by regulatory
subunits, including Nox2, the classical phagocyte oxidase
catalytic subunit (numbers 11–20 in Figure 2). Nox2 of
the urochordate C. intestinalis (# 26 in Figure 2) branched
from a root common to vertebrate Nox1-3 and conserves
features common to all Nox1-3 proteins. Sea urchin S.
purpuratus belongs to Echinodermata, which diverged
early from an ancestor common to urochordates and vertebrates [49], and the S. purpuratus genome had two Nox2like proteins, Nox2A and Nox2B (#27 and #28 in Figure
2), which branched from a root common to all chordate
Noxes 1–3. The taxonomy indicates that the S. purpuratus
Nox2 isologs represent a branch closest to the primordial
ancestor of all isologs of vertebrate Nox1, Nox2 and Nox3.
The Nox4 subfamily includes a urochordate isolog and
branched from a root close to the Nox1-3 subfamily. Both
the Nox4 and the Nox1-3 subfamilies originated from a
common branch, and together form the two subgroups
that are known to require a p22phox subunit for activity
and/or stability [19,20,50]. Neither of these subgroups
occurs in green plants, fungi, or nematodes. For example,
the S. purpuratus genome did not contain a distinct Nox4
ortholog. Although the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster
(D. melanogaster) and honeybee Apis mellifera (A. mellifera) did not possess an ortholog of Nox1-3 or Nox4, the
malaria mosquito A. gambiae possessed one unique Nox
gene, NoxM (mosquito-Ag NoxM, #38 in Figure 2). We
also searched for the gene in another mosquito genome
Aedes aegypti (A. aegypti), the principal vector of yellow
and dengue fevers, using the NCBI BLAST server [51]. The
A. aegypti genome contained one NoxM ortholog (GenBank™ No. EAT37894) similar to A. gambiae NoxM, and
also had Nox5 and Duox orthologs (GenBank™ No.
EAT46816 and EAT40728, respectively). The A. gambiae
NoxM protein branched from a root common to all chordate Nox 4 (Figure 2); however, the bootstrap value of the
branch was only 60%, making it unclear whether NoxM
belongs to the p22phox-regulated subgroups (Nox4 and
Nox1-3) or to the NoxA/NoxB subgroup. The A. gambiae
genome did not encode a distinct p22phox ortholog, suggesting that the NoxA/NoxB subgroup (which is p22phoxindependent) may be a more appropriate assignment for
this NoxM.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/109

The Nox5 subgroup was composed of the orthologs (#'s
39–52 in Figure 2) present in vertebrates [except for Mus
muscles (M. muscles) and Rattus norvegicus (R. norvegicus)],
echinoderm, and insects; however, Nox5 was not found in
the urochordate C. intestinalis, or the nematode C. elegans.
A Nox5 ortholog of a green-spotted pufferfish Tetraodon
nigroviridis (T. nigroviridis) was classified in the Nox5 subgroup, as shown in Figure 2 (# 47), but the predicted protein does not contain the N-terminal extension with the
calcium-binding domain that is present in other Nox5
orthologs (amino acid sequence is shown in Additional
file 4). However, the nucleotide sequence around the presumed start codon (gaggcaugc, methinone codon underlined) also did not match to a consensus Kozak sequence
[cc(a/g)ccaugg] [52], suggesting that the reported
sequence is likely to be incomplete. A Nox5 ortholog (#
45) of zebrafish Danio rerio (D. rerio) also did not contain
the presumed start codon and the calcium-binding
domain (sequence is shown in Additional file 4), suggesting that the sequence of this Nox5 ortholog is also incomplete. The genome of sea urchin S. purpuratus encodes two
Nox5 isologs, Nox5A and Nox5B (Figure 2). The Duox
subgroup showed broad expression in Bilateria, such as
vertebrates, urochordates, echinoderms, nematodes and
insects, but was not found in amoeba, fungi, or plants.
Plant Nox homologs, previously termed "respiratory burst
oxidase homologues (rboh)" [26], formed a distinct subgroup (Figure 2), and A. thaliana had 10 rboh homologues, suggesting specialized functions or tissue
expression.
Noxes representing the NoxA/NoxB subgroup and the
NoxC subgroup were present in fungi, and all fungi examined contained both NoxA and NoxB, except for Aspergillus nidulans (A. nidulans), which possessed only a NoxA
gene. Yeast [Schizosaccharomyces pombe (S. pombe) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae)] did not possess any
Noxes. The domain structure of the NoxA ortholog is similar to that of Nox1-Nox4; whereas, NoxB proteins also
have a short N-terminal extension that does not contain
any recognizable domains or motifs (Figure 1B). Fungal
NoxC, present in M. grisea and Fusarium graminearum (F.
graminearum), has an N-terminal EF-hand domain (Figure
1B). The slime mold amoeba D. discoideum, a protozoan
that straddles the boundary between animals and plants
[53], contained three Nox isologs, NoxA, NoxB, and NoxC
(Figure 1B). Amoeba NoxC has an EF-hand domain as
well as an N-terminal extension containing an asparaginerich region ("N", Figure 1B); however, NoxA and NoxB
both lack the EF-hand domain (Figure 1B). The EF-handcontaining subfamilies (Nox5, Duox, NoxC, and plant
Nox) were the most abundant of the Noxes, comprising
well over half of the taxonomic tree (Figure 2). Unlike
other members of the NoxC/NoxD family, algal Noxes (#s
100 and 101 in Figure 2) do not contain an EF-hand

domain (Figure 1B), but branched from a root shared by
amoeba and fungal NoxC (Figure 2). Therefore, we refer
to these algal Nox proteins that lack an EF hand domain
as NoxD, which together with NoxC form a distinct subgroup. Because they share structural features common to
EF hand-containing Noxes, we speculate that that these
Noxes may be regulated by an as-yet unknown calciumbinding protein.
Synteny of Nox/Duox genes in vertebrates
A summary of the occurrence and number of Nox/Duox
genes in vertebrates (tetrapods, teleost fish), urochordate,
echinodermate, nematode, insects, fungi, green plants
amoeba, and red alga is shown in Figure 3A. Although we
performed extensive BLAST searches [54,55], some Noxes
did not appear to be present in all vertebrate genomes. For
example, a rat or mouse ortholog of Nox5 and a frog Xenopus tropicalis (X. tropicalis) or teleost fish ortholog of Nox3
was not found (Figure 3A). Teleost fish listed in Figure 3A
had one complete Duox ortholog, but no paralog corresponding to mammalian Duox2. To substantiate that
these genes were indeed absent, we compared chromosomal synteny (preserved orders of genes between related
organisms) of Nox/Duox orthologs in vertebrates. Syntenies of C. intestinalis Noxes were so divergent from those
of vertebrates that it was not possible to perform syntenic
analyses for this species. Syntenies of Nox1, Nox2 and
Nox4 (Figs. 3B, 3C, and 3E, respectively) were the most
highly preserved among Nox/Duox genes.

The human Nox3 gene is positioned following TIAM2,
TFBIM and CLDN20 on chromosome 6 (Figure 3D), a
synteny that was conserved in mammals and chickens
Gallus gallus (G. gallus). Puffer fish, fugu T. rubripes and
tetraodon T. nigroviridis lacked a Nox3 ortholog, and
TIAM2, TFBIM and CLDN20 were followed instead by
FILIP1, TMEM30A and COL12A1. In the genome of X.
tropicalis, there was greater variation in synteny: TFBIM
was present, but neither Nox3 nor other linked markers
were seen. A Nox3 gene was not found in the genome of
zebrafish D. rerio, but nucleotide fragments encoding
these marker genes of D. rerio were too short to demonstrate the absence of Nox3 by syntenic analysis. Thus,
Nox3 emerged during evolution sometime after the emergence of fish and amphibians from a common ancestor of
birds and mammals.
The synteny of genetic markers surrounding Nox5 was
highly conserved in human, dog Canis familliaris (C. familliaris), mouse, rat, chicken, cow Bos taurus (B. taurus),
opossum Monodelphis domestica, (M. domestica, a Nox5
ortholog sequence DDBJ™ accession No. BR000304) and
frog (Figure 3F). We also found Nox5 gene fragments in
rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus (O. cuniculus) and armadillo
Dasypus novemcinctus (D. novemcinctus) draft-sequenced

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/109

genomes (DDBJ accession No. BR000301 and BR000302,
respectively). However, rodents (mouse and rat in this
study) lacked Nox5, clearly demonstrating that this gene
had been lost. Interestingly, pufferfish T. rubripes and T.
nigroviridis had Nox5-like genes, but the gene markers
were present on a different scaffold fragment (Figure 3F).
Mammals and frog X. tropicalis each had two paralogs of
Duox (Figure 3G), while chicken had only one. Fish
genomes possessed a single Duox gene that followed a
single NIP gene (Figure 3G). Like Duox, the NIP gene has
also undergone gene duplication to form NIP1 and NIP2.
Interestingly, NIP1 and NIP2 in Figure 3G are identical to
DuoxA1 and DuoxA2, respectively, proteins that were
recently described to participate in the activation and maturation of Duoxes [56]. Due to the complexity of the tetraploid genomes of zebrafish and incomplete genomic
sequence, however, we cannot rule out a second Duox in
another chromosomal location.
Structural variations among Nox domains
The molecular taxonomy of Noxes in Figure 2 suggested
that unique structural features characterize each Nox subfamily. Noxes possess five loops (loops A-E) that join TM
regions ("I-VI" in Figure 4), and also segments connecting
canonical subdomains, such as FAD-binding regions
("FAD1" and "FAD2" in Figure 4) and predicted NADPHbinding regions ("NADPH1-4" in Figure 4) [2,8-10,34].
Alignment of Nox domains demonstrates that each Nox
subgroup has characteristic sizes of these loops and segments (Figure 4 and detailed sizes are shown in Additional file 1). For example, Nox1-3 have a longer C-loop,
Nox4 has a longer E-loop, and plant Noxes have an
extended D-loop (Figure 4). Nox5 proteins have shortened A- and E-loops and a long and variable insertion
between FAD- and NADPH-binding domains; whereas,
the fungal NoxC and algal NoxD have an extended C-terminus and long insertions between NADPH-binding subregions. Thus, each Nox/Duox ortholog has characteristic
structural features conserved throughout evolution. The
differences in loop size indicate that the basic catalytic
function of the Nox domain is able to tolerate considerable structural variation in this region. Certain loops, especially "loop B" and "TM6-FAD" [the region between 6th
transmembrane segment ("VI" in Figure 4) and FAD1binding subregion ("FAD1" in Figure 4)] were conserved
in size among all Noxes, perhaps pointing to their structural or functional importance.
Substitution rates of Nox domains and Nox regulatory
subunits
To compare the rates of evolution among Nox subfamilies, we calculated substitution rates among the vertebrate orthologs. For Nox2 and Duox1/2, the rates,
expressed as amino acid substitutions per site per 109
years, were notably lower (0.34 ± 0.013 and 0.32 ± 0.011,

The regulator subunits p47phox, NOXO1, p67phox,
NOXA1, and p22phox that are seen in human are also
observed in other vertebrates (except for the absence of

absence of a NOXA1 ortholog in tetraodon T. nigroviridis,

the Nox regulatory subunits are shown in Figure 5B. Like
Nox2, the substitution rates of p22phox and the Nox2 regulators, p47phox and p67phox, are significantly lower than
those of the Nox1 regulatory subunits, NOXO1 and
NOXA1 (Figure 5B).

Identification of critical amino acids common to all Nox/
Duox proteins
Key structural features of Noxes have been retained over
hundreds of millions of years, implying key conserved residues from a common ancestor. Conserved amino acids
were identified by aligning the 101 sequences of the Nox
domain shown in SD2, but omitting hydrophobic amino
acids in transmembrane regions. Sixty-eight residues were
highly conserved in all Nox proteins (Figs. 6 and 7A). His101, His-115, His-209, and His-222 [human (h)-Nox2
numbering] were present in all Noxes except for two Duox
isologs (X. tropicalis Duox2 and C. familliaris Duox1), consistent with their proposed roles [57] as axial and distal
ligands for the two heme irons. Sequences of the two

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/109

divergent Duox isologs encode leucines at the residues
corresponding to His-115 of h-Nox2 (Figure 6), suggesting that these Duox proteins are probably not able to produce ROS, or that they might have an unknown function
conferred by the other canonical structures, such as FAD
and NADPH binding sites. These findings also imply that
a single Duox protein is sufficient to fulfill the biological
role of the enzyme in these species. Specific amino acids
were conserved in the two canonical FAD-binding subregions (FAD1-2) and in or near the four NADPH-binding
subregions (NADPH1-4). Four additional conserved
regions were noted: B-loop, TM6-FAD, VXGPFG-motif,
and the extreme C-terminus (Figure 6 and filled circles of
Figure 7A). We compared these positions to point mutations previously identified in Nox2 from variants of Xlinked chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). CGD is a
genetic immune disorder characterized by a functionally
defective phagocyte NADPH oxidase, and the X-linked
form is caused by mutations in the Nox2 gene. Of 23
known CGD point mutations [58-60], 14 are in amino
acids conserved among all Noxes (Figs. 6 and 7A). These
naturally occurring mutations in CGD confirm the importance of these residues to Nox function and stability.
Among the CGD point mutants that are conserved among
all Noxes, His-209-Arg, Gly-389-Glu, Leu-420-Pro and
Trp-516-Arg are Nox2 protein-null CGD mutants (X910),
and result in the absence of Nox2 protein in the patient's
neutrophils. The loss of Nox2 is thought to be due to
destabilization of the protein structure and rapid protein
degradation. His-101-Tyr and His-338-Tyr cause
decreased Nox2-expression in CGD (X91-), suggesting
that in addition to being functionally important in enzymatic activity or activation of Noxes, many of the 68
amino acids conserved among all Noxes are likely to be
involved in maintaining or stabilizing the structure of the
Nox domain. There were several exceptions among these
otherwise highly conserved residues (indicated by asterisks
in Figure 6), and these are listed in Additional file 11.
These rare exceptions could be due to mis-sequencing of
the genome or to tolerance of evolutionary changes in the
species. To test functional importance of the B-loop,
VXGPFG-motif, TM6-FAD region, and C-terminus, we
generated 11 point mutations of human Nox2. Individual
mutation of these conserved amino acids markedly inhibited and in some cases, completely abolished ROS production in a cell model system in which Nox2 and its
regulatory subunits were also expressed (Figure 7B).
Therefore, along with the canonical domains for cofactor
binding, sequence comparisons identified additional
regions that are important for Nox2-dependent ROS generation. Nox2 is expressed as a protein of 65 kDa ("immature Nox2" in Figure 7C), which is then glycosylated to
generate a form with an apparent molecular size of 91
kDa ("mature Nox2" in Figure 7C). None of the mutants
of Nox2, except for Gly-389, affected the expression of

Nox2 protein (Figure 7C); however, Nox2 mutated at Arg80 (B-loop) or Gly-322 (TM6-FAD region) failed to form
a complex with p22phox, as determined by co-immunoprecipitation, and these mutations also failed to become
glycosylated (Figure 7C). Protein of the Nox2 mutations
in Gly-389 was not detected by Western blotting, which is
likely due to de-stabilization of the protein or possibly to
impaired recognition by the monoclonal antibody
because the epitope of antibody overlaps Gly-389 [61].
Variations in calcium-binding domain structures
The majority of Noxes in Figure 2 fall into calcium-regulated subgroups. Several calcium-binding motifs have
evolved, including the EF-hand motif, which is ubiquitous in eukaryote and prokaryote genomes. The EF-hand
motif was first described in the crystal structure of parvalbumin [62]. This motif has a characteristic helix-loophelix (HLH) structure, consisting of approximately 30 residues, with the 12 residues situated in the loop contributing to the calcium binding [63]. By comparing the Nox/
Duox sequences with the PROSITE database [64], 51 Nox/
Duox sequences contained single or multiple EF-hands
(see Additional file 2). They include animal Nox5 and
Duox, plant Nox At-rboh, and NoxC of amoeba and fungi
(Figure 8A). Nox5 had four EF-hand motifs (Figure 8A).
The N-terminal motif was non-canonical [23] (see Additional file 2); however, this motif is also crucial for ROSgenerating activity of Nox5, as a truncated mutation of the
non-canonical EF-hand motif in human Nox5 lacked calcium-dependent ROS generation in nox5-transfected
HEK293 cells (T. Kawahara and J. D. Lambeth, unpublished observation). Although there are rare exceptions to
the consensus sequences in the C-terminal EF-hand motif
sequences of Duox (indicated by asterisks in Additional
file 2), Duox has two canonical EF-hands corresponding
to the 2nd and 3rd EF-hands of Nox5 (Figure 8B). To add
confidence to the alignment between EF-hand motif
regions of Nox5 and Duox, a structural homology model
of regions containing EF-hands of human Nox5 and
human Duox1 was developed using the comparative protein modeling method (SWISS-MODEL [65]). Although
the region between the 2nd EF-hand and TM II domains of
Duox lacks a classical EF-hand motif, this region of
human Duox1 is predicted to form a HLH structure
("HLH" in Figure 8B and arrow head in the right panel of
Figure 8C), similar to the predicted HLH structure comprising the 4th EF-hand motif of human Nox5 ("EF-IV" in
the left panel of Figure 8C). According to alignment of
Duox sequences shown in Additional file 8, this additional "HLH" region of Duox seems to be widely conserved among animal Duox proteins, with the exception
of chicken G. gallus and fugu T. rubripes orthologs. Thus,
Duox and Nox5 possess structural homology in these
regions, even though the total number of canonical EFhand motifs is different. As shown in Figure 8B, the align-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/109

ment also indicates that A. thaliana At-rboh and amoeba
D. discoideum NoxC each possess two EF-hands that corresponded to the 3rd and 4th motifs of Nox5; whereas, the
2nd EF-hand regions of all At-rboh proteins did not correspond to the EF-hand consensus sequence (see Additional
file 2). Like At-rboh proteins, one of EF-hand motifs of
amoeba NoxC did not follow the consensus sequence
(indicated by asterisks in Figure 8). Nevertheless, these
inconsistencies in the consensus sequence of EF-hands do
not eliminate the possibility that such EF-hand-like motifs
could bind to calcium ion, as a number of exceptions to
this rule have been found [63,66]. A single canonical EFhand is detected in two fungal NoxC (M. grisea and F.
graminearum), which corresponds to the position of the
3rd motif of Nox5 (see Additional file 2). Thus, binding of
calcium to a single EF-hand may be sufficient in some
Noxes to impart calcium regulatability. In contrast, calcium binding to Nox5 is likely to be cooperative, and
might be expected to permit regulation over a narrower
range of calcium concentrations.
Phylogeny of Noxes
The relationship between the phylogenic tree of organisms and the occurrence of Nox/Duox family genes (Figure 9) was determined by synteny and sequence
information. Calcium-regulated, EF-hand-containing
Noxes are not only abundant (Figure 8A), but also
appeared very early during the evolution of eukaryotes.
Nox3 appeared late in evolution, corresponding to the
permanent transition of vertebrates from water to land. A
primordial Nox2 appeared first in echinoderms, while
Nox4 first appeared somewhat later in urochordates.
Nox1 emerged relatively later in teleost fish. The mosquitoes A. gambiae and A. aegypti (but not fruit fly or ant) have
NoxM gene (Figure 9) that is difficult to classify, but may
belong in the NoxA/NoxB family, as discussed above (see
Figure 2). Red macro-algae are eukaryotes and are thought
to have branched earlier than plants from a common root
[67]. The red algae C. crispus and P. yezoensis possess
NoxD, which lacks an N-terminal EF-hand region (Figure
1B). Although these species do not appear to possess any
regulatory subunit homologs [31], NoxD contains an
additional 4 predicted transmembrane regions. The function of such additional transmembrane regions is
unknown, and it is not yet clear whether this atypical Nox
represents an ancestral prototype or a later adaptation.

Discussion
This report provides the first extensive analysis of Nox
sequences and synteny throughout evolution and provides a conceptual framework for future structure/enzymatic function studies and for understanding the diversity
of biological functions of these enzymes. Molecular taxonomy (Figure 2) revealed seven Nox/Duox subfamilies
rather than the three that were previously identified based

Figure 9
Occurrence of Noxes in the phylogenetic tree
Occurrence of Noxes in the phylogenetic tree. A schematic phylogeny of organisms was created from genomic information [49, 53, 67, 91]. Branch lengths are not proportional to divergence. "Mammals" in this figure include H. sapiens, C. familliaris, R. norvegicus, and M. musculus. Among fungi, yeast (S. pombe and S. cerevisiae) lacked Noxes, although they did possess a
protein with similar structural domains, Fre (see Additional file 9). The asterisk indicates an apparent lack of EF-hand-containing

on the presence or absence of calcium-binding and peroxidase domains [2]. Significantly, Noxes are not present in
prokaryotes. One can speculate that while defense
enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase, evolved very early
to protect aerobic organisms to protect against accidentally-generated ROS, later organisms subsequently developed the capacity to generate ROS in a regulated,
"deliberate" manner, with specific regulatory subunits coevolving with specific Noxes. The earliest Nox2 ortholog
seems to have appeared in the sea urchin S. purpuratus. A
number of investigators have suggested that sea urchin
has phagocytic cells that express an ortholog of the complement component C3 and can phagocytose against
invading microbes [68-70]. Although it is unclear whether

these cells produce ROS to kill microbes, the taxonomy
shown in Figure 2 implies that the sea urchin expresses a
Nox2 ortholog that might play a role in the innate
immune response.
The synteny of each Nox/Duox member raises new questions about Nox/Duox evolution. For example, Nox3 in
mouse inner ear is essential for formation of otoconia,
mineralized structures that participate in the vestibular
system in perception of gravity [44]. Fish and amphibians
also have otoconia (called otoliths in fish) but do not
express Nox3 (Figure 3). This may implicate another Nox,
for example Nox1 ortholog, in otoconia formation prior
to Nox3 appearance in land vertebrates, or it may point to

Page 14 of 21

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:109

a unique function of Nox3 in land vertebrates. Kiss et al.
have suggested that lactoperoxidase (LPO) functions in
peroxidation of the lipid envelope of globular substance
in the inner ear together with Nox3 [18]. Interestingly,
molecular taxonomy of animal heme peroxidases demonstrates that LPO orthologs emerged in birds and mammals, but not in fish (T. Kawahara and J. D. Lambeth,
unpublished observation). It implies that Noxes and their
physiological partners evolved simultaneously, resulting
in gaining a new function. Mosquito has a unique Nox
gene, NoxM. Although a physiological function of NoxM
is completely unknown, a unique appearance of NoxM
gene in the species imply a possible relationship between
NoxM and sucking of blood or a playing role as a principal vector of the pathogen. While the function of Nox5 is
not yet understood, its loss in rodents suggests that
another Nox may compensate in these species, implying a
certain degree of plasticity of Nox isoform function. Alternatively, Nox5 may not perform an essential function, at
least in short-lived species.
It is of interest to compare residue substitution rates
among Nox isologs, since all members possess fundamentally similar structures in their flavocytochrome domains,
including a high degree of conservation of binding sites
for prosthetic groups. Substitution rates vary among different proteins, such as EGF (~ 2.5), NGF (~ 1.0), lactate
dehydrogenase (~ 0.5), cytochrome c (~ 0.3), and histone
H3 (~ 0.014) [71]. The substitution rates of Nox/Duox
subfamilies ranged from 0.3 ~ 0.7 (Figure 5); whereas,
those of p22phox, organizer proteins (p47phox and
NOXO1), and activator proteins (p67phox and NOXA1)
were 0.5 ~ 1.2. The substitution rates of Nox2 and its regulatory subunits, p47phox and p67phox, were relatively
low, implying evolutionary changes in these proteins are
more poorly tolerated. Such a result may be explained by
the importance of the biological function of Nox2 in host
defense and by the stringent regulation of this enzyme system to prevent inappropriate activation leading tissue
damage [5,58,59]. In addition, the Nox2 system requires
multiple protein interactions among catalytic and regulatory subunits with upstream regulatory subunits and lipids, and these undoubtedly impose strict limitations on
the number of tolerated mutations. Although incompletely understood, substitution data point to the critical
nature of Duox functions, since changes in the Duox
sequence are also poorly tolerated over evolutionary time
(Figure 5). Duoxes are implicated in thyroid hormone
biosynthesis [43] and innate immunity in lung [72], and
are distributed in a variety of other tissues where they perform unknown functions. Duox is also implicated in fertilization in sea urchin, where H2O2-supported crosslinking of fertilization envelope proteins prevents
polyspermy [73].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/109

In contrast to other eukaryotes, yeast (S. pombe and S. cerevisiae) did not possess Noxes. Yeast ferric reductase (Fre)
has a domain structure similar to Noxes but participates in
iron uptake rather than oxygen reduction [74]. Alignment
between human Nox2 and Fre proteins demonstrates that
the sequence of Fre proteins is very different from the
Noxes except for the VXGPFG-motif and NADPH-binding
site residues (see Additional file 9). This suggests that this
distant homolog has evolved in yeast to carry out an
entirely different function, and it is debatable whether it
should even be classified with the Nox family.
In addition to binding residues for prosthetic groups, the
present study has identified four additional regions (Bloop, TM6-FAD, VXGPFG-motif, and C-terminus) as critical for function in all Noxes. The specific functions of
these regions are not yet fully understood; however, mutational analysis demonstrates their importance (Figure
7B). The B-loop (Arg-80) and TM6-FAD (Gly-322) regions
of Nox2 appear to participate directly or indirectly in
binding to p22phox (Figure 7C), since their mutation prevented co-immunoprecipitation of Nox2 and p22phox. In
addition, these mutations prevented glycosylation of
Nox2 to form the mature 91 kDa form of the protein, supporting the concept that association with p22phox is a necessary pre-requisite for glycosylation [75]. Nevertheless,
these two amino acid residues are also conserved in Noxes
that do not require p22phox (e.g., human Nox5). Thus,
these residues might mediate another important interaction in Nox5 that is analogous to that with p22phox, and
ongoing studies are investigating the roles of these residues in Nox5 function. The presence of non-canonical,
but highly conserved residues and regions that are shown
in Figure 7A suggests that Noxes might have an unknown
common feature relevant to the mechanism of activation
or a common biological function. Moreover, these conserved regions may also provide a key to identifying a
novel common molecule that interacts and co-operates
with all Nox/Duox proteins.

Conclusion
In summary, we report herein an exhaustive analysis of
Nox/Duox protein family. The present studies provide a
new molecular classification system in which Nox and
Duox proteins are organized into seven distinct subfamilies. These studies also identify Nox3 as the most
recently emerged Nox. Calcium-regulated, EF-hand-containing Noxes appeared very early during the evolution of
eukaryotes. Two mosquitoes possess a unique Nox gene,
NoxM, but not fruit fly or ant. Consistent with the physiological importance of Nox2 in innate immunity and
Duox for hormone synthesis and host defense, these two
Nox proteins are more stringently conserved of all Noxes.
By comparison of amino acid sequences, 68 residues were
identified as highly conserved among all Nox/Duox

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:109

orthologs, and the B-loop, TM6-FAD, VXGPFG-motif, and
extreme C-terminal regions were identified as important
for Nox activity. Thus, this report provides a conceptual
basis for understanding the evolutionary history of Noxes
and Duoxes and provides key structural information relevant to the activation mechanisms of modern Nox/Duox
proteins.

Methods

Nox/Duox family gene sequences were assembled from
the following species: Homo sapiens (H. sapiens, human),

yezoensis (alga-Py).

In addition to gene accession numbers that have been
published
in
papers
cited
above
[26,28,30,31,33,39,41,42],
existing
homologues/
orthologs of Nox/Duox were searched using NCBI
HomoloGene [76]. Human Nox1-Nox5, Duox1, and
Duox2; dog Nox1, Nox4, Duox1, and Duox2; mouse
Nox1-Nox4, Duox1, and Duox2; rat Nox1-Nox4, Duox1,
and Duox2; chicken Nox3; and fruit fly Nox5 and Duox
amino acid sequences were obtained from GenBank, and
accession numbers are shown in Additional file 4. BLASTP
searches were performed for amino acid sequences predicted computationally from genomes of C. familliaris, R.
norvegicus, M. musculus, D. novemcinctus, O. cuniculus, G.
gallus, X. tropicalis, D. rerio, T. rubripes, T. nigroviridis, O. latipes, C. intestinalis and C. elegans [55]. Sequences that had
>50% identity to the sequence of the closest template
were selected.
To identify the Nox/Duox orthologs of sea urchin S. purpuratus and insects (D. melanogaster, A. mellifera, A. gambiae), BLASTP searches were performed using the NCBI
sea urchin protein database [77] and the NCBI Eukaryotic
Genome Database [78], respectively. Fungi Genome
BLAST and NCBI BLASTP [51] and DictyBase BLASTP [79]
were used to search for Nox homologs in fungi (P. anserina, A. nidulans, M. grisea, and F. graminearum) and
amoeba (D. discoideum), respectively. The presence of 10

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/109

genes encoding A. thaliana Nox homologs has been predicted [42], which was confirmed by searching the TIGR
A. thaliana Protein Database [80]. Sequences and accession numbers of assembled Nox orthologs are listed in
Additional file 4, and information on additional database
searching is described in Additional file 12. Assembled
sequences, including newly defined or previously misannotated sequences, were annotated based on molecular
taxonomy analysis of the Nox domain (Figure 2), and
these sequences were deposited as third party annotation
(TPA) sequences in GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ database
(accession No. BR000261–BR000304). All amino acid
sequences analyzed in this study are shown in Additional
file 4 (Nox/Duox proteins) and Additional file 9 (Fre proteins).
To estimate evolutionary substitution rates, we screened
orthologs of the regulatory subunits, p22phox, p47phox,
NOXO1, p67phox, and NOXA1 in vertebrates (H. sapiens,
C. familliaris, R. norvegicus, M. musculus, G. gallus, X. tropicalis, D. rerio, T. rubripes, T. nigroviridis) using servers
described above. In this study, partial Nox/Duox or regulatory subunit genes, which lacked either a presumed start
codon or a stop codon, were assumed to be intact if they
showed >50% identity to the closest homolog. All amino
acid sequences of the regulatory subunits analyzed in this
study are shown in Additional file 6.
Phylogenic analysis and synteny
Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses
were carried out with ClustalW [81,82]. Phylogenetic trees
were reconstructed by the neighbor-joining method
[83,84] implemented with Kimura 2-parameter distances
[85]. Each node of the phylogenetic tree was evaluated by
1,000 bootstrap replications [86]. Amino acid sequences
of Nox and Duox were trimmed and aligned to the length
of human Nox2 (see Additional file 5). The additional 4
predicted transmembrane regions of the algal Nox
orthologs [residues 372–676 of C. crispus NoxD GenBank™ No. AAZ73480.1 and residues 363–778 of P.
yezoensis NoxD GenBank™ No. ABA18724.1] were also
trimmed prior to phylogenetic analyses. To elucidate synteny, we used the AlignSliceView program [87], which
provides genome annotation according to DNA-DNA
similarity and selected conserved genes among the
genomes of vertebrates [88] as markers. These marker
genes are defined in Additional file 10.
Alignment of EF-hand regions
According to the motif search server PROSITE [64], single
and multiple EF-hand motifs were found in the extreme
N-terminal region of Nox5, plant Nox, NoxC, and a loop
region between 1st and 2nd TM domains of Duox protein.
After trimming the N-terminal extension from TM1 of
Nox5, plant Nox, NoxC (e.g., residues 1–235 of human

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:109

Nox5α) and the loop between TM1 and TM2 domain of
Duox (e.g., residues 767–1074 of human Duox1), alignment was performed. The alignment is shown in Additional file 8, and amino acid residues corresponding to the
EF-hand motifs are shown in Additional file 2.
Homology modeling
SWISS-MODEL [65,89] was utilized to predict protein
structure of the EF-hand domain of human Nox5 (residues 1–235 of human Nox5α, GenBank™ No. AF353088)
and human Duox1 (residues 767–1074 of human Duox1,
GenBank™ No. NM_017434). Modeling of the N-terminal
region of Nox5 was carried out based on the structures of
calcineurin B subunit isoform 1 (PDB accession No.
1m63F), calcineurin B-like protein 2 (PDB No. 1uhnA),
and calcineurin B-like protein 4 (PDB No. 1v1fA).
Homology modeling of human Duox1 was performed
using calcineurin B subunit isoform 1 (PDB No. 1m63B,
1m63F, and 1auiB). Structures were visualized using the
program DeepView [90].
Estimates of substitution rates of vertebrate Nox/Duox
and regulators
Using the estimated divergence time of species and
number of identical amino acid residues [91], we calculate a substitution rate for each amino acid site per 109
years. Detailed methods to calculate rates and amino acid
residues are described in Additional files 12 and 3, respectively.
Generation of point mutations of human Nox2
Point mutations of Nox2 were introduced by site-directed
mutagenesis, as described previously [20], and detailed
procedures are described in Additional file 12.
Measurement of ROS production by Nox2-transfected
cells
Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were grown
for 24 hrs in 6-well plates and allowed to reach 50% confluency in 2 ml of culture medium. HEK 293 cells, which
endogenously express p22phox, were co-transfected with
vectors encoding Nox2, p47phox, p67phox, and an active
form of the small GTPase Rac1 [Rac1(V12G)] using
FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN).
ROS was measured using luminol chemiluminescence, as
previously described [20], and detailed procedures are
described in Additional file 12.
Immunoprecipitation of Nox2 and p22phox proteins
Transfected cells were lysed for 20 min on ice with lysis
buffer containing 50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM
NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.25% deoxycholate, 1 mM
NaVO4, 10 mM NaF, protease inhibitor mixture (Complete™; Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN), 1 mM

fluorophosphate. The lysates were centrifuged for 5 min at
10,000 × g, and protein G-sepharose (Sigma, St. Louis,
MO) was added to the supernatants to remove non-specific binding proteins. After centrifugation, the supernatants were mixed with anti-Nox2 monoclonal antibody
54.1 [92]. Protein G-sepharose was added to each mixture, and the precipitated protein from 5 × 106 cell equivalents was subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Western
blot analysis.
Western blot analysis
To assess Nox2 expression and ability to bind p22phox,
Western blot analysis was performed using monoclonal
antibodies, 54.1 and 44.1 against human Nox2 and
p22phox, respectively [92,93]. Detailed procedures are
described in Additional file 12.
Statistical analysis
GraphPad Prism (GraphPad software Inc.) was used for ttest statistical analysis to show significant differences of
substitution rates.
