High frequency of SEN virus infection in
thalassemic patients and healthy blood donors in
Iran
Abbas Karimi-Rastehkenari, Majid Bouzari*

Abstract
Background: SEN virus is a blood-borne, circular ssDNA virus and possessing nine genotypes (A to I). Among nine
genotypes, SENV-D and SENV-H genotypes have the strong link with patients with unknown (none-A to E)
hepatitis infections. Infection with blood-borne viruses is the second important cause of death in thalassemic
patients. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of SENV-D and SENV-H genotypes viremia by
performing nested-PCR in 120 and 100 sera from healthy blood donors and thalassemic patients in Guilan
Province, North of Iran respectively. Also, to explicate a possible role of SEN virus in liver disease and established
changes in blood factors, the serum aminotransferases (ALT and AST) and some of the blood factors were
measured.
Results: Frequency of SENV-D, SENV (SENV-H or SENV-D) and co-infection (both SENV-D and SENV-H) viremia was
significantly higher among thalassemic patients than healthy individuals. Frequency of SENV-H viremia was
significantly higher than SENV-D among healthy individuals. In comparison to SENV-D negative patients, the mean
of mean corpuscular hemoglobin was significantly higher in SENV-D positive and co-infection cases (P < 0.05). The
means of AST and ALT were significantly higher in thalassemic patients than healthy blood donors, but there were
not any significant differences in the means of the liver levels between SENV-positive and -negative individuals in
healthy blood donors and thalassemic patients. High nucleotide homology observed among PCR amplicon’s
sequences in healthy blood donors and thalassemic patients.
Conclusions: The high rate of co-infection shows that different genotypes of SENV have no negative effects on
each other. The high frequency of SENV infection among thalassemic patients suggests blood transfusion as main
route of transmission. High frequency of SENV infection in healthy individuals indicates that other routes rather
than blood transfusion also are important. Frequency of 90.8% of SENV infection among healthy blood donors as
well as high nucleotide homology of sequenced amplicons between two groups can probably suggest that
healthy blood donors infected by SENV act partly as a source of SENV transmission to the thalassemic patients. In
conclusion, SENV-D isolate in Guilan Province may be having a pathogenic agent for thalassemic patients.

Background
On July 20, 1999, SEN virus (SENV) was discovered in
the serum of a human immunodeficiency virus type 1
(HIV-1) - infected patient possessing hepatitis with
unknown etiology in Italy [1]. SENV is a blood-borne,
circular ssDNA virus, with approximately 3800 nucleotides in length and about 26 nm in size that is nonenveloped and possesses at least 3 ORFs [2,3]. In the

base of studies on ORF1 sequences SENV has been
classified in a floating genus named Anellovirus [1,2].
Nine different genotypes (A to I) with at least 25%
divergence in nucleotide sequence is reported [2,4].
Among nine genotypes, SENV-D and SENV-H genotypes have comparatively higher frequency in the
patients with unknown (none-A to E) hepatitis and
lower frequency in the sera of healthy blood donors [5].
It has also been shown that this virus is prevalent globally with various prevalence in different geographical
areas [6].

Thalassemia is distributed widely in the Mediterranean
area, Middle East, tropical Africa and the Caribbean [7].
After iron overload, blood-borne infections are the main
cause of death in thalassemic patients [8].
The aim of this study was to determine the frequency
of SENV-D and SENV-H genotypes viremia in thalassemic patients with high risk viremia for blood-borne
viruses and healthy blood donors with low risk viremia
for blood-borne viruses negative for HBs antigen, antiHCV antiboby, anti-HIV antibody in Guilan Province,
North of Iran.
Also, to explicate a possible role of SEN virus in liver
disease and established changes in blood factors, the
serum aminotransferases (ALT and AST) and some of
the blood factors were measured.

Methods
Study design

Iran is located in world thalassemia belt with more than
25000 patients [9]. The Guilan Province lies along the
south coast of Caspian Sea which seems the high rate of
close relative marriage in this area, is the cause of high
frequency of thalassemic patients. The sera were collected from 100 patients with thalassemia major from
pathobiology laboratory of Razi Hospital in Rasht city
from February to June, 2008 and 120 sera of healthy
blood donors from blood transfusion organization of
Guilan Province in September 2007 and stored in -20°C
till tested. The serum samples were negative with ELISA
tests for detection of HBs antigen (Dade Behring, Germany), anti-HCV antibody (Biomerieux, France) and
HIV antigen-antibody (Bio Rad, France). Serum aminotransferases (AST and ALT) were measured by Man kit
(Man laboratory, Iran). The blood factors including red
blood cell count (RBC), white blood cell count (WBC),
platelet count, hemoglobin (Hb), Hematocrit (HTC),
mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin
concentration (MCHC) were measured according to the
standard procedures.
DNA extraction from serum

Serum (220 μl) was mixed with 10 μl of 0.2 M NaCl and
6.5 μl of 0.25% SDS. Twelve μl of 10 mg/ml proteinase
K solution (Roche, Germany) was added and incubated
at 65°C for 2 hours. Protein was precipitated with two
phenol-chloroform and followed by only chloroform
treatment. The cold ethanol (100%) (Merck, Germany)
was used for DNA precipitation and the precipitate was
dissolved in 50 μl of distilled dionized water.

GTT TGT GGT GAG CAG AAC GGA-3’) [4], for first
round for all of the SENV genotypes. Master mix was
made in a 25 μl volume with 0.4 pmol/μl of each primers, 50 mM of KCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, 3 mM MgCl2,
240 μM of each dNTPs, 1 U of Smar Taq DNA polymerase (Cinnagen, Iran) and 3 μl of extracted DNA. Setting was 44 cycles (94°C for 20 seconds, 56°C for 25
seconds and 72°C for 30 seconds for each cycle) with a
final extension time for 5 minutes at 72°C in a thermocycler gradient 5331 (Eppendorf, Germany). One microliter of the products of first-round PCR was used for the
second-round PCR amplification with specific forward
and reverse primers for SENV-D including D-1148F (5’CTA AGC AGC CCT AAC ACT CAT CCA G-3’) and
D-1341R (5’-GCA GTT GAC CGC AAA GTT ACA
AGA G-3’) [4], and for SENV-H including H-1020F (5’TTT GGC TGC ACC TTC TGG TT-3’) and H-1138R
(5’-AGA AAT GAT GGG TGA GTG TTA GGG-3’) [4].
The second-round PCR involved 25 cycles (94°C for 20
seconds, 65°C for 30 seconds and 72°C for 30 seconds)
for both SENV-D and SENV-H.
DNA Sequencing

PCR products of four randomly selected samples from
thalassemic patients and healthy blood donors were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis (1.5%) and DNA
was extracted according to guidelines of the DNA Gel
Extraction Kit #K0513 (Fermentas, EU). The DNAs
were sequenced by Geneservice Company, UK.
Molecular evolutionary analyses

The sequences of the PCR amplicons were aligned using
WU-BLAST2 method. Multiple alignments for the
sequenced amplicons were performed with ClustalW in
MEGA4 (Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis software version 4.1) [10]. A phylogenetic tree constructed
using neighbor-joining method based on partial ORF1
of our sequenced amplicons against sequences obtained
from GenBank with accession numbers of GQ179968
and GQ179969 for SENV-D, and accession numbers of
GQ179972 and GQ452051 for SENV-H, for healthy
individuals and thalassemic patients, respectively. Eight
SEN virus isolates (SENV-A to H), five TTV isolates
and three variants of PMV, SANBAN and TLMV
obtained from GenBank database.
Statistical analyses

Fisher’s exact test, unpaired t-test, one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) and Tukey-Karmer post test were
used for statistical analyses using the GraphPad Instat
software version 3.05 (GraphPad software, USA) and
SPSS software version 15.0 (SPSS Inc., USA).

Detection of SENV DNA

Partial ORF1 gene of SENV-D and SENV-H were amplified by nested-PCR, with forward primer AI-1F (5’-TWC
YCM AAC GAC CAG CTA GAC CT-3’; W = A or T,
Y = C or T, M = A or C) and reverse primer AI-1R (5’-

Results
In the gel electrophoresis expected 195 bp bands for
SENV-D and 119 bp bands for SENV-H were observed
(Figure 1).

As shown in figure 2, the homology was 98% between
sequences of SENV-D1 [GenBank:GQ179968] and
SENV-D2 [GenBank:GQ179969] sequences, likewise, the
homology was 97% between SENV-H1 [GenBank:
GQ179972] and SENV-H2 [GenBank:GQ452051] from
Guilan isolates. Insertion of an adenine nucleotide in
location number 67 was observed in multiple alignments
of SENV-D1 and SENV-D2 sequences (in comparison to
sequence with accession number AX025730).

As shown in figure 3, high genomic homology observed
between our sequences and some of the TTV isolates.
The hematological data of thalassemic patients are
shown in table 1. Apart from three variables of MCH,
WBC and platelet count, the rest were in normal range.
The comparison of age, gender and paraclinical characteristics of the thalassemic patients and healthy blood
donors are shown in table 2. The mean age and frequency
of males were significantly higher in healthy blood donors
(P < 0.0001). Conversely, the means of AST and ALT were
significantly higher in thalassemic patients (P < 0.001).
Comparison of correlation between age groups and
individuals with SENV-positive versus SENV-negative
viremia in healthy blood donors and thalassemic
patients are shown in figure 4. Forty percent of SENVpositive healthy blood donors were under 30 years,
while this was 91% in thalassemic patients which mostly
trends to younger age group.
Frequency of SENV-D, SENV and co-infection viremia
was significantly higher among thalassemic patients than
healthy blood donors. Conversely, there was no significant difference in the frequency of SENV-H between
healthy blood donors and thalassemic patients. Furthermore, frequency of SENV-H viremia was significantly
higher than SENV-D among healthy blood donors, while
this was not significant in thalassemic patients (Table 3).
The comparison of paraclinical characteristics in thalassemic patients and healthy blood donors with and
without SENV infection are shown in tables 4 and 5.
The differences of the white blood cell and platelet
count of the patients were not significant (P > 0.05). In
comparison to SENV-D negative patients the mean of

No significant differences were observed in the mean

SENV-D, SENV-H and co-infection (Table 4).
There were not any significant differences in the mean
of ALT and AST levels between SENV-positive and
-negative individuals in healthy blood donors and thalassemic patients (Tables 4 and 5). It is notable that the
amount of AST and ALT was higher than normal in
twenty-six thalassemic patients.
As shown in Figure 5, SENV-H positive male individuals were significantly higher than SENV-D positive
ones (P < 0.001).

Discussion
Worldwide distribution of SENV is already reported in
healthy blood donors from various geographic areas
such as U.S.A (1.8%) [5], Japan (10-22%) [11], Taiwan
(15%) [12], Thailand (5%) [13], Germany (8-17%) [14],
and at least 13% in Italy [15].

Count

The percentage of SENV infection in healthy blood
donors in this study was 90.8% that is much higher than
previous reports. On the other hand rarely it resembles
to 75% of SENV infection reported in Japan by Yoshida
et al. (2002) [16]. Wide ranges of infection is reported
in intravenous drug users, hemophilic and thalassemic
patients, patients on maintenance hemodialysis, HIV
positive and individuals with liver disease [12,17,18].
Ninety-eight percent of SENV infection in thalassemic
patients is similar to the results obtained in Taiwan
(90%) but in healthy individuals tested it was 90.8% versus 15% in Taiwan [12].
In comparison to other areas studied, the higher frequency of SENV infection in our study could be correlated to the methods used. Higher percentage (90.8%) of
SENV infection in North of Iran, in comparison to
other healthy blood donors in center of Iran (Tehran
Province) (23%) [19], can probably be due to differences
in the methods used and climate conditions including
temperate and humid climate in Guilan Province against
Tehran which is warm and dry. This might affect the
durability of SENV in the environment.

In three separate investigations on interferon and combination therapy of SENV, it is shown that in comparison
to SENV-H, SENV-D is more susceptible to the interferon therapy [20-22]. The lower frequency of SENV-D
observed in this study might be correlated to possible primary interferon response. It is shown that SENV can be
transmitted vertically [23,24]. According to Kao et al.
(2002) [12], and Serin et al. findings (2005) [25], the prevalence of SENV in patients with acute hepatitis A infection is higher than healthy individuals. They proposed
the fecal-oral transmission route for SENV.
Although no significant correlation was observed in
the level of ALT and AST in healthy blood donors and
thalassemic patient with or without SENV infection, 26
thalassemic patients showed unnormal upper levels of
the enzymes (46 IU/L). SENV-D viremia had significant
effects on the MCH of the thalassemic patients (P <
.05). It is already reported that the SENV has an adverse
effect on the survival of the HIV-positive patients (Sagir
et al., 2005) [26]. According to the Figure 4, the effect
of SENV on the survival of thalassemic patients
remained unknown.
High genomic homology observed between our
sequences and some of the TTV isolates may be the
outlook to the evolutionary history of SENV in relation
to TTV as already expressed by Tanaka et al. (2001) [2].
Our results demonstrates that the frequency of SENVH is higher than SENV-D among healthy blood donors
that is consistent with Kao et al. findings (2002) [12].
Considering the reports of the replication of the virus
in liver cells and the failure of manifesting clinical signs

in infections such as cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr,
Hepatitis A and B is common in immunocompetent
individuals [5], the high frequency of SENV in healthy
blood donors with no liver malfunction is a vague result.

Conclusions
The high rate of co-infection shows that different genotypes of the virus have no negative effects on each other.
Higher frequency of SENV infection among thalassemic
patients in comparison to healthy blood donors, except for
nearly identical frequency of SENV-H in healthy blood
donors and thalassemic patients (no significant difference),
indicates the main route of blood trnasfusion. The high
frequency of SENV infection among healthy blood donors
suggests that SENV is also transmitted by different routes
rather than blood transfusion route.
According to the Tanaka et al. findings, some of the
TTV-related isolates can be pathogenic [2]. Considering
to the obtained results, SENV-D isolate in Guilan Province may be pathogenic for thalassemic patients.
Frequency of 90.8% of SENV infection among healthy
blood donors as well as high nucleotide homology of
sequenced amplicons between two groups can probably
suggest that healthy blood donors infected by SENV act
partly as a source of SENV transmission to the thalassemic patients and possibly to other community groups.
