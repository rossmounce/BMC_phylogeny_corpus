The sequence, structure and evolutionary
features of HOTAIR in mammals
Sha He1, Shiping Liu2 and Hao Zhu1*

Abstract
Background: An increasing number of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified recently. Different
from all the others that function in cis to regulate local gene expression, the newly identified HOTAIR is located
between HoxC11 and HoxC12 in the human genome and regulates HoxD expression in multiple tissues. Like the
well-characterised lncRNA Xist, HOTAIR binds to polycomb proteins to methylate histones at multiple HoxD loci,
but unlike Xist, many details of its structure and function, as well as the trans regulation, remain unclear. Moreover,
HOTAIR is involved in the aberrant regulation of gene expression in cancer.
Results: To identify conserved domains in HOTAIR and study the phylogenetic distribution of this lncRNA, we
searched the genomes of 10 mammalian and 3 non-mammalian vertebrates for matches to its 6 exons and the
two conserved domains within the 1800 bp exon6 using Infernal. There was just one high-scoring hit for each
mammal, but many low-scoring hits were found in both mammals and non-mammalian vertebrates. These hits
and their flanking genes in four placental mammals and platypus were examined to determine whether HOTAIR
contained elements shared by other lncRNAs. Several of the hits were within unknown transcripts or ncRNAs, many
were within introns of, or antisense to, protein-coding genes, and conservation of the flanking genes was observed
only between human and chimpanzee. Phylogenetic analysis revealed discrete evolutionary dynamics for
orthologous sequences of HOTAIR exons. Exon1 at the 5’ end and a domain in exon6 near the 3’ end, which
contain domains that bind to multiple proteins, have evolved faster in primates than in other mammals. Structures
were predicted for exon1, two domains of exon6 and the full HOTAIR sequence. The sequence and structure of
two fragments, in exon1 and the domain B of exon6 respectively, were identified to robustly occur in predicted
structures of exon1, domain B of exon6 and the full HOTAIR in mammals.
Conclusions: HOTAIR exists in mammals, has poorly conserved sequences and considerably conserved structures,
and has evolved faster than nearby HoxC genes. Exons of HOTAIR show distinct evolutionary features, and a 239
bp domain in the 1804 bp exon6 is especially conserved. These features, together with the absence of some exons
and sequences in mouse, rat and kangaroo, suggest ab initio generation of HOTAIR in marsupials. Structure
prediction identifies two fragments in the 5’ end exon1 and the 3’ end domain B of exon6, with sequence and
structure invariably occurring in various predicted structures of exon1, the domain B of exon6 and the full HOTAIR.

Background
Consistent with pervasive transcription of the genome
[1,2], many noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) have recently
been discovered. In addition to abundant microRNAs
(reviewed recently in [3,4]), an increasing number of
long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified,
and their crucial functions have been experimentally

confirmed. One key aspect of their functions is tissuespecific genome modification [5,6]. After a cell is fully
differentiated, many genes are specifically silenced by
polycomb proteins and lncRNA-mediated histone methylation rather than by a large army of negative transcriptional factors [7]. Another important aspect is genomic
imprinting [8]. One typical example is the Xist-mediated
inactivation of the whole X chromosome. Because diverse
tissue-specific histone methylation and gene silencing are
performed by only a handful of polycomb proteins [9],
the great enigma of genome modification is how a few

polycomb proteins dynamically and accurately target specific DNA sequences. The discovery of a large amount of
lncRNAs should provide key information.
The most studied case of genome modification is X
inactivation, the silencing of the majority of genes on one
of the X chromosomes in somatic cells to balance gene
copy number during mammalian embryogenesis [10,11].
X inactivation is mediated by the lncRNA Xist [12,13], and
its details have recently been elucidated [14,15]. Regarding
gene silencing and dosage compensation apart from the X
chromosome, several lncRNAs, including HOTAIR, play
essential roles. HOTAIR is co-expressed with the HoxC
genes, interacts with polycomb proteins and functions
in trans to repress HoxD expression [16,17]. In addition to
creating and maintaining spatiotemporally patterned
HoxD expression in multiple tissues during embryogenesis, HOTAIR is also involved in aberrant gene expression
in cancers [18]. The recently discovered functions of Xist,
HOTAIR and other lncRNAs suggest the hypothesis
that numerous lncRNAs should exist to bridge the
limited number of polycomb proteins and the diverse
tissue-specific genome modification. Moreover, many of
them should be evolutionarily conserved.
Tiling arrays are widely used to discover new transcripts,
especially new ncRNAs [19]. Although this method is
convenient and powerful, it can only uncover noncoding
transcripts expressed at particular times in particular
cells. If functional domains of an lncRNA, such as Xist or
HOTAIR, interact with polycomb proteins, they are likely
to be conserved in animals and possibly shared by other
lncRNAs. This pattern of conservation allows computational genome analysis to be used to identify new lncRNAs
and their functional domains, as has been successfully performed for microRNAs [20]. The origin and evolution of
these lncRNAs are also of great importance and interest,
but they have so far hardly been addressed, except for Xist
[21,22]. In this study, we computationally investigated
HOTAIR, the first lncRNA shown to function in trans.
Specifically, we investigated the following questions: (1)
whether HOTAIR exists in all mammals or vertebrates, (2)
whether it has functional domains shared by other known
or potential ncRNAs and whether they are evolutionarily
conserved, (3) the evolutionary features of HOTAIR, and
(4) the possible structures of its functional domains. We
addressed the first question using Infernal, a structurebased RNA homology search program [23], to search the
genomes of 13 vertebrates with exons of HOTAIR. We
addressed the second question by thoroughly evaluating
all of the hits in five animals. We addressed the third question using Paml and EvoNC to analyze sequences orthologous to HOTAIR exons [24,25]. Finally, we addressed the
fourth question using PMmulti and Mfold to predict the
structures of HOTAIR exons and the full HOTAIR
sequences [26,27]. Our results indicated that orthologues

of HOTAIR existed only in mammals and that HOTAIR
has evolved faster than the neighbouring HoxC genes.
Moreover, HOTAIR exons showed discrete evolutionary
dynamics, with some having evolved significantly faster in
primates. Hits of exons as a whole, with high and low
scores, were poorly conserved in animals, except between
closely related species. Many hits fell within introns of, or
were antisense to, protein coding genes. A comparison of
all the predicted 2 dimensional (2D) structures of exon1
and the two conserved domains of exon6 revealed two
invariable fragments in these structures. These results
uncovered multiple facets of HOTAIR and the implications of our results within the wide range of lncRNA evolution and function are discussed.

Methods
Data

The sequence of human HOTAIR was obtained from the
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
database (accession number NR_003716.2). The unmasked
genome data (Ensembl database version 57) of human
(GRCh37.p2, Feb. 2009), chimpanzee (CHIMP2.1, Mar.
2006), rhesus monkey (MMUL 1.0, Feb. 2006), gorilla
(gorGor3, Dec. 2009), cow (Btau_4.0, Oct. 2007), horse
(Equ Cab2, Sep. 2007), dolphin (turTru1, Jul. 2008), dog
(CanFam2.0, May 2006), mouse (NCBI m37, Apr. 2007),
rat (RGSC 3.4, Dec. 2004), platypus (Ornithorhynchus_anatinus-5.0, Dec 2005), chicken (WASHUC2, May 2006),
and zebrafish (Zv9, Apr. 2010) were downloaded from
Ensembl. The sequences corresponding to the rat orthologue of HOTAIR exon6 (consisting of two domains of
HOTAIR exon6 that are conserved in mammals) and the
sequences corresponding to the short exon of human
HoxC12 aligned by Multiz against 22 mammals (human,
chimpanzee, rhesus monkey, gorilla, hedgehog, dog, rat,
mouse, dolphin, elephant, orangutan, baboon, guinea pig,
rabbit, cow, horse, marmoset, kangaroo, armadillo, hyrax,
lemur, and platypus) were obtained from the UCSC Genome Browser database [28].
Obtaining sequences orthologous to the HOTAIR exons

Each of the 6 exons of human HOTAIR was used as a
query to search the genomes of rhesus monkey (rheMac2,
Jan. 2005) and dog (Broad/canFam2, May 2005) in
Ensembl using BLAT [29]. The sequences orthologous
(best hit) to each exon, except exon6, in human, rhesus
monkey and dog (exon2 and exon5 did not have good hits
in dog) were aligned using PMmulti (v1.6, [30]); the
sequences orthologous to exon6 were aligned using
LocARNA (v1.5.4, [31]). With the 6 alignment results, 6
queries (query1 to query6) were built using the cmbuild
and cmcalibrate functions of Infernal (v1.0.1, [23]) and
then used to search the whole genomes of 13 vertebrates
using the cmsearch function of Infernal. Two short

domains of exon6, the ~235 bp domain A and the ~239
bp domain B, were identified in orthologues of exon6 in
all 10 mammals. For the orthologous sequences of the two
domains in human, rhesus monkey and dog, two additional queries (query6a and query6b) were built using the
cmbuild and cmcalibrate functions of Infernal. They were
then used to search the whole genomes of the 13 vertebrates using the cmsearch function of Infernal.
Sequence alignment and structure prediction

Sequences of the 10 mammals that were orthologous to
HOTAIR exon6 were aligned using LocARNA, and
sequences orthologous to all of the other HOTAIR exons
from the 10 mammals were aligned using PMmulti for
phylogenetic analysis. Structures were predicted for the
orthologues of exon1, exon6 domain A and exon6
domain B using PMmulti and Mfold (http://mfold.rna.
albany.edu/?q=mfold, [26,27]), and the predicted structures were displayed using either Mfold or PseudoViewer
(v2.5, [32]). In all cases, default parameters were used
unless otherwise indicated.
Phylogenetic analysis

Using orthologous sequences of HOTAIR exon6 and the
concatenated homogeneous sequences of exon1, exon3,
exon4 and exon5 in the 10 mammals, two phylogenetic
trees were built using the dnadist and kitsch functions of
Phylip (v3.69, [33]). Phylogenetic analysis of the two trees
was performed using the baseml function of Paml (v4.4,
[24]). Fixed parameters included model = 4 (the HKY85
nucleotide substitution model); fix_kappa = 0 and kappa
= 2; fix_alpha = 0 and alpha = 0.5; ncatG = 5, fix_rho = 1
and rho = 0; and cleandata = 0. The parameters kappa
(), alpha (a), local clock and rates of substitution were
estimated under different conditions [34-37]. The evolution of the two conserved domains of exon6 and the short
exon of the neighbouring HoxC12 gene was analyzed in
22 mammals using EvoNC [25].

Results
The sequences of orthologous HOTAIR exons are poorly
conserved

lncRNAs that function in cis, including Xist, AIR and
Kcnq1ot1 [38-41], should evolve closely with their nearby
target genes. HOTAIR is the first lncRNA that has been
found to function in trans to regulate remote gene expression; it is co-expressed with the HoxC genes on chromosome 12 and down-regulates HoxD genes on chromosome
2 in particular tissues in human [16]. Because this regulation occurs between distant genomic loci, whether it exists
in other mammals and non-mammalian vertebrates is of
great interest. We first searched several mammalian genomes in the UCSC and Ensembl databases for matches to
HOTAIR exons using Blastn and BLAT [29]. Close

matches were found in primates but not in other mammals. For example, although the whole sequence of
HOTAIR showed apparent conservation among mammalian orthologues (Figure 1A), individually, the five short
exons (exon1 to exon5) returned few hits from mammalian genomes. Using BLAT, only exons 1, 3 and 4 produced hits in dog and only exon4 produced hits in cow
between HoxC11 and HoxC12, and all of these hits had
poor scores. This finding suggests that if HOTAIR has
orthologues in mammals and other vertebrates, they may
show low sequence conservation. This lack of conservation
is not a surprise because compensatory mutations occur
widely in ncRNAs, and many ncRNAs are conserved in
structure but not in sequence [42,43].
HOTAIR exists only in mammals

Because ncRNAs are characterised by divergent sequences
and conserved structures, to further address the question
of whether HOTAIR exists in mammals and other nonmammalian vertebrates, we used Infernal to search whole
genomes for matches to HOTAIR exons. Infernal is a
local RNA alignment and search tool based on structure
conservation [23]. To make the covariance model necessarily representative, we chose rhesus monkey, a primate
that is more distantly related to human than chimpanzee,
and dog, a mammal that produced several hits in the
BLAT search. First, we identified sequences orthologous
to HOTAIR exons in rhesus monkey and dog; these
sequences were BLAT search hits with high scores and
successive locations between HoxC11 and HoxC12.
Second, we used the sequences of six human HOTAIR
exons and their orthologues in rhesus monkey and dog to
build six queries using the cmbuild and cmcalibrate functions of Infernal. Using these queries, we searched the genomes of 10 placental mammals (human, chimpanzee,
rhesus monkey, gorilla, cow, horse, dog, dolphin, mouse
and rat), the ancestral mammal platypus, and 2 other vertebrates (chicken and zebrafish). Orthologues of the
HOTAIR exons (hits located between HoxC11 and
HoxC12 with high scores) were obtained in all of the placental mammals but not in platypus or the other vertebrates (Figure 1B and Table S1 in Additional file 1).
Notably, each query produced just one high-scoring hit in
the mammalian genomes. These hits were located between
HoxC10/HoxC11 and HoxC12/HoxC13 (HoxC11 or
HoxC12 is absent in some mammals, Figure 1C), and all
of the other hits had low scores. Query2 did not produce
any high-scoring hits in dog, mouse or rat. Moreover,
query6 produced good matches in primates but poor
matches in other mammals, especially in mouse and rat
(Figure 1B, Table S1 in Additional file 1, and Additional
file 2). These results suggest that HOTAIR exists only in
mammals and that, after some evolutionary process, it
became highly conserved in primates.

Figure 1 Sequence conservation of HOTAIR orthologues in mammals. (A) The sequences of HOTAIR orthologues are obviously conserved in
primates but less well conserved in other animals (from UCSC Genome Browser). (B) Orthologues of the HOTAIR exons exist only in mammals.
Exon1, exon3, exon4, exon5 and domain B of exon6 are better conserved than exon2, exon6 and domain A of exon6 (indicated by the darkness
of the boxes). Note that the sequence of the exon6 orthologue is significantly shorter in rat than in other mammals and contains just two
domains. The two boxes under each exon6 are domain A (right side) and domain B (left side), linked by a double line indicating a gap of 130
bp (unmatched part in the Infernal search). The gaps in exon6 of dolphin and dog also indicate unmatched parts in the Infernal search. The
double slashes in the schematic of the dolphin gene indicate long introns. (C) The order and orientation of HOTAIR and its neighbouring HoxC

The downloaded genome data were released in
Ensembl and UCSC at the same time, except that the
platypus data were released in Ensembl in Dec 2005 and
in UCSC in Mar 2007. To check if different assemblies
affect genome search result, we downloaded the platypus genome data from UCSC and repeated the Infernal
search. The obtained results were basically the same as
those obtained from the platypus data in Ensembl.
Fragments of HOTAIR exons are widely found in
mammalian and non-mammalian vertebrate genomes

Except for one high-scoring hit located between HoxC11
and HoxC12, low-scoring hits of short queries (110 bp to
120 bp for query1 to query4 and 64 bp for query5) were
widely obtained in mammalian and other vertebrate genomes. These hits matched a fraction of a HOTAIR exon
and it is unclear whether they contained any functional
element. However, the 1,804 bp query6 produced few lowscoring hits in mammals and other vertebrates. Because
the best hit was less conserved in non-primate mammals
and much shorter in mouse and rat (Figure 1B), we
inferred that the functional domain(s) conserved in mammals should be much shorter than 1,804 bp. Further
searches addressed this issue. The rat orthologue of exon6
was only 622 bp, which was separated in the middle by an
unmatched gap of 130 bp. In mouse, there was a similar

gap of 150 bp at the same position. This gap, therefore,
divided the highly conserved initial 622 bp of query6 into
two domains (Figure 1B). We extracted the two domains
from the human, rhesus monkey and dog genomes and
built query6a and query6b, respectively, as described
above. As expected, searches of the 13 genomes with
query6a and query6b produced more hits, but no new
high-scoring hits were obtained. This result suggests that
the two domains of exon6, which could be the backbone
of HOTAIR, are not shared by other lncRNAs. While
orthologues of domains A and B of exon6 were equally
conserved in primates, orthologues of domain A were
much less conserved in other mammals, especially in
rodents (Figure 1B). Thus, the two domains may undergo
different evolutionary processes or dynamics. Query6a and
query6b also produced some hits with moderate or low
scores. Many of these hits matched to either two specific
fragments in query6a (from approximately 50 bp to
100 bp and from 130 bp to 180 bp) or a specific fragment
in query6b (from approximately 160 bp to 210 bp).
Whether these fragments are essential parts of the two
domains and whether they are functional in vertebrates
are unclear. Using lifeOver in UCSC, we checked whether
hits show syntenic relationships among animals, and
found that the coordinates of many hits, possibly in nonannotated regions, cannot be converted.

Hits of queries show distinct distributions in genomes

Experimental studies have revealed that both HOTAIR
and Xist bind to Ezh2 [44] and that HOTAIR contains
at least two functional domains. The 5’ domain binds
Suz12, a component of polycomb repressive complex 2
(PRC2), whereas the 3’ domain binds LSD1 [17].
Because these proteins, especially the components of
PRC2, are bound by many lncRNAs, we speculated that
not all of the low-scoring hits were functionally irrelevant. A popular method to roughly determine whether a
DNA sequence is functional is to evaluate its conserved
context [45-47]. We examined the hits of all of the
queries in human, chimpanzee, mouse, rat and platypus.
To evaluate the distribution of hits in the genomes and
determine if they were flanked by genes with the same
annotation, for each query and each genome, we
counted the following: (a) the total number of hits, (b)
the number of hits within introns, (c) the number of
hits within novel transcripts or known ncRNAs, (d) the
number of hits in exons of protein coding genes, (e) the
number of hits antisense to a gene, (f) the number of
hits in intergenic regions, and (g) the number of hits in
the 3’UTR or 5’UTR of genes (Table 1). Essentially, no
hits fell within exons of protein coding genes, and a
majority of the hits were intergenic. Nevertheless, a few
observations should be noted. First, no hits were found
within Xist. Second, some hits fell within novel transcripts or known ncRNAs, highlighting the possibility
that there could be functional elements in these transcripts or ncRNAs. Third, many hits fell within introns
of protein coding genes. Finally, although query4 was
the same length as query1, query2 and query3 and
query5 was even shorter, in all mammals, query4 and
query5 produced significantly fewer hits. This high variance cannot be accounted for simply by random hits.
One potential explanation is that exon1, exon2 and
exon3 may contain functional elements that are shared
by other ncRNAs and/or distributed more widely.
Flanking genes in different animals often reflect the
evolutionary conservation of a DNA sequence. We specifically examined the flanking genes of each hit of query1,
query6a and query6b. Query1 had 32 hits flanked by the
same genes in human and chimpanzee but just 1 hit
flanked by the same gene in mouse and rat. Moreover,
no hit of query1 was flanked by the same genes in all
four mammals. Query6a had 14 hits flanked by the same
genes in human and chimpanzee, but none in mouse and
rat. Consistent with high conservation, query6b had 21
hits flanked by the same genes in human and chimpanzee
but none in mouse and rat. As mouse and rat have an
evolutionary distance (divergence time) at least 4 times
that of human and chimpanzee [37], these results indicate that hits of these queries have moderately conserved
distributions in mammalian genomes.

Orthologous sequences of HOTAIR exons show different
evolutionary dynamics

Most protein coding genes are produced by gene duplication followed by neofunctionalisation and/or subfunctionalisation. Because an increasing number of ncRNAs
have been identified, the mechanisms through which
these ncRNAs form and evolve are of great interest.
HOTAIR comprises five short and one long exon.
Although its origin remains obscure, some exons are
apparently less conserved than others. We therefore analyzed the molecular evolution of the HOTAIR exons.
Using the concatenated sequences orthologues to exon1,
exon3, exon4 and exon5 and the sequences orthologous

He et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:102
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/102

to exon6, we built two phylogenetic trees using Phylip
[33] (Figure 2). Assuming that nucleotide substitutions
followed the HKY85 model [34] and rates of nucleotide
substitutions varied among sites, we analyzed sequences
of HOTAIR exons using Paml. We first compared the
two trees under multiple conditions. Under all of the
conditions examined, nearly the same log-likelihood
(lnL) and other parameters were obtained for the two
trees. For example, if nucleotide substitution rates were
variable among sites and the molecular clock was allowed
to vary from branch to branch, tree A produced a slightly
larger log-likelihood (-759.53 vs. -774.33) for exon1 but
slightly smaller log-likelihoods for the other exons
(-13949.07 vs. -13940.2 as the summed values). Because
exon6 is the main body of HOTAIR, we then chose tree
B to perform evolutionary analysis. We examined
whether nucleotide substitution rates varied among sites
in the exons using the log-likelihood ratio test, a statistical test for comparing two models [35]. The smallest
2ΔlnL = 2((-11774.82)-(-11791.17)) = 32.7 was obtained
from orthologous sequences of exon6 (-11774.82 for the
HKY85+gamma model and -11791.17 for the HKY85
model). The probability distribution of the test can be
approximated by a chi-square distribution with one
2
degree of freedom, with χ1, 0.5% = 7.88, supporting the
model of disparate nucleotide substitution rates. Further

analysis revealed that the sequences of the orthologues of
different exons had different transition/transversion rate
ratio (), different shape parameter of the gamma distribution (a), and different nucleotide substitution rates
between clades (Table 2). Because exon1, exon2 and
exon6 had significant a>1, most sites in these exons
should have moderate substitution rates, but a few sites
had fast or slow rates of substitution. Because exons 3, 4
and 5 all had a < 1, most sites in these exons should have
low substitution rates. In addition, the values of a in
exon6 (a >1 for domain A and a < 1 for domain B) indicated that domain B was more conserved than domain A,
which agrees with the Infernal results in which the scores
of the hits to query6a in non-primate mammals were
lower than the scores of hits to query6b (Figure 1B and
Table S1 in Additional file 1). These results indicate
asynchronous evolution of orthologous sequences of
HOTAIR exons in mammals.
To examine HOTAIR evolution in more detail, we also
investigated whether nucleotide substitution rates varied
among clades. First, we performed a log-likelihood ratio
test to determine whether the HKY85 model would fit
the data better with or without a global clock. The smallest 2ΔlnL = 2((-11774.82)-(-11814.58)) = 79.52, with =
21.96 (this log-likelihood ratio test has eight degrees of
freedom), was obtained from orthologous sequences of

To obtain stable local clock estimations, only two local clocks were specified in each run (see Figure 2B) and the remaining species had rate r0 = 1. *: a large

exon6 (-11774.82 for the HKY85+gamma model without
a global clock and -11814.58 for the HKY85+gamma
model with a global clock). This result clearly disproved
the global clock hypothesis. Then, we set two local clocks
to investigate whether the exons evolved at different rates
in mammals (Figure 2B). For exon1, exon2, exon4 and
domain B of exon6, the substitution rates in primates
were significantly higher than those in the other group of
mammals; for exon3, exon5 and domain A of exon6, the
substitution rates were not much different between the
two groups (Table 2). As the 5’ domain of HOTAIR has
been found to bind to Suz12 and the 3’ domain to LSD1
[17], whether the accelerated evolution of exon1, exon2
and domain B of exon6 in primates has relationship with
their protein binding function awaits further investigation. In addition, the frequencies of nucleotide substitutions (πA, πT, πC, πG) varied significantly for different
branches and at different nodes. Taken together, these
results suggest that HOTAIR may be a relatively new
gene, with some exons having recently undergone an
accelerated evolution.
HOTAIR evolves faster than its neighbouring HoxC genes
in mammals

HoxC genes exist widely in vertebrates; HOTAIR, in contrast, exists only in mammals. It was therefore interesting
to determine whether HOTAIR evolved faster than the
neighbouring HoxC genes. Because HoxC11 is absent in
rat, dolphin and platypus and the long exon of human
HoxC12 is absent in some mammals, we compared the
evolution of the short exon of HoxC12 with the evolution
of the main part of exon6 of HOTAIR in 22 mammals (see
Data and Methods). Sequences from the UCSC database
that were aligned by Multiz and EvoNC, a program for
detecting selection in noncoding regions of nucleotide
sequences, were used [25]. For protein coding sequences,
the rate of nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution was
used to detect selection pressure and positive/negative
selection. To apply such detection to noncoding sequences,
the rate of substitution relative to the rate of synonymous

substitution in coding sequences can be modelled by the
parameter δ. δ = 1 indicates that a site in a noncoding
sequence evolved neutrally, whereas δ < 1 and δ > 1 suggest positive and negative selection, respectively [25]. We
concatenated the aligned orthologous region of HOTAIR
and the aligned short exon of HoxC12 and analyzed the
concatenated sequences. The results are shown in Table 3.
The log-likelihood test clearly rejected the null hypothesis
that the HOTAIR region evolved neutrally, and the value
of 4.1694 found for δ2 in the three-category case strongly
suggested that the HOTAIR region was under positive
selection and evolved faster than HoxC12. The exact driving force behind this positive selection remains to be
elucidated.
Structure prediction reveals two domains with invariable
sequences and structures

As many lncRNAs, including Xist and HOTAIR, can
interact with both polycomb proteins and DNA sequences,
it is important to identify the sequences and structures of
their functional domains [48]. An lncRNA may have a
conserved backbone and/or functional domains but have
varied structure in different species, making the determination of the accurate structure of the full lncRNA difficult and sometimes unnecessary. So, instead of attempting
to predict the structure of the full HOTAIR, we focused
on determining the sequence and structure of possible
functional domains in its exons. Because the orthologous
sequences of each HOTAIR exon were obtained using
structure-based genome searches, they had the same
structures as the queries built by PMmulti and Infernal.
Because each query produced only one high-scoring hit
located between HoxC11 and HoxC12, the structures of
queries determined by PMmulti and Infernal should be
reasonable. To facilitate the determination of the sequence
and structure of possible functional domains, two constraints were used. First, in the consensus structure of
each query determined by PMmulti and used by Infernal,
functional domains should be occupied by sequences conserved in the 10 mammals. Second, in all of the possible

structures of an exon’s orthologue in a mammal predicted
by other tools, functional domains should have invariant
sequences and structures.
Because a 5’ domain of HOTAIR binds PRC2 [17], we
assumed the 5’ domain should be conserved in mammals and query2 did not produce any high-scoring hits
in dog, mouse or rat, we tried to identify the functional
domain in predicted structures of exon1. PseudoViewer
shows that the consensus structure for exon1 consists of
one big arc and three substructures (Figure 3A and
Figure S1 in Additional file 1). The bottom substructure
contains three small loops in some mammals, but is a
large loop in cow, dolphin, mouse and rat; therefore it is
unlikely to be a functional domain. The middle substructure contains three tiny loops and the top substructure contains a hairpin at its end in all animals, which
indicates that they could be or contain the functional
domain. To obtain more results to aid in the determination, Mfold was used to predict structures of exon1’s
orthologous sequence in each mammal [27]. Mfold predicted 9 structures in human, 9 in chimpanzee, 14 in
rhesus monkey, 3 in gorilla, 2 in cow, 3 in dog, 2 in dolphin, 42 in horse, 1 in mouse and 3 in rat (Figure S2 in
Additional file 1). Notably, the hairpin was found at the
same position in 7 of the 9 predicted structures in
human, and in the other 2 cases its sequence was
embedded within neighbouring sequences (Figure 3BCD
and Figure S2 in Additional file 1). Similar results were
obtained from other animals. These Mfold predicted
structures provide valuable and complementary information for determining the possible position and structure
of the functional domain in exon1.
According to an experimental study, a 3’ domain of
HOTAIR, located from approximately 1500 bp to 2146
bp, binds LSD1 [17]. However, Infernal produced short
sequences for the exon6 orthologues in mouse and rat
(1,500 bp and 622 bp, respectively), which did not include
the 3’ end reported in the human sequence. Postulating
that the 3’ functional domain should be conserved in
mammals and might not be as long as 622 bp, we analyzed the structures of domain A (560 bp to 800 bp) and
domain B (950 bp to 1,190 bp) of exon6 in the 10 mammals. As stated previously, the structure determined by
PMmulti and used by Infernal was compared with all of
the structures predicted by Mfold. We first examined
domain B. Mfold predicted 3 structures for domain B in
human, 6 in chimpanzee, 6 in rhesus monkey, 8 in

gorilla, 2 in cow, 13 in dog, 5 in dolphin, 7 in horse, 9 in
mouse and 7 in rat. We first checked those in human and
rat, the two mammals with the greatest evolutionary distance, and found that a conserved GC-rich paired fragment existed in structures predicted for all 10 mammals
and that it closely matched the marked part (the circled
area) in the structure predicted by PMmulti (Figure 4A
and Figure S3B in Additional file 1). We then examined
all 66 structures of domain B predicted by Mfold for the
10 mammals and found that in 4 cases, the GC-rich
paired fragment had the structure shown in Figure 4A
(human), in 39 cases it had the structure shown in Figure
4B (chimpanzee), in 11 cases it had the structure shown
in Figure 4C (cow), and in 7 cases it had the structure
shown in Figure 4D (dog). Compared with the predicted
functional domain in exon1, this specific structure
existed more obviously in domain B. In contrast, domain
A of exon6 was much less conserved (Figure 1B and
Table S1 in Additional file 1) and was GC poor (data not
shown), without a clear consensus substructure in structures predicted using Mfold.
The sequence and structure of the two domains occur
nearly invariably in structures of full HOTAIR

Although focusing on the sequence and structure of conserved (and potentially functional) domains is reasonable,
the structure of a piece of RNA can be very different
from that when it is embedded by long sequences. To
validate the sequence and structure of the two conserved
fragments in exon1 and domain B of exon6, we predicted
structures of the full HOTAIR in all the mammals. The
predicted sequence and structure of the fragment in
exon1 occurs in many structures of full HOTAIR;
remarkably, the predicted sequence and structure of the
fragment in domain B of exon6 occurs in most structures
of full HOTAIR. For example, Mfold produced 29 and 37
structures for human and rat full HOTAIR respectively.
In humans, the predicted structure of the fragment in
exon1 occurs in 8 of 29 full HOTAIR structures, and the
predicted structure of the fragment in domain B of exon6
occurs in 20 of 29 full HOTAIR structures. In rats, the
predicted structure of the fragment in exon1 occurs in 33
of 37 full HOTAIR structures, and the predicted structure of the fragment in domain B of exon6 occurs in 31
of 37 full HOTAIR structures (Additional file 3). Given
the length of HOTAIR and the number of its predicted
structures, these results strongly support the predicted
functional fragment in domain B of exon6. The next step
should be to experimentally validate these structures and
their functions.

Discussion
Except for Xist, the origin, evolution, structure and phylogenetic distribution of lncRNAs have barely been

Page 9 of 14

investigated. Because BLAT failed to find orthologous
sequences of HOTAIR exons in mammals, some exons
are missing in some mammals and gaps exist in many
mammals in the sequences of exon orthologues identified
using the RNA homology search software Infernal,
HOTAIR is likely to have conserved structures but divergent sequences. This feature should be common to
lncRNAs rather than being unique to HOTAIR [N1,N2].
For example, XIST contains both rapid evolving
sequences and highly conserved domains [49]. What constrains lncRNAs evolution is poorly understood. As they
interact with both the PRC2 complex and specific DNA
sequences, co-evolution with specific DNA sequences
should be an important aspect. Compared with lncRNAs
functioning in cis to regulate local genes, the evolutionary
constraints of HOTAIR that function in tran is more
intriguing. Because the Infernal search produced just one
high-scoring hit in each placental mammal, where this
was located between HoxC11 and HoxC12, it can be
inferred that HOTAIR exists in eutherians and that it is
younger than its neighbouring Hox genes. How HOTAIR
originated remains unclear. Phylogenetic analysis
revealed that within the relatively young gene, HOTAIR
exons had asynchronous evolutionary dynamics and
some exons had undergone an accelerated evolutionary
process in primates. These results indicate positive selection during HOTAIR’s evolution. Accelerated evolution
is also supported by the comparison between HOTAIR
exon6 and the short exon of HoxC12, which clearly
showed that the HOTAIR exon evolved significantly faster than the HoxC12 exon. Structure prediction for the
orthologous sequences in 10 mammals showed two fragments in exon1 and domain B of exon6 with invariant
base pairing and 2D structure (Figure 3 and Figure 4).
These fragments, located at the 5’ end and close to the 3’
end of HOTAIR, respectively, could be functional
domains of HOTAIR.
One query based on a HOTAIR exon produced only
one high-scoring hit in the genome of each mammal,
where this was located between HoxC11 and HoxC12,
the location of HOTAIR in the human genome. However, many low-scoring hits were found in other places in
mammalian and other vertebrate genomes. Because a
considerable number of lncRNAs are believed to interact
with polycomb proteins to conduct tissue-specific genome modification, we anticipated, for several reasons,
that the Infernal search would identify some consensus
sequences for polycomb protein binding in genomes, like
the TATA box in promoters and the homeobox in Hox
genes, that are shared by other lncRNAs. First, the four
families of Hox genes have demonstrated complex cross
regulation and compensation during embryogenesis
[50,51], which suggests that multiple HOTAIR-like
lncRNAs may be needed to mediate negative feedback

and dosage balances among Hox genes. Second, Hox
genes participate in diverse cell fate determination and
reprogramming [52,53], which suggests that Hox-related
lncRNAs may mediate genome modification at multiple
loci. Third, a recent study revealed that both HOTAIR
and the RepA ncRNA within Xist bind to the PRC2 complex [44], although it is unclear whether the binding
domains are similar. Moreover, because multiple important proteins, such as Nanog, Oct4 and Sox2, also interact with Xist [54], the scope of lncRNA functions should
be large. These facts make it theoretically plausible that
there should be many lncRNAs that share the same or
similar functional domains with HOTAIR. However,
except for one high-scoring hit, no hits with moderate
scores were obtained. To what extent lncRNAs maintain
conserved function with evolved sequences is poorly
understood. It is unlikely that all of the low-scoring hits
are random hits, because query4 and query5, which are
equal to and shorter than query1, produced much fewer
hits. In addition, some low-scoring hits fell within novel
transcripts and unknown ncRNAs, and many were within
introns of or antisense to protein coding genes (Table 1),
which is consistent with the findings that many lncRNAs
(like AIR and Kcnq1ot1) are antisense to protein coding
genes [11,55]. Global transcriptome analysis has revealed
that a large proportion of the genome can produce transcripts from both strands [2] and antisense transcription
is believed to have roles in gene regulation. Meanwhile,
more than 55,000 completely intronic noncoding RNAs
have been found to be transcribed from the introns of
74% of all unique RefSeq genes, which indicates that
RNAs transcribed from intronic regions of genes have
distinct regulatory roles and are involved in a number of
processes [56,57]. To carefully compare all hits with
cDNA libraries should produce more information.
The evolution of lncRNA sequences, including those
within the vertebrate Hox clusters, has been examined
recently. These studies reveal that the evolution of many
lncRNAs is not consistent with the neutral evolution
model, and purifying selection has acted on their promoters and some conserved sites [58,59]. However,
except for Xist [21,22], the evolution of specific ncRNA
genes has not been examined. Compared with ancestral
regions and general intergenic sequences, lncRNA
sequences have been shown to exhibit lower rates of
nucleotide substitution, insertion, and deletion, which
can be interpreted to indicate that they have undergone
purifying selection [58]. Our analysis of orthologues of
HOTAIR in 10 mammals covering multiple eutherian
orders suggests that HOTAIR exons have discrete evolutionary dynamics, and that some exons evolved significantly faster in primates than in non-primate mammals.
The analysis of orthologous sequences of HOTAIR

Page 11 of 14

exon6 and a HoxC12 exon in 22 mammals indicates
that HOTAIR may have evolved faster than its neighbouring HoxC genes. These results suggest that
HOTAIR may have undergone an accelerated evolution
in eutherians under positive selection. In general, a gene
with important function should evolve slowly due to
strong functional constraints; however the opposite is
often true when the gene is young (in an active neofunctionalisation or subfunctionalisation stage). For
example, young proteins experience more variable selection pressures than established proteins [60]. That
HOTAIR is not found in non-mammalian vertebrates
and that it has evolved faster than nearby HoxC genes
both indicate that it is a young gene that formed after
the two rounds of whole genome duplication. Given
that most lncRNAs, including Xist, have so far only
been found in mammals, it is interesting to ask when
and why these lncRNAs emerge in higher vertebrates to
mediate genome modification. Because HOTAIR exists
in mammals, it evolves faster than HoxC12, and its
exons have discrete evolutionary dynamics, we postulate
that HOTAIR may have formed ab initio, possibly via
the activity of transposons. HOTAIR is involved in the
PRC2-mediated silencing of chromatin at HoxD loci,
but its main effect in the regulation of Hox gene expression may be dosage compensation. In this sense it is
similar to Xist. The lower effectiveness of dosage compensation in birds than in mammals and the lack of
general dosage compensation for sex-linked genes in
chickens [61,62] may explain why HOTAIR, like Xist, is
found only in eutherians.
In this study, the structures of HOTAIR exons were
predicted using two programs. Without any experimental data for structure prediction [48], we adopted a comparative computational approach to predict the
sequence and structure of conserved functional domains
of HOTAIR rather than the structure of the full
HOTAIR sequence in mammals. PMmulti and Mfold
were used to predict multiple potential structures for
orthologues of each exon. For example, for exon1,
Mfold predicted 9 structures in human, 9 in chimpanzee, 14 in rhesus monkey, 3 in gorilla, 2 in cow, 3 in
dog, 2 in dolphin, 42 in horse, 1 in mouse and 3 in rat.
If invariant sequence base pairing and 2D structure are
found in all of the structures predicted using Mfold and
in the consensus structure predicted using PMmulti, it
is highly likely that the sequence and structure represents a functional domain. Because to produce experimental data to determine structures of lncRNAs is
sophisticated and time-consuming, the results of our
structure prediction should be valuable for further
experimental studies of HOTAIR, and the methods
should be applicable to studies of other lncRNAs.

Conclusions
The lncRNA HOTAIR has poorly conserved sequences
and considerably conserved structures in 11 examined
mammals (10 eutherians and 1 marsupial). It shows distinct evolutionary features and has evolved faster than
nearby HoxC genes. Given that exons 1-5 are very short,
exon1 and a domain of exon6 (1804 bp) are absent in
kangaroo, and exon2 is absent in mouse, rat and kangaroo, a highly conserved 239 bp domain in exon6, initially appeared in kangaroo, should be the backbone of
HOTAIR. These findings suggest the ab initio generation
of HOTAIR in marsupials. Structure prediction identifies
two fragments, in the 5’ end exon1 and the 3’ end domain
B of exon6 respectively, with their sequence and structure invariably occurring in various predicted structures
of exon1, the domain B of exon6 and the full HOTAIR.
These are supported by experimental findings. To compare the origin and evolutionary features of HOTAIR
with Xist suggests that many lncRNAs, may first form in
marsupials and then have undergone a rapid evolution in
eutherians. An interesting question is whether their
origin and evolution is intrinsically associated.
Note added in proof
During the review of the manuscript, we downloaded,
searched and analyzed opossum and kangaroo genome
data (Ensembl released the improved assemblies of kangaroo (dipOrd1.60) and opossum (BROADO5.57) in Oct
2010). Whole genome search of opossum did not produce
high-scoring hits. Searching the kangaroo genome with
query3, query4, query5 and query6 each produced a highscoring hit, which have successive addresses in GeneScaffold_2370 (Figure 1B and Additional file 2). Query6’s hit
matches query6 from 33 bp to 655 bp, exactly as that in
rat. What is interesting is that exon1 and exon2 were
absent, domain B of exon6 produced a high-scoring hit,
and domain A of exon6 was not identified. These results,
together with the phylogenetic analysis, lead to two suggestions. First, HOTAIR, like other lncRNAs, first formed
in some marsupials and underwent a rapid evolution in
eutherians. Second, domain B of exon6 may be the backbone of HOTAIR, because it is the only relatively long
piece conserved in marsupial and eutherians.
Monotremes have multiple X chromosomes but it is
not clear whether they undergo dosage compensation;
marsupials show dosage compensation but they lack Xist
[63]. It is found that female marsupials may use an ancestral dosage compensation mechanism that differs from,
but share common properties with, the Xist based in
eutherians [64,65]. Since protein-coding genes that flank
the eutherian XIC are well-conserved in M. domestica
and vertebrates and there is a surprising break in synteny
with eutherian mammals and other vertebrates, it is

Page 12 of 14

suggested that during the evolution of the marsupial X
chromosome, one or more rearrangements broke up an
otherwise evolutionarily conserved block of vertebrate
genes [66]. The situation of HOTAIR, which is flanked
by HoxC11 and HoxC12, not found in vertebrates and
initially occurs in marsupials as revealed in this study,
seems quite similar to Xist. This raises the interesting
question of whether HOTAIR and Xist, and possibly also
some other lncRNAs, have undergone the same evolutionary process.
