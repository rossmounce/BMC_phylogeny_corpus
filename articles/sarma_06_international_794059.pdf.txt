Abstract
The XI International Rotifer Symposium was held during 11–18 March, 2006 at the National
Autonomous University of Mexico Campus Iztacala located at the North Mexico City (Mexico).
These triennial international meetings, first organized in Austria by Late Ruttner-Kolisko in
September 1976, are gradually becoming the focal point of discussion and collaboration from
rotifer workers across the world. The present XI symposium was attended by 125 participants
from 20 nations. During this meeting, different themes of rotifer research from morphology to
molecular biology were considered. In addition, there were four invited lectures and four
workshops covering different themes of the symposium. During the last 30 years, rotifer research
has witnessed gradual shift from the conventional morphological taxonomy to molecular and
evolutionary systematics. While the basic rotifer ecological studies continue today, applied areas
such as ecotoxicology and aquaculture have taken key roles in the recent meetings. The
international rotifer meetings provide ample opportunities not only for exchange of ideas and
recent research, but also for material and in establishing inter-personal relationships. Over the last
30 years, the number of participants attending the rotifer meetings has increased.

Background
Rotifers are small (<2 mm) and beautiful invertebrates,
harmless to mankind. Their use as model organisms in
teaching courses of biology, as a scandalous group in evolutionary ecology, as larval diet in aquaculture and as sensitive indicators of water quality has been widely
recognized. Moreover, due to their high metabolic rates,
they regenerate nutrients trapped in phytoplankton and
detritus on which they feed [1]. There are about 2150
rotifer species globally. The fact that new species are currently discovered from different parts of the world suggests that the taxonomic studies on rotifers are far from
complete in spite of its 300 year old history [2,3].

The tradition of triennial rotifer symposia was first initiated by the late Ruttner- Kolisko of Austria. This has had a
stimulatory influence on rotifer research. So far 10 countries have hosted these symposia (Austria (twice), Belgium, Italy, Poland, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom,
USA and Thailand and Mexico). Unlike many other conferences, rotifer symposia are distinguished by keeping a
permanent record of presentations through formal publication in the form of proceedings in a prestigious scientific journal. Though the proceedings of the first rotifer
meeting appeared in Archiv für Hydrobiologie, the subsequent proceedings have taken an honourable place in
Hydrobiologia. The proceedings of the XI Rotifer meeting
are also expected to appear in the same journal (Table 1).

Results and discussion
The XI international rotifer symposium was held during
11–18 March, 2006 at the National Autonomous University of Mexico Campus Iztacala located at the North Mexico City (Mexico). The abstracts of the meeting are
available on the official website [4]. A total of 125 participants from 20 nations participated during this meeting
(Figure 1). At the symposium five major areas were considered: 1. morphology, taxonomy, zoogeography and
field ecology, 2. feeding, trophic interactions, behaviour,
autecology and population ecology, 3. molecular biology,
evolution, genetics and biochemistry, 4. aquaculture and
mass production and 5. ecotoxicology and indicator species. In addition there were four invited lectures and four
workshops covering different themes of the symposium.
Workshops at the XI Rotifer Symposium were aimed at
examining difficulties and/or problems and to uncover
novel approaches that show promise in resolving these
issues.
While many symposia are conducted at hotels, mainly
due to logistic convenience, the present one was held in a
university. In this way, several students and young faculty
members were in fact stimulated by the presence of a great
number of renowned researchers. This is evident from a
report appeared recently in the University Gazette [5]. The
Rotifera XI distinguished from all other previous ones in
the sense that symposium took full advantage of the internet revolution. No formal invitation letters or the publicity material were printed on paper. All such information
had been stored and mailed electronically. Two rotifer
workers (Robert Wallace and Terry Snell) had attended all
the 11 symposia without missing even a single meeting
and thus received a university medal "Dedicated Rotifer
Researcher". Five previous organizers of the rotifer meeting (HJ Dumont, MR Miracle, J Ejsmont-Karabin, LO
Sanoamuang and A Herzig), who were present during

Rotifera XI, also received the university medals for passing
on the torch of successful rotifer symposium.
Rotifer symposia have a long and honourable tradition of
a mid-conference excursion to some well known freshwater bodies. During the Rotifera XI the participants had an
opportunity to visit a UNESCO world heritage site, the
Xochimilco Lake.
Emphasis on different themes
Presentations spanned several themes among which
trophic interactions and laboratory experiments on the
population and community ecology of rotifers constituted 45% of the total presentations (Table 2). The lowest
input was on aquacultural applications of rotifers. In the
section on morphology and taxonomy, brilliant electron
microscopic techniques for preparing rotifer specimens
were shown by Wilko Ahlrichs. G Melone and his colleagues presented information on water loss and the associated morphological changes during desiccation in
bdelloids. They believe that the reduced body size of a
desiccated bdelloid rotifer is primarily due to elimination
of body cavities. Data on the zoogeographical distribution
of rotifers from different continents were also presented
by some participants. Scott Mills discussed the future of
rotifer taxonomy mainly based on the euryhaline Brachionus plicatilis complex. New species descriptions have
been largely restricted to Brachionus (from Mexico) and
Cephalodella (North-West Germany) and Dicranophorus
(Belgium). Based on an ongoing project, Elizabeth Walsh
and her colleagues (in USA and the counterpart in Mexico) presented some preliminary data on rotifer diversity
in the Chihuahua desert springs.

The section on the trophic interactions and population
ecology considered many diverse aspects. The most interesting from the point of salinity stress and the rotifer ecology was the invited talk by Peter Starkweather. Though

many rotifer species are restricted to freshwaters, some do
inhabit hypersaline desert endorheic water bodies. Salinity has strong effects on both density and diversity of rotifers. S. Nandini and her colleagues presented data on
rotifer diversity and abundance through seasons and at
different depths from one of largest drinking water reservoirs in Mexico (Valle de Bravo).
The importance of morphological and molecular data on
the rotifer phylogeny was considered during this symposium. This was supplemented by the workshop on DNA
barcodes by C.W. Birky Jr. Cross mating experiments

within the different geographical populations appear to
show the existence of a species complex in the rotifer
Ephiphanes senta. The limited molecular work on Plationus
did not consider other biological characteristics such as
male or resting egg morphology, demography or cross
mating or mate-recognition factors for deriving phylogenetic relationship within Brachionidae. Hence its taxonomic status still remains unresolved. Mark Welch
presented a nice account on phylogenetics and ribosomal
gene evolution in the bdelloid rotifers, a group where
males are totally absent.

The aquacultural application of rotifers is not steadily
increasing with the same pace as shrimp or fish production, where they are widely used as live food. Some reasons seem to be: a) mass culture techniques of rotifers are
nearly stabilized on a global scale [6] and possibly, since
Artemia cysts are relatively easy to procure, marine aquaculture largely employs these anostracans. Nevertheless,
attempts to improve the nutritional quality of rotifers
were presented during this symposium.
Ecotoxicological aspects of rotifers were represented by as
many as seven different groups. Most of these contributions during this symposium considered population level
effects of different toxic substances on monogonont rotifers. Field-based studies were poorly represented. The
workshop on ecotoxicology co-chaired by Terry Snell and
Célia Joaquim-Justo invited lively discussion from the
participants. There is a great practical application of rotifers in ecotoxicological evaluations and developing safety
standards for water quality.

Conclusion
Over the last 30 years, the number of participants attending the rotifer meetings is on the rise. The number of
countries representing these events has stabilized to
around 20. During the Rotifera XI, almost every aspect of
rotifer research – both basic and applied was discussed.
