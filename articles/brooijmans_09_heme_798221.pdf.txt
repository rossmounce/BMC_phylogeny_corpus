Abstract
Background: For some lactic acid bacteria higher biomass production as a result of aerobic
respiration has been reported upon supplementation with heme and menaquinone. In this report,
we have studied a large number of species among lactic acid bacteria for the existence of this trait.
Results: Heme- (and menaquinone) stimulated aerobic growth was observed for several species
and genera of lactic acid bacteria. These include Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus,
Lactobacilllus brevis, Lactobacillus paralimentarius, Streptococcus entericus and Lactococcus garviae. The
increased biomass production without further acidification, which are respiration associated traits,
are suitable for high-throughput screening as demonstrated by the screening of 8000 Lactococcus
lactis insertion mutants. Respiration-negative insertion-mutants were found with noxA, bd-type
cytochrome and menaquinol biosynthesis gene-disruptions. Phenotypic screening and in silico
genome analysis suggest that respiration can be considered characteristic for certain species.
Conclusion: We propose that the cyd-genes were present in the common ancestor of lactic acid
bacteria, and that multiple gene-loss events best explains the observed distribution of these genes
among the species.

Background
Lactic acid bacteria are extensively used for the production
of a diverse range of fermented foods with improved
shelf-life, taste and nutritional properties [1-3]. The consumption of certain strains of lactic acid bacteria, called
probiotics, may even provide health benefits by preventing or reducing disease symptoms [4,5]. Lactic acid bacteria are typically cultivated in (micro)anaerobic food-

environments and have been (historically) classified as
non-respiring, facultative anaerobes.
Since the early seventies, however, observations were
made that heme could induce behavior that resembles
respiration in several lactic acid bacteria that included Lactococcus lactis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus species
and Leuconostoc mesenteriodes. Heme stimulated the aeroPage 1 of 11

bic growth of these species and/or induced cytochrome
formation [6-9]. Recent experimental work provided conclusive evidence for actual respiration in Lactococcus lactis.
Typically, respiratory chains consist of dehydrogenases, a
membrane integral electron shuttle, such as quinones,
and cytochromes and can generate a proton motive force.
Menaquinone production by Lactococcus lactis strains has
been observed, as well as, genes found that encode
menaquinone biosynthesis in the sequenced genomes
[10-12]. Moreover, the Lactococcus lactis respiratory chain
contains a heme-dependent bd-type cytochrome, encoded
by the cydABCD operon that is capable of generating a
proton motive force [13,14].
Heme-induced respiration dramatically alters the phenotype
of Lactococcus lactis, as it not only improves growth-efficiency
but also robustness (improved stress resistance) [15,16]. The
industrial relevance of these respiration-associated traits are
made apparent by existing industrial and patent applications, for improved production of starter cultures [17,18].
Over the years several additional lactic acid bacteria were
identified with a similar response to heme as Lactococcus
lactis. A more structured investigation of the distribution
of this trait among lactic acid bacteria, however, has not
been conducted [19,20]. In this study, we aim to find
more species of lactic acid bacteria that are potential respirators. As it also remains unclear whether respiration
can be considered a species-specific trait, for a number of
species multiple strains are examined. Furthermore, with
the availability of numerous sequenced genomes, we can
use in silico data as well to find potential respirators
among the lactic acid bacteria.

Methods
Bacterial strains and growth conditions
For a full list of Lactococcus lactis and Lactobacillus
plantarum strains used in this study see Table 1 and Addi-

tional File 1. The names of lactic acid bacteria, whose
heme induced phenotypes are derived from other literature sources, are not included in Table 1, nor in the Additional File 1. Growth medium (MRS-broth or GM17broth Merck, Amsterdam, the Netherlands [21]) was supplemented, when indicated, with heme (hemin) (Sigma,
stock solution: 0.5 mg/ml in 0.05 M NaOH) to a final
conc. of 2 μg/ml and/or vitamin K2 (menaquinone-4)
(Sigma, stock solution: 2 mg/ml in ethanol) to a final
conc. of 20 ng/ml. As a control the equivalent volume of
0.05 M NaOH or ethanol were added if no heme or
menaquinone was added respectively.
Aerobic growth conditions were achieved in shake flask
cultivations with a 1:10 medium/volume ratio, while
shaking at 250 rpm. For high throughput (96-wells microtiter plates) aerobic cultivations, microtiter plates were
filled with 150 μl medium/well (well volume μl 320),
covered with breathseals and incubated in a microtron,
shaking at 1000 rpm (Greiner Bio-one, Germany). The
conditions of cultures grown in stationary tubes were considered anaerobic (or micro-aerobic). All strains were
grown for 48 hours at 30°C before measuring biomass
(optical density at 600 nm) and acidification.
Measurement of menaquinone-content of bacterial cells
The following standard method was used for menaquinone measurement in cells; Overnight cultures were
washed twice in phosphate buffer (50 mM K2HPO4, pH
5.0) and re-suspended to an OD600 of 10. Of this cellsuspension 2 ml was lysed by bead beating, using 0.1 mm
silica-beads (Biospec products, Inc) in a Savant Bio 101
FastPrep FP120 and frozen till further use. Menaquinones
were extracted by thoroughly mixing 500 μl of this lysed
cell-suspension with 5 ml extraction buffer (90%hexane,
10% ethanol). The hexane layer was transferred to a new
tube after centrifugation. This extraction procedure was
repeated twice, and the combined hexane layers subse-

quently evaporated under nitrogen-gas. The precipitated
menaquinones were re-dissolved in 300 μl ethanol. This
menaquinone solution was analysed on a Thermo Finnigan (Waltham, MA) TSQ Quantum ms-ms system in combination with a Shimadzu (Kyoto, Japan) LC system. The
samples were injected on a Synergi 4μ MAX-RP 80A 150 ×
2 mm (Phenomenex) column where the compounds were
eluted with a linear gradient, starting with 100% water/
methanol 25/75 to 100% 2-propanol and detected with
ms-ms. The TSQ Quantum ms system was equipped with
an APCI (Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionization)
source, set in the negative mode. A capillary temperature
of 210°C was used with a vaporizer temperature of 300°C
and a sheat gas pressure of 21psi. The collision energy for
measuring in ms2 was set at 38 Volt for all compounds.
Analysis of genomic content of sequenced lactic acid
bacteria
The presence of the cydABCD and the menaquinone biosynthesis genes were based on annotation of the respective complete genome sequences and by homology
analysis with Lactococcus lactis MG1363 gene-products,
using BLASTP 2.2.18 (basic local alignment search tool)
[12,22]. Comparison of genomic local organization was
performed using the KEGG genome map http://
www.kegg.com/, and the pinned region function of ERGO
http://ergo.integratedgenomics.com/ERGO/.
DNA handling techniques
The identification of the genomic site of integration of the
transposase gene, of the selected respiratory-defective,
Lactococcus lactis B1157 mutants, was performed as
described previously [23].
Phylogenetic analysis of the cyd-genes
Each individual cydABCD gene product of Lactococcus lactis
MG1363 was entered as a query to search for homologues
in other lactic acid bacteria using the BLAST algorithm [22].
Sequence entries found to be homologous were retrieved
(june '08) from GenBank, and separately aligned using the
MUSCLE algorithm [24]. From the amino acid sequence
alignments, bootstrapped neighbor joining trees were
obtained using Clustal [25] with default settings, except for
the number of iterations, which was set to 1000. Trees were
analyzed in LOFT [26] and visualized in MEGA3 [27]. An
identical exercise was carried out for 16S rRNA sequences
from the organisms that were found to contain cyd-genes.
Finally, the topology of the four trees, based on the cyd-gene
products, was analyzed and compared to a standard phylogeny tree based on 16S rRNA.

Results
Screening for respiration in lactic acid bacteria
Respiration in Lactococcus lactis is easily induced by addition of heme, and results in enhanced growth efficiency
with an almost doubling of biomass (Fig 1). Although

http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/8/1/28

Lactococcus Lactis cells grown without heme are less
robust, in the complex medium used, extensive cell-lysis
after the onset of the stationary phase is not apparent [15].
The final pH, at the end of the exponential growth phase
tends to be higher in respiring cultures when compared to
aerobic cultures (grown without heme). This higher final
pH is a result of more progressive conversion of lactate to
acetate during respiration [15]. We screened a diverse
range of lactic acid bacteria (both species and strains) for
similar heme induced growth stimulation. Of the 29 different species of lactic acid bacteria that were aerobically
cultivated, 6 were clearly stimulated by the presence of
heme (Table 2 and 3). In addition to Lactococcus lactis, the
presence of heme led to increased biomass formation in
Carnobacterium divergens, Enterococcus casseliflavus, Lactobacillus paralimentarius, Streptococcus entericus, and Streptococcus uberis, although the pH did drop.
Menaquinones form a part of electron transport chains,
facilitating membranous electron transfer [28]. Many lactic acid bacteria are unable to produce menaquinones
(more widely known as vitamin K2). Addition of both
heme and menaquinone to aerated cultures of Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1 increased the final (stationary
phase) biomass and pH, quite similar to the heme supplemented phenotype of Lactococcus lactis (Fig 1 and Table
3). This is in agreement with the absence of a complete
gene-set, in Lactobacillus plantarum, for menaquinone
biosynthesis http://www.kegg.com. The measured biomass (OD600) levels of Lactobacillus plantarum, grown
with or without heme and menaquinone, remained relatively stable after the onset of the stationary phase (data
not shown). In our selection of lactic acid bacteria we
observed that Lactococcus garviae, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus brevis and Enterococcus faecalis also
require both heme and menaquinone for aerobic growth
stimulation (Table 3). As reported in literature, a combination of these cofactors also stimulate biomass formation in Streptococcus agalactiae NEM316 [20].
Furthermore, heme-induced cytochrome formation in
Leuconostoc mesenteriodes (NCIB 9917) and Enterococcus faecalis (V538) has also been reported [6,19,29,30].
Distribution of cyd-genes in lactic acid bacteria
Currently there are 62 sequenced genomes of lactic acid
bacteria available in the NCBI database of which 45 are
complete
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sutils/
genom_table.cgi. We examined the potential for respiration in this diverse set of lactic acid bacteria as indicated
by the presence of the cydABCD genes in their genomes.
The cydA and cydB encode for the structural subunits, and
cydC and cydD are required for assembly of the bd-type
cytochrome [31]. Using BLASTP and available annotation, we found that in 22 of these genomes all four cydgenes were present (Table 4) [22].

Lactococcus lactis MG1363 and Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1 were grown aerobically overnight at 30°C in

In the case of Lactobacillus brevis ATCC367 cydC has degenerated to a pseudo gene. Streptococcus agalactiae NEM316
has four open reading frames (gbs1787-1784) with a high
similarity to cydABCD of Lactococcus lactis MG1363 and a
similar operon structure. Lactobacillus casei ATCC334 possesses, besides a cydABCD- operon, a separate fusion gene
of cydA and cydB. The genome of Streptococcus agalactiae
H36B contains 3 genes that are annotated as cydA Of
these, SAI_1857 lies in an operon together with cydBCD
while SAI_1865 and SAI_1866 are next to each other on
the chromosome. SAI_1865 and SAI_1866 are truncated
versions of cydA and are unlikely to encode a functional
subunit I of the bd-type cytochrome.
Although, there is some confusion in the annotation of
the open reading frames as either cydC or cydD genes
among the lactic acid bacteria, the presence or absence of
all four if the cyd-genes could be unambiguously determined for the studied sequenced genomes.

Next, we constructed a phylogenetic tree for each of the
cydABCD genes. For this purpose, we used the cyd-gene
products (AA-sequences) found in the lactic acid bacteria,
and also as found in many non-lactic acid bacteria. Overall, the topologies of the phylogenetic trees made for cydA,
cydB, cydC and cydD, resembled each other and the canonical phylogenetic (evolutionary) trees based on 16S rRNA.
In all cases the lactic acid bacteria cluster together, and are
neighbored by representatives of Listeria and Bacillus,
forming the Firmicutes branch (Fig 2).
We compared the responses to heme (and menaquinone)
(both observed in this work and reported in literature)
with the genomic presence of the cydABCD genes and
menaquinone biosynthesis. For the sequenced species
Lactococcus lactis MG1363, SK11, Lactobacillus plantarum
WCFS1, Enterococcus faecalis V583, Streptococcus agalactiae
NEM316 there is a match between genotype and phenotype. Heme enhanced aerobic growth (biomass) has also

been observed for Oenococcus oeni (A. Gruss presented at
the LAB9 congress, Egmond aan Zee, 31 Aug–4 Sep,
2008). These species show respiration behavior (either
biomass stimulation or formation of cytochromes) and
have cyd-genes present on their genomes. Furthermore, as
mentioned, Lactococcus lactis is known to produces
menaquinones, whereas both Lactobacillus plantarum
WCFS1 and Streptococcus agalactiae NEM316 lack many
genes typically involved in menaquinone biosynthesis
http://www.kegg.com. This is thus also in line with our
observations of the dependency on both heme and
menaquinone. Also relevant, in this respect is that we did
not observe that heme stimulated biomass formation in
Lactobacillus sakei 23K, Lactobacillus delbrueckii B1799 (not
sequenced) or in Pediococcus pentosaceus DSM 20333.
There are some discrepancies however, as the sequenced
Leuconostoc mesenteroides ATCC 8239 has all four cyd-genes
and menaquinone biosynthesis genes, but in our hands,
did not show enhanced production of biomass, in the
presence of heme (and menaquinone). Heme-induced
cytochrome formation has, however, been reported for
other strains of Leuconostoc mesenteroides [6]. Furthermore,
Enterococcus faecalis B145 required both heme and
menaquinone, while the sequenced strain Enterococcus
faecalis V538 appears to have a complete menaquinone
biosynthesis pathway http://www.kegg.com.
Menaquinone production by Lactococcus lactis MG1363
The production of menaquinones by several lactic acid
bacteria, such as Lactococcus lactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides has been observed during non-respiratory (anaeorobic) conditions [10]. We have cultivated the Lactococcus
lactis MG1363, in both respiratory and non-respiratory
conditions to study its influence on the composition of
the menaquinone pool (Table 5). Menaquinones can vary
in their side-chain length (or the number of isoprenoid
residues) although species with more than 10 isoprenoid
residues are not typically found in (grampositive) lactic
acid bacteria [32]. Assuming that the levels of menaquinone with 11 or more isoprenoid residues in their sidechain are negligible, we observed that, contrary to expectations, the total production of menaquinones was highest in anaerobic conditions by roughly 2-fold. In
particular, the level of the menaquinone k2(3) was elevated in anaerobic conditions. In aerobic conditions, the
concentration of menaquinone-species with 9 and 10 isoprenoid residues (k2(9), k2(10)) were elevated.
Respiration is species-specific
The presence or absence of the cyd-genes in various species
is remarkably consistent, as shown in table 4 and the corresponding text. The cyd-genes were not present in the
(completely sequenced) genomes of any of the strains of
Streptococcus pyogenes (13), Streptococcus pneumoniae (11),

http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/8/1/28

Streptococcus suis (2), Streptococcus thermophilus (3) and
Lactobacillus delbrueckii (2), but consistently present in all
Streptococcus agalactiae (8), Lactococcus lactis (3), Lactobacillus reuteri (2) and Oenococcus oeni (2) strains. Furthermore, in two separate studies 43 strains of Lactobacillus
plantarum were genotyped and their genomic content
compared to the genome of Lactobacillus plantarum
WCFS1. In all these 43 genomes the cydABCD operon was
determined to be present [33] (and Tseneva, personal
communication). To determine if the respiratory-phenotype is as consistent as the genotype, we tested 88 strains
of Lactococcus lactis (including SK11, MG1363 and
IL1403) and 20 strains of Lactobacillus plantarum (including WCFS1). Heme (and vitamin K2) induced the respiratory response (enhanced biomass formation) in 95% of
the Lactococcus lactis strains, and in 80% of the Lactobacillus plantarum strains (data not shown). One of the 4 Lactococcus lactis strains that did not respond to heme was the
sequenced strain IL1403. In this particular case, we
observed that a transposase is situated directly in front of
the cyd-genes on the genome, which could be responsible
for this lack of heme-induced response. For the other 3
Lactococcus lactis strains, that did not respond to the presence of heme, no extensive genomic information is available. Both the genotypic data and the growth experiments
indicate that respiration is characteristic for a diverse
group of lactic acid bacterial species.
High-throughput respiration screening
By using an insertion knock-out bank of Lactococcus lactis
B1157, we show that high throughput screening, in 96well plates, is possible to isolate heme-stimulated lactic
acid bacteria [23]. Approximately 8000 insertion mutants
were aerobically incubated (with or without heme) and
screened on biomass yield.

A total of 73 mutants were found which showed no significant biomass increase upon cultivation with heme. The
position of integration of the insertion-knockout vector
was determined in 13 of these 74 mutants by analysis of
the surrounding genome sequence. The genomic region
and the genes of Lactococcus lactis B1157 that were disrupted by the insertion event were identified by comparison with the Lactococcus lactis MG1363 genome sequence
(Table 6).
Five of the isolated respiration mutants carried mutations
in genes involved in menaquinone biosynthesis. Respiration mutants with disruptions of aroB and aroE are also
likely to suffer from an impaired menaquinone biosynthesis, since these genes are involved in synthesis of chorismate, the menaquinone precursor molecule. Three
mutants were found that carried disruptions in the cydgenes that are obviously essential to synthesize the bd-type
cytochrome. Furthermore, we have now experimental evi-

L. lactis MG1363 was grown overnight with(out) 2 μg/ml heme and with(out) aeration. Washed cells were analyzed for menaquinone content on
HPLC. Menaquinone species with side-chain lengths varying from 2 to 10 (K2(2) - K2(10)) isoprenoid residues could be distinguished.

dence that a disruption of noxA, annotated as a NADHdehydrogenase is directly linked to a respiration negative
phenotype. 11 out of 13 respiration mutants carry mutations in genes that can be readily explained and thus validate this high throughput method to screen for
respiration in lactic acid bacteria.

Discussion
Lactococcus lactis MG1363 is capable of true respiration, as
shown by the formation of a proton motive force by its
heme-dependent electron transport chain [13]. We have
used the characteristic phenotype of respiring Lactococcus
lactis, a higher biomass with less extensive acidification, to
screen for other possibly respiring lactic acid bacteria.
Besides increased biomass production, respiration
includes other traits, such as enhanced robustness. This

makes the observation, that certain lactic acid bacteria are
respirators, relevant for industrial applications [15,16].
Induction respiratory behaviour requires supplementation with heme and menaquinone (vitamin K2) in several
additional species of lactic acid bacteria.
In the many cases, the heme-stimulated species showed
enhanced biomass formation without a higher final pH.
In these cases, although heme enhances aerobic growth,
possibly as a result of energy conservation and the protection against oxidative stress afforded by the electron transport chain, changes in type of acids produced seems less
important.
The addition of heme and menaquinone to the growth
medium, to induce respiration in several lactic acid bacte-

ria, may appear contrived. However, plants, the natural
source of isolation of many lactic acid bacteria, can provide both heme and menaquinone (A. Gruss presented at
the LAB9 congress, Egmond aan Zee, 31 Aug–4 Sep, 2008,
and personal communications).
The cyd-genes (cydABCD) are present in many species of
lactic acid bacteria. Most sequenced lactic acid bacteria
that were screened showed a match between their genotype (cyd-genes, menaquinone biosynthesis genes) and
the heme (and menaquinone) induced phenotype. Also
the dependence and independence of a menaquinone
source, in for example the Lactobacillus species and Lactococcus species, can be explained for some cases, with the
presence/absence of menaquinone biosynthesis.
The cyd-genes are not confined to a limited subset of
(closely related) species of lactic acid bacteria. In fact, the
cyd-genes are present in many species that together span
the diversity-range found in lactic acid bacteria [34]. What
is remarkable is that the cyd-genes are so consistently
present (or absent) in all the (sequenced) strains of a certain species, as can be clearly seen for the members of the
genus Streptococcus. This uniformity may be the result of a
bias in the isolation of the strains from highly similar
niches. We have, however, screened a large number of
Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactococcus lactis strains that
were isolated from a variety of both industrial and plantsources (see the materials and methods section). In both
cases the induction of respiration by addition of heme
and menaquinone was highly uniform with only a few
exceptions. We can conclude that respiration is characteristic trait for, at least, Lactococcus lactis and Lactobacillus
plantarum.
The high throughput screening of 8000 insertion mutants
of Lactococcus lactis revealed that a high proportion of the
respiration-impaired mutants contained insertions in
menaquinone-biosynthesis genes. This implies that such
methods can be used to screen for menaquinone producers among lactic acid bacteria. Those lactic acid bacteria
that are stimulated by heme alone are potential producers
of menaquinones.
Roughly half of the sequenced lactic acid bacteria contain
the cydABCD genes. We investigated whether such a distribution could best be explained by horizontal gene transfer or, alternatively, by gene loss. The phylogenetic tree,
constructed with the cyd genes sequences (Fig 2) is highly
similar to the canonical (16S rRNA) evolutionary tree.
Thus all lactic acid bacteria group together in one separate
branch, which indicates ancient origins of the bd-type
cytochrome. The results presented here not only support
the idea that the cyd genes were present in the common
ancestor of lactic acid bacteria, but in fact of all Firmicutes.

http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/8/1/28

Thus gene loss events best explains the observed cyd-gene
distribution amongst lactic acid bacteria, which is in line
with their highly auxotrophic nature. Lactic acid bacteria
as a group have a history of adaptation to nutrient rich
food-environments and progressive gene-loss that was
nicely visualised by Makarova et.al. [35]. A typical example of this process is the extensive gene decay (high abundance of pseudo-genes) in the yoghurt-bacterium
Streptococcus thermophilus [36].
(Mena)quinones are best known as cofactors of bacterial
respiratory chains, shuttling electrons from dehydrogenases to the terminal oxidase. Menaquinone production
in anaerobic, non-heme supplemented conditions have
been reported in literature before for other Lactococcus lactis strains and Leuconostoc sp. [10]. Several groups have
proposed an additional role of menaquinones in offering
protection against oxidative stress [37,38]. Recently it has
been shown that quinones of Lactococcus lactis can reduce
metal-ions such as Fe3+ and Cu2+, which may facilitate
their assimilation [39]. Still, contrary to expectations
when Lactococcus lactis was grown aerobically (both with
and without heme), the total amount of menaquinones
produced was almost two-fold lower compared with
anaerobic conditions. Furthermore we observed that aerobic cultivation induces an altered composition of the
menaquinone pool, with a shift towards menaquinones
with more 9–10 isoprenoid residues in their side-chain.
This study reports that respiration in several lactic acid
bacteria can be induced by a combination of heme and
vitamin K2(4) (with four isoprenoid residues). It is thus
not known what function the observed shift, in the composition of the menaquinone-pool to menaquinones
with a longer side-chain length, serves in these bacteria. In
humans, however, menaquinones with longer side-chain
remain detectable for longer times in the blood stream
and may form a more available source of vitamin K2 [40].
Therefore, induction of the production of menaquinone
with longer side-chains by lactic acid bacteria may better
fulfil human vitamin K2 requirements. The function of
menaquinones, in the (anaerobic) metabolism of Lactococcus lactis, is unclear. For example, the various menaquinone mutants of Lactococcus lactis grew well anaerobically
and aerobically (data not shown). In fact many species of
lactic acid bacteria grow well both anaerobically as aerobically, although not all of these produce menaquinones.
Since, lactic acid bacteria do not depend on menaquinone
for growth they make ideal organisms to study the impact
of the menaquinones, with various side-chain lengths, on
(respiratory) metabolism.
This work has revealed that a number of known lactic acid
bacteria are potential respirators which, as in the case of
Lactococcus lactis, could be targeted for future industrial
exploitation.
