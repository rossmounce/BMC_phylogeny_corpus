Abstract
Background: The ornamental crop Calluna vulgaris is of increasing importance to the horticultural
industry in the northern hemisphere due to a flower organ mutation: the flowers of the 'bud-flowering'
phenotype remain closed i.e. as buds throughout the total flowering period and thereby maintain more
colorful flowers for a longer period of time than the wild-type. This feature is accompanied and presumably
caused by the complete lack of stamens. Descriptions of this botanical particularity are inconsistent and
partially conflicting. In order to clarify basic questions of flower organ identity in general and stamen loss
in detail, a study of the wild-type and the 'bud-flowering' flower type of C. vulgaris was initiated.
Results: Flowers were examined by macro- and microscopic techniques. Organ development was
investigated comparatively in both the wild-type and the 'bud-flowering' type by histological analyses.
Analysis of epidermal cell surface structure of vegetative tissues and perianth organs using scanning
electron microscopy revealed that in wild-type flowers the outer whorls of colored organs may be
identified as sepals, while the inner ones may be identified as petals. In the 'bud-flowering' type, two whorls
of sepals are directly followed by the gynoecium. Both, petals and stamens, are completely missing in this
flower type. The uppermost whorl of green leaves represents bracts in both flower types.
In addition, two MADS-box genes (homologs of AP3/DEF and SEP1/2) were identified in C. vulgaris using
RACE-PCR. Expression analysis by qRT-PCR was conducted for both genes in leaves, bracts, sepals and
petals. These experiments revealed an expression pattern supporting the organ classification based on
morphological characteristics.
Conclusions: Organ identity in both wild-type and 'bud-flowering' C. vulgaris was clarified using a
combination of microscopic and molecular methods. Our results for bract, sepal and petal organ identity
are supported by the 'ABCDE model'. However, loss of stamens in the 'bud-flowering' phenotype is an
exceptional flower organ modification that cannot be explained by modified spatial expression of known
organ identity genes.

Background
Calluna vulgaris L. (Hull.) (Fig. 1A) belongs to the order
Ericales, which comprises 25 families including 346 genera with more than 11,500 species in total [1]. The Ericales
incorporate about 5.9% of core eudicot diversity, one
third of which is made up of the Ericaceae alone [1]. The
economic significance of C. vulgaris to the horticultural
industry in Europe and North-America is continually
increasing [2]. The current market share in Germany for
instance, amounts to approximately 141 million EUR, or
> 100 million plants per year, respectively [2]. In principal, this economic significance is the results of a single but
considerable change in the flower morphology: the loss of
stamens that is accompanied by a non-opening of the
flower bud. In contrast to wild-type flowers (Fig. 1A) that
are only attractive from August to October the resulting
'bud-flowering' phenotype (Fig. 1B) preserves its unpollinated stigmas within the never-opening buds and has an
extended flowering period up to December. For this reason, it is the most valuable flower type of this species to
the horticultural business. In contrast, other forms, such
as the 'filled' or the 'multi-bracteate' types are less important. Previous investigations revealed the monogenic
recessive inheritance of the 'bud-flowering' trait [3] that
was described in literature for the first time (as far as
known by the authors) in 1935 [4].
The synoecious flower of wild-type C. vulgaris is of radial
symmetry, posing with two outer perianth whorls with
four to five colored organs in each whorl, two whorls of
four to five stamens and four to five coadunate carpels [57]. The sepals are grouped into two distinct whorls of two
times two [8]. The colored organs of the perianth whorl II
are fused at the receptacle to form a corolla tube [5,9].
Two whorls of at least six green leaves in total surround
the flower [10]. These uppermost whorls of green leaves
do not match the perianth symmetry, since they are
aligned with the sepal whorl instead with the petal whorl
(Fig. 1C: indicated as ugl).
In contrast, the 'bud-flowering' type completely lacks the
male reproductive organs, which is probably at least one
of the reasons for its developmental arrest in the bud
stage. In 1986, three different subforms of the 'bud-flowering' type were described [[11], page 281]: f. diplocalyx ('
[...] eight instead of four sepals and usually neither stamens nor corolla [...]'), f. polysepala (' [...] similar to f.
diplocalyx but [...] there are indeed many sepals, more than
eight.') and f. clistanthes (' [...] flower parts are present in
the normal number, but the corolla never, or hardly,
opens.'). Evidences or justifications for this classification
of organs e.g. of the colored organs either as sepals or petals are absent [5,11]. Moreover, no explanation is given
for the grouping of the sepals into two whorls and for the
grouping of stamen in two whorls [5,8]. Furthermore, the
described classification of f. polysepala and f. clisthantes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/148

could not be reproduced by the authors, since the cultivars
that are given as examples all looked like the diplocalyxtype in our hands.
Two different approaches are commonly applied to identify organ characteristics in the perianth of angiosperms:
morphological comparisons and gene expression studies
[12]. The molecular procedure mainly investigates the
expression of the floral homeotic genes. According to the
classical 'ABCDE'-model of flower organ identity, changes
in flower morphology are the results of expression shifts
of different classes of floral homeotic genes encoding transcription factors in the corresponding whorls (see, e.g.
[[13,14] or [15]]): class A gene function in the outmost
whorl leads to the formation of sepals; combined expression of class A and B genes in the second whorl leads to
the formation of petals; class B and C gene function in
whorl three promotes the development of stamens, and
expression of class C genes in the innermost whorl leads
to the development of carpels. Additionally, class D gene
function is required for ovule formation, whereas class E
gene function is required for the development of all
organs, respectively (see. e.g. [16-19]). Several studies
demonstrated that the perianth organs can be distinguished by the assessment of their epidermal cell surface
structure by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as
shown in Arabidopsis thaliana [16] or in the Ericales (Impatiens, Marcgravia) [20]. Both assays - the morphological
and the molecular assay - have to be regarded as complementary [12].
Regarding the indistinct descriptions and the lack of current in-depth studies and molecular data in C. vulgaris,
several uncertainties still exist on the topic of the flower
organ identity in this species. On the one hand, questions
arise regarding the discrete identity of the two outer
whorls of colored organs. On the other hand, the lack of
the androecium in the 'bud-flowering' type has not been
ascertained either. Until now, it is even uncertain, whether
stamen development is been initiated or whether the initiation of primordia is inhibited.
The determination of the flower organ identity and the
understanding of the development of the 'bud-flowering'
mutation itself are of importance for future breeding
efforts in C. vulgaris since the 'bud-flowering' phenotype is
the most important breeding target in this species. We
therefore initiated histological, microscopic and molecular examinations to clarify the identity of flower organs
and of existent differences between wild-type and 'budflowering' phenotypes.

Results
In order to elucidate the unknown organ identities of the
two most important flower phenotypes in C. vulgaris
flower development was monitored histologically for

both, the wild-type as well as the 'bud-flowering' type. In
addition, the perianth organs were examined by SEM and
became successfully distinguishable among themselves
and if compared to bracts and leaves. In order to achieve
a better understanding of mutations in flower morphology in this crop, an initial cloning of two MADS-box genes
was realized in addition to preliminary expression analyses. The genome size was determined in order to evaluate
the chances of future cloning of new unknown genes by
map-based cloning.

by the occurrence of a channel, in which most of the stomata are located (Fig. 3CD), whereas the adaxial side is
covered with hair-like structures (Fig. 3EF). Therefore, we
assume these uppermost whorls of green leaves to be
bracts. However, bracts and leaves resemble each other in
the occurrence of stomata (not shown for leaves) which,
in contrast, we did not observe in any colored perianth
organ.
Cloning of MADS-box genes
MADS-box transcription factors were identified using
RACE-PCR. Our initial 3'-RACE experiments resulted in
the cloning of two gene fragments, one putative AP3/DEFlike gene we named CvAP3 [Genbank:GQ202026], and
one SEP1/2-like gene we named CvSEP1 [Genbank:GQ202027]. For CvAP3, the sequence data resulted
from three independent experimental PCR and cloning
assays. CvSEP1 was cloned by chance since the primer was
originally designed to amplify B-genes. Thus, CvSEP1
could not be verified independently until now. Both partial genes were obtained by cloning a PCR fragment of
approximately 950 bp.

Morphological perianth organ analysis of the wild-type
and the 'bud-flowering' phenotype
In wild-type phenotypes, the whorl II organs are commonly fused at their base and are more delicate compared
to whorl I organs, which are clearly separated and appear
quite robust. In contrast, 'bud-flowering' organs of whorl
II are not fused and resemble the whorl I organs in shape,
color and stability. SEM of the abaxial and adaxial epidermis structures (n = 4 varieties each) of whorl I and whorl
II organs in both the wild-type and the 'bud-flowering'
phenotype was carried out (Fig. 2) to identify, whether
whorl I organs in the wild-type can be identified as sepals
or petals and in order to clarify the identity of the whorl II
organs in the 'bud-flowering' phenotype. Cells of the outermost whorls of the wild-type phenotype are flat and
stretched (Fig. 2AB). In contrast, cells of the second whorl
appear bloated ('dome-shaped'), are shorter in diameter
and length and are striated with papillate structures (Fig.
2CD). On the contrary, the cell surfaces of the 'bud-flowering' perianth organs are indistinguishable from each
other, since both whorls consist of the flat and stretched
cell type (Fig. 2E-H), comparable to the outmost whorl of
the wild-type. In particular, the second whorl leaves are
not 'dome-shaped'. Thus, concerning whorl I organs of
the wild-type phenotype, both their position and their cell
surface structure indicate a sepaloid identity, whereas
their color suggests a petaloid identity. Regarding whorl II
organs, all three criteria investigated may be a hint to petaloid identity. In contrast, all organs in both perianth
whorls of the 'bud-flowering' phenotypes are morphologically not distinguishable and show the same characteristics as whorl I organs of the wild-type phenotype.
Therefore, they are likewise presumably to be identified as
sepals by two out of the three criteria mentioned above;
once more, their coloring suggests a petaloid identity.

Using the BLAST conserved domain database [21], the Kbox and the (partial) MADS-box were identified in CvAP3,
and the K-box in CvSEP1. Furthermore, both the EuAP3
motif and the PI derived motif [22] were identified within
CvAP3, whereas the CvSEP1 gene included the SEP I and
SEP II motif [23]. The latter motif, also termed as AGL2/
SEP1 terminal motif [24], may be used to discriminate
SEP1/2 (the LOFSEP clade) and SEP3 genes: SEP3 genes
are missing this motif, but instead, they contain either the
AGL9/SEP3 or the ZmM7 motif [24]. Our approach to furthermore determine gene homology by calculating phylogenetic similarities based on nucleotide alignments
(Additional Files 1 and 2) resulted in unrooted phylograms (Additional Files 3 and 4) of sparse information
content due to low posterior probability values for C. vulgaris samples. The connection of CvAP3 remains unresolved, since it is rather placed near the Arabidopsis
outgroup than near any of the included genes of the Ericales family (Primula, Marcgravia, Impatiens). In case of
CvSEP1, the Calluna gene is placed near Diospyros kaki
which is, beneath Impatiens, the only available sample
from the Ericales. In both cases, the anticipated outgroup
genes are identifiable.

Differentiation between bracts and leaves by morphological characteristics became possible via SEM analysis of
both tissues (Fig 3). The surface structure of leaf tissue of
both flower types (Fig. 3AB) showed a puzzle-like cell
structuring, both on ad- and abaxial sides. In contrast, in
the uppermost whorls of green leaves of both flower types
as indicated in Fig. 1C, we identified a slightly differing
cell structure. The abaxial side (Fig. 3CD) is characterised

Molecular perianth organ analysis of the wild-type and the
'bud-flowering' type
The relative expression of the C. vulgaris AP3/DEF- and
SEP1/2-like genes was analysed in three different genotypes per flower type (Fig. 4). ΔΔCt-values have been calculated to compare expression levels between the different
flower tissues including bracts and the leaf tissue of the
corresponding flower type, since the expression of both

genes was lowest (albeit present, compared to the normalizer) in leaves. For better comparison between wild-type
(Fig. 4AC) and 'bud-flowering' (Fig. 4BD) samples, the Yaxes are uniformly scaled for each gene.
Although the expression levels of both genes were genotype-specific, an overall organ-specific expression patterns
were revealed. The expression levels of CvAP3 significantly
increased in whorl II organs of the wild-type compared to
whorl I organs and bracts in the three tested genotypes
(Fig. 4A). Only 'Roter Oktober' showed an increased
expression of CvAP3 in whorl I organs, too (albeit lower
compared to whorl II). This petal-related increase of
mRNA amount was not observed in all three 'bud-flower-

ing' genotypes (Fig. 4B). These data support the morphological classification of whorl II organs in the 'budflowering' types to be a second whorl of sepals.
For CvSEP1 (Fig. 4CD), expression was higher in both
perianth whorls in both flower types with an at least 1.7X
increase of expression between bracts and whorl I organs.
The variety 'Roter Oktober' showed an almost 1.4X higher
expression of CvSEP1 in whorl I organs than in whorl II
organs. In the 'bud-flowering' phenotypes, the expression
of CvSEP1 did not differ markedly between whorl I and
whorl II organs (except for 'Annegret', approx. 2.5X
increase) and was clearly lower if compared to the corresponding wild-type organs, respectively. The differences

of especially CvSEP1 gene expression between leaf tissue
and the uppermost green leaves furthermore supports our
morphology-based classification of the latter ones as
bracts.
For both target genes, the unusual expression in leaf tissue
was confirmed in several independent samples of different ages of three other wild-type and 'bud-flowering' genotypes. Cloning and sequencing of these PCR products
confirmed the identity of the amplified transcripts.
Floral formula of different flower types
Since we were not able to decide whether organs of the
same identity were arranged in one or several whorls, we
uniformly speak of one whorl per organ type, except for
flower types with changes in organ identity. Thus, the floral formulas presented are based on the described morphological (e.g. cell surface structure) and molecular
results and not on positional information of the organs.

In contrast to the wild-type (Ca4Co(4)A8G(4), Fig. 5A; Ca:
calyx; Co: corolla; A: androecium; G; gynoecium), the
'bud-flowering' phenotype completely lacks stamens
whereas its petals are transformed to sepals
(Ca4+4Co0A0G(4), Fig. 5B). This type corresponds to the
'diplocalyx' type [12].
Flower organ development
Flower organ development of the wild-type and the 'budflowering' type were investigated comparatively by histological analysis. Samples were derived from the uppermost part of shoots for which the initiation of flower
development could undoubtedly be ascertained. Fig. 6
shows three equal stages of both the wild-type and the
'bud-flowering' type in parallel. Generative meristems of
both flower types did not differ anatomically (Fig. 6AD).
Both flower types also show the development of stamen
primordia (Fig. 6BE). We classify these as such as a consequence of experiments in A. thaliana [25], since these
authors describe initial nectary development during
developmental stage 9. However, petal and stamen primordia already arise during the developmental stage 5
[26]. Therefore, nectary primordia in C. vulgaris seem not
to develop until carpel formation. When the carpels are
clearly recognizable as such (Fig 6CF), the comparison of
wild-type and 'bud-flowering' types reveals there is no
residual indication of former stamen formation in the latter phenotype.

Interestingly, petal and sepal tissues are differently stained
in the wild-type (Fig. 6C) but both whorls of petaloid
sepal organs in the 'bud-flowering' type display the same
staining pattern (Fig. 6F). Furthermore, in the wild-type,
petals and stamens show a comparable staining pattern
and petals consist of an increased amount of cell layers if

compared to the petaloid sepals of the wild-type and the
'bud-flowering' type. This becomes even more obvious in
opened, mature flowers of each type, using SGL instead of
FCA staining (Fig. 7).
Estimation of the genome size
The genome size of C. vulgaris was estimated by laserbased flowcytometry since the knowledge of this parameter is essential for future genetic applications. We compared seven wild-type, two 'bud-flowering', one 'filled'
and one 'multi-bracteate' genotype from different countries (Table 1). Three to six replications of each sample led
to an overall average genome size of 1.1799 +/- 0.0028
pg/2C (mean +/- standard error, n = 50). According to the
equation given by [27], from this the total DNA length of

wild-type and 'bud-flowering' phenotypes as summed up
in the given floral formulas.

Discussion

In wild-type flowers sepals and petals are morphologically
clearly distinguishable. In contrast, regarding the 'budflowering' type, our anatomical analyses revealed that
whorl II organs are macroscopically indistinguishable
from the whorl I organs. In both flower types the uppermost green leaves have been identified as bracts, since
they differ morphologically from both, sepals as well as
leaves.

The vague and differing descriptions of the flower anatomy ([5,6,8,11]) of C. vulgaris necessitated more in-depth
investigations regarding the flower organ identity. We
combined different microscopic (e.g. SEM) and molecular
analyses (qRT-PCR), since both approaches are complementary (see, e.g. [12] and references therein). As a result
from the indications received from these analyses, we
were able to appoint the organ numbers for C. vulgaris

B: 'bud-flowering';
These morphological and anatomical data were supported by our gene expression analyzes. We detected
expression of CvAP3, a class B-like MADS-box gene,
mainly in the inner perianth organs of the wild-type phenotype. According to the classical 'ABCDE model' and its
modifications, we anticipated expression of the AP3/DEFlike gene to be restricted to whorls II and whorls III [13].
In contrast, no difference of expression was observed
between the whorl I and II organs in the 'bud-flowering'

type, which supports our morphological (SEM) data suggesting an additional whorl of petaloid sepals and the
coincidental loss of petals in this flowering type. Thus, differential expression of CvAP3 consistently reflects changes
and similarities in the morphology of whorl I and whorl
II flower organs in the wild-type as well as in the 'budflowering' type. However, these differences are of a quantitative and not of a qualitative nature. The gradual
decrease of AP3/DEF-like gene expression between petals

and sepals that we reported for one of three genotypes
tested is already known from other Ericales (Impatiens
hawkeri, [20]).
The expression pattern of CvSEP1, a class E-like MADSbox gene, reflects the expectations resulting from experiments in model organisms; namely, expression of SEP1/2like genes was expectable for whorls II-IV, although
'expression in sepals is common but not universal' ([24],
page 431). In C. vulgaris wild-type flowers, this expression
was consistently reproduced expect for the variety 'Roter
Oktober' that showed a surprisingly high and increased
mRNA amount in whorl I. In 'bud-flowering' phenotypes,
the petal whorl is presumably transformed into sepaloid
sepals and thus, expression of CvSEP1 is lower, but comparable between whorl I and II.
Regarding the identification of bracts, our expression
analyses also confirmed the morphological argumentation. On the one hand, the higher expression of both
CvAP3 and CvSEP1 in these organs indicates a clear difference to leaves, especially for CvSEP1. On the other hand,
besides the clear morphological dissimilarity, expression
of CvSEP1 was obviously repressed in these uppermost
green leaves compared to the sepals. Therefore, we identified these leaves as bracts. Again, this result is in line with
another Ericales (Marcgravia umbellata), in which a DEFlike gene was shown to be expressed at low levels in
bracteoles/sepals compared to petals or stamens of the
same species [20].
Expression of CvAP3 and CvSEP1 was detected and confirmed in leaves independent of tissue age for both flowering-related genes. Expression of floral organ identity
genes in non-floral tissues is already known from other
species. In Gerbera, the SEP1/2 gene GhGRCD2 is
expressed in vegetative tissues and SEP3, usually restricted
to the inner three whorls, is described to be expressed in
vegetative tissues in more than one species, too ([24] and
references therein). Likewise, in Rose expression of the
AP3-like gene MASAKO euB3 was detected in vegetative
tissue [28].
Regarding our results, it has to be borne in mind that,
according to the floral quartet model, floral organ identity
genes concertedly regulate the organ identity [29]. Petal
identity in eudicots, for example, is usually based on the
simultaneous occurrence of AP3/DEF-like, PI-like and
SEP3-like gene products, since these are all required for
establishing full petal identity. Furthermore, epidermal
cell shape is known to be controlled by MYB transcription
factors, which themselves are, in turn, under control of
class B-like genes [30,31]. It was shown recently, that SEP3
expression in A. thaliana is spatially distinguishable
between ab- and adaxial petal sides [32] and hence, may

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/148

be at least partially responsible for cell surface shaping as
it was already known for other SEP-like genes [33]. Thus,
our analyses necessarily remain incomplete and comprehensive results require substantially more laboratory and
phenotyping experiments. Nevertheless, we presumably
were able to differentiate all organs in question by expression analyses of just two putative MADS-Box transcription
factors.
The wild-type flower of C. vulgaris is synoecious, while the
final 'bud-flowering' flower is unisexually female due to a
total loss of once initiated stamens. This is in line with the
claim, that every unisexual flower that has been investigated until now showed a certain degree of initial hermaphroditic characteristics [34]. Whether the change of
organ identity in the perianth and the loss of stamen are
necessarily linked remains to be analysed.
Within the Ericaceae, the genome size is only known in
seven Vaccinium species [35]. Here, the nuclear DNA content ranged from 1.20 - 7.20 pg/2C. Knowledge of the
genome size is an essential prerequisite for prospective
genomic applications in this species including mapping
and genome walking for isolation of putative genes
responsible for the 'bud-flowering' genotype. Although
the measured value of 1.18 pg/2C is low, it is still approx.
four times higher than in Arabidopsis (0.3 pg/2C, [36].
Nevertheless, it facilitates the construction of a BAC (Bacterial Artificial Chromosome) library and subsequent
map-based cloning.

Conclusions
Our study presents a first step towards the analyses of
flower organ identity and their modifications in the ornamental crop C. vulgaris. We confirmed the identity of petals, sepals and bracts in wild-type as well as in the 'budflowering' phenotypes.
The simultaneous degeneration of stamens and the conversion of petals to sepals in the 'bud-flowering' type cannot be explained by modifications of the 'ABCDE'-model.
Neither can apparent candidate genes be deduced from
comparison with other plant species so far.
Further investigations should include additional cloning
of further floral organ identity gene homologs as well as
studies of their expression in all floral organs of the relevant flower types. Since a comprehensive understanding
of the genetics of the 'bud-flowering' phenotype is a prerequisite for future breeding of this economically important ornamental crop, mapping of this trait with
subsequent map-based cloning will be the next step to
identify candidate genes, since the relatively small
genome size of C. vulgaris allows efficient construction of
a BAC library.

Methods
Histological Techniques and Microscopy
Tissues were fixed for at least 24 h in AFE (10.4 : 1 : 1 96%
ethanol : formalin : acetic acid) or for max. 4 h in BouinAllen's compound (14 : 5: 1 picronitric acid : formol : acetic acid + 1.48% (w/v) CrO3), dehydrated by an increasing
ethanol/isopropanol series, infiltrated and embedded in
paraffin under low air pressure conditions, and sectioned
at varying μm-intervals using a Leica RM2155 microtome.
The sections were stained with either FCA (fuchsin
CI42520, chryosidine CI11270, astral blue CI48048;
staining: 5 min; washing: H2O, 10 sec; 2× washing: 30%
ethanol, 30 sec; differentiation: 70% ethanol, 30 sec; 2×
washing: 30% ethanol) or SGL (safranine CI 50240,
pyoctanin blue CI 42535, acid green CI 42095; staining I:
safranine, 60 min; washing: H2O, 2 min; staining II:
pyoctanin blue, 3 min; washing: H2O, 5 min; washing:
isopropanol, 1 min: staining III: acid green, 1 min; 4×
washing: isopropanol, clove oil, isopropanol, terpineol
(each 1 min)) and photographed by a Zeiss Axio
Imager.A1. The macroscopical analysis of the flower morphology was performed using a Leica Wild MZ3 stereo
microscope. The following varieties were used: 'Wink 12006', 'Wink 2-2006' ('bud-flowering'), 'Roter Oktober',
SanRemo (wild-type).
Scanning Electron Microscopy
Samples were fixed over night in FAEG (ethanol (65%),
acetic acid (5%), 37% formaldehyde (3.2%), 50% glutaraldehyde (0.2%), Tween-20 (0.1%), H2O) and dehydrated by an ethanol series: 15 min 80% ethanol, 15 min
90% ethanol, 15 min 96% ethanol, 3 × 20 min 100% ethanol. The samples were then transferred to 100% acetone
(3 × 20 min) and subsequently critical point dried using
liquid CO2 in an EMITECH K850. The leaves were
mounted on Leit-Tabs and gold-coated (sputter-coater:
EMITECH K500). Observations of the abaxial and adaxial
sides of the perianth organs of each three genotypes were
performed using a Philips XL30 ESEM (at the Institute of
Systematic Zoology and Evolutionary Biology, University
of Jena) with a voltage of 10 kV.

The following varieties were investigated: 'Battle of Arnhem', 'Karmina', 'Roter Oktober', 'Silver Knight' (all wildtype) and 'Adrie', 'Annegret', 'Nicole', 'Wink 2-2006' (all
'bud-flowering'). Selected, representative images are
shown in Figs. 2 and 3.
Cloning of MADS-box genes
Total RNA of wild-type C. vulgaris 'Roter Oktober' flower
buds was isolated using a modified protocol of the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit ([37], Qiagen) and subsequently
reverse transcribed to first strand cDNA (Reverse Transcription System, Promega) using a standard oligo(dT)
primer: GACTCGAGTCGACATCTG(T)14. 3'-RACE-PCR
[38] was performed using a degenerated 5'-B-gene-MADSbox-specific primer (5'-TSAAGAAAGCWWARGAGCTYWCCG) and the corresponding 3'-nested primer derived
from the oligo(dT) primer. Amplified fragments of appropriate size were gel-extracted (Nucleo Spin Extract II kit,
Macherey-Nagel), ligated into the pDRIVE vector and
transformed into EZ cells (Qiagen PCR Cloning plus kit)
by heat-shock. Cells were plated on standard LB/Amp/
IPTG/X-Gal plates. Plasmid DNA from positive clones
(blue/white selection plus colony-PCR testing) was
extracted (E.Z.N.A. Plasmid mini kit II, Omega bio-tek)
and sequenced (MWG Biotech AG, JenaGen GmbH,
AGOWA GmbH).

Alignments of derived sequences were accomplished by
ClustalW2 [39] or T-Coffee [40]. BLASTx 2.2.19+ [41] and
BLASTn 2.2.19+ [42] were used to check the C. vulgaris
sequences for matching hits at the protein or nucleotide
level. Cloned genes were named using the abbreviation of
the species name and the gene class, respectively, and
uploaded to the GenBank database via Sequin.
Verification of gene identity was additionally performed
by motif analysis within alignments on protein level
(Additional Files 5 and 6). Phylogenetic data analysis was
performed using GeneDoc alignments [43] and Paup 4.0
[44].

Expression analysis (qRT-PCR)
Total RNA of the varieties under investigation was isolated
using the original manufacturer's protocol of the Invisorb
Spin Plant RNA Mini Kit. cDNA was reverse transcribed
using the original protocol of the QuantiTect Reverse
Transcription Kit (Qiagen). To provide better sample
comparability, isolation and reverse transcription was
performed simultaneously for all samples. qRT-PCR primers (Table 2) were designed to target the AP3/DEF- and
SEP1/2-like genes using Primer3Plus [45]. The partial
sequence of C. vulgaris 18S rRNA [GenBank:AF419797]
was used to design normalizing primers. PCR reactions (3
independent runs with each 3 technical replicates of three
'bud-flowering' ('Annegret', 'Nicole', 'Wink 2-2006') and
three wild-type ('Karmina', 'Battle of Arnhem', 'Roter
Oktober') genotypes) were performed with 0.5 ng cDNA
(quantified via Qubit Fluorometer (Invitrogen)) on a
Stratagene MX3000P thermocycler (qPCR MxPro v4.01)
using the Absolute qPCR SYBR green ROX mix (ABgene).
Gene expression analysis was normalized vs. C. vulgaris
18S rRNA. ΔΔCt, i.e. the fold change was calculated
according to Ratio = 2-ΔΔCt [46], whereas the mean ΔCt of
the vegetative tissue was subtracted from the normalized
ΔCt-values of bracts, sepals and petals, respectively. Prior
to realtime PCR experiments, primer combinations were
tested for their optimum concentration, the prerequisite
of PCR-product-free non-template controls and for comparable amplification efficiencies according to common
methods [47,48]. The qRT-PCR products were additionally verified for length (electrophoretic separation) and
sequence (AGOWA GmbH) identity with the predicted
amplicons derived from different tissues and genotypes.
Estimation of nuclear genome size by flow cytometry
Fresh young foliage from samples and internal reference
standards (0.5 cm2 each) were co-chopped with a sharp
razor blade in a Petri dish containing 500 μL nuclei isolation buffer according to [49], supplemented with 1% polyvinylepyrrolidone 25, 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 μg/ml
RNAse and 50 μg/ml propidium iodide, incubated for at
least 30 sec and filtered through a 35 μm mesh. The relative fluorescence intensities of stained nuclei were measured on a FACStarPLUS (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA,
USA) equipped with an INNOVA 90-C argon laser
(Coherent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Propidium iodide was
excited at 514 nm and measured in FL1 channel using a
630 nm band-pass filter. At least three plants of each C.
vulgaris sample were used for absolute DNA content estimation together with Glycine max (L.) Merr. convar. max
var. max ('Cina 5202', 2C = 2.23 pg; Genebank Gatersleben, accession number: SOJA 392) as an internal standard. The nuclear DNA amount of the standard was
determined based on the value of 0.32 pg/2C for Arabidopsis thaliana 'Columbia' [50]. Usually 10,000 nuclei per
sample were analyzed. The absolute DNA amounts of the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/148

samples were calculated based on the values of the G1
peak means. ANOVA HSD Post-hoc test for unequal N,
which is a modification of the Tukey HSD test, was used
to determine significant differences between group means
(p = 0.05).
