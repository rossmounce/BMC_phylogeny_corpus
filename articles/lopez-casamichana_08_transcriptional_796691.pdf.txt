Abstract
Background: In eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells, homologous recombination is an accurate mechanism to generate
genetic diversity, and it is also used to repair DNA double strand-breaks. RAD52 epistasis group genes involved in
recombinational DNA repair, including mre11, rad50, nsb1/xrs2, rad51, rad51c/rad57, rad51b/rad55, rad51d, xrcc2, xrcc3,
rad52, rad54, rad54b/rdh54 and rad59 genes, have been studied in human and yeast cells. Notably, the RAD51
recombinase catalyses strand transfer between a broken DNA and its undamaged homologous strand, to allow damaged
region repair. In protozoan parasites, homologous recombination generating antigenic variation and genomic
rearrangements is responsible for virulence variation and drug resistance. However, in Entamoeba histolytica the
protozoan parasite responsible for human amoebiasis, DNA repair and homologous recombination mechanisms are still
unknown.
Results: In this paper, we initiated the study of the mechanism for DNA repair by homologous recombination in the
primitive eukaryote E. histolytica using UV-C (150 J/m2) irradiated trophozoites. DNA double strand-breaks were
evidenced in irradiated cells by TUNEL and comet assays and evaluation of the EhH2AX histone phosphorylation status.
In E. histolytica genome, we identified genes homologous to yeast and human RAD52 epistasis group genes involved in
DNA double strand-breaks repair by homologous recombination. Interestingly, the E. histolytica RAD52 epistasis group
related genes were differentially expressed before and after UV-C treatment. Next, we focused on the characterization
of the putative recombinase EhRAD51, which conserves the typical architecture of RECA/RAD51 proteins. Specific
antibodies immunodetected EhRAD51 protein in both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. Moreover, after DNA
damage, EhRAD51 was located as typical nuclear foci-like structures in E. histolytica trophozoites. Purified recombinant
EhRAD51 exhibited DNA binding and pairing activities and exchanging reactions between homologous strands in vitro.
Conclusion: E. histolytica genome contains most of the RAD52 epistasis group related genes, which were differentially
expressed when DNA double strand-breaks were induced by UV-C irradiation. In response to DNA damage, EhRAD51
protein is overexpressed and relocalized in nuclear foci-like structures. Functional assays confirmed that EhRAD51 is a
bonafide recombinase. These data provided the first insights about the potential roles of the E. histolytica RAD52 epistasis
group genes and EhRAD51 protein function in DNA damage response of this ancient eukaryotic parasite.

Background
Entamoeba histolytica, the protozoan causative of human
amoebiasis, has a world-wide distribution with a higher
prevalence in developing countries, affecting more than
50 million people each year [1]. Trophozoites show a dramatic virulence variability that could be related to great
genome plasticity [2]. Frequent ploidy changes, unscheduled gene amplification and duplication have been
reported [3,4], and it has been largely assumed that these
processes are linked to genetic rearrangements, although
no direct experimental evidence has been provided yet.
In eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells, homologous recombination (HR) is an accurate mechanism to generate genetic
diversity. HR is also used by cells to properly repair the
DNA double strand-breaks (DSBs). Generally, this kind of
damage is produced by genotoxic agents or during cellular
processes like meiotic division, telomere maintenance,
and restoration of collapsed replication forks in the course
of DNA synthesis [5-7]. Cellular response to DNA DSBs
activates a complex network of proteins that transiently
arrests cell cycle and enhances DNA repair mechanisms.
Particularly, Saccharomyces cerevisiae H2A and Homo sapiens H2AX histones are rapidly phosphorylated in the
chromatin micro-environment surrounding DNA DSBs,
inducing nucleosome remodeling to promote accumulation of checkpoint and DNA repair proteins at these sites
[8]. In case of extreme DNA damage, cells are targeted to
apoptosis [9]. Additionally, HR is also a useful tool to analyze gene function by gene targeting and gene knock out
approaches [10].
Molecular genetics of HR DNA repair has been well preserved throughout evolution. RAD52 epistasis group
genes involved in DNA DSB repair, including mre11,
rad50, nsb1/xrs2, rad51, rad51c/rad57, rad51b/rad55,
rad51d, xrcc2, xrcc3, rad52, rad54, rad54b/rdh54 and rad59
genes, have been identified in human and yeast cells [11].
Pivotal protein in HR pathway is the RAD51 recombinase,
which catalyses strand transfer between a broken DNA
and its undamaged homologous strand, allowing damaged region to be repaired [12]. Strand exchange reaction
is initiated by RAD51-coating of single-stranded DNA
(ssDNA) released from DSBs, to generate a nucleoprotein
filament. This active thread binds the intact doublestranded DNA (dsDNA) substrate, searching and locating
homologous sequences, and promoting DNA strand
exchange in an ATP-dependent manner, forming a heteroduplex structure called D-loop [13]. After DNA damage,
RAD51 protein has been observed in nuclear complexes
forming discrete foci, which are considered as the recombinational DNA repair sites [14].
HR remains the predominant mechanism to repair DSBs
in lower eukaryotes [15]. RAD51 proteins have been iden-

tified in Trypanosoma brucei and Plasmodium falciparum
parasites, which perform HR to switch the expression of
genes encoding surface membrane glycoproteins and generate antigenic variation [16-18]. Furthermore, recombinational rearrangements are responsible for amplification
of the multidrug resistance pfmdr1 gene in P. falciparum
[19], demonstrating the relevance of HR to generate
genomic versatility and plasticity in protozoan parasites.
In this paper, we identified and analyzed the mRNA
expression profile of E. histolytica RAD52 epistasis group
related genes in response to DNA damage. Additionally,
we presented experimental evidence of EhRAD51 function as a recombinase, which suggest its potential role in
DNA damage response. These findings constitute the initial efforts to understand the DNA repair mechanism in E.
histolytica that will contribute to the further elucidation of
events regulating genome integrity and variability in this
early-branch protozoan.

Results
High dose of UV-C light induces DNA fragmentation in
trophozoites
It has been shown in a wide variety of cells that X-rays
exposure, UV irradiation and chemicals activate cellular
responses to DNA repair [20]. To initiate the study of the
mechanisms involved in DNA repair in E. histolytica, we
used UV-C light irradiation to induce DNA damage in trophozoites. Our experiments showed that during the first
12 h after irradiation with 254 nm UV-C (150 J/m2), cell
survival was not significantly affected (Fig. 1A). Using the
same experimental conditions, we analyzed the presence
of 3'-hydroxyl DNA ends by TUNEL and FACS assays. In
untreated trophozoites, FACS analysis evidenced the presence of <1% TUNEL positive cells; meanwhile, 30 min
after treatment, 57.4 ± 2.74% of UV-C irradiated cells
showed DNA fragmentation (Fig. 1B, upper panels). DNA
damage reduction was observed at 3, 6 and 12 h after
treatment (27.11 ± 4.84, 8.79 ± 3.36 and 0.77 ± 2.59%,
respectively). Propidium iodide stained cells were
checked under the fluorescence microscope to confirm
the absence of cytoplasmic stain (Fig. 1B, lower panels).

The comet assay (single-cell gel electrophoresis) is widely
used to measure DNA damage and repair. Results
obtained through neutral comet assay (Fig. 1C) confirmed
the induction of DSBs in trophozoites by UV-C treatment.
Typical comet-like structures were observed at 30 min and
3 h, while a reduction of the DNA tails was observed at 6
h after UV-C treatment. As expected, 12 h after the genotoxic insult, DNA migration was similar to the control
untreated cells (No UV-C). Taking altogether, these data
indicated that UV-C irradiation efficiently induced DNA
damage and consequently, repair mechanisms were activated to restore DNA integrity allowing cell survival.

Early EhH2AX histone phosphorylation correlates with the
presence of DNA DSBs
DNA DSBs induce early phosphorylation of yeast H2A
(major H2A closer to mammalian H2AX) and human
H2AX histones on a conserved serine residue located in

the SQ motif at C terminus, producing γH2A and γH2AX,
respectively [21]. As in yeast, E. histolytica seems to have
replaced the canonical H2A with H2AX [22]. Two genes
(locus EHI_126210 and EHI_188960) that encode putative proteins with 55 and 57% identity (e-value 2e-27and

2e-28) to yeast H2A and human H2AX histones, respectively, were found in the E. histolytica genome. These genes
predict two 17.6 kDa conserved paralogous H2AX proteins that share 93% identity. Notably, both contain the
H2AX exclusive SQ motif with the potentially phosphorylable serine residue (S156) (Fig. 2A).
Taking advantage of the high conservation between H.
sapiens and E. histolytica H2AX C-terminus, we performed
Western blot assays using the anti-human γH2AX antibody to detect serine-phosphorylated EhH2AX homologues (γEhH2AX) in cytoplasmic (CE) and nuclear (NE)
extracts of trophozoites. Protein amount and integrity
were confirmed on Coomassie blue stained-gels (data not
shown). In NE from non-irradiated cells, we identified a
17-kDa weak band, which corresponds to the expected
molecular weight of γEhH2AX histones (Fig. 2B, lane 2).
Interestingly, 10 min after UV-C irradiation, this band was
five-fold more intense, suggesting an increase in the
amount of nuclear γEhH2AX, and 30 min after treatment
no band was found (Fig. 2B, lanes 4 and 6). However,
these assays did not allow us to distinguish whether one
or both EhH2AX proteins were phosphorylated. In contrast, no signals were observed in CE (Fig. 2B, lanes 1, 3
and 5). We used as an integrity control an anti-EhPAP
serum, which recognized the 63-kDa EhPAP protein [23]
in non-irradiated and irradiated trophozoites (Fig. 2B,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/9/35

middle panel). In addition, an anti-actin monoclonal
antibody, used as control for cell fractionation, strongly
detected the expected 42-kDa band in CE and a slight signal in NE, as expected for a major component of cytoskeleton (Fig. 2B, lower panel). These data showed that UV-C
irradiation of trophozoites is a useful model to generate
DNA DSBs and study DNA repair in E. histolytica.
E. histolytica genome contains RAD52 epistasis group
related genes
In order to investigate the presence of RAD52 epistasis
group related genes in E. histolytica genome, we surveyed
the parasite Pathema database (Table 1). We found
Ehmre11, Ehrad50 and Ehnbs1 genes, which could encode
the E. histolytica putative MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 protein
complex that functions as the primary sensor of DNA
DSBs in other organisms [9]. Both EhMRE11 and
EhRAD50 proteins exhibited 32 to 23% identities (e-values from 3e-49 to 9e-36) with S. cerevisiae and H. sapiens
orthologous proteins, respectively; whereas the EhNBS1
sequence appears to be more divergent (17 to 24% identity and e-values from 0.003 to 0.002). E. histolytica also
contains genes encoding the putative recombinase
EhRAD51 and its paralogous protein EhRAD51C.
EhRAD52, EhRAD54, EhRAD54B and EhRAD59
(EhRAD52/22 in Pathema database) predicted proteins
are also encoded in the E. histolytica genome. As in yeast,

rad51 paralogs (rad51b, rad51d, xrcc2 and xrcc3) that participate in HR in vertebrates were not found in E. histolytica (Table 1). In conclusion, E. histolytica genome contains
a conserved set of repair genes, which suggests that it is
skilled to perform recombinational DNA repair.
E. histolytica genes of the RAD52 epistasis group are
differentially expressed in response to UV-C irradiation
As a first step towards establishing the role of the E. histolytica RAD52 epistasis group related genes, we evaluated
their mRNA expression by semi-quantitative RT-PCR
using the UV-C irradiation model described above. Most
genes exhibited a differential mRNA expression profile
before and after irradiation (Fig. 3). Ehmre11, Ehrad51,
Ehrad51c and Ehrad52 genes were transcribed at a very low
level in non-irradiated trophozoites; meanwhile mRNA
expression was induced from 30 min to 12 h after genotoxic damage. Particularly, the Ehrad51 mRNA expression
was 16-, 11- and 4-fold increased at 30 min, 3 h and 12 h,
respectively, after UV-C irradiation, when compared with
untreated cells (Fig. 3A and 3B). On the other hand, the
Ehnbs1, Ehrad54 and Ehrad59 genes were abundantly transcribed in untreated trophozoites; however, mRNA levels
were down-regulated after UV-C treatment. The Ehrad50
gene expression showed the highest steady-state mRNA
levels in non-irradiated trophozoites. At 30 min after UVC irradiation, Ehrad50 transcript levels dropped drastically; 3 h later, they moderately increased, and at 12 h they
diminished again. In contrast, Ehrad54b gene did not
seem to be expressed under the experimental conditions
tested here (Fig. 3A and 3B). We observed minimal
changes in the 25S rRNA expression used as control (Fig.
3A, lower panel). These data showed that E. histolytica

RAD52 epistasis group related genes were differentially
expressed in response to DNA damage.
The predicted EhRAD51 conserves the typical architecture
of RECA/RAD51 family members
Since RAD51 recombinases are considered as key enzymes
in HR and DNA repair processes in many organisms [24],
we focused on the characterization of the E. histolytica
EhRAD51 protein. Ehrad51 is an intron-less 1101 bp gene,
which encodes a 367 amino acids (aa) polypeptide (40.3kDa). Sequence similarity searches by BLAST showed the
lowest e-values (from 3e-29 to 2e-20) and high identity
(from 59 to 75%) with many eukaryotic RAD51 proteins,
from plants to human, including protozoan parasites.
Moreover, EhRAD51 showed 51% and 36% identity with
Methanococcus voltae RADA and Escherichia coli RECA bacterial recombinases, respectively (Additional file 1).
Amino acid sequence alignment of EhRAD51 protein
with yeast and human RAD51 orthologs revealed that
these proteins share functional and structural conserved
motifs (Fig. 4A). EhRAD51 contains the putative polymerization motif (110–113 aa residues), which tethers individual subunits to form quaternary assemblies in human
RAD51 protein [24] (Additional file 2). We also identified
the ATPase Walker A or phosphate binding loop (P-loop:
152–159 aa residues) and Walker B motifs (240–249 aa
residues), the ssDNA binding loops L1 (255–264 aa residues) and L2 (293–311 aa residues), as well as the ATPstacking motif or ATP cap (342–350 aa residues) at the Cterminus, which are essential for nucleofilament assembling and ATP hydrolysis in RAD51/RECA-like recombinases [26,27]. Remarkably, the EhRAD51 N-terminus has
a low-complexity region of 34-aa highly enriched in
glutamic residues, which is not present in homologous

proteins (Fig. 4A). Phylogenetic relationships among
EhRAD51 and RAD51/RECA related proteins from diverse
organisms, revealed a progressive evolution from eubacteria to eukaryotes, being EhRAD51 more related to protozoan recombinases (Fig. 4B).
The EhRAD51 protein is overexpressed in response to DNA
damage
The recombinant EhRAD51 protein (rEhRAD51) was
expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) plysS strain as a 6x Histagged fusion polypeptide and subsequently purified by
affinity chromatography (Fig. 5A, lanes 3 and 4). By Western blot assays using monoclonal anti-6xHis tag antibodies, the purified rEhRAD51 was detected as a single 47
kDa band, which was slightly higher than the 44.1 kDa
expected weight (Fig. 5B, lane 2). Then, rEhRAD51 was
used to generate rabbit polyclonal anti-EhRAD51 antibodies. These antibodies recognized the 47 kDa

rEhRAD51 band (Fig. 5B, lane 4), whereas the preimmune serum, used as negative control, did not detect any
signal (Fig. 5B, lane 3). To evaluate the expression of the
native EhRAD51 in E. histolytica, we performed Western
blot assays using anti-EhRAD51 antibodies and protein
extracts from irradiated and non-irradiated trophozoites.
Antibodies reacted with a weak 46 kDa band in CE from
non treated trophozoites, but not signal was detected in
NE (Fig. 5C, higher panel, lanes 1 and 2). Meanwhile, at
30 min after UV-C irradiation, antibodies strongly
detected the expected 41 kDa endogenous EhRAD51 in
CE, but not in NE (Fig. 5C, higher panel lanes 3 and 4).
Intriguingly, antibodies also detected a 46 kDa band in
both NE and CE from UV-C irradiated trophozoites,
which may correspond to a modified form of the 41 kDa
protein. The specificity of anti-EhRAD51 antibodies was
confirmed performing a similar Western blot assay using
anti-EhRAD51 antibodies previously pre-incubated with

purified rEhRAD51 protein and the recognition of both
46 and 41 kDa proteins was specifically inhibited (data
not shown). In addition, the use of anti-EhPAP and antiactin antibodies confirmed protein integrity and cell fractionation of CE and NE (Fig. 5C, middle and lower panels). Our findings showed that EhRAD51 was
overexpressed in response to UV-C irradiation, and distributed in both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments.

EhRAD51 relocalizes into nuclear foci-like structures in
response to DNA damage
In order to better characterize the EhRAD51 expression
and function, we investigated its subcellular location in
trophozoites through immunofluorescence and laser confocal microscopy. In agreement with the Western blot
results, EhRAD51 was detected at low levels in the cytosol
of non-irradiated trophozoites (Fig. 6, panels A-D),
whereas at 30 min after UV-C irradiation we noted a dramatic accumulation of cytoplasmic EhRAD51 protein.
Interestingly, we also observed a scattered distribution of
EhRAD51 typical foci-like structures in the nucleus (Fig. 6,

panels E-H). Three hours later, the cytoplasmic signal
diminished, while nuclear foci-like structures remained
(Fig. 6, panels I-L). At 12 h after genotoxic damage, both
cytoplasmic and nuclear EhRAD51 signals were very
weak, being EhRAD51 foci-like structures scarce (Fig. 6,
panels M-P). Quantification of nuclear foci like-structures
by statistical microscopic analysis showed that about 60%
of the cells contained at least one focus at 30 min after UVC irradiation (Fig. 6Q). These findings confirmed that
EhRAD51 was up-regulated after UV-C irradiation and
suggested that it was redistributed into the nucleus during
the first 3 h after DNA damage.
rEhRAD51 exhibits DNA binding activity in vitro
In silico analysis of the EhRAD51 aa sequence evidenced
the presence of two putative DNA binding domains. To
verify that EhRAD51 is a DNA binding protein, we performed EMSA using increasing amounts of purified
rEhRAD51 protein and a fixed concentration of radiolabeled 50-bp ssDNA or 270-bp dsDNA fragments as
probes. In order to discard interactions of contaminant E.

coli proteins with DNA probes, we used mock purified
fractions obtained from untransformed bacteria as a negative control. Results showed that incubation of
rEhRAD51 with ssDNA and dsDNA probes resulted in five
DNA-protein complexes (CI-CV) formation, suggesting
that alternative populations of RAD51 protomers were
associated to each DNA probes (Fig. 7A and 7B, lanes 2 to
4). The fastest migration ssDNA-protein complex CI that
was also formed with the mock fraction was considered as
unspecific (Fig. 7A, lanes 5 to 7). No complexes were
formed in the EMSA control performed with the dsDNA
probe (Fig. 7B, lanes 5 to 7). Notably, the abundance of
slow migration DNA-protein complexes appeared to
increase in the presence of the highest rEhRAD51 amount
(Fig. 7A and 7B, lanes 2 to 4). These results showed that
rEhRAD51 was able to efficiently bind both ssDNA and
dsDNA substrates in vitro.

rEhRAD51 exhibits homologous DNA strand transfer
activity in vitro
In order to evaluate the homologous DNA strand transfer
function of the rEhRAD51 protein, we performed a pairing assay involving the D-loop structure formation as
described in Experimental procedures. Results revealed
that rEhRAD51 was able to shift the electrophoretic
mobility of the radioactive-labeled 200-bp ssDNA probe
incubated with homologous circular dsDNA (Fig. 7C,
lanes 2 to 4). This indicated that rEhRAD51 was able to
catalyze ssDNA transfer to homologous dsDNA forming
the three-stranded pairing molecule or D-loop structure,
which has a reduced electrophoretic mobility in comparison with the ssDNA probe. The D-loop formation specificity was confirmed by incubation of rEhRAD51 and
ssDNA probe in the absence of homologous dsDNA sub-

strate (Fig. 7C, lane 5), and in the presence of a heterologous dsDNA substrate (Fig. 7C, lane 6), since no complex
was observed. In addition, we did not observe any D-loop
structure in the absence of rEhRAD51 (Fig. 7C, lane 1).
Densitometric analysis of radioactive products showed
that D-loop structure formation using 7.5 μg of
rEhRAD51 was 3.6 and 1.7-fold higher than with 2.5 and
5 μg of rEhRAD51, respectively (Fig. 7D). These results
indicated that EhRAD51 protein was able to catalyze specific DNA paring and exchange between DNA homologous strands in vitro.

Discussion
While non-homologous end joining plays a major role in
DSB DNA repair in higher eukaryotes including mammals, HR remains the predominant mechanism to repair

this kind of lesions in lower eukaryotes [15]. The high
amount of repetitive DNA in protozoan parasites, such as
E. histolytica, suggests that the genome of these organisms
can be potentially recombinogenic. Therefore, the study
of HR process in E. histolytica may advance our understanding about trophozoites genetic and virulence variability, as well as DNA repair mechanisms.
Here, we developed a 254 nm UV-C light irradiation
model, which induces DNA damage in E. histolytica trophozoites and activates recombinational DNA repair
pathway. Irradiation dose (150 J/m2) and time (8 s) were
determined as no lethal conditions for cells in comparison with other UV doses previously evaluated. Growth
curves were performed up to 18 h, the doubling time of
trophozoites, without observing any significant changes
(data not shown). Early phosphorylation of E. histolytica
H2AX histones after UV-C irradiation was consistent with
DNA DSBs formation, suggesting chromatin remodeling
and recruitment of histone-phosphorylating enzymes, as
observed in other eukaryotic systems [22]. Moreover, E
histolytica trophozoites survival throughout almost 12 h
after irradiation indicated the existence and activation of
DNA repair mechanisms. In silico analysis of the E. histolytica genome sequence revealed that this pathogen has
genes that encode putative EhRAD52 epistasis group
members, which participate in recombinational DNA
repair in other organims. Given the place of this ancient
protista in the eukaryote phylogenetic scale, EhRAD52
epistasis group had equivalent similarity with homologous proteins from different organisms, such as mammals, plants and other protozoan parasites.
RT-PCR assays evidenced a differential mRNA expression
of E. histolytica rad52 epistasis group genes, before and
after DNA damage. Some genes (Ehnbs1, Ehrad54 and
Ehrad52/22) were down-regulated after DNA damage,
others (Ehmre11, Ehrad51, Ehrad51-C and Ehrad52) were
up-regulated at different times following genotoxic stimulus, whereas Ehrad50 mRNA levels were regulated in a variable manner, suggesting a complex transcriptional
response. Interestingly, Ehrad54b gene did not seem to be
transcribed under our experimental conditions. However,
in yeast and human, both RAD54 and RAD54B are DNA
helicases which participate in the formation of heteroduplex DNA in recombination processes [11]. It is possible
that the expression of Ehrad54 homolog is sufficient to
cover this activity in trophozoites, although additional
experiments are required to confirm this hypothesis. The
absence of a coordinated transcriptional activation of
Ehrad52 epistasis group genes suggest that trophozoites
have enough stationary levels of enzymes for DBB repair
and the main regulation could be occurring at translational and/or posttranslational level. A further evaluation
of EhRAD52 epistasis group proteins regulation in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/9/35

response to DNA damage will help us to better understand DNA repair by HR in E. histolytica. It seems that the
molecular events related to DNA lesions produced by genotoxic agents can be barely inferred from gene expression
profiling. Indeed, studies in yeast and mammals have
shown no-relationship between genes whose expression
is increased after different DNA-damaging treatments
(ionizing radiation, UV light, cisplatin, H2O2) and those
genes that are involved in protecting against cytotoxicity
to the same agents [28,29].
We focused on Ehrad51 gene because RAD51 proteins
have been demonstrated as key players in recombinational DNA repair in lower and higher eukaryotes [for
review see [12]]. Interestingly, the Ehrad51 transcript
steady state levels were about 15-fold higher at 30 min
post-UV-C treatment and decreased 3 and 12 h later, suggesting that EhRAD51 could be participating in HR in the
early steps of DNA repair. Similar transcriptional activation after UV treatment has been reported as a common
characteristic for recA/rad51 homologs of Tetrahymena
thermophila [30] and Halobacterium sp. [31]. In agreement
with the RT-PCR results, Western blot assays showed a
dramatic increase of EhRAD51 in cytoplasm and nucleus,
30 min after DNA breaks were introduced into the E. histolytica genome. The fact that specific polyclonal antibodies immunodetected a 46 kDa EhRAD51 protein suggest
that some posttranslational modifications of the cytoplasmic 41 kDa EhRAD51 could be a requirement for its translocation to the nucleus where DNA repair takes place.
Taking in consideration that the EhRAD51 sequence lacks
a nuclear localization signal, an alternative possibility
might be that EhRAD51 needs to interact with other protein(s) to be transported inside the nucleus. However,
additional experiments are required to corroborate these
hypotheses.
As observed for yeast and human homologs [32], laser
confocal microscopy evidenced focal sites of the
EhRAD51 protein scattered in the nucleus at 30 min and
3 h after DNA damage. Congruently, the EhRAD51
nuclear foci-like structure occurrence was consistent with
the DNA fragmentation degree observed in TUNEL and
neutral comet assays. Since UV-C treatment did not affect
trophozoites viability, it is tempting to suggest that DNA
repair mechanisms involving EhRAD51 foci formation
were activated to restore genome integrity after genotoxic
insult.
In silico analysis demonstrated that the predicted
EhRAD51 protein contains all functional and structural
motifs that are important for RECA/RAD51 recombinases
activities. To experimentally support its role in DNA repair
by HR, we performed the basic characterization of
EhRAD51 protein. EhRAD51 functional properties were

similar to those previously reported for RAD51 homologous [33-35]. EhRAD51 was able to bind both ssDNA and
dsDNA substrates in the presence of ATP and Mg2+. The
various rEhRAD51-DNA complexes may be related to different amounts of rEhRAD51 molecules bound to ssDNA
or dsDNA probe. Finally, EhRAD51 promoted specific
three-stranded pairing structure formation or D-loop.
Based on the data presented here, we proposed a working
model for DNA DSB repair involving the EhRAD51
recombinase. When a DSB is introduced in E. histolytica
genome, EhH2AX histones become phosphorylated,
which could induce chromatin remodeling and accumulation of the EhRAD52 epistasis group proteins at the
DNA DSB site. We observed that EhRAD51 was relocated
into the DNA repair nuclear foci, where it could mediate
DNA paring and homologous strand exchange to restore
genome integrity. It is also possible that E. histolytica
RAD51 protein may play a role in genome rearrangements
that naturally occur within this organism during DNA
synthesis. Therefore, it will be interesting to evaluate its
involvement in frequent ploidy changes, unscheduled
gene amplification and duplication events observed in E.
histolytica genome [3,4]. Our next challenge will involve
studying in vivo HR and the relevant role of EhRAD51 in
this process in E. histolytica.

Conclusion
Our results provide the first data supporting the role of the
RAD52 epistasis group genes in DNA repair process in E.
histolytica. We showed that E. histolytica RAD52 epistasis
group genes, were differentially expressed when DNA
fragmentation was induced by UV-C irradiation. We also
showed that EhRAD51 protein was overexpressed and
relocalized in nuclear foci-like structures after DNA damage, and demonstrated that recombinant EhRAD51 function as a recombinase in vitro. These data evidenced a
potential role of EhRAD51 protein in DNA damage
response in this ancient eukaryotic parasite.

Methods
E. histolytica cultures
Trophozoites of E. histolytica clone A (strain HM1: IMSS)
were axenically cultured in TYI-S-33 medium [36] at 37°C
and harvested during exponential growth phase.
Trophozoites UV-C light irradiation
Trophozoites (2 × 106) grown in culture bottles were
transferred into glass dishes and incubated at 37°C for 30
min. Medium and floating cells were discarded, and
adhered trophozoites were irradiated with 254 nm UV-C
light at 150 J/m2 for 8 s using a UV Stratalinker 1800
device (Stratagene). After treatment, cells were incubated
in fresh TYI-S-33 medium at 37°C for 0.5, 3, 6 and 12 h
to be used in different experiments. Non-irradiated cells
were used as a control in all experiments. Cell viability

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/9/35

was monitored by microscopy using a trypan blue dye
exclusion test. Assays were done three times by duplicate.
Evaluation of DNA fragmentation by TUNEL assay
Trophozoites (2 × 106) were harvested at 0.5, 3, 6 and 12
h after UV-C irradiation, washed with PBS 1× and fixed
with 1% paraformaldehyde. After cell permeabilization
with 70% ethanol, DNA damage was quantified using the
APO-BrdUTP TUNEL Assay Kit (Molecular Probes) in
order to detect 3'-hydroxyl ends in DNA. Permeabilized
trophozoites were incubated at 37°C for 1 h in the DNAlabeling solution, which contains terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase enzyme (TdT) and deoxythymidine analog
5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate (BrdUTP).
Then, cells were washed twice and suspended in antibody
staining solution (Alexa Fluor 488 dye-labeled anti-BrdU
antibody) at room temperature for 1 h. After that, cells
were incubated in propidium iodide/RNase A staining
buffer at room temperature for 30 min. Samples were analyzed by flow cytometry in a BD FACS Calibur system and
fluorescence data were plotted with the FloJo software.
Evaluation of DNA fragmentation by Comet assay
Trophozoites (5 × 104) were harvested at 0.5, 3, 6 and 12
h after UV-C irradiation. Neutral comet assay were performed using protocols from Tice and co-workers [37].
Briefly, cells were mixed with agarose and spread over a
warmed, precoated microscope slides. Agarose was
allowed to solidify at 4°C, followed by immersion in cold
lysis fresh solution (2.5 M NaCl, 100 mM EDTA, 10 mM
Tris, pH 7) overnight. Next, electrophoresis was carried
out in neutral buffer for 20 min at 1.5 V/cm (measured
electrode to electrode) in the dark at 4°C. Finally, the
slides were completely dried and ethidium bromidestained DNA was observed at 400× magnification using
an epifluorescence microscope (Leica DMIL).
Detection of phosphorylated EhH2AX histones
The two Ehh2ax genes, which are homologous to the
human h2ax gen, had been previously reported [22]. Their
existence in the E. histolytica Pathema database [38] were
confirmed by BLAST using yeast H2A and human H2AX
protein sequences as queries. The presence of phosphorylated forms of EhH2AX histone (γEhH2AX) in E. histolytica protein extracts obtained 10 or 30 min after UV-C
irradiation was evaluated by Western blot assays using the
anti-phospho-Histone H2AX (pSer139), which was developed in rabbit using a synthetic phosphorylated peptide
corresponding to 134–142 aa residues (including the
phosphorylated Ser) of human H2AX histone C-terminus
(Sigma). Subcellular fractionation to obtain CE and NE
from clone A trophozoites was performed as described
[39]. Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (BioRad) and blocked
with 1% BSA/PBS solution. Then, filters were incubated at

room temperature for 2 h with the anti-human γH2AX
polyclonal antibody (1:7000 dilution), washed with PBS
1× 0.05%Tween and incubated at 37°C for 1 h with goat
anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody (Zymed) at 1:10000 dilution. Bands were revealed
by ECL Plus Western blotting system (Amersham). As
internal controls, we used polyclonal antibodies (1:1000
dilution) raised against the E. histolytica poly(A) polymerase EhPAP and anti-actin antibodies.
In silico identification of E. histolytica genes homologous
to yeast RAD52 epistasis group
RAD52 epistasis group related genes were identified in E.
histolytica Pathema database using both yeast and human
protein sequences as queries. Putative E. histolytica orthologous proteins were selected from BLAST analysis according to the following criteria: (i) at least 20% identity and
35% homology to the query sequence; (ii) e-value lower
than 0.002; and (iii) absence of stop codons in the coding
sequence. Predicted aa sequences were aligned by the
ClustalW software [40]. Functional domains were predicted by the Prosite program [41]. Phylogenetic inference
was performed using the Neighbor-joining distance
method [42] as implemented in the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA version 3.1) software [43].
Tree robustness was established by bootstrapping test,
involving 1000 replications of the data based on the criteria of 50% majority-rule consensus.
RT-PCR assays
Total RNA was obtained using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen)
from trophozoites of clone A grown in basal culture conditions or after UV-C treatment. Semi-quantitative RTPCR was performed as previously described [44] using 1
μg of total RNA and specific primers for each gene (Table
2). As a control, we amplified a 25S rRNA gene internal
sequence. Products were separated by 6% PAGE, stained
with ethidium bromide and submitted to densitometric
analysis in a Gel doc 1000 apparatus (BioRad) using the

Quantity One software. Data are the mean of three independent assays.
Cloning of the Ehrad51 gene
The 1098-bp full-length Ehrad51 gene was PCR-amplified
from genomic DNA of clone A trophozoites using
Ehrad51-S (5'-CGGGATCCAAAGTAATGAG TGCCAA
GCA-3') sense and Ehrad51-AS (5'-CCAAGCTTGCCATTCTCC GTATTATGGC-3') antisense primers, which contain BamHI and HindIII restriction sites, respectively
(underlined). Amplification was performed as follows:
94°C for 5 min and 30 cycles at 94°Cfor35s,48°C for 35 s
and 72°C for 1 min, plus a final extension step at 72°C for
7 min, using High Fidelity DNA Taq polymerase (Invitrogen). The PCR product was purified and cloned in frame
into the pRSET A expression vector (Invitrogen). The
recombinant pRSET -Ehrad51 plasmid construct was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing in an ABI-PRISM
310 (Applied Biosystem) sequencer.
Expression and purification of recombinant EhRAD51
(rEhRAD51) protein
E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS bacteria were transformed with
pRSET -Ehrad51 plasmid and grown at 37°C in 2-TY
medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml
chloramphenicol to an OD600nm of 0.6. The expression of
rEhRAD51 was induced with 1 mM isopropyl beta-D-thiogalacto pyranoside (IPTG) at 37°C for 3 h. Cells were
harvested, resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4,
300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, pH 8.0) and lysed by
sonication at 4°C. Soluble rEhRAD51 was purified near to
homogeneity under denaturing and native conditions
through Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography according to
the manufacturer recommendations (Qiagen). Purified
rEhRAD51 identity and integrity were confirmed by 10%
SDS-PAGE and Western blot assays using anti-6xHis tag
antibodies (Roche) at 1:5000 dilution and the ECL Plus
Western blotting detection system (Amersham).

Production of polyclonal antibodies raised against
EhRAD51
Purified rEhRAD51 was submitted to preparative 10%
SDS-PAGE, electroeluted from Coomassie stained-gels
and subsequently used as antigen to immunize a New
Zeland male rabbit. An initial dose of 200 μg of
rEhRAD51 in complete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma) was
subcutaneously inoculated into the animal, and then
three doses of 100 μg in incomplete Freund's adjuvant
were injected every 15 days. One week after the last immunization, the rabbit was bled and polyclonal antiserum
was obtained. IgGs were purified through protein G
sepharose chromatography and tested for reactivity
against rEhRAD51 protein by Western blot assays.
Immunodetection of EhRAD51 in subcellular extracts
Western blot assays were performed using CE and NE proteins obtained before or 30 min after UV-C irradiation,
and the membranes were incubated with anti-EhRAD51
polyclonal antibodies (1:1000 dilution) and goat antirabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody
(Zymed)(1:10000 dilution). Immunodetected proteins
were revealed with the ECL Plus Western blotting system
(Amersham). The specificity of the anti-EhRAD51 antibodies was confirmed using anti-EhRAD51 antibodies
pre-incubated with purified rEhRAD51 protein. As internal controls, we used polyclonal antibodies raised against
the E. histolytica EhPAP [23] and actin proteins.
Laser confocal microscopy assays
Trophozoites were grown on sterile coverslips, fixed with
4% paraformaldehyde at 37°C for 1 h, permeabilized
with acetone and blocked with 1% BSA/PBS. Next, cells
were incubated with anti-EhRAD51 polyclonal antibodies
(1:200 dilution) at 37°C for 2 h, followed by the anti-rabbit fluoresceinated monoclonal antibody (1:100 dilution)
at 37°C for 1 h. Then, trophozoites were washed three
times with PBS 1× at room temperature and DNA was
counterstained with propidium iodide (5 μg/ml) for 7
min. Light optical sections were obtained through a
Nikon inverted microscope attached to a laser confocal
scanning system (Leica) and analyzed by Confocal Assistant software Image J [45].
DNA-binding assays
For the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), we
used two DNA probes: a 50-nt ss oligonucleotide (adh50)
from the Ehadh112 gene [46], which was [γ-32P]dATP
(500 μCi/mmol) 3'-end labeled by T4 polynucleotide
kinase at 37°C for 30 min, and a 270-bp dsDNA fragment
(pgp270) of the 3'-UTR EhPgp5 gene [50] that was [α32P]dATP (200 μCi/mmol) uniformly labeled by PCR.
EMSA was carried out in a 25 μl final volume reaction in
binding buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.8, 1 mM DTT, 10
mM MgCl2, 1 mM ATP) in the presence of increasing

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/9/35

amounts of native rEhRAD51 (0, 2.5, 5 and 7.5 μg). Reactions were started by addition of adh50 or pgp270 radiolabeled probes (10000 cpm) at 37°C for 15 min. Control
assays were performed substituting purified rEhRAD51 by
the mock purified fraction obtained from untransformed
bacteria. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on 6%
non-denaturing TBE polyacrylamide gels, vacuum-dried
and exposed to Phosphor Imager screen (BioRad).
D-loop structure formation assay
The EhRAD51 homologous DNA strand transfer activity
was evaluated by the D-loop formation assay according to
the described procedure [47]. A ssDNA fragment of 200
bases (pgp200), which is complementary to the 3'-UTR
Ehpgp5 gene cloned in the dsDNA plasmid [44], was [γ32P]dATP (500 μCi/mmol) 3'-end labeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase at 37°C for 30 min. Increasing amounts of
rEhRAD51 (0, 2.5, 5 and 7.5 μg) were pre-incubated in
reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.8, 1 mM DTT, 10
mM MgCl2 and 1 mM ATP) with the pgp200 probe
(10,000 cpm) at 37°C for 15 min. Then, homologous
dsDNA plasmid (1 μM) was added and the mixture was
incubated at 37°C for 30 min. A non-related plasmid was
used as heterologous dsDNA control. Reactions were
stopped by addition of 0.1% SDS. To prevent that
EhRAD51 binds and shifts the pgp200 probe, samples
were deproteinized with proteinase K (1 mg/ml) at 37°C
for 10 min. Then, they were fractionated by 1% agarose
gel electrophoresis in TAE 1× buffer and transferred to a
nylon membrane (Amersham) in SSC 20× solution overnight. Homologous DNA strand transfer activity of
rEhRAD51 was evaluated through the visualization of
radioactive DNA products in a Phosphor Imager (BioRad)
and quantified by densitometry using the Quantity one
software (BioRad).

Predictions of EhRAD51 tertiary structure using the Swiss Model software
and the yeast RAD51 protein crystal structure (PDB entry 1szp) as template. A. Predicted three-dimensional model of EhRAD51 protein showing
the N-terminal domain (ND) constituted by a five-α helix bundle (α1 to
α5) and an ATPase domain (AD) conformed by a twisted central β-sheet,
which includes 10 β strands sandwiched by α-helices on both sides connected by a polymerization motif (PM). B. ATPase Walker A motif lies
between β1 and α8 and conserves the catalytic lysine (K160) and threonine (T160) residues, which are associated to ATP γ-phosphate contact
and Mg2+ ion stabilization, respectively, in homologous proteins. Walker
B motif lies on β4 and precedes α12 and the disordered DNA-binding
loop 1. ATP cap is in close proximity to an ATP molecule. EhRAD51
DNA-binding loop 2 is formed by two inter-connected β strands (β6 and
β7). C. Three-dimensional representation of Polymerization motif (PM).
Critical conserved residues conforming PM in helix 6 are shown. Key
motifs were colored as follow: violet, PM; red, ATPase Walker A; green,
Walker B; blue, ATP cap; yellow, Loop 1 and purple, Loop 2. Models were
displayed and refined using the Pymol PBD viewer.
