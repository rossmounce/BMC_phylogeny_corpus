Abstract
Background: Pythium species are an agriculturally important genus of plant pathogens, yet are not
understood well at the molecular, genetic, or genomic level. They are closely related to other
oomycete plant pathogens such as Phytophthora species and are ubiquitous in their geographic
distribution and host rage. To gain a better understanding of its gene complement, we generated
Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) from the transcriptome of Pythium ultimum DAOM BR144 (=
ATCC 200006 = CBS 805.95) using two high throughput sequencing methods, Sanger-based chain
termination sequencing and pyrosequencing-based sequencing-by-synthesis.
Results: A single half-plate pyrosequencing (454 FLX) run on adapter-ligated cDNA from a
normalized cDNA population generated 90,664 reads with an average read length of 190
nucleotides following cleaning and removal of sequences shorter than 100 base pairs. After
clustering and assembly, a total of 35,507 unique sequences were generated. In parallel, 9,578 reads
were generated from a library constructed from the same normalized cDNA population using
dideoxy chain termination Sanger sequencing, which upon clustering and assembly generated 4,689
unique sequences. A hybrid assembly of both Sanger- and pyrosequencing-derived ESTs resulted in
34,495 unique sequences with 1,110 sequences (3.2%) that were solely derived from Sanger
sequencing alone. A high degree of similarity was seen between P. ultimum sequences and other
sequenced plant pathogenic oomycetes with 91% of the hybrid assembly derived sequences > 500
bp having similarity to sequences from plant pathogenic Phytophthora species. An analysis of Gene
Ontology assignments revealed a similar representation of molecular function ontologies in the
hybrid assembly in comparison to the predicted proteomes of three Phytophthora species,
suggesting a broad representation of the P. ultimum transcriptome was present in the normalized
cDNA population. P. ultimum sequences with similarity to oomycete RXLR and Crinkler effectors,
Kazal-like and cystatin-like protease inhibitors, and elicitins were identified. Sequences with

similarity to thiamine biosynthesis enzymes that are lacking in the genome sequences of three
Phytophthora species and one downy mildew were identified and could serve as useful phylogenetic
markers. Furthermore, we identified 179 candidate simple sequence repeats that can be used for
genotyping strains of P. ultimum.
Conclusion: Through these two technologies, we were able to generate a robust set (~10 Mb) of
transcribed sequences for P. ultimum. We were able to identify known sequences present in
oomycetes as well as identify novel sequences. An ample number of candidate polymorphic
markers were identified in the dataset providing resources for phylogenetic and diagnostic marker
development for this species. On a technical level, in spite of the depth possible with 454 FLX
platform, the Sanger and pyro-based sequencing methodologies were complementary as each
method generated sequences unique to each platform.

Background
Pythium species are ubiquitous fungal-like organisms in
the Kingdom Straminipila. They are related to the oomycete plant pathogens Phytophthora and downy mildews
(e.g. Bremia, Peronospora, and Plasmopora) in the Peronosporales and to Saprolegnia and Aphanomyces in the Saprolegniales. They differ from the true fungi (Eumycota) in
that they are diploid, have coenocytic hyphae containing
β-1–3 glucans and cellulose in their cell walls, reproduce
sexually by fertilization of oogonia by antheridia and, in
many species, form motile, biflagellate zoospores. Nevertheless, Pythium species have many similarities to true
fungi in the way they obtain nutrients from the environment or attack plants [1].
The genus Pythium is biologically and ecologically diverse.
Although approximately 250 Pythium species have been
described, only half that number has been recognized as
valid descriptions [2-4]. Pythium species have been
divided into 11 phylogenetic clades based on rDNA ITS
and other sequence data [3]. Most are soil inhabitants
although some reside in salt water estuaries and other
aquatic environments. Most Pythium species are saprophytic or facultative plant pathogens [4]. They are among
the most important plant pathogens and cause a variety of
diseases including seed rots and damping-off, root, stem
and fruit rots, foliar blights and postharvest decay [5-8]. A
few non-phytopathogenic species show promise as biological control agents [9]. Other Pythium species are parasites of insects [10] and fish [4] and at least one species (P.
insidiosum) can infect animals and causes skin and bone
lesions in pigs, dogs, and humans [11].
Pythium ultimum is a cosmopolitan plant pathogen with a
broad host range. It is one of the most pathogenic Pythium
species on corn, soybean, wheat, ornamentals, and many
other crops [9]. It is homothallic, and in most cases, self
fertile, although some outcrossing may occur [12]. P. ultimum is actually a species complex with three main morphological types. P. ultimum var. ultimum, the most
common type, produces oospores but very rarely spor-

angia and zoospores, and then only at cool temperatures
[4]. It is part of a large uniform clade based on rDNA ITS
sequence comparisons which includes the neotype strain
[3] as well as the isolate used to generate the Expressed
Sequence Tags (ESTs) in this study. P. ultimum var. sporangiiferum produces oospores and sporangia at room temperature [4]. In Barr et al. [13], the four P. ultimum var.
sporangiiferum isolates formed a unique genotype (U6)
based on isozyme analysis whereas in Francis et al. [12]
the two isolates of this variety were in two distinct genotypes, one belonging to the most common genotype of P.
ultimum var. ultimum strains. It is unclear at this point
whether or not the more infrequent but unique genotypes
of P. ultimum such as the genotype U6 should be split into
different species, reducing the observed genetic diversity
within this species. Having more information on Single
Nucleotide Polymorphisms would help to delineate gene
flow and species boundaries in this ubiquitous species
complex. Isolates in the third morphological type do not
produce oospores in culture but can be identified based
on other morphological characteristics, molecular studies,
and the fact that they can be crossed with oospore producing strains of P. ultimum [3,12-14].
ESTs are a robust method for gene discovery and for identifying transcripts involved in specific biological processes. ESTs have been developed for over 40 oomycete and
fungal pathogens [15]. For the oomycetes, EST projects
have provided not only the first insight into the gene complement for these plant pathogens but also sets of genes
involved in a number of biological processes [16-24].
With the advent of reduced costs and higher throughput
sequencing methods, ESTs can be economically generated
for a wider range of organisms and a greater breadth of
conditions, thereby providing a more comprehensive
assessment of an organism's transcriptome. One emerging
platform for de novo sequencing of transcriptomes or
genomes is pyrosequencing [25]. However, the pyrosequencing-derived read lengths on the GS20 and FLX platform are substantially shorter than conventional Sangerbased sequencing which is problematic for assembly into

Results and Discussion
Sanger-based sequencing of a normalized cDNA library
A normalized cDNA library was generated from RNA isolated from hyphae growing on two contrasting media conditions, nutrient-rich and nutrient-starved conditions. A
total of 9,578 reads from Sanger-based sequencing was
generated; these assembled into 4,689 unique sequences
(assemblies plus singletons) with an average length of 596
nucleotides and a total length of 2.8 Mb (Table 1, Figure
1). The majority of assemblies contain two component
reads while very few assemblies contain six or more component reads (Figure 2). Overall, clustering and assembly
of the reads resulted in a two-fold reduction in the
number of unique sequences with few EST components
per assembly consistent with an effective normalization
treatment of the cDNA prior to library construction. We

a non-redundant set of consensus sequences. This limitation can be addressed through increased sequencing coverage of the transcriptome and/or through hybrid
approaches in which conventional Sanger sequences are
co-assembled
[26]
with
pyrosequencing-derived
sequences. Thus, for de novo sequencing of a transcriptome, both approaches are advantageous with pyrosequencing providing a deep representation of the
transcriptome and Sanger-derived sequences providing
seed sequences for assembly purposes. In this study, we
report the first set of ESTs for this agriculturally important
plant pathogen and provide a direct comparison of gene
discovery that can be obtained with two high throughput
sequencing methods, Sanger-based chain termination and
454 FLX pyrosequencing.

confirmed the origin of the ESTs by aligning the assemblies to a draft P. ultimum BR144 genome sequence [27].
For the Sanger-only assembly, 4,127 (88%) sequences
(1,408 assemblies, 2,719 singletons) aligned to the draft
genome. Of the 4,689 unique sequences, 2,345 (50.0%)
had sequence similarity with an entry in the UniRef100
database [28]. Within the set of 4,689 unique sequences
(assemblies and singletons), 4,444 open reading frames
(ORFs) could be predicted. Of these, 3,676 ORFs contained an ATG translational start codon while 2,413 had
both an ATG start codon and a stop codon. Of these 2,413
ORFs, 1,421 (58.6%) have sequence similarity with a protein sequence in the UniRef100 database that contains the
corresponding start codon and are thus potentially fulllength. The length of top UniRef100 matches ranged
between 50 to >500 amino acids in length, indicating that
the sequences and therefore the cDNAs generated from
this library were not biased towards either long or short
sequences.

A single half-plate pyrosequencing run on the same normalized cDNA used in the Sanger-based sequencing generated 139,839 reads, which after trimming and cleaning,
yielded 90,664 usable reads (>100 base pairs) with an
average length of 190 nucleotides and a total length of
17.3 Mb (Table 1). After clustering and assembly using the
TGICL clustering utilities [29], 66,312 sequence reads
were incorporated into 11,155 assemblies and 24,352 singletons for a total of 35,507 unique sequences. Assemblies
had an average length of 233 bp with a maximum length
of 1,385 bp (Table 1, Figure 1). For the 454 assembly,

25,285 (71%) sequences (9,226 assemblies, 16,059 singletons) aligned to the draft P. ultimum BR144 genome
sequence. Of these 35,507 unique sequences, 7,991
(22.5%) had a protein match with UniRef100 [28], significantly less than what was observed for the Sanger-derived
ESTs. If only sequences > 500 bp were considered, 71%
had a match with an entry in UniRef100 suggesting that
the short length of the 454 reads impact the ability to
detect similar sequences. As the pyrosequencing library
preparation involves random shearing of the normalized
(but uncloned) cDNA population [25], the pyrosequencing reads originate from random locations within each
cDNA and may have either orientation. The majority of
assemblies contain 2–5 reads, while in contrast only a few
of the assemblies contained over 100 pyrosequencing EST
reads (Figure 1). This is presumably due to both the length
of the individual reads, the normalization of the cDNA
population, and the coverage of the transcriptome represented in this dataset.
Hybrid assembly of Sanger and Pyrosequencing-based
reads
A hybrid assembly was constructed using the pyrosequencing- and Sanger-based EST reads which were clustered and assembled using the TGICL clustering utilities
[29]; of these, 10,811 were assemblies and 23,684 were
singletons for a total of 34,495 unique sequences (Table
1). Since the reads used in the hybrid assembly were predominantly derived from the pyrosequencing dataset,
with the exception of the maximum assembly length, the
assembly length and EST component statistics are similar
to that for the pyrosequencing-only reads (Figure 1). In
the hybrid assembly, a majority of assemblies are short
with an average length of 276 base pairs (maximum
length of 4,471 base pairs (Table 1)) and contain few
component reads (Figure 2). The majority of assemblies
contain 2–5 EST reads while only a limited number of
assemblies contain over 100 EST reads. For the hybrid
assembly, 24,140 (70%) sequences (8,922 assemblies,
15,218 singletons) aligned to the draft P. ultimum BR144
genome sequence. Within the hybrid assembly, 8,618 had
a protein match using UniRef100 [28] significantly less

than what was observed for the Sanger-derived ESTs yet
consistent with the abundance of 454 reads in the overall
hybrid assembly. If only sequences > 500 bp within the
hybrid assembly were considered, 69% had a match with
an entry in UniRef100. Pyrosequencing using the 454
platform is reported to have reduced accuracy in
homopolymer regions [25]. Examination of homopolymer regions (>4 nucleotides) detected between the
Sanger- and the 454-derived reads revealed differences in
homopolymer length between the Sanger and 454-reads
in 837 instances, primarily in A or T homopolymer
regions (407 A, 323 T, 65 G, 42 C).
A total of 1,110 unique sequences in the hybrid assembly
were derived from Sanger sequencing alone. Although the
majority of these had no similarity with entries in the
UniRef100 database (Additional Data Files 1 and 2), 907
(81.7%) of them mapped to the Pythium genome at very
high stringencies (95% identity, 95% coverage with a
minimum of 100 bp of the Sanger read; Cheung and
Buell, unpubl.), suggesting that these are not contaminants or artifacts within the cDNA library. Of the 1,110
unique sequences derived solely from Sanger reads, 576
had no match even at a very low threshold (BLASTN E-10
[30] or BLAT [31], default settings) with the pyrosequencing-derived sequences. Further analysis of these 576
Sanger-only reads showed that 461 (80%) could be
mapped to the Pythium genome with high stringency (≥
95% identity, ≥ 95% coverage, of a minimum of 100 bp
of the Sanger read). An analysis of average read length
revealed that these Sanger sequences were slightly shorter
on average (99 bp) than the complete set of Sanger
sequences which would reduce to the probability of coassembling with 454 reads during the hybrid assembly
process (average length of 497 nucleotides in Sanger-only
singletons and assemblies vs 596 nucleotides in the complete set of Sanger singletons and assemblies). Although
the GC content did not differ substantially between the
Sanger-only sequence set and the complete Sanger
sequence set (51% vs 53%), other sources of possible bias
could be the cloning and replication in E. coli which may
amplify select sequences in the library compared to the

454 sequences. These results suggest that a small proportion of ESTs generated by Sanger sequencing are not
present in the dataset generated by pyrosequencing.
Biological features of the P. ultimum transcriptome
The top 50 assemblies containing the most ESTs from all
three builds (pyrosequencing reads only, Sanger reads
only, hybrid assembly) ranged from 10 to 2,654 ESTs
(Additional Data Files 3, 4, 5). Most of the protein
matches to the top 50 assemblies from all three builds
were to Phytophthora species. In general, the most common annotations based on similarity to UniRef100
entries were housekeeping genes although 17 of the top
50 deepest assemblies from the hybrid assembly had no
match to an entry in UniRef100 (Additional Data File 3).

To determine how similar the P. ultimum transcriptome is
to other plant pathogenic oomycetes, we compared our
EST sequences with the predicted proteomes and transcriptomes available for four Phytophthora species: P.
infestans (transcriptome and predicted proteome), P. parasitica (transcriptome), P. ramorum (predicted proteome), and P. sojae (transcriptome and predicted
proteome) [32,33]. Using BLASTX with the predicted proteome data sets, 16,139 (46.8%) of the P. ultimum hybrid
assembly sequences matched a sequence present within
the P. infestans, P. ramorum, or P. sojae predicted proteomes. Using TBLASTX with a cutoff criterion of E = 1e10, 14,021 (40.6%) of the P. ultimum hybrid sequences
matched a sequence within the three Phytophthora transcriptomes with only 945 (2.7%) of the P. ultimum
sequences that align with a predicted Phytophthora protein not matching a Phytophthora transcript. Using
BLASTX with a cutoff criterion of E = 1e-5 against the
UniRef100 database, 8,618 (25.0%) of the P. ultimum
hybrid sequences matched the UniRef database, of which
673 (2.0%) did not also match a Phytophthora transcript
or predicted protein. Collectively, from all three datasets
(Phytophthora spp. predicted proteomes, Phytophthora
spp. transcriptomes, and the UniRef database), 16,738
(48.5%) of the P. ultimum hybrid sequences do not have
a match. This is most likely attributed to the short nature
of the majority of the hybrid sequences. Indeed, if only
sequences ≥ 500 bp within the hybrid assembly are considered (3,515 total sequences), the percentage of
sequences with an alignment to the three data types significantly increases; 3,201 (91.1%) align to the Phytophthora spp. predicted proteomes, 2,959 (84.2%) align to
the Phytophthora spp. transcriptomes, and 2,427 (69%)
align to the UniRef database, with only 252 (7.2%) without a match to any sequence within these data sets.
We also performed a comparative analysis of Gene Ontologies [34] with P. ultimum and the three Phytophthora proteomes. As shown in Figure 3, the normalized cDNA

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/542

obtained from hyphae grown in rich and nutrient-starved
conditions encoded a broad set of transcripts represented
within the molecular function gene ontologies. Furthermore, the representation is very similar to that of the complete proteomes of the three plant pathogenic
Phytophthora species suggesting that our approach of
cDNA normalization, coupled with deep sequencing, provided a near complete representation of the P. ultimum
transcriptome.
It recently emerged that Phytophthora and downy mildew
species secrete a vast repertoire of effector proteins that
modulate host defenses and enable pathogenicity [35,36].
The extent to which Pythium species also rely on secreted
effectors to colonize host tissue is unclear. We therefore
examined the P. ultimum ESTs for similarity to known
oomycete effectors. We first scanned the P. ultimum EST
hybrid assembly for candidate cytoplasmic effectors of the
RXLR and Crinkler (CRN) families [36,37] using a combination of the PexFinder algorithm [23] to identify putative secreted protein genes and sequence similarity
searches. An hmm profile based on an alignment of
known RXLR-EER effectors [38] revealed one P. ultimum
assembly (asmbl_7845) as a putative positive. P. ultimum
asmbl_7845 encodes an ORF with a signal peptide (SignalP HMM score = 0.921) followed by the RLLRSAGDVESSAVDDAAR sequence with similarity to the RXLRDEER motif (Additional Data File 6A–B). The identification of only a single putative RXLR effector is surprising
and contrasts to the common occurrence of RXLR effectors
in similar sets of Phytophthora ESTs [21]. Apparently, RXLR
effectors are not as widely present or expressed in P. ultimum as noted for Phytophthora species. There are several
possible explanations. It is possible that P. ultimum does
not have RXLR effector genes or has a highly reduced set
compared to Phytophthora. This would be consistent with
observations [39] that suggested that RXLR effectors are
delivered through haustoria, specialized infection structures that are not produced by Pythium. The RXLR motif is
similar in sequence, position and function to the Plasmodium Pexel/Host translocation motif [40]. The possible
absence of RXLR effectors in P. ultimum indicates that
although the motif is conserved across divergent parasitic
eukaryotes it may not be ubiquitous in oomycetes. Four
Crinkler-like sequences were identified among the P. ultimum hybrid assembly. In this case, the similarity to Phytophthora Crinklers was more convincing than for the
single RXLR effector candidate with BLASTX E values as
low as e-48. Clearly, these sequences displayed the consensus LXLYLAXR instead of the LXLFLAK motif that
defines canonical Phytophthora and downy mildew Crinklers [37,38] (Additional Data File 6C). In summary, we
detected one potential candidate RXLR and several Crinkler effectors in P. ultimum, however, they are not as abundantly represented among the examined P. ultimum ESTs

as they are in Phytophthora ESTs from similar developmental stages [21].
We also searched the P. ultimum assemblies for similarities
to other oomycete effectors. We detected three assemblies
with similarity to oomycete Kazal-like serine protease
inhibitors [41,42] and another three with similarity to
cystatin-like protease inhibitors [43] (Additional Data File
7). In Phytophthora, these apoplastic effectors are known to
inhibit defense related proteases of plants [41-43]. In
addition, at least 13 assemblies with similarity to elicitins
were identified (Additional Data File 7). Elicitins are
secreted lipid-binding oomycete proteins that trigger
defense responses in plants [36]. These elicitins showed
significant similarity to previously described Phytophthora
and Pythium elicitins with their characteristic cysteine-rich
domain [44,45]. Six assemblies were most similar to sylvaticin, a secreted elicitin of Pythium sylvaticum of

unknown function [45]. The same assemblies showed significant similarity with the elicitin-like protein of Pythium
oligandrum [46] but the homology was much lower than
that of P. sylvaticum (E value e-11). This is consistent with
the taxonomy and phylogeny of these species. Both P. ultimum (clade I) and P. sylvaticum (clade F) belong to the
globose sporangia group of Pythium whereas P. oligandrum
(clade D) belongs to a different group with contiguous
sporangia [47].
Unlike Phytophthora spp., Pythium and other oomycetes
like Saprolegnia spp. are not thiamine auxotrophs. Torto et
al. [48] reported sequences with similarity to thiamine
biosynthesis enzymes among ESTs of the fish pathogen
Saprolegnia parasitica that are missing in the genome
sequences of P. sojae, P. ramorum, P. infestans, and Hyaloperonospora parasitica. We identified four P. ultimum
sequences within the hybrid assembly (asmbl_312;

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:542

asmbl_353; asmbl_1697, and 334590_1440_2761) with
similarity to the S. parasitica thiamine biosynthesis
enzyme. This finding is consistent with the knowledge
that P. ultimum can synthesize thiamine. The thiamine
biosynthesis gene was apparently lost during the evolution of the Phytophthora/downy mildews lineage and
could serve as a potential phylogenetic marker among
Saprolegniales and the genus Pythium.
Oomycetes are often characterized by the ultrastructure of
their flagellar apparatus. Although the strain we
sequenced and P. ultimum var. ultimum are generally not
known to produce zoospores in vitro, it might be possible
that some flagellar associated proteins are expressed as
was observed in Phytophthora grown under conditions that
do not produce zoospores [21]. Some of the flagellar associated proteins from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (177 in
total, Additional Data File 8) that we identified in our
ESTs are predicted to be commonly expressed in other
structures/tissues than zoospores (e.g. calmodulin or
elongation factor). As shown by Randall et al[21], we also
found evidence of expression of dynein related to the flagellar apparatus (E values between e-6 and e-38) but we
also identified several flagellar basal body proteins (E values between e-8 and e-21) that were expressed.
Random candidate markers for population genetic studies
can also be derived from simple sequence repeats (SSRs).
Within the hybrid assembly, a total of 179 SSRs were identified within 164 sequences. Among the SSRs, monucleotides (45) were the most abundant followed by
dinucleotides (44), trinucleotides (33), pentanucleotides
(27), tetranucleotides (26), and hexanucleotides (4)
(Additional Data File 9). Lee and Moorman [49] developed SSR markers for Pythium aphanidermatum, P. cryptoirregulare and P. irregulare from an SSR enriched library.
Primers P18CCA1-41, P18TTC1-42, P18CAT1-74 amplified SSRs in P. ultimum but were not found in this EST
library. It is possible that the genes in which these SSRs
were located were not expressed, that these SSRs were in
non-coding regions, or that the primers designed from
other species worked on P. ultimum even if they had mismatches.

Conclusion
In this study, we report the integration of data from
Sanger-based chain termination and 454 FLX pyrosequencing technologies. The two technologies were highly
complementary although the shorter read length in the
pyrosequencing-derived ESTs is problematic in that they
limit biological interpretations due to the reduced information content in the predicted protein sequence. Thus,
while the pyrosequencing did provide depth of coverage,
we were able to generate a more robust set of transcribed

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/542

sequences for Pythium by co-assembly of Sanger and pyrosequencing derived ESTs. Furthermore, even with a greater
depth of ESTs provided through the 454 FLX platform, the
two sequencing methodologies generated sequences
unique to each platform. The results presented contain an
ample number of candidate polymorphic markers providing resources for potential phylogenetic and diagnostic
and strain marker development for this agriculturally
important group of plant pathogens. We expect that a similar analysis using other species and integration of data
from 454 FLX pyrosequencing technologies would work
synergistically with existing or new EST data and identify
new genes/transcripts at a very cost effective and efficient
manner.

Methods
Materials and Organismal Methods
Yeast extract broth (30 g/L sucrose, 1 g/L KH2PO4, 0.5 g/L
MgSO4 7H2O, 0.5 g/L KCl, 10 mg/L FeSO4 7H2O, 1 g/L
yeast extract) was inoculated with several crushed plugs of
3 day old P. ultimum strain DAOM BR144 (= ATCC
200006 = CBS 805.95) grown on 10% V8 agar and incubated at room temperature on a shaker (Lab-Line Instruments, Melrose Park, IL) at 200 rpm for 2 days. Plugs of
the same isolate were covered with modified Plich
medium (Kamoun, S., unpub.) in a Petri dish and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 10 days. Mycelia from both media were rinsed with 50 ml of sterile
water and harvested by straining through sterile cheesecloth, weighed and then ground in liquid nitrogen using
a mortar and pestle.
Molecular and Bioinformatics Methods
RNA was extracted from this tissue using TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Equal masses of total RNA from the
two growth conditions were used for construction of a
normalized cDNA population and subsequently, a normalized cDNA library. Using the services of Evrogen [50],
full length cDNA was constructed using the Smart cDNA
cloning methodology [51] and normalized using a
duplex-specific nuclease [50]. Two methods were used to
generate sequences from the normalized cDNA: Sangerbased dideoxy chain termination and Roche 454-FLX
pyrosequencing [25]. Sanger-based sequences were generated from end sequencing of cDNA clones using standard
high throughput sequencing methods on an ABI 3730xl
sequencer. Sequences were trimmed to remove vector,
low-quality, and E. coli sequences using Lucy [52] and iterative runs of the TIGR Seqclean Tool [53]. Accessions are
available in GenBank dbEST (EL774305–EL783216 and
ES607153–ES608087). Pyrosequencing was performed
on a Roche 454 FLX sequencer [25] using a half-plate.
Pyrosequencing reads were trimmed to remove adaptors

using TIGR Seqclean Tool [14]. Short sequences (< 100
nucleotides) were removed from the build process as the
addition of extremely short sequences will lead to false
joining of ESTs, chimeras that were sequenced, and
reduced quality of unique sequences. Sequences were
deposited in GenBank dbEST under accession numbers
FE969956–FF060620.
Pyrosequencing and Sanger cDNA reads were assembled
using the TGICL package [29] as was the hybrid assembly
using the default parameters as described in Childs et al.
[54] with the exception that sequences < 100 nucleotides
were excluded. Sequences were searched against the
UniRef100 database (Release 12.0) using BLASTX with a
cutoff criterion of E = 1e-5. The EST assemblies were
aligned with a draft assembly of the P. ultimum BR144
genome [27] using BLAT [31]. Pythium EST assemblies
were downloaded from The Comprehensive Phytopathogen Resource Trancript Assemblies website [15] and Phytophthora genome sequences were downloaded from
GenBank. Transcriptomes of P. ultimum version 1.0, P.
infestans version 3.0, P. sojae version 1.0, and P. parasitica
version 2.0 were aligned using TBLASTX with cutoff criteria of E = 1e-5. P. ultimum ESTs were aligned with the P.
ultimum [55], P. infestans [56], P. ramorum [33] and P. sojae
[33] genomes with TBLASTX requiring a minimium of
40% length matching. For the Gene ontology associations, the three Phytophthora proteomes were searched
against the current UniRef100 database using BLASTP and
a cutoff of 1e-5. GO ids were assigned using the EBI Uniprot Knowledgebase GOA file [57] using the top
UniRef100 hit. The assigned GO identifiers were then
mapped to the Generic GOSlim ontology using the
map2slim tool [58]. Using BLASTX and a cutoff of 1e-5,
the hybrid EST set was searched against 892
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii proteins flagged in GenBank as
being associated with the flagellar apparatus to identify
transcripts associated with the flagellar mechanism in
Pythium. Perfect mononucleotide to hexanucleotide simple sequence repeats were identified using MISA [59]. Perl
scripts were used to specify the minimum number of the
following repeats for microsatellites (unit size/minimum
number of repeats): (1/20) (2/10) (3/7) (4/5) (5/5) (6/5).
