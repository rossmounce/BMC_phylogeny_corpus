Abstract
Background: The eukaryotic TOR pathway controls translation, growth and the cell cycle in
response to environmental signals such as nutrients or growth-stimulating factors. The TOR
protein kinase can be inactivated by the antibiotic rapamycin following the formation of a ternary
complex between TOR, rapamycin and FKBP12 proteins. The TOR protein is also found in higher
plants despite the fact that they are rapamycin insensitive. Previous findings using the yeast two
hybrid system suggest that the FKBP12 plant homolog is unable to form a complex with rapamycin
and TOR, while the FRB domain of plant TOR is still able to bind to heterologous FKBP12 in the
presence of rapamycin. The resistance to rapamycin is therefore limiting the molecular dissection
of the TOR pathway in higher plants.
Results: Here we show that none of the FKBPs from the model plant Arabidopsis (AtFKBPs) is
able to form a ternary complex with the FRB domain of AtTOR in the presence of rapamycin in a
two hybrid system. An antibody has been raised against the AtTOR protein and binding of
recombinant yeast ScFKBP12 to native Arabidopsis TOR in the presence of rapamycin was
demonstrated in pull-down experiments. Transgenic lines expressing ScFKBP12 were produced
and were found to display a rapamycin-dependent reduction of the primary root growth and a
lowered accumulation of high molecular weight polysomes.
Conclusion: These results further strengthen the idea that plant resistance to rapamycin evolved
as a consequence of mutations in plant FKBP proteins. The production of rapamycin-sensitive
plants through the expression of the ScFKBP12 protein illustrates the conservation of the TOR
pathway in eukaryotes. Since AtTOR null mutants were found to be embryo lethal [1], transgenic
ScFKBP12 plants will provide an useful tool for the post-embryonic study of plant TOR functions.
This work also establish for the first time a link between TOR activity and translation in plant cells

Background
The TOR (Target Of Rapamycin) pathway is a conserved
eukaryotic pathway regulating growth, cell integrity and
survival as a function of many different inputs including
nutrient availability, energy status and mitogens in multicellular organisms [2-4]. TOR is a very large protein with
a Ser/Thr kinase domain preceded by several HEAT
repeats which interact with the numerous TOR protein
partners. Studies in yeast and animal cells have shown
that TOR acts positively on the activity of the eIF4F translation initiation complex and on the transcription of
ribosomal RNA and protein genes therefore promoting
growth in nutrient sufficient conditions [5-7]. In starvation conditions TOR regulates the utilization of alternative energy resources, allows autophagy and generally
drive the cell towards survival pathways [8-12]. Rapamycin, an antibiotic produced by the soil bacteria Streptomyces hygroscopicus was found to mimic starvation responses
in yeast through TOR inactivation and cell cycle arrest in
G1 [13]. Rapamycin leads to the formation of a ternary
complex by binding simultaneously to the FRB [FKP12
and Rapamycin Binding] domain of TOR and to the
ScFKBP12 protein [14]. ScFKBP12 is a peptidylprolyl isomerase that was originally identified as the cytosolic
receptor for the immunosuppressive drugs FK506 and
rapamycin [15]. This ternary complex is inactivating the
TOR kinase activity in a specific manner since no other
cellular targets of rapamycin are known [16]. In animal
cells, rapamycin has been shown to promote the dissociation of the TOR/Regulatory Associated Protein of TOR
[RAPTOR] complex [17]. RAPTOR, a member of one of
the two TOR [TORC1] complexes, is supposed to recruit
the various TOR substrates [18-20].
Arabidopsis possesses a single TOR encoding gene and its
inactivation was found to arrest embryo developement at
an early stage [1]. Further studies demonstrated that
AtTOR expression is limited to regions where cell proliferation occurs such as apical and root meristematic zones.
Two homologs of Raptor have been found in Arabidopsis
[21,22]. Some targets of TOR, such as eIF4E and S6 ribosomal kinase (S6K) are also conserved in plants [23,24]
and plant TOR was found to phosphorylate S6K [25].
Rapamycin susceptibility is widespread among eukaryotes
since the growth of most fungi and animal cells is affected
by rapamycin. Although lands plants where found to be
resistant to rapamycin action, green algae, such as
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii are susceptible to rapamycin
[11].
Examination of the amino acid sequence of Arabidopsis
FKBP12 protein shows that several amino acids known to
be important for rapamycin binding in yeast an animal
FKBP12s are replaced which suggests that susceptibility to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/26

rapamycin has been lost during land plant evolution due
to the inability of plant FKBP12 to bind rapamycin and to
promote the formation of the TOR inactivation complex
[11]. To support this hypothesis, expression of Vicia faba
FKBP12 did not restore the sensitivity of a yeast ScFKBP12
mutant to rapamycin [26]. This result was further strenghtened by the observation that, in two-hybrid interaction
experiments in yeast, the conserved FRB domain of AtTOR
was able to bind to ScFKBP12 in a rapamycin dependent
manner while it did not binds to AtFKBP12 [1]. Furthermore, interaction between the AtTOR FRB domain and
human FKBP12 was also described [25]. The experiments
described above therefore led us to the hypothesis that
rapamycin susceptibility in plants could be restored by the
expression of an heterologous FKBP protein. This would
allow the use of rapamycin in plants to decipher the outputs of the TOR signaling pathway and to analyze the consequences of a post-embryonic inactivation of AtTOR. In
this work we show that native AtTOR binds in vitro to
recombinant ScFKBP12 in the presence of rapamycin and
that expression of ScFKBP12 in transgenic plants results in
a partial and rapamycin-dependent arrest of root growth.

Results
AtFKBP proteins cannot interact with rapamycin and TOR
The Arabidopsis genome contains 17 predicted FKBP-like
proteins [27]. Comparison of Arabidopsis FKBP
sequences shows that the closest relatives of ScFKBP12 are
AtFKBP12, AtFKBP15-1, AtFKBP15-2 and the first FRB
(FK506 and Rapamycin Binding) domain of AtFKBP62
(Fig. 1A). Some amino acids known to be involved in the
formation of the rapamycin inhibitory complex [14] are
absent from AtFKBP12 but are present in the other Arabidopsis FKBPs. This is the case of Tyr26 (numbered according to human HsFKBP12), Asp 38 and Gln 54 which are
absent from AtFKBP12 but exists in AtFKBP15-1,
AtFKBP15-2 and AtFKBP62. However, in these AtFKBPs a
proline is replacing Gly89 which is known to be required
for the complex formation (Figure 1A). This suggests that
none of the plant FKBPs is able to engage into a TOR
inhibiting complex with rapamycin. Menand et al [1]
showed that, in a two-hybrid system, the FRB domain of
AtTOR can bind to ScFKBP12. The same system was used
to show that AtFKBP12, AtFKBP15-1, AtFKBP15-2 and
AtFKBP62 are all unable to form a complex with the
AtTOR FRB domain and rapamycin (Figure 1B).
AtTOR can bind ScFKBP12 in the presence of rapamycin
in vivo and in vitro
In vitro binding between ScFKBP12 and the native AtTOR
protein was further investigated. To this end, recombinant
ScFKBP12 was produced in E.coli as a fusion with a polyhistidine track and its binding to AtTOR was examined by
pull-down experiments in the presence of rapamycin.
Given the extremely large size of AtTOR, recombinant

protein production would be difficult to perform. Hence
the source of AtTOR was a proliferating Arabidopsis cell
culture in which we previously observed a high level of
expression of an AtTOR-GUS translational fusion [1]. An
antibody directed against amino-acid 2341 to 2449 of
AtTOR was raised in rabbits and used to detect the presence AtTOR in pull-down experiments.
Nickel-agarose bound ScFKBP12 was mixed with soluble
Arabidopsis cell proteins with or without 10 µg/ml
rapamycin and the resin washed before elution of
ScFKBP12. Ni+ bound proteins were submitted to western
blot analysis and His-ScFKBP12 and AtTOR were visualized using anti-His antibody and anti-AtTOR antibody,
respectively. Figure 1C show that AtTOR can be detected
at its predicted molecular mass (240 kDa) in a soluble
protein extract from Arabidopsis cells (lane 2). When Ni+agarose bound His-ScFKBP12 was mixed with Arabidopsis proteins in the presence of rapamycin, AtTOR can be
detected together with His-ScFKBP12 in the resin eluate
(lane 3), while in the absence of rapamycin only HisScFKBP12 can be detected (lane 4). This shows that native
AtTOR was retained to the column through a rapamycinScFKBP12 bridge and that binding of AtTOR to the
ScFKBP12-resin did not occur in the absence of rapamycin.

Expression of ScFKBP12 in Arabidopsis
The above results show that ScFKBP12, rapamycin and
AtTOR form a ternary complex in vitro and suggests that
ScFKBP12 has the potential to inactivate AtTOR in vivo in
the presence of rapamycin. This prompted us to test this
idea by an experiment where ScFKBP12 would be
expressed inside a plant cell. To this end, the coding
region of ScFKBP12 was placed under the control of the
constitutive CaMV 35S promoter and introduced into Arabidopsis (ecotype Columbia) through Agrobacteriummediated transformation. About 20 independent primary
transgenic plants were generated and lines homozygous
for the transgene were selected using hygromycin resistance segregation. No obvious morphological phenotypes
appeared in any of the selected lines. Insertion of the
ScFKBP12 transgene was verified by PCR analysis. Northern blot analysis allowed to select five lines expressing the
ScFKBP12 mRNA at different levels (Figure 2).
ScFKBP12 expressing lines are susceptible to rapamycin
Expression analysis of the AtTOR gene fused to the GUS
reporter gene showed that AtTOR is mainly expressed in
meristems and particularly in the meristem of the primary
root (Fig. 3A) [1]. The growth and architecture of the plant
root system is very plastic and responds to changes in the
availability of nutriments in the surrounding media.
Therefore, for each transgenic line, sterile seeds were sown
on vertical plates on synthetic media with or without

rapamycin (10 µg/ml) using Col0 seeds as a control, and
the growth of the primary roots was monitored. At ten
days after germination, all transgenic lines displayed a significant growth retardation in the presence of rapamycin,
while rapamycin had no effect on the primary root growth
of the control plants (Fig. 3B). The line 25c show the highest reduction in primary root growth and a comparative
increase in the length of secondary roots (Fig. 3C). This
line was therefore selected for further analysis. This line
does not display the highest expression of ScFKBP12
mRNA in leaves. The lack of a strict correlation between
expression levels in leaves and rapamycin sensitivity is
likely to be caused by variable transgene expression in the
meristem, where AtTOR is present, depending on its
genomic environment. In another experiment, 25 mg of
Col0 control and 25c line seeds were allowed to germinate in liquid medium with or without rapamycin and
fresh weight was recorded after 10 days. This shows again
that overall growth of line 25c was reduced only in the
presence of rapamycin. As one of the primary target of the
TOR pathway is the protein synthesis machinery, plantlets
from this experiment were further used to study the accumulation of polysomes. Although the polysome profiles
of Col0 control plantlets grown with and without rapamycin were almost completely superposable, the profile of
the 25c line displayed a lower accumulation of high
molecular weight polysomes in the presence of rapamycin
(Fig. 4). This strongly suggests that slower growth of the
25c line in the presence of rapamycin is a consequence of
a reduced protein synthesis activity.

rapamycin. This feature is likely to be due to mutations
arising in the plant homologs of FKBP12 rather than in
plant TOR proteins themselves. This work indeed shows
that the native Arabidopsis TOR protein extracted from
cultured cells can bind to the rapamycin-ScFKBP12 complex in vitro. These results support the in vitro interaction
observed between a recombinant AtTOR FRB domain,
rapamycin and human FKBP12 (HsFKBP) [25]. The
rapamycin binding domain of TOR (FRB domain) is
therefore functionally conserved among all eukaryotes,
independently of the presence of FKBP proteins allowing
ternary complex formation and inactivation of TOR. The
function of this domain is still unknown but its wide phylogenetic structural conservation suggests that its role is
independent of the binding of FKBP proteins. One likely
hypothesis is that it binds a small molecule or protein that
is structurally similar to rapamycin.

Given the diverse range of enzymatic activities that plants
can display and the fact that rapamycin producing Streptomyces are soil borne bacteria, plant resistance to rapamycin might be the consequence of a detoxifying activity. The
results presented here show that this is unlikely to happen
since ternary complex formation in the presence of
rapamycin can occur within a crude Arabidopsis protein
extract. Moreover in vivo expression of ScFKBP12 can
restore the activity of rapamycin in the transformed
plants. This suggests that rapamycin is not efficiently
detoxified in plant cells.
In vivo sternary complex formation
Growth reduction in transformed plants expressing the
ScFKBP12 protein occurred only in the presence of
rapamycin. Since we have also shown that the AtTORrapamycin-ScFKBP12 complex can be formed in vitro but
is dependent upon the addition of rapamycin, this
strongly suggests that the observed decrease in growth is
the consequence of an inactivation of AtTOR by rapamycin and ScFKBP12. However, we have previously shown
that the knock-out inactivation of AtTOR by T-DNA insertion results in a complete halt of embryonic growth at an
early stage [1] and it is known that rapamycin addition
completely arrest growth in yeast and animal cells [4].
Therefore AtTOR inactivation by rapamycin in ScFKBP12
transgenic lines may be only partial. On one hand this
could be due to inefficient translation, folding or stability
of the ScFKBP12 protein or to limited diffusion of
rapamycin in plant cells. On the other hand it is conceivable that AtTOR is mainly required during a short time
window during embryogenesis and that further growth of
the adult plant is only partially dependent of the TOR
pathway, its inactivation leading thus to partial growth
inhibition. The TOR pathway is known to control growth
through ribosome biogenesis and translation [3,8] and
rapamycin inactivation of TOR in yeast results in a drasti-

cally reduced accumulation of high molecular weight
polysomes [28]. We show here that ScFKBP expressing
plantlets displayed a reduced amount of high molecular
weight polysomes, which correspond to actively translated mRNA, in the presence of rapamycin. Although the
presence of the TOR protein seemed restricted to proliferative zones [1], inactivation of translation by rapamycin
in the ScFKBP12 expressing lines was detected in the
whole plant. It could thus be that AtTOR is present in all
tissues but at a higher level in proliferative tissues where
the demand for an active translation is higher. These
results show that AtTOR is modulating translation in
plants and that this control, and ultimately that of the
growth process itself, is conserved through eukaryotes.

Conclusion
This work shows that rapamycin susceptibility can be
restored in plants by expression of an heterologous FKBP
and that land plant rapamycin resistance is likely to occurs
through evolution of the plant FKBP. The transgenic lines
described in this work therefore represent the first available tools to inhibit TOR activity post-embryonically in
Arabidopsis and will allow to further study the functions
of the TOR signaling pathway in plants.

Methods
Arabidopsis Lines
The Arabidopsis thaliana cell suspension culture [29] was
grown in sterile culture medium containing Murashige
and Skoog salts (Sigma), 0.5 mM kinetin, 0.34 mM 2-4D,
vitamins mix, (4 mM Nicotinic Acid, 1.26 µM Calcium
Dpantothenate, 2.66 mM Glycine, 150 µM ThiamineHCl, 110 µM Folic acid, 0.25 mM Pyridoxine-HCl, 20 µM
Biotine and 28 mM Myo-inositol) and 3 % sucrose with
pH 5.6. Cells in 100 mL of medium were incubated in a
250 mL conical flask and shaken at 125 rpm at 25°C in an
orbital shaker under constant illumination (Infors, Massy,
France). Every 9 d, subculturing was carried out by pipetting approximately 10 mL of the suspension (5% Packed
Cell Volume) into 90 mL of fresh medium.

The Arabidopsis tor+/- mutants have been described previously [1]. Gus staining was performed as described with a
4 h incubation at 37°C [30]. Observations were performed with a Leica MZ FL3 binocular.
ScFKBP12 full ORF was amplified from pSBH1 [31] with
primers
5'-CGGATATCATGTCTGAAGTAATTGAAGGTAAC-3' and 5'-GGACTGCAGCATGATGAGCTCTGCATCCGCCA-3'. The PCR product was digested with EcoRV and
NotI and cloned under control of the CAMV35S promoter
in pRT103 digested with XhoI, klenow treated and subsequently digested with NotI. The expression cassette was
then moved into the unique AscI site of the pGPTVHygro
binary vector [32]. This construction was introduced by

electroporation in Agrobacterium tumefaciens cells and
transformation of Arabidopsis plants was carried out by
the floral dip method [33]. The transformed plants were
selected on solid medium with 30 µg of Hygromycin B
and tested by PCR with the primer described above for the
insertion of ScFKBP12. Control PCR of the AtTOR FRB
domain was performed using primers: 5'-GCCATATGAGGGTTGCCATACTTTGGCATG-3' and 5'-GCAGATCCTTAGCTAGCTGTTTGTAATCCG-3'.
Two-hybrid experiments
Two-hybrid experiments were performed according to [1]
using Saccharomyces cerevisae strain SMY87-4 (MATa trp1901 leu2-3, 112 ura3-52 his3-200 ade2 gal4 gal80∆

a derivative of the two-hybrid host strain PJ69-4A in
which the FKBP12 encoding gene is disrupted [34] and
contain plasmid pTR17 (URA3) expressing a dominant
rapamycin resistant allele of the TOR2 gene [35]. To generate GAL4(BD)::AtFKBP fusions Arabidopsis FKBPs were
amplified from a cDNA library [36], using primers 5'GGACTGCAGCATGATGAGCTCTGCATCCGCCATGAA3' end 5'-GCAGCGGCCGCTCAAAGCTCATTCTTTGATTTCGC-3'

and
5'GCAGCGGCCGCTCAACATATATCCTTCACACTGTCC-3'
for AtFKBP62. PCR products were digested with PstI and
NotI and cloned in pBI880 digested using the same
enzymes. For ScFKBP12, the full ORF has been excised
from pSBH1 [31] using BamHI. The fragment has been
Klenow treated and cloned in pBI880 treated with the
SmaI enzyme. For the AtFKBP12 construction (gift from
JD Faure), the full ORF has been cloned between SalI and
NotI sites of pBI880.

After selection for the presence of the three plasmids, cotransformed yeast strains were grown overnight resuspended in top agar (0,7% in water) and spread on solid
medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, uracil and adenine.
1 µg of rapamycin were deposed on Whatman paper discs,
on the surface of the agar, and cells were incubated at
30°C for 5 days. Accession numbers; ATFKBP62: GenBank NM113429; AtFKBP15-2: Genbank NM124234;

purified PCR product was digested with BamHI and HindIII and cloned in the pET28a (+) vector (Novagen)
digested by the same enzymes. E.coli strain rosetta (Stratagene) was used for protein expression. After IPTG induction, bacterially expressed proteins were loaded onto 1 ml
of Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen), and incubated for 30 minutes on ice. For pull down experiment, total soluble proteins from Arabidopsis suspension cells were prepared by
grinding 1 g of cells in 10 ml of freshly prepared extraction
buffer, (25 mM TrisHCl pH7.5, 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM
MgCl2, 5 mM EDTA, 10 mM -mercaptoethanol, 1 mM
PMSF, 0.2 mg/ml benzidine and 0.2 mg/ml leupeptin).
The homogenate was centrifuged (15000g) for 15 min to
remove insoluble material. Rapamycin was added to 1 ug/
ml and 4 ml of this extract was loaded to the column containing recombinant ScFKBP12 followed by 2 h incubation on ice. The column was washed with 1 ml of Buffer A
(50 mM Tris pH 7.4, Na2SO4 50 mM, glycerol 15%) and
1.5 ml of buffer A containing 30 mM imidazole. Proteins
were eluted with 1,5 ml of 300 mM imidazole buffer and
concentrated on Microcon YM50 (Millipore). For production of recombinant ScFKBP12, after loading of the bacterial extract, the column was washed in 4 ml buffer A and
the proteins eluted as above.

removed by centrifugation at 7 000 rpm for 15 min at
4°C. Supernatants were loaded on 11 mL 0.8–1.5 M
sucrose gradient made in 40 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.4, 20 mM
KCl and 10 mM MgCl2. After centrifugation at 32 000 × g
in a Beckman SW41 rotor for 150 min, gradients were

solution with 0.8% agar supplemented with 10 µg/ml of
Rapamycin in DMSO. After 48 h at 4°C, plates were
placed vertically under 16 h/8 h light/dark period at
23°C/18°C respectively. Root growth was monitored
each day and measurements were processed with the NIH
Image software.

Authors' contributions
Western blotting and antibody production
Eluted samples were loaded on 4–12% SDS-PAGE gradient gels under reducing conditions. The resolved proteins
were blotted onto Immobilon-P (Millipore, Bedford,
MA), blocked in 5% skim milk, and probed with each primary antibody, followed by incubation with the alkaline
phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody. NBT/BCIP
Western blotting detection reagents (Biorad) were used
for detection. For production of the AtTOR antibody, a
DNA fragment corresponding to amino-acids 2341 to
2449 of AtTOR was cloned into pET41 (Novagen) as a
fusion with Glutathion-S-Transferase. Recombinant protein was produced in E. coli BL21 (DE3) and was used to
generate antibodies in rabbits (Eurogentech). Anti-His
antibody was from Amersham Biosciences.

RS performed the analysis of transgenic plants, polysome
analysis and prepared the figures, YL prepared recombinant protein and raised the antibody, BM performed
genetic constructions, two-hybrid experiments and initiate plant transformation, CL and NJ helps with pull-down
experiments, BM, CM and CR conceived the experiments,
CM and CR wrote the manuscript.

Northern blotting and polysome analysis
Total RNA was isolated with an RNeasy Plant Mini Kit
(Qiagen, Tokyo, Japan) and displayed on Agarose gel containing formaldehyde (1.5%). RNA was transferred on
Hybond-N+ (Amersham Biosciences) and cross-linked to
the membrane. ScFKBP12 probe was amplified by PCR
with pSBH1 using PCR DIG probe synthesis kit (Roche)
Protocols and reagents for the chemiluminescent detection were according to the DIG luminescent detection Kit
(Roche).

For polysome analysis, after stratification, 25 mg of seeds
were grown for 10 days in 20 ml of liquid MS/2 medium
containing 1% sugar at 25°C under constant illumina-
