Abstract
Background: The transcription factors of the LSF/Grainyhead (GRH) family are characterized by the possession of a
distinctive DNA-binding domain that bears no clear relationship to other known DNA-binding domains, with the
possible exception of the p53 core domain. In triploblastic animals, the LSF and GRH subfamilies have diverged
extensively with respect to their biological roles, general expression patterns, and mechanism of DNA binding. For
example, Grainyhead (GRH) homologs are expressed primarily in the epidermis, and they appear to play an ancient role
in maintaining the epidermal barrier. By contrast, LSF homologs are more widely expressed, and they regulate general
cellular functions such as cell cycle progression and survival in addition to cell-lineage specific gene expression.
Results: To illuminate the early evolution of this family and reconstruct the functional divergence of LSF and GRH, we
compared homologs from 18 phylogenetically diverse taxa, including four basal animals (Nematostella vectensis,
Vallicula multiformis, Trichoplax adhaerens, and Amphimedon queenslandica), a choanoflagellate (Monosiga brevicollis)
and several fungi. Phylogenetic and bioinformatic analyses of these sequences indicate that (1) the LSF/GRH gene
family originated prior to the animal-fungal divergence, and (2) the functional diversification of the LSF and GRH
subfamilies occurred prior to the divergence between sponges and eumetazoans. Aspects of the domain architecture
of LSF/GRH proteins are well conserved between fungi, choanoflagellates, and metazoans, though within the Metazoa,
the LSF and GRH families are clearly distinct. We failed to identify a convincing LSF/GRH homolog in the sequenced
genomes of the algae Volvox carteri and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii or the amoebozoan Dictyostelium purpureum.
Interestingly, the ancestral GRH locus has become split into two separate loci in the sea anemone Nematostella, with
one locus encoding a DNA binding domain and the other locus encoding the dimerization domain.
Conclusions: In metazoans, LSF and GRH proteins play a number of roles that are essential to achieving and
maintaining multicellularity. It is now clear that this protein family already existed in the unicellular ancestor of animals,
choanoflagellates, and fungi. However, the diversification of distinct LSF and GRH subfamilies appears to be a
metazoan invention. Given the conserved role of GRH in maintaining epithelial integrity in vertebrates, insects, and
nematodes, it is noteworthy that the evolutionary origin of Grh appears roughly coincident with the evolutionary
origin of the epithelium.
Background
In triploblastic animals, LSF/Grainyhead (GRH) transcription factors perform a number of functions essential
to both development and homeostasis. They are involved
in regulation of the cell cycle, cell division, and cellular

differentiation in a range of developmental and nondevelopmental contexts [1-14].
The LSF/Grainyhead family is split into the LSF/CP2
subfamily and the Grainyhead (GRH) subfamily, which
can be distinguished by their distinctive oligomerization
domains and differences in their oligomerization behavior [10,15,16]. GRH binds to DNA as a dimer, whereas
LSF binds as a tetramer [17,18]. The DNA binding
regions in both protein subfamilies show a large amount
of conservation [17,18], but each has distinct transcrip-

tional targets. GRH binds to the DNA sequence: (A/
T)C(A/C/T)(G/T)GTT(C/G/T), whereas LSF binds to a
direct repeat with the consensus sequence of N(C/G/
T)N(C/G/T)(C/G)N(C/T)N(C/G/T)NN(C/G/T)(C/G/
T)N(A/C/G)N [15,16,18,19]. LSF proteins can also be distinguished from GRH by the possession of a sterile alpha
motif (SAM) [20]. Members of both LSF and GRH subfamilies were previously identified in vertebrates, arthropods, and nematodes, so the origin of the family and the
diversification into subfamilies is known to predate the
evolutionary split between protostomes and deuterostomes [15]. Recently, a common origin for the LSF/GRH
family and the p53 family has been proposed based on
similarities in the folding of their DNA-binding domains
[20].
The differences in the molecular functions of LSF and
GRH are accompanied by important differences in their
biological roles. In both vertebrates and protostome
invertebrates, GRH proteins are involved in the development and maintenance of epithelial integrity [21]. For
example, in mice, grh is required during embryogenesis
where it is expressed exclusively in the developing ectodermal epithelium [22]. Furthermore, embryonic mice
lacking grhl-3 exhibit insufficient wound repair and
abnormal skin barrier formation leading to excessive
postnatal water loss. The water loss is associated with
reduced expression of the gene encoding TGase1, an
enzyme that promotes cross-linking of parts of the stratum corneum, thus preventing the movement of water
and solutes [22]. Likewise, in Xenopus, a Grh-like gene
(Xgrh1) has been implicated in the development of the
epidermis [13]. One of its primary targets is epidermal
keratin. In morpholino studies, knockdown of Xgrhl led
to loss of surface structures and pigmentation as well as
neck and eye defects associated with epidermal instability
[13]. In Drosophila, GRH plays a critical role in epithelial
integrity that is analogous to and perhaps homologous
with the role played in vertebrates--GRH maintains the
tension of the Drosophila cuticle, and it induces cuticle
development and cuticle repair following injury [23,24].
Similarly, the CeGrh1 protein of C. elegans appears to be
required for proper cuticle formation during development, as its knockdown leads to soft, malformed cuticles
and embryonic lethality [15].
In addition to its widely conserved role in maintaining
epidermal integrity, Grh is also involved in the specification and development of the CNS in both Drosophila and
mice [9,25]. Additionally, in mice, Grh mutants exhibit
defects of the salivary and kidney ducts and eyelid closure
[26-28], and in humans, a single nucleotide polymorphism found in GRHL2 is associated with age-related
hearing impairment [29].
The biological roles of LSF are diverse and they have
clearly diverged from those of GRH, at least in mammals,

where the function of LSF has been well characterized.
LSF is ubiquitously expressed [30]. It appears to play a
role in liver function, eye development, erythropoesis,
neural and immune function, regulation of the cell cycle
progression, and cell survival [8,16,31-42].
When the ancestors of the LSF and GRH subfamilies
first originated via a gene duplication event from their
common ancestor, they would presumably have had identical or largely overlapping functions. However, at least in
extant mammals, LSF and GRH have diverged extensively
with respect to their biological roles. The basis for this
functional diversification is not clear. The common
ancestral functional repertoire of LSF and GRH may have
become "subfunctionalized" in the two descendants [43].
Alternatively or in concert, LSF and GRH may have independently acquired novel functions since their split from
a common ancestral gene ("neofunctionalization")
[43,44].
If we wish to reconstruct the initial functional diversification of LSF and GRH, it is necessary to identify the
ancestor in which the original gene duplication occurred.
This may permit us to infer the functional repertoire of
the LSF/GRH ancestor, and to compare this ancestral
condition with the function of LSF and GRH in a phylogenetic progression of extant taxa. By comparing vertebrates, arthropods, and nematodes, Venkatesan and coworkers previously showed that the origin of distinct LSF
and GRH subfamilies predated the diversification of
triploblasts into distinct protostome and deuterostome
lineages [15]. With the recent availability of sequenced
genomes from several basal metazoans, a choanoflagellate, and more distantly related fungal outgroups, we can
track the evolution of the LSF/GRH family into the much
more distant past. In this study, we report the identification of LSF/GRH family members in 24 previously unreported species. Through a combination of genome
prospecting and phylogenetic analysis, we show that the
original gene duplication that produced the LSF and
GRH subfamilies occurred prior to the evolutionary radiation of basal animal lineages (e.g., Bilateria, Cnidaria,
Ctenophora, Porifera, and Placozoa). Interestingly, the
GRH protein of the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis,
a representative cnidarian, appears to have split into two
distinct loci. We also identify six protein motifs that are
widely shared between the LSF and GRH subfamilies of
metazoans, all of which can be traced to the common
ancestor of metazoans and fungi. In addition, there is a
single motif that appears unique to the LSF subfamily.

including three chordates (Branchiostoma floridae, Ciona
intestinalis, Fugu rubripes), three arthropods (Anopheles
gambiae, Daphnia pulex, and Drosophila melanogaster),
an annelid (Capitella spp.), a mollusc (Lottia gigantea), a
cnidarian (Nematostella vectensis), and a sponge
(Amphimedon queenslandica). We also identified a
strong match to human GRHL2 in the ctenophore (Vallicula multiformis) and the placozoan (Trichoplax adhaerens). We were not able to identify putative LSF orthologs
in either the ctenophore or the placozoan.
The cnidarian Nematostella is unusual in that its GRH
homolog appears to be split between two loci. NevGRH1, which had been reported previously [45],
emerged as a strong match to the entire human GRHL2

protein. However, as Nev-GRH1 appears to be truncated
relative to the human protein, we conducted a separate
BLAST search using only the carboxy terminal region of
the human protein as a query sequence. Nev-GRH2,
which was identified in this second BLAST search, is a
strong match to the carboxy terminal portion of the
human GRHL2 protein.
Among choanoflagellates and fungi, we were also able
to identify members of the LSF/GRH family, but clear
evidence for distinct LSF and GRH family members was
less compelling. The sequenced genome of the choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis appears to encode only a single LSF/GRH related gene. Likewise, we could identify
only a single LSF/GRH homolog in the genomes of four

Traylor-Knowles et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:101
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/101

fungi (Mycosphaerella fijiensis, Mycosphaerella graminicola, Phanerochaete chrysosporium and Trichoderma
virens). We did identify two LSF/GRH-related sequences
in Aspergillus niger (phylum Ascomycota) and Phycomyces brevicollis (phylum Zygomycota), but in both cases,
the two sequences appeared most similar to each other,
suggesting that they might have resulted from lineagespecific
gene
duplications.
In members of the kingdom Plantae, evidence of LSF/
GRH family members was far more tenuous. Using a less
stringent E-value cut off (e-1), we identified two proteins
with limited resemblance to LSF/GRH in Selaginella
moellendorffii, a lycophyte. In addition, we also identified
a protein with similarity to LSF in the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Using this Chlamydomonas
sequence to query the genome of Volvox carteri, we identified the corresponding gene in this alga.
Protein motif identification

MEME analysis (Additional file 1) reveals extensive conservation in motif architecture within and between the
LSF and GRH proteins of animals; it also reveals extensive conservation between these animal proteins and the
LSF/GRH-related proteins of the choanoflagellate and
the fungi (Figure 1). Overall, the MEME analysis identified 19 motifs that exhibit significant conservation
between two or more sequences (Figure 2). Six motifs (4,
5, 6, 9, 10 and 11) are almost universally conserved
among animal, choanoflagellate, and fungal sequences.
Several of these motifs either correspond to previously
identified functional domains, or they reside within such
domains. Motif 1 corresponds to the activation domain
[3,16,46]. Motifs 4, 5, 6, 9, 10 and 11 reside within the
DNA binding domain [18,20,47]. Motif 15 corresponds to
the SAM domain, and motifs 18 and 19 correspond to the
dimerization domain. Two adjacent motifs (13 and 15)
are well conserved among LSF proteins. While motif 15
was also identified in the choanoflagellate protein, the cooccurrence of motifs 13 and 15 appears characteristic of
the LSF subfamily, with the exception of the sponge LSF
sequence that did not exhibit a significant match to motif
13.
The motif analysis reveals strong similarities between
the pairs of sequences identified in each of the two fungal
species. The two proteins from the ascomycote fungus,
Aspergillus, are nearly identical to each with respect to
motif architecture, and they can be distinguished from
other sequences by the possession of motifs 14, 16, and
17. Likewise, the two sequences from the zygomycote
fungus, Phycomyces, are most similar to each other with
respect to the arrangement of conserved motifs.
The motif analysis also supports the conclusion that the
GRH locus of the cnidarian Nematostella has experienced a split. Nev-GRH1 encompasses six conserved
motifs (4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11), and these motifs occupy the

Page 6 of 13

same relative positions as in the GRH proteins of fruit fly
and sponge. Nev-GRH2 encompasses conserved motifs
18 and 19, which occupy the same relative position in
most other metazoan GRH sequences.
Phylogenetic analysis

All phylogenetic analyses that we performed can be
rooted so that the fungal sequences and the metazoan
sequences form mutually exclusive monophyletic groups
(Figure 3; Additional file 2). On the neighbor-joining tree
(Figure 3), the metazoan clade can be further subdivided
into putative LSF and GRH clades. Within the LSF clade,
the triploblastic animals form a monophyletic group to
the exclusion of two diploblastic animals (Nematostella
and Amphimedon). Similarly, within the GRH clade, the
triploblastic animals form a monophyletic group to the
exclusion of four diploblastic animals (Nematostella,
Amphimedon, Trichoplax, and Vallicula), implying that
both LSF and GRH subfamilies had originated prior to
the evolutionary split between diploblasts and triploblasts. The single Trichoplax sequence groups within the
GRH clade. Though the bootstrap support for this grouping is low, along with the motif analysis, this suggests that
the Trichoplax sequence may be a true GRH ortholog
(implying that the LSF ortholog of Trichoplax has either
been lost or we failed to find it). The single Monosiga
sequence appears at the base of the LSF clade, suggesting
that it might be a true LSF ortholog (which would imply
that LSF and GRH diverged before the split between animals and choanoflagellates). The single Vallicula
sequence groups with GRH sequences of other diploblastic animals.
The maximum-likelihood analysis (Additional file 2)
supports most of the major divisions that appear on the
neighbor-joining tree. The animal sequences and fungal
sequences comprise discrete subtrees. The LSF
sequences form a putative clade, and within this clade,
the LSF sequences of triploblasts cluster together to the
exclusion of LSF sequences from diploblasts. Likewise,
the GRH sequences of triploblasts also group together.
However, the putative GRH sequences of diploblastic animals do not form a monophyletic group with the GRH
sequences of triploblasts as they do on the neighbor-joining tree. Instead, the sponge and ctenophore sequences
appear more closely related to the LSF clade, while the
precise position of the anemone and placozoan GRH
sequences is not resolved.
On both the neighbor-joining tree and the maximumlikelihood tree, bootstrap support for individual nodes is
generally low because the analyses are based on a small
number of highly conserved residues. However, both
phylogenies are consistent with divisions between animal
and fungal sequences and between LSF and GRH
sequences, the same divisions that are implied by the
motif analysis.

Nev-GRH1 and Nev-GRH2

The sea anemone, Nematostella vectensis, is unique in
that the GRH locus has been split in two, with Nev-Grh1
encoding primarily the DNA-binding domain and NevGrh2 encoding primarily the dimerization domain. In the
current draft assembly of the genome, Nev-Grh1 maps to
scaffold 2, and Nev-Grh1 maps to scaffold 38 (Joint
Genome Institute, Nematostella vectensis v1.0; Figure 4).
Nev-Grh1 is flanked by a QRSL1 like gene and a B9D1like gene. Nev-Grh2 is flanked by an arylsulfatase-like
gene and an opsin-like gene. Even if these two scaffolds
reside on the same chromosome, based on the location of
each gene within its respective scaffold, the two loci must
be separated by no less than 580 kilobases of intervening

Page 7 of 13

sequence. Both of the Grh loci are represented by multiple ESTs (NevGRH1, EST cluster: 2655293_3; NevGRH2,
EST cluster: 2664076_1), and none of the individual ESTs
overlap (thus, there is no evidence for trans-splicing).
Potential homologs in plants?

Given that the origin of the LSF/GRH family predates the
divergence of animals and fungi, we searched for LSF and
GRH homologs in amoebozoans and plants to see if this
gene family might predate the origin of opisthokonts.
Plant genomes and amoebozoan genomes do not appear
to encode any proteins with extensive similarity to the
LSF/GRH proteins of animals and fungi. In tblastn

lengthy inter-motif regions, which were truncated by 50% (0.5Ã). Thin colored lines highlight motif conservation between proteins. The relative relationships among taxa depicted here reflect a general consensus among molecular phylogenetic analyses [62-68], although there continues to be controversy surrounding key elements of the phylogeny including the placement of ctenophores [69] and the monophyly of the triploblasts [70-72].

(E value 0.07), and the amoebozoan Dictyostelium purpureum yielded a hit for LSF (E value 0.04; Additional file
3). When the top hit from Selaginella and Dictyostelium
were BLASTed back against the human genome, the
search yielded no significant hits.

Discussion
Evolutionary origins of the LSF/GRH family and subfamilies

Prior to the present study, members of the LSF/GRH
family had been reported from a number of triploblastic
animals but not from diploblastic animals, choanoflagellates, or fungi. We recovered clear LSF and GRH
orthologs from two diploblastic animals (sea anemone
and sponge) revealing that the evolutionary divergence
between these two subfamilies must have predated the
diploblast-triploblast split. Furthermore, fungi possess
clear LSF/GRH homologs, although the fungal sequences
cannot be assigned to either the LSF or GRH subfamilies.
Therefore, while the family clearly originated prior to the
metazoan-fungal divergence, the diversification of sub-

families occurred more recently, perhaps in an ancient
animal lineage.
Nev-GRH1 and Nev-GRH2

The sea anemone, Nematostella vectensis, is the only species where the sequences encoding the ancestral GRH
protein are known to be split between two loci. As
sponges, ctenophores, and triploblasts exhibit full-length
GRH proteins, this condition must be derived in the sea
anemone. The splitting of the ancestral Grh locus in
Nematostella must have profound consequences for the
regulation and function of GRH. In other animals, GRH
binds DNA targets as a dimer. However, in Nematostella,
the DNA-binding domain and the oligomerization reside
on different proteins. Perhaps Nev-GRH1 is able to interact with the DNA singly, or perhaps a partnership with
Nev-GRH2 allows it to form the equivalent of a GRHdimer on DNA, reminiscent of other GRH proteins. This
latter possibility implies that Nev-GRH1 and Nev-GRH2
will be co-expressed in the same cells. This will need to be
confirmed experimentally. Interestingly, a comparable
split seems to have occurred in the NF-ÎºB gene of this
species, with distinct loci encoding different functional
domains of the ancestral protein [49].

Identification of LSF/GRH Homologs in Fungi

Convincing matches to human LSF and/or GRH query
sequences were found in the genomes of representative
ascomycote, basiomycote and zygomycote fungi (Table
1). The phylum Basiomycota is the sister group to the
phylum Ascomycota, with the Zygomycota being more
distantly related [50], and the phylogenetic analysis we
performed grouped the LSF-like proteins of the ascomycotes Aspergillus, Mycosphaerella, and Trichoderma to
the exclusion of the LSF-like proteins from the zygomycote Phycomyces. In the MEME analysis, the two LSF/
GRH proteins identified in the zygomycote Phycomyces
were found to possess all of the conserved motifs that
were identified within the DNA-binding domain of animals (motifs 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11). The two LSF/GRH
proteins of the ascomycote, Aspergillus, also possess
motifs 4, 5, 9, 10, and 11, but in place of motif 6, these
proteins share motifs 7 and 8, which are unique to this

fungus. All four fungal sequences subjected to the MEME
analysis were found to contain motif 19, which corresponds to the dimerization domain. Given the strong
conservation of motifs between fungi and animals in the
DNA-binding and dimerization domains, we hypothesize
that the molecular function of these fungal proteins will
be very similar to their animal homologs, i.e., they are
transcription factors that will bind DNA targets, most
likely as dimers (like GRH). However, if the novel fungalspecific motifs functionally replace the SAM domain,
which is likely to represent the second protein-protein
interaction domain in LSF subfamily members, they
might instead bind DNA as tetramers (like LSF).
Insights into the hypothesized ancestral role of GRH from
basal animals

Because GRH plays a comparable role in the maintenance
and repair of the surface epithelium in mouse [22],
clawed frog [13], fruit fly [23], and soil nematode [15], it

Figure 4 Mapping of Nev-Grh1 and Nev-Grh2 ESTs to separate loci. The NevGrh1 and NevGrh2 loci (enclosed in boxes) are flanked by distinct genes
and are found on distinct, non-overlapping genomic scaffolds. Exons are indicated by black boxes, and introns are represented by solid black lines.

has been hypothesized that this role is homologous
among triploblastic bilaterians [21,24]. Given that the
shared possession of an epithelium is thought to be
homologous across the Metazoa, it is possible that the
functional evolution of GRH is connected to the origin
and early evolution of the epithelium. The presence of an
epithelial boundary is a plesiomorphic character of
triploblastic animals, and therefore, we cannot explore
the early evolution of animal epithelia using only triploblastic model systems. The identification of clear GRH
homologs in cnidarians, ctenophores, and sponges, and
the apparent absence of a true Grh gene in the choanoflagellate Monosiga suggests the origin of Grh may be coincident with the origin of the metazoan epithelium.
Historically, sponges have been said to lack an epithelium, but more recently, the identification of a genuine
basement membrane in homoscleromorph sponges
removes this distinction between poriferans and other
metazoans [51]. If the role of Grh in maintaining epithelial integrity dates to the origin of the epithelium, then
Grh should be expressed in the epidermal epithelium of
cnidarians, ctenophores and sponges. Furthermore, Grh
should regulate proteins involved in epithelial differentiation and maintenance, although the exact targets of Grh
transcriptional regulation may vary among basal animals
as they vary among triploblasts. Additionally, we may
expect that Grh will be upregulated in response to injury,
while knockdown of Grh expression may undermine epithelial integrity and inhibit wound healing. All of these
questions are amenable to testing in one or more basal
model systems.

Conclusions
The LSF/GRH family had already originated by the time
of the opisthokont ancestor, and the overall domain

architecture of LSF/GRH proteins has been largely conserved in extant fungi, animals, and choanoflagellates.
The LSF subfamily had diverged from the GRH family
prior to the divergence of sponges, cnidarians, and triploblastic animals. Consistent differences in domain architecture distinguish the LSF and GRH proteins of both
diploblastic and triploblastic animals, suggesting that the
functional divergence between these proteins had been
established prior to the evolutionary divergence between
diploblasts and triploblasts. The sea anemone Nematostella appears unique in that the DNA-binding domain
and the dimerization domain of the ancestral GRH protein are now encoded on two separate loci.

Methods
Identification of LSF/Grainyhead family members in
outgroup taxa

The human proteins LSF [NP_005644.2] and GRHL2
[AAH69633.1] were used to query online genomic databases (Joint Genome Institute Eukaryotic Genomes and
NCBI) for LSF-like and GRH-like proteins respectively
using BlastP. The following search settings were
employed: gap opening penalty = 11; gap extension penalty = 1. Potential homologs that matched one of the
query sequences with an expectation score < e-1 were
used to query the human genome (using BLASTp) to
determine if their top human match was to the original
human query sequence (LSF or GRHL2). Sequences were
kept for phylogenetic and protein motif identification
only if they met this criterion.
Protein motif identification

To identify conserved protein motifs, LSF/GRH proteins
were evaluated using MEME (Multiple Expectation Maximization for Motif Elicitation; http://meme.nbcr.net;

Traylor-Knowles et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:101
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/101

([52]; Additional file 1). LSF/GRH family members were
chosen to represent ten metazoan phyla, the choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis, an ascomycote fungus
(Aspergillus) and a zygomycote fungus (Phycomyces;
Table 1). The following settings were used in the motif
search: maximum number of motifs = 20; occurrences of
a single motif = any number; minimum length of a motif
= 3 amino acids; maximum length of a motif = 300.
Multisequence Alignment

Twenty-eight of the twenty-nine LSF/GRH protein
sequences included in the MEME analysis were aligned in
preparation for phylogenetic analysis (Additional file 4).
The GRH2 protein of Nematostella vectensis was
excluded from the alignment because it is substantially
truncated relative to the full-length LSF and GRH proteins of other animals. Since motif 4 was identified near
the amino terminal of all but three of the proteins, and
motif 19 was identified near the carboxy terminal of all
but one of the proteins (Figure 1), these motifs were used
to bracket the alignment. To ensure that the motifs identified by MEME were maintained in register, the motifs
themselves were manually aligned. Then, the regions
between conserved motifs were multiply aligned using
the Clustal alignment tool found in the application
MEGA [53]. The following settings were specified: protein weight matrix = Gonnet, gap opening penalty = 10;
gap extension penalty = 0.2. The resulting alignment
spans 2045 characters. All positions in the alignment
containing gaps were deleted to produce a gap-free alignment comprising 44 characters (Additional file 4).
Phylogenetic Analysis

Phylogenetic relationships among taxa were inferred
from both the gap-free alignment and the full alignment
using neighbor-joining [54] and maximum-likelihood
[55]. All 44 residues in the gap-free alignment derive from
motifs 9-11, which are part of the DNA-binding domain
(Additional file 2). First, eighty alternate models of the
amino acid substitution process were compared using the
program ProtTest 1.3 [56]. The substitution process was
optimized along with the tree topology and branch
lengths. For both the full alignment and the gap-free
alignment, the empirically determined JTT substitution
matrix [57] outperformed other substitution matrices,
and incorporating rate variation among sites significantly
improved the model (the shape coefficient of the Gamma
distribution, Î± = .837; the coefficient of rate variation
among sites = 1/Î±1/2 = 1.093). The JTT matrix with
gamma-distributed rate variation among sites was specified in subsequent phylogenetic analyses.
For the neighbor joining analysis, pairwise distances
between proteins were calculated using the Prodist program, and the tree topology was determined using the

Page 11 of 13

Neighbor program, both in the Phylip package (v. 3.6;
[58]). Maximum-likelihood analysis was performed using
RAxML (v 7.0.3; [59]) as implemented on the CIPRES
Portal (v. 2.0; [60]). In both the neighbor-joining analysis
and the maximum-likelihood analysis, support for specific clades was assessed using the bootstrap [61]: 1,000
replicates of the bootstrap were performed for the neighbor-joining analysis, and 100 replicates were performed
for the maximum-likelihood analysis.

Additional file 3 The assembled genomes ofChlamydomonas reinhardtii,

(>gi|21361278|ref|NP_005644.2| transcription factor CP2) and GRH
sequence (>gi|46854865|gb|AAH69633.1| GRHL2 protein). A permissive E value cut-off was specified (e-1). Dictyostelium and Chlamydomonas
each returned a single hit for LSF, and Selaginella returned a single hit for
GRH.
