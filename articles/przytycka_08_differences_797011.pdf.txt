Abstract
Background: In highly conserved widely distributed ortholog groups, the main evolutionary force
is assumed to be purifying selection that enforces sequence conservation, with most divergence
occurring by accumulation of neutral substitutions. Using a set of ortholog groups from
prokaryotes, with a single representative in each studied organism, we asked the question if this
evolutionary pressure is acting similarly on different subgroups of orthologs defined as major
lineages (e.g. Proteobacteria or Firmicutes).
Results: Using correlations in entropy measures as a proxy for evolutionary pressure, we
observed two distinct behaviors within our ortholog collection. The first subset of ortholog groups,
called here informational, consisted mostly of proteins associated with information processing (i.e.
translation, transcription, DNA replication) and the second, the non-informational ortholog
groups, mostly comprised of proteins involved in metabolic pathways. The evolutionary pressure
acting on non-informational proteins is more uniform relative to their informational counterparts.
The non-informational proteins show higher level of correlation between entropy profiles and
more uniformity across subgroups.
Conclusion: The low correlation of entropy profiles in the informational ortholog groups suggest
that the evolutionary pressure acting on the informational ortholog groups is not uniform across
different clades considered this study. This might suggest "fine-tuning" of informational proteins in
each lineage leading to lineage-specific differences in selection. This, in turn, could make these
proteins less exchangeable between lineages. In contrast, the uniformity of the selective pressure
acting on the non-informational groups might allow the exchange of the genetic material via lateral
gene transfer.

1. Background
Previous studies have shown that proteins are under purifying selection which enforces a certain stasis in terms of
sequence and function. Much less frequently they are subject to episodes of positive selection, which are typified by

accelerated sequence divergence and corresponding functional shifts [1-6]. A basic assumption in molecular evolution is that the selective pressure represents functional
constraints and is correlated with evolutionary conservation [2]. Direct measurement of the functional constraints

is not straight-forward; however its effects may be estimated through sequence conservation. For closely related
species, selective pressure is usually measured using a
nucleotide alignment and the ratio of non-synonymous
over synonymous (silent) substitutions [7,8]. For more
divergent species, the purifying selective pressure can be
measured through the imprint it makes on the multiple
sequence alignment of proteins in an ortholog group.

tion in Ks/Kn ratio) nor the reasons for which the constraints might be different in different clades. Possible
reasons may vary from differences in the environment to
lineage specific "fine tuning" of proteins functioning as
parts of multi-protein complexes. To emphasize the connection to evolution on longer distances selective constraints measured in this way are also referred to as
evolutionary pressure [10,11].

We consider a set of ortholog groups, which are conserved
over a broad spectrum of prokaryotes. We additionally
require that selected proteins do not have paralogs in
studied organisms. Hence a change in biological function
of the proteins within each group is unlikely. Within such
an ortholog group, the general expectation is that the
main evolutionary force is purifying selection, which is
reflected as sequence conservation, with most divergence
between the orthologs arising from neutral substitutions.
Sequences in a given ortholog group can be further
divided into subgroups each comprised of different
monophyletic lineages, for example Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Archaea. We were interested in understanding whether the selective pressure was similar across the
different subgroups, and if the measure of selective pressure acting on one subgroup is predictive of that acting on
another within the same ortholog group. We present
results of this study and provide evidence that Lateral
Gene Transfer (LGT) might have a noticeable, apparently
non-intuitive, effect on such extrapolations of selective
pressure. We outline below the basic approach used in
this study.

We represent variability in sequence conservation by an
entropy profile – a vector constructed from multiple
sequence alignment where the value at the ith position in
the vector equals the entropy of the corresponding column in the alignment. Thus the entries of the entropy profile vary with the sequence conservation. Consequently,
given two subfamilies, it can be tested if their entropy profiles are correlated. Such correlation would be expected if
both subfamilies ware subjected to the same evolutionary
pressure.

Approach
Selective pressure, defined as the influence of natural
selection in enforcing conservation or in favoring divergence in protein or DNA sequence, has been a observed to
be the basis for conservation patterns across different subfamilies in a family of homologous molecules [9]. It has
been measured previously using the entropy of individual
positions in multiple sequence alignment as a proxy [911].

The ortholog groups used in this study satisfies the
uniqueness condition, i.e. none of the proteins has a confounding paralog within the same genome, which cannot
be differentiated from the true ortholog. Therefore, it is
prudent to assume that proteins from such ortholog
group perform a comparable function in the corresponding organisms. Consequently, significant deviations from
the uniformity in the pattern of sequence conservation in
different subgroups can be attributed to differences in
effects of selection within these subgroups. We stress that
observed differences in the sequence conservation patterns do not directly provide information on the causes
for the inferred differences (for example in terms of varia-

It is important to keep in mind that entropy profile is
shaped not only by selective constraints but also by evolutionary distances between the species. We control for this
dependency by keeping the set of species fixed for all
ortholog groups under study.
An ultimate test for uniformity of evolutionary constraints
would require that one can predict the evolutionary pressure imposed on sequences in one subgroup X of an
ortholog group based on information on a different subgroup, N (kNown), of this group. In this work, rather than
predicting the entropy profile of X from the entropy profile of N we focus on the more modest task of predicting
the Pearson's correlation coefficient, cc(N, X) between
them. The value of the Pearson's correlation coefficient of
entropy profiles of two subgroups of the same ortholog
group provides a first estimation of the uniformity of the
selective pressure between the groups. In contrast to evolutionary distance measures, correlation coefficient
depends not only on the amount of evolutionary changes
but also on the location of these changes in protein
sequence.
We cast the question of uniformity of the evolutionary
pressure within an ortholog group as a general question of
predictability of the value of the correlation coefficient
between entropy profiles of two its subgroups. More precisely, we ask if the Pearson's correlation coefficient, cc(N,
X), between entropy profiles of two subgroups N and X
can be expressed as a function of some measurable property (or properties) of ortholog subgroup N. We selected
three such measurable properties: one "global", one
"local" and one "semi-local" (Figure 1). For each of these
three measurements we tested if the value of cc(N, X), is
correlated (positively or negatively) with the given meas-

urement. The first measurement (Figure 1a) is a value that
approximates the ratio of the distance between the last
common ancestors of the genes in subgroups X and N to
the average distance between sequences from different
subgroups. Thus this measurement uses information
about both subgroups X and N and therefore we classified
it as a global property. The second measurement estimates
the level of conservation of sequences in N (Figure 1b).
We defined this measurement as a local measurement, as
it does not require any knowledge of the ortholog group
beyond the properties of the sequences in the subgroup N.
We estimated the conservation within ortholog subgroup,
X, using two measures: average entropy and percent of
perfectly conserved columns. Finally, the last, semi-local,
measurement is based on value cc(N, Y) computed for N
and another subgroup Y different from X (Figure 1c). So
while it uses information about sequences other than
these in the subgroup N (thus it is not local), however it
doesn't use sequences in the subgroup X.
To delineate the relation between lateral gene transfer and
universality of selective constraints, we identified the subset of ortholog groups with putative lateral gene transfers
between different clades and examined specific properties
of this set. Additionally, we performed a series of in-silico
lateral gene transfers (s-LGTs). In these experiments a random member of a given subgroup is replaced with a random member from another subgroup of the same
ortholog group. Then we measured the effect of such sLGT on the correlation coefficient.

2. Results and discussion
This study utilizes three prokaryotic clades: Archaea, Proteobacteria, and Gram positive bacteria. In this paper we
use A, P, and G to denote the subgroup of an ortholgy
group restricted to the given clade (Archaea, Proteobacteria, and Gram positive bacteria respectively). The ortholog
groups were extracted based on the COG database [12]
and were filtered so that that each ortholog group has a
unique homolog in each of the selected organisms. Such
stringent restriction leads to the trade-off between the
number of species in a clade and the number of ortholog
groups in the study. After confirming high correlation
between values of cc(N, X) for four and six species (R2 was
86, 78, 80 depending on N and X, [see Additional file 1])
we concluded using the four-element clades should still
provide reliable result and at the same time allow for considering a broader range of ortholog groups (see Methods). The set of 63 ortholog groups obtained in this way
was divided further into the "informational groups" containing 37 ortholog groups associated with functions
related to information processing (i.e. translation, ribosomal proteins, transcription, DNA replication) and the
"non-informational groups" containing 26 remaining

ortholog groups, which are mostly proteins involved in
metabolism (see Additional file 2 for full description).
2.1. Negative correlation of cc(N, X) and the relative root
distance – global measurement
First, we tested if cc(N, X) can be predicted from the information encoded in the phylogenic tree of the ortholog
group. Specifically, we used a value referred to as the relative root distance r(N, X), approximating the ratio of the
distance between last common ancestors of the two subgroups to the average evolutionary distances of the
sequences in the two subgroups (see Methods for definition). Note, that by relying on the phylogenetic tree, this
test uses information about both subgroups N and X.
Thus this constitutes a global measurement of the
ortholog groups (Figure 1a). We observed a negative correlation between cc(N, X) and the relative root distance
r(N, X) (Figure 2). The coefficient of determination, R2,
when one of the two subgroups belonged to Archaea ((G,
A) and (P, A)) was respectively 0.74 and 0.72, while that
where both subgroups corresponded to bacterial clades
was 0.25. Hence, the value of r(N, X) is negatively correlated with cc(N, X) and thus can be used to predict the latter value. However, since r(N, X) is a global measure that
uses information on both N and X we cannot conclude
that cc(N, X) can be predicted from N alone.

This experiment suggested a strong dependency of the
similarity of entropy profiles on the shape of the ortholog
tree. In addition, it pointed out the first of a series of differences in the properties of the informational and noninformational groups: the relative root distances in the set
of informational groups are on average larger than the relative root distances in the set of non-informational groups
(see summary in Table 1).
2.2. Dependency of cc(N, X) on sequence conservation in
group N- local measurement
The previous test demonstrated a negative correlation
between the relative root distance r(N, X) computed on
the basis of pairwise distances between protein sequences
in X and N and cc(N, X). Next, we tested if cc(N, X) is correlated with sequence divergence within the ortholog subgroup N (Figure 1b). For this purpose, we measured the
correlation between negated average entropy E(N) of the
subgroup N and the value of cc(N, X), for all choices of N
and X (six experiments). We performed the same set of
experiment using the percentage of perfectly conserved
columns in N, PC(N), instead of E(N). We found that the
two measures are strongly correlated (R2 > 0.95 for all subgroups) and the results obtained using with either of the
two measures were very consistent. Therefore, we focused
on the relation between E(N) and cc(N, X). Out of the six
experiments only pairs E(P), cc(A, P)) and (E(G), cc(A, G))
were correlated with R2 > 0.1 (0.17 and 0.38 respectively).

Subsequently, we focused on comparing average properties of informational and non-informational groups.
Although, on average, the entropy of non-informational
subgroups is higher than that of informational subgroups
(and the percent conservation lower) the difference is not
statistically significant. In contrast, the values of cc(N, X)
are significantly higher for non-informational groups
(Table 1). This clear difference between the two ortholog
groups is suggestive non-uniformity of constraints on the
informational groups. These constraints might preserve
certain mutations specific to particular subgroups within
the informational ortholog groups. Another striking
observation was that for non-informational ortholog
groups, the average correlation coefficient is approximately the same for all pairs of clades suggesting an additional level of uniformity of the these groups.
2.3. Uncovering the relation between the cc(N, X) for
different pairs of subgroups – semi-local measurement
Given the above observations, we sought to understand
the separation of informational and non-informational
groups in greater detail. We observed a reasonable correlation of our global measurement, relative root distance
r(N, X), and cc(N, X) (Section 2.1). In contrast, the correlation between our local measurement, average entropy,
E(N) and cc(N, X) was very low (Section 2.2). Therefore
we considered an intermediate, semi-local, measurement
of ortholog groups (Figure 1c). Specifically, we studied the
dependency of the correlation cc(N, X) between and cc(N,
Y) where N, X, and Y are different subgroups of the same
ortholog group corresponding to distinct clades. The coefficients of determination, R2, for the correlation between
cc(N, Y) and cc(N, X) for the three possible combinations
of subgroups were 0.78, 0.27 and 0.19 depending on the

subgroups, with the highest correlation for the pair (cc(A,
G), cc(A, P)) and the lowest for the pair (cc(P, G), cc(P, A))
(Figure 3). Just as in the previous measurements, we
found that informational and non-informational proteins
have a distinct behavior with respect to this measure – the
values for non-informational groups showed higher correlation. Specifically, the R2 values for non-informational
groups are 0.68, 0.27 and 0.31 (listed in the same order as
above) while the corresponding values for the informational groups are 0.54, 0.11 and 0.02.
This provides yet more evidence for the observation that
evolutionary pressure acts more uniformly on the noninformational groups than on the informational groups.
These results also give further support to the observation
that a significant fraction of the informational ortholog
groups might be a subject to lineage specific evolutionary
pressure. If so, this would imply that proteins in this
group are not easily exchangeable between species
through LGT. In contrast, the selective pressure acting on
non-informational proteins is much more uniform and
may more easily permit exchange of corresponding
orthologs and corresponding xenologous displacement
[13].
2.4. Lateral gene transfer and evolutionary pressure
The above observations suggested that proteins in informational ortholog groups may be less prone to exchange
between lineages, while exchanges in the non-informational groups are more likely. To test if this indeed is the
case, we constructed evolutionary trees for all ortholog
groups and manually looked for deviations from the species tree, which would imply lateral gene transfer (LGT)
between the clades (see Material and methods). We found

that only 3 out of 37 informational group trees had a signature of such putative LGTs while most (18 out of 27)
non-informational groups show such a signature of possible lateral gene transfer consistent with our expectation.
We found that non-informational groups have higher correlation between cc(N, X) and cc(N, Y) than informational
groups (Table 2). Surprisingly we observed lack of
increased correlation between cc(A, P); cc(A, G) for noninformational groups with LGT and even a drop when
only putative transfers from Archaea are considered. We
noted also that, the non-informational groups without
the above defined signature of LGT events show similar
basic characteristics as the non-informational groups with
such signature LGT.

the bacterial clades (A2G or A2P). R2 values for s-LGT are the
average over 100 simulations.

2.5. In-silico Lateral Gene Transfers (s-LGT) elucidate
unifying role of Lateral Gene Transfer
We then explored more deeply this relation between LGT
from Archaea to bacteria and the evolutionary pressure.
Specifically, we performed a series of in-silico lateral gene
transfers, s-LGT, where a random sequence from Proteobacteria or Gram-positive bacteria was replaced by a random sequence from Archaea. This process was repeated
100 times. Trends from the in-silico experiment agree
with the trends seen in the real data (Table 3). LGT does
not always increase the correlation between the values of
cc(N, X) and cc(N, Y) but can been seen as a unifying force
within ortholog group as illustrated in Figure 4. That is, if
we think of the correlation between (cc(N, X), cc(N, Y)) as
a measure of the angle between (N, X) and (N, Y) then sLGTs from Archaea shifts the triangle A, P, G towards the
equilateral shape (Figure 4).

of the subgroups. In contrast, the non-informational
groups display higher correlation between entropy profiles, and show more uniformity across subgroups. This
uniformity of the evolutionary pressure acting on the noninformational groups might allow gene exchange through
LGT. In contrast, the correlation between entropy profiles
for informational groups is very low. This suggested that
the informational proteins are not expected to be easily
exchangeable between species. We confirmed that this is
indeed the case for the ortholog groups under study. Thus
the low level of lateral gene transfers for informational
groups might be a result of distinct evolutionary pressure
acting on these highly conserved groups.

3. Conclusion
We considered the question if the evolutionary pressure
within a set of ortholog groups is act uniformly in different subgroups of each ortholog group. We observed a distinctly different behavior of two subsets of our ortholog
set, namely the informational and non-informational
ortholog groups. We established, through a number of
measurements, that evolutionary pressure acting on noninformational proteins is more uniform relative to their
informational counterparts. The informational proteins
show lower level of correlation between entropy profiles

It is important to bear in mind that the set of ortholog
groups considered in this study is very biased – all groups
are highly conserved with unique homolog in each
genome used in the study. In particular the behavior of
the non-informational groups considered in this study
does not necessarily generalize across all proteins that
excluded from the informational groups as defined here.
The informational ortholog groups in our study do not
cover all proteins related to information processing that
are present in these organisms. A substantial fraction of
these like specific transcription factors are left out because
they do not satisfy the conservation criteria used in our
study.

comparable chance of being transferred. It is at the level of
the fixation of the transferred gene depending on its ability to function non-disruptively or to the advantage of the
host system that differences could arise between the two
classes. Numerous cases of horizontal transfer were
reported amongst informational proteins, although less
frequently than in the non-informational set [15-18].
Thus LGT between informational proteins is readily possible. The difference in frequency of LGT is consistent with
the proposed differences in selective constraints which
results in rejection of most such transfers in a certain subset of the informational genes.

Jain et al. proposed that genes involved in multi-protein
complexes are expected to be rarely transferred [14].
Indeed, the fact that many informational proteins are
functioning as parts of multi-protein complexes is likely
to contribute to the unique selective constraints acting on
them. However a number of the ortholog groups in the
non-informational set also form complexes with other
proteins (e.g. NCAIR mutase, FGAM synthetase and
glutamine amidotransferase domains, Molybdenum
cofactor biosynthesis enzymes). Yet, the properties, such
as correlation between entropy profiles, of these proteins
are consistent with other proteins in the non-informational groups rather then with those in the informational
groups. This indicates that the selective constraints in the
informational groups have been imposed by a broader
spectrum of conditions and not just being present in complexes.
Alternatively, the difference in the correlation in entropy
profiles is a consequence of insufficient sampling of
sequence space in the informational groups due reduced
LGT, rather than a signature of a difference in evolutionary pressure. Such a possibility cannot be completely
excluded. However, it less unlikely that LGT is the primary
cause of those differences. For example, the difference in
the average entropy of informational and non-informational sets is not statistically significant so the level of
exploration of the sequence space is not drastically different. Furthermore, LGT is a stochastic process, with both
informational and non-informational groups having a

These observations combined with our results suggest that
the evolutionary pressure acting on the informational
ortholog groups is not uniform across different subgroups of organisms in this study. This might suggest
"fine-tuning" of these informational group proteins in
each lineage that makes them less exchangeable between
lineages. In part this might relate to them functioning as
parts of multi-protein complexes with several distinct subunits conserved subunits. In contrast, the non-informational groups might not experience such lineage-specific
differences in selective pressure as they usually catalyze
individual reactions in metabolic pathways with the flux
of substrates mediating most functional interactions
between them.

4. Methods
Dataset
The set of ortholog groups from the COG database [12]
was used. The COG database contains a total of 4873 clusters of orthologous groups (COGs) of proteins. Only
COGs containing at least n representative organisms each
in Archaea, Proteobacteria and Grampositive bacteria
were considered. To ensure that the ortholog groups
selected for this study contain sufficiently diverse organisms (to minimize the impact of redundancy during
entropy calculations), we considered only those COGs
containing organisms listed in Table 4. Because of this
limitation, the number of COGs under consideration fell
to 63 and 41 for n = 4 and 6, respectively (the complete
list is given in Additional file 2).
Constructing the multiple sequence alignments
Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of the protein
sequences in a COG were constructed using MUSCLE
[19]. For each ortholog group, MSAs corresponding to

only those organisms in Archaea, Proteobacteria, and
Gram positive bacteria (Table 4) were constructed by
extracting the corresponding set of rows in the ortholog
group alignment (Figure 5).
Constructing the entropy profiles and computing the
correlation between amino-acid entropy profiles
The entropy of each column in an alignment is computed
using AL2CO [20] with default parameters. Each alignment is represented using a conservation profile of length
equal to the length of the alignment, with the ith entry in
the profile representing the entropy of residues in the ith
position of the alignment and is computed as

C(i) = ∑ a =1 f a (i) ln f a (i) where fa(i) is the frequency of
20

amino acid a at position i. The entries are normalized by
subtracting the mean and dividing by standard deviation.
In order to eliminate the impact of gapped positions in
the alignments, we only consider those residue positions

(in the alignment) with < 50% gap in at least 2 of the 3
group alignments.
Each ortholog group under consideration is represented
using a set of three entropy profiles corresponding to the
three subgroups under consideration. The pairwise correlation of these 3 profiles is computed using Pearson's linear correlation coefficient.
Computing the evolutionary distance
For each ortholog group, the distance matrix is computed
from the multiple sequence alignment obtained with
MUSCLE [19] using two approaches: (i) maximum likelihood method using quartet puzzling approach [21,22].
and (ii) the programs available in the ClustalW suite [23]
(no correction for multiple substitutions was applied)
where the distances are computed based on percent identity scores. Positions with gaps are excluded as described
as described in computing entropy profile subsection. The
computed distances ware highly correlated (r2 between
0.95 and 0.98). Results included in the paper are obtained
using maximum likelihood method.

The average evolutionary distance between a member in
subgroup X and a member in subgroup Y is given by

∑ ∑ dist(i, j)
i∈X j∈Y
d ave ( X , Y ) =
,
f ( X ,Y )

where f(X, Y) = |X||Y| if X ≠ Y, and f(X, Y) = |X|! if X = Y.
Recall that |X|, |Y| = n. The relative group distance r(X, Y),
measuring the distance between the ancestors of members
in subgroup X and Y with respect to dave(X, Y), is given by

d ( X , X ) d ave (Y ,Y )
d ave ( X ,Y )− ave
−

r( X , Y ) =

d ave ( X ,Y )
where the numerator approximates the distance between
the ancestors of members in subgroup X and members in
subgroup Y (see Figure 6).
Lateral Gene Transfers
To identify putative LGT events, evolutionary tree for (12species) ortholog groups were constructed using ClustalW
suite [23], displayed with the TreeView program [24] and
checked manually for disagreements with the species tree.
Putative transfer from Archaea was assigned if a single bacterial gene was found in the Archaeal clade.
