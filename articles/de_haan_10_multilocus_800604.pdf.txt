Campylobacter jejuni isolates and their attribution
to human infections

Abstract
Background: Campylobacter jejuni is the most common bacterial cause of human gastroenteritis worldwide. Due
to the sporadic nature of infection, sources often remain unknown. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) has been
successfully applied to population genetics of Campylobacter jejuni and mathematical modelling can be applied to
the sequence data. Here, we analysed the population structure of a total of 250 Finnish C. jejuni isolates from
bovines, poultry meat and humans collected in 2003 using a combination of Bayesian clustering (BAPS software)
and phylogenetic analysis.
Results: In the first phase we analysed sequence types (STs) of 102 Finnish bovine C. jejuni isolates by MLST and
found a high diversity totalling 50 STs of which nearly half were novel. In the second phase we included MLST
data from domestic human isolates as well as poultry C. jejuni isolates from the same time period. Between the
human and bovine isolates we found an overlap of 72.2%, while 69% of the human isolates were overlapping with
the chicken isolates. In the BAPS analysis 44.3% of the human isolates were found in bovine-associated BAPS
clusters and 45.4% of the human isolates were found in the poultry-associated BAPS cluster. BAPS reflected the
phylogeny of our data very well.
Conclusions: These findings suggest that bovines and poultry were equally important as reservoirs for human
C. jejuni infections in Finland in 2003. Our results differ from those obtained in other countries where poultry has
been identified as the most important source for human infections. The low prevalence of C. jejuni in poultry flocks
in Finland could explain the lower attribution of human infection to poultry. Of the human isolates 10.3% were
found in clusters not associated with any host which warrants further investigation, with particular focus on
waterborne transmission routes and companion animals.

Background
Campylobacter jejuni is the most common bacterial
cause of human gastroenteritis worldwide [1]. In many
European countries, including Finland, the number of
laboratory confirmed C. jejuni infections doubled in the
last decade [2]. In Finland, approximately 4500 cases
were reported in 2008 [3], with an incidence of 85/100
000 inhabitants.
Campylobacter outbreaks are relatively uncommon in
industrialized countries, and most of the cases occur
sporadically [1]. As a consequence, the sources of infection remain mostly unknown. Epidemiological studies in

different countries indicate that eating improperly
cooked meat and handling chicken carcasses are important risk factors for acquiring the illness [1,4]. Other
risk factors highlighted in epidemiological studies
include contact with pets [5], drinking untreated water
[4] and swimming in natural water sources [6].
Outbreaks of campylobacteriosis are most commonly
associated with drinking unpasteurized milk or contaminated water [7,8] and eating improperly cooked poultry
meat [9].
C. jejuni has a wide distribution among different
warm-blooded animals, including poultry, bovines, pigs,
cats, dogs and various wild animals [10,11] and birds.
As a consequence of faecal contamination, C. jejuni
is also frequently isolated from natural waters [12].

To estimate the proportion of human infections attributed to different sources of infection, various typing
methods have been applied to distinguish between
strains. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) has been
considered the method of choice due to its high discriminatory power; however, during the last decade - after
its description for C. jejuni - multilocus sequence typing
(MLST) [13] has generally been accepted as the most
suitable method for population genetic analyses. The
major advantages of MLST compared to PFGE are the
standardized nomenclature and the ability to easily
transfer and compare results between laboratories
worldwide. Furthermore, different mathematical modelling approaches can readily be applied on the resulting
sequence and allele data to facilitate source attribution.
For this purpose, different Bayesian approaches, inferring the genetic population structure of C. jejuni, have
garnered the most interest [14-17]. Bayesian Analysis of
Population Structure (BAPS) [18-21] has recently been
successfully applied in inferring population structures of
E. coli [22] and the S. mitis group streptococci [23].
BAPS showed, in a simulation study, comparable power
to other methods and was deemed also to be highly efficient from computational perspective [24].
Limited data exists on sequence types (STs) present
among bovine isolates in Finland [25], and estimating the
proportion of human infections potentially linked to this
source has been difficult. To better understand the diversity of Finnish bovine C. jejuni, we characterized 102 isolates using MLST. We used BAPS v. 5.3 for source
attribution purposes and included additional MLST data
obtained in our previous study [25] from Finnish bovines,
retail poultry meat and human isolates from 2003.

Results
MLST of bovine isolates

Genotypes of a total of 102 bovine C. jejuni isolates
were identified by nucleotide sequences at all seven
MLST loci. Ninety-three of these were assigned into
nine previously described clonal complexes (CCs) (Table
1). The ST-21 CC was predominant (51%), followed by
the ST-61 CC (17.6%), the ST-45 CC (10.8%), the ST-48
CC (4.9%) and the ST-677 CC (2.9%). Of the 50 STs
observed among the isolates, 23 (46%) were novel.
Thirty-two isolates (31.4%) had a unique ST, and the
most common STs among the isolates were ST-53
(12.7%), followed by ST-61 (7.8%) and ST-883 (6.9%).

structure analysis. The 74 STs were found among 13
CCs and the most common CCs were the ST-21 CC
(39.6%), the ST-45 CC (30.0%), the ST-61 CC (8.0%),
the ST-677 CC (4.4%) and the ST-48 CC (2.4%). The
predominant STs were ST-45 (23.2%), ST-50 (16.8%),
ST-53 (6.4%), ST-61 (4%) and ST-883 (3.6%).
Overall, 13.3% and 87.8% of the STs found in bovine
and poultry isolates, respectively, were also found in
human isolates. Conversely, 72.2% and 69% of the STs
found in human isolates were also found in bovine and
poultry isolates, respectively. Furthermore, 81.8% of the
STs found in poultry were found in bovine isolates, but
only 7.5% of those in bovines were present in poultry
isolates.
In analysing the relationships of clonal complexes with
hosts, the ST-21 (p < 0.01) and ST-61 CCs (p < 0.0001)
were associated with bovine isolates, whereas the ST-45
CC was associated with poultry (p < 0.0001) and human
isolates (p < 0.001). Bovine isolates were found in bovineassociated CCs in 65.8% of the cases. Poultry and human
isolates were found in the ST-21 CC in 15.1% and 36% of
the cases, respectively. The ST-61 CC did not occur
among poultry and human isolates. The ST-45 CC contained 69.7% of all the poultry isolates, 40.2% of the
human isolates and 10.8% of the bovine isolates.
ST-61 (p < 0.001), ST-53 (p < 0.0001), ST-58 (p =
0.01), ST-451 (p = 0.02) and ST-883 (p = 0.001) were
associated with the bovine host and contained 38.3% of
the bovine isolates. None of the human or poultry isolates represented bovine-associated STs. ST-45 was associated with poultry (p < 0.0001) and human isolates (p <
0.01) and was found in 66.7% of the poultry isolates,
32% of the human isolates and 4.2% of the bovine isolates. ST-50 was associated with human isolates (p <
0.0001) and was found in 34% of the human isolates,
15.1% of the poultry isolates and 3.3% of the bovine isolates. ST-137 was associated with the human isolates
(p < 0.01), but was absent from both other sources.

Using BAPS, nearly all estimation runs converged to
the same solution with five clusters having high posterior certainty in its vicinity according to the program
output. BAPS clusters 1 and 4 contained the majority of
isolates (86.8%). BAPS cluster 1 contained all STs found
in the ST-22, ST-45, ST-48, ST-283, and ST-658 CCs in
addition to two significantly admixed STs in the ST-21
CC (Table 2). One ST of the ST-48 (ST-2955) and ST658 CCs (ST-1967) was admixed as well. BAPS cluster 2
contained a total of three unassigned STs which were
only found in human isolates. In BAPS cluster 3 the ST677 CC was grouped together with two uncommon,
unassigned STs. BAPS cluster 4 comprised all, but two,
STs of the ST-21 CC, all STs from the ST-52, ST-206,
ST-257 and ST-1287 CCs and one ST (ST-618) from
the ST-61 CC, which was significantly admixed. The
remainder of the ST-61 CC formed a distinct cluster
(cluster 5), with no admixed STs and contained only
bovine isolates.
Admixture was mainly found in clusters 1 and 4 for a
total of nine STs (12.2%) including a total of 18 isolates
(7.2%). Mainly novel STs in the ST-21 complex (two
STs), ST-48 complex (one ST), ST-658 complex (one
ST), ST-1962 and ST-1970 were found to be admixed.
However, also ST-618 (ST-61 CC), ST-945 (ST-1287
CC) and ST-58 (unassigned) were significantly admixed.
Bovine isolates were found to be associated with admixture (p = 0.05).
BAPS clusters 4 and 5 were associated with the bovine
isolates (Table 2), BAPS cluster 1 was associated with
the poultry isolates and BAPS clusters 2 and 3 were not
associated with any host. Bovine isolates were found in
bovine-associated clusters in 71.7% of cases. Of the
poultry isolates 72.7% were found in the poultry-associated cluster. Human isolates were found in the
bovine-associated BAPS cluster 4 in 44.3% of the cases
and in 45.4% of the cases found in the poultry-associated BAPS cluster 1.
The NJ tree shown in Figure 1 illustrates the molecular variation within and between the clusters estimated
by BAPS from a phylogenetic perspective. eBURST analysis yielded seven groups containing two (smallest
group) to 12 (biggest group) STs and 34 singletons.
Table 3 shows the degree of similarity between the
eBURST groups and BAPS populations. The biggest
BAPS clusters (1 and 4) were made up of several
eBURST groups, while BAPS cluster 2 did not have an
equivalent eBURST group.

Discussion
Our study revealed a high diversity of MLSTs among
102 bovine C. jejuni isolates obtained from three major
Finnish slaughterhouses, representing 81 farms, in 2003.
A total of 50 STs (nine CCs) were observed, nearly half

of which were novel, emerging mostly from new combinations of known alleles and in two cases from new
alleles carrying a one-nucleotide difference from alleles
commonly found in cattle (pgm allele 2, tkt allele 1 and
uncA allele 17). The emergence of a high number of
novel STs could be explained by the life cycle of dairy
cattle, providing a C. jejuni strain with the opportunity
for long-lasting colonization and adaptation in the
bovine host. However, re-infection with a different strain
or multiple strains, and thus the occurrence of recombination events, cannot be excluded. The distribution of
C. jejuni genotypes has previously been shown not to be
random among farms, with farms no more than 1 km

apart appearing to possess similar C. jejuni genotypes
[12,26], supporting the persistence of clones in cattle
herds. Probably due to the disperse distribution of farms
in Finland, we found no clear evidence of regional differences in the distribution of bovine STs or CCs
between different parts of the country. This is in agreement with findings from Scotland [27].
In this study, as well as previous studies, the ST-21
and ST-61 CCs were shown to be common in cattle
[10,28]. The ST-61 CC, in particular, is strongly associated with bovines and has been observed in cattle in
other studies worldwide [10,12,15,28-33]. We did not

find members of the ST-61 CC in poultry or humans
[25], and other studies have infrequently observed this
CC in these hosts [28,31,32,34]. Also, ST-58 was one of
the most prevalent bovine STs (5%) in our study, and
STs that share five or more alleles with ST-58 (e.g. ST2683, ST-3098, ST-3365, ST-3426, ST-3432 and ST3443), have previously been reported only from cattle in
the UK and Ireland [35] and Scotland [27]. In addition
to STs in the ST-61 CC, ST-58 may represent another
clonal lineage of C. jejuni adapted to the bovine gut.
Source attribution is an important task in the risk
assessment of the impact of different potential reservoirs
for human infections caused by C. jejuni, and MLST has
been shown to be an efficient method for assessing clusters of isolates with host specificity [36]. On clonal complex level 65.8% of the bovine isolates were found in
bovine-associated CCs and 69.7% of the poultry isolates
were found in poultry-associated CCs. However, on ST
level only 38.3% of the bovine isolates were found in
bovine-associated STs, reflecting the high diversity of
STs found in bovine isolates within clonal complexes. In
addition, we used BAPS, a tool that has recently become
popular for inferring population genetic structure
[18,19,21] to assign our isolates to genetically differentiated groups. BAPS divided the 74 STs into five clusters
such that clusters 1 and 4 contained all STs which
BAPS identified as mosaics due to recombination. Of
the bovine isolates 71.7% were found in the bovine-associated BAPS clusters 4 and 5. Similarly, poultry isolates
were found in 72.7% of the cases in the poultry-associated BAPS cluster 1. These results indicate that BAPS
was useful for host assignment, even though our dataset
was relatively small. BAPS analysis showed comparable
power to host assignment using clonal complexes but
also reflected the phylogeny of our data.
BAPS clusters 1 and 4 contained most of the isolates
and were substantially heterogeneous in the distribution
of clonal complexes. Especially, the poultry-associated
BAPS cluster 1 was very heterogeneous; the ST-45 CC
was most common and grouped together with several
uncommon, unrelated clonal complexes, often not
found in our poultry isolates. In our previous study [25],
the ST-45 CC found in our human isolates was associated with tasting of raw or undercooked meat as well
as contact with dogs or cats. Also, the ST-45 CC has
been found from penguins on the Antarctic [37], implying that this CC has a wide host range and is environmentally well adapted. The ST-22, ST-42 and ST-48
CCs, which were grouped together with the ST-45 CC
in BAPS cluster 1, have been commonly found in companion animals in other studies [11,28,38]. However,
more studies are needed to establish the role of environmental contamination sources serving as C. jejuni vectors for both human infection and chicken colonization.

Most admixture was found in clusters 1 and 4 with
the majority of admixed STs being novel and associated
with the bovine isolates. All admixed STs with the highest posterior probability in cluster 1 (poultry-associated)
were admixed with cluster 4 (bovine-associated) and
most of these STs were found only in bovine isolates. In
contrast, most admixed STs with the highest posterior
probability in cluster 4 were admixed with clusters 2
and 3, in which only human isolates were assigned to
and mostly contained uncommon, unassigned STs.
These findings could imply that recombination is more
common in STs specific to bovines, which is supported
by the high diversity of our bovine isolates. Bovines
have a longer life-span than poultry and persistence of
C. jejuni clones in herds and specific bovine-associated
lineages imply that these strains can adapt to long-lasting colonization, thereby increasing the chance of horizontal transfer of genetic material and recombination.
The ST-61 CC was found as a separate cluster (cluster
5) by BAPS, with the exception of ST-618 (cluster 4,
admixed with cluster 1). This finding was not surprising
since the ST-61 CC is known to have imported C. coli
alleles (e.g. uncA17) and therefore is phylogenetically
less related to other C. jejuni clonal complexes [39].
Both ST-618 and ST-3509 do not possess the uncA17
allele, but ST-3509 carries the uncA38 allele. This allele
is common in both the ST-61 CC and the C. coli related
ST-828 CC and likely the presence of this allele caused
ST-3509 to be included in BAPS cluster 5. ST-618, however, carries the uncA5 allele, which is commonly found
in both the ST-21 CC (cluster 4) and the ST-48 CC.
This explains why this particular ST was grouped
together with the ST-21 CC and at the same time
admixed with cluster 1. These results demonstrate that
the import of C. coli DNA can have a large impact on
the MLST analysis of C. jejuni strains and this should
be taken into account in source attribution studies.
Studies from the UK [15-17] and New Zealand [14];
have indicated that chicken (poultry) could attribute to
57-80%, cattle (and sheep) to 18-39%, and other, mainly
environmental, sources to 1-4% of all C. jejuni infections. Compared to these studies we found a lower
source attribution for chickens (45.4%) and a higher
source attribution for bovines (44.3%). This could be the
result of limited sampling of C. jejuni isolates from
chicken meat in our study and the fact that C. jejuni is
more difficult to detect by cultivation from meat compared to faecal samples. The meat samples, however,
represented all three major chicken meat producers and
were collected during the summer peak [25], when most
human C. jejuni infections occur in Finland [3]. The
national low prevalence of Campylobacter spp. in Finnish chicken flocks (6.5% in 2003) [2] in comparison to
other EU countries could lead to a different source

Page 6 of 9

attribution when compared to studies from other countries. In a Finnish slaughterhouse study, C. jejuni was
detected in 19.5% of the faecal samples and 3.5% of
bovine carcasses [40]. However, none of the C. jejuni
isolates from carcasses represented PFGE types similar
to human isolates [41]. Bovines could be an underestimated route for Campylobacter infections in Finland,
although foodborne transmission would be least likely.
However, transmission could occur through either direct
contact or environmental transmission by shared reservoirs for human patients and bovine C. jejuni strains.
A large proportion of our isolates (10.3%) could not
be attributed to any source (BAPS clusters 2 and 3).
More than half of these isolates represented the ST-677
CC, which has been detected in various hosts, including
starlings [42], rabbits, environmental waters, wild birds
and cattle [10]. In our previous study this CC was
related to drinking non-chlorinated water from a small
water plant or from natural water sources [25]. Faecal
contamination from wild animals and birds into natural
water sources is common and could be hypothesized to
have a pronounced role in human infections in summer
in our Finnish study region Uusimaa. This is also supported by the Finnish case-control study that identified
swimming and drinking from dug wells as important
risk factors for infection during summertime [6]. Therefore the role of different water-associated transmission
routes should not be underestimated in future attribution studies of Finnish domestically acquired C. jejuni
human infections.

Conclusions
Due to the wide distribution and occurrence of some
C. jejuni CCs and STs among different hosts, source
attribution is a complicated issue and Bayesian methods
are considered useful for quantitative probabilistic
assignment of STs to genetically related clusters. In our
study 71.7% of the bovine isolates and 72.7% of the
poultry isolates were found in clusters associated with
each host. Of the human isolates 44.3% was found in
the bovine-associated BAPS cluster 4 and 45.4% was
found in the poultry-associated cluster. Inclusion of
MLST data in detailed epidemiological case-control studies and parallel extensive regional sampling schemes
would greatly improve the attribution of human infections to the source and help develop specific control
schemes to limit the numbers of human infections.
Methods
Bovine isolates

A total of 102 C. jejuni isolates from bovine rectal samples isolated in a survey on Campylobacter spp. in Finnish cattle at slaughter in 2003 [40] were included
in this study. The isolation method included an

de Haan et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:200
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/200

enrichment stage in Bolton broth and subcultivation on
mCCDA as described by Hakkinen et al. [40]. Sampling
was performed over a 12-month period, and the frequency of sampling was determined on the basis of the
numbers of cattle slaughtered in each slaughterhouse to
ensure that the collection of isolates would represent
the bovine C. jejuni population in these slaughterhouses.
The isolates originated from clinically healthy cattle
from 81 farms in 5 of the 6 Finnish counties. They were
isolated in three slaughterhouses: one located in the
western and two in the eastern part of Finland. Isolates
were stored deep-frozen at -70°C in skimmed milk or
Brucella broth with 15% glycerol.
DNA extraction

The isolates were cultured on Brucella agar (BBL, Becton Dickinson, MD, USA) with 5% bovine, horse or
sheep blood and incubated under microaerobic conditions at 37°C for 48 h. The DNA was isolated with the
Wizard® Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega, WI,
USA), diluted to 10 ng/μl and stored at -20°C.
Multilocus sequence typing (MLST)

MLST was performed according to the method
described by Dingle et al [13]. The primers and settings
are described on the PubMLST website [35]. In addition, alternative primers described previously [38,43]
were used. In the event of unsuccessful PCR with the
primer sets in these schemes, other primer combinations
were chosen, and the annealing temperatures were
adjusted if necessary. MultiScreen PCR plates (Millipore,
MA, USA) were used to purify the PCR products.
Sequencing reactions were carried out by using the BigDye terminator v. 3.1 Ready Reaction Cycle Sequencing
Kit (Applied Biosystems Inc., CA, USA). The Agencourt
®CleanSEQ kit (Beckman Coulter Genomics, Takeley,
United Kingdom) was used for cleaning the reactions.
The sequencing products were run on an ABI3130XL
Genetic Analyzer or an ABI3730 DNA analyzer (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The sequences were
assembled using the Staden package [44] or the assembler implemented in BioNumerics v. 5.1 software. Allele
numbers, STs and CCs were assigned using the
PubMLST database [35]. New alleles and STs were submitted to the database.
Analysis of population structure and host assignment

The Bayesian program BAPS v. 5.3 [18,19,21], was used
to investigate the population genetic structure by clustering STs into genetically differentiated groups and
evaluating them to predict the sources of human campylobacteriosis. For the analysis, the sequences of the STs
of bovine isolates in this study was combined with those

Page 7 of 9

of ST types of 18 bovine, 33 poultry meat as well as 97
patient isolates from domestically acquired infections
collected at the Helsinki University Central Hospital
Laboratory from the Helsinki-Uusimaa area in 2003
described in our previous MLST study [25]. Linkage
clustering and the corresponding admixture model were
used [18-21]. The estimation algorithm was used with
10 replicate runs where the maximum number of clusters was set to values in the interval 2-10 and STs were
assigned to clusters with the highest posterior probability. Admixture inference was based on 100 Monte Carlo
runs and 100 Monte Carlo reference samples to estimate the p-values. Significant admixture was set at a
threshold level of P ≤ 0.05 to detect admixed STs. To
gain further insight into the BAPS derived clusters, we
did a phylogenetic analysis of the STs using software
MEGA v 4.0.2 [45]. A neighbour-joining (NJ) tree based
on maximum composite likelihood for concatenated
allele sequence data was generated and the BAPS clusters were mapped on the tree. eBURST analysis [46] of
the 74 STs in our dataset was performed using default
options in eBURST version 3 available at http://eburst.
mlst.net[47].
Statistical analyses

Analyses of association of each BAPS cluster, and ST or
CC with the source of isolation were carried out using
the Chi-square or Fisher’s exact two-tailed test when
appropriate. Results were considered statistically significant at P ≤ 0.05.
