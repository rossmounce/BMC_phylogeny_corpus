Reconstructing genome trees of prokaryotes
using overlapping genes
Chih-Hsien Cheng1, Chung-Han Yang1, Hsien-Tai Chiu2, Chin Lung Lu1,2*

Abstract
Background: Overlapping genes (OGs) are defined as adjacent genes whose coding sequences overlap partially or
entirely. In fact, they are ubiquitous in microbial genomes and more conserved between species than nonoverlapping genes. Based on this property, we have previously implemented a web server, named OGtree, that
allows the user to reconstruct genome trees of some prokaryotes according to their pairwise OG distances. By
analogy to the analyses of gene content and gene order, the OG distance between two genomes we defined was
based on a measure of combining OG content (i.e., the normalized number of shared orthologous OG pairs) and
OG order (i.e., the normalized OG breakpoint distance) in their whole genomes. A shortcoming of using the
concept of breakpoints to define the OG distance is its inability to analyze the OG distance of multi-chromosomal
genomes. In addition, the amount of overlapping coding sequences between some distantly related prokaryotic
genomes may be limited so that it is hard to find enough OGs to properly evaluate their pairwise OG distances.
Results: In this study, we therefore define a new OG order distance that is based on more biologically accurate
rearrangements (e.g., reversals, transpositions and translocations) rather than breakpoints and that is applicable to
both uni-chromosomal and multi-chromosomal genomes. In addition, we expand the term “gene” to include both
its coding sequence and regulatory regions so that two adjacent genes whose coding sequences or regulatory
regions overlap with each other are considered as a pair of overlapping genes. This is because overlapping of
regulatory regions of distinct genes suggests that the regulation of expression for these genes should be more or
less interrelated. Based on these modifications, we have reimplemented our OGtree as a new web server, named
OGtree2, and have also evaluated its accuracy of genome tree reconstruction on a testing dataset consisting of 21
Proteobacteria genomes. Our experimental results have finally shown that our current OGtree2 indeed outperforms
its previous version OGtree, as well as another similar server, called BPhyOG, significantly in the quality of genome
tree reconstruction, because the phylogenetic tree obtained by OGtree2 is greatly congruent with the reference
tree that coincides with the taxonomy accepted by biologists for these Proteobacteria.
Conclusions: In this study, we have introduced a new web server OGtree2 at http://bioalgorithm.life.nctu.edu.tw/
OGtree2.0/ that can serve as a useful tool for reconstructing more precise and robust genome trees of prokaryotes
according to their overlapping genes.

Background
The approach to analyzing a single gene (e.g., ribosomal
RNA) has proved itself to be a powerful tool in molecular phylogenetic studies. However, it may not be suitable
for deriving the phylogenetic history of organisms
because it sometimes provides insufficient resolution in
the derived tree due to limited phylogenetic information
in a single gene, or it gives rise to conflicting trees when

applied to different individual genes due to different
evolution rates or horizontal gene transfer [1]. The
recently advent of high-throughput sequencing techniques has made it possible and reliable for evolutionary
biologists to reconstruct phylogenetic trees of organisms
(hereafter called genome trees) using the overwhelming
amount of genomic information extracted from their
complete genomes. It is also believed that the created
genome trees are less affected by variable mutation rates
or horizontal gene transfer events. So far, many different
methods on the basis of this principle have been

proposed [2], such as gene content based on the presence and absence of genes [3,4] and gene order based
on the presence and absence of gene pairs [5-7]. Gene
order basically evolves faster than gene content [2]. To
gain a high-resolution genome tree, therefore, gene
order is more suited for closely related organisms,
whereas gene content is more suited for distantly related
organisms.
Recently, Luo et al. [8,9] have proposed a new
method, as well as a server named BPhyOG, for reconstructing the genome trees of some prokaryotes only
based on the content of overlapping genes. The socalled overlapping genes (OGs) are defined as adjacent
genes whose coding sequences (CDSs) overlap partially
or entirely. In their studies [8,9], Luo et al. have
reported that OGs can serve as a useful phylogenetic
character by providing interesting additional insights
into phylogenetic relationship among prokaryotes. Their
rationale for doing this is as follows. As phylogenetic
characters, OGs may not evolve as slowly as gene content, because they can be observed frequently in all prokaryotic genomes and may also mutate at a universal
(constant) rate [10,11]. On the other hand, OGs have
more evolutionary conservation than gene order because
the linkage may be preserved between two functionalrelated OGs [12-14]. However, we have found that some
prokaryotic genome trees constructed using BPhyOG
are not greatly consistent with those produced by traditional phylogenetic approaches based on ribosomal
RNAs and/or concatenation of multiple protein
sequences [15].
To address this problem, we have recently implemented a new server, called OGtree [15], which allows evolutionary biologists to reconstruct more reliable genome
trees of some prokaryotes by using not only their OG
content but also their OG order. It has been widely
accepted that during evolutionary course, species genomes are subject to rearrangements, such as reversals
(also called inversions), transpositions and translocations, all of which can alter the order and/or the orientation of genes in the genomes. As a consequence, the
orders of orthologous OG pairs even between two closely related organisms may not be conserved. This suggests that we should take into account both OG content
and orthologous OG order when reconstructing the
genome trees of prokaryotes using the information of
OGs. In our previous study [15], therefore, we have
defined an overlapping-gene distance between two genomes based on a measure of combining OG content
(i.e., the presence and absence of OGs) and OG order
(i.e., the presence and absence of orthologous OG pairs)
in their whole genomes and also implemented our
OGtree according to the pairwise OG distances between
prokaryotic genomes. Our experimental results for a set

Page 2 of 11

of closely related Proteobacteria showed that our
OGtree outperformed BPhyOG in the quality of reconstruction of their genome trees.
In this study, we further improve the accuracy of our
OGtree by extending the genes retrieved from their
complete genomes to include their regulatory regions
and redefining the distance measure between two orthologous OG orders using genome rearrangements rather
than breakpoints caused by the absence of orthologous
OG pairs. The reasons for doing so are as follows. For
some distantly related prokaryotic genomes, the amount
of their overlapping CDSs is limited so that it is hard to
find enough OG pairs to properly evaluate their pairwise
OG distances and accurately reconstruct their genome
trees. Actually, the term “gene” defined in modern genomics should include not only its coding region, but also
its regulatory regions, such as promoter (at the 5’
upstream end of the coding region) and terminator (at
the 3’ downstream end of the coding region) [16]. In
addition, overlapping of regulatory regions of distinct
genes should be of certain interest, because the regulation of expression for these genes is more or less interrelated [17]. In this study, therefore, we expand the
region of a gene to include both its CDS and regulatory
regions so that two adjacent genes whose CDSs or regulatory regions overlap with each other are considered as
a pair of overlapping genes.
On the other hand, the orders of orthologous OG pairs
between two prokaryotic genomes, as mentioned above,
are often different due to genome rearrangements. The
distance measure between two orthologous OG orders we
previously defined was analogous to the breakpoint distance between two gene orders, which has been widely
used as a rough measure of genomic distance [5]. In contrast to the genome rearrangement distance, however, the
breakpoint distance may not correspond to an optimal series of events that accounts for the rearrangements of one
genome with respect to another. Moreover, it is still not
clear how to adapt the breakpoint analysis to multi-chromosomal genomes [18]. In this study, therefore, we try to
use the genome rearrangement distance involved with
reversals, block-interchanges (i.e., generalized transpositions) and translocations [19,20] to re-definethe distance
of the orthologous OG orders between two prokaryotic
genomes.

Results and Discussion
To demonstrate the accuracy improvement achieved by
our new OGtree2, we have selected 21 genomes of Proteobacteria, which consist of one a-Proteobacteria, three
b-Proteobacteria and 17 g-Proteobacteria, as the testing
dataset (Table 1). This dataset was previously used by
Comas et al. [21] for their phylogenomic study on the
monophyletic origin of insect endosymbionts from the

g-Proteobacteria, a debated issue with several conflicting
reports. In addition, we used the phylogenetic tree constructed by Comas et al. [21] based on concatenated
sequences of 60 homologous proteins as a reference tree
(Figure 1) and compared the genome tree obtained by
our OGtree2 (Figure 2) to those phylogenetic trees predicted by BPhyOG (Figure 3) [8] and our previous
OGtree (Figure 4) [15]. As was argued in [21], the phylogenetic tree in Figure 1 can be considered as a good
reference tree because it coincides with the taxonomy
accepted by biologists for these Proteobacteria. In particular, the three Buchnera species in this reference tree
form a monophyletic group with the other insect endosymbionts of B. floridanus and W. glossinidia. In addition, this group of endosymbionts is a sister clade to the
cluster of the other five enterobacteria of Yersinia,
Esherichia and Salmonella. However, it is worth mentioning here that the phylogenetic tree created by using
16S rRNAs, as shown in Figure 5, is different from that
in Figure 1. In this 16S rRNA tree, the g-Proteobacteria
of X. axonopodis, X. campestris and X. fastidiosa were
placed in the b-Proteobacteria branch and the species of
V. cholerae was placed away from P. aeruginosa. This
evidences that the single-gene approach to analyzing the
16S rRNAs is not suitable for inferring the phylogenetic
relationships between these Proteobacterial organisms.
In our experiment, the topologies of both the neighbor-joining (NJ) and Fitch-Margoliash (FM) trees (see

Figures 6 and 7, respectively) we obtained using
OGtree2 were different from the one in the unweighted
pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) tree
(see Figure 2) with respect to the positions of R. prowazekii, V. cholerae, H. influenzae and P. multocida. Particularly, the a-Proteobacterium R. prowazekii was placed
in the branch of g-Proteobacteria in both the NJ and
FM trees. The two Pasteurellaceae species (i.e, H. influenzae and P. multocida) and V. cholerae were neighbors
in the NJ tree, while in the FM tree they formed a
monophyletic group that was placed in the enterobacterial branch. As to the UPGMA tree, its topology was
greatly congruent with that of the reference tree as
shown in Figure 1. In particular, the UPGMA tree
clearly and correctly divided the 21 Proteobacteria into
three monophyletic clades and it also reflected monophyly not only for the three Buchnera species but also
for a wider group including the other insect endosymbionts of B. floridanus and W. glossinidia with higher
support values. However, V. cholerae in the UPGMA
tree was placed a little away from P. aeruginosa, which
is the same as the phylogenetic tree of 16S rRNAs in
Figure 5. As done in our previous study on OGtree [15],
as well as the studies by Luo et al. on BPhyOG [8,9],
the UPGMA method in this experiment produced a
genome tree that is much more congruent with the
reference tree constructed using a trimmed alignment of
60 concatenated protein sequences, when compared to

both the NJ and FM methods. This characteristic may
be due to that, as originally reported in [10,11], evolution of OGs occurs at a constant mutation rate across
bacterial genomes, suggesting that the UPGMA method
is more suitable than both the NJ and FM methods for
the reconstruction of prokaryotic phylogenies on basis
of OG pairs.
As compared to the phylogenetic tree constructed by
BPhyOG (Figure 3), our OGtree2 produced a more
accurate phylogeny (Figure 2) for the 21 Proteobacteria
genomes used in this study. In the BPhyOG tree, the
relationship of endosymbionts was paraphyletic, because
the three Buchnera species failed to form a monophyletic group and the two insect endosymbionts, W. brevipalpis and B. aphidicola, were separated far away from
each other. In addition, the three b-Proteobacteria were
placed just as neighbor taxa rather than a sister cluster.
In contrast, W. brevipalpis, B. aphidicola and other
three Buchnera species in our UPGMA tree (Figure 2),
as well as in the reference tree (Figure 1), were placed
as a sister group, suggesting that there should be a common origin for these five endosymbionts. Moreover, our
current OGtree2 indeed outperformed over its previous
version OGtree in phylogeny reconstruction for

prokaryotes, because in the genome tree predicted by
OGtree using the UPGMA method (Figure 4), the
a-Proteobacteria of R. prowazekii and the b-Proteobacteria
of R. solanacearum were placed together as a sister
group and the insect endosymbiont of B. floridanus
was placed in the branch of enterobacteria.
As demonstrated above, as well as in other previous
studies [8,9,15], OG pairs indeed can serve as a useful
tool in phylogenetic inference of prokaryotes, because
they are abundant and more conserved than non-overlapping genes in prokaryotic genomes and even may
evolve at a constant rate across prokaryotic genomes. In
fact, our algorithm for constructing the genome trees of
prokaryotes using OG pairs relies on successfully identifying orthologous genes, as well as authentic ORFs and
horizontally transferred genes, before we can compare
the OG content and order across organisms and calculate their pairwise OG distances. Therefore, more accurate identification of authentic ORFs, HGT events and
orthologous genes will definitely further improve the
accuracy of our algorithm and software tool. On the
other hand, we measured the OG distance by taking
into account of both the OG content and order in a pair
of organisms. Particularly, we estimated the OG order

distance (i.e., ri,j) by using the genome rearrangements
involved with reversals (or inversions), block-interchanges (i.e., generalized transpositions) and translocations (including fusions and fissions) [19,20]. Although
this rearrangement distance may underestimate the true
distance, we believe that the difference between them for
the Proteobacteria we used in this study is small. The
reasons for this small difference are as follows. First, the
rearrangements we considered include not only reversals
but also transpositions and translocations. Second, Bourque and Pevzner [18] have conducted simulations to
compare the estimated reversal distances and the true
ones, consequently showing that the reversal distance
approximates the true distance very well as long as the
number of reversals remains below 0.4 n (i.e., the normalized reversal distance is less than or equal to 0.4),
where n is the number of genes being considered.
According to the experimental results we obtained in this
study, the normalized rearrangement distance (i.e., ri,j/n)
typically varies from 0 to 0.12 for closely related prokaryotes (e.g., free-living Enterobacteriaceae, while it is typically in the range of 0.43 to 0.5 for more divergent

organisms (e.g., between Pasteurellaceae and free-living
Enterobacteriaceae).

Conclusions
Previously, we have implemented a web server named
OGtree to demonstrate that overlapping genes can be
served as a useful genomic marker for reconstructing
genome trees of some prokaryotes. In contrast to
BPhyOG, the OG distance we defined to measure the difference between two prokaryotic genomes in our OGtree
was based on a combination of their OG content and
orthologous OG order. In this study, we have further
improved the accuracy of our OGtree in reconstruction
of prokaryotic genome trees by extending the regions of
genes to include their regulatory regions and redefining
the distance measure between two orthologous OG
orders using genome rearrangements rather than simple
breakpoints. Our experimental results on a set of 21 Proteobacteria have also shown that the above modifications
indeed helped us to reconstruct a more precise and
robust genome tree that coincides with the taxonomy
accepted by biologists for these Proteobacteria. This

suggests that our current OGtree2 can provide interesting insights into the study of evolutionary relationships
of completely sequenced prokaryotic genomes.

Methods
Algorithm of OGtree2

Basically, OG pairs are classified into three directional
patterns, namely, unidirectional (®®), convergent
(®¬), and divergent (¬®). It was reported that in prokaryotic genomes unidirectional OGs are most abundant, convergent OGs are less common, and divergent
OGs are rare [10,11,22]. We define the so-called orthologous OG pairs from two different genomes Gi and Gj as
pairs of genes that overlap in Gi and have orthologous
counterparts with the same directional pattern that also
overlap in Gj. Suppose that there are totally n orthologous OG pairs between G i and G j . Then we define
the overlapping-gene distance Di,j between Gi and Gj as
follows.

In the above formula, ri,j denotes the genome rearrangement distance between G i and G j using reversals,
block-interchanges (i.e., generalized transpositions) and
translocations (including fusions and fissions), which
can be computed in polynomial time when block-interchanges are weighted 2 and the others are weighted 1
[19,20], and xi and xj denote the numbers of total OGs
in G i and G j , respectively. Basically, D i,j evaluates the
distance between Gi and Gj by considering the orthologous OG order measure as defined in the first term and
the OG content measure as defined in the second term.
Then w o and w c can be considered as the weight of
orthologous OG order and the weight of OG content,
respectively, where their defaults are now set to 1 and 2,
respectively, in our OGtree2.
In theory, it can be proved that the value of ri,j is less
than or equal to n [20]. Below, we give an intuitive reason for this property. Basically, the number of breakpoints between two permutation orders over the same
set of n OG pairs is less than or equal to n. In the generic case, an optimal reversal or translocation will
remove two breakpoints, while an optimal block-interchange will remove four breakpoints. We therefore have
r i,j ≤ n, even though reversals and translocations are
weighted 1 and block-interchanges are weighted 2. It is
also worth mentioning, according to the experimental
results we obtained in this study, that for closely related
prokaryotes (e.g., free-living Enterobacteriaceae), ri,j is
typically between 0 and 120, while for more divergent

organisms (e.g., between Pasteurellaceae and free-living
Enterobacteriaceae), ri,j is typically in the range of 170
to 217, and typical values for n range between 13 and
2,700 depending on how closely related the species are.
In the following, we describe the details about the
procedures, as shown in Figure 8, we used to develop
our new web server, named OGtree2, for reconstructing
genome trees of prokaryotes using their OG pairs. First,
we download complete genomes from the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) using the
accession numbers specified by the user. The putative
genes are then extracted from each of these downloaded
genomes based on the annotation of coding sequences
(CDSs). Inevitably, some of these putative genes may
not be annotated correctly and, therefore, we allow the
user to further exclude those annotated as unknown,
hypothetical or putative genes for a more reliable analysis. In addition, we offer an option in our OGtree2 to
remove those annotated as horizontally transferred
genes at the HGT-DB database [23], because they are
very common in prokaryotic genomes and may obscure
the OG pairs with which we hope to reconstruct the
genome tree of prokaryotes.

Next, the BLASTP program [24] is used to determine
putative orthologous genes between two genomes
according to the so-called bidirectional best hit (BBH)
approach. A BBH denotes a pair of genes a and b from
two genomes Gi and Gj such that b is the best hit (i.e.,
most similar gene) when a is compared against all genes
of Gj, and vice versa. Tatusov et al. [25] have previously
evidenced that the BBH approach works reasonably well
for identifying putative orthologs of bacterial genomes.
The Inparanoid program [26] is also used as an alternative to identify putative orthologous genes between any
two genomes, because it has been shown to be the best
among five currently existing methods of automatically
detecting orthologous genes [27]. Recall that the term
“gene” defined in this study can be expanded to include
not only its coding region but also regulatory regions,
such as promoters and transcription terminators. Basically, the promoters of prokaryotes are always located
immediately upstream of the transcription start site
(TSS), the TSSs are located upstream of the start codon,
and the transcription terminators are located downstream of the stop codon. In this case, the CDSs of
genes are further extended at their 5’ and 3’ ends to

their regulatory promoter and terminator regions. Then
two adjacent genes in each genome are identified as
overlapping genes (OGs), or an OG pair, if their CDSs
(or extended CDSs) overlap partially or completely. Two
OGs, say (a, c) and (b, d), from different genomes are
then considered as an orthologous OG pair if a and b,
as well as c and d, are orthologous to each other, and
(a, c) and (b, d) have the same directional pattern.
Finally, we calculate the pairwise OG distance D i,j
between any two given genomes Gi and Gj according to
their OG pairs and then construct genome trees of all
input genomes using the so-called distance-based methods of building trees, such as unweighted pair group
method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA), neighbor-joining (NJ) and Fitch-Margoliash (FM).
Based on the algorithm described above, we have
implemented a web server named as OGtree2 (http://
bioalgorithm.life.nctu.edu.tw/OGtree2.0/) that allows the
user to reconstruct prokaryotic genome trees with overlapping genes retrieved from the prokaryotic genomes.
Orthologous OG Pair Identification and Genome Tree
Reconstruction

It is inevitable that some genes may be misannotated in
the genomes downloaded from the NCBI. We may
therefore remove those CDSs annotated as unknown,

hypothetical or putative genes from each downloaded
genome in our analysis. As was done in [15], however,
the fact that most of the CDSs in W. brevipalpisa are
currently annotated as unknown, hypothetical or putative leads us to find no orthologous OG pair between
W. brevipalpisa and other Proteobacteria, if all these
CDSs in W. brevipalpisa are excluded from our analysis
in this study. Instead, we first removed those horizontally transferred genes currently annotated at the HGTDB database [23] and then used the BBH approach, as
mentioned previously, to identify putative orthologous
genes by setting the parameters with a minimum Evalue of 10 -8 , at least 85% of each authentic CDS
sequence involved in the alignment, and a minimum
similarity of 45%. In addition, we observed that the
amount of the orthologous OG pairs between non-gProteobacteria genomes and other Proteobacteria genomes is few, resulting in difficulty in measuring the
accurate OG distances between them. Recall that the
term “gene” can be expanded to include both of its coding and regulatory regions, such as promoters and transcription terminators. In prokaryotic genomes, a
promoter region, which basically contains the so-called
-10 hexamer, extended -10 element, -35 hexamer and
UP element, usually occupies about 60 base pairs (bp)
upstream of the transcription start site (TSS) [28,29]

Cheng et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11:102
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/102

and a terminator region usually occupies about 50 bp
downstream of the stop codon [30]. Moreover, as exemplified in E. coli genome, 95% of TSSs occur 325 bp
upstream from the translation start sites (TLS) of their
corresponding genes [31]. According to these information, therefore, we extended the region of each CDS by
385 bp at its 5’ end and by 50 bp at its 3’ end, so that
any two adjacent genes in a genome were considered as
an OG pair if their extended CDSs partially or completely overlap with each other. With default values for all
the other parameters (i.e., wc = 2 and wo = 1), we used
OGtree2 to calculate the OG distance between every
pair of Proteobacteria and finally construct the genome
trees for all the Proteobacteria used in this study with
the UPGMA, NJ and FM methods.
In prokaryotic genomes, many genes are organized
into operon structures [32,33], where an operon is a
cluster of genes co-transcribed in a single mRNA. Most
operons typically have a single promoter located
upstream of the first gene of operon and a single terminator located downstream of the last gene of operon. By
the gene definition we used in this study, any two adjacent genes in such operons can be considered an OG
pair because they have the same regulatory elements. In
this situation, our method described above to identify
OG pairs can still find most of them because it has been
reported that, in most bacterial genomes, intergenic distances between genes in the same operon are often
small (e.g., less than 20 bp) [10,32].
Consensus Tree Reconstruction

To demonstrate the robustness of our method, we have
adopted a method similar to the so-called jackknife
resampling approach [34] to compute the support values
of the tree branches as described as follows. We first
randomly removed e -1 ≈ 37% of the initial OG pairs
from each genome, while retaining the relative orders of
the remaining OG pairs, and then calculated the OG
distance between every pair of Proteobacteria. In this
process, we implemented 1,000 such jackknife random
samples to obtain 1,000 pairwise OG distance matrices.
Next, we applied the NEIGHBOR/FITCH program in
the PHYLIP package [35] to these 1,000 OG distance
matrices to obtain 1,000 jackknife trees. Finally, we
applied the CONSENSE program in the PHYLIP package to these 1,000 jackknife trees to obtain a majorityrule consensus tree with the numbers at each node
representing the percentage of times that the clade
defined by that node appears in the 1,000 jackknife
trees.
16S rRNA Tree Reconstruction

We used the following procedure to obtain a 16S rRNA
tree topology for the 21 Proteobacteria. First, the 16S

rRNA sequences of these 21 Proteobacteria were downloaded from RDP (http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/)[36]. Their
multiple sequence alignment were then obtained using
CLUSTALW 1.8 [37]. Finally, the neighbor-joining tree
was inferred using the NEIGHBOR program of PHYLIP
3.6 [35] and its support values were obtained by bootstrap resampling with 1,000 replicates.
