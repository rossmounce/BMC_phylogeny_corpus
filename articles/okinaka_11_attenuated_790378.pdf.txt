Abstract
Background: An isolate originally labeled Bacillus megaterium CDC 684 was found to contain both pXO1 and
pXO2, was non-hemolytic, sensitive to gamma-phage, and produced both the protective antigen and the poly-Dglutamic acid capsule. These phenotypes prompted Ezzell et al., (J. Clin. Microbiol. 28:223) to reclassify this isolate
to Bacillus anthracis in 1990.
Results: We demonstrate that despite these B. anthracis features, the isolate is severely attenuated in a guinea pig
model. This prompted whole genome sequencing and closure. The comparative analysis of CDC 684 to other
sequenced B. anthracis isolates and further analysis reveals: a) CDC 684 is a close relative of a virulent strain, Vollum
A0488; b) CDC 684 defines a new B. anthracis lineage (at least 51 SNPs) that includes 15 other isolates; c) the
genome of CDC 684 contains a large chromosomal inversion that spans 3.3 Mbp; d) this inversion has caused a
displacement of the usual spatial orientation of the origin of replication (ori) to the termination of replication (ter)
from 180° in wild-type B. anthracis to 120° in CDC 684 and e) this isolate also has altered growth kinetics in liquid
media.
Conclusions: We propose two alternative hypotheses explaining the attenuated phenotype of this isolate.
Hypothesis 1 suggests that the skewed ori/ter relationship in CDC 684 has altered its DNA replication and/or
transcriptome processes resulting in altered growth kinetics and virulence capacity. Hypothesis 2 suggests that one
or more of the single nucleotide polymorphisms in CDC 684 has altered the expression of a regulatory element or
other genes necessary for virulence.

Background
Attenuated strains of Bacillus anthracis have played a
major role in the development of vaccines and our
understanding of anthrax. Early work by Pasteur and
Greenfield [1,2] capitalized upon strains missing one of
the mega-plasmids (pXO1), which resulted in attenuation. This enabled the development of the first bacterial
disease to be prevented through the use of an attenuated
live vaccine. This early work was improved by Sterne [3]
through the development of an attenuated strain missing
the second mega-plasmid (pXO2), but retaining the

toxin producing genes on pXO1 as antigens for immune
response. In recent years, avirulent strains have been
subjected to extensive DNA sequencing to understand
these plasmids, their virulence genes and to generate
hypotheses for attenuation mechanisms [4-11]. Conversely B. cereus strains that have acquired the known B.
anthracis mega-plasmids and anthrax-like virulence
properties remain an enigma and are also worthy of
further study to understand how this pathogen interacts
with its host [12-14].
An isolate from the Centers for Disease Control
(CDC) originally identified as B. megaterium, CDC 684/
NRRL-349S/NRS 234 (herein called CDC 684), was
being used as an avirulent outgroup control in experiments with B. anthracis [15]. However, this particular

isolate shares key phenotypic traits with B. anthracis
such as non-hemolytic on blood agar, production of
protective antigen and the poly-D-glutamic acid capsule,
and sensitivity to gamma bacteriophage. Because these
features are all hallmark phenotypes for B. anthracis,
Ezzell et al. [15] reclassified this isolate as B. anthracis
despite the observation that CDC 684 did not react with
monoclonal antibodies to a specific polysaccharide present in B. anthracis. Subsequent animal testing of this
isolate showed it to be severely attenuated in guinea
pigs, in contrast to wild-type B. anthracis (See results,
Attenuation of CDC 684). However, the underlying
mechanism behind this attenuated virulence phenotype
remained unknown. The advent of massively parallel
whole genome sequencing (WGS) provides an opportunity to examine the complete genetic component of
CDC 684 for clues that might bear on this problem.
This report provides a description of the WGS, assembly and annotation of the B. anthracis CDC 684 isolate.
We include analysis that: a) demonstrates that the genome of CDC 684 belongs to a specific B. anthracis
clade; b) identifies 51 single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNP) that are unique to the genome of this isolate; c)
describes the details of a large chromosomal inversion;
d) demonstrates that CDC 684 has altered growth
kinetics in culture and e) proposes two alternative and
testable hypotheses that could explain the attenuated
phenotype for CDC 684.

Phylogenetic placement of CDC 684

The discovery that CDC 684 was not a B. megaterium
strain but was rather B. anthracis, based on shared phenotypic features, prompted the use of the guinea pig
model to determine its virulence. In a pilot experiment,
groups of four guinea pigs injected i.m. with CDC 684
spores at doses of 114, 1,145, and 11,450 cfu/mL survived. These groups were then injected four days later
with 1.29 × 10 5 , 1.29 × 10 6 and 1.29 × 10 7 cfu/mL,
respectively, and again all survived. By comparison these
identical spore preparation and treatment conditions
produced LD50 values for the virulent Ames and Vollum-1B strains of 175 and 306 spores respectively in the
guinea pig model [16,17].
This lack of lethality indicated that CDC 684 is significantly attenuated. In a second experiment to confirm
attenuation, 10 guinea pigs injected i.m. with 1 × 10 8
cfu/mL CDC 684 spores all survived. These results confirm that CDC 684 is highly attenuated with an LD50 of
>1 × 108 spores in the guinea pig model.

The use of comparative WGS defined an extremely conserved and accurate phylogenetic SNP tree for B.
anthracis based on the analysis of 1,000 SNPs in 26
diverse isolates [18]. This analysis resulted in the
hypothesis that only a few selected SNPs at key positions along five branches were needed to accurately
place all B. anthracis isolates into one of 12 sub-clades.
This notion was shown to be accurate when 13 canSNPs
were subsequently used to accurately place more than
1,000 B. anthracis isolates into one of these 12 subclades [19]. In silico canSNP typing showed that CDC
684 falls along the lineage created by B. anthracis Vollum (A0488; [GenBank: ABJC00000000]). This
sequenced Vollum strain is presumed to be a close relative of the British isolate that was tested as a biological
weapon on Gruinard Island, Scotland, in the 1940s [20].
The close phylogenetic relationship between CDC 684
and Vollum demonstrates that CDC 684 belongs to a
highly virulent B. anthracis lineage. We were therefore
interested in further determining the degree of relatedness between Vollum and CDC 684, given the marked
differences in virulence between these two strains. An
initial comparative in silico analysis of Ames Ancestor
[GenBank: AE017334], CDC 684 and Vollum WGS
uncovered ~ 390 SNP differences distinct from Ames
Ancestor but common (i.e., derived) in both the CDC
684 and Vollum genomes. These results are consistent
with other whole genome SNP comparisons of 128 B.
anthracis isolates that suggest that the SNP genetic distance between Ames and Vollum is approximately 400
SNPs [Pearson, Schupp, Ravel and Keim, unpublished
data].
Preliminary analysis of 30 SNPs that phylogenetically
reside along a terminal position on the Vollum branch
indicated that there were at least 10 new nodes along
this branch, of which >100 Vollum-like isolates reside
[Chung, Pearson and Keim, unpublished data]. In silico
analysis of 10 new canSNPs along this branch indicated
that CDC 684 was not in the terminal node created by
the sequenced Vollum strain, but rather was located in
a node midway between the sequenced strain and a
branch point defined by the initial analysis of 100 Vollum-like strains, Figure 1.

Figure 1 Location of CDC 684 on the B. anthracis phylogenetic tree. Genotypic analysis of 30 SNPs in ~ 100 isolates from the original
Vollum node (Chung, Pearson and Keim, unpublished data) created 10 new collapsed branch points (nodes) along the Vollum sub-lineage
(black circles). The positions of 10 new canSNPs are designated by the ancestral to derived SNP type in the Ames Ancestor and A0488 (Vollum)
genomes respectively. The CDC 684 isolate creates a new branch (51 SNPs in length) midway along the Vollum branch and shares this node
with 15 isolates that were obtained from a collection from the CDC [22].

were 15 isolates that shared the Vollum branch node
with CDC 684. These isolates were predominantly recovered by the Centers for Disease Control during the 1950s
and 1960s. While the incidence of lethal anthrax infections in the United States had been greatly reduced during the 20 th century [21], it can be assumed that the
majority of the CDC isolates labeled as B. anthracis
would have come from sources containing virulent
strains such as imported hides and/or animal deaths [22].
Table 1 lists 27 non-synonymous chromosomal SNPs
from 51 total that are unique to CDC 684 in comparison to the Vollum (A0488) strain. There are no obvious
B. cereus or B. anthracis virulence factors on this list

but the role for each of these proteins in CDC 684 may
also be compromised by the large inversion event. It
also needs to be reiterated that while these SNPs are
unique in their relationship to the Vollum strain their
status in 15 other un-sequenced isolates who shared the
node along the Vollum branch are still undetermined. It
is likely that most of these SNPs will be shared (i.e., no
differences) with these 15 presumably virulent B.
anthracis isolates.
Sequence variations between the virulence plasmids

The simplest explanation for the attenuated phenotype for
CDC684 would be the mutation of one or more of the

virulence factors encoded on the pXO1 or pXO2 plasmids
that altered expression or function. These virulence factors
include the toxin gene complex on pXO1 (comprising
genes encoding for protective antigen, edema factor, and
lethal factor), the poly-D-glutamyl capsule gene complex
on pXO2 (encoded by capA, capB, capC and acpA), and
trans-acting transcription regulators on both plasmids
[23]. However, in silico comparison of the completed
sequences of the pXO1 and pXO2 plasmids from the
CDC 684 strain to those of the Ames Ancestor and Vollum strains showed that all of the known virulence factors
were intact. There was a single non-synonymous SNP
found in pXO1 GBAA_pXO1_0019, a large gene of
unknown function. Collectively we observed no putative
functional differences in the plasmid-encoded virulence
factors between CDC 684 and its closest relative, Vollum,
which is a fully virulent strain [24].

of the chromosome relative to the replication origin.
The dimensions of the inversion have been graphically
illustrated in a recent review of Bacillus anthracis genome variation [25]. This earlier report used Artemis
software http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/
artemis/ to illustrate the alignment and conserved gene
order of four finished and closed genomes (B. anthracis
Ames, B. anthracis Australia 94, B. anthracis CDC 684,
and B. thuringiensis Al Hakam). While the fine-scale
gene order in CDC 684 is precisely maintained as in the
Ames chromosome, the large rearrangement has caused
an inversion of a 3.3 Mbp region between the basepair
coordinates 454 Kbp and 3,783 Kbp in the Ames Ancestor chromosome (see Figure 2).
The inversion appears to have been caused by an internal recombination event between homologous regions
within two lysogenic lambda-like prophages (LambdaBa04
and LambdaBa02), which are found in all B. anthracis genomes [26,27]. The inversion can best be visualized at the
molecular level by examining the orientation of the att
(attachment) sites that flank the ends of these phages (Figure 2). Lysogenic bacteriophages possess cohesive ends
(att), usually 12-13 bp repeats, which serve as both excision points and “sticky ends” that enable the phage to cirularize as it enters a lytic life cycle [28]. At first glance it
seemed likely that the inversion may involve the att sites
in these Lambda like prophages and that the exchange
may have involved a site-specific recombination. But the
two att sites were unique to each other, i.e., Lambda Ba04
and Ba02 contain distinct att sites (Figure 2B) that allow
them to be distinguished from each other (Ba04, ATACAGCTCATGT and Ba02, TTTT(C/T)TTTACAC). In
Ames Ancestor, pairs of these two distinct att sites define
both the size (Ba04 = 37.3 kb; Ba02 = 44.0 kb) and boundaries of each prophage. In CDC 684 (Figure 2A), the external att sites (represented by black bars) are in relatively
identical chromosomal positions to those in the Ames
Ancestor. However, the internal att sites (represented by
green and red bars) have dramatically exchanged positions
between these genomes. In CDC 684, the right att site
(red bar) for LambdaBa04 has moved to the left att position of Lambda Ba02, and likewise the left att site for
Lambda Ba02 (green bar) has moved to the position occupied by right att site in Lambda Ba04. The net effect of
this exchange is the creation of new hybrid prophages in
CDC 684 (Figure 2B). These observations indicate that the
large inversion event did not involve site-directed recombination but rather a homologous recombination event in
the interior of both prophages.

Figure 2 The chromosomal inversion in CDC 684. Panel A: The att sites in two lambda-like prophages, Ba04 and Ba02. The att sites are
illustrated as vertical bars and their positions define the insertion site for each prophage. The black vertical bars indicate the position of the
external flanking edge of the att sites in each prophage. The black att sites are in the same relative positions in both the CDC 684 and Ames
Ancestor genomes. However, the red and green att sites (bars) highlight the positions in the prophages that are inverted in the CDC 684
genome. The red and green arrows indicate putative sites where a homologous exchange caused the 3.3 Mbp inversion. Panel B describes the
unique att sites and defines the size of each of the prophages. This panel also illustrates the translocation of the internal (red and green) att
sites in CDC 684 to equivalent positions within the sister prophages, which are 3.3 Mbp apart. The new att sites for both Lambda Ba04 and
Lambda Ba02 indicate that these two prophages in CDC 684 are now hybrid prophages containing unique 3’ elements.

presence of the inversion in other isolates. Because of its
size, the inversion is readily visible in the closed genome, but the molecular nature of the inversion is dependent on the proper alignment of two short regions (i.e.
165 bp) during the assembly of this genome. As illustrated in Figure 3, the 5’ end of each of the rep
sequences are distinct from each another and their positions are fixed at approximately the same positions in
both genomes. However, the 3’ end of the rep genes are

highly homologous, with scattered SNPs the only distinguishing feature between these paralogs.
Due to constraints on PCR amplicon size we used
mismatch amplification mutation assays (MAMA, [29])
to discriminate between the right and left ends of the
large inversion in CDC 684 and Ames Ancestor. The
rationale was to demonstrate the different ends of the
inverted 3.3 Mbp fragment in CDC 684 by use of real
time PCR assays. The MAMA system was designed to

nucleotides in black represent regions unique to the prophage rep genes and are in the same directionality in the CDC 684 and Ames Ancestor

recombination that resulted in the 3.3 Mbp inversion in CDC 684. Seven SNPs that define the prophage 3’ ends are in larger font, and are
labeled 1-7 or 7"-1” for Lambda Ba04 or Lambda Ba02, respectively. In CDC 684, the allele states for these prophages have switched
chromosomal positions relative to Ames Ancestor.

Lambda-like protein sequences relative to the Ames
Ancestor genome. Both the left and right assay systems
have common primers (CP, Table 2 and Methods) that
are fixed because they are external to the 3.3 Mbp inversion site. The internal primers are nearly identical but
they target mismatches at specific SNP sites; G on the
left site and A on the right site of the Ames genome.

These same internal primers (e.g., CP-Left-Inv-F and
Left-Inv-R, Table 2) cannot amplify the same 400 and
500 bp products in CDC 684 because they are separated
by 3.3 Mbp. But the reciprocal pairings of the internal
primers do amplify products from CDC 684.
These MAMA were used to analyze several isolates
within the Vollum branch. In addition, the SNPs flanking the inversion were compared to in silico analysis of
other B. anthracis WGS to determine the configuration
of this 3.3 Mbp region in other non-Vollum strains.
Table 3 illustrates that only the CDC 684 isolate possessed the inverted genotype from among 17 genomes
examined, indicating the inversion is not common in B.
anthracis.
Defining the dif site in B. anthracis

In E. coli the large ter region has been found to contain
a specific substrate sequence, dif (for Deletion Induced
Filamentation), which is used by two recombinases,
XerC and XerD, to resolve chromosomal multi-mers
and to allow daughter chromosomes to segregate before
cell division [30,31]. It has been proposed that the dif
site (a short palindromic sequence) is in fact a more
likely site of termination than any specific ter sites for
both the E. coli and B. subtilis chromosomes [32]. From
the perspective of the CDC 684 genome, the dif sites in
both g-proteobacteria and Firmicutes appear to have an
extremely close association with the maximum GC-skew
in those genomes that have been analyzed [32,33].
Dif sites have been defined in both B. subtilis [34] and a
member of B. cereus sub-group [32]. A cursory survey of
Table 3 Status of the Large Inversion Site by PCR or in
silico analysis of 18 B. anthracis genomes

the palindrome from the B. subtilis and B. cereus dif site
(AATATATATT) in the Ames Ancestor identified a 28bp palindromic sequence [32] that is located at nearly the
precise genomic site of the cumulative GC-skew. This
sequence is conserved and positioned at the cumulative
~ 180° GC-skew position of every complete whole genome sequence in all of the GenBank entries for the B.
cereus sub-group (Table 4). The one exception is the genome of CDC 684 where the conserved dif-like sequence
and the GC-skew are oriented at ~ 120° in relationship to
the origin of replication (Figure 4, Table 4).
Growth Kinetics of CDC 684 versus wild type B. anthracis

The significant difference in the spatial orientation of
the ori site and dif/GC skew sites in CDC 684 suggests
that there could be an alteration in how the bi-directional replication of chromosome would proceed
because of the unequal distances the opposite leading
strands would need to travel. Because accumulated evidence indicates that genomes like those of E. coli and
Bacillus sp do not tolerate significant changes between
the spatial orientation of the ori and ter sites, we
designed a growth experiment to compare the growth
kinetics of CDC 684 to those of three wild type B.
anthracis strains.
Growth curves for four strains of Bacillus anthracis:
Ames, Ba_A0361 (a B branch isolate), Vollum and CDC
684 were grown in LB broth at 37°C (Figure 5). These
cultures were grown in duplicate (Ames, BaA0361) or
triplicate (Vollum, CDC 684) with growth measured by
OD 600 . The strains represent two major phylogenetic
groups of B. anthracis. Note the relatively consistent
growth curves for the three wild type isolates: Ames, Ba

conditions necessary for growth and cell division. The
slower mid log growth rate (~55 min in Vollum and
~80 min in CDC684) in this experiment suggests that
even after revival from lag phase that CDC 684 has a
cellular limitation to growth that does not exist in the
wild type strains. These results provide a growth parameter that implies that the spatial change in the orientation of the origin of replication and the termination site
in CDC 684 may have altered the growth of this isolate.

Discussion
By phylogenetic, molecular and clinical criteria, CDC 684
is a B. anthracis and its attenuated phenotype must be
due to differences within its genome relative to those of
other closely related B. anthracis strains. The marked
degree of attenuation of CDC 684, (with an LD50 of >1 ×
108 spores by the i.m. route in the guinea pig) compares
with LD50 values of 175 and 306 spores reported for the
virulent Ames and Vollum-1B strains [16,17]. It therefore
renders a comparative genomics approach highly informative and suggests that either subtle SNP differences
and/or a dramatic and massive inversion within this
chromosome are responsible for the attenuation.

Whole genome sequencing and comparative analysis
indicates that there are 51 chromosomal and < 6 plasmid SNP that are unique to CDC 684 in a comparison
to Vollum. The possibility that one or more of these
rare SNPs may have an important role in the attenuation of CDC 684 remains a viable option. These data
have defined a new CDC 684 lineage emanating from
the original Vollum branch, Figure 1. Twenty-seven of
these SNPs would be translated into non-synonymous
mutations in putative gene functions. None of these
SNPs, however, are in genes considered to be virulence
factors found in opportunistic B. cereus pathogens that
include a variety of hemolysins, non-hemolytic enterotoxins, monomeric entertoxins and phospholipases [35].
The remaining 23 SNPs include 11 synonymous SNPs, 7
SNPs in pseudogenes, and 5 intra-genic SNPs. Only one
of these intra-genic SNPs is located in a region within a
promoter region (-7 bp) in a L-serine dehydratase gene
(GBAA_4361).
What has not been excluded from this new lineage are
15 B. anthracis isolates that currently share the nodal
position between the CDC 684 and Vollum lineages (see
Figure 1). A sequencing effort to identify CDC 684

Okinaka et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:477
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/477

specific SNP that are either shared or still unique among
the presumably virulent 15 isolates would point to phenotype altering SNP. Any chromosomal and plasmid
SNP that are still unique to CDC 684 would be candidates for having positions in genes or regulatory regions
with roles that govern known or unknown functions
that are necessary in a virulent organism. There is, as
yet, no clear notion whether or how any of these SNPs
could cause the dramatic change in the virulence or
growth properties of CDC 684.
The role of the chromosome of B. anthracis in the
overall etiology of the disease anthrax is still poorly
understood. It is becoming evident that the regulatory
functions of the virulent plasmids (pXO1 and pXO2)
work in concert with certain chromosomal regulatory
functions in a virulent organism, e.g. the regulation of
the pXO1 atxA gene by chromosomal sigma factors or
plasmid genes involved in a signal-transduction pathway
that inhibits sporulation [36]. These and other recent
studies [37] make it difficult to dismiss any of the CDC
684 non-synonymous mutations as candidates for a role
in the attenuated phenotype without further analysis.
An alternative hypothesis to explain the attenuation
of CDC 684 is a role for the large 3.3 Mbp inversion
within its chromosome. While this inversion does not
appear to have altered the fine-scale order of the individual genes, it has changed the orientation of the genes
within the inversion with respect to the genes outside of
the inversion. This change in the orientation has been
illustrated by whole genome alignments [25] and by an
analysis of the GC skewing and the location of dif sites
of the CDC 684 genome and that of several B. anthracis
and B. cereus sub-group isolates (Figure 4, Table 4).
These analyses indicate that the spatial relationship
between the origin of replication and the termination of
replication in CDC 684 has been perturbed by the massive inversion. The comparative growth data (Figure 5)
clearly supports the idea that chromosomal replication
may be altered in CDC 684 by exhibiting an extended
lag phase and a longer growth rate.
The longer DNA synthesis time needed to complete
chromosomal replication may be sufficient, alone, to
explain the slower cellular growth rate of CDC 684. In
the asymmetrical CDC 684 chromosome, the longer
leading strand distance is 3.783 Mbp vs. 2.615 Mbp for
Vollum and all characterized wild type B. anthracis
strains. This is a ~38% larger chromosomal distance to
replicate and, assuming everything else remains constant, this will take that much longer to complete the
entire chromosome. The mid log doubling time difference between the wild type strains (~80 min) and CDC
684 (~80 min) is ~45%. The similarity between the 38%
long replication distance and 45% longer growth rate is
striking. This observation suggests that the displaced ter

Page 10 of 13

region remains the site for replication termination and
that the asymetrical longer leading strand replication
distance in CDC 684 becomes limiting for growth in
vitro.
Historical accounts suggest that there are strong tendencies to conserve the basic relationship between the
position of the ori and ter sites in enteric bacteria [38].
Following the discovery of the dif sites and related specific recombinases, it was proposed that the topological
relationship between the ori and the ter/dif site must be
maintained at 0° and 180°, respectively, for normal chromosomal segregation to occur [31]. This was suggested
because mutations in the Xer recombinase genes or the
dif site or the displacement of the dif site to other
regions of the chromosome had adverse effects on cell
division.
More recently whole genome sequence comparisons
between several distinct species also suggest that there
is conservation in the spatial orientation between the ori
and ter sites over broad groups of bacteria [39-41]. Dot
plots of conserved DNA and protein sequences between
pairs of species produce characteristic X-shaped patterns
suggesting that large chromosomal rearrangements often
revolve around and maintain the distances between the
origin and the terminus.
This study illustrates a case where the naturally conserved 180° orientation of the ori and ter sites has been
modified by a large chromosomal inversion in a strain
of B. anthracis, CDC 684. We suggest that the consequence of the altered spatial relationship between the
ori and ter sites from 180° to 120° has caused the
change in growth kinetics of this isolate (Figure 5). We
also suggest that this change appears to alter the length
of time that CDC 684 takes to replicates its chromosome. Whether this change has also altered the virulent
phenotype of this isolate is yet to be determined.

Conclusions
We address two hypotheses that could have a role for
the attenuated phenotype in B. anthracis CDC 684. The
first is that a single chromosomal point mutation may
have altered a function that is crucial to normal growth
and virulence in B. anthracis.
Despite evidence for a wide array of chromosomal
rearrangements in the B. cereus subgroup [42], BLAST
searches conducted using the dif region of Bacillus
anthracis and B. cereus also indicate a trend towards
maintaining a nearly 180° spatial relationship between
the ori/dif sites (171°- to 178°, Table 4). The second
hypothesis, therefore, suggests that major alterations of
this relationship are possibly not tolerated by B. anthracis when under natural ecological pressures. The existence of an isolate like CDC 684 demonstrates that a
moderate skewing in the spatial relationship between

Okinaka et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:477
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/477

the ori /dif may be overcome in terms of sheer growth
and survivorship in the laboratory. But we suggest that
the potential biological consequences of altered DNA
replication and/or DNA expression rendered by this
change may have resulted in an altered phenotype for
successful pathogenicity in a mammalian host. Both
kinds of “genetic alterations” can be expected to be rare
in B. anthracis since these organisms would not have a
selective advantage in a natural environment and would
be difficult to find.

Methods
Whole genome sequencing and assembly

The genome of B. anthracis CDC 684: Chromosome
[GenBank: CP001215.1]. pXO1 [GenBank: CP001216]
and pXO2 [GenBank: CP001214] was sequenced at the
Joint Genome Institute (JGI)/J. Craig Venter Institute
using a combination of 3 kb and 8 kb DNA libraries.
All general aspects of library construction and sequencing performed at the JGI can be found at http://www.
jgi.doe.gov/. Draft assemblies were based on 59,691
total reads. The Phred/Phrap/Consed software package
http://www.phrap.com was used for sequence assembly
and quality assessment [43,44]. After the shotgun
stage, reads were assembled with parallel Phrap (High
Performance Software, LLC). Possible mis-assemblies
were corrected with Dupfinisher [45] or transposon
bombing of bridging clones (Epicentre Biotechnologies,
Madison, WI). Gaps between contigs were closed by
editing in Consed and by custom primer walking
(Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). A total of
1955 additional custom PCRs were necessary to close
gaps and to raise the quality of the finished sequence.
The completed genome sequence of B. anthracis str.
CDC 684 contains 62,606 reads, achieving an average
of 10-fold sequence coverage per base with an error
rate of < 10-6.
Experimental animals and spore challenges

Spores were prepared from B. anthracis CDC 684 as
previously described [16] and female Hartley guinea pigs
(660 g) were challenged intramuscularly (i.m.) with various spore concentrations (see ‘Results’) at USAMRIID
as previously described [16,46]. Research was conducted
in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act and other
federal statutes and regulations relating to experiments
involving animals and adheres to principles stated in the
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
(National Research Council. 1996. Guide for the care
and use of laboratory animals National Academy Press,
Washington, DC.). The facility where this research was
conducted is fully accredited by the Association for
Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal
Care International.

Canonical SNP (canSNP) Analysis

The thirteen canSNP alleles and the specific assays for
each have been described previously [19]. TaqMan™
Minor Groove Binding (MGB) allelic discrimination
assays were used to determine the precise canSNP
grouping for every isolate used in this study [19,47].
SYBR MAMA Assays

Additional SNP genotyping was conducted using the
Mismatch Amplification Mutation Assay [MAMA] [29],
which is based on allele-specific PCR kinetics [48],
enhanced by penultimate mismatch primer design
[29,49]. The MAMA approach was also used to distinguish the inverted 3.3 Mbp segment of CDC 684 from
all other B. anthracis strains. MAMA assays were
designed for both the 5’ (left) and 3’ (right) ends of the
inversion; i.e., two sets of primer products separated by
3.3 Mbp. The sequences flanking the 3.3 Mbp inverted
region were unique and common to both CDC 684 and
the Ames genomes and were defined as Common Primers (CP). But the internal primers targeted nearly
identical sequences and therefore used primers designed
around mismatches that could distinguish and generate
400 and 500 bp PCR products. The primers were as follows (5’ to 3’): Left-inv-R (TAAAGCATCCACATCTTTTAATGgC), Right-inv-F (TTTCTAAAGCATCAA
CATCTTTTAAAGgT), and CP-Left-inv-F (GCATGTGATTACTTGAAGGATAGAAGG) were used to characterize the left inversion, and Left-inv-R, Right-inv-F
and CP-Right-inv-R (5’- AGATTTCCAGTGAGAGATGATAACAACA) targeted the right inversion. Underlined nucleotides overlap the SNP; nucleotides in
lowercase represent deliberate penultimate mismatches.
The two consensus primers contained no SNPs or
incorporated mismatches. Expected inversion genotypes
using these primers are listed in Table 2 in the Results
section and an example of this assay system is illustrated
in Additional File 1.
The MAMA assay system was also used to type 10
new canSNP sites that further define the Vollum lineage
of B. anthracis. The primers for these sites are shown in
Additional File 2 as a Table.
Each inversion SYBR MAMA reaction comprised 1X
SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA), 0.1 uM MAMA primer, 0.2 uM consensus
primer, 0.08 U Platinum Taq polymerase (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) and molecular grade H2O to 9 uL. One
uL of genomic DNA was added to each well to a final
volume of 10 uL. Reactions were carried out in 384well optical plates (Applied Biosystems) on an ABI
Prism 7900 HT real-time instrument (Applied Biosystems) using the following thermocycling parameters: 2
min at 50°C, 10 min at 95°C, followed by 50 cycles of
15 s at 95°C and 1 min at 60°C. PCR products were

subject to post-amplification dissociation (15 sec at 95°
C, 15 sec at 60°C, 15 sec at 95°C) to confirm product
specificity.
Additional File 1 provides an example of real time
PCR profiles for the left inversion region using a fixed
Common Primer (CP) that is located outside of the left
boundary of the 3.3 Mbp inversion site in both CDC
684 and the Ames genomes. This figure demonstrates
real time PCR kinetics for the detection of amplicons
for the left boundary of the inversion site in both CDC
684 and the Ames Ancestor Genome using primer combinations described in Table 2.
GC Skew Analysis

A free software program, GenSkew http://genskew.
csb.univie.ac.at/, was used to compute the cumulative
skew for 15 complete WGS of B. anthracis, B. cereus
and B. thuringiensis. These WGS data were downloaded from GenBank: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
genbank/.
Growth Data

Stocks of B. anthracis Ames, B. anthracis Vollum
(A0488), B anthracis A0361 (a B branch isolate), and B.
anthracis CDC 684 were subcultured and grown for
~19 hours on LB agar. These cells were harvested and
normalized to OD600 densities that correspond to 10 5
cfu/mL based on viable count estimates from previous
experiments for each isolate. These measurements were
used to precisely add 105 cfu inoculums to create 3 ml
culture tubes for each isolate. These cultures were
grown at 37° C and OD600 measurements were determined on a CO800 Spectrophotometer.

Additional material
Additional file 1: Figure S1: MAMA real time PCR. Example of MAMA
Real Time PCR to Differentiate between a 3.3 Mbp inverted configuration
in CDC 684 and the wild type configuration in Bacillus anthracis. The
primers depicted in this figure were designed to detect the left
configuration for the wild-type and/or the inverted sequence for the
CDC 684 genome. The fixed common primer, CP Left-inv-F was paired
with both Right-inv-F and the Left inv-R primers. While the wild type
Ames Ancestor can be amplified by the two LEFT inversion primers (Left
inv F and Left inv R); the left inversion site in CDC 684 can only be
amplified by the CP left-inv-F and Right inv-F because the Right
inversion forward site normally situated 3.3 Mbp distal, has relocated to
within 450 bp of the CP left-inv-F primer. Note that these two panels
represent samples with the same three primers and that the positive
allele will amplify orders of magnitudes faster than the negative allele.
The delta CT (cross-over threshold) values are the differences between a
specific linear portion of the target sequence (in cycles) versus the
number of cycles to obtain the same (threshold) signal in the non-target
sequence (e.g....the delta CT for CDC 684 vs Ames is 13.4.
