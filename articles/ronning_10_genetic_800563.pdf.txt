Abstract
Background: Burkholderia species exhibit enormous phenotypic diversity, ranging from the nonpathogenic, soiland water-inhabiting Burkholderia thailandensis to the virulent, host-adapted mammalian pathogen B. mallei.
Genomic diversity is evident within Burkholderia species as well. Individual isolates of Burkholderia pseudomallei and
B. thailandensis, for example, carry a variety of strain-specific genomic islands (GIs), including putative pathogenicity
and metabolic islands, prophage-like islands, and prophages. These GIs may provide some strains with a
competitive advantage in the environment and/or in the host relative to other strains.
Results: Here we present the results of analysis of 37 prophages, putative prophages, and prophage-like elements
from six different Burkholderia species. Five of these were spontaneously induced to form bacteriophage particles
from B. pseudomallei and B. thailandensis strains and were isolated and fully sequenced; 24 were computationally
predicted in sequenced Burkholderia genomes; and eight are previously characterized prophages or prophage-like
elements. The results reveal numerous differences in both genome structure and gene content among elements
derived from different species as well as from strains within species, due in part to the incorporation of additional
DNA, or ‘morons’ into the prophage genomes. Implications for pathogenicity are also discussed. Lastly, RNAseq
analysis of gene expression showed that many of the genes in j1026b that appear to contribute to phage and
lysogen fitness were expressed independently of the phage structural and replication genes.
Conclusions: This study provides the first estimate of the relative contribution of prophages to the vast
phenotypic diversity found among the Burkholderiae.

Background
Burkholderia pseudomallei, causal agent of the potentially fatal disease melioidosis, is a metabolically versatile
soil organism that has been classified as a Category B
biological threat by the CDC [1,2]. Relatively little is
known about its pathogenesis, virulence factors, the
extent of diversity in natural populations, and host
response. B. pseudomallei genome plasticity has been
associated with genomic island variation. The genome of
B. pseudomallei K96243 (7.3 Mb), for example, features
16 genomic islands, at least three of which appear to be
prophages [3]. It is unclear whether all of these putative

prophages are active, although one (FK96243) was
shown to be a productive bacteriophage. B. pseudomallei
isolates are genetically quite diverse [4,5], and this heterogeneity may be due at least in part to the highly variable distribution of bacteriophages among strains [6].
Such differences may provide certain strains survival
advantages in the environment and the host, as well as
explain the variable clinical presentation of melioidosis.
Also raising concern as a potential biological weapon is
the very closely related B. mallei, causal agent of the primarily equine disease known as glanders [7]. In contrast
to B. pseudomallei, B. mallei is a highly specialized
pathogen, not found outside of a mammalian host in nature. B. mallei is a host-adapted clone of B. pseudomallei,
and all of the B. mallei genome is nearly identical to a set
of genes within B. pseudomallei core genome. However,

in addition to its core genome B. pseudomallei contains
numerous contiguous gene clusters that were deleted
from B. mallei during its evolution [8,9].
B. thailandensis is another closely related organism
often found in the same environmental samples (soil
and water of endemic melioidosis regions) as B. pseudomallei [10]. Unlike B. pseudomallei and B. mallei, B.
thailandensis has very low virulence in most animal
hosts, including humans. The ability to metabolize arabinose, and the corresponding loss of the arabinose
assimilation operon from B. pseudomallei, phenotypically distinguishes B. thailandensis from B. pseudomallei
[11]. The genes encoding arabinose assimilation may be
considered as antivirulent, and their absence from B.
pseudomallei (and B. mallei) may have allowed the
development of the latter as pathogens [12]. Burkholderia multivorans, a member of the Burkholderia cepacia complex, is an opportunistic pathogen associated
with infection in cystic fibrosis patients that is also
found in soil environments [13].
The presence of prophages among bacterial isolates
and their possible contribution to bacterial diversity is
widespread. By carrying various elements contributing
to virulence, prophages can contribute to the genetic
individuality of a bacterial strain. This phenomenon has
been reported in Salmonella spp [14] and Lactobacillus
spp [15,16], among others. Prophage-associated chromosomal rearrangements and deletions have been found to
be largely responsible for strain-specific differences in
Streptococcus pyogenes [17] and Xylella fastidiosa [18].
Thus, temperate phages carrying foreign DNA can play
a role in the emergence of pathogenic variants. Lateral
gene transfer between phage and host genomes, and
phage lysogenic conversion genes, can alter host phenotype through production of phage-encoded toxins and
disease-modifying factors that affect virulence of the
bacterial strain. Examples of such phage-encoded virulence factors abound in the literature, and include proteins associated with toxicity, antigenicity, invasion,
intracellular survival, serum resistance, and adhesion
[19]. Many of these factors are encoded by morons that
are present variably across phage genomes and are
thought to be regulated independently of the phage
genes [20].
To estimate the contribution of prophages to genetic
and phenotypic diversity of the species, we have isolated
and sequenced five temperate bacgteriophages from
Burkholderia, three from B. pseudomallei and two from
B. thailandensis, and used bioinformatics techniques to
search for putative prophage regions in the genomes of
nine sequenced B. pseudomallei strains, six B. mallei
strains, one B. thailandensis strain, three B. multivorans
strains, and one Burkholderia xenovorans strain. While
no prophages were detected in any of the B. mallei

Page 2 of 17

strains, a total of 24 putative prophages or prophage-like
islands (PI) were identified in the other species.
Sequences from the isolated phages and inferred prophages were compared with each other and with the 8
published phage sequences from B. pseudomallei, B.
thailandensis, B. cenocepacia, and B. cepacia. As seen in
other genera, the prophages among the Burkholderiae
contribute to the genomic variability of the species and
carry genes that could provide advantages in the environment and host adaptation.

Methods
Spontaneous bacteriophage production by lysogenic B.
pseudomallei and B. thailandensis strains, host range
studies, and UV induction experiments

Five bacteriophages were isolated and fully sequenced
(Table 1A).
Bacteriophage production and plaque formation by
B. pseudomallei and B. thailandensis strains were
assessed using B. mallei ATCC 23344 as an indicator
strain, as described previously [6,21].
B. pseudomallei strains Pasteur 52237, E12, and 644
and B. thailandensis strains E202 and E255 were grown
in LB broth for 18 h at 37°C with shaking (250 rpm).
Overnight cultures were briefly centrifuged to pellet the
cells, and the supernatants were filter-sterilized (0.45
mm). The samples were serially diluted in suspension
medium (SM) [22], and the number of plaque forming
units (pfu) was assessed using B. mallei ATCC 23344 as
the host strain. Briefly, one hundred microliters of filtersterilized culture supernatant was added to a saturated
B. mallei ATCC 23344 culture, incubated at 25°C for 20
min, and 4.8 ml of molten LB top agar (0.7%) containing
4% glycerol was added. The mixture was immediately
poured onto a LB plate containing 4% glycerol and incubated overnight at 25°C or 37°C. For jE202 host range
studies, this procedure was followed using the bacteria
listed in Additional file 1, Table S1. Bacteria were considered to be sensitive to jE202 if they formed plaques
under these conditions and resistant if they did not. No
bacterial species tested formed plaques in the absence of
jE202.
For jE202 UV induction studies, one hundred microliters of saturated B. thailandensis E202 culture was
used to inoculate two LB broth (3 ml) subcultures. One
set of subcultures was incubated for 5 h without interruption. The other set of subcultures was incubated for
3 h, poured into sterile petri dishes in a class II biological safety cabinet, subjected to a hand-held UV light
source (254 nm) for 20 sec (25 cm above the sample),
pipetted back into culture tubes, and incubated for an
additional 2 h. The titer of the filter-sterilized supernatants were determined by performing quantitative plaque assays on serially diluted samples.

Negative staining

To determine morphotypes, bacteriophages were prepared
from 20 ml of a plate culture lysate, incubated at 37°C for
15 min with Nuclease Mixture (Promega), precipitated
with Phage Precipitant (Promega), and resuspended in 1
ml of Phage Buffer (Promega). The bacteriophage solution
(~100 μl) was added to a strip of parafilm M (Sigma), and
a formvar-coated nickel grid (400 mesh) was floated on
the bacteriophage solution for 30 min at 25°C. Excess fluid
was removed, and the grid was placed on a drop of 1%
phosphotungstic acid, pH 6.6 (PTA) for 2 min at 25°C.
Excess fluid was removed, and the specimen was examined
on a Philips CM100 transmission electron microscope.
Nickel grids were glow discharged on the day of use.
Bacteriophage sequencing and annotation

Libraries were constructed from the genomic DNA from
the bacteriophage isolates. Since the phage genomes were
estimated to be 50 kb in size, sequencing, closure, and
annotation was performed similar to that of a BAC
sequence [23]. Each of the five isolated bacteriophages were
completely sequenced to 10× coverage, closed, and annotated, and the sequences deposited in GenBank (Table 1A).
Identification of putative prophages and prophage-like
elements within strains

Presence of prophage sequence within sequenced genomes of nine B. pseudomallei strains, six B. mallei strains
[8], three B. multivorans strains, B. thailandensis E264
[24], and B. xenovorans LB400 [25] (Additional file 1,
Table S2) was inferred using a number of similarity measures previously described [26,27]. First, the protein set
of each genome was searched against a non-redundant
database of viral proteins using BLASTP [28] with a cutoff of e-10. Secondly, the annotation of each strain was
searched for several virus-related keywords such as

integrase, tail, capsid, portal, terminase, etc. Clustering of
such proteins with proteins containing similarity to
known phage proteins as identified by BLASTP, as well
as the orientation of proteins within clusters was considered strong evidence for prophage presence. Finally,
tRNA genes and attachment sites were examined. A
tRNA sequence immediately flanking an integrase was
considered to be a potential att site, particularly if an
exact repeat of least a 10 bp of the tRNA was present
within several thousand bp. Regions containing all of
these factors (i.e., viral-like proteins clustered and in a
specific orientation, and flanked by a tRNA/integrase on
one end and an exact repeat of at least 10 bp of the
tRNA on the other end) were considered putative prophage. Regions containing many of these characteristics but
lacking one or more, usually an integrase or repeat
sequence, were considered prophage-like. Some att sites
are less than 10 bp and are difficult to spot so it is possible that some of the prophage-like elements may actually
be true prophages. Prophage and prophage-like regions
so inferred have been designated “PI-strain-1”, “PIstrain-2”, etc. (PI for Prophage Island), and are listed in
Table 1B. Four of the B. pseudomallei strains represent
two paired isolates from two separate patients, one strain
isolated from an initial infection and the paired isolate
from a re-emergent infection in the same patient.
Three of the 16 genomic islands previously identified
in B. pseudomallei K96243 were included in the analysis,
including jK96243 (GI2) and the putative prophages
GI3 and GI15 [3]. Three prophage-like islands identified
in B. thailandensis E264, GI1, GI12, and GI13, were also
included in the analysis (Table 1B) [24]. Additionally,
the published genome sequences of j1026b from B.
pseudomallei 1026b [6], jE125 from B. thailandensis
E125 [21], BcepMu from B. cenocepacia J2315 [29],
Bcep22 from B. cepacia, and Bcep781 from B. cepacia

included for comparison (Table 1C).

genes that had more than 10 hits were considered to be
expressed above the noise level.

Comparative genome sequence analysis and phylogenetic
tree construction

Results and Discussion

The program Dotter [31] was used to align nucleotide
sequences of all isolated and putative prophage and prophage-like sequences and to identify initial groupings. To
refine clusters, distance measures were calculated between
all pairs of each of the 30 prophage and PI sequences.
Reciprocal BLASTP comparisons of the translated protein
sets were performed for each prophage/PI against all
others. BLASTP distances between each pair were calculated according to the formula: 1-(number of significant
hits between both genomes/total number of genes in both
genomes) [32]. Distances were calculated using E value
cutoffs of 1 × E-01, 1 × E-05, and 1 × E-10. FITCH with the
global and jumble options was used to generate a phylogenetic tree from each of the three distance matrices derived
from the BLASTP distances [33].
Calculation of local collinear blocks (LCB or synteny
blocks) was done using progressive Mauve alignment
[34] with default settings. Initial identification of morons
was conducted in the Mauve alignments by searching
for ORFs that disrupted the collinearity in LCBs. Confirmation of morons was done by (i) comparing % GC
content of each ORF against the mean % GC of phagespecific genes (i.e., involved in structure, replication, and
host lysis); (ii) promoter and terminator prediction analysis with BPROM http://www.Softberry.com, PPP
http://bioinformatics.biol.rug.nl/websoftware, PROMSCAN [35] or Promoter Prediction by Neural Network
[36]; (iii) prediction of terminators with TransTermHP
[37]; and (iv) search for homologs across different phage
types within our data set and in the non-redundant
database at NCBI.

Five bacteriophages were isolated from three B. pseudomallei and two B. thailandensis strains (Table 1A) when
plaqued on B. mallei ATCC 23344 as a suitable host for
bacteriophages [3,6,21]. Most B. pseudomallei and B.
thailandensis strains only produced one phage, except
for E12 and 644 which each produced at least two different phage particles. All of the bacteriophages contained long tails. Three were classified as P2-like viruses,
one as a lambda-like virus, and one as a Mu-like virus.
The bacteriophage genomes ranged in size from 35.7 to
48.7 Kb and contained from 47 to 71 genes. Specific
details about each of these bacteriophages are provided
below, representative images of each isolated bacteriphage are shown in Fig. 1A and other properties are
described in Table 1A.

Phage gene expression analysis using RNAseq

RNA from three biological replicates of B. pseudomallei
DD503 (a derivative of 1026b) grown in LB was
extracted from cells in early logarithmic growth using
RNAeasy (QIAgen, Valencia CA). Ribosomal RNAs were
removed by 2 rounds of MicrobExpress (Ambion, Foster
City CA). Each RNA preparation was used in individual
cDNA synthesis reactions using SuperScript II (Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA) and sequenced individually in the
Illumina Genome Analyzer (Illumina Technologies, San
Diego CA) or SOLiD instruments with 100 or 50 bp
reads, respectively. Data was analyzed using CLC Genomics Workbench allowing for 2 mismatches in each
read and only one map location per read. Total gene
expression was normalized according to the total number of reads in the library and the gene size, resulting in
reads per kilobase per million reads (RPKM). Only

Isolated and sequenced bacteriophages

j52237

B. pseudomallei Pasteur 52237 spontaneously produced a
bacteriophage, designated j52237 that formed uniform,
slightly turbid plaques on B. mallei ATCC 23344, suggesting that this strain produces only one bacteriophage
under the growth conditions used. While it is plausible
that different bacteriophages might form plaques with
the same morphology, here we assumed that similar plaques were formed by only one bacteriophage. Based on
its morphotype, j52237 can be classified as a member of
the order Caudovirales and the family Myoviridae [38].
jE12-2

B. pseudomallei E12 spontaneously produced two bacteriophages, jE12-1 and jE12-2, that formed plaques
on B. mallei ATCC 23344. jE12-1 produced turbid plaques of 0.5 to 1 mm in diameter and jE12-2 produced
turbid plaques with a diameter of 1.5 to 2.0 mm. The
purified plaques maintained their morphology following
a further round of infection in the host suggesting that
they were formed by two distinct bacteriophages.
Approximately 10 pfu/ml of jE12-1 and jE12-2 were
present in B. pseudomallei E12 culture supernatants.
We were unable to isolate nucleic acid from jE12-1 and
no further work was carried out on this bacteriophage.
jE12-2 possessed an isometric head that was ~ 62 nm
in diameter and a contractile tail that was ~ 152 nm
long and ~ 21 nm in diameter (Fig. 1A). Similar to
j52237, jE12-2 can be classified as a member of the
order Caudovirales and the family Myoviridae [38].
j644-2

B. pseudomallei 644 spontaneously produced 2 bacteriophages, j644-1 and j644-2, that formed plaques on B.
mallei ATCC 23344. j644-1 and j644-2 produced plaques of different size and turbidity. j644-2 was ten

times more abundant in B. pseudomallei 644 culture
supernatants. Based on its morphology, j644-2 can be
classified as a member of the order Caudovirales and
the family Siphoviridae [38]. The genome of j644-1, a
member of the Myoviridae family, could not be determined in this study.
jE255

B. thailandensis E255 spontaneously produced a bacteriophage, designated jE255, which formed turbid plaques
with a diameter of ~ 0.5 mm on B. mallei ATCC 23344.
No other plaque types were identified. Based on its morphotype, jE255 can be classified as a member of the
order Caudovirales and the family Myoviridae [38].
jE202

B. thailandensis E202 spontaneously produced a bacteriophage, designated jE202, which formed turbid plaques
on B. mallei ATCC 23344. No other plaque types were
identified. jE202 production was increased 55-fold by
brief exposure to UV light (data not shown). Based on
its morphotype (Fig. 1A), jE202 can be classified as a
member of the order Caudovirales and the family Myoviridae [38]. We examined the host range of jE202
using 17 Burkholderia species (Additional file 1, Table
S1). Bacteriophage jE202 formed plaques on 9 of 10
natural B. mallei strains. It also formed plaques on a
capsule-deficient mutant derived from ATCC 23344,
DD3008 [39], suggesting that the capsular polysaccharide is not required for jE202 attachment. In contrast,
two B. mallei strains that do not produce lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were resistant to plaque formation by
jE202; NCTC 120 and DD110795 (a laboratory-passaged derivative of ATCC 15310), which suggests that
LPS is a receptor, or co-receptor, for jE202. Given the
>90% nucleotide identity of the tail assembly genes of
the Burkholderia Myoviridae, it is likely that they all
share the same receptor(s). Unlike other characterized
Burkholderia Myoviridae (jE125, j1026b), jE202 forms
plaques on a species other than B. mallei (Additional
file 1, Table S1), namely 3 strains of B. pseudomallei;
NCTC 4845, STW 199-2, and STW 115-2. It is currently unknown why these B. pseudomallei strains exhibit plaque formation with jE202 while others do not.
No other Burkholderia species examined formed plaques
with jE202 (Additional file 1, Table S1).
Genomic analysis of the Burkholderia phages
I. Myoviridae subgroup A and B

Based on sequence similarity, j52237, jE202, and
jK96243 belong to subgroup A of the Myoviridae and
jE12-2, GI15, and PI-E264-2 to subgroup B (Fig. 2).
Furthermore, the genomic structure of each of these are
arranged in multigene “modules” that encode proteins
involved in a common function, such as DNA packaging, head biosynthesis, tail biosynthesis, host lysis,

Page 7 of 17

lysogeny or DNA replication [40,41] (Fig. 1B). The relative order of these modules in j52237, jE202, and
jE12-2 is similar to that of bacteriophages P2 and
jK96243 [42]. The order is also conserved in bioinformatically-identified prophage-like elements GI15 of B.
pseudomallei K96243 and PI-E264-2 of B. thailandensis
E264 (see below).
The modules for tail assembly, lysis, and head assembly of all Myoviridiae phages were highly conserved (Fig.
1B). However, the region encoding for lysogeny and
DNA replication contained abundant genetic variability.
Some of the genes within this region were present
exclusively in either of the subgroups (Fig. 1B). This
suggests that the mechanism of integration, regulation
of excision, and/or replication of episomal bacteriophage
DNA could be distinct for subgroup A and B Myoviridae. For example, subgroup A bacteriophage genomes
encode DNA primase proteins which catalyze the synthesis of short RNA primers required for DNA replication
by DNA polymerases (Fig. 1 B). Subgroup B bacteriophages, on the other hand, encode for ParA-like partitioning proteins which are ATPases involved in
chromosome partitioning. In addition, subgroup B genomes encode replication gene A protein-like sequences.
Members of this family of proteins are endonucleases
which introduce single-strand nicks at or near the origin
of replication (Fig. 1B).
Among the conserved regions, some segments are
variably present in the bacteriophages and PIs (Fig. 1B).
It is likely that these regions were acquired by recombination with unrelated bacteriophages (or prophages),
and that these segments might be considered ‘morons’
[20]. This is supported by the fact that these regions
exhibit a lower % GC content relative to the rest of the
bacteriophage genomes (Fig. 1B), which suggests horizontal transfer of genetic information. Most of these
novel genes encode conserved hypothetical proteins
which have no defined functional activities, but share
similarity with proteins in other bacteriophages. No
obvious virulence factor genes are encoded by these bacteriophage genomes, which is consistent with a previous
report on this topic [42]. Interestingly, jE12-2 gp6 and
gp7 appear to encode a type II toxin-antitoxin (TA)
addiction module (Fig. 1B - see below) [43]. Other novel
proteins are encoded by the j52237, jE202, and jE12-2
genomes (Fig. 1B), but no functions can be assigned to
these gene products at this time.
The phage attachment sites (attP) of j52237 and
jE202 are found at the 3′ ends of putative site-specific
integrase genes (Fig. 1B) and are identical to each other.
The nucleotide sequence of attP contained a 45-bp
sequence that was identical to the 3′ end of the phenylalanine tRNA (GAA) gene on chromosome 1 of B. pseudomallei K96243 (positions 145,379-145,454). This attP

site is also utilized by jK96243 [3]. The integrase genes
of these three subgroup A Myoviridae terminate with
the tRNA (Phe) gene when integrated as prophages, but
not when the bacteriophage genomes are episomal.
Thus, following integration the integrase gene is partitioned into two fragments.
The jE12-2 attP site is located between gp24 and
gp25 (5′-AATTTGACATAAGGTAAA-3′) (Fig. 1B) and
is identical to the sequence at both ends of GI15 in B.
pseudomallei K96243 [3]. This integration site is present
in an intergenic region on the B. pseudomallei genome
and does not disrupt any obvious ORFs. This attP site

does not have any homology to tRNAs. PI-E264-2 is
also flanked by a similar sequence (5′-ATTTGACATAACGTAAA-3′) in B. thailandensis E264, suggesting
that it also uses this attP. No obvious integrase genes
are encoded by jE12-2, GI15, or PI-E264-2, which suggests these subgroup B Myoviridae use a different
mechanism of integration.
Mu-like phages

The jE255 genome shares ~ 90% nucleotide sequence
identity with the genome of BcepMu, a Mu-like bacteriophage spontaneously produced by Burkholderia cenocepacia strain J2315 [29]. Similar to BcepMu, the jE255

Ronning et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:202
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/202

genome can be divided into functional clusters from the
left end to the right end of the linear phage genome:
replication and regulation, host lysis, head assembly, and
tail assembly (Fig. 1D). jE255 encodes a transposase
with a Rve integrase domain (gp40, PFAM PF00665)
that allows transposition as a mechanism of replication.
Following replicative transposition, DNA is packaged
into the bacteriophage heads using a pac site at the left
end of the bacteriophage genome which allows 2002,000 bp of flanking host DNA to also be packaged [29].
The genomic sequence of jE255 (accession number
NC_009237) contains 467 bp of host DNA sequence
(Bm ATCC23344). The left and right ends of the linear
jE255 genome contain 23-bp imperfect direct repeats
that could be recognized by gp40 during replicative
transposition (Fig. 1D). These repeats are similar to
those found at the ends of the BcepMu genome [29]
and the nucleotide differences are underlined in Fig. 1D.
Three regions of the jE255 genome are not present in
the BcepMu genome and appear to be jE255-specific
(gray shading in Fig. 1D). The unique regions are found
at the left and right ends of the jE255 genome, which is
consistent with the location of unique sequences in
BcepMu and other BcepMu-like prophages [29]. The
two unique genes on the left side of the bacteriophage
genome, gene41 and gene46, encode a conserved
hypothetical protein and a lambda C1 repressor-like
transcriptional regulator, respectively (Fig. 1D). These
proteins are presumably involved in jE255 activation
and/or replication. Five unique genes are encoded on
the extreme right end of the jE255 genome, including
genes 26-30 (Fig. 1D). Gp26 encodes a putative tail fiber
protein which presumably is required for attachment
and probably provides host receptor specificity to this
bacteriophage. It is interesting that this gene, and the
downstream tail assembly chaperone protein (gp27), are
the only tail assembly genes that are not conserved in
BcepMu. This suggests that the BcepMu receptor(s) on
B. cenocepacia is distinct from the jE255 receptor(s) on
B. thailandensis and B. mallei. Furthermore, it suggests
that the unique tail fiber protein and a tail assembly
chaperone protein (gp27) were either acquired by jE255
via horizontal transfer or lost by BcepMu. Gp28 is a
hypothetical protein with no functional prediction, but
gp29 is a putative ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporter protein (Fig. 1D). It is possible that jE255 gp29 is
involved in the import of a nutrient or export of toxic
metabolites that confers a selective advantage on the
lysogen harboring it. On the other hand, Lactococcus
lactis bacteriophage P335 [44] and Streptococcus pyogenes bacteriophage jNIH1.1 [45] also encode ABC
transporters and these molecules may play an undefined
role in the bacteriophage lifecycle. Finally, gp30 is a
putative formyl transferase domain protein (Fig. 1D), a

Page 9 of 17

family of proteins involved in a variety of biochemical
pathways, including de novo purine biosynthesis,
methionyl-tRNA biosynthesis, and formate biosynthesis.
None of these jE255 genes have homologs in any of the
other phage/PI or Burkholderia genomes reported here
or elsewhere.
Siphoviridae

The gene order and modular organization of the j644-2
genome is reminiscent of lambdoid bacteriophages,
including j1026b and jE125 [6,21,46,47]. The j644-2
genome harbors five regions that are specific to j644-2
and contain a lower GC content than the rest of the
j644-2 genome, suggesting they may have been
acquired horizontally from a novel source (gray shading
in Fig. 1C). The thirteen novel genes present in these
regions encode hypothetical proteins with no known
function (gp22, gp23, gp24, gp33, gp34, gp35, gp46,
gp47, gp48, gp49, gp55, gp66, and gp67). The genome
also contains several interesting features, including a
putative phosphoadenosine phosphosulphate (PAPS)
reductase (gp56), a putative type II toxin-antitoxin module (gp69 and gp70), and a putative HNH endonuclease
(gp71) that might be advantageous to the phage or its
lysogen (Fig. 1C; discussed further below).
The j644-2 genome contains ten base 3′ singlestranded extensions on the left (3′-GCGGGCGAAG-5′)
and right (5′-CGCCCGCTTC-3′) (Fig. 1C). In jE125,
this sequence serves as a cohesive (cos) site [21], suggesting that j644-2 uses the same cos site as jE125.
The nucleotide sequence immediately downstream of
gene36, which encodes a putative site-specific integrase,
contained the candidate attP site of j644-2. It is characterized by a 30-bp sequence that was identical to the 3′
end of a 90-bp serine tRNA (GGA) gene on the B. pseudomallei K96243 small chromosome [3,4] (Fig. 1C).
Interestingly, a 19-kb prophage-like island (GI13) is also
integrated at this location in the B. pseudomallei
K96243 genome [3,4], although there is no sequence
similarity between the two elements.
Inferred prophage islands

Twenty-four putative prophage or prophage-like regions
were identified in 11 of the 20 Burkholderia strains
(Table 1B). In addition, two GIs from K96243 (GI3 and
GI15) were included in subsequent analysis since these
also classify as putative prophage by our definition [3].
We call these regions prophage islands (PI) defined as
regions of the genome that were found to contain most
if not all of the elements characteristic of prophages (see
Materials and Methods), but have not been isolated and
experimentally characterized. Most B. pseudomallei and
all B. multivorans strains were found to contain PIs;
three were identified in B. thailandensis E264, one in
B. xenovorans LB400, and none in any of the B. mallei

Ronning et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:202
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/202

strains. The three B. thailandensis E264 PIs, PI-E264-1,
-2, and -3, correspond to B. thailandensis GI1, Bt GI13,
and Bt GI12, respectively, as described by Yu et al [24],
although the range of genes in the PIs described here
differ slightly due to our criteria for inclusion. Similarly,
PI-668-1 corresponds to GI15c from B. pseudomallei
MSHR668 in Tuanyok et al [4]. As mentioned above, no
PIs were detected in B. pseudomallei 1106a/b, although
phage-like remnants were found in these strains. Overall, seventeen of the 24 identified regions were located
on chromosome I of the respective bacterial strain, and
all but five were putative prophages (i.e., most likely to
be active prophages containing all of the prophage-like
elements described in the Materials and Methods). Of
the seven regions located on chromosome II, one (PIE264-3) was classified as a putative prophage, while the
remaining six were designated prophage-like.
Paired strains B. pseudomallei 1710a/b and B.
pseudomallei 1106a/b

The two pairs B. pseudomallei 1710a/b and B. pseudomallei 1106a/b represent two bacterial strains isolated at
different time points from the same two infected
patients, isolated from the primary infection (a) and the
relapse (b). We hypothesized that difference/s in
sequence relating to the relapse or host selection would
be detected, either in the form of SNPs/indels or as variation in the phage harbored within each strain. Three
PIs were identified in each of the B. pseudomallei 1710
strains. PI-1710a/b-1 is immediately followed by PI1710a/b-2 on chromosome I, separated by a tRNA pseudogene in each strain. This region is described as GI6b
in Tuanyok et al. [4]. PI-1710a/b-3 is located further
downstream on chromosome I. All three regions are
nearly identical, averaging 98.4, 97.7, and 96.6% identity
over 98.2, 97.1, and 96.2% of length (for -1, -2, and -3,
respectively). PI-1710a-1 and PI-1710b-1 are 41.3 and
41.4 kb in length, respectively, and both are bounded by
tRNA-Pseudo-2 and a 23 bp exact repeat of the 3′ end
of this tRNA. Both PI-1710a-2 and PI-1710b-2 are 60.6
kb in size and are bounded by tRNA-Pro-2 and a 49 bp
exact repeat. The prophage-like regions in both strains
(PI-1710a-3, PI-1710b-3) are defined by the presence of
a phage integrase at the 3′ end by tRNA-Thr-3, with
several viral-like proteins immediately upstream, but no
repeat region could be identified to define the 5′ end.
Both are 62.8 kb. Since the three prophage islands are
nearly identical between B. pseudomallei 1710a and B.
pseudomallei 1710b, from here on we will only refer to
B. pseudomallei 1710b and associated prophage islands.
These results indicate that the prophage in Bp 1710a/b
were not excised and did not experience any significant
changes even after passage through a host.

Page 10 of 17

By the definitions set forth for prophage islands given
in this work, no PIs were identified in either of the B.
pseudomallei 1106 strains. Tuanyok et al. [4] described
16 genomic islands in 1106a, one of which was identified as a putative prophage (GI10.2; BURPS1106A_3666
- 3701). However, this region also contains three transposases, and so was not considered in the analysis
reported here.
Bacteriophage clusters

Results from the Dotter analysis allowed a preliminary
clustering of prophages and prophage-like regions.
These groups were further refined by examination of
BLASTP protein distance data, resulting in the clustering of 32 of the 37 PIs and prophages into each of
four groups (data not shown). Cluster composition was
very similar between the three BLASTP-distance
FITCH trees and agreed with DOTTER results,
although branch positions varied slightly (Fig. 2).
Seven prophages/PIs clustered into the Siphoviridaelike group, so named because of the inclusion of the
previously published bacteriophages j1026b [6] and
jE125 [21]. Bacteriophage j644-2, described in this
study, is also a member of this group (Fig. 2). Prophages in this group have long non-contractile tails
and termini with cohesive ends. The cos site, present
in j1026b and jE125, was identified in all other members of this group.
The Myoviridae-like group consists of 15 prophages/
PIs (Fig. 2). Phages in this group, identified by the inclusion of jK96243 (GI2) [3] and j52237, typically have
contractile tails and terminal repeats [48]. Three subgroups were identified within the Myoviridae-like class
(Fig. 2). Subgroup A contains jK96243, j52237, jE202,
and four other prophages/PIs. Bacteriophage jE12-2
and five prophages/PIs clustered to form subgroup B,
including two (PI-406E-2 and PI-S13-2) which appear to
be more distantly related. The Mu-like Myoviridae
group contains only two prophages: BcepMu [29] and
jE255. Both left and right phage ends at the host/phage
junction in BcepMu [29] were located at the ends of
jE255, with 95% and 91% identity, respectively. No significant identity was found between either of the two
Mu-like prophages and any of the other prophages or
prophage-like sequences.
Two undefined groups were also identified: undefined1 contains four PIs, and undefined-2 has five (Fig.2).
Interestingly, undefined-2 contains five of the eight PIs
identified in the three B. multivorans strains. Finally, six
sequences had no significant similarity to any other
sequence and were thus considered unclustered, including PI-668-1, PI-406E-1, PI-LB400-1, GI3, Bcep22 and
Bcep781.

Burkholderia bacteriophages are populated by morons

Genomic comparisons of all the phages in each class
revealed that the genomes are arranged in mosaic structures. Each of the phylogenetic classes of phages contains
distinct local collinear blocks (LCB), also called synteny

Page 11 of 17

blocks, which are differentially present among the phages
in that group (Fig. 3). Within each group, the synteny
blocks are shuffled among the genomes (Fig. 3), suggesting
that several of the phages have undergone dramatic genomic rearrangements. In several instances, synteny blocks

Figure 3 Comparative alignment of B. pseudomallei phage and prophage-like regions. Colors indicate local collinear blocks (LCB or
synteny blocks) between phages and PI, the level of similarity between sequences is directly proportional to the height of the colored bars
within the LCB. Rectangles highlight hotspots where different morons integrated in each of the genomes. Ovals highlight the same moron
which integrates at the same location in each genome, but is differentially present among genomes within the same groups and is present in
different phylogenetic groups. Genome comparisons and LCB calculations were performed using Mauve software [34].

Ronning et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:202
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/202

were either abruptly cut off at one end, or a predicted ORF
appeared within the block in one genome, but was absent
in other phages (see white areas within LCB in Fig. 3). We
hypothesized that these randomly occurring ORFs could
be morons, i.e. genetic elements that integrate between
adjacent phage genes, which may confer some additional
fitness to the bacteriophage [20]. Aside from being
inserted among phage genes, morons usually (i) have their
own transcriptional control system (a promoter, operator,
and/or terminator), (ii) have a different GC content than
the rest of the phage, and (iii) may be found in more than
one class of phage [20].
In most cases, the randomly occurring ORFs detected
by LCB analysis of the Burkholderia phages displayed at
least 2 of the characteristics of morons (data not
shown), and thus we classified them as morons themselves. In total, 17 different morons were identified
among the phages and prophages-like islands (Table 2).
Some of the PI/phages had as many as 12 morons, while
some had as few as 2 (Table 2). Among different phage
genomes, morons appeared adjacent to homologous
genes across phylogenetic groups (see ovals in Fig. 3),
and in many cases, some regions seemed to be hotspots
for moron entry since different morons were detected at
the same location (see below; Fig. 4).
Analysis of predicted functions of the Burkholderia
morons shows that several of these proteins may
enhance bacteriophage fitness, and thus replication, as
proposed for other morons [20]. For example, two different morons containing toxin-antitoxin modules were
found among the Myoviridae and Siphoviridae groups
(Table 2). Interestingly, the T-A module in the Myoviridae phages is similar to two modules present in other B.
pseudomallei and even B. mallei strains in regions containing phage remnants (data not shown), suggesting
that this moron can persist even after the phage has
been excised from the genome.
Several of the morons appeared to enhance the
metabolic versatility of the host: aromatic compound
degradation, iron transport and acquisition, and sulfate
assimilation (Table 2). For example, it has been suggested that the PAPS reductase gene, which functions
in the assimilatory sulfate reduction pathway, could
serve as a fitness factor under conditions of iron limitation for the lysogens that harbor prophages encoding this enzyme [42]. PAPS reductase genes were
identified in three members of the Siphoviridae-like
group, jE125, j644-2 and PI-E264-3 (Fig. 4), and in
the Myoviridae-like B subgroup member PI-E264-2.
The PAPS reductase moron incorporated between two
highly conserved phage genes (Fig. 4) at a location that
appears to be an insertion hotspot, since the other
members of this group contain different morons (Fig.
4 and rectangles in Fig. 3).

Page 12 of 17

Other morons appear to be associated with enhanced
host or bacteriophage competitiveness. For example,
morons within the Myoviridae, Undefined-1, Undefined2, and Siphoviridae encode for the production of toxins
that inhibit the growth of competing bacterial strains
(bacteriocins) and/or their associated translocation
mechanisms (Table 2). Other morons could prevent
infection of their host by other phage, these include
morons that encode for site-specific endonucleases,
DNA methylases, restriction-modification systems,
phage abortive infection resistance, and phage-growth
limiting genes. Although we could not confirm that GI3
from K96243 contains morons (since LCB analysis was
limited to those PIs that formed clusters), two separate
reverse-transcriptase (RT) modules are encoded in this
PI. Many phage-encoded RT described to date also
function in phage resistance by directly targeting other
phage DNA.
Lastly, some of the morons encode for proteins associated with bacterial virulence (Table 2). Two different
morons encode patatin-like phospholipases (PTP),
which in P. aeruginosa can act as cytotoxins necessary
for virulence in amoeba and contribute to lung injury in
a mouse model [18,49,50]. Moreover, a prophageencoded phosholipase in group A Streptococcus also
appears to enhance virulence and its expression results
in more severe disease [49]. Two other morons encode
for a proteophosphoglycan and a lytic transglycosylase,
both of which have been associated with virulence in
other pathogens [51]. Thus, some phages in Burkholderia spp. might also be implicated in enhanced
virulence.
Moron and phage genes are differentially expressed in
Bp DD503

We performed transcription analysis using RNAseq to
determine to what extent phage genes and morons are
expressed in j1026b. The results demonstrate that most
phage genes are normally not expressed in rich laboratory growth conditions (Table 3), and allowed us to
determine at least one putative repressor that maintains
such regulation. For j1026b, the candidate repressor
gene (phi1026bp79) had a very high expression value
which was 4-times higher than any of the phage structural or replication genes, (Table 3). The protein (gp78)
contains a divergent AAA domain involved in ATPbinding and has similarities to other proteins annotated
as transcriptional factors, such as YP_002500546 from
Methylobacterium nodulans ORS 2060. Most of the
phage morphogenesis and replication genes are only
expressed at low levels, with many genes (54 of 89
genes) not having any detectable expression (Table 3).
In many phages, gene expression and lysogenic conversion occur only when the levels of the repressor protein

drop below a certain threshold. None of the other
phages identified in this study had proteins with homology to this putative repressor suggesting that their
mechanisms of regulation are different.
In addition to the highly expressed repressor, several of
the morons in j1026b were also expressed, consistent
with the notion that morons are differentially regulated
from the rest of the prophage genes as proposed by Hendrix et al [20]. The toxin-antidote morons were highly
expressed, with the toxin gene (phi1026bp82) 1.5-fold
higher than the antidote gene (phi1026bp81; Table 3).
The DNA methylase and restriction modification moron
(phi1026bp28-30), major facilitator permease, LysR transcriptional regulator and other morons with hypothetical
proteins present among the genome were also highly
expressed (Table 3) independently of the phage genes in
their vicinity, further suggesting that phages represent a
rich source of fitness factors that benefit the host even
while the phage genes are repressed.

Conclusions
The vast diversity in pathogenicity, clinical presentation, and living environments that exists within and
between the Burkholderiae can be attributed at least in
part to the presence of prophages and prophage-like
elements within the genomes of these microbes. In this
report we have characterized and classified 37 prophages, putative prophages, and prophage-like elements identified from several Burkholderia species and
strains within species. Five spontaneously produced
bacteriophages of lysogenic B. pseudomallei and B.
thailandensis were isolated and characterized, including their host range, genome structure, and gene content. Using bioinformatic techniques, 24 putative
prophages and prophage-like elements were identified
within whole genome sequences of various Burkholderia species. Interestingly, while putative prophages
were found in all but one of the B. pseudomallei
strains none were detected in any of the B. mallei

strains searched. The B. mallei genome is nearly identical to that of B. pseudomallei, differing by several
contiguous gene clusters in B. pseudomallei that
appear to have been deleted from B. mallei, and it is
hypothesized that B. mallei evolved from a single B.
pseudomallei strain [8,9]. If true, it is likely that this B.
pseudomallei strain had at least one prophage within
its genome that was excised from B. mallei leaving
behind a toxin-antitoxin module. The prophage excision was part of a major host adaptation in B. mallei
that also removed ~1200 other genes [8]. In addition,
B. mallei is largely confined to a mammalian host in
nature and is less likely to be exposed to new bacteriophages in this niche relative to other Burkholderia species that are commonly found in the soil/plant
rhizosphere. Taken together, prophage elimination and
limited prophage acquisition probably account for the
lack of functional prophages in the B. mallei genome.

Sequences of the five isolated and sequenced bacteriophages, the 24 inferred prophages, and eight previously
published Burkholderia prophages or putative prophages
were classified based on nucleotide and protein
sequence similarity, and an unrooted radial tree was
constructed to estimate genetic relatedness between
them. Several sequences could be classified as Siphoviridae-like, Myoviridae-like, or Mu-like Myoviridae based
on similarity to phages known to be members of these
groups. Additionally, two novel groups were detected,
and five prophages/PIs could not be grouped with other
phages. For the most part the phage groups were represented across all species and strains, with the notable
exception of the undefined-2 group, which is composed
primarily of B. multivorans-derived PIs (five from B.
multivorans, one from B. pseudomallei), albeit loosely
related. Further work that includes prophages derived
from environmental and clinical isolates from other

Burkholderia species as well as from other microbes is
needed to refine these relationships.
Burkholderia spp. are responsible for a number of
potentially devastating infectious diseases for which no
vaccines currently exist. The presence of a wide variety
of bacteriophages within these bacteria opens the possibility that phage therapy may be developed to augment
present antibiotic treatments. We present here a detailed
comparative analysis of gene content within and
between groups of bacteriophages, putative prophages,
and prophage-like regions in various Burkholderia species and strains. Several interesting genes and gene
groups associated with pathogenicity and various metabolic functions were identified within specific groups.
This study provides the first estimate of the relative contribution of prophages to the vast phenotypic diversity
found among the Burkholderiae.
