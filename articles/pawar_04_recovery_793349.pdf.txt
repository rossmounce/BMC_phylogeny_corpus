Abstract
Background: Community recovery following primary habitat alteration can provide tests for
various hypotheses in ecology and conservation biology. Prominent among these are questions
related to the manner and rate of community assembly after habitat perturbation. Here we use
space-for-time substitution to analyse frog and lizard community assembly along two gradients of
habitat recovery following slash and burn agriculture (jhum) in Mizoram, Northeast India. One
recovery gradient undergoes natural succession to mature tropical rainforest, while the other
involves plantation of jhum fallows with teak Tectona grandis monoculture.
Results: Frog and lizard communities accumulated species steadily during natural succession,
attaining characteristics similar to those from mature forest after 30 years of regeneration. Lizards
showed higher turnover and lower augmentation of species relative to frogs. Niche based
classification identified a number of guilds, some of which contained both frogs and lizards.
Successional change in species richness was due to increase in the number of guilds as well as the
number of species per guild. Phylogenetic structure increased with succession for some guilds.
Communities along the teak plantation gradient on the other hand, did not show any sign of change
with chronosere age. Factor analysis revealed sets of habitat variables that independently
determined changes in community and guild composition during habitat recovery.
Conclusions: The timescale of frog and lizard community recovery was comparable with that
reported by previous studies on different faunal groups in other tropical regions. Both communities
converged on primary habitat attributes during natural vegetation succession, the recovery being
driven by deterministic, nonlinear changes in habitat characteristics. On the other hand, very little
faunal recovery was seen even in relatively old teak plantation. In general, tree monocultures are
unlikely to support recovery of natural forest communities and the combined effect of shortened
jhum cultivation cycles and plantation forestry could result in landscapes without mature forest.
Lack of source pools of genetic diversity will then lead to altered vegetation succession and faunal
community reassembly. It is therefore important that the value of habitat mosaics containing even
patches of primary forest and successional secondary habitats be taken into account.

Background
Evaluation of the importance of various processes determining community structure and function is an important topic in ecology. Unlike just a decade or so ago, few
studies today question whether or not community assembly is strictly random, recognizing the role of both stochastic and deterministic processes [1]. This change can be
attributed to accumulating data on organisation in experimental and natural communities, and new perspectives
gained from the fields of evolutionary population ecology
and phylogenetics ([2] e.g., [3,4]). It is worth noting that
empirical tests for much of this theory have been
attempted relatively recently in experimental microcosms
research in particular, yielding valuable insights into the
role of processes in driving long-term community dynamics [5].
This newfound view of community ecology is an excitingly realistic one, and has the potential to make valuable
contributions to conservation biology as well [6,7]. However, though studies on long term dynamics of communities are obviously important, they are extremely difficult
to implement. A vast majority of field studies are restricted
to exploring correlates and predictors of species diversity
and other emergent community properties. This is in part
due to the problems associated with studying complex
natural communities. But to a great extent, difficulties also
arise because community ecology studies have traditionally been skewed towards relatively long-lived vertebrate
groups, or are restricted to short study periods due to
logistical constraints, especially in the tropics [8,9].
Although these studies yield valuable information, they
are carried out at timescales that at best, give insight into
short-term processes, providing limited information
about community organization, persistence, or assembly.
Circumventing this problem is obviously very difficult.
One possible approach is to study communities along gradients of habitat succession using space-for-time substitution (SFT) to obtain chronosequential communities [10].
Thus, instead of studying changes in a single community
over time, successional habitats of known ages that can be
arranged on a temporal gradient are compared. This
method can reveal changes in community structure, environmental predictors of these changes, and provide estimates of the rate of community change [11-14]. Although
many studies have examined recovery of faunal communities with tropical forest regeneration, a vast majority
have been restricted to one or two vertebrate (birds, small
mammals) and invertebrate (ants, beetles) groups [10].
For example, 19 of the 33 studies reviewed by Dunn [10],
were on vertebrates, out of which only two were on
amphibians and/or reptiles. Considering that amphibians
and reptiles are ectothermic and have life history traits different from mammals and birds [9], more data on these

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/4/10

taxonomic groups is important to test the generality of
conclusions about effects of tropical habitat alteration on
fauna.
This study takes an SFT approach to compare changes in
frog and lizard community structure in two contrasting
habitat succession gradients: (a) 1-yr jhum fallows giving
way to mature forest, and (b) 1-yr jhum fallows planted
over with teak, leading to monoculture stands. Slash-andburn or shifting cultivation (jhum) agriculture involves
clearing and burning of forest patches, so the original
rainforest communities are effectively obliterated, and
succession involves recovery of communities from
scratch. The following questions were addressed in this
study:
1. How much does frog and lizard community succession
differ between the two gradients of habitat recovery?
2. Does composition of the entire community change in
synchrony, or does the recovery pattern differ between
subcommunities such as frogs vs. lizards and guilds?
3. What aspects of habitat change influence frog and lizard
community recovery, and if habitat parameters are linked
to niche axes, do they predict changes in guild
composition?
4. Do successional changes in guilds also show trends in
phylogenetic structure? This last question is expected to
yield interesting insights into possible evolutionary mechanisms underlying changes in community composition
[15], but has not explicitly been addressed in previous
work on faunal recovery during tropical forest regeneration (cf. [10], and references therein).
In this paper, a chronosere is defined as a habitat that has
recovered from perturbation for a known length of time,
and can be assigned a place in the SFT. An assemblage is
the set of all species of a taxonomic group in a landscape
of interest. Ecological groups (EGs) are species' subsets of
the assemblage with similar niche characteristics. Communities comprise species of the assemblage which share
a habitat stratum (i.e., chronosere) in the landscape.
Guilds are members of the EGs that actually coexist in the
same chronosere i.e., belong to the same community, and
are thus likely to have ecological and evolutionary interactions (cf. [16]).
To draw inferences about what aspects of habitat change
determine sequential communities, habitat and frog-lizard community data were analysed hierarchically. As a
first step, species richness and turnover of frog and lizard
communities along habitat recovery gradients was summarised, and the entire assemblage classified into

Page 2 of 18

BMC Ecology 2004, 4:10

ecological groups (EGs) based on niche similarities.
Guilds identified from this classification were then examined for phylogenetic structure. Using factor analysis,
orthogonal combinations of variables that described
biotic and abiotic aspects of habitat transition were
extracted. We then tested for correspondence between
these composite variables and composition of frogs and
lizard communities and guilds. Based upon the relationships between different habitat factors and frog and lizard
communities, variables were interpreted as composite
adaptive zones, and we tested whether they predicted successional changes at different levels of community
organization.

Results and Discussion
Gradients of vegetation recovery
Table 1 shows details of the chronosere sampling plots
(see Additional file 2 for photographs of chronoseres).
Both the 1-yr post-jhum fallows (plots jh1A and B) were
dominated by herbaceous plants, tall grass, shrubs and
wild bananas, along with saplings and surviving crop
plants. The 4 to 5-yr post-jhum plot (jh5) was dominated
by almost homogeneous stands of the bamboo Melocanna
baccifera, interspersed with a few shrubs and trees. Herbs
were rare, and the understorey sparse. The 7 to 10-yr postjhum plot (jh10) was very similar to jh5. However, here
the bamboo culms were more sparsely distributed, and
along with M. baccifera, two other bamboos- Dendrocalamus longispathus and Bambusa tulda were in greater abundance, and woody plants were relatively more common.
Compared to the other plots, a larger area was included in
the 30 to 35-yr jhum plot (jh35) because it contained a
greater range of ages and hence perhaps more variability.
Also, this was the only accessible site in the study area that
represented a chronosere aged between 30–50 years.
Although M. baccifera was common, this site had a greater
abundance of other bamboos and trees than any of the
previous stages. Though most trees were small, woody
vegetation formed a significant part of the canopy. Herbs
and shrubs were rare, and the understorey generally
sparse.

The three mature forest plots (matA, B, and C) were of
untraceable age (probably >100 years old; [12]). They
were characterized by high tree density, canopy cover, and
a sparse understorey with few herbs or true shrubs (not
tree saplings). One of the sites (matA) was slightly disturbed by dead wood and palm leaf extraction, and had a
relatively dense understorey in places. Bamboos were
mainly restricted to moist gullies, and occasionally in the
understorey.
The 4-yr teak plot (tk4) was a young plantation characterized by a monodominant stand of teak trees. The understorey was sparse, with some tall grass, shrubs (mainly

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/4/10

Lantana camara) and occasional herbs. The 22-yr teak
plantation site (tk22) had a monotonous, uniform structure characteristic of a mature, managed teak monoculture. Undergrowth was sparse, consisting mostly of tall
grass and Lantana sp. Table 2 summarises differences in
four habitat parameters that show broad contrasts
between chronoseres. These results are very similar to
those of a another study in the same region [12]. For the
purposes of these comparisons, data for the two undisturbed mature forest plots matB and matC are presented
together because they are were very similar in macrohabitat characteristics.
Eight factors were extracted after Principal Component
Analysis (PCA), and by Varimax rotation of the factor
structure, which explained a cumulative 85.8% of the variation (see methods). Eigenvalues, factor loadings and
factor scores are given in Additional file 3. The ordination
of the sampling plots based on scores of the first two PCA
factors is shown in Figure 1. This ordination was very similar to one obtained by non-metric multidimensional
scaling (NMDS) [17]. The two gradients of vegetation
recovery have very different trajectories of change in habitat attributes. The predominant macro-habitat characteristic along the factor 1 axis is high bamboo abundance,
while high positive loading on the factor 2 axis indicates
tree-forest dominated habitat. The gradient towards
mature forest succession includes intermediate stages
dominated by bamboo, which are succeeded by a tree
dominated forest.
In general, although there is a change towards a tree dominated habitat in both recovery gradients, the end result is
very different because the 22 year teak plantation is a
monoculture, whereas the mature forest consists of a
diverse tree community.
Successional changes in frog and lizard communities
The three sampling techniques used in conjunction during the study (see methods) yielded sixteen frog and seventeen lizard species. Figure 2 shows changes in species
richness, and Figure 3 differences in community composition for frogs and lizards along the two recovery gradients.
Clearly, there are distinct similarities in overall community composition between the early jhum fallows and teak
plantation communities on one hand, and the mature forest and the 35 year jhum fallows on the other.

The pattern of recovery is very different for the two gradients. For the mature forest succession gradient, the rate of
frog and lizard community recovery is similar to that
found for birds by Raman [12] in the same region in
Northeast India, with the community approaching
mature forest characteristics after about 30 years. Even
more remarkably, this timescale is also comparable with

those reported by similar studies on other fauna elsewhere
in the tropics [10]. The gradient from jhum to mature teak
plantations on the other hand, seems to show little
change in species richness or composition even after 22
years of plantation growth.

(DA) consists of five agamid lizards, some of whom are
occasionally terrestrial. The diurnal terrestrial (DT) group
consists of six skinks and one lacertid lizard. More
detailed natural history descriptions of these species can
be found in Pawar [17].

It is worth noting that there are dissimilarities in the manner of species accumulation for frogs vs. lizards. There is
much less augmentation of species number in the case of
the latter, the main reason for this being that younger
chronoseres support more lizard than frog species richness. Species accumulation curves (see Additional file 4)
show that these differences are not sampling artefacts.
Moreover, across chronosere species turnover (see methods) for lizards is significantly higher than that for frogs
(Student's t-test, two tail p < 0.05), indicating that lizard
community succession was characterized by relatively
high replacement and low accumulation of species.

Figure 5 shows how EGs are represented along the two
recovery gradients. In this paper, representatives of each
EG in a sampling plot are considered guilds of that chronosere. Clearly, the number of guilds as well as number of
species per guild increases with succession along the gradient leading to mature forest, but not along the one leading to teak monoculture. The species accumulation during
natural forest succession is mainly due to augmentation of
crepuscular and nocturnal guilds. It is also worth noting
that the DT and DA groups, which are consistently present
along both gradients of recovery, also have the maximum
niche overlap (distance between pairs of species is the
smallest for these groups in the NMDS niche space). The
implication of this fact is discussed below. It is due to
these two guilds that successional lizard communities
show the high species turnover and low accumulation
noted above.

Guilds
Ecological groups defined by non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) of the niche based dissimilarity
matrix for the entire assemblage are shown in Figure 4.
The NMDS configuration was derived in 2 dimensions
with low stress and high RSQ values, indicating a very
good representation of actual niche dissimilarities [18].
On dimension 1, the dominant niche characteristic determining high negative loadings is arboreality, and high
positive values indicate that the species is predominantly
terrestrial. On dimension 2, higher positive values indicate predominantly diurnal diel activity pattern, and negative values indicate crepuscular and/or nocturnal activity
pattern. Identities of species in each group are in Additional file 4. Of the five EGs, two consist of both frogs and
lizards: the nocturnal arboreal (NA) group with eight species of frogs (mostly tree frogs) and four species of lizards
(all gekkonid lizards), and the crepuscular-nocturnal terrestrial (CT) group, which consists of seven frogs and one
crepuscular-nocturnal lizard. The diurnal arboreal group

Phylogenetic structure
Figure 6 shows the ratio of species to genera (S/G ratio) of
guilds in different chronoseres. The S/G ratio increased
with succession towards mature forest in the NA guild,
and to a lesser extent, in the CT guild. The S/G ratio of the
NA, DT and DA guilds was variable, and did not change
directionally with habitat recovery. In general, across all
chronoseres irrespective of which recovery gradient they
belonged to, the number of guilds represented in each
chronosere was positively correlated with phylogenetic
structure (S/G ratio averaged across guilds; Spearman R =
0.92, p < 0.0002) and the species richness of the chronosere (R = 0.88, p < 0.01). This suggests that the ability of
chronoseres to support a larger number of guilds predicts
species number as well as phylogenetic structure.

Plot of scores of first two PCA factors. Vectors are drawn to show the trajectories of the two gradients of habitat recovery.
The chronosere codes are as follows- jh1A, 1B, 5, 10 &35: jhum fallows ranging from 1 to 35 years; tk4 &22: teak plantation 4
and 22 years old; matA, B, &C: mature forest plots. See methods and Table 1 for more details.

These results on successional changes in guild structure
and representation indicate a distinctly non-random
sequence of community assembly, as certain guilds
appear in later stages, followed by increase in their species
richness and in many cases, phylogenetic structure.
Habitat attributes that determine these changes are
explored in the next section (see below).
Correspondence between habitat factors and frog-lizard
community succession
Table 3 shows the results of correspondence tests between
Euclidean dissimilarity matrices calculated from the eight
PCA factors and frog-lizard species compositional
dissimilarity matrices for different levels of community
structure. As the factor structure of the PCA analysis was
rotated to maximize the orthogonality of factor loadings,
these matrix correspondence tests are statistically similar
to performing partial mantel tests (partial correlation)
with multiple variables [19]. The hierarchical nature of

the correlations in Table 3 and the fact that guilds are correlated with different, orthogonal composite variables is
interesting, and offers answers to the third question
addressed this paper: what aspects of habitat change influence frog and lizard community recovery at different levels of community organization?
Higher-order community structure
The strongest association is between factor 2 and overall
species composition (frogs and lizards combined) across
chronoseres. Factor 2 was strongly and non-linearly
correlated with age along both teak and mature forest
succession gradients (logarithmic fit, R2 = 0.85, and 0.97,
respectively), and represents deterministic, linear aspects
of vegetation succession. It has high positive loadings for
tree species richness, and macro-habitat variables such as
tree density, canopy cover, and canopy height, most of
which increase deterministically along both gradients of
habitat change. Among the measured variables, these are

Change in
Change in species richness of frogs and lizards with chronosere age along teak plantation and mature forest recovery gradients.
Both gradients have 1 yr jhum fallows (jh1A&B) as the starting point. The number of species increases logarithmically with succession towards mature forest for both taxonomic groups, but the change is much more striking in the case of frogs. Species
richness does not seem to change much with recovery time on the teak gradient. The age of mature forest, known to be >100
years old, was assigned an arbitrary value of 150 years.

primary and independent, which over time drive changes
in secondary (microhabitat) variables such as bamboo
density, shrub abundance, and various measures of habitat heterogeneity (see methods). This factor clearly influences species composition at all levels of frog and lizard
community structure.
Frog vs. Lizards
Along with factor 2, the frog subcommunity was also associated with factor 7, which shows no significant age determinacy along either gradient of habitat recovery. This
factor has high positive loading for soil moisture content,
which is an important limiting factor for frogs. The lizard
subcommunity was associated with factor 8 along with
factor 2. Factor 8 has high loading for soil moisture variability, which is highest in chronoseres with spatial variation in insolation. This factor is crucial for diurnal lizards,

many of which are heliotherms. Factors 7 and 8 are probably also surrogates of unmeasured or unclassified
variables which influence successional changes in these
two communities.
Guilds
Three out of five guilds are secondarily correlated with factors orthogonal to factor 2. The two that were not, i.e., the
diurnal-arboreal (DA) and diurnal-terrestrial (DT)
groups, were correlated with factor 2. This suggests that in
contrast to other guilds, these two, which are both made
up only of lizards, are directly influenced by a hierarchically higher order of habitat attributes.

These were also the two groups that showed non directional trends in species richness as well as phylogenetic
trends along habitat recovery gradients (Figures 5 and 6).

Along with factor 2, the crepuscular-nocturnal terrestrial
(CT) group was correlated with factor 1 and 4. Factor 1
scores increase and then decrease with plot age along both
habitat recovery gradients (2nd order polynomial fit, R2=
0.99, and 0.82, respectively). This factor had high loading
(defined as ≥ ± 0.65; see Additional file 3) positive for
both macro- and micro-habitat variables such as bamboo
density canopy cover, leaf litter cover and depth and
negative loadings for many habitat heterogeneity variables such as CVs of canopy cover and litter cover. These
variables are interpretable as ones that are associated with,
or influence ground microhabitat conditions. Factor 4
decreased logarithmically with age along both teak and
mature forest gradients (R2 = 0.62, and 0.34, respectively).
This factor had no strong loadings, but is associated with
shrub density, canopy height variability and tree density,
all of which also affect ground cover, and can be considered macrohabitat variables.

The nocturnal arboreal frog group (NA(F)), was correlated
with factor 7, which is non-deterministic with respect to
chronosere age. This factor as a high loading for soil moisture, which by itself is difficult to interpret as a variable
directly affecting this ecomorphological group. It is likely
that this factor is a surrogate for an unmeasured or unclassified variable. Lastly, the nocturnal arboreal lizard group
(NA(L)) is correlated with factor 8 along with factor 2.
Factor 8 shows a weak negative linear relationship with
recovery age along both gradients gradient (R2 = 0.209
and 0.18 for teak and mature forest gradients, respectively). It has high positive loading for CV of soil moisture, which as mentioned above, is highest in chronoseres
with spatial and/or temporal variation in insolation.
Among the measured variables, factor 2 probably subsumes most habitat parameters that affect both NA groups
directly (see next section).

Adaptive zones?
Can biologically meaningful adaptive zones be interpreted from these associations? As each factor is orthogonal with respect to the others, factors subsume different
habitat variables, or their variability in the same variable.
Note that the composite variable represented by each
factor consists of negative as well as positive loadings of
variables. This means that if a guild was associated with a
factor, both positive and negative trends in different variables affected it simultaneously, together representing a
composite adaptive zone. However, an important fact to
consider here is that these "adaptive zones" thus identified may actually be surrogates for actual sets of unmeasured variables. Raman [12] inferred that floristics (tree
species composition) and physiognomy (vertical stratification) were the dominant habitat attributes that inde-

pendently predicted changes in bird species composition
at the level of communities, but not at much at the level
of guilds. In the case of frogs and lizards, factor 2, which
includes a measure of floristic attributes (tree species
diversity), is a strong predictor of frog and lizard community composition at all levels. But factor 2 also includes
numerous structural attributes that are correlated with tree
species diversity, from canopy height to understorey and
ground habitat structure, all of which have equal or higher
positive loadings. Also, Figure 7 shows that understorey
habitat complexity increases with post-jhum succession
towards mature forest.
Thus, it is difficult to infer the extent to which tree species
diversity per se influences frog and lizard community
structure. Previous work has shown that unlike endother-

likely to be influenced more strongly by abiotic rather
than biotic features [20]. The effect of physiognomy on

the other hand, is definitely important, though at a different scale than for birds. The idea that a habitat with higher
structural complexity will support more species [21-25],

and have a strong influence on re-colonisation success
[26], has been shown for amphibians and reptiles (but see
[27]). It can therefore be inferred that factor 2 subsumes
nested subsets of biotic and abiotic variables that directly
affect the (mean) fitnesses of species' populations in different guilds. Also, it is clear that guilds are also associated
with other, independent variables sets that can be

considered to comprise additional aspects of each member species' adaptive zone.
Factors 3, 5, and 6 showed no significant association with
any level of community composition. The obvious reason
for this appears to be that unlike other factors, these are

cession, thus representing temporally and/or spatially stochastic attributes that were unlikely to show any influence
on the conspicuously deterministic nature of frog and lizard community and guild (except for the DT and DA
groups) succession (See Figures 2,3,5 and 6). At this resolution, it is impossible to say whether these variables are
adaptively significant for certain subgroups/species of
frogs and lizards or not. Nevertheless, this complex,
nested pattern of these alleged adaptive zones, is
ecologically realistic (see [28]). Although difficult to interpret at this level of resolution, this hierarchical partitioning of variables is an indicator of which attributes of
habitat change influence community assembly and turnover with such gradients of vegetation succession.
Composite variables and successional changes in
community characteristics
Table 4 shows the predictive ability of the different habitat
factors for species richness, guild abundance, and phylogenetic structure in communities and guilds. As expected,
factor 2 predicts increase in overall species richness,
number of guilds represented, and number of species per
guild. However, it does not predict overall phylogenetic
structure (measured as the average of S/G ratios across
guilds represented in each chronosere). Instead, it predicts
the phylogenetic structure of all guilds except DT. Factor 1
predicts species richness as well as S/G ratio in the DA
group, and factor 4 predicts the S/G ratio of NA(L). No
community characteristics were correlated with factors
3,5,6,7 or 8.

The DT group does not show correlation with any of the
factors. Interestingly, this ecological group along with the
DA group, also occupies the smallest niche space (having
the maximum niche overlap in the NMDS space; see Figure 4), has the most consistent presence across

chronoseres (but with species turnover) and a phylogenetic structure that varies non-directionally along successional gradients (Figure 6). Similar patterns have been
observed for diurnal terrestrial herpetofauna (which are
largely lizards) elsewhere [29]. Members of this group
also have the highest population densities, and most have
wide geographic distributions (Pawar, unpublished data).
All these data strongly suggest that this guild is not
resource constrained in chronoseres along the habitat
recovery gradients, and is more randomly assembled during recovery than any of the other groups.
In general, these results help explain the trends seen in
Figures 2,3,5 and 6 by indicating attributes of habitat
change that drive changes in community structure in
successional frog and lizard communities. The succession
of jhum fallow towards mature forest involves a deterministic, directional change in attributes that allow coexistence of successively more speciose and phylogenetically
structured communities. In terms of change in species
richness, these results are qualitatively similar to those of
similar work on bird, butterfly, and reptile communities
[11-13]. Previous work has not however attempted to
look at phylogenetic structure for such successional communities. The jhum to teak monoculture gradient also has
many aspects of deterministic habitat change, but apparently not for the variables that are essential for a diverse
community. The trajectory of habitat change also
indicates that this pattern is unlikely to change with transition towards older plantations either. No previous data
exists on herpetofaunal community changes in post-jhum
monoculture plantations.

Conclusions
0.72 (0.019)

By comparing disparate trajectories of habitat change and
recovery of different taxonomic groups, this study provides useful insights into faunal community change in
response to habitat recovery. To summarise, the results

Page 13 of 18
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Ecology 2004, 4:10

show that (1) The two gradients of habitat recovery are
very different and accordingly affect frog and lizard community assembly differently, (2) Although both groups
increased in species richness with habitat recovery, lizards
had higher species turnover, combined with lower species
augmentation within each recovery gradient (3) Looking
at a finer scale of community organization, assembly
appears to be driven by changes in guild representation
and composition, where some guilds change directionally
with age of habitat recovery by species augmentation,
while others change by species turnover (4) Guilds that
showed directional increase in species richness also
increased in phylogenetic structure (5) Hierarchies of
community organisation were affected by composite,
nested habitat attributes that correspond to particular
niche axes, and (6) the increase in species richness along
the mature forest gradient in contrast to lack of change
along the teak gradient was due to availability (or lack
thereof) of variables that comprise these complex adaptive zones. Also, the results show that a niche-based guild
classification reveals patterns that would have been
hidden in the gross response pattern of the entire
community.
Some indication of the qualitative nature of potential evolutionary and ecological processes in community turnover
comes from the fact that changes in phylogenetic structure
are tied to guild structure in the communities. Using phylogenetic techniques, recent work has demonstrated the
importance of evolutionary adaptation in assembling ecological communities [4]. It is clear that specialisation on
different subsets of resources, in a habitat drive the origin
and as well as persistence of diversity [30]. Frogs and lizards have incongruent patterns of community succession,
mainly because they generally differ in fundamental niche
dimensions axes such as diel activity [31]. However,
although most lizards are diurnal and most frogs nocturnal, there are many sub-lineages that are an exception,
and species do share niche space transcending taxonomic
boundaries (ecological groups in this paper). Such subgroups probably have congruent ecological and evolutionary dynamics.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/4/10

gradients of community change, as phylogenetic and
guild structure increase directionally and in tandem with
succession towards mature forest. Whether this change is
driven by immigration from the regional gene pool or due
to local divergent adaptation is an interesting question
[15]. Reptiles, and to a greater extent amphibians, have
limited dispersal ability compared to most vertebrates.
This distinction in itself may drive differences in local
adaptation and community assembly from other biotic
groups.
Conservation issues
The time scale of recovery on the jhum-rainforest succession gradient, which is about 30 years for both frogs and
lizards, and suggests that recovery of diverse communities
can be relatively fast, as has been reported for other fauna
[10]. However, this pattern of community recovery (or reassembly) is tightly coupled to changes in certain sets of
habitat attributes, which in turn are dependent upon vegetation succession wherein post-jhum chronoseres are
gradually replaced by trees. This vegetation succession is
obviously reliant on seed rain/dispersal from nearby
mature forests. In this region and many other areas Southeast Asia, apart from continued pressure from shifting cultivation and shortening cultivation cycles, it has also
become popular practice to plant and maintain monocultures of timber species. As the results of this study indicate, such plantations are unlikely to support natural
recovery of faunal communities, and will harbour lower
biological diversity compared to primary forest.

It is possible that the combined effects of short jhum
cycles, plantation forestry and invasion by non-native species such as Lantana and Eupatorium will lead to the local
extirpation of even remnant forest patches. This loss of
recolonisation pools for flora and fauna, will alter natural
trajectories of succession, and strongly impact the biological diversity supported by the landscape. It is therefore
important that conservation and prioritisation agencies in
these areas consider the value of habitat mosaics containing even small patches of primary forest vegetation.

Methods
It is an open question as to what extent vegetation succession leads to changes in the number of adaptive peaks and
corresponding changes in mean fitnesses of species' populations such that multiple species can persist in the same
habitat. In more ecological terms this is same as asking
how habitat succession leads to changes in niche availability, occupancy, and overlap (due to character displacement, for example). Another related question, that was
partly explored using the S/G ratios in this paper, is
whether similar adaptive zones (or niches or adaptive
peaks) tend to be occupied by more closely related taxa.
The results here do indicate that this may be true for such

The study was carried out from November 1998 to April
1999 in and around Ngengpui Wildlife Sanctuary (WLS;
21°56'N – 24°31'N and 92°16'E – 93°26'E) in south
Mizoram, Northeast India. The study area covers about
200 sq. km. (see Additional file 1 for maps). A combination of high annual precipitation and temperature, and
low elevation supports a predominantly tropical evergreen [32] climax vegetation in the area. Shifting cultivation is the primary mode of agriculture here. While most
of the area within Ngengpui WLS is mature or primary forest, the surrounding areas are a mosaic of bamboo-dominated sites, mature forest fragments, teak Tectona grandis

plantations and abandoned shifting cultivation (jhum)
fallows of varying ages. All primary forest is referred to as
"mature forest" throughout the paper because it is often
difficult to determine the age of ostensibly primary tropical forest, especially in areas with poorly known history of
land use and recovery [12,33]. Further details and
supporting literature about the geology, vegetation, and
land use patterns in the study area can be found in Pawar
[17].
Sampling plots
Ten sampling plots representing mature and successional
vegetation stages of known ages were established [17]
(Table 1). To control for recolonisation potential, all secondary plots were selected such that at least 50% of the
perimeter abutted mature forest, and the edge was within
100 m from contiguous mature forest. All plots had a
slope of 0–20° and were within an altitudinal range of ca.
150–350 m above sea level. As the study was focused on
terrestrial frogs and lizards, all plots were at least 100 m
away from large perennial water bodies. To minimize spatial autocorrelation, all plots were at least 2 km (straight
distance) from each other, with the replicates (e.g., the
two 1 yr fallows) being the furthest apart (ca. 10 km).
Vegetation sampling, habitat variables and gradients of
habitat recovery
Vegetation composition and habitat structure variables
were sampled on randomly located 10 × 25 m belt
transects [13,17]. Transects were cut short whenever an
edge of the site was reached. The number of transects
sampled were, six each in Jh1A, Jh1B, Jh5, Jh10, and Jh35,
and five each in tk4, tk22, matA, matB and matC. Tree
density and tree species richness was sampled on the
whole area of each transect. All trees >20 cm GBH were
enumerated, while the rest were classified as 'shrubs'.
Density of bamboo culms, shrubs, palms, bananas, and
tall grass clumps was estimated in each of six 2 m radius
circular plots laid at 5 m intervals on the transect, beginning from the starting point of the transect. Percentage
cover of herbaceous forms and leaf litter, dead woody
matter abundance and liana abundance in each circular
plot were estimated visually. Percentage canopy cover
from ground level was estimated with a hand-held canopy
densiometer from the centre of each circular plot. Litter
depth was gauged by pressing a blunt rod of 0.5-cm diameter at 5 random points in each circular plot, and counting
the number of leaves pinned under it.

Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was used to identify different aspects of habitat change with vegetation
succession and collapse the list of raw variables into
composite factors that could potentially predict frog and
lizard community structure. The factor structure was
rotated using the Varimax method to obtain clear loading

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/4/10

patterns [18]. As additional variables, within-habitat coefficient of variation (CV) of variables was also used along
with the raw data as measures of habitat heterogeneity.
Within habitat variation was considered potentially
informative as it is an important feature of the adaptive
landscape [30]. Habitat data were collected at comparable
times of each month for all plots, and these CVs are
unlikely to be due to temporal fluctuations. Data were
square root transformed if they deviated from normality.
For a list of variables used in the analyses, see Additional
file 3.
As the objective of the analysis was to combine variables
into composite, orthogonal factors that could potentially
account for community and guild structure, all factors
with eigenvalues = 0.8 were extracted, irrespective of the
number of factors thus extracted. Although somewhat
arbitrary, in essence this eigenvalue threshold ensured
that a factor was included only if it extracted approximately as much as one raw variable [18]. Although all
extracted factors were used as predictors of community
structure (see below), in order to obtain a graphic, low
dimensional representation of the two gradients of
habitat recovery, scores of only the first two factors were
plotted. Deterministic sets of variables that changed
directionally with chronosere age were identified by
regressing scores of each factor against chronosere ages.
Frog and lizard sampling
The low abundance of amphibians and reptiles and
unstandardised sampling methodology in tropical Asia
reduces the reliability of species diversity estimates and
hence community structure analyses [8]. Taking this problem into consideration, three techniques were used in
conjunction to maximize inventorying effort – (i) belt
transects, (ii) pitfall trapping and (iii) systematic searching. All these techniques are oriented towards sampling
terrestrial, and non-canopy arboreal species, and to further increase the sampling efficiency, the study was
restricted to terrestrial, non-fossorial, and non-canopy
frogs (Amphibia: Anura) and lizards (Reptilia: Sauria,
excluding family Varanidae). Although this excluded a
few amphibian and reptile groups, it ensured that taxonomic groups unsuited for the chosen sampling techniques were not unnecessarily included, thus augmenting
the reliability of the data. To distribute sampling effort
effectively among the ten plots, sampling was carried out
in sampling 'sessions' of ten days each. Eleven such sessions (= 110 days) were completed, starting from 15th
December 1998, to the end of April 1999. Sufficient time
was allocated to all three sampling techniques during each
session.

Belt transects
To improve detection and gather information for delineation of EGs (see below), the traditional transect method
was modified by eliminating pseudoreplication and sampling both nocturnal and diurnal species on the same
transect [34,35]. The former was achieved by establishing
fresh 50(length) × 3(width) × 3(height) m transects during each session, which were sampled only once. To detect
both nocturnal and diurnal taxa, each transect was walked
in both directions (to and fro) by two observers. The diurnal animal walk (DAW) was first, and was conducted at a
steady pace fixed for all plots (ca. 20 min/50 m). Any animal seen leaving the transect area was recorded as being
present on it. Care was taken to cause minimal disturbance to the habitat, and no active searches were done.
The nocturnal animal walk (NAW), conducted in the
direction opposite to the DAW, was focused on intensive
microhabitat searching within the same 50 × 3 × 3 m area.
All nocturnal animals found on the DAW were included
in the analyses, but to reduce the possibility of re-recording the same animal, diurnal animals found on the NAW
were not. Behavioural and microhabitat data were
recorded for every animal detected (see below). All
transects were sampled immediately after they were
established, between 1000–1400 hrs during winter (midDecember to February) and 0900–1300 during summer
(March and April). There was no noticeable species turnover with season, so winter and summer data were not
analyzed separately [17]. The belt transects also yielded
abundance data, which are not used in this paper [17].

Although time taken for the NAW was more or less constant within a chronosere, it varied considerably across
plots. The DAW time on the other hand, was more or less
consistent. This strategy was used because just as sampling
effort needs to be proportional to habitat heterogeneity,
higher microhabitat complexity calls for proportionally
greater searching effort. Figure 7 shows how well this sampling strategy was implemented. There is a strong positive
correlation between an index of microhabitat complexity
(calculated as the sum of the coefficients of variance for
various understorey habitat structure variables listed in
Additional file 3) and time spent on the NAW, but not the
DAW. Thus, though no extra time was needed to sight
active (diurnal) animals in more complex habitats, the
time needed for microhabitat searching (and hence NAW
time) increased along a gradient of increasing habitat
complexity from the 1-yr fallows and teak plots to mature
forest. A total of 192 belt transects were completed, from
a minimum of thirteen in jh1B to thirty-eight in jh35 (See
Figure 7 for sample sizes).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/4/10

of the effects of weather on herpetofaunal activity and
hence sampling efficiency. Comparisons of trapping frequency across plots over the study period are not used in
this paper. Each pitfall array was, 'Y'-shaped, with three
terminal (30 cm diam. × 60 cm depth) and one central
(50 cm diam. × 70 cm depth) cylindrical aluminium funnel pitfall traps buried in the ground. The traps were connected with three opaque plastic-sheet fences (the arms of
the 'Y') 0.4 m high and 5 m long, held up by bamboo
stakes. In all, 22 arrays were placed, with two in each plot
except for the large Jh35, which had four. Arrays were at
comparable distance from plot edges, and on similar
slope. Systematic trapping was initiated ten days after trap
were established. Traps were opened for 5–10 consecutive
days, and checked according to habitat characteristics, taking into consideration the level of exposure trapped animals were likely to be subjected to; plots with open
habitat, such as jh1A were checked most (every alternate
day) and those with relatively closed habitat such as matA
were checked least frequently (every third day). Most specimens (95.2 %) obtained from pitfall trapping were
released a minimum of 100 m away from the array, either
in the same site, or in similar habitat elsewhere. A few
were retained as voucher specimens.
Systematic searching
At the end of a sampling session in a plot, far ranging
searches were carried out. This augmented species inventorying, and provided information crucial for EG classification (see below). Periodically, nocturnal searches were
also made to collect information about the refuge of
diurnally active animals, and also to confirm the presence
or absence of species in different chronoseres.
Identification of taxa
Irrespective of the sampling technique, animals detected
were caught whenever possible, and identified in hand.
All those that escaped were identified to a justifiable level
or excluded from the analyses. A few individuals of taxonomically problematic species or taxa were preserved for
later identification.
Sampling efficiency
The effectiveness of sampling was evaluated by species
accumulation curves (see Additional file 4), and the effort
adjusted after a mid-fieldwork examination of species
richness data across chronoseres. While all the early succession stages and teak plantations reach an asymptote
very soon, the 30–35 year fallow stopped yielding new
species only by the eighth sampling session, while mature
forest continued to yield new species till the final sampling session.

Pitfall trapping
This technique was used to supplement species inventorying from the belt transects, and for an unbiased measure

Characterization of frog and lizard community succession
Overlap between recovering frog and lizard communities
was measured with the Bray-Curtis measure between all
possible pairs of chronoseres using presence absence data
of all species (see Additional file 4). The resultant dissimilarity matrix was then used to generate a dendrogram
using the UPGMA clustering algorithm [18]. Species turnover in sequential frog vs. lizard communities was
compared using the mean Jaccard's dissimilarity value
between all chronosere pairs calculated from separate
presence absence data for the two groups [36].
Ecological group classification and phylogenetic structure
Life history and behavioural traits were used to group species. These are often called guilds (e.g., [37]), but are
referred to as ecological groups (EGs) here because the
classification covers species from all chronoseres, including those that belonged to separate, non-interacting
communities. The representatives of each EG in a particular community or chronosere on the other hand, can be
considered a guild of that habitat's community. The life
history and behavioural traits used for the EG classification were: diel activity period, habitat use when active,
habitat use when resting, substrate temperature when
active, air temperature when active, relative humidity
when active, substrate moisture when active, resting refuge, resting refuge temperature, resting refuge substrate
moisture and foraging tactic. To validate this data, information from literature and consultations with regional
herpetologists was also used. These data, collected at different measurement scales, were rescaled to discrete categories to which species were allocated as absent or
present. From this binary data, a dissimilarity matrix was
calculated between all species using the Bray-Curtis measure [19]. The dissimilarity matrix was then scaled using
non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). NMDS
geometrically represents dissimilarities in a graphical,
low-dimensional space, and is a robust method to
represent ecological distance [18,19]. See Additional file 4
for the list of species included in the EG classification.

Phylogenetic structure was measured as the ratio of
number of species to the number of genera (S/G ratio) in
each EG. A similar approach has been used in studies
addressing questions about phylogenetic structure in ecological communities [15].
Community – Habitat interrelationships
To test which habitat attributes influenced community
structure, Mantel tests of correspondence between dissimilarity (distance) matrices [18,19,38,39] were used. Dissimilarity matrices between sites were generated based on
differences in set of composite variables (factors)
extracted by the PCA analysis (unsquared Euclidean distances), and for different levels of frog and lizard commu-

nity composition (from entire community to guilds
defined by the EG classification using Jaccard's index)
[18,19]. Significance of correlation coefficients was tested
by 1000 row-column Monte Carlo randomizations for
each pair of matrices.
To test whether the availability of composite variables
(PCA factors) that predicted community and guild structure identified by the matrix correspondence tests did
indeed influence community succession and phylogenetic
structure along gradients of habitat recovery, correlations
between sums of factor scores and species richness, ratio
of species number/guild number and S/G ratios across
chronoseres were tested.

Authors' contributions
SSP conceived the study, carried out the fieldwork, performed the data analyses, and drafted the manuscript.
BCC and GSR participated in design and coordination of
the study. GSR also supervised the vegetation identification and habitat classification. All authors read and
approved the final manuscript.
