Abstract
Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD), a common contagious disease that usually affects children, is normally mild but
can have life-threatening manifestations. It can be caused by enteroviruses, particularly Coxsackieviruses and human
enterovirus 71 (HEV71) with highly variable clinical manifestations. In the spring of 2008, a large, unprecedented HFMD
outbreak in Fuyang city of Anhui province in the central part of southeastern China resulted in a high aggregation of
fatal cases. In this study, epidemiologic and clinical investigations, laboratory testing, and genetic analyses were
performed to identify the causal pathogen of the outbreak. Of the 6,049 cases reported between 1 March and 9 May of
2008, 3023 (50%) were hospitalized, 353 (5.8%) were severe and 22 (0.36%) were fatal. HEV71 was confirmed as the
etiological pathogen of the outbreak. Phylogenetic analyses of entire VP1 capsid protein sequence of 45 Fuyang HEV71
isolates showed that they belong to C4a cluster of the C4 subgenotype. In addition, genetic recombinations were
found in the 3D region (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, a major component of the viral replication complex of the
genome) between the Fuyang HEV71 strain and Coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16), resulting in a recombination virus. In
conclusion, an emerging recombinant HEV71 was responsible for the HFMD outbreak in Fuyang City of China, 2008.
Background
The first HEV71 infection was reported in 1969 in the US
[1]. Although HFMD is usually a mild disease, several
HEV71 outbreaks associated with severe neurological
complications have been reported in Western Pacific
countries or regions, including Malaysia in 1997; Taiwan
in 1998, 2000 and 2001; Australia in 1999; Singapore in
2000; Japan in 1997 and 2000; and Shandong of China in
2007 [2-8].
Human enterovirus 71 (HEV71) is one of the member
in HEV-A species of Enterovius genus in the family Picornaviridae. The genome of HEV71 consists of a single* Correspondence: lidx@chinacdc.cn, wenbo_xu1@yahoo.com.cn

stranded positive-sense RNA of approximately 7400
nucleotides. The viral genome contains a 5'- and 3'untranslated regions (UTRs) which are essential for viral
RNA replication. The genome is translated as a single
large polyprotein that is composed of four capsid proteins, VP1 to VP4, and seven nonstructural proteins, 2A,
2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3C, and 3D. VP1 to VP4 capsid proteins
were encoded by P1 region. The P2 and P3 regions
encode nonstructural proteins and the RNA-dependent
RNA polymerase, 3D, is a major component of the viral
replication complex [9].
Sporadic epidemic or outbreaks of HEV71 infection
had occurred in mainland of China since 1995[8,10,11],
but the highly aggregated cases of rapidly fatal pediatric
infections occurred in the Fuyang HFMD outbreak in
2008 is unprecedented. The identification of the causal
pathogen is crucial for preventing disease spread, reducing fatality rate, and better understanding the pathogenic

mechanism underlying disease severity. This study
reported the investigation and the etiological identification of the Fuyang HFMD outbreak in 2008. And the
genetic recombination event was also found between the
Fuyang HEV71 isolates and CV-A16.

Results
Cases and epidemiology

This study focused on the outbreak between 1 March and
9 May, 2008. A total of 6,049 HFMD cases were reported
from local healthcare facility in Fuyang city (Figure 1), of
which 3,023 (50%) were hospitalized, 353 (6%) were
severe and 22 (0.4%) were fatal. The incidence rate was
70/100,000; while the fatality rate was 0.4%. The gender
ratio of the epidemics was 1.9:1, with 3,938 male and
2,111 female cases. The age ranged from 28 days to 18
years, with 78% of the cases < 3 years old. All of the 22
fatal cases were < 3 years old, and the youngest was 3
months.
Case definitions

The mild HFMD outpatients were defined as patients
with fever and vesicular lesions on their palms, feet and
mouth. Severe cases usually presented with neurologic
complications, which were defined as having two of fol-

lowing clinical manifestations: brainstem encephalitis or
aseptic meningitis; continuous high fever (temperature of
at least 38°C); weakness, vomiting, irritability, myoclonus
and acute flaccid paralysis; pulmonary edema or hemorrhage, heart and lung failure. Encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, pulmonary edema, pulmonary hemorrhage, acute
flaccid paralysis, myocarditis were characterized by the
same definition as described previously [2].
Clinical description

General clinical symptoms of the Fuyang HFMD outbreak included rash, fever, general malaise, cough, vomiting and neurologic complications (such as encephalitis,
aseptic meningitis, or acute flaccid paralysis). The analysis of the clinical characteristics of 15 out of 22 fatal cases
showed that these cases had an acute onset of fever, sore
throat, and myalgia (influenza-like illness) without
catarrhal syndrome, but the rash was rare. The conditions
of most of cases subsequently deteriorated, in which the
patients developed tachypnea, cyanosis, and some presented seizures with white or pink foaming at the mouth
(Table 1). Most hospitalized cases were initially diagnosed as severe pneumonia, some patients died within 15 days after onset.

Laboratory identification of the etiologic pathogen of the
outbreak

Since most of fatal or severe cases were characterized as
respiratory disease syndrome, direct RT-PCR were performed on a total of 89 specimens (including blood sera,
throat swabs and autopsy tissue samples) collected from
fatal and severe cases to detect for seasonal influenza,
avian influenza A/H5N1, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), RSV, Adeno virus, and other respiratory
bacteria microorganism, and all the results were negative.
As enterovirus infection could also induce the respiratory
symptoms, the specimens were also tested using primers
for pan-enterovirus, HEV71, CV-A16 and Echovirus.
Positive results were obtained only for pan-enterovirus
and HEV71. Further investigation using sequence determination and BLAST sequence analysis revealed that all
of the sequences had high homology (95.1%) with HEV71
(strain
E2004104-TW-CDC,
accession
number
EF373576). To further confirm the possible etiological
pathogen, additional 121 more clinical specimens were
collected for the detection of HEV71 and CV-A16 using
direct RT-PCR.
Thus, a total of 210 specimens collected from 13 fatal
cases, 99 severe cases and 39 mild cases, respectively, had
been tested for HEV71 and CV-A16 using direct RTPCR. Six (46%) of 13 fatal cases, 36 (36%) of 99 severe
cases, 17 (44%) of 39 mild cases were positive for HEV71
(Table 2). None were positive for CV-A16 infection. Gene
sequencing studies of HEV71 showed that sequences
from fatal, severe and mild cases exhibited high homology.
All of the 210 specimens were separately cultured in RD
and HEp-2 cell lines. A total of 50 enterovirus isolates
were obtained from clinical specimens: 34 of 132 (26%)
throat swabs, 7 of 12 (58%) stool samples, 3 of 4 (75%)
vesicular fluid, 3 of 22 (14%) anus swab, 1 of 2 (50%) antemortem oral efflux, and 2 of 23 (9%) autopsy lung tissue.

No virus was isolated from CSF and other autopsy tissue
samples. By RT-PCR and sequence determination, 45/50
(90%) of the enteroviruses were identified as HEV71. In
addition, 2 Echovirus 9 (E9), 1 Coxsackievirus A4 (CVA4), 1 Coxackievirus A9 (CV-A9) and 1 Coxackievirus B3
(CV-B3) were isolated and identified. No CV-A16 virus
was found.
Taken together, the results showed that HEV71 was
associated with the Fuyang HFMD outbreak in 2008.
Phylogenetic analysis of entire VP1 region of HEV71

The entire VP1 sequences of 45 HEV71 isolates from 6
fatal cases, 26 severe cases and 13 mild outpatients were
used for phylogenetic analysis(data now shown). The
nucleotide and the amino acid homologies among the
Fuyang isolates were 96.4%-100% and 98.7%-100%,
respectively. The average nucleotide homologies within
fatal, severe and mild cases were 99.3%, 99.7% and 98.9%,
respectively. Based on the VP1 gene, the nucleotide and
amino acid homology between fatal or severe cases and
mild cases were 96.4%-100% and 98.7%-100%, respectively. No significant nucleotide and amino acid differences in the VP1 region were found between severe or
fatal cases and mild cases.
To determine the molecular epidemiology of the Fuyang HEV71 isolates, a phylogenetic dendrogram was constructed with 14 representative Fuyang HEV71 isolates
(which were selected based on the case classification and
their nucleotide divergence: 4 fatal cases, 8 severe cases, 2
mild cases), 43 HEV71 strains available in the GenBank
isolated from 12 provinces in mainland of China between
1997-2008, and 18 international HEV71 strains that represented all 11 known genotypes or subgenotypes (A, B1B5, C1-C5), and 2 HEV71 strains from 2 fatal French
cases of 2007-2008 (Table 3, Figure. 2). It showed that the
Fuyang HEV71 isolates belonged to cluster C4a of the
subgenotype C4, which was similar to the HEV71

sequences isolated from the mainland of China during
2003-2008 (including the sequences from Shandong
Province in 2007 Linyi HFMD outbreak(Zhang, 2009
#233)).
The average nucleotide homology between Fuyang isolates in this study and those isolated from other provinces
in China in 2008, and between Fuyang isolates in this
study and the representative sequences from Shandong
Province in 2007 Linyi HFMD outbreak were 98.5% and
97.1%, respectively.
Identification of recombination between HEV71 and CVA16

The phylogenetic analysis for 3D region revealed that the
sequences of representative isolates from 4 fatal cases, 3
severe cases and 1 mild case shared 77.7%-78.1% and
92.0%-92.2% identities in nucleotides and amino acids,
respectively, with the HEV71 prototype strain BrCr; while
they shared 84.6-85.0% and 97.4-97.6% identities in
nucleotides and amino acids, respectively, with the CVA16 prototype strain G-10. The phylogenetic tree of the
3D gene showed that the 8 sequences were clustered into
the same group and were closer to strain G-10 than to
strain BrCr (Figure 3A).
In order to identify the possible recombination events,
one of the Fuyang representative strain of HEV71: EV71/
Fuyang.Anhui.CHN/17.08/1 was sequenced for the entire
genome, and similarity plot and bootscan analysis were
used to study the relationship of the Fuyang representative strain of HEV71 to the prototype strains of CV-A16
and HEV71, and genotype B representative strain of
HEV71 (Figure 3B). In the analysis, the sequence of the
entire genome of the Fuyang strain was used as the query
sequence and compared to the sequences of the CV-A16
prototype strain G-10, the HEV71 prototype strain BrCr
and B genotype representative strain: MS/7423/87. The
results showed that the P1 region of the Fuyang strain had
the highest degree of similarity to the sequence of BrCr,
and its P2 region and 3A, 3B, 3C region exhibited the

highest degree of similarity to the sequence of G-10 and
MS/7423/87, while 3D region showed the highest degree
of similarity to the sequence of G-10, which suggested
that the Fuyang strain might be a recombinant virus with
CV-A16 in 3D region.

Discussion
The diagnosis of virological etiology is critical and challenging at the beginning of the HFMD outbreak. During
the Fuyang 2008 outbreak, because the clinical symptoms
of HFMD showed atypical manifestations, which was different from common cutaneous lesions, local doctors
misdiagnosed HFMD as pneumonia. In addition, the
identification of HEV71 infection was hampered by the
sudden death of 22 children within 5 days of pulmonary
edema or hemorrhage, heart and lung failure. RT-PCR
and sequencing were primarily performed to identify the
virological etiology of the outbreak. Laboratory testing
showed that 39% of the cases were confirmed as HEV71
infection. Together with clinical manifestations and epidemiological data, we concluded that HEV71 was identified as the major etiological pathogen of the Fuyang
HFMD outbreak.
In the Fuyang HFMD outbreak, diseases were manifested with cutaneous lesions in mild cases and CNS
symptoms in fatal or severe cases. The findings were consistent with studies of the 1997 outbreak in Malaysia and
the 1998 outbreak in Taiwan, in which manifestations of
HEV71 infections predominate with neurological complications in fatal or severe cases[2,3]. Analyses of the VP1
sequence showed high homology between severe or fatal
cases and mild HFMD cases and no significant nucleotide
differences were found. Other groups have also studied
the complete genome of HEV71 isolated from fatal and
non-fatal HFMD cases and found no genetic differences
that could be correlated with the severity of clinical manifestation[12,13]. Studies on the pathogenic mechanism
for HEV71 have pointed to altered innate immunity. An

Figure 2 Phylogenetic dendrogram were drawn on the basis of the 891-nt sequence of entire VP1 gene using the Neighbor-Joining method of MEGA software (version 4.0) for 14 selected Fuyang representative isolates and other HEV71 strains of known subgenotypes listed
in Table 1. The bootstrap values from 1000 pseudoreplicates for major lineages within the tree are shown as percentages. The prototype CVA16 strain
(G-10) was used as outgroup. Solid diamond indicated the fatal cases; Solid triangle indicated the severe cases; Solid round indicated the outpatients;

epidemiologic study during the same outbreak implicated
treatment of initial fever of HEV71 infections with glucocorticoids, which block the innate immune response, as
contributing to the high rate of severe disease[14]. Experimental animal and clinical studies also support this finding indicating that weakened innate immunity is
associated with severe disease and death from HEV71
infection[15-17]. This in combination with introduction
of the new recombinant virus may help to explain the
increased severity of the Fuyang outbreak.
In this study, genetic recombination event were found
between the Fuyang HEV71 isolates, including both fatal
cases and non-fatal cases, and CV-A16, which was similar
to other studies[18,19]. For enteroviruses[20] and dengue
viruses[21], genetic recombination is a well-known phe-

nomenon and recombination could result in the emergence of viruses with altered pathogenic potentials.
Except for the Fuyang HEV71 isolates, genetic recombination was also found in the HEV71 viruses, circulated in
mainland of China during 1998-2008. However, it was
very difficult to clarify the time of recombination and the
role of the HEV71 recombinant in HFMD outbreaks
remains unclear.
Previous studies showed that all known HEV71 strains
could be divided into three distinct genogroups (A, B, C)
and 10 subgenogroups (A, B1-5, C1-4) based on VP1
gene sequences; the subgenotype C4 could be further
divided into C4a and C4b clusters[8]. Based on the phylogenetic analyses, Fuyang isolates belonged to C4a cluster
of the subgenotype C4 and showed high homology with

the isolates circulating in other provinces of the mainland
of China between 2007 and 2008, including those from
the HFMD outbreak in Linyi city in Shandong province in
2007[8]. The C4 subgenotype of HEV71 was initially
identified in Guangdong province in 1998 and has been
continuously circulating for at least 10 years[10], which
may reflect the pattern of endemic circulation of subgenotype C4 viruses. Interestingly, C4b viruses were the
predominant circulating strain in mainland of China
prior to 2004. Since then, however, C4a viruses have
become the predominant strains, which have been continuously circulating and causing epidemic in the mainland of China so far [8].
The subgenotype C4 HEV71 also circulated in neighboring countries and regions, such as, in chronological
order, Taiwan, Japan, Vietnam and Thailand[8]; other
subgenogroups including B2, B4, B5, C1, C2 co-circulated
with C4 between 1990 and 2008[5,7,22]. Interestingly, the
subgenotype C4 was the only subgenotype found in
China since 1998.
A total of 489,073 HFMD cases, including 126 fatal
cases, were reported in China in 2008 (data source:
NNDRS). Recombinant HEV71 infection may become
more serious public health threat for children under the
age of 5 in China, because little is known about the genetics and transmission trend of this fasting mutating virus.
To tackle the increasing threat, there is an urgent need for
establishing an effective HEV71 surveillance system in
China and isolating more viruses, so a complete genetic
baseline could be set up for the entire country.

Conclusion
This study reported the identification of the etiological
pathogen of the HFMD ourtbreak in Fuyang city of
China, 2008. HEV71 was confirmed to associate with the
outbreak. Phylogenetic analyses of entire VP1 capsid protein sequence of 45 Fuyang HEV71 isolates showed that
they belong to C4a cluster of the C4 subgenotype. In
addition, genetic recombinations were found in the 3D
region between the Fuyang HEV71 strain and Coxsackie-

virus A16 (CV-A16), resulting in a recombination virus.
In conclusion, an emerging recombinant HEV71 was
responsible for the HFMD outbreak in Fuyang City of
China, 2008.

Methods
Outbreak investigation

Fuyang city, in the northwest of Anhui Province of China,
has 9.76 million inhabitants and a high population density (1,000 per square km). All the cases were reported
from local healthcare facility of Fuyang city everyday to
National Notifiable Disease Report System (NNDRS) of
Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention
(CCDC). And the number of cases and the incidence
rates were taken directly from the reports in the NNDRS
in China.
Clinical specimens and identification

Based on the clinical presentations and case definition,
the clinical specimens were collected from fatal cases,
severe cases and mild cases individually. From March 1 to
May 9, 49 specimens were available from 13 fatal cases,
including antemortem specimens (throat swabs, serum,
oral efflux), autopsy tissues, lung aspirates, CSF; 122
specimens were collected from 99 severe cases, including
throat swabs, stool, and vesicular fluid; 39 throat swabs
were from 39 mild outpatients. All patients (or the guardians of the children patients or relatives of fatal or comatose patients) gave oral informed consent. Direct reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was
performed using different sets of primers for panenteroviruses[23]; HEV71[8] and CV-A16[8]. Human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) and human laryngeal carcinoma
(HEp-2) cell lines were used to isolate viruses from clinical specimens. Cultures that exhibited a characteristic
enterovirus cytopathic effect were evaluated by RT-PCR
and sequencing.
Sequence determination of the entire VP1 and 3D gene

The entire VP1 and 3D gene of the HEV71 isolates from
this outbreak were amplified by RT-PCR with in-house

(nucleotides 5653-5672, relative to strain HEV71/BrCr),
and HEV71-28A: 5'-GCTATTCTGGTTATAACAAA-3'
(nucleotides 7403-7422, relative to strain HEV71/BrCr)].
The RT-PCR reactions were performed using an Access
RT-PCR Kit (Promega, USA). The PCR products were
purified using a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen),
and the amplicons were directly sequenced from double
direction using an ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer
(Applied Biosystems, Hitachi, Japan).
Nucleotide sequence accession numbers

The entire VP1 sequences of 28 representative Fuyang
isolates in this study were deposited in the GenBank database under the accession numbers: EU703812-EU703814,

GQ121417-GQ121441 (Table 1). And 3D nucleotide
sequences of 8 Fuyang isolates were deposited in the
GenBank database under the accession numbers:
EU703812-EU703814; GQ175176-GQ175180.
Phylogenetic analysis

Alignment of the entire VP1 and 3D nucleotide
sequences of the HEV71 isolates was performed using
BioEdit software v5.0.9 (Tom Hall, North Carolina State
University, Carolina, USA)[24]. A phylogenetic dendrogram was constructed using MEGA v4.0 program (Sudhir
Kumar, Arizona State University, Arizona, USA) [25].
Similarity plot and bootscan analyses for the recombination studies were performed with SimPlot version
3.2[24,26].
