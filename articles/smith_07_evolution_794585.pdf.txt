Abstract
Background: Transcription factors regulate gene expression by interacting with their specific DNA binding sites. Some
transcription factors, particularly those involved in transcription initiation, always bind close to transcription start sites
(TSS). Others have no such preference and are functional on sites even tens of thousands of base pairs (bp) away from
the TSS.
The Cyclic-AMP response element (CRE) binding protein (CREB) binds preferentially to a palindromic sequence
(TGACGTCA), known as the canonical CRE, and also to other CRE variants. CREB can activate transcription at CREs
thousands of bp away from the TSS, but in mammals CREs are found far more frequently within 1 to 150 bp upstream
of the TSS than in any other region. This property is termed positional bias.
The strength of CREB binding to DNA is dependent on the sequence of the CRE motif. The central CpG dinucleotide
in the canonical CRE (TGACGTCA) is critical for strong binding of CREB dimers. Methylation of the cytosine in the CpG
can inhibit binding of CREB. Deamination of the methylated cytosines causes a C to T transition, resulting in a functional,
but lower affinity CRE variant, TGATGTCA.
Results: We performed genome-wide surveys of CREs in a number of species (from worm to human) and showed that
only vertebrates exhibited a CRE positional bias. We performed pair-wise comparisons of human CREs with orthologous
sequences in mouse, rat and dog genomes and found that canonical and TGATGTCA variant CREs are highly conserved
in mammals. However, when orthologous sequences differ, canonical CREs in human are most frequently TGATGTCA
in the other species and vice-versa. We have identified 207 human CREs showing such differences.
Conclusion: Our data suggest that the positional bias of CREs likely evolved after the separation of urochordata and
vertebrata. Although many canonical CREs are conserved among mammals, there are a number of orthologous genes
that have canonical CREs in one species but the TGATGTCA variant in another. These differences are likely due to
deamination of the methylated cytosines in the CpG and may contribute to differential transcriptional regulation among
orthologous genes.

Background
Identification of transcription factor binding sites is crucial to the understanding of gene regulation at the transcriptional level and for deciphering gene regulatory
networks. In recent years, the power of bioinformatics and
the emergence of complete genome sequences from a variety of species have made it possible to perform global in
silico surveys for putative binding sites of individual transcription factors.
The Cyclic-AMP response element binding protein
(CREB) belongs to the bZip family of transcription factors
that contain basic leucine zipper motifs. CREB activates
target genes by binding to the cAMP-response element
(CRE) most frequently located in the promoter region [1].
Examples of bZip proteins binding to CRE and CRE-like
motifs have been described in eukaryotes from yeast to
human [1,2]. In mammals, CREB plays an important role
in many biological processes [1] and can be activated
through several signaling pathways (see reviews: [1,3]).
For instance, CREB has been implicated in multiple functions essential to the brain, including responses to emotional stimuli [4], learning and long-term memory
formation [5-9]. Dysfunction in CREB-regulated transcription also contributes to neurodegeneration [10-12].
The canonical CRE is a palindromic octamer, TGACGTCA.
However, degenerate CREs and half-CREs (TGACG) are
also found to be functional in many of the CREB targets
identified so far [1], suggesting a tolerance of CREB for
CREs in terms of sequence recognition and binding. More
than 100 mammalian CREB target genes have been identified to date (reviewed in [1,13]), and there are thousands of putative CREB binding sites that are likely to be
functional [14,15].
It has been observed that, in mammalian genomes, the
canonical CRE shows a positional bias [16] towards the
proximal promoter region [15,17], although it remains
unclear how this feature has evolved. Mammalian
genomes, as is typical of vertebrate genomes, are globally
methylated [18] and contain many CpG islands [19,20].
CpG islands are 200 bp or longer DNA regions with GCcontent greater than 50% and a higher than expected
number of CpG dinucleotides [21]. Approximately 60
percent of human genes (including most, if not all, housekeeping genes) have CpG islands in their promoters [22].
Most CpG dinucleotides in mammalian genomes contain
5-methylcytosine [22]. However, although CpG dinucleotides in CpG islands can be methylated, they are typically
maintained in an unmethylated state [22]. CpGs are usually methylated on both complementary strands, but are
sometimes maintained in a hemi-methylated state [23].
The central dinucleotide of the canonical CRE motif, CpG,
is known to be methylated in some cases [14]. Such methylation inhibits CREB binding [14] and presumably also

increases the rate of C to T transition due to spontaneous
deamination of methyl-C. These transitions are often not
corrected by DNA repair mechanisms and can be retained
as single nucleotide polymorphisms that may cause
altered gene expression and changes in phenotype. These
transitions may persist through evolution, potentially
resulting in differences in CRE function in orthologous
genes. CREs with a central TpG (or CpA) have lower affinity for CREB binding compared to the canonical CRE
[24,25], but have been shown to be functional in some
genes [25-29]. Deamination of both complements of a
fully methylated CpG dinucleotide results in a change
from CpG to TpA. The TGATATCA motif is not known to
function as a CRE.
In this study, we performed genome-wide searches for the
canonical CRE and a variant CRE motif (TGATGTCA,
called the TG-variant in this work) in promoter regions of
human, mouse, rat, dog, chicken, fish, frog, fruit fly, sea
squirt and worm, to determine if the positional bias of
CREs is present in other genomes and to establish the
point in evolutionary history that the positional bias of
CREs started to appear. We also performed comparative
genomics analyses to investigate the conservation of
orthologous CRE motifs in human, mouse, rat and dog.
We focused on differences in the central dinucleotide of
the CRE motifs, which is critical for strong CREB binding.
Since, in mammals, methylation of sites other than the
CpG dinucleotides is rare, TG-variant CREs are not
expected to be affected by methylation mechanisms.
Using pairwise comparisons of human CREs with orthologous sequences in mouse, rat and dog, we identified
known and putative CREs that show CpG to TpG transitions in the core of the CRE motif between orthologous
genes. Such differences between CREs in the promoter
regions of orthologous genes may cause significant differences in temporal or tissue specific expression in these
orthologs.

Results and Discussion
Positional bias of CRE-like motifs
We performed a search of the literature to obtain information on the sequence of CREs in known CREB target genes.
A total of 110 CREs in 93 known CREB target genes were
retrieved. Although in some cases sequences longer than
the 8 bp core motif were reported, only the core motifs
were considered in this study. A total of 46 distinct CRE
variants were identified. We searched a set of genomic
sequences containing more than 46,000 human
sequences spanning -1,000 bp to +1,000 bp with respect
to the TSS, defined as "TSS spanning regions" (TSS-SRs)
(see methods). The searches were performed on both the
forward and reverse strands with respect to the direction
of transcription. Using these sequences we computed representation index (RI) values in 40 × 50 bp windows

along the TSS-SRs (see methods) for the 46 reported CRE
variants and a non-CRE motif TGATATCA (TA-motif). The
canonical CRE motif was highly over-represented in 3
adjacent 50 bp windows over the -1 to -150 bp region
(mean RI(-1 to -150) 8.7), but under-represented outside this
region (mean RI(outside -1 to -150) 0.8). The difference
between these two mean RI values was used as a measure
of positional bias towards the region from -1 to -150 bp.
Positional bias values of all 47 motifs were computed and
motifs with positional bias values greater than 2.6 standard deviations from the mean (P < 0.01) were classified as
significant. Figure 1 shows the representation index (RI)
profiles of 5 CRE motifs with the highest positional bias
values and the non-CRE TA-motif. The canonical CRE and
the TG-variant (TGATGTCA) showed the highest positional bias (values 7.9 and 3.8, respectively) and were the
only motifs to have significant positional bias. When considered separately, TG-variant motifs on the forward and
reverse strand (with respect to the direction of transcription) were found to have similar positional bias values
(data not shown). We selected the canonical CRE and the
TG-variant to investigate the evolution of positional bias
of CREs.

regions. Plots of normalized RI values of the canonical
CRE versus distance from the TSS revealed a strong positional bias toward the TSS in the genomes of human (H.
Sapiens), mouse (M. musculus), rat (R. norvegicus), chicken
(G. gallus), frog (X. tropicalis) and zebrafish (D. rerio) (Figure 2A,B) but not in the genomes of the sea squirt (C.
intestinalis), fruit fly (D. melanogaster) and worm (C. elegans) (Figure 2C). Positional bias was also observed for
the TG-variant in human, mouse, and rat (Figure 2D). Little or no positional bias was observed for the TG-variant
in chicken, frog and zebrafish (Figure 2E) and no positional bias was seen in the sea squirt, fruit fly and worm
(Figure 2F). The CRE positional bias likely evolved after
the separation of urochordata and vertebrata.
It would seem that selective conservation of canonical
CREs located close to the TSS occurred during evolution.
It is known that activated CREB is involved in the recruitment of other transcriptional co-activators, such as CREB
binding protein, to promoter regions close to the TSS to
facilitate transcription [30]. We postulate that this requirement for CREB to be in close proximity to the TSS might
have imposed functional constraints on the location of
the CRE and contributed to the evolution of CRE positional bias. We hypothesize that the positional bias of the
TG-variant motif is a consequence of CpG to TpG transitions in canonical CREs due to cytosine methylationdeamination events. We explore this hypothesis in the following sections.

Evolution of the positional bias of the canonical CRE
Since CREs have been described in a broad range of
eukaryotes, we performed bi-directional searches for
canonical and TG-variant CREs in the genomes of 9 organisms to see if the CRE positional bias is conserved. We
computed RI values in 50 bp windows in the TSS-SR

In order to be comparable on the same scale, we normalised the RI values in each 50 bp by dividing them by the sum of all RI values in the 40 windows over the TSS-SRs. The values presented are percentages.

Conservation of CREs in mammalian genomes
Using pair-wise comparisons, putative CREs from our survey in the human genome were checked for conservation
of the motif sequence in mouse, rat and dog using the
"LiftOver" tool [31,32]. Over 11,000 human CREs were
mapped to orthologous sequences in mouse, rat or dog.
The frequency of identical orthologous sequences found
in mouse, rat or dog was used as a measure of conservation of the CRE motif variants. Table 1 shows the five most
highly conserved CRE motifs between human and the
other mammals. The canonical CRE had the highest motif
conservation value (mean 57.0 ± 0.3%) and the TG-variant was the second most conserved (mean 33.5 ± 1.0%).
Using the pair-wise comparisons of human canonical and
TG-variant CREs with orthologous sequences in mouse,
rat and dog, we investigated the frequency of occurrence
of all possible octet motifs. Table 2 shows the five most
frequently occurring motif pairs for human canonical and
TG-variant CREs. We found that when human canonical
CREs are not conserved in the other species they are most
frequently the TG-variant (4.3 ± 0.3%) or its reverse complement, TGACATCA (CA-variant, 3.6 ± 0.8%) (Table 2).
This is not surprising since, due to the high frequency of
deamination of methylated cytosines in CpG dinucle-

otides to thymidine, CpG to TpG or CpA transitions are
the most frequent DNA mutation in mammals [33]. Interestingly, the TA-motif, which can result from doubledeamination of methylated CpG, was rare (0.2 ± 0.1%).
Human TG-variants are most frequently found in the
canonical form in the other mammals when they are not
conserved (Table 2). Interestingly, for human TG-variant
CREs, the third most frequent motif pair was the reverse
complement, CA-variant CRE. Such differences may occur
when the central CpG of an ancestral canonical CRE is
methylated and deaminated on different strands during
divergent evolution. In fact we identified 7 cases where
canonical, TG-variant and CA-variant CREs are found in
orthologous sequences in human, mouse, rat and dog.
One of these was located 305 bp upstream of the TSS of
human CALCA, a known CREB target gene. This CRE was
canonical in human and rat, TG-variant in mouse and CAvariant in dog. The fourth most frequent motif pair in
human TG-variant CREs was the non-functional TAmotif. These motif pairs could have been generated from
an ancestral canonical CRE that was methyl-CpG deaminated on only one strand in human, but on both strands
in the other species. Taken together these data show that
both canonical and TG-variant CREs are highly conserved

among mammals and that mutations involving CpG to
TpG transitions are the most commonly occurring differences found in orthologous CREs.
CRE methylation and CpG islands
Many mammalian promoters contain CpG islands, which
are regions of high CpG density and hypomethylation. In
order to investigate the frequency that CRE variants occur
within CpG islands, we mapped the positions of human
canonical and TG-variant CREs and the TA-motif onto the
human CpG island track using the UCSC table browser
data retrieval tool [34].

We found that 62% of human canonical CREs, but only
7% of TG-variant CREs and 2% of TA-motifs, were found
in CpG islands. We looked at a subset of the canonical and
TG-variant CREs that are conserved in at least one other
mammal (mouse, rat or dog) and found that 81% of
canonical, but only 13% of TG-variant CREs are located in
CpG islands in human. Therefore, the CREs within the
CpG islands appear to be more conserved. Since CpG
islands are less methylated than other genomic DNA
regions, CpG dinucleotides in CpG islands are less prone
to spontaneous methyl-C deamination. This in turn may
reduce the rate of mutation of canonical CREs in CpG

islands to the TG- or CA-variants, or to the TA-motif. CREs
that are outside of CpG islands are not protected from
methylation and many of these may have been subject to
deamination during evolution. We also found that the
positional bias was stronger for both canonical and TGvariant CREs in CpG islands versus those not in CpG
islands (data not shown).
To address the question of whether the rate of CpG to TpG
transitions is different for CREs within or outside of the
CpG islands, we analyzed the CpG island status of four
subsets of human and mouse orthologous CREs: (1) CREs
that were canonical in both human and mouse (CG:CG);
(2) CREs that were TG-variants in both human and mouse
(TG:TG); (3) CREs that were canonical in human, but TGvariants in mouse (CG:TG); and (4) CREs that were TGvariants in human, but canonical in mouse (TG:CG) (see
Table 3). These sets were then partitioned according to
whether the CRE pairs were or were not in a CpG island in
human. We found that 80% of the CG:CG CRE pairs, but
only 16% of TG:TG CRE pairs were in CpG islands in
human. This is consistent with our findings above (see
'conservation of CREs in mammalian genomes'). Sixty
percent of the CG:TG pairs and 32% of the TG:CG pairs
were found in CpG islands. According to these results,

when human canonical CREs are located outside a CpG
island, they are twice as likely to be paired with TG-variants (CG:TG) than with canonical CREs (CG:CG) in
mouse (40% and 20%, respectively). Similarly, the percentage of TG:CG pairs in human CpG islands is almost
double the percentage of TG:TG pairs (32% and 17%,
respectively). We also found that 80% of human canonical CREs that are conserved in mouse are in a CpG island
in human versus only 57% of those not conserved in
mouse. Taken together these data suggest that although
CpG to TpG transitions within canonical CREs do occur in
CpG island regions, the rates of transition are much
higher when the CREs lie in non-CpG island regions.
Tissue specific methylation of canonical CREs has been
shown to inhibit CREB binding [14] and methylationdependant regulation of CREB activity has been demonstrated [35-38]. Most variants of the canonical CRE contain the motif TGACG, which are considered to be halfsite CREs [1], and can also be methylated at the CpG. Such
regulation, however, is not likely to function on TG-variant CREs since they lack the CpG dinucleotide that is the
usual target of DNA methyltransferases in mammals. It
has been established that TG-variant CREs are functional
in a number of mammalian genes including PLAT, Cga,
RARA, RARB, NTS and CFTR [25-29], but they may have
lower specificity for CRE-binding proteins than canonical
CREs [25]. Thus, a gene that is regulated by a canonical
CRE in one species and a TG-variant in another species
may show differences in basal, temporal or tissue specific
gene expression. From the pair-wise comparisons of
human CREs to orthologous sequences in other mammals
we identified 99 human canonical CREs that were TG-variant CREs in at least one other species and 108 human TGvariant CREs that were canonical CREs in at least one
other species (See Additional File 1). Further investigation
is required to establish whether these putative CREs contribute to differences in gene expression that are relevant
to human development or disease.
The appearance of heavily methylated genomes and CpG
islands both coincide with the evolution of vertebrates
[18,22]. CpG islands tend to associate with the 5'-end of

genes, often spanning proximal promoter regions [22].
The urochordate, Ciona intestalis, has a fractionally methylated genome and shows examples of sequence resembling vertebrate CpG islands [39], which may hint at the
beginning of the evolution of the CpG islands seen in vertebrates. We found that, unlike all the other chordates in
our study, Ciona has no positional bias of the canonical
CRE, suggesting that the positional bias of CREs evolved
after the separation of vertebrates from the other chordates. Antequera [22] proposed a model for CpG island
evolution in vertebrates that involves protection of CpG
island regions from DNA methylation by the initial
assembly of the replication machinery. Since vertebrate
CpG islands are hypomethylated regions in a sea of CpG
methylation, it follows that the evolution of this feature
was dependent on the evolution of genome-wide methylation. Most of the canonical CREs identified in this study
were found to be located within CpG islands. We propose
that, in addition to the selective pressure for CREs to be in
close proximity to the TSS, the evolution of positional bias
of canonical CREs was also assisted by the maintenance of
CpG islands in a hypomethylated state in vertebrates.
CREs that lie outside of the boundaries of CpG islands are
more likely to be methylated and are vulnerable to
methyl-cytosine deamination to thymidine. Our finding
that most TG-variant CREs, which can be formed by CpG
to TpG transition in canonical CREs, were found outside
CpG islands supports this hypothesis.
We speculate that early vertebrates had many more canonical CRE motifs distributed throughout the genome than
today's vertebrates and that genome-wide methylation
and deamination of methyl-CpG has removed many of
these motifs from vertebrate genomes. A whole genome
survey showed that the human genome contains only
25% of the expected number of canonical CRE motifs
(data not shown). CpG islands may have preserved CREs
(especially canonical CREs) as functional transcription
factor binding sites in regions close to the core promoter.
The result of this process is the observed positional bias of
the canonical CRE. CpG islands however are not necessarily stable over time. There is evidence to suggest that
mouse CpG islands have eroded [40]. Evolutionary

changes in the CpG island status of genes could leave
canonical CREs exposed to methylation and trigger conversion to the TG-variant. Also, CpG islands are not
devoid of methylation. Canonical CREs in CpG islands
can still be methylated, in some cases in a tissue dependent or temporal manner. In fact, we found that 12 out of
26 canonical CREs recently identified as always methylated or differentially methylated [14] were located in CpG
islands. We further speculate that the weaker positional
bias observed in the TG-variant is simply a consequence of
deamination of methyl-C in the core of the canonical
CREs.

Conclusion
In summary, our data suggest that a positional bias of
canonical CREs towards the TSS evolved in vertebrates
after the separation from urochordates. The weaker positional bias observed in the TG-variant is likely a consequence of deamination of methyl-C in the core of the
canonical CREs. The canonical CRE is the most highly
conserved CRE variant in mammals and shows the strongest positional bias toward the TSS. The most frequent
mutations in canonical CREs are likely due to methyl-C
deamination events. We observed that most canonical
CREs lay within CpG islands where they are likely maintained in an un-methylated state, thus protecting them
from methyl-C deamination. Conversely, TG-variant
CREs were generally found in non-CpG island regions.
Many of these TG-variant CREs may have been formed
from canonical CREs through methyl-C deamination.
Our discovery of orthologous CREs with different
dynamic methylation potential amongst mammals may
help to uncover important differences in the regulation of

orthologous CREB target genes relevant to human development and disease. In future work we would like to
extend our study to other transcription factors that show
positional bias and bind to sites with methylation-sensitive CpG dinucleotides.

Methods
Sources of the sequences
The sequence spanning -1,000 bp to +1,000 bp with
respect to the TSS, defined as "TSS spanning region" (TSSSR), was chosen for analysis in this study. For the study of
CpG → TpG transitions in orthologous genes a comprehensive search for CREs was first performed in human on
both strands of the TSS-SRs. Since genes are frequently
represented by multiple sequences with different TSSs, a
database of human TSS-SRs was generated comprising all
sequences with a defined TSS from H-inv [41], RefSeq
[42] and the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC, [43]).
The sequences were obtained from the UCSC genome
database by means of the table browser data retrieval tool
[34] using UCSC genome version hg17. Only sequences
with unique TSS positions that are different from the
genomic positions of the start codon of corresponding
genes were considered. In this dataset, many genes are represented by multiple TSS-SRs due to the presence of alternate TSSs in the source databases. The numbers of
sequences obtained from each source and those in the
final dataset are summarized in Table 4.

Sequences from 9 species, Homo sapiens, Mus musculus,
Rattus norvegicus, Gallus gallus, Xenopus tropicalis, Danio
rerio, Ciona intestinalis, Drosophila melanogaster and
Caenorhabditis elegans, were obtained from the UCSC

Measuring motif positional bias
The representation index (RI) was used to measure representation of a motif in a set of sequences and was defined
as the total number of occurrences of a motif (N) divided
by the statistical expectation value (E) of the motif in a
given set of sequences [44]. Motif expectation values were
calculated using the following formula:

E = p(Mf) × (Sequence Length - n+1) × (number of
sequences)
Where p(Mf) = ∏p(xi) {i = 1, 2, ......, n}, Mf is a motif;
p(Mf) is the motif probability; p(xi) is the probability of
each base in a motif calculated using the average contents
of A, C, G, T respectively in each 50 bp window of the
sequence set; xi is the base at position i; and n is the length
of the motif. In this study, RI values were calculated for
each of the 40 × 50 bp windows along the TSS-SR (-1,000
to +1,000 bp). Motif searches and RI value calculations
were performed using BioMiner, a suite of data mining
tools designed and built in house.
Positional bias in the region from -1 to -150 bp with
respect to the TSS was defined as the difference in mean RI
values between the 3 × 50 bp windows from -1 to -150 bp
and the other 37 × 50 bp windows. The positional bias of
a motif was classified as significant if the value was greater
than 2.6 standard deviations (p < 0.01) from the mean of
the positional bias values of all motifs.
Verification of CREs by cross-species sequence comparison
LiftOver [31], a tool at UCSC for conversion of genome
coordinates between assemblies either within a species or
between species, was used to convert the genomic coordinates of all human CREs to mouse, rat and dog coordinates. Sequences at these coordinates were then
interrogated for the presence of a CRE in each target species. The cross-referenced CREs are referred to as orthologous CREs in this study.
