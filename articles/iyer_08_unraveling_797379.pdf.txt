Abstract
Recently Mycobacterium tuberculosis was shown to possess a novel protein modification, in which a
small protein Pup is conjugated to the epsilon-amino groups of lysines in target proteins. Analogous
to ubiquitin modification in eukaryotes, this remarkable modification recruits proteins for
degradation via archaeal-type proteasomes found in mycobacteria and allied actinobacteria. While
a mycobacterial protein named PafA was found to be required for this conjugation reaction, its
biochemical mechanism has not been elucidated. Using sensitive sequence profile comparison
methods we establish that the PafA family proteins are related to the γ-glutamyl-cysteine synthetase
and glutamine synthetase. Hence, we predict that PafA is the Pup ligase, which catalyzes the ATPdependent ligation of the terminal γ-carboxylate of glutamate to lysines, similar to the above
enzymes. We further discovered that an ortholog of the eukaryotic PAC2 (e.g. cg2106) is often
present in the vicinity of the actinobacterial Pup-proteasome gene neighborhoods and is likely to
represent the ancestral proteasomal chaperone. Pup-conjugation is sporadically present outside
the actinobacteria in certain lineages, such as verrucomicrobia, nitrospirae, deltaproteobacteria and
planctomycetes, and in the latter two lineages it might modify membrane proteins.

Introduction
It was recently shown that Mycobacterium tuberculosis contains a small protein, Pup (Rv2111c), that is covalently
conjugated to the ε-NH2 groups of lysines on several target
proteins (pupylation) such as the malonyl CoA acyl carrier protein (FabD) [1]. Mycobacterium, like most other
actinobacteria, also possesses an archaeal-type proteasome that contains an AAA+ ATPase and two distinct NTN
hydrolase-type peptidases [2]. Pupylation of FabD was
shown to result in its recruitment to the mycobacterial
proteasome and subsequent degradation analogous to
eukaryotic ubiquitin-conjugated proteins. This remarka-

ble conjugation reaction was found to be dependent upon
another mycobacterial protein, the proteasome accessory
factor (PafA) [1,3]. Unlike ubiquitin and related ubiquitin-like proteins (UBLs), which are conjugated to target
lysines by means of successive trans-thiolation reactions
involving their C-terminal glycine residue, Pup was
shown to be conjugated via the γ-carboxylate of the terminal glutamate [1-3]. Based on this the discoverers of
pupylation suggested that the conjugation process might
involve a different biochemistry, but did not specify what
this reaction might be [1].

Using sensitive sequence analysis methods we show that
PafA, the protein required for pupylation, belongs to the
glutamine synthetase fold and predict that it is likely to
catalyze an ATP-dependent peptide ligase reaction.

Results and discussion
Phyletic patterns, genome organization and evolutionary
relationships of Pup and PafA
To understand better the pupylation process we investigated both Pup and PafA using sensitive sequence profile
searches with the PSI-BLAST program and HMMer package. Pup was previously detected only in actinobacteria
[1]. Our searches recovered Pup orthologs in all major
actinobacteria lineages including the basal bifidobacteria
and also sporadically in certain other bacterial lineages,
such as nitrospirae, deltaproteobacteria (e.g. Plesiocystis),
planctomycetes (e.g. Rhodopirellula) and the verrucomicrobia-chlamydia clade (e.g. Methylacidiphilum). The Pup
proteins were all between 50–90 residues in length and a
multiple alignment shows that they all contain a conserved motif with a G [EQ] signature at the C-terminus
[Additional file 1]. Thus, all of them are suitable for conjugation via the terminal glutamate or the deamidated
glutamine (as shown in the case of the Mycobacterium Pup
[1]). The conserved globular core of Pup is predicted to
form a bihelical unit with the extreme C-terminal 6–7 residues forming a tail in the extended conformation [Additional file 1]. Thus, Pup is structurally unrelated to the
ubiquitin fold and has convergently evolved the function
of protein modifier. Similar searches with the PafA protein of Mycobacterium showed that it had a phyletic pattern
closely mirroring that of Pup; though in several lineages
there were two paralogs of PafA (Fig. 1A and [Additional
file 1]). PafA homologs (both, if two are present) and Pup
are genomic neighbors in all bacterial lineages, with the
Pup gene invariably being adjacent to one of the PafA
genes (Fig. 1A). With the exception of the deltaproteobacterium Plesiocystis and the planctomycete Rhodopirellula,
genes for the three proteasomal subunits are also associated with this conserved gene neighborhood (Fig. 1A).
This suggests that in most currently available genomes
with these genes there is a strong functional linkage
between Pup, PafA and the archaeal-type proteasome,
recapitulating the experimentally observed situation in M.
tuberculosis [1,3].

PafA was earlier reported as a protein with no relationship
to known protein domains [1,3]. A search with the Saccharopolyspora PafA homolog (SACE_2254; gi: 134098823)
recovered γ-glutamyl-cysteine synthetase-2 (γ-glutamylcysteine ligase-2; GCS2) from Saccharopolyspora with borderline statistical significance (gi:134100361; expectvalue = 0.08). Interestingly, this alignment completely
spanned the GhExE signature (where 'h' is a hydrophobic
residue and 'x' any residue), which is absolutely conserved

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/45

in both PafA and the GCS2 families and forms part of the
Mg2+ and ATP binding active site of the latter enzymes
(Fig. 1B and 2). To further explore the evolutionary affinities of the PafA family we prepared a multiple alignment
and used an HMM derived from this alignment for an
HHpred profile-profile comparison search against a
library of HMMs derived from non-redundant PDB structures as seeds. This search recovered the GCS2 HMM
(based on PDB: 1r8g) as the highly significant best hit (pvalue= 10-5), with an alignment spanning the entire
length of the GCS2 catalytic domain and matching all key
conserved motifs (Fig. 2; see below). Thus, the PafA family
appears to be a member of the glutamine synthetase (GS)
fold to which GCS2 belongs [4,5]. While all known members of the GS fold catalyze ATP-dependent phosphotransfer reactions, they belong to either of two distantly
related superfamilies: 1) The carboxylate-amine/ammonia ligases, which catalyze a two step ligase reaction
involving phosphorylation of a carboxylate group (usually γ-carboxylate of glutamate) followed by ligation of
the amino group of an amino acid (GCS1 and GCS2) or
ammonia (glutamine synthetases) with the formation of
an amide linkage (Fig. 1C) [6]. 2) The guanido kinases,
which phosphorylate the guanido group of arginine or
creatine [7,8]. Given that the GhExE is a distinctive signature only seen in the first superfamily, it became clear that
PafA is a member of the carboxylate-amine/ammonia
ligase superfamily.
To better understand the affinities of the PafA family
within this superfamily and the functional implications of
this relationship we first defined the conserved core
shared by all carboxylate- amine/ammonia ligases using
characterized structures. We generated a structural alignment of the glutamine synthetase, GatB and GatE proteins, which catalyze the in situ synthesis of glutamine or
asparagine on Q-tRNA or N-tRNA charged with glutamate
and aspartate respectively, and two families of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetases (GCS1 and GCS2) using the MUSTANG program. This alignment showed that despite several large family-specific inserts, the entire superfamily
shared 6 conserved strands, typically in a 231465 arrangement, with at least two universally conserved helices
occurring C-terminal to strands 3 and 6, respectively (Fig.
1B). These strands form a saddle-shaped structure with
the active site located on the concave face and the conserved helices packing against the convex face. The structural alignment also revealed that the core strands 1, 2, 3,
4 and 6 contributed key catalytic residues to the active site
in all members of this superfamily. The predicted secondary structure of the PafA family revealed the presence of
equivalents of all conserved strands of this ligase superfamily (Fig. 1B, 2). Further, a comparison of motifs on
equivalent strands showed that (Fig. 1B, 2): 1) the PafA
family contains a GhExE on the core strand-1 which is

equivalent to the Ex [EH] motif present in the first strand
of all characterized superfamily members. 2) PafA shares
with the rest of the superfamily conserved acidic residues
on core strands 2 and 3, which are involved in contacting

Mg2+ and/or ATP. 3) In core strand-4 PafA contains a [HQ]
x [NH] motif that is equivalent to the [HD] x [NH] motif
that is present in all previously characterized members of
this superfamily. This motif is critical for interacting with

Biology Direct 2008, 3:45

both the phosphate on the intermediate and a metal ion
in the active site [6]. 4) In core strand-6 PafA displays a
motif of the form [QH]×4D that corresponds to the motif
Ex [RK]×2D seen in the equivalent strand of other members of the superfamily. The first conserved polar residue
in this motif is located close to the active site metal and
ATP. 5) Additionally, the PafA family shares with all carboxylate- amine/ammonia ligases, excluding the GatB
and GatE families, a conserved arginine in core strand-5
and another arginine in the long loop N-terminal to this
strand (Fig. 1B, 2). These arginines project into the active
site surface and are likely to act as "arginine fingers" [9] in
stabilizing the hyper-charged intermediate during phosphotransfer or participate in binding one of the substrates.
Thus, the PafA family possesses all the features needed to
function as an ATP-dependent carboxylate-amine ligase,
like other members of this superfamily.
Functional and evolutionary implications of PafA as a
carboxylate-amine ligase
The above observation together with the experimental evidence and genomic context strongly imply that PafA is the
Pup ligase, and catalyzes the ligation of the γ-carboxylate
of the terminal glutamate (or glutamine deamidated to
glutamate) of Pup to the ε-NH2 group of a lysine on the
target protein (Fig. 1C). Many enzymes of the carboxylateamine ligase superfamily, including GCS1 and GCS2,
function as dimers. Hence, in light of the frequent presence of two PafA paralogs in most organisms, we propose
that the Pup ligase is typically a heterodimer. However, in
cases like Mycobacterium, with a single PafA gene, it is
likely to be a homodimer. In several actinobacteria (e.g.
Arthrobacter, Streptomyces) this gene neighborhood also
includes two Fkbp-type peptidyl prolyl isomerases and a
DeoR-family transcription factor (Fig. 1A). The former
association suggests that prolyl isomerases might have an
accessory role in pupylation of certain substrates. The
associated DeoR transcription factor might regulate
expression of the pupylation and protein degradation system by sensing a small molecule. Some actinobacterial
Pup-proteasome gene neighbhorhoods contain another
conserved protein typified by Corynebacterium cg2106
(PBD: 2p90), which is also found in archaea, frequently in
the neighborhood of the proteasomal ATPase subunit.
Most bacteria and archaea encode two cg2106 paralogs
and sequence profile searches revealed that they are
orthologs of the eukaryotic chaperone PAC2 required for
proteasome assembly [10]. Cg2106 forms a trimeric torroid, suggesting that it might provide a scaffold for assembly of proteasomal peptidase subunits. As none of the
other eukaryotic proteasomal chaperones have orthologs
in archaea or bacteria, this protein is likely to represent the
ancestral chaperone of the proteasome (Additional file 1).
In both Plesiocystis and Rhodopirellula, we find no linkage
between Pup/Pup ligase and genes for proteasomal subu-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/45

nits; instead they are linked to a gene for a membrane protein (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, these Pup ligases contain a
remarkable insertion of 4 trans-membrane segments
immediately C-terminal to the core strand-4 [Additional
File 1]. Based on available structures of members of the GS
fold these TM helices are predicted to stick out of the core
fold without distorting it and are likely to anchor these
Pup ligases to the cytoplasmic face of the cell membrane.
Hence, in these organisms pupylation of membrane-associated proteins might have a regulatory role.
Given that the best hits for Pup ligases in profile-profile
comparisons is the widely distributed GCS2 family, and
the fact that the γ-glutamyl-cysteine synthetases catalyze a
very similar reaction to pupylation, it is likely that the Pup
ligase emerged in the actinobacterial lineage from a GCS2
precursor. We carried out multiple sequence profile
searches with different starting points of carboxylateamine/ammonia ligase superfamily to identify additional
members. As a result we recovered two more previously
uncharacterized families of these ligases [Additional file
1]. The first of these families is comprised of large proteins
containing an N-terminal transglutaminase-like papain
fold domain fused to a C-terminal domain of the carboxylate-amine/ammonia ligase superfamily (E.g. Mycobacterium tuberculosis Rv2566, gi: 15609703). Proteins of the
second family (E.g. Clostridium perfringens CJD_1902, gi:
182624943) are similarly sized to GCS2 and are found in
conserved gene neighborhoods encoding a glutamine
amidotransferase-like thiol peptidase (in proteobacteria)
or an Aig2-family γ-glutamyl cyclotransferase (in firmicutes) [11]. In neither of these cases small, conserved
ORFs reminiscent of Pup are encoded in their gene neighborhoods. This observation, in conjunction with their
domain fusions and gene-neighborhoods, suggests that
they are likely to mediate peptide formation reactions in
the context of synthesis of glutathione or related peptide
secondary metabolites rather than conjugating proteins.
Hence, pupylation appears to be a rather distinctive reaction, despite the shared biochemistry, that has emerged
from a superfamily that otherwise specializes in cofactor
(glutathione) or amino acid (glutamine) biosynthesis. In
this respect it is reminiscent of the emergence of ubiquitination from precursors likewise involved in cofactor
(molybdopterin and thiamine) and amino acid (cysteine)
biosynthesis [12-14]. Thus, remarkably similarly covalent
protein modifications by peptides or amino acids appear
to have convergently evolved on at least 3 distinct occasions in unrelated folds of enzymes: 1) Ubiquitination in
the Rossmanoid E1 fold and the distinct E2 fold [12]; 2)
Pupylation in the GS fold and 3) Bacterial and eukaryotic
N-end rule arginyl or leucyl ligation in the acetyltransferase fold [15].

Materials and methods
Gene neighborhoods were determined using a custom
script that uses completely sequenced genomes or whole
genome shot gun sequences to derive a table of gene
neighbors centered on a query gene. Then the BLASTCLUST program [16] is used to cluster products across the
neighborhoods and establish conserved co-co-occurring
genes. These conserved gene neighborhoods are then
sorted as per a ranking scheme based on occurrence in at
least one other phylogenetically distinct lineage ("phylum" in NCBI Taxonomy database), complete conservation in a particular lineage ("phylum") and physical
closeness on the chromosome indicating sharing of regulatory -10 and -35 elements. Profile searches were conducted using the PSI-BLAST program with a default profile
inclusion expectation (E) value threshold of 0.01 [17].
Profile-profile comparisons were performed using the
HHpred program [18]. Multiple alignments were constructed using the Kalign program [19] followed by manual adjustments based on structural alignments generated
using MUSTANG [20]. Protein secondary structure was
predicted using a multiple alignment as the input for the
JPRED program [21].

Reviewer's comments
M. Madan Babu, MRC-LMB, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB22QH, United Kingdom
In this manuscript, Lakshminarayan Iyer, Maxwell Burroughs
and L Aravind report an important study that sheds light on the
potential catalytic mechanism of how Pup, a small protein, gets
post-translationally added to substrates. In Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, it was recently shown that PafA was a factor that
was important for such a modification to occur. Though this
was known, the catalytic mechanism of how this is achieved
remains unknown. In this work, using a combination of comparative genomic analysis, sequence and structure comparisons,
the authors reveal that PafA is a distant evolutionary relative of
the gamma-glutamyl-cysteine synthetase/glutamine synthetases. By a systematic comparison of available sequences of
homologs and their structures, they identify critical residues
that are important for function. Using these observations, the
authors predict that PafA is likely to catalyze an ATP dependent
ligation of the gamma-carboxylate of glutamate of Pup to
lysines of the substrates.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/45

They also show that Pup-conjugation is likely to be present sporadically outside actinobacteria.
In summary, this is an exciting and timely work, reporting a
significant finding. Therefore, I would strongly support publication of this work in Biology Direct.
Questions
1. In instances where you do not find Pup proteins could it be a
gene prediction error? Do you predict short ORFs that maybe
missed by conventional gene prediction programs?
Authors' response: In all organisms where a PafA gene is
found a gene encoding Pup is found as its neighboring
gene. Being a small protein it has not been annotated in
several actinobacteria and Rhodopirellula. We have translated some of these as examples and include it in additional file 1.

The manuscript "Unraveling the biochemistry and provenance
of pupylation: a prokaryotic analog of ubiquitination" by L. M.
Iyer, A. M. Burroughs and L. Aravind conveys the most spectacular bioinformatics-based discovery. Everything about this short
article is truly amazing, starting from its very modest size and
as-a-matter-of-fact style of presenting a genuine intellectual
breakthrough. Authors brilliantly combined comparative
genomics, structural bioinformatics and biochemical reasoning
to discover a novel enzymatic mechanism of tremendous biological importance. Although we are already quite spoiled by the
scale of insightful functional inferences produced by bioinformatics and comparative genomics, this study constitutes a
quantum leap into an entirely new dimension. The predicted
mechanism is so obviously elegant that its "reduction to practice", which will inevitably follow very soon, will hardly add
much to the story. In addition to establishing a new enzymology, the authors provided solid evidence that the physiological
role of pupylation, at least in some bacteria, extends beyond tagging proteins to proteasomal cleansing. This observation opens
a new line of studies that will likely follow. Finally, this paper
provides an excellent tutorial in advanced bioinformatics and
the most compelling illustration of its impact in biological discovery.
Questions
1. Do you believe that there is a specific terminal Gln deamidase working in TB? If yes, any candidates?
Authors' response: Gene neighborhoods do not reveal any
candidates for glutamine deamidation. Given that the
deamidation reaction is related to that proposed to be cat-

Biology Direct 2008, 3:45

alyzed by the Pup ligase it is possible that in cases where a
terminal glutamine is found it first deamidates it before
proceeding with the ligase reaction. Alternatively a nonspecific amidase might be involved.
