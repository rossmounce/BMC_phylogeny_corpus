Abstract
Background: Initial step of β-oxidation is catalyzed by acyl-CoA dehydrogenase in prokaryotes
and mitochondria, while acyl-CoA oxidase primarily functions in the peroxisomes of eukaryotes.
Oxidase reaction accompanies emission of toxic by-product reactive oxygen molecules including
superoxide anion, and superoxide dismutase and catalase activities are essential to detoxify them
in the peroxisomes. Although there is an argument about whether primitive life was born and
evolved under high temperature conditions, thermophilic archaea apparently share living systems
with both bacteria and eukaryotes. We hypothesized that alkane degradation pathways in
thermophilic microorganisms could be premature and useful to understand their evolution.
Results: An extremely thermophilic and alkane degrading Geobacillus thermoleovorans B23 was
previously isolated from a deep subsurface oil reservoir in Japan. In the present study, we identified
novel membrane proteins (P16, P21) and superoxide dismutase (P24) whose production levels
were significantly increased upon alkane degradation. Unlike other bacteria acyl-CoA oxidase and
catalase activities were also increased in strain B23 by addition of alkane.
Conclusion: We first suggested that peroxisomal β-oxidation system exists in bacteria. This
eukaryotic-type alkane degradation pathway in thermophilic bacterial cells might be a vestige of
primitive living cell systems that had evolved into eukaryotes.

Background
Thermophilic bacteria offer crucial advantages over mesophilic or psychrophilic bacteria, especially when they are
applied to ex-situ bioremediation processes. Limited biodegradation of hydrophobic substrates caused by low
water solubility at moderate temperature conditions can
be overcome if the reaction temperature could be
increased enough. We previously isolated an extremely
thermophilic alkane-degrading bacterium, Goebacillus
thermoleovorans (previously Bacillus thermoleovorans) B23,
from a deep-subsurface oil reservoir in Japan [1,2]. Strain

B23 effectively degraded alkanes at 70°C with the carbon
chain longer than twelve, dodecane. Since tetradecanoate
and hexadecanoate or pentadecanoate and heptadecanoate were accumulated as degradation intermediates
of hexadecane or heptadecane, respectively, it was indicated that the strain B23 degraded alkanes by a terminal
oxidation pathway, followed by β-oxidation pathway.
Recently, another long-chain alkane degrading Geobacillus
thermodenitrificans NG80-2 was also isolated from a deepsubsurface oil reservoir [3] and its complete genome
sequence was determined [4].

Besides their biotechnological importance, thermophilic
microorganisms maintain interesting features useful for
studying evolution of life. Microorganisms living under
extremely high temperature condition, such as hyperthermophilic archaea and hyperthermophilic bacteria, share
the cellular mechanisms with not only bacteria but also
eukaryotes [5,6]. This is consistent with an evolutionary
hypothesis based on a phylogenetic analysis of 16S and
18S rRNA genes, that hyperthermophiles are very primitive and are close relatives of the common ancestor of living organisms [7]. Extremely thermophilic bacteria, that
grow under deep subterranean environment, would also
add knowledge to the evolution of life because the condition at subsurface is regarded to be more stable than the
surface of the earth. Although alkane degradation is not a
central metabolic pathway of the cells, it would be
informative to compare the pathway of thermophilic bacteria with that of mesophilic bacteria and eukaryotes.
Since most studies on the alkane degradation pathway
have been performed on mesophilic microorganisms,
such as Pseudomonas oleovorans [8], Acinetobacter sp. [9],
Candida tropicalis [10], and Yarrowia lipolitica [11], we
decided to study on the alkane metabolisms of extremely
thermophilic bacteria. Recently, a unique alkane
monooxygenase that belongs to luciferase family was
reported for G. thermodenitrificans [12].
Here, we report that two novel membrane proteins, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and acyl-CoA oxidase activities
were dramatically increased in the cells of G. thermoleovorans B23 when they were grown on alkanes. Induction of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/60

above enzymatic activities upon alkane degradation has
never been reported for bacteria but reported for yeast,
such as C. tropicalis [13,14]. This result suggests that
alkane degradation pathway is at least partly shared by
eukaryotes and deep-subsurface thermophilic bacteria.

Results and Discussion
Microscopic observations
The shape of G. thermoleovorans B23 cells before and after
cultivation in the presence of alkanes was compared with
each other by a scanning electron microscope (Fig. 1a, b).
It was found that the cells became longer and thicker after
14-day growth on alkanes. No such swell was observed for
the cells grown in the absence of alkanes (picture not
shown). This dynamic change of cell shape prompted us
to analyze the cellular proteins produced in relation to
alkane degradation.
Induction of protein productions by alkanes
Comparative analysis of proteins by SDS-PAGE showed
that production levels of at least three kinds of proteins
were increased after 10-day cultivation with alkanes (Fig.
2a). These were 24 kDa, 21 kDa and 16 kDa proteins,
which were designated as P24, P21 and P16, respectively.
Although a protein band at 40 kDa (P40) also seems to
increase in Fig. 2a, reappearance of this phenomenon was
not high (see Fig. 3) and therefore no further work was
performed on this protein. When the cells were simultaneously exposed to alkanes in rich nutrient L-broth, where
catabolite repression would have probably prevented
alkane degradation gene from being expressed, induction

recovered in an insoluble form, suggesting that they are
membrane proteins.
Amino acid sequences of P21 and P16
The N-terminal amino acid sequences of P21 and P16
were determined as AFPLSGVGGFTISADLI (P21-N) and

of these proteins were not observed. It is of interest that
increase in the production level of these three proteins
became significant at the time when alkane degradation
started (Fig. 2b). When we tested other hydrophobic substrates, no such induction was observed for palmitic acid,
tributyrin, trimyristin, or dicyclopropylketone (DCPK)
which is an inducer of alkane degradation gene expression
in P. oleovorans.
The effect of carbon chain length of alkanes on the induction levels of the proteins was examined. It is obvious that
the induction effect increases in accordance with the
increase in the chain length of alkanes (Fig. 3). It has previously been shown that strain B23 effectively degrades
alkanes longer than dodecane [1]. These results strongly
suggest that P24, P21, and P16 are related to the longchain-alkane degradation by strain B23 or the production
of these proteins was stimulated in the consequence of
alkane degradation. Localization of the proteins in the cell
was examined by fractionation of total cellular proteins
(Fig. 4). Because P24 was recovered in a soluble fraction
after disruption of the cells, this protein is probably a cytoplasmic protein. On the other hand, P21 and P16 were

VPISGVGEFXVTFDKL (P16-N), respectively. These
sequences, which are highly similar with each other,
showed considerable similarity with that of cholesterol
esterase from Streptomyces lavendulae [15]. Cholesterol
esterase is a secretion enzyme which hydrolyzes longchain fatty acid esters of cholesterol and mainly functions
in mammalian tissues. In bacteria, only actinomycetes
and pseudomonads [16] are reported to produce this
enzyme.
Cloning and analysis of genes encoding P21 and P16
Utilizing the information of N-terminal and internal
amino acid sequences, 416 bp and 1.8 kb DNA fragments
encoding a part of P21 and P16, respectively, were cloned
and their nucleotide sequence was determined. The 416
bp fragment was confirmed to encode a part of P21 protein, because other internal amino acid sequences IDVVVTGGNVSGQNLK
(P21-14)
and
TDNPLNVIDLSAPSLTLDK (P21-20) were encoded in the
gene fragment. Finally, 603 bp and 588 bp open reading
frames encoding 201 and 196 amino acid residues were
obtained for P21 and P16, respectively. Both P21 and P16
were suggested to be secretion proteins that are anchored
to the cell membrane, because possible signal peptides
(38 and 45 amino acid residues, respectively) were found
between the initiation methionine and the N-terminal
amino acids of P21-N and P16-N. Although cholesterol
esterase from S. lavendulae showed relatively high
sequence similarity with the N-terminal sequence of P21
and P16, the similarity scores became negligible when it
compared to the entire 201 and 151 amino acid residues
(5.7 and 10< of E values, respectively in BLASTP, http://
blast.ddbj.nig.ac.jp). This suggests that P21 and P16
would not be cholesterol esterase but unique membrane
proteins probably responsible for the alkane uptake, tolerance, or degradation pathway in G. thermoleovorans cells.
Geobacilllus kaustophilus HTA426 was isolated from deepest sea mud of the Mariana Trench and the genome
sequence has been determined (NC_006510). When we
look into its genome sequence, there are genes encoding
orthologous proteins to P21 (YP_148623, 99% identical)
and P16 (YP_148893, 94% identical). On the other hand,
to our most surprise there is no corresponding gene in the
genome of G. thermodenitrificans.
Gene expression levels of P21 and P16
Because P21 and P16, which are functionally unknown,
were suggested to be membrane proteins, significant
amount of these protein bands after 10 to 14-day cultivation on alkanes could be due to their accumulation in the
dead cell membrane. In order to eliminate this possibility,
production of P21 and P16 was examined at mRNA level.
The results, which were obtained from Northern blotting
experiment of P21, are shown in Fig. 5a. A strong signal
was detected at an expected position of approximately

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/60

700 bases when RNA sample was prepared from the cells
after 10-day culture. On the other hand, the probe DNA
constructed for detecting mRNA of P16 hybridized with
neither of RNA samples prepared, suggesting relatively
short half-life of the mRNA. Then, RT-PCR method was
adopted in this case, which is reported 106 times more
sensitive than Northern hybridization method [17].
When the template RNA was prepared from 10-day culture, DNA fragment of expected size, ca. 500 bp, was
clearly amplified by RT-PCR. The amplified DNA fragment was confirmed to be a part of P16 gene by determining the nucleotide sequence. No DNA amplification was
observed for RNA samples prepared from 0 and 4-day cultures (Fig. 5b).
These results strongly suggest that the production of P21
and P16 was timely induced by alkanes at a transcription
level. Because fatty acid, triacylglycerol, DCPK, and
paraquat were no efficient inducer of P21 and P16 production, it is plausible that alkane molecules directly or
indirectly control the transcriptional regulation of P21
and P16 genes.
Amino acid sequence of P24
The N-terminal amino acid sequence of P24 was determined to be PFELPALPYPYDALEP (P24-N). This sequence
was completely matched with that of superoxide dismutase (SOD) from strains in the genus Geobacillus. Cloning and sequencing of the entire gene encoding P24
revealed that it is a Mn-dependent type SOD of 204 amino

acid residues, and showed 99.0% identical to Mn-SOD of
G. kaustophilus HTA426 (YP_148310) or G. stearothermophilus (P00449) and 96% identical to G. thermodenitrificans NG80-2 (YP_001126490). The amino acid residues
responsible for Mn binding, 76-GGXXXHXXE-84 and 49QD-50, were completely conserved in P24.
Detection of enzyme activities responsible for eliminating
reactive oxygen molecules
SOD detoxifies superoxide anion to hydrogen peroxide,
which in turn is generally broken down to water by the
function of catalase or peroxidase. The B23 cells grown in
the presence or absence of alkanes were tested for SOD,
catalase, and peroxidase activity staining methods. The
SOD activity of the B23 cells grown in the presence of
alkane was slightly higher than that of the cells grown in
the absence of alkanes as expected (Fig. 6a). It was found
that catalase activity was detectable in the B23 cells only
when they were grown on alkanes (Fig. 6b). When 0.5%
glucose or glycerol was used as carbon source in the culture, the activities of SOD and catalase remained low. This
observation indicates that these enzymes responsible for
oxidative stress tolerance were produced as a result of not
nutritional starvation (shift from nutrient L-broth to LBM
mineral salts medium) but of alkane metabolisms. On the
other hand, neither the SOD nor catalase was induced by
alkanes in the G. thermoleovorans LEH-1 cells. Although it
has been reported that LEH-1 showed relatively high peroxidase activity irrespective of the presence and absence of
alkane in the media [18], this enzyme activity was not

detectable level for both the B23 and H41 cells (figure not
shown). Interestingly, SOD activity in LEH-1 cells with
alkanes was disappeared in the presence of alkanes. This
would have been occurred because SOD inducible oxygen
molecules were mostly consumed by alkane degradation
enzymes including acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and by
regeneration of NAD+.
Detection of acyl-CoA oxidase activity of B23
Both the SOD and catalase activities were specifically
induced by alkanes at the time when strain B23 started to
degrade alkanes. The SOD activity of G. thermoleovorans
B23 cells was also inducible upon addition of paraquat in
the medium, which generates superoxide anion (figure
not shown). It seemed most likely that high SOD activity
was required to detoxify superoxide anion, which was
generated as a result of alkane degradation including oxidase reaction. So it is probable that a kind of oxidases catalyzes a step of alkane degradation pathway of G.
thermoleovorans B23. Therefore, oxidase activity of the B23
cells was examined using tetradecane, tetradecanal, tetradecanol, or tetradecanoyl-CoA as a substrate. Increase in
500 nm (H2O2 formation) after the enzyme reaction was
<0.01, 0.02, <0.01, and 0.16 for tetradecane, tetradecanal,
tetradecanol, and tetradecanoyl-CoA, respectively. As far
as we know, tetradecanoyl-CoA oxidase activity has never
been reported for bacteria. As for acyl-CoA oxidase in bacteria, the gene encoding short chain acyl-CoA oxidase has
been cloned from Streptomyces fradiae, which forms a biosynthetic gene cluster of macrolide antibiotic, tylosin [19].
In both the bacterial cells and mitochondria of eukaryotic
cells, the first and rate-limiting step of β-oxidation pathway is catalyzed by acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, in which
acyl-CoA is transformed to enoyl-CoA. This acyl-CoA
dehydrogenase activity is replaced by acyl-CoA oxidase in
eukaryotic peroxisome [20]. Peroxisome is an organella
which generates and detoxifies reactive oxygen molecules
like hydrogen peroxide or superoxide anions. According
to the study of alkane degrading yeast Candida, peroxisome is highly developed in the cells grown on alkanes or
fatty acids [21]. The development of peroxisomes in the
cells of C. tropicalis grown on oleic acid was accompanied
by high level expression of peroxisomal proteins, including acyl-CoA oxidase [13]. Catalase is also a marker
enzyme of peroxisome and its activity in Candida cells
grown on hydrocarbons was much higher than that in the
cells grown on lauryl alcohol, glucose or ethanol.
Although acyl-CoA oxidase is reported to increase in the
Candida cells grown on fatty acids or organic acids, too,
neither palmitic acid (hexadecanoic acid) nor oleic acid
(octadecenoic acid) was an effective inducer for the production of acyl-CoA oxidase in G. thermoleovorans B23
(Fig. 7a). The acyl-CoA oxidase activity of strain B23
showed broad substrate specificity ranging from hexanoyl-CoA to octadecanoyl-CoA (Fig. 7b). Gene disrup-

tion experiments for P16, P21, P24 (SOD) and acyl-CoA
oxidase have not been successful at this point to conclude
that these enzymes are responsible for alkane degradation
pathway of the strain. However, dramatic increase in the
acyl-CoA oxidase, SOD, and catalase activities upon
alkane degradation strongly suggests that acyl-CoA oxidase functions at the initial step of β-oxidation and resulting superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide would be
eliminated by cooperative reaction of SOD and catalase.
This eukaryotic-type degradation mechanism of alkane in
G. thermoleovorans cells might reflect chaotic living cell systems of common ancestor under high temperature condition of the primitive earth. Evolutional relationship
between G. thermoleovorans and peroxisome in the eukaryotic cells are of great interest.

Conclusion

We, for the first time, suggested that peroxisomal β-oxidation pathway exists in an extremely thermophilic alkane
degrading Geobacillus thermoleovorans B23. This eukaryotic-type alkane degradation pathway in the bacterial cells
might be a vestige of primitive living cell systems that
would had evolved into eukaryotes.

Methods
Cells and plasmids
An extremely thermophilic alkane-degrading bacterium,
Geobacillus thermoleovorans B23 was previously isolated

from a deep petroleum reservoir in Minami-aga oil field
(Niigata, Japan, [1]). G. thermoleovorans type strain LEH-1
(ATCC43513) was purchased from ATCC (American Type
Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, [22]) and used as a
comparative strain. E. coli DH5α was used as a host strain
for the gene cloning with a cloning vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen Corp., San Diego, CA).E. coli strain XL1-Blue MRA
(P2) was used as a host strain for construction of a phage
library of B23 genome.
Culture media
Nutrient L-broth contained (per liter) 5 g of yeast extract
(Difco, Detroit, MI), 10 g of Bacto-tryptone (Difco), and 5
g of NaCl (pH 7.2) was used for cultivation and storage of
the strains. Cells were aerobically grown in a screw capped
culture bottle without shaking at 70°C or 60°C for B23
and LEH-1, respectively. The bottle cap was opened once
a day to avoid oxygen depletion. Solid medium was prepared by adding 1.5% agar or 4% gellan gum (Wako Pure
Chemicals, Osaka, Japan). Mineral salts medium, LBM
[23], was used for alkane degradation and protein induction experiments. LBM contained per liter; 0.25 g NaNO3,
0.25 g NH4Cl, 0.21 g Na2HPO4, 0.20 g MgSO4-7H2O,
0.09 g NaH2PO4, 0.04 g KCl, 0.02 g CaCl2, 1 mg FeSO4,
10 ml Trace mineral solution. Trace mineral solution contained per liter; 7 mg ZnSO4-7H2O, 1 mg H3BO4, 1 mg
MoO3, 0.5 mg CuSO4-5H2O, 18 μg CoSO4-7H2O, 7 μg
MnSO4-5H2O. Otherwise mentioned, LBM was supplePage 6 of 9

mented with 1 ml (0.1%, v/v) single alkane or alkanes
mixture (Standard gas oil, sulfur content 500 ppm level,
Tokyo Chemical Industry, Tokyo, Japan). Alkanes used for
cultivation substrate were filtrated (Millex-FG filter, pore
size 0.2 μm, Millipore, Molsheim, France) for sterilization
before use.
Scanning electron microscopy
Cells before and after grown on alkanes were washed with
0.1 M K2HPO4/KH2PO4 buffer (pH 7.2) and fixed with
2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in the same buffer for more
than 2 h. Then, the cells were washed again with the buffer
and dehydrated in acetone. After freeze-drying, specimens
were coated with gold-palladium and observed with a
Hitachi S-4700 scanning electron microscope (Hitachi,
Tokyo, Japan).
Induction of protein productions by alkanes
After aerobic cultivation in 1 L L-broth at 70°C for 24 h,
B23 cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8,000 g for
10 min at 4°C and then washed with LBM. The cell pellet
was suspended in 1 L LBM, which contained 0.1% (v/v) of
alkane or standard gas oil. Bottles containing the suspension were closed tightly and incubated at 70°C for appropriate periods without shaking. Proteins induced by
alkanes were analyzed by conventional SDS-12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE, [24]). Soluble
intracellular and insoluble membrane fractions of the
cells were prepared by sonication (Branson sonifier model
S-250, Branson Ultrasonics Corp., Danbrury, CT) and
centrifuge (20,000 g for 30 min, 4°C).
Amino acid sequence determination
The N-terminal amino acid sequences of the proteins were
determined with a sequencing system Procise 491
(Applied Biosystems Japan, Tokyo, Japan). Samples were
prepared by electro blotting the protein band from SDSpolyacrylamide gel onto a polyvinylidene difluoride
(PVDF) membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Electroblotting was conducted at 50 mA for 1.5 h in a transfer buffer
(10 mM CAPS, pH 11) containing 10% (v/v) methanol.
Proteins were stained on the PVDF membrane with 0.1%
Coomassie Brilliant Blue R in 40% (v/v) ethanol and 1%
(v/v) acetic acid and destained for 1 min in 50% (v/v) ethanol. A strip of the membrane containing protein band
was cut into pieces and subjected to the amino acid
sequence analysis.
Construction of B23 genomic DNA library
Total genomic DNA of G. thermoleovorans B23 was prepared as described previously [25] and was partially
digested with Sau3AI. Then the DNA fragments were
ligated with phage vector Lambda EMBL3 using Lambda
EMBL3/BamHI arm (Promega, Madison, WI) and packaged in vitro by Maxplax packaging extract kit (Epicentre
Technologies, Madison, WI).

Cloning of P24 (SOD) gene
Partial SOD gene was amplified by utilizing GeneAmp
PCR System 2400 (Applied Biosystems Japan) with AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan). PCR
amplification primers used were designed based on N-terminal amino acid sequence determined in this work and
a sequence of consensus region (Mn dependent type SOD
of B. stearothermophilus 193-VAKRYSEA-200, P00449).
InstaGene Matrix (Bio-Rad) was used for preparation of
genomic DNA.

In order to clone the entire SOD gene, inverse PCR
method was adopted. Genomic DNA, which had been
previously digested with SphI (for subcloning of 5'-end)
or AccIII (for subcloning of 3'-end), was self-ligated and
used for template DNA. For the analysis of DNA fragments, agarose gel electrophoresis was performed under
standard condition [23]. GeneClean kit (Bio 101, La Jolla,
CA) was used to recover DNA fragment from agarose gel
slices. The PCR amplified gene fragment was ligated independently into the cloning vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen
Corp.), with TA cloning kit (Invitrogen Corp.), and used
for transformation of E. coli DH5α. Nucleotide sequence
of the gene was determined by using ABI PRISM 310
genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems Japan). The nucleotide and amino acid sequence of P24, Mn-SOD of strain
B23, has been deposited in the EMBL/GeneBank/DDBJ
under accession number BAA95631.
Cloning of genes encoding P21 and P16
In order to clone the genes encoding P21 and P16, their
internal amino acid sequences were determined as follows. Target proteins were prepared by slicing the SDSPAGE gel and eluting out by vortex with 20 mM Tris-HCl
(pH 8.0) containing 1% SDS overnight. After digestion of
the protein with lysyl endopeptidase (LEP) under standard condition [26], each peptide fragment was fractionated by reverse phase HPLC (column: AQUAPORE
RP300, 4.6 × 250 mm, Applied Biosystems Japan) and its
N-terminal amino acid sequences was determined. Based
on these amino acid sequences, PCR primers were constructed to amplify the target gene loci. A part of the gene
encoding P21 was amplified by PCR with primers
designed for N-terminal amino acid sequence,
AFPLSGVGGFTISADLI (P21-N), and one of the internal
amino acid sequences, PSLNTHYMSAGSITIPSMK (P2137). B23 genome library was screened to obtain a phage
clone containing the entire gene encoding P21. The nucleotide sequence of this gene and its flanking region has
been submitted to EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ under accession
number AB047106.

A part of the gene encoding P16 was amplified by, what
we call, armed-PCR method using lambda EMBL3-B23
genomic DNA library as template DNA. The PCR amplification primers were designed for right arm of EMBL3 vecPage 7 of 9

tor (5'-CGTCCGAGAATAACGAGTGGATC-3') and one of
the internal amino acid sequences, AAQEFQTGADNITIDNGN (P16-16). The PCR amplified DNA fragments
(1.8 kb) were ligated into the cloning vector pCR2.1. The
complete nucleotide sequence was determined and found
that the DNA fragment encodes a part of the P16 gene,
including 5'-end. Utilizing this gene fragment as a probe,
B23 genome library was screened to obtain a phage clone
containing the entire gene encoding P16. The nucleotide
sequence of this gene fragment has been submitted to
EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ
under
accession
number
AB049820.
Northern hybridization and RT-PCR
Cultures were taken from a bottle after 0, 4, and 10 days
cultivation in the presence of alkanes. The cells were collected by centrifugation and frozen on dry ice. Total RNA
was isolated at the same time by the method of Reddy et
al. [27]. For Northern blot analysis, 20 μg each of total
RNA was electrophoresed on 1% agarose gel containing
formaldehyde as a denaturant. The RNA band was blotted
onto a Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using Transblot cell (Bio-Rad) under standard protocol. The PCR amplified 416 bp and 1.8 kb DNA
fragments were used for detecting the mRNA of P21 or
P16, respectively. Labeling the probe DNA, hybridization
to the target mRNA, and detection of signals were performed using Gene Images AlkPhos direct labeling and
detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) under
standard protocols.

In order to analyze the transcription level of P16 gene, RTPCR method was also adopted by using QIAGEN OneStep
RT-PCR Kit (QIAGEN). Ten micrograms of total RNA sample was used as the initial template for RT-PCR in each
case.
Activity staining of superoxide dismutase (SOD)
Cell free extracts were prepared as follows; cells after cultivation in LBM supplemented with or without alkanes
were washed and suspended with 50 mM K-phosphate
buffer (pH 7.8), and then disrupted by sonication in ice
bath. Cell disruption was monitored by microscopic
observation at appropriate time interval. After a centrifugation at 15,000 g for 30 min (4°C), the resulting supernatant was subjected to gel electrophoresis using 7.5%
non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel (pH 7.5)[24]. Then,
the SOD activity was detected by negative staining
method utilizing nitroblue tetrazolium [28].
Activity staining of catalase
Cell free extracts were prepared and subjected to gel electrophoresis as mentioned above. Then, the gel was rinsed
for 15 min three times with distilled water, soaked in a
solution of 0.01 ml of 30% H2O2 in 100 ml water, and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/60

gently shaken for 10 min. The H2O2 solution was discarded and the gel was immediately rinsed with distilled
water. A freshly prepared mixture of 30 ml each of 2% ferric chloride and 2% potassium ferricyanide was poured
onto the gel for staining. The gel tray was gently but steadily rocked by hand over a light box. As soon as green color
began to appear in the gel background, the ferricyanide
mixture was rapidly removed and the gel was washed
twice with water to terminate the coloring reaction [29].
Measurement of oxidase activity
Oxidase activity was assayed by the method of Shimizu et
al. [13]. The reaction mixture contained in 0.4 ml of 50
mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 0.33 μmol 4aminoantipyrine, 4.24 μmol phenol, 0.004 μmol FAD+,
0.04 μmol substrate, 12 IU horseradish peroxidase
(Sigma), and 0.1–0.2 mg cell free extract. Cell free extracts
were prepared from the 14 days culture with 0.1% alkanes
at 70°C. Although horseradish peroxidase is not stable
under 70°C, we adopted this temperature for measuring
thermophilic oxidase activity of strain B23. The reaction
was carried out at 70°C for 10 min, and the production of
H2O2 was measured by increase in absorbance at 500 nm.
Tetradecane, tetradecanol, tetradecanal or tetradecanoylCoA was used as a substrate. Each value was an average of
triple experiments and was subtracted that of negative
control experiment without substrate.
