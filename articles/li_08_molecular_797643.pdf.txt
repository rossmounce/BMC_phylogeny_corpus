Abstract
Background: Pyrethroids and pyrethrins are widely used insecticides. Extensive applications not only result in pest resistance
to these insecticides, but also may lead to environmental issues and human exposure. Numerous studies have shown that very
high exposure to pyrethroids might cause potential problems to man and aquatic organisms. Therefore, it is important to
develop a rapid and efficient disposal process to eliminate or minimize contamination of surface water, groundwater and
agricultural products by pyrethroid insecticides. Bioremediation is considered to be a reliable and cost-effective technique for
pesticides abatement and a major factor determining the fate of pyrethroid pesticides in the environment, and suitable esterase
is expected to be useful for potential application for detoxification of pyrethroid residues. Soil is a complex environment
considered as one of the main reservoirs of microbial diversity on the planet. However, most of the microorganisms in nature
are inaccessible as they are uncultivable in the laboratory. Metagenomic approaches provide a powerful tool for accessing novel
valuable genetic resources (novel enzymes) and developing various biotechnological applications.
Results: The pyrethroid pesticides residues on foods and the environmental contamination are a public safety concern.
Pretreatment with pyrethroid-hydrolyzing esterase has the potential to alleviate the conditions. To this end, a pyrethroidhydrolyzing esterase gene was successfully cloned using metagenomic DNA combined with activity-based functional screening
from soil, sequence analysis of the DNA responsible for the pye3 gene revealed an open reading frame of 819 bp encoding for
a protein of 272 amino acid residues. Extensive multiple sequence alignments of the deduced amino acid of Pye3 with the most
homologous carboxylesterases revealed moderate identity (45–49%). The recombinant Pye3 was heterologously expressed in
E. coli BL21(DE3), purified and characterized. The molecular mass of the native enzyme was approximately 31 kDa as determined
by gel filtration. The results of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the deduced amino acid sequence
of the Pye3 indicated molecular mass of 31 kDa and 31.5 kDa, respectively, suggesting that the Pye3 is a monomer. The purified
Pye3 not only degraded all pyrethroid pesticides tested, but also hydrolyzed ρ-nitrophenyl esters of medium-short chain fatty
acids, indicating that the Pye3 is an esterase with broader specificity. The Km values for trans-Permethrin and cis-permethrin are
0.10 μM and 0.18 μM, respectively, and these catalytic properties were superior to carboxylesterases from resistant insects and
mammals. The catalytic activity of the Pye3 was strongly inhibited by Hg2+, Ag+, ρ-chloromercuribenzoate, whereas less
pronounced effect was observed in the presence of divalent cations, the chelating agent EDTA and phenanthroline.
Conclusion: A novel pyrethroid-hydrolyzing esterase gene was successfully cloned using metagenomic DNA combined with
activity-based functional screening from soil, the broader substrate specificities and higher activity of the pyrethroid-hydrolyzing
esterase (Pye3) make it an ideal candidate for in situ for detoxification of pyrethroids where they cause environmental
contamination problems. Consequently, metagenomic DNA clone library offers possibilities to discover novel bio-molecules
through the expression of genes from uncultivated bacteria.

Background
Pyrethroids and pyrethrins are widely used insecticides.
Natural pyrethrins are compounds with insecticidal activity extracted from chrysanthemum flowers. Pyrethroids
are synthetic compounds similar in structure to
pyrethrins, which have been modified over the years to
enhance their insecticidal activity and/or their persistence
in the environment [1]
Pyrethroids are likely to become more widely used as
organophosphate insecticides including diazinon and
chlorpyrifos are phased out due to the concerns regarding
their safety [2]. Extensive applications not only result in
pest resistance to these insecticides, but also may lead to
environmental issues and human exposure. A variety of
personnel are exposed to pyrethroids during manufacture
and application, diet, and drinking water. Although these
compounds are widely considered safe for humans [3],
numerous studies have shown that very high exposure to
pyrethroids might cause potential problems to man [4].
Such effects include suppressive effects on the immune
system, endocrine disruption, lymph node and splenic
damage, and carcinogenesis [5]. In addition, most synthetic pyrethroids possess apparent toxicity to fish and
other aquatic organisms, including aquatic invertebrates,
often at concentrations less than 1 μg L-1 [6]. Therefore, it
is important to develop a rapid and efficient disposal
process to eliminate or minimize contamination of surface water, groundwater and agricultural products by pyrethroid insecticides.
Bioremediation strategies have potential for eliminating
or reducing these residues. One such strategy would use
enzymes to degrade the pesticide residues, for example, in
bioreactors through which contaminated water could be
passed, or in washing solutions after post-harvest disinfestation of fruit, vegetables or animal products to reduce residue levels and withholding times [1]. Suitable enzymes
for degrading pesticide residues include hydrolases from
bacteria, vertebrates and insecticide resistant insects [7-9].
Carboxylesterases represent a group of highly variable and
multifunctional hydrolytic enzymes. They have potential
for use in the hydrolysis and synthesis of important ester
compounds of pharmaceutical, food, biochemical, and
biological interests. Some pyrethroid carboxylesterases
from pyrethroid-resistant insects have been purified and
characterized [8]. Some pyrethroid-degrading bacteria
including Bacillus cereus SM3 [9], Pseudomonas Fluorescens
[10], Vibrio hollisae, Burkholderia picketti, and Erwinia carotovora have been isolated from soils and rivers [11], The
only pyrethroid-degrading enzyme from Bacillus cereus
SM3 was purified and characterized. These studies have
indicated that the first step in the microbial degradation
and detoxifiction of pyrethroid compounds is the hydro-

sis of carboxylester linkage, and demonstrated that these
enzymes differ in substrate specificity, sensitivity to inhibitors, activation by metals and molecular mass. In a word,
this method only focuses on the culturable portion of
microorganisms. In fact, most microorganisms have not
been researched due to limitations in culturing microorganisms, it is estimated that more than 99% of microorganisms are thought to be unculturable or difficult to
culture in any given environment using standard cultivation methods and therefore not accessible as a source for
finding useful biomolecules [12,13]. In order to search for
new or improved bioactive products, the development of
metagenomic technologies over the past few years has
provided access to much of the prokaryotic genetic information available in environmental samples, independent
of culturability [14]. Through metagenomic cloning,
some genes encoding metagenomic lipases and esterases
have been identified in metagenomic libraries from different environmental samples such as soil, water, thermal
environment and deep-sea hypersaline anoxic basin [1518].
In this report, we constructed a metagenomic library from
vegetable soil for the isolation by functional expression
screening of plasmid clones with esterase activity. Several
clones with esterase activity were detected, and a novel
pyrethroid-hydrolyzing esterase with higher activity and
broader substrate specificities was selected for further
characterization including thermal stability, optimal temperature and substrate specificity. To our knowledge, this
is the first report so far on information about pyrethroidhydrolyzing esterase gene from the unculturable bacterial
genome. Further study is helpful to obtain excellent
detoxifying enzyme for use as bioremediation agents.

Results
Construction of a metagenomic library and screening of a
novel esterase gene
The prokaryotic DNA for metagenomic library, which was
used in all experiments, was extracted from vegetable soil.
A novel soluble esterase of Pye3 on an activity based strategy was designed. To test the quality of the library, 100
clones were randomly selected, and the recombinant plasmids were prepared. The average insert size was 4.2 kb,
and sizes ranged from 3 to 8 kb. Out of approximately
93,000 colonies, 6 clones were identified by their bright
blue color. The metagenomic library represented about
390 Mb of soil microbial community DNA. From these
clones, the plasmids were isolated, purified and transformed to fresh E. coli TOP10 cells, all colonies turned
blue again and the hydrolysis of pyrethroid was further
tested. The ability of the only one positive blue colonies E.
coli TOP10 (pZP6) to hydrolyze pyrethroid was confirmed
by GC-MS analysis. Therefore, pZP6 was subjected to further analysis. The size of cloned fragment in plasmid pZP6

a histidine, together constituting a catalytic triad sequence
(Ser 143, Asp214, His 251) [19,20]. An unrooted phylogenetic tree based on the amino acid sequences was constructed in order to further verify the evolutionary
relationship of the Pye3 protein to other known lipase/
esterase proteins, and 24 bacterial lipase/esterase proteins
representing 8 different families were selected for the phylogenetic tree analysis [21]. As shown in Figure 2, the Pye3
protein belongs to Family I.

was reduced when the fragment was digested with various
restriction enzymes, and the deletion derivatives were
screened according to pyrethroid-hydrolyzing esterase
activity, resulting in the subclone E. coli TOP10 (pZP6-3).
The sequence analysis indicated that the pyrethroidhydrolyzing esterase activity was attributed to a 2.6-kb
EcoRI fragment. The sequence analysis of the insert DNA
showed the presence of one open reading frame (ORF)
819 bp, encoding a polypeptide of 272 amino acids with
a predicted molecular mass (Mr) of 31.15 kDa.
Sequence analysis of pyrethroid-hydrolyzing esterase
A blast search in the databases of NCBI revealed that the
Pye showed moderate identity (45–49%) at the amino
acid level with several carboxylesterases from Shewanella
loihica PV-4 (132/266, 49%), Marinobacter aquaeolei VT8
(128/267, 47%), Rhodospirillum rubrum ATCC 11170
(130/263, 49%) and Nitrosococcus oceani ATCC 19707
(124/270, 45%). Multiple alignments of the deduced
amino acids of Pye with the most homologous proteins
were presented in Figure 1. The putative protein contained
the conserved active site motif of the pentapeptide GxSxG
found in most bacterial and eucaryotic serine hydrolases
(residues from141 to 146)with a serine acting as the catalytic nucleophile, a conserved aspartate or glutamate and

Overexpression and purification of recombinant Pye3
To investigate the biochemical property of Pye3, the
cloned gene was subcloned in frame with a six-histidine
tag sequence into a T7 RNA polymerase derived E. coli
expression vector of pET 32a + (Novagen) and expressed
in E. coli BL21 (DE3) with 0.5 mM IPTG induction. The
recombinant Pye3 was purified by Ni-NTA chromatography. Taking into consideration that the resulting recombinant protein should consist of the 272 amino acids with
an N-terminal fusion of 156 amino acids corresponding
to thioredoxin tag (Trx-tag), polyhistidine tag (His-tag), S.
tag epitope (S. tag) and a unique thrombin cleavage site
(Thrombin), and its total molecular mass should be about
48 kDa. It was observed about 48 kDa in a Coomassiestained SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3). This result is in agreement
with the calculated molecular mass of the predicted
amino acid sequence (31,15 kDa). The relative molecular
mass of native enzyme estimated by gel filtration on a calibrated column of Sephacryl 200 HR was 73,000 Da.
Hence, it is assumed that the purified enzyme (Pye3) is a
monomer. The pI value was estimated to be 5.2.
The effect of pH and temperature on catalytic activity and
stability
With ρ-nitrophenyl acetate as a substrate, the pH ranged
from 3.5 to 10.0 and the temperature ranged from 20 to
70°C. The absorption of ρ-nitrophenol varies when pH is
altered because of changes in equilibrium between ρnitrophenol and ρ-nitrophenoxide. Therefore, the release
of ρ-nitrophenol was monitored at 384 nm. The pH-activity profile of the enzyme was bell-shaped, with maximum
values at pH 7.0. The enzyme was found to be stable in the
pH range of 5.5 to 9.0. The optimal temperature for the
enzyme was 40°C. The enzyme was fairly stable at up to
45°C and had 54% of its activity at 50°C. It was completely inactivated at 65°C.
The effects of reagents and metal ions on enzyme activity
The presence of Hg2+ and Ag+ caused a complete inhibition at 0.5 mM, while less pronounced effect was observed
in the presence of the divalent cations (0.5 mM). The
enzyme activity was strongly inhibited by 0.1 mM ρ-chloromercuribenzoate, whereas the chelating agent EDTA
and phenanthroline (1 mM) showed little effect on the
enzymatic activity.

Substrate specificity
The substrate specificity towards ρ-nitrophenyl esters of
various fatty acids was shown in Table 1. Pye3 showed the
highest activity with ρ-nitrophenyl caproate (426 U/mg)
among the ρ-nitrophenyl esters examined. Both Km and
kcat values of purified Pye3 decreased with increases in
aliphatic chain length up to C4. The comparison of catalytic efficiency values (kcat/Km) for various substrates indicated that these values were dependent on the aliphatic
chain length of substrate. Short-chain ρ-nitrophenyl esters
seemed to be preferred substrates, whereas ρ-nitrophenyl
esters of longer-chain fatty acids were poor substrates,
Pye3 had no activity against ρ-nitrophenyl myristate and
ρ-nitrophenyl palmitate. Activity to ρ-nitrophenyl esters

of shorter-chain fatty acids was lower than that of ρ-nitrophenyl butyrate. Taking into consideration that lipases
prefer substrates with relatively long aliphatic chains,
these results showed the purified enzyme (Pye3) is an
esterase and not a lipase.
A range of pesticides such as organophosphorus insecticide malathion whose structures are similar to pyrethroid,
cis-permethrin, trans-permethrin, cypermethrin, fenvalerate, and deltamethrin were tested for substrate specificity
of the recombinant Pye3. The Pye3 hydrolyzed the pesticides tested at different hydrolysis rate (Table 2), the transpermethrin was hydrolyzed most rapidly, while deltamethrin was the least readily attacked, cis-permethrin was

these limitations based on the direct extraction of DNA
from bacteria in their natural environment. Metagenomic
approaches promise the accessibility of the genetic
resources and their potential biotechnological applications [13,23-25].
In fact, like most other proteins screened from metagenomic libraries, no information about a source microorganism could be obtained. Therefore, the success rate (the
number of positives divided by the library size) is relatively low [17,26]. In this study, the metagenomic library
represented about 390 Mb of soil microbial community
DNA was constructed. Through screening 93,000 clones,
6 esterase-positive transformants displayed blue color in
LB containing X-caprylate. Of which only one positive
clone among them was able to hydrolyze pyrethroid by
pyrethroid-hydrolyzing experiment. This confirms the
general trend that the discovery of novel pyrethroidhydrolyzing enzyme from the metagenome is not straightforward. The reason for low yield of novel pyrethroidhydrolyzing esterases can be attributed to a number of different factors, including the library construction (source
of DNA, number of clones, and average insert size of
metagenomic DNA), the probable unrecognition of regulatory elements from unknown bacteria in E. coli, difficulties of expression in heterologous host, the formation of
inclusion bodies, toxicity of expressed protein to host, sufficient quantities and stability of genes encoding proteins
and the choice of host organism. Therefore, this suggests
that the discovery of specific genes in a complex metagenome is technically challenging.

hydrolyzed approximately equal rate toward trans-permethrin. The Km and kcat values were calculated by fitting
the data to Michaelis-Menten equation (Table 2). The
purified enzyme showed comparable affinity against a
range of structurally similar pesticides with Km values
ranging 0.1–1.41 μM.

Discussion
Soil is often considered to be one of the main reservoirs of
microbial diversity on the planet [22]. However, the inability to cultivate most soil bacteria hampered fundamental attempts to determine the diversity of the prokaryotic
world and limited its industrial exploitation. In the last 20
years, new methods have been developed to overcome

Fortunately, metagenomic libraries were constructed by
using the vector pZErO-2, and a novel pyrethroid-hydrolyzing esterase gene was thus isolated and characterized.
Taking into consideration the complexity in the course of
directly cloning of pyrethroid-hydrolyzing esterase gene,
the ability to produce a blue precipitate pertinent to esterase enables screening for novel esterases from metagenomic libraries using E. coli as a host organism. In this
study, we initially selected 6 blue color transformants
with the esterase activity in LB agar plates containing 100
μM X-caprylate, the ability of those blue transformants
with the esterase activity to hydrolyze permethrin was
subsequently demonstrated by assaying permethrin
reduction, and further analysis determined that only one
transformant with the esterase activity hydrolyzed permethrin. These results showed that not all esterases are
capable of degrading pyrethroids. Furthermore, the Pye3
not only efficiently hydrolyzed ρ-nitrophenyl esters of
medium-short chain fatty acids, but also degraded pyrethroid pesticides tested, indicating that the Pye3 is an esterase with broader specificity. Although there have been
some reports on pyrethroid hydrolase from pyrethroidresistant insects, mammal organ, Aspergillus niger and

Bacillus cereus [1,3,9,27], some nucleotide sequences of
the pyrethroid-hydrolyzing enzyme genes were available
(accession no. NM-133960, accession no. NM-144930,
accession no. AY487948, accession no. Q964Q7, accession no. Q27698) [28,29], the pyrethroid pesticide degradative gene from the metagenomic library has not been
previously reported. To our knowledge, this is the first one
to be determined for pyrethroid-hydrolyzing enzyme gene
from the metagenomic library constructed from vegetable
soil.
The gene (pye) was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli
BL21 (DE3), and its product was purified to apparent
homogeneity and characterized. As a monomeric 31.15
kDa protein, the molecular mass of the Pye3 is smaller
than those of the purified permethrinase (61,000 Da)
from bacteria, the pyrethroid hydrolase (56,000 Da) from
Aspergillus niger ZD11, pyrethroid-hydrolyzing carboxylesterase (60,000 Da) from mouse liver microsomes, and
carboxylesterase E3 (58,600 Da) from Nephotettix cincticeps Uhler. The pH optimum of the Pye3 (pH 7.0) was
lower than that recorded from Bacillus cereus (pH 7.5) and
higher than that reported from Aspergillus niger ZD11 (pH
6.5). The optimal temperature of 40°C is similar to that
recorded from Bacillus cereus (37°C) and lower that
reported from Aspergillus niger ZD11 (45°C) [3,9].
The substrate specificity on different substrates was studied with the purified recombinant enzyme. The striking
feature for ρ-nitrophenyl caproate and ρ-nitrophenyl
caprylate was quite different from the specificities of other
microbial esterases [30], which are mainly specific for ρnitrophenyl esters of short-chain fatty acids, only the
enzymes from Bacillus. stearothermophilus [31], Sulfolobus
acidocaldarius [32], Bacillus licheniformis [33], and Lactobacillus casei CL96 [34] showed specificity patterns are similar to that of Pye3. Since the purified recombinant enzyme
hydrolyzed cypermethrin, permethrin, fenvalerate, deltamethrin, and malathion. Therefore, pyrethroid-hydrolyzing esterase seems to be capable of hydrolyzing a
relatively wide range of compounds with similar chemical
linkage, suggesting that it possessed broader substrate specificities, and this feature is same as pyrethroid hydrolase
from Aspergillus niger ZD11 [3]. However, this observation
does not quite agree with data reported by Motoyama et
al. and Stok et al. [27]. The pyrethroid-hydrolyzing carboxylesterase (BAC36707) from mouse liver microsomes
did not hydrolyze malathion. On the other hand,
Motoyama et al. found that one of five forms of carboxylesterases degraded malathion twice as fast as the fenvalerate, and three other forms possessed approximately equal
activity toward these two insecticides. In a previous paper,
there was a preference in both mammals and insects carboxylesterases for permethrin to cypermethrin, and transpermethrin to cis-permethrin [8,27], while carboxylesterase from Nephotettix cincticeps Uhler prefered cis-permeth-

http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/7/1/38

rin to trans-permethrin. But the pyrethroid-hydrolyzing
esterase possessed approximately equal activity toward
permethrin isomers. Therefore, it lacked stereoselectivity,
and this feature is different from that of carboxylesterase
E3 from Nephotettix cincticeps Uhler [8] and carboxylesterase (BAC36707) [27]. In addition, the apparent Km values obtained for the purified enzyme (Pye3) were lower
than those for pyrethroid-hydrolyzing carboxylesterase
(BAC36707) from mouse liver microsomes, carboxylesterase E3 from Nephotettix cincticeps Uhler and pyrethroid
hydrolase from Aspergillus niger ZD11 when the same substrates were used, indicating a higher affinity for these substrates in the case of the Pye3. The comparison of Km and
kcat revealed that he pyrethroid-hydrolyzing esterase has
about 14-fold higher affinity towards trans-permethrin
than deltamethrin and can hydrolyze the former about
173-fold faster than the latter. The catalytic efficiencies
(kcat/Km) are considered as a measurement of the
enzyme,s specificity, among these substrates indicate that
trans-permethrin is clearly the preferred substrate.

Conclusion
In summary, the pyrethroid-hydrolyzing esterase gene
was successfully cloned using metagenomic DNA combined with activity-based functional screening from soil,
the recombinant Pye has been purified and characterized.
Taking into consideration that pesticidal residues resulting from agricultural production are complex mixtures,
enzymatic bioremediation requiring the development of
specific enzymes for each compound or isomer is unrealistic, therefore, the broader substrate specificities and
higher activity of the pyrethroid-hydrolyzing esterase were
necessary to fulfill the practical requirements of bioremediation to enable its use in situ for detoxification of pyrethroids where they cause environmental contamination
problems. Further studies will supply important data for
future application of novel pyrethroid-hydrolyzing esterase for promising environmental protection.

was transformed by electroporation with the library and
plated onto Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plates containing 50
μg/mL kanamycin, 100 μM 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylcaprylate (X-caprylate) and 0.5 mM isopropyl-β-D-thioga-

lactopyranoside (IPTG). A total of approximate 93,000
transformants were generated. A functional esterase
screening was visualized performed by blue color, which
was resulted from the hydrolysis of X-caprylate. To avoid
the isolation of false-positive clones, plasmid DNA was
isolated from the positive clones obtained in the initial
screening and retransformed, and the new clones were
examined on the same type of indicator plates for esterase
activity. The 6 blue colonies were further tested for its ability to hydrolyze permethrin through (GC-MS) analyses
[3]. The only one transformant with pyrethroid-hydrolyzing esterase was obtained and confirmed. Subsequently,
the plasmid was subjected to restriction analysis with
BamHI to identify the uniqueness of the clone. Unique
clones were sequenced to identify the inserted fragment of
metagenomic DNA. The fragment size of the plasmids was
6.3 kb. The size of the insert DNA fragment of the plasmid
pZP6 was reduced by using the EcoRI restriction site. The
resulting DNA fragment of 2.6 kb from plasmid pZP6 was
ligated into a EcoRI -digested pZErO-2 plasmid. The
ligated DNA was introduced into E. coli TOP10, the resulting clone Escherichia coli TOP10 (pZP6-3) was tested for
its ability to hydrolyze permethrin through (GC-MS) analyses [3].
Cloning and over-expression and purification of
pyrethroid-hydrolyzing esterase
The putative esterase gene was amplified from the pZP6-3
plasmid by using the primers and to introduce BamHI and
HindIII restriction sites for cloning in the pET32a (+). The
following primers were used: pye-fw (5-CGCGGATCCATGCCAAGTGATCAAAGAG; the BamHI site is shown in
italics) and pye-rv (5-CCCAAGCTTGTTGGTGTCCTGCAGGAAAC; the HindIII site is shown in italics). The
PCR product was digested with BamHI/HindIII, and then
ligated into BamHI/HindIII digested expression vector
pET-32a (+), and transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3)
(Stratagene). The E. coli transformed with this plasmid
was plated on LB agar containing 50 μg/mL kanamycin.
The transformant was grown in a 250-ml flask containing
50 ml LB medium supplemented with 50 μg/mL kanamycin at 37°C until the cell concentration reached OD600 nm
of 0.6, and 0.1 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside
(IPTG) of a final concentration to induce target protein
expression. After incubation at 25°C for 18 h with shaking at 200 rpm, Cells were harvested by centrifugation (6,
000 g for 20 min at 4°C) and resuspended in 50 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.6)-10 mM EDTA and disrupted by sonication
for 10 s in ice-water bath. The cell debris was removed by
centrifugation at 10,000 g for 5 min at 4°C. The clear
supernatant was collected and the recombinant Pye was
purified with his-tag affinity column. The supernatant was
applied to a Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) affinity chromatography column (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), equilibrated with buffer A (10 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM NaCl, 5

mM imidazole, pH 8) at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min). The
bound protein was eluted with buffer B (10 mM Tris-HCl,
500 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole, pH 8) at 4°C. The
purity of the enzyme was estimated by SDS (sodium
dodecyl sulfate)-PAGE (polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) in the eluted fractions, using 12% polyacrylamide
running gels. Protein concentration was determined by
the method of Bradford, bovine serum albumin (Sigma)
was used as standard for calibration [35]. Enzyme samples
were stored at -20°C until further use.
Determination of molecular mass and isoelectric point
The molecular mass of the denatured protein was determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). 12% SDS-PAGE was prepared
by the method of Laemmli [36]. Proteins were stained
with Coomassie brilliant blue G. The molecular mass of
the enzyme subunit was estimated using protein marker
as standards. The molecular mass of the native protein by
gel filtration on a Superose 12HR 5/30 column, gamma
globulin (160, 000 Da), bovine serum albumin (67, 000
Da), ovalbumin (43, 000 Da), carbonic anhydrase (30,
000 Da), was used as the reference proteins. Isoelectric
point (pI) was estimated by PAGE with 6.25% Ampholine
(pH 3.5~10) in a gel rod (0.5 by 10 cm) using a kit for Isoelecric Focusing Calibration according to recommendations by the supplier.
Analysis of enzyme activity
The esterase activity against ρ-nitrophenyl esters was
determined by measuring the amount of ρ-nitrophenol
released by esterase-catalyzed hydrolysis. The hydrolysis
of substrate was performed at 30°C for 10 min in 50 mM
sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1% acetonitrile. The production of ρ-nitrophenol was monitored
at 405 nm by Labsystems Dragon Wellscan MK3. One
unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of
enzyme that produced 1 μmol of ρ-nitrophenol per
minute from substrate under these conditions [3,17,37].
The pyrethroid-hydrolyzing esterase activities against pesticides and the pesticide assay were performed as
described by Liang et al. [3].

The optimum pH of the pyrethroid-hydrolyzing esterase
was measured using ρ-nitrophenyl caproate as a substrate
at 30°C. The buffers (at a final concentration of 50 mM)
used for the measurement were as below: citric acidNaOH (pH 3.5 to 5.5); potassium phosphate (pH 5.0 to
7.0); Tris-HCl buffer (pH 6.5 to 9.0), glycine-NaOH buffer
(pH 8.5 to 10.0). Overlapping pH values were used to verify that there were no buffer effects on substrate hydrolysis. The optimum temperature was determined
analogously by measuring esterase activity at pH 7.0 in the
temperature range of 20–70°C. The pH stability was
tested after incubation of the purified enzyme for 2 h at
30°C in the above different buffers. Temperature stability

http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/7/1/38

was measured after incubation of the purified enzyme in
50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) for 1 h at different temperature [17,38]. The effects of various chemicals (CaCl2, MgSO4, CuSO4, ZnSO4, MnCl2, AgNO3,
HgCl2, EDTA, phenanthroline, ρ-chloromercuribenzoate)
on the pyrethroid-hydrolyzing esterase activity were investigated by addition of the tested compounds into the reaction mixture, which was preincubated for 30 min at 30°C.
The activity was then measured described above and
expressed as a percentage of the activity obtained in the
absence of the added compound. Taking into consideration the fact that the poor solubility of most metal ions in
phosphate buffer, we use 50 mM N- (2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N'- (2-ethanesulfonic acid)-NaOH buffer (pH
7.0) in place of 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer.
Determination of kinetic parameters
Kinetic parameters against ρ-nitrophenyl esters were
determined by measuring enzyme activity using ρ-nitrophenyl acetate ranging from 0.02 to 1.5 mM, ρ-nitrophenyl propionate ranging from 0.01 to 0.8 mM, ρnitrophenyl butyrate ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 mM, ρnitrophenyl caproate ranging from 0.003 to 0.2 mM, ρnitrophenyl caprylate ranging from 0.005 to 0.4 mM, ρnitrophenyl laurate and ρ-nitrophenyl myristate ranging
from 0.03 to 2 mM as a substrates in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1% acetonitrile at 30°C.
An additional 0.04% Triton X-100 was included in the
reaction mixture in the case ρ-nitrophenyl caprylate. With
ρ-nitrophenyl palmitate as a substrate, 4% 2-propanol
was included in the reaction mixture in order to solubilize
the substrate. Kinetic parameters against different pesticides were analogously determined by measuring enzyme
activity over a range of final concentrations from 0.005 to
7 μM dependent on different pesticides. All initial velocities were determined at 5 time points which no more than
10% of the substrate had been consumed, and solution
content never exceeded 1% of the total assay volume, so
the decrease in substrate concentration remains linear
with time over the period of measurement and the rate
was almost constant throughout the assay, r-square values
ranged from 0.963–0.971 according to different substrates. Initial reaction velocities measured at various concentrations of substrates were fitted to the LineweaverBurk transformation of Michaelis-Menten equation [39].
Kinetic analyses by curve fitting were performed with the
SigmaPlot software [3].
