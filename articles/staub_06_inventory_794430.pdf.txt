Abstract
Background: Although baker's yeast is a primary model organism for research on eukaryotic
ribosome assembly and nucleoli, the list of its proteins that are functionally associated with nucleoli
or ribosomes is still incomplete. We trained a naïve Bayesian classifier to predict novel proteins
that are associated with yeast nucleoli or ribosomes based on parts lists of nucleoli in model
organisms and large-scale protein interaction data sets. Phylogenetic profiling and gene expression
analysis were carried out to shed light on evolutionary and regulatory aspects of nucleoli and
ribosome assembly.

deposited research

Results: We predict that, in addition to 439 known proteins, a further 62 yeast proteins are
associated with components of the nucleolus or the ribosome. The complete set comprises a large
core of archaeal-type proteins, several bacterial-type proteins, but mostly eukaryote-specific
inventions. Expression of nucleolar and ribosomal genes tends to be strongly co-regulated
compared to other yeast genes.

Background

ribosomal proteins imported from the cytosol meet complex
machinery for ribosome maturation and assembly. Ribosomal subunits leave the nucleolus in a state in which the
majority of their building blocks are already incorporated
[2,3].
Several lines of evidence suggest that ribosome biosynthesis
is not the sole function of nucleoli. They have been linked to

information

In prokaryotes, heat and distinct ionic conditions are sufficient to assemble a ribosome from its building blocks in vitro
[1]. In comparison, the biosynthesis of eukaryotic ribosomes
is a complicated procedure. Eukaryotic ribosomes are made
in the nucleolus, the ribosome factory of a eukaroytic cell. The
nucleolus is a dense compartment in the nucleus of eukaryotes where freshly transcribed ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and

interactions

Conclusion: The number of proteins associated with nucleolar or ribosomal components in yeast
is at least 14% higher than known before. The nucleolus probably evolved from an archaeal-type
ribosome maturation machinery by recruitment of several bacterial-type and mostly eukaryotespecific factors. Not only expression of ribosomal protein genes, but also expression of genes
encoding the 90S processosome, are strongly co-regulated and both regulatory programs are
distinct from each other.

cell growth control, sequestering of regulatory molecules (for
example, of the cell cycle), modification of small RNAs,
mitotic spindle positioning, assembly of non-ribosomal ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles, nuclear export, and DNA
repair [2,4-6]. The wide range of different functions linked to
the nucleolus is not surprising when considering the prominent position of ribosome biosynthesis with respect to cellular economy [7]. It seems as if the regulation of a broad range
of cellular mechanisms related to cell growth and division is
linked to the ribosome biosynthesis machinery through
nucleoli. The full range of molecules involved in this crosstalk is only beginning to emerge. Large scale proteomic analyses of nucleolar constituents [8,9] and a survey of the human
nucleolar protein network [10] have recently provided a first
global picture of the functional network of human nucleoli.
The baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a favorite
eukaryotic model organism for ribosome-related research.
However, knowledge about the set of proteins associated with
ribosomes or their nucleolar precursors in yeast is fragmentary. There are currently 439 yeast proteins annotated as
ribosomal, ribosome-associated, or nucleolar. Many have
been identified in genome-scale protein localization studies
[11,12] as well as studies of narrower focus [13-18]. Such
experiments usually represent only snapshots of cells in particular states. Furthermore, native protein localization might
have been altered when proteins are expressed with fusion
tags or as yeast two-hybrid baits or preys. Therefore, it is
likely that many additional nucleolar or ribosome-associated
proteins are still undiscovered. In support of this hypothesis,
studies on the proteomes of human and mouse-ear cress
nucleoli [8,9,19,20] identified hundreds of proteins that were
unknown before or have not yet been linked to the nucleolus.
The lists of nucleolar proteins from these distantly related
eukaryotes were only partially overlapping. Moreover,
Andersen and colleagues [9,21] found that a large proportion
of human nucleolar proteins localize to the nucleolus only
transiently, which might also have rendered their discovery in
yeast more difficult.
In this study, we aim to extend the fragmentary knowledge
about the protein parts list of yeast nucleoli. We present a
computational approach to predict novel nucleolar or ribosome biosynthesis proteins of yeast using data from orthologous nucleolar proteins and data sets on pairwise protein
interactions or protein complexes. Using a naïve Bayesian
classifier we predict novel proteins associated with nucleolar
or ribosomal components at high estimated sensitivity and
specificity. We study the evolution of these proteins using
phylogenetic profiles across 84 prokaryotic and eukaryotic
organisms, thereby complementing and extending earlier
computational studies on the function and evolution of the
nucleolus [21,22]. Finally, we investigate expression patterns
of nucleolar and ribosome-associated genes to characterize
the substructure of the nucleolar expression program.

Results and discussion
Prologue
This section is divided into three parts. In the first section, we
describe a comprehensive list of yeast proteins that we predict
to be associated with nucleolar or ribosomal components.
Note that in the following paragraphs such proteins will be
termed nucleolar or ribosomal component-associated
(NRCA) proteins. NRCA proteins do not necessarily have to
be associated with the ribosome or to be localized in nucleoli
during their whole life cycle. Instead, it is possible that a predicted NRCA protein localizes to the nucleolus only temporarily or binds to nucleolar components outside the
nucleolus. All proteins that associate with ribosomal and
nucleolar components are the targets of our predictions. In
this way we would like to capture all proteins that have the
potential to exert important functions on nucleolar and ribosomal biology. In the second part of the study, the identified
proteins are subjected to phylogenetic profiling, thereby providing insights into the evolution of the nucleolus and ribosome assembly. Finally, we characterize the gene expression
program for NRCA proteins by comparison of expression patterns of diverse functionally or evolutionarily related sets of
genes.

Prediction of novel nucleolar and ribosome-associated
proteins
A prerequisite for comprehensive functional and evolutionary
characterization of the nucleolus and the ribosomal machinery is a complete parts list of its proteins. We applied naïve
Bayesian classification to extend the known list of 439 proteins associated with nucleolar and ribosomal components in
yeast towards a complete inventory of such proteins. Before
prediction of new factors, we performed an extensive crossvalidation of our naïve Bayesian classifier to judge whether
we are able to predict NRCA proteins with considerable accuracy (Figure 1). To this end, we built 1,000 training sets, performed a cross-validation and obtained 1,000 receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The average area
under the ROC curve (AUC) was approximately 0.98, which
generally indicates a classifier of high performance. Based on
cross-validation and ROC analysis on the training sets, we
chose a conservative threshold of log(Opost) > 4 for the prediction of new NRCA proteins. During cross validation we predicted nucleolar proteins at a sensitivity of 50.4% and a
specificity of 98.6% using this threshold, indicating that our
predictions are very conservative.
Out of 6,281 proteins that were not annotated as NRCA proteins before, we predicted a further 62 to be linked to nucleolus/ribosome biology (Table 1, Figure 2). The experimental
evidence underlying our predictions can be encoded in a 7-bit
binary data string. All data strings that occurred in our analysis are summarized in Table 2 along with the prediction
results obtained for them. When sensitivity/specificity estimates of the cross-validation runs hold, we estimate that
there is approximately 1 false positive prediction among the

interactions

Furthermore, there were several surprising predictions of
novel nucleolar proteins. Two subunits (CKA1 and CKB2) of
yeast casein kinase 2 (CK2) were predicted to be nucleolar.
CK2 is known as a pleiotropic regulator of the cell cycle and
has recently been linked to the regulation of chromatin [28].

refereed research

Putative biochemical functions of several further predicted
nucleolar proteins are in accordance with a role in nucleolus
or ribosome maturation. The gene DHH1 encodes an RNA
helicase of the DEAD box family that was not found in nucleoli of ear cress or human, but interacted with known nucleolar
proteins in four independent data sets (Table 1). Another
DEAD box RNA helicase encoded by DBP2 was found in
nucleoli and in nucleolar complexes. In combination with
their putative biochemical function, this is strong evidence
that both RNA helicases play a role in nucleolar RNP assembly. The BCP1 gene is largely of unknown function, but its
deletion is lethal in yeast. It has been linked to nuclear transport and maturation of ribosomes through interactions with a
ribosomal lysine methyltransferase (RKM1), to a RAN-binding protein (KAP123), to a ribosomal protein (RPL23A) and
to its essentiality for nuclear export of the Mss4p protein.
Although little is known about the cellular function of the heat
shock proteins HSP82 and SSA2, their occurrence in nucleoli
is not surprising because protein folding is a fundamental
process during RNP assembly. Similarly, it seems reasonable
to assume a ribosomal function for the karyopherins alpha
and beta (KAP95, SRP1). The Uso1p-related myosin-like protein (MLP1) is linked to the interior side of the nuclear envelope and nuclear pore. It is proposed to act in the nuclear
retention of unspliced messengers. Its identification in nucleolar preparations suggests that it fulfills a similar role in the
control of RNA or RNP processing in the nucleolus.

deposited research

As a third group, we predicted several components of the
splicing apparatus to occur also in the nucleolus [26,27].
Among these are components of the major spliceosomal subcomplexes, namely the U1 small nuclear (sn)RNP protein
SMD2, the U4/U6 snRNP factors PRP3 and PRP4, the U2A
snRNP protein LEA1, the U2 components PRP9 and HSH49,
the U5 snRNP protein PRP8, and the Sm core proteins SMX2
and SMD3. Furthermore, we predict the nucleolar localization of the exon junction complex component SUB2 and the
spliceosome disassembly protein PRP43. U3 snRNP proteins

The fourth class is linked to the regulation of genomic DNA
structure and chromatin. The nucleolar association of several
nucleosome components like histone H2A.2 (HTA2), H4
(HHF2), H2B.2 (HTB2), H2B (HFB1), and an H2A variant of
the F/Z family (HTZ1) is not surprising as genomic DNA is an
integral part of nucleoli that are formed by fusion of so-called
nucleolar organizer regions (NORs), stretches of genomic
DNA carrying rRNA genes. DNA topoisomerase I (TOP1)
could be required to relax tension in DNA structure in NORs,
either during replication or transcription. SPT16 is an essential general chromatin assembly factor that is known to assist
in RNA polymerase II transcription. Rvb1p (RVB1) is also
essential for yeast viability and known as a component of
chromatin remodeling complexes. Our results suggest that
both proteins are involved in remodeling the chromatin of
NORs.

reports

The second class comprises factors that are linked to transcription. Whereas RNA polymerase I is the natural polymerase for the transcription of rRNA genes in the nucleolus, we
additionally predicted the nucleolar association of the RNA
polymerase II factors SUA7, RPO21, DST1, TFG2, RPB3,
TIF4631, and TAF14, and the RNA polymerase III factors
RPO31 and RET1. Several of these factors (RPO21, TIF4631,
TAF14, RPB3, RPO31, RET1) have not been identified in
nucleolar preparations, but were linked to other nucleolar
proteins by shared participation in protein complexes and/or
interactions in independent experiments. Therefore, it is possible that they associate with nucleolar/ribosomal proteins
only outside the nucleolus. The remaining factors were all
identified in at least one nucleolar purification experiment,
suggesting that they could play yet undiscovered roles as regulators of ribosomal gene expression by RNA polymerase I.

are already known to contribute to early steps in ribosome
assembly and are components of the 90S processosome. We
propose that the identified spliceosomal proteins have as yet
unknown functions in the assembly of ribosomes and/or
other nucleolar RNPs.

reviews

The majority of newly predicted NRCA proteins belong to
four functional classes. The first class consists of proteins that
were known as regulators of translation before: the
translation initiation factors TIF1, SUI3, SUI2, TIF2, GCD1,
TIF4631, the translation elongation factors TEF1, TEF4,
EFT1, SPT5, the translational release factor SUP45, and the
translocon component KAR2. We identified these proteins
not only because of their physical interactions with other
translation factors or ribosome components, but also because
each factor has orthologs in human and/or mouse-ear cress
that have been detected in nucleoli. Although the ribosomal
association of these factors was known before, their appearance in the nucleolus is surprising. It lends further support to
the hypothesis that ribosomal subunits in the nucleus already
have translational competence [23-25]. Alternatively, the
nucleolar translation factors could support the assembly or
quality control of ribosomes, for example, by ensuring
through their physical presence that their future binding sites
are assembled and modified correctly.

62 proteins and that we missed about another 62 proteins by
our approach. We conclude that the complete inventory of
nucleolar and ribosome-associated proteins in yeast comprises 439 previously known proteins, 62 predicted in this
analysis, and about another 62 proteins that remain to be discovered. Thus, we hypothesize that, in total, approximately
560 genes (more than 8% of the total gene content) encode
proteins related to nucleolar or ribosomal biology in yeast.

information

We established presence-absence patterns of genes across
multiple organisms, so called phylogenetic profiles, for all 501
NRCA proteins (Figures 2, 3, 4) to investigate their ancestry
in the three domains of life. We identified a large cluster of 83
yeast proteins by hierarchical clustering with orthologs in the
majority of archaeal species under investigation, but only single orthologs in bacteria (Figure 4). Among the archaeal proteins were many maturation factors and components of the
ribosome. From a biochemical viewpoint, together with a few
proteins that are ubiquitous in all domains of life, these

refereed research

During revision of this manuscript we became aware of several old and new articles that add experimental evidence to
some predictions of nucleolar or ribosome-associated proteins made in this manuscript. We were not of aware of the
ribosomal or nucleolar roles of these proteins before, because
such annotations were missing in the Saccharomyces
Genome Database (SGD) database at the time of analysis. In
the following we shortly describe these findings of others.
Lebaron et al. [30] and Leeds et al. [31] found that the Prp43
protein, a putative DEAH helicase, is a component of multiple
pre-ribosomal particles and localizes to the nucleolus. We

We note that, in total, only 11 of 62 proteins have been identified solely on the basis of protein interactions; the remaining
51 proteins have nucleolar orthologs in model species. We
expect that the latter perform yet undiscovered functions in
the nucleolus, although they have been linked to extra-nucleolar or even cytosolic processes like splicing, nuclear ribosome import/export, or translation before. The former are
candidates for yeast-specific nucleolar localization or for
extra-nucleolar ribosome maturation. Further functional
characterization is hardly possible using only presently available data and would, therefore, require additional
experiments.

predicted a nucleolar role of Prp43 via evidence from nucleolar preparations in model organisms and from protein-protein interactions. Schafer et al. [32] have shown recently that
the protein kinase HRR25 (casein kinase I) binds pre-40S
particles, phosphorylates Rps3 and the maturation factor
Enp1, and is required for maturation of the 40S subunit in
vivo. We predicted a ribosomal/nucleolar role for HRR25
based on the occurrence of the human HRR25 ortholog in
nucleolar preparations and on the co-occurrence of HRR25
with other nucleolar proteins in affinity-purified protein complexes (Table 1). In 2001, Bond et al. [33] had already shown
that DBP2 is not only involved in nonsense-mediated mRNA
decay, but is also a ribosome biogenesis factor as DBP2
mutant cells are deficient in free 60S subunits and 25S rRNA
is significantly reduced. This link has apparently escaped the
attention of SGD database curators for years. We rediscovered the link of DBP2 with ribosomal biology through a prediction based on nucleolar localization of the human DBP2
ortholog and through interactions with nucleolar proteins in
protein complex data of two independent studies (see table 1).
In 2000, Edwards et al. [34] found that yeast topoisomerase
TOP1 localizes to the nucleolus dependent on its interaction
with nucleolin. We rediscovered this link because of the cooccurrence of yeast TOP1 in protein interactions and complexes with nucleolar components and the nucleolar localization of human TOP1. These four cases are independent
experimental validations of our predictions.

reviews

Therefore, we hypothesize that CK2 regulates chromatin
accessibility in nucleolar organizer regions. Casein kinase 1 is
known for its function in intracellular vesicle transport and
secretion [29]. A nucleolar role of casein kinase 1 (HHR) was
not known during preparation of this manuscript, but was
published during the revision stage (see Note added in proof).
An F1 beta subunit component of the F1F0-ATPase complex
(ATP2) has been detected in nucleolus purifications of both
ear cress and human. This strongly suggests a dual function
for this protein in respiration and the nucleolus. The nucleolar localization of a mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier protein
(AAC3) was also detected in both model organisms and is
supported by protein interactions to nucleolar proteins.

Figure 1 of previous page)
Estimation(seeprediction accuracy
Estimation of prediction accuracy. The accuracy of predictions was estimated from 1,000 runs of 10-fold cross-validations using 1,000 alternative
training sets (see Materials and methods). The threshold/working point used for the final predictions of new nucleolar proteins is marked in each plot. (a)
The sensitivity (SE = TP/(TP + FN)) of our classifier is plotted over different thresholds of classifier scores (log posterior odds ratios) applied to each crossvalidation run. The logarithmic posterior odds ratios indicate how likely it is under the naïve Bayesian model that a protein is an NRCA protein (positive
scores) versus that it is not an NRCA protein (negative scores). A single point on the line and its error bar stems from calculations of the average
sensitivity and its standard deviation obtained from 1,000 cross-validation runs using a distinct classification score threshold. Confidence intervals are ± 2fold standard deviation intervals around the mean. Note that at the threshold that was finally used for prediction (0.4) we expect to reach a sensitivity of
50.4%. This means that we have probably still missed as many NRCA proteins as we have predicted (62). (b) The specificity (SP = TN/(TN + FP)) of our
classifier is plotted over different thresholds of classifier thresholds (log posterior odds ratios) that were applied on results of each of 1,000 crossvalidation runs. Confidence intervals are ± 2-fold standard deviation intervals around the mean. Note that at the finally used threshold of 0.4 the specificity
reaches 0.986, meaning that we expect only 1.4% of false positives among our predictions. (c) The ROC curve of our classifier is plotted as sensitivity
versus (1-specificity). Each individual data point reflects predictions at a single cross-validation run when a single prediction threshold is applied. The
central line is based on averaged SE/SP values for each threshold applied. The ROC curve gives an impression of the quality of a classifier. It is a general
indicator of classification performance. The bigger the AUC, the better the classifier. We obtained an AUC value of 0.98, which generally indicates a
classification of high quality. The ROC curve was also the basis for the selection of our final classifier threshold, as it illustrates the trade-off between
sensitivity and specificity. We chose to be very conservative (high specificity) for the sake of missing true NRCA proteins (lower sensitivity).

The largest fraction of yeast NRCA proteins has multiple
orthologs in eukaryotes, but none in prokaryotes. Many of
these proteins can be regarded as eukaryotic inventions. This
group spans the whole range of nucleolar and ribosomerelated functions. Explicitly, we investigated the profiles of
components of the 90S processosome, a large complex
attached to freshly transcribed rRNA that performs early
maturation steps before ribosomal proteins and rRNA are
assembled into subunits. The 90S processosome proteins do
not show strong similarity to prokaryotic proteins, although
they are strongly conserved in eukaryotes (Figure 4). As
ribosome assembly in eukaryotes is much more complex than
in prokaryotes, the finding that the 90S processosomal
machinery has no prokaryotic counterpart is not surprising.

interactions

There is a considerable, but much smaller, fraction of nucleolar proteins that have orthologs in bacteria, but not in archaea
(Figure 3). Among these are RRP5, which is essential for the
processing of 18S and 5.8S rRNA [35], and the 3'-5'
exonuclease DIS3, which is required for the processing of
5.8S rRNA and is a component of the exosome [36]. Eukaryotes have employed these bacterial-type proteins for the
processing of archaeal-type ribosomes. More detailed phylogenetic studies will have to show whether these bacterial-type
proteins are even of alpha-proteobacterial (that is,
mitochondrial/hydrogenosomal) origin. Interestingly, several proteins of mitochondrial ribosomes seem to localize to
the nucleolus (MRPS28, MRPL9, MRPL23, YML6). Unlike
most other mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, YML6 is essential for yeast viability, indicating that it does not exclusively
function in mitochondria. The dual nucleolar and mitochondrial localization of these proteins means that they have taken
over important functions in nuclear ribosome maturation in
addition to their roles in mitochondrial ribosomes. RNAase
III encoded by the RTS1 gene is involved in the processing of
U2 snRNA, highlighting also the chimeric evolutionary origin

of the machinery for RNA splicing. The tRNA-isopentenyltranferase MOD5 is known as one of the few proteins that
occur in three subcellular compartments: cytosol, mitochondria, and the nucleus [37]. Its phylogenetic profile shows that
MOD5 shares a common sequence ancestor with bacteria.
The finding that eukaryotes employed bacterial-type, possibly
mitochondrial, proteins to supplement the archaeal-type
ribosome maturation machinery is congruent with earlier
observations on the level of protein domains [22].

refereed research

archaeal-type proteins seem to represent the functional core
of the nucleolus and of ribosome maturation.

deposited research

The data used for classification and the detailed prediction results are listed for all 62 proteins that passed our threshold of Opost > 0.4. These
proteins had not been annotated as associated with nucleolar or ribosomal components before, but were classified as such in our analysis. A
literature survey for the predicted proteins revealed that for four proteins a role in the nucleolus and ribosome biogenesis had already been
established (see Note added in proof). The lower part of the table lists 11 proteins that were predicted as NRCA proteins solely on the basis of
shared participation in complexes or interactions. For these proteins, we do not necessarily predict a nucleolar localization, but direct interaction
with nucleolar/ribosomal components at least under one specific cellular condition at an unspecified locus within the cell. *Four proteins for which

Implications for hypotheses on the origin of eukaryotes

information

Genome Biology 2006, 7:R98

interactions

Under such a hypothesis of nucleolar evolution based on
'genome fusion' it is possible that eukaryotes with
mitochondria (or mitochondrial/hydrogenosomal remnants)
exist that have never evolved nucleoli. In contrast, eukaryotes
with nucleoli and without mitochondria would not be compatible with the hypothesis. Today, the existence of a eukaryote that lacks either mitochondria or nucleoli (or remnants of
them) has not been proven [45]. Recently, Xin et al. [46]
described a typical nucleolar protein in Giardia lamblia and
concluded that Giardia once had nucleoli. We conclude that,
so far, 'genome fusion' hypotheses are compatible with current data on nucleolar evolution.

refereed research

The fact that the largest fraction of nucleolar proteins lacks
counterparts in prokaryotes suggests that the nucleolus is primarily a eukaryotic invention. According to 'genome fusion'
hypotheses, the many eukaryote-specific nucleolar proteins
would have evolved after the genome fusion that led to the

The timely order of cellular transitions outlined above would
fit the 'genome fusion' hypotheses in which nucleoli evolved
as a compensatory mechanism to prevent dilution of ribosome assembly factors in an early eukaryotic lineage [22]. This
would have been necessary to maintain the efficiency of ribosome assembly in eukaryotes. At some time point the eukaryotic lineage must have evolved towards larger cell sizes, a
development made possible by more efficient catabolism via
mitochondria or hydrogenosomes [22]. In this scenario,
nucleoli have emerged after the mitochondrial precursor
symbiont entered its host cell, probably as a result of special
pressure exerted by larger cell volumes.

deposited research

According to 'genome fusion' hypotheses, the existence of
nucleolar proteins of archaeal and bacterial type would mean
that the nucleolus is chimeric, with building blocks acquired
from both archaea and bacteria. In contrast, 'primordial
eukaryote' hypotheses would either explain prokaryotic-type
proteins by gene uptake (either by horizontal gene transfer,
viral transfer or endosymbiosis) or by common ancestry with
genes in the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) with
subsequent loss in either the bacterial or archaeal lineage.

So far, considerations based on phylogenetic profiling do not
rule out either type of hypothesis. However, our study also
shows that proteins of the functional core of nucleoli are not
distributed evenly across the three evolutionary groups
(archaeal like, bacterial like, eukaryote specific). It is the
archaeal-like set of proteins in combination with the ubiquitous proteins that represent the functional core of nucleoli
and ribosome maturation. This leads us to the postulate that
bacterial-type and eukaryote-specific proteins were assembled around an archaeal-type functional core, and, therefore,
emerged later in the ribosome maturation machinery. How
does this fit into the different types of hypotheses?

reports

What do all these results mean with respect to hypotheses
about the origin of eukaryotes? Although a phylogenetic profile can reveal a prokaryotic ancestry, it can not prove a
prokaryotic origin of a nucleolar protein. This question has to
be studied for all proteins by single phylogenetic analyses that
are beyond the scope of this study. When the first genomes
were available in the late 1990s, sequence comparisons led to
the postulates that 'informational' proteins in eukaryotes
stem from archaea and 'operational' proteins stem from bacteria and several authors have put forward hypotheses on the
origin of eukaryotes based on 'genome fusion' [38-42]. Kurland et al. [43] have recently called these interpretations into
question and argued that whole-genome sequence comparisons, many phylogenetic analyses (in which eukaryotic proteins do not branch within archaeal or bacterial orthologs),
and so called eukaryote-specific cellular signature structures
(CSSs) rather show that eukaryotes represent a primordial
lineage and are not just an amalgamation of prokaryotic
genomes. According to another recent hypothesis, eukaryotes, archaea and bacteria each evolved by independent transitions from the RNA world to the DNA world through viral
transduction [44]. The latter two hypotheses postulate that
eukaryotes comprise a lineage as equally old as bacteria and
archaea and are, hereafter, referred to as 'primordial eukaryote' hypotheses.

first eukaryote, thus at a relatively late time point in evolution. According to the 'primordial eukaryote' view, eukaryotespecific nucleolar proteins would be as equally old as the
prokaryote-type proteins and should also be witnesses of
early eukaryote (and even earliest cellular) evolution.

reviews

It shows that a large machinery of proteins acting in concert
at an early step during ribosome maturation has been
invented exclusively for the eukaryotic branch of life.

First, we compared the correlation of expression between
genes that encode nucleolar and ribosome-associated proteins with the correlation within all other yeast proteins.
There is considerably higher correlation of expression pat-

We examined this difference in more detail by unsupervised
clustering of expression data for a fused list of genes from
both large complexes (Figure 6). Hierarchical clustering
revealed that the majority of genes were distributed among
two large clusters. One cluster was composed nearly entirely
of ribosomal proteins, and the other cluster nearly entirely of
90S processosome proteins. We concluded that the 90S-processosomal expression program is highly co-regulated, but different from the ribosomal program. Thus, the 90S
processosome proteins not only differ from their ribosomal
functional associates with respect to evolution (see above),

information

The expression compendium of Hughes et al. [47] reflects a
considerable part of the global yeast expression program. We
studied this data set to identify particular groups of yeast
genes that are expressed similarly across the 300 experiments
of this global genetic perturbation study (Figure 5).

interactions

Distinct nucleolar gene expression programs: the
ribosome and the 90S processosome

In contrast, the protein components of the ribosome show a
marked co-regulation that is much stronger than the co-regulation observed for all nucleolar proteins. The 90S processosome is a large particle formed around unprocessed rRNA
(see previous section). Surprisingly, we found that the degree
of co-regulation among 90S processosomal genes is comparable with, if not higher than, that among ribosomal protein
genes. We next asked whether co-regulation of ribosomal and
90S-processosomal genes is coupled, that is, whether they are
under the control of the same expression program. The crosscomparison of expression vectors of genes from both particles
suggests that their expression is different (Figure 5).

refereed research

In summary, our phylogenetic profiles are not sufficient to
rule out either 'primordial eukaryote' or 'genome fusion'
hypotheses. However, each future hypothesis about eukaryotic origins would also have to explain the hallmarks of nucleolar evolution highlighted above, that is, the archaeal nature
of the functional core of nucleoli to which bacterial-type additions and many eukaryote-specific proteins were recruited.

terns among NRCA protein-encoding genes, suggesting that
there is a special nucleolar expression program. One might
suspect that the ancient archaeal core of nucleoli, which
includes many ribosomal proteins and maturation factors,
constitutes a nucleolar subcomponent that exhibits an especially high degree of expression co-regulation. Therefore, we
divided our set of nucleolar/ribosome-associated proteins
into an archaeal set and a non-archaeal set and compared the
correlation of expression within these groups. The distributions of correlation coefficients look rather similar, suggesting that evolutionary age or sequence conservation is not
paralleled by tight expression co-regulation.

deposited research

'Primordial eukaryote' hypotheses presented so far have been
less specific about the timely order of events that generated
eukaryotic signature structures. Also, the driving forces that
led to major eukaryotic signature structures have not been
proposed. Hypotheses that postulate a eukaryotic 'raptor' as
the host cell that acquired mitochondria imply that a nucleolus and nucleolar structures like 90S processosomes (eukaryotic signature structures) preceded mitochondria. This
means that all eukaryotes with mitochondria should also have
nucleoli or nucleolar remnants. It seems as if all known
eukaryotes fulfill this criterion. However, unlike for 'genome
fusion' hypotheses, one might argue that eukaryotes with
nuclei and nucleoli that never had mitochondria/hydrogenosomes should have survived until today. But, as many recent
studies have shown, the existence of such eukaryotes has not
so far been proven [45].

reports

Our Bayesian classification approach assigns a distinct prediction to each possible binary pattern that could be associated with a protein. With the
seven data sources used here, only a limited number of 128 different combinations of binary evidences is possible. Here, all binary patterns that occur
in our data set are enumerated. They are supplemented by the prediction result to illustrate which input data generates which prediction. Note that
neither a single protein interaction nor a single occurrence in nucleoli of model organisms is sufficient for a positive prediction, and that evidence
from three protein interaction experiments is necessary for a positive prediction in the absence of evidence based on orthologs in nucleolar
preparations of model organisms. Column headers denote the data source: Hs, orthology to human nucleolar protein; At, orthology to mouse-ear

a large overlap between the sets of proteins of the 90S processosome and the so-called Ribi (ribosome biosynthesis) regulon [48-50]. Of 52 proteins of the 90S processosome, 46 are
also components of the Ribi regulon. We propose that the 90S
processosomal genes constitute a functionally defined module of the Ribi regulon.

Data columns k = 1, k = 2 contain information on whether a
yeast protein has an ortholog in human/Arabidopsis that has
been detected in purified nucleoli of these organisms by mass
spectrometry. We determined orthology relationships
between yeast proteins and human/Arabidopsis proteins
using INPARANOID [51]. If a yeast protein has an ortholog in
a model organism that was found in nucleoli, we set the
observation in the associated data vector to xk = 1. For data
columns k = 3, k = 4 we used the yeast two-hybrid data sets
for protein-protein interactions of Uetz et al. [52] and Ito et
al. [53]. Whenever a yeast protein was involved in a pairwise
protein interaction with another protein that is among the
219 known nucleolar proteins, we set the associated observation to xk = 1. For data columns k = 5, k = 6, k = 7 we used the
yeast protein complex data sets of Gavin et al. [54], Ho et al.
[55] and Krogan et al. [56]. Whenever a yeast protein
interacted with a nucleolar protein through shared participation in a complex, we set the associated observation to xk = 1.
The resulting data matrix with K observations for each yeast
protein was used for the prediction of new nucleolar proteins.

Using large-scale data sets of nucleolar proteins in Homo
sapiens and Arabidopsis thaliana and protein interactions
and complexes in S. cerevisiae, we predicted with high confidence that 62 further proteins are associated with nucleolar
or ribosomal components, thereby extending the list of nucleolar/ribosomal component-associated proteins to 501. A survey of their presence-absence patterns across 84 organisms
from all domains of life confirmed a shared ancestry of the
nucleolar functional core with archaea. It also revealed several additions of bacterial character, and that the majority of
nucleolus- and ribosome-associated proteins in yeast are
eukaryote-specific. Proteins of the 90S processosome tend to
be conserved across eukaryotes, but not in prokaryotes. In
summary, this suggests an exclusive emergence of many
nucleolar ribosome maturation factors in the eukaryote lineage. These findings represent novel insights into transitions
leading to eukaryote-specific structures and represent
cornerstones that have to be addressed by future hypotheses
on the origin of eukaryotes. Furthermore, the analysis of a
public gene expression compendium revealed that genes
encoding the 90S processosome are nearly as tightly regulated as genes encoding ribosomal proteins, but that the gene

vation for experiment k. This binary data vector carries information that will be used to predict whether a single protein is
nucleolar or not. The total number of different sources of evidence is K. Annotations of nucleolar localization for 439 yeast
proteins were retrieved from the SGD. We used seven sources
of evidence (K = 7), hereafter also termed data columns, to
judge whether a yeast protein is likely to be nucleolar or not.
By default, all observations were set to xk = 0.

Furthermore, phylogenetic profiles suggest that most 90S
processosome components are not just remnants of prokaryotic precursor proteins that could stem from an amalgamation of archaeal and bacterial contributions during the origin
of eukaryotes. The eukaryote-specific conservation of many
90S processosome proteins rather suggests that the 90S processosome emerged solely during eukaryotic evolution. Thus,
the 90S processosome can be regarded as an ancient eukaryote-specific functional module.

Training the classifier and estimation of classification
performance
To train our classifier for the prediction of new nucleolar proteins we needed positive and negative training data, that is,
sets of known nucleolar and non-nucleolar proteins. We
retrieved overlapping lists of 219 known nucleolar proteins,
239 proteins acting in ribosome biosynthesis, and 159 proteins associated with cytosolic ribosomes from the SGD. This
resulted in a non-redundant set of 439 nucleolar proteins,
which we used as positive training cases.
The acquisition of negative training cases was not as straightforward, because we suspect that, among the remaining 6,720
- 439 = 6,281 yeast proteins, a considerable number are
nucleolar ones. We consciously decided not to chose a biologically motivated approach to acquire negative training examples to avoid introducing an unknown biological bias into the
negative training set (for example, by taking only extracellular or organelle proteins as negative training data). Instead,
we obtained 1,000 random samples of 439 proteins (the same
size as the positive set) from all but the 439 nucleolar
proteins.
Each sample of negative training cases was combined with the
unique positive training set to yield a complete training data
set. For each of these 1,000 training data sets we performed
10-fold cross-validation. We applied a range of thresholds to
determine the sensitivity (SE = TP/(TP + FN)) and specificity
(SP = TN/(TN + FP)) and the ROC curve for each of the 1,000
cross-validation runs. We determined the average AUC from
1,000 cross-validation runs to judge the quality of our
classifier.

Based on the prediction results (see Results and discussion;
Figure 1), we estimate that our set of 6,281 non-NRCA proteins - for which we assumed that the majority of cases are not
NRCA proteins - does probably contain approximately 124
positives (1.97%). Thus, in retrospect, we estimate that, on
average, 9 of the presumed non-NRCA proteins are actually
positive when we sample 439 proteins at random to compile
a negative training set. This probably led to a slight reduction
in sensitivity and specificity of the classifier. However, as we
can not compile a better set of negative training cases without
introducing a systematic bias, we argue that repeated random
sampling of negative training cases is an adequate procedure
for this classification problem.

reports

After encouraging cross-validation results, we tried to predict
new nucleolar proteins from the set of 6,281 proteins not previously assigned as nucleolar using a similar strategy. We randomly sampled 1,000 sets of 439 negative training cases from
the 6,281 proteins and combined each with the 439 positive
training cases, thus yielding 1,000 training data sets. We built
1,000 classifiers from these training data sets. With each classifier we made predictions for all proteins not used for training. For a single prediction we used a threshold of log(Opost) =
0.4. Application of this threshold led to a sensitivity of 50.5%
and a specificity of 98.6% during cross-validation. In total, we
obtained approximately 900 predictions for each protein
(less than 1,000 because we only considered predictions in
which the protein was not used for training). The actual classifier decision as to whether a single protein is nucleolar or
not was a majority vote based on all approximately 900
predictions.

refereed research

We performed an analysis of nucleolar expression patterns
across 300 experimental conditions of the ROSETTA yeast
expression compendium [47]. We aimed to compare coexpression of genes within or between several functionally or
evolutionary related groups of genes. Therefore, we determined Pearson correlation coefficients for pairs of genes
within or between groups that were calculated from their
paired vectors of logarithmic expression ratios across different experimental conditions. We investigated groups that
were either identified during the preceding analysis (proteins
of the nucleolus, archaeal proteins of the nucleolus, nonarchaeal proteins of the nucleolus) or obtained from external
resources (the cytosolic ribosome components as recorded by
SGD and Gene Ontology [71], 90S processosome proteins
listed by Fromont-Racine et al. [3]). Histograms of correlation coefficients were determined for each group or group
cross-comparison to visualize the degree of co-regulation.
Additionally, the expression of genes encoding the cytosolic
ribosome and the 90S processosome were investigated using
the CLUSTER software (version 3.0). We performed a hierarchical clustering of the original logarithmic expression ratios
of these genes using the centroid method and the un-centered
correlation option. We visualized the results using the Java
Treeview software [69].

deposited research

In our implementation of BRH-based phylogenetic profiling
we used yeast proteins as queries to carry out BLASTP
searches [67] against each of the 84 proteomes. The best hits
for each yeast protein in the individual proteomes were
recorded. Then, we used those protein sequences that were
identified as best hits as queries in reciprocal BLAST searches
of the complete yeast proteome. For BLAST searches we used
default parameters (BLOSUM62 matrix, SEG filter on, gap
open penalty: 11, gap extension penalty: 1) and an expectation
(E) value threshold of E < 0.1. Only reciprocal best hits were
considered for the construction and visualization of phylogenetic profiles. For visualization, the E values of prokaryote-

For clustering of phylogenetic profiles, we obtained binary
(presence-absence/1 or 0) phylogenetic profiles for all nucleolar proteins of yeast identified here. These profiles were subjected to hierarchical clustering using the centroid method
and city-block distances using the software CLUSTER 3.0
[68]. The result helped us to identify sets of nucleolar proteins that stem from archaea, bacteria, or emerged late in
eukaryotes. We visualized the results using the Java Treeview
software [69] or our own phylogenetic profile viewer [70].

reports

We applied the 'best reciprocal hit' (BRH) method to find
orthologous protein pairs between the reference proteome
and a target proteome. The BRH method is an approximative
method for ortholog identification that has been applied by
many other groups before to identify orthologs for pairs of
organisms with considerable accuracy (see, for example, [6165]. The BRH method performs worse than more sophisticated phylogeny-based techniques (like reconciliation of phylogenetic and species tree), but, because of its simplicity, it is
especially suited for phylogenetic profiling of proteomes of
dozens of organisms. More advanced schemes based on pairwise sequence matching (for example, INPARANOID) are
also able to find so called 'in-paralogs' (paralogs in one organism that have to be called orthologous to a protein in a second
organism with equal right, because they emerged from a
duplication after the evolutionary split of these organisms).
For ortholog phylogenetic profiling, detection of such paralogs is not so important because the profile scores come from
the best hit anyway. Compared to clustering approaches for
ortholog identification (COG, orthoMCL), the BRH method
relies only on pairwise comparisons of a reference proteome
with target genomes and, therefore, more closely adheres to
the original definition of orthology, which is always defined
between two species. For a more detailed discussion of the
BRH method for phylogenetic profiling we refer to our recent
study [66].

Hierarchical clustering of gene expression patterns of ribosomal and processosomal protein genes. The central plot shows color-coded
expression ratios as supplied in the ROSETTA expression compendium [47] for genes encoding ribosomal and 90S-processosomal proteins. Genes vary
along the horizontal axis, expression experiments vary along the vertical axis. Top: 90S-processosomal genes are marked in black, ribosomal protein genes
are marked in white. Bottom: hierarchical clustering yields two large clusters, here marked in cyan and in yellow, that comprise approximately 80% of all
ribosomal/processosomal genes (171 of 211). Only genes of these clusters are shown here. Note that only three genes are not clustered according to
their membership to either the ribosome or the 90S processosome. The separation of the 90S processosomal and ribosomal protein genes by hierarchical
clustering (an unsupervised approach) confirms that the ribosomal and 90S processosomal expression programs are distinct from each other (Figure 5).
