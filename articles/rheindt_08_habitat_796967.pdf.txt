Abstract
Background: Little is known about the role ecological shifts play in the evolution of Neotropical
radiations that have colonized a variety of environments. We here examine habitat shifts in the
evolutionary history of Elaenia flycatchers, a Neotropical bird lineage that lives in a range of forest
and open habitats. We evaluate phylogenetic relationships within the genus based on mitochondrial
and nuclear DNA sequence data, and then employ parsimony-based and Bayesian methods to
reconstruct preferences for a number of habitat types and migratory behaviour throughout the
evolutionary history of the genus. Using a molecular clock approach, we date the most important
habitat shifts.
Results: Our analyses resolve phylogenetic relationships among Elaenia species and confirm
several species associations predicted by morphology while furnishing support for other taxon
placements that are in conflict with traditional classification, such as the elevation of various Elaenia
taxa to species level. While savannah specialism is restricted to one basal clade within the genus,
montane forest was invaded from open habitat only on a limited number of occasions. Riparian
growth may have been favoured early on in the evolution of the main Elaenia clade and subsequently
been deserted on several occasions. Austral long-distance migratory behaviour evolved on several
occasions.
Conclusion: Ancestral reconstructions of habitat preferences reveal pronounced differences not
only in the timing of the emergence of certain habitat preferences, but also in the frequency of
habitat shifts. The early origin of savannah specialism in Elaenia highlights the importance of this
habitat in Neotropical Pliocene and late Miocene biogeography. While forest in old mountain
ranges such as the Tepuis and the Brazilian Shield was colonized early on, the most important
colonization event of montane forest was in conjunction with Pliocene Andean uplift. Riparian
habitats may have played an important role in facilitating habitat shifts by birds expanding up the
mountains along streams and adapting to newly emerging montane forest habitat.

Background

Results

The major evolutionary mechanisms that have resulted in
the Neotropical Region's extremely large and diverse
fauna are not well understood. Most phylogenetic studies
have concentrated on radiations that have diversified
within Neotropical forests [1-9] and a few have dealt with
radiations centered in open habitats such as grasslands
and open scrub [10-13]. These studies have found that the
most recent speciation events have occurred between geographically isolated populations inhabiting the same habitat type, suggesting that allopatric isolation through
vicariance has been a dominant speciation mechanism
[1,3,6,9]. A limitation in extrapolating from these studies
is that most research has focussed on lineages that occur
in different microhabitats within one single habitat type
(e.g. terra firme forest, floodplain forest, montane forest).
Additionally, suitable methods for the reconstruction of
habitat preferences of ancestral lineages have been limited
until recently [14]. What is lacking is data on radiations
that include opposite ends of a spectrum of habitats, such
as dense forest and open savannah. Such studies will provide insights into the evolutionary significance of habitat
shifts following colonization of new habitats.

Genetic characterization
The aligned Fib5 sequences were 586 bp, 126 bp of which
were variable among our samples and 86 bp of which
emerged as parsimony-informative. We detected one 5-bp
deletion in the sequence of Capsiempis flaveola with respect
to the in-group as well as eight indels within the in-group,
five of which were parsimony-informative. Four parsimony-informative in-group indels could readily be
mapped onto our concatenated tree (see below) as a single gain. The remaining indel constituted a 1-bp deletion
in both samples of E. gigas, the sole sample of E. [obscura]
sordida and the Bolivian sample of E. flavogaster, and
required three independent gains. However, the phylogenetic utility of 1-bp deletions has previously been shown
to be low in tyrannids [17].

We investigated the evolutionary history of Neotropical
Elaenia flycatchers (Aves; Tyrannidae) using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences. This genus is distributed over a range of forest and open habitats from
Mexico and Hispaniola to the southern tip of South America [15,16] (Figure 1; Table 1). While largely avoiding
tropical lowland rainforest during the breeding season,
the genus is represented in a variety of other dense forest
habitats. In addition, the genus is widespread in scrubby
and open tree habitats in both the Neotropical highlands
and lowlands (Table 1). Austral long-distance migration is
well represented in the genus [15,16].

Chi-square tests of homogeneity of base frequencies
across taxa did not show any evidence for base compositional bias (data not shown). Pairwise uncorrected 'p'
divergences were calculated for both partitions and those
relevant for discussion are presented in Table 3. Saturation graphs with pairwise divergences plotted against the
number of transitions/transversions for Fib5 and for all
three codons of ND2 (not shown) did not reveal saturation.

Our study included samples of all but one currently recognised species (Table 2) and focused on the reconstruction
of ancestral habitat preferences using both parsimony and
Bayesian approaches. We traced the preferences for certain
habitat types throughout the evolutionary history of the
genus, namely forest, savannah, and riparian habitat, and
estimated relative rates of transition between the occupancy of those habitats. Additionally, we reconstructed
migratory behavior of the ancestors of Elaenia to trace the
origin of austral long-distance migration in the genus and
assess its role in the diversification of the genus. These
data, in addition to molecular clock dating of speciation
events, were then used to derive conclusions about modes
of speciation and the evolution of habitat preference in
Elaenia.

The ND2 partition comprised 1088 bp (incl. up to 47 bp
from the flanking tRNA-Met region), with 493 bp being
variable and 436 bp parsimony-informative. No anomalies were detected in the translations of the ND2 coding
gene, suggesting that the ND2 sequences were of mitochondrial origin.

Phylogenetic relationships
BI searches of the ND2 partition yielded the tree depicted
in Figure 2. The MP analysis arrived at a consensus topology that was fully congruent with the BI tree (parameters
listed in Table 4), although MP bootstrap support was
often lower than BI posterior probabilities (Figure 2).

Only a limited number of nodes received high support in
the MP and BI analyses of the Fib5 partition (tree parameters listed in Table 4). In all but one case, nodes supported by MP bootstrap (BS) values >80 were also
supported by BI posterior probabilities (PP) of 100 (Figure 3). None of the nodes supported by Fib5 was in conflict with nodes in the ND2 tree (Figure 2).
In view of the low level of topological conflict between
ND2 and Fib5 partitions, we opted to concatenate both
datasets. MP and BI searches of the concatenated dataset
yielded a well-resolved tree (Figure 3) that displayed
almost no conflict to any of the nodes recovered in the
ND2 and Fib5 analyses. The only exception involves the

unfolds once additional markers are added [17], and in

Data from references [15,16]

and BI analyses of the concatenated dataset, we suggest
that the position of E. gigas as depicted in Figure 3 reflects
the most likely hypothesis based on our data. As a consequence of the strong topological agreement between the
concatenated dataset and single partitions, phylogenetic
discussion will be based on the tree resulting from the
combined dataset (Figure 3).
Ecological parameters and timing
MP and BI reconstructions of ancestral migratory behavior
and preferences for habitat types are presented in Figure 4
and Figure 5 and are explained more thoroughly in the
Discussion. Transition rates between individual parameter states were not significant for any of the characters
examined (not shown).

The likelihood score of the most likely tree computed
under relaxed branch-length assumptions was not significantly different from that computed under conditions
that enforce a molecular clock (χ2 = 21.56, p = 0.36),
which suggests that a molecular clock is a reasonable
assumption for the evolution of Elaenia flycatchers as

sampled in this study (Figure 6). We estimated the ages of
Elaenia speciation events using a mitochondrial clock rate
of 2% sequence divergence/MY for reasons provided in
the Discussion. The temporal reconstruction of differentiation events in Elaenia is depicted in Figure 6.

Discussion
Phylogenetic relationships within Elaenia and taxonomic
conclusions
All analyses identified two primary clades: (1) the two
savannah specialists E. ruficeps and E. cristata which
received high posterior probability; and (2) the remaining
species with moderate Bayesian and parsimony support
(Figure 3). Within the large clade there was strong support
from the concatenated data for placing E. gigas as sister to
the rest, which contradicts vocal data and crest shape that
instead suggest a close relationship with E. flavogaster [16].

E. obscura, E. dayi and E. frantzii all lack the white coronal
patch present in most other Elaenia species, and consequently have been treated as a super-species complex by
some authorities [16]. While our data corroborate the pre-

sumed close relationship between E. obscura and E. dayi
[18], they strongly reject the inclusion of E. frantzii in this
complex. The mitochondrial divergences between Andean
E. o. obscura and Atlantic E. o. sordida are comparable to
those between sister species of Elaenia (e.g. E. spectabilis
and E. pelzelni; Table 3), and are ten times higher than
divergences within E. o. obscura sampled from along a
1500 km Andean transect. Furthermore, E. o. obscura and
E. o. sordida did not always form a monophyletic clade
with respect to E. dayi (Figure 3) and are best treated as
separate species: E. obscura and E. sordida.
Our analyses confirmed the genetic distinctness of E.
[chiriquensis] brachyptera with respect to E. [chiriquensis]
albivertex and their treatment as separate species (Rheindt
et al.: Cryptic speciation in the Lesser Elaenia Elaenia chiriquensis, submitted). Deep genetic divisions were also
observed in E. fallax. The level of ND2 divergence between
Jamaican E. f. fallax and Hispaniolan E. f. cherriei exceeded
that recorded between other species of Elaenia, suggesting
long-term separation and species-level treatment for E.
cherriei (Table 3; Figure 2).
E. parvirostris has usually been allied with E. albiceps, based
on vocal and morphological grounds, and apparent
hybridisation [16,19]. Both mitochondrial and nuclear
sequences placed the two in unrelated clades; E. parvirostris in a clade consisting primarily of migratory lowland
species, and E. albiceps in a clade with E. pallatangae (Figure 3). Given that E. parvirostris is also a lowland migratory species, its phylogenetic placement here is consistent
with its ecology. Furthermore, it also shares with other

members of this clade (E. spectabilis, E. pelzelni) three (as
opposed to the usual two) wing-bars. The placement of E.
parvirostris and E. albiceps in two relatively distant clades
calls for a re-examination of the potential hybrid zone in
southern Bolivia [19].
E. albiceps is also thought to hybridise with E. pallatangae
[18]. The five recognised subspecies of E. pallatangae are
distributed over two discrete South American land areas:
the Andes and the Venezuelan Tepuis (Figure 1). All our
Venezuelan samples (E. [p.] olivina) formed a distinct
clade closely related to a number of Central American and
Caribbean Elaenia species, while the Andean samples (E.
pallatangae sensu stricto) emerged in a clade with E. albiceps
and were scarcely distinguishable from the latter in both
mitochondrial and nuclear DNA (Figure 3). Clearly, more
detailed sampling is needed to resolve this unusual phylogenetic pattern. Future research may reveal that E. albiceps and E. pallatangae sensu stricto may be conspecific, or
that genetic introgression has accounted for their similar
mitochondrial DNA, and the current taxonomic status of
the latter two forms is best retained until such studies have
been conducted. Nevertheless, the phylogenetic divergence between E. [p.] pallatangae and E. [p.] olivina on
both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA indicates treatment
of E. olivina as a species that is not particularly closely
related to Andean E. pallatangae.
Some reasonably deep mitochondrial divergence was
found between the Cayman Island subspecies caymanensis
of E. martinica and the other two subspecies investigated
(Table 3). In contrast, samples of E. martinica riisii from
Puerto Rico and E. m. martinica from St. Vincent were
barely distinguishable from one another on ND2 divergences (Table 3). This suggests a close affinity of the latter
two subspecies, which are geographically linked through
the Lesser Antillean island chain. The Cayman Island race
is geographically isolated, with sequence divergences typical of distinct tyrannid subspecies [17].
Habitat shifts in the evolutionary history of Elaenia
Our reconstructions of ancestral habitat requirements
revealed pronounced differences not only in the timing of
the emergence of certain habitat preferences, but also in
the frequency of habitat shifts (Figure 4). In the following,
we will examine these habitat shifts individually for each
habitat considered.
Savannah
Elaenia includes two habitat specialists (E. ruficeps and E.
cristata) that are closely tied to the occurrence of natural
savannah and cerrado. Our DNA phylogeny (Figure 3)
united these two in a clade that was sister to the remaining
species of Elaenia. Zimmer [18] also identified features of
the wing formula and nostril structure that separated E.

ruficeps and E. cristata from the rest of the genus. Three
other species regionally breed in savannah habitat,
though they are more generalist in nature and occur in
other habitat types as well (Table 1). E. flavogaster and E.
chiriquensis are widespread denizens of a variety of open
habitats, while E. dayi is primarily a forest bird that also
breeds in stunted tree savannah within its restricted range
in the Venezuelan Tepuis [15,16]. These facultative savannah inhabitants did not form a clade and were positioned
in different assemblages.
The finding that savannah specialists are sister to the rest
of Elaenia suggests that savannah would have constituted
an important part of the Neotropical landscape during the
early diversification of the genus. Although parameter
state reconstructions are either equivocal (MP) or argue
against (BI) a savannah-inhabiting ancestor of Elaenia,
savannah is likely to have been invaded by proto-ruficeps/
cristata shortly after the initial divergence of Elaenia (Figure 4).
Forest interior
Elaenia is widely distributed throughout Neotropical edge
habitats and other open vegetation and avoids tropical
lowland rainforests [15,16]. Nevertheless, a number of
species are found primarily or secondarily in the interior
of montane or otherwise temperate forest (Table 1). Even
though nine species inhabit forest, both Bayesian and parsimony state reconstructions showed that occurrence in
forest interior arose on only two or three (maximally four)
occasions (Figure 4). Within these assemblages of forestinhabiting species, the prevailing pattern is one of allopatric distributions (Figure 1). This is consistent with the
notion that geographical isolation rather than ecological
divergence is the most common mode of speciation in
Neotropical birds [1,3,6,9].

Riparian habitats
Almost half of the species of Elaenia are either narrowly
confined to riparian vegetation or have a regional preference for it. Riparian habitat preferences can vary widely
from montane streamside habitat (e.g. E. strepera) to
Cecropia stands on Amazonian river-islands (E. pelzelni),
but a frequent commonality of these habitats is that they
constitute breaks in blocks of closed forest habitat or
savannah/cerrado. Both MP and BI reconstructions indicated that an association with riparian growth may have
been prevalent in the main lineage of Elaenia in very early
stages of its diversification and may have been lost on at
least two to four occasions (Figure 4). Two of these secondary losses of riparian association involve lineages that
subsequently colonized forest interior where they diversified extensively (the E. obscura/dayi complex and the
"montane forest clade" of Figure 3). River and stream
association may have provided an evolutionary vehicle for
lowland species of open habitat to move up the streams
and colonize montane forest. This notion is further supported by the fact that the most basal riparian species E.
gigas (Figure 3) is confined to the Andean foothills while
many subsequent speciation events gave rise to lineages
that occur in elevationally higher regions.

It is intriguing that although the ancestor of Elaenia was
able to colonize montane forest, it never gained a foothold in tropical lowland forest. Brumfield and Edwards
[3] suggested that competitive interspecific interactions
may limit colonization potential in the evolution of Neotropical suboscines. Accordingly, Elaenia may have been
able to exploit new montane forests formed by mountain
uplift, while being excluded from the older lowland forests through competitive interactions with other flycatchers.
Evolutionary history of migratory behavior in Elaenia
Some species of Elaenia are austral migrants that breed in
the temperate zone of the southern Neotropics and move

to the tropics in the austral winter (Table 1). Such migratory behavior is ordinarily displayed by the entire species
(E. spectabilis, E. parvirostris, E. strepera), though in E. albiceps only the southern race E. a. chilensis migrates while
more northerly races are sedentary. In addition, Elaenia
contains five "partially migratory species" that are seden-

tary over most parts of their range but do exhibit short-distance migratory behavior in some of their more temperate
populations (Table 1). MP and BI reconstructions both
indicated a sedentary ancestor of Elaenia with migratory
and partial migratory behavior arising several times (Figure 5). This result is in agreement with Joseph et al.'s [20]

phylogenetic analysis of migratory behavior in Myiarchus
flycatchers. The fact that austral long-distance migration
exists in some populations of species that are otherwise
sedentary, and the high incidence of partial migration in
Elaenia species, suggest that migratory behavior is evolutionarily labile in tyrannids.
From our phylogenetic reconstructions there is one possible example of speciation resulting from loss of migratory
behaviour. E. pelzelni is the only sedentary habitat specialist of a clade that comprises either migratory or partially
migratory habitat generalists (Figures 3, 4). Although neither mode of reconstruction unequivocally identified an
austral migratory ancestor to this clade, ecological evi-

dence suggests that E. pelzelni is likely derived from an austral migrant ancestor. E. pelzelni has very specific habitat
requirements (river-island habitat along the Amazon),
and considering the migratory generalist life histories of
all other members of this clade, it is very unlikely for the
ancestor of E. pelzelni and E. spectabilis to have been a sedentary specialist. Though dispersing widely, wintering
populations of E. spectabilis avoid the interior of tropical
rainforest, frequenting instead marginal and riparian habitats. An ancestor with a similar behaviour could therefore
have easily given rise to a sedentary riparian E. pelzelni.

The timing of Elaenia diversification
Dating of evolutionary events has presented major difficulties in phylogeographic studies of birds. The sparse
avian fossil record (especially of songbirds) complicates
the assessment of the age of certain lineages. Instead, phylogeneticists have resorted to the notion of a molecular
clock to date speciation events (for a summary, see
[21,22]). However, the constancy and universality of a traditional avian mitochondrial molecular clock of c. 2%
divergence/MY has been questioned [21-23], and rate
constancy has been contradicted by Bayesian reconstructions using calibrations at the level of avian orders and
vertebrate classes [24]. Nevertheless, a large number of
avian clock calibrations provided for phylogeographic
studies at the genus level seem to converge at around 2%/
MY (e.g. [25-28]). More importantly, Weir and Schluter
[29] used cross-validation techniques to compare 90 candidate avian clock calibrations dating back overwhelmingly to the genus level and found strong support for a
2.1%/MY clock rate constant over the last 12 MY and universal across twelve bird orders. In tyrannid flycatchers in
particular, Rheindt et al. (The timing of Neotropical speciation dynamics: a reconstruction of Myiopagis flycatcher
diversification using phylogenetic and paleogeographic
data, submitted) compared mitochondrial molecular
clock rates from the literature with paleogeographic calibrations of ND2 sequences within a closely related elaeniid flycatcher genus (Myiopagis), and found that the
traditional avian molecular clock of 2% mtDNA divergence/MY is a reasonable assumption for elaeniid ND2
sequences. Based on these considerations, we have used a
mitochondrial clock rate of 2%/MY to date speciation
events in Elaenia (Figure 6). We emphasize that these dating estimates can only be viewed as an approximation,
and we only discuss them in the rough timeframe of earthhistorical epochs.

According to our reconstructions, the earliest divergences
occurred in rapid succession in the late Miocene (c. 8.5 to
5.3 MYA). Arising during this period were the two savannah specialists as well as E. gigas, E. strepera, the E. obscura/
dayi complex, the migratory lowland clade (Figure 2), and
the lineage comprising all the remaining species. The
Amazon lowlands at that time were intermittently
flooded by "Lago Amazonas", an extensive spatially and
temporally variable freshwater lake system that drained
into the Caribbean (see [30] and references therein). The
landscape constituted "...a vast complex of shallow megalakes surrounded by swampy grassland savanna..." interspersed with forest (p. 206 in [30]). Such a dynamic
savannah-forest landscape with water barriers rapidly
changing in extent was likely conducive for vicariant speciation events such as those that led to the two savannah
specialists and the migratory lowland lineage (Figure 3).
The Andes at that time were only about a third to half of

their current elevation [31,32]. Consequently, the montane Elaenia lineages that had emerged by that time were
either Andean foothill species (e.g. E. gigas) as opposed to
Andean highland species, or were clades from ancient
Neotropical mountain shields such as E. dayi from the
Tepuis or E. sordida from the Brazilian Shield, which may
have given rise to Andean E. obscura at a much later date.
With the onset of the Pliocene at c. 5 MYA, there was a second wave of speciation events which commenced with the
differentiation of the lowland migratory clade (Figure 3)
into its three main lineages, two of which include austral
breeders that annually migrate into the tropics (E. parvirostris and E. spectabilis). This and a similar lowland speciation event between E. mesoleuca and the E. chiriquensis
complex fell within a period of global warming [33-39]
and concomitant sea level rises of up to 80 m [40] which
led to pronounced marine incursions into the Río de la
Plata Basin in the south and the Amazon in the north.
Such marine incursions or the continuing spatio-temporal
dynamics of Lago Amazonas further inland, or a combination thereof, were presumably the driving forces for these
lowland speciation events.
The mid to late Pliocene from c. 4 MYA onwards sees the
emergence and rapid differentiation of the "montane forest clade" (Figure 3), giving rise to a suite of highland species. This coincides with a period of rapid Andean uplift
between 5 and 2 MYA [31]. The Central American mountains were colonized by E. frantzii immediately after the
closure of the Panamanian isthmus at c. 3.5 MYA [41,42].
Starting around the same time, the Caribbean was
invaded by E. fallax, E. cherriei and E. martinica, though we
are unable to specify whether one or two colonization
events were involved. Dispersal must certainly have
played a role in the diversification of the montane clade,
as neither the Caribbean islands nor the Venezuelan
Tepuis (colonized by E. olivina) have ever been connected
to the Andes. The Andes likely played a role in isolating
the Chocó endemic E. brachyptera from cis-Andean E. chiriquensis around the late Pliocene.

Conclusion
Our ancestral reconstructions of habitat preferences in
Elaenia reveal pronounced differences not only in the timing of the emergence of certain habitat preferences, but
also in the frequency of habitat shifts. Savannah specialism has an early origin in the genus, which highlights the
importance of this habitat in Neotropical Pliocene and
late Miocene biogeography. Forest in old mountain
ranges such as the Tepuis and the Brazilian Shield was colonized early on with limited subsequent in-situ differentiation, while the most important colonization event of
montane forest was in conjunction with Pliocene Andean
uplift and led to a rapid allopatric diversification. Riparian

habitats may have played an important role in facilitating
the colonization of new habitats by enabling birds to
expand up the mountains along streams and to adapt to
newly emerging montane forest habitat. We also confirm
austral long-distance migration to be a labile trait in Neotropical songbirds.

Methods
Sampling regime and laboratory techniques
We investigated one mitochondrial coding gene region,
NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 (ND2), and one nuclear
intron, β-fibrinogen intron 5 (Fib5). Tissue samples were
obtained for all but one currently recognized species of
Elaenia, as E. ridleyana, endemic to the tiny island of Fernando de Noronha in the Atlantic Ocean, was not available
for inclusion. Sampling focussed on obtaining a large geographic and subspecific coverage of Elaenia species. In
addition to the 64 specimens sampled in the present
study, sequence data were sourced from the literature for
a further nine samples (see Table 2), thereby totalling 18
species. Specimen information and Genbank accession
numbers are provided in Table 2. For outgroup comparisons we used Capsiempis flaveola [43] (Genbank accession
numbers

DQ294563
and
DQ294475
), as it has a close affinity to Elaenia [17].
Extraction and sequencing techniques followed Rheindt
et al. [17]. ND2 sequences were obtained for all 73
ingroup samples, while the Fib5 dataset was restricted to
47 samples. Alignment and editing of sequences was carried out using SEQUENCHER v.4.1.4 (Gene Codes Corp.,
Ann Arbor, Michigan). Coding sequences were translated
and checked for anomalous substitution patterns, such as
double peaks and stop codons. All sequences were manually edited and assessed for deviant base composition.
Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic analysis of the separate data partitions as
well as the concatenated dataset was carried out using
maximum parsimony (MP) and Bayesian inference (BI).
Indels were excised from the dataset on account of their
low number and short lengths, but the parsimonyinformative ones were later mapped onto the tree. For MP
analysis, we ran heuristic searches (default settings activated unless otherwise specified) using the program
PAUP* v4.0b10 [44]. Tree searches were unweighted as
there was no evidence of saturation (see Results). PAUP*
was also employed for estimating partition and sequence

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/193

parameters. All PAUP* analyses involved 100 bootstrap
replicates.
For BI analysis, the hierarchical likelihood ratio test
implemented in the program MODELTEST 3.06 [45] was
run to recover an appropriate evolutionary model for each
partition (Table 4). MRBAYES 3.1 [46] was run with
default settings (unless otherwise specified) using the
basic parameters determined by MODELTEST, while
allowing for the estimation of model-specific parameters
such as base frequencies or gamma shape [p. 56 in ref
[47]]. The analysis of the concatenated dataset was conducted with separate evolutionary model settings for each
partition. BI searches employed Metropolis-coupled
Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling with one cold and
three heated chains running for 1 million generations
with a sampling frequency of 100. The burn-in period was
determined graphically following Ronquist et al. [47] and
samples within this period were discarded (Table 4). Subsequently, posterior probabilities were derived from the
50% majority rule consensus of all trees retained.
Ancestral character state reconstruction
Ecological parameters were mapped onto the tree topology derived from the concatenated dataset (with specieslevel lineages reduced to one representative) as discrete
characters using life-history information from Ridgely and
Tudor [15] and Hosner [16]. Transition rates between
individual parameter states were also calculated. Four ecological parameters were mapped. (a) Breeding occurrence
in forest interior (yes/no). Species that mainly breed in
forest edge were not included; (b) Breeding occurrence in
natural savannahs and cerrado vegetation (yes/no). Species ranging in similar open habitat of anthropogenic origin were not included. (c) At least regional breeding
occurrence in riparian habitats such as gallery forest, Amazonian river-islands, riparian successional zones, Andean
and pre-Andean streamside and similar habitats (yes/no).
(d) Migratory status (austral long-distance migrants, partial/short-distance migrants or sedentary species). This
character was frequently double-coded, since all species
that have partially migratory populations are sedentary
throughout most of their range, and one species (E. albiceps) includes both sedentary montane populations and
austral long-distance migrants.

For state reconstruction of these parameters, we employed
an MP-based approach [48] as implemented in the program MACCLADE[49]. MP analysis assumed unordered
states. Character states were also mapped using the proin
the
computer
package
gram
MULTISTATE
BAYESTRAITS[14]. The Bayesian method generates posterior
probabilities for ancestral character states to gauge estimation reliability. BI analyses were run for 1,000,000 iterations with a tree sampling rate of 1,000 and a burn-in of

Page 16 of 18

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:193

50,000 iterations. We employed a uniform hyperprior to
obtain a suitable prior for Bayesian runs assuming an
exponential distribution. Posterior probabilities for character states were recorded for relevant nodes, and character transition rates were estimated.
Molecular clock estimates
PAUP* was used in conjunction with the evolutionary
model specified by MODELTEST 3.06 for our ND2 partition (Table 4) to compute maximum-likelihood scores for
the most likely tree under the enforcement of a molecular
clock and under relaxed branch length assumptions. For
computational efficiency the ND2 dataset was reduced to
one representative per species-level lineage. Likelihood
scores were compared with a χ2-test (df = 20) to see
whether they differed significantly. We refrained from
using the concatenated dataset for this analysis, because
the molecular clock rate used in this study (2% divergence/MY) is based on mitochondrial DNA (see Discussion for rationale).
