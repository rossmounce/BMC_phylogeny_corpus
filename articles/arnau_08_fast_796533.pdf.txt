Abstract
Background: The comparison of DNA sequences is a traditional problem in genomics and
bioinformatics. Many new opportunities emerge due to the improvement of personal computers,
allowing the implementation of novel strategies of analysis.
Findings: We describe a new program, called UVWORD, which determines the number of times
that each DNA word present in a sequence (target) is found in a second sequence (source), a
procedure that we have called oligonucleotide profiling. On a standard computer, the user may
search for words of a size ranging from k = 1 to k = 14 nucleotides. Average counts for groups of
contiguous words may also be established. The rate of analysis on standard computers is from 3.4
(k = 14) to 16 millions of words per second (1 ≤ k ≤ 8). This makes feasible the fast screening of
even the longest known DNA molecules.
Discussion: We show that the combination of the ability of analyzing words of relatively long size,
which occur very rarely by chance, and the fast speed of the program allows to perform novel types
of screenings, complementary to those provided by standard programs such as BLAST. This
method can be used to determine oligonucleotide content, to characterize the distribution of
repetitive sequences in chromosomes, to determine the evolutionary conservation of sequences in
different species, to establish regions of similar DNA among chromosomes or genomes, etc.

Findings
There are a few qualitatively different types of analyses of
DNA sequences. First, we find methods to detect similarity, often to generate pairwise or multiple alignments (e.
g. those implemented in BLAST, CLUSTALX, etc.). A second type of analysis is dedicated to discover patterns of
conserved motifs in multiple sequences (e. g. MEME). A
third characteristic class includes the programs implementing phylogenetic analyses of DNA data (e. g. MEGA4,
PAUP). Finally, a fourth significant class involves alignment-free sequence comparisons (reviewed in [1]). Many
of the methods included in this fourth class depend on

the analysis of the frequencies of different "words" of
nucleotides. Word analysis has contributed to determine
fundamental aspects in genomics, such as compositional
biases among chromosomes or genomes, asymmetries
between the strands of the double helix, biases in codon
usage, patterns of DNA methylation diminishing CG
dinucleotides, discovery of binding sites for transcription
factors, etc. (reviewed in [2]). It is thus of great interest to
have fast, flexible tools for exhaustive exploration of DNA
words at a genomic scale. A problem of this type of analysis is how to generate algorithms able to compile and
store the information for the large amounts of different

words arising when large values of k, the word length, are
used. One solution is to use complex preprocessing of the
data and then fast multiprocessor machines, which allow
for exhaustive explorations of words of any size at a
genomic scale (e. g. [3-5]). These approaches have the
obvious drawbacks that not all potential users may have
access to parallel equipment. Moreover, each platform
requires adjustments of the programs [5]. In fact, most
users interested in word genome analysis would benefit
from programs able to rapidly scan for relatively short
words on standard computer equipment. Studies that
exhaustively characterize words in chromosomes or full
genomes generally search for sequences of sizes 1 ≤ k ≤ 6
(e. g. [6-9]). Studies that look for all words of longer sizes
are scarce (e. g. [10-14], for words up to k = 11). Only
analyses focused on the detection of one or a few related
sequences, binding sites for transcription factors or regulatory elements upstream of the genes, explore even
longer words, generally up to 15 nucleotides long (e. g.
refs. [6,15-18]).
Oligonucleotide profiling using UVWORD
Here we describe a new program, UVWORD, which
implements a strategy of analysis that we have called oligonucleotide profiling. It consists in establishing the frequencies in which all the oligonucleotides detected in a
particular sequence ("target sequence") are present in a
second sequence ("source sequence"). The method is as
follows: UVWORD first searches for words of size 1 ≤ k ≤
14 present in the source sequence and determines their
frequencies by using a sliding-window approach, moving
one nucleotide in each step. Then, the program reads all
words present in the target sequence. Finally, it associates
each of the words in the target sequence with their corresponding frequencies in the source sequence. The user

may ask the program to add together the frequencies for a
number of adjacent positions in the target sequence. This
is implemented in a a parameter that we have called range
(R). The R value allows the user to choose between "fine
grain" (typically R = 1; i. e. individual counts) and broad
regional comparisons. For the latter, R values up to 105 –
106 (i. e. counts for 105 or 106 adjacent words) may be
used. This is convenient when the target sequences are
very long (see below). The program works at extremely
fast speeds: from 3.4 (k = 14) to 16 (1 ≤ k ≤ 8) millions of
words per second on a PC computer with a 2.8 GHz Intel
Pentium 4 processor and 2 Gb RAM.
We became interested in developing this program when
we noticed that oligonucleotide profiling allows to perform types of analysis that are conceptually very different
(Table 1). First, if we use a single sequence as both source
and target, UVWORD will simply provide the user with
the frequency of all the words present in that sequence. In
this case, UVWORD is equivalent to other programs used
to just count oligonucleotides. However, source and target
sequences may be different and that allows for several
interesting alternative analyses that cannot be performed
with related programs. For example, if the source is large
(e. g. whole chromosomes or even whole genomes) while
the target is a short motif, UVWORD will provide the frequency in the long source sequence of all the words
present in the motif. This may be useful to determine the
degree of repetition in a chromosome of the words that
compose a particular short sequence (e. g. to detect patterns of internal repeats in a satellite sequence, evolutionary conservation of sequences, etc). On the other hand,
the inverse analysis (i.e. the source is a short motif and the
target is a chromosome) allows, if the target sequence is
divided into parts, to determine the distribution of the

involving eukaryotic chromosomes are detailed. If small eukaryotic chromosomes or bacterial genomes are analyzed, the most
convenient k and R values may be smaller. When two or more sources are used, results are obtained independently and then
compared. Some examples are shown in detail in the supplementary information (Supplementary figures 1 – 5).

sequences present in the motif along the chromosome.
Two large molecules can also be compared and their
degree of general similarity can be established, both at a
local scale and globally (see details in Table 1). As we will
show in some biological examples, and it is also summarized in Table 1, most of these analyses cannot be performed unless words of sufficiently large size (typically k
= 10), which generate sequences expected to occur very
rarely by chance, are used.
UVWORD was written in C and it is compiled for Microsoft Windows and Linux operating systems. Its algorithm
is very simple. First, a word of size k is read from the
source sequence and the program computes for that word
a hash value: each of the nucleotides in a word is converted using a two-bits binary code (A = 00, C = 01, G =
10, T = 11) into a number. Each particular word has thus
an associated binary number or its corresponding decimal
number. Consequently, 4k different decimal numbers
serve to represent all possible nucleotide sequences of size
k. These decimal numbers are used as pointers to address
a table of frequencies, in which a counter increases when
a particular DNA word is found. This process is sequentially repeated for each nucleotide, until the source
sequence is fully read in its 5' – 3' direction. After the
source is analyzed, the program reads each word in the
target file and searches for those words in the table of frequencies derived from the source sequence. UVWORD
may exhaustively analyze words of size 1 ≤ k ≤ 14 on a PC
computer with at least 1.25 Gb RAM, or 1 ≤ k ≤ 13, with
512 Mb RAM.
In order to use UVWORD, the sequences must be written
in two standard text (.txt) or fasta (.fa) format files. Any
comments or symbols other than A, C, G, T will be properly detected and skipped by the program. The program
requires only two parameters, the word size k and the
range, R (see above). Using these parameters, the program
generates the results and writes them into a file (.out) of
columns separated by tabs, which can be readily imported
to other programs for further analysis or graphical representation.
Biological examples
We have generated a few selected examples, described in
detail in the supplementary information of this article [see
Additional file 1]. They include 1) Characterization of the
structure and location of X-specific satellites on the Drosophila melanogaster X chromosome; 2) Conservation of
words in Alu repetitive sequences in human and chimpanzee; 3) Relative frequencies of Alu sequences in
human and chimpanzee; 4) Distribution of CG dinucleotides, Alu and LINE1 elements in human and chimpanzee chromosomes; and, 5) Comparison of general profiles
for human chromosomes 21 and 22 (details in Supple-

mentary figures 1 – 5 [see Additional file 1]). A first paper
of our group using this methodology has been recently
published [19].

Discussion and conclusion
It is often overlooked that the improvement of computer
equipment confers well-known "brute force" methods the
ability of providing qualitatively new types of information. The results that we have shown are good examples of
how the extension of a classical type of analysis, which
involves counting short words in DNA sequences, may be
used in novel contexts. Here, that extension depends on
two novel features. The main novelty in our approach is
what characterizes the oligonucleotide profiling strategy:
data from two sequences, one that provides the words to
be analyzed (target) and a second sequence in which the
number of times that those words are present is counted
(source), are combined. The second significant feature is
that most of the interesting analyses depend on the ability
of exhaustively count all the words of size k = 10 in very
long DNA sequences (see Table 1). This would have been
a daunting task for a personal computer just a few years
ago. Now, we routinely use k = 13 for most of these
searches. There are two reasons for choosing this particular word size, especially to analyze long chromosomes.
First, sequences of 13 nucleotides are already extremely
specific. In a random sequence, we expect to find each
word of size k = 13 just once every 67 millions of words.
This means that if we search for a particular 13-mer, characteristic of a given sequence, in even the longest eukaryotic chromosomes, the number of false positives –
sequences that will be identical by chance to the one that
we are looking for – is expected to be very low. The second
reason to prefer k = 13 to other sizes such as k = 12 or even
k = 14, which can also be used with our current version of
UVWORD, is that 13 is a prime number. This fact contributes to avoiding systematic patterns that may increase the
noise, associated to the presence above expectation of particular dinucleotides, trinucleotides (some typically
enriched in coding regions), etc.
The information that can be extracted from an UVWORD
output is often more precise or useful than the mere establishment of similarity or the localization of sequences
similar to a query that can be distilled from the output of
a BLAST search. In fact, oligonucleotide searches and
BLAST searches are complementary. For example, BLAST
searches allow for a fast quantification of the number and
localization of repetitive sequences and, by the fact that
mismatches are allowed in the detection of similarity,
they are clearly superior to UVWORD searches unless very
short, identical oligonucleotides are sought. However, oligonucleotide profiling is clearly superior for establishing
the degree of conservation in repetitive sequences (e. g.
Supplementary figures 1A, 2 [see Additional file 1]),

which would be very arduous to infer from BLAST
searches. It is also clearly superior to establish the patterns
of global similarity among chromosomes (Supplementary
figures 4, 5 [see Additional file 1]), that cannot be so readily explored using BLAST. The detection of singular
sequences or patterns is also simpler using UVWORD (e.
g. Supplementary figure 3 [see Additional file 1]).
In summary, we think that the oligonucleotide profiling
strategy implemented in UVWORD can be useful to all
researchers interested in exploring nucleotide sequences
for significant patterns. Our program has, in addition of
its versatility, all the advantages that we may ask before
deciding to add a new program to our arsenal: it does not
require additional, expensive computer equipment, it can
cope with the largest available sequences, it is very fast and
it is extremely simple to use. Its simplicity allows modifications of UVWORD for particular uses to be tailor-made
quite easily. For instance, we developed a version focused
on the automatic determination of sequences that were
very frequent in a chromosome and absent in another
chromosome [20]. The program can also be easily modified to perform related tasks, for example, to generate
chaos game representation of sequences [10,13,21].
