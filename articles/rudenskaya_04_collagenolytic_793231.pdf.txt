Abstract
Background: In this paper, we describe cDNA cloning of a new anionic trypsin and a
collagenolytic serine protease from king crab Paralithodes camtschaticus and the elucidation of their
primary structures. Constructing the phylogenetic tree of these enzymes was undertaken in order
to prove the evolutionary relationship between them.
Results: The mature trypsin PC and collagenolytic protease PC contain 237 (Mcalc 24.8 kDa) and
226 amino acid residues (Mcalc 23.5 kDa), respectively. Alignments of their amino acid sequences
revealed a high degree of the trypsin PC identity to the trypsin from Penaeus vannamei
(approximately 70%) and of the collagenolytic protease PC identity to the collagenase from fiddler
crab Uca pugilator (76%). The phylogenetic tree of these enzymes was constructed.
Conclusions: Primary structures of the two mature enzymes from P. camtschaticus were obtained
and compared with those of other proteolytic proteins, including some enzymes from brachyurans.
A phylogenetic analysis was also carried out. These comparisons revealed that brachyurins are
closely related to their vertebrate and bacterial congeners, occupy an intermediate position
between them, and their study significantly contributes to the understanding of the evolution and
function of serine proteases.

Background
King crab collagenolytic serine protease PC [1] and trypsin
PC [2] are brachyurins (MEROPS [3] peptidase classification: CLAN SA, family S1; NC-IUBMB enzyme classification: EC 3.4.21.32). Brachyurin is a term recommended by
NC-IUBMB in 1992 for serine endopeptidases of a distinctive type found in crabs and their relatives. The name is
derived from brachyurans, the phylogenetic subgroup of
"true" crabs, which are a common source of these
enzymes [4]. Early examples of the enzyme family include
fiddler crab collagenase I [5], crayfish trypsin [6,7] and

shrimp trypsin [8]. Other serine proteases were isolated
from krill [9], crabs [10,11], crayfish [12], shrimps [1317], and lobster [18]. There are at least three types of
brachyurins: (Ia) the enzymes with a broad specificity,
whose activities for synthetic substrates are similar to
those of trypsin (Arg, Lys), chymotrypsin (Phe, Leu) and
elastase (Ala, Leu) [9,16,19-21]; (Ib) broadly specific
enzymes devoid of trypsin-like activity; and (II) the
enzymes with a strict trypsin-like specificity (Arg, Lys)
[10,13]. When preparing this article, we knew the amino
acid sequences of six mature brachyurins: crab collagenase

I [19,21], two crayfish trypsins [7,12], shrimp chymotrypsins I and II [22], and a shrimp trypsin [17]. The
sequences encoding all the enzymes, except for crayfish
trypsin, have been cloned.
In recent years, our laboratory has been engaged in the
investigation of proteases from the Kamchatka king crab
(P. camtschaticus) [1,2,23-25]. A number of proteases were
isolated from the crab hepatopancreas. They are capable
of collagen and fibrin lysis and are shown to exhibit a
wound-healing activity in treatment of burns, trophic
ulcers, and postoperative scars [24]. A homogeneous collagenolytic protease PC [1] and trypsin PC [2] were isolated from the king crab hepatopancreas using ionexchange and affinity chromatographies.
In this article, we describe the construction of cDNA
library from the total RNA of king crab P. camtschaticus
and the isolation and sequencing of genes encoding
trypsin PC and collagenolytic serine protease PC. We also
compare here the primary structures of the enzymes with
those of other serine proteases from invertebrate and vertebrate species. The evolution of crab trypsin and collagenase are examined by constructing a phylogenetic tree.

Results and discussion
Structural features of king crab brachyurins
The coding sequences of collagenolytic protease PC and
trypsin PC were cloned and their amino acid sequences
were established. An analysis of their nucleotide
sequences suggests that the gene products are initially synthesized as precursor proteins, which are subsequently
processed to the mature enzymes. The deduced protein
sequence of collagenolytic protease PC consists of 270 residues and includes initiation Met, a 15-aa signal peptide,
a 29-aa precursor peptide, and the active enzyme. The
deduced protein sequence of trypsin PC comprises 266 aa
and includes Met, derived from the initiation methionine
codon, a 15-aa signal peptide, a 14-aa precursor peptide,
and the mature enzyme. A comparison of the brachyurin
propeptides additionally characterizes the enzyme group,
because the propeptides have variable lengths and negligible identity. Crab collagenolytic protease PC, collagenase I, shrimp chymotrypsins I and II, and shrimp
trypsin are derived from propeptides that are longer (29–
44 residues) than those of the vertebrate proteases (8–15
residues). The function of these large activation domains
is unclear, since they are unnecessary for the heterologous
expression of proteases from vertebrates. The activation
site of procollagenase PC (Val-Lys-Ser-Gln-Arg-Ile-ValGly-Gly) is closer to those of chymotrypsinogen (Ser-GlyLeu-Ser-Arg-Ile-Val-Val-Gly) and proelastase (Glu-ThrAsn-Ala-Arg-Val-Val-Gly-Gly), which are activated by
trypsin, than to that of trypsinogen (Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-LysIle-Val-Gly-Gly), which is activated by enteropeptidase

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/4/2

[26]. Interestingly, the identical activation sites of trypsin
PC and shrimp trypsin (Arg-Gly-Leu-Asn-Lys-Ile-Val-GlyGly) are also devoid of an enteropeptidase site. This suggests that the activation cascades of the vertebrate digestive proteases have significantly diverged from those of
crustaceans. Brachyurins may be self-activated, or other
trypsin-like proteases in the hepatopancreas may fulfill
this function.
The mature collagenolytic protease PC contains 226 aa
residues (which corresponds to its molecular mass of
23555 Da) and includes the active site residues His41
(57), Asp87 (102) and Ser179 (195), which are involved
in the catalytic mechanisms of all serine proteases. The
residue numbers in parentheses refer to topological equivalences in the classical nomenclature of chymotrypsinlike serine proteases. The sequences near these residues
are highly conserved. Six half-cystinyl residues were found
in king crab collagenolytic protease PC, which is comparable to six half-cystinyl residues in Uca pugilator brachyurin and ten half-cystinyl residues in chymotrypsinogen
[27]. These residues probably form disulfide bonds
Cys42–Cys58, Cys168–Cys182, and Cys191–Cys220,
identical to three of four disulfide bonds in chymotrypsin
(Cys42–Cys58, Cys168–Cys182, and Cys191–Cys220).
In chymotrypsin, Ser189 forms the bottom of the substrate-binding pocket. The king crab collagenase has Gly
in this position. At the upper part of the binding pocket,
where chymotrypsin contains a Gly residue (Gly226),
crab collagenase contains an Asp residue. An alignment of
the amino acid sequences of the brachyurin collagenase
from U. pugilator [28] and the collagenolytic protease PC
reveals an unusual distribution of negative charges in their
specific primary structures: they have a lower number of
basic (six His and five Arg) than acidic residues (24) (Fig.
1). A low isoelectric point of collagenolytic protease PC
(3.0) reflects this characteristic of the enzyme. Brachyurin
from U. pugilator [21] also contains four His, four Arg, and
only one Lys in contrast to 25 acidic residues, whereas
chymotrypsin A has 16 acidic residues and 19 basic residues and its pI = 7.0.
The mature trypsin PC contains 237 aa residues, which
corresponds to its molecular mass of 24804 Da. The N-terminal amino sequence of the active enzyme, Ile-Val-GlyGly, is highly conserved in all trypsins. Multiple sequence
alignments of trypsins are shown in Fig 2. They demonstrate that the residues forming the charge relay system in
the active site of king crab trypsin [His41 (57), Asp87
(102) and Ser179 (195)] and the highly conserved
sequences near these residues are the same in the corresponding regions of other serine proteases. Residue numbers in parentheses refer to topological equivalences in
the classical nomenclature of chymotrypsin-like serine
proteases. The primary (S1) binding pocket of all trypsins

is strictly conserved; it includes Asp102 responsible for the
interaction with the side chain of Arg or Lys (P1) residue
of substrate. The amino acid residues that determine the
trypsin specificity (Gly216 and Gly226) are conserved in
trypsin PC as well. The active form of king crab trypsin
comprises 11 Cys residues. Six Cys residues have been
found in crayfish trypsin, whereas twelve Cys residues are
characteristic of trypsins from vertebrate species [29]. The
bridges Cys42–Cys58, Cys168–182, Cys191–Cys219, and
Cys136–Cys201 are most likely present in trypsin PC. The
Cys136–Cys201 disulfide bridge is a distinguishing feature of vertebrate serine proteases and is also present in
shrimp trypsin [17] and in abalone, a chymotrypsin from
a mollusk [30]. However, it is absent from the Pacifastacus
leniusculus [7] and Astacus fluviatilis trypsins [12]. There are
two additional disulfide bridges Cys22–Cys157 and
Cys127–Cys232 in vertebrates [12]. The Glu70 residue,
known as the calcium-binding site in bovine trypsin [31],
is replaced by Asp in the crab trypsin, whereas Glu80,
which also presents in calcium-binding sites of mammalian trypsins, is conserved in the crab trypsin. The calciumbinding site Glu230 of bacterial trypsin is also localized in
the crab, crayfish, and shrimp trypsins but not in trypsins
of vertebrates and insects [32]. The crab trypsin contains
Thr in position 145, unlike bovine trypsin that contains
Lys (a point of autocatalytic cleavage) in this position.
Trypsin PC is resistant to autocatalytic cleavage [2], and it
is interesting to emphasize that the crayfish trypsin con-

tains Ser in this position [12]. A low isoelectric point of
trypsin PC (3.0) reflects a low number of basic residues
(four His, four Arg, and one Lys) and a large number of
acidic residues (26) in its primary structure. Note that
bovine trypsin contains three His, two Arg, and 14 Lys
basic residues together with 10 acidic residues.
A BLAST analysis reveals a high degree of structural identity of king crab collagenolytic protease to other brachyurins I (Fig. 1). The sequence identity (Table 1) reflects a
short evolutionary distance between these enzymes. An
alignment of the entire amino acid sequences of collagenase PC and trypsin PC revealed that they are more
related to other crustacean enzymes than to those from
vertebrates and microorganisms. For example, the
sequence identity between the king crab collagenolytic
serine protease and the collagenase from U. pugilator is
76%. Approximately the same correlation is characteristic
of collagenase PC and the P. vannamei chymotrypsin
(75%). A lesser sequence identity is found between collagenase PC and other chymotrypsins from vertebrates,
insects, and microorganisms (18–29%). The sequences of
trypsin PC and other trypsins of vertebrates and invertebrates are more or less correlated (Table 2). However, the
sequence identity between the king crab collagenolytic
protease PC and trypsin PC is no greater than that with
other members of the S1 family (32%).

A comparative structural and functional analysis indicates
that these invertebrate enzymes are closely related to their
analogues from vertebrates and bacteria but differ from
them [11,19]. Thus, brachyurins demonstrate a high
degree of structural similarity (25–36 kDa, 35–40% of
amino acid sequence identity) to other members of the
chymotrypsin family of serine proteases. However, these
invertebrate enzymes have a lesser number of disulfide
bonds than their analogues from vertebrates [12,19,22]
and are particularly unstable at low pH values probably
due to this reason [5,14]. Exceptionally acidic pI values
are another special feature of them [5,13].
Phylogenetic tree
A phylogenetic tree, constructed in accordance with the
multiple alignments, demonstrates an evolutionary equal
separation of crustacean trypsins from both vertebrate and
insect trypsins; they form an isolated cluster (Fig. 3). In its
turn, crustacean collagenases are also equally separated
from vertebrate chymotrypsins and crustacean trypsins
and, together with other crustacean chymotrypsins, form
a separate cluster.

For example, the Jones–Taylor–Thornton matrix shows
that the P. camtschaticus trypsin is separated by 1.32 from
Drosophila melanogaster trypsin, by 1.16 from Bos taurus
trypsin, and by 0.41 from P. vannamei trypsin. King crab
collagenase is 1.45 away from the king crab trypsin and
1.48 away from the bovine chymotrypsin, while the distance between the prawn chymotrypsin II and the king
crab collagenase is 0.32. King crab trypsin and king crab
collagenase are separated from the S. griseus trypsin by
1.57 and 1.78, respectively. Fungal trypsins are also more
separated from the P. camtschaticus collagenase than from
the P. camtschaticus trypsin.

Conclusions
A comparative sequence analysis of brachyurins, bacterial
and vertebrate chymotrypsins, and trypsins allows us to
understand the evolution of this serine protease family
[12]. A closer inspection suggests that brachyurins share
more sequence identity with vertebrate trypsins and chymotrypsins than with their bacterial analogues, while
some important structural features, such as disulfide
bonds, are conserved between the brachyurins and bacterial enzymes. Therefore, brachyurins occupy an intermediate evolutionary position between the bacterial and
vertebrate trypsins and chymotrypsins. The major types of
brachyurins can be distinguished on the basis of sequence
similarity. The study of brachyurins significantly contributes to our understanding of the evolution of serine protease structure and function. Comparative structural and
functional analyses indicate that these invertebrate
enzymes are closely related to their vertebrate and bacterial analogues, but differ from them.

RT-PCR4
RT-PCR results for 5'-termini of trypsin and collagenase. A. Agarose gel electrophoresis of PCR products
generated using 5'-RACE primer for trypsin and step-out
primer system. B. Agarose gel electrophoresis of PCR products generated using 5'-RACE primer for collagenase and
step-out primer system. About 1 ng of the first strand cDNA
was used as a starting material for PCR reaction. Cycling was
performed in a MJ Research PTC-200 Thermocycler in calculated mode: 25 cycles for trypsin and 26 cycles for collagenase were made using cycling profile: 95°C for 8 s, 65°C
for 10 s, and 72°C for 2 min.

Methods
RNA isolation and cDNA library construction
A live king crab (P. camtschaticus) was obtained from the
local market. Total RNA was isolated from 0.5 g of hepatopancreas of king crab by guanidine–phenol–chloroform
extraction [33]. A cDNA library was obtained from 0.1 µg
of total RNA and amplified by a SMART PCR cDNA Synthesis Kit (CLONTECH) using manufacturer's protocol.
The amplified cDNA sample was 20-fold diluted with
water and used in the following RACE procedures.
Isolation of the crab collagenase cDNA and trypsin cDNA
The target fragments of the cDNAs were isolated by a
modified method for amplifying cDNA ends (RACE)
based on step-out PCR [34]. Degenerative primers were
designed to the first 10 aa residues at the N-terminus of
the mature trypsin (IVGGTEVTPG) and to 9 aa of the
mature collagenase (IVGGQEATP). They were 5'-GGC
ACC GAG GTC ACC CCN GG and 5'-GGC GGC CAG
GAG GCN ACN CC for trypsin and collagenase, respectively. The 3'-RACE PCR was carried out as follows: A 20fold diluted amplified cDNA sample (1 µl) was added to

the reaction mixture containing 1 × Advantage KlenTaq
Polymerise mix (Clontech), manufacturer's 1 × reaction
buffer, 200 µM dNTPs, 0.3 µM of degenerated primers
(for trypsin or collagenase), and step-out primer system
(0.02 µM "heel-carrier" oligo and 0.15 µM "heel-specific"
oligo [34] in a total volume of 25 µl. Cycling was performed in a MJ Research PTC-200 Thermocycler in calculated mode: 25 cycles for trypsin and 26 cycles for
collagenase were made using cycling profile: 95°C for 8 s,
65°C for 10 s, and 72°C for 2 min. PCR products were
cloned into pT-Adv vector (Clontech) and sequenced
using M13 direct and reverse universal primers by using a
Beckman SEQ-2000 automated sequencer and the FS dye
terminator chemistry. The primers for 5'-RACE were then
designed: 5'-GTC GGA GCA GGC CAG AGG A-3' for
trypsin and 5'-GGG GCC GCC AGA GTC TCC GT-3' for
collagenase. PCR was carried out as described above (see
Fig. 4). The putative signal peptides were determined
using SignalP program [35].

respectively.
Alignment of amino acid sequences and a phylogenetic
analysis of the crab collagenase and trypsin
The primary structures of enzymes used for the alignment
were taken from Swiss-Prot database. Multiple sequence
alignments were performed using ClustalW program with
manual verification [36]. To construct the phylogenetic
tree on the basis of the multiple sequence alignment, a
pairwise distance matrix was set up by the Protdist program within the PHYLIP package [37]. The construction of
the unrooted phylogenetic tree was performed by the
Bionj program [38] according to the aforementioned
matrix. The unrooted phylogenetic tree was drawn by
TreeView program [39].

List of abbreviations
