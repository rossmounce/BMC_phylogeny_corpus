Abstract
Background: Obtaining a draft genome sequence of the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), the second bird genome to
be sequenced, provides the necessary resource for whole-genome comparative analysis of gene sequence evolution
in a non-mammalian vertebrate lineage. To analyze basic molecular evolutionary processes during avian evolution, and
to contrast these with the situation in mammals, we aligned the protein-coding sequences of 8,384 1:1 orthologs of
chicken, zebra finch, a lizard and three mammalian species.
Results: We found clear differences in the substitution rate at fourfold degenerate sites, being lowest in the ancestral
bird lineage, intermediate in the chicken lineage and highest in the zebra finch lineage, possibly reflecting differences
in generation time. We identified positively selected and/or rapidly evolving genes in avian lineages and found an overrepresentation of several functional classes, including anion transporter activity, calcium ion binding, cell adhesion and
microtubule cytoskeleton.
Conclusions: Focusing specifically on genes of neurological interest and genes differentially expressed in the unique
vocal control nuclei of the songbird brain, we find a number of positively selected genes, including synaptic receptors.
We found no evidence that selection for beneficial alleles is more efficient in regions of high recombination; in fact,
there was a weak yet significant negative correlation between ω and recombination rate, which is in the direction
predicted by the Hill-Robertson effect if slightly deleterious mutations contribute to protein evolution. These findings
set the stage for studies of functional genetics of avian genes.
Background
There are nearly 10,000 known species of birds and many
of these have been instrumental in studies of general
aspects of behavior, ecology and evolution. Such basic
knowledge on life history and natural history will become
an important resource for studies aiming at elucidating
the genetic background to phenotypic evolution in natural bird populations [1]. There have already been some
attempts in this direction, including the demonstration
that the calmodulin pathway is involved in the evolution
of the spectacular differences in beak morphology among
Darwin's finches [2,3] and the critical role of MC1R governing variation in plumage color in several bird species
[4].
At the genomic level, birds have attracted the attention
of biologists for several reasons. First, compared to other
vertebrates, avian genomes are compact, with estimated

DNA content typically in the range of 1.0 to 1.5 Gb, about
half to one-third of the amount of DNA found in most
mammals [5]. It seems clear that this is mainly due to a
relatively low activity of transposable elements in birds
[6]. Second, the avian karyotype is largely conserved [7]
and is characterized by a high degree of conserved synteny. In contrast to mammals, avian chromosomes show
significant variation in size, with the karyotype of many
species containing five to ten large chromosomes ('macrochromosomes') that are comparable in size to small to
medium-sized human chromosomes, and a large number
of very small chromosomes (<20 Mb) referred to as
microchromosomes. Third, birds have female heterogamety, with the Z and W sex chromosomes present in
females while males are ZZ. Moreover, and quite surprisingly, recent evidence shows that birds do not have dosage compensation of Z chromosome genes [8,9].
The draft sequence of the chicken (Gallus gallus)
genome [10] provided a starting point for evolutionary
genomic analyses of birds. For example, it was found that
the rate of synonymous substitution (dS) correlates nega-

tively with chromosome size [11], something that may be
related to GC content and recombination rate, which are
both also negatively correlated with chromosome size.
Moreover, the heterogeneous nature of the rate of recombination across avian chromosomes seems to have a significant effect on the evolution of base composition,
reinforcing the heterogeneity in GC content (isochores)
[12], which contrasts with the situation in mammals
where isochores are generally decaying [13]. More
recently, there have been initial attempts toward identifying genes subject to positive selection in avian lineages
[14] and quantification of adaptive evolution in avian
genes and genomes [15].
Now the genome of a second avian species, the zebra
finch (Taeniopygia guttata), has been sequenced and
assembled [16]. With this additional reference point,
comparative genomic analysis of evolutionary processes
in birds can begin in earnest. In this study we analyzed
the molecular evolution of all known single-copy proteincoding genes shared by the chicken, zebra finch and
mammalian genomes. We compared rates of sequence
divergence and protein evolution in chicken and zebra
finch lineages as well as in the ancestral bird branch leading from the split between birds and lizards some 285
million years ago. We looked for signals of selection to
identify interesting genes for functional studies, similar to
previous scans for positively selected genes in the human
genome [17,18].
Additionally, we paid special attention to zebra finch
orthologs of genes that have known significance in
human learning, neurogenesis and neurodegeneration,
using information in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in
Man (OMIM) database. The zebra finch is an important
model organism for these aspects of neuroscience
[19,20]), and indeed this was a major motivation for the
decision to determine its genome sequence [21]. The
zebra finch is a songbird, one of several thousand oscines
in the order Passeriformes. Songbirds communicate via
learned vocalizations, under the control of a unique circuit of interconnected brain nuclei that evolved only in

songbirds but have parallels in the human brain [22-24].
Studies of vocal learning in songbirds have revealed roles
for lifelong neuronal turnover (neurodegeneration and
neurogeneration) in the adult brain [19,20]. Hence, it is
worthwhile to assess the evolutionary relationships of
genes potentially involved in these processes in both
humans and songbirds.

Results
Pairwise comparison of the chicken and zebra finch
protein-coding gene sets

We identified 11,225 1:1 orthologs from the pairwise
comparison of all protein-coding genes in the chicken
and zebra finch draft genome sequences. This corresponds to 60 to 65% of the total number of genes in the
avian genome [10]. The overall degree of neutral divergence, as approximated by the rate of synonymous substitution (dS) from 1,000 random sets of 150 genes [25],
between these two bird species was 0.418 (95% confidence interval = 0.387 to 0.458). The overall ω (dN/dS) in
the pairwise comparison was 0.152 (95% confidence
interval = 0.127 to 0.179).
Lineage-specific rates of evolution

For most of the subsequent analyses we used codonbased multiple species alignments of 8,384 1:1 orthologs
of chicken, zebra finch, Anolis (lizard), and three mammals, including platypus, opossum, human or mouse (see
phylogeny in Figure S1 in Additional file 1), thereby
allowing lineage-specific estimates of rates of evolution.
The rationale for focusing on single-copy genes was that
we sought to avoid problems arising from the establishment of orthology/paralogy within gene families of birds
and/or mammals. The estimates are sensitive to procedures for alignment and the substitution rate models
used; see Additional file 2 for a justification of the methods applied here. Table 1 summarizes the estimates of
mean dN, dS and ω using a free-ratio model for: (i), the
ancestral bird lineage from the split between birds and
lizards some 285 million years ago (MYA) [26] until the

split between the chicken (Galloanserae) and zebra finch
(Neoaves) lineages, for which we use an estimate of 90
MYA [27]; (ii), the chicken lineage; and (iii), the zebra
finch lineage since the split between Galloanserae and
Neoaves (Figure S1 in Additional file 1).
dS was significantly (8%) higher in the zebra finch
(0.213) than in the chicken lineage (0.197; P < 2.2 × 10-16,
Wilcoxon signed rank test; Table 1), indicating a difference in the molecular clock of these two parallel lineages.
dS of the ancestral bird lineage was higher (0.260) than in
the two terminal branches, which is not unexpected given
the estimated divergence times. The divergence at fourfold degenerate sites showed the same trend, and was
highest in the ancestral bird lineage (mean of 1 Mb intervals = 0.239), and higher in zebra finch (0.199) than in
chicken (0.172). We estimated lineage-specific mutation
rates by dividing the divergence at fourfold degenerate
sites with the estimated age of lineages according to the
divergence times given above. We found that the mutation rate was lower in the ancestral bird lineage (1.23 ×
10-9 site-1 year-1)than in both the chicken lineage (1.91 ×
10-9 site-1 year-1; P < 2 × 10-16) and the zebra finch lineage
(2.21 × 10-9 site-1 year-1; P < 2 × 10-16), and that the rate in
the chicken lineage was significantly lower than the rate
in the zebra finch lineage (P < 1 × 10-5).
The divergence at fourfold degenerate sites of orthologous genes was significantly correlated between zebra
finch and chicken on the basis of 1 Mb windows, explaining 13 to 14% of the among-windows variance (Table 2).
The correlations involving the ancestral lineage were
weak and non-significant. Since local GC content is also
conserved between zebra finch and chicken, controlling
for GC content (see Materials and methods) strongly
reduced the correlation between zebra finch and chicken
divergence (from r2 = 0.134 and 0.141 to r2 = 0.024 and

0.019 for the zebra finch and chicken, respectively; Table
2).
The zebra finch lineage had a significantly higher overall ω than the chicken lineage (0.133 versus 0.121; P < 2.2
× 10-16, Wilcoxon signed rank test). Just as for divergence,
there was a strong correlation between individual ω values of 1:1 chicken and zebra finch orthologs (r2 = 0.338, P
< 2 × 10-16). A corresponding analysis for 7,789 human
and mouse orthologs (included in the 8,384 genes from
multiple-species alignments) revealed a similarly strong
correlation (r2 = 0.359, P < 2 × 10-16). Moreover, we also
found a similar strength of correlation in gene-wise ω values estimated for orthologs from the bird lineage
(chicken and zebra finch) with the mammalian lineage
(human and mouse lineages; r2 = 0.325, P < 2 × 10-16). The
gene-wise correlations between ω values for the ancestral
bird lineage (which had an overall ω of 0.110) and chicken
(r2 = 0.178, P < 2 × 10-16) and zebra finch (r2 = 0.170, P < 2
× 10-16), respectively, were weaker.
Adaptive evolution of genes in the avian genome

We next sought to identify genes, and the functional categories these genes are associated with, that are candidates
for being involved with lineage-specific adaptations during avian evolution. We considered the ancestral bird lineage as well as the terminal chicken and zebra finch
lineages separately, and posed three specific questions.
First, which genes have evolved most rapidly in avian
lineages (high ω values), indicative of either adaptive evolution or relaxed selective constraint? For this question
we used a likelihood ratio test to determine which genes
had a significantly higher ω value than the mean of all
genes in the genome. These genes are referred to as rapidly evolving bird (REB) genes. We used this approach
rather than simply selecting, for example, the top 5% or

10% of genes sorted by ω value since the confidence in ω
values is dependent of alignment length and the number
of substitutions within a particular gene.
Second, which genes have evolved more rapidly in
avian lineages than in other amniote lineages (mammals
and lizard)? Here we used a branch model in PAML to
determine which genes had a significantly higher ω in
avian lineages than in other branches of the tree corresponding to our data. These genes are referred to as more
rapidly evolving in birds (MREB).
Third, which genes show evidence of containing codons
that have been subject to positive selection (referred to as
PS genes) during avian evolution? For this third question
we used a branch-site model in PAML to identify genes
containing positively selected codons with ω higher than
1.
In total, 1,751 genes were identified as evolving significantly more rapidly than the genomic average (REB) in
one or more of the three avian lineages (Table 3). Of these
REB genes, 203 (12%) were common to all three lineages
(Figure S2 in Additional file 1); 1,649 genes showed evidence of more rapid evolution in one or more bird lineages (MREB) than in other amniotes (Table 3). The great
majority (>97%) of these genes were specific to a single
bird lineage, with no gene common to all three lineages
(Figure S2 in Additional file 1). We also identified 1,886
PS genes in avian lineages (Table 3). Most (>85%) of these
genes showed evidence of positive selection in only a single lineage (Figure S2 in Additional file 1). As for the REB
category, it may contain genes that evolve rapidly due to
positive selection but also due to relaxed constraint.
Using randomization tests, we compared the number of
overlapping genes between the REB and PS gene lists
with the number of overlapping genes from gene lists
generated randomly. For all three avian branches (zebra
finch, chicken, and ancestral bird lineages), the number of
overlapping genes between the PS and REB gene lists is
significantly higher than in randomized data sets (P <
0.001 for all three branches). This shows that the genes
that we identified as rapidly evolving are unlikely to be
dominated by genes evolving under relaxed constraint.
The lists of REB, MREB and PS genes will constitute a
useful resource for future research aimed at finding the
genetic basis of adaptive evolution in birds, in particular
the list of PS genes. Here we provide an initial characterization of genes from these lists by first testing for an

Page 4 of 17

over-representation of specific gene ontologies (Table 4).
The term 'cell adhesion' was over-represented among
REB, MREB as well as PS genes in the ancestral bird lineage. Terms related to ion-channel activity were over-represented among PS genes in both the ancestral bird and
chicken lineages. The ancestral lineage also showed an
over-representation of the terms blood vessel development, synapse organization, integrin-mediated signaling
pathway and proteinaceous extracellular matrix among
MREB genes and of cytokine secretion among REB genes.
In the chicken lineage, telomere organization and sterol
transport were enriched among REB genes while in the
zebra finch lineage microtubule cytoskeleton was overrepresented among MREB genes. Table S1 in Additional
file 1 lists all genes corresponding to significantly overrepresented Gene Ontology (GO) terms.
If positively selected codons are evenly distributed
across genes and the power to detect such codons is more
or less constant, then the likelihood of detecting genes
containing positively selected codons will correlate with
alignment length. Consistent with this, three out of three
unique overrepresented GO terms from the list of positively selected genes in the ancestral bird branch have
longer mean alignment length than genes with other GO
terms (P < 0.001, Wilcoxon rank sum test). However, the
overrepresented GO terms from the list of positively
selected genes in the chicken lineage have actually shorter
mean alignment length than genes with other GO terms,
with marginal significance (P = 0.093). This warrants further investigation, from both methodological and biological points of view.
As a comparison, we tested for over-represented GO
terms among positively selected mammalian genes and
genes evolving significantly faster in mammals than in
birds (Table S2 in Additional file 1). However, using the
same criteria as applied to the lists of avian genes, no GO
term was significantly over-represented in the mammalian lists.
Adaptive evolution of neurological genes

The lineage leading to the zebra finch and other passerine
birds is distinguished from the chicken lineage by major
neurobehavioral adaptations that have parallels in
humans, including the evolution of vocal communication
as well as other forms of learning, memory and social
cognition [28]. We filtered the lists of positively selected

genes in the zebra finch and chicken lineages to identify
candidate genes likely to contribute to evolution of these
traits. We began by considering the orthologs of genes
that have been most strongly implicated in learning and
neuronal plasticity in humans, identifying them by
searching the OMIM database for all genes associated
with 'learning', 'neurogeneration' or 'neurodegeneration'.
We had data from multispecies alignments for 74, 211
and 107 such genes, respectively (Table 5). We found that
15, 34 and 23 of these genes (in total, 58 unique genes)
were present in the list of 1,036 genes identified as positively selected in the zebra finch lineage (Table 5; Table S3
in Additional file 1). For the term 'neurodegeneration' in
particular, the number of positively selected genes is significantly higher than expected by chance (P = 0.0076,
Fisher's exact test) given the overall frequency of positively selected genes among all genes in our study.
We then compared the number of genes classified as
associated with 'learning', 'neurogeneration' or 'neurodegeneration' that were found to be positively selected in
either the chicken or zebra finch lineage (that is, excluding genes that were positively selected in both lineages).
Interestingly, for each OMIM term the number of unique
positively selected genes was significantly higher in zebra
finch than in chicken (Table 5; 10 versus 5, 27 versus 15,
and 16 versus 8, respectively). This indicates that the
songbird lineage has experienced more frequent adaptive
evolution of genes relating to cognitive functions than the
galliform lineage.
The 58 neurological genes evolving under positive
selection in the songbird lineage were further assessed in
two ways. First, we asked whether any of them also show
evidence of accelerated sequence evolution in the primate
lineage, using data from the study of Dorus et al. [29].
Four genes are present on both lists: ASPM, GRIN2a,
DRD2, and LHX2 (Table 6). Second, we asked whether
any of them are also expressed differentially within the
songbird-specific song control nuclei of the zebra finch
brain. Lovell et al. [30] used a combination of microarray
and in situ hybridization analyses to identify approxi-

mately 300 genes that are differentially expressed in the
song nucleus high vocal centre (HVC) compared to the
underlying brain tissue. We found that 9 of our 58 neurological genes evolving under positive selection are also
differentially regulated in the high vocal centre (Table 6),
including glutamate receptor ion channel genes.
The relationship between selection and recombination

We sought to elucidate how the intensity of selection
and/or the influence of genetic drift, manifested in ω,
vary across the avian genome. The potential influence of
recombination on ω was of particular interest since the
rate of recombination is unusually heterogeneous within
both the chicken [31] and zebra finch [32] genomes, and
probably so for birds in general. Such heterogeneity could
set the stage for recombination affecting the efficacy of
selection and thereby ω, as predicted by evolutionary theory [33] but for which there is limited empirical support
[34-38].
As a starting point for these analyses we first noted that
there was a weak positive correlation between ω estimated for 1 Mb intervals and chromosome size in zebra
finch (Figure 1; r2 = 0.055, P = 6 × 10-11) and chicken (r2 =
0.029, P = 3 × 10-6). This confirms similar observations
made for a small set of chicken-turkey orthologs [11] as
well as for chicken-human orthologs [10], although the
effect we detected here with much larger data sets was
considerably weaker than indicated by those previous
studies. There was a strong negative correlation between
the mean divergence of fourfold degenerate sites of 1 Mb
intervals and chromosome size (Figure 2; r2 = 0.153 in
zebra finch and r2 = 0.140 in chicken, P < 2 × 10-16 in both
cases). These correlations were not limited to the dichotomy of macrochromosomes versus microchromosomes
(data not shown); indeed, for many birds chromosome
size shows a relatively continuous distribution without a
clear distinction between macrochromosomes and
microchromosomes [7].
We found a weak yet statistically significant negative
relationship between recombination rate and ω in both

Evolving rapidly in the primate lineage [29]

Differentially expressed in zebra finch song control system [30]

Neurological genes under positive selection in the zebra finch (see also Table S3 in Additional file 1) were assessed for representation in the
results of two other studies: orthologs under positive selection in the primate lineage (Dorus et al. [29]) and zebra finch genes that are
differentially expressed in song nucleus the high vocal centre compared to the underlying 'shelf' region (Lovell et al. [30]).

zebra finch (Table 7; r2 = 0.030, P = 4 × 10-5) and chicken
(r2 = 0.011, P = 0.005). This could possibly be related to
other factors co-varying with these parameters. For
example, GC is strongly correlated with recombination
rate in both chicken [31] and zebra finch [32], and in our
data GC content correlates negatively and weakly with ω
(zebra finch, r2 = 0.017, P = 0.002; chicken, r2 = 0.005, P =
0.068). GC content might be correlated with ω because
biased gene conversion tends to increase ω due to an
increased rate of fixation of slightly deleterious alleles,
mimicking adaptive evolution [39], and higher GC content tends to decrease the number of synonymous sites
[40,41]. Moreover, gene density is higher in avian microchromosomes than in macrochromosomes [10] and there
are strong correlations between chromosome size and
both GC and recombination rate [31]. Gene density
might be critical to the effects of recombination on the
efficacy of selection because more coding sequence
should, in principle, imply more targets for selection.
When we tested for a correlation between recombination
rate and ω at the same time as controlling for GC and
gene density (proportion of coding sequence within 1 Mb
windows), we still found weak yet significant negative
relationships (chicken, r2 = 0.006, P = 0.032; zebra finch,

r2 = 0.008, P = 0.031). The effect is not limited to regions
with very low recombination rate as similar results were
obtained when comparing windows with zero and nonzero recombination rates (data not shown).

Discussion
Modern birds form two monophyletic clades, the
Palaeognathae (ratites, like ostrich and its allies) and the
Neognathae (the great majority of contemporary bird
species), which diverged during the cretaceous between
80 and 130 MYA [42-45]. Within the Neognathae, the
first split was between Galloanserae (fowl-like birds
(including chicken), ducks and geese) and Neoaves (>20
different orders) [46,47]. Diversification within Neoaves
seems to have occurred rapidly, with very short internal
nodes in the basal part of the Neoaves tree [45,48]. One of
these early offshoots within Neoaves was the order Passeriformes, to which zebra finch belongs. These birds
typically have small body size and are relatively shortlived compared to chicken and their allies within Galloanserae.
When judged from the divergence at fourfold degenerate sites across more than 8,000 genes, the mean mutation rate in birds was 1.23 to 2.21 × 10-9 site-1 year-1. The

rate was lowest in the ancestral bird lineage from the split
between birds and lizards until the split between Galloanserae and Neoaves (1.23 × 10-9 site-1 year-1), was
intermediate in the chicken lineage (1.91 × 10-9 site-1 year1) and was highest in the zebra finch lineage (2.21 × 10-9
site-1 year-1). This indicates a rate acceleration among
modern birds and particularly so in Neoaves, or more
specifically, in the lineage leading to zebra finch. The difference in mutation rate between the chicken and zebra
finch lineages is in a direction predicted by a generation
time effect [49]: shorter generation times among small
songbirds may have led to higher per-year mutation rates.
We note that this inference relies on the underlying
assumption of neutrality of fourfold degenerate sites. To
the best of our knowledge there is no evidence for codon
usage bias in avian genes; if it exists, it seems unlikely that
selection for codon usage on a genome-wide scale would
differ among the investigated lineages to an extent that
can explain the almost twofold higher mutation rate in
the zebra finch compared to the ancestral lineage.
The lower mutation rate estimated for the ancestral
bird branch is sensitive to the accuracy of the estimated
divergence times of birds and lizards (285 MYA), and of
Galloanserae and Neoaves (90 MYA). Previous molecular
datings of the Galloanserae-Neoaves split have provided
estimates in the range of 90 to 126 MYA, with a mean of

105 MYA [50]. Using this mean value, instead of 90 MYA,
to estimate the substitution rate still leads to a faster rate
in modern birds than in the ancestral bird branch (zebra
finch, 1.90 × 10-9 site-1 year-1; chicken, 1.63 × 10-9 site-1
year-1; ancestral birds, 1.33 × 10-9 site-1 year-1). The earliest divergence estimate of 126 MYA leads to similar substitution rates in the ancestral and zebra finch lineages.
However, such an old divergence is not supported by the
fossil record, which indicates a split younger than 100
MYA [42,44]. Importantly, not a single modern bird is
known in the lower cretaceous (145 to 100 MY) despite a
reasonably good fossil record [43,51,52]. Another potential concern is that, because of saturation (that is, when
multiple substitutions impair the model to reliably estimate substitution rates), the ancestral branch length may
have been underestimated. It is difficult to directly assess
the possible effect of saturation on the length of the
ancestral bird branch. However, we note that a similar
trend (lower rate of divergence in the ancestral branch) is
not evident among eutherian mammals from the same set
of genes (Table S4 in Additional file 1).
The ancestral lineage from the split between birds and
lizards until the split between Galloanserae and Neoaves
represents, for the most part, dinosaurs that existed
before the appearance of modern birds (Archaeopteryx
fossils date back around 145 MYA). If the estimated

mutation rates are correct and if one assumes a generation time effect, our data would suggest that generation
times in the saurischian dinosaur lineage were typically
longer than in modern birds.

Previous studies of divergence in mammalian genomes
have indicated a low degree of substitution rate conservation over evolutionary time scales comparable to that
between chicken and zebra finch, for example, in the

comparison between primate and rodent lineages [53,54].
These estimate have been based on interspersed repeat
elements under the (reasonable) assumption that these
sequences are selectively neutral. Our analysis of divergence at fourfold degenerate sites between orthologous
regions of chicken and zebra finch revealed a stronger
correlation, with 13 to 14% of the variation in divergence
in one lineage explained by variation in divergence in the
other. This could reflect that the selective constraints on
fourfold degenerate sites and interspersed elements differ
(being higher in fourfold degenerate sites) so that the two
approaches are not directly comparable. Alternatively,
there might be biological explanations for high mutation
rate conservation in birds. When controlling for the local
GC content, the amount of variation in divergence
explained by the orthologous rate is reduced to 2%. This
shows that avian mutation rate conservation is largely
dependent of conservation in base composition. Compared to mammalian genomes, avian GC content is
highly heterogeneous and this heterogeneity has been
maintained during avian evolution [12]. It was suggested
that the heterogeneous recombinational landscape of
birds [12] reinforces GC heterogeneity via biased gene
conversion. Local recombination rates are significantly
correlated between chicken and zebra finch [32] and it
may very well be that there is a causal connection
between conservation in recombination, base composition and mutation rate [55-57].
Over-represented gene ontologies among positively
selected or rapidly evolving genes

With draft sequences now available for two avian
genomes it is possible to study the role of natural selection in shaping individual gene sequences during avian
evolution. An impetus for our study was thus to identify
genes and gene categories that have been important for
adaptive character evolution in a vertebrate lineage.
Clearly, there are many morphological, physiological and
behavioral phenotypes that distinguish birds and mammals. A comparative genomic approach has the potential
to contribute towards the identification of the genetic
basis of these differences [58].
Basic characteristics of birds such as feathers, flight and
hollow bones evolved prior to the split of the chicken and
zebra finch lineages. The genetic novelties underlying
these phenotypes should thus have started to appear in an
ancestral lineage. As discussed above, the ancestral bird
branch in the phylogenetic tree formed by our data corresponds mostly to non-avian dinosaurs of the order Saurischia, suborder Theropoda. Genes or gene categories
identified as positively selected or rapidly evolving in this
branch may thus be related to phenotypic evolution in
non-avian dinosaurs rather than in modern birds. On the

Page 10 of 17

other hand, many bird-like features may have started to
emerge already for non-avian dinosaurs.
The two GO terms found to be over-represented
among genes evolving under positive selection in the
ancestral bird lineage, calcium ion binding and cell adhesion, largely represent an overlapping set of genes. Most
of these genes (Table S1 in Additional file 1) encode
transmembrane cadherins that play a critical role in cellcell adhesion in tissue structures. One of these cadherins,
protocadherin-15, is expressed in retina and we note that
another positively selected calcium ion binding gene,
Crumbs homolog 1, is involved with photoreceptor morphogenesis in retina; mutations in the human ortholog
cause retinitis pigmentosa type 12 [59]. The visual ability
of birds is superior to other vertebrates and the molecular
adaptations underlying this phenotype are likely to have
been driven by positive selection.
In the chicken lineage the term anion transmembrane
transporter activity was over-represented among positively selected genes. The genes annotated with this term
include solute carriers and ion channels involved with
basic cell signaling processes, for example, in neurotransmission. In the zebra finch lineage the term microtubule
cytoskeleton was over-represented among genes evolving
faster in this lineage than in other branches of the
amniote tree. The majority of these are kinesins and other
genes involved with mitosis/meiosis, sperm motility, centrosome formation and synapse function.
It should be stressed that we inferred positive selection
in lineages corresponding to nearly 100 million years or
more of evolution and that large numbers of genes were
uncovered by these analyses. This is likely to reduce the
power of detecting enriched GO terms due to dilution
and failure to capture temporal episodes of adaptive evolution. Moreover, given that our data were defined by a
common set of 1:1 orthologous genes found in birds, a
lizard and mammals, the analysis did not include lineagespecific genes that may be particularly responsive to positive selection. These aspects are probably of relevance to
the somewhat surprising observation that no significantly
over-represented GO terms were found among positively
selected or rapidly evolving mammalian genes. This is
seemingly at odds with previous work in primates that
frequently have revealed categories such as sensory perception, immune defence, apoptosis and spermatogenesis
to be enriched among positively selected genes [17,18,6062]. In birds, there have recently been large-scale efforts
toward transcriptome sequencing of several species,
including songbirds [63]. These data will allow study of
the molecular evolution of genes in much shorter
branches of the avian phylogenetic tree than is currently
possible with complete genome sequences, which is only
available for chicken and zebra finch.

Zebra finch and positive selection in neurological genes

The zebra finch communicates through learned vocalizations ('songs'). Only the male zebra finch produces
learned song, and he learns this song by copying an adult
tutor during a critical period in juvenile development.
Experimental work in zebra finch has demonstrated the
localization and character of neural circuits involved in
developmental song learning and adult singing [64-67],
with dynamic regulation of brain gene expression in
response to singing and song experience [68-76]. Fiftyeight genes with known roles in learning, neurogenesis or
neurodegeneration in humans show evidence of positive
selection in the zebra finch lineage. Of these, nine (15%;
Table 6) are also expressed differentially in the song control system, either at higher or lower levels than in the
surrounding brain tissue, according to the study of Lovell
et al. [30]. In comparison, only 2% (390 out of 17,214)
unique brain-derived cDNA probes on that microarray
gave differential hybridization signals in the song control
system. We note that five of the nine genes encode proteins involved in cell surface and synaptic signaling: voltage-dependent L-type calcium channel subunit alpha-1D
(CACNA1D), G protein-coupled receptor 98 precursor
(GPR98), glutamate receptor, ionotropic AMPA 2
(GRIA2), glutamate receptor, metabotropic 1 (GRM1),
and protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type F
(PTPRF). GRIA12 is also one of the ion channel genes
that are suppressed in response to song playbacks as
reported in Warren et al. [16].
Four of the 58 genes show evidence of accelerated evolution in the primate lineage: ASPM, GRIN2a, DRD2, and
LHX2. Two of these have apparent roles in neurogenesis
and neuronal development (ASPM and LHX2). In particular, ASPM (abnormal spindle-like microcephaly-associated) has been a focus of speculation with respect to the
dramatic evolution of brain size in humans. Homozygous
mutations in ASPM are a cause of primary microcephaly
[77] and the gene shows evidence of positive selection in
both the human lineage [78-80] and the ancestral lineage
of the apes [81]. Songbirds have also experienced a relative increase in brain size compared to other avian lineages [82], with the notable emergence of the large and
highly plastic nuclei of the song control system. However,
enthusiasm for ASPM as a key factor in primate brain
evolution has been tempered by findings that mutations
in ASPM are not correlated with cognitive ability [83,84]
and by alternative roles for ASPM that might place it
under selection more broadly, such as a role in ciliary
function [85].
The other two neurological genes that are also accelerated in primates may be considered to have neuromodulatory functions that can directly affect learning, memory
and behavior. DRD2 encodes the D2 subtype of the dopamine receptor. GRIN2a encodes a subunit of the N-

Page 11 of 17

methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, a subtype of ionotropic glutamate-gated ion channel that has well-established roles in learning and brain plasticity (reviewed in
[86]). A survey of GRIN2a sequences across primate species revealed a specific correlation between ω and home
range size, which is taken to be a proxy for spatial memory [87]. Spatial memory is well developed in the songbird (passerine) lineage and is especially evident in foodcaching species [88], a behavior that depends on NMDA
receptor function [89]. Zebra finches are not studied as a
food caching species, but their nomadic lifestyle implies a
highly sophisticated spatial sense [90]. NMDA receptors
have also been implicated in song learning and song control system neurophysiology [91,92]. The rich diversity of
songbird species and their adaptations should provide
unusual opportunities for correlating NMDA receptor
sequence evolution with specific behavioral and neurophysiological variations.
The strength of selection during avian evolution

The overall strength of selection as manifested in the
genome-wide ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous
substitution rates (ω) was similar in the chicken and zebra
finch lineages (0.12 to 0.13), as well as in the ancestral
bird lineage (0.11). These ratios are about half that
reported among hominids and more similar to what is
seen in the murid and dog lineages [62]. This may be
taken to suggest that the rate of adaptive evolution and/or
the rate of accumulation of slightly deleterious mutations
have been lower in birds than in primates. However, it is
increasingly appreciated that point estimates of mean ω
can be misleading. Mean ω decreases with branch length
and needs to be seen in a time trajectory framework
rather than as a fixed quantity [93-95]. The apparent lineage-specific differences between hominids on the one
side and murids, dogs and birds on the other may thus
simply be accounted for by branch length. Future
research will be needed to explore how branch length is
best accounted for when comparing mean ω for different
lineages. This will be important when addressing whether
life history variables, such as the effective population size
(Ne), correlate with mean ω. For example, such a correlation might be expected if slightly deleterious mutations
contribute significantly to protein evolution as postulated
by a nearly neutral model [96], giving rise to a negative
relationship between mean ω and Ne [97].
The relationship between natural selection and
recombination in avian genomes

Selection acts in each generation on alleles embedded
within a particular genomic background. Due to recombination, selection will, over time, be able to favor or disfavor alleles at individual loci without affecting the rest of
the genome. This comes with a caveat that when two loci

Nam et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R68
http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/6/R68

are genetically linked, selection at one locus will affect the
efficiency of selection at the other: the loci are said to
interfere with each other. Theory predicts that the
strength of interference should be related to the amount
of recombination between the loci; this is the so-called
Hill-Robertson effect [33]. Theoretical predictions on the
consequence of Hill-Robertson interference on coding
sequence evolution depend on the fitness distribution of
segregating variants at non-synonymous sites [98,99]. If
slightly deleterious mutations segregate frequently in the
population, directional selection at one locus will
increase the probability of fixation of such mutations at
linked loci. If beneficial alleles are common in the population, the probability of fixation of those mutations will be
reduced at linked loci. These two scenarios are associated
with opposing predictions for the correlation between
recombination rate and ω; in the former case a negative
relationship is expected whereas in the latter case a positive relationship is expected.
The strongest support for Hill-Robertson interference
comes from regions devoid of recombination. For example, ω is generally high in the non-recombining sex chromosome, that is, the Y chromosome in systems with male
heterogamety and the W chromosome in systems with
female heterogamety [100-102]. However, it has been surprisingly difficult to find genome-wide empirical support
for Hill-Robertson interference, and data are currently
limited to studies in Drosophila [34,35,103,104] and a
recent study of humans failed to demonstrate a correlation between recombination rate and ω [37].
It is possible that the power for detecting a relationship
between recombination and ω could be higher in bird
systems because the rate of recombination is highly heterogeneous, at least within the two avian genomes for
which detailed information is currently available on
regional recombination rate variation. Specifically, there
is a clear negative relationship between chromosome size
and recombination rate [10,31] following from an obligate recombination event per chromosomal arm. In
chicken, the average per-chromosome recombination
rate ranges from 2 centiMorgans (cM)/Mb up to 10 cM/
Mb [10]. Moreover, there is significant within-chromosome variation in the rate of recombination with a strong
'telomere effect'. This is most readily seen in zebra finch,
with rates close to 10 cM/Mb in terminal regions of the
larger (>100 Mb) chromosomes while the central parts
have rates as low as 0.1 cM/Mb; the latter is not just a
'centromere effect' because these recombination deserts
cover up to 75% of the larger chromosomes [32].
We do not find support for an increased efficiency of
directional selection in regions of high recombination. If
anything, the data go in the opposite direction since there
was a weak negative, yet significant relationship between
ω and recombination rate in both chicken and zebra finch

Page 12 of 17

(r2 < 0.01, after controlling for GC content and the
amount of coding sequence); this is the direction predicted from the hypothesis of an accumulation of slightly
deleterious mutations in regions with low recombination
rate. One obvious explanation for this weak relationship
is that both slightly deleterious and beneficial variants are
common and that their opposing effects in Hill-Robertson interference largely cancel each other out. However,
in the absence of simulations under different distributions of the fitness consequences of segregation mutations this remains an argument that is difficult to
examine.
Another explanation relates to the fact that recombination rate and ω are measured on very different time
scales. Recombination is recorded from pedigree data
and thus reflects the rate in contemporary populations.
Lineage-specific ω represents substitutions that have
accumulated during, in this case, 90 million years of avian
evolution. If the recombination landscape has changed
frequently during the course of this time period, this may
have weakened the signal of potential recombination
effects on the pattern of efficacy of selection across the
genome. There is limited knowledge on the evolutionary
consistency of regional recombination rate variation
[105]. At a local scale, recombination hot-spots are
ephemeral in the human genome with little or no evidence for hot-spots at orthologous positions in the chimpanzee genome [106-108]. As indicated above,
recombination rates in birds are strongly associated with
chromosome features, with highly elevated rates in
microchromosomes and in telomeric regions of larger
chromosomes. Given the high degree of karyotype stability in birds [7], this may suggest that the recombination
landscape has also remained relatively stable. Indeed, we
have found that recombination rates in 1-Mb windows of
the chicken and zebra finch genomes to be significantly
correlated [32]. Moreover, the strong correlation
observed between base composition (GC content) and
current recombination rates in both chicken [31] and
zebra finch [32] is consistent with a conserved pattern of
recombination rate variation, at least under the scenario
that recombination drives the long-term evolution of
base composition (maintenance of regions elevated in GC
content) by biased gene conversion [57]. An alternative
possibility is that base composition drives recombination
rate variation and it is conservation of GC content, or
GC-rich motifs [109], that results in the appearance of
recombination rate conservation.
Further, the influence of Hill-Robertson interference on
the accumulation of mildly deleterious substitutions is
not expected to decrease linearly with an increase of the
recombination rate [37,110]. In this context, it is possible
that the recombination rate is too high in most regions of
the chicken and the zebra finch genome to lead to mea-

Nam et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R68
http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/6/R68

surable variation in the efficiency of selection. This would
somewhat contradict the observation of very low recombination rates in the sub-centromeric region of the larger
zebra finch chromosomes [32]. However, these recombination deserts can have a high effective number of
recombination events given a very large population size,
as is observed for natural zebra finch populations [111].
In general, it may very well be that the effective population sizes of ancestral passerines have been higher than
that of other (larger) birds.

Conclusions
We conducted a comparative analysis between two avian
genomes using one lizard and three mammalian species
as outgroups. Substitution rates were estimated from
8,384 1:1 orthologs of genes at fourfold degenerated sites
and calibrated with the fossil record. We found clear substitution rate differences between the ancestral bird lineage and the lineage leading to chicken and to zebra
finch, and argue that the differences possibly reflect an
effect of generation time. We further report a list of positively selected and/or rapidly evolving genes in the abovementioned avian lineages. GO terms for several
biological processes were over-represented among the
positively selected genes, including anion transporter
activity, calcium ion binding, cell adhesion and microtubule cytoskeleton. We highlight a set of 58 genes evolving
under positive selection in the songbird lineage that are
of particular interest in neurobiology. Nine of these genes
are also differentially expressed in the unique vocal control nuclei of the songbird brain and may warrant special
attention in the future. Finally, a significant but low negative relationship between recombination rate and ω supports the theoretical prediction that the efficiency of
purifying selection may be reduced in regions of low
recombination rate.
Materials and methods
Alignments

We downloaded protein-coding sequences from the
chicken (G. gallus, WASHUC2), zebra finch (T. guttata,
TaeGut3.2.4), green lizard (Anolis carolinensis,
ANOCAR1), short-tailed opossum (Monodelphis domestica, MonDom5), platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus,
OANA5), mouse (Mus musculus, NCBIM37) and human
(Homo sapiens, NCBI36) genome assemblies through
biomart [112] in Ensembl version 55. In order to identify
1:1 orthologs between zebra finch and each of the other
species, we used a reciprocal Blast best hit approach as
implemented in Inparanoid3.0 [113]. Codon-based pairwise alignments from the corresponding protein
sequences were made using MUSCLE3.7 [114]. We used
Gblocks 0.91b [115] to eliminate poorly aligned positions.
In total, our analysis was based on 8,384 genes.

Estimates of substitution rates
Pairwise rates

We used the codeml program in the PAML4.1 package
[116] to estimate mean pairwise dS and ω (dN/dS) for all
11,225 1:1 orthologs of chicken and zebra finch from
1,000 concatenated alignments each constructed from
150 randomly chosen genes. Concatenation of alignments reduces the sampling variance by producing longer
sequences for which parameters can be estimated more
precisely [25]. The repeated sampling allows estimation
of the within-genome variance (95% confidence intervals).
Fourfold degenerate rate

The neutral lineage-specific substitution rate in 1-Mb
windows of the chicken and zebra finch genomes was
approximated by estimating the divergence of fourfold
degenerate sites (third codon positions of fourfold degenerated codons) using a GTR+ Gamma4 model of substitution with the baseml program in the PAML4.1 package.
We based our analysis on windows with at least 1 kb of
degenerate sites.
Lineage-specific substitution rates

We estimated lineage-specific mean dN, dS, and ω using
the free-ratio model [117] in the same way as for the pairwise comparison, that is, applying the Heger and Ponting
[25] method. Lineage-specific ω of individual genes was
estimated using the branch model of PAML4.1, making
the branch of interest foreground and collecting ω from
this branch. This method has the advantage that it tends
to show less sampling variance than a free-ratio model.
Mean ω values for 1-Mb windows were estimated by
concatenating all alignments within each window and
using the three-ratio model in codeml. This model was
chosen to reduce the number of parameters and thus to
avoid the problem of over-parameterization when small
numbers of substitutions are analyzed. Windows were
excluded if the alignment length was less than 1 kb or if
the number of substitutions per window was fewer than
200. This approach avoids problems with decreased precision of estimates (higher sampling variances) when the
number of substitutions is low.
The ω values for individual alignments were calculated
using the three-ratio model in codeml. Alignments were
excluded if dS > 2 or ω > 3 [14]. This analysis was based on
7,415 genes in birds and on 6,252 in eutherian mammals.
Statistical models

We used bivariate and partial correlations to analyze the
relationship between ω and recombination rate separately
in chicken and zebra finch. The sex-average recombination rate for 1-Mb windows was obtained for chicken
from Groenen et al. [31] and for zebra finch from Backström et al. [32]. Partial correlations controlled for GC
content and the amount of coding sequence within each

Nam et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R68

window individually and in combination. Similarly, we
used bivariate and partial correlation (controlling for GC
content) to study the association between divergence at
fourfold degenerate sites from 1-Mb windows in different
bird species. Since the windows were not identical
between zebra finch and chicken, we estimated the correlations separately for zebra finch-chicken, and for
chicken-zebra finch. The similarity in the results shows
that the analysis is not susceptible to the exact location of
windows. When controlling for GC content in correlations between zebra finch/chicken and the ancestral bird
linage, we used the average GC content of both chicken
and zebra finch as an estimate of GC content in the
ancestral lineage.
Identification of candidate genes for adaptive evolution
Rapidly evolving bird (REB) genes

We used a likelihood ratio test to identify genes evolving
significantly faster than the average of all genes in a particular lineage. To do so, we compared the likelihood of a
model where ω was estimated for a particular gene under
consideration, to a null model where ω was fixed to the
genome-wide estimate of ω (degrees of freedom (d.f.) =
1), followed by multiple testing correction by false discovery rate (q < 0.05) using the program Qvalue [117]. This
gives a list of genes that show significantly different ω values, both higher and lower, than the genomic average, of
which we considered the genes with higher ω values to
represent faster evolving genes.
Genes more rapidly evolving in birds (MREB) than in other
amniotes

We used the branch model in codeml to identify genes
that have evolved significantly faster in a particular lineage compared to the rest of the tree. The null hypothesis
assumed that all branches of the tree have the same ω
while the alternative hypothesis allows the tested branch
to have a different ω. We used a likelihood ratio test with
d.f. = 1 to compare the two hypotheses, followed by multiple testing correction by false discovery rate (q < 0.05)
using Qvalue [117]. This gives a list of genes where ω in
the lineage of interest (zebra finch, chicken or ancestral
bird lineage) is significantly different, either higher or
lower, from ω in the other lineages. We only report the
genes that have significantly higher ω values.

of positively selected genes, alignments with fewer than
45 codons were excluded. This analysis was based on
8,260 genes in birds and 7,690 genes in eutherian mammals.
Gene Ontology analysis

To test for overrepresentation of biological processes,
molecular functions and cellular components among
positively selected or rapidly evolving genes, we performed GO analysis using GoStat [121]. We downloaded
GO annotations for chicken, human and mouse from
Biomart. The analysis was based on Fisher's exact test
between two lists of genes, that is, PS genes and a reference list of all analyzed genes. Multiple testing corrected
significance values were based on Benjamini and Hochberg [122] correction (adjusted P < 0.1), included with the
GoStat software.
Analysis of neurological genes

The OMIM database [123] was searched on 29 March
2009, using three different search phrases and a search
limit set for 'prefix star' (that is, to find only OMIM terms
associated with a known gene sequence). One search was
on the term 'learning'. To search for genes related to neurogenesis, we used this phrase: [(stem cell AND neur*)
OR neurogen*]. To search for genes related to neurodegeneration, we used 'neurogen*'. Human gene IDs in
OMIM were cross-referenced and corrected or completed as needed against the HGNC database, and used to
retrieve Ensembl gene IDs for human and zebra finch
orthologs (Ensembl 53) via Biomart.

Genes evolving under positive selection

To detect genes containing codons (at least one) evolving
under positive selection in a specific branch (the foreground branch) we used a branch-site test for positive
selection [118,119] implemented in the codeml program
of the PAML4.1 package. We used the likelihood ratio
test 2, with d.f. = 1, with the null hypothesis that ω2 was
fixed to 1 compared to an alternative model where ω > 1
[120], followed by multiple testing correction by false discovery rate (q < 0.05) using Qvalue [117]. For the analysis
