Abstract
Background: The mitochondrial (mt) genomes of sponges possess a variety of features, which
appear to be intermediate between those of Eumetazoa and non-metazoan opisthokonts. Among
these features is the presence of long intergenic regions, which are common in other eukaryotes,
but generally absent in Eumetazoa. Here we analyse poriferan mitochondrial intergenic regions,
paying particular attention to repetitive sequences within them. In this context we introduce the
mitochondrial genome of Ircinia strobilina (Lamarck, 1816; Demospongiae: Dictyoceratida) and
compare it with mtDNA of other sponges.
Results: Mt genomes of dictyoceratid sponges are identical in gene order and content but display
major differences in size and organization of intergenic regions. An even higher degree of diversity
in the structure of intergenic regions was found among different orders of demosponges. One
interesting observation made from such comparisons was of what appears to be recurrent
invasions of sponge mitochondrial genomes by repetitive hairpin-forming elements, which cause
large genome size differences even among closely related taxa. These repetitive hairpin-forming
elements are structurally and compositionally divergent and display a scattered distribution
throughout various groups of demosponges.
Conclusion: Large intergenic regions of poriferan mt genomes are targets for insertions of
repetitive hairpin- forming elements, similar to the ones found in non-metazoan opisthokonts. Such
elements were likely present in some lineages early in animal mitochondrial genome evolution but
were subsequently lost during the reduction of intergenic regions, which occurred in the
Eumetazoa lineage after the split of Porifera. Porifera acquired their elements in several
independent events. Patterns of their intra-genomic dispersal can be seen in the mt genome of
Vaceletia sp.

Background
Organellar genomes display a tendency of size reduction
(deletional bias) [1]. This tendency manifests itself in the

loss of mitochondrial (mt) protein genes or their relocation to the nucleus, and in the loss of intergenic non-coding sequences. For example, comparison between animal

mt genomes and that of the choanoflagellate Monosiga
brevicollis revealed that a major reduction of mtDNA has
taken place in the animal lineage, which involved the
translocation of mitochondrial genes into the nucleus and
dramatic size reduction of intergenic regions (IGR) [2].
Indeed, the IGRs account for almost 50% of the 76 kb mt
genome of M. brevicollis [3], while the poriferan genomes
examined so far from Demospongiae, Homoscleromorpha and Hexactinellida (no mt genome is yet available for
class Calcarea) possess less than 24% IGRs (in Axinella corrugata [4]). Similarly, the number of genes is reduced from
55 in M. brevicollis [3] to 40 - 18 in demosponges [5]. This
diminution of mt DNA culminates in bilaterian animals,
where IGRs are frequently absent (with adjacent genes
often overlapping each other) and occasionally genes
being lost. As a result, the majority of non-coding nucleotides in bilaterian mt genomes is located in a single control region, which contains important elements for the
replication of mtDNA (see [6] for an overview). Although
such control region has not unambiguously been identified in non-bilaterian Metazoa, some characteristic features like repetitive sequences [7], conserved sequence
blocks and potential secondary structures for the initiation of replication [8] have been found in the mt genome
of Acropora tenuis (Cnidaria [9]). In Porifera, non-coding
regions with repetitive features are speculative control
regions, but similarity to their eumetazoan counterparts
and conservation among different species are low [10,11].
The structure and biological function of mt genes is wellstudied owing to their pivotal role in respiration and oxidative phosphorylation and several of these genes are frequently used as phylogenetic markers. By contrast,
elements involved in the replication and expression of
mtDNA have been investigated only in a few species [8].
However, it has been observed that mtDNA outside of
bilaterian animals usually contains multiple IGRs of similar length and these genomes often harbour numerous
repetitive sequences [12]. Such repeats occur mostly in
intergenic regions but were also found inside protein coding or ribosomal RNA genes (e.g. [13-15]). These mt
repetitive sequences can comprise all classes of their
nuclear counterparts, which include direct-, dispersed-,
inverse-, tandem- and satellite-like repeats (see [12] for an
overview). Frequently, repetitive mtDNA elements have a
potential to form a particular secondary structure with
stems and loops. Conserved and potentially mobile palindromic repeats are well known from non-metazoan
mtDNA [16]. Most abundant are single hairpin-forming
motifs (e.g. [17]), but double hairpin elements were also
found [12,18]. In the following we will refer to such elements as Repetitive Hairpin-forming Elements (RHE).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/591

mRNA processing and translation have been discussed.
For example, inverted repeat sequence elements are often
found in the 3' - untranslated regions of mRNAs and have
been suggested as candidate structures for RNAse access
[19]. Alternatively, inverted repeats forming stem-loop
structures at 3' termini of mRNAs have also been found to
be stabilizing signals in both bacteria and chloroplasts
[20-23]. Besides their involvement in RNA processing,
repeat structures and, in particular, (double-) hairpin elements could facilitate recombination and lead to mt
genome reorganization. This function would be analogous to G-C rich clusters in the mt genome of S. cerevisiae
[12], which can be folded into several different motifs of
stem-and-loop structures with high similarity [24] and are
regarded as preferential recombination sites [25-28].
Finally, mt repetitive elements, like their cytoplasmatic
counterparts, could have simply evolved out of transposable elements or by errors during mt DNA replication
[12].
These insights from non-metazoan opisthokonts indicate
that mt IGRs may play an important role in the evolution
of the metazoan mt genome. To our knowledge there is no
information about the presence of RHE in choanoflagellates, Ichtyosporea and Placozoa. In Bilateria, the impact
of RHE was reduced concurrently with the condensation
of the mt genome to the highly compact circular ~16 kb
DNA molecule, as present today in most animal phyla. To
investigate the potential impact of RHE on early metazoan
mt DNA evolution, we studied the IGRs in all available mt
genomes from sponges, which form the basal divergence
with Eumetazoa within the animal lineage [29]. In this
paper, we will initially focus on the mt genomes of keratose demosponges (Keratosa), which, together with the
Myxospongiae, form the sister group to all other extant
demosponge lineages [5,30] and then extend our analysis
to other groups of demosponges and sponges in general.
The keratose sponge order Dictyoceratida encompasses
sponges with a high morphological diversity. Most genera, such as Hippospongia or Ircinia possess a purely organic
skeleton of spongin fibers. Recent molecular data, however, demonstrated that Vaceletia, a sponge with a 'sphinctozoan' -type skeleton, i.e. with a hypercalcified (so-called
"coralline") mineral skeleton of aragonite with trabecular
inner structure, likewise belongs to the Dictyoceratida
[5,31], a taxon that normally is devoid of biomineral-production. In this context we present the mt genome of an
additional non-coralline dictyoceratid sponge, Ircinia strobilina, which allows us to get a better insight on intra-ordinal variation of sponge mtDNA.

Results
Despite their regular occurrence in fungi, plants, and
other eukaryotes, no adaptive function of RHEs is known,
although their potential roles as control elements in

16,414, 16,755, and 20,658 bp, respectively (Figure 1).
They code for the standard 14 demosponge protein genes
(which include atp9), small and large subunit ribosomal
RNA (rns and rnl) but only two tRNAs (trnW(uca) and
trnMf(cau)). The latter represent the minimally required
suite of mt tRNA genes if all other tRNAs are imported
from the cytoplasm: trnW(uca) is needed to accommodate
for sponge (and mold and cnidarian) deviation from the
universal mitochondrial code [32] while a specialized
trnMf(cau) is necessary for the initiation of translation
(see also [33]). This reduced suite of tRNA genes is identical to that found in most Cnidaria [34]. All three mt
genomes display an identical gene order, including the
position of tRNAs. The selection pressures on the coding
genes is also very similar in these genomes as the ratio of
synonymous/nonsynonymous substitutions per site is
estimated as: Vaceletia sp. - I. strobilina: (0.30/0.03); Vace-

letia sp. - H. lachne: (0.27/0.03); I. strobilina - H. lachne:
(0.17/0.02).
Structure of intergenic regions in dictyoceratid
demosponges
Dictyoceratid intergenic regions show large length differences, resulting in mtDNA size variation of approximately
20% among the analyzed species. Vaceletia sp. possesses
IGRs totalling 4,520 bp, compared to 1,566 bp and 871
bp in H. lachne and I. strobilina, respectively. IGRs in the
latter two species display a high degree of similarity (Figure 1 grey vertical bars), which is highest at IGR termini
and decreases towards their centres. In Vaceletia the IGRs
connecting rnl - atp9 (700 bp), and trnM(cau) - nad2 (657
bp) are particularly long. There is no evidence for additional ORFs in any of these regions.

Repetitive elements in the IGR of dictyoceratid
demosponges
Several long duplications exist within the mt IGR of Vaceletia. Two IGR stretches of 339 bp between nad5 - nad2
and trnMf(cau) - nad2 are identical (Figure 1, red horizontal bars "red 339 motif"). Parts of this motif are also present
in other IGRs: rnl-atp9 (108 and 219 bp), atp9-cox1 (222
bp), rns-rnl (214 and 88 bp) and even within rnl (236 bp)
(Figure 1, red horizontal bars "other red motifs"). Another
duplicated region of significant length (219 bp) is located
in the IGRs connecting nad6 - nad3 and atp8 - atp6 (Figure
1: purple horizontal bars "purple219 motif").

These long repetitive regions are more than 90% AT,
which is much higher than for the other regions of the mt
genome (Figure 1, black curve under the Vaceletia mt
genome). A closer analysis of the AT-rich repetitive
regions reveals the presence of repetitive small, subunits,
which form perfect hairpin structures. Two different RHE
types have been detected: the first type consists of two
uninterrupted complementary regions of 15 bp each,
occasionally separated by 5 bases, which will in the following be referred to as "blue15" (Figure 1). We have
found 32 complete, i.e. hairpin-forming copies of this
type. The second type consists of two complementary
regions of 18 bp with a 7 bp terminal loop (Figure 1). The
Vaceletia mt genome contains 17 complete copies of this
type, which will in the following be referred to as
"yellow18". Besides their length, the blue15 and yellow18
complementary regions differ from each other by few
complementary substitutions. In addition, several incomplete blue15 and yellow18 RHE (i.e. without complementary region in close proximity) have been detected (not
shown). The blue15 and yellow18 RHE often occur in tandem resulting in double hairpin and, in some cases, multiple hairpin structure. Both hairpin motifs also occur in
rnl, while the blue15 type is also present in rns.
Compared to its homologues in dictyoceratid species
Hippospongia lachne and Ircinia strobilina, nad5 of Vaceletia
sp. possesses a 90 bp AT-rich insert (Figure 1: black vertical bar) with a potential to form a triple hairpin structure
(Figure 1, black box). Similar insertions have been found
in nad2 and nad5 of Axinella corrugata (see below). Considering the fact that they do not cause frameshifts it is
likely that these elements are not spliced out of the transcripts. Also, insertions in nad5 are not unusual in Order
Dictyoceratida - Ircinia strobilina possesses a stretch of 16
almost identically duplicated amino acids at the 3' end
(YVT(VW/GS)GIEYAEVPEYL), Figure 1, orange elements
"orange motif"). In the Ircinia strobilina mt genome this is
the only repetitive feature.
In contrast to our findings in Vaceletia, the mt genome of
Hippospongia lachne possesses only three repetitive motifs.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/591

The first forms a RHE type with a 10 bp helix and a 7 bp
loop in three copies (Figure 1: "green10"), of which two
occur in IGRs and one in rnl (Figure 1: green vertical bar).
In addition, a 31 bp long fragment of atp6 has been copied
into the IGR between the tRNA genes (Figure 1, "turquoise
motifs") and a 42 bp fragment is identical in the intergenic
regions 5' of rnl and cox1 (Figure 1, "brown motif"). Both of
the latter elements do not form hairpins.
Repetitive and other unusual elements in mtDNA of other
demosponges
Keratosa
Dendroceratida is sister order to Dictyoceratida - both
form the taxon Keratosa. MtDNA of the dendroceratid
Igernella notabilis possesses IGRs of 3,586 nucleotides. The
most remarkable feature of these IGRs is the presence of a
highly AT-rich RHE in 14 complete, i.e. double- or triple
hairpin-forming copies (Figure 2A), besides several potentially incomplete copies. Complete RHE copies are found
in all intergenic regions with the exception of cox1-nad1,
cox2-atp8, cob-nad6, nad3-nad4l, nad4-trnM, nad2trnW(uca) and rns-atp9, but twice between trnW(uca) and
nad5, and one such element is inserted into rnl.
Myxospongiae
Sponges of the orders Halisarcida, Chondrosida and
Verongida are combined into the Myxospongiae [30] and
form a sister group to Keratosa in molecular phylogenies
[5,30]. The IGR of Halisarca dujardini (Halisarcida) contains 1,328-noncoding base pairs with only one potential
RHE type, 17 bp long and GC-rich (Figure 2B). The RHEs
are located in the IGRs connecting cox3 - trnQ(uug), atp9 trnS(gcu) and, furthermore, inside a variable region of
nad2. Chondrilla nucula (Chondrillidae) does not possess
any remarkable repetitive feature in its 1,377 bp intergenic regions. Aplysina fulva (Verongida) has 1,478 intergenic nucleotides, with just a single RHE motif of two
complementary 10 bp strands. It occurs in two copies in
the IGRs connecting trnH(gug) - nad4 and atp6 - trnR(ucu)
(Figure 2C).
Marine Haplosclerida
Mt genomes of marine haplosclerids Callyspongia plicifera
(1,100 bp), Xestospongia muta (938 bp) Amphimedon compressa (887 bp) and Amphimedon queenslandica (2,413 bp)
lack RHEs. However, Amphimedon queenslandica (2,413
bp) mtDNA contains a 6× tandemly repeated 12 bp motif
between the two rRNA genes, a feature that remains
unique among Porifera [10].
The "G4" clade
According to molecular markers [5,30], the remaining
demosponge lineages belong to the clade "G4" yet to be
named and resolved. The mt genome of the freshwater
sponge Ephydatia muelleri (Haplosclerida, Spongillina)

possesses a large amount of intergenic nucleotides (5,242
bp IGR), containing RHEs with equal GC/AT- composition (Figure 2D). The most frequent RHE consists of two
8 bp complementary regions and is present 19 times in
IGRs and rnl. Occasionally, RHEs form a triple hairpin
structure. The mt genomes of Cinachyrella kuekenthali (490
bp IGR), Geodia neptuni (Astrophorida, 340 bp IGR),

birotulata. In contrast, Axinella corrugata (Halichondrida,
6,077 bp IGR) possesses a large variety of GC-rich (>70%)
RHEs, including double and triple hairpin motifs (see Figure 3). In several instances, these repeats are tandemly
arranged into multi-repeat motifs. Repeats reach a length
up to 84 bp and are present in almost all intergenic
regions of A. corrugata, as well as inside nad2, nad5 and
both ribosomal RNA genes. For Suberites domuncula
(Hadromerida, 6,519 bp IGR), numerous repetitive hairpin-forming features have also been reported earlier [35].
Three different RHE types with balanced nucleotide composition were detected with our search criteria, one of
them comprises 30 copies in different fragments sizes of
up to 40 bp (Figure 4). The Suberites domuncula RHE are
present inside rns, rnl and nad5 and in the IGRs 5' to
trnI(cau), trnK, atp6, trnR(ucu), cox3, trnQ(uug),
trnN(guu), cob, trnT(ugu), trnE(uuc), trnD(guc), trnR(ugc),
trnH(gug), cox1, trnS(uga), nad1, trnL(uaa), nad2, nad5,
trnA(ugc), trnF(gaa) and trnV(uac).
Repetitive and other unusual elements in mtDNA of other
poriferan lineages
Recent phylogenomic analyses suggested the presence of
four major extant sponge lineages: Demospongiae, Calcarea, Hexactinellida and Homoscleromorpha [29].
Hexactinellida
The mt DNA of Iphiteon panicea and Sympagella nux are not
completely sequenced due to the difficulties associated
with PCR amplification of a single large non-coding
region present in these genomes (see [36]), and hence
may contain a number of undetected RHE. Therefore the
Hexactinellida results have to be regarded with caution.
The sequenced region of Iphiteon panicea (Hexactinosida,
1,551 bp IGR) does not possess any hairpin-forming
repeat structures. Instead there are six repetitive regions of
about 30 bp, which make up in some cases almost an
entire IGR and overlap by 5 bp with the 3' regions of nad3,
nad4L and nad4. A full-length copy of such repeat is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/591

inserted within cob. This 3' region of cob is highly variable
and therefore potentially not relevant for the function of
the gene. Other copies of the motif overlap with trnI(gau)
and reside within orf909. Furthermore, several additional
repeat units are present in Iphiteon panicea, which share up
to 43 bp and a 7 bp core sequence. The complete mtDNA
sequence of Aphrocallistes vastus (1,444 bp IGR, including
one orf), another representative of the order Hexactinosida, does not possess RHE either. A large non-coding
region has been proposed to be a control region [11]. This
region contains several repetitive elements including a
single (not repetitive) 28 bp hairpin motif consisting of
two perfectly complementary 14 bp stretches, one 21 bp
complementary repeat and a 21 bp region shared with the
IGR upstream of cox2. Other repeated regions include
three identical (non RHE-) elements of 41 bp in rns, rnl
and the 5' terminus of cox2. The mt genome of Sympagella
nux (Lyssacinosida, 1.011 bp IGR) does not possess RHEs
in the sequenced portion, but contains a 117 bp repeated
region including trnD, of which a copy is present 423 bp
upstream between atp9 and trnM(cau).
Homoscleromorpha
The mt genomes of the homoscleromorph Plakortis angulospiculatus (601 bp IGR) and Oscarella carmela (1,275 bp
IGR) lack RHE according to our search criteria.
Calcarea
Yet, we lack any comprehensive information on calcarean
(calcareous sponges) mt genomes.

Discussion
Major morphological differences are not reflected in
molecular distances
It is remarkable that the mt genomes from three dictyoceratid species possess an identical gene content and gene
arrangement and contain several similar IGR regions,
because they represent taxa with very different skeletal
types. Vaceletia, a taxon with sphinctozoan-like (chambered) bauplan features a massive, "hypercalcified" skeleton. Sphinctozoan-type sponges were metazoans that
built large reef structures in the Palaeozoic and Mesozoic,
together with other coralline sponges that built massive
calcified skeletons with stromatoporoid, chaetetid, and
pharetronid grade of construction (e.g. [37]). Vaceletia
had been placed as the only extant genus in the order Verticillitida [38] and only molecular data revealed a dictyoceratid relationship of Vaceletia [5,31]. Among extant
organisms, Vaceletia is the only animal that possesses this
ancient sphinctozoan-type skeleton. Our data reveals that
significant morphological difference of the sphinctozoan
coralline sponge Vaceletia (with mineral skeleton), compared to the non-sphinctozoan dictyoceratids such as
Hippospongia and Ircinia (with an organic skeleton) is not

mt data (Figure 5). This is particularly interesting for
understanding molecular phylogenies comprising several
other extant coralline demosponges, which likewise construct a 'hypercalcified' secondary limestone skeleton in
addition to their primary (often spicular) skeleton [39]. In
the past, these coralline sponges had been lumped into a
separate sponge class "Sclerospongiae" [40], but were subsequently assigned to several demosponge and calcarean
orders, and are clearly polyphyletic [39].
The non-coralline Dictyoceratida Hippospongia and Ircinia
share a considerable similarity in IGRs, which may suggest
a more recent split between the two taxa. However, these
species belong to two different families: Spongiidae and
Irciniidae, each with a very distinct morphology: In contrast to Spongiidae, Irciniidae have very fine collagenous
filaments with beaded ends in the mesohyl, which supplement the fibre skeleton and are unique among demosponges [41]. Such a well-defined autapomorphy is
extremely rare among dictyoceratid sponges [42]. The

genetic distances of mt genes do not indicate a particularly
long evolutionary time for Irciniidae to develop this elaborated morphological feature.
The discrepancy between short branch lengths in phylogenetic trees inferred from mt data and a large extent of morphological divergence can have several explanations. On
the one hand, it is possible that the morphological
changes have taken place in a relatively short time span.
This hypothesis is supported by previous findings on Merlia normani, (Poecilosclerida: Merliidae), a demosponge
species known to possesses forms with and without a calcified basal skeleton [43]. The two forms of Merlia normani
provided important evidence for understanding that calcified skeletons are frequently homoplasious and therefore
weak characters for demosponge phylogenies [43]. Alternatively, the evolutionary rates in Dictyoceratida might
have decreased dramatically since their radiation (see Figure 5). Additional keratose sponge mt data are needed to
decide between these two possibilities.

Phylogenetic tree reconstructed from the protein coding genes of the mt genomes analysed. Phylogenetic tree
reconstructed from the protein coding genes. The coloured boxes following the taxon names comprise the numbers and ratios
of nucleotides in the IGRs. Green boxes: presence of significant RHEs; orange boxes; presence of repetitive elements in very
low copy numbers; red boxes: no RHEs; uncoloured boxes: undecided due to incomplete sequences. The numbers following
the taxon names indicate the GenBank accession numbers. Numbers on the branches are Bayesian posterior probabilities. The
asterisks at hexactinellid taxa denote incompletely sequenced genomes. Please note that the long branch of Hexactinellida
might influence branching pattern and higher support values (refer to [5,29,30]).

Reduction of the mitochondrial tRNA content in keratose
sponges
The Dictyoceratida and their dendroceratid sister taxon
Igernella notabilis retained only two tRNA genes in mtDNA
necessary to compensate for the derivation from the universal genetic code: trnW(uca) in the sponge (as well as all
other animal and many other eukaryote) mitochondria
translates the opal codon UGA that specifies a termination signal in the standard genetic code [32]; trnM(cau) is
a specialized initiation of translation (see also [33]). Cnidarian mt genomes likewise possess an identical set of
tRNA genes. However, reduction in the cnidarian and dic-

tyoceratid mt tRNA gene sets must have evolved independently given that both Myxospongia, the sister group
of Keratosa, and Hexactinellida, the putative sister group
of Demospongiae, possess a full complement of mt tRNA
genes.
Hairpin elements and the evolution of metazoan mt
genomes
Our study demonstrates that repetitive inverted repeats
with potential to form secondary structures such as hairpins, double hairpins or even more elaborate structures,
are found repeatedly in demosponge mt genomes. Their

presence in sponge mt DNA is remarkable because repetitive elements other than in the control region are hardly
known from Bilateria (see also [44]). This observation
underlines the intermediate appearance of sponge
mtDNA [10,45] relative to Eumetazoa, in which such elements are almost unknown, and to non-metazoan
opisthokonts such as fungi, in which repetitive elements
are abundant.
A correlation between IGR length and the presence of
repetitive elements is obvious (Figure 5): RHEs are more
common in sponge taxa with an increased IGR length.
However, an attempt to explain this correlation leads to
the Aristotle's 'Chicken or the Egg?' question: Long IGRs
present in most poriferan taxa provide more targets for the
accumulation and fixation of RHE, in contrast to the
greatly reduced IGRs in Eumetazoa. Insertion of RHE in
reduced and highly economized mt genomes of bilaterian
animals could almost exclusively take place in the coding
regions only (besides the control region) and would very
likely interfere with the functionality of crucial genes. As a
consequence, a RHE will less likely be fixed in the population. Vice versa, the accumulation of repetitive elements
causes a prolongation of IGRs, which reach up to 25% of
the total genome size in demosponges. Nevertheless, we
found many poriferan taxa without significant RHEs in
their mt genomes, but with IGRs of considerable length
(e.g. Agelas schmidti, Amphimedon queenslandica, Chondrilla
nucula, Negombata magnifica and Iotrochota birotulata),
which suggest that RHE are not the sole responsible elements for IGR length.
In a few cases RHEs are present in coding regions of the mt
genomes - mostly in ribosomal RNA genes such as rnl
(Additional file 1) and rns (Additional file 2), and less frequently in protein genes. Most insertions into ribosomal
RNA genes have taken place at sites, in which extensive
length differences have been reported earlier, and their
presence may not have a significant influence on the function of the ribosomal RNA (see [46]). Therefore, excision
of the elements out of the transcript may not be necessary
to maintain the function of the RNA in the ribosomes.
Studies with fungal mt double hairpin elements inserted
in genes revealed that RHEs are not removed from the
transcripts, which is consistent with their absence from
structurally important portions of genes [12]. Likewise
GC-rich clusters in the var1 ORF or in rRNAs of yeast mitochondria are neither removed nor edited at the RNA level
[47-49].
Taxonomic distribution of repetitive hairpin-forming
elements in Porifera
Our analyses leave the question of whether the distribution of RHEs in poriferan mt genomes has any taxonomic
preferences unresolved. It seems possible that some clades
are more susceptible to invasions of RHEs than others -

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/591

but additional poriferan mt genomes will be necessary to
test this hypothesis. So far, Keratosa (c.f. [30]) and, to
lesser extend, Myxospongiae (c.f. [30]) display a higher
abundance of RHE compared to the clades of marine Haplosclerida and the 'G4' group (c.f. [30]). In the two latter,
repetitive hairpin forming elements are only present in
Ephydatia muelleri, Axinella corrugata and Suberites
domuncula. For Hexactinellida, no unambiguous prediction is possible as only three taxa of two orders were investigated and two out of the three sequences are incomplete.
Homoscleromorpha, which is a species-poor taxon [50],
do not possess relevant repetitive structural elements,
which therefore might not occur in this group. However,
one of the two species of homosclermomorphs contains
two introns - another type of "selfish" DNA - in cox1 [51].
Repetitive hairpin elements are not uncommon among
demosponges and therefore putatively some could have
been present in (now extinct) taxa diverging earlier from
the lineage leading to the last common ancestor of Porifera. Furthermore, as ancestral mt genomes have likely had
larger IGRs, they provided more target sites for insertions
of RHEs within a mt genome, it is also possible that RHEs
were present in (now extinct) taxa diverging earlier from
the lineage towards the last common ancestor of Metazoa.
Subsequent genome compression in the lineage towards
Bilateria after the split of Porifera combined with the loss
of IGRs prevented the infestations of RHE in higher metazoan mt genomes.
The scattered distribution of RHEs that we observed in the
present study could either suggest an early origin with
subsequent parallel loss, or multiple independent invasions. The latter possibility appears more plausible given
the structural differences between RHE elements found
among demosponge taxa. Consequently, repetitive hairpin-forming elements may have invaded metazoan mt
genomes repeatedly during their evolution. They may be
secondarily lost again in some poriferan lineages, but are,
with the exception of the control region, mostly absent in
eumetazoan mt genomes due to their compact organization with subsequent loss of the preferred target sites
within the IGRs (but see also [44]).
Evolution of repetitive hairpin-forming elements in
Porifera
Large differences in secondary structures and nucleotide
composition observed in RHEs of sponges suggest their
independent origin and evolution. RHEs in the keratose
sponges Vaceletia, Hippospongia and Igernella have an
extremely high AT content. Both "yellow18" and "blue15"
motifs in Vaceletia mtDNA likely have a common origin.
It is possible that the short fraction of the "yellow18" type
RHE evolved into the "blue15" type RHE, of which subsequently several copies independently inserted into other
parts of the Vaceletia mt genome. Apparent double hairPage 10 of 14

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:591

pins (which are known from other genomes) are likewise
formed by tandem insertion of "blue15" and/or "yellow18"
RHEs into the mt genome.
The stem regions of both, "blue15" and "yellow18" RHE
types are conserved, while the loop regions display a few
differences. We interpret this as an indication of either
their recent origin and rapid spread through the genome
or considerable pressure for maintaining a hairpin secondary structure and note that this pattern is in contrast
with other structured RNAs, such as group I and group II
introns [52,53], in which the loops tend to be more conserved than the helical regions [12]. This lack of sequence
conservation in the loops in demosponge hairpin elements suggests their lack of structural importance and
their unlikely involvement in any tertiary interactions
[12]. This observation is supported by the substitution
pattern in large repetitive, triple hairpin forming regions
of Igernella notabilis, in which helix regions are also conserved and substitutions only occur in the loop regions.
The RHE found in other demosponges have a higher GCcontent. In particular, the stem regions of RHE in
Halisarca dujardini are up to 100% G+C. Substitutions
only occur at the loop positions, which parallels to the
structural constraints observed in the keratose RHE.
The lack of similarity between the RHE of different sponge
taxa implies that they infested the mt genome in multiple,
independent events rather than in a single infestation followed by proliferation into different elements. This inference is supported by the abundance of structural different
repetitive hairpin-forming elements in fungi and other
non-metazoan opisthokonts. In particular, the distinction
into GC-rich and AT-rich elements raises evidence for at
least two, but probably more infestation events in Porifera. This is consistent with many earlier observations that
well-distinguishable structure forming repetitive elements
are frequently confined to groups of closely related species, where the distribution indicates direct exchange of
genetic material (see [12] for examples, but also for evidence for mobility).
The relatively conserved structures of sponge RHEs within
the individual mt genomes suggest their recent multiplication and dispersal throughout the mt genome. However,
we also have to consider that alternatively, reduced substitution rates in diploblast mt genomes, which are up to 1020 times lower than their bilaterian counterparts [54] may
contribute to the low number of base substitutions
observed between copies of each element.
Proliferation of repetitive hairpin-forming elements within
poriferan mt genomes
The extensive repetitive and secondary-structure-forming
regions in the Vaceletia mt genome provide insight into

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/591

the intra-genomic dispersal of the hairpin elements. The
large identical IRG clusters indicate that the hairpin elements are not necessarily only copied as single elements.
Instead, larger motifs such as the 399 bp repetitive region
("red399 motif", Figure 1) are likewise duplicated and
inserted at different positions of the mt genome. Shorter
fragments with high sequence identity to those fragments
such as the 236 and 219 bp ("red motifs") fragment might
be derived from a copy of the 339 bp counterpart and subsequently reduced after insertion as full length elements.
The spread of RHEs in Vaceletia was apparently a rapid
process compared to (and probably largely independent
from) other genomic changes like substitutions and rearrangements in the gene order as evident by comparing the
mt genomes of Vaceletia and Ircinia. The latter genome has
an identical gene arrangement, but completely lacks
RHEs.
Evidence for lateral transfer and inter-genomic mobility of
repetitive hairpin elements could not be found due to the
lack of sufficient population samples. In non-metazoan
taxa inter-genomic mobility of RHE was hypothesized
e.g., for fungi of the genus Allomyces, where closely related
species possess different frequencies of RHE insertions
[12] in congruence to previous observations in rice [16]
and yeast [13,14]. Mechanisms for mobility of RHE may
be different. Mobility of the yeast RHE, located in GC-rich
clusters, is believed to happen by means of transposition
at the DNA level similar to DNA transposons [14]. By contrast, a different mode of transposition, potentially via
RNA intermediates, has been suggested for the Allomyces
RHEs because of the lack of duplications in the flanking
regions typical for DNA-transpositions [12]. For Porifera,
the lack of mt sequences of closely related species yet prevents speculation on their RHE transposition mechanisms.

Conclusion
Several poriferan mt genomes possess large IGRs, which
are target sites for repetitive hairpin elements. RHEs themselves also contribute to the large size variation found
among sponge mt genomes. Their scattered distribution
and dissimilar structure strongly suggests multiple independent invasions of RHEs instead of a single ancestral
event with subsequent loss in some lineages. Additionally, the presence of RHE- clusters in Vaceletia sp. implies
a rapid proliferation in combination with intra-genomic
mobility of such motifs.
As RHEs are not uncommon among extant demosponges,
occasional RHE invasions might also have occurred in
(now extinct) taxa diverging earlier from the lineage leading to the last common ancestor of Porifera. Furthermore,
as ancestral mt genomes were probably richer in IGRs, and
therefore provided more target sites for insertion of RHEs,
it is likely that occasional RHEs infestations already

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:591

occurred very early in metazoan mt genome evolution
(and affected now extinct lineages). Subsequent genome
compression in the lineage towards Bilateria after the split
of Porifera combined with the loss of IGRs lead to the loss
of RHE in eumetazoan mtDNA.
The mt genomes of Dictyoceratida provide information
on metazoan mt genome evolution. The high nucleotide
and structural similarity of the dictyoceratid mt genomes
is opposed to the different morphology of its taxa, which
must be accounted for in evolutionary studies on other
poriferan groups with a similar degree of morphological
differences.

Methods
Ircinia strobilina was collected by Robert Thacker at the
Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute's Bocas del Toro
Research Station in Panama. Total DNA of Ircinia strobilina
was extracted from ~0.2 g of tissue with a phenol- chloroform method modified from [55]. Porifera-optimized
conserved primers for cox1 and cox2 [5] were used to
amplify short fragments of these genes. Two species-specific primers were designed for each gene (is-cox1-f1, 5'GGGAATAAGTTGAACTCGACTGC-3', is-cox1-r1, 5'-TACCGATAGACACCATGGCATAC-3', is-cox2-f1, 5'-AGAGGTGGACAACAGACTATTGC-3',
and
is-cox2-r1,
5'TGATTTAATCTCCCTGGCACTGC-3')
and
complete
mtDNA was amplified in two fragments ~6 and 10.5 kbp
in size using the Long and Accurate (LA) PCR kit from
TAKARA. The PCR amplifications were combined in equimolar concentration, sheared into pieces 1-2 kb in size
and cloned using the TOPO® Shotgun Subcloning Kit
from Invitrogen. Colonies containing inserts were collected, grown overnight in 96-well blocks and submitted
to the DNA Sequencing and Synthesis Facility of the ISU
Office of Biotechnology for high-throughput plasmid
preparation and sequencing. The STADEN program suite
[56,57] was used to basecall and to assemble the
sequences. Gaps in the assembly were filled by primerwalking using original PCR amplifications as templates.
The repeats observed were too short to interfere negatively
with the assembly process; see [58] also for other details
of the shotgun plastid sequencing procedure. tRNA genes
were identified with the tRNAscan-SE program [59]; other
genes were identified by similarity searches in GenBank at
NCBI using the BLAST network service [60]. The sequence
of Ircinia strobilina is deposited to Genbank under accession number GQ337013.
For the phylogenetic reconstructions protein data of
sponge mtDNA was aligned following previously published methods e.g. [5]: amino acid sequences of individual proteins (except atp8) were aligned three times with
ClustalW 1.82 [61] using different combinations of opening/extension gap penalties: 10/0.2 (default), 12/4 and 5/

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/591

1. The three alignments were compared using SOAP [62],
and only positions that were identical among them were
included in phylogenetic analyses. The final alignment
comprised 3,576 amino acids. The phylogenetic tree of
Ircinia strobilina and other complete mt genomes of Porifera (GenBank accession numbers have been incorporated
into Figure 5) has been reconstructed with PHYLOBAYES
2.3 under the CAT + Γ model [63] with 4 chains and every
100th tree sampled after a burn-in of 1000. More than
9000 trees where sampled from each chain and the largest
(maxdiff) and mean (meandiff) discrepancy observed
across all bipartitions were maxdiff: 0.103701, meandiff:
0.00459985, which constitutes a good run according to
the PHYLOBAYES manual. The rates of synonymous/nonsynonymous codon substitution rates were estimated
with PAML 4.1 [64].
Artemis 9.0 [65] was used for genome visualization and
handling, Codoncode Aligner v.2.0.6 http://www.codon
code.com for alignment. Repetitive features have been
screened using PILER v.1 in combination with PALS v.1
[66]. In order to minimize false positives, but to perform
sufficient thorough analyses we screened for motifs of at
least 13 bp lengths with 95% identity. Positive hits were
compared against GenBank with blastN [67] in order to
find evidence for functionality or relationship to other
published DNA fragments. RHE secondary structures were
initially inferred under minimum free energy predictions
from the mfold-server http://frontend.bioinfo.rpi.edu/
applications/mfold/cgi-bin/rna-form1.cgi.
