Abstract
Background: Non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are large multimodular enzymes that
synthesize a wide range of biologically active natural peptide compounds, of which many are
pharmacologically important. Peptide bond formation is catalyzed by the Condensation (C) domain.
Various functional subtypes of the C domain exist: An LCL domain catalyzes a peptide bond between two
L-amino acids, a DCL domain links an L-amino acid to a growing peptide ending with a D-amino acid, a
Starter C domain (first denominated and classified as a separate subtype here) acylates the first amino acid
with a β-hydroxy-carboxylic acid (typically a β-hydroxyl fatty acid), and Heterocyclization (Cyc) domains
catalyze both peptide bond formation and subsequent cyclization of cysteine, serine or threonine residues.
The homologous Epimerization (E) domain flips the chirality of the last amino acid in the growing peptide;
Dual E/C domains catalyze both epimerization and condensation.
Results: In this paper, we report on the reconstruction of the phylogenetic relationship of NRPS C
domain subtypes and analyze in detail the sequence motifs of recently discovered subtypes (Dual E/C, DCL
and Starter domains) and their characteristic sequence differences, mutually and in comparison with LCL
domains. Based on their phylogeny and the comparison of their sequence motifs, LCL and Starter domains
appear to be more closely related to each other than to other subtypes, though pronounced differences
in some segments of the protein account for the unequal donor substrates (amino vs. β-hydroxycarboxylic acid). Furthermore, on the basis of phylogeny and the comparison of sequence motifs, we
conclude that Dual E/C and DCL domains share a common ancestor. In the same way, the evolutionary
origin of a C domain of unknown function in glycopeptide (GP) NRPSs can be determined to be an LCL
domain. In the case of two GP C domains which are most similar to DCL but which have LCL activity, we
postulate convergent evolution.
Conclusion: We systematize all C domain subtypes including the novel Starter C domain. With our
results, it will be easier to decide the subtype of unknown C domains as we provide profile Hidden Markov
Models (pHMMs) for the sequence motifs as well as for the entire sequences. The determined specificity
conferring positions will be helpful for the mutation of one subtype into another, e.g. turning DCL to LCL,
which can be a useful step for obtaining novel products.

Background
The biologically active products synthesized by non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are of interest for a
variety of reasons: Pharmaceutically, a rich collection of
them are used as drugs like antibiotics (e.g. penicillin and
vancomycin), anti-tumorals and cytostatics (e.g. bleomycin), anti-inflamatorials and immunosuppressants (e.g.
cyclosporin A), toxins (α-amanitine which is found in
Amanita phalloides (death cap)), or siderophores. Scientifically, it is a challenge to discover how these structurally
complex macromolecules are synthesized by the concerted interworking of the multi-domain proteins NRPS
and polyketide synthases (PKS) that synthesize a peptide
or ketide backbone with several other modifying and
"decorating" enzymes (halogenases, glycosyl transferases
etc.). NRPS belong to the family of megasynthetases,
which are among the largest known enzymes with molecular weights of up to ~2.3 MDa (~21,000 residues) [1].
They possess several modules, each of which contains a set
of enzymatic domains that, in their specificity, number,
and organization, determine the primary structure of the
corresponding peptide products; for a recent review on
NRPS, see Sieber and Marahiel [2], and Lautru and Challis
[3]. A complete module contains at least three enzymatic
domains (see Fig. 1).
The adenylation (A) domain specifically recognizes one
amino acid (or hydroxy acid) and activates it first through
the formation of an aminoacyl adenylate and then via
covalent bonding of the activated amino acid as a
thioester to the 4'-phosphopantetheinyl (4'PPant) cofactor of the peptidyl carrier protein (PCP domain, also
called phosphopantetheine attachment site or thiolation
(T) domain). The third compulsory domain is the Condensation (C) domain, which catalyzes the elongation

reaction of the peptidyl chain tethered to the phosphopantetheinyl arm of the upstream T domain to the amino
acid bound to the downstream T domain (reviewed by
Lautru and Challis [3]). This is why the first module of an
NRPS usually does not contain a C domain, but only the
second module has the domains CAT. The exceptions are
C domains, which we name Starter C domains; these
acylate the first amino acid with a fatty acid (with a βhydroxy-carboxylic acid to be precise as we will discuss
below). Chain elongation is terminated by the action of a
thioesterase (TE) domain. It is usually the final domain of
the last module in the assembly line and catalyzes either
the hydrolysis or the intramolecular cyclization of the
peptide chain, yielding a linear or macrocyclic product
[4]. Although the multi-domain proteins NRPS and PKS
are also found in fungal and plant genomes, most of the
known sequences stem from bacteria. The bacterial order
Actinomycetales is known for the wealth of secondary
metabolites produced by its members and comprises,
among others, Streptomyces species, Corynebacteria and
Mycobacteria. The majority of all currently known antibiotics and other therapeutic compounds are derived from
Streptomycetes [5]. Many members of Corynebacteria and
Mycobacteria are human pathogens which produce toxins
as secondary metabolites. The structural and functional
diversity of non-ribosomal peptides, unlike ribosomally
synthesized peptides, arises from the incorporation of
unusual amino acids: During the assembly of the peptide
backbone by the NRPS, both proteinogenic and non-proteinogenic amino acids (e.g. ornithine), including Damino acids, may be integrated and modified "on-the-fly"
by enzymatic domains within the NRPS protein. Possible
(optional) modifications of the building blocks (= amino
acids) are N-acylation of the first amino acid, epimerization (into D-amino acids), N-methylation, or cyclization
of amino acids (cysteine, serine or threonine) with an
amide-nitrogen of the peptide "backbone", resulting in
oxazolines (e.g. in vibriobactin) and thiazolines (e.g. in
bacitracin); these can be further oxidized or reduced by
special domains [2], and further halogenation or hydroxylation may be mediated by specialized domains. Occasionally dehydration is performed on serines, resulting in
dehydroalanine [6]. Further modifications – glycosylation
or phosphorylation – are usually performed by so-called
"decorating" enzymes, usually clustered in proximity to
the NRPS genes on the chromosome [2].
In this paper, we report on the functional variants (subtypes) and homologues of the Condensation (C) domain
of NRPS. All C domain sequences of this study were
extracted from NRPS that were detected in all available
completely sequenced bacterial genomes and a comprehensive collection of annotated biosynthesis clusters.
Besides A domains (and thioesterase II domains; see Sieber and Marahiel [2]) C domains also show specificity for

their substrates (see below). An in-depth understanding
of their function is thus crucial for re-engineering NRPS to
produce novel bioactive compounds. In practice, it has
been shown that it is possible to engineer synthetic systems for the production of novel products: Stachelhaus et
al. [7] demonstrated that domain swapping, which is the
recombination of domain-coding regions of desired specificity to a synthetic fusion protein, worked to create new
variants of surfactin and is thus one possibility, although
only one amino acid position in the product was varied,
which did not alter its activity, and the total yield was very
low (0.5 % of wilt-type yield).
Because C domains have been shown to have non-negligible specificity for the amino acid that is activated by the
downstream A domain, swapping whole modules or
insertion/deletion seems to be more promising, provided
that the integrity of the functional domains is carefully
maintained and the modules are dissected in their linker
regions [8,9]. Nevertheless, reduced catalytic efficiency
and product yield is a serious problem. A less invasive
strategy involves the manipulation of the domains' specificity by point mutations as demonstrated by Eppelmann
et al. [10] for the A domain. Therefore, an in-depth knowledge of all functional subtypes and homologues of the C
domains is indispensable. In this report, we reconstruct
their phylogeny and reveal the sequence motifs of all subtypes and homologues, and their mutual differences. The
insights gained will be helpful in future attempts to turn
one sub-specificity into another, e.g. changing the stereoselectivity of the C domain.
Furthermore, we have analyzed C domains and Epimerization (E) domains of glycopeptide NRPS. In these proteins, two Condensation domains preceded by former
(now inactive) Epimerization domains have gained opposite stereoselectivity, probably due to convergent evolution, for which we accumulate evidence. Additionally, we
discuss the origin of a C domain (often referred to as X*
domain) at the C-terminus of glycopeptide NRPS, which
is thought to be inactive.

Results and Discussion
Current knowledge of subtypes LCL, DCL, Cyc, and Dual E/C
The C domain has two binding sites: one for the electrophilic donor substrate (the acyl group of the growing
chain) and one for the nucleophilic acceptor substrate
(the activated amino acid). The condensation reaction
involves catalysis of a nucleophilic attack by the amino
group of the aminoacyl adenylate bound to the downstream PCP on the acyl group of the growing peptide
chain which is bound to the upstream PCP [2,11]. The
acceptor site of the C domain was shown to exhibit a
strong stereoselectivity and significant side chain selectivity. The selectivity towards a specific side chain seems to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/78

be less pronounced at the donor site which, however,
exhibits strong stereoselectivity [3].
In particular, C domains succeeding an E domain are
expected to show specificity towards the configuration (L
or D) of the C-terminal residue that is bound at the donor
site because the preceding E domain does not specifically
catalyze the epimerization from L to D but provides a mixture of configurations. It is the role of the C domain to
select the correct enantiomer [11]. Moreover, the C
domain represents some kind of selectivity filter in that it
supports the selection of the correct downstream nucleophile and prevents product mixtures [2].
C domains immediately downstream of E domains were
shown to be D-specific for the upstream donor and L-specific for the downstream acceptor, thus catalyzing the condensation reaction between a D- and an L-residue. These
C domains were termed DCL-catalysts because of this
behavior [12].
Accordingly, LCL-catalysts promote the condensation of
two L-amino acids. Both LCL- and DCL-catalysts possess a
conserved His-motif in their active site. The consensus
sequence of this motif is HHxxxDG where x denotes any
residue (see Fig. 2, motif 3). The second His-residue seems
to be essential for the catalytic function of the domain [2].
As a third type of C domain, so-called Dual Epimerization/Condensation (E/C) domains have recently been
identified. This finding was based on the observation of
NRPS which had products that contained D-residues
although the NRPS itself did not show an E domain in the
corresponding module. Biochemical experiments supported the hypothesis that Dual E/C domains exist which
are DCL-catalysts with epimerase activity [13]. In the
assembly line, a Dual E/C domain follows directly after a
C-A-T module which activates and incorporates an Lamino acid. The module which contains the Dual domain
also activates an L-amino acid. Then the Dual domain catalyzes the epimerization of the L-residue into D configuration and subsequently promotes the condensation of
those two residues. In addition to the active site His-motif
which is found in all C domains, Dual E/C domains
exhibit a second His-motif, HH[I/L]xxxxGD, which is
located close to the N-terminus of the domain [13] (It is
partly located on motifs C1 & C2; see Fig. 2.)
C domains may be replaced by Heterocyclization (Cyc)
domains which catalyze both peptide bond formation
and subsequent cyclization of cysteine (Cys), serine (Ser),
and threonine (Thr) residues. The five-membered heterocyclic rings which result from this reaction are important
for chelating metals or interaction with proteins, DNA or
RNA. Cyc domains are structurally related to C domains

Figure 2 C1 through C7 of C domain subtypes LCL, Starter, DCL and Dual E/C domains
Core motifs
Core motifs C1 through C7 of C domain subtypes LCL, Starter, DCL and Dual E/C domains. Compared to Marahiel
et al. [29], motifs are extended in both directions to include more significantly conserved positions. Yellow bars indicate significant specificity determining positions between LCL, Starter and DCL domains; those with red stars on top are the most significant positions. Numbers above the letter stacks indicate residues of functional and structural importance refered to in
Subsection "Key residues in Condensation domains" and Table 1.

and are supposed to be evolutionary specialized C
domains [2]. In Cyc domains, however, the active site His
motif is replaced by another conserved motif, DxxxxD.
Keating et al. [14] found that the aspartate (Asp, D) residues are critical for both condensation and heterocyclization.
Collected C domain sequence data and their phylogenetic
tree
A total of 481 Condensation domains (including their
homologues, Epimerization and Heterocyclization

domains) were extracted from 182 (non-identical) NRPS
and 31 NRPS/PKS hybrid sequences found in 62 bacterial
genomes out of the 256 bacterial genomes screened,
employing pHMMs as described in Section Methods
(Note that only one genome was considered for our analysis if sequences of several strains of the same species were
available, which reduced the number of NRPS or 'hybrid
NRPS/PKS' containing genomes from 62 to 43). Altogether 108 C domains were obtained from 42 NRPS
sequences from gene clusters downloaded from the UniProt database. After removing doublets, all 525 non-idenPage 4 of 15

tical C domains and homologues obtained were multiply
aligned and phylogenetic trees were built. The resulting
tree topology was clearly dominated by the functional categories that are known for C domains (as described in the
previous section), rather than species phylogeny or substrate specificity alone. The four main functions are: 1.
condensation performed by ordinary C domains; 2. condensation and subsequent heterocyclization catalyzed by
Heterocyclization (Cyc) domains; 3. epimerization followed by condensation which are both catalyzed by a
Dual E/C domain; 4. Starter domains (see below) which
are found on initiation (= first) modules and acylate the
subsequent amino acid.
Ordinary C domains may further be classified into LCLcatalysts and DCL-catalysts according to the stereochemis-

try of their substrates. The existence of all these functional
subtypes is reflected by the phylogeny. Fig. 3 shows a phylogenetic tree for subsets of each C domain subtype, as the
whole tree of 525 taxa is far too large to be displayed here
(see Additional files 1 and 2). The tree of all taxa showed
a similar topology perfectly reflecting the functional categories.
For further analysis, the different subtypes were examined
separately. While Cyc and Dual E/C domains could be
identified by means of their characteristic sequence motifs
(see Section Methods/Predicting of functional subtypes),
LCL- and DCL-catalysts were either distinguished according to their domain structure or by their position in the
phylogenetic tree. By this, 275 domains of all 525 C
domains were classified as being LCL-catalysts, 69 were

DCL-catalysts and 42 were Starter C domains (see next
section).
Description of a new C domain subtype: The Starter C
domain
When analyzing the Condensation (C) domain phylogeny, it became apparent that some domains did not cluster with the known C domain subtypes. A closer look at
the location of these deviating C domains revealed that all
of them were the very first C domain of the corresponding
NRPS assembly line. The remaining C domains of these
assembly lines appeared in other subtrees in the phylogeny.

Included in this set of starter C domains are those stemming from the biosynthesis clusters for the lipopeptides
surfactin [15], lichenysin [16], fengycin [17] and arthrofactin [18]. These lipopeptides are characterized by a βhydroxyl fatty acid which is connected to the first amino
acid of the peptide chain [19]. The peptide synthetases
involved in the production of these lipopeptides all have
a C domain as their very first domain. This C domain is
supposed to serve as an acceptor for a fatty acid which is
transferred from an acyltransferase [19]. This acylation
process has also been observed for surfactin [20] and
fengycin biosynthesis [21]. Moreover, common to the
Starter C domains of these biosynthesis clusters is their
low sequence similarity to the remaining C domains of
the same biosynthesis cluster [19].
The same has been observed for the synthesis of the acidic
lipopeptide CDA in Streptomyces coelicolor [22] and the
recently identified lipopeptide produced by protein
NP_960354.1 of Mycobacterium avium [23]. The Starter C
domain of the pristinamycin cluster appears to diverge
from this pattern at the first view. The C domain is the first
domain of the polypeptide SnbC but the biosynthesis of
pristinamycin is initiated by SnbA, which contains an A
domain that activates 3-hydroxypicolinic acid (3-hydroxypyridine-2-carboxylic acid, "2-hydroxy-6-azabenzoate")
but lacks an ACP [24]. SnbA is homologous to EntE,
which contains an A domain specific for 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate (DHB) and which is involved in the biosynthesis of enterobactin [25]. A similar organization can be
found in actinomycin biosynthesis. The process is initiated by AcmA, which activates 4-methyl-3-hydroxyanthranilic
acid
(MHA,
4-methyl-3-hydroxy-2aminobenzoate) [26]. In conclusion, what the C domains
of SnbC, AcmB and EntF have in common is that they catalyze bond formation between a derivative of salicylic
acid (2-hydroxy-benzoate) and an α-amino acid. Assured
by the fact that these Starter C domains match significantly well to the profile HMM built from the Starter C
domain sequences that process β-hydroxy fatty acids, we
compared salicylic acid with β-hydroxy fatty acids.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/78

Because both are β-hydroxy-carboxylic acids with no
amino-substituent at the α position, as a-amino acids
would have, we assume that this is the structural characteristic recognized by the prototype of Starter C domains.
The profile HMM built from all Starter C domains in our
data set (together with the pHMMs of the other domains)
presents a powerful instrument for exploring and understanding tricky NRPS domain-product relations.
Note that Formylation domains as found, for example at
the N-terminus of linear gramicidin synthetase subunit A
[27] are not C domains but belong to the Pfam "formyl
transferase" domain family.
Characteristic Sequence Motifs of LCL, DCL, Starter C
domains and Dual E/C domains
The different core motifs in Condensation domains have
first been described by de Crécy-Lagard et al. [28] and recompiled by Marahiel et al. [29] but have never been
updated since then. The core motifs of the C domain
homologues, Epimerization and Heterocyclization
domain are listed in the publication by Marahiel et al. [29]
but the sequence motifs of the recently discovered DCL
domains [12,30] as well as the Dual E/C [13] domains
have never been comprehensively analyzed. Moreover the
Starter C domain has not yet been recognized in the literature as a proper separate subtype.

The sequence motifs represented in Fig. 2 improve the C
domain core motif consensus sequences published by
Marahiel et al. [29] which, at that time, were based on
much fewer sequences and did not differentiate between
the C domain subtypes. The motifs are represented as
sequence logos [31] which make it easier to identify variably conserved positions compared to simple consensus
sequences. We adhere to the core motifs identified by
Marahiel et al. [29], and also show the surrounding "landscape" if there are highly conserved positions nearby,
especially if they are important for distinguishing between
the C domain subtypes. The motifs were built on the basis
of 40 verified and 198 predicted LCL sequences, in which
"predicted" means that they were classified based purely
on their position in the phylogenetic tree while "verified"
sequences were checked individually taking into account
their position in the succession of neighboring NRPS
domains, the presence of discriminative unique motifs
(see Methods Section) and/or literature information. For
the DCL motifs, 23 verified and 46 predicted sequences
were used, 7 verified and 35 predicted for the Starter
domains, and domains 9 verified and 47 predicted for the
Dual E/C domains.

Key residues in Condensation domains derived from the
literature
Based on three publications, four residues are likely to be
essential for the catalytic activity of the C domain. The
most important residue is the 2nd His of the active site
His-motif [32].

Furthermore, six residues have been identified as being
structurally important or as playing a role in correct folding of the domain. In the following, these residues are presented, grouped by their role (the numbering is according
to their linear occurrence on the peptide; see Fig. 2). This
information is also presented in Table 1 where the sites
are sorted by their relative position in the domain.

domains do not differ significantly in any of
the residues identified as being of catalytic or structural
importance (except residues Nb. 9 and Nb. 10). However,
using methods described in Section Methods, 20 positions in which LCL and DCL have significant differences
according to SDPpred [35] could be detected, plus 5 additional high scoring positions within the extended motifs
according to FRpred [36]. When comparing the different
motifs, motif C4 differs noticeably between LCL and DCL
subtypes. The same is true for the region downstream of
C4 (after the mutually very conserved TRP at pos. 184 in
VibH coordinates) where a moderately conserved motif
LPxDxxRP is seen in LCL which is completely absent in DCL
(see Additional file 3).
LC

L vs. Starter domain
While not being conserved at residues Nb. 5, Nb. 7, Nb. 9,
and Nb. 10, all remaining 6 functionally important residues are highly conserved throughout the putative Starter
domains. When comparing LCL and Starter domains, 18
discriminative positions were found by SDPpred and 5
more were found in the motifs by FRpred. Those positions
are highlighted in Fig. 2. Common to these residues is the
fact that they seem to be highly conserved among extender
(= LCL) domains but show no conservation among Starter
C domains. When we compare C domain sequence
motifs, it is apparent that motifs C2 and C4, despite being
well conserved in LCL, are unconserved in Starter domains,
which presumably can be explained by the much broader
structural range of substrates processed by Starter
domains.

What the phylogeny tells about the relationship of LCL vs.
Starter and DCL vs. Dual E/C domains
The reconstructed phylogeny of C domain subtypes
reveals that LCL and Starter C domains are more closely
related to each other than to other subtypes (see Fig. 3).
Comparing sequence motifs confirms this observation,
though pronounced differences in some segments of the
protein (especially in motifs C2 and C3, as can be seen in
Fig. 2) account for the unequal donor substrates (amino
vs. β-hydroxy-carboxylic acid). Furthermore the phylogenetic tree shows that Dual E/C and DCL domains share a
common ancestor. We tested the reliability of the phylogenies depicted in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 by repeating the reconstruction on biased profile alignments. These biased
alignments were generated by producing MUSCLE pro-

file-profile alignments in a step-wise manner, assuming
evolutionary relationships of the different domain subtypes that are contradictory to what the original trees suggest. The topology of the resulting trees supports the
shared ancestry of LCL and Starter C domains as well as of
Dual E/C and DCL domains. In addition, we generated an
alignment using DIALIGN [37], which is a non-progressive alignment method, and subsequently reconstructed a
PHYML-tree based on this alignment. Here also, the Dual
E/C and DCL domains are grouped together as are LCL and
Starter C domains.
Especially in motif C5, Dual E/C and DCL domains are
very similar to each other and dissimilar to LCL and Starter
domains. This observation of the relationship between

the four subtypes is consistent with the stereochemistry of
the substrates, bearing in mind that Dual E/C domains
function as DCL because the substrate L-amino acid is first
epimerized by the intrinsic epimerization activity of the
domain [13].
Within the subtrees of DCL and LCL domains, the tree
topology reflects the species phylogeny of the bacteria
rather than substrate specificity of any kind. We analyzed
this by reconstructing phylogenies for DCL domains and
LC domains separately to be able to see the topology
L
within these subtypes in more detail (data not shown).
The reconstructed phylogenies did not give any evidence
that would support the hypothesis that C domains cluster
according to their specificity towards the condensated
amino acids. This analysis, however, is based on the complete C domain sequence. A strategy to investigate
whether C domains exhibit substrate specificity would
involve predicting putative specificity determining positions using entropy and/or conservation based
approaches (e.g. SDPpred, FRpred), or inferring of putative active site residues by homology with the VibH structure (as done by Rausch et al. [38] for the adenylation
domain).
Enigmatic Glycopeptide antibiotic NRPS
Glycopeptide antibiotics are a subgroup of nonribosomal
peptide antibiotics of which the best known representatives are probably vancomycin and teicoplanin. To date,
all identified glycopeptide antibiotics are produced by
actinomycetes. They interrupt cell wall formation of grampositive bacteria by binding to the D-Ala-D-Ala termini of
the growing peptidoglycan, thereby inhibiting the
transpeptidation reaction. All glycopeptide antibiotics
consist of a heptapeptide backbone which is synthesized
by NRPS.

Modification reactions involve extensive cross-linking of
the aromatic side chains to rigidify the molecule [39,40].
The modular organization of some NRPS which were
identified in glycopeptide-producing actinomycetes are
depicted in Fig. 5.
All these NRPSs comprise seven modules. They show an
identical domain composition, with the exceptions of
module M3 in the A47934 (sta) and M3 and M6 in complestatin (com) clusters which contain an E domain not
present in the other clusters. The M3-E domain, however,
is assumed to be inactive [41], while the presence of an E
domain in com M6 has not been reported elsewhere so far.
We were able to detect it with an hmmpfam scan using the
specific E domain pHMM. All six NRPSs contain a domain
X* of unknown function. Until now, it has been characterized as an atypical C or E domain but its role in glycopeptide synthesis remains to be clarified. In general, it is

assumed that the stereochemistry of a NRPS product can
be predicted from its domain structure. In the case of the
known glycopeptides, the domain organization implies
the stereochemistry NH2-L-D-L-D-D-L-L-COOH, provided that the E in module M3 is inactive and that the X*
domain does not function as an E domain. This stereochemistry is inconsistent with the chemically determined
structure of the products: NH2-D-D-L-D-D-L-L-COOH
[41]. The assumption is that the A domain of the first
module activates a D-amino acid. For the cep cluster, however, Trauger and Walsh [42] show that the A domain of
M1 prefers L-Leu over D-Leu in a 6:1 ratio; but on the
other hand, they could not show which stereoisomer is
processed further. This suggests the existence of an
unknown E domain that acts on the L-Leu activated by
M1. With the discovery of Dual E/C domains, a new possible strategy arises for the incorporation of a D-residue by
the first module. However, no Dual E/C domain could be
detected in all glyco-NRPS. Alternatively, one could imagine an external racemase as is found in the cyclosporin
cluster [43], which provides a D-Leu that can be incorporated directly.
Having gained knowledge about the differences between
DC domains as described above, we

examined all glyco-NRPSs. When we reconstructed the
phylogeny of C domains including all homologous
domains from glyco-NRPSs, it was staggering to find that
all C domains were clustered in the DCL subtree and the X*
domain clustered in the LCL subtree (see Fig. 4). This finding could be confirmed by analyzing all instances of the C
domain motifs found in these domains. How could this
be interpreted, given the fact that M4 and M7 C domains

clearly act as LCL domains, as we can tell by the stereochemistry of the products? Our hypothesis is that those C
domains are former DCL domains that have developed LCL
activity by convergent evolution. Accumulating supportive evidence is possible: When we look at the phylogeny
of the C domains, the sequences of the com cluster from
Streptomyces lavendulae are always most distant from the
others and more closely related to the hypothetical common ancestor, implying that they can serve as a model for
the archetype of glyco-C domains. It is likely that in the
archetype, all C domains were true DCL catalysts, supposing that the E domains which are still present in com modules M4 and M7 were still active.
In a similar way, we can trace back the origin of the X*
domain: in the com cluster (and only there) it is followed
by remnants of an adenylation domain (which has several
larger insertions and deletions; see Additional file 4). This
tells us that the X* domain used to be the first domain of
a new module followed by an adenylation domain.

ple, one could think of mutational studies with the goal of
altering the stereo-selectivity of a DCL domain and to
determine the relevant residues experimentally. A starting
point could be, for example the M6 C domain of any
glyco-NRPS.
Glycopeptide-AB module M7 vs LCL
The second His of the His-motif in motif C3 which is
important for catalysis is replaced by Arg (R). Also, the Gly
of the His-motif is not present but replaced by Arg in all
but one X* domain. Note, however, that while the second
active site His is invariant in C domains, Gly138 is not.

SDPpred predicted 13 specificity determining residues
when comparing M7-X* to LCL-domains of Streptomyces
species. Only three of these coincide with residues of functional importance: His126, Arg278 and Asn335. Furthermore, a C terminal region could be detected in which M7X* and LCL differ strikingly. The concordance of M7-X*
with the most highly conserved residues of Streptomycete
LC domains supports the phylogenetically based suggesL
tion that M7-X* is an inactive LCL domain.

The assumption that the diverged C domains of modules
M4 and M7 would have adopted mutations at positions
that we have previously determined as "specificity determining positions" was disproved. Probably, a few spontaneous mutations in the DCL domains relaxed the stereoselectivity; supposing that this altered stereochemistry of
the product resulted in a highly selective advantage (arising from a vancomycin-like product), the loss of the functional E domains in M3 and M6 would have been a
selective gain. Comparing all M4 and/or all M7 C
domains with all DCL domains using SDPpred did not
reveal any significant positions; comparing them against
the other glyco-C domains gave thirty positions. As all
glyco-C domains are very closely related and differences
between them might also reflect substrate selectivity (not
only stereo-selectivity) or different inter-domain interacting residues, we cannot decide which of them confer the
altered stereo-selectivity. One point to notice however, is
a (positively charged) His in all M4 glyco-C domains at
position 6 in the extended motif C2 where an (uncharged
polar) Gln is highly conserved in other DCL domains. This
position has also been selected by FRpred as a significant
(= subtyping) position. The other positions do not represent mutations in highly conserved residues (data not
shown). It would be necessary to check their significance
experimentally with mutation studies. It would also be
helpful to compare the peculiar sequences with more
glyco-C domains, but others are -unfortunately – not publicly available.

In this study, we present the evolutionary relationship of
homologues of the NRPS Condensation domain which
include enzymatic domains catalyzing Epimerization,
Heterocyclization, Condensation and Epimerization with
subsequent Condensation in one domain (called the
Dual E/C domain). The Condensation domain itself
appears in three subtypes according to the stereo-chemistry of the substrates catalyzed: LCL domains, which condense two L-aminoacids, DCL domains, which condense a
D-amino acid (N-terminal part of the growing peptide)
with an L-amino acid, and Starter C domains (an expression that we coin here) which connect a β-hydroxy-carboxylic acid (e.g. β-hydroxyl fatty acid) with an L-amino
acid. The phylogeny of C domain homologues is reconstructed using NRPS sequences (including hybrid NRPS)
from completely sequenced genomes (43 genomes contained NRPS) and selected biosynthesis clusters, involving
525 non-identical C domain sequences. The sequence
motifs of LCL, DCL and Starter domains have been
extracted and are presented as sequence logos: for LCL
domains, this represents an update of consensus
sequences published by Marahiel et al. [29]; DCL and
Starter domain motifs are analyzed and mutually compared for the first time. For comparison, the homologous
motifs are also presented for Dual E/C domains, which
were first described by Balibar et al. [13].

However, although we could not discover which altered
positions are responsible for the functional shift from DCL
to LCL in glyco-C domains, interesting experimental questions can be formulated based on our findings. For exam-

We have investigated the "mysterious" evolutionary origin of C domains in glycopeptide antibiotic synthesis

the phylogenetic tree and show all DCL sequence motifs,
although they clearly have LCL activity. This suggests that
they might be an example of convergent evolution. Even
though this is probably a rare event, its possibility has to
be kept in mind when uncharacterized C domains are to
be classified, e.g. using profile HMMs provided as Additional files 5, 6, 7. Furthermore, we found that a C
domain-like segment of glyco-NRPS, called X*, is related
to the LCL domains and is followed by remnants of an A
domain, implying an additional complete module in the
ancestor of glyco-NRPS.
Roongsawang et al. [44] have already performed a study
of the phylogeny of C domains which compares the three
C domain subtypes. However, this study shows no awareness of the Dual E/C domain, which has since been discovered. Moreover, we used a much more comprehensive
dataset of C domain subsequences (525, as opposed to
Roongasawang et al.'s 162) compiled from all complete
bacterial genomes and biosynthesis clusters. Because of
the omission of Dual E/C domains, their conclusions
need to be revised, as we have shown.

Methods
Genomes and sequences
The protein sequences and GenBank entries for all completely sequenced bacterial genomes available to date
were obtained from the NCBI FTP site ftp://
ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/Bacteria/. In total, the
genomes of 256 bacterial species were downloaded and
screened for NRPS protein sequences (including NRPS/
PKS hybrids). Additional protein sequences of PKS and
NRPS which are part of known secondary metabolite biosynthesis clusters were obtained from the UniProt database [45]. NRPSs were retrieved from 14 known
biosynthesis clusters, of which 13 came from Actinomycetes and one from Pseudomonas (see Additional file 8).
Identification of enzymatic domains
A common strategy for the identification of a specific type
of domain is to use Profile Hidden Markov Models
(pHMMs), which are statistical models extracted from
multiple sequence alignments. In contrast to simple
sequence motifs of fixed length, i.e. position specific scoring matrices, pHMMs are suited for identifying motifs that
are interrupted by segments of variable length, and are
used to characterize position-specific sequence similarities within a family of proteins. A collection of pHMMs for
a wide array of domains and domain families is availabe
from the database Pfam [46] and TIGRFAMs [47]. The
pHMM implementation HMMER [48,49] and self-written
Perl [50] scripts and BioPerl [51] scripts were used to
search for NRPS in the genome sequences and biosynthesis clusters and to extract single domains from a given protein sequence. To identify a protein sequence as an NRPS,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/78

the occurrence of at least one complete NRPS module
with one C domain, one A domain and T domain was
required (Pfam accession numbers PF00668, PF00501
and PF00550), with an E-value threshold of 0.1 (thus we
accepted to miss freestanding starter modules containing
only A and T domains, or had to add them manually, as
in the case of the biosynthesis clusters).
The Pfam pHMM Condensation (PF00668) recognizes
both the Condensation (C) and Epimerization (E)
domain of NRPS. The intention, however, is to be able to
distinguish between these two domain types. Therefore C
domain and E domain specific pHMMs were generated
from a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of Epimerization domains and non-Epimerization domains, both of
which were recognized by the Pfam C pHMM. To obtain
a set of Epimerization domains, all NRPS sequences with
complete modules were extracted from all bacterial protein sequences in the Uniprot database [45] as described
above. Whenever two consecutive C domains followed by
an A domain were detected with Pfam pHMMs, the "first
C" domain was extracted. That way, we obtained a set consisting mainly of E domains (151 of 237 sequences). By
phylogenetic subtyping (as described below) we determined the E domain sequences from the phylogenetic tree
of the "first C" domains, which were forming a distinct
subtree. The E and non-E sequences were aligned with
MUSCLE [52,53], and specific pHMMs were build for
them with hmmbuild and hmmcalibrate from the
HMMER package (As a control, it was not possible to
detect E domains in the 771 "second C" domains). The
domain sequence covered by our own pHMMs for C and
E domains is identical with that of the Pfam Condensation pHMM; in other words it extends from four positions
before our extended C1 motif to the fourth position after
the extended C5 motif (these motifs were first revealed by
de Crécy-Lagard et al. [28] and reviewed by Marahiel et al.
[29]). Phylogenetic reconstruction is always based on this
part of the C domain (see Fig. 2). To extract the complete
N-terminal part of the C domains, we followed the dissections applied by Roche and Walsh [33] and checked the
secondary structure with Quick2D of the MPI Bioinformatics Toolkit [54,55].
Generation of multiple sequence alignments
The quality of a reconstructed phylogenetic tree crucially
depends on the underlying multiple sequence alignment.
All sequence alignments in our study were generated
using MUSCLE [52,53]. The alignment algorithm can be
divided into three stages. First, a progressive alignment is
built based on a UPGMA guide-tree. In the second stage,
the underlying guide-tree is iteratively improved, yielding
a new progressive alignment. The third stage involves
refinement of the tree: Based on the tree, bipartitions of
the dataset are produced; their profiles are extracted and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/78

realigned to each other. Thus, the finally generated alignment is not solely based on a single guide-tree, which is
why we can rule out that the phylogenies reconstructed on
the basis of these alignments merely reflect the guide-tree

tein. In this case, the type of the condensation reaction can
only be assigned if the order in which the proteins act in
the assembly line is known. To overcome this problem,
we checked all assignments with the classification suggested by the phylogeny.

Predicting substrate specificity
C domains catalyze the condensation of two amino acids,
thus, they have two binding sites: the acceptor and the
donor site. To be able to investigate whether the substrate
specificity of one of these sites influences the phylogeny of
the domain, the specificity of the preceding and succeeding A domain in the assembly line was predicted with the
NRPSpredictor [38] and stored for each C domain.

If the order of the subunits is unknown, temporarily
incorrect assignments can only be revised later in the analysis.

Predicting functional subtypes
Functional subtypes may be distinguished on the basis of
sequence features, domain architecture or clustering
behavior during tree reconstruction. Condensation and
Heterocyclization domains may be discriminated by the
sequence motif they exhibit at their active site. The occurrence of a sequence motif within a longer sequence can be
detected with the help of a position specific score matrix
(PSSM) [48]. PSSMs were generated and applied for the
detection of the active site His-motif of the C domain and
the DxxxxD-motif of the Heterocyclization domain. These
were used to discriminate between the two subtypes. The
His-motif was built from 86 sequences and the Cyc motif
from 15 sequences. The PSSMs were only applied to a
region of 100 residues which was expected to contain the
active site. In addition, a PSSM was generated for the Nterminal His-motif found in Dual E/C domains. It was
constructed from 55 sequences which had been identified
as Dual E/C domains by their clustering behavior in the
phylogeny and by additional visual inspection of the
alignment. The PSSM was applied for validation purposes
to make sure that this N-terminal His-motif is unique to
Dual E/C domains and cannot be found in any other C
domain subtype. Predicting whether a C domain is a LCLor a DCL-catalyst was established according to the
observed domain organization of the modules in an
NRPS sequence (DCL-catalysts were first described by Luo
et al. [30]). It is assumed that the role of a module with the
domain structure C-A-T-E is the activation and epimerization of a residue that is in the L stereo configuration with
the intention of incorporating a D residue into the final
product. Alongside this, a C domain directly following an
E domain is expected to be selective for residues in D-configuration, which is why it was assigned to the DCL-type.
All other C domains were assumed to be LCL-catalysts.
Classification as a DCL-catalyst is supposed to be fairly reliable. A false positive should only occur if the preceding
epimerase turns out to be nonfunctional. The LCL classification, however, is prone to errors when the respective C
domain is the very first (N-terminal) domain in the pro-

Analysis of multiple sequence alignments for specificity
determining positions
In a set of homologous enzymes, we may find subsets that
each contain sequences with one distinct substrate specificity. These subsets of common function are called subtypes and often vary at certain positions, whereas the same
positions may be conserved within a given subtype. Li et
al. [56] call these specificity-determining residues (SDR);
Kalinina et al. [35] refer to them as specificity determining
positions (SDP). To determine SDPs from an alignment,
calculating each column's mutual information is a possible way, as described by Li et al. [56] and Kalinina et al.
[35]. For this paper, SDPs were determined using the
freely accessible SDPpred server [35]. Here, the mutual
information is based on so-called smoothed frequencies,
which allow substitution of residues with similar physicochemical properties. In addition to that, the significance
of the mutual information of each position is estimated
by calculating Z-scores and evaluating their significance.
Predictions by SDPpred were compared with the highest
scoring positions predicted by FRpred [36,57] which combines a mutual information term with a conservation
score.
Reconstruction of phylogenetic trees
Several methods were applied for reconstructing phylogenetic trees from the multiple sequence alignments that
were generated for each domain type. Trees presented in
this article were reconstructed using protein sequences, as
amino acid sequences are preferred to nucleotide
sequences because they are more conserved and are not
influenced by compositional bias like G+C content and
codon usage. In addition, the mathematical model for the
evolutionary change of amino acid sequences is much
simpler than that of nucleotide sequences, which reduces
the risk that the phylogeny is based on wrong evolutionary assumptions, since just a suitable substitution matrix
has to be selected [58]. The amino acid substitution
matrix employed in this study was the Jones-TaylorThornton (JTT) matrix [59].

In some cases, the rate of amino acid substitution may be
assumed to be the same for all positions in the alignment.
In general, however, this does not reflect reality since the
substitution rate is usually higher at positions of lower

functional importance. A more realistic model is achieved
if the substitution rate is taken to vary among sites according to the gamma distribution [60].
Apart from PHYLIP [61], all methods used in this study
offer an estimation of parameter α which determines the
shape of the Γ distribution as an option. Whenever a
gamma distributed rate variation was assumed, four
gamma-rate categories were used to approximate the distribution. Several tree reconstruction methods were
applied to each dataset to determine whether different
methods yield different topologies, which in turn would
indicate that the proposed topologies are unreliable. As a
distance-based method, the Neighbor-Joining (NJ)
method [62] was applied. The distances were calculated
with the program protdist and NJ was performed with
neighbor, both available from the PHYLIP package. For
NJ, only uniform substitution rates were used. As a maximum likelihood method, the programs IQPNNI [63] and
PHYML [64] were applied.
Bootstrapping [65] was performed to test the reliability of
the topologies.
In general, a topology is taken as reliable if tree reconstruction results in the same topology for at least 95% of the
datasets generated by bootstrapping. This is a quite strict
approach and it has been shown that subtrees of a tree
may be accepted as being significant if they are supported
by only 70% of the trees [66]. Using the PHYLIP package,
bootstrap datasets were generated with seqboot and used
as input data for neighbor. PHYML also offers an option
that allows a bootstrap analysis of the original data. This
results in a set of trees which can be visualized as a consensus network using SplitsTree4 [67]. The specification of a
cutoff value allows a clearer view of the bootstrap tree/network where only those edges which are supported by
boostrap values higher than the cutoff are included.
Detection of sequence motifs and their representation
The program meme [68,69] was used to detect the
sequence motifs in C domains. Meme discovers one or
more motifs in a collection of unaligned DNA or protein
sequences. The C domain subtypes were aligned using
MUSCLE [52,53], the multiple alignments were visualized
using JalView [70] and the motifs found by meme were
extracted (cut out). It was ascertained that the C domain
motifs described by Sieber and Marahiel [2] were included
as well as remarkable sequence positions in the proximity
of the motifs, such as single conserved residues or positions which were important for discerning the subtypes.
The dissected motif sequences were used to create pHHMs
with HMMER and also to create sequence logos using
seqlogo by Crooks et al. [31]. Sequence logos were prefered over consensus sequences, as they provide a more

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/78

precise description of sequence similarity and reveal significant features of the alignment which are otherwise difficult to perceive. For sequence logos, positions with >
10% gaps were removed. Sequence logos of all C domain
motifs created with seqlogo are available online as Additional file 9.
