Abstract
Background: The kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) of trypanosomatids consists of an unusual
arrangement of circular molecules catenated into a single network. The diameter of the isolated
kDNA network is similar to that of the entire cell. However, within the kinetoplast matrix, the
kDNA is highly condensed. Studies in Crithidia fasciculata showed that kinetoplast-associated
proteins (KAPs) are capable of condensing the kDNA network. However, little is known about the
KAPs of Trypanosoma cruzi, a parasitic protozoon that shows distinct patterns of kDNA
condensation during their complex morphogenetic development. In epimastigotes and amastigotes
(replicating forms) the kDNA fibers are tightly packed into a disk-shaped kinetoplast, whereas
trypomastigotes (non-replicating) present a more relaxed kDNA organization contained within a
rounded structure. It is still unclear how the compact kinetoplast disk of epimastigotes is converted
into a globular structure in the infective trypomastigotes.
Results: In this work, we have analyzed KAP coding genes in trypanosomatid genomes and cloned
and expressed two kinetoplast-associated proteins in T. cruzi: TcKAP4 and TcKAP6. Such small
basic proteins are expressed in all developmental stages of the parasite, although present a
differential distribution within the kinetoplasts of epimastigote, amastigote and trypomastigote
forms.
Conclusion: Several features of TcKAPs, such as their small size, basic nature and similarity with
KAPs of C. fasciculata, are consistent with a role in DNA charge neutralization and condensation.
Additionally, the differential distribution of KAPs in the kinetoplasts of distinct developmental
stages of the parasite, indicate that the kDNA rearrangement that takes place during the T. cruzi
differentiation process is accompanied by TcKAPs redistribution.

Background
Eukaryotic genomes are packaged into the nucleus by histones and non histone proteins. Histones are small,
highly basic proteins that form a core around which the
DNA is wrapped. Although chromatin is highly compacted, its structure is dynamic, allowing access to the
DNA for processes such as replication, transcription,
recombination and repair [1,2]. Nucleoid-associated proteins have been described in archaea and bacteria. These
proteins resemble eukaryotic histones in their DNA binding properties, low molecular weight, abundance and
electrostatic charge. They organize and compact the
prokaryotic genome and are involved in various processes, including gene expression [3,4].
The proteins involved in DNA packaging in eukaryotic
organelles have not been fully characterized. In the protozoa of the Trypanosomatidae family, the mitochondrial
genome is contained within a specific region of the mitochondrion known as the kinetoplast. The kinetoplast
DNA (kDNA) of trypanosomatids is organized into an
unusual arrangement of circular molecules, catenated into
a single network. Two types of DNA ring are present
within the kinetoplast: maxicircles and minicircles. The
maxicircles resemble the mitochondrial DNA of higher
eukaryotes, encoding rRNAs and subunits of the respiratory complexes [5]. The minicircles encode guide RNAs,
which modify the maxicircle transcripts by extensive
insertions and/or deletions of uridylate residues to form
functional open reading frames, in a process known as
RNA editing [6]. The replication of kinetoplast DNA
requires a repertoire of molecules, including type II topoisomerases, DNA polymerases, universal minicircle
sequence binding proteins, primases and ribonucleases
[7,8].
The molecules involved in maintaining the highly ordered
organization of kDNA in trypanosomatids remained
unknown for many years. In 1965, Steinert suggested that
the kinetoplast DNA was not associated with basic proteins [9]. However, Souto-Padrón and De Souza provided
cytochemical evidence that the kDNA of Trypanosoma cruzi
was associated with basic proteins [10,11]. They suggested
that such proteins might be involved in neutralizing the
negatively charged DNA molecules in close contact within
the kinetoplast matrix. The proteins involved in kDNA
organization were not biochemically or molecularly characterized until the 1990s, following the isolation of kinetoplast-associated proteins (KAPs) from Crithidia
fasciculata [12]. The KAPs of C. fasciculata characterized to
date (CfKAP1, 2, 3 and 4) are small, highly basic proteins
with a composition similar to that of the H1 histone,
which contains lysine- and alanine-rich domains. These
CfKAPs have a cleavable nine-amino acid presequence in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/120

their N-terminal region that is absent from mature forms
and probably involved in kinetoplast import [13]. CfKAPs
have been shown to be exclusively restricted to the kinetoplast in immunolocalization assays and to bind to
minicircles and condense the kDNA network in vitro
[13,14]. Several roles have been attributed to KAPs in C.
fasciculata. They may facilitate the side-to-side association
of individual strands of DNA through charge neutralization and influence the orientation of the kDNA to facilitate interaction with specific minicircle sequences [12-14].
Further evidence of the involvement of KAPs in kDNA
organization in vivo was obtained by disrupting both alleles of the KAP1 gene of C. fasciculata. The double-knockout mutant was viable, but presented substantial kDNA
rearrangement, including a high level of kDNA fiber packaging and the appearance of a thicker layer in the middle
of the kinetoplast disk [15]. Surprisingly, this phenotypic
modification was found to resemble the effects of treating
C. fasciculata with topoisomerase II inhibitors [16]. The
inability of KAPs 2, 3 and 4 to complement KAP1 function
in kDNA organization is consistent with KAP1 having a
role different from that of other KAPs. Indeed, KAP 2 and
3 are involved in mitochondrial metabolism rather than
kDNA organization, as disruption of both alleles of the
KAP 2 and 3 genes increases the levels of several mitochondrial mRNAs, reduces respiration rate and interferes
with cell growth and morphology [17].
Despite some efforts to identify kinetoplast-associated
proteins in T. cruzi, little is known about KAPs in this protozoon [18,19]. T. cruzi is the etiologic agent of Chagas
disease and passes through several developmental stages
during its life cycle. Epimastigotes and amastigotes are the
proliferative forms found in the insect host midgut and
mammalian cells, respectively, whereas trypomastigotes
are the non proliferative forms infecting the vertebrate
host [20]. The differentiation of epimastigotes into trypomastigotes involves morphological changes, including
kDNA rearrangement. In the epimastigote and amastigote
forms of T. cruzi, as in most trypanosomatids, the kDNA
fibers are tightly packed into a compact disk-shaped structure. Conversely, trypomastigotes have a rounded kinetoplast, with a more relaxed organization of kDNA [21]. The
conversion of the kinetoplast disk into a globular structure probably involves a mechanism controlling the type
of KAPs associated with the kDNA or the extent to which
these proteins associate with the DNA network at different
stages of parasite development.
In this work, we have analyzed KAP coding sequences in
trypanosomatid genomes, organized them by means of
phylogenetic and syntenic analyses and defined two KAP
proteins distinct from those originally described in C. fasciculata. In addition, two kinetoplast-associated proteins

of T. cruzi, TcKAP4 and TcKAP6, were cloned, expressed
and antisera were generated against recombinant proteins. Imunolabeling assays revealed a differential distribution of TcKAPs in the kinetoplast of distinct
developmental stages of the parasite.

Methods
Cell culture
Epimastigote forms of T. cruzi (Dm28c clone) [22] were
grown in liver infusion tryptose (LIT) medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 28°C. Bloodstream
trypomastigote forms derived from the blood of Swiss
mice were used to infect the LLC-MK2 cells. Trypomastigotes were released seven days after infection in the supernatant and purified by centrifugation. Amastigotes were
obtained by disruption of the LLC-MK2 cells after four
days of infection with trypomastigotes. It is worth mentioning that the amastigotes released after disruption of
the cells are mixed with intermediate forms, which represent a transitional stage between amastigotes and trypomastigotes [20].
DNA extraction
DNA was extracted as described by Medina-Acosta and
Cross [23].
Genome search for T. cruzi orthologs of CfKAPs
The CfKAPs1–4 protein sequences were retrieved from
GenBank® [24] and a BLASTp search [25] was performed
against all protein sequences from trypanosomatids with
a complete sequenced genome, available in GenBank®
(release 169). All hits having an e-value lower than 1e105 were selected for further analyses. Sequences that were
redundant or did not contain a discernible nine amino
acids presequence, suggestive of kinetoplast import, were
discarded.
Evolutionary analysis of trypanosomatids KAPs
Multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) were produced
with the ClustalW software [26] and a phylogenetic analysis was performed using the MrBayes software [27,28],
running in parallel [29] in a 28 nodes cluster, by
20,000,000 generations, with gamma correction (estimated α = 6.675), allowing for invariant sites. A mixed
amino acid model was used and the Wag fixed rate model
[30] prevailed with a posterior probability of 1.0. MSAs
and trees were visualized with the Jalview [31] and
TreeView software [32], respectively
Cloning and expression of the TcKAP4 and TcKAP6
genes
Primers were designed to amplify the entire coding region
of these genes from the T. cruzi Dm28c genome. Primers

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/120

TcKAP4-F (from nucleotide 1 to 29) (5' GGGGGATCCATGCTCCGCTTTTGTCGGTCTCGCCTCGC 3') and TcKAP4R (from nucleotide 356 to 384) (5' GGGGTCGACTTAAGTCTTTTTCTTCTTTGGCTGCTGCT 3') were constructed based on the sequence with GenBank ID
XM_801968 and used to amplify the TcKAP4 coding
region, whereas the sequence with GenBank ID
XM_810849 was used to design the primers TcKAP6-F
(from nucleotide 1 to 21) (5' GCGGGATCCATGCTTCGCGTCTCCCTGCTT 3') and TcKAP6-R (from nucleotide 531 to 558) (5' GGGGTCGACTCACACCTTG
CTACGTGTGATCTTCTTG 3') for PCR amplification of
the TcKAP6 coding region. The forward primers contain
BamHI sites whereas the reverse primers contain SalI sites
(bold sequences). PCR was carried out in the following
reaction mixture: 10 pmol of each pair of primers, 100 ng
of T. cruzi genomic DNA, 200 μM dNTPs, 1.5 mM MgCl2,
20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 50 mM KCl and 2.5 units of Taq
DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). Reactions were carried out
in a GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems)
thermal cycler, with an initial denaturation at 94°C for 4
min, followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 58°C for 30
s and 72°C for 30 s. We obtained an amplified product of
0.4 kb for TcKAP4 and 0.65 kb for TcKAP6. The PCR products were purified with a high-purity PCR product purification kit (Roche), digested with BamHI and SalI and
inserted into the pQE30 expression vector (QIAGEN). The
His6-tagged recombinant proteins were produced in the E.
coli M15 strain following induction with 1 mM IPTG (isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside) and culture for an
additional 3 h at 37°C.
Purification of recombinant TcKAPs
The recombinant proteins were largely insoluble and were
obtained from the inclusion bodies. The pellets of cultures of E. coli expressing TcKAP4 or TcKAP6 (250 ml)
were resuspended in 10 ml of 20 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5
M NaCl and subjected to five pulses of sonication for 10 s
each at 4°C (Cole Parmer 4710). The sonicated extracts of
E. coli were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C.
The supernatant was discarded and the pellets containing
the inclusion bodies were washed three times in 50 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 M NaCl, 2% Triton X-100, resuspended in 4 ml of the protein sample buffer for SDSPAGE (Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis) and resolved in 15% polyacrylamide gels (20
cm × 20 cm × 0.4 cm) at 20 volts for 16 h at room temperature. After electrophoresis, the gels were incubated in
cold KCl (100 mM) for 30 min to visualize the bands of
proteins. The recombinant protein bands were excised
from the gels, electroeluted in a dialysis bag at 60 V for 2
h in SDS-PAGE buffer and dialyzed against PBS (10 mM
sodium phosphate buffer, 150 mM NaCl), pH 8.0.

Production of polyclonal antisera
Polyclonal antisera against the recombinant proteins were
produced in mice. The animals were immunized by intraperitoneal injection with 100 μg of the appropriate antigen in Freund's complete adjuvant (Sigma) for the first
inoculation and with 20 μg of the recombinant protein
with Freund's incomplete adjuvant (Sigma) for three
booster injections at two-week intervals. Antisera were
obtained five days after the last booster injection.
Immunoblotting
For immunoblotting analysis, cell lysates (1 × 107 parasites) were separated by SDS-PAGE in 15% polyacrylamide gels and the protein bands were transferred onto a
nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond C, Amersham Biosciences) according to standard protocols [33]. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubating the
membrane with 5% nonfat milk powder and 0.1%
Tween-20 in PBS, pH 8.0 for 30 min. Membranes were
then incubated for 1 h with the polyclonal antiserum
raised against the recombinant protein (TcKAP4 or
TcKAP6) diluted 1:500 in blocking solution. The membrane was washed three times in PBS and then incubated
for 45 min with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antimouse IgG secondary antibody (Sigma) diluted 1:10,000
in blocking solution. Bound antibodies were detected
with the BCIP (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate)/
NBT (nitro blue tetrazolium) solution kit (Promega). The
pre immune sera were also tested, as described above. The
antibody anti-polyhistidine (Sigma) was diluted 1:3,000
in blocking solution and used to confirm the expression
of TcKAPs in E. coli M15 strain.
Immunofluorescence assays
The parasites were washed in PBS, pH 8.0 and fixed by
incubation with 4% freshly prepared formaldehyde in
PBS for 30 min. Cells were deposited on poly-L-lysinetreated microscope slides and permeabilized by incubation with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS, pH 8.0, for 5 min.
The slides were incubated in blocking solution containing
1.5% BSA, 0.5% teleostean gelatin, 0.02% Tween 20 in
PBS, pH 8.0 and were then incubated with anti-TcKAP4 or
anti-TcKAP6 antiserum diluted 1:80 in blocking solution
for 1 h. The parasites were washed and incubated with
Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes)
diluted 1:500 in blocking solution for 45 min. The pre
immune sera were also tested, as described above. The
slides were mounted in N-propyl gallate and visualized by
confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss LSM510
META). For control assays, the incubation with antiTcKAP4 or anti-TcKAP6 was omitted.
Transmission electron microscopy
Protozoa were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde diluted in 0.1
M cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, for 2 h at room temperature

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/120

and post-fixed in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer containing 1%
OsO4, 5 mM calcium chloride and 0.8% potassium ferricyanide for 1 h. Then, cells were dehydrated in a graded
series of acetone and embedded in Epoxy resin. Ultrathin
sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate
and observed in a Zeiss 900 transmission electron microscope.
Ultrastructural immunocytochemistry
The parasites were fixed in 0.3% glutaraldehyde, 4% formaldehyde and 1% picric acid diluted in 0.1 M cacodylate
buffer, pH 7.2 and then dehydrated at -20°C in a graded
series of ethanol solutions. The material was progressively
infiltrated with Unicryl at lower temperatures and resin
polymerization was carried out in BEEM capsules at 20°C for 5 days, under ultraviolet light. Ultrathin sections
were obtained with a Leica ultramicrotome (Reichert
Ultracuts) and grids containing the sections were incubated with 50 mM NH4Cl for 30 min. They were then
incubated with blocking solution (3% BSA, 0.5% teleostean gelatin diluted in PBS, pH 8.0) for 30 min, followed
by incubation with anti-TcKAP4 or anti-TcKAP6 antiserum diluted 1:100 in blocking solution for 1 h. The grids
were then incubated for 30 min with gold-labeled goat
anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) diluted 1:200 in blocking solution, washed and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate for further observation in a Zeiss 900 transmission
electron microscope. For control assays, incubation with
the primary antiserum was omitted.

Results and discussion
Bioinformatic analysis of kinetoplast-associated proteins
in trypanosomatid species
As previously stated, originally five distinct kinetoplastassociated proteins were described in C. fasciculata, named
CfKAP1–5 [12,13]. However, the CfKAP5, also designated
p15, was never characterized. Since little is known about
kDNA-associated proteins in T. cruzi [18,19] and other
trypanosomatids, we sought initially to address this problem by examining genome database of the T. cruzi [34], T.
brucei [35], Leishmania major [36], L. infantum and L. braziliensis [37]. In a BLASTp search, using as query the available CfKAP protein sequences, we have identified 35
protein sequences related to CfKAPs: 11 in T. cruzi; 7 in L.
braziliensis; 6 in L. major and L. infantum; and 5 in T. brucei.
A phylogenetic analysis including these 35 sequences and
the five CfKAPs used as query was performed, in order to
construct a phylogenetic tree (figure 1). Additionally, a
synteny conservation analysis was performed, where chromosome location was highly correlated with tree topology, allowing us to infer the homology relationships
between the trypanosomatid KAPs [see additional file 1].

In the T. cruzi genome, we were able to identify the KAP3
and KAP4 genes, but not the KAP1 and KAP2 genes, which

were only identified in Leishmania spp. and C. fasciculata.
Furthermore, we were able to identify two other genes that
are similar to the CfKAPs, herein named KAP6 and KAP7.
They have not been characterized in Crithidia, as the available sequence information for this genome is limited
(227 nucleotide sequences in the current version of GenBank). The KAP6 gene whose size is compatible to others
KAPs, is more related to KAP4 (figure 1) and was annotated in all five genomes analyzed as "kinetoplast DNAassociated protein". The KAP7 gene, also present in all
trypanosomatid genomes, has been annotated as "hypothetical protein, conserved". Although it is clustered with
the KAP1 gene (figure 1), the lower bootstrap value of this
clade reinforces the uncertainty of KAP7 relationship to
other KAPs. The KAP genes of T. cruzi are present as two
copies, with the exception of TcKAP4c, probably due to
the hybrid nature of the CL Brener strain [34]- [see additional file 1].
Characterization of TcKAPs
In this work, we cloned and expressed two KAPs in T.
cruzi: TcKAP4 and TcKAP6. The PCR amplification of the
TcKAP4a gene generated a 387 bp DNA fragment encoding a protein with a predicted molecular weight of 14.5
kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence of the protein
encoded by the TcKAP4 gene includes 28% basic residues,
with a predicted pI of 14.5. The TcKAP6 gene is 558 base
pairs long and encodes a polypeptide with a predicted

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/120

molecular weight of 21.2 kDa. The amino acid sequence
of TcKAP6 includes 30% of basic residues and this protein
has a predicted pI of 11.3. The amino acid sequence data
reported here are available from GenBank under the
accession numbers ABR15473 for TcKAP4 and ABR15474
for TcKAP6. Both TcKAP4 and TcKAP6 have a clearly identifiable cleavable presequence in the N-terminal region
similar to that described for the KAPs of C. fasciculata and
potentially involved in mitochondrial import (figure 2).
These presequences are absent from the mature forms of
the proteins in C. fasciculata and with the exception of
their length, have all the properties usually associated
with cleavable mitochondrial presequences [12-14]. Similar sequences have been identified in the C. fasciculata
kinetoplast DNA polymerase beta, T. brucei hsp60 and
Leishmania tarentolae aldehyde dehydrogenase [38-40].
As reported for their counterparts in C. fasciculata [12,13],
the TcKAPs are positively charged and small, consistent
with a role in DNA charge neutralization and kDNA condensation in T. cruzi. The interaction between KAPs and
kDNA may involve nonspecific electrostatic binding to
DNA, interaction with specific regions of the minicircles
or both types of association. However, further studies are
required to investigate the occurrence of interaction
between TcKAPs and kDNA, and how these interactions
determine DNA network organization in T. cruzi.

Comparison of N-terminal sequences of KAPs from C. fasciculata and T. cruzi. The presequences predicted to be
involved in kinetoplast import are shown in bold type. The boxes indicate the highly conserved amino acids. Note that all
sequences begin with the sequence M, L, R. In all sequences other than those of CfKAP4 and TcKAP4, the fifth amino acid is
hydroxylated and the ninth is generally hydrophobic. CfKAP4 (PIR JC6092), CfKAP3 (GenBank accession number AY143553),
CfKAP2 (GenBank accession numbers AF008943 and AF008944) and CfKAP1 (GenBank accession number AF034951) are
KAPs from C. fasciculata whereas TcKAP4 (GenBank accession number ABR15473) and TcKAP6 (GenBank accession number
ABR15474) are T. cruzi KAPs.

Expression of recombinant TcKAPs in E. coli
Expression of recombinant TcKAPs in E. coli. The
TcKAP4 (A) and TcKAP6 (B) were expressed in E. coli M15
strain following induction with 1 mM IPTG for 3 h. Immunoblotting assays of non-induced (1) and induced (2) bacterial
extract using anti-polyhistidine antibody confirmed the
expression of recombinant TcKAPs.

Detection of TcKAPs in the distinct developmental stages
of T. cruzi
After cloning and expression, recombinant TcKap4 and
TcKap6 proteins (figure 3) were purified in order to produce mouse polyclonal antisera against them. These antisera were used in immunoblotting assays, to analyze the
expression of TCKAPs in proliferative and non proliferative stages of T. cuzi. Cell extracts of epimastigotes, amastigotes/intermediate forms and trypomastigotes were used
and both antisera were able to detect a single polypeptide
in all developmental stages of T. cruzi. The anti-TcKap4
serum detected a protein with an apparent molecular
weight of 16 kDa (figure 4A) and the anti-TcKap6 serum
detected a protein with an apparent molecular weight of
22 kDa (figure 4B). The molecular weights observed on
SDS-PAGE were slightly higher than those expected based
on the deduced amino acid sequences of TcKap4 and
TcKap6. This difference may result from the basic nature
of these proteins.
The kinetoplast ultrastructure in T. cruzi and distribution
of TcKAPs
The TcKAP antisera were also employed to determine the
subcellular location of TcKAPs in T. cruzi. It is worth mentioning that the kinetoplast of this parasite undergoes
morphological changes during the protozoon life cycle;
epimastigotes and amastigotes have tightly packed kDNA
fibers condensed within the kinetoplast disk, whereas trypomastigotes have a more relaxed organization of kDNA,
which is enclosed in a rounded structure. During the

transformation of amastigotes in trypomastigotes inside
the mammalian cell, changes occur in the general organization of the protozoa, in special in the kinetoplast structure. The population of intracellular parasites does not
differentiate in perfect synchrony, thus at a certain time of
the differentiation process, some transitional stages
between amastigotes and trypomastigotes can be found in
the same cell [20]. For this reason, the amastigotes used in
our assays, which were released after disruption of LLCMK2 cells, were mixed with intermediate forms. The kinetoplast of these intermediate forms is enlarged in relation
to the disk observed in amastigotes, presenting the DNA
fibers densely packed in the central area, but less condensed at the periphery. In order to analyze the distribution of TcKAPs in all developmental stages of T. cruzi, we
carried out immunolabelling assays using TcKAP antisera
in epimastigotes, amastigotes/intermediate forms and trypomastigotes. Both antisera specifically recognized the
kinetoplast of all developmental stages of T. cruzi (figures
5 and 6). However, the distribution of these proteins
within the kinetoplast depended on the developmental
form of the parasite. In epimastigotas and amastigotes,
TcKap4 and TcKap6 were distributed throughout the
kDNA network (figures 5A–H for TcKAP4 and 6A–H for
TcKAP6), consistent with findings for C. fasciculata, in
which CfKAPs are distributed for all kinetoplast disk
[13,14]. In intermediate forms (figures 5F and 6F, arrowheads) and trypomastigotes (figures 5 and 6I–L), TcKap4
and TcKap6 were distributed mainly at the periphery of
the kDNA network. In order to better understand the
kDNA arrangement present in the intermediate forms and
the distribution of KAPs in the different developmental
stages of T. cruzi, ultrastructural analyses and immunocy-

Distribution of TcKAP4 in T. cruzi. Immunolocalization of TcKAP4 in epimastigotes (A-D), amastigotes/intermediate forms
(E-H) and trypomastigotes (I-L) of T. cruzi. In epimastigotes (B) and amastigotes (F-arrow), the protein is distributed throughout the kDNA disk (insets). In intermediate forms (F-arrowhead) and trypomastigotes (J-inset), a peripheral labeling of the
kinetoplast was observed. (A-E-I) Phase-contrast image, (B-F-J) fluorescence image using anti-TcKAP4 serum, (C-G-K) propidium iodide showing the nucleus (n) and the kinetoplast (k), and (D-H-L) the overlay image. Bars = 5 μm.

tochemistry assays were performed (figure 7). In epimastigotes and amastigotes (figure 7A and 7D, respectively),
which present a disk-shaped kinetoplast, we could
observe gold particles distributed throughout the kinetoplast disk when both antisera were used (figure 7B and 7E
for TcKAP4 and 7C and 7F for TcKAP6). In intermediate
forms, which present an enlarged kinetoplast when compared to the disk-shaped kinetoplast of amastigotes (figure 7G), labeling of TcKAPs is more intense at the
peripheral region than in the central area (figure 7H and
7I). In trypomastigotes, which present a round-shaped
kinetoplast (figure 7J), gold particles were mainly
observed at the periphery of the kinetoplast network (figure 7K and 7L), confirming the results obtained by
immunofluorescence analysis. Preliminary cytochemical
studies had already shown different distributions of basic
proteins in the kinetoplasts of the different developmental stages of T. cruzi [41]. However, the reason for this differential protein distribution remain unclear. It is possible
that these basic proteins are involved in topological rearrangements of the kDNA network during the T. cruzi life
cycle, in which the compact bar-shaped kinetoplast is con-

verted into a globular structure. However, no data are currently available to confirm or refute this hypothesis.
In this work we showed for the first time that the distribution of TcKAPs in different developmental stages of T.
cruzi is related to the kinetoplast format: in disk-shaped
structures, like those found in epimastigotes and amastigotes, proteins are seen dispersed through the kDNA network. Conversely, in intermediate and rounded
kinetoplasts, like those observed in intermediate forms
and trypomastigotes, KAPs are mainly located at the
kDNA periphery. Taken together, these data indicate that
the kDNA rearrangement that takes place during the T.
cruzi differentiation process, is accompanied by TcKAP4
and TcKAP6 redistribution within the kinetoplast. It
means that TcKAPs could determine, at least in part, the
distinct topological organization of the kDNA networks.
Although much information is available concerning the
kinetoplast-associated proteins in C. fasciculata, it is still
unknown how KAPs and other proteins interact with the
DNA molecules to condense and determine the tridimen-

Distribution of TcKAP6 in T. cruzi. Immunolocalization of TcKAP6 in epimastigotes (A-D), amastigotes/intermediates
forms (E-H) and trypomastigotes (I-L) of T. cruzi. As observed for TcKAP4, this protein was also distributed throughout kDNA
disk in epimastigotes (B-inset) and amastigotes (F-arrow and inset), and at the periphery of the kinetoplast in intermediate
forms (F-arrowhead) and trypomastigotes (J-inset). (A-E-I) Phase-contrast image, (B-F-J) location of TcKAP6 in the kinetoplasts

sional arrangement of the kDNA network in trypanosomatids. Further studies using gene knockout to inhibit
the expression of KAPs or assays to over-express these proteins, would help us understand the biological function of
TcKAPs in T. cruzi and their involvement (or not) in the
topological rearrangements of kDNA during the parasite
morphogenetic development.

Conclusion
TcKAPs are candidate proteins for kDNA packaging and
organization in T. cruzi. The trypanosomatid genomes
sequenced to date have several sequences that share some
degree of similarity with CfKAPs studied so far (CfKAP1–
4). We have organized these sequences according to coding and syntenic information and have identified two
potentially novel KAPs in these organisms, KAP6 and
KAP7. Additionally, we have characterized two KAPs in T.
cruzi, TcKAP4 and TcKAP6, which are small and basic proteins that are expressed in proliferative and non-proliferative stages of the parasite. TcKAPs present differential
distribution within the kinetoplasts of epimastigotes,

amastigotes, intermediate forms and trypomastigotes,
indicating that the kDNA rearrangement that takes place
during the T. cruzi differentiation process is accompanied
by TcKAPs redistribution.

Ultrastructural localization of TcKAPs by transmission electron microscopy
Ultrastructural localization of TcKAPs by transmission electron microscopy. A-D-G-J: ultrastructural analyses of
the kinetoplast in the different developmental stages of T. cruzi. The kinetoplast of intermediate forms (G) is larger than the
bar-shaped kinetoplast of epimastigotes (A) and amastigotes (D). The trypomastigotes (J) present a more relaxed kDNA
organization, contained within a rounded kinetoplast. TcKAP4 (B-E-H-K) was distributed throughout the kinetoplast DNA network in epimatigotes (B) and amastigotes (E-arrow). In intermediate forms (H) and in trypomastigotes (K), TcKAP4 was distributed mainly at the periphery of the kDNA. The same result was observed for TcKAP6 (C-F-I-L). A homogenous
distribution for all kinetoplast was observed in epimastigotes (C) and amastigotes (F-arrows), while a more peripherical distribution was seen in intermediate forms (I) and trypomastigotes (L). Bars = 0.25 μm. k = kinetoplast, n = nucleus, bb = basal
body.
