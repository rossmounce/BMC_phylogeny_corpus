Abstract
Background: The 3,4-dihydroxy phenyl L-alanine (L-dopa) is a drug of choice for Parkinson's
disease, controlling changes in energy metabolism enzymes of the myocardium following
neurogenic injury. Aspergillus oryzae is commonly used for L-dopa production; however, potential
improvements in ease of handling, growth rate and environmental impact have led to an interest in
exploiting alternative yeasts. The two important elements required for L-dopa production are
intracellular tyrosinases (thus pre-grown yeast cells are required for the transformation of Ltyrosine to L-dopa) and L-ascorbate, which acts as a reducing agent.
Results: Pre-grown cells of Yarrowia lipolytica NRRL-143 were used for the microbiological
transformation of L-tyrosine to L-dopa. Different diatomite concentrations (0.5–3.0 mg/ml) were
added to the acidic (pH 3.5) reaction mixture. Maximum L-dopa biosynthesis (2.96 mg/ml L-dopa
from 2.68 mg/ml L-tyrosine) was obtained when 2.0 mg/ml diatomite was added 15 min after the
start of the reaction. After optimizing reaction time (30 min), and yeast cell concentration (2.5 mg/
ml), an overall 12.5 fold higher L-dopa production rate was observed when compared to the
control. Significant enhancements in Yp/s, Qs and qs over the control were observed.
Conclusion: Diatomite (2.0 mg/ml) addition 15 min after reaction commencement improved
microbiological transformation of L-tyrosine to L-dopa (3.48 mg/ml; p ≤ 0.05) by Y. lipolytica NRRL143. A 35% higher substrate conversion rate was achieved when compared to the control.

Background
The yeast Yarrowia lipolytica is a hemiascomycete and represents a homogeneous phylogenetic group with physiological and ecological diversity [1]. It is a nonconventional yeast, often used in research and isdistantly
related to Candida glabrata, Kluyveromyces lactis and Debaryomyces hansenii. Strains of Y. lipolytica can produce significant amounts of intra- or extra-cellular metabolites
including vitamins, lipases, storage lipids, citric acid and
pyruvic acid and can be used for biodegradation of vari-

ous wastes (e.g., olive-mill waters and raw glycerol) [2-6].
The 3,4-dihydroxy phenyl L-alanine (L-dopa) is a drug
used for Parkinson's disease, and is capable of changing
the enzymes of energy metabolism of myocardium following neurogenic injury. The process of bioconversion of
L-tyrosine to L-dopa in microorganisms is generally slow,
but is accelerated by a small amount of L-dopa in the
broth [7]. L-dopa has also been produced with Erwinia
herbicola cells carrying a mutant transcriptional regulator
TyrR from pyrocatechol and DL-serine [8,9]. It can also be

Tyrosinases (monophenol, o-diphenol:oxygen oxidoreductase, EC 1.14.18.1) belong to a larger group of type-3
copper proteins, which include catecholoxidases and oxygen-carrier haemocyanins [12]. Tyrosinases are involved
in the melanin pathway and are responsible for the first
steps of melanin synthesis from L-tyrosine, leading to the
formation of L-dopaquinone and L-dopachrome [13].
Tyrosinases catalyse the o-hydroxylation of monophenols
(cresolase activity or "monophenolase") and the ensuing
oxidation of molecular oxygen. Subsequently, the o-quinones undergo non-enzymatic reactions with various
nucleophiles, producing intermediates [14]. The immobilization of tyrosinases on solid supports can increase
enzyme stability [15-19], protect tyrosinase from inactivation by reaction with quinones, (preserving them from
proteolysis) [20], improve thermal stability of fungal tyrosinases [21], and increase activity in comparison to soluble enzymes [22].
Diatomite (2:1 clay mineral) is a naturally occurring, soft,
chalk-like sedimentary rock that is easily crumbled into a
fine, off-white powder which has K+ in the interlayer. This
powder has an abrasive feeling similar to pumice and is
light-weight due to its porosity. By adding diatomite into
the reaction, an increased substrate uptake and enzyme
production rate with concomitant L-dopa production
could result. We have previously reported the effect of
cresoquinone and vermiculite on the microbial transformation of L-tyrosine to L-dopa by Aspergillus oryzae
[23,24]. In the present study, different concentrations of
diatomite were added into the reaction mixture to achieve
a high performance transformation of L-tyrosine to Ldopa.

NRRL-143 was investigated (Figure 1). The concentration
of diatomite added at the start of biochemical reaction
ranged from 0.5–3.0 mg/ml, along with 3.5 mg/ml L-tyrosine. A biomass concentration of 3.0 mg/ml was used as a
source of intracellular enzyme tyrosinase in a 50 min reaction. The highest production of L-dopa (1.64 mg/ml produced with 2.90 mg/ml consumption of L-tyrosine) was
observed with 2.0 mg/ml diatomite. L-dopa production
fell while substrate consumption continued to rise, probably due to catecholase activity causing L-dopa to be used
for quinone production, since ascorbic acid (which inhibits this activity) was not being replaced in the system. In
some enzyme systems, disaccharides or higher molecular
weight substrates have been found to be the best supporters of intracellular enzymes [25,26]. It was hypothesized
that tyrosinase, a constitutive enzyme, was altered with
respect to production of L-dopa in the presence of added
diatomite.
The effects of delayed diatomite addition (2.0 mg/ml; 0,
5, 10, 15, 20, 25 min) into the Y. lipolytica NRRL-143 reaction were also investigated (Figure 2). Reactions were performed aerobically with 3.0 mg/ml cell biomass and 3.5
mg/ml L-tyrosine for 50 min. Production of L-dopa
increased from 5 to 15 min after the addition of diat4

A. oryzae is an organism typically used for L-dopa production. The easy handling, rapid growth rate and environmentally friendly nature of alternative yeasts such as Y.
lipolytica have created an interest in their use for fermentation. Because tyrosinases are intracellular enzymes, pregrown cells harvested from fermented broth were used for
the microbiological transformation of L-tyrosine to Ldopa.

Results and discussion
The production of L-dopa is largely dependent on the
addition of specific additives and minerals to the reaction
mixture. The inductive effect of diatomite on the transformation of L-tyrosine to L-dopa by Yarrowia lipolytica

to previous reports [26] in which the production of Ldopa was achieved in minimal medium without additive
supplementation (pH 7.0). Previous research efforts to
produce L-dopa by the addition of 0.16 µg vermiculite
during the reaction obtained 0.39–0.54 mg/ml of the
desired product [27].

omite; a significant decrease of L-dopa (1.68–2.14 mg/
ml) was noticed 20–25 min after the addition. Maximum
L-dopa (2.96 mg/ml) was obtained 15 min after the addition of diatomite into the reaction mixture, with concomitant tyrosine consumption of 2.94 mg/ml, a 35%
increase when compared to the control which is highly
significant (p ≤ 0.05). The L-tyrosine substrate has binding affinity with diatomite, which induces tyrosinase
secretion, improves its availability and ultimately leads to
an increased L-dopa production rate [7,11,13,24]. In our
experiment, the addition of diatomite 15 min after reaction commencement was identified as optimal, increasing
production of L-dopa, substrate utilization and time of
reaction. However, L-dopa production dropped (1.68 mg/
ml with 3.14 mg/ml L-tyrosine consumption) when diatomite was added 25 min after the start of reaction, probably due to conversion of unstable L-dopa to dopamine,
melanin and other pigmented products [10,13] after a
reduced availability of the enzyme.
The consumption of L-tyrosine, however, continued to
increase despite the time of diatomite addition. The tyrosinase active center is comprised of dinuclear copper,
coordinated with histidine residues, chelating substances
or substances that are associated with this metal (as are
quinones) which are irreversible inhibitors and/or inactivators of this enzyme [12]. The addition of diatomaceous
earth may remove these inhibitors and/or inactivators by
active absorption. The absorption of inhibitors increased
the enzyme activity of tyrosinases, β-carboxylases and

The time course of L-dopa production and L-tyrosine consumption was carried out at different incubation periods
(10–60 min) using a hotplate with magnetic stirrers (Figure 3). The control gave a maximum of 0.50 mg/ml Ldopa with 1.14 mg/ml consumption of L-tyrosine. The
maximum conversion rate (3.20 mg/ml L-dopa with 3.26
mg/ml tyrosine consumption) was obtained with 2.0 mg/
ml diatomite added 15 min after the start of reaction, producing a 72% higher yield of L-dopa compared to the control. The L-dopa production from this time course differed
significantly (p ≤ 0.05) with the results at all other incubation periods. It is clear that up to 30 min, cresolase activity
predominated and, given the non-replacement of ascorbic
acid, the overriding activity was catecholase, which consumed the L-tyrosine substrate without a corresponding
production of L-dopa. After 40–60 min of incubation, the
production of L-dopa and the consumption of L-tyrosine
decreased gradually in the control and test reactions. This
reduction might be because the L-dopa and residual Ltyrosine were changed into other metabolites such as
dopamine, melanin and eventually melanosine. Another
study [25] achieved 0.12 mg/ml of L-dopa, 90 min after
the biochemical reaction. The present finding of 3.20 mg/
ml L-dopa after 30 min of incubation is a major improvement. In the present study, dopamine and melanin were
also produced, but their highest production was 0.014
and 0.01 mg/ml/h.
Conversion of L-tyrosine to L-dopa is an enzyme catalyzed reaction. Figure 4 shows the effect of the addition of
different concentrations of drenched cell biomass (1.5,
2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5 mg/ml) on the production of Ldopa from L-tyrosine in the reaction mixture. The best
results (3.48 mg/ml L-dopa with 3.25 mg/ml L-tyrosine
consumption) were obtained using 2.5 mg/ml wet weight
yeast cells, leading to 10 fold higher productivity when
compared to the control (0.72 mg/ml L-dopa with 1.22
mg/ml L-tyrosine consumption). At this concentration
(2.5 mg/ml), most of the added tyrosine was converted to
L-dopa as indicated by the small amount of residual substrate (0.25 mg/ml), which is highly significant (p ≤ 0.05).
In the present investigation, the increased cell biomass
enhanced enzymatic activity (1.55 U/mg tyrosinase).
However, increasing the cellular concentration beyond
the optimal led to a sharp decrease in activity, probably

due to increased cell concentration (proportional to
enzyme concentration) and the maintenance of a constant concentration of an inhibitor of catecholase activity

Only an excessive amount of ascorbic acid continually replaced throughout the reaction might stop this second activity from taking place, leading to the formation of

Previous research [28] pointed out that tyrosinase activity
is directly related to the concentration of cells or mycelia
in the reaction mixture in slightly acidic to neutral reaction conditions. Copper atoms found at the active site of
tyrosinase are an essential requirement for catalytic activity. Agents such as carbon monoxide or toxins indirectly
inhibit tyrosinase activity by chelating copper and abrogating its ability to bind oxygen. Previous research
[8,12,13] has shown that tyrosine phenol lyase (tpl) is
only synthesized under L-tyrosine-induced conditions.
The addition of L-tyrosine to the medium was found una-

voidable when preparing cells (the enzyme source), but
severely impeded preparation of pure L-dopa [24].
A comparison of production parameters for the effect of
diatomite addition on bioconversion of L-tyrosine to Ldopa is shown in Table 1. An overall 12.5 fold increase in
L-dopa production (with 4.06 mg/ml proteins) was
achieved at the optimal level of added diatomite when
compared to the control. The optimal pH of the control
reaction without added diatomite was 3.5, however, the
test reaction with added diatomite was proficient at a pH
range of 2.5–4.0, indicating the enzyme remained active
despite the change in reaction pH. The Yp/s value (with 2.0
mg/ml diatomite added 15 min after the start of reaction)
was significantly improved over the control. Maximum
substrate consumption (Qs) in terms of volumetric rate
was marginally different during bioconversion between
the control and test reactions, indicating maximum
enzyme activity at this level of diatomite addition. The
increase of qs (i.e., specific substrate consumption rate)
with diatomite addition was highly significant (p ≤ 0.05).
In the present study, the optimal values of all kinetic
parameters (Yp/s, Qs and qs) were several-fold improved
over those reported from Aspergillus or Cellulomonas spp.
[7,10,28].

Conclusion
In the present studies, Yarrowia lipolytica strain NRRL-143
was exploited for L-dopa production. The addition of 2.0
mg/ml diatomite (2:1 clay mineral) markedly improved
the microbiological transformation of L-tyrosine to Ldopa. Diatomite addition 15 min after the start of reaction
produced a 35% higher substrate conversion rate compared to the control (p ≤ 0.05). A biomass concentration
of 2.5 mg/ml and reaction time of 30 min were also optiTable 1: Comparison of parameters for L-dopa production by Y.

mized. Because production of L-dopa is a high cost, low
yield process, scaled up studies are a pre-requisite for commercial exploitation.

Methods
Microorganism and growth conditions
Yarrowia lipolytica strain NRRL-143 was grown on yeast
extract agar slants (pH 5.4) and stored in a cold-cabinet
(Model: 154P, Sanyo, Tokyo, Japan) at 4°C. Two hundred
milliliters of cultivation medium containing (% w/v); glucose (2.0, polypeptone (1.0), NH4Cl 0.3, KH2PO4 (0.3),
MgSO4·7H2O (0.02), yeast extract (1.0) (pH 5.5) were
taken into individual 1.0 L Erlenmeyer flasks. The
medium was autoclaved at 15 psi (121°C) for 20 min and
seeded with 1.0 ml of yeast suspension (1.25 × 106 cells/
ml). The flasks were incubated in a rotary shaking incubator (200 rpm) at 30°C for 48 h. A biomass ranging from
18–20 g/l was produced while 0.25% (w/v) glucose
remained intact in the broth at 48 h of cultivation. Cells
were harvested by centrifugation at 16,000 rpm (15,431 ×
g), washed free of adhering medium with ice-cold water
(4°C), dried in filter paper folds (Whatman 44, Brazil)
and stored at -35°C in an ultra-low freezer (Model: UF-12,
Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan).
Biochemical reaction and critical phases
The production of L-dopa from L-tyrosine was carried out
in acetate buffer (pH 3.5, 50 mM) containing (mg/ml); Ltyrosine (3.5), L-ascorbic acid (5.0) and intact cells (3.0),
dispensed to a 1.25 L capacity reaction vessel (Model:
2134-nmn, Perkin Elmer, NY, USA) with a working volume of 0.75 L. Different diatomite (Sigma, St. Louis, USA)
concentrations (0.5–3.0 mg/ml) were added to the reaction mixture at different time intervals (5–25 min). Reactions were carried out aerobically (1.25 l/l/min air supply,
0.5% dissolved oxygen) on a digital hot plate with magnetic stirrers (Model: G542i, Inolab, Bonn, Germany) at
50°C for different time intervals (10–60 min). The level
of dissolved oxygen (DO) was measured using a Rota
meter equipped with a DO-sensor (Model: RM10, Inolab,
Bonn, Germany).
Assay methods
The mixture was withdrawn from each reaction vessel,
centrifuged at 9,000 rpm (8,332 × g) for 15 min and the
clear supernatant was kept in the dark at ambient temperature (~20°C).
Determination of tyrosinase activity
Tyrosinase activity was determined following a previously
described method [29]. Briefly, potassium phosphate
buffer (2.60 ml, 50 mM), 0.10 ml L-catechol, 0.10 ml Lascorbic acid and 0.10 ml EDTA were mixed by inversion
and equilibrated to 25°C. The ∆A265 nm was monitored
until constant, followed by the addition of 100 µl of reac-

tion broth. The decrease in ∆A265 nm was recorded for
approximately 5 min. The ∆A265 nm was obtained using the
maximum linear rate for both the test and control.
Enzyme activity was determined with the following formula,
Units/mg enzyme =

ship Yp/s = dP/dS, while the volumetric rate for substrate
utilization (Qs) was determined from the maximum slope
in a plot of substrate utilized vs. time of biomass cultivation. Specific rate constants for substrate utilization (qs)
were calculated by the equation i.e., qs = µ × Ys/x. The significance of results has been presented in the form of
probability, using post-hoc multiple ranges under analysis of variance [33].

One enzyme unit
One unit of tyrosinase activity is equal to a ∆A265 nm of
0.001 per min at pH 6.5 at 25°C in a 3.0 ml reaction mixture containing L-catechol and L-ascorbic acid.
