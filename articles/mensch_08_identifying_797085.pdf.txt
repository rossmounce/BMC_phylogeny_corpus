Abstract
Background: Understanding the genetic architecture of ecologically relevant adaptive traits
requires the contribution of developmental and evolutionary biology. The time to reach the age of
reproduction is a complex life history trait commonly known as developmental time. In particular,
in holometabolous insects that occupy ephemeral habitats, like fruit flies, the impact of
developmental time on fitness is further exaggerated. The present work is one of the first
systematic studies of the genetic basis of developmental time, in which we also evaluate the impact
of environmental variation on the expression of the trait.
Results: We analyzed 179 co-isogenic single P[GT1]-element insertion lines of Drosophila
melanogaster to identify novel genes affecting developmental time in flies reared at 25°C. Sixty
percent of the lines showed a heterochronic phenotype, suggesting that a large number of genes
affect this trait. Mutant lines for the genes Merlin and Karl showed the most extreme phenotypes
exhibiting a developmental time reduction and increase, respectively, of over 2 days and 4 days
relative to the control (a co-isogenic P-element insertion free line). In addition, a subset of 42 lines
selected at random from the initial set of 179 lines was screened at 17°C. Interestingly, the geneby-environment interaction accounted for 52% of total phenotypic variance. Plastic reaction norms
were found for a large number of developmental time candidate genes.
Conclusion: We identified components of several integrated time-dependent pathways affecting
egg-to-adult developmental time in Drosophila. At the same time, we also show that many
heterochronic phenotypes may arise from changes in genes involved in several developmental
mechanisms that do not explicitly control the timing of specific events. We also demonstrate that
many developmental time genes have pleiotropic effects on several adult traits and that the action
of most of them is sensitive to temperature during development. Taken together, our results stress
the need to take into account the effect of environmental variation and the dynamics of gene
interactions on the genetic architecture of this complex life-history trait.

Background
Development is a variable and time-dependent process
that can be thought of as mapping genotypes on to adult
phenotypes [1,2]. The time elapsed from the embryo to
the reproductive phase, commonly known as developmental time (DT), is a trait of great relevance to fitness in
all organisms [3]. In particular, Drosophila species occupy
ephemeral habitats, such as rotting fruits that may result
in selection for rapid development. Quoting Gould's
Ontogeny and Phylogeny: "The timing of maturation is a
primary variable in setting life history strategies. We have
a prima facie case for ascribing direct significance to the
change in developmental timing itself, not only to its
morphological consequences"[4]. In addition, changes in
the timing of developmental processes – heterochronymay partly account for many evolutionary changes we
observe because of genetic correlations of DT with other
life-history related traits. Incidentally, heterochrony can
also proceed by truncation in addition to retardation/
acceleration of developmental processes [5]. The genes
that control development are broadly shared among distantly related groups, and some of the pathways are surprisingly similar in superficially different organisms [6,7].
In this sense, experimental studies of egg-to-adult heterochrony at the molecular level can provide insights into the
evolutionary processes by uncovering the genetic basis of
ecologically relevant adaptive traits.
DT is a complex trait that displays considerable genetic
variation in natural populations [8,9]. Laboratory selection for reduced DT triggered a negatively correlated
response of other life-history traits, such as adult weight at
eclosion [10], adult size [10-13], pre-adult survival
[12,13] and longevity [14]. The reduction of adult fitness
as a consequence of the acceleration of DT is a pattern
called fast development syndrome and it illuminates the
direct connection of the pre-adult and adult stages
through energetic trade-offs [14]. These studies highlight
the negative genetic correlations between DT and a large
number of adult life-history traits, suggesting that genes
involved in early development may also have pleiotropic
effects on adult traits. However, specific genes contributing to variation in DT, and its correlations with other lifehistory traits, remain largely unknown.
The analysis of the genetic architecture of a trait requires
not only the identification of the set of genes involved in
its expression, but also their response to environmental
variation (phenotypic plasticity) [15-17]. Phenotypic
plasticity refers to the ability of a genotype to produce
alternative morphological, behavioral and physiological
characteristics in response to environmental conditions
[18-21]. Temperature is an important environmental factor that affects the developing organism and surely has
played a major role during the evolution of developmen-

tal traits in ectotherms [22-24]. Indeed, ectotherms must
adapt their developmental program to a wide range of
environmental temperatures during the day and also in
different seasons along the year.
Drosophila brings an impressive toolkit for dissecting multiple interacting loci with individually small and environmentally sensitive effects that affect complex traits [15]. Pelement mutagenesis is an effective strategy for studying
the effects of single mutations on complex phenotypes
[15]. A comprehensive understanding of DT requires the
knowledge of: (1) the identities of the genes involved in
the expression of the phenotype, (2) the underlying biological processes and molecular pathways, (3) the pleiotropic effects on adult traits and (4) the genetic basis of
phenotypic plasticity in response to environmental variation.
Here we report a study of DT that reveals a large number
of heterochronic mutants, most of which retard the time
to reach the adult stage. The fastest developing line in our
survey is a mutant of Merlin, a gene encoding a protein
that regulates cell proliferation in developing imaginal
discs. Interestingly, Merlin is the homolog of the human
tumor suppressor gene Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NT2)
involved in deregulation of cell proliferation in pathologies of the central nervous system [25]. In addition, we
provide evidence for extensive pleiotropic effects of
growth control genes on adult traits. Finally, we discovered several candidate genes involved in the plastic
response to temperature variation.

Results
Pattern of variation among co-isogenic P[GT1] insertion
lines
Substantial phenotypic variation among lines was
observed for DT (Figure 1), wherein the most commons
effect was an increase of DT relative to the control. This is
not unexpected as the most likely effect of mutations on a
fitness-related trait is reasonable to be deleterious,
although, we found a significant positive correlation (r:
0.3, p < 3 × 105) between DT and viability [see Additional
file 1]. This pattern revealed that the result observed of the
heterochornic effect of the P[GT1] insertion lines can not
be explain as a consequence of unfit flies. The most
extreme phenotypes were exhibited by lines BG01543 and
BG01412. The former developed 60 and 50 hours (males
and females, respectively) faster and the latter 119 and
146 hours (males and females, respectively) slower than
the control. We observed a significant line effect indicating mutational variance among single P-element insertion
lines (Table 1). Indeed, the line effect accounts for 84% of
total variance, five times higher than the error. In the
ANOVA, differences between sexes were also significant,
with males developing faster than females. In addition,

the contribution of the line-by-sex interaction to the total
phenotypic variance was not significant.
Identification of co-isogenic P[GT1] insertion lines
affecting DT and functional analysis
Dunnett analyses revealed that 107 out of 179 lines (60%)
differed significantly from the control. Mean values of all
significant P[GT1] insertion lines tested at 25°C are
shown in Additional file 2. In seventy-four lines (40%)
the insertion of the P-element caused an increase in DT,
while in the rest of the significant lines DT was shortened
as compared to the control (20%) (Figure 1). Those lines
that exhibited significant DT differences relative to the
control (heterochronic mutants) were considered as lines
bearing an insertion in a candidate DT gene. Among fast
developing lines, BG01543 and BG01902 stand out, since
DT was reduced in each by more than 2 days. The P-element in line BG01902 disrupts mastermind (mam), a gene
encoding a glutamine-rich nuclear protein [26] that is a
positive transcriptional regulator of the Notch signaling

pathway [27-30]. Notch is a central element in the cell signaling mechanism that controls a broad spectrum of cell
fate choices during development across metazoans [3133]. Interestingly, in humans, abnormalities in Notch signaling have been linked to a number of diseases, such as
T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia [34] and aortic valve
disease [35]. In line BG01543, the P-element insertion
occurs in Merlin (Mer), a well-known negative regulator
required for cell proliferation in developing imaginal
discs of Drosophila [25]. It is a component of the Hippo signaling pathway, which is essential for the regulation of
organ size during development [36]. Mer might control
tissue growth by regulating endocytosis of membrane
receptors in imaginal epithelia [37]. Interestingly, Mer is
the homolog of the human tumor suppressor gene Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NT2) involved in the de-regulation
of cell proliferation in tumors of central nervous system
pathologies [25,38].
Another gene involved in a cell proliferation pathway
identified in our screen is forkhead box, sub-group O (foxo).
The insertion line BG01573 bearing a P-element in foxo
increased DT by 24 hours in both sexes. foxo is a key regulatory component of the insulin-signaling pathway,
which in Drosophila regulates the control of growth size of
cells, organs, and the entire body in response to nutrient
availability [39]. Puig et al. [40] established that foxo activates transcription in downstream as well as upstream targets of this signaling cascade by a transcriptional feedback
mechanism that regulates cell growth and proliferation. It
has been suggested that the insulin-signaling pathway regulates cell proliferation in imaginal discs, though the
duration of the proliferation phases are controlled by
Juvenile Hormone (JH) and ecdysteroids, that are themselves unaffected by the insulin-signaling pathway [41].
Premature ecdysone release leads to the rapid development of small adults, while the delay in ecdysone release
extends developmental time and produces larger adults
[42]. Recent studies have shown that the activity of the
insulin-signaling pathway in the prothoracic gland modulates ecdysone release and influence both the length and
the rate of larval growth [43-45]. It has been suggested
that the neuropeptide Amnesiac (Amn) participates in regulating ecdysone synthesis in the prothoracic gland of
Drosophila [43]. Interestingly, the P-element insertion
mutant at Amn (line BG02286) also extended DT by more
than two days in both sexes [see Additional file 2]. However, ecdysone can directly inhibit insulin and growth in
the fat body and other peripheral tissues, an event that
triggers metamorphosis. Furthermore, the ecdysone suppression of growth rate is lost in foxo mutants [45], indicating complex cross-talk between the ecdysone and the
insulin signaling pathway during Drosophila development.

Our survey revealed extreme heterochronic mutants, particularly in the direction of increased DT [see Additional
file 2]. For instance, the P-element insertion in the gene
Karl (BG01010) extended DT by more than 100 hours in
both sexes. The molecular function inferred from protein
sequence suggests that Karl is a retinol-binding protein
with no clear association to a biological process. In line
BG00372 we registered a delay of 93 hours and 108 hours
for males and females, respectively. In this case the P-element has inserted 1498 bp downstream of the 3' end of
the CG1678 gene. The molecular function and the biological processes in which this gene is involved are unknown.
However, there is evidence that CG1678 interacts with
other genes such as And, ewg, CG1472, rl, Bsg25D,
CG11275 and msb1l [46]. Line BG01412 exhibited the
most extreme phenotype in our screen, the P-element
insertion was associated with an extended developmental
time of 119 and 146 hours in males and females, respectively. Unfortunately, information about the nucleotide
sequences flanking the P-element insertion site is not
available.
Candidate DT genes are involved in a wide range of biological processes according to their gene-ontology (GO)
terms (Table 2). Interestingly, DT genes not only are
involved in processes associated to organismal development but also to biosynthetic and cellular metabolic processes. We did not find significant differences between
groups of candidate genes accelerating development vs
those that extended development in the distribution
among GO terms, suggesting that similar ontogenetic

pathways may be responsible for both types of heterochronic phenotypes.
Candidate genes for plasticity
Growth and development of ectotherms are determined
in part by their thermal environment [22,23]. In particular, temperature during ontogeny exerts a strong influence
shaping the evolution of larval traits [24,47,48]. In fact,
phenotypic responses result of adaptation to different
thermal environments and/or may be an unavoidable
consequence of the effect of temperature on the organism's physiology during development [49]. In this context, the pattern of phenotypic effects of P-element
insertion lines reared at different developmental temperatures would provide new insights in the study of phenotypic evolution of larval traits. The ANOVA showed that
differences among lines and between thermal treatments
were significant (Table 3). More importantly, our screen
revealed that the line-by-sex and the line-by-temperature
interactions were also highly significant, indicating that
the behavior of each line depended on the temperature at
which it was reared and the sex. However, there was a
large difference in the magnitude of these genotype-byenvironment interactions. The former accounts for only
1% of the total phenotypic variance (a percentage similar
to that obtained in the 25°C assay) while the line-by-temperature interaction explained 52% of the variation.
Moreover, note that in the general assay, the percentage of
total phenotypic variance explained by differences among
lines was 84%, whereas in our assays of phenotypic plasticity this percentage dropped to 30%. It may be argued
that part of the effect was obscured by the high value of
the line-by-temperature interaction term. This observation opens an excellent opportunity for studying the
genetic basis of phenotypic plasticity of developmental
time. Thus, we decided to analyze whether the significant
line-by-temperature interaction can be explained by
changes in magnitude of among-line variance across thermal treatments or changes in the rank order among lines,
i.e. a cross-temperature genetic correlation lower than

unity. Our results showed that about half of the interaction variance can be explained by a greater among-line
variance observed at 17°C than 25°C and the other half
by temperature-specific effects on DT of the lines (Figure
2).
Thirty out of 42 lines tested at 17°C and 25°C showed significant differences relative to the control at one or both
temperatures (Table 4). In addition, DT measured at different temperatures were positive correlated for the set of
30 heterochronic lines in both sexes (males: r: 0.61, p <
0.05; females: r: 0.55, p < 0.05; Figure 3). These results
imply that most of the mutations that affected DT at both
temperatures did so in the same phenotypic direction
(either increasing or decreasing DT). Forty seven percent
of the lines showed this pattern (bottom left and top right
quadrants in Figure 3). Nevertheless, we also identified a
set of lines in which the effect of the mutation on DT was
temperature-dependent, suggesting that the mutated loci
may be possible candidates for temperature plasticity
genes. Indeed, forty percent of the lines affected DT in
only one of the temperatures. We observed three lines
showing a heterochronic phenotype only at 25°C. The
line bearing an insertion in CG14478 is an example of this

pattern. In contrast, nine lines showed a heterochronic
phenotype only at 17°C. For example, the insertion in Imp
exhibited significant differences at 17°C in both sexes, but
not at 25°C. Surprisingly, four lines (13%) affected DT in
opposite phenotypic directions in the two rearing temperatures. On the one hand, line BG02159, bearing a mutation in CG32666, decreased and increased DT at 17°C and
25°C, respectively. On the other hand, mutant lines for
genes Nmdar, sugarless and CG11226 exhibited the opposite pattern (Figure 4).

Discussion
Genetic architecture of developmental time
The genetic architecture of a trait determines the variational properties of the phenotype, that is, its evolutionary
potential. Our study revealed 116 heterochronic independent mutants involved in the expression of DT (107
lines showed a mutant phenotype at 25°C, while 9 lines
were heterochronic only at 17°C). In this sense, we were
capable to identify components of different kind of pathways involved in DT expression. On the one hand, some
components correspond to molecular mechanisms
directly involved in timekeeping processes, such as, the
ecdysone and the insulin-signaling pathway [41,50,51]. It

has been established that environmental inputs during
ontogeny influences multiple steps of the these kind of
heterochronic gene pathways, such as, the nutrition status
and the light: dark regimes. A paradigmatic example of
this kind of environmental input is the circadian rhythm
period mutants that alter DT in Drosophila [52]. On the
other hand, we also observed heterochronic phenotypes
that seem to be a by-product of the disruption of a pathway that is not explicitly involved in the control of temporal process but plays a major role in organ growth This is
the case of Merlin, a negative regulator of the Hippo signaling pathway, required for cell proliferation in developing
imaginal discs. Interestingly, Merlin is a component of a
tumour-suppressor network associated with human tumorigenesis [36]. All in all, our results support the hypothesis raised by Moss [53] that timing of development is
control directly and indirectly by different ontogenetic
pathways.
Since the same co-isogenic lines were also screened for
abdominal and sternopleural bristle number, starvation

resistance and olfactory behavior [17,54,55] we also
examined whether DT candidate genes have pleiotropic
effects on adult fitness-related traits. Several DT heterochronic lines (genes) affect starvation resistance (4 genes),
bristle number (8 genes) and olfactory behavior (13
genes) [see Additional file 3]. Once again, Merlin seems to
plays a role not only in egg-to-adult DT but also in starvation resistance and adult olfactory behavior. In BG01543
(Mer mutant), the P[GT1] insertion in exon 1 caused a
reduction in the RNA expression levels in embryos, third
instar larvae and adults but not in the pupal stage compared to the control [17] indicating that anomalies caused
by the disruption of Merlin on DT took place before metamorphosis. Since insects do not grow as adults, their
final size is a product of growth rate and length at larval
stages [56]. Surprisingly, the mutated Merlin line did not
differ significantly from the control in several morphological traits such as face width, head width, thorax length
and wing size suggesting a decoupled mechanism of timing control and size development (Carreira, Mensch &
Fanara, unpublished results). Regarding the pleiotropic

effect of Mer on starvation resistance and adult olfactory
behavior, it is not easy to discern whether aberrant phenotypes are the consequence of early developmental events
or are directly related to the functional disruption of the
gene product in the adult. As another example, the insertion line for tramtrack (ttk), a transcription repressor gene
involved in cell-fate determination [57], increased DT by
two days in both sexes and also affected starvation resistance and olfactory behavior. These interesting examples
constitute clear evidence of an intricate network of pleiotropic effects of key developmental genes throughout the
life-cycle of a holometabolous organism. Such pervasive
pleiotropy of key genes that control development, affecting early and late fitness-related traits, show an integrated
picture of the evolution of life-history traits at the molecular level.
Regarding the effect of sex, males developed significantly
faster than females, an observation that is quite striking
since it is at odds with extensive literature showing that
Drosophila females usually reach adulthood before males
in the species studied so far [58]. Moreover, a recent study
by Paranjpe et al. [59] showed that females developed
faster than males in D. melanogaster. However, some differences between our study and Paranjpe et al.'s in terms
of the experimental design are worth mentioning. Paranjpe et al. found that females developed faster than males
under several photoperiod regimes during ontogeny,

including 12:12 L:D (the regime performed in our study).
Nevertheless, we must note that different genetic backgrounds were analyzed in these two studies. Indeed, our
control line, which shares the same genetic background
with all mutant lines tested, did not show any sign of sexual dimorphism in DT, stressing the need to take into
account the effect of the genetic background on the
expression of the analyzed trait since genetic background
× gene interactions are known to be quite pervasive
[60,61]. At the same time the null input of the line-by-sex
interaction to the total phenotypic variance adds a complementary aspect to the discussion of the absence of sexual dimorphism for DT. In the last few years a similar set
of coisogenic insertion lines was studied for several adult
traits for which the line-by-sex interaction explained significant portions of variance. In this context, our DT survey yielded the lowest value in this category, followed by
sternopleural bristle number (5%), adult odor-behavior
(13%), abdominal bristle number (21%) and starvation
resistance (66%) [17,54,55]. Among the heterochronic
mutants, nine had a male-specific effect and in seven only
female DT was affected. It is important to note that none
of the lines showed opposite phenotypic effects across
sexes, meaning that we did not find any lines that
decreased DT in one sex and increased the trait in the
other. In conclusion, our results indicate that there are features of the genetic architecture of DT that are highly conserved in both sexes.

Gene-by-environment interaction
Although the multiple interacting genes affecting complex
traits can readily be dissected, how much genotype-environment interactions contribute to variation in these traits
remains elusive. The quantitative dissection of developmental time reported here reveals that almost all heterochronic lines tested at different developmental
temperature presented an effect with quantitative variation between temperatures, a remarkable consequence of
the large gene-by-environment interaction (Table 4). The
most striking examples of these developmental reaction
norms are the mutant lines for genes CG11226, CG32666,
Nmdar1, and sugarless (Figure 4). CG32666 gene product
is a receptor signaling protein with serine/threonine
kinase activity, NMDAR1 is a ionotropic glutamate receptor and SUGARLESS is a protein with UDP-glucose 6dehrygenase activity indicating that this routine cellular
metabolic processes are not only involved in developmental time but also that are sensitive to environmental variation.

The part of the genetic diversity that has the potential to
affect the phenotype, but that is not expressed under the
current genotypic or environmental conditions, is referred
to as "cryptic" or "hidden" genetic variation [62]. Molecular mechanisms responsible for this particular genetic variation include epistasis and genotype-by-environment
interactions. In our case, in addition to the plastic developmental reaction norms, large input to the gene-by-environment interaction refers to the bigger variance
magnitude at 17°C (Figure 2). It is possible that at 25°C
genetic variation was buffered in comparison to the variation expressed at 17°C, an unusual rearing temperature
for these lines. Taken together, our results highlight the
large potential of the Drosophila genome to changes in this
relevant environmental factor, although this genetic plasticity was exhibited by these particular inbred lines, a pattern that it is not necessarily true for outbred populations.
Future efforts will focus on elucidating the molecular
mechanisms controlling the temperature plastic response
observed. Since in nature insects are exposed to a wide
range of environmental temperatures during the day and
also in different seasons along the year with local-specific

thermal regimes, we are also interested in studying the
evolutionary forces shaping the variation in the candidate
DT genes.

Conclusion
The study of heterochrony has played an important role in
the intersection of evolution, genetics and developmental
biology since the late nineteenth century. During the last
decade the concept has been revitalized with studies at cellular and molecular level. Here we identified components
of several integrated time-dependent pathways affecting
egg-to-adult DT and also components of pathways that
are not explicitly involved in the control of temporal processes. In this sense, we identified 116 egg-to-adult heterochronic mutants, most of them developed slower
compared to the control. However, we identified a set of
lines that developed faster by more than two days. This is
the case of Mer mutant line, a gene involved in a cell proliferation pathway. Mer and others DT candidate genes
have pleitropic effects on adult traits as well. Most of
developmental time candidate genes were sensitive to the
rearing temperature, a fact that stresses the need to take
into account the effect of environmental variation on the
genetic architecture of complex traits.

Methods
Drosophila stocks and Developmental time assays
We scored 179 homozygous viable P[GT1] insertion lines,
contructed in a co-isogenic Canton-S B background [63] as
part of the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (see Availability and requirements section for URL) for DT.

Batches of 30–40 P-element insertion lines were assessed
simultaneously. To account for environmental variation
in DT between batches, 8 replicated vials of the control
strain (a co-isogenic P-element insertion free line with the
same genetic background) was run in parallel with each
batch. For each line, 300 pairs of sexually mature flies
were placed in oviposition chambers for 8 hours. Eggs
were allowed to hatch and batches of 30 first-instar larvae
were transferred to culture vials containing a cornmealagar-molasses medium (4 replicates vial per line).
Emerged flies from each vial were collected every 12 hours
and sorted by sex. We estimated DT as the time elapsed
since the transfer of first-instar larvae to the vials until
adult emergence. Each vial was kept in an incubator at
25°C ± 0.5, under a 12:12 h light:dark photoperiod and
at 60–70% of humidity. Thirteen lines with low viability
(those that reached less than 50% of control pre-adult survival) were excluded from our survey to avoid the confusing effect of high pre-adult mortality with DT. A subset of
42 lines selected at random was also screened at 17 ±
0.5°C.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/8/78

Statistical analysis
Quantitative genetic analysis
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was utilized to assess the
magnitude of mutational variance for DT at each temperature. In order to include all lines tested in different
batches, individual DT scores were expressed as deviations
from the mean of their contemporaneous co-isogenic
controls, separately for males and females. Three-way
ANOVA was computed for each thermal treatment, following the mixed model: Y = μ + L + S + L × S + E, where
μ is the overall mean, L is the random effect of line, S is
the fixed effect of sex and E represents the error term. An
ANOVA was used to assess the magnitude of mutational
variance for DT induced by P[GT1] insertions. We also
estimated the relative contribution of all random sources
of variation (Line, Line × Sex, and error) to the total variance.

To identify which lines were responsible of the significant
line or line-by-sex interaction, phenotypic differences
between P-element insertion lines and the control were
tested using Dunnett contrasts for each temperature and
batch. Those lines that exhibited significant DT differences relative to the control (heterochronic mutants) were
considered as lines bearing an insertion in a candidate DT
gene.
Gene-by-thermal treatment analysis
In those lines screened at both temperatures (17 and
25°C) we studied the effect of phenotypic plasticity by
thermal treatments following the mixed ANOVA model, Y
= μ + L + S + T + L × S + L × T + S × T + L × S × T + E, where
μ is the overall mean, L is the random effect of line, S is
the fixed effect of sex, T is the fixed effect of thermal treatment and E represents the error term. Since significant G
× E (genotype × environment) can arise due to: (1) differences among- lines variance in separate environments
(change in scale) and/or (2) deviations from unity of the
cross-environment genetic correlation (rG × E < 1, see
below) (changes in rank order), the contribution of these
two sources of variation was analyzed by means of the
equation derived by Robertson [64], VG × E = [(σE1 - σE2)2 +
2σE1σE2(1 - rG × E)]/2, where VG × E is the G × E variance
component, rG × E is the cross-environment genetic correlation and, σE1 and σE2 are the square roots of the
among-line variance components of the two thermal environments studied [65]. The first term corresponds to differences in among-line variance while the second
corresponds to deviations from the perfect correlation
across environments (rG × E < 1). The cross-environment
genetic correlation (rG × E < 1) is the genetic correlation
of measurements in different environments and here
reflects the degree in which the same genes control the
expression across environments. rG × E was estimated as:
rG × E = COVE1E2/σE1 σE2, where COVE1E2 is the covariance

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/8/78

of lines in different environments and it was calculated as
the covariance of the lines in different environments.
Finally, we studied the phenotypic change by the effect of
the P element insertion in each line showing significant
differences with respect to the control in at least one thermal assay. In this case we used the following fixed ANOVA
model:
Y = μ + T + S + T × S + E, where T stands for the effect of
thermal treatment, S for the effect of sex and E represents
the error term. Those lines that exhibited significant differences in DT between thermal treatments (T factor) were
considered as lines bearing a mutation in a candidate gene
involved in the plastic response of DT to temperature variation.

All statistical analyses were performed using STATISTICA
software packages (StatSoft, Inc. 1999, 2001).
Gene identification and functional analysis
In order to identify the mutated genes, nucleotide
sequences flanking the P-element insertion in each candidate line were used to search for homologous regions in
the D. melanogaster genome. Searches of homologous
sequences were performed against Release 5 of the published D. melanogaster genomic sequence using the
Pubmed server. Flybase (see Availability and requirements section for URL) was used to identify target genes.
Candidate DT genes were distributed in different biological processes according to their gene-ontology (GO) terms
[66]. This analysis was performed automatically with the
aid of the program FatiGO+, from the Babelomics suite of
bioinformatic tools, available at (see Availability and
requirements section for URL)[67]. This program distributes the genes among the GO terms in a non-exclusive
manner (i.e. a given gene might be associated to more
than one GO term). Using the same program we made a
comparison of the distribution of GO terms between the
sample of lines that developed faster and the population
of lines that developed longer in order to find GO terms
that were significantly over-represented in one of the samples.
