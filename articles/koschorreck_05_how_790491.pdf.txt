Abstract
Background: In screening of libraries derived by expression cloning, expression of active proteins
in E. coli can be limited by formation of inclusion bodies. In these cases it would be desirable to
enrich gene libraries for coding sequences with soluble gene products in E. coli and thus to improve
the efficiency of screening. Previously Wilkinson and Harrison showed that solubility can be
predicted from amino acid composition (Biotechnology 1991, 9(5):443–448). We have applied this
analysis to members of the alpha/beta hydrolase fold family to predict their solubility in E. coli. alpha/
beta hydrolases are a highly diverse family with more than 1800 proteins which have been grouped
into homologous families and superfamilies.
Results: The predicted solubility in E. coli depends on hydrolase size, phylogenetic origin of the
host organism, the homologous family and the superfamily, to which the hydrolase belongs. In
general small hydrolases are predicted to be more soluble than large hydrolases, and eukaryotic
hydrolases are predicted to be less soluble in E. coli than prokaryotic ones. However, combining
phylogenetic origin and size leads to more complex conclusions. Hydrolases from prokaryotic,
fungal and metazoan origin are predicted to be most soluble if they are of small, medium and large
size, respectively. We observed large variations of predicted solubility between hydrolases from
different homologous families and from different taxa.
Conclusion: A comprehensive analysis of all alpha/beta hydrolase sequences allows more efficient
screenings for new soluble alpha/beta hydrolases by the use of libraries which contain more soluble
gene products. Screening of hydrolases from families whose members are hard to express as
soluble proteins in E. coli should first be done in coding sequences of organisms from phylogenetic
groups with the highest average of predicted solubility for proteins of this family. The tools
developed here can be used to identify attractive target genes for expression using protein
sequences published in databases. This analysis also directs the design of degenerate, family- specific
primers to amplify new members from homologous families or superfamilies with a high probability
of soluble alpha/beta hydrolases.

Background
It was observed that screening of libraries derived by
expression cloning for new gene products with a given catalytic activity can be limited by formation of inclusion
bodies. In these cases it would be desirable to construct
libraries which a higher fraction of soluble gene products.
Enrichment of soluble proteins could be achieved either
by limiting the screening to coding sequences from phylogenetic groups with mainly soluble proteins or by the
use of degenerated primers which are specific for homologous families with mainly soluble proteins.
Alternatively solubility can be improved by the use of
fusion proteins [2] like NusA, MBP, Thioredoxin, GrpE,
BFR, GST, DsbA [3], the N- terminal domain of IF2 [4] or
phage coat protein III [5]. In addition fusion proteins
allow affinity chromatography and thus simplify purification [6]. However in some cases the fusion partner has to
be removed after protein purification [7] and therefore
constitutes and additional step in protein preparation.
Other strategies try to improve in vivo solubility of a
recombinant protein by protein engineering using strategies like molecular evolution [8,9] or rational protein
design. Examples for protein design are the insertion of
positively charged residues into hydrophobic patches on
the surface [10], exchange of phenylalanines by serines
[11] or asparagine residues by aspartic acids [12]. It has
been shown that single residues can have a major impact
on solubility [13-16]. But also the expression system is
important for in vivo solubility [2,17]. Other factors are
cultivation and disruption conditions [18-20], rate of protein synthesis [21], fermentation temperature [20,22] and
the amount of helper protein [12,23-26]. Fusion proteins
have already been successfully used in high throughput
expression- studies to improve solubility [8,27-30].
However, engineering approaches are limited to specific
proteins or growth conditions and are hardly applicable
to high throughput expression. Therefore, in projects
where libraries are screened for activity, solubility is
always an implicit criterion. Previously Harrison et al.
introduced a two-parameter model based on an analysis
of 81 proteins for which experimental data on solubility
exists [1,3]. The model proposes that solubility of proteins
in E. coli at physiological conditions depends mainly on
protein charge and the relative number of turn-forming
residues. Interestingly, the model holds for a broad variety
of proteins.
We applied this model to a comprehensive analysis of the
Lipase Engineering Database (LED) [31,32] which
includes more than 1800 α/β-hydrolases. α/β-hydrolases
share the same fold but are highly diverse in sequence.
They are ubiquitous and include cellular and secreted proteins from a wide range of organisms.

The aim of this study was to find correlations between predicted solubility in E. coli and protein size or phylogenetic
origin. Homologous families and superfamilies were analysed for the predicted solubility of their members.

Results
Kingdoms of life
According to Harrison et al. [1,3] the canonical variable
CV-CV' predicts from the protein sequence whether a
recombinantly expressed protein is soluble in the cytoplasm of E. coli (CV-CV' < 0) or will form inclusion bodies
(CV-CV' > 0). For CV-CV' = 0 the probability of solubility
is 0.5. The probability of solubility or insolubility rises for
higher absolutes of CV-CV'. An analysis of the Lipase Engineering Database indicates that most of the hydrolases are
predicted to be insoluble in E. coli, with a major peak at
CV-CV' = 0.8 and a minor peak at CV-CV' = 0.2 (Figure 1).
A separate analysis of hydrolases from eukaryotic and
prokaryotic origin (679 and 686 hydrolases, respectively)
demonstrates that these two peaks are formed predominantly by the hydrolases from each of the two kingdoms
of life. The distribution of CV-CV' of bacterial hydrolases
is characterized by an average of 0.42 and a first quartile
of -0.18. Because the first quartile indicates the minimum
solubility of the 25 % most soluble hydrolases, more than
25 % of all bacterial hydrolases are predicted to be soluble. In contrast, for eukaryotic hydrolases the average of
CV-CV' is 0.94; the first quartile is 0.58. Thus, only a small
fraction of eukaryotic hydrolases is predicted to be soluble
in E. coli. α/β-hydrolases from archaea were not investigated because they are only represented with 23
hydrolases.

Thus, in general, bacterial α/β-hydrolases are predicted to
be more soluble in E. coli than eukaryotic α/β-hydrolases.
Protein size
The family of α/β-hydrolases falls into three major groups
of protein size: small (150–380 amino acids), mediumsized (380–520 amino acids) and large hydrolases (more
than 520 amino acids) (Figure 2). Large hydrolases are
mainly from eukaryotic origin while small hydrolases are
mainly from bacterial origin. Correlating sequence length
and predicted solubility in E. coli demonstrates that large
hydrolases are predicted to be less soluble in E. coli than
smaller ones (Figure 3). Hydrolases predicted to be soluble in E. coli (CV-CV' < 0) have sequence lengths between
200 and 400 amino acids, most hydrolases of more than
400 amino acids are predicted to be insoluble in E. coli
(CV-CV' > 0). A high fraction of bacterial and archaean
small hydrolases is predicted to be soluble in E. coli, while
eukaryotic small hydrolases are predicted to be mainly
insoluble. The two outliers with CV-CV' < -1 and a
sequence length larger than 650 are a lipase from Staphylococcus xylosus (AAG35726) and CG6296 from Drosophila

melanogaster (AAF56648). Both are putative proteins and
have not yet been expressed in E. coli. Thus, there are two
general observations: (1) small α/β-hydrolases are predicted to be more soluble in E. coli than large α/β-hydrolases and (2) eukaryotic α/β-hydrolases are larger than
prokaryotic α/β-hydrolases.
Analysis of groups formed by protein size
To distinguish the effects of hydrolase size and phylogenetic origin on solubility, small, medium- sized and large
α/β-hydrolases were investigated separately, and hydrolases were grouped by phylogeny of their origin (Tables 1,
2, 3).

Small hydrolases have an average of CV-CV' of 0.48 and a
first quartile of -0.17, thus more than 25 % of small
hydrolases are predicted to be soluble in E. coli. All taxa
have a positive average of CV-CV' (Table 1), indicating
that less than 50 % of the hydrolases in each taxon are pre-

dicted to be soluble. Hydrolases from eukaryotic taxa are
at average predicted to be highly insoluble. All prokaryotic
taxa and plants have negative first quartiles of CV-CV',
thus more than 25 % of their hydrolases are predicted to
be soluble. All other eukaryotic taxa have positive first
quartiles of CV-CV', thus most of their hydrolases are predicted to be insoluble. The taxa containing hydrolases
with the highest predicted solubility average are from bacteria, the taxa containing hydrolases with the lowest predicted solubility average are from eukaryota.
Medium- sized hydrolases have an average of CV-CV' of
0.98 and a first quartile of 0.54. Hydrolases of all taxa
have a positive average of CV-CV', and thus are mainly
predicted to be insoluble (Table 2). Only actinobacteria
have a negative first quartile of CV-CV', indicating that
more than 25 % of its hydrolases are predicted to be
soluble, all other taxa have positive first quartiles of CVCV'. The taxa containing hydrolases with the highest

predicted solubility average are from bacteria and fungi.
The taxa containing hydrolases with the lowest predicted
solubility average are from metazoa and plants.
Large hydrolases have an average of CV-CV' of 0.93 and a
first quartile of 0.61, they are in general predicted to be
highly insoluble. All taxa have positive averages and first
quartiles of CV-CV', and thus most of their hydrolases are
predicted to be insoluble (Table 3). The taxa containing
hydrolases with the highest predicted solubility average
are from metazoa, the taxa containing hydrolases with the
lowest predicted solubility average are from bacteria and
fungi.
In general CV-CV' from bacterial hydrolases is much lower
if the hydrolase is small, while metazoan hydrolases have
a lower average and first quartile of CV-CV' if the hydrolase is large. Though large metazoan hydrolases have a

higher probability of solubility than small metazoan
hydrolases, few large hydrolases are predicted to be soluble in E. coli (Figure 3). This is consistent with the result
from Table 3 that in the analysis of large hydrolases no
taxon with a negative first quartile of CV-CV' could be
found.
Thus there are several conclusions. Large α/β-hydrolases
from bacteria are predicted to be less soluble than smaller
ones. Small bacterial α/β-hydrolases are predicted to be
more soluble than both small and large eukaryotic α/βhydrolases. But large hydrolases from metazoa are predicted to be more soluble than large hydrolases from bacteria and small hydrolases from metazoa. So there seems
to be a principal difference between metazoa and bacteria.
Fungi, especially ascomycetes, behave differently. Their α/
β-hydrolases with the highest predicted solubility are
mainly medium- sized.

Analysis of solubility by genera
Of the 257 genera represented in the database most
include only a few hydrolases. Therefore the 29 genera
with at least ten hydrolases were analyzed (Table A in the
supplementary file 1). Most hydrolases of all eukaryotic
taxa with the exception of Oryza are predicted to be highly
insoluble in E. coli.

Hydrolases from bacterial genera show a wide range of
averages of predicted solubility. Interestingly the bacterial
genera with the highest and the lowest average of CV-CV'
(Mycobacterium and Rhodococcus) are both from actinobacteria. The third large genus of actinobacteria, Streptomyces,
is predicted to include more than 25 % soluble hydrolases
as it is shown by a negative first quartile.

Thus the averages of different genera of a taxon may differ
completely in predicted solubility. Therefore a strategy to
identify α/β-hydrolases from actinobacteria that are soluble in E. coli should focus on proteins from Rhodococcus
and Streptomyces, but not from Mycobacterium.
Analysis of solubility by sequence similarity
Hydrolases with sequence similarity have been assigned
to superfamilies which were analysed (Table B in the supplementary file 1). Superfamilies with mostly hydrolases
of high predicted solubility contain mainly intracellular
α/β-hydrolases from bacteria (supplementary file 2). The
averages of CV-CV' of the superfamilies that contain
almost exclusively bacterial hydrolases range from -0.77
to 0.36. Metazoan, fungal and secreted hydrolases can
mainly be found in superfamilies with averages of CV-CV'
between 0.38 (hormone sensitive lipases) and 1.45 (cuti-

nases) (supplementary file 2). In general, the average of
CV-CV' depends on sequence length. However, the superfamily with the lowest sequence length in this table (Table
B in the supplementary file 1), Bacillus lipase, has the lowest predicted solubility.
Proteins from cytosolic hydrolases, a large superfamily
that contains mainly epoxide hydrolases and haloalkane
dehalogenases, are in general predicted to be more soluble than proteins from most other superfamilies. The average of CV-CV' is 0.29 and the first quartile is -0.22. This
superfamily was chosen for a more detailed analysis of
homologous families (Table C in the supplementary file
1). The CV-CV' averaged over hydrolases of each homolo-

gous family of this superfamily ranges from -0.29 to 0.86.
This shows that there can be the prediction of families
with mostly soluble and of families with mostly insoluble
proteins in one superfamily. This observation is analogous to the previous observation with genera and higher
taxa. As expected the homologous families with the highest predicted solubility average are dominated by bacterial
hydrolases and the families with proteins of low predicted
solubility rather contain eukaryotic hydrolases (supplementary file 2). The homologous family with the highest
predicted solubility average, which is dominated by
eukaryots, is the 'soluble plant epoxide hydrolases'.
Almost 50 % of its members are predicted to be soluble in
E. coli.

Thus the averages of different homologous families of a
superfamily may differ significantly in predicted
solubility.

Discussion
The solubility model
The dataset of the statistical solubility model were 81
highly diverse proteins, for which solubility data exists,
from a wide range of organisms [1]. The published prediction accuracy of the five parameter model was 76 % for
soluble proteins and 91 % for insoluble proteins [1], the
overall accuracy for solubility prediction of proteins from
the dataset was 88% [1]. It has been discovered that only
two out of the five parameters are critical for distinguishing between soluble and insoluble proteins [3]. Therefore,
CV-CV', the indicator of predicted solubility, was derived
by two terms: the total charge calculated by the relative
numbers of arginines, lysines, aspartic acids and glutamic
acids, and the relative number of turn forming residues
calculated by the relative number of asparagines, glycines,
prolines and serines. Those two parameters show a level of
significance of 100% [1].

Most of the variation of CV-CV' among α/β-hydrolases is
caused by the charge term. A high negative or positive
charge results in the best predicted solubility. However,
the pK value of a titratable group is highly dependent on
the proteins structure. Short- and long-range interactions
can lead to pK shifts of more than two units, changing the
total protein charge by more than five unit charges
[33,34].
An evaluation of nine frequently used fusion proteins
used to improve solubility in E. coli [3-5] showed that
seven proteins indeed are predicted to be soluble in E. coli
(data not shown). The exceptions are MBP which has a

CV-CV' of 0.23, and phage coat protein III which has a CVCV' of 0.62 (data not shown).
To test the model in the prediction of solubility of hydrolases, 35 hydrolases from the PDB which were annotated
as expressed in E. coli were examined (Table D in the supplementary file 1). Because good solubility is prerequisite
for successful crystallization, this group of proteins served
as a positive control for the predictive value of our
method. 24 of 35 hydrolases are predicted to be soluble in
E. coli (CV-CV' < 0). For all 35 hydrolases, the average of
CV-CV' is -0.23, the first quartile is -0.80. Thus, the predicted average solubility of this group of proteins is much
higher than any single protein family in the database,
including proteins from enterobacteria and the genus
Escherichia which have an average of CV-CV' of 0.24 and
0.10 respectively (data not shown), which is a strong support for the reliability of this method.
In addition, the observation that substitution of asparagines by aspartic acids in DsbA-IGFBP-3 fusion proteins
improved solubility [12] is consistent with the solubility
formula because the fusion protein is already predicted to
be negatively charged (data not shown). Thus, increasing
the negative charge increases predicted solubility. Similarly, incorporation of solvent exposed positive charged
amino acids improved solubility of consensus ankyrin
repeat proteins [10]. Here the net charge proposed by the
solubility formula was zero (data not shown), so solubility is predicted to be increased by insertion of positively or
negatively charged amino acids.
However, the solubility formula exclusively depends on
sequence information and neglects the structural context.
Therefore, in some cases this simple model resulted in
wrong predictions. In the model, substitution of multiple
phenylalanine residues by serine [11] led to a predicted

increase of the ratio of turn-forming residues in the formula and thus to a lowered predicted solubility in E. coli.
Instead, an increase in solubility was observed experimentally [11] which can be explained by the structural context:
replacement of solvent- accessible phenylalanines
increased polarity of the proteins surface and thus its solubility. The fact that single residues can have a huge
impact on in vivo solubility [13-16] is not always fully
explainable by the solubility formula. Therefore, for the
design of proteins with higher solubility the formula
should be combined with a careful investigation of the
structural context.
Solubility of α/β-hydrolases
Protein size was not included as a parameter in the solubility model, because it showed no significant difference
between soluble and insoluble proteins of the dataset [1].
However, the analysis of groups formed by α/β-hydrolase
size revealed that both protein size and phylogeny of
organisms have a major impact on predicted solubility.
Statements like 'Small hydrolases are predicted to be more
soluble than large hydrolases', 'Bacterial hydrolases are
predicted to be more soluble than eukaryotic hydrolases'
are generally true, but simplifications.

For small to medium- sized hydrolases, bacterial hydrolases are predicted to be more soluble than eukaryotic
hydrolases, archaea are somewhere in between. The relatively high predicted solubility of medium- sized fungal
hydrolases is in contrast to the low predicted solubility of
small and large fungal hydrolases. Hydrolases from plants
are predicted to be much more soluble when they are
small than when they are of medium size. However, the
significance of this statement is relatively low because
there are only eight medium- sized hydrolases from
plants.
Though large hydrolases are mainly predicted to be insoluble the CV-CV' values are much lower for metazoan than
for bacterial and fungal hydrolases. So here the situation
is opposite to the situation of small and medium- sized
hydrolases. Additionally, large metazoan hydrolases are
predicted to be more soluble in E. coli than small and
medium- sized metazoan hydrolases.
These results propose that, in problematic cases where soluble hydrolases are very rare, it makes sense to screen for
large hydrolases in coding sequences of metazoa, small
hydrolases should be searched in bacterial or archaean
and medium- sized hydrolases in actinobacterial or ascomycetic coding sequences. Secreted and eukaryotic hydrolases generally have a low predicted solubility in E. coli.
As the data about taxa, the family information could be
used to efficiently search for new soluble hydrolases. If a

specific catalytic activity is observed in different homologous families or a soluble member of a specific superfamily is searched for a structural genomics project, family
specific degenerate primers could preferably be designed
for families which are predicted to include mainly soluble
hydrolases.
If soluble hydrolases of a given size are rarely found,
screening of libraries could be limited to coding
sequences from taxa where soluble hydrolases are
expected.

Conclusion
General rules for the relationship between predicted solubility in E. coli, protein size and phylogenetic origin are:
1) Bacterial hydrolases are predicted to be more soluble in
E. coli than eukaryotic hydrolases.
2) Small hydrolases are predicted to be more soluble in E.
coli than large hydrolases.
3) In one taxon huge differences of predicted solubility
between genera can exist.
4) In one superfamily huge differences of predicted solubility between homologous families can exist.
When taking into account the groups formed by protein
size there are three additional rules:
5) Small bacterial hydrolases are predicted to be more soluble than small and large hydrolases from eukaryotes and
large bacterial hydrolases.
6) Large metazoan hydrolases are predicted to be more
soluble than large hydrolases from bacteria and small
hydrolases from metazoa.
7) Fungal medium- sized hydrolases are predicted to be
more soluble than small or large hydrolases from fungi.
When using the family characteristics family- specific
primers could be designed to amplify members from specific homologous families with high averages of predicted
solubility in E. coli.

Methods
The database
Sequence data for analysis was derived from the Lipase
Engineering Database (LED) [31,32] which integrates
sequence, structure and annotation information of α/βhydrolases. The database comprises 1820 hydrolases
which are grouped into 149 homologous families and 45
superfamilies.

To remove fragments, only hydrolases larger than 170
amino acids were included in the analysis.
The solubility model
A two parameter statistical model by Harrison et al. [1,3]
was used to predict in vivo solubility of recombinant proteins in E. coli. The main parameters for solubility in E. coli
are the relative number of turn forming residues (asparagine, glycine, proline and serine) and the absolute of
charge per residue which is determined by the fraction of
positively and negatively charged amino acids (arginine,
lysine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid). These values have
been combined to a canonical variable CV, where N, G, P,
S, R, K, D, E, are the numbers of asparagines, glycines, prolines, serines, arginines, lysines, aspartic acids and
glutamic acids, respectively, and n is the total number of
residues in the sequence.

To distinguish soluble from insoluble protein a threshold
of CV' = 1.71 was introduced. If the difference CV-CV' is
smaller than zero, the protein is predicted to be soluble in
E. coli. If it is larger than zero the protein is predicted to be
insoluble in E. coli. From CV-CV' a probability of solubility is calculated:
P = 0.4934 + 0.276|CV - CV'| - 0.0392(CV - CV')2
The higher the absolute of CV-CV', the higher the probability of solubility (CV-CV' < 0) or insolubility (CV-CV' >
0). CV-CV' values of -0.4, 0.0 and 1.1 indicate probabilities of solubility of 60 %, 50 % and 25 %, respectively.
The dependency of solubility on the parameters relative
number of turn forming residues and absolute of charge
per residue can be interpreted as follows: the higher the
charge, the higher the repulsion between proteins, thus
preventing aggregation. Additionally, many turn-forming
residues slow down protein folding, resulting in a high
concentration of folding intermediates which can form
aggregates.
Statistical methods
Averages of CV-CV', the relative number of turn forming
residues, charge per residue and length of protein
sequence were computed. Additionally first quartiles of
CV-CV' were determined. For determination of first quartiles the values were ordered by size and divided into four
groups with the same number of members. The first quartile is the largest value of CV-CV' of the group which
contains 25 % of the smallest values of CV-CV'. This
means that 25 % of all proteins in the distribution are predicted to have at least the solubility that is represented by

the value of the first quartile. When used in combination
with averages, quartiles give additional information about
the shape of the distribution. They make it possible to
compare distributions even if their averages are very similar. While the average value of CV-CV' gives an upper limit
of solubility to 50 % of all proteins of a distribution, the
first quartile indicates the solubility of the 25 % best soluble proteins.
Visualisation of distributions
The optimal window size for the visualisation of the distributions d1, d2 and d3 (Figures 1 and 2) was determined
as follows. For each distribution a window size w was
determined, where max and min are the largest and the
smallest values of the distribution and n is the number of
values in the distribution.

w=

max − min
0.9 ∗ n − 1

As an overall window size for the graphics the largest of
the three window sizes was taken.
