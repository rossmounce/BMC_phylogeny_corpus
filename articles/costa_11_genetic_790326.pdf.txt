Background and objectives
Cork oak (Quercus suber L.) is one of the dominant
broadleaved woody species in the western Mediterranean Basin, defining unique open woods. These woodlands have an outstanding economical and ecological
value in this region, particularly in Portugal, where they
sustain a strong cork industry. In the context of a prospective management of these sustainable ecosystems
and renowned reservoirs of biodiversity, it is vital to better understand how the genetic variation of Q. suber
natural populations is spatially organized so reasonable
guidelines for conservation can be provided. On the
other hand, knowledge of how past climate fluctuations
influenced the patterns and dynamics of Q. suber, shaping the ranges of the species in the Mediterranean
peninsulas, is of the utmost importance for our perception of what can happen in the future. Although a great
deal of details on the genetic divergence of the Mediterranean cork oak populations has been uncovered and
several hypotheses have been advanced concerning its
evolutionary history, there is still much to unravel. For
instance, Portuguese natural population sampling
included so far in previous studies has been very deficient. To achieve this goal a different and complementary analysis of cork oakÂ´s genetic diversity was
initiated under a phylogeographical framework based on
chloroplastidial DNA sequences. This study is the starting up of a project aiming at assessing the genetic diversity and differentiation of natural cork oak populations
from the entire Mediterranean distribution, with the
intent of understanding patterns of biodiversity, gene

flow and population admixture, as well as to infer possible evolutionary events.

Materials and methods
We used 3-5 samples from 25 populations collected
across the range of distribution of cork oak, in a total of
115 individuals. Three chloroplastidial DNA (cpDNA)
intergenic spacer regions (TrnL-F[1], TrnS-PsbC[2] and
TrnH-psbA[3]) were amplified and sequenced. Fourteen
individuals of Q. rotundifolia, five of Q. coccifera, two of
Q. ilex, and one of Q. robur, Q. faginea, Q. pyrenaica,
Q. lusitanicus, Q. rubra and Q. canariensis were also
analyzed as comparative references. Castanea crenata
was used as outgroup. The alignment was developed in
Clustal X 2.0.12 [4] and manually refined. The phylogenetic trees were made with PAUP 4.0d99 [5], using a
Maximum Parsimony analysis method.
Results
Regarding the cpDNA regions under study, two main
lineages of cork oak haplotypes were found: one lineage
closely related to Quercus rotundifolia and Q.coccifera,
(“introgressed lineage”), mainly present in Iberia and
Morocco; and a second lineage that contrastingly seems
“pure”, which is the most common and does not appear
to be shared with any other Quercus species (“pure lineage”). Three distinct sublineages are shown in the
“pure” lineage, corresponding to the Eastern populations, Sicilly and the Western populations, although
separated by minor differences. Some populations present cpDNA haplotypes belonging to both lineages,
while others are specific for one of them. An absence of
introgression in the easternmost populations of cork oak
seems also apparent.

Conclusions
Although these preliminary results seem to confirm previous ones, some major differences are suggested, such
as too few differences between the western and eastern
groups to be explained by a Tertiary divergence pattern,
as previously suggested [6], but rather more consistent
with a more recent expansion from few refugia; and
widespread and multiple introgression events from Q.
rotundifolia and Q. coccifera, common in peripheral
western populations.
