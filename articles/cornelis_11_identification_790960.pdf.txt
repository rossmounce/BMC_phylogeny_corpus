Background
A large fraction of vertebrate genomes is composed of
endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), which are remnants of
ancient retroviral infections. In mammals, five retroviral
envelope genes with a placenta-specific expression and a
fusogenic activity, the syncytins, have been independently “captured” in primates, rodents and lagomorphs
(which are all Euarchotonglires mammals) and conserved over more than 30 million years in a functional
state. They are involved in the formation of the syncytiotrophoblast, and are necessary for placental development. Here we searched for syncytins in the Carnivora
order that belongs to the Laurasiatheria, which diverged
from the Euarchotonglires shortly after mammalian
radiation around 100 million years ago.
Methods
Dog and cat genomes were screened for full-length retroviral envelope genes. Candidate genes were assayed
for their placenta-specific expression by quantitative
RT-PCR of RNAs isolated from a large set of tissues,
and by in situ hybridization on placental tissue sections.
Phylogenetic conservation was investigated by cloning
and sequencing of the candidate genes in species representative of major Carnivora branches. Fusogenic activity was assayed by an ex vivo infectivity assay with viral
pseudotypes.

Results
4 and 7 retroviral envelope gene families were found in
the dog and cat respectively. Among them, we identified
an envelope gene shared by both species and specifically
expressed in the placenta at the materno-fetal barrier,
where syncytiotrophoblasts can be found. It is conserved
at the same genomic locus in the 25 species tested, presents strong signature for purifying selection, as usually
observed for a host cellular gene, and has conserved its
fusogenic properties in all species. This gene presents all
the characteristics of a bona fide syncytin gene.
Conclusion
We identified a sixth syncytin in the Carnivora order,
syncytin-Car-1. It is the oldest syncytin identified to
date, conserved for at least 70 million years, and the
first one identified in the Laurasiatheria. Identification
of this new syncytin in a major branch of eutherian
mammals shows that syncytin gene capture is a very
general process, which occurred in several branches during eutherian evolution. The carnivora placental structure is slightly different from that of primates, rodents
and lagomorphs (endotheliochorial vs haemochorial),
and characterization of the syncytins found in various
species might help to understand the impact of these
independently acquired elements on placental diversity.
Study of syncytins brings new insights on the evolutionary relationship between ERVs and their host.
