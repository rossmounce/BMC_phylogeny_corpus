Abstract
Background: Malaria, caused by the parasitic protist Plasmodium falciparum, represents a major
public health problem in the developing world. The P. falciparum genome has been sequenced,
which provides new opportunities for the identification of novel drug targets. Eukaryotic protein
kinases (ePKs) form a large family of enzymes with crucial roles in most cellular processes; hence
malarial ePKS represent potential drug targets. We report an exhaustive analysis of the P. falciparum
genomic database (PlasmoDB) aimed at identifying and classifying all ePKs in this organism.
Results: Using a variety of bioinformatics tools, we identified 65 malarial ePK sequences and
constructed a phylogenetic tree to position these sequences relative to the seven established ePK
groups. Predominant features of the tree were: (i) that several malarial sequences did not cluster
within any of the known ePK groups; (ii) that the CMGC group, whose members are usually
involved in the control of cell proliferation, had the highest number of malarial ePKs; and (iii) that
no malarial ePK clustered with the tyrosine kinase (TyrK) or STE groups, pointing to the absence
of three-component MAPK modules in the parasite. A novel family of 20 ePK-related sequences
was identified and called FIKK, on the basis of a conserved amino acid motif. The FIKK family seems
restricted to Apicomplexa, with 20 members in P. falciparum and just one member in some other
Apicomplexan species.
Conclusion: The considerable phylogenetic distance between Apicomplexa and other Eukaryotes
is reflected by profound divergences between the kinome of malaria parasites and that of yeast or
mammalian cells.

Background
Modulation of protein phosphorylation through the
antagonistic effects of protein kinases and protein phosphatases is a major regulatory mechanism of most cellular
processes. Dysregulation of protein phosphorylation in
human cells plays a major role in many diseases such as

cancers and neurodegenerative disorders [1]. This has
prompted the search for drugs targeting protein kinases,
an endeavour which led in 2002 to the commercialisation
of Gleevec, the first protein kinase inhibitor used as a drug
for human disease [2]. Additional molecules targeting
protein kinases are in clinical trial [3,4], and significant

developments in this field are expected in the next few
years. Some of the most devastating infectious diseases are
caused by protists such as malaria parasites and trypanosomatids: hence, about half the global population lives in
malarious areas, with 10% of the world population contracting the disease each year, which results in 1–3 million
annual deaths. The essential role played by eukaryotic
protein kinases (ePKs) in crucial cellular functions makes
them attractive potential targets for drugs against such
eukaryotic infectious agents [5].
Malaria parasites have a complex life cycle. Infection of
human beings by Plasmodium falciparum, the species
responsible for the lethal form of human malaria, begins
with the bite of an infected Anopheles mosquito, which
delivers sporozoites into the bloodstream. These cells
establish an infection inside hepatocytes, where they
undergo an intense multiplication generating several
thousand merozoites, a process called exo-erythrocytic
schizogony. The merozoites invade erythrocytes, where
they also undergo schizogony, the process that is responsible for malaria pathogenesis. Some merozoites, however, arrest the cell cycle and differentiate into male or
female gametocytes, which are infective to the mosquito.
Once ingested by the insect, the gametocytes develop into
gametes (which for the male cells involves three rapid
rounds of cell division) and fuse into a zygote. Further
development in the mosquito involves a process of sporogony, producing sporozoites that accumulate in the salivary glands and are now ready to infect a new human
host (see http://www.malaria.org for information on
malaria).
The observation that many parasitic ePKs display profound structural and functional divergences from their
counterparts in their vertebrate hosts [5-7] suggests that
specific inhibition is an attainable goal. The availability of
PlasmoDB, a genomic database for Plasmodium falciparum
[8], now permits a systematic analysis of the entire complement of ePKs encoded in the genome (the "kinome")
of this pathogen, an important milestone both in our
understanding of Plasmodium biology and in the definition of potential novel drug targets.
Prior to the genomic era, the initial classification system
of Hanks and Quinn [9] distributed ePKs into four major
groups:
• the cyclic-nucleotide- and calcium/phospholipiddependent kinases (the AGC group);
• the CMGC group, constituted of the cyclin-dependent(CDK), mitogen-activated- (MAPK), glycogen-synthase(GSK) and CDK-like kinases;

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/79

• the calmodulin-dependent kinases (CaMK), and
• the tyrosine kinases (TyrK).
ePKs that did not clearly fit into any of these groups were
placed into the OPK ("other protein kinases") group. The
primary structure of all enzymes in these groups conform
to the model described by Hanks, in which the catalytic
domain is subdivided into eleven subdomains, which can
be aligned across all groups. In addition to the "typical"
ePKs, several enzymes possessing protein kinase activity,
but which are unrelated (or only distantly related) to ePKs
at the primary structure level, have been identified and
termed "atypical protein kinases" (aPKs). These include
phosphatidyl-inositol 3' kinase (PI3K), DNA-dependent
protein kinase, and members of pyruvate dehydrogenase
kinase family.
Exhaustive analyses of the kinome of some model organisms have now been published. The kinome of S. cerevisiae
contains 115 ePKs [10], and the genomes of D. melanogaster, C. elegans and H. sapiens comprise 239, 454 and
510–520 ePK-coding genes, respectively [11-14]. On the
basis of this wealth of new data, three additional major
ePK groups were recognized (reviewed in [15]:
• the casein kinase 1 (CK1) group;
• the STE group, which includes many enzymes functioning in MAPK pathways, although the MAPKs themselves
belong to the CMGC group (STE stands for "sterile", referring to the fact that enzymes belonging to this group were
first identified in genetic analysis of yeast sterile mutants);
• the tyrosine kinase-like (TKL) group, which, as its name
indicates, includes enzymes that are related to those in the
TyrK group, although they are serine-threonine protein
kinases.
Furthermore, a description of the 369 non-receptor serine/threonine protein kinases of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana has recently been published [16]. Comparative
examination of this and previously available kinomes has
demonstrated that members of all major ePK groups can
be found in yeast, worms, insects, mammals and plants,
with the exception of TyrKs, which are not found in yeast.
That most TyrKs function in hormone-response receptorlinked pathways suggests that this family arose as an adaptation to the needs for intercellular communication in
multicellular organisms. It has however been reported
recently
that
a
few
unicellular
eukaryotes
(Chlamydomonoas, Entamoeba and Phytophtora) possess putative TyrK family members [17]. Despite the fact
that most serine-threonine ePKs groups are found in all
eukaryotes, indicating that their appearance occurred

early in evolution, each of the kinomes has nevertheless
its specificities. A striking feature in this respect is the considerable extension of some ePK families in some organisms but not in others. For example, yeast and Drosophila
have 4 and 10 members of the casein kinase 1 (CK1)
group respectively, whereas the C. elegans genome
encodes 85 CK1-related genes.
With the exception of the plant A. thaliana, all eukaryotes
whose kinome has been characterised, from yeast to man,
belong to the Opisthokonta phylogenetic group. As
depicted in Fig. 1, this lineage represents only one small
branch of the eukaryotic tree. Several eukaryotes of high
medical importance, such as malaria parasites (Alveolates) or trypanosomes (Discicristates), belong to phylogenetic groups that are vastly distant from both the
Opisthokonta and Planta branches [18]. This is reflected
by many profound peculiarities in their basic biology (see
[5] for a review). Divergences from model eukaryotes can
also be expected not only at the level of individual protein
kinases of these organisms (as has been previously documented in a number of instances – see [5,6] for reviews),
but at the level of their kinome as well. As is documented
below, our analysis of the P. falciparum kinome confirms
this prediction.

Results and discussion
Overview of the tree
65 sequences related to ePKs were retrieved from PlasmoDB and used to construct a phylogenetic tree as
described in the Methods section (see Additional file 1 for
the alignment). The tree of the P. falciparum kinome (Fig.
2) indicates that although the parasite possesses enzymes
belonging to most of the major serine/threonine kinase
groups, as described in the following paragraphs, several
enzymes do not cluster with any of these groups.
CK1 group
Only one malarial kinase, the previously described PfCK1
[PF11_0377] [19], clearly falls within this group, which is
vastly expanded in some other kinomes (e.g. 85 genes in
C. elegans, see above).
AGC group
Five malarial kinases cluster within this group, three of
which have been characterized: the cAMP-dependent
PfPKA [PFI1685w] [20], the cGMP-dependent PfPKG
[PF14_0346] [21], and PfPKB [PFL2250c] [22], an
enzyme displaying maximal similarity to AKT/PKB. In
other eukaryotes, PKB functions in the PI3K-dependent
pathway; a PI3K kinase homologue is present in the P. falciparum genome (see below). Two additional sequences
[PFC0385c and PF11_0464] form a separate cluster
attached to the base of the AGC branch. There appears to
be no clear member of the PKC subfamily.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/79

CamK group
The main branch of the tree that contains the human
CamKs also contains 13 PfePKs, which underlines the
importance of calcium signalling in the parasite [23]. A
tight cluster is formed by five of these enzymes, which
share the overall structure of the calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) found in plants and ciliates but not
in Metazoans. CDPKs are characterised by the presence of
a kinase catalytic domain located on the same polypeptide as four EF-hand calcium-binding domains. Four of
these enzymes have been described previously: PfCDPK1
[PFB0815w] [24], PfCDPK2 [MAL6P1.108] [25],
PfCDKP3 [PFC0420w] [26] and more recently PfCDPK4
[PF07_0072]. The latter enzyme is expressed in sexual
stages and was shown to be essential for development of
the parasite in the mosquito, through mediating cell cycle
resumption during male gametocyte exflagellation [27]. A
fifth CDPK [PF13_0211], which like the four cited above
possesses four EF-hand motifs, has been discovered in the
present study. PF11_0242 appears to be related to CDPKs,
but contains only one EF-hand motif. PfPK2 [Pfl1885c]
constitutes a sister branch to the CDPK group. This
enzyme was previously characterized as being related to
the CamK family [28], and has no EF-hand domain. No
malarial kinase clusters closely with the mammalian
CamKs used to anchor the tree. Six other sequences, however, form a sister branch to the cluster that contains the
CDPKs; only one of these six sequences (PF11_0239) possesses an EF-hand domain. The CamK activity described
[29] as crucial for ookinete development in the mosquito
vector (see below) is likely to be associated with one of the
enzymes in this group.
CMGC group
Eighteen malarial kinases cluster within this group, which
makes it the most prominent group in the Plasmodium
kinome. Interestingly, in other eukaryotic systems a
majority of CMGC kinases are involved in the control of
cell proliferation and development, and their relative
abundance in the P. falciparum kinome may reflect the
variety of successive proliferative and non-proliferative
stages which constitute the life cycle of malaria parasites.
Six enzymes are related to the cyclin-dependent kinase
family, 5 of which were identified previously (reviewed in
[30]), the last one (Pfcrk-5, [MAL6P1.271]) having been
discovered during the present analysis. Two previously
characterised mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs),
Pfmap-1 [PF14_0294] [31-33] and Pfmap-2 [PF11_0147]
[34], cluster together with a member of the MAPK family,
as expected. Two enzymes, PfPK6 [PF13_0206] [35] and
Pfcrk-4 [PFC0755c] (Equinet, Le Roch and Doerig,
unpublished), display features of both CDKs and MAPKs
according to BLASTP analysis. Their position either in a
cluster (composed of PfPK6 and Pfcrk-5) that is intermediate between the CDK and the MAPK groups, or in a

cluster (composed of Pfcrk-4 and uncharacterized
MAL13P1.196) at the base of the CDK/MAPK/GSK3
branch, is consistent with these early observations. Three
GSK3-related kinases, two of which [PF08_0044 and
PFC0525c] have been characterised previously [36,37],
form a cluster within the CMGC group. Four additional
enzymes form another cluster that includes human Clk1,
one of which is a previously described LAMMER-related
kinase [PF14_0431] [38]. The complexity of the CMGC
group, its relative importance in the P. falciparum kinome,

and our long-standing interest in the control of cell proliferation and differentiation in the parasite, prompted us to
produce a three-species comparative tree of this group
(see below and Fig. 3).
TKL group
Five malarial enzymes appear in the vicinity of the TyrKlike group, including two [MAL6P1.191 and PFB0520w]
that display maximal homology to MAPKKK-related or

analysis. PFB0520w clusters with the TGFβ receptor
(TGFβ1). The malarial sequence is much more similar to
TGFβ receptors than to mammalian Raf, and furthermore,
in common with TGFβ receptors, the malarial enzyme has
a predicted transmembrane sequence N-terminal to the
kinase domain. Mammalian TGFβ receptors assemble as
heterodimers, and it remains to be seen whether the
malarial enzyme forms a homodimer or has the capacity
to coassemble with a mammalian subunit.
Absence of members of the STE and TyrK groups
No malarial protein kinase clusters with the STE7/11/20
group, which is consistent with the lack of success of earlier in vitro and in silico attempts at identifying MAPKK
malarial homologues [39,40] and points to a divergent
organisation of the MAPK pathways in malaria parasites
(see below). It is relevant to mention here that one of the
P. falciparum NIMA-related enzymes (see below) possesses
an activation site that closely mimics that of MEK1/2. This
enzyme, Pfnek-1 [PFL1370w], is able to specifically phosphorylate Pfmap-2 (but neither Pfmap-1 nor mammalian
ERK2) in vitro, and to act in synergy with Pfmap-2 towards
the phosphorylation of exogenous substrates [39]. This
suggests that Pfmap-2 activity may be regulated by Pfnek1. However, the physiological relevance of these finding
remains to be demonstrated. Our tree indicates that members of the TyrK family are absent, as is the case in yeast
and most (but not all) unicellular eukaryotes [17].
Other clusters and "orphan" kinases
Five Plasmodium genes form a cluster of NIMA-related
sequences that includes the NIMA-related kinase Nek1. Of
these five, four are recognised by BLASTP analysis as being
related to the NIMA/Nek family [41], including the well
characterised Pfnek-1 enzyme [39]. The fifth enzyme,
MAL6P1.56, does not cluster with the NIMA-like kinases
in other analyses (not shown).

Several protein kinases appear not to cluster clearly with
any defined group, or to constitute small "satellite" clusters. Examples of such "orphan" kinases are (i) the cluster
formed by PfKIN [PF140516], an enzyme previously
described as related to the SNF1 family [42], with two
uncharacterised PfPKs [PF14_0476 and PF13_0085]. This
cluster is located at the base of the CamK and AGC
branches, and does not strongly associate with any established ePK group (when mammalian NIM1/SNF1-like
kinases were included in the phylogenetic tree no malarial
kinases clustered with them (not shown)). (ii) A group of
three malarial enzymes, including PfPK4 [MAL6P1.146],
a previously characterised HRI kinase homologue [43],
that are similar to mammalian elongation factor kinases,
and form a distinct cluster associated to the NIMA group.
(iii) Several sequences that are isolated at the base of
major branches of the tree, indicating an absence of relat-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/79

edness to established ePK groups. These include the "P.
falciparum exported protein kinase" (PfEST, MAL7P1.91)
[44], which forms an isolated branch at the base of the
part of the tree containing the CMGC, CamK and AGC
groups, PFL2280w, which is in a similar situation, and a
group of two sequences at forming a sister cluster to the
branch containing the AGC and CamK groups. One of
these two sequences, PfPK7 [PFB0605w], displays relatedness to AGC and STE kinases in BLAST analysis (see
below).
So far, four PfePKs have been described as appearing as
"composite" enzymes displaying features from more than
one established ePK family. As mentioned above, PfPK6
[PF130206] and Pfcrk-4 [PFC0755c] both display relatedness to CDKs and MAPKs, and this is confirmed by their
position on the tree. The MAPKK-like activation site of
Pfnek-1 [PFL1370w] has been discussed above. The fourth
example is that of PfPK7 [PFB0605w], an enzyme whose
C-terminal region carries a sequence which is conserved in
MAPKKs but whose N-terminal region is more closely
related to that of PKAs [40]. This sequence does not cluster
with any well-defined group in the tree, although it associates with uncharacterized PFI1415w in a sister cluster to
the major branch containing the AGC and CamK groups.
Whether such "dual" enzymes represent common ancestors to subsequently divergent families which have been
conserved in the evolution of the Apicomplexan lineage,
or whether they arose from domain shuffling between
existing kinase genes, remains to be elucidated. It is possible that additional such "composite" enzymes will be
identified, particularly among the PfPKs which do not
associate with well defined PK groups.
A three-species comparison of CMGC kinases
Because of the large number of CMGC-group kinases
found in the P. falciparum genome, we carried out a more
thorough analysis in which the 18 malarial kinases
belonging to this group were compared with comprehensive sets of related kinases from the yeast and human
genomes (Fig. 3). The phylogenetic tree was constructed
in a similar way to that in Figure 2. 152 amino acid positions from the alignment were used in the construction of
the tree.
Evidence for absence of typical 3-component MAPK pathways
In this analysis, both P. falciparum kinases (Pfmap-1 and
Pfmap-2) previously reported as belonging to the ERK
family clustered, as expected, with the MAP kinases. However, in contrast to previous suggestions brought forward
before the full complement of mammalian ERKs had been
characterised [33,45], they do not specifically cluster with
ERK1/2. Rather, they lie outside the cluster of typical MAP
kinases comprising the p38, JNK and ERK1/2 classes from
human and yeast. Pfmap-2 lies at a basal position relative

to the MAPK family, indicating no preferential relatedness
to any of its subfamilies. Pfmap-1, in contrast, clearly
associates with ERK8, a recently described member of the
ERK family which, like Pfmap-1, has a large extension at
the C-terminus [46]. In the orthologous rat enzyme ERK7,
a similar extension has been shown to be involved in regulation of enzymatic activity [47,48]. It has hence been
proposed that ERK8/7 may not be part of typical threecomponent (MEKK-MEK-MAPK) modules which are the
hallmark of the ERK1/2, p38 and JNK pathways. Formal
demonstration that ERK8/7 is not regulated by classical
MEKs in mammalian cells is difficult because of the
numerous MEK homologues present in the genome. The
situation in P. falciparum therefore provides a first clear
example that in vivo regulation of a kinase related to
ERK8/7 does not require a typical MEK, since no member
of the latter family is present in the parasite's genome (see
above). It is perhaps unsurprising that P. falciparum lacks
MAP kinases of the ERK1/ERK2, p38 of JNK subfamilies,
given the absence of MAPKKs and STE-like MAPKKKs in
the genome. In summary, our data indicate that although
the malaria parasite uses MAPK homologues, these are
not part of three-component modules – to our knowledge, P. falciparum is the first eukaryote demonstrated to
lack such modules.
Cell cycle control kinases
Three P. falciparum kinases cluster with the cell division
kinase group that includes the human cell cycle CDKs.
PfPK5 [MAL13P1.279] appears orthologous to yeast
cdc28 and to human CDK1-3. PfPK5 displays similar levels (60% identity) of overall homology to both mammalian CDK1 and CDK5; however, in our analysis this
enzyme clearly clusters with the former, lending support
to the idea that this enzyme is a functional homologue of
the major cell cycle control kinases, as previously suggested [49,50]. The other two malarial enzymes that
clearly cluster within the CDK group, Pfcrk-3 [PFD0740w]
and Pfcrk-1 [PFD0865c], cannot be assigned an orthology
with any yeast kinase. However, Pfcrk-1 appears to be
related to human CDKs such as CDK10 and CDK11 that
are involved in transcriptional control, consistent with
earlier reports [51] that this enzyme shares primary structure features with the human PITSLRE (CDK11) kinases.
Pfmrk [PFL00141] was initially described [52] as a putative homologue of the CDK-activating kinases (CAKs)
such as mammalian CDK7, and subsequently shown to
be able to undergo some activation by human cyclin H
(the cognate cyclin activator of mammalian CDK7) and
by Pfcyc-1, a P. falciparum protein with maximal homology to cyclin H [50,53]. However, in our tree Pfmrk
appears not to be included in the CDK7 cluster, but
instead lies at an intermediate position between the
MAPK and the CDK groups. It is relevant to mention here
that sequence-based prediction of kinase-cyclin pairs is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/79

difficult: for example, PfPK5, a clear CDK1-3 orthologue,
is unexpectedly activated very efficiently in vitro by human
cyclin H (a CDK7 activator) and p25 (a highly specific
CDK5 activator), among other cyclin-related proteins
[50]. This may be explained by structural properties making this enzyme very prone to adopt the active conformation [54]. Extreme caution must therefore be exercised in
predicting precise functions for the four cyclin-related
proteins which have been identified so far [55].
The positions of the clusters containing (i) PfPK6
[PF130206] [35] and Pfcrk-5 [MAL6P1.271], and (ii)
Pfcrk-4 and uncharacterized MAL13P1.196, are consistent
with the data in the general tree, and confirm the previously detected relatedness of two of these enzymes to
both CDKs and MAPKs. Overall, the number of clear
orthologues of cell division kinases in the P. falciparum
genome is smaller than that in the yeast or human
genomes, and may represent a minimum complement of
such kinases that are necessary for the completion of a
eukaryotic cell cycle. Alternatively, some cell cycle control
functions assured by CDKs in human cells may be taken
over, in Plasmodium, by some of the CMGC kinases with
no clear relatedness to established families.
Other CMGC kinases
A number of CMGC group kinases interact with factors
involved in mRNA splicing. PF11_0156 clearly is an
orthologue of human PRP4, a kinase that is associated
with mRNA splicing and histone deacetylation and that is
conserved in most eukaryotic genomes (including
Schizosaccharomyces pombe, but not Saccharomyces cerevisiae) [56,57]. Human SRPK1 phosphorylates the "SerineArginine-rich pre-mRNA splicing factors" called SR proteins, and homologues are conserved in all eukaryotic
genomes [58,59]. Two P. falciparum kinases (PFC0105w
and PFl4_0408) cluster with SPRK. Both these kinases
have an insertion between domains VIb and VII that is a
distinctive feature of SRPKs. Previously described PfLAMMER [PF14_0431] [38] associates with yeast kns1 [60]
and the related human LAMMER kinases CLK1-4 that also
phosphorylate SR proteins [61].

Other kinases clustering within the CMGC group include
a single orthologue of casein kinase 2α [PF11_0096].
Other eukaryotes have at least 2 alpha subunit-encoding
genes, emphasizing the relative simplicity of the P. falciparum kinome. As detected on the general tree (Fig. 2),
three malarial enzyme cluster with the GSK3 family, the
most closely related to human GSK3α/β being the
recently characterised PfGSK3 [PFC0525c], which appears
to be exported into the host erythrocyte [37].
In several instances our phylogenetic classification of individual kinases differs from the previously reported

Page 8 of 19

classification based on BLAST searches. There are at least
two reasons for this discrepancy. Firstly, our analysis is
based on a comprehensive catalogue of protein kinases
from P. falciparum, and we have access to comprehensive
catalogues from several other organisms. In contrast, several malarial ePKs were classified at the time of their initial
identification several years ago, when the sequences could
be compared only to non-comprehensive sets. As an
example, both P. falciparum MAPKs were identified before
the mammalian ERK8/7 enzymes were discovered, and
the closest sequences available at the time were those of
the ERK1/2 family. Secondly, it has been reported that
BLAST performs poorly in assigning orthology between
human and C. elegans genes [62]. This is because of extensive independent gene duplication on the lineages leading
to the two organisms. Humans and P. falciparum are much
more distantly related and there has been extensive gene
duplication on the human side. Our data support the view
that reliable assignments of orthology between genes in
distantly related species might only be assigned through
the construction of phylogenetic trees and suggest that
comparisons based on BLAST must be interpreted
cautiously.

FIKK, a novel, Apicomplexa-specific group of ePK-related
proteins
That only 65 typical ePKs were identified in this search is
somewhat surprising, as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, whose
genome (12 megabases) is half the size of the P. falciparum
genome (24.8 megabases), encodes approximately twice
as many enzymes of this family.

cule in the catalytic cleft [63]. However, one, and
sometimes two glycine residues are present in subdomain
I of the FIKK sequences. This is also the case in a number
of enzymes with demonstrated protein kinase activity
from many organisms (including P. falciparum) [40], and
it is clearly established that ATP binding and phosphotransfer ability is not dependent on the presence of a Glycine triad. Although lacking the Glycine triad, all FIKK
sequences possess an N-terminal extension, with a conserved tryptophan residue in the region that corresponds
to subdomain I. One of the FIKK sequences is represented
in PlasmoDB as two contiguous ORFs (PF14_0733 and
PF14_0734) separated by a gap. This is presumably due to
erroneous prediction: alignment with other FIKKs clearly
shows these sequences represent two parts of a single
member of the FIKK family rather than two separate
genes. Furthermore, RT-PCR across the two predicted
ORFs demonstrates that both sections are present on the
same mRNA molecule. Interestingly, sequencing of the
RT-PCR product showed that the open reading frame in
the cDNA is interrupted by an in-frame stop codon, which
is presumably the cause of the misprediction of the gene
structure. That this sequence is cDNA than genomic is
ascertained by the presence of an intron near the 3'end
(see Additional file 2). Whether PF14_0733/4 is a transcribed pseudogene, or whether a protein can be produced by readthrough of the internal stop codon as has
been documented for another P. falciparum gene [64],
remains to be determined. In any case, it appears there are
only 20 FIKK sequences in the genome, instead of the 21
that were counted originally (see above).

In preliminary analyses, 21 sequences identified in the
HMM search appeared to form a tight cluster that is relatively distantly related to the more typical ePK groups discussed above. Based on an amino acid motif
corresponding to subdomain II of the ePK catalytic
domain, and which is well conserved in members of this
novel family, we called this group "FIKK". In addition to
the ePK catalytic domain-like region, the FIKK sequences
all have a highly variable N-terminal extension, and in
some cases the catalytic domain itself is interrupted by
large insertions (as is the case for several of the 65 "typical" malarial ePKs, see below). An alignment of the FIKK
kinase-like domain with the 65 typical ePKs in the P. falciparum genome showed that they share most of the residues that are conserved in the ePK catalytic domain.
Indeed, with the exception of the Glycine triad in subdomain I, all residues which are crucial for phosphotransfer or structural stability of protein kinases, and therefore
well conserved throughout the family, are present in all
members of this family (see Table 1 and Fig. 4). In contrast, no FIKK sequence possesses a full Glycine triad
(GxGxxG) in subdomain I. This triad is present in a majority of ePKs and is involved in positioning the ATP mole-

In addition to the residues conserved in typical ePKs, several amino-acid motifs are fully conserved in all members
of the FIKK family (Fig. 4 and 5). These can be used to
define signature motifs, which allowed us to perform a
number of motif searches in various databases, to determine whether members of this ePK-like family are present
in other organisms. Interestingly, sequences containing
such motifs could be retrieved only from Apicomplexan
species: 20 sequences in the P. falciparum genome, one in
P. berghei (Pb75h08p1c-3-1074-4583), one in P. yoelii
(chrPy1 00951-1-3319-5523), one in P. knowlesi
(Pk2145b11q1c-4-8079-3688) and one in P. vivax
(Pv402596-4-9942-5746). In contrast, no FIKK family
member was found in the (yet incompletely sequenced)
genomes of P. chabaudi or P. reichenowi. Searches of the
NRprot database, which contained sequences representing all eukaryotic and prokaryotic phyla, yielded only the
Plasmodium sequences mentioned above (20 in P. falciparum, and one each in P. berghei, yoelii, knowlesi and
vivax). In agreement with the motif searches, BLAST analysis of the NRprot database with PF10_0160 finds 20 Plasmodium falciparum and one yoelii sequences among the top
hits (E < 10-37). Weaker hits (E > 10-5) are mostly MAPKs

Table 1: Variability in key residues of the protein kinase catalytic domain. The residues indicated at the top are: G1, G2, G3, the three
residues constituting the glycine triad (corresponding to G51, 53 and G56 in human PKAα), and which form a hairpin enclosing part of
the ATP molecule; the lysine in subdomain II (K73), which contacts the α- and β-phosphate of ATP, anchoring and orienting the ATP;
the glutamate of subdomain III (E92), which forms a salt bridge with the former residue; the aspartate and asparagine within the
HRDXXXXN signature motif of ePKs in subdomain VIB (D167, N172), the former of which is thought to be the catalytic residue acting
as a base acceptor; the aspartate in the DFG motif of subdomain VII (D185), which binds to the Mg2+ (or Mn2+) ion associated with the
β-and γ-phosphates of ATP; the glutamate in subdomain VIII (E209), which forms a salt bond with the arginine in subdomain XI and
provides structural stability of the C-terminal lobe; and the aspartate in subdomain IX (D221), which is involved in structural stability
of the catalytic loop of subdomain VI through hydrogen bonding with the backbone. The conservation status of these residues in the 65
malarial typical ePKs is summarized at the top of the Table, and that of the 20 FIKK family members is presented at the bottom. It is
immediately apparent that with the exception of the Glycine triad in subdomain I, all important residues are extremely well conserved

homologue). Asterisks indicate those residues that are invariant in all 20 FIKK sequences.

from a variety of organisms. Further investigations using
Apicomplexan genome project databases (Sanger and
TIGR) allowed us to identify one such sequence in Toxoplasma gondii and one in Cryptosporidium parvum. Taken
together, these data strongly suggest that the FIKK group is
specific to Apicomplexa, and has undergone a dramatic
expansion in P. falciparum. Interestingly, of the 20 FIKK
sequences in the P. falciparum genome, 7 are located on
chromosome 9, where they are arranged in a contiguous
subtelomeric tandem array, a common location for genes
involved in antigenic variation such as those of the var/
PfEMP1 [65] or Rifin [66] families (Fig. 6). On the tree
depicted in Fig. 6, these sequences (PFI0095c to
PFI0125c) tend to cluster together. The structure of the
tree (no major subgroups, with most of the branch points
very close to each other and a fairly uniform branch
length) suggests a rapid and presumably recent expansion
of the family. This hypothesis is supported by the presence

of the tandem array, an indicator of gene duplication. Furthermore, the presence of only one FIKK gene in several
other apicomplexan species is consistent with the expansion in P. falciparum being a recent event. Obviously, a
definite conclusion about the species distribution of this
gene family will have to await the completion of additional genome sequencing projects, especially with
respect to other Plasmodium species and other Apicomplexan genera.
Although no experimental evidence is available that associates PK activity with any of the FIKK sequences, the fact
that all residues required for phosphotransfer and ePK
folding are present strongly suggests that these proteins
are indeed protein kinases. Some FIKKs have a predicted
signal peptide (PFD1165w, PFE0045c, MAL13P1.109,
PFI0095c, PFI0105c, PFI0110c) and/or transmembrane
helix (PFD1165w, PFD1175w, PF10_0160, PFI0110c,

PFI0125c, PFI0100c has two) at the N-terminus. Otherwise, aside from their similarity to the kinase domain, no
recognised Pfam domains are found in these proteins.
Two of the FIKK sequences have been identified as P. falciparum antigens in the context of immunological studies:
the R45 trophozoite antigen (PFD1175w) [67] and the
3.8 protein (PF10_0160). No function has previously
been attributed to either of these proteins. R45 has a large
insertion of 570 residues, comprising mostly His, Lys,
Asn, Ser and Asp residues, relative to the other members
of the FIKK family. The belonging of R45 to a 20-sequence
family in the P. falciparum genome has been discovered
independently in the context of research into the R45 antigen (Schneider and Puijalon, personal communication, to
be published elsewhere).
Features of gene structure
Table 1 presents the degree of conservation, in malarial
ePKs, of residues that play a crucial role in ePK enzyme
function (see legend to Table 1 for details). As is the case
in ePKs from other eukaryotes, the Glycine triad is not
complete in many PfPKs and in all FIKKs, and none of the
three glycine residues are present in 8 of the 65 "typical"
ePfPKs. Other important residues are better conserved in
the malarial PKs. The observation that some sequences
(e.g. PF11_0060, PF14_0733 and MAL7P1.18) lack more
than one of these conserved residues raises the question of
their ability to function as protein kinases. These may represent kinase-dead scaffold proteins similar to those
found in other eukaryotes, such as KSR [68]. In contrast,
all 20 FIKKs possess essentially all these residues, despite
a conservative D > E substitution in subdomain IX of
PF14_0733.

Like in many other plasmodial proteins, large extensions
rich in charged and/or polar residues, and in some cases
repeated amino acid motifs, are found adjacent to the catalytic domain of several PfPKs. Several enzymes also carry
such sequences as insertions within the catalytic domain.
The function of these elements is as yet undetermined,
although there is evidence in some cases [e.g. Pfmap-1,
[32]] that extensions are absent from the enzymes in parasite protein extracts, presumably as a result from proteolytic cleavage. In some sequences (e.g. PFD0740w [Pfcrk3] and PFC0755c [Pfcrk-4]), large insertions have been
mapped to the hinge region between adjacent β-sheets in
the N-terminal lobe; hence, it can be argued that such
insertions may not interfere with proper folding of the catalytic domain (Equinet and Doerig, unpublished).
Organelle targeting
Malaria parasites possess two organelles with extra-chromosomal DNA: the apicoplast and the mitochondrion.
The apicoplast is a four-membrane organelle carrying a
circular 35 kb DNA whose structure is very similar to that

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/79

of plastid genomes. It is specific to the Apicomplexa
(hence its name), and thought to originate from secondary endosymbiosis [69]. As is the case for chloroplasts in
plants [70], it appears that many genes whose products
are essential for apicoplast function and survival have
been transferred to the "host cell" nucleus; products of
these genes must be addressed back to the organelle. A
bipartite peptide has been identified and shown to be necessary and sufficient for targeting a protein to the apicoplast [71]. The 35 kb genome of the apicoplast does not
encode any PK, but it is to be expected that protein phosphorylation is necessary for function and maintenance of
the organelle. We used an algorithm available on PlasmoDB to determine that 5/65 typical ePfPKs (including 2
NIMA-related kinases) and 6/18 FIKKs are predicted to be
addressed to the apicoplast (see Fig. 7). Likewise, four
kinases (none of them of the FIKK family) possess a
potential mitochondrion-targeting signal sequence, as
defined by the algorithm available on PlasmoDB [72]. It
is important to emphasise that presence or absence of targeting signals relies on gene structure prediction algorithms, which have been demonstrated to be erroneous in
some instances (see ref. [55] for an example); therefore
this must be considered with caution until the 5'end of
the cDNAs has been sequenced, and targeting to the
organelle has been verified experimentally by the transfection of constructs expressing GFP-tagged proteins.
Regulatory subunits
Proteins devoid of kinase activity but which are known to
associate with, and regulate the activity of, ePKs have been
identified in PlasmoDB. These include four previously
characterised cyclins [PF14_0605, PF13_0022, PFL1330c
and PFE0920c] which have been demonstrated to associate with histone H1 kinase activities in parasite extracts
[50,55], a PKA regulatory subunit [PFL1110c], which as
expected is able to down-regulate PKA in parasite extracts
(Merckx and Doerig, unpublished), and two putative CK2
regulatory subunits [PF11_0048 and PF13_0232].
Genes encoding aPKs
BLASTP searches of PlasmoDB were performed using
atypical protein kinases (aPKs) from Homo sapiens as queries. GeneDB was also used to look for relevant Pfam
domains (ABC1, FAT, FATC, Bromodomain, RIO). Two
members of the RIO kinase family were found: PFL1490w
(RIOK1-like) and PFD0975w (RIOK2-like). Enzymes of
this family are involved in rRNA processing in S. cerevisiae
[73]. We also identified two putative members of the
ABC1 family of atypical protein kinases [PF08_0098 and
PF14_0143]. Some P. falciparum genes (e.g. PFD0685c
and PF14_0326) display regions with low-level similarity
to the histidine kinase domain (scores between 4 and 5
with Pfam entries PF00512 and PF06580), but the significance of this observation remains to be established.

Figure 7 (see previous page)
P. falciparum ePKs and related proteins, and stage-specificity of their expression
P. falciparum ePKs and related proteins, and stage-specificity of their expression. PlasmoDB gene identifiers are
indicated in the left column, followed by the published names where applicable. Identifiers of enzymes belonging to defined ePK
groups appear in color (see the inset for color codes). Microarray data from the Le Roch et al. and Bozdech et al. studies available on PlasmoDB, were compiled to produce the third column. Genes were arranged in function of the timing of their expression according to Bozdech et al., to illustrate the fact essentially all of them are expressed in a regulated way during
erythrocytic schizogony, and that this process involves sequential but overlapping expression of most kinases in the genome.
The phaseogram (data generated by Bozdech et al. and available on the PlasmoDB website) represent the relative abundance of
mRNAs throughout the erythrocytic asexual cycle, measured by two-colour competitive hybridisation between total RNA
from each time point and a reference pool of total RNA from all time points (48 time points, i.e. one per hour during the 48
hours of the asexual cycle, starting one hour post invasion). The phaseogram shows the red/green colorimetric representation
of the gene expression ratio for each oligonucleotide. Green: negative ratio (no expression), red: positive ratio (expression);
grey or white: no data. See Bozdech et al. (2003) and PlasmoDB for details. To the right of the phaseogram, the presence or
absence of mRNA in samples from merozoites (M), gametocytes (G) and sporozoites (S) is indicated by red boxes (data generated by Le Roch et al.). Where only one of the two synchronised merozoite population gave a signal, the M box is colored in
orange (see Le Roch et al. 2003 for details). Columns to the right indicate those molecules which, according to the gene prediction algorithm used in PlasmoDB, possess a putative apicoplast or mitochondrion targeting sequence (see text for details).

No significant hits were obtained with A6 kinases, Alpha
kinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, aminoglycoside
phosphotransferases or DNA-dependent kinases. In contrast, we identified a malarial phosphatidyl-inositol-3
kinase homologue [PFE0765w], in agreement with experimental studies [74] and the presence of a PKB homologue (see above) demonstrating the presence of a
phosphatidyl-inositol pathway in the parasite. However,
the PI3K homologue, like two other sequences
(PFE0485w and PFD0965w) related to PI4K, appears not
to contain the FAT and FATC domains which are present
in PIKs from other organism and have been associated
with protein kinase activity [75]. Hence, it may be that
these three enzymes function solely as phosphatidylinositol kinases, a proposition that requires experimental testing. Overall, these results on malarial aPKs contrast with
those obtained from the recently-sequenced L. major, T.
brucei and T. cruzi genomes, where ABC1 and RIO kinases
were found, as were PIKK (with the FAT and FATC
domains), PDHK and Alpha kinase family members (Parsons and Ward, unpublished).
Expression pattern of PfPKs during the P. falciparum life
cycle
Data from two studies [76,77] of the P. falciparum transcriptome during development are available on the PlasmoDB database. We compiled these data to obtain a
general picture of PfePK gene expression during erythrocytic development (Fig. 7). It is clear that the steady-state
level of mRNA is developmentally regulated for all the
PfPK genes, in accordance with the unique gene expression pattern described in this organism by Bozdech et al.
[76]. Most of the PfePKs are expressed in trophozoites and
schizonts, but some PK mRNAs are clearly predominantly
detected in rings, the younger form following erythrocyte
invasion. Data from Le Roch et al. [77] included a tran-

scriptome analysis of additional development stages: free
merozoites, gametocytes and sporozoites. Compilation of
data from this study indicated that a small number of
PfePKs are specific to gametocytes, including two of the
NIMA-related kinases (one of which is potentially targeted to the apicoplast), one of the MAPKs (Pfmap-2),
and PfKIN, an enzyme previously described as related to
the SNF1 family (see above). Gametocyte-specific expression had been described in the literature for the latter two
enzymes [42,45]. Overall, and despite some discrepancies, there is good agreement between the two studies with
respect to PfePK genes, as illustrated by the observation
that PfePKs whose expression is detected in late schizonts
and segmenters by Bozdech et al. are also detected in free
merozoites by Le Roch et al. At least some of these
enzymes are likely to play a role in invasion of the erythrocyte by the merozoite. As expected, the PK genes that are
gametocyte-specific according to Le Roch et al. (and hence
likely to play a role during sexual development of the parasite) give low intensity signals in the dataset from Bozdech et al. (see for example Pfmap-2 or Pfnek-4 to
illustrate this point).

Conclusion
This study has allowed us to classify the 65 typical ePKs
encoded by the P. falciparum genome, and to establish the
presence of a novel group of ePK-related genes, the FIKK
family, which, from analysis of currently available databases, appears to be specific to Apicomplexa and considerably extended in P. falciparum. The number of genes
encoding protein kinases is somewhat smaller than
expected from analogy with other organisms. We cannot
exclude that our study, which is based on sequence similarity with ePKs, may have missed genes encoding proteins with protein kinase activity, but with a primary
structure that would be too divergent from that of known
Page 15 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2004, 5:79

ePKs to be identified. Nevertheless, it is hoped that the
present study will facilitate investigations into the regulation of many pathways and processes operating during
growth and development of the parasite. In addition to
the FIKKs, several malarial ePKs belong to "orphan"
groups, as they do not cluster clearly with established ePK
groups as defined in model organisms. Furthermore, our
analysis provides evidence that elements which are usually found in eukaryotes are absent or dramatically modified in malaria parasites. Such elements include MAPK
pathway components and PKC, for example. These
important divergences between the malarial and human
kinomes reflects the vast phylogenetic distance between
Apicomplexans and Opisthokonta, and strengthen our
expectations that specific interference with essential
functions of the parasite can be achieved through the use
of protein kinase inhibitors.

Methods
Identification of ePK genes in the P. falciparum genome
The set of predicted peptides of the Plasmodium falciparum
genome 3D7 [78] was downloaded from PlasmoDB [8]. A
Hidden Markov Model search [79] of the predicted proteins encoded by the genome was carried out using a
eukaryotic protein kinase profile downloaded from the
Pfam database [80]. In addition, PlasmoDB was searched
for proteins carrying a Gene Ontology molecular function
assignment
[81]
of
'protein
kinase
activity'
(GO:0004672). This allowed us to constitute an initial list
of 108 sequences. After inspection, 15 were removed that
had high e-value (>0.01), low HMM scores (<-110) and
visibly lacked a protein kinase domain. The remaining 93
sequences were aligned using our own Hidden Markov
Model, trained on a complete set of human protein
kinases, to check for the presence of the key kinase motifs.
In addition, the genomic context of each putative kinase
gene was examined to check for missing exons using
GeneDB http://www.genedb.org and Artemis [82]. Eight
proteins, the first four of which have a PlasmoDB enzyme
assignment to EC2.7.1 (phosphotransferases), lacked sufficient similarity to typical eukaryotic protein kinases to
be aligned meaningfully across the kinase domain. These
sequences were: PF13_0166, PFC0945w, PFE0170c,
PFI1275w, MAL7P1.127, MAL7P1.132, PF11_0079 and
PF14_0264; they were removed from further analysis. A
further 20 sequences constituted the FIKK family (see
below). This set of closely related, but atypical, sequences
was analysed separately. The remaining 65 sequences represent the complement of typical protein kinases in P. falciparum. Although the Hidden Markov Model used for the
alignment is based on an extensive training set, the alignment did require some manual optimisation. This is
partly because of the extreme diversity of the gene family
and partly because many predicted proteins from P. falciparum contain large repetitive insertions (Hidden Markov

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/79

Model-based alignment protocols would be expected to
cope better in these circumstances than other common
methods). A full alignment of the kinase domains is
shown in Additional file 1. Once a definitive set of the 65
sequences representing typical ePKs had been assembled,
a phylogenetic tree was produced using Phylip [83], with
the Protdist and Fitch algorithms. Human protein kinases
were added to the alignment in order to improve the visualization of the main groups of protein kinases among
the P. falciparum sequences. Only gap-free conserved
regions of the alignment were used for the construction of
the tree (164 amino acid positions). Bootstrap values supporting the branches of the tree are rather low; this is to be
expected given the diversity of the protein kinase family.

Authors' contributions
PW performed most of the database searches for ePKrelated sequences and constructed the FIKK phylogenetic
tree; LE contributed to the searches for aPKs, compiled
expression data and performed the in silico and in vitro
analyses of the FIKK family. JP generated the HMMderived alignments, constructed the ePK phylogenetic
trees and contributed significantly to their description in
the text. CD coordinated the study and wrote the larger
part of the manuscript. All authors read and approved the
manuscript.
