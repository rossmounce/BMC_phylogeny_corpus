Abstract
Background: Gene-targeted and genome-wide markers are crucial to advance evolutionary biology, agriculture,
and biodiversity conservation by improving our understanding of genetic processes underlying adaptation and
speciation. Unfortunately, for eukaryotic species with large genomes it remains costly to obtain genome sequences
and to develop genome resources such as genome-wide SNPs. A method is needed to allow gene-targeted, nextgeneration sequencing that is flexible enough to include any gene or number of genes, unlike transcriptome
sequencing. Such a method would allow sequencing of many individuals, avoiding ascertainment bias in
subsequent population genetic analyses.
We demonstrate the usefulness of a recent technology, exon capture, for genome-wide, gene-targeted marker
discovery in species with no genome resources. We use coding gene sequences from the domestic cow genome
sequence (Bos taurus) to capture (enrich for), and subsequently sequence, thousands of exons of B. taurus, B.
indicus, and Bison bison (wild bison). Our capture array has probes for 16,131 exons in 2,570 genes, including 203
candidate genes with known function and of interest for their association with disease and other fitness traits.
Results: We successfully sequenced and mapped exon sequences from across the 29 autosomes and X
chromosome in the B. taurus genome sequence. Exon capture and high-throughput sequencing identified
thousands of putative SNPs spread evenly across all reference chromosomes, in all three individuals, including
hundreds of SNPs in our targeted candidate genes.
Conclusions: This study shows exon capture can be customized for SNP discovery in many individuals and for
non-model species without genomic resources. Our captured exome subset was small enough for affordable nextgeneration sequencing, and successfully captured exons from a divergent wild species using the domestic cow
genome as reference.

Background
Our understanding of the molecular, genetic basis of
adaptations and phenotypic differentiation among individuals will advance quickly thanks to new molecular
techniques. This understanding is crucial given that
accelerating environmental change and human population growth are increasingly threatening natural populations of fish and wildlife as well as increasing demands
for agricultural production in domesticated species. This
makes it urgent in many wild and domestic species to
investigate the genetic basis of fitness, adaptation, and

disease resistance [1], and to discover adaptive genes and
speciation genes, i.e., the “loci of evolution” [2].
Understanding the genetic basis of phenotypes generally requires genotyping thousands of gene-targeted loci,
genome-wide. Despite the declining costs of next generation DNA sequencing (summarized in [3]), it remains
costly enough to prohibit analyzing large portions of genomes in numerous individuals as is required for population studies (e.g. population genomics, [4]). Fortunately,
with coding gene sequences (the exome) comprising a
mere 2% of the typical eukaryotic genome, and the development of techniques for isolating exome DNA, resequencing coding portions genome-wide can be done at
a reasonable per-sample cost, locating thousands of
informative gene markers. Because exon sequences are
relatively conserved we hypothesized that most exons

Results and discussion
We sequenced genomic DNA from our three individuals,
enriched for 16,131 exons (~ 3 million base pairs) by
hybridization to probes on a microarray. Reference exon
sequences came from sampling an average of 6 exons
from each of 2,367 genes spread evenly across the 29
autosomes and the X chromosome. We also chose 203
candidate genes with known associations with disease
susceptibility and other important traits. For all candidate
genes, the entire exon sets were targeted for capture.

Illumina Genome Analyzer sequencing of the enriched
DNA, followed by mapping of the 36 base-pair, single
end sequence reads and consensus genotyping with Maq
software [12], yielded high-confidence nucleotide base
calls (see Methods for our base calling criteria) comprising 77% of our targeted exonic positions in the taurine,
80% in the zebu and 82% in the bison (Figure 1). The
called single-nucleotide genotypes differed from the
reference across the genome at positions totalling
11,061 in the bison, 5,524 in the zebu, and 3,854 in the
taurine (Figure 2a).
As a percentage of total targeted nucleotides with high
confidence base calls, 0.5% of the bison calls differed from
the reference taurine, compared to 0.2% for each of the
two Bos species. The higher percentage of differences in
the bison is expected in light of its one to two million
years of genetic separation from the taurine cattle (B.
taurus) [13]. The divergence between the two species in
the target region of the exome estimated by our results,
about 5 differences in every thousand bases, is likely conservative, given the limitations of mapping software in
accounting for real base differences versus incorrect
sequencer base calls (discussed in Methods and in [12]).
In our 203 candidate genes, we identified 339 putative
heterozygous SNPs among 96 genes in the bison, 598
heterozygous SNPs in 123 genes in the zebu, and 372 in
92 genes in the taurine. It is encouraging that from only
one individual zebu, for example, we find high-confidence SNP calls in 60% of our 203 candidate genes of
interest for future research. For all targeted base pairs,
2,525 heterozygous positions were called in our taurine,
3,890 in the zebu, and 2,426 in the bison (Figure 2b,

from one species (e.g. with a sequenced genome) could
be used to capture exons from another species for use in
next generation sequencing for SNP discovery.
Exon capture enriches for exon DNA by simultaneous
hybridization of fragmented genomic DNA from the
study individual to many thousands of oligonucleotide
probes (e.g. refs. [5,6]) that are complementary to genecoding (exon) sequences. The captured fragments are
then sequenced in parallel on next-generation sequencing platforms. Exon capture has been tested almost
exclusively in model species (e.g. refs. [7-9]), typically
baiting either the whole exome or a single chromosomal
region. Facilitated by availability of genome sequences
for the target organism, such studies leave untested the
potential application of exon capture to a wider variety
of organisms. Probe design for exome-wide capture
requires knowledge of thousands of exon sequences.
With few fully sequenced eukaryotic genome sequences
available (to date, 40 complete, 425 draft whole genome
sequences are found at NCBI’s Entrez gene service), it
would appear to be useful for only a small proportion of
eukaryotic species. Even if 10,000 vertebrate genomes
are eventually sequenced [10], there would still remain
tens of thousands of vertebrate species without genome
sequences or any genome resources.
Here we show that the exon capture method has a
more general application, reporting exon capture in two
livestock species, Bos taurus (taurine cattle) and Bos indicus (zebu cattle), and one wildlife species, Bison bison
(American bison). We conducted all three captures
through hybridization to sequences from the published
Bos taurus genome [11]. We baited a small genome-wide
fraction of the exome, sampling exons in about 10% of
the taurine genome’s estimated minimum total of 22,000
genes [11]. Our results demonstrate that genetic divergence between a reference genome and individuals queried does not prohibit exome-wide identification of
candidate SNPs and differences (e.g., substitutions) in
non-model species. This suggests the method can be
applied to many domestic and wildlife species lacking
sequenced genomes. Further, we found that baiting a
small fraction of the exome yielded thousands of candidate heterozygous SNPs.

Table 1). Concordance of some of our called single-base
differences with published SNPs is indicated by the 545
(about 14%) of our taurine variant calls matching in position and all but one allele among 1.8 million NCBI
dbSNP [14] records positioned on the same reference
genome used in our study. As expected we found lower
dbSNP concordance in our non-taurus individuals; about
11% among our zebu’s called differences were matched
in dbSNP and 4% of our bison’s SNP calls had matches
(Table 1).

Conclusions
Our results demonstrate two novel strategies for exon
capture: (1) Sampling a small but genome-wide subset of
the exome for discovery of thousands of putative SNPs,
and (2) successful bait and capture across relatively divergent genomes. Result (1) reduces the cost of sequencing
the capture products, making genome-wide SNP discovery more affordable. Exon capture with a subset of exons
can complement large genotyping projects (e.g. in [15])
by facilitating discovery of thousands of SNPs based on
assaying many individuals to avoid ascertainment bias in
population genetic inferences [16]. Further, it allows genotyping of both candidate genes and genome-wide loci,
combining the strengths of the candidate gene and genome scan approaches commonly used to identify adaptive
and economically important loci.
Result (2) makes feasible these analyses in natural
populations of divergent species with lesser-known genomes and from diverse environments worldwide, e.g.
domestic and wild bovids from Siberia to the tropics.
The conservation of exon sequences appears sufficient
for the method to enable genome-wide studies based on
probing across taxa as phylogenetically divergent as
American bison and taurine cattle. Future research
should test increased divergence between organisms

dbSNP, 10 showed alleles different than those listed at dbSNP.

referenced and baited to see how wide a taxonomic distance the method can bridge.
With success across many taxa while targeting a high
value part of the exome small enough for affordable
next-generation sequencing of many individuals, exon
capture can be a powerful application of high-throughput genomics to the genetic analysis of populations,
even in species with enormous genomes but no wholegenome reference. It has exciting potential to reveal in
unprecedented detail the genetic basis of evolution,
including adaptive differentiation and speciation.

Methods
Genomic DNA extraction

Three female individuals, each from Bos taurus (Portugal), Bos indicus (India), and Bison bison (USA) were
used for this study. We used genomic DNA samples
stored for many years in our labs (at the University of
Porto and the University of Montana). The samples
from cattle have been used in several published works
related to the population genetics of cattle. The cattle
biological tissue source from which the genomic DNA
was isolated was ear skin (<2 mm2), extracted by
DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen). The bison sample
was from lymph node tissue obtained from an abattoir
with Tissue Use Approval provided by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (identification number
TU01-11GLDBS-040511) at the University of Montana.
The obtaining of genomic data for this work did not
involve experimental procedures or manipulation of living animals.
Selecting exon sequence targets

16,131 exon sequences were selected from the Btau 4.0,
Bos taurus genome sequence [11], as annotated by the
alignment of mRNA’s from the NCBI RefSeq database
[17] by the BLAT program [18], the alignment available
at the UCSC genome browser web site [19]. Complete
exon sets were collected for 203 genes selected by
name. Most of these were found to be annotated as
above, the few remaining annotations found through
NCBI’s Entrez genome site [20]. Other than those collected for the 203 selected genes, exon sequences came
from an exome-wide sampling by iterating many times
over the chromosome sequences, choosing one gene
annotation on visiting each chromosome. Longer chromosomes were visited more often proportionally to their
total base pair (bp) count. As each chromosome was visited in turn, the exon sequences were collected from the
gene whose midpoint coordinate was closest to the (currently) largest, contiguous non-sampled span of the
chromosome sequence.
To meet our goal of sampling about 2,000 genes and
keeping the total bases to about three million we

Cosart et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:347
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/347

collected no more than 1,500 exon base pairs per gene,
except for the 203 named genes. To look for sequence
variation in regulatory regions of genes, for all genes we
collected the exon containing the 5’ UTR, then chose
randomly from among the remaining exons until adding
an exon brought the total base pair count above 1,500.
If a gene had only exons longer than 1,500 bps, we
sampled 750 from each end of the 5’ terminal exon. For
genes other than those 203 for which all exons were collected, we collected no exons with fewer than 40 bps. As
exon sequence candidates were chosen, the BLAST program [21] was used to remove any exon with at least 40
contiguous base pairs showing more than 90% identity
with a subsequence in an exon already collected.
Targeted capture by hybridization

Hybridization probes for a microarray (Agilent, 244K
aCGH format) were designed as previously described
[5]. A single array was used per individual and hybridization performed as previously described.
Sequencing

Sequencing of post-enrichment shotgun libraries was carried out on Illumina Genome Analyzers (GA) I and II, one
lane per individual on each Analyzer, as single-end 36 bp
reads, following the manufacturer’s protocols and using
the standard sequencing primer. Image analysis and base
calling was performed by the Genome Analyzer Pipelines
with default parameters, but with no pre-filtering of reads
by quality. In the reads produced by the GAII lanes, quality values were estimated directly by the Illumina software.
A recalibration of the base qualities from the GAI lanes
was performed during mapping as described below.
Sequencing reads are being submitted to the NCBI Short
Read Archive under accession SRA037397.1.
Mapping of sequencer reads

We used Maq software version 0.7.1 [12] to map the
reads to the reference Bos taurus genome sequence and
compute consensus genotypes at all positions covered
by a uniquely mapped read. We used Maq’s “map” command with default parameters, except when testing the
bison reads using the “map” command’s parameter “-m”
(detailed below in the section, Calling single-base differences to the reference).
Reads produced by the GAII were mapped twice.
Before a final mapping preliminary mappings were filtered by in-house programs to create a final collection
of reads, under the following criteria:
1. Reads not uniquely mapped were discarded.
2. Reads that mapped off-target, so that no base in
the read was aligned to a targeted exon base pair,
were discarded.

Page 5 of 8

3. Reads representing likely polymerase chain reaction (PCR) duplicates were removed by discarding,
in any group of reads that mapped identically at
position and strand, all but the read with the highest
sum of base qualities.
The final mapping of the reads produced by the GAI
was preceded by two preliminary mappings, both of
which involved the same steps (1-3 above) performed
for the GAII. For GAI reads, however, the filtered set of
reads produced by the first mapping was used solely to
recalibrate (with an in-house program) Illumina base
quality scores, in order to estimate a correction performed by Illumina software supplied with the GAII but
missing from the GAI. The recalibration treated all mismatches in the (filtered, on-target) initial mappings as
sequencer error, under the assumption that the great
majority of mismatches were errors in the reads. An
error rate was calculated as the ratio of mismatches to
matches for all mapped bases with a given sequencergenerated base quality score. The sequencer-generated
base quality scores were then replaced with the (generally lower) quality based on the calculated error rate.
This calibration was done separately for our taurine and
zebu individuals. After finding a severe reduction in
quality scores when the error rates were calculated
based on the bison reads, the final bison quality recalibration was based on an average of the error rates
found for the two Bos species, under the assumption
that the relative wealth of mismatches between the
bison and the reference likely reflected an abundance of
real differences, and in total would significantly overestimate sequencing error rates. All of the GAI reads, with
recalibrated base qualities, were then mapped twice
using the procedure described above for the GAII reads.
After recalibration and removal of likely PCR duplicates,
uniquely mapped reads for the bison totalled 11,384,125,
for the zebu 11,432,216, and the taurine 7,154,561. Of
these, bison on-target reads totalled 2,653,386 (23% of
uniquely mapped reads), for the zebu, 2,320,339 on-target
(20%), and the taurine, 2,105,157 (29%).
As a final note on mapping, it was found that duplicate mappings, using the same MAQ map command
(with default parameters), and the same reads and reference data yielded slightly different results. Most of the
differences in mappings were a single point difference in
mapping score for a read on one execution versus the
duplicate execution. An inquiry to the authors of [12]
has been made and a more precise accounting of the
differences is in progress.
Calling single-base differences to the reference

Consensus genotyping by Maq of targeted exon positions covered by the mapped reads identified both

candidate homozygous differences from the reference
sequence and heterozygous SNPs. Analyses of differences to the reference were based on consensus genotypes with at least 8 × coverage and a Maq Phred-like
consensus quality score of 30 or more. Emulating methods in [5] by removing likely PCR duplicate reads and
recalibrating base qualities as described above, we then
chose our minimum coverage and depth values for

high-confidence genotype calls based on the findings in
[5] that Maq-based genotype calls with at least these
coverage and depth values were in high concordance
with genotypes inferred by several alternative resequencing methods. We also tested variant calls by Sanger
resequencing DNA from our three individuals in regions
in five of our 203 candidate genes in which our exon
capture analysis found likely variants (Table 2). In these

Variant calls in several Sanger sequenced fragments in and near exons in the genes indicated, compared with Maq consensus bases. All variant calls in the
Sanger sequenced regions for the bison and zebu are in agreement with the Maq consensus bases. For the taurine five positions (rows in bold) are called as
variant by the Maq consensus but not by the Sanger sequenced fragments.

regions Sanger-sequence-based genotypes were in concordance with 19 variant calls for the bison, 12 for the
zebu, and 4 for the taurine. Neither the bison nor zebu
showed any false positives for the regions, while our
taurine individual showed 5 false positives (Table 2).
Further indication of lower accuracy in the taurine is
seen in the deflated transition-to-transversion ratio
(2.94) in heterozygous positions not found in dbSNP
versus the ratio for those found in dbSNP (3.74). For
the zebu, transition-to-transversion ratios are 3.17 for
heterozygous positions not found in dbSNP, and 3.03
for heterozygous positions matched in dbSNP. Because
our bison individual had only 22 matched heterozygous
positions in dbSNP, its transition-to-transversion ratio
of 2.14 for positions matched in dbSNP, versus 2.86 for
unmatched positions, is probably a poor indicator of an
error rate in variant calling.
The Maq mapping software uses a base variation
(mutation) rate between reference and reads (the default
is 0.001) in its mapping algorithm. Further, Maq’s alignment scores are based on the probability of error in
mismatches between read and reference (details are in
[12]). Therefore, a true per-base variation rate for our
bison versus the taurine reference is likely higher than
that suggested by our percent of total differences given
by the alignment (0.45%, or about 5 per 1000 bases).
The relatively long evolutionary distance between the
bison’s genome and that of the taurine likely increases
the chance, compared with the reads for the two cows,
of the bison reads being incorrectly mapped. To test the
effect of the base variation rate on Maq analysis of the
bison reads, we re-mapped the reads after raising the
variation rate (using Maq’s mapping “-m” parameter)
from the default 1/1000 (0.001) used in our initial analysis to 0.002, 0.003 ... up to 0.007. While, against expectations, increasing the mutation rate was associated with
drops in the number of total differences called at our
depth/quality threshold (for heterozygous differences,
the largest drop was a loss of 40 calls at mutation rate
0.003, less than those called at 0.002), 95% of the 2,426

heterozygous SNPs called at rate 0.001 were shared by
all 7 mappings, and, including fixed differences, 99% of
single-base variants were called identically at all mutation rates. The high concordance suggests that, despite a
likely bias in mapping against divergent exon sequences,
there are bison exome sequences genome-wide among
our ~ 16,000 exons sufficiently similar to those in the
cow for identification of thousands of likely variant
bases (Table 1).
Sanger sequencing for verifying variant calls

Several exonic fragments from five genes (CSN3, LEP,
TICAM2, TLR2, and TLR4) were re-sequenced using
conventional Sanger sequencing, for verifying Maqbased variant calls. The primers were designed for
amplifying those exons with >150 base pairs, using Primer3 online Web interface (http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/primer3/). The primer sequences are provided in Table 3.
PCR reactions were performed in a 20 μl volume containing 10× PCR Buffer, 1.5 to 3 mM MgCl2 (upon primers), 0.2 mM dNTPs, 1 μM each primer, 0.4 U
Platinum ® Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen), and
approximately 30 ng genomic DNA. The PCR mixture
underwent 15 min at 94°C, 35 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 30
s at 58 to 64°C (upon primers), and 35 s at 72°C, and
final 10 min at 72°C on GeneAmp PCR System 9700
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,USA). PCR products were purified and sequenced for both strands, at
High-Throughput Genomics Unit (HTGU), Department
of Genome Sciences, University of Washington (http://
www.htseq.org/). Sequence trace files were checked and
aligned using software package DNASTAR v7.1 (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI, USA).
