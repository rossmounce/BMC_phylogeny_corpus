Abstract
Background: The sub-membranous skeleton of the ciliate Paramecium, the epiplasm, is composed
of hundreds of epiplasmic scales centered on basal bodies, and presents a complex set of proteins,
epiplasmins, which belong to a multigenic family. The repeated duplications observed in the P.
tetraurelia genome present an interesting model of the organization and evolution of a multigenic
family within a single cell.
Results: To study this multigenic family, we used phylogenetic, structural, and analytical
transcriptional approaches. The phylogenetic method defines 5 groups of epiplasmins in the
multigenic family. A refined analysis by Hydrophobic Cluster Analysis (HCA) identifies structural
characteristics of 51 epiplasmins, defining five separate groups, and three classes. Depending on the
sequential arrangement of their structural domains, the epiplasmins are defined as symmetric,
asymmetric or atypical. The EST data aid in this classification, in the identification of putative
regulating sequences such as TATA or CAAT boxes. When specific RNAi experiments were
conducted using sequences from either symmetric or asymmetric classes, phenotypes were drastic.
Local effects show either disrupted or ill-shaped epiplasmic scales. In either case, this results in
aborted cell division.
Using structural features, we show that 4 epiplasmins are also present in another ciliate,
Tetrahymena thermophila. Their affiliation with the distinctive structural groups of Paramecium
epiplasmins demonstrates an interspecific multigenic family.
Conclusion: The epiplasmin multigenic family illustrates the history of genomic duplication in
Paramecium. This study provides a framework which can guide functional analysis of epiplasmins,
the major components of the membrane skeleton in ciliates. We show that this set of proteins
handles an important developmental information in Paramecium since maintenance of epiplasm
organization is crucial for cell morphogenesis.

Background
Because of their asymmetrical and polarized cortical pattern, ciliated protozoans have long been interesting models for analysis of molecular mechanisms involved in
cellular morphogenesis. Paramecium is a prominent example of an extremely organized membrane complex. The
cortex is subdivided into hundreds of hexagonal cortical
units, which give the cell surface a honeycomb aspect.
Each unit is centered on a ciliary apparatus and encloses
an alveolar sac between the cell membrane and the
cytoskeletal material linked to the cytoplasmic face of the
inner alveolar membrane[1-3]. Just beneath this inner
membrane, lies a relatively thick and dense submembranous layer, the epiplasm, which surrounds basal bodies.
The epiplasm can be either continuous along the anterioposterior axis of the cell (e.g. Tetrahymena) or fragmented
into adjacent scales, forming the cortical unit framework
(e.g. Paramecium) [4]. To date, studies performed on the
membrane skeleton of Paramecium, mainly Paramecium
tetraurelia, were mostly descriptive, based on microscopic
and biochemical analyses. The components of this subalveolar cytoskeletal material were shown to be numerous, with similar biochemical properties [4,5] and an
antigenic heterogeneity at the level of epiplasmic scales
[6]. Recently, it was demonstrated that the membrane
skeleton of Paramecium is composed of similar proteins
encoded by a unique multigenic family, the epiplasmins
[7].
Given the rapidly increasing number of available organismic genomes, many potentially related sequences can be
compared, and thus more integrative studies are emerging
(for a recent review, see [8]). The P. tetraurelia genome has
been duplicated three times and retains many duplicated
sequences[9]. One of the major problems in analyzing a
multigenic family is distinguishing duplications due to
whole genome events from those resulting from segmental or single gene duplications. We here describe an
updated analysis of the epiplasmin family of the ciliate P.
tetraurelia, which regroups 51 proteins and attempt to correlate protein structure information obtained from
Hydrophobic Cluster Analysis (HCA) [10] with both gene
expression level and similarity tree analysis. Based on
DNA sequence alignment and distance computation, a
similarity tree groups the 51 epiplasmins in five main
clusters. HCA reveals that the majority of the epiplasmin
proteins obeys structural rules and can be represented as
successions of modular structural domains. The analysis
of the epiplasmin family of Tetrahymena, which comprises
four members, is performed in parallel. A structural comparison of proteins from the five main groups in Paramecium with the related proteins of Tetrahymena
demonstrates that they share the same global architecture,
with a conserved central domain flanked by specific
arrangements of common structural modules. In P. tetraurelia, according to the organization of the modules charac-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/125

terized by HCA, two symmetrical and asymmetrical
classes can be defined among the groups of the similarity
tree. Similarity and expression groups can further be correlated by regrouping epiplasmin genes according to the
presence of TATA-like boxes and USE elements in the
5'UTRs. Preliminary RNAi experiments were performed to
assess the biological significance of this classification.

Results
Updated phenogram of the epiplasmin multigenic family
After completion of sequencing and annotation of the P.
tetraurelia genome, 10 new related sequences (Epi 42 to
Epi 51) of the epiplasmin family were found (Table 1),
using a Blast search on the genomic bank (Paramecium DB
http://paramecium.cgm.cnrs-gif.fr/[11]) according to that
described in [7]. Similar Blast analyses were also performed on the recently released genome of another ciliate,
T. thermophila (Tetrahymena Genome Database (TGD)[12]
and two new sequences similar to P. tetraurelia epiplasmins were found, in addition to the two previously
described [7]. These sequences are noted as: EpiT n (1, 2,
3 and 5). A CLUSTALW co-alignment was done with the
51 DNA sequences of P. tetraurelia and the 4 sequences of
T. thermophila. Using the Phylip package, a similarity tree
was created. As described in a previous work [7], since
central domain of epiplasmins are conserved in EpiTs,
EpiT 5 was used as an outgroup (Figure 1). This analysis,
using the entire sequences, confirms the result previously
obtained with the co-alignment of the central domains of
the 41 previously identified epiplasmins, and completes
the description of this family. In addition to the four main
groups already described, a fifth group emerged including
the four small sequences Epi 48, Epi 49, Epi 50 and Epi
51. Each of these five groups can be sub-divided in two
sub-groups: a and b. Among groups 1, 2 and 3, each subgroup is composed of 6 closely related members which
conform to a 4+2 topology, with the exception of subgroup 2b which has only 5 members, and sub-group 3b
which has two additional orphan sequences. These
groups, which compose 75% of the epiplasmin
sequences, constitute a dense cluster clearly distant from
groups 4 and 5. For T. thermophila, except for EpiT 5 which
is closer to group 5, T. thermophila epiplasmins could not
be clearly linked to groups 1 to 4. This shows strong
sequence divergence between epiplasmins from the two
ciliates, despite conservation of the central domains.

Within the tree, nearly all epiplasmins are represented by
2 copies issued from the recent whole genome duplication (WGD), except for 5 orphan sequences: Epi 38, Epi
39, Epi 40 Epi 45 and Epi 47. In good agreement with the
tree topology, the gene relationships (Figure 1, red links)
inferred from a large scale synteny analysis[9], define paralogous sequences linked through several successive
nodes corresponding to at least three genome duplications. Nodes at the root of sub-groups 3a and 2b (Figure

Comparative analysis of P. tetraurelia and T. thermophila epiplasmins using DNA sequence alignment
Comparative analysis of P. tetraurelia and T. thermophila epiplasmins using DNA sequence alignment. Five
groups (1 to 5) were distinguished, based on node strength. According to hydrophobic cluster analysis, groups 1, 3 and 5
regroup 30 symmetric epiplasmins, group 2 represents 11 asymmetric epiplasmins, and group 4, 10 atypical epiplasmins.
Results of large scale synteny analysis are reported as a red strand over the tree topology. Nodes corresponding to the
'ancient' and the 'old' WGD are circled in red and blue, respectively. EST numbers are compiled for each sub-group.

1, blue circles) correspond to the 'old' WGD event defined
in[9]. The other sub-groups presenting the same topology
could be also associated to the 'old' WGD event even if
this is not supported by synteny analysis. Nodes separating these sub-groups (Figure 1, red circles) could relate to
a more ancient event not necessarily linked to a large scale
genome duplication.
Hydrophobic cluster analysis (HCA) of the epiplasmins
The previous analysis, based on sequence similarities,
grouped 75% of the epiplasmin sequences in a dense
crown composed of 6 sub-groups. This computed topol-

ogy does not yield relevant information on features specific to each of these groups. We used HCA to determine
the structural characteristics of each epiplasmin.
HCA is a powerful method to produce information using
graphical and bi-dimensional representation of proteins
[13]. The technique is useful to delineate protein
domains, and to predict structural properties. This
approach permits comparison of proteins which have
become widely divergent (less than 30% identity), and/or
proteins with large domain insertions or deletions. In
HCA protein comparison, one initially considers general

conservation of hydrophobic cluster shape, which can be
altered by substitution of non-hydrophobic residues in
place of hydrophobic residues. In this case, the behavior
of these non-hydrophobic residues is dependent on the
context of their 3-dimensional environment. In a mainly
hydrophobic region, residues such as A, S, T, C and even
Q behave as hydrophobic, and thus act as mimetic residues.
The recurrent presence of several clusters defines and
affirms the existence of a structural domain with conserved features, even when corresponding sequences
show less than 30% identity. Similarly, the determination
of conserved domains is not affected by insertions or deletions of any size. HCA comparison also permits the identification of invariant residue positions. Such topological
positions reinforce the overall similarity of clusters and
thus of structural domains.
The complete HCA representations of the 51 epiplasmin
proteins are presented as supplementary data [see additional file 1]. Analyses of these schematic representations
demonstrate specific domains within each epiplasmin.
For clarity, these data are presented according to Generalized Cluster Analysis (GCA) in Figure 2.
The HCA technique was initially based on the assumption
that clusters of hydrophobic residues can constitute the
internal core domain of a protein, thus minimizing interaction with solvent. HCA was later extended to GCA,
using the same approach but including clustering of 'loop
forming residues' with the propensity to interact with solvent. The combination of the two cluster types allows classification of proteins as modular assemblies of structural

domains. Figure 2 presents a sampling of the 51 epiplasmins that considers only one representative of the last
WGD, except for group 3b. In this case, genome duplication history for Epi 46, 47, and 7 is not in agreement with
their structural features. According to synteny analysis, Epi
46 and 7 are paralogs from the recent WGD. They present
however significant structural differences while Epi 46
and 47 are structurally strongly related. In order to illustrate the extended modularity of the epiplasmins, Epi 7
was chosen in place of Epi 47.
Characteristic features, as determined by HCA, are represented using GCA and the presentation highlights different structural domains in which hydrophobic, loop and
ambivalent clusters are represented in green, blue, and
yellow, respectively. The main feature characterizing these
proteins is a strongly structured central domain, which
begins with a short unstructured motif containing a serine/threonine phosphorylation site. On each side of the
central domain, the N- and C-term arms contain several
structural domains: i) a structured domain containing
repetitive PVQ rich motifs, ii) a hinge with a Ph [QSTR]Y
[AS] consensus indicative of beta turns or, simply, of a
transition between two domains, iii) a Y rich domain. Epiplasmins can thus be grouped by module similarities and
arrangement. This structural grouping matches the tree
topology obtained by comparison of aligned sequences,
including the partition of sub-groups a and b.
Most epiplasmins (41) present a sequential arrangement
of these structural domains, and can be classed as symmetric or asymmetric. In contrast, the 10 remaining epiplasmins (group 4) are characterized by an abrupt
transition on each side of their central domain, with two
rather unstructured (random coil) N-left and C-right terminal arms. These proteins constitute a separate atypical
class.
Among the symmetric epiplasmins, structural domains
are disposed as a mirror image on each side of the central
domain. The symmetric proteins of groups 1 and 3 have a
complete set of domains: one PVQ rich, a hinge, ending in
a Y rich domain. Proteins from these groups can be distinguished by major structural differences. In group 1, the
PVQ rich and Y rich domains are separated by only one
hinge sequence. However, in group 3, the hinge is duplicated 5 to 6-fold, and sometimes overlaps or tends to
mimic a PVQ rich domain (absent in sub-group 3a). In
addition, proteins from sub-groups 1a, 1b, 3a, 3b are distinguishable. Epiplasmins from sub-groups 1a and 1b differ in their Y-rich regions. In sub-group 1a, proteins
present clear harmonics (repetitive occurrences) of tyrosine residues while proteins of sub-group 1b present a
more disorganized pattern of tyrosine residues. Epiplasmins of sub-group 3a differ from those of sub-group 3b by

the absence of PVQ-rich regions. Group 5 proteins are
symmetric but less complex, with only the Y rich
sequences on both sides of the central domain.

The FLLF domain is not limited to asymmetric epiplasmins; it is found in some proteins of group 4 (Epi 3, 4, 8,
9, 40, 43, 44) which lack readable geometry.

In the asymmetric class, represented by the group 2,
sequential domain arrangement is conserved in the Nterm arm, whereas the C-term arm presents an alternative
domain. The hinge domain is followed by a rather
unstructured sequence ending in a very specific motif of
hydrophobic and aromatic residues, which constitutes a
conserved C-term FLLF cluster, defining a new domain
that we call 'FLLF' domain. Proteins of group 2a differ
from those of 2b by harmonic distribution of tyrosine residues in their Y-rich regions.

The HCA approach, by enabling the comparison of
sequences with large insertions or deletions, demonstrates
that epiplasmins are modular proteins.
Screening for proteins containing epiplasmic-related
domains
Refined analysis of the central domain common to all epiplasmins demonstrated that it is composed of seven
repeats
of
the
following
consensus
motif:
[ERK]xx[VILT]EY[VIY] (Figure 3A). This motif can also be

observed in the central domain of T. thermophila EpiT 1, 2,
3 and 5 (Figure 3A).
A BLAST search for this motif in the P. tetraurelia genome,
associated with an HCA analysis of each relevant result,
yielded a pair of paralogous proteins "Para 21655" and
"Para 23342". The core domains of these proteins contain
the first 4 of the 7 motifs. Screening of the T. thermophila
genome revealed a protein we called "Tetra 2829", with
the same 4-motif pattern (Figure 3A and 3B, and Table 1).
Although these T. thermophila proteins are quite divergent
from the P. tetraurelia epiplasmin family in their N and Cterm sequences, they present the same overall abundance
in P and Q residues.
The discovery in P. tetraurelia of two genes encoding for
proteins that share half of the epiplasmin central domain,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/125

and one in T. thermophila, reinforces the utility of cytoskeletal proteins as evolutionary markers, and thus requires a
closer examination of the relationship between EpiT proteins and the P. tetraurelia epiplasmin set.
Comparison of Paramecium epiplasmins with their
related proteins in Tetrahymena
The HCA approach was used to determine whether these
proteins also show a modular organization. In Figure 4,
we show structural comparison of EpiT 5, the smallest Tetrahymena protein, with Epi 51, one of the smallest group
5 epiplasmins. Both display an initial hydrophobic cluster
surrounded by specific conserved basic residues (R/K).
Downstream, successive clusters exhibit numerous Y residues and finish by a conserved group of S, R, T, P residues.
The overall distribution of hydrophobic clusters and conserved residue positions show that these two proteins

amino acids in relation with the hydrophobic clusters. This shows a spatial proximity between conserved proline and tyrosine
(as mentioned in the discussion).

share a similar structure. For the C-term part of the protein, a group of R, S, Y residues after the position 120 of
each protein was used as an anchoring (meaning "starting") point. This cluster is followed by a set of proline residues in Epi51 and a set of serine residues in EpiT 5. Both
serine and proline are structural breakers. A final Y rich
cluster is evident, with two topologically conserved
arginines. It thus appears that both epiplasmins are structurally similar and share symmetry, with a central domain
flanked by two Y rich domains.
In EpiT 3, compact hydrophobic clusters with a high content of aromatic residues are observed in the right arm of
the protein, as in the group 3 of epiplasmins in Paramecium. The residues at positions 160–174 in EpiT 3 are
identical to those of Epi 26. (These residues in a conserved
structure are termed topologic residues). Even if hinge
domain is not recognizable in EpiT 3, we can demonstrate
that both proteins end with a Y rich domain or more generally by an aromatic rich domain (in EpiT 3 Y residues are
often replaced by F residues). Epi 26 begins its N-term
with a peculiar hydrophobic cluster followed by 2 prolines. This constitutes an anchor for analysis which can be
found at position 13 of EpiT 3.
In both proteins a group of topologic residues (P, A, [I, L],
[R, K]) finishes the N-term domain. Between these two
reference points, the sequences share a PVQ rich stretch.
In EpiT 3, this cluster is between positions 20–40. In Epi
26, from 50–71. In EpiT 3 this PVQ rich domain is connected to the central region of the protein by a less structured stretch, while in Epi 26 this stretch is upstream of
the PVQ rich domain.
Despite the group 3 heterogeneity, this analysis of EpiT 3
indicates that this protein is structurally close to group 3
epiplasmins.
The affiliation of EpiT 2 and group 2 epiplasmins is more
evident. The typical alternative domain observed in asymmetric epiplasmins is present in EpiT 2 with the terminal
FLLF cluster. We chose Epi 5 as a representative of group 2
epiplasmins in Paramecium. At the N-term, these proteins
begin with an unstructured 20 amino-acids long sequence
followed by a hinge domain. A similar P, V, Q rich region
is evident, beginning with a group of topological residues
(P, Q, S, A) at position 40 and visible until the 80th position.
EpiT 1 harbors two PVQ rich domains flanking the conserved central domain. A repetitive occurrence of VQQ or
PVQ sequences is noticeable with an organization of
hydrophobic clusters. No FLLF domain is present, as previously observed for symmetric epiplasmins assigned to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/125

group 1. Epi 33 matches the distribution and shape of
EpiT1 hydrophobic clusters. Two terminal Y rich domains
are seen at both ends of the proteins.
This comparison of Paramecium and Tetrahymena epiplasmins shows the relation between groups 1, 2, 3, and 5 to
EpiT 1, 2, 3, and 5, respectively. HCA demonstrates the
clear similarity and geometric conservation of proteins
sharing less than 15% identity beyond the common central domain.
Expression and putative promoter elements
Taking advantage of the automatic annotation of the Paramecium genome, a compilation of the number of ESTs for
each of the 51 epiplasmins was performed (from file
http://paramecium.cgm.cnrs-gif.fr/download/fasta/
protein_info.txt), giving a probable estimate of their
expression rate (within a range of 0 to 72 EST).

In the partitioning of these 656 ESTs within the similarity
tree topology, a very uneven distribution between groups
and sub-groups is visible: over 71% of ESTs concern only
3 sub-groups: 1a, 2a, 3b (Figure 1). To determine if this
unequal partitioning of ESTs between sub-groups a and b
indicates a differential regulation of expression in Paramecium, we thus examined the 5'UTR of the corresponding genes.
The promoter region of ciliate genes remains poorly characterized. We sought specific promoter elements in
upstream regions of DNA sequences. The epiplasmin multigenic family gave us the opportunity to seek, in several
related genes, consensus motifs in the upstream regions.
The short macronuclear intergenic regions in Paramecium
facilitate the search for putative regulating sequences. The
5'-UTR of epiplasmin genes classified by the number of
reported ESTs, followed by respective group memberships, were then manually aligned to tentatively find conserved motifs.
As shown in Figure 5, most of the epiplasmin genes
present a common AT-rich stretch, 5 to 45 bp upstream of
the ATG with the main motif [AT]AAATAAA [AT] resembling a TATA-box element. When this motif is slightly
degenerated, it appears that nearly all genes (except Epi
36, 37, 48, and 49) present a putative TATA-box element.
An additional motif, 12 to 20 bp upstream of the TATAlike motif with a CA(1,3)TA(3,4) [AT]TTAT consensus is
seen. This upstream sequence element (USE), in the 10
first lines (green background), is present in sequences
from sub-groups 1a, 2a and 3b. These 10 sequences comprise 55% of ESTs seen in the entire set of epiplasmins.

5'UTR analysis of P. tetraurelia epiplasmin genes
5'UTR analysis of P. tetraurelia epiplasmin genes. The genes are regrouped according to EST numbers and presence of
USE and TATA-like elements. These motifs are shaded in blue for TATA-like element, and in green or yellow for the USE motif
according to whether it is located upstream or downstream from the TATA-like element, respectively.

This USE element (yellow background) can be found 3 to
5 residues downstream of the TATA-like box. As no corresponding sequence is associated with a high number of
ESTs, a 'misplacement' of the USE motif may abolish its
putative enhancer role. All members of sub-group 3a
share this misplacement and could act as a weak expression group. By contrast, genes of sub-group 3b do not
present a homogeneous regrouping of their 5'UTRs.
Epiplasm alteration by specific RNAi: Local and global
effects
Additional results of the analysis of the multigenic family
of epiplasmins using similarity tree, structural and transcriptomic approaches clearly demonstrate the importance of sub-groups 1a and 2a. They are structurally
homogeneous, representative of symmetric and asymmetric classes and account for 60% of reported ESTs. We thus
selected representatives of the family from these groups
for functional investigations.

We used the Epi 2 and Epi 41 sequences, of asymmetric
and symmetric classes, for which 32 and 69 ESTs were
found, respectively. RNAi was obtained by feeding Para-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/125

mecium with E. coli HT115 expressing the whole coding
sequence of Epi2 or Epi41 as dsRNA.
The RNAi time course was followed in vivo by light microscopy and by fluorescence microscopy after immunostaining, using the CTS32 antibody. This mAb recognizes
the whole set of epiplasmin proteins [4] and can be used
as an epiplasm marker. During the first hours, RNAi of
either Epi 2 or Epi 41 triggers an alteration of cell shape,
the loss of their slenderness: cells round up except at the
anterior pole, giving rise to pear shaped cells, a phenomenon also described for some actin RNAi experiments [14].
At the time of division, cytokinesis is impaired and cells
appear as "boomerang" shaped (Figure 6 Ba and Ca). Plasmodial forms accumulate 24 h to 48 h after feeding, due
to repetitive aborted divisions. Otherwise, RNAi of Epi 2
or Epi 41 does not affect cell viability. Ciliary movement
does not seem to be altered, as we have observed that cells
are able to feed on "Chinese" ink (data not shown). Swimming patterns seem normal, unless cell geometry is modified. Contractile vacuoles and gullets duplicate and
appear functional.

Immunofluorescence analysis using the CTS32 antibody
was used to see if this phenotype resulted in marked
reshuffling of epiplasmic material. Despite the severity of
the phenotype, observation of fixed cells immunostained
by CTS32 show no difference in the intensity of the fluorescent signal, or major relocalization of epiplasmic material within the cells. Unlike the unique global phenotype,
each Epi 2 and Epi 41 RNAi elicits specific local alterations
of this submembranous cytoskeletal component.
Epi 2 RNAi induces an alteration in the duplication of epiplasmic scales resulting in either unequally sized cortical
units or aberrantly oriented (antero-posterior) segmentation of the epiplasmic scales, leading to local doublings
along the kinetids (Figure 6Bb). In cells submitted to Epi
41 RNAi, CTS32 mAb decorates numerous nodules of epiplasmic material which appear between crenulated cortical units (Figure 6Cb).

classification in quite good agreement with the clustering
obtained with the similarity tree. The family can be
divided in 3 classes: symmetric, asymmetric and atypical.
The symmetric class comprises 30 proteins with structural
domains disposed in mirror image on each side of the
central domain. This class is composed of three groups,
groups 1, 3 and the more distantly related group 5. The
four epiplasmins from group 5 are the smallest of the family, having kept only a Y-rich domain on each side of their
central domain. The asymmetric class, group 2, has 11
members. These proteins retain the same structural
domain organization as the symmetrical proteins in their
N-term arm but their C-term region has lost the Y-rich
module. The atypical class, group 4, contains 10 proteins.
It differs from the two other classes in an absence of common modules in the N- and C-term regions but possesses
a FLLF domain in common with the asymmetric group.
This FLLF domain could likely be involved in specific
interactions within the epiplasmic structure.

Discussion
Agreement phylogeny/HCA
While not commonly used in phylogenetic studies, HCA
is useful in defining structural similarities between
sequences with low identity levels (<30%) and/or variations in inter-motif distance [15-17]. After the Paramecium
genome was sequenced, the multigenic epiplasmin family
was reevaluated as containing 51 members. As seen in figure 1, sequence information alone is not sufficient to infer
with success relationships between Tetrahymena and Paramecium representatives. Since protein structure is much
more evolutionarily conserved than sequence, the similarity tree based on co-alignment of the entire sequences was
compared to structural analysis of protein domains
obtained using the HCA method. A recent work by Silva
[18] uses an algorithm (based on an HCA representation
of proteins) intended to automatize a large scale databank
screening, defining TM-scores to select with a good probability a group of proteins sharing structural homology.
Proteins analyzed by Silva are mainly composed of globular domains. This analysis does not consider proteins
with extended helices such as coiled coil or proline helices. Such features can be found in epiplasmins. In the
present study, the use of HCA was to decipher domains
for comparison of proteins, in relation to the similarity
tree.

The combined results confirm the classification of these
51 epiplasmins in 5 groups. All the proteins share the
highly conserved central domain previously described [7],
which constitutes the signature of this family. While an
apparent variability can be seen in the flanking N- and Cterm sequences, it is possible through HCA to characterize
a set of various structural domains (PVQ-rich, Y-rich,
Hinge, FLLF-motif) which constitute the proteins. The different arrangements of these building blocks leads to a

Expression groups and genome evolution
According to the epiplasmin-specific ESTs retrieved from
Paramecium DB, nearly all members of the multigenic
family are expressed. Within this multigenic family, maintenance of genes during the successive genome duplications is in good agreement with expected behavior of
genes subject to dosage constraints (highly expressed
genes are preferentially retained as duplicates[9]). Most of
the sub-groups observed in the epiplasmin family have a
4+2 topology, a distribution also described for other sets
of highly expressed proteins: 35 cGMP-dependent protein
kinases [19], 26 syntaxins [20], 12 synaptobrevins [21]
and 17 vacuolar-proton-ATPases [22].

Regarding the distribution of the 656 ESTs retrieved from
Paramecium DB, one can see that gene expression levels
are not evenly scattered over the similarity tree topology.
It appears that nodes (Figure 1, red circles) separating the
five groups into sub-groups a and b insure not only a partition between expression groups, but also between
groups of genes which possess or lack recognizable motifs
within their 5'UTRs. These nodes could be associated with
an event of regulatory motif modification in the 5'UTR of
sub-group b genes. After duplication, Paramecium may
have maintained one of the genes and modified the 5'UTR
of another, providing the opportunity to neo-functionalize.
For example, proteins of sub-group 2a are structurally
identical; their genes possess both USE and TATA-like
motifs, and are highly expressed. Members of sub-group
2b also share evident structural identity, thus suggesting a
very similar function within the epiplasm, while none of
the genes 2b presents USE/TATA-like motifs in their
5'UTR. The large number of EST found in group 2a sug-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:125

gests that the epiplasmic protein function has an important (stoichiometric) need for asymmetric forms of
epiplasmin proteins. In contrast, group 2b may have been
maintained because they have diverged to perform a new
function that does not require that high levels of the protein be present.
Expression groups and putative promoter motifs
Other multigenic ubiquitous genes like actin or tubulin
have apparently undergone an extensive process of neofunctionalization[14,23]. For the epiplasmins, this process is not very evident, but the co-existence of sub-groups
possessing or lacking putative regulation elements could
constitute evidence of sub- or neo-functionalization. For
instance, highly expressed sub-groups 1a and 2a could be
used in a constitutive way all along the cell cycle, whereas
sub-groups 1b and 2b would be expressed only at a precise point in the cycle.

Three distinct types of region are thought to constitute
eukaryotic promoters: TATA boxes, CCAAT boxes and GC
boxes [24]. Although the sequence TATA [TA]A [TA] is the
consensus eukaryotic TATA element in most eukaryotes, it
has been demonstrated that most AT-rich sequences of 6
base pairs or longer can convey TATA activity in the proximity of other control elements. The promoter region of
ciliate genes is presently poorly characterized [25]. A study
of a set of homologous intergenic regions from 22 species
of Tetrahymena reveals a single putative promoter element,
with a consensus sequence TATCCAATTCARA. This
sequence contains a 'CCAAT' box, which also occurs at 8
locations preceding other ciliate genes and no 'TATA' box
was found [26]. Recently, the MTT2 gene of Tetrahymena
thermophila was shown to contain regulatory elements
such as a TATA-box, CAAT-box and several MRE-like and
ARE-like sequences [27]. In the ciliate Stylonychia lemnae,
the study of the α-tubulin minichromosome revealed a
TATA-like element, a putative initiator element and two
distinct upstream sequence elements (USEs) [28]. The
short 5' non-transcribed spacers between Paramecium
genes offer an extraordinary opportunity to study transcription initiation in these organisms. To date, in Paramecium, sequence comparisons have not identified highly
conserved promoter sequences but the presence of TATA
or CAAT boxes is suggested. We here provide an analysis
of the epiplasmin family on the presence of putative
TATA-like elements and upstream sequence elements
(USE) in relation with the expression levels of the corresponding gene products.
This analysis leads us to propose that an association of the
USE and TATA-like motifs could constitute a strong promoter region, since the ten sequences presenting this association represent only 1/5 of the 51 epiplasmins, but are
responsible for as much as 55% of the EST observed for
this family. The functional significance of these elements

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/125

is unknown, and this opens an interesting field in Ciliates
gene regulation.
Functional analysis by RNAi
RNAi experiments were conducted with representatives
from sub-groups 1a and 2a. Sequence homology, at the
23mer level, [see additional file 2] within these subgroups cannot preclude that RNAi conducted with of one
sequence also blocks the expression of the other genes in
the same sub-group: Epi 2 RNAi could block the expression of Epi 19 since this sequence has 10 common 23mers
with Epi 2; similarly, Epi 41 RNAi which could block the
expression of Epi 23 within the group 1a (23 common
23mers). In contrast to this non-selectivity of RNAi within
a sub-group, Epi 2 and 41 do not share any common
23mer; they were chosen for their inter-group selectivity.
The observed distinct local effects induced by the Epi 2
and Epi 41 RNAis show the group specificity of the triggered interference mechanism. These experiments suggest
that both symmetric and asymmetric classes of epiplasmins are required for proper epiplasmic scale formation.

Moreover, blocking expression of these epiplasmins,
although group specific, yields a common global cellular
response; a change in cell shape, followed by impaired cell
division and the appearance of 'monstrous' plasmodial
forms, without loss of viability as some experiments were
conducted for 2 weeks. This monstrous "pluricellular paramecium" resembled a plasmode. As development goes,
there is proliferation of individual organelles (contractile
vacuoles, gullets, nuclei) within one global plasma envelope, cohesiveness of these forms becomes too weak in
relation to the size of the plasmode. Then plasmode
explode under observation between slide and cover slip.
We were able to count at least 32 gullets, while 64 were
suspected but not demonstrated.
Abnormal or 'monstrous' phenotypes were described as
early as the turn of the past century, following merotomy
experiments [29], or chemical exposure to agents such as
an insecticide, benzene hydrochloride [30], or by x-rays
[31]. A similar phenotype, characterized by impaired cytokinesis and abnormal macronuclear division, was
reported after treatment of Paramecium by 6-DMAP, an
inhibitor of serine-threonine kinase activity [32]. These
phenotypes are probably due to the numerous phosphorylable molecules targeted by this drug. In regard to the
conservation of a potential serine-threonine kinase site in
the central domain of all epiplasmins [7], we could propose that these proteins are part of the many molecules
affected by the drug.
More recently, the use of RNAi, a supposedly more specific tool acting on one target protein, permits a less complex interpretation of phenotypes. Cytokinesis

impairment has been described in an exhaustive study of
the actin paralogs in Paramecium.
As cited in [33], cells expressing a construct GFP-act4 "did
not divide after microinjection and were too sensitive for
observation under the microscope". Moreover, the invalidation of the actin4 gene can lead to an altered cell division with the formation of a boomerang shaped cell. This
effect is sequence-specific as none of the RNAi with the
other 24 actin genes can trigger this phenotype. It is noteworthy that in the boomerang cells induced by actin4
RNAi, the exocytotic capacity is reduced to 10%, showing
the role of this actin4 in the docking process of the trichocysts to the membrane. It would be of interest to check
whether epiplasmin RNAi affects or not exocytosis since
both actin and epiplasmin experiments trigger an alteration localized at the cell surface. Considering the lack of
trichocyst anchoring observed from actin RNAi, the flattening of the epiplasmic scales observed from epiplasmin
RNAi, and the weakening of the cell resistance to deformation by pressure observed from both actin and epiplasmin
RNAi, it is likely that these various effects reflect an alteration of one cortical attribute: its tensegrity. We propose
that the integrity of the cortical tensegrity system is
required to keep and transmit a structural information
content 'coding' for a positional blueprint of cell division.
As epiplasmins form a major part of the cortex and are
involved in its integrity, they probably play a role in the
transmission of this type of 'epigenetic' information.
These proteins, previously identified by cell fractionation,
show in vitro reassembly in large fibrillar complexes [5].
Regarding the set of epiplasmin sequences, one could
search for potential protein-protein binding sites which
account for this copolymerization capacity. In the different domain arrangements within proteins from groups 1,
2, 3, and 5, searching for a minimal essential composition
required for epiplasmic function, one can see that PVQ
rich and hinge domains could be dispensable (group 3a,
group 5) while Y rich domains are present in all 41 proteins. The sequences corresponding to these domains
present an alternation between tyrosine and proline residues, with 2 prevalent motifs: P-X-Y and P-h-X-Y (with h
for hydrophobic residue). Even the 10 sequences from
group 4 present these motifs although no Y rich domain
can be identified. These proline rich regions (PRRs), albeit
not strictly organized in tandem repeats, have been
described as involved in protein-protein binding [34,35].
The PRRs (proline rich regions) have been described as
interacting with aromatic residues, as is the case for a PRR
from the 3BP-1 protein with the SH3 domain of the Src
protein kinase, which has a binding site lined with conserved tyrosine and tryptophan residues [35]. The PRR
proline-rich salivary protein has also been shown to interact with polyphenols (tannins) via proline residues [35].
The Y rich domains present in most of the epiplasmins
could provide them with a protein-protein binding capac-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/125

ity based on reciprocal inter-chain proline/tyrosine CH...π interactions[36]. Due to the permanent constraint
on the peptide backbone conformation of prolines, these
stretches could present more rigid segments having a
lower entropy loss upon binding. Repetition of several
alternated tyrosine and proline could be a way for increasing weak individual bindings, in much the same way as
additive H-bounds can stabilize double-strand DNA.
RNAi experiments in Paramecium demonstrate the crucial
importance of a functional epiplasm for the maintenance
of a normal development. HCA analysis of the two sets of
epiplasmins in Tetrahymena and Paramecium indicates that
both species harbor 4 to 5 main representative classes
composed of proteins having specific structural architectures. Such sets of proteins have not yet been discovered
in other ciliates. It is therefore not possible to determine if
these two ciliates share an epiplasmic set of protein issued
from a common ancestor or from functional convergence.
EpiT localization and function in Tetrahymena will bring
more information in order to evaluate the significance of
these proteins in cell morphogenesis.

Conclusion
In this report, the genome biology of two ciliates was studied using several independent methods. Paramecium
genome duplications offer the opportunity to examine the
divergence and functionalization of genes within a single
cell. The cell provides a simple evolutionary laboratory
and allows an internal control of tools used to compare
distant sequences. The simultaneous usage of phylogenetic algorithms and HCA aids in defining the organization of a multigenic family, here the epiplasmin family.
We now have a working framework for functional analysis. It addresses the presence of putative regulating
sequences for gene expression. From RNAi experiments it
demonstrates that epiplasmins are of critical importance
for cell morphogenesis. Last, it postulates that structural
diversity between epiplasmins would reflect various functions.
Our results enlarge the epiplasmin multigenic family
organization to another ciliate genus, Tetrahymena. The
distinctive identification and classification of epiplasmins
open the way towards a better-defined functional analysis
in Paramecium and Tetrahymena. It also opens questions
about cortical morphogenesis in these two ciliates.

DNA and amino-acid sequence analysis
Epiplasmin nucleic sequences [see additional file 3] were
aligned by the CLUSTALW (v1.8) program available at
http://clustalw.genome.jp, and processed through the
Phylip 3.6 package http://evolution.genetics.washing
ton.edu/phylip.html to build a similarity tree; distances
were calculated by DNADIST using the F84 model. Trees
were elaborated by the FITCH program using the FitchMargoliash method using the G (global) search parameter. Confidence levels were evaluated using 1000 bootstrap replicates and 10 jumbles for each replicate. The
rooted tree was drawn with Treeview v1.66 software, available at http://taxonomy.zoology.gla.ac.uk/rod/rod.html.
Hydrophobic cluster analysis (HCA) of epiplasmins was
performed according to [10]. Graphical representations
were obtained from the RPBS service at http://mob
yle.rpbs.univ-paris-diderot.fr/cgi-bin/por
tal.py?form=HCA. Generalized cluster analysis (GCA) was
used to discriminate the different structural domains
according to their propensity to form loops or alpha-helices, using a three-residue threshold for cluster validation,
a connectivity distance of four, and the hydrophobic and
loop alphabets described in [13].

PBS containing 1% BSA (PBSB). Slides were washed in
PBS and treated for one hour with goat anti-mouse IgG
FITC conjugated antibody (GAM-FITC, Sigma) diluted 1/
100 in PBSB. After three successive washes in PBS, cells
were mounted in Vectashield (Vector laboratories). RNAiinduced phenotypes were observed using a DMCR epifluorescence Leica microscope equipped with a Cohu high
performance CCD camera.

DNA cloning and sequencing
Epi 2 and Epi 41 sequences were amplified by PCR on
genomic DNA using specific primers: Epi2S: 5'-AATA AA

Epi 2, and Ep41N: 5' GCGGCGAATTCATGTCACAAAGACCACCCGTC 3' and Ep41R: 5' GCGGCGAATTCTCTGGGAGGTTATTATTAAAC 3' for Epi 41. Amplification
products were cloned in the Litmus 28i plasmid (New
England Biolabs) and transfected in competent HT115
bacteria designed for feeding-mediated RNAi [38]. Plasmid inserts were sequenced on both strands using Litmus
specific primers and the DTCS Quick Start Kit (Beckman
Coulter, France).

Additional material

Feeding-mediated RNAi
Feeding experiments were performed as described [38].
Negative controls fed P. tetraurelia with HT115 bacteria
transformed only with the Litmus plasmid.
Microscopy
Cells were permeabilized for 1 min using 1% Triton X-100
in PHEM buffer (Pipes 60 mM, Hepes 25 mM pH 6,9,
EGTA 10 mM, MgCl2 2 mM), then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PHEM buffer. Cells were washed in PBS
(0,15 M NaCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 2,5 mM NaH2PO4, pH
7,2) and incubated for 15 min in PBS containing 3% BSA
to prevent non-specific binding of antibodies. Primary
antibody, CTS32 [4]was applied for 1 h diluted 1/20 in

HCA representation of the 51 epiplasmins of P. tetraurelia. According
to their modular organization, these proteins can be regrouped in five
main groups 1 to 5. On each side of their common central domain, various
modules can be identified: PVQ rich, Hinge, Y rich domains, and FLLF
motif.

Additional file 2
Compilation of common 23 mers between epiplasmin genes. According
to RNAi knowledge, amplification of RNAi activity is mediated by the
presence of small 21 to 23 mers obtained by RdRp activity. In order to estimate co-silencing possibility, the number of common 23 mers between
each epiplasmin genes is presented in this table.
