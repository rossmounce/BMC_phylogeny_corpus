Abstract
Background: The Arthropods are a diverse group of organisms including Chelicerata (ticks, mites,
spiders), Crustacea (crabs, shrimps), and Insecta (flies, mosquitoes, beetles, silkworm). The cattle
tick, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus, is an economically significant ectoparasite of cattle affecting
cattle industries world wide. With the availability of sequence reads from the first Chelicerate
genome project (the Ixodes scapularis tick) and extensive R. microplus ESTs, we investigated evidence
for putative RNAi proteins and studied RNA interference in tick cell cultures and adult female ticks
targeting Drosophila homologues with known cell viability phenotype.
Results: We screened 13,643 R. microplus ESTs and I. scapularis genome reads to identify RNAi
related proteins in ticks. Our analysis identified 31 RNAi proteins including a putative tick Dicer,
RISC associated (Ago-2 and FMRp), RNA dependent RNA polymerase (EGO-1) and 23
homologues implicated in dsRNA uptake and processing. We selected 10 R. microplus ESTs with
>80% similarity to D. melanogaster proteins associated with cell viability for RNAi functional screens
in both BME26 R. microplus embryonic cells and female ticks in vivo. Only genes associated with
proteasomes had an effect on cell viability in vitro. In vivo RNAi showed that 9 genes had significant
effects either causing lethality or impairing egg laying.
Conclusion: We have identified key RNAi-related proteins in ticks and along with our loss-offunction studies support a functional RNAi pathway in R. microplus. Our preliminary studies indicate
that tick RNAi pathways may differ from that of other Arthropods such as insects.

Background
The understanding of gene function in a poorly studied
Arthropod such as the cattle tick Rhipicephalus (Boophilus)
microplus (subphylum Chelicerata: order Acari: suborder
Ixodida) can benefit from the knowledge generated by
genome-wide resources of the model insect Drosophila
melanogaster (subphylum Mandibulata: order Hexapoda:
suborder Insecta). The genome of the fruit fly D. melanogaster was among the first eukaryotic genomes to be
sequenced and assembled [1]. D. melanogaster and R.
microplus evolved from a common ancestor ca. 500 million years ago [2]. In comparison to the existing comprehensive genome resources for the fruit fly D. melanogaster,
the cattle tick genome resources are limited to approximately 45,000 EST sequences [3]. In addition, the tick
genome size of 7.1 Gbp [2] compared to the D. melanogaster of 139 Mbp [4] will likely delay the generation of
a complete R. microplus genome sequence [5]. A genome
project for the related tick species, Ixodes scapularis, with an
estimated genome size of 2.1 Gbp, is currently underway
[6]. Although there are many invertebrate genomes completed including worms, nematodes, beetle, wasp, honey
bee, flies, and mosquitoes http://www.genome.gov/, I.
scapularis will be the first Chelicerate:Arachnida genome
sequence available representing mites, ticks, scorpions
and spiders.
Among the many methods available for reverse genetic
studies, RNA interference (RNAi) has gained popularity
because of its demonstrated efficient post transcriptional
gene-silencing effects in plants, fungi, nematodes, flies
and cultured mammalians cells (reviewed by [7-11]).
RNA mediated gene silencing is a widely conserved mechanism in eukaryotes and can be categorized into two partially overlapping pathways, the RNAi pathway and the
microRNA (miRNA) pathway. The RNAi pathway is triggered by exogenous or endogenous dsRNAs that are recognized by Dicer RNase III proteins which 'dice' these
molecules into double-stranded small interfering RNAs
(siRNAs) of 21–23 nt in length [12]. A typical eukaryotic
Dicer consists of 2 helicase domains, a PAZ domain, 2
RNAse domains and a dsRNA-binding domain (dsRBD)
[12,13], however some variations in this domain structure
have been noted for insect Dicers [14]. D. melanogaster has
2 Dicer enzymes, Dcr-1 and Dcr-2 which are responsible
for miRNA and siRNA production respectively [15]. By
contrast most other animals contain a single Dicer that
generates both siRNAs and miRNAs.
The next phase in the RNAi pathway involves the loading
of siRNAs into RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs).
dsRNA binding motif proteins (dsRBM), such as D. melanogaster R2D2 and Caenorhabditiselegans Rde-4 help siRNAs to be loaded properly into silencing complexes
[16,17]. Using the siRNAs as a guide, RISCs find target

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/10/26

mRNAs and cleave them. Argonaute (Ago) family proteins
are the main components of silencing complexes, mediating target recognition and silencing [18-20]. Most organisms have multiple members of the Ago proteins, for
example both insect species D. melanogaster and Tribolium
castaneum (beetle) have 5, whereas C. elegans (nematode)
has 27 [14,21-25]. In Drosophila Ago-1 and Ago-2 are
known to be associated with RISC [21]. In C. elegans, the
primary siRNAs processed by Dicer can also trigger the
amplification of siRNAs through a RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase (RdRP) to produce secondary dsRNAs in a
two-step mechanism involving secondary Argonaute proteins [26-28]. This mechanism has not been demonstrated in other animals to date and is commonly found
in plants rather than animals.
An additional phenomenon identified in plants and C.
elegans is the systemic spread of RNAi from cell to cell
throughout the organism and its potential systemic transfer to subsequent generations through the germ-line [2931]. Proteins related to this phenomenon in C. elegans
include Sid-1, which encodes a multi-transmembrane
domain protein thought to act as a channel for dsRNA
uptake, and RNAi spreading defective proteins (Rsd-2,
Rsd-3 and Rsd-6) shown to be required for the systemic
RNAi response [32,33]. Originally, systemic RNAi was
thought to be unique to C. elegans in animals, however
preliminary evidence suggests that silkworm, honeybee,
wasp and beetle utilize a Sid-1-like (sil) protein not found
in mosquitoes or flies (reviewed by Tomoyasu et al [14]).
Furthermore, over 20 genes identified as necessary for
dsRNA uptake in Drosophila cultured cells have also been
identified in other insect species [14,34-36]. The specific
mechanisms associated with dsRNA uptake and systemic
RNAi in Arthropods including some insect species are
thus currently undefined.
Of the above described proteins associated with RNAi
pathways, only one RNAi tick protein has been identified
to date, a putative R. microplus Ago-2 [37]. RNAi pathways
in Arthropods other than fruit flies and mosquitoes are
beginning to demonstrate that there are evolutionary variations in these pathways with a higher level of divergence
within the Arthropoda than previously thought [14,3841]. Similarly, long dsRNAs have been successfully
applied in R. microplus [42] and other tick species (e.g.
Amblyomma, Ixodes, Haemaphysalis, and Dermacentor spp.)
for targeted gene knockdown to demonstrate the function
of tick-specific genes in various tick life stages, with some
studies producing evidence of systemic RNAi spread into
subsequent stages (reviewed by de la Fuente et al [37]).
With the advent of increasing Arthropod genome
resources, it may be feasible to identify more putative tick
homologues of essential RNAi pathway-associated proteins to better elucidate the tick RNAi mechanism.

Improving the understanding of the mechanisms used by
ticks for gene knockdown will assist to develop specific
tick RNA interference reagents and improved techniques
for gene functional studies.
In this study we provide evidence for the presence of RNAi
pathway associated proteins in R. microplus ESTs and I.
scapularis genome reads, including a tick homologue for
Dicer, Argonaute proteins, RdRP and proteins associated
with dsRNA uptake and processing, and thus propose a
putative tick RNAi pathway. We then determined whether
targeting genes in the cattle tick which are homologous to
D. melanogaster genes with known RNAi in vitro phenotypes [43] would similarly result in abnormal phenotypes.
We identified 10 candidate genes and conducted in vitro
and in vivo (female tick injections) RNAi loss-of-function
assays. Interestingly, only proteasomal genes impaired
tick cell viability in vitro, whilst 9 candidates impaired tick
egg and larval development in vivo.

Results
Evidence of putative RNAi pathway in R. microplus
Dicer
A Dicer homologue was not confirmed in R. microplus
however conserved domains commonly found in Dicer
proteins of higher eukaryotes were identified in the R.
microplus BmiGI2 EST database ([3](summarized in Additional File 1). A single R. microplus EST sequence
(TC9337) was identified as containing an ORF of 250
amino acids (aa) encoding a putative RNase III
(Pfam:PF00636) domain. The pairwise alignment of the
ORF with the amino acid sequence of C. elegans Dcr-1
[GenBank:NP_498761] showed 24% identity and an evalue of 8e-12 (Additional File 1).

A Dicer tick homologue with the expected domain structure for a eukaryotic Dicer was identified in I. scapularis in
a recently assembled supercontig [GenBank: DS643033]
from the Ixodes Genome Project (IGP) [6]. This supercontig represents a 350 kb region of the I. scapularis tick
genome and we identified a 22.3 kb genomic region containing a single gene that has 14 exons (the annotation
described here has been submitted to the IGP). The predicted I. scapularis Dicer protein is 1799aa long and has
31% similarity to the predicted Dicer-1 isoform 4 from
the dog Canis lupus familiaris [GenBank:XP_868526]. Furthermore, Figure 1a shows that the predicted I. scapularis
Dcr-1 homologue has the same domain composition as
its counterparts in D. melanogaster and C. elegans. The
identified I. scapularis Dicer homologue clusters with the
Dicer protein from the bovine Bos taurus (Figure 1b).
Argonaute proteins
The analysis of R. microplus ESTs and I. scapularis genome
reads identified putative tick homologues of D. mela-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/10/26

nogaster Argonaute-1 and 2 proteins in both species (Table
1, Figures 2 and 3).
Figure 2a summarizes the domain structure of the identified tick Ago-1 proteins. The cattle tick Argonaute-1 protein (Cat-Ago-1) is partially encoded by two ESTs (Figure
2a). TC13769 encodes an ORF of 352aa containing the
DUF1785 domain located from aa 162 to 213 and a PAZ
domain from aa 226 to 350. A pairwise alignment using
blastp showed 43% identity with the respective domains
of D. melanogaster Argonaute-1 protein. Another EST,
TC6448 encodes the putative Piwi domain of the Cat-Ago1 protein, which has 46% identity with the Piwi domain
of D. melanogaster Ago-1. The Piwi domain encoded in
TC6448 is located from aa 120 to 430. The I. scapularis
contig ABJB010128003.1 (Iscap-Ago-1) encodes an ORF
of 967aa containing all three known domains of Ago-1
proteins (Figure 2a). The PAZ domain of Iscap-Ago-1 has
41% and 47% similarity with the PAZ domains of DmelAgo-1 and Cat-Ago-1, respectively. Interestingly, the Piwi
domain of Iscap-Ago-1 shows a higher sequence similarity, being 52% and 57% identical to its counterpart in
Drosophila and cattle tick. Based on the multiple
sequence alignments of the DUF1785 and PAZ of the Argonaute-1 proteins a clustering of I. scapularis and R.
microplus is observed (Figure 2b). The second cluster consists of the sequences from the insect species T. castaneum
and D. melanogaster. The sequences of the Argonaute-1
proteins from C. elegans and B. taurus form two separate
outlying groups.
Figure 3a summarizes the domain structure of the identified tick Ago-2 proteins. TC8091 represents a putative cattle tick Argonaute-2 protein (Cat-Ago-2) encoding an ORF
of 269aa harboring the DUF1785 and PAZ domains
located from aa 81 to 134 and aa 135 to 269 (27% identity), respectively. The R. microplus Ago-2 homologue
TC984 (TC9244/TC16832, BmiGI2) identified by de la
Fuente et al [37] was also confirmed in our search and
appears to encode a Piwi domain. Interestingly, the pairwise alignment using blastp with both D. melanogaster
Argonaute proteins showed an overall identity of 42%
with Argonaute-1 and 39% with Argonaute-2. The I. scapularis contig ABJB010009424.1 (Iscap-Ago-2, Figure 3a)
encodes an ORF of 896aa consisting of a DUF1785
domain from aa 304 to 357, a PAZ domain from aa 358
to 498 and a Piwi domain located in the region from aa
640 to 896. Sequence comparison of the putative IscapAgo-2 with the Dmel-Ago-1 ([GenBank:NP_725341.1],
27%
identity)
and
Dmel-Ago-2
([GenBank:NP_730054.1], 41% identity) proteins revealed a
higher homology between Iscap-Ago-2 and Dmel-Ago-1,
nevertheless the predicted domain structure of this putative I. scapularis Argonaute was more similar to Dmel-Ago2 (Figure 3a). The phylogenetic tree of the Argonaute-2

and R. microplus sequences group together, the second
cluster consists of the Argonaute-2 proteins from D. melanogaster and T. castaneum, and in the third group the
sequences from C. elegans and B. taurus are clustered.
Systemic RNAi and dsRNA uptake/processing
Available R. microplus ESTs and I. scapularis genomic contigs were screened for homologous genes to C. elegans proteins involved in RNAi systemic spread (Rsd-2, Rsd-3, and
Rsd-6) and dsRNA uptake (Epn-1) (Table 1). We identified putative hits to Rsd-3 and Epn-1 in both R. microplus
and I. scapularis with 45% and 48% (Rsd-3) and 71% and
43% (Epn-1) identities, respectively. Screening for tick
homologues against the 30 D. melanogaster proteins
implicated in dsRNA uptake and processing [35] identi-

fied 14 and 16 homologues in R. microplus and I. scapularis, respectively, at varying levels of similarity for the 23
hits (22–91%). The highest similarity was observed with
dsRNA uptake homologues associated with vesicle mediated transport, intracellular transport, oogenesis, endosome transport and ATPase for both tick species (Table 1).
RISC components and RdRP
Similarity searches with the protein sequences of the putative RNA helicases Armitage and Rm62, involved in the
assembly of RISC, resulted in best hits on R. microplus
sequences TC9347 and TC14966 respectively but no
homologues of Spindle E were found (Table 1). Searches
using D. melanogaster protein sequences for FMRp and

domain was identified in the putative homologue which
either indicates that it is not a true TudorSN homologue
or that the consensus sequence is currently incomplete.
However, a recent GenBank submission indicates the
presence of a putative I. scapularis TudorSN identified
simultaneously with this study ([GenBank:EEC18716.1]
Ixodes scapularis Genome Project Consortium). The EGO1 protein from C. elegans has RNA-directed RNA polymerase (RdRP) activity and is associated with the C. elegans

spreads to subsequent tick stages by an unknown mechanism [42]. It is yet unconfirmed whether a SID-1 or Sil-1
homologue exist in ticks, however, it is feasible that RdRP
and associated proteins are involved in germ-line spread
similar to the C. elegans RdRP pathway [28]. Here we postulate the potential amplification of both trigger dsRNA
and secondary siRNAs through the involvement of a CatRdRP. A R. microplus Dicer was not identified, although a
homologue was identified in the I. scapularis genome
reads as described above. A definitive dsRNA binding protein (such as D. melanogaster R2D2 or C. elegans Rde-4)
potentially associated with Dicer was not found using the

Schematic representation of a putative tick RNAi pathway. Cattle tick homologues are indicated using a 'Cat' prefix
for proteins where Rhicipephalus (Boophilus) microplus homologues are identified in this study (GenBank Accessions are listed in
Additional File 6). The proposed activity of the Cat-RdRP (RNA dependent RNA polymerase, EGO1-like) is indicated as amplifying trigger dsRNA or cleaved siRNAs. Long dsRNAs are recruited to Dicer (putative tick Dicer identified in I. scapularis
genome reads) via a yet to be identified dsRNA Binding Protein. The RNA-Induced-Silencing Complex (RISC) includes a CatAgo-2 (Argonaute-2 homologue), tick TudorSN (I. scapularis tudor-staphylococcal nuclease – GenBank EEC18716.1) and a CatFmRp (representing the D. melanogaster orthologue of the fragile-X mental-retardation protein essential to RISC). Homologues
for a tick RNA unwinding protein and a vasa intronic gene (associated with RISC) were not identified. The schematic diagram
was partly adapted from Sontheimer 2005 [44] and was drawn using Solid Edge Version 20 (Siemens PLM Software, TX, USA).

current tick sequence resources. A confirmed tick Rde-1
was not identified but has been associated with the RdRP
pathway if present [25]. Dicer guides the siRNA to the
RISC structure which has been adapted from the Sontheimer RNAi published diagram [44]. The RISC structure
demonstrates homologues for a cattle tick Drosophila Fragile × protein (Cat-FMRp), tick TudorSN (Ixodes scapularis
Genome Project Consortium) and the Cat-Ago-2
described above [44-46]. Other proteins putatively associated with dsRNA uptake, systemic or germ-line RNAi
listed in Table 1 were not included in this diagram.
Selection of R. microplus conserved homologues for RNAi
gene silencing
To validate further a putative functional RNAi pathway in
R. microplus we conducted RNAi-mediated loss-of-function assays in vitro and in vivo. We first selected tick RNAi
targets based on their homology to Drosophila genes
known to display an RNAi phenotype [43]. Of the 438
Drosophila genes known to affect growth and viability, 40
were identified in the I. scapularis genome reads and 37 in
the R. microplus BmiGI2 database with 31 hits common
between the tick species (results not shown). These results
were based on blastn searches with an e-value cut-off of
<1e-10. To select the most conserved sequences for tick in
vitro studies, using high stringency searches (>80% identity, e-value <1e-50), 11 R. microplus ESTs were identified
in the BmiGI2 database as homologous to D. melanogaster
genes with RNAi phenotypes affecting growth and viability at z scores >3 [43] (Table 2). An additional 2 highly
conserved homologues were selected as negative controls,
one with a lower z score (Drosophila string of perls) and one
with a nil z score thus with a nil effect on cell culture
growth and viability (Drosophila Tat-binding protein-1),
Table 2. The putative function of these 13 R. microplus
ESTs were then assigned by retrieving the annotated InterPro domains of their Drosophila counterparts (Table 2).
Evaluation of the assigned functional information
revealed that 5 sequences putatively have a role in ribosome and protein synthesis (TC5762, TC9037, TC12306,
TC12372, TC12393), 4 in proteasome and ubiquitinylation (TC6372, TC9852, TC10417, TC13930), 3 in DNA
binding (TC6116, TC12182, TC9417), and one in energy
and metabolism (TC5823). The controls used were the
Drosophila string of perls (TC5762) and Tat-binding protein1 (TC13930) homologues respectively.

Although all primers for target amplification prior to RNA
transcription were designed by targeting conserved consensus regions as described in the methods, amplification
of TC5823 (energy and metabolism/ATP biosynthesis),
TC9417 (DNA binding) and TC12372 (ribosome and
protein synthesis) was inconsistent with poor yields
which were inadequate for RNA transcription (not
shown). dsRNAs were transcribed successfully for the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/10/26

remaining 10 target genes (8 high z scores, 2 controls)
used for RNAi experiments in cultured R. microplus BME26
cells and adult female ticks.
Gene silencing in cultured tick cells
None of the dsRNA treatments had significant effects on
tick cell viability (Figure 6a) compared to controls and
compared to z scores >3 as described for the same targets
in Drosophila cells (Table 2, [43]). However, TC6372
(Ubiquitin-63E homologue) knockdown demonstrated
the most severe effect on growth and viability (inverse z
score 2.1) (Figure 6), also confirmed by microscopic
examination of the cells (not shown). An additional 2 target genes (Rpt1 TC10417, and Tat-binding protein-1
TC13930) demonstrated a slight reduction on cell viability with z scores 0.8 and 1.0 respectively. It is feasible that
the TC13930 treatment may have had a stronger viability
phenotype if the knockdown had been more effective
(only 31% compared to other treatments ~>79%). Collectively the effects are less significant in tick cells than for
their Drosophila counterparts in Drosophila cells, these 3
treatments are all associated with proteins involved in
proteasome and ubiquitin function. Quantitative RT-PCR
analysis confirmed that all RNAi targeted genes resulted in
a substantial reduction of the corresponding target mRNA
(79.9 – 100%) except for TC13930 at 31% (Figure 6b).
Gene silencing in adult female ticks (reproduction
phenotype)
The same treatments were tested in live adult female ticks
to measure any in vivo effects of gene silencing on tick survivability, egg output and larval hatching. Eggs laid by
ticks from the control groups showed no obvious morphological changes (see Figure 7a for eggs from "no treatment" group). The average egg mass weight was 0.118 g
for the control dsRNA group, 0.134 for the tick actin
dsRNA group, 0.107 g for the PBS injection control group
and 0.128 g for the negative control group (nil injection).
Eggs from the control groups showed a normal embryonic
development time to larval hatching at 27 days. The larval
hatching rates for control treatments ranged between
62.0–69.8% (Table 3).

Ubiquitin-63E dsRNA treatment had the most significant
effect on adult tick survival (average 10 days, approximately 5 days less than the controls, Table 3). Eggs laid by
R. microplus females injected with dsRNA targeting genes
associated with ribosome/protein synthesis (TC5762/
string of perls; TC12306/Rpl-8; TC9037/Ribosomal protein
L11; TC9852/Proteasome 26S subunit; TC12393/Ribosomal
protein S13) and proteasome/ubiquitin (TC6372/Ubiquitin-63E) demonstrated the most lethal effect on tick reproduction with deformed egg morphology and no larvae
hatching (Table 3). RNAi targeting of TC12306 (Rpl-8)
and TC6372 (Ubiquitin-63E) generated the greatest reduc-

tions in average egg output, with Ubiquitin-63E (TC6372)
treated ticks again being significantly affected compared
with the controls (Table 3). Figures 7b and 7c show examples of phenotypic effects on embryo development due to
TC6372 (dehydrated in appearance, embryo not visible)
and TC12306 (embryo smaller in size) knockdown
respectively. Down-regulation of the TC13930/Tat-binding protein-1 also associated with proteasome/ubiquitin
function, impaired embryo development leading to a
poor larval hatching rate (0.4%). In contrast, another gene
associated with proteasome/ubiquitin (TC10417/rpt 1)
had no effect on egg development and hatching rates
compared with controls, although this target demon-

strated a decrease in cell viability in cell culture experiments above. The 2 ESTs associated with DNA binding
(TC6116 and TC12182/histone H3.3A) both induced
slower embryo development and reductions in egg hatching at 3.1% and 35.2% respectively. A single (sixth) tick
was harvested to confirm the relative reduction of transcript levels (% knockdown determined by qRT-PCR) for
both the adult ticks and eggs (where applicable) for each
Drosophila homologue treatment. All treatments except
TC9037 demonstrated high knockdown of transcripts in
adult tick viscera (≥ 94%), with knockdown also confirmed in eggs tested (≥ 76%). As the viscera from only
one tick per treatment was harvested for RT-qPCR, it is feaPage 13 of 21

sible that the TC9037 treatment on this single tick was not
delivered successfully, however, none of the 5 ticks
injected produced viable eggs indicating a knockdown
phenotype for the TC9037 treatment overall.
Thus 9 of the 10 Drosophila tick homologues demonstrated either a lethal effect on reproduction or a reduction
in larval hatching rates when using dsRNA targeted knock-

down in vivo. The significant effects associated with the
Ubiquitin-63E homologue TC6372 treatments correlates
with the highest z scores for the same target in Drosophila
cell viability out of the sub-set of targets used here (Table
2, [43]). Data from the FlyBase website http://flybase.org/
identified that in vivo studies involving dsRNA injection
into Drosophila embryos was lethal for both Rpt1 and
RpS13 (correlating to TC10417 and TC12393 above).
However, Rpt1 (TC10417) was the only treatment which
did not have an effect in vivo for ticks. Fly in vivo knockdown studies associated with the 8 of the remaining targets were not found.

Discussion
The lack of tick genome sequence resources has limited
the ability to mine for RNAi protein homologues however
research to date has suggested that ticks utilize a dsRNAmediated RNAi similar to that described in insects such as
flies and mosquitoes [47,48]. De la Fuente and colleagues
[37] postulated a model for tick dsRNA-mediated RNAi
following the identification of a putative Ago-2 protein in
the R. microplus EST database. Our results support the diagram represented in de la Fuente et al [37] demonstrating
evidence for putative tick Dicer, RISC associated proteins
and dsRNA uptake homologues, however we identified a
R. microplus EGO-1 homologue known to be implicated in
RNA-directed RNA polymerase activity previously not
identified in animals other than C. elegans. We also identified a Cat-Ago-2 at higher similarity than the tick homologue identified by de la Fuente et al [37] which exhibited
higher similarity to the Argonaute-1 protein of D. melanogaster in this study. This is the first comprehensive analysis of RNAi sequence domains for a tick species and for
the Chelicerate Arthropods.
Compared to the vast insect genome resources (flies, mosquitoes, beetle, silkworm, wasp – to name a few), there is
currently only one Chelicerate genome available with the I.
scapularis tick genome project nearing completion. To provide an evolutionary perspective to demonstrate relationships within the Ecdysozoan infraphylum it is important to
note that their common ancestors may have existed over 1
billion years ago [49]. Comparative genomics between
these phyla is in its infancy and pathways such as RNAi
interference and gene regulation to date have been based
on the fruit fly D. melanogaster as the model organism. As
differences between RNAi pathway mechanisms between
C. elegans and D. melanogaster are evident, it is thus feasible
that Chelicerates could also vary from insects albeit their
evolutionary distance is less (~500 million years) [2].
Indeed, definitive hits for the domains and proteins here

RNAi proteins matching homologues in diverse species
such as insects (beetle, silkworm, wasp), nematodes, and
mammals (data not shown).

While only a single Dicer protein is present in mammals
and in C. elegans, in D. melanogaster siRNAs and miRNAs
are produced by distinct Dicer enzymes [15]. In this study
we identified one putative tick Dicer in the I. scapularis
genome reads however evidence for more than one Dicer
cannot at this stage be confirmed. This I. scapularis Dicer
was found to be most similar to a Dicer-1 from a mammal. A R. microplus Dicer could not be confirmed, however
an I. scapularis homologue was also not previously identified using EST data alone. Our preliminary evidence
points to a 'single' tick Dicer with yet un-confirmed structure, though until complete tick genome resources are
available the presence of more than one Dicer cannot be
entirely dismissed.
The RISC structure contains the following essential proteins: D. melanogaster R2D2 or C. elegans Rde-4 [17], D.
melanogaster homologue of the Fragile × mental retardation protein (FMRP) dFXR [45], Vasa Intronic gene (VIG)
and a Tudor Staphylococcal nuclease [46,50]. We were
able to confirm the presence of putative tick FMRp but no
significant hits for TudorSN or VIG homologues and no
significant similarity to known RNA binding proteins
using the current tick resources. However, a concurrent
study has identified a putative I. scapularis TudorSN (GenBank, Ixodes scapularis Genome Project Consortium) yet to
be confirmed in R. microplus. The Argonaute (Ago) family
of proteins contains 2 distinct RNA-binding domains PAZ
and PIWI (PPD) required to bind the siRNA and to slice
the cognate RNA to be degraded, respectively and thus are
essential to RISC [51,52]. Our study confirmed the presence of tick Ago-1 and Ago-2 in the I. scapularis genome
reads and found evidence for a complete Ago-1 protein in
the R. microplus EST database. A R. microplus sequence containing a partial Ago-2 protein was also identified. The
functions of these tick Argonaute proteins remains to be
confirmed and further research is required to identify the
full complement of tick PPD proteins.
Flies and mosquitoes do not possess C. elegans Sid-1
homologues known to be responsible for systemic and
germ-line RNAi. Tick RNAi observed in this study and the
literature demonstrate that a systemic RNAi silencing
mechanism is active in ticks [42]. Although a tick Sid-1
was not found, we did however identify a tick homologue
of the C. elegans EGO-1, an RNA dependent RNA
polymerase (RdRP) known to amplify trigger dsRNA
(transitive RNAi) and systemic RNAi [27,53]. RdRP is otherwise absent in flies, mosquitoes and other animals. Perhaps an RdRP-based RNAi amplification mechanism
within the Ecdysozoans (including ticks and C. elegans) is
common, but lost in insect species? Mechanisms for cell
to cell dsRNA uptake within ticks requires further investigation, as well as the confirmation of the activity of the
tick RdRP and Rsd-3 homologues identified here. Further
research to identify putative tick secondary Argonautes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/10/26

associated with the transitive RNAi pathway in C. elegans
is also warranted. These mechanisms have not been studied in spiders, mites or ticks to date, thus confirmation of
RNAi mechanisms within the Cheliceromorpha will assist
to confirm potentially new evolutionary mechanisms previously not defined and which cannot be based on pathways observed in insect species.
An additional aim of our study was to investigate whether
fruit fly RNAi screens of conserved genes could be associated with similar tick phenotypes and tick gene function.
We used a stringent search to enable the selection of the
most similar sequences to maximize the probability of
selecting a tick sequence which following dsRNA mediated knockdown could also affect growth and viability in
vitro. With the exception of proteasome/ubiquitin protein
homologues, the RNAi experiments with cultured R.
microplus BME26 cells did not replicate the effects
observed by Boutros and co-workers in D. melanogaster
cells [43] for all targets. However, in vivo knockdown confirmed a lethal effect for 6 of the 10 targets, with only one
demonstrating nil effects on tick reproduction. The ubiquitin-63E homologue which demonstrated the highest z
score and impact on Drosophila cell viability exhibited the
strongest effects on viability in our tick study both in vitro
and in vivo. However the effects on tick cell growth and
viability from the remaining 9 (including 2 negative controls) dsRNA targets tested did not correlate well with Drosophila demonstrating poor statistical significance at least
under our in vitro conditions. Kurtti et al [54] found that
cationic lipid-based reagents greatly improved the transfection of I. scapularis cultured tick cells as well as subsequent silencing of transgenes by dsRNAi. Perhaps uptake
of nucleic acids by cultured tick cells is less efficient than
with Drosophila cells. In addition, although tick genome
resources are currently incomplete, we did not identify
tick homologues of Scavenger receptors (Eater and SrCI)
known to be required for dsRNA uptake in Drosophila cell
culture [36]. This suggests the recruitment of different
receptors for dsRNA uptake in tick cells compared to those
described in Drosophila.
It is also possible that the cell line types utilized in D. melanogaster and R. microplus are not directly comparable and
functionally different. The 438 genes targeted by Boutros
and co-workers [43] compared the effects using 2 embryonic cell lines, Kc167 which is an 'early' embryonic cell
line and S2R+ which is a 'late' embryonic cell line – potentially more comparable to BME26 cells which are 'late'
embryonic in origin [55-57]. However, the BME26 average cell size is smaller at 15–20 μM compared to SR2+
cells at 50 μM [56,58]. The BME26 cell line also has a doubling time of 7 days, considerably slower than the Drosophila cell lines. Our in vivo studies were more convincing
demonstrating lethal and inhibitory effects on tick reproduction for 9 (including the 2 controls) of the 10 targets.

BMC Molecular Biology 2009, 10:26

In vivo studies in C. elegans showed that 47% of the C. elegans orthologues of the 438 genes associated with the Drosophila RNAi phenotypes exhibited developmental
phenotypes [43,59]. Perhaps the fact that we chose highly
conserved homologues increased the probability of success in our in vivo experiments compared with C. elegans.
However, it is clear that tick in vitro RNAi analysis using
BME26 cannot be directly correlated to available Drosophila in vitro data, unless perhaps only target genes with
higher z scores (as demonstrated here for ubiquitin-63E)
can be studied to increase the probability of a phenotype
correlation.
The challenges encountered during the initial PCR amplification of tick template DNA (results not shown)
prompted re-design of conserved primer sets for targets
amplified and transcribed in this study. Other tick dsRNA
studies have used cDNA clones [42] as templates for
amplification and subsequent transcription verifying that
perhaps the tick genomic DNA templates are not amenable for high throughput gene amplification required for
RNAi functional screens. The tick genome is large (7.1
Gbp) with a high ratio of repetitive and exonic sequences
[2] also confirmed here with the I. scapularis putative
Dicer genomic sequence structure with 14 exons. The
presence of complex intronic/exonic structure can inhibit
satisfactory PCR amplification of gDNA possibly due to
poor primer binding. This was mostly overcome in this
study by improving primers by targeting conserved ORFs
across several arthropod species, however, amplification
was not always consistent (not shown). It may be feasible
to develop short interfering RNA treatments which would
be simpler to prepare than long dsRNA treatments for difficult templates such as the tick, to date siRNAs have not
been applied in R. microplus loss-off-function assays. Long
dsRNA gene silencing can also lead to off target effects and
false positive RNAi phenotypes [60,61]. Until complete
annotated tick genome resources are available, false positive knockdown resulting from long dsRNA treatments
and the specificity of (siRNAs) tick RNAi reagents cannot
be confirmed.

Conclusion
We utilized the existing R. microplus BmiGI2 database
(13,643 ESTs) and the I. scapularis genome reads to identify 31 putative tick RNAi proteins which confirmed the
presence of a putative Dicer, RISC associated, dsRNA
uptake and RdRP proteins in ticks and constructed a putative tick RNAi pathway. Apart for proteasome/ubiquitinylation homologues, it was not feasible to replicate D.
melanogaster embryonic cell culture RNAi functional data
in R. microplus BME26 embryonic cells. This could either
be attributed to transfection/uptake issues and/or a difference in cell types in the fly and tick embryonic cell lines.
We did demonstrate a correlating in vivo effect on embryogenesis for 9 of the 10 D. melanogaster tick homologues.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/10/26

The findings in this manuscript support the fact that perhaps the Chelicerates may not be amenable to modeling
based on insect pathways (Subphylum Mandibulata) as
perhaps expected for Arthropods. With the evidence of a
tick RdRP and the propensity for systemic or germ-line
RNAi, it will be better to compare gene function and RNAi
pathways between members of the Arachnida and the
Superphylum Nemathelminthes (C. elegans). Until more
tick and related genomes (mites and spiders) are available, such comparative studies within these Subphyla are
not feasible. Clearly the RNAi pathways warrant further
elucidation, and tick specific genome and functional data
will be beneficial for tick research and for the development of improved tick control measures.

Key RNAi pathway-associated proteins from D. melanogaster
and
C.

described
previously
[28,32,35,36,45,46,50,73,74] were screened against the
available tick ESTs (BmiGI2) [3] and I. scapularis genome
contig reads obtained from the NCBI whole genome project
database (project ID 16233) using BLAST [62]. For the
BLAST searches an initial e-value of <1e-05 was set as a
threshold. The best hits from the R. microplus and I. scapularis
sequences where then used as query sequences in a second
round of BLAST searches against the D. melanogaster and C.
elegans subsets of the NCBI non-redundant protein database.
Results of this reciprocal BLAST search validated the
sequence similarity between the key RNAi pathway-associated proteins from D. melanogaster and C. elegans and the two
ixodid tick species, sequences which did not return the corresponding RNAi protein were subsequently disregarded. Further confirmation was obtained by performing searches
against the InterPro database using InterProScan (data not
shown) [63]. All searches were performed with the BLAST
default settings. Specific approaches for Dicer, Argonautes
and RdRP homologues are described below.

Dicer domains
Multiple sequence alignments for the domains typical for
proteins of the Dicer family were retrieved from the Pfam
website. Specifically these were the alignments for the
Helicase conserved C terminal domain (Pfam:PF00271),
double-stranded RNA binding domain (Pfam:PF03368),
PAZ domain (Pfam:PF02170), RNase3 domain
(Pfam:PF00636), and the double-stranded RNA binding
motif (Pfam:PF00035). Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)
were constructed locally using hmmbuild of the
HMMER2 package [64] with default settings. The programs estwisedb and genewisedb of the Wise2 package
[65] were used to perform searches with each HMM as a
query in a local copy of the BmiGI2 database and the I.
scapularis sequences obtained from NCBI whole genome
sequencing projects. The best hit sequences from these
searches were retrieved from the respective databases and
a conceptual translation of encoded open reading frames
(ORFs) was performed using the program getorf, part of
the EMBOSS package of computational biology tools. The
ORFs were then used as the query sequence for a blastp
search against the NCBI Reference Sequence protein database to verify the validity of the initial search results. Further confirmation of the search results was achieved by
screening the ORFs against the Pfam database using the
global search model.

For the prediction of gene models and the identification of
the exon/intron structure, the program genewise from the
Wise2 package was used to map the detected ORFs to the
genomic sequences. I. scapularis expressed sequence tags
from the I. scapularis ISGI2 database were used in blastn
searches to verify the validity of the predicted exon/intron
structure by genewise. The sequences of the ORFs were also
screened against a local copy of the Pfam database using the
program hmmpfam of the HMMER2 package to reveal the
sequence structure of the conserved domains.
Argonaute domains
Multiple sequence alignments of amino acid sequences
stored in the Pfam database were obtained for following protein domains and domain families: Domain of unknown
function (DUF)1785 (Pfam:PF08699), PAZ domain
(Pfam:PF02170) and Piwi (Pfam:PF02171). HMMs were
built from the multiple sequence alignments using the program hmmbuild with default settings. The BmiGI2 database
and I. scapularis sequences were searched with the programs
estwisedb and genewisedb using the HMMs as query
sequences. The program getorf was used to conceptually
translate the ORFs of the best hits. The validity of the initial
search results was verified by blastp searches against the
NCBI Reference Sequence protein database. Further confirmation of the search results was achieved by screening the
ORFs against the Pfam database using the global search
model. A comparison between known Argonaute proteins
from D. melanogaster and C. elegans was performed using the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/10/26

program bl2seq, which uses the BLAST algorithm for a pairwise comparison.
Phylogenetic analysis of Dicer, Argonaute and RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase proteins
Multiple sequence alignments of the protein sequences and
ORFs were performed using Clustalw [66] with default program settings. In addition to the Dicer sequences illustrated
in Figure 1a, following protein sequences were included in
the construction of the phylogenetic tree (Figure 1b): Bos
taurus Dicer-1 [GenBank:NP_976235.1] and T. castaneum
Dicer-2 [GenBank:NP_001107840.1]. The phylogenetic
trees (Figures 2b and 3b) for Argonaute-1 and Argonaute-2
were constructed using additional sequences from C. eleand
[Gengans
[GenBank:NP_510322.2]
T.
castaneum
Bank:NP_871992.1],
and
[GenBank:
[GenBank:XP_971295.2]
NP_001107842.1] and B. taurus [GenBank:NP_991363.1]
and [GenBank:AAS21301.1]. For both Argonaute-1 and 2
proteins, the phylogenetic trees were based on the alignments of the DUF1785 and PAZ domains. The phylogenetic tree (Figure 4) for the partial R. microplus RdRP protein
(Cat-RdRP) was constructed using additional RdRP
domain (Pfam:05183) sequences from the metazoans: C.
elegans (Ego-1 [GenBank:NP_492132.1], rrf-1 [GenBank:NP_492131.1] and rrf-3 [GenBank:NP_495713.1])
and I. scapularis ([GenBank:EEC04985.1], [Gen[GenBank:EEC12509.1],
[GenBank:EEC05952.1],
Bank:EEC12909.1]); plants: Arabidopsis thaliana [GenBank:
NP_172932], Hordeum vulgare [GenBank:ACH53360.1],
Nicotiana tabacum [GenBank:CAR47810.1], and Solanum
lycopersicum [GenBank:ABI34311.1]; fungi: Aspergillus fumigatus [GenBank:EDP48577.1], Neurospora crassa [GenBank:XP_964248.2] and Schizosaccharomyces pombe
[GenBank:NP_593295.1]; and protists: Dictyostelium discoideum [GenBank:XP_636093.1] and Tetrahymena thermophila [GenBank:XP_001026321.1]. The conserved RdRP
domains were extracted from these sequences and then
used for the alignment to the partial R. microplus RdRP
domain. The multiple sequence alignments for all 3 studied proteins were visually inspected and the phylogenetic
trees were constructed using Geneious 3.8.5 http://
www.geneious.com, last accessed on 12/08/08). Pairwise
distances were calculated based on the BLOSUM62 matrix
and the respective trees were constructed using NeighborJoining. No outgroups were selected and the consensus
trees were built using bootstrapping with 5,000 samples.
Identification of R. microplus homologues for known
Drosophila RNAi viability phenotypes
Raw experimental results of the genome wide RNAi screen
of D. melanogaster are publicly available at the website
http://www.flyrnai.org[67]. The gene ontology data for
the identified RNAi targets were retrieved from http://
www.flybase.org[4]. Genes of interest were selected based
upon a phenotypic z score > 3 [43]. For these genes, corPage 17 of 21

responding translations were retrieved from FlyBase and
used for the subsequent amino acid similarity searches.
The D. melanogaster cDNA sequences from the selected
RNAi targets were used to screen to search the 13,643 of
the R. microplus ESTs and TCs for highly conserved genes
using blastn [62]. Sequences with a similarity of at least
80% and an e-value less than e1-50 were selected, conceptually translated and their putative function was further
analyzed by assigning GO terms using InterProScan
[63,68,69]. Additional Files 2 and 3 describe this selection
process and the GO terms utilized respectively.
Tick cell culture and sources of ticks for dsRNA treatment
studies
BME26 was derived in 1985 from R. microplus embryonated eggs in the USA [57] and supplied by Dr. Munderloh (Department of Entomology, University of
Minnesota, St. Paul, Minnesota 55108) to the Queensland Department of Primary Industries & Fisheries in Australia. Cell culture protocols to maintain and passage the
cell line (obtained at passage 55) have been previously
described [70]. N strain adult female ticks were obtained
from the DPI&F Animal Research Institute tick cell colony
[71].
DNA and RNA extraction methods
DNA from BME26 cells was prepared using the QIAamp
DNA mini kit (QIAGEN Sciences, MD, USA) – protocol
for cultured cells as described by the manufacturer. RNA
for qRT-PCR analysis prepared from BME26 cells, adult
tick viscera, and tick eggs was extracted using TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's
instructions. For RNA extractions from larvae, the larvae
were first ground in liquid nitrogen using a mortar and
pestle prior to TRIzol® reagent extraction following the
manufacturer's instruction (Invitrogen, CA, USA).
dsRNA synthesis methods
Sequences from Anopheles gambiae, D. melanogaster, I.
scapularis, and R. microplus (Additional File 4) were
aligned using AlignX (Invitrogen Vector NTI, CA, USA) to
identify conserved regions for primer design. Primers were
subsequently designed using Invitrogen Vector NTI to
amplify the corresponding conserved region in R. microplus (Additional File 5). T7 promoter sequences were
added to the 5'-ends of the primers to allow for subsequent RNA transcription as described in the manufacturer's instructions (Ambion MEGAScript RNAi kit,
Applied Biosystems, CA, USA). PCR products were amplified from 20 ng DNA prepared from BME26 cells as template using 10 pM each primer, 10 pmol dNTPs, HotStart
Taq Plus enzyme and the buffer provided by the manufacturer (QIAGEN Sciences, MD, USA) in a 20 μl reaction
volume. The optimal annealing temperature for each
assay was determined using gradient PCR and a temperature gradient of 55°C to 70°C in twelve discrete steps in a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/10/26

G-storm GS-1 thermocycler (Geneworks Technologies Pty
Ltd, SA, Australia). The PCR thermal profile was as follows: 95°C 2 min, followed by 35 cycles at 95°C 10s,
annealing temp 30s, 72°C 1 min (annealing temperatures
for each primer pair described in Additional File 5), and a
final extension at 72°C 7 min. The size of the PCR products (Additional File 5) were confirmed by gel electrophoresis using 1.5% Agarose in TAE Buffer (Tris acetate 40
mM, EDTA 2 mM, pH 8.5) after 45 minutes at 90 V. The
PCR products were purified using the QIAquick kit (QIAGEN Sciences, MD, USA) following the manufacturer's
protocol. Long dsRNA were synthesized from the purified
PCR products (5 pooled 20 μl reactions per gene target)
using the MEGAScript RNAi kit as described by the manufacturer (Ambion, Applied Biosystems, CA, USA). Purified
dsRNAs were stored in elution buffer at -70°C until further use. Actin (TC12168) and the dsRNA control supplied by the manufacturer (MEGAScript, Ambion,
Applied Biosystems, CA, USA) were prepared as tick specific and non-specific dsRNA treatments, respectively.
Transfection of BME26 tick cells
In vitro transfection methods for the dsRNA treatment of
tick cells were modified from D. melanogaster methods
originally described by Boutros et al [43]. BME26 cells at
passage 57 were grown in 96-well plates freshly seeded
with 48,000 cells/40 μl per well. Cells were transfected
with 800 ng dsRNA and incubated at 31°C for 60 mins
prior to the addition of complete medium (final total well
volume of 120 μl). Treatments were incubated for 4 days
at 31°C and each well was supplemented with 80 μl complete medium at Day 2. Each treatment contained 6 replicates to provide 3 replicates for viability assay and 3 for
qRT-PCR. On Day 4 (96 hrs post treatment), 3 wells were
subjected to cell viability testing using the Cell Glow kit as
per manufacturer's instructions (Promega Corporation,
WI, USA) and 3 wells were subject to RNA extraction for
qRT-PCR screening. Controls included nil treatment
(media only) and the dsRNA control from the Ambion
MEGAScript RNAi kit (non-specific dsRNA treatment).
Impairment of growth and viability relative to the nil
treatment control was statistically determined by calculating inverse z-scores for every treatment [43].
Injection of R. microplus ticks with dsRNA, monitoring
and statistical analysis of mortality and egg output
Female adult ticks fed to repletion were collected within
24 hrs from dropping from the bovine host for dsRNA
injection. Six ticks per treatment (10 Drosophila homologues, no injection control, PBS injection control, tick
actin dsRNA and the MEGAScript dsRNA control) were
injected with 1–2 × 1012 dsRNA molecules using a microinjector (World Precision Instruments Inc., Florida, USA)
as described previously by Nijhof and colleagues [42],
except ticks were first pierced using a 30 G needle rather
than 27 G. Five out of the 6 ticks per treatment were monPage 18 of 21

itored daily for effects on mortality, egg output and larval
hatching rates until all ticks had died [42]. Statistical analyses were conducted using GenStat 10 (VSN International). The following variables were subjected to analysis
of variance assessing the effect of replicates and treatments: 1. total wt of eggs produced; 2. days ticks survived
post injection; 3. days from laying to larval hatch; and 4.
percent larvae hatched. A protected least significant difference (LSD) procedure was used to compare treatment
means using a significance level of 0.05. RNA was
extracted from the viscera and from the eggs collected
from the 6th replicate tick per treatment for qRT-PCR analysis on days 6 and 14 respectively (see below).

Quantitative RT-PCR gene expression analysis
Primer sequences, PCR product and annealing temperatures for all targets are described in Additional File 5.
cDNA was synthesized using a cDNA synthesis kit (Bioline International, London, UK), and triplicate qPCRs (50
ng per reaction) of BME26 cells was undertaken using
SensiMixPlus SYBR kit (Quantace Ltd, Watford, UK) in
the Corbett RotorGene 3000 (Corbett, Sydney, Australia)
using the following profile: 95°C 10 mins; 40 cycles of
95°C 15 s, 55°C 30 s, 72°C 30 sec, followed by a melt
analysis 72–90°C 30 s on the first step, 5 s holds for subsequent steps, according to manufacturer's instructions
for SYBR green detection. All the results corresponded to
relative quantification using R. microplus actin (Additional
File 5) as an internal control gene using the 2-ΔΔCt method
[72].

MRV conducted the qRT-PCR experiments and authored
the corresponding sections.

Viscera from the 6th replicate tick of each Drosophila
homologue group were homogenized in TRIzol® to extract
total RNA. The semi quantitative analysis of the samples
was undertaken using the QuantiTect SYBR green RT-PCR
Kit® (QIAGEN, Australia) as recommended by the manufacturer. The expression profiles were normalised against
R. microplus actin as above. Reactions contained 125 ng of
total RNA, 12.5 μl of 2× QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR
Master mix, 10 pmol of each primer, 0.25 μl QuantiTect
RT Mix, the final reaction volume was 25 μl. RT-PCR reaction were conducted on Rotor-Gene 3000 under the following conditions: reverse transcription 50°C for 30 min,
PCR initial activation at 95°C for 15 min, followed by 40
cycles at 94°C, 15 s, 55°C, 30 s and 72°C 30 s. Calculation of percent gene expression and knockdown (average
of 3 triplicate reactions) was determined by comparative
CT method for relative quantification as described above.
