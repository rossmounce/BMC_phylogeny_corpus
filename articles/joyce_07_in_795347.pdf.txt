Abstract
Background: Subtypes of the GABAA receptor subunit exhibit diverse temporal and spatial
expression patterns. In silico comparative analysis was used to predict transcriptional regulatory
features in individual mammalian GABAA receptor subunit genes, and to identify potential
transcriptional regulatory components involved in the coordinate regulation of the GABAA
receptor gene clusters.
Results: Previously unreported putative promoters were identified for the β2, γ1, γ3, ε, θ and π
subunit genes. Putative core elements and proximal transcriptional factors were identified within
these predicted promoters, and within the experimentally determined promoters of other subunit
genes. Conserved intergenic regions of sequence in the mammalian GABAA receptor gene cluster
comprising the α1, β2, γ2 and α6 subunits were identified as potential long range transcriptional
regulatory components involved in the coordinate regulation of these genes. A region of predicted
DNase I hypersensitive sites within the cluster may contain transcriptional regulatory features
coordinating gene expression. A novel model is proposed for the coordinate control of the gene
cluster and parallel expression of the α1 and β2 subunits, based upon the selective action of
putative Scaffold/Matrix Attachment Regions (S/MARs).
Conclusion: The putative regulatory features identified by genomic analysis of GABAA receptor
genes were substantiated by cross-species comparative analysis and now require experimental
verification. The proposed model for the coordinate regulation of genes in the cluster accounts for
the head-to-head orientation and parallel expression of the α1 and β2 subunit genes, and for the
disruption of transcription caused by insertion of a neomycin gene in the close vicinity of the α6
gene, which is proximal to a putative critical S/MAR.

Background
The GABA type A (GABAA) synaptic receptor is a ligandgated ion channel (LGIC), an integral membrane protein
which mediates fast synaptic transmission. It is a member
of a superfamily of synaptic receptors which also includes
the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR). All of these
family members are membrane-spanning pentamers, the

five homologous subunits surrounding a central channel
(figure 1).
There exist at least 16 GABAA receptor subunit isoforms in
mammals, each encoded by a separate gene. These isoforms have been categorised into classes based upon
sequence similarity: six in the α subunit class, three β,

three γ, and one each of δ, ε, θ and π. Typically two α, two
β and one γ subunit assemble to form the GABAA receptor,
with a GABA binding site located at each α-β interface.
The most widely expressed and most common receptor
subtype is a combination of two α type 1 subunits with
two β type 2 and one γ type 2, which constitute in the
region of 40% of receptors in the mammalian brain [1].
Alternatively spliced subunit variants also contribute to
the diversity of GABAA receptor composition.
GABAA receptor subtypes are distributed differentially
within both cell type and region in the CNS, some subtypes being widespread whilst others have a very restricted
expression profile. This, and the observation that expression of receptor subtypes varies with developmental
stages, indicates that they each fulfil specific physiological
roles. Furthermore, the subunit composition of GABAA
receptor populations is not static within regions of the
adult CNS, and alterations of subunit expression are
observed in response to exposure to a large number of
neuroactive compounds [2].
These complexities in GABAA receptor subtype expression
are determined primarily at the level of transcription, by
cell-specific coordinate gene expression [3,4]. Typically,
both tissue-specific and ubiquitous transcription factors
are required to activate and control the expression of a
gene. Many genes which are expressed only in the nervous
system contain a 21-bp neuron-restrictive silencer element (NRSE) motif. This element binds with neuronrestrictive silencing factor (NRSF – also known as RE1
silencing transcription factor, REST) to repress gene
expression. Since this factor is expressed primarily in non-

neuronal tissues, the NRSE element acts as a gene silencer
in these tissues. The GABAA subunit γ2 gene contains an
NRSE site in the first intron, which was shown to bind to
NRSF and repress expression in non-neuronal cell lines.
There exist also NRSE-like sequences in the genes of
GABAA subunits α1,α5,α6,δ and β3, each downstream of
the TSS [5].
Generic cis-acting regulatory elements can also provide
tissue specific transcriptional regulation by binding to factors that are present in a tissue-specific manner. The SP1
binding site is recognized by a family of transcription factors, and has similar binding affinity with SP1, SP3, and
SP4 factors. Whilst SP1 and SP3 are ubiquitously
expressed, SP4 is relatively brain-specific. SP3 acts as
either an activator or a repressor, depending on promoter
context. One possible explanation of the neural specificity
of the α4 subunit promoter is that, in non-neuronal cells,
factors SP1 and SP3 binds with the SP1 site in the proximal promoter to suppress transcription, whereas in neurons SP3 and SP4 bind at the site to activate transcription
[6].
Alternate splicing of the GABAA receptor subunit gene
transcripts provides for mRNA subunit variants. The α2
subunit, for example, exhibits a complex pattern of alternative splicing, with distinct promoter regions for the
alternative mRNA isoforms. Although the resulting
encoded protein sequence is the same, variations in the
stability of mRNA isoforms can affect translational efficiency; these variations and the use of alternative promoters allow fine control of α2 subunit expression subunit
during brain development [7]. Multiple promoters exist

also for the α5 and β3 subunit genes, and provide for further diversity in their transcriptional and post-transcriptional control.
GABAA receptor subunit gene clusters
The genes encoding for vertebrate GABAA receptor subunit
genes are organised into several gene clusters on different
chromosomes, which appear to have arisen due to duplication and subsequent translocation of an ancestral gene
cluster. Two clusters on human chromosomes 4 and 5 are
composed of two α genes, one β, and one γ (Figure 1).
Another cluster on chromosome 15 is composed of one α,
one β and one γ gene [8]. Evidence that the clusters have
arisen by means of gene duplication events is provided by
the conservation of gene order, intergenic distance and
the head-to-head orientation of the α and β subunit genes
in each cluster. Based on conservation of genomic organization of GABAA receptor gene clusters, the ε and γ subunit genes appear to have a common ancestor.

This organisation into clusters may have been preserved to
provide a mechanism for facilitating coordinate gene
expression, by allowing adjacent clustered genes to share
regulatory elements. Genes in clusters may be co-regulated in part by the establishment of chromatin domains
which are insulated from surrounding genetic material by
chromatin boundaries. The genes for the components of
most common GABAA receptor subunit configuration, α1β2-γ2, lie within the same cluster on chromosome 5,
along with the α6 gene. All of the genes in this cluster are
highly expressed, at least in granule cells, in contrast to the
genes clustered on chromosomes 4 and 15, suggesting a
common transcriptional regulatory mechanism. However, the α6 gene has a much more restricted pattern of
expression, showing that it clearly also retains independent regulatory features.
Coordinate gene regulation and locus control regions
Co-regulated genes may each possess a copy of the same
transcriptional regulatory features, or they may share
common distal features such as enhancers [9] or Locus
Control Regions (LCRs)[10]. LCRs are regions of genomic
DNA which are able to exert long-range enhanced transcription of linked genes in a tissue-specific and copynumber dependant manner (i.e. proportionate to the
number of gene copies in transgenic experiments). They
are composite features, characterised biochemically by a
series of DNAse I hypersensitive sites (HSs), some of
which contain arrays of transcriptional factor binding
sites [10]. There is no single model for the long-range transcriptional control exerted by LCRs. They are thought to
both possess classic enhancer activity, recruiting the transcriptional machinery to gene promoters, and to play a
role in establishing and propagating chromatin opening.
LCRs are composed of varying numbers of both tissue-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/203

specific HSs and non-cell specific HSs, some of which are
non-functional, others fulfilling distinct roles in the augmentation of transcription. The HSs that constitute an
LCR are not necessarily clustered in a region of 1–2 kb, as
they are in the canonical human β- globin gene locus [11].
They may consist of HSs spread over large distances, and
be interspersed with the genes they control.
Experimental techniques (RNA TRAP and 3C) have verified that the human β-globin LCR directly comes into
direct contact with the DNA of the expressed gene whilst
the locus is transcriptionally active, with intervening DNA
looping out and away from the active region [12]. This
contact presumably facilitates chromatin-remodelling
activity in the vicinity of the gene, and also allows the LCR
enhancer elements and proximal promoter to cooperatively recruit transcriptional machinery proteins, as per
the classic model for enhancer function [13]. There is evidence that the human β-globin LCR interacts with only
one gene promoter at a time and that it may alternate
between two or more promoters, depending on the stage
of development [10].
LCRs, unlike simpler enhancer elements, operate in an
orientation-dependent manner with respect to the genes
they control [11]. It seems improbable, therefore, that a
canonical LCR could control both the α1 and β2 genes,
which unlike the genes in other LCR-controlled clusters,
are oriented in a head-to-head configuration. It seems
more likely that these genes are co-regulated by shared elements which are not orientation specific in relation the
genes they activate. Some genes migrate beyond their
immediate chromosomal territories to transcription factories, which are shared sites of transcription enriched in
RNA Pol II and transcriptional factors. Transcriptional
enhancer elements located in between the α1 and β2
genes could exert their effects on both genes, in a transcription factory located outside the of immediate chromosome territory ([13]. The chromatin of the
coordinately expressed genes in the HoxB cluster locates
in loops which extend outside of the chromosomal territory in expressing cells, but not in non-expressing cells
[14].
One model which reconciles the unrestricted activity of
enhancers implied by in the familiar looping model with
the positional effects observed in silencer elements, suggests that the enhancer first directs the assembly of, or
migration to, a transcription factory, and then reels in the
chromatin in search of a promoter. This model explains
how silencer elements could prevent gene access to the
transcriptional factory only if they are positioned between
enhancer and promoter [13] (see figure 21).

Chromatin dynamics and scaffold/matrix attachment
regions
Chromatin is a dynamic structure that modulates access to
DNA during gene replication and transcription. Whereas
housekeeping genes are generally partitioned into chromosomal segments which are constitutively in an open
conformation, tissue-specific genes tend to exist in segments which are facultatively opened [15]. Groups of
genes may be regulated autonomously by organising into
chromatin domains, which are maintained independently
from their surroundings and demarked by dynamic chromatin boundaries. Several models have been proposed to
explain how chromatin boundaries are established. Barrier activity may be accomplished by the creation of a
nucleosome gap to interrupt repressive histone modification, or barrier proteins may disrupt histone modifications associated with activation to prevent the
propagation of heterochromatin [13]. It seems clear that
chromatin domains are maintained by the tethering of a
loop of chromatin to a fixed structure, isolating it from
propagating histone modification processes associated
with chromatin condensation and transcriptional repression [16,17]. In eukaryotes, this structure is the nuclear
matrix (or nuclear scaffold), a network of proteins that
provides a framework for organising chromatin. Filaments of the nuclear matrix provide structural support for
the formation of loops of DNA during replication and
transcription. Attachment of genomic DNA to the nuclear
matrix also places genes in the domain in proximity to
chromatin-modifying complexes and the transcriptional
factors which enhance expression. Scaffold/Matrix Attachment Regions (S/MARs) are eukaryotic DNA sequences
capable of specific binding to nuclear proteins that are
part of the nuclear matrix. Their interactions with the
nuclear matrix provide anchor points from which chromatin loop domains can be established and maintains the
open chromatin conformation necessary for transcription.

The use of S/MARs as nuclear matrix anchors occurs in
vivo in a discriminative and tissue-specific manner [17].
Experimental evidence suggests that a subset of S/MAR
sequences may function as relatively static nuclear matrix
anchors, whilst other S/MARs act more dynamically to
draw the chromatin loop into transcriptional machinery
on the nuclear matrix surface, which is then scanned in
search of promoters using a chromatin reeling model,
thus promoting transcriptional initiation (figure 21). A
distinction is made between the relatively fixed structural
S/MARs serving as anchors, and functional S/MARS which
operate dynamically under the control of the transcriptional regulatory system to draw genes into the transcriptional machinery ([17]. S/MARS also may play a role in
demethylation of DNA regions to trigger chromatin opening. It seems reasonable to hypothesise that the coordi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/203

nate and tissue-specific regulation of genes in the GABAA
receptor clusters may be achieved at least in part by the S/
MAR-directed establishment of chromatin domains.
Down-regulation of α1 and β2 expression in α6 knockout
mice
In two separate experiments, the insertion of neomycin
hybrid genes into exon 8 of the α6 subunit gene region
brought about a parallel reduction in the expression of α1
and β2 in the forebrain of α6 subunit gene knockout mice
[18]. Expression of γ 2 mRNA was unaffected by the neomycin gene insert. This suggests that the insert may have
interfered with one or more long-distance regulatory features directing the coordinate expression of the α1 and β2
subunit genes. This feature could be an enhancer or an
LCR common to both genes and responsible for their
observed parallel expression profiles. Long-range disruption of neighbouring genes was also demonstrated by the
insertion of the PGK-Neo hybrid gene into the granzyme
B and β-globin gene locus, which also reduced expression
of multiple genes within the locus at distances greater
than 100 kb [19].

Any model proposed for the coordinate regulation of α1
and β2 subunit gene expression needs to incorporate the
observation that their expression is down-regulated upon
insertion of the neomycin gene in the vicinity of the α6
subunit gene. Uusi-Oukari et al [18] hypothesise that the
inserted sequence may contain cis-acting elements which
interact with an LCR to reduce its effectiveness as an
enhancer of α1 and β2 transcription. The presence of an
addition 2 kb or 5 kb of sequence could also critically alter
chromatin loop configuration or chromatin remodelling
processes; or the neomycin gene inserts in the vicinity of
an enhancer could disrupt assembly of, or migration to, a
transcription factory, causing a parallel decrease in expression of both genes.
Bioinformatics analysis of GABAA receptor subunit
transcription regulation
Investigation of the transcriptional regulation of GABAA
receptor subunit genes can provide an understanding of
mechanisms underlying the spatial and temporal expression patterns of GABAA receptor subunit expression,
which contribute to the aetiology of a wide range of neurological disorders and their responses to drug treatment.
Steiger & Russek [20] have conducted a comprehensive
review of GABAA receptor subunit gene regulatory features. In addition to summarising experimentally determined promoters, they used the Matinspector and NNNP
programs to predict additional promoter regions and
transcription factor binding sites. However, the published
predictions were based upon analysis of a single (mostly
human) genome for each subunit.

The purpose of the current work was to utilise a wide
range of promoter prediction software to analyse each
mammalian GABAA receptor subunit gene, and to use
comparative genomic analysis to further substantiate the
predictions made by these tools. Comparative analysis
can serve to eliminate false positives from the large result
sets typically created by Transcription Factor Binding Site
(TFBS) prediction programs, and to provide powerful evidence for the functionality of putative TFBSs. Functional
TFBSs sites are likely to be the conserved, and to be located
in equivalent positions in multiple sequence alignments
of homologous sequences, whereas false positives are not.
Additionally, this work attempts to look beyond the regulatory elements for individual genes to propose models
for higher level of transcriptional regulation of clustered
GABAA receptor genes, focusing upon the coordinate
expression of genes in the α1, β2, γ2 and α6 subunit cluster. The methods used for predicting features responsible
for coordinate expression included comparative analysis
of the cluster to reveal homologous regulatory features in
intergenic regions of DNA, prediction of distal regulatory
features as regions of DNase hypersensitivity, and prediction of Scaffold/Matrix Attachment Regions (S/MARS).

Results and discussion

GABAA α1 subunit gene
The α1 subunit gene is strongly expressed in all brain
regions, being a component of the most abundant GABAA
receptor subtype, α1β2γ2 [21]. Kang et al [22] have experimentally isolated a 60 bp minimal promoter element in
the 5' flanking DNA sequence of the human α1 subunit
gene. It was demonstrated that reduction in transcription
of the subunit gene following chronic benzodiazepine
exposure is brought about by direct repression of the
activity of this promoter. Bateson et al [23] have identified
the TSS for the chicken GABAAα1 subunit gene, and
reported a number of putative promoter elements, including a TATA box 30 bp upstream of the TSS, SP1 binding
site and reverse CCAAT box. The promoter region is CGrich. The TSS for the rat gene has also been experimentally
determined, and lies 5 bp 3' of the chicken TSS (A.N. Bateson, personal communication, unpublished).

An alignment was produced from the 5' flanking genomic
DNA sequence of the α1 receptor for four species –
human, chicken, mouse and rat (Figure 2). This alignment
reveals a highly conserved section, across all species, corresponding to the experimentally determined human promoter region, and the chicken and rat TSS. Sequence
identity is almost 100% in the core promoter region.
Sequence data for more evolutionarily distant species,
with sufficient identity to reveal any crucially conserved
motifs within more divergent regions of sequence, was
unavailable for the α1 subunit gene. The chicken TSS AGC
is unique in the alignment, replaced with CGC in the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/203

mammalian species. There exists cDNA sequence for the
mouse α1 gene which extends at 137 nt upstream relative
to the chicken TSS [23]. This suggests the presence of a TSS
upstream of that identified for the chicken, and the possibility of Multiple Start Sites for this gene. There is unpublished evidence that this is the case [24]. However, a scan
for promoter regions using the PromoterInspector program did not identify any putative promoter region
upstream of the mouse cDNA sequence. The TATA box
and SP1 site [23] are fully conserved. In addition, a DPE
element GGACG is conserved in its precise position with
respect to the chicken TSS (28 bp downstream). There is
also a conserved cAMP Response Element (CREB) element upstream of the minimal promoter, detected by the
P-MATCH program. An NFI motif CTCTGGCATGAAGTCACA lies between TATA box (partially overlapped) and
TSS. An NRSE-like sequence TTCAGCAAAGGAGCACGCAGA in the human gene lying approximately 115 bp
downstream of the TSS [20] is not conserved across species.
GABAA α2 subunit gene
The α2 subunit gene is strongly expressed only in the hippocampus and hypothalamus. Enhanced mRNA levels
occur early in CNS development, and decline postnatally
with a concurrent rise in α1 gene expression [7]. Fuchs &
Celepirovic [7] have investigated the rat α2 subunit gene,
and identified six α2 subunit mRNA isoforms with distinct 5-end UTRs (the resulting protein sequence is not
affected), generated from three alternative first exons by
means of alternative splicing and alternate promoter
usage. The isoforms are named AB8, SPL2, SPL3, SPL4,
SPL5 and non-spliced variant nonSPL. About 70% of
expressed mRNA is of the AB8 isoform. Multiple Starts
Sites (MSS) for each isoform were identified within each
of the three alternative first exons. The AB8 isoform putative promoter region is GC-rich, and contains putative
INR elements and TF binding sites, including SP1 binding
sites. Unusually, the AB8 promoter region is located
downstream from the transcription initiation sites [7].

The human α2 subunit gene also exhibits a complex pattern of alternative splicing and alternative promoter use
[24]. There are four major isoforms composed using combinations of alternative exons. Two alternative 5' exons
each lie downstream of two different promoter regions.
The alternative first exons and their promoters all lie
within a CpG island as detected by CPGPlot. MSS genes
are characterised by a transcription initiation window of
weak transcription start sites, and their promoters characteristically lack a TATA box. These characteristics are
apparent from an analysis of the putative core elements in
the identified rat and human promoter regions; the
sequences are largely devoid of TATA boxes or other
canonical core promoter motifs. An alignment was pro-

human and rat do not coincide. There are fully conserved

GABAA α3 subunit gene
The α3 subunit gene is expressed throughout the adult
brain. Like the α2 gene, enhanced expression occurs early
in CNS development and declines postnatally with an
accompanying rise in α1 expression [25]. The promoter

region and major TSS of the mouse α3 subunit gene have
been experimentally determined [25]. The highly unusual
promoter region contains a series of GA repeats about 40
bp upstream from the major TSS, which bind unspecified
nuclear proteins and directly augment transcription, and
in which lie several minor TSS sites. An adjacent series of
three GC repeats, forming part of a putative E2F sequence
motif, appear to also contribute to promoter activity.
An alignment was produced from the 5' flanking genomic
DNA sequence of the α3 subunit gene for 3 species –
human, mouse and rat (figure 4). The GA repeat regions,

corresponding to the experimentally determined mouse
promoter region, are of variable length across species [25].
The major TSS is conserved in the alignment. The core
promoter is apparently devoid of TATA boxes or INR-like
sequences. There is, however, a conserved DPE motif
GGAC [CT] located 29 bp downstream of the determined
TSS. Searches for TFBSs in the larger region encompassing
the GA repeat core promoter, using the TESS, P-MATCH

and MatInspector programs did not reveal any conserved
ubiquitous or neuronal TFBS motifs in the proximal
region upstream of the TSS.
GABAA α4 subunit gene
The α4 subunit gene is expressed variably in different
regions of the brain. Elevated expression levels are
observed in animal models of temporal lobe epilepsy, and

during withdrawal from alcohol and progesterone treatment, suggesting that the subunit may play a role in neuronal hyperexcitability [6]. Ma et el [6] have determined
the minimal promoter, major TSS and start codon ATG for
the mouse α4 subunit gene. They also identified two SP1
sites within the proximal promoter region which are critical for high-level promoter activity in vivo, and bind to
the TFs SP3 and SP4 to augment α4 subunit gene expression in neuronal cells. Other putative SP1, AP1, c-Myb,
and E-box binding sites did not alter transcription levels
when deleted. Roberts et al [26] have demonstrated
increases in mRNA levels of α4, and in early growth
response factor 3 (EGR3) expression, in response to

induced epilepsy, accompanied by increased binding of
EGR3 to α4 subunits in dentate granule cells. Also, EGR3
knockout mice exhibit reduced α4 hippocampal mRNA
expression. This data demonstrates the role of EGR3 as a
major regulator of α4 subunits, and implicates the factor
in epileptogenesis.
The promoter appears to contain no canonical core promoter elements. A predicted CpG island (CPGPlot) envelops the TSS. Recruitment of the basal transcription factors
to form the pre-initiation complex presumably involves
the SP1 sites in combination with one or more unknown
promoter elements. An alignment of the promoter region

for four species – human, cow, mouse and rat – reveals
that the TSS, and SP1 and EGR3 sites are conserved across
all species (figure 5). A motif AGCGCGGGCGAGTGTG
occurs only once immediately prior to the TSS in the
human sequence, but is exactly repeated in other species.
A conserved CREB element lies within the minimal promoter, upstream of the SP1 sites. There is also a conserved
NFI motif; however this lies outside of the identified
mouse minimal promoter region, immediately upstream
of the CDS.
GABAA α5 subunit gene
Expression of α5 subunit receptors is restricted primarily
to the hippocampus [21]. Kim et al [27] have identified
three isoforms of human α5 subunit mRNA, resulting
from three alternative first exons. They have demonstrated
that each exon appears to be regulated by a different promoter, located in intronic sequence regions immediately
upstream. The differential transcriptional activation by
alternative promoters may determine the alternative usage
of the first exon isoform. No core promoter element
motifs are observed in these promoter regions, however
both regions are enveloped within a single CpG island
and contain a large number of putative TF binding sites
including SP-1, AP-1 and AP-2 sites.

An alignment was produced for human, rat and mouse
sequences encompassing exons 1A, 1B, 1C and their associated promoter regions (figure 6). For the exon 1A promoter region, none of the putative binding sites identified
[27] are conserved in the alignment; however there is a
fully conserved NFI element within exon 1A, 124 bp
downstream of the TSS. Within the Exon 1B promoter
region lies a conserved sequence containing two overlapping reverse AP-2 motifs, and the exon itself contains IK2
and SP1 elements. Exon 1C and its promoter region are
not well conserved across species, and none of the identified putative binding sites [27] are conserved in the alignment (data not show).
GABAA α6 subunit gene
The α6 subunit gene is expressed exclusively in cerebellar
granule cells [28], and as such provides a useful model for
studying how neuron-specific gene expression is regulated. McLean et al [28] have identified several minor and
one major TSS with a surrounding INR in homologous rat
and mouse sequences. They have determined a 155 bp
minimal promoter in the rat DNA, within which a 60 bp
region, 70 bp upstream of the TSS, enhances expression in
cerebellar granule cells only. This region is positionally
dependent with respect to the TSS, and contains a conserved NF-1 (NFI, nuclear factor 1) motif. They have also
identified a downstream negative regulatory region which
is active in fibroblasts but inactive in cerebellar granule
cells. Wang et al [4] have determined that NFI-A factor is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/203

abundant in cerebellar granule cells and binds to the α6
subunit gene promoter in vivo in the mouse gene, confirming its critical role in α6 subunit gene expression and
the differentiation of cerebellar granule neurons. They
have also identified the NFI motif TGCCAAAAC within
the α6 gene promoter region which binds NFI-A proteins.
An alignment of the promoter region for four species –
human, chicken, mouse and rat – reveals that the rat and
mouse INR motif encompassing the TSS [28] is not conserved in the human and chicken (figure 7), however the
human sequence contains an INR-like motif TCAGACT 9
bp upstream. The chicken sequence also contains a putative INR CTAATTC in the same region. A DPE element
GGCTG at position +27 relative to mouse and rat TSS is
conserved across species. For rat and mouse sequences,
there exists a putative CCAAT box at position +10 relative
to the TSS (not conserved in human and chicken). The
NFI binding site [4] is fully conserved.
GABAA β1 subunit gene
The β1 subunit is present in a high proportion of the
GABAA receptors from the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, and a very small proportion of cerebellar GABAA
receptors [29]. The human β1 subunit gene contains a
TATA-less core promoter region of 270 bp [30]. The core
promoter is neural specific and contains an INR element
at the major TSS which is critical to promoter activity.
Upstream of the INR, A GRE consensus sequence has a
neural-specific positive regulatory effect, and CCAAT (NFY) and IK2 motifs have negative regulatory effects. Persistent receptor activation by the GABA neurotransmitter
induces down-regulation of β1 subunit mRNA expression.
The exposure to GABA appears to directly reduce promoter activity by modulating the binding of sequencespecific basal TFs to the promoters INR element, thus regulating formation of the Pre-Initiation Complex (PIC)
[30].

Each of the experimentally determined regulatory elements are conserved in an alignment of human and
mouse sequences encompassing the core promoter region
(figure 8). The negative regulatory sequence reported as
an IK2 binding site could also be interpreted as an OCT1
(octamer binding protein) motif GGGATTGAAATCTG. A
conserved SP1 motif is situated within the identified minimal promoter, 50 bp upstream of the major TSS.
GABAA β2 subunit gene
The β2 subunit is a component of the most abundant
GABAA receptor subtype, α1β2γ2, and is strongly
expressed in all brain regions, having an almost identical
expression profile to the α1 receptor. Alternative splicing
of the gene generates two transcript variants, differing by
a 114 bp insertion [31]. There is currently no experimen-

tal data available for transcription regulatory features in
the β2 subunit gene. In order to search for a putative promoter region, GenBank DNA sequence for the human β2
subunit gene was searched using the programs PromoterInspector, NNPP, Promoter 2 and McPromoter, within a
region extending from 2000 bp upstream of the mRNA
start point to approximately 500 bp downstream. The
results were compared and combined to derive a consensus predicted promoter region of 900 bp, 510 bp
upstream of the GenBank CDS for further analysis.
Homologous DNA sequences were then obtained for the
β2 subunit gene in the mouse, rat and domestic dog species. This data was used to generate a multiple sequence

alignment (figure 9), revealing a highly conserved region
(78% for putative core promoter), containing putative
TATA box, INR and DPE elements. Searches for TFBSs in
the larger region encompassing the putative core promoter, using the TESS, P-MATCH and MatInspector programs did not reveal any fully conserved ubiquitous or
neuronal TFBS motifs, however there is a partially conserved SP1 sequence and a CREB element upstream of the
putative core promoter.

expressed in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum. It is frequently co-localised with either a β1 or β2 subunit in the
same GABAA receptor, in proportions which vary with
brain region [29]. The human β3 subunit gene contains
two alternate first exons, 1 and 1A, which are expressed
differentially during development and between different
brain regions, and encode two dissimilar signal peptidelike sequences. Exon 1A lies upstream of exon 1 and
encodes a peptide signal sequence. Transcription of exon
1A is initiated by multiple start sites in a pyrimidine-rich
promoter region, which lies in between the alternative
first exons, and binds SP1 and other nuclear factors.
Nuclear factor binding sites overlap each of these transcription start sites, which may be involved in differential

expression of the alternative first exons. The human and
rat coding and promoter regions are highly conserved
[32].
An alignment was produced of the human and mouse 5end gene sequences, encompassing the upstream regions
of the alternate first exons (figure 10). There are three conserved SP1 sequences upstream of exon 1, and a partially
conserved TATA box. The exon 1A promoter region contains no canonical core promoter elements. This is not
surprising given that it is composed almost entirely of pyramidines. Several conserved SP1-like sequences are
located upstream from the pyrimidine-rich promoter
region.

GABAA γ1 subunit gene
Expression of the γ1 subunit is more restricted than that of
the γ2 subunit, occurring at high levels predominantly in
certain amygdaloid, hypothalamic and premammillary
nuclei [33]. The γ1 subunit gene promoter region has not
been characterised. Analysis of the 2000 bp region
upstream of the GenBank computationally-derived TSS
for the human sequence by PromoterInspector and
McPromoter predicted no promoter in this region; however the NNPP and Promoter 2 programs predicted promoter regions, 251–301 bp and 489–589 bp upstream of
the GenBank TSS respectively. Homologous rat and
mouse sequences for the human region encompassing the

predicted promoter regions and GenBank TSS were
obtained and aligned (figure 11). The GenBank putative
TSS and CDS for each species is conserved in the alignment. An INR consensus sequence CCACACT is located
16 bp upstream of the human GenBank TSS. The region
also contains an IK2 binding sequence and two conserved
reverse CCAAT boxes, which could also be interpreted as
NF1 binding sites.
GABAA γ2 subunit gene
The γ2 subunit gene is expressed widely throughout the
brain, occurring at high levels early on in CNS development [21]. Mu and Burt [5] have found two major tran-

scription start sites in a TATA-less promoter region of the
mouse γ2 subunit gene. There are two subtypes of the subunit, which are formed by alternate splicing which is
regionally and developmentally regulated. The first intron
of both the mouse and human γ2 genes contains a conserved neuron-restrictive silencer element (NRSE) site,
which was shown to bind to NRSF and direct expression
in neuronal cells, and to repress expression in non-neuronal cells. Another sequence element, the "Gamma Promoter Element" (GPE1), which also promotes expression
in neuron-like cells, lies 70 bp downstream of the second
major TSS. Mu and Burt [5] report that "probably only a
portion of the 24 bp sequence is involved". The first 12 bp
matches the cAMP-responsive element binding protein
(CREB) consensus sequence (program P-MATCH).

An alignment of the promoter region for four species –
human, cow, mouse and rat – reveals that the identified
region maintains a very high level of conservation across
all species downstream of the TSS (figure 12). Sequence
identity is 88% in this region, but is not so high at the 5end of the first major TSS. A number of putative TFBS
sites, including NF1, AP2, and several SP1 sequences, are
in conserved in the alignment downstream of the TSS
sites. The experimentally determined NRSF and GPE elements [5] are also conserved in all species. The promoter
appears to be without TATA box or INR; there exists however a conserved DPE sequence AGC [TC]G located at +27
bp with respect to the second the mouse major TSS.

GABAA γ3 subunit gene
The γ3 subunit gene is expressed at low level in the cerebellum and hippocampus [33]. The gene promoter has
not yet been experimentally determined. Analysis of the
2000 bp region upstream of the GenBank computationally-derived TSS for the human sequence by the PromoterInspector, McPromoter, NNPP and Promoter 2 programs
gives a consensus promoter prediction within a region
approximately 550–100 bp upstream of the GenBank
putative TSS and CDS. This region is GC rich and contains
no TATA sequences. The program CPGPlot predicts a 554
bp CpG island which matches closely the putative promoter region. The γ3 subunit gene promoter may therefore lie within a CpG island, in common with a number
of other GABAAreceptor subunit genes such as α2, α4, α5
and δ. Although such 5-end CpG islands commonly
extend downstream of the promoter into the transcription
unit [34], this does not appear to be the case for any of the
GABAA subunit genes.

An alignment of the region was generated using human
and homologous mouse sequence (figure 13). The region
contains numerous putative regulatory elements such as
SP1, AP2 and NRSE, detectable by MatInspector etc; however these are generally not conserved in the alignment.
An INR element TCAAC located 70 bp downstream of the
start of the predicted CpG island is conserved.
GABAA δ subunit gene
Expression of the GABAA receptor δ subunit gene is most
abundant in granule cells of the cerebellum and dentate
gyrus. The 5-end of the murine δ subunit gene contains a
region with CpG island features, and lacks canonical promoter elements such as the TATA box [35]. The rat δ subunit gene and promoter has been characterised by
Motejlek et al [3] who have mapped the major TSS, which
is enclosed within an INR element CCACTCT. The promoter region lies within a CpG island. They have also
identified a 22-bp purine-rich element, present in seven
partially-overlapping copies, approximately 1800 nucleotides upstream of the TSS. The element is bound by a
novel "brain-specific factor" (BSF1) that is present predominantly in cerebellar granule cells, correlating with
GABAAδ subunit expression, however it is not clear if the
factor plays any role in transcription regulation of the δ
subunit gene.

An alignment was produced using the genomic sequence
encompassing the rat promoter region with upstream
purine-rich BSF1 element repeats, and homologous
human and mouse sequences. Whilst there is homologous sequence between species for the promoter region
(figure 14), no sequence similar to the BSF1 element
repeats is observable for the human and mouse. A functional negative strand NRSF binding site [5] exists down-

stream
of
the
TSS
in
the
first
exon,
TCCGCCGTCCTCGGTGCTGAA. This is conserved, with a
single nucleotide deletion in the human sequence. The
INR element enclosing the major TSS is not conserved in
the human sequence. A number of putative SP1 sites are
detectable in the region but generally these are not fully
conserved in the alignment.
GABAA ε subunit gene
Alternative splicing of the ε subunit gene yields a number
of different transcript isoforms. Expression of the full protein sequence occurs abundantly only in discrete areas of
the adult brain, such as the hypothalamus and locus ceruleus. In other tissues, truncated subunit protein sequences
are transcribed [36]. The ε subunit gene promoter has not
been characterised. The programs McPromoter, NNPP
Cister and Promoter 2 predicted no promoter in the 2000
bp region upstream of the GenBank computationallyderived CDS for the human sequence GABAAε subunit
gene; however the program PromoterInspector predicted
a 324 bp promoter within a region approximately 400 bp
upstream of the GenBank computationally-derived CDS.
For the mouse sequence, PromoterInspector also predicts
a 200 bp promoter in a 180 bp upstream of the GenBank
CDS.

The human predicted promoter region encompasses that
of the mouse in a sequence alignment (figure 15). However, the use of cross-species sequence alignments to
search for conserved transcription regulatory features is
particularly problematic for the ε and θ subunits, because
the genes from mouse and rat have been shown to display
an unusually high level of divergence from their human
homologues, and appear to be evolving at a faster rate
than other GABAA receptor subunits [37]. The ε and θ subunit expression patterns and the functional properties of
receptors containing these units may differ significantly
between species. The transcription regulatory features will
therefore probably be more variable between species than
for the other subunits.
The putative region appears to contain no fully conserved
canonical core promoter features, however the mouse and
rat sequence have an INR motif CCAGACC 45 bp
upstream of the GenBank CDS, whereas the human
sequence contains an INR motif at the beginning of the
putative promoter region. For all species, the region has
the features of a CpG island (CPGPlot), and contains conversed SP1 binding site sequences.
GABAA θ subunit gene
GABAA receptor θ subunits show very similar distributions
to ε subunits throughout the brain, and may also vary significantly between species [37]. Novel α3θε GABAA receptors

pharmacological properties may form in monoaminergic
neuronal cell-groups [38]. There is no experimental data
for the θ subunit promoter. Promoter prediction programs were used to search both mouse and human
sequences. No promoters were predicted by the MatInspector or McPromoter programs in either sequence. The

program NNPP predicts two core promoters in the human
sequence approximately 1500–1600 bp upstream of the
GenBank TSS. Each putative promoter has a TATA motif.
No promoter was predicted by NNPP in the homologous
mouse sequence, and the TATA sequences are not conserved.

the transcription regulatory features may therefore be
more variable between species than for the other subunit
genes, a high level of sequence identity was observed in
the aligned putative promoter regions for these genes,
with conservation of putative core promoter elements.
GABAA π subunit gene
The subunit encoded by this gene is expressed in several
non-neuronal tissues, and most abundantly in the uterus
[39].

The π subunit gene promoter has not yet been experimentally determined. The programs PromoterInspector,
McPromoter and NNPP predicted no promoters in the
2000 bp region upstream of the GenBank start point for
the human GABAAπ subunit gene sequence. Program Promoter 2 makes a marginal prediction (score 0.613) of a
promoter between 200–300 bp upstream. There are several INR motifs in the human sequence 450 bp upstream
of the gene start point, one of which with a DPE element
at +28 from the putative TSS. However when an alignment
was made with homologous sequence from the cow gene
these motifs were not conserved (figure 17). Putative AP1

and SP1 sites found by the Cister program in the vicinity
of this region of sequence were not conserved.
The 5-end of this gene displays some characteristics of a
multiple start site promoter region such as that observed
in the α2 subunit gene. Here also, there is no TATA
sequence or well-defined TSS, but a number of INR motifs
form a transcription initiation window of weak transcription start sites, which again are not fully conserved across
species. Sequence identity in this region is lower than in
the promoters of GABAA receptor genes with a single TSS,
and individual start sites are not as well conserved. This
appears to be characteristic of MSS promoters, and is presumably a result of relaxed selected pressure due to a
degree of redundancy introduced by MSS transcription. It
is quite possible also that the computationally derived
GenBank gene origin is incorrect, and the TSS and promoter may lie outside this region of sequence.
Transcriptional regulation of the GABAA receptor subunit
gene cluster on chromosome 5
The human α1, β2, γ2 and α6 subunit gene cluster is
located on chromosome 5q33 and spans 500–700 kb. The

genes lie in the order β 2 - α 6 - α 1 - γ 2, with β2 and α6
in a head-to-head orientation. α6 high-level expression is
restricted to cerebellar granule cells, and is probably regulated independently from the other genes in the cluster
[18]. Wang et al [4] have determined that NFI-A factor is
abundant in cerebellar granule cells and binds the α6 subunit promoter, playing a critical role in α6 gene expression. The γ2 subunit gene's expression profile overlaps
with that of α1 and β2, but is yet more widespread, combining with several subtype variants in addition to the
most common 2α 1 - 2β 2 - 1γ 2 configuration. Transcriptional control of γ2 is therefore at least partially independent from that of α1 and β2. Its promoter is known to
contain an NRSF binding site and a "Gamma Promoter
Element", both of which direct expression in neuronal
cells [5].
The α1 and β2 genes are widely expressed in neural tissue,
and have almost identical expression profiles. The ques-

tion therefore arises as to whether they have the same
expression profiles by virtue of each possessing common
transcriptional regulatory features in individual promoters, or whether coordinate regulation is achieved by the
action of shared long-range transcriptional regulatory elements such as enhancers, silencers or an LCR. The α1 subunit gene core promoter is well characterised, and
contains a canonical promoter [23], with TATA box, INR
and DPE motifs, and an upstream SP1 site, typical of ubiquitously expressed housekeeper genes. There are also
putative sites for NFI and NRSE in the α1 subunit gene,
but there is no experimental evidence that they are
required for tissue-specific expression (indeed, the NRSE
motif is not conserved in cross-species alignments).
Although the β2 subunit gene core promoter is undetermined, computational analysis here provides evidence
that this subunit is under the control of a very similar promoter, with TATA box, INR, DPE core elements, also with
an upstream SP1 site. Based upon this predicted pro-

moter, the β2 subunit expression profile may closely

Prediction of long-range regulatory features using
comparative analysis
Both proximal and long-range regulatory features are
more highly conserved between species by evolutionary

selective pressure than is the surrounding non-regulatory
DNA. Functional long-range regulatory features in a gene
cluster should therefore stand out as relatively short
regions of intergenic sequence which are more highly conserved than the surrounding background DNA. In order to
investigate whether the α1 and β2 subunit genes share
common long-range regulatory elements, the rVista program ([40] was used to perform cross-species, compara-

tive analysis of the human chromosome 5 GABAA cluster
locus, and intergenic homologous regions were isolated
for further analysis.
Firstly the human and chicken DNA sequences were compared. A cluster of three conserved regions with sequence
identity greater than 70% were identified between 3–5 kb
from the end of the β2 gene (figure 18). The first of these
regions (numbered 1 in figure 18), 458 bps with 81.2%
identity, is particularly rich in putative sites for ubiquitous
or neural tissue-associated TFBSs. It includes motifs for
NFI, a regulator of the α6 subunit [4], OCT1, FOX (forkhead box) and EGR3, which is linked with α4 subunit
promoter activity [26]. Given the location of the three
human-chicken homologous intergenic sequences, 3–5
kb beyond the final β2 subunit gene exon, it is also possible that the high sequence identity indicates the presence
of a degenerate or un-annotated alternative exon. For the
third sequence, for example, a possible ORF extends from
base 73 to 234 on the reverse (β2 gene) strand. However,
as the region is rich in regulatory motifs it probably merits
further analysis as a possible locus for regulation of one or
more genes in the cluster. Several other regions of
unknown function in the cluster were locally conserved
between human and chicken, but were not enriched with
TFBS motifs.

The rVista program was also used to compare human and
mouse DNA in the GABAA cluster, to identify potential
regulatory features limited to mammalian species. This
revealed a number of intergenic homologous regions with
sequence identity greater than 75%, not conserved in the
chicken species. These were further analysed for putative
neuronal or ubiquitous TFBS motifs. In addition to the
motifs found in the conserved chicken homolog, these
regions contain motifs for STAT (signal transducer and
activator of transcription), CEBP (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein), CDP (CCAAT displacement protein), NF
(Nuclear Factor) Kappa B, activator protein 4 (AP4),
upstream stimulating factor (USF), activating transcription factor (ATF), enhancer factor 4 (E4F). An analysis of
conserved intergenic regions is summarised in figure 18.
Each of these conserved regions represent potential distal
regulatory elements for one or more of the genes in the
cluster, which could be inactivated by the neomycin gene
insert [18] which was observed to cause disruption of α1
and β2 expression.
Potential DNase I hypersensitive sites in the gene cluster
Regions of DNase I hypersensitivity within a gene locus,
which are not associated with core promoters, are indicators of distal cis-regulatory elements such as enhancers or
silencers [41]. Clusters of HSs provide markers for possi-

ble LCRs controlling transcription in the locus. As there is
currently no HS prediction tool available, the locus of the
GABAA chromosome 5 cluster was analysed based upon
published locations of predicted HSs [41] (Coordinates
are from the April 2003 human genome assembly).
Although this data is based upon analysis of erythroid
sequences, it was hypothesised that a proportion of the
predicted sites would also be DNase I hypersensitive in
other cell lines [41,42], including neuronal cells.
An analysis of the gene cluster reveals that there are 18
predicted HSs within the 862 kb locus. The positions of
the β2, α6 and α1 gene promoters in the cluster closely
coincide with HS predictions, illustrating the potential
value of this approach. Nine of the 18 predicted HSs conspicuously fall into a 2.5 kp region, which is contiguous
apart from three 125 bp segments. This putative HS cluster, approximately 1.5 kb downstream from the β2 gene
(on the anti-sense strand in figure 19), is a candidate site
for a transcriptional regulatory region controlling one or
more genes in the cluster. The proximity to the β2 promoter suggests a regulatory feature specific to this gene.
Or, based upon the beta globin and other LCR models,
these could be constitutive HSs clustered with other neuronal-specific HSs forming an LCR, augmenting transcription of both β2 and α1. HSs, like other transcriptional
control sequences, tend to be conserved across species
[42], and the organisation of the β-globin LCR, for example, is highly conserved in the human and the mouse gene
locus [11]. There is no cross-species data available for HSs
in the GABAA receptor gene cluster locus with which to
perform comparative analysis. However, it is of interest to
note that the predicted cluster of HSs corresponds closely
with a cluster of four intergenic homologous regions identified by comparative analysis of human and mouse DNA
(figure 18, numbered 4–7).
Prediction of S/MARS and a model for coordinate
regulation of β2 and α1 subunit genes
The program MAR-Wiz was used to predict S/MARS
within and around the human chromosome 5 GABAA
receptor gene cluster, and in the homologous mouse cluster on chromosome 11. Results with a cut-off score of 0.7
were considered.

For both species, S/MARs are predicted in the vicinity of
the α6 gene promoter region, and flanking the gene cluster (figure 20). This configuration, with a centrally located
S/MAR and two S/MARs flanking the cluster, suggests the
model similar to that proposed by Heng et al [17], in
which S/MARs are selectively utilised to provide two functions: as structural anchor points for chromosomal attachment to the nuclear matrix, and as dynamic features
which draw potentiated chromatin loops into transcriptional machinery in the proximity of the nuclear matrix.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/203

The model proposed here (figure 21) is also based partially upon that proposed for the multigenic human protamine chromatin domain, where in absence of a welldefined LCR, S/MARS bounding the domain act synergistically to regulate the expression of the gene cluster [15]:
(a) Firstly, the region surrounding the gene cluster is
anchored to the nuclear matrix by flanking S/MARS,
which establish a tissue-specific chromatin domain and
define the boundaries of transcriptional activity by preventing the propagation of chromatin condensation, thus
shielding the locus from the silencing effects of neighbouring chromatin. Tethering of the domain to the
nuclear matrix may also bring it into proximity with chromatin modifying processes which participate in opening
of the chromatin loop domain to potentiate transcription.
(b) A central, functional S/MAR in the vicinity of the α6
subunit gene promoter migrates to the nuclear matrix,
under the control of accessory transcriptional regulator
factors. This causes the potentiated chromatin to associate
with transcriptional machinery proximal to the nuclear
matrix. The location is approximately 100 kb from a
region containing a cluster of predicted for HSs, which
was also observed to be rich in conserved putative TFBSs
upon comparative analysis of the human and mouse
genomes. The central S/MAR may also play a role in the
demethylation of DNA regions to trigger further chromatin conformational changes.
(c) The transcriptional machinery reels in the open chromatin in either direction until a promoter is encountered,
at which point gene transcription initiates. Whilst the α6
and γ2 genes in the cluster are regulated independently by
other cell-specific TFs, a shared complement of TFs and
corresponding cis-regulatory elements presumably
accounts for the identical expression profile of the β2 and
α1 subunit genes. Distal enhancer elements, some of
which are shared by both β2 and α1 subunit genes, may
loop back into the region of the transcriptional machinery
to provide tissue-specific transcriptional augmentation.
(d) Transcriptional elongation causes the functional S/
MAR to dissociate from the vicinity of the nuclear matrix,
so that once the transcription is complete, a new cycle of
transcription can be initiated. Selection of either the β2 or
α1 gene for transcription may be random, or there may be
an unknown mechanism of alternating the expression of
β2 and α1 to ensure parallel expression levels.
The model provides an explanation for number of observations – the head-to-head configuration of the β2 and α1
subunit genes, their parallel expression profiles, and the
parallel down-regulation of expression observed upon
insertion of the neomycin gene insert at exon 8 of the α6

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:203

subunit gene [18], which is the vicinity of the proposed
functional S/MAR, and is presumably close enough to
interact and to reduce its effectiveness. The basic model
could also incorporate expression of the α6 subunit,
assuming that additional gene-specific factors contribute
to produce a different tissue-specific expression profile.
However it is probable that the functional S/MAR would
not be critical for γ 2 gene transcription, since its expression is unaffected by the neomycin gene insert and subsequent S/MAR disruption.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/203

for a number of features of the gene cluster and its regulation, including the orientation of the genes, and disruption of α1 and β2 subunit gene transcription by the
insertion of a neomycin gene in the close vicinity of the α6
gene, which is proximal to a critical S/MAR. A first step in
verification of this model would be the use of Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) techniques to visualise
the localisation of labelled predicted S/MARs on the
nuclear matrix.

Methods
Conclusion
In silico comparative analysis of GABAA receptor subunit
genes was performed to predict potential regulatory features and in particular to identify the means of coordinate
regulation in the gene cluster comprising the α1, β2, γ2
and α6 subunits. Bioinformatics resources were used to
generate a number of predictions which were substantiated by cross-species comparative analysis and are subject
to wet-laboratory verification. Putative promoters were
identified for the β2, γ1, γ3, ε, θ and π subunits, which
may be experimentally verified by cloning of the identified DNA segment and screening for promoter activity
using luciferase reporter gene assays. Putative core elements and proximal TFs were identified within these predicted promoters, and within the experimentally
determined promoters of the other subunits.
A region of predicted DNase I hypersensitive sites within
the GABAA receptor cluster on human chromosome 5 represents a candidate site for transcriptional regulatory features controlling one or more genes in the cluster. The
experimental procedures RNA TRAP and 3C could be used
to verify whether this region comes into contact with the
DNA of the expressed genes whilst transcriptionally
active, as described by established models for enhancer
action [13].
Given the disparate orientations of the genes in this cluster, it seems unlikely that they are under the control of a
canonical, orientation-dependent LCR. Based upon a
putative promoter identified for the β2 subunit gene, it is
possible that its expression profile closely matches that of
the α1 subunit at least in part by possessing the same core
promoter characteristics. The model proposed here for
their coordinate regulation is based upon the selective use
of S/MARS, in which the chromosomal sequence surrounding the gene cluster is first anchored to the nuclear
matrix by flanking S/MARS to establish the boundaries of
transcriptional activity, and further directed by another
functional S/MAR. Spatial and temporal fine-control of
transcriptional activity may be achieved by gene-specific
factors and cis-regulatory elements, but other distal, intergenic putative regulatory elements were isolated and may
be common to both α1 and β2 genes. The model accounts

Core promoter prediction
For each GABAA receptor subunit, DNA sequence data was
obtained from the NCBI website for analysis. In most
cases, the sequences were the latest versions of genomic
DNA from the Entrez Gene database. Where the promoter
region or gene transcription start site is undetermined, the
sequences are normally annotated in GenBank with an
mRNA start point, derived by automated computational
analysis, sometimes with supporting experimental evidence. The first 1000 base pairs upstream of the given 5'end were typically used for initial analysis. This region of
sequence was presumed to contain the core and promoter
region and proximal regulatory elements. A number of
promoter prediction programs were used, including PromoterInspector [43], NNPP [44], McPromoter [45], CISTER [46] and Promoter 2 [47]. These are popular, freely
available program which each use different promoter-predicting methodologies – neural nets, HMMs and contextbased approaches. Typically, several of these programs
were used on the sequence to build up a consensus prediction for the core promoter region, which was then further
analysed for individual regulatory features. Default
options and parameters were used with these programs
unless stated otherwise. To search for TFBSs in promoter
regions, the Transcription Element Search System (TESS,
[48]), P-MATCH ([49] and program MatInspector [9]
were used. These programs each provide searches
restricted by organism and tissue type; the search results
were restricted to binding sites for vertebrate factors which
are either ubiquitous or neuron-specific.
Comparative promoter analysis
Comparative analysis can provide powerful evidence for
the in vivo functionality of TF binding, and provides a
means to eliminate false positives from the large result
sets typically created by PWM-based TFBS prediction programs. Functional TF binding sites are likely to be situated
in conserved non-coding regions, and furthermore, to be
located in equivalent positions across genomes [12]. For
each GABAA receptor subunit, sequences from several species were used to generate multiple sequence alignments
of the gene promoter regions to identify conserved features. The alignments were performed using the CLUS-

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:203

TALW (1.81) Multiple Sequence Alignments program
using default options unless stated otherwise.
The success of the comparative sequence analysis
approach is largely dependent upon the selection of species which are at a suitable evolutionary distance. The
sequence difference between closely related species will
not provide any meaningful filtering of results, whilst
comparison of highly unrelated species will be unlikely to
reveal any conserved binding sites. In each case, sequences
from human and mouse gene promoter regions were used
with those for other selected available species. Sequence
data for human and mouse is available for all GABA receptor subtypes, and the species are generally at a suitable
evolutionary distance for the effective filtering of results.
Sequence conservation between these species in non-coding regions was taken as additional evidence for the biological significance of predicted regulatory features.
Quoted sequence identity scores were derived by using the
alistat program provided as part of the HMMER 2.2 g
HMM analysis package (hmmer.wustl.edu), using the
Clustal X alignments as input. In most cases, only putative
TF binding sites and promoter features which are largely
conserved in all species in the alignment are reported in
the results section. The filtering of TFBS predictions by
species, cell specificity and finally by conservation in
alignments reduces the number of predicted TFBSs to realistic levels, albeit at the risk of eliminating true positives
from the result sets.
Evidence for gene cluster co-regulatory features
Co-regulated genes may each possess the same promoter
features, or they may share common regulatory features.
Whilst analysis of the individual gene promoters can identify the former, prediction of long-range features responsible for the coordinate expression of several genes requires
analysis of the whole gene cluster sequence. Regions of
intergenic sequence which are more highly conserved
than the surrounding background DNA would be strong
candidates for such functional regulatory features. The
rVista 2.0 program [40] was used to perform cross-species,
comparative analysis of the human chromosome 5
GABAA cluster locus in order to identify potential intergenic regulatory elements in addition to the core promoters of individual genes. The program offers a combination
of signal-based TFBS searches with comparative sequence
analysis to reduce the number of false positive matches
and to provide supporting evidence for site functionality.
Predicting distal regulatory features as regions of DNase
hypersensitivity
HSs occur over shorter stretches of DNA (typically ~250
bp), and are perhaps two orders of magnitude more sensitive to DNAse I than bulk chromatin [10]. Formation of
hypersensitivity is a result of interaction of multiple trans-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/203

acting factors bound to cis-regulatory elements, and is
taken as a reliable indicator of functional transcriptional
features, such as promoters and enhancers, in non-coding
DNA [41].
Noble et al [41] used a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to
recognize HSs in genomic sequence data. The SVM was
used to predict HSs for all non-repetitive sequence in the
human genome, partitioned into 225 bp segments. Highscoring positive-predicted values in subsequent experimental validation of the predicted HSs suggested to the
authors that "elements identified by the SVM might represent a class of HSs that are active in many tissues or are
even constitutive." [41]. Crawford et al [42] have used
high-throughput experimental analysis to identify clusters
of HSs in CD4+ T cells (lymphocytes) for a representative
sample of sequences from the human genome. Whilst
10% of the HSs thus identified are only detectable in lymphocytes, the remaining 90% were confirmed as HSs for
all tested cell types. Whilst there is as yet no generally
available tool for predicting HSs, this data suggests that a
high percentage of sites of DNase I hypersensitivity in one
tissue type could also be so in other tissue types, including
neuronal tissue. Based upon this hypothesis, the predicted
HSs [41] were analysed as possible markers for LCRs and
other distal regulatory elements such as enhancers or
silencers, controlling transcription in the locus of the
chromosome 5 GABAA gene cluster.
Prediction of scaffold/matrix associated regions
S/MARS are found either in non-transcribed regions, at
the borders of chromatin domains, or in close association
with non-coding transcription elements such as enhancers or introns. S/MARs themselves are often rich in TF
binding sites, with a local over-representation of specific
AT-rich motifs. [50,51]. MAR-Wiz http://futuresoft.org/
MarFinder/ is a web-based tool for predicting S/MARs
based upon a number of analysis rules including origin of
replication, TG-richness, curved DNA, kinked DNA, and
topoisomerase II recognition. MAR-Wiz was used to predict S/MAR regions in the gene cluster locus, as potential
anchor points delimiting chromatin loop domains.
