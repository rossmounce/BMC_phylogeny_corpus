Abstract
Background: No recognized risk factors can be identified in 10-40% of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients
suggesting that the modes of transmission involved could be underestimated or unidentified. Invasive diagnostic
procedures, such as endoscopy, have been considered as a potential HCV transmission route; although the actual
extent of transmission in endoscopy procedures remains controversial. Most reported HCV outbreaks related to
nosocomial acquisition have been attributed to unsafe injection practices and use of multi-dose vials. Only a few
cases of likely patient-to-patient HCV transmission via a contaminated colonoscope have been reported to date.
Nosocomial HCV infection may have important medical and legal implications and, therefore, possible transmission
routes should be investigated. In this study, a case of nosocomial transmission of HCV from a common source to
two patients who underwent colonoscopy in an endoscopy unit is reported.
Results: A retrospective epidemiological search after detection of index cases revealed several potentially infective
procedures: sample blood collection, use of a peripheral catheter, anesthesia and colonoscopy procedures. The
epidemiological investigation showed breaches in colonoscope reprocessing and deficiencies in the recording of
valuable tracing data. Direct sequences from the NS5B region were obtained to determine the extent of the
outbreak and cloned sequences from the E1-E2 region were used to establish the relationships among intrapatient
viral populations. Phylogenetic analyses of individual sequences from viral populations infecting the three patients
involved in the outbreak confirmed the patient pointed out by the epidemiological search as the source of the
outbreak. Furthermore, the sequential order in which the patients underwent colonoscopy correlates with viral
genetic variability estimates.
Conclusions: Patient-to-patient transmission of HCV could be demonstrated although the precise route of
transmission remained unclear. Viral genetic variability is proposed as a useful tool for tracing HCV transmission,
especially in recent transmissions.

Background
HCV is predominantly transmitted by the parenteral
route in procedures such as unscreened blood transfusions, injections related to intravenous drug use (IDU),
injections related to health-care procedures, invasive
medical and surgical interventions and, to a lesser extent,
other percutaneous exposures [1-3]. Perinatal or sexual
transmissions are considered far less efficient than transmission through large or repeated parenteral exposure
[1,4-6]. Current HCV prevalence worldwide is far from

even [4,5] and is expected to fluctuate according to both
availability and adherence to prevention measures at
health-care facilities and also to changes in IDU-related
habits [5]. HCV prevalence, estimated to be about 3% in
1999 [7], is mainly due to past infected blood transfusions and past and present injected drug use. Due to the
asymptomatic nature of most HCV infections, the epidemic remains largely unnoticed with most chronic cases
having been infected years ago, and with relatively few
cases of acute infections being reported [8].
Interestingly, risk factors accounting for infection
remain unknown in 10-40% of the patients with acute
or chronic hepatitis C [6,9]. In contrast to chronic hepatitis, cases of recent HCV infection could shed greater

light on mechanisms of HCV transmission because the
source of infection can be traced more accurately [8].
HCV infection associated with medical procedures,
which are still unrecognised or underestimated, is an
issue of great concern [8,10]. A nosocomial HCV mode
of transmission that remains controversial is diagnostic
or therapeutic digestive endoscopy (gastroscopy and
colonoscopy). These infection routes are not even mentioned in recent reviews specifically dealing with the epidemiology of HCV infection [4,5], although they receive
varying attention in others [3,6].
The first patient-to-patient hepatitis C transmission
through colonoscopy was reported by Bronowicki et al.
in 1997 [11]. Since then, a full consensus has been
reached about the relationship between strict adherence
to standard safety measures and null risk of transmission via endoscopy or endoscopy-related procedures
[12,13]. However, further doubts have been casted on
the true extent of HCV transmission via these procedures, ranging from rarely reported [13] to underestimated [14]. Two case-control studies carried out in
France reported significant association between HCV
infection and endoscopy procedures [15,16]. These studies showed that no significant decrease in this endoscopy-associated risk was found between 1980 and 1999
[15], and that HCV was still transmitted in France
through specific invasive procedures including digestive
endoscopy, at least, until 2002 [16].
A problem associated with identifying the source of
nosocomial HCV infection is that retrospective transmission studies often fail to identify the exact procedure
causing infection [10,14]. Hence, only well-documented

case reports contribute to providing evidence for this
particular HCV transmission in healthcare units. In two
recent studies of patient-to-patient HCV transmission in
endoscopy units [17,18], unsafe injection practices performed on medication multi-dose vials or single-dose
vials used in multiple patients, accounted for the respective nosocomial outbreaks.
In the present report, the transmission of HCV in an
outbreak involving three patients attending an endoscopy unit is studied. Two of these patients tested HCV
positive shortly after undergoing colonoscopy. An epidemiological investigation was combined with the use of
molecular biology techniques and genetic and phylogenetic analyses to identify the origin of the outbreak and
the transmission route. This reveals the importance of
viral genetic variability estimates as a valuable complement to epidemiological search.

Results
Epidemiological Investigation

On February 2006, two regular blood donors were independently diagnosed with acute HCV infection. Both
individuals had undergone colonoscopy procedures at
the same endoscopy unit on December 19 th , 2005.
These two patients (C2 and C3) had tested negative for
HCV prior to colonoscopy. Thus, the time of putative
transmission was considered to be comprised between
the last HCV negative test of these patients and the
dates of their onset of symptoms (Figure 1 and Table 1).
The initial wide case-finding investigation focused on
recorded HCV status of patients attending the colonoscopy unit from July 2005 to February 2006 and did not

reveal any suspect of nosocomial infection. Next, a more
limited and detailed case-finding search was carried out
among all attendants to the same endoscopy unit
between December 12th, 2005 and December 26th, 2005.
Apart from the two index cases, 39 patients matched
temporal criteria, but three were excluded due to exitus.
The active search for HCV-infected cases among these
36 eventually exposed patients (30 of which had gone
through colonoscopy and the remaining 6 through gastroscopy) revealed two asymptomatic HCV-positive individuals (C1 and C4). The epidemiological questionnaire
indicated that patient C1, but not patient C4, had also
undergone a colonoscopy on the same day as patients
C2 and C3.
HCV subtypes for patients C1, C2 and C3 were 1b,
while that of C4 was subtype 2c. This patient was considered to be unrelated to the outbreak and was
removed from further analyses. Relevant features and
nosocomial risk factors of patients C1, C2 and C3 are
shown in Table 1. On December, 19th, 6 other patients
had undergone endoscopy diagnosis (3 gastroscopies
and 3 colonoscopies) (Figure1). Data extracted from epidemiological questionnaires (Table 1) strongly indicated
that patient C1 was the likely source of infection of the
two incident cases. One additional patient underwent
gastroscopy between colonoscopies practiced on patients
C1 and C2 (Figure 1) but tested negative for HCV.
The epidemiological investigation focused on determining the transmission route. The procedures that
could have led to patient-to-patient infection were
examined: (a) blood collection and peripheral intravenous line placement and (b) sedation in the endoscopy
room, later followed by colonoscopy. In the former,
usual practices and decision-making about materials

largely depend on the nurse in charge. Patient-nurse
assignment was not recorded although it could be traced
after interviews, and written protocols were not available. In spite of this, interviews to nurses did not reveal
any failure in disinfection standards applied to bloodrelated practices.
The same anaesthesiologist, endoscopist, two nurses
and auxiliary nurse performed anesthesia, colonoscopy
procedure and nurse assistance, respectively, on all
patients that underwent endoscopies on December 19th,
including patients C1, C2 and C3. Written records
documented that these three patients received parentally
midazolam, propofol and anfentanil for anesthetic purposes. The patient that underwent gastroscopy between
colonoscopies practiced on patients C1 and C2 received
propofol and lidocaine. It could not be checked whether
medication vials were multi- or mono-dose and whether
they were used on more than a patient. Written protocols for sedation were not available. Interviews of medical personnel related to sedation procedures did not
reveal any failure in preventive measures of infection.
The endoscopy unit had two colonoscopes, for which
traceability failures were detected in patient assignment
and disinfection records. A registered processing label
recovered from the supply unit of endoscopes along
with data from questionnaires established that patient
order in sedation and colonoscopy was C1, C2 and C3
(Table 1). Biopsy specimens were obtained only from
patient C3 by means of sterilized forceps provided by
the central sterilization unit. Although it was not possible to verify whether the same colonoscope had been
used with patients C1, C2 and C3, examination of
the endoscope disinfection routines could not rule
out this possibility. General standard guidelines for

decontamination included manual cleaning of equipment followed by automatic disinfection. According to
the available written protocol, obstruction of colonoscope channels with gastrointestinal debris could not be
ruled out completely. In this procedure, colonoscope
channels were flushed and rinsed with water and externally washed. After removing the valves, colonoscopes
were immersed in enzymatic detergent and brushed
manually. Individual clearance of all colonoscopy channels was not checked. Next, channels were rinsed with
cleansing solution and introduced into the automaticwasher disinfector. As for the automatic step, correct
disinfection of colonoscopes could not be checked due
to a failure of the printer connected to the disinfection
device. In addition, technical staff members in charge of
colonoscope disinfection had not received specific
training.
Phylogenetic analyses and viral variability

Partial NS5B sequences obtained from patients C1 and
C2 were identical and only differed in three of 337 positions from the sequence corresponding to patient C3.
As a result, the phylogenetic tree of the NS5B region
(Figure 2) showed that patients C1, C2 and C3 clearly
clustered in a monophyletic group among sequences
belonging to HCV subtype 1b (bootstrap support 77%).
The analysis of the NS5B region clearly defined the
extent of the outbreak. As expected in a well-defined
outbreak, the genetic distances between sequences
belonging to patients C1, C2 and C3 were substantially
shorter than those between them and local reference
sequences from epidemiologically unrelated patients
(Figure 2). In addition, another well-supported cluster
also appeared among the reference sequences probably
indicating local epidemiological links between three isolates in the past. Monophyletic clustering of sequences
in the phylogenetic tree of the conserved NS5B region
enabled us to define the patients involved in the outbreak. In order to further characterize the respective
HCV viral populations, the highly variable E1-E2 region
of HCV was analysed.
Thus, sequences from 74 cloned fragments of the E1E2 region, encompassing the hypervariable region
(HVR), were obtained from patients C1, C2 and C3 (26,
28 and 20 sequences respectively). In order to avoid
redundancy, only unique sequences within each patient
were used in phylogenetic analysis. Therefore, a total of
38 sequences (21, 15 and 2 unique sequences from
patients C1, C2 and C3, respectively) were included in
the phylogenetic analysis.
These E1-E2 cloned sequences were analysed along
with 35 local reference sequences from epidemiologically unrelated patients. The resulting phylogenetic tree,
in which only different sequences within patient were

included, is shown in Figure 3. Sequences of clones
from patients involved in the outbreak gave rise to a
well-supported monophyletic group (bootstrap support
80%). Most of the 21 different cloned sequences
obtained from patient C1 were unique and showed relatively short distances from each other. However, two
divergent sequences were also present among the isolated cloned sequences. Patient C2 provided 15 different
cloned sequences, some of which were repeatedly
sampled between 2 and 8 times. All these sequences
mixed with those from the main cluster of patient C1
sequences in the phylogenetic tree (Figure 3). Moreover,
two sequences from patient C1 were also detected in
patient C2 (one was sampled three times and the other
eight times). Finally, patient C3 presented two unique

cloned sequences which grouped in a differentiated cluster (bootstrap support 100%) also located among
sequences of the main cluster of patient C1 sequences,
with one sequence sampled 19 times and the other only
once (Figure 3). In congruence with the phylogenetic
tree of the NS5B region, genetic distances between
E1-E2 sequences from patients C1, C2 and C3 were
much shorter than those between these and the reference sequences.
The outbreak pattern in phylogenetic trees, i. e. monophyletic cluster of outbreak-related sequences, is obvious
in both NS5B and E1-E2 regions. However, due to the
larger number of mutations accumulated in the more
variable E1-E2 region, genetic distances in this portion
of the genome can provide additional information on
how viral populations have emerged in patients involved
in the outbreak. Two additional well-supported clusters
appeared among the reference sequences for the E1-E2
region (Figure 3), probably indicating local epidemiological links involving two and three isolates, respectively.
Intrapatient genetic variability for the E1-E2 region
estimates (Table 2) showed the highest variability for
patient C1 viral population in all parameters (haplotype
diversity, number of polymorphic sites, total number of
mutations, nucleotide diversity and average number of
nucleotide differences between pairs of sequences) followed by lower values for patient C2 and the lowest
genetic variability corresponding to patient C3. For
instance, nucleotide diversity (π) of patient C1 viral
population was one and two orders of magnitude larger
than those of patients C2 and C3, respectively. Therefore, these estimates showed a pronounced decrease in
genetic variability from patient C1 to patient C3
(C1>C2 > C3). In a reconstructed scenario, first, a viral
inoculum from patient C1 was in contact with patient
C2 and later with patient C3. An unidentified factor
could have reduced the remaining viral population after
infecting patient C2, but left enough viral load to cause
infection in patient C3.

Discussion
In the present study, an approach combining epidemiological investigation with a molecular strategy involving
both phylogenetic and genetic variability characterization was implemented to ascertain the most likely explanation for two iatrogenic infections. This report of an
outbreak of two acute HCV among three outpatients,
attending an endoscopy unit on the same day, provides
a case study of nosocomial HCV transmission. Phylogenetic analyses using NS5B and E1-E2 viral regions
clearly defined the extent of the outbreak.
The fact that an HCV negative patient had undergone
gastroscopy between colonoscopies practiced between
patient C1 and C2 along with the fact that all three
HCV-infected patients underwent colonoscopy, led the
investigation to consider colonoscopy, and not gastroscopy, as a risk factor for the outbreak. Hence, common
procedures practiced before gastroscopies and colonoscopies, although fully examined, were considered not to
have played a relevant role in the patient-to-patient
transmission.
Therefore, nosocomial infection occurred during colonoscopy procedure, but the recovered epidemiological
data could not clearly settle whether the transmission
resulted from eventual contamination of medication
vials or incomplete disinfection of colonoscopes. The
lack of information related to vials used in sedation and
the lack of traceability in the use of colonoscopes have
limited our ability to detail how transmission occurred.
A similar dilemma could not be resolved in the pioneering case report of HCV transmission during colonoscopy [11] in which the authors were unable to
completely rule out the possibility that HCV transmission occurred during the anaesthesia procedure previous
to the colonoscopy. Similar uncertainty was also
expressed in other case reports studying HCV transmission during colonoscopy diagnosis [19,20]. However two
recent reports have successfully solved that unsafe injection practices performed with medication vials
accounted for nosocomial infections [17,18]. In fact, several studies have shown that unsafe injection practices
related to anesthesia or intravenous medication are
more often involved in HCV and HBV transmission
than the equipment used in medical procedures with
the patients [10,18]. In this respect, reuse of single or
multiple-dose medication vials on multiple patients
appears as the most common risk factor associated to
minor invasive procedures such as colonoscopies
[17,18]. The strict adherence to disinfection standards
on diagnosis instruments and the application of safe
injection practices fully described elsewhere
[10,17,18,20] would prevent such nosocomial patient-topatient infections definitively.

Page 6 of 9

It has often been observed that, in the absence of
treatment, a viral population from chronically infected
patients tends to gradually accumulate genetically
diverse viral variants over time [21,22]. On the other
hand, a viral population from recently infected patients
tends to display lower genetic diversity than the viral
population from the source [23]. Although viral load of
inoculums, transmission pathway or host factors, such
as susceptibility to infection or a particular immune system response, may play a role in the emergence of viral
populations, the pattern of decreasing variability of viral
populations from source patient to newly infected
patient should be met. Virus sequences isolated from
patient C1 displayed the highest intrapatient variability
in the E1-E2 region, which is a feature of the oldest
infection. Intrapatient variability was lower in patient
C2, while in patient C3 it was minimal, thus matching
the order in which they underwent sedation and colonoscopy. A similar relationship has already been observed
in other nosocomial transmission case of HCV (Bracho,
unpublished results). As the exact route of transmission
could not be ascertained, two alternative hypothesis of
progressive viral load reduction of the infective inoculums can be formulated. If infection occurred via contaminated medication, initial infective virions from
patient C1 could have undergone progressive deterioration in an inappropriate media so that patient C3
received a much more limited representation of the
diversity present in the source viral population than the
previously infected patient (i.e. patient C2). If infection
occurred via colonoscope, the colonoscope contaminated with virions from patient C1 could have undergone two incomplete disinfection cycles. This procedure,
performed after colonoscopy practiced on patient C1
and later on patient C2, could have reduced the viral
population in the colonoscope progressively. Therefore,
independently of the true route of transmission, a
reduction in viral diversity is predicted under both
scenarios.
Thus, these results, in congruence with but independently of the epidemiological investigation, support that
patient C1 was the source of this outbreak and that it is
highly likely that infection to patients C2 and C3
occurred during the colonoscopy procedure. A typical
pattern in phylogenetic trees, the monophyletic clustering of outbreak-related sequences with high bootstrap
support, is often recognized when using consensus
sequences of cases and controls from either conserved
(core, NS5B) or variable regions (E1-E2) of the HCV
genome. These sequences are obtained through direct
sequencing of PCR products and their use is limited to
determining which patients are involved in the putative
outbreak [12,24-27]. Mutations accumulate in viral

González-Candelas et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:217
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/217

populations mainly as a function of time and evolutionary rate, which is substantially larger for hypervariable
regions [28,29]. Hence, genetic distances are larger in
variable regions than in more conserved ones and, when
calculated for intrapatient viral populations, provide a
useful tool for relating genetic variability to the time
elapsed since infection. This is especially the case in the
characterization of recent transmissions [23]. As a consequence, accurate determination of the infection
source, especially in rapidly detected outbreaks, is best
tackled by the phylogenetic analysis of individual (cloned
or end-point diluted) sequences of a fast evolving region
[17,18,30] and complemented with genetic variability
estimation of the intrapatient viral populations [23]. The
combination of these two procedures will improve the
resolution of molecular studies of outbreaks over that of
analyses based only on consensus sequences.

Conclusions
Based on examination of data collected by an epidemiological investigation, and genetic and phylogenetic
results, we conclude that patient-to-patient transmission
probably occurred sequentially during colonoscope procedures. The exact route of transmission, putatively
through intravenous medications or colonoscope, could
not be determined. The comparison of intrapatient viral
genetic variability estimates is proposed as a powerful
tool for tracing HCV transmission. As prevention of
nosocomial transmissions should be a prime concern,
our study contributes to reinforce the importance of
implementing good practices in invasive diagnosis.
Methods
Epidemiological investigation

The newly HCV positivity of the two index patients
after undergoing colonoscopy in a private endoscopy
unit on 19th December, 2005 lead to a retrospective survey to study a possible nosocomial transmission. First, a
wide case-finding investigation included reviewing HCVpositive and negative records from all local Microbiology
Units between January 2004 and February 2006 (eight
hospitals, including the one under study) of patients
that had undergone endoscopy procedures between July
2005 and February 2006 at the endoscopy unit. A second, more limited and detailed search involved all
patients who had attended the endoscopy unit one week
before and after the date considered. This investigation
covered review of clinical records for 39 patients matching temporal criteria. All these patients, except three
due to exitus, were actively contacted, informed about
the possibility of exposure to HCV and tested for antiHCV. The 36 patients completed a detailed epidemiological questionnaire on risk factors for HCV infection
including history of transfusion, intravenous drug use,

piercing, tattooing, acupuncture and suspicion of nosocomial transmission. In order to rule out delayed seroconversion, the six patients that had undergone
colonoscopy or gastroscopy on 19 th December, 2005
and tested negative for HCV in February 2006, were
retested 6 months later. All of them were found to be
anti-HCV negative at that time. Healthcare staff
involved in performing endoscopy (one gastroenterologist, one anesthesiologist, seven nurses and one nurse’s
aide) had negative HCV status in February 2006.
An epidemiological investigation to determine risk
procedures leading to HCV transmission during endoscopies was also carried out. This included a description
of the facilities, review of clinical practices and procedures performed between admission and discharge,
description of staff member qualifications and assessment of disinfection procedures and devices (i.e. observation of endoscopic procedures and endoscopic
reprocessing, and observation of procedures regarding
intravenous line insertion for anaesthetic purposes). All
healthcare workers were interviewed about infectioncontrol practices.
Patients and specimens

Serum samples were obtained from four HCV-infected
patients (C1, C2, C3 and C4) referred to the endoscopy
unit. Samples were taken on February 2006 and stored
frozen at -70°C until processed. Viral load of specimens
was not measured.
RNA extraction and RT-PCR of NS5B and E1-E2 regions

Viral RNA was obtained from 200 μl of serum from
each sample using a High Pure Viral RNA Kit (Roche
Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). Reverse transcriptions (RT) and PCRs were performed as described
in Bracho et al. (2005) [23]. Amplified fragments were
337 and 532-nucleotide-long for NS5B and E1-E2
regions, respectively. Oligonucleotides used for amplification and direct sequencing of the NS5B region were
5’-TATGATACYCGCTGYTTYGACTC-3’ (sense), 5’GTACCTRGTCATAGCCTCCGTGAA-3’ (antisense),
and for the amplification of the E1-E2 region,
5’-CGCATGGCYTGGGAYATGAT-3’ (sense), 5’GGGGTGAARCARTAYACYGG-3’ (antisense), and
hemi-nested 5’-GGGATATGATRATGAAYTGGTC-3’
(sense). A single amplified product for each region was
observed after electrophoresis on a 1.4% agarose gel
stained with ethidium bromide. Amplified products of
the NS5B and E1-E2 regions were purified with High
Pure PCR Product Purification Kit (Roche Diagnostics
GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). The NS5B gene
sequences were obtained directly with the ABI PRISM
BigDye® Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit in an
ABI 3730 (Applied Biosystems Foster City, CA)

automated sequencer and amplification oligonucleotides
as described in Bracho et al. (2005).

variability estimates for the complete set of E1-E2
cloned sequences derived from patients C1, C2 and C3
were obtained with DnaSP v5 [37].

Cloning and sequencing of the E1-E2 region

Amplified fragments of the E1-E2 region, encompassing
HVR1, HVR2 and HVR3 [22], were directly cloned in
EcoRV-digested pBluescript II SK (+) phagemid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Plasmid DNA was purified with a
High Pure Plasmid Isolation kit (Roche). Recombinant
plasmids were sequenced with KS and SK oligonucleotides (Stratagene) as described above.
Phylogenetic and genetic analyses

Partial NS5B sequences were genotyped using HCV
BLAST search at Los Alamos HCV Sequence Database
[31]. NS5B sequences from patients C1, C2, and C3
were analyzed along with a panel of 28 additional local
sequences from epidemiologically unrelated isolates [23],
including NS5B reference sequences for HCV subtype
1b. Accession numbers for the NS5B reference
sequences (EMBL) are shown in Figure 1. Cloned
sequences of the E1-E2 region, corresponding to the
three patients infected with HCV subtype 1b, were analyzed along with 35 reference sequences of HCV subtype 1b. These E1-E2 reference sequences were also
obtained from patients included in the above study [23].
The accession numbers for E1-E2 region reference
sequences are shown in Figure 2. Prior to phylogenetic
analysis of the E1-E2 region, unique cloned sequences
within patient were selected using DAMBE software
[32]. For both HCV genome regions, multiple sequence
alignments were obtained using ClustalX 2.0.10 [33].
Phylogenetic trees were constructed by maximum likelihood with PhyML v3.0 [34] using the nucleotide substitution model that best fitted the data according to
corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) implemented in jModeltest 1.0.1 [35]. The evolutionary model
that best explained the data in the NS5B region corresponded to TIM2 model distance [35], with a gamma
distribution accounting for heterogeneity in evolutionary
rates among sites (shape parameter = 1.034) and a proportion of invariable sites (I = 0.630). The evolutionary
model that best explained the data for the E1-E2 region
corresponded to Tamura-Nei [36], with a gamma distribution accounting for the heterogeneity in evolutionary
rates among sites (shape parameter = 0.737) and a proportion of invariable sites (I = 0.273). In addition, a parallel analysis was carried out with E1-E2 cloned
sequences from local reference patients instead of the
corresponding consensus sequences, but the maximum
likelihood tree yielded similar results (data not shown).
Robustness of the clades derived in the phylogenetic
trees was assessed by bootstrap analysis using 1000
pseudo-replicates as implemented in PhyML. Genetic

Nucleotide sequence accession numbers

The HCV sequences obtained in this study have been
deposited in GenBank under accession numbers [EMBL:
FM881903 to EMBL:FM881906] for NS5B region
sequences and [EMBL:FM955149 to EMBL:FM955222]
for clones of the E1-E2 region.
