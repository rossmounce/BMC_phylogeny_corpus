Abstract
Background: The Sydney blood bank cohort (SBBC) of long-term survivors consists of multiple
individuals infected with nef-deleted, attenuated strains of human immunodeficiency virus type 1
(HIV-1). Although the cohort members have experienced differing clinical courses and now
comprise slow progressors (SP) as well as long-term nonprogressors (LTNP), longitudinal analysis
of nef/long-terminal repeat (LTR) sequences demonstrated convergent nef/LTR sequence evolution
in SBBC SP and LTNP. Thus, the in vivo pathogenicity of attenuated HIV-1 strains harboured by
SBBC members is dictated by factors other than nef/LTR. Therefore, to determine whether defects
in other viral genes contribute to attenuation of these HIV-1 strains, we characterized dominant
HIV-1 rev alleles that persisted in 4 SBBC subjects; C18, C64, C98 and D36.
Results: The ability of Rev derived from D36 and C64 to bind the Rev responsive element (RRE)
in RNA binding assays was reduced by approximately 90% compared to Rev derived from HIV-1NL43, C18 or C98. D36 Rev also had a 50–60% reduction in ability to express Rev-dependent reporter
constructs in mammalian cells. In contrast, C64 Rev had only marginally decreased Rev function
despite attenuated RRE binding. In D36 and C64, attenuated RRE binding was associated with rare
amino acid changes at 3 highly conserved residues; Gln to Pro at position 74 immediately Nterminal to the Rev activation domain, and Val to Leu and Ser to Pro at positions 104 and 106 at
the Rev C-terminus, respectively. In D36, reduced Rev function was mapped to an unusual 13
amino acid extension at the Rev C-terminus.
Conclusion: These findings provide new genetic and mechanistic insights important for Rev
function, and suggest that Rev function, not Rev/RRE binding may be rate limiting for HIV-1
replication. In addition, attenuated rev alleles may contribute to viral attenuation and long-term
survival of HIV-1 infection in a subset of SBBC members.

Background
The Sydney blood bank cohort (SBBC) of long-term survivors (LTS) consists of multiple individuals who became
infected with attenuated strains of human immunodeficiency type 1 (HIV-1) via contaminated blood products
from a common blood donor between 1981 and 1984 [13]. Long-term prospective studies showed convergent evolution of nef/long-terminal repeat (LTR) sequences in
virus harbored by SBBC members, characterized by progressive sequence deletions toward a minimal nef/LTR
structure retaining only sequence elements required for
viral replication [4]. Thus, gross deletions in the nef/LTR
region of the HIV-1 genome contribute to viral attenuation and slow progression of HIV-1 infection in SBBC
members. Despite convergent nef/LTR sequence evolution, after 22 to 26 years of infection SBBC members comprise antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naïve long-term
nonprogressors (LTNP) as well as slow progressors (SP)
who eventually commenced ART, suggesting that other
viral and/or host factors may contribute to the in vivo
pathogenicity (or lack thereof) of SBBC HIV-1 strains
[3,4].
Numerous viral and host factors have been shown to
affect the rate of HIV-1 disease progression [reviewed in
[5-7]]. Viral genetic factors other than nef/LTR associated
with SP or LTNP include mutations in the HIV-1 gag, rev,
vif, vpr, vpu and env genes [8-13]. Host genetic factors
linked to a delay in the onset of AIDS and prolonged survival include the CCR5 Δ32 mutation, CCR2-V64I polymorphism, and certain HLA haplotypes [14-17].
HIV-1 Rev is a 116 amino acid (aa), ~18 kD regulatory
protein whose primary function is to mediate the nucleocytoplasmic transport, and therefore expression, of
unspliced and singly spliced HIV-1 mRNA transcripts
encoding viral structural proteins, via binding to the Rev
response element (RRE) which is a complex RNA stemloop structure present in these transcripts [reviewed in
[[18-21]]. Therefore, Rev activity is essential for HIV-1 replication. Extensive mutational analysis of Rev has identified 2 distinct functional domains [reviewed in [21]].
These include an arginine-rich N-terminal region at aa
positions 34 to 50 which contains the nuclear localization
signal (NLS) and the RNA-binding domain (RBD) that
mediates direct binding of Rev to the RRE, and a highly
conserved leucine-rich C-terminal activation domain at aa
positions 75 to 83 which contains the nuclear export signal (NES). The N-terminal NLS/RBD is flanked on both
sides by less well defined sequences that are required for
multimerization [22-25].
A previous study of rev alleles isolated from a subject with
long-term nonprogressive HIV-1 infection showed a persistent Leu to Ile change at position 78 in the activation

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/4/1/43

domain which attenuated Rev function and HIV-1 replication capacity [10], providing the first evidence that defective rev alleles may contribute to long-term survival of
HIV-1 infection in some patients. A subsequent study of
naturally occurring rev alleles with rare sequence variations in the activation domain showed variable reductions in Rev activity [26], although it was unclear from
this study whether the reductions in Rev activity observed
would be sufficient to attenuate HIV-1 replication capacity. In the present study, we undertook a genetic and functional analysis of HIV-1 rev alleles isolated from 4 SBBC
subjects to determine whether defects in viral genes other
than nef/LTR contribute to attenuation of HIV-1 strains
harbored by SBBC members.

Results and Discussion
Subjects
The clinical history of the study subjects, results of laboratory studies and antiretroviral therapies have been
described in detail previously [3,4,27]. The results of laboratory studies relevant for the longitudinal samples used
in this study are summarized in Table 1. Briefly, D36
acquired HIV-1 sexually in December 1980. C18, C64 and
C98 acquired HIV-1 by receiving blood products donated
by D36 in August 1983, April 1983 and February 1982,
respectively. After 19 years of asymptomatic infection
without ART, D36 was placed on highly active ART
(HAART) in January 1999 after evidence of HIV-1 progression. C98 was also placed on HAART in November 1999
after 18 years of HIV-1 infection, and died of causes unrelated to HIV-1 in March 2001. C64 has been infected for
24 years without ART, and has stable CD4 T-cells and
below detectable viral load. C18 died of causes unrelated
to HIV-1 in November 1995, but prior to death was
asymptomatic with stable CD4 T-cell count for 12 years
without ART. Thus, D36 and C98 are SP, and C18 and
C64 are LTNP [3,4]. CCR5Δ32 genotyping by PCR
showed that all subjects carried CCR5 (wt/wt) alleles
([28], and J. S. Sullivan, personal communication).
CCR2-64I genotyping by PCR-RFLP showed that C64 and
C98 carried the CCR2-64I (wt/wt) genotype [28]. The
CCR2-64I genotype of C18 and D36 has not been determined.
Persistence of unique rev alleles in SBBC members
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated
from blood samples longitudinally collected on 4 occasions between 1995 and 2001 were available from D36,
C64 and C98 for this study (Table 1). Only one blood
sample collected in 1993 was available from C18. Blood
was taken from subjects in accordance with guidelines
endorsed by the Australian Red Cross Blood Service
human ethics committee. Multiple, independent fulllength Rev clones containing the first and second Rev coding exons were generated from genomic DNA of each

PBMC sample and sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis
showed that all Rev sequences were clade B (data not
shown). The dominant Rev aa sequence from each PBMC
sample, which represents the consensus sequence from 10
independent clones, is shown in Additional file 1. In each
subject where longitudinal PBMC samples were available
(D36, C64 and C98), the persistence of a dominant rev
allele was evident over a 4- to 6-year period. Figure 1
shows an aa sequence alignment of these dominant and
persistent rev alleles as well as the dominant rev allele in
the single C18 PBMC sample. Single aa changes at positions 74, 104, 106, 108 and 112 in sequence encoding Rev
exon 2 segregated the dominant C18 and C98 Revs from
the dominant C64 and D36 Revs. However, each dominant Rev sequence contained unique, distinguishing aa
changes. In addition, C18, C64 and C98 Revs had a 3 aa
extension at the Rev C-terminus, and D36 Revs had a 13
aa extension at this position. Similar C-terminal extensions were not identified in 164 Rev sequences available
in the Los Alamos data base and other published studies
[10]. Thus, the dominant and persistent Revs harbored by
these SBBC members are unique. The following studies
functionally characterized Rev proteins derived from
these dominant and persistent SBBC rev alleles.

Rev proteins derived from subjects C64 and D36 have
attenuated RRE binding capacity
The ability of His-tagged Rev proteins derived from the
dominant and persistent SBBC rev alleles to bind the RRE
was quantified by electrophoretic mobility shift assays
with [32P]-labelled RNA transcripts bearing the RRE (Fig.
2A). His-tagged Rev and Matrix proteins derived from
HIV-1NL4-3 were used as positive and negative controls,
respectively. Compared to His-tagged Rev from HIV-1NL43, the ability of His-tagged Revs from D36 and C64 to
form Rev/RRE complexes at non-saturating Rev concentrations (0.25 μM) was reduced by approximately 90%
(Fig. 2B). In contrast, the ability of His-tagged Revs from
C18 and C98 to form Rev/RRE complexes at non-saturating Rev concentrations was similar to His-tagged Rev from
HIV-1NL4-3. These results indicate that Rev proteins
derived from the dominant and persistent D36 and C64
rev alleles have attenuated ability to bind the RRE.
Rev amino acid sequences associated with attenuated RRE
binding
Attenuated RRE binding was not due to mutations in the
N-terminal RBD, since the amino acid sequences across
this region were conserved among all SBBC rev alleles and
were identical to HIV-1NL4-3 (Fig. 1). This was somewhat
surprising, since previous studies showed that the RBD of
Rev was the principal determinant of RRE binding [2325,29-32]. The C-terminal 3 aa extensions present in C18,

Amino acid sequences of persistent and dominant SBBC rev alleles

Amino acid sequences of persistent and dominant SBBC rev alleles. The HIV-1 Rev amino acid sequences shown represent those derived from the dominant and persistent rev alleles harboured by SBBC subjects C18, C64, C98 and D36. They
are the consensus sequences of multiple independent Rev clones that persisted over a 4- to 6-year period in C64, C98 and
D36, or which were dominant in a single blood sample obtained from C18 [see Additional file 1]. Amino acid alignments are
compared to Rev from HIV-1NL4-3. Dots indicate residues identical to HIV-1NL4-3 Rev, and dashes indicate gaps. Boxed residues
indicate amino acid substitutions which discriminate C18 and C98 Revs from C64 and D36 Revs. NLS; nuclear localization signal, RBD; RNA binding domain, NES; nuclear export signal.

C64 and C98 Revs (Fig. 1) had no effect on RRE binding,
since RRE binding by C18 and C98 Revs was similar to
HIV-1NL4-3. Three amino acid changes that were conserved
among D36 and C64 rev alleles and that were not present
in C18 and C98 rev alleles were identified outside the
RBD; Gln to Pro at position 74 immediately N-terminal to
the Rev activation domain, and Val to Leu and Ser to Pro
at positions 104 and 106 at the Rev C-terminus, respectively (Fig. 1). Amino acid changes also occurred at positions 108 and 112 which segregated C64 and D36 Revs
from C18 and C98 Revs, but database analysis showed
that amino acid variation is frequent at these positions
(data not shown). Thus, amino acid changes at positions
108 and 112 are not likely to affect Rev/RRE binding. In
contrast, the clade B consensus residues Gln-74, Val-104
and Ser-106 are normally highly conserved, with residue
frequencies of 0.90, 0.94 and 0.97, respectively (Table 2).
Pro-74, Leu-104 and Pro-106 are rare amino acid changes
among clade B Revs; Only 16 rev alleles from 164
sequences available in the Los Alamos data base and other
published studies [10] had Pro-74, Leu-104 or Pro-106,

with individual residue frequencies of 0.049, 0.018 and
0.018, respectively (Table 2). The frequency of any 2 of
these residues being present was 0.006. None of the available sequences had all 3 amino acid changes. Thus, the
amino acid changes occurring in D36 and C64 Revs are
unique. However, the presence of one or more of these
amino acid changes was not able to discriminate between
subjects with progressive or non-progressive HIV-1 infection (Table 2). Moreover, none of these amino acid
changes occurred in a previously identified LTNP with
defective rev alleles [patient MA [10], Table 2]. Thus, the
contribution of any or all of these mutations to decreased
RRE binding by D36 and C64 Revs, and possibly to slow
or absent HIV-1 progression, is likely to be context
dependent. Further mutagenesis studies are required to
determine the contribution of Pro-74, Leu-104 or Pro-106
to diminished RRE binding by these Rev variants.
Rev is a highly structured protein [reviewed in [20,21]].
Biochemical and structural studies identified an α-helix at
aa 8 to 26, and another at aa 34 to 59 spanning the NLS/

Analysis 2 Rev/RRE binding
Analysis of Rev/RRE binding. RNA binding assays were conducted with [32P]-labelled RRE riboprobes and increasing concentrations of His-tagged Rev proteins, as described in Materials and Methods. Binding reactions containing increasing concentrations of His-tagged Matrix protein from HIV-1NL4-3 were included as negative controls. Rev/RRE complexes were resolved
by electrophoresis in 5% (wt/vol) native polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography (A). Bands were quantified by
phosphorimager analysis, and the percentage of RNA binding was calculated by dividing the signal intensity of bands associated
with Rev/RRE complexes by the signal intensity of all bands, and multiplying this number by 100 (B). The data shown are representative of three independent experiments. *p < 0.01, Student's t test.

RBD, separated by a Pro-rich region at aa 27 to 39, which
folds into a helix-loop-helix structure where intramolecular contacts between the 2 α-helices are facilitated by
hydrophobic interactions [reviewed in [20]]. The Rev RBD
within the latter α-helix interacts specifically with an
internal loop of the RRE through major groove interactions [33]. The C-terminal region of Rev is thought to be
more flexible. However, a discontinuous epitope of a Revspecific monoclonal antibody was mapped to aa 10 to 20
and 95 to 105 by protein foot printing, suggesting that the
α-helices are in close proximity to the Rev C-terminus
[34,35], and suggesting a role for the C-terminus in stabilizing native Rev structure. Thus, aa changes occurring at
the Rev C-terminus or elsewhere such as Pro-74, Leu-104
and/or Pro-106 could potentially affect Rev structure and
thus, Rev/RRE binding. Proline provides exceptional conformational rigidity to proteins. Thus, It is possible that
Pro-74 and/or Pro-106 may impede RRE binding by altering native Rev structure.

Rev derived from D36, but not C64, has impaired function
To determine whether SBBC Revs have impaired function,
D36, C64, C18 and C98 Revs were subcloned into the
pcDNA3.1 expression vector. Western blot analysis of Rev
protein expression using sheep polyclonal anti-Rev antiserum showed equivalent levels of Rev in lysates of transfected CEM cells (Fig. 3A). Rev function in mammalian
cells was investigated using the Rev-dependent reporter
plasmid pDM128 [31], which expresses the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene in the presence of
Rev, as described previously [36] (Fig. 3B). In this assay,
the Rev expression plasmids were first titrated to determine an amount to use that was within the linear
response range of the assay (data not shown). Levels of
CAT activity were compared to those present in lysates of
cells co-transfected with pDM128 and HIV-1NL4-3 Rev.
Cells cotransfected with pDM128 and empty pcDNA3.1
vector or pcDNA3.1 expressing HIV-1NL4-3 Matrix protein
were included as negative controls. Levels of CAT activity

in lysates of cells transfected with C18 or C98 Revs were
not significantly different to those in lysates of cells transfected with HIV-1NL4-3 Rev. In contrast, levels of CAT activity in lysates of cells transfected with C64 or D36 Revs
were reduced by approximately 20% and 50%, respectively (P < 0.01). Similar results were obtained using 293
cells (data not shown). In addition, similar results were
obtained using a Rev-dependent HIV-1 env reporter system as a measure of Rev function, as described previously
[37] (data not shown). These data suggest efficient Rev
function by C18 and C98 Revs, a modest reduction in the
activity of C64 Rev, but significant impairment in the
activity of D36 Rev.
Amino acid sequences associated with impaired D36 Rev
function
Efficient C18 and C98 Rev function is consistent with
results of the Rev/RRE binding studies that showed efficient RRE binding by these Revs (Fig. 2). However, the
modest or significant impairment in C64 or D36 Rev
activity, respectively, is discrepant with results of the Rev/
RRE binding studies that showed equivalent reductions in
RRE binding by these Rev variants (Fig. 2). Therefore, in
C64 Rev, the reduced levels of RRE binding appear to be
sufficient for the majority of Rev function to be retained.

Additional sequence changes that differentiate C64 and
D36 Revs are likely to impair D36 Rev function. Longitudinal sequence analysis showed that the presence of an
unusual 13 aa extension at the D36 Rev C-terminus was
the only genetic alteration that consistently differentiated
D36 Rev from C64 Rev (Fig. 1), [see also Additional file
1]. The otherwise isogenicity of the D36 and C64 Revs
used in the functional studies identifies the C-terminal 13
aa extension as the primary determinant underlying
impaired D36 Rev function.
It is presently unclear how this sequence alteration may
affect D36 Rev function, but the additional 13 aa at the
Rev C-terminus may affect Rev structure. One hypothesis
is that such structural changes may interfere with the
recruitment of cellular proteins to the NES such as eIF-5A
[38], nucleoporins including Rip/Rab [39-43] and CRM1/
exportin 1 [44-46], which could potentially affect nuclear
export. The presence of Pro at position 74 immediately Nterminal to the Rev NES may induce further structural
changes contributing to this interference, which might
also account for the modest reduction in C64 Rev activity.
Further studies are required to fully elucidate the importance of amino acid alterations that impair D36 Rev function.

alleles. This genetic alteration may alter structural properties of Rev that are required for optimal Rev function.
Together, our data suggest that Rev function, not Rev/RRE
binding may be rate limiting for HIV-1 replication.

Conclusion
In this study, we demonstrate reduced capacity of persistent and dominant Rev variants isolated from a subset of
SBBC members to bind the RRE, which was associated
with unique rev alleles carrying rare amino acid substitutions at 3 highly conserved positions outside the RBD; Gln
to Pro at position 74 immediately N-terminal to the Rev
activation domain, and Val to Leu and Ser to Pro at positions 104 and 106 at the Rev C-terminus, respectively.
However, decreases in Rev/RRE binding per se were not
sufficient to attenuate Rev function. This conclusion is
supported by studies of C64 Rev, which had significantly
reduced RRE binding but only modestly reduced Rev
function. Additional sequence changes present in D36
Rev attenuated Rev function. This was mapped to an unusual 13 aa extension at the Rev C-terminus, which was the
only genetic change that distinguished C64 and D36 rev

It is presently unclear whether attenuated D36 Rev function in vitro equates to attenuated Rev function in vivo, and
indeed whether attenuated Rev function contributed to
slow progression of HIV-1 infection in this subject.
Extrapolation of these in vitro findings to an in vivo role for
attenuated D36 rev alleles is difficult, since this subject
and other SBBC members are infected with virus containing gross nef/LTR deletions which have been shown to
contribute significantly to viral attenuation in this cohort
[1,4,27]. Furthermore, the attenuated properties of D36
and C64 Revs did not distinguish SBBC LTNP from SP. In
fact, among the SBBC subjects studied here, D36 had the
most attenuated rev alleles yet the most progressive HIV-1
infection, suggesting that any effect that attenuated rev
alleles may have in vivo is likely to be dependent on other
viral and/or host factors. Nonetheless, our results support
those of a previous study that showed attenuated Rev
function in an asymptomatic individual [10], and those of
another study that showed reduced Rev function among
rev alleles with naturally occurring sequence variations
[26], raising the possibility that attenuated Rev function
may contribute, at least in part, to viral attenuation and
slow HIV-1 progression in D36. However, in contrast to
these studies where attenuated Rev function was mapped
to mutations in the activation domain [10,26], attenuated
Rev function in D36 was mapped to the Rev C-terminus.
In sum, these findings provide new genetic and mechanistic insights important for Rev function. In addition, attenuated rev alleles may contribute to viral attenuation and
long-term survival of HIV-1 infection in a subset of SBBC
members. A better understanding of viral determinants
other than nef/LTR that contribute to HIV-1 pathogenicity
(or lack thereof) in SBBC members may provide additional mechanistic insights important for controlling HIV1 infection in vivo.

Methods
Rev cloning and sequencing
Full-length HIV-1 Rev clones containing the first and second Rev coding exons were generated from genomic DNA
of patient PBMC samples by PCR using Expand high fidelity DNA polymerase (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) as follows; The first Rev coding exon was amplified
using primers 5RevE2 (5'-GGGTGTCGACATAGCAGAATAG-3'; corresponding to nt positions 5781 to 5802
of HIV-1NL4-3) and 3RevE2 (5'-CTGCTTTGATAGAGAAGCTTG-3'; corresponding to nt positions 6024 to
6044 of HIV-1NL4-3) that spans a SalI restriction site 5' to
the Rev start codon. The second Rev coding exon was

amplified using primers 5RevE3 (5'-CCACCTCCCAATCCCGAGGGG-3'; corresponding to nt positions 8371 to
8391 of HIV-1NL4-3) and 3RevE3 (5'-CTAGGTCTCGAGATACTGCTC-3'; corresponding to nt positions 8879 to
8898 of HIV-1NL4-3) that spans an XhoI restriction site 3' to
the Rev stop codon. To avoid sequence resampling, six
independent PCRs of Rev exon 1 or Rev exon 2 coding
sequence were pooled prior to 3-way ligation in pGEM
(Promega, Madison, WI) using SalI and XhoI restriction
sites and blunt end ligation to link the Rev exon 1 and Rev
exon 2 coding sequences.
Ten independent Revs cloned from each PBMC sample
were sequenced using a SequiTherm EXCEL II DNA
sequencing kit (Epicenter Technologies, Madison, WI)
and a model 4000L LI-COR DNA sequencer (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE). Predicted aa sequences were deduced from
nucleotide sequences, and aligned and analyzed using
DNAMAN software (Lynnon, Quebec, Canada).

at 72 h post-transfection and assayed for CAT activity as
described previously [36].
Western blot analysis
Lysates were prepared from CEM cells that were transfected as described above, separated in 12% (wt/vol) SDSpolyacrylamide gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes, as described previously [37]. Blots were
probed with a 1:500 dilution of sheep anti-Rev polyclonal
antisera (ICN). Rev proteins were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-sheep immunoglobulin G antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence
(Promega).
Nucleotide accession numbers
The rev nucleotide sequences reported here have been
assigned GenBank accession numbers EF634153 to
EF634156.

Rev/RRE binding assays
His-tagged Rev proteins derived from SBBC rev alleles
were produced, purified and quantified using the pET bacterial expression system (Novagen, Madison, WI), according to the manufacturers' protocol. The ability of Histagged Rev proteins to bind the RRE was quantified by
electrophoretic mobility shift assays with [32P]-labelled
RNA transcripts bearing the RRE, as described previously
[47]. Briefly, binding reactions consisted of excess [32P]labelled RNA and increasing concentrations of His-tagged
Rev protein (0, 0.05, 0.25, 0.40 or 0.50 μM) in 10 μl binding buffer [10 mM HEPES/KOH (pH 7.6), 150 mM KCl, 2
mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 20%
(vol/vol) glycerol, 3.2 μg E. coli tRNA]. Reactions were
incubated on ice for 10 min, then applied to 5% (wt/vol)
nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels containing 100 mM
Tris borate (pH 8.3), 1 mM EDTA, and 3% (vol/vol) glycerol and run at 4°C followed by autoradiography and
phosphorimager analysis.
Rev function assays
To facilitate Rev protein expression in mammalian cells,
SBBC rev alleles were subcloned into the pcDNA3.1
expression vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Rev function in mammalian cells was quantified using the Revdependent reporter plasmid pDM128, which expresses
the CAT gene from an intron bearing the RRE in the presence of HIV-1 Rev [31]. Briefly, CEM cells were cotransfected with 4.0 μg pDM128, 0.75 μg pcDNA.1-Rev
plasmid and 0.25 μg pEGFP plasmid to control for transfection efficiency. The Rev expression plasmids were
titrated first to determine an amount to use that was
within the linear response range of the assay (data not
shown). After minor volume adjustments for small variations in transfection efficiency, cell lysates were prepared
