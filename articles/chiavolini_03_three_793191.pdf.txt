Abstract
Background: Streptococcus pneumoniae possesses large zinc metalloproteinases on its surface. To
analyse the importance in virulence of three of these metalloproteinases, intranasal challenge of
MF1 outbred mice was carried out using a range of infecting doses of wild type and knock-out
pneumococcal mutant strains, in order to compare mice survival.
Results: Observation of survival percentages over time and detection of LD50s of knock out
mutants in the proteinase genes in comparison to the type 4 TIGR4 wild type strain revealed two
major aspects: i) Iga and ZmpB, present in all strains of S. pneumoniae, strongly contribute to
virulence in mice; (ii) ZmpC, only present in about 25% of pneumococcal strains, has a lower
influence on virulence in mice.
Conclusions: These data suggest Iga, ZmpB and ZmpC as candidate surface proteins responsible
for pneumococcal infection and potentially involved in distinct stages of pneumococcal disease.

Background
Streptococcus pneumoniae is an important human pathogen
responsible for community acquired pneumonia, as well
as meningitis, sepsis and milder infections like otitis
media [1]. The principal factors involved in the pathogenicity of S. pneumoniae are the capsule and pneumococcal surface proteins and enzymes such as PspA, PspC,
neuraminidase, pneumolysin and hyaluronidase [2–4]. A
characteristic feature of S. pneumoniae and other oral streptococci is the presence of large proteases (1800–2001
amino acids) on the cell surface. Except for one serine protease, these enzymes are zinc metalloproteinases and are
thought of contributing to the virulence of S. pneumoniae.
The published genome sequences show that S. pneumoniae
possesses two to four zinc metalloproteinases depending

on the strain [5–8]. The best characterized of these
enzymes is Iga which cleaves human IgA1 in the hinge
region [9–12]. IgA1 protease was found to be important
in lung infection and sepsis following large-scale virulence factor identification studies [13,14] and in in vitro
studies performed on epithelial cells [15]. IgA proteases
are common to a variety of bacteria, including Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus sanguis, Neisseria meningitidis,
Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae, Prevotella
melaninogenica, Capnocytophaga spp [10,16–18]. The second pneumococcal zinc metalloproteinase with an
assigned function is ZmpC, which was recently shown to
specifically cleave human matrix metalloproteinase 9
(MMP-9) [5] and to participate in pneumococcal pathogenicity in an experimental mouse model of intranasal

challenge and sepsis [5,13,14]. This role links ZmpC to
the group of bacterial proteases [19] involved in disruption of extracellular matrix and tissue destruction and
invasion. No specific function has yet been described for
ZmpB [20], although a knockout mutant devoid of zmpB
was recently shown to be significantly attenuated in
murine models of pneumonia and sepsis [21].
Molecular epidemiological data obtained through
sequencing and probe screening (including microarray)
[10,15,22] evidence that the pneumococcal, and the
related streptococcal, zinc metalloproteinases evolve in a
mosaic like fashion. None of these studies links the presence or absence or the variability of these genes to clinical
disease. Genome sequences evidence that Iga (IgA protease) and ZmpB are present in three out of three strains,
while ZmpC is missing in R6 [6–8]. Our own recent survey of presence of ZmpC in clinical isolates showed that
the zmpC gene is present in 26% of strains and that its
presence is linked to isolates from pneumonia [19].
Large scale studies, carried out to identify virulence genes
in S. pneumoniae, report different results concerning surface zinc metalloproteinases. None of these enzymes
seems to be important in a serotype 3 strain virulence
[23], two of them are reported to be important in the virulence of a type 19F strain [13] and all three appear to
play an important role in the virulence of a type 4 strain
[14]. In the present work, we conducted intranasal challenge studies, using ten fold dilutions of infecting doses
just above the LD50 of the wild type strain, to compare the
role in pathogenesis of the three zinc metalloproteinases
(Iga, ZmpB and ZmpC) present in the encapsulated S.
pneumoniae type 4 TIGR4 strain [6].

Results
Construction of mutants
For the in vivo challenge SP0071/zmpC, SP0664/zmpB
and SP1154/iga mutants of the capsulated TIGR4 strain
were constructed by direct transformation of PCR products containing antibiotic resistance cassettes. These DNA
products were obtained from mutants previously constructed in a rough type 4 derivative [5]. Parameters relating to transformation efficiency and the specific
constructs are shown in Table 1. In the case of the
∆SP0071/zmpC mutant FP122 a cat gene (chloramphenicol acetyl tranferase) [24] substitutes for SP0071 (Table
1), in the case of the ∆SP0664/zmpB mutant FP173 the
ermB gene (erythromycin resistance methylase B) substitutes for SP0664, and in the case of the ∆SP1154/iga
mutant FP174 the spe gene (spectinomycin resistance
conferring aad-9 gene) [24] substitutes for SP0664 (Table
1). Neither of the three proteinases genes was observed to
be essential for in vitro growth, and no changes in dou-

bling time or final density of the culture were detected in
these encapsulated mutants.
In order to evidence that the three proteinases of TIGR4
effectively represent the major subgroups of streptococcal
zinc metalloproteinases a tree diagram was constructed
(Figure 1). Due to the mosaic nature of pneumococcal
genes [5,18,22,25] and the low conservation in primary
sequence between the different proteinases [5], only a
region of 180 amino acids surrounding the proteinase
active site was considered when generating the treefile.
The diagram in Figure 1 clearly demonstrates that the
three proteinases of TIGR4 belong to the three major
branches of the tree representing the zinc metalloproteinase of pneumococci and other oral streptococci sequenced
so far.
Survival of mice is improved following induction of
pneumonia with zinc metalloproteinase knock-out
mutants of TIGR4 pneumococcal strain
In order to analyse the role of the three zinc metalloproteinases in pneumococcal disease, groups of 6–12 mice
were infected intranasally with 105, 106 and 107 CFU of
the TIGR4 wild type strain and the isogenic mutants
FP122 (∆zmpC), FP173 (∆zmpB) and FP174 (∆iga). As
shown in figure 2A, at the dose of 107 CFU survival of
mice infected with ∆zmpC and ∆zmpB mutant strains over
time was slightly improved with respect to the wild type,
although these differences were not statistically significant. The ∆iga mutant did not show any attenuation in virulence following infection at the highest dose. The most
remarkable differences were detected at the dose of 106
CFU (figure 2B). The ∆zmpC mutant strain showed a significant (P = 0.002, Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test) reduction in virulence over time in comparison to the TIGR4
parent strain [5] (figure 2B). All mice inoculated with the
zmpB and iga mutant strains showed no clinical symptoms and were all healthy and alive at end of the study
(figure 2B), in contrast to animals infected with wild type
pneumococci, which developed sepsis after intranasal
infection. Differences in survival were found to be significant (P = 0.0003 for both Iga and ZmpB mutant strains in
comparison to TIGR4). Following infection with 105 CFU,
survival percentage of mice infected with the zmpC mutant
was 66.6% compared to 50% of control mice at the end of
the experiment (difference not statistically significant).
Also at 105 CFU, no mice inoculated by the intranasal
route with zmpB and iga mutants showed any disease
symptoms (figure 2C). Differences in survival between
mice receiving the two mutant strains and the ones
infected with the wild type were not quite significant (P =
0.074). The data on disease outcome at the infecting dose
of 106 with the zmpC mutant (filled triangles of Panel B in
Figure 2) have been previously reported separately [5].

Unrooted radial tree of streptococcal zinc metalloproteinases
Unrooted radial tree of streptococcal zinc metalloproteinases: The tree diagram of streptococcal zinc metalloproteinases was drawn to visualise to which group the diverse proteinases of strain TIGR4 belong to. The major clusters formed by
the zinc metalloproteinases of the oral streptococci are circled. The three enzymes of strain TIGR4, whose deletion mutants
are assayed in this work, are boxed. Even if streptococcal zinc metalloproteinases evolve by horizontal gene transfer and show
evident mosaic like structure, a fact questioning phylogenic analysis, a tree was drawn to show the major grouping of these
enzymes. A stretch of 180 amino acids surrounding the active site of the streptococcal zinc metalloproteinases available from
GenBank [5–8], TIGR and Sanger Centre were aligned with ClustalX using standard parameters and the tree was visualised
using TreeView. S. pneumoniae proteins are preceded by Sp and the serotype. Proteins of the unfinished genomes of serotype
6 (TIGR) and 23F (Sanger Centre) are named as homologs referring to the published pneumococcal enzymes. The proteins
derived from the unfinished genomes of S. gordonii and S. mitis (both TIGR) are denominated according to the respective contigs (last accessed January 27th 2003).

Virulence of pneumococcal zinc metalloproteinase mutants at different doses of intranasal challenge
Figure 2
Virulence of pneumococcal zinc metalloproteinase mutants at different doses of intranasal challenge: Mice
were infected intranasally (i.n.) with different doses: panel (A) 107 CFU/mouse, panel (B) 106 CFU/mouse, and panel (C) 105
CFU/mouse. Bacterial strains were TIGR4 (open circles, n = 12 for 106 CFU and n = 6 for 107 and 105 CFU), ∆zmpC (solid triangles, n = 12 for 106 CFU and n = 6 for 107 and 105 CFU), ∆zmpB (open diamonds, n = 6) and ∆iga (crosses, n = 6) mutants.
Animals were observed for 8 days. Results are expressed as percentage of mice surviving intranasal challenge and subsequent
sepsis over time. Statistical analysis (Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon U Test) was performed considering the time point when mice
died (P < 0.01). For statistical purposes, animals still alive after 8 days were assigned a time to death of 192 h. The data referring to the 106 CFU inoculum of the ∆zmpC mutant were already reported in reference [5] combined to bacteremia levels.

Figure 3 shows survival increase of animals infected with
IgA protease mutant strains at three different doses. Differences in LD50 between mice infected with TIGR4 and mice
infected with the three mutant strains were observed.
Infection with zmpB and iga mutants enabled the detection of an LD50 of 3.6 × 106 CFU in MF1 mice (Figure 3B
and 3C) while the one observed following infection with
the zmpC mutant was calculated as 4.7 × 105 CFU, compared to 105 CFU detected for the parent strain (Figure
3A). This indicates a 36-fold reduction in virulence for
zmpB and iga mutants and only a 4.7-fold reduction for
the zmpC mutant compared to TIGR4. Significant differences in survival between zmpB and iga strains and TIGR4
were detected at the dose of 106 CFU (P = 0.0022, Fisher's
exact test) but not at 105 CFU (P = 0.18). In the case of the
zmpC mutant the difference in comparison to the parent
strain was significant at 106 CFU (P = 0.037), but not at
105 CFU (P = 0.6).

Discussion
The cell surface is the prime interface between any microorganism and the host. A total of 23 proteins of over 1500
amino acids are present in the three published pneumococcal genome sequences (7–8 proteins / genome) [6–8]
and all of these proteins, except one (DNA methylase of a
conjugative transposon), are surface located. Out of these
22 large surface located proteins, 12 are proteinases (2–4
zinc metalloproteinases and one serine proteinase /
genome), 7 are involved in cleavage of carbohydrates (3
acetylglucosaminidases, 3 beta-galactosidases and an
uncharacterised glycosyl hydrolase) and 3 are of unknown
function. Extracellular zinc metalloproteinase are recognised to be important virulence determinants of several
human pathogens, acting on target cells as intracellular
toxins, as in Bacillus anthracis (lethal factor) [26], Clostridium botulinum (neurotoxin) [27], Clostridium tetani (neurotoxin) [27], or as extracellular toxins, as in Pseudomonas
aeruginosa (pseudolysin, elastase, neutral metalloproteinase) [28], Staphylococcus aureus (aureolysin, neutral proteinase) [29], Vibrio cholerae (hemagglutinin/proteinase,
vibriolysin) [30], and Listeria monocytogenes [31]. Concerning Streptococcus pneumoniae, three studies based on
large scale investigations on pneumococcal virulence
genes by signature-tagged mutagenesis (STM) are available. They respectively focus on (i) a serotype 19F strain
(strain G54) studied in pneumonia (108 CFU of a pool of
50 mutants given intranasally) and septicaemia models
(103, 104 and 105 CFU given intraperitoneally) in BALB/C
mice [13], (ii) a serotype 3 strain (strain 0100993) in
pneumonia (2 × 107 CFU of a pool of 94 mutants
delivered intranasally) and bacteraemia (105 CFU given
intraperitoneally) models in Swiss CD1 and CBA/J mice
[23] and (iii) a serotype 4 strain (TIGR4) in a pneumonia
model (2 × 107 CFU of a pool of 63 mutants delivered
intranasally) in Swiss Webster outbred mice [14]. While

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/3/14

Lau et al. [23] did not identify zinc metalloproteinases as
virulence determinants using a type 3 strain, both works
on a type 19F and on a type 4 strain, pointed out the
involvement of zinc metalloproteinases in pneumococcal
virulence and pathogenesis. Polissi et al. [13] described
strong virulence reduction in a sepsis model of a iga
mutant (19F type, the SP1154-homologue of G54 is
deposited as SPN03143). However the presence of tandem zinc metalloproteinase genes in this locus (see Figure
1 in ref [5]) does not allow to ascertain the specific contribution of Iga in virulence reduction. Concerning ZmpC,
mutation of this locus in the 19F background, is reported
to generate attenuation in a pneumonia mouse model
while no reduction of virulence is reported in the sepsis
model (the SPN1471 mutant is described by Polissi et al.
[13] as mutated in a protease having 40% amino acid
identity and 60% homology to pneumococcal IgA protease – values which match ZmpC). Hava and Camilli
[14] identified all three pneumococcal zinc metalloproteinases, using a type 4 strain, as important virulence factors
in pneumonia: however the mutants were not further
characterized through testing bacteraemia and nasal carriage [14]. Two of the three reports agree on the inability
to recover proteinase mutants in mice infected with 200 to
1000 times the LD50 of a wild type strain. This lack of
fitness, thus, does not clarify if the loss of virulence might
depend on other competing co-infecting clones
(increased generation time, lack of cleavage of housekeeping factors etc.) or on the interaction of bacterial strains
with host factors (decreased resistance to phagocytosis,
impaired adhesion or invasion, impaired cleavage of host
compounds etc.). Studies on single proteinase mutants are
up to now limited to the description of zmpC mutants in
a septicaemia model by Polissi and colleagues [13] and in
our intranasal model [5]. In the septicaemia model the
zmpC mutant does not show reduction of virulence [13],
which is in accordance with our observation describing an
unaltered level of bacteremia is when intranasally challenging mice with this mutant [5]. The reduced of the
number of mice developing sepsis (intranasal inoculum)
[5], has been proposed to indicate that the contribution to
pathogenesis and disease of ZmpC relates to an event
prior to invasion of the bloodstream. For the other proteinase preliminary data were reported by the groups of
Mitchell and Claverys [21], who found that deletion of
zmpB caused a significant reduction in bacteraemia levels
and increased survival time following both intranasal and
intravenous challenge.
The aim of the present work was to characterise in parallel
the impact of the mutations in single zinc metalloproteinase genes on pneumococcal virulence. Mutants in all
three zinc proteinase genes, iga, zmpB and zmpC, were generated and used to carry out in vivo virulence experiments,
after confirming that in vitro growth parameters of

mutant strains matched the ones of the wild type. Our
intranasal infection animal model [5] is comparable to
other models [13,14,32,33], which describe pneumonia
development and subsequent death due to sepsis in mice.
Our data show that the two proteinases present in all
pneumococcal strains (Iga and ZmpB) [5–8] (Figure 1)
greatly contribute to virulence in mice as demonstrated by
the 36-fold reduction of mice LD50 (Figure 3). ZmpC (Figure 1), present in only about 25% of strains [5], has a
lower impact on animal survival, considering there was
only a 4.7-fold reduction in mutant virulence with respect
to the parent strain (Figure 2 and 3). Our data are in
accordance with the STM data of Hava and Camilli [14],
who describe the importance of all zinc metalloproteinases on the virulence of serotype 4 TIGR4 strain. Our data
in part confirm results of Polissi et al. [13] who report
attenuation in virulence of iga and zmpC mutants. Differently, our data do not match the results obtained by Lau
et al [23], who do not describe the zinc metalloproteinases
genes as related to virulence. Comparing our data to these
studies it is difficult to understand whether these discrepancies depend on the use of different pneumococcal serotypes or on other factors (STM library used, mouse strain,
growth media, or size of inoculum).
The main conclusion arising from our work is that the use
of a variety of doses in infection studies is essential in
order to detect the impact of the different extra-cellular
zinc metalloproteinases on virulence. This is evidenced by
the fact that 100 LD50 were lethal for all animals within
few days despite the mutations. The attenuation of the
zmpC mutant observed only at one challenge dose (106
CFU) further underlines the importance of the infecting
bacterial dose in virulence factor analysis. Altogether our
data thus confirm STM data carried out on the same bacterial strain and add knowledge on the impact of the single mutations on pathogenesis after intranasal infection.

Conclusions
In order to clarify and compare the impact of three large
extracellular zinc metalloproteinases, denominated as Iga,
ZmpB and ZmpC, on virulence of S. pneumoniae, we conducted in vivo studies by intranasal infection in mice using
knock-out mutant bacteria, and observed disease symptoms and detected LD50s of each pneumococcal strain.
Our data show that in this specific disease model IgA and
ZmpB significantly contribute to the virulence of the
pneumococcus, while the impact of ZmpC is less profound. The present findings propose these proteins as
candidate surface enzymes contributing to pneumococcal
disease in the lung. Still, an important aspect, not covered
by the present work relates to the different and possible
multiple substrates of the enzymes. Although the role of
Iga was recently linked to adhesion (IgA mediated adhesion) [15], and the one of ZmpC to invasion (cleavage of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/3/14

MMP-9) [5] a single disease model may not be sufficient
in clarifying their in vivo function. Comparative studies of
bacterial dissemination to different organs (mucosa, lung,
blood, spleen, and CSF) following induction of different
pneumococcal diseases (pneumonia, meningitis and septicaemia) via different routes (intranasal, intravenous,
intracerebral), may be needed for the characterisation of
the specific role in virulence of the single zinc
metalloproteinases.

Methods
Construction of mutants and assessment of bacterial
growth
Chromosomal regions with deletions of the three zinc
metalloproteinases were amplified from unencapsulated
TIGR4 [6,34] derivatives in which the proteinase genes
were replaced with antibiotic resistance cassettes [5]. For
in vivo experiments, mutantagenic constructs were transferred into the encapsulated TIGR4 strain and denominated as FP122 (∆SP0071/zmpC), FP173 (∆SP0664/
zmpB) and FP174 (∆SP1154/iga) respectively (Table 1).
All PCR procedures were performed with the Expand High
Fidelity Kit (Roche) to reduce the risk of errors in the
extension process. The structure of the recombinant chromosomal locus was controlled in selected transformants
by PCR using primers located on the marker, the deleted
gene and surrounding conserved segments. In order to
evaluate the growth rate of the mutants in comparison to
the wild type, FP122, FP173, FP174 and TIGR4 bacterial
strains were grown in tryptic soy broth (TSB) without
selection and the growth curve was read in a Bonet-Maury
Biophotometre (Jobin Yvon, Division d'Instruments,
S.A.).
Transformation procedures
Transformation procedures were principally as described
previously [5,34–36]. In brief, cells grown to O.D. 590 nm
of 0.05 in CAT/GP were diluted 1/100 in CTM and grown
for 30 min. Serial aliquots (4 × 1.5 ml for each time point)
taken every 15 min are frozen at -80°C. One aliquot for
each time point is transformed using chromosomal DNA
carrying a point mutation conferring resistance to novobiocin to assay for the competence of the collected aliquots. The aliquot yielding the highest number of
transformants is used for further experiments. The competence for genetic transformation in TIGR4 cells used in
this work, to generate the k.o. mutants for the three zinc
metalloproteinase genes, was found to be 5.2 × 102 CFU/
ml (novobiocin resistant transformants).
Zinc metalloproteinase sequences and phylogenic analysis
Phylogenic analysis was carried out aligning protein
sequences, since DNA sequences differed too much to permit a comparative evaluation. Due to the mosaic structure
of the streptococcal zinc metalloproteinases only the 180

amino acids surrounding the protease active site were
used to generate the treefile. Analysis was done by using
standard parameters with the freely downloadable software ClustalX ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/software/dos/clustalx/, for alignments and calculation of the trees, and
TreeView 1.6.1. http://taxonomy.zoology.gla.ac.uk/rod/
treeview.html, for viewing the outputs. Published zinc
metalloproteinases were downloaded from GenBank [6–
8], while preliminary sequence data were obtained from
The Institute for Genomic Research through the website at
http://www.tigr.org and from The Wellcome Trust Sanger
Institute through the website at http://www.sanger.ac.uk/
(last accessed January 27th 2003).
Mice
Outbred 9-weeks-old female MF1 mice [37] weighing 21–
25 g were obtained from Harlan Nossan (Correzzana,
Italy). Animals were allowed to settle in the new environment for 1 week before performing the experiments, they
were caged into groups of 6 and given food and water ad
libitum. All animal experiments were conducted according
to institutional guidelines.
Experimental mouse model of pneumonia
Encapsulated TIGR4 strain and its isogenic derivatives
∆zmpC/SP0071 (FP122), ∆zmpB/SP0664 (FP173) and
∆iga/SP1154 (FP174) were passaged in female MF1 mice
as previously described [5,38]. Passaged bacteria were
grown in TSB at 37°C to an OD590 = 0.3, centrifuged for
20 minutes at 1500 g, resuspended in fresh TSB with 15%
glycerol and frozen in aliquots at -70°C. Before use, bacteria were thawed at room temperature, harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in sterile PBS. To allow
pulmonary infection, mice were fully anaesthetized by
intramuscular (i.m.) injection of 1 mg/kg Zoletil (Virbac)
and 0.12% Xylor (Xylazine). Doses ranging from 105 to
107 cfu were administered to the nostrils of mice (n = 6–
12) by giving a total volume of 20 µl of the bacterial inoculum with a Gilson pipette. Mice were regularly monitored for clinical symptoms (starry fur, hunched
appearance, lethargy); symptoms were recorded over 8
days (168 hours), at which point the experiment was
ended.
Statistical analysis
Differences in mice survival over time between wild type
and mutant strains were statistically analyzed using the
Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon Test, considering the last day of
clinical symptoms observation (8 days). A value of P <
0.01 was considered statistically significant. Differences in
mice survival percentage at each single dose between wild
type and mutant strains were analyzed with Fisher's Exact
Test by using GraphPad InStat. A value of P < 0.05 was
considered significant.
