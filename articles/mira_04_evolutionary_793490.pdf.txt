Abstract
Background: The phylogenetic position and evolutionary relationships of Fusobacteria remain
uncertain. Especially intriguing is their relatedness to low G+C Gram positive bacteria (Firmicutes)
by ribosomal molecular phylogenies, but their possession of a typical gram negative outer
membrane. Taking advantage of the recent completion of the Fusobacterium nucleatum genome
sequence we have examined the evolutionary relationships of Fusobacterium genes by phylogenetic
analysis and comparative genomics tools.
Results: The data indicate that Fusobacterium has a core genome of a very different nature to other
bacterial lineages, and branches out at the base of Firmicutes. However, depending on the method
used, 35–56% of Fusobacterium genes appear to have a xenologous origin from bacteroidetes,
proteobacteria, spirochaetes and the Firmicutes themselves. A high number of hypothetical ORFs
with unusual codon usage and short lengths were found and hypothesized to be remnants of
transferred genes that were discarded. Some proteins and operons are also hypothesized to be of
mixed ancestry. A large portion of the Gram-negative cell wall-related genes seems to have been
transferred from proteobacteria.
Conclusions: Many instances of similarity to other inhabitants of the dental plaque that have been
sequenced were found. This suggests that the close physical contact found in this environment
might facilitate horizontal gene transfer, supporting the idea of niche-specific gene pools. We
hypothesize that at a point in time, probably associated to the rise of mammals, a strong selective
pressure might have existed for a cell with a Clostridia-like metabolic apparatus but with the
adhesive and immune camouflage features of Proteobacteria.

Background
The genus Fusobacterium, together with some close relatives such as Leptotrichia, forms an ecologically and physiologically coherent group [1]. They seem to be inhabitants

of the mammal gastrointestinal tract probably specialized
in the oral cavity. Specifically, they are components of the
dental plaque, a highly complex habitat that has received
considerable attention in recent years due to its

involvement in dental pathology [2]. They are all fermentative anaerobes that use mostly peptides as their energy
source (see, for example, [3]). The species Fusobacterium
nucleatum has received particular attention being a key
component of the human dental plaque that also has considerable pathogenic potential. In fact after Bacteroides,
Fusobacterium is responsible for most human anaerobic
infections, producing abscesses at different locations and
aspiration pneumonia among other serious conditions
[4,5].
Phylogenetically speaking the fusobacteria have become
somewhat of a puzzle [6]. Originally classified with
Bacteroides and other Gram negative anaerobes, their association became conflicting when, after the extensive gene
sequencing carried out by the mid 80's, it became clear
that Bacteroides showed a clear relationship to other aerobic Gram negatives such as Flavobacterium or Cytophaga [79] while on the grounds of the 16S rRNA sequence Fusobacterium appeared as a separate cluster only distantly
associated to the low G+C Gram positives [10,11]. However, this association is methodology sensitive, and different algorithms or genes associate them with other groups
such as the Proteobacteria, the Cyanobacteria, the Thermotogales, or within the Firmicutes (see for example [1214]).
The publication of the Fusobacterium nucleatum genome
[3] did not solve the problem since although most BLAST
top-hits appeared as Clostridium species (low G+C Gram
positives) genomic analysis showed also a strong proximity to Proteobacteria. Based on the ERGO chromosomal
clustering tool, F. nucleatum had more "clusters" of genes
with the same gene order in common with Escherichia coli
than with Enterococcus or Staphylococcus, although less
than with Clostridium or Bacillus [3]. As expected, most elements typical of a Gram negative cell wall were found in
the genome including porins, outer membrane transport
systems, lipid A synthesis pathways and LPS core compounds. It may be argued that the Gram negative cell wall
is the ancestral situation and the Gram positives have lost
the outer membrane. However, this scenario requires a
remarkable stability in the components of the fusobacterial cell wall to remain so similar to other distant bacterial
phyla [15]. On the other hand, there is the possibility that
large portions of the fusobacterial genome could be the
result of horizontal gene transfer (HGT). The oral cavity
environment where F. nucleatum thrives is an ecosystem
with a large bacterial biodiversity. In a recent survey using
16S rDNA sequences from sub gingival plaque samples,
347 species or phylogroups were identified, and the best
estimate of the total species diversity in the oral cavity is
approximately 500 species [16]. These 347 species
belonged to 9 different bacterial taxa and F. nucleatum
interacts with a great deal of them, because it plays a cru-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/50

cial "bridge" role between early and late colonizers of the
tooth surface [17] and forms carbohydrate-mediated
coaggregations with other species [18-21]. Because of the
many species with which F. nucleatum interacts and aggregates (including spirochaetes, proteobacteria, bacteroidetes, firmicutes, and even fungi) there is a great
potential for HGT.
We have reanalysed the fully sequenced genome of F.
nucleatum, using a variety of bioinformatics tools, in an
attempt to clarify the phylogenetic position of the Fusobacteria and the relative contributions of vertical descent
and horizontal transfer in shaping the genome of this
highly specialized organism. In addition, our study aims
at providing material for further discussions on evolution
of the gram-negative cell wall, and on the evolution of
bacterial communities in micro-environments.

Results and Discussion
Phylogenetic position of core fusobacterial genes
It is generally assumed that in every genome there is, at
least, a basic core of genes that are inherited vertically and
may be used to infer relationships among prokaryotes
[22]. Although most often the relationships obtained with
the core genes are consistent with that of the 16S rRNA
gene we have extended this type of analysis to include as
many genes as possible. Firstly, a Bayesian tree using the
combined 16S-23S rRNA sequences was constructed (Figure 1). A neighbor-joining tree based on the concatenated
alignments from 44 ribosomal proteins gave a similar
result [see additional file 1]. In both cases, the fusobacteria appear as a clearly defined and distinct group that
branches out at the base of the Firmicutes but as an independent phylum. Finally, the 23 proteins conserved
across all sequenced Bacteria were selected [23] and trees
were constructed based on their sequences. Many of them
gave results consistent with the previous two trees [see
additional file 1]. However, some typical core genes
hinted of a mixed ancestry. The ribosome-associated protein prlA, for example, produced a tree that associated
Fusobacterium with the cyanobacteria and the elongation
factor tufA with the proteobacteria. Other cases are also
unclear. DNA pol III is a complex holoenzyme formed by
10 subunits in E. coli [24]. Interestingly, subunits α and β
of the polymerase III seem related to Firmicutes while the
gene for subunits γ and τ to Thermotoga and Aquifex. The
RNA-directed DNA polymerase and a RNA helicase seem
related to archaeal counterparts. In Clostridium, for example, to which most informational genes of Fusobacterium
have a best match, all subunits of both polymerases cluster clearly into the Firmicutes (data not shown). Summarizing, the fusobacteria appear as an independent taxon
with remote relatedness to the Firmicutes. Although the
phylogenetic signal for many genes was considerably
weak, the rRNA genes and the ribosomal proteins were

Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (the Gram-negative species to
which it shows the highest number of homologs). Due to
differences in mutational biases between the leading and
lagging strands, it is common to find the GC skew value
(G-C/G+C) with opposite signs on each replichore, the
change in sign indicating the origin or terminus of DNA
replication [25,26]. This skew is independent of GC content [27]. As the figure shows, both the Gram-positive and
Gram-negative bacteria which appear to have the most
similar gene content to F. nucleatum display a standard
plot, with mainly positive values over the right replichore
and negative values on the left replichore. Fusobacterium,
however, does not show a clear pattern, with constant
shifts in GC-skew values across the genome. This situation
could be caused by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) incorporating xenologous sequences with a different GC-skew
across the recipient chromosome, distorting a clear-cut
plot. In favour of this, many GC skew oscillations coincide with clusters of putative xenologous origin (see thin
arrows in Figure 2, top). It is interesting to note that an
oscillating GC skew plot is also observed in other
genomes that appear to have undergone massive HGT episodes (see, for example [28]).

replication origin (bottom) and terminus (top). Orange thin
arrows indicate the 36 "clusters" of four or more contiguous
genes that are potentially transferred from species outside
the Firmicutes. Note that some of F. nucleatum shifts in GC
skew coincide with putative HGT regions.

very congruent and therefore their trees (Figure 1 and
additional file 1) are likely to represent a reliable phylogenetic reconstruction of the core genome. Heretofore we
will refer to this affiliation as ribosomal phylogeny and
consider it as the reference for vertically inherited genes.
We have assumed that genes showing a close relationship
to other bacterial taxa (including the Firmicutes) are possible candidates for HGT origin, particularly when a close
association has been proved by more than one approach.
GC-skew plots
Figure 2 shows the GC-skew plot for F. nucleatum compared to Clostridium tetani (the sequenced species to which
it shows the highest number of homologous genes) and

The observed GC-skew could also arise from chromosomal inversions (see, for example, the genome of Yersinia
pestis -[29]). However, F. nucleatum should have undergone massive events of genomic scrambling to account for
the effect, including numerous non-symmetric inversions
around the replication origin and terminus, which are
rarely observed [30,31] and are assumed to be detrimental
[32]. Moreover, homologous genes present in the long
DNA fragments sequenced in the close relative F. nucleatum subsp vincentii [33] show an almost perfect sinteny: In
all 6 sequenced segments larger than 30 kb in vincentii,
gene order was conserved without a single chromosomal
inversion (data not shown). Although other related
genomes are not available for comparison and the potential inversions could have happened prior to the split of
both subspecies, the suggestion is that the oscillating GCskew plot is not due to multiple inversions. Finally, the
GC-skew plot of F. nucleatum could be partly due to multiple replication origins constantly shifting the values, but
this situation has not been observed in any bacterial
species.
Genome sequence similarity analysis
A sequence similarity search performed by BLASTP [34]
against the whole available database reveals homology to
over 150 bacterial and archaeal species. More than a quarter of the genes had no significant hit or a hit to a eukaryotic species. 64.6% of the hits went to Firmicutes species
and 35.4% to other bacterial species (Table 1). These
results seem congruent with the ribosomal phylogeny.
However, from the hits to Firmicutes, 267 ORFs

(representing 12.9% of the total genome) had a hit in
only one genus within this bacterial group together with
hits in another taxa, a feature suggestive of HGT to or from
these bacteria, that are very numerous and diverse in the
dental plaque [16].
When the top hits to the different groups are plotted, the
matches outside the Firmicutes are scattered along the
Fusobacterium chromosome and, in many cases, they are
clustered (Figure 3). There are 36 cases of clusters of 4 or
more contiguous genes that have a best hit outside the Firmicutes, many of which still preserve some gene order
compared to their phylogenetically unrelated counterparts. Five of these cases are shown in more detail in Figure 4. Gene arrangement conservation with distantly
related groups is a strong indication of HGT events.
It is interesting to note that there are 40 transposase ORFs
in the F. nucleatum genome and 73 assignments of possi-

ble IS elements [3]. Thirty-four of the transposase
sequences are at the flanks of putative transferred genes,
whereas 6 were between core genes (Figure 3). There are
also two integrase genes, both at the edge of putative
HGTs. In addition, Kapatral and collaborators [3]
described that active and remnant IS-elements are flanking many genes with high similarity to proteobacteria.
Among these there are outer membrane proteins, hemolysin precursors and activators, pyrophosphate synthesis
genes and others. Another possibility for the insertion of
xenologous sequences would be through the action of
bacteriophages. In F. nucleatum, 31 genes were found to
have homologs in phage regions of other bacteria (Figure
3) and 13 on plasmids. Small cryptic plasmids containing
mobile elements are frequently found in F. nucleatum
strains [35]. In addition, six phage contigs encoding 110
ORFs have been identified in its sister subspecies vincentii.
In this bacterium, the phage genes have homology to
Gram positive and Gram negative phages, with an average

since those organisms posses also Gram negative cell
walls, the similarity was always to the same groups and
much higher than what would be expected based on a
distant common origin of the corresponding Gram negative feature. The conservation of gene order and relatively
high similarity to groups present in the dental plaque (see
below) also hints at a secondary acquisition by HGT.
Therefore, the interpretation of F. nucleatum as a grampositive bacterium with gram-negative clothing [6]
appears quite realistic, with the xenologous sequences
being especially relevant in membrane-associated functions associated to a gram-negative cell wall.

GC content of 28% and a similar codon usage to the chromosome [33]. Thus, it is possible that an old phage infection is partly responsible for the mosaic genome of F.
nucleatum. For example, a region with 6 ORFs presents
homology to the proteobacterial bacteriophage P2, a
phage that has been shown to be responsible for HGT episodes in some E. coli strains [36].
Looking into more detail at the gene clusters with a best
hit outside Firmicutes it was found that many genes were
involved in typical gram-negative features, mainly membrane-associated functions (Table 2). For example, the
segment of genes FN1893-FN1897 includes 3 homologs
found in Salmonella typhimurium, coding for surfaceexposed virulence proteins and a membrane-associated
gene involved in D-ribose transport. Twenty-eight of the
36 clusters of 4 or more contiguous genes had a function
related to the outer membrane, the periplasm or pathogenecity typical of proteobacteria, CFB group species or
spirochaetes. Although this would have to be expected

Phylogenetic, gene-order and compositional analyses
BLAST analysis has the advantage of giving a closest similarity match for almost every gene. It is however a crude
method that can give as the top sequence similarity hit a
species that is not the closest from a phylogenetic point of
view [37] and it could also be much influenced by the
undersampling of certain poorly-sequenced groups, such
as the Fusobacteria. For example, when the BLAST top 10
best matches are considered, less than 70% of the hits fall
on the same bacterial taxa as the top hit. In top hits to
archaea, a domain from which fewer sequences are available, 58% of the top ten best matches hit groups other
than Archaea. Since we used the top hit to designate
potential phylogenetic origin, some degree of inaccuracy
is expected. Thus, to complement the BLAST analysis we
used a phylogenetic and a gene-order analysis, indicating
in Figure 3 whether their results do or do not support the
BLAST results. In the phylogenetic analysis, trees were
constructed based on the sequence of each individual
gene with sufficient homologs in the database (see
experimental procedures section for details). Over 1200
trees were generated and analysed to detect a phylogeny
either congruent with the ribosomal one, or suggestive of
HGT. Almost two thirds of the trees could be resolved, and
corroborated the high degree of gene transfer, with at least
25% of the genome being of xenologous origin (Table 3).
Only 8.4% were consistent with the ribosomal phylogeny,
and over 25% indicated a potential HGT to or from Firmicutes species. Part of the latter could also be due to multiple losses of the genes in most Firmicutes genera.
However, it is not unreasonable to think that they could
have been transferred between Fusobacteria and typical
Firmicutes (particularly clostridiales and streptococci),
which share the mouth and dental plaque ecosystem [16].
The phylogenetic analysis method, therefore, suggests a
25–50% of gene transfer. Although only trees with a
bootstrap value over 500 were considered (see methods
section), these numbers must be taken with caution.
Given the distant relationship of F. nucleatum with most
sequenced genomes, a weak phylogenetic signal may
remain for many trees. The branching pattern in trees is
also influenced by other variables like different rates of

evolution for different genes, method of alignment or
number of species included. Like in the sequence similarity method, the data presented are inferences based upon
the data, and the limitations of each method should be
kept in mind.
Another method used was based on the conservation of
gene order among certain gene clusters, a character that

can be used in phylogenetic reconstructions [38,39]. Only
738 F. nucleatum protein-coding genes belonged to clusters of 2 or more genes that had some order conservation
in other bacteria. From these, 35% had the same order as
most Firmicutes (Table 3), suggesting vertical inheritance.
Over 15% of the genes belonged to clusters whose gene
order was more consistent with HGT from this group (i.e.
same order as only one of the Firmicutes genomes). The

Page 9 of 17
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2004, 4:50

extent of HGT from Firmicutes could be overestimated if
the genes are ancestral but subsequently lost in most
Gram-positive lineages. This being the case, the addition
of vertically-inherited genes and genes inside Firmicutes
in Table 3 would indicate an upper limit of genes consistent with the ribosomal phylogeny. Even if HGT from Firmicutes is not considered, 42% of the genes were assigned
as HGT from other bacterial taxa based on the gene-order
method. These dramatic figures suggest again that the
genome of F. nucleatum could be an amalgamation of
genes from different groups, particularly those of species
that inhabit mammalian hosts in general and the mouth
niche in particular. A summary figure showing the outcome of the three methods is published as supplementary
material [see additional file 1]. The discrepancies between
the three methods can be partly influenced by the different sample sizes used (Table 3). In addition, it must be
noted that most of the discrepancy appears in the Phylogenetic Trees method, where a very low percentage of vertical inheritance was detected. In this analysis, over 38%
of the trees were unresolved, introducing an important
degree of variation. It is therefore possible that many of
the genes giving uncertain phylogenies are consistent with
vertical inheritance, but the phylogenetic signal is too
weak to give a clear-cut tree. The gene-order method could
give higher numbers of horizontal transfers if operons are
more likely to be transferred than single genes [40]. Thus,
all three methods have its limitations, and although the
importance of HGT is clear, the numbers obtained may be
subject to certain bias imposed by the methodology [41].
Deviations from genomic GC content and codon usage
have been used to infer potential gene transfers across bacteria [42,43]. However, only 40 genes with significantly
extraneous DNA composition were found in F. nucleatum
[44] suggesting that many transfers could come from lowGC species or that many of the transfers occurred long
ago, allowing the xenologous genes to ameliorate and
homogenize its characteristics with those of the recipient
genome [45]. In addition, the extremely low GC content
of F. nucleatum could make this method less discriminatory [46,47]. A few potential transfers were identified this
way, including a cluster spanning two iron-sulphur
binding proteins and two arsenic pump-driving ATPases.
Another interesting case was a glutamate fermentation
cluster with closest similarity and gene order conservation
to the clostridial species Acidaminococcus fermentans. This
represents a typical case of potential HGT from the Firmicutes that could be masked in a BLAST analysis as a vertically inherited cluster. As the tree and gene-order methods
show, the amount of HGT from/to the Firmicutes species
could be as high as 15–25%, assuming that the
percentages are maintained among the genes that we
could not analyse because the trees were unresolved or
because they were not part of conserved-order clusters.

Chimeric enzymes and operons
To explore the possibility that the chimeric nature of Fusobacterium may apply not only to its genome but also to
some of its metabolic pathways and enzymes, some specific cases were looked at in more detail. A potential example includes the RNA polymerase, where the β' subunit
has a best BLAST hit to spirochaetes as well as the RNA
polymerase sigma-E factor. This is confirmed by comparative analysis of domain architecture across bacteria [48].
An interesting instance is given by the phenylalanyl-tRNA
synthetase, in which the α and β chains have a Clostridium
and Geobacter (delta-proteobacteria) best sequence
similarity match, respectively. The tree analysis confirms
that the β chain is likely to have a proteobacterial origin.
Interestingly, although the β chain is located in a proteobacterial cluster (at the edge of cluster 12), it is contiguous
to the Firmicutes related α chain gene, separated by a very
short spacer without a promoter. This exemplifies how
selection may have put together two functionally related
genes, presumably to ease cotranscription, even though
their phylogenetic origin appears to be different.

Another example is given by an iron ABC transporter
operon formed by a periplasmic binding protein followed
by two iron permeases. A similar structure is repeated two
other times in the subsequent genes (Figure 5a), forming
a long iron transport system. Remarkably, the first operon
is found in identical gene order in the archaeon Methanosarcina acetivorans, to which it presents the highest
sequence similarity, whereas the second and third operon
appear to be a blend of genes with relatedness to firmicutes, proteobacteria, spirochaetes and Thermotoga. These
genes are present in many Gram negatives including Helicobacter and other Proteobacteria [49,50]. Thus, assuming
that some of these genes have a xenologous origin, they
must have been selected to occupy a precise gene order to
maximise its function within the iron transport system.
Another fascinating case of a potential chimeric gene system is that of transport of dipeptides (Figure 5b). There
are as many as five dipeptide transport operons in F. nucleatum, this time dispersed along the genome. Although one
of the sets has best matches to Firmicutes species, another
one appears to be of spirochaete source (also present in
the same gene order in Methanosarcina), whereas the other
three are, according to sequence similarity, gene order and
tree reconstruction a mixture of genes with archaeal, Firmicutes and proteobacterial origin. A third case can be
seen in the three copies of a hemin transport system
located away from each other and formed by a hemin
receptor and the genes hmuT, hmuU and hmuV. Although
the different taxonomical origin analysis methods are not
always consistent, two of the hemin operons are probably
of proteobacterial origin (Figure 5c). The other one has a
closest gene order to the spirochaete Treponema denticola,
also an inhabitant of the dental plaque, but is absent in its

close relative T. pallidum, suggesting again that gene transfer is facilitated across the bacteria that occupy this specialised niche.
Remnants of HGT
An indication of massive gene transfer events comes from
looking at intergenic spacer regions of F. nucleatum.
Although average spacer length in this species is 115 bp,

there are many long spacers of 500 bp and higher scattered across the genome. It was found that 21 of these
long spacers were located at positions flanked by a "core"
gene (that with a low-GC Gram-positive best match) and
a potential transferred gene, whereas only 8 appeared
between core genes. Since intergenic spacer regions are
known to increase in length as a result of genomic rearrangements and pseudogene formation [51], many of

these long spacers might be signatures of ancient HGT
events. In agreement with this view, another 17 long spacers were located inside gene clusters of a putative Gram
negative or archaeal origin. We hypothesize that these
long non-coding regions are remnants of transferred
genes that were not selected for and have been mostly
erased. When DNA sequence similarity searches are done
with these long spacers located inside xenologous clusters,
some significant matches are found to other regions of the
genome. For example, the long spacers inside clusters 4, 8
and 11 all have some sequence similarity (more than 85%
sequence identity over 125 bp or more using BLAST analysis, E-value <10-5) to one another and to other five long
spacers scattered throughout the genome. In all cases
except one, these long spacers are flanked by outer membrane proteins of Gram-negative origin, suggesting that
they may represent remnants of old membrane-associated
genes. A similar case is that of the long spacer located after
the hemolysin activator protein precursor (FN1818),
which shows high sequence similarity to a hemolysin activator located someplace else in the genome (and to
another spacer and a short ORF with unknown function).
Another potential signature of ancient transfers subsequently erased is the high number of ORFs without a
match in the complete, non-redundant NCBI database
(including its closely related subspecies vincentii), spanning 450 sequences that represent 20% of the genome.
On average, these orphan genes are extremely short (440
bp, versus 1040 bp for the rest of genes with a match on
the DNA database, see Figure 6), suggesting that they do
not represent real genes [52,31]. Overannotation of short
ORFs that are not functional is more common on GC-rich

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/50

genomes due to a lower probability of stop codons [53],
but F. nucleatum is just 27% G+C. It is therefore possible
that many of these short ORFs are eroded pseudogenes or
remnants of fragmented genes, as it has been demonstrated in Rickettsia [54], where many genes appear to be
under low selection coefficients in its intracellular environment. In Fusobacterium, it is likely that many transferred genes were not useful and got eliminated, a process
known to happen very rapidly [55]. This would explain
the high number of short ORFs without significant BLAST
matches on the database, as small fragments of genes may
have accumulated enough mutations to make them frequently unrecognisable by sequence similarity. For many
of these small ORFs with no significant matches, some
low sequence similarity is found to gram-negative outer
membrane proteins (e.g. tolA), glycine permease, periplasmic-like proteins, etc.
In addition, some short ORFs appear to be degraded fragments of bigger genes. For example, there are 3 sequences
with similarity to HIPA proteins, one of which is less than
half the length of the other two. As it also has a very biased
codon usage, it is likely that it represents a degraded remnant of this protein. The 3 copies of integrases scattered
across the genome show another case. Two of them are
around 900 bp long and have a normal codon usage. The
third copy (FN0402) is only 177 bp long, is flanked by a
long spacer and has a very skewed codon usage. In
general, the codon usage of these orphans is very biased
(mean corrected χ2 values of 0.47 versus 0.22 for the rest
of the genome). As it is unlikely that all these short ORFs
are highly expressed, we believe that this biased codon utilization is reflecting very divergent pseudogene fragments.
Thus, the picture that emerges is that of massive gene
transfer leaving many non-coding segments that are remnants of unnecessary genes and genomic rearrangements.

Conclusions
The genome of F. nucleatum possesses a remarkable
amount of patchiness with any kind of phylogenetic analyses used. This can be said to a certain degree of some
other genomes (see for example [56]). One possible
explanation for this kind of results is an undersampling of
the group considered what gives only very distant and
hence uncertain similarities to a variety of prokaryotic
groups. This might be the case for part of the Fusobacterium
genome that gives very weak and uncertain phylogenetic
signal. However, the observation that certain genes and
operons are shared by distantly related species that
inhabit the dental plaque (for example, the spirochaete T.
denticola, the proteobacteria Campylobacter and the CFB P.
gingivalis) points to HGT as the most likely origin of these
genes. Even less apparent, our work suggests multiple episodes of gene transfer to or from phylogenetically-related
bacteria, like certain Firmicutes species (such as the

Page 12 of 17

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2004, 4:50

cariogenic bacterium S. mutans or some Clostridia), that
might be confounded with vertically inherited traits.
The origin of the Gram-negative cell wall found in Fusobacterium requires special consideration. Some type of
Gram-negative cell wall seems to be the default phenotype
in Bacteria (see, for example [57]), being found in most
deeply branching groups. Moreover, even some deep
branches of the Firmicutes contain organisms (such as
Sporomusa and Desulfotomaculum) with Gram-negative cell
wall structures [58,59]. On the other hand, it has also
been proposed that the Gram-positive cell wall is the
default structure [60]. It might be argued that
Fusobacterium is a remnant of the ancestral cells predating the bacterial radiation that originated either Grampositive or Gram-negative cell walls. This is supported by
phylogenetic inferences based on conserved indels, which
place Fusobacteria at an intermediate position between
Gram-positive and Gram-negative taxa [61]. However, in
light of our results this explanation does not seem likely.
Fusobacterium does not show any primitive trait and its
outer membrane and transport mechanisms show all the
characteristics of any sophisticated Gram-negative cell
wall. In addition, many of the outer membrane proteins
are closest to specific taxa (mainly to proteobacterial species) and not equally dispersed among species with a
Gram-negative cell wall. Thus, many of the genes involved
in the construction of the Gram-negative outer membrane
have probably been horizontally transferred. The extent of
this transfer deserves further examination. If we assume
that Fusobacterium evolved after the Gram-positive/negative divergence on the low-GC Gram-positive lineage,
massive HGT is the most likely explanation for the formation of the outer membrane. On the other end of possible
explanations, most genes of the outer membrane would
already be present in the common ancestor of
fusobacteria and Firmicutes, where a massive loss would
be responsible for the differences observed today.
Recently, the idea of gene pools that are characteristic of
certain environments has been advanced to explain the
large number of common genes among groups of thermoacidophiles distantly related by ribosomal phylogeny
[62]. The presence of a common pool of dental plaque
genes is not unlikely in light of the results described here.
However, the time scale of the adaptation to the latter
habitat is much shorter that that of thermoacidophiles
and can be probably estimated around the origin of mammals (about 120 million years). Even going backwards to
the origin of the vertebrate's intestine it would put the
selective pressure for these gene combinations to originate
no earlier than 400 Myr ago. Former chimeric genomes
have been explained as selected by strong environmental
pressure. The case of Thermotoga is paradigmatic, a hyperthermophilic bacteria that is assumed to have recruited

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/50

genes from the archaeal hyperthermophiles to reach its
unusual (for bacteria) thermotolerance. Here (as in the
case of Methanosarcina, a mesophilic anaerobe) there is
not such an obvious explanation. F. nucleatum natural
habitat seems to be the dental plaque of mammals, a
rather unique and special environment that probably
requires very special features to survive. Strong adhesion
mechanisms, such as those found often in the Proteobacteria, probably represent an essential ability for survival in
the early stages of plaque formation, particularly for nonmotile cells. Also the mucose-associated immune system
that prevails in the mouth of mammals could have acted
as a strong selective pressure favoring the Gram-negative
envelopes that are often less immunogenic and easier to
disguise thanks to the LPS polysaccharide O chain [63].
Thus, it is not difficult to envisage that at a point in time,
probably associated to the rise of mammals, a strong
selective pressure might have existed for a cell with the
metabolic apparatus of Clostridia for amino acid fermentation but with the adhesive and immune camouflage paraphernalia of the Proteobacteria. It is remarkable to note
that many of the genes that determine the lifestyle of Fusobacterium and its interaction with the environment, such
as peptide transport systems, cell adhesins and outer
membrane components have probably been acquired by
gene transfer. It is therefore not only the number of horizontal transfers but also their contribution to niche adaptation that makes the HGT mechanism of dramatic impact
on genomes. It is interesting that some of these genes are
shared by different organisms inhabiting the dental
plaque. From an applied point of view, some of these
highly transferred genes are likely to provide a critical
advantage in the establishment and adaptation of the bacteria to their niche, and could be used as potential targets
for antimicrobial agents.

Methods
Phylogenetic trees
rRNA and evolutionary conserved proteins trees
The different rRNA and conserved protein data sets were
analyzed with Bayesian methods using the program
MrBAYES 3 [64]. For the fusion of 16S+23S rRNA
sequences, the GTR model with a Γ law (8 rate categories)
and a proportion of invariant sites to take among-site rate
variation into account was used. A similar procedure was
used to construct the trees based on evolutionary conserved proteins (a mixed substitution model and a Γ law
with 8 rate categories and a proportion of invariant sites
were applied). The evolutionary conserved proteins were
defined as those found in all sequenced species of Bacteria
and assumed to form part of the minimal genome necessary for life [65,66]. The list was extracted from [23] but
removing the genes for which paralogous ORFs were
found. In all cases, the Markov chain Monte Carlo
searches were run with 4 chains for 1,000,000

generations, with trees being sampled every 100 generations (the first 2,500 trees were discarded as "burnin").
Concatenated ribosomal proteins tree
The amino-acid sequences of ribosomal genes S1–S20
and L1–L35, excluding S1, S14, L24, L25, L30, L31, L32
and L33, were retrieved from the KEGG website from a
total of 60 different bacteria. The bacteria chosen were all
those represented in the KEGG ribosomal genes ortholog
table [67], except Rickettsia prowazekii, Rickettsia conorii,
Wigglesworthia brevipalpis, and Buchnera aphidicola, and
with the addition of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and and
Desulfovibrio vulgaris. An alignment was generated for each
ribosomal gene, using the Clustalw software with default
parameters [68]. When two or more paralogs were found
in a species, the most divergent of the paralogs was
removed from the alignment. A concatenated alignment
including the species for which all of the selected ribosomal genes were present was generated. A neighbor-joining tree with 1000 bootstrap replicates was produced from
the alignment using Clustalw [68], excluding positions
with gaps, and correcting for multiple amino-acid substitutions (Kimura correction). The tree was visualized with
NJPLOT [69]. Exclusion of ribosomal proteins was based
on the following: S14 has been shown to be subject to
horizontal transfer [70], L24 is truncated and split in Fusobacterium nucleatum, S1 is absent/truncated in the Mollicutes subgroup of the low-GC gram-positives, L25, L30,
L31, L32, L33 contained a high number of paralogs and/
or were absent in several key species.
Methods for detecting HGT
Blast method
The protein sequences of Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp.
nucleatum ATCC 25586 were retrieved from ftp://
ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Bacteria. Peptide sequence
database of all non-redundant GenBank CDS translations
+ PDB + SwissProt + PIR was retrieved from ftp://
ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/db. We performed an all against all
BLASTP [34] search of each protein in Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum ATCC 255586 against peptide
sequence database. We then recorded the top hit for each
protein sequence with an E-value of 10-5, filtering the hits
whose sequence identity and length was lower than 30
and 50%, respectively. We categorized all the hits into 8
categories as belonging to the CFB group, Firmicutes bacteria,
α,β,γ-Proteobacteria,
δ,ε-Proteobacteria,
Spirochaetes, other Bacteria, Archaea and Eukaryotes/no
hit. Hits to Firmicutes (the group to which Fusobacterium
appear to be more closely-related) were refined by further
BlastP analysis between F. nucleatum and the 31
sequenced bacteria available from this group. If the gene
had a homolog in only one genus from all the available
low-GC gram-positive species, it was considered a HGT
event from/to this group. If it was present in more than

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/50

one genus it was considered vertically inherited and consistent with the ribosomal phylogeny. There were 61 cases
of genes found in more than one genera from a single
subgroup of this taxon (i.e. present only in the Clostridiales, the Bacillales, the Mollicutes or the Lactobacillales).
These can be equally explained by HGT or by common
descent and were conservatively assigned to the vertical
inherited category.
Phylogenetic trees method
For each F. nucleatum gene, the protein sequences of up to
50 best blast hits with e-value lower than e-5 were retrieved
(the hits were identified by the "Blast method" described
above). All sequences were then automatically clustered
with the Clustalw alignment tool with default parameters.
A neighbor-joining tree with 1000 bootstrap replicates
was generated from the resulting alignment, using Clustalw with default parameters. The trees were visualized
with NJPLOT [69]. In all cases, the bootstrap values at the
nodes chosen for a decision on taxonomical assignment
had to be over 500. Assignment of the F. nucleatum genes
to a taxonomic group was done using the following
criteria:
Low-GC gram-positives
A F. nucleatum gene was determined to originate from the
firmicutes if it was found in the tree most closely associated with at least 5 different species from that group, or
with at least 3 species from 2 different subgroups (where
the subgroups were: mollicutes, bacillales, lactobacillales,
clostridiales). If the F. nucleatum gene branched at the base
of the firmicutes, the gene was assigned as being consistent with phylogeny; otherwise, it was assigned as a potential horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from the firmicutes.
Proteobacteria
Same as described above (low-GC gram-positives), the
subgroups in this case were:alpha-, beta-, gamma-,
gamma-entero-, delta-, and epsilon-proteobacteria. In the
case of the proteobacteria, all F. nucleatum genes with trees
fulfilling this criteria were assigned as HGTs from proteobacteria. Note that a distinction was made between the
grouping of the alpha-, beta-, and gamma- proteobacteria,
and the grouping of the epsilon- and delta- proteobacteria
whenever possible.
Archaea
To be assigned as originating from the archaeales, the F.
nucleatum had to be closest to at least 3 species, and there
had to be a clear association between the two groups, i.e.
the branches were relatively short, and the tree topology
did not resemble a "star phylogeny".

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2004, 4:50

High-GC gram-positives, Cyanobacteria, Chlamydiales
To be assigned to these groups, the F. nucleatum gene had
to be found closest in the tree to at least 3 different species,
there had to be a clear association (see above in "Archaeales") and there should have been no obvious evidence of
gene transfer from the Fusobacteria. Evidence of transfer
from the Fusobacteria would be when, apart from the
association to some species of the high-GC gram positives
(or Cyanobacteriales, or Chlamydiales), the tree placed
the F. nucleatum gene in agreement with the accepted species phylogeny (just outside of the firmicutes).
Aquifales, Deinococcales
The F. nucleatum gene had to be found closest to at least 1
species from that group (Aquifales, or Deinococcales). A
clear association was necessary, as well as no evidence of
transfer from Fusobacteria (see above).
Spirochaetes, CFB group
The F. nucleatum gene had to be closest to at least 2 species
from that group, or 1 species with a clear association, and
no evidence of transfer from Fusobacteria.
Unknown
If the tree contained less than four hits other than eukaryotes and other Fusobacteria, the gene was not considered
for further analysis. In cases where it was not possible to
clearly associate a taxonomic group to the F. nucleatum
gene, it was then assigned as "unknown/not resolved".
Gene-order method
In order to identify clusters of at least two genes with conserved order between F. nucleatum and other genomes, all
available amino-acid protein sequences sets for all replicons of all published bacterial and archaeal genomes at
the time (may 1st 2004) were downloaded from the NCBI
ftp website ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/. All Orthologs of F.
nucleatum genes (reciprocal best blast hit) were detected
between the two replicons (F. nucleatum and replicon X).
Clusters of consecutive orthologs were found (consecutive
orthologs are determined in terms of the numbered position in both F. nucleatum (exactly consecutive) and replicon X (possible gap of 2 genes in between the orthologs),
and for each cluster, a score was assigned as follows:

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/50

1."Deletions" is the number of "gene gaps" found in replicon X for that cluster, whatever their size, "Mean(Identity%)" is the mean of the %identity of all blast results for
the orthologs of the cluster. Mean(Length%) is the mean
of the length of all blast results for the orthologs of the
cluster, where length is defined as the minimum of length
of (blast hit/ length of query sequence) and (length of
blast hit/length of subject sequence). Each ortholog in the
cluster was assigned the same score, and following completion of the procedure for all replicons in the database,
for each F. nucleatum gene the orthologs that were part of
clusters were ordered by their score, and an excel table was
generated for manual investigation. If the gene order of a
given gene cluster was not preserved in Firmicutes species
but maintained in another procaryotic group, the genes
were assigned as HGT from/to the group with the highest
score (highest gene-order conservation). If the order was
preserved in at least one species from two or more groups
of low-GC gram-positives (Clostridiales, Bacillales, Lactobacillales and Mollicutes) the cluster was assumed to be
ancestral to the divergence of fusobacteria and Firmicutes,
and consistent with the ribosomal phylogeny. If gene
order was preserved in one or more species from only one
of the low-GC gram-positive groups the cluster was classified as HGT from low-GC gram-positive bacteria.
GC-skew plots and gene classification
Classical GC-skew plots were done using the formula (GC)/(G+C) in 5000 bp windows, following Lobry's methods [25,26]. The functional classification of F. nucleatum
genes by function was based on the TIGR Gene Attribute
Annotation [73].
