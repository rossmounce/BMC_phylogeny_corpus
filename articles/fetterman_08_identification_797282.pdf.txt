Abstract
Background: Members of the forkhead gene family act as transcription regulators in biological
processes including development and metabolism. The evolution of forkhead genes has not been
widely examined and selection pressures at the molecular level influencing subfamily evolution and
differentiation have not been explored. Here, in silico
pressures acting on the coding sequence of five multi-species FOX protein subfamily clusters;
FoxA, FoxD, FoxI, FoxO and FoxP.
Results: Application of site models, which estimate overall selection pressures on individual
codons throughout the phylogeny, showed that the amino acid changes observed were either
neutral or under negative selection. Branch-site models, which allow estimated selection pressures
along specified lineages to vary as compared to the remaining phylogeny, identified positive
selection along branches leading to the FoxA3 and Protostomia clades in the FoxA cluster and the
branch leading to the FoxO3 clade in the FoxO cluster. Residues that may differentiate paralogs
were identified in the FoxA and FoxO clusters and residues that differentiate orthologs were
identified in the FoxA cluster. Neutral amino acid changes were identified in the forkhead domain
of the FoxA, FoxD and FoxP clusters while positive selection was identified in the forkhead domain
of the Protostomia lineage of the FoxA cluster. A series of residues under strong negative selection
adjacent to the N- and C-termini of the forkhead domain were identified in all clusters analyzed
suggesting a new method for refinement of domain boundaries. Extrapolation of domains among
cluster members in conjunction with selection pressure information allowed prediction of residue
function in the FoxA, FoxO and FoxP clusters and exclusion of known domain function in residues
of the FoxA and FoxI clusters.
Conclusion: Consideration of selection pressures observed in conjunction with known functional
information allowed prediction of residue function and refinement of domain boundaries.
Identification of residues that differentiate orthologs and paralogs provided insight into the
development and functional consequences of paralogs and forkhead subfamily composition
differences among species. Overall we found that after gene duplication of forkhead family
members, rapid differentiation and subsequent fixation of amino acid changes through negative
selection has occurred.

Background
A highly conserved DNA binding domain, termed 'forkhead' due to the physical appearance of Drosophila fork
head mutants, defines forkhead gene family members.
Forkhead family members act as transcription activators
or repressors in biological processes involved in development and metabolism. Human diseases such as AxenfeldRieger syndrome [1], lymphedema-distichiasis [2], developmental verbal dyspraxia [3], and various cancers [4-7]
have been associated with mutations or chromosomal
rearrangements of forkhead genes. Forkhead genes have
been identified in a wide variety of animals and fungi but
not plants. Within the forkhead gene family, subfamilies
were delineated by their position within a phylogenetic
tree that was created using only the forkhead domain
sequences [8]. Different subfamilies are identified by letters, with subfamilies A through S noted in humans. For
many species, multiple members of a subfamily are
known to exist and are further delineated by Arabic
numerals.
While some research has examined forkhead gene family
evolution, selection pressures on individual codons have
not been measured and studies that have examined evolutionary forces acting on entire forkhead genes have
included only orthologous sequences from a subfamily.
Here we analyze entire subfamilies to explore the evolutionary and functional significance of subfamily paralogs
and orthologs. Gene duplication, and subsequent selection driving adaptive evolution, is thought to create gene
families with differentiated family members. At the
molecular level, amino acid changes that result in reduced
fitness are removed by negative selection whereas changes
that increase fitness are maintained by positive selection.
When amino acid changes do not decrease or increase fitness, the changes are considered neutral. At individual
codons, also known as sites, natural selection can be
measured in terms of ω, the nonsynonymous substitution
rate divided by the synonymous substitution rate. An ω <
1 indicates negative selection is occurring while ω > 1 suggests positive selection and ω = 1 for neutral changes. Negative or positive selection of amino acid residues implies
that the residues are functionally important. Neutral
changes at amino acid sites imply that the exact composition of amino acids at these sites is unimportant and that
they are not directly involved in protein function.
We sought to identify the selection pressures acting on
individual amino acid sites in forkhead gene family members. Five forkhead subfamilies, FoxA, FoxD, FoxI, FoxO
and FoxP were examined independently using branch-site
and site models implemented in the codeml program,
contained in the PAML package. The results of our analysis of site and lineage specific selection patterns, in conjunction with prior information concerning the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/261

functional importance of amino acid residues in each
cluster, provide insights into forkhead gene family evolution and information regarding potential functional and
nonfunctional amino acids in this important transcription factor gene family.

Methods
Sequence Data
A list of 672 amino acid sequences containing the forkhead domain was retrieved from the NCBI Entrez Protein
Database using the Conserved Domain Architecture
Retrieval Tool (CDART) [9] in conjunction with the Conserved Domain Database forkhead domain definition,
cd00059 [10,11]. Sequences described as partial, incomplete, fragment, predicted, putative and hypothetical as
well as duplicates and isoforms were excluded resulting in
a total of 299 sequences from 51 species analyzed. Initial
analysis of all known forkhead genes simultaneously
using global or local alignment methods, and parsimony,
likelihood or Bayesian phylogenetic methods, produced
trees with inconsistent subfamily placement due to low
sequence homology outside of the forkhead domain
among different subfamilies. BLASTCLUST was therefore
used to cluster the amino acid sequences in groups of 30%
identity over 90% of their length [12]. To improve selection analysis accuracy and power, only clusters containing
10 or more sequences were included in further analyses
[13]. There were five clusters, named for the majority of
the sequences contained within each one, chosen for further analysis: FoxA, FoxD, FoxI, FoxO and FoxP (see Additional file 1).
Alignment and Phylogenetic Analysis
Each cluster was aligned independently using a combination of CLUSTALX1.83 [14] and CLUSTALW1.81 [15] (see
Additional file 2). Amino acid sequences were aligned
rather than nucleotide sequences so that gaps would not
be introduced into the corresponding codons. The amino
acid alignments were converted into nucleotide alignments, for phylogeny creation, utilizing the proteins' corresponding nucleotide sequences from GenBank with the
program protal2dna2.0 [16]. The nucleotide alignment
was then converted to nexus format with the ReadSeq2.93
[17] program for phylogenetic analysis.

MrModeltest2.2 [18] was used in conjunction with
PAUP4.0b10 [19] to determine the best nucleotide substitution model for each cluster. The model chosen by the
Akaike Information Criterion measure in MrModeltest
was implemented in MrBayes3.1.1 [20] for each cluster.
All priors were uninformative and set at default values.
Each analysis was run for 1000000 generations, sampling
every 100th generation for a total of 10001 samples. A
burn-in value, the number of initial samples removed
from analysis, of 3000 was chosen based on previous

Page 2 of 13

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:261

analyses. The generation versus log probability plots were
examined to ensure convergence was reached and that a
burn-in of 3000 was appropriate. The potential scale
reduction factor was also used as a measure of convergence [21].
Identification of Selection Pressures
Values of ω were estimated for each non-ambiguous
codon in the alignment using the codeml program contained in the PAML3.15 package [22]. Codon site models
M0, M3, M1a, M2a, M7 and M8 that estimate ω, were
implemented for each cluster [23-26]. Model M0 allows
only one category of ω for all sites. Model M3 allowed
three unconstrained ω categories, ω1, ω2 and ω3 with proportions p1, p2 and p3 = 1-p1-p2. Model M1a contains two
categories of ω, 0 < ω0 < 1 and ω1 = 1 with proportions p0
and p1 = 1-p0. Model M2a adds a third category, ωs > 1
with proportion ps such that ps = 1-p0-p1. Models M7 and
M8 both contain 10 equal proportion ω categories
approximated from β(p, q) with 0< ω < 1 while Model M8
adds an additional ω category, ωs > 1. The proportion of
sites with ω ~ β(p, q) is represented by p0 and those with
ωs > 1 are represented by ps where ps = 1-p0. Each site is
assigned to an ω category using a naïve empirical Bayes
(NEB) (models M0, M3, M1a and M7) [27] or Bayes
empirical Bayes (BEB) (models M2a and M8) [26]
approach.

Codon frequencies were set as free parameters (CodonFreq = 3) and ambiguous columns in the alignment were
removed from the analysis. The transition/transversion
ratio and branch lengths were estimated from the data
using maximum likelihood methods. Two separate analyses were conducted with initial values of 0.4 and 2.0 for ω
to identify and avoid local optima [13,23]. Each analysis
was repeated once. Comparison of the results for each
model using ω = 0.4 and ω = 2 and their repeats revealed
that parameter estimates (ln likelihood, p, ω and β(p, q))
for each model were identical when rounded to three decimal places. The accuracy and power of selection analysis
are good if different models are tested, initial values of ω
are varied and the analysis is consistent when repeated
[23].
A likelihood ratio test (LRT) comparing M0 and M3
using a χ2 distribution with four degrees of freedom was
used as a test for variation in ω among sites [28,29]. Two
LRTs were used as a test for positive selection, M1a
against M2a and M7 against M8, each using a χ2 distribution with two degrees of freedom [25,27]. The LRTs were
considered significant when the P-value was ≤ 0.05. The
critical values are 9.49 and 5.99 for four and two degrees
of freedom respectively when P = 0.05. A correction for
multiple tests was not performed as the two LRTs for positive selection test the fit of different distributions of ω to
the data and are therefore performed for robustness [30].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/261

If positive selection occurs in only a few lineages in a tree,
it may not be identified using site models, therefore
branch-site model A, which allows for ω > 1 along a specified lineage, the foreground branch, while ω cannot be
greater than one in any of the other lineages, the background branches [31] was applied. This model was implemented for lineages leading to parologous clades in the
FoxA, FoxD, FoxO and FoxP clusters as positive selection
is a potential evolutionary force driving subfamily paralog
functional differentiation. The FoxI cluster was not examined as no lineages of interest were identified. Model A
contains four classes of sites; class 0: 0 < ω0 < 1 and class
1: ω1 = 1, with proportions p0 and p1 respectively, for both
the foreground and background branches and class 2a or
2b: ω2 ≥ 1 for the foreground branch with corresponding
sites in the background lineage falling into class 2a: 0 < ω0
< 1 or class 2b: ω1 = 1 site classes with proportions (1-p0p1)p0/(p0+p1) and (1-p0-p1)p1/(p0+p1) respectively. All
other parameters and running conditions were set as
described for the site models. Model A is compared to a
null model A with ω2 = 1 fixed, using a LRT and χ2 distribution with one degree of freedom. Statistical significance
at α = 0.05 was determined after correction for multiple
tests using Rom's procedure and the Bonferroni correction
when multiple branches were tested in a phylogeny [32].
If significance was obtained through Rom's procedure but
not the more stringent Bonferroni correction, the LRT was
referred to as potentially positive. BEB is used to identify
sites under positive selection if the LRT is significant and
ω2 > 1.
Identification of EH1 Motifs
The Engrailed Homology 1 (EH1) motif has previously
been identified in many, but not all of the sequences
included in this analysis [33,34]. Visual examination of
the sequence alignments in conjunction with known EH1
locations suggested that there were EH1 motifs present in
the sequences included in this analysis that have not been
previously reported. A Perl script was written to search all
of the sequences included in this analysis for the EH1
motif of the form XXaXbXXcdXX where X can be any
amino acid, a can be Phe, His, Tyr or Trp, b and c can be
Ile, Leu or Val and d can be Glu, Phe, His, Ile, Lys, Met,
Gln, Arg, Trp or Tyr [33,35]. Sequences with newly identified EH1 motifs are indicated in Additional file 1 and the
locations of the motifs can be found in Additional file
3(A-E).

Results
Branch-Site Analysis
Figure 1 shows the branches that were tested for positive
selection in each of the gene clusters. LRTs (Table 1) were
significant for branches leading to the FoxA3 and Protostomia clades in the FoxA cluster and the FoxD2 lineage in
the FoxD cluster and potentially significant for the FoxD1/
2/4 lineage in the FoxD cluster and the FoxO3 lineage in

Branches tested for positive selection using branch-site models. In each phylogeny the branches tested are indicated
with red stars and labels representing the clade of interest. The trees in which positive selection was identified were rooted
using a set of FoxC genes as an outgroup in conjunction with neighbor joining tree creation, after branch-site analysis for clarity
into evolutionary relationships. Clade credibility values less than 0.95 are indicated on the unrooted trees. The phylogenies are
for the gene clusters as follows; A. FoxA B. FoxD C. FoxO D. FoxP.

the FoxO cluster, suggesting that positive selection has
acted in the diversification of these paralogs from other
genes in the cluster. Model A parameter estimates for lineages under positive selection are given in Table 2. Positive selection was not identified in any of the other
lineages tested.

In the FoxD2 clade one positively selected site occurs
between the forkhead domain and the EH1 motif in a
region that has not been functionally characterized while
the remaining positively selected sites identified in this
lineage and that identified in the FoxD1/2/4 lineage occur
within the EH1 motif as identified in the FoxD1, FoxD3

and FoxD5 sequences (see Additional file 3(B)). The LRT
for the FoxD1/2/4 branch was potentially significant and
the amino acid residues at the positively selected site identified in the FoxD1/2/4 lineage differ only in the FoxD2
lineage and are otherwise 100 percent conserved in the
other sequences analyzed, therefore it is unlikely that positive selection acted along the FoxD1/2/4 lineage. The
FoxD2 lineage sequences contain an EH1 motif however
it was not aligned with that identified in the FoxD1,
FoxD3 or FoxD5 sequences due to additional amino
acids, some of which were under positive selection, found
in the FoxD2 lineage. It is likely that the positive selection
identified in the FoxD2 lineage within this region is due
to the high conservation of the EH1 motif in the other
sequences analyzed and lack of motif alignment and not
due to evolutionary forces.
Site Analysis
Codon site models M0, M1a, M2a, M3, M7 and M8 were
implemented in codeml for each of the six clusters and
compared using likelihood ratio tests. For each cluster the
M3 vs. M0 LRT was significant (Table 3), indicating that
one category of ω was insufficient to describe the variability in selection pressure across amino acid sites. LRTs testing for positive selection, M2a vs M1a and M8 vs M7, were
also insignificant for each cluster (Table 3), therefore the
amino acid changes within each cluster are neutral or

under negative selection. Table 4 reports the parameter
estimates for the least parameter rich model, M1a, which
best describes the variation in selection pressures across
sites. Graphs were constructed showing the posterior
weighted ω, the mean of ω over the site classes weighted
by the posterior probability of each class, of each residue
analyzed (Figure 2). Since ambiguous sites were removed,
the residue numbers along the bottom of the graphs do
not correspond to residue numbers of the analyzed
sequences. Underneath each graph is a cartoon of the
important regions contained in human forkhead gene(s)
within that cluster. Few functional regions have been
examined in human FoxA and FoxP proteins therefore
functional information identified in rat and mouse protein studies has been included in the FoxA and FoxP figures respectively. The location of the forkhead domain for
each human sequence was taken from the NCBI Entrez
Protein [11] database record for that sequence.

Discussion
Prediction of Functional and Nonfunctional Residues
Using Site Analysis
The site methods described in this paper may be used to
predict functionally important residues in gene family
members. If a functional domain has been identified in
one member of a gene family, but not in a different member and the functional domain is under strong negative

selection, prediction of a similarly functioning domain
may be made in the family member where a domain has
not been identified. In support of this theory, the forkhead domain, which is most likely functionally active in
all of the sequences analyzed, was under strong negative
selection in each cluster. We were able to predict functional domains in the FoxA, FoxO and FoxP cluster
sequences.
In the FoxA cluster conserved domain II has been shown
to be involved in transactivation [36] and repression [37]
in rat FoxA2. Since conserved domain II is entirely under
strong negative selection (Figure 2A) and contained only
one ambiguous column in the alignment (see Additional
file 3(A)), it is likely functionally important in all of the
sequences analyzed. In the FoxO cluster, a transactivation
domain has been identified at the C-terminus of FOXO1a
and FOXO4 [38,39] while a transactivation domain has
yet to be identified in FOXO3a. A portion of the C-terminal transactivation domain in FOXO4 and the entire
transactivation domain in FOXO1a was under strong
negative selection (Figure 2D), therefore a C-terminal
transactivation domain consisting of the negatively
selected residues (sites 389–428 in Figure 2D, residues
605–673 in FOXO3a) may be predicted in FOXO3a. A
second, weaker, transactivation domain was identified in
FOXO4 between the forkhead domain and the C-terminal transactivation domain [38]. This region is not highly
conserved, although small islands of consecutive columns without gaps in the alignment that show strong
negative selection, i.e. sites 315–326 in Figure 2D, may be
functionally important. C-terminal deletions of PAX3FOXO1a (a fusion protein consisting of the PAX3 N-terminal region, which includes two DNA binding domains,
to the C-terminal region of FOXO1a, that includes part of
the forkhead domain and the C-terminal transactivation
domain) that include residues within FOXO1a corresponding to the FOXO4 transactivation domain have
also shown reduced transactivation [40,41]. The residues
under negative selection in this region may be key to the
transactivation function seen in FOXO1a and FOXO4,

and residues of FOXO3a within this region may also
show transactivation function. A N-terminal NES and a
NLS at the N-terminus of the forkhead domain have been
identified in FOXO1a [42] and were found to be under
strong negative selection (Figure 2D). These regions have
not been examined for NES or NLS function in FOXO3a
and FOXO4. The strong negative selection of these
regions suggests that a NES may be found in the N-terminus and an NLS at the N-terminus of the forkhead
domain in all of the sequences analyzed. Similarly, three
phosphorylation sites involved in cellular localization
have been identified in FOXO1a, Ser322, Ser325 and
Ser329 and have not been examined in FOXO3a and
FOXO4 [43,44]. The Foxo6_mmus sequence was the only
sequence that did not contain serines at these three positions (see Additional file 3(D)) suggesting that these serines may be functionally important in the other
sequences analyzed with the exception of Foxo6_mmus.
Broadly defined NLSs have also been described C-terminal to the forkhead domain in FOXO1a [45] and FOXO4
[46]. A NLS has not been defined in FOXO3a, however
residues Arg248ArgArg and Lys269LysLys have been
shown to function in nuclear localization [47]. This
region is under strong negative selection, with the exception of one site, 181 in Figure 2D, which is under very
weak negative selection, suggesting that a NLS may be
found at this point in all of the sequences analyzed.
Finally, there are three common phosphorylation sites
among the FOXO proteins (sites 20, 157 and 216 in Figure 2D) and two 14-3-3 protein binding sites (sites 17–
22 and 153–159 in Figure 2D) that are important in cytoplasmic/nuclear localization and therefore transactivation activity [42,45-57]. These phosphorylation and 143-3 binding sites were are all highly conserved among
species and under strong negative selection suggesting
functional importance in all of the sequences analyzed.
Within the FoxP cluster the leucine zipper and zinc finger
identified in FOXP1 and mouse Foxp1, Foxp2 and Foxp4
[58-61] were under strong negative selection suggesting
that they are present in the other sequences analyzed
(Figure 2E). The leucine zipper allows FoxP proteins to

form homo- and hetero-dimers [59,60] and although the
zinc finger function has yet to be determined, it has been
suggested that it aids in dimer formation [60].
Additionally, functional domains may be predicted in
regions under strong negative selection where a domain is
not known to exist. For example, functionally important
residues have not been identified in the N-terminus of
FOXD proteins and a series of amino acids under strong
negative selection is found in this region (Figure 2B). This
series of negatively selected amino acids may be functionally important and forms a starting point to identifying
functionally important residues outside of the forkhead
domain in the FOXD proteins. Predicting functionally
important residues with these methods provides a specific
region of amino acids and potential domain boundaries
that should be tested when searching for functional
domains in vitro.
When a functional region has been identified in one gene
family member, but the majority of the amino acids making up the functional region are aligned with gaps and/or
are experiencing neutral changes, the region is likely not
functioning in the same manner in the other sequences
analyzed. Examples include conserved domains IV and V
in the FoxA cluster and the transactivation domain in the
FoxI cluster (Figure 2A, C, see Additional file 3(A, C)).
This method identifies a region of amino acids that are
less likely to be important for a specific function, which
may then be examined last for functional significance
when using in vitro methods.
Refining Domain Boundaries Using Site Analysis
Domain boundaries are often identified by sequence
comparison to functionally related proteins or through
mutagenesis experiments. When comparing sequences, it
is assumed that the domain boundaries are accurately
defined in the protein to which the comparison is made.
Often, the boundaries of a new domain are loosely
defined through mutagenesis experiments, as it is too
time consuming to examine every amino acid near the
suspected boundary for functional contribution. These
loosely defined domains are then used by other researches
in sequence comparisons to identify domains in related

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/261

proteins. The methods used in this paper provide a new in
silico procedure for identifying domain boundaries. For
example, residues 1–50 of FOXO1a have been identified
as a NES [42] however, only residues 8–32 were under
strong negative selection. This suggests that the functional
domain boundaries of the N-terminal NES in FOXO1a
may be redefined from residues 1 and 50 to residues 8 and
32. Molecular analysis is necessary to confirm the reallocation of domain boundaries.
The assigned boundaries of the forkhead domain vary
from source to source. The NCBI Conserved Domain
Database (CDD) definition of the forkhead domain,
which was taken from the SMART database forkhead definition, was used in this paper. In this definition, the
boundaries of the forkhead domain are defined by tertiary
structure and sequence comparison of all known forkhead
domains [62]. Since the C-terminal end of the forkhead
domain is unstructured and variable among subfamilies
[63-67], this region is excluded from the CDD forkhead
domain definition even though it is involved in DNA
binding [68-70]. When a new protein containing a forkhead domain is described in the literature, the forkhead
domain is often identified through sequence comparison
to the rat FoxA1 forkhead domain, the first forkhead
domain containing protein identified in mammals [71].
The rat FoxA1 forkhead domain was broadly defined
through mutational analysis [71] and then succinctly
defined through sequence comparison to the rat FoxA2,
FoxA3 and Drosophila Fork Head proteins [72,73]. When a
forkhead domain is defined through sequence comparison to rat FoxA1, the N- and C-terminal domain boundaries vary within the gene family and subfamilies while the
CDD definition of the forkhead domain is consistent
among gene family members. The N- and C-terminal
domain boundaries include additional amino acids when
defined through sequence comparison to rat FoxA1 as
compared to the CDD definition. In this analysis, a series
of residues directly adjacent to the N- and C-termini of the
forkhead domain in each of the clusters analyzed (Figure
2) were under strong negative selection, suggesting that
the forkhead domain definition should include these residues. The forkhead domain definitions supplied in the
literature often accounted for some of the negatively
selected sites not included in the CDD forkhead definition; however, the literature definitions either included
sites that were not conserved among species, included
sites with neutral changes, did not include all of the sites
under negative selection and all varied in their start and
stop points within subfamilies. If the N- and C-terminal
boundaries of a domain are defined as the first and last
residue respectively of a series of residues under strong
negative selection, the results will be reproducible and
consistent among gene family or subfamily members.

Identification of Amino Acids Involved in Paralog or
Ortholog Differentiation
The branch-site and site analysis of selection pressures on
codons conducted here have identified specific amino
acids responsible for differentiation of paralogs in the
FoxA and FoxO clusters and orthologs in the FoxA cluster.
In the FoxA cluster, the region N-terminal to the forkhead
domain appears to contribute to paralog differentiation.
One positively selected site identified in the FoxA3 clade
occurs within conserved domain IV and one positively
selected site identified in the Protostomia lineage occurs
within conserved domain V as both domains are defined
in FoxA2 [74] (see Additional file 3(A)). Overall conserved domains IV and V, which have been shown to play
a role in transactivation in FoxA2 proteins [74], are not
well conserved in the FoxA3 or Protostomia proteins as
compared to the FoxA1 and FoxA2 proteins as the majority of the residues making up these domains were not analyzed due to gaps in the alignment and those that were
examined by site analysis show variability in selection
pressure with most of the sites, 5/7, having experienced
neutral changes (Figure 2A). Additional sites under positive selection N-terminal to the forkhead domain were
also identified through branch-site analysis in the FoxA3
and Protostomia lineages (see Additional file 3(A)). Two
of these sites in the FoxA3 lineage occur in a nuclear localization signal (NLS) that was broadly defined in rat FoxA2
[74] while the other positively selected sites are found in
regions uncharacterized in any FoxA protein. FoxA1 and
FoxA2 have more similar expression patterns and functions during development and metabolism as compared
to the FoxA3 proteins (reviewed by [75]). This evidence in
conjunction with the positive selection identified here
suggests that the N-terminal region of sequences not
included in the FoxA1 or FoxA2 clades have evolved to differentiate these proteins from the FoxA1 and FoxA2 proteins while the sequences were conserved in the FoxA1
and FoxA2 proteins leading to overlapping expression and
function.

Conserved domain III, which has been shown to function
in transactivation in rat FoxA2 [36] contained many
ambiguous sites in the FoxA alignment (see Additional
file 3(A)) due to sequences from the Protostomia lineage
and variations in selection pressure were observed in the
four sites, through site analysis, that did contain amino
acids from these species (Figure 2A). This suggests that
conserved domain III is important for FoxA function in
the Deuterostomia but not in the Protostomia and that
the FoxA genes in the two lineages have evolved to perform species specific functions. Therefore the presence of
conserved domain III may differentiate FoxA orthologs
between the Protostomia and Deuterostomia lineages.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/261

In the FoxO cluster, the NES(s) located between the forkhead domain and the C-terminus in the FOXO1a,
FOXO3a and FOXO4 sequences [42,46,47,76] are not
highly conserved among the FoxO family members as
their alignment was not well defined, only three sites,
250–252, in Figure 2D contain NES residues from each of
the three human FOXO proteins examined and some residues have experienced neutral changes as demonstrated
by site analysis. These NES(s) may be used to differentiate
FoxO paralogs.
Only one site was found to be under positive selection in
the FoxO3 lineage during branch-site analysis and the LRT
was potentially significant. This residue is found in a
region important for nuclear localization, C-terminal to
the forkhead domain (see Additional file 3(C)). The
amino acid located at the positively selected site is serine
in the FoxO3 sequences while it is glycine, alanine or
aspartic acid in the other sequences analyzed. The presence of serine at this position may be important for regulation of the FoxO3 proteins by phosphorylation and this
regulation may be different from the other FoxO
sequences analyzed. Molecular testing is required to validate this hypothesis.
In summary, residues that differentiate paralogs were
identified in the FoxA and FoxO clusters while residues
that differentiate orthologs were also identified in the
FoxA cluster. This information provided insights into the
evolution of these two subfamilies. Within the FoxD,
FoxI, and FoxP clusters, residues that differentiate
orthologs or paralogs were unidentifiable due to lack of
functional information (FoxD and FoxI clusters only) and
overall negative selection in the identified domains.
Subfamily Evolution
Forkhead subfamilies are defined by their homology in
the forkhead domain alone. Here we analyzed the entire
coding regions of forkhead proteins and found that the
subfamily structures were maintained after sequence analysis with BLASTCLUST. Our site analysis also demonstrated distinct regions of homology outside the forkhead
domain in each of the clusters analyzed, further supporting the subfamily member evolutionary relationships
defined by the forkhead domain alone.

The patterns of strong negative and neutral selection
observed through site analysis in each of the clusters and
through branch-site analysis along the majority of the lineages tested, indicate that after gene duplication, rapid differentiation of paralogs through codon changes and
subsequent maintenance, negative selection, of these
changes has occurred. The lack of positive selection
observed through site analysis indicates that the functions

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:261

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/261

of forkhead gene family members as we see them today
have been determined and fixed in the species analyzed.
However, the positive selection observed along select lineages in the FoxA and FoxO cluster indicate more recent
or observable continuing functional divergence. While the
majority of studies that have used these methods focus
only on positive selection, a few involving transcription
factor gene families have discussed negative selection as
well. Our results are similar to those seen in a comparable
analysis of HOX7 where heterogeneous selection pressures but not positive selection were observed during site
analysis and positive selection was observed on a single
branch separating paralogs during branch-site analysis
[77]. These types of analysis of gene families that were
originally defined by a common functional motif may
confirm or refute the family relationships and provide
insights into their evolutionary development. If positive
selection is observed it suggests that the evolutionary
changes are ortholog or paralog differentiating while negative selection indicates that the protein function is conserved among species.
Forkhead Domain Evolution
As forkhead subfamilies are defined by and forkhead gene
function is reliant on the forkhead domain, identification
of selection pressures acting on codons within the domain
provides insights into the functional evolution of subfamilies and their paralogs. In each of the subfamilies, the
majority of the residues in the forkhead domain were
under strong negative selection (Figure 2) consistent with
the general consensus that the domain is highly conserved
and important for proper gene function. More interestingly, sites under positive selection and neutral changes
were observed in the forkhead domain in some subfamilies and these provide insights into the evolutionary
differentiation of forkhead genes.

In the FoxA cluster Protostomia lineage a number of residues under positive selection were found in the forkhead
domain through branch-site analysis. These residues are
located within helix 2, β-sheet 2 and wing 1 as defined by
the crystal structure of FoxA3 [63] (Figure 3, see Additional file 3(A)). The residues corresponding to the positively selected sites in the Protostomia lineage are 100
percent conserved among the other sequences analyzed. It
is possible that these changes in amino acid composition
of the forkhead domain alter the domain configuration
thus allowing for different target binding and/or regulation of FoxA genes in the Protostomia as compared to the
Deuterostomia. It is interesting to note that to date, in
most Protostomia only one FoxA class gene has been
identified while in the Deuterostomia, multiple FoxA
class genes have been found. If FoxA targets are similar in
the Protostomia and Deuterostomia lineages, the altera-

tions in the forkhead domain of Protostomia FoxA may
allow these single proteins to perform the same function
that require multiple FoxA proteins in the Deuterostomia.
This theory is further supported by the differences
observed in the N-terminal region of the Protostomia
FoxA and in conserved domain III as compared to the
Deuterostomia discussed earlier.
One residue within the forkhead domain was experiencing neutral changes in the FoxA, FoxD and FoxP clusters
(Figures 2A (site 41), 2B (site 74), 2E (site 451)). The locations of the residues with neutral changes are shown on
the FoxA3 crystal structure in Figure 3. The sites experienc-

ing neutral changes identified in the FoxA and FoxP clusters were found at the C-terminus of alpha helix 1 while
the site experiencing neutral changes in the FoxD cluster
was located near the C-terminus of alpha helix 2. Neutral
changes at a site imply that any amino acid may be present
at that site and amino acid changes will not affect protein
function. In support of this theory, mutation of the site
corresponding to the neutral site identified in the FoxD
cluster in rat FoxA3 from aspartate to lysine did not affect
DNA binding [68]. The sites with neutral changes identified in the FoxA, FoxD and FoxP clusters and the corresponding sites in other Fox proteins have not been
associated with point mutations causing human disease
and have not been shown to contact DNA during DNA
binding. The NCBI Entrez SNP database [11], Build 126,
was used to determine if the sites with neutral changes
have naturally occurring single nucleotide polymorphisms in any of the forkhead genes found in humans.
Only one forkhead gene, FOXD4, has a known SNP at a
location corresponding to one of the sites with neutral
changes. The SNP identified in FOXD4 corresponds to the
neutrally changed site identified in the FoxD proteins and
is either aspartate or glycine. It would be interesting to
determine if amino acid changes at these sites affect forkhead domain function and if the neutrally changed sites
are common to the forkhead domain or specific to the
subfamilies in which they were identified.
The variations from negative selection in the forkhead
domain identified here may account for differences in
subfamily and paralog function that are not explained by
differences in timing or location of expression or other
functional regions in the proteins.

Conclusion
This analysis has provided insights into forkhead gene
family and subfamily evolution. Through identification of
selection pressures we provided evidence for the functional and evolutionary importance of amino acid differences in paralogs and orthologs of FOX subfamilies. Our
work has also supported the forkhead subfamily structure
and identified a pattern of evolution in the family. Additionally, our analyses allowed evaluation and extension of
domain structural and positional information between
gene family members. Future in vitro studies may use this
information as a starting point or for refinement of protein functional analysis.
