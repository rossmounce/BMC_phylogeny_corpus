Abstract
Background: Plants involved in highly complex and well-coordinated systems have evolved a considerable degree
of developmental plasticity, thus minimizing the damage caused by stress. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have recently
emerged as key regulators in gene regulation, developmental processes and stress tolerance in plants.
Results: In this study, soybean miRNAs associated with stress responses (drought, salinity, and alkalinity) have been
identified and analyzed in combination with deep sequencing technology and in-depth bioinformatics analysis.
One hundred and thirty three conserved miRNAs representing 95 miRNA families were expressed in soybeans
under three treatments. In addition, 71, 50, and 45 miRNAs are either uniquely or differently expressed under
drought, salinity, and alkalinity, respectively, suggesting that many miRNAs are inducible and are differentially
expressed in response to certain stress.
Conclusion: Our study has important implications for further identification of gene regulation under abiotic
stresses and significantly contributes a complete profile of miRNAs in Glycine max.

Background
Terrestrial plants face serious abiotic stresses (e.g.
drought, salinity, alkalinity, cold, pathogen responses
and diseases), these are the predominant cause of
decreased crop yields [1]. Being one of the major oil
crops worldwide, Glycine max faces these challenges
posed by environmental stressors. To cope with environmental stresses, crops have evolved sophisticated
adaptive response mechanisms [2]. Therefore, unraveling
the complex resistant mechanisms of soybeans will provide fundamental insights into the biological processes
involved in environmental stimuli, which may prove
helpful in alleviating crop losses.
There is increasing evidence that microRNAs (miRNAs), ~21 nucleotides (nt) in length, act as key factors
in gene regulation, developmental processes and stress
tolerance in plants [3-5]. MiRNAs function by either
cleaving their targets (mRNAs predominantly via RISC)

or repressing protein translation [6,7]. Indeed, it has
been suggested that a number of miRNAs that participate in stress responses have adapted to environmental
challenges. For example, Phillips et al. [8] reported that
miR395, miR397b, and miR402 are involved in stress
response. Expression levels of miR393 changed under
salinity and alkaline stresses, however, over-expression
of miR393 is harmful to plants [9]. In response to environmental stresses, fluctuations in the expression of miRNAs can be induced by many uncontrolled factors, such
as drought, salinity, and alkalinity at transcriptional and
post-transcriptional levels. It was reported that sulfate
starvation lead to the up-regulation of miRNA395 [7]
miR398 and miR408 were responded to water deficiency
[10]. Furthermore, these inducible miRNAs display different specificity under different stresses. However, our
knowledge of the roles played by miRNAs under stress
conditions in plants is still limited, especially at the
whole-genome level.
In recent years, it has been possible to identify miRNAs through either bioinformatics or sequencing. For
instance, various methods have been used to identify
miRNAs in rice, wheat, and maize [11-13]. Many bioinformatics approaches and technologies have been

developed for rapid and accurate miRNA detection and
analysis. Recently, deep sequencing technology is showing significant promise for small RNA discovery and
genome wide transcriptome analysis at single-base pair
resolution [14]. In comparison with microarray, deep
sequencing has several advantages, the major one being
its application in comprehensively identifying and profiling small RNA populations that were previously
unknown. Deep sequencing has identified many small
RNAs in different plants, mutants, and tissues at various
developmental stages [15-18]. In this study, soybean
miRNAs associated with stress response were identified
and analyzed by high-throughput sequencing. One hundred and thirty three known miRNAs corresponding to
95 miRNA families were detected in soybeans under
three stress treatments. In addition, 71, 50, and 45 miRNAs were differentially expressed under drought, salinity, and alkalinity, respectively, suggesting that many
miRNAs are inducible and are differentially expressed
during different environmental stresses.

Results
General features of small RNA transcriptomes under
diverse treatments

Small RNAs were documented not only to modulate a
series of complex developmental events, but also to regulate defense under abiotic stress [19,20]. To explore
the small RNA pools from three stress treatments in
soybeans (mock, drought, salinity, and alkalinity), RNA
libraries were generated and sequenced by Solexa (Illumina). More than 36 million original sequencing tags
were produced with approximately 9-10 million raw
reads from each library. After discarding low quality, filtering 5’ contaminant and trimming 3’ adaptor reads, a
total of 8,500,978, 9,357,545, 9,003,582 and 9,223,744
clean reads were obtained from mock, drought, salinity
and alkalinity treated datasets, respectively (see Additional file 1). Although the total numbers of sequence
reads in four RNA libraries were similar, the size distribution of sequence tags was substantially different (Figure 1A, Additional file 2). For example, 2 182 055
(23.72% of clean reads from mock) sequences are canonical 21 nt small RNAs with the most abundant small
RNAs in the roots of mock samples. While 1 982 765, 1
929 505 and 1 476 829 reads of 21 nt were in the three
stressed libraries, accounting for 19.64% of clean reads
from drought, 20.22% of clean reads from salinity and
14.33% of clean reads from alkalinity, respectively. Small
RNAs varied widely in length and redundancy, the 24 nt
reads showed the highest redundancies (27.78%) in the
salinity induced library. The 24 nt reads constitute
25.90% and 22.14% in drought and mock libraries, while
they only account for 15.69% in the alkalinity induced
library. The relatively lower percentage of 24 nt reads

indicates that more kinds of miRNAs are involved in
the response of G. max to alkalinity compared with
other stress conditions. These data highlight the overall
complexity of the small RNA repertoire under different
stress conditions.
It is essential to generate a reference set of annotations
for exploring the small RNA categories. All identical
Solexa reads in each library were sorted into unique
sequence tags for further analysis. When aligned, all
sequences were read against the Glycine max genome
using SOAP2 [21], about 70% of reads matched perfectly
and 30% were from un-annotated genome sites with one
mismatch. For instance, in the mock, 7,045,434 (75.4%)
clean reads that grouped into 1,609,063 unique reads
were matched to the 1 115 Mb genome of Glycine max.
Subsequently, for each library approximately 60% of
clean small RNAs were identified as products processed
from rRNAs, tRNAs, snRNAs, or other non-coding
RNAs (Figure 1B). Another fraction (approximately
40%) was predominantly derived from un-annotated or
repeated sequences. Large portions of annotated small
RNAs were mainly non-coding RNAs. For the mock
group, 1 289 824 clean sequences which were classified
into 1,474 unique tags were considered to be potential
miRNAs. The other two induced by drought and salinity
were 1,393,901 (1,512 unique tags) and 1,302,431 (1,503
unique tags), respectively. Notably, in the alkalinityinduced group, 513,021 screened reads (1,062 unique

tags) were miRNA candidates, accounting for nearly half
of miRNAs of the former three groups. It is estimated
that known miRNAs might be the most abundant class
of small RNAs regulated at post-transcriptional levels in
plant defense.

miRNAs

Many miRNAs of the soybean have been reported in
previous studies. Kulcheski et al. [22] detected 256 miRNAs from drought-sensitive and tolerant seedlings and
rust-susceptible and resistant soybeans, of which 24
families of miRNAs had not been reported before. Song
et al. [15] identified 26 new miRNAs in developing soybean seeds by deep sequencing. Joshi [23] identified 129
miRNAs based on sequencing and bioinformatic analyses, among which, 42 miRNAs matched known miRNAs in soybean or other species, while 87 were novel
miRNAs. In another study Chen et al. [24], reported 15
conserved miRNA candidates belonging to eight different families and nine novel miRNA candidates comprising eight families in wild soybean seedlings. To identify
known miRNAs from the soybean in four diverse treatments, small RNA sequences were compared with miRBase 16.0. After a sequence similarity search, 133 known
miRNAs corresponding to 95 miRNA families were
identified in the soybean (Additional file 3). In addition,
four conserved star miRNAs (miR156d*, miR157b*,
miR162*, and miR3630*) have also been sequenced.
Among them, miR156d*, miR157b*, and miR3630* star
sequence expressions were rather low. However, the
abundance of miR162* ranged from 125 to 220 reads
under different treatments. In addition, other star miRNAs expression levels were low under all four conditions, these were miR172b*, miR156h*, and miR166g*.
Other studies showed that miRNAs are often evolutionarily conserved throughout the plants [25,26]. Hence,
we investigated the evolutionary conservation features of
the identified miRNAs in soybean by comparing them
to Arabidopsis thaliana, rice, Zea mays, Medicago truncatula, Sorghum bicolor, Triticum aestivum, Vitis vinifera, brassica and Pinus according to their sequence
similarity (data not shown). The identified miRNA
families are conserved in a variety of plant species. One
hundred and ten miRNA genes were reported in Glycine
max, the other 23 genes were detected from known
orthologous miRNAs.
The sequencing frequencies for miRNAs in our four
libraries were used as an index for estimating the relative abundance of 133 miRNAs. The distribution patterns of miRNA frequencies varied greatly, indicating
that these miRNAs were expressed ubiquitously in each
library. Three abundant miRNA reads (miR166,
miR1507, and miR3522) occupied 79.47% of expressed
miRNA tags on average (Figure 2, Additional file 4 and

Additional file 5). The identified miRNA families are
conserved in a variety of plant species in our study. For
example, families of miR156, miR1507, and miR3522 are
widely conserved in 10, 3, and 1 species, respectively
(see Additional file 6). Most mature miRNAs identified
in the soybean were also detected in other plant species,
such as Arabidopsis [27], grapevine [28], and poplar
[29]. Especially those present in high abundance, such
as miR156, miR166, and miR167. Of these, miR166 was
the most abundant (with sequence reads of 263 470
times under drought). Previous studies revealed that
miRNAs with high expression levels always correlate
with evolutionary conservation [25,30]. In this study, the
majority of miRNAs occurring at low frequencies, with
no more than 100 read tags, such as miR408 and
miR1517, showed poor conservation. Nevertheless, the
miRNAs with the least sequence reads, including
miR169g, miR171b, and miR393b, were sequenced dozens of times but were conserved in 9, 17 and 8 plant
species, respectively (Figure 3). MiR171b expressed in
the mock and miR393b expressed in drought were
sequenced 21 and 0 times, respectively. These observations suggest that conserved miRNAs may be essential
for controlling basic cellular and developmental pathways (e.g. cell cycle) in plants.
To validate the expression pattern of miRNAs by deep
sequencing, we randomly selected ten miRNAs
(miR156f, miR167d, miR169d, miR393a, miR394a,
miR482, miR1507a, miR1508b, miR4369, and miR4397)
to perform verification by qRT-PCR. Expression

conditions, which occurred most frequently with both
methods, were miR167d, miR169d, miR482, miR1507a,
miR1508b and miR4369. Only miR393a had shown to
be not in accordance with Solexa result. MiR394a was
down-regulated and exhibited an identical pattern in
both methods. These highly concordant results between
two methods suggest qRT-PCR validation indicated a
good concordance of both methods (Figure 3).
Novel miRNAs in soybean

From the four small RNA libraries, 102 miRNAs were
revealed as possible miRNA candidates of soybean. To
support the existence of the novel miRNAs, their hairpin structures and free energies were used to evaluate

these candidate miRNAs. We identified 50 novel miRNAs, with the 10 most highly expressed candidates
listed in Table 1, and the others in Additional file 7.
The energy scope of these miRNAs ranged from 70.8
kcal/mol (Gma-050) to -24.2 kcal/mol (Gma-013). The
expression levels of these candidates ranged broadly,
from thousands of sequence counts to single sequence
counts. Most mature sequences were products of a steploop structure at both 5’ and 3’ mediated by Dicer-like
enzymes. Novel miRNAs, including Gma-m0004, Gmam008, Gma-m009, Gma-m011, and Gma-m030, were
identified at both the 3’ and 5’ ends of hairpins. The 5’
read tags displayed very small read counts compared
with 3’ tags. Gma-m045, Gma-m046, Gma-m030, and
Gma-m050 showed nearly equal numbers of sequence
reads originating from both arms of the miRNA precursors. Eleven miRNAs, including Gma-m006, had a

higher number of sequence reads originating from the 5’
arm than the annotated mature miRNA containing 3’
arm, suggesting that the majority of miRNA genes processed by DCL have a strand bias in plants.
In comparison with these conserved miRNAs, all the
novel miRNA tags had low read counts in the four
libraries, where the highest is only 4 830 at 5’ end
(Gma-001). The least is only one at 3’ and 5’ end (e.g.
Gma-011, Gma-023, Gma-025, Gma-026, Gma-037,
Gma-039, Gma-040, Gma-047), and the average read
count was 318. It is well known that conserved miRNAs
are highly expressed frequently and ubiquitously
whereas non-conserved miRNAs are not. Further experimentation is needed to determine whether these novel
miRNAs are stress induced.
MiRNAs expression patterns under drought, salinity, and
alkalinity

To gain deep insight into environmental adaptation of
soybean, we studied common and unique miRNA
expression patterns under drought, salinity, and alkalinity conditions. As shown in Figure 4, miRNA expression varied in response to different stress-inducing
conditions. These genes were identified as functional
regulation factors in the resistance of stress. The
miRNA expression profiles observed revealed that a
small portion of miRNAs (miR434a, miR157b*, and

Page 6 of 12

miR171a) exhibited stress-specific expression patterns.
Moreover, all of the three miRNAs have low expression
abundance. Substantial portions of the miRNAs were
expressed under two or three stress conditions. For
example, miR156d*, miR160a, miR394a, miR1520j,
miR4341, miR4387a, miR4399, miR1520c, and miR1520r
appeared in three stress conditions while miR169g,
miR1517, and miR3630* appeared in two stress conditions. Therefore, some miRNA expressing intermediate
counts (e.g. miR160a and miR394a) and others had only
several reads (e.g. miR-156d*, miR169g, and miR393b).
The vast majority of the differentially expressed miRNAs showed different expression patterns either among
three conditions or between two stress conditions. Of
these, the expression of 78 miRNAs was significantly
different (fold change > 2; p < 0.05) (Figure 4), these
were congruously or differentially regulated under the
three stress conditions. In three stress conditions, 27
miRNAs (e.g. miR1520d, miR1520n, and miR4407) were
all up-regulated in comparison to the mock. For example, the expression level of miR4407 changed 3.67, 4.33,
and 4.67 folds in drought, salinity, and alkalinity, respectively. Fifty-one miRNAs showed different trends under
various inducing conditions (such as miR394a, miR4361,
miR4396, and miR4308), indicating that individual miRNAs may have distinctive expression patterns under different stress conditions. For example, miR394a was up-

with a fold change > 2 (e.g. miR169d), and 1, 4 and 8
were down-regulated with fold changes > -2 (e.g.
miR393a) in drought, salinity and alkalinity, respectively.
The expression profiles strongly indicate that different
miRNA regulation patterns might completely or partly
contribute to explaining the stress regulation between
various treatments.
MiRNA targets prediction

Investigation of the target mRNAs of the miRNAs identified can assist us in understanding their biological
roles [31,32]. In a previous study, Katara et al. [33], predicted 573 targets for 44 of the 69 mature miRNA
sequences published in the database. Study of affected
proteins revealed that more of the target protein products were involved in diverse physiological processes e.
g. photosynthesis [34]. Joshi [23] predicted the putative
target genes of 129 identified miRNAs with computational methods and verified the predicted cleavage sites
in vivo for a subset of these targets using the 5’ RACE

Page 7 of 12

method. In addition, the authors also studied the relationship between the abundance of miRNA and that of
the respective target genes by comparing their results to
Solexa cDNA sequencing data. In the study of Song et
al. [15], 145 were identified as targets of 38 known miRNAs and 8 new miRNAs and 25 genes. GO analysis
indicated that many of the identified miRNA targets
may function in soybean seed development To understand the relationship between the soybean the miRNAs
identified in the four treatments with previously published mRNAs, we utilized the psRNATarget program
for predicting mRNA targets of miRNAs. 1 219 mRNAs
were predicted to be targets for 126 miRNAs (Additional file 8, Additional file 9). Finally, 989 genes were
classified into 24 types annotated by COG (Figure 5).
The function of most mRNAs is translation, ribosomal
structure and biogenesis, and signal transduction
mechanisms. Furthermore, a variety of biological functions are involved in nucleotide transport and metabolism, transcription, defense mechanisms etc, which will
provide useful information about the regulatory roles of
miRNAs for different tolerances. These results demonstrate that the majority of targets fall into the category

of transcriptional regulation, indicating that these targets
encode transcription factors (e.g. target of miR169d:
CBF-B/NF-Y transcriptional factor). Some miRNAs,
such as gma-miR156f and gma-miR172d, have multiple
target sites, indicating that these miRNAs are functionally divergent. Additionally, a single gene may be targeted by several miRNAs, such as polyphenol oxidase,
which is regulated by gma-miR157b and gma-miR3522b.
Mature miRNA quantification by northern blotting

To confirm and validate the results obtained from the
Solexa library, we examined the expression patterns of
four known miRNAs and two novel miRNAs. These six
miRNAs (miR166b, miR169d, miR482b, miR1507a,
Gma-m001, and Gma-m002) were individually selected
and experimentally verified by northern blotting hybridization. The sequences of antisense RNA probes are
listed in Additional file 10. By comparing the miRNA
results by Solexa sequencing to northern hybridization,
three stress-responsive miRNAs (miR166b, miR169d,
and miR1507a) were identified with identical expression
patterns. MiR166b and MiR1507a were up-regulated
under drought, salinity, and alkalinity conditions.
MiR169d was up-regulated under drought and alkalinity
(Figure 6). While the expression patterns of miR482b
and Gma-m002 remained unchanged by the three stress
conditions when tested by northern blotting. However,
these were up-regulated under drought stress according
to the Solexa results. Based on the northern blot analysis, the expression level of Gma-m001 decreased under
salinity stress, but identical patterns were observed
under drought and alkalinity when compared with
Solexa sequencing (Figure 6). Therefore, the expression
pattern obtained by RNA blot analysis may reflect the
result from deep sequencing.

Discussion
Nowadays, characterization of the vital roles of miRNAs
play in plant stress responses is an active research field.
Although many studies have demonstrated that plant
miRNAs function as important regulators in development and morphogenesis processes, more reports are
indicating that plant miRNAs are also involved in environmental stress tolerance [7].
Since abiotic stress is one of the primary causes of
crop losses worldwide, unraveling the complex mechanisms underlying stress resistance of plants has profound
significance. Recently, the newly developed sequencing
technologies, such as the Illumina Genome Analyzer
(GA), Roche/454 FLX system, and the ABI SOLiD system, show advances over traditional methods with
improved throughput and dramatically reduced cost.
Currently, applications of high-throughput sequencing
technologies are arousing much research interest, such

differential expression of miRNAs. Total RNA (30 μg) from each of
the four conditions (mock, drought, salinity, and alkalinity) was
loaded and probed with miRNAs probe. The blot was hybridized
with six miRNAs (miR166b, miR169d, miR482b, miR1507a, Gmam001, and Gma-m002). The rRNA bands were shown as a loading
control. miR166b, miR169d, and miR1507a expressed identical
patterns when compared with Solexa sequencing.

as identification of entire sets of miRNAs, which deliver
new insights into the role of miRNAs in plant development, and stress related regulation. By using this
method, a number of soybean miRNAs have been well
annotated [34]. Differing from microarray, high throughput sequencing allows us to comprehensively survey
stress related miRNAs. To date, little is known about
the functions of miRNAs in abiotic stress responses in
Glycine max.
In this study, we sequenced and analyzed small RNAs
of the soybean under three treatments based on deep
sequencing. Investigation of the small RNAs showed
that gma-miR1507a (936 627 sequence tags) was represented in our sequencing libraries. One hundred and
thirty three known miRNAs and 50 novel miRNAs were
obtained from next generation sequencing data.
Through expression abundance of the miRNA repertoires under drought, salinity, and alkalinity stress conditions, many miRNAs were found to have a wide range
of expression levels between libraries. This characteristic
of variability in miRNA expression may be due to
miRNA mature processing [35], and/or stress associated
regulation [2,36]. We envision that these miRNAs might
have functional significance, suggesting they may

Li et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:170
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/170

participate in the plant stress response. Highly abundant
miRNAs seem to exhibit similar conservation. For
example, miR2188 and miR3522b exhibit high expression levels in all four libraries and are conserved across
many species. Such observations support previous
results that the most abundant miRNAs were phylogenetically conservative [37].
Both miRNAs and star miRNAs are generated from
step-loop hairpin structures. MiRNAs are stable and
participate in translational repression or cleavage of
mRNA by binding or anchoring to the coding region of
mRNA sequences [4]. Khvorova et al. [38] inferred from
the considerably low abundance of star miRNAs that
these strands are typically destroyed when released from
pre-miRNA stem. The low expression levels of star
miRNA sequences, such as miR156d*, miR157b*, and
miR3630*, further support the miRNA synthesis hypothesis. Next generation sequencing is a powerful tool in
the detection of miRNA and star miRNA [[15,39] and
[40]]. The correlation between star miRNA and its flexible expression may reveal its particular regulated function. MiR162* and miR482* may be involved in
regulating stress. Two arms of a single hairpin, giving
rise to RNA function isolation by different sequences,
may associate with distinct biological activities. Small
novel miRNAs annotated in our study, such as the 5’
and 3’ of Gma-004 and Gma006, were derived from predicted hairpin structures.
Plant miRNAs have been reported as having a strong
propensity towards regulating responses to abiotic stress,
including dehydration, freezing, salinity, alkalinity, and
other stresses by transcriptional factors or proteins [7].
Expression levels of miRNAs induced by environmental
stressors vary. They therefore may play a key role in targeting stress-regulated genes. It has been reported that
stress response miRNAs were ubiquitously present in
Populus [41], soybean [22], and other plants. Previous
studies have reported that members of miR167, miR319,
and miR393 were similarly regulated in stress tolerance
[9,42,43]. In this study, members of miR1520n,
miR4374b, and miR4396 were up-regulated simultaneously under three stresses, which implies that they
might target genes that function as negative regulators
of stress tolerance. In addition, it was previously
reported that miR395 was previously reported to be upregulated in a salt induced soybean line targeting sulfurylase and ASP1 genes under sulfate starvation conditions. Therefore, we speculate that miR395 might be
involved in non-specific salt-induced responding pathways, such as the maintenance of energy supply [7,13].
Moreover, miR166 is responsive to dehydration stress in
barley [44], and it is abundant and up-regulated in soybean seedlings under dehydration conditions. MiR393a,
targeting F-box proteins and a basic-helix-loop-helix

Page 9 of 12

family protein, was up-regulated in cold, dehydration,
salt, or ABA stress [7], and down-regulated in soybean
under alkaline stress. These responsive miRNAs are
involved in post-transcriptional regulation during stress
responsive processes.
Deep sequencing of the small RNA transcriptome
yields an incredible amount of data, from which we can
not only determine known miRNAs, but also successfully explore novel miRNAs with high accuracy and efficiency. First, in this study, we have identified 133 known
and 50 novel miRNAs in Glycine max, which illustrates
the diversity of miRNA expression in Glycine max,
revealing the presence of more miRNAs than previously
known. In addition, deep sequencing technologies in
combination with bioinformatics analysis enabled us to
profile the miRNA expression patterns for further
miRNA functional insights, and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms and diverse physiological
pathways. Second, comparing miRNA expression profiles under various induced conditions, we found significant differences in miRNA regulation patterns, with 71,
50, and 45 altered expression patterns under drought,
salinity, and alkalinity, respectively. The differentially
expressed miRNAs obtained in this study can serve as a
basis for further identification of the regulation roles of
stress tolerance in Glycine max.

Conclusion
In this study, soybean miRNAs associated with stress
responses (drought, salinity, and alkalinity) have been
identified and analyzed in combination with deep
sequencing technology and in-depth bioinformatics analysis. One hundred and thirty three conserved miRNAs
representing 95 miRNA families were expressed in soybeans under three treatments. In addition, 71, 50, and
45 miRNAs are either uniquely or differently expressed
under drought, salinity, and alkalinity, respectively, suggesting that many miRNAs are inducible and are differentially expressed in response to certain stress. This
study has important implications for further identification of gene regulation under abiotic stresses and significantly contributes a complete profile of miRNAs in
Glycine max.
Materials and methods
Sample collection and treatment

An inbred line of ‘HJ-1’, one of the abiotic stress sensitive soybeans, was used in our study. For each inbred
line, the uniform seeds were treated with ethanol for 10
minutes and then rinsed several times with sterile distilled water. These seeds were cultured in 1 × Hoagland’s nutrient solution (4 ml/L Fe-sequestrene, 6 mM
K+ and 4 mM Ca2+). When the four leaf stage was
reached, we began to put them under different stress

Li et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:170
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/170

treatments salt (120 mM NaCl), alkalinity (70 mM NaCl
and 50 mM NaHCO3) and drought (2% PEG) stress) for
48 hours, with the unstressed plants as a mock. Then
roots of 120 seedlings were collected and frozen in
liquid nitrogen for later use.
Small RNA sequencing library construction

The isolated RNA samples were purified on 15% PAGE
gel for size selection. Small RNAs, < 30 bases, were
ligated with a pair of Solexa sequencing adaptor primers
(5’-pUCGUAUGCCGUCUUCUGCUUGidT-3’ and 5’GUUCAGAGUUCUACAGUCCGACGAUC-3’) using
T4 RNA ligase. Ligated RNA was size-fractionated on a
10% agarose gel and the 70-90 nt fractions were amplified for 15 cycles to transform RNA to cDNA to produce sequencing libraries. The purified libraries with
approximately 20 mg of small RNA were used for cluster generation and sequencing analysis using the Solexa
sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. All the short reads were
deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI) and can be accessed in the Short
Read Archive (SRA) under the accession number
SRA045367.1.
Bioinformatics analysis

After Solexa sequencing, high-quality small RNA reads
were extracted from raw reads through filtering out the
low quality tags and eliminating contamination of adaptor sequences. The resulted set of unique sequences
with related read counts were deemed as clean sequence
tags. Matched sequences were then queried against noncoding RNAs (rRNA, tRNA, snRNA, and snoRNA) from
Rfam database using SOAP 2.0 program http://soap.
genomics.org.cn/. Any small RNA read matches to these
sequences were excluded from further analysis. Next, we
aligned all sequences against the miRBase16.0 again
http://mirbase.org/ using SOAP 2.0 to search for known
miRNAs with allowed mismatches (or > 90% identity).
To compare miRNA expression data under the four
diverse treatments, initially, each identified miRNA read
count was normalized to the total number of reads in
each given sample. Then, Bayesian method was applied
to evaluate the statistical significance (P value). After the
Bayesian test, if the P value ≤ 0.01 and the normalized
sequence counts changed more than two folds, the specific miRNA was considered to be differently expressed.
Reads that did not match any databases above were
marked as unannotated. To identify novel miRNA prediction, small RNA tags that matched miRBase and
Rfam were filtered and the remaining tags were aligned
with the Glycine max genome. To analyze whether the
matched sequence could form a suitable hairpin (the
secondary structure of the small RNA precursor),

Page 10 of 12

sequences surrounding the matched sequence were
extracted. The second structure was predicted by RNAfold http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/RNAfold.cgi.
Thereafter, novel miRNAs were identified using the
MIREAP program developed by the BGI (Beijing Genome Institute, http://sourceforge.net/projects/mireap/)
and mirTools [45]. The miRNA candidate targets were
predicted using psRNATarget http://bioinfo3.noble.org/
psRNATarget/. The COG (Clusters of Orthologous
Groups) terms of target genes were annotated by comparing with COGs from NCBI http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/COG.
MiRNA quantification by real-time PCR

Total RNA (1 μl) was used for synthetizing reverse
transcripts with One Step PrimeScript® miRNA cDNA
Synthesis Kit (Takara, Japan) in 20 μl reaction mixture.
The reaction was performed at 37°C for 60 min, 85°C
for 5 seconds following the manufacturer’s instruction.
RT-PCR was performed with SYBR ® Premix Ex Taq
II™ (Takara, Japan). Primers designed in Additional
file 11 were used to amplify specific miRNA. Soybean
5s rRNA was used as the endogenous control. UnimiR qPCR Primer was added as the common reverse
primer. The qRT-PCR reactions were carried out in a
final volume of 25 μl containing 12.5 μl SYBR® Premix
EX Taq™, 1 μl forward and reverse primers, and 2 μl
template. To estimate the relative abundance of miRNAs in stress induced samples, the Ct value was
directly compared and transformed into a fold-change
difference. These reactions were performed using the
ABI7300 (Applied Biosystems 7300 Real-Time PCR
System).
MiRNA verification by northern blot

For miRNAs quantification, northern blot hybridization
was conducted using the High Sensitive MiRNA Northern Blot Assay Kit (Signosis, USA). 30 μg total RNA of
each sample was electrophoresed on a 15% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to membrane (supplied by
Signosis). Antisense RNA biotin labeled in the 5’ end
(Invitrogen, China) was used for hybridization probes.
The Cyber Green ® II-stained (Biotech, China) rRNA
bands in the polyacrylamide gel are shown as a loading
control.
