Open Access

Ryanodine receptors, a family of intracellular
calcium ion channels, are expressed throughout
early vertebrate development
Houdini HT Wu, Caroline Brennan and Rachel Ashworth*

Abstract
Background: Calcium signals ([Ca2+]i) direct many aspects of embryo development but their regulation is not well
characterised. Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are a family of intracellular Ca2+ release channels that control the flux of
Ca2+ from internal stores into the cytosol. RyRs are primarily known for their role in excitation-contraction coupling
in adult striated muscle and ryr gene mutations are implicated in several human diseases. Current evidence
suggests that RyRs do not have a major role to play prior to organogenesis but regulate tissue differentiation.
Findings: The sequences of the five zebrafish ryr genes were confirmed, their evolutionary relationship established
and the primary sequences compared to other vertebrates, including humans. RyRs are differentially expressed in
slow (ryr1a), fast (ryr3) and both types (ryr1b) of developing skeletal muscle. There are two ryr2 genes (ryr2a and
ryr2b) which are expressed exclusively in developing CNS and cardiac tissue, respectively. In addition, ryr3 and ryr2a
mRNA is detectable in the initial stages of development, prior to embryonic axis formation.
Conclusions: Our work reveals that zebrafish ryr genes are differentially expressed throughout the developing
embryo from cleavage onwards. The data suggests that RyR-regulated Ca2+ signals are associated with several
aspects of embryonic development, from organogenesis through to the differentiation of the musculoskeletal,
cardiovascular and nervous system. These studies will facilitate further work to explore the developmental function
of RyRs in each of these tissue types.

Background
Transient changes in the concentration of intracellular
calcium ions ([Ca2+ ] i ) act as a powerful signal that is
crucial for the establishment of form and function in
the embryo. Detailed imaging studies have revealed that
the spatial and temporal organisation of Ca 2+ signals
during embryogenesis are associated with many of the
major phases of development, from early cell division to
the differentiation of tissues. Despite their importance
little is known about the generation and regulation of
embryonic Ca2+ signals. A comprehensive understanding
of the pathways that regulate [Ca 2+ ] i during development is essential to understand the functional relevance
of these signals in the embryo.
Ryanodine receptors (RyR) are a family of intracellular
Ca 2+ release channels that regulate the entry of Ca 2+

into the cytosol from the intracellular organelles (the
endoplasmic and sarcoplasmic reticulum). The RyR is a
large homotetrameric protein (approximately 2,200
kDa), each subunit is comprised of a large N-terminal
cytoplasmic domain which modulates the gating of the
channel, as well as luminal and transmembrane spanning (TM) domains. In mammals, there are three distinct ryr genes (ryr1, ryr2 and ryr3) that encode three
differentially expressed RyR proteins. RyR1 and RyR2
are expressed predominantly in skeletal and cardiac
muscle respectively, whilst RyR3 is found in many tissues at relatively low levels [1]. The primary role of the
RyR is to increase [Ca2+]i during excitation-contraction
coupling (E-C coupling) in both skeletal and cardiac
muscle. In humans, mutations in the ryr1 and ryr2
genes cause skeletal myopathies and cardiac disease
respectively [2]. The generation of mouse knockout lines
has provided some insight into the role of the receptors
in the developing tissues of intact animals. Homozygous

mice from ryr1(−/−) (skrrm1) and ryr2(−/−) knockout lines
display gross morphological defects in either the skeletal
muscle (ryr1) or heart tube (ryr2) and die at the perinatal or embryonic day 10 (E10) stages respectively [3,4].
In contrast, ryr3(−/−) knockout mice appear to have no
gross developmental defects and evidence suggests that
RyR3 act to augment the [Ca2+]i response of the other
RyR isoforms in striated muscle [5,6]. The observation
that RyR expression does not occur until relatively late
in mammalian development [7], coupled with the fact
that knock out lines are not lethal at very early stages
has been interpreted as indicating that RyRs do not
function during initial development.
The zebrafish has been used extensively as a model
for vertebrate development. The rapid development ex
utero and embryonic transparency has proved advantageous for imaging the spatial and temporal organisation
of Ca2+ signals. These signals are involved in many of
the early embryonic events; the initiation of fertilisation
(0 hours post fertilisation, hpf), the early cell divisions
associated with the cleavage period (up to 2 hpf) and
the more extensive cellular rearrangements that occur
in the blastula period (up to 5 hpf) (as reviewed in [8]).
Evidence suggests that the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores via the phosphatidylinositol (PI) signalling
pathway is largely responsible for these early transient
changes in [Ca2+]i [9]. RyRs have not been implicated in
very early developmental events and their expression
during these stages has not been documented. Fluxes in
the levels of embryonic [Ca 2+ ] i continue to occur
throughout gastrulation (up to 10 hpf) (as reviewed in
[8]). Initially changes in [Ca2+]i occur as localised events
but, as gastrulation progresses, co-ordinated waves of
Ca2+ signalling appear across the embryo. These later
signals are proposed to coordinate a wide range of cellular movements (epiboly, involution, convergence and
extension) that give rise to the embryonic body plan.
Release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores via the PI signalling pathway is again implicated at this stage; however, the contribution to gastrulation from other Ca2+
signalling pathways remains undefined. Finally, the segmentation period (from 10 up to 24 hpf) is characterised by organogenesis and the emergence of the body
systems. The Ca2+ signals that occur during segmentation are again more localised and typically associated
with developing tissues. Transient changes in [Ca 2+ ] i
have been recorded within the nervous system, somites
and cardiac tissue [10-12]. Several studies in zebrafish
have shown that inhibition of ryanodine receptor function, using both pharmacological and genetic inhibitors,
leads to impaired excitation-contraction coupling and
gross morphological defects in the skeletal muscle, suggestive of a role in the development of this tissue
[11,13,14].

This study set out to acquire a more comprehensive
understanding of ryanodine receptor expression in early
vertebrate development, using the zebrafish as an in vivo
model. Our initial work confirmed the sequence of the
five zebrafish ryr genes, established their evolutionary
relationship to those in other vertebrate species and
provided a direct comparison between the structural features of the primary protein sequences found in the zebrafish and mammals. An overview of ryr gene expression
during zebrafish embryogenesis will inform work aimed
at establishing the developmental significance of this
family of Ca2+-release channels. Therefore we conducted
a comprehensive temporal and spatial analysis of ryr
mRNA expression in the embryo using a combination
of semi-quantitative PCR and wholemount in situ hybridisation. We observed strong maternal expression of ryr
mRNA (ryr3 and ryr2a) during the cleavage and blastula
periods suggestive of a novel role in early development.
At 24 hours post fertilisation (hpf) ryr1a, ryr1b and ryr3
are expressed in skeletal muscle, whereas ryr2a is localized to the central nervous system (CNS) and ryr2b is
found exclusively in the cardiac muscle. Our study suggests that RyR channels have a role in early development prior to organogenesis as well as in the
differentiation of different cell types.

Methods
Animal procedures

Wildtype (WT) zebrafish strains (Tubingen and Tupfel
long fin) were bred and raised in-house at the zebrafish
facility of Queen Mary College, University of London,
UK, as described previously [15]. Smoothened (smo)
mutants were received as a gift from Prof. Simon
Hughes (King’s College London, UK). Embryos were
collected by natural spawning and staged according to
Kimmel and colleagues [16], given in the text as standard developmental time at 28.5°C (hours post fertilisation, hpf). Work on zebrafish embryos (prior to
independent feeding) is exempt under the U.K. Animals
(Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and does not require
ethical approval.
Genomic analysis and gene prediction of ryr genes

To identify zebrafish ryr genes encoding RyRs as
described in Hirata and colleagues [13], protein
sequences corresponding to the human RyR family
[http://www.ensembl.org/Homosapiens/familyview?family=ENSF00000000736] were used as template for searching in GenBank and the zebrafish genome resources at
Ensembl http://www.ensembl.org/Danio_rerio/; Zv7
Ensembl assembly using a protein tBLASTn approach.
Several hits were identified, which were then compared
to the 3’-UTR sequence of the EST to identify the corresponding genomic region. The gene predictions

program, Genwise (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Wise2/) was
applied to reveal genomic contigs and full sequence
relating to the ryr1a, ryr2a, ryr2b and ryr3 in zebrafish
(Table 1). For ryr1a and ryr3, based on the tBLASTn
result, the Accession numbers (Table 2) and annotated
gene sequences for these isoforms were selected. For
ryr2a, owing to the limitations to the resources available
on the database, 5 contigs (NA_1034, NA_1216,
NA_3083, NA_1397 and NA_1713) were identified with
nucleotide similarity to the human ryr2, based on the
approach described above. Bioinformatics database
search approaches using human ryr2 did not reveal any
fully annotated ryr2b gene sequences in zebrafish. However, database blast results located a gene (EntrezGene
Name LOC568506 on chromosome 17:18.7 m) encoding
805 residues. The partial ryr2b gene located in a 19.98
kb region in the Ensembl Zv7 assembly shared very limited conserved symmetry with the human ryr2. An
alignment approach revealed that the zebrafish ryr2b
gene was reverse transcribed and the region of 19.98 kb
encoding 805 residues at the C-terminus end shows
high peptide identity to the human RyR2 C-terminus.
To help to find the missing large N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the RyR2b peptide, Genscan features on
Ensembl Zv7 assembly were employed to reveal an extra
1014 residues, giving a total of 1819 residues from the
C-terminal end of the peptide. In order to search further
for the missing portion of the RyR2 peptide towards the
N-terminus, a genomic region of 107,783 bp spanning
the C-terminal end of ryr2b gene to the start of neighbouring actn2 gene [Ensembl: ENSDARG00000071090],
was reverse complemented using REQSEV program
http://bioweb.pasteur.fr/seqanal/interfaces/revseq.html
before performing a pairwise BLAST alignment with
Gasterosteus aculeatus (stickleback) RyR2 peptide
sequence on NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/
bl2seq/wblast2.cgi) to confirm its sequence identity.
Based on the alignment result, the full length zebrafish
RyR2b peptide was first constructed with reference to
Takifugu rubripes (pufferfish) and stickleback RyR2 peptide sequences using the Genewise program (http://

www.ebi.ac.uk/Wise2/). The complete RyR2b peptide
was finalised by the alignment of the translated genomic
region using SHOWORF program http://bioweb.pasteur.
fr/seqanal/interfaces/showorf.html. The sequence for the
ryr2b gene was deposited in EMBL Nucleotide Sequence
Database (Accession no. FR822741). For ryr1b, sequence
was obtained via the NCBI CoreNucleotide search website [NCBI - AB247454] and isoform-specific PCR primers (set 3) were used, as described previously [13].
Isoform-specific PCR primers for ryr1a, ryr2a, ryr2b and
ryr3 were designed by retrieving the nucleotide
sequences based on divergent regions of the RyRs identified from peptide sequence (Figure 1). These regions
were re-confirmed by both BLAST against different
databases (NCBI nucleotide blast, Ensembl and ZFIN)
and DNA sequencing.
Phylogenetic Analysis

Protein sequences equivalent to the RIH_assoc
(pfam08454) and RR_TM4-6 (pfam06459) domains in
the five zebrafish RyR protein sequences (RyR1a, RyR1b,
partial RyR2a, RyR2b and RyR3) and other well characterised vertebrates RyR homologue sequences were
extracted from Ensembl and GenBank databases (Table
2). The RyR sequences were pre-aligned using the ClustalW alignment program to remove any gaps generated
within the sequences, followed by a multiple RyR
sequence alignment using the T-coffee program available from the European Bioinformatics Institute webpage (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/t-coffee/index.html)
with the default parameters. The output from the multiple sequence alignment result obtained from T-coffee
was used subsequently as the template for the generation of a Guide Tree using the equal angle method
available on the SplitsTree4 program with its default
parameters (http://www.splitstree.org/for free download).
Semi-quantitative end-point PCR

Total RNA was isolated from nine stages of zebrafish
development: 4- to 128-cell stage (1-2.25 hpf), 50%-epiboly stage (5.3 hpf), 100%-epiboly stage (10 hpf), 3- to

was subjected to 30 minutes treatment with DNase I
(Promega) at 37°C prior to cDNA synthesis performed
using a Cloned AMV First-Strand cDNA Synthesis kit
(Invitrogen) with random hexamers. For semi-quantitative end-point PCR, 1.5 μg of cDNA templates made

templates (pGEM-T Easy-ryrs) were linearised with an
appropriate restriction enzyme and then subjected to
phenol/chloroform purification and alcohol precipitation. Purified, linear DNA (0.5 μg) was used for the in
vitro transcription reaction (a 20 μl reaction contained
1X Transcription Buffer (Invitrogen), 2 μl DTT (0.1 M),
2 μl nucleotide mix (1 mM GTP, 1 mM ATP, 1 mM
CTP, 0.65 mM UTP and 0.35 mM DIG-11-UTP), 50U
placental ribonuclease inhibitor and 10U of RNA polymerase). The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 4 hours
before the removal of the original DNA template by
incubating with 2U of DNase at 37°C for 1 hour. DIGlabelled cardiac myosin light chain 2 (cmlc2;[18]), myogenic differentiation (myoD;[19]), nkx2.5 ([20]) and
fluorescein-11-UTP labelled myosin heavy chain 1
(myhz1;[21]) anti-sense probes were also prepared under
the same approach and used as positive markers.
Zebrafish embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
(PFA)/phosphate buffered Triton X100 (PBT) at 4°C
overnight or at room temperature (RT) for 2 hours,
then washed in 100% methanol and incubated at −20°C
for at least 30 minutes. Embryos were rehydrated in a
methanol gradient and treated with 10 μg/ml of Proteinase K/PBT for 1 to 20 minutes at RT depending on
their stages prior to fixation in 4% PFA/PBT for 20 minutes at RT (embryos before or at 50% epiboly stage were
not treated with Protease K or re-fixed). Embryos were
washed with PBT and pre-hybridised in hybridisation
mix (50% formamide, 5X SSC (0.75 M NaCl and 75
mM triNa citrate) at pH 5.0, 500 μg/ml yeast RNA, 50
μg/ml heparin, 0.1% Tween20) for 2 hours at 65°C. The
mixture was replaced by fresh hybridisation mix containing DIG-labelled or Fluorescein-labelled RNA probe
at the appropriate dilution and incubated at 65°C overnight. The post hybridisation washes were carried out at
65°C. The excess probe was removed by sequential
washing in 25% formamide in 2X SSC, 2X SSC, 0.2X
SSC at 65°C and finally in PBT at RT. Embryos were
incubated in maleic acid buffer (0.1 M Maleic acid pH

7.5 and 0.15 M NaCl) containing 2% Blocking Reagent
(Roche; MAB) at RT for a minimum of 1 hour. Staining
was carried out by replacing the MAB solution with the
1:5000 MAB diluted alkaline phosphatise (AP) conjugated anti-DIG antibody (Roche) or 1:4000 MAB diluted
AP conjugated anti-Fluorescein antibody (Roche) at 4°C
overnight. The embryos were washed with PBT and
then detection buffer (0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 9.5, 0.1 M
NaCl and 50 mM MgCl 2 and 0.1% Tween20) at RT.
The AP substrates used for colour development were
BM purple (Roche), Fast Red tablets (Roche) and NBT/
BCIP (Roche). The colour reaction was terminated by
washing in PBT and embryos were re-fixed in 4% PFA/
PBT for 2 hours at RT.
Immunocytochemistry

Wholemount immunocytochemistry (WICC) was conducted as described previously [22]. Briefly, embryos
were fixed overnight at 4°C and all subsequent steps
were performed at RT. Embryos were incubated in
blocking buffer prior to incubation in primary antibody
in 1% goat serum in phosphate buffered saline supplemented with 0.8% triton X100 (PBST) at room temperature. The primary antibodies used were 34 C, F59 and
MF20 at dilutions of 1:250, 1:10 and 1:100, respectively.
Embryos were rinsed in phosphate buffer with 0.8% triton (PBT) and incubated in a 1:1000 dilution of goat
anti-mouse IgG Cy™-5 linked secondary antibody
(Amersham) made up in 1% goat serum in PBT overnight. Embryos were rinsed in PBT and stored in 50%
glycerol/50% PBS.
For the double immuno-labelling (WISH/WICC), the
WISH labelled embryo was initially developed using
reagents as described above, followed by antibody labelling using a 1:10 dilution of F59 and a 1:5000 dilution of
goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated secondary antibody (Merck) carried out as
described in the Zebrafish Book [23]. Colour development by HRP was activated by the addition of 0.01% v/v

DAB and 6% v/v H2O2. Reaction was terminated by the
addition of PBS and fixed overnight in 4% PFA at 4°C.
For double-fluorescent labelling, the WISH labelled
embryo was initially developed using Fast Red, followed
by antibody labelling as described above.
Embryos were mounted in 100% glycerol and for flat

removed. Brightfield and fluorescent single or Z-stack
images were collected using a X10, X20, X63 oil immersion or X100 water immersion objectives on a Zeiss
LSM 510 microscope and LSM Image Examiner software. LSM Image Browser (Version 4,2,0,121) software
was used for image post-processing such as preparing

Results
The relationship between ryanodine receptor genes in
zebrafish and those of other vertebrates

We conducted a tBLASTn search of the zebrafish genomic database (Zv7 Ensembl), using the protein

sequences for human RyR1, RyR2 and RyR3 as queries,
and detected four zebrafish RyRs homologues: ryr1a,
ryr1b, ryr2b and ryr3 (as summarised in Table 1). ryr2a
was identified from scaffold sequences by blasting the
human RyR2 sequence in the updated NCBI database.
Despite the fact that the sequence obtained from ryr2a
is not a completed version based on the available information in current databases, the five genomic contigs
(NA_1034, NA_1216, NA_3083, NA_1397 and
NA_1713) identified to date show high similarity to
other vertebrate RyR orthologues. Zebrafish ryr gene
sequences display significant homology to their respective human isoforms (Table 1).
The evolutionary relationship of vertebrate RyR genes,
including the five zebrafish sequences was examined
(Figure 2). Three major monophyletic clades were identified that correspond to RyR1, RyR2 and RyR3 subfamilies. We found that the zebrafish RyR1a, RyR1b, RyR2a,
RyR2b and RyR3 all clustered with their respective gene
families into the three monophyletic clades [24]. The
zebrafish RyR1a and RyR1b cluster to their respective
subgroups with those of the other teleost species, Gasterosteus aculeatus (stickleback), Oryzias latipes
(medaka) and Takifugu rubripes (pufferfish). We identified two ryr2 genes in zebrafish, which currently appears

Figure 2 Phylogenetic tree of the vertebrate RyR gene family. The evolutionary relationship between the zebrafish ryr orthologues and
cloned full-length ryr genes of other vertebrate species was determined. RyR protein sequences were aligned using the T-coffee multiple
sequence alignment. The phylogenetic tree was generated using the equal angled method available on the SplitTree4 software. The branch
length of the tree is proportional to evolutionary distance. The family of human inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3R) was used as an outgroup. Three monophyletic clades corresponding to (1) RyR1, (2) RyR2 and (3) RyR3 gene subfamilies were identified. A full description of the
sequences used can be found in Table 2. through to adulthood.

to be the only species in which this gene duplication
event can be observed. The zebrafish ryr2a gene appears
to be more closely related to other teleosts (i.e. stickleback and pufferfish) whereas ryr2b gene is more
diverged. Although most teleosts appear to have two
ryr3 genes, we confirmed previous studies which report
a single zebrafish ryr3 gene [11,13,24].
Zebrafish RyRs contain many of the conserved structural
domains with similarities to other vertebrates

The molecular structure of the RyR protein has been
explored extensively, partly in the drive to understand
its regulation. Each monomeric RyR protein is approximately 5,000 amino acids in length with a molecular
mass of 565 kDa. The receptor has a large N-terminal
cytoplasmic domain containing many regulatory binding
sites (as reviewed in [25,26]) that modulate the gating of
the channel pore located in the C-terminus. The N-terminus cytoplamic domain of RyR interacts with a host
of regulatory proteins, such as calstabin and calmodulin.
Physiological modulators of RyR function include ATP,
Ca2+, Mg2+, cyclic ADP ribose, posttranslational modifications (e.g. phosphorylation, oxidation) and pharmacological substances (e.g. ryanodine, caffeine) [27].
We conducted an analysis to explore whether the zebrafish RyR protein sequences contain characterised conserved domains that may contribute to receptor
regulation and their comparison to their human counterparts was analysed (Figure 1a). MIR (Mannosyltransferase, Inositol 1,4,5-trisphophate receptor (IP 3R) and
RyR [pfam02815]) and RIH (RyR and IP3 R Homology
[pfam01365]) domains were identified within the Nterminal of all five zebrafish RyRs. The MIR and RIH
domains are common to all the members of the intracellular Ca2+-release channel super family [28,29]. The
MIR domain has been suggested to have a ligand transferase function and the RIH domain may form a binding
site for IP3; however, very little is known regarding their
role in receptor regulation to date [29]. All of the zebrafish RyRs contain three SPRY domains (SPla and the
RyR [pfam00622]), which have been proposed to interact
with voltage gated channels [30,31]. Each zebrafish RyR
also contains four copies of the RyR domains (RyR
repeated domain [pfam02026]), a sequence unique to
these channels [29]. Furthermore, zebrafish RyRs contain the eukaryotic RIH associated (RyR and IP 3 R
Homology associated [pfam08454]) domain, which currently has no known function. EF-hand motifs may have
a functional significance in activation of the channel by
Ca2+ themselves. Putative Ca2+ binding sequences, EF1
and EF2 [32], have been identified in the receptor and
are thought to be the major Ca2+ regulatory sites. We
identified similar putative EF-hand motifs towards the
C-terminal of the receptor and these appear to be

Page 8 of 17

conserved in all zebrafish and human isoforms. The RyR
pore determines the conductance and ion selectivity of
the channel; however, the structure of the TM and pore
forming region is still unresolved. There are eight proposed TM sequences, of which the last six are suggested
to form the Ca2+ release channel [33]. According to the
topological model by Du and colleagues six to eight TM
sequences (i.e. M4a/M4b, M5, M6, M7a/M7b, M8 and
M10) were identified, with the M9 (pore segment)
inserted between the M8 and M10 TM segments. This
M9 region is proposed to act as the selectivity filter
allowing Ca2+ to transverse the membrane [34]. All five
zebrafish RyRs contain RR TM 4-6 domains (RyR TM
4-6 [pfam06459]). Comparison of sequence in the core
pore-forming region demonstrate that all five zebrafish
RyR sequences are highly conserved with other vertebrate species, although it should be noted that there are
subtle changes at the single amino acid level (Figure 1b).
Zebrafish ryr mRNA expression can be detected from the
earliest stages of development through to adulthood

We examined the temporal expression of the ryr genes
during nine key stages of zebrafish development using
semi-quantitative end-point PCR (Figure 3a). Expression
of ryr1a was detected from 11-12 hpf (3- to 6-somite
stage) through to adulthood, whereas ryr1b expression
was evident from 18 hpf (18-somite stage) onwards.
Results also showed that levels of mRNA expression for
both ryr1a and ryr1b were at the highest in 144 hpf and
adult stages. The ryr2a gene showed strong maternal
expression at 1-2 hpf (4- to 128-cell stage) and zygotic
expression was observed from 18 hpf through to adulthood. Expression of ryr2b mRNA was detected from 18
hpf through to adulthood with relatively weak expression observed at 24 hpf and 144 hpf stages. Finally, ryr3
maternal expression was observed at 1-2 hpf, followed
by weak zygotic mRNA expression from 5.3 hpf (50%
epiboly stage) through to 18 hpf (18-somite stage), after
which the levels became much stronger ryr1a, ryr1b
and ryr3 are expressed exclusively in skeletal muscle
during segmentation period
We examined the spatial and temporal distribution
pattern of the zebrafish ryr mRNA in the developing
embryo from 12 to 24 hpf of development using WISH.
The expression of ryr1a, ryr1b and ryr3 in the developing somites was compared to the myogenic determinant
(myoD), one of the earliest markers of myogenic commitment with a key role in regulating muscle differentiation (Figure 4a) [19].
We observed low levels of ryr1a expression in the
adaxial cells located on either side of the notochord
beginning at 11 hpf (Figure 4a). Our findings demonstrate that in slow muscle ryr1a appears at 11 hpf, 1 to
2 hpf prior to fast muscle ryr1b mRNA expression.

as indicated, and reverse transcribed. 1.5 μg of cDNA was synthesised and isoform specific primers for ryr1a, ryr1b, ryr2a, ryr2b and ryr3 used.
Numbers in the right panel indicate the molecular mass of PCR products. b-actin was used as an internal control. The figure shows a

After the lateral migration of the slow muscle precursors
is completed, the expression of ryr1a mRNA is clearly
visible in the superficial layer of slow muscle (Figure
4b). There is conflicting evidence that by 24 hpf ryr1a
mRNA is confined either to slow muscle fibres [13], or
can be detected at low levels throughout the somite[14].
In this study we found that ryr1a mRNA co-localises
with a known marker of slow muscle fibres at 24 hpf

(Figure 4b). Furthermore, ryr1a mRNA staining was not
detected in the somites of smoothened (smo−/−)
embryos, a mutant line which lacks slow muscle and the
muscle pioneers (Figure 4c). Thus, we conclude that
ryr1a mRNA is expressed exclusively in embryonic slow
muscle.
We observed low levels of ryr1b expression in adaxial
cells adjacent to the notochord beginning at 12-13 hpf

and ryr3 was examined using whole mount in situ hybridisation. Expression of ryr1a mRNA is detectable in the adaxial cells of 11 hpf embryos

(Figure 4a). At 18 and 24 hpf, strong ryr1b expression
was detected throughout the somites in a pattern analogous to that of myoD, suggestive of its presence in both
fast and slow muscle. Currently there is conflicting
reports suggesting that ryr1b expression is confined
either to the fast muscle [13] or appears in both fast
and slow muscle [35]. In the later study the observation
that ryr1b mRNA expression is found in both muscle
types was attributed to an artefact arising as a consequence of contaminated tissue [35]. In order to clarify
our findings we performed double-fluorescent labeling
experiments, to observe ryr1b expression in the presence
of a slow muscle marker. In contrast to previous work
which used a ryr1b in situ probe that targeted the relatively conserved pore forming region at the C-terminus
we generated a probe that recognised a more variable
region at the N-terminus of the receptor [13]. Our data
revealed that ryr1b mRNA is localised to both fast and
slow developing skeletal muscle (Figure 4b, Additional
file 1: Figure S1).
Maternal expression of ryr3 in the dividing cells of 2
to 2.25 hpf (64- and 128-cell) embryos was confirmed
by wholemount in situ hybridisation (WISH) (Figure
3b); however, the low level expression of ryr3 from 5.3
to 18 hpf detected in the PCR analysis was not confirmed by WISH (data not shown). In this study ryr3
mRNA expression was detected in the skeletal muscle
from 24 hpf using WISH (Figure 4a,b), with stronger
expression in the anterior compared to developing posterior somites (Figure 4a). There is conflicting evidence
that ryr3 mRNA in zebrafish is expressed exclusively in
slow and fast skeletal muscle from 14 hpf [11] or in
many tissues including the CNS during the somitogenesis [14,36]. The discrepancies in the expression patterns
of ryr3 mRNA may be explained in part by the target
sequence used for probe synthesis in previous studies.
The ryr3 clone (019-D04-2) used previously targeted the
conserved pore-forming region at the C-terminus of the
receptor which shares high similarity to both the ryr1a
and ryr1b sequence, this raises the possibility that cross
hybridisation with ryr1 isoforms occurred [11]. In the
current work the ryr3 probe was designed to a more
divergent region located in the N-terminus of the receptor. In this study ryr3 mRNA expression was not
detected in the Kuppfer’s vesicles, adaxial cells at 12 hpf
or in any region of the CNS at 24 hpf (data not shown).
Double staining experiments revealed that ryr3 mRNA
expression was confined to the fast skeletal muscle at 24
hpf (Figure 4b, Additional file 1: Figures S1 and Additional file 2: Figure S2). Thus we conclude that ryr3
mRNA is expressed exclusively in the fast skeletal muscle of embryos at 24 hpf.

ryr2a and ryr2b are expressed in the developing zebrafish
CNS and heart, respectively

Expression of ryr2a mRNA was detected initially in the
CNS of zebrafish embryos starting at 24 hpf (Figure 5a).
At 24 and 48 hpf, ryr2a mRNA expression can be
observed at several sites in the developing forebrain (telencephalon and diencephalon), midbrain (mesencephalon) and hindbrain (rhombencephalon) of the zebrafish
embryo (Figure 5a). A lateral view shows ryr2a mRNA
expression in all seven hindbrain rhombomeres, r1-r7 by
48 hpf (Figure 5b). The dorsal view clearly revealed two
bilateral patches of ryr2a expression lying dorsal to the
eyes which may correspond to the developing tegmental
region (Figure 5c). Low level staining was also observed
in the anterior portion of the spinal cord at 48 hpf (Figure 5a). Analysis of ryr2a expression by PCR showed
that 3 month old zebrafish display a strong ryr2b
mRNA expression in the brain compared to the body
(Figure 3b). However, the significant maternal expression of ryr2a mRNA detected by PCR (Figure 3a) was
not detected by WISH (data not shown). We conclude
that zygotic ryr2a expression is expressed exclusively in
the developing CNS of zebrafish embryos.
The expression of ryr2b was compared to two wellcharacterised cardiac markers, nkx2.5 and cmlc2
[18,20,37] (Figure 6). Expression of nkx2.5, a homeodomain transcription factor, is the earliest known marker
of zebrafish precardiac mesoderm [20,37]. Cardiac myosin light chain 2 (cmlc2), another marker of myocardial
precursor cells, is expressed throughout heart fusion
and early heart tube assembly [18]. We show that
nkx2.5 but not cmlc2 and ryr2b expression can be
observed in the heart progenitor cells at 11 hpf; however, by 14 hpf the bilateral expression of cmlc2 and
ryr2b was apparent in the precardiac mesoderm. As
reported previously [18], nkx2.5 expression extends
beyond the anterior tip of the notochord and the most
posterior nkx2.5 cells (nkx2.5 + ) do not express cmlc2
(cmlc2-). ryr2b expression appears to be expressed in the
region corresponding to cmlc2 + consistent with its
appearance in cells that will contribute to the myocardium. By 18 hpf the bilateral cardiac primordial cells
expressing cmlc2 and ryr2b bend towards each other,
make contact and begin to fuse (Figure 7a). The posterior portions fuse initially followed by anterior portions
to create a central lumen and cardiac cone by 20 hpf.
At 24 hpf, the heart has formed a linear tube with atrial
and ventricular precursor cells and ryr2b expression
appears to mirror that of cmlc2+cells, suggestive of its
expression throughout the heart at this stage. Using
WICC, we observed RyR protein in the atrium and ventricle of the zebrafish heart at 48 hpf (Figure 7b).

(b) Lateral and (c) dorsal views (eyes removed) of the brain at 48 hpf revealed that ryr2a expression was present in each of the seven
rhombomere segments, the tegmentum, trigeminal ganglia and anterior portion of the spinal cord. Embryos are orientated so that anterior is to
the left.

Discussion
Structure of the zebrafish ryr genes and their products:
comparison to other species

Previous work identified a total of 14 genomic contigs
for ryr from the zebrafish genome assembly [13]. Classification of RyR sequences by radiation hybrid mapping
suggested that there are at least five different zebrafish
genes: ryr1a, ryr1b, ryr2a, ryr2b and ryr3 [13]. Our
study has confirmed the sequences of the five zebrafish

ryr genes, although currently the ryr2a gene annotation
is still incomplete. Zebrafish, like other teleosts, have
undergone a gene duplication event and appear to have
retained two distinct copies of ryr1 and ryr2. The teleost
ryr1 genes are differentially expressed in the skeletal
muscle tissue and the receptors have distinctive Ca 2+
binding sensitivities, suggesting that the genes have
evolved to perform different physiological functions
[13,38]. Here we report that the zebrafish genome

Figure 6 Zebrafish ryr2b is expressed in the differentiating cardiac muscle. Expression of zebrafish nkx2.5, cmlc2, and ryr2b was examined
using whole mount in situ hybridisation. Expression of nkx2.5 was observed in myocardial precursors from 11 hpf (3-somite stage) onwards,
whereas cmlc2 and ryr2b were expressed in differentiating cardiac tissue from 14 hpf (10-somite stage) onwards. 11, 12 and 14 hpf embryos are
orientated so that the anterior is to the top, whereas in 18, 24 and 48 hpf embryos anterior is to the left.

contains two copies of the ryr2 gene, currently the only
teleost in which this gene duplication can be observed.
Our study has revealed that expression of ryr2a and
ryr2b is confined to the embryonic nervous and cardiac

tissue respectively. The differential expression of the
ryr2 supports the idea that the gene products have different roles within these tissues. The reported sub-functionalisation of the ryr2 in the zebrafish embryo in this

bilateral cardiac primordial cells make contact and begin to fuse (arrows). The posterior portions fuse initially followed by anterior portions to
create a central lumen and cardiac cone by 20 hpf (22-somite stage). A linear heart tube has formed by 24 hpf and ryr2b and cmlc2+ cells are
expressed throughout the heart at this stage. 18- and 22-somite stage embryos, in which the tail was removed but the yolk sac left intact, were

chambers, atrium (A) and ventricle (V) of the heart. Images were taken using X10 (b,c & e,f) and X20 (d & g) objectives.

study will facilitate the study of this receptor in the
development of nervous and cardiac tissue.
Our work has revealed that the primary sequence of
the zebrafish RyRs contains many of the conserved
domains associated with the regulation and function of
this intracellular ion channel in other species, mostly
notably humans. The primary sequence of the Ca2+-conducting pore domain was found to be extensively conserved between zebrafish and other species examined.
Our study of RyR primary structure supports previous
work to show that the biophysical properties and pharmacological regulation of the zebrafish RyR1 is similar
to its mammalian homolog [39]. Taken together this
data reveals that the zebrafish RyR functions in a similar
manner to those found in mammals, this information is
of significant relevance to work using the zebrafish as a
model for human disease. However, differences in the
predicted primary sequence of the zebrafish ryanodine
receptor proteins and those of other species were also
recorded. There are reports species-specific differences
in the Ca2+ regulation and single channel conductance
of the RyR1 channel [39]. Further comparative analysis
of the RyR family will provide a better insight into the
physiological functions of the receptor at a tissue or
whole organism level.
The expression of ryr genes during early development,
up to and including axis formation

Calcium signalling is required throughout development;
however the signal pathways have not been well defined.
The prevailing view is that IP 3 R-driven Ca 2+ signals
have a major role in axis formation prior to organogenesis whereas RyR-induced Ca2+ signals are necessary for
the later aspects of tissue specific differentiation (e.g.
muscle formation) [3-5,7,9,40]. Our current study
revealed strong maternal expression of ryr2b and ryr3
genes during cleavage, with low levels of ryr3 expression
detectable throughout the blastula and gastrula periods.
The significance of early ryr mRNA expression remains
to be determined; however, it raises the possibility that
RyR-generated Ca2+ signals act in development prior to
10 hpf. The characterisation of expression in zebrafish
establishes a basis for future experimental work aimed
at determining the action of RyR-induced Ca2+ signalling events in early embryonic patterning.
The expression of ryr genes in developing skeletal muscle

Several studies have implicated RyR function in organogenesis, particularly in striated muscle development (as
reviewed in [9]). Our study has used both mutant lines
and double staining to establish that RyRs are differentially expressed in slow (ryr1a), fast (ryr3) and both types
(ryr1b) of developing skeletal muscle during the segmentation period. In E-C coupling within mammalian skeletal

Page 15 of 17

muscle, RyR1 is directly coupled to a voltage gated-Ca2+
channel (VOC) on the sarcolemma. Activation of VOCs
via membrane depolarisation then triggers the opening of
the ryanodine receptor (RyR1) and release of Ca2+ from
the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) stores. Zebrafish have
non-Ca 2+ -conducting voltage-gated Ca channels that
have evolved solely as voltage sensors to trigger opening
of the RyR [35]. The central subunit of the VOC
(Cav1.1a1s) acts as the pore, selectivity filter and voltage
sensor. In zebrafish two Cav1.1a1s genes (zf-a1s-a and zfa1s-b) have been identified. The Cav1.1a1s gene products
are proposed to interact in a tissue specific manner with
the ryr1 genes; that is zf-a1s-a and ryr1a are expressed in
slow muscle whilst zf-a1s-b and ryr1b are confined to
fast muscle. However, our data suggest that the situation
is not quite as clear cut as first proposed because ryr1b is
not expressed exclusively in fast muscle but is also
located in slow muscle. In addition, Ca2+ release can also
be regulated by the ryr3 gene product which is also
located in the fast skeletal muscle. RyR3 is proposed to
act as an uncoupled calcium-induced calcium release
(CICR) channel to propagate the Ca2+ signal [41]. Therefore we propose that in the developing fast muscle zfa1s-b and ryr1b act together to generate an increase in
[Ca2+]i, with the ryr3 gene product acting to amplify the
signal. Our data in the embryonic fast muscle showed
that ryr1b expression occurs prior to ryr3 and suggests
that the RyR-generated [Ca2+]i increase occurs initially
via ryr1b with the proposed amplification step via ryr3
developing subsequently. In zebrafish the role of the RyR
in E-C coupling within the developing slow muscle
appears more complex. Our data reveals that both ryr1a
and ryr1b are expressed in the developing slow muscle,
but ryr3 is not. This presents the possibility that zf-a1s-a
could couple to both ryr1a and ryr1b and raises the issue
of whether amplification of the Ca2+ signals occurs in
this tissue and, if so, how is this achieved. Clearly there is
still much to understand about the maturation of depolarization-induced Ca2+ signaling and its role during skeletal muscle differentiation in vivo.
The expression of ryr genes in the developing nervous
and cardiovascular systems

Our data has revealed that there are two ryr2 genes,
ryr2a and ryr2b, which are exclusively expressed in
either the developing nervous system or cardiac tissue,
respectively. Studies in mammals revealed that RyR are
expressed in the developing brain and that RyRmediated Ca2+ signals may have a role in neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth [42-44]. All three ryr
genes are expressed within the embryonic mouse brain;
however, from postnatal day 7 onwards ryr2 becomes in
the major isoform [45]. The postnatal changes in RyR
expression in mouse brain correlate with a period of

Wu et al. BMC Research Notes 2011, 4:541
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/4/541

neuronal differentiation and may therefore be important
in establishing [Ca2+]i homeostasis in maturing neurons.
In zebrafish ryr2a expression is localized to specific
regions of the developing brains. In these regions ryr2a
is likely to regulate neuronal Ca2+ signaling and therefore play a role in CNS development.
In mature cardiac muscle, Ca2+ signals are generated
by CICR via the activation of VOCs and the cardiac RyR
(RyR2). Knockout mice which do not express ryr2 initially display spontaneous rhythmic contractions of the
heart at embryonic day 9 (E9) but no heart beat by day
10 (E10) [4]. Furthermore, RyR-mediated Ca2+ release
does not play a significant role in the [Ca2+]i changes
observed within the heart of new born rats [46]. Thus in
mammals it appears that the RyR2 does not contribute
to the onset of contractile activity at very early embryonic stages, but is important for the subsequent maturation and development of the heart in vivo. The zebrafish
cardiac ryr gene (ryr2b) is expressed exclusively in the
developing heart tissue (precardiac mesoderm) from 14
hpf, 8 hours prior to the onset of cardiac contraction at
22 hpf, and may well contribute to early cardiac development. Investigation of ryr2 function during mammalian development is complicated by the fact that a single
ryr2 gene is expressed in several tissues [1]. The subfunctionalisation of the ryr2a and ryr2b genes in the
zebrafish embryo provides an excellent system to study
individual receptor function in neuronal and cardiac tissues during vertebrate development.

Conclusions
This study has provided a comprehensive overview of
the spatial and temporal expression of the ryr gene
family in developing zebrafish embryos. This family of
Ca2+-release channels are expressed predominantly in
developing skeletal, cardiac and neuronal tissue, supportive of the view that RyRs function is relevant to later
development events, such as tissue differentiation. In
addition, the study has also revealed that maternal ryr
mRNA is present in the very early embryo, suggestive of
a function for this receptor prior to organogenesis. Ryanodine receptors have been implicated in human disease
and the zebrafish is an important vertebrate developmental model which will facilitate work in this area.
Future work will explore the function of RyR-regulated
Ca2+ signal pathways during zebrafish embryogenesis.
Additional material
Additional file 1: Figure S1. ryr1a, ryr1b and ryr3 mRNA is
differentially expressed in the developing skeletal muscle. Double
labelling in wholemount embryos at 24 hpf was performed using probes
to myhz1, ryr1a, ryr1b and ryr3 and Fast Red as a substrate (red) followed
by immunostaining using the F59 antibody and a fluorescent secondary
(green). Images show Z-stacks of whole-mount double-labelled embryos

(top row) or sections (bottom row) from dissected embryos. Crosssectional images revealed that ryr1a co-localised exclusively with slow
muscle staining, whereas myhz1, a marker of fast muscle, was not
expressed in the slow muscle. Furthermore ryr1b expression could be
observed throughout both muscle types whereas ryr3 did not co-localise
with the slow muscle staining and appeared to be expressed exclusively
in the fast muscle. Scale bars = 20 μm, unless otherwise indicated.
Additional file 2: Figure S2. ryr3 mRNA expression is confined to the
fast muscle fibres throughout the myotome at 24 hpf. Double
fluorescent cross-sections (1-3) were prepared by labelling a 24 hpf
zebrafish embryo with a fluorescence substrate (i.e. FastRed; red) for ryr3
in situ hybridisation and the F59 antibody (green) for immunostaining.
The position of cross-sections 1-3 are illustrated in the 24 hpf ryr3 WISH
labelled embryo (top left) which has been stained with BM purple and
laterally orientated with anterior to the left. Scale bars = 20 μm, unless
otherwise indicated.
