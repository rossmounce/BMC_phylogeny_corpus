Abstract
Background: Protein kinases are key enzymes that regulate a wide range of cellular processes,
including cell-cycle progression, transcription, DNA replication and metabolic functions. These
enzymes catalyse the transfer of phosphates to serine, threonine and tyrosine residues, thus playing
functional roles in reversible protein phosphorylation. There are two main groups, namely
eukaryotic protein kinases (ePKs) and atypical protein kinases (aPKs); RIO kinases belong to the
latter group. While there is some information about RIO kinases and their roles in animals, nothing
is known about them in parasites. This is the first study to characterise a RIO1 kinase from any
parasite.
Results: A full-length cDNA (Tv-rio-1) encoding a RIO1 protein kinase (Tv-RIO1) was isolated from
the economically important parasitic nematode Trichostrongylus vitrinus (Order Strongylida). The
uninterrupted open reading frame (ORF) of 1476 nucleotides encoded a protein of 491 amino
acids, containing the characteristic RIO1 motif LVHADLSEYNTL. Tv-rio-1 was transcribed at the
highest level in the third-stage larva (L3), and a higher level in adult females than in males.
Comparison with homologues from other organisms showed that protein Tv-RIO1 had significant
homology to related proteins from a range of metazoans and plants. Amino acid sequence identity
was most pronounced in the ATP-binding motif, active site and metal binding loop. Phylogenetic
analyses of selected amino acid sequence data revealed Tv-RIO1 to be most closely related to the
proteins in the species of Caenorhabditis. A structural model of Tv-RIO1 was constructed and
compared with the published crystal structure of RIO1 of Archaeoglobus fulgidus (Af-Rio1).
Conclusion: This study provides the first insights into the RIO1 protein kinases of nematodes, and
a foundation for further investigations into the biochemical and functional roles of this molecule in
biological processes in parasitic nematodes.

Background
Protein kinases are a group of enzymes essential for the
regulation of a large variety of cellular processes, includ-

ing cell-cycle progression, transcription, DNA replication
and metabolic functions [1]. These enzymes catalyse the
transfer of phosphates to serine, threonine and tyrosine

residues, thus playing functional roles in reversible protein phosphorylation. In organisms, such as Homo sapiens,
Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster (vinegar fly),
Caenorhabditis elegans (worm), Saccharomyces cerevisiae
(yeast), Dictyostelium discoideum (slime mould) and Plasmodium falciparum (malaria parasite), the complete complement of protein kinases has been identified via the
analysis of genome sequences [2]. Based on their structure, protein kinases can be classified into two main
groups, namely eukaryotic protein kinases (ePKs) and
atypical protein kinases (aPKs) [3]. The ePKs usually have
11 subdomains, including a nucleotide-binding loop
(subdomain I), typically with the sequence GXGXXG,
which binds and orients the phosphates of ATP; a hinge
region which interacts with the adenine moiety of the
ATP; a catalytic loop (subdomain VIb) which contains
conserved catalytic Asn and Asp residues involved in
phosphoryl transfer; a metal-binding or "DFG" loop (subdomain VII) for the positioning of metal ions; and an activation loop (subdomain VIII) [4]. The aPKs are enzymes
with protein kinase activity and limited sequence similarity to any known ePKs. Of the 518 kinases known to be
encoded in the human genome, 40 have been identified
as aPKs, which have been classified into 13 families or
groups, one of which represents the RIO kinases [3]. These
serine kinases are conserved in sequence among a range of
different organisms, yet are quite divergent from kinases
of other families with known structures [5,6].
Through sequence and structural analyses, RIO proteins
have been found to contain the conserved signature residues, typifying protein kinases [7,8]. RIO kinases are
present in organisms from archaea to humans, suggesting
key fundamental roles in the Metazoa. The function of
RIO1 was first investigated in yeast [9]. It was found that
RIO1 is a non-ribosomal protein located in the cytoplasm
and specifically required for 20S precursor ribosomal RNA
(pre-rRNA) processing; the depletion of the protein RIO1
caused the inhibition of 18S rRNA production and an
accumulation of the 20S pre-rRNA in the cytoplasm. Further sequence characterisation of RIO1 of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae indicated that this protein was a serine kinase
[8]. Although the primary sequences of RIO1 proteins are
quite divergent from those of members of other protein
kinase families, their structural folding is similar to
known canonical protein kinases. Also, they display protein kinase activity in vitro. Analysis by mutagenesis [8]
showed that some of the conserved residues are crucial for
enzymatic activity, and cytological study of RIO1 has
revealed that it also plays an important role in cell-cycle
progression (in G1 to S transition and in the control of the
onset of anaphase) as well as the maintenance of mitotic
chromosome stability [8]. In contrast to RIO1, RIO2
kinase appears to be localized predominantly to the
nucleus [10]. The biological activities of these two pro-

http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/1/1/34

teins neither complement each other nor do they copurify, although both are associated with the same fractions containing 20S precursor RNA in yeast [11].
Although not yet studied in detail in multicellular organisms, RIO1 kinases are encoded in the genome of the freeliving nematode Caenorhabditis elegans [12]. RNA interference (RNAi), which decreases messenger RNA (mRNA)
levels of the targeted C. elegans gene, has been shown to
affect predominantly embryonic and larval growth and/or
development [13-17]. In spite of the functional importance of this molecule, there is no published information
regarding its structure or function for any parasitic nematode. Clearly, the isolation and characterisation of RIO
protein kinases from nematodes would provide a starting
point for a better understanding of their roles in developmental processes. In a genomic study [18], we characterised an expressed sequence tag (EST), designated
TVf09_H06, from an adult female-enriched cDNA library
for Trichostrongylus vitrinus, an economically important
parasitic nematode. The amino acid sequence inferred
from this EST had the highest homology (e-value: 2e-37) to
the protein encoded by predicted RIO1 kinase
(M01B12.5; see http://www.wormbase.org/) from C. elegans (unpublished findings). Therefore, the aims of this
study were to isolate and characterise the full-length complementary DNA (cDNA) of RIO1 of T.vitrinus corresponding to TVf09_H06 and carry out comparative
analyses with related molecules encoded by other organisms, to explore transcription in different developmental
stages and to predict its three-dimensional structure by
comparison with known crystal structures of homologues.

Methods
Parasite propagation
Merino lambs (males; 8–12 weeks of age), maintained
under helminth-free conditions, were inoculated intraruminally with 30,000 infective third-stage larvae (L3) of
T. vitrinus. The patency of the infection (~24 days after
inoculation) was established by the detection of strongylid eggs in the faeces using the McMaster flotation
method [19]. First- and second-stage larvae (L1 and L2)
and L3 were collected after 1, 3 and 7 days of incubation
of faeces at 28°C, respectively, and purified by repeated
sedimentation and a migration through a nylon sieve
(mesh size: 20 μm) for 16 h. For the collection of fourthstage larvae (L4) and adults of T. vitrinus, infected lambs
were euthanized by intravenous administration of an
overdose of pentobarbitone sodium (Lethobarb, Virbac
Pty. Ltd.) 8 and 30 days after intra-ruminal inoculation,
respectively. Adult worms were collected (using fine forceps) from the chyme from the first 4 m of the small intestine, washed extensively in chilled (4°C) phosphatebuffered saline (PBS), and males and females (adults) sep-

arated prior to snap freezing in liquid nitrogen and subsequent storage at -70°C.
Isolation, purification, treatment and storage of nucleic
acids
Total genomic DNA was extracted from ~0.5 g of single
sex (male or female) adult worms using a small-scale
sodium dodecyl-sulphate (SDS)/proteinase K extraction
procedure [20], followed by mini-column (Wizard®
Clean-Up, Promega) purification. The specific identity of
the parasite material in each sample was confirmed by
PCR amplification of the second internal transcribed
spacer (ITS-2) of nuclear ribosomal DNA from genomic
DNA and subsequent, automated sequencing [20,21]. The
sequences determined were required to be identical to the
ITS-2 sequence with GenBank accession no. X78064[21].

Total RNA was extracted separately from different developmental stages (L1, L2, L3, L4 or adults) or sexes of T. vitrinus (homogenized under liquid nitrogen using a mortar
and pestle) employing the TriPure isolation reagent®
(Roche Molecular Biochemicals). RNA yields were estimated spectrophotometrically (ND-1000 UV-VIS spectrophotometer, v.3.2.1, NanoDrop Technologies), and the
integrity of RNA was confirmed via the detection of discrete 18S and 28S ribosomal RNA bands on ethidium bromide-stained gels. Each RNA sample (~10 μg) was treated
with 2 U of DNase I (Promega) and incubated at 37°C for
30 min prior to heat denaturation of the enzyme (75°C
for 5 min). Both DNA and RNA samples were stored at 70°C.
Isolation of the full-length cDNA encoding RIO1 kinase
from T. vitrinus
Using four gene-specific primers PK1F (forward: 5'CGACTTCTCCAGCGTGGAACGTTAACC-3');
PK2R
(reverse: 5'-GGAACCAGGGAGACCCGCTTGATGCT-3');
PK3F (forward: 5'-GAACCGGCTACTGCAAACACAACCCCCG-3');
PK4R
(reverse:
5'-GCGGTGCACCCCAGCCATCACGACC-3') designed to the sequence of
EST TVf09_H06 (accession no. NP_491102.2), two partially overlapping cDNA fragments were produced separately from total RNA from adult female worms using 5'and 3'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)
(SMART™ RACE cDNA Amplification Kit, BD Biosciences). The cDNAs were ligated separately into the
pGEM-T-Easy® vector (Promega); Escherichia coli (strain
JM109) (108 colony forming units/μg) was transformed
with recombinant plasmids via heat shock and then
grown overnight at 37°C on Luria Bertani (LB) plates containing 10 mg/ml ampicillin, 0.5 mM isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and 80 μg/ml X-gal (5-bromo4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-galactosidase). Plasmid DNA was
isolated from recombinant clones and column-purified
(Wizard®, Promega) from overnight cultures, and inserts

sequenced in both directions using vector oligonucleotide
primers (M13 and SP6), employing Big Dye Terminator
v.3.1 chemistry in an automated ABI-PRISM sequencer
(Applied Biosystems). Based on the resultant sequences,
selected oligonucleotide primers were designed to amplify
the full-length Tv-rio-1 cDNA from T. vitrinus adult
females, which was subsequently cloned and sequenced.
Bioinformatic analyses
Nucleotide sequences were assembled using the program
EGassembler [22]. The full-length cDNA sequence of Tvrio-1 was conceptually translated (six different frames)
into amino acid sequences using the Baylor College of
Medicine (BCM) Search Launcher [23] and aligned using
the program ClustalW [24]. Sequences were compared
with those available in public, non-redundant databases
using BLASTn and BLASTx algorithms [25] available via
the National Center for Biotechnology Information [26],
the Sanger Centre [27] and the Parasite Genome database
[28], in order to verify the identity of the molecules isolated. Protein motifs were identified by scanning the database PROSITE [29] and Pfam [30].

Phylogenetic analyses of inferred primary amino acid
sequence data were conducted using the program
PAUP*4.0b10 [31], as described previously [32]. In brief,
the neighbour-joining (NJ) method was used to construct
trees from distance data. The maximum parsimony (MP)
method, based on character state analysis, was also used.
Characters were treated as unordered and were weighted
equally; alignment gaps were treated as "missing" in all
analysis. Exhaustive searches with tree-bisection-reconnection (TBR) branch swapping were used to infer the
shortest trees. The length, consistency index, excluding
uninformative characters, and the retention indices of
each most parsimonious tree were recorded. Bootstrap
analyses (1000 replicates) were conducted using heuristic
searches and TBR branch swapping, with the MulTrees
option, to determine the relative support for clades in the
consensus trees.
The three-dimensional structure of the RIO1 kinase of
Archaeoglobus fulgidus (Af-RIO1 kinase; PDB code 1ZTF; cf.
[5,6]) was used to create an homology model of the RIO
domain of Tv-RIO1 using the program DeepView SwissPdbViewer and the SWISS-MODEL server [33]. The energy
of the resultant model was minimized in DeepView using
Gromos 96 [33]. The model did not include the C-terminal extension, characteristic of sequences of eukaryotic
RIO1 proteins, including Tv-RIO1.
All comparative analyses with C. elegans were carried out
using WormBase [34]. Genetic interactions with the C. elegans orthologue (gene name M01B12.5) of Tv-RIO1 were
predicted using the probabilistic functional gene network

for C. elegans (see [35]); this computational network covers the majority (82%) of C. elegans genes and makes predictions regarding essentiality, spanning diverse cellular
and developmental processes [35].
Reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction
(PCR)
Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized from total RNA
separately from each stage and sex of T. vitrinus using
reverse transcriptase (Superscript III, Invitrogen). Briefly,
5 μg of total RNA were added to 14 μl of H2O and 1 μl of
oligo d(T)n = 12–18 primer (0.5 μg/μl), heated to 70°C
for 10 min and chilled on ice. First- and second-strand
cDNAs were synthesized via the addition of 4 μl of firststrand cDNA buffer (250 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 375 mM
KCl and 15 mM MgCl2), 2 μl of 0.1 M dithiothreitol, and
1 μl of 10 mM of each dNTP, followed by an incubation
at 25°C for 10 min, 42°C for 50 min and 70°C for 15
min. The transcripts (176 bp) representing Tv-rio-1 were
amplified from individual cDNAs by real-time PCR using
the primer pair PK3F-PK4R. The PCR amplification of a
portion (187 bp) of the large subunit (28S) ribosomal
RNA using primers 28S1/F (5'-GCATTAGCTCTCGCGTTACC-3') and 28S3/R (5'-GAGAGGGACAGCAGGTTCAC-3'), previously determined to be present equally in
each developmental stage and sex in a related parasitic
nematode, Oesophagostomum dentatum (see [36]), was
used as a positive control. Samples without template (noDNA controls) were included in each PCR run. For each
sample, ~0.5 μg of cDNA was subjected to PCR (20 μl)
using the SYBR® GreenER™ qPCR SuperMix Universal
(Cat. no. 11762-100, Invitrogen) in a Rotor-Gene™ 3000
thermal cycler (Corbett Research) under the following
conditions: one cycle of 50°C for 5 min and of 95°C for
10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, 60°C for
30 s and 72°C for 30 s. Each sample was tested in triplicate, using a calibrator (28S) as well as positive and notemplate controls. The specificity and identity of individual amplicons were verified by melting curve analysis and
subsequent direct, automated sequencing using the same
primers (individually) as employed for the PCR. Relative
transcriptional differences were calculated from normalised values using method described by Livak and Schmittgen [37].

Results and discussion
Characterisation of Tv-RIO1 and relationship with
selected homologues
The full-length cDNA (designated Tv-rio-1) isolated by
RACE was 2128 nucleotides (nt) (GenBank accession no.
FM209038; Fig. 1) in size and contained a 5'-UTR of 122
nt, an open reading frame (ORF) of 1476 nt and 3'-UTR
of 530 nt. A putative polyadenylation signal (AATAA) was
identified and located 111 nt 3' of the stop codon. The
conceptually translated protein was 491 amino acids in

http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/1/1/34

length and its sequence contained the signature LVHADLSEYNTL (PS01245) characteristic of the RIO1 kinase family [8]. Comparisons with sequences in non-redundant
databases conducted by BLASTx analysis showed that TvRIO1 has significant similarities to related sequences from
a range of organisms, including other nematodes, insects,
vertebrates and plants, although the vast majority of them
have yet to be characterised. The highest amino acid similarities recorded were to the proteins inferred from C.
briggsae gene CBG4203 (e-value: 1e-150; 60% of identity
and 74% of similarity) and from C. elegans gene
M01B12.5 (e-value: 1e-150; 60% of identity and 73% of
similarity) (see http://www.wormbase.org), now recognized as the RIO1 protein kinase. Pairwise comparisons of
amino acid sequence differences between Tv-RIO1 and
selected sequences representing other phyla (mouse,
human, vinegar fly, zebra-fish and yeast; Table 1) revealed
sequence identities ranging from 22.3% to 64.5%. An
alignment of the amino acid sequences of selected RIO1
kinases (Fig. 2) showed conserved regions in the ATPbinding motif (subdomains I and II) and the active site
(subdomain VIb) and other subdomains, including III, V,
VII, VIII, IX and X, suggesting that Tv-RIO1 is functionally
similar to other RIO1 kinases (cf. [8]). The alignment also
showed that the amino acid sequences in regions external
to these subdomains were more divergent (Fig. 2) than
the sequences in the subdomains.
The full-length amino acid sequences of Tv-RIO1
(inferred from cDNA Tv-rio-1) and 21 other homologues
representing a range of different species were aligned and
subjected to phylogenetic analyses (Fig. 3). There was concordance in topology between the MP and NJ trees, and
Tv-RIO1 was closely related to Ce-RIO1 and Cb-RIO1. The
four RIO1 kinases from these nematodes clustered
together, with strong bootstrap support (98–100%), to
the exclusion of molecules from organisms from other
phyla; molecules from plants and vertebrates each formed
separate clades, also supported by strong bootstrap values
(Fig. 3).
Structural model for Tv-RIO1
Recently, crystal structures of the proteins RIO1 and RIO2
have been characterised from Archaeoglobus fulgidus [5,6],
allowing RIO kinases to be defined as a distinct, novel
family of protein kinases. The structure of RIO2 was first
investigated, revealing the presence of two domains [38].
The N-terminal domain, conserved for the RIO2 family
members and not present in the RIO1 protein kinase family, is structurally homologous to the winged helix
(wHTH) domain, seen primarily in DNA-binding proteins. The C-terminal domain, the sequence of which is
conserved between both proteins RIO1 and RIO2, is structurally homologous to known protein kinase (ePK)
domains. The ePKs usually contain 11 conserved sub-

domains that form the catalytic core. Compared with
ePKs, RIO kinase domains resemble a trimmed version of
an ePK kinase domain, containing only eight of these subdomains, lacking the activation loop (subdomain VIII)
and subdomains X and XI which are important for substrate binding [38]. Detailed study of RIO1 and comparisons with RIO2 [39,40] have defined the minimal
consensus RIO-domain that, like ePKs, also contains an
N-lobe, a hinge region, and a C-lobe. However, the RIO
kinase domain contains only three α-helices (αE, αF and
αI) in the C-lobe. All RIO domains contain an additional
α-helix (αR) N-terminal to the canonical N-lobe and a
loop inserted between αC and β3 called "flexible loop".
Study of nucleotide binding by the RIO kinases and comparison with canonical protein kinases [5,6] has identified
specific phosphate-binding loops for subfamily RIO1
domains (with the sequence STGKEA) and RIO2 domains
(with the sequence GxGKES), which are significantly different from their counterpart in ePKs. This finding indicates that the interaction of RIO kinases with the

phosphate moiety and protein substrate is different from
ePKs.
Comparison between protein sequences Tv-RIO1 and AfRIO1 (from A. fulgidus) revealed 38% identity in the ~240
residues containing the RIO domain of Tv-RIO1
(92–325). Based on the crystal structure of Af-RIO1 [38],
the homology model constructed for Tv-RIO1 (Fig. 4)
confirmed that differences between the eukaryotic homologue and the archaeal RIO1 lie mainly in loop regions
which do not contribute to the packing of the three
dimensional structure of the molecule. Most notable is
the loop between the third beta-strand and the alphahelix C of the kinase domain (Fig. 4). This loop, being
highly conserved among eukaryotes, is longer in Tv-RIO1
compared with that in Af-RIO1, and is highly likely to
adopt a different conformation. The residue identified as
the auto-phosphorylation site in this loop in Af-RIO1 is
absent from Tv-RIO1 and RIO1 proteins from other
eukaryotes; therefore, autophosphorylation is likely to
occur at an alternate site. Within this loop in Tv-RIO1,
there is only one available serine, Ser 165, which in the
homology model is positioned at the end of beta-strand 3.

http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/1/1/34

The auto-phosphorylation site identified for RIO2 from A.
fulgidus also lies at the end of this strand, suggesting that
such an autophosphorylation site is indeed possible for
eukaryotic RIO1 proteins. Tv-RIO1 also contains an
extended conserved lysine-rich, C-terminal domain
present in all RIO1 proteins of eukaryotes but not that of
the archaeal A. fulgidus (see [40]). It is presumed that this
region is required for the regulation of RIO1 proteins in
eukaryotes. A recent report [41] has indicated that the Cterminal region of RIO1 is required for the interaction
with and phosphorylation by CK2 in yeast (S. cerevisiae),
and that this phosphorylation regulates the degradation
of RIO1 at the G1/S transition in the cell-cycle.
Transcription in different developmental stages and

Real-time PCR analysis (Fig. 5) showed that the transcription of Tv-rio-1 was greatest in third-stage larvae (L3) of T.
vitrinus. The level of transcription of Tv-rio-1 decreased
from the L3 to the adult worm (Fig. 5), and transcription
was significantly greater (~33 times) in the adult female
compared with the male of T. vitrinus. In spite of the limited information on the transcription and function of
RIO1 protein kinases for most multicellular organisms,

there are important unpublished data for the free-living
nematode C. elegans. In this nematode, genome-wide
RNAi experiments have revealed 'loss-of-function' phenotypes for the gene M01B12.5; these included embryonic
lethality (Emb), slow growth (Gro), larval arrestment
(Lva), larval lethal (Lvl), sick larvae (Sck), fat content
reduced, and reduced brood size (cf. [13-17]). Gene
ontology (GO) analysis also indicates that RIO1 kinase
plays roles in embryonic development, larval development, positive regulation of growth rate and multicellular
organism growth in C. elegans (see WormBase), suggesting
its overall functional importance in growth and development of nematodes. Probabilistic functional gene network analyses [33] predicted that the C. elegans gene
M01B12.5 interacts with seven other molecules, including
Y53C12B.2, C05C8.2, Y105E8B.3, H06H21.3, unc-16,
par-5 and ftt-2 (Fig. 6). Among them, homologues/orthologues of Y53C12B.2, C05C8.2 and H06H21.3 from other
species are involved in RNA binding or nuclear ribosomal
RNA processing, suggesting that M01B12.5 may also be
involved in ribosomal RNA biosynthesis. Although
detailed studies have not yet been conducted, the availability of gene silencing and transgenesis in C. elegans provides excellent scope for detailed investigations into the
functional roles of gene M01B12.5 and the RIO1 protein
kinase it encodes.
