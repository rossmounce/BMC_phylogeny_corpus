Abstract
Background: Ants of the genus Lasius are ecologically important and an important system for
evolutionary research. Progress in evolutionary research has been hindered by the lack of a wellfounded phylogeny of the subgenera, with three previous attempts disagreeing. Here we employed
two mitochondrial genes (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I, 16S ribosomal RNA), comprising 1,265 bp,
together with 64 morphological characters, to recover the phylogeny of Lasius by Bayesian and
Maximum Parsimony inference after exploration of potential causes of phylogenetic distortion. We
use the resulting framework to infer evolutionary pathways for social parasitism and fungiculture.
Results: We recovered two well supported major lineages. One includes Acanthomyops,
Austrolasius, Chthonolasius, and Lasius pallitarsis, which we confirm to represent a seventh subgenus,
the other clade contains Dendrolasius, and Lasius sensu stricto. The subgenus Cautolasius, displaying
neither social parasitism nor fungiculture, probably belongs to the second clade, but its
phylogenetic position is not resolved at the cutoff values of node support we apply. Possible causes
for previous problems with reconstructing the Lasius phylogeny include use of other reconstruction
techniques, possibly more prone to instabilities in some instances, and the inclusion of
phylogenetically distorting characters.
Conclusion: By establishing an updated phylogenetic framework, our study provides the basis for
a later formal taxonomic revision of subgenera and for studying the evolution of various ecologically
and sociobiologically relevant traits of Lasius, although there is need for future studies to include
nuclear genes and additional samples from the Nearctic. Both social parasitism and fungiculture
evolved twice in Lasius, once in each major lineage, which opens up new opportunities for
comparative analyses. The repeated evolution of social parasitism has been established for other

groups of ants, though not for temporary social parasitism as found in Lasius. For fungiculture, the
independent emergence twice in a monophyletic group marks a novel scenario in ants. We present
alternative hypotheses for the evolution of both traits, with one of each involving loss of the trait.
Though less likely for both traits than later evolution without reversal, we consider reversal as
sufficiently plausible to merit independent testing.

Background
Ants of the Northern-hemispheric, temperate genus Lasius
(Formicinae) are scientifically significant, in terms of relative abundance and ecological impact [1,2]. Because of
the diversity of their signal and defense chemistry, Lasius
ants are organisms widely used in chemical ecology [2-7]
and the wide range of colony organisations makes the
genus an ideal system for exploring social evolution [812]. Two further complex traits found in Lasius are yet to
be adequately understood: social parasitism and fungiculture.
Social parasitism implies that one eusocial species
depends on the labour force of another [13-15]. The social
parasitism exhibited in Lasius is temporary in that it is
confined to the early stages of the parasite's colony: the
parasitic queen founds her colony through entering a host
colony where she kills the resident queen and takes over
the worker force [1,2,13]. The study of social parasitism
has become virtually a little discipline of entomology in
itself [2], but the conditions for social parasitism to arise
remain poorly understood [13-20]. Social parasitism has
evolved many times independently in ants [2,13,15,21],

but the evolutionary trajectories at finer systematic scale,
e.g., whether it evolved once or multiply within genera,
have only recently received detailed attention [15,18,2127]. Fungiculture by ants, termites and beetles, on the
other hand, provides a powerful study system for studying
the origin and maintenance of mutualism [28]. In ants,
fungiculture has evolved independently at least twice: in
attines (members of the Myrmicinae), which culture the
fungi for food, and in Lasius ants, which use fungi to build
composite nest walls [29-33]. The patterns of diversification in the intensely studied attine fungiculture are only
gradually starting to be understood, as brought out by
recent papers on leaf-cutter fungiculture which reverse
earlier impressions of certainty for some important issues
[34,35]. For inferences on the evolution of the outstanding ecological and social traits including social parasitism
and fungiculture in Lasius, a well-founded phylogeny of
the genus is needed. There have been three previous studies to resolve the phylogeny of Lasius [36-38], but these
have disagreed with each other in significant respects (Fig.
1).

In the present study we attempt to establish a robust phylogenetic framework for the relationships of the Lasius
subgenera. We apply Bayesian analysis, a powerful tool in
phylogenetic reconstruction of combined data [39] and
not previously applied to Lasius. In addition, we also
apply Maximum Parsimony analysis (MP); MP represents
a completely different computational technique for phylogenetic reconstruction [40] and agreement of the reconstructions by the two independent methods would
increase confidence in the tree. Our approach comprised
five steps. (i) We combined evidence from different data
sets, which for many organisms, including ants, often
yields a stronger phylogenetic signal than using the data
sets singly [18,39,41-50]; specifically, we combined mitochondrial DNA sequence and morphological data. (ii) We
explored potential causes of distortion of the molecular
phylogenetic signal, namely substitution saturation [51],
positive selection [52,53], and compositional heterogeneity [54]. We also assessed which morphological characters
may be functionally coupled with social parasitism
[15,54,55], because similarities in those characters could
reflect convergent adaptations to social parasitic life rather
than reflect common ancestry [56,57]. We then excluded
any suspected cause of distortion in the phylogenetic
reconstruction. To address potential issues of character
exclusion [58], we explored the effect of excluding those
morphological characters suspected to be functionally
coupled with social parasitism by repeating the reconstruction when including them. (iii) We explored whether
the topologies as inferred from the different data sets are
in statistically significant conflict with the phylogenetic
framework inferred from the concatenated data which
would tend to reduce confidence in the latter [59,60]. Our
approach was to handle any conflict arising by collapsing
the affected node. (iv) We explored whether any of the
previous Lasius phylogenies fit our data set as well as our
resulting topology. (v) Finally, we used posterior mapping
[61,62] to define hypotheses on the evolution of social
parasitism and fungiculture in Lasius. In all, the resulting
topology provides a solid basis for studying the evolution
of the various ecologically and sociobiologically relevant
traits of Lasius across subgenera.

Results
We found no evidence for saturation of substitutions, neither for the 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) nor for any of
the codon positions, single or in combination, of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (cox1) data. Tests for positive
selection within the cox1 data indicated that none of the
sites was subject to positive selection. But we did detect
compositional heterogeneity of sequences for the third
codon position of cox1. Recoding the nucleotides of these
sites to purines and pyrimidines successfully eliminated
this effect and we used the recoded sequences for all phylogenetic reconstructions. Scrutinising the morphological

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/237

data set for characters potentially coupled functionally
with social parasitism [1,2,13,54,55,63,64] yielded 37
characters which we hence excluded from our morphological data set. The final data set consisted of 48 samples of
30 species including three outgroup species (Table 1) for
which a total of 1,265 base pairs (bp), and 64 morphological characters were used for phylogenetic reconstruction
(Table 2).
Topology, branch lengths, and Bayesian posterior probabilities of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analyses of the concatenated data (cox1 plus 16S rRNA plus
morphology) are given in Fig. 2. Monophyly of all subgenera was strongly supported (0.98 – 1.00), as were all
nodes defining subgenus relationships (0.99 – 1.00), with
exception of one (0.83), connecting Cautolasius to (Dendrolasius + Lasius sensu stricto). Strictly applying a cutoff for
node support of > 0.95, we retrieved two major lineages,
(((Austrolasius + Acanthomyops) + Chthonolasius) + Lasius
pallitarsis) and ((Dendrolasius + Lasius sensu stricto), but the
position of Cautolasius relative to these two lineages
remains unresolved.
The three individual data set phylogenies (cox1, 16S rRNA,
morphology) differed considerably in phylogenetic resolution at subgenus level and above and none of them
achieved resolution of all nodes scored by the concatenated data reconstruction. Repeating reconstruction of
cox1 without the third codon position did not yield any
well supported nodes that contradicted well supported
nodes in the reconstruction using all three codon positions, which confirms the reliability of the result from the
applied test for substitution saturation. Comparison of
the individual data set topologies with the concatenated
data topology at subgenus level and above revealed not a
single significant (for MCMC, posterior probability >
0.95) disagreement but rather agreement on well supported nodes. The following nodes of the concatenated
topology were supported by the individual data set topologies: cox1 - Cautolasius monophyly, Chthonolasius monophyly, and monophyly of the two Myrmecocystus outgroup
species; 16S rRNA - Cautolasius monophyly, (Austrolasius +
Acanthomyops), and (Chthonolasius + Lasius pallitarsis +
(Austrolasius + Acanthomyops)); morphology - Dendrolasius
monophyly and (Austrolasius + Acanthomyops). Including
those morphological characters suspected to be functionally coupled with social parasitism, which we therefore
had excluded before, resulted in an identical topology,
with very similar node support values (Fig. 2), but with a
decrease of the value for the node connecting Cautolasius
to (Dendrolasius + Lasius sensu stricto) from 0.83 to 0.74.
MP reconstructions based on the concatenated data set
significantly (node support threshold of > 70 for MP) confirmed all significant nodes of the Bayesian reconstructions, including retrieving as significant the node

supported (Fig. 2). Considering the lack of significant disagreement between the signals in the individual data set
phylogenies and the confirmation of the Bayesian topology by Maximum Parsimony reconstructions, we regard
the Bayesian concatenated data topology as a phylogenetic framework sufficiently robust for use in subsequent
evolutionary hypotheses ("new" topology in Fig. 1).
Subsequently, we also made a Bayesian reconstruction of
the concatenated molecular data sets (cox1 plus 16S
rRNA), without any morphological data, to allow for
DNA based estimates of branch length. This tree (inset in
Fig. 2) was in large agreement with the other Bayesian
trees, in topology and branch lengths, but in addition to
the node connecting Cautolasius to (Dendrolasius + Lasius
sensu stricto), three previously well supported nodes now
lacked significant support (Acanthomyops monophyly;
node connecting Chthonolasius to (Austrolasius + Acanthomyops); Lasius sensu stricto monophyly).
In additional rounds of reconstruction, we enforced the
subgenus relationships recovered in three previous phylogenetic analyses [36-38] as constraints (Fig. 1) on our concatenated data. All reconstructions with constraints had
lower likelihood values than the reconstruction without
constraint (Table 3) and, on the basis of our concatenated
data, Bayes factor analysis revealed very strong evidence
against all previously suggested subgenus relationships
(Table 4).
The Bayesian posterior probabilities for the occurrence of
social parasitism and fungiculture at the nodes of the phylogenetic framework above subgenus level ("new" topology in Fig. 1) are shown in Table 5. For eight of the ten
possible inferences a state was significantly inferred (p >
0.95), for the remaining two the probability values were
0.70 and 0.82.

Discussion and Conclusion
The new phylogenetic framework
The new phylogenetic framework we present clarifies the
relationships of all but one subgenus, namely the position

of Cautolasius relative to the other subgenera: MP reconstructions significantly support the topology, Cautolasius +
(Dendrolasius + Lasius sensu stricto), and Bayesian reconstructions do not contradict it. Given the lack of significant support in the Bayesian tree, we nevertheless
subsequently refrain from considering the node as
resolved ("new" topology in Fig. 1). This lack of significant resolution does not affect considerations on the evolution of social parasitism and fungiculture, though,
because the ancestral state of Lasius was absence of both
traits (Table 5), and because also Cautolasius displays neither trait. A significantly supported sister-status to (Dendrolasius + Lasius sensu stricto) thus would not alter any
conclusions (see discussion below). The previous phylogenies were recovered by various methods and we discuss
below how the methods applied may have influenced the
respective results. Taken together, the reasons for the
increased robustness that we postulate for the new phylogenetic framework, which robustness is highlighted also
by the confirmation of our Bayesian topology by our MP
reconstructions, may be that (1) we excluded potential
causes of phylogenetic distortion and (2) used additional
analysis methods, that (3) the phylogenetic signal of combined data is potentially stronger than that of individual
data sets [18,39,41-50], especially when applying Bayesian inference [39], that (4) all nodes but one at subgenus
level or above were significantly supported in our concatenated analysis (Fig. 2), and that (5) we did not recover any
disagreement between the individual data set phylogenies
and the concatenated data topologies. Nevertheless,
because the molecular data of this paper all derive from
mitochondrial DNA, we cannot absolutely exclude that
the tree is influenced by introgression at very shallow levels. Nuclear pseudogenes are also a concern, but we consider it unlikely that we amplified these because neither
reading frame shifts nor sequence ambiguities were apparent. The possibilities of incomplete lineage sorting and of
selection driven by symbionts which are in disequilibrium with mtDNA [65] cannot be ruled out, but such
effects are unlikely to confound clade history at a deeper
level, such as that of subgenera. It remains true that future

studies using multiple nuclear genes are desirable to confirm our findings.
The new phylogenetic framework presented here confirms
the monophyly of the six subgenera. The new framework
also affirms the taxonomic placement of Acanthomyops as
a subgenus of Lasius [66]. Moreover, there is additional
evidence for treating Lasius pallitarsis as a separate, monotypic subgenus, as suggested earlier [38]. Detailed morphological characterisation of the new subgenus and
taxonomic implications will be followed up elsewhere in
the frame of a formal taxonomic revision.
The evolution of the Lasius subgenera occurred in two
major lineages, the first lineage comprising Acanthomyops,
Austrolasius, Chthonolasius, and Lasius pallitarsis, and the
second lineage comprising Dendrolasius, and Lasius sensu
stricto, with Cautolasius probably belonging to the second
lineage (Fig. 2). Within the first lineage Acanthomyops and
Austrolasius form a crown-group which is sister to Chthonolasius.

the new framework. In terms of subgenera, the two W55
lineages agree with those of the new framework with the
exception of Lasius pallitarsis (treated as L. sitkaensis and
believed to belong to Lasius sensu stricto at the time [36]).
However, there are disagreements within the two lineages.
Within the first lineage, the situation is ambiguous
because Austrolasius, found in the new framework to be
sister to Acanthomyops, was treated as part of Chthonolasius.
Within the second lineage, the relations differ in that
Lasius sensu stricto is considered sister to Cautolasius in
W55, whereas it is sister to Dendrolasius in the new framework. Reasons for the disagreements could include that
W55 is based on morphological information only, and
that it lacked a formal reconstruction algorithm.

Comparison with previous phylogenies
The new framework disagrees with previous topologies
[36-38]. Given that we actively sought to exclude potential factors causing phylogenetic distortion from our data,
and that the previous phylogenies disagreed with each
other (Fig. 1), we suggest that where our topology disagrees with previous ones the new one is preferable (Table
4). Examination of the reasons for disagreements between
the new topology and previous schemes is desirable and
we now address this.

In the phylogeny by Hasegawa of 1998 [37] (H98), there
was only one significantly supported (i.e., for MP, node
support > 70 [67]) subgenus relationship, i.e., that Cautolasius, Chthonolasius, and Lasius sensu stricto form a crowngroup sister to Dendrolasius, and this is not supported by
the new framework. Reasons for the disagreement could
include that H98 had very limited taxon sampling, and
that no check for compositional heterogeneity was undertaken: The reconstruction methods applied (Neighbour
Joining and Maximum Parsimony) could also contribute
as the genetic distance based Neighbour Joining reconstruction is known to have the limitation that rate variation among sites cannot be accurately accounted for [68],
and as MP ignores the possible existence of a range of
alternative topologies that are not significantly less likely
than the most parsimonious one, even though they would
require more evolutionary changes [40].

The phylogeny by Wilson published in 1955 [36] (W55)
is the only one of the previous phylogenies that hypothesised the existence of two major lineages as recovered in

The subgenus relationships recovered by Janda and coworkers in 2004 [38] (J04), placing Lasius sensu stricto in a

sis sister to the rest, are not supported by the new framework. However, our data confirm two important aspects
of J04, the allocation of Acanthomyops to the genus Lasius,
and the discovery that Lasius pallitarsis does not belong to
Lasius sensu stricto or any other of the established subgenera. Reasons for the disagreements with the new framework could include that the DNA data of J04 add up to a
total of only 568 bp and that no check for compositional
heterogeneity was undertaken. Moreover, while the combination of molecular with other data by Janda et al.
marks an advance in the history of Lasius phylogeny, the
morphological data included 33 characters (Additional
File 1) that, as indicated by other studies
[1,2,12,51,52,60,61], may possibly be coupled functionally with social parasitism. Scrutiny in morphological
character selection was recently confirmed as crucial in
phylogenetic reconstruction [69]. Also, the occurrence of
social parasitism itself was included as character. These
characters might contribute to grouping all parasitic subgenera together in an unresolved crown group as indeed is
the case in J04 (additionally including Cautolasius),
whereas they were distributed over the two major lineages
in the new framework. The phylogenetic reconstruction
methods applied (Maximum Parsimony) could possibly
have contributed to suboptimal reconstruction as compared to Bayesian inference, especially for combined data
sets, demonstrated after the publication of Janda et al.
[39]. Possibly none of these various causes had a strong
effect per se, as suggested by rather minor differences
between the Bayesian trees based on the concatenated
data excluding versus including those morphological characters suspected to be coupled with social parasitism as
well as between the Bayesian and the MP trees when
excluding those morphological characters (Fig. 2). The
various causes may, however, have added up to a significant effect, as is suggested by the lack of significant support for the sister-group relationship in the MP tree when
including those morphological characters (0.68), which

Hypotheses on the evolution of social parasitism and
fungiculture
The new phylogenetic framework ("new" topology in Fig.
1) and the reconstructed ancestral states (Table 5) suggest
that both social parasitism and fungiculture evolved two
times independently within Lasius, once in each of the
major lineages (Fig. 3). For social parasitism such parallel
evolution within a monophyletic group is not surprising
in general. It has long been established that the combination of certain traits resulted in a predisposition for social
parasitism in two (Myrmicinae and Formicinae) of the 21
[70] ant subfamilies [2,15,71]. Evidence that social parasitism also evolved multiple times within tribes
[16,24,72] or within genera [15,21,22,25,27] confirms
the principle for lower taxonomic levels. Having a reliable
phylogenetic framework for Lasius facilitates examination
of temporary social parasitism, considered less derived
than other types of social parasitism [13,15,24]. One factor that may have favoured the rise of parasitism in Lasius
may derive from their colony organisation: In several species of the non-parasitic subgenera, Lasius sensu stricto and
Cautolasius, the lack of aggression between different single-queened colonies has been reported [8,17,73,74].
Whereas this behaviour concerns intraspecific interactions, the predisposition to reduce aggression may have
been important for social parasitism to arise. The paramount significance of reduced aggression is illustrated by
the chemical disguise of founding queens of Chthonolasius
to appease host workers [1,2] and the exceptional winter
activity of L. (Ch.) mixtus to ease entry to the then less
aggressive host colonies [1]. Characterisation of such
potentially preadaptive traits and search for them in
extant non-parasitic Lasius species might help in finding
potential early stages of incipient social parasitism. Such
discoveries would then contribute to resolving mechanisms in the evolution of social parasitism in general [1417]. Fungiculture on the other hand only is known from
one other group of ants, the Attini (Myrmicinae). It is
established that fungiculture arose only once in attines
[35,75] and the Lasius situation might thus indicate a
stronger predisposition to evolve fungiculture for ants
generally.

For the evolution of both fungiculture and social parasites
two pairs of alternative hypotheses remain (Fig. 3), both
concerning the lineage of (((Lasius pallitarsis + ((Chthonolasius + (Austrolasius + Acanthomyops))). This is because for
both traits the probability value for the ancestral state for
one node was below 0.95 (Table 5). For each trait there is
one scenario considering an earlier origin with subsequent loss in the respective lineage, and the other considering an origin at a later stage in the respective lineage.

Concerning both traits the hypothesis of a reversal is less
likely from the point of view of biological realism because
it is less parsimonious, and also because the probability
values for the respective nodes (2 and 3) indicate, though
not significantly, that social parasitism and fungiculture
had not yet evolved at those stages (0.70 and 0.82). Still,
we cannot formally refute the reversal scenarios here,
given the lack of statistical support, and briefly discuss
them in the below.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/237

used the framework to define hypotheses of the evolution
of two outstanding traits, social parasitism and fungiculture, the evolution of which continues to pose riddles to
evolutionary biology. Our results suggest that both traits
arose twice in Lasius which opens up new opportunities
for comparative analyses in a close phylogenetic relationship. We present competitive hypotheses that either do or
do not involve reversal from the traits.

Methods
For social parasitism, a reversal has been considered generally unlikely [2,17]. On the other hand, reversal from
temporary social parasitism may be more likely than
reversal from any other, more derived type of social parasitism. For example, temporarily socially parasitic ant species of Formica sensu stricto that are capable of alternative
nest foundation through colony budding or adoption
into another colony show a certain flexibility in the nest
foundation mode in this type of social parasitism [1]. On
the other hand, the fact that Acanthomyops, Austrolasius,
and Chthonolasius form an entirely socially parasitic clade
shows that temporary social parasitism may in fact be a
stable trait and makes reversal appear less likely.
Once arisen, fungiculture is not known to have been lost
in insects and loss has been regarded as improbable [28],
which provides an additional argument against the scenario involving a loss in Lasius. It may, however, be more
probable in the Lasius case: fungiculture for nest building
is probably less likely to entail a high dependence of the
ants as compared to fungiculture for nutrition, which
involves physiological adaptations [75].
It is not possible to definitely decide in favour of any of
the alternative hypotheses at present, neither concerning
social parasitism nor fungiculture, but it is worth considering the question further because a plausible loss of
either would be of considerable evolutionary significance.
For both traits the fossil record may offer answers in combination with a sound molecular clock for Lasius, for
social parasitism by revealing the queen morphology of
the ancestor of the entire major lineage, for fungiculture
by a preserved fungal nest structure. Laboratory experiments may also be helpful for the analysis of both traits,
for social parasitism by checking whether any of the temporary social parasites of the lineage are capable of independent colony foundation, and for fungiculture whether
Chthonolasius colonies can be maintained when deprived
of their fungus.
This study provides a basis for studying the evolution of
the various ecologically and sociobiologically relevant
traits across the ca. 100 [70] species of Lasius, by establishing a phylogenetic framework and resolving the position
of six of the seven lineages at subgenus level. We have

The study system
The species of the ant genus Lasius are currently placed in
six subgenera, Acanthomyops, Austrolasius, Cautolasius,
Chthonolasius, Dendrolasius, and Lasius sensu stricto [70].
The most recent taxonomic revision at the genus level
dates back to 1955 [36]. It recognised four subgenera:
Cautolasius, Chthonolasius, Dendrolasius, and Lasius sensu
stricto. The fifth subgenus, Austrolasius, was established in
1967 [70] and includes one species which had up to then
been placed in Chthonolasius. The sixth subgenus, Acanthomyops, has an unstable history in that its status changed
several times between that of a separate genus and being a
subgenus, mostly of Lasius [70]. Evidence for its inclusion
into Lasius has accumulated [38,76] and it was therefore
formally returned to Lasius [66]. Monophyly of the subgenera is supported by various pieces of evidence [77],
except for Lasius sensu stricto. Lasius sensu stricto harbours
one taxon, L. pallitarsis, which on morphological and
molecular grounds has been hypothesised to best constitute a separate subgenus [38]. We here validate these earlier findings [38].

Social parasitism is confined to four subgenera, Acanthomyops, Austrolasius, Chthonolasius, and Dendrolasius,
with all species of these subgenera obligatorily displaying
this lifestyle [1,66]. One subgenus, Dendrolasius, is hyperparasitic in that it parasitises parasitic Chthonolasius species [1,36]. Fungiculture is known from two subgenera,
Chthonolasius, and Dendrolasius [34] and, as far as known,
all members of the two subgenera use fungi (B.C. SchlickSteiner, unpublished data; M. Maruyama, unpublished
data; [1]), although New World species still await study.
Taxon sampling
The material of this study is listed in Table 1. It comprises
27 species of Lasius (including one undescribed) representing all 6 of the subgenera currently recognised as well
as Lasius pallitarsis. We thus present data on more than a
quarter of the currently 100 valid extant Lasius species
[70], covering both the Palaearctic and the Nearctic
regions. The number of species per subgenus ranged from
one to 11. Only two and three species each of Chthonolasius and Acanthomyops, respectively, were analysed, with
each sample carefully chosen to be unambiguously identified to species (because the species of these subgenera

are known for their habitual multidirectional hybridisation [78,79] which is likely to compromise the resolving
power of gene sequences [80] and distorts morphological
characters [79]). To account for intraspecific diversity, up
to four colonies per species were included wherever possible. Two species of Myrmecocystus, which genus is sister to
Lasius [[42,49]; confirmed by a personal communication
by P.S. Ward, of February 2008], as well as Formica
japonica were used as outgroup. Species were identified
according to [1,36,77,81-83]. Voucher specimens are
deposited at the National Science Museum, Tokyo under
the voucher numbers listed in Table 1.

detail), but we additionally performed the cox1 MCMC
analysis without the third codon position.

Molecular protocols
Some samples were irreplaceable dried museum specimens. Therefore, genomic DNA was extracted from whole
body using a DNAeasy tissue kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) using established protocols [84] without any damage to the voucher specimens. We used 1 μl of DNA (25 –
50 ng/μl) as template for PCR amplification. A 490 – 550
bp region of 16S rRNA was amplified and sequenced
using primers "16Sar-L" 5'-CGCCTGTTTATCAAAAACAT3' and "16Sar-L2" 5'-CCGGTCTGAACTCAGATCATG-3'
originally taken from [85] but the latter one slightly
altered and thus renamed. A ca. 900 bp region of cox1 was
amplified and sequenced using the new, degenerated
primers "Lasius-L" 5'-TAYCCGCCATTAGCTTCAAA-3' and
"Lasius-R" 5'-TGAAATTAAGGATCCAATWGA-3'. Reactions were carried out at 10 μl volumes in a PCR Thermal
Cycler MP (TaKaRa Bio Inc.) under the following conditions: a first cycle of 94°C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles
of 94°C for 30 s, annealing at 50°C for 50 s, and finally
72°C for 1 min for the 16S rRNA; for cox1 all settings were
identical except for annealing which was set to 42°C for 1
min 15 s. PCR products were purified with 0.5 μl of
ExoSap-IT (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). All products
were sequenced in both directions using BigDye Terminator v3.1 (Applied Biosystems) on an ABI 3100 Avant DNA
Sequencer (Applied Biosystems) at the National Science
Museum, Tokyo. The sequence data were deposited at
DNA Data Base of Japan, DDBJ (see Table 1 for accession
numbers).

To avoid any effect from compositional heterogeneity of
sequences [90] on the phylogenetic reconstruction we
separately tested each codon position of cox1 as well as
16S rRNA using the program TREE-PUZZLE 5.2 [91].
When we found indications for compositional heterogeneity we recoded the sequences into purines and pyrimidines and repeated the test.

Exploration of molecular data concerning potential causes
for phylogenetic distortion
The 16S rRNA and cox1 sequences were aligned with
default settings of the program Clustal X v1.83 [86];
ambiguously aligned sites in the 16S rRNA alignment
were excluded. We partitioned the cox1 sequences into the
first, second and third codon positions using the program
DAMBE v4.2.13 [87]. This program was also used to perform tests for the saturation of substitutions [88] on the
cox1 and 16S rRNA data. For cox1 all codon positions were
tested simultaneously, as well as separately. We found no
indication of substitution saturation (see Results for

To detect potential positive selection we used the program
HYPHY [89] accessed through the Datamonkey interface
http://www.datamonkey.org. Mean numbers of nonsynonymous substitutions (dN) and synonymous substitutions (dS) per site (ratio dN/dS) were estimated in the
cox1 data using the fixed effect (two-rate FEL) method and
basing estimates on a Neighbour-Joining tree under the
HKY substitution model. We used a nominal alpha level
of 0.1.

Morphological analysis
The morphological characters considered are presented in
Additional File 1. Our rationale in composing the character set was aiming at, first, a comprehensive capturing of
variation at the species, subgenus and genus level, and,
second, exclusion of any characters potentially distorting
the phylogenetic reconstructions. We started from the
complete set of character definitions of Janda et al. [38].
Pursuing our first aim, we applied 67 characters and their
states exactly as described by [38], adapted – because analysis of our material revealed the necessity to do so – the
definitions of character states, partly also concerning the
number of character states, for another 16 characters, out
of which 7 characters also were adapted in the character
definitions themselves, and added 20 entirely new characters. Pursuing our second aim, we excluded from the set
presented by [38] the three behavioural/ecological characters (among others the occurrence of social parasitism),
and
on

of
information
from
[1,2,13,54,55,63,64] we further excluded 37 morphological characters, including four of the new ones. The
excluded characters were characters which we suspected to
be functionally coupled with temporary social parasitism,
either (i) because of direct functional reasoning, or (ii)
because they are known to be correlated with social parasitism in other ant genera which contain both parasitic
and non-parasitic species. The characters excluded under
(i) concerned the mandible, which is needed by parasitic
Lasius queens to dismember host workers and strangle the
host queen; the maxillary palp and the scape, which may
be under selective pressure to be short and robust so as to
escape damage by aggressive hosts in the initial stage of
colony take-over; and the mesosoma size, because parasitic, i.e., dependently founding, queens need less tissue

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:237

storage than independently founding queens. The characters excluded under (ii) concerned the length of hairs,
which can be either extremely long or extremely short in
parasites; the pubescence, which is absent in some parasites; the size of the head and the overall body, which both
are frequently small in parasitic queens; and the shape of
the petiole, which is frequently aberrant in parasites. We
finally also excluded three characters for which we
observed no variation in our material (their general lack
of variation for the species analysed confirmed by a personal communication by B. Seifert, of April 2008). For
details of how we composed our morphological data set
including information on the provenance of characters
and whether we excluded them, see Additional File 1.
Overall, we included 64 morphological characters in our
reconstructions; 35 of these concern adult workers, 18
adult queens, 23 adult males, and 2 worker larvae; 47 are
binary and 17 are multi-state. To explore the effect of
excluding characters, as we had done, on phylogenetic
reconstructions, we also subjected the complete data set to
reconstructions (but excluding invariant characters); this
data set included 99 characters. We assessed any morphological data by analysis of voucher material housed in the
National Science Museum, Tokyo, except the three characters concerning larval morphology. A total of 155 specimens were analysed. All multistate characters were treated
as unordered.
Phylogenetic reconstructions
To select the best-fitting nucleotide substitution models
for cox1 and 16S rRNA we used the hierarchical likelihood
ratio test (hLRT) and the Akaike Information Criterion
(AIC) implemented in the program MrModeltest 2.2 [92].
When sequence partitions had been recoded into purines
and pyrimidines, models were adjusted to account for the
two state character of the data. AIC and hLRT in one
instance differed in the selection of models for the single
DNA sequence data partitions (Table 2). AIC selected the
more parameter rich model and we opted for this solution
as erring on the side of overparameterisation is preferable
over the opposite [93,94].

For the morphological data the Markov k (Mk) model
[95] was applied both with (+Γ) and without gamma-distributed rates of character change in separate MCMC runs.
We used Bayes factors for model selection as they are
established to provide good orientation tools in this [39]
and calculated them as follows, using the outcomes of the
single MCMC runs: 2LnB10 = 2 × (Harmonic Mean Ln likelihood for Mk – Harmonic Mean Ln likelihood for
Mk+Γ). In the interpretation of the yielded absolute value
of 2.5 in favour of the Mk+Γ model we followed published recommendations [96], on page 777, and consequently used the Mk+Γ model for all reconstructions.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/237

Bayesian analysis using MCMC was performed with
MrBayes 3.1.2 [97] on the individual data sets (cox1, 16S
rRNA, morphology) and the combined, concatenated
data set (cox1 plus 16S rRNA plus morphology). We also
analysed the combined, concatenated data set including
those morphological characters suspected to be coupled
with social parasitism. In addition, we analysed the concatenated molecular data (cox1 plus 16S rRNA) without
any morphological data. Data partitions were established
to allow model parameters to be separately estimated for
all partitions and additionally for the single codon positions of cox1. 10,000,000 generations with a sample frequency set to 100 were run. As after 9,000,000 generations
stationarity was achieved with average standard deviation
of split frequencies in all cases constantly below 0.002
except the reconstruction with the W55 constraint for
which it was 0.063 (Table 3), we always used the last
10,000 trees of each run to compute a majority rule consensus tree assigning posterior probabilities of tree topology. We also confirmed that true convergence had been
reached and that the MCMC was sampling from the posterior distribution by repeating all runs three times and
checking for congruence across the runs. All runs were performed using parallel versions of MrBayes, implemented
on a SGI Origin 3800 under IRIX version 6.21m, of HPC,
James Cook University. All MCMC runs achieved stationarity and detailed statistics on the runs are presented in
Table 3. In the interpretation of the MCMC trees we followed previous authors [94,98,99] to regard only nodes
with node support of p > 0.95 as significantly supported
in Bayesian analysis. We also applied this cutoff when
comparing the MCMC trees based on the individual data
sets and that based on the concatenated data.
We also performed MP analysis of the combined, concatenated data, as well as of the combined concatenated data
adding those morphological characters suspected to be
coupled with social parasitism. All MP analyses were
unweighted and performed with PAUP* 4.0b10 [100]
using the heuristic search algorithm with tree bisection
reconnection branch swapping and 10 random stepwise
additions. All characters were treated as unordered and
polymorphic states were taken into account. Node support was calculated by 1,000 bootstrap replicates. In the
interpretation of the MP trees, we applied the widely
accepted node support threshold of > 70 [67].
We deposited the aligned, concatenated data matrix with
TreeBase (Study accession number S2136).
Comparison with previous Lasius phylogenies
To compare the subgenus relationships of W55, H98 and
J04 directly with the new, Bayesian framework, we
enforced the various topologies as constraints (Fig. 1) on
our concatenated data. We then performed additional

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:237

MCMC runs of our concatenated data under these constraints and compared the outcomes of the single MCMC
runs using Bayes factors as given under morphological
analyses. In extracting the topologies from the literature
we proceeded as follows. For W55 we used the tree of "Fig.
2" of [36] slightly modified. We adopted the position of
Acanthomyops, explicitly treated as ingroup of Lasius in the
tree, although Wilson did not formally treat Acanthomyops
as a subgenus of Lasius in the taxonomic revision itself. We
allocated Lasius sitkaensis, now treated as a junior synonym of L. pallitarsis, to Lasius sensu stricto. A similar situation pertains to Austrolasius: the subgenus had not yet
been established in 1955, but the then only known species which today is treated under Austrolasius, L. carniolicus, was allocated to Chthonolasius and we accounted for
this in our treatment of W55. For H98 we applied the
node support threshold of > 70 [67] to the Maximum Parsimony reconstruction presented in "Fig. 1" of [37], and
we applied the same threshold for J04, to the Maximum
Parsimony reconstruction presented in "Fig. 6" of [38].
Posterior mapping analysis
To estimate the probabilities of the possible ancestral
states at each well supported node of the concatenated
Bayesian topology we chose the Bayesian approach of
posterior mapping [61,62], using the program SIMMAP
1.0 [101] freely available online http://www.SIM
MAP.com. In contrast to parsimony approaches to character mapping this is a probabilistic approach, which (i)
does not assume that only a single change has occurred
along any branch, and (ii) is not prone to underestimation of the variance in ancestral state assignments [101].
Further, the SIMMAP approach allows uncertainty in phylogenetic reconstruction. A single stochastic mapping was
done per tree using the last 2,000 post-burnin trees of the
20,000 trees used to derive the consensus tree of Fig. 2 and
the ancestral states were inferred for the consensus tree
from the MrBayes analysis.

Definition and data matrix of morphological characters. L worker
larva, M adult male, Q adult queen, W adult worker. The characters are
consecutively numbered in the definitions which equal the numbers used
in the matrix. The numeric codes for the character state definitions are
given in parentheses. If a species is polymorphic in character states, both
states are given in parantheses. In the penultimate row, the corresponding
character name of Janda et al. [38] is given and the following signs
describe the relation to [38] concerning the definitions, "*" indicates that
character and states are identical, "**" indicates that the characters are
identical but the states have been adapted, "***" that characters and
states have been adapted, and "****" indicates new characters, not used
in [38]. The letters in ultimate row indicate: "a" character used for reconstruction of new phylogenetic framework, "b" character suspected to be
functionally coupled with social parasitism or a behavioural/ecological
character, "c" invariant character. The samples of the matrix are identical
with those given in Table 1. Subgenera are abbreviated as in Table 1.
