Abstract
Background: The moss Physcomitrella patens is an emerging model in comparative plant science.
At present, the Physcomitrella genome is sequenced at the Joint Genome Institute (USA). In this
study we present our results on the development of expressed sequence tag-derived microsatellite
markers for Physcomitrella patens, their classification and applicability as genetic markers on the
intra- as well as on the interspecies level. We experienced severe restrictions to compare our
results on Physcomitrella with earlier studies for other plant species due to varying microsatellite
search criteria and a limited selection of analysed species. As a consequence, we performed a side
by side analysis of expressed sequence tag-derived microsatellites among 24 plant species covering
a broad phylogenetic range and present our results on the observed frequencies.
Results: We identified 3,723 microsatellites using the software MISA in a non-redundant
Physcomitrella expressed sequence tag database comprising more than 37 megabases of nucleotide
information. For 2,951 microsatellites appendant primer sequences have been derived. PCR of 376
microsatellites yielded 88 % successful amplicons and over 30 % polymorphisms between two
Physcomitrella accessions. The polymorphism information content of 64 microsatellites based on 21
different Physcomitrella accessions was comparably high with a mean of 0.47 +/- 0.17. Of the 64
Physcomitrella microsatellite markers, 34 % respectively 79.7 % revealed cross-species applicability
in two closely related moss species.
In our survey of two green algae, two mosses, a fern, a fern palm, the ginkgo tree, two conifers,
ten dicots and five monocots we detected an up to sevenfold variation in the overall frequency with
a minimum of 37 up to maximal 258 microsatellites per megabase and a high variability among the
different microsatellite class and motif frequencies. Numerous species-specific microsatellite
frequencies became evident and several deviations to earlier reports were ascertained.
Conclusion: With the Physcomitrella microsatellite marker set a valuable tool has been made
available for further genetic and genomic applications on the intra- as well as on the interspecies
level. The comparative survey of expressed sequence tag-derived microsatellites among the plant
kingdom is well suited for a classification of future studies on plant microsatellites.

Background
The moss Physcomitrella patens (Hedw.) B. S. G. is an
important model organism for comparative studies in
plant science [1]. The ancestors of mosses and seed plants
separated shortly after the transition from water to land at
least 500 million years ago [2,3]. The moss Physcomitrella
is therefore placed in a phylogenetic key position between
the green algae and the seed plants. Physcomitrella displays
an exceptionally high rate of homologous recombination
[4], which is a unique characteristic among plants. This
facilitates direct replacement of genomic loci to knock-out
or knock-in genes in order to enable their fast and
straightforward functional characterisation [5]. Functional mutations are furthermore facilitated by the dominating haploid gametophyte of the moss. Besides,
Physcomitrella is easy to handle in vitro and to transfect,
and is regarded as a rich source of novel genes [6]. More
than 200,000 sequenced cDNA fragments, so called
expressed sequence tags (ESTs), derived from the worldwide labstrain 'Gransden' have been assembled and annotated in a non-redundant database, a Physcomitrella gene
index [7-9]. At present, the Physcomitrella patens genome is
sequenced by a whole genome shotgun approach at the
Joint Genome Institute (USA) and the appendant international moss genome consortium collaborates in processing and assembling the genome data. Little is known
about the genome organisation yet. The Physcomitrella
genome is of intermediate size with about 511 megabases
[10] and cytogenetic analyses indicate a chromosome
number of n = 27 [11]. Neither molecular markers nor
genetic linkage maps have been established so far. Thus
our objective was to establish EST-derived microsatellites
in order to be able to create a genetic map for Physcomitrella patens.
Microsatellites or simple sequence repeats (SSRs) denote
a DNA class of mono- up to hexanucleotide sequence
repeats dispersed over the whole genome with an accumulation in nonrepetitive DNA and untranslated 3'- and 5'regions of genes [12,13]. SSRs are currently preferentially
applied as molecular markers in numerous organisms particularly with regard to their unique hypervariabilty combined with co-dominance, specificity and reproducibility
[14,15]. The main disadvantage of SSRs as markers has
been their time consuming development in the laboratory
[16]. However, with the fast-paced increase of nucleic acid
sequences during the last decade it became practicable to
screen in silico for microsatellites in sequence databases
for a growing number of organisms. Several tools have
been made available for the computational database mining of SSRs, reviewed in [17]. Apart from genomic
sequences, especially the large number of availble ESTs
and the respective databases have been used extensively to
derive SSRs, for example [18-23]. A big advantage of ESTderived markers is their non-anonymity. Each marker is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/6/9

absolutely linked to a distinct gene and therefore to its
known or putative function. Moreover, each marker
sequence can be extended by the underlying EST. This in
particular can be of great benefit in the implementation of
genetic markers and linkage maps as a scaffold for physical mapping.
A clear-cut comparison of the first large scale EST-based
SSR search for a moss with results obtained for other plant
species was virtually impossible due to the large differences in the applied SSR search strategies concerning the
redundancy and the chosen parameters for the minimal
SSR motif length or the inclusion/exclusion of imperfect
SSRs [17]. In wheat, for example, this differences led to
reported SSR frequencies ranging from 57 [24] up to
1,350 [12] SSR per megabase. Furthermore, comparative
analyses of SSR frequencies based on large scale computational database searches have been limited to only a few
groups of mono- and dicots [12,13,18].
In this study we present our results on the development of
SSR markers for Physcomitrella patens based on clustered
EST data, their classification and characterisation and
their applicability as genetic markers on the intra- as well
as on the interspecies level. For a better classification of
our results on Physcomitrella SSRs, we performed a comparative side by side EST-based SSR search in 24 phylogenetically well distributed plant species including two
green algae, two mosses, a fern, a fern palm, the ginkgo
tree, two conifers, ten dicots and five monocots and
present our results on the observed SSR frequencies.

Results and discussion
Within the Physcomitrella patens gene index dimer SSRs
are most frequent
We analysed 48,961 virtual Physcomitrella transcripts with
the MISA software [25,26]. In 3,108 (6.3 %) of the EST
sequences one or more microsatellites were found, 3,723
microsatellite motifs were detected in total. This corresponds to a frequency of 98.8 SSR counts per mega base
pairs (counts/Mbp) and one SSR per 10.1 kilo base pairs
(kbp). Interestingly, the majority of the SSRs were dimer
repeats with 2,095 individual SSRs (56.3 %), whereas
only 1,315 (35.3 %) were trinucleotide repeats. This is an
unexpected result because trimer repeats are reported to
be the most frequent SSRs in plant ESTs [17]. Other SSRs
were 273 (7.3 %) tetranucleotides, 39 (1.1 %) pentanucleotides and one hexanucleotide SSR (Table 1). This corresponds to SSR counts/Mbp of 55.6 for dimers, 34.9 for
trimers, 7.2 for tetramers, 1.0 for pentamers and 0.03 for
hexamers, respectively. Among each of the SSR classes the
different possible repeat motifs were not evenly distributed (Table 1). The average motif length including compound SSRs was 21.3 base pairs (bp) with 26 % of the
motifs being larger than 20 bp.

472 EST sequences contained more than one SSR. 381
ESTs contained two SSRs (80.7 %), 59 contained three
(12.5 %), 23 contained four (4.9 %), six contained five
(1.3 %) and one EST each contained six, seven respectively 13 SSRs (each 0.2 %). For the generation of PCR
markers, multiple SSRs in one EST being separated by less
than 100 bp were defined as in 'compound formation'
and subsequently handled as one single potential marker.
Multiple SSRs being separated by more than 100 bp were
further treated as separate single marker loci. In total,
3,171 SSRs were available as potential marker loci, comprising 2,924 SSRs in single and 247 SSRs in compound
formation.
A high rate of Physcomitrella SSRs are PCR applicable
Oligonucleotide primer sequences were successfully
derived for 2,951 (93 %) of the 3,171 single and compound microsatellites using the Primer3 [27] software in
batch mode with MISA. Primers could not be designed for

SSR motifs comprising too short or inappropriately composed flanking sequences.
For 376 SSRs, primer pairs were synthesized and PCR was
performed using the standard Physcomitrella lab strain
'Gransden'. PCR led to successful product amplifications
in 329 of 376 SSRs (87.5 %), of which 27 SSR amplicons
(7.2 %) yielded longer sequences than expected (size difference from 0.1 up to 2 kbp), most likely due to presence
of introns. The frequency of successfully amplified SSRs
was more than 20 % higher than described for Hordeum
vulgare, where SSR markers were also derived with MISA/
Primer3 [25]. This may be due to the high quality of the
clustered Physcomitrella EST database and our specific PCR
conditions with a touchdown PCR and a decreased final
primer annealing temperature. Moreover, differing intron
frequencies with 22 % in Hordeum [25] and 8.4 % in Physcomitrella, as detected in SSR amplicons, may also contribute to the higher rate of successful PCRs in Physcomitrella.

PCR amplification patterns of EST-derived microsatellites of Physcomitrella patens in two accessions. Exemplary
SSR marker A â L were amplified in two Physcomitrella patens accessions, the standard lab strain 'Gransden' (1) and 'VillersexelK3' (2) originating from England and France, respectively. The SSR marker A shows a double banding. The SSRs A, B, D, F and
I reveal no visible size polymorphism between the two accessions. The SSRs C, E and G reveal distinct visible single size polymorphisms between the two accessions. The SSRs J, K and L show possible small size polymorphisms between the two accessions which have to be further confirmed. The SSR marker H shows an unexpected size shift, most likely due to an intron.
DNA size markers (M) is a 100 bp ladder (SIGMA-Aldrich).

The Physcomitrella SSR markers display a high degree of
polymorphism
The applicability of the EST-derived SSRs as molecular
markers could be proven with side by side amplification
of the 376 SSRs in the lab strain 'Gransden' and the french
accession 'Villersexel-K3', both of which we are using as
parental lines in a genetic mapping approach. 110 markers (33.1 %) were polymorphic between the two accessions (Figure 1).

The informative properties of the EST-derived microsatellites were further evaluated in 64 SSR markers selected
from the 376 markers and a collection of 21 worldwide
Physcomitrella accessions (Table 2, Figure 2). In total, 238
alleles, including 30 null alleles (13.2%), were detected
with a maximum of 7 alleles and an average of 3.7 alleles
per SSR. Only one SSR turned out to be monomorphic in
the analysed accessions. The polymorphism information
content (PIC) based on the 21 Physcomitrella accessions
was calculated for all 64 SSR markers. PIC values ranged

two related Funariaceae, Physcomitrium sphaericum (22) and Funaria hygrometrica (23). The SSR marker reveals at least six distinct alleles. Single alleles were found in the plants 1 â 13, 14 â 16, 17, 18 â 21, 22 and 23 respectively. Among the plants 1 â 13
potentially more alleles are present with only small size differences. DNA size markers (M) are a combination of a 100 bp and

from 0.0 â 0.78 with a mean PIC value of 0.47 Â± 0.17. This
PIC is comparably high for EST-derived SSRs, which are
generally known to be less informative than SSRs derived
from genomic sequences [28,29]. An explanation for the
high amount of SSR polymorphism, including numerous
null alleles, could be a high degree of genetic diversity in
the studied accessions.

gare, Festuca arundinacea, Oryza sativa, Medicago truncatula
and Picea taeda, where the transferability decreased with
increasing phylogenetic distance and transfer success rates
differed from 96 % to 40 % [17,25,30-32].

Physcomitrella SSR markers are cross-species applicable
Physcomitrella patens belongs to the family Funariaceae. To
gain insight into the interspecies transferability, the 64
Physcomitrella SSR marker were analysed in two further
species of the Funariaceae, Physcomitrium sphaericum and
Funaria hygrometrica (Table 1, Figure 2). Whereas 51 SSR
PCRs (79.7 %) performed well in the more closely related
Physcomitrium sphaericum, only 22 (34 %) did so in the
more distantly related Funaria hygrometrica (Figure 2).
Given this data, we estimate that for Physcomitrium sphaericum about 2,350 Physcomitrella SSRs with the appendant
primer pairs can be transferred directly and still about
1,000 Physcomitrella SSRs are applicable in Funaria hygrometrica. Hence, researchers working on closely related
moss species may benefit from the Physcomitrella SSRs.

Datasets of 24 plant species covering a broad phylogenetic
spectrum
We aimed to achieve a clear-cut comparison of our results
for Physcomitrella with those of other plant species. Unfortunately, to classify surveys on EST-derived SSRs was
rather complicated due to large differences in the applied
SSR search strategies and by the limited number of analysed species. As a consequence, we identified microsatellites in a comparative side by side search using the MISA
software upon the gene indices of 24 plants species.
Accounting for the present availability of EST sequences,
the species selection encompasses as many major clades
of the plant kingdom as possible. In total, two green algae,
two true mosses, a fern, a fern palm, the ginkgo tree, two
conifers, ten dicots and five monocots were analysed (see
Additional file 5). However, for some classes among the
plants no appropriate EST datasets were available, e. g. liverworts, hornworts and magnoliidae.

Our results are in accordance with prior reports about
interspecies transferability of EST-derived SSRs for numerous seed plants including Triticum aestivum, Hordeum vul-

The chosen plant sequence datasets consisted of assembled and non redundant EST sequences ('tentative consensus sequences') and of single non redundant ESTs

('singletons'). While the gene indices were build using the
same principal method, there are slight variations in the
chosen assembly parameters for each of the four databases
they originate from, namely The Institute for Genomic
Research (TIGR) [33,34], Plant Genome Database (PlantGDB) [35,36], COSMOSS [9,37] and New York Plant
Genomics Consortium (NYPG) [38-40]. Methodological
variations in generation of the underlying cDNA
sequences, e. g. 5'-, 3'- or full length cDNA enrichment,
may have led to additional bias in the datasets. Since EST
databases are available for only a limited number of species yet, and because they may be affected by a certain
bias, care has to be taken in relating deviating observations to certain plant classes or biological characteristics.
The sequence databases ranged in size from 2 megabases
up to over 93 megabases of nucleotide information. The
overall average EST sequence length was 733 bp with a
standard deviation of 180 bp (see Additional file 5). Significantly deviating sequence lengths were detected for
Aquilegia, Arabidopsis and Oryza with long average
sequence lengths of 1129, 1184 and 1053 bp and Adiantum, Cycas and Helianthus with short average sequence
lengths of 483, 476 and 478 bp, respectively. The long
sequence averages indicate a better coverage, whereas the
short ones most likely are due to a more fragmentary coverage of the full length cDNAs. The dependency of the
long average sequence length on coverage of the individual transcript could be confirmed for the Arabidopdsis GI
which contains more than 5,000 full length cDNA
sequences [33]. Because of the extreme EST sequence
length variablity in the different datasets, we believe it to
be better to compare EST-derived SSR frequencies by calculating the SSR counts per megabase (counts/Mbp)
rather than by SSRs per EST as has sometimes been done
previously [19,20,30].
The average GC-content in the 24 datasets was 45.4 %
with a standard deviation of 5.3 %. Significantly increased
GC-contents were detected for the green algae
Chlamydomonas and Mesostigma with 58.3 % and 51.7 %,
respectively, the moss Tortula with 53.0 % as well as the
grasses (51.1% for Triticum, 52.5 % for Hordeum, 51.5 %
for Saccharum and 53.7 % for Oryza). Ginkgo, Aquilegia
and Medicago deviated from the average with significantly
reduced GC-contents of 40.0 %, 40.0 % and 39.4 %
respectively.
The overall SSR frequency varies up to sevenfold among
plants
The MISA search statistics for all 24 analysed plant species
have been made available at COSMOSS [41]. The overall
frequency of SSRs varied 6.9 fold among the 24 gene indices (Figure 3, see also Additional file 1). The average SSR
frequency was 114.7 counts/Mbp with a standard devia-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/6/9

tion of +/- 60.1 counts/Mbp. The green alga Mesostigma,
the fern palm Cycas, both conifers (Pinus and Picea) as
well as the monocot Allium cepa were significantly deviating from the average with an extremely reduced SSR frequency of 37.3, 52.9, 41.5, 47.3 and 38.9 counts/Mbp,
respectively. The monocot Oryza, however, as well as the
dicots Aquilegia and Mesembryanthemum revealed a significantly increased frequency with 258, 240 and 239
counts/Mbp, respectively. The high SSR frequency of rice
has been reported in earlier results [18]. The hitherto
unnoted significantly biased frequencies of the further
seven species indicate a much higher variability of ESTderived SSR frequencies among plants than previously
reported. Our data for Cycas, Ginkgo, Picea and Pinus seem
to indicate that a low SSR frequency is an intrinsic characteristic for gymnosperm gene indices. Among the monocots we ascertained the highest variability in the SSR
frequencies with Allium (38.9 counts/Mbp) and Oryza
(258.0 counts/Mbp).
Pearson's correlation coefficients (R) of the SSR frequencies with the average GC-content of the analysed species
were not significant with -0.12 for dimer SSRs, 0.23 for
trimer, 0.24 for other SSRs and 0.04 for the total SSRs.
Thus correlations of SSR frequencies with the average GCcontent of the analysed species could not be concluded
based on our data.
Trimer and dimer SSRs are most frequent except for the
alga Mesostigma
In all datasets, more than 91 % of the detected SSRs were
dimer and trimer repeats with the exception of the green
alga Mesostigma where they accounted for only 58 % of the
total SSRs. Among tetra-, penta- and hexamers, the tetramers are the most abundant in 20 of 24 plants, whereas in
the remaining four plant species hexamer SSRs are most
abundant (Figure 3, see also Additional file 1).

The ratio of the two most common SSR classes, the dimer
and trimer repeats, varied among the datasets. In 15 plants
trimer SSRs were more frequent than dimer SSRs. Interestingly, the higher dimer than trimer SSR frequency of Physcomitrella was also true for eight more species among the
analysed sample. This dominance of dimer SSRs in nine of
24 plants contradicts the general assumption that trimer
SSRs are most frequent in plant ESTs [17].
The average frequency of trimer SSRs is 61.5 counts/Mbp
in the 24 datasets with a standard deviation of +/- 42.8
counts/Mbp. Mesostigma, Ginkgo, and Pinus deviate significantly with only 15.7, 15.8 and 18.6 counts/Mbp, respectively. Aquilegia and Oryza deviate significantly with 151.8
and 201.8 counts/Mbp. The extreme dominance of trimer
SSRs is the main contribution to the observed overall SSR
increase in Aquilegia and even more evidently in Oryza.

Frequencies of microsatellites among the gene indices of 24 plants
Frequencies of microsatellites among the gene indices of 24 plants. The microsatellite frequencies are calculated in
SSR counts per megabase nucleotide information (counts/Mbp) as detected in the gene indices of 24 phylogenetically well distributed plant species. The total SSR frequency is further subclassified into trimer, dimer and other SSRs. Other SSRs consist of
tetramer, pentamer and hexamer SSRs (see also Additional file 1).
The average frequency of dimer SSRs is 46.7 counts/Mbp
with a standard deviation of +/- 28.4 counts/Mbp. Mesostigma, Allium and Mesembryanthemum deviate significantly from the average with only 4.3, 12.6 and
remarkable 152.4 counts/Mbp, respectively. The observed
significant overall SSR increase in Mesembryanthemum is
due to its extremely high dimer SSR frequency. In Mesostigma and Allium, significantly reduced trimer as well as
dimer SSR frequencies were the reason for the low overall
SSR frequency.

In Mesostigma, the observed frequencies were especially
remarkable (see Additional file 1 and the MesostigmaMISA statistics on COSMOSS [41]): Although it showed
the lowest overall SSR frequency of all analysed plants it
revealed by far the highest tetramer SSR frequency with
14.1 counts/Mbp (37.9 % of the total SSRs) and furthermore the second highest pentamer SSR frequency with 2.9
counts/Mbp (7.9 % of the total SSRs). The increased
tetramer frequency was mainly due to an increased AATT/
TTAA motif frequency (9.9 counts/Mbp) and the
increased pentamer frequency due to an increased AAATT/
AATTT frequency (2.4 counts/Mbp).

Average length of dimer as well as trimer microsatellites among the gene indices of 24 plants. The average microsatellite length of dimer as well as trimer SSRs in basepairs (+/- standard deviation) as detected in the gene indices of 24 phylogenetically well distributed plant species (see also Additional file 2).

Dimer SSRs averagely are longer and more variable in
length than trimer SSRs
Dimer SSRs are much more variable in length throughout
the analysed species than trimer SSRs with the exception
of Mesostigma (Figure 4, see also Additional file 2). The
average standard deviation of the dimer SSR length with
+/-11.9 bp is more than two times larger than that of
trimer SSRs with only +/- 5.2 bp. On average, dimer SSRs
(18.7 bp +/- 2.9) were significantly longer (p = 0.03) than
trimer SSRs (17.5 bp +/- 0.8). The reduced average dimer
length in Mesostigma of only 13.0 bp with a small standard
deviation (+/- 1.4 bp) might be correlated to the corresponding reduced dimer counts/Mbp. The average dimer
length was longest in the two conifers with 24.5 bp,
respectively 23.4 bp. Further significant deviations from
the average SSR length (see Additional file 2) could neither be correlated with SSR counts/Mbp nor with certain
taxonomic clades.

The SSR dimer motif AG/CT is exceptionally abundant in
Mesembryanthemum
The abundancies of the four canonical non-redundant
SSR dimer motifs varied strongly among the analysed
plants (Figure 5, see also Additional file 3). The average
counts/Mbp for the SSRs motifs AG/CT, AC/GT, AT/TA
and CG/GC were 27.4 (+/- 27.6), 7.8 (+/- 7.5), 9.8 (+/6.8) and 1.3 (+/- 1.9). The large standard deviations reflect
the extremely varying motif abundancies in the analysed
species. As an amendment to earlier studies, where AG/CT
was found to be the most abundant dimer motif in several
plants [12], in our analysis this was persistent for only 16
of the 24 datasets. In Chlamydomonas, AC/GT and in Mesostigma, Ginkgo, Picea, Pinus, Gossypium, Solanum and
Allium AT/TA was the most abundant dimer SSR motif.
For Picea, the high abundance of AT/TA repeats has been
noted in earlier reports [42]. In Mesembryanthemum an
exceptionally high frequency of the AG/CT motif with 140

increased overall SSR frequency.
Observed abundancies of SSR trimer motifs amend earlier
reports
The abundancies of the ten canonical non-redundant SSR
trimer motifs varied as well (Figure 6, see also Additional
file 4). The average counts/Mbp for the SSRs motifs were
10.8 (+/- 23.3) for CCG/CGG, 4.0 (+/- 3.6) for AGT/ACT,
6.0 (+/- 6.2) for AGG/CCT, 7.1 (+/- 7.2) for AGC/GCT, 4.0
(+/- 3.3) for ACT/ATG, 4.0 (+/- 4.0) for ACG/CGT, 5.8 (+/
- 4.6) for ACC/GGT, 3.5 (+/- 2.8) for AAT/ATT, 12.5 (+/-

15.0) for AAG/CTT and 4.4 (+/- 4.8) for AAC/GTT. Like
for the dimer motifs, the large standard deviations reflect
the extremely varying trimer motif abundancies in the
analysed species. In the four grasses, CCG/CGG was the
most abundant trimer motif and the same was due for
Chlamydomonas. The increased CCG/CGG frequency has
been described earlier for grasses and has been related to
a high general GC-content [12]. In this context the CCG/
CGG increase in Chlamydomonas, which has the the highest GC-content (58.3 %) of all 24 gene indices, was consistent, whereas the low CCG/CGG frequency in the alga
Mesostigma and the moss Tortula, which also had signifi-

The detected low CCG/CGG frequency in Allium contradicts the earlier reported generalisation that an increased
CCG/CGG frequency is specific for monocots [12,18,43].
An exeptionally high frequency of the SSR motif AAG/CTT
contributes to the increased overall SSR frequency in Aquilegia. The canonical motifs encompassing the three stop
codons AAT, ATG and AGT were not exceptionally

Conclusion
In this study we present the first comprehensive overview
of EST-derived microsatellites in a moss, the model plant
Physcomitrella patens. We detected 3,723 SSRs in silico using
clustered and assembled EST data. All 2,951 derived
primer sets are publicly available, making the markers
accessible for PCR analysis. 88 % of the SSRs can be suc-

cessfully applied to PCR. With the EST-derived SSR marker
set a valuable tool has been made available for numerous
further genetic and genomic applications on the intra- as
well as on the interspecies level. Using the SSR markers a
genetic map can be established, the available sequence
extensions by the underlying ESTs will greatly facilitate
the implementation of the SSR marker loci during the
pending iterative assembly process of the Physcomitrella
genome sequence data.
In our comparative survey microsatellites were found with
highly variable abundancies within the EST datasets of 24
phylogenetically well distributed plant species. Interestingly, species belonging to the same phylogenetic group,
such as the two mosses, the dicots as well as the monocots
did not reveal consistent class-specific SSR characteristics.
Rather, species-specificities seem to contribute to the high
overall variation. Two exceptions to this rule are the low
overall SSR frequency of gymnosperm ESTs, which may be
an intrinsic characteristic, and the abundance of the SSR
trimer motif CGG/CCG, which seems to be a distinct feature of grasses.
The earlier assumed general dominance of trimer SSRs in
ESTs was true for only 15 of the 24 analysed plant species.
Dimer SSRs on average were longer and revealed a much
higher variability in length than trimer SSRs. Correlations
of SSR frequencies with the average GC-content could not
be concluded. While the previously reported connection
of a high general GC-content to an increased frequency of
the trimer SSR motif CGG/CCG was valid for four grasses
and Chlamydomonas, this was not true for the alga Mesostigma and the moss Tortula. The earlier assumed general
high abundance of the SSR motif CCG/CCG for monocots
was not true for Allium. Our survey is well suited for a classification of future studies on EST-derived SSRs.

Methods
Plant material
A collection of 21 worldwide Physcomitrella accessions
including the standard laboratory accession 'Gransden'
plus two related Funariaceae, Physcomitrium sphaericum
and Funaria hygrometrica, were selected for analysis (Table
1). The collection includes japanese, australian, african,
european and american accessions [44]. Details of the collection will be presented elsewhere (Mark von Stackelberg
Gabriele Schween, Stefan A. Rensing, Ralf Reski, manuscript in preparation). Plants were grown axenically on
solid media and in liquid culture according to the small
scale cultivation protocol as described [45]. Prior to DNA
extraction, plant material was harvested, shock frozen in
liquid nitrogen and stored at -80Â°C.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/6/9

DNA extraction
The DNA extraction protocol is based on Doyle and Doyle
[46]. Approximately 0.3 g plant material was ground in
liquid nitrogen to a fine powder and incubated in 5 mL
prewarmed CTAB buffer (2% CTAB, 1.4 M NaCl, 20 mM
EDTA, 0.5 % PVP 40, 100 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 0.2 % [v/v]
beta-mercaptoethanol) at 65Â°C for one hour with occasional agitation in a 15 mL polypropylene tube. Afterwards, 5 mL chloroform : isoamylalcohol (24 : 1) was
added. Organic and aqeous phase were vigorously mixed
followed by separation at 2,500 g for 10 minutes. The
aqeous phase was then transferred into a fresh 15 mL
polypropylene tube. RNAse A was added to a final concentration of 100 Âµg/mL and the solution incubated for 30
minutes at 37Â°C. One tenth volume sodium acetate (3 M,
pH 5.2) was added and DNA precipitated overnight with
one volume isopropanol at -20Â°C. DNA was pelleted for
30 min at 2,500 g/4Â°C. The supernatant was decanted and
the pellet incubated in 10 mL washing solution (76 % ethanol, 10 mM ammoniumacetate) for 20 minutes at room
temperature (RT). After a short centrifugation, washing
buffer was decanted and 70 % ethanol added for a 5
minute incubation at room temperature. After a short spin
the supernatant was removed completely and the pellet
air dried at room temperature. DNA was dissolved in 200
ÂµL TE buffer overnight at 4Â°C. The solution was warmed
to 65Â°C for 10 minutes to promote dissolving. DNA quality and concentration was examined by electrophoresis in
0.8 % agarose gels.
Sequence datasets
For a comparative microsatellite analysis, clustered EST
sequence datasets of 24 plant species were chosen (see
Additional file 5). For 18 species we downloaded the
assembled
non-redundant
EST-based
nucleotide
sequence datasets (tentative contigs of the gene indices)
from TIGR [33,34] and for two species each from PlantGDB [35,36] and from NYPG [38-40]. For the moss Physcomitrella patens we used a non-redundant gene index of
the standard lab strain 'Gransden' consisting of high quality, vector-clipped, clustered, assembled and annotated
ESTs available via COSMOSS [9,37]. The same filtering
and assembly procedure as for Physcomitrella was applied
to derive a gene index for all available EST sequences of
the moss Tortula ruralis, also available via COSMOSS. All
applied databases are summarized in See Additional file
5. The percentage of the nucleotides guanin and cytosin
(GC-content) was calculated for the gene indices with the
EMBOSS [47] program GEECEE.
SSR mining software
SSR motifs were detected using the Perl script MISA
[25,26]. The MISA definition of microsatellites was by
unit size (x) and minimum number of repeats (y): 1/100,
2/6, 3/5, 4/5, 5/5, 6/5 (x/y). Mononucleotides were

excluded from further analysis. The maximal number of
interrupting basepairs in a compound microsatellite was
set to 100. MISA detects perfect SSRs only.

value) was calculated according to Botstein et al. [49] as

Analysis of Physcomitrella EST-derived microsatellites
For Physcomitrella patens, MISA was used in direct conjunction with the Primer3 software [27] to derive appropriate
PCR oligonucleotides. The results of the microsatellite
search for Physcomitrella patens are available at COSMOSS
[41]. A maximum of three different primer pairs per SSR
have been provided. Furthermore PCR results for 376 microsatellites, polymorphic SSRs between 'Gransden' and
'Villersexel-K3' and PIC values of 64 SSRs for 21 Physcomitrella accessions have been provided at COSMOSS
[41].

The length of the SSR PCR amplicons was set to 100 â 280
bp. Oligonucleotide parameters for Primer3 were set to a
length of 18 â 27 bp with an optimum of 20 bp, a GC content of 20 â 80 % with an optimum of 50 %, a melting
temperature (Tm) of 57 â 63Â°C with an optimum of
60Â°C, and a primer Tm maximum difference of 1Â°C. SSR
marker were amplified in a 20 ÂµL PCR mix containing 2
ÂµL of 10 Ã RED-Taq-PCR buffer, 0.1 mM dATP, dCTP,
dGTP and dTTP, 5 pmol each of two primers, 0.5 Units
RED-Taq-Polymerase (SIGMA-Aldrich) and 4 ng plant
DNA. Cycling was carried out in a Biometra thermal cycler
T1 starting with an initial DNA denaturation at 95Â°C for
2 min. The first cycle consisted of 30 sec denaturation at
92Â°C, primer annealing for 30 sec at 60Â°C and elongation
for 30 sec at 72Â°C. In each of the 10 subsequent cycles the
annealing temperature was decreased by 0.7Â°C. The final
25 cycles consisted of 15 sec denaturation at 92Â°C, 15 sec
primer annealing at 52Â°C and 30 sec elongation at 72Â°C.
Electrophoretic size separation of SSR PCR products was
performed in 3 % MetaPhor (Cambrex) high resolution
agarose gels in 0.5 fold TBE (45 mM Tris-borate, 1 mM
EDTA, pH 8.0). We thereby circumvented the lengthy and
elaborate use of denaturing polyacrylamide gels. As
described in [48] MetaPhor agarose is capable of resolving
microsatellite size differences of only two basepairs. The
comparably high costs of this agarose can be reduced by
reusing it several times.
SSR-PCR evaluation
SSRs were scored visually in the gel according to their
amplified fragment size. Different sizes of one marker
were scored as different alleles. Same sizes of one SSR and
different sizes which could not be visually distinguished
were scored as the same allele. Repeated abscence of PCR
products in 'Gransden'were scored as PCR failures.
Repeated absence of PCR products in the 20 additional
accessions were scored as null alleles if PCR worked out in
'Gransden'. The polymorphism information content (PIC
