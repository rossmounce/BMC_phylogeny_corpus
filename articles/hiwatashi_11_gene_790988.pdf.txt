Abstract
Background: Routine trichromatic color vision is a characteristic feature of catarrhines (humans, apes and Old
World monkeys). This is enabled by L and M opsin genes arrayed on the X chromosome and an autosomal S opsin
gene. In non-human catarrhines, genetic variation affecting the color vision phenotype is reported to be absent or
rare in both L and M opsin genes, despite the suggestion that gene conversion has homogenized the two genes.
However, nucleotide variation of both introns and exons among catarrhines has only been examined in detail for
the L opsin gene of humans and chimpanzees. In the present study, we examined the nucleotide variation of
gibbon (Catarrhini, Hylobatidae) L and M opsin genes. Specifically, we focused on the 3.6~3.9-kb region that
encompasses the centrally located exon 3 through exon 5, which encode the amino acid sites functional for the
spectral tuning of the genes.
Results: Among 152 individuals representing three genera (Hylobates, Nomascus and Symphalangus), all had both L
and M opsin genes and no L/M hybrid genes. Among 94 individuals subjected to the detailed DNA sequencing,
the nucleotide divergence between L and M opsin genes in the exons was significantly higher than the
divergence in introns in each species. The ratio of the inter-LM divergence to the intra-L/M polymorphism was
significantly lower in the introns than that in synonymous sites. When we reconstructed the phylogenetic tree
using the exon sequences, the L/M gene duplication was placed in the common ancestor of catarrhines, whereas
when intron sequences were used, the gene duplications appeared multiple times in different species. Using the
GENECONV program, we also detected that tracts of gene conversions between L and M opsin genes occurred
mostly within the intron regions.
Conclusions: These results indicate the historical accumulation of gene conversions between L and M opsin genes
in the introns in gibbons. Our study provides further support for the homogenizing role of gene conversion
between the L and M opsin genes and for the purifying selection against such homogenization in the central
exons to maintain the spectral difference between L and M opsins in non-human catarrhines.

Background
In catarrhine primates (humans, apes and Old World
monkeys) the L and M opsin genes are closely juxtaposed on the X chromosome and, in combination with
the autosomal S opsin gene, enable routinely trichromatic color vision [1,2]. The L and M opsin genes have
a close evolutionary relationship and are highly similar
in nucleotide sequence (~96% identity). Among 15

amino acid differences between the human L and M
opsin genes, three account for the main shifts in spectral
sensitivities and tuning [3-9].
The organization of the L and M opsin genes among
humans is known to be variable and includes the absence
of an L or M opsin gene or the presence of L/M hybrid
genes with an intermediate spectral sensitivity. A high
incidence (approximately 3-8%) of color vision “deficiencies” in males results as a consequence [10]. This variation
is caused by unequal meiotic recombination between L
and M opsin genes. When the nucleotide sequence of a
part of one gene appears to be replaced with the

corresponding sequence of the other, this type of recombination is often called gene conversion. Gene conversion is
suggested to have occurred frequently between the human
L and M opsin genes [11-15] and to have played a crucial
role in generating hybrids of the two genes with altered
spectral sensitivities [16-18]. Even among individuals with
normal color vision, the allele frequency of the L opsin
gene with Ala at the site 180 instead of Ser is reported to
be 30-38% in non-African populations [16-18].
Compared to humans, the incidence of color vision
variation is reported to be rare in other catarrhines
[19-21]. Among 744 male long-tailed macaques (Macaca
fascicularis) examined, only three were found to have a
single L/M hybrid gene with an intermediate spectral
sensitivity and to be dichromats [19,22,23]. Among 58
male chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), one was found to
have an L/M hybrid gene with an intermediate spectral
sensitivity in addition to one normal M opsin gene on
the X chromosome and to be a protanomalous trichromat [21,24]. Thus, frequencies of color vision variants in
male long-tailed macaques and male chimpanzees can be
calculated to be ~0.4% and ~1.7%, respectively. These
frequencies could be overestimated because no variants
were found in 455 male monkeys from other macaque
species [19,23] and because the chimpanzees examined
were from limited numbers of breeding colonies [21].
Other studies have reported an absence of color vision
defects in Old World monkeys and apes [20,25].
Nevertheless, gene conversion is suggested to have
occurred frequently between the L and M opsin genes in
non-human catarrhines on the basis of the following
observations: (1) the intraspecific nucleotide divergence
between the L and M opsin genes (paralogous divergence)
tends to be smaller than divergence of the same gene
between species (orthologous divergence) [26,27], (2) allelic polymorphism is often shared between L and M opsin
genes and between species [28,29], (3) paralogous nucleotide divergence in introns and peripheral exons (exons 1
and 6) is significantly smaller than those in the centrally
located exons (exons 2-5), which contain the amino acid
sites affecting absorption spectra of the L and M photopigments [13,14]. These studies suggest that gene conversions
at nucleotide sites relevant for the spectral difference
between the L and M opsins have been effectively eliminated from the population by purifying natural selection.
If gene conversion occurred frequently between the L
and M opsin genes and if purifying selection was active
in non-human catarrhines, we would also expect another
intraspecific pattern of nucleotide variation: higher
nucleotide divergence between the L and M opsin genes
in central exons than in introns in addition to lower
nucleotide diversity within these exons than within
introns. However, the within-species nucleotide variation
of both exons and introns has been evaluated for only the

L opsin gene of two African hominoids, humans [18] and
chimpanzees (primarily P. t. verus) [25]. In the present
study, we focused on gibbons (Family Hylobatidae), commonly known as the lesser apes, for which normal trichromacy is reported [30]. Gibbons occur in Asia and are
the most diverse and speciose of all living apes [31], making them an ideal group with which to assess the range of
L/M opsin genetic variation. We examined the nucleotide
variation of both the L and M opsin genes by sequencing
the 3.6~3.9-kb genomic region encompassing exon 3 to
exon 5 from individuals in five species and three genera
of gibbons.

Methods
Gibbon DNA samples

Blood samples were collected from a total of 157 individuals of the following species: Agile (Hylobates agilis;
N = 37), Kloss’ (H. klossii; N = 2), White-handed (H. lar;
N = 40), Silvery Javan (H. moloch; N = 6), Mueller’s Bornean gray (H. muelleri; N = 6), Pileated (H. pileatus; N =
19), Chinese White-cheeked (Nomascus leucogenys; N =
16) and Siamang (Symphalangus syndactylus; N = 31).
Sampling was conducted at the Ragunan Zoo and the
Pontianak Zoo in Indonesia, and the Chiang Mai Zoo,
the Bangkok Zoo and the Khao Kheow Open Zoo in
Thailand. We also sampled gibbons reared by local residents in Kalimantan, Indonesia. Genomic DNA was
extracted from blood samples using the DNA Microextraction Kit (Stratagene, Santa Clara, CA) or the QIAamp
DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, Duesseldorf, Germany).
Research permissions were granted by each country and
sampling was conducted according to the Guide for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals by the National
Institute of Health, U.S.A. (1985) and the Guide for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Primates by the Primate
Research Institute, Kyoto University (1986, 2002). All
procedures were approved by the animal ethics committee of the Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University.
Among the 157 individuals, 152 were subjected to the
genotyping of the L/M opsin genes (Additional file 1,
Table S1). The remaining 5 individuals (two H. agilis,
one H. lar, and two S. syndactylus) were included in the
analysis of the neutral reference genes. Among the 152
individuals, 94 were subjected to DNA sequencing of the
entire 3.6~3.9-kb region encompassing exon 3 to exon 5
(Table 1).
Genotyping and sequencing of the gibbon L and M opsin
genes

In primates, the L and M opsin genes are arrayed in the
same orientation on the X-chromosome and separated
by approximately 24 kb [32]. Both genes consist of six
exons that encode a protein 364 amino acids long, which
spans approximately 15 kb [1,33,34]. The first (most

upstream) position in the gene array is typically occupied
by the L opsin gene, followed by one or more M opsin
genes downstream [35,36]. However, the long-range
polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) necessary to determine
the position of an L or M opsin gene in the array is not
feasible for a large number of samples due to the paucity
of gene-specific nucleotide sites and of gene-position specific nucleotide sites [21,37-40]. We thus identified a
gene not by the position in the gene array, but rather by
its inferred spectral property.
The peak absorption spectra (lmax) of the catarrhine L
and M opsin photopigments are approximately 560 nm
and 530 nm, respectively [41]. This spectral difference is
mainly attributed to the amino acid differences at three
sites: the residue 180 encoded in the exon 3 and the residues 277 and 285 in the exon 5 [3,4]. Amino acid changes
from Ser to Ala at the site 180, (denoted Ser180Ala),
Tyr277Phe, and Thr285Ala shift the lmax values by -7, -8,
and -15 nm respectively, in nearly an additive manner, and
the reverse amino acid changes cause opposite spectral
shifts by approximately the same extent [5-8]. Therefore,
the contribution of exon 5 to the difference of absorption
spectra between the L and M opsins is greater than that of
exon 3.
Based on the inferred absorption spectra, we defined the
gibbon L opsin gene as having Tyr and Thr and the M
opsin gene as having Phe and Ala at the residues 277 and
285, respectively. This differs slightly from previous studies
in which gene identity is also based on other nucleotide
differences with little or no spectral effects [16]. We
defined the spectral hybrid as having Ala at the reside 180
in the exon 3 of the L opsin gene and as having Ser at the
exon 3 of the M opsin gene.
The average size of the amplified region among the M
opsin sequences was approximately 3.6 kb in each species, while that of the L opsin gene was approximately
3.9, 3.8 and 3.6 kb in the Hylobates species, N. leucogenys and S. syndactylus, respectively. The size difference of the genomic region between the L and M opsin
genes was due to an Alu element in the intron 3 of the
L opsin gene. We isolated this genomic region by two
sets of PCR schemes.

For the first PCR set, we designed an L-specific and an
M-specific reverse primer, Ex5L_Rev (5’- CCCCAGCAGACGCAGTACGCAAAGAT -3’) and Ex5M_Rev (5’CCCCAGCAGAAGCAGAATGCCAGGAC -3’), at a
region including residue 277 and five surrounding nucleotide sites at which the human L (GenBank Accession
number Z68193) and M (GenBank AC092402) opsin
genes differ. This primer site does not contain the residue
285, which is attributable to the relatively few nucleotide
differences reported between L and M immediately downstream of residue 285. Combined with this, a forward primer common to the human L and M opsin genes was set
in intron 2, just upstream of exon 3 (Ex3_For: 5’-GGATCACAGGTCTCTGGTCTCTG-3’). The nucleotide
sequence of exon 3 was then determined for the PCR products using a sequencing primer common to the L and M
opsin genes (Ex3_Rev: 5’-GAGCGTGCAATGTCTATCAA-3’) located in intron 3. The nucleotide differences in
the region used for the gene-specific reverse primers and
in the residue 285 downstream of the primers in the exon
5 were confirmed by a second PCR set.
Our second PCR set was comprised of a reverse primer
common to the human L and M opsin genes. It was
designed in intron 5 just downstream of exon 5 (Ex5_Rev:
5’-GAAATGACCGGGAAAGGCTC-3’). An L- and an Mspecific forward primer were designed in exon 3 at a
region upstream of the site 180, Ex3L_For (5’-TTTCCT
GGGAGAGGTGGCTGGTGGTG-3’) and Ex3M_For (5’TTTCCTGGGAGAGATGGATGGTGGT C-3’), so as to
include three differing nucleotide sites between the published human L and M opsin genes. The nucleotide
sequence of exon 5 was then determined for the PCR product using a common sequencing primer between the L
and M opsin genes (Ex5_For: 5’-CACTCAGGGCTGGAAGATGGC-3’) designed in intron 4. The nucleotide differences in the region used for the gene-specific forward
primers in exon 3 were confirmed by the first PCR set
described above.
By using the combination of these two PCR sets, we
avoided the possible misinterpretation of the presence or
absence of a gene type by false-positive or false-negative
amplification by the gene-specific primers. This is an
improvement from previous studies relying on the success of PCR using gene-specific primers [16,21].
PCRs were carried out in 25 μl containing 1.5 units of
Ex Taq polymerase hot start version (Takara, Tokyo)
with 1× Ex Taq Buffer, 0.2 mM each of dNTPs, 1 μM
each of the forward and reverse primers, and ca. 5 ng of
the gibbon genomic DNA at 94°C for 10 min followed by
35 cycles at 94°C for 30 sec, 65°C for 30 sec, and 72°C for
4 min. Distilled water was used as the template for the
negative control in every reaction. The amplification was
confirmed by 0.5% agarose-gel electrophoresis and the

Hiwatashi et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:312

amplified DNA fragments were purified using the Montage PCR Centrifugal Filter Device (Millipore, Tokyo).
Pruified DNA samples were directly sequenced using
Applied Biosystems model 3130 automatic sequencer with
Big Dye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied
Biosystems Japan, Tokyo) and sequencing primers
(Ex3_Rev, Ex5_For and other primers set inside the amplified region). Operationally, we first sequenced the L and
M opsin genes of both DNA strands from a sample of a
male as only one X-chromosome is present. We
sequenced only one strand for other samples if there was
no nucleotide difference from the ones for which both
strands were sequenced. When we found nucleotide differences in two or more individuals at the same site, we
sequenced both strands of at least one of the samples to
confirm the variation. When we found a different nucleotide in only one sample, i.e. as a singleton among the samples, we repeated the PCR for the sample and sequenced
the region for both strands to rule out a PCR error and to
confirm the variation.
When a sample from a male showed two nucleotide
peaks at one or more sites (“heterozygous” sites) in the L
or M opsin gene, the individual should have two or more
loci of the gene with different sequences. In this case, we
conservatively inferred two loci for this gene. When a
female showed heterozygous sites, the individual could
have allelic differences or two or more copies of the gene.
We regarded such females as having one locus with different alleles for this opsin type because this arrangement
gives the minimum possible and the most conservative
estimate of the number of sequences. Thus, the sequence
number could be underrepresented in our results and one
gene group (i.e. the L or M opsin group) does not necessarily consist of orthologous members. When we confined
an analysis to the orthologous gene groups, we used only
male samples with single L and M opsin genes.
We did not attempt to separate the sequences by DNA
cloning. In the alignment of the nucleotide sequences
(Additional files 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6), we treated these
sequences as two alternate gene sequences and arbitrarily
assigned the nucleotides at the heterozygous sites into
the two sequences. For calculations of the nucleotide
diversity within a gene group and the nucleotide divergence between gene groups (see below for details), the
nucleotide combination at the heterozygous sites (haplotype) is not necessary. When we conducted an analysis
requiring the haplotype information, such as the GENECONV procedure (described below) or the evaluation of
linkage disequilibrium, we used only male samples with
single L and M opsin genes.
Nucleotide sequencing of the neutral reference regions

The eta-globin gene is suitable as a neutral reference
because it is a single copy pseudogene well characterized

for primates [42] and the ortholog for a gibbon (H. lar)
has been reported (GenBank M54985) [43]. A pair of
PCR primers was designed according to the gibbon
sequence to amplify ca. 0.5 kb in the 5’-flanking region
that is free of repeat sequences: forward, 5’-AGAGGAGAAGTAAAAAGCCAC-3’; reverse, 5’-ACATAACTCTCAAAATCCCAC-3’. The S opsin gene intron 4 was also
used as a neutral reference. A pair of PCR primers was
designed according to the human S opsin sequence (GenBank L32835) to amplify ca. 0.5 kb that is free of repeat
sequences: forward, 5’-CCCTGCCAACTTTTAGCTTGCAC-3’; reverse, 5’-TTCCCGCACCATCTCCATGAT-3’.
The PCRs were carried out with the same composition
of the reaction mixture as used for the L/M opsin gene.
Purification and sequencing were carried out as previously
described for the L/M opsin gene. As was the case with
the L/M opsin gene, we did not clone the neutral references and thus the two allelic DNA sequences of individuals were not separated. In the alignment (Additional
files 7, 8), two heterozygous alleles were tentatively sorted
into two allele sequences.
In each of the five gibbon species, the nucleotide
sequences of the L and M opsin genes from one male
sample with single L and M opsin genes have been deposited to the GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ database. The nucleotide sequences of the eta-globin 5’ flanking and the S
opsin intron 4 sequences were also deposited to the database from one individual each from the five species who
had no heterozygous sites. Their sequence ID in this study
(see also Additional files 2, 7, 8) and the accession numbers in the database are listed in Table 2.
Data analysis

Alignment of the nucleotide sequences was conducted
using the Clustal W software [44] and was adjusted
manually. The average number of between-group nucleotide differences per nucleotide site was designated the
nucleotide divergence (d). The d value between the L and
M opsin genes within a species was calculated by eliminating all positions containing gaps from the alignment.
The average number of within-group nucleotide differences per nucleotide site between two sequences was
designated the nucleotide diversity (π) and was calculated
by eliminating all positions containing gaps from the
alignment. The average numbers of between- and withingroup synonymous differences per synonymous site and
non-synonymous differences per non-synonymous site
were calculated using the Nei-Gojobori method [45]. We
connected the alignments of the eta-globin pseudogene
and the S opsin gene intron 4 to calculate the π value of
the combined neutral references for the individuals for
which both genes were sequenced. The standard errors
of the π and d values including those of their synonymous and non-synonymous components were estimated

For testing gene conversion, we applied the GENECONV 1.81 program [50] implementing Sawyer’s statistical method [51]. GENECONV searches for a consecutively
identical region between two sequences and evaluates the
probability of achieving homogeneity when nucleotide differences are assumed to be randomly distributed throughout the sequence region.

by a bootstrap procedure (1000 replicates). All of these
computations were conducted using MEGA version 5
[46]. The statistical significance of the difference between
two d value or two π values was evaluated by the onetailed Z test.
For constructing an among-group phylogenetic tree,
we corrected the d values for multiple substitutions by
the Jukes-Cantor formula [47] and used the neighborjoining method [48] by eliminating all positions containing gaps from the alignment. The exon and intron
sequences of a human L (GenBank Z68193) and M
(GenBank AC092402) opsin genes and the exon
sequence of a crab-eating macaque L (GenBank
AF158968) and M (GenBank AF158975) opsin genes
[23] were also included as well as the exon sequence of
a mouse M opsin gene (GenBank AF011389) as an outgroup. In the case of the human, macaque and mouse
sequences, one gene sequence was regarded as one
group. The reliability of the topology of the phylogenetic
tree was evaluated by bootstrap resampling (1000x)
using the “sendbs2” program [49]. To compute the
bootstrap values, the human, macaque and mouse
sequences were input twice in the alignment because
the sendbs2 does not accept one sequence as one group.

L/M opsin genotyping

On the basis of the amino acid composition at site 180
encoded in the exon 3 and 277 and 285 encoded in exon
5, the L/M opsin genotype was determined for 152 individuals of gibbons from the eight species (Additional file 1,
Table S1). All individuals had standard L and M opsin
genes. No L/M hybrid genes were found in terms of the
three-site composition.
Multiple M opsin copies

The nucleotide variation was analyzed for five species,
H. agilis, H. lar, H. pileatus, N. leucogenys and S. syndactylus for the genomic region encompassing the exon 3
through the exon 5, approximately 3.6~3.9 kb. We
excluded H. klossii, H. moloch and H. muelleri from the
subsequent analysis because of their small sample size. A
total of 94 individuals including 51 males were subjected
for the analysis (Table 1). Among the males, there were no
individuals detected that had multiple L opsin genes. On
the other hand, multiple M opsin genes were detected in
80.0% of N. leucogenys, 28.6% of H. lar, 16.7% of H. agilis,
and 10.0% of H. pileatus and S. syndactylus males.
Nucleotide divergence between L and M opsin genes
within species

Figure 1 summarizes the nucleotide divergence between
the L and M opsin genes in the exons and introns in the
five gibbon species (Additional file 1, Table S2 for the
values). Exons were generally more divergent than introns.
In particular, the divergence of exons 3 and 5 was significantly higher than that in the introns. Within the exons,
however, non-synonymous divergence was lower or not
significantly higher than synonymous divergence in any
of the three exons in all five species (Additional file 1,
Table S3). Both synonymous and non-synonymous divergences of exons were significantly larger than the intron
divergence in all five species (Figure 1).
We also examined male samples with a single M as
well as a single L opsin sequence types. There were ten
H. agilis, ten H. lar, nine H. pileatus, one N. leucogenys,
and nine S. syndactylus males that had single L and M
opsin genes. We excluded the one N. leucogenys from the
calculation because of its inapplicability to the population
analysis. As shown in Additional file 1, Figure S1, the pattern of nucleotide divergence between the L and M opsin

genes in the exons and introns in these individuals was
essentially the same as the pattern shown in Figure 1.

Nucleotide diversity of L and M opsin genes within
species

Figure 2 summarizes the nucleotide diversity of the L
and M opsin exons and introns and of the neutral references (see Additional file 1, Tables S4 and S5 for the
values). As for the neutral references, we also incorporated the nucleotide diversity reported by Kim et al
(2011) [52] for the30~75 kb of autosomal regions and
the 2~13 kb of X chromosomal regions of these gibbon
species. In Figure 2, the nucleotide diversity values of
the autosomal neutral references are adjusted (multiplied by 3/4) for comparison with X-chromosomal L/M
opsin genes (see Discussion).
In both the L and M opsin genes, contrary to the case
with the nucleotide divergence, the nucleotide diversity
of the exons was lower overall than that of the introns
and in many cases was even zero (Additional file 1, Table
S4). Alternatively, introns were as variable as the neutral
references (Figure 2). When the three exons and the two
introns were combined respectively, the exons were significantly less variable than the introns (Figure 2). When
using only males with single L and M opsin genes, the
pattern of nucleotide diversity of L and M opsin genes
(Additional file 1, Figure S2) was also the same with that
shown in Figure 2.
Within the exons, variation consisted mainly of synonymous variation (Additional file 1, Figure S3 and Table
S6). The synonymous variation was as high as, or lower
than, the intron variation. However, the synonymous variation showed a large stochastic error compared to the
nucleotide diversity in the introns (Figure S3) and the
synonymous nucleotide divergence (Figure 1). This is
because of the much smaller number of the synonymous
nucleotide sites (137~138 bp) in the coding region than in
the total length of the introns (3.0~3.3 kb) and the lower
level of synonymous nucleotide diversity (0~0.4%) than
the synonymous divergence between the L and M opsin
genes (6.1~6.4%).
Comparison of inter-LM divergence and intra-L/M
polymorphism between synonymous sites and introns

Using the male samples with single L and M opsin genes,
we counted the number of sites fixed with different
nucleotides between the L and M opsin genes (inter-LM
divergence) and the number of polymorphic nucleotide
sites in the L, M or both genes within a species (intra-L/
M polymorphism). We then categorized these sites into
non-synonymous and synonymous sites in the exons and
intron sites. As shown in Table 3, the relative amount of
divergence to polymorphism was significantly smaller in
introns than in exon synonymous sites in all of the four
species examined (P<0.02, Fisher’s exact test). On the
other hand, between non-synonymous and synonymous
sites within exons, there was no significant difference

on the nucleotide divergence between the groups (Figure 3A). The L and M opsin genes were separated at
the common ancestor of the human, gibbons and macaque. In contrast, when the two introns were combined
and an among-group phylogenetic tree was constructed
for gibbons and human, the L and M opsin groups were
clustered in N. leucogenys, S. syndactylus, human, and in
the genus Hylobates (Figure 3B). In both the exon and
intron trees, Nomascus was placed at the most basal
position among the gibbons (Figure 3), being consistent
with the current knowledge of the gibbon molecular
phylogeny [53-57].
Test of gene conversion by GENECONV

For the GENECONV analysis we considered only male
samples including the one N. leucogenys sample with single L and M opsin genes. We detected tracts of the gene
conversion in each of the five species predominantly in
intron regions with the global P values of less than 0.05
based on permutations for the entire alignment of the
78 sequences and corrected for multiple comparisons
(Figure 4).

Discussion
In the present study we examined intraspecific genetic
variation of gibbon L and M opsin genes. This study also
enabled comparison of the intraspecific nucleotide diversity between the L/M opsin gene regions and other autosomal regions as neutral references. In theory, when
mutations are selectively neutral and population size is
constant through generations, the nucleotide diversity is
expected to be equal to the population mutation rate

genes of diploid organisms, where N e is the effective
population size and μ is the mutation rate per nucleotide
site per chromosome per generation) [58]. The nucleotide diversity of the gibbon neutral references was in the
range of 0.10~0.41% (0.28% on average) when the two
references were combined (Additional file 1, Table S5).
These values are comparable to the nucleotide diversity
of gibbon genomes recently reported by Kim et al. (2011)
[52]; 0.16~0.29% (0.25% on average) in the autosomal
regions and 0.04~0.18% (0.11% on average) in the X
chromosomal regions of the same five species examined
in this study (Figure 2 and Additional file 1, Table S5).
Consistent with Kim et al. (2011) [52], they are also
higher overall than reported nucleotide diversity of autosomal genes in humans (0.12%), chimpanzees (0.19%),
bonobos (0.10%) and gorillas (0.15%) and are comparable
with that in orangutans (0.36%) [59-61], suggesting a
generally larger N e in Asian apes than in African apes.
Although, our samples were collected from zoos and privately owned animals, the consistency with the large genome data set [52] implies that these samples could fairly
represent the diversity of a natural population. The high
nucleotide diversity of the reference genes also safely precludes the possibility that our samples are biased to a
close kin group.
All 152 individuals from the eight species examined
had both of the normal L and M opsin genes. Based on
the composition of the three amino acid sites relevant to
absorption spectra, there was no L/M hybrid gene
detected with an intermediate spectral sensitivity. This
observation is consistent with previous studies on the
genetic variation of the L and M opsin genes in nonhuman catarrhines reporting no or rare observation of
the gene deletion or the hybrid genes [19-21].
Ninety four individuals from five species, including 51
males, were subjected to sequencing of the 3.6~3.9-kb
region encompassing exon 3 through exon 5. Among
them, plural M opsin genes were detected in 10-80% of

males in each species (23.5% of all males). Only a single L
opsin sequence was detected in all males. Although more
data are desired, these results are comparable to humans
where multiple M copies are found in 66% of males of
European origin [11] and 56% of Japanese males [62] and
more than one L copy is rarely found [63]. Regarding
non-human catarrhines, studies concur that a single L
opsin copy is generally found in the genomes whereas
some studies report that multiple M copies are rare
[19,21,23,25] yet other studies report that they are common [26,29]. Thus, among Old World monkeys and apes,
there seems to be no clear trend on the copy number variation of M opsin gene. There also seems to be no clear
correlation between the frequency of X chromosomes
carrying multiple copies of the M opsin gene with and
the frequency of L or M opsin gene deletion or the
hybridization.
In this study, we defined the L and M opsin genes on
the basis of their deduced amino acid composition at residues 277 and 285 and not on the basis of their position in
the L/M opsin gene array on the chromosome. As
explained in the Methods, the sequence numbers of the L
and M opsin gene groups could be underrepresented and
the nucleotide diversity and divergence values for the gene
groups could therefore be overestimated. Conceptually,
the gene group in this study does not necessarily correspond to the “orthologous” group because it allows inclusion of duplicated copies. Nevertheless, when we only
included the male samples with single L and M opsin
genes to confine the analysis to the orthologous gene
groups, the pattern of nucleotide divergence and diversity
was indistinguishable from that where all samples were
used (compare Figure 1 with Additional file 1, Figure S1,
and Figure 2 with Additional file 1, Figure S2). Thus, there
appears to be little or no distortion made in the pattern of
nucleotide diversity and divergence by our collective treatment of the gene groups.
The within-species nucleotide divergence between L and
M opsin genes was significantly higher in the exons than
in the introns (Figure 1 and Additional file 1, Figure S1
and Table S2). This is opposite to what is expected for the
general pattern of divergence: i.e. the protein-coding exons
are generally more conservative than introns. Within the
exons, however, non-synonymous divergence was not significantly higher than synonymous divergence in any of
the three exons in the five species (Figure 1 and Additional
file 1, Figure S1 and Table S3). This is an orthodox pattern
of nucleotide divergence in coding regions under a functional constraint [64]. It is hence unlikely that the higher
divergence in exons than in introns is due to divergent
natural selection between the two genes acting on the
amino acid sequence. The intron divergence was significantly lower than both of the synonymous and non-synonymous divergences in all of the five species (Figure 1 and

Hiwatashi et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:312
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/312

Additional file 1, Figure S1). The low divergence in introns
is likely due to a homogenizing process operating between
the two genes, i.e. gene conversion, and the purifying
selection against the gene conversion in the exons.
Contrary to the pattern of nucleotide divergence, in both
L and M opsin genes the within-species nucleotide diversity was lower overall in exons than in introns (Figure 2
and Additional file 1, Figure S2 and Table S4). Within the
exons, the variation was largely synonymous (Figure S3
and Additional file 1, Table S6). This is a typical pattern of
nucleotide variation in protein-coding exons and introns.
The nucleotide diversity of the introns was about the same
magnitude with the nucleotide diversity of the autosomal
neutral references multiplied by 3/4 and that of the Xchromosomal references in each species (Figure 2 and
Additional file 1, Figure S2 and Table S5). Therefore, gene
conversion in the introns does not seem to affect the
nucleotide diversity, possibly because the numbers of
introduced and erased mutations by the gene conversion
are canceled out.
The contrasting pattern of the nucleotide divergence
and diversity between exons and introns was further manifested by comparing the relative amount of the inter-LM
divergence to the intra-L/M polymorphism between the
synonymous sites and the introns. The ratio in the introns
was significantly lower than that in the synonymous sites
(Table 3). Since the synonymous sites and introns are both
expected to be under selective neutrality, this pattern is
consistent with the homogenization between the L and M
opsin genes by gene conversion in introns. Within the
exons, the ratio was not significantly different between
synonymous and non-synonymous sites: in both nucleotide divergence and diversity the synonymous variation
was generally larger than the non-synonymous variation
(Figure 1 and Additional file 1, Figures S1 and S3). This
suggests that the non-synonymous sites are under selective
constraint and the non-synonymous differences between
the two genes are protected by purifying selection in conjunction with neighboring synonymous differences from
the homogenization by exon gene conversions.
The among-group phylogenetic tree for the L and M
opsin genes showed a contrasting cluster pattern between
cases using exon versus intron regions (Figure 3). In the
exon tree, gene duplication appears to have occurred once
in the common ancestor of hominoids (gibbons and
human) and Old World monkeys (crab-eating macaque)
(Figure 3A), whereas in the intron tree, gene duplication
appears to have occurred independently in N. leucogenys,
S. syndactylus, a common ancestor of the Hylobates species, and humans (Figure 3B). If the phylogenetic representation of the exon tree reflects the true relationships
among the gene groups, the topology of the intron tree
can be explained by the gene conversion between the
duplicated L and M opsin genes at the individual level and

Page 10 of 14

by natural selection against the gene conversion involving
exons at the population level. On the other hand, if the
intron tree reflects the true relationships, the topology of
the exon tree is inexplicable.
Tracts of gene conversions were assessed by the GENECONV statistical method (Figure 4). This method
assesses whether the nucleotide differences found
between two sequences are randomly distributed along
the length of these sequences; it cannot detect gene conversions if a given region has fewer differences than its
flanking regions. It has been advised that other methods,
such as phylogenetic trees, have to be used to identify
gene conversions (e.g. see [65]). Our GENECONV result
is regarded consistent with the other results since the
detected gene conversions were located mostly in the
intron areas (Figure 4). In S. syndactylus, the detected
gene conversion included the most part of the exon 4
(Figure 4). Considering that exon 4 contributes much
less to the spectral difference between the L and M
opsins than the exons 3 and 5 [5] and that the nucleotide
divergence between the L and M opsin genes in the exon
4 is smaller than those in the exons 3 and 5 (Figure 1 and
Additional file 1, Figure S1), the GENECONV result suggest that the purifying selection against gene conversion
is weaker in the exons 4 than in the exons 3 and 5.
Throughout this study, we found no signature of positive (either directional or balancing) selection acting on
the gibbon L and M opsin genes. As shown in Figure 1
and Additional file 1, Figure S1, the nucleotide divergence
between the L and M opsin genes at non-synonymous
sites was always smaller than that at synonymous sites.
The nucleotide divergence between species for the L opsin
genes or the M opsin genes at non-synonymous sites was
also smaller or not significantly higher than that at synonymous sites (data not presented). Using the male samples
with single L and M opsin genes (i.e. the “orthologous”
sequence groups of the L and M opsin genes) of H. agilis,
H. lar, H. pileatus and S. syndactylus, we detected no significant difference in the relative amount of the inter-specific divergence to the intra-specific polymorphism
between synonymous and non-synonymous sites in either
the L or M opsin gene (the McDonald-Kreitman test [66])
or between the L or M opsin gene and the neutral references (the HKA test [67]) (data not presented). Using
these male samples, we did not find any characteristic haplotype structure in terms of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in
the approximately 3.6~3.9-kb genomic region of the L and
M opsin genes as was not found in a study of chimpanzee
L opsin gene [25]. A measure of LD, the D’, which takes a
range from 0 to 1 [58], was nearly 1 throughout the region
in all the four species examined (data not presented). This
indicates low incidence of recombination between alleles,
which is not unusual within such a short region. While
the high LD could simply result from a small sample size,

Hiwatashi et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:312
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/312

it is not contradictory with the frequent incidence of the
gene conversion between gene loci because the LD concerns recombination between alleles.
The present study of within-species nucleotide variation of both the L and M opsin genes in gibbons provides
additional support to previous studies suggesting that the
gene conversion has homogenized the tandemly duplicated L and M opsin genes and their spectral difference
is maintained by purifying selection on centrally-located
exons in non-human catarrhines [13,14,26-29]. The strict
conservation of trichromacy in non-human catarrhines
underscores a general belief that trichromacy is selectively more advantageous than dichromacy or anomalous
trichromacy. Primate trichromacy is hypothesized to be
adaptive for detecting anything differing from the background foliage in red-green coloration, the proposed
major objects being mature fruits, young leaves, pelage
and skin [68-79].
The strict conservation of the trichromacy in nonhuman catarrhines is in sharp contrast to New World
monkeys. In many species of New World monkeys, the
spectral variation of the L/M opsin is achieved by an allelic
differentiation of a single locus on the X chromosome.
This results in polymorphic color vision, consisting of trichromacy in females and dichromacy in both sexes [80].
Genetic studies have shown that the allelic difference has
been maintained by balancing selection [81-83]. It remains
to be elucidated whether the polymorphic color vision is a
consequence of selective advantage on trichromats
through the overdominance of the L/M opsin heterozygotes or the consequence of other mechanisms of balancing selection including a mutual benefit among different
vision types [83,84]. It has been demonstrated that dichromats are superior to trichromats in some visual tasks such
as defeating cryptic coloration and motion detection
[70,85,86] and have a foraging advantage for surface-dwelling insects [87-89]. In non-human catarrhines, however,
this benefit of dichromacy could have been overwhelmed
by that of trichromacy. It is still an open question whether
the difference between the non-human catarrhines (routine trichromacy) and New World monkeys (polymorphic
color vision) is attributable to a phenological difference
among continents, such as in severity of seasonality and
availability of non-colorful and non-seasonal fig and palms
[90], to a dietary variation such as in dependency on insets
or colorful fruits, or to variation of social color signals
[78,79].
The absence of L/M defects in gibbons and other nonhuman catarrhines reveals the uniqueness of human
color vision, in which the deletion of L or M opsin genes
and the presence of L/M hybrid genes causes relatively
high incidence of dichromacy and anomalous trichromacy [18,91-94]. Color vision polymorphisms among
humans could be explained by frequent gene conversions

Page 11 of 14

of exon 3, due to the presence of a recombination hotspot chi element conserved in the exon [17] and relaxation of the selective constraint to maintain the spectral
difference between the L and M opsin genes. Alternatively, adaptive explanations are possible. Balancing selection may be acting on subtle changes in light absorption
of L [18] and M opsins among females, or a selective
advantage could be experienced by dichromatic males
during hunting activities or via an increased ability to
detect predators via penetrating camouflage [85]. Further
population studies of the L/M opsin genes for terrestrialsavanna catarrhines, such as baboons, would be important for elucidating evolutionary forces acting on development and maintenance of primate trichromacy.

Conclusions
The present study of within-species nucleotide variation of
the L and M opsin genes in gibbons supports the notion
that gene conversion has homogenized the tandemly
duplicated L and M opsin genes and that their spectral difference is maintained by the purifying selection on the
centrally-located exons in non-human catarrhines. Growing knowledge on genetic variation of opsin genes and
visual ecology of primates has led to a paradigm shift
toward the view that the adaptive value of trichromacy is
conditional rather than universal, depending on the specific ecological demands on animals in their environments.
Further population genetic and molecular phylogenic studies of primate visual opsins including humans, as well as
observation and experiments on vision-guided primate
behaviors, and phenological studies of habitats of wild primates will elucidate the detailed conditions of color vision
evolution in primates.
