Abstract
Background: Molecular phylogenetic analyses have identified Trimeniaceae, a monotypic family
distributed only in Oceania, as among the earliest diverging families of extant angiosperms.
Therefore, the fossils of this family are helpful to understand the earliest flowering plants.
Paleobotanical information is also important to track the historical and geographical pathways to
endemism of the Trimeniaceae. However, fossils of the family were previously unknown from the
Early Cretaceous, the time when the angiosperm radiated. In this study, we report a seed from the
late Albian (ca. 100 million years ago) of Japan representing the oldest known occurrence of
Trimeniaceae and discuss the character evolution and biogeography of this family.
Results: A structurally preserved seed was collected from the early Late Albian Hikagenosawa
Formation of the Yezo Group, which was deposited in palaeolatitudes of 35 to 40°N. The seed has
a multilayered stony exotesta with alveolate surface, parenchymatous mesotesta, and operculate
inner integument, which are characteristic to extant trimeniaceous seeds. However, the seed
differs from extant seeds, i.e., in its well-developed endosperm and absence of antiraphal vascular
bundle. Thus, the seed would be a new genus and species of Trimeniaceae.
Conclusion: The fossil seed indicates that seed coat characters were conserved for 100 million
years or more in Trimeniaceae. It also suggests that the antiraphal vascular bundle and perispermy
originated secondarily in Trimeniaceae as previously inferred from the phylogeny and character
distribution in the extant basalmost angiosperms. The fossil seed provides the first evidence that
Trimeniaceae was distributed in a midlatitude location of the Northern Hemisphere during the
Early Cretaceous, when angiosperms radiated extensively, supporting a hypothesis that the extant
austral distribution is relict.

Background
Trimeniaceae is a small family consisting of only the
genus Trimenia, with eight species known from Celebes to
eastern Australia and the southwest Pacific [1,2]. Trimenia
consists of shrubs and lianas that have unisexual or bisexual flowers with numerous tepals and stamens and a single carpel [1-4]. A solitary pendant ovule is enclosed in the
ovary and develops into a seed with a stony seed coat contained in a berry [1,4-7]. The family was placed in the Laurales based on floral structures, such as the single carpel
and ovule per flower [3,4], but molecular phylogenetic
studies have identified it as one of the earliest diverging
families of extant angiosperms, along with the Amborellaceae, Nymphaeales [Cabombaceae and Nymphaeaceae], Hydatellaceae, Austrobaileyaceae, and Illiciaceae
[8-11]. Thus, clarifying the primitive character states of
Trimeniaceae would be helpful in understanding the earliest flowers. In particular, information on key innovations of angiosperms, for example, fruit, bitegmic seeds,
and endosperm, would provide clues to solving the origin
of angiosperms, a central mystery of plant evolution
[12,13].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/135

reproductive structures, such as flowers, fruits, and seeds,
are needed to confirm the past existence of the Trimeniaceae in the Northern Hemisphere.
We report the oldest seed of Trimeniaceae from the Early
Cretaceous Yezo Group in Hokkaido, northern Japan, and
discuss character evolution and biogeography of the Trimeniaceae.
Geological settings and other paleobotanical data of
collection site
A structurally preserved seed was found within a calcareous siltstone nodule collected at Pombetsu, Mikasa City,
Hokkaido, Japan (Figure 1). The Hikagenosawa Formation of the Yezo Group outcrops in the area and contains
ammonoids indicating a date in the early Late Albian
[30,31]. Palaeomagnetic studies show that these sediments were deposited in palaeolatitudes of 35 to 40°N
and that the sedimentary basin was located on the eastern
side of Laurasia [30,32]. Because the formation mainly
consists of offshore sediments, there are few palaeobotanical records within it [33-35], but a subtropical climate

Great efforts have been made to find evidence of early
angiosperms from the Early to mid-Cretaceous, when the
angiosperms radiated extensively [14-20]. The early emergence of Nymphaeales [18,21] and Illiciaceae [16] in the
fossil record partly supports the phylogenetic framework
inferred from molecular data. However, direct evidence
that the other earliest diverging families emerged in the
early phase of angiosperm radiation [20] has not been
found, although paleobotanical records [16,18], as well as
phylogeny [8-11], imply that these families should have
diverged by the mid-Cretaceous [22].
From the austral distribution of Trimeniaceae, and the
similar distribution of Amborellaceae and Austrobaileyaceae [1], neobotanists have inferred the Gondwana origin of these families [23,24], but accumulated
palynological data have indicated that a different explanation is needed for this distribution. These data indicate
that angiosperms originated in low paleolatitudes (20°N
to 20°S) no later than the Hauterivian, Early Cretaceous,
about 132 million years ago [25,26] and spread toward
the poles over time [26-28]. Pollen records provide temporal and spatial distribution patterns of angiosperms,
with the implication that the Trimeniaceae could have
migrated to Laurasia, a continental mass in the Northern
Hemisphere. However, pollen is difficult to assign to
extant families due to the frequent convergent evolution
of pollen morphology, such as the number and position
of apertures [20,29]. Moreover, extant Trimenia pollens
are eurypalynos with regard to the number of aperture
even in a same species [29], obscuring diagnostic pollen
characters in familiar level. Thus, findings from other

with dry seasons seems to have prevailed in the area, as
suggested by the occurrence of a cheirolepidiaceous conifer [34] and a variety of ephedroid palynomorphs [33].

Results
The seed is ellipsoid, 3 mm long and 2.2 mm thick. It has
an inner integument and an outer seed coat (testa) (Figures 2a,c,e). The micropyle is formed by both inner integument and testa (endostome and exostome, respectively)
and adjacent to the hilum, which contains tracheids and
sclerenchymatous fibers, i.e., the seed is anatropous (Figures 2e,f). These tracheids and fibers are found only in sections through the raphal side, thus the vascular bundle
does not extend to the antiraphal side beyond the chalaza
(Figure 2e). The inner integument is almost crushed,
except in the endostomic region, where the inner integument is thickened to form the operculum (Figures 2c,f).
The testa consists of an outer (exotesta) and inner (mesotesta) part. The exotesta comprises one to five layers of isodiametric cells, while the mesotesta is made up of four to
five layers of longitudinally elongated cells. The exotesta is
lignified to give mechanical strength to the seed coat (Figure 2c). In a nearly tangential section through the seed
surface, there are polygonal openings in the exotesta, indicating the presence of polygonal areoles on the exotestal
surface (asterisks in Figure 2h). This configuration was
further examined by reconstructing a three-dimensional
image of the seed surface by compiling serial peel sections, revealing that the exotestal surface is alveolate (Figure 2k). Inside the inner integument are three
membranous structures. The outermost structure, connected to the chalaza, is the nucellar epidermis (Figure 2a
and arrowheads in Figures 2c,g). The innermost structure
is observed only in sections through the center of the seed
and encircles an area 200 μm in length and 40 μm in
width (arrowhead 3 in Figure 2g).

Discussion
Relationships of the fossil seed
Although seed structures have not been examined in all
Trimenia species, available information on four species (T.
moorei, T. neocaledonica, T. papuana, and T. weinmanniifolia) suggests that Trimeniaceae is uniform family in regard
of ovule and seed structures [1,4-7]. The seed of extant Trimenia is characterized by the testa, consisting of a lignified
multilayered exotesta with an alveolate surface and a nonlignified multilayered mesotesta (Figures 2b,d,i,j) [1,4,7].
Although many families possess seed coats with a hardened exotesta, none other than Trimeniaceae is known to
possess a multilayered exotesta [1,4,7,36]. The seeds of
some taxa are similar in appearance to the Trimeniaceae
seed in that the testa consists of outer sclerotic and inner
non-sclerotic cell layers. These taxa include the genus
Nuphar (Nymphaeaceae) [37,38], the families Buxaceae
[36], Simmondsiaceae [39], Melianthaceae [40], Myrta-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/135

ceae [36,41], and Theaceae [36], and the order Sapindales
[36,42]. However, in these taxa, the stony outer layer is
composed of a single-layered columnar exotesta and the
outer part of the isodiametric mesotestal cells, whereas the
exotesta of Trimenia is composed uniformly of sclerotic
isodiametric cells, which are derivatives of the outer epidermis of the outer integument [7]. Thus, to our knowledge, no other seeds can be compared to the fossil seed.
The fossil seed is not distinguishable from that of extant
Trimenia in terms of shape, size, anatropy, bitegmy, endo
and exostomic micropyle, crushed inner integument with
an operculum, lignified multilayered exotesta composed
of isodiametric cells, alveolate surface of the exotesta, or
nonlignified multilayered mesotesta (Figure 2). These
remarkable similarities unequivocally indicate the close
affinity of the fossil seed to the Trimeniaceae. The fossil
seed differs from Trimenia seed in the absence of antiraphal vascular bundle (Figure 2e) and in the size of membranous structures surrounding the nucellus (Figures 2c,g; see
below for details). Thus, a new genus of Trimeniaceae
should be assigned to the fossil seed. The seed also differs
from Trimenia seed in having a stalklike structure at the
nucellar base (Figure 2a). This stalklike structure might
represent a diagnostic feature of the seed, but the structure
could be artificially formed by shrinkage.
Divergence time of Trimeniaceae
Molecular phylogeny indicates that the Trimeniaceae
diverged after the Nymphaeales and before the Illiciaceae
[8-11]. Thus, diversification of the Trimeniaceae in the
Early to earliest Late Cretaceous (from 125 to 90 million
years ago) is indicated [22] by the Late Barremian flower
of the Nymphaeales from Portugal [18] and the Cenomanian to Turonian seeds of the Illiciaceae from Kazakhstan
[16]. Although Trimeniaceae-like triporate or polyforate
pollen was collected in the Albian to Cenomanian of Brazil [43,44], the Barremian of Portugal [15,17] and the
Campanian to Maastrichitian (83–65 million years ago)
of Australia and Antarctica [44,45], the possibility could
not be ruled out that these are assigned to other families
[20,29,44,46]. Longstrethia varidentata, a foliar species
reported from the Cenomanian of Nebraska, is similar to
leaves of Trimeniaceae in presence of an intermarginal
vein, but L. varidentata would represent a stem-group
taxon of Trimeniaceae-Illiciaceae clade because some
characters are also shared with Illiciaceae [47]. Therefore,
no unequivocal record of Trimeniaceae in the Cretaceous
existed. The fossil seed provides the first unequivocal evidence of Trimeniaceae 100 million years ago that fills the
gap between molecular data and paleobotanical records.
Character evolution in Trimeniaceae
The fossil seed coat structures are strikingly similar to
those of Trimenia (Figure 2). Although these characters

were acquired 100 million or more years ago and are conserved in Trimeniaceae, the mode of nutrient storage of
the fossil seed would have differed considerably from that
of the extant Trimenia. The Trimenia embryo is enclosed by
the endosperm, which is further surrounded by the peris-

perm, an additional storage tissue (Figures 2d,i) [4,6,7].
However, the fossil seed has two membranous structures
inside the nucellus, and the area encircled by the inner
structure corresponds in size to the dormant mature
embryo of extant Trimeniaceae (Figures 2g,i). If this com-

parison is correct, the outer structure may be comparable
to the endosperm membrane. In albuminous seeds without a perisperm, the epidermis of the nucellus is either
completely disintegrated by the enlarged endosperm or
vestigially retained as a crushed layer, whereas in perispermous seeds, it is retained as the epidermis of the perisperm [6,7,36]. The fossil has a relatively well preserved
nucellar epidermis, which may imply the presence of a
perisperm. The putative endosperm in the fossil occupies
a large area inside the nucellus, and thus the endosperm
would have played a major storage role. Among the earliest families to diverge, only Nymphaeales [38], Hydatellaceae [48], and Trimeniaceae [4,6,7] have a diploid
maternal perisperm, which occupies a larger area than the
diploid or polyploid fertilized endosperm. This character
variation implies that the storage function was largely
taken over by the perisperm secondarily [49,50] and that
the fossil seed may have been on the way toward perispermy.
The fossil seed vasculature is different from that of extant
Trimenia. In Trimenia, the vascular bundle supplied from
the fruit wall enters the raphe of the seed and extends to
the antiraphal side beyond the chalaza [4]. Lack of antiraphal vascular bundles in the fossil seed suggests that the
antiraphal bundle is a derived character in the Trimeniaceae. This is consistent with the hypothesis, based on
character distribution in extant basalmost angiosperms,
that the antiraphal bundle is a derived character in the
angiosperm seed [6,51].
So far, we know only the seed of this trimeniaceous fossil,
but the areoles sculptured in the seed surface may imply
that the fossil seed was contained in a berry because the
pressure of berry endocarp cells forms areoles on seeds of
extant Trimenia [1-7].
Biogeography
Extant Trimeniaceae species are distributed in eastern Australia and an island chain stretching from Celebes to the
Moluccas, New Guinea, New Caledonia, Fiji, Samoa, and
the Marquesas [1,2,4]. Along with the Trimeniaceae, other
basalmost families (Amborellaceae, Hydatellaceae, Austrobaileyaceae) and many eumagnoliid families (e.g.,
Degeneriaceae, Monimiaceae, Winteraceae) now grow
only in derivative fragments of Gondwanaland [1,4,52].
Contrary to their extant austral distribution, palynological
records suggest that early angiosperms originated in the
low latitudes [25,26] and migrated both northward and
southward [26-28]. Thus, the paleobotanical data indicate
that the current austral distributions do not reflect the cradle of angiosperms but the area of conservation [26-28].
At the same time, the poleward migration model predicts
the past occurrence of these basalmost angiosperm families in the Northern Hemisphere. Some pollen grains, ten-

tatively assigned to the Amborellaceae [53] or
Trimeniaceae [15,17,20], are reported from the Northern
Hemisphere, but familial assignations of pollen are difficult [20,29,46]. The fossil seed reveals that Trimeniaceae
occurred in the eastern margin of Laurasia in the Northern
Hemisphere during the Albian period and indicates a
reduction to the relict area subsequent to the hypothesized bipolar migration.

Conclusion
Fossil seed of Trimeniaceae is described from the Early
Cretaceous (ca. 100 million years ago) Yezo Group in
Hokkaido, northern Japan. The seed, which is the oldest
yet found for the family, indicates; 1) Some seed coat
structures of Trimeniaceae have been conserved for about
100 million years, including the multilayered stony exotesta with alveolate surface, parenchymatous mesotesta,
and operculate inner integument. 2) The secondary origins of the perisperm and antiraphal vascular bundle. 3)
Trimeniaceae was distributed in a midlatitude location of
the Northern Hemisphere during the Early Cretaceous,
when angiosperms radiated extensively, supporting that
the extant austral distribution is relict.

Methods
Materials (Yamada 001002) and methods for plastic sections and SEM micrograph of Trimenia moorei (extant)
were described previously [7]. The fossil seed was sectioned in planes tangential to the raphe, and the extant
seed was sectioned in planes parallel to the raphe. A part
of the fossil seed, 1.5 mm thick, was cut into 38 successive
peel sections, i.e., one section is ca. 40 μm thick. For
reconstruction, the outline of the seed surface was traced,
and surface views were compiled manually by overlying
successive camera lucida drawings. The slides of serial sections and the nodule containing the seed are stored in the
National Museum of Nature and Science, Tokyo, Japan, as
NSM-PP-9176.
