Phylogenomics reveals subfamilies of fungal
nonribosomal peptide synthetases and their
evolutionary relationships
Kathryn E Bushley, B Gillian Turgeon*

Abstract
Background: Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are multimodular enzymes, found in fungi and bacteria,
which biosynthesize peptides without the aid of ribosomes. Although their metabolite products have been the
subject of intense investigation due to their life-saving roles as medicinals and injurious roles as mycotoxins and
virulence factors, little is known of the phylogenetic relationships of the corresponding NRPSs or whether they can
be ranked into subgroups of common function. We identified genes (NPS) encoding NRPS and NRPS-like proteins
in 38 fungal genomes and undertook phylogenomic analyses in order to identify fungal NRPS subfamilies, assess
taxonomic distribution, evaluate levels of conservation across subfamilies, and address mechanisms of evolution of
multimodular NRPSs. We also characterized relationships of fungal NRPSs, a representative sampling of bacterial
NRPSs, and related adenylating enzymes, including a-aminoadipate reductases (AARs) involved in lysine
biosynthesis in fungi.
Results: Phylogenomic analysis identified nine major subfamilies of fungal NRPSs which fell into two main groups:
one corresponds to NPS genes encoding primarily mono/bi-modular enzymes which grouped with bacterial NRPSs
and the other includes genes encoding primarily multimodular and exclusively fungal NRPSs. AARs shared a closer
phylogenetic relationship to NRPSs than to other acyl-adenylating enzymes. Phylogenetic analyses and taxonomic
distribution suggest that several mono/bi-modular subfamilies arose either prior to, or early in, the evolution of
fungi, while two multimodular groups appear restricted to and expanded in fungi. The older mono/bi-modular
subfamilies show conserved domain architectures suggestive of functional conservation, while multimodular NRPSs,
particularly those unique to euascomycetes, show a diversity of architectures and of genetic mechanisms
generating this diversity.
Conclusions: This work is the first to characterize subfamilies of fungal NRPSs. Our analyses suggest that mono/bimodular NRPSs have more ancient origins and more conserved domain architectures than most multimodular
NRPSs. It also demonstrates that the a-aminoadipate reductases involved in lysine biosynthesis in fungi are closely
related to mono/bi-modular NRPSs. Several groups of mono/bi-modular NRPS metabolites are predicted to play
more pivotal roles in cellular metabolism than products of multimodular NRPSs. In contrast, multimodular
subfamilies of NRPSs are of more recent origin, are restricted to fungi, show less stable domain architectures, and
biosynthesize metabolites which perform more niche-specific functions than mono/bi-modular NRPS products. The
euascomycete-only NRPS subfamily, in particular, shows evidence for extensive gain and loss of domains
suggestive of the contribution of domain duplication and loss in responding to niche-specific pressures.

Background
Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are multimodular megasynthases which catalyze biosynthesis of
small bioactive peptides (NRPs) via a thiotemplate
mechanism independent of ribosomes [1-5]. NRPS
encoding genes (NPSs) are plentiful in fungi and bacteria but are not known in plants or animals. The
enzymes they encode biosynthesize a staggering diversity
of chemical products because their substrates can
include both D and L forms of the 20 amino acids used
in ribosomal protein synthesis, as well as non-proteinogenic amino acids such as ornithine, imino acids, and
hydroxy acids such as a-aminoadipic and a-butyric
acids [1]. The natural functions of most NRPs for producing organisms are largely unknown, although
recently it has become clearer that they play fundamental roles in fungal reproductive and pathogenic development, morphology, cell surface properties, stress
management, and nutrient procurement [6-15] in addition to better-known roles as toxins/mycotoxins
involved in plant or animal pathogenesis or as life-saving pharmaceuticals such as antibiotics, immunosuppressants, and anticancer agents.
NRPSs use a set of core domains, known as a module, to
accomplish peptide synthesis. A minimal module consists
of three core domains: an adenylation (A) domain which
recognizes and activates the substrate via adenylation with
ATP, a thiolation (T) or peptidyl carrier protein (PCP)
domain which binds the activated substrate to a 4’-phosphopantetheine (PP) cofactor via a thioester bond and
transfers the substrate to a condensation (C) domain
which catalyzes peptide bond formation between adjacent
substrates on the megasynthase complex [1]. Several specialized C-terminal domains involved in chain termination
and release of the final peptide product have also been
identified [16,17]. In bacteria, chain release is most commonly effected by a thioesterase (TE) domain [18], which
releases the peptide by either hydrolysis or internal cyclization [16,17,19]. In fungi, only a few NRPSs, such as the
ACV synthetases, are known to release products via a TE
domain and chain release is carried out by a variety of
mechanisms, two of which predominate and occur less
frequently in bacterial systems: 1) a terminal C domain,
which catalyzes release by inter- or intra-molecular amide
bond formation [16], and 2) a thioesterase NADP(H)
dependent reductase (R) domain [20-23], which catalyzes
reduction with NADPH to form an aldehyde. An additional mechanism, which has been reported only in biosynthesis of fungal ergot alkaloids, involves nonenzymatic
cyclization by formation of a diketopiperazine ring [16,24].
NRPSs may contain additional modifying domains
which alter the substrate during NRPS biosynthesis: 1)
an epimerization (E) domain which catalyzes

Page 2 of 23

epimerization of an amino acid from the L to the D
configuration [25], 2) an N-methylation (M) domain
(methyltransferase) which catalyzes transfer of a methyl
group from an S-adenosylmethionine to an a-amino of
the amino acid substrate, and 3) a specialized C domain
termed a cyclization (Cyc) domain which catalyzes formation of oxazoline or thiazoline rings by internal cyclization of cysteine, serine, or threonine residues [26].
Additional tailoring enzymes which are not part of the
NRPS may modify either the substrate or the final peptide product by glycosylation, hydroxylation, acylation,
or halogenation [27,28].
NRPSs may be monomodular, consisting of a single
A-T-C module, or multimodular, consisting of repeated
A-T-C modules. The suite of 14 NRPSs found in the
genome of the Dothideomycete Cochliobolus heterostrophus is representative of the diversity of NPS genes in
filamentous ascomycetes in that it contains a representative from most currently recognized groups of fungal
NRPSs [10,6], and, with the exception of duplicated
copies of ChNPS12, the modular domain architectures
of each encoded enzyme are distinct (Additional file 1).
In addition to mono- and multi-modular NPSs, a hybrid
gene (ChNPS7; PKS24) encoding an incomplete NRPS
module (A-T) fused to a polyketide synthase (PKS) unit
is present [10,29]. Hybrid PKS;NRPS synthetases (e.g.
ACE1, SYN2 in Magnaporthe oryzae), the reverse organization of ChNPS7;PKS24, are more common in filamentous fungi as well as in bacteria [30-34], although C.
heterostrophus lacks a representative. PKSs, found in
fungi, bacteria, and plants are large megasynthases,
related to fatty acid synthases, that biosynthesize small
molecule polyketides with as diverse natural functions
as NRPS metabolites.
The evolutionary mechanisms giving rise to genes
encoding enzymes with such diverse modular architectures are clearly complex. Likely mechanisms include: 1)
tandem duplication and loss of individual modules or
domains, 2) gene fusion/fission, and 3) recombination
and/or gene conversion of individual modules or
domains either within the same NPS or between different NPSs. It has been suggested that genes involved in
secondary metabolite (small molecule) biosynthesis tend
to be located in subtelomeric regions, a factor which
may contribute to their rapid evolution by the aforementioned mechanisms [35,36].
NPSs are generally recognized as a rapidly evolving gene
class in fungi leading to few clearly identifiable orthologs
between species and highly discontinuous distributions
[10,37,38]. However, as has been observed for members of
other eukaryotic gene families (e.g., major histocompatibility complex [39], immune response [40], zinc-finger [41],
reproductive [42], olfactory/chemosensory [43-47],
MADS-box [48], and F-box gene families [49] among

Bushley and Turgeon BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:26
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/26

others), within each family, conservation and rates of gene
duplication and loss are likely to vary among subgroups of
genes encoding proteins of different function. In fact,
some C. heterostrophus NPSs (NPS2, NPS4, NPS6 and
NPS10), are conserved or moderately conserved across
euascomycote fungi [8,10,50] and their NRP products are
involved in basic cellular functions such as growth and
development, reproduction, and pathogenesis [6-8]. The
majority of NPSs, however, are highly discontinuously distributed across fungal taxa and even closely related species
may share only a few homologs. Some, e.g., Cochliobolus
carbonum HTS1, the gene encoding the NRPS for biosynthesis of HC-toxin [51], and Alternaria alternata apple
pathotype AMT, the gene encoding the NRPS for biosynthesis of AM-toxin [52], appear unique even to one
race or pathotype within a single species. These lineagespecific synthetases tend to have more specialized, nichespecific functions.
Higher rates of gene duplication and loss may reflect
an adaptive response to selective pressure from pathogens, interactions with other organisms, or other environmental pressures. Recent work suggests that, in fungi,
genes involved in responses to stress are more likely to
undergo duplication and loss than growth related genes
[53]. Thus, we hypothesize that NRPSs with conserved
functions involved in growth and development will
show less variation in gene copy number and maintain a
relatively conserved domain architecture in comparison
with NRPSs with more niche-specific functions.
The multimodular structure of NRPSs and the complex mechanisms by which they evolve present challenges to phylogenetic analysis and consequently little
work has been done to characterize phylogenetic relationships across this large class of megasynthases or to
ask whether subclasses of common function can be
identified, based on close relationships with NRPSs
whose chemical products are known. In this study, we
undertook phylogenomic analyses on a comprehensive
dataset of fungal NRPS proteins to: 1) identify major
subfamilies, 2) analyze patterns of distribution of these
major subfamilies across fungal taxonomic groups, 3)
understand relationships among selected bacterial
NRPSs, fungal monomodular NRPS/NRPS-like proteins,
fungal multimodular NRPSs, and related adenylating
enzymes, including a-aminoadipate reductases involved
in lysine biosynthesis in fungi, 4) consider mechanisms
of evolution of multimodular NRPSs, and 5) analyze patterns of NRPS gene and A domain duplication and loss
across fungi.

Results and Discussion
Identification and domain structure of candidate NRPSs

Candidate NRPSs extracted from each sequenced genome are listed in Additional file 2. Genus and species

abbreviations for all organisms mentioned in this study
are shown in Additional file 3. The proposed domain
structure for each NRPS, based on searches with our
fungal-specific HMMER models (Additional file 4) and
the PFAM and Interpro databases, is shown in Additional file 2. The majority of multimodular NRPSs were
composed of one or more standard NRPS modules (AT-C) with or without modifying domains (E, M, etc),
while most monomodular NRPSs lacked complete A-TC modules and consisted of a single A domain or an AT unit followed by a variety of C-terminal domains, several of which have not previously been identified as core
NRPS domains (Additional file 2).
Phylogenomic analysis and subfamily identification

All known NRPS/NRPS-like proteins formed a monophyletic group supported by greater than 90% bootstrap
support in ML analyses and greater than 50% bootstrap
support in the NJ analysis (Fig. 1), separating them from
most other known adenylating enzymes selected as
potential outgroups, e.g., Acyl AMP ligases (AAL), CPS1
[54], Long Chain Fatty Acid ligases (LCFAL), AcetylCoA synthetases (ACoAS), and Ochratoxin synthetases
(OCHRA)(Fig. 1, Additional file 5). The a-aminoadipate
reductases (AAR), homologs of S. cerevisiae Lys2
[23,55,56,56,57], grouped within this well-supported
clade of NRPS/NRPS-like proteins rather than with the
other adenylating enzymes (Figs. 1, 2, Additional file 6),
suggesting that AARs are more closely related to NRPSs
than to other adenylating enzymes.
The tree topologies resulting from phylogenetic analyses of individual A domains revealed two major groups
of fungal NRPSs (Fig. 1, Additional file 6). The first
group (Fig. 1, light blue rectangle) consists of primarily
mono- or bi-modular fungal NRPSs which group with
bacterial NRPS A domains. Exceptions to the predominately mono/bi-modular fungal NRPS structures include
the ACV synthetases and the clade containing A
domains from the eleven modules of SimA (cyclosporin
biosynthesis) [58] and from several related fungal
NRPSs. The other large group contains exclusively fungal and primarily multimodular NRPSs and includes
siderophore synthetases and a group we term the Euascomycete-only synthetases, as its members are restricted
to euascomycetes. Both grouped together with greater
than 97% bootstrap support in analyses of a reduced
dataset which included selected representatives from
each subfamily (Fig. 2, red arrow, Additional file 7).
Phylogenetic analyses identified nine major subfamilies
of fungal NRPSs. Subfamilies were defined as the most
internal branch from the root node that formed a
monophyletic group which was supported by greater
than >70% bootstrap support, shared identical taxon
composition across all three phylogenetic methods, and
contained a representative fungal NRPS. These groups

were named after a representative C. heterostrophus or
other fungal NRPSs of well-known function in the
group (Figs. 1, 2, Additional file 6). Subfamilies include:
1) fungal PKS;NRPS hybrids, 2) ChNPS11/ETP toxin
module 1 synthetases, ChNPS12-like/ETP module 2
toxin-like synthetases, 4) ChNPS10-like synthetases, 5)
Cyclosporin synthetases (CYCLO), 6) a-aminoadipate
reductases (AAR), 7) ACV synthetases (ACV), 8) siderophore synthetases (SID), and 9) the Euascomycete-only
synthetases (EAS). Deep phylogenetic relationships
among mono/bi-modular subfamilies were unresolved
and lacked bootstrap support (Figs. 1, 2, Additional file
6A-C). A domains from a few ascomycete
(BC1G11613.1, MGG 14967.5, MGG07803.5) and several urediniomycete (UM05245.1, Sr31423, and
PGTG06519.1) proteins did not group with any of the
major subfamilies and were not placed consistently in
the trees when assessed by different phylogenetic methods. Homologs of bimodular A. fumigatus SidE, a putative siderophore synthetase [37], formed two clades
corresponding to each module and consistently grouped
with the SID subfamily but without bootstrap support in
the larger phylogeny and with low bootstrap support
(>50%) in the reduced phylogeny. We term this group
SIDE but do not consider them as a major subfamily
(Fig. 2, Additional files 6A-C, 7)
Relationships between fungal and bacterial NRPSs:
horizontal transfer or vertical transmission and massive
loss?

The majority of bacterial sequences (Additional file 8),
identified as top hits in blast searches using a representative from each of the major fungal NRPS subfamilies
to query the public databases, were eubacterial in origin
and formed a monophyletic group (although lacking
bootstrap support), which we term the major bacterial
clade (Figs. 1, 2, gray, Additional file 6). This clade contains two fungal representatives suspected of being horizontally transmitted from bacteria to fungi. One is the
fungal ChNPS7;PKS24 hybrid NRPS;PKS synthetase
which is nested within this clade; previous independent
analyses of both the NRPS [10] and the PKS portion of
this protein [29] found the same placement (Fig. 2,
Additional file 6). The other is the ACV synthetases, a
group postulated to have been horizontally transferred
from bacteria to fungi [59-64], which groups as sister to,
or within, the major bacterial clade (Figs. 1, 2, Additional file 6). Our analysis also shows that each of the
three fungal ACV synthetase A domains groups with
the corresponding bacterial A domain rather than forming separate clades of fungal and bacterial A domains.
These results support previous claims of horizontal
transfer based on observations of closer sequence similarity than expected between these fungal and bacterial
genes [61-64] (Fig. 2, Additional file 6).

Page 6 of 23

In contrast, bacterial siderophore synthetases (eg. Pyoverdine (PvdD, PvdI, PvdJ, PvdL), yersiniabactin (ybtE),
and Pyochelin (PchE, PchF)) group separately from fungal NRPSs (SID) that biosynthesize intracellular siderophores and fungal NRPSs (NPS6) in the EAS subfamily
that biosynthesize extracellular siderophores (Fig. 2,
Additional file 6). This suggests that fungal and bacterial
capacities to chelate iron via small molecule siderophores have evolved independently (Fig. 2).
The remaining bacterial A domains included in this
study that grouped with high bootstrap support with
fungal A domains were associated with the ChNPS12like/ETP module 2 and AAR subfamilies (Fig. 2, Additional file 6). Bacterial representatives of the former
included representatives from the gammaproteobacterium (Hahella chejuensis) and two closely related species
of actinobacteria (Salinospora sp.); of the latter, all are
closely related species of Pseudomonads. In the two
cases of proposed horizontal transfer discussed above (e.
g., ChNPS7 [10,29], and ACV [59-64] synthetases), the
fungal genes are nested within a large clade of bacterial
sequences. The reverse phylogenetic situation is
observed for bacterial genes grouping with the AAR and
ChNPS12 subfamilies as, in these cases, bacterial NRPSs,
are nested within a large clade of fungal NRPSs
(ChNPS12) or group as sister to fungal NRPSs (AARs).
These placements suggest that either the fungal genes
were transferred to bacteria or that the origin of these
groups predates the divergence of eukaryotes and prokaryotes and the observed pattern reflects extensive loss
or incomplete sampling from bacteria. Clearly, further
sampling of bacterial sequences is needed to adequately
address these hypotheses, but we favor the theory that
these NRPS subfamilies may have originated prior to the
divergence of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. We hypothesize that the lack of phylogenetic signal for resolving
relationships among the fungal mono/bi-modular subfamilies may in part reflect an ancient and rapid radiation
of these groups.
Distribution of NRPS subfamilies across fungal taxonomic
groups

The distribution of fungal NRPS subfamilies across the
major fungal taxonomic groups supports previous findings that NRPSs are much more abundant in Euascomycetes than in Basidiomycetes and are scarce in
Chytridiomycota, Zygomycota, Schizosaccharomycota,
and Hemiascomycota [10,65,66]. The number and distribution of NRPSs in each subfamily are shown in Table
1. EAS and PKS;NRPS subfamilies were significantly
overrepresented in Euascomycete taxa when evaluated
by Fisher’s exact tests, while ChNPS12-like synthetases
were statistically overrepresented in Basidiomycete taxa
(Table 1, asterisks). The Chytridiomycota, Zygomycota,
Schizosaccharomycota, and Hemiascomycota contained

Bushley and Turgeon BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:26
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/26

only a few NRPSs. All Zygomycota and Hemiascomycota lacked genes encoding NRPS-type proteins other
than a single AAR. The chytrid genome contained two
additional NRPS-like proteins grouping with the
ChNPS12/ETP module 2 subfamily, and the two Schizosaccharomycota taxa examined contained one additional
NRPS for siderophore biosynthesis (Table 1). No subfamilies were statistically overrepresented in these groups.
Lineage specific expansions and contractions

When patterns of gene duplication and loss were analyzed for the total number of NRPSs/genome (combining all subfamilies) over the tree of fungi (Fig. 3;
Additional file 9), a highly significant expansion was
found on the branch leading to Euascomycetes (p = 7 ×
10 -5 ). Significant expansions were also found within
euascomycetes on the branches leading to the Aspergillus species (p = .028), to F. graminearum (p = .011) and
to M. oryzae (p = .032). N. crassa showed a highly significant (p = 5 × 10-5) contraction in total number of
NRPS genes (Fig. 3), likely due to the efficiency of RIP
and/or other genome defense mechanisms, that reduce
the rate of fixation of duplicates [67,68].
Our data support previous findings [66], including our
own [10], that unicellular fungi have few, if any, genes
for secondary metabolism (Table 1, Fig. 3). Ancestral
reconstructions show that in hemiascomycete yeasts,
this is due to loss of all NRPSs, except for a single AAR
encoding gene, that were present in basidiomycetes and
inferred to be present in the ancestor of ascomycetes
(Fig. 3). However, both the fission yeast S. pombe and
the unicellular basidiomycete yeast Sporobolomyces
roseus contain one additional gene encoding a NRPS (a
siderophore synthetase and an unknown, respectively) in
additional to the single AAR encoding gene, suggesting
that a unicellular habit may not preclude the existence
of secondary metabolite genes such as NRPSs. Patterns
of expansion and contraction also do not seem to occur
preferentially in fungal pathogens versus nonpathogens.
While a number of pathogenic fungi (e.g., F. graminearum, A. fumigatus, and M. oryzae) do show evidence
for expansions in numbers of NRPS, we also see expansion in the nonpathogen, A. nidulans.
Subfamily distribution
AAR: A single ortholog of S. cerevisiae Lys2, the AAR

involved in reduction of a-aminoadipic acid in the fungal lysine biosynthetic pathway [23,69], was found in all
fungi surveyed except the Microsporidian, Enchephalitozoon cuniculi, an intracellular parasite which has lost
the majority of genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis [70] and the heterokaryotic basidiomycete Postia
placenta, which contains two (Table 1)(Additional file
2).
ChNPS11/ETP/ChNPS12: In a phylogeny of a reduced set
of representative A domains from each subfamily (Fig.

Page 7 of 23

2), homologs of ChNPS11, ChNPS12, and the ETP toxin
synthetases, GliP for Gliotoxin and SirP for Sirodesmin
production, group together with strong bootstrap support (>80%), suggesting all share a common evolutionary
origin. In the larger phylogeny of the complete dataset
(Fig. 1, Additional file 6), they formed two separate
clades each supported by >70% bootstrap support, but
lacked this level of support for the entire group. The
first clade (ChNPS11/ETP module 1) includes the first
module of the ETP toxin synthetases and monomodular
ChNPS11. The second module of the ETP toxin synthetases, however, groups within a larger clade containing
the two NRPSs from the chytrid genome, several eubacterial NRPSs, and a clade containing both euascomycete
and basidiomycete homologs of ChNPS12 (ChNPS12/
ETP module 2). While fungal NRPSs associated with
ChNPS11 and ETP toxin synthetases are found only in
Euascomycota, NRPSs from both eubacteria and from
the most basal fungal group, Chytridiomycota, were
nested within this larger clade with high bootstrap support (>80%) (Figs. 1, 2).
ChNPS10, CYCLO, SID: Three subfamilies, monomodular
ChNPS10, NRPSs grouping with SIMA (CYCLO), and
NRPSs (SID) involved in intracellular (primarily) siderophore biosynthesis, contain representatives from both
Basidiomycota and Euascomycota. While all euascomycetes and many basidiomycetes examined contain at
least one representative from the SID subfamily (Table
1) [65], ChNPS10 and CYCLO are more discontinuously
distributed and a representative is not found in all taxa
(Table 1, Additional file. 6).
ACV and PKS;NRPS: PKS;NRPSs were restricted to and
statistically overrepresented in euascomycetes. As has
been noted previously [29,71], all fungal PKS;NRPS
hybrids fall into a single, well supported, monophyletic
group, which suggests a single origin (Table 1). However, not all ascomycetes have a representative of this
group and the number of corresponding genes varies
widely among taxa (Table 1). C. heterostrophus, for
example, lacks a representative but M. oryzae has six.
While ACV synthetases are found in both bacteria and
fungi, within fungi, they appear restricted to Eurotiomycete and Hypocrealean taxa. This study did not identify
any additional ACV synthetases in fungi apart from the
known ones in Penicillium chrysogenum, Aspergillus
nidulans, and Cephalosporium acremonium (Additional
files 2, 6), supporting previous conclusions that their
distribution is likely the product of one or more isolated
horizontal transfer events [59,61-64].
Euascomycete only (EAS): The EAS subfamily contains by
far the greatest number of NRPSs and is both restricted
to and statistically overrepresented in Euascomycetes
(Table 1).

Based on inclusion in clades of phylogenetically defined subfamilies (Fig. 1, Additional file 6).
Several proteins which grouped with NRPSs did not group with any of the 9 major subfamilies. These include homologs of SidE (Afu3g03350) in A. fumigatus
and P. anserina species (Afu3g15270, Pa2_7870), several proteins in the urediniomycetes U. maydis, S. roseus, and P. graminis (UM05245.1, Sr31423, and
PGTG06519), two proteins in M. oryzae (MGG 14967.5, MGG07803.5), and one in B. cinerea (BC1G11613.1).
c
A. fumigatus has two bi-modular NRPSs (Afu_6g09660, Afu_6g09660) as does T. reesii (Trire2_24586, Trire2_60458). The first modules of all four NRPSs group
with the ChNPS11/ETP module 1 subfamily; the second modules group with the NPS12 subfamily. For tallying purposes, Afu_6g09660, Afu_6g0966, Trire2_24586,
and Trire2_60458 were attributed to the ChNPS11/ETP module 1 subfamily.
d
ChNPS1 and ChNPS3 modules 1 and 3 group with the EAS subfamily, while ChNPS1 module 2 and ChNPS3 modules 2 and 4 group with the CYCLO subfamily.
For tallying purposes, ChNPS1 and ChNPS3 were attributed to the CYCLO subfamily. Similarly, MGG00022.1 and AN9226 also have some A domains in the CYCLO
subfamily and others in the EAS subfamily. For tallying purposes, these genes were included in the CYCLO subfamily.
e
B. cinerea contains 3 PKS;NRPS hybrids. For one of these (BC1G15479.1), the A domain did not align well and was missing several core motifs. This protein was
removed from the final phylogenetic analysis.
* PKS:NRPS and EAS subfamilies in Euascomycetes and the NPS12/ETP module 2 subfamily in Basidiomycetes are statistically over-represented.

Dikarya (Fig. 4). The EAS, PKS;NRPS, and ACV synthetases contained only euascomycete representatives. Both
PKS;NRPS and EAS may thus have originated in the
ancestor of euascomycetes (Fig. 4). As discussed above,
the grouping of fungal ACV synthetase A domains with
the corresponding A domains of bacterial ACV synthetases within a large clade of bacterial sequences provides
evidence for horizontal transfer and suggests that this
group originated within prokaryotes (Fig. 4).
Thus, taxonomic distributions suggest a more ancient
origin of one or more of the mono/bi-modular NRPS
subfamilies (ChNPS11/ETP/ChNPS12, ACV), possibly
predating the divergence of eubacteria and fungi (Table
1, Fig. 4). The strongly supported co-grouping of fungal
and bacterial sequences in the ChNPS11/ETP/ChNPS12
group, as in the outgroup adenylating enzymes (Fig. 2,
Additional file 6A-C) suggests this is a tenable hypothesis. ACV is a special case and likely the result of horizontal transfer from bacteria to fungi. In contrast, the
fungal-specific multimodular groups (SID and EAS),
which group together with high bootstrap support in
the reduced phylogeny (Table 1, Fig. 2, Additional file
6A-C), appear to be of more recent origin and are
restricted to and highly expanded in fungi.

Figure 3 Lineage specific expansions and contractions in
number of NRPS genes per genome. Inferred number of NRPS
encoding genes at ancestral nodes mapped onto the ultrametric
tree of fungi. Timescale in millions of years is shown along bottom.
Branches with significant expansions (blue) or contractions (red) are
shown with associated p-values above branches. The largest
contraction in number of NRPSs occurs in N. crassa while the largest
expansion occurs in the ancestor of euascomycetes. A highly
significant expansion also occurs in F. graminearum and significant
expansions occur in several other euascomycete taxa (e.g., M. oryzae
and on the branch leading to the Aspergillus species).

Hypothesized origins based on taxonomic distribution

Fig. 4 shows the hypothesized origins of each subfamily
based on taxonomic distribution of the oldest member
of each group. By this criterion, the presence of bacterial
sequences grouping within the ChNPS11/ETP module 1
and ChNPS12/ETP module 2 clades suggests that the
origins of these groups may predate the divergence of
eubacteria and eukaryotes (Figs. 2, 4). The AAR subfamily must have arisen also either prior to or very early in
the origin of the fungi as a representative is present in
all fungi, including the most basal group, the Chytridiomycota (Table 1, Figs. 2, 4). Since the SID, CYCLO, and
ChNPS10 subfamilies all contain representatives from
both Euascomycota and Basidiomycota, these groups
must have evolved prior to the divergence of the

Figure 4 Hypothesized origins of major fungal NRPS
subfamilies based on the oldest member of each subfamily.
Subfamilies color coded as in Fig. 1. AAR, and ChNPS11/ETPmodule
1 and ChNPS12/ETP module 2 likely originated prior to or early in
the divergence of fungi. AAR genes are present in all fungi, while
the ChNPS11/ETP/ChNPS12 clade contains representatives of the
most ancestral fungal group, the Chytridiomycota. as well as
bacterial sequences that nest with high bootstrap support within
this clade. Although ACV genes are clearly present in eubacteria,
they appear to have been horizontally transferred to euascomycete
fungi, hence their dual placement. The CYCLO, ChNPS10, and SID
subfamilies were found in Basidiomycota, Schizosaccharomycota,
and Euascomycota and thus likely originated in an ancestor of the
Dikarya. Fungal PKS;NRPS hybrids and EAS were found only in
Euascomycetes.

Mono- and bi- modular NRPS subfamilies

Unlike many of the multimodular NRPSs, most monomodular subfamilies lack a complete NRPS module (AT-C) and consist of a single A domain or an A-T
domain combination followed by a variety of C-terminal
domains (Fig. 5). Many of the mono/bi-modular groups
show a conserved domain architecture across all members in a subfamily, suggesting their domain architectures may be functionally constrained. Available
functional data suggest that the NRP products of several
of these groups may play more central roles in cellular
metabolism related to responses to oxidative stress and
growth and development.
Whether monomodular NRPSs may act alone or in
concert with non-NRPS proteins is currently unknown.
However, in bacterial systems, both single A domains as
well as A-T domain units, known as initiation modules,
can interact with other NRPS proteins and accomplish
biosynthesis by first activating and then transfering the
activated substrate either to a C domain in the same
NRPS or to a C domain in a different NRPS (nonlinear
biosynthesis) [5].
AARs and Lysine biosynthesis

AARs are conserved not only taxonomically but also in
terms of domain structure. All have an identical structure consisting of an A-T unit followed by a thioester

Page 10 of 23

reductase (R) domain (IPR010080), a member of the
NAD(P)-binding Rossman fold domain superfamily
(SSF51735). There are two primary pathways for lysine
biosynthesis, the diaminopimelic acid pathway (DAP),
found predominantly in bacteria and plants, and the aaminoadipate pathway (AAA), found primarily in fungi
and a few bacteria [69]. As noted above, AARs catalyze
reduction of a-aminoadipic acid in the AAA pathway
[69]. The fact that AARs have a C-terminal R domain in
common with several other NRPS subfamilies (PKS;
NPRS, ChNPS10, EAS, discussed below) supports our
conclusions based on phylogenetic relationships that
AARs are more closely related to NRPSs than other adenylating enzymes (Fig. 5).
Bacterial sequences grouping with fungal AAR are
comprised of a single A domain followed by an acyltransferase domain (PFAM01757) but lack the C-terminal R domain found in fungal AARs. We conclude that
they are likely not involved in lysine biosynthesis in bacteria. Although there is evidence for the existence of
lysine biosynthesis through the AAA pathway in some
prokaryotes [72], current data suggests that these pathways do not include a step involving reduction of aaminoadipic acid [72]. Thus, our data support previous
conclusions that AARs are fungal-specific enzymes
[73-75].
PKS;NRPS

Nearly all fungal PKS;NRPS hybrids have the same
domain structure (KS-AT-M-KR-ACP-C-A-T-R) (Fig. 5,
Additional file 2). The terminal R domain has been
reported previously in several PKS;NRPS hybrids
[76-78].
ChNPS10

The ChNPS10 subfamily also has a conserved domain
architecture across all genes in the subfamily, consisting
of an A-T unit followed by two additional C-terminal
domains. The first is a NAD(P) binding domain
(IPR016040) also showing closest similarity to thioesterase reductase (R) domains and the second is a dehydrogenase domain with closest hits to ADH short chain
dehydrogenases (IPR002198) (Fig. 5).
ChNPS11/ETP/ChNPS12

Figure 5 Conserved domain architectures for mono-bimodular
NRPS subfamilies. The majority of mono-bimodular subfamilies
have an A-T domain structure followed by various C-terminal
domains. Only ChNPS11/ETP module 1 and ETP module 2 show
complete A-T-C modules. The ChNPS12/ETP module 2 subfamily
also contains representatives consisting of a single A domain.
Domains: A = adenylation, T = thiolation, C = condensation, R =
thioester reductase, D = ADH short chain dehydrogenase, PKS =
polyketide synthase module, FeR = ferric reductase, FSH/SH = serine
hydrolase, RH = polynucleotidyl transferase, Ribonuclease H, LPS =
LPS-induced tumor necrosis alpha factor.

The large and highly diverse clade of ChNPS11/ETP/
ChNPS12 homologs reveals the diversity of C-terminal
domains that can follow A-T units and shows that, as
for some bacterial NRPSs, fungal NRPS or NRPS-like
proteins can consist of single A domains (Figs. 5, 6).
At the base of this group are monomodular ChNPS11
and module 1 of the bimodular ETP toxin synthetases,
SirP and GliP, which contain complete A-T-C modules
(Fig. 6). Module 2 of SirP and GliP groups at the base
of the ChNPS12/ETP module 2 clade. The second module of the ETP toxin synthetases contains a complete
module followed by an additional T domain (A-T-C-T)

Figure 6 Phylogeny of the ChNPS11/ETP/ChNPS12 subclade. Extracted from maximum likelihood (PhyML with WAG plus gamma
substitution matrix) phylogeny of complete A domain dataset (Additional file 6B). Domain structure of each NRPS is shown to the right of
species abbreviation and accession number. Orange highlighted A domains reflect corresponding A domain in the phylogeny. Orange branches
= ChNPS11/ETP mod1 and blue = ChNPS12/ETP mod2 subfamilies. ChNPS11 is monomodular, while all other NRPSs in the ETP module 1 group
are bimodular; all have complete A-T-C modules. The A domain from a M. oryzae NRPS;PKS (MG07803.6) also groups here. Members of the
ChNPS12 subfamily show a diversity of C-terminal domains as described in text and Fig. 5. The group includes two putative NRPSs from the
chytrid, B. dendrobatidis, two proteins with either an incomplete (MGG15248.6) or a degenerate (BC1G07441_07442.1) first module and
monomodular bacterial proteins consisting of single A domains. ChNPS12 homologs in Basidiomycete NPS12 group 2 consist of proteins with
single A domains which appear to lack additional C-terminal domains and are highly expanded in the basidiomycete Postia placenta.

(Fig. 6). This group also contains several fungal proteins
with an incomplete (MGG15248.6) or a degenerate
(BC1G07441_07442.1) first module (Figs. 2, 5).
Nested within this clade is a group of bacterial NRPSs
with a single A domain and two NRPS-like proteins
from the chytrid B. dentrobatidis (Fig. 6). One of the
chytrid NRPSs (BDEG_03514.1) has a T-C-T-A-T
domain architecture followed by a domain with similarity to FSH1 (IPR005645), a serine hydrolase domain.
The other chytrid protein (BDEG_08447.1) has an A-T
unit followed by two additional domains. The first
shows closest similarity to polynucleotidyl transferase,

Ribonuclease H fold (IPR012337), a domain associated
with nucleic acid binding functions and found in a variety of proteins including HIV RNase H, transposases,
and exonucleases [79,80] (Fig. 6). The second domain
shows closest similarity to the membrane-associated
domain LPS-induced tumor necrosis factor alpha factor
(LITAF, IPR006629, PF10601), which contains a characteristic cysteine rich zinc-binding motif found also in
intracellular Zn2+ binding proteins and animal transcription factors. The zinc and DNA-binding domains found
in the chytrid NRPSs are intriguing (Fig. 5). Gliotoxin
and Sirodesmin PL have been shown to inhibit viral

Bushley and Turgeon BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:26
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/26

reverse transcriptase [81] and general transcription [82],
respectively. In the case of Sirodesmin PL, the addition
of zinc and other IIB series metals (Hg and Cd) both
decreases toxin production in Leptosphaeria maculans
and also reverses the inhibition of transcription, suggesting interactions of Sirodesmin PL with either cellular
zinc or zinc-containing metalloenzymes such as RNA
polymerases [82,83]. Whether these phenotypes relate to
our identification of Zn-binding domains in the corresponding chytrid NRPS is unknown.
ChNPS12 (CocheC5_118012), and its paralog
(CocheC5_116719) contain a single A domain followed
by a domain showing closest similarity to a ferric reductase transmembrane domain (IPR013130). The closest
homologs of ChNPS12 (Fig. 6, euascomycete ChNPS12
group 1) are present in both euascomycete and basidiomycete group 1 and have the same domain structure as
the C. heterostrophus NPS12 proteins (Fig. 6). Sister to
all group 1 NPS12-like proteins is a group of proteins
consisting of standalone A domains (Fig. 6, basidiomycete NPS12 group 2). These were found only in the
brown-rot heterokaryotic fungus, P. placenta, which carries eight closely related copies.
The monomodular bacterial NRPSs nested within the
ChNPS12/ETP module 2 subfamily also consist of a
standalone A domains. As noted earlier, for many bacterial NRPS systems (e.g., VibE, MxcE, and YbtE), single
A domains may be involved in NRPS biosynthesis by
activating and transferring the activated substrate to a
different NRPS [5]. Only one example of this type of
synthesis has been reported for fungi (e.g., C. purpurea
ergot alkaloid biosynthesis) [5,84], but our identification
of these single fungal A domains grouping with other
known NPRSs (e.g., ETP toxins) (Figs. 2, 6, Additional
file 6) suggests that this mechanism could be more common in fungi than previously appreciated.
The diversity of domain structures found within the
ChNPS11/ETP/ChNPS12 group leads us to hypothesize
that there may be several distinct functional groups
within this clade.
Multimodular NRPS subfamilies

The majority of multimodular NRPSs are found in the
SID and EAS subfamilies. These subfamilies group
together with high bootstrap support (>97%) in analyses
of the reduced dataset (Fig. 2). Analyses that included a
larger number of bacterial sequences (KE Bushley and
BG Turgeon, unpublished) support our phylogenetic
and distribution data that the SID and EAS subfamilies
are restricted to fungi. As noted above, two subfamilies
containing genes encoding multimodular NRPSs, the
CYCLO and ACV synthetases, group with the primarily
mono/bi-modular suite of NRPSs. (Table 1, Fig. 2). SID
synthetases show a relatively conserved domain architecture, are present in the majority of euascomycetes

Page 12 of 23

sampled, and are thought to have evolved by module
duplication and selective loss of A domains or complete
modules, as described in detail in Bushley et al. [65].
Diversity within the EAS subfamily

The EAS subfamily, in additional to containing the vast
majority of fungal NRPSs, also shows the greatest
diversity of both domain architecture and function
(Figs. 2, 7, Additional file 2). It includes proteins that
are both structurally and functionally conserved (e.g.
homologs of ChNPS6 which biosynthesize extracellular
siderophores), as well as those that are highly lineage
specific (e.g. HTS1 [51] and AMT [52] synthetases for
host selective toxins, Tex1 [85] and other peptaibol
synthetases, and ergot alkaloid synthetases). The highly
diverse domain architectures and discontinuous distribution of corresponding A domains make the identification of orthologs across species extremely
challenging.
ChNPS6/PerA: Perhaps the only group for which orthologs can be clearly identified are homologs of the most
conserved NRPS in the EAS clade, ChNPS6, which biosynthesizes an extracellular iron scavenging siderophore
that serves as a virulence factor for several fungi and is
also involved in combating oxidative stress [10,6] (Figs.
2, 6, 7). Although ChNPS6 appears to have undergone a
gene duplication event, it is single copy in all species
examined except Trichoderma reesii (Fig. 7), which contains two paralagous copies. All ChNPS6 homologs have
a highly conserved domain structure consisting of a single A-T-C module followed by a module with a degenerate A domain (dA-T-C) [10]. Sister to the ChNPS6
group is a clade containing both ChNPS8 and an Epichloe festucaeNRPS, PerA; the latter NRPS mediates
symbiotic interactions of E. festuca with its grass host by
producing an NRP insect deterrent, peramine [86] (Fig.
7, arrow).
Ergot alkaloid synthetases: NRPSs synthesizing ergot
alkaloids consistently grouped sister to the ChNPS6 and
ChNPS8/PerA clade but without bootstrap support
(Figs. 2, 7). These synthetases were found only in animal
pathogens in the Eurotiales and grass endophytes such
as C. purpurea (Figs. 2, 7). Given that grass endophytes
such as C. purpurea are thought to have an animal
pathogenic ancestor [87] and that their ergot alkaloid
NRP products have toxic effects on livestock and other
animals [88-91], we hypothesize that NRPSs synthesizing
ergot alkaloids originally evolved to function in animal
pathogenesis.
Peptaibol synthetases: Peptaibol synthetases, which were
restricted to the Hypocrealean taxa examined in this
study (Trichoderma/Hypocrea), also formed a well supported group. However, as discussed below, several
modules of each peptaibol synthetase group outside of
the main clade (Table 1, Figs. 2, 7)

Dothideomycete host-selective toxin synthetases: A
domains of the A. alternata apple pathotype-specific
AMT synthetase which produces the host-selective
toxin, AM toxin, grouped consistently with modules 1
and 3 of ChNPS1 and ChNPS3 (discussed below). Modules of tetramodular C. carbonum HTS1, responsible for
biosynthesis of another host selective toxin, the cyclic
tetrapeptide, HC-toxin, grouped in disparate locations in
the EAS clade such that clear homologs of HTS1 A
domains were not recognizable in any of the species in
our dataset (Figs. 2, 7).
ChNPS4: Both HTS1 and ChNPS4 A domain relationships exemplify the challenges of identifying orthologs
within the rapidly evolving EAS clade. ChNPS4 has been
shown to play a role in C. heterostrophus conidial cell
surface hydrophobicity and a homolog in the related
Dothideomycete Alternaria brassicicola plays a role in
conidial wall development and integrity [9]. Each of the
four A domains from each module of tetramodular
ChNPS4 groups with strong support with the corresponding A domains of tetramodular AbNPS1 in the
closely related Dothideomycete, A. brassicae. These A
domains group within a larger clade containing Metarhizium anisopliae NRPS PesA although without bootstrap support (Figs. 2, 7, Additional file 6). However, A
domains from NRPSs found in other euascomycetes that
group with each of the ChNPS4 modules contain from
two to six modules. While some of these A domains are
clearly related to those of ChNPS4, module duplication
and loss obscure the history of this group.
Evolutionary mechanisms giving rise to multimodular
NRPSs

The greater diversity of domain architectures seen in
multimodular NRPSs is likely due to the multiplicity of
evolutionary mechanisms which may generate the corresponding multimodular genes. The EAS subfamily, in
particular, contains NRPSs varying from monomodular
proteins involved in ergot alkaloid biosynthesis (PS2
and PS4) and ChNPS6 (which has one complete and
one degenerate A domain) to the eighteen module
TEX1 synthetase responsible for peptaibol biosynthesis
in Trichoderma virens (Hypocrea virens) [85] (Figs. 2,
7, Additional file 6). Several subgroups within the EAS
illustrate some of the mechanisms by which the diverse
domain architectures of multimodular NRPSs may
arise.
Tandem Duplication

Cyclosporin synthetase (SimA) is a clear example of tandem duplication of modules of an NRPS in a single species (Tolypocladium inflatum). All eleven A domains
from this protein group together as a single well supported monophyletic group (Fig. 2) which also includes
certain A domains from other fungal NRPSs, such as
ChNPS1 module 2 and ChNPS3 modules 2 and 4.

Page 14 of 23

Peptaibol synthetases illustrate a more complex process of tandem duplication of modules of an NRPS. Peptaibol synthetases are highly lineage specific and found
only within the Hypocreales to date. Using H. virens
TEX1 as a point of reference, we found that all modules
of TEX1 group together in three separate, well-supported clades with modules of two peptaibol synthetases
(Trire2_23171 and Trire2_123786) in the related species,
Trichoderma reesii (Figs. 2, 7). TEX1 module 13 falls
outside of the other two TEX1 clades (Figs. 2, 7, 8), The
nearly one-to-one relationship between modules of
TEX1 and modules of T. reesii Trire2_23171 suggests
that tandem duplication of modules giving rise to these
orthologous genes must have occurred prior to divergence of these two species (Fig. 8). However, at least
one additional internal duplication has occurred since
divergence from an ancestral species (e.g., note the relationship between T. reesii Trire2_23171 modules 18 and
19) (Fig. 8). The relationship of these two peptaibol
synthetases with the T. reesii 14 module peptaibol
synthetases, Trire2_123786 is less straightforward. However, we note that certain A domains from
Trire2_123786 modules 2, 6, and 11 form widowed
branches at the base of clades which contain A domains
of at least two, and more often, all three peptaibol
synthetases (Fig. 8, stippled boxes). We hypothesize that
these may be ancestral domains. Previous studies suggest that like T. reesii, T. virens also harbors additional
NRPSs involved in peptaibol biosynthesis [92].
Recombination

Two NRPSs found in C. heterostrophus, ChNPS1 and
ChNPS3, demonstrate the potential role of recombination and modular rearrangement in the generation of
multimodular NRPSs. Modules 1 and 3 of both ChNPS1
and ChNPS3 group within the EAS subfamily with
AMT synthetase, a lineage specific NRPS found only in
a single strain of related A. alternata [52] (Figs. 2, 7,
Additional file 6A-C). Module 2 of ChNPS1 and modules 2 and 4 of ChNPS3, however, group with the
CYCLO synthetases among the mono/bi-modular NRPS
subfamilies (Fig. 2, Additional file 6). The phylogenetically unlinked locations of ChNPS1 and ChNPS3 modules in the larger phylogeny suggests that a
recombination event must have given rise to the extant
genes in C. heterostrophus (Fig. 9). A domains of several
other euascomycete NRPSs, for example, bimodular
Fusarium equiseti Enniatin synthetase (FeESYN1) and
trimodular M. oryzae, MGG00022, also show recombinant structures. Module 1 A domains of both proteins
group in the EAS clade with the C. heterostrophus pseudogene ChNPS13, but without bootstrap support (Fig.
2), at positions distinct from modules 1 and 3 of
ChNPS1 and ChNPS3. The C-terminal A domain of
ESYN1 and the A domains of the final two modules of

Figure 8 Modular organization of Peptaibol synthetases and proposed evolution by tandem duplication. A domains from peptaibol
synthetases form three distinct, well-supported clades in the EAS subfamily (Fig. 7). A. Modular structure of the H. virens TEX 1 peptaibol
synthetase and two peptaibol synthetases in the related species, T. reesii (T.reesii 2_23171 and T.reesii 2_123786. Color coding corresponds to
clades identified in phylogenetic analyses (B and C, and Fig. 7). Arrows indicate bootstrap support for module relationships (B, C. and Fig. 7).
While T. reesii 2_23171 is clearly a homolog of TEX1, domain duplication of modules 18 to 19 or vice versa and addition of module 2 have
occurred since the common ancestor of these species. B. Two of the peptaibol synthetases clades (light green and dark blue, Fig. 7), group
together as a monophyletic group but without bootstrap support. A domains shown in stippled boxes indicate modules from T.reesii 2_123786
which do not have a clear counterpart in the other peptaibol synthetases and may represent ancestral domains. C. The third clade (purple, Fig.
7) groups in a distinct position within the EAS subtree.

MGG00022 group in the CYCLO clade (Figs. 2, 9), like
module 2 of ChNPS1 and modules 2 and 4 of ChNPS3.
Thus, homologs of modules of ChNPS1 and ChNPS3
appear in different combinations in other fungi and
demonstrate that recombination plays an important role
in the evolution of multimodular NRPSs.
Stability of NRPS gene copy number and domain
architectures across subfamilies

Many multigene families experience gene duplication
and loss and evolve by a birth-death process [93-96].
Variation in gene copy number resulting from gene
duplication and loss is thought to be influenced by both

functional and dosage requirements as well as random
processes such as genomic drift [43,44,97,98]. Recent
studies suggest that functionally conserved genes, such
as those involved in growth and development or other
basic cellular processes, tend to experience both less
variation in copy number [53] and more stable domain
organizations [49] than genes involved in environmental
and stress responses [53,99].
For multimodular genes such as NRPSs, duplication
and loss or birth-death evolution [93-95] can occur at
two hierarchical levels: 1) at the level of the whole gene,
and 2) at the level of domains within a gene (intragenic).

Figure 9 Phylogenetic groupings and modular organization of ChNPS1 and ChNPS3 showing recombinant structure of these NRPSs. A.
Modules 1 and 3 of both ChNPS1 and ChNPS3 group with AM toxin synthetase, a trimodular NRPS that biosynthesizes AM-toxin, an Alternaria
alternata host-selective toxin. B. Module 2 of ChNPS1 and modules 2 and 4 of ChNPS3 group with A domains (SimA) of cyclosporin synthetases
(CYCLO) in a disparate position in the larger phylogeny compared to modules 1 and 3 (A, above) which group in the EAS subfamily (Fig. 2). C.
Recombinant domain organization of ChNPS1 and ChNPS3. Blue boxes correspond to modules 2 and 4, purple boxes to modules 1 and 3. Note
that single modules homologous to these domains are found in other euascomycete NRPSs. For example, Enniatin synthetases (Esyn1) and
MGG00022.6 are also recombinant like ChNPS1 and ChNPS3 with one or more modules grouping with the cyclosporin subfamily (blue boxes)
and others also within the EAS subfamily but in a distinct position from the ChNPS1 and ChNPS3 modules (clear boxes). Cyclosporin synthetases
itself appears to have arisen by tandem duplication of SimA modules within T. inflatum.

In the latter case, genes encoding NRPSs whose products are involved in more conserved functions, such as
the AARs, would be expected to have more stable
domain architectures than those encoding proteins with
niche-specific functions. The latter may experience less
functional constraint allowing for flexible gain and loss
of domains leading to diversity of domain structures.
Because NRPS A domains are involved in substrate
selection [100,101], their loss or gain could result in a
rapid change in the chemical product of an NRPS.

The range of variation in copy number of NRPSencoding genes and in number of A domains/NRPS for
each subfamily is shown for Euascomycete taxa only in
Fig. 10. Variation in gene copy number is the highest
for the EAS subfamily but both the PKS;NRPS and
ChNPS12 subfamilies also show substantial variation
(Fig. 10A). The EAS subfamily also shows by far the
greatest variation in number of A domains/NRPS, followed by CYCLO and SID subfamilies, suggestive of less
stable domain architectures and higher rates of

Bushley and Turgeon BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:26
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/26

intragenic domain duplication for these three groups.
All of the remaining mono/bi-modular subfamilies show
remarkably conserved domain architectures (Fig. 5,
10B), supporting available functional data which suggests these groups may have more central conserved
roles in metabolism.
When we compared gene and domain duplication and
loss in different subfamilies across euascomycetes, no
particular subfamily showed significant evidence for
nonrandom expansion or contraction of number of
genes. When patterns of the total number of A domains
per subfamily were analyzed, the EAS subfamily was the
only group which showed highly significant (P < .00001)
deviation from a random birth-death process (data not
shown). These results support other observations that
gain and loss of domains is an important evolutionary
force within the EAS subfamily and may represent an
adaptive response to niche-specific environmental
pressures.

Figure 10 Number and range of NRPSs and A domains for
each subfamily. A. Average and range (lowest to highest) number
of NRPS-encoding genes in each subfamily per euascomycete
genome shows that the EAS subfamily has both the highest
average number of genes and the highest variation in copy number
among species. PKS;NRPSs and ChNPS12 subfamilies also have
substantial variation in numbers of NRPS-encoding genes among
species. B. Average and range (lowest to highest) of the number of
A domains/NRPS in euascomycete genomes for each subfamily
shows that the EAS subfamily also has by far the greatest variation
in number of A domains/NRPS followed by the CYCLO, and SID
subfamilies.

Chain termination mechanisms

Our survey revealed that fungal NRPSs have a variety of
C-terminal domains involved in chain termination. The
most common for multimodular NRPSs is a C domain
while for monomodular NRPSs it is an R domain (Additional file 2). R domains have previously been identified
and shown to play a role in peptide release in fungal
AARs [23,56], a number of fungal PKS;NRPSs [76-78],
and in a minority of bacterial NRPSs including SafA and
MxcG [20,21] and the PKS;NRPS hybrid, myxalamid
[22]. Some multimodular NRPSs, however, also have a
terminal R domain suggesting this may be a common
release mechanism for fungal NRPSs. (Additional file 2).
Two different release mechanisms have been identified
for R type domains in fungal NRPSs, indicating the possibility of R domains subtypes. In fungal AAR’s, the R
domain reduces the enzyme bound a-aminoadipic acid
[23]. The C-terminal R domain in the fungal PKS;
NRPSs for Equisetin biosynthesis (EqiS), however, catalyzes a Dieckmann condensation reaction, thus performing a function similar to bacterial TE domains [76].
Some mono- and some multi-modular NRPSs terminate
in T domains (Additional file 2) although these have not
been implicated previously in chain release.
As noted previously, bacterial NRPSs generally have a
TE domain at the C-terminal end for peptide release
but TE domains have been found only in a few fungal
NRPSs, notably the ACV synthetases [16]. We identified
several other fungal NRPSs (AN2621.4, FGSG_11989.3,
and Phchr1_2706), grouping with modules of Cyclosporin synthetase, which also contain a C-terminal TE
domain (Additional file 2). However, our data suggest
that TE domains are indeed rare in fungal NRPSs providing further support for the claims of horizontal transfer from bacteria to fungi of genes encoding ACV
synthetases, and possibly these other fungal genes with
TE domains.

Conclusions
Phylogenomic analysis identified nine major subfamilies
of fungal NRPSs which fall into two main groups: 1) a
group of primarily mono/bi-modular enzymes
(ChNPS10, AAR, ChNPS12, ChNPS11/ETP, PKS:NRPS,
and CYCLO subfamilies) that group with bacterial
NRPSs, and 2) a group of primarily multimodular proteins (EAS, SID) which appear both restricted to and
highly expanded within fungi. Analyses demonstrate that
a-aminoadipate reductases are more closely related to
NRPSs than to other adenylating enzymes and provide
further support for previous claims of horizontal transfer of certain NRPSs from bacteria to fungi. In addition,
phylogenomic relationships among subfamilies, taxonomic distributions, structural conservation of domain
architecture, and known data on function suggest that

Bushley and Turgeon BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:26
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/26

several of the mono/bi-modular groups are older in origin and play more central roles in cellular metabolism.
The highly expanded group of fungal multimodular
NRPSs, particularly the EAS subfamily, have less conserved domain architectures due to domain/module
duplication and loss, and tend to perform more nichespecific functions, typically considered the realm of “secondary” metabolites.

Methods
Identification of putative NRPSs in fungal genomes

A set of fungal NRPSs with known chemical products
was extracted from the NCBI database (Additional file
10), aligned using MUSCLE [102] with the 13 NRPSs
identified previously in the Dothideomycete, C. heterostrophus C4 strain [10], and used to construct an initial
HMMER model of fungal NRPS A domains using
HMMER 2.0 http://hmmer.janelia.org (Additional file
11). This model was tested for specificity and ability to
identify NRPSs proteins in fungal genomes for which
NRPSs have been well characterized (e.g., C. heterostrophus and Gibberella zeae/Fusarium graminearum) and
was found to correctly identify all known NRPSs in the
genomes of these species as top hits. Protein datasets of
a taxonomically representative sample of fungal genomes (Additional file 12) were downloaded and searched
using both a local and global version of the fungal NRPS
HMMER model. Proteins that were hit by our A domain
model with an e-value less than 1 were considered possible NRPSs. A similar search strategy was employed on
the nucleotide genome sequences using GENEWISE
[103] and the same HMMER model to identify candidates that might have been missed or mis-annotated by
automated gene calling programs. This approach did
not identify any additional genes but did identify missed
domains and also revealed a number of split gene annotations in the automated protein calls which we have
reannotated. These included BC1G09040_09041.1,
BC1G07441_07442.1,
and
FGSG11659.3
and
FGSG11630.3 which we conclude represents a single
gene corresponding to the MIPS and version 2 broad
annotation (FG_00042.1), (Additional file 2).
For each fungal genome, A domains from all candidate NRPSs were aligned, using MUSCLE [102], with A
domains from the 12 NRPSs previously identified from
C. heterostrophus [10] (Additional file 1) and with A
domains from related adenylating enzymes in the AMPbinding family (PFAM PF00501) [e.g., acyl CoA ligases
(ACoAL), acetyl CoA synthetases (ACoAS), acyl AMP
ligases (AAL), homologs of C. heterostrophus CPS1
(CPS1) [54], long chain fatty acid ligases (LCFAL), and
homologs of Ochratoxin synthetase (OCHRA) [104]
(Additional file 5). An initial phylogenetic analysis was

Page 18 of 23

conducted using the WAG+G model in PhyML to
define a set of candidate NRPS proteins for each genome. Proteins from each genome grouping within a
monophyletic group containing A domains of the
known C. heterostrophus NRPS proteins and separated
from the outgroup proteins with consistently high bootstrap support (>90), were retained in the dataset as candidate NRPSs or NRPS-like proteins. We chose to use
individual A domains, rather than to include only proteins containing a complete A-T-C module as has been
used in previous studies [105] because the latter would
miss several putative NRPS or NRPS-like proteins (e.g.
C. heterostrophus NPS10 and NPS12 [10]) that lack a
complete A-T-C module. In addition, freestanding A
domains in bacterial NRPSs have been shown to catalyze NRPS biosynthesis by activating and transferring
substrates in trans to separate NRPSs [5] and the evolutionary relationship between monomodular NRPS-like
proteins and multimodular NRPSs was also of interest.
Annotation of domain architectures

All candidate proteins were annotated with our initial
fungal NRPS A model and the PFAM models for C
(PF00668) and T (PF00550) domains. Using the domains
identified in the dataset from this search, a refined set of
fungal specific NRPS HMMER models was built for the
A (FungalNPSAMP.hmm), C (FungalNPSCON.hmm),
and T (FungalNPSTHIOL.hmm) domains (Additional
file 4). These models more accurately identified C and T
domains in NRPSs with known/manually curated annotations than the generic PFAM models and were thus
used to annotate A-T-C domain structures of all candidate fungal NRPSs. In addition, all candidate proteins
were used as queries against the PFAM and INTERPRO
domain databases to identify additional non-canonical
NRPS domains present in these proteins. A complete
domain architecture was compiled for each protein by
merging these two approaches (Additional file 2).
Phylogenomic analyses

Representatives of both fungal and bacterial adenylating
enzymes used as outgroups (Additional file 5) in identification of putative NRPSs were also used as outgroups
in phylogenomic analyses. While all AARs grouped as
putative NRPSs, to reduce the size of the dataset, only a
taxonomically representative sample of the fungal AARs
were included in the full phylogenetic analyses. Fungal
A domains from NRPSs with known function and/or
chemical products present in GenBank were also
included (Additional file 10). To select a diverse group
of bacterial proteins, a representative A domain of each
subfamily of fungal NRPSs was used to query the nr
protein database at NCBI and the top 5 bacterial protein
hits for each, as well as a number of bacterial proteins
with known chemical products, were selected

Bushley and Turgeon BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:26
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/26

(Additional file 8). The complete set of A domains were
extracted from these 58 bacterial proteins for a total of
99 A domains.
All candidate NRPS and outgroup A domains were
aligned with MUSCLE [102]. Portions of ambiguous
alignment were first adjusted manually and then masked
to remove columns in the alignment with > 30% gaps
prior to phylogenetic analysis (Additional file 13). A few
candidate A domains were partial (BC1G15479,
FG11319, AN8504, and Pa3740) and were removed
from the final analysis because they did not align well
with other NRPSs. ProtTest [106] was used to identify
an appropriate protein substitution matrix as it has been
shown that spurious choice of a matrix can lead to inaccurate phylogenies [107]. The RtREV+G+F model had
the best likelihood score for all criteria (AIC and BIC)
except for AIC-1 with sample size corrected for the
number of sites in the alignment, which identified WAG
+G as the best model. Three methods were used for
phylogeny construction: 1) Maximum likelihood (ML)
using RaxML [108] with the RtREV+G+F substitution
model, 2) ML using PhyML with the WAG+G model
[109], and 3) Neighbor joining (NJ) using NEIGHBOR
in PHYLIP [110] and a distance matrix created in
TREEPUZZLE [111] with the WAG+G substitution
model. We used a Gamma distribution with four rate
categories to model rate variation in all analyses. Bootstrapping was performed to assess the robustness of the
phylogeny. Bootstrap datasets of 500 replicates for ML
analysis and 200 replicates for the NJ analyses were created using SEQBOOT in PHYLIP and analyzed by the
respective methods.
Because bootstrap support has been observed to
decline in larger datasets [112-114], we also performed
analyses on a subset of the data containing representatives from each of the major subfamilies identified. This
dataset was aligned separately with MUSCLE and also
masked with slightly less stringent conditions to remove
columns containing greater than 50% gaps (Additional
file 14). Phylogenetic analyses were performed on this
dataset using the same methods described above.
Alignments have been deposited in TREEBASE
(http://www.treebase.org/treebase/index.html, Study
accession number = S2573 Matrix accession number =
M4916).
Subfamily identification and modelling

Fungal NRPS subfamilies were characterized as monophyletic groups defined by the most internal branch
from the root above a bootstrap cutoff level (we chose
70%) [115,116] that also shared identical taxon composition across all three phylogenetic methods and had fungal NRPS representation (Additional file 6). The SID
group was a single exception in that in the full phylogenies (Fig. 1, Additional file 6) maximum likelihood

Page 19 of 23

methods supported this clade with 68% and 74% bootstrap support while NJ did not provide support above
50% (Fig. 1, Additional file 6). This clade is, however,
supported by >80% bootstrap support in all phylogenetic
methods in analysis of the reduced dataset (Fig. 2, Additional file 7).
Distribution of NRPS subfamilies across fungal taxonomic
groups

To address patterns of distribution of NRPSs across fungal taxonomic groups, we tallied NRPS counts in Chytridiomycota,
Zygomycota,
Basidiomycota,
Schizosaccharomycota, Hemiascomycota, and Euascomycota. Fisher’s exact tests were used to test for associations between taxonomic groups and the proportion of
genes in each NRPS subfamily.
Lineage specific expansions and variation in birth-death
rates

We calculated and graphed the average and range of the
number of genes encoding NRPSs in each subfamily per
euascomycete genome and the number of A domains
per NRPS for each subfamily to assess broad patterns of
variation in numbers of genes and numbers of A
domains/gene across subfamilies (Fig. 10)
We used the method of Hahn et al. [117,118], which
applies a stochastic birth and death process along a phylogeny to test for statistically significant lineage specific
expansions and contractions of 1) number of NRPS
genes and 2) numbers of NRPS A domains/subfamily.
For these analyses, we created an ultrametric species
tree with the PL method in r8s [119] using the phylogeny of the concatenated protein dataset of Fitzpatrick
et al. [120] (Additional file 9).
We performed two separate analyses using CAFÉ
[118] to look at patterns of gene and A domain expansions. The first analysis looked at patterns of the total
number of NRPSs (e.g. all subfamilies combined) to
look for broad patterns of expansions and contractions
across the full tree of fungi (excluding B. dendrobatidis).
The second analysis analyzed duplications and losses in
each subfamily separately and was restricted to the euascomycete taxa because the birth-death model assumes
that at least one gene of each subfamily is present in the
common ancestor of all taxa. The ACV synthetase subfamily was excluded because parsimony inferred that
this family had zero genes at the root. For all analyses,
we used 1000 re-samplings and significant deviations
from a random birth-death model were determined by
viterbi p-values below .05.
