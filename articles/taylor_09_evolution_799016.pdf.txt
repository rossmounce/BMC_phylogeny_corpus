Abstract
Background: Endogenous derivatives of non-retroviral RNA viruses are thought to be absent or
rare in eukaryotic genomes because integration of RNA viruses in host genomes is impossible
without reverse transcription. However, such derivatives have been proposed for animals, plants
and fungi, often based on surrogate bioinformatic evidence. At present, there is little known of the
evolution and function of integrated non-retroviral RNA virus genes. Here, we provide direct
evidence of integration by sequencing across host-virus gene boundaries and carry out phylogenetic
analyses of fungal hosts and totivirids (dsRNA viruses of fungi and protozoans). Further, we
examine functionality by tests of neutral evolution, comparison of residues that are necessary for
viral capsid functioning and assays for transcripts, dsRNA and viral particles.
Results: Sequencing evidence from gene boundaries was consistent with integration. We detected
previously unknown integrated Totivirus-like sequences in three fungi (Candida parapsilosis,
Penicillium marneffei and Uromyces appendiculatus). The phylogenetic evidence strongly indicated that
the direction of transfer was from Totivirus to fungus. However, there was evidence of transfer of
Totivirus-like sequences among fungi. Tests of selection indicated that integrated genes are
maintained by purifying selection. Transcripts were apparent for some gene copies, but, in most
cases, the endogenous sequences lacked the residues necessary for normal viral functioning.
Conclusions: Our findings reveal that horizontal gene transfer can result in novel gene formation
in eukaryotes despite miniaturized genomic targets and a need for co-option of reverse
transcriptase.

Background
In eukaryotes, novel genes can be formed by alternative
splicing, exon shuffling, horizontal gene transfer and
inserted retroelements [1,2]. Indeed, many eukaryotic
genomes are bloated with the raw materials (introns and
retroelements) for these processes [3-5]. In most budding
yeasts, however, the source of novel gene formation is
obscure as there is a dearth of spliceosomal introns (< 5%
of genes and < 0.5% of the genome) and retroelement

products (< 3% of genome size) [6-8]. Although duplication of existing genes is common in budding yeasts, de
novo gene formation and the horizontal gene transfer
(HGT) appear stifled by the architecture of miniaturized
genomes [7,9]. It is surprising, then, that NCBI Genbank
annotations (EU380679 from this study, CAR65487,
ABN68085, and ABN68086) and the BLAST-based study
of Frank and Wolfe [10] reveal significant matches of yeast
genes to the non-retroviral dsRNA viruses Saccharomyces

cerevisiae L-A (L1) virus (Totiviridae). Debaryomyces hansenii has two capsid (Cp)-like genes, while Pichia stipitis has
at least four Cp-like genes; each fungus has a single RNA
dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)-like gene [10].
Endogeny is common for viruses that either encode their
own reverse transcriptase (retroviruses and pararetroviruses) or are already DNA-based [11-13] but fragments of
integrated non-retroviral viral RNA have rarely been proposed [14-16]. As the integration of non-retroviral RNA
viruses into DNA-based eukaryotic genomes requires the
co-option of reverse transcriptase [17], Holmes [12] called
this type of transfer 'one of the most remarkable observations in viral evolution of recent years'.
Little is known of the biology of non-retroviral integrated
RNA viruses (NIRVs). We are unaware, for example, of
evolutionary or functional comparisons among NIRVs.
Even the initial bioinformatic evidence of NIRVs is often
weak as genome assemblies can be contaminated or incorrectly annotated and surrogate (non-phylogenetic) analyses are susceptible to false positives [18-20]. The proposed
transfer of bacterial genes into the human genome, for
example, disappeared with a detailed phylogenetic analysis [21]. The initial claims of NIRVs in grape (Vitus)
genomes also failed the direct tests of integration [22].
Direct evidence of NIRVs is provided by the successful
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification or
sequencing across host and integrated virus gene boundaries [14]. Where HGT is strongly supported, BLAST-based
analyses of genes with open reading frames cannot adequately discern the direction of the transfer (from host to
virus or from virus to host). The dsRNA elements that
code for killer toxins in some fungi appear to have a cellular origin based on structural similarities to cellular genes
and, in some cases, the preservation of vestigial polyA
sequences at internal positions of the viral plus strands
[23]. However, another BLAST-based study concluded
that significant sequence matches with cellular genes and
the presence of cellular pseudogenes indicated the transfer
from killer dsRNA element to cellular genome [10]. The
resolution of the question of directionality and the determination of HGT requires phylogenetic evidence with
strong support and adequate sampling of interacting
organisms [18].
Nor can functional maintenance of suspected HGT genes
be inferred solely from a putative open reading frame recent pseudogenes can produce a similar pattern [24].
Evolutionary analysis of selection and analysis of transcription products can provide stronger evidence of functional maintenance. Though negative evidence, a lack of
viral products (dsRNA or viral particles), might hint at a
novel function in a NIRV. Further evidence can be provided by the comparative analysis of functional landmarks. For example, the capsid gene of the Totivirus (L1-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/88

LA) functions to remove m7GMP caps from fungal host
mRNAs [25,26]. Site directed mutational experiments
have revealed eight residues that are essential for this
decapping function [25,26]. Alteration of these residues
in an integrated viral Cp gene would provide evidence for
novel function. In the present study we carry out phylogenetic, evolutionary and functional analyses to test the
hypothesis of NIRVs, the direction of HGT and the
hypothesis that HGT of non-retroviral RNA viruses results
in novel functioning genes in the fungal-Totiviridae system.
Totivirids are simple dsRNA viruses defined by the presence of the RdRp and the single capsid polypeptide (Cp)
on a single dsRNA [27]. The isometric virions are about 40
nm in diameter. Inheritance of these intracellular RNA
viruses is normally vertical (no cellular genomic copies of
the dsRNA genomes are present)[28] but horizontal transfer can occur across fungal hyphae [27]. Confirmed intracellular totivirid infections are known only from fungi
and pathogenic protozoans (Leishmania, Giardia and Trichonomas). The totivirids in smut and yeast have been
assigned to the genus Totivirus, whereas totivirids infecting
filamentous fungi have been assigned to the genus Victorivirus [29]. Here, we provide independent direct evidence
that Totivirus-like genomes are integrated into the cellular
genomes of yeast that lack Totivirus infections and phylogenetic evidence that genes of Totivirus-like viruses have
been transferred to the genomes of four yeast species.
Moreover, the endogenous Totivirus-like genes appear to
be functionally maintained with non-viral functions and
may have been further transferred between deeper yeast
lineages.

Results and discussion
BLAST analysis using the RdRp and Cp protein sequences
of the S. cerevisiae virus La (L-Bc) as a query, detected Totivirus-like genes in five fungal species. We found RdRp-like
sequences in P. stipitis, Penicillium marneffei, D. hansenii
and Uromyces appendiculatus, and Cp-like sequences in P.
stipitis, P. marneffei, D. hansenii, and Candida parapsilosis.
The U. appendiculatus match is from an Expressed
Sequence Tags (EST) database. The D. hansenii virus-like
genome has two overlapping reading frames, as in the
exogenous viral architecture of the S. cerevisiae L1 virus
(ScVL1 or ScVL-A; Figure 1; [10]. The overlap is 138 bases
and the RdRp-like gene can be translated as a minus one
(-1) programmed ribosomal frameshift with the slippery
site, GGGUUUA [30,31], as in ScVL1. The P. stipitis viruslike genes encode a Cp-RdRp fusion protein, and has a
similar architecture to that found in the Ustilago maydis
P1H1 virus UmV [32]. The P. marneffei genome also
appears to contain a Totivirus-like genome (Figure 2). Here
the overlap between the CP-like gene and the RdRp-like
gene is 141 bases, but the slippery site that would allow a

minus one translation has been altered by a point mutation (GGAUUUA), suggesting a non-viral function. No
nonviral-like sequence is available from existing contigs
of P. marneffei, so further sequencing would be needed in
order to confirm the fungal flanking regions. For C. parapsilosis, it is clear that only a Cp-like sequence is present on
the large contig where we detected a Totivirus-like gene
(Figure 2).
We tested for the presence of DNA copies of dsRNA Totivirus-like genes by PCR amplification of fungal DNA extractions with specific primers (Figure 1). The first assay,
targeting the RdRp-Cp boundary, revealed an expected
PCR product size from both P. stipitis (488 bp) and D.
hansenii (1172 bp), while S. cerevisiae, which possesses
only viral dsRNA targets, lacked a detectable PCR product.
This result suggests that DNA-based genes matching the
viral sequences are present in D. hansenii and P. stipitis
cells. We then tested for fungal integration of these genes
by PCR amplification and DNA sequencing across the
proposed fungal-viral genome boundaries. We sequenced

the RdRp-fungus and upstream Cp-fungus boundaries for
each fungal species (Figure 1). The experimental
sequences have 100% matches with the proposed yeast
genome assemblies containing both the expected yeast
and the viral-like sequences. A direct test of the integration
in the remaining three fungi where we detected Totiviruslike sequences is pending.
The fungal RdRp-like sequences form a close, and strongly
supported, derived group within the viral RdRp gene tree
(Figure 3). Thus, the data satisfy the phylogenetic criterion
of horizontal transfer - a strongly supported phylogenetic
incongruence between interacting organisms [18]. As
many fungal genomes are now known, the close association of the viral-like RdRp gene in hemiascomycetous
yeast (P. stipitis and D. hansenii) with the RdRp gene of
exogenous Totivirus of other hemiascomycetes, such as S.
cerevisiae (Figures 3-4), is unlikely to be a sampling artifact
or a differential gene loss of Totivirus-like genes in fungi.
Instead, the placement of virus-like fungal sequences at
the tips of the totivirid tree indicates that the endogenous
forms in hemiascomycetes evolved from Totivirus and not
from fungal genomes. The Totivirus-like genes of P. marneffei, a Euascomycote (Additional File 1), are also nested
within the hemiascomycete clade and are most closely
related to D. hansenii. The presence of closely related Totivirus RdRp-like sequences in fungi from two divergent
clades suggests the occurrence of multiple integration
events or horizontal transfers among yeasts. The position
of the fungal sequences within the hemiascomycete virus
clade suggests that integration occurred first in hemiascomycetes and was transferred to P. marneffei. Further evidence of homology of NIRVs might be provided by
similarity of chromosomal regions flanking the insertion
site. However, even the most closely related fungi in our
study have undergone extensive chromosomal rearrangements. Jeffries et al. [8] found no orthologous chromosomal segments between the center of CHR 7 in P. stipitis
and chromosome B of D. hansenii, the locations of the
NIRVs. The fungal gene tree (Additional File 1) reveals
that the fungal species with endogenous Totivirus-like
genes, save P. marneffei, belong to the Clavispora clade
[33], which has Candida lusitaniae as the representative
species. The Clavispora clade, which has sometimes been
called the Candida clade [9] and is characterized by a shift
in genetic code, is estimated to be at least 100 million
years old [33].
The Cp gene tree also revealed a close relationship of the
endogenous viruses to the Totivirus of Hemiascomycotes
(Figure 4). BLAST matches are apparently limited to the
genus Totivirus because the Cp gene has evolved more
rapidly than the RdRp gene (Figures 3-4). The two copies
of Cp-like genes within D. hansenii have a sister relationship (amino-acid p-distance = 0.060) and represent either

recent paralogous duplication or concerted evolution.
However, the four copies of Cp-like genes in P. stipitis are
much more divergent with the average amino p-distance
between Cp1 and the other Cp copies in Pichia at 0.755.
The tandem positioning of two to four divergent Cp gene
copies and the monophyly of the fungal viral-like genes is
consistent with the hypothesis of endogenous tandem
duplication after integration by a Totivirus-like dsRNA
viral lineage. Interestingly, the ancestral viral genomic
architecture appears intact in P. stipitis (similar to UmV,
see above)D. hansenii (similar to ScVL1) and P. marneffei
which further supports the viral genome transfer hypothesis and permits the diagnosis of the ancestral integrated
gene in the Cp-like gene family (Figures 1-2). Alternative
scenarios, where Totivirus genomes are repeatedly and
faithfully duplicated in toto or are independently integrated at the identical regions in these fungal genomes, are
unlikely.
Under the scenario of endogeny we expect patterns of
DNA substitutions to differ between exogenous viral and
integrated fungal gene copies. A disparity index revealed

that fungal sequences do differ from viral sequences in
patterns of DNA substitution more than is expected from
evolutionary distance or from chance alone (Additional
File 2). Apart from the Cp1 sequence in P. stipitis, there
were no significant differences among disparity indices
within the fungal sequences or within the viral sequences.
Thus, our sequencing of gene boundaries and the substitution patterns are consistent with integrated fungal copies of dsRNA Totivirus-like genes.
Despite pronounced sequence divergence, each of the
Totivirus-like fungal genes had an uninterrupted open
reading frame (Figures 1-2). By searching the translated
EST database for Pichia with the RdRp amino acid
sequence (tBLASTn), we found that the RdRp mRNA
product appears as a normal, polyadenylated RNAPII
transcript in EST libraries (FE843929.1 and FE843928.1).
Similarly, we found matching RNAPII transcripts of at
least two of the Cp genes, Cp2 (FE851263.1 and
FE851264.1) and Cp4 (FE849285.1 and FE849284.1) in
P. stipitis. In order to test whether the endogenous genes
are evolving as functional genes, we calculated pairwise

and phylogenetic tests of neutral evolution (Table 1; Figure 5). Each of the comparisons for endogenous fungal
genes revealed a significant departure from neutrality in
the direction of purifying selection, consistent with purifying selection to maintain gene function (Table 1; Figure
5).
As we found evidence for viral genome architecture in our
PCRs (Figures 1 and 6A), we examined if the endogenous
genes functioned as in dsRNA viruses. We failed to detect
dsRNA products (Figure 6B) or viral particles (empty or
full) in P. stipitis and in D. hansenii (Figure 6C). This contrasts with the positive detection of dsRNA and viral particles in the Totivirus containing cells of S. cerevisiae. A
reverse transcriptase PCR (RTPCR) experiment revealed
no detectable transcripts of the complete endogenous
Totivirus genomes in D. hansenii or in P. stipitis (targets
include the Cp-RdRp boundary, Figure 6D). Notably,
RTPCR with oligonucleotide primers targeting only the
RdRp region did contain transcripts (Figure 6E). RNA
from the Totivirus-containing S. crevisiae does give an
RTPCR product from the Cp-RdRp region. These results
indicate that endogenous gene transcription proceeds differently than in Totivirus, as the integrated RdRp sequences
in D. hansenii and in P. stipitis initiate within the Cp

sequence, creating a subgenomic mRNA. Further, six to
seven of eight biochemically-conserved residues that are
important to the decapping function for Totivirus Cp genes
[25,26] are altered in three of the endogenous Cp-like
genes of P. stipitis (Figure 7).
Taken together, the functional and comparative evidence
suggests that the endogenous viral proteins have been coopted for cellular functions. The abandonment of viral
expression is also indicated by the absence of recognizable
RNA pseudoknot structure, following the slippery site in
the Totivirus-like genomes of Pichia and P. marneffei, and
by the absence of recognizable proteinase cleavage sites or
proteinase active site motifs in the Cp-RdRp overlap
region of D. hansenii. Co-option of integrated DNA viruses
and retroviruses by multicellular eukaryotes is well known
but rare [34]. An integration mechanism that co-opts
endogenous RNA integration machinery is plausible as
yeast genomes contain retroelements [9,35]. However, the
signature of retroelements is not obvious in the flanking
regions of the present integrations, perhaps as a result of
evolutionary divergence.
The evolutionary distribution and stabilization of NIRVs
is poorly understood. Opportunities for NIRV formation

should be greater in host taxa that have evolved a longstanding (presumably hypovirulent) non-retroviral virus
infection, as in the fungi-Totivirus or the dipteran-flavivirus associations. However, the Clavispora clade, which we
identify as the source of the yeast NIRVs, appears to lack
such infections with Totivirus. Given the widespread taxonomic distribution of Totivirus-like infections in fungi and
their absence in Clavispora [29], it is tempting to invoke
the shift in genetic code as a contributor to the loss of
infectionby Totivirus. Holmes [12] proposed that shifts in
genetic codes are evolutionary responses by the host to
RNA-based viral infections. NIRVs could have initially
played a beneficial role to the host by imparting resistance
to exogenous viruses. Indeed, there is experimental evidence in the yeast-Totivirus system that overproduction of
the capsid protein [36] or production of fragments of the
capsid protein[37] will interfere with packaging of the
virus and result in its loss. Such interference is also welldocumented with plant viruses [38]. The apparent
genomic prevalence of capsid-like NIRVs compared to
RdRp-like NIRVs (Figures 1 and 2) is consistent with this
interference hypothesis. In either case, the NIRVs that we
find in the Clavispora clade today could represent the vestiges of a co-evolutionary victory by the host.

Conclusions
We conclude that novel eukaryotic gene families have
originated from non-retroviral RNA viruses. NIRVs and
their transitional stages are archived in eukaryotic
genomes and appear more important to yeast evolution
than previously thought.

Methods
Cell cultures
We obtained lyophilized powders of P. stipitis strain
CBS6054 [8] from T Jeffries, Debaryomyces hansenii strain
CBS767 [6] from Jean-Luc Souciet and Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain S7 from C McLaughlin [39], which has the S.
cerevisiae virus L1 (LA) and the minor virus La (LB-C) but
no satellite virus. Cells were streaked on YPD agar (yeast
extract 1%, peptone 2%, and dextrose 2%) and single colonies were transferred to 150 ml of YPD broth.
Nucleic acid and viral particle extractions
RNA was extracted from cells with the Masterpure Yeast RNA
extraction kit (Epicentre, WI, USA). DNA was extracted using
a standard SDS/phenol/chloroform protocol. Viral dsRNA
was isolated by CF11 chromatography from crude RNA
preparations [40]. Empty viral particles of density 1.33 g/cc
were isolated as described [41], except that polyethylene glycol precipitation was replaced by high-speed pelleting of
viral particles (100,000 × g for 1.5 h).
PCR, RTPCR and DNA sequencing
Fifty microlitre PCR reactions contained 5 μL of extracted
DNA template, 10× PCR buffer [50 mM KCl, 1.5 mg
MgCl2, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.3, 0.01% (w/v) gelatin], 2
mM of each dNTP, 1 μM of each primer and 1 unit of Taq
DNA polymerase. Primers are listed in Additional File 3.
The PCR temperature profiles were: 30 cycles of 94°C for
30 s; 55°C for 30 s; 72°C for 2 min; and final extension at
72°C for 5 min. RT-PCR detection of viral transcripts and

mM Tris-acetate and 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.3) stained with
ethidium bromide (1 mg/l). DNA was sequenced by
Sanger methods at the University of Washington High

dom) [42]. We carried out maximum likelihood analyses
with RAxML using the RTREV substitution matrix, estimated AA frequencies, a gamma parameter for among-site
rate variation, and an invariable sites parameter [43]. For
bootstrapping, RAxML estimated the number of pseudoreplicates. For Bayesian analysis, we used Mr Bayes [44]
with an amino acid substitution model prior of RTREV
with a setting of rates = INVGAMMA. After 1 million
Markov chain Monte Carlo generations and confirming
convergence (average standard deviation of split frequencies < 0.01 and a plot of log likelihood scores with generation), we culled a burn-in set of 10,000 trees and
calculated the posterior probabilities. Trees were midpoint rooted.

Bioinformatics
We obtained the initial sequences of RdRp (Additional
File 4) and capsid (Additional File 5) genes from totivirids
by BLASTp of the nr peptide sequence database (National
Center for Biotechnology Information, Bethesda, USA)
with the protein sequences of S. cerevisiae virus La (L-BC)
and a cut-off of E<0.01. Additional genomic copies of Totivirus-like genes were identified by significant tBLASTx hits
(E<0.05) of relevant NCBI BLAST databases using the
sequences of S. cerevisiae virus La (L-BC). For the capsid
proteins the entire sequences were used and, for RdRp, the
contiguous conserved region [27] was used. Sequences
were aligned using Prank: probabilistic alignment kit with
the Pranskter graphical interface (Goldman Group, European Bioinformatics Institute, Cambridge, United King-

For the phylogeny of yeasts, we used the five genes (Additional File 6) with the greatest number of strong reliability
values from the list of the best 10 performing genes for
recovering fungal phylogeny (as determined by a genomescale analysis [45] for topological correctness). For fungi,
orthologous nuclear genes with strong support values for
a given node (bootstrap > 90 and posterior probabilities >
0.95) rarely disagree [46,47]. We chose species from
FUNYBASE [48] that had all of the genes of interest, and
added genomic sequences from an additional species of
Schizosaccharomyces, and from three genomes where we
detected totivirid-like sequences (Additional File 1; a
fourth genome with totivirid sequences, D. hansenii was
already part of FUNYBASE). Concatenated sequences
were aligned in MAFFT [49] and then exposed to culling

grated RNA virus; PCR: polymerase chain reaction; RdRp:
RNA dependant RNA polymerase; RTPCR: reverse transcriptase PCR.

A test of the homogeneity of substitution patterns
between viral and fungal sequences for the Cp-like genes
was carried out in MEGA4 [51]. We used the Disparity
Index test [52] with P-values estimated from 1000 Monte
Carlo based replicates (Additional File 2). The most divergent sequence (S. cerevisiae virus La (L-BC)) and the shortest sequence (C. parapsilosis) were culled for this analysis
because we wanted to retain informative alignment positions when gapped sites are completely deleted. After
positions with gaps and missing data were eliminated a
dataset of 1446 positions was retained.

Authors' contributions

Tests of neutral evolution for the Cp-like gene copies in
fungi were carried out in MEGA4. The test statistic is (dN dS) where dS and dN are the numbers of synonymous and
nonsynonymous substitutions per site, respectively. The
variance of the difference was computed using the bootstrap method (500 replicates). Analyses were conducted
using the Kumar method in MEGA4 [51]. Ka/Ks ratios
were calculated by the Ka/Ks calculator http://serv
ices.cbu.uib.no/tools/kaks and plotted on a tree using the
methods of [53]. GC content was estimated from the
alignment. The ratio of nonsynonymous (Ka) to synonymous (Ks) nucleotide substitution rates is an indicator of
selective pressures on genes. A ratio of less than one indicates selective pressure to conserve protein sequence. Note
that values are averaged over sites.
