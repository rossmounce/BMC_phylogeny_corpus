Abstract
Background: Marsupial syndactyly is a curious morphology of the foot found in all species of
diprotodontian and peramelemorph marsupials. It is traditionally defined as a condition in which
digits II and III of the foot are bound by skin and are reduced. Past treatments of marsupial
syndactyly have not considered the implications of this unique morphology for broader issues of
digit development and evolution, and the ongoing debate regarding its phylogenetic meaning lacks
a broad empirical basis. This study undertakes the first interdisciplinary characterisation of
syndactyly, using variance/covariance matrix comparisons of morphometric measurements,
locomotor indices, ossification sequences, and re-assessment of the largely anecdotal data on the
phylogenetic distribution of tarsal/metatarsal articulations and "incipient syndactyly".
Results: Syndactylous digits have virtually identical variance/covariance matrices and display
heterochronic ossification timing with respect to digits IV/V. However, this does not impact on
overall locomotor adaptation patterns in the syndactylous foot as determined by analysis of
locomotor predictor ratios. Reports of incipient syndactyly in some marsupial clades could not be
confirmed; contrary to previous claims, syndactyly does not appear to impact on tarsal bone
arrangement.
Conclusion: The results suggest that marsupial syndactyly originates from a constraint that is
rooted in early digit ontogeny and results in evolution of the syndactylous digits as a highly
integrated unit. Although convergent evolution appears likely, syndactyly in Diprotodontia and
Peramelemorpha may occur through homologous developmental processes. We argue that the
term "syndactyly" is a misnomer because the marsupial condition only superficially resembles its
name-giving human soft-tissue syndactyly.

Background
The occurrence of homoplasy is problematic in phylogenetic reconstruction and the tracing of morphological
evolution [1,2]. This is particularly the case when the evolution of a homoplastic trait is perceived as relatively com-

plex and therefore deemed unlikely to have evolved more
than once. A classic example that has sustained nearly two
centuries of controversial and often heated debate is the
character of marsupial syndactyly. This is commonly
defined as a peculiar phenotype in which digits II and III

of the marsupial foot are tightly connected by a common
sheath of skin at least to the base of the intermediate phalanx [3,4]. The trait occurs in all species of two Australasian marsupial orders (Fig. 1), Peramelemorpha (bilbies
and bandicoots; 21 species) and Diprotodontia (koalas,
wombats, possums, kangaroos, and allies; approx. 141
species). Together, these two clades represent nearly 50%
of marsupial species [5], Diprotodontia being the most
ecologically and locomotorily diverse extant marsupial
clade [6,7].
Marsupial syndactyly was one of the first characters used
for marsupial classification, [8-12]. It has been reasoned
that a character as complex as syndactyly could have only
evolved once within marsupials [8,12-16], and peramelemorphs and diprotodontians were commonly grouped
in the clade of Syndactyla [11,16,17]. Famously, this was
at odds with the division of marsupials based on dentition
into "diprotodont" (including Diprotodontia, and sometimes Paucituberculata, which possess two large procumbent
incisors)
and
"polyprotodont"
clades
[peramelemorphs and all other marsupial clades
[6,10,18]]. However, with the advent of molecular systematics, it became widely accepted [with some exceptions; [16,19]] that Diprotodontia and Peramelemorpha
are not sister groups [20-23]. As Figure 1 shows, this
arrangement favours homoplastic origins of syndactyly in
Peramelemorpha and Diprotodontia [18,21,23-25].

However, there have also been suggestions that syndactyly
may be plesiomorphic for larger marsupial clades, and has
subsequently been lost in some clades [23,26,27].
As a matter of course, it has been assumed that marsupial
syndactyly arose under selective pressure, but what the
functional relevance of syndactyly is has never been convincingly argued. A number of researchers suggested that
the comparatively small size ("reduction") of syndactylous digits in most species is related to arboreal locomotion in putatively arboreal ancestors of the syndactylous
clades [13,28,29]. This scenario has been contested
because arboreal Diprotodontia have particularly strongly
developed syndactylous digits [3,30]. A second hypothesis suggests that the function of syndactylous digits as
"grooming digits" confers a selective advantage
[3,11,18,31]. However, grooming organs are common
among placental mammals without comparable extensive
transformations in pedal morphology [3,13]. As such, the
adaptive implications of marsupial syndactyly remain elusive. However, it has never been considered that it is a
unique phenomenon with implications transcending its
local importance. No extant tetrapod clade displays a trait
which, without a clear-cut locomotor function, impacts as
heavily and consistently on autopodial morphology of an
ecologically diverse order. Such exceptions have the
potential to inform our understanding of evolutionary
and developmental patterns of tetrapod autopodial evolution [32], but little empirical information exists on syndactyly, which stems mainly from a few older dissectionbased studies [3,33-35]. As such, syndactyly displays some
intriguing but largely unexplored characteristics. For
example, syndactyly is not an exclusively soft-tissue
related condition but majorly affects the digits (Fig. 2).
The characteristic morphology of digits II and III suggests
that they evolve as a distinct unit within the syndactylous
foot [4], but this has never been tested. The result of the
unusual anatomy of syndactylous digits is that digit III
never forms the main axis of the foot in syndactylous marsupials [36], which is rare among tetrapods [37,38].
Instead, the marginal digits IV and V are extensively developed, while digits II and III are considered "reduced"
[13,31]. Nevertheless, locomotion in syndactylous marsupials (particularly Diprotodontia) is more diverse than in
all other marsupials and many placental orders, catering
for plantigrade terrestrial walking and bounding, grasping
arboreal locomotion, and the unique hopping gait of kangaroos; this is also reflected in pedal diversity (Fig. 2).
However, patterns of functional adaptation in the syndactylous foot and particularly of digits II and III remain to be
explored. Marsupial syndactyly is also apparent very early
in pedal development, which has lead to the as yet
untested suggestion of heterochronic change of foot
development in syndactylous species [13]. This is an interesting suggestion because heterochronic change in early

Page 2 of 14

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:160

ontogeny can help to explain evolutionary transformations of morphological traits [39-41]. Lastly, contextualisation of syndactyly in an evolutionary framework is to
date impossible because the evidence regarding its distribution has not been comprehensively assessed; two lines
of evidence have been deemed important in this respect.
A range of didelphid species have been termed "incipiently syndactylous" (Table 1). This has been considered
evidence that syndactyly may be more plesiomorphic
within marsupials than has been generally recognized
[23,26,42], although the existence of incipient syndactyly
has been contested [30,42,43]. Contrary to this hypothesis, it was suggested that tarsal/metatarsal articulation patterns in peramelemorphs, which differ from the
plesiomorphic mammalian condition, are a consequence
of convergent acquisition of syndactyly [8,15].
Characterizing Syndactyly
This study approaches marsupial syndactyly from several
angles. First, we test the notion that digits II and III evolve
as a distinct unit within the syndactylous foot. This is
done through assessment of inter-digit integration patterns of morphometric measurements across the diversity
of syndactylous marsupials, using a comparison of variance/covariance and correlation matrices. A morphometric approach is also taken to explore the impact of
marsupial syndactyly on pedal diversity and functional
adaptation. In addition, comparative analysis of ossification sequence in the digits [44-46] is employed to assess
the proposition that syndactyly arises through heterochronic change in pedal digit development [13]. Lastly, a
review and acquisition of new broad-scale comparative
data on external didelphimorph pedal digit morphology,
as well as marsupial tarsal articulations, are employed for
empirical qualification of previous hypotheses regarding
incipient syndactyly and the influence of syndactyly on
tarsal morphology.

Using this combination of morphometric, external morphological, and ontogenetic approaches, we address
issues regarding the nature, origins, and evolutionary
implications of marsupial syndactyly: What are the evolu-

tionary characteristics of digit relationships in syndactylous marsupials? Are these patterns related to
heterochronic changes in pedal digit development? Does
syndactyly impact on pedal diversity and functional adaptation? Does a reassessment of traditionally used indicators of syndactyly result in a better understanding of its
evolution? The results are synthesized into an integrated
view of marsupial syndactyly as a unique phenomenon in
tetrapod autopodial evolution.

Results
Correlation matrix comparisons
Morphometric raw data are shown in Additional file 1.
Variance/Covariance (v/cv) and correlation matrix correlations are listed in Table 2. Matrix repeatabilities (listed
in the diagonals of Table 2) are mostly over 0.9, suggesting low sampling error. One exception are the repeatabilities for v/cv matrices of digits II and III which are
considerably lower (this is probably due to size variation,
which is greater than in the remaining digits). This is likely
an underestimate since the lower repeatabilities for these
digits lead to over-adjustment of their raw v/cv matrix correlations (which is very high; 0.96) to a correlation value
over 1. The highest matrix correlations reported by both
analyses are those between digits II and III. Medium to
high correlations are reported for comparisons of digit V
with all other digits, while matrices of digits IV compared
with digits II and III have the lowest correlations. Variance/covariance matrix correlations are consistently
higher that correlation matrix comparisons, except in
comparisons between the syndactylous digits. This difference might be due to the scaling effect on the non-size
adjusted data resulting from division by the standard
deviation in the correlation approach [47].

The correlations between raw lengths are significantly
stronger between phalangeal elements of digits II and III
compared to those of digits II or III with digits IV or V
(Table 3). Regressions of raw measurements of corresponding digit elements show that this is due to a virtually
isometric relationship between digits II and III as evidenced by regression slopes close to 1, with very low

arboreal species have longer and more gracile phalanges
(see also Figure 2a, b), as demonstrated by higher phalangeal indices, metatarsal slenderness ratios (SRs), distal
SRs, and proximal SRs of digits IV and V compared to
quadrupedal terrestrial ones. Metatarsal SRs are highest in
peramelemorphs and macropodoid species, reflecting
their elongate metatarsals (see also Figs. 2c, d).
Kruskal-Wallis tests of locomotor index ratios in digit
pairs shows that most between-digit relationships are significantly different between locomotor types. Exceptions
are ratios between digits II and III, and all between-metatarsal ratios. The follow-up Wilcoxon test (Additional file
2) is significant for most inter-digit relationships between
all three groups, reflecting the markedly different relative
digit lengths in species of different locomotor type.
Digit ossification sequences
Ossification ranks for each species are presented in Additional file 3. In non-syndactylous marsupials, phalangeal
elements of one row (e.g. proximal, intermediate) occur
simultaneously in digits II-IV (Fig. 4a). In syndactylous
marsupials (Fig. 4b), the majority of phalangeal row ossification sequences are disassociated in time: digit IV is earliest to ossify in a row, in most cases simultaneous with or
followed by digit V. Then follow ossification of digits II

Regression results of raw length regressions between corresponding digit elements. Note that elements of digits II and III are close to identical in
length in all species as shown by intercepts near 0 and slopes close to 1 with very little error. This is also reflected in tight correlations between
digits II and III, which are nearly all significantly stronger than any other between-digit correlations (the relatively weaker results in metatarsals

and III (Fig. 4b). Ossification onsets for digit I are slightly
more variable, and metatarsals ossify at the same time in
all species except for Cercartetus concinnus (Fig. 4b). Parsimov analysis of the ossification data, using the consensus
of ACCTRAN and DELTRAN optimized apomorphy list
inputs, identifies two heterochronic shifts responsible for
the rank changes: firstly, an acceleration of intermediate
phalanges of digits IV and V with respect to proximal and
intermediate phalanges of digits II and III (see Fig. 5 for an
example), and secondly, acceleration of distal phalanges
IV and V with respect to distal phalanges II and III.
Tarsal bone anatomy and "incipient syndactyly"
All marsupial species examined, except peramelemorphs,
show metatarsal-tarsal articulations that correspond to
the plesiomorphic mammalian pattern (Fig. 2a–c). Digits
II and III articulate with the mesocuneiform and ectocuneiform bone, respectively, in all marsupials, while in peramelemorphs, digit III articulates perceptibly less with the
ectocuneiform. Digit IV is mostly supported by the cuboid
in all species except peramelemorphs, where it is supported partially by the ectocuneiform and cuboid bones
(Fig. 2d). However, in wombats and a range of macropodoids there is also considerable contact between digit IV
and the ectocuneiform (Fig. 2c). Within peramelemorphs,
there is some variation as to the degree to which the ectocuneiform is included in support of digit IV. This seems to
be related to locomotor mode, as the most extensive contact is in the cursorial bilbies, Macrotis lagotis and the

extinct Chaeropus ecaudatus. Digit V is supported by the
cuboid in all species.
Species for which claims of "incipient syndactyly" were
found in the literature are listed in Table 1. Visual investigation of study skins of didelphimorph marsupials show
that in most species, all middle digits (digits II-IV) are
highly similar. In some didelphimorphs, digits II and III
are more gracile than digits IV and V, and more similar to
each other (for an example, see Fig. 6), but never as distinctly so as in syndactylous marsupials. In no case are
digits II and III fully webbed, except in the fully webbed
feet of Chironectes minimus and in the foot of Notoryctes
typhlops, whose digits I-IV are webbed.

Discussion
The origins and evolution of marsupial syndactyly have
been debated for more than 150 years, although little
observational information has been collected. It may be
that the distinctive overall anatomy of syndactyly resulted
in the perception that it is distinctive enough not to
require further research. However, the results of this study
indicate that marsupial syndactyly has a unique evolutionary and developmental background which has previously been largely ignored. A synthesis of results from this
study takes the implications of this unique phenomenon
beyond its traditional role as a purely phylogenetic problem.

Raw data regressions

of digits II and III are virtually isometric with very little error, whereas all others, although sometimes close to isometric, have
considerably larger error around the regression line.
Unique integration in the syndactylous foot
The near-identity of correlation matrices of digits II and
III, combined with strict raw measurement isometry of
their digit elements across species, suggest that the syndactylous digits are highly constrained with respect to each
other across the diversity of syndactylous species. This is
congruent with the fact that the phalangeal skeleton of the
syndactylous digits is visually undistinguishable. This is
reminiscent of a definition of identical digits by Tabin
[[48], p. 290]: " Empirically, a digit is considered to have
the same identity as a second digit 'x' if, when examined
in isolation by a morphologist, the first digit would be
labeled as being a digit 'x'". Such a condition has few
counterparts in extant tetrapods. Among cases of marsupial-like syndactyly reported in placentals, only that in
digit III and IV in three closely related species of otter
shrew (Potamogale velox and two species of Micropotamogale) is directly comparable [49]; note that the reportedly syndactylous siamang gibbon Symphalangus
syndactylus has digits of different length [50]. To our

knowledge, conditions resembling marsupial syndactyly
are also unknown in extant amphibians or sauropsids
[51]. It could be argued that digits III and IV of hoofed
placentals (artiodactyla and perissodactyla) could be
comparable in their similarity to marsupial syndactyly.
However, autopodia of hoofed placentals follow a welldocumented pattern of increased central digit emphasis in
fore-and hindlimbs which is restricted to cursorial mammals [32,52,53]. Marsupial syndactyly is not comparable
since it is restricted to the foot and morphologically and
functionally diverse, and does not correspond to any
obvious locomotor adaptation.
Syndactyly does not constrain functional adaptation of the
foot
Autopodial anatomy in tetrapods is strongly tied to locomotor function [54-56], and this is reflected in greater variation in autopodial anatomy compared to more
proximally situated limb elements [57,58]. Extensive
locomotor adaptation within pedal digits is evident from

the matrix comparisons involving digits II or III versus IV
and V. Digit and phalangeal proportions correspond with
those generally predicted for mammalian autopodia
[7,55,56,59,60]: arboreal species have higher phalangeal
indices and phalangeal slenderness ratios, while species
with exclusively terrestrial locomotion have shorter
phalanges and more sturdy phalangeal proportions.

and has been considered "incipient syndactyly". However,
these digit proportions are common in arboreal mammals
and do not seem equivalent to syndactyly. Scale bar = 1 cm

Between-digit ratio differences also reveal considerable
differentiation of digits with respect to each other (except
II and III) according to locomotion. Although not morphometrically assessed, digit I also follows widely recognized patterns of functional adaptation [52]: it is strongly
developed and opposable in the arboreal possums and
koalas, and reduced or absent in the hopping or bounding
kangaroos and bandicoots, which is consistent with patterns of marginal digit loss observed in cursorial, bounding and hopping mammals [37,52,56].
The fact that syndactylous digit proportions differ significantly between locomotor groups supports the hypothesis
that they evolve as a unit subject to selection pressures.
This complements the results of dissection studies which
show that the muscles operating the syndactylous digits
are as well developed and functional as in non-syndactylous species [summarized in [3,33]]. In this respect, length
similarity of syndactylous phalangeal elements may hold
an important implication for their mobility: because the
digits are tightly appressed under a common skin sheath
and bound by connective tissue [3], their capacity to flex

and extend depends on alignment of the joints along a
plane that allows them to move together.

that the "reduction" of digits is not an intrinsic property
of syndactyly, but may be it's consequence.

It is notable that proportions and morphology of all pedal
digits in macropodoids (kangaroos) and peramelemorphs
are highly similar (see Figure 2c, d). This includes an
enlarged digit IV as the main axis of the foot, a slightly
smaller digit V, very thin and gracile digits II and III, and
reduced or absent digit I. This convergence is interesting
because emphasis of central digits often coincides with
evolutionary trends in placentals towards cursoriality or
bounding locomotion [37,61]. Tyndale-Biscoe [62] suggested that syndactyly arose as an adaptation to cursoriality or bounding in Peramelemorpha and Diprotodontia.
This is unlikely if it is true that the ancestors of both clades
were arboreal [6,8,16,25,28,36]. Conversely, however, the
functional loss of a digit in syndactylous feet may have
favoured the evolution of the bounding or half-bounding
habit in both clades.

Character distribution of syndactyly
The question as to whether marsupial syndactyly arose
once or twice has been discussed extensively, mainly
because convergent origins of this perceivedly complex
character have been deemed unlikely [16]. A sister group
relationship between Peramelemorpha and Diprotodontia, and as such a single origin for syndactyly in these two
clades, can be ruled out based on the latest phylogenies.
However, it has been suggested that syndactyly may be in
fact homoplastic within a larger marsupial clade
[21,23,27]. Support for this notion comes from possible
tracks of a syndactylous marsupial from the Cretaceous of
British Colombia [63] and, tentatively, from the Late Cretaceous of Western Colorado [64]. Moreover, claims of
"incipient syndactyly" in some South American Didelphimorphia and the marsupial mole Notoryctes typhlops have
been considered evidence of an older origin of syndactyly.
Extensive connection of digits II and III by skin was only
observed in the fully webbed feet of the semiaquatic
Yapok Chironectes minimus and the mostly webbed feet of
Notoryctes typhlops, but digits II and III and their elements
do not resemble each other and are not closely appressed
[3]. The sporadic occurrence of digits II and III which are
shorter than digit IV in some didelphimorphs is not unusual for mammals. It is neither as highly conserved as syndactyly in Diprotodontia and Peramelemorpha, nor does
it resemble it to a great degree. It is possible that the
shorter length of digits II and III in these species is due to
their mostly arboreal or scansorial habit [49], which commonly coincides with short medial digits [7,55,65,66].
The results of this study therefore suggest that syndactyly
is convergent in Diprotodontia and Peramelemorpha,
and is not plesiomorphic for marsupials.

Syndactyly may not be a functional-adaptive trait
The few studies that have been concerned with the origins
of syndactyly have invoked functional-adaptive scenarios
for their appearance, either as grooming organs
[3,11,18,31] or as an adaptation to arboreality [13,28,29].
However, marsupial syndactyly does not resemble any
autopodial adaptations ever evolved in mammalian
autopodia. The characteristics of syndactyly are unique
among terrestrial mammalian orders (except for three species of otter shrews). The coinciding heterochrony and
integration in syndactylous digits also cannot be
explained by simple processes of locomotor adaptation,
particularly because these patterns are conservative across
the considerable diversity of locomotor types in Diprotodontia. Rather, syndactyly may represent a constraint that
the foot is adapted to. Under this scenario, digits IV and V,
which are always well developed, compensate for the
"unification" of the two syndactylous digits. An interesting further implication of viewing syndactyly as a constraint would be a new view of the perceived "reduction"
of the syndactylous digits, which has been taken to be a
hallmark of syndactyly [3,13,21,28]. If digits II and III
were constrained to evolve as a single digit and functional
unit, it would be expected that the most advantageous
dimensions of this complex would be that of a single
digit, which is indeed reflected in the dimensions of the
syndactylous complex [13]. This would also explain why
the much-noted "reduction" is not a general feature of
marsupial syndactylous digits. For example, in most arboreal species the syndactylous digits are well developed
[[3]; see also Fig. 2a, b]. In fact, the syndactylous digit
complex in wombats is longer, although not wider, than
digits IV and V (pers. obs.), which is congruent with their
digging habit [56,61]. As such, there is evidence to suggest

Scenarios for the origins of syndactyly
Given the extensive similarities of peramelemorph and
diprotodontian syndactyly, the convergent evolution of
this trait in the two clades appears unlikely to have
occurred at random. It is possible that convergence of syndactyly constitutes a case of parallelism which develops
through similar or identical developmental pathways [1].
This would suggest that that there is a greater likelihood of
syndactyly evolving in peramelemorphs and diprotodontians due to shared ancestral developmental patterns.
Occurrence of full syndactyly in early marsupials and/or
metatherians, as has been suggested based on Cretaceous
tracks [63,64], is also conceivable under this scenario.

How syndactyly could establish itself twice, and the
nature of the developmental changes involved, are difficult to establish in the absence of a functional-adaptive
scenario. However, the results of this study provide cir-

cumstantial evidence that allow the position of hypotheses for further testing. Integration and isometry of digits II
and III can be explained in two ways; firstly, as an adaptation to a bounding of digits by skin, and secondly, as the
result of a change in ontogenetic patterns that "synchronized" the morphology of the syndactylous digits. Under
the first scenario, syndactyly would have established itself
as a malformation, possibly during a time when the ancestral populations were undergoing a bottleneck event [13];
the length isometry of the digits could have arisen because
this allowed the digits to function as a unit (see above).
However, this includes the unparsimonious scenario of a
malformation establishing itself in two unrelated marsupial populations, with subsequent highly similar morphological outcomes. Also, if syndactyly were just a skin
fusion of the digits, this would not explain the ossification
heterochrony that coincides with syndactyly in Diprotodontia and Peramelemorpha.
The second scenario, positing an ontogenetic pattern
change, may be more parsimonious and is favoured by
some of the evidence from this study. If the morphometric
integration of digit elements is intrinsic to syndactyly
through an ontogenetic constraint, the establishment of
syndactyly as a non-adaptive trait is less improbable
because, as discussed above, it effectively retains the
capacity of digit flexion and extension. As such, syndactyly
would only represent the loss of a single digit, rather than
the incapacitation of both digits as in soft-tissue syndactyly of the human hand [67]. Digit loss is common in
mammals, although marginal digits are usually affected
[32,36,37,52]. With functional syndactylous digits, the
net loss of a single digit may have had a mild impact, compared to a loss of flexing capacity, as is the case in syndactylous human hands. This may have aided the spread of
marsupial syndactyly through the ancestral populations.
Phenotypes resembling marsupial syndactyly in that the
digits display identical morphologies have existed in
some of the earliest tetrapods such as Acanthostega; this
similarity has been ascribed to identical patterns of morphogen expression in the digits [48]. Identical digits have
also been created through biochemical manipulation of
developing autopodia of mice, chicks, and frogs [68-71].
These experiments largely involve alteration in the expression or concentration of morphogens [mostly bmp family
transcription factors; [68,69,72,73]]. It is notable that
many of these are intimately associated with retention of
the inter-digital membrane as it occurs in syndactylous
marsupials. As ossification heterochrony and integration
of digits II and III hint at ontogenetic changes in these two
digits, it should be tested whether the switch to syndactyly
involves a naturally occuring change in one of these pathways. Should this be the case, it would be predicted that
the ancestral phenotype of syndactyly arose rapidly and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/160

was largely similar to that of the more plesiomorphic syndactylous marsupials today. This would provide an avenue for rapid origin of fully integrated, and as such fully
functional, syndactylous digits. It would also explain the
lack of intermediates of syndactylous feet in extant or
extinct marsupials and the heterochrony observed in this
study. A similar scenario has been argued by Sears [40]
with respect to the origin of bat wings, explaining the conservative size relationship of digits across bat species, as
well as the lack of fossil intermediates of bat wings, with a
localized change in bmp expression patterns.
Tarsal-metatarsal articulations are not impacted by
syndactyly
The generalized pattern of tarsal-metatarsal articulations
throughout marsupials is that digit I articulates with the
ectocuneiform, digit II with the mesocuneiform, digit III
with the ectocuneiform, and digits IV and V articulate with
the cuboid bone. This pattern is highly conserved among
marsupials and is already present in the oldest metatherian tarsus known to date, belonging to Sinodelphys szalayi
[74]. Woodburne and Case [27] argued that differences of
tarsal/metatarsal arrangement in Diprotodontia and Peramelemorpha suggest convergent evolution of syndactyly
in these clades. However, the results of this study disagree
with Woodburne and Case's [27] reports in several points.
Their claim that the endocuneiform is lost in macropodoids cannot be confirmed [see also [25]], and no evidence was found to support a "lateral dislocation" of
peramelemorph metatarsals with respect to tarsals.
Indeed, no difference in articulation patterns of peramelemorphs compared to other marsupials was noted, other
than that pertaining to digit IV. Given the conservatism of
tarsal anatomy with respect to metatarsals II and III across
all marsupials, it seems that syndactyly is a phenomenon
exclusively confined to digit morphology and has no
impact on tarsal morphology. The peramelemorph tarsal
arrangement also appears in hoofed placentals, where it is
considered to represent an adaptation to the emphasis on
the central digits [15]. It is noteworthy that kangaroos,
whose plesiomorphic locomotion patterns resemble
those of peramelemorphs [75], also show a tendency
towards increased contact between metatarsal IV and the
ectocuneiform. This suggests that the extensive contact
between metatarsal IV and the ectocuneiform in peramelemorphs is related to a stabilizing re-arrangement, rather
than a result of syndactyly.
Marsupial and human syndactyly
Marsupial syndactyly derives its name from a congenital
malformation in humans, and has been treated as directly
comparable [13,23,42,50,62]. Human syndactyly is an
overarching term for a diverse congenital condition which
always involves incomplete digit separation during early
development due to a lack of inter-digit membrane cell

Page 9 of 14

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:160

death, or through synostoses [76]. Marsupial syndactyly
only corresponds to a mild subtype of syndactyly termed
"zygodactyly" [77,78]. However, in its worst form human
syndactyly can involve synostoses of the majority of digit
elements [76]. Contrary to a popular notion in the field of
marsupial systematics [21,23,42,62] the genetic background of syndactyly is complicated and only known for
a few of the over 50 types [76,77]. It is notable that even
the mildest forms of syndactyly in the hand lead to incapacitation of grasping capability of the affected digits and
require surgical treatment, although they are rarely separated in the foot [67]. Human syndactyly is only partly
heritable, and within families where syndactyly is passed
on, it manifests variably in terms of severity, the limb
affected, and number of digits involved [77]. The present
results reveal that marsupial syndactyly is a highly specific
phenotype that does not compare to human syndactyly
more than superficially because marsupial syndactyly is
entirely heritable and highly conservative in its manifestation. As such, the term "syndactyly" is slightly unfortunate
for the unique condition found in marsupials, and has in
the past lead to the uncritical assumption that the two
conditions are directly comparable. It may be desirable to
clearly distinguish between the two conditions by consistently referring to marsupial syndactyly as such, or introducing a new term (for example, "homodactyly" may be
appropriate given the similarity of digits II and III) altogether.

Conclusion
The diverse methods employed in this study have provided novel insights on the phenomenon of marsupial
syndactyly. The results demonstrate that the syndactylous
digits of marsupials evolve as a unit which is subject to
functional adaptation like the remaining digits of the foot.
The strong integration between the two digits may be due
to a change in early developmental patterning, as the ossification heterochrony between syndactylous compared to
non-syndactylous species suggests. No evidence was
found for incipient syndactyly in other marsupials, but
the ossification similarity of pedal digits in Diprotodontia
and Peramelemorpha suggest an underlying developmental parallelism. We argue that locomotor adaptation is not
likely to be the cause for syndactyly; based on our results,
we suggest a scenario in which syndactyly arose as a single
change in digit ontogeny that amounted to the loss of a
single digit, rather than incapacitation of both digits
through skin webbing. We also show that syndactyly is
restricted to Peramelemorpha and Diprotodontia, and
has no influence on tarsal bone arrangement in either
clade. Together, the results change the relevance of marsupial syndactyly from being an enigmatic phylogenetic
character within marsupials to a rare transformation of
digit morphology whose molecular background has the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/160

potential to provide important insights into the patterns
of digit evolution.

Methods
Morphometric data collection
Articulated pedal skeletons from specimens of 32 syndactylous marsupial species were measured. Species were
selected to include the full range of pedal diversity in syndactylous marsupials. Raw measurements and accession
numbers can be found in Additional files 1 and 4; for terminology, refer to Figure 2a. Measurements of 11
phalangeroid and petauroid possums, 11 kangaroos, 7
vombatiforms (four extinct), and 4 peramelemorphs were
taken using digital calipers (specified accuracy ± 0.02
mm). In most extant species, two adult specimens per species were measured and measurements were averaged following Christiansen [79]; all individual measurements
were taken twice and averaged. Measurements comprised
length and mid-shaft width of metatarsals, proximal and
intermediate phalanges II-V (a total of 6 measurements
per digit). Measurements for digit I were not taken since
this digit is reduced or lost in kangaroos and bandicoots.
Matrix comparisons and assessment of raw measurements
of non-size adjusted data
To assess inter-digit integration patterns across the diversity of syndactylous marsupials, a variance/covariance and
correlation matrix comparison approach was employed.
Matrix comparisons are suited for this problem because
they can quantify integration patterns that may constrain
morphological variability of the trait components with
respect to each other [58,80-83]. Natural logarithm-transformed morphometric measurements were investigated.
The measurements were not otherwise adjusted by size
because relative size variation is an important factor in differences between the syndactylous and non-syndactylous
digits. Correlation and variance/covariance matrices of
digit measurements were computed for each digit, resulting in 6 × 6 matrices. Correlation matrices were compared
using a Mantel's test [84] implemented by the freeware
Microsoft Excel-addin PopTools [85], which compares the
matrices and provides a non-parametric estimate for the
significance of the correlation. Variance-covariance matrices were compared using the random skewers method
[82,86], run through a Monte-Carlo simulation implemented by PopTools [58]. Matrix repeatabilities were also
computed as a measure of sampling error following
Cheverud [80] and Marroig and Cheverud [82] using the
Monte-Carlo simulation routine in PopTools.

Matrix correlations provide an estimate of correlated evolution between the traits studied, but they do not provide
information on absolute size relationships. In other
words, two anatomical complexes can have highly similar
matrices but be of greatly differing absolute sizes. As

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:160

noted above, size relationships between digits are a crucial
component in this study because syndactyly manifests
itself in unusually "synchronized" – looking size relationships between digits II and III. To address this, raw length
measurements were plotted for visual assessment and
their correlations were compared using Fisher's z test [87].
Locomotor indices – proportional differences
Morphometric correlates of locomotion of non-syndactylous autopodial anatomy are well understood [7,52], so
that it is possible test whether the syndactylous foot is
subject to generally recognized patterns of locomotor
adaptation. The species measured were divided into three
locomotor groups: hopping and bounding species (kangaroos/rat kangaroos and bandicoots), arboreal species
(phalangeroid and petauroid possums), and terrestrial
plantigrade species (vombatiforms). Based on the morphometric measurements, differences in morphometric
locomotor predictor indices were computed. Using ratiobased locomotor indices is a convenient way of focusing
on that part of the variation which is explained exclusively
by proportional, rather than size-related, differences. The
phalangeal index [proximal and intermediate phalangeal
length as a percentage of metatarsal length; [59,88]] and
metatarsal, proximal phalangeal, and intermediate slenderness ratios [SRs; element length*100/element width;
[7]] were employed because they are known to be reliable
proxies of locomotor habit. Locomotor index comparisons were conducted on two levels: Firstly, measurements
in single digits were compared between locomotor
groups. Secondly, ratios between locomotor indices of
digit pairs were compared to capture some of the disparities in between-digit proportions in species of different
locomotor types.

Because of disparate and relatively small sample sizes in
each locomotor group, the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis
test was performed to assess whether significant differences existed within the three locomotor groups. Indices
for which significant results were found were also investigated using post-hoc Wilcoxon signed rank sum tests to
assess whether all three locomotor types are distinguished
using the predictor indices.
Digit ossification sequences
To investigate pedal digit ontogeny in syndactylous marsupials, ossification sequences of pedal digit elements
were recorded for ontogenetic series of 5 diprotodontian
species, the peramelemorph Isoodon macroura, 2 dasyurids, the ameridelphian Didelphis virginiana, the placental
mouse Mus musculus, and the skincid lizard Hemiergis peronii as an outgroup. Museum accession numbers are listed
in Additional file 4. Sequence data were collected from the
literature for Hemiergis peronii [89], Mus musculus [54],
Sminthopsis macroura [90], and Didelphis virginiana

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/160

[91,92]. Pouch young from the personal collection of VW
were clear stained according to Dingerkus and Uhler [93],
modified by Prochel [94]. The remaining specimens were
investigated by acquiring X-ray images (using a SkyScan
1172 desktop micro-computer tomography scanner) of
the specimen's lower half of the body, taken at 30° intervals during a 360° rotation to allow a multi-angle view of
the foot.
The ossification onset of metacarpals and phalangeal elements in all digits was recorded. For each species, ranks
were given to ossifications in the order in which they
occur, and compared across species. Sequence heterochrony in the appearance of ossification sequences was
also summarized by coding the sequences into event pairs
[46,95] and analysing these using the Parsimov program
package [96]. The consensus of ACCTRAN and DELTRAN
optimized analyses is presented here. This means that
ambiguous transformations are not considered, which
results in a conservative but more reliable estimate [96].
Because the sample for peramelemorphs contained only
one poorly resolved species, Parsimov was run without it.
Tarsal-metatarsal articulations and "incipient syndactyly"
The tarsal-metatarsal joint was investigated in 23 species
from 5 marsupial orders. Accession numbers can be found
in Additional file 4; for terminology, refer to Figure 2a.
When possible, several individuals per species were investigated. The tarsal/metatarsal articulations were listed for
each species.

A literature search for reports of "incipient syndactyly"
was conducted, and species for which reports exist were
re-investigated (Table 1). This was done using study skins
whose pedal skeleton was left in the skin, and articulated
pedal skeletons (for accession numbers, see Additional
file 4).

Authors' contributions
VW wrote the manuscript, collected and analysed the
morphometric data and most ossification data except
those obtained from clearing and staining. MN conducted
the clearing and staining on specimens provided by VW
and collected and analysed data on tarsal morphology
and incipient syndactyly. MN also reviewed the literature
on the historical, phylogenetic, and molecular context of
syndactyly and contributed to the drafting of the manuscript. Both authors read and approved the final manuscript.
