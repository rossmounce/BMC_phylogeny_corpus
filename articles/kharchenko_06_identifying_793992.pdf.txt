Abstract
Background: Existing large-scale metabolic models of sequenced organisms commonly include
enzymatic functions which can not be attributed to any gene in that organism. Existing
computational strategies for identifying such missing genes rely primarily on sequence homology to
known enzyme-encoding genes.
Results: We present a novel method for identifying genes encoding for a specific metabolic
function based on a local structure of metabolic network and multiple types of functional
association evidence, including clustering of genes on the chromosome, similarity of phylogenetic
profiles, gene expression, protein fusion events and others. Using E. coli and S. cerevisiae metabolic
networks, we illustrate predictive ability of each individual type of association evidence and show
that significantly better predictions can be obtained based on the combination of all data. In this
way our method is able to predict 60% of enzyme-encoding genes of E. coli metabolism within the
top 10 (out of 3551) candidates for their enzymatic function, and as a top candidate within 43% of
the cases.
Conclusion: We illustrate that a combination of genome context and other functional association
evidence is effective in predicting genes encoding metabolic enzymes. Our approach does not rely
on direct sequence homology to known enzyme-encoding genes, and can be used in conjunction
with traditional homology-based metabolic reconstruction methods. The method can also be used
to target orphan metabolic activities.

Background
Comprehensive and accurate reconstruction of the metabolic networks remains an important problem for both
newly sequenced and well-studied organisms [1,2]. The
challenges posed by the experimental determination of

the metabolic enzymes have lead to development of computational methods for metabolic reconstruction. The
most common approach is to identify genes encoding a
specific metabolic enzyme by establishing sequence
homology to functionally characterized enzymes in other

genes is tested by measuring its self-rank - the rank of a true enzyme-encoding gene in the candidate set. The candidates are

The overall association strength is a combination of layer association scores that measure strength of functional association of
the candidate gene with known enzyme-encoding genes in a single layer of the metabolic neighborhood (3 layers, as illustrated
in a.). The candidate set contains all genes that are not already part of the metabolic network.

species [3]. Although such sequence homology methods
have been remarkably successful overall, they fail to identify enzymes encoded by genes with poor sequence
homology to known metabolic enzymes, and result in
partially reconstructed metabolic networks. In some cases
sufficient biological evidence exists to believe that a particular pathway is present in the organism, however genes
associated with key reaction steps can not be identified.
The problem of identifying genes encoding for a specific
metabolic function in such partially reconstructed networks has been referred to as the "missing gene" problem
[4]. The case for a missing gene can be based either on
direct experimental evidence for a particular enzymatic
function in the organism, or on variety of comparative
and computational analysis of known metabolic pathways, biochemical constraints and environmental condi-

tions [4,5]. We note that the problem of identifying
missing genes, considered in this manuscript, is different
from the traditional problem of functional gene annotation, which aims to assign function to a given gene.
Computational strategies for identifying missing metabolic genes rely on refined sequence homology analysis
[2,6] and consideration of functional association evidence
linking candidate genes with known enzyme-encoding
genes [4]. For example, PathwayTools hole-filler developed by Green et al. [6], prioritizes candidates obtained
from an initial sequence homology search by using,
among other factors, information on whether the candidate gene is located adjacent to, or in the same transcriptional unit as known enzyme-encoding genes of related
metabolic function. In some cases, strong genome context

association evidence, such as clustering of genes on the
chromosome, or co-occurrence of genes in phylogenetic
lineages, has played a key role in identifying metabolic
genes in several organisms [7-9].
An extensive set of tools has been developed to detect and
catalog general pair-wise functional associations between
genes based on a combination of genome context methods and other evidence, such as co-expression or protein
interactions [10,11]. Combinations of heterogeneous
association evidence have been used for general functional inference [12], prediction of protein complexes
[13-15] and synthetic lethal interactions [16]. A recent
work by Yamanishi et al. [17] relied on a combination of
genomic, mRNA expression and localization evidence,
together with information on chemical compatibility to
reconstruct metabolic pathways from known metabolic
enzymes. While it has been suggested that genome context
associations can be used for general prediction of missing
enzyme-encoding genes [4,18], methods for systematic
targeting of missing genes have not been characterized.
We develop a method for generating such predictions
based on combination of genome context and other functional association evidence, and show that it is effective
for majority of the enzymatic functions in E. coli and S.
cerevisiae.
In an earlier study we have described a method for identifying missing enzyme-encoding genes based on gene coexpression and local structure of metabolic network [19].
The candidate genes for encoding a missing metabolic
enzyme were evaluated based on the overall similarity of
their expression profile with the expression of the metabolic network neighborhood of the missing enzyme (Figure 1a). The local property of gene co-expression, which
formed the basis of this method, is also observed for other
types of functional associations, in particular for associations established by genome context [20]. In this work we
show that such approach can be extended to identify metabolic enzyme-encoding genes from a number of different
types of functional association evidence, including phylogenetic profile co-occurrence, physical clustering of genes
on the chromosome and protein interaction data. We
note that the presented method does not rely on sequence
homology to known enzymes, and its predictions are
complementary to the traditional methods of metabolic
reconstruction.
We illustrate the performance of each individual type of
association evidence by testing how well the method is
able to predict known enzyme-encoding genes of E. coli
[2] and S. cerevisiae [21] metabolic models (see Methods).
A set of candidate genes, containing all non-metabolic
genes in an organism, is evaluated and prioritized by eval-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/177

uating overall association of each candidate gene with the
neighborhood of the missing metabolic enzyme (Figure
1b). The overall association is calculated by combining
associations with each layer of the metabolic neighborhood. Specifically, for a missing enzyme with a metabolic
neighborhood consisting of layers {L1, L2, L3}, each candidate gene x is evaluated by a combination of layer association scores, scoreLi (x), that measure the strength of
functional associations of candidate gene x with known
enzyme-encoding genes in the neighborhood layer Li (see
Methods). The individual layer association scores are
combined using one of two methods (ADT or DLR) to
obtain a measure of overall association of candidate gene
x with the metabolic network neighborhood of the missing enzyme.
To assess the performance of our method we rely on a selfrank measure, which is the rank of a known enzymeencoding gene among the set of candidates prioritized for
its own metabolic function (see Methods). We develop
techniques for combining multiple types of association
evidence and show that significantly better prediction performance can be achieved based on combined association
evidence.

Results
Similarity of phylogenetic profiles
A number of earlier studies have explored using patterns
of gene co-occurrence or absence in the phylogenetic lineages to infer functional association between gene pairs
[22,23]. The basic premise of the method is that a function is likely to be encoded by several associated genes;
therefore lineages maintaining only some of these genes
will have lower evolutionary fitness. For instance,
enzymes catalyzing successive steps of a linear metabolic
pathway are likely to be present together in an organisms
relying on that metabolic pathway, and absent together
from an organisms that does not require that pathway.

A phylogenetic profile of a given gene on a set of NG
genomes can be encoded as binary string of length NG,
with each position marking presence (1) or absence (0) of
an ortholog in the corresponding genome. Functional
association between a pair of genes is assessed by the
degree of similarity of their phylogenetic profiles. A
number of different distance measures have been used to
calculate such similarity, including Hamming string distance, mutual information and hypergeometric distribution [11,22,24,25]. We find that the performance of
different distance measures is very similar (see Additional
file 1). These profile similarity measures do not take into
account variable degree of divergence between genomes
comprising the orthology dataset. This is particularly clear

in the case of Hypergeometric distribution measure
[11,25], which assumes that ortholog occurrences are
independently and identically distributed across the set of
included genomes (see Methods).
The identity assumption would suggest that the total
number of ortholog occurrences within each genome
should be approximately the same, and the distribution of
the number of orthologs should form a single, narrow
peak around an average ortholog number. The empirical
distribution (see Additional file 2), however, is quite different from the expected form, lacking a peak around the
mean, and showing substantial density over almost an
entire range of ortholog numbers. When the identity
assumption is relaxed, profile similarity probability is
described by the Extended Multivariable Hypergeometric
distribution [26]. Because probability functions of this
distribution have not been derived in a closed form, we
developed a numerical algorithm for estimating these
probabilities (see Methods).
Bias stemming from the violation of the independence
assumption can be minimized by exclusion or reduction
of closely related species in the ortholog occurrence dataset. We employ a method similar to previously published
work [10], which reduces the bias by folding together phy-

logenetic branches containing closely related species, and
using an ortholog occurrence pattern based on the agreement within the folded branch (see Methods).
The effect of both corrections on the ability to predict
enzyme-encoding genes in E. coli is illustrated by the
cumulative self-rank distributions (see Methods) in Figure
2a. The extended hypergeometric distribution correction
for the variable genome divergence from E. coli target
genome (violation of the identity assumption) provides a
noticeable improvement in prediction performance (8%
at self-rank threshold of 50). On the other hand, the folding method correcting for variable divergence with the set
of query genomes (violation of independence assumption) does not significantly improve the results.
The phylogenetic profile co-occurrence method depends
on identification of orthologous genes across potentially
diverse lineages. Existing investigations have used a variety of methods, including readily available Clusters of
Orthologous Groups (COG) database [27,10,25], closest
homologs [11], and best bi-directional homology pairs
[24]. The results presented in our work rely on two alternative sets of orthology data. The first set comes from
KEGG SSDB database [28], and includes closest homologs
and best bi-directional hits as determined by the Smith
and Waterman algorithm (we will refer to it as KEGG-

based dataset). The second set was constructed based on
results of BLAST [29] queries against a "non-redundant"
set of known protein sequences maintained by NCBI (see
Methods). The set also includes information on reverse
BLAST searches to determine best bi-directional hits
(referred to as BLAST-based dataset).
Predictive performance of different orthology datasets is
compared in Figure 2b. We note that coverage of the COG
orthology data is biased towards genes encoding known
metabolic enzymes (see Additional file 16), and the selfrank performance of this dataset was estimated by normalizing with respect to the non-metabolic gene coverage.
Figure 2b shows that profile associations calculated using
BLAST-based dataset provide better predictions of
enzyme-encoding genes than association based on the
KEGG orthology dataset. We also find that in the case of
both datasets better performance is attained when using
best bi-directional homology pairs instead of closest
homologs (see see Additional file 3).
As a consequence of gene duplications, metabolism contains a significant number of paralogous enzyme pairs
[30]. In many cases, such enzymes continue to catalyze
the same reactions (see Additional file 4). Such pairs will
frequently have similar or identical orthology mappings,
and their inclusion can lead to a significant bias in estima-

tion of the predictive performance (see Additional file 5).
The results presented in this work, therefore, exclude selfranks of any metabolic enzymes that have high sequence
homology to any other metabolic enzyme in the organism
(see Methods).
Co-expression of orthologous genes
The approach for identifying enzyme-encoding genes
based on the similarity of mRNA expression profiles [19]
can be extended to include co-expression information of
orthologous genes in other organisms. Conservation of
mRNA co-expression across different species has been
investigated by a number of recent studies [31-34]. For
example, analysis of co-expressed gene pairs between S.
cerevisiae and C. elegans shows statistically significant (P
value < 10-3) level of conservation [32]. Although the
number of pairs with highly conserved co-expression is
small, incorporating ortholog co-expression can provide
significant improvements to the accuracy of functional
predictions based on the mRNA expression data [31,32].

We find that enzyme-encoding gene predictions based on
the co-expression of E. coli orthologs in S. cerevisiae (see
Methods) achieve good performance on the enzymes covered by such dataset. Although S. cerevisiae orthologs can
be identified for only 40.1% of E. coli metabolic genes,
combining native and ortholog co-expression scores provides noticeable improvements. Combination of native
and ortholog co-expression increases the fraction of metabolic enzymes predicted within the top 50 candidates
from 27% to 36% (see Additional file 6). Similarly, using
E. coli expression data improves prediction results for
enzyme-encoding genes of S. cerevisiae metabolic network. Overall self-rank performance based on combined
co-expression data is included in Figure 4.
Clustering of genes on the chromosome
Relative positions of genes on the chromosome have also
been successfully used to infer functional associations.
Most notably, analysis of prokaryotic genomes focused on
identifying pairs of orthologs located close to each other
on the chromosome, as well as sets of such pairs
[10,35,36]. Such clustering is also observed in the eukaryotic genomes, even though they lack well-defined operon
structures. A recent study by Lee et al. [37] analyzed clustering of genes in KEGG pathways for 5 distant eukaryotic
species. The study demonstrated that depending on the
genome, 30% to 98% of the pathways exhibit statistically
significant levels of gene clustering on the chromosome. A
variety of methods have been developed for identifying
chromosome gene clusters and evaluating their significance [38]. To generate association scores we use a simple
statistical evaluation strategy based on the chromosome
gene order, which allows for computationally efficient
treatment of large number of genomes (see Methods).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/177

The self-rank performance based on the chromosome
clustering association is shown in Figure 4. The overall
performance for known E. coli metabolic enzymes is better than for the S. cerevisiae enzymes, which is expected
given the prominent role of operons in prokaryotic transcriptional regulation.
Other association measures
Interacting proteins encoded by separate genes in some
species, may sometimes occur as a single, multi-domain
fusion protein in other species. Detecting fusion of nonhomologous proteins in another organism has been
shown to be a significant predictor of functional association between genes [39-41]. Our calculations of a fusion
association score are based on a combination of fusions
detected at several sequence homology thresholds (see
Methods, Additional file 7. The overall performance of the
method is included in Figure 4. Although protein fusion
associations are only able to predict relatively small fraction of enzyme-encoding genes (18% for E. coli), almost
all of predicted enzymes are returned within the top 20
candidates.

A number of metabolic reactions are catalyzed by well
established protein complexes, such as the phosphofructokinase complex. Furthermore, metabolic processes
commonly involve interactions between multiple metabolic enzymes. For instance, the phosphofructokinase
alpha subunit encoded by Pfk1 also interacts with a product of Fba1, fructose-biphosphate adolase II, catalyzing an
adjacent reaction in the glycolysis pathway [42]. Large
protein-protein interaction datasets have been generated
by studies using yeast two-hybrid systems [43,44] and,
more recently, mass spectrometry-based techniques
[45,46]. In the framework of our approach, candidate
genes can be evaluated by assessing the overall amount of
interactions between a candidate gene and the metabolic
network neighborhood of a missing enzyme. To assess
confidence of individual interactions, our analysis makes
use of the probabilistic protein interaction dataset from
Jansen et al. [13], which combines results of four highthroughput interaction datasets [43-46]. The performance
of our prediction method on the protein interaction data
is significantly lower than that of other association scores,
nevertheless it is above of what is expected from a random
association score (Figure 4b).
Functional association can be also assessed through similarity of deletion mutant phenotypes under a large set of
environmental conditions. For example, deletions of
genes that are adjacent to each other in a linear metabolic
pathway are likely to result in identical mutant phenotypes. A recent work by Dudley et al. [47] experimentally
measured growth phenotypes of 4710 S. cerevisiae
mutants under 21 experimental conditions, including dif-

ferent carbon sources, nutrient limitations, stress and others conditions. We tested the performance of our
prediction algorithm on a set of 53 known metabolic
enzyme-encoding genes for which high-confidence data
was available (see Additional file 8). While the results
illustrate predictive power of phenotypic profile associations, overall contribution of this score to the predictions
of unidentified enzyme-encoding genes is very small. This
is expected, because available high-confidence phenotypic data covers only 14% of S. cerevisiae genes.

can be either constructed manually, for example by consulting experts [12], or learned from known test-cases.
This problem has been extensively considered with
respect to confidence in pair-wise gene functional associations, and test cases for learning the priors were based on
known functional groupings, such as GO annotations
[48] or membership in KEGG pathways [10]. For the current problem of prioritizing enzyme-encoding gene candidates, such priors can be learned from known enzymeencoding genes [6].

Overall enhancements of the individual association scores
Description of a metabolic network neighborhood can be
enhanced by considering relative strength of metabolic
connections established by different metabolites. Metabolites connecting many enzyme-encoding genes pairs
establish, on average, weaker functional associations [20].
The performance of our predictive method can be
improved by weighting the contribution of each neighbor
in evaluating the overall association of a candidate gene
with the metabolic network neighborhood of a missing
enzyme. The weight is assigned according to the total
number of enzyme pairs associated with a connecting
metabolite (see Methods).

Towards the goal of integrating multiple types of association evidence, we have developed two distinct methods.
The first approach is based on a direct likelihood-ratio
(DLR) evaluation of the association score probability distributions. The likelihood that a given candidate gene
encodes the desired metabolic enzyme is calculated under
the simplifying assumptions that individual association
scores are independent and monotonic. The monotonic
assumption states that for every association score, the likelihood of association increases monotonically with the
absolute value of the score. Both assumptions allow for
useful approximations, but in general can be shown to be
incorrect. For example, clustering of genes on the chromosomes in E. coli is statistically significantly correlated with
the similarity in expression profiles (Spearman rank correlation P value < 10-10), violating the independence
assumption. The DLR method calculates overall likelihood ratio of a candidate gene encoding the desired
enzyme as a product of likelihood ratios for each individual association score (see Methods).

Distributions of association scores between a given gene
and all other genes in an organism tend to differ from one
gene to another. For instance, a gene whose orthologs can
be identified in many organisms will typically have more
high-confidence chromosome clustering associations
than a gene with relatively few detected orthologs. This
introduces bias when evaluating overall association with
a metabolic network neighborhood. The association-rank
rescaling (see Methods) reduces this bias by translating
raw association scores into probabilities of metabolic
adjacency, calculated based on the rank of raw association
score within a distribution of all scores for a particular
gene. The rescaling procedure also reduces the number of
false positives by considering raw association score of a
gene pair with respect to organism-wide score distributions of both genes and choosing a more conservative
adjacency probability value.
The effect of metabolite-weighting and association-rank
corrections on the self-rank performance is shown in
Additional file 9. The predictive performance of all association scores is improved by either correction, with the
exception of the protein fusion score, where application
of metabolite weighting results in weaker performance.
Predictions based on combined association evidence
Enzyme-encoding gene predictions based on the individual association scores can be combined to achieve better
performance. Normalizing relative strength of different
association scores requires informative priors. Such priors

The second approach uses a general machine learning
method called Adaboost [49,50], and does not rely on
independence or monotonicity of the association scores.
The generated classifiers are in the form of alternating decision trees (ADT), which are generalization of decision
stumps, decision trees, and their combination [51] (see
Additional file 10). In addition to flexible semantic representation, ADT-based classifiers provide a real-valued
measure of confidence, called classification margin, which
can be related to the probability of a given classification
being correct [52]. The Adaboost method has been successfully applied to several large-scale biological problems, including detection of transcription factor binding
motifs and prediction of regulatory response [53,54].
We find that in identifying missing metabolic genes both
ADT and DLR methods achieve comparable levels of performance (Figure 3). The ADT method performs slightly
better on E. coli metabolic enzymes, and DLR on S. cerevisiae. Success of the DLR method relative to a general classifier, such as ADT, suggests that the derived association
scores are largely consistent with the underlying assumptions of monotonicity and independence, and allow qual-

BMC Bioinformatics 2006, 7:177

ity predictions to be made based on a straightforward
evaluation of the score probability distributions. The ADT
method, however, does not require such assumptions,
and may be used to incorporate in the future a wide variety of unrestricted descriptors, such as sequence homology data or expression variability [19].
Prediction performance of individual functional association scores and their combination using ADT method is
shown for E. coli metabolic enzymes in Figure 4a. The figure illustrates that predictions based on the combined evidence are clearly superior to what is achieved by any
individual type of functional association evidence, with
43% of known enzymes predicted as number one candidates for their enzymatic function, and 60% within the
top 10 candidates. Associations based on the chromosome clustering provide the best predictions of any single
evidence type, and are able to predict almost half of the
metabolic enzymes within the top 10 candidates. It is also
important to note that different association evidence
types are not redundant â none of the predictions based
on a particular association score are completely covered
by the predictions of another association score (see Additional file 11). Predictions for 16 unknown and recently
identified enzyme-encoding genes that are specified as
missing in the E. coli metabolic model are given in Additional file 17.
Individual and combined prediction performance for
enzymes of S. cerevisiae metabolic network is illustrated in
Figure 4b. Relative to E. coli predictions, co-expression
score in S. cerevisiae tends to perform better; however
chromosome clustering and phylogenetic profile association scores perform worse. The overall level of performance is also lower, with approximately 60% of the
enzymes predicted within top 50 candidates (compared
to 71% in E. coli). The performance difference can be partially attributed to lower number of candidate genes in E.
coli (3351 as opposed to 5252 in S. cerevisiae) and wider
availability of the genomic data for bacterial organisms.
For instance, chromosome clustering associations were
calculated on a dataset that contains nearly a hundred
bacterial species and only a handful of eukaryotic
genomes.
As earlier studies have utilized pre-defined metabolic
pathways to establish functional context of a missing
gene, we compared performance of predictions based on
layered metabolic neighborhoods with predictions based
on KEGG pathway membership. A set of KEGG metabolic
pathways for a particular organism provides a list of reactions and enzymes analogous to the E. coli and S. cerevisiae
metabolic models used throughout this manuscript. Such
pathways also represent pre-defined, functionally meaningful partitions of the metabolic network. To compare

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/177

predictive performance, the candidates were evaluated
based on the functional associations with genes in the relevant KEGG pathway, instead of the metabolic network
neighborhood. We find that associations with layered
metabolic neighborhoods are more informative in both E.
coli and S. cerevisiae metabolic models than associations
with enzymes in shared KEGG pathways (Additional file
12). For E. coli the difference in fraction of predicted
enzymes is greatest at low self-ranks (200% at self-rank of
1), and decreases for higher self-ranks (18% at self-rank of
50). This is expected because metabolic neighborhoods
are determined specifically for the desired enzymatic function and prioritize neighbors into layers of decreasing
functional relevance.

Conclusion
The results presented in this work demonstrate that the
gene encoding a specific metabolic function can be effectively identified from combined functional association
with the metabolic network neighborhood of the desired
function. This indicates that the relationships established
by the local structure of the metabolic network impose
constraints on a wide range of natural processes, such as
gene expression or evolutionary processes on both molecular and genomic scales. Our tests used a combination of
genome context and expression data to identify known E.
coli metabolic enzymes, predicting them within the top 10
(out of 3352) candidates in 60% of the cases. We show
that in the case of both E. coli and S. cerevisiae, combining
multiple types of association evidence results in a significantly better prediction performance than that of any
individual association score.
In validating the performance of our method, we relied on
the functional associations established by the metabolic
network neighborhood as the sole source of information
about the desired enzymatic activity. In practice, additional clues regarding activity or physical properties of the
unidentified enzyme can be often used to narrow down
the set of candidates. These additional clues may provide
restrictions on the phylogenetic profile pattern, protein
size, presence or absence of membrane spanning regions
or specific protein domains. For example, the recently
identified E. coli arabinose-5-phosphate isomerase, yrbH
[55], is predicted as a 10th candidate among all genes, but
is the only candidate within the top 50 with a putative
sugar isomerase domain (see Additional file 17).
The presented approach is limited in its ability to predict
additional functions for the enzyme-encoding genes
already present in the metabolic model. Specifically, evaluating an enzyme-encoding gene from the metabolic
neighborhood of a desired enzymatic function as a candidate for that function, would typically result in a high

score regardless of whether the gene actually encodes a
desired enzyme.
Sequence homology to known proteins remains the primary method of identifying missing enzymes [4,56]. Predictions based on the association evidence considered in
this work are complementary to homology-based methods, and can be used to target enzymes that have not been
identified in any organism (referred to as globally missing
enzymes by Osterman et al. [4]). Integration of genome
context information into the refined sequence homology
searches has been shown to improve the predictions [6].
It will be important to analyze how incorporation of
diverse association evidence presented in this work would
improve the performance, in particular in with respect to
the difficult cases of weak or ambiguous sequence homology. The overall performance of the presented method can
be improved in a number of ways. The datasets underlying
individual scores can be expanded. Genome divergence
corrections for the chromosome clustering score are also
likely to improve the results. Further extensions can provide better identification in the cases where multiple missing genes appear within the same metabolic
neighborhood. This should be particularly helpful for
enzyme identification in poorly studied organisms. In
such organisms, the performance of the method will be
determined by how much is known about the metabolic
neighborhood of the specific enzymatic function. We
hope that the presented method, and its future derivations, will be important in completing metabolic models
of different organisms.

Methods
Metabolic neighborhoods and network representation
Metabolic network was represented as a graph, with nodes
corresponding to metabolic enzyme-encoding genes and
edges to connections established by the metabolic reactions [20]. Two metabolic genes are connected if the
enzymes they encode share a metabolite among the set of
reactants or products of the reactions they catalyze. Metabolic network distance between enzyme-encoding genes is
calculated as a shortest path in the graph. Distance of
directly connected genes is taken to be 1. A metabolic neighborhood layer of a radius R around a metabolic enzyme X
is defined as a set of all enzyme-encoding genes that are at
the distance R from the enzyme X. A metabolic neighborhood of radius R is a set of neighborhood layers of radii r
â¤ R (Figure 1a).

Detailed metabolic models of E. coli [2] and S. cerevisiae
[21] were used to compile comprehensive connectivity
graphs for these organisms, excluding metabolic connections established by the following top 14 most common
metabolites: ATP, ADP, AMP, CO2, CoA, glutamate, H,
NAD, NADH, NADP, NADPH, NH3, orthophosphate and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/177

pyrophosphate (and corresponding mitochondrial and
external species). Common metabolites tend to connect
enzymes with weak functional associations [20], and their
exclusion generally improves enzyme-encoding gene predictions. The exclusion threshold was chosen to cover
majority of common co-factors. We note that overall performance results are not sensitive to the exact set of
excluded metabolites (Additional file 13 compares selfrank performance excluding top 7 and top 20 metabolites). However, changes in the metabolite set can affect
prediction of individual enzymes, in particular those catalyzing key reactions of the excluded metabolites.
Self-rank validation
To assess performance of our method we use self-rank
measure, which quantifies the ability to predict known
metabolic enzymes. A self-rank of a known enzymeencoding gene is defined as a rank of that gene among a
set of candidates in an ordering determined by our algorithm (Figure 1b). A set of candidates consist of all genes
in the organism that do not already appear in the metabolic graph (i.e. non-metabolic genes) and the known
enzyme-encoding gene that is being tested. Candidate set
for E. coli contained 3351 open reading frames (ORFs),
and for S. cerevisiae 5252 ORFs. A perfect prediction algorithm would result in a self-rank of 1 (top candidate) for
every metabolic enzyme, and a completely non-informative method would result in a uniform distribution of
ranks (on the range from 1 to the size of the candidate
set).

The overall performance of the method was measured by
evaluating self-ranks of a set of known enzyme-encoding
genes. The test set includes all enzymes with non-empty
metabolic neighborhoods, with the following exceptions:
test set excludes enzymes from known multi-subunit
complexes, as strong functional association between
members of the same complex would lead to overestimation of algorithm performance; test set also excludes
enzymes that have high sequence homology (BLASTp E
value below 10-10) to some other known metabolic
enzyme in that organism (paralogs). The exclusion of
such paralogous pairs aims to avoid bias stemming from
overlapping ortholog mappings. The resulting set contained 351 enzymes from E. coli metabolism, and 240
from S. cerevisiae.
While paralog filtering allows to minimize bias from overlapping ortholog mappings, it also excludes a significant
fraction of known enzymes (50% for E. coli, 62% for S.
cerevisiae), which in itself can be a source of bias. To test
this we calculated algorithm performance omitting individual associations between paralogous gene pairs, as an
alternative to removing all paralogs from the test set. We
find that algorithm performance with and without para-

log filtering is comparable for both E. coli and S. cerevisiae
(see Additional file 15).
Orthology datasets
KEGG ortholog dataset was retrieved from SSDB database
(01/2005) [28]. All available closest homologs and best
bi-directional hits of E. coli and S. cerevisiae genes were
recorded. BLAST-based dataset was constructed using
BLASTp queries against NCBI NR protein dataset (03/
2005), using E-value cutoff of 10-3 and limiting the maximum number of homologs per query to 6000. To determine best bi-directional hits, reverse BLASTp queries were
run for every hit against target genome (E. coli or S. cerevisiae). NCBI taxonomy identifiers were used to group hits
belonging to the same organism. For E. coli only organisms containing orthologs to more than 4% of genes were
considered (7% for S. cerevisiae). We found that performance of analogous datasets constructed using TBLASTN
queries was similar.
Phylogenetic profile co-occurrence

Given a set of genomes G = {G1.. GNG }, a phylogenetic
profile of a gene was represented as a binary vector Îµ of
length NG, such that Îµi = 1 if an orthologous gene is
present in genome Gi, and Îµi = 0 otherwise.

Equation 1

where k is the number of ortholog co-occurrences, N is the
size of the genome set G, n and m correspond to the
number of orthologs in the two profiles being compared.
The probability of functional association is then given by

Passociation = 1 â

â P ( k | n, m, N ) , where K is the number

k>K

of actual ortholog co-occurrences observed between two
specific profiles [11].
If the assumption of identical ortholog distribution
within each genome is relaxed, probability P(k|n, m, N) is
distributed as a sum of independent, non-identical Bernoulli variables xi: k ~

â

min(n,m)

Given a gene x with ortholog occurrence profile Îµx, the
probability of observing k ortholog co-occurrences
between gene x and some other gene y, P(k|n, m, N), is calculated using the following recursive approach. Let
Pi(k'|m') be a probability of observing a total of k'
ortholog co-occurrences between gene x and some other
gene y in the genomes Gj such that j â¤ i (Gj:jâ¤i), where m' is
the number of orthologs of gene y in the genomes Gj:jâ¤i.
Then, by definition, P(k|n, m, N) = PN(k|m).
Let pio,mâ² be a probability of one of the remaining m'
orthologs of gene y occurring in genome Gi. Then Pi(k'|m')
can be calculated recursively by considering separately the
cases when an ortholog of gene y does or does not occur
in the genome Gi:
Pi(k'|m') = pio,mâ² Pi(k'|m', ortholog of y occurs in Gi) + (1 -

pio,mâ² )Pi(k'|m', ortholog of y does not occur in Gi)

Equa-

Assuming that orthologs are independently identically
distributed (IID) within each genome Gi, the probability
of observing two profiles of a given similarity under the
null hypothesis is calculated using hypergeometric distribution [25]:

where Îµix is the value of the ortholog occurrence profile
(0 or 1) of gene x in genome Gi.
Pi(k'|n', m') is computed using a dynamic programming
approach. The consideration of non-identical distribution
of ortholog frequency within each genome is then localized to pio,mâ² , which in this case is distributed according to
the marginal Extended Hypergeometric distribution. The
marginal form of the distribution is more amenable to the
computational approximations than the regular form.
Since pio,mâ² does not depend on the choice of genes x and
y, we sample pio,mâ² computationally, taking into account
individual ortholog occurrence frequencies of each
genome. The probability of ortholog occurrence in a specific genome ( pio,mâ² ) was sampled computationally by
Page 10 of 16

drawing from the set of organisms without replacement
with relative probabilities corresponding to the rate of
ortholog occurrences in each genome. In each iteration
draws were performed until all of the organisms were
drawn. A total of 106 such iterations were performed. The
sensitivity was assessed using E. coli phylogenetic profile
data (BLAST-based dataset). At 106 iterations, the mean
standard error of pio,mâ² is 3.0Â·10-4 (estimated from 100
independent runs). The mean standard error of the resulting self-ranks of known enzyme-encoding genes is 0.70,
and standard errors for the fraction of known enzymeencoding genes predicted below self-rank thresholds of
10, 20 and 50 is < 10-10, 8.5Â·10-4and 1.4Â·10-3 respectively.
To correct for non-independent ortholog occurrence rates,
we first evaluate the distance between a pair of query
genomes X and Y as:

d ( X,Y ) =

MI ( X , Y )

min ( H ( X ) , H ( Y ) )

Equation 4

where MI(X, Y) is mutual information between ortholog
occurrence vectors for genomes X and Y, and H() is Shannon entropy of each vector. The ortholog occurrence vector for a query genome X is a binary vector of length Ngenes
(number of genes in a target organism, i.e. E. coli), such
that value of the ith element is 1 if ortholog of an ith gene
is found in X, and 0 otherwise. Clusters of closely related
organisms (d(X, Y) < 0.8, Equation 4) were determined by
neighbor-joining method [57]. Several ways of summarizing the ortholog co-occurrence vector for a cluster of
closely related organisms were tested: selecting organism
with highest entropy, using AND/OR functions, and using
majority rule. We find that performance of AND function
is optimal for the threshold of d(X, Y) < 0.8, however for
higher thresholds selecting an organism with highest
entropy results in better performance.
In evaluating performance without adjacency-rank rescaling (i.e. Figure 2), total phylogenetic profile association
score between a candidate gene x and a metabolic neighborhood layer L was calculated as:

scoreL ( x ) =

1

â P ( x, g )

Equation 5

gâL

where P(x, g) is the probability of observing a given
number of ortholog co-occurrences between genes x and
g, calculated using hypergeometric or extended hypergeometric distribution. Functional form given in Equation 5
will assign high scores to candidates with strong functional associations (i.e. very low values of P(x, g)) to the
genes in the metabolic network neighborhood layer L.

Other functional forms, including those with optimized
parameters can be used ([19], Chen and Vitkup, submitted).
To estimate self-rank performance of the COG dataset correcting for the bias in orthology dataset coverage (Figure
2b), the fraction of true enzyme-encoding genes, f predicted within a particular self-rank threshold t was calculated as f(t) = Î±M f'(Î±Ct), where Î±M is the fraction of test
metabolic enzyme-encoding genes covered by the COG
dataset, Î±C is the fraction of candidate set genes (non-metabolic) covered by the dataset, and f' is the performance
on the set of metabolic and candidate genes covered by
the COG dataset.
Gene co-expression
Co-expression association value was calculated as Spearman rank correlation [58] between expression profiles. E.
coli co-expression was calculated based on the 180 conditions from the Stanford Microarray Database (SMD dataset) [59]. S. cerevisiae co-expression was measured based
on the mRNA expression profiles from Rosetta "compendium" dataset [60]. Log10 intensity ratio data was used.
Co-expression of orthologous genes was determined
using KEGG ortholog dataset.
Clustering on the chromosome
The degree to which orthologs of two genes are clustered
on the chromosome was calculated based on the null
hypothesis that genes are randomly distributed across the
chromosomes. Instead of considering gene sizes and exact
nucleotide positions, we concentrated on gene order statistics.

Given a pair of genes x and y, we define P(dg(x, y)) as the
probability of observing gene order distance dg(x, y) or
smaller between orthologs of genes x and y in a genome g.
Under the null hypothesis, P(dg(x, y)) is calculated
directly, by counting the number of gene pairs in the
organism g that are separated by gene order distance dg(x,
y) or smaller (taking into account chromosome sizes in g).
Clustering of genes x and y in a set of query genomes G
was calculated as PG ( x, y ) =

â P ( dg ( x, y ) ) . The associ-

gâG

ation strength between of a candidate gene x for a metabolic neighborhood layer Nl was calculated as

P ( x | Nl ) =

â PG ( x, y ) .

The above formulation is

yâNl

based on two major assumptions: (1) gene order distances
to different genes of the neighborhood layer Nl are independent, and (2) gene order distances between a specific
pair of genes are independent across different organisms.

Given a large number of genomes, this evaluation measure will be biased by the variable divergence of different
organisms from each other. For example, a set of genes
whose orthologs appear only in several closely-related
organisms will appear to be more clustered than the set of
genes spanning more distant genomes. General probabilistic correction for the genome divergence depends on the
details of the rearrangement regime, and presents considerable computational difficulties [38,61]. To minimize
the effect of variable genome divergence we have removed
from consideration genomes of closely related species. We
also note that the bias in the prediction performance is
likely to be minimal, as addition of 5 closely related species did not affect the results (data not shown).

Adjacency-rank score rescaling, metabolite weighting and
calculation of layer association scores
To perform adjacency-rank score rescaling of raw pairwise association values, we calculate likelihood ratio of
metabolic adjacency (alr) for a pair of genes x and y:

The results are based on a set of 105 bacterial and three
eukaryotic genomes (S. cerevisiae, S. pombe, C. elegans)
from Genbank. The set was screened to eliminate closely
related species using ortholog occurrence mutual information threshold of 0.9. Orthology mapping was established using KEGG-based dataset, with best bi-directional
hits.

We note that evaluation of chromosome clustering based
on the nucleotide positions (as opposed to gene order)
produces comparable results (see Additional file 14).
Protein interactions
Interaction likelihood ratios from the PIE dataset by
Jansen et al. [13] were used as pair-wise protein interaction association values.
Protein fusions
Two proteins x and y of a target genome (S. cerevisiae and
E. coli) were taken to be associated through a protein
fusion event if both of the following conditions were met:

1.) x and y are homologous to the same protein z in one
of the query genomes with a BLASTp E value below a specified threshold (Ethreshold), and with at least 70% of their
sequences aligned to z.
2.) x and y align to different regions of z, or to regions
overlapped by no more than 10% of the shorter protein
among x and y. If x or y align to multiple regions of z, then
any two regions must not overlap.
A set of 70 query genomes, based on the study by Bowers
et al. [11], was downloaded from the Entrez Genome database[62]. Several values of Ethreshold were used in generating
enzyme-encoding gene predictions (Figures 3 and 4), with
Ethreshold = 10-2, 10-5 and 10-10 for E. coli; Ethreshold = 10-3, 105 and 10-10 for S. cerevisiae.

, where P(D|M) is the probability

of observing existing associating evidence for a true

associative evidence scores are independent, we calculate
probabilities as P ( D ) = â Pe ( De ) , where Pe(De) corree

sponds to the posterior of evidence type e. The problem is
therefore transformed into estimating tails of association
score probability distributions over all genes, and
enzyme-encoding genes. For association scores derived
for different types of associating evidence and neighborhood layers these probabilities were evaluated empirically
from the gene counts, assuming that the likelihood of
association increases monotonically with the absolute
value of the score.
The self-rank evaluations of known E. coli and S. cerevisiae
metabolic enzyme-encoding genes (see Self-rank validation section in Methods) were performed using leave-oneout validation strategy. In other words, in each case, scores
of the candidate being evaluated are not included when
calculating P(M|D).
Alternating decision tree predictor
The mljava implementation of the AdaBoost algorithm
[51] was used to build ADT classifiers based on a set of
descriptors, corresponding to different association scores
with individual layers of the metabolic network neighborhood. The results presented in Figures 3 and 4 are based
on 10-fold validation, 100 iterations of boosting. The
training sets included data on only 60% of the true nega-

tive (non-metabolic) genes in order to minimize computational time. The candidate genes were prioritized
according to the value of the classification margin.
Predictions with combined association evidence
The self-rank performance illustrated in Figures 3 and 4
was calculated based on candidate association with first
three layers of metabolic network neighborhood (neighborhood radius = 3). Association with respect to each
layer was described by a separate association score. The
predictions were performed using association score ranks:
given a candidate gene x for a missing enzyme e, the value
of a descriptor was calculated as a rank of scoreL(x) in a set
of scores S = {scoreL(y)}yâC, where C is a set of all candidates for a missing enzyme e, with higher ranks corresponding to stronger associations. A list of association
scores used in combined evidence prediction for E. coli
and S. cerevisiae metabolic models is given in Table 1.
