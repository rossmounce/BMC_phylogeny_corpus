Abstract
For a neurobiologist, the core of human nature is the human cerebral cortex, especially the
prefrontal areas, and the question "what makes us human?" translates into studies of the
development and evolution of the human cerebral cortex, a clear oversimplification. In this
comment, after pointing out this oversimplification, I would like to show that it is impossible to
understand our cerebral cortex if we focus too narrowly on it. Like other organs, our cortex
evolved from that in stem amniotes, and it still bears marks of that ancestry. More comparative
studies of brain development are clearly needed if we want to understand our brain in its historical
context. Similarly, comparative genomics is a superb tool to help us understand evolution, but
again, studies should not be limited to mammals or to comparisons between human and
chimpanzee, and more resources should be invested in investigation of many vertebrate phyla.
Finally, the most widely used rodent models for studies of cortical development are of obvious
interest but they cannot be considered models of a "stem cortex" from which the human type
evolved. It remains of paramount importance to study cortical development directly in other
species, particularly in primate models, and, whenever ethically justifiable, in human.

Report
What makes us human?
A reader: "Gosh, who does he thinks he is, he who claims
to answer that question?"

Indeed, so complex is the question that one may legitimately wonder whether it is worth asking it. A check on
the internet as of this year (2006) returns different websites, from the reputed Smithsonian Institution to some
that sound rather like crackpots. Most religions will tell us
that Man was created by God and that our human condition will forever remain a mystery. Starting from a different viewpoint, information theory – and common sense –
teach us that understanding something requires more

analytical power than the object under investigation itself,
thus leading to a similar conclusion. As a scientist, however, I am drawn almost inexorably to think about our
"humanness" as a scientific question: even though there is
no global answer, it is a question about which we can at
least formulate ideas and hypotheses that can be checked
by observation (e.g. fossil record) or experiment. This
short commentary is aimed to those who share this
endeavour.
Let me begin with two preambles. First, even the standard
response "what makes us human is our brain" has obvious limitations. Imagine a creature with a human brain in
the body of an ape: would she/he feel human? Would we

Journal of Biomedical Discovery and Collaboration 2006, 1:16

regard her/him as human? Probably not: Being human is
indeed a status that relies on, and integrates many parameters: our brain and body, of course, but also our history
as a person and as a group, up to the social setting in
which we live [1]. Arguably, such remarks apply to the definition of all biological species, but they are particularly
striking for ours: it is not anthropomorphic to say that we
have reached a unique point of sophistication in our relationships to each other and to other creatures. This remark
made, I shall leave socio-biology aside – after all it is not
my field – and concentrate on the point of view of brain
development and evolution, about which I feel a bit less
ignorant.
The other preliminary point that I wish to discuss briefly
is the assumption "What makes our brain human, is our
cerebral cortex, and particularly prefrontal lobes".
Although I basically agree with this assertion as a first
approximation, it should be noted that the evolution and
development of cerebral cortical performances did not
occur in isolation. Rather, the process was contingent
upon the development of the nervous system and the rest
of the body as a whole. To mention the most celebrated
example: It is plain obvious that language is a defining
trait of our species; language requires evolutionary acquisition of specific features in the larynx, and of neurological coordination of laryngeal muscles and other structures
that are not related to the cerebral cortex, yet are unique to
our species. The same remark can be made about the
acquisition of hand skills and there are several other
examples. Organisms evolve as entities. For obvious operational reasons, we mostly study the evolution of parts.
But we should keep constantly in mind that, when it
comes to interpretation of data, it makes little sense to discuss parts without considering the whole.
The two nuances above being made, I think most of us
will agree that one of the main differences between us and
other animals lays in our cognitive abilities. Every dog
owner knows that animals have emotions or something
close to it. They can be sad or joyous, they have their temper. They remember – sometimes at least – what they are
taught. Chimpanzees can be trained, with much patience
and care, to read and learn elementary symbols. There are
countless anecdotes and observations indicating that elephants look depressed when loosing a mate, and may
show some signs of mourning, such as returning to visit
the site of death. Clearly, memory, intelligence, emotions,
consciousness or even a moral sense of right and wrong
are not absolutely unique to humans [2]. A recent report
even claims that mice show "empathy"[3]. But only in our
species have cognitive abilities reached a unique level of
sophistication. As far as we know, even when compared to
apes, we are the only creature who invented language, his
own written rules, who runs his social life with a moral

http://www.j-biomed-discovery.com/content/1/1/16

code of right and wrong, allowing us to propose that there
have been some (several?) quantum leap(s) during the
evolution of our brain, although there is much uncertainty about the stages in our evolution when these leaps
occurred.
If we differ from animals in general, and from apes in particular, by our cognitive capacity, in which our cerebral
cortex plays a key part, I would reformulate the question
"What makes us human?", and ask: "What is so special
about our brain and cerebral cortex"?
Man has a large brain. Some animals have larger ones,
but, mostly, man has the largest brain weight when allometric correction is made for body size. Animals with the
largest brains include cetaceans and elephants that we
regard generally as intelligent. Interestingly, chimpanzee
and gorilla score average for their brain size relative to
body weight [4].
Studies of cranial endocasts indicate quite clearly that
Neanderthal had larger cranial capacity and presumably
larger brains than us. Brain size, although of obvious
importance, is not everything. Cetaceans, even small ones
such as Dolphins, have huge brains, with large and foliated cortical surfaces. Their temporal lobes are larger than
ours, and this could be related to their fantastic spatial
memory. Yet their cognitive skills, although far from negligible, cannot be compared to ours. The neocortex in
cetaceans retains many features of its ancestral character
such as a relatively low number of granular interneurons,
and a relatively simple neuronal differentiation (dendrite
trees). Phylogenetic isolation may have resulted in development of the nervous system chiefly by increase in nerve
cell numbers (associated with great cortical expansion),
by quantitative expansion without substantial architectonic evolution [5]. Neuronal numbers may not systematically vary linearly with cortical size or surface. In contrast
to cetaceans, human neurons are characterized by a most
elaborate architectonic organization, by a high proportion of some neuronal types, such as Cajal's "double bouquet" cell [6], and by its exquisite connectivity. Again,
such parameters do not necessarily correlate with neuronal numbers and are obviously inaccessible to measurements of endocasts.
Genes that control development are preferential targets of
the evolutionary process, and I would argue that the identification and study of mechanisms that regulate cortical
development in different species are central to understanding our cortex. For example, developmental studies
over the last ten years or so have clearly shown that the
two main neuronal populations of the mammalian cortex, namely excitatory glutamatergic pyramidal cells and
GABAergic interneurons are generated in different sectors

of ventricular zones and migrate to the cortex along different routes. As schematized in Fig 1, the main body of cortical neurons form glutamatergic cells that migrate
radially, whereas GABAergic cells generated in the ganglionic eminence, primarily the medial part (MGE), migrate
to the cortex tangentially [7-9]. Whereas this developmental pattern is well established in rodents, it is also
described in chick [10] and it may thus be a general feature of all amniotes. On the other hand, in the human
brain, in addition to the MGE, GABAergic interneurons
are also generated in the cortical VZ and migrate radially
to the cortex [11]. Clearly, even though this has already
been extensively studied, more works need to be done on
the origin of cortical interneurons in different species.

brain development – remains rudimentary [9]. This field
has been neglected by grant agencies – and by most scientists – for several decades, being pursued only by a few
dedicated colleagues. Yet, if we accept that the question of
human origins and humanness are relevant, then I would
argue that systematic comparative studies of brain anatomy and development, using state of the art techniques,
are urgently needed and should be appropriately supported. A few years ago, a Human Brain Project was proposed, but I no not believe we should focus too narrowly
on the human, and even on the mammalian cortex, which
will be best understood in its evolutionary context. "Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution" (Dobzansky, [12]).

One would think that solid data are available in the literature and can help us answer most of the comparative
questions stated above? Not at all: our knowledge of comparative brain anatomy – not to mention comparative

It is our brain that makes us human, and our brain develops under control of our genetic makeup. Hence the saying: "Our "humanness" is in our genes". This leads us to
believe that, by comparing DNA sequences, we might be

able to pick up human specific features and explain the
whole thing. There is currently a lot of publicity about the
comparison between the human and chimpanzee
genomes. It is widely thought that the subtle genetic differences thus defined will point to key genetic determinants of the human species. Although these studies are
fascinating and necessary, and will undoubtedly yield
considerable insight, I believe this reasoning is somewhat
simplistic. There is rarely an evident correlation between a
genetic difference and the resulting phenotypic effects: a
change that would be considered almost irrelevant may
very well be most important, and vice versa. The genetic
program (mostly DNA sequences) is not the phenotype,
as the latter results from running the genetic program during development, and is the product of epigenetic history.
During development, the epigenetic landscape unfolds in
a highly non linear and massively parallel fashion, making it difficult to understand relationships a posteriori,
and usually impossible to predict outcome from basic
principles. Our brain evolved by natural selection, that is
the survival of phenotypes (hence genomes) with the
highest rate of reproduction and best suited to changing
environments. The evolutionary history of the vertebrate
brain is poorly understood because brain tissue does not
fossilize, but also because research in comparative developmental neurobiology is still in its infancy as outlined
above. The cortex may have been absent in early vertebrates: It is reduced to a periventricular layer in anamniotic vertebrates. The cortex increased in size and
organization in stem amniotes, the ancestors of living reptiles, birds and mammals [9]. It gained prominence in
synapsids, the lineage leading to mammals, and evolved
explosively in primates. Evolution from our common
ancestor with apes is only the latest major radiation in this
ongoing process, and this latest step and recent brain evolution did not evolve from scratch. "Evolution is a tinkerer" [13] and can only build on a prior structure. If we
want to understand brain evolution, we need to tackle
DNA sequences, like the fossil record, in their historical
perspective and avoid focusing narrowly. I very much
doubt that we can understand the genetic control of the
human brain without addressing basic genetic mechanisms in living animals that belong to as many branches
of the tree as possible. It might even be possible to rescue
enough DNA from fossil material, although I doubt its
quality will be sufficient. Examples of what I think are elegant approaches are the work of the Haussler group on
ultraconserved elements present in the genome of human
and several other vertebrates [14], that led to identification of 'human accelerated regions', HAR1, and of a novel
RNA gene (HAR1F) that is expressed specifically in CajalRetzius neurons in the developing human neocortex [15],
and a recent study of human lineage-specific gene amplification [16]. But this is only an encouraging beginning
and a lot remains to be done.

After the sequencing of the human and mouse genomes,
obvious biomedical priorities, I thought that sequencing
centers would pursue with amphioxus, a fish, a frog, a turtle, a snake or lizard, Sphenodon, chick, a crocodilian,
etc... But this is not what happened ! Rather, genome
sequencing is under way or almost completed for several
horses, cattle, dogs, cats and other pets. As often, economic considerations and non scientific arguments prevail. But this can be changed and the price and speed of
sequencing allows a wider perspective. If we believe that
the questions of human origins and humanness are relevant, then concerted sequencing efforts to investigate as
many branches of the tree as possible should be funded
and undertaken actively. By comparing sequences on a
global phylogenetic scale, we might be able to identify
some of the unique, subtle genetic changes that are specific and essential to the evolution of the primate lineage
and to the development of the human cortex.
The rapid increase of brain size and complexity during
recent evolution in the primate lineage is well known and
widely discussed elsewhere. To many, such changes in
brain size in such a short time appear difficult to explain
by natural selection. I believe this view is wrongly based
on a sort of subconscious postulate that evolution works
more or less linearly, namely that small changes in phenotypes reflect minor changes in the DNA, whereas large
changes in phenotypes require huge modifications in
DNA. But why should it be so, when high non linearity is
in fact the rule rather than the exception. Like development, evolution works in a most non linear way. Whether
this non linearity is chaotic will remain forever unknown,
as we cannot rewind the tape and we have no way to produce evolution experimentally, except for a few very small
and limited cases. But the point is that evolution is highly
non linear, and I think some recent experimental observations can be interpreted in this frame of mind. Let me give
a few examples.
The process of increased cortical surface by foliation is
generally considered essential during evolution towards
the human cortex. As I hinted to above, this was not the
sole mechanism used by evolution to increase cortical performance, but few will doubt its importance. The process
is often assumed to be complex, because it appears as such
to our investigations. Yet, cortical folding can vary widely
within closely related lineages, as can be appreciated by
consulting the superb website "Comparative Mammalian
Brain Collections" [17]. For example, in monotremes,
Echidna has an elaborate, highly foliated cortex, whereas
Platypus is almost lissencephalic [18]. Similar examples
can be found in other phyla, including primates, some of
which are almost lissencephalic. Furthermore, a mixture
of brain hypertrophy with variable levels of gyrated cortex
is artificially accomplished in mice by elegant, yet rela-

tively simple manipulations [19], such as germline inactivation of caspases 3 or 9 [20,21], increased expression of
beta-catenin in transgenic mice [22,23], incubation of
embryonic cortex in vitro in the presence of lysophosphatidic acid [24,25], or manipulation of ephrin/Eph signaling [26]. Intriguingly, mice with inactivation of the
phosphatase PTEN [27], and with brain-specific inactivation of alpha-catenin [28] have brain hypertrophy, but no
or very little increased cortical foliation, showing that
brain size, cell numbers and foliation are not always correlated. The cerebellum of Mormyrid fishes, with its large
size and extensive foliation [4], provides yet another
example indicating that huge increase in surface of a cortex can probably evolve or be produced quite easily.
These observations suggest that the production of a
gyrated surface does not need extensive genetic changes,
and could have evolved in any phylum. But it did not
evolve very often, and I see at least two reasons for this,
that can be tested experimentally or by comparative studies. First, acquiring a large foliated cortex may be relatively
easy, but it may be more difficult to make this large cortex
work efficiently. Transgenic mice with increased cortex are
often not viable and, although this remains to be studied
in detail, the resulting large cortex does probably not work
well. This illustrates the point made above, that evolution
of the brain does not occur in isolation but in the context
of the whole organism. An increase in cortical size must be
accompanied with balanced growth of the mesodermal
components that support and vascularize the brain. Also,
the increase in cortical surface and the organization of
many adjacent radial cortical columns may increase neuronal excitability and susceptibility to seizures. A consequence of a highly geometrical arrangement of radial
cortical columns is to facilitate modifications of the membrane potential by field effects ("ephaptic" interactions),
largely believed to be involved in the oscillations of electrocortical rhythms and in generation of seizures [29].
This quasi crystalline arrangement presumably has advantages in terms of computational power, but also comes at
a price, as ephaptic excitation facilitates the tangential
spreading of activity and decreases the threshold for aberrant epileptic discharges. The second reason, not in contradiction with the first, may be more important. Namely,
the acquisition of a large brain and particularly of a large
foliated cortex may not be an evolutionary advantage per
se. Most species that are hugely successful in the evolutionary sense do not have a large brain or high cognitive
power. Large brain size and increased computational
power presumably proved evolutionary useful quite
recently, in early Homo, and the reason why this parameter was selected positively at some point in our phylogenetic history remains unknown. Perhaps, like several
traits, increased cortical surface was just "tried" at some
point in the primate lineage and, once the track had been

http://www.j-biomed-discovery.com/content/1/1/16

taken, there was little choice but to keep the option,
because it would have cost much more to turn back than
to continue. The option finally paid off, as humans are
obviously a very successful species, at least at this moment
and provided we do not end it all ourselves by burning or
exploding the planet.
Contrary to common belief, stem mammals probably did
not have a rodent-like forebrain. Rodents are highly
evolved animals that are not directly related to stem mammals, from which the lineage leading to primates is in fact
more directly derived [30]. Although this is not proven, I
consider it likely that stem mammals had a relatively
unspecialized, basic cortex, possibly with some foliation,
from which highly specialized lissencephalic cortices
evolved in lineages such as rodent, whereas other lineages
kept some foliation and even increased it in some
branches, most notably ours. It is generally accepted that
evolution works more easily on relatively undifferentiated
forms [31] and that neoteny of primates was a contributing factor to their rapid evolution. If this view is correct,
then the mouse cortex is not a model of the "primitive"
cortex of stem mammals, and inferences from mouse data
in terms of cortical evolution should be made with appropriate caution.
Another illustration that the mouse, with all its advantages, should not be considered the sole model for cortical
development and evolution concerns the role of CajalReztius cells, early neurons in the cortical marginal zone
that degenerate massively around birth [32]. Studies in
reeler and other mutant mice and human genetic studies
clearly demonstrate that Reelin secreted by Cajal-Retzius
cells is absolutely required for normal cortical development in mice and for foliation of the human cortex [33].
Yet, in mice, genetic ablation of most of Cajal-Retzius cells
does not perturb cortical development much, indicating a
large redundancy [34]. Although this remains to be studied further, it seems that there is a huge excess of CajalRetzius cells and of Reelin in rodents, and that this is not
the case in the human, where a provision of Reelin seems
to be provided over an extended period of time in the
marginal zone [35].
As discussed above, the unique cognitive power of the
human brain seems to be due to the evolutionary acquisition of multiple factors such as high neuronal number,
large foliated cortex, optimal architectonic organization,
complex neuronal types, highly organized and elaborate
connections. The evolution of the human brain has proceeded at amazing speed. We have reached a stage where
our cognitive capacity increases more through technological innovation, and cultural evolution vastly outpaces
biological evolution. However, I see no reason why brain
evolution should stop at the present human level and it is

impossible to escape the question of its future. Without
going into science fiction, I would like to mention one
feature of the cerebral cortex that receives scant attention
– it is in fact generally ignored – and that I find very
intriguing, namely the subpial granular layer (SGL). The
SGL, is a transient contingent of cells that are apparently
generated from a basal region, close to the hilus of the sylvian fissure and the paleoventricle, and migrate tangentially in the subpial cortical marginal zone during midand late gestation. The SGL is much more developed in
human than other mammals, to the point that it is sometimes considered human-specific, even though a diminutive SGL has now been described in other mammals.
Initially described more than a century ago by Ranke, the
SGL was examined in some detail by Brun [36], who concluded that its cells differentiate into glia and/or probably
die after entering the cortical ribbon radially. A more
recent study indicated that the SGL cells are likely neuronal and enter the cortex radially [37], but remained inconclusive about their fate. By analogy with the development
of the external and internal granular layers of the cerebellum, a reasonable hypothesis could be that subpial neurons contribute to the cortical neuronal population but
that this went undetected because it represents a minority
of neurons. The SGL might provide a source of interneurons in addition to the main contingent that originates
from the ganglionic eminences. Like in the cerebellum, an
increase in SGL cells could result in an increase in surface
and folding of the cerebral cortical surface and, who
knows, result in a cerebral cortex with increased computational power. Even though the SGL is best studied in man,
the idea that it could play a role during cortical development and evolution is not pure speculation. Some diminutive SGL is present in mammalian models and
techniques are available to define better the cellular constitution of the SGL and the fate of its cells after they enter
the cortex, to identify their repertoire of gene expression,
the transcription factors implicated in their differentiation.

not be understood if excluded from this evolutionary context. If we want to understand better our cerebral cortex,
more efforts should be invested in comparative studies of
embryonic development, using state of the art technologies. Genomic sequencing efforts should be directed at all
branches of the vertebrate tree rather than focused narrowly on mammals. Finally, the rodent cortex is not a perfect model of the stem mammalian cortex and specific
studies of primate and human cortices are necessary. In
addition to its fundamental interest, an improved scientific knowledge of human nature will help us define better
our place and thus our rights and our duty in relation to
our environment and to ourselves. This is after all the ultimate ecological challenge!

I am convinced that we should not limit ourselves to the
analysis of the mouse and non mammalian species, but
that we should also study actively brain development in
primates, and particularly in human, using state of the art
techniques. Of course, ethical considerations are of the
utmost importance and must be taken into account. But
studies of brain development in primates and man, using
the whole arsenal of modern technology are a unique way
to trace novel, original avenues and to address scientifically the question of the evolution of our cerebral cortex,
and of our biological nature.
