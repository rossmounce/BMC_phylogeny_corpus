Abstract
Background: The outermost layer of the bacterial surface is of crucial importance because it is in
constant interaction with the host. Glycopeptidolipids (GPLs) are major surface glycolipids present
on various mycobacterial species. In the fast-grower model organism Mycobacterium smegmatis,
GPL biosynthesis involves approximately 30 genes all mapping to a single region of 65 kb.
Results: We have recently sequenced the complete genomes of two fast-growers causing human
infections, Mycobacterium abscessus (CIP 104536T) and M. chelonae (CIP 104535T). We show here
that these two species contain genes corresponding to all those of the M. smegmatis "GPL locus",
with extensive conservation of the predicted protein sequences consistent with the production of
GPL molecules indistinguishable by biochemical analysis. However, the GPL locus appears to be
split into several parts in M. chelonae and M. abscessus. One large cluster (19 genes) comprises all
genes involved in the synthesis of the tripeptide-aminoalcohol moiety, the glycosylation of the
lipopeptide and methylation/acetylation modifications. We provide evidence that a duplicated
acetyltransferase (atf1 and atf2) in M. abscessus and M. chelonae has evolved through specialization,
being able to transfer one acetyl at once in a sequential manner. There is a second smaller and
distant (M. chelonae, 900 kb; M. abscessus, 3 Mb) cluster of six genes involved in the synthesis of the
fatty acyl moiety and its attachment to the tripeptide-aminoalcohol moiety. The other genes are
scattered throughout the genome, including two genes encoding putative regulatory proteins.
Conclusion: Although these three species produce identical GPL molecules, the organization of
GPL genes differ between them, thus constituting species-specific signatures. An hypothesis is that
the compact organization of the GPL locus in M. smegmatis represents the ancestral form and that
evolution has scattered various pieces throughout the genome in M. abscessus and M. chelonae.

Background

Results

Mycobacterium abscessus and M. chelonae are both species
of rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM) that have
emerged as significant pathogens in humans during the
last ten years: both species are major causes of skin and
soft tissue infections following medical or surgical procedures [1]; M. abscessus also causes pulmonary infections
and is increasingly recovered from patients with cystic
fibrosis [1]. M. chelonae and M. abscessus are among the
most-antibiotic resistant RGM species [1] and this has
serious consequences for therapy [2].

Biochemical analysis of the glycopeptidolipid produced by
M. abscessus and M. chelonae
Since GPL molecules may differ at a structural level, we
first assessed the GPL status of the strains used in this
study for comparative genomic analysis: M. smegmatis
mc2155, M. chelonae CIP 104535T and M. abscessus CIP
104536T. Strains were grown in both early exponential
and late stationary phases (Fig. 2A) and lipids were
extracted from cells [11]. The GPLs were identified by
thin-layer chromatography (TLC), a method separating
molecules according to their hydrophobic index, and
using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of
flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry analysis [11].
Since GPLs contain sugar moieties, GPL-like compounds
were identified by anthrone staining [7]. Whatever the
growth phase, the three strains produced similar diglycosylated GPLs, and in comparable quantities; however, triglycosylated GPLs were clearly more abundant in M.
chelonae and M. abscessus than in M. smegmatis in both
conditions (Fig. 2A). The precise nature of the GPL-like
compounds was resolved by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, a very accurate and sensitive method for detecting
glycolipids. The molecular masses of all the GPL-associated pseudomolecular ions peaks detected in the mass
spectra of all strains perfectly matched the previously calculated molecular weights of the GPLs in these strains.
Most of the GPLs produced by M. smegmatis mc2155 were
diglycosylated forms, confirming earlier reports [15]. M.
abscessus and M. chelonae produced the same diglycosylated GPLs ([M+K+] m/z at 1273 amu), and in addition
produced a higher amount of triglycosylated GPLs than
M. smegmatis ([M+K+] m/z at 1419 amu) as expected from
TLC analysis (Fig. 2B).

Glycopeptidolipids (GPLs) are surface lipids found on a
number of mycobacterial species including both RGM
(e.g., M. smegmatis, M. chelonae, M. abscessus) and slow
growing mycobacteria (e.g., M. avium subsp. avium).
These molecules can make up more than 70% of the lipids
exposed at the bacterial surface (for a review see [3-5]).
They have a glycosylated lipopeptide core that is variably
modified by O-methylation and O-acetylation (Fig. 1).
More precisely, the GPL structure is based on a tripeptideaminoalcohol (D-Phe-D-allo-Thr-D-Ala-L-alaninol) Nlinked to a long chain fatty acyl residue. This lipopeptide
core is substituted by a 6-deoxytalosyl (dTal) unit linked
to the allo-Thr residue and by an O-methylated rhamnosyl
unit linked to the terminal alaninol residue. The dTal residue can be O-acetylated on positions 3 and 4, further glycosylated on position 2 in M. avium, whereas the fatty acyl
moiety and the rhamnosyl residue can be modified with
one and three methyl groups on positions 2, 3, or 4,
respectively and in some cases further glycosylated by the
addition of an extra rhamnosyl unit [3,11,6] (Fig. 1).
GPLs are required for sliding motility, biofilm formation
and for maintaining cell wall integrity [7,8]. They also
influence bacterial aggregation [7,9], induce the release of
prostaglandin E2 and interfere with the interaction
between mycobacteria and human monocytes/macrophages [10,11]. Moreover, several recent studies show that
natural variants of M. abscessus, which produce only small
amounts of GPL are more invasive than the high-level
producers [12-14]. Thus, GPLs appear to play an important role in both the physiology and the pathogenicity of
mycobacteria.
The complete genomes of M. chelonae (CIP 104535T) and
M. abscessus (CIP 104536T) have recently been sequenced
to help to elucidate their molecular mechanisms of pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance. By exploiting available
data concerning the genetic basis of the GPL biosynthetic
pathway in the RGM model organism, M. smegmatis, we
identified and analysed the genetic regions encoding
enzymes involved in GPL biosynthesis in M. chelonae and
M. abscessus.

Comparative genomics of the GPL biosynthetic pathway
Comparative genomic analysis was performed by pairwise
alignments of the proteins of the GPL locus of M. smegmatis and each of the complete proteomes of M. abscessus and
M. chelonae [16,17]. All the genes necessary for GPL biosynthesis are clustered in a single region of the M. smegmatis genome, thus constituting a true "GPL locus" (Figure
3). In this species, most of the genes of the locus (Fig. 1)
have been identified experimentally and/or by in silico
prediction (Table 1). The tripeptide-aminoalcohol moiety
is non-ribosomally assembled by the product of the mps1
and the mps2 genes [18,19], and the lipid synthesis and
attachment to the tripeptide-aminoalcohol moiety probably require the concerted action of several gene products
(pks, fadD23, papA3) [19,20]. The genes involved in the
glycosylation of the lipopeptide core (gtf1, gtf2) were
recently characterized by selectively inactivating them
both and by biochemical analysis of the resulting mutants
[21]. Triglycosylated GPLs, described as being produced
mostly during stationary phase [22], result from the addi-

between 30 and 89%, with two-thirds of M. chelonae/M.
abscessus orthologs being ≥70% identical to their M. smegmatis counterparts. Identity is less than 50% for only four
orthologs: sap, ecf, Rv0926 and Rv1174c. The functions of
Rv0926 and Rv1174c are not known, sap and ecf may play
roles in the regulation of GPL biosynthesis, and were this
the case, it would suggest that the regulatory circuits in
these species have diverged.

tion of an extra rhamnosyl residue (gtf3) [9,21]. The genes
involved in the O-methylation of the various hydroxyl
groups of the rhamnosyl unit (rmt2, rmt3 and rmt4) and
of the lipid moiety (fmt) of the GPLs have been characterized using similar methods [23-25]. The atf gene product
is responsible for acetylating two particular hydroxyl residues of the dTal [26], and FadE5 probably introduces the
double bond into the fatty acid. The rmlA and rmlB genes
are associated with the activation and epimerisation of the
sugars [27]. Two members of the mmpL family, a group of
genes encoding large membrane proteins, are also
required for GPL biosynthesis [19,26]. The exact function
of these proteins, MmpL4a and MmpL4b, is not known in
detail although a recent study performed in M. tuberculosis
suggests that MmpL proteins (MmpL7) may channel the
polyketide products during their synthesis by the
polyketide synthase, coupling synthesis and export [28].
Finally, the transport of the GPLs to the surface of the
bacilli involves the integral membrane protein Gap [19].
This locus also contains eight other genes that have not yet
been experimentally characterized: two encode membrane proteins (mmpS4 and mmpL10) that may also interact with the polyketide synthase of the cluster, two encode
a sigma factor and a sigma-associated protein (ecf and sap,
respectively) that are believed to contribute to the regulation of GPL production, and four have no known function
(Table 1 and Fig. 1) [18,19].
All the genes of the M. smegmatis GPL locus have close
orthologs in both M. chelonae and M. abscessus (Table 1).
These orthologs share more than 80% of identity with
each other and most are more than 90% identical (data
not shown). The percentage of identity between M. chelonae/M. abscessus and M. smegmatis orthologs ranges

Unlike M. smegmatis, the M. chelonae/M. abscessus GPL
orthologs are not gathered in a single region (Figure 3). In
both M. chelonae and M. abscessus, there is a large region
containing 19 genes (mmpS4 to gap). This region contains
all genes involved in the synthesis of the tripeptide-aminoalcohol moiety, the glycosylation of the lipopeptide
and the O-methylation and O-acetylation modifications
(see also Fig. 1). This region is very similar to the corresponding region of the M. smegmatis GPL locus, except for
the two following differences. First, there is no mobile element, either upstream of mbtH like in M. smegmatis
mc2155 or at any other location. Second, there are two atf
orthologs (we called them atf1 and atf2) in both M. chelonae and M. abscessus: atf1 is at the same location as atf in
M. smegmatis whereas atf2 is inserted between rmlB and
rmt2. M. chelonae atf1 and atf 2 genes are 58% identical
(71% similarity), and are 76 and 60% identical to M.
smegmatis atf respectively (88 and 75% similarity respectively); M. abscessus atf1 and atf 2 genes are 57% identical
(72% similarity), and are 72 and 59% identical to atf
respectively (83 and 74% similarity respectively). There is
a smaller region forming a block of 6 genes 900 kb from
this first region in M. chelonae and 3 Mb away in M. abscessus. These six genes (pks to gap-like) are probably involved
in the lipid synthesis and attachment to the tripeptideaminoalcohol moiety (e.g., pks, fadD23, papA3), but pks is
the only one that has been experimentally studied so far
[19]. This block is part of a large region that is inverted
between M. chelonae and M. abscessus. It is very similar to
the corresponding part of the M. smegmatis GPL locus
except that the order of the pe and the fadD23 genes is
switched in M. chelonae/M. abscessus relative to M. smegmatis. Finally, four genes closely linked in M. smegmatis
(Rv0926, fadE5, sap, ecf) are scattered on the chromosome
in M. chelonae and M. abscessus, with distances differing
between
species.
To test whether the locus organization was a particularity
of the sequenced strains (CIP 104535T and CIP
104536T), 5 clinical isolates of each species were analyzed
by PCR using two couples of primers (Additional file 1).
All the M. abscessus and M. chelonae isolates had the same
PCR pattern. This experiment shows that the genetic
organization of the GPL locus depicted in Figure 3 is not
strain-dependant but is probably valid for the whole species.

Acetyltransferases have evolved specificity in M. abscessus
and M. chelonae
As seen above, there is only one atf in M. smegmatis while
there are two in both M. abscessus and M. chelonae. In M.
smegmatis, Atf catalyses the transfer of two acetyl groups
onto the dTal moiety (on positions 3 and 4) [26]. We consequently tested whether the presence of the 2 atf in the
other species was a redundant or specialization process
and used atf1 and atf2 of M. abscessus as a model. We used
a M. smegmatis atf- mutant as a recipient host and complemented it with constructs expressing the various atf genes
(Additional file 2). The GPLs produced by the various
complemented strains were analysed by both TLC and
MALDI-TOF. The GPLs produced by the M. smegmatis atfmutant were, as expected, non O-acetylated ([M+K+] m/z
at 1189 and 1215 amu) as deduced from the value of the
masses of the pseudomolecular ions and its altered migration on TLC. Reintroduction of the atf gene of M. smegmatis led to the production of O-diacetylated GPL ([M+K+]
m/z at 1273 and 1299 amu) with a wild type migration

pattern. Complementation by the atf1 gene of M. abscessus
was enabling the production of mono-O-acetylated GPL
([M+K+] m/z at 1231 and 1258 amu) having an intermediary migration between the di-O-acetylated and the nonacetylated forms, indicating a specialisation process. Surprisingly, the GPL produced by the M. smegmatis atfmutant complementated by the atf2 gene of M. abscessus
was most exclusively non-acetylated as judged by TLC
(Additional file 2) and MALDI-TOF analysis confirmed
molecular masses of 1189 and 1215 amu (data not
shown). However, when both atf1 and atf2 were simultaneously introduced into the host strain, the production of
di-O-acetylated GPLs was restored as judged by TLC
(Additional file 2) and MALDI-TOF analysis confirmed
molecular masses of 1273 and 1299 amu (data not
shown). This set of experiments shows that the atf2 gene
of M. abscessus is fully functional and needs a mono-Oacetylated dTal substrate to be able to transfer the second
acetyl moiety. In conclusion, the acetyltransferases
encoded by the M. abscessus GPL locus are not redundant

Discussion

systems [29,30]. Surprisingly, M. chelonae and M. abscessus
produced clearly more triglycosylated GPL than M. smegmatis. This observation argues in favour of differences in
gtf3 expression in these three species.

This study is the first addressing the genetics of GPL biosynthesis in two clinically significant RGM species, M. chelonae and M. abscessus. The major observation is that,
despite producing structurally identical GPL molecules,
the genes necessary for its biosynthesis are organized very
differently. In M. smegmatis, the GPL locus is made up of
almost 30 genes in a region of ~65 kb, and therefore does
not comply with the prokaryotic rule of 1 gene/kb. This is
because GPL biosynthesis involves very large multi-modular proteins, for example the non-ribosomal protein synthetases (Mps1 and Mps2) and the polyketide synthase
(Pks), and consequently very long genes. Several genes
appear to be organized into operons, one of which has
been identified formally and contains mbtH, mps1, mps2,
gap, sap and ecf [19]. Interestingly, a mobile element,
IS1096, is located just upstream from mbtH in mc2155
strain. This upstream region corresponds to the promoter
of the mbtH operon and may therefore interfere with the
expression of this operon, as it does in other biological

All the genes are clustered in M. smegmatis, but are scattered in several blocks in M. chelonae and M. abscessus. The
various genomic pieces correspond to blocks of function:
one block corresponds to the synthesis of the tripeptideaminoalcohol moiety, the glycosylation of the lipopeptide and O-methylation/acetylation modifications, and
another to lipid biosynthesis and its attachment to the
tripeptide-aminoalcohol moiety. In addition, these species differ by one inversion and one duplication. An
attractive hypothesis is that the compact organization of
the GPL locus in M. smegmatis represents the ancestral
form and that evolution has scattered various pieces
throughout the genome in M. abscessus and M. chelonae.
However, the opposite hypothesis in which genes
involved in a metabolic pathway would have the tendency
to gather during evolution cannot be excluded. The fact
that both M. chelonae and M. abscessus have two nonredundant O-acetyltransferases suggests that atf2 may

have arisen from the duplication of atf1. Interestingly, atf1
is less similar to atf2 than to M. smegmatis atf, also indicating a functional divergence between atf1 and atf2. In M.
smegmatis, atf mediates the O-acetylation of the dTal in
both positions 3 and 4. We showed that, in M. abscessus,
atf1 and atf2 are each specifically responsible for one of
these two reactions and that probably act sequentially.
We showed that the GPL biosynthetic pathway is highly
conserved between M. chelonae and M. abscessus, consistent with the close relatedness of these two species [31].
However, due to genomic rearrangements between the
two species, the two blocks are located at different coordinates and the block of six genes is inverted in these two
species with respect to that in M. smegmatis. These
genomic rearrangements are consistent with the separation of the two species that were formerly parts of a single
complex [31]. We showed, using a panel of clinical isolates that these differences are species-specific, and may
thus be used as a discriminative marker. The genomic
findings are in agreement with the biochemical data
showing that the two species produce structurally identical GPL molecules [3]. However, differences in terms of
regulation cannot be excluded and it is not known

whether additional genes are needed for GPL biosynthesis, export and regulation in these three species.
M. chelonae and M. abscessus, like other mycobacterial species [32,33], can naturally switch from a rough (R) to
smooth (S) and from a S to a R morphotype [12,13]. R
strains are associated with a low GPL production, high
invasive ability and a higher virulence in the mouse
model [13,14]. However, despite several attempts, the
genetic bases for this natural S/R switching remain
obscure. Several studies using M. avium and M. smegmatis
describe various genes involved in the transition between
S and R morphotypes, most of which are implicated in the
GPL biosynthetic pathway [18,19,34]. The identification
of the genes required for the synthesis and export of these
metabolites should help our understanding of the natural
variation in the morphology and virulence variation of
these species.

Conclusion
We showed that M. abscessus and M. chelonae contain
genes corresponding to all those of the M. smegmatis "GPL
locus" with an extensive conservation of the predicted
protein sequences. This finding is consistent with the pro-

duction of GPL molecules indistinguishable by either
thin-layer chromatography or mass spectrometry.
Despite, the genomic and structural homology, the GPL
locus appears to be split into several parts in M. chelonae
and M. abscessus. One large cluster (19 genes) comprises
all genes involved in the synthesis of the tripeptide-aminoalcohol moiety, the glycosylation of the lipopeptide
and O-methylation/acetylation modifications. A second
smaller and distant (M. chelonae, 900 kb; M. abscessus, 3
Mb) cluster of six genes is involved in the synthesis of the
fatty acyl moiety and its attachment to the tripeptide-aminoalcohol moiety. The other genes are scattered throughout the genome, including two genes encoding putative
regulatory proteins. Although these three species produce
identical GPL molecules, the organization of GPL genes
differs between them, thus constituting species-specific
signatures. An attractive hypothesis is that the compact
organization of the GPL locus in M. smegmatis represents
the ancestral form and that evolution has scattered various pieces throughout the genome in M. abscessus and M.
chelonae, although the opposite scenario cannot be
excluded.

Methods
Bacterial strains
M. smegmatis mc2155 and M. abscessus CIP104536T
(ATCC 19977T) were cultured in 7H9 supplemented with
10% ADC at 37°C. M. chelonae CIP 104535T (ATCC
35752T) was cultured in the same medium at 30°C. All
bacterial cultures were harvested in either early exponential or late stationary phase. When required, antibiotics
were included at the following concentrations: kanamycin, 50 μg/ml, hygromycin, 200 μg/ml (for E. coli) or 50
μg/ml (for mycobacteria).
Lipid analysis
Lipids were extracted from cells with a mixture of chloroform and methanol and further partitioned by methanol
precipitation as previously described [11]. The GPLs (250
μg lipid each deposit) were identified by TLC on silica gel
Durasil 25-precoated plates (Macherey-Nagel) run in
chloroform/methanol (90:10 [vol/vol]) and using
MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis [11]. These sugarcontaining compounds were identified by spraying plates
with 0.2% anthrone in concentrated sulfuric acid, followed by heating at 110°C [7].
Computer methods
The accession number of the GPL locus of M. smegmatis is
AY439015. The sequencing and the assembly of the
genome of M. abscessus and M. chelonae was performed by
the CNS (Centre National de Séquençage-Evry-France),
[35]. Open reading frames of both M. abscessus and M.
chelonae were predicted using both SHOW [36] and
ARTEMIS [37]. The accession numbers corresponding to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/114

the regions of the GPL locus of M. abscessus are AM31616
to AM31621. The accession numbers corresponding to
the regions of the GPL locus of M. chelonae are AM231610
to AM231615. The complete sequence of M. abscessus and
M. chelonae will be reported elsewhere (J. L Risler & J. L
Gaillard, unpublished data). The 6901 putative proteins
of the genome of M. smegmatis were obtained from The
Institute for Genomic Research [38]. The comparative
genomic analysis was performed by pairwise alignments
between the proteins of the GPL locus of M. smegmatis and
each of the complete proteomes mentioned above. These
comparisons were performed using the LASSAP software
and Z-values were calculated as described [16,17]. The
identification of the orthologous links was performed
using the results of the pairwise comparisons as follows:
For each gene of the GPL locus of M. smegmatis, 5 bi-directional best hits (BBH) were identified. The BBH having
the best Z-value was selected. When several BBH exhibited
a similar Z-value (some of the genes of the GPL locus such
a fadD and fadE are affected by a high degree of paralogy),
the gene preserving the syntenic context was selected.
Identity below 25% was not considered as significant. All
the selected orthologs have a Z-value greater than 14
(except the sap gene and its orthologs).
Analysis of the M. abscessus and M. chelonae clinical
isolates using PCR
The chromosomal DNA was prepared using the beadbeater-phenol extraction method. The bacterial pellet
(corresponding to 50 ml culture) were suspended in 5 ml
of solution I (25% sucrose; 50 mM TrisCl 1 M pH = 8; 50
mM thiourea; 10 mg/ml lysozyme). The thiourea inhibits
the Tris-dependent DNAse that is present in some strains
[39]. Solution II (25% sucrose; 50 mM TrisCl pH = 8; 50
mM EDTA pH = 8) was added and the bacterial cells were
lysed as described by Howard and al. [40]. Proteinase K
was added to the lysate at 100 μg/ml and incubated overnight at 55°C. The DNA was extracted using phenol/chlorophorm/isoamyl-alcohol (25:24:1) and precipitated
with propanol. Primers (mpsF1, mpsF2, mpsR; pkF1,
pkF2, pkR) (Additional file 3) were designed according to
the chromosomal sequence of M. abscessus and M. chelonae. PCR amplification was performed using Dynazyme
Taq polymerase according to manufacturer instructions
(Finnzyme, Espoo, Finland).
Construction of acetyltransferase expression plasmids
The wild type M. smegmatis atf gene (accession number
AY138899) coding sequence was amplified by PCR using
the Pfu DNA Polymerase (Stratagene), the genomic DNA
of M. smegmatis mc2155 as template and primers containing an engineered XbaI site (atfsmeg.5 and atfsmeg.3)
(Additional file 3). After purification with the PCR purification Qiagen kit, PCR products were digested with XbaI
and cloned into the dephosphorylated expression vector

pNIP40b [41] at the unique XbaI site to generate pNIPatfsmeg. One clone having the atfsmeg gene inserted in the
opposite direction of the hygromycin resistant gene was
selected and sequenced. Using M. abscessus ATCC 19977T
genomic DNA as template, a similar strategy was applied
to clone atf1 gene and atf2 gene (AM231618) using primers atf1abs.5/atf1abs.3 and primers atf2abs.5/atf2abs.3
(Additional file 3) into pNIP40b [41] yielding
pNIPatf1absc and pNIPatf2absc, respectively. To clone the
M. abscessus atf1 and atf2 genes in frame, the af1absc PCR
product was digested by ClaI and the atf2 gene was amplified using new primers (atf2ClaI.5 and atf2abs.3) and
digested with ClaI. The 2 PCR products were digested with
XbaI, purified and ligated, with the dephosphorylated
expression vector pNIP40b at its unique XbaI site to generate pNIPatf1_2absc. These plasmids were electroporated
into M. smegmatis mc2155 atf- mutant [26] and transformants were selected on plates containing kanamycin and
hygromycin. These strains are named atf-/atfsMs, atf-/
atf1Ma, atf-/atf2Ma and atf-/atf1_2Ma.
