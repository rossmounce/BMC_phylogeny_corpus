Abstract

Background

[5]. Recently, an additional amino acid, pyrrolysine (Pyl), has
been identified, which has expanded the genetic code to 22
amino acids [6,7]. Pyl is inserted in response to a UAG codon
in several methanogenic archaea, but the specific mechanism
of insertion of this amino acid into protein is not yet known.
The mechanism of selenoprotein synthesis in prokaryotes
was elucidated extensively by Böck and colleagues [8,9].
Translation of selenoprotein mRNA requires both a

information

Selenium is a biological trace element with significant health
benefits [1]. This micronutrient is incorporated into several
proteins in bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes as selenocysteine (Sec), the 21st amino acid in proteins [2,3]. Sec is
encoded by a UGA codon in a process that requires translational recoding, as UGA is normally read as a stop codon [4].
The Sec UGA codon was the first addition to the universal
genetic code since the code was deciphered in the mid-1960s

interactions

Conclusions: This study yielded the largest selenoprotein dataset to date, doubled the number of
prokaryotic selenoprotein families and provided insights into forces that drive selenocysteine
evolution.

refereed research

Results: We identified 310 selenoprotein genes that clustered into 25 families, including 101 new
selenoprotein genes that belonged to 15 families. Most of these proteins were predicted redox
proteins containing catalytic selenocysteines. Several bacterial selenoproteins previously thought
to be restricted to eukaryotes were detected by analyzing eukaryotic and bacterial SECIS elements,
suggesting that eukaryotic and bacterial selenoprotein sets partially overlapped. The Sargasso Sea
microbial selenoproteome was rich in selenoproteins and its composition was different from that
observed in the combined set of completely sequenced genomes, suggesting that these genomes
do not accurately represent the microbial selenoproteome. Most detected selenoproteins
occurred sporadically compared to the widespread presence of their cysteine homologs, suggesting
that many selenoproteins recently evolved from cysteine-containing homologs.

deposited research

Background: Selenocysteine (Sec) is a rare amino acid which occurs in proteins in major domains
of life. It is encoded by TGA, which also serves as the signal for termination of translation,
precluding identification of selenoprotein genes by available annotation tools. Information on full
sets of selenoproteins (selenoproteomes) is essential for understanding the biology of selenium.
Herein, we characterized the selenoproteome of the largest microbial sequence dataset, the
Sargasso Sea environmental genome project.

selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) element, which is
a cis-acting stem-loop structure residing within selenoprotein
mRNAs [4,10], and trans-acting factors dedicated to Sec
incorporation [11]. In eukaryotes and archaea, SECIS elements are located in 3'-untranslated regions (3' UTRs) [12].
Bacterial SECIS elements differ from those in eukaryotes and
archaea in terms of sequence and structure and are located
immediately downstream of Sec UGA codons in the coding
regions of selenoprotein genes [13,14].
As UGA has the dual function of inserting Sec and terminating translation, and only the latter function is recognized by
available annotation programs, selenoprotein genes are
almost universally misannotated in sequence databases [15].
To address this problem, various computational approaches
to predict selenoprotein genes have been developed [16-21].
These programs successfully identified new selenoproteins in
mammalian and Drosophila genomes and in several EST
databases. However, due to lack of bacterial consensus SECIS
models, prediction of bacterial selenoproteins in genomic
sequences is difficult. Instead, these proteins can be identified through searches for Sec/Cys pairs in homologous
sequences [22].
We report here the use of a modified search strategy to characterize the selenoproteome of the largest prokaryotic
sequencing project, the 1.045 billion nucleotide whole
genome shotgun sequence of the Sargasso Sea microbial populations [23]. This database contains sequences from over
1,800 microbial species, including 148 novel bacterial phylotypes. We detected all known prokaryotic selenoproteins
present in this dataset and identified a large number of additional selenoprotein genes. This approach provided a relatively unbiased way to examine the diversity of selenoprotein
families and their evolution, and to analyze the composition
of the Sargasso Sea microbial selenoproteome as compared
with that in the combined set of completely sequenced
prokaryotic genomes.

[23]. No genes encoding Sec-containing proteins were previously identified and annotated in this dataset. To identify
selenoprotein genes in the Sargasso Sea microbial sequences,
we used an algorithm that searches for conserved Sec/Cys
pairs in homologous sequences. This approach takes advantage of the fact that almost all selenoproteins have homologs
(often in different organisms) in which Cys occupies the position of Sec. The methodology is described in Materials and
methods and is shown schematically in Figure 1. Briefly, we
searched for nucleotide sequences from the Sargasso Sea
database which, when translated, aligned with protein
sequences from the nonredundant (NR) database such that
translated TGA codons aligned with Cys and these pairs were
flanked on both sides by conserved sequences. Each TGAcontaining sequence in the Sargasso Sea database that was
identified in this manner was further screened against a set of
filters, which analyzed for possible open reading frames
(ORFs), conservation of TGA codons, conservation of Cys in
homologs, conservation of TGA-flanking regions in different
reading frames and for redundancy. Nonredundant hits were
clustered into protein families and a second BLAST search
was performed against microbial genomes and NR databases.
Finally, all groups of hits were analyzed manually and divided
into homologs of previously known selenoproteins, new
selenoproteins and selenoprotein candidates.
This procedure identified 209 selenoprotein genes, which
belonged to ten known selenoprotein families and 101 selenoprotein genes, which belonged to 15 new selenoprotein families (each represented by at least two sequences) (Table 1). In
addition, we detected 28 sequences, which showed homology
neither to known and new selenoproteins nor to each other,
and these were designated as candidate selenoproteins. Considering that several known selenoproteins were also represented by single sequences (for example, glycine reductase
selenoprotein A and glycine reductase selenoprotein B), some
of these 28 candidate selenoproteins may be true selenoproteins. However, at present, sequencing errors that generate
in-frame TGA codons cannot be excluded and therefore, no
definitive conclusions can be made regarding these
sequences. Predicted selenoproteins, particularly those
represented by a small number of sequences, require future
experimental verification.

The Sargasso Sea genomic database contains the largest collection of microbial sequences derived from a single study

Classification of selenoproteins (10 previously known and 15 new prokaryotic selenoprotein families) is supported by COG or Pfam sequence
clusters (or both) as shown in this table. The number of individual selenoprotein sequences for each family is indicated.

In total, 310 known and new selenoprotein genes and 28 candidate selenoprotein genes were detected. All these genes
were misannotated in the Sargasso Sea dataset, because the
previously used annotation tools recognized Sec-encoding
TGA codons as terminators. Consequently, some selenoprotein ORFs were annotated as truncated proteins lacking
either carboxy-terminal or amino-terminal regions containing Sec, whereas other selenoprotein ORFs were missed
altogether.

Previously known selenoprotein families detected in
the Sargasso Sea database
Our procedure detected all known prokaryotic selenoprotein
genes present in the Sargasso Sea database, which could also

be independently identified by homology searches using
known selenoprotein sequences as queries. Eight of the ten
known selenoprotein families detected in the dataset were
represented by 5-48 selenoprotein genes, whereas two families, glycine reductase selenoprotein A (grdA) and glycine
reductase selenoprotein B (grdB), were represented by single
sequences. Interestingly, although all known selenoproteins
present in the dataset were identified, only nine of the ten
families had Cys homologs in the NR database. One
selenoprotein, grdA, did not have known Cys homologs [22].
Nevertheless, grdA was also identified because of annotation
errors, as Sec in this protein was annotated as Cys in some NR
database entries.

Figure sequence alignments
Multiple2 (see previous page) of new selenoproteins and their Cys homologs
Multiple sequence alignments of new selenoproteins and their Cys homologs. The alignments show Sec-flanking regions in detected proteins. Both
selenoprotein sequences detected in the Sargasso Sea database and their Cys-containing homologs present in indicated organisms are shown. Conserved
residues are highlighted. Predicted Sec (U) and the corresponding Cys (C) residues in other homologs are shown in red and blue background, respectively.
Sequence alignments were generated with ClustalW and shaded by BoxShade v3.21.

Several selenoprotein families had a particularly high representation in the Sargasso Sea dataset. The most abundant
family was SelW-like, which contained 48 genes. Although
the function of this protein is unclear, a conserved CXXU
motif (Cys separated from Sec by two other residues) suggests
a redox function. In addition, this protein was previously
found to interact with glutathione, a major redox thiol compound in cells [24,25]. A peroxiredoxin (Prx) family had 43
genes and was the second most abundant selenoprotein family. Peroxiredoxins protect bacterial and eukaryotic cells
against oxidative injury [26]. Proline reductase (prdB, 42
genes) and selenophosphate synthetase (28 genes) were the
third and fourth most abundant families. The former is
involved in amino-acid metabolism and catalyzes the reductive ring cleavage of D-proline to 5-aminovalerate [27]. The
latter is a key component in prokaryotic selenoprotein biosynthesis [2,28]. A Prx-like protein family was represented by
22 selenoprotein sequences. It had distant homology to the
Prx family, but its predicted active site contained a thioredoxin-like UXXC motif instead of the TXXU motif present in
Sec-containing Prx. These five families accounted for 87.6%
of known selenoprotein sequences, suggesting importance of
their functions in the Sargasso Sea environment. Other
detected selenoprotein families included thioredoxin (Trx),
formate dehydrogenase alpha chain (fdhA), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), grdA and grdB.

New selenoprotein families identified in the Sargasso
Sea database
Among 15 new selenoprotein families, 13 contained at least
two individual TGA-containing ORFs (Table 1). Although two
selenoprotein families, DsbG-like and NADH:ubiquinone
oxidoreductase, were represented by single entries, we placed
them in the new selenoprotein category because they had
been previously reported as candidate selenoproteins [22]. Of
the 15 families, 14 either contained a domain of known function or were homologous to protein families with known functions, including several which were represented by multiple
sequences: AhpD-like protein (27 sequences), arsenate
reductase (14 sequences), molybdopterin biosynthesis MoeB
protein (11 sequences), glutaredoxin (Grx) (ten sequences)
and DsbA-like protein (nine sequences). Thus, these findings
implicated selenium in arsenate reduction, molybdopterin
biosynthesis, disulfide bond formation and other redoxbased processes. No functional evidence could be obtained for
one family, which was designated as hypothetical protein 1
(represented by four sequences). However, a conserved
CXXU motif was present in hypothetical protein 1, suggesting
a possible redox function. Multiple alignments of several new

selenoproteins and their Cys-containing homologs (Figure 2)
highlight sequence conservation of Sec/Cys pairs and their
flanking regions.
All new selenoproteins contained stable stem-loop structures
downstream of Sec-encoding TGA codons that resembled
bacterial SECIS elements. Representative predicted SECIS
elements found in several new selenoprotein families are
shown in Figure 3. A structural alignment of putative SECIS
elements in known and new selenoprotein genes in the Sargasso Sea database (Figure 4) showed that they shared the
common features of bacterial SECIS elements (for example, a
small apical loop containing a guanosine, see Materials and
methods).

Significant overlap between eukaryotic and
prokaryotic selenoproteomes
Among 25 known and new bacterial selenoprotein families
identified in the Sargasso Sea dataset, three families, SelWlike, GPx and deiodinase, were previously thought to be of
eukaryotic origin. However, multiple sequence alignments
(Figure 5) and phylogenetic analyses (Figure 6) strongly suggested a bacterial origin of these selenoproteins. Although
several eukaryotic sequences in the Sargasso Sea dataset were
also detected (for example, GPx homolog, accession number
AACY01485942), all SelW and deiodinase sequences and
most GPx sequences were bacterial selenoproteins. We based
this conclusion on the presence of bacterial and absence of
eukaryotic and archaeal SECIS elements in these sequences.
In addition, phylogenetic analyses of coding sequences that
flanked selenoprotein genes indicated that these contigs were
derived from bacteria (data not shown). As information about
the species present in the environmental samples is not available, analysis of SECIS elements provides a means of distinguishing selenoprotein sequences in the major domains of
life, as SECIS elements are different in eukaryotes, bacteria
and archaea in regard to sequence and structure [29]. Representative bacterial SECIS elements of the three bacterial
selenoproteins and their eukaryotic counterparts are shown
in Figure 7.
Deiodinase is known to activate or inactivate thyroid hormones via the reaction of reductive deiodination [30]. This
protein has previously been described only in animals and
only in the selenoprotein form. However, we identified both
Cys-containing and Sec-containing homologs of deiodinase in
the Sargasso Sea dataset (Figure 5). Bacterial deiodinase-like
proteins likely serve a different function than animal deiodinases as thyroid hormones are not expected to occur in these

Alignment of SECIS elements present in Sargasso Sea selenoproteins
Alignment of SECIS elements present in Sargasso Sea selenoproteins. The Sargasso Sea dataset includes 10 known selenoprotein families and 15 new
families. SECIS elements in representative members of these families were manually aligned on the basis of primary sequence and secondary structure
features.

organisms. Deiodinases possess a variation of the thioredoxin
fold [31], which is known for redox functions. It is possible
that bacterial deiodinase-like proteins also serve a redox
function.
SelW and GPx homologs were recently detected in some bacteria, but the number of these sequences was small and their
origin not clear [22]. Detection of a large number of SelW and
GPx selenoprotein sequences in the Sargasso Sea allowed us
to perform phylogenetic analyses (Figure 6), which suggested
that at least some members of these families evolved independently in bacteria and eukaryotes.
In addition, we identified five eukaryotic selenoproteins:
SelM, SelT, SelU, GPx and methionine-S-sulfoxide reductase
(MsrA). Except for GPx, these families were represented by
single selenoprotein genes. No bacterial SECIS elements were
found in these genes. In SelM and SelT sequences, typical
eukaryotic SECIS elements were present in 3' UTRs as
detected by SECISearch [16], whereas GPx, MsrA and SelU
sequences did not extend enough to test for presence of
SECIS elements in 3' UTRs. However, the MsrA and GPx
sequences were most similar to plant proteins, suggesting
that the two proteins also were of eukaryotic origin. In addi-

tion, eukaryotic GPx sequences could be distinguished by the
presence of introns.
Previous analyses of selenoprotein sets in the three domains
of life revealed that bacterial and archaeal selenoproteomes
significantly overlap, whereas eukaryotes had a different set
of selenoproteins [15,20]. The only exception was selenophosphate synthetase, but as it is involved in Sec biosynthesis, this protein must be maintained in organisms that utilize
Sec. However, our finding of additional selenoproteins in Sargasso Sea organisms revealed a significant overlap between
prokaryotic and eukaryotic selenoproteomes.

Differences in selenoprotein sets in the Sargasso Sea
database and completely sequenced prokaryotic
genomes
An exhaustive search of Sargasso Sea selenoproteins against
260 completely sequenced prokaryotic genomes revealed that
these selenoproteins were present in a limited number of
genomes, which contrasted with the widespread occurrence
of their Cys-containing homologs (Table 2). Although the size
of the Sargasso Sea dataset and the combined set of 260
prokaryotic genomes were similar, the two datasets differed
in regard to both number and distribution of selenoprotein
genes present in these databases. The Sargasso Sea dataset

was three times richer in selenoproteins than the prokaryotic
genomes, suggesting that the environment of the Sargasso
Sea generally favors evolution and maintenance of selenoproteins. Presumably, the Sargasso Sea organisms take advantage of a relatively constant supply of selenium in sea water
and have increased their demand for this trace element,
whereas the dependence of the organisms with completely
sequenced genomes on selenium is mixed as selenium may be
a limiting factor in some environments. Six previously known
selenoproteins were not detected in the Sargasso Sea database (Table 2). This is likely because these selenoproteins primarily occur in archaea. Archaea accounted only for a small
fraction of the Sargasso Sea organisms [23].
In addition, the abundance of particular selenoprotein genes
in the Sargasso Sea dataset and in the 260 microbial genomes
was quite different. Particularly surprising was the small
number of formate dehydrogenase genes in the Sargasso Sea
database [32]. Previous analyses of completely sequenced
prokaryotic genomes found that this protein was present in
essentially all organisms that utilized Sec, and its occurrence
was by far more common than any other selenoprotein [22].
However, in the Sargasso Sea environment, the utilization of
this protein was limited. This might be related to the aerobic
nature of microbial species that reside near the surface of the
Sargasso Sea (where the environmental samples were collected for sequencing).
We also observed that in the previously analyzed prokaryotic
genomes, more than half of selenoproteins were metal-binding proteins, in which Sec coordinated molybdenum,
tungsten or nickel [22]. In contrast, the Sargasso Sea selenoproteins were primarily thiol-dependent peroxidases and oxidoreductases; metal-coordinating selenoproteins were
represented exclusively by formate dehydrogenase and
accounted for less than 4% of all detected selenoproteins.
These data suggested that the previously characterized
genomes did not represent the general composition of
prokaryotic selenoproteomes.
Although the two sets of selenoproteins (Sargasso Sea and the
completely sequenced prokaryotic genomes) were different,
the majority of detected selenoproteins showed scattered
occurrence. Indeed, the Sec-containing forms of proteins
were rare compared to homologous Cys-containing forms,
which were widespread. It appears that that most detected
selenoproteins evolved recently from Cys-containing
homologs in organisms, which already had the system for Sec
insertion. It can be predicted that as searches of additional
prokaryotic sequence datasets identify new selenoprotein

genes, many of these will be present in only a small number of
species. At present, Sec evolution is not fully understood, but
it is clear that Sec/Cys interchanges are possible in both directions depending on the need for particular redox properties
and on the restriction imposed by the dependence of species
on the trace element selenium.

Most selenoprotein families serve redox functions
Further analysis of both Sargasso Sea and completely
sequenced prokaryotic genomes revealed that essentially all
selenoproteins with known function were redox proteins,
which used Sec either to coordinate redox-active metals or for
thiol/disulfide-like redox catalysis. Among 25 selenoprotein
families detected in the Sargasso Sea, 14 (194 selenoprotein
sequences, 62.6%) were homologs of known thiol-dependent
redox proteins (Table 3), and most other proteins were
candidate redox proteins. Many of the Sargasso Sea selenoproteins contained a UXXC redox motif. The analogous
CXXC motif is present in a variety of thiol-dependent redox
enzymes [33-35], but it is also common in metal-binding proteins. The catalytic activity of UXXC-containing selenoenzymes is expected to be higher than that of its Cys-containing
homologs [2,36]. In addition, several selenoproteins had
other candidate redox motifs [34], such as UXXS (arsenate
reductase), TXXU (peroxiredoxin and NADH:ubiquinone
oxidoreductase), UXXT (glutathione peroxidase) and CXXU
(AhpD-like protein [37], SelW-like protein, CMD domaincontaining protein and hypothetical protein 1).

Discussion

Whole-genome shotgun sequencing projects have been
applied extensively to determine genomic sequences of a
variety of organisms, and recently this approach was used to
sequence the microbial community of the Sargasso Sea. Many
of the Sargasso Sea organisms represent phyletic groups previously not known or poorly characterized, including organisms that could not be isolated from the microbial community
or be cultured [23]. Identification of selenoprotein genes in
such a large prokaryotic dataset may help understand the role
of selenium in this microbial community and by analogy in
other organisms, including humans.
Previous functional information on selenoproteins has been
derived largely from wet-lab experiments. More recently, several in silico approaches that identify full sets of
selenoproteins in organisms provided powerful new tools for
determining identities of selenoproteins as well as their
expression characteristics and functions [16-20,38]. Most of
these methods were based on searches for SECIS elements. As

Phylogenetic analyses of deiodinase, GPx and SelW protein families
Phylogenetic analyses of deiodinase, GPx and SelW protein families. Selenoproteins are shown in red and Cys-containing homologs in green. The
phylogenetic trees were generated by ClustalW and represented by Treeme.

Sec is typically located at enzyme active centers, and most
selenoproteins had homologs in which Cys replaced Sec, a
SECIS-independent strategy was also developed that allowed
searches for Sec/Cys pairs in homologous sequences [21,22].
In the present study, we used a similar procedure, but supplemented it with additional filters to improve performance. All
known prokaryotic selenoprotein families present in the Sargasso Sea genomic dataset were identified by this approach
(209 genes that clustered into ten prokaryotic selenoprotein
families). In addition, 101 sequences that belonged to 15 new
selenoprotein families were identified. Thus, our study has
approximately doubled the list of known prokaryotic selenoprotein families and generated the largest selenoprotein dataset to date.
On the basis of the presence of SECIS elements specific to
major domains of life, we could determine the origin of
detected selenoproteins (that is, bacterial, archaeal or eukaryotic). All ten known and 15 new prokaryotic selenoprotein
families had predicted bacterial SECIS elements. Interestingly, both selenoprotein forms and Cys-containing
homologs of thyroid hormone deiodinase, a protein previously thought to be restricted to the animal kingdom and
present exclusively in the selenoprotein form, were identified
in prokaryotes. The detected deiodinase-like proteins were
prokaryotic as they contained bacterial SECIS elements.
Detection of prokaryotic deiodinase-like proteins and several
other bacterial selenoproteins thought to be restricted to
eukaryotes suggests a revision of the view that eukaryotic and
prokaryotic selenoproteomes do not overlap. Although this
idea was consistent with the previous selenoprotein analyses,
at least four selenoprotein families are now known that occur
in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes: SelW, GPx,
selenophosphate synthetase and deiodinase. We also
detected homologs of five additional eukaryotic selenoproteins, but the absence of bacterial SECIS elements, presence
of eukaryotic SECIS elements or introns, and homology to
eukaryotic proteins argued that these selenoproteins were
eukaryotic in origin.
Surprisingly, sets of selenoproteins in the Sargasso Sea database and in the combined set of 260 completely sequenced
prokaryotic genomes were quite different in regard to both
identities and number of selenoprotein genes. The Sargasso
Sea dataset was rich in selenoprotein genes, most of which
were homologs of known thiol-dependent redox enzymes. In
contrast, the proportion of selenoprotein genes in completely

sequenced prokaryotic genomes was approximately three
times lower, and the majority of detected genes used Sec for
metal coordination. Thus, even with the availability of 260
genomes, the roles of selenium in nature are just beginning to
be understood. For example, our current analysis of the Sargasso Sea dataset implicated selenium in arsenate reduction,
molybdopterin biosynthesis, sulfurtransferase function and
other processes, which were not known to be dependent on
this trace element.
We also observed common features in the two sets of selenoproteins. For example, most of the detected selenoproteins
had a large number of Cys homologs. The scattered occurrence of selenoproteins in both datasets suggests a highly
dynamic nature of Sec evolution. As long as the system for Sec
insertion is maintained, Sec may appear when required by the
changing environment and disappear when this requirement
recedes. Thus, the analysis of selenoproteomes and the compensatory sets of Cys-containing proteins provides a unique
model system to examine evolutionary forces to a changing
environment.

Materials and methods
Sequence databases and resources
The whole-genome shotgun sequence database of the Sargasso Sea was obtained from the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) ftp server with the project
accession
number
AACY00000000
[39].
Unlike
conventional sequence entries, only the unassembled singletons and individual singletons were deposited in order to
accurately reflect the diversity in the sample and to allow
searches across the entire sample within a single database.
The Sargasso Sea database contained 811,372 genomic
sequences, which corresponded to a total of 1.045 billion
nucleotides.
The NR protein database was downloaded from the NCBI ftp
server [40]. This dataset contained 1,990,024 protein
sequences (667,623,348 amino acids). Blast programs [41]
were also obtained from the NCBI ftp server [42]. We used the
2.2.9 version of this program.
To enable selenoprotein searches automatically, we developed a set of programs as discussed below. A UNIX/LINUX
platform was used. The entire search process was performed
on a Prairiefire 128-node, 256-processor Beowulf cluster
supercomputer at the Research Computing Facility of the
University of Nebraska - Lincoln.

information

Each Cys-containing sequence in the NR protein database
was searched against the Sargasso Sea database of nucleotide
sequences for possible TGA-containing hits using TBLASTN.
E-value cutoff was set to 10.0. TBLASTN output for each pro-

tein sequence was parsed and Cys/TAA or Cys/TAG pairs
were filtered out. Only local alignments, in which Cys in a
query sequence was aligned with TGA in the nucleotide
sequence from the target Sargasso Sea database, were further
analyzed. As Sec is typically located in enzyme active sites,
additional filters were added. Specifically, local alignments

were discarded if they contained more than two stop codons
(including TGA, TAA and TAG), two stop codons of which one
was not TGA, or two TGA codons with one aligned to a nonCys residue. A total of 38,446 local redundant alignments
(also designated as Cys/TGA pairs) were identified which corresponded to 19,410 proteins in the NR protein database.

Analyses of ORFs, conservation of TGA-flanking
regions and redundancy
For each TGA-containing sequence in the local alignment set,
regions upstream and downstream of the TGA were analyzed
to identify minimal ORFs with the assumption that in-frame
TGA coding for Sec must be inside predicted ORFs. If stop
codons were encountered closer to TGA codons than candidate start codons (ATG or GTG), such TGA-containing
sequences were discarded. Conservation of TGA-flanking
regions in all 6 reading frames was also analyzed with
BLASTX and screened against a database of conserved
domains using RPS-BLAST. These criteria were also used to
filter out false positive hits. Finally, redundant sequences
were removed. These filters reduced the set to 2,131 unique
TGA-containing candidate ORFs.

Clustering of TGA-containing sequences
To cluster protein sequences into different protein families or
groups, the pairwise alignment tool in the BLAST program
package, BL2SEQ, was used. 1,045 clusters were obtained
with 1 to 63 sequences in each cluster.

http://genomebiology.com/2005/6/4/R37

candidates. Except for known selenoproteins, clusters containing at least two different sequences with conserved inframe TGA codons were considered as new selenoproteins.
Clusters containing only one sequence were considered
selenoprotein candidates because of the possibility of a
sequencing error causing an in-frame TGA. Finally, clusters
that could be aligned such that their TGAs also aligned, were
joined into larger clusters.

and in-frame TGA location) is available as a text file (Additional data file 1) with the online version of this paper and at

Cysteine conservation and selenoprotein classification
Considering that Cys/TGA pairs in most false-positive hits
were not expected to be conserved, whereas conservation was
expected for true-positive Cys/Sec pairs, all clusters were
automatically searched against NCBI NR and microbial databases using BLASTX and TBLASTX. Each predicted ORF
containing an in-frame TGA was considered further only if at
least two corresponding Cys-containing homologs were
detected and the proportion of TGA/Cys pairs in the set of
homologs was greater than 50%. This procedure resulted in
331 clusters containing 1,072 ORFs.

All 331 clusters were analyzed for the presence of potential
bacterial SECIS elements immediately downstream of the
TGA codons using mfold [43] or RNAfold [44] programs. In
addition, candidate SECIS structures were screened against a
bacterial SECIS consensus model [45]. The presence of
archaeal or eukaryotic SECIS elements was tested using
SECISearch [20,22]. The occurrence of SECIS elements specific for each domain of life was one criterion to determine
protein origin. Phylogenetic analyses and the occurrence of
introns were also used as criteria for designating proteins as
bacterial, archaeal or eukaryotic.
A simple classifier was developed to divide clusters that contained bacterial SECIS-like structures into three groups:
known selenoproteins, new selenoproteins and selenoprotein
