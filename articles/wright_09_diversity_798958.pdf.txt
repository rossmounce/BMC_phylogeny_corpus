Abstract
Background: The study of venomous fishes is in a state of relative infancy when compared to that
of other groups of venomous organisms. Catfishes (Order Siluriformes) are a diverse group of bony
fishes that have long been known to include venomous taxa, but the extent and phylogenetic
distribution of this venomous species diversity has never been documented, while the nature of the
venoms themselves also remains poorly understood. In this study, I used histological preparations
from over 100 catfish genera, basic biochemical and toxicological analyses of fin spine extracts from
several species, and previous systematic studies of catfishes to examine the distribution of venom
glands in this group. These results also offer preliminary insights into the evolutionary history of
venom glands in the Siluriformes.
Results: Histological examinations of 158 catfish species indicate that approximately 1250-1625+
catfish species should be presumed to be venomous, when viewed in conjunction with several
hypotheses of siluriform phylogeny. Maximum parsimony character optimization analyses indicate
two to three independent derivations of venom glands within the Siluriformes. A number of
putative toxic peptides were identified in the venoms of catfish species from many of the families
determined to contain venomous representatives. These peptides elicit a wide array of
physiological effects in other fishes, though any one species examined produced no more than
three distinct putative toxins in its venom. The molecular weights and effects produced by these
putative toxic peptides show strong similarities to previously characterized toxins found in catfish
epidermal secretions.
Conclusion: Venom glands have evolved multiple times in catfishes (Order Siluriformes), and
venomous catfishes may outnumber the combined diversity of all other venomous vertebrates. The
toxic peptides found in catfish venoms may be derived from epidermal secretions that have been
demonstrated to accelerate the healing of wounds, rather than defensive crinotoxins.

Background
The venoms produced by cnidarians, mollusks, snakes,
arachnids, insects, and some mammals have been the subject of multiple studies of chemical structure [1-3], pharmacology [2-5], and toxicology [5-7], in addition to
several evolutionary studies [8-12], but information

regarding these aspects of fish venoms is relatively sparse
[13-18]. Until recently, even reliable estimates of the
number of venomous fish species have been unavailable.
Morphological examinations, combined with phylogenetic analyses have suggested that 585-650 species of
spiny-rayed fishes are venomous, a number which rivals

the known diversity of venomous snakes and is significantly higher than previous estimates of about 200 venomous spiny-rayed fish species [18]. We still lack
estimates, however, for catfishes (Order Siluriformes), a
diverse, monophyletic group with 34 recognized extant
families and over 400 genera containing more than 3,000
known species [19]. The historical lack of such basic information may be largely responsible for the paucity of
research on venomous fishes in general, and venomous
catfishes in particular.
The venom glands of catfishes are found in association
with sharp, bony spines along the leading edge of the dorsal and pectoral fins, which can be locked into place when
the catfish is threatened (Fig. 1). When a spine enters a
potential predator, the integument surrounding the
venom gland cells is torn, releasing venom into the
wound. Catfish venoms have been shown to display neurotoxic and hemolytic properties and can produce a variety of additional effects such as severe pain, ischemia,

muscle spasm, and respiratory distress; though any single
species' venom may not display all of these properties
[20]. These effects are produced in a wide range of taxonomic classes of vertebrates, including mammals, reptiles,
birds, and amphibians [21]. In humans, the primary
symptoms are severe pain and swelling at the site of
envenomation, though fatalities have been reported in
cases involving Plotosus lineatus (Plotosidae) and Heteropneustes fossilis (Clariidae) [20]. Complications arising
from secondary infection of the wound are also frequently
encountered.
The chemical nature of piscine venoms is poorly known,
though the loss of toxicity seen when these venoms are
subjected to common denaturing agents suggests that proteins constitute the major toxic component of these secretions [16]. Thus far, detailed examinations of these
proteins in catfishes have been limited to the venoms of
Plotosus canius, a particularly toxic marine species found in
Southeast Asia, and Ameiurus catus, a freshwater species
found in the eastern United States. The neurotoxic and
hemolytic properties of P. canius venom have been attributed solely to a 15 kDa protein, termed toxin-PC [22]. The
venom of A. catus was thought to contain anywhere from
two to eight toxic proteins with approximate molecular
weights of 10 kDa [23]. Both the mechanism by which
these toxins act and their physiological targets are very
poorly understood. It is thought that cytolytic activity due
to pore formation in cell membranes is a likely explanation, as this activity is present in other 'pain-producing'
venoms, such as those produced by bees [24] and platypus [25], and reactions consistent with this mechanism
have been observed in response to piscine venoms [16].
As a globally distributed and thus, biogeographically
interesting group, catfishes have recently been a topic of
interest in several phylogenetic studies [26-29]. When
combined with these data, information regarding the distribution of venom glands within the Siluriformes can be
examined in an evolutionary context, and we can begin to
build a foundation to advance the studies of venom evolution in this group to the level seen in other venomous
organisms. In this work, I use histological and toxicological techniques to elucidate the diversity and taxonomic
distribution of venomous catfishes and examine these
findings within the phylogenetic framework established
by previous authors to provide a broad-scale hypothesis
for the evolutionary origins of venom glands in catfishes.
These examinations are further integrated with preliminary biochemical characterizations of venoms from several catfish species to highlight an intriguing, novel
hypothesis for the evolutionary development of venom
glands in catfishes.

Results
To establish a preliminary estimate of the number and
phylogenetic distribution of venomous catfish species,
159 species from over 100 genera, representing 32 of the
34 siluriform families were examined for the presence of
venom glands (Additional file 1). Material for representatives of the families Austroglanididae and Lacantuniidae
was unavailable for study, but their omission from this
study has little effect on estimates of the number of venomous catfish species, due to the low species diversity of
these families (three species and one species, respectively). Structures identified as venom glands were
observed in 20 families. Venom gland size, orientation,
and cellular morphology were found to vary considerably
between, and sometimes within, families (Additional file
1; Figs. 2, 3). Based upon the generic identity of the venomous species identified, the number of species contained within those genera, and the number of remaining
unexamined species in those families shown to contain
venomous representatives (See Methods for detailed

explanation), an estimate of 1234-1625 venomous catfish
species was developed (Table 1).
The production of toxic compounds by representatives
from several siluriform families was confirmed through
analysis of effects of crude fin-spine extracts on a predatory fish species. The injection of fin-spine extracts caused
symptoms of envenomation in all cases; in all cases but
one (Plotosus lineatus), injection with control extracts prepared from fin tissue yielded no appreciable effect. Symptoms produced by the venoms tested included
chromatophore expansion at the injection site, loss of coloration elsewhere on the body, hemorrhage, loss of equilibrium, muscle spasm, and in one instance (Plotosus
lineatus), rapid mortality (Table 2). Symptoms of envenomation occurred immediately and were resolved within
an hour in most trials. Though representatives from several families were not examined, species in those families
possess cells associated with their fin spines that have sim-

ilar, if not identical, morphologies to the venomous species tested, suggesting that these cells produce toxic
substances in the untested families as well.
The evolution of venom glands within the order Siluriformes was examined by performing maximum parsimony character optimization analyses on several
previously published siluriform phylogenies that were
reconstructed from both morphological [26,30] and
molecular [28] data. Multiple phylogenies were analyzed
due to the fact that the relationships of some siluriform
families are either poorly resolved or vary between
reported phylogenies. Given the widespread presence of
venom glands in catfishes, it was expected that these pre-

vious systematic studies, in conjunction with the results
presented above, would offer some insight into broader
phylogenetic patterns of siluriform venom gland evolution in spite of the poor resolution of familial relationships found in these phylogenies.
Character optimization anlyses of these phylogenies indicate that this trait has arisen at least twice (Figs. 4, 5) and
potentially three or more times (Fig. 6). Venom glands
evolved once within the Loricarioidei, a diverse and exclusively Neotropical suborder of armored catfishes, in the
family Callichthyidae. They also appear independently at
least once basally within the Siluroidei, a clade containing
all other non-loricarioid catfishes with the exception of

on nuclear gene sequences (RAG1 and RAG2) implies an
additional evolution of venom glands within the Doradidae, owing to their placement within a clade of South
American catfishes including the Aspredinidae and
Auchenipteridae (members of which appear to lack
venom glands) [[28]; Fig. 6].

family Callichthyidae. Patterns of venom gland evolution in
the Siluroidei are obscured, due to the poor resolution of
basal relationships. Given the broad range of siluroid families

composition between these families, a single, relatively basal
development of venom glands seems the most parsimonious
and likely scenario.

(and families), potentially reflecting homology of these
proteins. Comparisons with extracts prepared from caudal-fin tissue were used to identify putative toxin peptides.
The composition of different species' venoms was found
to vary considerably, but some strong similarities were
also evident. A putative toxin peptide of approximately

110 kDa was found in very high concentrations in the
venom extracts of eight of the nine species examined (Fig.
7). Although a protein with a similar molecular weight
was also found in the caudal-fin extracts of several species,
it was generally found in much lower concentrations, and
previous authors have stated that at least some toxin producing cells may be present in the fin tissue of catfishes
[13]. In addition to the siluroid species tested, a 110 kDa
peptide also appears to be present in the venom extracts
of several species of Corydoras. Corydoras is distantly
related to the remaining species analyzed, and the possession of venom glands by members of the family Callichthyidae appears to represent an independent evolution of
these structures. A protein having this molecular weight
was not found in the fin-spine extracts of Pimelodus pictus,
a species shown by the current study to be venomous,
reflecting a secondary loss of this putative toxic peptide.
Additionally, nearly every siluroid species examined displayed at least one (and often more) putative toxic peptide(s) of approximately 10-20 kDa in weight. These
peptides appear to vary significantly within this range
however, and no molecular weight was represented with
the same frequency as the 110 kDa peptide described
above.

2 nuclear data. Red branches indicate venomous lineages,

independent evolution of venom glands is found in the Loricarioidei, in the family Callichthyidae. Independent evolution
of venom glands must also be ascribed to the family Doradidae, due to its nesting within a clade containing the non-venomous Aspredinidae and Auchenipteridae. Similarly to Fig. 5,
the evolution of venom glands at the base of the Siluroidei
are obscured, due to poor resolution of basal relationships.

Venomous Catfish Diversity
Examinations of histological sections of pectoral-fin
spines, in conjunction with character optimization analyses of previously published siluriform phylogenies and
toxicological assays, imply that approximately 1250-1625
species of catfishes from at least 20 families are venomous. These numbers are much higher than previous estimates, based largely on anecdotal evidence, which
suggested a maximum of 1000+ venomous catfish species
[18]. Of these families, 14 (Akysidae, Anchariidae, Callichthyidae, Chacidae, Claroteidae, Cranoglanididae, Doradidae,
Heptapteridae,
Mochokidae,
Pangasiidae,
Pimelodidae, Pseudopimelodidae, Schilbidae, Siluridae)
are shown to contain venomous taxa for the first time; six
(Amblycipitidae, Ariidae, Bagridae, Clariidae, Ictaluridae,
Plotosidae) have previously been demonstrated to contain venomous representatives [20]. The approximation
of 1250 species of venomous catfishes is undoubtedly an
underestimate, as many genera in siluriform families containing venomous taxa remain to be examined. New species of catfishes are also continuously being discovered
and described (958 species described in the last 10 years
according to the Catalog of Fishes [31]), with some venomous genera such as Chiloglanis (Mochokidae) containing an estimated 25 or more undescribed species [J.P.
Friel, pers. comm.].

The apparently low incidence of independent venom
gland evolution in catfishes stands in stark contrast to the

clearly visible. Samples from non-venomous Ameiurus melas are shown for comparison.

results obtained for venomous spiny-rayed fishes, in
which venom glands appear to have evolved independently no fewer than nine times [18]. The exact number of
times that venom glands arose within the Siluroidei
remains ambiguous, though the majority of possible
resolved topologies would require only a single derivation. However, the hypothesis of an additional derivation
of venom glands in the family Doradidae that would be
necessitated by the results of recent molecular phylogenetic analyses [28,29] does warrant further investigation.
The venom glands found in doradid species differ morphologically from those seen in other siluroid families, by
virtue of their structure (discrete clusters of glandular tissue internally subdivided into pockets of glandular cells
by integumentary septa vs. continuous single sheaths of
glandular cells) (Figs. 2 and 3), orientation (limited to
spaces between posterior serrae of dorsal and pectoral-fin
spines vs. being found along the entire length of the
spines) (Fig. 8), and visibility without magnification (Fig.
8). Future studies of doradid venom composition should
help to clarify this issue.
The loss of venom glands appears to be a common phenomenon within catfishes, which is not surprising given
that bony fin spines have been lost in some families
(Malapteruridae, most amphiliids). Genera in several
families that contain venomous representatives (Heptapteridae, Pimelodidae, Siluridae) have also lost bony
dorsal and/or pectoral-fin spines. Without an effective
delivery system, there would seem to be no selection pressure for the maintenance of venom producing structures,

leading to their reduction and eventual loss. The apparent
loss of venom glands in groups that have maintained
bony fin spines [Aspredinidae, Auchenipteridae, Sisoridae, some ictalurids (see Additional file 1)] is more unexpected, and explanations for these losses are not
immediately apparent.
Inter- and intrageneric loss of venom glands was also
found within the family Ictaluridae (Additional file 1).
Both Ameiurus melas and Pylodictus olivaris lack any structures that could be identified as venom glands based on
histological examination. Additionally, SDS-PAGE analysis detected no putative venom peptides in either species
(Fig. 7). This finding was particularly surprising for A.
melas, which had previously been considered venomous
and quite virulent, based upon toxicological and histological work [13,20]. This discrepancy may be attributable to
geographic variation in venom production; A. melas is a
widely distributed species and the specimens examined in
the current study were collected in Michigan, while those
used in the previous toxicological study came from Texas.
A potentially important factor in the case of Pylodictus is
that this species can reach adult sizes that would presumably prohibit predation by even the largest North American predatory fishes (all of which are gape-limited
predators), possibly weakening or eliminating selection
for the maintenance of venom glands through adulthood.
The number of venomous catfishes estimated by this
study (when combined with estimates of venomous
spiny-rayed and cartilaginous fishes) supports previous
claims that venomous fishes far outnumber all other venomous vertebrates [18], and also demonstrates that venomous catfish diversity likely equals or exceeds that of all
other venomous vertebrates (including other fishes) combined (Table 3). Recently, some lizards and snakes traditionally considered to be non-venomous have been
shown to produce several of the same toxic compounds as
their venomous relatives [32]. Many of these species
appear to lack a specialized mechanism for transmitting
these compounds, possibly preventing them from being
classified as venomous in the traditional sense [33], due
to a potential inability to effectively utilize these compounds in feeding. However, recent work has shown that
venom is likely to play a previously unsuspected, but
major role in the feeding ecology of Varanus komodoensis
(Komodo Dragon) [34]. This finding strongly indicates
that such a role will be found for venom in other groups
of lizards as well, potentially vastly increasing the estimate
of venomous reptile diversity.
Evolution of Catfish Venoms
Cameron and Endean [35] hypothesized that the venom
glands of fishes are derived from glandular epidermal cells
that secrete toxic proteinaceous compounds (termed "ich-

thyocrinotoxins") when fishes are threatened or injured.
While it is true that these compounds are secreted in these
situations, the hypothesis that they serve in an antipredatory capacity in catfishes appears flawed. With the exception of ichthyocrinotoxins associated with the epidermis
of the dorsal and pectoral fin, there is no effective delivery
device for these compounds, which are produced all over
the body. This is of particular importance, as all assays
demonstrating toxicity of epidermal secretions of catfishes
have relied on intravenous injection of these compounds
as a toxicological assay [36-40]. Furthermore, the presence
of epidermal secretions does not appear to be a significant
deterrent to potential predators, as they will attack and
feed on distressed catfishes, as well as other baits coated
with catfish epidermal secretions [[41]; pers. obs.].
That venom glands in catfishes produce similar compounds to epidermal glandular cells has been indicated by
immunocytochemical assays [39]. The results of SDSPAGE analyses presented here offer additional support for
the similarity of these secretions. The major toxic factor of
the skin secretion of Arius bilineatus has been isolated and
shown to have a molecular weight of approximately 39
kDa [40]. The venom of Arius jordani clearly shows a
strong band at approximately 39 kDa which is found in
low concentration in the control lane (Fig. 7). The presence of this protein in the control sample is likely due to
the presence of epidermal secretory cells in the tissue sample used, while the low concentration is due to the
removal of most of the epidermal secretions before sample preparation. While these cells were also probably
present in spine samples, the large difference in concentration indicates that venom gland cells are likely responsible for production of most of this protein band. A
similar case is seen in the electrophoretic profile of Plotosus lineatus, which shows major toxin bands at 15-16 kDa
and 13-14 kDa (Fig. 7). While the larger band is similar in
weight to toxin-PC, as characterized by Auddy and Gomes
[22], the lower band is very similar in weight to a toxic
fraction isolated from the skin secretions of this species
[37,38], with the slight discrepancy in estimated size possibly being due to differences in sample preparation and
analysis.

While the venom gland cells in catfishes (and other fishes
as well) are likely to be derived from epidermal secretory
cells, an alternative scenario to Cameron and Endean's
antipredatory hypothesis is also able to explain their origin. Studies of the epidermal secretions of several Arius
species have indicated that these compounds are able to
accelerate healing of wounds and may also have some
antimicrobial properties [41-43]. The spines of catfishes
act to effectively increase their cross-sectional circumference when locked into place, and would likely be the first
structures to contact a gape-limited predator's tissues during an attack. As such, the spines would often be damaged, and individuals with larger numbers of epidermal
secretory cells surrounding the spine could gain a selective
advantage due to decreased healing time and a corresponding decreased chance of infection of exposed tissues. This selection may have led to increased
aggregations of these cells around the fin spines, with the
toxic effects of their secretions being an epiphenomenon
to their primary healing benefits. Once the toxic secretions had become associated with an effective delivery
device, selection for increased toxicity, as seen in some
plotosid and clariid species, could begin to operate.
Explicit tests of this scenario will require more detailed
structural and genetic characterizations of these compounds.
The symptoms of envenomation produced by a diverse
array of catfish species' venoms are very similar and a large
number of putative toxins appear to fall within a welldefined molecular weight range. The conserved molecular
weight patterns and toxic effects of catfish venom peptides
suggest two possible scenarios for the evolution of venoms in catfishes: widespread convergent evolution of catfish venom toxins with similar targets and thus similar
molecular characteristics and effects, or common origins
of toxic peptides with subsequent species-specific alterations. The widespread presence of venom glands shown
by the character optimization evidence discussed above
strongly suggests that the latter case is the more parsimonious and likely scenario, even in cases where phylogenetic resolution of basal siluriform divergences is lacking.

Conclusion
This study utilizes several lines of investigation to increase
our knowledge of several poorly understood areas of the
biology of venomous catfishes. These investigations have
demonstrated that at least 1250, and possibly over 1600
species of catfishes may be venomous, a number far
greater than any previous estimate of venomous catfish
diversity. In conjunction with previous systematic studies,
these findings also offer insight into the evolutionary history of venom glands in the order Siluriformes, indicating
at least two independent evolutionary origins of these
structures. Finally, the symptoms of catfish envenomation, along with preliminary biochemical characterizations of toxic catfish venom peptides, may suggest a novel
selective explanation for the evolution of catfish venom
glands and their secretions.
Finer-scale studies of venom gland evolution in fishes will
require continued systematic studies of venomous fish
families to elucidate the relationships of the species contained therein. Additionally, examinations of the chemical composition of fish venoms and the identities and
structures of their constituents will provide valuable
insight into the mechanisms and potential selective factors driving venom evolution in fishes, as well as their
potential for biomedical research and pharmaceutical
bioprospecting.

Methods
Venom Gland Survey and Histological Techniques
The right pectoral-fin spine was removed from 158 catfish
specimens (see Additional file 1), housed in the fish collection of the University of Michigan Museum of Zoology.
Spines were decalcified in CalEx® according to the manufacturer's instructions, after which segments from the distal third of the spine of an appropriate size for histological
preparation were removed. These segments were subjected to automated dehydration and paraffin infiltration
and embedding at the Tissue Core Facility of the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center. Serial sections of 0.7 microns were then obtained from each spine
sample. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin
and mounted on glass slides.

Spines were examined for the presence of venom glands
using a Nikon YS2-T compound microscope. Morphological confirmation of the presence of venom gland cells was
achieved by comparisons with previously published photomicrographs of venom glands in catfishes and spiny
rayed fishes [20,35,44,45], descriptions of piscine venom
gland cellular anatomy [20], and sections obtained from
the spines of catfish species that have been shown to
secrete venomous substances by previous studies [13,20].
When a representative of a particular genus was found to
possess venom glands, all members of that genus were

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/282

presumed to be venomous, except in the case of the ictalurid genus Ameiurus, where the examination of multiple
species within the genus indicated otherwise. These
generic counts of venomous species formed the basis for
the minimum estimate of venomous catfish species
(Table 1). The number of species contained in unexamined genera from families containing venomous representatives was added to the minimum estimate to give a
maximum estimate of venomous catfish species (Table 1).
Venom gland extract preparation and assay
Representatives of the catfish families Ariidae, Bagridae,
Callichthyidae, Ictaluridae, Mochokidae, Pangasiidae,
Pimelodidae, Pseudopimelodidae, and Plotosidae were
obtained either from field collections (Ictaluridae) or the
aquarium trade (other families). Specimens were euthanized using MS-222 at a concentration of 300 mg/L in
fresh water. All further preparations were carried out
either on ice or under refrigeration at 4°C. Spines and caudal fin tissue were removed from each specimen, rinsed in
physiological saline and gently scraped with a microspatula in order to remove any excess epidermal secretions,
and weighed to the nearest 0.001 g using a GeneMate digital balance. Spines were minced and then further homogenized in a 2 mL Dounce homogenizer along with either
marine (Plotosidae) or freshwater (other families) euteleost physiological saline at a volume of 2 mL/g of tissue
[46]. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 6,000 rpm
at 4°C for 20 minutes and the supernatant collected. The
supernatant served as the crude venom extract. Control
extracts prepared from caudal fin tissue were prepared in
the same manner.

Largemouth Bass were collected from Boyden Creek,
Washtenaw Co., MI in October of 2008. Bass were anesthetized in MS-222 at a concentration of 75 mg/L of fresh
water and weighed to the nearest 0.1 g. They were then
placed in 10 G experimental aquaria in a room with natural light and allowed to acclimate for a period of 72 hours.
After the 72 hour acclimation period, bass were injected in
the caudal peduncle at a depth of 2 mm with 2 μL/g body
weight of either crude venom extract or control extract.
Individuals were then observed at one minute, one hour,
and 24 hours after injection for symptoms consistent with
envenomation (Table 2). For each species of catfish tested,
two bass were injected with venom extract and two were
injected with caudal fin control extract.
Character Optimization Analyses
Several previously published phylogenetic hypotheses for
the order Siluriformes [26,28,30] were examined using
MacClade 4.0 PPC [47]. Presence and absence of venom
glands was traced onto the trees using the criterion of
maximum parsimony. Specific taxa that were present in
the phylogenetic reconstruction but which were not

examined in the current study were coded as ambiguous
(?) within the data matrix.

SDS-PAGE Analyses
Crude extracts were prepared for SDS-PAGE analysis by
reduction with NuPAGE® reducing agent and loading
buffer, according to manufacturer's instructions. Reduced
samples were subjected to electophoresis in NuPAGE® precast 4-12% Bis-Tris polyacrylamide gels in 1× MES running buffer for 35 minutes, at 200 V in an x-Cell
SureLock™ Mini Cell. Reduced peptides were visualized
using SimplyBlue™ SafeStain according to manufacturer's
instructions. Molecular weights of venom and caudal fin
extracts were estimated by comparison with Novex® Sharp
Protein Standard. Proteins unique to venom extracts (relative to caudal-fin extracts) were treated as putative toxins,
pending further characterization.
