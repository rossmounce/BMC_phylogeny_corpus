Abstract
Background: The enzyme porphobilinogen synthase (PBGS), which is central to the biosynthesis
of heme, chlorophyll and cobalamins, has long been known to use a variety of metal ions and has
recently been shown able to exist in two very different quaternary forms that are related to metal
ion usage. This paper reports new information on the metal ion independence and quaternary
structure of PBGS from the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus.
Results: The gene for R. capsulatus PBGS was amplified from genomic DNA and sequencing
revealed errors in the sequence database. R. capsulatus PBGS was heterologously expressed in E.
coli and purified to homogeneity. Analysis of an unusual phylogenetic variation in metal ion usage
by PBGS enzymes predicts that R. capsulatus PBGS does not utilize metal ions such as Zn2+, or Mg2+,
which have been shown to act in other PBGS at either catalytic or allosteric sites. Studies with
these ions and chelators confirm the predictions. A broad pH optimum was determined to be
independent of monovalent cations, approximately 8.5, and the Km value shows an acidic pKa of ~6.
Because the metal ions of other PBGS affect the quaternary structure, gel permeation
chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation experiments were performed to examine the
quaternary structure of metal ion independent R. capsulatus PBGS. The enzyme was found to be
predominantly hexameric, in contrast with most other PBGS, which are octameric. A protein
concentration dependence to the specific activity suggests that the hexameric R. capsulatus PBGS
is very active and can dissociate to smaller, less active, species. A homology model of hexameric R.
capsulatus PBGS is presented and discussed.
Conclusion: The evidence presented in this paper supports the unusual position of the R.
capsulatus PBGS as not requiring any metal ions for function. Unlike other wild-type PBGS, the R.
capsulatus protein is a hexamer with an unusually high specific activity when compared to other
octameric PBGS proteins.

Background
The enzyme porphobilinogen synthase (PBGS, EC
4.2.1.24) catalyzes the first common step in the biosynthesis of the tetrapyrrole pigments such as heme, chlorophyll, and cobalamin [1]. PBGS is very highly conserved
in sequence and structure but contains a remarkable phylogenetic variation in metal ion usage for catalytic and
allosteric functions [2,3]. As of 2003, approximately onehalf of the ~130 PBGS sequences available contained the
binding determinants for a catalytic zinc ion, and about
one-half did not [2]. On the other hand, approximately
90% of the known PBGS sequences contain the binding
determinants for an allosteric magnesium. The only
known PBGS sequences that lack the binding determinants for both the catalytic zinc and the allosteric magnesium are in the bacterial genus Rhodobacter [2]. These
atypical PBGS expressed by Rhodobacter sphaeroides and
Rhodobacter capsulatus were two of the earliest PBGS
enzymes to be characterized in the pioneering work of
Shemin and coworkers and were erroneously chosen as
representative of PBGS from all photosynthetic organisms
[4,5]. However, one distinct difference between the ∝-proteobacteria, of which R. capsulatus is an example, and
other photosynthetic organisms is the biosynthetic pathway used to produce the PBGS substrate, 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA). The ∝-proteobacteria synthesize ALA
from succinyl-CoA and glycine while other photosynthetic organisms use glutamic acid to make ALA [6].
In light of the vast information now available on phylogenetic variations in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis and on the
PBGS that require a catalytic zinc and/or that utilize an
allosteric magnesium, the current study revisits the PBGS
of Rhodobacter capsulatus with emphasis on understanding
the enzyme's unique characteristics. Since other PBGS
have been shown to absolutely require divalent cations
for catalytic activity, and in light of the enhanced purity of
modern reagents, it is important to revisit the metal ion
requirements of R. capsulatus PBGS to test the predictions
of the sequence analysis that suggests the absence of any
metal binding determinants. Herein we present evidence
that there is absolutely no effect of Zn2+ or Mg2+ on the
activity of the enzyme and no other metal ions appear to
be required for enzyme function. Prior studies have also
shown that some PBGS enzymes exhibit a pH rate profile
whose pKa value is altered by the presence of monovalent
cations [7,8]. Hence, we include an analysis of enzyme
activity in relation to pH and monovalent cations.
The native holoenzyme quaternary structure for PBGS
from most species is a homo-octamer as supported by 18
deposited PBGS crystal structures from yeast, human, E.
coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and noncrystallographic
cross-linking data on PBGS from the green plant pea [914]. However, an alternative hexameric structural variant

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/5/17

was revealed by the crystal structure of a rare allele of
human PBGS [15]. The hexameric structure suggests a
functional relationship between binding of the allosteric
magnesium of most PBGS and a putative hexameroctamer distribution that serves as the structural basis for
allosteric regulation of enzyme function [15]. In the
absence of the binding sites for either catalytic or allosteric
metal ions we investigated the oligomeric structure of R.
capsulatus PBGS, and results suggest that the protein is a
homo-hexamer. We present a homology model of the
hexameric R. capsulatus PBGS structure.

Results
Cloning and sequencing
The cloning of the hemB gene (which encodes PBGS) from
R. capsulatus was accomplished by PCR using primers
based upon the sequence of Indest and Biel [[16], GenBank accession U14593]. The sequence of the cloned gene
differed from that published previously. Figure 1 presents
an alignment of the predicted polypeptides based on the
published R. capsulatus and R. sphaeroides sequences (GenBank accession number AAL 26883) as well as the
sequence determined from our PCR product (GenBank
accession number AY618996). The changes in the predicted polypeptides are due to three differences that we
observe when comparing the nucleotide sequence determined herein with the published sequence: a deletion of
G at position 425, an insertion of an A at position 468,
and reversal of the AC at positions 643–644 to CA. The
first two sequence differences result in alteration of the
predicted amino acid sequence from amino acids 72 to
86. The third sequence difference alters the amino acid at
position 145 from leucine to isoleucine. Based on the
aligned polypeptide sequence, the newly determined
sequence appears more homologous to R. sphaeroides
PBGS, and hence is deduced to be the correct sequence.
Expression and purification
As demonstrated in Figure 2, we were able to express and
achieve substantial purification of R. capsulatus PBGS. The
specific activities of the ultracentrifuge supernatant, redissolved ammonium sulfate pellet, phenyl-sepharose pool,
DEAE pool, and concentrated S-300 pool were 130, 250,
212, 176, and 364, µmol h-1 mg -1 respectively. We suspect
that some of this variation is due to a protein concentration dependence to the specific activity (see below). The
enzyme has an apparent molecular weight that is in agreement with the predicted mass of 35.8 kDa (Figure 2).
Based on SDS-PAGE and silver staining, the protein
appears to have been purified to homogeneity.
Protein concentration dependence of the specific activity
Other PBGS that lack the catalytic zinc ion binding site
have been shown to exhibit a protein concentration
dependence to the specific activity [7-9] This unusual

phenomenon indicates that a maximally active oligomer
can dissociate into less active smaller units. A protein concentration dependent specific activity is illustrated for R.
capsulatus PBGS in Figure 3. The maximal R. capsulatus
PBGS activity, ~450 µmol h-1 mg -1, is the highest ever seen
for a purified PBGS, and the lowest R. capsulatus PBGS
activity, ~150 µmol h-1 mg-1, shows that the smallest oligomeric structure retains significant activity. As shown in
Figure 3, the activity of the smaller unit is significantly different from what is documented for PBGS that lack the
catalytic zinc but contain the allosteric magnesium binding site; in those instances, the smallest oligomers are
inactive [7,9]. Kinetic characteristics described below use
protein concentrations varying from 0.15–15 µg ml-1 and
this variation does not appear to effect the pKa values
apparent from the pH rate profiles, the Km values, or the
effects of metal ions or metal ion chelators, which suggest
that these properties are more or less the same for the largest and smallest oligomer.

PBGS Specific Activity. Protein was varied from 0.01 µg
ml-1 to 40 µg ml-1 and assay times used were 5 min (❍) and 1
h (ᮀ) with the purified R. capsulatus enzyme. The solid line
represents a hyperbolic fit to the activity data presented for
the combined 5 min and 1 h assays. The final pH for the R.
capsulatus assays was 8.3 in BTP-HCI. For comparison, protein concentration curves are presented from previous
experiments for B. japonicum PBGS (+) [7] and P. sativum
PBGS (∆,) [9] and the hyperbolic fits are presented as dotted
and dashed lines respectively.

Kinetic characteristics
Metal ion requirements of purified R. capsulatus PBGS
were determined and the results confirm that the Rhodobacter enzyme is different in its response to a variety of cations compared to most known PBGS enzymes. At a
protein concentration of ~1 µg ml-1 there is no significant
stimulation or inhibition of R. capsulatus PBGS by the
addition of Zn2+ or Mg2+ ions. The presence of Zn2+, up to
100 µM, caused no change in activity and inclusion of 10
mM Mg2+ resulted in 86% activity. There is also no apparent inhibition by the addition of 10 mM EDTA or by pretreatment with Chelex resin. Inclusion of 1,10phenanthroline from concentrations of 10 µM – 10 mM
had no effect on R. capsulatus PBGS activity. The purified
enzyme was tested for the presence of zinc and magnesium by atomic absorption spectroscopy; under
conditions where it would have been possible to detect as
little as 0.05 metal ion per subunit, none were detected.

Previous experiments with a wide variety of PBGS
enzymes suggest that monovalent cations can affect the
activity of the enzyme. Such cations were clearly shown to
shift the pH rate profile for some PBGS [7,8]. Results presented in Table I (data obtained at ~1 µg protein ml-1) suggest that there is little if any effect of the monovalent
cations K+, Na+ or NH4+ over a wide range of concentrations (0–100 mM). Figure 4 shows that inclusion of 0.1 M
KCl has no significant effect on the pH rate profile at 15
µg ml-1 protein concentration.
To determine the optimal pH for the enzyme we determined the Vmax and Km values at ~1 µg ml-1 protein at a
variety of pH values as presented in Figure 4. The results
demonstrate that maximal activity was observed around
pH 8.0, but the enzyme is still very active over a wide

range of pH values. It is also clear that the Km value
drastically increases at lower pH values, which is similar to
what has been observed for other PBGS enzymes e.g.,
human PBGS [17], E. coli PBGS [18], or B. japonicum PBGS
[7]. Based on the references cited, the rise in Km at low pH
appears to be independent of the metal ion requirements
for PBGS.
Quaternary structure
A recent paper described an alternative quaternary structure for a rare allele of human PBGS. The unprecedented
structural change was shown to have significant effects on
the enzyme activity [15]. In contrast to the active octameric human PBGS, a hexameric form observed with the
rare human allele was relatively inactive. The interconversion of these two oligomeric structures was related to the
allosteric regulation of some non-human PBGS by mag-

nesium. To assess the different oligomerization states possible for R. capsulatus PBGS, a native gel analysis was
performed and the gel was stained for enzyme activity followed by Coomassie staining for protein (see Figure 5).
Previous studies have shown that native gel electrophoresis can give good separation of the quaternary structure
forms of PBGS (see also ref [19]). Four different sized
complexes are observed whose mobility fit well to an
mixture of dimer, tetramer, hexamer, and octamer (note
constant charge/mass ratio). As had been seen before for
E. coli PBGS [19], the distribution of these oligomeric
forms is altered by substrate. By comparing samples preincubated without substrate (Figure 5A, lanes 1 and 4)
with samples preincubated in the presence of substrate
(Figure 5A, lanes 2 and 3) it can be observed that the complex that runs as the smallest form (putative dimer)
becomes less prominent and the largest molecular weight
complex (putative octamer) becomes visible. It is also
interesting to note that no activity is observed for the two
smallest complexes (Figure 5B).
Based upon a combination of size-exclusion chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation, the size of the
major complex was determined. The major component in
size exclusion chromatography ran at an approximate
molecular weight of 220,000 Daltons. The predicted
molecular weight for a monomer is 35,856 Daltons so it
would appear that R. capsulatus PBGS is predominantly a
hexamer.
Ultracentrifugation data for samples collected at several
speeds were fit well using a single species model and show
that the R. capsulatus PBGS is largely a hexamer (Table II).
The molecular weight obtained from a global fit to data
collected at 8,000, 10,000, 12,000 and 14,000 rpm is
215,700 ± 9,700 and was largely independent of speed,
indicating strong evidence for ideal single species behaviour. Since we do observe a slight trend in decreasing
molecular weight with increasing speed, we further analyzed the data by considering more complex two state
models (Table III). The lowest apparent molecular weight
from Table II was no smaller than that expected for a hex-

amer so we mainly considered models with the hexamer
and some larger second state. A lack of lower molecular
weight species is not surprising since the protein concentration dependence of the activity plateaus at about 1 µM
and the loading concentration in the AU is greater than
ten-fold higher. As judged by the square roots of variance
for the fits of the various models to the data, collected

either in dithiothreitol (DTT) or 2-mercaptoethanol
(βME), we saw no appreciable improvement in the fits relative to the pure hexamer model. In the one instance
where a slight improvement was noted (the hexameroctamer model for the βME sample), less than 5% of the
total absorbance could be ascribed to the octamer,
suggesting very little higher order self-association. Pro-

ability in R capsulatus PBGS to form an ion pair or hydrogen bonding interaction at the subunit interface. The differences are tyrosine to phenylalanine or isoleucine,
arginine to glutamine or glycine, valine to isoleucine,
aspartic acid to asparagine or alanine, histidine to
arginine or leucine, and glutamic acid to alanine or asparagine. This analysis is consistent with the observation that
the interactions between PBGS subunits are largely
hydrophilic in character with ordered water molecules at
the subunit interfaces (see Discussion).

Discussion

longed dialysis results in some non-specific aggregation,
presumably due to a build-up of oxidized DTT or βME,
and may provide an explanation for problems with
unwanted aggregation. Finally, we also tested the possibility that the apparent molecular weight from single species
analysis might instead reflect a proportionation between
an octamer and some smaller species. We were able to rule
this out as such models resulted in poorer fits to the data
(e.g. a fit to a tetramer-octamer model is shown in Table
III).
R. capsulatus PBGS hexamer homology model
Figure 6 is an illustration of the homology model of hexameric R. capsulatus PBGS based on a model of hexameric
P. aeruginosa PBGS (see below). Regions of highest uncertainty are places where alignment of R. capsulatus PBGS
and P. aeruginosa PBGS contain insertions and deletions.
These regions are illustrated in the Figure; they are all on
the solvent exposed surface of the oligomer and thus
unlikely to affect subunit interactions. In an attempt to
understand why, unlike other PBGS, R. capsulatus PBGS
does not predominate as an octamer, we analyzed points
of subunit contact in the octamer of the highly homologous P. aeruginosa PBGS. Each P. aeruginosa PBGS monomer contains thirty-six residues that are within 3.2 Å of an
adjacent subunit of the octamer. Twenty-five of these residues are identical in R. capsulatus PBGS; eleven are differ-

Prior to the current work, it appeared that there was a considerable sequence diversion in a 13 amino acid segment
between R. capsulatus and R. sphaeroides PBGS. The revised
sequence for R. capsulatus PBGS presented shows close
homology between the PBGS of the two Rhodobacter species. This is interesting in light of the apparent differences
between these enzymes regarding monovalent cation
usage. The R. sphaeroides enzyme is reported to be stimulated by monovalent cations [5], while the R. capsulatus is
not affected by monovalent cations. While it was previously tempting to ascribe the difference in response
between the enzymes to this region, clearly this is not the
case.
To further analyze the enzymatic characteristics of the R.
capsulatus PBGS, the enzyme was purified after being
heterologously expressed in E. coli. The purification has
allowed us to carry out definitive experiments on the
requirements for R. capsulatus PBGS function.
Based on sequence comparisons and known crystal structures for some PBGS, the Rhodobacter PBGS appear to constitute a unique form of the enzyme that does not require
metal ions for structure, activity, or allosteric regulation
[2]. Although the original description of the Rhodobacter
PBGS enzymes [4,5] did not demonstrate a requirement
for metal ions, the reagents of that time period are now
known to be contaminated with metal ions, particularly
zinc. The current reagents are of better quality, thus

allowing us to confirm the metal requirements for R. capsulatus PBGS. R. capsulatus PBGS activity is independent of
all metal ions tested.

It has been proposed that chloroplast containing photosynthetic organisms use the allosteric regulation of PBGS
by magnesium as part of a complex control of the biosyn-

thesis of chlorophyll [15]. Although Rhodobacter capsulatus
makes a similar pigment, bacteriochlorophyll, the PBGS
enzyme from this organism does not exhibit any regulation by divalent cations. In the absence of the allosteric
magnesium, Rhodobacter must use alternative mechanisms
to prevent the accumulation of photoreactive intermediates in the biosynthesis of its physiologically relevant
tetrapyrroles.
The preferred pH for enzyme function was determined by
measuring Vmax and Km in a systematic fashion. Based
upon these analyses, the apparent pH optimum is approximately pH 8.0, but the enzyme demonstrates significant
activity from pH 7–9. The Km value at optimal pH is still
high (0.5 mM) relative to other PBGS at their optimal pH
in the presence of their required metal ions (~150 µM).
This suggests that an unknown factor may be required in
vivo. Because there have been reports for stimulation of
PBGS enzymes from other organisms by the addition of
monovalent cations, several monovalent cations were
tested for their ability to stimulate enzyme function at the
pH optimum. At the pH optimum no stimulation by
monovalent cations was observed (see Figure 4).
The rare human allele for PBGS encoding F12L revealed
the possibility for alternative quaternary structures of
PBGS that have been proposed to form the basis for allosteric regulation of PBGS that contain an allosteric magnesium binding site [15]. These types of PBGS are found in
all plants, all archaea, and all bacteria except those of the
genus Rhodobacter [2]. Evidence for alternate quaternary
forms of PBGS is particularly apparent for those PBGS that
contain the allosteric magnesium but do not contain the
catalytic zinc, because these forms exhibit a protein concentration dependence to their specific activity as illustrated in Figure 3[7,9,15]. The protein concentration
dependence has been proposed to be due to an
equilibrium between a fully active octamer and an inactive hexamer [15], which is consistent with the data for
pea and B japonicum PBGS presented in Figure 3. The data
for R. capsulatus PBGS suggests however that the active
form of this protein is a hexamer of specific activity ~400
µmol h-1 mg-1, and that this active hexamer can dissociate
into a smaller form that is less active, but not inactive,
with a specific activity of ~150 µmol h-1 mg-1. These observations lead to three interrelated questions. Why does R.
capsulatus PBGS associate into a hexamer rather than an
octamer; why is the R. capsulatus PBGS hexamer of high
activity rather than of low activity; and what is the less
active quaternary structure that is in equilibrium with the
R. capsulatus PBGS hexamer?
To answer these questions, we need to address the factors
that govern the interconversion of PBGS quaternary forms
and the structural basis for the different activities associ-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/5/17

ated with these different quaternary forms. Crystal structures reveal that those PBGS that readily interconvert
between quaternary forms contain subunit-subunit interfaces that are hydrophilic in character. For instance, in the
P. aeruginosa PBGS structure, the interaction of the barrel
of subunit A and the N-terminal arm of subunit B, which
form a hugging interaction, is dominated by hydrogen
bonds and buried water molecules. One could argue that
this type of subunit-subunit interface can readily dissociate because the protein-protein interactions are similar in
energy to aqueous solvation of the protein surfaces
[20,21]. A sequence comparison between P. aeruginosa
PBGS and R. capsulatus PBGS shows that the amino acids
that lie at the hugging dimer interface of the former are of
lower hydrogen bonding and ion pairing capacity in the
latter, which might explain why R. capsulatus PBGS is not
an octamer. As for the functional difference between
human octameric and hexameric PBGS, this has been
ascribed to the mobility/stability of an active site lid that
serves to gate access to solvent [15]. In that case, destabilization of the lid causes the pH rate optimum for the reaction to shift dramatically toward basic pH and causes a
dramatic decrease in affinity for the Km determining substrate molecule since the lid residues form part of the
binding site for this substrate [15]. Consistent with the
fact that R. capsulatus PBGS appears to be a hexamer, the
pH optimum is basic and the Km is 2 – 3 fold higher than
most other PBGS species under their optimal assay conditions. Crystallization trials for R. capsulatus PBGS are currently underway to provide insight into these fascinating
questions. Finally, based on the native gel analysis, we
propose that the active R. capsulatus PBGS hexamer can
dissociate into a less active dimer. Preliminary unpublished results suggest that one can produce an active
dimeric species of human PBGS by destabilizing the
dimer-dimer interactions that are essential for oligomerization of PBGS into either the hexamer or the octamer.

Conclusions
The evidence presented in this paper supports the unusual
position of the R. capsulatus PBGS as not requiring any
metal ions for catalytic function, which may be characteristic of the Rhodobacter genus. Unlike other wild-type
PBGS, the R. capsulatus protein is a hexamer. What
remains to be determined is how the reaction mechanism
for this enzyme might differ from those PBGS that show
both an absolute requirement for metal ions and an octameric quaternary structure.

tein were obtained from Fisher as were Slide-A-Lyzer dialysis cassettes.
Construction of the expression plasmid
The DNA encoding PBGS was amplified from R. capsulatus
genomic DNA by PCR using oligonucleotide primers
(Integrated DNA Technologies) directed to the 5' and 3'
ends of the coding region based on published sequence
[16]. The forward primer PBGS 5' (5'-GCATATGACCCTGATCACCCCCCCC-3') introduced an NdeI site and the
reverse primer PBGS 3' (5'-CGGATCCGCGGTCAGGCGCCGATCAGC-3') introduced a BamHI site. The PCR
reaction was performed using a thermocycler from MWG
Scientific and Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) with the following program: 45 sec at 95°C, 45 sec at 48°C, 1 minute
at 72°C. The resulting PCR fragment was cloned into vector pPCRScript Amp (Stratagene) creating plasmid
pPBGS1. The PCR fragment was removed from the vector
by digestion with NdeI and BamHI and ligated into the
vector pET11a (Novagen) digested with the same
restriction enzymes. The resultant plasmid pPBGS4 was
sequenced in the FCCC DNA Sequencing Facility using
external and internal primers to confirm the sequence in
both directions. For expression, the recombinant plasmid
pPBGS4 was transformed into strain BLR (DE3).
Enzyme expression and purification
A 1 L culture of LB broth with 0.4% glucose was inoculated with a single colony from a fresh transformation and
grown for 16 hours at 37°C. The cells were harvested by
centrifugation (10 min at 10,800 × g) and resuspended in
fresh LB medium containing no glucose, but with 100 µM
isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside
(Research
Organics) and grown for 45 hr at 15°C. From this point
all steps were performed on ice or at 4°C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,800 × g with a
yield of 5.74 g wet weight. The cells were washed with 0.1
M BisTris Propane (BTP, Research Organics) pH 8.5 and
then resuspended in 15 ml of 0.1 M BTP pH 8.5 and lysed
by two passes through a French Press in the presence of
Benzonase™ (Novagen) nuclease and 1 mM AEBSF (Calbiochem). Unbroken cells, inclusion bodies, and debris
were removed by centrifugation for 15 min at 21,500 × g.
The sample was then ultracentrifuged for 1 hour at
141,000 × g to remove membranes. The enzyme was precipitated from solution by treatment with 25%
ammonium sulfate and collected by centrifugation for 20
min at 31,000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in 0.1 M
BTP pH 7.0 and loaded onto a 100 ml Phenyl-Sepharose
(Amersham Biosciences) column pre-equilibrated in 20%
ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M BTP pH 7.0 buffer. The enzyme
was eluted from the column with a two column volume
gradient running from 20% to 0% ammonium sulfate in
30 mM BTP pH 7.0. The PBGS eluted from the column
very close to the end of the gradient. Fractions with spe-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/5/17

cific activity greater than 100 µmol h-1 mg-1 were then
pooled and loaded to a 100 mL DEAE-Sepharose column
equilibrated in 30 mM BTP pH 7.5 and eluted with a two
column volume gradient from 0 to 0.4 M KCl in 30 mM
BTP pH 7.0. The fractions with a specific activity greater
than 300 µmol h-1 mg-1 eluted near the end of the gradient
and were pooled and concentrated using centrifugal concentrators. The concentrated DEAE fraction (0.9 mg ml-1)
was then loaded on to a 300 mL S-300 column (2.6 cm ×
60 cm) (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with 0.1
M BTP pH 7.0, and eluted with the same buffer. The fractions with specific activity greater than 185 µmol h-1 mg-1
were pooled and concentrated. The enzyme appeared to
be greater than 95% pure based on SDS-PAGE analysis.
Enzyme activity assays
Enzyme was pre-incubated in 0.1 M BTP pH 8.6 in the
presence or absence of various metal ions and other reagents for 10 min at 37°C. Assays were initiated by the
addition of ALA-HCl (Aldrich) to a final concentration of
10 mM and were allowed to run for 5 minutes in a final
volume of 1 ml. Assays were terminated by the addition of
0.5 ml of 20% TCA. The product was then quantified by
reaction of the stopped assay mixture with an equal volume of modified Ehrlich's reagent and measurement of
absorbance at 555 nm approximately 8–10 minutes later.
All assays were performed in duplicate or triplicate. If the
amount of product resulted in an absorbance above 1.0
OD, the stopped assay mixture was diluted prior to the
addition of Ehrlich's reagent. Inhibition by 1,10-phenanthroline was carried out as described previously [22]. Inhibition by Chelex 100 resin (BioRad) was assayed by
incubating PBGS in 0.1 M BTP pH 8.5 at 0.05 g resin per
mg enzyme, on ice for 4 hours with occasional stirring,
followed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min to pellet the resin. The resultant enzyme was then assayed. For
determination of monovalent cation effects at pH 8.3, the
enzyme was first dialyzed against 100 mM BTP pH 8.6.
Monovalent cations were added as the chloride salts.
Effect of pH
For assays performed as a function of pH, the buffer was
0.1 M BTP (initial pH 6–9). For determination of Km and
Vmax as a function of pH, the enzyme was at 0.13 µg ml-1.
Since the substrate is an acid, the actual pH values for
assays were determined by running a mock assay without
enzyme and measuring the actual pH of the combined
reaction. When ALA concentration was varied for determination of Vmax, the pH of the assay mixture was adjusted
with 0.5 M HCl to control the final pH. For determination
of the pH rate profile with and without 0.1 M KC1, the
enzyme was at 15 µg ml-1.

Gel electrophoresis
SDS-PAGE was performed using the Laemmli system and
precast 4–20% gradient gels from Cambrex (Rockland,
ME). Gels were stained using a silver stain kit from Pierce
Chemical (Rockford, IL). Native gels were performed
using the same gel system but omitting SDS from all buffers. Activity staining of the gel was performed as described
previously [19]. Following a wash with 20% TCA, the
activity stained gel was then stained with Coomassie blue
to visualize protein bands. Samples for the native gels
were preincubated at a final concentration of 0.15 mg ml1 for 10 minutes in 0.3 M Tris pH 6.8 with additions of
100 µM Zn, 13 mM ALA or both prior to loading. 15 µl of
the preincubated sample was then loaded to each well.
Holoenzyme size determination
The size of the enzyme was determined both by size exclusion chromatography and by analytical ultracentrifugation (AU). Size exclusion chromatography was performed
using a Waters 600 system equipped with a Waters 996
photodiode array for detection of protein elution at 280
nm. The column used was a Superose 6 (10 × 300 mm,
Amersham Pharmacia) and was run at 0.5 ml/min with
100 mM BTP pH 8.6 with 100 µL of a 200 µg ml-1 solution. The column was calibrated with standards obtained
from the manufacturer. For AU experiments, protein samples were dialyzed against 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.7 with
either 0.1 mM DTT or 1 mM βME as reducing agent.
Although TCEP (Tri(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine) is the
preferred reducing agent for such biophysical experiments, we discovered that the oligomeric state was destabilized in the presence of this reagent with other PBGS;
weak chelation of divalent cations has been observed for
this reagent suggesting a mechanism for this destabilization. Protein loading concentrations were 12.3 µM in
monomer (440 µg ml-1). Concentrations were determined
by UV absorption at 280 nm. The extinction coefficient
used for the protein was 29,870 L mol-1 cm-1 and represents the sum of individual tyrosine and tryptophan
absorbance coefficients. Sedimentation equilibrium (SE)
experiments were carried out at 4°C using a Beckman
Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with an
An60 Ti four-hole rotor. Samples were loaded into sixchannel charcoal-filled Epon centerpieces. Temperaturecorrected partial specific volumes and solution densities
were calculated using the Sednterp program [23]; the solution density was 1.00028 g ml-1 and partial specific volume was 0.7304 ml g-1. Data analysis was performed
using the WinNonlin V.1.060 nonlinear least squares
fitting program obtained from the National Analytical
Ultracentrifugation Facility at the University of
Connecticut.

Homology Model Building
The only existing crystal structure on which one can base
a model of hexameric R capsulatus PBGS is that of hexameric human PBGS clinical variant F12L, PDB code 1PV8
[15]. Unfortunately, the crystal structure of F12L shows
significant disorder, which limits its use as the sole foundation for homology model building. However, comparison of human PBGS octameric and hexameric structures
(PDB codes 1E51 and 1PV8) show near identity for the
amino acids that comprise a TIM-like αβ-barrel domain.
The differences between the octamer and the hexamer are
in the 24 N-terminal amino acids and in the disordered
regions [15]. Hence, one can use a higher quality crystal
structure of a PBGS octamer for homology model building the αβ-barrel domain of R. capsulatus PBGS. The chosen structure is PDB code 1GZG [13], which is a highly
ordered, high resolution crystal structure of Pseudomonas
aeruginosa PBGS, and 56% sequence identical to R. capsulatus PBGS. The model building procedure was a two step
process. The first step was construction of a model of a
hexameric form of P. aeruginosa PBGS; the second step was
to use that hexamer to build the R. capsulatus PBGS
hexamer.

P. aeruginosa PBGS hexamer preparation used various
capacities of the program Swiss-PDB Viewer [24] and
some in-house programs. First, the N-terminal arms
(amino acid numbers <32) were removed from the structure file for the 1GZG dimer. The resulting αβ-barrel
domains were successively overlaid upon the three dimers
of hexameric 1PV8 to create a hexameric assembly of P.
aeruginosa PBGS αβ-barrels. There is no significant
sequence identity between the N-terminal arms of human
and P. aeruginosa PBGS, hence there is an alignment ambiguity when trying to build the outstretched arms of the P.
aeruginosa PBGS hexamer. However, there is a region of
the arm that is α-helical in both the human octamer and
the human hexamer. Hence, a structure alignment of octameric forms of human PBGS and P. aeruginosa PBGS was
used to determine the proper sequence alignment for this
α-helical segment. This information was used to spatially
position the amino acids 22 – 29 of P. aeruginosa PBGS in
the hexamer according to the position of this helix in the
hexamer of human PBGS. Loop and side-chain prediction
was performed in a graphical user environment,
developed in the FCCC Molecular Modeling Facility, that
integrates the functions of the programs Loopy [25], and
SCWRL [26]. Within this environment, the program
Loopy [25] was used to model the backbone of amino
acids 29 – 32, so as to connect the N-terminal α-helix to
the αβ-barrel domain of each subunit. The most N-terminal amino acids were built onto the structure within the
Swiss-PDB viewer software using phi, psi, and omega
angle information for the corresponding amino acids of
hexameric human PBGS. Finally, the program SCWRL

Page 11 of 12

[26] was used to position the side chains for the N-terminal arm segments resulting in a model for hexameric P.
aeruginosa PBGS, which could then be used for preparing
hexameric models of other PBGS as we have done before
for the octameric forms of pea and D. melanogaster PBGS
[7,9]. The model for hexameric R. capsulatus PBGS was
built using the same integrated graphical environment
developed in house. This software integrates sequence
alignment, threading, loop model building to accommodate insertions and deletions, and side chain optimization
similar to that used for our previously published models
[7,9].
