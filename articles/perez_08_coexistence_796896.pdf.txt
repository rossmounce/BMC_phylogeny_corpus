Abstract
Introduction: A major diagnostic challenge in the evaluation of a cavitary lung lesion is to
distinguish between infectious and malignant etiologies.
Case presentation: We present the case of an elderly man presenting with fever, hemoptysis and
a left upper lobe cavitary lesion. Serial sputum cultures grew Tsukamurella pulmonis, a rare pathogen
associated with cavitary pneumonia in immunocompromised patients. However, despite clinical
improvement with antibiotic therapy targeted to the organism, concomitant discovery of a papillary
thyroid carcinoma led to a needle biopsy of the cavitary lesion, which showed evidence of primary
lung adenocarcinoma.
Conclusion: This is the first description of Tsukamurella infection in the setting of primary lung
carcinoma. The report also illustrates the potential complex nature of cavitary lesions and
emphasizes the need to consider the coexistence of malignant and infectious processes in all
patients, especially those with risk factors for malignancy that fail to improve on antibiotic therapy.

Introduction
A major diagnostic challenge in the evaluation of a cavitary lung lesion is to determine whether it represents an
infectious or malignant process. In the majority of cases,
it is difficult to distinguish between these two diagnoses
with clinical and radiographic data alone, and more invasive testing is usually required to reach a definitive diagnosis. In this report, we describe our experience with a case
of cavitary pneumonia resulting from the coexistence of
two distinct pathological processes.

Case presentation
A 71-year-old Chinese man who was previously healthy
presented to our clinic with a 3-month history of episodic
cough with the production of thick yellow sputum. This

was accompanied by generalized fatigue, subjective fevers,
weight loss and night sweats. Symptoms improved somewhat with over-the-counter antipyretics and cough suppressants. One month prior to the visit, he noticed streaks
of bright red hemoptysis, which prompted him to seek
medical care. Shortly after an initial chest radiograph
(CXR) showed a left upper lobe cavity, a finding later confirmed by computed tomography (CT) scan (Figure 1), he
was referred to the chest clinic for further evaluation.
The patient was born and raised in China, where he had
lived and worked as a veterinarian for most of his life until
he moved to the US in 1981. He had a negative purified
protein derivative upon arrival to the US. He had no prior
medical problems and was not taking any medication at

the time of his visit. He denied any history of alcohol,
tobacco or recreational drug use and had no knowledge of
sick contacts. On physical examination, he appeared
younger than his stated age and in no apparent distress.
His examination was relevant only for bronchial breath
sounds over the left upper hemithorax.
His CXR and CT scan showed a well-defined left upper
lobe cavitary lesion with associated contralateral mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Due to the suspicious appearance of the lesion, a positron emission tomography (PET)
scan was ordered along with induced sputum for cultures.
Diagnostic bronchoscopy or percutaneous needle biopsy
were discussed with the patient and his family, but he did
not want any invasive tests. The PET scan showed
increased metabolic activity in the left upper lobe lesion
as well as in areas of lymph nodes in the contralateral
mediastinum; in addition, an area in the left lobe of the
thyroid also showed a strong signal which prompted a
referral to the thyroid clinic.
During this time, the first sputum sample grew an acidfast bacillus that was also present in the two subsequent
samples. While the initial suspicion was for Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (TB) or a non-tuberculous Mycobacterium, biochemical studies identified the bacteria as Tsukamurella
pulmonis. Given that infections with this organism can
manifest as cavitary pneumonia, and since the patient
remained symptomatic, we decided to start him on oral

Rifabutin 300 mg daily and oral Levofloxacin 500 mg
daily, a regimen chosen based on the antibiotic susceptibility profile (the organism was resistant only to sulfas
and tetracycline) and available clinical studies in immunosuppressed patients [1].
After starting therapy, he noticed significant clinical
improvement, reduction in sputum volume and resolution of hemoptysis. Upon the recommendation of the
endocrine specialist, an aspiration biopsy of the thyroid
was performed, which revealed papillary thyroid carcinoma. Given our continued concern regarding the pulmonary lesion and the lack of radiographic improvement
after 6 weeks of antibiotic therapy, the patient was again
asked and eventually agreed to undergo a percutaneous
CT-guided biopsy of the left upper lobe lesion. This
revealed adenocarcinoma consistent with a primary lung
origin and associated tissue necrosis without evidence of
infection. While tissue culture grew Tsukamurella, the
organism was not identified in tissue sections or in acidfast stains of tissue sections in which inflammatory
changes were absent. Although subsequent staging suggested that it was amenable to surgical resection, the
patient opted for medical management while continuing
treatment for Tsukamurella infection for a total of 6
months. One year after his last cycle of chemotherapy, the
patient remains in remission and sputum samples
obtained every 3 months after termination of antibiotic
therapy have not shown recurrence of Tsukamurella.

Originally described as a human pathogen in 1982 [2],
members of the genus Tsukamurella belong to the aerobic
actinomycetes and are phylogenetically related to species
of the Rhodococus, Mycobacterium and Nocardia genera.
Morphologically, Tsukamurella is a rod-shaped, Grampositive organism that in most cases demonstrates mild
acid-fast staining; more rarely, it may exhibit more substantial acid-fast staining similar to that seen with the
Mycobacterium species. In culture, growth of Tsukamurella
requires incubation for 48 hours in aerobic conditions
and temperatures between 24 and 37°C. When seeded in
a Lowenstein-Jensen agar, Tsukamurella colonies exhibit a
rough, creamy appearance and, microscopically, these
organisms tend to become arranged either in chains or
dense clusters.

microbiological tests can be performed (Table 1) [2,7].
The importance of making an accurate microbiological
diagnosis is underscored by the fact that Tsukamurella is
resistant to many of the drugs used in the treatment of TB
or non-tuberculous Mycobacteria, such as streptomycin,
cycloserine, rifampin, isoniazid, ethambuthol, p-amino
salicylic acid and capreomycin among others [7]. Thus, a
delay in diagnosis, or inadequate treatment, may promote
progression to cavitary disease and the risk of life-threatening complications, such as massive hemoptysis and respiratory compromise.
While we failed to observe the physical presence of the
organism on the tissue biopsy, the organism grew from
the tissue cultures suggesting that absence of organisms
may have been due to low bacterial load and/or sampling
error. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the
first report of the coexistence of primary lung adenocarcinoma and Tsukamurella in humans. Despite the lack of
reports of such an association, several investigators have
reported a similar event in patients with TB. Given the
limited clinical experience with Tsukamurella infections,
treatment guidelines have not been well established. The
choice of antibiotics is hampered because many of the
antibiotics used to treat TB or non-tuberculous Mycobacteria are ineffective for Tsukamurella. A common approach
to treating cavitary pneumonia due to Tsukamurella in
immunosuppressed patients includes the use of Rifabutin
and a fluoroquinolone for 6 to 9 months, with follow-up
sputum cultures to document bacterial clearance [1]. It
may be useful to perform susceptibility studies in vitro,
however, there are no interpretative breakpoints for the
genus Tsukamurella. Whether other classes of antibiotics
may be equally effective either as single therapy or in combination is unclear at this time. Despite the limited evidence in support of our management strategy, it seems to
have been effective in controlling the patient's infection as

The presentation of pulmonary infections with Tsukamurella bears a striking similarity to the clinical syndrome
seen with mycobacterial infections [2,3]. Clinically,
patients may complain of persistent fever, weight loss,
anorexia, productive cough and hemoptysis. Radiographic evidence of upper lobe infiltrates is not uncommon and, in the absence of therapy, these may progress to
tissue necrosis and cavitation. Immunosuppressed
patients may present initially with cavitary lesions, suggesting a more accelerated course in these individuals [1].
Since the original description of Tsukamurella infection
occurring in the setting of cavitary pneumonia in a patient
who failed traditional tuberculosis therapy, reports of
other clinical syndromes have been described, including
sepsis [3], catheter-related infections [4], conjunctivitis [5]
and infections related to a foreign body [6], among others.
Sputum samples may show the presence of Gram-positive
rods, but the intensity of acid-fast staining is variable,
often leading to confusion with Mycobacteria or Nocardia. To facilitate identification of Tsukamurella, several

no evidence of recurrent growth was obtained after the
treatment period was over. However, future studies
should aim at establishing better guidelines to aid in the
effective management of this infection.

Conclusion
This is the first report of Tsukamurella pneumonia associated with primary lung carcinoma. Although Tsukamurella
is a rare cause of cavitary pneumonia that affects mainly
immunosuppressed and elderly patients, it should be considered in patients failing to respond to traditional antimicrobial or antituberculous therapy. Clinicians should
evaluate patients for malignancy if they fail to respond to
appropriate antimicrobial therapy.
