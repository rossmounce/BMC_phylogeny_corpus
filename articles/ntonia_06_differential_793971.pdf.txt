Background
Feeling an emotion involves several structures and levels
of organization in the brain. Although emphasis has been
given on "bottom-up" systems originating in brainstem
and limbic structures, "top-down" systems originating in
the cerebral cortex are highly intertwined with human
emotionality in regulating these phylogenetically old systems and modulating emotional expression. Moreover,
clinical, EEG and neuroimaging evidence suggetsts a differential involvement of the two cerebral hemispheres in
the processing of different emotional stimuli. The present
study investigates the potentially differential processing of
4 basic emotions (joy, anger, fear, sadness) by the two
hemispheres, as evidenced by the spontaneous conjugate
lateral eye movements produced by the hemispheric activation (frontal eye fields).

Materials and methods
Sixty randomly chosen healthy adult students participated
in an within-subjects design with four emotional levels
(joy, fear, sadness, anger) and two horizontal gaze levels
(left, right). Subjects answered to an ad hoc questionnaire
of 20 questions designed to target particular emotions (4
× 5), in a face-to-face condition with the inreviewer and
were simultaneously videotaped, and they stated the emotion felt with each question. Only horizontal spontaneous
eye movements were recorded for each emotional question.

+ 1.22 L: 1.47 + 0.91; fear R: 1.68 + 0.95 L: 2.05 + 0.64;
sadness R: 1.83 + 0.80 L: 1.78 + 0.97; anger: R: 2.47 + 1.11
L: 1.47 + 0.87. The ANOVA results for the interaction of
the effects of emotion and conjugate lateral eye movements were found to be highly significant (F = 11.1, df =
2.84, Eta2 = 1.59, p = 0.001). After Bonferroni correction,
pair-sampled t-tests were performed for joy (p = 0.001),
anger (p = 0.001), fear (p = 0.055), and sadness (p =
0.076).

Discussion
a) The ad hoc questionnaire used showed a high interrater reliability and construct validity.
b) The indirectly (cognitively) induced emotions interacted significantly with conjugate lateral eye movements.
c) Left hemisphere activation was shown to be significant
for the emotions of joy and anger. Hemispheric lateralization was not significant for fear and sadness.
d) Results may be better explained by an "approach vs
avoidance/separation" behavior dichotomy, rather by a
descriptive "positive vs negative" emotions dichotomy.

Results
Inter-rater reliability of L-R assessments (interviewer vs
videotape) was estimated by Pearson's product moment
correlation (p = 0.001). Construct validity of the questionnaire (targeted vs induced emotion) was estimated by
Pearson's product moment correlation (p = 0.001). The
means of L and R gaze for the 4 emotions were: joy R: 2.48
