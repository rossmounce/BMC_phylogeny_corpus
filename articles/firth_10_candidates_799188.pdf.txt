Candidates in Astroviruses, Seadornaviruses,
Cytorhabdoviruses and Coronaviruses for +1
frame overlapping genes accessed by leaky
scanning
Andrew E Firth1*, John F Atkins1,2*

Abstract
Background: Overlapping genes are common in RNA viruses where they serve as a mechanism to optimize the
coding potential of compact genomes. However, annotation of overlapping genes can be difficult using
conventional gene-finding software. Recently we have been using a number of complementary approaches to
systematically identify previously undetected overlapping genes in RNA virus genomes. In this article we gather
together a number of promising candidate new overlapping genes that may be of interest to the community.
Results: Overlapping gene predictions are presented for the astroviruses, seadornaviruses, cytorhabdoviruses and
coronaviruses (families Astroviridae, Reoviridae, Rhabdoviridae and Coronaviridae, respectively).

Background
Overlapping genes (whereby the same nucleotide
sequence codes for two or more proteins in different
reading frames) are particularly common in RNA
viruses, where they may serve as mechanisms to optimize the coding potential of compact genomes, regulate
gene expression, or circumvent the host cell’s canonical
- though not ubiquitous - rule of ‘one functional protein
per mRNA’. However, such genes can be difficult to
detect using conventional gene-finding software.
MLOGD is a gene-finding program which was
designed specifically for identifying overlapping coding
sequences (CDSs) through the incorporation of explicit
models for sequence evolution in multiply-coding
regions [1-3]. One caveat is that de novo overlapping
CDSs are often considerably less conserved than the
ancestral genes that they overlap (the ancestral gene is
usually the known gene as it tends to be the longer of
the two, while the de novo gene is often very short). The
explicit ‘coding signal’ of such a CDS may be swamped
by the ‘coding signal’ of the ancestral CDS. Thus there
are a number of known overlapping CDSs which

MLOGD fails to detect. Another caveat of MLOGD is
that, if an overlapping CDS is very short and highly conserved (e.g. due to coding in two different reading
frames and perhaps also harbouring an RNA secondary
structure for stimulating ribosomal frameshifting into
the overlapping CDS; [4]), then there may be too few
base variations to obtain a useful signal (either coding
or non-coding). On the other hand, for overlapping
CDSs that are subject to a reasonable degree of purifying selection and that are not too short, MLOGD can
provide a robust detection with just two input sequences
provided that they are sufficiently divergent.
A sometimes more sensitive, but generally less specific, approach involves analysis of conservation at synonymous sites within known CDSs. This method is
particularly useful when a large and diverse input
sequence alignment is available [5,6]. Enhanced conservation may be associated with overlapping functional
elements. However such elements may be either coding
or non-coding, so additional evidence (e.g. conservation
of an overlapping open reading frame and a potential
translation mechanism over a sufficiently divergent
sequence alignment) is required in order to use this
method to identify overlapping CDSs. Care also needs
to be taken to discriminate dual-coding sequences from

regions of enhanced conservation that may arise from
recombination.
Over the past few years we have engaged in a systematic survey of viral genomes for previously undetected overlapping genes. While many of these merit
detailed analysis and experimental follow-up (either
because they are in important and well-studied viruses
or because they involve novel non-canonical translation
mechanisms), there remain a miscellany of promising
candidate new overlapping genes that we are not currently in a position to follow up experimentally but,
nonetheless, may be of interest to the community. The
purpose of this article is to communicate five of these
candidates.

Results and Discussion
Candidate new overlapping CDSs were identified using
either MLOGD or analysis of conservation at synonymous sites within known CDSs. Some candidates were
detected by both methods, while others were only
detected by one (candidates only detected by MLOGD
are typically those for which only a small number of
relevant sequences were available; candidates only
detected by synonymous site conservation are typically
those for which the overlapping CDS is subject to fairly
weak constraints at the amino acid level). In all cases,
candidates were closely inspected for a potential translation mechanism in the context of current knowledge of
the gene expression strategy of the virus in question.
Candidates are summarized in Table 1 and discussed
individually in the following subsections. Coding potential graphs and nucleotide sequence alignments showing
the initiation contexts for each candidate are presented
in the figures. It is interesting to note that all five candidates are in the +1 reading frame relative to the annotated, and most likely ancestral, CDS. In fact the
preference for the evolution of de novo overlapping
genes in the +1 frame, as opposed to the +2 frame, has
been previously noted and appears to be related to
codon (or dicodon) usage in the ancestral CDS [7]. Note
that, in the following, the name ‘ORFX’ will be used
repeatedly to refer to each candidate overlapping CDS.
Mamastrovirus (human, porcine, feline astrovirus clade)

Astroviruses have monopartite positive-sense ssRNA
genomes and are associated with gastroenteritis and
viral diarrhoea in humans and other vertebrates. The
non-structural polyprotein (ORF1a and, via ribosomal
frameshifting, an ORF1a-ORF1b fusion) are translated
from the genomic RNA (gRNA) while the structural
polyprotein (ORF2) is translated from a sub-genomic
RNA (sgRNA) [8,9]. ORFX overlaps the 5’ end of ORF2
in the +1 reading frame. A 112-codon AUG-initiated +1
frame ORF is present in nearly all human astrovirus

sequences in GenBank with complete or partial coverage
of the ORFX region (~780 sequences; ~150 with full
coverage of ORFX; 25 Oct 2009). Just a very small number of sequences are ORFX-defective: one partial
sequence contains a premature termination codon, one
sequence contains a 16-codon 3’ extension, and three
sequences have a CUG codon (which may, nonetheless,
allow a low level of initiation [10]) instead of an AUG
codon at the proposed ORFX initiation site.
An AUG-initiated ORF of similar length (91-122
codons) is present in those feline, porcine, dolphin, sea
lion and dog astroviruses that cluster with the HAstV
human astrovirus clade (see Refs. [11-14] for recent phylogenetic trees). The ORF coincides with a region of
enhanced conservation at ORF2-frame synonymous sites
(Figure 1). This region of enhanced conservation is not
present in the avian astroviruses, which also lack a conserved +1 frame ORF in this region. There is also little
evidence for ORFX in other mammalian astrovirus
clades (ovine, mink, bat and certain human astroviruses
that cluster outside of the classic human-porcine-feline
astrovirus clade) - an equivalent of ORFX may be present in some but certainly not all of these astroviruses.
ORFX appears amenable to translation via leaky scanning (Figure 2). Although the ORF2 AUG initiation
codon generally has a ‘G’ at -3 and a ‘G’ at +4 (strong
though not optimal Kozak context), it also appears to be
positioned very close to the 5’ end of the sgRNA (e.g. 12
nt in human astrovirus; [15]), and it has been shown
that efficient leaky scanning can occur irrespective of
Kozak context when an AUG codon is positioned within
approximately 12 nt of the 5’ end of an mRNA [16,17].
The ORFX AUG codon is typically 41 to 50 nt downstream and has an ‘A’ at -3 and a ‘G’ at +4 (strong
Kozak context; conserved in 149 out of 152 human
astrovirus sequences with coverage of both the ORF2
and ORFX AUG codons). In the porcine, dog and dolphin astrovirus sequences, the ORFX AUG codon is just
20 nt downstream of the ORF2 AUG codon but has an
‘A’ at -3 and a ‘U’ at +4 (medium context). In all cases,
there are no intervening AUG codons in any frame.
Interestingly, a product of the predicted size (12 kDa in
human astrovirus) was observed when sequence corresponding to the sgRNA was translated in vitro [18].
The infectivity of a mutant astrovirus in which ORFX
expression was inadvertently abolished was reduced by
only 50% relative to wild-type virus [19] (a reduction
which may be due to amino acid changes in the polyprotein frame besides the absence of ORFX product),
thus demonstrating that the putative ORFX product is
non-essential - at least for replication in cell culture.
However, this does not imply that ORFX is not a CDS
since the conditions or functions for which the presumed ORFX product is important may not have been

directly tested (e.g. for comparison, the infectivity of a
mutant alphavirus in which expression of the experimentally verified TF protein was abolished was also
reduced by only ~50% [4]).
Seadornavirus segment 7

The seadornaviruses (family Reoviridae) are dsRNA
viruses with 12 genome segments, all of which have so
far been presumed to be monocistronic. These viruses
are transmitted by mosquitoes and the type species,
Banna virus (BAV), has been associated with fever, flulike symptoms and encephalitis in infected humans
[20,21]. ORFX overlaps the 5’-terminal region of the
major CDS of segment 7 (which encodes VP7, a nonstructural protein of uncertain function [22,23]) in the
+1 reading frame. A 52-codon AUG-initiated +1 frame
ORF is present in all available BAV sequences with
complete coverage of the VP7 CDS (six sequences; two
additional sequences have only partial coverage of
ORFX; 16 Nov 2009). Application of MLOGD to the
ORF reveals a strong coding signal (Figure 3). Similarly,
there is greatly enhanced conservation at VP7-frame
synonymous sites within the ORFX region (Figure 3).
Although there is also enhanced conservation at the 5’
end of other seadornavirus segments, the 3’-extent of
the conservation is much greater in segment 7 than
other segments. In all cases, the VP7 CDS utilizes the
first AUG codon, which has a poor Kozak context (’U’
at -3, ‘A’ at +4), while ORFX utilizes the second AUG
codon, which is separated from the first AUG codon by
just 4 nt and has a strong Kozak context (’A’ at -3, ‘G’
at +4; Figure 4). Thus ORFX is amenable to translation
via leaky scanning. Moreover, the close proximity of the
ORFX AUG codon to the VP7 AUG codon may further

enhance initiation at the latter, via the translation initiation coupling mechanism described in Ref. [24].
There are currently two other seadornavirus species
with sequence coverage of the ORFX region - Kadipiro
virus (KDV; 1 sequence), and Liao ning virus (LNV; 2
sequences) [20,25]. When MLOGD was applied to an
alignment of the three species BAV, KDV and LNV, the
results were ambiguous due to the high divergence
between the different sequences. However, there is the
potential, at least, for a functional ORFX in KDV, and
possibly also LNV. In KDV, the VP7 CDS utilizes the
first AUG codon, which has a weak Kozak context,
while the second AUG (separated from the first AUG
by 16 nt) is in the +1 reading frame and heads a 65codon potential ORFX (Figure 4). In LNV, however, the
VP7 CDS has two closely spaced AUG codons in one
sequence, and a medium Kozak context in both
sequences (’G’ at +4), so is sub-optimal for leaky scanning. Moreover, although the next AUG codon is in the
+1 reading frame, it is 64 nt downstream and only
heads a 42-codon ORF. Thus, although there is a very
strong case for a coding ORFX in BAV, whether or not
this ORF is also present in KDV, and especially in LNV,
can not be reliably assessed with the currently available
sequence data.
Cytorhabdovirus (Lettuce necrotic yellows and Lettuce
yellow mottle viruses)

The cytorhabdoviruses comprise a genus within the
family Rhabdoviridae, members of which have monopartite negative-sense ssRNA genomes. Species include Lettuce necrotic yellows virus (LNYV), Lettuce yellow
mottle virus (LYMoV) and Northern cereal mosaic virus
(NCMV). The genomes of LNYV and LYMoV contain

at least six CDSs (N, P, putative movement protein, M,
G, L) while the genome of the much more distantly
related NCMV contains additional ORFs inserted
upstream of M [26-28]. The 97-102 codon ORFX overlaps the 5’ end of the P (phosphoprotein) CDS in the +1
reading frame and is present in LNYV and LYMoV but
apparently not in NCMV (Figure 5).
In fact these two sequences are the only two distinct
sequences with coverage of ORFX currently available in
GenBank (2 Nov 2009). The mean nucleotide identity
between the two sequences within the ORFX region is
only ~50%, which is below the ideal range for MLOGD
(substitution saturation at high divergences makes it

more difficult for MLOGD to distinguish between the
single- and dual-coding models and causes a high-divergence ‘turnover’ in the MLOGD score [1]). Nonetheless,
and notwithstanding the very limited sequence data,
there is a good coding signal for ORFX (Figure 5). In
fact the presence of this ORF has already been noted in
both viruses [27,28] (and designated P’ by Ref. [28])
though, so far as we are aware, this is the first evidence
(apart from its conserved presence) that it is likely to be
coding.
CDSs in the Rhabdoviridae are translated from a series of mRNA transcripts produced via a transcription
termination-reinitiation mechanism, with conserved

junction sequences containing the transcription stop and
start signals located between consecutive CDSs so that
mRNAs are generally monocistronic [26,28,29]. In the
case of the P mRNA of LNYV and LYMoV, the P CDS
utilizes the second AUG codon on the mRNA while the
first AUG codon is in the correct frame for ORFX
translation (Figure 6). However, the ORFX AUG codon
has poor Kozak context (’U’ at -3, ‘A’ or ‘C’ at +4; cf.
[30]), which presumably allows a significant proportion
of ribosomes to translate the P CDS via leaky scanning.
A similarly positioned overlapping CDS (generally
referred to as ‘C’ and generally initiating downstream
rather than upstream of the P initation site) occurs in
certain paramyxovirus genera (e.g. Morbillivirus, Respirovirus) besides Vesicular stomatitis virus (Vesiculovirus,
family Rhabdoviridae), though the C gene is likely to
have arisen independently in the two families [31]. It
has been suggested that the highly variable nature of the
P protein facilitates the evolution of novel genes overlapping its N-terminal regions and, in the absence of
discernable sequence homology, it cannot be assumed
that the resulting proteins have similar functions [31,32].
Coronaviruses

Coronaviruses (family Coronaviridae) belong to the
order Nidovirales. At 26-32 kb, coronavirus genomes
are among the largest of all RNA viruses. As with
other members of the order, these viruses have a
monopartite positive-sense ssRNA genome encoding a
large replicase polyprotein that is expressed from the
genomic RNA (ORF1a and, via ribosomal

frameshifting, an ORF1a-ORF1b fusion product), and a
number of other proteins which are translated from a
nested set of 3’-coterminal sgRNAs [33,34]. The coronaviruses are currently classified into three main
groups (recently elevated to genera) which are further
divided into subgroups, though there are also a large
number of species that await formal classification.
Although a core set of sgRNA-encoded structural proteins (S, E, M, N) are conserved throughout all groups,
a variable number of auxilliary proteins are also
encoded by sgRNAs - including a number of known
overlapping CDSs (e.g. the I CDS that overlaps the N
CDS of some Group 2 coronaviruses [35]). We have
identified two new candidates - one in Group 3 coronaviruses of the proposed subgroup 3c [36], and one
in certain Group 1b coronaviruses. (Note that, while
the evidence for the coding status of the preceding
three candidates is very strong, the evidence for these
two candidates is less certain but should become
clearer as more sequence data become available.)
Coronavirus Group 3c

In the subgroup 3c coronaviruses, ORFX overlaps the
NS6 CDS (between M and N) in the +1 reading frame.
ORFX appears to be present in all available (8 Nov
2009) subgroup 3c sequences with coverage of the NS6
region: Thrush coronavirus (ThCoV), Bulbul coronavirus (BuCoV; 2 sequences), Munia coronavirus
(MuCoV) and Asian leopard cat coronavirus (Figure 7)
[36,37]. ORFX has length 69-89 codons and covers 7381% of NS6 (91-108 codons).

and averaged over a 21 nt sliding window for clarity. The predominantly positive scores indicate that ORFX is likely to be a coding sequence.

ORFX appears amenable to translation via leaky scanning from the same sgRNA as NS6 since the NS6 AUG
initiation codon has a ‘G’, ‘A’ or ‘C’ at -3 (depending on
species) and a ‘U’ at +4 for a medium or weak Kozak
context (Figure 8) and there are no intervening AUG
codons in any frame between the NS6 AUG codon and
the ORFX AUG codon. However, ORFX translation may
be a little more complex since Ref. [36] were unable to
identify a transcription regulatory sequence (TRS;
ACACCA in these viruses) for production of an NS6
sgRNA, which may mean that NS6 is translated via
some non-canonical mechanism (such as reinitiation on
the M sgRNA; cf. [38]; in fact the UAA termination
codon of the M CDS overlaps the AUG initiation codon
of the NS6 CDS as UAAUG; Figure 8). Potential, albeit
imperfect, TRSs between the NS6 and ORFX initiation

codons (Figure 8) may mean that a separate sgRNA is
produced for ORFX. Although Ref. [36] were unsure
about the coding status of NS6 itself (due to the apparent absence of a TRS, and a relatively high Ka/Ks ratio),
our MLOGD analysis suggests that NS6 is coding and is
subject to significantly stronger functional constraints
than ORFX (Figure 7, panel 5).

[39] (just three sequences available), but does not appear
to have a wider phylogenetic distribution among

[GenBank: FJ376620], showing the proposed new coding sequence, ORFX, overlapping the NS6 CDS in the +1 reading frame. (2-5) Coding
potential statistics based on an alignment of five Group 3c coronavirus sequences (see Figure 8 for accession numbers). (2-4) Positions of stop

MLOGD statistics for NS6 relative to a non-coding null model. (6) MLOGD statistics for ORFX (see Figure 3 for details). The predominantly
positive scores indicate that ORFX is likely to be a coding sequence, but is subject to significantly weaker purifying selection than NS6. The
negative scores at the 3’ end of ORFX indicate that the C-terminal region of the putative product is not subject to strong functional constraints.

2009). ORFX appears amenable to translation via leaky
scanning from the same sgRNA as ORF3 since the
ORF3 AUG initiation codon has a ‘G’ at -3 and a ‘U’ at
+4 for a medium to weak Kozak context, and there are
no intervening AUG codons in any frame between the
ORF3 AUG codon and the ORFX AUG codon (Figure
10). ORFX has length 91-95 codons. As with Group 3c
coronavirus NS6, our MLOGD analysis also confirmed
the probable coding status of ORF3, and showed that
ORF3 is subject to significantly stronger functional constraints than ORFX (Figure 9, panel 5).

Conclusions
Overlapping genes are difficult to identify and are often
overlooked. However, it is important to be aware of
such genes as early as possible in order to avoid confusion (otherwise functions of the overlapping gene may
be wrongly ascribed to the gene they overlap), and also
so that the functions of the overlapping gene may be
investigated in their own right. Computational analysis
of sequence data is a time- and cost-efficient way to
find such genes and help direct experimental follow-up.

(1)

The list of new candidate overlapping genes presented
here is by no means complete as we have omitted several candidates that we are currently following up
experimentally, and a number of candidates that are less
certain - for example candidates where a conserved
potential translation mechanism has not been identified,
or candidates where a significant fraction of isolates
contain premature termination codons, or candidates
with too little phylogenetic support within the currently
available sequence databases. To the best of our knowledge (except as noted for cytorhabdovirus) these candiates have not previously been described or annotated
elsewhere, and we apologize if we have accidently
omitted any previous references to any of these
candidates.

Methods
Virus sequences were downloaded from GenBank and
alignments were generated using standard bioinformatics software (blast [40], clustal [41] and EMBOSS
[42]). Candidate overlapping CDSs were identified using
either MLOGD or analysis of conservation at
