Abstract
Background: Toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2) and Caspase Recruitment Domain 15 (CARD15) are
important pattern recognition receptors that play a role in the initiation of the inflammatory and
subsequent immune response. They have been previously identified as susceptibility loci for
inflammatory bowel diseases in humans and are, therefore, suitable candidate genes for
inflammatory disease resistance in cattle. The objective of this study was to identify single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the bovine TLR2 and CARD15 and evaluate the association of
these SNPs with health and production traits in a population of Canadian Holstein bulls.
Results: A selective DNA pool was constructed based on the estimated breeding values (EBVs)
for SCS. Gene segments were amplified from this pool in PCR reactions and the amplicons
sequenced to reveal polymorphisms. A total of four SNPs, including one in intron 10 (c.288614A>G) and three in the exon 12 (c.3020A>T, c.4500A>C and c.4950C>T) were identified in
CARD15; none were identified in TLR2. Canadian Holstein bulls (n = 338) were genotyped and
haplotypes were reconstructed. Two SNPs, c.3020A>T and c.4500A>C, were associated with
EBVs for health and production traits. The SNP, c.3020A>T, for example, was associated with SCS
EBVs (p = 0.0097) with an allele substitution effect of 0.07 score. When compared to the most
frequent haplotype Hap12(AC), Hap22(TC) was associated with increased milk (p < 0.0001) and
protein (p = 0.0007) yield EBVs, and hap21(TA) was significantly associated with increased SCS
EBV(p = 0.0120). All significant comparison-wise associations retained significance at 8%
experimental-wise level by permutation test.
Conclusion: This study indicates that SNP c.3020A>T might play a role in the host response
against mastitis and further detailed studies are needed to understand its functional mechanisms.

Background
Inflammatory diseases such as mastitis, inflammatory
bowel disease, metritis and laminitis are economically
important diseases for the dairy industry. Mastitis is the
most common amongst them, alone accounting for losses
in excess of $2 billion to the US dairy industry [1]. A
number of therapeutic, prophylactic and management
strategies have been proposed to minimize this complex
disease. However, a widely accepted complimentary strategy is based on improving the host genetics through selective breeding. Since it is difficult to use a direct index to
measure the mastitis phenotype, milk somatic cell score
(SCS) is often used as an indirect index to select animals
for breeding [2]. Milk SCS is a log2 score of the milk
somatic cell count and has been genetically correlated
with clinical mastitis (r = 0.7) [3]. It has been demonstrated in sheep that intramammary infections occur less
frequently after one generation of breeding for low
SCS[4]. Breeding strategies in dairy cattle are similarly
based on selection for low estimated breeding values
(EBVs) for SCS [5].
The etiology of mammary inflammatory disorders is
diverse and may include infections caused by bacteria,
parasites, viruses and fungi. In order for an effective host
immune response to occur against a wide variety of pathogens, the host must possess receptors that recognize conserved molecular patterns associated with different classes
of pathogens. These are referred to as pathogen associated
molecular patterns (PAMPs). Receptors that recognize
PAMPs are collectively referred to as pattern recognition
molecules (PRMs) [6]. The PRMs are expressed widely by
different cells including monocytes, granulocytes, dendritic cells and epithelial cells [7]. PAMP recognition leads
to the secretion of cytokines and chemokines by the epithelial cells that recruit effector cells (neutrophils and
monocytes) of the immune system to the site of infection
where they contribute to the host inflammatory immune
response and subsequent acquired immune response.
Phagosomal toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2) is involved in recognizing PAMPs associated with Gram-positive bacteria.
Murine studies for example, have demonstrated that TLR2
is in involved in the early recruitment of neutrophils in
response to intraperitoneal challenge with either Staphylococcus aureus, or peptidoglycan (PGN) from S. aureus [8].
Ruminant studies have demonstrated that TLR2 gene
(designated as 'TLR2') expression occurs in dermal and
gut-associated tissues [9], and is highly induced during
mastitis caused by S. aureus [10]. Bovine TLR2 was
recently radiation hybrid mapped to Bos taurus autosome
(Bta) 17 [11].
Caspase Recruitment Domain 15 (CARD15), also known
as Nucleotide Oligomerization Domain 2 (NOD2), is a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/421

cytosolic protein capable of initiating inflammation following PAMP recognition. The gene encoding bovine
CARD15 (designated as 'CARD15') is located on Bta18. It
was previously categorized as a member of the CATERPILLER family, but was reassigned to the phylogenetically
conserved NLR (NACHT-LRR) protein family [12].
CARD15 shares a common tripartite domain structure
with other members of this family. The tripartite domain
consists of a carboxy (C)-terminal leucine rich repeat
(LRR) domain; a central NACHT (NAIP CIITA HET-E and
TP1) domain, and an amino (N) – terminal domain that
is composed of two CARD domains. The LRR domain is
involved primarily in the recognition of bacterial peptidoglycans (PGN), whereas the central NACHT domain
facilitates self-oligomerization and has ATPase activity.
The CARD domains are known to interact with CARD
containing serine/threonine kinase Rip2 (known as
RICK), via homophilic CARD-CARD interaction; this
leads to the activation of NF-κB [13].
The major portion of the PGN recognition system in
mammals is constituted by CARD15 along with NOD1
and TLR2 [14]. CARD15 is involved in intracellular recognition of muramyl dipeptide (MDP), the minimal bioactive structure of PGN, which is common to the cell wall of
both Gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Therefore, CARD15 acts as a general sensor of bacterial infection [15,16]. A recent study suggests that NOD2 might be
involved in sensing of PGN motifs of S. aureus, after its
phagocytosis [17]. There are several reports of interactions
between CARD15 and other PRMs, especially TLR2 [1820]. This demonstrates the importance of CARD15 in signalling events associated with recognition of different
PAMPs. Polymorphisms, particularly single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs), within the genes coding for different receptor proteins may impair the ability of certain
individuals to respond properly to infections [21]. In the
case of TLR2 and CARD15, they have been identified as
susceptibility loci for different inflammatory bowel diseases in humans [22-25]. It is possible that SNPs within
these genes influence other inflammatory diseases such as
mastitis in cattle. Therefore, understanding the genetic
variation underlying PRMs might help livestock breeders
to identify and select animals with enhanced resistance to
mastitis for breeding programs. The purpose of this study
was to identify SNPs in the bovine TLR2 and CARD15 and
to evaluate the association of these SNPs with SCS and
other production traits in a population of Canadian Holstein bulls.

sequences of CARD15 revealed the presence of four SNPs,
including two transitions: A ↔ G at position c.288614A>G and A ↔ T at position c.3020A>T, and two transversions: A ↔ C at position c.4500A>C and C ↔ T at position c.4950C>T (Figure 1). The nomenclature adopted for
the SNPs was based on the convention described by the
human genome variation society [26]. No SNPs were
found in the promoter sequence from the set of animals
used in this study. SNP c.2886-14A>G was the only polymorphism found in the flanking intronic sequence (14
base pairs upstream of exon 11). All the other SNPs were
found in exon 12. SNP c.3020A>T was found in the coding sequence of exon 12 and is non-synonymous; allele 'A'
producing leucine and allele 'T' producing glutamine in
the peptide sequence. The SNPs were submitted to the
National Centre for Biotechnology Information (RefSNP
rs43710287, rs43710288, rs43710289, rs43710290) and
were released in dbSNP build 126.

Genotypic and allelic frequencies
The genotypic and allelic frequencies are summarized in
Table 1. The individual frequencies of the genotypes were
in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for all the SNPs, as determined by Chi-square test. The calculated Chi-square values ranged from 0.06 to 1.76 and were all non-significant
(p < 0.05). The linkage disequilibrium was evaluated for
all pairs of SNPs using r2. The r2 values ranged from 0.001
to 0.367 and were all significant (p < 0.05) except for the
pair consisting of SNPs c.4500A>C and SNPc.4950C>T.
SNP association analyses
Statistical analyses revealed associations between
CARD15 SNP c.3020A>T and EBVs for milk yield, protein
yield, udder depth, and SCS and between SNP c.4500A>C
and milk yield, fat yield and protein yield. Amongst all the
possible regression models for SCS, a single SNP model
including SNP c.3020A>T was found to be the best model

and showed significant association of this SNP with SCS
(p = 0.0097). The average allele substitution effect of this
SNP for SCS was 0.068, with allele 'T' increasing SCS over
allele 'A' (21% of the SD for SCS EBV). All significant associations were retained at 8% experimental-wise significance level by permutation test. A complete description of
the average allele substitution effects is presented in Table
2.
Haplotype analysis
Two CARD15 SNPs (c.3020A>T and c.4500A>C) were
used for haplotype reconstruction. The estimated haplo-

type frequencies were 42.6%, 26.1%, 19.8% and 11.4%
for Hap12(AC), Hap21(TA), Hap22(TC) and Hap11(AA),
respectively. The linear effects of each of the haplotypes
were estimated by treating the effect of the most frequent
haplotype (Hap12) as a control and contrasting the effects
of the other haplotypes (Hap21, Hap22 and Hap11)
against it (Table 3). Analysis revealed statistically significant differences between Hap21 and Hap12 for SCS and
fat yield, and between Hap22 and Hap12 for milk yield
and protein yield at different levels of significance. All significant associations were retained at 8% experimentalwise level by permutation test.

Discussion
TLR2 and CARD15 play a role in the initiation of inflammatory and immune responses to bacterial infections. A
number of studies have reported that SNPs in PRMs of different species play an important role in contributing
towards disease susceptibility. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to identify SNPs in the TLR2 and
CARD15 and to estimate the extent of associations
between these SNPs and SCS, a trait directly related to
udder inflammation. In the current experiment, the DNA
pool used for the purpose of SNP detection was comprised of DNA samples from 40 animals with extreme
EBVs for SCS. The exons, flanking intronic sequences, and
promoter region were targeted for SNP detection. Therefore it is unlikely, that all SNPs in the population were
identified.
Although no SNPs were identified in TLR2, four SNPs
were identified in CARD15; only one SNP was found in
the coding region (c.3020A>T) of this gene. This SNP,
located in exon 12, is a non-synonymous SNP coding the
terminal LRR domain of CARD15 receptor. While allele
'A' at this position codes for glutamine, allele 'T' codes for
leucine. The association of the T allele with increased SCS
and decreased udder depth, which predisposes animals to
mammary infections, indicates that changes in the composition of the LRR domain of CARD15 may contribute to
disease susceptibility. The terminal LRR domains, as in
CARD15, are common to different PRMs and are responsible for PAMP recognition. There are several reports of
polymorphisms in the human and mouse LRR coding
gene segments that contribute to differential binding to
several bacterial components [15,24,27]. In humans,
CARD15 variants have been hypothesized to alter bacterial component recognition by altering the structure of
LRR domain or the adjacent region [23]. It is possible that
SNP c.3020A>T may compromise protein functionality by

altering the conformation of the binding site in a similar
fashion. This could contribute to the development of
inflammatory disorders and warrants further investigation. The association between this SNP and udder depth
might be an indirect result of the genetic correlation that
exists between SCS and udder depth (rg= -0.26) [28].
Strong associations were also observed between the analyzed CARD15 SNPs and production traits. Such associations may be a result of linkage between these SNPs and
other genes on the same chromosome having a significant
effect on these production traits. Significant QTLs have
been found on Bta18 for all the traits used in the analysis.
While QTLs for SCS and udder composite index exist close
to the location of this gene (about 230 kbs apart)[29,30]
on the chromosome, QTLs for milk yield, protein yield
and fat yield were situated farther away (>1,500 kbs apart)
[30-32].
Haplotype reconstruction revealed all four possible
CARD15 haplotypes to be segregating in the sampled
bulls. The second most frequent haplotype (Hap21) differed significantly from the most common haplotype
(Hap12) with respect to its effect on SCS EBVs. In agreement with the results of the allele substitution analyses,
the linear effect of Hap21 carrying the allele 'T' at SNP
position c.3020A>T was significantly different from
Hap12. However, we did not see any difference between
the linear effects of Hap22 and Hap12 for SCS. Strong
associations were observed between Hap22 and milk and
protein yields (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0007 respectively).
Since, Hap22 carries alleles 'T' and 'C', both of which are
associated with increased milk and protein yields, these
results were in agreement with the allele substitution analysis. It is interesting to note that the most common haplotype, Hap12, carries alleles 'A' and 'C' at positions
c.3020A>T and c.4500A>C respectively, and is beneficial

not only for reducing SCS but also for increasing production. Thus selection for Hap12 in the population seems
promising.

An Eppendorf Biophotometer (Berlin, Germany) was
used to assess the DNA concentration and quality on the
basis of absorbance of UV light at 260 (A260) and 280 nm
(A280).

Conclusion
In conclusion, four SNPs in CARD15 in a sample of Canadian Holstein bulls were discovered. Statistical analyses
revealed that SNP c.3020A>T was associated with EBVs for
SCS and udder depth and milk and protein yields, while
SNP c.4500A>C was only associated with milk, fat and
protein yields. The most common haplotypes for these
two SNPs in the population differed significantly for their
effect on SCS. Moreover, the most common haplotype
carried alleles at both loci that are favourable for reducing
SCS and increasing production EBVs. This implies that
these two SNP, together with other gene polymorphisms,
may be potentially used for genetic selection for mastitis
resistance and production. The findings of this study indicate that SNP c.3020A>T is a candidate for further detailed
studies on its functional mechanisms.

Methods
Resource population
The resource population consisted of 2166 Holstein bulls
selected on the basis of extreme EBV for either protein
yield or SCS. A total of 338 semen samples of these bulls
were selected within families on the basis of extreme EBVs
for either protein yield or SCS for this study. The EBV's for
SCS, udder depth, milk yield, protein yield and fat yield of
these bulls were obtained from a national genetic evaluation database generated in August 2006 by the Canadian
Dairy Network [33], Guelph, Ontario, Canada, and used
in the association studies. Table 4 provides descriptive statistics of the EBVs of the bulls. The majority of the selected
population consisted of half sib families from 20 sires, the
size of which ranged from 2 to 30 bulls. Semen samples
were kindly provided by Semex Alliance (Guelph,
Ontario, Canada).
DNA extraction
A slightly modified standard phenol chloroform procedure was used to extract DNA from semen samples [34].

Construction of DNA Pools for SNP Detection
Twenty bulls with high and twenty bulls with low EBVs for
SCS were selected from the previously selected 338 animals, to create a DNA pool containing equal amounts of
DNA from each bull. The descriptive statistics of the EBVs
of the bulls used for DNA pooling are given in Table 5.
Individual DNA samples were quantified and diluted
using the PicoGreen dsDNA quantification procedure
(Molecular Probes; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) on a Victor
3 flourescent plate reader (Perkin Elmer, Wellesley, MA),
until the concentration of all 40 DNA samples was 8 ± 1
ng/μl. Equal volumes of DNA from each of the 40 samples
were aliquoted to a common tube to construct the DNA
pool. This pool was used in PCR reactions to amplify the
CARD15 exons and its flanking introns and a 2 kb promoter region, and the TLR2 coding exon, flanking introns
and a 2 kb promoter region. The primers used for SNP discovery in TLR2 and CARD15 are shown in Table 6 and
Table 7 respectively. Each PCR amplicon was sequenced
in forward and reverse directions for SNP discovery. Polymorphisms were detected by scrutinizing the forward and
reverse electropherograms generated from the sequencer.
SNP Genotyping
The tetra-primer Amplification Refractory Mutation System (ARMS)-PCR procedure, as described by Ye et al. [35],
was used to genotype all CARD15 SNPs. This method of
genotyping is simple and economical, involving a single
PCR resaction followed by gel electrophoresis. Primers
were designed using the online primer design facility
made accessible by Ye et al. [36]. The primer sets used for
genotyping each identified SNP are shown in Table 8. The
PCR reactions were performed in a total volume of 10 μl,
containing 10 pmol of each of the inner primers, 1 pmol
of each of the outer primers, 200 μM deoxyribonucleotide
triphosphates, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 1× PCR buffer, and 0.5
units of AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Applied Bio-

reaction, a touchdown profile was followed. For touchdown reactions the annealing temperature was 4°C
higher for the first cycle, decreasing by 1°C per cycle until
the annealing temperature indicated in Table 8 was
reached, then continuing at that temperature in the
annealing step of the remaining cycles. The PCR profile
was as follows: 95°C for 8 min, 34 cycles of 30 s at 94°C,
34 cycles of 30s at annealing temperature (including initial touchdown cycles), and 30s of extension at 72°C,
ending with 5 min at 72°C. The annealing temperatures
are shown in Table 8. A T-GRADIENT thermocycler
(Biometra, Montreal Biotech Inc. Kirkland, Canada) was
used to carry out the reactions. A 8 μl aliquot of the PCR
products was mixed with 2 μl of loading buffer and subjected to horizontal agarose gel (2.5%) electrophoresis.
The gels were stained with ethidium bromide for visualization and the genotypes were determined as shown in
Figure 2.

1 for a homozygote (eg., AA)
Gi = 0 for a Heterozygote (eg., AT )
−1 for a homozygote (eg., TT )
The recoded genotypes are listed in Table 1. Mallow's criterion was used to select the final regression model. Type
I experimental errors were controlled by implementing
permutation test [38]. The traits of interest were milk
yield, fat yield, protein yield, udder depth, and somatic
cell score. For each trait, the power of the analysis was calculated using a software developed and described by Dun-

lap et al. [39], which takes into account the significance
level used, number of independent variables, sample size,
and the coefficient of determination of the multiple
regression model.
Genotype Frequencies
The genotypic frequencies were tested for deviations from
proportions of Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium. This was
performed applying a Chi-square test. The pair-wise level
of linkage disequilibrium was measured using the squared
correlation of the alleles at two loci (r2) [40] and was
tested for significance using a Chi-square test [41]:
2
x df =1 = (n − 3)z 2 ,

lies where the parents lack genotypic information. The
first step estimated the haplotype probabilities for the
sires based on the offspring genotypes and population
allelic frequencies while the second step estimated the offspring-haplotype probabilities based on the sire probabilities and population frequencies. These two steps were
alternately iterated until the estimated population frequencies converged to stable values. The final results were
a set of estimated haplotype probabilities for each animal.
Haplotype effects were estimated by regressing EBV's on
haplotype probabilities, which are expressed as the
expected number of copies of each haplotype. The following model was used for statistical analyses using SAS software (SAS Institute, 1999):

where, n is the number of bulls genotyped and
4

1+ r
z = 0.5 ln(
).
1− r
Haplotype Construction and Analyses
The haplotype probabilities were reconstructed using the
program 'HAPROB' developed by Boettcher et al. [42].
This program is based on an algorithm that uses a twostep Monte Carlo-based approach to estimate haplotype
probabilities for the genotyped members of half-sib fami-

yj = μ +

∑ β Hap
i

ij

+ ej

i =1

where yj is trait EBV of the jth animal, βi is the linear regression coefficient for the ith haplotype, Hapij is the probability of the ith haplotype for the jth bull, ej are random
residual effects. Permutation test was implemented to
control type I experimental-wise errors. For each trait, the
power of the haplotype analysis was calculated using a
software developed and described by Dunlap et al. [39].
