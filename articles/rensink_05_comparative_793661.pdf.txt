Abstract
Background: The Solanaceae is a family of closely related species with diverse phenotypes that
have been exploited for agronomic purposes. Previous studies involving a small number of genes
suggested sequence conservation across the Solanaceae. The availability of large collections of
Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) for the Solanaceae now provides the opportunity to assess
sequence conservation and divergence on a genomic scale.
Results: All available ESTs and Expressed Transcripts (ETs), 449,224 sequences for six Solanaceae
species (potato, tomato, pepper, petunia, tobacco and Nicotiana benthamiana), were clustered and
assembled into gene indices. Examination of gene ontologies revealed that the transcripts within
the gene indices encode a similar suite of biological processes. Although the ESTs and ETs were
derived from a variety of tissues, 55–81% of the sequences had significant similarity at the
nucleotide level with sequences among the six species. Putative orthologs could be identified for
28–58% of the sequences. This high degree of sequence conservation was supported by expression
profiling using heterologous hybridizations to potato cDNA arrays that showed similar expression
patterns in mature leaves for all six solanaceous species. 16–19% of the transcripts within the six
Solanaceae gene indices did not have matches among Solanaceae, Arabidopsis, rice or 21 other
plant gene indices.
Conclusion: Results from this genome scale analysis confirmed a high level of sequence
conservation at the nucleotide level of the coding sequence among Solanaceae. Additionally, the
results indicated that part of the Solanaceae transcriptome is likely to be unique for each species.

Background
The Solanaceae family encompasses a number of species
of agronomic and ornamental importance. With regards
to cultivation for food consumption, in 2003, potato was
the world's fifth largest crop in world-wide production

acreage and the solanaceous vegetables tomato, eggplant,
and pepper ranked 11th, 19th, and 22nd, respectively [1].
Species grown for ornamental purposes include petunia
and Nicotiana species. While not consumed for food, these
horticultural species are a substantial component of the

US agronomic economy. For example, petunia represents
greater than $148M output per year in the US [2]. Tobacco
represents another crop of significant economical importance with $1.6B in crop value in 2003 [3]. A close relative
of tobacco, Nicotiana benthamiana, has been utilized as an
experimental model for viral research and disease resistance studies. Coupled with the robust ability of virus
induced gene silencing to silence transcripts [4], N.
benthamiana has emerged as a model species for disease
resistance research.
The Solanaceae have been bred and developed for a variety of purposes. Potato has been bred for tubers (modified
stems) while tomato, pepper, and eggplant have been
bred for enhanced fruit production. Likewise, petunia has
been bred and selected for floral phenotypes while
tobacco has been bred for leaf size. While these modern
varieties are accentuated for particular morphological features, these species share common taxonomic features of
the Solanaceae such as alternate leaves, flower parts in
five, and fruit as a berry or capsule. Compared with other
plant families such as the Poaceae, the range of genome
sizes of solanaceous species is fairly narrow, ranging from
900 to 4600 Mb per haploid genome [5]. Early studies of
the Solanaceae genome revealed conservation of gene
content among potato, tomato, tobacco, petunia, and eggplant. These studies employed relatively small scale crosshybridization studies using cDNA and random genomic
DNA clones [6] in which a set of 20 tomato cDNA clones
were hybridized with a panel of solanceous species
including Lycopersicon, Solanum, Datura, Petunia, and Nicotiana. For the cDNA clones, there was strong hybridization
across the Solanaceae; however, with the genomic clones
(50 in total), there was a reduced degree of cross-hybridization with the non-Lycopersicon species. These data suggested conservation among the coding sequences while
the non-coding sequences had undergone substantial
divergence.
Conserved gene content prompts the question of conserved gene order, i.e. synteny across the Solanaceae. A
number of solanaceous species have a base chromosome
number of 12 including the main vegetable crop species
potato, tomato, pepper and eggplant. Using markers
developed from tomato, a strong degree of co-linearity
between potato and tomato has been demonstrated with
the differences attributable to paracentric inversions
occurring between these two species [7,8]. Using the same
approach in pepper, 18 homologous linkage blocks
between tomato and pepper could be identified [9]. In
eggplant, tomato markers yet again revealed syntenic
regions among tomato and eggplant [10]. While these
synteny studies utilized anonymous DNA clones as markers, comparative mapping of phenotypes such as fruit
morphology [11], pigmentation [12] and disease resist-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/124

ance [13] revealed syntenous mapping of these traits
across the Solanaceae.
These early studies relied heavily on cDNA and random
genomic clones. The advent of high throughput sequencing projects such as Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) [14]
has resulted in the generation of hundreds of thousands
of sequences for solanaeous species. For this study, a total
of 441,154 ESTs were collected from the public database
(dbEST) representing the solanaceous species tomato
(162,621), potato (189,864), pepper (29,894), tobacco
(26,497), and N. benthamiana (26,918). The available
solanaceous ESTs, along with Expressed Transcripts (ETs),
available in Genbank, can be clustered into gene indices
[15] that represent a non-redundant set of transcripts and
facilitate analysis of redundant EST collections. Using
potato and tomato gene indices, a comparative analysis of
tomato and potato ESTs revealed that approximately 80%
of the potato ESTs had a significant sequence match with
a tomato EST at the nucleotide level (E value cutoff of 1010) [16].
In this study, we report the construction and comparative
analyses of gene indices for six solanaceous species
(tomato, potato, tobacco, pepper, petunia and N. benthamiana). These gene indices represent a total of 116,207
non-redundant sequences which we have utilized to
assess sequence conservation among the Solanaceae on a
genomic scale. We significantly extended previous studies
on sequence similarity and conservation among these species as well as documented more thoroughly the characteristics of the coding portion of the Solanaceae genome.
Using computational methods, we have identified putative orthologs among these species and generated a phylogenetic tree to ascertain the relationship and sequence
divergence among these species. In addition to these computational approaches, we assessed the similarity of
expression profiles in mature leaves to experimentally validate the sequence conservation of these species using heterologous hybridization to potato cDNA microarrays. The
comparison of the solanaceous transcripts to the predicted proteomes of the near-complete genome sequences
of Arabidopsis, rice, as well as to 21 other plant gene indices resulted in the identification of solanaceous transcripts without putative homologs, suggesting that a
portion of these transcripts have a high likelihood of
being unique to the Solanaceae. These analyses provide
insight into the overall sequence conservation among
eudicots (Arabidopsis and Solanaceae) as well as between
the Solanaceae and the monocots (i.e., rice).

Results
Assembly of sequences into gene indices for potato,
tomato, petunia, tobacco, pepper, and N. benthamina
A total of 446,248 sequences for six different Solanaceae
family members were retrieved from Genbank, including
dbEST. All sequences were derived from multiple libraries.
The differences in relative expression levels of the various
transcripts will result in a large number of redundant transcripts within these libraries. In order to analyze the transcriptome on the single transcript level, all sequences for
each species were assembled into a gene index resulting in
a total of 116,207 unique sequences over all six species.
Abundant sequences could be assembled into longer,
more accurate consensus transcripts termed tentative consensus (TC) sequences. Less abundant or lowly expressed
transcripts could not be assembled into larger contigs
resulting in singletons in the assemblies, termed singleton
ESTs or singleton ETs. A summary of the composition of
each gene index is shown in Table 1. The potato gene
index contained the highest number of EST and ET
sequences (190,851) and petunia the lowest number
(8,690). For these species, the number of singleton
sequences remaining after assembly is an indication of the
level of sequencing and the diversity of the libraries
selected for sequencing. Potato (44%), tomato (48%),
and N. benthamiana (49%) have the lowest number of singleton sequences indicating a better coverage of the
respective transcriptome when compared to the higher
number of singletons in tobacco (82%), pepper (67%),
and petunia (64%). Additional EST sequencing may
reduce the number of singletons as it will allow for collapsing of singletons into contigs with increased coverage
and representation of the transcriptome.
Assessment of the transcript sampling
The sequences used for the construction of the gene indices were generated from various diverse libraries that
cover different treatments and stages of development
(Table 2). The tissue sources used for library construction

and sequencing largely reflected the various agronomic
usages and research foci of the different Solanaceae species. For petunia and tomato, most of the sequences were
generated from flower libraries as well as fruit libraries,
reflecting the research interests in flower and fruit development for petunia and tomato. In contrast, for potato a
large number of sequences were generated from stolons
and tubers (Table 2). From all species, sequences from
leaves were available, in some instances challenged with
various stressors. As described below, 76–78% of the
potato and tomato sequences have significant matches
with each other although the sources of the libraries were
very different, i.e. flower and fruit vs. tuber and stolon. For
the Nicotiana species, tobacco and N. benthamiana, most
sequences were generated from mixed tissue or callus
libraries. This resulted in higher unique transcript discovery rates as judged from the ratio of the total number of
sequences versus the number of unique sequences (Table
1). It should be noted that seed libraries, which may contain additional distinct transcripts, were not used for the
sequencing in any of the six species examined in this
study.
Analysis of the GC content of Solanaceae gene indices
We analyzed the GC content (ratio of guanine and cytosine) of all of the sequences. It has been shown that
Poaceae have GC rich genomes and the transcripts cover a
broad range of GC content, whereas eudicot genomes
have a lower GC content and transcripts have narrow symmetrical distribution of GC content [17]. The GC content
range of the transcripts of the gene indices of the six
Solanaceae species was determined (Figure 1). To provide
a reference, the GC content range of the Arabidopsis (eudicot) and rice (monocot) gene indices was determined as
well. The observed GC content of the Solanaceae gene
indices is very similar and in accordance with Arabidopsis.
All have a very symmetrical distribution. The average GC
content for the majority of transcripts ranges from 40–
45%, which is similar to what has been reported

and the total number of sequences from each source calculated. a. For the potato ESTs, 62,931 of the Mixed/Other ESTs were derived
from a series of stolon and tuber cDNA libraries. b. For the N. benthamiana ESTs, 18,817 of the Mixed/Other ESTs were derived from
a single cDNA library constructed by pooling mRNA from abiotic and biotic stressed leaves, roots, and callus.

were the tobacco transcripts which showed a slightly different profile with an overall lower GC content, in contrast to that previously reported [18] and other Solanaceae
species examined in this study.

Functional annotation of the gene indices
Automated annotation of the gene indices was performed
as part of the assembly pipeline. In addition, Gene Ontology (GO) terms which provide a more global representation of the gene functions in a controlled vocabulary [19]

were assigned to the consensus transcripts of the gene
indices. The functional annotations of GO were further
reduced using GO-Slim terms, which provide a more
accurate GO assignment by assigning a higher level annotation in the GO hierarchy. The GO slim assignments for
the six Solanaceae gene indices are shown in Figure 2. A
total of 51,830 sequences within the six Solanaceae gene
indices were assigned GO-Slim terms. The largest functional categories were catalytic activity (14–17%), hydro-

lase activity (11–14%) and transferase (11–12%).
Overall, the relative composition of the sampled transcriptome over the various functional categories was very
similar among the Solanaceae species. In addition, for
every species, representative clones could be annotated to
every functional GOSlim category, further supporting the
representative coverage of the transcriptome throughout
all six species. These data indicate that, although the
number of sequences and cDNA library sources differ

between the six gene indices, the relative functional composition of the transcripts sampled is very similar, further
validating the genomic scale comparisons of this study.
Sequence conservation among six Solanaceae species
Previous reports of sequence conservation within the
Solanaceae were based on a relatively small number of
genes [6]. The availability of six gene indices allowed for
the first genomic scale comparisons of sequence similarity
between multiple solanaceous species. Pair-wise sequence
comparisons of all gene indices were performed using
BLASTN [20] and an E value cutoff of 10-10 was used as a
minimum cutoff for significant sequence similarity at the

nucleotide level. The results are shown in Figure 3. The
number of similar sequences between different gene indices is dependent on the number of sequences available,
the depth of sequencing from the various libraries, and
the tissue diversity represented in the EST collections. For
example, comparison of tomato and potato, the largest
gene indices, revealed that 76–78% of the sequences had
a match in the respective gene index. For the smaller gene
indices, such as N. benthamiana, 81% of the sequences had
matches in potato, whereas the reciprocal comparison
revealed only 29% similar sequences which can be
attributed to the lower number of sequences present in
the N. benthamiana gene index. As expected, increasing the

stringency (E value 10-25) resulted in a lower percentage of
matches (data not shown). The similarities at the nucleotide level were paralleled at the protein level as revealed
by TBLASTX searches (data not shown).
Sequence comparisons of the Solanaceae species were further refined by the identification of putative orthologs at
the nucleotide level among the Solanaceae gene indices.
Orthologs are defined as genes with a common ancestor
before speciation and which have retained their biological
function. The approach we used to identify orthologs [21]
utilizes a reciprocal best hit method and was applied to
the six Solanaceae gene indices (Table 3). For potato and
tomato, the percentage of sequences (39–47%) for which
putative orthologs could be identified was lower than the
percentage of sequences with significant matches (76–
78%), indicating that the identification of orthologs is a
more stringent approach for the identification of transcripts with a conserved function. Overall, with the exception of tobacco, 47–60% of the sequences had a reciprocal
best match within one of the Solanaceae gene indices and
could be classified as a putative ortholog. The clusters of
orthologous genes are available in supplemental Table 1
[see Additional file 1].
Arabidopsis and rice were included to identify orthologs
among the six Solanaceae species, rice, and Arabidopsis.
Due to the higher sequence divergence of these two species, a lower number of orthologs can be expected, however, a total of 308 transcripts could be identified with
reciprocal matches over all eight species. A phylogenetic
tree was constructed based on the sequence alignment of
the concatenated sequences from these 308 transcripts
(see Figure 4). As these 308 transcripts are expected to be
functionally conserved, their sequence divergence was
used to assess the overall sequence divergence between
the six Solanaceae species, Arabidopsis, and rice (Figure
4). Potato and tomato, as well as tobacco and N. benthamiana (both Nicotiana species), form closely related
groups in the tree. Both petunia and the Nicotiana species
are outliers among the Solanaceae, whereas pepper is

more closely related to tomato and potato. As expected,
Arabidopsis and rice form the outliers in the tree. These
results further illustrate the process of sequence divergence during speciation of the Solanaceae.
Identification of transcripts likely unique to Solanaceae
Sequence information generated for a large number of
plant species is primarily available in the form of EST collections while for Arabidopsis [22] and rice [23-25], nearcomplete genome sequences are available. To identify
transcripts likely to be unique to the Solanaceae, the
solanaceous transcripts were compared to 21 other gene
indices as well as the predicted proteomes of rice and

Comparison of the six Solanaceae gene indices to Arabidopsis (blue) and rice (green). Shown is the percentage of
sequences of the Solanaceae gene indices with matches, BLAST score E value cut-off of 10-5 in Arabidopsis and rice

Arabidopsis to provide a representative sampling of plant
genes. Like the Solanaceae, Arabidopsis is a eudicot
whereas rice is a monocot. The Arabidopsis genome has
been re-annotated since its completion [26] and the
refinement of the annotation of rice is an ongoing process
[27]. It is unlikely that a substantial number of novel new
genes will be identified in either of these two species with
the continuing annotation efforts, therefore comparison
to these genomes is indicative of the number of
Solanaceae transcripts not present in these two model species. From the comparison to the proteomes of Arabidopsis and rice (Figure 5), it appeared that there are a number
of potentially novel or highly diverged transcripts among
the Solanaceae family compared to Arabidopsis and rice.
The percentage of sequences from potato, tomato,
tobacco, N. benthamiana and petunia with significant
matches (BLASTX using an E value cutoff of 10-5) in Arabidopsis varied between 70% (potato) and 79% (N.
benthamiana). For rice, the percentages were slightly lower,
between 67% (potato) and 78% (N. benthamiana), consistent with the eudicot nature of the Solanaceae. The sole
exception to this high degree of conservation with these
two model species is tobacco with only 42% of the
tobacco gene index sequences matching an Arabidopsis

protein and 41% matching a rice protein. As indicated in
Figure 1, tobacco also has also a lower percentage of
homologous sequences among other Solanaceae species
examined in this study indicating the presence of unusual
sequences within the available tobacco ESTs and ETs.
To further identify transcripts likely to be unique to the
Solanaceae, all transcripts with no sequence similarity to
Arabidopsis or rice were searched against 21 plant gene
indices [28]. From the initial 116,207 transcripts, a total
of 29,588 transcripts did not have any significant matches
in Arabidopsis, rice, or the other 21 gene indices (see
Table 4). With the exception of tobacco, the number of
Solanaceae unique transcripts ranged between 15% for N.
benthamiana and 22% for potato. The large number of
transcripts without matches in these other plant species
suggests that the Solanaceae contains unique sequences
although this number may decrease as additional plant
sequences become available in the future and more comparative analyses are performed. Overall the average
length of these transcript assemblies was comparable to
the overall average transcript assembly length; 420 bases
compared to 531 bases for the singleton sequences, which
were highly enriched in the Solanaceae-specific sequence

data set. Transcripts with no matches in any of the 23
plant species or among Solanaceae are available in supplemental Table 2 [see Additional file 3].
Next, we determined the number of transcripts unique to
each of the six Solanaceae gene indices. Using TBLASTX,
two different BLAST score cut-off E values were used to
identify transcripts with no significant sequence homology within the Solanaceae. Using an E value cut-off of 105, 26% of the transcripts in any of the six Solanaceae gene
indices had no match among the Solanaceae gene indices;
using the more stringent E value cut-off of 10-10, 21% of
the sequences had no match (see Table 5). Of these transcripts, 19% (E value cut-off of 10-5) or 16% (E value cutoff of 10-10) also did not have significant sequence homology in Arabidopsis, rice, or any of the 21 other plant gene
indices; thus, these transcripts appear unique to each of
the six Solanaceae gene indices based on these comparisons. The largest number of unique transcripts (38%) was
found in tobacco in contrast to the 8–13% unique transcripts found in the other five solanaceous gene indices.
These results indicate that in addition to a large number
of conserved sequences among the Solanaceae, each species contained a subset of sequences likely to be unique to
each species. As these transcripts also did not have significant homology to 21 other plant species for which
sequence data is available, it is unlikely this can be attributed to differences in transcript sampling or the availability of a relatively low number of total sequences.
Expression profiling of solanaceous species
To experimentally validate the level of sequence conservation among the Solanaceae, global expression profiles in
mature leaves were compared using microarrays. Potato
microarrays containing ~12,000 potato cDNA clones were
used to compare global gene expression patterns among
the six Solanaceae species. As all probes on the microarray
were derived from potato, we first assessed whether the
potential sequence divergence of these probes would
affect signal intensities. All probes on the potato array

were searched against the other five Solanaceae gene indices and grouped based on BLASTN similarity score (5%
bins) ranging from <60% to 95–100% sequence identity.
Total RNA isolated from mature leaves of tomato, pepper,
tobacco, petunia and N. benthamiana (query samples) was
labeled with Cy3 and hybridized to the potato cDNA
microarrays with RNA isolated from mature potato leaves
that had been labeled with Cy5 (reference sample). The
sequence similarity between the different Solanaceae species allowed for the detection of transcripts from the various species on the potato microarray for over 80% of the
probes on the microarray. Normalized signal intensities
were calculated for each element and the median intensity
for each group of probes based on the BLASTN similarity
score was plotted (Figure 6). Overall, the signal intensity
increased for probes with a higher sequence similarity
among the Solanaceae species, including potato. If this
trend was attributable to the potential sequence divergence of the probes, it would be expected that the trend
for potato would be different, as the potato RNA provides
a perfect match to the probes on the array. Thus, the
potential sequence divergence of the probes was not the
limiting factor in reliable detection of expression levels for
these heterologous hybridizations. This suggests that
more highly conserved genes were expressed at relatively
higher levels than more diverged genes because the group
of probes with the higher sequence similarity all showed
a higher median expression intensity. More conserved
genes most likely represent "housekeeping" genes that can
be expected to be generally expressed at higher levels.
Alternatively, these probes may contain conserved motifs
and therefore the probes on the microarray will crosshybridize to multiple transcripts resulting in the higher
signal intensities observed on the microarray for these
elements. The number of clones that could be detected on
the microarray was dependent on the species used as target. For the more diverged species, such as petunia, a
lower number of clones were detected on the microarray
(data not shown). Overall, we found similar expression
levels in leaves across the six Solanaceae species used in

this study (not shown), indicating that indeed sequence
conservation may represent a functional similarity as well.
In conclusion, the analyses of microarray data indicated
that for the core genes conserved among Solanaceae with
significant sequence similarity to potato, reliable gene
expression values can be derived from microarrays with
potato cDNA probes.

Discussion
A high degree of sequence conservation among
Solanaceae family members had been suggested previously based on small scale assays and analysis. Here, we
report for the first time, a large scale comparison of six
Solanaceae family members. Although the analyses in this
study confirmed the high degree of sequence conservation, they also revealed a large number of Solanaceae specific transcripts and sequence divergence among
Solanaceae.
Transcript sampling for the Solanaceae gene indices
To date, only a limited amount of genomic sequence data
is (publicly) available for the Solanaceae. Therefore, the
EST sequence data assembled in this study was used to
assess the diversity of transcripts among the Solanaceae.
The assessment of the annotation by GO terms of the six
gene indices indicated an overall similar functional composition of the transcripts. In addition, the analysis of GC
content was consistent with Arabidopsis and among the
Solanaceae, with tobacco being the exception. These data
show that the sequences used in this study provide a valid
representation of the various solanaceous genomes. The
wide range of different library sources of the sequences
did not affect the number of sequence matches among the
different Solanaceae species, indicating the absence of a
high percentage of tissue specific transcripts. This can be
explained by the close developmental relationship
between most plant organs as flowers can be considered

modified leaves and stolons as modified stems. A low
number of tissue specific transcripts were also observed in
Arabidopsis using Massive Parallel Signature Sequencing
[29]. Among five different libraries of callus,
inflorescence, leaves, roots and siliques, less than 0.25%
of the transcripts showed tissue specificity [29]. Also in
maize, using cDNA microarrays, only 7% of the genes
were expressed in a highly tissue specific manner among
seven different organs of maize [30]. In contrast, the
assessment of the frequency of the EST sequences can be
used for the comparative analysis to evaluate differential
expression. This approach has been used for tomato and
potato [16,31], but can only be successfully employed
with a large number of diverse libraries and deep sequencing as most tissue specific transcripts may be expressed at
low levels and therefore be relatively rare and not be sampled by sequencing.
A single microarray platform was successfully applied for
heterologous hybridization of Solanaceae species. For
transcripts with significant sequence similarity to the
potato probes on the cDNA microarray, reliable expression data could be obtained. Similar hybridization characteristics were found using heterologous hybridization to a
fish cDNA microarray [32]; the number of elements that
could be detected on the microarray was correlated with
the phylogenetic distance. Cross-species hybridization
was also shown for human and bovine orthologous genes
on a human cDNA microarray [33]. The global expression
data indicated that the conserved transcripts were
expressed similarly among leaf tissue of the six Solanaceae
species examined.
Solanaceae species contain unique transcripts
Overall, a high degree of sequence conservation among
the Solanaceae was observed in accordance with previous
small scale studies [6]; for up to 81% of the gene index

sequences, significant matches at the nucleotide level
could be found within the Solanaceae, consistent with the
level of sequence conservation observed at the protein
level. Using a more stringent approach of orthology
revealed that for the largest gene indices of potato and
tomato, a putative ortholog could be identified at the
nucleotide level for 47% of the unique transcripts in the
gene index. In addition, comparison of the Solanaceae
gene indices to Arabidopsis, rice, and 21 other gene indices revealed transcripts without matches to these nonsolanaceous species as well as transcripts without matches
to individual Solanaceae species. Depending on the stringency of alignment, 16–19% of the transcripts did not
have a match among the plant sequences examined. A
similar approach was used to identify transcripts specific
for legumes [34]. These results show that between these
closely related species there was still substantial sequence
divergence, which was supported by the sequence divergence among 308 orthologous transcripts of six
Solanaceae, Arabidopsis and rice. The available EST
sequences only provide a snapshot of the genome, thus
the number of unique transcripts may be lower but still be
substantial as the transcript sampling among the

Solanaceae proved to be a representative sampling. The
large number of EST sequences available for tomato and
potato were likely to contain the most abundant transcripts, so a large number of transcripts without sequence
homology is likely to remain with increased EST sequencing until more sequence data is generated.
The outlier for most analyses appeared to be tobacco with
a low number of significant matches among Solanaceae,
Arabidopsis, and rice. No obvious explanation could be
found for this but it is unlikely that tobacco will contain a
much higher plant specific gene content. Matsuoka et al.
[35] report on the EST sequencing of a cell suspension
library of tobacco, which was the origin of a large portion
of the tobacco gene index. In this study, a low number of
tobacco sequences matched sequences from other plant
species, consistent with our analyses. The GO assignments
and the identification of orthologs indicated that the
tobacco sequence sample did contain similar transcripts
as the other five Solanaceae gene indices, validating the
general conclusions for the Solanaceae species in this
study, including tobacco.

The finding of a large number of transcripts without
matches among the Solanaceae species will complicate
the efforts of establishing a single reference genome for
the Solanaceae by sequencing a single representative species. Although a large level of synteny exists between the
Solanaceae, it is unclear how novel genes evolved and
whether there is a large difference in gene content among
the Solanaceae. Fortunately, for three Solanaceae species
(tomato, potato and tobacco), genome sequencing
projects are in progress. The availability of three draft
genome sequences will allow for the detailed analysis of
genome conservation and understanding of the genes
involved in the different phenotypes within the
Solanaceae.

Conclusion
In summary, this study documents for the first time the
genomic scale comparison of the available coding
sequences (ESTs and ETs) from six Solanaceae species.
Sequence comparisons at the nucleotide level among
potato, tomato, pepper, eggplant, tobacco and N. benthamiana, including ortholog analysis, confirmed a high level
of sequence conservation. In addition, phylogenetic analysis and comparative analyses with Arabidopsis, rice and
21 other gene indices revealed sequence divergence during speciation as evidenced by transcripts likely unique
among the Solanaceae and unique to individual
Solanaceae species. Global expression profiling showed
similar expression patterns of conserved genes in mature
leaves among the six solanaceous species.

Methods
Computational methods
Gene indices were constructed essentially as described
[15]. In summary, all available sequences for potato,
tomato, pepper, eggplant and petunia were collected from
Genbank and sequences with over 94% sequence identity
over 40 or more bases with unmatched overhangs of 30
bases in length were placed in clusters using the Paracel
Transcript Assembler to generate tentative consensus
sequences (TC) and singleton ESTs and ETs. The TCs were
searched against a non-redundant protein database to
provide a putative annotation for the TC, with a minimum of 30% identity over 20% of the length of the translated TC. All gene indices are available at [28]. The 21 gene
indices used for searches against the Solanaceae gene indices were: Ice plant (v4.0), Cocao (v1.0), Cotton (v6.0),
Grape (v4.0), Barley (v9.0), Sugar beet (v1.0), Brassica
napus (v1.0), Sunflower (v3.0), Lettuce (v2.0), Lotus
(v3.0), Wheat (v10.0), Maize (v15.0), Medicago truncatula
(v8.0), Onion (v1.0), Pinus (v5.0), Poplar (v2.0), Rye
(v3.0), Sorghum bicolor (v8.0), Sugarcane (v2.1), Soybean
(v12.0) and Spruce (v1.0). GO terms were transitively
annotated based on sequence similarity (E value cutoff of
10-10) to Arabidopsis proteins (Release 5, [26] which has

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/124

been manually curated for molecular function GO terms.
The Plant/GOSlim reduced ontologies were used [36].
Each of the six gene indices was pair-wise matched against
the other gene indices using WU-BLAST [37] with BLASTN
and TBLASTX options. BLAST scores were filtered for significant hits using an E value cut-off as indicated in the
text. Each of the six gene indices were searched against the
predicted rice and Arabidopsis proteome using BLASTX
and the top hit was picked for each entry of the gene indices using an E value cutoff of 10-5. Putative orthologs
among the six Solanaceae species, rice and Arabidopsis
were identified essentially as described [21]. In summary,
the non-redundant sets of eight gene indices were compiled and searched against each other using BLASTN. The
reciprocal best hit pairs with a cutoff E value 10-10 were
clustered to generate the ortholog groups. 308 clusters
which contain at least one transcript from each of the 8
species were selected and one representative sequence for
each species was chosen for each group by counting the
reciprocal matches in the clusters. Multiple sequence
alignments for each of the 308 clusters were performed
and sequences in both ends without consensus matches
were removed. Sequences from each species were concatenated together in the same order and aligned to each other
using CLUSTAL W [38]. A neighbor joining tree was generated using PHYLIP (Phylogeny Inference Package)
(Felsenstein, J. 2004, distributed by the author. Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington,
Seattle).
Microarray hybridizations and data analysis
Potato cDNA microarrays were constructed as described
[39]. Potato, tobacco, tomato, petunia, pepper and N.
benthamiana plants were grown in Percival growth chambers (Percival Scientific, Inc. Perry, IA) at 25°C and 16 h
light for 4–6 weeks. Total RNA was extracted from mature
leaves using the Qiagen RNAesy kit (Qiagen, Valencia,
CA) and labeled as described previously [39].
Hybridization and washing was performed essentially as
described [39]. After the final washing step and spin-drying of the slide, slides were scanned using an Axon scanner at maximum laser power (Axon Instruments, Union
City, CA) at both 532 and 635 nm. The PMT values for
both wavelengths were adjusted to capture a similar
number of normalized counts for each channel.

The TIFF images were quantified using Genepix 5.0 (Axon
Instruments, Union City, CA). The software automatically
flags spots that cannot be found in one of the channels;
these are flagged and excluded from further analysis.
Spots containing > 30% saturated pixels in either channel
or a diameter <70 µm were flagged and not used for subsequent analysis. Local background was subtracted from
the signal value (mean pixel intensity). The data were nor-

malized using the quantile method in the limma package
[40] of BioConductor [41]. Flagged spots were given a
weight of 0 using the weight function within the package
which excludes these spots from affecting the normalization. All analyses used the average of the two on-slide replicates. If one of the two replicates was flagged, the
remaining value was used for analysis.
The microarray data are available at the TIGR Potato functional genomics and Solanaceae resources web pages [42]
and through the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) [43]
under platform accession GPL1901.
