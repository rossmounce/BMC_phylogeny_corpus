in vivo progression to castration-recurrent
prostate cancer

Abstract
Background: There is no cure for castration-recurrent prostate cancer (CRPC) and the mechanisms underlying this
stage of the disease are unknown.
Methods: We analyzed the transcriptome of human LNCaP prostate cancer cells as they progress to CRPC in vivo
using replicate LongSAGE libraries. We refer to these libraries as the LNCaP atlas and compared these gene
expression profiles with current suggested models of CRPC.
Results: Three million tags were sequenced using in vivo samples at various stages of hormonal progression to
reveal 96 novel genes differentially expressed in CRPC. Thirty-one genes encode proteins that are either secreted or
are located at the plasma membrane, 21 genes changed levels of expression in response to androgen, and 8
genes have enriched expression in the prostate. Expression of 26, 6, 12, and 15 genes have previously been linked
to prostate cancer, Gleason grade, progression, and metastasis, respectively. Expression profiles of genes in CRPC
support a role for the transcriptional activity of the androgen receptor (CCNH, CUEDC2, FLNA, PSMA7), steroid
synthesis and metabolism (DHCR24, DHRS7, ELOVL5, HSD17B4, OPRK1), neuroendocrine (ENO2, MAOA, OPRK1,
S100A10, TRPM8), and proliferation (GAS5, GNB2L1, MT-ND3, NKX3-1, PCGEM1, PTGFR, STEAP1, TMEM30A), but neither
supported nor discounted a role for cell survival genes.
Conclusions: The in vivo gene expression atlas for LNCaP was sequenced and support a role for the androgen
receptor in CRPC.

Background
Systemic androgen-deprivation therapy by orchiectomy
or agonists of gonadotropic releasing hormone are routinely used to treat men with metastatic prostate cancer
to reduce tumor burden and pain. This therapy is based
on the dependency of prostate cells for androgens to
grow and survive. The inability of androgen-deprivation
therapy to completely and effectively eliminate all metastatic prostate cancer cell populations is manifested by a
predictable and inevitable relapse, referred to as castration-recurrent prostate cancer (CRPC). CRPC is the end
stage of the disease and fatal to the patient within 16-18
months of onset.

The mechanisms underlying progression to CRPC are
unknown. However, there are several models to explain
its development. One such model indicates the involvement of the androgen signaling pathway [1-4]. Key to
this pathway is the androgen receptor (AR) which is a
steroid hormone receptor and transcription factor.
Mechanisms of progression to CRPC that involve or utilize the androgen signaling pathway include: hypersensitivity due to AR gene amplification [5,6]; changes in AR
co-regulators such as nuclear receptor coactivators
(NCOA1 and NCOA2) [7,8]; intraprostatic de novo
synthesis of androgen [9] or metabolism of AR ligands
from residual adrenal androgens [10,11]; AR promiscuity
of ligand specificity due to mutations [12]; and ligandindependent activation of AR by growth factors [protein
kinase A (PKA), interleukin 6 (IL6), and epidermal
growth factor (EGF)] [13-15]. Activation of the AR can
be determined by assaying for the expression of target

genes such as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) [16]. Other
models of CRPC include the neuroendocrine differentiation [17], the stem cell model [18] and the imbalance
between cell growth and cell death [3]. It is conceivable
that these models may not mutual exclusive. For example altered AR activity may impact cell survival and
proliferation.
Here, we describe long serial analysis of gene expression (LongSAGE) libraries [19,20] made from RNA
sampled from biological replicates of the in vivo LNCaP
Hollow Fiber model of prostate cancer as it progresses
to the castration-recurrent stage. Gene expression signatures that were consistent among the replicate libraries
were applied to the current models of CRPC.

Methods
In vivo LNCaP Hollow Fiber model

The LNCaP Hollow Fiber model of prostate cancer was
performed as described previously [21-23]. All animal
experiments were performed according to a protocol
approved by the Committee on Animal Care of the
University of British Columbia. Serum PSA levels
were determined by enzymatic immunoassay kit (Abbott
Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA). Fibers were removed
on three separate occasions representing different stages
of hormonal progression that were androgen-sensitive
(AS), responsive to androgen-deprivation (RAD), and
castration-recurrent (CR). Samples were retrieved immediately prior to castration (AS), as well as 10 (RAD) and
72 days (CR) post-surgical castration.
RNA sample generation, processing, and quality control

Total RNA was isolated immediately from cells
harvested from the in vivo Hollow Fiber model using
TRIZOL Reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Genomic DNA was removed from
RNA samples with DNaseI (Invitrogen). RNA quality
and quantity were assessed by the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Mississauga, ON, Canada)
and RNA 6000 Nano LabChip kit (Caliper Technologies,
Hopkinton, MA, USA).
Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction

Oligo-d(T)-primed total RNAs (0.5 μg per sample) were
reverse-transcribed with SuperScript III (Invitrogen Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). An appropriate dilution of cDNA and gene-specific primers were combined
with SYBR Green Supermix (Invitrogen) and amplified in
ABI 7900 real-time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA). All qPCR reactions were performed in triplicate. The threshold cycle number (Ct)
and expression values with standard deviations were calculated in Excel. Primer sequences for real-time PCRs are:
KLK3, F’: 5’-CCAAGTTCATGCTGTGTGCT-3’ and

Page 2 of 19

R:’ 5’-CCCATGACGTGATACCTTGA-3’; glyceraldehyde3-phosphate (GAPDH), F’: 5’-CTGACTTCAACAGCGACACC-3’ and R:’ 5’-TGCTGTAGCCAAATTCGTTG-3’).
Real-time amplification was performed with initial denaturation at 95°C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles of twostep amplification (95°C for 15 sec, 55°C for 30 sec).
LongSAGE library production and sequencing

RNA from the hollow fibers of three mice (biological
replicates) representing different stages of prostate cancer
progression (AS, RAD, and CR) were used to make a
total of nine LongSAGE libraries. LongSAGE libraries
were constructed and sequenced at the Genome Sciences
Centre, British Columbia Cancer Agency. Five micrograms of starting total RNA was used in conjunction
with the Invitrogen I-SAGE Long kit and protocol with
alterations [24]. Raw LongSAGE data are available at
Gene Expression Omnibus [25] as series accession number GSE18402. Individual sample accession numbers are
as follows: S1885, GSM458902; S1886, GSM458903;
S1887, GSM458904; S1888, GSM458905; S1889,
GSM458906; S1890, GSM458907; S1891, GSM458908;
S1892, GSM458909; and S1893, GSM458910.
Gene expression analysis

LongSAGE expression data was analyzed with DiscoverySpace 4.01 software [26]. Sequence data were filtered for bad tags (tags with one N-base call) and
linker-derived tags (artifact tags). Only LongSAGE tags
with a sequence quality factor (QF) greater than 95%
were included in analysis. The phylogenetic tree was
constructed with a distance metric of 1-r (where “r”
equals the Pearson correlation coefficient). Correlations
were computed (including tag counts of zero) using the
Regress program of the Stat package written by Ron
Perlman, and the tree was optimized using the Fitch
program [27] in the Phylip package [28]. Graphics were
produced from the tree files using the program TreeView [29]. Tag clustering analysis was performed using
the Poisson distribution-based K-means clustering algorithm. The K-means algorithm clusters tags based on
count into ‘K’ partitions, with the minimum intracluster
variance. PoissonC was developed specifically for the
analysis of SAGE data [30]. The java implementation
of the algorithm was kindly provided by Dr. Li Cai
(Rutgers University, NJ, USA). An optimal value for K
(K = 10) was determined [31].
Principle component analysis

Principle component analysis was performed using
GeneSpring™ software version 7.2 (Silicon Genetics,
CA). Affymetrix datasets of clinical prostate cancer
and normal tissue were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus [25] (accession numbers: GDS1439 and

Romanuik et al. BMC Medical Genomics 2010, 3:43
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1755-8794/3/43

GDS1390) and analyzed in GeneSpring™. Of the 96
novel CR-associated genes, 76 genes had corresponding
Affymetrix probe sets. These probe sets were applied as
the gene signature in this analysis. Principle component
(PC) scores were calculated according to the standard
correlation between each condition vector and each
principle component vector.

Results
LongSAGE library and tag clustering

RNA isolated from the LNCaP Hollow Fiber model was
obtained from at least three different mice (13N, 15N,
and 13R; biological replicates) at three stages of cancer
progression that were androgen-sensitive (AS), responsive to androgen-deprivation (RAD), and castrationrecurrent (CR). To confirm that the samples represented
unique disease-states, we determined the levels of KLK3
mRNA, a biomarker that correlates with progression,
using quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction
(qRT-PCR). As expected, KLK3 mRNA levels dropped
in the stage of cancer progression that was RAD versus
AS (58%, 49%, and 37%), and rose in the stage of cancer
progression that was CR versus RAD (229%, 349%, and
264%) for mice 13R, 15N, and 13N, respectively (Additional file 1). Therefore, we constructed nine LongSAGE
libraries, one for each stage and replicate.
LongSAGE libraries were sequenced to 310,072 339,864 tags each, with a combined total of 2,931,124
tags, and filtered to leave only useful tags for analysis
(Table 1). First, bad tags were removed because they
contain at least one N-base call in the LongSAGE tag
sequence. The sequencing of the LongSAGE libraries
was base called using PHRED software. Tag sequencequality factor (QF) and probability was calculated to
ascertain which tags contain erroneous base-calls. The
second line of filtering removed LongSAGE tags with
probabilities less than 0.95 (QF < 95%). Linkers were
introduced into SAGE libraries as known sequences utilized to amplify ditags prior to concatenation. At a low
frequency, linkers ligate to themselves creating linkerderived tags (LDTs). These LDTs do not represent transcripts and were removed from the LongSAGE libraries.
A total of 2,305,589 useful tags represented by 263,197
tag types remained after filtering. Data analysis was
carried out on this filtered data.
The LongSAGE libraries were hierarchically clustered
and displayed as a phylogenetic tree. In most cases,
LongSAGE libraries made from the same disease stage
(AS, RAD, or CR) clustered together more closely than
LongSAGE libraries made from the same biological
replicate (mice 13N, 15N, or 13R; Figure 1). This suggests the captured transcriptomes were representative of
disease stage with minimal influence from biological
variation.

Identification of groups of genes that behave similarly
during progression of prostate cancer was conducted
through K-means clustering of tags using the PoissonC
algorithm [30]. For each biological replicate (mice 13N,
15N, or 13R), all tag types were clustered that had a
combined count greater than ten in the three libraries
representing disease stages (AS, RAD, and CR) and
mapped unambiguously sense to a transcript in reference sequence (RefSeq; February 28th, 2008) [32] using
DiscoverySpace4 software [33]. By plotting within cluster dispersion (i.e., intracluster variance) against a range
of K (number of clusters; Additional file 1, Figure S2),
we determined that ten clusters best embodied the
expression patterns present in each biological replicate.
This was decided based on the inflection point in the
graph (Additional file 1, Figure S2), showing that after
reaching K = 10, increasing the number of K did not
substantially reduce the within cluster dispersion.
K-means clustering was performed over 100 iterations,
so that tags would be placed in clusters that best represent their expression trend. The most common clusters
for each tag are displayed (Figure 2). In only three
instances, there were similar clusters in just two of the
three biological replicates. Consequently, consistent
changes in gene expression during progression were
represented in 11 patterns. Differences among expression patterns for each biological replicate may be
explained by biological variation, the probability of sampling a given LongSAGE tag, and/or imperfections in
K-means clustering (e.g, variance may not be a good
measure of cluster scatter).
Gene ontology enrichment analysis

We conducted Gene Ontology (GO) [34] enrichment analysis using Expression Analysis Systematic Explorer (EASE)
[35] software to determine whether specific GO annotations were over-represented in the K-means clusters.
Enrichment was defined by the EASE score (p-value ≤
0.05) generated during comparison to all the other clusters
in the biological replicate. This analysis was done for each
biological replicate (3 mice: 13N, 15N, or 13R).
To enable visual differences between the 11 expression
trends, the clusters were amalgamated into five major
trends: group 1, up during progression; group 2, down
during progression; group 3, peak in the RAD stage; group
4, constant during progression; and group 5, valley in
RAD stage (Figure 2). To be consistent, the GO enrichment data was combined into five major trends which
resulted in redundancy in GO terms. To simplify the GO
enrichment data, similar terms were pooled into representative categories. Categorical gene ontology enrichments
of the five major expression trends are shown in Figure 3.
These data indicate that steroid binding, heat shock protein activity, de-phosphorylation activity, and glycolysis all

in the stage that was CR. Interestingly, steroid hormone
receptor activity continues to increase throughout progression. Both of these expression trends were observed for
genes with GO terms for transcription factor activity or
secretion. The GO categories for genes with kinase activity
and signal transduction displayed expression trends with

peaks and valleys at the stage that was RAD. The levels of
expression of genes involved in cell adhesion rose in the
stage that was RAD, but dropped again in the stage that
was CR.
Altogether, genes with functional categories that were

prostate cancer to castration-recurrence (Figure 3). For
example, GO terms steroid binding, steroid hormone
receptor activity, heat shock protein activity, chaperone
activity, and kinase activity could represent the cytoplasmic events of AR signaling. GO terms transcription
factor activity, regulation of transcription, transcription
corepression activity, and transcription co-activator activity could represent the nuclear events of AR signaling.
AR-mediated gene transcription may result in splicing
and protein translation, to regulate general cellular
processes such as proliferation (and related nucleotide
synthesis, DNA replication, oxidative phosphorylation,
oxioreductase activity, and glycolysis), secretion, and
differentiation.
It should be noted, however, that both positive and
negative regulators were represented in the GO enriched
categories (Figure 3). Therefore, a more detailed analysis
was required to determine if the pathways represented
by the GO-enriched categories were promoted or inhibited during progression to CRPC. Moreover, many of
the GO enrichments that were consistent with changes
in the AR signaling pathway were generic, and could be
applied to the other models of CRPC.

Figure 2 K-means clustering of tag types with similar
expression trends. PoissonC with K = 10 (where K = number of
clusters) was conducted over 100 iterations separately for each
biological replicate (mice 13N, 15N, and 13R) and the results from
the iterations were combined into consensus clusters shown here.
Plotted on the x-axes are the long serial analysis of gene expression
(LongSAGE) libraries representing different stages of prostate
progression: AS, androgen-sensitive; RAD, responsive to androgendeprivation; and CR, castration-recurrent. Plotted on the y-axes are
the relative expression levels of each tag type, represented as a
percentage of the total tag count (for a particular tag type) in all
three LongSAGE libraries. Different colors represent different tag
types. Each of the ten clusters for each biological replicate are
labeled as such. ‘No equivalent’ indicates that a similar expression
trend was not observed in the indicated biological replicate. Eleven
expression patterns are evident in total and are labeled on the left.
K-means clusters were amalgamated into five major expression
trends: group 1, up during progression; group 2, down during
progression; group 3, peak in the RAD stage; group 4, constant
during progression; and group 5, valley in RAD stage.

Pair-wise comparisons were made between LongSAGE
libraries representing the transcriptomes of different stages
(AS, RAD, and CR) of prostate cancer progression from
the same biological replicate (3 mice: 13N, 15N, or 13R).
Among all three biological replicates, the number of consistent statistically significant differentially expressed tag
types were determined using the Audic and Claverie test
statistic [36] at p ≤ 0.05, p ≤ 0.01, and p ≤ 0.001 (Table 2).
The tags represented in Table 2 were included only if the
associated expression trend was common among all three
biological replicates. The Audic and Claverie statistical
method is well-suited for LongSAGE data, because the
method takes into account the sizes of the libraries and
tag counts. Tag types were counted multiple times if they
were over, or under-represented in more than one comparison. The number of tag types differentially expressed
decreased by 57% as the stringency of the p-value
increased from p ≤ 0.05 to 0.001.
Tag types consistently differentially expressed in pairwise comparisons were mapped to RefSeq (March 4th,
2008). Tags that mapped anti-sense to genes, or mapped
ambiguously to more than one gene were not included in
the functional analysis. GO, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
and Genomes (KEGG; v45.0) [37] pathway, and SwissProt
(v13.0) [38] keyword annotation enrichment analyses
were conducted using EASE (v1.21; March 11th , 2008)
and FatiGO (v3; March 11th, 2008) [39] (Table 3). This
functional analysis revealed that the expression of genes

Figure 3 Gene Ontology enrichments of the five major expression trends. Plotted on the x-axis are Gene Ontology (GO) categories
enriched in one or more of the five major expression trends. On the z-axis the five major expression trends correspond to Figure 2 and are:
group 1, up during progression; group 2, down during progression; group 3, peak in the RAD stage; group 4, constant during progression; and
group 5, valley in RAD stage. The y-axis displays the number of biological replicates (number of mice: 1, 2, or 3) exhibiting enrichment. The latter
allows one to gauge the magnitude of the GO enrichment and confidence.

involved in signaling increased during progression, but
the expression of genes involved in protein synthesis
decreased during progression. Cell communication
increased in the stage that was RAD but leveled off in the
stage that was CR. Carbohydrate, lipid and amino acid

synthesis was steady in the RAD stage but increased in
the CR stage. Lastly, glycolysis decreased in the RAD
stage, but was re-expressed in the CR stage (Table 3).
Tag types differentially expressed between the RAD and
CR stages of prostate cancer were of particular interest
(Table 4). This is because these tags potentially represent
markers for CRPC and/or are involved in the mechanisms
of progression to CRPC. These 193 tag types (Table 2)
were mapped to databases RefSeq (July 9th, 2007), Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC; July 9th, 2007) [40], or
Ensembl Transcript or genome (v45.36d) [41]. Only 135 of
the 193 tag types were relevant (Table 4) with 48 tag types
that mapped ambiguously to more than one location in
the Homo Sapiens transcriptome/genome, and another 10
tag types that mapped to Mus musculus transcriptome/
genome. Mus musculus mappings may be an indication of
minor contamination of the in vivo LNCaP Hollow Fiber
model samples with host (mouse) RNA. These 135 tag
types represented 114 candidate genes with 7 tag types
that did not map to the genome, 5 tag types that mapped
to unannotated genomic locations, and 9 genes that were
associated with more than one tag type. Table 4 shows the
LongSAGE tag sequences and tag counts per million tags
in all nine libraries. Tags were sorted into groups based on
expression trends. These trends are visually represented in

We cross-referenced these 114 candidate genes with 28
papers that report global gene expression analyses on

tissue samples from men with ‘castration-recurrent’,
‘androgen independent,’ ‘hormone refractory,’ ‘androgenablation resistant,’ ‘relapsed,’ or ‘recurrent’ prostate cancer, or animal models of castration-recurrence [42-69].

Romanuik et al. BMC Medical Genomics 2010, 3:43

The candidate genes were identified with HUGO Gene
Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) approved gene
names, aliases, descriptions, and accession numbers. The
gene expression trends of 18 genes of 114 genes were
previously associated with CRPC. These genes were:
ACPP, ADAM2, AMACR, AMD1, ASAH1, DHCR24,
FLNA, KLK3, KPNB1, PLA2G2A, RPL13A, RPL35A,
RPL37A, RPL39, RPLP2, RPS20, STEAP2, and TACC
(Table 4). To our knowledge, the gene expression trends
of the remaining 96 genes have never before been associated with CRPC (Tables 4 &5).
A literature search helped to gauge the potential of
these 96 genes to be novel biomarkers or therapeutic
targets of CRPC. The results of this literature search
are presented in Table 5. We found 31 genes that
encode for protein products that are known, or predicted, to be plasma membrane bound or secreted
extracellularly (Bioinformatic Harvester). These genes
were: ABHD2, AQP3, B2 M, C19orf48, CD151, CXCR7,
DHRS7, ELOVL5, ENDOD1, ENO2, FGFRL1, GNB2L1,
GRB10, HLA-B, MARCKSL1, MDK, NAT14, NELF,
OPRK1, OR51E2, PLCB4, PTGFR, RAMP1, S100A10,
SPON2, STEAP1, TFPI, TMEM30A, TMEM66, TRPM8,
and VPS13B. Secretion of a protein could facilitate
detection of the putative biomarkers in blood, urine, or
biopsy sample. Twenty-one of the candidate genes are
known to alter their levels of expression in response to
androgen. These genes were: ABHD2, B2 M, BTG1,
C19orf48, CAMK2N1, CXCR7, EEF1A2, ELOVL5,
ENDOD1, HSD17B4, MAOA, MDK, NKX3-1, ODC1,
P4HA1, PCGEM1, PGK1, SELENBP1, TMEM66,
TPD52, and TRPM8 [9,22,70-81]. Genes regulated by
androgen may be helpful in determining the activation
status of AR in CRPC. Enriched expression of a protein in prostate tissue could be indicative of whether a
tumor is of prostatic origin. Eight of these 96 genes
are known to be over-represented in prostate tissue
[75,82-85]. These genes were: ELOVL5, NKX3-1,
PCGEM1, PCOTH, RAMP1, SPON2, STEAP1, and
TPD52. Twenty-six genes (ABHD2, BNIP3, EEF1A2,
ELOVL5, GALNT3, GLO1, HSD17B4, MARCKSL1,
MDK, NGFRAP1, ODC1, OR51E2, PCGEM1, PCOTH,
PGK1, PP2CB, PSMA7, RAMP1, RPS18, SELENBP1,
SLC25A4, SLC25A6, SPON2, STEAP1, TPD52, and
TRPM8) have known associations to prostate cancer
[57,82,86-102]. Six genes (C1orf80, CAMK2N1, GLO1,
MAOA, PGK1, and SNX3) have been linked to high
Gleason grade [58,103,104], and twelve genes (B2 M,
CAMK2N1, CD151, COMT, GALNT3, GLO1, ODC1,
PCGEM1, PCOTH, SBDS, TMEM30A, and TPD52)
have been implicated in the ‘progression’ of prostate
cancer [58,82], and 15 more genes (CD151, CXCR7,
DHRS7, GNB2L1, HES6, HN1, NKX3-1, PGK1,

Page 11 of 19

PIK3CD, RPL11, RPS11, SF3A2, TK1, TPD52, and
VPS13B) in the metastasis of prostate cancer [105,106].
Novel CR-associated genes identify both clinical samples
of CRPC and clinical metastasis of prostate cancer

The expression of novel CR-associated genes were validated in publically available, independent sample sets
representing different stages of prostate cancer progression (Gene Expression Omnibus accession numbers:
GDS1390 and GDS1439). Dataset GDS1390 includes
expression data of ten AS prostate tissues, and ten CRPC
tissues from Affymetrix U133A arrays [47]. Dataset
GDS1439 includes expression data of six benign prostate
tissues, seven localized prostate cancer tissues, and seven
metastatic prostate cancer tissues from Affymetrix U133
2.0 arrays [97].
Unsupervised principal component analysis based on
the largest three principal components revealed separate
clustering of tumor samples representing AS and CR
stages of cancer progression, with the exception of two
CR samples and one AS sample (Figure 4a).
Metastatic prostate cancer is expected to have a more
progressive phenotype and is associated with hormonal
progression. Therefore, the gene expression signature
obtained from the study of hormonal progression may
be common to that observed in clinical metastases.
Unsupervised principal component analysis based on the
largest three principal components revealed separate
clustering of not only benign and malignant, but also
localized and metastatic tissue samples (Figure 4b).

Discussion
Genes that change levels of expression during hormonal
progression may be indicative of the mechanisms
involved in CRPC. Here we provide the most comprehensive gene expression analysis to date of prostate cancer with approximately 3 million long tags sequenced
using in vivo samples of biological replicates at various
stages of hormonal progression to improve over the previous libraries that are approximately 70,000 short tags
or less. Previous large-scale gene expression analyses
have been performed with tissue samples from men
with advanced prostate cancer [42-58], and animal or
xenograft models of CRPC [59-69]. Most of these previous studies compared differential expression between
CRPC samples with the primary samples obtained
before androgen ablation. This experimental design cannot distinguish changes in gene expression that are a
direct response to androgen ablation, or from changes
in proliferation/survival that have been obtained as the
prostate cancer cells progress to more a more advanced
phenotype. Here we are the first to apply an in vivo
model of hormonal progression to compare gene

expression between serial samples of prostate cancer
before (AS), and after androgen ablation therapy (RAD)
as well as when the cells become CR. This model is the
LNCaP Hollow Fiber model [21] which has genomic
similarity with clinical prostate cancer [23] and mimics
the hormonal progression observed clinically in response
to host castration as measured by levels of expression of
PSA and cell proliferation. Immediately prior to castration, when the cells are AS, PSA levels are elevated and
the LNCaP cells proliferate. A few days following castration, when the cells are RAD, PSA levels drop and the
LNCaP cells cease to proliferate, but do not apoptose in
this model. Approximately 10 weeks following castration, when the cells are CR, PSA levels rise and the
LNCaP cells proliferate in the absence of androgen. This
model overcomes some limitations in other studies
using xenografts that include host contamination
of prostate cancer cells. The hollow fibers prevent

A

infiltration of host cells into the fiber thereby allowing
retrieval of pure populations of prostate cells from
within the fiber. The other important benefit of the
fiber model is the ability to examine progression of cells
to CRPC at various stages within the same host mouse
over time, because the retrieval of a subset of fibers
entails only minor surgery. The power to evaluate progression using serial samples from the same mouse
minimizes biological variation to enhance the gene
expression analyses. However, limitations of this model
include the lack of cell-cell contact with stroma cells,
and lack of heterogeneity in tumors. Typically, these features would allow paracrine interactions as expected in
clinical situations. Consistent with the reported clinical
relevance of this model [23], here principal component
analysis based on the expression of these novel genes

samples. Principal component analysis based on the
expression of these genes also revealed separate clustering of the different stages of tumor samples and also
showed separate clustering of the benign samples from
the prostate cancer samples. Therefore, some common
changes in gene expression profile may lead to the survival and proliferation of prostate cancer and contribute
to both distant metastasis and hormonal progression.
We used this LNCaP atlas to identify changes in
gene expression that may provide clues of underlying
mechanisms resulting in CRPC. Suggested models of
CRPC involve: the AR; steroid synthesis and metabolism; neuroendocrine prostate cancer cells; and/or an
imbalance of cell growth and cell death.
Androgen receptor (AR)
Transcriptional activity of AR

The AR is suspected to continue to play an important
role in the hormonal progression of prostate cancer.
The AR is a ligand-activated transcription factor with its
activity altered by changes in its level of expression or
by interactions with other proteins. Here, we identified
changes in expression of some known or suspected
modifier of transcriptional activity of the ARin CRPC
versus RAD such as Cyclin H (CCNH) [107], proteasome macropain subunit alpha type 7 (PSMA7) [108],
CUE-domain-containing-2 (CUEDC2) [109], filamin A
(FLNA) [110], and high mobility group box 2 (HMGB2)
[111]. CCNH and PSMA7 displayed increased levels of
expression, while CUEDC2, FLNA, and HMGB2 displayed decreased levels of expression in CR. The expression trends of CCNH, CUEDC2, FLNA, and PSMA7 in
CRPC may result in increased AR signaling through
mechanisms involving protein-protein interactions or
altering levels of expression of AR. CCNH protein is a
component of the cyclin-dependent activating kinase
(CAK). CAK interacts with the AR and increases its
transcriptional activity [107]. Over-expression of the
proteosome subunit PSMA7 promotes AR transactivation of a PSA-luciferase reporter [108]. A fragment of
the protein product of FLNA negatively regulates transcription by AR through a physical interaction with the
hinge region [110]. CUEDC2 protein promotes the
degradation of progesterone and estrogen receptors
[109]. These steroid receptors are highly related to the
AR, indicating a possible role for CUEDC2 in AR degradation. Thus decreased expression of FLNA or CUEDC2
could result in increased activity of the AR. Decreased
expression of HMGB2 in CRPC is predicted to decrease
expression of at least a subset of androgen-regulated
genes that contain palindromic AREs [111]. Here, genes
known to be regulated by androgen were enriched in
expression trend categories with a peak or valley at the
RAD stage of prostate cancer progression. Specifically, 8

Page 14 of 19

of the 13 tags (62%) exhibiting these expression trends
‘E’, ‘F’, ‘J’, ‘K’, or ‘L’ represented known androgenregulated genes, in contrast to only 22 of the remaining
122 tags (18%; Tables 4 &5). Overall, this data supports
increased AR activity in CRPC, which is consistent with
re-expression of androgen-regulated genes as previously
reported [68] and similarity of expression of androgen
regulated genes between CRPC and prostate cancer
before androgen ablation [23].
Steroid synthesis and metabolism

In addition to changes in expression of AR or interacting proteins altering the transcriptional activity of the
AR, recent suggestion of sufficient levels of residual
androgen in CRPC provides support for an active
ligand-bound receptor [112]. The AR may become reactivated in CRPC due to the presence of androgen that
may be synthesized by the prostate de novo [4] or
through the conversion of adrenal androgens. Here, the
expression of 5 genes known to function in steroid
synthesis or metabolism were significantly differentially
expressed in CRPC versus RAD. They are 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR24) [113], dehydrogenase/
reductase SDR-family member 7 (DHRS7) [114], elongation of long chain fatty acids family member 5
(ELOVL5) [115,116], hydroxysteroid (17-beta) dehydrogenase 4 (HSD17B4) [117], and opioid receptor kappa 1
(OPRK1) [118]. Increased levels of expression of these
genes may be indicative of the influence of adrenal
androgens, or the local synthesis of androgen, to reactivate the AR to promote the progression of prostate cancer in the absence of testicular androgens.
Neuroendocrine

Androgen-deprivation induces neuroendocrine differentiation of prostate cancer. Here, the expression of 8
genes that are associated with neuroendocrine cells were
significantly differentially expressed in CRPC versus
RAD. They either responded to androgen ablation such
as hairy and enhancer of split 6 (HES6) [119], karyopherin/importin beta 1 (KPNB1) [120], monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) [121], and receptor (calcitonin) activity
modifying protein 1 (RAMP1) [122]], or were increased
expressed in CRPC such as ENO2 [122], OPRK1 [118],
S100 calcium binding protein A10 (S100A10) [123], and
transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M
member 8 (TRPM8) [124].
Proliferation and Cell survival

The gene expression trends of GAS5 [125], GNB2L1
[126], MT-ND3, NKX3-1 [127], PCGEM1 [128],
PTGFR [129], STEAP1 [130], and TMEM30A [131]
were in agreement with the presence of proliferating
cells in CRPC. Of particular interest is that we observed
a transcript anti-sense to NKX3-1, a tumor suppressor,

Romanuik et al. BMC Medical Genomics 2010, 3:43
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1755-8794/3/43

highly expressed in the stages of cancer progression that
were AS and CR, but not RAD. Anti-sense transcription
may hinder gene expression from the opposing strand,
and therefore, represents a novel mechanism by which
NKX3-1 expression may be silenced. There were also
some inconsistencies including the expression trends of
BTG1 [132], FGFRL1 [133], and PCOTH [134] and
that may be associated with non-cycling cells. Overall,
there was more support at the transcriptome level for
proliferation than not, which was consistent with
increased proliferation observed in the LNCaP Hollow
Fiber model [21].
Gene expression trends of GLO1 [135], S100A10 [136],
TRPM8 [137], and PI3KCD [138] suggest cell survival
pathways are active following androgen-deprivation and/
or in CRPC, while gene expression trends of CAMK2N1
[139], CCT2 [140], MDK [141,142], TMEM66 [143], and
YWHAQ [136] may oppose such suggestion. Taken
together, these data neither agree nor disagree with the
activation of survival pathways in CRPC. In contrast to
earlier reports in which MDK gene and protein expression
was determined to be higher in late stage cancer [63,142],
we observed a drop in the levels of MDK mRNA in CRPC
versus RAD. MDK expression is negatively regulated by
androgen [65]. Therefore, the decreased levels of MDK
mRNA in CRPC may suggest that the AR is reactivated in
CRPC.
Other

The significance of the gene expression trends of
AMD1, BNIP3, GRB10, MARCKSL1, NGRAP1, ODC1,
PPP2CB, PPP2R1A, SLC25A4, SLC25A6, and WDR45L
that function in cell growth or cell death/survival were
not straightforward. For example, BNIP3 and WDR45L,
both relatively highly expressed in CRPC versus RAD,
may be associated with autophagy. BNIP3 promotes
autophagy in response to hypoxia [144], and the
WDR45L-related protein, WIPI-49, co-localizes with the
autophagic marker LC3 following amino acid depletion
in autophagosomes [145]. It is not known if BNIP3 or
putative WDR45L-associated autophagy results in cell
survival or death. Levels of expression of NGFRAP1
were increased in CRPC versus RAD. The protein product of NGFRAP1 interacts with p75 (NTR). Together
they process caspase 2 and caspase 3 to active forms,
and promote apoptosis in 293T cells [146]. NGFRAP1
requires p75 (NTR) to induce apoptosis. However,
LNCaP cells do not express p75 (NTR), and so it is not
clear if apoptosis would occur in this cell line [147].
Overall, genes involved in cell growth and cell death
pathways were altered in CRPC. Increased tumor burden may develop from a small tip in the balance when
cell growth outweighs cell death. Unfortunately, the
contributing weight of each gene is not known, making

Page 15 of 19

predictions difficult based on gene expression alone of
whether proliferation and survival were represented
more than cell death in this model of CRPC. It should
be noted that LNCaP cells are androgen-sensitive and
do not undergo apoptosis in the absence of androgens.
The proliferation of these cells tends to decrease in
androgen-deprived conditions, but eventually with progression begins to grow again mimicking clinical CRPC.

Conclusion
Here, we describe the LNCaP atlas, a compilation of
LongSAGE libraries that catalogue the transcriptome of
human prostate cancer cells as they progress to CRPC
in vivo. Using the LNCaP atlas, we identified differential
expression of 96 genes that were associated with castration-recurrence in vivo. These changes in gene expression were consistent with the suggested model for a role
of the AR, steroid synthesis and metabolism, neuroendocrine cells, and increased proliferation in CRPC.
Additional material
Additional file 1: Supplementary Figures. Figure S1: qRT-PCR analysis
of KLK3 gene expression during hormonal progression of prostate cancer
to castration-recurrence. RNA samples were retrieved from the in vivo
LNCaP Hollow Fiber model at different stages of cancer progression that
were: AS, androgen-sensitive, day zero (just prior to surgical castration
and 7 days post-fiber implantation); RAD, responsive to androgendeprivation, 10 days post-surgical castration; and CR, castration-recurrent,
72 days post-surgical castration. MNE, mean normalized expression,
calculated by normalization to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAPDH).
Error bars represent ± standard deviation of technical triplicates. Each
mouse represents one biological replicate. Figure S2: Ten K-means
clusters are optimal to describe the expression trends present during
progression to castration-recurrence. K-means clustering was conducted
over a range of K (number of clusters) from K = 2 to K = 20 and the
within-cluster dispersion was computed for each clustering run and
plotted against K. The within-cluster dispersion declined with the
addition of clusters and this decline was most pronounced at K = 10.
The graph of within cluster dispersion versus K shown here is for mouse
13N, but the results were similar for mice 15N and 13R. Figure S3: Trend
