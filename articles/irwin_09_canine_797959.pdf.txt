Abstract
Canine babesiosis is a clinically significant emerging vector-borne disease caused by protozoan
haemoparasites. This review article considers recent literature pertaining to the taxonomic
classification of Babesia and Theileria species affecting dogs and the geographical distribution of
these parasites.The diagnosis of canine babesiosis by traditional, molecular and serological methods
is reviewed, together with recent advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of
piroplasmosis, and of the treatment and prevention of this disease.

Introduction
Canine babesiosis is a common and clinically significant
tick-borne haemoprotozoan disease with a worldwide
distribution. Babesia species are often referred to as
piroplasms, a collective term for phenotypically similar
protozoan parasites that utilise mammalian erythrocytes
in their life cycle. Piroplasms of domestic animals encompass two main genera, Babesia and Theileria, and have
been subject of intense research interest and molecularbased re-classification during the last 10 years. In dogs,
infection by these haemoparasites results in a wide range
of clinical presentations; from subclinical disease to
serious illness characterised by fever, pallor, jaundice,
splenomegaly, weakness and collapse associated with
intra- and extravascular haemolysis, hypoxic injury,
systemic inflammation, thrombocytopenia and pigmenturia [1-3]. Although canine babesiosis is recognised as a

tick-borne disease, transmitted by a variety of welldescribed Ixodid vectors around the world, Babesia gibsoni
is an emerging disease with molecular evidence of clonal
expansion due to non-vectored transmission by blood
exchange during fighting and biting [4-6]. Recent research
into canine babesiosis has focussed on determining the
taxonomic status of well recognised and newly discovered
canine piroplasms, developing improved diagnostic
methods, investigating aspects of pathophysiology and
searching for improved chemotherapeutic and immunoprophylactic protocols.

Taxonomy and molecular phylogeny
The classification of Babesia spp. places them in order
Piroplasmida within the phylum Apicomplexa. Two
morphologically distinct forms of the erythrocytic stage in
the canine host were recognised in early studies that led

Page 1 of 9

Parasites & Vectors 2009, 2(Suppl 1):S4

to the naming of the larger form, measuring approximately 3-5 μm as B. canis, and the smaller (1-3 μm) as
B. gibsoni. Despite painstaking observation of the
parasites in blood films by many early researchers, further
understanding of the taxonomic classification of these
parasites was hampered for the best part of one hundred
years by the fact that within these general size ranges, their
morphological features did not permit further differentiation. The first suggestion that all B. canis isolates were
not identical species came from the German protozoologist Eduard Reichenow who recognised differences in
pathogenicity of “B. canis” isolates from France and North
Africa (these were most likely parasites that are currently
known as B. (canis) canis and B. (canis) vogeli, respectively)
[7,8]. Further clarification did not come until the late
1980s with the advent of molecular tools for phylogenetic
studies; molecular genotyping of canine piroplasms has
resulted currently in the identification of four large and at
least four small parasites, but it is likely that new species
will be added as further isolates are characterised.
“Babesia canis” was reclassified into three sub-species
(B. canis canis, B. canis rossi and B. canis vogeli) on the basis
of cross-immunity, serological testing, vector specificity
and molecular phylogeny; these parasites are now
considered to be separate species in their own right [9,10]
(Table 1). A fourth ‘large’ (as yet unnamed) Babesia sp.
has been described recently in a number of dogs with
clinical signs and haematological parameters consistent
with babesiosis in North Carolina [11,12]. With regard to
small piroplasms, three genetically and clinically distinct
species are currently recognised to cause disease in dogs;
Babesia gibsoni, Babesia conradae (reported in dogs in the
western United States and described in original reports as
“B. gibsoni”) [13,14], and a Babesia microti-like piroplasm
(named Theileria annae) [15,16].
In addition, three Theileria species have been isolated in a
small number of dogs’ blood in Europe (Theileria
(Babesia) equi and Theileria annulata) [17,18] and from 82
dogs in South Africa (unnamed Theileria sp. related to an
isolate obtained from antelope) [19] (Table 1). Until
more information is available the competence of the dog
as a host for these piroplasms is uncertain; the clinical
correlation for these organisms is unknown, and neither
intraerythrocytic nor extraerythrocytic stages have yet
been visualised.
As with many taxonomic debates, the classification of
canine piroplasms has not been without disagreement
among parasitologists, especially concerning nomenclature of the smaller parasites. Furthermore, data from
molecular analysis of the mammalian host stages have far
outstripped our understanding of the life-cycle features of
these organisms, notably identification of their vectors

http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/2/S1/S4

and other important biological data. Under light
microscopy the intraerythrocytic stage of Babesia spp. is
indistinguishable from Theileria spp. (In cats Cytauxzoon is
also similar in appearance, but to date there has been no
report of this genus affecting canines.) Historically these
two genera, Babesia and Theileria, are separated on the
basis of certain life-cycle stages and transovarial passage
within the tick vector [20], yet to date the only piroplasm
of companion animals known to have an extraerythrocytic (schizogony) stage to its life cycle is
Cytauxzoon felis in the cat.
The controversy focuses on whether all small canine
piroplasm species should be classified as Babesia spp. or
whether Theileria spp. infect dogs as part of their natural
life cycle. To inform the debate, molecular studies of
canine piroplasms have predominantly utilised the small
subunit ribosomal 18S gene locus to infer phylogenetic
relationships, favoured for its conserved nature and
predictable rate of mutation, but other rRNA loci,
cytochrome b, and genes encoding the heat-shock proteins
have been also utilised for this purpose [6,18,21].
As noted above, pre-erythrocytic parasite (schizont) stages
in lymphocytes or macrophages, a defining feature of
Theileria, have not been observed in dogs. However, the
formation of distinct tetrad forms (the “Maltese cross”),
considered as a feature of both Theileria spp. and Babesia
microti, has been described in Babesia conradae [14,22].
Babesia conradae appears to be most closely related to a
group of piroplasms found in free-ranging ruminants
(deer and sheep) and isolated from humans in the
western United States – the ‘western clade’ [22]. This
group is phylogenetically distinct from Babesia microti, a
rodent piroplasm with a wide distribution throughout the
Holarctic ecozone (see review [23]) in which schizogony
in lymphocytes has been reported [24]. The piroplasm
species reported in dogs from northern Spain forms into
a clade with Babesia microti and was given the name
Theileria annae [15], but is often referred to as the “Babesia
microti-like” piroplasm or agent, or “Spanish isolate”.
Indisputably Theileria species (Theileria annulata and
Theileria equi) have been detected in canine blood [17,18]
and the most recently reported canine piroplasm, in
South Africa [19], is also phylogenetically aligned with
recognised Theileria spp., yet as stated previously their
significance is unclear at the present time.

Geographical distribution
The distribution maps for canine vector-borne diseases
are continually changing as new information about
parasite infections and ranges comes to light. In general it
may be useful to consider two levels of regional
prevalence and incidence for specific diseases; those
regions where the specific parasite is well established (i.e.,

endemic) and clinically recognised; and those regions
where sporadic autochthonous infections or cases
associated with travelling dogs have been reported.
Established endemic ranges
The established ranges for canine piroplasms are listed in
Table 1; comprehensive and up-to-date canine vector-borne
disease maps of Europe, and East and Southeast Asia are
available [25]. As would be expected, the geographical
distribution of these organisms is delineated largely by
the ecological ranges of their vector ticks. Interestingly
this generalisation seems not to apply to Babesia gibsoni,
whose rapid recent global dispersion is now proposed to
have been achieved predominantly by direct dog-to-dog
transmission under unique ownership and management
practices, without involvement of a vector (see later
discussion) [4,5].

Babesia vogeli is the most widespread canine piroplasm
due to the cosmopolitan nature of its host, the brown dog
tick Rhipicephalus sanguineus (Table 1). Babesia vogeli has a
truly worldwide distribution throughout tropical and
subtropical regions and extending into cooler latitudes
where it potentially occurs alongside (and may be
confused with) the other large Babesia spp. Babesia canis
(sensu strictu) is transmitted by Dermacentor spp. and has
been increasingly recognised throughout central Europe
when it was once thought to be confined to France.
Babesia rossi is the other African Babesia (with B. vogeli and
B. gibsoni); originally recognised only in South Africa but
has been reported recently in other regions of the African
continent including Nigeria [26] and Sudan [27] where its
vector ticks (Haemaphysalis spp.) are enzootic (Table 1).

Comments

Outside Asia this infection is
often associated with Pit Bull
Terriers and other fighting dogs

Molecular detection only

The small canine piroplasm with the greatest geographical distribution is undoubtedly B. gibsoni. The
type-species is referred to as the “Asia strain”, reflecting
its original molecular identification from a number of
different southern, eastern and southeastern Asian countries. However, in the last 10 years B. gibsoni infections
have been reported in many countries outside Asia, in
American Pit Bull Terrier-type dogs predominantly, and
there is now convincing evidence that these cases have
arisen due to biting and fighting between infected and
non-infected dogs [4,28]. Gene sequence conservation
has been noted in the ITS and 18S gene of B. gibsoni
isolates originating in many disparate regions of the
world [6,22,29]. This observation has led to the
intriguing hypothesis that the lack of genetic diversity in
B. gibsoni is a result of the absence of sexual reproduction
(sporogony) in the tick; in other words a clonal
expansion of a single strain is occurring within a
susceptible host population. Therefore the dogs themselves are the reservoir for B. gibsoni, specific fighting
dogs in particular, and not an endemic species of tick.
Due to the worldwide popularity of this and similar
breeds, it is speculated that Babesia gibsoni will be
reported eventually from all countries where (usually
illegal) dog fighting is practiced.
The three most recently characterised small piroplasm
species of dogs occur, as previously mentioned, in the
western United States, specifically California (Babesia
conradae), southern Africa (Theileria sp.) and the Iberian
peninsular (Theileria annae), where the latter is thought to
be transmitted by Ixodes hexagonus. The vectors for Babesia
conradae and the South African Theileria sp. are currently

Parasites & Vectors 2009, 2(Suppl 1):S4

unknown and apart from a single case report of Theileria
annae in the USA [28], these piroplasms have not been
reported outside these fairly localised geographical
boundaries.
Autochthonous infections and other single infection
reports
Autochthonous infection refers to discovery of an
infection that has originated in the place where it is
found, usually in the context of a new, or unexpected
finding in a location where the infection is generally not
considered to occur. In the case of babesiosis,
autochthonous cases are most likely to arise when dogs
have come into contact with infected vectors which may
themselves have been introduced by hosts returning from
vector-endemic areas, or by extension of the vector range
due to ecological changes. There have been a number of
reports of autochthonous babesiosis and piroplasmosis
in northern Europe (where vector-borne diseases have
been considered unusual or exotic) and such cases have
raised concern among the local veterinary and pet-owning
fraternities. The importance of collecting travel history as
an integral step during a veterinary consultation has been
emphasised, together with concern about the risks of
disease spread associated with deregulated pet travel,
particularly in mainland Europe and the UK. The history
of being a hunting dog or extensive rural exposure is a risk
factor for canine babesiosis in Europe [30].

Diagnosis of babesiosis
Microscopy remains the simplest and most accessible
diagnostic test for most veterinarians and during acute
infections microscopy is reasonably sensitive for detecting
intraerythrocytic parasites in Giemsa or Wright’s stained
blood smears. Differentiation between large and small
piroplasms is also relatively simple. Moreover, microscopy is still the only viable option available to
veterinarians in many parts of the developing world
where babesiosis is endemic. With large Babesia species at
least, sampling from capillary beds (ear tip, toe nail) or
examination of cells from beneath the buffy coat of a
haematocrit tube may improve the probability of finding
parasites [31,32].
The diagnosis of piroplasmosis in chronically infected
and carrier dogs however remains a significant challenge
due to very low, often intermittent parasitaemias. Failure
to detect Babesia/Theileria parasites in animals with hemolytic anaemia or thrombocytopenia has led to an incorrect
diagnosis in documented cases, often when the clinical
suspicion of babesiosis was also low. Given the possibility
of direct horizontal transmission of Babesia gibsoni,
veterinary clinicians should always ascertain whether the
patient has been bitten by any other dog in the preceding
4-8 weeks, irrespective of its breed [4,28].

Molecular diagnosis – conventional PCR and other
methods
Although PCR has greatly increased the sensitivity and
specificity of parasite detection and is well suited to
epidemiological and phylogenetic studies, access to
molecular techniques for routine clinical diagnosis of
babesiosis is still restricted to relatively few laboratories
worldwide. Ribosomal RNA genes 18S, 5.8S, 28S and the
internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences have been
used for conventional PCR, but some researchers have
chosen other loci such as the p18/BgTRAP [33]. Since
parasite morphology is a poor guide to speciation,
modifications of the PCR have been utilised to rapidly
differentiate between piroplasm species; PCR-RFLP and
nested PCR have been reported to differentiate B. vogeli
and B. gibsoni in Australia [34], and between the large
babesial species [9] and B. gibsoni in endemic regions
[35]. In a clinicopathological study of large Babesia spp.
infections in dogs in Italy using PCR-RFLP, Babesia canis
was detected in 34/164 and Babesia vogeli in 11/164 dogs.
Although a distinct geographical difference in the
incidence of these infections is noted [30], many of the
dogs with B. canis infection had recently returned from
hunting trips in Eastern Europe. Further refinement in
primer design was reported recently to clearly separate
amplicons of 342bp, 546bp, and 746bp target fragments
of B. canis rossi, B. canis vogeli, B. canis canis, respectively
[36]. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP)
was found to have advantages of speed and specificity for
detecting B. gibsoni infections in Japan [37] and reverseline blot (RLB) hybridisation was applied in epidemiological studies of arthropod-borne haemopathogens of
dogs and cats in Trinidad [38] and dogs in Africa [19].
Real-time PCR enables quantification of pathogen levels
within blood and tissue samples; the amount of final PCR
product can be used to deduce the starting number of
target molecules and infer parasite levels within a host.
Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used in an experimental
infection of 3 dogs with B. gibsoni that concluded that the
methodology might be adapted to the determination of
vaccine or chemotherapeutic efficacy, or the elucidation
of immunological responses [39]. Furthermore, a number
of these PCR methods have been applied to filter-paper
technologies such as FTA cards (Whatman Bioscience)
and IsoCode Stix (Schleicher and Scheull) for ease of
transport of samples to distant laboratories and for epidemiological and other diagnostic studies [34,40]. Longterm storage and archival qualities of this methodology
have not been investigated [40].

Whereas the detection limit of light microscopy is
approximately 0.001% parasitaemia, PCR is capable of
detecting parasite loads in the region of 50 organisms/ml
[35] and 9 parasites/μl [39]. Yet despite its extraordinary
sensitivity, PCR will clearly not detect target DNA when

Parasites & Vectors 2009, 2(Suppl 1):S4

there are no organisms within the sample. “False
negative” results may occur in chronic babesiosis and it is
very important to recognise this limitation when
screening potential carriers and other asymptomatic dogs
such as blood donors. The ability of PCR to detect
infected dogs in such situations, with and without
treatment, has been investigated [41,42]. In one study
[42] clinical parameters, haematology, serologic titer (by
IFAT) and the presence of Babesia DNA was monitored on
a daily basis after experimental infection. All dogs (n = 3)
made a full clinical recovery, as judged by normal clinical
signs, absence of splenic enlargement, a normal
haemogram and absence of piroplasms on microscopic
examination by 30-50 days after peak parasitaemia.
During this period of clinical normality, babesial DNA
was inconsistently detected. This suggests a very low,
fluctuating parasitaemia in these dogs, possibly analogous to chronic, asymptomatic natural infection.
The ability of PCR to detect parasite DNA in chronically
infected animals can be improved by testing on more
than one occasion, but the use of serology as an alternative, complementary diagnostic test is advisable in
these situations [42,43].
Serological testing – the IFAT and ELISA
Immunofluorescent antibody testing (IFAT) has been the
most widely supported serological diagnostic test for
canine babesiosis for the last 30 years [44,45]. However,
poor specificity due to cross-reactions between Babesia
spp. and with other apicomplexan parasites, operator
subjectivity and its inadequacy for large-scale screening
have all been limiting factors [46]. Recent research by
several groups in Japan directed towards finding specific
immunodominant Babesia gibsoni antigens for use in
recombinant protein enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assays (ELISA) – and potential vaccine candidates in the
future – has identified numerous promising compounds
[46-52]. Thrombospondin-related adhesive proteins
(TRAPs) comprise a group of highly conserved functional
proteins identified in apicomplexan parasites, mooted to
be associated with merozoite motility and invasion, and
capable of inducing a host antibody response [49]. An
ELISA using recombinant BgTRAP was reported to be
more sensitive than other ELISAs using recombinant
antigens rBgP50, rBgSA1, and rBgP32 [43], and Konishi et
al. (2008) utilised a BgTRAP ELISA to test 1,206 randomly
selected non-fighting breed dogs in Japan to test for
exposure to B. gibsoni [53]. These authors reported higher
infection rates in western Japan and concluded that
having excluded fighting dogs, a history of tick (Haemaphysalis longicornis) exposure was a significant risk factor
for anti-babesial antibody detection, thus demonstrating
two distinct epidemiological patterns of B. gibsoni
infection in that country.

http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/2/S1/S4

A second major limitation of serological tests is their
inability to differentiate acute from chronic infections,
and interpretation of a positive titre is somewhat
problematic for clinicians working in regions that are
endemic for babesiosis. Nevertheless, for B. gibsoni in the
USA and Australia, where cases are sporadic, the IFAT is a
useful tool for detection of infected dogs, especially if
combined with PCR [31,38].

Pathophysiology
The severity of babesiosis in dogs and cats ranges from
subclinical infection, the development of mild anaemia
to widespread organ failure and death. The critical
determinant of this variable pathogenesis is the piroplasm species, yet other factors such as the age and
immune status of the host and concurrent infections or
illness also play a role. All species (Table 1) may cause
pyrexia, anorexia, splenomegaly, anaemia and thrombocytopenia. Direct parasite-induced red-cell damage,
increased osmotic fragility of infected cells, oxidative and
secondary immune-mediated injury of the erythrocyte
membrane result in a combination of intravascular and
extravascular haemolysis.
The clinical features of babesiosis have been reviewed
elsewhere [1-3]. In broad terms it is generally agreed that
the least pathogenic of the well-recognised canine
piroplasm species is Babesia vogeli, at least in adult dogs,
and the most virulent is Babesia rossi in Africa [1,30,31].
With Babesia rossi infections a large proportion of dogs
develop complications, some of which (hepatopathy,
immune-mediated haemolysis) typically extend hospital
stay but do not affect mortality if treated appropriately,
while others (haemoconcentration, neurological signs,
acute renal failure and pulmonary oedema) require early,
aggressive and intensive therapy and carry a poor prognosis [32]. In contrast, Babesia vogeli is often subclinical
(except in puppies less than 3-4 months old, in which
infection may be fatal); it is occasionally observed in
blood films of dogs with other primary disease or
receiving medical treatment (e.g., immunosuppression or
chemotherapy) or surgery (notably splenectomy), and in
these potentially immunocompromised individuals the
appearance of the parasite may be inconsequential to the
outcome (and may not even warrant treatment).
The pathogenicity of Babesia canis, Babesia gibsoni,
Theileria annae and Babesia conradae is moderate to severe
in dogs, but it should be stressed again that a wide range
of clinical signs of varying severity can be observed in
individuals. Babesia conradae is considered to be more
pathogenic than B. gibsoni, resulting in higher parasitaemias and more severe anaemia [14]. In Spain, Theileria
annae infection is associated with severe haemolysis and
azotaemia [16]. The unnamed Babesia sp. from North

Page 5 of 9

Parasites & Vectors 2009, 2(Suppl 1):S4

Carolina has been associated with non-specific illness
(lethargy and anorexia), pigmenturia and mild fever,
predominantly in splenectomised dogs [54]. Laboratory
findings have included mild anaemia and severe thrombocytopenia, similar to Babesia vogeli infections [54].
The potential for renal involvement in dogs with
babesiosis has received attention in recent years, with
hypoxaemia, haemoglobinuric nephropathy and glomerulonephritis all considered possible mechanisms and
supported by histological studies [55]. A clinicopathological study of Theileria annae infection in Northwest
Spain reported 36% dogs (n = 58) were azotaemic at the
time of diagnosis and that these dogs had a 10-fold higher
risk of death from piroplasmosis than those that were not
azotaemic [56]. Unfortunately neither urine-specific
gravity nor urine osmolality was reported in these dogs,
but elevated urine protein: creatinine ratios, hypoalbuminaemia and hypercholesterolaemia in affected
dogs led the authors to suggest that glomerular injury was
occurring and that renal failure was most likely a feature
of Theileria annae infection [56]. In contrast, study of
azotaemia associated with B. rossi infection concluded
that urea and creatinine were unreliable indicators of
renal damage or acute renal failure in acute babesiosis
[57,58]. Mortality of B. rossi was significantly associated
with high cortisol and high ACTH concentrations and
with low T4 and fT4 concentrations in a recent study
investigating endocrine markers of disease [59].
The clinical consequences of chronic babesial infection
are unclear and while most dogs appear to tolerate this
state of premunity with few ill effects, theoretically they
remain at risk of developing immune-mediated complications and recrudescence of clinical disease (and parasitaemia) if immunocompromised at a later time. Chronic
infection may be inconsequential in some dogs and may
be even beneficial for hosts living in endemic regions by
protecting them from further disease [60].

Recent advances in the treatment and
prevention of babesiosis
Despite a plethora of anecdotal reports and uncontrolled
experimental data, there is a paucity of scientifically
robust evidence regarding the efficacy of drugs that have
been used to treat canine babesiosis over the last 100
years. Early treatment studies were hampered by the need
to rely on clinical signs and blood films to determine
parasite clearance. More recently the limitations have
been the cost of establishing controlled infections and the
relatively small numbers of experimental dogs permitted
by animal ethics committees. In order to determinate the
efficacy of an anti-piroplasm drug with reasonable
confidence, necropsy-obtained tissues from all organs
need to be tested by validated PCR at the end of the

http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/2/S1/S4

experiment; clearance of the parasite DNA from
peripheral blood alone is insufficient evidence of cure.
Imidocarb dipropionate and diminazine aceturate are
widely used anti-piroplasm drugs, but other compounds
that have been used for many years and have enjoyed
varying degrees of success in managing the clinical signs
of piroplasmosis include quinuronium sulphate, trypan
blue, pentamidine, phenamidine and parvaquone.
National registration authorities have restricted access to
some of these drugs in certain countries, and some,
notably the diamidine derivative diminazine, are associated with a high rate of toxic side effects. At best these
drugs result in amelioration of clinical signs; rarely do
they achieve true sterilisation of the infection.
The successful treatment of the small piroplasm infections, notably B. gibsoni, has been especially challenging.
Clindamycin at 25 mg/kg q12 h PO induced morphological changes and reduced the parasitaemia in an
experimental infection compared with untreated controls,
but did not eliminate the parasite, and piroplasms were
still observed in low numbers 108 days after infection
[61]. Recently, the apparent cure of B. gibsoni was reported
in 3 out of 4 experimental dogs that had not responded to
repeated diminazine treatment, with a combination of
clindamycin, metronidazole (15 mg/kg q12 h PO) and
doxycycline (5 mg/kg q12 h PO) [62]. Successful treatment in these dogs was determined by a combination of
normal clinical signs and the absence of B. gibsoni DNA in
peripheral blood. More recently, a combination of
azithromycin (10 mg/kg q24 h PO) and atovaquone
(13.3 mg/kg q8 h PO) for 10 days has been used for
treating B. gibsoni and appears to combine reasonable
clinical efficacy with great safety [41]; the expense of
atovaquone limits widespread acceptance of this therapy
where it is most needed, in Asia. Cheaper formulations of
atovaquone with proguanil cause an unacceptably high
incidence of gastrointestinal side effects in dogs. Unfortunately this drug combination also does not result in a
cure in some dogs, and rapid development of resistance to
atovaquone caused by mutation of the cytochrome b gene
has been reported [42,63].
In vitro studies of numerous rainforest plant extracts for their
antibabesial properties have been published recently
[64-66], but to date no clinical trials have been reported with
these compounds. A Haemaphysalis longicornis tick-derived
peptide reduced parasitaemias of B. microti in BALB/c mice
and directly kills B. gibsoni parasites in ticks [67].
Prevention of babesiosis, as with any tick-transmitted
disease, is best achieved by removing the possibility of
exposure to the vector. This is rarely achievable in
endemic areas despite attentive ectoparasite control.

Parasites & Vectors 2009, 2(Suppl 1):S4

Several drugs have been investigated for their prophylactic
potential against babesiosis, yet none has been
consistently reliable in this regard. Experimental studies
suggested that a single dose of imidocarb dipropionate
(6 mg/kg) protects dogs from B. canis challenge for up to
8 weeks [68] and that doxycycline at 5 mg/kg/day
ameliorates the severity of disease when challenged with
virulent B. canis [69].
In vitro culture-derived soluble parasite antigens (SPA)
have been used to protect dogs in European against B.
canis (sensu strictu) challenge in a commercially available
vaccine since the 1980s, and it was reported in one study
that the incidence of babesiosis decreased from 16% to
near zero in populations of vaccinated dogs living in
endemic regions over the three-year period of study
(reviewed in [70]). However, variable efficacy of the SPA
vaccine during homologous challenge has been attributed
to strain variation [71] and it was clear from early studies
that B. canis-derived SPA did not protect dogs from heterologous challenge with B. rossi [72], which led to the
development of a vaccine containing a mixture of SPA
from both European B. canis and South African B. rossi that
offered greater protection against heterologous challenge
[73]. Current research is also conducted in Japan in search
of suitable immunodominant and protective antigens for
use in vaccines against Babesia gibsoni [74].

Conclusions
Canine babesiosis/piroplasmosis remains as a significant
disease that despite considerable advances during the last
decade in our knowledge and understanding of the
pathogens themselves, the intricacies of transmission, and
their pathophysiological mechanisms, still poses significant diagnostic and therapeutics challenges for veterinary
practitioners around the world. New species of piroplasm
will almost certainly be described, and the geographical
range of established piroplasms will expand due to
international movements of dogs and expansion of vector
tick habitats. The challenges for the researchers are to
provide practitioners with readily accessible and accurate
diagnostic tools, safer and more efficacious anti-babesial
drugs, and the “Holy Grail” of this applied research –
effective immunologicals for the prevention or, at least,
amelioration of the clinical signs of canine babesiosis.
