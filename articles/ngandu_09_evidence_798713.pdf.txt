Abstract
Background: The cytotoxic T-lymphocyte immune response is important in controlling HIV-1
replication in infected humans. In this immune pathway, viral peptides within infected cells are
presented to T-lymphocytes by the polymorphic human leukocyte antigens (HLA). HLA alleles
exert selective pressure on the peptide regions and immune escape mutations that occur at some
of the targeted sites can enable the virus to adapt to the infected host. The pattern of ongoing
immune escape and reversion associated with several human HLA alleles has been studied
extensively. Such mutations revert upon transmission to a host without the HLA allele because the
escape mutation incurs a fitness cost. However, to-date there has been little attempt to study
permanent loss of CTL epitopes due to escape mutations without an effect on fitness.
Results: Here, we set out to determine the extent of adaptation of HIV-1 to three wellcharacterized HLA alleles during the initial exposure of the virus to the human cytotoxic immune
responses following transmission from chimpanzee. We generated a chimpanzee consensus
sequence to approximate the virus sequence that was initially transmitted to the human host and
used a method based on peptide binding affinity to HLA crystal structures to predict peptides that
were potentially targeted by the HLA alleles on this sequence. Next, we used codon-based
phylogenetic models to quantify the average selective pressure that acted on these regions during
the period immediately following the zoonosis event, corresponding to the branch of the
phylogenetic tree leading to the common ancestor of all of the HIV-1 sequences. Evidence for
adaptive evolution during this period was observed at regions recognised by HLA A*6801 and
A*0201, both of which are common in African populations. No evidence of adaptive evolution was
observed at sites targeted by HLA-B*2705, which is a rare allele in African populations.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that the ancestral HIV-1 virus experienced a period of positive
selective pressure due to immune responses associated with HLA alleles that were common in the
infected human population. We propose that this resulted in permanent escape from immune
responses targeting unconstrained regions of the virus.

Background
Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) originated from simian
immunodeficiency virus infecting chimpanzees (SIVcpz)
through a chimpanzee-to-human zoonotic transmission
[1-4]. Until recently [5], the natural hosts of the virus, the
chimpanzee, have been thought to remain asymptomatic
throughout infection despite high viral loads [6-8] In
humans, however, an increase in viral load is usually associated with progression to the acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and subsequently death [9-13].
The causes of the difference in disease progression may
involve either differences in the host and/or between the
HIV-1 and the SIVcpz viruses.
A zoonotic (i.e. cross-species) event is expected to be
accompanied by mutations that enable the pathogen to
adapt to the new host environment, (e.g. as observed in a
study by Baric et al [14]). Indeed, sequence changes have
been identified in HIV-1 that are evidence of selective
pressure associated with the genetics of the human host
[15-17]. In particular, the human cytotoxic T-lymphocyte
(CTL) immune response directed against foreign antigens
plays a major role in exerting selective pressure on antigenic proteins, including those of HIV-1. The activation
and characteristics of the immune responses against the
virus have been found to differ remarkably between
human and chimpanzee [7,18-20]: an elevated anti-HIV
immune response upon infection is characteristic in
humans, but the chimpanzee generally maintains a low
level of immune activation. The human immune response
may therefore exert higher selective pressure on the virus
sequence compared to immune responses of the natural
host. However, the virus is capable of overcoming the
immune response, leading to AIDS.
The CTL immune response is mediated by Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) molecules that bind to endogenous
antigenic peptides known as epitopes, and transport them
to the surface of the infected cell for recognition by CTLs
resulting in killing of the infected cell [21]. The HLA gene
is highly polymorphic and each HLA molecule binds to
peptides that contain specific sequence motif patterns
(known as anchor residue motifs) [22,23]. For binding to
occur between a peptide and the HLA binding groove,
only limited amino acid variation at the main anchor
positions of the peptide is allowed [21,24,25]. Successful
binding, efficient transport and presentation of a peptide
to a CTL depend on the presence of the appropriate
anchor residue motif and the overall affinity between the
HLA binding groove and the epitope [26,27]. The strength
of selective pressure varies between specific CTL immune
responses directed by different HLA alleles [28]. Some
HLA molecules have been associated with immune escape

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/164

mutations at anchor sites which enable the virus to adapt
to the host, thus increasing viral load [8,29-31].
Investigation of the evolutionary dynamics of immune
escape has focussed primarily on escape mutations that
incur a fitness cost and consequently revert to wild type,
upon transmission to a host that mounts different
immune responses. This can result in a pattern of toggling
between escape and wild-type amino acids that is detectable using evolutionary modelling [32]. In this study the
focus is on escape mutations that do not incur a cost in
terms of viral fitness. Such escape mutations do not experience selection pressure to revert to the wild-type state
following transmission to a new host. Consequently, they
are associated with episodic selection, rather than the
ongoing rapid evolution associated with escape and reversion. Upon transmission to human, SIV is likely to have
experienced selective pressure to escape from common
human immune responses. Some of these escape mutations would not have had a significant effect on the fitness
of the virus and thus would not have experienced strong
selection to revert. Consequently, we hypothesized that
the branch of the SIV-HIV-1 phylogenetic tree leading to
the ancestor of the HIV-1 sequences would include evidence of episodic selection to escape from common HLA
alleles.
To investigate the evidence of episodic selection for CTL
escape along this branch, we predicted epitopes for HLA
alleles, using the SIV consensus sequence to approximate
the sequence that was transmitted to humans. We used a
structure-based method that estimates the strength of
binding between a viral amino acid sequence and an HLA
molecule from amino acid pair-wise potentials for the
epitope prediction. We selected regions where known
anchor residue motifs were present and which had high
binding affinity, limiting our analysis of selective pressure
to these regions. Finally, we used models of codon
sequence evolution to quantify the selective pressure,
inferring positive selection from the ratio of nonsynonymous substitution rates (dN) to synonymous substitution
rates (dS) for individual branches in a phylogeny. Branchspecific analysis of selective pressure enabled us to investigate selective pressure along the branch ancestral to the
HIV sequences, and hence to study how HIV-1 adapted to
the human host upon transmission from chimpanzee.

Methods
Sequence data
We downloaded an alignment of HIV-1 group M reference
genome sequences and chimpanzee sequences from the
Los Alamos database [33]. Previously, we found that some
synonymous sites of the nucleotide sequence are highly
conserved due to purifying selective pressure acting upon
them, and that such conservation of synonymous sites can

cause errors in the prediction of positive selection [34].
Therefore, in this study we removed the conserved regions
identified in that study from the alignment (see Additional File 1). The resulting alignment consisted of 9
chimpanzee sequences and 32 HIV-1 sequences starting
from codon 1 of the gag gene and ending with the nef stop
codon, but excluding regions listed in Additional File 1.
We used HyPhy [35] to build a phylogenetic tree (Figure
1) from the alignment using a neighbour joining method
and the pairwise distances calculated using maximum
likelihood.
Predicting HLA binding regions
We used PREDEP [36], a structure-based method for predicting HLA binding peptides to determine potential
binding regions across the genome. We used the consensus chimpanzee sequence to predict the best HLA binding
regions because it has not been exposed to selective pressure resulting from human HLA and approximates the
sequence that was transmitted to human. Consequently, it
may be possible to detect epitopes in the chimpanzee
sequence that were eliminated from HIV-1 shortly after
transmission to humans. PREDEP does not require
knowledge of known HLA-binding peptides. The program
requires solved crystal structures of the HLA molecules as
well as knowledge of amino acid residues on the HLA
binding groove that interact with each position of the
antigenic peptide sequence. Amino acid pair-wise potentials between the peptide and the amino acids in the HLA
binding groove are calculated based on backbone and
side-chain interactions.

A score for each HLA-peptide interaction is calculated as
the sum of amino acid pair-wise potentials between each
peptide residue and the interacting residues of the HLA
binding groove. The lower the score, the better the peptide
binds to the HLA binding groove, i.e., the higher the binding affinity. Peptides with strong binding affinities to the
HLA molecule are most likely to be successfully presented
to CTLs in-vivo. A test of PREDEP performance showed
that 80% of the top 15 percentile best binders were known
optimal HLA binding peptides [36]. In this study, we
determined the binding energy of all possible peptides
across the SIVcpz consensus sequence to each of the six
HLA alleles with known crystal structures available in
PREDEP. For each available HLA allele, we first selected
peptide regions that had binding scores in the best 5% (a
conservative threshold chosen to ensure minimal false
positives) of those obtained across the chimpanzee
sequence for that particular HLA allele. Next, we discarded
regions that did not contain the amino acid residues
known to give optimal binding at the major binding
pockets, i.e. peptides that matched the anchor residue
motifs of the HLA allele. For each HLA allele, we generated a new alignment consisting of only the sites in the

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/164

potential binding regions identified for that allele for further analysis.
Analysis of Selective pressure along the HIV-1 ancestral
branch
We used the BranchAPriori [37] and GABranch [38] algorithms implemented in HyPhy [35] to analyse branchspecific selective pressure exerted by each HLA allele. We
were specifically interested in selective pressure along the
SIVcpz branch ancestral to the HIV-1 sequences (labelled
'B' in Figure 1, and referred to below as the HIV ancestral
branch), because we expect that this reflects the evolution
of the virus around the time of transmission from chimpanzees to human. We therefore investigated whether
there is higher selective pressure on this branch at sites
that are potential targets for each HLA allele under study.
These two approaches calculate the average selective pressure acting upon all regions potentially targeted by an
HLA allele, thus combining evidence from multiple sites.
We expect that this should result in more powerful tests
than can be obtained via site-specific analysis.
The BranchAPriori analysis
For each HLA-related alignment described in the previous
section, we compared the selective pressure along the HIV
ancestral branch to the rest of the branches in the tree
using the BranchAPriori algotithm. The program outputs
a p-value derived from the difference in the log likelihood
between the null and the alternative models. The null
model assumes a single global dN/dS ratio (Ï) across the
tree; in the alternative model, Ï is allowed to have a different value for the HIV ancestral branch.

The a priori analysis has the disadvantage of assuming that
all the branches in the rest of the tree are under uniform
selective pressure. This could result in the analysis having
reduced power, for instance when there is strong amongbranch heterogeneity of selective pressure in the rest of the
tree [39].
The GABranch analysis
In order to construct a more realistic null model, we therefore considered models that allow selective pressure to
vary across all branches of the tree. We used GABranch
[38], a genetic algorithm implemented in HyPhy, to infer
branch-specific selective pressure across the entire phylogeny of SIV and HIV-1 sequences and determine, for each
of the potential HLA binding regions, whether it evolved
under positive selection in the HIV ancestral branch.

As input, the GABranch analysis requires an underlying
nucleotide model - we determined the best fitting nucleotide model using a maximum likelihood-based tool
available in HyPhy [35]. GABranch then searches through
a range of possible codon models with varying dN/dS rate

classes, starting with a single rate model, i.e. a model that
assumes uniform selection across all the branches of the
tree. It tests models with more than one rate class, with the
evolutionary rate of each branch being assigned to the
best fitting rate class. An Akaike Information Criterion
(AIC) value is calculated for each model, based on its fit
to the data compared to the single rate model. The model
with the best fit to the data, as indicated by the lowest AIC
score, is selected and each branch is assigned to a dN/dS
rate class (indicated on the phylogeny in figures 2, 3 and
4). Additionally, GABranch provides the proportion of
tested models that show support for dN > dS for each
branch.

Results
Prediction of HLA binding regions in the chimp sequence
Only six HLA alleles with solved crystal structures (given
in Table 1) were available for analysis within the PREDEP
program. Of these six, only HLAs A*0201, A*6801 and
B*2705 showed strong binding to regions of the SIVcpz
consensus sequence, that is, regions with scores that were
within the top five percentile and also contained the preferred anchor residue motifs. The total length of the overlapping peptide regions predicted to be the best binders
for each HLA molecule across the chimp genome are given
in Table 2.
BranchAPriori analysis of differential selection between
the HIV and SIV lineages
We used the BranchAPriori analysis [39] to test, in the predicted binding region for each HLA allele, for evidence of
differential selective pressure between the HIV ancestral
lineage and the rest of the tree branches. For HLA A*0201
and HLA A*6801, the nonsynonymous-synonymous rate
ratio Ï was higher in the HIV ancestral branch than in the
rest of the tree (Table 3). The difference was significant
only for HLA A*6801, with a Ï of 3.5 in the HIV ancestral
branch and 1.6 in the rest of the tree (p value = 0.04).
Selective pressure acting along the HIV ancestral branch
for sites associated with A*0201 (Ï = 2.5) was also high,
but failed to differ significantly from the rest of the tree (Ï
= 1.2, p value = 0.08). For sites associated with B*2705
there was no significant difference between the HIV ancestral branch and the rest of the tree, with no indication of
strong selective pressure in either case (Ï = 1.0 in the HIV
ancestral branch and 1.1 in the rest of the tree, p value =
0.65).
Branch-by-branch analysis of selective pressure using the
GABranch algorithm
We ran the GABranch analysis on the sequence alignments of predicted binding regions from each HLA allele.
The Ï rate categories for the best fitting model as well as
the number of branches assigned to each rate category are
given in Table 4. Also shown, are the model-averaged val-

ues obtained for Ï and estimated probabilities that Ï>1
on the HIV ancestral branch. The proportion of models
that have support for dN>dS for each branch is given in
Figures 2, 3 and 4. The mean omega values and model
support data for all 79 branches of the three trees are given
in Additional files 2 (A*0201), 3 (A*6801) and 4
(B*2705). The tree in Figure 1 was made from the HIV
and SIV full length sequences before selecting binding
regions for each HLA allele, while those of Figures 2, 3 and
4 were generated from the screened alignments of binding
regions for individual HLA alleles. We therefore do not
expect these trees to have exactly the same topology.
For HLA A*6801 (Figure 3), positive selective pressure
was inferred along the HIV ancestral branch (Ï = 1.15). A
very high proportion of the tested models (0.996) supported dN>dS along this branch. We also found positive
selective pressure along the HIV ancestral branch for HLA
A*0201 (Ï = 1.14, Figure 2) and again 0.996 of models
supported for dN>dS. The best fitting model for the HLA
B*2705 predicted binding sites had only a single rate class
under weak purifying selection, and support for dN>dS
was not obtained on any branch of the phylogeny (Figure
4). These results are consistent with those of the BranchAPriori analysis and suggest that HLA A*0201 and HLA
A*6801 exerted positive selective pressure on the HIV-1
sequence in the period immediately following zoonosis,
whereas HLA B*2705 did not exert strong selective pressure on the HIV-1 sequence at any point in the phylogeny.

Discussion
The PREDEP program provides binding predictions for a
limited number of HLA molecules with solved crystal
structures and preferred binding anchor residue motifs
that were predicted from HLA-peptide structural conformations. Only six such HLA alleles known to mediate
cytotoxic T-lymphocyte immune responses are available
for analysis. Amongst these, we only observed HLAs
A*0201, A*6801 and B*2705 to bind strongly to some
regions of the consensus SIVcpz genome. Our analysis was
therefore restricted to selective pressure potentially
exerted by each of these three alleles following the chimpanzee-to-human zoonosis event of HIV.
It is interesting that neither the a priori nor the GABranch
analysis found evidence for positive selection in the HLA
B*2705 alignment, whether along the ancestral HIV-1
branch or any other branch. This is surprising because B27
alleles have been associated with delayed progression to
AIDS in HIV-1 infected individuals [40], which in turn is
associated with persistent strong positive selection at specific sites [41]. Also, delayed progression is a result of
reduced viral replication - this indicates that these sites are
important for the fitness of the virus. One possibility that
could explain the observed HLA B*2705 result is that it

HLA alleles with solved crystal structures that are available for

in [42].

may have caused positive selection on only a few sites.
Such selection is hard to detect because Ï is averaged over
all sites of the sequence. Selection may also have been
weak due to the fact that this is a rare HLA allele (1%)
[42].
In the HLA A*0201 dataset, both the a priori and the
GABranch analyses inferred positive selection on the HIV1 ancestral branch, with very high support for dN>dS. Of
the alleles available for analysis in this study, HLA A*0201
is the most frequent in African populations (see Table 1).
It is also the most frequent HLA allele in Caucasian populations and many studies have been carried out to determine its effect on HIV disease progression [42]. Even
though the allele recognizes immunodominant peptide
regions of the HIV-1 sequence, it fails to exert strong selective pressure on some virus peptides [43]. Some studies
have also shown that the outcome of an immune
response does not only depend on the HLA molecule but
also on the specific peptide sequences that are targeted
[44-48]. Our results suggest that immune escape mutations that occurred for HLA A*0201 mediated CTL
responses may have been selected for in the period immediately following zoonosis. If these adaptations subse-

quently became fixed in the viral population they would
no longer be under diversifying selection today.
HLA A*6801 (another common allele in African populations) appears to have exerted strong selective pressure on
the HIV-1 ancestral branch compared to the rest of the
tree. High support (99.6% of the tested models) for Ï > 1
was observed at the ancestral HIV branch. This allele has
anchor residue motif restrictions that are shared within
the HLA A3 supertype, the second most frequent supertype in the human population [49]. The HLA A*6801
allele itself targets the Tat protein, which is expressed in
the early stages of the HIV-1 lifecycle, and CTL responses
to this protein cause a significant reduction in disease progression rate [50]. Escape mutations from the CTL
immune response have also been identified within Tat at
the population level, causing reduced viral load [51,52].
The virus may have adapted well to the A*6801 responses
early after the cross-species transmission event at sites that
do not affect the replication of the virus. The recently
observed association with a reduction in viral load indicates that there were also functionally important sites contained in A*6801 epitopes - this would have made it
difficult for these regions to adapt to the immune
response.

Conclusion
This is the first study that analyses HLA-associated selective pressure following the transmission from chimpanzee
to human across all potential target sites of the HIV-1
genome. We identified regions of the HIV-1 sequence that
were initially targeted by the CTL immune response
immediately after the cross-species transmission of HIV-1
from chimpanzee to human using the chimpanzee consensus sequence. Of the six HLA alleles with crystal structures available for analysis, we found strong binding
regions; this could imply successful immune responses in
vivo, for HLAs A*0201, A*6801 and B*2705. We determined the average extent of selective pressure exerted by
each HLA allele along the branch leading to HIV-1
sequences. This branch represents the sequences that first
encountered human immune response-directed selective
pressure immediately following the zoonosis event. Our
results suggest that HIV-1 adapted to CTL responses

directed by HLAs A*6801 and A*0201, which are
amongst the most common HLA genotypes in African
populations (Table 1). It is therefore likely that the virus
was frequently exposed to selective pressure exerted by
common immune responses during initial exposure to the
human host following transmission of the virus from
chimpanzees. As observed from the results, we did not
find evidence for strong selective pressure exerted by the
HLA B*2705, which has extremely low frequencies in the
African populations (Table 1) [53,54].
In this study we focussed specifically on epitopes that we
infer were likely to have been present in the viral sequence
that first infected humans. We propose that the selection
we observe at these positions along the branch of the phylogenetic tree leading to all of the HIV-1 sequences reflects
episodic selection to evade human cytotoxic immune
responses. Episodic selection has been proposed to be an
important aspect of cross-species pathogen transmission
and, in fact, observed in a laboratory setting previously
[14]. However, this is the first time, to our knowledge, that
evidence has been presented of transient positive selection
associated with human immune responses against unconstrained regions of the virus shortly after transmission to
human.
