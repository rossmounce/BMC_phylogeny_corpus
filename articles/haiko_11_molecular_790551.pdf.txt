membrane protease towards plague virulence
factor Pla

Abstract
Background: Omptins are a family of outer membrane proteases that have spread by horizontal gene transfer in
Gram-negative bacteria that infect vertebrates or plants. Despite structural similarity, the molecular functions of
omptins differ in a manner that reflects the life style of their host bacteria. To simulate the molecular adaptation of
omptins, we applied site-specific mutagenesis to make Epo of the plant pathogenic Erwinia pyrifoliae exhibit
virulence-associated functions of its close homolog, the plasminogen activator Pla of Yersinia pestis. We addressed
three virulence-associated functions exhibited by Pla, i.e., proteolytic activation of plasminogen, proteolytic
degradation of serine protease inhibitors, and invasion into human cells.
Results: Pla and Epo expressed in Escherichia coli are both functional endopeptidases and cleave human serine
protease inhibitors, but Epo failed to activate plasminogen and to mediate invasion into a human endothelial-like
cell line. Swapping of ten amino acid residues at two surface loops of Pla and Epo introduced plasminogen
activation capacity in Epo and inactivated the function in Pla. We also compared the structure of Pla and the
modeled structure of Epo to analyze the structural variations that could rationalize the different proteolytic
activities. Epo-expressing bacteria managed to invade human cells only after all extramembranous residues that
differ between Pla and Epo and the first transmembrane b-strand had been changed.
Conclusions: We describe molecular adaptation of a protease from an environmental setting towards a virulence
factor detrimental for humans. Our results stress the evolvability of bacterial b-barrel surface structures and the
environment as a source of progenitor virulence molecules of human pathogens.

Background
Analyses of genomic sequences of bacterial pathogens
have given an unprecedented view into their biology and
evolutionary processes [1,2]. A conclusion from these
studies is that highly similar genes, many of which are
associated with bacterial virulence, are found across
great phylogenetic distances and in different genetic elements, which is indicative of horizontal gene transfer.
These families of virulence factors - including toxins,
transport systems, adhesins, and antibiotic resistance
factors - have evolved by adaptive radiation of a functional progenitor molecule to and within other strains
and species to support survival in differing ecological

niches [2]. The adaptation, or “evolutionary fine-tuning”
of virulence factors that results in increased fitness, can
involve modification of catalytic efficiency or substrate
specificity of an enzyme, or alteration of bacterial interactions with target cells [2]. The mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer and the functional diversity of
bacterial toxin families and protein transport systems
have been documented [2-4] but adaptive molecular
evolution of bacterial virulence factors remains less
understood in terms of altered structure/function
relationships.
Yersinia pestis is the causative agent of plague, a zoonotic disease transmitted to humans usually by the bite of
an infected flea [5]. The bacterium spreads from the
intradermal infection site into lymph nodes, causing
bubonic plague, and subsequently to blood and to lungs,
leading to pneumonic plague. The abilities to disseminate

in the host and to cause high bacteremia are central for
the transmission of the bacterium by the flea vector
which feeds on contaminated blood. Y. pestis has been
responsible for three human pandemics, which are estimated to have resulted in deaths of ca. 200 million
humans [5]. As a bacterial species Y. pestis is young, and
recent population genetic studies have shown that the
bacterium diverged from its ancestral species, the gastrointestinal pathogen Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, only ca.
13 000 years ago [6,7]. The genome of Y. pestis has
evolved through gene decay, recombination, single
nucleotide changes, genome rearrangements, and horizontal gene transfer by acquisition of two Y. pestis-specific plasmids, of which the plasmid pPCP1 (pPst/pPla)
potentiates bacterial dissemination from the primary
intradermal infection site into lymph nodes [8,9]. The
decisive virulence factor encoded by pPCP1 is the surface
protease plasminogen activator Pla. Deletion of pla
attenuates Y. pestis millionfold in subcutaneously infected
mice, whereas no difference is seen in intravenously
infected mice [8]. Pla is specifically needed for establishment of bubonic plague [10,11], and a critical role of Pla
has been described in pneumonic plague where it enables
localized growth of Y. pestis in the lungs [12].
Pla belongs to an outer membrane protease family of
omptins that have been detected in several Gram-negative bacteria of different phylogenetic groups; these bacteria commonly infect animals or plants [13]. The
omptin genes have spread through horizontal gene transfer by different mechanisms, and at least 16 members are
known to date [13-16]. As omptin sequences are over
50% identical, they very likely fold similarly to the two
structurally resolved members of the family, OmpT of E.
coli [17] and Pla of Y. pestis [18]. Both OmpT and Pla
form a 70-Å long b-barrel of elliptical cross-section with
ten antiparallel transmembrane b-strands, five surfaceexposed loops (L1-L5) and four short periplasmic turns
(T1-T4). The catalytic residues and the acidic, substratebinding pocket, as well as the lipopolysaccharide-binding
site are conserved in omptins [13,17,19]. This is in accordance with the finding that the cleavage site preferences
of omptin proteolysis, analyzed mostly with short peptide
substrates, are very similar: omptins cleave after basic
residues, preferably between two basic amino acids
[20-23]. With larger substrates, however, omptins are
functionally diverse, and their genes have undergone
adaptive evolution to support the life style of the bacterial
host [14,15,24]. Insertions and deletions that give slight
variation in the molecular sizes of omptins are mostly
located in the solvent-accessible surface structures L1-L5,
and the differential substrate selectivities of individual
omptin proteases appear to be dictated by these surface
loops, as observed by loop swapping and omptin chimeras [16,19,25,26].

During infection, Pla seems to increase virulence
mainly by interfering with the human plasminogen/fibrinolytic system that is critical in cell migration across tissue barriers. Pla cleaves the circulating, abundant
zymogen plasminogen by a single cut to active plasmin
[8] and also degrades two natural inhibitors of the plasminogen system, the serpins a2-antiplasmin (a2AP) and
plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) [16,19]. Altogether, these activities result in uncontrolled plasmin
activity. Plasmin is a broad-substrate protease involved
in a number of (patho)physiological processes, of which
fibrinolysis and damage of extracellular matrices contribute to bacterial dissemination within the host
[12,27,28]. Pla has also non-proteolytic functions: it
mediates invasion of Y. pestis into human epithelial and
endothelial cells by an unknown mechanism as well as
into mouse monocytes by binding to CD205 [29-31].
The Epo omptin is a close homolog of Pla, exhibiting
77% sequence identity, and it is encoded on a plasmid
of the plant pathogen Erwinia pyrifoliae that causes tissue-destructive infection in pear trees [32]. The functions of Epo in plant pathogenesis have not been
systematically studied, but serpinolytic activity in vitro
was recently shown [16].
The claim of directed evolution and adaptive molecular evolution is that natural selection generates particularly evolvable enzymes in response to rapidly
fluctuating selective conditions and that proteins that
require fewest mutations to adapt to novel conditions
are the most likely to survive environmental changes
[33]. Evolvability has been argued to be a function of
robustness, i.e., the capacity of a protein to withstand
sequence variations without disruption of its binding or
catalytic properties [33,34]. Mutational robustness is
dependent on a protein’s intramolecular interactions,
and the omptin molecule fulfils the criteria of an evolvable protein as defined by O’Loughlin et al. [33]; the bbarrel is a sturdy membrane-embedded molecule with
flexible surface loops that can tolerate deletions and
insertions without compromising molecular stability
[35,36]. Manifestations of the robustness of omptins
include their unhurt catalytic activity after autocatalytic
cleavage at L4 and the proteolytic specificity of omptin
loop chimeras, which together have indicated that the
five loops offer a flexible scaffold for recognition of different substrates [16,19,25,26].
Evolutional studies on bacterial virulence factors highlight the importance of environment as an immense
reservoir of evolvable potential progenitors of virulence
factors [2]. Pla of Y. pestis and Epo of E. pyrifoliae belong
to the same subfamily of omptins which also contains the
omptins PgtE of Salmonella enterica, Kop of Klebsiella
pneumoniae, and the omptin of Enterobacter [15,16].
These bacterial species infect mammals or plants or both,

and have encountered mutual horizontal gene transfer. In
this study we used the existing knowledge of omptin
structure and function as a starting point for substitutional analysis, and addressed two specific questions on
molecular adaptation: how many substitutions are needed
and at which locations in Epo to gain a proteolytic function (plasminogen activation) and a non-proteolytic function (invasiveness) expressed by Pla.

Results
Substrate selectivity of Pla and Epo towards virulenceassociated human proteins

such as plasminogen activation by cleavage, or ii) directly
or indirectly enhance the virulence potential in vitro,
such as degradation of a2AP and PAI-1 and invasion to
the human endothelial-like cell line. Mature Pla sequence
differs from Epo by 65 amino acids, of which 31 are in
protein regions located outward the outer membrane
lipid bilayer. Of these 31 differences, 18 are located in the
surface loops L1-L5 (Figure 1). For these assays, we
expressed pla and epo in a well-defined laboratory host
strain E. coli XL1 to avoid background problems with
other virulence characteristics of Y. pestis and E. pyrifoliae, which either have been shown to or might interfere
with the proteolytic activity of Pla or Epo [37-39].
A clear functional difference between Pla and Epo was
observed in plasminogen activation: Pla activated

plasminogen efficiently but Epo very poorly during a 3-h
cumulative measurement (Figure 2A). We next analyzed
plasminogen degradation by Pla and Epo using Western
blotting with two different antibodies: i) polyclonal antihuman plasminogen antibody that mainly detects the
charged kringle domains in the heavy chain of plasmin,
and ii) monoclonal anti-human plasminogen antibody
that recognizes the catalytic domain in the light chain of
plasmin (Figure 2B). Epo expressed by E. coli XL1
(pMRK4) degraded plasminogen but significantly more
slowly than did Pla expressed in the same host strain in
a 2-h incubation with plasminogen (Figure 2B). Further,
Epo did not form detectable light chain of plasmin in a
3-h incubation with plasminogen, which however was

discernible with the Pla-expressing bacteria (Figure 2B).
We have recently reported that Epo and Pla degrade the
serpin PAI-1 [16], and recombinant E. coli with Pla or
Epo also cleaved another serpin, a 2 AP (Figure 2C).
Thus, both omptins exhibited similar serpinolytic activity but differed in plasmin formation.
Construction of Pla-Epo hybrid proteins

In order to define the structural differences between Pla
and Epo that govern the Pla-like plasminogen activation,
we analyzed the sequence differences of Pla and Epo,
especially at the surface accessible regions which are
important for polypeptide substrate selectivity of omptins (see Figure 1) [19,25]. We generated Pla-Epo hybrid
proteins by swapping amino acid residues in the loop
regions differing between Pla and Epo sequences, and
then expressed the proteins in E. coli XL1. We initially
selected the residues to be substituted on the basis of
their clustering and location at the loops or on the
extracellular side on the protein. Our approach was to
create cumulative substitutions, first at those loop
regions where the most striking amino acid differences
between Pla and Epo are, and then at the amino acids
located on the extracellular side of the protein above
the lipid bilayer. Initially, the substitutions and analyses
were made in two directions: positive alteration from
Epo towards Pla (i.e., gain of function) and negative
alteration from Pla towards Epo (i.e., loss of function).
The nomenclature of the hybrid-expressing plasmids is
as follows: the first number tells the origin (1 for Pla, 4
for Epo), the next two numbers tell the number of substitutions made in the mature protein, and the possible
change of b strands is then given (see Table 1). E.g.,
pMRK431 denotes the Epo-based hybrid with 31 amino
acid substitutions towards Pla and pMRK431b2 a hybrid
additionally substituted for the b2 strand. The hybrid
proteins were expressed from the same high-copy plasmid in the same host strain; however, we also analyzed
their expression by Western blotting of whole cells and
of cell wall preparations using a cocktail of anti-Pla,
anti-Epo, and anti-Pla loop-specific sera (Figure 3).
These assays did not reveal substantial differences in the
protein expression levels that would explain, according
to our previous experience [19,37,39], the observed differences in plasminogen activation. The assay however
is semi-quantitative as the different hybrid proteins vary
in reactivity with the antibodies.
Plasminogen activation by Pla-Epo hybrid proteins

Cumulative plasminogen activation assays [19], where
the recombinant E. coli were incubated with plasminogen and the chromogenic plasmin substrate, were performed with Pla-Epo chimeras. The plasmid pMRK405
encodes the substitution of the loop 3 sequence

The reverse substitution in pla, encoded in plasmid
pMRK105, nearly completely abolished plasminogen
activation by recombinant E. coli (Figure 4B). We next
analyzed the effect of the further substitutions 260TI/KN

and 266ASLD/VSIG which are located at L5 in Epo and
encoded in pMRK410, and this hybrid protein was
nearly as effective as Pla in plasminogen activation

Y. pestis lineages (which have PlaT259) from the Pla isoform of the ancestral lineages (PlaI259). This substitution decreases Pla-mediated cleavage of plasmin light
chain that contains the catalytic domain, and thus
increases the stability of the formed plasmin [26]. An
increase in plasmin stability and formation of the plasmin light chain after the I259T substitution was also
observed in the series of Pla-Epo hybrid proteins in the
present study.
Structural analysis

proteins expressed in E. coli. (A) Pla-Epo hybrids with cumulative
substitutions towards Pla. (B) Pla-Epo hybrids with cumulative

(see Table 1). The data are average from two independent assays
with duplicate samples, and standard deviations are shown.

SNA/ETG at L1, 86QNS/MNE at L2 and 153SV/YT at
L3, only slightly improved plasminogen activation. The
reverse substitutions in pMRK117 gave a hybrid protein
that did not activate plasminogen at all. Thus, the substitution of 10 out of the 290 amino acids in the mature
Epo protein, located at L3 and L5, was enough to significantly alter its protease substrate selectivity towards
activation of human plasminogen.
The stepwise accumulation of substitutions onto the
Epo molecule was continued onwards from pMRK417
to pMRK431, where all 31 residues that differ between
Epo and Pla and that are located on the extracellular
side of the outer membrane on the protein have been
substituted towards Pla. These substitutions in Epo did
not change the cumulative plasminogen activation or
the fragmentation pattern of plasminogen (data not
shown). We recently reported that the single substitution I259T at loop 5 differentiates Pla of the pandemic

To gain physical insight into the observed functional differences in proteolysis, we studied the roles of the
swapped residues in the crystal structure of Pla [18] and
the homology model of Epo. The immediate environment
of the residues substituted in pMRKX10, where X is
either 1 or 4, is shown in Table 2 and Figure 5. The first
five substituted amino acids occur at the very end of the
long loop L3 and the following five are found at the tip of
L5 and in the early, solvent-accessible part of strand b10.
There are no direct contacts between 159 NQRPG/
KGVRV and 260TI/KN or 266ASLD/VSIG, but both the
L3 and the L5 residues interact with the intervening L4.
The b7-strand before L4 contains active site residues
D206 and H208, and is fully conserved between Epo and
Pla except for one residue (S210/D212; see Figure 1).
The five residues of the first substitution site are the
longest consecutive difference between Pla and Epo. In
the Pla structure, V163 at L3 packs together with apolar
residues P160 at L3 and M210 at L4 at the inside of the
barrel, while the L3 residues N159, Q160, and R161 in
Epo point towards the water phase (Figure 5). The distinct functional effect of pMRK405 substitutions could

well reflect changes in size of the binding pocket and
differences in the electrostatic properties of the substrate
docking surface.
The incremental substitutions of pMRK410 occur in
L5. K262 and N263 are located in the very tip of L5, and
in the Pla structure, both residues are in contact with L4.
Most intriguingly, N263 forms a hydrogen bond with
Pla-specific D212 in L4. Such an interaction is not possible between the corresponding residues in Epo, S210 and
I261. Moreover, K262 of Pla points towards E207 in b7.
This glutamate, and the threonine and the tyrosine
hydrogen-bonded to it are identical in Pla and Epo, but
the polar triplet at the outside of the barrel gets extended
and strengthened in Pla by K262 (L5) from one side and
by R164 (L3) from the other (Figure 5). The corresponding Epo-residues T260 and P162 are decisively smaller,
and do not reach to the L4 residues. pMRK410 construct
also includes swapping of 268VSIG/266ASLD in L5. These
residues lie in a small b-structure [18], supposedly in the
aqueous phase above the lipopolysaccharide layer. The
residues in both proteins form similar interactions with
their neighbors in same loop, except the Epo-specific
D269 that in the model hydrogen bonds to a backbone
carbonyl in the b1-strand. The end of loop L5 and the
beginning of L1 are rather irregular; both areas differ
between Pla and Epo, and a side chain-backbone hydrogen bond would stabilize the loops relative to each other.
In the Pla structure, L1 residues D33-R38 form a network
of hydrogen bonds.
Serpinolytic activity of Pla-Epo hybrids

To study the effect of structural changes on degradation
of another substrate, we next analyzed the degradation

of PAI-1 and a2 AP by the Pla-Epo chimeras. Pla and
Epo degraded PAI-1 and a 2 AP in a similar manner
(Figure 6). Recombinant E. coli strains (pMRK405),
(pMRK410), and (pMRK417) cleaved PAI-1 and a2AP
more efficiently than did E. coli with Pla or Epo (Figure
6). On the other hand, the hybrids with further substitutions, encoded in plasmids pMRK431 and pMRK431b1,
caused slower degradation of both PAI-1 and a 2 AP,
similar to that seen with Pla and Epo. The Pla-derived
hybrid proteins, encoded by plasmids pMRK105,
pMRK110, and pMRK117, were severely decreased in
their serpinolytic activity compared to both Pla and Epo.

Thus, serpinolytic activity and plasminogen activation
seem to require different amino acids in the omptins.
Turning Epo into an invasin

Invasiveness of Y. pestis into human epithelial and
endothelial cells is a putative virulence-associated property
of Pla [29,30], which was detected in a gentamicin protection assay with E. coli (pMRK1) expressing Pla but not
with E. coli (pMRK4) expressing Epo (Table 3). To compare gain of invasiveness to gain of plasminogen activation, we tested the Pla-Epo chimeras for their effect on
invasion into the ECV304 cell line. E. coli expressing chimeras up to pMRK417 gave a modest increase in bacterial
invasiveness. Surprisingly, E. coli XL1 (pMRK431) also
showed only a low but clearly positive level of invasiveness,
indicating that substitution of all extramembranous residues differing between Pla and Epo, sufficient to gain Plalike plasminogen activation, was not enough to turn Epo
into an efficient invasin. Strikingly, further substitutions in
the transmembrane region of Epo in pMRK431b1 (expressing all 31 Pla-specific residues located above the membrane and the remaining five residues, F14, T15, A18, T20,
and M22, from the N-terminal b1-strand and the irregular
region before the b1-strand) induced invasiveness to the
level seen with E. coli (pMRK1) expressing Pla. The hybrid
encoded in pMRK431b1 was similar to pMRK431 in
enhancing plasminogen activation by E. coli (data not
shown). Fusion of the same 5’ pla DNA (thus including
the b1-strand and the L1) into epo or the hybrids
pMRK410 or pMRK417 did not induce similar invasiveness (Table 3), indicating that the Pla-like omptin surface

is needed and the amino terminus alone does not potentiate invasion. Further, substitution of the other b-strands
to pMRK431 construct did not influence invasiveness
(Table 3). We substituted in pMRK431 the b strands 2, 4,
5, 8 and 9 together, and 10, that vary most in the b-strand
sequences of Pla and Epo.

Discussion
Erwinia species and Y. pestis colonize different habitats
and have a very different pathogenic potential for
humans. Bacterial virulence is normally dependent on
several factors, and presence of Pla, although it is an
exceptionally multifunctional and powerful virulence
factor [8,10-12,16,19,26-28,30,31] does not alone explain
the devastating virulence of Y. pestis. Our study however
gives an example of how a single, specific virulence factor of the plague bacterium might have structurally
adapted to its present form. Our results do not give a
direct roadmap to the Pla molecular structure but rather
describe how easily the substrate specificity of an omptin can evolve and how functions that are pathogenic in
a novel environment can be gained. The role of surface
loops in Pla proteolysis has earlier been documented by
loop swapping [16,26], and our results extend these
findings by a more detailed substitutional analysis and
by also conferring invasiveness onto a close ortholog of
Pla.
Serpins are important regulators of cellular proteolysis
and share structural features, which include a similar,
exposed reactive center loop that binds to and inhibits
the catalytic center of target proteases [40]. The omptins
in the Pla subfamily all cleave specifically the reactive
center loop of the PAI-1 [16]. Here we found that Epo
can cleave the serpin a2AP, which is a shared target of
Pla and PgtE [19,41]. These findings indicate that serpinolytic activity is a common function in the Pla subfamily of omptins and might give selection advantage for
survival and spread of bacteria in their hosts by increasing proteolysis in tissues. In contrast, omptins of the
OmpT subfamily, OmpT of E. coli and SopA of Shigella,
do not cleave PAI-1, despite high sequence similarity,
conserved fold and active site structure [16]. It is interesting to note that the Pla-Epo hybrid proteins encoded
in pMRK405, pMRK410, and pMRK417 were more efficient than Pla or Epo in PAI-1 degradation. Also,
further substitution towards Pla, encoded in pMRK431
and pMRK431b1, led to hybrid proteins that exhibited
an activity similar to that of Pla and Epo. Acquisition of
novel substrate specificities by proteases often leads to
broad-specificity variants by initially favoring mutations
that increase the conformational flexibility and destabilize specialized active site structures. thus reducing specificity for the original targets [33]. The observation that
intermediate Pla-Epo hybrid proteins were more

Haiko et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:43
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/43

efficient in PAI-1 degradation is in line with the
assumption that serpinolytic activity is a property of a
progenitor omptin in this subfamily and that Pla and
Epo have diverged from this progenitor to have novel
functions. The structural explanation for the increased
efficiency is however unknown. The activating cleavage
in plasminogen occurs between the R-V bond, while in
PAI-1 and probably also in a 2 AP the cleavage occurs
between R-M in the reactive center loop. Specialization
to plasminogen cleavage by Pla seems to correlate with
several stabilizing interactions between the surface
loops, formed by Pla-specific residues.
A molecular explanation for the altered plasminogen
activation encoded by pMRK410 remains speculative
without more specific molecular data about omptintarget complexes, and more generally, because the
in vivo mobility of the surface structures of the omptin
barrel. Still, the structural analysis presented here suggests a possible explanation. Most importantly, we see
multiple loop-loop interactions involving Pla-specific
residues. These would result in reduced loop flexibility
and a better defined binding pocket, promoting productive substrate binding. Second, we see a binding pocket
altered in size and hydrophobicity. The pMRKX05
(where X is either 1 or 4) substitutions 161 KGVRV/
NQRPG occur at one long end of the elliptical barrel
opening, and the 268 VSIG/ASLD at the other. This
seems to imply that the polypeptide substrates bind
across the long axis of the omptin pore, and the
pMRKX10 mutations change the docking surface. Altogether, the Pla structure seems to allow close approach
by the substrate, and the active site to be well stabilized
by interloop interactions. Assuming this is the reason
for the observed differences in plasminogen cleavage
versus serpinolysis, it means that plasminogen binding
and cleavage require a “preformed”, tighter binding
pocket.
The protein sites identified in this study enable the
omptin to initiate activating cleavage of plasminogen
but further substitutions are needed to stabilize plasmin.
Swapping of loops between Pla and PgtE of S. enterica
has revealed that L5 and the N-terminal region including L1 are crucial for the gelatinase activity by PgtE
[25]. The same regions and in addition L3 seem to be
important in the activation of pro-matrix metalloproteinase 9 by PgtE [25]. A residue deserving special attention is T259 of Pla, which is situated in L5 and faces
into the barrel opening next to F215. We recently
described that a single substitution at this site, T259I
that is typical for ancestral Y. pestis lineages, increases
the cleavage of the light chain of plasmin, thus decreasing the stability of the formed plasmin [26]. The conservation of this mutation in pandemic isolates indicates
that pla, after being acquired by Y. pestis, has evolved

Page 9 of 12

through a single nucleotide change to better support
plasmin formation. The pPCP1 plasmid also encodes
pesticin and pesticin immunity protein and is evolutionary related to colicin plasmids, in particular pColE1[42].
It is possible that the pPCP1 plasmid has evolved
through fusion of a pla progenitor gene and a ColE1like plasmid.
The omptins autoprocess themselves at different protein sites [15]. Formation of b-Pla-like peptide by Epo
hybrid proteins was detected by E. coli expressing
pMRK431 that encodes the substitution of all 31 differences between Pla and Epo at their surface-exposed
parts. This indicates that autoprocessing is dependent
on surface loops. Unexpectedly, these substitutions only
slightly improved the invasiveness of recombinant
E. coli. This indicates that the proteolysis and the invasiveness involve different regions of the omptin molecule and that the invasiveness, which among omptins
has been detected only with Pla [15], is a more complex
function than the proteolytic specificity. The plasmid
pMRK431b1, constructed from pMRK431 to also
encode the amino terminal residues 1-45 containing the
b1-strand, induced similar level of invasiveness as seen
with E. coli pMRK1. However, Pla amino terminus alone
in Epo did not convert Epo to an invasin. At present we
do not have an explanation for the requirement of
transmembrane regions to induce invasion by Epo. Our
hypothesis was that this might indicate TonB-dependency in invasion. TonB functions in energy coupling
between the cytoplasmic and the outer membrane and
is important in transport functions across the bacterial
cell wall [43]. The Pla and Epo sequences contain a
homolog to the TonB box [44] at the amino terminus
(11DSFTVAA in Pla and 9DSISVAT in Epo). A role for
TonB in Pla-mediated invasion however seems unlikely,
as expression of Pla or Epo in a tonB-deletion of E. coli
XL1 mutant did not alter their invasiveness (T. Lehti
and J. Haiko, unpublished). One possibility is that invasion requires membrane fusion which could differ
between Epo and Pla, as outer membrane b-barrels are
known to vary in their incorporation into different lipid
micelles [45]. It is also possible that changes in membrane-embedded residues have subtle effects on the
orientation and activity of surface residues that make
contact with the target cell. Finally, as a molecular event
invasion is complex and may require several steps
(adhesion, membrane fusion, host cell responses) that
involve more than one omptin protein region. This is in
line with the finding that extensive substitution was
required to induce invasiveness into Epo.

Conclusions
The omptin b-barrel fold has spread through horizontal
gene transfer in Gram-negative bacteria, and their

Haiko et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:43
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/43

pathogenetic functions and potential vary significantly
and correlate well with the pathogenetic mechanisms of
the host bacterial species. This implies that the omptins
have adapted and contribute to the life style of the bacteria, while they also have retained common functions
such as serpinolytic activity. Pla and plasminogen activation are central in plague pathogenesis, and among the
omptins, Pla is by far the most efficient plasminogen
activator while other omptins either cleave plasminogen
poorly or not at all [15,19,26]. Change of a few Epo
amino acids to those in Pla conferred a plague virulence
function on the omptin from a plant pathogen. The
mature sequences of Pla and Epo differ at 65 out of
292/290 residues, and we observed that the substitution
159
NQRPG/KGVRV at L3 alone caused a substantial
improvement in the plasminogen activation ability of
Epo when expressed in E. coli. Further substitutions
260
TI/KN and 266ASLD/VSIG at L5 improved the initial
plasminogen activation close to the level seen with Plaexpressing E. coli. Structural analysis indicated that differing residues at L3 and L5 in Pla and Epo interact
with L4 in different ways, leading to differences in the
substrate binding pocket. Substitutions at L3 and L5 did
not yet turn Epo into a Pla-like invasin, which required
more extensive substitutions both at the surface-exposed
part of the protein and the membrane-embedded Nterminal region, the b1-strand. Our findings are summarized in Figure 7.

Methods
Bacterial strains and plasmids

Bacterial strains and plasmids are listed in Table 1. pla
and epo were available from previous work [19,26]. Derivatives of pla and epo were cloned by recombinant twostep PCR as described earlier [19,25] and expressed in
the inducible pSE380 vector in E. coli XL1-Blue MRF as
described earlier [19,37]. The nucleotide sequences were
confirmed by sequencing. The recombinant E. coli
strains were cultivated overnight at 37°C in Luria broth
(10 ml) supplemented with glucose (0.2% wt/vol), ampicillin (100 μg/ml), and tetracycline (12.5 μg/ml). For
protein expression, the culture was pelleted, suspended
in 150 μl of phosphate- buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.1),
and plated on Luria plates containing 5 μM isopropyl-bD-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and antibiotics as
described above. For the assays, bacteria were collected
in PBS, pelleted, and adjusted to an optical density at
600 nm of 1.2 (corresponding to ca. 109 cells/ml) or 2.0
(2 × 109 cells/ml).
Plasminogen activation

Human Glu-plasminogen (4 μg; American Diagnostica), was mixed with 8 × 10 7 bacteria in PBS in a
total volume of 174 μl in microtiter plate (Nunc)

wells, and 30 μl of the chromogenic plasmin substrate
Val-Leu-Lys-p-nitroaniline dihydrochloride (S-2251,
2.5 mg/ml; Chromogenix) was added. Plasmin formation at 37°C was measured in a microtiter plate reader
at 405 nm.
Degradation of a2-antiplasmin and plasminogen

Cleavage of human a 2 AP (0.8 μg; Calbiochem) was
tested as detailed earlier [19,41], by using 3 × 107 bacteria and the incubation for 2 h at 37°C. Plasminogen
degradation with anti-human plasminogen antibody
(American Diagnostica) was assessed by incubating 2.5
μg human Glu-plasminogen and 4 × 107 bacteria in PBS
for 2 h shaking at 37°C. The cells were pelleted, and the
supernatants were boiled with SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Samples (10 μl) were run in a 12% (wt/vol) SDSPAGE gel and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (GE Healthcare). The detection was done
with polyclonal anti-human plasminogen antibody
(1 mg/ml, diluted 1:1000), peroxidase-conjugated antirabbit IgG (1:2500; GE Healthcare), and enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents (GE Healthcare)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The

Haiko et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:43

membrane was exposed to X-ray film (Agfa) for 15 s. In
assays where plasminogen cleavage was detected with
monoclonal anti-human plasminogen catalytic domain
antibody (R&D Systems), the following modifications
were made: Glu-plasminogen (3 μg) and 4.8 × 107 bacteria were incubated for 3 h. After incubation, supernatant samples of 15 μl were electrophoresed and
detection was done with the monoclonal antibody
(500 μg/ml, diluted 1:500) and peroxidase-conjugated
anti-mouse IgG (GE Healthcare; 1:1000). The exposure
time was 5 min.

(10 5 cells) in Medium 199 were added, and the plate
was centrifuged (128 × g, 10 min). The cells were incubated at 37°C with 5% CO 2 for 2 h. The wells were
washed with PBS, and the extracellular bacteria were
killed with gentamicin (100 μg/ml). ECV304 cells were
lysed with 0.2% Triton X-100, and the number of intracellular bacteria was determined by viable counting. The
invasion percentages were calculated by comparing the
amount of the bacteria incubated with the eukaryotic
cells to the amount of intracellular bacteria.
Molecular modelling of protein structures

Degradation of PAI-1/vitronectin complex

Recombinant active human PAI-1 (2.5 μg; American
Diagnostica) and human plasma Vn (5 μg; Promega)
were incubated for 1 h at 37°C in a volume of 5 μl to
form a complex [46]. Bacteria (20 μl, 4 × 107 cells) in
PBS were incubated with the complex for 2 h at 37°C.
The bacteria were pelleted, and the supernatants were
run in a 12% (wt/vol) SDS-PAGE gel, and PAI-1
and Vn were detected by Western blotting with polyclonal anti-PAI-1 (1:5000, Calbiochem) or anti-Vn
(1:1000, Calbiochem) antibodies, alkaline-phosphataseconjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (Dako) and
phosphatase substrate.
Detection of Pla-Epo hybrids with anti-Pla, anti-Epo, and
anti-Pla loop sera

The cell envelope samples were made by sonicating bacteria (109 cells/ml) in PBS on ice with 2.5 mM ethylene
diamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA). The remaining cells
were pelleted, and the supernatants were centrifuged
further. The cell envelopes in the supernatants were pelleted and suspended in PBS and SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Whole-cell samples were made by boiling the
bacteria (109 cells/ml) with SDS-PAGE loading buffer,
and the samples were loaded into a 12% (wt/vol) SDSPAGE gel, electrophoresed, and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The proteins were detected with a
mixture of anti-His 6 -Pla antiserum, antipeptide sera
against Pla loops 3 and 5 [19], and anti-His 6-Epo antiserum (1:1000). The detection was done with alkalinephosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G
(IgG; Dako) and phosphatase substrate.
Invasion into ECV304 cells

Endothelial-like ECV304 cell line was cultivated in Medium 199 (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal calf
serum (Gibco) and 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco) and
grown at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 3-4 days. Bacterial invasion into ECV304 cells was studied using gentamicin
protection assay [47]. ECV304 cells were grown at 24well plate (Nunc) for 3-4 days. The eukaryotic cells were
washed with PBS and Medium 199 was added. Bacteria

The omptin structures were modelled on the basis of
the crystal structures of Pla [18] (PDB code 2x4m) with
program Modeller 9v7 [48] and analyzed visually with
program VMD [49].
