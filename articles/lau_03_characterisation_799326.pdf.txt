Abstract
Background: So-called "immunoprivileged sites" are tissues or organs where slow allograft
rejection correlates with low levels of expression of MHC class I molecules. Whilst classical class
I molecules are recognised by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), some MHC class I molecules are
called "non-classical" because they exhibit low polymorphism and are not widely expressed. These
last years, several studies have shown that these can play different, more specialised roles than their
classical counterparts. In the course of efforts to characterise MHC class I expression in rat cells
obtained from immunoprivileged sites such as the central nervous system or the placenta, a new
family of non-classical MHC class I molecules, which we have named RT1-E2, has been uncovered.
Results: Members of the RT1-E2 family are all highly homologous to one another, and the number
of RT1-E2 loci varies from one to four per MHC haplotype among the six rat strains studied so far,
with some loci predicted to give rise to soluble molecules. The RT1n MHC haplotype (found in BN
rats) carries a single RT1-E2 locus, which lies in the RT1-C/E region of the MHC and displays the
typical exon-intron organisation and promoter features seen in other rat MHC class I genes. We
present evidence that: i) RT1-E2 molecules can be detected at the surface of transfected mouse L
cells and simian COS-7 cells, albeit at low levels; ii) their transport to the cell surface is dependent
on a functional TAP transporter. In L cells, their transport is also hindered by protease inhibitors,
brefeldin A and monensin.
Conclusions: These findings suggest that RT1-E2 molecules probably associate with ligands of
peptidic nature. The high homology between the RT1-E2 molecules isolated from divergent rat
MHC haplotypes is particularly striking at the level of their extra-cellular portions. Compared to
other class I molecules, this suggests that RT1-E2 molecules may associate with well defined sets
of ligands. Several characteristics point to a certain similarity to the mouse H2-Qa2 and human
HLA-G molecules.

Background
Mature MHC class I molecules are heterotrimers composed of a heavy chain polypeptide, a light chain (β2microglobulin) and a small molecular weight 'ligand' that
is usually, but not always, peptidic in nature. In all vertebrate species studied to date, MHC class I heavy chains are
encoded by several genetic loci, some of them highly polymorphic. The principal site of variation is the ligandbinding groove, formed at the apical face of the molecule
by the α1-α2 co-domain of the heavy chain. Most, but not
all of the MHC-encoded class I molecules characterised to
date are endowed with a role in presentation of antigenic
ligands to cells of the immune system that have cytolytic
activity. A distinction can be made, however, between
classical and non-classical class I molecules. Class Ia, or
classical, molecules are expressed at high levels on virtually all nucleated cells of the organism, with the notable
exception of cells found in some immunoprivileged sites
such as the central nervous system (CNS) and the placenta. Class Ia molecules are very heterogeneous within
an outbred population, particularly at the level of the ligand binding groove, which is used to present short peptides of endogenous origin to CTLs via their T cell receptor
(TCR). The main role of class Ia molecules is to allow CTLs
to detect and destroy cells invaded by viruses or intracellular bacteria, so limiting the multiplication and spread of
these pathogens. By contrast, class Ib, or non-classical,
molecules are expressed at much lower levels than the
classical ones, and in some cases they have more restricted
tissue distributions. They are also less polymorphic,
which could be explained in some cases by the fact that
they associate with ligands that are much less prone to
genetic variations [1]. For example, CD1 molecules can
present microbial phospholipids, H2-M3 selectively
binds to peptides carrying N-formyl-methionine residues,
and HLA-E and its functional homologues in other species, H2-Qa1 in the mouse and RT-BM1 in the rat, associate with sequences derived from MHC class Ia leader
peptides. Whilst others have proposed that these class Ib
molecules derived from convergent evolution [2], we have
argued that they are most probably orthologues [3].
Class Ib molecules can be recognised by a wide array of
receptors, including not only αβ TCRs but also γδ TCRs
and a whole variety of inhibitory or activatory receptors
present at the surface of NK cells, NKT cells and even cells
of the monocyte/macrophage lineage [4,5]. Hence, whilst
class Ia molecules have a prominent role in inhibiting NK
cell lysis, in line with the 'missing-self' hypothesis [6],
class Ib molecules can have more complex roles in modulating negatively or positively the immune response [7].
Prominent expression of certain class Ib molecules has
been found in immunoprivileged sites, e.g. HLA-G in the
human placenta [8] or RT1-U in the rat central nervous

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2172/4/7

system [9]. The definition of an immunoprivileged site is
a tissue where non-histocompatible grafts are rejected less
vigorously than elsewhere, such as in the central nervous
system, the anterior chamber of the eye or the placenta
[10]. During pregnancy, the foetus is tolerated by the
maternal immune system despite the fact that it effectively
represents a semi-allogeneic graft (and even fully allogeneic in the case of surrogacy). The expression of HLA-G in
the cytotrophoblast, at the foeto-maternal interface, in
place of the class Ia counterparts, HLA-A and HLA-B, has
long been suspected to contribute to this induction of tolerance. Whilst the precise 'raison d'être' of HLA-G is still
evasive [11], this molecule is clearly capable of performing functions that can either activate or inhibit immune
responses. On the one hand, when expressed in transgenic
mice, it can fulfil a role in antigen presentation to mouse
CTLs [12]. On the other hand, it is endowed with at least
four inhibitory functions relevant to immune responses:
first, it can bind directly to inhibitory receptors found on
NK cells and other leukocytes [4,5]; second, it possesses
the appropriate leader peptide for binding to HLA-E,
which will in turn inhibit NK cells via their CD94/NKG2
receptors [13]; third, as shown recently, soluble forms of
HLA-G produced by placental cells induce apoptosis of
activated CD8+ T cells [14], and fourth it can inhibit
CD4+ T cell proliferation [15].
The fact that no obvious orthologue of HLA-G has yet
been identified in rodents has made it difficult to investigate the precise role of this class Ib molecule, and somewhat tempers the notion of its potential pivotal
importance in the healthy development of foetuses during
pregnancy. In mice, two class Ib molecules have been suggested as potential functional homologues for HLA-G,
namely T25 [16] and Qa2 [17]. Whilst very little data on
the actual expression and function of the former have so
far been produced, more and more evidence has accumulated to suggest that Qa2 molecules have multiple characteristics reminiscent of those of HLA-G, namely the
capacity to activate alloreative CTLs [18], the existence of
soluble forms [19], the inhibitory activity towards NK
cells [20], and the expression in oocytes [21].
In rats, the expression in the placenta of transcripts encoding soluble class Ib molecules related to RT1-Eu was
reported earlier [22]. Interestingly, we have found that
transcripts for molecules very closely related to those
identified in placenta can also be found in neurospheres
[23], which are in vitro cultures of neural stem cells [24],
as well as in cDNA libraries of lymphoid tissues. Altogether, these form a group of sequences that are very
closely related to one another, and more distantly to the
RT1-Eu molecule [25]. We have therefore chosen to name
the members of this group RT1-E2, and report here on
their characterisation.

FACS analysis of MHC expression in neurospheres
FACS analysis of MHC expression in neurospheres. Cells were stained by indirect immunofluorescence and levels of expression
were analysed by flow cytometry as described in M&M. A: Time course comparison of staining levels attained with MRC OX18 (diamonds), which stains both class Ia and Ib molecules, or with F16.4.4 (circles) which stains only class Ia molecules. Days
of successive passages are indicated by P1, P2, P3. Similar results were obtained in two other experiments. B: FACS profile of
cells having aggregated as neurospheres after 48 h of culture. C: FACS profile of the CRNK cell line. For all experiments, both
antibodies were used at saturating concentrations.

Results
Neurosphere cultures express MHC class Ib molecules
In a previous report, we described our study of the levels
of MHC expression in cultures of rat neurospheres derived
from the LEW inbred rat strain [23]. At the time, we had
noticed that the monoclonal antibody (mAb) MRC OX18, which binds to the majority of rat MHC class Ia and
class Ib molecules, gave more reproducible results than
those obtained with F16.4.4, a mAb which stains only
class Ia molecules. To investigate this variability, several
experiments were carried out to compare staining
obtained with either MRC OX-18 or F16.4.4 in neural
stem cells, both at the time of their isolation and over time

as they started growing as neurospheres in vitro. Over several experiments, we consistently observed that:
(I) There was no detectable staining with either of the
antibodies in the cells freshly isolated from embryonic
striatum (Fig 1A).
(II) In those cells recovered in neurospheres after 48
hours, staining with MHC class I-specific antibodies could
consistently be detected, albeit at extremely low levels
(Fig. 1A). Given that the vast majority of the cells die during the first 48 hours of culture [26], it is unclear whether
this MHC class I expression was somehow induced, or
whether the capacity of cells to survive, aggregate and pro-

liferate correlates with a pre-existing low level of expression of MHC class I molecules at their surfaces.
(III) MHC class I expression in neurospheres rose progressively over the course of the first week, the staining
obtained with MRC OX-18 appearing sooner, and being
consistently higher, than that obtained with F16.4.4. In
some cases, such as the one shown in panel B of Figure 1,
we even obtained positive staining with MRC OX-18 and
absolutely none with F16.4.4, suggesting that neural precursors initially express MHC class Ib but no class Ia molecules, the expression of the latter arising after a delay of a
few hours or a few days. The differences in staining levels
were not due to a difference in staining efficiency between
the two mAbs since such a discrepancy was not found on
cells that express MHC class Ia molecules at high levels,
such as the CRNK lymphoblastoid cell line (Figure 1C).
Furthermore, in separate experiments on mouse L cells
stably transfected with RT1-Al, we also found that F16.4.4
always stains RT1. A molecules at least as well as MRC OX18 (not shown).
We also noted that, after the first passage and over the
course of the next two to three weeks, the MHC class I
staining levels, particularly those obtained with F16.4.4,
were much more difficult to reproduce between experiments, and could go up and down erratically at various
stages. Attempts to correlate these variations with cell density, neurosphere size, medium composition, time after
passage or feeding of cells were unsuccessful (not shown).
Cloning, classification and characterisation of RT1-E2
cDNAs
To identify which MHC class Ib molecules were predominantly expressed, we carried out RT-PCR on mRNA isolated from early stage LEW neurospheres, using PCR
primers designed to anneal to regions that are conserved
in most rat MHC class Ia and Ib transcripts [27–29] (see
M&M). A first screen was performed by transient transfection of COS-7 cells with 18 plasmid clones that contained
DNA inserts of the expected 1.1 kb size. Thirteen clones
drove expression of a molecule that behaved serologically
like the RT1-Al molecule, whilst the other five led to at best
very faint staining with the MRC OX-18 antibody, and no
staining with other RT1-Al-reactive mAbs, including
F16.4.4. Sequencing of these five clones revealed that one
corresponded to the RT1-Cl antigen [30], while the other
four were highly homologous (>98%) to one another and
to a sequence we had previously reported and designated
RT1-Eg [31]. These clones, and many others identified
from other sources representing a total of six MHC haplotypes as well as from additional screening of PCR-generated cDNA clones from LEW neurospheres and from LEW
placenta, are listed in Table 1. Comparative analysis of all
these sequences allowed us to identify and discount the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2172/4/7

numerous PCR-generated mutations, as well as the PCRgenerated hybrids, and to attempt to classify them according to their relatedness over the sequences from exons 4 to
8 (residues 181–356 of the protein alignment shown on
Figure 2). From previous experience [27,29], we know
that this portion of the genes for MHC class I molecules,
which codes for the α3 domain, the trans-membrane and
the intra-cytoplasmic regions is often the best locus indicator when comparing sequences from different MHC
haplotypes. As can be seen from Figure 3, phylogenetic
analysis of our collection of sequences confirmed their
close relatedness, and their separation from the group
formed by RT1-A molecules. For 11 out of 13 sequences
within this group, there is an even more striking level of
homology over the first 180 amino acids which constitute
the antigen binding groove, with very rare variations
observed at only five positions. Over the same region, the
remaining two sequences, RT1-Eu and RT1-Eav1, fall on the
same branch of the tree, but with a relatively low support
value. These two sequences are, however, more closely
related to other classical RT1-A sequences, or even to
human HLA-A2 or -G, or mouse H2-Q7 or -Q8/Q9.
We decided to call the members of the 11-strong group
RT1-E2 to mark their close relatedness to one another,
and their relative distance from RT1-E sequences. Remarkably, the number of RT1-E2 loci is apparently quite variable among haplotypes, but at least one locus is present in
every one of the six MHC haplotype we have analysed,
whereas RT1-E sequences were identified in only two out
of those six MHC haplotypes.
cDNAs deriving unambiguously from four separate RT1E2 loci were identified in the RT1l MHC haplotype carried
by LEW rats, which we call RT1-E2al, -E2bl, -E2cl and -E2dl.
We decided on this nomenclature rather than calling these
sequences -E2, -E3, -E4 because for some of the haplotypes where only one sequence was identified, the classification into those four loci is rather tentative since it relies
on only a handful of residues within the intracellular portion of the molecule (see Table 1 and Figures 2 and 3). For
example, for the RT1g haplotype, where only three clones
were obtained through RT-PCR, we cannot conclude
whether the differences between these are the result of
independent clones from three separate loci, or of PCRgenerated artifactual hybrids between sequences derived
from two or more loci.
One of the more remarkable features of these RT1-E2 molecules is the proportion of cDNA clones predicted to yield
soluble MHC class I molecules, and this via three different
mechanisms:

Alignment of RT1-E2 protein sequences deduced from the cDNA sequences summarised in Table 1with those of other rat class I
sequences. For E2ba (acc. AJ537439), the translated sequence ends prematurely because of a frameshift at the start of exon 5
(see text). The line E2ba* shows the notional downstream translation of the cDNA sequence if this frameshift was not present.
In the sequences from which the RT1-E2g (acc. AJ243338) sequence was compiled (p57, p4.4, p4.6), underlined residues correspond to positions that differ from all the other RT1-E2 sequences, and could therefore be due to either PCR mutations or
true allelic differences. Others accession numbers are as follows: E2bu: AJ537420, E2bl: AJ537417, E2an (deduced from
genomic): AJ315490, E2al: AJ276126, E2cl: AJ537418, E2dl: AJ537419, E2dc: AJ537441, Eav1: AJ537440, Eu: AJ306619, Al: L26224,

Phylogenetic comparison of RT1-E2 protein sequences
Phylogenetic comparison of RT1-E2 protein sequences. Phylogenetic trees were obtained by quartet puzzling [70], based on the
alignment of protein sequences shown on Fig. 2. Because they are subjected to different selective pressures, the upstream and
downstream regions of MHC class I molecules evolve differently, and at different rates. We therefore compared the sequences
separately. The left-hand side tree is based on comparing residues 181–356 corresponding to the α3 domain and the transmembrane and intracytoplasmic regions. Because of their high level of divergence after residue 275, the mouse and human
sequences were not included in this comparison. The right-hand side tree is based on comparing residues 1–180, corresponding to the α1/α2 co-domain that forms the antigen binding groove.

- First, transcripts from the RT1-E2al locus, which were initially identified in LEW placenta [22], all lack exon 5,
which codes for the transmembrane domain.
- Second, out of the five clones for RT1-E2bl also obtained
from LEW placenta, one carries a dinucleotide deletion at
the exon 4 to exon 5 boundary, due to the use of the first
two nucleotides (AG) of exon 5 as a splice acceptor
instead of the one that lies just in front (see Fig. 4). This
results in a frameshift and in a termination after a stretch
of 30 amino acids that are not particularly hydrophobic

and do not match significantly any known protein in
databases. The protein translated from such a transcript
would therefore most probably be soluble rather than
membrane bound. This observation suggests that, within
the same locus, alternate use of one or the other of these
two adjacent splice acceptors can lead to either a membrane-bound or a soluble molecule. It is worthy of note
that the very same type of frameshift was also found in the
single RT1-E2bav1 clone (Clone DA9) isolated from a
cDNA library from DA lymphoblasts. Since only a single
clone was obtained, we cannot be certain that the

upstream, 'canonical' AG acceptor site of exon 5 is present
in the RT1-E2av1 locus, and therefore whether such membrane-bound molecules can be produced from it.
- Third, the other four clones obtained from this DA
library were for the RT1-Eav1 molecule, and harbour a 36
nucleotide deletion in the middle of exon five, resulting in
the removal of the entire stretch of hydrophobic residues
that constitute the membrane spanning region.
Comparison of the large collection of RT1-E2 cDNAs that
we obtained revealed two sites where alternate splicing
events apparently take place, both of them in regions corresponding to the intracytoplasmic domain of the
protein. Firstly, at the junction of exons 5 and 6, the addition of 15 nucleotides results in a stretch of 5 amino acids
(TAFLL) in the final protein products. In RT1-Eu, RT1-E2al
and RT1-E2n this is systematic since it is due to a single
nucleotide mutation at the level of the splice acceptor at
the start of exon 6, which changes from the canonical AGGTGGGA, which is found in most rodent class I genes,
including RT1-Au [32], to AA-GTGGGA. This results in the
use of another AG splice acceptor found 15 nucleotides
upstream in the sequence of intron 5.
In parallel with this systematically different splicing, this
exon boundary is also the site of alternate splicing since
we did find that the upstream splice acceptor had been
used in one of the six bona fide E2cl clone and in one of ten

for E2dl, despite the presence of the canonical AG splice
acceptor (which was in those two cases carried by the
cDNA clones themselves). By comparison, it is probably
worth mentioning that equivalent events of alternate
splicing at that site have never been observed in any of the
several hundred cDNAs for RT1-A molecules that we have
analysed over the years.
On the other hand, exon 7 is a site where alternate splicing
has repeatedly been observed for many of the classical and
several non-classical rodent class I genes [28,33]. In our
case, exclusion of exon 7 was observed in one of the six
E2cl clones and in clone 4.6 classified as RT1-E2dg.
Finally, out of the three clones obtained from a cDNA
library prepared from PVG NK cells [34], and all deriving
from a single RT1-E2c locus, one was found to be only very
partially spliced, starting in the middle of exon 2, and still
carrying introns 2, 4 and 5 whilst the two others were correctly spliced out.
Searching with 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) sequences
from the RT1-E2 cDNA clones selected from polyAprimed libraries, scored hits with five EST clone in the
nucleotide database, all of which are derived from libraries assembled from mixes of various tissues obtained from
outbred Sprague Dawley rats, and so are uninformative
regarding the tissue distribution of RT1-E2 transcripts.
These clones cover very little of the coding sequence, and

Figure 4 of the RT1-E2n gene
Sequence
Sequence of the RT1-E2n gene. The sequence was derived after subcloning the upstream 2.8 kb Pst I and 4.5 kb BamH I DNA
fragments obtained by restriction digest of both the 473K19 and 303P13 PAC. Corresponding restriction sites are boxed. The
coding sequence is presented in black whilst non-coding regions (introns, 5' UTR and 3' UTR) are in grey. Splice donors (GT)
and splice acceptors (AG) are underlined, as well as the polyadenylation site. The fifteen nucleotides at the start of exon 6
which are boxed in dashed lines are predicted to be systematically present in the cDNAs for RT1-E2n, like those from the RT1Eu and RT1-E2al loci because the 'canonical' second splice acceptor (AG) is mutated to AA. For E2cl and E2dl, the second splice
acceptor is conserved as AG, and the corresponding 15 nucleotide segment is present in only a small proportion of the clones
obtained (see Table 1).

sequence comparison separates them into two groups (see
DNA alignment provided as supplemental data). The first,
which consists of BG372625, AW121555 and BI300597,
shows almost complete identity with the 3' UTR sequence
predicted from the RT1-E2n gene (see below). The
sequence available for the first two members of this group
stretches as far as the exon 5/6 boundary, and both clones
carry the extra 15 nucleotides discussed previously, due to
a mutated splice acceptor. The second group comprises
the BI281890 and BI283769 clones that are slightly divergent, but more homologous to one another than to any of
the other RT1-E2 sequences available to date. Because

both of these sequences end very close to the stop codon,
we could not conclude definitively whether they are representative of RT1-E2 or of another closely related locus
type.
Expression of RT1-E2 molecules is not restricted to
immunoprivileged tissues
On the basis of these multiple RT1-E2 sequences, we
designed a specific primer pair (E2us-E2ex5) that could be
used for the diagnostic PCR amplification of an internal
portion of the cDNA from the start of exon 3 to the start
of exon 5 (for more information, see M&M and DNA

alignment provided as supplemental data). Using this for
RT-PCR on mRNA derived from various LEW tissues, we
could detect a broad distribution of RT1-E2 mRNA, albeit
at lower levels than in the placenta. More specifically,
RT1-E2 transcripts were as prominent in placenta as in
neurospheres, readily detected in spleen, kidney and testis
but much more difficult to detect in mRNA prepared from
brain parenchyma (data not shown).
Cloning of the RT1-E2n gene
Searching nucleotide databases for homologues of RT1-E2
sequence only revealed one hit called "clone 4" (acc.
U50447). We have previously argued [31] that this "clone
4", a cDNA isolated by RT-PCR from BN rat splenocytes
[35] was probably a PCR-generated hybrid comprising the
550 nucleotide upstream part of a class Ib sequence,
where it differs from the sequence previously designated
as RT1-Eg by only two nucleotides, and the downstream
part of RT1-A1n. The fact that "clone 4" was isolated from
a BN rat suggested that the RT1n MHC region carries at
least one locus for an RT1-E2 sequence. The search for
RT1-E2 sequences in the BN haplotype was greatly facilitated by the physical map published by Ioannidu and colleagues [36]. A set of overlapping PAC clones covering the
MHC class I regions likely to contain the RT1-E2n (BN)
genes was obtained from the Resource Centre of the German Human Genome Project (RZPD, Berlin, Germany)
(see M&M). DNA from these PACs was digested by either
BamH I or PstI, and analysed by Southern blotting with
oligonucleotide E2us. This probe hybridised to the overlapping PAC clones 473K19 and 303P13, and revealed a
single BamH I fragment of 4.5 kb and a single Pst I band
around 2.8 kb. These bands were subcloned from the corresponding PAC and sequenced. The single sequence,
which covers 4992 nucleotides, comprises the entire
sequence of a class I gene, including 300 bp of its promoter and the 8-exon structure typical of most MHC class
I genes (Fig. 4). Our results suggest the existence of a single RT1-E2 gene in the RT1n MHC haplotype, and are compatible with this gene being located at the telomeric end
of clone O06367, which had been labelled as RT1-E on
the map published by Ioannidu and coworkers [36]. The
analysis of the entire genomic sequence of this region (acc
AJ314857) confirms this finding. The hypothesis that
"clone 4" is probably a PCR-generated hybrid is now further supported since the RT1-E2n genomic sequence that
we describe here matches the upstream sequence of
"clone 4" perfectly, but differs from it downstream.
Comparison of promoter sequences
RT1-E2 genes appear to follow a somewhat different pattern of expression from those of classical class I molecules.
This may be due to divergent sequences in the promoters
of these genes determining differential binding of transcription factors. We therefore compared the sequences of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2172/4/7

the RT1-E2n promoter with those of some other murine
class I genes, namely RT1-Al, RT1-Cl and H2-Kb (Fig. 5).
We also included in this comparison the sequence of an
840 bp PCR-generated genomic clone of LEW origin,
which starts 300 nucleotides upstream of the initiation
codon, and finishes in the middle of exon 2. This clone,
which was obtained by chance in the course of separate
investigations in our laboratory [37], very probably carries
the promoter and upstream region of the RT1-E2cl gene
since, over the upstream coding sequence where they
overlap, it is indistinguishable from the cDNAs from this
locus derived from LEW neurospheres and placenta. The
RT1-E2n and the RT1-E2cl promoter sequences differ only
in one nucleotide just after the TATA box sequence,
TGTAAA vs TGTAAG. Because the RT1-E2cl sequence
derives from a single clone generated by RT-PCR, we
cannot determine whether this difference is genuine or
whether it corresponds to a PCR-generated mutation.
Whilst the sequences of these RT1-E2 promoters are relatively well conserved compared to the other MHC class I
genes, several differences that are localised in the key regulatory DNA sequences can be observed. The three important elements within the core promoter are the CCAAT
box, the TATA box and the initiator [38]. The CCAAT box
is conserved among the genes that we compared. Whereas
H2-Kb and RT1-Al contain a canonical TATA sequence,
RT1-E2 shows the variant sequence TGTAA also found in
RT1-Cl and the mouse H2-Q6 to H2-Q9 genes (not shown
here). Since MHC class I gene expression is also dynamically regulated by cytokines, we examined the three major
elements within the upstream promoter region, namely
the κB1 element [39,40], the Interferon Response Element
(IRE) and site α, which is crucial for routes of activation
involving the transcriptional coactivator CIITA [41,42].
All three sites were identified in the RT1-E2 promoters,
but were found to diverge from those of other class I promoters by individual nucleotide differences that could
presumably result in alterations of its activity. Preliminary
experiments carried out with luciferase-based reporter
constructs containing either the RT1-E2n or the H2-Kb promoter suggest that the RT1-E2 promoter is much weaker
than that from H2-Kb, but that transactivation can be
boosted by the transcriptional coactivator CIITA and by
NF-κB (not shown). This finding is in line with a recently
published computer algorithm which predicts that the
sequence of the κB1 element found in RT1-E2 would still
support transactivation by NF-κB [43]. The activity of the
RT1-E2 promoter would thus still be subject to modulation by certain cytokines via CIITA and NF-κB, as
described for other MHC class I genes [38,44].

Expression of RT1-E2 in transfectants and its disruption by
inhibitors
An RT1-E2u cDNA clone derived from PVG-RT1u neurospheres was selected for the stable transfection of the
mouse L cell line. In the resulting G418-resistant cells
obtained, low levels of expression were detected with
MRC OX-18 in approximately 50% of the population.
Those cells were selected by flow cytometry, and were later
cloned in order to obtain a population that did not lose
expression of the RT1-E2u molecule over successive passages. The levels of MRC OX-18 staining attained with
these transfectants were better than in transiently transfected COS cells, but much lower than those seen with stable L cell transfectants for many other rat or mouse class I
molecules generated using the same procedure [27–
29,31,33] (Fig. 6). Treatment of the RT1-E2u L cells trans-

fectants with γ interferon resulted in a three to four fold
increase in the levels of cell surface expression detected, to
levels that remained very inferior to those detected for
class Ia counterparts (not shown). The possibility that this
low staining was not due to a low level of cell surface
expression but to a low affinity of MRC OX-18 for the
RT1-E2u molecule was ruled out by antibody titration
experiments showing similar saturating concentrations to
those observed for L cells transfected with RT1-A (not
shown). Analysis of these transfectants with other RT1reactive rat monoclonal antibodies has so far failed to
identify other antibodies crossreacting with the RT1-E2u
molecule (not shown).
The cellular requirements for RT1-E2 expression were
investigated as follows: correctly conformed MHC class I

The RT1-E2
Figure 6 u molecule is expressed at low levels at the surface of transfected L cells
The RT1-E2u molecule is expressed at low levels at the surface of transfected L cells. L cells transfected with either pSV2 neo alone,
or together with either pCMU-E2u, or pCMU-Au [28], were stained with saturating concentrations of MRC OX-18 hybridoma
supernatant, followed by a FITC-conjugated anti-mouse Ig secondary polyclonal reagent.

molecules were first removed from the surface of the L cell
transfectants by means of a brief acid treatment (pH 3.0).
Subsequent recovery of class I expression was measured
after six hours of culture in the presence or absence of various inhibitors, using MRC OX-18 to detect RT1-E2 and
mAb 11-4-1 to detect H2-Kk (endogenous to L cells). As
can be seen in Fig. 7, incubation of the cells with drugs
that inhibit either many of the cellular proteases (MG101) or more specifically the proteasome (MG-132), the
secretion pathway upstream of the Golgi apparatus
(brefeldin A) or transport through the Golgi apparatus
(monensin) resulted in each case in a significant reduction of the re-appearance of both RT1-E2u and H2-Kk at
the cell surface. The observation that the treatment with
MG101 resulted in a more dramatic inhibition of RT1-E2
expression than that of H2-Kk suggests that, in addition to

the proteasome, the generation of peptidic ligands suitable for binding to the RT1-E2 molecules may require the
contribution of additional proteases that would be very
sensitive to this drug.
In order to investigate the dependence of RT1-E2u expression upon a functional TAP transporter, we made use of
the fact that the ICP47 viral glycoprotein derived from
HSV-1 (Human Herpes Simplex Virus-1) can block TAP
function in the simian COS-7 cell line [45]. As can be seen
in Figure 8, co-transfection of either RT1-E2u or H2-Db
with ICP47 led to inhibition of cell surface expression for
both class I molecules, although this effect was more profound in the case of RT1-E2u. This result was confirmed in
parallel experiments in which RT1-E2u and H2-Db were
subcloned into bicistronic expression vectors expressing

Figure 7 of RT1-E2u molecules to the cell surface is affected by endoprotease inhibitors, and follows a similar pathway to that
of the H2-Kk class Ia molecule
Transport
Transport of RT1-E2u molecules to the cell surface is affected by endoprotease inhibitors, and follows a similar pathway to that of the H2Kk class Ia molecule. MHC molecules present at the surface of transfected L cells were denatured by a brief acid treatment (see
M&M). After being washed, the cells were then returned to 37°C to allow expression of new molecules, either in tissue culture
medium only, or in the presence of the indicated drugs. After 6 h, cell surface expression of the transfected RT1-E2u was measured by flow cytometric analysis after staining with MRC OX-18 (striped columns), or of endogenous H2-Kk with 11-4-1 (black
columns). Values used are based on means of fluorescence intensity, expressed as a percentage of re-expression compared to
the cells recovering in tissue culture medium alone.

EGFP after the Gtx IRES (see M&M). Gating on the EGFPexpressing cells after transfection of these vectors, a dramatic increase in the proportion of cells expressing the
MHC molecules was seen among the cells analysed (Fig.
8, right column). The levels of class I expression attained
per cell were, however, slightly lower using this system,
and this is particularly noticeable for RT1-E2u (panels C
and G). Considered together, these results suggest that
RT1-E2 molecules follow intracellular pathways similar to
those of classical class I molecules, and the dependence of
their surface expression on the TAP transporter and active
proteases points to their probable assembly with ligands
of a peptidic nature.

Discussion
In the developing mouse brain, expression of MHC class I
molecules has been reported to have a role in the establishment of neuronal connections [46,47]. These studies
also showed that different mouse MHC class I H2 loci displayed different well-defined spatio-temporal patterns of
expression. A similar finding was also recorded for RT1-U,
a rat class Ib molecule [9]. Whilst our finding of RT1-E2
expression in neural precursors does not prove its direct
involvement in the establishment of the CNS architecture,
this possibility will be worth investigating further.

The transport of RT1-E2u to the surface of transiently transfected COS-7 cells is dependent on a functional TAP transporter
Figure 8
The transport of RT1-E2u to the surface of transiently transfected COS-7 cells is dependent on a functional TAP transporter. For all panels, graphs are from flow cytometric analyses after staining either for H2-Db with B22-249 (upper four panels), or for RT1-E2u
with MRC OX-18 (lower four panels). The fine lines are for cells labelled only with PE-conjugated secondary antibody. For
both H2-Db and RT1-E2u, cell surface expression was significantly reduced when an expression-plasmid for the TAP-inhibitor
protein ICP47 was co-transfected. For the analyses shown in the right-hand column, the proportion of COS-7 cells expressing
the MHC molecule of interest was improved by transfecting bicistronic vectors carrying a Gtx IRES-EGFP sequence after that
of the MHC class I molecules (see M&M), and gating only on the EGFP-expressing cells for analysis.

Several other reports have also suggested that expression
of MHC class I molecules is generally low in cultures of
proliferating stem cells of various origins [48–51], with
some of these reports pointing to a preferential expression
of class Ib molecules comparable to our observations with
rat neurospheres [50,51]. In all these cases, however, it
may be that the expression of class Ib molecules themselves may not be upregulated, but becomes more noticeable when that of their class Ia counterparts is selectively
repressed.
The preferential expression of certain non-classical class I
molecules could be related to the observation that stem
cells are relatively insensitive to lysis by NK cells despite
their lack of class Ia molecules in certain systems [48]. The
fact that grafted stem cells can induce tolerance to
secondary allografts [52] could also be related to their
expression of class Ib MHC molecules endowed with
immunoregulatory functions. In other instances, however, the activity of NK cells can clearly play a very important role in limiting the efficiency of grafted cells survival
[53].
It is possible that RT1-E2 molecules could serve as markers
of neural progenitor cells that proliferate, or have the
potential to do so. If this were the case, RT1-E2 could be a
useful extracellular marker to enrich for rat neural stem
cells. This, however, will require the generation of RT1-E2
specific monoclonal antibodies. Given the striking level of
inter-strain conservation of the extracellular domain of
these molecules, and the fact that we have found RT1-E2
loci in all six of the rat MHC haplotypes we have studied,
it is probably not surprising that we have so far failed to
find RT1-E2-specific mAbs amongst the antibody panels
raised using conventional rat anti-rat immunisations.
Similar difficulties have been encountered in the past for
other MHC class Ib molecules, against which alloreactive
responses are weak or absent on account of the level of
sequence conservation, while xenoreactive antibodies
tend to cross-react broadly on many class Ia and Ib molecules. To overcome this hurdle, access to a transgenic
mouse expressing a rat class Ia molecule constitutively
would be extremely useful for immunisation purposes.
Comparison of RT1-E2 sequences with known mouse
class I genes has not revealed any obvious orthologue. On
the other hand, the H2-Qa2 family of mouse class Ib
genes does share several features with RT1-E2 that suggest
they may be related both genetically and functionally.
Firstly, the Q6 to Q9 loci, which encode H2-Qa2 molecules, lie in the region of the mouse MHC bordered by the
framework markers Bat1 proximally and Pou5f1 (Oct3/4)
distally [54]. This interval corresponds to the RT1-E/C
region in the rat within which we have mapped the RT1E2 locus of the BN rat. As for RT1-E2, the number of loci

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2172/4/7

for H2-Qa2 is variable between mouse strains, with up to
six functional loci found in the H2bc haplotype [55], all of
which are highly homologous to one another, and some
of which give rise to soluble molecules.
One factor that has greatly facilitated the study of Qa2
antigens is the fact that certain mouse haplotypes, e.g.
H2k, lack a functional Qa2 locus. Whilst this has allowed
the development of Qa2-specific alloreactive mAbs, it also
argues against a pivotal, indispensable, role of Qa2 molecules in the vital physiological processes of mice. But this
is of no great surprise since even mice made deficient for
the β2-microglobulin gene remain viable, despite the
alteration reported in their neuronal connectivity [47].
Another point worth mentioning is that certain strains of
β2-microglobulin KO mice breed very inefficiently [56],
and that loci affecting fertility have been described and
mapped to the region of the rat MHC where RT1-E2 genes
are found [57]. It is therefore conceivable that these
observations could turn out to correlate with the expression of these class Ib molecules in the placenta.
The Qa2 molecules have been shown to associate with
peptide ligands [58] and to depend on the TAP transporter for their expression at the cell surface [59]. The
recent crystallographic resolution of the Qa2 molecule
derived from the Q9 locus in combination with a nonameric self peptide revealed a shallow hydrophobic groove,
providing a plausible explanation for the relatively promiscuous specificity of this MHC class Ib molecule for
peptides [60]. When we used molecular modelling to visualise the peptide binding groove of RT1-E2 molecules,
we were struck by the overall similarity of the peptide
binding groove with that of H2-Qa2 (Figure 9). Not only
do both molecules harbour a very hydrophobic F pocket,
but they also carry histidine residues at position 9 and 70,
which could, as in H2-Qa2, result in the absence of a C
pocket, and in the bulging of peptides out of the middle
of the peptide binding groove.
Another recently uncovered property of H2-Qa2 molecules is their capacity to inhibit killing by NK cells [20].
Many inhibitory and activatory NK receptors have already
been uncovered in the rat, and genes carried in the RT1-E/
C region of the MHC are known to regulate the activity of
alloreactive NK cells [61,62]. Regarding the capacity of
MHC molecules to regulate NK activity negatively via their
CD94/NKG2A receptors, there exists a very particular
dichotomy at the level of the initiation of translation of
the murine class I proteins: some proteins start with MGAMAPRTLLL, whilst in many others, including most H2-K
alleles, the codon for the first methionine residue is
mutated and translation therefore starts at the second one.
In the latter case, it has been clearly shown that the
MAPRTLLL or MAPRTLLLL peptides resulting were unable

Molecular modelling of RT1-E2u was carried out on the Swiss model server http://www.expasy.ch/swissmod/SWISSMODEL.html. The coordinates of 1ED3, 1QLF, 1HOC and 1CE6 were used by the server as templates to generate this model.
The software Swiss PDB viewer was used to compare the resulting structure with those of RT1-Aa (1ED3), H2-Ld (1LDP) and
H2-Qa2 (1K8D). Acidic residues are represented in red, basic in blue, and hydrophobic in yellow.

to bind significantly to H2-Qa1 [63], and translation of
those class I molecules would therefore not result in the
inhibition of NK cells via their CD94/NKG2A receptors.
Whilst all rat class Ia sequences where this sequence is
known to start with the first methionine, this first ATG is
not present in many rat class Ib molecules including RT1Cl [30] and RT1-Eu [25], and the second methionine is
therefore used. Since both RT1-Cl and RT1-Eu have been
shown to be potential activators of allorecognition by NK
cells [62,64], there is therefore a correlation whereby the
molecules that can inhibit NK cell activity also have a
functional codon for the first methionine, and the ones
that can be recognised by NK activatory receptors do not.
In this regard, RT1-E2 molecules do harbour a functional
codon for the upstream methionine, and one might there-

fore be tempted to predict that their propensity would be
more towards inhibiting NK cells. If this turns out to be
true, this will be a further point of similarity with H2-Qa2
and HLA-G both of which have a potential role in inhibiting NK cell activity.

Conclusions
Over the past few years, MHC class Ib molecules have
been the focus of an ever-increasing amount of interest,
related to their multiple roles in antigen presentation and
immunoregulation, particularly of NK cell activity.
Because of their lower levels of expression and limited
heterogeneity, class Ib molecules have proven more difficult to study than their classical class Ia counterparts, especially because of the paucity of serological reagents. In

mice and rats, this is further complicated by the fact that
the MHC region carries many more class Ib loci than does
the human MHC. Unravelling the function and evolutionary history of rodent class Ib molecules will require
progressive characterisation of these various loci, and the
results described here should contribute significantly
towards this end.

Oligonucleotides
The oligonucleotides used had the following sequences:

EJ 001: 5'-GCTCTAGAGTCCAGGCAGCTGTCTTCA-3'
EJ 002: 5'-TGCTGCTGGCGGCCGCCCTGG-3'
E2us: 5'-TCGTCAAGGGACAGAATGGA-3'

Methods
Unless otherwise specified, all chemicals were obtained
from Sigma, France.
Animals
Rats were bred and maintained in specific pathogen-free
conditions at either the Babraham Institute (Cambridge,
UK) or the "Service d' Animalerie de l'IFR 30", Hôpital
Purpan, Toulouse, France.
Cell culture and chemicals
Neurosphere cell cultures were performed as previously
described [23]. Briefly, cells were prepared from the striatum of embryonic (E14) LEW rats. Following trituration,
cells were plated in growth medium containing HAM's F12/DMEM (1:3, Life Technologies) supplemented with
PSF antibiotic mix (1%, Life Technologies), EGF (20 ng/
ml, R&D Systems), FGF-2 (20 ng/ml, R&D Systems) and
N2 supplement (1%, Life Technologies), and passaged
every 7 days after trituration to a single cell suspension.

The mouse L (tk-) and simian COS-7 cells were grown in
DMEM (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal
calf serum (FCS) and passaged twice a week by trypsinization. For the analysis of the recovery of MHC class I
expression after acid wash, cells were collected, washed
twice in PBS and incubated for 1 min in 1 ml of 300 mM
glycine-NaOH (pH 3.0) supplemented with 1% BSA,
before being washed once in growth medium. The cells
were then returned to 37°C for 6 h either in growth
medium alone, or in the presence of inhibitors. MG-101
and MG-132 were stored in DMSO and used at 250 µM.
Brefeldin A, monensin were stored in EtOH and used at a
final concentration of 5 µM.
Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)
The mouse mAb MRC OX-18 [65] recognises an epitope
in the α3 domain of most rat MHC class Ia and Ib
molecules, whilst F16.4.4 [66] recognises only class Ia
molecules. Supernatants from hybridomas 11-4-1 [67]
and B22-249 [68] were used to label H2-Kk and H2-Db,
respectively. All four primary antibodies were used at saturating concentrations. For MRC OX-18, F16.4.4 and B22249, absolutely no cross-reactivity was detectable on
mock transfected COS 7 or L(tk-) cells.

Cloning of class I sequences by RT-PCR
This was performed as previously described [28]. Briefly,
mRNA was purified from either neurospheres or E17 rat
placentas. After oligo dT-primed reverse transcription,
PCR was carried out between oligonucleotides EJ 001 and
EJ 002 before cloning into the pCMU-Db plasmid via Not
I and Xba I sites. Plasmid DNA from recombinant colonies was subsequently analysed by restriction digestion
with BamH I and Pvu II, and positive clones were
sequenced using the Big Dye Terminator method (Applied
Biosystems).
Cloning of RT1-E2 cDNAs from cDNA libraries
Two cDNA libraries were screened. 1) a PVG NK cell
library prepared in the eukaryotic expression vector pMet7
[34] was amplified in E. coli DH10B (Life Technologies).
0.5 × 106 colonies were plated out, grown overnight at
37°C, and duplicate lifts made on to nylon-reinforced cellulose nitrate Opticron BA-S 83 0.2 uM membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). The membranes were denatured and
neutralised by standard procedures, dried and baked at
80°C in a vacuum oven for 2 h. The membranes were
hybridised with γ32P labelled oligonucleotide 380 in Puregene Hyb-9 Hybridisation solution (Flowgen) at 60°C
overnight. After several washes over 2 h in 2x SSC at 50°C,
the membranes were exposed to XR film (Fuji) for various
periods of time. Three duplicated positive spots were
selected and subjected to three rounds of purifying selection with oligonucleotide 380 to obtain single, positive
colonies.

2) 2 × 105 bacteriophages from a λgt10 cDNA library prepared from DA rat lymphoblasts [69] were plated out on

Page 16 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Immunology 2003, 4

C600 E. coli, grown for 8 h at 37°C then stored overnight
at 4°C. Duplicate lifts were made on to Opticron 83 or
Hybond N+ (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) membranes,
which were then treated and hybridised to oligonucleotide 380 as described for the PVG cDNA library. Five positive clones were subjected to three rounds of purifying
selection by hybridisation with oligonucleotide 380 to
give pure phage stocks. Phage DNA was obtained by PCR
using PWO DNA polymerase (Roche) and λgt10 forward
and reverse primers, using an annealing temperature of
55°C. The products were cloned into pSTBlue1 (Novagen) and sequenced.
Sequence analysis
Sequences were edited using GCG software (University of
Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI);
FASTA and BLAST were used for comparisons with
sequences in the online nucleotide databases. Database
accession numbers for the novel or published sequences
mentioned are given in the legends to Figures 2 and 5.
Phylogenetic analyses
Trees for comparison of sequences were obtained using
Puzzle [70], starting from the file of aligned protein
sequences shown on Fig. 2. One thousand quartet puzzling steps were used, and support values are indicated for
each branch. Trees were visualized using the "Treeview"
freeware package written by Roderic D. M. Page (available
on
http://taxonomy.zoology.gla.ac.uk/rod/
treeview.html).
Genomic mapping and sequencing
A set of overlapping PAC clones derived from the RPCI-31
library [71], and expected to cover the MHC class I region
containing the RT1-E2n gene, was purchased from the
Resource Centre of the German Human Genome Project
(RZPD, Berlin, Germany). From proximal to distal, these
are: RPCI-31 473K19, 303P13, 31C24, 374E16, 100B16,
571A22, 583F5, 460D3 and 462P8. PAC DNA was isolated using a standard alkaline lysis "miniprep" protocol.
DNA from these PAC was then digested either by BamH I
or Pst I. After agarose gel electrophoresis, DNA was transferred onto Hybond-N+ membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by passive transfer in 1.5 M NaCl and 0.5 N
NaOH. Hybridization was performed overnight with the
radiolabelled oligonucleotide probe E2us at 37°C in 5x
SSC, 12.5x Denhardt reagent, 0.5 M sodium phosphate
(pH 7.0), 2% (w/v) SDS, 0.1 mg/ml sonicated salmon
sperm DNA. Washing conditions were: 30 min at 37°C in
2x SSC, 0.1% SDS followed by twice 30 min at 50 °C in
2x SSC, 0.1% SDS. After washing, Kodak X-OMAT AR5
films were exposed to membranes for various times.

Plasmids
The pN3-ICP47 plasmid was constructed by cloning a Not
I/Hind III fragment obtained from the pCDNAI-ICP47
[45] into the pEGFP-N3 vector (Clontech). The pMCSGtx-EGFP was created by cloning the Gtx IRES [72]
between the Kpn I and the BamH I sites of the pEGFP-N1
vector (Clontech). The pDb-Gtx-EGFP and the pE2u-GtxEGFP plasmids were then constructed by blunt-end cloning the H2-Db and the RT1-E2u cDNA obtained respectively from the pCMU-Db and the pCMU-E2u vectors into
the Xho I (blunt-end) site of pMCS-Gtx-EGFP.
Transfection procedures
Stable transfection of L(tk-) cells with pCMU-Db or
pCMU-E2u was performed by the calcium phosphate
method using pSV2neo as a co-transfection marker [28].
Transfectants were then selected using 0.5 mg/ml G418
(Life Technologies), and cells expressing the appropriate
MHC molecule were selected by flow cytometry, using
MRC OX-18 for RT1-E2u, and B22-249 for H2-Db. After
selection, the cells retained similar levels of auto-fluorescence. Transient transfections of COS-7 cells were performed as previously described [73].
Staining of cells for flow cytometry
Cells were trypsinized and washed once in culture
medium before incubation with primary antibody on ice
for 30 min. The cells were then washed three times by centrifugation using cold PFN (PBS containing 2% (v/v) FCS
and 0.1 % (w/v) sodium azide) before incubation with
secondary antibody (fluorescein isothiocyanate [FITC]conjugated rabbit-anti-rat IgG diluted 1/100 in PFN) for
30 min on ice. After two washes in PFN, cells were resuspended in PFN containing 2 µg/ml propidium iodide and
analysed on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, USA)
within an hour of staining. For cell sorting, PFN was
replaced by sterile tissue culture medium, and an Epics
ALTRA (Beckman Coulter) was used.
