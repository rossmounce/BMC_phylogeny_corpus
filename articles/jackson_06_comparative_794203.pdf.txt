Abstract
Background: Tubulin isotypes and expression patterns are highly regulated in diverse organisms.
The genome sequence of the protozoan parasite Leishmania major contains three distinct β-tubulin
loci. To investigate the diversity of β-tubulin genes, we have compared the published genome
sequence to draft genome sequences of two further species L. infantum and L. braziliensis.
Untranscribed regions and coding sequences for each isoform were compared within and between
species in relation to the known diversity of β-tubulin transcripts in Leishmania spp.
Results: All three β-tubulin loci were present in L. infantum and L. braziliensis, showing conserved
synteny with the L. major sequence, hence confirming that these loci are paralogous. Flanking
regions suggested that the chromosome 21 locus is an amastigote-specific isoform and more
closely related (either structurally or functionally) to the chromosome 33 'array' locus than the
chromosome 8 locus. A phylogenetic network of all isoforms indicated that paralogs from L.
braziliensis and L. mexicana were monophyletic, rather than clustering by locus.
Conclusion: L. braziliensis and L. mexicana sequences appeared more similar to each other than
each did to its closest relative in another species; this indicates that these sequences have evolved
convergently in each species, perhaps through ectopic gene conversion; a process not yet evident
among the more recently derived L. major and L. infantum isoforms. The distinctive non-coding
regions of each β-tubulin locus showed that it is the regulatory regions of these loci that have
evolved most during the diversification of these genes in Leishmania, while the coding regions have
been conserved and concerted. The various loci in Leishmania satisfy a need for innovative
expression of β-tubulin, rather than elaboration of its structural role.

Background
Leishmania spp. (Trypanosomatidae: Kinetoplastida) are
vector-borne parasites of Man worldwide. The precise
pathology of leishmaniasis varies across the world
depending on which species and strain are concerned, but
many result in acute tissue necrosis and can be fatal. The
genome sequence of the aetiological agent of old-world

cutaneous leishmaniasis, L. major, was recently completed
[1] and this study addresses the impact of the genome
sequence on our understanding of β-tubulin repertoire in
Leishmania. β-tubulin is one half of the α/β tubulin dimer
that comprises eukaryotic microtubules and has been
interesting to molecular parasitologists as a model for

gene regulation [2], motility [3] and transcription [4] in
kinetoplastids and as a potential drug target [5,6].
The L. major genome sequence established that there are
three β-tubulin loci on chromosomes 33, 21 and 8 respectively, and a single α-tubulin locus on chromosome 13.
The genome project corroborated previous investigations
that predicted a tandem array of duplicated β-tubulin
genes at one locus, and two other singleton genes [7,8], in
contrast to the related kinetoplastid parasite, Trypanosoma
brucei, which has a single β-tubulin locus [9]. These loci
were expected based on distinct transcripts in L. major that
possessed characteristic length and specific expression
profiles relating to the life stage of the parasite [2]. Both L.
major and L. mexicana possess an amastigote-specific isoform that is solely expressed in mammalian macrophage
[10], and this apparent similarity suggests that all Leishmania spp. may have a diverse β-tubulin repertoire. In this
study, draft genome sequences for two further species, L.
infantum and L. braziliensis, causes of old-world visceral
and new-world muco-cutaneous leishmaniases respectively, were searched for homologs to the three L. major
loci.
Transcription in kinetoplastids is polycistronic and individual promoter regions for each gene are absent [11,12].
Regulation of gene expression takes place post-transcriptionally through recognition of motifs in the untranscribed regions (UTRs) resulting in differential processing
of transcripts and modulation of transcript decay [13-15].
This being so, the genomic environment around coding
sequences is of interest when inferring operational differences and β-tubulin isoforms can be expected to differ in
their 5' and 3' UTRs if they are differentially expressed. In
this study, the flanking regions around β-tubulin loci were
compared between and within species to identify relative
affinities and unique features.
The presence of three β-tubulin loci in Leishmania spp.
raises two related questions: why several loci exist in Leishmania when these are not necessary in other kinetoplastids and what, if any, are the functional differences
between loci. In the event of divergence among these loci
in the three Leishmania spp., the relative change in coding
and untranscribed regions will determine if functional
diversification has been derived from structural innovation, as in the case of vertebrate globins or immunoglobulins [16], or whether structurally conserved duplicates
are expressed distinctly, either spatially or temporally, as
with polyploid cotton [17]. As well as comparing flanking
regions to illuminate these issues, primary sequences of
all isoforms were analysed to identify the molecular signatures of evolutionary processes, such as recombination,
natural selection and gene duplication, which have
shaped β-tubulin sequences in Leishmania.

Results
Comparative genomics
Tiling reads from the L. infantum and L. braziliensis libraries produced contigs homologous to the chromosome 33
β-tubulin locus (appended as additional files 3 and 6).
The karyotype and linkage structure of L. major is common also to L. infantum and L. braziliensis [18,19], and
hence, the chromosomal position of these loci is assumed
to be conserved. Figure 1 demonstrates that gene order
was conserved both up- and downstream of the β-tubulin
array (which is shown with only two β-tubulin copies
since the precise number cannot be ascertained from tiling alone). For L. infantum, tiling inwards from either
flanking gene arrived at β-tubulin and tiling outwards
from either the N- and C-terminus of β-tubulin arrived at
another copy of the β-tubulin. For L. braziliensis, tiling outwards from β-tubulin arrived at another copy, confirming
the presence of an array (though see below). It was not
possible to tile inwards from flanking genes, although
these are present in a conserved gene order, because of
sequence gaps either side of the putative array. Despite the
lack of any notional links between the β-tubulin array and
chromosome 33, there was a physical link between βtubulin and a 40S ribosomal protein, which is found
upstream of the chromosome 33 locus in L. major. Likewise, there was a physical link between the L. infantum βtubulin and an ATPase (LmjF33.1010) found on chromosome 33 in L. major. Hence, despite the sequence gaps
either side of the arrayed genes, these physical links provide contextual evidence for β-tubulin tandem arrays on
chromosome 33 in all three species.

The genes flanking the chromosome 21 singleton β-tubulin in L. major were clearly represented in the two other
species, as shown in Figure 2. Tiling inwards from these
starting points revealed conserved synteny with the chromosome 21 locus and arrived at β-tubulin, although the
upstream intergenic sequence (IGS) in L. braziliensis is
substantially shortened. In L. infantum there were physical
links between β-tubulin and the upstream IGS (beyond
the point of homology with chromosome 33). In L. braziliensis there were physical links between β-tubulin and
both flanking genes, orthologs to chromosome 21 loci in
L. major. On this, as on other chromosomes, β-tubulin
retained the highest sequence homology between species,
other loci being more labile. Generally, the non-coding
sequences in L. braziliensis were not well conserved (with
some exceptions, see below), in contrast to L. infantum.
These contigs are appended as additional files 2 and 5.
Assembling homologs to the L. major chromosome 8
locus was complicated by the presence of a repetitive
region, duplicated such that it was on both sides of the βtubulin gene. When tiling upstream from the gene, the
presence of this motif meant that notional links were erro-

Comparison of the genomic region around the chromosome 33 β-tubulin copy in three Leishmania species
Figure 1
Comparison of the genomic region around the chromosome 33 β-tubulin copy in three Leishmania species. For each species,
coding regions are represented by shaded rectangles (scale in base pairs) along the chromosome. Contigs were assembled for
L. infantum and L. braziliensis from sequence reads and each assembled contig was aligned with the L. major genomic region using
the Artemis Comparison Tool (ACT). Blocks of percentage identity exceeding 80% are shown between chromosome cartoons. Locus identifiers refer to the published annotation http://www.geneDB.org.

neously inferred with the downstream duplicate (and the
same being true in reverse). As a result, using BLAST alone
to tile sequence reads gave the impression of tandem βtubulin genes. While this error has been avoided in the L.
major genome sequence, it was possible to produce the
same effect when tiling L. major reads for the corresponding region. However, after accounting for these duplicated, repetitive regions, tiling inwards from flanking
genes in both L. braziliensis and L. infantum produced
contigs that were homologous to the L. major locus (see
Figure 3 and additional files 1 and 4). As with both other
loci, there was conserved synteny in both directions and
there were physical links with other parts of chromosome
8 to corroborate the notional links implied by read tiling.
Comparison of flanking regions
All three β-tubulin loci in L. major have distinct 3' UTRs.
Within the tandem array on chromosome 33 the IGSs
between each pair of repeats was conserved at 2256 bp
and these had between 98% and 100% sequence identity.
Therefore, 3' UTRs within the array were near-identical,
with the exception of the last copy; here the 3' UTR was
almost entirely different, showing sequence homology
with the internal IGS for only 15 bp after the stop codon.
Due to sequence gaps, it was not possible to determine if
each locus had a distinct 3' UTR in L. infantum and L. braziliensis by tiling; however, of the three unique 3' UTRs
that could be discerned from BLAST searching in these
species, two were associated with the singleton loci and

therefore, this suggests that the array only comprises a single type of 3' UTR. It is not possible to comment on the
final 3' UTR of the L. braziliensis tandem array because this
data was not available; the final 3' UTR in L. infantum tandem array was quite unlike the internal IGSs.
The singleton loci have different UTRs to the tandem
array. However, in L. major the chromosome 21 and 33
loci shared 225 bp immediately upstream of the start
codon and 15 bp immediately downstream of the stop
codon. Beyond these regions, their UTRs were unalignable. Neither of the UTRs flanking the chromosome 8 locus
in L. major shared homology with the other two loci. This
situation was replicated in L. infantum and L. braziliensis,
where the chromosome 21 and 33 copies partially shared
5' UTRs, while 3' UTRs were largely unique in all cases.
Comparisons between species reflected their known phylogenetic relationships; the L. major and L. infantum IGSs
were highly conserved (generally in excess of 90%
sequence identity), whereas the IGSs in L. braziliensis were
divergent and seldom exceeded 90% identity. Despite
obvious divergence, when the 3' UTRs from the chromosome 33 and 21 assemblies in L. braziliensis were BLASTed
against all sequences in GenBank, their highest match was
with corresponding regions in other Leishmania spp. (4e12 and 4e-7 respectively). The identity of two L. mexicana βtubulin isoforms deposited in GenBank was uncovered by
comparing the distinct UTRs of each locus. This showed

that one isoform (M23441, [20]) closely matched the
chromosome 33 3' UTR (86 bp, 88% identical), while the
amastigote-specific isoform (AF345947, [10]) closely
matched the chromosome 21 locus (5' UTR: 67 bp, 85%
identical; 3' UTR: 750 bp, 84% identical).
Figures 1, 2, 3 clearly show that, although there was a general divergence between L. major/L.infantum and L. braziliensis IGSs, there were particular motifs in the 3' UTRs of
each L. braziliensis locus that display a conspicuously high
sequence conservation with their homologs in old-world
species. Figure 1 identifies two regions of the β-tubulin
tandem array IGS in L. braziliensis, located 246 bp (5'
GTGTACCGCAGTTGTTGGATCCGG 3') and 903 bp (5'
GCACTCGCGTTTTCTCGACGGCCCT 3') downstream of
the β-tubulin respectively, showing 100% and 96%
sequence homology respectively. Similarly, a region 894
bp downstream of the chromosome 21 β-tubulin was
96% conserved between L. major and L. braziliensis (5'
CATGCCTGCCTCTGTAGGTGCTTGTGCGT 3'). Finally,
two regions 505 bp (5' ACGCGCGCACTGCGGCACGGAGCGGGAGCTC 3') and 2788 bp (5' TGGCCACTTCCACCGCCACAGCACTCGCC
3')
downstream of
chromosome 8 locus were 93% identical to corresponding positions in L. major.
Sequence variation among isoforms
The two methods of read tiling and physical links produced identical sequences for the six β-tubulin isoforms
of L. infantum and L. braziliensis. The total amount of variation among isoforms from four species was very low

(average pairwise divergence: 0.0241), Figure 4 shows that
only nine amino acid sites displayed any phylogenetically-informative variation. These substitutions were not
diagnostic for either species or locus identity, that is,
sequence similarity by species or locus could not be predicted based on amino acid replacements. For example,
while the chromosome 21 and 33 assemblies for L. braziliensis share unique substitutions (I47M and I91V),
these were not shared by the chromosome 8 isoform.
Conversely, while chromosome 33 isoforms from all
three species share the gln440 substitution, this was also
found in the L. major chromosome 21 isoform. Of all the
informative changes, the isoforms appear to vary most at
two sites towards the N-terminus (A25S and S35T) and at
the C-terminus (E440Q).
Phylogenetic relationships
Likelihood mapping of sequence quartets was used to visualise phylogenetic signal among β-tubulin isoforms. The
results are shown in Figure 5; these demonstrate that a
large proportion of sequence quartets produced unresolved tree topologies (equivalent to the central portion
of the triangle: 19.1%). When this is added to those quartets with conflicting resolutions (equivalent to the each
side panel), a total of 27.8% of quartets could not be
resolved unambiguously. The prevalence of ambiguous
relationships was reflected in the ML phylogenies (not
shown), which were normally unresolved and not supported by high bootstrap proportions. The exceptions to
this pattern were the nodes uniting chromosome 8 isoforms from L. major and L. infantum (bootstrap value =

76) and the three L. braziliensis sequences (bootstrap value
= 100). The phylogenetic network shown in Figure 5
shows a consensus of all possible solutions to the phylogenetic tree, emphasising the various, and equally plausible, ways of depicting isoform relationships. No clear
definition can be made between chromosome 33 and 21
isoforms in L. major, L. infantum, and to some extent, L.
mexicana, but L. braziliensis isoforms are robustly monophyletic.
Analysis of sequence variation
No evidence was presented by dN/dS ratios for positive
selection; on the contrary, values for ω were consistently
less than 1, indicating that β-tubulin sequences have been
under purifying selection. Values for ω ranged from 0
(between chromosome 21 isoforms from L. mexicana and
L. infantum) and 0.335 (between L. mexicana isoforms).
Values for ω when comparing L. braziliensis with any other
species were significantly lower than when comparing
species other than (or within)L. braziliensis (t = 3.553, df =
53, p < 0.001). Thus, the number of non-synonymous
substitutions was noticeably reduced in genetic distances
over the greatest time periods.

There was no evidence for recombination among isoforms; both DSS and PDM methods showed that there
were no significant differences in phylogenetic signal
along the length of the sequence alignment. Therefore, all
nucleotide sites support a single phylogenetic history.
However, as Figure 5 shows, there was considerable ambiguity as to the precise branching patterns in this history.

Given that this ambiguity largely derived from a lack of
information, it follows that the test for recombination is
limited because few significantly different topologies will
be produced by a data set that lacks signal generally. In
any event, the general conservation of these sequences
makes site-specific recombination unlikely since this is a
diversifying process.

Discussion

This study has established that all three β-tubulin loci, and
the single α-tubulin locus, found in L. major are present in
L. infantum and L. braziliensis. Amino acid replacements
among β-tubulin sequences are scarce; those that occur
are generally idiosyncratic but certain substitutions warrant further analysis. Of particular note are the replacements affecting the C-terminus; at position 440 all array
isotypes possess a glutamic acid residue, while all singleton isotypes (with the exception of the L. major chromosome 21 copy) have a glutamine. Additionally, the L.
braziliensis chromosome 21 and 8 copies have an aspartic
acid to glutamic acid replacement at position 437. These
E440Q and D437E replacements fall within the
'axoneme-specific motif', which is important for flagellar
function [21,22], consistent with evolutionary specialisation of these isotypes to life stages with modified flagellar
function. Conversely, there are no replacements affecting
the region important for post-translational glutamylation
[23], located upstream. Towards the N-terminus, the A25S
and S35T replacements also seem to preferentially affect
the singleton loci and this may be important; it is the
amastigote-specific locus that possessed a serine at posi-

tion 25, as is normal for most eukaryotes, whereas alanine
was at this position in all the arrayed paralogs. In a gene
where concerted evolution and negative selection are
strong, constant pressures for conservatism, it is unlikely
that these replacements are the result of neutral divergence. Indeed, there was a consistent under-representa-

tion of silent changes. Hence, while most of the
evolutionary change associated with these loci has
occurred in the non-coding regions, these few coding substitutions may yet prove to be functionally significant.

Comparison of flanking regions supports the view that
these loci produce unique transcripts with specific expression profiles. The conservation of gene order around each
locus confirms that these three loci are paralogous, i.e.,
that the ancestor of these three Leishmania species possessed a β-tubulin tandem array on chromosome 33 and
singleton β-tubulin on chromosomes 21 and 8. In a clear
contradiction of these conserved gene orders, the phylogenetic relationships suggested by Figure 5 indicate that paralogs within L. braziliensis and L. mexicana are more
similar to each other than any are to their orthologs in
other species. This situation is not extended to isoforms in
L. major and L. infantum, where the precise relationships
are unclear.
UTR structure and the regulation of β-tubulin repertoire
Leishmanial β-tubulin isoforms display a low substitution
rate in coding regions but a substantial structural divergence of UTRs. Comparisons between species demon-

strate that non-coding sequences rapidly lose structural
homology over time, although isolated sections of highly
conserved sequence may point to functional constraints
on IGS divergence; the first conserved domain described
for chromosome 33 above contains a Leishmania RNAbinding site GGATC [2]. Besides diverging after speciation, the most important feature of these comparisons is
that UTRs are typically dissimilar among loci and within a
locus in the case of the tandem array. The exceptions to
this are the similarity between the chromosome 33 and 21
loci in the 5' UTRs, and the very beginning of the 3' UTRs.
These exceptions notwithstanding, the unique genomic
environments around each locus corroborate the three
distinct β-tubulintranscripts of 2200 bp, 2800 bp and
3200 bp, identified in L. major by [2], each predominantly
expressed in the promastigiote, amastigote and infective
metacyclic life stages respectively. Alignment of the cDNA
deposited by [2] with the genome sequences shows that
the 2200 bp transcript (GenBank: X93566) corresponds

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:137

to the internal tandem array copies and the 2800 bp transcript (GenBank: X93567) corresponds to the chromosome 21 singleton. It is now clear that these different
transcripts are facilitated by divergence in the 3' UTRs of
the various loci, including the terminal UTR of the tandem array, which is quite unlike its internal counterparts,
and results in the distinct 3200 bp transcript in the metacyclic stage. Hence, it is likely that these very conservative
proteins have acquired diverse expression profiles
through restructuring of their flanking regions. This reinforces the view that 3' UTR structure is crucial to the
expression profile of any gene through post-transcriptional regulation (rather than promoter regulation) in
trypanosomatids [4].
It is intuitive that the various life stages of the Leishmania
spp. could be the basis for differentiation of β-tubulin isoforms. The promastigote inhabiting the insect gut, the
non-proliferating metacyclic form waiting in the insect
salivary gland for passage to a vertebrate, and the amastigote, aflagellate within the mammalian macrophage, each
experience a different environment and may have suitably
different β-tubulin expression requirements. Unique
flanking regions described here demonstrate that the
amastigote-specific transcripts identified in L. major [2]
and L. mexicana [10] derive from the chromosome 21
locus. The 2200 bp and 3200 bp transcripts identified by
[2] originate at the tandem array. The role of the chromosome 8 locus, with its distinctive UTRs, remains elusive;
given that it appears more distinct from the two other loci,
in both coding and non-coding respects, this gene may
fulfil a more distinctive role and could conceivably vary in
spatial expression as well as temporal. In summary, the
distinctive genomic environments surrounding each βtubulin locus in Leishmania suggest that these different
loci satisfy a demand for diverse expression patterns,
rather than structural innovation. In the context of polycistronic transcription, this could not be delivered by the
tandem array on chromosome 33; the conserved flanking
sequences within the array offer no opportunities for differential regulation of the copies, except for the terminal
UTR, which has been extensively modified. Therefore,
paralogous loci may have evolved in response to the derivation of new life stages in Leishmania.
Convergent evolution via ectopic gene conversion
The relationships in Figure 5 show that the phylogeny of
β-tubulin genes in Leishmania has not simply been a matter of diversification through the inheritance of orthologs.
There was insufficient evolutionary change among the isoforms from L. major and L. infantum for their relationships
to be resolved. However, the monophyly of the three L.
braziliensis isoforms was robustly resolved, which suggests, paradoxically, that they are each other's closest relatives. These loci are clearly paralogous and the conserved

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/137

gene order across three species demonstrates that all three
loci precede the separation of those species from their
common ancestor. There was no evidence to support
either positive selection towards some consensus
sequence or site-specific recombination; in fact, the dN/dS
ratio was always less than 1 and indicative of purifying
selection. Therefore, convergence has not occurred
according to a fitness benefit associated with conserving a
canonical β-tubulin structure. This result can be explained
as a consequence of concerted evolution, which has operated to homogenise the different loci in a time-dependent
manner.
In the absence of positive selection or recombination
between isoforms, ectopic gene conversion may provide a
mechanism for homogenisation. Ectopic gene conversion
is the unilateral recombination between non-allelic gene
copies and has been shown to be a common and important process in gene family evolution [24]. In contrast to
allelic gene conversion, an ectopic event occurs between
all or part of unlinked loci. They have been shown to
occur among amylase and heat-shock proteins in Drosophila [25,26]; it is invoked in the origin of novel multihistocompatibility complex alleles in mammals [27-29],
but is most notably documented among vertebrate haemoglobin genes [30,31]. Ectopic gene conversion is also
known to affect Plasmodium falciparum [32,33], where it is
responsible for the generation of sequence variation
among var genes [33], which are the basis for immune
evasion. This process could account for the homogenisation of β-tubulin paralogs, while also accommodating
other observations. First, L. braziliensis and L. mexicana
isoforms are not completely homogenised, but the operation of gene conversion as a conservative influence on
sequence evolution does not preclude the continued substitution of bases under mutation or selection pressure.
The total divergence of two sequences would be a balance
of these pressures. Second, L. major and L. infantum isoforms are very similar but not homogenised; this would
be expected if these species only recently diverged and
gene conversion is a relatively rare event between paralogous loci in trans. It is known that the frequency of conjugation and subsequent conversion events declines with
physical distance between loci and their sequence homology [34,35]. Finally, the flanking regions of β-tubulin paralog have clearly not been homogenised. This is not
implausible given that gene conversion often affects particular domains, rather than an entire locus. For instance,
the exons of ruminant lyzozymes are known to convert,
while the introns and flanking regions diverge [36]. In this
instance, the non-coding regions may have diverged
under positive selection to provide specific expression
profiles for each locus; since all three Leishmania species
display the same patterns of variation in the UTRs (e.g.,
chromosome 33 and chromosome 21 loci show partial

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:137

identity in their 5' UTRs but distinct 3' UTRs), it is likely
that divergence occurred rapidly in a common ancestor
and has been maintained by purifying selection since.
Whereas very strong purifying selection on the coding
regions ensured that the structural function of β-tubulin
was unchanged. While the conservation of coding regions
provides a situation susceptible to conversion, the functional divergence of non-coding regions has abolished
identity, thereby precluding homogenisation by homologous recombination, which would presumably be maladaptive if it were to occur.

Conclusion

Since the origin of the distinct β-tubulin loci in Leishmania, there has been substantial evolution of the untranscribed regions, in stark contrast to the conservation of
coding sequences among all isoforms. The partial remodelling of UTRs had previously been indicated by distinct
transcripts belonging to specific life stages. This variation
has now been directly related to variation in the genome
sequence. In addition to the tandemly-arrayed isoform on
chromosome 33, Leishmania spp. possess a singleton
locus on chromosome 21, which shares partial affinity
with the arrayed isoform in its UTRs, and a further singleton on chromosome 8 that shares no affinity with other
UTRs and the expression of which remains uncharacterised. These findings indicate that the evolution of distinct
UTRs relating to these loci has been coincident with the
modification of their expression profiles. However, the
conservation of the β-tubulin protein sequence suggests
that the structural function has remained unchanged in
the different life-stage contexts. In demonstrating the paralogous nature of the three β-tubulin loci, this study has
shown that concerted evolution, perhaps through ectopic
gene conversion, has operated to maintain uniformity
among coding sequences. Therefore, a subtle balance of
concert and divergence in different regions of these loci
might have allowed β-tubulin repertoire to evolve during
the derivation of parasitism in Leishmania, while preserving its fidelity in fundamental cell function.

Methods
Contig assembly
Contigs were assembled for each locus in L. infantum and
L. braziliensis respectively by tiling together sequence reads
selected from read libraries available at GeneDB http://
www.geneDB.org. For each tiling movement a 100 bp section from the end of a read was used as a probe for BLAST
searching. The BLAST search located another read with
overlapping sequence; 100% affinity was required
between the probe and matching reads to be accepted.
Contigs were built by tiling repeatedly in this manner
both inwards (i.e., starting with flanking genes and tiling
up- or down-stream) or outwards (i.e., beginning with
tubulin and tiling up- or downstream). For all of these

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/137

assemblies, L. major coding sequence (either tubulin or
flanking genes) was used to initially probe the read libraries in geneDB. In the event of a sequence break (i.e., where
no sequence read overlapped with the probe), the process
was restarted by probing with the L. major sequence
(whether coding or non-coding) homologous to the missing data. The resultant gap in the contig could then be
bridged by a physical link, that is, by finding a pair of
sequence reads positioned on either side of the gap. Tiled
reads were assembled into contigs and annotated in
Artemis v7. Contigs from all three Leishmania species were
aligned in ACT v4, which calculated sequence affinity with
L. major and base composition for the two putative
homologous sequences.
Isoform assembly
Contig assembly provided isoform sequences through the
tiling procedure but it was noted that these may be erroneous where, as in the case of tubulin, a lack of uniqueness means that the correct notional link may not be
obtained. The three β-tubulin isoforms possess identical
central portions and so using the N terminus to tile downstream does not guarantee the appropriate C-terminus
and may result in a chimeric assembly. Therefore, isoforms were assembled according to physical, rather than
notional, links. Reads matching to β-tubulin were identified in each library; the corresponding read pair was then
retrieved from the libraries. Isoforms were assembled by
tiling together all reads with physical links to other parts
of a given chromosome.
Phylogenetic reconstruction
A sequence alignment was created from the assembled
isoforms plus two L. mexicana β-tubulin sequences deposited on GenBank. These sequences were an amastigotespecific isoform (AF345947, [10]) and another isoform
retrieved from a whole genome digestion by probing with
chicken β-tubulin (M23441, [20]). The phylogenetic
information contained in the alignment was visualised
using likelihood mapping in TreePuzzle v4.0 ([37], http:/
/www.tree-puzzle.de). This technique selects all quartets
of sequences from the data set and calculates the likelihood value of three resolutions for each, using a generaltime reversible (GTR) model [38] estimated from the
data. Likelihoods are mapped into an equilateral triangle.
Quartets mapping into any corner represent successful
resolutions and indicate that signal exists. Those mapping
to the centre of the triangle represent polytomies due to
inadequate signal between the four sequences. Those
mapping to the sides of the triangle reflect difficulties in
choosing between resolutions because of conflict within
the data.

Likelihood mapping showed that phylogenetic signal was
relatively low and conflict between character states rela-

tively frequent. A maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree
was estimated using a GTR+I+Γ model, parameterised
from the data in PAUP*4.0b [39] and non-parametric
bootstrapping [40] was applied through 100 heuristic
searches. Given the low resolution observed in the phylogenetic tree, a better method for phylogenetic reconstruction was one that explicitly represented the uncertainty in
the data set. Therefore, a phylogenetic network was estimated in Splitstree v4.0 ([41], http://www.splitstree.org),
using a neighbour-net algorithm [42] and logdet genetic
distances [43] to correct for any potential base composition bias.
Positive selection
The signature of natural selection can be detected in
nucleotide sequences through estimation of the ratio of
non-synonymous (dN) to synonymous (dS) substitutions,
known as ω[44-46]. Values of 0 and 1 for ω represent ideal
states of purifying selection and selective neutrality
respectively. Where dN exceeds dS this is evidence for positive selection [47,48] Positive selection was a possible
explanation for the phylogenetic patterns observed and
therefore the sequence alignment was scored for dN and dS
in DNAsp v4.10.3 [49], to estimate for ω for each
sequence pair.
Recombination
Another potential explanation for the phylogenetic estimates was site-specific recombination between β-tubulin
genes. Potential recombination break-points can be identified from multiple sequence alignments through a variety of methods, most of which detect significant
differences in phylogenetic signal between adjacent sites
[50]. A sliding window approach was applied using
TOPALi v0.27 [51]. Two different procedures were
applied to compare adjacent sequence windows and to
detect significant departures from a single phylogenetic
history within the same alignment. First, difference of
sums of squares (DSS, [52]) compared the fit of genetic
distance matrices for two adjacent windows to the same
tree topology to produce the DSS statistic, the significance
of which was determined through parametric bootstrapping in TOPALi. Second, probabilistic divergence measures (PDM, [53]) were used to compare different tree
topologies in adjacent sequence windows using a Markov
chain Monte-Carlo approach to estimate marginal posterior probabilities for each topology. This method has the
advantage of removing any effects due to rate heterogeneity among the sequences. For both DSS and PDM, the window size was fixed at 100 bp and the step size at 10 bp.
