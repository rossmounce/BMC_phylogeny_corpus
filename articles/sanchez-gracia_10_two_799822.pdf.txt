Two Frequenins in Drosophila: unveiling the
evolutionary history of an unusual Neuronal
Calcium Sensor (NCS) duplication
Alejandro Sánchez-Gracia1,2*, Jesús Romero-Pozuelo1,3, Alberto Ferrús1

Abstract
Background: Drosophila Frequenin (Frq), the homolog of the mammalian Neuronal Calcium Sensor-1 (NCS-1), is a
high affinity calcium-binding protein with ubiquitous expression in the nervous system. This protein has an
important role in the regulation of neurotransmitter release per synapse, axonal growth and bouton formation. In
D. melanogaster, Frequenin is encoded by two genes (frq1 and frq2), a very unexpected feature in the Frq/NCS-1
subfamily. These genes are located in tandem in the same genomic region, and their products are 95% identical in
their amino acid sequence, clearly indicating their recent origin by gene duplication. Here, we have investigated
the factors involved in this unusual feature by examining the molecular evolution of the two frq genes in
Drosophila and the evolutionary dynamics of NCS family in a large set of bilaterian species.
Results: Surprisingly, we have found no amino acid replacements fixed across the twelve Drosophila species
surveyed. In contrast, synonymous substitutions have been prevalent in the evolution of the coding region of frq1
and frq2, indicating the presence of strong functional constraints following gene duplication. Despite that, we have
detected that significant evolutionary rate acceleration had occurred in Frq1 in early times from the duplication, in
which positive selection (likely promoting functional diversification) had probably an important role. The analysis of
sequence conservation and DNA topology at the non-coding regions of both genes has allowed the identification
of DNA regions candidates to be cis-regulatory elements. The results reveal a possible mechanism of regulatory
diversification between frq1 and frq2.
Conclusions: The presence of two Frequenins in Drosophila and the rapid accumulation of amino acid
substitutions after gene duplication are very unusual features in the evolution of the Frq/NCS-1 subfamily. Here we
show that the action of positive selection in concordance with some extent of regulatory diversification might
explain these findings. Selected amino acid substitutions in Frq1 likely contributed to the functional divergence
between the two duplicates, which, in turn, should have diverged in their regulation by Ecdysone-induced early
genes.

Background
Many different aspects of neuronal function, including
neurotransmitter release from synaptic vesicles, are regulated by alterations in the concentration of intracellular
free Ca2+ [1,2]. The transduction of calcium signals into
appropriate physiological responses is frequently mediated
by a range of calcium sensor proteins, which act as effectors and modulators in signalling pathways [3]. The specific effects of these changes depend on their affinity for

Ca2+ , their cellular localization in relation to the Ca 2+
entry signal and their interaction with other proteins. A
number of calcium binding proteins related to the ubiquitous protein Calmodulin are overrepresented in or
expressed only in the nervous system. These include the
family of intracellular Neuronal Calcium Sensor (NCS)
proteins [4-6]. Members of this protein family, which have
been identified in many organisms ranging from yeast to
mammals, bind Ca2+ at their EF-hand domains and regulate many important processes in neuronal signalling. This
family can be divided into five subfamilies or classes (A-E)
based on their amino acid sequence similarity [3].

Drosophila Frequenin (Frq), the homolog of the mammalian Neuronal Calcium Sensor-1 (NCS-1), was the
founder member of the NCS family and the first to be
characterized being, at this time, the only component of
the class A [7]. Frequenin is a high affinity calciumbinding protein composed by two pairs of EF-hand
motifs with ubiquitous expression in the nervous system. Its over-expression enhances facilitation and
increases release per synapse [8,9]. Also, the levels of
Frq in motoneuron control the number of boutons and
branching, strongly suggesting a role in modulating axonal growth and bouton formation [8,9]. In Drosophila
melanogaster, this calcium sensor is encoded by two different genes, frq1 and frq2 [9], which are located in tandem in the same genomic region (spaced by 11.6 kb).
These two genes show a similar intron-exon structure
and a high amino acid sequence similarity (they differ in
only 10 residues [9]). All these features clearly support
an origin by gene duplication and suggest that the
encoded proteins would still perform similar functions
in D. melanogaster. In addition, the prospective search
[7] across some fully sequenced genomes failed to detect
duplicated copies belonging to this subfamily, with the
exception of the zebrafish Danio rerio [10]. In this species, like in Drosophila, there are two independent Frequenin encoding genes. In D. melanogaster, both genes
have very similar temporal and qualitative expression
profiles but their quantitative levels differ [9]: while frq1
mRNA is 2-3 fold more abundant at the end of the
embryo stage and in 1st instar larvae than in the adult,
frq2 mRNA always reaches its peak expression level in
the adult. Comparing the mRNA expression in the
adult, frq1 shows a 20-30% higher level than frq2. Significant expression in the ventral ganglia was found for
both genes, and this expression appears to be specific.
Interestingly, the reduction or abolishment of Frequenin
activity in flies does produce neither lethality nor sterility, which originally suggested a small contribution to
individual fitness of these proteins. The analyses of
over-expression and loss-of-function phenotypes, nevertheless, showed that mutants had larval locomotion
defects, deficient synaptic transmission, impaired Ca2+
entry and enhanced nerve terminal growth, demonstrating a relevant role of Frequenin in the development and
function of the nervous system [9,11].
In order to understand the causes of the atypical preservation of two frq genes in Drosophila, we have analyzed nucleotide and amino acid sequence variation of
frq1 and frq2 across the twelve species of the Drosophila
genus with the complete genome sequenced [12].
Besides, we have also examined amino acid sequence
evolution of the other members of NCS protein family
to identify functionally important sites responsible for
differentiation between subfamilies. We have found that

positive selection had an important role in the fixation
of some of the amino acid changes found between Drosophila Frequenins. The results also show that these
changes probably shaped the functional differentiation
between the two copies. Finally, the evolutionary analysis of non-coding sequences suggests that gene expression differences observed between these two genes
might be, at least in part, consequence of the different
evolution of regulatory regions after gene duplication.

Results
Two old and highly constrained Frequenins in Drosophila

We have found that the 12 Drosophila species have two
genes encoding Frequenin. In all species, the orthologues of frq1 and frq2 are located in the syntenic region
of the X chromosome and maintain nearly the same
gene structure (i.e. exon/intron number and sizes; Figure
1). The frq1 genes of D. sechellia and D. pseudoobscura
are situated in genomic contigs that contain several gaps
filled with ‘N’ and they are not complete. In spite of
that, partial coding regions available for these genes
have no mutations truncating the open reading frames
or generating stop codons, suggesting that both are
functional copies. In order to be conservative in our
further analysis, however, we used only complete coding
regions for comparisons.
Both genes show high levels of silent nucleotide divergence across the Drosophila genus. The Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimate of the total tree length (using
PAML software) for synonymous substitutions per
synonymous site, ds, is 1.96 and 2.98, for frq1 and frq2,
respectively. As expected from an independent evolution
after gene duplication, the ML average estimate of
synonymous divergence between paralogues (ds = 1.78)
is higher than across orthologues (frq1, ds = 0.58; frq2,
ds = 1.07), with little evidence for concerted evolution
(based on a gene conversion analysis; data not shown).
Surprisingly, despite the extensive divergence at synonymous sites, no nonsynonymous substitution has been
detected across orthologous copies of neither frq1 nor
frq2. In fact, non-synonymous divergence is exclusively
restricted to between duplicates (dN = 0.036), resulting
in the 10 fixed amino acid differences between Frq1 and
Frq2 proteins previously detected in [9]. Furthermore,
estimates of silent variation suggest that frq1 and frq2
have evolved at different evolutionary rate across the
Drosophila genus since results of the two-cluster test
confirm that frq2 accumulates synonymous substitutions
faster than its paralogue (two-cluster test in LINTRE,
P-value = 0.007). Using BEAST, we have estimated the
age of duplication in 104 My (95% posterior density: 78135 My; Figure 2), which implies that the two copies
originated at some point before the split of the Drosophila and Sophophora subgenera (~60 Mya).

Accelerated evolution of Frq1 in early stages after gene
duplication

In contrast to Drosophila, the other surveyed insect species hold only one frq gene (Figure 2). All these single
insect homologues are co-orthologues of Drosophila
frq1 and frq2 (i.e., they are orthologues of both Drosophila copies), likely indicating that the duplication postdated the split between Drosophila and Ceratitis
relatives. The putative sequence of the ancestral Frequenin, reconstructed by a ML approach (with PAML software) using the JTT distance [13] (which correspond to
the best-fit amino acid substitution model in the model
selection analysis), was used to polarize the 10 replacements fixed between duplicates; interestingly, nine of
them occurred in the Frq1 lineage (only the substitution
in the position 58 seems to have occurred in Frq2;
amino acid positions are numbered relative to the
sequence of Frq1, a convention used throughout this
report). In fact, amino-acid substitution rate is significantly different between paralogues after duplication
(using Ceratitis capitata Frequenin as reference and the
JTT distance; Relative Rate Test module in Hyphy package, P-value = 0.05), which is consistent with an acceleration of amino-acid substitution rate in Frq1.
Replacements are broadly distributed along the primary
structure of Frq1 with three of them included within
EF-hand domains. Figure 3 shows the location of the
residues with nonsynonymous substitutions in the modelled 3D structure. There is no apparent spatial coupling
among residues, except for the two pairs that are contiguous (161 and 162) or very close (91 and 94) in the
primary structure. We have also investigated the relationship between amino acid substitutions and residue
accessibility. We have found that five residues (positions
5, 58, 94, 102 and 138) should be exposed in the Frequenin ancestral protein whereas the rest (79, 91, 161
and 162) were probably less accessible. Thus, in contrast
to the observations for other proteins [14], solvent exposure does not seem to be a major structural determinant
of Drosophila Frequenins residue evolution.
To determine whether functional constraints changed
after gene duplication we have performed a ML analysis
using the codon substitution models implemented in
PAML software (Figure 4). The evolutionary scenario
allowing different nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rates ratio, ω, in the internal branches leading
to the frq1 and frq2 lineages (Model 3) clearly shows the
best-fit to the data (Model 2 versus Model 1, P-value =
1.92 x 10-7; Model 3 versus Model 2, P-value = 0.0002).
This result implies that selective constraints acting on
the two copies changed both immediately after the
duplication event and some time before the split of the
Drosophila genus species. ML estimates of the ω parameter in these lineages (Figure 2) advocate for a

Page 4 of 13

relaxation of functional constraints acting on frq1 gene
just after gene duplication or, alternatively, for the
action of positive selection driving some of the replacements found in the protein encoded by this gene.
Divergence of non-coding frq1 and frq2 sequences

The evolutionary fate of duplicated copies can be also
determined by changes in non-coding regions (i.e. regulatory divergence). We have analyzed nucleotide divergence at non-coding sequences of frq1 and frq2 in six
species of the Sophophora genus. The Dot Plot of the
complete genomic region containing both genes (Additional file 1) clearly shows coding exons as the only
regions with significant sequence similarity between
both genes, i.e. intron and flanking non-coding
sequences do not retain signals of the duplication event.
In contrast, the phylogenetic shadowing analysis using
PhastCons reveals a number of significantly conserved
non-coding sequences (CNS) across species, which
might indicate the presence of functional regulatory elements (Additional file 2). Interestingly, some of these
CNS are located in the two large introns of these genes
(see Figure 1), which might have been maintained across
Drosophila genus because of their functional role.
Among these CNS, we have identified a number of
topologically highly accessible transcription factor binding (TF) motives that could be involved in the regulation of frq1 and frq2 in these species (Additional file 2).
Interestingly, the motives for two factors, DL-2 (dorsal2) and Brc (Broad-complex) are only present in frq1
whereas binding sites for Eip74EF (Ecdysone induced
protein 74EF) appear exclusively in frq2. Although a few
species have putative binding sites for Brc and Eip74EF
factors in one duplicate, in all cases only one of the sites
maintains its position across the subgenus. Apart from
these differentially distributed TF binding sites, the regulatory regions of frq genes have also highly accessible
conserved sites for Ubx (Ultrabitorax), HB (Hunchback),
Sna (Snail) and HSP-1 (Heat Shock Protein 1). In addition, we have found a number of accessible CNS with
no apparent TF binding site present in surveyed databases, which might represent regulatory regions for
other factors not yet identified.
Amino acid sequence evolution in the NCS family

In order to better understand the evolutionary history of
Frequenin in Drosophila, we have also analyzed protein
sequence evolution of this subfamily in a large set of
bilaterian species. The phylogenetic analysis (Multiple
Sequence Alignment (MSA) with the 38 Frequenins
with complete sequence) shows that Frq/NCS-1 is a
strongly conserved protein - the mean expected number
of amino acid substitutions per amino acid site is 1.037.
The most variable positions are outside the EF-hand

domains, which are well conserved. The evolutionary
rate of positions with changes between Drosophila Frequenins is variable, some of them being among the
most conserved positions (Additional file 3). Results of
the exhaustive search for homologous copies in databases (we found homologues of Frequeninin more than
50 bilaterian species, with representatives in major taxonomic groups) confirm that duplications are rare in the

evolution of this subfamily; in fact, no fixed duplication
has been found other than the already known in Danio
rerio [10]. The two zebrafish copies (ncs1a and ncs1b)
are noticeably younger than frq1 and frq2, i.e. the closest
species in our data set with only one Frequenin is Pimephales pomelas, which diverged from Danio rerio 20-50

homogeneously distributed between paralogues after
gene duplication (using the sequence of P. pomelas as
reference, 3 and 3 changes in NCS1a and NCS1b,
respectively, and one ambiguous replacement).
To evaluate the possibility that amino acid substitutions between Frq1 and Frq2 were correlated, we have
searched for the presence of coevolving positions across
the Frq/NCS-1 subfamily MSA. The analysis based on
correlation coefficients [17] does not detect any significant intra-molecular co-evolution across bilaterian Frequenins. In contrast, the CTMP model approach [18],
allows detecting 40 pairs of amino acid sites with significantly more double substitutions than expected under
the best-fit amino acid substitution model. The predicted positions are scattered across the sequence and
only the C-terminal is free of putative co-evolving positions. No coordinating residues of the EF-hands appear
among the sites with high score, with the only exception
of position 79, located at the second EF hand. Some of
the predicted coevolving pairs enclose positions with
amino acid differences between Frq1 and Frq2 proteins
(positions 58, 79, 102 and 138 in Drosophila Frq1).
Nevertheless, one of these positions (position 58) corresponds to the substitution in the Frq2 lineage and no
significant pair is composed by two sites with replacements in Frq1.
We have investigated whether amino acid substitutions between Frq1 and Frq2 are actually involved in
functional divergence (rather than representing compensatory changes). For that, we extended the analysis to
the other NCS subfamilies. The rate of evolution is
remarkably different both among subfamilies and
between the members of the same NCS class (we analyzed the 14 subfamilies that compose the 5 NCS
classes; Table 1 in [6]). NCS-1 and VILIP1 are clearly

the most conserved subfamilies (the average root-to-tip
length of the vertebrate tree for amino acid substitutions
per site is 0.017 and 0.025, respectively) whereas GCAP
subfamilies evolve faster than the rest (ranging from
0.297 to 0.739). The results of the functional divergence
analysis in Diverge software reveal that positions 58, 79,
91, 102, 138, 161 and 162, have been involved (they are
among the 5% highest values in the posterior probability
profiles) in functional constraints changes and specific
functional divergence between NCS subfamilies (Table
1). These positions show site-specific shifts of evolutionary rate (type-I functional divergence) and/or of amino
acid property (type-II functional divergence). Interestingly, although the specific amino acids present in positions 79, 102 and 162 of Frq1 and Frq2 are not the
same than those responsible for type II functional divergence between NCS proteins, they also denote radical
changes in Frq1 (i.e. in terms of charge and hydrophobicity). This suggests that they might have been involved
in cluster specific functional divergence between Frq1
and Frq2 [19]. The same occurs with position 58, which
imply a radical change in Frq2. The putative contribution of the positions 5 and 186 to functional divergence
between subfamilies was unachievable because of the
high levels of divergence in the C- and N-terminal parts
of the NCS proteins. The rapid evolution of these
regions prevented a confident identification of positional
homologies for the two sites.
Among the amino acid positions replaced between
Frq1 and Frq2, positions 58, 79, 102, 161 and 162 are
the more firm candidates to participate in the functional
diversification of the NCS family (Table 1). These five
positions are involved in many independent rate shift
changes across the evolution of NCS members, although
the particular amino acid residues and the type of

divergence depend on the comparison. Position 58 contributed to the functional divergence between members
of the class E and representatives of the classes A and
B. Positions 79 and 102 were involved in several rate
shift changes associated with functional divergence
between all NCS subfamilies and between families
belonging to the classes A, B and C, respectively. Position 161 is a functional diverged site between KChIPs
and other subfamilies, whereas the contiguous position,
162, is among the sites with high posterior probability
in different comparisons between all NCS classes. Interestingly, these five positions, which involve chemically
radical changes between Frq1 and Frq2, also participated
(apart from in type I) in type II functional divergence
between NCS subfamilies. Finally, positions 91 and 138
(with chemically conservative changes in Frq1) are candidates only for type I functional divergence (between
KChIPs and Frequenin and Recoverin, respectively).

Discussion
The NCS family includes members with very different
evolutionary rates, which provide insights into their
diversification in both structure and function. Among
these calcium sensors, Frq/NCS-1 appears to be one of

the most conserved subfamilies, not only at the amino
acid sequence level but also because of their very low
propensity to retain gene duplications - no other fixed
duplication has been detected here except in D. rerio.
For that reason, the discovery of a fixed and long-term
stable (estimated as > 100 Mya) duplication in Drosophila, as well as the rapid and heterogeneous accumulation of amino acid changes between duplicates,
constitutes a very unusual feature for this family. Understanding the basis of this finding may contribute to the
better knowledge of molecular evolution of NCS proteins as well as of important fields as the origin and fate
of duplicated genes and of functional innovation.
Gene duplications arise initially in a single individual
and can become fixed in the population by natural
selection or by random genetic drift. Initially, duplications generate functional redundancy, a situation that is
generally non-advantageous; hence, even if duplicates
have been fixed by chance, the accumulation of mutations will result in the disruption of structure and function of one of the duplicates, which becomes a
pseudogene (i.e. a non-functional gene). Results of
nucleotide and amino acid variation analyses performed
here clearly demonstrate that amino acid changes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/54

observed in Drosophila Frequenins are not the result of
this pseudogenization process. The coding sequence of
frq1 shows strong functional constraints across the Drosophila genus as well as within a D. melanogaster population
(unpublished results) and none of the nine amino acid
substitutions affecting the encoded protein was disruptive,
pointing to purifying selection as the main force acting on
this gene. In addition, analysis of loss-of-function and
over-expression phenotypes also point to the role of both
Frq1 and Frq2 on synaptic transmission and nerve terminal growth [9,11].
Several theoretical models have been proposed to
explain the maintenance of duplicated genes, which consider different mechanisms of preservation and subsequent
optimization [20-25]. The main differences among models
rely in which part of the gene is involved (coding or noncoding sequences) and in the relative role of natural selection and genetic drift in determining the outcome of
duplication. Dealing with protein sequence evolution, two
duplicates can be preserved without the action of positive
selection just by the selectively neutral division of different
subsets of the original functions between daughter copies
(product subfunctionalization). Nevertheless, this situation
is not compatible with present data because of: i) the distribution of mutations after gene duplication is significantly different from the one expected under neutrality,
and ii) the strongly selective constrains acting on amino
acid positions affected by these mutations across the Drosophila genus. We would expect that positions with
degenerative mutations removing ancestral functions
evolved in a completely neutral way.
The amino acid substitution pattern observed in Frq1
might result from the fixation of nearly neutral mutations (and so governed largely by genetic drift) in an
initial period of relaxation, just after gene duplication,
followed by a subsequent increase of functional constraints in Drosophila. Environmental conditions responsible for these constraint changes would affect frq1 and
frq2 in a different way as suggested by the highly biased
distribution of amino acid substitutions detected
between these paralogues.
Accordingly, some functional or regulatory diversification from the native state between Drosophila Frequenins would be needed. In this context, some models of
structural evolution such as compensatory mutations
[26] or conformational epistasis [27] might generate the
observed evolutionary pattern. In the first, some variants
are fixed by positive selection to compensate deleterious
mutations in other epistatically interacting positions.
Under this model, some of the amino acid substitutions
in Frq1 ought to have been selected to maintain protein
structure or function rather than be adaptive [28].
Under the conformational epistasis hypothesis, most of
the Frq1 mutations should have been slightly deleterious

Page 8 of 13

or permissive substitutions (i.e. small-effect) that stabilized specific structural elements in this protein allowing
further positively selected mutations-which in the
absence of previous small-effect mutations should destabilize the protein. These mutations could have conferred
a new function and then increased selective constraints
in Drosophila. Although we have found evidences of
molecular co-evolution across the Frq/NCS-1 subfamily,
none of the predicted coevolving amino acids involves
two positions with replacements in Frq1. This finding
should rule out structural evolution as the main explanation for the rapid accumulation of amino acid substitutions between duplicates. Nevertheless, the probability
of observing more double substitutions than expected
by chance largely depends on the presence of relatively
strong epistatic interactions between mutations. If both
Frequenins have very few potentially permissive substitutions, the probability of observing repeated pathways
across the subfamily should be very low. Under this
situation, we will have very little power to detect signals
of co-evolution between amino acid sites across the
alignment. An in-depth experimental study would be
needed to analyze the putative contribution of these
structural evolution models in generating the pattern
observed in Drosophila Frequenins.
The recurrent fixation of advantageous mutations might
also account for the excess of amino acid substitutions in
Frq1. ML estimate of the d N /d S ratio in the internal
branch leading to Drosophila Frq1 sequences is actually
higher than in the rest of the branches of the Drosophila
Frq phylogeny. Although the estimate is considerably
lower than 1, as well as lower than genomic averages
reported for the Drosophila genus [29], this result does
not exclude the possibility that positive selection acted in
the fixation of certain Frq1 changes. It has been largely
demonstrated that positive selection commonly acts on
few amino acid positions in a protein and, therefore, present estimates based on the complete coding sequence
could be too conservatives. Frequenin is a highly conserved protein, with very low ω estimates across bilateria
(the pair-wise ω ratios calculated between vertebrate NCS1 sequences range from 0 to 0.0065; d N /d S data from
Ensembl Genome Browser) and, therefore, even a significant increase in the number of amino acid changes could
not be greatly reflected in the average ω value calculated
from the entire protein. In fact, when we applied to the
data a much more powerful branch-site approach [30],
results were marginally significant (results not shown).
Even so, we have to interpret this result with caution
because it has been reported that this method often generates false positives under certain conditions [31,32].
All simple models for the preservation of frq1 and frq2
in Drosophila considered above that are compatible with
the existing data require the action of positive selection.

Thus, the key question that remains unsolved is if natural selection promoted a functional change between
Frq1 and Frq2 in Drosophila. We investigated whether
positions differing between paralogues are involved in
functional diversification between other members of the
NCS family. The fact that many of these positions are
candidates to participate in significant amino acid substitution rate shifts between NCS subfamilies suggests
that Frq1 and Frq2 might have diverged (at least to
some extent) in their functions. It is difficult to determine, however, the specific functional features that
could have diverged between these two proteins. Most
of the positions with changes between Drosophila Frequenins are among the most probable functionally
diverged residues in many subfamily comparisons. The
putative specialized roles in neural function of Drosophila Frequenins might result from differences in the
affinity to Ca2+, sub-cellular location or targeted proteins [6]. It has been demonstrated that sites of the
C-terminal part of the human NCS-1 interact with target proteins [33]. Also, we had shown that the last 33
amino acids of the Drosophila Frq1 and Frq2 act as
dominant negative peptide, with effects in synaptic
transmission and terminal morphology [9]. Thus, the
two candidate C-terminal positions, 161 and 162 (and
perhaps the position 187) might have promoted some
diversification in the interaction with target proteins.
On the other hand, the replacements observed in these
two sites might have also produced changes in Ca 2+
binding either directly, because they are located in the
fourth EF-hand, or by producing structural changes
affecting protein thermostability and Ca2+ affinity of the
other EF-hands [34-36]. The position 79 is one of the
coordinated residues of the second EF-hand and, therefore, replacements in this site might also be related with
Ca2+ affinity differences between paralogues. The amino
acid fixed in Frq1 in this position is hydrophilic and
highly exposed, in contrast to the hydrophobic and buried ancestor. This feature might indicate a possible
structural change produced by the replacement in this
position. Binding sites for target proteins have been also
mapped in the N-terminal part of the human Frq/NCS1protein [37]. Consequently, substitution in positions 58
(and perhaps in 79 and 102 in Frq1) might have altered
the interaction properties of Frq2 with some of their
partners. The other good candidate to participate in
functional divergence between NCS subfamilies, the
position 102, is located in the loop connecting the second and third EF-hands. The homologous region in
GUCA2 determines the concentration of Ca2+ that activates the target of this protein [38]. Then, the replacement in this position might also affect the Ca2+ binding
properties of Frq1, contributing to the functional divergence of duplicates in Drosophila.

Finally, in addition to the retention and diversification
of protein coding regions, regulatory divergence is also
prevalent in the evolution of duplicated genes [39]. In
fact, it has been proposed that subfunctionalization of
regulatory regions can increase the mutational space
accessible to duplicates, removing selective constraints
and allocating neofunctionalization [40]. The mRNAs of
frq1 and frq2 are expressed in D. melanogaster with a
similar spatio-temporal pattern, but with important
quantitative differences [9]. These quantitative differences could be related with the significantly different
silent evolutionary rate found between these two proteins since it has been shown that gene expression levels
are negatively correlated with evolutionary rates [41].
Here we found that Brc and Eip74EF factors might be
involved in the regulatory divergence of these two duplicates. Suitable Bcr binding sites are only present in regulatory regions of frq1. In fact, frq1 and br (the locus
encoding Brc proteins) [42] mRNAs have a very similar
expression pattern in late stages of embryo development
(both appear in brain and ventral nervous system at
embryo stages 13-16; http://www.fruitfly.org/cgi-bin/ex/
insitu.pl), coincident with the peak of frq1 expression.
Eip74EF, in contrast, appear only in early metamorphosis, after the major pulse of Ecdysone in the third larval
instar, being consistent with the higher expression of
frq2 mRNA in adult flies. Hence, differences in the
response to these two Ecdysone-induced early genes
might be responsible, at least in part, for the differences
in gene expression levels between duplicates. This regulatory diversification might render the action of positive
selection suitable, resulting in further functional diversification at the protein level. The current in silico analysis sets the frame of future experimental studies on the
regulation of frq1 and frq2 expression, as well as on the
functional mechanisms of the corresponding proteins.

Conclusions
The increasing availability of sequenced genomes from
polymorphic to highly divergent taxa has allowed the
application of phylogenetic and molecular variation analyses across different time scales. This approach has proven useful to disentangle evolutionary processes that
were not completely resolved in previous comparative
genomic or population genetics studies. Using this
approach we found that positive selection, acting on
protein sequence evolution, jointly with the diversification of non-coding regulatory sequences, might be the
main forces responsible for the origin and preservation
of the unusual Frequenin duplication in Drosophila. The
results of this study of variation at the molecular level
of Frequenin sequences will inspire future experiments
on the mechanisms for protein function and gene
regulation.

Methods
Sequence searches

We used TBLASTN tool [43] against public databases to
search homologues of the Drosophila Frq1 and Frq2
proteins. The databases surveyed were: i) the twelve
complete Drosophila genomes available in FlyBase [44]
ii) the genomes of invertebrate vectors of human pathogens in VectorBase [45], iii) the dbESTs database in
GeneBank [46] and iv) eukaryotic genomes available in
ENSEMBL project [47]. In addition, we retrieved all proteins annotated as members of the NCS family from
ENSEMBL database (family accession number:
ENSFM00500000269655). Orthologous relationships
were assigned using the BLAST reciprocal best-hit
approach together with gene tree and species tree
reconciliation and synteny conservation. Gene structure
features of Drosophila orthologues were revisited and
adjusted using the information of FlyBase annotated
genes (http://rana.lbl.gov/drosophila/; Drosophila 12
Genomes Consortium) as a guide.
Nucleotide sequence analyses

The DNA sequences corresponding to the coding
regions of frq1 and frq2 genes were multiple aligned
using the Mafft software [48], and manually edited with
MacClade version 3 program [49]. The resulting multiple sequence alignment (MSA) was used to estimate
nucleotide sequence variation in DnaSP version 5.0 [50],
and MEGA version 4 [51] software. To determine if
paralogous genes evolve at different substitution rates
we conducted the two-cluster test implemented in the
LINTRE package [52].
BEAST version 1.4.8 [53] was used to place the duplication event that produces frq1 and frq2 copies on the
insect phylogeny and to obtain a posterior density of the
duplication age. The tree was built using the 21 complete Drosophila coding regions available plus the
sequence of 6 other insects. We set constraints on divergence times of i) the Drosophila and Sophophora subgenera, ii) the melanogaster and obscura groups and iii)
the divergence of the species belonging to the melanogaster subgroup. These ages were set in uniform distributions with ranges previously published [54]. We used
divergence at synonymous sites with a relaxed, uncorrelated lognormal clock and the HKY85 nucleotide substitution model [55] with gamma rate heterogeneity. The
length of the Markov chain was 5000000, with a sample
frequency every 200. The first 2500 trees were discarded
in the burn-in step.
Selective pressures acting on coding regions after gene
duplication and the estimates of synonymous and nonsynonymous rates, including total tree length for synonymous substitutions, were estimated using the ML

Page 10 of 13

approach implemented in PAML version 4 [56]. Since
homologous sequences identified in mosquito and Drosophila are highly divergent (they might yield unreliable
estimates of the relevant parameters) we used only the
21 Drosophila coding regions and the sequence of the
fly Ceratitis capitata for the analysis. The ratio of nonsynonymous (dN) to synonymous substitution rates (ds),
ω = dN/dS, was used as the measure of protein selective
constraints [57]. Competing models (Figure 4) were
compared in a Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT), assuming
that twice the log likelihood difference between the two
models (2Δℓ) follows a c2 distribution with a number of
degrees of freedom equal to the difference in the number of free parameters [58]. To prevent incorrect parameter estimates caused by local optima, the program
was run multiple times for the same model, specifying
different initial values.
In order to identify the regions of DNA sequence
similarity produced by the duplication event, a Dot Plot
of the complete genomic region (~66 kb) that includes
frq1 and frq2 (and andorra) genes in D. melanogaster
was obtained in the Zpicture tool web [59]. Moreover, a
MSA corresponding to this genomic region in 6 Drosophila genomes (D. melanogaster, D. simulans, D. erecta,
D. yakuba, D. ananassae, and D. pseudoobscura) was
obtained from the pre-computed alignments of Comparative Assembly Freeze 1 (CAF1) http://rana.lbl.gov/
drosophila/caf1.html available in VISTA server [60].
This MSA was used to perform a phylogenetic shadowing [61] search for conserved (orthologous) non-coding
regions using the hidden Markov model (phylo-HMM)
approach implemented in PhastCons [62]. We used the
UCSC genome browser database [63] aligment of all
CDSs in the genomic fragment corresponding to the
positions chrX:2000000-3000000 for modelling sequence
conservation. The same MSA was also analysed with the
Chai algorithm to obtain a profile of protein binding
affinity based on local DNA topology [64]. Finally,
regions selected as candidates to include functional regulatory elements were scanned for the presence of insect
transcription factor binding site profiles contained in
TRANSFAC [65] and JASPAR [66] collections.
Amino acid sequence analyses

For protein sequence analyses, we built two different
MSA. The first (Additional file 4) included all bilaterian
members of the Frequenin subfamily retrieved from
databases and was used to analyze amino acid co-evolution by means of two approaches. In one of them, the
correlated variance of the evolutionary rates between
amino acid sites was calculated in CAPS software [67].
In the other, a ML approach [18] based in a continuous
time Markov substitution process (CTMP) was applied

Sánchez-Gracia et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:54
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/54

to the data. This method compares the goodness of fit
of a null model, in which each pair of sites evolves independently, and an alternative coevolving model obtained
by reweighing the independent substitution rate matrix
to favour double over single changes. For this analysis,
we used a ε value of 0.75 and only the positions with a
log-odds score threshold > 15 were considered. The second protein MSA, with only vertebrate sequences but
with representatives of the entire NCS family, was used
to identify the amino acid positions with significant
shifts in substitution rates, likely responsible for changes
in functional constrains and functional diversification
between NCS subfamilies. We analyzed only vertebrate
sequences to avoid large unbalanced trees (i.e., only vertebrates have representatives of all NCS subfamilies),
which can produce biased results [19]. We discarded
sequences representing species or lineage specific expansions, which likely reflect particular histories, partial
sequences and sequences that produce poor aligned
fragments (Additional file 5). Type I and type II functional divergence coefficients [68,19] as well as the posterior probability (PP) profiles to contribute to
functional divergence of all amino acid sites were calculated in Diverge 2.0 software [69]. ML trees for these
analyses were built in PhyML [70] using the best-fit
amino acid substitution model selected in MODELTEST
3.7 [71]. Sites with the 5% highest PP values were considered as firm candidates to be functionally diverged
sites. Functional divergence between KChIP and GCAP
subfamilies was not analyzed because of the high level
of divergence and the poor quality of the alignment.
Neurocalcin-δ and VILIP1 subfamilies were not used
for this analysis because of their lack of amino acid rate
heterogeneity. The probability of observing a given distribution of amino acid changes between paralogues
after gene duplication was calculated with the Relative
Rate Test module implemented in Hyphy package [72].
This test was performed using the previously selected
amino acid substitution model.
The putative 3D structure of the ancestral Frequenin
(inferred by ML ancestral reconstruction in PAML 4)
was obtained with Swiss-Model server [73]. The 3D
structure of human Frequenin (PDB ID: 1G8I) [74,75]
was used as template for this analysis. The model was
visualized in Swiss-PdbViewer program version 4 [76].
This program was also used to highlight the relevant
amino acid replacements identified in the evolutionary
analyses.
