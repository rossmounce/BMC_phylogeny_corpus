A new family of phosphoinositide phosphatases
in microorganisms: identification and biochemical
analysis

Abstract
Background: Phosphoinositide metabolism is essential to membrane dynamics and impinges on many cellular
processes, including phagocytosis. Modulation of phosphoinositide metabolism is important for pathogenicity and
virulence of many human pathogens, allowing them to survive and replicate in the host cells. Phosphoinositide
phosphatases from bacterial pathogens are therefore key players in this modulation and constitute attractive
targets for chemotherapy. MptpB, a virulence factor from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, has phosphoinositide
phosphatase activity and a distinct active site P-loop signature HCXXGKDR that shares characteristics with
eukaryotic lipid phosphatases and protein tyrosine phosphatases. We used this P-loop signature as a “diagnostic
motif” to identify related putative phosphatases with phosphoinositide activity in other organisms.
Results: We found more than 200 uncharacterised putative phosphatase sequences with the conserved signature
in bacteria, with some related examples in fungi and protozoa. Many of the sequences identified belong to
recognised human pathogens. Interestingly, no homologues were found in any other organisms including Archaea,
plants, or animals. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that these proteins are unrelated to classic eukaryotic lipid
phosphatases. However, biochemical characterisation of those from Listeria monocytogenes and Leishmania major,
demonstrated that, like MptpB, they have phosphatase activity towards phosphoinositides. Mutagenesis studies
established that the conserved Asp and Lys in the P-loop signature (HCXXGKDR) are important in catalysis and
substrate binding respectively. Furthermore, we provide experimental evidence that the number of basic residues
in the P-loop is critical in determining activity towards poly-phosphoinositides.
Conclusion: This new family of enzymes in microorganisms shows distinct sequence and biochemical
characteristics to classic eukaryotic lipid phosphatases and they have no homologues in humans. This study
provides a foundation for examining the biological role of this new family of phosphatases and their potential as
pharmaceutical targets against infectious diseases.

Background
Phosphatidylinositols are important metabolites present
in animal cell membranes. They can be phosphorylated
at three main positions of the inositol head (D-3, 4, and
5) to generate seven different phosphoinositides (PIs).
Their metabolism is tightly controlled by phospholipases
that in some instances generate second messengers such
as inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). In addition, kinases and phosphatases
control the levels of the mono, di- or tri-phosphorylated

forms [1-5]. PI phosphatases belong to different families
of enzymes; PTEN and myotubularin inositol 3-phosphatases (3-ptases) belong to the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) superfamily and have both protein and
lipid phosphatase activities [6,7]. Inositol 4-phosphatases
(4-ptases), share with PTPs the conserved active site signature CX 5 R (P-loop motif) where the Cys is the
nucleophile in catalysis and Arg binds the phosphate
group in the substrate. The inositol 5-phosphatases
(5-ptases) are Mg2+-dependent enzymes related to endonucleases (reviewed in [6,7]).
PIs are implicated in the regulation of a wide variety
of cellular functions, including signal transduction,

membrane dynamics, cytoskeleton arrangements, endocytosis, endosome trafficking, permeability and transport
across membranes [1,3]. PIs are also important in facilitating phagocytosis of pathogenic bacteria and the subsequent phagosomal maturation leading to bacteria
decay. This process is mediated by PI(3)P and PI(3,5)P2
[4]. Pathogenic bacteria have evolved sophisticated strategies to escape the innate immune response, using PI
metabolising proteins such as phosphatases and kinases
to block phagosome maturation. Some of these bacterial
phosphatases like SigD/SopB, IpgD and SapM have
phosphoinositide activity resulting in the alteration of PI
levels in the host membranes [8-10].
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is an exceptionally
successful pathogen that is able to survive in the host
for a lifetime. Mtb enters macrophages in a phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) dependent manner and uses lipid
analogues (LAM) [11] and PI metabolising enzymes
(SapM [12]) to keep low levels of PI(3)P that prevent
recruitment of Rab7 and phagosomal maturation.
MptpB is a secreted phosphatase [13] critical for Mtb
survival in host cells [14]. We have recently shown that
it has protein and PI phosphatase activity [15] and could
act together with SapM to control PI(3)P levels in the
host.
MptpB has a unique active site P-loop motif (160-167):
HCFAGKDR, which is strictly conserved in other mycobacterial species, where the Asp165 is an essential catalytic residue and Lys164 is important for PI binding [15].
This signature shares similarities with that of eukaryotic
3-ptases myotubularin (MTM), HCSDGWDR, and
PTEN, HCKAGKGR, despite a low overall sequence
homology (10.6% for MTMR2 and 9.8% for PTEN). The
MTM/PTEN family of 3-ptases is conserved in mammals,
Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis thaliana, yeast, kinetoplastids and several protozoa
[16-20]. However, homologous 3-ptases have not been
identified in bacteria. Instead, some pathogenic bacteria
have multifunctional 5-ptases such as SopB from Salmonella and IpgD from Shigella [21]. The P-loop features
and catalytic profile of MptpB, together with the lack of
MTM and PTEN orthologues in bacteria suggested that
MptpB like phosphatases may constitute an alternative
type of PI phosphatase in prokaryotes. This hypothesis
prompted us to further investigate the existence of
MptpB related protein sequences in other organisms.
In this study, bioinformatics explorations revealed a
large family of MptpB related sequences present mostly
in bacteria, with some in fungi and protozoa. Several of
the sequences identified are found in recognised intracellular pathogens. No MptpB homologues were found in
Archaea, plants or animals. We characterised biochemically, selected proteins from different organisms (two
bacterial and one from a protozoa) and confirmed that

Page 2 of 12

they have phosphatase activity towards both phosphorylated peptides and PIs. Mutagenesis of conserved P-loop
residues confirmed a Cys based mechanism of catalysis,
where the conserved Asp is an essential catalytic residue.
Furthermore, we provide evidence for the importance of
key residues in the P-loop as determinants in PI substrate
specificity. Substitution of P-loop residues to mimic that
of eukaryotic 3-ptases, resulted in mutant enzymes with
enhanced phosphatase activity and new poly-phosphate
PI specificity.
Phylogenetic analysis shows that this new family of PI
phosphatases is not related to the classic eukaryotic lipid
phosphatases like MTMs/PTEN. Moreover, these phosphatases exhibit distinct and unusual features in their
catalytic profile, sequence and domain organisation to
other known PI and inositol phosphatases, for which we
designated them as atypical lipid phosphatases (ALPs).

Results
Bioinformatics analysis reveals a large family of MptpB
related sequences

Initial sequence homology searches were done using the
full-length MptpB sequence. These searches found 81
protein sequences in bacteria and one single sequence
from fungi (Coprinopsis cinerea okayama) (Table 1). No
sequences were found in Archaea, plants or animals.
Some bacterial species contained more than one gene,
like Listeria monocytogenes, Lactobacillus brevis and
Rhodopseudomonas palustris. These 81 proteins are still
uncharacterised functionally and one third of them are
annotated as hypothetical proteins. The remaining are

annotated as dual-specificity phosphatases (DSPs) (41%)
or PTPs (21%) based on the presence of the CX 5 R
motif, although there is not experimental evidence in
the literature to support this assignment.
Sequences were identified in both Gram positive (48%)
and Gram negative (51%) bacteria. The MptpB P-loop
signature is conserved in all sequences, except 7, of
which the Cys residue is absent in 3 sequences (2 from
Burkholderia phytofirmans and 1 from Mycobacterium
paratuberculosis) and the Asp residue is absent in 4
sequences (Bacteroides ovatus, Bacteroides uniformis,
Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron). As
both residues are important for catalysis [15] these 7
sequences are probably inactive phosphatases and were
excluded in subsequent analyses.
A multiple sequence alignment of the bacterial ALPs,
highlights five main regions of conservation in the
family (C1-C5 in Figure 1 and additional file 1). The
active site region shows the highest conservation, with
the P-loop: HCXXGKDR[TA]G, and a contiguous
extended signature, reminiscent of that found in DSPs
[22] (C4 in Figure 1). The P-loop motif is the landmark
feature of this family of sequences and retains the unusual composition found in MptpB with the strictly conserved Lys and Asp, suggesting likely similarities in
catalytic activity. The four additional regions, C1-C3 and
C5, show good conservation (30-55%) with some residues showing greater than 50% conservation, in agreement with those regions forming part of the main
structural core of the phosphatase domain. Although
the P-loop shares the CX5R signature with PTPs, other

Page 3 of 12

key functional motifs in PTPs are not present in the
ALPs sequences. These include the WPD motif, which
contains the catalytic Asp in PTPs, the KNRY motif
(pTyr binding motif) and the Q-loop, characteristic of
tyrosine specific phosphatases [23]. The absence of the
WPD loop suggests that an alternative Asp residue in
ALPs may function as the cognate general acid in the
dephosphorylation reaction. The most likely candidate is
the conserved Asp in the P-loop, which is a catalytic
residue in MptpB [15]
The alignment of ALPs highlighted that mycobacterial
sequences contain two unique insertions flanking the
active site motif: insertion 1 (residues 85-117 in MptpB)
and insertion 2 (197-235 in MptpB) (Figure 1 and Figure
2A). In M. tuberculosis and M. bovis there is a single
residue alteration in insertion 1, while the corresponding
region in other mycobacterial species is also unique but
unrelated. Insertion 2 also has deviations between
M. tuberculosis and M. bovis sequences and the remaining mycobacterial sequences. These insertions appear to
be important for functional regulation of MptpB as suggested from the crystallographic structures. Insertion 2
forms a lid that covers the active site and could control
substrate access (Figure 2A) [24], and insertion 1
changes conformation upon ligand binding [25].
Another distinct structural feature of MptpB is an alpha
helix in the conserved motif C3 (Figure 2A), which is
not present in the structures of PTPs (including human
PTP1B) or DSPs. This helix provides a secondary binding pocket for inhibitory compounds [25,26] and may be
important in conferring selectivity. The C3 motif is

representative sequence from each group in the phylogenetic tree and the sequences of the proteins characterised biochemically in this study,
Lm800, Lm1935 and LM1 (the complete alignment is in the Additional file 1). The alignment highlights that the sequences are highly divergent
except from the phosphate-binding loop (P-loop) in the active site region with an extended signature (C4). There are additional regions of high
conservation (labelled C1-C5). Insertions 1 and 2 are unique to the mycobacteria sequences. Alignment prepared using ClustalX [35].

organisation in lipid phosphatases. PTEN and MTM type lipid phosphatases have a phosphatase PTP domain and additional lipid binding
domains like PH-GRAM, C2, FYVE that exert allosteric control and anchor the PTP domain to different membrane locations. ALP and PFA lipid
phosphatases lack the classic lipid binding domains, only Lmo1800 contains a predicted lipid attachment sequence.

relatively conserved in the ALP family with a high proportion of basic and acidic residues throughout, suggesting a good potential for helical content in this region.
The domain organisation of this new family shows a
main difference with other eukaryotic lipid phosphatases, which generally contain a number of characteristic
modules for membrane targeting and lipid binding (PH,
C2, GRAM, FYVE). In contrast, ALPs contain the phosphatase domain only and lack any classic lipid binding
modules (Figure 2B), suggesting that they use alternative
mechanisms for lipid binding and membrane anchoring,
maybe mediated by effector proteins.

Phylogenetic analysis of MptpB related sequences

The occurrence of one single eukaryotic sequence in the
blast search was intriguing, but the high conservation of
the P-loop motif, suggested that perhaps other eukaryotic sequences may still retain this signature albeit with a
low overall homology for the rest of the sequence. To
test this, we carried out a ScanProsite search using the
active site motif “HCXXGKDR”. The search returned a
total of 209 sequences, of which 163 were bacterial and
46 were from lower eukaryotes (Table 1). The majority
of eukaryotic sequences identified were fungi (40), with
4 Leishmania sequences (2 L. infantum and 2 L. major),

Beresford et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:457
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/457

1 sequence from Caenorhabditis elegans and 1 sequence
from Trichomonas vaginalis. A total of 31% of the
sequences identified in ScanProsite were also present in
the Blast hit list, indicating that in the remaining
sequences the overall sequence identity was less than
30% to MptpB. Interestingly, more than 30 sequences of
the total list belong to pathogens.
Other known bacterial lipid and inositol phosphatase
sequences were missing from our hit list. This is the
case of SopB/SigD and IpgD, with a slight different
motif: NCKSGKDR, and low sequence identity to
MptpB (~11%). Also absent are the mammalian 4-ptases
(with the motif XCKSAKDR) and 5-ptases that lack the
CX5R consensus motif.
A phylogenetic tree was compiled using the bacterial
ALP sequences from the Blast search together with
eukaryotic sequences from the ScanProsite motif search,
the phosphatase domain of classical eukaryotic lipid
phosphatases (MTM, PTEN) and the recently reported
PIP3 phosphatases from plants and kinetoplastids PFAs
[27]. The analysis identified eleven clusters (Figure 3
and Additional file 2), with MTMs, PTEN sequences
(dark blue in Figure 3) and PFAs, (cyan in Figure 3)
clustering independently from the ALP sequences. The
bacterial and eukaryotic ALPs form separate clusters
with bacterial sequences in groups 1-6 (red in Figure 3)
and eukaryotic sequences in groups 7-9 (green in Figure
3). All mycobacterial sequences cluster together in
group 1 reflecting a highest homology within this subgroup. Gram positive (groups 1 and 3) and Gram negative (groups 2, 5, 6) bacteria group separately with the
exception of group 4, which contains a mix of Gram
positive and negative bacteria. Group 8 is formed by
yeast species, while the other groups contained a mix of
species. Only Aspergillus nidulans has sequences in different groups (group 7 and group 9). A number of
sequences fail to cluster into any group (black in Figure
3), but remain independent of classic eukaryotic lipid
phosphatases and PFAs. Overall the phylogenetic tree
emphasises the diversity of the APL sequences with
clear separation between the bacterial and fungal/protozoan clusters and confirms that none of them are closely
related to classical eukaryotic 3-ptases typified by MTMs
and PTEN.
MptpB related sequences exhibit both protein
phosphatase and lipid phosphatase activity

We previously reported that MptpB had both protein
phosphatase and lipid phosphatase activity. We also
established that Cys160, Lys164, Asp165 and Arg166 in
the P-loop, are important residues involved in catalysis
or substrate binding [15]. The conservation of these
residues in the ALP sequences, suggested they could
have a similar enzymatic profile, which could be relevant

Page 5 of 12

to PI metabolism. To test this hypothesis, two prokaryotic sequences and one eukaryotic sequence from our hit
list were selected for enzymatic analysis, all of them
belonging to intracellular pathogens; Lmo1800 and
Lmo1935 from L. monocytogenes and LM1 from
L. major. These sequences occupy different locations
within the phylogenetic tree (Figure 3) and had
sequence identities of only 22-24% to MptpB. Despite
their relatively poor sequence homology the P-loop
motif is almost identical to MptpB with only one substitution of F for T in position two.
Biochemical analyses confirmed that all three proteins
had phosphatase activity, with the ability to dephosphorylate the generic phosphatase substrate pNPP. Lmo1800
shows the highest specific activity (SA) of 63.4 nmoles
min-1 mg-1, followed by Lmo1935 of 57.5 nmoles min-1
mg-1 and LM1 of 45.5 nmoles min-1 mg-1, comparable
to MptpB of 46.9 nmoles min-1 mg -1 and the control
protein phosphatase, TbPTP1, 53.8 nmoles min-1 mg-1.
In addition, they all dephosphorylate p-Tyr peptides,
with Lmo1800 showing the greatest SA of 49.4 nmoles
min -1 mg -1 , whilst LM1 showed considerably lower
activity, 12.1 nmoles min -1 mg -1 (Figure 4A). Dephosphorylation of p-Ser and p-Thr peptides was significantly lower for all phosphatases, with MptpB having
the highest SA of 2.82 nmoles min-1 mg-1, and LM1 the
lowest at 0.58 nmoles min -1 mg -1 (Figure 4A). The
dephosphorylation ratio of pY: pS/T peptides for MptpB
and Lmo1935 is 11 : 1 and 16 : 1, respectively, comparable to the DSPs such as VHR (2.9 : 1), in contrast to
Tyr specific PTPs like hPTP1B that show a ratio greater
than 1.48 × 105 : 1 [28]. Based on the results it appears
that Lmo1800 and LM1 have a stronger preference for
p-Tyr peptides while Lmo1935 exhibits a similar activity
profile for the phospho-peptides to MptpB.
We further tested if these proteins had phosphatase
activity towards PIs, as the P-loop signature seem to
predict. We tested all seven PI forms and we found that
the control protein tyrosine phosphatase, TbPTP1, had
little activity of towards any of the PIs (< 2.6 nmoles
min-1 mg-1). Lmo1800 exhibited high activity towards PI
(3,5)P2 (50.8 nmoles min-1 mg-1) and mono-phosphate
PIs PI(3)P (41.9 nmoles min -1 mg -1 ), PI(4)P (26.1
nmoles min-1 mg-1) and PI(5)P (48.6 nmoles min-1 mg1
), with no detectable activity towards the remaining PIs
(Figure 4B). Both Lmo1935 and LM1 show also activity
towards mono-phosphorylated PIs (ranging from 4.9-5.8
nmoles min -1 mg -1 and 8.2-10.9 nmoles min -1 mg -1 ,
respectively) but not for PI(3,5)P2 (Figure 4B). Although
the activity of LM1 towards PIs is lower than MptpB, it
was of a similar magnitude to p-Tyr peptides indicating
no preferred substrate. This is in contrast to Lmo1935,
which has a stronger preference for peptide substrates
(7-fold increase). None of the phosphatases were able to

dephosphorylate contiguous di-phosphate PIs: PI(3,4)P2,
PI(4,5)P2 and the tri-phosphate PI(3,4,5)P3, showing a
similar catalytic profile to MptpB [15]. Other phosphoester substrates were tested and confirmed the preference
of MptpB and Lmo1800 for the p-Tyr amino acid over
p-Ser and p-Thr and showed modest activity for 5′AMP
and 5′IMP (Table 2).
P-loop composition in lipid phosphatases: identification
of determinants for substrate specificity

Comparison of the P-loop composition between different PI phosphatases reveals two distinct groups. Group
1, with PTEN, Arabidopsis thaliana PFA (At-PFA), 4ptases and SopB/IgpD, which have three or more basic
residues, and group 2, with MptpB, MTMs, Lmo1800
and LM1, that have only one or two basic residues and
the conserved catalytic Asp in position six (Figure 5A).
All of them, except MTMs, have a conserved Lys residue in position 5, important in substrate binding

[15,29]. Group 1 enzymes have an additional Lys in
position 2, which appears to correlate with the ability to
dephosphorylate PI(3,4,5)P3 and poly-phosphoinositols.
Group 2 enzymes lack this extra Lys and are unable to
dephosphorylate PI(3,4,5)P3 and most di-phosphorylated
PIs, favouring instead mono-phosphorylated PI substrates [15,30]. The absence of this extra basic residue,
presumably important to compensate for additional
negative charge in poly-phosphate substrates, may
account for the lack of activity towards those PIs in
group 2. To test this hypothesis and to corroborate the
functional role of the conserved Lys and Asp at positions 5 and 6 we produced a number of P-loop single
mutants. We previously established the function of
Asp165 in MptpB as an essential residue in catalysis
[15]. Mutagenesis of the homologue Asp residue
(Asp194 and Asp152) in Lmo1800 and LM1 to Ala
resulted in a significant loss in activity, with < 10% of
WT activity (Figure 5B).

Another residue in the P-loop, Lys164 in MptpB, is
involved in substrate binding and particularly important
for dephosphorylation of PI(3,5)P2 [15]. Mutation of the
cognates Lmo1800-Lys193 and LM1-Lys151 to Ala
resulted in a significant loss in activity towards PI(3,5)
P2 but retained 10% of the WT activity for PI(3)P
(Figure 5B).
Having established the importance of residues in position 5 and 6, we then wanted to explore the importance
of Lys in position 2 in substrate specificity. We mutated
position 2 residues in MptpB and related enzymes to
Lys to see if we could convert a group 2 lipid phosphatase into a group 1 phosphatase with similar substrate
specificity. We found that in MptpB, the residue in position 2, Phe161, when mutated to Lys, results in an
mutant enzyme with new activity for di-phosphorylated
substrates PI(3,4)P2 (8.5 nmoles min-1 mg-1) and PI(4,5)
P2 (7.0 nmoles min -1 mg -1 ) and even shows activity
towards the tri-phosphorylated PI(3,4,5)P3 (2.2 nmoles
min-1 mg-1) (Figure 5B). Note that the WT enzyme does
not dephosphorylate any of these substrates.
Mutation of the equivalent position in Lmo1800
(Thr190) to Lys resulted in increased dephosphorylation
of PI(3)P (1.4-fold), a 3-fold increase of activity towards
and PI(3,5)P2 with low activity for PI(3,4)P2 (0.2 nmoles
min-1 mg-1). For LM1, mutation of Thr148 to Lys, also
shows an increase (1.5-fold) in activity for PI(3)P but
not towards di- or tri-phosphorylated PIs, suggesting
that other factors and possibly conformational arrangements in the active site of Lmo1800 and LM1 determine
substrate preference.

Discussion
In this study, we have used the P-loop signature of the
bacterial lipid phosphatase MptpB as a “diagnostic
motif” to identify related putative lipid phosphatases.
We found a whole new family of predicted phosphatases

in bacteria, with some instances in fungi and protozoa.
Interestingly, no homologues were found in other
organisms such as Archaea, plants or animals. These
proteins have not previously been characterised functionally and at least one third of them are not annotated. The existence of such a large family of putative
lipid phosphatases in bacteria is unexpected. Very few
bacteria, with the exception of actinobacteria, produce
inositols or phosphoinositides, therefore they generally
lack the enzymes involved in inositol metabolism [31].
On the other hand, some pathogenic bacteria secrete PI
metabolising enzymes, like kinases and phosphatases,
that they use to subvert PI signalling in the host cells,
promoting virulence and survival in the infected cells
[9,10]. Although the biological role of the ALPs identified in this study remains unknown, it is interesting to
note that many of the sequences belong to pathogenic
microorganisms, such as Listeria, Yersinia, Klebsiella,
Clostridium, Leishmania, Candida, and Aspergillus.
Phylogenetic analysis showed a number of clusters,
distinct for the bacterial and fungal/protozoan species,
and that ALPs are clearly different to classic mammalian
lipid 3-ptases, MTMs and PTEN or the PFAs. Additionally, ALPs lack the typical lipid anchoring domains commonly found in mammalian lipid phosphatases.
Biochemical characterisation of selected sequences
from the intracellular pathogens L. monocytogenes and
L. major, confirmed our prediction that these are active
phosphatases, able to dephosphorylate phosphoinositides. A broader PI activity in ALPs is also in contrast
with the more restrictive specificity observed in MTMs/
PTEN 3-ptases and the capability to dephosphorylate
di- and tri-phosphoinositides found in the SopB/IpgD
5-ptases.
Clear differences were observed in the activity profile
between the two proteins in L. monocytogenes, Lmo1800
and Lmo1935. While Lmo1935 has preference for

activity. Two groups of lipid phosphatases can be assigned based
on the different amino acid composition of the active site P-loop.
Group 1 contains 3 or more basic residues and a conserved K in
position two, while Group 2 have 1 or 2 basic residues and none in
position 2. B. Effect of mutagenesis of P-loop residues on the

peptide substrates, Lmo1800 exhibits a similar activity
profile as MptpB, with DSP activity and broad PI specificity. This suggests that the two Lmo proteins could
have distinct functional roles and provides an explanation for the presence of the two genes in Listeria.
The catalytic function of critical P-loop residues in
classic eukaryotic lipid phosphatases has previously been

Page 9 of 12

determined. In MTMs, position 6 in the P-loop is occupied by an Asp residue (HCSDGWDR), which functions
as the general acid in catalysis [32]. Similar findings
were reported for MptpB [15]. Here we established the
importance of the conserved Asp in the ALP proteins as
mutation to Ala results in mutant enzymes with compromised activity, suggesting a similar role of this residue in catalysis as shown for MptpB and MTMs.
In PTEN, the presence of several basic residues
(HCKAGKGR) facilitates the binding of highly negatively charged PI substrates and in particular of PI(3,4,5)
P3, its preferred substrate [29]. A similar motif,
CKSXKDR, is also found in SopB/IpgD inositol and
mammalian 4-ptases that have a preference for polyphosphate PIs. However, ALPs, contain only two basic
residues (Lys and Arg) in the P-loop and they dephosphorylate preferably mono-phosphoralyted PIs with no
activity towards PI(3,4,5)P3. Here we have shown that
firstly, the conserved Lys in position 5 of the P-loop is
important for efficient dephosphorylation of PI(3,5)P2,
and probably involved in substrate binding, consistent
with the proposed role of the cognate Lys164 in MptpB
[15] and Lys128 in PTEN [29]. Secondly, we showed
that the number of basic residues is critical to dephosphorylate poly-phosphate PIs. We mutated the residues
in position 2 of the P-loop to Lys to mimic the extra
basic residue in PTEN and SopB. Mutation of Phe161 in
MptpB, Thr190 in Lmo1800 and Thr148 in LM1 to Lys
resulted in enhanced activity towards mono- and diphospho PIs in Lmo1800, and MptpB, and new activity
towards PI(3,4,5)P3 for MptpB (Figure 5B). This is an
important finding as, historically, the role of P-loop residues has been restricted to enzyme catalysis and catalytic efficiency. In this study we demonstrate that single
amino acid substitutions can result in subtle changes in
substrate preferences and supports the notion that the
active site loop sequence can be used as diagnostic of
substrate specificity. New insights regarding the structural constrains that determine substrate binding in this
new family of phosphatases should be revealed when the
three-dimensional structures are determined.

Conclusions
Overall, this new family of enzymes shows both distinct
sequence features and biochemical characteristics. ALPs
have a unique P-loop signature and exhibit broad PI specificity. In addition, they have low sequence homology
and different domain organisation to classic lipid phosphatases. The biological role of these proteins remains to
be elucidated, but their potential role in PI metabolism
suggests interesting links with established mechanisms of
pathogenesis in other microorganisms such as M. tuberculosis, Leishmania, Listeria, Salmonella, and Shigella

[9,33], and a potential to be exploited as targets in antiinfective treatments given their low homology to any
other human phosphatases.

Methods
Bioinformatics analyses

Two approaches were taken to identify MptpB related
sequences, a) Blast searches [34] of SwissProt and
TrEMBL using the full length sequence of MptpB and b)
ScanProsite search of SwissProt and TrEMBL http://
www.expasy.ch/tools/scanprosite using the signature
motif “HCXXGKDR”. In the Blast searches the sequences
selected had E-values between 10 -11 and 10 -131 (> 30%
sequence identity). Multiple sequence alignments of
MptpB-related phosphatases were performed using ClustalX [35] and manually edited using the programs BioEdit
(Hall T: Bioedit http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/bioedit.html) and Cinema [36]. Phylogenetic trees were calculated using a maximum likelihood program, RAxML [37],
with a 100 bootstrap replicates. Trees were produced
using the program Treeview [38]. Analysis of the domain
architecture was preformed using InterProScan [39] and
SMART databases [40].
Over-expression and purification of recombinant proteins

All the proteins used in the biochemical characterisation
were produced in E.coli as recombinant proteins as
described below:
MptpB

The open reading frame of Rv0153c, encoding MptpB,
was amplified from M. tuberculosis H37Rv DNA and
cloned into a pET28a vector (Novagen) to generate an
N-terminal His6-tagged expression construct. Site directed mutagenesis of the following residues; F161A,
F161K, K164A and D165N were carried out using the
QuikChange kit (Stratagene). Each construct (WT and
mutants) were transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) and
expression was induced using an auto-induction method
at 25°C for 16 h [41]. His-tagged MptpB WT and
mutants was purified by standard nickel affinity chromatography on a 5 ml HiTrap column (Amersham
Bioscience) in binding buffer (50 mM Hepes, 500 mM
NaCl, pH 7) and eluted 300 mM imidazole.

expressed using an auto-induction method at 25°C for
16 h [41]. The expressed GST-Lmo1800 and GSTLmo1935 were purified by glutathione sepharose affinity chromatography. The supernatant from the bacterial lysate was loaded onto a 1 ml GST Trap HP
column (GE Healthcare) in binding buffer (50 mM
Hepes, 500 mM NaCl, pH 7) and the protein was
recovered following on-column cleavage of the GSTtag with PreScission protease (GE Healthcare). For
Initial activity assays we used tag-less proteins
(Lmo1800 WT and Lmo1935 WT) against phosphopeptides and PIs. Subsequent assays used GST-tag proteins (WT and mutants of Lmo1800 and Lmo1935)
following elution with 10 mM glutathione of the glutathione sepharose column. No significant differences
in activity were observed for the fusion proteins.
LM1

The Leishmania major LmjF22.0250 (SP code Q4QBX1)
initial pET14 construct was a kind gift from Wesley Van
Voorhis, Fred Buckner and Erin Quartley of the Structural Genomics of Pathogenic Protozoa consortium.
This construct contained a frame shift, which was subsequently removed by site directed mutagenesis. Site
directed mutagenesis of the following residues; T148K,
K151A and D152A were carried out using QuikChange.
Each construct (WT and mutants) were transformed
into E. coli BL21 (DE3) and expression was induced
using an auto-induction method at 25°C for 16 h [41].
The expressed His6-LM1 WT and mutants were purified
by nickel affinity chromatography. The supernatant from
the bacterial lysate was loaded onto a 1 ml HiTrap column (Amersham Bioscience) in binding buffer (50 mM
Hepes, 500 mM NaCl, pH 7) and the protein was eluted
with 300 mM imidazole.
TbPTP1

TbPTP1 was amplified from T. brucei DNA and cloned
into pET28a (Novagen) as previously reported [42,15].
Recombinant TbPTP1 was expressed in E. coli strain
BL21 DE3 Codon+ RIPL, grown in LB broth at 37°C
and induced at 30°C with 0.4 mM IPTG. Purification of
His-tagged TbPTP1 was performed by nickel affinity
chromatography using the same method as for MptpB.

Lmo1800 and Lmo1935

Phosphatase activity assays

The open reading frame of Lmo1800 and Lmo1935,
encoding Lmo1800 and Lmo1935 respectively, was
amplified from Listeria monocytogenes EGD-e DNA
and cloned into pGEX-6P-1 (GE Healthcare) to generate an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST)
tagged expression construct. Site directed mutagenesis
of the following residues; T190K, K193A and D194A
(for Lmo1800) and D220A for Lmo1935 were carried
out using QuikChange. Each construct (WT and
mutants) was transformed into E. coli BL21 and

The malachite green assay [43] was used to determine
the amount of free phosphate during the dephosphorylation assays with a range of substrates: phospho-Tyr peptides from EGFR (DADEpYLIPQQG) and insulin
receptor (TRDIpYETDYYRK), phospho-Ser peptide
(RRApSVA), phospho-Thr peptide (KRpTIRR) (Alta
Bioscience, University of Birmingham, http://www.altabioscience.bham.ac.uk), pNPP (Sigma), and the PIs
diC8-PI(3)P, diC8-PI(3,4)P2, diC8-PI(3,5)P2, diC8-PI(4)
P, diC8-PI(4,5)P2, diC8-PI(5)P and diC8-PI(3,4,5)P3

(Echelon Bioscience), phospho-amino acids, adenosine 5′
monophosphate, inosine 5′-monophosphophate, phosphorylcholine chloride, phosphorylethanolamine, glycerol 2-phosphate and sodium pyrophosphate (Sigma).
Each reaction was prepared in triplicates in a 96-well
microplate, containing 50 μl of reaction mix with 5 μg
enzyme (MptpB, Lmo1800, Lmo1935, LM1) or 20 μg
GST-Lmo enzymes in buffer (50 mM Tris, 50 mM BisTris, 100 mM sodium acetate, pH 6) and 100-125 μM
substrate. The reactions were incubated for 15 minutes
at 37°C prior to the addition of 50 μl malachite green
reagent (Sigma) and further incubated for 10 minutes at
room temperature. The absorbance was subsequently
read at 620 nm and the mean calculated. Control reactions containing no enzyme were included to measure
the background level of phosphate. A phosphate standard curve was produced using known amounts of
phosphate (25-3000 pmoles of Sigma phosphate standard solution). Experimental points were interpolated in
the standard curve to calculate the amount of phosphate
released, which was then used to calculate the specific
activity (SA, nmoles min-1 mg-1).
