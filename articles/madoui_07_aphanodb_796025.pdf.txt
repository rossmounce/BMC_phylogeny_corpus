Abstract
Background: The Oomycete genus Aphanomyces comprises devastating plant and animal
pathogens. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenicity of
Aphanomyces species. In this study, we report on the development of a public database called
AphanoDB which is dedicated to Aphanomyces genomic data. As a first step, a large collection of
Expressed Sequence Tags was obtained from the legume pathogen A. euteiches, which was then
processed and collected into AphanoDB.
Description: Two cDNA libraries of A. euteiches were created: one from mycelium growing on
synthetic medium and one from mycelium grown in contact to root tissues of the model legume
Medicago truncatula. From these libraries, 18,684 expressed sequence tags were obtained and
assembled into 7,977 unigenes which were compared to public databases for annotation. Queries
on AphanoDB allow the users to retrieve information for each unigene including similarity to
known protein sequences, protein domains and Gene Ontology classification. Statistical analysis of
EST frequency from the two different growth conditions was also added to the database.
Conclusion: AphanoDB is a public database with a user-friendly web interface. The sequence
report pages are the main web interface which provides all annotation details for each unigene.
These interactive sequence report pages are easily available through text, BLAST, Gene Ontology
and expression profile search utilities. AphanoDB is available from URL: http://
www.polebio.scsv.ups-tlse.fr/aphano/.

Background
Oomycetes form a phylogenetically distinct group of
eukaryotic microorganisms which includes plant and animal pathogens, that cause widespread damages of high
economical [1-3] and ecological impacts [4]. Pathogenic
oomycete species are found mainly in three orders, the
Pythiales, the Peronosporales and the Saprolegniales [5].

From recent studies on the phylogenic relationships
within oomycetes, it has been suggested that the ability to
infect plants appeared at least twice in the oomycete lineage, first in an ancient lineage which evolved into the
Pythiales (including Phytophthora and Pythium) and Peronosporales, and secondly in the Saprolegniales lineage
[6], which includes destructive animal pathogens such as

the fish pathogens Saprolegnia parasitica and Aphanomyces
piscida, and plant pathogens such as A. euteiches and A.
cochlioides. Among members of Oomycetes, Phytophthora
is the best studied genus and genomic resources are available for several species (cDNA libraries and/or complete
genome sequence) [7-11]. In contrast, few nucleic acid
sequences are available from species classified in the Saprolegniales, the main data consisting in a 1510 ESTs collection obtained from the fish pathogen S. parasitica [12].

laid onto a 2 day-old mycelium, and culture continued for
1 and 2 days. Before the mycelium harvesting, plants were
gently removed from the Petri dish to avoid any contamination of A. euteiches RNA with plant RNA.A. euteiches
mRNA extracts were pooled and cDNA generated as
described for the MYC library. A library of approximately
5 × 105 colony forming units was obtained. About 10,000
clones from each library were 5' end sequenced using T7
primer on ABI3730xl DNA Sequencers.

Recently, we have developed a pathosystem which consists of the model legume Medicago truncatula and the legume pathogen A. euteiches [13]. Up to now, no chemical
compound is able to protect efficiently against A. euteiches
and infested fields cannot be used any longer for legume
production during many years [14]. In order to get a better
knowledge of the A. euteiches-legume interaction and to
identify molecular targets for drug design, a genomic
approache was used. Two unidirectional cDNA libraries
from a A. euteiches strain ATCC201684 [15] were prepared: one from mycelium growing in a liquid medium
containing yeast extract and glucose (MYC library), and
one from mycelium in contact to M. truncatula root tissues
(INT library). The latter situation is a simplified model for
growth during pathogenesis. A total of 18,684 expressed
sequence tags (9,224 from MYC library and 9,460 from
INT library) were submitted to the EBI databank for accession number assignation and were assembled into 7,977
unigenes. Here we present a database named AphanoDB
in which all the data were structured. Users can retrieve
information using text searches or BLAST analyses. AphanoDB is currently the most extensive resource of Aphanomyces sequences and related annotations.

EST quality and assembling
The two libraries were processed together. All reads were
obtained using the Phred program [16]. Only reads with a
Phred value over 20 on 80% of the sequences and with a
length of over 100 bp were selected. MultiFASTA sequence
and quality files were generated and cleaned by vector and
adaptor trimming using crossmatch (Figure 1). After these
steps 18,684 high-quality sequences were obtained corresponding to 93% of the initial sequence set. These
sequences were assembled using the CAP3 program [17].
Minimum overlap length was set to 100 bp, minimum
identity percent to 97% and maximum gap length to 30
bp (-o 100 -p 97 -f 30). ESTs from the two libraries were
assembled to obtain 7,977 unigenes composed of 2,843
contigs and 5,134 singletons (Table 1). Consensus
sequences were renamed with a unique identifier with the
prefix 'Ae' for the species, 3 digits for the number of ESTs
included in the contig, the 2 letters 'AL' for the strain and
5 digits as individual number.

Construction and content
Preparation of cDNA libraries and sequencing
The MYC library (saprophytic library) was made with
total RNA isolated from mycelium after 5, 7 and 9 days of
growth in liquid YG medium (2.5% Yeast extract, 5% Glucose, w/v) at 23°C in the dark. Mycelia were frozen in liquid nitrogen and total RNA was extracted. RNAs of each
sample were mixed in equal amounts. mRNAs were purified using an Oligotex mRNA purification kit (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. A unidirectionnal library was constructed in
pSport1 plasmid using the Superscript Plasmid System for
cDNA Synthesis and Cloning (Invitrogen, USA). Plasmid
ligations were transferred by electroporation into E. coli
DH5α cells following the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen Life Technologies, CA, USA). A library of approximately 5 × 105 colony forming units was obtained.

The INT library (interaction library) was made with total
mRNAs purified from mycelium grown for 1 or 2 days on
M. truncatula roots. Roots of two week-old plants were

EST analysis and functional annotation
Assignment of putative functions was performed by running the BLASTX algorithm (release 2.2.14) [18], against
a local NCBI non-redundant (nr) protein database (5-172007 Version). 61% of the sequences showed similarity to
a protein sequence with an E-value ≤ 1e-10. To estimate
the level of contamination of A. euteiches ESTs with M.
truncatula cDNA sequences which might occur in the INT
library, the unigene sequences were compared to 270,000
M. truncatula ESTs deposited in the GenBank database
using the BLASTN algorithm. Only 11 unigenes showed a
high similarity (E value < 1e-100) to M. truncatula ESTs
and only two unigenes were composed of ESTs from the
INT library. However, these two sequences displayed a
higher similarity to Phytophthora sequences than to M.
truncatula sequences. From this analysis, it can be concluded that contamination of the INT library with M. truncatula cDNAs is very low if any. Sequences were compared
to proteome data from seven different fully sequenced
organisms using BLASTX algorithm, since parts of the proteome of these organisms are not present in the nr database. To facilitate comparative analyses between
oomycete species, A. euteiches sequences were compared
to the P. sojae and P. ramorum proteomes [8]. Since it has
been shown that oomycetes are phylogenetically related

selected since it has been suggested recently that apicomplexan parasites and oomycetes share common infection
strategies [22]. Finally, the proteome of Arabidopsis thaliana was also added to analysis.
Domain searches using InterProscan program (release
4.2) [23] were performed locally with HMM searches
against Pfam protein database (16.0) [24]. 45% of
sequences showed a known Pfam domain with an E-value
≤ 1e-5 (Table 1).
To classify the sequences according to the Gene Ontology
classification scheme [25], Pfam domains with InterPro
accession number were linked to GO molecular function,
biological process and cellular component terms using
the interpro2go file [26]. Finally, 42% of the sequences
were assigned to a GO molecular function term, 43% to a
biological process and 24% to a cellular component
(Table 2).

and consensus sequences. The dynamic structure enables
addition of new sequences of different oomycete species
and associated features. The database is available through
an Apache Web server running on Fedora core 6 Linux.
The web interface is based on the PHP, JavaScript and
HTML languages; it enables dynamic MySQL queries with
a user-friendly graphical interface.

Utility and discussion
User interface
AphanoDB provides a complete summary sheet containing all annotation results for each predicted unigene (Figure 2). The BLASTX results against the nr database, HMM
search results against Pfam database and the Gene Ontology assignments are displayed on this summary sheet.
BLASTX alignment details are also provided and will be
updated yearly. The summary sheet also contains the
sequence of the unigene, the link to the ESTs alignment,
to the Ace file and another link to a multiFASTA file of the
contig components.

KEGG metabolic pathway map links [30] were also added
to the database.
Repeat sequences were detected using RepeatMasker [31]
with default parameters in order to identify microsatellite
markers and result outputs were added to the database.
To estimate differences in gene expression levels between
the saprophytic and the pathogenic growth conditions, a
statistical analysis was performed based on EST frequency
in each library. We used the test described by Susko et al.
[32] to calculate the p-value and false discovery rate control (FDR) for multiple test correction [33] (false positive
rate is controlled at less than α = 0.05).
Database implementation
AphanoDB is a MySQL database containing features,
cleaned ESTs and deduced contigs. At the end of each step
of the AphanoDB pipeline, information was stored in the
related table and linked to the core tables containing EST

Users can query the database for a given sequence by providing its accession number, EST name or gene ID.
Searches on the Gene Ontology annotation are possible
with graphical bars representing GO subfamilies (Figure
2A). For the GO catalytic activity subfamilies, EC links
and KEGG metabolic pathway map links are provided.
Function searches are allowed by queries by InterPro or
Pfam domain names or accession numbers. BLASTX
results stored in the database can be queried using organism name or putative function (Figure 2B–C). Queries on
repeat sequence types and sizes are also available as well
as on expression profile in a specific growth condition. For
expression profiles, the output shows only significant
results with a P-value lower than the Benjamini and Hochberg cut-off [33]. Users can submit their own sequences
for BLAST searches against the A. euteiches sequences using
BLASTN, TBLASTN and TBLASTX. The BLAST output page
displays one summary sheet for each hit on the A.
euteiches sequences.
Utilities and extensions
AphanoDB provides molecular data about A. euteiches
transcripts. The database contains 18,684 high quality
sequences and allows direct applications for functional
and comparative genomic approaches. AphanoDB is constructed in such a way that it can absorb a large number of
additional sequences from other oomycete species, such
as S. parasitica, for which large scale cDNA sequencing
projects are under way.

Conclusion
AphanoDB represents a major contribution to assist
genomic studies on Oomycetes and other related organisms such as diatoms and brown algae. Addition of new

sequences from other Aphanomyces species and other Saprolegniales is planned in the near future. AphanoDB will
facilitate gene prediction and annotation for the future
whole genome sequencing of Saprolegniales species. AphanoDB contains cleaned, assembled and annotated ESTs
which will serve the oomycete research community. The
database provides comprehensive tools for comparative
approaches that might lead for example to leading to the
identification of pathogenicity factors.
