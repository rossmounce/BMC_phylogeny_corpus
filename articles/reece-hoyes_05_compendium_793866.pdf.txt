information

Conclusion: wTF2.0 provides a starting point to decipher the transcription regulatory networks
that control metazoan development and function.

interactions

Results: By computational searches and extensive manual curation, we have identified a
compendium of 934 transcription factor genes (referred to as wTF2.0). We find that manual
curation drastically reduces the number of both false positive and false negative transcription factor
predictions. We discuss how transcription factor splice variants and dimer formation may affect the
total number of functional transcription factors. In contrast to mouse transcription factor genes,
we find that C. elegans transcription factor genes do not undergo significantly more splicing than
other genes. This difference may contribute to differences in organism complexity. We identify
candidate redundant worm transcription factor genes and orthologous worm and human
transcription factor pairs. Finally, we discuss how wTF2.0 can be used together with physical
transcription factor clone resources to facilitate the systematic mapping of C. elegans transcription
regulatory networks.

Background: Transcription regulatory networks are composed of interactions between
transcription factors and their target genes. Whereas unicellular networks have been studied
extensively, metazoan transcription regulatory networks remain largely unexplored. Caenorhabditis
elegans provides a powerful model to study such metazoan networks because its genome is
completely sequenced and many functional genomic tools are available. While C. elegans gene
predictions have undergone continuous refinement, this is not true for the annotation of functional
transcription factors. The comprehensive identification of transcription factors is essential for the
systematic mapping of transcription regulatory networks because it enables the creation of physical
transcription factor resources that can be used in assays to map interactions between transcription
factors and their target genes.

Background

Metazoan genomes contain thousands of predicted proteincoding genes. During development, pathology, and in
response to environmental changes, each of these genes is
expressed in different cells, at different times and at different
levels. Spatial and temporal gene expression is controlled
transcriptionally through the action of regulatory transcription factors (TFs) [1,2]. Transcription of each gene can be upor down-regulated by TFs that bind to cis-regulatory DNA
elements. These elements include upstream elements located
in the proximal promoter, and enhancers or silencers that can
be located at a greater distance from the transcription start
site. Frequently, the expression level of a gene is the result of
a balance between transcription activation and repression
governed by multiple cis-regulatory elements and, hence,
multiple TFs. The combinatorial nature of gene transcription
provides an exquisite level of flexibility to regulate genome
expression.
The understanding of differential gene expression at a
genome-wide, or systems, level has been greatly facilitated by
the mapping and analysis of transcription regulatory networks (Figure 1) [3-5]. Such networks are composed of two
types of components, or nodes: the gene targets that are
subject to transcriptional control and the TF proteins that
execute transcriptional control. Whereas transcription
regulatory networks have been extensively studied in relatively simple unicellular systems, they remain largely unexplored in complex, metazoan systems.
The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a powerful model to
decipher metazoan transcription regulatory networks. The C.
elegans genome has been completely sequenced and is predicted to contain 19,735 protein-coding genes (WormBase
WS140)[6]. Several functional genomic resources enable the
systematic dissection of differential gene expression at a systems level and in a high-throughput manner. For instance,
microarrays are available to investigate temporal and, to a
certain extent, spatial gene expression levels [7-9]. In addition, C. elegans 'ORFeome' [10] and 'Promoterome' [11]
resources provide open reading frame (ORF) and promoter
clones, respectively. These clones can be used for a wide variety of experiments that aim to dissect transcription regulatory
networks (see below).
With seven years of progressive refinement of the genome
annotation since the publication of the genome sequence [1214], comprehensive predictions of protein-coding genes are
available. However, there is no up-to-date compendium of
predicted C. elegans TFs. Several lists of putative C. elegans
TFs have been generated previously (Table 1; we refer to this
combined set as wTF1.0 (worm transcription factors version
1.0)), but none of these are comprehensive or readily accessible. The earliest lists were created by scanning sequences of C.
elegans proteins, as predicted from the genome annotation,
for well-defined DNA binding domains: Hobert and Ruvkun

http://genomebiology.com/2005/6/13/R110

[15] focused on homeodomain, paired domain, T-box, basic
helix-loop-helix (bHLH), basic region leucine zipper (bZIP),
Fork Head, erythroblast transformation specific (ETS) and
nuclear hormone receptor (NHR) proteins; and Clarke and
Berg [16] focused on various zinc-finger proteins. For comparative genomic studies primarily focusing on Drosophila
melanogaster [17] or Arabidopsis thaliana [18], a list of predicted C. elegans proteins containing various DNA binding
domains was compiled. While several (sub)-families of C. elegans TFs have been studied in greater detail (for example,
bHLH [19], CUT homeodomain [20], and DM zinc-finger
[21]), the most recent list of "all C. elegans TFs" was compiled
five years ago when Riechmann and colleagues [18] scanned
WormPep 20 (19,101 proteins). During the past few years, the
creation of improved computational tools [13] and the completion of the C. briggsae genome sequence [14] have enabled
a great improvement in the annotation of the C. elegans
genome. Here, we used a combination of bioinformatics and
extensive manual curation to generate wTF2.0, a comprehensive compendium of predicted C. elegans TF genes. We discuss how wTF2.0 can be used together with physical
ORFeome and Promoterome clone resources to decipher
transcription regulatory networks that control metazoan differential gene expression at a systems level.

Results and discussion
TF predictions: Gene Ontology term-based searches
To identify a comprehensive compendium of predicted worm
TFs, we first interrogated WormBase version 140 (WS140)[6]
for proteins that possess domains annotated with one of the
following Gene Ontology (GO) terms: 'regulation of transcription, DNA-dependent', 'transcription factor activity', and
'DNA binding'. (WS140 is the most recent reference release of
WormBase that is permanently accessible.) We identified a
total of 930 proteins (Figure 2, Additional data file 1). Of
these, 232 were identified by all three GO terms, 368 by two
GO terms and 330 by only one GO term (Figure 3). We
observed that this collection of proteins not only contains predicted regulatory TFs, but also proteins that function in other
nuclear processes (for example, DNA replication and repair).
Moreover, it contains numerous false positive predictions
(for example, small GTP-binding proteins). We removed both
types of false positives (Figure 2, Additional data file 2). Next,
we examined each of the remaining proteins for the presence
of a predicted DNA binding domain either by visual inspection of the protein sequence (AT-hooks and C2H2 zinc-fingers), or using InterPro v10.0 (2005)[22], SMART [23] and
Pfam [24] databases (Additional data file 2). We found several proteins that, upon closer inspection, do not possess a
DNA binding domain despite their WormBase protein
domain annotation (Additional data file 2). For instance, several proteins were found that are annotated to be a NHR TF,
but that only contain a predicted ligand binding domain.
However, we retained proteins that do not have a clear DNA
binding domain but for which experimental evidence is avail-

included SKN-1, a bZIP protein known to bind DNA in a
sequence-specific manner [25]. In total, 369 proteins (40%)
were removed (Figure 2a, Additional data file 2). As expected,
combining all three GO terms was the most robust method for
identifying predicted TFs, as 96% of these proteins were
retained. The GO term DNA binding by itself was least robust
as only 16% of these were retained. However, this can readily
be explained by the retrieval of proteins that do bind DNA but
that are not involved in transcriptional regulation.

Upon examination of the remaining 561 proteins, we noticed
that several well known TF families were underrepresented
compared to wTF1.0, or even absent (for example, bHLH,
C2H2 zinc-fingers and MADF (Mothers Against Dpp Factor)). This suggests that the predictions based on GO annotations alone suffer from a high false negative rate. To address
this issue, we searched WormBase for each protein domain
known to be involved in sequence specific DNA binding
(Table 1). In addition, we added several TFs found by yeast
one-hybrid assays (for example, TFs containing RPEL and
FLYWCH domains [26] (data not shown)). We used visual
inspection (C2H2 zinc-fingers and AT-hooks), InterPro,
SMART and Pfam to verify these predictions and, in total,
added 369 additional, putative TFs to the compendium.
Finally, we added 4 proteins: 3 of which are homologs of
known mammalian TFs (BAR-1, HMP-2 and WRM-1,
homologs of mammalian β-catenin) and one that has been
described in the literature (SDC-2 [27]). In total, amongst the
19,735 predicted protein-coding genes, we identified 934 predicted C. elegans TF genes (Additional data file 1). Taken

together, the combination of computational queries and manual curation results in a comprehensive compendium of C.
elegans TF-encoding genes. We refer to this compendium as
wTF2.0.

TF families
Table 1 presents wTF2.0 grouped into TF families. Interestingly, 23 TFs contain DNA binding domains from different
families (Additional data file 3). Future studies will determine
if and how these domains function together in DNA binding
specificity and, consequently, target gene selection. Interestingly, most human orthologs of these TFs also contain multiple, distinct DNA binding domains (Additional data file 3),
indicating that the occurrence of multiple DNA binding
domains in a TF is not worm specific. Comparison of wTF2.0
to wTF1.0 revealed that, of 48 TF families, 23 are unique to
wTF2.0 (Table 1). This is likely because for the collective predictions in wTF1.0, only the major DNA binding domains
were included. In addition, some protein domains have only
recently been annotated to function in DNA-binding, including SAND [28], and THAP zinc-finger [29] domains. For several of the domains unique to wTF2.0 (CP2, WH-DAC, IPT/
TIG, TEA/ATTS, WT1, YL1), the genes encoding them were
not actually annotated until after WormPep 20 and could,
therefore, not have been included in the wTF1.0 collections.

wTF2.0 is a starting point to predict the actual number of
functional TF complexes. For instance, the number of active
TFs is likely greater than 934 because many TF genes encode
multiple proteins as a result of alternative transcripts. In
addition, many TFs function as heterodimers, with subunits
associating in different combinations. To date, 144 of the 934
predicted TF genes (15.4%) are known to undergo alternative
splicing (Additional data file 5). On average, each spliced TF
gene results in 3 different transcripts and the number of
splice variants per gene ranges from 2 to 13. Some alternative
transcripts do not result in the expression of a different TF
protein variant. In total, 379 alternative TF protein variants

are expressed from 144 genes, and the number of variant proteins per TF gene is between 2 and 10. Interestingly, 30 TF
variants, corresponding to 25 TF genes, no longer contain a
DNA binding domain. Rather than binding DNA and regulating target gene expression directly, these proteins may have
regulatory functions to control TF activity. Taken together,
alternative splicing yields 205 additional putative DNA binding TFs, bringing the total number of predicted C. elegans
TFs to 1,139. Interestingly, Taneri and colleagues [30]
observed that mouse TF genes are more likely to undergo
alternative splicing than other mouse genes (62% compared
to 29%). These alternatively spliced TF genes may yield functionally different TFs that may bind DNA with different specificities and affinities and, as a consequence, regulate
different sets of target genes. In contrast, the percentage of C.
elegans TF genes that undergo alternative splicing is only
slightly higher than the percentage of all protein-coding genes
that are alternatively spliced (15% versus 10%) [31] (this
study). This observation suggests that higher percentages of
TF gene splicing may contribute to increased organism complexity. Finally, it is important to note that several C. elegans
TFs can be expressed from multiple alternative promoters
(Additional data file 5). Alternative promoters are likely to
drive different patterns and levels of TF production, which
may contribute to the complexity of combinatorial gene
expression.

improvements in gene-prediction software. We have noted
several changes in gene annotations in WormBase releases
subsequent to WS140 that affect wTF2.0 (Additional data file
4). There have been additions, such as Y55F3AM.7 (created in
WS146 and encoding a C2H2 zinc-finger protein), and eliminations, such as Y60A9.2 (encoding a CCCH zinc-finger protein in WS140, but designated a pseudogene since WS141).
We have also noted more subtle adjustments in gene structure based on TWINSCAN [13] suggestions of different
splicing patterns. For example, a modified gene structure for
F22A3.5 that meant the gene product would then include a
complete homeodomain was adopted in WS143, with support
from C. briggsae genome sequence. Similar gene structure
changes that would lead to intact homeodomains for
F34D6.2, R04A9.5 and ceh-31, and an intact bHLH domain
for hlh-19 (see comments in Additional data file 1) may yet be
incorporated into WormBase. Taken together, we expect that
wTF2.0 will be a dynamic resource but that a relatively small
number of TFs will be removed and added over time.

mum number of TF complexes would be half the total number
of TFs predicted if each TF were to exclusively dimerize with
one other TF. Alternatively, the total number of functional
TFs could be much larger than the number of predicted TF
genes if each TF dimerizes with multiple other TFs. To start
addressing this issue, we retrieved a network of TF-TF interactions that were identified in a large-scale yeast two-hybridbased protein-protein interaction mapping study [32] (Figure
4, Additional data file 6). We found 68 putative TF-TF dimers
involving 71 TFs: 35 between members of different TF families and 33 between members of the same TF family. Of these
33, 7 are putative homodimers and the remaining 26 are
putative heterodimers. Interestingly, the TF dimerization
network suggests that certain TFs, such as NHR-49, can function as dimerization hubs. NHR-49 is involved in the regulation of fat storage and life span [33], but it is not known if
NHR-49 functions in these processes as a homodimer or in
concert with other NHR TFs. It is noted that the current TF
dimerization network is only a small representation of all TF
dimers. This is because some TFs may only form dimers on

their cognate DNA and may, therefore, not be detected by
yeast two-hybrid assays; and because the current worm
'interactome' (WI5) only contains approximately 5% of all
protein-protein interactions that can be detected by yeast
two-hybrid assays [32]. Future systematic TF-TF proteinprotein interaction mapping projects are required to determine the total complement of TF dimers. Although it is difficult to interpret interactions between TFs from different
families, they could point to putative combinatorial regulation of target genes. Taken together, assuming that many TFs
can function both as monomers and dimers, the number of
functional TFs will likely exceed the number of predicted
individual TF proteins.

Next, we identified putative human orthologs for each worm
TF, based on reciprocal best BLAST hits [38] (Additional data
file 8). First, we identified members of each TF family in
humans. Subsequently, we determined the number of
ortholog pairs per TF family (Table 1). We found that some TF
families are expanded in humans. For example, the CP2,
C2HC and helix-turn-helix (HTH) TF families are represented by only one or two proteins in the worm each having a
human ortholog. However, the human families are expanded
six-fold. Conversely, other TF families are expanded in the
worm, compared to human. As reported previously [39], the
NHR family is expanded in worms and contains 274
predicted members (versus 43 in humans). Interestingly, the
MADF family, which is composed of nine proteins in the
worm, is not found in humans.

interpret. In addition, one would like to identify paralogous
TFs that share extensive similarity in their DNA binding
domain, because such TFs may bind similar DNA sequences
and, therefore, overlapping sets of target genes. There are
several well characterized examples of redundant C. elegans
TFs, including the Fork Head genes pes-1 and fkh-2 [34], the
GATA factors med-1 and med-2, and end-1 and end-3 [35],
and the T-box genes tbx-8 and tbx-9 [36], and tbx-37 and tbx38 [37]. To identify additional putative redundant or highly
similar TF genes, we used ClustalX analysis to generate trees
that display the level of sequence similarity within each TF
family (Additional data file 7). As expected, the known redundant TFs indicated above are found on adjacent branches in
these trees. Table 2 provides additional TF pairs that share
extensive homology and that, therefore, may be (partially)
redundant.

instance, although for most worm TFs the binding site is completely unknown [40], consensus DNA binding sequences are
available for many human TFs and are collected in the Transfac database [41]. DNA binding domains evolve slower than
other protein sequences [42] and, as a consequence, orthologous TFs recognize similar DNA sequences [43]. Therefore,
DNA binding specificities of human TFs may be helpful to
predict the DNA binding specificities of orthologous C. elegans TFs and vice versa. In the future, orthology of TFs will
be invaluable in the study of the evolution of transcription
regulatory networks.

wTF2.0: a tool for the creation of TF-ORF resources
wTF2.0 provides a starting point for the creation of physical
clone resources that can be used to systematically map transcription regulatory networks. TF-ORFs can be obtained from
the ORFeome resource and efficiently subcloned by a
Gateway cloning reaction into various different Destination
vectors [44,45] (Figure 5). To date, the C. elegans ORFeome

consists of approximately 13,000 full-length ORFs, which is
approximately 66% of all predicted ORFs. We searched worfdb, the ORFeome database [46], and found 652 predicted
TF-encoding ORFs (70%). These TF-ORFs can be used to
map transcription regulatory networks in different ways.
First, they can be cloned into yeast one-hybrid prey vectors to
detect physical interactions with their target genes [26]. For
instance, TF-ORFs have been pooled to create a TF minilibrary that can be used in high-throughput yeast one-hybrid
assays [26]. Second, they can be transferred to yeast twohybrid or 'TAG' vectors for the identification of protein-protein interactions [47,48]. This will be important to further
identify functional TF complexes and to understand how TF
function is regulated. In addition, TAG vectors may be useful
to create transgenic worm strains that can be used in chromatin-immunoprecipitation experiments to identify TF target
genes in vivo. Finally, TF-ORFs can be subcloned into an
RNA interference (RNAi) vector for the analysis of loss-offunction phenotypes or for the identification of genetic inter-

information

WormPep 140 (WS140) (22,420 proteins, 19,735 genes) was
searched. Proteins that have no apparent function in transcription regulation (for example, proteins involved in DNA
repair and replication, chromatin remodeling, kinases) were
removed. In addition, we removed general TFs (Additional
data file 2). To identify TFs missed by the GO search, we
searched WormPep 140 using individual DNA binding
domains (Table 1). Next, we computationally (using SMART,
Pfam or InterPro) or manually inspected each protein
sequence for the presence of a DNA binding domain (Additional data file 2). For C2H2 zinc-fingers, we only considered
proteins that contain fingers with the following configuration: C-X2-5-C-X9-H-X3-5-H [55]. However, we did include
two proteins (LIR-1 and TLP-1) that do not have a canonical
C2H2 zinc-finger, because they were found multiple times in
high-throughput yeast one-hybrid assays (data not shown).
For AT-hook predictions, we used the definition as described

interactions

To date, the Promoterome [11] contains approximately 6,500
promoters (33%), including 279 (30%) TF-promoters. TFpromoters can be fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) in
two configurations. TF-promoters can be fused directly to
GFP in what are referred to as 'transcriptional fusions' and
the resulting promoter::GFP constructs can be used to create
transgenic C. elegans strains in which promoter activity can
be examined by light microscopy [52]. Such lines can also be
used to examine the effects on GFP expression as the result of
a knockdown in regulatory TF levels by RNAi [53].
Alternatively, TF-promoters and corresponding TF-ORFs can
be cloned together with GFP by multisite Gateway cloning
[54] to create 'translational fusions' with GFP. The resulting
promoter::ORF::GFP constructs are used to create transgenic
lines in which both TF-promoter activity and TF subcellular
localization can be examined [11]. Finally, TF-promoters can
be cloned into yeast one-reporter vectors to identify other TFs
that can physically associate with these promoters and that
may contribute to TF promoter activity [26]. Such interactions are important to delineate regulatory cascades, important building blocks in transcription regulatory networks [3].

We have compiled wTF2.0, a comprehensive compendium of
putative C. elegans TFs, using both computational queries
and manual curation. Combining wTF2.0 with different physical TF clone resources provides the first step toward the systematic dissection of C. elegans transcription regulatory
networks.

with candidate redundant genes occurring on adjacent short
branches.

Identification of candidate redundant TFs

TF splice variants and alternative TF promoters

For each TF family with at least five members, an alignment
was created using the multiple alignment mode of ClustalX v.
1.83 [57] under default settings, including the Gonnet series
of protein matrices. For TF genes encoding multiple isoforms,
if the DNA binding domain was identical in all isoforms, the
largest isoform was used. Isoforms containing different DNA
binding domains were included separately. Unrooted trees
were then generated from these alignments using ClustalX v.
1.83 using the Neighbor-Joining method, and visualized
using the phylogram output of TREEVIEW PPC v1.6.6 [58]
(Additional data file 7). Although the analysis was not of sufficient depth for these trees to represent real evolutionary

To identify TF splice variants, the coding sequences of each
TF were retrieved from WS140 using the batch gene tool.
Each splice variant was then manually examined for the
presence of a DNA-binding domain and/or an alternative
promoter.

TF dimers
TF dimers were obtained from worm interactome version 5
(WI5) [32]. TF-TF interactions were modeled into a protein
interaction network using the Cytoscape software package
[59]. In this network, nodes correspond to interactors and

reviews

For each TF, the best human blastp hit was retrieved from
WormBase. The Ensembl ID of each retrieved human protein
was then used to extract the best C. elegans blastp hit and the
corresponding percentage protein sequence identity using
the data-mining tool BioMart. For the 44 TFs that did not
yield a hit individual blast searches were performed. For 26 C.
elegans TFs still no human homolog could be identified.
Reciprocal best blast hits were considered putative orthologs
and are highlighted in bold in Additional data file 8.
