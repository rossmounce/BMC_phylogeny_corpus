Abstract
Background: The β-grasp fold (β-GF), prototyped by ubiquitin (UB), has been recruited for a strikingly diverse
range of biochemical functions. These functions include providing a scaffold for different enzymatic active sites
(e.g. NUDIX phosphohydrolases) and iron-sulfur clusters, RNA-soluble-ligand and co-factor-binding, sulfur
transfer, adaptor functions in signaling, assembly of macromolecular complexes and post-translational protein
modification. To understand the basis for the functional versatility of this small fold we undertook a
comprehensive sequence-structure analysis of the fold and developed a natural classification for its members.
Results: As a result we were able to define the core distinguishing features of the fold and numerous
elaborations, including several previously unrecognized variants. Systematic analysis of all known interactions of
the fold showed that its manifold functional abilities arise primarily from the prominent β-sheet, which provides
an exposed surface for diverse interactions or additionally, by forming open barrel-like structures. We show that
in the β-GF both enzymatic activities and the binding of diverse co-factors (e.g. molybdopterin) have
independently evolved on at least three occasions each, and iron-sulfur-cluster-binding on at least two
independent occasions. Our analysis identified multiple previously unknown large monophyletic assemblages
within the β-GF, including one which unifies versions found in the fasciclin-1 superfamily, the ribosomal protein
L25, the phosphoribosyl AMP cyclohydrolase (HisI) and glutamine synthetase. We also uncovered several new
groups of β-GF domains including a domain found in bacterial flagellar and fimbrial assembly components, and 5
new UB-like domains in the eukaryotes.
Conclusion: Evolutionary reconstruction indicates that the β-GF had differentiated into at least 7 distinct
lineages by the time of the last universal common ancestor of all extant organisms, encompassing much of the
structural diversity observed in extant versions of the fold. The earliest β-GF members were probably involved
in RNA metabolism and subsequently radiated into various functional niches. Most of the structural diversification
occurred in the prokaryotes, whereas the eukaryotic phase was mainly marked by a specific expansion of the
ubiquitin-like β-GF members. The eukaryotic UB superfamily diversified into at least 67 distinct families, of which
at least 19–20 families were already present in the eukaryotic common ancestor, including several protein and
one lipid conjugated forms. Another key aspect of the eukaryotic phase of evolution of the β-GF was the dramatic
increase in domain architectural complexity of proteins related to the expansion of UB-like domains in numerous
adaptor roles.

Background
The discovery of covalent modification of eukaryotic proteins by the conjugation of ubiquitin to the ε-amino
groups of target lysines has spawned some of the most
exciting directions of research in current molecular biology [1-3]. Ubiquitin (Ub) itself is a small polypeptide of
76 residues, and its crystal structure revealed a distinctive
fold dominated by a β-sheet with 5 anti-parallel β-strands
and a single helical segment [4,5] (Figure 1A). Pioneering
investigations of Kraulis, Overington and Murzin showed
that this fold was not unique to Ub, but was also present
in several other proteins with biologically distinct functions. These included the staphylococcal enterotoxin B,
the streptococcal immunoglobulin (Ig)-binding protein G
and 2Fe-2S ferredoxins [6-8]. The common fold shared by
these proteins was termed the β-grasp, because the β-sheet
appears to grasp the helical segment in this domain [7].
These early studies provided the first indications that,
despite its small size, the β-grasp fold (β-GF) might serve
as a multi-functional scaffold in diverse biological contexts.
The centrality of Ub conjugation in eukaryotic molecular
biology has led to numerous investigations on Ub and
Ub-related domains [9,10]. These studies have resulted in
a large body of data on the properties of the Ub-like versions of the β-GF. The key emerging findings were that
several other Ub-like proteins (Ubl), such as Urm1 [11],
Apg12 [12], Nedd8 [13], and SUMO [14,15] are also covalently linked to target polypeptides, just as Ub itself. In
contrast, some Ub-related domains, like the Ubx domain
or Ub-like domains of IκB kinases, play adaptor roles in
Ub-signaling [16-19]. These studies also showed that
eukaryotes possess a distinctive enzymatic apparatus for
Ub-modification, comprised of a cascade of three
enzymes: E1, E2 and E3. These enzymes successively activated Ub/Ubls for transfer using the free energy derived
from ATP hydrolysis, relayed it via thiocarboxylate linkages involving the C-terminal residue of Ub/Ubls, and
finally transferred it to lysines on target polypeptides
[1,10,20-22]. Eukaryotes were also shown to contain an
elaborate apparatus for removal of covalently linked Ub/
Ubls and proteasomal degradation of Ub-modified proteins [23-27].
Concomitantly, structural studies also uncovered several
new versions of the β-GF in a variety of domains, greatly
widening its horizon of biological functions. Examples of
such β-GF domains are: 1) the TGS domain, an RNA-binding domain found in aminoacyl tRNA synthetases and
other translation regulators (PDB: 1QF6 [28,29]). 2) The
doublecortin (DCX) (PDB: 1MJD [30]), RA (PDB: 1C1Y
[31]), PB1 (PDB: 1IPG [32]), and FERM N-terminal
domains (PDB: 1EF1 [33]), which function as adaptors in
animal signaling proteins and apoptosis regulators by

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/18

mediating protein-protein interactions. 3) The soluble ligand-binding β-GF (SLBB) domain involved in binding
vitamin B12 and other solutes in animals and bacteria
(PDB: 2BBC, 2FUGS [34-36]). 4) Various toxins related to
the staphylococcal enterotoxin B including superantigens
involved in the toxic shock syndrome (PDB: 1ESF [37]).
5) Functionally obscure subunits of various enzymatic
complexes, like TmoB of the aromatic monooxygenase
oxygenase complex (PDB: 1T0S [38]) and RnfH of the Rnf
dehydrogenases [39]. 6) Conserved domains, perhaps
involved in RNA binding, in the archaeo-eukaryotic RNA
polymerase RPB2 subunit [40] and bacterial translation
initiation factor IF3 (PDB: 1TIF [41-43]). 7) Staphylokinases and streptokinases which are fibrinolytic enzymes
of low GC Gram-positive bacteria (PDB: 2SAK [44]). 8)
MutT/nudix enzymes – a group of phosphohydrolases
acting on diverse substrates [45]. These observations suggested that the β-GF is indeed a widely utilized structural
scaffold, with an underappreciated versatility and an evolutionary history rich in adaptive radiations.
One notable evolutionary question in this regard was the
origin of eukaryotic Ub and its relationships to other
domains with the β-GF. The first major advances in this
direction came with the identification of the sulfur transfer proteins, ThiS and MoaD, respectively involved in thiamine and Molybdenum cofactor (MoCo) biosynthesis,
which contained β-GFs closely related to Ub [46,47]. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that their C-terminal residues formed thiocarboxylates, just like Ub, and this was
catalyzed by enzymes (ThiF and MoeB), which are very
similar to the E1 enzymes involved in Ub-conjugation
[46-50]. More recently, research from our group showed
that the Ub-conjugation systems might not be an exclusive feature of eukaryotes. Proteins with Ub-like β-GF
domains, and functionally linked enzymes related to E1,
E2 and deubiquitinating peptidases of the JAB domain
superfamily were found in several, phylogenetically
diverse bacteria. We presented evidence that though some
of these systems are likely to be involved in sulfur transfer
reactions in metabolite biosynthesis, akin to ThiS and
MoaD, others might potentially function as bona fide conjugation systems that transfer β-GF proteins to target
polypeptides [39]. Hence, the eukaryotic Ub-conjugation
system might have evolved from more ancient precursors
that were present in bacteria prior to the origin of eukaryotes.
With some clarity emerging on issue of the origin of Ub/
Ubls and the associated biochemical networks, we sought
to investigate the broader issue of the adaptive radiations
of the entire β-GF. In particular we were interested in a
number of problems from structural and evolutionary
stand points: 1) Establishing the entire gamut of structural
and topological variations that have emerged in the β-GF.

2) Identifying any unifying structural themes that might
exist across most or all functionally diverse versions of the
fold. 3) Determination of the lineage-specific sequencestructure correlates for the varied functional adaptations
of the β-GF. 4) Developing a higher order evolutionary
classification for the β-GF and using it as a scaffold to
identify the major temporal phases of adaptive radiation.
5) Identifying instances of drastic shifts in biological or
biochemical functions in specific monophyletic lineages
of the β-GF. One example of such a functional shift is seen
in the evolution of the classical Ub-like proteins, where a
unique post-translational modification system emerged
from a core metabolic sulfur transfer system. 6) Identifying previously unrecognized members of the fold, if any,
and thereby expanding the functional spectrum or providing a rationale for function prediction of uncharacterized
members of the fold. 7) We also hoped that the β-GF
might provide a model for understanding the more general problem of how certain small protein folds tend to be
extensively deployed in a whole diversity of functional
contexts.
In this article we present the results of our systematic analysis of the β-GF with the objective of addressing the above
points.

ascertain the validity of the newly-detected versions (see
Additional file 1 for alignments and complete list of
recovered sequences).
All available structures of bona fide β-GF domains were
compared in order to establish a unique core template
topology that discriminated the β-GF from all other folds
(Figure 1A; Table 1; see below for further details). Then
the representative structures of β-GF domains were used
as queries to search a local current version of the PDB
database for structurally similar domains using the
DALILITE program [54,55]. All hits were evaluated
through reciprocal DALILITE searches of the PDB database to determine if their best matches included any
known β-GF proteins. The hits were also further evaluated
for congruence to the unique topological template. In
addition to the match to the core structural template, we
also systematically documented all unique features of
each newly-detected structure. Through these searches we
were able to identify around ten previously unknown
families/superfamilies of domains containing the β-GF,
including certain structurally distinctive variants. Comparisons of the distributions of previously characterized
globular domains in proteins from sequenced genomes
suggests that our procedures have identified a major fraction of conserved lineages of the β-GF.

Results and Discussion

Identification of β-GF domains
As the β-GF is small in size and its representatives very
divergent, it is not possible to exhaustively identify all
members through sequence or structure similarity
searches initiated from a single starting point. Accordingly, we used a multi-pronged strategy of sequence, structure, and topological similarity searches. As a starting
point, we used all the currently available structures of βGF proteins from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [51]. This
set was compiled by collecting all structures already classified under the β-GF in the SCOP database [6], their relatives from the PDB database that are not present in
SCOP, and new versions which were detected in our
recent studies [34,39]. These representatives were used as
seeds for initiating sequence profile searches of the NCBI
NR (non-redundant) database with the PSI-BLAST program [52] (see materials and methods for details). Statistically significant hits (e < 0.01) recovered in these
searches were used to generate alignments for further
HMM searches of individual genome databases and representatives used for transitive PSI-BLAST searches of the NR
database. All newly-identified clusters of domains distinct
from previously identified sequence families containing
the β-GF were aligned and used to predict secondary structure with the JPRED program [53]. The predicted secondary structure and the conservation pattern were
superimposed onto the secondary structure and conservation patterns of the known β-GF sequence families to

Core conserved topology, structural variation, and
derivatives of the β-GF
A comparison of the available β-GF structures revealed a
common core of 4 strands forming an anti-parallel sheet,
and a single helical region (see Table 1, Fig. 1A). The characteristic topological feature is that the first and last
strands are adjacent and parallel to each other, and the
remaining two strands of the conserved core are anti-parallel and flank the former two strands on either side. The
first and last strands are invariably located in the center of
the sheet with a cross-over occurring via the single helical
element. This helical region is packed against one face of
the sheet, typically leaving the other face exposed. The
chief interacting positions between sheet and the helical
segment and the pattern of key stabilizing hydrophobic
interactions are conserved throughout the fold, supporting its monophyletic origin. The β-GF domains found in
IF3 and the second largest subunit (β-subunit orthologs)
of the archaeo-eukaryotic RNA polymerase more or less
correspond to this conserved core (Figure 1B). Several βGF domains display simple structural elaborations of this
basic 4-stranded core. The simplest of these is the seen in
a small family of yeast proteins typified by Yml108w from
S. cerevisiae (PDB: 1N6Z [56]). This version has a large
insert between the first two strands and an additional helical extension at the C-terminus (Figure 1B). Another
notable variant of the basic 4-stranded form of the β-GF
domain is seen in the catalytic domain of the NUDIX

(MutT) hydrolases. Here, the middle of the second strand
of the conserved core is interrupted by a peculiar insert
that projects out to form a distinctive "outflow". This outflow often assumes a hairpin-like configuration stabilized
by hydrogen bonding between segments in an extended
conformation (Figure 1B).
All other versions of the β-GF are characterized by major
modifications to the 4-stranded core in the form of distinct inserts that add new secondary structure elements.
The first of these is a previously uncharacterized variation
containing an insertion of one or more strands between
the helical segment and strand 3. The conserved inserted
strand seen in all domains with this version forms a hairpin with the connector segment between the helical segment and strand 3 which also assumes an extended
conformation. This hairpin, together with any additional
strands in the insert results in these versions of the fold
assuming barrel-like structures with differing degrees of
openness (Figure 1, Table 1). Examples of this version of
the β-GF domain are observed in the ribosomal protein
L25 (PDB: 1B75 [57]), fasciclin (PDB: 1O70 [58]), and
glutamine synthetase (PDB: 1LGR, 2GLS [59,60]). We
uncovered yet another novel variant of the β-GF in the Nterminal domain of the periplasmic pilus assembly protein FimD (PDB: 1ZE3, chain D [61]). This version is typified by a unique insert N-terminal to the helical segment
which results in the formation of a barrel-like configuration comparable to the above structural variants.
The most common version of the β-GF is typified by the
presence of an additional strand that packs against the
conserved third strand at the margin of the core β-sheet.
The acquisition of this additional strand has resulted in
the emergence of a connector arm that joins it to the terminal conserved strand of the core sheet (Figure 1, Table
1). All ubiquitin-like β-GF domains, including sulfur carrier proteins like MoaD and ThiS, contain this 5-stranded
version of the fold. The connector arm is variable in structure and length and assumes a wide range of conformations ranging from coils to structured elements in
different versions of the fold (Figure 1B, Table 1). A derivative of this Ub-like 5-stranded version is found as a C-terminal domain (UFD) in most eukaryotic E1 Ubconjugating enzymes [62,63] – here a circular permutation appears to have displaced the N-terminus to the Cterminus. Given that the N- and C-terminal strands of the
β-GF are adjacent to each other, the C-terminal strand in
the permuted version occupies the same position as the Nterminal strand of the classical versions, but is oriented in
the opposite direction (Figure 1, Table 1).
The 5-stranded versions may show further variations due
to inserts at different points in the conserved core. One
prominent example is the 2Fe-2S ferredoxin, which con-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/18

tains an insert before the third conserved strand with conserved cysteines for chelating the Fe ion. Similarly, a long
insert adopting an extended conformation is observed at
a comparable position in several versions of the SLBB
domain [34] and the molybdopterin-dependent oxidoreductases (Figure 1B, Table 1). In the SLBB domain, the
curved β-strands from the insert along with the strands of
the β-GF domain core contribute to the formation of a
barrel-like structure (PDB: 2BBC [34]). In the middle
domain of molybdopterin-dependent oxidoreductases
(PDB: 1SOX [64], chain A) there is an additional insert of
2 β-strands associated with the connector arm, which
results in an even more complex 3-layered structure, with
the two inserts forming a barrel-like element within it.
Another previously unknown variant is seen in the N-terminal domain of the aldehyde oxidoreductases (AOR-N)
(PDB: 1AOR [65]), wherein the connector arm assumes
an extended conformation and packs as an additional
strand at the fringe of the β-sheet adjacent to the strand-4
which is a specific feature of the 5-stranded versions (Figure 1B). In the AOR-Ns, two of these variant β-GF
domains stack via the exposed surface of the β-sheet and
form a 4-layered sandwich module.
Our structure similarity searches identified a few structures which, despite lacking the core conserved topology
of the classical β-GF, aligned well with a part thereof.
Reciprocal searches indicated that β-GF domains were the
best hits for these structures. Additionally, these structures
were not representatives of any other previously identified
folds. These structures include the S4 RNA-binding
domain (PDB: 1c05 [66]), the WWE domain (PDB: 2A90
[67]), and the POZ domain (PDB: 1BUO [68]). Previous
structural studies had noted a region of local structural
similarity, termed the α-L motif, between the S4 and the
TGS domain [69]. Given the functional similarity (RNAbinding) and close structural congruence between the
shared elements of these two domains, it is quite likely S4
domain is a degenerate variant of the 5-stranded TGS-like
β-GF domain, which has emerged through partial loss of
the N-terminal part of the domain including the first two
strands. The WWE domain and the POZ domain are
found only in eukaryotes [70], suggesting that they could
have potentially emerged from pre-existing folds through
rapid divergence. Given its general structural similarity
with the β-GF domains, it is likely to have been derived
from the 5-stranded version of this fold. The WWE
domain appears to have acquired an additional strand
after the terminal strand which is inserted in the middle of
the core sheet. The pre-strand 3 region in this domain also
adopts a peculiar structure which makes it appear very different from the classical β-GF domains. In contrast, the
POZ domain appears to have been derived from a 4stranded β-GF domain through different degrees of degra-

dation of the penultimate strand on the fringe of the
sheet.
Natural classification of β-GF domains
In order to address the prime evolutionary questions
about the β-GF, we attempted to construct a classification
that most closely approximates the higher-order evolutionary relationships of the members of this fold. The
small size of the majority of the versions of this domain
often precludes sufficient resolution of relationships
using conventional phylogenetic tree methods, sometimes even within superfamilies that display significant
sequence similarity. This difficulty is further compounded
by the extreme sequence divergence even between versions having highly similar tertiary structures (e.g. ubiquitin and ThiS). Hence, we had to rely to a greater extent on
structure similarity-based clustering, shared derived structural characters, and phyletic patterns of sequence superfamilies to reconstruct the evolutionary history. Thus, we
produced the classification using the following general
steps: 1) sequence similarity-based clustering with the
BLASTCLUST program [71] helped in identifying the
cores of all major sequence families of β-GF domains. 2)
Subsequent comparison of the individual sequence conservation profiles led to the establishment of the most
inclusive higher-order assemblages of these families
(termed superfamilies) based on shared derived features.
3) The next level of relationships beyond what could be
resolved through sequence comparisons was established
using structural similarity. This was done both by constructing distance trees based on pairwise Z-scores for
structure similarity and deriving the most parsimonious
tree based on shared structural features (see Table 1 for
major structural features). This procedure, while allowing
reasonable resolution of the higher-order relationships,
might on occasions produce relatively flat hierarchies for
lower-level clusters where none of the methods offer reliable resolution of relationships. A summary of this classification is presented in Figures 2, 3 and Additional file 2.
Basal versions and other sporadically distributed 4-stranded versions
of the β-GF
The above analysis of the structural diversity of the fold
suggests that the 4-stranded version is the simplest form
from which all other versions could have been derived
through accretion of inserts and additional secondary
structure elements. Two structurally close superfamilies of
the 4-stranded β-GF domain, namely the IF3-N and the
archaeo-eukaryotic RNA polymerase domain, are respectively universally conserved in the bacterial and archaealeukaryotic branches of life. This, taken together with their
shared general functional connection to RNA metabolism, suggests that they arose from a similarly structured
precursor that can be traced back to the last universal common ancestor (LUCA). This structurally simple represent-

ative of the β-GF is likely to represent one of the most
basal lineages of the fold. The remaining sequence clusters
BofC, yeast Yml108w, and immunoglobulin-binding proteins of low GC Gram-positive bacteria with structurally
comparable, simple 4-stranded β-GF domains show
extremely limited phyletic patterns (Additional file 2),
suggesting a probable recent derivation from the more
ancient versions. The versions in the Ig-binding proteins
and BofC are restricted to Gram-positive bacteria, and the
former might have been derived in pathogenic forms from
BofC, which is a secreted developmental signaling molecule widely distributed in free-living Gram-positive bacteria [72,73]. The eukaryote-specific POZ domain might
represent another derivative of a more widely-distributed
4-stranded version, which has accreted an additional Cterminal helical bundle to form a distinctive globular
structure (Figures 1, 2 and Table 1).
The Nudix (MutT) superfamily
The remaining versions of the β-GF fold appear to form a
monophyletic clade unified by the presence of an ancestral "lateral shelf" or "flange" that forms an extended connector between the helical segment and the remaining
portion of the sheet after the topological cross-over (Figure 3 and Table 1). Of these versions, the Nudix superfamily appears to be one of the early branches given that
its β-sheet retains the ancestral 4-stranded core. All members of this superfamily share the above-described insert
or "outflow" in the middle of strand 2 which forms a distinctive shelf for accommodating substrates. This superfamily is also unified by the presence of a conserved PXG
motif in strand-2, immediately after the "outflow", and a
unique constellation of conserved residues in the helical
segment which form the phosphohydrolase active site
[74,75]. The Nudix superfamily represents a rare instance
of adaptation of the β-GF as a scaffold for catalytic activity.
Its phyletic patterns suggest an ancestral presence in all
three superkingdoms implying that it might have been
present in the LUCA (Figure 3, Additional file 2).
Fasciclin-like assemblage
A structurally distinct subgroup of β-GF domains which
was uncovered as a result of our analysis unifies previously unrecognized versions of the fold, namely the fasciclin domain (PDB: 1O70 [58]), the ribosomal protein L25
(PDB: 1B75 [57]), and the phosphoribosyl AMP cyclohydrolase (HisI) (PDB: 1ZPS [76]) with the glutamine synthetase N-terminal domain. The unique insert and
associated structural peculiarities such as the barrel-like
configuration shared by these domains strongly suggests
that they form a higher-order monophyletic cluster within
the β-GF termed the fasciclin-like assemblage. The similar
ligand-interaction patterns seen in most of these lineages
also support the monophyly of this assemblage (see
below for details). Most characterized sequence super-

families within this assemblage appear to bind small molecules or soluble ligands. The fasciclin domain binds
sugar moieties of cell-surface glycoproteins [58], the HisI
domain binds phosphoribosyl AMP [77], and the
glutamine synthetase N-terminal domain contributes to
the substrate binding pocket of the enzyme [59]. The L25
domain binds 5S RNA (PDB: 1DFU [78]), although there
is no evidence that it does so in a comparable manner as
the other members of this assemblage. Given the above
observations, it is possible that the ancestral version of
this assemblage had small-molecule binding capabilities.
Despite the distinctive structural innovations, the conserved core of the β-GF domain in this assemblage is a 4stranded version with a "lateral shelf" suggesting that it
represents an early branch of the clade unified by the latter
derived feature (Figure 3). Of the sequence superfamilies

of this assemblage, the glutamine synthetase N-terminal
domain is traceable to LUCA. Hence, the fasciclin-like version of the β-GF domain might have diverged from other
major lineages of the fold prior to LUCA.
The FimD superfamily, while containing a unique structural variant of the fold, shows greatest structural similarity to the above assemblage. Its phyletic pattern is limited,
being found only in proteobacteria and deinococci (Additional file 2). Thus, it could have been derived from the
above assemblage in a lineage-specific manner.
The 5-stranded assemblage

the fifth strand to the core sheet and the consequent emergence of the "connector arm" linking the additional

strand to the terminal strand (Figure 1A). The strong conservation of this unique structural feature, in conjunction
with the exclusive grouping of these versions in structure
similarity-based clustering, suggests that they form a
monophyletic assemblage. This version of the fold is most
prevalent, both in terms of number of distinct superfamilies contained within it and universal representation
found across all life forms. At least 4 monophyletic lineages of this assembly, namely the TGS domain, the ThiS

and MoaD proteins, and the 2Fe-2S ferredoxins can be
traced to LUCA. Beyond these, there are several lineages
that are conserved in a single superkingdom or distributed
more sporadically within a superkingdom. On the whole,
two major clades can be recognized within the 5-stranded
assemblage. The first of these, termed the classical 5stranded clade, unites the three ancient lineages TGS, ThiS,
and MoaD and several other closely-related versions. This
clade is also supported by the presence of a highly con-

served alcoholic residue at the transition between the Nterminal hairpins and the helical segment of the fold [39].
The UB-like β-GF domains are derived from the ThiS and
MoaD-like versions and comprise the most diverse superfamily within the classical 5-stranded clade.
Eukaryotic representatives of the UB-like superfamily β-GF domains
In eukaryotes, this superfamily has undergone explosive
diversification with at least 19–20 distinct families which
can be traced back to the last eukaryotic common ancestor
(LECA). These families include six conjugated versions
(ubiquitin, Urm1, Apg8/Aut7, Apg12, Ufm1 and SUMO/
SMT3) [79,80] and several known or predicted to function as adapters in multi-domain proteins, like the tubulin cofactor B (TBCB) [81], Ub/Ubl conjugating E1
enzymes [62,63] and phosphatidyl-inositol 3 kinase
(PI3K) [82]. Overall, in the course of eukaryotic evolution, at least 67 distinct sequence families appear to have
emerged within this superfamily with some restricted to
particular eukaryotic kingdoms like animals or plants. We
identified several previously uncharacterized eukaryotic
families such as NPL4p, the UB-like domains of the BMI1/
Posterior Sex Combs family of chromatin associated E3
ligases, a family with the UB-like domain fused to a cytochrome b5 domain, and the auxin response factor
(BIPOSTO) in plants (see Additional file 1 for alignments). On the whole, comparisons of sequence conservation profiles showed that β-GF domains related to the
classical ubiquitin domain form a large monophyletic
assemblage within the superfamily, including several distinct families such as Nedd8, SUMO, ubiquitin, NPL4,
BAG, the Ubx domain, the tubulin co-factors or chaperones (TBCB and TBCE), Bat3/Dsk and Apg12/Gate16 (Fig.
3). The circularly permuted C-terminal UFD of eukaryotic
E1s, which distinguishes them from the prokaryotic E1related enzymes, also appears to have been derived from
this lineage. Sequence comparisons also showed that the
RA, FERM N-terminal module, and PI3K adapter domain
families form another distinct higher-order monophyletic
lineage. The remaining lineages typified by ECR1/UBA1
and BM-002, while structurally close to the rest, formed
distinct sequence families that could not be placed into
the any of the above larger assemblages of families (see
Additional file 2 for details).
Bacterial representatives of the UB-like superfamily and the classical
5-stranded assemblage
In bacteria, Ub-like superfamily includes several sporadically distributed UB-like families which have been previously described in considerable detail [39]. Several other
sporadic bacterial lineages also belong to the classical 5stranded clade, such as the fibrinolytic adapters of several
Gram-positive bacteria (e.g. streptokinase), the superantigen/toxin domains, the RnfH proteins and subunits of
aromatic compound monooxygenases like TmoB. Our

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/18

searches also identified a previously unknown version of
the classical 5-stranded clade in a group of bacterial flagellar assembly proteins typified by FliD, FlgL and FlgK,
and related bacteriophage-tail proteins found in a range of
Mu-like caudoviruses (see Additional file 1). Sequence
searches indicate that RnfH is closest to the TGS domains
and is likely to be an offshoot of that superfamily (Fig. 3).
The superantigen/toxin versions and the streptokinase/
staphylokinases appear to form a monophyletic cluster, as
they are both secreted versions and interact with substrates similarly (See below). However, barring RnfH, the
exact relationships of these more sporadic bacterial lineages to the more ancient lineages of the classical 5stranded clade remain unclear.
The soluble ligand or metal-binding clade of the 5-stranded
assemblage
The second major clade of the 5-stranded assemblage unifies a group of β-GF domains whose interrelationships
were previously unknown. This clade is unified by the
presence of a set of inserts that are associated with binding
soluble ligands or chelating metal ions. While the inserts
themselves are poorly conserved in sequence, their position, especially in relation to the bound ion or ligand, is
well conserved. The main sequence superfamilies in this
clade are the 2Fe-2S ferredoxins, the SLBB domains, and
the molybdopterin-dependent oxidoreductase domains.
As recently shown, the SLBB superfamily is of bacterial
provenance [34]. The molybdopterin-dependent oxidoreductases, typified by the sulfite oxidase (SOX), are widely
distributed in all the three superkingdoms but show no
evidence in phylogenetic analysis for being present in
LUCA. Given that the eukaryotic versions localize to the
mitochondrion [83], they appear to have probably been
derived from the bacterial progenitor of the mitochondria. The N-terminal domain of the L-proline dehydrogenase-type oxidoreductase (PDB: 1Y56 [84]) is another
family of proteins belonging to this clade of the 5stranded assemblage. Sequence profile analysis showed a
statistically significant relationship between these
domains and the 2Fe-2S ferredoxins, suggesting that they
belong to the same superfamily. They appear to have been
derived from the more universally distributed 2Fe-2S
ferredoxins through loss of the metal-chelating conserved
cysteines relatively early in bacterial evolution.
The N-terminal module of the aldehyde oxidoreductases
A distinctive superfamily of the 5-stranded assemblage
that we discovered in our analysis was the N-terminal
module of the aldehyde oxidoreductase (AOR-N) (PDB:
1AOR [65]) that contains two tandem, distantly related
copies of the β-fold. These are unified by the modified
structure of their connector arm, ligand-binding and
dimerization pattern. This structural modification makes
it difficult to identify their affinities to other members of

Biology Direct 2007, 2:18

the 5-stranded assemblage. It should be noted that they
lack any unique structure or sequence feature unifying
them to the sulfite oxidase-like molybdopterin-binding βGF domains. Hence, it is possible that they arose from a
MoaD-like precursor that evolved an ability to bind metallopterins specifically (See below). Phyletic patterns indicate a potential bacterial origin for this superfamily. The
above-mentioned structural similarity of the universally
distributed S4 RNA-binding domain with the TGS
domain suggests that the former might be another highly
divergent lineage that was derived from a TGS-like classical 5-stranded β-GF domain prior to LUCA.
The relative timeline of major adaptive radiations and
functional transitions of the β-GF domains
The pre-LUCA phase and inference of the ancestral function of the
β-GF
The inference of at least 7 β-GF or β-GF-derived (the S4
domain) lineages in LUCA suggests that there was a major
diversification of the fold even before LUCA (Figure 3). In
structural terms, the inferred representatives in LUCA
span all major variants of the fold, from the simplest 4stranded versions to the barrel-like forms (GS-N domain)
to simple and elaborated versions the 5-stranded form.
This suggests that the major structural variations were
already in place as a result of the early diversification
events of the pre-LUCA phase. In functional terms, versions close to the primitive state of both the 4- and 5stranded forms, the RNA polymerase/IF3-N domain and
the TGS domain, respectively, as well as the possible β-GF
derivative, the S4 domain, have functions related to RNA
metabolism or RNA-binding [29,43,85]. Even members
of the Nudix clade are known to interact with nucleic
acids or chemically-related molecules such as nucleoside
diphosphate derivatives [74]. RNA metabolism-associated functions are also sporadically observed in laterderived lineages such as the L25 ribosomal proteins in the
fasciclin-like assemblage, the family of prokaryotic UBrelated domains fused to the Mut-7C-like RNAses [39],
and several eukaryotic UB-like domains like those found
in eIF3 p135/Clu-1 (see Additional file 1 for an alignment), RBBP6 (DWNN domain) [86], and prp21/Splicing
factor 3 [87]. Given that the at least 4 of the seven main
lineages traceable to LUCA, including some of the inferred
basal lineages, have a RNA/ribonucleoprotein associated
role, it appears likely that the ancestral version of the β-GF
was probably involved in RNA-binding. The distribution
of RNA-related roles (Fig. 3, Fig, 4) implies that this function seems to have been retained or re-acquired in some
sense in several later derived versions of the fold.

A corollary to the inference of the ancestral function of the
fold is that there were major functional innovations even
in the pre-LUCA period. These are most prominently seen
in the 5-stranded assemblage, and appear to be associated

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/18

with the emergence of distinctive roles in sulfur delivery
and scaffolding of Fe-S clusters. Previous observations
have shown biochemical links between the formation of
metal-sulfur clusters and sulfur transfer, including pathways in which ThiS and MoaD-like proteins participate
[88]. This observation raises the intriguing possibility that
the earliest functional shift involved recruitment of a 5stranded β-GF domain for a shared general role in both
sulfur transfer and generation of Fe-S clusters. It is quite
possible that the subsequent specialization of such a
generic precursor spawned the two paralogous families of
sulfur transfer proteins (MoaD and ThiS) on one hand
and the 2Fe-2S ferredoxins on the other. The rise of the
2Fe-2S ferredoxins probably coincided with the emergence of the precursors of the electron transfer chains of
respiratory metabolism. The early divergence of MoaD
and ThiS suggests that some basic aspects of the biosynthetic pathways for complex sulfur-containing metabolites like molybdenum/tungsten cofactor and thiamine
evolved prior to LUCA.
The post-LUCA phase: the prokaryotic superkingdoms
The emergence of the two prokaryotic superkingdoms, the
archaea and bacteria, was marked by numerous
superkingdom-specific innovations. Several of these innovations appear to have happened early in the history of
the bacteria followed by multiple lateral transfers to the
archaea. Likewise, innovations occurring in bacteria were
also transferred to eukaryotes both during the primary
endosymbiotic event and sporadically through later transfers. Members performing some form of most of the biochemical functions observed in extant representatives of
the fold emerged in course of the post-LUCA diversification in bacteria. In certain cases there were no major shifts
in basic biochemical activity but only an expansion of the
range of specific biological contexts in which these activities were deployed. These included new RNA-binding/
ribonucleoprotein-related contexts emerging within
diverse branches of the clade (e.g. L25 in the fasciclin-like
assemblage and the prokaryotic UB-like family fused to
Mut-7C RNAse) or adaptation of ThiS/MoaD-type proteins in sulfur transfer systems related to synthesis of lineage-specific metabolites [89]. The principal, early
functional innovations in the prokaryotic radiations were
the independent acquisition of multiple small molecule/
solute-binding capabilities across distant members of the
fold, as seen in the SLBB, fasciclin, and AOR-N domains.
Another notable feature of this evolutionary phase was
the emergence of at least three catalytic versions amongst
phylogenetically distant assemblages of the fold. The
phosphoribosyl AMP cyclohydrolase of the fascilin-like
assemblage and molybdopterin-dependent oxidoreductase domain related to the 2Fe-2S ferredoxins and SLBB
domains are sister groups of the small-molecule binding
versions. This suggests that the transition to catalysis

probably occurred from an ancestral soluble ligand-binding state. However, emergence of catalysis in the Nudix
superfamily appears to be a likely extension of the original
nucleic acid-binding properties of the fold.
This phase also saw the recruitment of several forms of the
β-GF domain for mediating specific protein-protein interactions in the assembly or stabilization of multi-protein
complexes. Different distantly related β-GF domains were
recruited in the biogenetic systems of flagella and analogous structures, the pili. The FimD protein has an N-terminal β-GF domain fused to a C-terminal outer membranespanning domain [90]. This β-GF domain serves as an
adapter to recruit the fimbrial subunit chaperone FimC
while the C-terminal domain serves as a platform on
which the fimbrial subunits assemble to form the pilus

[91,92]. Likewise, novel versions of the classical 5stranded β-GF domain, which we discovered in FliD and
FlgL/FlgK, are likely to play roles in the assembly of flagellum (FliD) and its hook (FlgL/K), while their relatives in
Mu-like bacteriophages might similarly help in assembly
of the viral tail (see Additional file 1). Pathogenic bacteria
appear to have sporadically adapted both 4- and 5stranded versions in roles related to interaction with host
proteins as a part of their virulence. The strepto/staphylokinases which interact with plasmin, and the superantigens which interact with vertebrate T-cell receptors [93]
from the 5-stranded assemblage and the immunoglobulin-binding domains [94] of the 4-stranded assemblage
appear to represent multiple convergent recruitments for
virulence-related interactions. The classical 5-stranded
clade in particular appears to have given rise to several lin-

Page 12 of 28

Biology Direct 2007, 2:18

eages that seem to function as protein interaction adapters, assembly or stability factors in very different
biochemical contexts. For example, the TmoB family
might function in stabilizing the proteobacterial aromatic
monooxygenase complex [38], different members of the
RnfH family might play roles in protein stability or assembly of the Rnf oxidoreductase complex, and YukD in the
assembly of the ESAT-type export systems of Firmicutes
[39].
However, the most important innovation in the bacteria
was the emergence of potential conjugation systems that
covalently linked ubiquitin-like β-GF domains to other
proteins (predecessors of the eukaryotic conjugation systems). In functional terms, this process represents a collusion of the sulfur-transfer aspect with the protein
interaction function which was also widely emerging in
members of the fold. The preliminary analysis of these
bacterial UB-like systems suggests that they might have
already acquired roles related to protein stability and signaling. The details of the bacterial antecedents of the
eukaryotic UB-conjugation system have already been discussed in a recent work [39] and are not dwelt upon here.
The eukaryotic phase: expansion of the ubiquitin-like domains
Genomic and cell biological evidence suggests that the
eukaryotes emerged as a result of a basic endosymbiotic
event between a proteobacterium and an archaeon (most
likely a euryarchaeon) [95-97]. Consequently, eukaryotes
inherited several versions of the β-GF domain found in
both their archaeal and bacterial (mitochondrial) precursors (see Figure 2 and Additional file 2). The currently
available data implies that in eukaryotes there was no
diversification of the β-GF domain comparable to what
happened in bacterial evolution that resulted in emergence of fundamentally new biochemical activities.
Eukaryotes, however, showed an explosive development
of the ubiquitin-like lineage resulting in forms that occupied biological functional niches across the entire cell.
Most of these functions depend on the ancient property of
the classical ubiquitin-like 5-stranded version to mediate
protein-protein interactions, particularly in relation to the
assembly or stabilization of complexes. These functions
were performed either via conjugation of UB/UBLs to target proteins and phosphatidylethanolamine, or as
domains within multi-domain proteins. The biochemical
diversification of the UB-like clade to perform multiple
biological roles appears to have been notable even in
LECA (Figure 4). These adaptations include: 1) conjugation to proteins destined for degradation (classical UB). 2)
Tagging of proteins for altering interactions and localization (e.g. SUMO/SMT3) [14,15] 3) conjugation to both a
protein target (Apg5p) and the amino group of the lipid
phosphatidylethanolamine (Agp8p/Aut7p) in regulation
of the distinctly eukaryotic process of autophagy. 4) Pos-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/18

sible recognition of proteins with conjugated UB moieties
(e.g. NPL4) [98]. 5) Binding of E2s to present them to the
active site of E1s for conjugation of UB/UBls (the UFD of
E1s [62,63]). 6) Assembly of tubulin polymers (TBCB)
[81] and microtubule-binding (DCX domains [30]). 7)
Protein-protein interactions in Ub-modification (e.g. Ublike domains in Ub-deconjugating enzymes like Ubp7/
Ubp14 and the Bmi1/Posterior Sex Combs-like E3s) and
other signaling pathways (e.g. PI3 Kinase N-terminal
domain) [82]. The ancestral eukaryotic member of the
UB-like clade is likely to have been a conjugated version
because: 1) conjugated forms are seen across the entire
diversity of the eukaryotic UB-like clade, which includes at
least 5 versions traceable to LECA and 2) they preserve the
basic thiocarboxylate-forming chemistry seen in their
even more ancient precursors like ThiS or MoaD. Given
the inferred presence of multiple non-conjugated forms in
LECA, multiple early functional shifts resulting in nonconjugated appear to have occurred prior to the divergence of extant eukaryotes from LECA, but after the emergence of the first eukaryotic cell.
Subsequently in eukaryotic evolution, there appear to
have been several innovations of non-conjugated versions. Many of these continued to function in contexts
related to UB signaling, presumably by recognizing conjugated UB moieties (Figure 4, Additional file 2). However,
a few seem to have acquired entirely unrelated functions;
for example, the RA domain in RAS signaling [31] and the
CAD domain in apoptotic signaling [99-102]. In temporal
terms, a major pre-LECA expansion resulted in at least 19–
20 distinct families in the ancestor of extant eukaryotes,
followed by new families like the PB1 domain sporadically appearing throughout subsequent eukaryotic evolution. A notable phase of new innovation through
sequence diversification resulted in several new families
(e.g. Nedd8) prior to the radiation of the eukaryotic
crown group comprised of plants, slime molds, fungi, and
animals. Interestingly, in the animal lineage alone, there
appears to have been another massive round of diversification resulting in more than 10 distinct sequence families. The plants show a lineage expansion of a group of
UB-like domains in the BIPOSTO/ARF transcriptional regulators (see Additional file 1) which emerged from the
more ancient PB1 family. Thus, in general, there appears
to be a correlation between the emergence of new UB-like
families and that of multi-domain proteins in the signaling systems of crown group eukaryotes, especially animals
[103]. Parallel to this expansion of UB-like domains in
eukaryotes, there was also an expansion of other components of the UB-conjugation system such as E1, E2, and E3
enzymes, F-box and UBA domains, and deubiquitinating
peptidases [20,23,26]. In the eukaryotes there also
appears to have been a derivation of at least two domains,

namely the POZ and WWE domain through major structural modification of the core β-GF domains.
Evolutionary trends in the domain architectures of β-GF domains
Previous studies on domains occurring in diverse architectural contexts in multi-domain proteins have hinted at a
strong relationship between domain architectures and
functional constraints [104]. We systematically analyzed
the domain architectures of the β-GF domains and their
conservation across evolution to identify these constraints
and any role they might have in predicting functions of
uncharacterized versions of the domain. Both the sulfurcarrier function and conjugation to other proteins require
the free carboxy-terminus of the standalone β-GF domain.
As a result, the standalone copies of the 5-stranded UBlike version have been preserved across all three
superkingdoms since LUCA. But an alternative strategy to
this, observed primarily in eukaryotes, is the generation of
free C-termini through post-translational proteolytic
cleavage as seen in the polyubiquitins and APG8p
(Aut7p). This raises that possibility that there might be
other as yet undiscovered versions which are released for
conjugation by proteolytic processing, as has been previously proposed for the DWNN domain [86]. In this context, it remains to be seen if the Ub-like domain in the
eukaryotic DDI1p-like proteins [39], which is connected
via a glycine-rich linker to the rest of the protein (Fig. 5)
might be processed by the C-terminal aspartyl peptidase
domain release a free UB-like polypeptide.

In contrast, versions involved in protein and nucleic acid
interactions are under no major constraints to remain as
standalone forms of the domain. Hence, we find numerous instances of β-GF domains involved in this function
occurring in multi-domain architectures. The ribosomal
proteins tend to be small and usually one or two-domain
proteins. Accordingly, there is not much architectural
diversity seen in case of forms like L25. The forms found
in the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase represent some
of the most complex architectures wherein the β-grasp
domain is inserted within an RRM-fold domain which in
turn is inserted within a larger, multi-domain scaffold
[43]. In most cases, the multi-domain architectures of
RNA metabolism-related proteins are well-conserved
across entire superkingdoms or even the three superkingdoms of Life because of the universality of these functions
in their respective phyletic ranges. Multi-domain architectures associated with signaling or small-molecule interactions are often more restricted in their phyletic range and
show lineage-specific diversity [105,106]. Consistent with
this, considerable lineage-specific diversity is observed in
prokaryotic β-GF domains involved in small moleculebinding like the cobalamin-binding SLBB domains and
fasciclin domains and certain enzymes such as the molybdopterin-dependent oxidoreductases (Figure 5). All these

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/18

domains are typically encountered in secreted proteins
and form highly variable multi-domain architectures in
various bacteria. In some instances two distinct versions
of the β-GF domain might occur in the same polypeptide:
for example, the fasciclin domain and the molybdopterindependent oxidoreductase domains occur in certain
secreted enzymes (Figure 5). Conversely, the small molecule-binding β-GF in certain highly conserved intracellular enzymes like glutamine synthetase and aldehyde
oxidoreductases do not show much diversity in domain
architectures.
To objectively assess the trends in domain architectural
complexity, we made use of the previously devised complexity quotient (CQ) [19]. The CQ provides a measure of
the complexity of domain architectures in which a given
domain occurs (Figure 5). Specifically, it is defined as the
product of the number of different types of domains that
co-occur with β-grasp domain containing proteins and the
average number of domains detected in these proteins.
The complexity quotient was plotted against the total
number of proteins containing β-GF domains in a given
organism. This was done for 19 completely sequenced
species of prokaryotes and 19 eukaryotic proteomes spanning the entire currently available phyletic spectrum of
organisms with sequenced genomes. In the case of
prokaryotes the plot reveals a more or less flat line with an
approximately constant domain architectural complexity
across all prokaryotes, irrespective of the number of β-GF
proteins they possessed (Figure 5). The plot only showed
a few anomalous points: there was a greater than expected
paucity of β-GF proteins in the highly reduced genome of
Mycoplasma and an inexplicably high architectural complexity in Thermotoga maritima. Thus, barring very few
exceptions, the main tendency in prokaryotes is a wide
variability in the number of proteins with β-GF domains
rather than any concerted increase in architectural complexity.
Eukaryotes not only have greater numbers of β-GF
domain proteins, but also appear to display greater diversity of domain architectures relative to the prokaryotes.
The complexity of the β-GF proteins as well as their numbers appear to increase throughout eukaryotic evolution
with the highest figures observed in multicellular organisms of the eukaryotic crown group. However, the increase
in architectural complexity is not linear across eukaryotes,
with a tendency to plateau in animals. The only exception
to the strong trend is Trichomonas vaginalis, a basal eukaryote, which appears to have undergone a massive, relatively recent proliferation across most protein families
[107]. As a result it possesses an unexpectedly large
number of β-GF proteins, but low architectural complexity comparable to other basal eukaryotes with similar
numbers of β-GF-containing proteins (Figure 5). In terms

of actual architectures, the multicellular eukaryotes show
numerous lineage-specific multi-domain proteins with
different β-GF domains, which are often involved in specific signaling pathways that correspond to unique aspects
of the biology of these organisms. For example, the programmed cell death pathways in animals and the auxinresponse in plants contain representatives with such
unique architectures (Figure 5) [19].
Typically, many of the eukaryotic multi-domain architectures, both ancient and lineage-specific, tend to combine
the UBL domains with other signaling domains, typically
those involved in UB-signaling. These combinations
include those with deubiquitinating peptidases (e.g. of
the OTU superfamily), E3 ligases usually of the RING
superfamily (Figure 5), and other UB-binding domains
like UBA, or other kinds of signaling domains like kinases
as seen in the IKKs and Doublecortin. Another feature
seen in eukaryotic architectures is the architectural variability through domain loss or accretion, even in the case
of highly conserved orthologous proteins. For example,
the Npl4p family [108] of Ubls is conserved throughout
eukaryotes and might play a role as a novel E3 in degradation of proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. It can be
reconstructed as having an ancestral architecture that
combined an N-terminal Ubl with a central region containing variable numbers of a novel Zn-chelating cysteine
cluster domain and a C-terminal catalytically inactive version of the JAB peptidase domain (Figure 5, see Additional file 1). In the plant lineage the central Zn-chelating
cluster is lost, while in animals and fungi an additional
Zn-finger domain is inserted N-terminal to the cysteinerich Zn-cluster.
Structural correlates for functional diversity in the β-GF
We next sought to decipher the relationship between
functional diversification and structural elaborations of
the fold. For this purpose, we created an idealized representation of the β-GF fold (Figure 6) and divided the
structural elements into equivalent zones that are comparable across the available structures. We then mapped
interactions to ligands (see materials and methods for
details) in all members for which this data is available
onto the above scaffold to obtain an interaction map for
the fold (Figure 6). We then used this interaction map in
conjunction with the above developed classification
scheme and relative temporal pattern of diversification to
explore the evolution of the structure-function relationships. For the sake of convention, we refer to the exposed
surface of the core β-sheet as the "exposed face" and the
opposite surface of the sheet which might be obscured by
the packing helical segment, the lateral shelf or flange,
and the connector arm (in the 5-stranded versions) as the
"obscured face". We refer to the C-terminal most portion
of the final strand as the "tail".

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/18

Little is known of the exact mode of interactions of the
basal 4-stranded versions of the fold. However, the apparent rarity of the simple 4-stranded versions suggests that
there appears to be a tendency to elaborate the core sheet
to provide an increased interface for interactions. On the
whole, the exposed face mediates more interactions across
the β-GF fold compared to the obscured face. Thus, the
proliferation and widespread utilization of the 5-stranded
version might be associated with the availability of a
larger surface on the exposed face for mediating contacts.
Another evolutionary trend is the formation of a barrellike configuration through insertion of strands which on
instances provides a classical interaction interface at the
open end of the barrel. We discuss below more specific
themes of interaction that were observed in multiple
superfamilies of the fold.
Solute interaction in the fasciclin-like assemblage
As discussed above, the prevalence of soluble ligands such
as sugars, amino acids, and metabolic intermediates for
different sequence superfamilies of the clade suggested an
ancestral solute-binding role for these proteins. Analysis
of the interactions with respect to the shared structural
core of this assemblage suggests that the insert and the lateral shelf form an interface for soluble ligand interaction
in fasciclin, GS-N, and phosphoribosyl-AMP cyclohydrolase domains [59,77,109]. Furthermore, in glutamine synthetase this interaction might indirectly contribute to
catalysis via a conserved aspartate from this region that
interacts with the substrate bound at the active site and
helps in anchoring it there. This suggests that ancestral
versions of this assemblage probably mediated a generic
ligand interaction via a similar interface. The interactions
of the L25 domain via this interface, if any, remain
unknown. However, it is known to contact 5S rRNA via
the exposed face [78]. FimD, which appears to be a distant
relative of the fasciclin-like assemblage, assumes a classical barrel configuration, with the "open-end" of the barrel
providing an interface for interacting with the FimC
immunoglobulin domain [61]. Similar "open-ends" of
topologically unrelated barrels like the OB fold, PRC, and
SH3 barrels are known to mediate interactions with ligands in a like manner [110-112]. The loop between the
penultimate two strands of the core FimD β-GF domain is
one of the major determinants of the interaction and this
feature is comparable to certain interactions of the phosphoribosyl-AMP cyclohydrolase domain (see below).
Metal chelation, solute interaction, and prosthetic group attachment
in the SLBB/ferredoxin/molybdopterin-dependent oxidoreductase
clade
The unifying inserts of this clade typically occur in the
region prior to strand 3 and in the region associated with
the connector arm or the additional strand of the 5stranded core. However, there is considerable diversity in

Page 16 of 28
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2007, 2:18

the means by which these inserts mediate specific interactions, both between and within different superfamilies of
this clade. The 2Fe-2S ferredoxins contain a characteristic
set of four cysteines, three of which come from the prestrand 3 insert and one from the connector arm-associated
insert which help in coordination of the 2Fe-2S cluster
[113]. The proline dehydrogenase N-terminal domain lineage of this superfamily lacks the cysteines but retains the
inserts, suggesting that it might have been reused for interactions with as yet uncharacterized small molecule ligands. As previously shown, members of the SLBB
superfamily typified by transcobalamin and related B12binding proteins contain a conserved aromatic residue in
the pre-strand 3 insert which plays a central role in binding the ligand [34]. In the molybdopterin-dependent oxidoreductase superfamily, the barrel formed by the prestrand-3 and the connector arm regions provides an open
face for accommodating the molybdopterin ligand. Additionally, a conserved cysteine present in the pre-strand-3
insert is covalently linked to molybdopterin [64]. The
above-described evolutionary history of this clade suggests that the ferredoxins were probably the most ancient
versions. The subsequent diversification of this clade
appears to have involved extensive adaptation of the
binding site that originally contained the 2Fe-2S cluster
for accommodating a diverse set of new ligands. Additionally, the exposed face in most of these cases remains available for interaction with other domains or polypeptides to
recruit the β-GF domain to larger complexes. This has
been extensively demonstrated in the case of the 2Fe-2S
ferredoxins [114,115].
Interactions of AOR-N β-GF domains with metallopterins
The AOR-N domain represents the second independent
case of a β-GF domain acquiring the capability to bind
tungstoperin or molybdopterin and iron-sulfur clusters
(4Fe-4S). Here, a head-to-tail dimer formed by the two
tandemly repeated β-GF domains bind metallopterin via
the unusually structured connector arms that form a
strand at the fringe of the core 5-stranded sheet [65] (Figure 6). While the two tandem repeats are very similar in
structure, they are highly divergent in sequence, and contribute different sets of residues in the connector arm to
contact the metallopterin. The N-terminal domain contributes an asparagine that directly interacts with the
pterin moiety, whereas the C-terminal domain contributes a conserved arginine that interacts with the sulfoxide
moiety that chelates the Tungsten or Molybdenum. The
same arginine from the C-terminal domain also interacts
with the 4Fe-4S metal cluster. Additionally, a threonine
from the loop between strand-3 and stand-4 of the core βgrasp domain also interacts with the 4Fe-4S cluster [65]
(Figure 6). Thus, the 4-layered sandwich formed by the
two derived β-GF domains help in positioning the metallopterin and 4Fe-4S for the C-terminal α-helical domain

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/18

to catalyze the redox reactions on the substrates. It is possible that this neomorphic mode of substrate interaction
arose from MoaD-like precursors that evolved the ability
to recognize metallopterins as dimers, as an offshoot of
their ancestral function in metallopterin biosynthesis.
Principal protein and nucleic acid interactions observed in the 5stranded assemblage
A diverse range of protein-protein interactions are shown
by both prokaryotic and eukaryotic members of the 5stranded assemblage, including those with the E1, E2 and
E3 enzymes or their prokaryotic counterparts. The
recently published structure of the complex of Nedd8
with its E1 and E2 enzymes [62], in conjunction with the
data accumulated from several other structures and mutagenesis experiments helps in deciphering the key modes
of interaction prevalent in the 5-stranded clade. Nedd8
interacts via the exposed face with the sheet of the Rossmann fold domain of the adenylating domain of the E1,
as in the case of the ThiS/MoaD clade [48,49]. Similarly
the exposed face is also used by the β-GF of the C-terminal
UFD of the E1 to recruit the E2. More generally, different
parts of the exposed face of the sheet mediate interactions
specific to particular representatives of the 5-stranded
assemblage (Figure 6). In particular, zones corresponding
to the C-termini of the first and last strands which lie in
the center of the sheet are utilized for protein interactions
by all studied members of the classical 5-stranded clade.
The structures of the eukaryotic members of the classical
5-stranded clade show that many of the interaction positions on the exposed face are shared, though the actual
residues at those positions might not be conserved.
Hence, the interaction specificity of different members
has mainly arisen via sequence diversity at spatially congruent interaction sites, as opposed to acquisition of
entirely new modes of interaction. The availability of the
exposed face that provides an extended surface for interaction appears to be the primary factor for the pervasive use
of this fold as mediator of protein-protein interactions
across biologically disparate contexts. In a few instances,
the obscured face of the RA (PDB: 1LFD [116]) and
elongin domains (PDB: 1VCB [117]) might mediate specific interactions suggesting that their adapter function
might depend on using both faces to mediate different
sets of specific interactions.

In the complex of Nedd8 with its conjugating enzymes,
the Nedd8 moiety covalently linked to the cysteine in the
thioester-forming α-helical domain of the E1 protein also
serves to recruit its specific E2 [62]. This occurs via a
unique interaction involving the cleft formed between
then sheet and the helix of the β-GF, which constitutes the
"open-end" of the barrel-like form of the fold in Nedd8.
This is reminiscent of the interaction observed in the
FimD-like versions of the β-GF. From the side of the E2,

Biology Direct 2007, 2:18

the interaction is mediated via the conserved C-terminal
helix. The high diversity of the residues in the E2 helix as
well as the cleft of the Ub/Ubls suggests that this interaction is required for the specificity of E2-Ubl association.
This interaction is representative of the more generic tendency of peripheral locations on the fold to be deployed
in specific interactions that might be required only for the
unique function performed by a particular superfamily
(Figure 6). In the sulfur carrier and conjugated versions,
the C-terminal tail plays a specific role in interaction with
the active site of enzymes performing the adenylation or
thioesterification [47-49,62]. The role of the exposed face
in protein-protein interactions appears to be a conservative aspect of the entire 5-stranded assemblage, which has
been preserved from a period predating LUCA. Similarly,
the mode of interaction with modifying enzymes via the
tail appears to be an ancient conserved one. The apparently complex multiple protein-protein interactions in the
eukaryotic Ub-conjugation process also appear to have
emerged from the repeated use of the exposed face for
interaction with E1, E2 and E3 partners.
In contrast to protein-protein interaction, little is known
of the actual mode of RNA-interaction by versions of the
classical 5-stranded assemblage like the TGS domain.
While it is possible that the exposed face provides an interface as observed in the L25-5S rRNA-interactions [78], the
conserved "α-L" structural motif shared by the S4 and TGS
domains [69] suggests a role for the obscured face in RNA
interactions.
Multiple "inventions" of enzymes in the β-GF
At least 3 distinct superfamilies of enzymes use the β-GF
the primary scaffold for their active sites. None of the
enzymatic forms can be confidently traced to LUCA.
Instead they appear to have emerged early in bacterial evolution. Furthermore, the enzymatic versions are only distantly related to each other suggesting that the β-GF fold
has been convergently used to provide catalytic scaffolds.
In the case of phosphoribosyl-AMP cyclohydrolase and
the molybdopterin-dependent oxidoreductases like
sulfite oxidase, the main pre-adaptation for catalysis
stems from the ancestral ligand binding capabilities that
emerged in the assemblages to which they belong. In the
case of the Nudix superfamily, the pre-adaptation was
possibly the nucleic acid-binding ability of the ancient 4stranded versions of β-GF. Consistent with the convergent
origins of catalysis in each instance emergence of enzymatic activity appears to have resulted in some distinctive
structural changes that go beyond the above pre-adaptations shared with ligand-binding forms. In the molybdopterin-dependent
oxidoreductases,
the
structural
innovation is in the form of an elaboration of the ancestral ligand-binding features – the extensive inserts resulting in the 3-layered structure with an open barrel-like

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/18

element provide a pocket for the cysteine-attached co-factor as well as the substrate.
In the phosphoribosyl-AMP cyclohydrolases a sequence
alignment and super-position of the conservation onto
the available structures indicates two basic active site elements (see Additional file 1). The first of these is a set of
conserved residues from the insert and the lateral shelf,
which appear to form the basic substrate binding site, as
in other characterized members of the fasciclin-like
assemblage. The second is the active metal-chelating site
formed by 3 conserved cysteines, one from the loop
between the last 2 strands of the core fold and two others
from a C-terminal β-hairpin extension. Further, these proteins form obligate dimers on account of a strand-swapping interaction between the core β-GF and the Cterminal β-hairpin extension [76]. This juxtaposes the
proposed substrate-binding site from one monomer with
the metal-chelating site from the other monomer to form
two distinct equivalent active sites at the dimer interface.
Thus, the emergence of a neomorphic metal-chelating site
on the basic fasciclin-like β-GF scaffold appears to have
been central to the origin of catalysis in this case.
The primary structural innovation in the Nudix hydrolases is the peculiar "outflow" that juts out of strand-2 on
the exposed face (see above). The PXG motif in strand-2
immediately after this "outflow" also provides the space
to accommodate substrates due to a lack of large sidechains. Additional substrate contacting positions also
come from the rest of the exposed face. However, the conserved residues actually required for catalysis do not come
from the exposed face, but from the helical segment and
loop connecting strand-2 to it (Figure 6). This loop contains a conserved motif of the form [DE]xxE (where x is
any amino acid) and the helix itself contains the motif
RExxEE [74,118]. Of these, 4 acidic residues from the two
motifs, excluding the last glutamate of the RExxEE motif,
form a negatively-charged cloud around the arginine, and
appear to be critical for positioning the active site and providing the right polar environment. The last conserved
glutamate projects towards the exposed face and directs
the attack on the scissile diphosphate linkage [118]. The
"outflow" in strand-2 creates the necessary perforation in
the sheet that allows the active glutamate to access the
scissile bond of the substrate bound on the exposed face.
These structural features suggest that in precursors of the
Nudix enzymes the β-GF domain most probably bound
the substrate via the exposed face, as is common in this
fold. The emergence of the "outflow" in strand-2 would
have provided further contacts for substrate interaction
and at the same time created an aperture in the sheet
allowing residues from the helix to form a unique active
site.

Biology Direct 2007, 2:18

Other atypical modes of interactions
A few modes of interactions thus far appear to be
restricted to certain sporadic lineages or are only seen in
certain highly derived forms of the domain. The superantigen/toxin-type and strepto/staphylo-kinase-type β-GF
domains share an unusual general mode of interaction
with plasmin and the T-cell receptor β-chains, respectively. Both appear to contact partners "side-on" via the
edge of the domain on which the additional strand of the
5-stranded versions is situated. A comparable "side-on"
interaction is also seen in the evolutionarily distant 4stranded form of the fold found in the Ig-binding domain.
However, this latter interaction is distinct in having additional extensive contacts supplied by the helical segment
from the obscured face of the domain (Figure 6). It is
unclear if this "side-on' interaction might be another lessknown but ancient interaction feature of the β-GF domain
or has convergently evolved in the superantigen/toxintype and strepto/staphylo-kinase-type domains on one
hand and it the 4-stranded Ig-binding domain on the
other. The interactions of the POZ-domain are rather distinct on account of its extreme structural modification as
well as acquisition of a unique C-terminal helical subdomain. However, the structure of the POZ domain in the
potassium-channel complexed with the oxido-reductase
subunit (PDB: 1EXB [119]) shows that the surface equivalent to the exposed face of the classical β-GF domains
plays an important role in the interactions of the POZ
domain (Figure 6). This suggests that the POZ domain
probably retained at least in part the interaction of the
ancestral β-GF domains.

Discussion and general conclusion

While the β-GF has been thoroughly investigated in the
context of the interactions of ubiquitin and UBLs in
eukaryotes and their prokaryotic relatives like ThiS and
MoaD involved in sulfur transfer, the broader evolutionary history of the fold was poorly understood. We sought
to redress this by developing a natural classification for
the fold and using it as guide for exploring the tempo of
its evolutionary radiations and details of its functional
adaptations. As a result we identified several novel members of the fold, including some distinctive previously
unidentified modifications. The reconstruction of the evolution of the fold suggests that the major structural variants and some of the basic biochemical features and
modes of interaction had emerged prior to LUCA. This
suggests that even before the radiation of the extant lineage of Life there were several rounds of duplication followed by extensive divergence, including major structural
changes.
The scenario emerging from our analysis also suggests that
the earliest reconstructed function of the β-GF domain
was in the context of ribonucleoprotein complexes, prob-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/18

ably as an RNA-binding domain. Based on the functions
of extant versions of the domain, like the TGS superfamily, the IF3-N domain, and early structural derivatives
such as the S4 superfamily, it is quite possible that the earliest versions of the fold played a generic role in a primitive pre-LUCA translation system. Thus, the earliest
diversification events of the β-GF fold likely occurred in
the context of the RNA-world, probably with the acquisition of increasingly specialized roles in the evolving translation apparatus. Amongst the major pre-LUCA
functional shifts were those relating to the biosynthesis of
sulfur-containing compounds and scaffolding of Fe-S
clusters. On the face, such functional shifts from earlier
roles in translation-associated RNPs appear drastic and
puzzling. However, it should be noted that there is a functional connection between the sulfur incorporation pathways of thiamine biosynthesis and thiouridine synthesis
in RNA [88,120]. Hence, it is possible that these shifts
might have occurred in the context of 5-stranded versions
of the β-GF providing scaffolds for the synthesis of thiobase containing RNAs. This reconstruction also implies
that the versions of the β-GF associated with major metabolic functions, including respiratory metabolism, radiated from the ancestral RNA-binding versions.
The major post-LUCA phases of the evolutionary history
of the β-GF fold saw two major spurts of innovation. The
first, occurring primarily in the bacteria, was accompanied
by an extensive exploration of the biochemical function
and interaction space by different versions of the fold.
This was marked by the acquisition of diverse soluble ligand-binding capabilities through distinctive structural
modifications as well as extensive deployment in different
protein-protein interaction contexts. Most notably, the
scaffold on at least 3 independent occasions acquired very
different enzymatic activities even though the β-GF fold
did not ancestrally support catalytic activities. The eukaryotic phase did not see extensive innovation in terms of
fundamentally different biochemical functions, but the
diversity of protein interactions within the ubiquitin-like
superfamily of the 5-stranded assemblage was vastly
expanded through extensive sequence divergence of the
primary interaction surfaces of the superfamily. This
phase was also accompanied by ongoing innovation of
new multi-domain architectures associated with the
eukaryotic expansions of Ub-like signaling domains (Figure 5).
As has been suggested before, the β-GF shows several parallels with the RRM-like fold [34]. Both are relatively
small folds, forming asymmetric 2-layered structures, with
one face of their sheets exposed, and the other partially or
wholly obscured by helical segments. Importantly, when
centered on the β-hairpin element in core of their sheets,
strands in both these domains and one helix show the

Page 20 of 28

Biology Direct 2007, 2:18

same orientation. Both have evolved to provide scaffolds
for a comparable set of diverse biochemical functions,
including RNA-binding, small-molecule or solute recognition, protein-binding, supporting Fe-S clusters (ferredoxins) and providing the skeleton for active sites of very
different enzymes. Both of these folds also appear to have
undergone extensive adaptive radiation even prior to
LUCA after starting off as domains with primitive roles
related to RNA metabolism [121]. These two folds differ
from the ancient α/β3-layered sandwich domains like the
Rossmannoid and P-loop NTPase domains, which appear
to have begun their existence as enzymatic domains and
more-or-less retained a conserved set of basic biochemical
activities throughout their evolution [121,122]. The versatility of the β-GF and RRM-like folds in providing scaffolds for both enzymatic and diverse non-enzymatic
function might be attributable in part to two major factors: 1) an issue of contingency – these folds simply arose
very early in evolution and had the time to colonize
numerous functional roles. 2) Favorable structures – their
relatively large sheet that is exposed on one side provides
an interface for diverse interactions, especially in the form
of binding various substrates. Sequence alteration to this
binding surface, without disrupting the overall scaffold,
could easily allow the emergence of a great diversity of
new interactions. Secondly, the presence of the large sheet
with just a single helical segment also favors formation of
barrel-like structures, thereby opening new faces for interactions.
Despite intense investigations the precise functions of several eukaryotic Ubls remain unclear. More generally, the
functional details of the non-ubiquitin-like members of
the fold remain less studied, as in the case of the β-GF
domains in RNP complexes which are in need of more
detailed investigations. In conclusion, we hope that our
analysis of the β-GF domain provides a new framework
for further systematic experimental exploration of the
functions of this fold.

Methods
The non-redundant (NR) database of protein sequences
(National Center for Biotechnology Information, NIH,
Bethesda, MD) was searched with the BLASTP program
[52]. Profile searches were conducted using the PSI-BLAST
program [52] with either single sequences or multiple
alignments as queries, with a profile inclusion expectation
(e) value threshold of 0.01; searched were iterated until
convergence. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) built from
alignments using the hmmbuild program were also
employed in searches carried out using the hmmsearch
program from the HMMER package [123]. For queries and
searches containing compositionally biased segments, the
statistical correction option built into the BLAST program
was used [124]. Multiple alignments were constructed

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/18

using the MUSCLE [125] and/or T-COFFEE programs
[126], followed by manual adjustment based on PSIBLAST hsp results and information provided by solved
three-dimensional structures. All large-scale sequence and
structure analysis procedures were carried out with the
TASS software package (V. Anantharaman, SB and LA,
unpublished results), a successor to the SEALS package
[127]. Protein structures were visualized using the SwissPDB viewer [128] and cartoons were constructed with the
PyMOL program [129]. Protein secondary structure predictions were made with the JPRED program [53], using
multiple alignments as queries. Phylogenetic analysis was
carried out using a variety of methods including maximum-likelihood, neighbor-joining, and minimum evolution (least squares) methods. Maximum-likelihood
distance matrices were constructed using the TreePuzzle 5
program [130] and were used as input for the construction of neighbor-joining with the Weighbor program
[131]. Additionally, trees were constructed using the
neighbor-joining and minimum evolution methods as
implemented in the MEGA program [132] and the Bayesian inference method using Markov chain Monte Carlo
simulations implemented by the MRBAYES program
[133].
Structure similarity searches were conducted using the
standalone version of the DALI program [54,55] with the
query structures scanned against local current version PDB
that has all chains as separate entries. The structural hits
for each query was collected, even if the DALI Z-score for
the match was less than 2.0 and parsed for topological
congruence to the β-GF template (Table 1) using a custom
PERL script. To assess topologically congruence, coordinates of the matching regions detected by DALI searches
using known β-GF domains as queries were extracted and
analyzed for secondary structure using DSSP program.
These secondary structure elements were then represented
as a string (corresponding to a row in table 1) along with
the polarity of the secondary structure element determined from the DALI match to the query structure. These
strings were then matched with the equivalent secondary
structure pattern strings constructed of bona fide β-grasp
domains. If a complete match was obtained these structures were tagged as congruent, while those which were
not were ranked in descending order of elements that did
not match. This discrimination of the potential candidates
was further confirmed by visual examination of each
structure. The interacting residues of various proteins of βgrasp fold with their interacting molecules have been
deduced using custom made PERL scripts. The scripts
encode interacting distance cut-off values of 5.0 Å and 3.5
Å between appropriate atoms in 3-D for deducing the
hydrophobic and polar interactions respectively. These
inferred interactions were further examined manually
using Swiss-PDB viewer for confirming the contacts

between amino-acid residues of β-grasp fold proteins and
atomic groups of interacting partners.

Reviewer's report 1
Igor B. Zhulin, Oak Ridge National Laboratory and University of Tennessee, USA
The current study is related to the previous work by the
authors reporting a novel domain superfamily within the
β-grasp fold (Biology Direct 2007, 2:4). In this investigation, authors launched a large-scale exploration of the βgrasp fold diversity and evolution. This is an important,
but daunting task, because the fold is well populated and
comprises divergent domain families. In my opinion,
both strengths and weaknesses of the paper are resulting
from this fact.
Strengths
The main strength of this paper is systematic and logical
classification of the fold, defining its core elements and
linking numerous elaborations to functional diversity.
This is well done by using an array of computational techniques interrogating both sequence and structure. Natural
classification of protein folds and domains is urgently
needed, thus this work makes a significant contribution to
the field. An important element of this study is uncovering
several novel domain groups. For example, I was intrigued
by the finding that flagellar hook-filament junction proteins FlgL and FlgK are related to the flagellar cap protein
FliD comprising a new version of the 5-stranded β-GF
clade, Spatial distribution and function of these proteins
in the flagellar assembly are quite similar; however, their
relatedness in sequence or structure has never been demonstrated before. I am certain that other facts unearthed in
this work may draw attention of other specialists studying
various systems involving β-GF proteins.
Weakness
In my opinion, the weakness of this manuscript is in its
organization. Potentially, this can be improved, although
I keep the door open for a counterargument by not providing constructive suggestions on how to do that.
Because there is such a large body of information, its
organization is important. As for any scientific contribution, it is imperative to identify what is the status quo in
the field and what has been done by the investigators to
advance our knowledge. This particular paper is written as
mix of a thorough literature review (there are 162 references!) and an original study. The purpose of the former
is (hopefully) to synthesize novel ideas/leads from
numerous known facts, whereas the purpose of the latter
is to generate novel facts filling the gaps in knowledge.
This paper does both, but it is does not effectively separates
the two. If one wants to know exactly which facts are
newly discovered (and there are many of them!), it will

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/18

take some time... Ideally, all information pertinent to the
known facts should be introduced in the Introduction and
Discussion, whereas Results should show clearly what
new information has been obtained in this study. I think
combining Results and Discussion in one section creates
this feeling that known and novel facts are mashed
together. I know that it is much easier for authors to
present such a complex study in this way, but the trade-off
is the lack of above mentioned distinction. One suggestion on improving the overall organization of the current
scheme is to introduce numerical headings and subheadings. For example, in the current version of the manuscript
the reader is left to wonder whether "Basal versions of the
β-GF" is a subheading of "Natural classification of
domains" or they are equal headings, and so on. Having
1., 1.1, 1.1.1. system should help to see the logic of the
story better.
Author response
Given the intricate connection between the results and inferences drawn from them, we felt it better to combine the Results
and Discussion sections to avoid redundancy. We have now
reworded the text to more clearly differentiate the discoveries
presented in our work from those that are already known.
Accordingly, we have also revised the heading style and added
subheadings, where appropriate to improve clarity. While we
could have used a numbered style for greater clarity as recommended by the referee this scheme does not fit into Biology
Direct's manuscript style.
Neutral feeling
Essentially half of the manuscript is devoted to developing a scenario for the fold evolution. This scenario is certainly plausible, as there are no obvious flaws or
contradictions. One the other hand, the starting point of
inferring relationships is structural information and so is
the end point of their verification. I might be wrong here,
but this is the feeling. I wish we would have an independent method (or better methods) of testing these relationships more rigorously.
Author response
Given the small size of the domain, the absence of catalytic,
active site residues and the level of sequence divergence several
superfamilies of the β-grasp fold can only be unified by structural features. As a result, shared structural features are a principal guide for developing the evolutionary at a higher level
scenario. However, as mentioned in the text, we also used distance trees based on pairwise Z-scores of structural comparisons
to infer evolutionary relationships between different superfamilies. Our final classification is thus a parsimonious reconstruction that includes information obtained in both these
methods. Thus, what is presented is a phylogenetic hypothesis
that is amenable to future falsification. The utility of this phylogenetic hypothesis is in developing a framework for exploring

Page 22 of 28

Biology Direct 2007, 2:18

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/18

emergence of various properties of different superfamilies of the
fold. We do appreciate the referee's concern for the means for
independent falsification of the presented hypothesis. We
believe these do exist even if not straight forward: 1) Availability of new structures can allow testing of the suggested scenarios
to present evidence for and against the scenario presented here.
2) The scenario presented here makes predictions of certain
functional properties such as binding interfaces and substrates
that explicitly stem from the phylogenetic analysis. Testing these
predictions allows a test of the underlying scenario.
Specific comments

Throughout the paper, consider changing "hits" to
"matches" in the context of BLAST searches: "hit" used to
have a special technical meaning, e.g. "using the two-hit
method to trigger ungapped extensions".
Author response
We admit this possibility of potential misunderstanding and
make the suggested change.

Pg 5 of the pdf, 4th ln from the bottom: what is "topological similarity search"? It is not defined in M&M.
Pg 6, par 2, ln 8. What is "congruence to the unique topological template", how such congruence was evaluated,
and what if something is "incongruent"?
Author response
We have added a description of this procedure to the Materials
and Methods. We now describe how congruence was evaluated.

Pg 7 ln 5–6. Conserved pattern of hydrophobic interactions in the core is said to strongly support its monophyletic origin. I am wondering what is the null
hypothesis and the burden of proof here: surely, there are
also some weakly conserved and non-conserved hydrophobic interactions – are there more of them than the
conserved ones? If so, do they reject the hypothesis of the
monophyletic origin? Is there any test that can reject such
a hypothesis for proteins with a shared fold?

Author response
With respect to ancient folds (which were already definitely
present in LUCA, like β-GF) there are two main scenarios, both
of which based on our current understanding are possible: 1)
Monogenesis of all ancient folds, or at least major subsets of
them, like the α+β two layered fold category to which the β-GF,
RRM, ASCR etc belong.2) Polygenesis in which various distinct
α+β two layered folds have independently arisen and convergently adopted similar general structural features. If the former
were the case, then the hypothesis of domains not sharing a fold
cannot be rejected in an absolute sense. However, one could still
define exclusive monophyletic groups.Under both scenarios we
believe that the null hypothesis would be that non-monophyly
(or exclusive monophyly) of two or more distinct domains with
the burden of proof being the need provide evidence for their
exclusive monophyly. Under both scenarios an exclusive monophyletic group or a distinct fold would have a unique conserved
network of hydrophobic interactions. This concept is an extension of a monophyletic protein superfamily defined based on
sequence similarity: the superfamily has a distinctive constellation of conserved set of residues – similarly, there are distinct
conserved networks of hydrophobic residues that are present in
the β-GF or the RRM fold. Just as in the sequence alignment
the presence of many non-conserved positions does not reject the
monophyly of the aligned sequences, there being many non-conserved interactions in the hydrophobic network does not reject
the monophyly of domains with a shared fold. However, the
absence of the conserved network characteristic of a fold in
domain casts doubt on its belonging to the fold. This is especially so, if there are notable structural differences and a hydrophobic network that corresponds to some other fold. For
example the BtrG-like proteins (1vkb A) and the tRNA ribosyltransferase-isomerase 1vky B show some general similarity with
the β-GF. However, they lack the conserved hydrophobic core
shared by the β-GF. The former has instead emerged from an
internal repeat of simpler units and the later might be interpreted as distinct barrel with different stabilizing interactions.
Hence with current data these are rejected as members of the
β-grasp fold.

Pg 12 par 3: "The strong conservation of this unique structural feature as well as the exclusive grouping of these versions in structure similarity-based clustering": are those
indeed two independent lines of evidence, or is the latter
a direct consequence of the former?
Author response
We did not imply anywhere that these two are entirely independent forms of evidence. We agree that the presence of a
shared strand does contribute to increasing the structural similarity of the 5-stranded group. However, their clustering based
structural similarity Z-scores does not exclusively depend on the
presence of that additional strand alone. There are other more
subtle, or "distributed" elements of similarity, which contribute
to their exclusive clustering. In an experiment in which a rep-

resentative was chosen from each lineage in figure 3, the strand
5 left out, and then clustered using the MUSTANG program we
still recover their exclusive grouping supporting the above-stated
contention.

some of their results publicly available in electronic form
(for example, protein segments annotated with the classification from this work or subfamily alignments) as supplement to this paper.

Pg 15 par 2: What is "principle of phylogenetic bracketing"? If it is the same as "Extant Phylogenetic Bracket"
attributed to L. Witmer, then this is not a suitable method
for inferring ancestral function, in particular when it is
distributed sporadically in the extant lineages.

Author response
Within the provided additional file is a super alignment including many major families within the classical ubiquitin superfamily, as well as individual alignments of all newly-discovered
β-GF domains. Additionally, we have provided the protein
identifier (gi) numbers along with a brief description of all
sequences (including organism name and lineage in which the
sequence is found) for all identified families of the β-GF.

Author response
Witmer's extant phylogenetic bracketing is used to infer a feature of an extinct clade which is bracketed by the features in two
extant clades with the underlying assumption of the parsimony
principle. We do not imply the above on page 15, but admit
that our usage of the term would result in confusion with the
above. Accordingly, we modify the discussion in this regard to
avoid using the potentially confusing term "phylogenetic bracketing".

Text and Fig. 3: it is perhaps unadvisable to call POZ, IGB
and BofC "basal versions"
Author response
The reviewer is absolutely correct, we in no way intended to
refer to these lineages as basal versions, but rather sporadic versions potentially derived from more widely distributed 4stranded versions. We have altered to text and the label in Fig.
3to represent this point more accurately.

Pg 31 ln 6 of M&M: it is "compositionally biased" not
"computationally biased".

Minor issues
1) last sentence of last paragraph of section "Identification
of β-GF domains"

Some quantitative data illustrating the comparisons of
distributions of previously characterized domains would
be desirable. The statement that the majority of conserved
lineages has been determined is very strong and depends
on the upper level of allowed sequence and structural
deviation.
Author response
We now write, "a significant fraction" instead of majority. We
have also referred to a previous work on the matter.

2) The reader might be offended to find the definition of
domain architectural complexity only in the figure legend
of Fig. 5. It would be better placed into the main text.

Author response
We have made the correction.

Author response
We have moved the definition of the complexity quotient from
the figure legend to the main text.

Additional material

Frank Eisenhaber, Institute of Molecular Pathology,

The work by Burroughs et al. is a careful, virtually encyclopedically complete collection of β-GF protein segments in
sequence databases and a meticulous analysis of the associated structural and functional knowledge in the literature. For the reviewer, it was especially interesting to
follow the discussion of the authors how the splitting of
evolutionary lines was associated with critical evolutionary events (pre- and post-LUCA distinction, emergence of
kingdoms) and how the functional capabilities of the fold
got realized during history of life and how they are associated with elaborations of the basic fold.
