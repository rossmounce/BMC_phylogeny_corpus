Genetic drift evolution under vaccination
pressure among H5N1 Egyptian isolates
Ahmed S Abdel-Moneim1,2*, Manal A Afifi3 and Magdy F El-Kady4

Background: The highly pathogenic H5N1 is a major avian pathogen that intensively affects the poultry industry
in Egypt even in spite of the adoption of vaccination strategy. Antigenic drift is among the strategies the influenza
virus uses to escape the immune system that might develop due to the pressure of extensive vaccination. H5N1
mutates in an intensified manner and is considered a potential candidate for the possible next pandemic with all
the catastrophic consequences such an eventuality will entail.
Methods: H5N1 was isolated from the pooled organ samples of four different affected flocks in specific pathogen
free embryonated chicken eggs (SPF-ECE). A reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was
performed to the haemagglutingin and neuraminidase. Sequencing of the full length haemagglutingin was
performed. Sequence analyses of the isolated strains were performed and compared to all available H5N1 from
Egyptian human and avian strains in the flu database. Changes in the different amino acid that may be related to
virus virulence, receptor affinity and epitope configuration were assigned and matched with all available Egyptian
strains in the flu database.
Results: One out of the four strains was found to be related to the B2 Egyptian lineage, 2 were related to A1
lineage and the 4th was related to A2 lineage. Comparing data obtained from the current study by other available
Egyptian H5N1 sequences remarkably demonstrates that amino acid changes in the immune escape variants are
remarkably restricted to a limited number of locations on the HA molecule during antigenic drift. Molecular
diversity in the HA gene, in relevance to different epitopes, were not found to follow a regular trend, suggesting
abrupt cumulative sequence mutations. However a number of amino acids were found to be subjected to high
mutation pressure.
Conclusion: The current data provides a comprehensive view of HA gene evolution among H5N1 subtype viruses
in Egypt. Egyptian H5N1-AIVs are constantly undergoing genetic changes and reveal a complex pattern of drifts.
These findings raise the concerns about the value of using influenza vaccines in correlation with the development
of antigenic drift in influenza epidemics.

Background
The highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus is currently
panzootic in Egyptian poultry populations and crosses
species barriers to humans and animals. H5N1 viruses
are classified into 10 distinct initial clades (numbered 09) based on the HA gene [1]. H5N1 virus strains from
European-Middle Eastern-African (EMA) origin were

assigned to three clades (EMA-1-3) [2] and referred to
as sub-clades 2.2.1.-2.2.3 [3]. Egyptian H5N1 viruses
were exclusively classified as clade 2.2.1, which were
further subdivided into two major groups A (A1-A5)
and B (B1-B2) [4]. Following the widespread of HPAI
H5N1 in Egypt, authorities began culling and vaccination to control the spread of the disease in poultry.
H5N1 and several H5N2 inactivated vaccines were
imported in a trial to control the H5N1 in Egypt. Nevertheless, it still endemic in the country and continues to
constitute a major challenge to poultry population. The

long-term pattern of endemic status increases the
opportunity for the emergence of potential pandemic
strains through further adaptation by genetic mutation
or reassortment [5]. The HA gene is a target of neutralizing antibodies and a classic example of an antigenically drifting protein [6]where a large number of
point mutations accumulate in the epitope regions or
antibody combining regions [7]. Antigenic drift at the
epitope regions represents the most important hindrance to vaccine development since an effective vaccination is possible only when the epidemic strain
matches with the vaccine strain [8]. In additions, suboptimal vaccination strategies could result in enhanced
antigenic drift accelerated by the immune pressure
due to prior immunization exerted on the replicating
viruses and continuous interspecies and intraspecies
transmission [9]. However, it is generally accepted that
the highly error-prone replication of influenza viruses
and viral genome reassortment enhance the robustness
of an efficient evolutionary capacity of the virus
[10,11]
In the present paper, we isolated and characterized
four H5N1 strains from Egyptian commercial chicken
farms to get a deep insight into possible intra- and
inter-subtype sequence variations. The genetic and phylogenetic properties of these viruses were determined
and compared to each other and to all available Egyptian published sequences in the flu database to determine the vigor of the mutational events of HA. We
tried to address the mutations change over time in HA
in correlation to their functional impact.

Materials and methods
Virus isolation

Liver, spleen and proventriculus organ samples were
collected from succumbed birds from four infected
poultry farms (F7-F10) in three different Governorates
(Fayoum, Qaluobiya and Giza). Birds in all farms
received the H5N2 or H5N1 vaccine 2-3 weeks before
developing the characteristic signs of the disease. Organs
were routinely processed individually, infected materials
were pooled for each farm, centrifuged at 500 × g for 10
min. and gentamicin sulfate solution (50 mg/ml) was
added prior to inoculation into the allantoic cavity of
five, 10-day-SPF-ECE (100 μl/egg). Inoculated embryos
were incubated at 37°C for 24-48 hrs.
Haemagglutination

The allantoic fluid of pooled infected embryos from
each sample (F7-F10) was subjected to haemagglutination in 25-μl volume in 96-well HI plates. Two fold
serial dilution of the infected allantoic fluid was performed for each sample. Equal volumes of 1% suspension of chicken erythrocytes were dispensed to each well

[12]. Isolates possessed HA titers ≥ 3 log 2 were suspected to be positive. The microtiter plate was left at
room temperature until the negative control well exhibited a tight well circumscribed button of unagglutinated
sedimented cells. The result of each sample was numerically reported.
Avian influenza virus antigen detection

The allantoic fluid that showed haemagglutination was
screened for AIV group and H5 antigens using the rapid
chromatographic strip test (Animal Genetic Inc. Korea)
according to manufacturer instructions.
Viral RNA extraction and RT PCR

Viral RNA was extracted from virus containing the
chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) homogenate of each
sample using a SV Total RNA Isolation System (Promega Corporation, Madison, Wis.). RT-PCR amplification for the full length of both NA and HA genes of
H5N1 were performed using the Verso™ 1 step RT
PCR (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). While a single set
of primers flanking 1345 bp was used for NA[13], for
HA, four sets of primers, flanking overlapping regions of
the full length gene, were used (Table 1).
Sequencing

RT-PCR amplicons were subjected to electrophoresis in
1% agarose gel. HA specific bands were excised and purified with the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). Each
purified RT-PCR products was sequenced directly in
both forward and reverse directions (Macrogen, Korea).
Sequences were trimmed to remove amplicon primerlinker sequence and assembled. All sequence data used
in this study are available in the GenBank database
(Accession No: JF357720-JF357723).

Multiple sequence analysis and phylogenetic tree

Comparative analyses were performed using the CLUSTAL W multiple sequence alignment program, Mega
4.1 [14]. AIV representative sequences used for the
alignments were obtained from the GenBank and EMBL
databases. The phylogenetic tree was constructed by
using the neighbour-joining method with Kimura twoparameter distances by using the Mega 4.1. The reliability of internal branches was assessed by 1000 bootstrap
replications and the p-distance substitution model. Nlinked potential glycosylation sites were analyzed with
the NetNglyc server with predicted threshold values
above 0.5[15].
Deduced amino acid sequence analysis

We analyzed the HA deduced amino acid sequences of
4 isolated strains (F7-F10) and compared them with
Egyptian H5N1 isolates available in the flu database. We
used a complete collection of 315 H5N1 avian strains
isolated from 2006 to 2010 in Egypt (2006 [n = 37],
2007 [n = 78], 2008 [n = 82], 2009 [n = 74], 2010[n =
44]), as well as 97 Egyptian human isolates, in order to
screen the sites that had undergone amino acid intensive
changes in recently determined different epitopes [16].
Amino acid residues associated with mammalian virulence were also screened. Amino acid residues were
examined in the flu database [17].
Building 3D model

The SWISS MODEL service was utilized to build the 3D
models for the HA protein of F7-F10 isolates, by finding
the exact templates. The PDB files were exposed by
using the module of the Molsoft Internal Coordinate
Mechanics (ICM-Pro) software.

Results and discussion
In the current study, four H5N1 strains were isolated
from infected poultry broiler farms suffering from
respiratory distress and variable mortalities; 2 from
northern Egypt (Ismalia [F9] and Qaluobiya [F10]) and 2
from Middle Egypt (Fayoum Governorate [F7] and [F8]).
The strains were isolated from pool organ samples that
were inoculated in the SPF-ECE. All embryos died 2448 hrs post inoculation. The infected allantoic fluid
showed 3-4 haemagglutination log2 titers when tested
with chicken RBC. The allantoic fluids reacted positively
with chromatographic group and H5 antigen detecting
strips. The RT-PCR for both HA and NA genes of
H5N1 were found positive (data not shown). The present phylogenetic analysis, based on the analysis of the
HA gene, showed that the cumulative genetic drifts in
the HA gene clustered Egyptian isolates into two main
lineages (A[A1-A5] and B[B1-B5]) (Figure 1). F7, A/
chicken/Egypt/F7/2009 and F8, A/chicken/Egypt/F8/

Page 3 of 8

2009 were found to be related to lineage A1; F9 (A/
chicken/Egypt/F9/2009) to lineage A2; and F10 (A/
chicken/Egypt/F10/2009) to lineage B2 (Figure 1). Eight
amino acid substitutions were found in the variant F10
(Figure 2) and other Egyptian variants in lineage B at
the amino acid positions P74S, D 97N, H110R (epitope
A), S123P, R140G (epitope B) and antigenic site), F144Y
(epitope B), N165H (glycosylation site) and A184E.
The variability of amino acid in the 5 epitopes (A-E)
[16] for the isolates under investigation and other available Egyptian sequences (2006-2010) in different years
were screened. Residues, 43 (E epitope), 71 (E epitope),
110 (A epitope), 129 (A epitope and receptor binding
site), 140 (B epitope), 141 (B epitope), 144 (B epitope),
151 (D epitope), 154 (D epitope, and glycosylation site),
185 (D epitope), 192 (D epitope) and 226 (D epitope)
were subjected to high mutational pressure (Table 2).
F7 and F8 viruses and other viruses in the A1 group
showed a conspicuous deletion of amino acid 129 in the
HA protein (H5 numbering) (Table 2). The amino acid
residue number 129 (S in F9 and L in F10) is located in
the epitope A (Table 2) and part of the receptor binding
site and also belongs to an antigenic site [16]. The 129
deletion was not present in the ancestor A/Goose/
Guangdong/1/96 strain [18] or in the H5N1 viruses originally introduced into Egypt in 2006. S129L substitution and 129 deletion were detected in 2007 (L in 6/78
isolates and deletion in 6/78 isolates), 2008 (L in 16/82,
deletion in 0/82), 2009(deletion in 36/74, L 22/74) and
2010 (deletion in 26/44 and L in 18/44) (Table 2). Serine at site 129 is a receptor-binding site for a-2,3-linked
sialic acids. Previously, it was reported that a mutation
at this site (S129L) decreased virulence of HPAIV H5N1
in mice [19]. However, a structural study on the H5N1
HA has reported that change from serine to leucine
facilitates access to a-2,6-linked sialic acids [20]. The
129S deletion was not detected in the 2006 human isolates (0/16), however, in 2007-2010, the 129 deletion
was detected in (5/24) of 2007, (2/6) of 2008, (31/34) of
2009 and (12/12) 2010 human cases. Isolates from nonhuman mammals (equine, n = 1) like those in the
majority of human in 2009 and 2010 possessed the 129deletion. Interestingly, there was a similar deletion in
the HA protein at the corresponding position of all
human seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 viruses. It should be
noted that this position is close to a domain modulating
receptor interaction. Likewise, it is also interesting that
strains with this deletion seem to evolve towards a
receptor usage that is similar to human H1N1[21].
The deduced amino acid exchanges, as with most
H5N1 Egyptian strains, are distributed across the HA
protein and are found in the polybasic cleavage motif,
whose consensus sequence is PGERRRKKR/GLF for
clade 2.2 viruses. All the isolated strains possessed a

parent ones (F7-F9) shown in yellow; (P74S, D97N, H110R, S123P, R140G, F144Y, N165H, A184E). The majority of these sites are exterior

multibasic HA0 amino acid cleavage sequence characteristic for the highly pathogenic H5N1 strains clade 2.2.
While the sequence diversity of the haemagglutinin
open reading frame of F7 and F8 had cleavage site of
the consensus of 2.2, F10 PQGEGRRKKR/GLF showed
(R325G) substitution and F9 showed two amino acid
substitutions in the cleavage site PQGKSRRKKR/GLF,
(E324K and R325S). All variations within the polybasic
cleavage motif probably do not affect cleavage of the
HA precursor molecule since F7-F10 have the RX(K/R)
R consensus motif, for the cleavage by furin or the subtilisin-like protein convertases [22] which remains conserved. The significance of the change in the cleavage
site, however, remains to be understood.
The HA sequences contained different N-linked
potential glycosylation sites, F10 had eight potential sites
at the following positions: 11, 23, 72, 236, 273, 286, 484
and 543. F7 and F8 possess 6 sites, at 11, 23, 164, 285,
483, 542 whereas F9 possessed only 5 sites at 23, 165,
286, 484, 543. F10 acquired two additional glycosylation
sites (72 [epitope E] and 236 [polybasic cleavage site])
but lost a glycosylation site at165 that was located near
the epitope D. F9 lost the glycosylation site at 11 position (H5 Numbering).
Lycett et al. specified 6 amino acid residues (86V,
124S, L/N138, T/S156, E/R212, T263) that are linked to
the virulence of H5N1 in mammals [23]. T156 and
T263 were also present in F10. V86 was also present in
1/78 (2007), 1/82 (2008),5/74 (2009) isolates but none of
the human isolates. T156 was present in 16/82, 23/74
and 17/44 of avian isolates in 2008, 2009 and 2010

isolates respectively, however it was present in 1/94
human isolates (A/Egypt/3300-NAMRU3/2008). T263
was present in F7-F10 isolates in addition to all human
and 314/315 avian isolates (Table 3). On the other hand,
while S129L and A156T substitutions were found to be
associated with viral adaptation to poultry [24], both
substitutions were found in F10 isolate.
The K189R amino acid substitution at the receptorbinding site was reported as an escape mutant change
[25] and was further clearly shown to be significantly
antigenic [19]. Only, 4/315 isolates of the Egyptian GenBank sequences showed K189 while K189R was present
in the F7-F10 isolates as well as 92/94 human and 296/
315 avian Egyptian strains. Accordingly, it does not
seem to be linked to escape mutants in the Egyptian
strains. Duvvuri et al., analyzed potential mutational
changes in L138Q, R140K and A156T [16]. The amino
acids at sites 138 and 140 were involved in the carbohydrate specificity of HA molecule towards host receptor
[26]. L138Q was present in the F7-F10, 80/82 of 2008
isolates, 72/74 of 2009 isolates and 42/44 of 2010 isolates and all human strains. On the other hand, R140K
substation was present in only 8/78 of 2007 avian isolates but none of the human strains.
HA2 29E (H5 numbering 359) was detected in the F7F10 isolates (Figure 2) and in all Egyptian human and
avian isolates other than the A/chicken/Egypt/34-2/2008
and the A/chicken/Egypt/3046NAMRU3-CLEVB62/
2007. All viruses in clade 1 and 2 possessed E29 in the
HA2 subunit. The K29E substitution resulted in loss of
a proteasomal cleavage site. The Glu-29 in the HA2

Numerical superscripts denote the number of isolates that possess the specified amino acid residue.
V superscript denotes a residue that has been found to be associated with an increase in the virulence of H5N1 to mammals.

subunit may have been helpful to H5N1 viruses since
such change induced the loss of one proteasomal cleavage site, which means that the virus can provoke a
lower cytotoxic T cell response [27]. All human and
avian strains possessed E359 with the exception of two
isolates; A/chicken/Egypt/3046NAMRU3-CLEVB62/
2007 and A/chicken/Egypt/34-2/2008, which possessed
K359 and N359 respectively.

Conclusions
Egypt is a good candidate of the study of AIV genetic
evolution under high vaccination pressure as there is a
high avian population density, significant inter-species
and intra-species transmission and as the vaccination
has been a regular veterinary practice since 2006. We
identified several important differences in HA gene from
the 4 H5N1 strains under investigation and the available
Egyptian H5N1 sequences in the flu database and

specified amino acids substitutions that: distinguished
variant from classical parent strains, those linked to the
virulence of H5N1 in mammals, and those present in
different HA epitopes. The HA of the Egyptian H5N1
strains was found to undergo intensive genetic changes
in a complex pattern. It has been speculated that the
avian influenza vaccination has resulted in accelerated
genetic drifts in the HA gene sequence [28]. Nevertheless, other researchers have suggested that viral replication, per se, allows for the expression of drifts among
subsequent viral populations [29-31]. The presence of
mutant strain, that could replicate and shed in spite of
vaccination and possesses amino acid substitutions
linked to virulence in mammals, necessitates the importance of employing more rigorous requisites than those
being utilized by the World Organization of Animal
Health (OIE) which only considers protection afforded
by the vaccine in terms of bird survival rates.
