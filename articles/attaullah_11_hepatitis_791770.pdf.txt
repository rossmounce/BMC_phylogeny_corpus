Hepatitis C virus genotypes in Pakistan:
a systemic review
Sobia Attaullah1*, Sanaullah Khan2 and Ijaz Ali3

Abstract
Background and aim: Phylogenetic analysis has led to the classification of hepatitis C virus (HCV) into 1-6 major
genotypes. HCV genotypes have different biological properties, clinical outcome and response to antiviral
treatment and provide important clues for studying the epidemiology, transmission and pathogenesis. This article
deepens the current molecular information about the geographical distribution of HCV genotypes and
subgenotypes in population of four provinces of Pakistan. 34 published papers (1996-2011) related to prevalence of
HCV genotypes/serotypes and subgenotypes in Pakistan were searched.
Result: HCV genotype/s distribution from all 34 studies was observed in 28,400 HCV infected individuals in the
following pattern: 1,999 (7.03%) cases of genotype 1; 1,085 (3.81%) cases of genotype 2; 22,429 (78.96%) cases of
genotype 3; 453 (1.59%) cases of genotype 4; 29 (0.10%) cases of genotype 5; 37 (0.13%) cases of genotype 6;
1,429 (5.03%) cases of mixed genotypes, and 939 (3.30%) cases of untypeable genotypes. Overall, genotype 3a was
the predominant genotype with a rate of 55.10%, followed by genotype 1a, 3b and mixed genotype with a rate of
10.25%, 8.20%, and 5.08%, respectively; and genotypes 4, 5 and 6 were rare. Genotype 3 occurred predominately in
all the provinces of Pakistan. Second more frequently genotype was genotype 1 in Punjab province and
untypeable genotypes in Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan provinces.
Keywords: HCV, Genotypes, Prevalence, Pakistan

Background
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, the sole member of the
genus Hepacivirus, in the family Flaviviridae [1], is a global public health problem [1-3] and is accountable for the
second most common cause of viral hepatitis [4]. Pakistani
HCV serofrequency figures are significantly higher (4.7%,
varying from 0.4%-33.7%) when compared to the corresponding populations in surrounding countries like India
(0.66%), Nepal (1.0), Myanmar (2.5%), Iran (0.87%) [5],
China (1%) [6] and Afghanistan (1.1%) [7].
HCV has been recognized to be both hepatotropic and
lymphotropic virus [8]. The complete HCV genome was
determined by Choo et al in 1991 and the consensual
international classification was made in 1994 [6]. HCV
genome is comprised of linear single stranded RNA
molecule of positive polarity of ~9.6 kb [1]. The RNA
encodes a large polyprotein of about 3,000 amino acids

in a single continuous open reading frame (ORF) which
is flanked at the 5’ and 3’ ends by nontranslated regions
(5’ UTR) [1,2,9]. The ORF comprised of 3 structural
genes (C, E1, E2) and 4 nonstructural genes (NS2, NS3,
NS4 and NS5) [2,9]. Mutation rate are different in different region of HCV genome. High rate of mutation occur
in two region of Envelop E2 glycoprotein, designated
hyper variable region 1 and 2 [10]. Of the genome,
5’UTR, the most highly conserved region and thus has
been used is most laboratories to develop sensitive detection assays for HCV RNA [2,9]. RNA exhibits a significant genetic, heterogeneity with nucleotide substitution
rate of 1.44 × 10-3 and 1.92 × 10-3 per site per year [11].
HCV isolates show four levels of genetic variability:
types (65.7% - 68.9% nucleotide sequence identities of full
length sequences), subtypes (76.9% - 80.1% nucleotide
sequence identities of full length sequences), isolates, and
quasispecies (90.8%- 99% nucleotide sequence identities of
full length sequences) [6]. Epidemiologically and clinically
HCV is classified into 11 genotypes and more than 100
subtypes designated as a, b, c. etc. [1,6,12]. It has been

regarded that genotypes 7 through 11 should be consider
as variants of the same group and classified as a single
genotype, type 6 [13,14].
Genetic heterogeneity is an outstanding feature of HCV
and this may have important implications in diagnosis,
pathogenesis, treatment, and vaccine development. The
determination of HCV genotypes, subtypes and isolates
has been helpful in understanding the evolution and the
epidemiology of the HCV, and is an important factor in
the pretreatment evaluation of patients [8,15,16]. The
HCV genotypes show a distinctive geographical distribution [6,9,15]. The global epidemiology of the HCV genotypes is shown in Table 1 [13,14].
In Pakistan, few studies have been conducted in order
to figure out the distribution of various HCV genotypes.
This study initiated to find out the molecular epidemiology of various HCV genotypes and subtypes present
across the country in all four provinces of Pakistan.

Literature search
Literature was searched and reviewed in 2011 to summarize scientific reports on distribution, prevalence and epidemiology of HCV genotypes in Pakistan. Articles indexed
in the PubMed database and google scholar. Papers published during years 1996 to 2011 were searched by using
the following key words: HCV, hepatitis C virus genotypes,
epidemiology, prevalence, Pakistan.
A total of 34 original articles on HCV genotype in Pakistan were found; they covered all four provinces. Altogether 28,400 HCV affected individuals were reported in
these articles. In this study, 3,887 cases of positive HCV
individuals were investigated from Punjab, 2,868 cases
from Sindh, 1,200 cases from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (formerly NWFP) and 152 individuals was available from Balochistan, while 20,417 individuals were investigated from
different parts of Pakistan (Table 2).
Discussion and Conclusion
HCV has come to the top of virus-induced liver diseases
in many parts of the world and has gained endemic

proportions in our population but there is no national
data collection system for evaluation of genotypes of
HCV infection. The data on geographic distribution of
genotypes of HCV is among largest of its kind from
Pakistan. This is perhaps the first study done in area of
geographic distribution of genotypes of HCV in all four
provinces of Pakistan. Pakistan is situated in the western
part of the Indian subcontinent, with Afghanistan and
Iran on the west, India on the east, and the Arabian Sea
on the south. This geographical situation, mass immigration and illegal drug traffic from Afghanistan,
absence of good preventive measures in the past e.g.
extensive reuse of non-sterilized syringes, fragile health
structure, unscreened blood transfusion, use of contaminated razor by barber, general poverty and poor education have all affected epidemiology of HCV in our
country. Pakistan consists of four provinces; Balochistan
is geographically largest of four provinces but has smallest population; Punjab is second largest province and
has largest population, Sindh is third largest province
geographically and KPK is geographically the smallest of
four provinces, which is bordered on to the west by
Afghanistan. The immigration of populations from
countries of high endemicity of the infection seems to
contribute significantly to the rapid modification of epidemiological data, especially in areas bearing the high
burden of immigrants.
Genotype 1 was accounted 7.03% of the cases and subtype 1a predominated with a rate of 4.82%. Genotype 2
had frequency of 3.81% and most frequent subtype was 2a
(2.89%). Genotype 3 alone contributed to at least 78.96%
of all isolates and most frequent subtype was 3a (58.01%),
followed by 3b (9.76%). Genotype 4, 5 and 6 were rare
with the rate of 1.59%, 0.10% and 0.13, respectively. The
rates for mixed genotype, and untypeable genotypes were
5.03%, and 3.30%, respectively (Table 3, Figure 1 and 2
showed distribution of genotypes/subtypes in Pakistan).
HCV genotypes of mixed infection have been investigated
in only 118 (8.25%) individuals and mixed subtypes in 157
(10.98%) individuals. Mixed infection 1&3 was found with
the rate of 0.35%, 1&4 (0.003%), 3&6 (0.021%), 2&3
(0.017%), 3&5 (0.007%), 3&4 (0.003%), 1&5 (0.007%) and
2&4&6 (0.007%). The most frequent mixed subtype was
3a&3b (0.387%), followed by 1a&3a (0.06%), 1b&3a (0.05),
1a&3b (0.024%), 2b&3a (0.014%) and 2a&3a (0.010%).
This study showed that HCV infections in hepatitis
patients are attributed predominantly to viral genotype 3
in Pakistan with the rate of 68.94% in Punjab, 76.88% in
Sindh, 58% in KPK and 60.71% in Balochistan. In addition, there was a relatively high prevalence of genotype
1 (12.14%) in Punjab while untypeable infection represented the second more frequent genotype among the
studied population in Sindh (8.33%), KPK (20.16%) and
Balochistan (32.14%).

Statistically no difference was found in HCV genotypes in terms of age and sex of the patients, also confirmed by other studies [14,42,43] but in contrast to
reports from developed countries like USA and Southeast Asia, where lifestyles among young adults seem to
have influenced the molecular epidemiology of HCV
especially by their young drug addicts [42].
With reference to this countrywide information this
study suggested that HCV 3 was the leading genotype in
Pakistan. Other major types were genotype 1 and mixed
genotype. A high prevalence of variants of genotype 3
alone to be over 79.43% in Pakistan overall- alone or in
combination with another genotype (78.96% had genotype alone, and a further 157/157 had this genotype
mixed with another genotype). High prevalence of
HCV genotype 3 in Pakistan is a good hope for cure as
well as control of HCV infection [6,15]. Genotype 3
requires shorter duration of treatment as compared with

genotype 1, with its associated reduced cost and side
effects [33]. The predominance of HCV genotype 3 in
our population confirmed the predominance of HCV
genotype 3 in the surrounding countries including India
[2,15,16], Iran [44], Bangladesh [14,15] and China [2].
Each genotype has few subtypes in Pakistan, three for
Genotype 1, three for genotype 2, four for genotype 3,
two for genotype 4, one for genotype 5 and one for

genotype 6. This showed reduced diversity of subtypes
in Pakistan. It would therefore appear from different
studies conducted in different parts that substantial
regional differences do exist in our country. Genotype 1
is the second highest genotype in the country. Balochistan shares a long border with Iran in the west where
genotypes 1a and 3a are most prevalent [3,45]. High
prevalence of genotype 3a and 1b has been reported
from China [2]. It is quite possible that genotype 1 may
have entered into Pakistan from these countries through
local persons who cross borders for job and trade. Shifts
in HCV genotype distribution needs to be paid more
attention. This raises an alarming signal on the major
steps to be taken to reduce such infection as genotype
1a and 4a are associated with severe cirrhosis.
A proportion of patients will have their genotype
reported untypeable (3.306%). Presence of untypeable
samples in indicated that some novel genotypes are present in Pakistan. Our next goal should be to find out the
sequencing of these samples, which will be very useful in
prescribing the therapy for patients [1]. For being able to
identify untypeable genotypes, phylogenetic analysis of
extensive genome sequences is required and continuous
efforts are required toward a better characterization of this
variant. Most of the studies were not able to separate different kinds of patients among the untypeable genotype
group because of the retrospective nature of their studies.
Other studies were unable to sequence the untypeable
samples due to lack of sequencing facility.
