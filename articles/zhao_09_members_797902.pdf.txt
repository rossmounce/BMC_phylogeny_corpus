Abstract
Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenously expressed small RNAs with a length of
about 21 nt. MiRNAs silence their target genes at the post-transcriptional level. In plants, miRNAs
play various developmental and physiological roles by cleavaging mRNAs predominantly. Drought
and high salinity are the most severe environmental abiotic stresses and cause crop losses all over
the world.
Results: In this study, we identified miR-169g and miR-169n (o) as high salinity-responsive miRNAs
in rice. MiR-169n and miR169o were in a miRNA cluster with a distance of 3707 base pairs (bp).
The high degree of conservation and close phylogenic distance of pre-miR-169n and pre-miR-169o
indicated that they were derived from a very recent tandem duplication evolutionary event. The
existence of a cis-acting abscisic acid responsive element (ABRE) in the upstream region of miR169n (o) suggested that miR-169n (o) may be regulated by ABA. In our previous study, we found
that miR-169g was induced by the osmotic stress caused by drought via a dehydration-responsive
element (DRE). Thus, our data showed that there were both overlapping and distinct responses of
the miR-169 family to drought and salt stresses. We also showed that these miR-169 members
selectively cleaved one of the NF-YA genes, Os03g29760, which is a CCAAT-box binding
transcription factor and participates in transcriptional regulation of large number genes. Finally, we
found one or more ath-miR-169 member that was also induced by high salinity.
Conclusion: We identified members of the miR-169 family as salt-induced miRNAs and analyzed
their evolution, gene organization, expression, transcriptional regulation motif and target gene. Our
data also indicated that the salt-induction of some miR-169 members was a general property in
plants.

Background
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a newly identified class of small
single-stranded non-coding RNAs that range in length
from roughly 18 to 24 nucleotides (nt). Most miRNA

genes are thought to exist as independent transcriptional
units and are transcribed by RNA polymerase II into long
primary transcripts, termed pri-microRNAs [1-4]. Mature
miRNA formation is a multi-step process involving many

complicated enzymes [5-12]. MiRNAs regulate their target
genes via two main mechanisms: target mRNA cleavage
and translational repression. In plants, most miRNAs
have perfect or near perfect complementarity to their
mRNA targets and cleave them [1,13-16]. MiRNAs are
involved in plant development, signal transduction, protein degradation, response to environmental stress and
pathogen invasion, and they also regulate their own biogenesis [14,16-19]. In the past few years, more and more
miRNAs have been identified. However, their functions
remain mostly unknown.

MiR-169n and miR-169o were located in a miRNA gene
cluster and derived from a recent tandem duplication
event. There were DRE and ABRE cis-acting elements in
the upstream region of miR-169g and miR-169n-o,
respectively. We also showed that NF-YA transcription factor, Os03g29760, is a target gene of these salt-inducible
miR-169 members and were cleaved rapidly after high
salinity treatment. Finally, we found that one or more athmiR-169 member was also induced by high salinity. This
indicated that some members of miR-169 family might be
a general property in plants.

Abiotic stresses such as drought, soil salinity, extreme temperatures, chemical toxicity and oxidative stress are serious threats to agriculture and result in environmental
deterioration. For plants, drought and high salinity are the
main abiotic stresses and are becoming widespread
through the world. Many genes and biochemical molecules are involved in the responses to abiotic stress in
plants. However there is only a very limited view on miRNAs involved in abiotic stress [20-24]. Rice is a major
worldwide crop for food supply, but its yield is frequently
affected by abiotic stress. We had analyzed a miRNA profile under drought stress in rice (Oryza sativa) and identified two drought-induced miRNAs: miR-169g and miR393 [22]. MiR-169g was the only member of the miR-169
family induced by drought. Sequence analysis revealed
two proximate DREs (Dehydration-Responsive Element)
in the upstream region of the MIR-169g promoter, suggesting that miR-169g could be regulated directly by the
transcriptional factors CBF/DREBs, in response to abiotic
stress in plants. These results suggested that miR-169g
might play a role under drought stress in rice.

Results

The CCAAT box is one of the most common elements in
eukaryotic promoters. It is present in 30% of all eukaryotic genes and is located 80 to 100 base pairs (bp) upstream
of the transcription start site (TSS) [25,26]. The NF-Y complex (also known as CBF or HAP) was isolated as a
CCAAT-binding protein complex and is an evolutionarily
conserved transcription factor that occurs in a wide range
of organisms from yeast to humans. It includes three subunits: NF-YA (CBF-B or HAP2), NF-YB (CBF-A or HAP3),
and NF-YC (CBF-C or HAP5), all of which are required for
DNA binding [25,26]. In Arabidopsis, there are 10 genes
encoding for the NF-YA subunit, 10 genes for the NF-YB
subunit and 9 genes for the NF-YC subunit [27,28]. Further, 10 NF-YA genes, 11 NF-YB genes and 7 NF-YC genes
have been identified in rice [29]. All of these plant NF-Y
genes contain an evolutionarily conserved domain, which
is responsible for DNA binding and protein-protein interactions, and various non-conserved regions in both length
and amino acid sequence [25,26].
In this study, we found that not only miR-169g but also
miR-169n and miR-169o were induced by high salinity.

Response of the miR-169 family to high salinity in rice
In our previous study, we identified miR-169g and miR393 as drought-induced miRNAs in rice [22]. Studies have
indicated the existence of significant crosstalk between
drought and high-salt stress signaling pathways in plants.
Thus, we further tested the response of the miR-169 family to high-salt stress and wondered whether any members
of miR-169 family were induced by high salinity. The high
salinity environment was mimicked by 150 mM NaCl.
The rice seedlings were treated for 0, 0.5, 2, 6, 24 and 48
hours. MiR-169 is a large miRNA family containing 17
known members that represent nine different mature
sequences with a little different [22]. Seven probes that
had been designed to distinguish these different mature
sequences in our previous study were used to screen their
responses to high salinity [22]. Two probes (miR-169f, g
and miR-169n, o) detected the induced signals (Figure
1A). As in our previous study, the RT-PCR assay indicated
that miR-169g, but not miR-169f, was induced by high
salinity (Figure 1B). However, the RT-PCR assay failed to
distinguish miR-169n and miR-169o because of the high
level of conservation in their stem-loop region (see next
section). Other members of miR-169 family showed
either no induction by high salinity stress or no expression, in keep with our previous report (Figure 1A).
MIR-169n and MIR-169o genes were involved in gene
duplication evolution
By analyzing the genomic organization and sequence conservation of known miRNA families, several studies had
demonstrated that some miRNAs evolved through segmental and tandem duplications in the same manner as
protein-coding genes [30-32]. When we analyzed the gene
organization of MIR-169n and MIR-169o, we found the
two miRNA genes are clustered in a region of about 10
000 bp between two annotated genes: Os11g0216400
and Os11g0216300. The distance of the two mature miRNAs was 3707 bp (Figure 2A). Furthermore, there was a
high degree of conservation in their surrounding regions
(Figure 2B). The highest degree of conservation occurred
in their stem-loops and slightly less conservation still
existed in their downstream regions (Figure 2B). The
intact stem-loops of pri-miR-169n and pri-miR169o are

that this duplication must have been a recent event. To
verify our deduction, we plotted the phylogenic tree of the
miR-169 family stem-loops. As expected, the distance
between pre-miR-169n and pre-miR-169o was much
smaller than any other (Figure 2D). In addition, the
branch point of pre-miR-169n and pre-miR-169o
emerged much later than others (Figure 2D).
The cis-acting element analysis of the salt-induced
microRNAs
The promoters of drought- and salt-inducible genes contain two major classes of cis-acting elements, ABRE and
DRE, both of which are involved in stress-inducible gene
expression [33,34]. ABRE and DRE are the major cis-acting elements that function in ABA-dependent and ABAindependent gene expression respectively [33,35].

control. (B) RT-PCR analysis of the expression of pri-miR169f and pri-miR-169g. β-tubulin was used as the interior
control.

To analyze the cis-acting elements of the miR-169n-o cluster, we should first ascertain its potential transcript start
site (TSS) and promoter. As previously described, a
sequence of approximately 3000 base pairs between the
upstream annotated gene and the mature sequence of
miR-169n was scanned by TSSP [36]. Two potential promoters were predicted by TSSP, whose TSSs were approximately 130 bp and 1568 bp upstream of the miR-169n
(Figure 3A). To test which was the natural promoter, we
designed four pairs of primers to detect four different
regions around the two promoters (Figure 3A). The results
were shown in Figure 3B. Only region 1 (R1) could be
amplified successfully from the cDNA. These results indicated that the TSS 130 bp upstream of miR-169n was the
genuine one. Then, the 1000 bp upstream region of this
promoter was searched for cis-acting elements. There was
no DRE in the sequence upstream of the miR-169n-o cluster. However, there was an ABRE at 813 bp upstream of
the predicted TSS of the miR-169n-o cluster (Table 1). For
the miR-169 family, miR-169g was induced by drought
via the DRE, an ABA-independent element. However,
miR-169g and miR-169 (o) were induced by high salinity
through both DRE and ABRE, where ABRE is an ABAdependent element (Table 2). These data indicated that
the mechanism of the miR-169 response to drought and
salt was obviously different.

very large: more than 300 nt (Figure 2C). Due to the high
conservation of their sequences, their predicted secondary
structures are also highly similar (Figure 2C). According to
the previous studies [30-32], the high conservation in
such large and closed regions indicated that MIR-169n
and MIR-169o were the result of a tandem duplication
event. Prior to this duplication event, the salt-inducible
miRNA was the original microRNA (miR-169no). After
duplication, a copy (miR-169n or miR-169o) was generated, and the original and copy formed a miRNA cluster.
Moreover, the high level of conservation also suggested

Target genes of the salt-induced miR-169 genes
In Arabidopsis, some CCAAT-box binding transcription
factors have been reported as target genes of the ath-miR169 family [4,37]. To identify the target genes of Osa-miR169, we performed a target gene search by running miRU
against the TIGR Rice Genome mRNA database (OSA1
release 5, 01/23/2007) [38]. Consistent with the previous
report, several NF-YA genes, a large CCAAT-box binding
transcription factor family conserved in all eukaryotes,
were predicted to be target genes of miR-169 in rice (see
Additional File 1). All of the predicted target sites were
located not in the ORF, but in 3'-UTR. Some of them had

been recently named by Thirumurugan et al (see Additional File 1) [29]. In their recent genome-wide identification of the NF-Y family, 10 NF-YA genes, 11 NF-YB genes
and 7 NF-YC genes were identified in rice [29]. NF-YA is
one of the subunits of the NF-Y complex, which bind to
the CCAAT-box promoter to regulate the expression of
numerous genes. To investigate whether these NY-YA
genes were in fact regulated by miR-169, we further quantified the mRNA levels of some predicted genes after high
salinity treatment. The primers spanning the target site
were designed for RT-PCR. Two amplicons from
Os03g29760 and Os07g41720 respectively showed rapid
down-regulation after high salinity treatment. The downregulation of Os03g29760 was more significant and rapid
than that of Os07g41720. However, the mRNAs seemed
to quickly escape from cleavage and turned to normal
level 24 hours after treatment despite the fact that the
miRNAs were still induced. Other NF-YA genes had no
obvious changes on mRNA levels (Figure 4A). Real-time
PCR assay showed similar results (Figure 4B). To further
confirm this point, the total RNAs from samples at 0.5
hours, 2 hours and 6 hours were pooled and used for
mapping the cleavage site by 5'-RACE assay. As shown in
Figure 4C, two expected bands from Os03g29760 were
observed by using two Os03g29760 specific primers. The

prior sequencing showed that the two bands were the
mixtures representing the right cleavage site and some
degradation products with the 5' end downstream of the
miRNA cleavage site. Those clones with the longest insertions were further sequenced and the results were summarized in figure 4D. However, we failed to amplify any
bands from Os07g41720. In all, our data confirmed that
Os03g29760 (NF-YA-8 or OsHAP2E), an NF-YA gene, was
transiently cleaved by miR-169 after salt treatment in rice.
The response of the miR-169 family to high salinity in
Arabidopsis
To determine whether the response of the miR-169 family
to high salinity also occurs in other plants, we treated Arabidopsis seedling with high salinity. Treatment persisted
for 24 hours and 48 hours, as described in the methods
section. Because the sequences of the ath-miR-169 family
are very similar, only one probe was used for northern
blot. Thus, the detected signal was the sum signal from all
the miR-169 members. As in rice, the probe to the athmiR-169 family detected a similar induced signal (Figure
5). This indicated that at least one member of the athmiR-169 family was induced significantly by high salinity.
However, a slight difference between rice and Arabidopsis
was observed. In rice, the significant induction was
observed immediately after 24 hours of treatment, while
in Arabidopsis, induction was observed until after 48 hours
of treatment (Figure 5). This may be attributed to the biological differences among plant species. Of course, the
conditions of the plants' culture and treatment could also
be one of the causes. These results suggested that the
induction of some miR-169 members by abiotic stress was
a common phenomenon in plants.

Drought and salinity are becoming particularly widespread in many regions and are the primary cause of crop
loss worldwide. Many genes that are induced by these
stresses have been identified [39,40]. However, little is
known about the relation between the miRNA and these
stresses [20-22,24,41]. Our studies have shown that some
miR-169 members were induced by these stresses in rice
and Arabidopsis. Interestingly, it seemed that only a minority of members of the large miR-169 family responded to
these stresses. Furthermore, these inducible microRNAs
displayed specificity to different stresses.

rRNA stained by ethidium bromide was used as the loading
control.

Plant microRNA families are usually much larger than
those of animals. MiR-169 is one of the largest families of
miRNAs in plants. To date, the rice miR-169 family contains 17 members in the MicroRNA Registry 10.0 [42,43].
These members have very similar or the same mature
sequences and almost the same predicted target genes.
However, their expression profiles were very different
(Figure 1A). Noticeably, miR-169g and miR-169n (o)
exhibited identical responses to high salinity, but different
responses to drought. From our studies, we speculated
that miR-169 could be a miRNA family that responds to
various stress conditions. In our study, the stress condition was more moderate than those of some other groups
[21,44,45]. For this reason, we thus could not exclude that
other members of miR-169 could be induced by more
intense salt stress condition.

as its target genes. Our subsequent data validated that two
of the predicted target genes were down-regulated as the
members of the miR-169 were induced by high salinity.
NF-YA is one of the subunits of NF-Y complex, which was
isolated as a CCAAT-box binding complex and is an evolutionarily conserved transcription factor [25,26]. The
CCAAT box is one of the most common elements in
eukaryotic promoters and is present in 30% of all eukaryotic genes. A study in Triticum aestivum revealed that nine
subunits of the NF-Y complex were responsive to drought
[46]. TaNF-YA1 mRNA levels showed a significant reduction in drought-affected leaves to around one-third of that
seen in leaves of the non-stressed control. A similar level
of down-regulation in the drought-stressed leaves was
seen for four TaNF-YB genes (TaNF-YB3, 6, 7 and 8) and
three TaNF-YC genes (TaNF-YC5, 11 and 12). Only TaNFYB2 was up-regulated under drought condition [46]. That
so many NF-Y subunits were down-regulated by drought
indicated the expression of many genes controlled by NFY complexes were turned off as a result and also that NFY complexes should play quite important and comprehensive roles in plant adaptation to drought.
The mRNA levels of Os03g29760 and Os07g41720
declined immediately after high salinity treatment,
according to the induction of miR-169 in rice. However,
rapid compensation was observed at 24 hours after treatment despite the fact that the miRNAs were still being
induced. Our data partially explained the mRNAs reduction of some NF-Y subunits as observed by Stephenson et
al [46]. The transient inhibition suggested some mechanisms help the NY-YA gene to escape from cleavage by
miR-169 after long-time treatment of high salinity. Given
that the NF-Y complex potentially regulates so many
genes, we speculated that the roles of miR-169g, miR169n and miR-169o under salt-stress in rice could be
involved in comprehensive physiological processes.
Therefore, we thought that these miRNAs are one of the
crucial molecules at an upstream node in transcriptional
regulatory networks of salt stress signal transduction. In
recent years, although both large numbers of up-regulated
and down-regulated genes were identified [44,45,47-49],
most intention has been focused on genes that were
induced in plant under abiotic stresses such as drought
and high salinity. The down-regulation of many genes
should be also very important for plants to tolerate the
environmental stresses, while little is known about that
how and why these genes are down-regulated. Our data
suggested that the salt-inducible members of the miR-169
family could be pivotal molecules in inhibiting these
down-regulated genes under Abiotic stresses.

At least five signal transduction pathways exist in drought
and high salinity stress responses: three are ABA dependent and two are ABA independent [33,34]. In the ABAdependent pathways, ABRE functions as a major ABAresponsive element. DRE is a major responsive element in
the ABA-independent pathway. In this study, high salinity
induced both miR-169g and miR-169n (o) which contain
DRE and ABRE respectively. In our previous study [22],
only drought had induced miR-169g, which contains
DREs. PEG treatment only mimics osmotic stress, while
salt treatment also brings ionic toxicity except for osmotic
stress to plants. From this point, we concluded that miR169g could have been induced by osmotic stress, while
miR-169n and miR-169o were induced by ionic stress.
The difference of the cis-acting regulative elements on
MIR-169g and MIR-169n (o) could be part of the molecular base of their diverse responses to stresses.

Conclusion

In addition, we searched the target genes of the miR169
family in silica, and genes of NF-YA family were predicted

In this study, we identified that miR-169g and miR169n(o) were induced by high salinity. We analyzed the
gene organization and conservation of the miR-169n and

miR-169o. The high level of conservation suggested that
these two miRNAs derived from a tandem duplication
event. The promoter searching revealed that there were
ABRE elements in the sequence upstream of the miR169n-o cluster and suggested that miR-169n, o may be
regulated by ABA-dependent pathway. We further identified Os03g29760 (NF-YA-8 or OsHAP2E) as a target gene
of miR-169 by 5'-RACE. In Arabidopsis, at least one member of the ath-miR-169 family was induced significantly
by high salinity.

Methods
Plant treatments and RNA isolation
The seeds (Oryza sativa, var. japonica) were stimulated to
break dormancy, germinated and then transferred to
Yoshida's culture solution under a 13-hour light (26°C)/
11-hour dark (22°C) photoperiod. After 12 days in culture, the seedlings were used for experiments. For salt
treatment, the seedlings were transferred into fresh culture
solution containing 150 mM NaCl. Seedlings were harvested at 0, 0.5, 2, 6, 24 and 48 hours after treatment.

Arabidopsis seeds were sterilized and sown on an MS plate
containing 0.4% phytage gel and stratified at 4°C for three
days, then transferred to 22°C under continuous light for
germination and growth. Seven days after germination,
the seedings were transferred to a 96-well plate without
bottom and grew on MS liquid medium. After 14 days, the
MS medium was replaced by MS containing 150 mM
NaCl for stress treatment. Seedings were harvested at 0, 24
and 48 hours after treatment.
Samples were then ground to a fine powder and the total
RNAs were extracted using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen).
RNA gel blot analysis
For mature miRNA analysis, total RNA (10 μg) was loaded
per lane and resolved on a denaturing 12% polyacrylamide
gel. The gel was separated into two parts. One part containing 5S rRNA was stained by ethidium bromide, and the
other containing miRNAs was transferred to a Hybond N+
nylon membrane (Amersham). The membranes were
cross-linked with UV at 125 mJ/cm2. DNA probes complementary to miRNA sequences were end-labeled with [γ-32P]
ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) (Amersham) by T4 polynucleotide
kinase (MBI). Unincorporated [γ-32P] ATP was removed
using a sephadex G-25 column. Prehybridization and
hybridization were carried out using PerfectHyb Hybridization Solution (TOYOBO) at 37°C. Blots were washed in 2
× SSC/0.1% SDS according to the user manual. The membrane was measured with a PhosphorImager and scanned
with GE Storm 860 (Amersham) or FUJIFILM FLA-9000.
All probes used were described as previous and listed in
Additional File 2. The probe (os-miR-169a, b, c, e) were
also used to detect ath-miR-169.

RT-PCR and quantitative real-time PCR assay
2 μg total RNA and 0.5 μg random hexamers were heated
to 70°C for five minutes and then cooled on ice. The
remaining reagents (5 × reaction buffer, dNTPs, RNase
inhibitor and M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega))
were then added and incubated at 37°C for one hour. The
RT product was used as a template for PCR using Ex-Taq
Hotstart (Takara). The primers used were listed in Additional File 2. To quantify the predicted target genes, these
primers were also used for a quantitative real-time PCR
assay with SYBR GREEN PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems).
5'-RACE assay
The total RNA from samples at 0.5, 2 and 6 hours were
pooled and used for a 5'-RACE assay. Briefly, total RNA
was ligated to a synthesized RNA adaptor (T4 RNA ligase,
Fermentas) and then transcribed by gene-specific primers
(Superscript II, Invitrogen). The adaptor primer (i.e. the
DNA version of the RNA adaptor) and gene-specific primers were used to amplify the ligation product (Ex-Taq Hotstart, Takara). The amplicons were cloned to pMD19-T
Vector (Takara). Clones with the expected insertions were
sequenced. The sequences of adaptor and primers were
listed in Additional File 2.
Sequence alignment, RNA folding and phylogenic analysis
of Osa-miR-169 family
The surrounding sequences of miR-169n and miR-169o
were extracted and aligned by ClustalX using the default
parameter. The conserved sequences (sequences in blue
parentheses in Figure 2B) were folded by RNAstructure
software. The distances of stem-loops of the Osa-miR-169
family stem-loops were calculated with ClustalX and the
phylogenic tree was visualized by njplotWin95.
