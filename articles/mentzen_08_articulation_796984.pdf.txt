Abstract
Background: Elucidating metabolic network structures and functions in multicellular organisms is
an emerging goal of functional genomics. We describe the co-expression network of three core
metabolic processes in the genetic model plant Arabidopsis thaliana: fatty acid biosynthesis, starch
metabolism and amino acid (leucine) catabolism.
Results: These co-expression networks form modules populated by genes coding for enzymes
that represent the reactions generally considered to define each pathway. However, the modules
also incorporate a wider set of genes that encode transporters, cofactor biosynthetic enzymes,
precursor-producing enzymes, and regulatory molecules. We tested experimentally the hypothesis
that one of the genes tightly co-expressed with starch metabolism module, a putative kinase
AtPERK10, will have a role in this process. Indeed, knockout lines of AtPERK10 have an altered
starch accumulation. In addition, the co-expression data define a novel hierarchical transcript-level
structure associated with catabolism, in which genes performing smaller, more specific tasks appear
to be recruited into higher-order modules with a broader catabolic function.
Conclusion: Each of these core metabolic pathways is structured as a module of co-expressed
transcripts that co-accumulate over a wide range of environmental and genetic perturbations and
developmental stages, and represent an expanded set of macromolecules associated with the
common task of supporting the functionality of each metabolic pathway. As experimentally
demonstrated, co-expression analysis can provide a rich approach towards understanding gene
function.

Background
Biological systems are characterized by their capacity to
achieve net metabolic inter-conversions while maintaining homeostasis in the face of environmental and developmental cues. This capacity is hard-wired into the

genetic blueprint of an organism, and is manifested by the
controlled expression of the genetic potential of the
organism's genome as it responds to divergent signals and
prompts. Mechanisms that control the expression of an
organism's genetic potential include those that regulate

gene transcription, RNA processing, stability and translation, and processing of polypeptides and their assembly
into complexes. Some of these complexes are enzyme catalysts, whereas others are structural or regulatory. A metabolic network in its broadest sense can be defined as
encompassing the collection of catalytic, structural and
regulatory genes, which are expressed as mRNAs, proteins
and metabolites that work in coordination to achieve net
metabolic conversions.
Advances made over the last decade in the area of functional genomics have provided an increasing ability to
globally profile genome expression at the level of RNAs,
proteins and metabolites. These data define the transcriptome, proteome and metabolome, respectively. It is conceptually possible to identify metabolic networks from
experimental data that reveal correlations in abundance of
sub-group of molecules (mRNAs, proteins/protein complexes, or metabolites). Given that the behavior of an
organism can be regulated by multiple mechanisms that
impact the transcriptome, proteome and metabolome, it
is significant to ask the extent to which the transcriptome
can reveal metabolic networks. In the unicellular eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which offers the advantage of
cell populations that are homogenous and a relatively
simple genome with only 6,608 genes (SGD project "Saccharomyces Genome Database", January 13, 2008 [1]),
the operation of metabolic networks, including glycolysis
and purine metabolism, has been revealed from transcriptome datasets alone [2-4]. But can such metabolic networks be detected in organisms with a larger, more
complex genome, or in multicellular organisms, where
evidence for metabolic networks can be swamped by
noise associated with cellular differentiation?
The pathway-guided approach to examine the correspondence between the known metabolic pathway and
the organization of metabolic processes learned from
expression data is to select sets of genes for pathways and
search for significant co-expression within each pathway.
This method has been used to reveal transcriptional coexpression of genes belonging to the same metabolic
pathway across different tissues in complex organisms,
e.g., Krebs cycle enzymes in frog [5] or lactose biosynthesis enzymes in mouse [6]. Another, module-guided,
approach is to classify a set of genes according to their
expression patterns, and study the correspondence of
these clusters with identifiable biological processes. This
approach was used to reveal 44 modules that correspond
to several metabolic pathways in C. elegans, including
lipid and amino acid biosynthesis [7].
In recent years, wealth of expression data emerged and
several online repositories for microarray data have been
created, including NASCArrays [8], Genevestigator [9],

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/76

PLEXdb [10], MetaOmGraph [11], ArrayExpress [12],
Vanted [13], Virtual Plant [14], ATTED-II [15], Arabidopsis Coexpression Data Mining Tool [16], MapMan [17],
and PageMan [18]. The availability of the data querying
the transcriptome across the diverse conditions allows for
the creation of the compendium of the biological
responses to many perturbations, that may guide the
interpretation of the microarray experiments and the
annotation of the new genes [19-22]. Because it has
become technically possible to profile the entire transcriptome of an organism (it is still a technical challenge to
determine the proteome and metabolome), we tested the
feasibility of using only transcriptomics data to reveal the
operation of metabolic networks in Arabidopsis. A study
by Gachon et al. has shown that genes for enzymes of
indole, phenylpropanoid and flavonoid biosynthesis in
Arabidopsis are co-expressed [23]. Similar co-expression
has been shown for enzymes for synthesis of cellulose and
other cell wall components [24-26] and in isoprenoid
biosynthesis pathways [27]. An analysis of the transcription coordination of 1,330 Arabidopsis genes implicated
in metabolic pathways in AraCyc revealed that the coexpression among genes from the same pathway is higher,
than among genes from different pathways [28]. Several
metabolic processes could be also identified as coherent
subnetworks in the recent analysis of Arabidopsis gene
network, based on the compendium of the expression
profiles [29].
Here, we focus on three core metabolic pathways of Arabidopsis: fatty acid biosynthesis, starch metabolism and
leucine catabolism, and analyze their expression in the
context of the 22,746 genes represented on the Affymetrix
ATH1 chip. Our approach unites the pathway-guided and
module-guided methods in that we group the pre-selected
set of known and putative genes from pathways into modules, and subsequently assign the function to those putative candidates that are within the module. We exploit the
assumption that a node in a network can be hypothesized
to have a similar attribute (e.g., function, or location, if
nodes represent genes) as the majority of the nodes in its
neighborhood of some radius. This assumption has
recently gained popularity as the way of assigning function to otherwise unknown genes [28,30,31]. The coexpression network created from among the genes from
these pathways forms modules that include enzymes for
reactions within each pathway, suggest extensions of catalytic steps in the pathway, and also allow for identification
of transporters, cofactors and regulatory molecules associated with the module. Indeed, one of the genes identified
in the starch module had been shown independently [32]
to be involved in regulation of starch metabolism. We
used knock out mutants to experimentally evaluate a second putative regulatory gene in the starch module.

Results and discussion
Fatty Acid Biosynthesis, Starch Metabolism and Leucine
Catabolism form Comprehensive Modules
In order to determine how co-expression networks extend
across metabolic processes, we selected three core metabolic pathways for analysis: fatty acid biosynthesis, starch
metabolism, and mitochondrial leucine catabolism (Fig.
1). These pathways were selected in part because of the
authors' extensive knowledge of their structure and biological implications (e.g., [33-39]). Fatty acid biosynthesis
is the process by which acetyl-CoA is used to generate acyl
moieties that are used as components of cellular membranes, signaling molecules, and molecules that store
energy (e.g., seed oils) [40]. Starch is the principal polymeric storage form of glucose, and is stored either transiently in leaves or long-term in seeds [41]. Leucine
catabolism provides an alternate source of acetyl-CoA to
sustain respiration and metabolic processes in the absence
of photosynthesis [42]. We assembled a list of genes with
a demonstrated or putative function in these three metabolic pathways; these genes encode not only the enzymes
of the "textbook pathway", but also enzymes important
for synthesis of cofactors and transporters that are thought
to be involved in these processes. Specifically, a set of 126
genes associated with these pathways was identified based
upon one of three criteria: 1) genes that were demonstrated by experimental evidence to belong to one of these
pathways; 2) genes assigned "putative" functionality in
one of these pathways, based on sequence similarity and
subcellular localization; or 3) genes encoding transporters
and enzymes synthesizing co-factors required for these
pathways [see Additional file 1].

Publicly available Affymetrix ATH1 chip-transcriptomic
datasets comprising of 956 biological samples were used
to infer patterns of transcript co-accumulation for the
22,746 Arabidopsis genes that are represented on this
chip (see Methods section for details). These data are
drawn from 72 experiments from NASCArrays [43] and
PLEXdb [44] that represent a wide range of developmental, and environmental and genetic perturbations on Arabidopsis [see Additional file 2]. Data with poor
reproducibility were discarded, and the data was normalized to the same mean and range (available at MetaOmGraph [11]). We calculated the values of Pearson pairwise correlation across these data for the set of 126
selected genes. The results were visualized as a graph, such
that genes form the nodes, which are joined by an edge if
the value of correlation between them is higher than
selected threshold. Using Pearson correlation thresholds
of 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7 yields three co-expression networks of
107, 77 and 62 genes, connected by 733, 444, and 204
edges, respectively (Fig. 2). The positioning of the nodes
(genes) in these networks was produced by graph-layout
software that places highly interconnected nodes close

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/76

together [45]. Thus, the absolute position of the node on
the plot has no meaning, only its relative position versus
other nodes: the most closely crowded nodes indicate
genes with the highest co-expression. Within each of these
co-expression networks the number of correlations
between genes from the same metabolic pathway is significantly larger than in randomly generated networks with
similar link structure (specifically, in the network at
threshold 0.6, the proportion of within-pathway edges is
245/444, versus a mean of 112/444 in randomly rewired
networks; this is equal to a difference of ~20 standard
deviations; Fig. 3). As the correlation threshold is
increased from 0.5 to 0.7, three distinct closely-interconnected clusters emerge, whose member genes closely correspond with the three metabolic pathways that were the
focus of this study. We refer to the three closely-interconnected clusters identifiable in Fig. 2B as modules.
Starch is a complex molecule, whose metabolism comprises a network with many genes of known catalytic function but unclear physiological function [46,47]. Indeed,
several genes may function both in the catabolism and
biosynthesis of starch (e.g., pullulanase [48]). At the 0.6
correlation level, the starch metabolism module contains
28 genes encoding all the known enzymes of starch
metabolism. The module incorporates genes encoding
proteins, for which, to date, there is no experimental evidence of involvement in starch metabolism, for example
beta-amylase At2g32290 (BAM2), and three phosphoglucomutase-like
proteins
(At4g11570,
PGM-like2;
At1g70730, PGM-like3 and At1g70820, PGM-like4). On
the other hand, alpha-glucosidase, an enzyme which historically had been considered to be involved in starch degradation, although recent experimental data from potato
indicate otherwise [49], is not correlated with the Arabidopsis starch metabolic module (Fig. 2B). Although the
processes of starch synthesis and degradation are temporarily separated over diurnal cycles in Arabidopsis leaves
(reviewed in [50]; [51]), as is the transcription of many of
the starch metabolic genes ([52,53]; Foster and Wurtele,
unpublished data), this is not reflected in the co-expression network of Arabidopsis; rather the two processes
cluster together in a single module. Two factors in particular may contribute to starch synthesis and degradation
transcripts being in a common module. First, Arabidopsis
doesn't have a major starch-storage organ such as a tuber,
thus an organ of Arabidopsis that is highly capable of
starch synthesis may also be capable of a rapid shift to
starch degradation, and the overall levels of all the relevant transcripts may be high. Indeed, this is the case for
the diurnal fluctuations of the transcripts. Second, as several of the starch metabolic enzymes appear to function in
both starch degradation and synthesis [48] (indeed the
full extent to which this is true is not yet known), expres-

sion of such genes may be associated with both starch degradation and starch synthesis.
The fatty acid synthesis module contains genes encoding
the complete set of enzymes required for the biosynthesis
of 18-carbon fatty acids from acetyl-CoA: three nuclearencoded subunits of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (CAC2,
CAC3, BCCP1, BCCP2, and BCCP1-like), malonylCoA:ACP transacylase (MAT), acyl carrier protein (ACP1,
ACP2&3 and ACP5), beta-ketoacyl-[ACP] synthases (KAS
I, KAS II and KAS III), beta-ketoacyl-[ACP] reductase
(KAR), beta-hydroxyacyl-[ACP] dehydratase (HD and
HD-like), enoyl-ACP reductase (MOD1), stearoyl-[ACP]
desaturase (FAB2 and FAB2-like2) and acyl-[ACP]
thioesterases (FATA and FATA-like) (Fig. 4A). This module also contains all genes for the four subunits of plastidic pyruvate dehydrogenase, which produces acetyl-CoA
(the precursor for fatty acid biosynthesis) from pyruvate.
The apparent co-expression of the pyruvate dehydrogenase genes with fatty acid biosynthesis may indicate the
direction of the major metabolic flux of acetyl-CoA, even
though there are other fates of plastidic acetyl-CoA (e.g.,
biosynthesis of glucosinolates and amino acids, such as

leucine and cysteine). Interestingly, the module contains
genes for the final reaction in biotin biosynthesis [54-56]
and for lipoic acid biosynthesis, obligate cofactors of
acetyl-CoA carboxylase and pyruvate dehydrogenase,
respectively. In contrast, the acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACS)
genes do not show any expression correlation, consistent
with experimental evidence that this enzyme is not
required to provide acetyl-CoA for fatty acid biosynthesis
[33,57,58].
The leucine degradation module contains genes for the
four known enzymes of mitochondrial leucine catabolism
(Fig. 5): branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase
(BCAT), three out of four subunits of branched-chain
alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCDH), isovaleryl-CoA
dehydrogenase (IVD) and methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (MCC). Only a single BCAT is included in the module
(BCAT2, At1g10070). This gene is not the one postulated
by Schuster and Binder [59] to participate in leucine degradation. Consistent with these results, seven out of the
eight genes in our module (except IVD) form a coherent
subnetwork in the Arabidopsis gene network based on
partial correlation [29].

pathway is significantly larger than in randomly generated networks with similar link structure. Isolated nodes not shown.

Modules are Identifiable in the Space of All Gene
Transcripts
To test whether these pathway-specific modules can be
detected in the context of the expression of the entire
genome, and to determine whether genes other than those
encoding catalytic functions of the pathway are co-regulated, we calculated Pearson correlations between individual pathway-specific hub genes and the 22,746 genes
represented on the Affymetrix chip. The genes used as
hubs for each metabolic pathway are: At2g05990, encoding the enoyl-ACP reductase that is uniquely required in
de novo fatty acid biosynthesis [60]; At2g40840, starch
metabolism hub gene coding for disproportionating
enzyme [61]; and the leucine catabolism hub gene,
At4g34030, which encodes the Î² subunit of methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase [39,42] (Table 1).

Despite the complexities associated with a genome of
about 32,000 genes (TAIR7 Genome Release, April 23,
2007 [62]), and the challenge associated with the fact that
the RNAs used for the microarray analyses came from
plant samples that mix metabolically distinct cellular and
tissue compartments, it was still possible to find expression correlations among genes of common metabolic
pathways. Specifically, the majority of the genes that show
the highest correlation with the fatty acid biosynthesis
hub gene, the starch metabolism hub-gene, and the leucine catabolism hub-gene are the structural genes that
code for the enzymes required in each of these metabolic
pathways (Table 1). Similarly, for every gene in the mod-

ule, we found genes correlated with it (above the set
threshold) among 22,746 genes on ATH1 array and
checked how many of those correlated genes are also in
the same module ("in" links) and how many are not in
module ("out" links). We found that at 0.7 threshold, for
19 genes out of 22 in the fatty acid biosynthesis module,
the number of "in" links is higher than the number of
"out" links, and the same is true for 7 out of 8 leucine
catabolism genes, and 9 out of 16 starch metabolism
genes at the threshold of 0.8. Thus, these genes are preferentially interconnected among themselves with fewer
connections to other genes, which defines them as a module in the context of the Arabidopsis genome.
Analysis of co-expression also provides means of querying
the consequence of genome duplications. As with other
plant genomes, Arabidopsis has undergone wholegenome duplications (polyploidization), followed by
radical gene silencing, gene turnover, and expansion of
gene families, the most recent of which is thought to have
occurred about 25 million years ago [63,64]. In our analysis, At5g52920, one of the fourteen Arabidopsis genes
that code for pyruvate kinase, is highly correlated with the
fatty acid biosynthesis hub-gene (Table 1). Pyruvate
kinase catalyzes the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate
to pyruvate, the immediate precursor of the acetyl-CoA
used for fatty acid biosynthesis [65]. These data, therefore,
help to constrain the complexity associated with the polyploidization, and indicate that of the fourteen pyruvate
kinase genes that occur in the genome, At5g52920 is most

of as "fatty acid synthesis" (acetyl-CoA to fatty acids)
could be expanded to begin with phosphoenolopyruvate
(PEP), the substrate for pyruvate kinase (Fig. 4A).
Potential Regulatory Genes Identified as Coexpressing
with Metabolic Pathways
A set of potential regulatory genes whose expression patterns highly correlate with each of the pathway-specific
hub-gene was identified in this analysis (genes marked
with an asterisk, Table 1). Although these correlations
cannot be extrapolated to imply a causative role, identification of candidate regulatory genes delineates hypotheses and suggests experimental approaches for identifying
the regulatory function of these genes.

One such putative regulatory gene encodes a protein tyrosine phosphatase/kinase gene SEX4 (At3g52180) (Table 1
and Fig. 6A). Its presence in this module would lead us to
hypothesize an involvement in regulation of starch
metabolism. Indeed, this gene was recently shown experimentally to have a regulatory role in starch metabolism;
knockout alleles of At3g52180 have a starch excess phenotype [32]. Similarly, a gene encoding a putative protein
kinase (At1g26150, AtPERK10 [66]) is correlated with
genes in the starch metabolism module. We directly
checked whether this gene might play a role in regulation
of starch synthesis.
We obtained three independent alleles, named Atperk101, Atperk10-2, and Atperk10-3, corresponding to T-DNA
insertions at gene AtPERK10 locus. Homozygous mutant
lines stained for starch using Lugol solution showed an
increase in starch accumulation (data not shown). Figure

In addition, the co-expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase
and pyruvate kinase with the fatty acid biosynthesis genes
implies that the functional pathway commonly thought

Interestingly, the starch hub-gene shows a high negative
correlation with two Rab-like, GTPase-coding genes
(At5g47200; RAB1A and At4g17530; RAB1C; Fig. 6B). In
eukaryotes, proteins from this family of small GTP-ases
are regulatory and act as signaling molecules in diverse
processes [67]. The Arabidopsis protein that is phylogenetically the closest homolog to Rab-like GTPase is RAB1B
(At1g02130), which is localized to the ER, and as in mammalian systems, it is important for Golgi apparatus development [68]. RAB1A and RAB1C are predicted to be
secretory and might have function similar to that of
RAB1B, or some novel plant-specific regulatory function,
which appears to be negatively correlated with starch
metabolism.
The fatty acid synthesis module contains a pentatricopeptide repeat-containing protein (encoded by At5g50390).
Because such proteins are thought to participate in modulating the stability of organelle transcripts [69], this corre-

Genes used as the hub (at the top of the table) are methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (MCCB), active in leucine degradation in mitochondria;
disproportionating enzyme (DE2), from starch metabolism; and enoyl reductase (MOD1), an enzyme from plastidic fatty acid biosynthesis pathway.
Genes that code for proteins predicted to be in the same pathway as the hub gene are in bold font. Potential regulatory genes are marked with an
asterisk. Pearson coefficients (> 0.7) were calculated by MetaOmGraph. P-values for enrichment of genes from same pathway as hub are 4.35e-36,
2.02e-15, and 3.1e-23, respectively.
$ This gene product, although annotated as chalcone isomerase-like, appears to have a direct role in binding and possibly transporting fatty acids
(Joe Noel and Florence Pojer, personal communication).

lation may indicate a role for this gene in coordinating
nuclear-plastidic interactions for regulating fatty acid biosynthesis, via, for example, the control of the plastidencoded subunit gene of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (accD,
AtCg00500). This is the plastid-encoded biochemical
function that is most directly involved in fatty acid biosynthesis.
The leucine catabolism module contains a putative transcriptional regulator, At5g49450, which may code for a
bZIP family transcription factor.
Hierarchical Modularity of Catabolism
These transcriptome level analyses provide insights into
the hierarchical modularity of Arabidopsis metabolism.
Hierarchical organization can be considered the nesting of
one, tightly connected module within a larger one, still
distinct and separable from the surrounding network.
Hierarchical organization is particularly evident with leucine catabolism, which forms a functionally coherent and
tightly connected module, nested within a supermodule
[see Fig. 8 and Additional file 3].

Hierarchical organization of modules has been observed
for metabolic and transcriptional networks of E. coli [7072] and metabolic networks of 42 other organisms
[73,74]. Hierarchical modular organization has been postulated as the topology explaining the observed features of
biological networks, like scale-free character, high clustering coefficient and short path lengths [74,75]. Such architecture may enable better adaptation of the metabolic
fluxes to the changing conditions [74].
For Arabidopsis, the incorporation of leucine catabolism
into an overarching catabolic module is observed both on
the topological and functional level. From the topological
point of view, genes participating in the leucine catabolism form a fully connected subnetwork, while they also
exhibit weaker connection to the common larger set of
genes. Thus, a smaller, more strongly connected module is
nested within the bigger and less interconnected one.
From the functional point of view, one function (leucine
catabolism) forms a separable part of the larger, more
encompassing biological process. The supermodule contains genes that appear to have a broader but common
biological task of maintaining cellular energy balance via

catabolism. Specifically, the 26 genes most highly correlated with the eight genes in the leucine catabolic module
(defined in Fig. 2B) include genes that might be involved
in protein turnover (At1g76410), amino acid catabolism
(At1g06570, At1g08630, At2g14170, At3g47340,
At5g63620, in addition to eight genes from leucine catabolism pathway), carbohydrate catabolism (At1g18270,
At5g20250, At5g49360), lipid breakdown (At3g51840,
At5g41080) and cell wall degradation (At4g30270). Five

genes are annotated as associated with aging, senescence,
or response to light or sucrose stimuli (At2g43400,
At3g47340, At4g30270, At4g35770, At5g20250). Because
plants are photoautotrophs, such catabolic processes may
be expected to become critical when photosynthesis cannot maintain cellular energy balance, for example during
senescence, seed germination, carbon deprivation or
autophagy [37,39,42,76]. Consistent with this concept,
we find that the genes within this supermodule are coinduced to highest levels of expression under experimental conditions that are expected to limit photosynthetic
carbon fixation and induce catabolic processes for maintaining energy balance (e.g., oxidative, cold, heat and
drought stress â experiments from NASCArrays: NASCARRAYS-28, NASCARRAYS-79, NASCARRAYS-70; disruption
of
plastome-nucleome
communication,
NASCARRAYS-89; mutations and illumination conditions that affect the phytochrome response, NASCARRAYS-89,
NASCARRAYS-124;
sucrose
starvation,
Contento et al. [76] and NASCARRAYS-14; and hexose
signaling, NASCARRAYS-40 [8]).
This catabolic supermodule also contains genes with welldefined or partially defined molecular functions, but
undefined physiological functionality (e.g. At1g76410,
zinc finger protein; At5g21170, protein kinase;
At5g16340, AMP-binding protein). The inclusion of these
genes within this catabolic supermodule may indicate
their broader physiological function in catabolic processes; a hypothesis that can be experimentally tested by
new genetic and biochemical analyses.

Conclusion
This study reveals that transcriptomics data can divulge
hitherto unsuspected aspects of metabolic networks in a
complex eukaryotic organism. Each of these core metabolic pathways that were targeted for analysis is structured
as a co-expressed module whose transcripts co-accumulate over a wide range of environmental and genetic perturbations and developmental stages. These analyses
further indicate that modules can be recruited into hierarchical organization (supermodules), hinting at the possibility that supermodules are regulated by common signals
that coordinate net metabolic changes within highly interactive networks. The fact that such hierarchical organization is detected from the transcriptome data implies that
at least a subset of the higher-order metabolic network
may be regulated at the transcript level.

Methods
Transcriptomic Data
The experimental and meta-data was obtained from
online microarray depositories: NASCArrays [43] and
PLEXdb [44]. The data obtained from NASCArrays, from
72 experiments comprising of 956 Affymetrix ATH1

Page 11 of 15

BMC Plant Biology 2008, 8:76

microarray slides, had already been normalized with the
Affymetrix MAS 5.0 algorithm to the common mean value
of 100. We scaled the data from PLEXdb to set the mean
to 100.
The reproducibility of experiments was qualitatively
assessed on scatter plots by visual inspection and chips
with poor biological replicates were discarded. The
remaining biological replicates were averaged to yield 424
samples. Determination of biological replicates (replicates of the same treatment within the experiments) was
done manually, based on the slide name and experiment
information. Most slides have descriptive names that
summarize treatment and the replicate status. Thus, slides
that are biological replicates of the same treatment have
the same slide name, differing only in "Repx" suffix, e.g.,
Shirras_1â3_Non-Calcicole_Rep1
Shirras_1â4_Non-Calcicole_Rep2
The data was subsequently normalized to the same range
by a median absolute deviation (MAD)-based scale normalization method described by Yang et al., [77]. Expression values xij on microarray chip j were multiplied by the
C
factor MAD , where MAD is defined by
j

MADj = mediani{|xij-mediani(xij)|}
and the constant C is an arithmetic mean of MAD

n
â MAD j
j =1

The normalized data is available online [11]. ATH1 probe
set-to-Locus ID mapping was obtained from TAIR, March
31st 2007 [78,79]. The experimental information is
included in Additional file 2.
Pathway Data
The choice of genes involved in each pathway was guided
by: Arabidopsis Lipid Gene Database for fatty acid synthesis genes [80,81]; Arabidopsis Starch Metabolism Network project [82] for starch metabolism; and original
references for leucine catabolism [42,83,84]. We further
considered each candidate gene based on original references.
Network of Coexpressed Genes
The 126 genes used in the initial network construction
(Fig. 2), including candidates for functions in fatty acid
synthesis, starch metabolism and leucine catabolism, are

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/76

shown in Additional file 1. A correlation matrix was calculated for these genes, using Pearson Product-Moment
Coefficient, defined as

r x ,y

n
â ( x i â x)(y i â y)
= i =1
(n â1)Î´ xÎ´ y

The values of Pearson correlations above 0.3 are statistically highly significant (p-value < 0.00001 after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing [85]). We additionally
assessed the validity of correlations higher than 0.6 by
performing 10,000 permutations of the corresponding
data vectors. Correlations that had a permutation-based
p-value < 0.0001 (in our case, all pairs of genes examined)
were considered for further analysis [see Additional file 4].
The networks in Fig. 2 were constructed by placing an edge
between any pair of genes correlated above the threshold.
Modules in the network were defined by the grouping
produced by the network visualization software.
Enrichment of Within-Pathway Edges in the Coexpression
Network
To test whether there are more correlations between the
genes from the same metabolic pathway (i.e. from fatty
acid biosynthesis, starch metabolism, or leucine catabolism category) than could be expected by chance, we compared the co-expression network from experimental data
(Fig. 2B) to 10,000 computationally generated random
networks. In these random networks the total number of
the edges and the number of neighbors for each node was
set to be the same as in the original graph. A function for
generating random graphs was implemented in R. It constructed graphs by random filling of the adjacency matrix,
where nodes' degrees were constrained and self-loops not
allowed. Indeed, the proportion of within-pathway edges
is significantly higher in our coexpression network compared to such proportions in random graphs (245/444
versus a mean of 112/444, which is equal to the difference
of ~20 standard deviations, Fig. 3).
Correlation with Hub Genes
The calculation of Pearson correlations between the three
hub-genes (At2g40840, At4g34030, At2g05990) and all
other genes on the chip (Table 1) was conducted in our
publicly available software, MetaOmGraph [11].
MetaOmGraph is able to handle large datasets with an
efficient use of memory and is integrated with other publicly available bioinformatics tools in MetNet Exchange
suit [86,87].

The genes belonging to catabolic supermodule [see Fig. 8

Starch Quantification
Two individual plants (100â400 mg fresh weight) were
boiled in 50 ml 80% (v/v) ethanol. The decolored plants
were then ground in 80% ethanol with a 2 ml Konte tissue
grinder, centrifuged for 10 min at 3,000 g at room temperature. The pellet was washed twice with 80% ethanol.
After centrifugation, the insoluble material was suspended in 1 ml of distilled water and boiled for 30 min.
Total starch was quantified using a commercial Glc assay
kit (catalog no. E0207748; R-Biopharm, Darmstadt, Germany), according to instructions in the kit protocol. The
assay employs amyloglucosidase to achieve complete
digestion of the starch sample to Glc, and measurement of
the Glc by application of a Glc oxidase reagent. The average of six biological replicates, using two individual plants
for each replicate, was calculated.
