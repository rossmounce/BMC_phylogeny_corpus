Abstract
Background: Proventricular dilatation disease (PDD) is a fatal disorder threatening domesticated and
wild psittacine birds worldwide. It is characterized by lymphoplasmacytic infiltration of the ganglia of the
central and peripheral nervous system, leading to central nervous system disorders as well as disordered
enteric motility and associated wasting. For almost 40 years, a viral etiology for PDD has been suspected,
but to date no candidate etiologic agent has been reproducibly linked to the disease.
Results: Analysis of 2 PDD case-control series collected independently on different continents using a
pan-viral microarray revealed a bornavirus hybridization signature in 62.5% of the PDD cases (5/8) and
none of the controls (0/8). Ultra high throughput sequencing was utilized to recover the complete viral
genome sequence from one of the virus-positive PDD cases. This revealed a bornavirus-like genome
organization for this agent with a high degree of sequence divergence from all prior bornavirus isolates.
We propose the name avian bornavirus (ABV) for this agent. Further specific ABV PCR analysis of an
additional set of independently collected PDD cases and controls yielded a significant difference in ABV
detection rate among PDD cases (71%, n = 7) compared to controls (0%, n = 14) (P = 0.01; Fisher's Exact
Test). Partial sequence analysis of a total of 16 ABV isolates we have now recovered from these and an
additional set of cases reveals at least 5 distinct ABV genetic subgroups.
Conclusion: These studies clearly demonstrate the existence of an avian reservoir of remarkably diverse
bornaviruses and provide a compelling candidate in the search for an etiologic agent of PDD.

Background
Proventricular dilatation disease (PDD) is considered by
many to be the greatest threat to aviculture of psittacine
birds (parrots). This disease has been documented in multiple continents in over 50 different species of psittacines
as well as captive and free-ranging species in at least 5
other orders of birds [1-5]. Most, if not all major psittacine
collections throughout the world have experienced cases
of PDD. It has been particularly devastating in countries
like Canada and northern areas of the United States where
parrots are housed primarily indoors. However, it is also
problematic in warmer regions where birds are typically
bred in outdoor aviaries. Moreover, captive breeding
efforts for at least one psittacine which is thought to be
extinct in the wild, the Spix's macaw (Cyanopsitta spixii),
have been severely impacted by PDD.
PDD is an inflammatory disease of birds, first described in
the 1970s as Macaw Wasting Disease during an outbreak
among macaws (reviewed in [3]). PDD primarily affects
the autonomic nerves of the upper and middle digestive
tract, including the esophagus, crop, proventriculus, ventriculus, and duodenum. Microscopically, the disease is
recognized by the presence of lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates within myenteric ganglia and nerves. Similar infiltrates may also be present in the brain, spinal cord,
peripheral nerves, conductive tissue of the heart, smooth
and cardiac muscle, and adrenal glands. Non-suppurative
leiomyositis and/or myocarditis may accompany the neural lesions [6-9]. Clinically, PDD cases present with GI
tract dysfunction (dysphagia, regurgitation, and passage
of undigested food in feces), neurologic symptoms (e.g.
ataxia, abnormal gait, proprioceptive defects), or both [3].
Although the clinical course of the disease can vary, it is
generally fatal in untreated animals [3].
The cause of PDD is unknown, but several studies have
raised the possibility that PDD may be caused by a viral
pathogen. Evidence for an infectious etiology stems from
the initial outbreaks of Macaw Wasting Disease, and other
subsequent outbreaks of PDD [2,10]. Reports of pleomorphic virus-like particles of variable size (30–250 nm)
observed in tissues of PDD affected birds [8] led to the
proposal that paramyxovirus (PMV) may cause the disease; however, serological data has shown that PDD
affected birds lack detectable antibodies against PMV of
serotypes 1–4, 6, and 7, as well as against avian herpes
viruses, polyomavirus, and avian encephalitis virus [3].
Similarly, a proposed role for equine encephalitis virus in
PDD has been ruled out [11]. Enveloped virus-like particles of approximately 80 nm in diameter derived from the
feces of affected birds have been shown to produce cytopathic effect in monolayers of macaw embryonic cells
[12], but to date no reports confirming these results or
identifying this possible agent have been published. Like-

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/88

wise, adeno-like viruses, enteroviruses, coronaviruses and
reoviruses have also been sporadically documented in tissues or excretions of affected birds [3,13,14] yet in each
case, follow-up evidence for reproducible isolation specifically from PDD cases or identification of these candidate
agents has not been reported. Thus, the etiology of PDD
has remained an open question.
To address this question, we have turned to a comprehensive, high throughput strategy to test for the presence of
known or novel viruses in PDD affected birds. We
employed the Virus chip, a DNA microarray containing
representation of all viral taxonomy to interrogate 2 PDD
case/control series independently collected on two different continents for the presence of viral pathogens. We
report here the detection of a novel bornavirus signature
in 62.5% of the PDD cases and none of the controls. These
bornavirus-positive samples were confirmed by virus-specific PCR testing, and the complete genome sequence has
been recovered by ultra-high throughput sequencing
combined with conventional PCR-based cloning.
Bornaviruses are a family of negative strand RNA viruses
whose prototype member is Borna Disease Virus (BDV),
an agent of encephalitis whose natural reservoir is primarily horses and sheep [15]. Although experimental transmission of BDV to many species (including chicks [16])
has been described, there is little information on natural
avian infection, and existing BDV isolates are remarkable
for their relative sequence homogeneity. The agent
reported here, which we designate avian bornavirus (ABV)
is highly diverged from all previously identified members
of the Bornaviridae family and represents the first fulllength bornavirus genome cloned directly from avian tissue. Subsequent PCR screening for similar ABVs confirmed a detection rate of approximately 70% among
PDD cases and none among the controls. Sequence analysis of a single complete genome and all of the additional
partial sequences that we have recovered directly from the
PDD case specimens suggests that the viruses detected in
cases of PDD form a new, genetically diverse clade of the
Bornaviridae.

Results
Microarray-based detection of a Bornaviridae signature in
PDD cases
To identify a possible viral cause of PDD, we applied the
Virus chip, a DNA microarray containing 70 mer oligonucleotide probes representing all known viral sequences
conserved at multiple nodes of the viral taxonomic tree
[17,18] to identify viral signatures unique to histologically confirmed cases of PDD. At the outset of this study,
specimens from two independently collected PDD case/
control series were available for this investigation (Figure
1, Materials and Methods). The first series (n = 8), from

samples originating in the United States, consisted of crop
biopsy specimens from 3 histologically confirmed PDD
cases and 5 controls that were provided for nucleic acid
extraction and follow-up Virus chip analysis. The samples
from the second series (n = 8) originated in Israel, where
total RNA and DNA from proventriculus, ventriculus and
brain specimens were extracted from 5 PDD cases and 3
controls. For each series, total RNA was reverse-transcribed with random primers, PCR-amplified, and fluorescently labeled and hybridized to the Virus chip
microarray as previously described [18].

host filter were next screened for the presence of bornavirus sequence through similar ELAND and iterative BLAST
analyses (Materials and Methods) using a database generated from all Borna Disease virus (BDV) sequences
present in NCBI (n = 207) and the sequences we had
recovered from PCR follow-up of the PDD samples that
tested positive for bornavirus by Virus chip microarray (n
= 5). These analyses provided us with 1400 reads with at
least a match of 15 or more nucleotides (blastn) or 7 or
more predicted amino acids (tblastx) to known BDV
sequences.

In these combined PDD case/control series, a Bornaviridae
signature was detectable in 62.5% of the cases and none
of the controls (Table 1). In the US cohort, which contained only GI tract specimens, we detected a bornavirus
in 2 of 3 cases. Surprisingly, in samples from the Israeli
PDD case/control series for which we had both GI tract
and brain specimen RNA for each animal, we detected the
Bornaviridae signature in 3 of the cases, but only in samples derived from brain tissue. These signatures were
unambiguously confirmed by follow-up PCR and
sequence recovery, using primers based on the sequences
of the most strongly annealing Bornaviridae oligonucleotides on the microarray (Figure 2, Array probes and PCR
probes tracks). These analyses revealed the presence of a
set of surprisingly divergent avian bornaviruses (ABVs) in
the PDD cases; the recovered sequences shared less than
70% sequence identity to any of the previously identified
mammalian bornavirus isolates in the NCBI database.

Mapping these 1400 reads onto their corresponding positions on a consensus sequence for the 14 publicly available BDV genome sequences revealed spikes of high read
coverage distributed discontinuously across the entire
span of the BDV genome consensus. Reads containing
blastn scores ≥ 90% identity to known BDV sequences
were used as source sequences for primer design for PCR
and sequence recovery of additional bornavirus sequence
from both mRNA and vRNA templates present in the PDD
specimen. Sequences recovered in this manner facilitated
subsequent primer design for recovery of complete
genome sequence via RT-PCR of 3 large overlapping fragments of the genome and 5'- and 3'-RACE (Figure 2A,
vRNA RT-PCR track) directly from negative stranded
vRNA present in the total RNA extracted from this clinical
specimen.

Recovery of complete genome sequence of a divergent
avian bornavirus (ABV) from a PDD case via ultra highthroughput sequencing and conventional RT-PCR
To determine if the sequence fragments we detected
among specimens derived from PDD cases corresponded
to the presence of a full-length bornavirus, we performed
unbiased deep sequencing on a PCR-confirmed bornavirus positive PDD case that contained the highest concentration of RNA. To recover both mRNA and vRNA present
in the sample, RNA from this specimen was linearly
amplified with both oligo(dT) and random hexamer
primers, and then PCR-amplified using a modified random amplification strategy compatible with the Solexa
sequencing platform (Materials and Methods). An initial
set of 1.4 million 33 mer reads was obtained from this
template material. Filtering on read quality, insert presence, and sequence complexity reduced this data set to
600,000 unique reads. Additional ELAND and iterative
BLAST analyses ([19] Materials and Methods) of these
reads against all avian sequences in NCBI (including ESTs,
n = 918,511) identified reads in the dataset with at least
22 nucleotides of sequence identity likely derived from
host transcripts randomly amplified during sequencing
sample preparation. The 322,790 reads that passed this

As our initial PCR results suggested, the bornavirus
genome sequence we recovered is quite diverged from all
known BDV genomes, including the BDV isolate No/98, a
divergent isolate sharing only 81% sequence identity with
all other BDV genomes [20]. Overall, this newly recovered
bornavirus genome sequence shares only 64% sequence
identity at the nucleotide level to each of the complete
BDV genomes. Scanning pairwise sequence identity analysis indicates this genetic divergence exists across the
entire genome (Figure 2A, Sequence identity shared with
BDV genomes track). Given this divergence, we re-examined the depth and distribution of the 322,790 reads from
this specimen that passed the host filter to determine if we
had missed reads derived from the recovered ABV in our
initial screen against all BDV sequences. Not surprisingly,
this retrospective BLAST analysis revealed an additional
2600 reads from across the recovered bornavirus genome
that were missed in the initial BLAST analyses due to the
lack of sequence conservation between the ABV sequence
and the available BDV sequences (Figure 2A, Solexa reads
track). In total, approximately 1% of all the high throughput shotgun reads could be mapped to the recovered bornavirus genome.
Despite this sequence divergence, this avian bornavirus
genomic sequence possesses all of the hallmarks of a Bor-

naviridae family member (Figure 2A): six distinct ORFs
encoding homologs of the N, X, P, M, G, and L genes are
detectable. Likewise, non-coding regulatory sequence elements (the inverted terminal repeat sequences ([21], see
Additional file 1: Alignment of bornavirus genomes 5'
and 3' termini), the transcription initiation and termination sites ([22], see Additional file 2: Alignment of transcription initiation and termination sites in bornavirus
genomes), and each of the signals for pre-mRNA splicing
([23], see Additional file 3: Alignment of splice donor and
acceptor sequences in bornavirus genomes) are all conserved in sequence and location, with the exception of the
splice acceptor site 3 at position 4560 that has been previously found in a subset, but not all BDV genomes [24,25].
Taken together, these data provide evidence that our analysis has uncovered a novel divergent avian bornavirus
(ABV) present in cases of PDD.
Phylogenetic and pairwise sequence analyses support this
conclusion. Genomic and sub-genomic phylogenetic
analyses of nucleotide sequences place the recovered ABV
sequence on a branch distant from representative members of the 4 distinct genetic isolates of BDV for which
complete genome sequences are available (Figure 2B, see
Additional file 4: Phylogenetic relationships between subgenomic loci of ABV and representative BDV genomes).
Strikingly, the ABV genome sequence segregates to a position virtually equidistant from both the set of 3 closely
related BDV isolates (V/Ref, H1766, and He/80) and the
divergent No/98 BDV isolate (Figure 2B). Moreover, in
contrast to the previously identified divergent No/98 isolate, which retains a high level of conservation with other
BDV isolates at the amino acid level, the ABV isolate also
shows significant sequence divergence in the predicted
amino acid sequence of every ORF in the genome (Table
2).

in our PDD specimens. With these results in hand, we
designed a set of PCR primers to perform ABV-specific
PCR screening of an independent set of PDD case and
control specimens to investigate the association between
the presence of ABV and clinical signs and symptoms of
PDD. An additional set of 21 samples derived from upper
GI tract specimens (crop, proventriculus or ventriculus)
from PDD cases and controls were screened for ABV
sequences in a blinded fashion (Materials and Methods).
For this analysis, we targeted three regions of the genome:
1) the L gene region of the genome that we used for PCR
confirmation of the microarray results, (Figure 2, PCR
probes track), 2) a subregion within the N gene and 3) a
subregion within the M gene (Materials and Methods).
PCR for glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) mRNA was performed in parallel with the ABV
PCR on all specimens to control for integrity of RNA provided from each specimen. Of the 21 specimens analyzed,
5 were positive for ABV by PCR and confirmed by
sequence recovery. Unmasking the clinical status of these
samples revealed that 7 of the samples were derived from
confirmed PDD cases and 14 samples were derived from
PDD controls. Among the PDD cases, we found 71% (5/
7) to be positive by ABV PCR (Table 3). In contrast, all
PDD controls were negative by ABV PCR, and positive
only for GAPDH mRNA. This PCR analysis provides an
independent test of the statistical significance of the association between the presence of ABV and histologically
confirmed PDD (P = 0.01, Fisher's Exact Test). Although
we do not observe ABV in 100% of PDD cases in this series
(see Discussion), our results nonetheless indicate a significant association of ABV with PDD.
Additional ABV isolates identified through PCR screening
Because we applied stringent inclusion criteria for the
above-described association analysis study, a number of
ABV (+) and ABV (-) samples were excluded. From these
materials, six additional ABV isolates were detected – 5
derived from cases considered clinically suspicious and a
sixth isolate derived from a confirmed PDD case for which
only GI content and liver specimens were available. Additional PCR screening of a set of 12 PDD control crop
biopsy specimens provided to us unblinded again yielded
solely ABV PCR (-) and GAPDH (+) results. These samples
were excluded from the association analysis because we
knew their clinical status prior to screening. We note that
inclusion of these samples in statistical analyses would
not diminish the association of ABV with known or suspected PDD.
Sequence analysis of ABV isolates indicates at least 5
divergent isolates in this branch of the Bornaviridae family

pected PDD cases (Materials and Methods)) from 3 distinct regions of the ABV genome provided the opportunity
to further investigate the genetic diversity within this new
branch of the Bornaviridae. Here, our description of results
is restricted to comparison with representative members
of the 4 major isolates of BDV, but virtually identical
results were obtained when all available BDV sequences
were analyzed.

shared across this region of the genome among the ABV
branches of the tree ranges from 77–83% at the nucleotide level and 86–94% at the amino acid level. Taken
together with the phylogenetic analysis described above,
these data provide evidence that these ABV isolates form a
new, genetically diverse branch of the Bornaviridae phylogeny that is significantly diverged from the founder BDV
isolates.

As we observed for the complete ABV genome sequence,
phylogenetic analysis of the recovered subgenomic ABV
sequences revealed that each of the ABV isolates we recovered resides on a branch distant from the BDV isolates
(Figure 3). PCR with the L gene consensus primers
detected 14 isolates corresponding to 4 genetic subgroups
of ABV. Each of these isolates were also detected with at
least one of primer sets corresponding to the more highly
expressed N gene and more conserved M gene regions of
the genome; however, PCR with these two additional
primer sets identified 2 additional ABV isolates that segregate to a genetically distinct 5th subgroup among the ABVs
(ABV5, Figure 3B and 3C). Although these 5 distinct
branches correlate largely according to the geographic origin of the isolates, the genetic diversity we detect cannot
be ascribed solely to differences in geographic origin of
the isolates, since one of the branches (ABV4) is comprised of isolates derived from both the U.S. and Israel.
Likewise, we did not detect an obvious correlation
between host species and genetic subgroup of ABV among
the recovered isolates.

Discussion

Pairwise sequence analyses of the nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence from the L region of the
genome provide additional evidence for surprising
genetic diversity among the ABV branches compared to
that seen among the BDV branches (Table 4). Although
derived from coding sequences of one of the more divergent genes of the bornavirus genome (Table 2, L gene), the
region of the L gene we have used for PCR screening is relatively conserved among the BDV isolates, ranging from
81–98% at the nucleotide level, and 96–99% at the amino
acid level (Table 4). In contrast, the sequence identity

It has been almost 40 years since the first description of
PDD. Although a viral etiology has long been suspected, a
convincing lead for a responsible viral pathogen has been
lacking. By combining veterinary clinical investigation
with genomics and molecular biology, we have identified
a genetically diverse set of novel avian bornaviruses
(ABVs) that are likely to play a significant role in this disease. Through microarray analysis and follow-up PCR, we
detected ABV sequences in 62.5% of the PDD cases in a set
of specimens from two carefully collected PDD case/control series originating from two different continents. We
confirmed that these assays faithfully reflect the presence
of full-length bornavirus in ABV PCR positive specimens
through cloning of the complete ABV vRNA sequence
directly from RNA extracted from one of these ABV PCR
positive PDD case specimens. We next found evidence for
a significant association between the presence of ABV and
clinically confirmed PDD in follow-up blinded PCR
screening of a set of additional PDD cases and controls,
with ABV was detected in 71% of PDD cases and none of
the controls (P = 0.01, Fisher's Exact Test).
Almost all prior sightings of bornaviruses in nature have
been among mammals, and the mammalian isolates have
been remarkably homogeneous at the sequence level
(Table 2 and [15]). The latter is a surprising feature for
RNA viruses, whose RNA-dependent RNA polymerases
typically have high error rates. By contrast, the ABV isolates reported here are quite diverged from their mammalian counterparts, and show substantial heterogeneity
among themselves. We note with interest that a single earlier report suggesting a potential avian reservoir for borna-

viruses has been presented [26]. In that study, RT-PCR
based on mammalian BDV sequences was used to recover
partial sequences from stool collected near duck ponds
where wild waterfowl congregate. However, the resulting
sequences shared ca. 98% amino acid sequence homology
to the mammalian BDVs, raising the possibility that these
putative avian sequences might have resulted from possible environmental or laboratory contamination [15]. Our
ABV isolates, which are unequivocally of avian origin, are
clearly very different from these sequences; it remains to
be seen if other wild birds can indeed harbor BDV-like
agents. The expanded sequence diversity of the bornaviruses discovered here should facilitate design of PCR
primers that will enable expanded detection of diverse
bornaviral types in future epidemiological studies.
The known neurotropism of bornaviruses makes them
attractive and biologically plausible candidate etiologic
agents in PDD, since (i) PDD cases have well-described
neurological symptoms such as ataxia, proproceptive
defects and motor abnormalities; and (ii) the central GI
tract pathology in the disorder results from inflammation
and destruction of the myenteric ganglia that control peristaltic activity. However, despite our success in ABV
detection in PDD, we did not observe ABV in every PDD
case analyzed. There are several possible explanations for
this result. First, we do not know the tissue distribution
(tropism) of ABV infection, or how viral copy number
may vary at different sites as a function of the stage of the
disease. By weighting our sample collection towards clinically overt PDD, we may have biased specimen accrual
towards advanced disease. At this stage, where destruction
of myenteric ganglial elements is often extensive, loss of
infected cells may have contributed to detection difficulties (We note with interest in this context that in one of
our case collections from Israel, virus detection occurred
preferentially in CNS rather than in GI specimens). There
are many precedents for such temporal variation in clinical virology – for example, in chronic hepatitis B viral
loads typically decline by several orders of magnitude over
the long natural history of the infection [27]. It is also possible that our detection rate may merely reflect suboptimal selection of PCR primers employed for screening;
after all, our consensus primer selection was based on
sequences we had recovered (L gene consensus primers)
or sequence homology between the first fully sequenced

ABV genome we recovered and a set of highly related
mammalian BDV genome sequences (N and M gene consensus primers). We now recognize that there is substantial sequence variation within the ABVs (see Fig. 3); as
more sequence diversity is recognized, better choices for
more highly conserved primers will become apparent and
could impact upon these prevalence estimates.
Finally, there could actually be multiple etiologic agents
in PDD, with ABV infection accounting for only ~70% of
the cases. Certainly both human and veterinary medicine
are replete with examples of multiple agents that can trigger the same clinical syndrome – for example, at least 5
genetically unrelated viruses (hepatitis viruses A-E) are
associated with acute hepatitis, and at least 3 of these can
be implicated in chronic liver injury; similarly, several
agents (RSV, rhinoviruses and occasionally influenza
viruses) are implicated in bronchiolitis. To investigate this
possibility, further high-throughput sequencing analysis
of PDD cases that were negative for bornaviruses by PCR
screening is currently underway.
Although ABV is clearly a leading candidate etiologic
agent in PDD, formally establishing a causal role for ABV
in PDD will require further experimentation. Such experiments could include (i) attempts to satisfy Koch's postulates via cultivation of ABV, followed by experimental
transmission of infection and disease in inoculees, (ii)
examination of seroprevalence rates in flocks with high
and low PDD incidences, (iii) documentation of seroconversion accompanying development of PDD-like illnesses
and (iv) examination of PDD cases by immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridization for evidence of colocalization of ABV infection at sites of histopathology. The
recovery and characterization of a complete ABV genome
and multiple isolates from this diverse new branch of the
Bornaviridae family now opens the door to such investigations.

Conclusion
By combining clinical veterinary medical investigation
with comprehensive pan-viral microarray and high
throughput sequence analyses, we have identified a highly
diverged set of avian bornaviruses directly from tissues of
PDD cases, but not controls. These results are significant
for a number of reasons. First, they provide a compelling
lead in the long-standing search for a viral etiology of
PDD, and pave the way for further investigations to assess
the link between ABV and PDD. Second, these results also
unambiguously demonstrate the existence of an avian reservoir of bornaviruses, expanding our understanding of
the bornavirus host range. Finally, these results also provide the first evidence that the Bornaviridae family is not
confined to a set of genetically homogeneous species as

heretofore unanticipated genetically diverse viral species.

United States PDD case/control series
Specimen collection
All specimens provided for initial screening were crop tissue biopsies obtained from live psittacine birds to be used
as normal controls or multiple tissue samples collected
from clinically diseased birds at the time of euthanasia.
Specimens were collected from client-owned birds from
approximately August 2006 to May 2008 (All samples collected by S. Clubb). All of these samples originated from
the southeast region of Florida. Crop biopsy tissue was
collected from live birds under isoflurane anaesthesia.
Following routine surgical preparation and sterile technique, the skin was incised over the center of the crop. The
crop tissue was exposed and a section of tissue removed
taking care to include large visible blood vessels. Fresh
crop biopsy tissue was trimmed into tissue slices < 5 mm
thick and submersed in RNAlater (Qiagen, Inc., USA,
Valencia, CA) solution immediately upon harvest and frozen within 2 minutes of collection at -20°C to -80°C
according to manufacturer's protocol, and held in this
manner until shipped. A duplicate sample was fixed in
10% buffered formalin for routine histological examination with H & E stain. Time of frozen storage varied (2
weeks to 12 months) as samples were accumulated prior
to shipping frozen. Clinically affected birds submitted as
positives were euthanized under isoflurane anaesthesia
and mixed tissues (proventriculus, ventriculus, heart,
liver, spleen, kidneys, brain) were placed into RNAlater
within 1 minute of death and frozen within 2 minutes of
death. Duplicate samples were collected for histopathologic diagnosis of PDD.
Inclusion criteria
PDD-positive cases were required to meet the following
criteria 1) Clinical history of characteristic wasting/malabsorption syndrome with dilation of the proventriculus
and/or ventriculus and presence of undigested food in the
stool and in most cases, a clinical history of ataxia or other
CNS signs consistent with clinical PDD, and 2) histopathology confirming the presence of moderate to extensive
lymphoplasmacytic ganglioneuritis affecting crop tissue
and at least one of the following additional areas: proven-

triculus, ventriculus, brain, adrenal gland, or myocardium. PDD-negative controls were required to be from
birds with no evidence of lymphoplasmacytic neurogangliitis on histopathology derived either from 1) normal
birds with no clinical history of PDD or no known exposure to PDD or 2) birds which died of other causes. Crop
biopsies from samples from living birds classified as suspicious cases were also submitted. Suspicious cases were
defined histologically as having lymphocytes and plasma
cells surrounding neurons but not infiltrating into the
neurons. An additional specimen derived from a live bird
raised with two necropsy-confirmed PDD birds in Virginia
was also collected for analysis. Here, only cloacal swab
and blood specimens were available and the lack of histopathological confirmation and crop tissue excluded this
specimen from the ABV-PDD association analysis. However, we did perform ABV PCR on these clinically suspicious specimens and the resulting viral sequences isolated
were included in the subsequent comparative sequence
analyses.
RNA extractions
For RNA extractions, specimens were thawed in RNALater,
sliced into 0.5 mm × 0.5 mm pieces, transferred to 2 ml of
RNABee solution (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX),
homogenized with freeze thawing and scapel mincing,
then extracted in the presence of chloroform according to
manufacterer's instructions. Resulting RNA was next incubated with DNase (DNA-free, Applied Biosystems/
Ambion, Austin, TX) to remove any potential contaminating DNA present in the specimen.
Israeli case/control series
Specimen collection
Tissue samples were obtained from psittacine birds submitted to the Division of Avian and Fish Diseases, Kimron
Veterinary Institute (KVI) Bet Dagan, Israel, for diagnostic

necropsy between July 2004 and March 2008. A few additional specimens were obtained through private veterinarians. Some tissues were kept for nearly 4 years frozen
either at -20°C or -80°C prior to testing, while others were
fresh tissues from recent cases. The types of banked frozen
tissue varied from case to case, while for some of the older
cases only gastrointestinal content had been banked. Clinical histories for these birds were available from the submission forms or through communication with the
submitting veterinarians. The results of ancillary tests performed at the KVI were available through the KVI computerized records.
Inclusion criteria
Only cases for which appropriate histological sections
were available for inspection were considered for this
study. These had to include brain and at least two of the
following tissues: crop, proventriculus, ventriculus. The
tissue-types examined for each bird for which specimens
were provided are listed in Data File S1. PDD-positive
cases were required to have evidence of lymphoplasmacytic infiltration of myenteric nerves and/or ganglia
within one or more of the upper GI tract tissues mentioned above. These were all derived from birds that had
been suspected to have PDD based on their clinical case
histories and/or necropsy findings. PDD-negative controls had no detectable lesions and no evidence of nonsuppurative encephalitis. For most birds in the PDD-negative group, a cause of death (other than PDD) has been
determined. Two birds that came from a known PDD outbreak, but showed only cerebral lymphoplasmacytic
perivascular cuffing, were classified as 'suspicious'. These
were excluded from the statistical analysis, as were all
other birds for which a PDD status could not be clearly
determined and classified as 'inconclusive' (e.g. due to
poor tissue preservation, poor section quality, or scarcity
of myenteric nerves within the tissues examined).

RNA extraction
When possible, a sample of brain as well as a combined
proventricular/ventricular sample was prepared for RNA
extraction for each bird. If not available, other tissues and/
or gastrointestinal content were used (see Additional file
5: Summary of clinical and molecular data for specimens
provided in this study). Frozen samples were allowed to
thaw for 1–2 hours at room temperature prior to handling. Then, under a laminar flow biohazard hood and
using aseptic technique, approximately 1 cm3 of each tissue was macerated by two passages through a 2.5 ml sterile syringe and transferred into sterile test tubes
containing 4 ml nuclease-free PBS. The content of the
tubes was mixed by vortex for 30 sec, and the tubes were
placed overnight at 4°C. RNA extraction was performed
on the following day, using either the QIAamp® viral RNA
kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA; batch1&2, specimens 1–8) or
the TRI Reagent® kit (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH; all other specimens), following the manufacturers' instructions. The end product was either provided
lyophilized (batches 1 and 2, samples 1–9) as a dry pellet,
or re-suspended in 40 ul nuclease-free water.
Virus chip hybridization experiments
Microarray analysis of specimens was carried out as previously described [18]. Briefly, 50–200 ng of DNAse-treated
total RNA from each sample was amplified and labelled
using a random-primed amplification protocol and
hybridized to the Virochip. Microarrays (NCBI GEO platform GPL3429) were scanned with an Axon 4000B scanner (Axon Instruments). Virochip results were analyzed
using E-Predict [28] and vTaxi (K. Fischer et al., in preparation).
PCR primers for detection of avian bornaviruses
Microarray-based Bornaviridae PCR primers
Initial PCR primers were generated based on two of the 70
mer microarray probes with hybridization signal in the
Bornaviridae positive arrays that localize to positions
3676–3745 and 4201–4270 of the Bornaviridae reference
sequence [GenBank:NC_001607]. Subsequences within
each of these probes (BDV_LconsensusF: 5'CCTCGCGAGGAGGAGACGCCTC-3'
and
BDV_LconsensusR: 5' CTGCTCTTGGCTGTGTCTGCTGC3'; positions 3710–3729 and 4252–4230, respectively of
the NCBI Bornaviridae reference sequence) that are 100%
conserved across the 12 other fully sequenced bornavirus
genome isolates in NCBI (huP2br [GenBank:AB258389],

lized for initial follow-up PCR and sequence confirmation
of microarray screening results. Briefly, 1 ul of the randomly amplified nucleic acid prepared for microarray
hybridization from all specimens was utilized as template
for 35 cycles of PCR, under the following conditions:
94°C, 30 seconds; 50°C, 30 seconds; 72°C, 30 seconds.
Resulting PCR products were gel purified, subcloned into
the TOPO TA cloning vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen, USA,
Carlsbad CA) and sequenced with M13F and M13R primers.
Generation of ABV consensus PCR primers
Sequences recovered from BDV_LconsensusF and
BDV_LconsensusR PCR products were aligned, and an
additional set of ABV consensus primers biased towards
the ABV sequences were identified: ABV_LconsensusF, 5'CGCCTCGGAAGGTGGTCGG-3' (maps to positions
aligning with residues 3724–3742 of BDV reference
genome) and ABV_LconsensusR, 5'-GGCAYCAYCKACTCTTRAYYGTRTCAGC-3' (maps to positions aligning
with residues 4233–4257 of BDV reference genome).
Using identical PCR cycling conditions as described above
for the microarray-based Bornaviridae PCR assay, these
ABV consensus primers were found to be > 100X more
sensitive
for
ABV
detection
compared
to
BDV_LconsensusF and BDV_LconsensusR primers, and
were thus utilized to re-screen the initial set of PDD case
and control samples provided for microarray analysis (no
additional positives identified) and all subsequently provided samples. Two additional PCR primers in the N
(ABV_NconsensusF:
5'-CCHCATGAGGCTATWGATTGGATTAACG-3' and ABV_NconsensusR: 5'-GCMCGGTAGCCNGCCATTGTDGG-3')
and
M
(ABV_MconsensusF:
5'-GGRCAAGGTAATYGTYCCTGGATGGCC-3' and ABV_PconsensusR: 5'-CCAACACCAATGTTCCGAAGMCG-3') that mapped to conserved
sequences shared between the complete ABV genome
sequence and the 14 other fully sequenced BDV genomes
in the NCBI database were also employed for PCR screening of PDD cases and controls.
Ultra high-throughput sequencing
Sample preparation and sequencing
500 ng of total RNA derived from one of the PDD case
specimens was linearly amplified via modification of the
MesssageAmp aRNA kit (Applied Biosystems/Ambion,
Austin, TX). To ensure the amplification of both mRNA
and vRNA present in the specimen, T7-tailed random
nonamer was mixed in an equimolar ratio with the manufacturer-provided T7-oligo(dT) primer during the 1st
strand synthesis step. The resulting aRNA was next used as
input for a modified version of Genomic DNA sample
preparation protocol for ultra high-throughput Solexa
sequencing (Illumina, Hayward, CA). 400 ng of the input
aRNA was reverse-transcribed with reverse transcriptase

(Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Mountain View, CA) using a
random nonamer tailed with 19 bp of the Solexa Long (5'CACGACGCTCTTCCGATCTNNNNNNNNN-3') primer
sequence (Illumina, Hayward CA). Following termination
of reaction, first strand cDNA products were purified from
the reaction with Qiagen MinElute spin column (Qiagen
USA, Valencia CA). To ensure stringent separation from
primers, the MinElute eluate was then filtered through a
Microcon YM30 centrifugal filter (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA). The resulting eluate served as template for 2nd
strand synthesis in a standard Sequenase 2.0 (USB, Cleveland, OH) reaction primed with a random nonamer tailed
with
22
bp
(5'-GGCATACGA
GCTCTTCCGATCTNNNNNNNNN-3') of the Solexa Short primer
sequence (Illumina, Hayward CA). Double-stranded DNA
products were separated from primers and very short
products through a second Qiagen MinElute spin column
run followed by a Microcon YM50 centrifugal filter. This
eluate was used as template for 10 cycles of PCR amplification with the full length Solexa L and S primers using
KlenTaq LA DNA polymerase mix (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO). PCR product was purified from the reaction
with a MinElute spin column. Following cluster generation, Solexa sequencing primer was annealed to the flow
cell, and 36 cycles of single base pair extensions were performed with image capture using a 1G Genome Analyzer
(Illumina, Hayward, CA). The Solexa Pipeline software
suite version 0.2.2.6 (Illumina, Hayward, CA) was utilized
for base calling from these images. Using software default
quality filters, cycles 4–36 were deemed high quality,
resulting in a total of 1.4 million 33 mer reads for downstream sequence analyses.
Identification of Bornaviridae reads
Reads sharing 100% identity to each other or the Solexa
amplification primers were filtered, reducing our initial
set of 1.4 million reads to a working set of 600,000 unique
reads. In order to quickly assess the homology of this set
of reads to different sequence databases, we employed an
iterative strategy using ELAND (Efficient Local Alignment
of Nucleotide Data) and BLAST analyses. To filter reads
from our analysis potentially derived from psittacine host
tissue, the working set of reads were aligned to a database
of all Aves sequences from NCBI (n = 918,511) using
ELAND, which tolerates no more than 2 base mismatches,
and discards both low quality reads and reads with low
sequence complexity. Reads that did not align to the Aves
database by ELAND analysis were next re-aligned to the
Aves database for high stringency blastn analysis (e = 10-7,
word size = 11), followed by progressively lower stringencies (down to e = 10-2, word size = 8), corresponding to
reads containing only 22 nucleotide identities to
sequences in the Aves database. To identify reads with
some homology to Bornaviridae sequences in the resulting
set of 322,790 host-filtered reads, we re-implemented the

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/88

ELAND/iterative blastn analysis strategy (down to ≥ 15
nucleotides identity) using a database of all NCBI BDV
sequences (n = 207) augmented by our previously recovered ABV sequences (n = 5). An additional iterative tblastx
analysis was incorporated to capture distantly related
reads that shared similarity to the known BDV sequences
only at the level of predicted amino acid sequence (down
to ≥ 6 amino acid identity).
Complete ABV vRNA genome sequence recovery by RTPCR
Initial genome sequence recovery
Sequences from 33 mer reads from the deep sequencing
with a minimum of 91% sequence identity with known
BDV sequences present in the NCBI database were utilized
to generate a set of primers for additional cloning and
sequence recovery by RT-PCR of both mRNA and vRNA
present in the clinical specimen. In this manner, we generated a hybrid assembly derived from multiple overlapping clones and 5' RACE products encompassing the ABV
genome sequence.
vRNA genome sequence recovery
To ensure recovery of accurate sequence across the ABV
genome, especially at splice junctions and transcription
initiation and termination sites, we utilized the sequence
from ABV hybrid assembly to design primers for recovery
of 3 overlapping products by RT-PCR directed against the
vRNA present in the specimen. Aliquots of 500 ng of
DNAse-treated total RNA extracted from the clinical specimen were annealed with 3 primers complementary to the
predicted vRNA sequences: ABV1r, 5'-ATGACCAGGACGAGGAGATG-3' (maps to residues 8831-8812 of vRNA),
ABV2r, 5'-CCTGTGAATGTCTCGTTTCTG-3' (maps to residues 5754-5733 of vRNA), and ABV3r 5-TTCTTTCAGCAACCACTGACG-3' (maps to residues 2563-2543 of
vRNA). Reverse transcription was carried out at 50°C for
1 hr with SuperScriptIII (Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA) according to manufacturer's instructions. Following RNase H
treatment, PCR was performed on the resulting cDNA
with Phusion polymerase (NEB, Ipswich, MA) with the
primers used for reverse transcription and the following
primers: ABV1f: 5'-GGATCATTCCTTGATGATGTATTAGC3', (maps to residues 5567-5589) ABV2f: 5'-CAAATGGAGAGCCTGATTGG-3' (maps to residues 2378-2397)
ABV3f: 5'-AATCGGTAAGTCCAGAGTCAAGG-3' (maps to
residues 155-177). All products were amplified for 35
cycles under the following conditions: 98°C, 3 minutes;
98°C, 10 seconds, 50°C, 30 seconds, 72°C 3 minutes.
Resulting products were gel purified, and subcloned into
the TOPO T/A cloning vector pCR2.1 after incubation
with Taq polymerase and dATP for 10 minutes at 72°C.
For each product, 4 independent transformants were prepared for standard dideoxy sequencing on an ABI3730
sequencer (ElimBio, Hayward CA). Forward and reverse

reads spanning each clone were generated using M13F
and M13R and additional overlapping primers spaced at
600–800 bp intervals across the each of the clones.
5' and 3' RACE to sequence at vRNA termini
vRNA RT-PCR products containing uncapped vRNA termini were captured using the First Choice RLM RACE kit
(Ambion, Austin TX) with the following modifications to
the standard protocol: 1) tobacco acid phosphotase treatment was omitted, 2) a phosphorylated RNA, RNAligate,
5'-p-GUUAUCACUUUCACCC-3' (gift of J. Shock, DeRisi
lab) was substituted for the 3' RNA ligation-mediated
RACE primer provided in the kit and ligated to 3' ends as
per manufacterer's 5' RACE protocol, and 3) in the 3'
RACE reverse transcription reactions, two reverse transcription reactions were performed and carried forward in
parallel: one with random decamers and one with a DNA
oligo complementary to oJSmer utilized in the RNA ligation step (ligateRC, 5'-p-GGGTGAAAGTGATAAC-3'). For
5' RACE, a single round of PCR was sufficient to generate
a product using the vRNA specific primer ABV5RaceOuter,
5'-CAGTCGGTTCTTGGACTTGAAGTATCTAGG-3' (maps
to residues 346-317 of vRNA) and manufacturer provided
outer PCR primer. For 3' RACE, nested PCR was required
to recover detectable PCR product of expected size using
outer PCR primers oJSmerRC and the gene specific primer
ABV3RaceOuter, 5'-CCCGTCTACTGTTCTTTCGCCG-3'
(maps to residues 8479-8497 of vRNA), followed by inner
PCR
using
Tailed_RNAligateRC,
5'AAGCAGTGGTAACAACGCAGAGTACGGGTGAAAGTGATAAC-3' and the gene specific primer, ABV3RaceInner,
5'-GCAATCCAGGAATAAGCAAGCACAAA-3' (maps to
residues 8595-8620 of vRNA). Both of the RACE PCR
reactions were carried out with Platinum Taq polymerase
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in 35 cycles of gradient PCR
(with varying annealing temperature): 94°C, 30 seconds;
55–58°C, 30 seconds; 72°C, 30 seconds. Resulting PCR
products were gel purified and subcloned into TOPO T/A
cloning vector pCR 4.0. For the 5' RACE products, 7 independent transformants from 3 independently generated
PCR products were subcloned and sequenced with M13F
and M13R primers. For the 3' RACE products, 6 independent transformants from 4 independently generated PCR
products were subcloned and sequenced with M13F and
M13R primers. Terminal sequences reported here reflect
the majority consensus sequence obtained from these
reads.
Genome sequence assembly
Genome sequence assemblies from both initial genome
sequence recovery and vRNA genome sequence recovery
were generated using Consed, version 16.0 software [29].
All bases from the resulting vRNA genome sequence
assembly are covered at least 4× with a minimum Phred
value of 20.

Blinded PCR screening of additional PDD cases and
controls
Beyond the initial set of 16 specimens provided for microarray analysis, specimens from a total of 38 additional
PDD cases, PDD controls, and PDD suspicious birds with
varied clinical histories were provided to us blinded by
our 2 collaborators (see Additional file 5: Summary of
clinical and molecular data for specimens provided in this
study).
Sample processing
For specimens provided in tissue form from the US collaborators, total RNA was extracted as described above with
RNABee, DNase treated, then reverse-transcribed and
PCR-amplified according to our random amplification
protocol for microarray sample preparation (Materials
and Methods). Specimens provided from Israel in the
form of extracted RNA were similarly DNAse-treated and
amplified prior to PCR screening.
PCR screening
1 ul of the randomly amplified material generated from
these RNA samples was used as input template for ABV
consensus PCRs as described above. In parallel, as an
independent control for input specimen RNA integrity,
PCR for glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) mRNA was performed on all specimens using
designed based on Friedman-Einat et al [30] and Gallu gallus GAPDH sequence: Gg_GAPDHf: 5'-AGTCATCCCTGAGCTSAAYGG*GAAGC-3' (bp708-733 in Gallus gallus
cDNA (NCBI accession NM_204305), * indicates the
junction of GAPDH exon 8 and 9 spanned by this
primer),
Gg_GAPDHr
5'-ACCATCAAGTCCACAACACGG-3' (Spans bp 1037-1017 in Gallus gallus
GAPDH cDNA (NCBI accession NM_204305), maps to
GAPDH exon 12). After PCR results were tallied, clinical
information on all specimens tested was unmasked. A
complete accounting of ABV, GAPDH PCR results, specimen type and clinical status is provided in Additional file
5: Summary of clinical and molecular data for specimens
provided in this study.
Sample inclusion for association analysis
To reduce potential confounding due to differences in
viral detection resulting from specimen tissue source, only
specimens derived from upper GI tract tissue (crop, proventriculus/ventriculus) that tested positive by GAPDH
mRNA PCR were included in association analysis presented in Table 3. This consisted of a total of 21 specimens, 7 of which were derived from histologically
confirmed PDD cases and 14 derived from histologically
negative control specimens.

Samples excluded from association analysis
The remaining 17 samples were excluded from the analysis because they were either 1) GAPDH-positive or
GAPDH-negative samples derived from specimen other
than upper GI tract tissue (GI content, brain, liver, or
intestine) or 2) derived from cases that were histologically
or clinically 'suspicious', but unconfirmed PDD cases. Six
additional ABV PCR positives were identified among this
set of samples excluded from the statistical analyses: 1
derived from GI content from a confirmed PDD case, and
5 derived from a variety of tissues from the PDD suspicious cases.
Phylogenetic and comparative sequence analysis
Multiple sequence alignments of complete genome
sequences or partial sequences derived from PCR screening studies were generated with ClustalW [31] version
1.83. Resulting alignments were used for scanning pairwise sequence analysis (window size, 100; step size 1
nucleotide steps). Additional ClustalW alignments and
neighbor-joining phylogenetic trees were generated using
Mega software, version 4.0.2 [32].
