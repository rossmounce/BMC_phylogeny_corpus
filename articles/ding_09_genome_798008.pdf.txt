Abstract
Background: Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 14 is one of the most common pneumococcal
serotypes that cause invasive pneumococcal diseases worldwide. Serotype 14 often expresses
resistance to a variety of antimicrobial agents, resulting in difficulties in treatment. To gain insight
into the evolution of virulence and antimicrobial resistance traits in S. pneumoniae from the genome
level, we sequenced the entire genome of a serotype 14 isolate (CGSP14), and carried out
comprehensive comparison with other pneumococcal genomes. Multiple serotype 14 clinical
isolates were also genotyped by multilocus sequence typing (MLST).
Results: Comparative genomic analysis revealed that the CGSP14 acquired a number of new genes
by horizontal gene transfer (HGT), most of which were associated with virulence and antimicrobial
resistance and clustered in mobile genetic elements. The most remarkable feature is the acquisition
of two conjugative transposons and one resistance island encoding eight resistance genes. Results
of MLST suggested that the major driving force for the genome evolution is the environmental drug
pressure.
Conclusion: The genome sequence of S. pneumoniae serotype 14 shows a bacterium with rapid
adaptations to its lifecycle in human community. These include a versatile genome content, with a
wide range of mobile elements, and chromosomal rearrangement; the latter re-balanced the
genome after events of HGT.

Background
Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major human respiratory
pathogen that causes a variety of serious infections such as
pneumonia, otitis media, meningitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). It is estimated that each year more
than 1 million deaths are attributed to S. pneumoniae
infection worldwide [1]. Furthermore, since 1990 antimicrobial resistance has been escalating in S. pneumoniae [2],
resulting in difficulties in the treatment of pneumococcal
infections. Antimicrobial resistance of S. pneumoniae is
associated with increasing incidence of invasive pneumococcal diseases in children as well as clinical failures of
antimicrobial treatment [3]. Although the 7-valent conjugate vaccine has been shown highly efficacious in the prevention of invasive diseases caused by vaccine serotypes
[4], the emergence of non-vaccine serotype infections has
occurred [5], bringing new challenges to the prevention of
pneumococcal diseases.
HUS is a rare but severe complication of infectious diseases. The majority of HUS cases are associated with enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli; however, HUS associated
with invasive S. pneumoniae infection has been increasingly reported over the years, always with a high mortality
and long-term morbidity [6]. Among the vaccine-preventable serotypes of S. pneumoniae, serotype 14 is often invasive, as evidenced by its high predilection to cause
necrotizing pneumonia and other devastating complications, including HUS [7,8]. In the pre-vaccine era, serotype 14 was one of the most common serotypes of S.
pneumoniae that caused invasive pneumococcal diseases
worldwide [9-11]. Moreover, serotype 14 often expresses
resistance to a variety of antimicrobial agents, including
penicillin, erythromycin, and ceftriaxone. To date, four
complete genome sequences of S. pneumoniae are available in public database, including two laboratory strains
(TIGR4 and D39), one avirulent strain (R6) and one
multidrug-resistant strain (Spn23F) [12-15]. Furthermore,
a total of twelve draft sequences have been published
recently [16,17]. These pneumococcal genomes provide
us a good opportunity to undertake comprehensive comparative studies on the virulence and antimicrobial resistance mechanisms of this microorganism. We described
here the features of S. pneumoniae serotype 14 genome and
the changes of the genome structure and contents compared with other pneumococcal genomes. The diversity
and dynamics of the distributed genome of S. pneumoniae
serotype 14, especially the mobile genetic elements carrying a number of virulence genes and antimicrobial resistance determinants, are highlighted.

1). The sequence of the genome has been deposited in the
GenBank database (accession no. CP001033). Base pair
one of this chromosome was assigned within the putative
origin of replication. The genome has 58 tRNAs, 12 rRNAs
and 3 structural RNAs, including 4 rRNA operons. Biological roles were assigned to 67% of the 2,206 predicted protein-coding sequences (CDSs), according to the
classification scheme adapted from Riley [18]. Seventynine percent of the coding sequences were transcribed in
the same orientation as DNA replication, a feature that
appears to be common in other low GC Gram-positive
bacteria [15]. The replication termination site is localized
near 1.1 megabase pairs by GC skew analysis. This region
is located almost exactly opposite the origin of replication
on the chromosome (Figure 1). The genome includes 65
pseudogenes, the majority of which are IS elements and
hypothetical proteins.
Previous studies showed that the S. pneumoniae genome is
rich in IS elements, which make up more of the genome
than of any other bacterial genomes sequenced to date
[13,15]. In the CGSP14 genome we identified 80 IS elements (Additional file 1). The majority of the IS elements

appeared to be degenerate due to insertions, deletions, or
point mutations, and only twelve were intact in CGSP14
genome. Although these degenerate IS elements might be
inactive and non-functional, they could provide the
potential sites for homologous recombination to acquire
novel genes from related species.
Comparative genomic analysis
Comparative analysis of CGSP14 genome with four complete genomes and twelve draft pneumococcal genomes
(Table 1) provided new insights into the rapid evolution
of the pneumococcal genome. S. pneumoniae, as with
other bacterial pathogens, possesses a conserved core
genome with interspersing regions of small and large scale
differences (Figure 2). In total, 1,619 orthologous genes
were shared by the seventeen pneumococcal genomes
(Additional file 2). By searching the orthologous genes
against COG database, 36% were found to be metabolism-related, 36% were associated with other known functions, 16% had poorly characterized functions, and 12%
had no hits in the COG database and encoded mainly
hypothetical proteins (Additional file 3). In addition, we
found CGSP14 shared the largest number of orthologous
genes (2055 and 2049 respectively) with strains Spn23F
and SPnINV200 among the sixteen strains used for comparative genomic analysis, indicating that the CGSP14
genome shows highest homology to the two sequenced
strains.

The genes on the distributed genomes were further analyzed. Alignment analysis revealed that at least eight distributed clusters were present in CGSP14 genome; most of
the genes were related to virulence or antimicrobial resistance. These include a lantibiotic synthesis gene cluster, the
capsular locus, a large cell wall surface anchor protein,
two transposons, a resistance island, a possible phage

remnant and a gene cluster with unknown functions.
Meanwhile, we displayed the genome-wide GC content in
Figure 3. All the eight clusters had deviated GC content,
suggesting they could be recent acquisitions through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in CGSP14. The distribution
of the eight gene clusters among the seventeen pneumococcal genomes was shown in Table 2. Particularly, the
two conjugative transposons were found to be unique in
the CGSP14 genome.
Alignment analysis indicated that chromosomal rearrangements occurred in S. pneumoniae (Figure 2). Compared with other published pneumococcal genomes,
chromosomal inversions were identified in CGSP14
genome. A 189-kb inversion occurred across the replication termination site (from 1,010 kb to 1,199 kb). Chromosomal inversion across the replication axis usually is
believed to rebalance the unbalanced chromosomal architecture caused by the insertion of large DNA segments
[19]. In the CGSP14 genome, we found that most of the
acquired-DNA segments (totally 80.5 kb), mainly composed of transposons and IS elements, resided in left of
the replication axis (Figure 1). These observations suggested that the integration of transposons and IS elements
affected the balance of the chromosomal architecture.
This imbalance might cause the chromosomal inversion
in CGSP14. This inversion led to transfer of 25 genes from
the left to the right of the replication axis. Besides, a 19-kb
inversion (from 832 kb to 851 kb) was observed in
CGSP14 relative to TIGR4, G54, and INV200, while the
gene order in this 19-kb segment is consistent to INV200.
The gene cluster is not intact in other pneumococcal
genomes. Further analysis showed that the four rearrangement breakpoints were located within the IS elements.
Through chromosomal rearrangements, S. pneumoniae
evolved to maintain genome stability after HGT that

might confer genes necessary for the organism to survive
or replicate in its environmental niche.
Antimicrobial Resistance genes
CGSP14 is resistant to a variety of antimicrobial agents.
The antimicrobial resistance determinants among the seventeen penumococcal strains were compared and listed in
Additional file 4. CGSP14 contained 18 antimicrobial
resistance determinants, while the number of antimicrobial resistance determinants in other strains varied from 9
to 12. Nearly half of the antimicrobial resistance determinants in CGSP14 were associated with mobile genetic elements.

The genome contained two large conjugative transoposons, which were found as composite elements of the
known transposons. The first one containing 69 open
reading frames (ORFs), was a 68-kb conjugative transposon (Figure 4A). Since this transposon had never been
described previously, we named it Tn2008, a novel conjugative transposon. Sequence analysis indicated that
Tn2008 was a composite of three transposons. A 50-kb
DNA segment carrying chloramphenicol resistance gene
(cat) could be an independent conjugative transposon
and at left terminus of this transposon, two ORFs were
designated as intergrase and relaxase required for transposition. The sequences of the ORFs within this transposon
were highly homologous to those of Tn5252, which have
been reported in S. pneumoniae before [20,21]. The
Tn5252-like transposon was split into a 46-kb proximal
region and a 4-kb distal region after the insertion of a 13kb segment. The insertion appeared in the same position
in Spn23F, which contained a 81-kb conjugative transposon [12]. The 13-kb insertion was identified as another
independent transposon, which also owned the intergrase
and excisionase at the right terminus for independent
transposition; this transposon carried 3 genes coding for
erythromycin, streptothricin and kanamycin resistance, a
feature similar to the known Tn1545 [22]. Another 5-kb
segment, as an insertion in the 13-kb transposon, resembled the transposon Tn917 [23], which contained 3 ORFs,
encoding erythromycin resistance protein (ermB),
resolvase and transposase. Overall, this novel conjugative
transposon, a composite of three transposons, carried 5
antimicrobial resistance genes.
The other 23-kb conjugative transposon in CGSP14 contained 23 ORFs (Figure 4C). Sequence analysis demonstrated that this transposon was also a composite of two
transposons. An 18-kb DNA segment carrying a tetracycline resistance gene (tetM) could be an independent
transposon, which contained two ORFs encoding for
intergrase and excisase; this transposon shows high similarity to the transposon Tn916 (Figure 4C) [24]. Another
5-kb segment carrying an erythromycin resistance gene
(ermB), as an insertion, was identified as Tn917-like transposon. The structure of this composite transposon, i.e., a

Tn917-like transposon inserted by a Tn916 transposon,
resembled that of Tn3872. The structure of Tn3872 has
been described in S. pneumoniae [25]; thus, this 23-kb conjugative transposon was defined as a Tn3872-like transposon.
Among the seventeen published S. pneumoniae genomes,
an 81-kb conjugative transposon and a 67-kb conjugative
transposon also appeared in the genomes of Spn23F and
G54, respectively. The two conjugative transposons were
both composed of a Tn916-like transposon and a Tn5252like transposon [12,16], similar to Tn2008 in CGSP14.
However, comparative analysis suggested that genetic variations occured among the three conjugative transposons
(Figure 4B). In CGSP14 and Spn23F, the Tn5252-like
transposons carry a chloramphenicol resistance gene,
which seems missing in G54, and is replaced by an ABCtype antimicrobial peptide transport system. The Tn916like transposon in Spn23F carries a tetracycline resistance
gene, and in G54, it carries a tetracycline resistance gene
and an erythromycin resistance gene. In contrast, the
Tn916-like element of Tn2008 in CGSP14 lost the locus
encoding the tetracycline resistance gene, while a DNA
segment encoding three antimicrobial resistance genes, a
transcriptional repressor and a Tn917-like transposon was
inserted into this position. The variation of antimicrobial
resistance determinants in the three conjugative transposons showed that the conjugative transposons have
experienced frequent recombination and deletion events
after the Tn916-like element integrated into the larger

In addition to the two conjugative transposons carrying
antimicrobial resistance genes, we identified a 14.4-kb
genomic region (Figure 5), which appeared to be a resistance island in CGSP14. The 14.4-kb region carried a chloramphenicol resistance gene (cat) and a gene encoding
methionyl-tRNA synthetase 2 (metS2). Further analysis
showed that the island shared an average G+C content of
33.6%, much lower than the average of the genome
(39.5%). This island contained several genes associated
with genome instability, including one site-specific
recombinase and multiple IS elements which might be
responsible for the lateral transfer of the genomic region.
Furthermore, the associated ORFs had diverse phylogenetic origin (data not shown). Based on these features, we
deemed the 14.4-kb region as a resistance island; to our
knowledge, this was for the first time described in S. pneumoniae. This 14.4-kb resistance island was also seen in the
draft genomes of CGSSp14BS69, CGSSp19BS75,
CGSSp9BS68 and SPnINV200. BLAST results showed that
the sequences in this island showed high identity to each
other. The comparison between CGSP14 and SPnINV200
was demonstrated in Figure 4. Since this island carried
two antimicrobial resistance genes, the presence of this
resistance island may be associated with the increased
multidrug resistance of these strains.
Distinct from the characterized antimicrobial resistance
determinants associated with mobile genetic elements in
CGSP14, there were several chromosome-encoded determinants that also contributed to antimicrobial resistance.
These included a tellurite resistance protein (tehB), a bacitracin resistance protein (bacA), a cadmium resistance
transporter (cadD), a multidrug resistance efflux pump
(mdtG), two β-lactam resistance factors (femAB), and three
metallo-β-lactamases.
Penicillin-binding proteins
Penicillin-resistant pneumococci are prevalent throughout the world. One mechanism conferring penicillin nonsusceptibility is alterations of penicillin-binding proteins
(PBP). Alterations in PBP genes result in reduced affinity
for penicillin and other β-lactams. Five high-molecularweight PBP genes (pbp1a, pbp1b, pbp2a, pbp2b, pbp2x) dispersed in S. pneumoniae. Among the five genes, highly variable pbp2x, pbp1a, and pbp2b are considered most
important in antimicrobial resistance [26]. By allele
assignments of the three PBP genes in the seventeen penumococcal genomes, CGSP14 had the most variable pbp2x,
pbp1a, and pbp2b. Although the sequence variations of
these PBP genes in CGSP14 differed from two other
strains of serotype 14 (SPnINV200 and SP14-BS69), they

were almost identical to those of the strain Spn23F, suggesting that pbp2x, pbp1a, and pbp2b genes probably had
gone through frequent homologous recombination
between serotypes 14 and 23F.
Virulence genes
The polysaccharide capsule is the principal pneumococcal
virulence determinant. S. pneumoniae are divided into 91
serotypes depending on different capsular structures.
Studies suggested that certain serotypes have a greater
potential to cause invasive disease than others [27,28].
The clinical isolates of S. pneumoniae in Asia are largely
confined to a limited number of serotypes, namely 6B, 9V,
14, 19F, and 23F [29]. In CGSP14 genome, a 19.4-kb gene
cluster (SPCG0345 to SPCG0363) was identified to be
involved in the synthesis of the capsular polysaccharide,
flanked by two IS elements on each side, either truncated
or disrupted, which were remnants of IS1202 and IS1167,
respectively. Compared to strain 34359 of serotype 14
and strain SPnINV200 for which the capsular locus was
determined [30], the capsular locus of CGSP14 differed at
3' end (Additional file 5). The gene wciY was divided into
two orfs (SPCG0358 and SPCG0359) in CGSP14. This
gene was unique in serotype 14, but its function was
unknown. However, a previous study showed that the disruption of this gene did not affect capsular production
[31]. Besides, the orf (SPCG0360) immediately downstream of these two genes in CGSP14 was found to contain a deletion of 5 units of a 306-bp tandem repeat,
compared with the corresponding genes in strain 34359
and SPnINV200. The gene belonged to the surface
anchored protein family but its function also remained

unclear. With the exception of these two genes, other
genes in the capsular locus were almost identical among
the three strains of serotype 14 [30]. As has been described
[30], serotype 14 utilized the Wzx/Wzy-dependent pathway to synthesize their capsular polysaccharide (Additional file 6).
In addition to the capsule, S. pneumoniae produced a
number of other virulence factors, such as pneumolysin,
hydrogen peroxide and cell surface proteins [32]. According to how they are linked to the cell surface, the surface
proteins of S. pneumoniae are divided into three families:
choline-binding proteins, LPXTG-anchored proteins, and
lipoproteins [32]. Surface proteins of CGSP14 based on
computer prediction are shown in Additional file 7.
Several members of the choline-binding protein family
are known to be important for virulence, including the
autolysin (lytA), choline binding protein A (pspC), and
pneumococcal surface protein A (pspA). PspC is involved
in the adhesion of bacteria to the nasopharynx [33]. PspA
is a highly variable protein and involved in inhibition of
complement activation [32]. Choline binding protein
PcpA is postulated to be an adhesin because it contains
leucine-rich repeats [34]. The seventeen penumococcal
genomes all harbored one copy of these virulence determinants, while CGSP14 and SP19-BS75 both obtained
another copy of pspA and pcpA due to a 7-kb-long DNA
insertion adjacent to a remnant transposase. The 7 kb
sequences in CGSP14 and SP19-BS75 showed high identity to each other.

Proteins that contain the LPXTG amino acid motif are
common in most Gram-positive bacteria. The LPXTG
motif near to the carboxyl terminal of the protein is recognized and linked to the cell wall by a sortase enzyme [32].
Neuraminidase is one of the LPXTG-anchored proteins.
Neuraminidase cleaves N-acetylneuraminic acid from oligosaccharides, glycoproteins, glycolipids and is viewed as
a virulence factor in microbial pathogenesis [32]. Analysis
of the available genome sequences of S. pneumoniae indicated that this microorganism had at least three neuraminidases [13-15]. All the three neuraminidases are present
in CGSP14. Both nanA and nanB are present in all the
other sixteen penumococcal strains, while nanC is present
only in eight. The presence of nanC might be associated
with the increased virulence of some strains of S. pneumoniae. Zinc metalloprotease is also a member of LPXTGanchored protein family. From the published genome
sequences of S. pneumoniae, four zinc metalloproteases
were discovered. CGSP14 contained three of them,
including iga, zmpB and zmpD. Zinc metalloproteinases
belong to a group of hypervariable surface proteins, the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/158

hypervariability of these proteins are due to frequent HGT
in these regions, enabling antigenic escape [35].
Besides these common virulence proteins, one unusual
protein in LPXTG-anchored proteins family was found.
The gene, SPCG1750, encoded a 4695-animo acid protein, containing 528 imperfect repeats of the amino acid
motif SASASAST. This surface protein shows homology to
SP1772 (4776-animo acid) in TIGR4. The surface protein
is located in the vicinity of nine glycosyl transferases in
CGSP14, all of which are present on a 40.5-kb segment
flanked by two IS elements. The 40.5-kb region seems to
be an insertion in CGSP14 and TIGR4 due to HGT, as this
region has not been found in other genomes.
Lantibiotics are peptide antibiotics with high antimicrobial activity against several Gram-positive bacteria. They
are ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified [36]. In CGSP14, we identified a 5.4-kb locus encoding three proteins related to lantibiotic biosynthesis: a
lantibiotic dehydratase, a lantibiotic synthetase and a lan-

tibiotic efflux protein, nearby a transcriptional regulator
(Figure 6). By a thorough search against other sixteen
genomes, this gene cluster shows high similarity to the
corresponding locus in the genome of another serotype
14 strain SPnINV200. Recent studies reported that the
strains SP23-BS72 and Spn23F of serotype 23 also contained lantibiotic synthesis gene clusters [12,37]; however, comparative analysis indicated that they showed no
sequence similarity to those found in CGSP14 and
SPnINV200. Furthermore, we performed a BLAST search
against the nr database, and found the locus in the
serotype14 has a high similarity (70%–88% identity) to
that in Streptococcus thermophilus. Therefore, this locus in
the serotype 14 might encode a new type of lantibiotic,
different from those found in the serotype 23. This finding
suggests that communication of virulence genes has
occurred among different species of Streptococci.
What drives the genome evolution?
In this study, we further analyzed 20 clinical isolates of S.
pneumoniae serotype 14, all from sterile sites, by multilocus sequence typing (MLST), in addition to CGSP14,
which belonged to ST15. The most common sequence
type was ST876 (7 isolates), followed by ST13 (5) and
ST46 (5) (Table 2). Only one ST15 was identified among
the 20 isolates. ST876 and ST46 were prevalent in Taiwan,
while both ST13 and ST15 belonged to variants of the
international England14 clone (ST9). Capsular switching
could have occurred between serotypes 14 and 3 and

between serotype 14 and serogroup 9, as we found two
isolates (Bsp097 and Bsp098) were ST1569. ST1569 has
been identified in serotypes 3, 9A, and 9V. All the clinical
serotype 14 isolates, expressed different levels of penicillin and ceftriaxone nonsusceptibility (Table 3), which is
in accord with the data published recently [38]. This finding indicates that higher competence and plasticity of the
genome likely afforded an advantage to pneumococcal
strains to become more and more antimicrobial-resistant,
and again supports that virulent clones might evolve to be
more resistant in order to survive in the drug environment. Given the fact, to reduce the selective pressure, judicious use of antibiotics should never be overemphasized.

Discussion
A bacterial pathogen can be described by its "supragenome", which is composed of a "core genome" and an "distributed genome" [39-41]. In general, the core genome
includes all genes responsible for the basic aspects of the
biology of a species and its major phenotypic traits. In
contrast, distributed genomes constitute to the species
diversity and might encode supplementary biochemical
pathways and functions not essential for bacterial growth
but which confer selective advantages, such as adaptation
to different niches and antimicrobial resistance. In this
study, we added a complete genome to the pneumococcal
supragenome. The analysis of distributed genome of
CGSP14 indicates that pneumococcal supragenome is still
open and evolving.

Comparative analysis showed that gene communications
occurred frequently among different strains of S. pneumoniae and among different species of the streptococcus
genus by HGT, which has been demonstrated as a major
force to drive bacterial evolution [42,43]. S. pneumoniae is
able to efficiently acquire genetic materials from the large
gene pool of the environment by means of transformation, transduction, and conjugation. We found that at the
genome level, CGSP14 acquired at least eight foreign
DNA elements from other organisms by HGT, as these
blocks demonstrated deviation in the GC content. In
sequence analysis, the genes encoded in these newly
acquired elements may enhance the pathogenicity and
antimicrobial resistance of CGSP14.
In CGSP14 genome, a remarkable feature is horizontal
acquisition of two conjugative transposons and one
genomic island. The three previously un-described mobile
elements totally carried eight antimicrobial resistance
genes, which promote the adaptation of organism to an
environment with high drug pressure. Besides, most of the
other accessory DNA elements were flanked by IS elements; for instance, the capsular locus, the predominant
virulence determinant of S. pneumoniae, was a mobile
genetic element flanked by IS elements. The dynamics of
these mobile elements might attribute to the clinically
important phenotypic shift in S. pneumonae.
Invasive pneumococcal disease cases due to serotypes
included in the 7-valent vaccine continued to fall in the
USA, but the overall invasive pneumococcal disease rate
leveled off starting in 2002, largely due to an increase in
cases caused by serotype 19A, which is not covered by the
7-valent vaccine [44]. Given these trends, development of
expanded-valency polysaccharide vaccines or ideally, a
universal protein vaccine, is mandatory. It has been
shown that in the case of S. agalactiae, the design of such
vaccine was only possible using virulence-related dispensable genes [44]. To this end, sequencing of multiple
genomes from S. pneumoniae to better probe the diversity
of the pathogen and its pathogenic features is necessary
and certainly will continue to surprise us with fascinating
discoveries in the evolution of S. pneumoniae and impact
on the clinical medicine.

comparison with other pneumococcal genomes. We
found that the genome evolution of S. pneumoniae is
driven largely by the host adaptations. In addition to horizontal gene transfer, recombination, which re-balanced
the genome structure after events of gene loss or addition,
also appears to be an important element in S. pneumoniae
evolution. Human intervention in the form of mass vaccination and antimicrobial treatment reduced the burden of
pneumococcal diseases, but has already accelerated the
evolution of the pneumococcal genome. We conclude
that such evolution results in a more virulent and antimicrobial-resistant S. pneumoniae serotype 14.

Methods
Bacterial strains
Twenty-one S. pneumoniae serotype 14 isolates, including
the sequenced CGSP14, were collected from patients with
bacteremic pneumonia treated in Chang Gung Memorial
Hospital and Children's Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan
between 2004 and 2005. Serotyping was carried out by
the quellung reaction with antisera from the Statens
Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark and verified by
sequential multiplex PCR [45]. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by the E test (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden). CGSP14 is a serotype 14 clinical
isolate derived from a child with necrotizing pneumonia,
simultaneously complicated with HUS. The MICs of antimicrobial agents to CGSP14 are penicillin, 2 μg/mL,
erythromycin, 256 μg/mL, and ceftriaxone, 1 μg/mL.
Multilocus sequence typing (MLST)
The nucleotide sequences of 450-bp internal regions from
the aroE, ddl, gdh, gki, recP, spi, and xpt genes were amplified by PCR using the primers described previously [46].
The gene fragments were sequenced on both strands, by
using the same primers, on an ABI 3730 automated
sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA). The
sequences were then compared with those of the recognized alleles of each gene listed in the pneumococcal
MLST website database http://spneumoniae.mlst.net by
using BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor. The web database http://www.mlst.net was used for assigning allele
numbers for particular loci and the sequence type (ST) of
each isolate was defined on the basis of the resulting
allelic profiles.

Conclusion
Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 14 is one of the most
invasive among > 90 pneumococcal serotypes, often causing life-threatening invasive pneumococcal diseases in
humans. S. pneumoniae has been evolving rapidly over
time, resulting in a large amount of genetic diversity,
despite the constraints imposed by the small genome size
and complex genetic organization of the genome. In this
study, we sequenced the entire genome of a serotype 14
clinical isolate (CGSP14), and carried out comprehensive

Whole genome sequencing
The whole genome of S. pneumoniae CGSP14 was
sequenced by using the random shotgun method. Three
genomic libraries (1.5~2-kb inserts, 2~3-kb inserts and 4kb inserts) were constructed from randomly sheared
genomic DNA. Random clones were sequenced using ETDye terminator chemistry, analyzed with an ABI 3700
sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA) and a
MegaBACE 1000 sequencer (Amersham Biosciences, Swe-

den). DNA sequences were analyzed and assembled using
PHRED, PHRAP, and CONSED [47-49]. Gaps in the
sequence were closed either by sequencing through
primer-walking the plasmid templates or by direct
sequencing of combinatorial PCR products. The completed genome contained 34,888 reads with an average
length of 501 bp, resulting in 8-fold sequence coverage.
The complete genome sequence of CGSP14 has been
deposited in the GenBank database with the accession
number CP001033.
Genome annotation
Open reading frames (ORFs) were predicted by GLIMMER
with the default parameters [50]. Putative ORFs shorter
than 30 amino acids were eliminated and ORFs that overlapped were visually inspected, and removed as needed.
The predicted ORFs were reviewed to define start codons
on the basis of ribosomal-binding motifs and homologies. ORFs were further searched against the non-redundant protein database using BLAST [50]. Functional
domains of putative proteins were identified by searching
against Prosite, Blocks, and Pfam database http://
pfam.sanger.ac.uk/. Functional categories were assigned
by searching all predicted proteins against COG database
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG. Transfer RNA genes
(tRNAs) were identified using tRNAscan-SE [51], ribosomal RNA genes (rRNAs) and other structural RNAs were
identified from BLAST similarity searches.
Comparative genomic analysis
Twelve penumococcal genome sequences and the proteincoding sequences per strain (R6: AE007317; D39:
CP000410; TIGR4: AE005672; G54: CP001015; SP3BS71: AAZZ00000000; SP6-BS73: ABAA00000000; SP9BS68: ABAB00000000; SP11-BS70: ABAC00000000;
SP14-BS69: ABAD00000000; SP18-BS74: ABA E00 0000
00; SP19-BS75: ABAF00000000 and SP23-BS72: AB AG
00000000) were obtained through the web site of NCBI
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. The remaining four
genome sequences (Spn23F, SPnINV104B, SPnINV200,
and SPnOXC141) were obtained through the web site of
Sanger Institute http://www.sanger.ac.uk/, and the ORFs
per strain were predicted by GLIMMER and annotated by
searching against the nr database using BLAST. Each pair
of the predicted ORFs among the seventeen penumococcal strains were aligned using BLASTP (E value < 10-5 and
protein similarity > 40%). The outputs were parsed by perl
scripts written by ourselves to extract the orthologous
genes shared among the seventeen penumococcal
genomes. Alignment of the genomes of the five completely sequenced strains was accomplished with the
MUMmer program [52]. ACT (Artemis Comparison Tool)
was used to enable the visualization of BLAST comparisons between the genomes [53]. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of each orthologous gene was
accomplished using CLUSTALW [54].
