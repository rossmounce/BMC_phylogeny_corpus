Evolutionary analysis of the kinesin light chain
genes in the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti:
gene duplication as a source for novel early zygotic
genes
Research article

Abstract
Background: The maternal zygotic transition marks the time at which transcription from the zygotic genome is
initiated and a subset of maternal RNAs are progressively degraded in the developing embryo. A number of early
zygotic genes have been identified in Drosophila melanogaster and comparisons to sequenced mosquito genomes
suggest that some of these early zygotic genes such as bottleneck are fast-evolving or subject to turnover in dipteran
insects. One objective of this study is to identify early zygotic genes from the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti to
study their evolution. We are also interested in obtaining early zygotic promoters that will direct transgene expression
in the early embryo as part of a Medea gene drive system.
Results: Two novel early zygotic kinesin light chain genes we call AaKLC2.1 and AaKLC2.2 were identified by
transcriptome sequencing of Aedes aegypti embryos at various time points. These two genes have 98% nucleotide and
amino acid identity in their coding regions and show transcription confined to the early zygotic stage according to
gene-specific RT-PCR analysis. These AaKLC2 genes have a paralogous gene (AaKLC1) in Ae. aegypti. Phylogenetic
inference shows that an ortholog to the AaKLC2 genes is only found in the sequenced genome of Culex
quinquefasciatus. In contrast, AaKLC1 gene orthologs are found in all three sequenced mosquito species including
Anopheles gambiae. There is only one KLC gene in D. melanogaster and other sequenced holometabolous insects that
appears to be similar to AaKLC1. Unlike AaKLC2, AaKLC1 is expressed in all life stages and tissues tested, which is
consistent with the expression pattern of the An. gambiae and D. melanogaster KLC genes. Phylogenetic inference also
suggests that AaKLC2 genes and their likely C. quinquefasciatus ortholog are fast-evolving genes relative to the highly
conserved AaKLC1-like paralogs. Embryonic injection of a luciferase reporter under the control of a 1 kb fragment
upstream of the AaKLC2.1 start codon shows promoter activity at least as early as 3 hours in the developing Ae. aegypti
embryo. The AaKLC2.1 promoter activity reached ~1600 fold over the negative control at 5 hr after egg deposition.
Conclusions: Transcriptome profiling by use of high throughput sequencing technologies has proven to be a valuable
method for the identification and discovery of early and transient zygotic genes. The evolutionary investigation of the
KLC gene family reveals that duplication is a source for the evolution of new genes that play a role in the dynamic
process of early embryonic development. AaKLC2.1 may provide a promoter for early zygotic-specific transgene
expression, which is a key component of the Medea gene drive system.

ment have been maternally deposited during oogenesis.
The onset of zygotic transcription marks the beginning of
the maternal-zygotic transition (MZT) whereby maternal
RNAs are progressively degraded and zygotic transcription takes over, providing the necessary gene products for
development [1-4]. Recent large-scale studies have tried
to determine what genes or groups of genes are expressed

during Drosophila development [1,2]. At least some of
the early zygotic genes such as bottleneck [5] are fastevolving or subject to turnover in dipteran insects
because a homolog of the Drosophila bottleneck is not
found in any of the sequenced mosquito genomes. To
study the evolution of early zygotic genes through comparative analysis, we set out to identify early zygotic
genes in the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti by transcriptome profiling, taking advantage of large-scale Illumina sequencing. We have determined the MZT starting
in Ae. aegypti within 2-3 hr after egg deposition, based on
Illumina transcriptome profiling and RT-PCR. This time
is just before or at the beginning of pole cell formation at
3 hr [6]. Early zygotic transcription at this time is developmentally consistent with reports from Drosophila that
indicate transcription starting as early as cycle 8 [7], also
just before the onset of pole cell formation. We focused
on the purely zygotic genes that do not have a maternal
contribution. Thus, we were searching for transcripts that
were not present in the embryos 0-2 hr after egg deposition but started to appear 2-4 hr after egg deposition.
One of the early and pure zygotic genes identified was a
kinesin light chain (KLC) gene that is the focus of this
study. The three classes of cytoskeleton molecular motors
include kinesin, dynein, and myosin, with kinesin and
dynein using microtubules as a track for transport and
myosin depending on actin filaments [8]. Kinesins are a
diverse family of proteins as demonstrated by phylogenies
based on the heavy chain [9,10] and are involved in a variety of cellular transport roles [11]. The conventional kinesin (kinesin-I) is a heterotetramer having two kinesin
heavy chains characterized by ATPase-dependent motor
activity and two kinesin light chains (KLCs). KLCs are
accessory proteins that have a C-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain comprising approximately 34
residues that binds cargo for transport [11]. Here we
report the discovery of two novel embryonic-specific
KLC genes we call AaKLC2 in Aedes aegypti (Ae. aegypti)
and their likely ortholog in C. quinquefasciatus. We analyze these genes in comparison to other KLC genes in
diverse organisms and suggest gene duplication as a
source for the purely zygotic AaKLC2 genes, which are
fast-evolving.
Another goal of this research was related to efforts to
develop a gene drive system for mosquitoes, which may
be used to spread pathogen-resistant genes into mosquito
populations to control mosquito-borne infectious disease. A natural gene drive system comprised of maternal
effect dominant embryonic arrest (Medea) factors was
first discovered in the flour beetle T. castaneum [12]. In
this system, Medea is comprised of a maternally
expressed toxin that is passed on to all embryos of a
Medea-bearing female, and a tightly linked zygotically
expressed antidote that is only made in Medea-bearing

Page 2 of 9

embryos. As a result, only Medea-bearing offspring of a
Medea-bearing female will survive, which leads to the fixation of the Medea allele in the population. Chen et al.
2007 successfully engineered and demonstrated a Medea
system in D. melanogaster that employs the use of maternal-specific and zygotic-specific promoters to drive
expression of toxin and antidote genes, respectively [13].
Developing a Medea system in mosquitoes requires the
identification of early zygotic genes in the mosquito species of interest due to the difficulty of finding orthologs to
D. melanogaster zygotic genes as mentioned above. We
identified the zygotic-specific AaKLC2.1 and demonstrated strong promoter activity of its upstream sequence
in Ae. aegypti early embryos.

Results
Identification of two early zygotic kinesin light chain genes
AaKLC2.1 and AaKLC2.2

We looked at expression from Ae. aegypti Liverpool strain
embryos at 4 time ranges of 0-2, 2-4, 4-8, and 8-12 hr.
Over 16,000 Ae. aegypti annotated transcripts (vectorbase.org) were used in BLAST [14] vs. sequences
obtained from Illumina. Of particular interest for the discovery of pure early zygotic genes were the transcripts
having no hits in the 0-2 hr (presence indicates a maternal transcript), and hits present at 2-4 hr. Several transcripts were identified with these criteria, including two
KLC genes AaKLC2.1 (AAEL011410-RA) and its paralog
AaKLC2.2 (AAEL014967-RA). The nomenclature here
does not correspond to mammalian KLC nomenclature
because the focus is on insect KLC genes. AaKLC2.1 and
AaKLC2.2 are 98% identical to each other in their coding
regions and it was possible to design gene-specific primers to independently confirm their expression profiles by
RT-PCR as described later. Shown in Table 1 is the Illumina result of three KLC genes in this study, one of which
is not purely zygotic, but ubiquitously expressed
(AAEL012472, see below).
Structural and genomic analysis of AaKLC2 and other KLC
genes

Structural analysis supports the categorization of two
KLC gene groups, the AaKLC1-like and the AaKLC2-like
genes (Figure 1). AaKLC2.1 is an intronless gene with a
predicted open reading frame (ORF) of 1419 nucleotides
(nt). AaKLC2.2 is also intronless and has 98% nt and aa
identity to AaKLC2.1 in its coding region. The lack of
introns in the AaKLC2-like genes is notable since it has
been reported that 70% of Drosophila early zygotic genes
do not have introns presumably for increased efficiency
of transcription with fast-cycling nuclei [1]. A likely
ortholog of the AaKLC2 genes was identified in C. quinquefasciatus, which is an intronless gene having a similar
ORF length (gene ID: CPIJ002971). However, no similar

Notes: 0-2, 2-4, 4-8, and 8-12 hr indicate time ranges from which RNA was isolated from developing Ae. aegypti embryos. Raw values of the
three transcripts in the four samples (number of hits from BLAST using an E-value cutoff of 1e-7) are given at left. Normalized values (in
parentheses) are calculated as the raw values divided by the transcript (CDS) length, then divided by the total number of reads matching all
annotated mRNA transcripts from each sample, and multiplied by 1e10. The total number of reads matching all annotated mRNA transcripts
from each sample time point was: 0-2 hr (2087707); 2-4 hr (4810435); 4-8 hr (3920821); 8-12 hr (1767898). See Additional File 1 for a summary

genes were found in the genome sequences of An. gambiae [15], An. stephensi (8× coverage genome assembly,
Tu unpublished), D. melanogaster, or other insects. Thus
from genome analysis, it appears that AaKLC2-like genes
are restricted to mosquitoes of the subfamily Culicinae.
The expression of the C. quinquefasciatus gene will need
to be verified by RT-PCR or other methods to determine
if it is indeed an early and transient zygotic gene. This is
why we have not called it CqKLC2.
Unlike the AaKLC2-like genes, AaKLC1-like genes have
longer ORFs and at least one intron (Figure 1, right column). Interestingly, these AaKLC1-like genes have conservation of intron position in some cases. For example, 4
introns have conserved positions between Ae. aegypti and
An. gambiae, and one intron position is conserved in Ae.
aegypti, An. gambiae, and D. melanogaster. In addition,

one intron position and length is conserved between Ae.
aegypti and D. melanogaster.
All of the KLC genes have tetratricopeptide repeat
(TPR) and Rab5-binding domains as determined by the
Conserved Domain Database (CDD) v2.17 at the
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
website at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ (Figure 1). Rab5
is a small GTPase that regulates early endosome fusion
[16,17]. The Rab-5 binding and TPR domains detected in
the 472 aa sequence of AaKLC2.1 have E-values of 1e-26
and 3e-3, respectively. It is interesting to note that there is
a partial gene duplication (gene ID: AAEL005502, see
Figure 2) of AaKLC1 that contains only the Rab5 binding
domain and has 100% nt identity to AaKLC1 throughout
729 of the 741 bases of the AAEL005502 ORF (differences
are only found in the last 12 bases). The 246 aa conceptual translation of AAEL005502 only has 2 aa different
than AaKLC1.
Phylogenetic inference of KLC genes demonstrates a
diverse evolutionary history

Published kinesin phylogenies have focused on the kinesin heavy chain. Here we present a KLC phylogeny
including representatives from mosquito, fly, wasp, honeybee, worm, fish, frog, sea urchin, squid, monkey, cow,
chicken, mouse, rat, human, and bacteria (Figure 2). Like
kinesin heavy chain phylogeny, KLC phylogeny is also
rather diverse having many paralogous groups, with most
of the diversity existing in mammals. For example,
humans have 4 paralogous KLC genes. In contrast, the
holometabolous insects surveyed have 1 KLC gene in
common that includes AaKLC1 in Ae. aegypti. The
AaKLC2 genes that are zygotic-specific (see below) and
their likely ortholog in C. quinquefasciatus appear to be
restricted to species of Culicinae because similar
sequences could not be detected in the genome
sequences of the mosquito An. gambiae or other insects.

performed using MrBayes v3.1.2 with aa sequences conceptually translated from kinesin light chain genes of mosquitoes, other holometabolous insects, and divergent taxa. Clade credibility values are shown at
each node only when they are not equal to 1.0. Accession numbers are
given for mosquito sequences. Letters after species names indicate
multiple KLC sequences for a species and are not associated with KLC
nomenclature. See Additional File 3 for sequences and accession numbers, and Additional File 4 for alignment in FASTA format. Tree is rooted
using kinesin light chain sequences from two bacterial species. Shaded
sequences designate zygotic (AaKLC2.1 and AaKLC2.2) and potential
zygotic (C. quinquefasciatus CPIJ00CP2971) genes. Bold letters highlight Ae. aegypti KLC genes. Scale shows number of aa changes per site.
An. stephensi KLC1 is not included because we did not have the genome sequence at the time of phylogeny construction. AAEL005502 is
not labeled AaKLC1.2 because this gene is a partial duplication of
AaKLC1 and has only the Rab5-binding domain (see text).

as reciprocal best hits by blastp. However, the structural
and phylogenetic inference supports their grouping (the
clade credibility value is 0.99 for the node at the divergence of KLC1-like and KLC2-like clades). Genomic survey of more species will be needed to elucidate this
matter.
Expression analysis indicates that AaKLC2 genes are
transiently expressed in the early zygotic stage while
AaKLC1 is ubiquitously expressed

The first indication of AaKLC2.1 and AaKLC2.2 as early
and transiently expressed zygotic genes came from
embryonic transcriptome profiling (see above, Table 1).
Transcripts were absent in the 0-2 hr sample and had no
hits in the 8-12 hr sample (AaKLC2.2 had one hit), but
hits were present in both 2-4 and 4-8 hr samples. This
profile was validated by RT-PCR using 1 hr time intervals
from 0-11 hr embryos (Figure 3, only AaKLC2.1 is
shown). Furthermore, RT-PCR with RNA from other tissues and life stages shows that their expression is
restricted to the early embryo. Transcription begins as
early as 2-3 hr and only a faint band can be detected at 67 hr, with the large majority of intensity found during the
3-5 hr time range. AaKLC2.2 has an almost identical
expression profile to AaKLC2.1 according to RT-PCR
(not shown). RT-PCR products were cloned, sequenced,
and verified to be specific for each transcript. These data
support that AaKLC2 genes are early zygotic transiently
expressed genes whose expression is restricted to the

Interestingly, the AaKLC2 genes and the C. quinquefasciatus AaKLC2-like gene are fast-evolving genes relative
to the highly conserved AaKLC1-like genes. Shown are
the only KLC genes detected in insects resulting from
BLAST searches using divergent KLC genes from the
phylogeny as queries.
The phylogeny indicates that the AaKLC2-like genes
arose prior to the divergence of Ae. aegypti and An. gambiae lineages, suggesting an event that predates the divergence of Culicinae and Anophelinae. This is perplexing
because AaKLC2-like genes are not detected in Anopheline mosquitoes An. gambiae and An. stephensi, which
suggests that AaKLC2-like genes arose within Culicinae
after Culicinae/Anophelinae divergence and prior to the
divergence of Aedes and Culex genera. Also curious is
that Ae. aegypti AAEL11410 and C. quinquefasciatus
CPIJ002971 KLC aa sequences do not obtain each other

early embryonic life stage. In contrast, AaKLC1 is
expressed in all developmental stages and tissues surveyed by RT-PCR. It also has significant presence in the
0-2 and 8-12 hr Illumina sample (Table 1).
Expression data from ESTs and microarray experiments
for KLC genes is consistent with the hypothesis that
AaKLC2-like genes (Figure 1, left) are zygotic-specific
genes and AaKLC1-like genes (Figure 1, right) are ubiquitously expressed genes (Table 2). Using BLAST by NCBI,
EST hits for various life stages are detected for the
AaKLC1-like genes in Table 2, and for the other holometabolous insects in Figure 2 (not shown). However, no
EST hits for AaKLC2-like genes are detected. This is most
likely simply explained by the lack of EST data from
embryos. Microarray experiments covering developmental time periods for An. gambiae reveal expression for the
AaKLC1-like but not for AaKLC2-like genes. These data
further support the existence of two distinct types of KLC
genes.
Early zygotic promoter activity of AaKLC2.1 upstream
sequence in Ae. aegypti embryos

The 1 kb upstream sequence relative to the predicted
start codon of AaKLC2.1 was synthesized (Epoch Biolabs,
INC) to test for promoter activity. This sequence was
cloned into the pGL3-basic luciferase reporter vector,
injected into Ae. aegypti embryos, and assayed for
luciferase activity. AaKLC2.1 upstream sequence clearly
demonstrates promoter activity, as the mean fold activity
of AaKLC2.1_pGL3-basic is 1604X greater than the
empty vector alone (Figure 4). The 1 kb upstream
sequence for AaKLC2.2 was also tested and it demonstrated similar activity (not shown). Several independent
experiments have demonstrated the activity of these
sequences and we are now working towards defining the

Page 5 of 9

minimal promoter sequence. The transcription profile of
AaKLC2.1 is solely zygotic (Figure 3A) and the reporter
assay clearly indicates early zygotic activity of the
AaKLC2.1 promoter. However, the transient assay
described here does not directly test whether the promoter is solely zygotic. Transgenic lines of Ae. aegypti are
needed to directly answer such a question.

Discussion
A novel set of purely zygotic genes: duplications, fast
evolution, and possible function

AaKLC2-like genes are only found in Culicinae mosquitoes Ae. aegypti and C. quinquefasciatus. However the
AaKLC1-like genes are found in all surveyed holometabolous insects and are quite conserved in their structure
and expression profiles. Thus it is likely that AaKLC2
genes are the paralogs that took on a new expression profile and possibly a new function in Culicinae. It is also
interesting that in addition to the duplication that gave
rise to the AaKLC2 gene lineage, there has been another
duplication resulting in AaKLC2.1 and AaKLC2.2.
The AaKLC2-like genes appear to be fast-evolving
genes according to their branch length (Figure 2). For
example, AaKLC2.1 and the C. quinquefasciatus
AaKLC2-like gene (CPIJ002971) have 44% aa identity,
while AaKLC1 and the C. quinquefasciatus AaKLC1-like
gene (CPIJ015771) have 94% aa identity. A curious question is whether AaKLC2-like genes have been under positive selection. However, we were unable to perform
nonsynonymous/synonymous (dN/dS) analysis due to
the divergence of the AaKLC2 and the C. quinquefasciatus CPIJ002971.
The presence of at least one highly conserved KLC gene
(e.g. AaKLC1-like) in all of insects is not surprising given
its indispensable role in intracellular transport, but it is

group.

Figure 4 Early zygotic promoter activity of AaKLC2.1 upstream
sequence in Ae. aegypti embryos. Embryos were injected in triplicate with either one of the following firefly luciferase reporter plasmids:
pGL3-basic only (negative control, shown as pGL3) or pGL3-basic containing 1042 bp of AaKLC2.1 5'UTR and upstream sequence. A Renilla
luciferase reporter pRL-null containing D. melanogaster actin 5C promoter was used as an injection control. Embryos were homogenized
and assayed at 5 hr after deposition. Mean fold relative light units
(RLUs) +/- standard error is shown. The mean fold RLU is calculated as
the ratio of the firefly luciferase activity to the Renilla luciferase activity.
The mean fold activity of AaKLC2.1 was 1604 times greater than pGL3basic.

interesting why a novel zygotic-specific KLC arose in
Culicinae. The genome sizes of Ae. aegypti and C. quinquefasciatus are approximately three and two times larger
than An. gambiae [18] possibly providing more evolutionary freedom for gene expansion early in Culicinae. A
large proportion of Drosophila early and transient zygotic
genes were found to be involved in neurogenesis and
dorso-ventral patterning [2]. Also noteworthy is that a
KLC gene has been implicated in translocation of dorsal
determinants in Xenopus [19]. Although we do not have
experimental evidence of AaKLC2 function in the
embryo, it seems plausible that these genes may play a
similar role in early embryonic development, given their
early and transient zygotic-specific expression profile.
Specialization of KLC genes is a recurrent event in evolution. In rat and mouse it was found that KLC3 is
restricted to spermatid tails while KLC1 and KLC2 are
only found in testis before meiosis [20]. A rat KLC isoform was found to associate with mitochondria in cultured cells [21]. In mouse it was also found that two KLCs
were present in the central and peripheral nervous system, but one is enriched in sciatic nerve exons and the
other is enriched in the olfactory bulb glomeruli [22].
These examples of KLC specialization are from mammals
and are consistent with the KLC diversity in mammals
demonstrated in Figure 2. Therefore, the fact that we can

We demonstrated that the promoter region of the two
AaKLC2 genes can direct early zygotic transcription in
the Ae. aegypti embryo. Thus this promoter may be useful to direct the expression of the antidote gene as part of
the Medea gene drive system [12,13]. The AaKLC2 genes
are expressed specifically, transiently, and early in the
embryonic stage, which makes them good candidates to
drive the antidote expression. The antidote needs to be
delivered at the appropriate time for embryonic rescue,
providing the replacement of mRNA that was targeted by
the maternal toxin. In addition, lack of antidote expression in the ovary will eliminate antagonist effects to the
toxin. Lastly, purely zygotic expression will eliminate concerns of ectopic expression that could reduce fitness and
thus reduce gene drive efficiency.

Conclusions
We have discovered a novel set of KLC genes in Ae.
aegypti that we call AaKLC2.1 and AaKLC2.2, and have
demonstrated that they are purely zygotic. These are the
first reported in any mosquito species and they have a
newly evolved expression pattern relative to the AaKLC1
genes. We have also identified a likely AaKlC2 gene
ortholog in C. quinquefasciatus. Its similar structure and
lack of representation in ESTs suggests that it is also a
zygotic gene. AaKLC2-like genes appear to be restricted
to Culicinae, as they are not detected in An. gambiae or
An. stephensi, or other genome sequences. Genomic survey of more species and additional expression analyses
will be needed to test these hypotheses. Data from ESTs
and hybridization experiments in addition to our transcriptome and expression analysis by RT-PCR support
the existence of two distinct KLC gene groups, the
zygotic AaKLC2-like genes, and the highly conserved
AaKLC1-like genes that are found in all mosquitoes and
insects surveyed. We also demonstrated strong promoter
activity of the AaKLC2 gene upstream sequence in Ae.
aegypti early embryos. Large-scale transcriptome profiling has proven to be a valuable method for the identification of early and transient zygotic-specific genes. These
technologies have allowed us to rapidly achieve results for
a specific objective. Moreover, as we are currently acquiring and analyzing more transcriptome data, we will be
able to investigate the complex and dynamic expression
of genes in the early embryo and conduct comparative

evolutionary studies with other mosquito species and
Drosophila.

Methods
Illumina Sequencing

Total RNA was isolated using TRIZOL RNA isolation
reagent (Molecular Research Center) from Ae. aegypti
Liverpool strain embryos at time points 0-2, 2-4, 4-8, and
8-12 hr. RNA was sent to Illumina (illumina.com) for
poly-A RNA transcriptome sequencing. Approximately
4.4-6.1 million mappable reads of 33 nt in length were
obtained per sample (Additional File 1). Annotated transcripts were used as queries for blastn searches against
the Illumina transcriptome sequence reads in different
samples, to count the number of sequence reads per
annotated transcript per sample. E-value of 1e-7 was used
as cutoff for the BLAST analysis. Normalization method
is described in the footnotes of Table 1. See Additional
File 1 for a tabulated summary of the Illumina RNA
sequence data and Additional File 2 for a FASTA file of
the Illumina reads that matched the three KLC transcripts AAEL011410, AAEL014967, and AAEL012472.
Mosquito rearing and embryo collection

Ae. aegypti Liverpool strain mosquitoes were reared in
incubators at 28°C and 60% relative humidity on a 16 hr
light/8 hr dark photoperiod. Larvae and pupae were fed
Sera Micron Fry Food with brewer's yeast, and Purina
Game Fish Chow. Mosquitoes were blood-fed on female
Hsd:ICR (CD-1®) mice (Harlan Laboratories http://
www.harlan.com). Embryos were collected anywhere
from 72 to 96 hr post blood meal.
Phylogenetic Inference

Phylogenetic Inference was performed using MrBayes
v3.1.2 [23]. A total of forty-one conceptually translated
amino acid (aa) sequences were obtained from NCBI.
Sequences were aligned using ClustalX v2.0 [24] (pairwise alignment parameters: gap opening = 10.0, gap
extend = 0.1; multiple alignment parameters: gap opening
= 10.0, gap extend = 0.2). The final alignment of approximately 400 aa used for phylogenetic inference was
cropped to include obvious regions of conservation and
contained the predicted TPR and Rab5-binding domains
(see Additional File 3 for aa sequences and Additional File
4 for alignment in FASTA format). MrBayes was used to
test 10 fixed-rate aa models, choosing the Jones model
exclusively (posterior probability = 1.0) after running
700,000 generations. The tree is rooted using KLC
sequences from two prokaryotic species.
RNA isolation and RT-PCR

Total RNA was isolated for different life stages and ovaries from Ae. aegypti Liverpool strain mosquitoes using

Page 7 of 9

the TRIZOL RNA isolation reagent (Molecular Research
Center). RNA was treated with Turbo DNA-free
(Ambion) to remove any residual genomic DNA. 1 ug
total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis with the First
Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit and Oligo dT20 (Invitrogen).
The final 21 microliter (ul) reaction volume was diluted
by adding 21 ul of nuclease-free H20. One ul of this was
used for 30 cycles of PCR with Taq Polymerase, dNTPs,
and 10× buffer (Takara). Genomic and transcript
sequences from the Ae. aegypti genome [25] were
retrieved from http://aaegypti.vectorbase.org/index.php
and http://www.ensembl.org/index.html. A 467 base
region of AaKLC2.1 (transcript ID: AAEL011410-RA)
cDNA was amplified using forward primer 5'-CTACCAGAAGCCATCAAACAT-3' Tm = 60.5°C, and reverse
primer 5'- GATTCACTGTCACCATTCTGTGT-3' Tm =
62.8°C. A 464 base region of AaKLC2.2 (transcript ID:
AAEL011410-RA) cDNA was amplified using forward
primer 5'- CCCGAAGCCATTAAACAC-3' Tm = 60.5°C
and reverse primer 5'- TGATTCACTGTCACCATTCTGTAC-3' Tm = 62.7°C. Both of these PCR products were
cloned and sequenced to verify the primer's specificity for
each transcript. A 550 base region of AaKLC1 (transcript
ID: AAEL012472-RA) cDNA spanning 3 introns was
amplified using forward primer 5'- ACTATGTTGAACATCCTGGCTTTAG-3' Tm = 63.1°C, and reverse
primer 5'- TCGATTTGTTCTCTTCTCTTTCTTC-3'
Tm = 62.8°C. The expected genomic product size is 28.8
kb. As a control for cDNA synthesis and for gel loading, a
562 base region of the ribosomal protein S7 (RPS7)
cDNA was amplified using forward primer 5'-ATGGTTTTCGGATCAAAGG-3' Tm = 61.3°C, and reverse
primer 5'-GGAATTCGAACGTAACGTCAC-3' Tm =
63.2°C. The expected genomic size is 5.5 kb. Negative
control reactions without the use of reverse transcriptase
were performed to test for genomic DNA contamination.
Embryonic injection and luciferase assay

Ae. aegypti Liverpool strain embryos were injected with
pGL3-basic firefly luciferase reporter plasmid (Promega)
containing 1042 bp of the 5' UTR and upstream genomic
sequence of the AaKLC2.1 early transient zygotic gene
(gene ID: AAEL011410). For each injection group, an
average of 45 embryos were injected at approximately 1
hr after deposition with 0.30 ug/ul of plasmid either with
or without (negative control) insert. A Renilla luciferase
reporter pRL-null (Promega) with the D. melanogaster
actin promoter was used as an injection control at 0.15
ug/ul. 1× Injection Buffer used was 5 mM KCl 0.1 mM
NaH2PO4 pH 7.2, sterile filtered. Embryos were homogenized in Cell Culture Lysis Buffer at 3 hr and 5 hr after
deposition and assayed for luciferase activity using the
Luciferase Assay System (Promega) and a Glomax 20/20
luminometer (Promega). Samples were read for 10 sec-

an Eppendorf FemtoJet allowing injection solution to
free-flow through the needle with the compensation
pressure (Pc) set at ~3750 hPa. Injection Pressure setting
(Pi) not used. The needle is held in a World Precision
