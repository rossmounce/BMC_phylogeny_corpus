Abstract
Background: Domain fusion analysis is a useful method to predict functionally linked proteins that
may be involved in direct protein-protein interactions or in the same metabolic or signaling
pathway. As separate domain databases like BLOCKS, PROSITE, Pfam, SMART, PRINTS-S,
ProDom, TIGRFAMs, and amalgamated domain databases like InterPro continue to grow in size
and quality, a computational method to perform domain fusion analysis that leverages on these
efforts will become increasingly powerful.
Results: This paper proposes a computational method employing relational algebra to find domain
fusions in protein sequence databases. The feasibility of this method was illustrated on the SWISSPROT+TrEMBL sequence database using domain predictions from the Pfam HMM (hidden Markov
model) database. We identified 235 and 189 putative functionally linked protein partners in H.
sapiens and S. cerevisiae, respectively. From scientific literature, we were able to confirm many of
these functional linkages, while the remainder offer testable experimental hypothesis. Results can
be viewed at http://calcium.uhnres.utoronto.ca/pi.
Conclusion: As the analysis can be computed quickly on any relational database that supports
standard SQL (structured query language), it can be dynamically updated along with the sequence
and domain databases, thereby improving the quality of predictions over time.

Background
The complex metabolic and signaling pathways within
the cell are controlled by highly coordinated and intricate
protein-protein interactions. Information regarding such
protein-protein interactions can be obtained from biochemical and biophysical methods like co-immunoprecipitation [1], yeast two-hybrid [2] and mass spectrometry
[3,4]. To complement these often time-consuming experimental methods, computational methods for predicting
functional linkages have been developed. Some methods
use protein surface interfaces [5,6]; some use the ordering

and/or proximity of genes in genomes [7–9]; while others
use the co-occurrences of genes in genomes [10,11].
Recently, computational methods that exploit domaindomain relationships have been introduced and proven
to be useful for the prediction of functional linkages in genomic research [12–15]. In particular, domain fusion
analysis exploits the fact that certain proteins in a given
genome consist of fused domains that correspond to single, full-length proteins in other genomes [13–15]. The
proteins with fused domains in a given genome are likely
to directly interact or be involved in the same metabolic

and signaling pathways. In their analysis of the M. genitalium genome, Huynen et al. showed that the occurrence of
a domain fusion event was highly correlated with function [16].

predicate; A × B is the cartesian product operation, which
creates a permutation of information between A and B;
π(A.attribute1, A.attribute2,...)(A) is the projection operation,
which extracts specified attributes from A.

The query genome is defined as the genome where functional linkages are predicted, while the reference genome
is the amalgamation of all other genomes excluding the
query. Domain fusion events found in the reference genome predict functional linkages between proteins in the
query. To date, most domain fusion analysis have compared complete genomes of relatively small sizes and rely
on a BLAST comparison [17] between every protein of the
query genome to every protein of the reference
[13,14,16,18–20]. The analysis has not been applied to
larger non-redundant sequence databases such as SWISSPROT, although the analysis becomes a more powerful
prediction tool when more reference genomes are included. One reason for this limitation is that the computation
time becomes "prohibitively expensive" [18].

As a minimum, the database must have a sequence table
(denoted by S) and a domain layout table (denoted by D)
with some key attributes (Figure 1a). D stores the domain
layout of each of the sequences in S and is linked by the
seq_id attribute. Let Squery be the table of all protein sequences in the sequence database of the query genome
and let Sref be the table of all other sequences in the database comprising the reference genomes. Let Dquery and
Dref be the tables of all domain layouts belonging to the
query and reference genomes, respectively. Therefore,
Squery, Sref, Dquery, and Dref are defined by the following
relations:

Other groups have already appreciated the use of relational databases for domain fusion analysis [21,22]. To complement their work, we present a fast computational
method that enables domain fusion analysis on partial or
complete genomes in a non-redundant sequence database
using simple relational algebra operations. Instead of using BLAST comparisons, we leveraged on existing efforts
to predict protein domains by Pfam's HMM domain database [23]. Beginning with Pfam's domain layout prediction of each protein in the SWISS-PROT+TrEMBL protein
sequence database, we applied successive relational algebra operations using SQL to identify putative functional
linkages, especially in H. sapiens and S. cerevisiae. These results are compared with experimentally demonstrated cases and published protein interaction databases. Finally,
we discuss various factors that can generate false positives.

Algorithm
The majority of protein sequence and domain databases
are built on the relational database architecture. Typically,
data is acquired from a database of this type by relational
algebra operations in the form of SQL queries. Therefore,
a method that can be performed directly using these operations will save unnecessary conversion of data and leverage on the scalability and efficiency of commercial
RDBMS software (relational database management systems). Our method for finding domain fusions can be
performed entirely using relational algebra operations.

Squery = σgenome ="query genome" ( S )

Sref = σgenome ≠"query genome" ( S )
D
Dquery = πD.seq_id , D.dom (σD.seq_id =Squery .seq_id (D Squery ))
Dref = πD.seq_id , D.dom (σD.seq_id =Sref .seq_id (D × Sref ))

Let Fquery and Fref be the table of all possible domain fusion templates (DFTs) in the query and reference genomes, respectively. The idea of DFTs is conceptually similar to
Rosetta stone [14] and composite proteins [13]. For example, if a gene has four different domains ABCD, there are
six different DFTs: AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, and CD.
Let Dq1 and Dq2 be copies of Dquery and let Dr1 and Dr2
be copies of Dref. Fquery and Fref can be found by performing a projection and selection operation following a cartesian product between the corresponding domain tables.
This operation will enumerate all permutations of DFTs.
For example, if gene has three different domains ABC,
then there are nine possible permutations of DFTs: AA,
AB, AC, BA, BB, BC, CA, CB, and CC. The desired DFTs do
not have the same domains (i.e., AA, BB, and CC) and order does not matter (i.e., AB is the same as BA). To remove
same domain DFTs, the following clauses are added to the
selection predicates: (Dq1.dom≠Dq2.dom) for Fquery and
(Dr1.dom≠Dr2.dom) for Fref. At this stage, it is not necessary to consider the removal of one of the two alternatively ordered DFTs.

Fquery = πDq1.dom,Dq2 .dom (σ(Dq1.seq_id =Dq2 .seq_id)^(Dq1.dom≠Dq2 .dom)(Dq1 Dq2 ))

The method is described using relational algebra notation
with the following conventions: bold text refers to a table;
A.attribute refers to an attribute or column of A; σ(predicate)(A) is the selection operation with the predicate in parenthesis, which selects rows in A that satisfy the

Protein sequences from SWISS-PROT+TrEMBL were divided into query sequences (belonging to the genome of interest) or
reference sequences (everything else). All possible DFTs of the query or reference sequences were then permutated using a
single SQL command. The valid DFTs were found by subtracting the query set from the reference set. Finally, using the valid
DFTs, all functional linkages were permutated. The number of putative functional linkages is generally large, so it is necessary to
filter out false positives.

genome. Therefore, Fput can be found by the difference
between Fref and Fquery.
Fput = Fref - Fquery

(7)

Finally, let Pput be the table of putative functional linkages
in the query genome. Pput can be obtained by performing
a projection and selection operation following a cartesian
product between Dq1, Dq2 and Fput. This operation will,
for each DFT in Fput, enumerate all permutations of proteins that contain the first domain in the DFT to proteins
that contain the second domain in the DFT. Note that this
operation can be more efficiently performed if Fput includes only domains found in the query genome.
Pput = πDq1.seq_id,Dq2 .seq_id (σ(Fput .dom1=Dq1.dom)^(Fput .dom2=Dq2 .dom)(Fput Dq1 Dq2 )) ( 8 )

Remember the alternatively ordered DFTs have not been
removed. Therefore, if there is a putative functional linkage between protein A and protein B, there will also be a
functional linkage between protein B and protein A in
Pput. To remove these redundant putative functional linkages, it is easiest to re-insert the all rows in Pput into a new
table with a database trigger enabled that restricts the row
insertion of protein A and protein B, if the row of protein
B and protein A exists.

Results and Discussion
Domain fusion analysis of H. sapiens and S. cerevisiae
From our domain fusion analysis on the SWISSPROT+TrEMBL database, we identified 235 and 189 putative functionally linked protein partners in H. sapiens and
S. cerevisiae, respectively (Table 1). While it is difficult to
rigorously determine the accuracy of the predictions as
not all protein-protein interactions have been mapped in
these genomes, we searched protein interaction databases
[24–26] and scientific abstracts on PubMed for those protein partners that have both gene names mentioned in the
same article. The databases and scientific literature clearly
indicated a functional linkage (such as gene proximity, a
complex formation or common pathway) in 33 and 35
protein partners in H. sapiens and S. cerevisiae, respectively
(Table 2). For example, we identified three known pairs of
functionally linked proteins and one hypothetical in the
H. sapiens and S. cerevisiae (Figure 2). First, a glyoxylate cycle protein [27] in C. elegans and D. melanogaster corresponds to two proteins (MASY_YEAST and ACEA_YEAST)
that are known to be involved in glyoxylate cycle of C. albicans [28] (Figure 2a). Second, COXW_YEAST and
Q12184 are involved in heme A synthesis in S. cerevisiae
[29] (Figure 2b). Third, the levels of O76091 and
FHIT_HUMAN mRNA are highly correlated in mouse homologs [30] (Figure 2c). Lastly, the functional linkage of
TYSY_HUMAN and DYR_HUMAN is predicted by the do-

main fusions in many grain genomes including Z. mays,
G. max and A. thaliana (Figure 2d). There was a higher percentage of positives in S. cerevisiae largely due to the extensive work in mapping protein-protein interactions in yeast
using two-hybrid screens [31,32], microarrays [33,34] and
mass spectrometry [3,4].
In H. sapiens sequences, there were 771 DFTs arising from
208 organisms, while in S. cerevisiae there were 1,491
DFTs from 328 organisms. The uneven sequence sampling in the SWISS-PROT+TrEMBL database skews the absolute distribution of organisms, however the
distributions relative to each other are interesting. When
comparing the relative changes in the distributions, the effect of uneven sampling of organisms in our database is
normalized. Specifically, if the probability of finding a
DFT is equal in all sequences, then the genomic distribution of the source of the DFTs would be the same as the
source of the reference sequences (Figure 3a). The genomic distribution of DFTs for S. cerevisiae and H. sapiens are
different to the reference sequences and to each other (Figure 3b,3c). In H. sapiens, the multicellular eukaryotic organisms (such as M. musculus) have advanced in the top
ten sources, whereas the single cellular organisms (such as
E. coli) have declined. Additionally, while C. elegans is still
in the top ten sources of DFTs, it requires 476 sequences
to find one DFT compared to 45 for X. laevis (Table 3).
Conversely, in S. cerevisiae, single cellular organisms (such
as M. tuberculosis) have advanced in the top ten sources
and multicellular eukaryotic organisms have declined.
Furthermore, distantly related organisms appear to require more sequences per DFT, yet closely related organisms do not require the fewest sequences per DFT (Table
4). One possible explanation is that domain fusions require evolutionary time to accumulate, however, if too
much time passes, it may be lost. This suggests that domain fusion events cannot be used to accurately predict
phylogeny, since their absence could be the result of too
short or too long evolutionary distance.
Effect of our distinct definition of a fusion event
Previous methods for domain fusion analysis [13,14,20]
are essentially identical to our method, except that our
method specifically finds individual "domain" fusions,
whereas the previous methods used full-length proteins
from one organism, which correspond to a fused fulllength protein in another organism. We chose our approach as many proteins consist of multiple domains. For
example, consider a fusion protein in the reference organism consisting of domains ABCD, which corresponds to
two separate proteins in the query organism, consisting of
domains AB and CD. Using our method, the list of reference DFTs would be AB, AC, AD, BC, BD and CD; the list
of query DFTs would be AB and CD. Therefore, the valid
DFTs that can be used for predicting functional linkages

are AC, AD, BC and BD. All four DFTs would predict the
same functional linkage between the two query organism
proteins. In contrast, previous methods would have only
a single fusion event that predicts this functional linkage.
Therefore, an additional advantage of our approach is that
the number of different DFTs predicting a functional linkage could be used to rank our prediction confidence.

ed functional linkage was performed manually through a
literature search, there was a limitation to the number of
linkages that could be screened. Therefore, we stringently
defined a promiscuous DFT as one involved in 10 or more
functional linkage predictions (Figure 4). For a higher tolerance for false positives, it is possible to use a value greater than 10.

Consideration of splice variants
Splice variants are treated intermediately as separate genes
in our method since each variant may interact with different proteins. For example, consider a query gene with two
variants: one variant consisting of domains ABC while another consisting of domains AC. If it is found that BD is a
valid DFT for functional linkage prediction, then the first
splice variant could be involved in a putative functional
linkage that the second is not. Finally, the putative functional linkages of the gene would be the union of functional linkages of the splice variants.

Another possible source of false positives is the inability
to list all the DFTs in the query genome. For example, consider two query genes: one consisting of a domain A while
another consisting of a domain B. If it is found that AB is
a valid DFT for functional linkage prediction, then the two
query genes are perhaps functionally linked. However, if
the query genome's DFT list is incomplete, AB may potentially exist and therefore, the two query genes may be
falsely predicted as functionally linked. A number of factors can cause this problem including the use of an incomplete query genome, absent or inaccurate profile HMM
domains and the erroneous prediction of intron and exon
sites.

Consideration of false positives
Any prediction method could produce false positive results. Here, we consider several sources of false positives,
which may be generated by the present method. A false
positive can occur when a functional linkage is predicted
between two proteins where none exists. One possible
source of false positives in domain fusion analysis is the
promiscuity or paralogy in domains (for example, BTB,
PDZ, SH2 and SH3 domains), which occur at a high frequency in many different protein sequences that do not
share similar functions [13,14,20]. The removal of promiscuous domains reduces false positives, but the criterion for classifying them is a difficult problem. One
criterion relies on finding domains with a Z-score greater
than 10 [13,20], while another on domains that are involved in domain fusions events with more than 25 other
domains [14].

In our analysis, instead of removing promiscuous domains altogether, we removed only promiscuous DFTs.
For example, the RasGAP domain is involved in 72
functional linkages with the SH3 domain in the H. sapiens
genes in the SWISS-PROT+TrEMBL database, however it is
only involved in 2 functional linkages with the BTK domain. The DFT of RasGAP and SH3 is more promiscuous
than RasGAP and BTK. Since the verification of a predict-

The domain fusion analysis using relational algebra presented here relies on the prediction of domains from profile HMMs. In contrast, previous approaches to domain
fusion analysis often employed heuristic local pairwise sequence alignment (PSA) algorithms such as BLAST [17].
Such algorithms emphasize finding long high scoring local alignments, however, the most strongly conserved residues are commonly distributed across the domain.
Therefore, the key drawback of a heuristic PSA-based
approach in domain fusion analysis is its relative insensitivity for finding remote homologs and, consequently, domain fusions. Within the last decade, however, the
sensitivity of sequence searching techniques has been improved by profile- or motif-based analysis, like the profile
HMM, which uses information derived from multiple sequence alignments to construct and search for sequence
domains and patterns [35–37]. Unlike the heuristic PSA
algorithms, a profile or motif can exploit additional information, such as the position and identity of residues that
are conserved throughout the domain, as well as variable
insertion and deletion probabilities. Therefore, the advantage of the profile HMM is the sensitivity and accurate delineation of domains, however, the key drawback is its
reliance on the accurate construction of a profile HMM for

all domains. If the profile HMM of a domain is not constructed or carelessly done, it will not find all putative domains and, consequently, domain fusions. Thus, as the
quality and quantity of separate domain databases increases such as BLOCKS [36], PROSITE [35], Pfam [23],
SMART [38], PRINTS-S [39], ProDom [40], TIGRFAMs
[41] and amalgamated domain databases such as InterPro
[22], our approach to domain fusion analysis will also become increasingly powerful.

Conclusions
The relational algebra method presented here offers an alternative approach to performing domain fusion analysis
that leverages on existing efforts to improve the size and
quality of domain and motif databases. We have
illustrated the efficacy of the method by identifying many
possible functional linkages in H. sapiens and S. cerevisiae
sequences in the SWISS-PROT+TrEMBL database. Interestingly, the genomic distribution of the sources of DFTs suggests that DFTs are not likely found either in closely or
remotely related organisms, but rather there is a balance
between the two extremes that is tilted toward closely

related organisms. Finally, future work could expand the
method presented here to other genomes of interest.

Methods
The analysis was performed on the Oracle RDBMS (version 8) installed on a computer with a dual 750 MHz UltraSPARC-III processor and 4 G of RAM running SunOS
5.8. Sequence information from SWISS-PROT (Release
39) + TrEMBL (Release 17) and domain architecture information from Pfam was migrated to the sequence table and
domain layout table of the database, respectively, by Perl
and Oracle SQL*loader scripts. To perform the analysis,
relational algebra expressions were converted to SQL
statements and executed by an Oracle SQL*Plus client
connected to the database server. The total computation
time for H. sapiens and S. cerevisiae were approximately 4
and 3 hours, respectively.

expected, the general distribution of the S. cerevisiae and H. sapiens are almost identical. Some DFTs such as ig and SH3 in H.
sapiens and rrm and pkinase in S. cerevisiae predict over 5,000 functional linkages. These DFTs are promiscuous and should be
removed from the analysis because they predict functional linkages between proteins that are likely unrelated. In the analysis
we applied a stringent definition of a promiscuous DFT – those being involved in greater than 10 predicted functional linkages.
