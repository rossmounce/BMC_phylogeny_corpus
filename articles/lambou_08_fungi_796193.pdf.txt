Abstract
Background: Tetraspanins are small membrane proteins that belong to a superfamily encompassing 33 members in human and
mouse. These proteins act as organizers of membrane-signalling complexes. So far only two tetraspanin families have been
identified in fungi. These are Pls1, which is required for pathogenicity of the plant pathogenic ascomycetes, Magnaporthe grisea,
Botrytis cinerea and Colletotrichum lindemuthianum, and Tsp2, whose function is unknown. In this report, we describe a third family
of tetraspanins (Tsp3) and a new family of tetraspanin-like proteins (Tpl1) in fungi. We also describe expression of some of these
genes in M. grisea and a basidiomycete, Laccaria bicolor, and also their functional analysis in M. grisea.
Results: The exhaustive search for tetraspanins in fungal genomes reveals that higher fungi (basidiomycetes and ascomycetes)
contain three families of tetraspanins (Pls1, Tsp2 and Tsp3) with different distribution amongst phyla. Pls1 is found in
ascomycetes and basidiomycetes, whereas Tsp2 is restricted to basidiomycetes and Tsp3 to ascomycetes. A unique copy of each
of PLS1 and TSP3 was found in ascomycetes in contrast to TSP2, which has several paralogs in the basidiomycetes, Coprinus
cinereus and Laccaria bicolor. A tetraspanin-like family (Tpl1) was also identified in ascomycetes. Transcriptional analyses in various
tissues of L. bicolor and M. grisea showed that PLS1 and TSP2 are expressed in all tissues in L. bicolor and that TSP3 and TPL1 are
overexpressed in the sexual fruiting bodies (perithecia) and mycelia of M. grisea, suggesting that these genes are not
pseudogenes. Phenotypic analysis of gene replacementmutants Δtsp3 and Δtpl1 of M. grisea revealed a reduction of the
pathogenicity only on rice, in contrast to Δpls1 mutants, which are completely non-pathogenic on barley and rice.
Conclusion: A new tetraspanin family (Tsp3) and a tetraspanin-like protein family (Tpl1) have been identified in fungi. Functional
analysis by gene replacement showed that these proteins, as well as Pls1, are involved in the infection process of the plant
pathogenic fungus M. grisea. The next challenge will be to decipher the role(s) of tetraspanins in a range of symbiotic, saprophytic
and human pathogenic fungi.

Background
Tetraspanins are a superfamily of small integral membrane proteins that were first identified in mammals as
cell-specific antigens [1] and, since then, in fishes, insects,
worms, sponges [2] and fungi [2,3]. They are not found in
plants, although tetraspanin-like proteins were identified
in Arabidopsis thaliana [4,5]. To date, at least 33 distinct tetraspanins have been identified in humans, 37 in Drosophila melanogaster and 20 in Caenorhabditis elegans [2].
Animal tetraspanins interact tightly and specifically with
other membrane proteins and have been proposed to act
as molecular facilitators of membrane protein complexes
[1,6]. Animal tetraspanins are also able to interact with
other tetraspanins to form a scaffold that promotes the
recruitment of tetraspanin-associated proteins, hence creating a web [7]. As a consequence of this complexity, tetraspanin webs from different cell types differ markedly in
their protein composition and probably also in their cellular function. This may explain the diversity of phenotypes observed among tetraspanin knockout mutants in
animals. Indeed, tetraspanin null mutants are altered in
diverse unrelated processes such as sperm-egg fusion, susceptibility to parasites or viruses, neuronal or lymphocyte
cell-cell interactions, cell adhesion, motility and polarity
and protein trafficking [1,6,8].
Although tetraspanins display limited amino acid
sequence similarity, they share conserved structural hallmarks consisting of four transmembrane domains (TM1
to TM4), a small extracellular loop (ECL1), an intracellular loop (ICL) and a large extracellular loop (ECL2) containing a characteristic cysteine-based pattern [9,10]. In
fungi, the first tetraspanin identified was in the plant pathogenic fungus M. grisea and was named Pls1 ([3]; Figure
1). Since then, genes homologous to PLS1 have been
identified in other ascomycetes [11] and basidiomycetes
[2]. The functional role of Pls1 in the fungal cell has been
investigated in three plant pathogenic ascomycetes [12],
namely M. grisea (MgPls1, [3]), Botrytis cinerea (BcPls1,
[13]) and Colletotrichum lindemuthianum (ClPls1, [14]).
These fungi are responsible for major diseases of agriculturally important plants, M. grisea causing the most devastating fungal disease of rice (blast) worldwide, B. cinerea
being a necrotrophic pathogen affecting more than 200
different host plants and C. lindemuthianum causing
anthracnose diseases on a wide range of crops and ornamental plants. During the infection process, these fungi
differentiate a specialized cell called the appressorium
that is able to perforate the plant cuticle and cell wall,
allowing the fungus to penetrate into host tissues. The
ΔMgpls1, ΔBcpls1 and ΔClpls1 null mutants were all nonpathogenic on intact host plant tissues. Although the
mutants could differentiate appressoria, these infection
structures were unable to direct the penetration of the fungus into host plant tissues [3,13,14]. These results demon-

Schematic structure of Pls1 tetraspanins
Schematic structure of Pls1 tetraspanins. Tetraspanins
contain four transmembrane domains (TM1 to TM4) with
conserved polar/charged residues (pink circles), a small
extracellular loop (ECL1), a small intracellular loop (ICL) and
a large extracellular loop (ECL2). ECL2 contains a CCG
motif and further two conserved cysteine residues (yellow
circles). The N-terminal and C-terminal tails are intracellular.
These cysteine residues allow formation of two disulphide
bridges (red lines), crucial for the folding of ECL2. One putative palmitoylation site is located proximal to TM4 (green circle).

strate that Pls1 tetraspanins are involved in a function
conserved among fungi that is essential for appressoriummediated penetration.
Previous studies suggested that fungal genomes possess a
single tetraspanin gene [11]. However, analysis of recently
sequenced fungal genomes revealed that besides Pls1
orthologs, basidiomycetes have other tetraspanins called
Tsp2 [2]. This prompted us to systematically search for
novel tetraspanins in fungal genomes and EST databases
to better characterize this protein family in fungi. Using
low stringency BlastP and HMM (Hidden Markov Model)
searches using the PFAM tetraspanin profile (PF00335),
we identified a novel tetraspanin (Tsp3) and a tetraspanin-like protein (Tpl1) in M. grisea and their
orthologs in other ascomycetes. Furthermore, genes from
the TSP2 family were identified in newly available basidiomycete genomes and they displayed a complex evolutionary history with numerous paralogs. The expression
profiles of PLS1, TSP2, TSP3 and TPL1 were determined
by quantitative RT-PCR in M. grisea or by microarray analysisin the symbiotic L. bicolor. Expression of these genes
was also estimated in silico by compiling their occurrence
in EST or cDNA libraries. Finally, a functional study of
TSP3 and TPL1 was performed in M. grisea, whereby deletion mutants were constructed by targeted gene replace-

ment and compared to the existing Δpls1 mutant. In
marked contrast to this latter mutant, which was fully
non-pathogenic on barley and rice, the Δtsp3 and Δtpl1
mutants were reduced in pathogenicity only on rice. Thus
deletion of these genes has a host-specific effect on the
pathogenicity of M. grisea which is different from that of
the PLS1 deletion.

Results
Pls1 tetraspanins are widespread in ascomycetes and
basidiomycetes
Proteins homologous to Pls1 [see Additional file 1] and
[Additional file 2] were identified using Blastp in all available sequenced genomes of ascomycetes (Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Leptosphaeria maculans, Podospora anserina,
Chaetomium globosum, Trichoderma reesei, Fusarium verticilloides, Nectria haematococca, Stagonospora nodorum, Coccidioides posadasii) and basidiomycetes (Laccaria bicolor),
except Ustilago maydis, Cryptoccocus neoformans, Aspergillus
species, Mycosphaerella graminicola, and all Saccharomycotina species (hemi-ascomycetes). Another strategy based
on the use of the tetraspanin HMM profile (PF00335)
revealed a single Pls1 tetraspanin in the same fungal
genomes. SsPLS1, LmPLS1, PaPLS1, GzPLS1, CpPLS1
cDNAs were obtained either from cDNA libraries or
reconstructed from ESTs and used to define introns and
start and stop codons in the corresponding genes.

the last two cysteine residues whereas, it is located
between the second and the last cysteine residues of the
ECL2 in animal tetraspanins. Interestingly, in animals this
variable region contains sites involved in specific tetraspanin protein-protein interactions [10]. The cysteinebased pattern of fungal Pls1 tetraspanins (CCGY-x(13)-Cx(11/19)-C-x(14)-TM4) contains a conserved tyrosine residue located after the CCG motif that is not in the
cysteine-based pattern of animal tetraspanins (Figures 1
and 2, [Additional file 1] and [Additional file 2]). The
cysteine-based pattern of ascomycete Pls1 EC2 (CCGYx(13)-C-x(10)-GC-x(14)-TM4) is slightly different from
that found in Pls1 from basidiomycetes (CCGY-x(13)-Cx(19)-C-x(14)-TM4, [Additional file 1] and [Additional
file 2]) suggesting their ECL2 tertiary structure slightly differs from those of ascomycetes. The amino acid sequences
of the C-terminal tail of fungal Pls1 tetraspanins are
strongly conserved and are rich in charged/polar amino
acids (average 70%). Indeed, these C-terminal tails display a conserved RxExERF/YxxIDxK motif found in Pls1
from ascomycetes as well as from basidiomycetes [see
Additional file 1]. This conservation suggests that the Cterminal tail of fungal Pls1 tetraspanins plays a functional
role as does that of animal tetraspanins [18,19].

The sequence conservation between the different Pls1 tetraspanins is essentially in the TM domains, some regions
of the ECL2 including its cysteine-based pattern (CCGYx(13)-C-x(11/19)-C-x(14)-TM4) and the C-terminal tail
(Figure 2, [Additional file 1] and [Additional file 2]). The
ECL1 sequences are more variable, as those in basidiomycete Pls1 proteins (17 aa) are shorter than in ascomycetes (26 aa). Similarly, the conserved motif in ICL from
Pls1 proteins of basidiomycetes (QRNHVTLGLV) is very
different from that found in Pls1 from ascomycetes
(RGWLK). Three TM domains contain charged/polar
amino acids (D in TM1, S/T in TM2, T in TM4) conserved
among all Pls1 proteins. Some Pls1 proteins from ascomycetes have additional charged/polar amino acids (N in
TM2, S/T in TM3 and D in TM4; see Figure 1 and [Additional file 1]). In animal tetraspanins, these conserved
polar/charged amino acids are thought to stabilize interactions between transmembrane domains [10]. A putative
palmitoylation site (cysteine residue) is located at the end
of TM4 in most Pls1 tetraspanins, except those from the
Leotiomycetes, Botrytis cinerea and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum
(Figures 1 and 2, [Additional file 1]). In animals, the
palmitoylation of several conserved juxtamembrane
cysteine residues influences the formation of tetraspaninenriched membrane microdomains [15-17]. A variable
region is located in the ECL2 loop of fungal Pls1 tetraspanins (Figures 1 and 2, [Additional file 1]), between

Tsp2 tetraspanins are restricted to basidiomycetes
Prior to this study, the first set of Tsp2 tetraspanins was
identified in basidiomycetes such as Coprinus cinereus
(CcTsp2A, CcTsp2B, CcTsp2C), Phanerochaete chrysosporium (PcTsp2) and Cryptococcus neoformans (CnTsp2, [2]).
Tsp2 proteins display a long N-terminal tail (83 to 200 aa)
and a long C-terminal cytoplasmic tail (66 to 101 aa).
These domain lengths are characteristic of the Tsp2 family
as Pls1 tetraspanins contain only short N-terminal and Cterminal tails (3–5 and 17–22 aa, respectively, Figure 2
and [Additional file 3]). Furthermore, the C-terminal tails
of Tsp2 proteins are not as rich in charged amino acids
(30%) as those of Pls1 proteins (60–75%). We identified
four homologues of TSP2 (LbTSP2A, LbTSP2B, LbTS2C
and LbTSP2D) in the basidiomycete L. bicolor. The correspondingcDNAs reconstructed from ESTs were used to
define introns and start/stop codons in the corresponding
genes. This family displays all the structural hallmarks of
tetraspanin secondary structure with four transmembrane
domains, a small extracellular loop (ECL1, 19 aa), a small
intracellular loop (ICL, 4 aa), a large extracellular loop
(ECL2, 72 aa) with a typical cysteine-based pattern
(CCGY/F-x(12)-CY/F-x(6)-GCK-x(13)-TM4) and a conserved C-terminal cytoplasmic tail (Figure 2, [Additional
file 2] and [Additional file 3]). Three TM domains contain
one or two conserved charged/polar amino acids (N and
Y in TM1, S and T in TM2 and Y in TM3) as observed for
animal and fungal Pls1 tetraspanins [10,11]. One putative
conserved palmitoylation site (a cysteine residue at the
junction between a transmembrane domain and an intracellular domain) is located at the end of TM4, proximal to
the inner side of the membrane according to the predicted
fungal tetraspanin topology. Additionally, LbTsp2A and
PcTsp2 display another putative palmitoylation site
(cysteine residue) at the start of TM1, proximal to the
inner side of the membrane. We were not able to identify
proteins orthologous to Tsp2 in ascomycetes using blast
analysis or the tetraspanin HMM profile.
Tsp3 is a novel tetraspanin family specific to ascomycetes
We identified a novel tetraspanin in M. grisea which we
named MgTsp3, using the tetraspanin HMM profile
(PF00335). MgTsp3 is a modified version of
MGG_13913.5 and annotation errors were corrected
using the TSP3 cDNA sequence. This novel tetraspanin
displays the structural hallmarks of tetraspanins including
a characteristic cysteine-based pattern (CCG-x(18/22)-Cx(9)-C-x(11)-TM4) and a C-terminal tail containing a
high proportion of polar/charged amino acids (70%; Figures 2 and 3). However, it differs from Pls1 of ascomycetes
in the following features: a lack of charged/polar amino
acid in TM domains, a smaller ECL1 (8 aa compared to 26
aa), a longer ICL (22–25 aa compared to 8 aa) and a
longer C-terminal tail (70–110 aa compared to 17–22 aa)

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/63

similar in size to that of Tsp2 proteins from basidiomycetes (66 to 101 aa, Figure 2).
Proteins homologous to Tsp3 were detected only in ascomycetes, including P. anserina, T. reesei, N. crassa, C. globosum, G. zeae, S. nodorum, B. cinerea, S. sclerotiorum and
Uncinocarpus reesii (Figure 3). A Tsp3 homologue was
identified in Aspergillus niger, this being the first report of
an Aspergillus tetraspanin (Figure 3). In marked contrast,
the Tsp3 protein is absent from basidiomycete genomes.
The amplification of MgTSP3 cDNA obtained by RT-PCR
allowed the identification of three introns at positions 37,
66 and 595 bp. Other TSP3 genes were aligned to ESTs
when available [see Additional file 2], allowing prediction
of their exon positions and their corresponding proteins
in N. crassa and S. sclerotiorum. The number of introns varies between one and four in the Sordariaceae, with a conserved intron at position 31 bp from the start codon [see
Additional file 2]. TSP3 genes from Leotiomycetes (Botrytis cinerea and S. sclerotiorum) have four introns at conserved positions [see Additional file 2]. SnTsp3 and TrTsp3
did notdisplay four transmembrane domains; however,
this is probably due to a sequence gap and an incorrect
intron annotation, respectively. For this reason, these
genes were not included in the comparative analysis.
Overall Tsp3 sequences are not as conserved as Pls1 and
Tsp2 proteins from the same range of species (Figures 3).
In particular, ICL and C-terminal tail are not conserved,
unlike that in Pls1 proteins (Figures 3).
Tpl1 is a tetraspanin-like protein restricted to ascomycetes
In addition to the tetraspanins described above, the M.
grisea genomecontains a tetraspanin-like gene, which we
have named TPL1 (MGG_08113.5). This gene was identified by use of the tetraspanin HMM profile (PF00335) not
only in M. grisea but also in other ascomycetes such as C.
globosum, S. nodorum, N. crassa, P. anserina and A. nidulans
(Figure 4). In marked contrast, the Tpl1 protein is absent
from basidiomycete genomes. The MgTPL1 cDNA was
reconstructed from ESTs and used to define introns and
start/stop codons. MgTPL1 has two introns at position 40
and 262 bp from ATG [see Additional file 2]. Tpl1 proteins display some structural hallmarks of tetraspanins
such as the presence of four transmembrane domains, a
small ECL1 loop (14 aa), a short ICL loop (6–12 aa), a
large ECL2 loop (56–68 aa) and a C-terminal cytoplasmic
tail (9–17 aa) similar in size to that of Pls1 tetraspanins
(Figures 2 and 4, [Additional file 2]). However, Tpl1 proteins markedly differ from Pls1, Tsp2 and Tsp3 tetraspanins in that they lack the typical cysteine basedpattern in the ECL2. Instead, they have two conserved
cysteine residues close to the TM3 and TM4, respectively
(Figures 2 and 4). For this reason, we have classified these
proteins as tetraspanin-like.

Alignment of Tsp3 tetraspanins
Alignment of Tsp3 tetraspanins. Sequences were aligned using ClustalX 1.8. Conserved amino acids are indicated in black
(>80%), dark gray (>60%) and light gray (>40%). The transmembrane domains (TM) are circled in black, the small extracellular
loop (ECL1), the small intracellular loop (ICL), the large extracellular loop (ECL2) are shown in gray, purple and orange lines,
respectively. ECL2 contains a CCG motif and further two conserved cysteine residues (red). These cysteine residues allow formation of two disulphide bridges crucial for the folding of ECL2. Mg: Magnaporthe grisea, Pa: Podospora anserina, Nc: Neurospora

Phylogeny of fungal tetraspanins reveals paralogs only in
the Tsp2 family
Protein sequences from Pls1, Tsp2 and Tsp3 families were
aligned using ClustalX 1.8 [see Additional file 4]. A phylogenetic analysis was then conducted using the PHYML
software. The Tpl1 tetraspanin-like family was excluded
from this alignment as these proteins are too divergent
from Pls1, Tsp2 and Tsp3 proteins to be aligned correctly.

The resulting phylogenetic tree (Figure 5) shows that Pls1,
Tsp2 and Tsp3 form three distinct families. This phylogenetic tree also shows that the PLS1 genes from ascomycetes and basidiomycetes are orthologs, as the tree is
congruent to the corresponding species phylogeny [20].
Similarly, TSP3 genes are orthologs (Figure 5). The TSP2
family consists of numerous paralogs, some being recent
as their closest relative gene is in the same species (Tsp2B

Phylogenetic tree of fungal Pls1, Tsp2 and Tsp3 tetraspanins
Phylogenetic tree of fungal Pls1, Tsp2 and Tsp3 tetraspanins. The Pls1, Tsp2 and Tsp3 were aligned using ClustalX 1.8. Aligned sequences were analyzed by maximum
likelihood using PHYML and RO3G_14268 and

and Tsp2D from L. bicolor). The Tsp2 cluster is rooted by
tetraspanins in the zygomycete, R. oryzae (RO3G_08988/
RoTsp2-A and RO3G_17009/RoTsp2-B). The presence of
tetraspanins in R. oryzae shows that this family of tetraspanins is ancient and predates the split between zygomycetes and higher fungi.
The number of introns in PLS1 genes varies from one to
three in ascomycetes and from three to four in basidio-

mycetes [see Additional file 2]. One intron position is
conserved in all PLS1 genes from ascomycetes (position
403, [see Additional file 2]) except in the related BcPLS1
and SsPLS1 (Leotiomycetes). This intron conservation
supports the orthology found between PLS1 genes from
ascomycetes. In PLS1 from basidiomycetes, three of the
four intron positions are conserved [see Additional file 2]
confirming a common origin for these three genes. The
number of introns in genes from the TSP2 family varies
from zero to four. However closely related TSP2 genes
such as CcTSP2A, CcTSP2B, LbTSP2B and LbTSP2D (60%
identity at the protein level) that cluster as a single clade
in the phylogenetic tree (Figure 5) share the 2 among
three introns, suggesting that they result from recent
duplications in both C. cinereus and L. bicolor genomes. In
Sordariaceae, TSP3 genes contain three introns [see Additional file 2] except N. crassa which has four, although this
may be due to an incorrect exon/intron annotation in the
N. crassa gene that could not been corrected since it has no
ESTs. Other TSP3 genes have three conserved intron positions (positions 31–52, 60–81 and 565–601, [see Additional file 2]) except in the related BcPLS1 and SsPLS1
(Leotiomycetes), which have an additional specific
intron. This conservation of intron number and position
supports the orthology between TSP3 genes.
Expression of fungal genes encoding tetraspanins
The expression patterns of PLS1, TSP2, TSP3 and TPL1
were evaluated in different fungal species in silico (absence
or presence of ESTs from various libraries, [see Additional
file 2]), and by quantitative PCR in M. grisea for MgPLS1,
MgTSP3 and MgTPL1 (Figure 6) or by microarrays in L.
bicolor for LbPLS1, LbTSP2-A, LbTSP2-B, LbTSP2-C and
LbTSP2-D (Figure 7).

ESTs corresponding to genes from the PLS1 family were
identified [see Additional file 2] in M. grisea (peritheciasexual fruiting bodies), T. reesei,B. cinerea (mycelia), S.
sclerotiorium (mycelia, sclerotia, and apothecia-sexual
fruiting bodies), Gibberella moniliformis (mycelia), P. anserina (perithecia-sexual fruiting bodies, germinating
ascospores, mycelia),C. cinerea (mycelia, sexual fruiting
bodies), P. chrysosporium (tissue undetermined) and L.
bicolor (free-living mycelia andmycorrhiza). In all these
fungi PLS1 genes are expressed, ruling out the possibility
that they correspond to pseudogenes. Indeed PLS1 cDNAs
of L. maculans, S. sclerotiorium and C. posadasii were
obtained by the screening cDNA libraries. qPCR expression profiling in M. grisea revealed that MgPLS1 mRNAis
expressed at similar levels in mycelia and perithecia (0.9 ×
reference constitutive gene ILV5, Figure 6) and in spores,
appressoria and infected barley leaves (0.5 × ILV5, Figure
6). In L. bicolor, PLS1 is constitutively expressed in all tissues analyzed (mycorrhizal symbiotic tissues, mycelia and
fruiting bodies, Figure 7).

Expression profiles of PLS1, TSP3, TPL1 in different
tissues from M. grisea. PLS1, TSP3, TPL1 expressions were
quantified by real-time RT-PCR using RNA extracted from
mycelia (M), spores (S), 24-h old appressoria (A) from P1.2
wild type strain, perithecia (P) from crosses between P1.2
(MAT1.2) and TH12 (MAT1.1) strains and 3-days old barley
leaves infected by P1.2 (I). PLS1, TSP3, TPL1 expressions were
calculated relative to the transcripts levels of the constitutively expressed gene ILV5 (MGG_01808.5) according to the
formulae: 2-ΔCt = 2-(CtgeneX-CtILV5). Each data point is the average of three biological replicates. Standard deviation is indicated by error bars. PLS1 is expressed in all tissues whereas
TSP3 and TPL1 are expressed in mycelia and perithecia.

The expression patterns of the different TSP2 genes in L.
bicolor were determined using genome wide long oligonucleotide microarrays (Figure 7). LbTSP2-A shows a barely
detectable expression level in contrast to LbTSP2-B,
LbTSP2-C and LbTSP2-D, which are expressed in all tissues
of L. bicolor. LbTSP2-B is highly expressed in mycorrhiza
and mycelia and at a lower level in fruiting bodies. Transcripts corresponding to LbTSP2-C are mainly found in
fruiting bodies, whereas LbTSP2-D is over-expressed in
mycorrhiza (Figure 7). ESTs corresponding to TSP2 were
found in P. chrysosporium, C. neoformans, C. cinerea (mycelia, sexual fruiting bodies) and L. bicolor (mycelia) suggesting that these genes are expressed in the corresponding
species.
ESTs corresponding to TSP3 were identified in G. zeae
(mycelia, infected wheat heads and perithecia-sexual
fruiting bodies), T. reesei (mycelia), Trichoderma harzianum (mycelia), B. cinerea (mycelia), S. sclerotiorium
(apothecia-sexual fruiting bodies) and A. niger (mycelia).

LbTSP2-C and LbTSP2-D are up-expressed in fruiting bodies
and in mycorrhiza, respectively.

ILV5) and mycelia (0.05 × ILV5), and negligible in spore
and appressoria (Figure 6). Spliced TSP3 transcripts were
detected by RT-PCR using mycelial RNA (data not shown)
suggesting that TSP3 is indeed expressed in mycelia,
although at a very low level.
ESTs for TPL1 were only identified in M. grisea and P. anserina [see Additional file 2]. Quantitative PCR expression
profiling in M. grisea revealed that MgTPL1 is overexpressed in perithecia and mycelia (0.4 × ILV5 and 0.3 ×
ILV5, respectively), but its expression is not detected in
spores and appressoria (Figure 6).
Functional analysis of TSP3 and TPL1 in M. grisea
The M. grisea deletion mutants of TSP3 and TPL1 were
obtained by targeted gene replacement in a P1.2Δku80::bar mutant background that increases the fre-

quency of homologous recombination [21]. Fifteen and
11 hygromycin-resistant transformants of TSP3 and TPL1,
respectively, were isolated andanalyzed by PCR for the
replacement of their wild-type alleles. Deletion mutants
were obtained with an efficiency of 100% (15/15) and
82% (9/11) for TSP3 and TPL1, respectively. Their mycelial growth and sporulation rates were similar to those of
P1.2-Δku80::bar (reference strain). These mutants were
inoculated on detached barley leaves using droplets of
conidial suspensions or on barley plants by spraying.
Mutants Δtsp3::hyg or Δtpl1::hyg caused foliar lesions identical in number, size and aspect to those induced by the
reference strain P1.2-Δku80::bar. The penetration frequencies of thesemutants on barley epidermis were similar to
those of wild type, suggesting that TSP3 and TPL1 are not
involved in pathogenicity on barley (Figure 8A). This
behavior differs from Δpls1 mutant which is non-pathogenic on barley [3]. These mutants were spray-inoculated
on two different rice cultivars compatible with M. grisea
isolate P1.2, Azucena (O. sativa japonica) with an intermediate level of partial resistance to M. grisea and CO-39 (O.
sativa indica) that is more susceptible to M. grisea than
Azucena. Quantitative analysis of leaf blast infection
revealed that the pathogenicity of Δtsp3::hyg and Δtpl1::hyg
deletion mutants is significantly reduced on both cultivars. On cv. Azucena, the Δtsp3::hyg and Δtpl1::hyg
mutants produced respectively less than 30% (z = 5, P =
0) and 35% (z = 4.6, P = 2.3 × 10-6) of the number of foliar
lesions induced by the P1.2-Δku80::bar reference strain
(Figure 8B). On cv. CO-39, the Δtsp3::hyg and Δtpl1::hyg
mutants produced respectively less than 55% (t = 3.2, P =
1.2 × 10-3) and 40% (z = 4.3, P = 8.6 × 10-6), respectively,
of the number of foliar lesions produced by the P1.2Δku80::bar strain (Figure 8B).
The up-regulation of TSP3 and TPL1 in perithecia suggested involvement of these genes in mating. To address
this question, the differentiation of perithecia and
ascospores was examined in crosses between wild-type
TH12 isolate and Δtsp3::hyg or Δtpl1::hyg mutants. A cross
between the P1.2-Δku80::bar mutant (phenotypically similar to the wild-type P12 isolate) and wild-type TH12 isolate was used as control. Production of perithecia was
monitored and three weeks after mating and those
ascospores were observed and then allowed to germinate.
No significant differences were observed in the fertility in
crosses between Δtsp3::hyg, Δtpl1::hyg and wild type M. grisea strains, indicating that these genes are not essential for
sexual reproduction.

Discussion
We have performed an exhaustive search for tetraspanins
in fungal genomes. In addition to expanding the previously described Pls1 [11] and Tsp2 tetraspanin families
[2], we have identified a new tetraspanin family (Tsp3)

were kept on water agar for 7 days under alternate day/night

that Δtsp3 and Δtpl1 mutants are still pathogenic on barley.

and a tetraspanin-like family (Tpl1). These gene families
display a different evolutionary history. An ancestral tetraspanin family specific to zygomycetes (RO3G_02583
and RO3G_14268 used as roots of the tree; Figure 5)
appears to be lost in higher fungi (basidiomycetes and
ascomycetes). The identification of a Tsp2 tetraspanin in
the zygomycete Rhizopus oryzae (RO3G_08988/RoTsp2-A
and RO3G_17009/RoTsp2-B) shows that this family is
ancient and predates the divergence between this phylum
and higher fungi. Pls1-encoding genes were identified in
almost all ascomycete and basidiomycete species. Their
absence in zygomycetes suggests that the Pls1 family is
more recent than the Tsp2 one (Figure 5). The Tsp3 and
Tpl1 families are restricted to ascomycetes suggesting a
more recent origin than the Pls1 and Tsp2 families. The
absence of tetraspanins in all hemiascomycete species suggests that these genes were lost early after the divergence
of these fungi from the other ascomycetes. In the Aspergilli,
the unique tetraspanin identified belongs to the Tsp3 family. Interestingly no tetraspanin genes were found in the
basidiomycete, U. maydis.
The Pls1 family is highly conserved in higher fungi and is
present as a single copy in each genome, defining a family
of orthologous genes. In phytopathogenic fungi, Pls1 is
essential for infection and is required for appressoriummediated penetration into host plant in three species (M.
grisea, B. cinerea,C. lindemuthianum). The corresponding
null mutants have appressoria that are unable to form
functional penetration pegs that direct the penetration of
the fungus into host plant [3,13,14]. These results support
the hypothesis that Pls1 tetraspanins are involved in a
conserved cellular function essential for appressorium
function. However, the existence of Pls1 in the human
ascomycete pathogen Coccidioides posadasii, in saprotrophic fungiand in symbiotic basidiomycetes such as
ectomycorrhiza suggests that Pls1 plays other cellular
roles than appressorium-mediated penetration of host tissues since these fungi do not differentiate appressoria. At
present, these functions of Pls1 remain unknown. In
fungi, functional studies are just beginning to be applied
to discover such functions. Furthermore, the presence of a
single copy of PLS1 in these fungal genomes offers an
advantage in deciphering its cellular functions, compared
to animals that have numerous tetraspanins with possible
functional redundancy [6].
The Tsp2 tetraspanins are highly conserved suggesting an
important functional role in most basidiomycetes
although it is curious that the Ustilago maydis genome
does not contain tetraspanins. Interestingly, this Tsp2
family is multigenic in L. bicolor and C. cinerea, which contrasts with other fungal tetraspanins families. Indeed, L.
bicolor displays four Tsp2 paralogs and C. cinerea contains
three Tsp2 paralogs. The functional significance of this

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/63

multigene family is unknown. The finding in L. bicolor
that LbTSP2B, LbTSP2C and LbTSP2D were expressed in
all analyzed tissues suggests that corresponding proteins
could be involved in the formation of a tetraspanin web,
as described in animals [6]. However, differential expression profiles were observed; LbTSP2B is over-expressed in
mycelia, LbTSP2C is over-expressed in fruiting bodies and
LbTSP2D is over-expressed in mycorrhiza. This tissue specific expression of Tsp2 tetraspanins may explain the
redundancy of this family.
Although TSP3 and TPL1 are over-expressed in perithecia,
no particular phenotype was observed in perithecia when
either of these genes was mutated. Perithecial production
after mating and ascospore germination were identical to
the wild type strain. No significant differences in the fertility were observed in crosses between Δtsp3::hyg,
Δtpl1::hyg and wild type M. grisea strains. In animals, analysis of mutants with deleted tetraspanins showed no effect
on development, but often had slightly altered phenotypes. For example, deletions of murine tetraspanin genes
led to a mild alteration of lymphocyte proliferation and
motility [6]. Even, in the Drosophilae the deletion of
about 25% of all tetraspanins does not affect viability or
fertility and results only in a transient defect in neuromuscular innervation during the larval stage [22]. M. grisea
may not be an appropriate model to characterize sexual
reproduction and anastomosis. Therefore, it would be
interesting to investigate the role of the TSP3 and TPL1
genes in other 'model' fungi such as N. crassa or P. anserina, which have large sexual fruiting bodies and higher
reproduction frequency, and thus may be more suitable to
analyze subtle phenotypes.
In M. grisea, the Δtsp3 and Δtpl1 mutants showed a significant reduction in pathogenicity only on rice. The rice cultivars used in this study are generally more resistant to M.
grisea compared to the barley cultivars. Thus, barley may
not be resistant enough to reveal differences in pathogenicity between the Δtsp3 and Δtpl1 mutants and a wild
type strain. Our findings show that TSP3 and TPL1 are
involved in the pathogenicity of M. grisea but have only a
quantitative effect on pathogenicity, in contrast to the loss
of pathogenicity caused by deletion of PLS1.

Conclusion
Higher fungi contain three canonical tetraspanin families:
the Pls1 family identified in ascomycetes and basidiomycetes, the Tsp2 family specific to basidiomycetes and the
Tsp3 family restricted to ascomycetes. Paralogs were only
identified within the Tsp2 family in the basidiomycetes C.
cinereus and L. bicolor. A tetraspanin-like family (Tpl1) was
also identified although only in ascomycetes. Our results

tional studies of fungal tetraspanins are limited to phytopathogenic fungi producing appressoria. The
function(s) of tetraspanin remain(s) unknown in saprophytic fungi, basidiomycetes and human pathogenic
fungi. Future functional study of tetraspanins in these
fungi may highlight other cellular roles than in appressorium-mediated penetration in host plants. Finally, the
role of tetraspanin-like proteins in fungi needs to be investigated in more depth. For example, the possibility of
functional interactions with canonical tetraspanins
should be assessed as observed in animals [23].

Methods
Bioinformatic analyses
Fungal proteins related to tetraspanins were identified
using the PF00335 motif [24] and HMMER package
[25,26]) to search fungal protein databases available at
[27-31]. ESTs were searched by Blastn of the corresponding tetraspanin encoding genes against public databases
available at NCBI [29], COGEME [32], Broad Institute
[27] or private EST databases (P. Silar, IGM, Orsay, France
for Podospora anserina; Laccaria bicolor database [33]; and
Bayer CropScience for Botrytis cinerea).
cDNA libraries
The PLS1 cDNA from S. sclerotiorum (isolate UQ1280-1)
was amplified by PCR using the degenerate primers T1b
and T3b [11] from appressorial cDNA prepared as
described by [34] and RACE (5' and 3') allowed the
sequence of full length transcripts to be acquired. The
complete sequence of PLS1 from L. maculans was derived
from a partial EST (DT932772) and by 5' and 3' RACE.
The RACE libraries (Invitrogen GeneRacer kit, CA) were
constructed using RNA extracted from mycelia grown for
four days on vegetable juice medium (10% Campbell's V8
juice, pH 6) in shaking cultures. To identify introns and
UTRs in the tetraspanin-encoding genes, BLAST2SEQ [29]
and ClustalW were used to align the genomic sequence of
each tetraspanin locus with available ESTs. The PLS1
cDNAs of C. posadasii were isolated by RT-PCR using total
RNA from mycelium of strain Silveira as a template. Oligos OAM770 (CGTGACATACCGCTGAATTG) and
OAM772 (TATTTGGAATCAACCGCCTC) were used to
amplify the cDNA, which was cloned into pGEM®-T Easy
(Promega) and sequenced. RT-PCR analysis of the
CpPLS1 gene using RNA isolated from in vitro grown parasitic phase spherules indicated that it was expressed at all
stages of spherulation, as well as during the mycelial
phase of the fungus. The various genes and their corresponding proteins are listed in [Additional file 5] and
[Additional file 6].

Transmembrane helices were predicted using the
TMHMM2.0 server [35,36]. The presence of the CCG-X-CX-C motif was sought in the large extracellular loop

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/63

(ECL2) of each protein. Protein sequences were aligned
with ClustalX 1.8 [37] and transferred to GenDoc for visualization [38]. Phylogenetic trees were constructed from
these alignments using the maximum likelihood method
and the PHYML software [39,40] and transferred to
Mega3.1 for visualization [41]. Bootstrap values were
expressed as percentage of 100 replicates.
Fungal strains, growth conditions and Δtsp3::hyg and
Δtpl1::hyg deletion mutants
Media composition, maintenance of M. grisea cultures,
transformation, and sexual crosses were as described by
[42,43]. M. grisea P1.2 and TH12 strains have been previously described [3,44], as has the P1.2-Δku80 strain [21].
Appressoria were differentiated on Teflon membranes
(FP301050 Goodfellow, Cambridge, U.K.). The Δtsp3 and
Δtpl1 mutants were constructed by targeted gene replacement of ORFs by a hygromycin resistance cassette as
described in [21]. The primers used in all experiments are
listed in [Additional file 7].
Microarray experiments in Laccaria bicolor
The Laccaria whole-genome expression array manufactured by NimbleGen (Madison, WI) contains in duplicates eight independent, non-identical, 60-mer probes per
whole gene model. Included in the microarray are 20, 614
annotated gene models (genome sequence v1.0), 1, 680
additional predicted gene models, 30, 000 random 60mer control probes and labeling controls. A manuscript
fully describing the array is in preparation. Free-living
mycelium of L. bicolor S238N was grown onto cellophanecovered agar plates containing Pachlewski medium, and
was grown for three weeks before harvesting the proliferating hyphal tips at the periphery. Ectomycorrhizas of L.
bicolor/Douglas fir and L. bicolor/Poplar were synthesized
in greenhouse experiments. In addition, ectomycorrhizas
of L. bicolor/Poplar were synthesized using an in vitro system. Fruiting bodies of L. bicolor S238N were collected
below Douglas fir seedlings grown in a greenhouse and
inoculated using L. bicolor S238N. Tissues were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and RNA extraction was
carried out using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen).
Total RNA preparations (two biological replicates for each
sample) were amplified using the SMART PCR cDNA Synthesis Kit (Clontech) according to the manufacterer's
instructions. Single dye labeling of samples, hybridization
procedures, data acquisition, background correction and
normalization were performed at the NimbleGen facility
(NimbleGen Systems, Reykjavik, Iceland) following their
standard protocol. Average expression levels were calculated for each gene from the independent probes on the
array and were used for further analysis. The complete
expression dataset is available as series GSE9784 at the
Gene Expression Omnibus at NCBI [45].

Expression profiling by real-time quantitative PCR
Total RNA was extracted from M. grisea mycelia, conidia,
mature appressoria (24 h), perithecia and infected barley
leaves using the hot acid/phenol protocol [46]. Mycelia
were derived from cultures grown in complete liquid
medium. Conidia from P1.2 strain were obtained on agar
rice medium. To differentiate appressoria, a conidial suspension (3.105 conidia/mL) supplemented with 10 μM
1,13-hexadecendiol was placed on Teflon membranes
(FP301050 Goodfellow, Cambridge, U.K.) and incubated
for 24 h at 26°C. Perithecia were obtained by crossing M.
grisea strains P1.2 and TH12. Reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) were performed
with 5 μg total RNA using the ThermoScript™ RT-PCR system kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer' s instructions. Real-time PCR experiments were
performed in 96-well plates using ABI-7900 (Applied Biosystems, USA). Primer pairs were designed using Primer
Express software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA)
with standard parameters (optimal melting point, 58°C;
optimal primer length, 20 bp; amplicon length, 101 bp).
cDNA dilutions of 10-3 and 10-2 were used respectively for
cDNA obtained from fungal tissues (mycelia, conidia,
appressoria, and perithecia) and infected barley leaves.
Standard conditions were used with SYBR green PCR Master mix (Applied Biosystem, 95°C for 10 min and 40
cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 60°C for 1 min and 72°C for 30
s). Gene expression was calculated relative to the transcripts levels of the constitutively expressed gene ILV5
(MGG_01808.5) using the formulae 2-ΔCt = 2-(Ctgene-CtILV5).
The accession numbers of fungal tetraspanins are indicated in [Additional file 5] and the real-time PCR primers
are listed in [Additional file 7].
Phenotypic analysis
Pathogenicity assays were performed using susceptible
barley cultivar Plaisant (Hordeum vulgare L.) and the susceptible rice cultivars Maratelli, LS1, Azucena and CO-39
(Oriza sativa). Conidia harvested from 10–14 day old cultures of M. grisea growing on rice agar were inoculated on
barley or rice plants. Barley seedlings were cultivated at
15°C with 60% humidity for 2–3 weeks. Segments (3 cm
long) from the barley leaves were placed on water agar
(1%) containing kinetin (2 mg.L-1), inoculated with 50
μL droplets of spore suspension (3 × 104 spores.mL-1) and
incubated at 26°C under a photoperiod of 12 hours light.
Leaf symptoms were recorded 7 days after inoculation.
Rice seedlings were cultivated for 20–30 days at 70% relative humidity and 25°C day/20°C night in a growth
chamber. Barley or rice (five and 160 plants per pot or
tray, respectively) were sprayed with spore suspensions
(20 mL of 3 × 104and 2.5 × 104 spores.mL-1, respectively)
containing 0.5% gelatin (w/v). Inoculated rice plants were
grown at 100% humidity for 24 h at 20–22°C in the dark
and subsequently transferred to a greenhouse at 23°C.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/63

Leaf symptoms were recorded 7 days after inoculation.
Quantitative analysis of leaf blast infection was carried on
30 leaves in two biological replicates. Mean number of
lesions per leaves were recorded. Statistical analyses were
carried out with Statbox Pro 6.5 (Grimmersoft, Paris,
France; Student and Mann-Whitney tests, threshold
alpha/2 = 0,025). The M. grisea penetration assays into
barley epidermal cells were performed as described in [3].
