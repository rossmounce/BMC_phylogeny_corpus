Abstract
Background: Hepatitis B core protein (HBVc) has been extensively studied from both a structural
and immunological point of view, but the evolutionary forces driving sequence variation within core
are incompletely understood.
Results: In this study, the observed variation in HBVc protein sequence has been examined in a
collection of a large number of HBVc protein sequences from public sequence repositories. An
alignment of several hundred sequences was carried out, and used to analyse the distribution of
polymorphisms along the HBVc. Polymorphisms were found at 44 out of 185 amino acid positions
analysed and were clustered predominantly in those parts of HBVc forming the outer surface and
spike on intact capsid. The relationship between HBVc diversity and HBV genotype was examined.
The position of variable amino acids along the sequence was examined in terms of the structural
constraints of capsid and envelope assembly, and also in terms of immunological recognition by T
and B cells.
Conclusion: Over three quarters of amino acids within the HBVc sequence are non-polymorphic,
and variation is focused to a few amino acids. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that core protein
specific forces constrain its diversity within the context of overall HBV genome evolution. As a
consequence, core protein is not a reliable predictor of virus genotype. The structural
requirements of capsid assembly are likely to play a major role in limiting diversity. The
phylogenetic analysis further suggests that immunological selection does not play a major role in
driving HBVc diversity.

Background
The evolutionary pressures that have driven Hepatitis B
virus (HBV) variation remain incompletely understood.
Using whole HBV genotype sequencing, this variability
can usefully be classified into at least eight families (genotypes) with a characteristic geographic distribution
(reviewed in [1]). Alternatively, HBV strains can be classified serologically on the basis of antibody to surface antigen (subtypes). These two classifications broadly

correlate, although some subtypes appear in more than
one genotype. The extent of genetic diversity reflects the
evolutionary history of the virus and the rate of genomic
mutation, as well as gene specific selection forces. Several
models of HBV evolution have been proposed (reviewed
in [2,3]) but fundamental parameters, such as the rate of
interspecies transmission or the rate of nucleotide mutation (the molecular clock) remain unresolved [3]. Nevertheless, it is generally assumed that the emergence of HBV

families may reflect adaptation to the genotype of the
prevalent human host population [4].
The clinical course of HBV infection is very variable. Acute
infections in adults are usually effectively controlled, but
occasionally lead to fulminant hepatitis and death. In a
proportion of individuals however, infection leads to
chronic viral replication, which can lead to severe liver
damage or hepatocellular carcinoma. Host factors including immune status clearly play a major role in determining clinical outcome. For example, perinatal transmission
leads to up to 90% chronic carriership, while the figure is
less than 10% for adults. However, pathogenicity has also
been linked to virus genotype and several different mechanisms have been proposed for this observation [5,6].
Sequence changes occurring during the course of infection
(longitudinal diversity) have also been extensively documented. One common example is the introduction of a
stop codon in the precore region which results in downregulation of secretion of a soluble form of HBV core protein (HBVe) whose function remains unclear [7,8].
Interestingly, the downregulation of HBVe secretion is
often associated with the appearance of anti-HBVe antibodies in serum, suggesting the protein itself may induce
some form of immunological tolerance [7,9].
The role of adaptive immunity both in determining the
course of HBV infection and in driving HBV evolution is
of special interest. Although pre-existing antibody to HBV
surface protein (HBVs) (for example in vaccinated individuals) clearly provides strong protection, antibody to
this antigen in natural infection is a late event, usually
subsequent to effective control for viremia. In contrast,
antibody to HBV core (HBVc), although this protein is
internal to the virion, occurs early in infection in almost
all infected individuals, irrespective of their ability to control viral replication [10]. T helper and cytotoxic responses
to several proteins of HBV have also been detected, and
the presence of a higher frequency of HBV specific CTL in
liver is associated with the ability to control viremia [11].
As might be predicted CTL responses are not limited to
structural proteins, but recognise several non-structural
viral proteins. Virus specific T cell immune responses are
most readily detected in individuals who effectively control viral replication. In chronically infected individuals,
these responses are often much more difficult to detect,
suggesting that the chronic state is associated with the
establishment of some form of immunological tolerance
[12].
HBVc antigen is a small protein, whose three-dimensional
structure has been determined by X-ray crystallography
[13], and whose immunogenicity in terms of both antibody and T cell responses has been studied rather extensively in both mouse and man. It thus represents an ideal

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/5/33

starting point for studies aimed at relating antigen structure to immune response. Indeed longitudinal studies on
small groups of HBV infected individuals have suggested
that variation is more common in B cell and T helper cell
epitopes, suggesting a possible immune driven escape
mechanism [14]. As a basis for further functional exploration we have documented HBVc variation in detail. In this
study we have collected several hundred protein
sequences of HBVc from public databases, and have reexamined variation in relation to structure, immunogenicity and genotype.

Results and discussion
742 protein HBVc sequences were retrieved from the
NCBI protein database after some manual curation of very
short sequence fragments. The mature HBVc protein
sequences 1–185 (not including the precore region) were
aligned and the number of polymorphisms found at each
position (defined as amino acids occurring in more than
1% of the sequences at each site) was determined (see
Additional file 1). A plot of the number of variants at each
position is shown in fig 1a and the major structural features, including the four alpha helices, the proline rich
loop and the C-terminal arm [13] of the protein are
shown in fig 1b. Over three quarters (141/185) of positions are completely invariant. Variation clustered within
certain regions of the protein, with 18 of the 45 variable
amino acids found within positions 59-100.
Sequence variation in core protein may reflect the overall
genotypic variation among HBV strains driven by drift or
other unknown factors ("hitchhiking"). Alternatively, specific selection pressures may operate on HBVc driving
diversity independently. In order to approach this question, the relationship between HBVc variation and HBV
genotype was explored. Using text querying of the data
base, a subset of 402 sequences were selected which had
been assigned genotype A-D (these were the most frequent assigned genotypes within this set) by analysis of
whole genome sequence or sequences outside the core
region. These 402 core protein amino acid sequences were
aligned and compared to each other and to the overall
consensus sequence using Protdist, a Phylip program
using the Jones-Taylor-Thornton model [15]. The distribution of distances between each sequence and the consensus was then plotted for each viral genotype as given in
the database record (fig 2). The distance distribution profiles of the different genotypes were largely overlapping,
suggesting that there was no correlation between distance
from consensus and genotype.
In an alternative approach, the relationship between all
the different core sequences was determined using FitchMargoliash least squares analysis, and plotted as an
unrooted tree (fig 3). The different genotypes of each virus

are colour coded. Although some broad clustering of genotypes was evident, a significant amount of "mixing" can
be observed. Similar qualitative results were obtained
when phylogeny was determined by Neighbour Joining
analysis (using Phylip program Neighbor) or by parsimony (using Phylip program ProtPars).
This phenomenon was analysed in more detail in a subset
of 40 full length core protein sequences selected from various sections of the tree illustrated in fig 3 (see Table 1).
The phylogenetic relationship between these forty
sequences was analysed again, using Neighbour-Joining
(a less computation intense method) incorporating a
1000 fold bootstrap replicate in order to validate the tree
topology. The results of this analysis are shown in fig 4a.
In this smaller subset, genotypes A and D are reasonably
well resolved, but genotypes B and C are extensively jumbled. One instance of this is illustrated by two identical
sequences (1 and 40 in fig 4) derived from genotypes B

and C respectively. The DNA sequences corresponding to
each of these forty protein sequences were then obtained
from GenBank, and analysed using the same bootstrapped Neighbour-Joining procedure. The tree obtained
is shown in fig 4b. As expected, the bootstrap values are in
general higher for the DNA tree (since three times as much
sequence information is being analysed). The DNA
sequences are somewhat more efficient at classifying B
and C as separate grouping. In particular the two identical
protein sequences (1 and 40 in figure) are well separated
and correctly classified by the DNA phylogeny. Overall,
however, significant misclassification remains, reflecting
either incorrect genotyping, recombination between viral
strains [16,17], or simply insufficient discrimination
based on these relatively short viral sequences.
Taken together, this data suggested the forces driving the
evolution of core were partially independent of the evolutionary forces driving diversification of overall genotype.

Figure 2
Relationship between HBVc sequence and genotype
Relationship between HBVc sequence and genotype. The 403 sequences from viruses of known genotype were aligned
and compared to the consensus. The distance of each sequence from the consensus was calculated using maximum likely-hood
model (Jones-Taylor-Thornton). The frequency distribution of distance from consensus was then plotted for each genotype AD.

The evolutionary pressures on sequence diversity were
analysed in more detail by analysing synonymous (S) /
nonsynonymous (N) nucleotide variation within the 40
viral sequences shown in Table 1. The overall distribution
pattern of synonymous /nonsynonymous mutation rates
is shown in fig 5a. The protein shows evidence of strong
purifying selection throughout the sequence, with dN/dS
ratios (using a sliding window of 36 base pairs) mostly
below 0.1, The apparent dS rate was not homogenous
along the length of the gene. The sharp decrease in substitution rate from around position 110 most likely reflects
the start of the overlapping open reading frame of the
polymerase, and this area was therefore excluded from
further analysis. The identification of site-specific positive
or neutral selection operating within an area of overall
purifying selection has received considerable attention
[18-21], and a number of methodologies have been
adopted. We applied maximum-likelyhood analysis as
implemented using Bayes Empirical Bayes method in the

software package PAML [22] and compared a number of
models of site-specific selection distribution [18]. The
best likelihood value was obtained using model 8 (see
Methods) which includes a positive selection subset. The
posterior probabilities for the positive (ω = 1.38) classes
are plotted in fig 5b. Interestingly, only one position
showed a probability of >90 of being positively selected,
with two more approaching 50% probability. In contrast
133 out of 140 codons showed a probability of >90% of
negative purifying selection. Thus there appears to be only
very limited amount of positive selection within the HBV
core sequence.
The sequence information in Additional file 1/fig 1 was
rationalised on the three dimensional structure of the capsid obtained from the Brookhaven Data Base. As evident
in fig 6 the variation in sequence is concentrated on the
spikes at the outer surface of the capsids. All the amino
acids with three or more variants are found on the outer

surface of the capsid (fig 6b upper panel) while the internal surface facing the capsid lumen are relatively conserved (fig 6b, lower panel).
A detailed alanine mutagenesis study has been carried out
mapping those amino acids critical to proper capsid formation, and/or required for envelopment and virion formation [23]. Mutation of 24 amino acids was found to
block capsid formation, virion formation or both. The
position of these mutations on the 3D structure is shown

in fig 7. The position of this set of mutations is quite
widely distributed over the structure, suggesting multiple
essential interactions are absolutely required either for
proper capsid assembly, or for envelope and virion assembly. However, interestingly, all but one of these 24 amino
acids were found to be invariant in the data set analysed
in this study. The only exception observed was at position
129, where changing proline to alanine was found to
block both capsid and virion formation. Both glutamine
and threonine are found in a proportion of virus
sequences at this position, and further mutagenesis will
be required to clarify the constraints imposed by the
requirements of virion formation on the sequence at this
particular position. Thus the structural requirements of
virion assembly seem to impose a significant restraint on
HBVc diversity. However, several positions which were
found to tolerate alanine mutagenesis in terms of capsid/
virion assembly were nevertheless invariant in the set of
sequences examined here. The overall high degree of conservation in HBVc therefore probably reflects the multiple
functions required from this protein, including control of
intracellular targeting [5], pregenome/DNA polymerase
packaging, capsid disassembly and viral maturation.
Pressure by the host immune system is one obvious candidate driving variation in the protein sequence of HBVc.
CD8 cytotoxic cells are believed to play a key role in controlling virus replication during HBV infection [24,25].
Several CD8 T cell epitopes have been characterised in
detail (e.g. [26-28]) by the use of T cell clones and lines or
by elution from HLA [29]. Some of the sequences are
shown in fig 7, together with the known variant sequences
in the dataset analysed in this study. Although several of
the epitopes lie within the more conserved inner region of
the capsid, two of the epitopes show substantial polymorphism (fig 8). Interestingly, a previous paper did not find
any evidence for emergence of mutations within the
major CD8 epitopes during chronic HBV infection [30].
The evidence implicating CD4 T cells in HBV control
remains much less clear. Furthermore, although regions
containing CD4 epitopes have been described, many of
the epitopes are not very well characterised. One putative
"immunodominant" CD4 T cell epitope (amino acids 5069) does contain a number of variable amino acids (fig
9a), and indeed changes in its sequence have been related
directly to changes in T cell response in vivo [31]. A second epitope (core region 147-156) identified as a major
target in HLADR13 individuals has also been examined in
some detail [32]. Interestingly this epitope also shows
considerable variation (fig 9a) including a mutation at
position 151 shown to be essential for T cell recognition.
The epitope also spans the region of a two amino acid
insertion which is found exclusively in viruses of genotype
A. Further detailed mapping of CD4 T cell recognition

ticularly since the capsid in intact virions is presumably
largely shielded from antibody by the HBV envelope.

Finally, considerable information has been accumulated
on the interaction of antibodies to HBV capsids. As shown
in fig 9b[10] the major defined antibody specificities lie
on the outside of the capsid structure, particularly at the
tip of the spikes and at the junctions between adjacent
spikes. These regions do indeed contain the majority of
the HBVc sequence variation, although the most variable
amino acids themselves have not been identified as
known antibody contacts [33]. However, the contribution
of anti-HBVc antibody to protection remains unclear, par-

Conclusion
This study makes use of the large number of HBVc
sequences now available in public databases to
characterise sequence variation in HBVc. One limitation
of such an approach is that detailed clinical information
associated with infection is not available, and in particular, it is not possible to examine variability in the context
of the longitudinal course of an HBV infection. This is
likely to be an important factor since mutations are often
found to arise late in infection, associated with a variety of

available sequences have been checked for their ability to
make competent infectious virus, and some sequences
may therefore represent non-functional proteins. However, despite these limitations, the data available does
allow some general conclusions.

Overall, HBVc contains a large proportion of invariant
amino acids, and a strong over representation of synonymous versus non-synonymous mutations at almost every
codon. Both features suggest the presence of strong constraining forces on sequence diversity. Virion assembly is
likely to provide one major constraining force [23]. As

Sequence variation in the context of capsid structure. The crystal structure formed by four HBVc subunits was displayed and coloured using RasMol software. Positions containing 2 polymorphisms are coloured blue, 3 polymorphisms are
coloured orange, and 4 or above are coloured red. Grey amino acids are invariant. a) The structure is displayed in ribbon form,
showing a vertical section though the capsid, with two spikes projecting upwards, and the internal face of the capsid shown at
the bottom of the picture. b) The structure is displayed in space fill. Upper Panel The structure is displayed so that the spikes
and outward surface of the capsid are shown towards the viewer, and only the outer surface of the capsid is visible. Lower
Panel The structure is rotated by 180 degrees so only the lower (inner) face of the capsid is visible.

reported previously (e.g. [14]) sequence diversity appears
to be clustered, and mapped predominantly to the spike
and external surface of the capsid. These positions may
allow greater flexibility in terms of virion assembly.

One significant consequence of the strong purifying selection is that protein sequence is a poor predictor of
genotype for this gene. DNA sequence which reflects predominantly synonymous mutations, is a better

Structural constraints and HBV diversity
Structural constraints and HBV diversity. The crystal structure formed by four HBVc subunits was displayed and coloured using RasMol software. The position of the amino acid identified as essential for virion formation (violet) or for both

Longer sequence analysis, however, is clearly necessary to
obtain reliable genotyping information.

determine more precisely the relationship between structure, immunity and pathogenicity.

Methods
The putative role of immune selection in driving HBV core
diversity is much more unclear. Direct evidence for positive selection, at least using the analysis presented here,
identifies only a single amino acid (position 74 at the tip
of the viral spike) as showing evidence for positive
selection of diversity. Nevertheless, it is clear that several
polymorphic positions lie within T or B cell epitopes.
Hence, while the overall effect of immune selection on
HBV sequence diversity may be small, sequence diversity
may have a significant effect on the immune response at
an individual level. The data analysis given here will help
inform further analysis of the HBV-specific immune
response. The combination of T cell and antibody recognition studies with directed mutagenesis of HBVc should

Human HBVc sequences were retrieved from the NCBI
protein sequence database [36], limiting the search to
organism = Hepatitis B virus and searching for core protein. Additional classification into genotypes A-D was
done using the text search tool to look for "genotype X".
A proportion of hits were verified by manual inspection.
The initial 780 hits were aligned using the EMMA program
on EMBOSS (a version of Clustal)(see[37] using the BLOSUM 62 similarity matrix. The alignment was further
refined by manual inspection using the sequence editor
Bioedit, and very short or badly aligned sequences
removed. The frequency of amino acids at each position
was determined using the EMBOSS program PROPHECY.

Variation within CD8 T cell epitopes of HBVc
Variation within CD8 T cell epitopes of HBVc. Five of the best defined class I T cell epitopes from HBVc (for references
see text) are shown together with alternative amino acids found at each position. The position of the epitopes (green) within
the HBVc three dimensional structure is shown in the right hand panel. The rest of the colour coding is as shown in fig 6.

The matrix observed was converted into polymorphism
frequency by setting a cut-off of 1% frequency at each
position.
A phylogenetic tree of the HBVc sequences was created
using the Phylip program Kitsch [38]), which uses a FitchMargoliash criterion based on a distance matrix obtained
using the Phylip program Protdist. The tree was displayed
using Treeview [39], copied in Adobe Illustrator and color
coded according to genotype. Because this method is
extremely processor intensive (the best tree is analysed at
each iteration) it was not possible to bootstrap. Analyses
of the same data were also done using nearest neighbor
analysis (using the Phylip program Neighbor) and parsimony using the EMBOSS (loc cit) program EPROTPARS.
Although the fine details of the trees varied between methods the overall qualitative conclusion were the same. In
order to further validate the conclusions of the phylogeny,
40 sequences (shown in Table 1) chosen manually to
cover the major branches of the tree shown in fig 3 were
reanalysed using the Nearest Neighbour with bootstrap

option (1000 bootstraps) of ClustalW [40]. The consensus tree set was plotted in Treeview and coloured in Illustrator. Similar analysis was carried out on an alignment of
the DNA sequences corresponding to each protein
sequence.
The analysis of synonymous/nonsynonymous mutations
rates was carried out initially using the program
DNASP3.0 [41] (using the Nei/ Gojobori algorithm) with
a 36 base pair sliding window shifted by 9 nucleotides. A
more detailed analysis at individual codons was carried
out using the program PAML version 3.14 (using maximum likelihood Bayes Empirical Bayes inference, as
described in [20]). Analysis was carried out using a variety
of selection models, but the output represented in fig 5
used model 8 [22]. The models assume that the selection
pressure (measured as ω) operating at each codon can fall
within a range of different classes. Model 8 assumes a distribution of negative selection values (for all of which ω
<1), or a positive selection class with ω = 1.38. This model
was found to give the best likelihood estimate. The pro-

shown in the context of the HBVc three dimensional structure above(in green). The rest of the colour coding is as shown in fig

The crystal structure of HBVc was retrieved as a pdb file
from the Brookhaven database, and displayed and coloured using RasMol software (version 2.7.1.1 for Windows). Figures 6 and 7 show the structure of four identical
monomers, to illustrate the spikes and their interaction,
while figs 8 and 9 show a single monomer for clarity.
