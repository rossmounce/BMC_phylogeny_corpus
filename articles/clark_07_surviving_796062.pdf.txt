Abstract
Background: Ice, snow and temperatures of -14°C are conditions which most animals would find
difficult, if not impossible, to survive in. However this exactly describes the Arctic winter, and the
Arctic springtail Onychiurus arcticus regularly survives these extreme conditions and re-emerges in
the spring. It is able to do this by reducing the amount of water in its body to almost zero: a process
that is called "protective dehydration". The aim of this project was to generate clones and sequence
data in the form of ESTs to provide a platform for the future molecular characterisation of the
processes involved in protective dehydration.
Results: Five normalised libraries were produced from both desiccating and rehydrating
populations of O. arcticus from stages that had previously been defined as potentially informative
for molecular analyses. A total of 16,379 EST clones were generated and analysed using Blast and
GO annotation. 40% of the clones produced significant matches against the Swissprot and trembl
databases and these were further analysed using GO annotation. Extraction and analysis of GO
annotations proved an extremely effective method for identifying generic processes associated with
biochemical pathways, proving more efficient than solely analysing Blast data output. A number of
genes were identified, which have previously been shown to be involved in water transport and
desiccation such as members of the aquaporin family. Identification of these clones in specific
libraries associated with desiccation validates the computational analysis by library rather than
producing a global overview of all libraries combined.
Conclusion: This paper describes for the first time EST data from the arctic springtail (O. arcticus).
This significantly enhances the number of Collembolan ESTs in the public databases, providing
useful comparative data within this phylum. The use of GO annotation for analysis has facilitated
the identification of a wide variety of ESTs associated with a number of different biochemical
pathways involved in the dehydration and recovery process in O. arcticus.

Background

Results and Discussion

The mechanisms by which organisms survive extreme low
temperatures are not only of interest to ecologists, but also
to a number of applied medical fields [1]. In this respect,
one of the most amenable and studied groups of organisms is the Collembola (arthropods or springtails) where
the physiological processes behind such survival are well
documented [2,3]. They possess three main strategies to
survive the cold: freeze tolerance, freeze avoidance or protective dehydration [3-5]. Whilst most springtails use
freeze avoidance, it is the latter strategy of protective dehydration in the Arctic springtail Onychiurus arcticus (Tullberg 1876) which is the subject of this study [5,6]. In
protective dehydration loss of water occurs across a diffusion gradient between the animal's super-cooled body fluids and ice in its surroundings, such that freezing point
depression always exceeds the environmental temperature
experienced, and eventually the animals lose sufficient
water to ensure that a freezing event cannot occur [5,6];
the animals desiccate. O. arcticus is widely distributed
throughout the northern parts of the Palaearctic region [710] and is found in moist habitats; mainly in mosses and
under large stones in the coastal areas of Svalbard, particularly on glacial outwash fans and under bird cliffs [11].
Studies have shown that O. arcticus, exposed to sub-zero
temperatures and low water vapor pressure induces extensive dehydration through a highly permeable cuticle
[5,12,13]. This is combined with the rapid synthesis and
accumulation of the membrane/protein cryoprotectant
trehalose from glycogen [13-15].

CDNA libraries construction and characterisation
Five libraries were produced from both desiccating and rehydrating populations of O. arcticus from stages that had
previously been defined as potentially informative for
molecular analyses [13].

Whilst there are a number of physiological and ecological
studies on this organism (detailed above), there have
been no molecular analyses to date (only O. groenlandicus
has been bar-coded: AY665335, AY6653316, AY665323).
This situation is not unusual, as the number of organisms
where there is even moderate amounts of sequence data
are severely limited. However, genomics is being increasingly applied to the study of non-model organisms and
ESTs are generally viewed as the most efficient and cost
effective strategy for the identification of genes and generating a first pass scan of a genome [16,17].
As part of a larger project examining over-wintering strategies in polar arthropods, we have generated 16,379 ESTs
for O. arcticus from 5 cDNA libraries of animals in different desiccation states. In this article we present the analysis of these library data. This represents the first sequence
data for this organism and significantly increases the
number of Collembolan ESTs in the databases from the
previous total of 8,686 produced from the springtail Folsomia candida [18].

• Library C: Controls
• Library D1: Desiccating: animals at -2°C. This is the critical temperature at which trehalose is significantly up-regulated at the expense of stores of glycogen.
• Library D2: Fully desiccated animals.
• Library R1: Animals that had been recovering for 8
hours.
• Library R2: Fully recovered animals.
For more detail, see methods. A total of 16,552 clones
were sequenced from the 5' direction. This was reduced
slightly to 16,379 clones after quality checks, each of
which had a minimum transcript size of 150 bp and an
average of 550 bp. Each library proportionally contributed between 17 and 23% of the total EST dataset (Table
1). The libraries were normalised to optimise the chances
of obtaining rare transcripts. Indeed, both gene diversity
and discovery ratios were high in all libraries, with a minimum diversity score of 79% (61% for all libraries) and
even the largest clusters comprising only approximately
0.4% of any one library (Table 1). When sequence similarity searches were run on the processed sequences, on average 40% produced significant matches (expect score in
excess of 1e-10 and therefore can be regarded as putative
known genes) against the sequence databases. This level
of gene identification is not surprising and recent EST data
generated from the springtail Folsomia candida (Timmermans et al, 2007) produced similar levels of BLAST identity. This is largely because there are a limited number of
insects that have been sequenced. The two main insects in
the ensembl database [19] are Drosophila melanogaster and
Anopheles gambiae, which are only related to O. arcticus at
the Super class level (Hexopoda). Of the two, A. gambiae
has most recently been sequenced and the VectorBase
genome build from June 2007 (AgamP3) produced only
10% known genes from a 10 fold genome sequence coverage of 278 Mb. Similarly recent EST data (in excess of
150,000 ESTs) from the silkworm (Bombyx mori) only provides confirmation of 15% of the predicted genes from the
WGS project [20-22].
The sequences from each library were further processed
using Blast2GO [23], but showed very similar compositions when defined in terms of their molecular function

Gene discovery is defined as the number of different "genes" each library contributed, divided by library size. Gene Diversity is defined as the
number of singletons in each library divided by library size [59].

(GO annotation level 2). An example of this output is
shown for all libraries in Figure 1, with the majority of
clones having either catalytic or binding activities.
Although the libraries were normalised, GOSSIP [24] was
used to perform statistical analyses using pair-wise comparisons of each library with the control library to identify
any potential enrichment for particular genes or gene
functions. No enrichment was found using the corrected
p-values of the False Discovery Rate, although there were
a number of significant single test p-values. For example
GO016860: intramolecular oxidoreductase activity and
GO008237: metalloexopeptidase activity were both elevated in the desiccated library compared to the control
with single test p-values of 0.05, these were not significant
using the False Discovery Rate. The problem with such
pair wise comparisons is that even though the comparative library was always the control animals, the GO categories listed for each pair wise comparison varied
considerably and it was not possible using this technique
to make global statements of certain molecular functions
being statistically enhanced in one library compared to
the others. These data do indicate that the normalisation
procedure in the library production process was relatively
effective.
GO annotation
The decision was made to analyse the libraries using GO
annotation rather than keyword extraction from Blast
comment lines, as GO categories are more generic than
gene names. This facilitates the comprehensive identification of gene sets associated with biochemical pathways
without in-depth knowledge of individual pathway com-

ponents and also where potentially multiple pathways
exist for a particular process (cf. trehalose [25]). In the following discussion PGO refers to a Biological Process GO
annotation; FGO is Molecular Function and CGO is Cellular component.
Initially the focus of the searches concentrated on general
processes such as response to water, water deprivation,
abiotic stimulus, desiccation and Qdrought recovery. Disappointingly only 11 clones were identified from the five
libraries, but even so, these did include some clones of
further interest. PGO:0009414, response to water deprivation identified a putative aquaporin (the same clones
were also identified under a specific GO search for
aquaporin) and PGO:0009415, response to water, produced ESTs with matches to dehydrin which is induced in
response to water stress in plants, the latter of which
would not have been identified using extraction of Blast
keyword data. Given the relative lack of success of the
generic searches, specific genes and pathways were targeted. Of the genes present in the libraries, there was particular interest in identifying the following genes:
• The trehalose and glycogen pathways (as trehalose is
produced from glycogen during the desiccation process)
[25].
• Aquaporins: 6 transmembrane domain proteins
involved in water transport [26,27].
• Genes involved in cell protection, such as antioxidants

• Genes involved in moulting, as moulting has previously
been implicated in lowering the supercooling point and
survival ability of Antarctic springtails (Cryptopygus antarcticus) [28,29].
• LEA (Late Embryogeneis Abundant) proteins, which
have been shown to be involved in desiccation in a
number of organisms [30].
Trehalose and glycogen pathways
Initially the trehalose pathway was screened only for the
GO molecular functions directly associated with it, but
this revealed very few matching clones, with only 3 clones
for FGO:0003825 (alpha, alpha-trehalose-phosphate synthase (UDP-forming) activity, none for FGO: 0015574
(trehalose transmembrane transporter activity) and 3 for
FGO:0004805 (trehalose-phosphate activity) (Table 2).
Because of the redundancy in levels of GO annotation, all
six clones identified by the molecular processes matched
the same gene: trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (probability and expect scores in excess of 493, 1.6 e-44). A similar
situation occurred when identifying genes involved in the
glycogen pathway, in that a number of clones were identified (137 in total), but many were to the same gene: glycogen phosphorylase which breaks up glycogen into
glucose subunits.

Further analysis was carried out on the trehalose pathway
by expanding the search to the biological process
PGO:0005991 (trehalose metabolic process). This produced 19 matches in total. In-depth analysis of these
revealed matches to trehalose-6-phosphate synthase, trehalase precursor and a number of different protein
kinases (Table 3). These included a serine-threonine protein kinase from the yellow fever mosquito, which in
humans is involved in phosphorylation and protein
kinase A cAMP-dependant catalytic subunit from the same
organism. Phosphorylation is an integral process in trehalose biosynthesis and degradation, so protein kinases are
certainly involved. The question is, which ones? The GO
annotations, whilst largely based on mammalian data,
provide immediate candidates for further analysis, which
would not have been identified using screening of Blast
outputs using specific keywords for the trehalose pathway
enzymes. It is interesting to note that libraries produced
from control animals did not contain any matches to trehalase activity, which is associated with the breakdown of
trehalose. However, this is to be expected as biochemical
studies indicate that trehalose is largely absent in control
animals and that it is only produced in response to the
desiccation process [13]. Also that the libraries prepared
from the desiccated animals contained the highest
number of potential matches to trehalose synthesis GO

annotations, which is where it is expected that most trehalose would be produced.
Aquaporins
These proteins are associated with water transport across
membranes (Kruse et al, 2006) and have the GO annotation: FGO:0015250: water channel activity. Searches of all
libraries revealed 7 clones in total (4 singletons and a cluster of 3) matching three potentially different aquaporin
genes:

• Q0IG28: Aquaporin 1 from Aedes aegypti. Two clones
from control and desiccating libraries (C and D1),
matches in excess of P value = 177, expect value = 9.7e-12.
• Q9NHW7: Aquaporin AQPAe.a from Aedes aegypti.
Two clones from desiccated and recovering libraries (D2
and R2), matches in excess of P value = 512, expect value
= 3.2 e-47
• UniRef100 000051A00B: Predicted similar to Drip
CG9023_PB isoform B Apis mellifera. 1 cluster of 3 genes
from the desiccated library (D2) with a match of P value
= 480, expect value = 7.7 e-44
Translation of the individual clones and alignments confirmed that three different aquaporin genes had been
cloned (Figure 2A) with a maximum of 49.4% amino acid
identity between clones when compared over identical
lengths (Figure 2B). The clones were all around 200
amino acids in length, which is approximately 80% of the
expected length of an aquaporin gene. All clones included
5 complete transmembrane (TM) domains with TM6
present in sb_006_05H07 and partial in the two other

clones. All three contained the classical footprint of
aquaporins: two NPA motifs, cysteine 181 was not conserved and only CL138 had the consensus site for Nlinked glycosylation. The consensus site for phosphorylation by protein kinase C was not present in any of the
clones [31]. Homology between the clones was relatively
low at a maximum of 49.4%, but not surprising as homology within aquaporins is generally low. For example the
maximum homology between the latest aquaporin identified in mouse (AQP12) with the other mouse AQPs is
38.9% [32]. When the 328 bp sequence from exon 1 of
the gene for aquaporin-2 was compared in 12 mammalian species, only 14 out of 109 amino acids were conserved throughout the mammalian aquaporin family, of
these 13 were conserved in the springtail AQPs (Figure
2A). Identity of the springtail clones was confirmed by
phylogenetic analysis (Figure 3). All three clones clustered
with the other insect aquaporins extracted from the database. Interestingly all insect clones clustered more
strongly with the aquaglyceroporins, AQP8, the putative
ancestral molecule [27] and AQP 11 and 12. Relatively little is known about the latter two genes, but the human
AQP12 is hypothesised to play a novel intracellular role in
digestive enzyme secretion [32]. Limited functional analysis has been carried out on the insect aquaporins, but evidence points toward them being designated as classical
water channel molecules [33,34]. Cicadella viridis AQPcic
has been shown to increase osmotic membrane water permeability when expressed in Xenopus oocytes and the
Aedes aegypti AQP (Accession number: Q9NHW7) gene
was localised to tracheolar cells associated with malpigian
tubules and therefore it was hypothesised that this protein
played a role in the removal of tracheolar fluid during respiration.

Database matches for "genes" identified from GO annotations for both the metabolic function and biological processes associated with trehalose
metabolism. Matches to the databases are shown with probability and expect values. Organism names are shown with the common name at first
annotation.

Cell protection
A general search for the level 2 GO annotation
FGO:0016209 revealed 42 potential clones with antioxidant activity from all 5 libraries. However because of the
complexity of the GO annotation network, further
searches were carried out for level 3 molecular functions
and biological processes under specific functions: hydrogen peroxide, melanin, catalase, superoxide dismutase,
glutathione, glutathione transferase and glutathione
reductase (Table 4). These identified a greater number of
clones (387), many of which were duplicated between the
libraries (data not shown). It is interesting to note that the
highest number of antioxidant clones were present in
both the desiccating and desiccated libraries (D1 and D2).
From the percentages of clones present in each library for
each antioxidant, the major components would appear to
be glutathione, catalase and hydrogen peroxidase, with
melanin and superoxide dismutase playing minor roles.
Moulting
Processes involved in the survival of insects at low temperatures include the removal or deactivation of ice nucleat-

ing agents, accumulation of cryoprotectants and thermal
hysteresis proteins [35-38]. Moulting has recently been
shown to be associated with reduction of the supercooling
point (SCP) and hence cryoprotection in Antarctic springtails (Crypotpygus antarcticus) [28,29]. This might be
expected to depress the SCP, because in Collembola the
mid-gut and its entire contents are shed during moulting
[39] resulting in the expulsion of potential ice nucleators
in the animal gut. The physiology and timing of moulting
in O. arcticus has not been documented to date, although
with a rigid exoskeleton they clearly moult regularly in
order to grow. So genes and pathways involved in moulting were also investigated using GO annotations (data not
shown). A number of relevant genes were identified for
both juvenile hormone (a pleiotropic hormone, which in
concert with ecdysteroids orchestrates moulting and metamorphosis and may be involved in reproduction in some
species) and members of the ecdysone pathway. The latter
included the ecdysone receptor and the protein ultraspiracle (XR2C) chorion factor. In addition to a considerable
number of putative transcription factors and chromatin
remodelling subunits were identified. It was interesting to

note that more matches were found in the actively desiccating (D1) and recovering animals (LIBs R1 and R2) (10,
24 and 14 respectively, total = 48) compared to only 8 in
the control and 5 in the desiccated populations. Thus
indicating that moulting may either play a role in the des-

iccation process, or potentially is triggered in some animals by the cellular stress involved in desiccation and
recovery. We are currently investigating the role of moulting in desiccation of O. arcticus using a biochemical test
for 20-hydroxy ecdysone and are also actively collecting

ferent species reveals only 53.5% identity between two
cereal crops (Q42376: LEA3, maize and Q03968: LEA3,
wheat), which reduces dramatically to 27.2% between different phyla such as chick pea and nematode (O49816
and Q95V77 respectively). Even the 11 amino acid repeat
unit, which is a feature of LEAs shows little conservation
with only 1 or 2 identical amino acids between chick pea
and the nematode Aphelenus avenae. Searches of the O.
arcticus BLAST annotations revealed a cluster of two clones
present in Library D2 (desiccated animals) and a single
clone in Library D1 (desiccating animals). This is exactly
where such genes would be expected if they were involved
in the desiccation process. Translation of all three clones
and alignments indicated that only one gene was present.
The primary BLAST match results for this clone against the
databases were to Q1DH19, a putative uncharacterised
protein from the yellow fever mosquito. After a number of
subsequent matches to uncharacterised insect proteins,
there were then matches to abhydrolase genes and LEA
proteins (Oryza sativa) with probability and expect scores
for the latter of 179 and 6.4e-11 (Figure 4). At the amino
acid level, identities were low with the best match to the
uncharacterised protein showing 45% identity and the
LEA protein, 31%.

animals that have either just moulted or are in the process
of moulting for more detailed molecular analysis.
Lea proteins
Of the genes and pathways under investigation, only LEA
proteins were without GO annotations. So a search was
made of the ESTs using Blast annotations. Identification
of LEAs is problematical as these proteins are not highly
conserved [30]. Comparison of LEA proteins between dif-

Database searches of LEA proteins can produce matches to
abhydrolase genes (as happened with this clone), due to
the presence of an abhydrolase domain (denoted in Figure 4). Abhydrolases are a largely uncharacterised protein
family, but members of this family do contain domains
with hydrolase activity and therefore could potentially be
involved in desiccation biochemistry. Phylogenetic analysis of the O. arcticus translated gene fragment suggests that
this fragment most closely matches the ABHD_A (or
ABHD_10) abhydrolase domain (data not shown). The
question remains, is this clone sb_009_02E03 an LEA or
an abhydrolase? This is virtually impossible to answer
with short sequence fragments and the answer may
become apparent with the full-length sequence, the cloning of which by RACE PCR is now underway. Also Western blotting studies are being carried out on O. arcticus
using heterologous probing of a LEA antibody to identify
such proteins via an alternative route.
Differences between the libraries
All libraries were normalised during the construction
process and therefore in-depth expression analysis was
difficult. The primary aim of this EST production was to
produce clones for a microarray and therefore normalisation was considered the best option for maximising gene
discovery. However, lack or gain of gene expression could
be inferred by presence or absence in some libraries. Certainly some GO annotations revealed similar distributions and levels of function across all libraries. But where
very specific enzyme reactions or genes were identified

clones for each antioxidant is shown along with the relative percentage that they comprise of the total antioxidant clones identified in each library.

some differences between libraries could be discerned
using a plus/minus system cf. aquaporins and putative
LEAs, as discussed above (Table 5). The identification of
candidate genes for involvement in the desiccation process and some generalised differential expression between
libraries has to be further verified using more comprehensive laboratory analyses such as RACE PCR to obtain fulllength clones, microarrays and Q-PCR.

Conclusion
This paper describes, for the first time, EST data from the
arctic springtail (O. arcticus), significantly enhancing the
number of Collembolan ESTs in the public databases.
40% of the clones produced significant matches against
Swissprot and trembl and these ESTs were further analysed using GO annotations. This facilitated the identification of genes involved in biochemical pathways of
interest, such as trehalose biosynthesis and moulting. The
GO annotations produced a greater range of potential
"genes" for further investigation and was more effective at
identifying genes in a particular pathway than could have
been identified using extraction of data from Blast. Candidate genes involved in the desiccation process were identified including three members of the aquaporin family
and a putative LEA protein. These genes are under further
investigation. The GO annotations identified in this publication will be used to automatically extract EST clone ids

from in-house produced insect libraries to target further
investigations into over-wintering survival of insects in
extreme environments. This will include construction of
customised microarrays.

Methods
Sample collection and preparation
Onychiurus arcticus, were collected under the bird cliffs at
Stuphallet and Krykkefjellet on the Brøggerhalvøya, near
Ny Ålesund, Spitsbergen, Svalbard, Norway (78°56'N,
11°53'E) and transported to the British Antarctic Survey
(BAS), Cambridge, for analysis. Animals (mixture of both
adult and juveniles) were cultured in ventilated plastic
boxes containing moss, lichen and soil taken from field
sites and fed on dried baker's yeast. Cultures were kept
moist at +4°C.

Five groups of animals were prepared for library production:
• Library C: Controls: live animals which were kept in a
+4°C cabinet
• Library D1: Desiccating: animals were cooled for two
weeks from +2 to -2°C in culture pots containing a base
of wet plaster of Paris/charcoal at a rate of 2°C per week.

All groups of animals were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80°C until required.
Library construction
Total RNA was extracted from frozen (-80°C) samples of
O. arcticus using TRI Reagent (Sigma) according to manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized and normalized using a combination of the Trimmer-Direct kit
(Evrogen, Moscow, Russia) and the SMART cDNA Library
Construction kit (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo-Alto,
CA) according to the protocol from Evrogen [40]. Modifications to the protocol were made concerning the columns used for size selection and the cloning vector: to
improve clone size selection Chroma spin 1000 were used
instead of Chroma spin 400 (both BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo-Alto, CA) and pal32 (Evrogen, Moscow, Russia)
was used for directional cloning with insertion between
two SfiI sites (GGCCATTACGGCCGGG del(CATGTC)
GGCCGCCTCGGCC. This procedure was chosen because
of the low amount of starting material [41] and the normalisation process increased the efficiency of rare transcript discovery [42,43]. Plasmids were transferred via
electroporation to Escherichia coli (strain DH10B, Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany).
cDNA Sequencing
Plasmids were isolated according to the method of [44]
and 5'end sequenced using Dye Terminator Chemistry
version 3.1 (ABI, Weiterstadt, Germany) and 3730XL ABI
capillary sequencer systems (ABI, Weiterstadt, Germany).

Sequence analysis and EST clustering
Sequence fasta files were processed using the script
Trace2dbest [45], which incorporated the phred [46,47]
and crossmatch (P. Green, unpublished) programmes. A
minimum cut-off value of 150 bp was applied after quality control processing for sequence database searching
and for generating the submission file for dbEST [48]
(Accession numbers, dbEST: 49109381–49125759, Genbank: EW744731–EW761109). Tgicl [49] was used for
clustering the fasta files, incorporating quality scores, for
each of the five libraries, as well as for all the libraries
together. The clusters were database searched using Blastx
[50] against the Uniprot/Swissprot and Uniprot/Trembl
databases [51] (at 12/06/2007), with matches annotated
for all scores with an expect score in excess of 1e-10.
Sequences with a database match were then further annotated using GO [52] (at 24/07/2007). Another view of the
data was generated by Blast2GO [23] using the nonredundant (nr) database [53]. With the Blast2Go annotation, the programme GOSSIP [24] was run to identify any
enrichment for GO annotations between the libraries.
Sequence manipulation was carried out using the
EMBOSS suite of programmes [54]. Sequences were clustered using ClustalW [55] and then subjected to phyloge-
