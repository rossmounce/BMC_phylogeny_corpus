Phylogenetic analysis of ferlin genes reveals
ancient eukaryotic origins

Abstract
Background: The ferlin gene family possesses a rare and identifying feature consisting of multiple tandem C2
domains and a C-terminal transmembrane domain. Much currently remains unknown about the fundamental
function of this gene family, however, mutations in its two most well-characterised members, dysferlin and
otoferlin, have been implicated in human disease. The availability of genome sequences from a wide range of
species makes it possible to explore the evolution of the ferlin family, providing contextual insight into
characteristic features that define the ferlin gene family in its present form in humans.
Results: Ferlin genes were detected from all species of representative phyla, with two ferlin subgroups partitioned
within the ferlin phylogenetic tree based on the presence or absence of a DysF domain. Invertebrates generally
possessed two ferlin genes (one with DysF and one without), with six ferlin genes in most vertebrates (three DysF,
three non-DysF). Expansion of the ferlin gene family is evident between the divergence of lamprey (jawless
vertebrates) and shark (cartilaginous fish). Common to almost all ferlins is an N-terminal C2-FerI-C2 sandwich, a
FerB motif, and two C-terminal C2 domains (C2E and C2F) adjacent to the transmembrane domain. Preservation of
these structural elements throughout eukaryotic evolution suggests a fundamental role of these motifs for ferlin
function. In contrast, DysF, C2DE, and FerA are optional, giving rise to subtle differences in domain topologies of
ferlin genes. Despite conservation of multiple C2 domains in all ferlins, the C-terminal C2 domains (C2E and C2F)
displayed higher sequence conservation and greater conservation of putative calcium binding residues across
paralogs and orthologs. Interestingly, the two most studied non-mammalian ferlins (Fer-1 and Misfire) in model
organisms C. elegans and D. melanogaster, present as outgroups in the phylogenetic analysis, with results
suggesting reproduction-related divergence and specialization of species-specific functions within their genus.
Conclusions: Our phylogenetic studies provide evolutionary insight into the ferlin gene family. We highlight the
existence of ferlin-like proteins throughout eukaryotic evolution, from unicellular phytoplankton and apicomplexan
parasites, through to humans. We characterise the preservation of ferlin structural motifs, not only of C2 domains,
but also the more poorly characterised ferlin-specific motifs representing the DysF, FerA and FerB domains. Our
data suggest an ancient role of ferlin proteins, with lessons from vertebrate biology and human disease suggesting
a role relating to vesicle fusion and plasma membrane specialization.

Background
The ferlin family of genes in humans and most mammals is composed of six members, and possesses a distinct topology of tandem C2 domains (ranging from
four to seven), with a single C-terminal transmembrane
domain [1]. The ferlins were identified and named
based on homology to a Caenorhabditis elegans spermatogenesis factor Fer-1 [2]. C. elegans Fer-1 mutants are

infertile due to defective fusion of membranous organelles with the spermatozoan plasma membrane [3].
There are six mammalian ferlins (Fer1L1-6), with mutations in FER1L1 (dysferlin) and FER1L2 (otoferlin)
linked to inherited diseases in humans [4,5]. Mutations
in dysferlin underlie an autosomal recessive form of
muscular dystrophy (limb girdle muscular dystrophy
type 2B, LGMD2B and the allelic disorder Miyoshi myopathy) [4]. Mutations in oterferlin cause an autosomal
recessive form of non-syndromic deafness (DFNB9) [5].
Dysferlin deficient mouse muscle fibers fail to perform

calcium-dependent membrane resealing [6], a process
thought to involve fusion and exocytosis [7,8] or endocytosis [9] of repair vesicles at sites of injury. Otoferlin
null mice show a primary defect in calcium-mediated
synaptic vesicle fusion and exocytosis at the synapse of
cochlear inner hair cells [10]. FER1L3 (myoferlin) has
not yet been linked to human disease, but studies of the
myoferlin null mouse demonstrate impaired myoblast
fusion and myofiber formation during development and
regeneration [11]. Thus, emerging evidence points
towards a common vesicular trafficking and fusion role
for ferlin proteins, with unknown roles and tissue specificity for mammalian ferlins FER1L4, FER1L5 and
FER1L6.
The occurrence of multiple tandem C2 domains that
typify the ferlin family are rare. Only two other vertebrate gene families contain three or more C2 domains;
the MCTP proteins (multiple C2 domain and transmembrane region proteins) [12] and E-Syt (extended
synaptotagmins) [13]. As an independent folding unit,
C2 domains represent a functionally diverse and widely
distributed calcium-binding motif. They are classically
observed to function as calcium-dependent lipid binding
modules [14], but some C2 domains have lost their calcium sensing ability and instead specialize in proteinprotein interactions to regulate membrane trafficking
and signal transduction [15]. Solved structures of C2
domains reveal a beta-sandwich fold consisting of eight
antiparallel beta-strands connected by highly variable
surface loops [16]. A key feature of calcium binding C2
domains is the conservation of calcium binding loops
clustered on one end of the sandwich which are composed of negatively charged (usually aspartate) groups
responsible for the coordination of multiple calcium
ions [15]. In addition to influencing electrostatic potential to enhance phospholipid binding [17], the residue
composition of this loop region also influences phospholipid selectivity, which allows for specificity of their
target membranes [18].
Despite much effort dedicated to structurally and
functionally characterize proteins with singly occurring
C2 domains, not much is known regarding the purpose
and function of multiple (greater than two) C2 domains.
Should they be viewed as multiple instances of similarly
functioning calcium binding units, maintained for efficiency or redundancy purposes? Or perhaps cross-talk
and synergy between adjacent C2 domains gives rise to
a more complex additive function beyond the classic
role of C2 domains? Interestingly, sequence analysis and
comparison of C2 domains within a single ferlin member reveal great diversity; where each domain is more
similar to its corresponding counterpart in paralogs
[19], indicating duplication from a common ancestral
gene and evolution of specialized functions.

Another domain of interest subject to sequence analysis in this study is the DysF domain, which is present in
only certain members of the ferlin family, and also in
yeast peroxisomal proteins where its established function is to regulate peroxisome size and number [20].
This domain is of particular interest in understanding
ferlin involvement in disease, as numerous disease-causing mutations in dysferlin have been mapped to both
the inner and outer portions of the DysF domain. The
DysF domain exists as an unusual nested repeat in ferlin
proteins, where its function currently remains unestablished. The structure of the inner portion of the myoferlin DysF domain was recently solved, and shown to
consist of two long antiparallel beta-strands. It has been
suggested that preservation of function of both portions
is likely, given that the insertion of the inner DysF
domain occurs in an intervening loop region connecting
the two beta-strands of the outer DysF domain, allowing
both repeats to adopt the same fold without disruption
to secondary structures [21]. In this study we present
sequence analysis of the DysF domain of the ferlins,
important for categorising and obtaining functional
clues to this family of proteins.
The increasing availability of whole genome sequences
and the annotation of genes from a wide range of phyla
enables phylogenetic analysis of gene families to provide
important contextual insight into their present day form
and association with human disease. In this study, we
report the phylogenetic analysis of the ferlin gene family,
where we have retrieved ferlin genes from single-celled
protists through to a range of metazoan species. We
explored the diversity of ferlin domain topologies within
this gene family, and examined the level of conservation
of both C2 and non-C2 domain elements. The identification of both a DysF and non-Dysf ancestral ferlin in
early metazoan species, and their expansion during vertebrate evolution, suggests a fundamental role associated
with this ancient gene family that has specialized to
include tissue-specific and isoform-specific functions.
Sequence analysis within the ferlin protein family has
thus far been limited to studies in higher vertebrates
[19,22] with the exception of C. elegans [3]. In this
manuscript we extend ferlin sequence analysis to
include ferlin family members from eight metazoan
phyla and three single-celled protists, some of which
were derived from draft genomes.

Methods
Identification and annotation of unannotated ferlin genes

The ferlin genes for species within the Drosophila and
Caenorhabditis genus and the unidentified mouse
Fer1L5 was obtained by TBLASTN [23] searches against
their respective databases. In most cases the ferlin gene
was fully contained within a supercontig (or scaffold)

Lek et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:231
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/231

and segment pairs were in close proximity to each other.
The exons and exon boundaries were identified from
the TBLASTN output as high scoring segment pairs or
gaps within these segment pairs. In addition, exons were
checked for correct ordering and strand. All hits were
then manually analyzed for splice acceptor and donor
sites to ensure the correct exon-intron boundaries.
Finally, multiple sequence alignment using MAFFT was
performed to ensure there were no gaps amongst orthologs from the Drosophila and Caenorhabditis genus.
Domain classification

The locations of C2, DysFN, DysFC and transmembrane
domains within ferlin genes were detected using
SMART [24]. The location of FerI, FerA and FerB
domains were detected using Pfam [25]. The program
MAFFT was used to do multiple sequence alignments
of DysFN, DysFC, FerA and FerB from various orthologs
and paralogs [26]. CHROMA was used to highlight patterns in the resulting multiple sequence alignments [27].
Secondary structure prediction was performed using
domains from human sequences as input into the Jnet
secondary structure prediction server[28]. The resulting
output was overlayed on the multiple sequence alignment generated for each domain.
The pair-wise sequence identity of C2 domains was
determined using needle, a global alignment tool within
EMBOSS [29]. Conservation of calcium-binding residues
(aspartates and glutamates) were determined by alignment with C2A of Synaptotagmin 1 [Uniprot: P21579]
for which key aspartates have been experimentally determined [30].
Maximum likelihood trees

The program ClustalW2 [31] with default settings was
used to perform multiple sequence alignment to use as
input for PHYML. The phylogenetic trees based on protein sequences were generated using the maximum likelihood method employed by PHYML 3.0 [32] using a Le
and Gascuel (LG) amino acid based model with estimated proportion of invariable sites and bootstrapping
(100 replicates).

no ferlin-specific domains amongst the prokaryotes.
Results from maximum likelihood tree analysis reveals
evolutionary partitioning of the ferlin protein family
into two major subgroups (Figure 1); DysF-containing
ferlins (Type I ferlins, blue shading) and non-DysF ferlins (Type II ferlins, orange shading). Metazoans typically have one or more ferlin of each subgroup.
Invertebrates generally have two ferlin genes (Nematoda and Arthropoda being exceptions, see below), one
belonging in the non-DysF subgroup, and the other to
the DysF subgroup, forming branching patterns similar
to their evolutionary distance (i.e Tadh, Lgig, Ccap,
Sman, Nvec; see Table 1). Two Dysf-containing ferlin
sequences were evident in the invertebrate placozoan
Trichoplax adhaerens (Tadh Fer1L1 and Fer1L3), which
most likely result from a tandem duplication event (in
scaffold 8), resulting in their close branching within the
DysF subgroup.
Nematoda and Arthropoda were noted exceptions to
DysF-containing and non-DysF subgrouping. Nematodes
(round worms) possess only DysF-containing ferlins (see
also Figure 2). Phylogenetic analysis of ferlin sequences
from two nematode species, C. elegans (Cele) and Brugia malayi (Bmal) form their own subgroup, clustering
to neither Fer1L1/3/5 nor Fer1L2/4/6 subgroups, suggesting sequence divergence of ferlin proteins within the
nematode phylum. C. elegans also has a closely related
duplicate gene, Fer1L1, a truncated version of Fer1 lacking several C-terminal C2 domains and the transmembrane domain (see Figure 2).
Arthropoda possess only non-Dysf ferlins. Moreover,
the Drosophila ferlin gene, Misfire (DmeI), is an outlier
within the non-DysF subgroup, and does not cluster
with ferlin sequences from other arthropods (Phum,
Tcas, Apis, Cqui, see Table 1), despite having close evolutionary distance.
Vertebrates encode six ferlin proteins [19], with three
in each Dysf subgroup. Vertebrate DysF-containing ferlins (Figure 1, blue box) then generally partition into
Fer1L1-like (dysferlin), Fer1L3-like (myoferlin) and
Fer1L5-like orthologs. Similarly, non-DysF ferlins generally cluster into orthologs of Fer1L2 (otoferlin), Fer1L4
and Fer1L6.

Results
Evolutionary relationship of ferlins in metazoans

Expansion of the ferlin gene family

Much can be learnt about the evolution of genes and
gene families from phylogenetic analysis. Given that
mammalian ferlins are highly similar, little information
can be inferred from their sequence comparisons. We
therefore sought ferlin genes from selected phyla separated by larger evolutionary distances. Ferlin protein
sequences from three protist and eight metazoan phyla
(Table 1) were subjected to phylogenetic analysis
(Figure 1). The SMART and Pfam database revealed

To further explore the expansion of the ferlin family
during vertebrate evolution, from two ferlin paralogs in
invertebrates to six ferlin paralogs in vertebrates, we
used draft genome sequences of the basal vertebrates
lamprey (Petromyzon marinus, Pmar) and elephant
shark (Callorhinchus miliI, Cmil)[33]. As the ferlin
genes are quite large in comparison to sequences within
contigs of draft genomes, it becomes impossible to find
whole ferlin genes within a single scaffold. However,

Figure 1 Maximum likelihood tree of ferlin genes from selected phyla. The putative ferlin from Pfal was used as an outgroup (CAX64098).
Bootstrap values from 100 iterations are shown for major branches. Bootstrap values below 55 are indicated by an asterisk. DysF containing
ferlins are partitioned into the bottom half of the tree (shaded blue box), while the non-DysF containing ferlins are partitioned into the top half
of the tree (shaded orange box). FER1 and FERL1 of C. elegans form a separate sub-tree within the DysF subtree, while Misfire of D. melanogaster
form an outgroup in the non-DysF subtree.

shorter stretches of conserved sequences encoding C2
domains (~100 amino acids) provide a plausible
sequence length to detect in their entirety within a
given scaffold. Analysis of sequence conservation
amongst ferlin C2 domains revealed highest homology
of C2E and C2F (discussed below in detail, see Table 2),
and thus these two domains were separately employed
as reference sequences to identify and extract ferlin
genes from the lamprey and elephant shark draft
genome sequences.
Ferlin tree topologies produced using C2E and C2F
sequences, including those of Pmar and Cmil, produced
a branching pattern (Figure 3) similar to those produced
by the full-length ferlins (Figure 2), recapitulating DysF
and non-Dysf subgrouping, and subtrees formed by
paralogs. Our results indicate that there is enough information within C2F (and C2E) sequences to distinguish
between ferlin paralogs, validating our approach in
using this region for the retrieval of partial unannotated
ferlin genes for producing maximum likelihood trees.
Our results show that there are at least five ferlin

paralogs in the shark (Cmil, low coverage of draft
sequence may obscure a sixth ferlin gene) and at least
two ferlin paralogs in the lamprey (Pmar). Therefore,
our results suggest the expansion of the ferlin gene
family from two to six ferlin genes occurred between
the divergence of the jawless vertebrates (Pmar) and the
cartilaginous fish (Cmil) during vertebrate evolution.
Interestingly, the expansion of the ferlin gene family
corresponds to whole genome duplication events
thought to have occurred twice during vertebrate evolution, one near the divergence of jawless vertebrates and
the other near the divergence of cartilaginous fish [34].
Ferlin domain topologies

Figure 2 highlights the different domain topologies
noted amongst the ferlin genes in this study. Genes
which cluster within the DysF subgroup of Figure 1 are
denoted as Type 1, and genes which cluster within the
non-DysF subgroup are denoted as Type 2. Additionally,
within each type there are subtle differences in domain
topology giving rise to subtypes A-F (see Figure 2

containing ferlins (Type 2) are labelled A-F as follows - A: ferlin topology containing all seven C2 domains; B: (-)C2DE; C: (-)C2A; D: (-)C2A, (-)
C2DE; E: (-)C2A, (-)C2DE, (-)FerB; F: (-)C2A, (-)C2 D, (-)C2E, (-)C2DE,(-)C2F. Domain classifications are an amalgamation of SMART (C2, DysF and

C-term. Domains colored in white are below threshold detection of SMART.

legend). The major differences between the subtypes are
the presence or absence of C2A (first N-terminal C2
domain), the FerA domain, or the C2DE domain (the
C2 domain between C2 D and C2E).
All ferlin genes analysed possess multiple tandem C2
domains, with two highly conserved features: 1) An

N-terminal FerI sequence sandwiched between two C2
domains (C2B-FerI-C2C motif); 2) Two C2 domains
adjacent to a transmembrane sequence at the extreme
C-terminus. All metazoan ferlins possessed these two
features, with the exception of the putative truncated
Fer1L of C. elegans, and reported truncated splice

isoforms of Misfire [35]. These two features were also
observed in putative ferlins of single-celled Apicomplexa
such as the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum
(Pfal).
Two outliers in terms of ferlin topology were truncated C. elegans Fer1L, and the Drosophila ferlin gene,
Misfire. The unusual truncated topology of C. elegans
Fer1L (see Figure 2) was also detected for C. brenneri,
but not in three other analysed genomes within the Caenorhabditis genus (see Additional file 1). C. elegans
Fer1L also has only a partial DysF domain, and it
remains unclear whether Fer1L arose as a result of partial gene duplication, or whether a series of deletions
followed a complete gene duplication of Fer-1. Misfire is
distinct from all other arthropod ferlins, lacking the
FerB domain and possessing a divergent C2F (end Cterminal C2 domain) that is below the C2 domain
detection threshold of SMART.
C2 domain conservation

Given that C2 domains represent the most abundant
and distinctive feature of the ferlin gene family, we
sought to establish the conservation of individual C2
domains throughout metazoan evolution (Table 2). A
comparison of invertebrate ferlin C2 domains with
human dysferlin and otoferlin revealed high sequence
conservation in general, but particularly in the C-terminal C2 domains, C2E and C2F. In contrast, the N-terminal C2 domains have either been lost or have lower
similarity. Human otoferlin and sea anemone ortholog

Nvec FER1L2, are the only non-Dysf (Type 2) topology
ferlins to maintain C2A, which is also absent in many
invertebrate Dysf-containing (Type 1) topology ferlins.
Interestingly, arthropod (Phum) and mollusc (Lgig) type
2 ferlins have very high sequence conservation of C2
domains when compared to otoferlin, suggesting ancestral functions/interactions may be preserved throughout
metazoan evolution.
Conservation of C2 domain calcium-binding residues

In classical calcium-sensitive C2 domains, there are five
aspartates involved in the binding of calcium ions which
results in electrostatic changes necessary for phospholipid binding [16]. In this study we have performed a
multiple sequence alignment of dysferlin C2 domains
against C2A of Synaptotagmin I to identify the corresponding calcium-binding residues by alignment (Table
3). Identification of calcium-binding residues in this case
has allowed for the highly conservative D®E substitutions, as observed in some calcium-binding C2 domains
[36]. C2E and C2F are shown to conserve classical calcium-binding residues across all six mammalian ferlin
paralogs, and most invertebrate ferlin orthologs, with
the exception of Fer1 of C. elegans and several apicomplexan parasites. Some ferlins show more C2 domains
with potential calcium-binding, for instance, dysferlin
(Fer1L1) shows sequence conservation of predicted calcium-binding aspartates in four C2 domains; C2C, C2
D, C2E and C2F. For ferlin C2 domains that lack the
classical aspartate (or glutamate) residues, substitutions
in the position of calcium-binding residues are often to
a serine or asparagine, both of which are residue substitutions previously characterised to inactivate calciumdependent phospholipid binding in C2A domain of
synaptotagmins IV and XI [36].
Conservation of non-C2 domains

So far, no function or interaction has been attributed to
the DysF, FerI, FerA or FerB domains in the ferlins. The
highly conserved region preceding C2 D that is present
in dysferlin, myoferlin and Fer1L5 has been termed
DysF according to the SMART database, but is not
annotated as a conserved/identifiable domain by the
Pfam database. In contrast, the FerA, FerB and FerI
regions are classified as domains by Pfam but not by
SMART. Our analysis of metazoan phyla suggests all
should be considered as domain units with potential
function due to high conservation across orthologs and
paralogs.

in DysF containing ferlins (Type 1), suggesting FerA and
DysF may have complementary or additive function.
FerI and DysF

The FerI and DysF domains are of particular interest as
both have been identified in ferlin-like proteins of unicellular eukaryotes. The FerI domain, but not the DysF
domain, was discovered in ferlin-like proteins of protozoan Apicomplexan parasites Plasmodium (malaria),
Theileria [Genbank:XP_765088] (East Coast fever),
Babesia [Genbank:XP_001610088] (tick fever) and Toxoplasma [Genbank:XP_002364209] (toxoplasmosis) (data
not shown), that account for significant worldwide mortality and morbidity amongst humans and livestock.
Similar to the metazoan ferlins, the FerI domains in
these Apicomplexan parasites are sandwiched closely
between two C2 domains. This could suggest that the
C2-FerI-C2 motif functions as a single entity and may
have a fundamental function shared between metazoan
and protozoan putative ferlins.

Figures 6 and 7 shows high sequence conservation of
both inner and outer DysF domains, and confirms that
its existence as a nested repeat has not caused major
sequence divergence in either its inner or outer version,
compared to the unembedded DysF in Pex30p. Interestingly, the DysF domain is also noted in one other human
gene - an uncharacterised gene consisting of beta propeller repeats [Genbank:NP_056210] which contains two
DysF domains, but not present in the embedded form, as
is the case with the ferlins. A family of yeast peroxisomal
proteins Pex30p, Pex31p and Pex32p has also been identified to contain a DysF domain, again as a nonembedded form [20]. Studies have specifically isolated
the DysF domain in these genes as a regulator of normal
peroxisome number and size. Thus the DysF domain is
of ancient origins, and is uniquely present as an
embedded repeat only in the ferlins (with the exception
of unicellular protist Ehux with a single DysF domain
that exists as an unembedded form).

Discussion
Over recent years, advances in sequencing technology
have led to the increasing pursuit of genome-wide

sequencing of many species. The public availability of
data via online databases has in turn enabled individuals
to pursue phylogenetic research of their gene of interest
to complement their laboratory studies. In this study we
present a phylogenetic study, selecting representative
vertebrate and invertebrate eukaryotic genomes to shed
evolutionary insight into the characteristic features that
define the ferlin gene family.
There are six ferlin genes identified in humans to date;
three consisting of a DysF domain (Type 1), and three
without (Type 2). However, our genomic analysis identified only two ferlins in invertebrates (one Type 1 and
one Type 2), suggesting that the six mammalian ferlins
originated from two ancestral ferlins of distinct subtypes. The need for metazoans to maintain ferlins of
two different types suggests that DysF imparts a specific
function, conserved throughout evolution. It is not clear
whether the DysF domain was gained in an ancestral
ferlin then maintained throughout evolution due to a
selective advantage, or, whether the DysF domain was
lost following a gene duplication event, also imparting a
selective advantage. Arthropods and nematodes were
observed as exceptions; a DysF-containing ferlin is not

maintained in arthropods, while a non-DysF ferlin is not
maintained in nematodes. Using highly conserved C2
domain sequences, we were able to identify and extract
two ferlin paralogs in the lamprey (Cmil) and five in the
shark (Pmar), narrowing down the likely expansion of
the ferlin gene family between the divergence of the
jawless vertebrates and the cartilaginous fish. Ferlin-like
genes consisting of at least five C2 domains, a C-terminal transmembrane region, and a C2-FerI-C2 motif

were also identified in five species of Apicomplexa parasites (Plasmodium, Cryptospiridium, Theileria, Babesia
and Toxoplasma), and in unicellular phytoplankton
(Ostreococcus), further supporting an ancient role of
ferlin-like proteins in eukaryotic biology. Plasmodium
and other apicomplexan parasites are characterised by a
specialized apicoplast membrane, possess specialised
secretory organelles (rhoptries) thought to be involved
in events leading to host cell invasion, and form

membrane vesicular structures termed ‘parasitophorous
vacuolar membrane’ (PVM) in which the organism
resides [37]. Given the large nature of the PVM (3033um in surface area), the biological process which
underlies its ability to form de novo in 10-20 seconds
remains a curious area of research for many in the field
[38]. With emerging roles for vertebrate ferlins in
plasma membrane vesicle fusion [3,6,10], and the particular association of ferlins with cells possessing specialised plasma membrane networks such as skeletal and
cardiac muscle [4], placenta [39], and sperm acrosome
[40], a potential role for ferlins in specialist membrane
networks of apicomplexan parasites provides an intriguing avenue for investigation.
Following the identification of the dysferlin gene in
1998, and the shared homology with Fer-1 of C. elegans, Fer-1 has since been thought of as the ancestral
ferlin from which the human ferlins were derived. Our
phylogenetic analysis of multiple invertebrate ferlins
suggests that Fer-1 is not a typical ferlin gene. Despite
some regions of homology, Fer-1 (and Drosophila Misfire) form outgroups in the ferlin phylogenetic tree
(Figure 1). Fer-1 shows loss of conserved residues that

define the DysF domain, while Misfire has lost the
FerB domain present in all other metazoan ferlins.
Maximum likelihood tree and intra-genus sequence
comparison shows sequence divergence of Dmel and
Cele from other species within their genus (Additional
file 1 and 2), which is typical of rapidly evolving reproduction-related genes [41]. Misfire and Fer-1 may
therefore present as exceptions, having lost and/or
gained functions not shared across the ferlin family.
Thus, we recommend caution when translating findings from studies of ferlin function in Drosophila and
C. elegans, to that of ferlin-related diseases in humans,
such as muscular dystrophy and non-syndromic deafness. Our results also highlight that species such as
zebra fish (Drer) may represent a useful model organism, possessing the full complement of both DysF and
non-DysF subgroups, and also technical utility for studies of muscle form and function.
In our sequence analysis of ferlin genes, we identified
several conserved features amongst ferlin proteins; multiple tandem C2 domains (5-7), a single C-terminal
transmembrane domain, a FerB domain, and a highly
conserved N-terminal motif consisting of a FerI tightly

sandwiched between two C2 domains. Slight variations
in topologies include the incorporation of the optional
C2A domain, the C2DE domain, and the FerA domain
that appears to be concurrently present with the DysF
domain.
Our analysis of the DysF domain shows it has maintained high sequence conservation. The presence of two
DysF domains in a nested fashion is a unique and
ancient feature of the ferlin family preserved from early
diverging metazoans (Tadh, Nvec) through to humans.
Despite resolution of the inner DysF domain structure
of myoferlin, its function and purpose remains unknown
[21]. Our analysis shows that nesting of the DysF has
not caused sequence divergence in either the inner or
outer DysF regions. Importantly, NMR structural studies
have shown that the inner DysF inserts between important secondary structures of the outer DysF domain,
thus allowing for both to fold into a similar structure. In

addition, reported pathogenic mutations occurring
within and between the inner and outer DysF domains
of dysferlin suggests that the act of embedding has not
disabled the functional capacity of this domain [21].
Interestingly, the DysF domain, although not in nested
form, has also been reported to exist in yeast peroxisome proteins [20]. The function of the DysF domain in
these proteins is to regulate peroxisome size and number. Therefore, given that dysferlin is localised to vesicles [6], the function of the DysF domain could
analogously be hypothesized to regulate vesicle size and
number.
In the species we have analyzed, the C-terminal C2
domains of the ferlins are shown to be more conserved
than the N-terminal C2 domains. This suggests that the
ferlin C-terminus is perhaps responsible for functions
more fundamental, than specialized. In contrast, we
observed more divergence within the N-terminus,

Lek et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:231
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/231

whereby some species lack C2A, or possess a variation
that is highly divergent. These data suggest the ferlin Nterminus could be responsible for functions that are
more species specific, and/or ortholog specific, rather
than unified across the ferlin family. Despite the lack of
conservation of C2A and its absence in certain species,
there is evidence to suggest that it remains functional in
human ferlins. The solved structure of myoferlin C2A
indicates that it is capable of folding into the characteristic C2 domain beta-sandwich, although consisting of
more than the typical eight strands. In addition, an
alternate splice isoform of C2A of unknown function, in
which an alternate exon 1 is used in C2A, is reported to
be expressed at significant levels in skeletal muscle and
blood cells [42]. Furthermore, several missense mutations (Tryp52Arg, Val67Asp) lying within C2A are listed
as probable muscular dystrophy causing changes. Dysferlin interaction with AHNAK, a protein implicated in
membrane repair and maintenance has also been localised to C2A [43].
As seen in the ferlins, several C2 domains belonging
to the synaptotagmin family also show degeneration of
calcium-binding residues. In synaptotagmins, where
structural data in addition to sequence data is available,
these changes have been shown to confer ablation of
calcium sensitivity [36]. Despite the caveat of lacking
known structural data relating to the ferlins, sequence
alignment with synaptotagmin C2 domains reveals high
sequence and secondary structure conservation, with
identifiable conservation of calcium-binding residues
within many ferlin C2 domains. In our studies, four out
of seven C2 domains in dysferlin show conservation of
calcium-binding residues. A previous sequence analysis
reports a similar result, although this study did not
allow for the highly conservative D®E substitution [22],
and therefore did not identify C2 D and C2E as potential calcium binding domains. Contrary to expectation, a
study into the lipid binding specificities of dysferlin C2
domains reports calcium-independent phospholipid
binding associated with the C2 domains presented here
as most likely to possess calcium sensitivity [44]. It is
however still plausible that these C2 domains possess a
calcium-sensitive role, but one that is coupled to protein-protein interaction(s), as is the case with calciumdependent t-SNARE binding in Synaptotagmin I [45]. In
otoferlin, calcium-dependent binding to two t-SNARE
proteins of the inner hair synaptic complex, syntaxin1A
and SNAP-25 has been mapped to C2F [46], which in
our study is shown to possess the full complement of
calcium-binding residues. Another study also reports
otoferlin C2A as capable of binding syntaxin1A,
although in a manner that is calcium-independent, presumably due to the lack of calcium coordinating residues in the C2A domain [46].

Page 13 of 15

The function and need for so many C2 domains in the
ferlins remains a mystery. To draw further lessons from
the synaptotagmin family, possible reasons could be
attributed to preferential lipid recognition, differential
calcium sensitivities, or an expanded repertoire of protein-protein interactions. When the crystal structure of
the cytosolic portion of Synaptotagmin I was solved, it
was discovered that C2A and C2B were facing in opposite directions [47]. This peculiar orientation was later
attributed to the fact that both interact with two opposing membranes of different lipid composition, where
C2A was shown to bind synaptic vesicle membranes,
while C2B showed preference towards the PI(4,5)P2 rich
plasma membrane. This idea of lipid selectivity and preferential binding has been corroborated to an extent, in
studies which showed that dysferlin C2A could be distinguished from other C2 domains with its unique phosphoinositide binding ability not commonly seen in
others [44].
The idea of synergy and co-operativity between tandem C2 domains is also another novel concept explored
in synaptotagmins. Interestingly, studies of C2A and
C2B in isolation show they display different properties
than when the two are studied together in tandem. In
isolation, C2A of Synaptotagmin I does not bind
SNAREs, whereas C2B does not penetrate lipid membranes. However, when tethered to an adjacent C2
domain, C2A is able to bind SNAREs [48], whereas
tethering C2B to C2A, even a non-functional version
which fails to bind lipid or calcium, enables C2B binding
and penetration of membranes. Experimental evidence
reports the requirement for simultaneous neutralisation
of calcium binding residues in both C2 domains of
synaptotagmin to completely disrupt calcium triggered
membrane and SNARE interaction, thus indicative of
functional redundancy between adjacent C2 domains
[48]. It remains to be established whether there is interdomain co-operativity and/or functional redundancy
shared between ferlin C2 domains.
In this study we have surveyed a range of domain
topologies present amongst ferlin genes, highlighting
highly preserved domain regions, as well as species-specific domain combinations. Together, this information
provides valuable insight into the minimal components
required to construct a basic ferlin-like gene. Research
into mini-gene (truncated) therapeutic constructs for
gene restoration is currently underway for other genes
associated with muscular dystrophy such as dystrophin,
whose size exceeds the 5kb AAV vector packaging limit
[49]. We hypothesise that functional ‘mini-ferlins’ will
require evolutionarily preserved C2-FerI-C2 (~274aa)
and C2E-C2F-TM (~489aa) motifs, with (dysferlin) or
without (otoferlin) the nested DysF repeat (~228aa
embedded form).

In summary, we define ferlins as an ancient family of
C2 domain-containing proteins that are likely to possess
primordial functions in eukaryotic biology. Our studies
demonstrate expansion of the ferlin family during vertebrate evolution; often a basis for functional specialization and tissue-specific expression. We provide useful
contextual insight into evolutionary preservation of not
only the C2 domains, but also the less studied DysF,
FerI, FerA and FerB protein domains. Defining the roles
of each of these domains is essential to delineate the
biology of ferlins, with clinical relevance to inherited
human disease (dysferlin and otoferlin), and perhaps
more widely significant in future studies of apicomplexan parasitology.

Conclusion
In this study we show that ferlins are an ancient family
of genes common across protists and metazoans, but
not in plants or fungi. Metazoans were shown to maintain distinct Type I (with a Dysf domain) and Type II
(without a Dysf domain) ferlin lineages; with invertebrates generally possessing two ferlins, and vertebrates
possessing six ferlins. Unexpectedly, ferlins from model
organisms C.elegans (Fer-1) and Drosophila (misfire)
presented as phylogenetic outgroups, suggesting reproduction-related divergence. All ferlins possess an Nterminal C2-FerI-C2 sandwich, a FerB motif, and two
C-terminal C2 domains adjacent to an extreme C-terminal transmembrane domain. Preservation of these structural elements throughout eukaryotic evolution suggests
a fundamental role of these motifs for ferlin function.
