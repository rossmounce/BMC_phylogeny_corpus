Abstract
Background: The vasopressin receptor type 1b (AVPR1B) is mainly expressed by pituitary
corticotropes and it mediates the stimulatory effects of AVP on ACTH release; common AVPR1B
haplotypes have been involved in mood and anxiety disorders in humans, while rodents lacking a
functional receptor gene display behavioral defects and altered stress responses.
Results: Here we have analyzed the two exons of the gene and the data we present suggest that
AVPR1B has been subjected to natural selection in humans. In particular, analysis of exon 2 strongly
suggests the action of balancing selection in African populations and Europeans: the region displays
high nucleotide diversity, an excess of intermediate-frequency alleles, a higher level of withinspecies diversity compared to interspecific divergence and a genealogy with common haplotypes
separated by deep branches. This relatively unambiguous situation coexists with unusual features
across exon 1, raising the possibility that a nonsynonymous variant (Gly191Arg) in this region has
been subjected to directional selection.
Conclusion: Although the underlying selective pressure(s) remains to be identified, we consider
this to be among the first documented examples of a gene involved in mood disorders and
subjected to natural selection in humans; this observation might add support to the long-debated
idea that depression/low mood might have played an adaptive role during human evolution.

Background
The neurohypophyseal peptide vasopressin (AVP) is
involved in different physiological functions, including
stimulation of liver glycogenolysis, contraction of vascular smooth muscle cells, antidiuresis and platelet aggregation (reviewed in [1]). In addition, AVP plays an
important role as a regulator of the hypothalamic-pitui-

tary-adrenal (HPA) axis [2,3]. AVP receptors are G protein-coupled and can be divided in three subtypes: V1a,
V1b, and V2, encoded in humans by AVPR1A, AVPR1B
and AVPR2, respectively (reviewed in [1]). The V2 receptor is primarily expressed in the kidney and it controls
renal collecting duct water permeability. AVPR1A has
wider expression and it regulates physiological effects

such as vascular cell contraction, glycogenolysis and platelet aggregation. The type 1b receptor is mainly expressed
by pituitary corticotropes and it mediates the stimulatory
effects of AVP on ACTH release. Nonetheless, AVPR1B
expression has also been described in many brain areas
[4,5] and in different peripheral tissues [4], while recent
evidences have indicated that AVP can induce glucagone
and insulin secretion from isolated rodent pancreatic
islets through the V1b receptor [6,7].
Recently, considerable attention has been placed on the
role of AVP and its receptors in complex behavioral tracts.
Indeed, variations the AVPR1A promoter region have
been shown to influence reproductive and social behavior
in voles [8], as well as complex behavioral traits in
humans such as altruism [9], reproductive attitudes
[10,11] and creative dance performance [12]. Therefore,
different studies [8,13] have analyzed the evolutionary
history of the type 1a receptor in different mammalian
species. In comparison, AVPR1B has attracted less attention, although data from knock-out mice (V1bR-/-) indicate that it plays central roles in both behavioral and
metabolic systems. Its regulatory function on the HPA axis
is demonstrated by the reduced levels of circulating ACTH
and corticosterone under both stress and resting conditions in V1bR-/- animals [2]. These mice also exhibit limited aggressive behavior [14] and reduced ultrasonic
vocalizations in different social contexts [15]. Interestingly, a selective V1b antagonist produces anxiolytic- and
antidepressant-like effects in rodents [16] and in humans
AVPR1B variants have been associated with recurrent
major depression [17], early-onset mood disorders [18]
and panic disorder [19]. In line with these findings, the
receptor has been proposed as a possible therapeutic target in stress-related disorders [20].

data for 238 resequenced human genes were derived from
the NIEHS SNPs Program web site [22]. We selected genes
that had been resequenced in populations of defined ethnicity including African American (AA), EU, YRI and East
Asians (AS) (NIEHS panel 2). In particular, for each
NIEHS gene a 2 kb region was randomly selected; the only
requirement was that it did not contain any resequencing
gap. Haplotypes were inferred using PHASE version 2.1
[23,24], a program for reconstructing haplotypes from
unrelated genotype data through a Bayesian statistical
method. Haplotypes for individuals resequenced in this
study are available as supplemental material (Additional
File 1).
Statistical analysis
Phylogenetic relationships among primate AVPR1B genes
were reconstructed by obtaining a tree with use of
MrBayes [25]. In particular, we run a Markov chain for 1
million cycles under the HKY85 model of DNA substitution with no rate variation across sites.

The ratio of dN over dS was calculated using CODEML in
the PAML Package (v.3.15) [26]. We used the so-called
"free-ratio" model in which dn/ds is free to vary among
branches with no variation among sites.
Linkage disequilibrium analyzes were performed using
the Haploview software (v. 4.1) [27] and blocks were
identified through the implemented confidence interval
algorithm [28]. In particular, marker pairs are defined to
be in "strong LD" if the one-sided upper 95% confidence
bound on D' is >0.98 and the lower bound is above 0.7; a
block is created when if 95% of informative comparisons
are in "strong LD".

DNA samples and sequencing
Human genomic DNA was obtained from the Coriell
Institute for Medical Research. The genomic DNA of one
gorilla and one gibbon was derived from the European
Collection of Cell Cultures (ECACC). All analyzed regions
were PCR amplified and directly sequenced; primer
sequences are available upon request. PCR products were
treated with ExoSAP-IT (USB Corporation Cleveland
Ohio, USA), directly sequenced on both strands with a Big
Dye Terminator sequencing Kit (v3.1 Applied Biosystem)
and run on an Applied Biosystems ABI 3130 XL Genetic
Analyzer (Applied Biosystem). Sequences were assembled
using AutoAssembler version 1.4.0 (Applied Biosystems),
and inspected manually by two distinct operators.

Tajima's D [29], Fu and Li's D* and F* [30] statistics, as
well as diversity parameters θW [31] and π [32] were calculated using libsequence [33], a C++ class library providing
an object-oriented framework for the analysis of molecular population genetic data. Coalescent simulations were
performed using the cosi package [34] and its best-fit
parameters for YRI, AA, EU and AS populations with
10000 iterations. Additional coalescent simulations were
computed with the ms software [35] specifying the
number of chromosomes, the mutation parameter estimated from the data, and the recombination rate with
10000 iterations for each demographic model. The other
parameters for each model were set as previously proposed [36,37]. Estimates of the population recombination rate parameter ρ were obtained with the use of the
Web application MAXDIP [38].

Data retrieval and haplotype construction
Genotype data for Yoruba (YRI) and Europeans (EU) were
retrieved from the SeattleSNPs website [21]. Genotype

The Maximum-likelihood-ratio HKA test was performed
using the MLHKA software [39] using multi-locus data of
15 NIEHS genes (reference genes) and Pan troglodytes

(NCBI panTro2) as an outgroup. The 15 reference genes
were randomly selected among NIEHS loci shorter than
20 kb that have been resequenced in the 4 populations
(panel 2). The reference set was accounted for by the following genes: ENO1, VNN2, MMP12, GLRX, CHRNA4,
SULT1C2, PRDX6, H2AFX, ODC1, MT2A, RETN, CYP4B1,
RECQL4, MCL1 and MB. In particular, we evaluated the
likelihood of the model under two different assumptions:
that all loci evolved neutrally and that only the region
under analysis was subjected to natural selection; statistical significance was assessed by a likelihood ratio test. We
used a chain length (the number of cycles of the Markov
chain) of 2 × 105 and, as suggested by the authors [39], we
ran the program several times with different seeds to
ensure stability of results. A second multi-locus HKA test
was performed using the "HKA" software distributed by
Jody Hey [40] and the same reference loci reported above;
1000 coalescent simulations were performed with the cosi
package [34]. In both cases only neutrally evolving sites
were considered.
Median-joining networks to infer haplotype genealogy
was constructed using NETWORK 4.5 [41]. Estimate of
the time to the most common ancestor (TMRCA) was
obtained using a phylogeny based approach implemented
in NETWORK 4.5 using a mutation rate based on the
number of fixed differences between chimpanzee and
humans. A second TMRCA estimate derived from application of a maximum-likelihood coalescent method implemented in GENETREE [42,43]. Again, the mutation rate μ
was obtained on the basis of the divergence between
human and chimpanzee and under the assumption both
that the species separation occurred 6 MYA and of a generation time of 25 years. Using this μ and θ maximum
likelihood (θML), we estimated the effective population
size parameter (Ne). With these assumptions, the coalescence time, scaled in 2Ne units, was converted into years.
For the coalescence process, 106 simulations were performed. A third TMRCA was calculated as previously proposed [44] that calculates the average nucleotide diversity
between the MRCA and each of the chromosomes.
All calculations were performed in the R environment
[45].
Molecular modeling
The three-dimensional model of the human V1b receptor
(Swiss-Prot entry: P47901) was obtained by comparative
modelling using the known crystal structure of the closely
related bovine rhodopsin (Protein Data Bank ID 1u19) as
a template, as provided by MODBASE [46]. The significance of the alignment between target and template
sequences is E = 4e-87. The retrieved structure was rendered
with FirstGlance in Jmol [47].

Results
AVPR1B evolution in primates
As a first step, we wished to gain insight into the evolutionary history of AVPR1B in primates; to this aim the two
exons (including the 5' and 3'UTRs) were sequenced from
gorilla and gibbon genomic DNA, while the gene
sequences for additional primate species (namely, chimpanzee, orangutan and macaque) were retrieved from
public databases. A phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1) was produced for the 6 primates with the use of MrBayes [25]. It
is worth noting that the failure to resolve the humanchimpanzee-gorilla trichotomy is likely due to the short
span of the analyzed region (a total of ~1.7 kb). Using the
free ratio model we calculated the dN/dS ratio (ω) along all
lineages; in all cases low ratios are observed indicating
that AVPR1B has evolved under purifying selection in primates. Calculation of ω for the human-chimpanzee pairwise alignment resulted in a value of 0.28, comparable to
the average value for all human genes (ω = 0.23) [48].
Nucleotide diversity and neutrality tests
We next aimed at analyzing the evolution of AVPR1B in
human populations. We therefore resequenced the two
exons of AVPR1B and their flanking sequences (including
the putative promoter, part of the intron and the 3'UTR)
in two populations of Asian and African American ancestry. Additional data referring to YRI and EU subjects were
derived from the SeattleSNPs website. The final data set
was accounted for by 96 individuals belonging to 4 ethnically distinct populations. A total of 37 SNPs were identified; among these 3 and 1 nonsynonymous substitutions
were located in exon 1 (Lys65Asn, Gly191Arg and
Ser267Gly) and exon 2 (Arg364His), respectively. Three
synonymous coding variants were also identified
(Leu130Leu and His224His in exon 1 and Ser373Ser in
exon 2).

Analysis of linkage disequilibrium indicated that AVPR1B
lies on a single haplotype block in EU and AS, but not in
African populations (see Additional File 2). Nucleotide
diversity was assessed using two indexes: θW [31], an estimate of the expected per site heterozygosity, and π [32]
the average number of pairwise sequence nucleotide differences. In order to compare the values we obtained for
the two AVPR1B exons, we calculated θW and π for a set of
randomly selected 2 kb windows deriving from 238 genes
resequenced by the NIEHS program in the same population samples; the percentile rank corresponding to exon 1
(Ex1) and 2 (Ex2) in the distribution of values for reference 2 kb windows is reported in table 1 and indicates that
Ex2 displays high nucleotide diversity in all populations,
despite showing a level of human-chimpanzee divergence
(0.011) comparable to the genome average [49]; the same
holds true for Ex1 when African subjects are considered,

while AS and EU show no unusual nucleotide variation
pattern in this gene region. Under neutral evolution, values of θW and π are expected to be roughly equal; for both
Ex1 and Ex2 this is not verified in most cases (Tab. 1) and
we therefore wished to investigate whether AVPR1B might
be subjected to natural selection in humans. Widely used
neutrality tests include Tajima's D (DT [29]) and Fu and
Li's D* and F* [30]. DT evaluates the departure from neutrality by comparing θW and π. Positive values of DT indicate an excess of intermediate frequency variants and are

an hallmark of balancing selection; negative DT values
indicate either purifying selection or a high representation
of rare variants as a result of a selective sweep. Fu and Li's
F* and D* are also based on SNP frequency spectra and
differ from DT in that they also take into account whether
mutations occur in external or internal branches of a genealogy. Since, population history, in addition to selective
processes, is known to affect frequency spectra and all
related statistics, we performed coalescent simulations for
all populations using a model that incorporates demo-

graphic scenarios [34]. Additional demographic models
[36,37] were used for coalescent simulations and the
results, which confirm those reported below, are available
as additional file 3. Also, in order to disentangle the effects
of selection and population history, we exploited the fact
that selection acts on a single locus while demography
affects the whole genome: as a control data set we therefore calculated test statistics for the 2 kb reference windows deriving from NIEHS genes. Neutrality tests for Ex1
were consistent with neutrality for African populations,
while marginally significant negative values of Fu and Li's
F* and D* where obtained for EU. In the case of AS only
3 segregating SNPs are observed in the region.

generating gene genealogies for a 8.5 kb region (corresponding to the AVPR1B gene); simulations were performed with the estimated recombination rate for
AVPR1B and using the cosi package with its best-fit parameters for EU [34]. The simulated samples were then treated
as the gene and DT was calculated for the first 2268 bp and
the last 2112 bp (corresponding to Ex1 and Ex2). The
results indicated the probability of observing a difference
in DT values as large as or larger than that we observe for
the two AVPR1B exons amounts to 0.035, therefore rejecting a neutral scenario.
Under neutral evolution, the amount of within-species
diversity is predicted to correlate with levels of betweenspecies divergence, since both depend on the neutral
mutation rate [51]. The HKA test [52] is commonly used
to verify whether this expectation is verified. Here we
applied a Maximum-Likelihood-ratio HKA (MLHKA) test
[39] by comparing polymorphisms and divergence levels
at AVPR1B Ex1 and Ex2 with 15 NIEHS genes resequenced
in the four populations we analyzed (see methods). The
results are shown in table 2 and indicate that for Ex1 a
reduction in nucleotide diversity versus divergence is
detectable in the AS sample although the result is not statistically significant. The opposite situation is verified at
Ex2, a significant excess of polymorphisms being
observed in all populations. The MLHKA test is relatively
robust to demography given its multi-locus comparison
framework [39]; still, while this method is conservative in
cases of population expansion (i.e. for populations of
African origin), population size bottlenecks might artificially result in significant p values [39]. In order to evaluate whether this is the case, a second multi-locus HKA test
was performed using the "HKA" software [40] which
allows estimation of statistical significance through coalescent simulations. These latter were performed using a
previously describe demographic model [34] as above
and significant results were obtained for both EU and AS
(Tab. 2); in both cases the test of maximum cell value [53]
indicated AVPR1B Ex2 as an outlier (p = 0.018 and 0.001
for EU and AS, respectively).

In contrast, data for Ex2 indicate departure from neutrality
in most populations (excluding AS) with significantly
positive values for most statistics. In line with these findings, DT, as well as Fu and Li's F* and D* calculated for
AVPR1B Ex2 rank above the 95th percentile of the distribution of reference 2 kb windows in non-Asian populations. These latter results suggest that nucleotide diversity
in Ex2 has been shaped by balancing selection; conversely, the negative statistics observed for EU at Ex1 can
in principle be explained by either purifying selection or
directional selection since both processes result in an
excess of low frequency variants. Fay and Wu's H [50] is
usually applied to distinguish between the two possibilities. Negative H values indicate an excess of high frequency derived alleles, a finding consistent with the
action of directional but not purifying selection. Calculation of Fay and Wu's H for EU resulted in a significantly
negative value (H = -9.27, p = 0.0006).
A striking feature of these results is the large difference in
DT between Ex1 and Ex2 we observe in the EU sample.
Such a marked variation in the allele frequency spectrum
is even more impressive in light of the strong linkage disequilibrium between the two exons in Europeans (see
Additional File 2). In order to evaluate whether such
change in the frequency spectrum might be due to chance
alone, we performed 10,000 coalescent simulations by
Table 2: Multi-locus HKA test results for AVPR1B exons.

The signatures of balancing selection are predicted to
extend over short genomic distances [54,55]; nonetheless
we wished to verify that the evolution of Ex2 is not influenced by the presence of a linked balanced polymorphism
located elsewhere. To this aim, we exploited the availability in SeattleSNPs of resequencing data covering the whole
gene and extending 2 kb downstream in the intergenic
region. We calculated the ratio of both θW and π to
human-chimpanzee divergence in sliding windows for
YRI and EU. As shown in figure 2, a peak in both ratios is
observed at Ex2 in both populations. This peak decays in
the flanking intergenic region.
As far as coding variants are concerned, analysis of SNPs
in Ex1 indicated that the derived Gly191 allele has risen to
high frequency in most populations and is fixed among
AS. With respect to exon 2, a replacement variant (His364

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/123

allele) displays higher frequency in EU and AS compared
to African populations. Similarity to the other AVP receptors, AVPR1B belongs to the 7-transmembrane receptor
family; residue 191 is located in the second extracellular
loop of the receptor, a region which is believed to be
important for the binding properties of these molecules
[56], including AVPR1A [57]. Indeed, modeling of the
protein (Fig. 3) indicated that the 191 residue is located in
close proximity to Asp185 and Cys186, two residues in
close contact with AVP [58]. With respect to residue 364,
it is located in the intracellular C-terminal tail, a protein
region involved in molecular interactions with adaptors
and scaffolding proteins [59].
Haplotype analysis
In order to study the genealogy of Ex1 and Ex2 haplotypes
we constructed median-joining networks [41]. The topol-

ogy of Ex1 genealogy indicates that, while African chromosomes are relatively diverged from one another, most
Asian and European haplotypes are clustered and all carry
the Gly191 allele (Fig. 4A).
With respect to Ex2 genealogy, two major clades separated
by long branch lengths are evident (Fig. 4B), each containing common haplotypes. Some population differentiation is also present along clade 2 since most non-African
chromosomes are identical and carry the His364 allele,
while YRI and AA also display common haplotypes carrying the Arg364 allele.
In order to estimate the TMRCA (Time to the Most Recent
Common Ancestor) of the two Ex2 haplotype clades, we
applied a phylogeny-based method [41] based on the
measure ρ, the average pairwise difference between the
two haplotype clusters. ρ resulted equal to 6.05, so that
using a mutation rate based on 35 fixed differences
between chimpanzee and humans and a separation time
of 6 million years (MY) [60], we estimated a TMRCA of
3.19 MY years (SD: 673 KY). Given the low recombination rate in the region, we wished to verify this result using
GENETREE, which is based on a maximum-likelihood
coalescent analysis [42,43]. The method assumes an infinite-site model without recombination and, therefore,
haplotypes and sites that violate these assumptions need

to be removed: in this case, only 2 single segregating sites
had to be removed. The resulting gene tree, rooted using
the chimpanzee sequence, is partitioned into two deep
branches (Fig. 5). A maximum-likelihood estimate of θ
(θML) of 2.5 was obtained, resulting in an estimated effective population size (Ne) of 13043, a value comparable to
most figures reported in the literature [61]. Using this
method, the TMRCA of the Ex2 haplotype lineages
amounted to 1.94 MY (SD: 497 KY). A third TMRCA of
3.67 MY was estimated by applying a previously described
method [44] that calculates the average sequence divergence separating the MRCA and each of the chromosomes; coalescence time is then obtained by scaling this
average divergence to the mutation rate obtained from
human-chimpanzee divergence in the region.
All TMRCA estimates indicate an unusually deep coalescent time, as estimates for neutrally evolving autosomal
loci range between 0.8 and 1.5 MY [61]. Deep haplotype
genealogies might result from both balancing selection
and ancient population structure (reviewed in [62]). Yet,
balancing selection is expected to elongate the entire neutral genealogy, while the effects of ancient population
structure are reflected in an increase in the genealogical
time occupied by single lineages [63,64]. A possibility to
discriminate between these two scenarios is to calculate
the percentage of congruent mutations, meaning those

that occur on the basal branches of a genealogy [64].
When we applied this approach to the Ex2 genealogy, a
percentage of congruent mutations equal to 25% was
obtained; this is much lower than previous estimates
under a model of ancient population structure, which
ranged from 42 to 45% [65,66], indicating that balancing
selection rather than population subdivision is responsible for the maintenance of the two clades.

Discussion
The interest in the identification and analysis of genomic
regions subjected to non-neutral evolution is at least twofold. First, such studies provide insight into the evolutionary history of our species, with special reference to the
adaptive events underlying phenotypic changes between
humans and primates/hominids. Second, these analysis
are expected to result in the identification of functional
variants, which in turn, might influence disease susceptibility or drug response. Analysis of AVPR1B evolutionary
history in humans might fit both these aims since the gene
has been involved in complex behavioral traits in other
mammals [14-16] and it has been associated with psychiatric diseases [17-19]. Also, the recently proposed idea
[20] of the receptor as a potential therapeutic target in
stress-related disorders suggests that the identification of
functional variants will be valuable in the field of pharmacogenetics.
Here we have analyzed the two exons of the gene and,
overall, the data we present suggest that AVPR1B has been
subjected to natural selection. Analysis of Ex2 strongly
suggests the action of balancing selection in African populations and Europeans: the region displays high nucleotide diversity, an excess of intermediate-frequency
alleles, a higher level of within-species diversity compared
to interspecific divergence and a genealogy with common
haplotypes separated by deep branches. Yet, this relatively
unambiguous situation is complicated by the presence of
unusual features across Ex1. The possibility that a variant
in this region has been subjected to directional selection
in EU and has reached fixation in AS is supported by few
observations: the large variance of DT in EU and the significantly negative H value in this same population. Yet,
population structure and different demographic scenarios
can yield statistically significant H values, as well [67].
Also, few theoretical models are available to evaluate the
difference in DT at different loci; by performing coalescent
simulations we verified that such a shift in the allele frequency spectrum is unlikely to be due to chance; consistently, previous descriptions [68,69] of marked DT
differences at linked regions were ascribed to natural
selection. Yet, although the closest upstream gene is
located more than 72 kb apart, we cannot exclude that
variants in Ex1 are hitchhiking with a distant selected
allele. Also, the possibility that non-selective forces are

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/123

responsible for this finding cannot be ruled out and the
features we observe might be due to balancing selection
acting on exon 2, with Ex1 being neutrally evolving.
Although we cannot provide definitive evidence for directional selection at Ex1, it is worth mentioning that the
Gly191Arg variant might be a good candidate to represent
a functional SNP: as mentioned above, it is located in the
second extracellular loop, in close proximity to residues
involved in AVP binding (Fig. 3); support to the possible
functional significance of this aminoacid replacement,
comes from the observation that mutagenesis of most residues in the second extracellular loop of AVPR1A results
in altered AVP binding properties [57]; also different missense substitutions in the same region of AVPR2 have
been described to be pathogenetic and cause nephrogenic
diabetes insipidus [70-72]. With respect to the possible
selection targets in Ex2, SNPs located in the 3'UTR (figure
4B) represent possible candidates, although the splitting
of clade 2 into two haplotype clusters with geographically
differentiated distribution suggests that additional variants (either the Arg364His SNP or other UTR polymorphisms) might have been subjected to some selective
pressure, as well. Of course, specific experiments will be
needed to verify whether this prediction is verified. Similarly, a source of selective pressure must be envisaged to
explain our findings. Unfortunately not much is known
on the function and regulation of AVPR1B in humans;
moreover, the gene is not covered by any HapMap SNP at
the moment, so that it is likely to be excluded by most
genome-wide association studies. Instead, some information about the gene derives from experiments in rodents
where AVPR1B function is abolished by either genetic
manipulation or antagonist administration; these experiments imply the inherent difficulty in translating mouse
phenotypes to humans, which is even more complicated
in the case of genes involved in complex behavioral traits,
as AVPR1B is suggested to be. Given this premise, different
possibilities can be envisaged for selection to act on
AVPR1B, including its role in response to stress, psychological/behavioral manifestations and metabolic control.
This latter aspect mainly refers to the expression of
AVPR1B in human pancreas; experiments on isolated
human islets cells, as well as in rodents, indicate that AVP
can induce both glucagon and insulin secretion via binding to AVPR1B [6,73,74]. Also, V1bR-/-mice display insulin
hypersensitivity [73] possibly due to altered signaling in
adipocytes. The possibility therefore exists that one or
more variants in AVPR1B have played an adaptive role as
thrifty alleles [75] by favoring energy storage in times of
low food availability. Indeed, long-standing balancing
selection at the CAPN10 locus, also involved in insulin
secretion and action [76], has previously been demonstrated [77]. In both cases long-term fluctuations in environmental conditions and food availability might be
regarded as an explanation for the maintenance of bal-

anced polymorphisms. Nonetheless, our knowledge on
the regulation of AVPR1B signaling in peripheral tissues is
too limited to allow extensive speculation on this issue.
Conversely, the role of AVP in the stress response is better
characterized; in response to stressful stimuli, AVP acts
synergistically with corticotrophin-releasing hormone
(CRH) to facilitate ACTH release, resulting in a consequent increase in plasma corticosterone/cortisol concentration (reviewed in [78]). Such AVP effect is mediated by
AVPR1B [1] and ACTH measurements in mice have indicated that AVP plays important roles in response to some
acute stressors (e.g. hypoglycemia, forced swim stress,
lipopolysaccharyde challenge and ethanol intoxication,
change in environment), as well as in times of chronic
stress [2,79-83]. Stress responses have an evident adaptive
significance and involve both physical and behavioral
strategies, with the signaling pathway of AVPR1B being
possibly involved in both. Besides the reported associations between AVPR1B and mood or anxiety disorders
[17-19], evidences that the receptor has a role in behavioral traits come from the observation that blocking its activity in mice (either by gene knock-out or
pharmacologically) results in decreased aggressive behaviors [14], reduced social interactions [15] and anxiolyticand antidepressant-like effects [16]. In both humans and
animals (reviewed in [84]), behavioral responses can be
extremely different among individuals of the same species
(reviewed in [84,85]) and recent observations (reviewed
in [84,85]) indicate the maintenance of different behavioral strategies within populations to be adaptive. Frequency-dependent selection is deemed responsible for the
coexistence of behavioral types in populations [86] and,
in general, social interaction behaviors are thought to
have frequency-dependent payoffs [86-88]. Frequencydependent selection is among the possible causes for the
maintenance of balanced alleles; it is therefore conceivable that a portion of genes involved in behavioral traits
have evolved under a balancing selection regime, AVPR1B
possibly representing one such example. An alternative
and non mutually-exclusive explanation for the maintenance of variability in behavior-related traits is response
to changing environmental conditions (reviewed [85]),
which is also expected to result in balancing selection
regimes. Clearly, different behavioral strategies can be
advantageous or disadvantageous depending on the environment; for example, in unpropitious situations organisms might benefit from down-regulating effort and risk
taking, the opposite being true when the environment is
more favorable. These explanations have been regarded as
possibly supporting an adaptive origin for depression/low
mood in humans [89], a condition which has been associated to polymorphisms in AVPR1B [17,18]. The evolutionary hypothesis for depression has been highly
debated in recent scientific literature (see [89] for a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/123

review) and is based both on the high incidence of this
condition in modern populations [89] and on different
observations. For example, anxiety can be advantageous
in perceiving danger [90], a depressive state correlates positively with harm avoidance [91] and favors disengagement from unproductive efforts [89]. Obviously, these
attitudes are selectively advantageous in some environmental conditions (i.e. when action is futile or dangerous)
but not in others. Following this line, balancing selection
rather than directional or positive selection might be
expected at loci which regulate such behavioral traits.

Conclusion
Up to now the evolutionary theory of depression has
received few demonstrations. To our knowledge, the one
we report here might be the first documented example of
a gene involved in mood disorders and subjected to natural selection during human evolutionary history. Nonetheless, it is worth mentioning that the two reports
associating AVPR1B variants to depression/mood disorders identified the same major haplotype as being either
protective or predisposing in different population of
European descent. Dempster et al. [18] suggested that the
discrepancy might result from the use of slightly different
sets of markers; we analyzed the haplotype structure of the
entire gene in EU (not shown) and found little support for
this possibility. Therefore, further studies will be required
before a full knowledge can be obtained of AVPR1B evolutionary role as well as of its association with mental diseases.
