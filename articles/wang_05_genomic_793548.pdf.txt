Abstract
Background: Chemokines and their receptors play important roles in host defense,
organogenesis, hematopoiesis, and neuronal communication. Forty-two chemokines and 19
cognate receptors have been found in the human genome. Prior to this report, only 11 chicken
chemokines and 7 receptors had been reported. The objectives of this study were to systematically
identify chicken chemokines and their cognate receptor genes in the chicken genome and to
annotate these genes and ligand-receptor binding by a comparative genomics approach.
Results: Twenty-three chemokine and 14 chemokine receptor genes were identified in the
chicken genome. All of the chicken chemokines contained a conserved CC, CXC, CX3C, or XC
motif, whereas all the chemokine receptors had seven conserved transmembrane helices, four
extracellular domains with a conserved cysteine, and a conserved DRYLAIV sequence in the
second intracellular domain. The number of coding exons in these genes and the syntenies are
highly conserved between human, mouse, and chicken although the amino acid sequence
homologies are generally low between mammalian and chicken chemokines. Chicken genes were
named with the systematic nomenclature used in humans and mice based on phylogeny, synteny,
and sequence homology.
Conclusion: The independent nomenclature of chicken chemokines and chemokine receptors
suggests that the chicken may have ligand-receptor pairings similar to mammals. All identified
chicken chemokines and their cognate receptors were identified in the chicken genome except
CCR9, whose ligand was not identified in this study. The organization of these genes suggests that
there were a substantial number of these genes present before divergence between aves and
mammals and more gene duplications of CC, CXC, CCR, and CXCR subfamilies in mammals than
in aves after the divergence.

Background
Chemokines are a family of small chemoattrative peptides
that were originally recognized to be involved in host
defense as regulators of leukocyte trafficking, but more
recently have also been shown to have roles in organogenesis, hematopoiesis, and neuronal communication [1].
Their cognate receptors belong to the Class A subfamily of
G-protein coupled receptor superfamily [2]. Chemokines
are believed to have originated from gene duplications
and these genes underwent selection during recent evolutionary time [3]. All chemokines have a characteristic
cysteine motif. Similarly, chemokine receptors may also
be derived from a common ancestor through gene duplications. All chemokine receptors share high homology
with the prototypical family member, rhodopsin [2].
Chemokines are highly basic proteins, 70 to 125 amino
acids long. Sequence identity among chemokines is usually low; however, all share a typical overall tertiary structure, which consists of at least four cysteines that form two
disulfide bonds. Chemokines are divided into two major
(CC and CXC) and two minor (XC and CX3C) subfamilies
based on their four conserved cysteines. The first two
cysteines in the two major subfamilies are either adjacent
(CC) or separated by one amino acid (CXC). The first two
cysteines in the CX3C chemokines are separated by three
amino acids, whereas the XC chemokines contain only
two of the cysteines [4]. The CC chemokines can be further divided into two subcategories, MCPs (monocyte
chemoattractant proteins) and MIPs (macrophage inflammatory proteins) based on their structural similarities [5].
The members of these two CC subcategories specifically
attract mononuclear cells but not neutrophils. The CXC
chemokines can also be divided into two subfamilies, one
with an ELR (a conserved Glu-Leu-Arg preceding the first
cysteine) motif, which is angiogenic and attracts neutrophils, and the other without the ELR motif, whose
members do not attract neutrophils [6].
Chemokine genes are characterized by their chromosomal
locations and similar gene structure. Most human CC and
CXC genes are organized in gene clusters in mammalian
genomes, such as human Chromosomes 4 and 17, and
mouse Chromosomes 5 and 11 [7]. The genes encoding
the CC subfamily contain three exons, whereas the CXC
chemokine genes contain four exons [8,9]. The XC subfamily of chemokines contains two members in human
but only one in mouse. CX3CL1 is the only known member of the CX3C subfamily in human, mouse, rat, and
monkey. There are extensive conserved syntenies in the
chromosomal regions containing chemokine genes
between human and mouse.
Unlike chemokines, chemokine receptors share a higher
degree of sequence identity within a species and between

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/45

species. These receptors have characteristic seven alphahelix transmembrane domains with a length between
340–370 amino acids and have up to 80% amino acid
identity [1]. They also share an acidic amino terminus, a
conserved sequence in the second intracellular loop, and
one cysteine in each extracellular domain [10]. Most
receptors can bind several chemokines of a single class
with high affinity [11]. Like chemokines, most chemokine
receptors are also clustered in a few chromosomal regions,
such as human Chromosomes 2 and 3 [2]. Most amino
acid sequences of chemokine receptors are encoded in
one exon.
At present, 42 chemokine genes have been identified in
human (24 CC, 15 CXC, 1 CX3C, and 2 XC) and 36 (21
CC, 13 CXC, 1 CX3C, and 1 XC) in mouse, whereas there
are 11 receptors for CCLs, 6 for CXCLs, 1 for CX3CL, and
1 for XCL in human and mouse. Only 11 chicken chemokines including 4 CXC, 6 CC, and 1 XC and seven
chicken chemokine receptors including 2 CXCR and 5
CCR have been reported in the literature [12-23]. Chicken
chemokines share low sequence identity with mammals
[24]. Therefore, it was very difficult to assign chicken
chemokines to a specific mammalian counterpart based
on sequence data alone. Because of limited sequence similarity, most of the reported chicken chemokines were not
named in accordance with the systematic nomenclature of
mammalian chemokines. The newly available chicken
draft genome sequence and a large number ESTs allow
systematic identification and annotation of chicken
chemokine and cognate receptor genes. The objectives of
this study were to systematically identify chemokine and
chemokine receptor genes in the chicken genome, to
name these genes according to existing systematic nomenclature, and to make ligand-receptor binding inferences
based on comparative sequence analysis. The systematic
nomenclature for these chicken genes was based on the
phylogenetic trees and syntenies of chicken, human, and
mouse genes, and ligand-receptor binding inferences were
according to [37] and [38].

Results
Chicken chemokines and chemokine receptors
In addition to the 11 previously reported, 12 new chicken
chemokine were identified. These include 7 new CC
chemokines named CCL1L1 (BX935885), CCL3L1
(CF258095), CCL/MCP-L2 (CK610423), CCL/MCP-L3
(CK610627), CCL17 (BI067703), CCL19 (BX929857),
and CCL21 (CR522995), 4 new chicken CXC chemokines
named CXCL13a (BX262175), CXCL13b (BX264625),
and CXCL13c (CR352598), CXCL15 (BX929947), and 1
CX3CL1 chemokine (assembled from CR389767,
BI066258, BM426140, and our sequence: AY730688).
Eleven reported chicken genes were also named accordingly as CCL1L2 (L34552), CCL5 (ah294, AY037859),

Sequences with identical amino acid in at least 50% of chicken chemokines are highlighted in gray and conserved cysteine residues in dark gray.

CCL4L1 (MIP-1β, AJ243034), CCL/MCP-L1 (ah221,
AY037860/ BX933162), CCL16 (k203, Y18692), CCL20
(ah189, AY037861), CXCL8a (cCAF, M16199), CXCL8b
(K60, Y14971), CXCL12 (SDF-1, BX936268), CXCL14
(JSC, AF285876), and XCL1 (lymphotactin, AF006742).
In summary, there are 13 CCL, 8 CXCL, 1 CX3CL, and 1
XCL genes identified in the chicken genome. The information used for the nomenclature is shown in the comparative genomic maps and phylogenetic trees.
Chicken chemokine amino acid sequence alignment
shows that all chicken CC chemokines have four conserved cysteines with two adjacent cysteines at the N-terminus (Figure 1), whereas all chicken CXC chemokines
have the conserved four cysteines with the first two
cysteines separated by one amino acid (Figure 2). Both
chicken CCLs and CXCLs show higher degrees of
sequence similarity to each other in the signal peptide
sequences and sequence regions containing the last two

cysteines. Chicken CXCL8a, CXCL8b, and newly identified chemokine CXCL15 contain the ELR (Glu-Leu-Arg)
motif. Only one chicken CX3C chemokine was found
(Figure 3). The number of amino acid residues between
conserved cysteines in all chemokines is highly conserved
between chicken and human (Table 1).
Chicken chemokines have limited amino acid sequence
similarity compared to their human counterparts. Generally, chicken CXC chemokines share 27 to 60% amino
acid identity with their human homologs except for
CXCL12, which share 73% identity with human CXCL12.
The length of chicken chemokine CXCL polypeptides
ranges from 95 to 107 amino acids. Compared to their
human homologs, chicken CXCL chemokine amino acid
sequences are shorter except for chicken CXCL8a,
CXCL8b, and CXCL12, which are 4, 5, 12 amino acids
longer than their respective human homologs. In contrast,
the sequence identities between human and chicken CCL

Alignment of amino acid sequences of chicken chemokine CXC subfamily
Alignment of amino acid sequences of chicken chemokine CXC subfamily. Alignment gaps are indicated by dashes.
Sequences with identical amino acid in at least 50% of chicken chemokines are highlighted in gray and conserved cysteine residues in dark gray. The conserved ELR motifs are underlined.

chemokines are generally lower than those for CXCL
chemokines, ranging from 25 to 56%. Chicken chemokine CCL polypeptides have 89 to 108 amino acids.
Chicken CCL1L2, CCL5, and CCL17 have the same amino
acid length as their human counterparts. Chicken CCL4L1
is shorter than corresponding human CCL4, whereas
chicken CCL1L1, CCL3L1, CCL19, and CCL20 are longer
than the corresponding human CCLs. These differences in
length between human and chicken chemokines are
mostly in the N- and C- termini.
Chicken CX3CL1 encodes 441 amino acids, longer than
all mammalian CX3CL1 examined. It shares 20, 22, 20,
and 22% amino acid identity with human, mouse, rat,
and monkey CX3CL1, respectively. Sixty-six amino acid
residues in chicken CX3CL1 are identical to residues in
mammals, but the sequence identity between mammals
is, as expected, much higher than that between chickens
and mammals (Figure 3). There are more identical amino
acids between chicken and mammals at both ends of the
sequences.
Unlike the chemokines, all the chicken chemokine receptor genes were aligned with non-chicken chemokine
receptor reference genes in the chicken genome browser.
There was at least one chicken EST sequence aligned to
each receptor gene except for CCR4. In addition to 7
reported receptors, 7 new chicken chemokine receptors
were identified and named as CCR4 (predicted sequences:

ENSGALT00000019505.1),
CCR6
(CV039916,
BU451770, and CK987456), CCR7 (predicted sequence:
chr27_random_59.1), CCR8a (AJ720982), CXCR2
(BX258468), CXCR5 (AJ450829), CX3CR1 (CF252942,
BU204148, and AJ443633). In contrast to chicken chemokines, chicken chemokine receptors share significant
amino acid identity with their human receptor counterparts. The percents of amino acid identity between
chicken and human chemokine receptors range from 48
to 81%. The lengths of these chicken receptors range from
335 to 382 amino acids. The complete sequence of
chicken CXCR2 is unknown due to a sequence gap in the
chicken genome sequence. The CXCR2 EST and a partial
genome sequence contain the last 170 amino acids of the
C-terminus.
Fourty-four amino acid residues were highly conservated
(>85% homologies) among all chicken chemokine receptors (Figure 4). These receptors all have seven transmembrane helices and three extracellular loops. Of the seven
transmembrane helices, helix 1 and 7 show higher degrees
of sequence similarity than the other helices. The similarity between the extracellular domains of the chicken
receptors is lower, but all have a conserved cysteine residue. In contrast, the intracellular domains (except at the
C-terminus) generally have higher degrees of sequence
similarity than the extracellular domains. The second
intracellular domains contain a highly conserved DRYLAIV sequence.

that the organization of the chemokine genes was generally conserved between chickens and mammals (Figure 5
and 6). Chicken CC and CXC chemokines are located on
Chromosomes 1, 4, 6, 9, 13, 19, and Z. Like human and
mouse, there are two large clusters in the chicken genome,
located on Chromosome 19 and containing 9 CCL genes.
Two CCL1-like (CCL1L1 and 2) and three chicken MCPlike (CCL/MCP-L1, L2, and L3) genes related to human
and mouse MCPs, such as CCL2, 7, 8, 11, and 13, are in
one cluster (Figure 5A), and CCL5, CCL16, CCL3L1, and
CCL4L1 genes in another cluster (Figure 5B). Another
CCL cluster is located on Chromosome Z containing two
genes, CCL19 and CCL21 (Figure 5C). Two CXCL gene
clusters are located on Chromosome 4 and contained 6
genes, two CXCL8 (CXCL8a and b) and one CXCL15
genes in one cluster (Figure 6A) and three CXCL13
(CXCL13a, b, and c) genes in another (Figure 6B).
Chicken shares the syntenies with mouse and human in
all these regions. There is one composite cluster containing one CX3CL1 and one CCL17 genes (Figure 6E). Synteny was conserved in chicken on one side of this cluster.
Chicken CCL20, CXCL12, CXCL14, and XCL1 are individually located on Chromosomes 9 (Figure 5D), 6 (Figure
6C), 13 (Figure 6D), and 1 (Figure 6F), respectively, and
the syntenies were highly conserved between chicken,
mouse, and human in these four locations. Mammalian
CCL25, CCL28, and CXCL16 were not found in the
chicken genome, although the syntenies associated with
CCL25 and CCL28 were also conserved in chickens. A
number of human chemokines including CCL2, 7, 8, 11,

15, 18, 23, 24, and 26, CXCL1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, and
11 in chemokine clusters that share syntenies with
chicken clusters on Chromosome 4, and 19 were not
found in the chicken genome, indicating gene duplications in mammals.
Chemokine receptor genes were also highly conserved
between chicken, human, and mouse, and were similarly
clustered. The largest cluster of chicken chemokine receptors was found on Chromosome 2, where 5 receptor genes
(CCR2, CCR5, CCR8L1, CCR9, and XCR1) were identified. Another cluster on Chromosome 2 contains CCR4,
CCR8, and CX3CR1 genes. Chicken CXCR1 and CXCR2
are also clustered as in mammals, but the chromosomal
segment is unknown. The remaining CCR and CXCR
genes are individually located on Chromosomes 3
(CCR6), 27 (CCR7), 7 (CXCR4), and 24 (CXCR5). Several
human chemokine receptors, such as CCR1, CCR3,
CCR10, CXCR3, and CXCR6 were not found in the
chicken genome, though the syntenies associated with
these receptors are present in the chicken genome.
Gene structure
According to the chicken genome sequence, chicken
chemokine genes share typical three-exon CC and fourexon CXC gene structures with mammals except for
CXCL13a and CXCL13b, which have only three exons.
Chicken chemokine genes are shorter than the corresponding human genes due to shorter introns in chickens.
The gene structure of chemokine receptors was also conserved between chicken and mammals. The EST
sequences indicate that chicken chemokine receptor genes
could have up to 5 exons, though the complete sequences

Alignment of amino acid sequences of chicken chemokine receptors with human CCR1
Alignment of amino acid sequences of chicken chemokine receptors with human CCR1. Alignment gaps are indicated by dashes. Sequences with identical amino acid in at least 50% or 85% of the chicken chemokines are highlighted in gray
and dark gray, respectively. Asterisks represent the conserved cysteine residues. ED and ID denote extracellular and intracellular domains, respectively. Seven transmembrane spanning domains of chicken chemokine receptors were predicted using the
SMART program and these consensus domains are indicated with a box. The N-terminal sequence of chicken CXCR2 is currently unknown.

were not available. However, the expressed sequences
show that the amino acid sequences of identified chicken
receptors are mostly encoded in a single exon as are most
of the mammalian chemokine receptors. Chicken ESTs
aligned with the chicken genome sequence indicate that
these receptor mRNAs have approximately 2 kb of 5' UTR,
as do those found in humans.
Phylogenetic analyses and nomenclatures
The phylogenetic trees (Figure 7A,7B, and 8) show that
chicken CCL5, 16, 17, 19, and 20 and all seven CXCLs are
closely related to single specific human and/or mouse
chemokines. The phylogenetic trees together with the syntenies associated with these genes (Figure 5 and 6)
strongly indicate that these genes are the orthologs of
those found in mammals; therefore, they are named
accordingly. The phylogenetic results show that chickens
have two CXCL8 and three CXCL13 genes (only one copy
each in mammals), indicating gene duplications of these
genes in aves. One chicken CXCL related to mouse
CXCL15 but not to human CCLs is named as cCXCL15,
which is also supported by the synteny of the chemokine
cluster (Figure 6A). Chicken CCL21 is named according to
relatedness to the human and mouse and the highly conserved synteny (Figure 5C). According to the phylogenetic
tree in Figure 7B, two directly linked chicken CCLs are
remotely related to human and mouse CCL1. The synteny
associated with these genes also indicates that they may be
CCL1-like genes (Figure 5A); therefore, they are named as
CCL1L1 and CCL1L2. Three closely related chicken CCLs
that are directly linked to the CCL1-like genes are related
to a group of clustered human and mouse MCP CCLs (2,
7, 8, 11, and 13) in the phylogenetic tree. The synteny and
phylogenetic tree do not provide information to a specific
mammalian ortholog, though these three chicken genes
are somewhat more similar to human CCL13 and mouse
CCL2. The results indicate that these genes are chicken
MCP-like (Figure 5A and 7B); therefore, they are named as
CCL/MCP-like (CCL/MCP-L1, -L2, and -L3). A chicken
CCL gene that is directly linked to CCL16 and CCL5 (Figure 5B) is distantly related to chicken CCL5 in the tree.
This gene has been reported as MIP-1β-like chemokine
[13], which is CCL4 in humans and mouse. Therefore, it
is named as CCL4L1 in order to conform to the report.
Another CCL in this cluster that does not display relatedness to other CCLs in the phylogenetic tree (Figure 7B) is
named as CCL3L1 because this chemokine displays highest sequence similarity to a human CCL3-like chemokine,
and it shares synteny with human CCL3 genes (Figure
5B). Overall, CXCLs are more conservative among
chicken, human, and mouse than CCLs.

Chicken chemokine receptors can also be named according to mammalian nomenclature based on phylogenetic
analysis (Figure 7) and syntenies. The genetic distances

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/45

appear to be shorter between chicken and mammalian
chemokine receptors than those between chicken and
mammalian chemokines, which probably due to highly
conserved transmembrane domains in these receptors.
Chicken CCR4, CCR6, CCR7, CCR9, CXCR2, CXCR4,
CXCR5, CX3CR1, and XCR1 are closely related to a mammalian ortholog based on the phylogenetic analysis.
There are two distantly related (relative to the distance
between mouse and human CCR8) CCR8 genes in chickens. The one closer to human CCR8 is named as CCR8a
and the other as CCR8b. There are also two chicken CCRs
closely related to human and mouse CCR2 and CCR5, but
the phylogenetic analysis could not distinguish them as
either CCR2 or CCR5. Because these two receptors are
located in a conserved chromosomal region on chicken,
human, and mouse chromosomes, these two chicken
CCRs were named as CCR2 and CCR5 based on the synteny in which CCR2 is closer to XCR1 than CCR5.
In summary, 23 chemokine and 14 chemokine receptor
genes were identified from the chicken genome in this
study. Many chicken genes display high degrees of similarity with their human and mouse orthologs in terms of
gene structure, sequence homology, and synteny. Chicken
has significantly fewer CCLs, CXCLs, CCRs, and CXCRs
than mammals, but it has the same number of CX3C, XC,
and cognate receptors as mouse. The results of phylogenetic analyses generally agree with the comparative chromosomal locations and syntenies of the genes. The
independent nomenclature of chicken chemokines and
chemokine receptors suggests that the chicken may have
ligand-receptor pairings similar to mammals. The organization of these genes suggests that there were a substantial
number of these genes present before divergence between
aves and mammals and more gene duplications of CC,
CXC, CCR, and CXCR subfamilies in mammals than in
aves after the divergence.

Discussion
We systematically searched for chicken chemokine and
chemokine receptor genes in the recently available draft
chicken genome sequence. Without this information, it
may have taken years to find chicken chemokines and
their receptors. The independent nomenclature of chicken
chemokines and chemokine receptors and mammalian
chemokine-receptor binding information suggest that
most of the genes have been identified. One exception
was CCL25, the only known ligand of CCR9 in mammals,
which was not found in this study though its receptor was
identified. Likewise, CXCL14, and CXCL15 were identified in both chickens and mice, but their receptors are
unknown; therefore, it is very likely that there are
additional chicken chemokine and chemokine receptor
genes in the chicken genome.

Although most of the systematic nomenclature of the
chicken genes was unambiguous based on both phylogenetic trees and syntenies, the information that was used to
name seven chicken CCLs as CCL1L1, CCL1L2, CCL3L1,
CCL4L1, CCL/MCP-L1, CCL/MCP-L2, and CCL/MCP-L3
and to distinguish two chicken chemokine receptors into
CCR2 and CCR5 is inadequate. CCR2 and CCR5 are
closely related and tightly linked in the human, mouse,
and chicken genomes. The phylogenetic analysis indicates
these genes were duplicated after the divergence between
mammals and aves. Chicken CCL/MCP-L1, -L2, and -L3
were related to a group of clustered mouse and human
MCP CCLs; therefore, specific cognate receptors must be
tested to distinguish them. In humans, the chemokines of
this MCP group and MIPs, such as CCL3, CCL4, and
CCL5, can bind to more than one receptor, such as CCR1,
2, 3, and/or 5, but not both CCR2 and CCR5. CCR1 and
CCR3 were not found in the chicken genome and probably are not present in the species. Therefore, chicken
CCR2 and CCR5 may be two receptors that recognize
these two groups of CCL chemokines, such as CCR2 for
MCPs and CCR5 for MIPs. Interestingly, two CCL1 like
(CCL1L1 and CCL1L2) and two CCL1 receptor (CCR8a
and CCR8b) genes were found in the chicken genome.
The ligand-receptor binding for these four genes can not
be determined in this study. Nerveless, the names
assigned based on comparative analysis in this study may
prove useful in order to apply the functional and
physiological knowledge from other species to chickens.
Further lab testing must be carried out to confirm the ligand-receptor binding and to understand their biological
functions.
Chicken chemokine ESTs are highly represented in the
EST database. There are several ESTs aligned to each identified chicken chemokine gene in the UCSC Genome
browser. The sequences assembled from ESTs probably
contained most, if not all, of the full-length chemokine
mRNA sequences. Promoter sequences with a typical
TATAA were detected with promoter prediction software
(data not shown). However, there were only a few ESTs
that partially cover chicken chemokine receptor genes.
Some of these EST contain translation start sites. These
EST sequences and reported complete coding sequences
indicate that the amino acid sequences of chicken chemokine receptors are mostly encoded in one exon. The predicted amino acid sequences were of the expected length
and aligned very well with the coding sequences of nonchicken reference genes in the UCSC genome browser.
The conserved gene structure of this receptor family and
high sequence similarity between chicken and mammals
suggest that the predicted coding sequences were very
accurate, especially for those with ESTs containing translation start sites. CCR4 is the only predicted gene that does
not have a matching EST and CXCR2 is the only identified

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/45

gene with partial sequence. Further study including
sequencing expressed sequences is needed to confirm
these genes.

Conclusion
Based on the organization, syntenies, and phylogenetic
trees of chicken, mouse, and human chemokine and
chemokine receptor genes, we conclude that there may be
a substantial number of chemokine and cognate receptor
genes before divergence between aves and mammals. The
presence of a few chicken chemokine and chemokine
receptor paralogs and orthologs of the mammalian genes
indicated that most chicken chemokine and the receptor
genes shared common ancestors with the human and
mouse genes. There were significantly more gene duplications of CC, CXC, CCR, and CXCR subfamilies in mammals than in aves after the divergence of mammals and
aves. The mammalian and chicken genome sequences and
the genes identified in this study can be used for further
investigation of the molecular evolution of these gene
families and as a model for the study of the divergence
between aves and mammals. Avian and mammalian species may share similar chemokine-receptor binding patterns. The results of this study may be used as functional
inferences for these chicken genes before they are experimentally tested.

Methods
Gene identification
To identify syntenies, genes closely linked to human and
mouse chemokines were identified and localized on the
chicken genome using the UCSC genome browser [25].
Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) and chicken mRNA
sequences in the corresponding chromosomal regions
were then identified and, if necessary, assembled with the
CAP3 program [26,27]. These sequences were aligned
with the corresponding chicken genomic sequence and
any deletions or insertions corrected. Sequences were then
submitted to ORF Finder (Open Reading Frame Finder)
[28] and the open reading frames were used as queries in
BLASTP [29,30] searches against the non-redundant protein database in Genbank [31]. Sequences that produced
significant alignments with chemokines were identified as
putative chicken chemokine sequences. To identify
chicken chemokine receptors, all sequences of putative
chicken chemokine receptors including ESTs, mRNAs,
and predicted sequences were retrieved from the UCSC
Genome Browser. The identified ESTs were used to determine the translation start sites for the receptors. If the
translation start sites could not be determined from ESTs,
translation start sites were based on the most likely predicted sequences from non-chicken reference genes in the
UCSC Genome Browser.

Sequence analyses
Complete amino acid sequences of currently known
human and mouse chemokines were retrieved from Genbank. The amino acid sequences of all putative chicken
chemokines were predicted based on the open reading
frames of the expressed nucleotide sequences (ESTs or
mRNAs). The amino acid sequences were grouped according to CC, CXC, and CX3C motifs and aligned using the
ClustalW program [32,33]. The similarity of the amino
acid sequences was determined based on alignments with
the most likely human or mouse orthologs. Human CCR1
was included in the multiple alignments of chicken chemokine receptors for comparison. The seven transmembrane domains were predicted using the SMART program
[34].

Phylogenetic analyses of protein sequences of chicken,
human, and mouse chemokines and chemokine receptors
were based on the amino acid sequences using neighborjoining with options selected for bootstrap test, pairwise
deletion and Poisson correction, using MEGA3 [35,36].
For ligand-receptor inference, the first 20 amino acids
(leading peptide) of all chemokines were removed before
the phylogenetic analysis and chicken CCLs were divided
into two groups, one group located on Chromosomes 4
and 19 and the other from other chromosomes. Syntenies, phylogenetic trees, and sequence homologies were
the combined information used for naming chicken
chemokines and their cognate receptors according to the
recommendations of the IUIS/WHO Subcommittee on
Chemokine Nomenclature [37]. These chicken genes were
named according to their closest predicted human or
mouse orthologs if all information supports the nomenclature. If there was more than one chicken gene similar to
a human and/or mouse gene, these gene was named as in
the human and/or mouse followed by a letter with alphabet order. If a specific human or mouse ortholog could
not be reliablely determined, the chicken genes were
named according to a closest human or mouse ortholog
followed by an "L" and a number based on the information available. This nomenclature also used the existing
systematic names reported in the literature to avoid
confusion.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing
Chicken EST or mRNA sequences were identified for all
chemokine genes. All sequences contained complete
putative open reading frames except for CX3CL1. However, partial chicken CX3CL1 gene sequences (BM426140,
BI066258, and CR389767) were identified, with a gap of
123 nucleotides between the ESTs. Forward (TGTGACATCGGGAGTCGCTAC)
and
reverse
(AAAATCCCCAGCGTTTGCTACT) PCR primers were used to
amplify across the gap using cDNA prepared from white
blood cells. PCR was performed as follows: An initial
denaturation step at 94°C for 2 min and 35 cycles of
denaturation, annealing, and extension at 94°C for 30
sec, 59°C for 45 sec, and 72°C for 1 min., and a final
extension step was carried out at 72°C for 10 min. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed from amplified
PCR products using BioMax spin-50 mini-columns (Millipore, Billerica, MA). BigDye terminator cycle sequencing
reaction kits and an ABI Prism 377XL DNA Sequencer
(Applied Biosystems) were used for DNA sequencing.

Authors' contributions
JW collected most of the data and drafted the manuscript.
DLA contributed to the interpretation of the data and final
approval of the manuscript. AY performed the DNA
sequencing and assisted with the preparation of the manuscript. SHS and YJ designed computer programs to
search chicken chemokine sequences in chicken EST database. JJZ provided the conception and design of the study,
collected some of the data, conducted phylogenetic analysis, and revised the manuscript.

Acknowledgements
The authors sincerely thank Mr. Suresh Xavier for his assistance in setting
up the chicken EST database for this study. This research project was financially supported by Life Science Task Force at Texas A&M University. This
research work should also be credited to all persons including the funding
agencies who contributed to chicken genome and EST sequencing and the
genome browser. Without the chicken genetic information, this research
would have taken years and substantial funds to accomplish. The authors
also greatly appreciate the inputs from the reviewers of this manuscript.
