Abstract
Background: The mitochondria of contemporary organisms contain fewer genes than the
ancestral bacteria are predicted to have contained. Because most of the mitochondrial proteins are
encoded in the nucleus, the genes would have been transferred from the mitochondrion to the
nucleus at some stage of evolution and they must have acquired cis-regulatory elements compatible
with eukaryotic gene expression. However, most of such processes remain unknown.
Results: The ribosomal protein L6 gene (rpl6) has been lost in presently-known angiosperm
mitochondrial genomes. We found that each of the two rice rpl6 genes (OsRpl6-1 and OsRpl6-2) has
an intron in an identical position within the 5'-untranslated region (UTR), which suggests a
duplication of the rpl6 gene after its transfer to the nucleus. Each of the predicted RPL6 proteins
lacks an N-terminal extension as a mitochondrial targeting signal. Transient assays using green
fluorescent protein indicated that their mature N-terminal coding regions contain the
mitochondrial targeting information. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed that OsRpl6-2
expresses considerably fewer transcripts than OsRpl6-1. This might be the result of differences in
promoter regions because the 5'-noncoding regions of the two rpl6 genes differ at a point close to
the center of the intron. There are several sequences homologous to the region around the 5'UTR of OsRpl6-1 in the rice genome. These sequences have characteristics similar to those of the
transposable elements (TE) belonging to the PIF/Harbinger superfamily.
Conclusion: The above evidences suggest a novel mechanism in which the 5'-UTR of the
transferred mitochondrial gene was acquired via a TE. Since the 5'-UTRs and introns within the 5'UTRs often contain transcriptional and posttranscriptional cis-elements, the transferred rice
mitochondrial rpl6 gene may have acquired its cis-element from a TE.

Background
Mitochondria are thought to be descendants of endosymbiotic bacteria that entered into the host cell [1]. The mitochondria
of
contemporary
organisms
contain
considerably fewer genes than the ancestral bacteria are
predicted to have contained. Thousand or more mitochondrial proteins are predicted to be encoded in the
nucleus [2,3]. Such the nucleus-encoded genes are transcribed from eukaryotic promoters, followed by translation into proteins by cytosolic ribosomes. In many cases,
the proteins are synthesized as precursors having N-terminal extensions (presequences), which act as mitochondrial targeting signals. Most of these genes would have
been transferred from the mitochondrion to the nucleus
at some stage of evolution although some genes may have
been recruited from other sources [4]. The transferred
mitochondrial genes must have acquired cis-regulatory
elements compatible with eukaryotic gene expression
(e.g., promoters, enhancers, poly (A) signals and
sequences for mitochondrial targeting signals) because
mitochondrial gene expression is mainly prokaryotic.
However, most of the processes for the gene activation
remain unknown.
Mitochondrial gene content is highly variable depending
on the taxa studied. The mammalian mitochondrial
genome is conserved and constant all over the groups,
whereas within Tracheophyta (higher plants), the
genomes exhibit differential gene losses, indicating that
gene transfer to the nucleus is an ongoing process during
the evolution of Magnoliophyta (angiosperms) [5]. Typical such cases are the ribosomal protein genes, showing
more frequent gene-loss than other types of mitochondrial gene in many angiosperm species. For example, a
sequence homologous to the ribosomal protein L6 gene
(rpl6) is absent from all known angiosperm mitochondrial genomes [6-8], whereas the corresponding sequence
is encoded in the mitochondrial genomes of lower plants
[9]. The sequences of the nucleus-encoded rpl6 gene have
recently been identified in the complete Arabidopsis
nuclear genome [6,8] and the draft rice nuclear genome
[8]. However, detailed analysis has not yet been performed. We previously reported the loss or dysfunction of
several ribosomal protein genes in the complete rice mitochondrial genome [10]. We have also isolated several
genes that had been transferred from the mitochondrion
to the nucleus in rice [11-14]. Previous studies, including
ours, have revealed frequencies of gene transfer events, the
origins of sequence elements, and a few possible mechanisms involved [5]. For examples, the rps10 gene has
undergone numerous independent gene transfer events
during recent angiosperm evolution [15]. Presequences
for rice rps11-1, Arabidopsis sdh3 and carrot rps10 genes
seem to have been copied from those for the atp2, hsp70
and hsp22 genes, respectively [11,15,16]. Common use of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/314

a presequence in different proteins via alternative splicing
has also been found in maize and rice [12,17]. Chromosomal recombinations would have been involved in the
gain of a promoter for rice rpl27 gene [18]. Genes are
sometimes divided into pieces or functionally replaced: a
coding region of rpl2 gene has been divided into 5'- and
3'-parts in dicots, either or both of which have been transferred to the nucleus in some species [19]; mitochondrial
rps13 and rps8 genes have been replaced by duplicated
copies of chloroplast (rps13) and cytosolic counterparts
(rps15A), respectively [6]. However, despite these examples, it is mostly unclear how the sequence elements compatible with eukaryotic expression were successfully
moved and then joined with the transferred mitochondrial genes.
In this study, we identified and characterized the rice rpl6
gene. The release of the complete nuclear sequence of rice
[20] and its fine genome annotation [21] enabled us to
survey the genes and their genomic environment in detail.
Based on this information, two copies of rice rpl6 gene
(OsRpl6-1 and OsRpl6-2) were identified in the rice
genome. Sequence comparison of the two rpl6 genes
strongly suggests a duplication of the rpl6 gene via
genomic DNA rather than two separate gene transfer
events. Although the sequences of the two rpl6 copies are
homologous within the coding regions and have similar
mitochondrial targeting properties, OsRpl6-1 was
expressed to a greater extent than OsRpl6-2. A region
around the 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of OsRpl6-1 is
conserved in several other rice sequences. Interestingly,
this conserved region has characteristics similar to those
of class II transposable elements (TEs). It is well established that numerous TEs are present in eukaryotic
nuclear genomes and that some of them affect genomic
rearrangement and gene expression via translocation [22].
The TE within OsRpl6-1 would have been involved in the
acquisition of the 5'-UTR, which may be responsible for
the difference in the amount of transcripts produced by
the two rpl6 genes. The significance of TEs for the activation of transferred mitochondrial sequence and the evolution of such processes are discussed.

Results
Identification of two copies of the mitochondrial rpl6 gene
in the rice genome
A BLAST search of the complete rice nuclear sequence [20]
identified two rpl6 sequences, OsRpl6-1 and OsRpl6-2 (Fig.
1A). OsRpl6-1 is a newly described rice rpl6 gene, whereas
the sequence of OsRpl6-2 corresponds to that of a previously reported one [8]. The OsRpl6-1 and OsRpl6-2 genes
are assigned to chromosomes (Chrs) 3 and 8 as loci
Os03g0725000 and Os08g0484301, respectively, in the
Rice Annotation Project Database (RAP-DB) Build 4 [21].
Each of the OsRpl6-1 and OsRpl6-2 genes is transcribed

because cDNA sequence corresponding to each gene is
found in the database [representative GenBank accession
nos. AK119694 and CI260120 for OsRpl6-1 and OsRpl6-2,
respectively] (Fig. 1A, thick pink arrow joined with thin
pink broken line). Each gene has an intron in an identical
position within the 5'-UTR (Fig. 1A), as is the case for Arabidopsis rpl6 [8]. The coding regions of the two rice rpl6
genes, each of which is predicted to encode a protein consisting of 103 amino acids, have 92% nucleotide sequence
identity. Because the 3'-terminal regions of the intron
showed 65% identity in the two rice rpl6 (Fig. 1A, shaded
region), they were probably generated by a duplication
event via genomic DNA after gene transfer to the nucleus,
rather than by two separate transfer events.
Mitochondrial targeting of OsRpl6 gene products
In contrast to the mitochondrial RPL6 proteins of lower
plants [9], the predicted proteins of the two rice rpl6 genes
did not contain N-terminal extensions for presequences.

Although the Arabidopsis rpl6 gene [8] and all the other
Spermatophyta (seed plants) rpl6 cDNAs in the database
also lack any coding capacity for presequences (data not
shown), localization of the RPL6 protein has not been
studied. We examined the subcellular localization of RPL6
using green fluorescent protein (GFP). A construct, in
which the N-terminal coding region of OsRpl6-1 was fused
to synthetic GFP cDNA [23], exhibited fluorescence in
particles of about 1 μm in diameter (Fig. 2A, left panel).
These particles coincided with the fluorescence of a mitochondrial-specific dye, MitoTracker Red (Fig. 2A, center
and right panels), indicating that the protein was
imported into the mitochondria. A construct containing
the N-terminal coding region of OsRpl6-2 gave similar
results (Fig. 2B). In contrast, a construct containing the Cterminal coding region of OsRpl6-1 did not localize proteins to the mitochondria (Fig. 2C). These results indicate
that the mature N-terminal coding regions of rice RPL6
proteins are important for mitochondrial localization.

coding region of OsRpl6-2 was fused to 5'-upstream position of GFP, and (C) the C-terminal coding region of OsRpl6-1 was
fused to 3'-downstream position of GFP. Representative images are shown. Left: GFP fluorescence. Center: fluorescence of a
mitochondrial-specific dye, MitoTracker Red. Right: merging of both signals. Scale bar = 20 μm. In the right panel of Figure 2A,
some of the GFP fluorescence within a small cell behind the central cell did not co-localize with mitochondria. The GFP fluorescence from the behind cell would have been overexposed, probably because its GFP expression had been much more
enhanced than that in the central cell.

Differential expression of rice rpl6 genes
We examined the transcription of the OsRpl6-1 and
OsRpl6-2 genes using reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR).
Because of difficulty in designing primers specific for each

rpl6 gene, OsRpl6-1 and OsRpl6-2 cDNAs were amplified
using a common primer pair, P7/P8 (Fig. 1A; Table 1), followed by restriction digestion to distinguish between their
products (see Methods). The RT-PCR analysis showed that

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:314

amplification of OsRpl6-2 cDNA was much lower than
that of OsRpl6-1 cDNA (Fig. 3A, lanes L, S and R). This
indicates that the two rpl6 genes differ in the amount of
transcripts produced.
The 5'-UTR of OsRpl6-1 is homologous to various rice
sequences
In contrast to the similar coding sequences of the two rpl6
copies, their 5'-noncoding regions differ near the center of
the intron (Fig. 1A). A database search was conducted to
determine the origin of these 5'-sequences. There are several sequences homologous the region around the 5'-UTR
of OsRpl6-1 (Figs. 1B and 4, blue color) in the rice
genome. These sequences are distributed on all rice chromosomes (Fig. 4A, designated Chr xx according to their
chromosomal positions). Additional homologous
sequences may be revealed when divergent and fragmented sequences are taken into account. The homology
starts upstream from the 5'-end of OsRpl6-1 cDNA (Fig.
4A, bent arrow) and extends into the 5'-part of the intron.
The Chrs 4a, 5c and 12a lack about 110, 180 and 60 bp of
sequences from the beginning of the conserved region,
respectively, probably because of subsequent deletion
events. The GT dinucleotide at the 5'-border of the OsRpl61 intron is also conserved in all the Chr sequences (Fig. 4,
empty box with pink outline), except for Chr 4a. Eleven of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/314

these sequences (Chrs 2a, 2b, 3b, 4b, 5c, 7a, 8b, 9a, 9c, 10
and 12a) are transcribed and spliced at this site because
their corresponding cDNAs are present in the database
[GenBank accession nos. AK102901, CI553335,
CI643836, CI733280, AK064122, AK107811, CI076773,
CI643779, CI241123, CI239335 and AK067455, respectively] (Fig. 4, asterisks in sequence names). In addition,
we detected another conserved DNA segment downstream of the above-mentioned homologies in 18
sequences (OsRpl6-1, and Chrs 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, 2c, 4a, 5b,
5c, 6a, 7a, 8b, 9a, 9b, 9c, 10, 11a and 12a) (Fig. 5). In
OsRpl6-1, this downstream conserved segment is located
near the center of the intron, upstream of the sequence
homologous in the two rpl6 genes (Fig. 1A, shaded
region).
Conserved regions have characteristics of a transposable
element (TE)
The upstream (Fig. 4) and downstream (Fig. 5) conserved
segments are presently annotated in the database as members of two separate nonautonomous TEs, MERMITE18F
and ECSR [24], respectively, but they have not been characterized in detail. Sequence alignment and analysis of the
two conserved segments revealed the following. (1) The
segments have a common terminal inverted repeat (TIR)
composed of a 15-bp consensus sequence, GGCCTTGT-

TCGGTTG (Figs. 4 and 5, thick yellow arrows). (2) A
potential 3-bp direct repeat occurs just outside of the TIR
(Figs. 4 and 5, small green arrows). Although not all direct
repeats were perfectly conserved between the ends of the
sequences, they could represent target-site duplications
(TSDs), which are generally caused by TE insertions. (3) A
database search using the sequences flanking the conserved segments detected two putative related-to-emptysites (RESites). The RESites are sequences that are homologous to TE-bearing sequences but lack the TE insertion,
which indicates the past movement of TEs and their TSD
sequences [25]. In one instance, the sequence flanking
Chr 2b was nearly identical to that of its RESite (Fig. S1A
in Additional file 1). In the second instance, high homology was evident between Chr 9c and its RESite, although
a few indels were observed (Fig. S1B in Additional file 1).
These results strongly suggest that the two conserved segments were moved as a single TE because the insertion of
two such segments in such close proximity and in the
same direction by two separate events is highly unlikely.
Classification of TEs associated with the 5'-UTR of
OsRpl6-1 as a member of the PIF/Harbinger superfamily
Among the putative TEs re-characterized in this study,
proteins predicted from the internal regions of Chrs 2c, 5c
and 9b had 78%–88% similarity to a transposase from OsPIF1 (data not shown). The Os-PIF1 is a rice homologue

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/314

of maize P instability factor alpha (PIFa), an active class II
DNA transposon [26]. The PIF family has recently been
associated with the nonautonomous miniature inverted
transposable element (MITE), Tourist [27]. In fact, the
consensus TIR sequence of the putative TEs observed in
our study (GGCCTTGTTCGGTTG) (Figs. 4 and 5) was
similar to that of Tourist-like MITEs in maize, barley and
Sorghum [27,28] and OsPIF families [29]. These results
indicate that the conserved sequence segments associated
with the 5'-UTR of OsRpl6-1 are a single TE belonging to
the PIF/Harbinger superfamily. Of these TEs, Chr 2c seems
to encode an entire transposase, whereas Chr 5c and 9b
may be pseudogenes because of lacking the complete coding region for transposase. The others, including one
within OsRpl6-1, are probably nonautonomous elements
because they did not contain ORFs nor did their predicted
proteins have significant homologies to any characterized
proteins in the given direction (data not shown).

Discussion
Based on the results of this study, we propose a model for
the gene transfer and subsequent events of rice rpl6 (Fig. 6).
1. Gene transfer of rpl6 from the mitochondrion to the
nucleus
It has been proposed that a mitochondrially encoded rpl6
gene had been transferred to the nucleus prior to the

3. Duplication of the nuclear rpl6 gene
The rpl6 gene would have been duplicated via genomic
DNA, resulting in two rpl6 copies (OsRpl6-1 and OsRpl62) on different chromosomes (Fig. 6, step 3). Although we
did not conduct Southern blot analysis to determine their
copy numbers, the presence of the two rpl6 copies in the
rice nucleus is probable because of the accuracy of rice
genome sequence data [20] and similarity to numerous
rpl6 cDNA sequences in the database (data not shown).
The duplication event seems to have occurred after the
split of the genus Oryza from the other monocots, followed by the occurrence of japonica and indica subspecies,
because cDNA sequences corresponding to OsRpl6-1 and
OsRpl6-2 are also present in the indica cultivar [their rep-

2. Gain of a mitochondrial targeting sequence and an
intron
Since neither of the proteins predicted from the two rice
rpl6 genes contained an apparent N-terminal extension
for a presequence, the targeting signal seems to have been
derived from sequence alterations within the mature Nterminal coding region (Fig. 6, step 2), as with the case of
rice rps10 [31]. The presence of an embedded targeting signal here was indicated by the results of GFP assays (Fig. 2).
During the GFP analysis, small aggregations were occasionally observed (data not shown). We speculate that the
efficiency of mitochondrial targeting varies according to
cellular or physiological conditions. Incomplete or slow
protein targeting has been observed in the sweet potato
ATPase δ-subunit with an atypical mitochondrial targeting signal [32]. At any rate, the acquisition of the targeting
signal would have occurred prior to the duplication event
because both rice RPL6 proteins have similar mitochondrial targeting abilities. This step may predate the common ancestor of seed plants because seed plants RPL6
proteins seem to lack a presequence as described. The 3'part of an intron would also have been acquired during
this step, based on the fact that both of the OsRpl6-1 and
OsRpl6-2 sequences share a similarity in the 3'-terminal
region of the intron (Fig. 1, shaded region).

emergence of angiosperms [7,8]. We assume that the
transfer already occurred in the common ancestor of seed
plants (Fig. 6, step 1) because the rpl6 gene is absent from
the mitochondrial genome of a gymnosperm, Cycas taitungensis [30]. In addition, rpl6 cDNAs are found from
gymnosperms Cryptomeria japonica, Cycas rumphii, Pinus
pinaster, Pseudotsuga menziesii and Zamia vazquezii in the
database [their representative accession nos. are
BY896644, CB092074, BX248809, CN638760 and
FD772805, respectively], although the presence of rpl6
cDNAs does not readily indicate the nuclear localization
of genes. This situation differs from the evolution of other
ribosomal protein genes, which underwent recent gene
transfer events during the course of angiosperm evolution
(e.g., rps10 gene) [15].

not shown). This assumption is supported by a maximum
likelihood (ML) tree based on the 59 nonredundant rpl6
cDNAs from 24 angiosperm genera (data not shown).
This ML tree also suggests relatively recent duplications in
Glycine, Hordeum, Ipomoea, Petunia and Triticum. Therefore, it is likely that multiple duplication events occurred
during angiosperm evolution.
4. Acquisition of the 5'-UTR of OsRpl6-1 via a TE
Despite their coding similarity, transcripts of OsRpl6-2
were much less abundant than those of OsRpl6-1 (Fig. 3).
The difference in the quantity of transcripts produced by
the rpl6 genes might be caused by differences in promoter
regions because their 5'-noncoding regions differ from a
point near the center of the intron (Fig. 1A). The most
striking findings of this study were that numerous
sequences homologous to the region around the 5'-UTR
of OsRpl6-1 were detected in the rice genome and that

they presumably belong to a TE family. One can raise a
question why numerous putative introns linked to the TEs
are spread in the rice genome. One speculation could be
that a TE was selected as part of the intron of a cellular
gene because it contained a functional element such as a
promoter or an enhancer, followed by amplification in
the rice genome via transpositions. Alternatively, a TE
might have selfishly been spread in the rice genome after
capture of the 5'-part of intron from an unknown gene
source. The evolutionary relationships of these TEs are
unclear because the presence of a number of indels in the
sequence alignment (Figs. 4 and 5) precludes fine phylogenetic analysis. These TEs might have been transposed at
a relatively early evolutionary stage because most of their
RESites are missing. This assumption does not contradict
the notion of ancient transfer of the rpl6 gene to the
nucleus [7,8]. However, the TE within OsRpl6-1 should
have been integrated after the duplication event of the rice
rpl6 gene (Fig. 6, step 4) because the OsRpl6-2 and Arabidopsis rpl6 genes lack such a sequence. The origin and
mode of acquisition of the OsRpl6-2 5'-UTR is unknown.
There is a Mutator-like element (MULE) within the 5'-nontranscribed spacer region of OsRpl6-1 (Figs. 1B and 4,
open triangle). This element seems to have been acquired
posteriorly. Such nested TE insertions are characteristic of
many kinds of TEs. We infer that this MULE has a minor
effect on the expression of OsRpl6-1 because it is not conserved among the contemporary transcribed TEs (Fig. 4,
asterisks in sequence names). Alternatively, the MULE
might act as an enhancer.

regulation of adjacent genes in rice [37]. We have not
determined which cis-acting element causes differences in
the amount of transcripts between the two rice rpl6 genes
(Fig. 3A). However, many reports have already established
that the 5'-UTR and intron within the 5'-UTR have promoter and enhancer activity. As an alternative hypothesis,
it is also possible to assume that the rice rpl6 gene gained
basal transcriptional machinery prior to the gene duplication event (Fig. 6, step 2) because both of the rice rpl6 copies are transcribed. In this case, the TE within OsRpl6-1
might act as an enhancer.
Despite some functional ambiguity, judging from the
lines of evidence presented here, our results constitute a
plausible explanation for the origin and acquisition of the
5'-noncoding region. The generality of the acquisition of
a 5'-UTR via a TE is unclear because of the paucity of
genomic information on rpl6 genes in other monocots
and because many TEs are often poorly conserved except
for TIRs and TSDs. In fact, we examined the structure of
the TEs that retain the entire TIR and are transcribed (Chrs
2a, 2b, 7a, 8b, 9a, 9c and 10), but failed to find any analogous case of OsRpl6-1. Their transcripts ended within a
region between the TIR (data not shown) and no association with any other proximal genes was predicted. Therefore, to our knowledge, the OsRpl6-1 is presently the only
example. Additional genomic data on other plant species
and further systematic searches may reveal analogous
cases of other transferred mitochondrial genes.

Conclusion
The 5'-UTR and intron within the 5'-UTR are generally
thought to contain cis-elements that regulate expression at
transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels: the former
involves promoter and enhancer activities and the latter
confers translational efficiency and mRNA stability
[33,34]. The evolutionary origins of noncoding regions
(e.g., 5'- and 3'-UTRs, promoters and introns) are mostly
unknown, as are those of nucleus-encoded mitochondrial
genes. Recently, topoisomerase I-mediated homologous
recombination has been proposed as a mechanism by
which the 5'-UTR was acquired in rice rpl27 [18]. In the
present report, we describe a novel mechanism for the
acquisition of a 5'-UTR via a TE. TEs sometimes transpose
in the vicinity of host genes, generating new coding
regions and changing gene expression [35]. Among the
TEs, MITEs may be sources of cis-acting regulatory elements because of their specific properties. First, MITEs are
much more prevalent than other types of TEs in plant
genomes. Second, they preferentially insert into genic
regions. Finally, MITEs might contain cis-acting elements.
Although most of such putative elements have not been
demonstrated experimentally, a MITE family that had provided a poly (A) signal has been reported [36]. In addition, it is noteworthy that insertions of a member of the
MITE family, mPing, may have caused the up- and down-

We have demonstrated the evolutionary origin and acquisition mechanism of the 5'-UTR of a transferred mitochondrial gene. We conclude that the 5'-UTR of the
transferred rpl6 gene was acquired via a TE. Since the 5'UTR and intron within the 5'-UTR generally contain transcriptional and posttranscriptional cis-elements, TEs may
have constituted sources of cis-elements for the transferred mitochondrial genes.

Methods
Database search and nucleotide sequence analyses
Sequences homologous to the rice rpl6 gene were sought
using the BLAST algorism in the National Center for Biotechnology Information http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
and the RAP-DB Build 4 http://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/[21]
databases and a rice rpl6 cDNA [GenBank accession no.
AU184578] as the initial query. No sequence filtering was
set. The intron position of each rpl6 gene was determined
by comparison between the cDNA sequence [accession
nos.: AK119694 and CI260120] and the corresponding
genomic sequence [locus tags: Os03g0725000 and
Os08g0484301]. RESites were detected using flanking
sequences immediately outside of the putative TEs as queries in BLAST searches, as described previously [25].

The locations of primers P1-P8 are shown in Figure 1A.
Primers P9 and P10 were designed from rice Actin sequences [39] as

Construction and visualization of GFP fusion proteins
Portions of OsRpl6-1 and OsRpl6-2 coding regions were
amplified by PCR using primer pairs P1/P2, P3/P4 and
P5/P6 (Fig. 1; Table 1). These primer pairs contained
regions encoding amino acid positions 1–52 of OsRpl6-1,
1–52 of OsRpl6-2 and 54–103 of OsRpl6-1, respectively.
Each amplified fragment was fused in-frame to 5'upstream or 3'-downstream of S65TsGFP cDNA (kindly
provided by Dr. Y. Niwa; [23]) as described previously
[31]. The transient expression of GFP fusion proteins in
tobacco BY-2 cells was visualized as described previously
[38] after staining with a mitochondria-specific dye,
MitoTracker Red (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
RT-PCR analysis
Total RNA was isolated from mature leaves, leaf sheaths
and roots of three-month-old rice plants (Oryza sativa
subsp. japonica cv. Nipponbare) using an RNeasy Plant
Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). One microgram of
total RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase I (Roche
Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). First-strand cDNAs were
synthesized using oligo (dT)18 primers and the Advantage
RT-for-PCR Kit (Takara Bio, Otsu, Japan). It was difficult
to design primers specific for each OsRpl6 gene because of
a GC-rich sequence in the 5'-region and an interspersed
repeat sequence in the 3'-UTR (data not shown). Therefore, OsRpl6-1 and OsRpl6-2 cDNAs were amplified using
a common primer pair, P7/P8 (Fig. 1; Table 1). After 27
and 30 cycles of PCR reaction, the products of each gene
were digested with DraI to distinguish between them (see
legend for Fig. 3). Rice Actin genes [39] were used as an
internal control.
