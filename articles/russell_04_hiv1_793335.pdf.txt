Abstract
During virus assembly, all retroviruses specifically encapsidate two copies of full-length viral
genomic RNA in the form of a non-covalently linked RNA dimer. The absolute conservation of this
unique genome structure within the Retroviridae family is strong evidence that a dimerized genome
is of critical importance to the viral life cycle. An obvious hypothesis is that retroviruses have
evolved to preferentially package two copies of genomic RNA, and that dimerization ensures the
proper packaging specificity for such a genome. However, this implies that dimerization must be a
prerequisite for genome encapsidation, a notion that has been debated for many years. In this
article, we review retroviral RNA dimerization and packaging, highlighting the research that has
attempted to dissect the intricate relationship between these two processes in the context of HIV1, and discuss the therapeutic potential of these putative antiretroviral targets.

Introduction
The dimeric feature of the retroviral RNA genome was
identified almost forty years ago. However, as with many
topics in retrovirology, interest in this area was heightened with the realization that the causative agent of AIDS
was a retrovirus. Since then, RNA and protein sequences
involved in genome dimerization have been identified for
a number of retroviruses, and the dimeric nature of the
retroviral genome is known to be important for various
critical events in the viral life cycle. These include reverse
transcription and recombination, as well as genome
encapsidation. To date, a number of informative reviews
have been published on retroviral RNA dimerization [13], genome packaging [3-7], and the role of nucleocapsid
(NC) protein in these activities [8,9]. More recently, a
comprehensive review was published that summarized
the contributions of in vitro analysis to the identification

of retroviral dimerization signals, and provided an overview of the HIV-1 5' untranslated region (UTR) structure
with reference to a number of proposed models [10].
Another, in this issue of Retrovirology, focuses on the different roles of different dimer linkage structures amongst
various retroviruses [11]. In this review, we will focus on
results from in vivo studies that provide insights into the
relationship between retroviral RNA dimerization and
packaging, and the biological relevance of these activities
to viral replication.

Retroviral RNA dimerization
The first evidence for the existence of a dimerized RNA
genome came in 1967 when it was shown that viral RNA
from each of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV), murine leukemia virus (MLV), and
mouse mammary tumor virus (MTV) displayed

sedimentation constants between 64S and 74S in sucrose
gradients [12]. Since these sedimentation constants and
corresponding molecular weights were much larger than
those of most other known viral RNAs, the structure of
these RNA genomes became a matter of great interest.
Experiments showing that the 62S RSV RNA species could
be converted to a 36S species by heat treatment suggested
a disaggregation of the 62S RNA into smaller RNAs, and
implied that the fast-sedimenting (62S) RSV RNA was
actually an aggregate of smaller (36S) RNAs [13]. The first
real understanding of this putative aggregate RNA structure came in 1975 when RNA from the endogenous feline
retrovirus, RD-114, was visualized by electron microscopy
(EM), and it was apparent that the 52S RNA molecule
existed as an extended single strand that contained a central Y- or T-shaped secondary structure [14]. It appeared
that this 52S molecule actually consisted of two half-size
molecules, joined together by the Y- or T-shaped structure,
which was termed rabbit ears (RE). It was later shown that
the RNA had a poly(A) sequence at each of the two free
ends. More importantly, this indicated that nucleotides
involved in this RE, or dimer linkage structure (DLS),
resided in the 5' region of the RNA genome [15]. Similar
structures were also reported for numerous other type C
RNA viruses [16-21]. The absolute conservation of a DLS
among retroviruses was strong evidence that the dimerization process must be critical to the retroviral life cycle.
With the discovery that the causative agent of AIDS was
also a retrovirus, inhibition of RNA dimerization was proposed as a possible therapy for HIV, and HIV-1 RNA
dimerization became an intensely studied topic.
Both in vivo and in vitro approaches have been used to
study retroviral RNA dimerization. The in vivo approach is
that whereby RNA is isolated from virions produced in tissue culture and then analyzed by native Northern blotting
[22]. The other method involves synthesis of short segments of viral RNA in vitro, and then studying the ability
of these fragments to form dimers. The HIV-1 DLS was
originally identified when it was shown that an in vitrotranscribed fragment of HIV-1 RNA could form two major
bands on a native gel after incubation at 37°C for 15 min
[23]. The lower band had the expected size of the RNA
fragment, while the upper band corresponded to a dimer.
In vivo evidence for a role of the NC protein in the dimerization process was already available [24], and this study
also showed that NC could bind to viral RNA and increase
the rate of dimerization of the RNA fragments in these in
vitro dimerization assays [25].
It was subsequently reported that an RNA fragment representing nt 1–311 of HIV-1 RNA (Mal strain; a chimera of
subtypes A and D) could not only form dimers, but that
RNAs containing these first 311 nt could dimerize 10
times faster than RNA sequences at positions 311–415

that were previously shown to be sufficient for HIV-1 RNA
dimerization [25]. Based on these results, the authors concluded that sequences upstream of the splice donor site
are involved in the dimerization process, and proposed
that sequences in this region somehow hastened the reaction. The key nucleotides involved in this RNA dimerization event make up a palindromic sequence, 274GUGCAC-279, between the PBS and the major splice
donor [26], and RNA sequences on both sides of this palindrome can form a stem-loop structure with the palindrome in the hairpin loop. Deletion of this stem-loop
motif (nt 265–287) completely abolished dimerization of
the 1–615 HIV-1 RNA fragment in vitro. The palindromic
region was termed the dimerization initiation site (DIS)
and it was proposed that this structural element could be
exploited for targeted antiviral therapy by antisense oligonucleotides [26]. These findings were later confirmed
when a 19 nt sequence upstream of the 5' major SD was
shown to be part of the HIV-1 RNA dimerization domain
(Lai strain; subtype B) [27], and it was found that in vitro
dimerization of a 224–402 nt RNA fragment was completely blocked by an antisense oligonucleotide that targeted the palindrome [28]. This led to a "loop-loop
kissing complex" [29] or "kissing-loop model" [27] of
HIV-1 RNA dimerization, in which the 6 nt palindromes
on each of the two monomeric RNA molecules interact
through Watson-Crick base-pairing. Purine residues flanking the palindrome were later shown to be intricately
involved in this initial interaction [30,31] which is
believed to shift the equilibrium toward the formation of
dimers, allowing the stems to melt and anneal to their
complementary sequences on the other RNA molecule,
thus forming the stable extended duplex (Fig. 1). This
model fits with the idea that immature virions contain a
less stable dimer involving only base-pairing of the palindromes, but that the mature virions contain a more stable
structure, the extended duplex. Subsequent phylogenetic
analysis of over 50 HIV-1, HIV-2, and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) nucleotide sequences showed an absolute conservation of a predictable structure similar to the
DIS, with the hallmark of the HIV-1 DIS motif being a 6
nt palindrome consisting of either a GCGCGC or a GUGCAC sequence [32,33]. Similar kissing-loop models have
also been proposed for a number of other retroviruses
[34-41].
Despite ample in vitro evidence supporting the above
model of dimer maturation, it was not yet known where
or when the RNA dimer was actually formed in vivo. However, native Northern blotting analysis of RNA from two
Moloney murine leukemia virus (MuLV) protease-negative (PR-) mutants displayed dimers that migrated more
slowly, and showed lower melting temperatures, than that
of wild-type [42]. It was therefore concluded that PR function is required for RNA maturation in MuLV. Similar

HIV-1 5'1RNA Structural Elements
HIV-1 5' RNA Structural Elements. Illustration of a working model of the HIV-1 5' UTR showing the various stem-loop
structures important for virus replication. These are the TAR element, the poly(A) hairpin, the U5-PBS complex, and stemloops 1–4 containing the DIS, the major splice donor, the major packaging signal, and the gag start codon, respectively.

Wamel [136])

experiments with a related virus also suggested that the
RNA maturation event required an intact, unsubstituted
Cys array within the NC domain [42]. On the basis of
these results, a maturation pathway was proposed for
MuLV in which Gag polyprotein molecules assemble into
a nascent virion containing an immature dimer. The particle would then be released from the cell, and once Gag is

cleaved by PR, NC would act on the immature dimer, converting it to the mature form.
Evidence for the role of NC in this dimer maturation process came when in vitro analysis showed that NC could convert the less thermostable dimers to a more stable
conformation [43]. Similar results were obtained by

others showing that HIV-1 NC could activate dimerization of a 77–402 nt fragment of HIV-1 Lai RNA, as well as
convert an unstable dimer, corresponding to the kissing
complex, to a stable one [44]. Taken together, these thermostability conversions seem to resemble the RNA maturations reported in vivo, and, in agreement with earlier
proposals [24], strongly suggest that NC is responsible for
the dimer maturation depicted in Fig. 1. Subsequent in
vivo analysis of a panel of HIV-1 NC mutants showed that
Cys-Ser substitution of amino acid residues within the second zinc finger decreased genomic RNA dimerization to
the same extent as disruption of the DIS [45]. This finding
confirmed the involvement of NC in the dimerization
process, and suggests that the kissing-loop model also
applies to the in vivo situation.

HIV-1 RNA packaging
Why a class of viruses would evolve to have such a unique
genomic structure is not entirely clear, but it is speculated
that the availability of two copies of the genome would be
advantageous for recombination during the complex
reverse transcription process, that is key to the retroviral
life cycle [46]. Indeed, the dimeric nature of the genome
is thought to be responsible for a high rate of recombination during infection [47-50]. Given that most dimerization signals overlap with known packaging elements, it
was naturally assumed that it is the RNA dimer that is specifically recognized for packaging in the case of retroviruses, and that this dimeric feature ensures proper
packaging of two copies of genomic RNA. A number of
studies have attempted to address this question of a link
between dimerization and packaging, but let us first
review several aspects of the HIV-1 RNA packaging
process.
The first studies aimed at identifying the HIV-1 RNA packaging signal found that deletion of RNA sequences
between the major splice donor (SD) and the gag coding
region (i.e. SL3 and adjacent sequences in Fig. 2)
decreased the levels of genomic RNA packaged into virions [51-53]. Since these sequences were downstream of
the major 5' SD, and therefore would not be found in any
spliced viral RNA species, it was plausible that this region
could be responsible for the selective packaging of
genomic RNAs. Analysis of the putative ψ locus from a
variety of retroviruses showed that these sequences had
the ability to direct the selective encapsidation of heterologous RNAs to which they had been linked artificially [5461]. In HIV-1, such autonomous packaging signals were
mapped to the regions extending 30–40 nt immediately
upstream and downstream of the gag start codon [62];
however, subsequent studies showed that RNA sequences
upstream of the 5' SD site also affected RNA packaging
[63]. It was also known that retroviral encapsidation
required trans-acting amino acid sequences in the Gag

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/1/1/23

protein [51,64-68], and several groups reported that HIV1 Gag and NC exhibit specific binding affinity for the HIV1 ψ site in vitro [23,69-72]. These findings, combined with
chemical and RNase accessibility mapping, as well as
computerized sequence analysis, led to the generation of
a model for the HIV-1 ψ site that comprised four independent stem-loops [73] (SL1-4 in Fig. 2). Three of these
hypothetical stem-loop structures were each shown to
serve as independent Gag binding sites, and were proposed to contribute individually to overall packaging efficiency. SL1, SL3, and SL4 were later shown to be critical
for packaging specificity in vivo [74,75]. Subsequent in
vitro analysis from another group demonstrated that the
major packaging signal is an extended bulged stem-loop
whose RNA conformation is altered upon interaction with
Gag [76]. However, more recent work indicates that SL2
and SL3 display much higher affinities for NC than SL1
and SL4 in vitro [77,78]. Based on these findings, a model
has been proposed to represent the initial complex
formed between the NC domains of assembling Gag molecules and the dimeric ψ region [79]. In this model, SL1 is
shown to form an RNA duplex between the two stands,
while SL4, instead of directly binding to Gag, contributes
additional RNA-RNA interactions that stabilize the tertiary structure of the ψ element. The RNA conformation
resulting from this folding pattern is thought to expose
SL2 and SL3 for high-affinity binding to Gag.
Despite the clear results obtained from simplified in vitro
studies such as those mentioned above, the SL1-4 region
alone is not sufficient to target RNA into HIV-1 virions in
vivo [80], and the minimal region required to confer
autonomous packaging activity actually maps to a larger
region covering the first 350–400 nt of the genome,
including ≈ 240 nt upstream of SL1 [81-84]. In agreement
with these studies, mutations that alter the stability of the
poly(A) hairpin stem region, or delete the upper part of
the hairpin, severely inhibited HIV-1 replication [85].
And, these deficits in replication correlated with reduced
RNA packaging levels in virions, suggesting that the formation of the poly(A) hairpin is necessary for normal
packaging of viral genomes. Subsequent research confirmed the importance of the poly(A) hairpin in the RNA
packaging process [86], and it was shown that similar disruption of base-pairing in the stem of the TAR element
also caused profound defects in packaging [81,86].
Finally, deletion analyses of RNA sequences between the
poly(A) hairpin and SL1 suggested that unspecified
sequences within the U5-PBS region also contribute to
HIV-1 RNA packaging [83,86]. Our group later showed
that GU-rich sequences in the lower stems of the poly(A)
hairpin and the U5-PBS complex contribute to both
dimerization and packaging [87].

The Kissing-Loop Model of HIV-1 RNA Dimerization
The Kissing-Loop Model of HIV-1 RNA Dimerization. HIV-1 RNA dimerization is initiated by a Watson-Crick basepairing interaction between two palindromes in the loops of SL1 on two monomeric genomic RNAs. This interaction forms
the loose unstable kissing-loop complex. Coincident with virus particle maturation, this unstable dimer is rearranged to form a
more stable extended duplex that involves a mechanism whereby the base-pairs in the stems melt and then re-anneal to their
complementary sequences on the opposite strand. Nucleotides and numbering correspond to the HIV-1 HXB2 sequence.

In summary, all of the seven predicted stem-loop structures in the HIV-1 5' UTR (Fig. 2) are known to be important for genome encapsidation, and all of these RNA
structural elements have also been assigned other functions in various steps of the viral life cycle, e.g. the role of
SL1 in the initiation of dimerization. The existence of such
overlapping functions for these RNA structures raises the
possibility that some of these functions, such as dimerization and packaging, might be linked. The evidence for and
against the existence of such a link in HIV-1 will be the
main focus of the remainder of this review.

Is dimerization a prerequisite for packaging?
One of the first electron microscopy studies of a retroviral
DLS in 1976 proposed that this region "could have some
role in packaging the RNA in the virus" [16]. This raised
the question of a possible link between dimerization and

packaging that is still debated. The answer to this question
has significance in our basic understanding of the retroviral life cycle and may also have implications for therapy,
since many groups are actively studying these two activities as potential drug targets.
Clues from in vitro studies
Early reports on in vitro dimerization of HIV-1 RNA
showed that the DLS localized to a stretch of genomic
RNA downstream of the 5' SD (nt 311–415) [23,88], and
it was noted that this dimerization domain encompassed
a previously identified packaging element that had also
been shown to bind NC [51-53]. This dependence of HIV1 RNA dimerization on cis elements required for packaging was immediately interpreted to mean that retroviral
RNA dimerization, activated by either NC or Gag precursors, should direct genomic RNA into the virion, implying

Page 5 of 14

Retrovirology 2004, 1:23

that dimerization might be a prerequisite for packaging.
Since HIV-1, MuLV, and RSV all contain elements
involved in dimerization that were also required for packaging [23,89,90], it was proposed that dimerization might
function as a molecular switch that negatively regulates
translation and positively regulates encapsidation [88].
The existence of a DLS downstream of the major splice
donor would seemingly supply a convenient mechanism
whereby only genome length RNA would be able to
dimerize and subsequently become encapsidated into the
virion. However, evidence questioning such a dimerization-mediated mechanism of genomic RNA packaging
came from studies showing that sequences upstream of
the SD site had even greater dimerization capabilities than
those located downstream [25-27]. The involvement of
such sequences (e.g. the DIS, SL1) in the dimerization
process questioned the link between dimerization and
packaging, because these sequences are also found in all
HIV-1 spliced viral RNAs.
Observations from in vivo studies
Early in vivo studies analyzing the structure of virion-associated RNA from rapid-harvest avian retroviruses showed
that viral RNA appeared to be a mixture of monomers and
dimers [91-93]. Similar results had also been reported
with PR [94,95] and NC [24,94,96,97] mutants, which
argued against the notion that dimerization is a prerequisite for packaging. However, analysis of rapid-harvest
virus in MuLV showed that genomic RNA was already in
the form of a dimer shortly after budding, albeit as a less
stable, physically different RNA dimer than that present in
mature virions [42]. Based on these observations it was
proposed that MuLV particles never package monomeric
RNAs, but rather that the dimeric RNA structure might be
integral to the packaging signal that is recognized by Gag
during assembly. It was also speculated that the previously reported presence of monomers in viral RNA preparations had resulted from the physical dissociation of
fragile unstable dimers during RNA preparation. Similar
experiments performed on PR- mutants of HIV-1 showed
that substantial amounts of monomeric RNA could be
detected [98]. Since PR- dimers were shown to be less stable than wild-type dimers, it was assumed that dimers
were preferentially packaged in PR- particles, but that
some fragile dimeric structures had dissociated during
RNA preparation. Based on these in vivo results with both
MuLV and HIV-1, it was concluded that dimerization is a
prerequisite for packaging and should be considered to be
a general feature of retrovirus assembly.

Further insights into this topic can be obtained by examination of results from a number of studies aimed at
understanding the role of the DIS in HIV-1 replication.
One such study, in which DIS loop palindrome sequences
were mutated, found that mutation of the palindrome to

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/1/1/23

shorter or longer versions of GC stretches did not have
major effects on viral RNA dimerization; however, partial
RNA packaging defects were observed that also corresponded to diminutions in viral replication [33]. Based
on these data, it was proposed that these DIS loop
mutants might have experienced a partial dimerization
defect that caused inefficient packaging [33]. In a similar
study, mutation of the palindrome, as well as deletion of
the upper stem-loop of SL1 caused drastic reductions in
viral infectivity and decreases in both dimerization and
packaging of HIV-1 genomic RNA [32]. In an attempt to
explain how these mutations could affect both activities, a
model was proposed in which Gag does not specifically
recognize the dimerized genome but rather initially interacts with one molecule of genomic RNA that happens to
be linked (dimerized) to a second such molecule. Then,
during packaging, Gag would effectively bind to two
genomic RNA molecules at once. Hence, defects in dimerization would result in subsequent packaging defects.
Based on these data, it was also concluded that the encapsidation and dimerization processes are coupled to some
extent.
Although several groups had attempted to delineate the
relationship between dimerization and packaging, the fact
remains that the RNA signals that are important for both
of these activities overlap in most retroviral genomes; this
makes it difficult to interpret the results of mutagenesis
studies. In an attempt to generate viruses that would be
expected to display selective defects in dimerization or
packaging, one group designed a panel of constructs containing mutations in SL1, SL3, or both [99]. Results from
this study showed that deletion of either SL1 alone, or SL3
plus adjacent flanking sequences, reduced genomic packaging, while deletion of SL1 and SL3 simultaneously
caused an even further reduction. With respect to
dimerization, complete deletion of SL1, or even disruption of the base-pairing in the upper stem, resulted in elevated levels of monomer-sized RNA species on native
Northern blots, again confirming the importance of this
region for the in vivo HIV-1 RNA dimerization process.
Yet, these mutant genomes could still be packaged, suggesting that HIV-1 RNAs need not be dimers for this to
happen. Thus, the authors concluded that dimerization is
not a prerequisite for packaging but rather serves an independent function in the retroviral life cycle. In the abovecited article, the effects of SL3 mutations on dimerization
were not studied, but our group later showed that viruses
containing even minor substitutions in or around SL3
could have significant effects on both dimerization and
packaging [100,101].
In summary, the in vivo studies described above commonly observed that mutations in 5' RNA sequences
affected both dimerization and packaging, presumably

Retrovirology 2004, 1:23

due to the close proximity of the RNA dimerization and
packaging signals.
Can monomers be packaged?
In an attempt to separate the dimerization and packaging
functions, and to characterize the DIS-DLS region without
altering packaging activity, one group generated mutant
constructs carrying a duplication of approximately 1000
nt from the HIV-1 5' region (termed E/DLS) including the
encapsidation signal and the DIS-DLS [102]. They found
that the presence of an ectopic E/DLS near the 3' region of
the genome resulted in the appearance of monomeric
RNA in virus particles, suggesting that monomers can be
packaged and that dimerization of HIV-1 genomic RNA is
not required for packaging. However, they also found that
two intact E/DLS regions had to be present on the same
RNA molecule in order for packaging of monomers to
occur. Therefore, it was assumed that these monomers
had been generated from an intramolecular interaction
between the two E/DLS regions. If we assume that such an
intramolecular interaction between two DLS structures
would occur on a single RNA molecule, however, might
such a structure then not also appear as a dimer to a Gag
protein that was attempting to package it? Although these
data were interpreted to mean that dimerization is not
required for packaging, they also suggest that some structure that is generated by the interaction of the two E/DLS
regions might be recognized by Gag in order to facilitate
packaging. In the context of wild-type genomic RNA containing only one E/DLS region, such a structure might
then only be generated by an intermolecular interaction
between two RNA molecules, i.e. a dimer. Hence, these
results also imply that dimerization might be required for
proper packaging.

In a follow-up study, the same group created mutant HIV1 particles that contained only monomeric RNAs, and
concluded that these mutants demonstrated the complete
separation of encapsidation from physical dimerization
of retroviral RNA [103]. However, they also reported that
these viruses packaged only monomers, and that packaging efficiencies were approximately half those of wildtype, implying that dimerization is the sole mechanism to
ensure the packaging of two copies of viral genomic RNA
into each virus particle. In addition, the packaged monomers might have originally been weak dimers that dissociated during extraction and analysis, as has been pointed
out in previous reports [42,102].
However, the above results do raise the issue of packaging
specificity in mutant viruses. We and others have shown
that, in COS cells, HIV-1 can incorporate significant
amounts of spliced viral RNA when proper packaging of
full-length viral genomic RNA is reduced [99,104]. During
assembly, Gag will always successfully package some

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/1/1/23

RNA, and it is important to know the degree of specificity
with which monomers versus dimers are packaged. If
monomer-packaging mutants concomitantly package
high levels of spliced viral RNA, then it is likely that packaging specificity may have been compromised by the
existence of an extra E/DLS, and that the packaging of the
monomers was non-specific. However, a lack of spliced
viral RNA in these virions would indicate that the monomers were packaged with a high degree of specificity, and
would have implications as to whether or not Gag initially
recognizes viral genomic RNA in a dimeric versus a monomeric state. None of the viruses engineered to package
only monomers were able to efficiently establish a new
round of infection, suggesting that dimerization is
required for replication if not for packaging. It is difficult
to predict what other effects the addition of large segments of highly structured RNA might have on the viral
life cycle.
Another group reported similar phenotypes in the context
of an HIV-1 mutant that was designed to have altered
Gag/Gag-Pol ratios [105]. Analysis of virion-derived
genomic RNA from these viruses showed an increase in
packaging of monomers, demonstrating that stable RNA
dimers are not required for encapsidation of HIV-1
genomic RNA. Interestingly, these viruses also showed
drastically reduced infectivity.
Insights from forced evolution studies
We have also been studying the HIV-1 5' UTR and its putative interactions with Gag, and how these interactions
affect dimerization and packaging activities. The DIS is
known to be important for viral replication
[32,33,63,99,106-109],
reverse
transcription
[47,48,107,109], RNA dimerization [32,99,106,109111], and packaging [32,33,74,99,107,108,110], as well
as packaging specificity [99]. However, despite the obvious importance of this stem-loop structure, work from
our group has shown that defective viral replication
caused by deletions in the DIS can be largely corrected by
a series of compensatory point mutations identified in
matrix, capsid, p2, and NC [112-114]. These findings
imply that the RNA sequences comprising the DIS interact
in some way with these domains of Gag, and that when
the RNA sequences are mutated, the virus will acquire
adaptive mutations that potentially restore putative RNAprotein interactions over long-term culture. Since the originally deleted RNA sequences were in the DIS, we had naturally assumed that the major defect of these mutants
would relate to RNA dimerization, and that compensatory
mutations had arisen to correct defective RNA dimerization activity. To our surprise, this was not the case.
Although our mutants did indeed yield reduced levels of
dimerized genomic RNA in virus particles, the compensatory mutations in Gag that restored replication capacity

Retrovirology 2004, 1:23

[112-114] did not correct dimerization defects [109].
Rather, compensatory mutations apparently resulted in
increased overall levels of viral genomic RNA that were
packaged into virus particles, irrespective of impaired
RNA dimerization. Similar effects on packaging were
observed in the context of compensatory mutations identified during long-term culture of viruses containing
mutations outside the DIS, such as the poly(A) hairpin
and the U5-PBS complex [87], and between the PBS and
SL1 [115]. These findings again question the link between
dimerization and packaging, since our compensatory
point mutations were able to increase RNA packaging levels without correcting dimerization. One possibility is
that the revertant viruses somehow gained the ability to
package wild-type levels of RNA without correcting dimerization defects, i.e. they packaged more monomers. However, we also cannot rule out the possibility that our point
mutations in Gag may have restored weak dimerization
properties to the mutated RNAs, and that the latter dimers
dissociated during extraction and analysis.
In a follow-up study, we created two other DIS deletions
and combined them with various combinations of the
previously identified compensatory point mutations. We
showed that these mutant viruses, ∆Loop (lacking the
loop region of SL1) and ∆DIS (lacking the complete SL1)
displayed defects in replication, RNA dimerization, and
packaging. Once more, all of these but dimerization were
largely corrected by the compensatory point mutations in
Gag [104]. Even a virus that lacked the DIS, e.g. ∆DIS, and
which never showed any signs of viral growth in tissue
culture, was able to replicate to significant extent when it
also possessed the compensatory mutations.
The mechanism(s) whereby these compensatory point
mutations functioned to restore replication had eluded us
for some time. Recently, however, we employed an RNase
protection assay to discriminate between genomic and
spliced viral RNA packaged into virus particles. Our results
showed that all of our 5' UTR mutant viruses aberrantly
packaged increased levels of spliced viral RNA compared
to wild-type virions. More importantly, however, the
effect of one of our compensatory point mutations (i.e.
MP2; a Thr->Ile substitution at position 12 of the SP1
spacer peptide in Gag) was to exclude spliced viral RNA
from being packaged into mutant virions [104]. Surprisingly, this single point mutation was also able to restore
significant levels of virus replication to our ∆DIS mutant
virus, which had been noninfectious in both T cell lines
and blood mononuclear cells.
Previous work had suggested that the packaging of spliced
viral RNA is a mechanism used by packaging mutants to
fill the space that would normally be occupied by
genomic RNA [99]. Were this the case, then the MP2-

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/1/1/23

mediated exclusion of spliced viral RNA from the virus
particle should have been accompanied by increased
packaging of genomic RNA. In the absence of MP2, the
mutant particles contained lower levels of genomic RNA
and higher levels of spliced viral RNA packaged than wildtype. In contrast, the presence of MP2 led to the exclusion
of spliced viral RNA, but had no effect on packaging of
genomic RNA. In the context of dimerization and packaging in the mutated viruses, it is possible that spliced viral
RNAs, which do contain some RNA elements involved in
RNA dimerization, including the DIS, might form heterodimers with molecules of genomic RNA. These putative heterodimers might be packageable, but it is unlikely
that virions containing such genomes would be able to
replicate, e.g. the noninfectious ∆DIS mutant. However,
in the presence of MP2, the modified Gag protein might
in some way block the formation of such an RNA heterodimer, thereby increasing the probability that dimers
form between two genomic RNA molecules, resulting in
partially restored levels of virus replication. Since these
genomic RNA molecules are already mutated in dimerization signals, these weaker dimers would probably appear
on a gel as monomers. In such a model, MP2 would act to
restore dimerization, resulting in increased replication
capacity, suggesting that dimerization is required for
proper packaging to ensure that a particle is infectious.
Unfortunately, this is virtually impossible to prove with
current in vitro and in vivo protocols. New approaches to
study dimerization and packaging within the cell will
hopefully allow new hypotheses to be tested.
The packaging of spliced viral RNA and/or the exclusion
of such RNA species raises the question of whether the
viral RNA sequence, or possibly the RNA structure, is
important in proper assembly and/or structural integrity
of the virus particle itself. Evidence in support of this possibility comes from studies on the binding of NC, in the
context of full-length Gag, to viral genomic RNA. This
might concentrate Gag proteins onto one or more RNA
molecules, thereby facilitating Gag-Gag multimerization
in a template-driven manner. Hence, viral genomic RNA
would be a structural element, or scaffold, on which the
virion can assemble [116]. Other reports have shown that
viral RNA can affect particle morphogenesis [116-119]
and structural stability [120,121], although the mechanisms involved are unclear. If RNA structure, or even the
dimeric versus monomeric state of the RNA, truly does
play a role in virion assembly and/or stability, this might
also explain the apparent detection of monomeric RNA in
the HIV-1 mutants mentioned above. For example, the
duplication of large E/DLS sequences would undoubtedly
have altered the overall structure of viral RNA, which
might have resulted in the formation of unstable virus
particles [102,103]. Degradation of such particles could
have indirectly caused the dissociation of dimers that

Page 8 of 14

Retrovirology 2004, 1:23

would then appear as monomers on a gel. The fact that
these viruses were all noninfectious may also have been
due to the formation of unstable virus particles.
Consistent with this concept, we found by electron microscopy that HIV-1 mutants lacking DIS stem sequences displayed an increased proportion of immature virus
particles [114]. This might mean that either the RNA structure, or the lack of a properly formed dimer, resulted in
the production of virus particles with abnormal morphology. Since RNA can affect Gag cleavage, it is possible that
mutations in the RNA might have also compromised the
cleavage of Gag precursor proteins, which may subsequently have affected particle maturation [122]. We
believe that proper RNA dimerization may be a prerequisite for efficient virion assembly and structural stability.
As stated, the link between dimerization and packaging is
a
subject
of
ongoing
debate
[32,33,42,98,99,102,103,109,110], but we and others
view dimerization as a prerequisite for packaging.
Genomic RNA can be packaged as monomers
[99,102,103,105,109], or alternatively as weak dimers
that appear as monomers on gels, but mutant viruses that
exhibit dimerization defects generally do not grow as well
as wild-type viruses. The fact that our ∆DIS-MP2 virus can
replicate in tissue culture, despite being severely compromised in genome dimerization, is evidence that efficient
dimerization is not required for packaging or replication.
In the absence of an authentic DIS, other sequences that
affect dimerization may form a weak dimer that allows
RNA to be recognized and adequately packaged
[87,100,101]. The contribution of the DIS might then be
to significantly increase the efficiency of the dimerization
process, resulting in more efficient packaging and replication. In conclusion, we agree with opinions expressed by
others that the generation of virus particles able to package monomeric genomes is possible, but that dimerization is likely to be a prerequisite for the production of
infectious viral progeny [10].

The DIS as a therapeutic target?
It is clear that virus replication capacity is significantly
affected whenever dimerization and/or packaging are
compromised, suggesting that these activities can be
exploited as anti-HIV drug targets. Indeed, the DIS was
first proposed to be a potential therapeutic target at least
10 years ago, and antisense molecules were directed at this
region of viral RNA [26,123], without practical outcome.
Other approaches directly target the HIV-1 kissing-loop
complex, which resembles the eubacterial 16S ribosomal
aminoacyl-tRNA site, i.e. the target of aminoglycoside
antibiotics such as paramycin and neomycin [124], both
of which specifically bind to the kissing-loop complex.
Drugs based on antibiotics with high affinity and specificity for the DIS may be a worthwhile approach, although

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/1/1/23

efficacy might be compromised by the fact that HIV can
replicate in the face of mutations that decrease genomic
dimerization by more than 50% [104].
RNA interference (RNAi) is a novel mechanism that regulates gene expression in which small interfering RNAs
direct the targeted degradation of RNA in a sequence-specific manner (reviewed in Lee and Rossi [125]). Although
RNAi is a powerful tool, it is not yet clear whether its therapeutic potential will materialize. This not-withstanding,
several reports show that specific degradation of HIV-1
RNA is possible in infected cells [125], and reductions of
p24 levels by as much as 4 logs have been achieved using
RNAi directed against HIV-1 tat and rev [126]. DNA vectors are currently being engineered that will allow for
long-term production of siRNAs for use against chronic
diseases, such as HIV-1.
The DIS might also be a good candidate for sequence-specific targeting of HIV by RNAi therapy since it is highly
conserved among naturally occurring virus isolates, and,
due to its position upstream of the major splice donor, is
contained in all HIV-1 RNA transcripts, both spliced and
unspliced. Effective DIS-directed degradation of HIV RNA
should confer the same viral phenotype as observed with
our ∆DIS mutant, which never showed signs of virus replication in either permissive T cell lines or blood mononuclear cells [104]. One concern with use of RNAi is how
accessible certain RNA sequences might be. For example,
complex secondary structures might cause some
sequences to be buried and therefore inaccessible to the
siRNA. However, this would not be a concern with DISdirected RNAi, since the DIS contains a 6 nt palindromic
sequence that is believed to initiate the dimerization
process by binding to an identical sequence on another
molecule of genomic RNA. If two 6 nt stretches of RNA
can find each other on two 9200 nt strands of highly structured RNA, they should also be accessible to siRNAs.
Recently, the practicality of RNAi-based therapies against
HIV-1 was called into question when it was shown that
HIV-1 was able to escape the antiviral pressure of RNAi by
generating substitutions or even deletions within RNAi
target sequences [127,128]. This again highlights the versatility and plasticity of the HIV-1 genome. However, in
these studies, the RNAi target sequences were located
within the tat and nef genes, and the mutations that were
generated blocked the effects of the RNAi without conferring any major detriment to virus replication. In contrast,
RNAi may be more useful if targeted to more critical RNA
elements within the genome, such as the DIS or the Ψ
region, since any escape mutations that occur might result
in viruses with severely impaired replication ability.

All of these DIS-directed strategies rely on specifically targeting the viral RNA itself, which might not be practical
given our inadequate knowledge of the overall structure of
the HIV-1 5' region. The fact that RNA sequences such as
SL1 and SL3 are known to form relevant RNA-protein
interactions raises the possibility that the protein component of these interactions might also provide potential targets for anti-HIV therapy. Such approaches are currently
being explored in research aimed at designing inhibitors
of the TAR-Tat RNA-protein interaction [129]. Similar
approaches might also be developed to target RNA-protein interactions involving SL1 or SL3 and Gag.

Future directions
Current HIV combination therapies have demonstrated
that a multi-targeted approach against the virus results in
the greatest degree of suppression of virus replication.
Therefore, the identification of novel targets for anti-HIV
therapy could significantly improve HIV treatment strategies. HIV-1 RNA dimerization is clearly a critical event that
could be exploited as a target once its complete mechanism is elucidated. It is pleasing to see that a number of
laboratories that have actively researched RNA dimerization and packaging are now moving beyond conventional
in vitro and in vivo approaches toward more biologically
relevant methods. One group has taken chemical modification protocols commonly used for in vitro RNA analysis,
and adapted them for use in virus-producing cells. Hence,
structural analysis of viral RNA, that would previously be
carried out only in vitro on short fragments of artificially
transcribed RNA, can now be performed on in vivo-generated HIV-1 genomic RNA (J.-C. Paillart and R. Marquet,
personal communication, and [130]). This method also
allows comparisons of cellular and virion-derived HIV-1
RNA and represents a middle ground between classic in
vitro and in vivo approaches. The goal of this work is to
provide insight on the true structure of the HIV-1 leader,
and on which RNA substructures are involved in dimerization. Preliminary data suggest that viral RNA may
already be dimerized in the cytoplasm (J-C. Paillart and R.
Marquet, unpublished data). This method might also
have application in regard to in vivo foot-printing that
could allow the study of RNA-protein interactions in the
context of virus-producing cells.
The structure of the viral RNA that exists in the cell has
long been a topic of interest, and recent data suggest that
different RNA sequences might be involved in higher
order intrastrand structures that favor the dimerization of
the two RNA molecules. Such a model has been proposed
[131], and is supported by numerous in vitro dimerization
studies conducted on HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV RNA
[41,131-133]. The model proposes that the HIV-1 5' UTR
can form two alternating conformations, termed the longdistance interaction (LDI) and the branched multiple

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/1/1/23

hairpin (BMH) structures. The LDI conformation is
believed to exist when the RNA is in a monomer form,
and is thought to form a long extended base-paired structure with almost all of the proposed stem-loop sequences
buried. This structure is thought to be favored during certain steps of the life cycle, such as translation. In this
model, NC has been shown to bind the LDI structure to
induce a switch to the BMH structure [131], in which the
DIS and ψ would then be exposed in a manner able to
mediate dimerization and packaging. Such a 'riboswitch'
is an attractive hypothesis, especially since similar mechanisms have recently been proposed to account for previously unexplained results in the field of gene regulation
[134]. Although there is currently little in vivo evidence
directly supporting such a model in the case of retroviruses, the results of previous mutagenesis studies from
several laboratories correlate with those that would be
predicted from the riboswitch model, both concerning
RNA packaging and RNA dimerization status [135]. In
regard to dimerization being a prerequisite for packaging,
it would also be interesting to test whether an HIV-1 RNA
molecule in the LDI conformation can be packaged. Since
the BMH conformation is believed to mediate dimerization, one would assume that the LDI structures would not
be packageable if dimerization is truly a packaging
prerequisite.
Others have developed a fluorescence resonance energy
transfer (FRET)-based system to allow visualization of
RNA-Gag interactions within cells (A.M. Lever and coworkers, unpublished data). Such a system might provide
insight into the timing of genome selection and packaging. It will also be interesting to determine whether this
system can be adapted to pinpoint how retroviral RNA
dimerization takes place within cells, and whether
dimerization indeed occurs before RNA is selected for
packaging.
