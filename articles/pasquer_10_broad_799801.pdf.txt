Broad spectrum microarray for fingerprint-based
bacterial species identification
Frédérique Pasquer1, Cosima Pelludat2, Brion Duffy2, Jürg E Frey1*

Abstract
Background: Microarrays are powerful tools for DNA-based molecular diagnostics and identification of pathogens.
Most target a limited range of organisms and are based on only one or a very few genes for specific identification.
Such microarrays are limited to organisms for which specific probes are available, and often have difficulty
discriminating closely related taxa. We have developed an alternative broad-spectrum microarray that employs
hybridisation fingerprints generated by high-density anonymous markers distributed over the entire genome for
identification based on comparison to a reference database.
Results: A high-density microarray carrying 95,000 unique 13-mer probes was designed. Optimized methods were
developed to deliver reproducible hybridisation patterns that enabled confident discrimination of bacteria at the
species, subspecies, and strain levels. High correlation coefficients were achieved between replicates. A subselection of 12,071 probes, determined by ANOVA and class prediction analysis, enabled the discrimination of all
samples in our panel. Mismatch probe hybridisation was observed but was found to have no effect on the
discriminatory capacity of our system.
Conclusions: These results indicate the potential of our genome chip for reliable identification of a wide range of
bacterial taxa at the subspecies level without laborious prior sequencing and probe design. With its high resolution
capacity, our proof-of-principle chip demonstrates great potential as a tool for molecular diagnostics of broad
taxonomic groups.

Background
Microarray platforms for practical diagnostics have been
developed for identification of human/animal- and
plant-pathogenic species. These have been primarily
designed as taxa-specific chips, and have required extensive knowledge of sufficiently discriminatory genes such
as the cytochrome oxidase 1 (CO1) or the cytochrome b
genes for insects and mammals [1], 16 S rDNA, rpoB,
groEL or gyrB for bacteria [2-4], or coat-protein genes
for viruses [5]. Probe selection with adequate specificity
to identify organisms at the genus, species, and less frequently subspecies (e.g., serotypes, pathovars) entails
labour- and time-intensive sequencing. Substantial effort
and resources must be invested to compensate for
inherent intra-group genetic variation of diagnostic
DNA fragments, demanding sequencing of a representative number of individual organisms or isolates in order

to detect all potential variations [6]. Diagnostics in clinical, animal or plant health demand exclusion of a
broad-spectrum of unknown but related taxa that are
inconsequential for therapeutic or regulatory purposes,
while rapidly and sensitively detecting select-agent and/
or pathogenic organisms. Achieving identification at a
high level of taxonomic resolution such as strains and/
or pathovars typically requires incorporation of multiple
target regions, each of which requires individual design
and validation steps [4].
Inadequacy of available sequence information for
many taxa of interest poses a fundamental problem in
probe selection during diagnostic microarray design. A
panel of candidate probes must be evaluated by trialand-error since most do not hybridise as anticipated.
Even though many probes hybridise to correct target
sequences, often hybridisation is weak or produces
stronger signals for mismatch targets [7,8]. In gene
expression studies using chips carrying oligonucleotide
probes that target thousands of genes, this aspecificity

phenomenon is usually masked by the massive data output, and thus it has only recently received attention
[9-11]. This problem was identified earlier with diagnostic chip analysis since these carry far fewer probes than
transcriptomic microarrays. False hybridisations on diagnostic chips result in a lack of specificity and incorrect
identifications. Hybridisation performance of probes
cannot be predicted accurately, therefore, multiple (i.e.,
three to five) as opposed to single candidate probes
must be designed for each target, each requiring evaluation of specificity ‘on-chip’, in order to validate performance reliability.
With few exceptions, diagnostic microarrays have thus
far been developed for identification of organisms within
narrow taxonomic groups (i.e., within a family or genus)
or are limited to a few organisms that can be expected
to occur on a single host. Our objective in this study
was to develop a broad spectrum chip that would facilitate identification of bacteria regardless of taxa and
without requiring a priori knowledge of sequence targets, based solely on complete genome hybridisation
patterns. The high-density chip we designed incorporates short oligonucleotide probes of random sequence,
and requires neither a priori sequence information nor
species-specific probe design or and validation. A database comprised of hybridisation type-patterns for reference target organisms is required, as has been
established for other ‘gold-standard’ diagnostic technologies, but no sequencing is needed throughout the entire
process. Species identification will then be assessed
based upon match of their hybridisation pattern with
this pre-established taxon-specific database. Thus, this
strategy does not allow unambiguous identification of
taxa not present in the database. Our chip carries
95,000 unique 13-mer probes assembled on-chip by
NimbleGen® System Inc. This large number of small oligomers theoretically enables hybridisation of circa
10,000 probes per bacterial genome having a few Mb
genome size. Performance and reliability of this chip
applied for discrimination of bacteria at the species and
strain level is presented.

Results
We set out to develop a genome chip for discrimination
of bacteria without prior knowledge of gene targets or
specific probe design. Our aim was to obtain reproducible hybridisation patterns specific at the deepest possible
taxonomic level (i.e., genus, species, and subspecies).
Hybridisations were performed at low temperature (4°
C) which enhanced reproducible probe capture of specific targets, similar to a previous report with a short-oligonucleotide diagnostic microarray for differentiation of
Xanthomonas citri pathovars [12]. Although the low
hybridisation temperature might increase the number of

false positive hybridisation (i.e., to probes with an
imperfect match), our results were highly reproducible
as demonstrated by high correlation coefficients between
replicates (Figure 1). These values range from 0.95 up to
0.99 between strain replicates (average correlation values
of 0.97 +/- 0.002 standard error) and were generally
lower between different strains/species (down to 0.86
between M. luteus and Salmonella Typhimurium LT2
or Escherichia coli strain B samples). This demonstrated
that species and even strain dependent hybridisation
patterns were obtainable. In fact, there were more hybridised probes observed than expected based on the
assumption that hybridisation would occur only on perfect-match probes with small genome organisms such as
bacteria. This indicates that hybridisation also occurred
with probes containing mismatches.
Hybridisation behaviour of perfect-match probes

To assess the hybridisation behaviour of perfect match
probes, we studied the E. coli K12, and Salmonella LT2
strains whose genomes have been sequenced [13,14]. E.
coli K12 DNA (4.5 Mb genome plus a 5-kb plasmid)
showed a perfect match to 10,815 probes in BLAST analysis, and Salmonella LT2 (4.8 Mb genome) to 9,849
probes. This corresponds to the expected coverage
toward bacterial genomes of oligomers with random
probe sequence. Closer study on the hybridisation behaviour of these genome-specific probe sets showed a
broad range from no or low-level hybridisation to saturated hybridisation levels (65,535) for either the E. coli
K12 samples or the Salmonella LT2 samples. Since
most of these probes had only one perfect match on
their respective genome, there was no bias induced by
the frequency of the sequence in the genome on the
hybridisation level. Unexpectedly, a large number of
probes not belonging to the perfect match sets were
showing high hybridisation signals. Thus, while some
targets do not hybridise at all to perfect match probes,
others hybridise to mismatch probes. In fact we found
that irrespective of the applied background noise level,
only 12-17% of all hybridised probes were perfect match
probes and the remaining were mismatch probes. For
example, using the 10,000 lowest hybridisation intensity
probes that do not occur in the E. coli K12 genome as
background level, we found 8,567 E. coli K12 perfect
match probes with a positive hybridisation signal. The
total number of positive hybridisation signals was 70,667
probes, indicating a large fraction of mismatch hybridisation. However, our results provide strong evidence
that mismatch hybridisation was as reproducible as full
match hybridisation. For our strategy, mismatch hybridisation therefore delivers the same information content
as perfect match hybridisation, and contributes to the
discrimination power of the assay.

(top right) and difference between mean of replicate pair-wise correlations of one isolate to mean of non replicate pair-wise correlations of
other isolate, both reciprocal values are indicated below each other (down left). Reproducibility is demonstrated through the observed
correlation values which are higher between the replicates than with samples from other species for most of the cases. Values from the same
genera are highlighted in light grey and replicates from the same strains with a darker grey. Correlation can be higher between samples from
different strain or species (indicated in italics) than between replicates, revealing the need of sorting out aspecific probes. P. aggl stands for P.
agglomerans, P.vag for P. vagans, P. stew for P. stewartii subsp. indologenes, S. Typh for Salmonella Typhimurium, X.arbju for X. arboricola pv.
juglandis, X.arbpr for X. arboricola pv. pruni, X.camca for X. campestris pv. campestris and X.tratr for X. translucens pv. translucens. Replicates are
indicated from a to d.

Similar hybridisation results were obtained using the
E. coli K12 perfect-match probe set with E. coli B, E.
coli K12, P. agglomerans, P. vagans and P. stewartii
strains, and X. arboricola pathovars, as reflected by high
correlation values (Additional file 1) and low class prediction percentage of 73.3% (Table 1). No discrimination
was possible apart from the Salmonella DT204 and LT2,
X. campestris and translucens and M. luteus replicates.
Stronger hybridisation signals were even obtained with
this probe set for strains different from E. coli K12,
including the Gram-positive strain M. luteus. Similar
hybridisation results and low class prediction (CP) percentage (76.6%) were obtained with the Salmonella LT2
probe set (Table 1).
Hybridisation behaviour of the complete probe set

With the complete probe set, correlation values between
samples from the same species (e.g., X. arboricola
pathovars) or from the same genera (P. stewartii subsp.
indologenes and P. agglomerans strains) were sometimes
higher than between strain replicates (Figure 1). This

was reflected by the low CP percentage of 76.6% (Table
1). Due to the large number of probes, it was expected
that many probes would hybridise across related species
which likely explained the high similarity of patterns
between close relatives. Therefore, species-specific hybridisation patterns should be defined without these aspecific probes.
Evaluation of different discriminatory probe sets

Taxon-specific hybridisation patterns (i.e., type-patterns),
were established by entering prior information on group
affiliation of the replicate hybridisation experiments into
the data analysis software. Based on this prior information, we identified discriminatory probes showing similar
hybridisation signals between slide replicates but differences between the thirteen species/strains/variants by
means of ANOVA performed in GeneSpring GX v7.3.1.
Decreasing P-values between 0.05 and 0.000005 were
tested for the ANOVA using the Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate as a multiple testing correction
procedure to obtain different probe sets. The use of this

correction parameter increases the confidence that the
obtained probe sets were selected due to high reproducibility of hybridisation results. Best discriminatory
probe lists were then determined by cross-validation (Knearest neighbour method with Fischer’s exact test) with
the class prediction analysis tool of GeneSpring GX
v7.3.1. The percentage of correct prediction for the different probe selections ranges from 83.3-100% (Table 1).
The probe sets obtained were finally used for grouping
by cluster analysis based on Spearman’s rank correlation
with average linkage and confidence levels determined
by boot-strapping. Using the first probe set (P-value of
0.05 corresponding to 69,811 selected probes providing
96.6% of correct class prediction, Table 1), the cluster
obtained roughly corresponded to the expected hierarchical phylogeny. All Enterobacteriacea formed a large
cluster from which the replicates of Microccocacea M.
luteus and Xanthomonas pathovars were excluded. The
two E. coli strains clustered together, as did the Pantoea
species. However, one P. stewartii subsp. indologenes
grouped together with the P. vagans C9-1 samples
within the Pantoea sub-cluster instead of its respective
strain sub-cluster and X. arboricola pv. pruni samples
were not discriminated from the X. arboricola pv.
juglandis ones (data not shown). The Salmonella strains
DT204 and LT2 did not cluster together (although replicates within a strain did) but they clustered within the
Escherichia group or to the Pantoea group, respectively.
Similar results were obtained with P-values of 0.01 and
0.005 (96.6% CP, Table 1), but with the two Salmonella
strains linked as independent sub-clusters to the Pantoea group. Correct clustering of each strain was
obtained with a P-value of 0.001 (21,265 probes) but
prediction reached only 96.6%; only the P. agglomerans
strains and variants were not sub-clustering in the

expected phylogenetic manner. Decreasing the P-value
to 0.0003 (12,071 probes) resulted in 100% correct CP
(Table 1), correct group allocation as shown in Figure 2
and high correlation coefficients between replicates (Figure 3). Similar CP results were obtained with P-values
of 0.0001, 0.00005 and 0.00001 which all had prediction
results of 100% (Table 1); only the two latter did not
show the same clustering performance as the others as
X. arboricola pv. juglandis could not be distinguished
from X. translucens pv. translucens (data not shown).
The sets obtained with P-values of 0.0003 and 0.0001
correspond to the optimal range for species, strain and
variant discrimination for our strain panel as both correct class predictions and cluster representations were
obtained. Lower performance for discriminating the
Xanthomonas species were observed when decreasing
the significance level to P-value of 0.000005 corresponding to 507 probes (Table 1). Hybridisation patterns of
the Pantoea strains and Xanthomonas pathovars were
highly similar to each other indicating the limitations of
the chip at its current state of development and under
the given conditions.
Finally, it is important to note that when ANOVA was
performed based on random group allocation of taxa,
no probe list could be determined that would discriminate these groups. This confirms that, despite the huge
number of probes, the observed taxon-specific patterns
were obtained because they reflected the underlying
genomic sequences rather than just statistical noise.

Discussion
We have developed a high-density genome chip and
experimental conditions for identification of bacterial
pathogens at the species and subspecies level, based on
genomic hybridisation patterns. The main advantages of

our strategy using a genome chip are that i) no a priori
knowledge of the genome is required, ii) the genetic
markers cover the entire genome, and iii) due to the
large number of probes, the hybridisation patterns and
hence the derived taxon identifications are very robust.
This strategy could potentially be applied to a broad
range of bacterial strains of health or economic interest,
and extended to many living organisms. Our approach
is a modification of a strategy originally developed in

our laboratory since 1999 using many anonymous markers to fingerprint genomes [15]. The basic concept of
generating many anonymous markers from a genome to
produce a specific pattern was conceived in the early
1990 s and realized in the form of RAPD-PCR for species identification [16] and marker search [17,18]. Agarose gels were used to detect RAPD-PCR amplicons but
this technique suffers from lack of reproducibility. With
the advent of microarrays it became obvious that

Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients (top right) and difference between mean of replicate pair-wise correlations of one strain to mean of
non replicate pair-wise correlations of another strain, both reciprocal values are indicated below each other (down left). Values from the same
genera are highlighted in light grey and replicates from the same strains with a darker grey. Correlation coefficients between pair-wise replicates
are higher than the ones between strains, species or genera. P. aggl represents P. agglomerans, P.vag for P. vagans, P. stew for P. stewartii subsp.

campestris pv. campestris and X.tratr for X. translucens pv. translucens. Replicates are indicated from a to d.

attempts should be made to exploit these new tools for
fingerprint-based taxon characterisation. Eventually, a
strategy similar to the one developed at our laboratory
with a microarray containing 14,283 anonymous probes
was successfully applied to identify bacterial and other
genomes [19]. Together with the data shown here this
supports our conclusion that fingerprint-based species
identification is a powerful tool.
Observed hybridisation patterns were robust and
highly reproducible, and they enabled differentiation at
the deepest taxonomic level used in our experiments.
For example, we achieved discrimination of strains
within the same serovar (Salmonella), of different pathovars within the same species (X. arboricola pv. juglandis
and pv. pruni) and at the subspecies level with a strainvariant cured of a single plasmid (P. agglomerans).
Grouping of the different species was a close match to
phylogenetic expectations. The problematic/non-phylogenetic positioning of Salmonella enterica Typhimurium
strains using our chip may be explained by the genetic
diversity observed within this serovar [20], which has
recently been considered for differentiating Salmonella

serovars into genovars [21]. However, phylogenetically
“incorrect” clustering of strains did not interfere with
taxon identification enabled by the determined probe
sets with their high class prediction rates (Table 1).
Hybridisation patterns we obtained were not sequence
specific sensu stricto (e.g., E. coli K12 DNA did not match
exclusively to K12-specific probes). However, the hybridisation patterns were highly reproducible among replicates within the same strain. The off-target hybridisation
phenomenon has been recently taken into account with
oligonucleotide microarrays used for gene expression studies and can lead to incorrect interpretations of biological issues [10]. It is critical for diagnostic chips based on
sequence-specific probes to eliminate such non-specific
hybridisation. However, in our study, we took advantage
of mismatch hybridisations by considering these probes
as informative as perfect-match probes provided the
results were reproducible between replicate samples.

Conclusions
This work provides a foundation for building a fingerprint database containing important bacterial species

Pasquer et al. BMC Biotechnology 2010, 10:13

that can be hybridised on this broad spectrum chip.
Probes that do not give reliable results may eventually
be discarded to streamline the chip design. However,
sufficient probes have to be retained to ensure sufficient
fingerprint polymorphism for other bacterial species to
be identified, such as more Gram-positives which were
only represented by M. luteus in our panel. This should
eventually enable selection of a reduced probe set capable of comprehensive species and strain identification.
In terms of strain fingerprinting and microbial source
tracking, this genome chip offers a potential alternative
to current technology based on RFLP, microsatellite or
MLST approaches [22]. Starting with low amounts of
genomic DNA followed by whole genome amplification
could overcome problems of cultivation and facilitate
the identification process, mostly when starting from
unknown material.

Methods
Species, strains and pathovars used

Four Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae species and one
Gram-positive Micrococcaceae species were used to
determine the reliability of our genome chip approach
for taxon identification at the supra-species level. We
selected the two Escherichia coli strains (K12 and B)
because the K12 strain has been fully sequenced and is
known to differ from the B strain by presence or
absence of specific genomic regions. Two S. enterica
Typhimurium strains (LT2 with available genome
sequence, and DT204) were used. Salmonella strains are
known for frequent lateral gene transfer [14,23] and
complex genome variations [24,25], and are ideal targets
for examining the serotype concept with microarray
hybridisation profiling studies. Therefore, the concept of
genovars is increasingly used to identify genotypes
within serovar groups [21]. The Pantoea genera contain
species of clinical, plant pathogenic and beneficial plantprotection nature. The type strain P. agglomerans ATCC
27155 was isolated from a knee laceration and P. vagans
C9-1 is commercialized for biological control of plant
diseases, such as fire blight caused by Erwinia amylovora. A variant of C9-1 lacking the 530 kb plasmid
pPag3 (C9-1w) which carries pigmentation genes was
isolated in our laboratory, and selected for determination at the sub-strain level on our chip. The related
Pantoea stewartii subsp. indologenes strain DC283 is a
plant pathogen of maize [26]. Micrococcus luteus was
included as a representative of a Gram-positive bacterium with a high G-C content (65-75%), and because it is
phylogenetically distant from the Enterobacteriacea
used. Plant pathogen bacteria from the Xanthomonadaceae family (Xanthomonas arboricola pv juglandis CFBP
7179, X. arboricola pv pruni CFBP 5530, X. translucens
pv translucens CFBP 2054 and X. campestris pv

Page 7 of 9

campestris CFBP 5241) were included to test the determination of our chip at the pathovar level [27,28].
Strains used in the study originated from the French
Collection of Phytopathogenic Bacteria (collection française de bactéries phytopathogènes, CFBP strains), the
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC strain), University of Wisconsin-Madison (E. coli K12) the Robert
Koch Institut, Wernigerode, Germany, Institute of Public Health, Research Laboratory for Infectious Disease
(Salmonella Typhimurium LT2 and DT204), Oregon
State University, V.O. Stockwell, (P. stewartii subsp.
indologenes DC283, P. vagans C9-1 (P. vagans C9-1w in
house)), and were taxonomically verified in our laboratory. Strain C9-1 previously P. agglomerans has been
recently assigned to P. vagans [29-31].
DNA extraction and labelling

Genomic bacterial DNA was extracted following the
standard protocol described in Maniatis and Sambrook
[32] (strains K12, ATCC27155T, C9-1, C9-1w, DC283,
LT2, DT204, CFBP 7179, CFBP 5530, CFBP 2054 and
CFBP 5241), or was commercially obtained (E. coli
strain B and M. luteus, Sigma-Aldrich, Buchs, Switzerland). DNA was sonicated in a Bioruptor (Diagenode,
Liege, Belgium) to obtain fragments of approximately
500 bp. Sonicated DNA (10 μg) together with 5 μl random hexamer 1 mM (Fermentas, Lab Force, Nunningen,
Switzerland) were denatured 5 min at 95°C and cooled.
Labelling reactions were performed by incubation overnight at 37°C in 50 μl with 40 U of Klenow fragment
(Fermentas), 5 μl of 10 × buffer, 1 μl of Cyanine-3
labelled dUTP (Perkin Elmer, Schwerzenbach, Switzerland), 0.5 mM of dNTP (without dTTP) (Fermentas).
Samples were purified using PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Basel, Switzerland). Quality and concentration was
determined using a ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop®, Witec AG, Littau, Switzerland).
Nimblechip™ arrays

Several visual basic macros were written to design 13-bp
long probes. Probes were generated by random selection
among one of the four bases (i.e., A, C, T, G), adding
the newly selected base to the growing oligonucleotide
up to a length of 13 bases. Each new probe was added
to a probe set after being checked for identity against all
previously designed probes. All probes that were either
identical or complementary to previously stored probes
were discarded. Probes showing hairpin structures of
more than 3-bp length were also discarded. Finally, the
probes were selected for a minimal weighted difference
approximately equivalent to one centrally located base
pair by allocating difference scores based on the mismatch position. Positions 1 or 13 were given a score of
0.1, position 2 or 12 one of 0.2, 3 or 11 one of 0.3, 4 or

10 one of 0.5, 5 or 9 one of 0.7 and the remaining mismatches at positions 6, 7 and 8 obtained a score of 1.0.
The mismatch scores were summed and all probes with
a total score below 1.0 compared to the previously
stored probes were discarded. With increasing numbers
of probes this procedure progressively slows down the
probe design process and therefore, the maximum number of probes per run was set to 37,000 and the macro
was run three times independently to generate three
sets of probes. Only 118 probes were found to be identical and/or complementary among these three probe sets
indicating that probe generation was indeed random.
These 118 redundant probes were discarded and the
remaining 110,882 probes were merged into a single file.
These probes were then checked for shifted homology, i.
e., for probes that were identical if shifted by one to
three base pairs. This procedure eliminated another
15,601 probes resulting in 95,281 unique probes of
which the last 281 were discarded to form the final set
of 95,000 probes.
Our custom chip contained four replicates of 95,000
probes synthesized on silanized glass slides [33,34]. The
probes had two specific parts: a poly-dT 12-mer tail,
linked to the chip surface by an amino-linker, and a 13mer part of random sequence. Sets of 10,895 and 9,849
perfect-match probes were found to correspond to the
E. coli K12 and S. enterica Typhimurium LT2 genome
sequences, respectively, by blasting the entire probe set
against their genome and plasmid sequences.

Data analysis

Slides were scanned at a gain of 500-600 at 532 nm
wavelength and 5-μm resolution with a Genepix 4100A
scanner (Axon Instrument, Sunnyvale, California, United
States of America). Quantification of hybridisation signal
was performed with NimbleScan™ software (NimbleGen®
System, Inc.). Signals of each slide were smoothed using
the NMPP program [35]. Normalisation per chip to
50th percentile and further analyses were performed in
GeneSpring GX v7.3.1 (Agilent Technologies, Basel,
Switzerland). One-way ANOVA was performed with different P-values to determine groups of probes with the
same hybridisation pattern between replicates and giving
the best discrimination of the species and subspecies.
Class prediction analysis was used with the K-nearest
neighbour method and Fisher’s exact test to control the
quality of ANOVA probe selections for identification of
taxa. Reproducibility of the hybridisation results was
tested at several technical levels: DNA extraction, sonication of DNA and labelling did not reveal any bias.
The data discussed in this publication have been deposited in NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus [36] and are

Hybridisation

Prior to hybridisation, 3 μg of Cy3-labelled DNA in 100
μl of 2 × hybridisation buffer (NimbleGen® System, Inc.,
Madison, WI, USA) and 40 μl Hybridisation Component
A (NimbleGen® System, Inc.), 0.3 μl of 3’ labelled Cy3CPK6 50 nM (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville,
IA, USA) and ddH2O up to 200 μl were denatured for 5
min at 95°C then cooled. Hybridisation was performed
over 16 hrs at 4°C with a pump rate of 1ml/min for preventing the risks of precipitation in an aHyb™ hybridisation station (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch-Gladbach,
Germany). Washings were performed at 20°C in the station with NimbleGen® Buffers I to III for 1 min each.
Slides were incubated in the last washing buffer for 1
min before blow-drying with high-pressure air. Hybridisations were performed for four samples of E. coli K12,
two E. coli B, two S. enterica Typhimurium LT2, three
S. enterica Typhimurium DT204, three P. stewartii
subsp. indolognes DC283, two P. vagans C9-1, two P.
vagans C9-1w, two P. agglomerans ATCC27155T, two
M. luteus, two X. arboricola pv. pruni, two X. arboricola
pv. juglandis, two X. campestris pv. campestris and two
X. translucens pv. translucens.
