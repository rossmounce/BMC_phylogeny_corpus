Abstract
Background: The Drosophila gene embryonic lethal abnormal visual system (elav) is the prototype
of a gene family present in all metazoans. Its members encode structurally conserved neuronal
proteins with three RNA Recognition Motifs (RRM) but they paradoxically act at diverse levels of
post-transcriptional regulation. In an attempt to understand the history of this family, we searched
for orthologs in eleven completely sequenced genomes, including those of humans, D. melanogaster
and C. elegans, for which cDNAs are available.
Results: We analyzed 23 orthologs/paralogs of elav, and found evidence of gain/loss of gene copy
number. For one set of genes, including elav itself, the coding sequences are free of introns and their
products most resemble ELAV. The remaining genes show remarkable conservation of their exon
organization, and their products most resemble FNE and RBP9, proteins encoded by the two elav
paralogs of Drosophila. Remarkably, three of the conserved exon junctions are both close to
structural elements, involved respectively in protein-RNA interactions and in the regulation of subcellular localization, and in the vicinity of diverse sequence variations.
Conclusion: The data indicate that the essential elav gene of Drosophila is newly emerged,
restricted to dipterans and of retrotransposed origin. We propose that the conserved exon
junctions constitute potential sites for sequence/function modifications, and that RRM binding
proteins, whose function relies upon plastic RNA-protein interactions, may have played an
important role in brain evolution.

Background
The elav (embryonic lethal abnormal visual system) gene of D.
melanogaster was the the first identified member of a family of neuronal RNA binding proteins that is conserved in
metazoans [1,2]. The proteins in this family contain three
RNA Recognition Motifs (RRM), with a hinge region separating the second and third RRMs and an optional nonconserved N-terminal region. The hinge includes signals
essential for nuclear export and subcellular localization
[3].

RRM are common protein domains found in all life kingdoms. In humans, there are 497 genes encoding RRM containing proteins, which represent 2% of the human gene
products. Proteins containing one or several of these
domains are capable of interacting in a sequence specific
manner with single stranded RNA molecules and of
directing the assembly of multiprotein complexes [4,5]. In
spite of the remarkable sequence conservation of the RRM
domains, RRM-containing proteins perform numerous
functions, intervening at all the possible steps of RNA

metabolism. The RRM domain is composed of about 90
amino acids and contains a conserved octapeptide termed
RNP-1 (ribonucleoprotein motif) and a conserved hexapeptide termed RNP-2. Structural studies indicate that
four antiparallel beta-sheets form the RNA interaction surface, with RNP-1 and RNP-2 on the two inner sheets (beta
1 and beta 3). In RNA-RRM complexes, nucleotides establish contacts with residues in the RNPs, with regions in the
RRM beyond the RNP domains also involved in RNA recognition. The plasticity of RRMs in their sequence-specific
recognition of topologically diverse RNA is likely to be
correlated with their presence in a variety of proteins
involved in the diverse steps of post-transcriptional regulation.
There are three elav-related genes in D. melanogaster. The
elav gene encodes a nuclear product present in all neurons
throughout development and is required for the differentiation of postmitotic neurons and their maintenance [1].
The rbp9 (RNA binding protein 9) product is present in neuronal nuclei starting at the third larval instar and also in
the cytoplasm of cystocytes during oogenesis. Although
neuronal expression is predominant, rbp9 mutations
reveal a role in cystocyte proliferation and differentiation,
but no neuronal defects have been reported [6,7]. The
expression of fne (found in neurons) resembles elav's, but
with a slightly delayed onset. FNE is cytoplasmic, but the
elav and fne genes interact, suggesting protein shuttling
[8,9]. The products of elav family members are essentially
present in the nervous system, in all of the neurons in the
case of elav itself, but more generally in subsets of neurons
and/or neuroblasts and glial cells. Expression has also
been detected in other tissues, in particular in testes and
ovaries, or found to be ubiquitous (for instance [10]).
Diverse molecular functions in the control of RNA half
life, nuclear export, RNA 3' end formation, alternative
RNA processing, polyadenylation and translation have
been proposed for these proteins [9,11-17]. Multiple
functions, both cytoplasmic and nuclear have been demonstrated for HuR, an ubiquitously expressed member of
the human family [11,16,17].
The evolutionary relationship between members of the
family are complex. For instance, the four human proteins
share 74–91% identity, while the three Drosophila proteins share only 59–68% identity. The goal of the work
reported here was to investigate these relationships. We
found that the elav family has an eventful evolutionary
history, somewhat masked by the high level of amino acid
conservation of the gene products, but revealed by analysis of the gene structure of the different family members
(11 species, 23 proteins). We attribute the rapid functional evolution of the family members, as opposed to the
high level of sequence conservation, to the plasticity of the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/392

RRM domains, where small changes in critical positions
have the potential to modify interactions with RNA.

Results
The paralogs fne and rbp9 share a conserved organization
of their coding regions but elav, the third family member,
is distinct
All three Drosophila paralogs elav, rbp9 and fne are essentially expressed in neurons. elav null mutants are embryonic lethal, while the rbp9 null mutation is viable, but
surprisingly confers a female sterility phenotype. fne null
mutants, although not fully characterized, are also viable
(Zanini and Samson, in preparation). In order to understand the evolutionary mechanisms responsible for the
generation of these paralogs, we examined their gene
structure. Although their organizations are apparently
quite distinct, we found remarkable conservation in the
correspondance between exons and specific protein
regions in rbp9 and fne (Fig. 1A). There are two differences
(1) the presence of new mini-exons respectively specific
for each of the two genes and (2) the use of a single exon

in fne but two in rbp9 to encode the third RRM. Strikingly,
this organization is totally different in the elav gene,
whose complete ORF, except for the A of the ATG initiation codon, is encoded by a single exon.
Conserved exon junctions are present in most elav
orthologs
We took advantage of the recent sequencing of complete
genomes [18-22] to survey the gene family in 11 species
by (1) identifying all the family members and (2) comparing the organization of the ORF in exons. In humans, D.
melanogaster and C. elegans, we extracted from the databases protein sequences deduced from cDNA analyses,
and aligned genomic DNA with cDNA to determine the
exon-intron structure. In other cases we used the predicted
protein sequences, either published or computed for our
purpose, as detailed in the Methods. We examined species
from the chordata (1 species), arthropoda (9 species) and
nematoda (1 species), for a total of 23 genes (Fig. 2).

First, we found that the size of elav families varies (one to
four members) among the 11 species that we studied,
with no clear relationship between family size and brain/
animal complexity (Fig. 2). For instance, dipterans possess three elav genes, while the hymenopteran Apis mellifora, with ten times as many neurons as Drosophila,
possesses only one gene. Levels of identity between the
proteins encoded by the 23 genes are high, with the lowest
score (47%) obtained in the comparison of D. melanogaster ELAV with the unique C. elegans protein. Between
humans and Drosophila, there is 54–64% amino acid
identity in the ELAV-related proteins, 38% identity for the
arginase proteins (ubiquitous metabolic enzymes, see
below) and 33% identity for the engrailed proteins (conserved transcription factors, not shown). The levels of
ELAV-related protein identity are thus remarkable. The
crystal structure of the first two RRM of human HuD associated with cfos RNA, identifies 12 amino acids whose
side chain is making direct RNA contacts [23]. These residues are conserved in all 23 ELAV-like proteins that we
examined, except for the arginine in RNP1 of the second
RRM, which appears to be specific to the human proteins
and to one of the B. mori ELAV-like, Bm-2. In the other
species there is a conserved substitution by a lysine.
Second, we found remarkable conservation of exon structure. From vertebrates to invertebrates, we identified eight
exon junctions in the RRMs/hinge region (Fig. 3). We
named them J1 to J8, from the most upstream to the most
downstream. All are present in several phyla, except for J1
and J4 which are specific for FNE and RBP9 from Drosophila and are implicated in the generation of miniexons in the sequence coding (alternative forms of) these
proteins (Fig. 1 &3). Overall, the J2 junctions (respectively
J3, J5 and J8, Fig. 2 &3) are unambiguously homologous

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/392

since (1) the level of protein sequence conservation is
such that the amino acid positions where the junctions
intervene are clearly aligned and conserved (Fig. 3) and
(2) nucleotide sequence analysis shows that at a given
exon junction, the splice is at the same position in the
codons: specifically between the first and the second bases
of the spliced codons (for J2 and J5, as well as for the species-specific J1 and J4) or exactly between codons (J3 and
J8). There are two exceptions to this strict conservation.
First, J5 is interrupted in rbp9 of D. melanogaster by the
intronic insertion of an alternative mini-exon, without
alteration of the J5 5' or 3' splice sites. Second, in fne, J2 is
split by the intronic insertion of a mini-exon, the J2 donor
splice site is additionally shifted downstream while the J2
acceptor splice site is maintained (Fig. 3). Interestingly,
the junctions J2 and J5 occupy the same position relative
to RNP-1 in RRM1 and RRM2.
The junctions J6 and J7 map in a moderately conserved
coding region, essential for nuclear export and proper
subcellular localization (Reviewed in [2]), including only
a conserved hexamer (R-SP----). Both J6 and J7 split the
spliced codons between the second and the third bases. In
this region, three types of events affecting the splicing
seem to have occured independently: 1) the introduction
of a mini-exon (in humans), that can be alternatively
spliced (HuB), (2) the shift of the 5' splice site (example:
N. vitripennis vs T. castaneum) (3) the shift of the 3' splice
(example: the T. castaneum vs Ae-2 genes or the alternative
human forms HuD-366 and HuD-380). Noticeably, the
regions close respectively to J1/J2, J4/J5 and J6/J7 as well
as the entire hinge region between RRM2 and RRM3
appear more variable than the rest of the protein.
Intronless elav-like genes are present in Diptera and
Lepidoptera
Interestingly, for six of the analyzed genes (Ag-1, Ae-1, Cp1, elav in Diptera, and Bm-1, Bm-2 in Lepidoptera), the
entire conserved region of the protein is encoded by a single exon. Based upon both their gene structure and the
level of protein sequence identity, the dipteran intronless
genes constitute a homogeneous elav-type group. In contrast, although intronless like elav, the B. mori genes
encode proteins more similar to FNE/RBP9 than to ELAV.
This observation suggests that distinct evolutionary forces
shaped the B. mori genes and the dipteran elav-like intronless-genes, respectively. To evaluate this hypothesis, we
performed a phylogenetic analysis of the 27 ELAV
orthologs/paralogs, using the UPGMA algorithm, with
bootstrap analysis (Fig. 4). This analysis shows with high
confidence (bootstrap values greater or equal to 99%) that
in dipterans, the proteins encoded by the intronless genes
(Ag-1, Ae-1, Cp-1, elav) cluster together, while the two B.
mori genes products cluster with the FNE/RBP9 sequences
Similar results were obtained when performing sequence

alignments using the neighbor joining method (not
shown).
Because the D. melanogaster elav gene is nested in the third
intron of the arginase gene [24], we probed the gene envi-

ronment of the intronless elav orthologs that we report
here. We found that the nested elav/arg gene organization
is unique to Drosophila, specifically D. melanogaster and
11 additional Drosophila species whose genomes have
recently been sequenced [25] (Fig. 5). In the 10 other non-

Protein sequence comparison among 27 ELAV-like proteins forms. Alternative protein forms are included, specifically for Drosophila RBP9 (A and D) and three of the human proteins (HuB, HuC and HuD, where HuX-n refers to the n amino
acid long form of the HuX protein). "*" indicate that amino acids are identical in all 27 sequences, ":" and "." respectively indicate conserved and semi-conserved substitutions. The octamer RNP-1 and the hexamer RNP-2, diagnostic of RRMs, are
underlined. Also underlined is a conserved octamer present in the region that is crucial for nuclear export and localization. The
regions in light grey boxes have been mapped as necessary for these processes in D. melanogaster ELAV, human HuR and
human HuD. We identified eight exon junctions labelled J1 to J8 (see text). Bold characters and dark grey boxes are used to
identify amino acids encoded by exon junctions. When the splicing connects intact codons, two amino acids are bold (J3 and
J8). The symbol//replaces 85 non-conserved amino acids in the C. elegans sequence.

Drosophila species examined here, there is no close linkage between the arginase gene(s) and the elav gene family
members. In particular, the mosquitos, similar to D. melanogaster, each have three elav-like genes, including one
intronless version, but unlike D. melanogaster they have an
intronless arg, which obviously rules out the possibility of
a nested gene. In B. mori, although the two intronless Bm1 and Bm-2 genes map at loci distinct from the arg locus,
an intron putatively homologous to the third intron of the
D. melanogaster arginase gene is present (Fig. 5).

Discussion
The D. melanogaster gene elav is specific to the dipteran
phylum and results from retrotransposition
The elav gene from Drosophila was the first identified
member of this family, is considered as its prototype [1],
and most of the subsequently discovered orthologs are
named after it. However, the present analysis highlights
unique characteristics of this gene that suggest it is of
recent evolutionary origin, after the separation of dipterans and lepidopterans. Aside from elav, only the dipteran
genes Ae-1, Ag-1 and Cp-1 encode proteins that are more
similar to ELAV than to FNE and RBP9. In addition to the
intronless elav-likes, dipteran genomes carry two genes
encoding proteins of the type FNE/RBP9, also found in
the seven other genomes analyzed. Thus elav, Ae-1, Ag-1
and Cp-1 represent a newly evolved gene form specific to
dipterans.

In addition, the elav gene structure is suggestive of retrotransposition, a process considered significant in the evolution of genomes, including Drosophila [26]. The genes
Ae-1, Ag-1 and Cp-1 from mosquitoes share with elav not
only a higer level of similarity between their products, but
also the property of having their ORF in a single exon. The
absence of introns (restricted to dipterans and B. mori in
this gene family) is atypical: we identified conserved exon
junctions that are a landmark present in most of the elavrelated genes. Furthermore, the elav gene of Drosophila is
nested in the arginase gene. In humans, retrotransposition
is an important contributor to the generation of nested
genes [27]. We thus propose that elav originated from a
recent retrotransposition event. It is possible that the same
retrotransposition is at the origin of both the lepidopteran
intronless fne/rbp9-like genes and the dipteran elav-like
genes. A duplication of the retrotransposed gene in the
ancestor to B. mori and different fates for the ancestral
gene copies in the two groups would bring about the
present situation. Alternatively, we do not exclude that

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:392

independent retrotranspositions happened in lepidopteran and dipteran ancestral lineages.
Interestingly, the nested arg/elav arrangement found in D.
melanogaster is not conserved in the mosquitoes, where
the host gene (arginase) became intronless. This parallels
the nested arrangement of the intronless sina gene in an
intron of the Rh4 gene, as found in mosquitoes and nine
species of the Drosophila genus. The remaining three species of the genus have an intronless Rh4, with a loss of the
ancestral Rh4 copy where sina was originally embedded
[28]. These situations show the lability of nested gene
arrangements.
elav: the genesis of a new function
It was unexpected to find that the copy number of elav
family members varied from species to species. Given the
maintenance of this gene family in all metazoans, we
assume that there is a function for at least one, if not all,
of the genes in each species. Mutants have been reported
in only three species. The knockout of neuronal HuD in
mice causes motor and sensory defects [29]. It is not
excluded that the mild phenotype of this mutant is the
consequence of gene redundancy. In C. elegans, cholinergic synaptic transmission is altered in mutants of the single elav ortholog EXC-7, which is expressed in a subset of
neurons and other non-neuronal cells [30]. In both cases,
viability and apparent morphology are normal. In Drosophila melanogaster, the vital gene elav is required in all
neurons [1], whereas rbp9 is essential for female fertility
[7] but does not affect viability. We recently generated
null mutations of the fne gene (Zanini and Samson, in
preparation), whose preliminary analysis indicates that
they are viable in adults and lead to no apparent morphological defects. Aside from elav itself, characterized mutations of the elav gene family are viable, suggesting a nonvital function of the ancestral gene.

Considering that elav appears to be a new member of the
family, its vital function is quite striking. This situation is
reminescent of that of Sex-lethal (Sxl), a gene fundamental
to sex determination in Drosophila, but which does not
act as a sex determining factor in non-Drosophilids. The
Drosophilid genomes indeed contain two Sxl paralogs
(79% identity in D. melanogaster), while non-Drosophilids have one. It has been proposed that there was a duplication of the ancestral gene in Drosophilids and
acquisition of a new function by one of the copies [31].
We believe that a retrotransposition of the elav/fne/rbp9
ancestor gene at the time of the separation of dipterans/
lepidopterans led to a gene duplication and the evolution
of a new function for elav.

Conserved RNA binding proteins: a reservoir for
accelerated functional evolution
We have pointed out that the ELAV-like proteins, including ELAV itself, have maintained a high level of sequence
conservation between species, higher than that of
engrailed, a conserved transcription factor with a homeodomain, or that of arginase, a ubiquitous metabolic
enzyme that arose before the divergence of procaryotes
and eucaryotes. This is intriguing in light of the extensively documented diversity of the properties of individual members of the family. First, although there is
expression in the nervous system of at least one of the elav
family members in every investigated metazoan (mammals, fishes, amphibians, birds, amphioxus, C. elegans, D.
melanogaster), expression is also detected in other tissues
and is even sometimes ubiquitous [2]. Second, the functions of these proteins are multiple, whether at the cellular
level, where they include cell differentiation/survival
[1,6,29,32] and cell proliferation/control of the cell cycle
[7,33] or at the biological level, with impacts on motor/
sensory activity, memory, fertility or viability [1,6,29,34].
Finally, the apparent subcellular localization of these proteins is diverse (nuclear, subnuclear, cytoplasmic or both),
in agreement with diverse molecular functions [2,3].

The data thus reveal a diversification of the functions and
of the specificity of expression of ELAV family members
and implies a diversification of the interactions with other
macromolecules, most evidently the RNAs whose metabolism is regulated by the RRM containing proteins. The
DNA duplications and retrotranspositions that occured in
the elav gene families constitute a starting point for the
diversification of gene function. Changes in cell or tissue
specificity of expression are often linked to modifications
of non-translated regulatory regions. However, changes
affecting the sub-cellular localization, known to be
dependent upon the hinge region between RRM2 and
RRM3, or changes in the interactions with proteins or
RNA must depend upon the protein product of the elavlike genes.
Sequence alignments of the ELAV-like proteins shows that
they are overall very conserved. But we were puzzeld by
the fact some of the conserved exon junctions (J1/J2, J4/J5
and J6/J7) are adjacent to sequences that are among the
most variable of the proteins. They include short insertions of amino acids, (alternative) exon addition and
amino acid variations. The intron sequence indeed provides a potential source of sequence variability: it is conceivable that intron extremities become integrated into
coding sequences by shifting of the exon boundaries.
Alternatively, the intron can serve as the site of insertion
of a new exon. An additional surprising point was the fact
that these variable micro regions are almost directly
upstream of important conserved motifs, specifically

Page 7 of 11

RNP-1 (in RRM1 and RRM2) and the octapeptide in the
region essential for nuclear export and subcellular localization. The modification of residues outside of the RNP
has the potential to alter the interactions between the
RRM and an RNA [5]. Additionally, alterations of the
region responsible for nuclear export/cellular localization
modify this function (reviewed in [2]). We thus propose
that the maintenance of the exon junctions is vital to the
evolution of the ELAV family, in particular the generation
of new functions. As a consequence, one would predict
that RRM1, RRM2 and the hinge region have prominent
roles in functional specificity. It may be significant in this
respect that RRM3 replacements in ELAV by RRM3 from
RBP9 or HUD are fully functional, while RRM1 or RRM2
replacements by corresponding RRMs from RBP9 or SXL
are largely non-functional [35].
More generally, it seems that RRM-containing proteins
could serve as favorable targets for the rapid evolution of
gene functions. Because of the structural versatility of the
RRM domain, it can be adapted for sequence specific recognition of many different nucleic acid structures and different protein partners [5]. The SXL protein, a crucial
regulator of sex determination in Drosophila contains 2
RRM, and appears to be the result of such a rapid adaptation of function. In the search for genetic changes that distinguish our brains from that of our ancestors, the focus
has been on the identification of non-synonymous
changes in coding regions and the modification of regulatory sequences [36]. Our work suggests that the very conserved RRM-containing proteins may have contributed to
human brain evolution, especially when considering the
fundamental importance of the regulation of RNA metabolism in neurons, where alternative splicing [37] and
localized RNA translation and degradation [38,39] take
place with impacts on cortex development, neuronal
regeneration and plasticity.

Conclusion
The elav gene family encodes proteins with three RNA Recognition Motifs (RRM) acting as neuronal post-transcriptional regulators in all metazoans. Since they show
remarkable sequence conservation, the documented
diversity of their molecular roles is unexpected. We report
the occurence of elav-like gene duplications and deletions
in metazoans, and show that the vital elav gene of Drosophila is newly emerged, specific to dipterans and of retrotransposed origin, challenging its status of prototype for
the family. These findings, together with the plasticity of
the interactions between RRM and RNA, suggests that the
elav-like proteins may have played an important role in
the evolution of the gene functions crucial in brain evolution.

Methods
cDNA sequences used for the analysis of coding sequence
organization in the elav gene family of Drosophila
melanogaster
We used the transcripts data from FlyBase [18] to assess
the relationship between RNA and protein coding regions.
Multiple RNA isoforms from one gene were taken into
account if they were a source of polypeptide diversity. For
instance, seven alternative RNA forms have been reported
for rbp9, which are predicted to encode six distinct
polypeptides. Only one level of variation was relevant to
the present analysis, that is the alternative inclusion of a
mini-exon that causes the addition of 15 nucleotides (five
amino acids), hence the choice of using the rbp9-A and the
rbp9-D RNA forms, that differ by the presence/absence of
the mini exon. In the case of both fne and elav, several
transcripts have been reported but they encode a single
polypeptide.
Identification of elav orthologs in completely sequenced
genomes and prediction of ELAV-like protein sequences
We used protein sequences from the data bases deduced
from cDNA analysis whenever possible, with NCBI accession numbers as follows: in humans BAD92531 (HuB,
367 amino acids), AAH30692/Q12926-2 (HuB, 346 aa),
AAA58677 (HuC, 359 AA), AAH14144/Q14576 (HuC,
367 AA), AAH36071/Q8IYD4 (HuD, 366 aa), AAK57541/
AAK57541 (HuD, 380 aa), AAH03376/Q15717 (HuR,
326 aa), in D. melanogaster AAA28506 (ELAV, 483 aa),
AAF43091 (FNE, 356 aa), AAF51179 (RBP9 isoform A,
647 aa) and AAN10401 (RBP9 isoform D, 642 aa), in
Caenorhabditis elegans NP_496057 (EXC-7, 456 aa). UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot Accession numbers are also provided
for further details on the proteins: Q12926 (HuB),
Q14576 (HuC), Q8IYD4 (HuD), Q15717 (HuR), P16914
(ELAV,), Q9VYI0 (FNE), Q9VQJ0 (RBP9) and Q20084
(EXC-7).

When no cDNA sequences were available, we performed
searches of the entire genomes using the tblastn program
[40] to identify orthologs of ELAV-related genes. We analyzed the genomic regions encoding these orthologs by
performing a three frame translation of the genomic
sequences, and using the gene prediction program genescan [41] as well as a splice site prediction program [42].
The predicted protein coding sequences were the result of
integration and manual review of these data.
Using the procedures detailed above to identify elav
orthologs, we reviewed predicted protein sequences that
have been proposed for Apis mellifora, Aedes aegypti and
Anopheles gambiae [19]. Some of our conclusions were
consistent with the automated predictions of genome
projects (A. mellifora, XP_394166, 343 aa), but we edited
sequences of A. aegypti, and A. gambiae ELAV orthologs.

Page 8 of 11

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:392

The decision of editing was based upon the identification
of manifest errors in the automated predictions, such as
the prediction of a four base pair intron 5'-CCCT-3', missing the consensus GT-AG sequences typically flanking
introns for the Ag-3 predicted transcript (XM_309157).
For those two species, as well as for those where no prediction had yet been proposed, we relied upon the above
procedure to identify and propose predicted sequences of
ELAV orthologs. They respectively derive from genomic
sequences CH477489 (Ae-1), CH477672 (Ae-2),
CH477401(Ae-3) in A. aegypti, from CM000357 (Ag-1),
CM000360 (Ag-2), CM000359 (Ag-3) in A. Gambiae,
DS231997 (Cp-1), DS232556 (Cp-2), DS231816 (Cp-3)
in Culex pipiens, CM000276 in Tribolium castaneum,
DS265619 in Nasonia vitripennis, AADK01020611 (Bm1), CH391062 (Bm-2) in Bombyx mori and DS235033 in
Pediculus humanus corporis.

In our analysis we used only the approximately 325
amino acids region of the proteins including the three
RRM and a hinge region that links RRM2 and RRM3,
because the N-terminus, when present, is not conserved.
The sequences used are listed in Additional file 1.
Identification of arginase genes in completely sequenced
genomes and prediction of arginase protein sequences
Arginase sequences have been deduced from cDNA
sequences for several species: human (ARG1: P05089,
Arg2: P78540), D. melanogaster (Q9NHA5), C. elegans
(Q22659). For the other species, we used the procedure
described above to propose arginase sequences. The protein sequences derive from genomic sequences
CH477248 in A. aegypti, from CM000359 in A. gambiae,
DS232533 in C. pipiens, CM000280 in T. castaneum,
DS265617 in N. vitripennis, CH389642 in B. mori and
DS235286 in P. humanus corporis. We were not able to predict a complete P. humanus corporis arginase sequence,
because of the lower level of conservation. See Additional
file 2 for the arginase sequences.
Protein sequence alignments and percentages of identity
Alignments were performed with the ClustalW program
using default parameters [43]. In the case of arginases, we
focused on the region homologous to that including
intron 3 in D. melanogaster. The values for percentages of
identity were extracted from the ClustalW score tables.
