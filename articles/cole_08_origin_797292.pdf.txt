Leprosy, a chronic, neurological human disease, results
from infection with the obligate intracellular pathogen,
Mycobacterium leprae, a close relative of the tubercle bacillus. M. leprae has the longest doubling time of all known
bacteria and has never been cultured in the laboratory.
Comparison of the 3.27 Mb genome sequence of an armadillo-derived Indian isolate of the leprosy bacillus with
that of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (4.4 Mb) provides clear
explanations for these properties, revealing an extreme
case of reductive evolution. Less than half of the genome
contains functional genes while pseudogenes, with intact
counterparts in M. tuberculosis, are abundant. Gene deletion and decay have eliminated many important metabolic activities including siderophore production, part of
the oxidative, and all of the microaerophilic and anaerobic respiratory chains, together with numerous, alternative catabolic systems and their regulatory circuits.
Genome decay has thus led to metabolic crippling.

a single clone of M. leprae whose dissemination worldwide could be retraced from SNP analysis. The disease
seems to have originated in Eastern Africa or the Near East
and spread with successive human migrations. Europeans
or North Africans appear to have introduced leprosy into
West Africa and the Americas within the past 500 years.

To develop tools for molecular epidemiology, we
sequenced the genome of a Brazilian isolate of M. leprae,
chosen because of the high prevalence of leprosy in that
country and its great distance from India. In light of the
extensive gene decay observed in the Indian strain multiple examples of pseudogene formation and numerous
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were expected.
Astonishingly, the two genome sequences were nearly
identical differing by a single pseudogene and a mere 118
SNP, distributed almost equally between genes and pseudogenes. On surveying over 300 leprosy biopsies, 78 SNP
were found to be informative. Phylogenetic studies
revealed that all extant cases of leprosy are attributable to
