Abstract
Background: Acyl-acyl carrier protein thioesterases (acyl-ACP TEs) catalyze the hydrolysis of the thioester bond that
links the acyl chain to the sulfhydryl group of the phosphopantetheine prosthetic group of ACP. This reaction
terminates acyl chain elongation of fatty acid biosynthesis, and in plant seeds it is the biochemical determinant of
the fatty acid compositions of storage lipids.
Results: To explore acyl-ACP TE diversity and to identify novel acyl ACP-TEs, 31 acyl-ACP TEs from wide-ranging
phylogenetic sources were characterized to ascertain their in vivo activities and substrate specificities. These acylACP TEs were chosen by two different approaches: 1) 24 TEs were selected from public databases on the basis of
phylogenetic analysis and fatty acid profile knowledge of their source organisms; and 2) seven TEs were
molecularly cloned from oil palm (Elaeis guineensis), coconut (Cocos nucifera) and Cuphea viscosissima, organisms
that produce medium-chain and short-chain fatty acids in their seeds. The in vivo substrate specificities of the acylACP TEs were determined in E. coli. Based on their specificities, these enzymes were clustered into three classes: 1)
Class I acyl-ACP TEs act primarily on 14- and 16-carbon acyl-ACP substrates; 2) Class II acyl-ACP TEs have broad
substrate specificities, with major activities toward 8- and 14-carbon acyl-ACP substrates; and 3) Class III acyl-ACP
TEs act predominantly on 8-carbon acyl-ACPs. Several novel acyl-ACP TEs act on short-chain and unsaturated acylACP or 3-ketoacyl-ACP substrates, indicating the diversity of enzymatic specificity in this enzyme family.
Conclusion: These acyl-ACP TEs can potentially be used to diversify the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway to
produce novel fatty acids.

Background
De novo fatty acid biosynthesis can be considered an
iterative “polymerization” process, commonly primed
with the acetyl moiety from acetyl-CoA and with iterative chain extension occurring by reaction with malonylACP. In most organisms this process optimally produces
16- and 18-carbon (C16 and C18) fatty acids. The
enzyme that determines fatty acid chain length is acylacyl carrier protein thioesterase (acyl-ACP TE). This

enzyme catalyzes the terminal reaction of fatty acid biosynthesis, acyl-ACP thioester bond hydrolysis to release
a free fatty acid and ACP.
In discrete phyla and/or tissues of specific organisms
(primarily higher plant seeds), thioester hydrolysis optimally produces medium-chain (C8-C14) fatty acids
(MCFAs), which have wide industrial applications (e.g.,
producing detergents, lubricants, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals) [1]. TEs that specifically hydrolyze medium-chain acyl-ACP substrates have been studied widely
[1-3]. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs; e.g. butanoic acid
and hexanoic acid) have more recently gained importance as potential biorenewable chemicals that could be
derived from the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway [4]. As

a critical acyl chain termination enzyme, acyl-ACP TEs
with desired substrate specificities are therefore important for engineering this pathway.
To date, dozens of acyl-ACP TEs have been functionally characterized and sorted into two classes, FatA and
FatB [5]. FatA-class TEs act on long-chain acyl-ACPs,
preferentially on oleoyl-ACP [5-8], while FatB-class TEs
preferably hydrolyze acyl-ACPs with saturated fatty acyl
chains [5]. The archetypical FatB-class TE was isolated
from the developing seeds of California bay (Umbellularia californica). This enzyme is specific for 12:0-ACP,
and it plays a critical role in MCFA production [2,9].
This discovery spurred isolation of additional MCFAspecific TEs from Cuphea [1,10,11], Arabidopsis thaliana [12], Myristica fragrans (nutmeg) [13], and Ulmus
americana (elm) [13].
Recently, TEs obtained from public databases were
classified into 23 families based on sequence and threedimensional structure similarity [14]. These TEs were
defined as enzymes that can hydrolyze any thioester
bond irrespective of the chemical nature of the carboxylic acid and thiol molecules that constitute the substrates of these enzymes. The TE sequences are
collected in the constantly updated ThYme database
[15]. Of these 23 families, Family TE14 contains plant
and bacterial acyl-ACP TEs involved in Type II fatty
acid synthesis, whose reactions are catalyzed by discrete
monofunctional enzymes. When this study was conducted (summer and fall 2010), Family TE14 contained
360 unique sequences, but only ~7% of these sequences,
all of which were FatA and FatB TEs from higher plants,
had been functionally characterized. The remaining
~220 bacterial acyl-ACP TEs were mostly generated
from genomic sequencing projects and had never been
functionally characterized.
Here we report the results of a two-pronged approach
to identify acyl-ACP TEs with novel substrate specificities, which potentially could allow researchers to better
infer biochemical properties of closely related sequences.
This strategy includes the functional characterization of
diverse acyl-ACP TEs 1) rationally chosen based on phylogenetic classification of the enzymes and 2) isolated
from organisms that are known to produce MCFAs and
SCFAs. Functional characterization of 31 acyl-ACP TEs
from diverse organisms led to the discovery that several
novel TEs can be used to produce short-chain and unsaturated fatty acids as well as methylketones.

Experimental Procedures
Phylogenetic analyses

Sequences from Family TE14 [14] in the ThYme database were downloaded from the GenBank [16] and UniProt [17] databases. Fragments and incomplete
sequences were removed, yielding 360 acyl-ACP TE

sequences. A multiple sequence alignment (MSA) was
generated from catalytic domains of these sequences
using MUSCLE 3.6 [18] with default parameters. An
unrooted phylogenetic tree based on the MSA was built
using Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis 4
(MEGA4) [19]. The minimum evolution algorithm was
used due to its high effectiveness with large data sets
[20], gaps were subjected to pairwise deletion, and an
amino acid Jones-Taylor-Thornton (JTT) [21] distance
model was chosen. The phylogenetic tree was further
verified by a bootstrap test with 1000 replicates. The
bootstrapped consensus tree was qualitatively analyzed
and broken into apparent subfamilies. Statistical analysis
was conducted to show that all sequences within a subfamily were more closely related to each other than to
sequences in other subfamilies. Based on the MSA, JTT
distances between all sequences were calculated and
arranged into a j × j matrix, where j is the total number
of sequences. Inter-subfamily distances and variances
were determined using this matrix. For each apparent
subfamily, a smaller k × k matrix, where k is the number
of sequences in a given subfamily, was calculated. From
this, intra-subfamily mean distances and variances were
determined. These values were applied to the following
equation to determine z:
z=

xij − xii + xjj /2
2
2
σi2 σii σjj
+
+
nij nii njj

where xij , xii , and xjj are the inter- and intra-subfamily
mean JTT distances, nij, nii, and njj are the total number
2
2
of taxa used for each x value, and σi2 , σii , and σjj are
the pooled inter- and intra-subfamily variances [22].
A z-value > 3.3 between two subfamilies shows that
the difference between them is statistically significant to
p < 0.001. If a z-value between two apparent subfamilies
were < 3.3, alternative apparent subfamilies were chosen
and/or individual sequences were removed, and the statistical calculations were repeated. Subfamilies were
finally defined with a phylogenetic tree in which all zvalues exceeded 3.3, sometimes leaving some sequences
outside any subfamily (i.e. non-grouped sequences).
All sequences within individual subfamilies were
aligned using MUSCLE 3.6, and rooted phylogenetic
trees were built in MEGA4 with the same tree and
bootstrap parameters as described above. A few
sequences from another subfamily (that with the highest
z-value) were chosen to root individual subfamily trees.
DNA synthesis

cDNA sequences encoding acyl-ACP TEs were codonoptimized for expression in E. coli using the

Jing et al. BMC Biochemistry 2011, 12:44
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/12/44

OptimumGene codon optimization program provided by
GenScript USA (Piscataway, NJ, USA). Sequences were
both synthesized and cloned into vectors by GenScript.
BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites were added to the 5’
and 3’ ends of each sequence, and products were cloned
into the pUC57 vector.
Cloning of acyl-ACP TE cDNAs from coconut (Cocos
nucifera) and Cuphea viscosissima

Coconut fruits of different developmental stages were
obtained from the USDA-ARS-SHRS National Germplasm Repository (Miami, FL, USA). Seeds of C. viscosissima were obtained from the North Central Regional
Plant Introduction Station (NCRPIS, Ames, IA, USA).
They were treated overnight with 0.1 mM gibberellic
acid and then germinated in a growth chamber (Environmental Growth Chambers, Chagrin Falls, OH) with
12 h of illumination at 25°C followed by 12 h of darkness at 15°C. Seedlings were transplanted into soil and
cultivated at NCRPIS. Seeds at different developmental
stages were collected and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Acyl-ACP TE cDNAs were cloned from C. viscosissima and coconut via a homologous cloning strategy.
MSAs of plant TE14 sequences revealed two conserved
regions (RYPTWGD and NQHVNNVK), from which
two degenerate primers, DP-F3 (5’-AGNTAYCCNACNTGGGGNGA-3’) and DP-R3 (5’-TACTTNACRTTRTTNACRTGYTGRTT-3’), were designed.
RNA was extracted from endosperm of nearly mature
coconuts and immature seeds of C. viscosissima using
the total RNA (plant) kit (IBI Scientific, Peosta, IA,
USA). RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using the
SuperScript™ first-strand synthesis system for RT-PCR
kit (Invitrogen, Carlsberg, CA, USA). PCR was performed in a 50-μL reaction mixture containing 20 ng
cDNA, 1× Pfx buffer, 1 mM MgSO 4 , 0.3 mM dNTP,
5.12 μM DP-F3 and DP-R3 primers, and 0.5 U Pfx polymerase (Invitrogen) using a cycling program of 94°C for
4 min, 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 52°C for 30 s and 72°
C for 45 s, and a final extension step of 72°C for 5 min.
The expected ~350-bp products were identified by agarose gel electrophoresis, and their DNA bands were
recovered using the QiaQuick gel extraction kit (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA, USA) and cloned into the pENTR TOPO
TA vector (Invitrogen). Using primers designed from
the sequences of the cloned 350-bp fragments, the 5’and 3’- ends of the cDNAs were obtained using the
SMARTer RACE (rapid amplification of the cDNA
ends) cDNA amplification kit (Takara Bio, Otsu, Japan).
For each acyl-ACP TE sequence, the full-length
cDNA, minus the N-terminal chloroplast transit peptide,
was amplified by PCR with primers engineered to introduce BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites at the 5’- and
3’-ends, respectively. The PCR-amplified products were

digested with BamHI and EcoRI and cloned into the
corresponding restriction sites of the pUC57 vector,
which placed the acyl-ACP TE sequence under the transcriptional control of the lacZ promoter. The sequence
of each construct was confirmed by sequencing both
strands. Confirmed expression vectors of coconut genes
were transformed into E. coli strain K27, while
sequences of C. viscosissima acyl-ACP TEs were synthesized after being codon-optimized.
In vivo activity assay

E. coli strain K27 contains a mutation in the fadD gene
impairing b-oxidation of fatty acids, which results in the
accumulation of free fatty acids in the growth medium
[23,24]. Each TE was expressed in E. coli K27, and free
fatty acids that accumulated in the medium were
extracted and analyzed. Four colonies for each construct
were independently cultured in 2 mL LB medium supplemented with 100 mg/L carbicillin in 17-mL culture
tubes. When the culture reached an OD600 of ~0.7, the
growth medium was replaced with 3 mL of M9 minimal
medium (47.7 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 22.1 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 8.6
mM NaCl, 18.7 mM NH 4 Cl, 2 mM MgSO 4 , and 0.1
mM CaCl2 ) supplemented with 0.4% glucose and 100
mg/L carbicillin, and 10 μM isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to induce acyl-ACP TE
expression. After 40 h of cultivation, cells were pelleted,
and free fatty acids in the supernatant were extracted
essentially following a previously described method
[25,26]. Briefly, 2 mL of culture supernatant was supplemented with 10 μg heptanoic acid (7:0), 10 μg undecanoic acid (11:0), and 20 μg heptadecanoic acid (17:0)
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) as internal standards. The mixture was acidified with 20 μL of 1 M
HCl, and 4 mL chloroform-methanol (1:1 vol/vol) was
used to recover the fatty acids from the medium. After
vortexing for 10 min and centrifuging at 1000 × g for 4
min, the lower chloroform phase was transferred to a
new tube and evaporated under a stream of N2 gas until
the samples were concentrated to ~300 μL. Samples (1
μL) were analyzed on an Agilent Technologies (Santa
Clara, CA, USA) 6890 Series gas chromatograph (GC)
system used with an Agilent 5973 mass selective detector equipped with an Agilent CP-Wax 58 FFAP CB column (25 m × 0.15 mm × 0.39 mm). The GC program
followed an initial temperature of 70°C for 2 min,
ramped to 150°C at 10°C/min and held for 3 min,
ramped to 260°C at 10°C/min, and held for 14 min.
Final quantification analysis was performed with AMDIS
software (National Institute of Standards and Technology). Determination of C4 to C8, C10 to C12, and >
C12 fatty acid concentrations was based on the fatty
acid internal standards 7:0, 11:0, and 17:0, respectively.
The total concentration of fatty acids produced by each

Jing et al. BMC Biochemistry 2011, 12:44
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/12/44

acyl-ACP TE was obtained by subtracting the concentration of fatty acid produced by E. coli expressing a
control plasmid (pUC57) lacking a TE from that produced by E. coli expressing a given acyl-ACP TE
sequence from the same vector. The three most abundant fatty acids produced by the control strain were 8:0
(2.0 nmol/mL), 14:0 (3.5 nmol/mL), and 16:0 (3.1 nmol/
mL), and their levels were minimal compared to strains
expressing acyl-ACP TEs. Compared to GC analyses of
fatty acids after derivatization (e.g., methylation or butylation), our GC-MS method uses non-derivatized free
fatty acids, which is better optimized for analyzing
short-chain fatty acids (e.g., 4:0, 6:0, 8:0, 10:0, 12:0, and
14:0). However, this method may be less sensitive for
longer-chain fatty acids (e.g., 18:0 and 18:1).
Identification of the methylketone 2-tridecanone

Analysis of free fatty acids revealed possible peaks characteristic of 2-tridecanone. To further confirm this identification, retention times and MS spectra of the peaks
in each sample were compared to a 2-tridecanone standard (Sigma-Aldrich).
Statistical cluster analysis

To classify acyl-ACP TEs based on their in vivo activities, the fatty acid composition data obtained from the
in vivo expression of all TE sequences studied herein
were used to perform statistical clustering analysis. The
distance matrix was calculated using Euclidean distances, and Ward’s method [27] was used to perform
agglomerative hierarchical clustering. The p-values were
calculated via multiscale bootstrap resampling with 1000
replicates [28].

Results
Two complementary approaches were taken to understand the breadth of substrate specificities exhibited by
acyl-ACP TEs isolated from different taxa. In the first
approach, we used phylogenetic analysis of all Family
TE14 members of known or predicted function to strategically choose diverse TE sequences that were then
expressed and functionally characterized. In the second
approach, previously uncharacterized acyl-ACP TEs
were cloned from seeds of plants known to produce
seed oils containing SCFAs and MCFAs.
Phylogenetic analysis and identification of acyl-ACP TEs

A total of 360 amino acid sequences belonging to
Family TE14 [14] were subjected to phylogenetic analysis and grouped into subfamilies. A subfamily is defined
as having at least five sequences from different species,
and it must pass the statistical tests described in the
experimental procedures. Ten subfamilies met these criteria (Figure 1 and Additional file 1, Table A1),

Page 4 of 16

accounting for 326 TE sequences; in addition 34 TE
sequences could not be grouped into any of these subfamilies. All z-values were > 3.4, ranging from 3.41 to
29.7, and mean distances between different subfamilies
were larger than those within subfamilies (Additional
file 1, Table A1). Individual trees of each subfamily
appear in Additional files 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11,
Figures A1 through A10).
Family TE14 contains acyl-ACP TEs that had previously been characterized from plants and classified
into two types, FatA and FatB [5]. Of the ten subfamilies
identified in this study, Subfamilies A, B, and C are
comprised of acyl-ACP TEs found in plants. All experimentally characterized sequences previously classified as
FatB acyl-ACP TEs make up ~25% of Subfamily A
(Additional file 2, Figure A1), which contains 81 angiosperm-sourced sequences. The coconut and C. viscosissima acyl-ACP TEs identified in this study also belong
to this subfamily. Subfamily B, which comprises 21
sequences primarily sourced from angiosperms as well
as from the moss Physcomitrella patens (Additional file
3, Figure A2), represents a potentially novel plant acylACP TE subfamily with no previous experimental or
phylogenetic characterization. Plant FatA acyl-ACP TEs,
which act on long-chain acyl-ACP molecules, especially
oleoyl-ACP [5], belong to the 32-member Subfamily C
(Additional file 4, Figure A3). As with Subfamily B, the
six green algal sequences from Chlamydomonas, Ostreococcus, and Micromonas (Additional file 5, Figure A4)
that comprise Subfamily D have not been experimentally
characterized.
Unlike several plant acyl-ACP TEs, no bacterial acylACP TEs had been functionally characterized. A total of
186 bacterial acyl-ACP TE sequences were classified
into six subfamilies (Subfamily E-Subfamily J). All 17
acyl-ACP TE sequences from gram-negative bacteria are
in Subfamily E (Additional file 6, Figure A5), which
includes sequences from halophilic (Salinibacter and
Rhodothermus), sulfate-reducing (Desulfovibrio, Desulfohalobium, and Desulfonatronospira), chemoorganotrophic (Spirosoma), metal-reducing (Anaeromyxobacter,
Geobacter, and Pelobacter), and marine (Microscilla)
bacteria. Subfamily F consists of 24 sequences, mainly
from Bacteroides but also from other related bacteria
(Additional file 7, Figure A6). Protein Data Bank (PDB)
structure 2ESS (Figure 2), obtained from a structural
genomic effort, is part of this subfamily. Subfamily G
and Subfamily H have 31 and 27 sequences, respectively,
primarily from Clostridium (Additional files 8 and 9,
Figures A7 and A8). Subfamily I is comprised of eight
sequences (Additional file 10, Figure A9) from six genera. Gram-positive lactic acid bacteria, almost completely from the genera Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, and
Streptococcus, are part of Subfamily J (79 sequences;

locations of characterized sequences. A detailed tree for each individual subfamily can be found in Additional files 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,

Additional file 11, Figure A10). PDB:2OWN (Figure 2),
the second bacterial acyl-ACP TE structure obtained
from a structural genomic effort, appears in this family.
Although the two known Family TE14 crystal structures
(PDB:2ESS in Subfamily F and PDB:2OWN in Subfamily
J) are from organisms in widely separated subfamilies,
they are highly similar, as may be expected since they
are members of the same enzyme family (Figure 2).
Some Family TE14 sequences are not grouped into
any subfamily because their inclusion decreased z-values
below acceptable limits. These include two plant and
four moss sequences adjacent to Subfamilies A and C,
and 28 bacterial sequences more closely related to

Subfamilies E to I. No experimental work had previously
been done on any of these sequences.
Upon generating the phylogenetic relationships among
the 360 acyl-ACP TE sequences predicted or experimentally placed in Family TE14, 25 were chosen for experimental characterization. Of these, the cDNA for 24 was
synthesized, while the cDNA of the Elaeis guineensis (oil
palm) acyl-ACP TE was isolated from a phage cDNA
library previously constructed from mRNA isolated from
the developing fruit of Indonesian-sourced oil palm.
The selection of acyl-ACP TEs to characterize was
based upon the primary structure-based phylogenetic
relationships among the enzymes, along with knowledge

of the fatty acid profile of the source organisms of these
acyl-ACP TEs. Briefly, at least one TE was characterized
from each of the ten subfamilies except for Subfamily C,
whose members appear to be specific for oleoyl-ACP
substrates. For subfamilies that contain acyl-ACP TEs
originating from organisms without any known fatty
acid data, or from organisms where acyl-ACP TEs were
not previously characterized, we chose to investigate
acyl-ACP TE sequences that are evolutionarily distant
from each other within each subfamily. For example,
within Subfamily A there are two distinct and separate
groupings of acyl-ACP TEs that are derived from the
Poaceae family, for which there is no functional characterization (Table 1, containing refs. [29-35], and Additional file 2, Figure A1). One grouping contains one
sorghum acyl-ACP TE sequence (GenBank:EER87824)
and the other contains two (GenBank:EER88593 and
GenBank:EES04698). To explore this structural divergence as an indicator of potential functional divergence
in substrate specificities, one each of these Subfamily A
sorghum acyl-ACP TEs (GenBank:EER87824 and GenBank:EER88593) and the two Subfamily B sorghum acylACP TEs were expressed and functionally characterized.
Isolation and sequence analysis of acyl-ACP TEs from
coconut and C. viscosissima

MCFAs are abundant in the oil produced in fruits of
coconut (i.e. predominantly C12 and C14 and a small
amount (0.2-1%) of C6 fatty acids [36-38]) and seeds of
C. viscosissima (i.e. predominantly C8 and C10 fatty
acids [39]). Therefore, acyl-ACP TEs in the seeds of

Page 6 of 16

these species are predicted to be specific for mediumchain acyl-ACPs. Acyl-ACP TE sequences were isolated
from coconut and C. viscosissima by a homologous
cloning strategy. Using degenerate primers, which were
designed from conserved regions of plant TE14 family
enzymes, a 350-bp fragment in the middle of the
mRNAs was amplified from cDNA generated from both
developing coconut endosperm and C. viscosissima
seeds. Sequencing of cloned PCR products identified
three new acyl-ACP TE sequences each from coconut
and C. viscosissima. The full-length cDNA sequences
were obtained by RACE for three acyl-ACP TEs
[CnFatB1 (JF338903), CnFatB2 (JF338904), and CnFatB3
(JF338905)] from coconut and three [CvFatB1
(JF338906), CvFatB2 (JF338907), and CvFatB3
(JF338908)] from C. viscosissima.
The predicted open reading frames of coconut and C.
viscosissima acyl-ACP TE cDNAs were identified. They
encode pre-proteins of 412 to 423 amino acids, with calculated molecular weights of 45.8 to 46.5 kDa and theoretical pIs of 6.4 to 8.8. Plant acyl-ACP TEs are nuclearencoded, plastid-targeted proteins with an N-terminal
plastid-targeting peptide extension [2]. For each of the
cloned coconut and C. viscosissima acyl-ACPs TEs, the
putative plastid-targeting peptide cleavage site was
located on the N-terminal side of the conserved
sequence LPDW (Figure 3), as proposed for many other
plant acyl-ACP TEs [5,8,12,40,41]. These yield predicted
mature proteins of 323 to 331 amino acid residues [42],
with calculated molecular weights of 36.6 to 37.5 kDa
and theoretical pIs of 5.4 to 7.3. Alignment of the
deduced amino acid sequences of coconut and C. viscosissima acyl-ACP TE cDNAs showed that, except for
the plastid-targeting peptide sequences and very near
the C-terminus, the sequences are colinear and share
very high identity (63-86%) within a species (Figure 3).
These sequences cluster within Subfamily A (Additional
file 2, Figure A1).
Determination of in vivo activities of acyl-ACP TEs

All isolated acyl-ACP TE cDNAs were expressed in E.
coli strain K27. Secreted fatty acids were analyzed with
GC-MS, and the total fatty acid yield in the medium
was used to represent the in vivo activities of these
enzymes on acyl-ACPs, though it remains possible that
some of these enzymes might also hydrolyze acyl-CoAs
[43].
A total of 13 acyl-ACP TEs from Subfamily A were
characterized, including single acyl- ACP TEs from
Cuphea palustris (GenBank:AAC49179), U. americana
(GenBank:AAB71731), and oil palm (E. guineensis, GenBank:AAD42220), two each from Iris germanica (GenBank:AAG43857 and GenBank:AAG43858) and
Sorghum bicolor (GenBank:EER87824 and GenBank:

acyl-ACP TEs varied from 9 to 380 nmol/mL (Table 1).

These four acyl-ACP TEs showed similar substrate specificities, producing predominantly 14:0 (34-65 mol%)
and 16:1 (23-37 mol%) fatty acids (Figure 4D).
Eleven acyl-ACP TE sequences from Subfamilies E to
J sourced from bacteria and three bacterial sequences
not placed in any subfamily were characterized (Table 1,
Figure 5, and Additional file 12, Table A2). Based on
their substrate specificities, these acyl-ACP TEs were
classified into two groups. One group produced primarily SCFAs and MCFAs (> 75 mol% 4:0 to 8:0 fatty
acids). This group included acyl-ACP TEs from Anaerococcus tetradius (GenBank:EEI82564, no subfamily, 87%
8:0), Clostridium perfringens (GenBank:ABG82470, Subfamily G, 14% 6:0 and 70% 8:0), Lactobacillus brevis
(GenBank:ABJ63754, Subfamily J, 7% 4:0, 14% 6:0, and
55% 8:0), and Lactobacillus plantarum (GenBank:
CAD63310, Subfamily J, 11% 6:0 and 68% 8:0) (Figure 5
and Additional file 12, Table A2). The other group
showed broad- and binary-range substrate specificities.
The binary-range activities were centered on C8 and
C12/C14 substrates (Figure 5). Interestingly, many bacterial acyl-ACP TEs, such as those from Desulfovibrio
vulgaris (GenBank:ACL08376, Subfamily E), L. brevis
(GenBank:ABJ63754, Subfamily J), L. plantarum (GenBank:CAD63310, Subfamily J), and Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus (GenBank:CAE80300, no subfamily), are part of
the pathway that produces noticeable amounts of the
methylketone 2-tridecanone through enzymatic hydrolysis of 3-keto-tetradecanoyl-ACP followed by chemical
decarboxylation (data not shown). B. bacteriovorus acylACP TE produced the highest concentration of 2-tridecanone, 9.4 nmol/mL (Figure 6), which was 3 mol% of
the fatty acids produced.
Clustering acyl-ACP TEs based on their catalytic
functionality

To classify acyl-ACP TEs based on their substrate specificities, cluster analysis was performed on the fatty acid
composition data as described in the Experimental Procedures. All acyl-ACP TEs characterized in this study
clustered into three classes: 1) Class I contains acyl-ACP
TEs that mainly act on C14 and C16 substrates; 2) Class
II has acyl-ACP TEs that have broad substrate specificities, with major activities toward C8 and C14 substrates;
and 3) Class III comprises acyl-ACP TEs that predominantly act on C8 substrate (Figure 7). Class I consists of
thirteen plant acyl-ACP TEs from Subfamilies A, B, and
D. Class II contains eleven acyl-ACP TEs, ten from bacteria in Subfamilies E, F, H, I, and J, and a non-grouped
sequence, and only one from a plant (CnFatB3) in Subfamily A. Class III includes seven acyl-ACP TEs, of
which three are from plants in Subfamily A and four are
from bacteria in Subfamilies G and J and a non-grouped
sequence. Considering the previously characterized class

Page 10 of 16

of oleoyl-ACP TEs in Subfamily C, TE14 members may
now be sorted into four classes based on their substrate
specificities.

Discussion
The systematic functional characterization of bacterial
acyl-ACP TEs demonstrates production of SCFAs

Over the past few decades, the number of acyl-ACP TE
sequences in public databases has increased exponentially. The vast majority of these annotations are based
solely on primary sequence homology; most have not
been functionally characterized. The difficulty of purifying protein and preparing substrates precludes a largescale in vitro characterization of acyl-ACP TEs. However, the well-known and widely used approach of analyzing fatty acid concentrations and distributions
produced by heterologous TEs expressed in E. coli K27
provided an efficient and fast way to study the activities
of a large number of diverse acyl-ACP TEs. The integration of phylogeny and prior knowledge of the fatty acid
profiles of the source organisms for these enzymes
allowed us to rationally choose a representative subset
of 31 acyl-ACP TEs to characterize. Significantly, this
study represents the first experimental validation and
functional characterization of bacterial acyl-ACP TEs, 14
of which were studied here.
Seven of these bacterial acyl-ACP TEs, those from
Bacteroides fragilis (GenBank:CAH09236, Subfamily F),
B. thetaiotaomicron (GenBank:AAO77182, Subfamily F),
Clostridium asparagiforme (GenBank:EEG55387, Subfamily H), Bryantella formatexigen (GenBank:EET61113,
Subfamily H), L. brevis (GenBank:ABJ63754, Subfamily
J), L. plantarum (GenBank:CAD63310, Subfamily J), and
Streptococcus dysgalactiae (GenBank:BAH81730, Subfamily J) produced significant amounts of 4:0 and 6:0
fatty acids when expressed in E. coli. This is the first
report of acyl-ACP TEs that have these catalytic activities. Although these enzymes did not appear to show
high activities against C4-ACP and C6-ACP, they provide a good starting point for protein engineering. Both
of these SCFAs could then be potential candidates for
platform biochemicals for a biorenewable chemical
industry [4].
Acyl-ACP TEs from MCFA-producing plant tissues make
MCFAs

Plant tissues known to produce MCFAs were shown
here to contain at least one acyl-ACP TE specific for
medium chain acyl-ACPs. It appears that CnFatB1 (producing primarily 8:0, 14:0, and 16:0 fatty acids), CnFatB2
(making mainly 14:0, 16:0, and 16:1 fatty acids) and
CnFatB3 (producing mostly 8:0, 12:0, 14:0, and 14:1
fatty acids) might work together to determine the fatty
acid composition of coconut oil, which contains

primarily 12:0 (43-50%) and 14:0 (16-22%) and small
amounts of 6:0, 8:0, and 10:0 fatty acids [36-38]. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that other acylACP TEs are also expressed in coconut endosperm, and

that they may be involved in determining the fatty acid
composition of the oil.

vitro enzymatic assays, or in the fatty acid composition of
the organism from which the acyl-ACP TE was sourced,
have been noted previously [1,10,11,13], and could possibly apply to non-plant TEs as well. This phenomenon may
reflect the complexity of the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway within the plant. For example, multiple acyl-ACP TEs
within an organism may contribute to fatty acid composition. Alternatively, the fatty acid profile of an organism
may be determined by the kinetics of the entire fatty acid
biosynthesis pathway, as has been previously proposed
[11,25,44], including the contribution made by the species-specific interactions between the acyl-ACP TE and
the ACP molecule that carries the acyl-substrate for the
acyl-ACP TE. Regardless, this study identifies specific
medium-chain substrates on which the TE can act, which
is especially important for engineering the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway.
Acyl-ACP TEs can intercept both saturated and
unsaturated intermediates of Type II fatty acid synthase
of E. coli

Several plant acyl-ACP TEs (e.g. CnFatB3) produced significant amounts of unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) when

Page 13 of 16

expressed in E. coli. These include 10:1, 12:1, 14:1, and
16:1 fatty acids (Figure 4), which do not usually accumulate in E. coli or in the original host plant tissues
from which the acyl-ACP TE was isolated. A similar
finding has been reported for a U. californica acyl-ACP
TE expressed in E. coli K27 [25]. Although the double
bond position within these fatty acids was not determined in this study, double bonds in UFAs produced in
E. coli K27 expressing a Cinnamonum camphorum acylACP TE were all in cis conformation and at the ω - 7
position [45]. E. coli has a different UFA biosynthesis
pathway than plants. Bacteria, such as E. coli, utilize a
different anaerobic system in which the double bond is
retained in the acyl chain as it is being assembled. Plants
instead use aerobic acyl-ACP desaturase to introduce
double bonds into the acyl chain once it is preformed.
Specifically, the FabA gene in E. coli, encoding 3-hydroxydecanoyl-ACP dehydratase/isomerase, is a bifunctional
enzyme that introduces a double bond at C10 and regulates the branch point of the saturated and unsaturated
pathways [46]. FabB encodes a 3-ketoacyl-ACP synthase
that catalyzes the elongation of cis-3-decenoyl-ACP produced by FabA [46]. Because 10:1-ACP, 12:1-ACP, 14:1ACP, and 16:1-ACP are intermediates of the UFA biosynthesis pathway in E. coli, the UFAs produced by acylACP TEs are most likely derived from those intermediates and thus are in the cis conformation and unsaturated at the ω - 7 position. The accumulation of both
UFAs and saturated fatty acids observed in this study is
consistent with the previous conclusion that the heterologously expressed acyl-ACP TEs can intercept both
saturated and unsaturated intermediates of fatty acid
biosynthesis of E. coli [46].
Subtle changes in primary sequences may be sufficient to
change the substrate specificity of acyl-ACP TEs

The relationship between the structures of acyl-ACP
TEs and their functionalities (i.e. their substrate specificities) is poorly understood. To begin to address this
question, the 31 acyl-ACP TEs that were functionally
characterized herein were clustered using the substrate
specificity data obtained from their in vivo activities
(Figures 4 and 5 and Additional file 12, Table A2).
Comparison between the specificity-based classification
and the sequence-based phylogenetic tree (Figure 1)
indicates that the two classifications are not necessarily
consistent with each other. Three phenomena were
observed in this study. First, diverged sequences (variants in primary structure) from the same species do not
necessarily differ in function. For example, S. bicolor
expresses at least three acyl-ACP TEs in Subfamily A
and two in Subfamily B, all of which share very similar
substrate specificity as measured by the fatty acids produced when expressed in E. coli (Figure 4D). One

Page 14 of 16

possible explanation for the persistence of this number
of acyl-ACP TEs with similar function within a species
genome may be due to divergence in spatial or temporal
expression of their acyl-ACP TEs. Second, similar
sequences may have different substrate specificities, e.g.,
three acyl-ACP TEs from C. viscosissima have different
substrate specificities although their mature protein
sequences share more than 70% primary sequence identity, and they all are classified within Subfamily A.
Third, sequences that belong to different subfamilies
because they share low sequence identity can have very
similar substrate specificities. For example, CnFatB2
(Subfamily A) and S. bicolor (GenBank:EER96252, Subfamily B) acyl-ACP TEs are members of different subfamilies and share only 40% sequence identity, and yet
they have very similar substrate specificities. Therefore,
it is not reasonable to infer the substrate specificity of
one acyl-ACP TE based on its sequence-based classification within the same subfamily. It is conceivable, therefore, that the change of substrate specificity is most
likely caused by changes of only a few amino acid residues, and that many different combinations of residue
changes could result in changed specificities [5]. In previous studies of FatA and FatB TEs, discrete sequence
changes in a region of the putative ACP binding site [7]
or in residues surrounding the catalytic site [47] altered
substrate specificity. These studies were both based on
predicted structures. Identifying the amino acids that
determine substrate specificity is critical for engineering
novel acyl-ACP TEs, but this is limited by the lack of
tertiary structural information of acyl-ACP TEs from
different subfamilies. A comparison of the two PDB
structures known for bacterial acyl-ACP TEs, from B.
thetaiotaomicron (PDB:2ESS, GenBank:AAO77182, Subfamily F) and L. plantarum (PDB:2OWN, GenBank:
CAD63310, Subfamily J), is instructive. Although they
share only 18% sequence identity, these two proteins
share a common HotDog tertiary structure, being coaligned with an RMSD of 2.59 Å (Figure 2). However, B.
thetaiotaomicron acyl-ACP TE has broad substrate specificity, while L. plantarum acyl-ACP TE is specific for
C6 and C8 acyl-ACP substrates. Thus, future work can
focus on identifying and validating the role of specific
residues in determining acyl-ACP TE substrate
specificity.

Methylketones such as 2-tridecanone occur in the wild
tomato species Solanum habrochaites subsp. Glabratum
[48], and their biosynthesis is catalyzed by two sequentially-acting methylketone synthases, MKS1 and MKS2.
MKS2 is a TE that catalyzes the hydrolysis of the 3ketoacyl-ACP intermediate in fatty acid biosynthesis,
and MKS1 catalyzes the decarboxylation of the released
3-keto acid to produce a methylketone [49,50]. Heterologous expression of MKS2 in E. coli yields many
methylketones, including 2-tridecanone [50]. However,
MKS2 is not included in Family TE14, but instead it
belongs to Family TE9 [14]. Although some Family
TE14 members share very low if any significant
sequence similarity (i.e., < 15% identity) to MKS2, the
current study indicates that at least nine acyl-ACP TEs
(e.g. B. bacteriovorus, GenBank:CAE80300) can catalyze
the same reaction as MKS2 (i.e, hydrolysis of the thioester bond of 3-ketoacyl-ACP), and that the resulting
product (3-keto acid) is further chemically or enzymatically decarboxylated to generate the methylketone. The
b
-ketoacyl decarboxylase activity involved in methylketone production in both the fungus Penicillium roqueforti [51] and the bacterium Staphylococcus carnosus
[52] has been described previously. Hence we cannot
rule out the possibility that some b-ketoacyl decarboxylase activity may also exist in E. coli.

Unexpected activity reveals diversity of acyl-ACP TEs

Additional material

Interestingly, in the E. coli heterologous expression system used here, six bacterial-sourced acyl-ACP TEs and
three plant-sourced acyl-ACP TEs produced noticeable
amounts (> 1 nmol/mL) of methylketones, largely 2-tridecanone. The acyl-ACP TE from B. bacteriovorus
(GenBank:CAE80300) produced the highest concentration of 2-tridecanone (9.4 nmol/mL).

Conclusions
This study has revealed that acyl-ACP TEs isolated
from different taxa have considerable functional diversity relative to their substrate specificity. Prior characterizations of plant acyl-ACP TEs have focused on the
substrate specificity relative to acyl chain lengths, to
identify such enzymes for bioengineering a source of
lauric acid for use by the detergent industry. The present study has revealed that bacterial orthologs provide
access to additional functional diversity, both relative
to acyl chain length specificity (e.g., shorter acyl
chains, as short as four carbon atoms), as well as acyl
chains that contain additional chemical functionalities
(e.g., unsaturated acyl chains and acyl chains containing carbonyl groups). This additional functional diversity in acyl-ACP TEs can potentially be used to
diversify the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway to produce
biorenewable chemicals [4].
