Abstract
Background: MicroRNAs are small highly conserved non-coding RNAs which play an important
role in regulating gene expression by binding the 3'UTR of target mRNAs. The majority of
microRNAs are localized within other transcriptional units (host genes) and are co-expressed with
them, which strongly suggests that microRNAs and corresponding host genes use the same
promoter and other expression control elements. The remaining fraction of microRNAs is
intergenic and is endowed with an independent regulatory region. A number of databases have
already been developed to collect information about microRNAs but none of them allow an easy
exploration of microRNA genomic organization across evolution.
Results: CoGemiR is a publicly available microRNA-centered database whose aim is to offer an
overview of the genomic organization of microRNAs and of its extent of conservation during
evolution in different metazoan species. The database collects information on genomic location,
conservation and expression data of both known and newly predicted microRNAs and displays the
data by privileging a comparative point of view. The database also includes a microRNA prediction
pipeline to annotate microRNAs in recently sequenced genomes. This information is easily
accessible via web through a user-friendly query page. The CoGemiR database is available at http:/
/cogemir.tigem.it/
Conclusion: The knowledge of the genomic organization of microRNAs can provide useful
information to understand their biology. In order to have a comparative genomics overview of
microRNAs genomic organization, we developed CoGemiR. To achieve this goal, we both
collected and integrated data from pre-existing databases and generated new ones, such as the
identification in several species of a number of previously unannotated microRNAs. For a more
effective use of this data, we developed a user-friendly web interface that simply shows how a
microRNA genomic context is related in different species.

Background
MicroRNAs are a family of endogenous small non-coding
RNAs with a length of approximately 21–25 nucleotides,
which are usually highly conserved and predicted to regu-

late a large number of transcripts [1]. In the nucleus,
microRNA genes are transcribed into primary transcripts
(pri-microRNA) and then cleaved into shorter precursor
transcripts (pre-microRNA) by the enzyme Drosha and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/457

finally exported to the cytoplasm where they are cleaved
and processed by Dicer to generate mature microRNAs
[2].
Concerning their genomic organization, microRNAs can
be defined as a) intragenic, i.e., located within other transcriptional units (host genes), more frequently in their
intronic regions and more rarely within exonic regions or
b) intergenic. There is evidence that intragenic microRNAs
are co-expressed with the mRNAs of their host genes [3]
and therefore share with them the expression regulation
control. We believe that this observation can be exploited
to shed further light on the mechanisms underlying the
control of microRNA expression.
As a first step towards this goal, we decided to carry out a
genomic comparative analysis of microRNAs in order to
gain more insight into their biology and evolution. A
number of databases have already been developed to collect information about microRNA genomics, sequences
and target genes [4-7]. In particular, some of them allow
the user to obtain some information about the genomic
organization of microRNAs, including information on the
relative position with respect to other transcripts and, in
the case of intragenic microRNAs, on the features of the
corresponding host genes, such as miRBase, miRNAMap,

miRGen and Argonaute (Table 1). However, none of them
provides all of this information simultaneously and in the
context of an evolutionary perspective. For this reason, we
decided to develop a new microRNA-centred database
with a particular focus on the genomic organization of
microRNAs and of its evolutionary conservation in metazoan species.

Results and discussion
Construction and contents
Sequences of the annotated microRNAs were downloaded
from miRBase [8,4], release 10.1, December 2007. The
genome sequences, and corresponding annotation data,
for all the species analyzed were extracted from the
EnsEMBL database (release 48, December 2007) [9]. For
each microRNA, we identified the putative host gene by
querying EnsEMBL using the appropriate Perl object or
running a BLAST analysis. For each intragenic microRNA,
we provide information about: -the relative localization
with respect to all the annotated transcripts of the overlapping gene; -the extent of conservation of the genomic location of microRNAs across evolution; -the gene expression
data for the host gene, extracted from the SymAtlas database (available only for Human and Mouse) [10].

The database includes information on predicted microRNAs, which are either predicted by EnsEMBL, or by a
CoGemiR pipeline based on sequence similarity procedure integrated by secondary structure analysis (Figure S1
Additional file 1). The latter procedure is similar to that
implemented by the web tool miRNAminer [11] and aims
at identifying microRNAs that are not yet annotated in
recently sequenced genomes (see Figure S1 Additional file
1). In comparison to miRNAminer, we extended this analysis to a higher number of species. As a result, we were
able to predict the presence of 188 putative microRNAs in
8 species, which are not currently annotated neither in
miRBase nor in EnsEMBL (Figure S1 Additional file 1 and
Table S1 Additional file 2).
Overall, CoGemiR contains 5064 records – 3970 of which
are annotated in miRBase, 906 are predicted by EnsEMBL
and 188 are predicted by CoGemiR – distributed across 36
species, as shown in Figure 1. Furthermore, we provide
direct links to miRBase and EnsEMBL, direct link to taxonomy information for all the species analyzed and direct

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/457

links, whenever possible, to other relevant database,
including web sites for target prediction.
Utility
The information contained in CoGemiR are both collected from pre-existing databases and newly generated
via a processing pipeline we implemented in order to
determine microRNA genomic organization and conservation across a number of metazoan species.

The database web interface allows verifying whether a
given microRNA is reported to be intragenic or intergenic
in one or more species. For intragenic microRNAs, it is
possible to verify whether or not a particular microRNA is
located within the same gene in different species as well as
to establish whether its position within the host gene
(e.g., exonic, intronic, etc.) is also conserved. In addition,
for most of intragenic microRNAs, we provide both qualitative and quantitative expression information pertaining
to the corresponding overlapping genes. A specific filter
allows the user to restrict the search only to already anno-

tated microRNAs or to those predicted by EnsEMBL and/
or CoGemiR (see next section for further details).
User Interface
The main page briefly summarizes CoGemiR aims, provides some statistics and allows the user to submit a quick
search (Figure 2). There are tree ways to perform a quick
search, i.e., (i) by typing a keyword (e.g., mir-124), (ii) by
pasting a list of microRNAs (max 50) or (iii) by uploading
a file. The query mask allows the user to perform more
complex queries. In the advanced search, all the possible
search options are available. In the main search page, the
query becomes more and more specific in a step-by-step
process, depending on the user's choice. It is possible to
retrieve: (1) a specific microRNA in a selected species; (2)
the list of microRNAs present in a given species or in a set
of species (e.g., all human microRNAs or microRNAs
present in all Primates); (3) the list of the species in which
a selected microRNA or microRNA family is present. In
the latter two cases, the search can also be further
restricted by 1) microRNA 'status', i.e., to allow the user to
retrieve either predicted or annotated microRNAs only; by
2) 'localization', i.e., to allow retrieval of all the microRNAs with a specific localization (intergenic or intragenic
and within the latter category exonic, intronic, etc.); and
by 3) expression data, i.e., to allow retrieval of all the
microRNAs with an overlapping gene expressed in a specific tissue (option available only for human and mouse).
Additional and more complex subqueries are possible by
combining status and localization filters (Figure 3). Parts
of the form appear only if a filter is selected (e.g., the specific localization filter appear only if intragenic microRNAs are selected). Using wildcards (a question mark
immediately after the microRNA name), it is possible to
perform less stringent queries, e.g., by entering the query
"mir-124?" will yield as results both "mir-124" and "mir124a" entries.

The "Results" page contains a summary of the main information about the queried microRNAs (Figure 4). The user
can choose the columns to be visualized. The first column
("MicroRNA") reports the name of the microRNA linked
to the "extra feature" page (see below), the "conservation"
column, which only appears when a single species is
selected in the query, provides a link to the list of species
in which the microRNA is present, the "family" column
provide a link to the list of the microRNAs belonging to
the same family in all species, the "miRBase" column provides a direct link to miRBase whereas the "genomic coordinates" column and the "overlapping gene" column,
which contain the name of the gene overlapping the
microRNA, provide links to EnsEMBL (release 48). The
last three columns indicate the microRNA localization,
the rank of the intron/exon of the gene in which intragenic microRNAs are embedded and the status of the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/457

microRNA, i.e., annotated or predicted. For the CoGemiR
predicted microRNAs, the "status" column provides a link
to the secondary structure prediction data. As shown in
Figure 3, the "Results" page allows to obtain an evolutionary overview of microRNA genomic features. For example,
it is possible to simultaneously assess the genomic localization of a given microRNA in all the analyzed species, as
shown in Figure 4.
Finally, below the "results page" table, there are links for
downloading the sequences of the retrieved microRNAs in
FASTA format and visualizing them in a multiple
sequence alignment format (generated by ClustalW),
which allows the recognition of the nucleotides that have
diverged across evolution in different species. A phylogenetic tree in Phylip format is also provided.
The "Extra features" page, accessible via the "microRNA"
link in the result page collects additional information
(Figure 5), such as the genomic coordinates of both the
microRNA and the overlapping gene, additional information on the genomic region, including the presence of
nearby microRNAs that may be part of a microRNA cluster
and/or additional overlapping transcribed sequences
(e.g., ESTs), the sequences of both the precursor and
mature forms of microRNAs, microarray expression data
of the overlapping gene (extracted from SymAtlas [12])
and links to other external databases. Please note also that
all query results can be downloaded by the user.
Comparison and improvement on similar existent
database
The main difference between CoGemiR and already available resources [4-7], is represented by the evolutionary
perspective of data presentation. Other already available
microRNA databases already contain information on
microRNA genomic data and evolutionary conservation
but none of them allows the simultaneous and systematic
retrieval of these data for each microRNA. These features
render CoGemiR a valuable resource to gain insight into
the evolution of the genomic organization of microRNAs.
For instance, the use of CoGemiR allows to assess that the
genomic organization of miR-25 is likely to be highly conserved across evolution, Figure 4A shows that this microRNA is intragenic and is localized within the same host
gene, MCM7, in all species analyzed, with the possible
exception of Xenopus tropicalis. On the other hand, it is
possible to identify an intriguing difference in the
genomic organization of miR-585, a microRNA so far
identified only in human and in chimp. This microRNA is
localized within the SLIT3 gene in both species but in different orientations, being transcribed in opposite orientation with respect to SLIT3 in chimp and in the same
orientation in human (Figure 4B). Since it was suggested
that an intragenic microRNA and the corresponding host-

ing transcriptional unit share both expression profiles and
expression control elements when they are transcribed in
the same direction [3], this difference may imply a significant difference in the regulation of expression of miR-585
between human and chimp. Obviously, the verification of
this hypothesis requires further investigation.
Moreover, similar to miRNAMiner [11], CoGemiR allows
to perform an automatic annotation of newly sequenced
genomes for microRNAs. However, compared to miRNAMiner, we extended the latter analysis to a higher
number of species.
Table 1 summarizes the main features of CoGemiR in
comparison with other available resources.

Conclusion
MicroRNAs are small molecules, which play a crucial role
in gene regulation. Several functional genomics efforts are
currently in progress to help deciphering their function in
basic biological processes. We believe that a detailed

knowledge of the relationship between microRNA and
their genomic environment provides extremely valuable
information towards a better understanding of their functional role. Towards this goal, we developed CoGemiR, a
database that allows an effective retrieval of microRNA
genomic data and of their extent of conservation across
evolution.
Compared to other preexisting databases, CoGemiR is
more "user-friendly" and contains significant elements of
novelty (see Table 1). We plan to improve our tool including the possibility of searching the database by sequence.

Methods
The dataset is stored in a relational form using MySQL
4.1.14, whereas all the necessary scripts to store and query
the database were written in Perl v5.8.8 (built for i686linux) object-oriented scripting language, making use of
two non-standard libraries, EnsEMBL Perl, [13] and BioPerl [14]. The web interface was written using Perl CGI
library.
