Abstract
Background: Network analyses of plant-animal interactions hold valuable biological information.
They are often used to quantify the degree of specialization between partners, but usually based on
qualitative indices such as 'connectance' or number of links. These measures ignore interaction
frequencies or sampling intensity, and strongly depend on network size.
Results: Here we introduce two quantitative indices using interaction frequencies to describe the
degree of specialization, based on information theory. The first measure (d') describes the degree
of interaction specialization at the species level, while the second measure (H2') characterizes the
degree of specialization or partitioning among two parties in the entire network. Both indices are
mathematically related and derived from Shannon entropy. The species-level index d' can be used
to analyze variation within networks, while H2' as a network-level index is useful for comparisons
across different interaction webs. Analyses of two published pollinator networks identified
differences and features that have not been detected with previous approaches. For instance, plants
and pollinators within a network differed in their average degree of specialization (weighted mean
d'), and the correlation between specialization of pollinators and their relative abundance also
differed between the webs. Rarefied sampling effort in both networks and null model simulations
suggest that H2' is not affected by network size or sampling intensity.
Conclusion: Quantitative analyses reflect properties of interaction networks more appropriately
than previous qualitative attempts, and are robust against variation in sampling intensity, network
size and symmetry. These measures will improve our understanding of patterns of specialization
within and across networks from a broad spectrum of biological interactions.

Background
The degree of specialization of plants or animals has been
studied and debated extensively, and a continuum from
complete specialization to full generalization can be
found in various systems [1-6]. In general, two levels of
specialization measures may be distinguished: first, the
characterization of focal species and, second, the degree of

specialization of an entire interaction network, representing an assemblage of species and their interaction partners
(e.g. food webs, mutualistic networks, predator-prey relationships). When interactions are considered as ecological
niche, the first level describes the niche breadth of a species and the second level the degree of niche partitioning
across species. While the species level is more straightforPage 1 of 12

ward in its biological interpretation, analyses at the network level can be useful for comparisons across different
types of networks. Such analyses have been performed to
compare plant-pollinator webs versus plant-seed disperser webs [4,5], different plant-pollinator networks
along geographic gradients [1,7,8], or food webs of variable size [9,10]. Entire network analyses are also used to
study patterns on a community level such as coevolutionary adaptations [3], ecosystem stability or resilience [1114].
Quantifying specialization at the species level
Specialization or generalization of interactions are most
commonly characterized as the number of partners (or
'links'), e.g. the number of pollinator species visiting a
flowering plant species or the number of food plant families a herbivore feeds upon. In this qualitative approach,
interactions between a consumer and a resource species
are only scored in a binary way as 'present' or 'absent',
ignoring any distinction between strong interactions and
weak or occasional ones. For example, binary representation of interactions do not distinguish a scenario where
99% of the individuals of a herbivore species feed on a
single plant species only, but occasionally an individual is
found on another plant, from a different scenario where a
herbivore regularly feeds on both food plants. The problem is analogous to the measurement of biodiversity
either as a crude species richness versus as a more elaborate diversity index including relative abundances [15].
Several approaches have thus been used to directly
include variation in interaction frequencies (i.e., their
evenness) in characterizing the diversity of partners, e.g.
Simpson's diversity index for pollinators [16,17] or
Lloyd's index for host specificity [18]. Alternatively, other
studies indirectly controlled for abundance or sampling
intensity using rarefaction methods [13,19]. Correspondingly, Bersier and coworkers [20] have suggested to quantify the diversity of biomass flows in food webs using a
Shannon diversity measure. Niche breadth theory provides several additional indices that include some measure of resource frequency or resource use intensity [21],
which can be viewed in analogy to 'partner diversity' in
the context of association networks. However, Hurlbert
[22] emphasized that not only proportional utilization,
but also the proportional availability of each niche should
be taken into account. A species that uses all niches in the
same proportion as their availability in the environment
should be considered more opportunistic than a species
that uses rare resources disproportionately more. If variation in resource availability is large, diversity-based measures that ignore this availability may be highly misleading
[22,23]. Several niche breadth measures thus combine
proportional resource utilization with proportional
resource availability [22-24]. These concepts have been
rarely applied in the context of species interaction net-

works, e.g. plant-pollinator webs where binary data are
more common than quantitative webs.
Quantifying specialization at the community level
The measurement used most commonly to characterize
community-wide specialization is the 'connectance' index
(C) [1,4,8-10, 25-27]. C is defined as the proportion of the
actually observed interactions to all possible interactions.
Consider a contingency table showing the association
between two parties, with r rows (e.g., plant species) and
c columns (e.g., pollinators). Connectance is defined as C
= I/(r·c), with I being the total number of non-zero elements in the matrix. Therefore, like the number of partners or links (L) described above, C uses only binary information and ignores interaction strength. C is directly

related to the mean number of links ( L ) of plant species
or pollinator species as C = L

plants/c

= L

poll/r.

This measure, L , has also been used to compare networks
[1,3,7,8,28]. Recently, it has been suggested to use L
instead of C to characterize networks [29]. However, note
that comparisons across networks of different size
(number of species) are problematic, since L , unlike C, is
not scaled according to the number of available partners
(see also [2,10]). L in a small network may represent a
larger proportion of available partners compared to the
same value of L in a large network.
Analyses based on binary data – both at the species and
the community level – have obvious shortcomings, since
they are highly dependent on sampling effort, decisions
which species to include or not, and the size of investigated networks. Several authors thus emphasized the need
to move beyond binary representations of interactions to
quantitative measures involving some measure of interaction strength [4,20,27,29-32]. A way to at least partly overcome these deficiencies is to cut off all rare species or weak
interactions below a frequency threshold [3,9,33,34] or to
control for sampling effort in null models
[7,8,13,19,25,35]. However, for interaction webs where a
more detailed information is available, simplification to
binary data as in C or L remains unsatisfactory. Conveniently, the observed interaction frequency may represent a
meaningful surrogate for interaction strength, at least in
pollination and seed-dispersal systems as shown by
Vázquez et al. [30] (see also [16]). Incorporating interaction frequency or even a direct measure of interaction

strength in a network measure of specialization would
thus provide an important progress frequently called for.
A severe additional problem of connectance is that its
lower and upper constraints are not scale-invariant [25],
which limits its use for comparisons across networks. The
minimum possible value (Cmin) to maintain at least one
link per species declines in a hyperbolic function with the
number of interacting species, since Cmin = max(r, c)/(r·c),
and an upper limit (Cmax) may be constrained by, or a
function of, total sampling effort. Across networks, C
decays strongly with network size, which has been
debated in detail in the context of food web analysis
[9,10,26,27,36,37]. The strong relationship between C
and network size generates a problem for disentangling
any biologically meaningful effect from this mathematically inherent scale dependence. For instance, network
comparisons may focus on residual variation in C after an
average effect of network size has been controlled for
[1,4], or C could be rescaled to account for this size effect
(see [25,36]). For natural networks of similar size, the
range of actual C values is typically very narrow [4], thus
other structural forces may be poorly detectable.
The objective of this paper is to develop and discuss specialization measures that are based on frequency data and
thus account for sampling intensity, and that overcome
the problem of scale dependence. We then test these
approaches by evaluating the effect of sampling effort and
scale dependence on a published natural pollination network, and on randomly generated associations as a null
model. We differentiate between species-level measures of
specialization, useful to investigate variability among species within a web, and a single network-wide measure that
can be used for comparisons across networks.

Results
Patterns in two pollinator networks
Two selected plant-pollinator networks (British meadows
studied by Memmott [32], Argentinean forests studied by
Vázquez and Simberloff [33]) differ markedly in their
degree of specialization when quantitative analyses are
applied. The qualitative network index, connectance, is
similar in both interaction webs (British web: C = 0.15,
Argentinean web: C = 0.13). However, frequencies of pollinator visits are much more evenly distributed in the British community than in the Argentinean example. In the
British web, the interaction between a dipteran species
and Leontodon hispidus was the most frequent one, representing 6% of the total 2183 interactions observed. In the
Argentinean network, visits of Aristotelia chilensis by a colletid bee species represented 20% of the 5285 interactions
alone. Interactions between the top five plant and top five
pollinator species made up 44% of the interactions in the
British web, but 74% in the Argentinean web. This differ-

ence in the heterogeneity of interaction frequencies is not
evident in measures based on binary information such as
number of links (L) or connectance (C). In contrast, the
degree of specialization shown by the frequency-based
index H2' (standardized two-dimensional Shannon
entropy, see Methods: Network-level index) is much lower in
the British community (H2' = 0.24) compared to the
Argentinean community (H2' = 0.63).
The variation of species-level specialization measures
(standardized Kullback-Leibler distance, d') holds valuable information for the structural properties of a network
(see Methods: Species-level index). The British pollination
web is dominated by highly generalized pollinators (low
d', both in terms of individuals as well as species), while
putative specialists are represented by very few individuals
and species (Fig. 1A). In contrast, most pollinators in the
Argentinean web are moderately generalized to specialized, with the second highest level of specialization found
in the most common species (Fig. 1B). Consequently, the
weighted mean degree of specialization is much lower in
the former web (<d'poll> = 0.16) than in the latter (<d'poll>
= 0.54). The relationship between specialization of species i (d'i) and its interaction frequency (Ai) across the pollinator species differs between the two webs. In the British
web, d'i and Ai were not correlated significantly (Spearman's rs = -0.08, p = 0.46), while a highly positive correlation was found in the Argentinean web (rs = 0.65, p <
0.0001). Note that designation of any specialization index
to a species i that is only represented by a single individual
may be critical. However, significances in the above correlations remain unaffected when pollinators with one single interaction are excluded. From the plants' point of
view, the species in Memmott's web are also more generalized in terms of their pollinator spectrum (Fig. 1C) than
the plants studied by Vázquez and Simberloff (Fig. 1D).
The respective weighted means are <d'plants> = 0.27 and
<d'plants> = 0.53. No significant correlation was found
between the plants' frequency and specialization in either
web (both p ≥ 0.16). Interestingly, plants were on average
more specialized than pollinators in the British web
(<d'plants> > <d'poll.>), but not in the Argentinean web. This
distinction is not found when only the weighted mean
number of links (L) are examined, since <Lplants> is much
greater than <Lpoll.> in both networks. The difference in
<L> may be driven by the highly asymmetrical matrix
architecture in both webs, where the number of pollinator
species greatly exceeds the number of plant species. The
unweighted mean L is even directly linked to the matrix

architecture (i.e., number of rows and columns, r and c)
by a constant (connectance C), since L r = c·C and L c =
r·C. In contrast, the matrix asymmetry does not affect d'
(see also below, Null model patterns).
Simulation of sampling effort
In order to test whether specialization estimates are
dependent on sampling and scale effects, we simulated a
decreased sampling intensity in both networks using rarefaction (see Methods: Simulation of sampling effort and
matrix architecture). In both networks, H2' is robust and
already very well estimated by a small fraction of the interactions sampled (Fig. 2). The coefficient of variance of H2'
remains below 5% from about half of the total number of
visits onwards in the British web and even at one-tenth of
the total sampling effort of the Argentinean web. The estimation of connectance (C) is also relatively stable at least
in the Argentinean web, although it shows a positive trend
across sampling effort in the British web (Fig. 2). These
findings suggest that network-wide measures of speciali-

zation, particularly H2', do not necessarily require a very
large or even complete association matrix, but can also be
very well estimated from a smaller representative subset as
long as there is no systematic sampling bias.
Null model patterns
The degree of specialization can be further characterized
by comparison with a null model. The null model used
here is that each species has a fixed total number of interactions (given by the observed association matrix), but
interactions are assigned randomly. In the above pollinator networks, random associations yield a specialization
index H2' that remains close to zero for almost the entire
range of sampling intensity, while connectance (C) shows
a positive trend over the total number of interactions (m)
(Fig. 2). Therefore, H2' derived from real networks may
typically be clearly distinguished from this null model,
while the comparison of C is complicated by scale
dependence and the relatively large values yielded by the
null model.

Sampling effect in pollinator networks
Sampling effect in pollinator networks. Rarefaction of sampling effort in a British and an Argentinean pollination web
[32,33]. Two network-level measures of specialization – the frequency-based specialization index (H2') and the 'connectance'
index (C) – are shown for networks in which the total number of interactions (m) has been reduced by randomly deleting
interactions. Black dots show the effect of sampling effort for the original association matrix, gray dots the effect for a null
model, i.e. five networks in which partners were randomly associated (same row and column totals as in the original matrix).
Simulations of artificially generated random associations
(see Methods: Simulation of sampling effort and matrix architecture) confirm that the network-level specialization
index H2' is largely unaffected by network size (Fig. 3A),
network architecture (Fig. 3B) or total number of interactions (m) for a fixed matrix size (Fig. 3C). For random
associations as shown here, H2' is usually close to zero.
Connectance values (C) of random matrices show the
known hyperbolic function over the number of associated
species (Fig. 3A), changes with matrix asymmetry (Fig.
3B) and increase strongly with increasing m (Fig. 3C). For
specialization measures at the species level, the average
number of links per species ( L ) increases strongly with
network size, number of available partners, and m (Fig. 3).

While other niche breadth measures may also show some
variation across different network scales (not shown), the
weighted mean Kullback-Leibler distance <d'> is poorly
affected by network size, network asymmetry, and
number of interactions (Fig. 3). Both H2' and d' may thus
be appropriate for comparisons across matrices of different scale.

Discussion
Properties of specialization measures
The suggested indices, d' and H2', quantify the degree of
specialisation of elements within an interaction network
and of the entire network, respectively. While the number
of links (L) and connectance (C) represent species-level
and community-level measures of interactions based on

binary data, respectively, d' and H2' represent corresponding measures for frequency-based data. The need to
include information on interaction strength or interaction
frequency into network analyses has been announced by
various authors [4,20,27,30,31,38]. Parallel to earlier
advances in diversity measures compared to species richness, quantitative network measures account for the heter-

ogeneity in link strength rather than assigning equal
weights to every link. Moreover, we have shown that d'
and H2' are largely robust against variation in matrix size,
shape, and sampling effort. In several cases, C may be
strongly affected by sampling effort [25,27], while H2'
remained largely unchanged in simulations of random
associations over a range of network sizes, variable net-

work asymmetries, and number of interactions. This scale
invariance suggests that both d' and H2' can be used
directly for comparisons across different networks, while
comparisons of L and C are more problematic [1,35].
Qualitative methods like the indices suggested here also
allow a more detailed analysis of interaction patterns
within and across networks. Fruitful areas include comparisons of networks across different interaction types [4],
biogeographical gradients [1], biodiversity and land use
gradients [13], robustness of networks against extinction
risks [39], asymmetries between plants and animals [38],
and relationships between specialisation and abundance
[35]. While a comparison of the average number of partners between plants versus animals is solely dependent on
the matrix architecture (i.e., the number of rows r versus
columns c, since L

plants =

c·C and L

poll =

r·C), this limita-

tion does not apply to d'. In the two selected pollinator
webs, plants are either similarly or more specialised than
pollinators in regard to weighted mean d'. This allows an
scale-independent evaluation of asymmetries in the
degree of specialization between partners (see also [38]).
Moreover, Vázquez and Aizen [35] noted that the number
of links of a species (Li) is strongly positively correlated
with its overall frequency (Ai) in five pollination networks
including the datasets analyzed above. They argued that
this apparent higher generalization of common plants
and common pollinators may be largely explained by null
models, calling for an improved measurement of specialization. Our results for the correlation between d'i and Ai
in two pollinator webs suggest that the relationship
between specialization and abundance may be more variable, and even positive as in the Argentinean network.
Caveats
Some problems apply to any measure of network analyses
including the proposed indices. Measures of specialization mostly ignore phylogenetic relationships or ecological similarity within an association matrix. For example, a
plant species that is pollinated by multiple moth species
may be unsuitably regarded as more generalized than a
plant pollinated by few insect species comprising several
different orders [40]. In addition, the fact that herbivores
are commonly specialized on host plant families rather
than species may skew network patterns if not carefully
accounted for. A first approach to investigate such effects
may be to compare the level of specialization after a stepwise reduction of the matrix by pooling species to higher
taxonomic units, such as genera, families, and orders. For
known phylogenies, more advanced techniques for analyses with a particular evolutionary focus are available [41-

43]. Another deficiency may be that species or their partners are all given the same individual 'weight' in the analyses, whether they may be small bees or large bats visiting
a small herb with little nectar or a mass flowering tree.
Null models as in the calculation for both C and H2.'
imply that all individuals can be shifted around between
resources in the same way, irrespective of their size or
non-fitting parameters. The role of 'forbidden links' as
constraints to network analyses has been discussed elsewhere [44,45]. Similarly, calculations of d' or other niche
breadth measures are based on the implicit assumption
that each species adjusts its interactions according to the
availability of partners (niches), irrespective of morphological or behavioral constraints. Moreover, if data are collected from a large heterogeneous habitat or over a
prolonged time period, calculations of the degree of specialization may be severely constrained by the spatiotemporal overlap or non-overlap between partners for other
reasons than resource preferences, e.g. when not all species are able to reach all sites in the same way, or when
some resources and consumers have asynchronous phenologies. Consequently, network analyses as suggested
here will be most useful to study resource-consumer partitioning within a short time frame and limited spatial
scale.
For both indices d' and H2', we proposed above to use the
total number of interactions for each species as a measure
of partner availability (qj) and as constraint for standardization (fixed row and column totals). It may be debated
whether independent measures of plant and animal abundances could be more appropriate than using interaction
frequency data as such. However, despite the fact that such
abundance data barely exist for most networks, note that
the actual number of interactions often more suitably
reflects resource availability and consumer activity than
an independent measure of species abundance. For
instance, a flower of one species may have a much higher
nectar production than another and consequently receive
a higher number of visitors, while the local abundance of
the plant species does not reflect such differences in
resource quality and/or quantity. Both d' and H2' thus
focus on the actual partitioning between the interacting
species. In studies where detailed knowledge or theoretical assumptions about resources (availability and quality)
or consumers (activity density and consumption rate) are
available or under experimental control, such data may be
incorporated into the analysis (defining qj and constraints) instead of interaction frequencies. The constraint
of fixed row and column totals has been debated elsewhere in the context of species co-occurrence patterns,
where it was found to be most appropriate in null model
comparisons, although critics have argued earlier that
these marginals themselves may already reflect competitive interactions ([46] and references therein). Any

approach to compare networks based on fixed marginals
for standardization will fail to detect potentially meaningful patterns displayed by these architectural features,
namely the number of resource and consumer species and
the heterogeneity of total interaction frequencies. This
network architecture may already be shaped by past competitive interactions or indicate fundamental constraints,
a largely unexplored hypothesis that merits additional
investigations.
It should also be emphasized that analyses of frequency
data may be susceptible for pseudoreplication of repeated
associations of the same individuals or close associations
derived from a single dispersal event (e.g. a social insect
colony, aggregating individuals, multiple offspring from a
single egg cluster, or monospecific plant clusters). These
may lead to an overestimation of specialization. To be
more meaningful on a population level, frequency analyses should thus be based on spatially independent association replicates. Note that all species-wise specialization
measures such as d' are sensitive to the behavior of the
other species. Any systematic sampling bias (e.g. a taxonomic focus within a guild) will therefore affect the conclusions of comparisons within or across networks.

Methods
Species-level index
As species-level measure of 'partner diversity', we propose
the Kullback-Leibler distance (or Kullback-Leibler divergence, relative entropy) in a standardized form (d'). Coming from information theory, this index quantifies the
difference between two probability distributions [48].
While the standardized Hurlbert's and Smith's measure of
niche breadth could be used alternatively [21,22,24], d'
has some advantages in the context of networks. While all
three indices regard an exclusive pairing between two species as high degree of specialization as long as interactions
between the two partners are infrequent, Hurlbert's and
Smith's indices show a undesired trend towards full generalization when the number of interactions between the
two partners increase, although this should be considered
a stronger indication of specialization (see below, Properties of alternative niche breadth measures). The interaction
between two parties is commonly displayed in a r × c contingency table, with r rows representing one party such as
flowering plant species, and c columns representing the
other party such as pollinator species. In each cell, the frequency of interaction between plant species i and pollinator species j (or another useful measure of interaction
strength) is given as aij, (Table 1).

Conclusion
In accordance with previous calls [4,20,27,30,31,38], we
suggest that the explicit inclusion of frequency data
reflects an important step forward in network analyses, as
too many assumptions are implicit in any measure based
on binary representation. Most notably, connectance and
'number of partners' imply an equal availability of all
partners – an unlikely scenario. Qualitative indices are not
robust against sampling effort. On the contrary, the proposed quantitative measures based on interaction frequencies explicitly account for this source of variation.
Our study suggests that d' and H2' represent scale-independent and meaningful indices to characterize specialization on the level of single species and the entire
network, respectively. These novel indices allow us to
investigate patterns within and across networks that have
not been detected with qualitative measures such as correlations with species frequencies, network size and asymmetries in specialization between partners. Recently,
Bascompte et al. [38] showed that the incorporation of
frequency data may unveil pervasive asymmetries within
networks. Particularly since Vázquez et al. [30] demonstrated that interaction frequencies in plant-pollinator
and plant-seed disperser systems often correlate with the
magnitude of mutualistic services for the plant (although
variation in pollinator effectiveness can be important, see
[47]), an increased collection of frequency data and
appropriate quantitative analyses would greatly benefit
future network studies.

Instead of frequencies (aij), each interaction can be
assigned a proportion of the total (m) as

pij = aij / m , where

r

∑ ∑ pij

=1.

i =1 j =1

Let p'ij be the proportion of the number of interactions
(aij) in relation to the respective row total (Ai), and qj the
proportion of all interactions by partner j in relation to
the total number of interactions (m). Thus,

pij = aij / Ai ,

To quantify the specialization of a species i, the following
index di is suggested. This di is related to Shannon diversity, similar to an index recently suggested to characterize
biomass flow diversity in food webs [20]. However, an
appropriate index in this context should not only consider
the diversity of partners, but also their respective availability (see [22]). Consequently, the following index compares the distribution of the interactions with each partner
(p'j) to the overall partner availability (qj). The KullbackLeibler distance for species i is denoted as

di − dmin
.
dmax − dmin

The theoretical maximum is given by dmax = ln (m/Ai), and
the theoretical minimum (dmin) is zero for the special case
where all p'ij = qj. However, a realistic dmin may be constrained at some value above zero given that p'ij and qj are
calculated from discrete integer values (aij). To take this
into account, dmin is more suitably computed algorithmically as in a program available from the authors and
online [49], providing all d' for a given matrix. This standardized Kullback-Leibler distance (d') ranges from 0 for
the most generalized to 1.0 for the most specialized case.
Thus, d' can be interpreted as deviation of the actual interaction frequencies from a null model which assumes that
all partners are used in proportion to their availability. An
average degree of specialization among the species of a
party can be presented as a weighted mean of the standardized index, e.g. <d'i> for pollinators as

which can be normalized as

Network-level index
The following network-wide measure is based on the
bipartite representation of a two mode network of interactions such as plant-animal or other resource-consumer
interactions where members of each party interact with
members of the other party but not among themselves
(unlike many food webs). The two-dimensional Shannon
entropy (termed H2 in order to avoid confusion with the
common one-dimensional H) is obtained as
r

c

H2 = −∑ ∑ ( pij ⋅ ln pij ).
i =1 j =1

H2 decreases with higher specialization. This measure is
closely related to the weighted mean of the non-standardized Kullback-Leibler distance of all species, since
<di> = <dj> = H2max - H2
(see below, Relationship between di and H2). H2 can be
standardized between 0 and 1.0 for extreme specialization
versus extreme generalization, respectively, when its minimum and maximum values (H2min and H2max) are
known. H2min and H2max can be calculated for given constraints. The constraints used here are the maintenance of
the total number of interactions of each species, thus all
row and column totals, Ai and Aj, being fixed (see also
[46]). Alternative constraints may be defined depending
on the knowledge of the system studied.
H2 reaches its theoretical maximum where each pij equals
its expected value from a random interaction matrix
(qi·qj), such that

The weighted mean of di for all i rows (each row weighted
by qi) yields

c

H2 max = −∑ ∑ ( qi q j ⋅ ln qi q j ),
i =1 j =1

while its theoretical minimum (H2min) may be close to
zero depending on the matrix architecture. Like for dmin
above, H2max and H2min are constrained by the fact that
they are derived from integer values. A program implementing a heuristic solution to obtain H2max and H2min,
and to perform the entire analysis is available from the
authors or online [49].
The degree of specialization is obtained as a standardized
entropy on a scale between H2min and H2max as

H2 max − H2
′
.
H2 =
H2 max − H2 min
Consequently, H2' ranges between 0 and 1.0 for extreme
generalization and specialization, respectively.

Comparison with random associations
H2 can be tested against a null model of random associations (H2ran). A number of random permutations of the
matrix can be performed using a r × c randomization algorithm (also available at [49]). The probability (p-value)
that the observed H2 is more specialized than expected by
random associations is simply given as the proportion of
values obtained for H2ran that are equal or larger than H2,
a common procedure in randomization statistics [25,50].
H2ran is usually only slightly larger than H2min.Previously,
permutations of r × c contingency tables often used a different test statistics instead of H2 [25,51,52]:

= −∑ ( qi ⋅ ln qi ) − ∑ ( q j ⋅ ln q j ).

Therefore,
<di> = H2max -H2.
The same calculation applies for <dj>, thus <di> = <dj>.
Consequently, the degree of specialization of the entire
network (corresponding to the deviation of the networkwide entropy from its maximum value) equals the
weighted sum of the specialization of its elements (species).
Properties of alternative niche breadth measures
The standardized Hurlbert's (B') and Smith's (FT) measure can be applied widely for niche breadth analysis
[21,22,24]. In this context, the Kullback-Leibler distance
(d) can be viewed as a modified Shannon-Wiener measure
of niche breadth that accounts for niche availabilities.
Like the Kullback-Leibler distance, both B' and FT compare the proportional distribution of individuals (p) to
the proportional resource availability (q) (here: partner
availability). For a certain species i, the two measures are
in our notation:
B − qmin

Each p'ij is the proportion of the number of interactions in
relation to the respective row total, and qj is the propor-

Both the standardized Hurlbert's (B') and Smith's (FT)
measure range between 0 for the most specialized case to
1.0 for extreme generalization (broadest niche). In the
context of niche breadth, it has been shown that the Shannon-Wiener measure is most sensitive, while Hurlbert's
and particularly Smith's measure are less sensitive for the
selection of rare resources [21] (see also [20]).
For the application in network analyses, however, both B'
and FT may show some undesired properties. Generally,
B', FT and d' are reasonably well correlated with each
other across the species within a network (e.g., rs = -0.49
between d' and B', and rs = -0.36 between d' and FT for the
90 pollinators in the network of Vázquez and Simberloff
[33], both p < 0.001). However, differences with d' are
substantial when a highly specialized species interacts
largely exclusively with a specialized partner, e.g. a specialized pollinator with a plant that is almost exclusively
pollinated by this one. Imagine a scenario where one
exclusive interaction occurs between a plant species and a
pollinator species in a 3 × 3 matrix (Table 2). If the interaction between pollinator sp. 3 and plant sp. 3 is only
infrequent (e.g. a33 = 1), all indices show a high degree of
specialization (d' = 1.0, B' = 0, FT = 0.14) for both partners. However, as the number of exclusive interactions
(a33) increases, the values for both B' and FT of pollinator
sp. 3 and plant sp. 3 show a highly undesired change
towards generalization, although a higher a33 is intuitively
considered as extreme specialization (e.g., for a33 = 50 the
values for pollinator sp. 3 are B' = 0.31 and FT = 0.70),
while only d' remains unaffected (d' = 1.0). FT is always
larger than zero, and B' becomes larger than zero when the
specialists interact more frequently than one of the other
partners, thus when qj > min(q1, q2, ... qc). Both FT and B'
approach a value of 1.0 (maximum generalization) for
very large a33. This undesired effect of FT and B' is not
restricted to completely exclusive interactions between
two partners.

Simulation of sampling effort and matrix architecture
Two published plant-pollinator networks were selected to
investigate the behavior of different specialization measures [32,33]. Both articles use their observed interaction
matrices as a model to discuss network properties based
on the number of links per pollinator or plant species,
allowing a comparison of conclusions drawn. Both networks may be compared as they comprise relatively large
datasets from temperate ecosystems, reporting interaction
frequencies between plants and their floral visitors: the
British meadow community studied by Memmott [32]
involved 79 pollinator and 25 plant species (2183 pollinator visits observed), the forests in Argentina studied by
Vázquez and Simberloff [33] involved 90 pollinator and
14 plant species (5285 visits). The datasets can be
obtained from the Interaction Web Database [53]. We
simulated a decreased sampling intensity in both networks using a rarefaction method in order to investigate
how sampling effort affects the estimation of specialization indices. Real association matrices were reduced by
randomly extracting interactions, e.g. from the total of m
= 2183 visits in Memmott's web down to m = 5 visits (in
steps of five, repeated ten times for each m).

In order to compare the null model characteristics of the
specialization measures, we simulated artificial matrices
with randomly associated partners and plotted the indices
against an increasing number of partners and/or total
number of interactions. We assumed that the total frequency of participating species approximates a lognormal
distribution, which is typical for biological communities
[21,22,24]. All row and column totals were randomly generated from a lognormal distribution (μ = 50, ∑= 1) that
was scaled to the desired total number of interactions. Ten
different combinations of row and column totals were
obtained for each matrix size and taken as template to randomly associate the partners five times, thus each matrix
size was represented by 50 random associations.
