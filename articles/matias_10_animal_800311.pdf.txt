channels appear to be homologous to and derived
from the ubiquitous cation diffusion facilitators

Abstract
Background: Antigen stimulation of immune cells triggers Ca2+ entry through Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC)
channels, promoting an immune response to pathogens. Defects in a CRAC (Orai) channel in humans gives rise to the
hereditary Severe Combined Immune Deficiency (SCID) syndrome. We here report results that define the evolutionary
relationship of the CRAC channel proteins of animals, and the ubiquitous Cation Diffusion Facilitator (CDF) carrier
proteins.
Findings: CDF antiporters derived from a primordial 2 transmembrane spanner (TMS) hairpin structure by intragenic
triplication to yield 6 TMS proteins. Four programs (IC/GAP, GGSEARCH, HMMER and SAM) were evaluated for
identifying sequence similarity and establishing homology using statistical means. Overall, the order of sensitivity
(similarity detection) was IC/GAP = GGSEARCH > HMMER > SAM, but the use of all four programs was superior to the
use of any two or three of them. Members of the CDF family appeared to be homologous to members of the 4 TMS
Orai channel proteins.
Conclusions: CRAC channels derived from CDF carriers by loss of the first two TMSs of the latter. Based on statistical
analyses with multiple programs, TMSs 3-6 in CDF carriers are homologous to TMSs 1-4 in CRAC channels, and the
former was the precursor of the latter. This is an unusual example of how a functionally and structurally more complex
protein may have predated a simpler one.
Background
Antigen stimulation of immune cells triggers Ca2+ entry
through Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels,
promoting an immune response to pathogens [1]. Cells
from patients with one form of the hereditary Severe
Combined Immune Deficiency (SCID) syndrome are
defective in Store-Operated Ca2+ (SOC) entry and CRAC
channel function [2]. The genetic defect in these patients
appears to be in a protein called Orai1, which contains
four putative transmembrane segments (TMSs) [3]. SCID
patients are homozygous for a single missense mutation
in Orai1 (TC# 1.A.52.1.1), and expression of wild-type
Orai1 in SCID T cells restores SOC influx and the CRAC
current. Orai1 is an essential component of the CRAC
channel complex [4,5].

Human Orai1 has homologues in all animals with
sequenced genomes, and these channel proteins have
been identified largely in animals. They interact with
Stromal Interaction Molecule 1 (STIM1) to form the
functional channel complex [5-8]. One study concluded
that Orai1 forms a homotetramer [9]. Coupling of STIM1
to SOC entry depends on its movement in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [10].
Orai1 and TRPC1 are core components of CRAC and
SOC channels, respectively [3,11]. Mutations of acidic
residues in TMSs 1 and 3 and in the I-II loop of Orai1
decrease Ca2+ flux and increase Cs+ flux [12]. STIM1, a
Ca2+-sensor of luminal Ca2+ content in the ER, interacts
with and mediates store-dependent regulation of both
channels. TRPC1+ Stim1-dependent SOC requires functional Orai1 [13]. Stim1 triggers activation of CRAC
channels in the surface membrane after Ca2+ store depletion [11,14].

Although CRAC channels have been characterized only
from animals, homologues may be present in unicellular
eukaryotes such as the choanoflagellates [15]. A limited
distribution in eukaryotes is implied. However, CDF antiporters are ubiquitous, being found in profusion in bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes [16]. They transport heavy
metals including cobalt, cadmium, zinc and possibly
nickel, copper and mercuric ions. There are 10 mammalian CDF paralogues [17].
Most members of the CDF family possess six putative
transmembrane spanners with N- and C-termini on the
cytoplasmic side of the membrane [18]. These proteins
exhibit an unusual degree of sequence divergence and
size variation (300-750 residues), and eukaryotic proteins
exhibit differences in cell localization. Some (e.g., ZnT27) catalyze heavy metal uptake from the cytoplasm into
various intracellular organelles while others (e.g., ZnT1)
catalyze efflux from the cytoplasm across the plasma
membrane into the extracellular medium [19-21].
At least two metal binding residues have been identified in the E. coli homologue, YiiP (TC #2.A.4.1.5), and
one plays a role in H+ binding as well [19]. The two Zn2+/
Cd2+ binding residues are two interacting conserved
aspartyl residues (Asp-157 and Asp-49) at the dimer
interface of the homodimer [22]. The β-carboxyl groups
in these two residues were suggested to form a bimetal
binding center [21-23].
Lu and Fu [24] have reported the x-ray structure of YiiP
in complex with zinc at 3.8 angstrom resolution. YiiP is a
homodimer held together in a parallel orientation
through four Zn2+ ions at the interface of the cytoplasmic
domains. The two transmembrane domains swing out to
yield a Y-shaped structure. In each protomer, the cytoplasmic domain adopts a metallochaperone-like protein
fold. The transmembrane domain features a bundle of six
transmembrane helices and a tetrahedral Zn2+ binding
site located in a cavity that is open to the membrane outer
leaflet and the periplasm. The generalized transport reaction for CDF family members involves heavy metal:H+
antiport.

Similarity Searches & Construction of Phylogenetic Trees

PSI-Blast [25] searches were performed to screen the
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
non-redundant (nr) protein database using Homo sapiens
Orai1 (TC# 2.A.52.1.1; gi# 97180269), H. sapiens Stim1
(TC# 1.A.52.1.1; gi# 17368447) and the Bacillus subtilis
CDF antiporter, CzcD (TC# 2.A.4.1.3; gi# 16079718) as

query sequences. Protein sequence alignments were performed using ClustalX version 1.83 [26]. Redundant and
partial sequences were removed so that only unique, full
length, representative Orai, Stim and CDF homologues
were analyzed further. For this purpose, a modified CDHIT program [27,28] was used; for Orai proteins, the cutoff point was 90% sequence identity, while for CDF
sequences, it was 50%. Multiple alignment files adjusted
by ClustalX [26] were exported to files in Clustal format.
The TREEVIEW program [29] was used to display the
phylogenetic trees.
Establishment of Homology

To establish homology (common ancestry), either
between two proteins or between two internal segments
in a set of homologous proteins, the IC and GAP programs were initially used (our gold standard) [30-32]. For
establishing homology among putative full-length homologues, or repeat sequences of greater than sixty amino
acyl residues, a value of 9 - 10 S.D. is considered sufficient
[33,34]. According to [35], 9 standard deviations corresponds to a probability of 10-19 that this degree of similarity arose by chance, and 10 S.D. corresponds to a
probability of 10-24.
The GAP program produces a binary alignment, randomizes the two input sequences, and then compares the
native alignment with 100 randomly shuffled alignments.
We run this program five times and average the results,
which IC does automatically [28]. Quality as well as average quality, based on 100 randomizations (± standard
deviations) is presented in the output file. The standard
deviation values reported in this and other papers from
our laboratory are designated SD units by the GAP program and are generated using the equation: SD_Units =
(quality - average_quality)/standard_deviation (the number given after the ±). "SD units" are also called standardized scores or Z scores. They are frequently used to
compare scores produced by different methods because
they are independent of the scoring system. One can use
Z scores to compare results from different programs even
though the absolute scores obtained with these programs
are on completely different scales.
As will be shown in the results section, comparison of
Orai channel proteins with CDF carrier proteins gave a
maximal comparison score of 14.6 S.D., a value much
greater than required to establish homology [33,34]. As a
negative control, the three Orai (1-3) paralogues of H.
sapiens (TC# 1.A.52) were run against several 4 TMS
homologues of TWIK-1 (TC# 1.A.1.8.1) obtained using
the NCBI BLAST search tool. The comparison scores
resulting were low, between -1 and 5.5 S.D. Nothing
above 5.6 S.D. was obtained. This control provides further evidence that comparison scores reported (up to
14.6 S.D.) are highly significant.

The two proteins (or sets of domains) to be compared
were subjected to PSI-BLAST searches of the NCBI nonredundant protein database with a second iteration [28]
(criteria as described below). These criteria have successfully been used to demonstrate internal repeats within
dozens of transport protein families (see [36] for a
review). In no case have the conclusions obtained using
these methods been shown to be in error.
We have found that using a cut-off value of e-3 for the
initial BLAST search, and a cut-off value of e-4 for the second iteration, we reliably retrieve homologues with very
few false positives. Nevertheless, all retrieved proteins
giving e-values of e-5 or larger were tested for homology
using the GAP program with default settings, requiring a
comparison score of at least 9-10 S.D. in order to conclude that these proteins share a common origin. All hits
that satisfied these criteria were put through a modified
CD-HIT program with 90% cut-off [27,28] to eliminate
redundancies, fragmentary sequences, and sequences
with similarities of >90% identity. A multiple alignment
was generated with the ClustalX program [26], and
homology of all aligned sequences throughout the relevant transmembrane domains was established using the
IC and GAP programs [31,32]. Internal regions to be
examined for repeats were excised from the full-length
protein sequences based on the multiple alignment as
described in Zhou et al. [31], and dissimilar sets of segments were compared with potentially homologous
regions of the same proteins using the IC and GAP programs with default settings and 500 random shuffles.

reverse procedure was used where Protein-1 was used to
retrieve target sequences while Protein-2 was used to
generate the profile. NCBI-BLASTP searches against the
nr protein database were used with a cutoff e-value of
0.001. The homologous sequences in FASTA format were
checked for redundancies, fragments, and nearly identical sequences which were eliminated with a 90% identity
cutoff value using a modified CD-HIT program [28]. The
remaining sequences were aligned with ClustalX. The
hmmbuild program was used to build the profile HMM.
The profile was then calibrated with hmmcalibrate for
more accurate e-values. The sequence (FASTA) file of the
other protein (Protein-1) was then searched with the
resulting HMM profile. hmmsearch was used to search
the target sequence database, resulting in an output file
with domain and alignment annotation for each
sequence. HMMER2 commands used were:
hmmbuild <hmm file> <alignment file>
hmmcalibrate <hmm file>
hmmsearch <query or hmm file> <target
or sequence file>
Essentially the same procedures were used for SAM
and GGSEARCH, and the designations used for Proteins
1 and 2 were the same.
SAM [42,43]

To derive consensus sequences for the members of both
the Orai and CDF families, the HMMER package http://
hmmer.janelia.org; [37]) was used. All sequences of both
families included in these studies were used to derive the
consensus sequences. The hmmbuild program was used
to align the sequences and build the model. Then
hmmemit was used to generate the consensus sequence
for each family.

The homologous sequences from Protein-1 were trained
to build the model. The model was then searched against
the database consisting of homologous sequences from
Protein-2. The homologues of both proteins were generated using NCBI-BLASTP searches with a cutoff e-value
of 0.001, and the redundant sequences were removed
with CD-HIT before building the model. The reverse was
true for values provided in the bottom entries. The SAM
commands used were:
buildmodel
<model
name>
train
<training set> -randseed0
hmmscore <output> -i <model file> -db
<target sequence file> -sw 2 -calibrate 1

Comparison of Programs for Homology Estimation

GGSEARCH

More extensive evidence for homology was obtained by
comparing four distinct programs, (1) the IC/GAP program set described above, (2) GGSEARCH, (3) HMMER2
and 3, and (4) SAM [28,38]. HMMER2 and 3 gave similar
e-values. The use of these last three programs (2-4) was
as follows:

GGSEARCH of the FASTA package from the University
of Virginia http://fasta.bioch.virginia.edu/fasta_www2/
fasta_www.cgi?rm=select&pgm=gnw was used to compare the homologous FASTA sequences retrieved with
Protein-1 to those obtained with Protein-2. The best hit
from each comparison was from the resulting output file.
Format of presentation was as described above.

Derivation of Consensus Sequences

HMMER2 [39-41]

A single sequence (Protein-2) was used to retrieve
homologous target sequences to be used to screen the
HMM profile generated with a similar NCBI-BLASTP
search where Protein-1 was the query sequence. The

estimated using the WHAT program [45]. These programs were updated as described in [28,46]. Sequences
were spliced for statistical analyses as described by Zhou
et al., [31].

Cai [47] carried out phylogenetic analyses of Orai channel subunits, identifying potential Orai homologues in
Urochordata and (incorrectly) in Archaea. They correctly
reported two conserved apparent internal repeat
sequences in TMSs 1 and 3, both of which were known to
contain residues key to channel formation [47]. We here
extend these results. Three multiple alignments upon
which the results reported below were based can be
found in Supplementary figures S1A, B and C [Additional
files 1, 2 and 3], and the proteins presented are tabulated
in Tables S1, S2 and S3 [Additional files 4, 5 and 6] (see
our website: http://www.biology.ucsd.edu/~msaier/supmat/Crac. Table S1 presents representative homologues
of CRAC channels. Three human and three mouse orthologues were identified, Orai1, Orai2 and Orai3, which can
be found in clusters 1, 2 and 3 of the phylogenetic tree,
respectively; [Additional file 7: Figure S2A] [see also [47]].
This tree is based on the multiple alignment shown in
[Additional file 1: Figure S1A]. The chicken and frog have
Orai1 and Orai2 but not Orai3, which seems to be specific to mammals. Danio rerio has only Orai1. Additionally, single copies of Orai proteins are found in sea
urchins (cluster 4), insects (cluster 5), and roundworms
(cluster 6) [Additional file 7: Figure S2A].
Average hydropathy and similarity plots for the Orai
homologues are shown in Figure 1A. Four peaks of
hydrophobicity and similarity coincide. These correspond to predicted TMSs 1-4. Between TMSs 3 and 4 is a
region of low sequence similarity, not present in all Orai
proteins. The N- and C-termini are predicted to be in the
cytoplasm as documented previously [7].
The Stim proteins can be found in [Additional files 2, 8
and 5; Figures S1B, S2B and Table S2].Table S2 presents
the corresponding Stim1 homologues. Mammals, as well
as the chicken and the frog, possess Stim1 and Stim2 but
not Stim3. Danio rerio and all other organisms represented have only one Stim homologue. The phylogenetic
tree, based on the multiple alignment presented in Figure
S1B, is shown in [Additional file 8: Figure S2B]. The phylogenetic patterns suggest that the Orai and Stim proteins
evolved in parallel with a couple of potential exceptions.
The average hydropathy and similarity plots [Additional
file 9: Figure S3] revealed that the single large peak of
hydrophobicity, corresponding to the predicted TMS in
Stim proteins [48], occurs in a well conserved portion of
the alignment.

Figure 1 Average hydropathy and similarity plots for Orai and
CDF homologues. (A) Topological analyses of Orai protein homologues (see Table S1). The AveHAS program [28] was used to depict average hydropathy (top dark line) and average similarity (bottom light

of hydrophobicity, believed to correspond to the four TMSs, are labeled 1-4. (B) Topological analyses of CDF protein homologues (see
[Additional file 5: Table S2]). The majority of CDF proteins contain six
TMSs and correspond to the six conserved peaks labeled 1-6. Two
roundworm members contain twelve TMSs (see text). The N-terminal
6 TMSs of these latter proteins are labeled 1'-6'. Position: alignment position in the multiple alignment.

CDF antiporters

[Additional file 9: Table S3] presents 122 members of the
CDF family. These proteins derive from every major
domain and kingdom of living organisms for which
sequence data are available in the NCBI database, suggesting that they are essentially ubiquitous. Montanini et
al. [48], have analyzed the phylogenetic distribution of
CDF homologues and established that these proteins fall
into three major and two minor clusters. The major clusters segregate according to substrate specificity (cluster 1,
Zn2+; cluster 2, Fe2+/Zn2+, and cluster 3, Mn2+). The proteins analyzed here are all in cluster 1 of Montanini et al.
[48].
The average hydropathy and similarity plots for the
ClustalX aligned CDF sequences (see [Additional file 3:
Figure S1C] for the multiple alignment) are shown in Figure 1B, while the phylogenetic tree is shown in [Additional file 10: Figure S2C]. Six well conserved central
peaks and six poorly conserved N-terminal peaks of
hydrophobicity can be seen. The latter transmembrane
domain is homologous to the central domain and repre-

sents an internal repeat sequence in just 2 orthologues,
those from the roundworms, C. elegans and C. briggsae.
One protein, from the β-proteobacterium, Polynucleobacter sp. QLW-PIDMWA-1, has a large hydrophilic Cterminal domain that proved to be homologous to the
MhpC predicted hydrolase/acyltransferase of the α/β
hydrolase superfamily [49]. In the studies reported below,
only the homologous 6 TMS CDF proteins were analyzed.
Internal repeats in 6 TMS CDF homologues

We examined 6 TMS CDF proteins for the occurrence of
internal repeats. Three such repeats were found, each
consisting of a two TMS hairpin structure with the Nand C-termini inside (see Introduction). Binary alignments are depicted in Figure 2A-2B, and the statistical
analyses are presented in Table A1A. The results establish
that the 6 TMS CDF antiporters consist of three 2 TMS
hairpin repeats.
When TMSs 1-2 (segment 1-2) of CDF proteins were
compared with TMSs 3-4 (segment 3-4) of homologous
CDF carriers, the highest comparison score was obtained
(12.2 S.D.). This value corresponded to 28.6% identity and
44.6% similarity with a single gap. (see Figure 2A and
Table 1). When segment 3-4 was compared with segment
5-6, a score of 11 S.D., corresponding to 36.7% identity
and 48.3% similarity with two gaps was obtained (see Figure 2B and Table A1A). These values are sufficient to
establish homology [33]. Finally, only short regions of

Page 5 of 12

segment 1-2 and segment 5-6 gave good scores (up to 9
S.D.). This score of 9 S.D. was based on an alignment with
28.6% identity and 35.7% similarity with one gap (Table
1). Because of the shortness of this sequence, this value is
insufficient to establish homology. However the
sequences compared and the values obtained in Table
A1A are sufficient to establish homology. Thus, based on
the Superfamily Principle [50], since TMSs 1-2 are
homologous to TMSs 3-4, and TMSs 3-4 are homologous
to TMSs 5-6, TMSs 1-2 must be homologous to TMSs 56.
Homology of CDF antiporters with Orai channel proteins

A CRAC channel homologue of Caenorhabditis elegans,
Orai1a (gi# 211593603; e-33; 42% identical, 63% similar to
the mouse Orai2 (TC# 1.A.52.1.3; Q8BH10)) was used as
the query sequence to screen the NCBI database. Three
archaeal sequences that proved to be members of the
CDF family of heavy metal:proton antiporters were
retrieved below threshold. The best protein pair for
establishing homology between these three similar
archaeal proteins and established members of the CDF
family was a Pyrococcus furiosus homologue (gi#
1876930) compared to the Bacillus subtilis CzcD protein
(TC# 2.A.4.1.3). This pair gave a comparison score of e-54
(39% identity and 61% similarity).
Each of these three archaeal homologues was compared
with the conserved region of the C. elegans Orai1a homologues using BlastP http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/

scores were similar with values of ~e-6. The best score
was obtained with the P. furiosus sequence which yielded
an e-value of 6e-7 with 34% identity and 57% similarity
with no gaps for a 48 residue comparison (residues 3-51
in the C. elegans Orai1a protein and 62-110 in the P.
furiosus CDF protein. These regions correspond to TMSs
1-2 in the Orai protein and TMSs 3-4 in the CDF protein.
The C. elegans Orai protein sequence and the P. furiosus CDF protein sequence were used as query sequences
in NCBI BLAST searches. Eleven of each of the retrieved
sequences, each from a different species, were multiply
aligned giving the multiple alignment shown in [Additional file 11: Figure S4]. As can be seen, there are three
identities and many positions (28%) where only conservative substitutions occur. These results also support the
conclusion of homology between the CDF carriers and
CRAC channels.
When the two 2 TMS hairpin segments from Orai1
homologues were compared with the three 2 TMS hairpin segments of CDF carriers, comparison scores were
obtained as reported in Table 1. The maximal value was
obtained with the GAP program when segment 3-4 of
CDF was compared with segment 1-2 of Orai (Figure 3A;
Table B1B; 14.6 S.D.). When the same segments were
compared using the GLSEARCH program and the
GGSEARCH program, e-values of e-20 and x e-19 were

obtained, respectively. When segment 5-6 of a CDF
homologue was compared with segment 3-4 of an Orai
homologue (Figure 3B), the second largest score (8.6 S.D.)
was obtained. All other values were much lower (see
Table B1B). These results provide convincing evidence
that segment 1-2 of Orai arose from segment 3-4 of CDF,
that segment 3-4 of Orai arose from segment 5-6 of CDF,
and that segment 1-2 of CDF was lost during evolution of
the CRAC channels from CDF carriers (see also the Conclusions section).
In order to gain confirmatory evidence for homology
between CDF carriers and Orai channels, the HMMER
package was used to derive consensus sequences for both
families, and these were aligned using the GAP program
(see the Methods section). The results are presented in
Figure 4. Alignment of the two consensus sequences
revealed 30% identity and 46% similarity with three gaps.
In this alignment, TMSs 5 - 6 of the CDF family consensus sequence aligned with TMSs 3 - 4 of the Orai family
as expected. These values qualitatively confirm the quantitative measurements presented above.
Evaluation of four programs designed to detect and
evaluate sequence similarity

In an earlier publication [38], five programs ((1) IC/GAP,
(2) LALIGN, (3) GGSEARCH, (4) GLSEARCH and (5)
PairwiseStatSig) were compared to evaluate the capabilities of these programs to detect sequences similarities in
distantly related proteins. Based on the e-values obtained,
GGSEARCH and GLSEARCH proved to be more sensitive than LALIGN and PairwiseStatSig [38]. In this section, we compare both closely and distantly related
representative proteins from four different superfamilies

Figure 3 Comparisons obtained when the 2 TMS hairpin segments from Orai homologues were compared with 2 TMS segments of CDF
carriers. (A) The maximal comparison score value was obtained when segment 3-4 of CDF was compared with segment 1-2 of Orai (14.6 S.D.). (B)
When segment 5-6 of a CDF homologue was compared with segment 3-4 of an Orai homologue, the second largest score (8.6 S.D.) was obtained.
Significant similarity was not found when TMSs 1-2 of CDF proteins were compared with CRAC Orai homologues (Table 1B), leading to the proposal
set forth in Figure 5.

as well as their internal repeat sequences, using IC/GAP
and GGSEARCH as well as two additional programs,
HMMER and SAM. The superfamilies include (1) the
CRAC/CDF Superfamily described here, (2) the Drug/
Metabolite Transporter (DMT) Superfamily [51], (3) the
Bile acid/Arsenite/Riboflavin Transporter (BART) Superfamily [52] and (4) the Oligopeptide Transporter (OPT)
Superfamily [53; K.M. Gomolplitinant & M. H. Saier,
manuscript in preparation]. The results are presented in
Table 2.
The first two entries in Table 2 present comparisons
between the CDF family and the CRAC (Orai) family.
The first entry compares the complete sequences of both
proteins, while the second entry compares TMSs 3-4 in
the CDF protein with TMSs 1-2 in the Orai homologue.
These are the regions showing the greatest sequence similarity (see Table B1B). These comparisons using the IC/
GAP program set gave 14 S.D., a value far in excess of
what is required to establish homology. GGSEARCH also
gave values sufficient to strongly suggest homology (4.9e3 and 5.4e-5) for the full-length sequences, and 1.6e-18 and
9.4e-5 for the CDF TMSs 3-4 compared with Orai TMSs

1-2. According to the HMMER website, e-values smaller
than 0.1 are significant. By this criterion, one value
obtained with this program was borderline (0.09). Finally,
SAM gave one value (0.02) that was suggestive of homology.
The DMT superfamily was next examined (Table 2).
When 2 members of a single family within this superfamily were compared, all four programs predicted homology. The same was true for members of two distinct
families within this superfamily (SLC 35A1 with PfCRT),
and the degrees of sensitivity detected by the last three
programs were GGSEARCH (G) >SAM (S) >HMMER
(H).
For the BART superfamily, three different comparisons
were run: the first between two families of known transport function, and the second two between families of
unknown function where the transmembrane domain
may serve as an "anchor" or "receptor" [52]. In the first
comparison, the sensitivities of the three programs was G
> H > S. In the second and third comparisons, the order
was again G > H > S, but S did not give significant e-values.

Figure 4 Alignment of the Consensus Sequence for the CDF Family (TMSs 5 and 6 and flanking regions) with the Consensus Sequence for
the Orai Family (TMSs 3 and 4 and flanking regions). The consensus sequences were generated using the HMMER package (see Methods). The
two consensus sequences were aligned using the GAP program (GCG package). This alignment shows 30% identity and 46% similarity with 3 gaps.
TMSs were predicted with the TMHMM program http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM. Each amino acid shown in the consensus sequence is the
highest probability amino acid at that position according to the Hidden Markov Model.

comparison scores obtained with the IC and GAP programs, other than the CRAC/CDF comparisons, are published as follows: DMT superfamily: Tran & Saier, 2004; see also Jack et al., 2001;
BART superfamily: Mansour et al., 2007. The HMMER and IC/GAP values for comparison of the CRAC (Orai) and CDF families, as well as the OPT family, have not been published previously.

OPT family members consist of 16TMS proteins that
arose by two successive duplication events where a 4TMS
encoding genetic segment probably duplicated internally
to give an 8TMS product, and the gene encoding this
duplicated product again duplicated internally to give the
current 16TMS members of the family (K.M. Gomolplitinant & M.H. Saier, unpublished results).
The two 8TMS halves and the four 4TMS repeat units
in members of this family were compared with each other
using all four programs (Table 2; OPT; bottom). When
the two halves were compared, IC/GAP gave 13 S.D., far
in excess of what is required to establish homology (9-10
S.D.) The other three programs also detected similarity
with scores that were G > H > S. When the 4TMS repeat
units were compared, values of 10-14 S.D. were obtained
with IC/GAP. Scores for detection of similarity by the
other 3 programs were in three cases G > H > S and in
three cases G > S > H.
When considering all fourteen comparisons (Table 2),
eight showed G > H > S, five showed G > S > H, and one
showed H > S > G. Thus, while we consider IC/GAP to be
the "gold standard" for establishing homology, we suggest
that of the three remaining programs, for the purpose of
detecting sequence similarities, GGSEARCH is better
than HMMER, which is better than SAM (the most timeconsuming program to use). However, since SAM was
better than HMMER in five cases, and HMMER was better than GGSEARCH in one case, we conclude that the
use of all three of these programs is superior to the use of
any one or two of them when time and effort are not limiting. We recommend IC/GAP and GGSEARCH as the

two most sensitive programs for detection of significant
sequence similarity between distantly related homologues. It should be noted that if one program detects significant sequence similarity, and any number of programs
do not, the first program, giving positive results, is to be
trusted over those that give negative results because only
the first program is likely to have correctly aligned the
sequences being compared so as to identify their common features.

Conclusions
We have shown that the Orai Ca2+ channel proteins of
animal CRAC channel complexes are homologous to the
ubiquitous metal:H+ antiporters of the CDF family. Our
results lead us to suggest that the evolutionary process
involved loss of TMSs 1-2 in the primordial CDF carrier,
leaving TMSs 3-6 (TMSs 1-4 of Orai). The relative values
for the comparison scores when hairpin structures of
Orai channels were compared with corresponding hairpin structures of CDF carriers lead to a single preferred
prediction for the evolutionary pathway taken, namely
that the pathway by which the Orai channel arose from a
CDF carrier involved genetic deletion of the first hairpin
structure of CDF carriers. The alternative route, direct
duplication of the primordial 2 TMS hairpin structures is
not favored by the data (Figure 5). Using a total of seven
programs for constructing sequence comparisons [38],
we conclude that overall, the order of sensitivities and
reliabilities for these programs is: IC/GAP = GGSEARCH
and GLSEARCH > HMMER, LALIGN and PairwiseStatSig > SAM.
Table 3 compares the properties of CDF carriers (left)
with CRAC channels (right). (1) While the former are
carriers, the latter are simple channels. (2) While the former are ubiquitous in all domains of life and are found in
both plasma and intracellular membranes of eukaryotes,
the latter occur specifically at the plasma membrane/
endoplasmic reticular junction of animal (and possibly a
few other eukaryotic) cells. They presumably arose late in
eukaryotes and have not been detected in prokaryotes.
(3) Although CDF carriers have 6 TMSs while Orai channels have 4, both consist of 2 TMS repeat units, and both
have their N- and C-termini inside; they thus have the
same orientation in the membrane. (4) While CDF carriers exhibit tremendous size and sequence variation, suggestive of an ancient origin, CRAC channels show
relatively little variation, consistent with a more recent
origin. Their restricted organismal distribution compared
to the ubiquitous CDF carriers is in agreement with this
conclusion. (5) Finally, a pair of acidic residues in both
proteins appears to function in cation binding. All of
these observations are consistent with the proposed evolutionary pathway.

The consequences of our observations are of great
importance. For the first time, structural modeling of
CRAC channels, based on the known 3-d structure of
CDF carriers [24], is possible. Moreover, limited extrapolation of functional and mechanistic data is now feasible.
We hope that the bioinformatic analyses reported will
greatly accelerate our understanding of the structurefunction relationships of CRAC and CDF proteins.
