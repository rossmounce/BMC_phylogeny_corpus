Abstract
Background: Ascidians are tunicates, the taxon recently proposed as sister group to the
vertebrates. They possess a chordate-like swimming larva, which metamorphoses into a sessile
adult. Several ascidian species form colonies of clonal individuals by asexual reproduction. During
their life cycle, ascidians present three muscle types: striated in larval tail, striated in the heart, and
unstriated in the adult body-wall.
Results: In the colonial ascidian Botryllus schlosseri, we investigated organisation, differentiation and
gene expression of muscle beginning from early buds to adults and during zooid regression. We
characterised transcripts for troponin T (BsTnT-c), adult muscle-type (BsMA2) and cytoplasmic-type
(BsCA1) actins, followed by in situ hybridisation (ISH) on sections to establish the spatio-temporal
expression of BsTnT-c and BsMA2 during asexual reproduction and in the larva. Moreover, we
characterised actin genomic sequences, which by comparison with other metazoans revealed
conserved intron patterns.
Conclusion: Integration of data from ISH, phalloidin staining and TEM allowed us to follow the
phases of differentiation of the three muscle kinds, which differ in expression pattern of the two
transcripts. Moreover, phylogenetic analyses provided evidence for the close relationship between
tunicate and vertebrate muscle genes. The characteristics and plasticity of muscles in tunicates are
discussed.

Background
Ascidians (Tunicata) are marine filter-feeding invertebrates that possess a chordate-like swimming larva, which
undergoes metamorphosis to form a sessile adult. Typically, they develop three types of muscles during their life
cycle: striated in the larval tail, striated in the heart and
unstriated in the adult body-wall [1]. The later is com-

monly called 'smooth muscle', though evidence for
homology to vertebrate smooth muscle is weak.
In the larval tail, two bands of mononucleated muscle
cells are localised in paraxial position, flanking the notochord and the neural tube. The organisation of their
myofibrils resembles that of vertebrate muscle, especially

in the arrangement of thin and thick filaments [2-4]. In
solitary ascidian embryos, a predetermined number of
cells define the muscle lineage (B4.1, A4.1 and b.4.2 blastomeres of the 8-cell stage) [5-8]. Recently, it has been
observed that homologues of the transcription factors
MyoD, Snail and Tbx6, important regulators of vertebrate
myogenesis, are expressed during mesoderm differentiation of ascidian embryos [9,10].
During ascidian embryogenesis, the B7.5 blastomeres give
rise to the heart precursors which, after the neurulation,
are localised bilaterally and named trunk ventral cells
(TVCs) [11]. During metamorphosis, these cells migrate
ventrally and contribute to heart tube formation [12]. The
myocardium is formed of mononucleated muscle cells
with a degree of homology with the heart of vertebrates,
in their general structure and the sarcomeric organisation
of the myofilaments [13]. At metamorphosis, the larva
adheres to a substrate and its tail regresses completely,
while the unstriated muscle of the sessile juvenile begins
to be recognisable.
The unstriated muscle forms a series of circular and longitudinal bands, which run in the mantle around the oral
and atrial siphons and the remaining body-wall. The caudal larval musculature does not contribute to adult bodywall muscle formation. It was proposed that the atrial
siphon and circular muscles, together with heart muscle,
derive from TVCs, localised laterally to the ventral endoderm [14] and that oral siphon and longitudinal muscles
differentiate from trunk lateral cells (TLCs), flanking the
visceral ganglion [11]. These muscles have multinucleated
cells and do not show any clearly regular sarcomeric
arrangement; however, contraction occurs through the
troponin/tropomyosin (Tn/Tm) system and is regulated
by calcium ions like in striated muscle of vertebrates [1519]. Moreover, the ascidian body-wall muscle is activated
through both muscarinic and nicotinic-type acetylcholine
receptors [20-23], as occurs respectively in vertebrate
smooth and skeletal muscle [24].
The study of genes coding for proteins associated with the
contractile regulatory system can help us to understand
the evolution of chordate muscle and the developmental
mechanisms in which these genes are involved, and
amongst these genes the actins are notable for their highly
conserved sequences. Actins are encoded by a multigene
family and the expression of each isoform characterises a
specific developmental stage or tissue. In several species of
solitary ascidians, multiple genes have been characterised
that code for both muscle actins (MAs) and non-muscle
cytoplasmic actins (CAs) [25-34]. In particular, sequence
analyses of cDNA clones have shown at least two different
MA isoforms, one in larval muscle and another in bodywall muscle, and while it is not clear which actin is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/9/48

expressed in the heart, it seems to also be different from
the larval form [35]. The Tn/Tm regulatory system is common to both vertebrate and invertebrate striated muscle
[36], but Tn does not play a role in vertebrate smooth
muscle. The troponin complex constitutes TnT, TnI and
TnC, which with Tm act as a regulatory switch for striated
muscle contraction [37]. Ascidian unstriated muscle has
the peculiarity to possess Tns whose presence has been
demonstrated both in Halocynthia roretzi and Ciona intestinalis [15,16,34].
Previous molecular studies of ascidian actins and Tns have
all addressed solitary species with studies focused on
expression at embryonic stages.
Botryllus schlosseri is a colonial ascidian emerging as a
model for the study of the developmental mechanisms
involved in formation of similar zooids by alternative
developmental way, that is the oozooid derived from metamorphosed larva and blastozooid derived from palleal
budding [38]. It forms colonies of numerous clonal individuals organised in star-shaped systems embedded in a
thin common tunic. Three blastogenetic generations
develop synchronously in each colony: the filtering
adults, their buds and the budlets of the last generation.
Weekly, all the adults regress and are resorbed, while their
buds become the new filtering adults and a new generation of budlets is produced. Different to embryonic and
larval tissues, which all derive from germ cells, all the blastozooid tissues arise from somatic cells.
In this study, we described the musculature in B. schlosseri
analysing its organisation, differentiation and gene
expression in larvae and in developing blastozooids,
beginning from the early bud to the adult and regression
stages. We isolated and characterised B. schlosseri cDNA
clones encoding homologues of a MA (BsMA2), a TnT
(BsTnT-c) and a CA (BsCA1); we also obtained the
genomic sequences coding for both BsMA2 and BsCA1,
comparing exon-intron organisation to other metazoan
actin genes. Phylogenetic analyses with both BsMA2 and
BsTnT-c showed a close relationship between urochordate
and vertebrate muscle genes. In situ hybridisation (ISH),
in parallel with phalloidin staining experiments allowed
us to follow the differentiation of the three muscle kinds,
which differed in the expression pattern of the two transcripts. The ultrastructure of striated cardiac and unstriated muscle cells was also investigated during the entire
blastogenetic cycle from early bud to zooid regression.

Methods
Animals and embryos
Colonies of Botryllus schlosseri (Styelidae, Stolidobranchia)
were collected in the Lagoon of Venice, cultured according
to Sabbadin's technique [39] and fed with Liquifry Marine

(Liquifry Co., Dorking, England). The transparency of the
colonies allowed us to follow the daily development in
vivo of buds under the stereomicroscope, thereby permitting the selection of appropriate stages. Before utilisation,
colonies were staged following Sabbadin's method (see
[40]) and anesthetised with MS222 (Sigma) to prevent
muscle contractions. Embryos are brooded and mature
colonies release swimming tadpole larvae, utilised for the
below described in situ hybridisation procedure.
Phalloidin staining
Fragments of colonies were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
(Sigma) in seawater at 4°C overnight. After washes in
phosphate buffered saline (PBS), the fragments were
transferred in a buffer solution of PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) at 4°C for 2 h to increase tissue permeability. Subsequently, for F-actin labelling, samples were
incubated in a 1:100 phalloidin -FITC or -TRITC conjugated (Sigma) PBS solution, for 2 h in the dark at RT
(room temperature). To remove unbound phalloidin conjugate, specimens were washed in PBS and then mounted
with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) and observed.
Samples were photographed with a Leica 5000B light
microscope accessorised with a Leica DFC 480 digital
photo camera and images organised with Adobe Photoshop CS3.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
Colonies were anesthetised with MS222 and fixed in 1.5%
glutaraldehyde buffered with 0.2 M sodium cacodylate,
pH 7.4, and 1.6% NaCl. After washing in buffer and postfixation in 1% OsO4 in 0.2 M cacodylate buffer, specimens were dehydrated and embedded in Epon 812 resin.
Thanks to the transparency of the resin, the specimens
were oriented before ultramicrotome cutting. Series of
thick sections (1 μm) were stained with toluidine blue
and observed to check appropriate levels for preparing
ultrathin sections (60 nm), which were given contrast by
staining with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Photomicrographs were taken with a Hitachi H-600 electron microscope (Hitachi High-Technologies Europe GmbH,
Krefeld, Germany) operating at 80 V; images were then
organised with Adobe Photoshop CS3.
Identification of transcripts
Partial sequences of cDNAs coding for BsMA2, BsCA1 and
BsTnT-c were obtained by screening EST clusters derived
from B. schlosseri colonies enriched full-length cDNA
library (for details see [41]). Resequencing of the BsMA2
clones (BMR Genomics) revealed the complete coding
sequence, plus part of 5' and 3' UTRs (untranslated
region) [EMBL: FN178503]. BsCA1 and BsTnT-c cDNA
clones were incomplete in 5' and 3' regions respectively.
The complete transcripts of BsCA1 and BsTnT-c [EMBL:
FN178501 and FN178505] were hence obtained by PCR

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/9/48

using, as template, an amplified plasmid library purified
pool. The amplification of the library was made following
the manufacturer instructions (Creator™ SMART™ cDNA
Library Construction Kit, Clontech); the plasmid purification of the pool was obtained using QIAprep Midiprep Kit
(Qiagen). The primers were designed (see additional file
1) and used as follows: i) the forward primer pDNR-LibFW1 (in the vector sequence) with the reverse primer
BsCA-RW1 (in the known partial sequence of the BsCA1),
ii) one of the forward primers BsTnT-FW1 and BsTnT-FW2
(in the known partial sequence of BsTnT-c) with the
reverse primer pDNR-Lib-RW1 (in the vector sequence).
PCR cycling was performed in a Mastercycler epGradient
S (Eppendorf) thermocycler as follow: 94°C for 2', (94°C
for 30", 68°C for 30", 72°C for 2') for 35 cycles, 72°C for
8', using Biotaq (Bioline) DNA Polymerase. Ethidium
Bromide (Fluka) stained bands from 0.8% agarose gel
electrophoresis of the PCRs were subsequently extracted
(QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit, Qiagen), cloned into pCRIITOPO vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced on both strands
(BMR Genomics).
Identification of actin genomic sequences
Genomic DNA from B. schlosseri was obtained by incubating a small colony overnight in an extraction buffer (TrisHCl 50 mM pH 8, EDTA 0.1 mM pH 8, SDS 1%, Proteinase K 0.5 μg/μl). This was followed by: i) centrifugation at
13,000 rpm in a benchtop microcentrifuge, ii) a phenol/
chloroform purification and iii) ethanol precipitation and
re-suspension in 100 μl H2O. PCRs were done using this
genomic DNA as template and primers (see additional file
1) designed to the BsMA2 and BsCA1 sequences obtained:
MAgen_R and MAgen_F primers for BsMA2, 5'BsCA-gen
and 3'BsCA-gen primers for BsCA1. Ethidium Bromide
stained bands from agarose gel (0.8%) electrophoresis of
the PCRs were treated as described previously. After cloning and sequencing, the sequences were identified as the
annotated genomic BsMA2 and genomic BsCA1 [EMBL:
FN178504 and FN178502]. All the above mentioned
primers were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Molecular phylogeny and in silico prediction
Alignments and pairwise identity scores were constructed
with CLUSTALW2 on the EMBL-EBI site http://
www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/clustalw2/index.html[42-44]. using
default parameters on datasets comprising the B. schlosseri
predicted amino acid sequences deposited in EMBL.
Sequences from other species were downloaded from
GenBank, JGI or HGSC (see additional files 2, 3 and Figure 1 for accession numbers). Bayesian phylogenetic analysis was conducted in MrBayes3.1 (default settings
[45,46]) using the aligned complete amino acidic
sequences of 65 actins and the trimmed alignment of 54
complete amino acidic sequences of TnTs (see supplementary material for alignments). The analysis was con-

Molecular phylogenetic analysis of the troponin T protein family
Molecular phylogenetic analysis of the troponin T protein family. Bayesian methodology based upon the alignment
trimmed (this included removal of both ends, plus some sites in the middle with large insertions in one or a small subset of
sequences) as shown in additional file 5. Values adjacent to nodes indicate posterior probabilities. Some inferred groupings are
boxed in grey, labelled to the right of the figure and with supporting value in bold. The vertebrate sequences fall into three
groups reflecting the well-characterised TnT1, TnT2 and TnT3 genes, with a fourth group (labelled Fish TnT1/2) containing
only bony fish sequences, the relationship of which to other TnT groups cannot be determined. The B. schlosseri (BsTnT-c,
black highlighted) sequence falls into a group of ascidian sequences. Note that another ascidian, H. roretzi (Hr), has two TnT
protein, and the B. schlosseri sequence is most closely related to the adult (HrTnT-a) one. Protostome sequences have been
used to root the tree, as TnT genes have not been identified outside the bilateria. The positioning of echinoderm (S. purpuratus;
Sp) and amphioxus (B. floridae; Bfl) sequences reflects the likely phylogenetic relationships of these taxa. Accession numbers of

tinued for 1 million generations, examined for
convergence and the first 25% discarded when compiling
summary statistics and consensus trees. Phylogenetic trees
were viewed in Treeview [47] and then imported into
PowerPoint for labelling. NetPhosK and NetAcet [48,49]
were used to improve prediction of kinase specific protein
phosphorylation sites and substrates of N-acetyltransferase A respectively. Determination of exon-intron
arrangements of BsCA1 and BsMA2 genes was performed
by aligning mRNA to genomic sequences with Spidey tool
[50].
In situ hybridisation (ISH)
An RNA probe for BsMA2 was obtained by cloning the
original insert of the cDNA library clone in pGEM-3Z vector (Promega); the probe, coding for a 1375 bp specific
region, comprises the complete annotated transcript. RNA
antisense probe for BsTnT-c was obtained from a clone in
pCRII-TOPO vector, resulting from the PCR described
above on the amplified cDNA pool; the probe comprises
a 1004 bp specific 3' region, and includes the entire coding sequence of the annotated transcript. According to the
protocol supplied with the DIG RNA Labelling kit (Roche
Molecular Biochemicals) and the vectors, an appropriate
restriction enzyme (NotI or HindIII, Promega) and T7 or
SP6 RNA polymerase (Promega) were used to linearise the
vector and obtain antisense probe.

Specimens for ISH (B. schlosseri colonies or mature larvae)
were fixed overnight in freshly prepared MOPS buffered
(0.1 M MOPS (Sigma), 1 mM MgSO4 (Sigma), 2 mM
EGTA (Fluka), 0.5 M NaCl) 4% paraformaldehyde (Taab).
Fixative was removed by washing twice in PBS pH 7.4
(Oxoid) and then samples were dehydrated through
graded PBS/Ethanol to 100% then washed in xylene and
embedded in Paraplast Plus (Sherwood Medical). Samples were serially sectioned (12 μm) and left to adhere to
microscope slides, cleaned from the Paraplast with xylene
(15 min), rehydrated in a graded series of ethanol to PBS,
then used immediately. Sections were incubated (6 min)
in 10 μg/ml proteinase K (Promega) in PBS; the enzyme
action was then stopped with a solution of 0.2% glycine
in PBS, washed in PBS, postfixed in a 4% paraformaldehyde plus 0.2% glutaraldehyde solution in PBS and rewashed in PBS. Samples were then incubated in the
hybridisation mix (50% formamide (Fluka), 1% Blocking
Reagent (Roche), 5 mM EDTA (Fluka), 0.1% Tween-20
(Sigma), 0.1% CHAPS (Roche), 1 mg/ml heparin (Sigma)
and 1 mg/ml tRNA (Roche), SSC 5×) 1 h at 65°C and after
overnight with 1-2 μg/ml DIG-labelled riboprobes. Specimens were washed twice in 2× SSC pH 4.5, three times in
formamide 50% in 2× SSC pH 4.5 30 min at 65°C, and
twice in PBS-T (0.1% Tween-20 in PBS). Subsequently
slides were: i) incubated in a blocking solution (2% Blocking Reagent, 10% goat serum (Sigma) in PBS-T) 1 h at RT
and then overnight with an alkaline phosphatase conju-

gate anti-DIG-antibody (Roche) for riboprobe detection,
ii) treated with a NBT/BCIP solution (Roche) as alkaline
phosphatase substrate, until the dye was detectable, iii)
dehydrated in ethanol to a final step of xylene (15 min)
and mounted in Eukitt (Electronic Microscopy Sciences).
Sections were photographed with a Leica 5000B light
microscope accessorised with a Leica DFC 480 digital

Results
Isolation and characterisation of BsMA2, BsCA1 and
BsTnT-c
From a full-length cDNA library derived from B. schlosseri
colonies we isolated three clones that a BLAST search
identified as encoding probable muscle-type actin, cytoplasmic-type actin and troponin T respectively. The three
cDNA clones each include the complete predicted open
reading frame (ORF), plus part of the 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs). Moreover, genomic sequences
encompassing the exons encoding the complete ORF of
both actin genes were isolated from genomic DNA
obtained from B. schlosseri colonies.
Actins
The two actin cDNA clones are 1375 and 1700 bp long,
with ORFs of 1140 and 1131 bp from which we deduce
respective sequences of 379 and 376 amino acids. The predicted amino acid sequences are aligned with actins of
other metazoans and specific amino acid residues distinctive for vertebrate muscle and cytoplasmic actin forms are
compared [51,52] (see additional file 4 for a schematic
view; see additional file 5 for the complete alignment). As
shown in additional file 4, the sequence that shares 13 of
20 diagnostic residues in common with the mammalian
α-skeletal actin is named BsMA2 (B. schlosseri Muscle Actin
2) and is coding for a muscular actin form. The other
sequence is more related to the vertebrate cytoplasmic
actins, so we named it BsCA1 (B. schlosseri Cytoplasmic
Actin 1). We note that a region of the transcript here characterised was identified in a previous work [53].

The alignment analysis reveals that BsMA2 is characterised
by the same amino acid residues as the ascidian adult
muscle actins at diagnostic positions (103, 176 and 272).
The amino-terminal region is highly variable between
BsMA2 and BsCA1, as was found in other species (additional file 6). The adult muscle actin of B. schlosseri
(BsMA2) lacks the Cys residue after the first Met and possesses a series of six acidic amino acids (D and E). This is
consistent with the situation of the other chordates, where
the muscle actins are characterised by at least four acidic
residues in the first positions.
The amino-terminal of BsCA1 has a Cys next to the first
Met like the non-chordate cytoplasmic actins and lacks

both the typical acidic amino acids and additional residues that characterise the muscle isoforms (Thr6, Cys10,
Leu16 and Val17; additional file 4).
Troponin T
The third cDNA clone isolated from the cDNA library is
1103 bp long and encodes for a predicted protein of 261
amino acids, deduced from an open reading frame of 786
nucleotides. An alignment with other isoforms of troponin T isoforms showed the presence of specific amino
acids in conserved positions (see additional file 7). We
hence named the clone BsTnT-c (B. schlosseri Troponin Tc). The TnTs of both vertebrates and ascidians are normally composed of a single polypeptide chain of about
250 to 300 residues, whereas the invertebrate forms
exhibit an additional polar C-terminal extension of about
100 amino acids [54]. The N-terminal displays a series of
acidic residues, rich in glutamic acid. BsTnT-c also has this
glutamic acid rich N-terminal region, though it is shorter
than that in most vertebrates. Ser2, the first residue after
methionine, is normally acetylated and phosphorylated
by casein kinase II (CKII) in the rabbit skeletal muscle TnT
isoform (OcTnT2f) [55,56]. BsTnT-cpossesses both the
Ser2 and a sequence that is compatible with the consensus
site of casein kinase II (S2XXE, additional file 7) [57]. This
also conforms to NetPhosK and NetAcet software predictions (see methods) of BsTnT-c Ser2 residue as phosphorylated and acetylated site with a score of 0.71 and 0.52
respectively. The alignment with other ascidian and vertebrate TnTs reveals that the central region of the protein is
more conserved than the N- and C-terminals and probably contains the interaction site for Tm (see additional file
7) [58-60]. Taking into consideration what it is known in
vertebrates, we found that regions displaying a certain
degree of similarity with other components of the troponin complex, such as Tm, TnC and TnI (see additional
file 8) are recognisable by comparison and demonstrated
to be more conserved [[54,58,59,61] and [62]].

The analysis extended to the entire length of the sequence
shows that the two ascidian species possess a TnT that is
more similar to OcTnT2f, a vertebrate isoform, with
respect to the cephalochordate and echinoderm TnTs.
This pattern is also maintained when we consider only the
regions subject to the interaction with other proteins.
Exon-intron organisation of BsMA2 and BsCA1
Fragments of genomic DNA corresponding to both
BsMA2 and BsCA1 were amplified by polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) and subsequently sequenced. We obtained
clones of 1975 and 1752 nucleotides, corresponding
respectively to the entire coding region for the BsMA2 and
to the coding region together with part of the 3' UTR for
BsCA1. The exon-intron organisation, analysed between
the start and stop codons, revealed the presence of four

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/9/48

introns in BsMA2, which interrupt the sequence at the
amino acid positions 45-3, 153-1, 208-2 and 271-1 (additional file 2; numbers after the amino acid residue indicate codon phase number of intron). Six intron positions
are present in BsCA1 (42-3, 114-3, 150-3, 204-1, 247-3
and 308-1; additional file 2), as previously reported in the
ascidian HrCA1 [35].
Phylogenetic analysis of actin and troponin T sequences
The deduced amino acid sequences of BsCA1, BsMA2 and
BsTnT-c were used for the molecular phylogenetic analyses. The Bayesan phylogenetic tree for actins (see additional file 3) results in many nodes poorly supported or
collapsed. The cytoplasmic actins together with the nonchordate invertebrate forms are separated from the chordate muscle isoforms. BsCA1 and BsMA2 fall to the first
and the second groups respectively. Further, BsMA2 is
placed in a robustly supported group of ascidian adult
MAs. Interestingly, ascidian larval MAs form a robustly
supported separate group.

A Bayesian phylogenetic tree was also constructed for TnT
(Figure 1). In this tree BsTnT-c groups with the other
ascidian TnTs, and in particular is most related to the
adult TnT of H. roretzi. Ascidian TnTs group with vertebrate TnTs, when the tree is rooted with protostome TnTs.
Vertebrate TnTs reflect the well-characterised skeletal-slow
(TnT1), cardiac (TnT2) and skeletal-fast (TnT3) groups,
with a fourth poorly supported group (posterior probability 0.67) containing only bony fish sequences.
General organisation of musculature in the adult
blastozooid
Body-wall
We describe the musculature in the colonial ascidian B.
schlosseri, analysing muscle organisation in the adult blastozooid (Figure 2A-N) using phalloidin-staining, ISH on
sections and TEM. In blastozooids stained with phalloidin-FITC, superficial muscles are organised in a tightly
packed network of circular and longitudinal fibres, which
run throughout the whole body-wall (Figures 2A-C). Circular fibres are mainly concentrated around the siphons,
whereas the longitudinal ones constitute muscles that
depart from the external wall of the oral siphon to the lateral region of the zooid. The combination of phalloidin
staining and ISH against the BsMA2 and BsTnT-c mRNAs
(Figures 2D-H) permitted a detailed reconstruction of the
arrangement of muscle fibres (Figure 3). An inner and an
outer fibre system are evident at the oral siphon level. The
outer system is formed by a series of about twenty bundles
that surround the opening, with a concentric disposition
from the apical portion of the siphon to the base of
velum. From this point about ten fibres extend in the
direction of the pericoronal bands, until the conjunction
between the branchial sac and mantle: radial bundles

which thin and thick filaments bind. The disposition of
these dense bodies is not random, however it was not possible to establish if they are distributed according a specific pattern (Figure 2J).
Fibres are covered by fuzzy material forming a thin basal
lamina. In some cases, contiguous fibres present their sarcolemma closely apposed to each other and the extra-cellular material is no longer recognisable. Nervous fibres
contact single muscle cells or penetrate between apposed
fibres and form neuromuscular junctions (Figure 2K),
which have been previously described as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) positive [64].

originate from the oral siphon reaching a perpendicular
disposition with the circular fibres, both forming a regular
network of filaments in the anterior and lateral region of
the zooid (Figures 2A, D-E).
A complex of numerous transverse bundles forms the
inner muscular system, placed around the siphon opening. At the base of the siphon, muscle fibres concentrate
around the velum but do not penetrate into the tentacles
(Figure 2F) [63]. The common cloacal siphon forms after
the confluence of the atrial siphons of each zooid, and
possesses a dense musculature (Figures 2C, G). At this
level, the transverse fibres appear more packed and surround the atrial siphon, extending subsequently along the
dorsal languets, which are connected to each other to constitute the common cloacal chamber (Figures 2C, G). The
internal organs do not show signs of musculature, except
for two longitudinal fibres that depart from the neural
complex area, move down along the dorsal lamina and
run in the mantle through the gastric trabecula (Figures
2B, H). Anteriorly, fibres elongate around the oral siphon,
following the pericoronal sinuses border (Figure 2B).
The ultrastructural organisation of musculature shows
that all the unstriated muscle fibres share similar features
in each part of the zooid. The cytoplasm is filled with contractile material (Figure 2I) and most cell organelles, such
as nuclei and mitochondria, are confined in peripheral
regions of the fibres. The contractile material consists of
thin and thick filaments closely apposed, and in longitudinal sections do not reveal any sarcomeric organisation
(Figure 2J). However, occasionally in transverse sections
the thick filaments appear surrounded by thin filaments
with the arrangement recalling that of the striated muscle
(Figure 2K, inset). Dense bodies are recognisable in longitudinal sections along the fibre, representing regions to

Heart
The heart of B. schlosseri is located in the ventral mantle
and extends between the posterior limit of the endostyle
and the stomach. It is in form of a curved double walled
tube of external pericardium and internal myocardium,
connected to each other at the level of the longitudinal
rafe. The myocardium is responsible for the reversible,
helicoidal contraction that drives blood movement. Phalloidin staining allows us to recognise muscle fibres at the
myocardium level, organised in a dense network of transverse thin bundles. At the ultrastructural level (Figure 2L)
the myocardic cells appear polarised, with the contractile
material organised in striated myofibrils close to the cardiac lumen. The sarcomeric distribution and the ratio 1:2
of thick to thin filaments recalls the striated musculature
of the larva [65]. In many sections it is possible to see a
deeper layer of myofibrils oriented in a right angle with
respect the superficial one. ISH for the localisation of
BsMA2 transcripts show signal at the myocardial level,
localised between stomach and branchial sac (Figure 2M).
No BsTnT-c expression was found in the heart of the adult
zooid (Figure 2N).
Musculature differentiation during the blastogenetic cycle
Body-wall
We investigated the differentiation of unstriated muscles
during the entire blastogenetic cycle, beginning from the
appearance of a budlet to the adult stage and zooid regression. Results from phalloidin, TEM and ISH experiments
allowed us to follow in detail the musculature modifications throughout each developmental stage (summarised
in Figure 4A-L). Antisense RNA probes designed against
BsMA2 and BsTnT-c mRNAs provided similar results.

In the early phases of bud development, no phalloidin
signal was detected. Signal then began to be recognisable
in the form of a diffuse fluorescence throughout the
whole bud, but no discrete muscle fibres were distinguishable. At the same time, the first evidence of the diffuse
expression of BsMA2 and BsTnT-c transcripts appeared just
before the formation of a new blastogenetic generation
from the body-wall of bud (stage 6). Both probes produce

a diffuse signal, labelling a localised region between oral
and atrial siphon and staining cells probably representing
mesenchymal cells differentiating into myoblasts (Figures
4A-B). These cells begin to organise to form bundles of
fibres; the siphons are in form of rudiments as epidermal
thickenings. In the next stage, the body-wall musculature
generates a network of fibres (Figure 4C) and signs of gene
expression are observable in fibres that run along the dorsal lamina and through the recto-oesophageal trabecula
(Figures 4D-F). The presence of differentiating myoblasts
has been confirmed with TEM: they appear as circulating
cells, which adhere and group to the mantle epithelia
close to the developing siphons and are characterised by
contractile material in their cytoplasm (Figure 4G).
Subsequently, the heart begins to beat and organogenesis
progresses. Thin, discrete, apparently disorganised muscle
fibres start to be recognisable with phalloidin (Figure 4H)
and, approaching the opening of the siphon, the muscle
fibres become thicker and reach the definitive regular
organisation, extending laterally to envelope the rest of
the body (Figure 4I). At this stage, the fibres that run
around the velum and the pericoronal bands are particularly evident, as seen on ISH sections using both BsMA2
and BsTnT-c probes (not shown).
During takeover, the primary buds open their siphons,
replacing the adult zooids, which are contracting to the
centre of the system and are gradually reabsorbed. The
regressing muscle fibres become more irregular and show
decreased level in expression for both BsMA2 and BsTnT-c
transcripts, as compared to the filtering zooids (Figures 4JK). The contraction of fibres leads to the formation of
cytoplasmic protrusions along the contractile material,
which contain degenerating organelles (Figure 4L). The
contractile material condenses to form a rigid structure,
the paracrystalline body [66]. As with the other zooid tissues, the muscle cells are phagocytised by macrophages
and digested in intracellular vacuoles.
Heart
Our observations agree with a previous report on heart
development [65]. Briefly, in the buds of B. schlosseri the
heart originates from a ventral vesicle, which forms from
mesenchymal cells that invaginate along the dorsal lamina to form the myocardium (stage 4). The first regular
heart beat characterises the transition of bud to stage 8,
from which point a strong signal of BsMA2 expression is
first recognisable (Figure 4M), limited to the cytoplasm of
cardiac cells in the developing myocardium. This is maintained until zooid regression.
In situ hybridisation in larval muscle
Antisense RNA probes for BsMA2 and BsTnT-c were tested
in late embryos and larvae in order to verify if the two
genes were expressed in musculature also during embryo-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/9/48

genesis. Sections containing both the cephalenteron and
tail of specimens at different stage show that transcripts of
BsTnT-c are never detectable (Figure 4N). Also transcripts
of BsMA2 are not detectable at the level of the caudal striated muscle. However, the BsMA2 probe gives strong signal at the oral siphon level where it labels mesenchymal
cells, some of them dispersed in the branchial area, but
most aggregated around the ectoderm of the rudiment of
oral siphon (Figure 4O).

Discussion
Previous research has shown that the unstriated muscle of
adult ascidians possesses intermediate features between
the striated and smooth muscles of vertebrates; it has
multinucleate cells [17] and a contractile regulatory system based on the Tn/Tm apparatus similar to vertebrate
striated muscle [15,16], but also lacks sarcomeric periodicity and regular spatial organisation of myofilaments,
similar to vertebrate smooth muscle. From a developmental point of view, it is interesting to note that unstriated
muscle differentiation in ascidians is associated with the
formation of sessile zooids that occurs through metamorphic events, in the oozooid, or asexual reproduction in all
the blastozooids.
During their life cycle ascidians also develop striated muscle in the tail of the free-swimming larvae and in the myocardium of adults. This has typical characteristics of the
vertebrate striated muscles, such as the arrangement and
the ratio of the myofilaments in the myofibrils (see
[13,67]). The study of the different musculatures during
the complete cycle of a colonial ascidian can be of interest
from developmental and evolutionary perspectives, especially considering that the tunicates are the closest group
(taxon) to vertebrates [68]. In this light, our study on B.
schlosseri muscle allows us to better analyse the development and organisation of this system. In particular, we
aimed to characterise two main genes (actin and TnT),
whose expression patterns were investigated in the larva
and during the life cycle of the blastozooids forming the
colony. Moreover, our data contribute to a better understanding of the evolution and maintenance of the different muscle types in the chordate group.
Actins
Our analyses confirm that actin genes are extremely well
conserved in metazoans, with most variability confined to
N-terminal region, that remains the most distinct feature
amongst different actin isoforms and is exposed on the
surface of the protein monomers [69]. CAs and MAs are
distinguishable by the presence of residues at specific
positions, and by a series of acidic amino acids involved
in the interaction with myosin in the muscular actins [70].

Some ascidians, such as C. intestinalis [34] and Molgula
oculata [GenBank: AAC28358, AAC28356], are known to
Page 10 of 15

BMC Developmental Biology 2009, 9:48

possess different CA genes; accordingly, it is possible that
B. schlosseri possesses other genes coding for CAs.
As demonstrated by our ISH experiments, BsMA2 is
expressed in both unstriated and cardiac musculature of
B. schlosseri blastozooids and in the presumptive adult
muscle, but not in the striated musculature of the larva.
The alignment of the amino acid sequences shows that
ascidian larval and adult MAs are very similar to the MAs
of vertebrates. The two different ascidian MAs are well
resolved from each other and belong to a well-defined
group of chordate MAs. This suggests there was a single
common ancestral gene in the chordate common ancestor
from which evolved all the different MAs of the phylum.
The intron pattern of BsMA2 could be found in other
ascidian MA2s and the position of the first intron seems
to be conserved from vertebrate to echinoderm actin
genes, apart for ascidian larval and amphioxus muscle
forms (additional file 2). All the examined tunicate muscle actins do not exhibit the specific intron at position
328/329 which characterises the vertebrate forms, and it
could be hypothesised that this intron was acquired during vertebrate evolution.
Our analysis on actin intron-exon organisation fits Kusakabe and collaborators' [35] depiction of a conserved deuterostome actin intron pattern, some of which are also
present in protostomes (which have between zero and
seven introns).
The intron positions of BsCA1 share the same pattern
found in other ascidian CAs, such as HrCA1 (additional
file 2). Two ascidian introns (150 and 204) are shared
with the vertebrate muscle actins, but not with the cytoplasmic actins.
Troponin T
The most probable scenario pictured by our analysis, considering animal phylogeny [68,71,72], predicts an ancestral TnT gene in the bilaterian common ancestor from
which protostome and deuterostome TnTs evolved. In the
deuterostome lineage, ascidian and vertebrate TnT isoforms evolved separately from an ancestral chordate TnT
gene. The troponin T genes of vertebrates are normally
involved in several splicing phenomena that result in a
number of isoforms characterising different tissues or
developmental stages. Our phylogenetic analysis confirms
that the vertebrate TnT gene family arose by gene duplications within the vertebrate lineage and, at least in vertebrates, there is a similarity between TnT isoforms of the
same muscle type in different species greater than between
isoforms of different muscle types in the same species
[34,73]. This "tissue-specific TnT isoforms homology"

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/9/48

hypothesis could be also extended to ascidians as BsTnT-c
is closely related to the adult isoform of H. roretzi, but
more information is needed from other tunicate species to
confirm this.
It has been shown that one TnT gene encodes for a specific
larval and another for a body-wall muscle form in H.
roretzi, while in C. intestinalis one gene codes for three isoforms, which are expressed respectively in the larva, heart
and adult body-wall muscle [34,60]. In our study, we
found that the expression of the BsTnT-c transcript is
detected only in the body-wall musculature of zooids,
without any signal at the myocardial level. We hypothesise that B. schlosseri possesses a different isoform
expressed only in the heart muscle and probably the same
situation is present in H. roretzi, in which only a form was
isolated from the body-wall muscle [60].
General Morphology
The study with phalloidin was successful in revealing the
general organisation of the body-wall muscle in the blastozooids of B. schlosseri and, interestingly, a strict correspondence was found between the time of appearance
and morphology of the muscle and the expression of the
two investigated genes.

The muscle system of B. schlosseri follows the general
organisation reported in other ascidians (see [67]). As
expected, muscles concentrate in the mantle around the
siphons where they are organised in a net of circular and
longitudinal bands that are extended mainly along the
dorso-lateral mantle. No muscle was observed in the
branchia and gut, where food movement is caused by ciliary beating [74]. However, two bands run along the dorsal lamina penetrating the recto-oesophageal trabecula to
reach the atrial siphon. They take part in the general contraction of the body. Tentacles of the oral siphon lack
musculature and their movement depends on blood pressure. They expose the coronal organ with mechanosensory
cells participating in the regulation of muscle activity to
control the water flow through the body [63,75]. The general layout of the muscle innervation, described in detail
in B. schlosseri buds [76], has shown that motor axons run
out from cell bodies in the brain to the developing muscles of the zooid. However, excitation can extend to contiguous zooids and it was proposed that coordination of
cardiac and body-wall muscle contractions in the zooids
of the same colony can be achieved by electric impulses
propagated through epithelial cells lining the body and
the blood vessels in the tunic [77]. Heart beating begins
early in the bud, before differentiation of the other organs
[65] and continues also during take-over and regression of
organs, in order to guarantee blood circulation for the distribution of tissue residuals in the entire colony.

With our original protocol for ISH on sections of B. schlosseri colonies and larvae, we recognised the structures
expressing BsMA2 and BsTnT-c. At the same time these
structures were analysed by means of cytochemical and
ultrastructural techniques. This integrated study on muscle organisation allowed us to characterise the series of
events for muscle appearance, differentiation and regression during the entire blastogenetic cycle and to recognise
several critical differences between unstriated muscle and
striated cardiac and larval musculature. During differentiation, we found that the mRNAs for BsMA2 and BsTnT-c
were synthesised by cells a short time before their translation into proteins and that the first myoblasts could be
revealed by different techniques (fluorescence, TEM, ISH)
in the mantle around the rudiment of siphons. Phalloidin
gave a diffuse light signal, whereas TEM recognised differentiating myoblasts among mesenchymal cells adhering
to epithelia, thanks to the appearance of aggregating myofilaments in their cytoplasm. This recalls what Sugino et
al. [78] observed in the siphons of the buds of another
stolidobranch, Simplegma reptans. We showed that, in B.
schlosseri, the probes for BsMA2 and BsTnT-c stained earlier
and exactly the differentiating cells, in agreement with the
idea that the probes specifically localise expressed
mRNAs, whereas TEM and phalloidin recognise actin after
polymerisation. Thus, the signal of phalloidin marks specifically the muscle only when a great number of thin filaments form fibres. Differently, when the zooids
approached regression and shrank, muscle activity (with
the exception of the heart) decreased markedly and
stopped. In correspondence to these events, as previously
reported by Burighel and Schiavinato [66], we showed
that the disorganisation of muscle was accompanied by
morphological alteration of cells with formation of cytoplasmic protrusions containing organelles. At the same
time the two investigated muscle genes underwent a progressive reduction of transcript levels, as revealed by the
decrease of the intensity of their expression signal with
ISH.
Notably, both the probes do not label the striated muscle
of the larva. This could suggest that different isoforms
were expressed in the larval caudal muscle. However, a
strong signal was recognised in the larva, due to the differentiating unstriated muscle in the rudiment of the siphon.
In the solitary ascidian C. intestinalis no signal at this level
was detected possibly due to a heterochronic difference in
siphon development, because the embryonic life of C.
intestinalis extends for 18 h, while the B. schlosseri embryo
develops for 5 days in the atrial cavity of mother, thus its
larva has more developed adult structures [67].
In cardiac, striated in the larval tail and unstriated in the
adult body-wall muscle types of B. schlosseri we have
found, respectively, three different combinations of the
MA and TnT expression: BsMA2+/BsTnT-c-, BsMA2-/

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/9/48

BsTnT-c- and BsMA2+/BsTnT-c+. This indicates that the
three ascidian muscle types differ not only "ultrastructurally", but also in the combinations of the subtype of the
molecules that compose them.

Conclusion
Common and divergent pathways in alternative developmental processes are an intriguing issue in evolutionary
and developmental biology research (see [38] for review
in ascidians), and this work adds an element in this field
as our data indicate a putative common pathway between
embryogenesis and blastogenesis in unstriated adult
body-wall muscle of ascidians, which also displays a similar organisation in both solitary and colonial ascidians
[see also [67]].
Our data agree with the idea that the smooth muscle of
vertebrates does not derive directly from the unstriated
muscle of ascidians, but from a striated muscle possessed
by the ancestor of vertebrates [24]. Indeed, the body-wall
muscle of ascidians possesses intermediate aspects
between striated (e.g. multinucleate fibres, a troponin regulatory system and expression of MyoD-like transcription
factors, nicotinic-type acetylcholine receptors-cholinergic) and smooth (absence of sarcomeric organisation)
muscle of vertebrates [[10,20] and [23]]. This supports the
idea that it derived from the striated muscle of the chordate ancestor, as an adaptation to the sessile life-style
which requires slow contractions for fine regulation of
water flow throughout the body and extended, rapid
retraction (till 50% of length) of the body for defensive
activities [24,67].
Tunicates show high muscle plasticity in that, besides the
three kinds of muscles described in ascidians, they can
also form other muscle types. Among thaliaceans (except
for pyrosomids that possess an unstriated muscle similar
to body-wall muscle of ascidians), doliolids and salps
show unusual muscle bands encircling their bodies. Both
taxa lack a T system, but salps have multinucleated striated muscle endowed with an extensive sarcoplasmic
reticulum [79,80], whereas doliolids, capable of
extremely rapid movements, possess obliquely striated
muscle with no or scarce sarcoplasmic reticulum [81].
Moreover, the appendicularian Oikopleura longicauda has a
typical caudal striated muscle with specific characters:
muscle cell differentiation proceeds throughout a first
mononucleated phase, (recalling the definitive larval
muscle of ascidians), then followed by division of the
nuclei and formation of a multinucleated musculature, in
contrast with cell fusion that typically characterises vertebrate skeletal muscle [82,83]. In addition, at the molecular level, the actin sequence of appendicularians possesses
intermediate features between the two ascidian types [82].

The characteristics and plasticity of tunicate muscle, possibly derived from an original striated muscle, together
with the position in phylogenetic tree of actin and troponin ascidian genes, agree with the recent view that not
cephalochordates, but ascidians are the sister group of vertebrates [68]. At the same time, in the light of the actual
debate on the sessile or motile nature of chordate ancestor
[84], all the above considerations agree with the idea that
a motile animal possessing the genetic machinery for differentiation of the typical chordate striated muscle was the
common chordate ancestor, from which the tunicates
originated and evolved their variety of muscles.
