The potential importance of HLA-C CD8+ specific
responses in control of HIV replication is still unknown
and controversial. Many known CTLs are restricted by
HLA-A or HLA-B but only a small number are restricted by
HLA-C. This study examines the impact on HIV-1
immune escape and viral fitness of a CTL response
restricted by HLA-Cw*0303/0304 (YL9) in a very conserved region of HIV Gag p24.

sion of Cw*0303/0304 and changes at the C-terminal of
the epitope YVDRFFKTL 296–304 (YL9) from Thr-303 to
Val, Ile and Ala with (p = 1.62 × 10-10). In addition,
changes T303I and T303A in YL9 decrease epitope avidity
by 5-fold and show a significant reduction of replicative
capacity. However, the selection of T303V restores viral
fitness and in vitro recognition. Clonal analysis suggests
the mutational pathway of T303V selection through WT
and T303A intermediates.

Methods

Conclusion

HIV CD8+ specific responses to a panel of overlapping
peptides (OLP) were measured by INF-γ ELISPOT and HIV
Gag sequences were obtained from HLA-Cw*0303/0304
subjects with chronic HIV infection (n = 80). The avidity
of RI9 responses was measured by IFN-γ Elispot assay to
serial diluted peptides for each variant (T303V, T303I,
T303A). Plasmids containing YL9 mutations were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. Viral replication
kinetics were measured by GFP expression. DNA from a
patient with T303V was amplified by PCR and cloned into
pGEM. Gag proviral clones were analyzed and phylogenetic analysis carried out.

These studies demonstrate that HLA-Cw*0303/0304 YL9
CTL responses targeting p24 can drive viral immune
escape and changes in viral replication to similar extent to
other HLA-B described responses. This data highlight the
importance to define relevant HLA-C responses that drive
HIV evolution and impact in viral fitness.

Background

Results
60% of Cw*0303/0304 HIV individuals have a pattern of
Gag recognition focus on OLPs containing the YL9
epitope. There is a strong association between the expresPage 1 of 1
