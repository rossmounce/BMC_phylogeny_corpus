Abstract
Background: The vast sequence divergence among different virus groups has presented a great challenge to
alignment-based analysis of virus phylogeny. Due to the problems caused by the uncertainty in alignment, existing
tools for phylogenetic analysis based on multiple alignment could not be directly applied to the whole-genome
comparison and phylogenomic studies of viruses. There has been a growing interest in alignment-free methods for
phylogenetic analysis using complete genome data. Among the alignment-free methods, a dynamical language (DL)
method proposed by our group has successfully been applied to the phylogenetic analysis of bacteria and chloroplast
genomes.
Results: In this paper, the DL method is used to analyze the whole-proteome phylogeny of 124 large dsDNA viruses
and 30 parvoviruses, two data sets with large difference in genome size. The trees from our analyses are in good
agreement to the latest classification of large dsDNA viruses and parvoviruses by the International Committee on
Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV).
Conclusions: The present method provides a new way for recovering the phylogeny of large dsDNA viruses and
parvoviruses, and also some insights on the affiliation of a number of unclassified viruses. In comparison, some
alignment-free methods such as the CV Tree method can be used for recovering the phylogeny of large dsDNA viruses,
but they are not suitable for resolving the phylogeny of parvoviruses with a much smaller genome size.
Background
Viruses were traditionally characterized by morphological features (capsid size, shape, structure, etc) and physicochemical and antigenic properties [1]. At the DNA level,
the evolutionary relationships of many families and genera have been explored by sequence analysis of single
gene or gene families, such as polymerase, capsid and
movement genes [1]. The International Committee on
the Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) publishes a report on
the virus taxonomy system every five years. Phylogenetic
and taxonomic studies of viruses based on complete
genome data have become increasingly important as
more and more whole viral genomes are sequenced [2-6]

The phylogeny based on single genes or gene families
contains ambiguity because horizontal gene transfer
(HGT), along with gene duplication and gene capture
from hosts, appear to be frequent in large DNA viruses
[7-10]. Whether single-gene based analysis can properly
infer viral species phylogeny is debatable [2]. One of the
unusual aspects of viral genomes is that they exhibit high
sequence divergence [7,11]. Several works have
attempted to infer viral phylogeny from their whole
genomes [1,2,4,8,12-19]. Among these studies of genome
trees, the alignment-free methods proposed by Gao and
Qi [1], Wu et al [2], Gao et al [12] and Stuart et al [16]
seem to be sufficiently powerful to resolve the phylogeny
of viruses at large evolutionary distance. The present
study represents another effort of applying an alignmentfree method in analysing complete genome data to eluci-

date the phylogeny of two virus groups of different
genome size, the large dsDNA viruses and parvoviruses.
The DNA of DNA viruses is usually double-stranded
(dsDNA), but may also be single-stranded (ssDNA).
According to the VIIIth Report of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) [20], the dsDNA
viruses can be classified into certain families or unassigned genus. The genome sizes of dsDNA viruses are
usually larger than 10 kb except those in the families Polyomaviridae (5 kb) and Papillomaviridae (7-8 kb). On the
other hand, the genome sizes of ssDNA viruses are
smaller than 10 kb. The parvoviruses constitute a family
established in 1970 to encompass all small non-enveloped
viruses with approximately 5 kb linear, self-priming,
ssDNA genomes [21,22]. According to the VIIIth Report
of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses
(ICTV) [20], this family is separated into two subfamilies,
Parvovirinae and Densovirinae. Viruses in the subfamily
Parvovirinae infect vertebrates and vertebrate cell cultures, and frequently associate with other viruses, while
those in the subfamily Densovirinae infect arthropods or
other invertebrates [23,24]. Dependovirus requires coinfection with herpes or adenovirus for replication and is
not itself pathogenic [22]. Due to the fatal nature of infection with densoviruses on their respective species, it has
been suggested that densoviruses may represent suitable
vectors for insect control [24,25]. The regions of identity
and similarity between genomes of human and rodent
parvoviruses and their respective hosts have been studied
[26]. More features of parvoviruses can be found in the
reviews by Tattersall and Cotmore [22].
The whole genome sequences are generally accepted as
excellent tools for studying evolution [27]. On the basis of
characters used to cluster genomes, Snel et al [28]
reviewed that genome trees can be globally divided into
five classes: alignment-free genome trees based on statistic properties of the complete genome, gene content trees
based on the presence and absence of genes, genome
trees based on chromosomal gene order, genome trees
based on average sequence similarity, and phylogenomic
trees based either on the collection of phylogenetic trees
derived from shared gene families or on a concatenated
alignment of those families. Due to the problems caused
by the uncertainty in alignment [29], existing tools for
phylogenetic analysis based on multiple alignment could
not be directly applied to the whole-genome comparison
and phylogenomic studies. There has been a growing
interest in alignment-free methods for phylogenetic analysis using complete genome data [2,30,31]. Recently Jun
et al [32] used an alignment-free method, the feature frequency profiles of whole proteomes, to construct a
whole-proteome phylogeny of 884 prokaryotes and 16
unicellular eukaryotes. In their whole-proteome trees,
Archaea, Eubacteria and Eukarya are clearly separated.

Page 2 of 11

Similarly, the analyses based on dynamical language (DL)
model [33] and Markov model [34] without sequence
alignment using 103 prokaryotes and six eukaryotes have
yielded trees separating the three domains of life with the
relationships among the taxa consistent with those based
on traditional analyses. These two methods were also
used to analyze the complete chloroplast genomes
[33,35]. The CV Tree method [34] was recently used to
analyze the fungal phylogeny [36]. A simplified version
based on the CV Tree method was used to analyze gene
sequencesfor the purpose of DNA barcoding [37,38].
Zheng et al [39] proposed a complexity-based measure
for phylogenetic analysis. Guyon et al [40] compared four
alignment-free string distances for complete genome
phylogeny using 62 α-proteobacteria. The four distances
are Maximum Significant Matches (MSM) distance, Kword (KW) or K-mer distance (i.e. the CV Tree method
[33]), Average Common Substring (ACS) distance and
Compression (ZL) distance. The results showed that the
MSM distance outperforms the other three distances and
the CV Tree method cannot give good phylogenetic
topology for the 62 α-proteobacteria. We recently modified our dynamical language (DL) method [33] by replacing the correlation distance (pseudo-distance) by the
chord distance (a proper distance in the strict mathematical sense) and proposed a way to select the optimal feature length based on average relative difference analysis
[41]. Testing the modified DL method on the data sets
used in previous studies [33,34,40], we found that this
method can give very good phylogenetic topologies [41],
while the CV tree method cannot give good phylogenetic
topology for the 62 α-proteobacteria [40]. In the present
paper, we adopt the DL method [33] to analyze a large
number of genomes of the large dsDNA viruses and parvoviruses.

Results and Discussion
The whole DNA sequences, all protein-coding DNA
sequences and all protein sequences from complete
genomes of the selected 124 large dsDNA viruses and 30
selected parvoviruses were analyzed. The trees of K = 3 to
6 based on all protein sequences and the trees of K ≤ 13
based on the whole DNA sequences and all protein-coding DNA sequences using the DL method [33] were constructed. After comparing all the trees constructed by the
present method with the classification of the 124 large
dsDNA viruses and 30 parvoviruses given in the VIIIth
Report of ICTV [23], we found that the trees for large
dsDNA viruses and parvoviruses based on all protein
sequences are better than those based on all protein-coding DNA sequences and the whole DNA sequences. Furthermore, for the phylogenetic trees of 124 large dsDNA
viruses based on all protein sequences, the tree of K = 5
provides the best result among the cases of K = 3 to 6. We
show this tree in Figure 1. The trees for K = 4 and 6 are
similar to but a little bit inferior to the tree for K = 5. The
bootstrap consensus trees for the four big groups (Adenoviridae, Baculoviridae, Herpesviridae and Poxviridae)
(Figure 2) provide branch statistics for the tree in Figure
1. For the trees of 30 parvoviruses based on all protein
sequences, the trees for K = 4 and 6 are topologically
identical, and are the best trees among the cases of K = 3
to 6. We show the tree for K = 4 in Figure 3. The tree for K
= 5 is similar to but a little bit worse than the trees for K =

4 and 6. Figure 4 shows the bootstrap consensus tree of
Figure 3. The distance matrices generated from our analyses are available from the first author via email

. We found that the DL method [33] and the modified DL
method [41] give trees of the same topology for the same
K for both data sets.
As given in Figure 1, despite numerous horizontal gene
transfers among large dsDNA viruses [9], our analysis can
divide the 124 dsDNA viruses into nine families correctly.
Our phylogenetic relationships of all 124 large dsDNA
viruses are in good agreement with the latest classification in the VIIIth Report of the International Committee
on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) [20]. In the family Adenoviridae, Figures 1 and 2a support the division of this

family into four genera Atadenovirus, Aviadenovirus,
Mastadenovirus and Siadenovirus. All viruses in these
four genera are grouped correctly. The topology of phylogeny for these four genera is identical to that shown in
Figure one of [1] which supports the hypothesis that
interspecies transmission, i.e. host switches of adenoviruses, may have occurred [42]. In Figures 1 and 2b, the
family Baculoviridae is divided into two genera Granulovirus and Nucleopolyhedrovirus. All viruses in these two
genera are classified correctly. The unclassified virus
NeleNPV in this family groups with NeseNPV which
belongs to genus Nucleopolyhedrovirus. So our result
supports grouping virus NeleNPV to genus Nucleopolyhedrovirus. Another unclassified virus CuniNPV is
located at the basal position of this family, as reported by

Chordopoxvirinae and Entomopoxvirinae shown in Figures 1 and 2d is the same as in the VIIIth Report of ICTV.
In the subfamily Chordopoxvirinae, the viruses in the
genera Avipoxvirus, Capripoxvirus, Leporipoxvirus, Molluscipoxvirus, Orthopoxvirus, Parapoxvirus, Suipoxvirus
and Yatapoxvirus group together correctly. The unclassified virus DPV is closely related to the genera Capripoxvirus and Suipoxvirus, so that our result supports
assigning the virus DPV to the subfamily Chordopoxvirinae, in agreement with the results in [1] and [45]. In the
subfamily Entomopoxvirinae, the viruses in genus
Betaentomopoxvirus group together as expected. The
division of the family Herpesviridae into subfamilies
Alphaherpesvirinae, Gammaherpesvirinae and Betaherpesvirinae is clear. All viruses in the genera within each
subfamily are grouped correctly in Figures 1 and 2c. Consistent with the result of [1], our tree supports assigning
the unclassified virus TuHV_1 in the subfamily Betaherpesvirinae to genus Cytomegalovirus. The unclassified
Herpesviridae virus OsHV_1 groups with IcHV_1 indicating that we can assign it to the genus Ictalurivirus. The
unclassified Herpesviridae virus PsHV_1 groups with

replicates. Modified bootstrap percentages <100% are shown (other
branches are 100% supported).

GaHV_1, suggesting its affiliation to the genus Iltovirus.
The unclassified Herpesviridae virus AtHV_3 nests
inside the branch of genus Rhadinovirus, which indicates
we can assign it to the genus Rhadinovirus. All viruses in
the family Iridoviridae fall into their genera correctly in
Figure 1. The grouping of the unclassified virus HZV_1
with WSSV indicates its affiliation to the genus Whispovirus in the family Nimaviridae. The viruses in family
Phycodnaviridae group together as expected. The virus
APMiV of the genus Mimivirus but with no family affiliation nests within the family Phycodnaviridae suggests
classification of the genus to this family. The viruses in
the family Polydnaviridae cluster together correctly. As
claimed by Gao and Qi [1], our results could also provide
some clues to the hypotheses on the origins and evolution
of viruses of several families. Overall, the topology of our
tree is similar to that of the tree in [1] and our tree is
slightly better because the tree in [1]has 4 outliers (CuniNPV, IIV_6, IcHV_1 and OsHV_1) while ours has no outlier. Although the results using feature frequency profiles

(FFPs) on a slightly larger data set showed the FFP
method can also resolve the phylogeny of large dsDNA
viruses [2], the optimal feature length for FFP method is 8
implying that much longer computing time and larger
computer space are needed as compared to our method
with an optimal feature length of 5.
As shown in Figures 3 and 4, our analyses showed that
the parvovirus genomes are separated into two major
groups, with one group corresponding to the subfamily
Parvovirinae and the other group corresponding to the
subfamily Densovirinae. In the Parvovirinae group, the
parvoviruses in the genera Parvovirus, Erythrovirus,
Dependovirus, Amdovirus and Bocavirus group together
as subgroups respectively. In the Densovirinae group, the
parvoviruses in the genera Densovirus, Iteravirus and
Brevidensovirus cluster together as subgroups correctly.
All the groups and subgroups shown in Figure 3 using our
method agree well with the latest classification of parvoviruses given in the VIIIth Report of ICTV [20] except
PfDNV. PfDNV was classified into the Brevidensovirus in
the VIIth Report of the ICTV [23] and reclassified into
Pefudensovirus in the VIIIth Report of ICTV [20]. After
the comparison on the genome structure, coding protein
sequence homology, DNA sequence homology, 3-dimensional structure [46,47] between PfDNV and other parvoviruses, Li et al [48] claimed that it would be more
appropriate to classify pfDNV as Densovirus rather than
Brevidensovirus. Thus the grouping of PfDNV with Densoviru in our tree (Figures 3 and 4) provides another piece
of evidence for classifying PfDNV as Densovirus.
Amdovirus and Bocavirus are newly defined genera in the
subfamily Parvoririnae in the VIIIth Report of ICTV [20].
In the VIIth Report of ICTV [23], the parvoviruses
(AMDV and MVC) in these two new genera were
grouped under Parvovirus. Their close relationship is also
reflected in our trees (Figures 3 and 4) in which Amdovirus and Bocavirus cluster with Parvovirus as a separate
branch. The parvoviruses AAV7, AAV8, AAAVa, BPV2,
MPV, AdDNV and CeDNV are still not classified in the
VIIIth Report of ICTV [20]. In our previous study [33],
the DL method applied to the analysis of 103 prokaryotes
and six eukaryotes has yielded trees separating the three
domains of life, Archaea, Eubacteria and Eukarya with
the relationships among the taxa in good agreement with
those based on traditional analyses. It has also been
applied in analyzing the chloroplast genomes [33] to give
reliable phylogenies of plants and algae. From the above
discussion, it is clear that this method can successfully
resolve the phylogeny of parvoviruses. The positions of
AAV7, AAV8, AAAVa, BPV2, MPV, AdDNV and CeDNV
in Figure 3 provide new insights on their classification.
It is very interesting to note the assumption that small
DNA viruses (genome size <10 kb) probably have different evolutionary history as compared to large DNA

Page 8 of 11

viruses [9,49]. Our analyses showed that the DL method
can be used to reconstruct the phylogeny of viruses with
large difference in genome size (larger than 10 kb for
large dsDNA viruses and less than 10 kb for parvoviruses). We also generated all the trees of the same K values based on the three kinds of sequences for the
parvovirus data set 2 using the CV Tree method [34]. Yet
no tree generated by the CV Tree method can clearly distinguish the subfamilies Parvovirinae and Densovirinae
of parvoviruses. So for the data set of parvoviruses, the
DL method is superior (from the biological point of view)
to the CV Tree method in phylogenetic inference.
Our approach is faster than the traditional approaches
of phylogenetic analysis, particularly when dealing with a
large number of genomes. Moreover, since multiple
sequence alignment is not necessary, the intrinsic problems associated with this complex procedure can be
avoided. Our method may provide a quick reference on
virus phylogeny and a fast analysis of co-evolution of
viruses and their hosts when their proteomes are available [1,50].

Conclusions
Using the DL method, we have studied the molecular
phylogeny between families of large dsDNA viruses and
parvoviruses. The present method provides a new way
for recovering the phylogeny of large dsDNA viruses and
parvoviruses, and also insights on the affiliation of some
unclassified viruses and relationships among some families. It appears that some alignment-free methods such as
the CV Tree method [34] can be used for recovering the
phylogeny of large dsDNA viruses, but they are not suitable for parvoviruses with a much smaller genome size.
Methods
In this paper, three kinds of data from the complete
genomes of large dsDNA viruses and parvoviruses are
analysed using the DL method proposed by our group
[33]. They are the whole DNA sequences (including protein-coding and non-coding regions), all protein-coding
DNA sequences and the amino acid sequences of all protein-coding genes.
There are a total of N = 4K(for DNA sequences) or
20K(for protein sequences) possible types of K-mers (the
strings with fixed length K). We denote the length of a
DNA or protein sequence as L. Then a window of length
K is used to slide through the sequences by shifting one
position at a time to determine the frequencies of each of
the N kinds of K-mers in this sequence. We define
p(α1α2...αK) = n(α1α2...αK)/(L - K + 1) as the observed frequency of a K-mer α1α2...αK, where n(α1α2...αK) is the
number of times that α1α2...αK appears in this sequence.
For the DNA or amino acid sequences of the protein-cod-

ing genes, denoting by m the number of protein-coding
genes from each complete genome, we define
(∑ j =1 n j (a 1a 2 ...a K )) / (∑ j =1 (L j − K + 1))
m

m

as

the

observed frequency of a K-mer α1α2...αK; here nj(α1α2...αK)
means the number of times that α1α2...αK appears in the
jth protein-coding DNA sequence or protein sequence,
and Lj the length of the jth sequence in this complete
genome. Then we can form a composition vector for a
genome using p(α1α2...αK) as components for all possible
K-mers α1α2...αK. We use pi to denote the i-th component
corresponding to the mer type i, i = 1,..., N (N mers are
arranged in a fixed order as the alphabetical order). In
this way we construct a composition vector p = (p1, p2,...,
pN) for a genome.
Yu et al [33] considered an idea from the theory of
dynamical language that a K-mer s1s2...sK is possibly constructed by adding a letter sK to the end of the (K-1) -mer
s1s2...sK-1or a letter s1 to the beginning of the (K-1)-mer
s2s3...sK. After counting the observed frequencies for all
(K-1)-mers and the four or 20 kinds of letters, the
expected frequency of appearance of K-mers is predicted
by
q( s 1 s 2 ... s K ) =

p( s1s 2...s K −1)p( s K )+ p( s1)p( s 2 s 3...s K )
,
2

where p(s1) and p(sK)are frequencies of nucleotides or
amino acids s1and sK appearing in this genome. Then
q(s1s2...sK) of all 4K or 20KK-mers is viewed as the noise
background. We then subtract the noise background by
defining
⎧ p( s1s 2 ...s K ) / q( s1s 2 ...s K ) − 1, if

X( s1s 2 ...s K ) = ⎨

⎩

0, if

q( s1s 2 ...s K ) ≠ 0,

q( s1s 2 ...s K ) = 0.

The transformation X = (p/q)-1 has the desired effect of
subtraction of random background in p and rendering it a
stationary time series suitable for subsequent cross-correlation analysis. X can also be regarded as the relative
difference between p and q.
Then we use X(s1s2...sK) for all possible K-mers s1s2...sK
as components and arrange them according to a fixed
alphabetical order to form a composition vector X =
(X1,X2,...,XN) for genome X, and likewise Y = (Y1,Y2,...,YN)
for genome Y.
Then we view the N components in the vectors X and Y
as samples of these two random variables respectively.
The sample correlation C(X, Y) between any two
genomes X and Yis defined in the usual way. The dissimilarity D(X, Y) between the two genomes is then defined

by D(X, Y) = (1 - C(X, Y))/2. A dissimilarity matrix for all
the genomes under study is then generated for the construction of phylogenetic trees. This method to construct
phylogenetic tree is referred to as the dynamical language
(DL) method [33].
Finally, for convenience to compare the results with
those of the previous works, based on the distance matrices, we construct all trees for data sets 1 and 2 using the
neighbour-joining (NJ) method [51] in the softwares
Phylip [52] (version 3.66) and SplitsTree4 [51] (version
4.10).
Robustness test of the trees using modified version of the
bootstrap method [2]

In order to estimate the robustness of tree topology, Qi et
al [34] proposed a bootstrap method by resampling on
the genes or translated proteins on the genome (this
method was also used by Wang et al [36]). Wu et al [2]
proposed a modified bootstrap method by resampling the
frequencies of all K-mers. The method of Qi et al. [34] is
not applicable to the virus genomes as almost all virus
genomes have only a few genes and it is statistically
meaningless to resample such a small number of genes.
So we use the modified bootstrap method proposed by
Wu et al [2] which works as follows. A table is first constructed with each row being the composition vector representing a genome and each column representing the
frequencies of a fixed K-mer in different genomes. The
bootstrap is applied to the columns of the table except
those are redrawn [2]. Thus, the resampled table has
fewer columns but each K-mer maintains the same frequency as in the original table. Because it is allowed that
some positions could be redrawn more than once in the
traditional bootstrap analyses with sequence alignment
[53], we believe it is more reasonable to allow that some
columns to be redrawn more than once, giving the resampled table with the same number of columns as the original table in the modified bootstrap method. Then a
distance matrix can be obtained based on the resampled
table.
