T-RFPred: a nucleotide sequence size prediction
tool for microbial community description based
on terminal-restriction fragment length
polymorphism chromatograms
Antonio Fernàndez-Guerra1*, Alison Buchan2, Xiaozhen Mou3, Emilio O Casamayor1, José M González4

Abstract
Background: Terminal-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (T-RFLP) is a technique used to analyze
complex microbial communities. It allows for the quantification of unique or numerically dominant phylotypes in
amplicon pools and it has been used primarily for comparisons between different communities. T-RFPred,
Terminal-Restriction Fragment Prediction, was developed to identify and assign taxonomic information to
chromatogram peaks of a T-RFLP fingerprint for a more comprehensive description of microbial communities. The
program estimates the expected fragment size of representative 16S rRNA gene sequences (either from a
complementary clone library or from public databases) for a given primer and restriction enzyme(s) and provides
candidate taxonomic assignments.
Results: To show the accuracy of the program, T-RFLP profiles of a marine bacterial community were described
using artificial bacterioplankton clone libraries of sequences obtained from public databases. For all valid
chromatogram peaks, a phylogenetic group could be assigned.
Conclusions: T-RFPred offers enhanced functionality of T-RFLP profile analysis over current available programs. In
particular, it circumvents the need for full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences during taxonomic assignments of T-RF
peaks. Thus, large 16S rRNA gene datasets from environmental studies, including metagenomes, or public
databases can be used as the reference set. Furthermore, T-RFPred is useful in experimental design for the
selection of primers as well as the type and number of restriction enzymes that will yield informative
chromatograms from natural microbial communities.

Background
Terminal-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism
(T-RFLP) analysis of 16S rRNA gene amplicons is a rapid
fingerprinting method for characterization of microbial
communities [1,2]. It is based on the restriction endonuclease digestion profile of fluorescently end-labeled PCR
products. The digested products are separated by capillary gel electrophoresis, detected and registered on an
automated sequence analyzer. Each T-RF is represented
by a peak in the output chromatogram and corresponds
to members of the community that share a given

terminal fragment size. Peak area is proportional to the
abundance of the T-RF in the PCR amplicon pool, which
can be used as a proxy for relative abundance in natural
populations [3]. This method is rapid, relatively inexpensive and provides distinct profiles that reflect the taxonomic composition of sampled communities. Although
it has extensively been used for comparative purposes, a
T-RFLP fingerprint alone does not allow for conclusive
taxonomic identification of individual phylotypes because
it is technically challenging to recover terminal fragments
for direct sequencing. However, when coupled with
sequence data for representative 16S rRNA genes, T-RF
identification is feasible (e.g. [4-6]). Here we describe a
method to assign the T-RF peaks generated by T-RFLP
analysis with either 16S rRNA gene sequences obtained

from clone libraries of the same samples, metagenome
sequences or data from public 16S rRNA sequence databases. T-RFPred can thus be used to classify T-RFs from
T-RFLP profiles for which reference clone libraries are
not available, albeit with lower phylogenetic resolution,
by taking advantage of the wealth of 16S rRNA gene
sequence data available from metagenome studies and
public databases such as the Ribosomal Database Project
(RDP) [7] or SILVA [8]. Metagenome sequencing studies
from a variety of environments are accumulating at a
rapid pace. While most often partial gene sequences,
these libraries have the advantage that they are less subject to biases of other PCR-based techniques (see e.g. [9]
for a review) and, thus, can better represent the original
community structure. Furthermore, both metagenome
and pyrosequencing of tagged 16S rRNA gene amplicons
provides unprecedented coverage of 16S rRNA gene
diversity in specific environments. Therefore, these types
of datasets are valuable references when attempting to
taxonomically classify T-RF peaks from diverse microbial
communities.
Tools have been previously developed to perform in
silico digestions of 16S rRNA gene sequences and/or to
assign a taxonomic label to the chromatograms. Such
programs include TAP-TRFLP [10], MiCA [11], T-RFLP
Phylogenetic Assignment Tool (PAT; [12]), TReFID
[13], TRAMPR [14], an ARB-software integrated tool
[15] and TRiFLe [16]. Table 1 contains some of the
essential features of these packages. The most obvious
advantage of T-RFPred as compared with other available
software applications is that the program handles either
partial or full-length user input sequences. This is
because T-RFPred retrieves complete sequences of close

Page 2 of 7

relatives from the public databases for T-RF assignments
and at the same time it taxonomically bins the clone
sequences. Furthermore, it can use large sequence datasets of virtually any size as reference sets in taxonomic
assignments. T-RFPred is exclusive to 16S rRNA gene
sequences and designed to exploit the full potential of
T-RFLP profiles and their use in the description of prokaryotic communities.

Implementation
T-RFPred is coded in Perl and uses the BioPerl Toolkit
[17], fuzznuc from the EMBOSS package [18] and the
BLASTN program from the NCBI BLAST suite [19].
T-RFPred has been tested in Unix-like environments,
but runs in all the operating systems able to execute
Perl, BioPerl, BLAST and EMBOSS; a ready-to-use
VMware virtual image is also available for download at
http://nodens.ceab.csic.es/t-rfpred/.
An interactive shell guides the user through the multiple steps of the analysis. Users can choose to analyze
archaeal or bacterial sequences using either forward or
reverse primers. The primer search utilizes fuzznuc,
which allows the user to select the number of nucleotide
ambiguities. The program extracts a subset of sequences
from the RDP database that will supplement sequence
analysis of clone libraries. T-RFPred generates and
exports in a tab delimited text file: (1) the fragment
length for the RDP sequence with the best BLASTN hit
to the input sequence(s), (2) the estimated fragment
length for the input sequence, (3) the gap length for the
input sequence, (4) the percent identity between the
input sequence and the best hit RDP sequence and (5)
the taxonomic classification. The BLASTN search

sequence in the Ribosomal Database Project database by BLASTN.

results and the Smith-Waterman alignments [20] are
saved to allow the user to manually check the results.
Database

The program uses a custom version of the aligned RDP
as a flat file in FASTA format, where the header has
been modified to include the NCBI taxonomic information and the forward/reverse position of the first nongap character from the RDP alignment. T-RFPred
exploits the Bio::DB::Flat capabilities from BioPerl to
index the RDP flat file for the rapid retrieval of 16S
rRNA gene sequences. All restriction enzymes available
in REBase [21] are stored in a flat file and available for
use in the analysis. A list of frequently used forward and
reverse primers is available, although the user may also
input custom primers.
Algorithm

In part, the rationale for the described method was to
circumvent the need for full-length 16S rRNA gene
sequences from representative clone libraries. In addition to requiring multiple sequencing reactions, obtaining full-length sequences is generally complicated by the
ambiguous nature of the 5’ end of a sequence generated
by the Sanger approach (i.e. the first 10-30 bp of a
sequence are missing). When the same primer set used
to generate T-RFLP profiles is also used to generate
amplicons for libraries and directional sequencing of
representative clones, as is often the case, in silico predictions of expected peak sizes are cumbersome. Additionally, the size of the fragment is subject to
experimental error [22,23], which complicates the
assignment of chromatogram peaks to specific phylogenetic groups. T-RFPred takes advantage of the most
comprehensive database of 16S rRNA gene sequences
(the RDP) to identify the closest related sequences for
analysis to provide more definitive phylogenetic assignments of chromatogram peaks. Collectively, the Perl
scripts achieve the following steps:
1. Create a subset of all the sequences in the RDP
with nucleotide information spanning the region targeted by the fluorescently labeled primer and with a
length > 1200 nucleotides for Bacteria and > 900
nucleotides for Archaea.
2. Convert the subset created in Step 1 into a BLASTready database using formatdb. Conduct a BLASTN
search with the sample sequences (FASTA format)
against the RDP database and extract the best hits.
3. Determine if sample sequences have the denoted
restriction enzyme recognition site. If the cut site is present, proceed to Step 4. If the cut site is not present,
estimate the expected fragment size using the closest
RDP sequence and proceed to Step 5.

4. Generate a Smith-Waterman alignment of the sample sequence with the best hit from the RDP. This will
provide accurate percent identities and the start/end
positions of the alignment needed to estimate the fragment sizes.
5. Obtain the position of the restriction enzyme recognition site in the aligned sample sequence and the primer position in the RDP sequence. Use the RDP
sequence to calculate the number of nucleotides in the
gap between the primer and the start position of the
Smith-Waterman alignment as shown in Figure 1.
6. Assign a taxonomic classification using the best
RDP BLAST hit.

Results and Discussion
We have developed a computational method to provide
putative phylogenetic affinities of chromatogram peaks
of 16S rRNA gene T-RFLP profiles. Additional file 1,
Supplementary Tables S1-S3 show the typical output of
T-RFPred for the clone sequences from González et al.
[4], Mou et al. [5], and Pinhassi et al. [6], respectively.
The T-RFPred output provides the estimated fragment
size of the digested clone sequences as well as a user
defined number of closest relatives. This feature is valuable for estimating the conservation of the digested product size for a given enzyme and taxonomic group
analyzed.
T-RFPred was also evaluated by reanalyzing chromatogram peaks from T-RFLP profiles of marine communities described in González et al. [4]. Two 16S rRNA
datasets constructed from sequences from public databases, designated “4926” (4926 bacterioplankton Genbank sequences) and “GOS” (6370 Global Ocean
Sampling Expedition Microbial Metagenome sequences;
[24]), were analyzed with T-RFPred using three restriction enzymes (i.e., CfoI, HaeIII, and AluI). Details on
experimental procedure are described in the Additional
File 1. The two datasets and their predicted fragment
sizes and phylogenetic affiliations were used to taxonomically label the chromatogram peaks from natural samples (Figure 2). With very few exceptions, all valid
fragment peaks were properly identified and in good
agreement with the phylogenetic assignments reported
in the literature using complementary clone libraries
(Table 2). For instance, from the 4926 sequence dataset
analyzed with three restriction enzymes, 124 clones
yielded in silico digested fragment sizes matching peaks
labeled as “1” (previously identified as alphaproteobacteria of the Roseobacter clade) in Figure 2. Of these
clones, 90% (111 clones) were properly classified as
Roseobacter-related, seven were Alphaproteobacteria
outside the Roseobacter group, four Gammaproteobacteria, and two were Betaproteobacteria (Table 2). Thus,

Figure 1 Description of the method to estimate the length of the terminal-fragment size for partial 16S rRNA sequences. The closest
sequences (by homology search) in the RDP database are used to estimate the length of the fragment and its phylogenetic affiliation. The primer
sequence is fluorescently labeled and it is close to the 5’ end of the 16S rDNA gene. ‘Gap’ is the missing part of the sequence between the position
of the primer and the beginning of the sequence. The position of the target sequence determines the size of the terminal fragment.

these T-RFs were labeled as Roseobacter. Those peaks
labeled with a “2” (Figure 2) were mapped to members
of the SAR11 group as 119 of the 148 sequences (80%)
were from this lineage (Table 2). The chromatogram
peak assignments were less ambiguous when the GOS
dataset was used as the reference. With regards to TRFs labeled 1 and 2 in Figure 2, 95% of the sequences
belonged to the Roseobacter group and all (n = 269)
sequences belonged to the SAR11 group (Table 2).
Therefore, the GOS dataset was more representative of
the diversity of the bacterioplankton in the natural samples. This might be because that dataset was comprised
of sequences exclusively from surface seawater samples;

the T-RFLP profiles analyzed were also generated from
surface seawater.

Conclusions
T-RFLP is a popular method for analysis of microbial
communities and in silico automated methods are
needed to facilitate the taxonomic identification of T-RFs
in community profiles. Traditionally, computational
methods to analyze T-RFLP experiments follow one of
two approaches: (a) in silico simulation of the digestion
of reference sequences from databases to find the most
suitable enzymes that describes the microbial community
organization or (b) T-RF from experiments can be

designed to provide a list of candidate taxa that corresponds to the chromatogram peaks using a complementary reference clone library or public databases.
Depending upon the restriction enzyme used, broad phylogenetic groups can sometimes give the same fragment
size. Thus, we also determined that community profiles
generated with at least two different restriction enzymes
are needed for the most robust taxonomic identifications
(Table 2). The method has also its caveats as is not

species based upon terminal fragment length, particularly, as the identification of the sequences cannot be
solely determined based on the closest BLASTN hit
alone. Manual inspection of the BLASTN hits and additional efforts may also be needed for more conclusive
taxonomic assignments. In the example above, we conducted homology searches (BLASTN) to a set of reference sequences from representative taxa as well as
phylogenetic treeing methods to confirm the taxonomic
affiliations of the GOS and 4926 sequences whose predicted fragment sizes matched a chromatogram peaks
(data not shown). Despite these caveats, the position of
restriction enzyme recognition sites within the 16S
rDNA molecule does reflect a level of phylogeny and can
be used to help guide experimental design (i.e. which and
how many restriction enzymes are most appropriate for a
given community) so that the most reliable results for
the T-RFLP characterization of a given prokaryotic
assemblage can be obtained.
In summary, T-RFPred offers an alternative, freeware
and open source program for researchers using T-RFLP
to examine microbial populations. The program can help
researchers determine the most appropriate restriction
enzyme(s) to use when designing experiments to assess
community structure using the T-RFLP method. It can
also provide information on the taxonomic assignments
of specific T-RFs without the need for comprehensive
complementary clone libraries.
