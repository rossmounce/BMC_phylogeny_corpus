Abstract
Background: Aquaporins are a large family of transmembrane channel proteins that are present throughout all
domains of life and are implicated in human disorders. These channels, allow the passive but selective movement
of water and other small neutral solutes across cell membranes. Aquaporins have been classified into two subfamilies: i) strict aquaporins that only allow the passage of water and ii) the less selective aquaglyceroporins that
transport water and other neutral solutes, such as glycerol, CO2 or urea. Recently, the identification and
characterization of a number of archaeal and bacterial aquaporins suggested the existence of a third sub-family;
one that is neither a strict aquaporin nor an aquaglyceroporin. The function and phylogeny of this third family is
still a matter of debate.
Results: Twenty nanosecond molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of a fully hydrated tetramer of AqpM embedded
in a lipid bilayer permitted predictions to be made of key biophysical parameters including: single channel osmotic
permeability constant (pf), single channel diffusive permeability constant (pd), channel radius, potential water
occupancy of the channel and water orientation inside the pore. These properties were compared with those of
well characterized representatives of the two main aquaporin sub-families. Results show that changes in the amino
acid composition of the aromatic/arginine region affect the size and polarity of the selectivity filter (SF) and could
help explain the difference in water permeability between aquaporins. In addition, MD simulation results suggest
that AqpM combines characteristics of strict aquaporins, such as the narrow SF and channel radius, with those of
aquaglyceroporins, such as a more hydrophobic and less polar SF.
Conclusions: MD simulations of AqpM extend previous evidence that this archaeal aquaporin exhibits hybrid
features intermediate between the two known aquaporin sub-families, supporting the idea that it may constitute a
member of a novel class of aquaporins.

Background
Aquaporins are a large family of transmembrane channel proteins that are present throughout all domains of

human disorders [1]. Aquaporin channels allow the passive but selective movement of water and other small

neutral solutes such as glycerol, CO2, or urea across cell
membranes [1-4].
Structurally, Aquaporins present a homotetrameric
organization in which each monomer forms an individual functional pore. The canonical fold of the aquaporin monomer is characterized by a right-handed
helical bundle of six transmembrane a-helices (TM1 –
TM6) connected by 5 loop regions (loops A to E), in
which both amino and carboxyl termini face the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Loops B and E are
formed by a half-membrane spanning helical section
(HB and HE respectively) and a non-helical section that

contains the highly conserved Asn-Pro-Ala (NPA) motif,
considered a signature of this protein family [5-10].
The aquaporin channel posses two major constriction
zones, the NPA region, located at the centre of the pore
and the selectivity filter (SF) containing the aromatic/
arginine region, (ar/R), located ~8 Å above the NPA
region extending towards the extracellular side of the
channel. The ar/R region is formed by a residue from
helix TM2 (H2 position), a residue from helix TM5 (H5
position) and two residues from loop E (LE1, LE2 position respectively) [11,12]. This region plays a major role
in solute selectivity and permeability [13].
Different permeability to water and other solutes and
variations in the amino acid composition of the ar/R
region has led to the classification of aquaporins into
two main functional sub-families [14,15]. The first are
strict aquaporins, that only allow the passage of water
molecules, in which the ar/R region contains a Phe residue from TM2 (H2 position), a His residue from TM5
(H5), an Arg residue from the loop E (LE2) and a fourth
residue from loop E (LE1) that provides a backbone carbonyl oxygen, usually a Cys, Thr or Ala. In these aquaporins, the His and Arg residues of the SF are believed
to provide donor hydrogen bonds for water molecules
[14,15]. Examples of strict aquaporins are: AqpZ from
Escherichia coli [16,17], and the human Aqp0 [3], Aqp1
[7] and Aqp4[18]. The second are aquaglyceroporins,
less selective aquaporins that can transport water and
other solutes, such as glycerol, urea and other
uncharged small molecules [19,20]. In these aquaporins,
the Phe residue at position H2 is replaced by Trp residue, the His residue at position H5 is replaced by Gly
residue and the small residue at position LE1 is replaced
by a Phe, giving rise to a wider SF and a so called
“hydrophobic corner” formed by Trp (H2) and Phe
(LE1) residues [3,20-23]. Similar to strict aquaporins,
position LE2 is occupied by an Arg residue that is highly
conserved in both aquaporin sub-families. Examples of
aquaglyceroporins are: GlpF [19-21,23] from E. coli, and
human aquaporins Aqp7, Aqp3, Aqp9 and Aqp10 [3].
The recent identification of archaeal aquaporins that
exhibit a different amino acid composition of their SF,
and thus cannot be readily classified in either of the two
aforementioned aquaporin sub-families, has led to the
suggestion that a third functional sub-family of aquaporins may exist [24,25]. It has been suggested that this
family could contain special adaptations for the conduction of solutes specific for the life-style of the organisms
or, alternatively, that they could be a primitive non-specialized aquaporin, an ancestor of the more specialized
aquaporins [2,24,26]. The SF of these archaeal aquaporins exhibits the highly conserved Arg residue in position
LE2, the Phe residue at position H2, and a Ser residue
in position LE1 that provides its main chain carbonyl

oxygen. However a key difference in the composition of
the SF of these aquaporins lies in the presence of a
medium size hydrophobic residue such as Ile, Leu or
Val instead of the His residue highly conserved in strict
aquaporins or the Gly residue present in aquaglyceroporins in position H5 [24,25].
To date, the only representative of this type of aquaporins that has been experimentally studied is AqpM,
found in the archaeon Methanothermobacter marburgensis [24,25]. The osmotic water permeability constant,
Pf, obtained for AqpM, showed that its osmotic permeability was lower than the P f of the strict aquaporins
AqpZ from E.coli, and slightly higher than the Pf of the
aquaglyceroporin from E. coli GlpF [24,25]. (Pf (AqpM)
= 57 μms-1 [24]; Pf (AqpZ) = 330 μms-1 [27]; Pf (GlpF)
= 49 μms-1 [27]). Moreover, the transient glycerol permeability measured for AqpM resulted in values considerably lower than the glycerol permeability for GlpF
[24]. These previous results have led to the suggestion
that AqpM could be a water transporter and also with
the ability to transport other neutral solutes required by
the archaeon such as CO2, the only carbon source available in the natural environment of M. marburgensis, or
even H2S, the terminal electron acceptor in its energy
production pathway [24][25].
In this work we report the results of the first molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study performed on a
fully hydrated model of the AqpM tetramer embedded
in a lipid bilayer (as shown in Figure 1). Key biophysical
parameters were estimated from the MD simulation,
including: single channel osmotic permeability constant
(pf), single channel diffusive permeability constant (pd),
channel radius, potential water occupancy of the channel and water orientation inside the pore.
The results of this study extend the information
regarding the permeability and selectivity mechanisms
of AqpM and provide further insight into the water permeability of aquaporins in general and the particular differences between the sub-families of aquaporins and the
implications of these differences for their function.

Results and discussion
Single channel osmotic water permeability constant

The single-channel osmotic water permeability constant
( pf ) is a key parameter that allows the characterization
of the water transport mechanism of aquaporins [28,29].
An estimation of pf can be obtained from equilibrium
MD simulations and can provide information about the
water permeation mechanisms of aquaporins at the
atomic level [28,30]. Here, we report the calculation and
analysis of pf obtained from a 20 ns simulation of the
AqpM tetramer. The calculation of pf is based on the
collective diffusion model for water permeation through
microscopic channels developed by Zhu et al. [30].

six transmembrane (TM1-TM6) and two half-membrane (HB and HE) spanning helices are labeled. The red vdW spheres represent the oxygen
atoms of the single file of water molecules inside the AqpM monomer.

Initially, a trajectory for the collective coordinate n(t)
was derived (Eq. 5) and the corresponding mean square
displacements n 2(t) were calculated (Eq. 6). Figure
2a displays the trajectory of the collective coordinates n
(t) for each monomer of AqpM in the 20 ns simulation
and Figure 2b shows n 2(t) computed by averaging
200 100-ps time windows, each one considered as a
time origin (i.e n(t = t`) = 0). The length of the channel
is a necessary parameter for computing n(t) and was
defined as the average length of the constriction region
(CR) of the AqpM channel, L = L(t) t = 19.9¯ , considered as the average distance between the atoms G195
(N182/G198):O† and C79(G60/A65):O, over the 20 ns
simulation. The single-channel osmotic water

permeability constant pf was obtained from n 2(t) via
Dn (Eq. 6 and Eq. 7) and yields a value ranging between
5.6x10-14 cm3s-1 and 8.3x10-14 cm3s-1 among the four
monomers. Averaging over the four monomers, a value
of (6.4±1.4) x10-14 cm3s-1 is obtained. Additional details
are provided in Table 1.
Experimental measurements of the osmotic permeability of AqpM have been reported in terms of total membrane osmotic permeability constant (Pf ) obtained from
AqpM reconstituted into liposomes with values of 57
[24] and 60 μms -1 [26]. In order to compare these
values to the single-channel water osmotic permeability
(pf ) values obtained in this study, an estimation of pf
from P f was made using the method of Borgnia et al.

[16] to estimate the pf of AqpZ [24,26]. The estimation
consists in dividing P f by the number of channels per
unit area (channel density). According to this, an experimentally derived estimate of the pf of AqpM is ≈ 0.7x1014
cm3s-1. This suggests that the pf value obtained from
the AqpM MD simulation presented here ((6.4±1.4)
x10-14 cm3s-1) overestimates the osmotic permeability of
AqpM by a factor of ~ 9. Interestingly this overestimation of p f from MD simulations has already been
observed for AqpZ and other strict aquaporins and
most notoriously for GlpF [28,31]. In tables 2 and 3 we
present results for water permeability obtained for
AqpM, Aqp1, Aqp4 and GlpF from MD simulations studies and experiments, respectively. The results in these
tables show an apparent inverse relationship between
experimental and MD simulation derived results. GlpF
has been shown experimentally to be a slow water transporter. However in MD simulation studies it appears to
be a fast water transporter, with p f values equal or
greater than those obtained for prototypical and well
studied strict aquaporins like AqpZ, Aqp1 or Aqp4
[28,31,32]. The cause of this discrepancy has been discussed and is attributed mainly to assumptions related
to the forcefield and water model used for MD

simulations and on the difficulty to determine accurately
the number of active channels present when estimating
pf experimentally [28,31].
An examination of the published MD simulation
results obtained for representative aquaporins from both
sub-families, including AqpZ [28,31,32] and GlpF
[28,31-33] from E.coli, and mammalian Aqp1 [29,31,32]
and Aqp4 [31,34], revealed significant discrepancies on
the values obtained for the osmotic and diffusive water
permeability and the pf/pd ratio for the same aquaporin
between different studies (see Table 2). These discrepancies may arise from the use of different force-fields,
water models, simulation protocols, simulation times,
and insufficient sampling due to the limited time scale
of all-atom MD simulations [31]. This issue together
with the fact that only one representative from the
aquaglyceroporins sub-family, GlpF from E. coli, has
been subjected to MD-simulation studies, whereas four
representatives from the strict aquaporins have been
widely studied (Aqp0, Aqp1, Aqp4, AqpZ) exacerbates
the problem of aquaporin sub-family comparisons in
terms of water permeability and thus difficult the interpretation of the data obtained for newly described aquaporins such as AqpM in terms of water permeability. In
an attempt to overcome these difficulties and to establish a clear point of reference, the present study of
AqpM was performed using simulation protocols and
analyses methods similar to those previously used in the
study of AqpZ and GlpF [28,35], including: i) the use of
the same force-field (CHARMM22 for protein and
CHARMM27 for lipids), and water model (TIP3P), ii)
similar simulation protocol (NPT ensemble, Periodic
Boundary Condition, no constraints applied in the production run), iii) similar simulation time (20ns) and
temperature (310K) and iv) the same MD engine
(NAMD) (see methods). The comparison results in the

following trend: p f (AqpZ) <p f (AqpM) <p f (GlpF) (see
table 2) indicating that the single channel osmotic water
permeability of AqpM presents a value of pfthat is intermediate between those obtained for AqpZ and GlpF. As
a whole, this evidence suggests that AqpM exhibits
water osmotic permeability that is intermediate between
strict aquaporins and aquaglyceroporins and thus could
belong to a third sub-family of aquaporins.
Single-channel diffusive water permeability constant

The single channel diffusive water permeability constant
pd is another key feature that describes the water permeation mechanism of aquaporins, and is related to the
number of water molecules that traverse the channel
per unit time (i.e the number of permeation events)
[28,36]. In the 20 ns simulation reported here, a total of
69 permeation events were observed (N±), with N+ = 35
and N -= 34. The accumulated number of permeation
events grows linearly with time and the number of permeation events occurring in either direction is as
expected, since in an equilibrium MD simulation no net
water flow should be present (Fig. 3). Then the unidirectional rate constant (k0) was determined by using: k0=N
± /2nmt sim , where N ± is the number of accumulated
bidirectional permeation events, tsim is the simulation
time discarding the first ns (tsim = 20-1 = 19 ns) and
nm represents the number of monomers (nm=4). Using
k 0 (k 0 = 0.5ns -1 ) and Eq. 3, a value of p d = 1.4 x10 -14
cm3s-1 was obtained for the AqpM tetramer. Additional
details and pd estimates for each monomer are provided
in Table 1.

As noted for pf , different MD simulation studies of
the same aquaporin show significant discrepancies
between the values obtained for pd (see table 2). However, despite these discrepancies a trend is apparent, in
which GlpF appears with the highest p d values with
respect to all other aquaporins including AqpM. The
observation that the higher transport rate appears to be
in an opposite trend with respect to experimental results
can be explained by the wider pore of GlpF that could
allow more water-water interchanges and thus more
permeation events per unit time, increasing the value of
pd (see below). As mentioned above for pf, this fact can
be mainly attributed to the nature of MD simulations,
and specifically to the water model used, the van der
Waals parameters of the forcefield, and non-physical
breathing movements of the channel. Following the
argument used for the comparison of p f values, we
obtained for pd the same trend observed for pf(pd(AqpZ)
<pd(AqpM) <pd(GlpF). This result indicates that the single channel diffusive water permeability of AqpM presents values that are intermediate between those
obtained for AqpZ and GlpF, using equivalent simulation methods [28]. This observation, together with the
results observed for pf, provides the evidence to support
the notion that AqpM could be a representative of a
third aquaporin sub-family that exhibits properties that
are intermediate between those of strict aquaporins and
aquaglyceroporins.
pf / pd ratio

According to the continuous time random walk
(CTRW) model developed for single-file water transport
[37], the pf / pd ratio is related to the number of steps
that a water molecule must perform in order to traverse
the
channel
and
follows
the
relation:
p f / p d = N + 1 [37,38] were N is the average number
of water molecules inside the channel. Thus the pf /pd
ratio can be used as a measure of the “single-fileness” of

Araya-Secchi et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12(Suppl 4):S8
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/S4/S8

water movement inside the channel, and for a channel
in which the water molecules are perfectly aligned in
single file p f / p d < N [28,37,38]. Values of p f / p d < N
indicates that the single-fileness of the water molecules
inside the channel is interrupted by occasional waterwater interchanges that increase p d , i.e., more water
molecules traverse the channel per unit time [28,37,38].
Water-water interchanges do not affect pf because the
latter is related to the displacement of individual water
molecules inside the channel and is not influenced by
the occurrence of water-water interchanges. From the
20 ns simulation of the AqpM tetramer, we obtained 3.0
<pf / pd < 9.1 with an average value over the four monomers of pf / pd ≈ 6.1 and an average channel occupancy
equal to N ≈ 7.5 (see below). These results suggest that
water molecules move in single file in the AqpM channel with occasional water-water interchange events.
For AqpZ , Aqp1 and Aqp4, values of p f / p d ≥ N
have been reported, whereas for the aquaglyceroporin
GlpF p f / p d < N [28,31]. This indicates that strict-aquaporins, with their narrower pore posses a more idealized
single-file water transport mechanism. Interestingly, this
relation holds despite the aforementioned discrepancies
between the values for pd and pf observed between different MD-simulation studies. Our results shows that, in
terms of the pf / pd ratio, AqpM presents a similar level
of single-fileness with respect to strict aquaporins (see
table 2) but with an average value of p f / p d < N suggesting that AqpM allows more water-water interchanges
than strict aquaporins. This could be explained by the
slightly wider ar/R region of AqpM due to the replacement of the His residue in position H5 conserved in strict
aquaporins by the smaller and apolar Ile residue.

Channel occupancy

Water occupancy histograms from the 20 ns simulation
of the AqpM tetramer are shown for each monomer in
Figure 4, and the averages are listed in Table.1. Histograms were generated by counting the number of water
molecules inside the constriction region (CR) of each
AqpM monomer for 10000 snapshots separated by 2 ps
taken from the 20 ns MD simulation. The four monomers show a similar behaviour with their occupancy
fluctuating closely around the tetramer average water
occupancy n ≈ N ≈ 7.5 (Fig.4). The value of water
occupancy reported here for AqpM is in agreement with
results obtained from similar MD simulations of other
aquaporins (see Table 2) [28,31,35] and for water transport in carbon nanotubes of similar length [37,38] in
which a value of N ≈ 7 – 1 was found.
Channel radius

The channel radius of AqpM was computed using the
HOLE program [39]. A total of 10000 configurations
separated by 2 ps of each AqpM monomer taken from

Figure 5 The constriction region of the simulated AqpM channel. (a) Channel radius calculated with HOLE [39]. The continuous black line
represents the radius average over 10000 snapshots of each monomer (40000 snapshots) separated by 2 ps taken from the 20 ns simulation.
The red dashed lines represent the channel fluctuations (standard deviation). The horizontal black dashed lines represent the boundaries of the
constriction region (-9 Å < z < 11 Å) (zone surrounded by a dashed circle in b). The horizontal blue line indicates the selectivity filter (SF) located
in the extra-cellular side (-6 Å < z < -2 Å) that comprises the narrowest part of the channel. The green vertical line indicates the position of the
NPA region (2 Å < z < 4 Å) where a minor narrowing of the channel occurs. (b) Snapshot of the AqpM constriction region. The half-helices of
the re-entrant loops HE and HB are shown as purple ribbons. The non-helical parts of the loops are shown as white ribbons and the main-chain
carbonyl groups that form the hydrogen-bond ladder of the AqpM channel are colored by element (cyan = carbon, red = oxygen, blue =
nitrogen). Potential hydrogen bonds between carbonyl groups and water molecules and between the water molecules are shown as black
dashed lines. Numbers below the lines represent the average distance between the atoms involved in the hydrogen bond (in Å). The residues
comprising the selectivity filter (Phe 62, Ile 187, Arg 202) are colored by element (cyan = carbon, red = oxygen, blue = nitrogen) and non-polar
hydrogen atoms were removed for clarity. The two NPA motifs are shown as green ribbons and the sidechains of Asn 82, and Asn 199 are
colored by element as described above and non-polar hydrogen atoms were removed for clarity. The region surrounded by a black dashed
circle corresponds to the constriction region of the AqpM channel.

other MD-simulated aquaporins, shows that the AqpM
channel exhibits an average radius similar to AqpZ ≈
1.9 Ǻ but is narrower than the average channel radius
(≈ 2.5 Ǻ) of GlpF [28,31,32]. As reported for other
aquaporins [28,32,35], the minimum radius of the
AqpM channel is found at the extracellular side in the
selectivity filter (SF) or ar/R region composed of residues R202(R189/R206) † , F62(F43/W48) and I187
(H174/G191) with an average value of 1.4 Å, close to
the radius of a single water molecule. This narrowing
of the pore at the SF, together with the small fluctuations (RMS) during the MD simulation found on this
region (Fig. 5a), suggest that only water and small neutral solutes with similar radius such as CO 2 or H 2 S
could potentially pass through the selectivity filter of
AqpM [26]. However, it has been shown recently that
AqpM is not an H 2 S transporter [25], thus more
experimental and theoretical studies of AqpM are
required to determine whether this aquaporin can
transport other solutes through its channel.

Water orientation

To measure the degree of ordering and orientation of
water molecules inside the constriction region of AqpM,
two order parameters
and
P1(z) = cos(q )z
P2(z) = 0.5 3cos 2(q )z − 1 , were measured. In both
parameters θ is the angle between the unit vector
approximately aligned along the channel axis/membrane
ˆ
normal, n z , and the water dipole vector. Both parameters P1(z) and P2(z) serve as indications of the average alignment and orientation of the water dipole
relative to the channel axis and thus permit the prediction of the water orientation inside aquaporin channels
[31-35]. The order parameter P1(z) ranges from -1 to 1,
and shows the average orientation of the water dipoles
with respect to the channel axis (n z ) . Negative values
indicate that the water dipoles are aligned parallel to the
channel axis and pointing towards the intracellular side
of the channel. Positive values indicate that the water
dipoles are aligned parallel to the channel axis and
pointing towards the extracellular side of the channel.

Araya-Secchi et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12(Suppl 4):S8
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/S4/S8

Values of P1(z) near or equal to 0 indicate a perpendicular orientation of the water dipoles with respect to the
channel axis. On the other hand P2(z), ranges from -0.5
to 1 and positive values indicates an average preferential
alignment of the water dipoles parallel to the channel
axis (n z ) , and negative values are an indication of preferential alignment of the water dipole perpendicular to
ˆ
n z . As can be inferred from an inspection of Figure 6,
water molecules appear to be highly ordered within the
constriction region (CR) of the AqpM pore and a bipolar orientation of the water dipoles with a dipole
inversion at the NPA region can be observed, where
both a minimum of P2(z) (Fig. 6b) and values near 0 for
P1(z) (Fig. 6a) are found, indicating that water dipoles
are oriented perpendicularly to the channel axis in this
region. Water molecules are aligned parallel to the
channel axis on both sides of the NPA motifs with their
dipoles pointing towards the NPA region. It has been
suggested that the bi-polar orientation of water inside
the pore of aquaporins is related to the blocking of proton passage through the channel and that could involve
a hydrogen donor/hydrogen acceptor pattern that probably induce the dipole inversion around the NPA motifs
[40]. The nature of this bi-polar water orientation has
been a matter of debate [41-44] and the current hypothesis is that the bi-polar water orientation itself is not
part of the proton blocking mechanism but rather is a
signature, an indirect effect of the electrostatic field generated by the two macro-dipoles of the helical part of
the re-entrant loops B and E. These macro-dipoles produce a concentration of positive charge in the NPA
region of the channel that generates an energetic barrier

Page 8 of 13

for protons blocking their passage through the pore
[44].
A bi-polar water orientation is clearly observed inside
the AqpM constriction region in the course of our MD
simulation (Fig.5b and Fig.6) and the hydrogen donor/
hydrogen acceptor pattern appears to be formed by: i)
the main chain carbonyl groups exposed to the channel
lumen at both sides of the NPA region provided by residues G195(N182/G199), S196(T183/F200), S197(S184/
A201) on the extra-cellular side, and residues H80(H61/
H66), C79(G60/A65) on the intra-cellular side, that
could act as hydrogen bond acceptors forming an
hydrogen-bond ladder within the pore and ii) the Asn
residues at the NPA region N199(N186/N203) and N82
(N63/N68) that act as hydrogen bond donors. An
increase in the values of P1(z) and negative values of P2
(z) are observed in the SF of AqpM, indicating that
water molecules in this region orient their dipoles perpendicular to the channel axis. This could reflect the
interaction of water molecules with the polar hydrogen
atoms Arg202(R189/R206):Hh and Arg202(R189/R206):
H ε that causes a change in the dipole orientation of
water molecules in this region. This interaction appears
to be enhanced due to the narrowing of the channel in
the SF of AqpM. Thus the unique amino acid composition of the SF of AqpM appears to influence the water
orientation in this zone of the channel. Calculation of
the same order parameters for other MD-simulated
aquaporins indicate that, in the case of strict aquaporins
like AqpZ and Aqp1, water molecules assume a more
perpendicular orientation of their dipoles with respect
to the channel axis around the SF due to the narrowing

Figure 6 Water orientation inside the constriction region of the AqpM channel. (a) Order parameter P1(z) = cos(q )z . (b) Order
parameter P2(z) = 0.5 3cos 2(q )z − 1 . θ is the angle between the unit vector, approximately aligned along the channel axis/
membrane normal, nz, and the water dipole vector. Both parameters were measured for each AqpM monomer from 10000 snapshots separated
by 2 ps taken from the 20 ns simulation. The black continuous line in each panel represents the average over the 10,000 snapshots and over the
four monomers. The error bars represent the standard deviation from the average.

of the pore and the strong interaction between water
molecules and the Arg (LE2 position) and His (H5 position) residues that comprise the SF of strict aquaporins
[28,31,32]. On the other hand, the wider and hydrophobic SF of the aquaglyceroporin GlpF allows more waterwater interactions and thus favours a water dipole orientation parallel to the channel axis [31,32,35].
Structure / sequence comparisons

The average structure of AqpM was compared with the
crystal structures of AqpZ [PDB:1RC2 (A chain)] [17],
b-Aqp1 [PDB:1J4N][45] , h-Aqp4 [PDB:3GD8][46] and
GlpF [PDB:1LDI] [40] using STAMP [47,48]. Fig.7a-c
compares the view from the extracellular side of AqpM
(Fig.7a) with that of AqpZ (Fig.7b) and GlpF (Fig.7C);
the latter were selected as prototypical representatives of
the strict aquaporin and aquaglyceroporin sub-families
respectively.
As can be observed in Figure 7(a-d), there are significant differences between the compared aquaporins,
regarding the residues that comprise their respective SFs
and their spatial arrangement (residues highlighted in
blue in Fig. 7d). Of particular interest, is the residue

Page 9 of 13

that occupies position H5 (TM5). In AqpZ, b-Aqp1 and
h-Aqp4 this position is occupied by a His residue conserved among strict aquaporins [8](Fig.7d). In GlpF and
other aquaglyceroporins position H5 is occupied by a
Gly, a feature that allows the formation of the so-called
“hydrophobic corner” by Trp48 (replaced by a Phe residue in AqpM and in strict aquaporins) in position H2
and Phe200 (a Ser residue in AqpM, a Tyr residue in
AqpZ, a Cys residue in b-Aqp1 and an ala residue in hAqp4) in position LE1 that allows the accommodation
of a glycerol molecule [19,20,49]. In AqpM, position H5
is occupied by Ile (I187), whereas in the other archaeal
aquaporins it is occupied either by Ile, Val or Leu
[24,26] generating an SF that is narrower than the SF of
aquaglyceroporins but wider and less polar than the SF
of strict aquaporins. Thus, the SF of AqpM can be
viewed as a slightly wider and more-hydrophobic version of the SF from strict aquaporins. Regarding the
hydrophobic residues that line the pore below the SF
(residues highlighted in red in red), it is interesting to
note that among the compared aquaporins these residues correspond to Val, Ile or Leu, except for AqpZ
that has two aromatic residues instead in two of these

nine positions. These considerations underscore the
notion that differences in water permeability between
aquaporins are most likely related to the size and polarity of the SF resulting from differences in critically
located amino acids. AqpM, with its unique SF, clearly
differs from the two other sub-families, exhibiting characteristics that are hybrid between an aquaglyceroporin
such as GlpF and a strict aquaporins like AqpZ.
Whether this differences permits AqpM to carry out different functions or whether it is just a “molecular fossil”
representing an early stage in the evolution of the other
aquaporins, as previously suggested [24,26,50], is an
issue that remains to be determined. However, the
apparent absence of aquaporin genes in a large number
of microbial genomes [49], together with the assertion
that given the small size and resultant large surface-tovolume ratio of individual microbial cells, lipid membranes are sufficiently permeable to support growth
without water channels that enhance water permeability
[51,52], have opened the debate about possible alternative roles for microbial aquaporins other than simple
water transport. These potential roles include osmotic
and turgor sensors [50], involvement in freeze tolerance
mechanisms [51] and transport of other neutral solutes
such as CO2, H2S, NH3 [51].

Conclusions
We have performed the first molecular dynamics simulation of the archaeal aquaporin AqpM, the most studied representative of a new group of aquaporins that
are not easily classifiable within the current functional
sub-families of aquaporins. From our MD simulation we
have provided estimations for key biophysical parameters of AqpM including: single channel osmotic permeability constant (p f ), single channel diffusive
permeability constant (p d ), channel radius, potential
water occupancy of the channel and water orientation
inside the pore. The results obtained from the MD
simulations of AqpM were compared with those
obtained by similar simulation methods for the well
characterized microbial representatives of the two main
aquaporin sub-families, AqpZ and GlpF, a strict aquaporin and an aquaglyceroporin respectively. Our results
extend the evidence that the size and polarity of the
residues that comprise the SF of aquaporins control
much of the selectivity and water permeability of aquaporins and supports the notion that AqpM belongs to a
third class of aquaporins that exhibits properties that
are intermediate between those of the other two classes.
However, it is clear that more experimental and theoretical evidence is needed to assess whether this third
class of aquaporins differs from the other sub-families in
other functional aspect besides water permeability rates

Page 10 of 13

i.e., if it exhibits permeability to other uncharged
solutes, related to the specific life style of the organisms
in which they are found or whether it could represent
an earlier evolutionary form, a molecular fossil, which
existed before the divergence of the other two subfamilies.

Methods
Modelling and simulation

The crystal structure of the AqpM monomer was
obtained from the Protein Data Bank [PDB :2F2B] [26].
Hydrogen atoms were added using the psfgen plug-in
from VMD v1.86 [53] (considering pH = 7.5 for protonation states). The tetrameric structure of AqpM was
generated with VMD v1.86 [53] using the coordinate
transformation matrices provided in the PDB file. The
simulated periodic cell was constructed using VMD
v1.88 [53] and comprised the AqpM tetramer embedded
in a pre-equilibrated 1,2-dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine
(DPPC) membrane patch of dimensions 100x100x58 Å.
The energy of the crystallographic waters of the monomer was evaluated with the program DOWSER [54],
keeping the waters that were located inside the pore.
The system was solvated with a water layer of 20Å
above and below the membrane. Ions (Na+, Cl-) were
randomly placed to neutralize the system, reaching a
final concentration of 50mM. The final dimensions of
the periodic cell were 100x100x96Å comprising a total
of 85,019 atoms. The full system and the structural features of AqpM can be seen in Figure 1.
The system was minimized and subjected to MD for
0.5 ns with fixed protein. The protein was released keeping Ca atoms constrained with a force constant of 5
kcal/mol/Å2. The full system was minimized and a slow
relaxation procedure was performed in which the constraint applied to Ca atoms of the protein was decreased
at a rate of 0.5 kcal/mol/ps until no constraint was
applied. Then 21 ns of NPT-MD simulations were performed with the first nanosecond considered equilibration and the last 20 ns used for analysis. The time
evolution of Ca - RMSD with respect to the final conformation of the minimization/relaxation procedure is
shown for each AqpM monomer in Figure S1(a) of Additional file 1. The fluctuations of Ca atoms during the
production run are presented a Ca – RMSF plot for each
AqpM monomer in Figure S1(b) of Additional file 1.
The program NAMD [55] with CHARMM27 parameter set [56-58] was used for the simulation. Periodic
boundary conditions were imposed and the particle
mesh Ewald method [59,60] was used for electrostatic
forces calculation. Constant temperature (310K) and
pressure (1 atm) were maintained by using Langevin
dynamics [61].

Analysis methods
Single channel water permeability constants

p f = v wDn

The key quantities that characterize transport properties
of a water channel are the single-channel permeability
constants: the osmotic permeability constant pf and the
diffusive permeability constant pd (measured in cm3 s-1)
[28-30,37]. In dilute solutions these constants are related
to the fluxes js and jtr due to solute (s) and tracer (tr)
concentration differences (ΔC) respectively.
j s = p f ΔC s

Water orientation

To characterize the equilibrium water orientation inside
the AqpM channel two order parameters based on
Legendre Polynomials where used:
P1(z) = cos(q )z

(1)

j tr = p d ΔC tr

(2)

Using equilibrium MD simulations both pf and pd can
be calculated. From the total number of complete permeation events (i.e the number of water molecules that
traverse the channel lumen per unit time) k0[28,29]pd
can be computed using:
pd = v wko

(3)

Where v w =V w /N A is the average volume of a water
molecule (2.99x10-23 cm3).
For the estimation of pf from equilibrium MD simulations the collective diffusion model for water permeation
through microscopic channels proposed by Zhu et al
[30] was used. In this model, a collective coordinate can
be defined by accumulating at time t the individual displacement along the channel axis (dzi) of all water molecules inside the constriction region (CR) of the channel
of average length L(t) t relative to t-δt. Thus:
dn(t) = 1 / L(t)

∑ dz (t)

By setting n=0 at t=0, n(t) can be determined by the
integration of dn:
n(t) =

∫ dt / L(t) ∑ [ zi(t) − zi(t − d t) ], d t = 2 ps,
i∈CR(t)

(5)

At equilibrium n(t) can be described as a one-dimensional unbiased random walk. By computing the mean
square displacement (MSD) of n, n 2(t) , the collective
diffusion constant can be obtained [30]:
D n = n 2(t) / 2t ,

Average structure of AqpM

The average structure considered for the structural
alignment presented in section Structure / Sequence
Comparisons (Results and discussion) and in Figure 7
was obtained by averaging the Cartesian coordinates of
all the atoms of one monomer of AqpM from the last
nanosecond of the simulation at a 2ps resolution (500
frames).
