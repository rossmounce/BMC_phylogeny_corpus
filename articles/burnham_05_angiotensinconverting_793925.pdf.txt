Abstract
Background: Members of the M2 family of peptidases, related to mammalian angiotensin
converting enzyme (ACE), play important roles in regulating a number of physiological processes.
As more invertebrate genomes are sequenced, there is increasing evidence of a variety of M2
peptidase genes, even within a single species. The function of these ACE-like proteins is largely
unknown. Sequencing of the A. gambiae genome has revealed a number of ACE-like genes but
probable errors in the Ensembl annotation have left the number of ACE-like genes, and their
structure, unclear.
Results: TBLASTN and sequence analysis of cDNAs revealed that the A. gambiae genome contains
nine genes (AnoACE genes) which code for proteins with similarity to mammalian ACE. Eight of
these genes code for putative single domain enzymes similar to other insect ACEs described so far.
AnoACE9, however, has several features in common with mammalian somatic ACE such as a two
domain structure and a hydrophobic C terminus. Four of the AnoACE genes (2, 3, 7 and 9) were
shown to be expressed at a variety of developmental stages. Expression of AnoACE3, AnoACE7 and
AnoACE9 is induced by a blood meal, with AnoACE7 showing the largest (approximately 10-fold)
induction.
Conclusion: Genes coding for two-domain ACEs have arisen several times during the course of
evolution suggesting a common selective advantage to having an ACE with two active-sites in
tandem in a single protein. AnoACE7 belongs to a sub-group of insect ACEs which are likely to be
membrane-bound and which have an unusual, conserved gene structure.

Background
In mammals, angiotensin-converting enzyme (EC
3.4.15.1, ACE, peptidyl-dipeptidase A), an important
member of the M2 peptidase family, is found on the surface of endothelial cells and is best known for its role in

the biosynthesis of angiotensin II, as well as the degradation of circulating bradykinin and the haemoregulatory
peptide, N-acetyl SDKP [1-3]. Mammalian ACE exists as
two isoforms, a somatic form (sACE, 150–180 kDa) and a
smaller protein (germinal ACE, 90–110 kDa) found

exclusively in adult testes. The ACE gene comprises
twenty-six exons and two promoters, and has clearly
arisen by gene duplication [4]. The somatic promoter
drives expression of the larger protein (exons 1–12 and
exons 14–26), which consists of two very similar domains
connected in tandem by a short inter-domain peptide.
Each domain possesses a functional peptidase active site
and they are commonly called the N- and C-domains after
their relative position to the amino and carboxy termini.
The bulk of the protein including the amino terminus is
extracellular and is linked by a hydrophobic transmembrane sequence to a short intracellular peptide. The biological rationale for two catalytic units linked in tandem is
not known, although there is experimental evidence to
suggest that co-operativity exists between the two halves
of the protein [5-7].
In developing spermatids, an alternative intragenic promoter utilises exons 13–26 and generates a single domain
ACE (gACE) which is largely identical to the C-terminal
domain of somatic ACE [4,8]. Male mice lacking gACE are
infertile as a result of sperm that are defective in migration
in the oviduct and in binding to the zona pellucida [9].
Insect ACE has broad substrate specificity and its presence
in the haemolymph of insects raises the possibility that,
like mammalian sACE, it is required for extracellular
metabolism of peptide hormones [10,11]. Drosophila melanogaster has six ACE-like genes (Ance, Acer, Ance-2, Ance3, Ance-4 and Ance-5), all coding for single domain proteins. The ANCE protein has been relatively well characterised and has been shown to have several biochemical
similarities to the mammalian enzyme. Its activity is
developmentally regulated, with highest levels during
metamorphosis [12,13]. ANCE is also expressed in spermatocytes and appears to have an important role in spermiogenesis [14]. Of the other Drosophila ACEs, only the
Acer gene product has been studied biochemically and it

is likely that ANCE-2, ANCE-3, ANCE-4 and ANCE-5 do
not function as peptidases since they lack one or more of
the residues that are essential for peptidase activity [15].
ACER, like ANCE and human ACE, is a peptidyl dipeptidase, but is generally less efficient than ANCE at cleaving
dipeptides from many oligopeptide substrates [16]. Acer is
expressed in the embryonic heart [17] and in both the
male and female gonads and brain of adult flies (A.
Carhan, R. E. Isaac and A. D. Shirras, unpublished results)
where it is assumed to have a role in the metabolism of, as
yet unidentified, biologically active peptides involved in
neuroendocrine signalling and reproduction.
ACE activity has been found in the gonads and accessory
glands of several insect species in addition to D. melanogaster, suggesting a conserved role for this enzyme in
insect reproduction [10,11]. Recently, we have provided
evidence for a role for ACE in reproduction in the mosquito, A. stephensi. ACE activity in the adult female mosquito increases by 260% following a blood meal [10,18]
and it has been proposed that the induced ACE has a role
in regulating peptide signalling in response to a blood
meal. We have shown that feeding two different ACE
inhibitors to male A. stephensi in their glucose diet,
resulted in approx. 80% reduction in the number of eggs
laid [10]. In addition, ACE inhibitors introduced in the
blood meal, resulted in a dose-dependent effect on broodsize, but had no effect on oocyte development, nor the
rate of digestion of the blood. The only observable difference between inhibitor-fed and control insects was that
the inhibitor-fed females could not lay eggs, even 8 days
after the blood meal, suggesting that the blood-induced
ACE is involved in the control of egg-laying [19].
To understand the mechanism of ACE induction in
blood-fed mosquitoes and the role of the enzyme in mosquito reproductive physiology, we have characterised the
ACE gene family in Anopheles gambiae, a mosquito respon-

*alternative transcripts with different 5' exons
† 3' exons of AnoACE7, 69 kb downstream of the rest of the gene

sible for the transmission of the human malaria parasite
and whose genome has recently been sequenced [20]. The
partially annotated A gambiae genome [21] reveals
between eight and twelve potential ACE-like genes. We
now report the correct number of A. gambiae ACE
(AnoACE) genes, confirm their corresponding protein
sequences and establish their expression patterns during
development and in response to a blood meal. We show
that several of the AnoACEs are similar to other insect
ACEs, but that AnoACE9 is a novel two-domain ACE
whose structure resembles that of human somatic ACE.

Results
ACE-like genes in the A. gambiae genome
The Ensembl annotation of the A. gambiae genome (version 34.2 g) [21] suggests that there are eight genes encoding proteins belonging to the M2 (ACE) family of
peptidases. BLAST searching of the genome and an examination of the predicted genes, however, shows that not all
ACE-like proteins have been predicted, while several of
those that have been identified have missing exons, or are
hybrids, composed of exons from more than one ACE-like
gene. These problems are particularly acute for a cluster of
ACE-like sequences at 35C on chromosome 3R (Fig. 1). In
order to confirm the number and organisation of ACE-like
genes in the A. gambiae genome a combination of
TBLASTN analysis [21], using Drosophila melanogaster ACE
proteins as query sequences, and cDNA sequence analysis
was carried out. Results are summarised in Tables 2 and 3

and may be viewed as a custom track in Ensembl Mosquito [37].
TBLASTN analysis revealed 11 possible ACE-like coding
sequences. Six of these sequences are arranged in a tightly
linked tandem cluster at 35C (Figs. 1 &2). These were
numbered (from 5' to 3') AnoACE 2,3,4,5,6 and 7. Several
EST clones exist for AnoACE2 and AnoACE3, allowing the
exons of these genes, and their coding regions to be unambiguously assigned. AnoACE3 has two alternative transcripts which differ in their first exon. No cDNA clones are
available for AnoACEs 4, 5 and 6. The exons of these genes
were identified by BLAST similarity and the SNAP exon
predictions of Ensembl [21]. The nucleotide sequences of
AnoACEs 5 and 6 are 97% identical, including the introns,
which raised the possibility that these two genes are the
result of a sequence assembly error caused by nucleotide
polymorphisms in the PEST strain. This high level of identity is only observed within the putative transcribed
region, however. The upstream flanking sequence of
AnoACE6 shares only around 75% identity with the
AnoACE5 upstream DNA and there is no significant similarity between the downstream flanking sequences of the
two genes. An assembly error can therefore be ruled out.
The AnoACE7 gene has an unusual organisation; there are
eight upstream exons situated at the 3' end of the 35C
cluster which encode the bulk of the protein and there are
two exons encoding the C terminus of the protein 69 kb

sequence and which had a putative signal peptide. This
was assumed to correspond to the N terminus of the
AnoACE7 precursor.
The AnoACE9 gene contains two ACE-like coding regions.
The sequence of cDNA 19600449703686 (MRA-468-36)
spans both coding regions (Ensembl annotation), indicating that this is a single gene coding for a double-domain
protein, rather than two separate genes (Fig. 3).
AnoACE proteins
Protein sequences were predicted from cDNAs for
AnoACEs 2, 3, 7 and 9. AnoACEs 1, 4, 5, 6 and 8 were predicted from genomic sequence and alignment with Drosophila ACE proteins. Predicted properties of the proteins
are summarised in Table 4. Signal peptides were identified

for all proteins except AnoACEs 1 and 8. All of the AnoACE
genes, except for AnoACE9, code for single domain proteins similar to those previously found in insects.
AnoACE9 is a putative double domain enzyme, similar to
mammalian somatic ACE. Two of the AnoAces (7 and 9)
have hydrophobic C termini which might serve as membrane anchors or be lost as a result of post-translational
modification with a GPI anchor [22,23]. AnoACE7 has an
extended N terminus, compared to the other proteins. All
proteins have a full complement of required active site
amino acids in the HExxH...EAV/I/L motif (Fig. 4). Predicted protein sequences are available as additional data

AnoACEs 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 cluster with Drosophila ANCE
and ACER, and ACE-like proteins from Apis mellifera, Haematobia irritans, Lutzomyia longipalpis and Bombyx mori.
These proteins are all single domain proteins which lack a
hydrophobic C terminus. A second cluster of insect proteins contains AnoACEs 7 and 8, the two remaining Apis
ACEs and Drosophila ANCE-3. AnoACE7 is a one-to-one
orthologue of ANCE-3 and of Apis 3929. AnoACE8 is a

one-to-one orthologue of Apis 10228. There appears to be
no Drosophila orthologue of AnoACE8. The similarity of
the AnoACE7 group extends to the genomic organisation
of the genes. In each case the bulk of the protein is
encoded by a set of upstream exons and these are separated from the downstream exons, encoding the C terminus of the protein by a large intron. In the case of
Anopheles the intron is 69 kb in length, in Drosophila 35 kb
and in Apis 21 kb. The proteins in this group are characterised by an extended N terminus, rich in proline and
charged amino acids. AnoACE7 and Drosophila ANCE-3
have a hydrophobic C terminus but this is absent from the
predicted Apis protein. GPI anchor prediction software
[23] predicts no GPI anchor for AnoACE7 whereas Drosophila ANCE-3 has a strong GPI anchor prediction.
AnoACEs 1 and 9 are placed in a cluster with a diverse

Evolutionary relationships of invertebrate and chordate ACE-like proteins. Core sequences (corresponding to
amino acids161 to 569 of the AnoACE2 pre-protein) of each protein were aligned and a neighbour-joining tree calculated using
CLUSTALX [36]. TreeView was used to produce a radial tree. Sequences used were AnoACEs (Ag)1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9
(N and C domains); D. melanogaster ANCE, ACER, ANCE-2, -3, -4 and -5; B. mori ACE (accession no. BAA97657); H. irritans

ANCEs-2, -4 and -5, the C. elegans ACE-like protein ACN1 and vertebrate ACE2. The latter protein, while having
sequence similarity to ACEs, has a different enzymatic
activity and acts as a carboxypeptidase rather than a
dipeptidase. Several members of this group (Drosophila
ANCEs-2, -4 and -5, ACN-1) lack one or more essential
active site amino acids and are therefore unlikely to be
active peptidases. AnoACE9 has several structural similarities with chordate ACEs. It has two active site domains
and a hydrophobic C terminus with a strong GPI anchor
prediction (Fig. 6). The N and C domains of this protein
are more similar to each other than to other ACEs, unlike
the vertebrate N and C domains which cluster together.
Expression of AnoACE genes
Primers for all AnoACE genes were validated by PCR
amplification of genomic DNA or cDNA. Each primer pair
produced a product of the expected size (Fig. 7).

For semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis RNA was extracted
and cDNA produced from different developmental stages
of mosquitoes, namely, eggs, larvae, pupae, adult males,
glucose-fed females and blood-fed females. Figure 7
shows that AnoACEs 2, 3, 7 and 9 are expressed at all
developmental stages tested, whereas no PCR product was
observed for AnoACEs 1, 4, 5, 6 and 8. The authenticity of
the products from AnoACE2, 3, 7 and 9 was confirmed by
cloning into the pGEM T-Easy® vector and sequencing.
Gene expression for all the AnoACE genes was analysed in
glucose and blood-fed females using quantitative realtime RT-PCR. Other than AnoACEs 2,3,7 and 9, expression
levels were as for no template controls. Transcription of
AnoACE3, AnoACE7 and AnoACE9 was shown to be upregulated 48 hours following a blood meal (Fig. 8). The
increase in transcription was consistent for three separate
cohorts of female mosquitoes.

Discussion

Figure
RT-PCR7analysis of AnoACE gene expression
RT-PCR analysis of AnoACE gene expression. RNA was
extracted from glucose fed adult females, blood fed adult
females, eggs, larvae, pupae and adult males. Control templates for amplification were genomic DNA except for
AnoACE2 primers when the template was DNA from cDNA
clone 19600449622752 (MRA-467-39). Amplification products were observed for AnoACEs 2, 3, 7 and 9 only.

Our analysis of the A. gambiae genome has revealed nine
ACE-like genes. This is the largest number of ACE genes
for any species with a complete genome sequence. Drosophila melanogaster has six ACE-like genes [15], but only
two of these (Ance and Acer) are known to code for active
peptidase proteins. As well as having the ACE-like genes
found in D. melanogaster, D. pseudoobscura has an additional Ance-like gene which is likely to code for an active
peptidase, since all the amino acids that are necessary for
catalysis and coordination with the active site zinc are
conserved (A.D. Shirras, unpublished work). Apis mellifera
has three ACE-like genes, each with a full complement of
the critical active site amino acids [24]. At present we have
evidence that at least four AnoACE genes (2, 3, 7 and 9) are
expressed, but have no evidence for expression of
AnoACEs 1, 4, 5, 6 and 8. All of the AnoACE genes, how-

ever, have complete open reading frames and the corresponding proteins have a full complement of essential
active site amino acids, so we cannot rule out the expression of the other genes at low levels, in a small number of
cells or at stages that we have not examined.
Some of the AnoACE genes have clearly arisen by recent
gene duplications. The cluster at 35C contains five genes
that are closely related in sequence. Two of these
(AnoACE5 and AnoACE6) are almost identical. Similar
clusters of other duplicated genes exist within the A. gambiae genome; for example there is a cluster of M14 carboxypeptidase genes at 29D which contains adjacent genes
with greater than 90% identity. In both these clusters the
high levels of identity are restricted to the transcribed
regions with flanking DNA showing lower levels of similarity. This suggests that selective pressures are maintaining the nucleotide sequences of these genes and that they
are expressed at some stage.
Comparison of ACE protein sequences (Fig. 5) suggests
that there are three functional groupings in insects. The
first contains Drosophila ANCE, AnoACEs 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6
and several other insect ACEs. These are single domain,
secreted enzymes. This class of ACE proteins is similar to
the chordate N and C domains, both in terms of sequence
and enzyme activity. The second group includes
AnoACE7, Drosophila ANCE-3 and Apis 3929. These proteins are single domain, but have extended N termini. The
Drosophila and mosquito proteins have a hydrophobic C
terminus suggesting that they may be membrane-tethered. The active sites of these three proteins are characterised by an alanine in place of glycine at position 4 of the

The third group of insect ACEs, containing AnoACE1 and
Drosophila ANCE-2, -4 and -5, is highly divergent. These
appear to be secreted proteins and, whereas AnoACE1
may be enzymically active, the Drosophila examples lack
essential active site amino acids. C. elegans ACN-1 and vertebrate ACE2 proteins form highly diverged members of
this family. This result is to be expected as they have distinctive and highly evolved roles in these animals [25,11].
AnoACE9 is highly unusual. Phylogenetic analyses using
several different tree construction methods (NeighbourJoining, Maximum Parsimony, Minimum Evolution,
Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean)
do not place it convincingly in any of the insect groups
described above. In terms of overall structure it is more
similar to mammalian somatic ACE than to any invertebrate ACE described so far (Fig. 6). It has two active site
domains and has a hydrophobic C terminus. This similarity with vertebrate ACEs is, as far as we know, unique
amongst non-chordate invertebrates. It is likely that
AnoACE9 is membrane bound, either by virtue of its
hydrophobic C-terminus or via a potential GPI anchor. In
mammals, membrane sACE can be released from the
plasma membrane by unidentified metalloproteases,
known as secretases or sheddases, that cleave the Arg-Ser
bond in the Ala-Arg-Ser-Glu motif of the juxtamembrane
stalk [26,27]. Interestingly, a similar peptide sequence
(Leu-Arg-Ser-Asp) is found in the same position in the
proposed juxtamembrane stalk of AnoACE9 (Fig. 6),
which might serve as a cleavage site for a mosquito ACE
secretase.
In mammals, the two active sites of sACE are involved in
the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II and the
hydrolysis of bradykinin, but only the N-domain is
involved in N-acetyl SDKP metabolism [2]. Thus, duplication appears to have provided an opportunity for the Ndomain to acquire distinctive substrate specificity. However, this does not explain why mammalian sACE is a single protein with two catalytic domains joined by a peptide
linker, rather than single genes encoding single domain
proteins as occurs in D. melanogaster. Our phylogenetic
analysis indicates that the gene duplication event leading
to the two-domain vertebrate somatic ACE, occurred
around 450 million years ago, before the divergence of
amphibians and fishes, and that two other very similar
events occurred independently to give rise to a twodomain enzyme: one in the lineage leading to A. gambiae
and one in the urochordate lineage leading to Ciona intestinalis (Fig. 5). That is, two-domain ACE proteins have
been selected for on three separate occasions, suggesting
that there is a distinct functional advantage to having two

BMC Genomics 2005, 6:172

active sites organised in this manner over two singledomain proteins. Support for this hypothesis comes from
several studies on mammalian sACE that suggest that the
two active sites can have cooperative effects on ACE activity [5-7]. Recent studies indicate that the N-domain of
human somatic ACE also has a negative effect on the shedding of the protein from the cell surface by cleavage
within the stalk region that separates the C-domain from
the membrane anchor [28]. More detailed biochemical
studies on AnoACE9 are now required to determine
whether similar cooperative phenomena occur in mosquitoes.
The expression of AnoACEs 3, 7 and 9 is induced by a
blood meal. Two of these genes (AnoACE 3 and 7) are
induced more than ten-fold. Neuropeptides are known to
be important for mediating several behavioural and physiological responses to a blood meal in mosquitoes [2934]. Our previous work showing that ACE inhibitors
block egg-laying, but not egg development, in blood fed
A. stephensi [19] led us to propose that the elevated peptidase activity might be important for regulating a peptide
signal involved in egg-laying. The up-regulation of
AnoACEs 3, 7 and 9 following a blood meal in A. gambiae,
raises the possibility that ACE may also be involved in regulating post feeding oviposition in this species.
A role for at least some AnoACEs in the immune response
is suggested by recent microarray data [35]. AnoACE7
(ENSANGT00000022325) was shown to be 2.4-fold
upregulated by challenge with Salmonella typhimurium.
AnoACE1 (ENSANGT0000010993) was 3.5-fold upregulated by Staphylococcus aureus infection, whereas the
expression of AnoACE9 (ENSANGT00000028617) was
reduced 2.4-fold by Beauveria bassiana. We were unable to
detect AnoACE1 expression in a variety of developmental
stages. However, the expression of this gene suggested by
the infection microarray may mean that this gene plays a
specific role as a component of the immune response.

Conclusion
The Anopheles gambiae genome contains 9 genes coding
for proteins with similarity to mammalian ACE. Six of
these genes are found in a tandem cluster situated at 35C
on chromosome 3R. Five of the members of this cluster
code for proteins which are similar to previously
described insect ACEs: they contain a single active site
domain and lack a C-terminal hydrophobic region.
AnoACE7, situated at the 3' end of the 35C cluster, is an
orthologue of Drosophila Ance-3 and of Apis gene
ENSAPMG00000014390. In all three species, there is a
similar gene structure with the bulk of the coding exons
separated from the C-terminal exons by a large intron
which contains other genes. The AnoACE7 protein, like
Drosophila ANCE-3, has a hydrophobic C-terminus and is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/172

likely to be membrane bound. AnoACEs 8 and 10 are also
predicted to be single domain proteins but AnoACE9 is
unique amongst insect ACEs described so far in that it
contains two active site domains and has a hydrophobic
C-terminus, a structure similar to that of mammalian
somatic ACE. Expression of only 4 of the Anopheles ACE
genes (2, 3, 7 and 9) could be detected by RT-PCR in the
stages tested. Expression of AnoACEs 3, 7 and 9 increased
following a blood meal.

Methods
Insects
Male and female Anopheles gambiae were maintained at a
temperature of 26°C and at a relative humidity of 80 %.
Newly hatched adult mosquitoes were fed for seven days
on sterile 5% (w/v) glucose/0.5% (w/v) p-aminobenzoic
acid solution [20]. On the seventh day female mosquitoes
were harvested and divided into two cohorts. Mosquitoes
in cohort A were maintained on the glucose/p-aminobenzoic acid solution, whilst mosquitoes in cohort B were fed
mouse blood. After the blood meal any unfed female
mosquitoes (from cohort B) were discarded. Mosquitoes
from cohort B were collected 48 hours after the blood
meal. Insects from cohort A were collected 48 hours after
cohort B was given the blood meal.
Extraction of nucleic acids
Nucleic acids were extracted using either the Qiagen
DNeasy® or RNeasy® kits as per manufacturer's directions.
During RNA extraction the optional RNase-free DNase I
from Qiagen® was used to digest DNA. After quantification, extracted DNA was stored at 4°C and RNA at -80°C
until required.
PCR
Primers were designed for each possible mosquito ACE
gene, with each pair crossing exon boundaries, where this
was possible (see Table 1 for primer sequences).

The primers were also designed so that the product size
from cDNA would be approximately 100 bp as appropriate for use with QPCR, except for AnoACE1 where the
product was 943 bp. Amplification reactions were prepared in 20 µl volumes and contained; 100 ng of template, 2 µl of PCR buffer (670 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.8; 166
mM [NH4]2SO4; 67 mM MgCl2), 200 µM of dNTPs, 330
ng of BSA, 0.14 µl of 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 1 unit
of Promega® Taq polymerase, 20 pmol of forward primer,
20 pmol of reverse primer. The following cycling conditions were used: one incubation at 94°C for 5 min; 35
cycles of 94°C for 30 s; Tm for 30 s; 74°C for 1 min: followed by one incubation at 74°C for 5 min (where the Tm
is appropriate for each set of primers).

RT-PCR
To amplify the 5' end of AnoACE7, cDNA was prepared
using an Invitrogen Cloned AMV kit as per the manufacturer's instructions. Using 2 µg total RNA from blood fed
A. gambiae and 10 mM gene specific primer (ACE7 REV:
5'-GTCTATTCGGCGCATTTGAT-3'), first strand synthesis
was performed at 50°C for 1 hour. PCR was then carried
out using 1 µl of the first strand reaction, 2 mM dNTPs,
0.5 mM each primer (ACE7 REV and ACE7 FOR3: 5'-AGTGAAAACGTAACCATTGCAGAA-3') and 2.5 units Proofstart enzyme (Qiagen). PCR conditions were as follows:
initial denaturation at 95°C, 5 min. then 35 cycles of
95°C for 30s, 54°C for 30s, 72°C for 3 min., and a final
extension at 72°C for 5 min. A 1.1 kb product was purified using the Qiagen® gel purification kit as per the manufacturer's instructions, cloned into pGEM®T-Easy and
sequenced using M13 forward and reverse, and internal
primers. The accession number of this sequence is
[EMBL:AM085517]. For semi-quantitative RT-PCR, first
strand synthesis of cDNA took place in a 20 µl reaction
volume using 1 µg of RNA and Promega ImPromII RT® kit
as per the manufacturer's instructions and either random
or gene-specific primers. PCR was carried out using the
method described above with 2 µl of cDNA, primers as in
Table 1, and the following cycling conditions: 94°C for 5
min. then 35 cycles of 94°C for 15 s, Tm for 15 s, 74°C for
30 s followed by incubation at 74°C for 5 min. PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. To confirm identity of the PCR products, bands were purified
using the Qiagen® gel purification kit, cloned into pGEM®
T-Easy and sequenced using M13 forward and reverse
primers.

curve. The remaining 15 µl of each experimental cDNA
was made up to 400 µl with water. Reactions were performed in duplicate using 10 µl of template, 12.5 µl of
ABsolute™ QPCR SYBR® green and 2.5 µl of primers at a
concentration determined to be optimum for each primer
pair. Reactions were subjected to the following amplification cycles; 95°C for 15 min, once; 95°C for 15 s; 60°C
for 30 s for 40 cycles. Melt curves were also performed to
confirm that a single PCR product and no primer dimers
were produced. The melt curves were performed using the
following conditions; one incubation at 95°C for 30 s,
55°C for 30 s, once; followed by incubation at 55°C for
10 s 82 times, with a temperature increase of 0.5°C every
cycle after cycle 2. Transcript levels of the AnoACE genes
were normalised against the levels of mRNA for the ribosomal protein RPS17, amplified using primers 5'-TTGACCATGGATTTCGACAC-3'
and
5'TGATGGAAATACCACGCACT-3', forward and reverse,
respectively.
