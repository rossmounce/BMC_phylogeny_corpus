Abstract
Background: The database of sugarcane expressed sequence tags (EST) offers a great opportunity for developing
molecular markers that are directly associated with important agronomic traits. The development of new EST-SSR
markers represents an important tool for genetic analysis. In sugarcane breeding programs, functional markers can
be used to accelerate the process and select important agronomic traits, especially in the mapping of quantitative
traits loci (QTL) and plant resistant pathogens or qualitative resistance loci (QRL). The aim of this work was to
develop new simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers in sugarcane using the sugarcane expressed sequence tag
(SUCEST database).
Findings: A total of 365 EST-SSR molecular markers with trinucleotide motifs were developed and evaluated in a
collection of 18 genotypes of sugarcane (15 varieties and 3 species). In total, 287 of the EST-SSRs markers amplified
fragments of the expected size and were polymorphic in the analyzed sugarcane varieties. The number of alleles
ranged from 2-18, with an average of 6 alleles per locus, while polymorphism information content values ranged
from 0.21-0.92, with an average of 0.69. The discrimination power was high for the majority of the EST-SSRs, with
an average value of 0.80. Among the markers characterized in this study some have particular interest, those that
are related to bacterial defense responses, generation of precursor metabolites and energy and those involved in
carbohydrate metabolic process.
Conclusions: These EST-SSR markers presented in this work can be efficiently used for genetic mapping studies of
segregating sugarcane populations. The high Polymorphism Information Content (PIC) and Discriminant Power
(DP) presented facilitate the QTL identification and marker-assisted selection due the association with functional
regions of the genome became an important tool for the sugarcane breeding program.

Background
Sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) is a member of a polyploid
complex belonging to the Andropogoneae tribe in the
Poaceae family. This crop is economically important
because it is the main source of both sugar and alcohol,
and it accounts for two thirds of the world’s sugar production [1]. In Brazil, the production about 625 million tons
of sugarcane is estimated for the 2010/2011 harvest,
surpassing the production of the last harvest [2].
Modern sugarcane cultivars are highly polyploid and
often aneuploid, with chromosome numbers ranging

from 100 to 130 [3]. These modern cultivars are interspecific hybrids derived essentially from crosses between
S. officinarum (2n = 80, x = 10), a species that has stalks
with high sugar content, and S. spontaneum (2n = 40128, x = 8), a wild and vigorous species that is resistant
to several sugarcane diseases. Because of sugarcane’s
interspecific origins and its high polyploid chromosome
number, crosses between different sugarcane varieties
produce aneuploid progeny [4,5]. These characteristics
make the time required for developing new varieties as
high as 12 to 15 years [6], and they represent some of
the main drawbacks in sugarcane breeding programs.
Molecular markers associated with important agronomic traits can be used to help select varieties at early
stages of breeding programs, known as Marker-Assisted
Selection (MAS) and to choose the best parents in a

cross. Therefore, they could facilitate a significant reduction in the time and cost involved to develop new varieties, and they should help to bypass barriers in
sugarcane breeding.
Simple sequence repeats (SSR) or microsatellites are
short fragments of DNA that consist of small motifs of
one to six tandem repeat base pairs that are flanked by
well-conserved sequences, and they allow for the design of
specific primers [7-9]. The SSRs developed from expressed
sequence tags (ESTs) are derived from expressed genes.
The advantage of using ESTs is that they can facilitate the
mapping of genes with known functions pathways [10].
They are also located in the transcribed portion of the
genome [11], which allows for a direct association between
genes and important agronomic traits. ESTs have been
developed for a large number of plant species, including
cotton [12], wheat [13], barley [14], and the rubber tree
[15].
To identify available ESTs, our group used the Brazilian
EST database (Sugarcane EST Project- SUCEST), which
is the largest database of sugarcane ESTs; it contains
237,954 ESTs grouped in 43,000 clusters [16]. Most of
these clusters represent genes associated with important
metabolic processes such as photosynthesis, carbohydrate
metabolism, sugar transport, amino acid metabolism, and
biotic and abiotic stress response mechanisms.
A preliminary analysis involving the development of
functional SSRs markers from the SUCEST database was
reported by Da Silva [17], who identified 20 EST-SSRs
revealing this database as a good source for the development of molecular markers.
In total, our group has developed 837 sugarcane ESTSSRs. Initially were reported the development and characterization of 30 EST-SSRs [18]. Later, developed 100 more
EST-SSRs and compared them with 50 other SSRs derived
from genomic libraries (gSSR) [19]. After, developed 149
additional EST-SSRs [20], and more recently, developed
193 EST-SSRs [21]. In the present article, we develop and
characterize 365 novel EST-SSRs.
The aim of the present work was to characterize 365
SSR sugarcane markers identified in the SUCEST database. Appropriate primers and PCR amplification conditions were developed for each SSR, and their
polymorphism information content (PIC) and discrimination power (DP) were determined. To validate the
newly developed EST-SSRs, the genetic diversity among
18 sugarcane genotypes (15 varieties and 3 species) was
evaluated and the results were compared with previously
reported data that utilized AFLPs and pedigrees [22].

Methods
Plant Material and DNA Extraction

A total of 13 commercial sugarcane varieties (CB 36-24,
SP 79-1011, CB 40-77, IAC 51-205, RB 73-9359, SP 70-

SP 79-6134, SP 79-2312, and RB 85-5536) and two parental varieties (SP 80-180 and SP 80-4966) from a genetic
mapping program [20,23] at Centro de Tecnologia Canavieira (CTC - Piracicaba, SP, Brazil) and one clone from
each of three Saccharum species (IJ76-314, S. officinarum;
Gandacheni, S. barberi; and Maneria, S. sinense) (Table 1)
were used to validate the developed EST-derived markers
and to screen for polymorphic SSRs. The studied germplasm was chosen according to a previous study on sugarcane genetic diversity that utilized AFLP markers and
pedigree information [22]. Genomic DNA was extracted
from 300 mg of lyophilized young leaf tissue using the
method described by Hoisington et al. [24] with minor
modifications.
Development of SSR markers

SSR markers were designed from 2005 sugarcane consensus sequences derived from the SUCEST database (The
Sugarcane EST project), as described in detail by Pinto et
al. [18]. A set of 365 locus-specific primers flanking SSRs
with trinucleotide motifs was designed using the Primer
Select DNAStar ® package software. The primers were
synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) (São
Paulo, SP, Brazil). The criteria used to design the primers
for SSR flanking regions were the same as those
described by Cordeiro et al. [25].
To evaluate the importance of these EST-SSR markers,
they were compared to those in the GenBank database
using BLASTX directly from NCBI. The biological function was identified using the Gene Ontology database.
PCR amplification and EST-SSR visualization

PCR amplifications were performed in 20 μl reaction containing 10× PCR buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM KCl),
2.0 mM MgCl2, 100 μM of each dNTP, 0.2 μM of each
forward and reverse primer, 0.5 U Taq DNA polymerase
(Invitrogen, SP, Brazil), and 40 ng of template DNA. After
an initial denaturation at 94°C for 3 min, DNA fragments
were PCR-amplified for 31 cycles of 1 min at 94°C, 1 min
at the annealing temperature specific to each primer, and
1 min at 72°C; the final extension time was for 2 min at
72°C. The annealing temperature for each primer pair was
determined using a temperature gradient ranging from
50 to 65°C on a PTC-200 thermocycler (MJ Research).
The amplification products were separated by electrophoresis on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels in 1× TBE buffer. To perform the electrophoresis, PCR reaction
mixtures were mixed with equal volumes of loading buffer
(formamide containing 0.8 mM EDTA and traces of bromophenol blue and xylene cyanol) and denatured at 90°C
for 3 min. Samples were then loaded on a pre-heated
S2001 Model (Life Technologies). A 10 bp ladder was
used (Invitrogen, SP, Brazil) as a size standard. The DNA

the probability that two randomly chosen individuals
have different patterns.
Genetic similarity analysis

Statistical analysis
Polymorphism analysis

All segregating unique bands were treated as dominant
markers because sugarcane is a hybrid species that incorporates multiple chromosomes sets that can pair and
recombine freely, that is, with little or no preferential pairing. The data were scored based on the presence (1) or
absence (0) of a band for each of the 18 sugarcane genotypes. Both PIC and DP were obtained for a polymorphism
analysis of each locus. PIC values were calculated based on
the following formula:

PIC = 1 −

where pi is the frequency of the ith allele and the summation extends over n alleles [27]. DP values for the kth
primer were calculated based on the following formula:
I

DPk = 1 −

where N is the number of individuals and pj is the frequency of the jth pattern [28]. PIC was used as a tool to
measure the information that a given marker locus
could provide for the pool of genotypes, while DP was
used as a quantification tool to measure the efficiency of
a given marker for the discrimination of genotypes; i.e.,

To evaluate the genetic similarity among all the genotypes,
the polymorphic bands were used to construct a binary
matrix. The EST-SSR-based genetic similarity (SSR-GS)
among all of the genotypes was estimated according to the
Jaccard’s similarity coefficient [29]. The corresponding
genetic similarity matrix was used to generate a dendrogram based on the Unweighted Pair Group Method with
the Arithmetic Average (UPGMA) algorithm, as suggested
by Sneath and Sokal [30]. All analyses were carried out
using NTSYSpc 2.11X [31]. A bootstrap analysis with
10,000 random samplings was applied to estimate the
reliability of the dendrogram branches using BOOD version 3.0 [32].

Results and Discussion
Development of potentially functional SSR markers

According to the search criteria adopted, a total of 2005
clusters containing SSRs were found in the SUCEST database. These sequences were considered useful because
they contained dinucleotide, trinucleotide or tetranucleotide repeats as described by literature [18]. Oligonucleotide
primer pairs were successfully synthesized and tested for
365 of the ESTs that contained trinucleotide motifs. The
sequences were selected based on the size of the individual
repeat units and the expected homology to known genes.
The EST-SSRs were initially tested in agarose gels to verify
the presence and quality of the product amplification of a
predicted size. Afterwards, the selected EST-SSRs were

Marconi et al. BMC Research Notes 2011, 4:264
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/4/264

screened in 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels to identify
a high-quality banding pattern. The details regarding the
primer pair sequences and the product size of the SSR
motifs for the selected markers are described in Additional
file 1.
The used molecular markers derived from EST is a
strategy that allows a direct mapping interest genes
[19,20,33-35] and the discovery of the functional portion
of the genome [21]. In this study, a large number of
sugarcane ESTs derived from the SUCEST database
were exploited to generate a set of functionally associated markers for sugarcane. Expressed sequences from
sugarcane were used to develop EST-SSR markers that
are expected to improve the detection of marker-trait
associations because they are part of the transcribed
domain of the genome. In recent years, emphasis has
been placed on the development of functional molecular
markers in order to assess variation in wild relatives or
to establish genetic similarities between genotypes for
breeding purposes, it is valuable to have information
regarding the variability of specific gene that potentially
affect important breeding traits.
Functional characterization EST-SSR

Of the 197 ESTs sequences compared to sequences
from GenBank using the BLASTX algorithm, 65.98%
had homology with a known protein and 23.62% had
homology with a putative protein. The remaining
10.40% of the sequences did not possess homology with
any sequence in the database.
The unigenes identified in this study had significant
similarity with genes from other plant species. The majority of the similarities were found to Sorghum bicolor,
Oryza sativa, and Zea mays. The enrichment of similarities with genomes these species is likely because they have
sequenced genomes, a large number of expressed
sequences deposited in databases, and a close phylogenetic
relationship with sugarcane. Data regarding the homologies to each of the EST-SSR markers are shown in Additional file 2.
Ontology has been used in many model organisms to
annotate the function of genes and their products and
may be represented in terms of Molecular Function (MF),
Biological Process (BP) and Cellular Component (CC). We
made notes of the MF and BP for each EST. Based on the
130 ESTs that had homology with a known protein, 97
(74.61%) of these ESTs possessed a known molecular function and/or biological process. Of these, 78 (59.54%) ESTs
possessed a known biological process and 88 (67.18%)
ESTs possessed a known molecular function. The molecular functions most occurring were characterized into the
following groups: binding (42.86%), transcription factor
activity (11.61%) and kinase activity (8.04%). Regarding the
biological processes, the ESTs characterized in this work

Page 4 of 8

are mainly involved in cellular metabolic process (35.63%),
regulation of transcription (18.39%) and transport
(17.24%). The ontology category, based on the molecular
function and biological processes of EST-SSR markers, is
represented graphically in Figure 1. The functional annotation (MF and BP) for each EST-SSR marker is listed in
additional file 2.
We identified several EST-SSR markers that can be associated with genes that play important physiological roles in
plants. Some of the clusters that gave rise to these markers
shared homology with were related to proteins deposited
in GenBank. For example, the SCB207 marker is derived
from an EST with homology to a gene (ERECTA) that regulates the efficiency of sweating. This gene coordinates
sweating and photosynthesis [36] and indirectly influences
productivity. The SCB218 marker is associated with the
acid soluble invertase protein, an enzyme that limits the
accumulation of sugars such as sucrose in the immature
internodes of sugarcane stalks [37]. We also identified
SCB324 and SCB336 as markers associated with the MoS2
protein. MoS2 was identified in Arabdopsis thaliana and
is essential in the innate immune response, especially at
the beginning of the cascade that is activated in response
to pathogens [38]. Finally, the SCB487 marker may be
associated with a gene for sugar transport.
Polymorphism revealed by EST-SSR

A total of 365 primer pairs flanking SSR regions were
designed to detect polymorphisms across the set of 18
sugarcane genotypes (15 genotypes came from a interspecific hybrid Saccharum spp., and the remaining from 3 different species: S. officinarum, S. barberi, and S. sinense ).
In 287 sequences (78.6%) of the total developed, clear,
strong DNA fragments were produced by PCR amplification. The PCR reactions using the remaining 78 (21.4%)
primer pairs failed, resulting in weak DNA amplification
or an unexpected fragment size. Of the 287 selected primer pairs that produced a clear product, 197 (68.6%) were
polymorphic and 90 (31.4%) were monomorphic. The
EST-SSR amplifications revealed high levels of polymorphism and detected 1261 alleles with a range of 2 alleles
(SCB168, SCB180, SCB187, SCB192, SCB193, SCB195,
SCB204, SCB210, SCB231, SCB232, SCB234, SCB240,
SCB241, SCB250, SCB293, SCB302, SCB306, SCB345,
SCB377, SCB377, SCB379, SCB402, SCB405, SCB407,
SCB416, SCB418, SCB445, SCB449 and SCB459) to 18
alleles (SCB344), the mean was 6.4 alleles per EST-SSR
(Additional file 1).
The PIC values ranged from 0.21 (SCB345) to 0.92
(SCB344), and the average PIC was 0.69. The DP was high
for the majority of the EST-SSRs, with an average value of
0.80. A maximum value was found for eight EST-SSRs
(SCB181, SCB246, SCB285, SCB330, SCB334, SCB373,
SCB374 and SCB466) (Additional file 1).

Figure 1 Ontology categories of sugarcane ESTs. ESTs were analyzed using the AmiGO browser in the Gene Ontology (GO) database. The
categories shown are molecular function (A) and Biological Processes (B).

Similar PIC values were reported by Oliveira et al. [21]
using the same set of sugarcane varieties ranged from 0.16
to 0.94 with an average 0.73. While Cordeiro et al. [39],
considering sugarcane Hybrids, S. officinarum and S.
sinense, found PIC values 0.77, 0.68 and 0.70 respectively,
suggesting that most of these markers will be useful in the

assessment of the genetic diversity in sugarcane because of
their high potential for discrimination and genetic
mapping.
The amplification success rate of the EST-SSRs was
78.6% and is similar to those rates reported in previous
studies with sugarcane (60%, [25]; 77%, [18]; 62%, [19];

Marconi et al. BMC Research Notes 2011, 4:264
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/4/264

70%, [21]), barley (64%, [14]), wheat (70%, [40]), white
clover (71%, [41]) and coffee (80.9%, [42]). The remaining (21.4%) primer pairs failed to amplify DNA or
resulted in weak DNA amplification. The amplification
of a larger fragment than expected could reflect the presence of introns within the genomic DNA sequence.
The lack of amplification could reflect the presence of
long introns between the sequences homologous to the
primers in the genomic DNA. Other reasons for a failed
amplification include the absence of the allele or the
divergence of the sequence in the SSR flanking region.
The high values obtained are typical of SSR markers,
and these SSRs may be capable of detecting larger variation as reported in sugarcane gSSRs [19,43] and sugarcane EST-SSRs [18,21]. Most of the markers isolated
will be useful in determining sugarcane parentage and
making clonal assessments; the high levels of polymorphism indicate that they will most likely segregate
in crosses, giving them great potential in use for discrimination and for the construction of genetic linkage
maps.
Genetic similarity using EST-SSR

To test the potential of the EST-SSRs to act as polymorphic markers in genetic studies, allelic data from the
197 EST-SSRs were used to construct a dendrogram

Page 6 of 8

(Figure 2) with the studied sugarcane varieties. Genetic
similarities based on the Jaccard coefficient were calculated with 1023 polymorphic markers amplified by the
EST-SSRs, and they varied from 0.39 to 0.78. The data
generated by these markers were not sufficient to differentiate between the two species Gandacheni (S. barberi)
and Maneria (S. sinense) (0.78), but they could differentiate these two species from S. officinarum. The dendrogram shown in this work is in accordance with the
origin of the analyzed sugarcane varieties because
S. sinense and S. barberi are usually considered natural
hybrids between S. spontaneum and S. officinarum [44].
In general, the clustering of the analyzed genotypes is in
agreement with previous works [18,19,21], validating the
new EST-SSRs. The novel EST-SSR markers developed
in the present work represent a suitable genetic resource
for assessing sugarcane parentage, clonal evaluation,
genetic analysis, and to improve direct estimates of
functional diversity.
By analyzing the dendogram, observed that most genotypes are grouped because sugarcane species share a narrow genetic base. Commercially cultivated sugarcane is an
interspecific hybrid between S. officinarum and S. spontaneum. About 80% of the genome is contributed by S. officinarum, 10% - 15% is contributed by S. spontaneum and
only 5% - 10% is thought to consist of recombinant

chromosomes [45,46]. This may explain why the IJ76-314,
that is a S. officinarum, cannot be placed in any group and
why Gandacheni and Maneria, both S. officinarum, cannot
be distinguished themselves, remaining in the same group.
These results corroborate the observed by Lima et al.
[22], which observed a tendency for the cultivars to
group together with others obtained from the same
cross. For example, the NA56-79 cultivar is associated
with crossings that have generated the cultivars SP791011 and SP71-1406 (Table 1); these cultivars clustered
with a similarity coefficient of around 0.60 (Figure 2).
Another example includes the genotypes SP70-1284 and
RB85-5035. The former is the parent of the cross that
generated the latter (Table 1), and they clustered with a
similarity coefficient of around 0.65 (Figure 2).
