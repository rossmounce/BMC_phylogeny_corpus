Abstract
Background: Inferences about protein function are often made based on sequence homology to
other gene products of known activities. This approach is valuable for small families of conserved
proteins but can be difficult to apply to large superfamilies of proteins with diverse function. In this
study we looked at sequence homology between members of the DJ-1/ThiJ/PfpI superfamily, which
includes a human protein of unclear function, DJ-1, associated with inherited Parkinson's disease.
Results: DJ-1 orthologs in a variety of eukaryotic species cluster together in a single group. The
most closely related group is the bacterial ThiJ genes. These are kinases involved in the biosynthesis
of thiamine, a function that has been dispensed with evolutionarily in most eukaryotes where
thiamine is an essential nutrient. The similarity with other characterized members of the
superfamily, including proteases, is more remote. This is congruent with the recently solved crystal
structures that fail to demonstrate the presence of a catalytic triad required for protease activity.
Conclusion: DJ-1 may have evolved from the bacterial gene encoding ThiJ kinase. However, as
this function has been dispensed with in eukaryotes it appears that the gene has been co-opted for
another function.

Background
Mutations in DJ-1 have been described recently that are
associated with recessively inherited Parkinson's disease
(PD). Evidence to date suggests that the mutations cause
disease by a loss of function mechanism. The reported
mutations either delete several exons and result in an
effective gene knockout [1] or are point mutations that
destabilize the protein [2]. Therefore, the normal cellular
function of DJ-1 is a critical piece of information in understanding how these mutations cause PD. DJ-1 has a
number of reported functions, including cellular transformation [3], transcriptional effects [4], control of mRNA
stability [5] and response to oxidative stress [6,7] and it is

unclear quite how all of these relate to the pathways
involved in PD [8].
One way to understand protein function is to find other
proteins of known function with sequence or structural
homology. This approach has helped in understanding of
other PD proteins; parkin was found to be an E3 proteinubiquitin ligase based on homology to other proteins
with similar domain structures [9]. DJ1 shows sequence
homology to a number of proteins that contain a ThiJ
domain, including protein chaperones [10], catalases [11]
proteases [12,13] and the ThiJ kinases [14,15]. Previous
analyses have suggested that the ThiJ domain may be a
member of the large glutamine amidotransferase (GAT)

superfamily [11]. Crystal structures of DJ-1 [16-20] and
other members of this DJ-1/ThiJ/PfpI superfamily including the protease PH1704 [13] have been reported. The
proteins have an overall α/β sandwich structure, arranged
similarly to the Rossman fold, which is also present in
members of the GAT superfamily [11]. The structure is
similar to another protein of much lower sequence
homology, the E coli chaperone Hsp31 [10,20].
The multitude of functional groupings within the DJ-1/
ThiJ/PfpI superfamily limits our ability to make predictions about the cellular role of the human ortholog. A
putative catalytic cysteine, cys106, is present, which has
led to the suggestion that DJ-1 may be a protease [17].
However, structural data generally argues against DJ-1
having protease activity as the invariant catalytic triad
seen in other cysteine proteases is present but in an unfavorable conformation [18,20]. On the other hand, one
recent report suggests human DJ-1 possesses weak protease activity [21], disputing another claim of chaperone
activity [20]. In an attempt to gain further insight to possible roles of DJ-1 we performed a detailed analysis of several hundred sequences of the DJ-1/ThiJ/PfpI superfamily
members. These include orthologs (sequences that are
separated by speciation) and paralogs, i.e., those that are
separated by other types of rearrangements. Surprisingly,
we found that the nearest homologous sequences are the
bacterial ThiJ genes, suggesting that DJ-1 may have
evolved from thiamine synthesis genes that have been dispensed with in eukaryotes.

Results
Using human DJ-1 as a seed sequence for PSI-BLAST, we
identified 311 sequences of proteins with significant
homology (see additional file 1 for a list of all the
sequences we identified). Within this large group there are
several distinct subgroups supported by bootstrap analysis. Proteins with similar annotations across different species generally clustered together into distinct clades
(Figure 1). Those proteins annotated as DJ-1 clustered
into a specific node that included several eukaryotic species, which are likely to be orthologs of each other. As
expected, primate members (Homo sapiens and Cercopithecus aethiops, 100% identity) clustered together, with
progressively lower similarity to rodent (Rattus norvegicus,
Mus musculus and Mesocricetus auratus; 91–97% identity)
or other vertebrate (Gallus gallus, Salmo salar and Xenopus
laevis; 80–89% identity) homologues. Within each of two
invertebrate species with reported sequences (Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster) there appear to
be two distinct DJ-1 paralogs, each with about 40% identity to the human protein. The closest grouping to the
eukaryote DJ-1 orthologs is the ThiJ family of 4-methyl5(β-hydroxyethyl)-thiazol monophosphate biosynthesis

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/6

enzymes, which we have analyzed in more detail (discussed below).
Outside of the DJ-1/ThiJ group, there are a number of distinct clades that have at least one member whose function
is known. Of these, three can be separated from the DJ-1/
ThiJ proteins by the presence of diagnostic structural elements. Firstly, a series of plant homologues group
together and appear to be paralogs as both have a duplicated DJ-1/ThiJ (Pfam PF01965) domains, as described
Chinese cabbage [22]. These proteins, from Arabidopsis
thaliana and Oryza sativa and Brassica rapa subsp. pekinensis,
are annotated as ThiJ or protease-related, but cluster close
to the ThiJ family. Secondly, there are a number of bacterial proteins containing a catalase domain and a DJ-1/ThiJ
domain. These are large subunit catalases (EC 1.11.1.6),
the structure of one of which has been solved [11].
Thirdly, another prominent clade includes the AraC type
transcriptional regulators from bacteria. These proteins
can be defined by presence of one or more helix-turnhelix (HTH) motifs in the C-terminal portion of the protein. The HTH motif is thought to mediate DNA binding,
whilst the ThiJ-like domain may be an amidase, although
this is unproven.
Other families have a single DJ-1/ThiJ domain with variable extensions at the C- or N-termini. A major grouping
includes two proteases from thermophilic bacteria, PfPI
and PH1704 whose ATP-independent protease activity
has been demonstrated [12,23]. The crystal structure has
been solved for PH1704 [13]. This protein is hexameric,
in contrast to dimeric human DJ-1 and this difference in
oligomer formation is mediated by differences at the Cterminal of the two proteins [18]. The proteases that
grouped together in this analysis all lack the most C-terminal α-helix found in DJ-1, and thus are also likely to be
hexameric, distinguishing them from the DJ-1/ThiJ clade.
Several proteins annotated as sigma cross-reacting proteins cluster together. This family has a unique conserved
composition (91.4% identity) that distinguishes it from
neighboring families. This group also appears to be most
similar to a larger family that includes E coli Hsp31, a
chaperone [10,20], which we have annotated as ThiJ/PfPIlike proteins including chaperones. A Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein, YDR533C, whose transcription is up regulated when yeast cells enter the quiescent state after
carbon starvation or in the presence of misfolded proteins
[24,25], is also present in this larger clade. Further analysis
(see discussion) supports this group as having protease
activities and we have annotated this family as ThiJ/PfpIlike protease/chaperones. How distinct this grouping is
from the PfpI-like proteases is unclear, and they might be
regarded as a single group. However, identity between
these groups is only moderate (approximately 20%),

to level of bootstrap support. Known structures are highlighted along with the corresponding PDB identifier. From this tree it
is clear that the DJ-1 superfamily contains proteins with diverse functions and that the DJ-1 cluster is most similar to the ThiJ
subgroup. Group labels are guided by the annotation of the constituent sequences (for more details see text). Unlabeled clusters had a majority of sequences with unknown or disparate function. Sequence identifiers and files for the construction of this
tree can be found in the supplemental information. Numbers in parantheses indicate percentage identities; the first number
identity within the group, the second is the identity with human DJ-1.

therefore we have annotated them separately (fig 1). The
sigma cross-reacting proteins have a distinct ElbB domain
(COG3155.1), related to ThiJ but having a moderate overall homology. Hence we have kept these as a separate
branch. The structure of a member from E coli has been
solved (pdb entry 1OY1) and is dimeric.
To further assess the similarities and differences between
the DJ-1 and ThiJ families, we extracted the sequences and
realigned them. The resulting cladogram is shown in fig-

ure 2. The member of the prokaryotic ThiJ enzymes with
highest homology to eukaryotic DJ-1 proteins is from
Leptospira interrogans, which has a 42% identity with
human DJ-1. This emphasizes the high degree of conservation between these two groups and indicates that there
is likely to be structural conservation. Figure 3 and 4
shows a multiple alignment of the DJ-1 and ThiJ families.
There are a series of key residues that have been suggested
to be important in DJ-1 function which are well conserved
between these two groups (see discussion).

Discussion
The aim of this study was to compare sequence homologies between the clearly identifiable DJ-1 homologues and
other members of this superfamily whose function or
activity is known. The results of a search using PSI-BLAST
yielded many genes with significant homology to human
DJ-1. We were particularly interested in examining
whether sequence analysis would support the previous
suggestions that DJ-1 is a chaperone [20] or a protease
[21]. Our analysis provides some degree of separation of

members of the DJ-1/ThiJ superfamily with these
functions.
Although human DJ-1 does not contain a strong catalytic
Cys-His-Asp/Glu triad found in proteases such as
PH1704, C106 and H126 have been suggested to contribute a catalytic diad [19]. C106 is absolutely conserved in
all of the ThiJ and DJ-1 sequences, as it is within most
members of the superfamily (data not shown). However,
H126 is conserved only within the DJ-1 family. All higher

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2004, 4

eukaryotic members have an equivalent histidine with the
exception of one of the Drosophila genes, which has a phenylalanine. H126 is probably not involved in catalysis,
based on the 1.1 Å crystal structure [18], and the significance of conservation of this residue is therefore unclear.
Further evidence that the DJ-1/ThiJ families would have
only minor protease activity comes from examination of
the sequence around this conserved cysteine. In the protease family, a consensus sequence AICHGP is found. In
the case of PH1704, the equivalent Cys100/His101 pair
form part of the catalytic triad [13]. In contrast, the equivalent sequence in human DJ-1 is AICAGPT, and is conserved in all DJ-1 homologues. These data are consistent
with the lack of protease activity in different assays
[18,20]. The AICAGPT sequence may, however, contribute to the weak protease activity reported recently in vitro
[21]. E coli Hsp31 has both protease and chaperone activities [20], and contains the sequence SLCHGP. This made
us analyze all the members of the protease/chaperone
family (as annotated in figure 1). The consensus sequence
is [Aliphatic] [Aliphatic]CH [SAG], with the cys/his pair
being invariant. As all known proteases contain adjacent
Cys/His residues whereas substitution with Cys/X is found
in all non-protease members, we predict that most of the
"Hsp31-like proteases/chaperones" will have protease
activity. However, our analysis supports the contention
that DJ-1 has only minor protease activity. Further experimental evidence to assess the physiological relevance of
this weak activity is required.
It should be noted that using PSI-BLAST with human DJ1 as a seed sequence has limitations. DJ1 and related proteins represent part of the much larger type I glutamine
amidotransferases (GATase; Pfam PF00117) superfamily
based on structure and sequence similarities [11]. No type
I GATase enzymes were identified with the methods we
have used. This might not be a substantial limitation as it
is not possible to integrate all members of such large and
divergent superfamilies in a single tree without loss of predictive value [26]. Equally, there may be important groups
of enzymes within the DJ-1/ThiJ/PfPI superfamily, distinct from type I GATases, that have not been highlighted
that could be instructive for finding the function of DJ-1.
An example is the phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine
synthases (FGAM synthases; Pfam PF02700, EC 6.3.5.3).
There are at least 50 enzymes with similar annotations
within the DJ1/PfPI superfamily annotated in the public
database (PF01965 at http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/
Pfam/index.shtml). The public domain superfamily was
constructed using 44 seed sequences, including an FGAM
synthase, and identifies a larger grouping (497 sequences)
than found in our analysis (311 unique sequences). This
is likely due to the generation of a more specific sequence
searching profile than the more broadly inclusive meth-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/6

ods used to form Pfam families. The sequence identity
between FGAM synthases and human DJ-1 is comparable
to those between human DJ-1 and some proteins in the
additional file 1. Therefore, the limits of the DJ-1 "superfamily" are unclear and the dataset generated in this study
may represent the most tractable set of similar sequences
rather than the largest possible grouping.
One area that this analysis has allowed us to highlight is
the degree of conservation of specific residues that are
mutated in PD. As noted previously [1], Leucine 166,
which is mutated to proline, is highly conserved throughout the DJ-2 proteins and ThiJ enzymes (with the exception of a phenylalanine in Fusobacterium nucleatum). It
appears that L166P, in the penultimate α-helix of human
DJ-1, destabilizes the protein [2] perhaps by disrupting
this α-helix. Another putative mutation, A104T [27], is
almost completely conserved throughout all DJ-1 and
ThiJ members. The site of the M26I mutation [28] is also
absolutely conserved in all vertebrate orthologs, although
a Leucine is present in invertebrates and in the ThiJ
enzymes.

Conclusions
Our analyses demonstrate that the eukaryotic DJ-1 and
prokaryotic ThiJ families are closely related. However,
they also demonstrate the difficulty of predicting function
based on sequence. ThiJ was cloned as an enzyme in the
biosynthesis of thiamine in E coli [14,15]. As thiamine is
an essential vitamin for many eukaryotes, presumably
another use for the gene family has evolved. The mechanistic details of the enzymatic reaction of ThiJ have not
been fully elucidated, but it catalyses a phosphorylation
reaction of hydroxymethylpyrimidine phosphate, a precursor to thiamine [14]. An equivalent kinase activity has
not been detected in human DJ-1 [18]. In contrast, human
DJ-1 has been suggested to have either chaperone [20] or
a weak protease activity [21]. A tentative conclusion is that
as ThiJ activity was dispensed with, the eukaryotic DJ-1
orthologs have converged on a function that was present
in one of the archaic paralogs, namely protein chaperone
activity. However, equally feasible is that the major function of DJ-1 is in binding RNA [5] or an unrecognized
function. The role of the conserved cysteine residue, catalytic in other members of the family, is unclear.

Methods
We performed homology search using iterative PSI-BLAST
[29] using human DJ-1 as the seed sequence
(NP_009193.2). PSI-BLAST was performed using default
parameters from the NCBI site. The search converged in 7
iterations and the results were trimmed for duplicates and
hypothetical results. The resulting 311 sequences were
then aligned using CLUSTALW. The results were also
aligned with T-COFFEE [30] and SAM 3.4 [31], neither of

which offered a significant difference in quality (data not
shown).
In order to assess the similarity and quality of subgroups
in this alignment, different trees were first made with
1,000 bootstrap replicates using neighbor joining on all
three alignment methods from CLUSTALW, T-COFFEE
and SAM3.4. Each of these methods gave similar subgroups. Subsequently, the final consensus tree was constructed by maximum likelihood using protpars of the
PHYLIP package (version 3.5 c, distributed by J Felsenstein, Department of Genetics, University of Washington,
Seattle) with 100 bootstrap replicates. This second
method adjusted the position of the subgroups relative to
each other compared with the neighbor joining but did
not change the overall subgroup membership. For figure
2, the TREEVIEW program [32] was used to render the tree
used for figure 1. The subgroup containing human DJ-1
was extracted by removing the most specific tree with
100% bootstrap support containing human DJ-1 and its
neighbors, the ThiJ group. The resultant subgroup was realigned using T-COFFEE and visually inspected and altered
for corrections. One sequence was removed to obtain a
higher quality semi-gapless alignment.
