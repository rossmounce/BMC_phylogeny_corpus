Abstract
Background: While the premise that lateral gene transfer (LGT) is a dominant evolutionary force
is still in considerable dispute, the case for widespread LGT in the family of aminoacyl-tRNA
synthetases (aaRS) is no longer contentious. aaRSs are ancient enzymes, guarding the fidelity of the
genetic code. They are clustered in two structurally unrelated classes. Only lysine aminoacyl-tRNA
synthetase (LysRS) is found both as a class 1 and a class 2 enzyme (LysRS1-2). Remarkably, in several
extant prokaryotes both classes of the enzyme coexist, a unique phenomenon that has yet to
receive its due attention.
Results: We applied a phylogenetic approach for determining the extent and origin of LGT in
prokaryotic LysRS. Reconstructing species trees for Archaea and Bacteria, and inferring that their
last common ancestors encoded LysRS1 and LysRS2, respectively, we studied the gains and losses
of both classes. A complex pattern of LGT events emerged. In specific groups of organisms LysRS1
was replaced by LysRS2 (and vice versa). In one occasion, within the alpha proteobacteria, a LysRS2
to LysRS1 LGT was followed by reversal to LysRS2. After establishing the most likely LGT paths,
we studied the possible origins of the laterally transferred genes. To this end, we reconstructed
LysRS gene trees and evaluated the likely origins of the laterally transferred genes. While the
sources of LysRS1 LGTs were readily identified, those for LysRS2 remain, for now, uncertain. The
replacement of one LysRS by another apparently transits through a stage simultaneously coding for
both synthetases, probably conferring a selective advantage to the affected organisms.
Conclusion: The family of LysRSs features complex LGT events. The currently available data were
sufficient for identifying unambiguously the origins of LysRS1 but not of LysRS2 gene transfers. A
selective advantage is suggested to organisms encoding simultaneously LysRS1-2.

Background
In protein synthesis the rules of the genetic code are established through catalytic aminoacylation of tRNAs by their

cognate synthetases. With some notable exceptions, each
aaRS enzyme acylates a specific amino acid to its cognate
tRNA. Throughout the three Domains of life synthetases

are partitioned into two structurally and evolutionary
unrelated classes (class 1 and class 2 aaRS) [1]. These differ in their secondary structure arrangements, in their conserved sequence motifs composing the active site, and in
the side of the tRNA acceptor stem to which they dock [2].
LysRS is the only known exception to this classification,
aminoacylating tRNA(Lys) by two rather than by one
enzyme: LysRS1 featuring the distinct structure and characteristics of a class 1 aaRS and LysRS2 with the distinct
structure and characteristics of a class 2 aaRS [3]. Structural studies of LysRS1 and LysRS2 complexed with lysine
indicated that in addition to the canonical aaRS class distinctions, the amino acid binding site of LysRS1 is more
compact than that of LysRS2 [4,5].
All known Eukaryotae apparently code only for LysRS2.
Most Bacteria code for LysRS2, but some taxa, predominantly within the class of alpha-proteobacteria, code for
LysRS1. Archaea mostly code for LysRS1, with some
exceptions coding for LysRS2. R.F. Doolittle and J. Handy
[6] predicted that prokaryotes will be found coding for
both types of LysRS by the same organism. For a while this
prediction was not accepted [7,8]. Recently, it was confirmed: the genomes of several mesophilic prokaryotes
were shown to encode both LysRS1 (lysK) and LysRS2
(lysS). Already five such organisms have been identified:
Methanosarcina mazei [9], Methanosarcina acetivorans [10],
Methanosarcina barkeri [11], Bacillus cereus [12] and
Treponema palladium [13].
With continuing increase of complete genome sequencing, there is no compelling reason to doubt that the
number of prokaryotae discovered to code for both classes
of LysRS will rise. The growing database of LysRS1 and
LysRS2 synthesized by various archaeal and bacterial
phyla and sometimes by the same organism motivated us
to address two issues: (1) what are the incidences, patterns
and sources of LysRS1 and LysRS2 LGTs between prokaryotes found in current databases of completely sequenced
genomes; (2) what is the likely explanation for the phenomenon of organisms retaining both classes of LysRS?
To clarify these issues, we reconstructed the relevant
archaeal and bacterial species trees, made the most parsimonious assignments of LysRS classes to the ancestral
nodes of the trees, reconstructed LysRS1-2 gene trees in
order to determine the probable origins of the transferred
genes, reviewed the literature for organisms encoding
simultaneously two varieties of aaRSs, albeit of the same
class, and evaluated the significance of the experimentally
determined distinction between the amino acid binding
sites of LysRS1-2 in the context of the phenomenon of
Archaea and Bacteria encoding both classes of synthetases.
Our analysis of the collected data confirmed that the
extant distribution of LysRS1 and LysRS2 reflects a wide-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/22

spread LGT – characteristic for the entire aaRS family of
enzymes [14,15]. It enabled us to determine some of the
most likely paths and several of the origins of these LGT
events, and to elucidate the probable selective advantage
to several prokaryotes encoding simultaneously both
enzyme classes in the presence of environmentally
dependent LysRS inhibitors.

Results
The evolutionary position of organisms coding for LysRS1,
LysRS2 and both enzymes simultaneously
Except for the Archaeon Cenarchaeum symbiosum whose
genome is still being sequenced, all organisms analyzed in
this study for the reconstruction of the species trees have
had their entire genomes sequenced and annotated. Thus,
there is a reliable assignment for each organism whether it
codes for LysRS1 and/or LysRS2. The assignments for
Archaea and Bacteria are presented in figs. 1 and 2 respectively. The occurrences of LGT events during the evolution
of both Bacteria and Archaea are evident from the fact that
both LysRSs are found in the two Domains (figs 1, 2).
LGTs in Archaea and the LysRS of the last common
ancestor of Archaea
The most parsimonious assignment of LysRS types to the
ancestral nodes in fig. 1 requires a minimum of two LGT
events (marked by arrows in the figure). The majority of
Archaea only code for LysRS1. Indeed, according to the
most parsimonious reconstruction, their last common
ancestor coded for LysRS1. The alternative scenario, in
which the ancestor codes for LysRS2, requires two additional LGT events (fig. 1). The three Methanosarcinales –
M. barkeri, M. acetivorans, and M. mazei – code for both
enzyme classes. Thus, it seems that their last common
ancestor received the gene for LysRS2 via LGT. Since they
are monophyletic, only a single LGT is needed to explain
the presence of both enzyme classes in this group.

The situation is more complex in Crenarchaeota (fig. 1).
In this clade, two families code for LysRS1 (C. symbiosum
and Aeropyrum pernix), and two for LysRS2 (Pyrobaculum
aerophilum and Sulfolobus solfataricus). There are several
possible scenarios that can explain this phenomenon:
1. The common ancestor of P. aerophilum, S. solfataricus
and A. pernix first received a copy of LysRS2, and then lost
its copy of LysRS1. Subsequently, A. pernix received a copy
of LysRS1, and lost its copy of LysRS2 (two gains and two
losses).
2. P. aerophilum after its divergence, gained a copy of
LysRS2, and lost its copy of LysRS1. Similarly, after its
divergence S. solfataricus gained a copy of LysRS2, and lost
its copy of LysRS1 (two gains and two losses).

and LysRS2. Organisms coding for LysRS1 are colored blue,

events.

3. The common ancestor of P. aerophilum, S. solfataticus
and A. pernix received a copy of LysRS2. After the divergence of P. aerophilum, this organism lost its class 1 copy.
The same loss occurred again, after the divergence of S. solfataricus. A third loss, of class 2 occurred in the lineage
leading to A. pernix. This alternative requires one gain, and
three losses.
Among these three scenarios, the third requires the least
number of LGTs. When an organism codes for both
classes of LysRS, a loss event of one copy may be sustainable. Assuming that a loss of one copy out of two is more
likely than a LGT, the third scenario is the most probable
one. It should be noted that all these alternatives rely on
the correctness of the species tree. However, the phylogeny among P. aerophilum, S. solfataricus and A. pernix (fig.
1) was reconstructed with 100% bootstrap support [16].
See section 'Are the species-trees correct?' below for further discussion on the robustness of the species tree.
LGTs in Bacteria and the LysRS of the last common
ancestor of Bacteria
The most parsimonious assignment of LysRS types to the
ancestral nodes in fig. 2 requires a minimum of five LGT
events (marked by arrows in the figure). The majority of
Bacteria only code for LysRS2. It is most parsimonious to
assume that the bacterial ancestor coded for LysRS2 (fig.
2). Among Actinobacteria, some species code for LysRS2
(Mycobacterium leprae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis), and
some code for LysRS1 (Streptomyces coelicolor and Streptomyces avermitilis). The two species coding for LysRS1 are
monophyletic [17]. Thus, it seems that a LysRS1 was laterally transferred to the common ancestor of Streptomycetes
followed by a LysRS2 loss. Within the Firmicutes, B. cereus
codes for both LysRS1 and LysRS2. Since this is the only
known Firmicutae that codes for both types, we conclude
that the LysRS1 was transferred to this species. Within the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/22

Spirochetes clade, Leptospira integrans codes for LysRS2,
while in the second group, including the T. pallidum,
Treponema denticola and Borrelia burgdorferi species, the
last two species code for LysRS1 only, while T. pallidum
codes for both LysRS types. This can be explained by a single LGT event (gain of LysRS1) in the common ancestor of
T. pallidum, T. denticola, and B. burgdorferi, followed by a
LysRS2 loss in T. denticola and B. burgdorferi. Within the
proteobacteria, the beta, gamma, and epsilon clades, all
code for LysRS2. Only within the alpha-proteobacteria
most species code for LysRS1 (Rickettsia conorii, Rickettsia
prowasekii, Wolbachia sp., Sphingomonas aromaticivorans,
Magnetospirillum magnetotacticum, Rhodobacter sphaeroides,
Caulobacter crescentus, Rhodopseudomonas palustris, Brusella
malitensis, Brucella suis, and Mesorhizobium loti). Following
the branching pattern of the Proteobacteria (fig. 2) it
seems that the last common ancestor of the alpha-proteobacteria had gained a copy of LysRS1, and lost its LysRS2.
However, the clade including the rhizobiales Sinorhizobium meliloti and Agrobacterium tumefaciens codes for
LysRS2. Thus, it seems that in the common ancestor of
these species, LysRS2 was regained, and LysRS1 was lost.
This scenario calls for two LGT events and two losses.
Gene trees
Gene trees summarize our current estimation of the evolutionary relationships among the LysRS sequences. Combined with the species tree, gene trees are a valuable
source of information concerning the origins of the laterally transferred genes.

ria to Crenarchaeota is from an ancient ancestor of the
bacterial Domain or from an extinct bacterial lineage that
is an outgroup to most extant Bacteria, or from a yet unidentified bacterium. (2) There is not enough information
to resolve the location of this clade within the LysRS2
gene tree, as is evident by the low bootstrap value. In the
first alternative, it is not very likely that the LGT is from
the bacterial ancestor, as we know that the LysRS2 LGT to
Crenarchaeota occurred after the divergence of C. symbiosum (fig. 1). All these possibilities are likely scenarios and
further bacterial genome sequencing has the potential to
settle this issue.

LysRS2 accession numbers and their sources are also provided in SM, additional file 1. The complete (unabbreviated)
LysRS2 ML trees are given as SM, additional file 3.

The origin of the inferred LGTs in Archaea
The maximum parsimony analysis has indicated that the
ancestor of the Archaea most likely coded for LysRS1. We
reconstructed a LysRS2 gene tree (fig. 3) to track the origin
of the genes that were laterally transferred to the Archaea.
Since our species tree (fig. 2) does not contain all the
known LysRS2 sequences, we used blastp [18] to enlarge
our bacterial LysRS2 database by choosing the first 177
non-redundant sequences – 131 from complete genomes
and 46 encoded by bacteria whose entire genome has not
been sequenced yet. AspRS sequences were used to root
the tree.

The LysRS2 genes of P. aerophilum, S. solfataricus, and Sulfolobus tokodaii, cluster together in the gene tree with a very
high bootstrap value (99%) supporting our conclusion of
a single LysRS2 LGT to the Crenarchaeota clade. This clade
has only a low bootstrap value (36%) with respect to
genes located on other branches of the tree. Two alternatives can explain such a position: (1) The LGT from Bacte-

M. barkeri, M. acetivorans and M. mazei code for both
classes of LysRS. The origin of their LysRS2 gene is in
doubt. The group clusters with the bacterial lineage A.
aquifex with a low bootstrap value (60%). Again, additional genomic bacterial sequencing might shed light on
the history of this LGT event.
The origin of the inferred LGTs in Bacteria
Five LGT events were inferred in the bacterial tree (fig. 2).
A gene tree of LysRS1 sequences encoded by Archaea and
Bacteria was reconstructed in order to infer the origin of
the laterally transferred genes (fig. 4). Several LysRS1
sequences encoded by bacteria whose complete genomes
have not been determined yet – e.g., Bradyrhizobium sp,
Rickettsia sibirica, Borella afzelii – were excluded from this
study due to high percentage identity, 61, 88 and 95%,
between their sequences and sequences of bacterial
LysRS1 utilized for the reconstruction of the gene tree
(from M. loti, R. prowazekii and B. burgdorferi respectively).
GluRS sequences were used to root the tree. The bacterial
sequences of the S. coelicolor, S. avermitilis, B. cereus, B.
burgdorferi, T. pallidum, and T. denticola, together with the
archaeal Thermococcaceae clade (P. horikoshii, P. abyssi and
P. furiosus) cluster together with a very high bootstrap support (99%). Such clustering is indicative of a Thermococcaceal source for the LysRS1 found in all bacterial
sequences excluding the alpha proteobacteria.

The LysRS1 sequences in alpha proteobacteria cluster with
C. symbiosum with a very high bootstrap support (100%).
Thus, C. symbiosum or a related yet undetermined Archaea
is the most likely source for the LGT to alpha proteobacteria excluding the two species A. tumerfaciens, and S.
meliloti. Within the alpha proteobacteria, these two species reversed to a LysRS2 class gene. To infer the origin of
this reversed LGT, we refer to fig. 3. See Discussion, section 'The possible origins of laterally transferred LysRS
genes' below, for details.

Discussion
Most likely scenarios for LysRS LGT
In this study we analyzed the pattern of LysRSs LGT based
on organisms with fully sequenced genomes, coding for
LysRS1, LysRS2, or both. Analyzing this information and
taking into account the evolutionary relationships among
the organisms (the species tree) made it possible to infer
the most likely LGT scenarios. As previously determined
by other researchers for the entire family of aaRS enzymes
[14], we also found that LGT for a particular synthetase –
LysRS – is quite common in both Bacteria and Archaea.
Inferring that the last common ancestors of Bacteria and
Archaea most likely coded for LysRS2 and LysRS1, respectively, a complex pattern of LGT events emerged: LysRS1
was replaced by LysRS2 (and vice versa) in a specific group
of organisms. In one occasion, a LysRS2 to LysRS1 LGT
was followed by a reversed LGT to LysRS2, within the
same group. It should be noted that a transition from one
LysRS to another most probably occurred through an
intermediate evolutionary stage in which organisms
coded for both LysRSs [15]. Examples of extant species
embodying such a stage are the three Methanosarcinales, B.
cereus, and T. pallidum

The LysRS1 and LysRS2 genes coded by T. pallidum probably illustrate an advanced phase of such a transitional
stage: (i) the LysRS2 gene only codes for 351 residues [19].
This region shows a high similarity to the 376 residues of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/22

the E. coli LysRS2 catalytic domain located in the COOHterminal region. However, the 144 residues at the NH2terminal region in the E. coli enzyme, which includes the
80 residues of the tRNA (Lys) anticodon binding domain
that are critical for the enzyme's acylation activity, are not
coded in T. palladium [13]. The observed lack of the
LysRS2 anticodon binding domain is the result of a
LysRS1 gene entering the common ancestor of T. palladium and B. burgdorferi by LGT from an archaeal lineage
[20]. LysRS1 proved by some measure more advantageous
to Treponema than LysRS2. The latter became non-functional, subject in the course of evolution to gradual elimination from the genome accompanying the loss of
function.
Are the species-trees correct?
Our results depend on inferred species trees that might
not be the true ones. Nevertheless, they do not rely on the
existence of clades with low statistical support. For the
archaeal tree (fig. 1), M. barkeri, M. acetivorans, and M.
mazei which code for both LysRS1 and LysRS2 are monophyletic [21]. Further, their clustering with Hallobacterium
is supported with high bootstrap values [22]. The phylogenetic position of P. aerophilum, S. solfataricus and A. pernix is also generally accepted [16]. For the bacterial tree
(fig. 2), there is wide agreement regarding the monophyly
of alpha-proteobacteria and the monophyly of Spirochetes
[23].
The possible origins of laterally transferred LysRS genes
We determined seven LGT events – two in Archaea and
five in Bacteria. One of the main difficulties in the inference of the origins of LGTs is that such inference heavily
relies on a gene tree. A gene tree is always reconstructed
from a single gene, and hence, based on a limited amount
of data. Thus, the bootstrap values for various bifurcations
in the tree are usually not very high. It is well known that
increased taxonomical sampling improves such inference
[24]. To this end, we reconstructed the LysRS gene trees
from an extensive database of extant Bacteria and Archaea.
Not surprisingly, we could not reliably infer the origins of
the two LysRS2 LGTs to Archaea (figs. 1 and 3). Encouragingly, the possible origins of four of the bacterial LGTs
(Actinobacteria, B. cereus, alpha-proteobacteria and Spirochetae) were determined with a high degree of confidence
(figs. 2 and 4). For example the archeal Pyrococci clade
seems to contain the closest LysRS1 sequences to those of
bacterial species (fig. 4). Yet, the details of the LGT events
are still unknown: These species are hyperthermophiles,
inhabiting environments with extremely high temperatures such as undersea hot vents, whereas all the above
mentioned bacteria are mesophiles. The physiological
and biochemical conditions that promoted such an evolutionary event remain an enigma.

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:22

The last intriguing question concerns the LGT reversal of
two alpha-proteobacterial species (A. tumefaciens and S.
meliloti) to code for LysRS2. The bootstrap value clustering
them with other bacteria is very low (39% with Dehalococcus ethenogenes, see SM, Additional file 3). As both species
are capable of nitrogen-fixing [25,26], we speculate that
an extinct nitrogen fixing bacteria may have been the origin of the LysRS2 LGT.
Additional sequences of bacterial LysRS2 genes are likely
to shed new light on the evolution of the LysRS2 LGT
events for which the origin remains uncertain. It is
remarkable that the sources of LysRS1 LGTs are readily
identifiable while those for LysRS2 remain, for now,
shrouded in uncertainty.
Possible advantages for organisms coding for both LysRS
classes
Long before the discovery of Archaea and Bacteria coding
for both LysRSs, it was found that some prokaryotes code
for two paralogous genes for some synthetases: lysS and
lysU in E.coli , thrSv and thrS2 and tyrS and tyrZ, in B. subtilis [34,35]. Recently, co-existing forms were published
for SerRS1/SerRS2 and TrpRS1/TrpRS2 in C. acetobutylicum, CysRS1/CysRS2 in M. tuberculosis, TrpRS1/TrpRS2 in
E. faecalis [14] and GluRS1/GluRS2 in more than 30 bacterial genomes [14,27-31]. While only some of the functions of the observed redundancies have been
determined, it is noteworthy that in some cases it was
found that the aaRS duplications render a selective advantage to the affected organisms providing protection
against potentially detrimental effects on protein synthesis caused by amino acid competitors [32].

One example is the Streptococcus pneumoniae coding for
two distantly related MetRS genes. It was found that one
of them proves necessary and sufficient for resistance to
MetRS inhibitors [33]. Another example is the existence of
two IleRS variants in Pseudomonas fluorescens. This gamma
proteobacterium produces the anti-bacterial agent pseudomonic acid (mupirocin), which if not neutralized,
competitively inhibits the acylation of tRNA(Ile) with isoleucine, thereby shutting off protein synthesis and arresting cell growth. P. fluorescens avoids self destruction by
one of its IleRS variants binding preferentially to isoleucine, with a remarkably high insensitivity to mupirocin
[34].
A related selective advantage is surmised for the prokaryotes coding for both classes of LysRS by the same organism.
In the case of LysRS1 and LysRS2, there is evidence that
the former is less sensitive to inhibitors, due to the active
site of LysRS1 being more compact than that of LysRS2
[4], i.e., LysRS1 is less accommodating to lysine analogues
with backbone substitutions compared with LysRS2 [5].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/22

This bequeathed a possible selective advantage to B. cereus
and T. pallidum after acquiring a copy of LysRS1: harmful
lysine-analogues to LysRS in the environment bind preferentially to LysRS2, leaving LysRS1 available for unimpeded acylation of lysine to cognate tRNAs. What could be
the possible selective advantage for the Methanosarcinales
acquiring LysRS2? Comparing the rate constants (kcat) of
LysRS1 and LysRS2 reveals that LysRS2 has a substrate
turnover speed more than 15 times greater than that of
LysRS1, while their Michaelis constants (Km) values are
practically the same [35]. Therefore, we hypothesize that
the selective advantage for coding LysRS2 is in their
enhanced ability for protein synthesis. Thus, it is possible
that Bacteria and Archaea coding for the two types of
LysRS, in fact, developed a "safety net": in the absence of
LysRS inhibitors, LysRS2 is expected to be the dominant
active form. In the presence of inhibitors, LysRS1 provides
a means for continuing protein synthesis.
Noteworthy, recently it was determined that in B. cereus
LysRS1 and LysRS2 aminoacylate two tRNA species: the
canonical tRNA(Lys) and a smaller RNA annotated
tRNA(Other), which features a tryptophan anticodon
(CCA) with a non-canonical secondary structure.
tRNA(Other) was found to be synthesized only in the
presence of both LysRSs, which act together during
tRNA(Other) aminoacylation. This process is confined to
the stationary phase, suggesting a role in growth-phasespecific protein synthesis [47].

Conclusion
The LysRS family of enzymes has undergone several complex LGT events. The currently available data were sufficient for unambiguously identifying the origins of LysRS1
but not of LysRS2 gene transfers. The LGT transition stage
of simultaneous encoding LysRS1-2 by several Archaea
and Bacteria may confer a selective advantage in the presence of environmentally dependent LysRS inhibitors.

Methods
Data collection
LysRS1-2 sequences were retrieved from public databases:
the Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases database (aaRSDB) [19],
the National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI) [36], the Swiss-Prot Protein knowledgebase/
TrEMBL Computer-annotated supplement to Swiss-Prot
[37]. 16S rRNA and 23S rRNA sequences were retrieved
from the same public databases, and in addition from the
Joint Genome Institute, Microbial Genomes (JGI) [38],
the Ribosomal Database Project II [39] and the European
Ribosomal RNA Database [40]. Additional bacterial
LysRS2 sequences were obtained using NCBI Protein-protein BLAST (blastp) [41], seeded by A. tumefaciens LysRS2
[NCBI: NP_534951]. Additional file 1 provides a listing of

Authors' contributions

Reconstruction of the Archaea species tree
Species tree for 19 Archaea was based on [21,22]. It incorporates the two major phyla of the Kingdom – Crenarchaota and Euryarchaeota - and most of the representative
genera in each phylum. The conspicuous exception was
the absence of the psychrophilic crenarchaeon Cenarchaeum symbiosum. Its phylogenetic position was obtained
from [42]. The tree is given in fig. 1.

Additional material

Reconstruction of the Bacteria species tree
Species tree for 43 Bacteria was based on [43], which
includes the major phylogenetic relationships among
phyla of the Kingdom. The phylogenetic position of most
genera was obtained from the 16S rRNA based reconstruction provided in [44]. Of special interest for us were the
positions of the genera within the alpha proteobacteria,
because they include the site for the putative LGT event
involving A. tumeficiens and S. meliloti. Specifically, the
phylogenetic relationships among A. tumeficiens, S.
meliloti, B. Suis, and M. Loti inferred in [44] were different
depending on the gene used for the reconstruction (16S
rRNA or HSP70). We therefore utilized the 23S rRNA
database [39] to reconstruct a neighbor joining [46] tree
of alpha-proteobacteria (with 100 bootstrap replicates)
and compared the results with those given in [44]. In this
reconstruction A. tumeficiens and S. meliloti clustered
together with very high bootstrap support (in agreement
with fig. 2b of [44]), and hence they are grouped together
in fig. 2. We also utilized the 16S rRNA gene database [40]
to reconstruct a neighbor joining proteobacterial phylogenetic tree with 100 replicates bootstrap, and compared
our results with the trees in [23,43]; The referenced and
obtained trees were in agreement (not shown).
Reconstruction of the gene trees
Gene trees for LysRS2 and LysRS1 with bootstrap support
values (100 replicates) were reconstructed using maximum likelihood (ML) as implemented in the PHYML
software [48]. Among site rate variation was modeled
using a gamma distribution with 4 discrete categories.
Similar results were obtained using the neighbor joining
reconstruction method [43] (data not shown). ML trees
with bootstrap value support are presented in figs. 3 and
4, respectively. To enhance the presentation of the entire
(voluminous) data, in these two figures many Bacteria
and Archaea are grouped under common headings, in
conformity with the presentation in the complete (unabbreviated) LysRS2 and LysRS1 ML trees, given as SM, additional files 3 and 4 respectively.

SS and TP analyzed the data, prepared the figures and contributed to writing the manuscript, RN initiated the study
and contributed to the writing of the manuscript.
