MISHIMA - a new method for high speed
multiple alignment of nucleotide sequences of
bacterial genome scale data
Kirill Kryukov1,2, Naruya Saitou1*

Abstract
Background: Large nucleotide sequence datasets are becoming increasingly common objects of comparison.
Complete bacterial genomes are reported almost everyday. This creates challenges for developing new multiple
sequence alignment methods. Conventional multiple alignment methods are based on pairwise alignment and/or
progressive alignment techniques. These approaches have performance problems when the number of sequences
is large and when dealing with genome scale sequences.
Results: We present a new method of multiple sequence alignment, called MISHIMA (Method for Inferring
Sequence History In terms of Multiple Alignment), that does not depend on pairwise sequence comparison. A new
algorithm is used to quickly find rare oligonucleotide sequences shared by all sequences. Divide and conquer
approach is then applied to break the sequences into fragments that can be aligned independently by an external
alignment program. These partial alignments are assembled together to form a complete alignment of the original
sequences.
Conclusions: MISHIMA provides improved performance compared to the commonly used multiple alignment
methods. As an example, six complete genome sequences of bacteria species Helicobacter pylori (about 1.7 Mb
each) were successfully aligned in about 6 hours using a single PC.

Background
Alignment of vast number of nucleotide sequences is
one of the central problems in current genomic studies.
Sequence alignment is used in many kinds of biological
studies, including phylogenetic analysis, identification of
conserved domains, prediction of protein structure and
database searches.
Alignment of multiple sequences remains a considerable challenge in terms of computation time required to
complete an alignment of a reasonably large sequence
dataset. Even pairwise sequence alignment becomes
hard when the sequences are very long. Most alignment
algorithms use some sorts of heuristics to reduce the
computation time. Every alignment method was
designed with some expectations on the size of data to
be analyzed and what sort of computer hardware is
likely to be used. The progress in alignment techniques

during the last 30 years would not be possible without
the parallel constant improvement in computer technology. The alignment methods being developed these days
work better than those of 20 ago partly just because
they are designed to run on faster processors and use
more memory.
The most simple and widely used such heuristic is the
method of progressive alignment [1], which was
employed in a number of alignment programs such as
MULTALIGN [2], MULTAL [3], MultAlin [4], CLUSTAL W [5,6], and MUSCLE [7]. Under the idea of progressive alignment, first the sequences are compared
pairwise, one to one. Each pair of sequences is aligned
with the dynamic programming algorithm, and the evolutionary distance between the sequences is estimated.
Based on those distances the phylogenetic tree is constructed and then used for building multiple alignment.
An alternative approach to solve the problem of multiple sequence alignment is the iterative procedure of
refining the global alignment, for example in PRRP

program [8]. Also a genetic algorithm for multiple
sequence alignment was proposed [9]. MAFFT package
[10] contains both progressive and iterative alignment
methods, depending on a novel approach of finding homologous regions with the help of fast Fourier transform.
Another direction focuses on increasing the performance of traditional dynamic programming based methods. This includes Divide-and-Conquer techniques,
implemented in DCA [11] and OMA [12]. There are
also studies attempting to take advantage of the parallel
computation, especially popular for progressive alignment techniques like CLUSTAL W [13-15].
Recently it became popular to locate regions of local conservations before attempting to construct the global alignment. This idea was used for pairwise alignment in
MUMmer [16], Shuffle-LAGAN [17], Avid [18] and GSAligner [19]. For multiple sequences a similar technique
was used in DIALIGN [20], CHAOS [21], and MAFFT [10].
While there is considerable progress in recent multiple
alignment research, it still remains a challenging problem to align multiple genomic sequences. Therefore we
investigated an non-conventional heuristic approach to
multiple sequence analysis, which we present in this
work. A prototype of MISHIMA was briefly introduced
by Kryukov and Saitou [22].

Implementation
Extraction of important information

It is believed that only a certain part of a genome is functional, and most of the genome content is never
expressed or used. As a result some parts of the genome
remain mostly unchanged during the evolution, while
other parts quickly accumulate mutations through neutral
evolution [23]. Conserved parts of the genome can be
very helpful in identifying homology. If we could quickly
locate conserved areas in the genome, that information
obtained could be used to assist the process of alignment.
This idea has already been implemented in other methods, in which homology was first detected by pairwise
sequence comparison and the obtained information was
then used to build the alignment (DIALIGN [20], MLAGAN [24]). However for large genomic sequences the
pairwise comparison step is very time consuming. Also
pairwise comparison does not reveal features shared by
multiple sequences. On the other hand, it is often the
case that several sequences share some regions of high
similarity. We propose a new heuristic method for locating conserved patterns shared by multiple sequences that
can be directly used in a sequence alignment procedure.
Divide-and-Conquer approach

Rearrangements of DNA fragments are known to happen very rarely in the evolutionary process, once
sequences started to evolve independently in different

Page 2 of 14

species. Majority of the mutations result from substitutions or insertion/deletion events. Therefore in most
cases it is a valid approach to use divide-and-conquer
procedure for sequence alignment. Its principle is that
sequences can be split into parts that will be aligned
independently and a complete alignment will finally be
constructed by assembling the partial alignments
together [11,25].
The main difficulty in this method is to find the splitting points. The DCA program uses a pairwise sequence
comparison with a dynamic programming-based method
to find the splitting positions [25]. However the cost of
pairwise comparison increases rapidly with the increase
of sequence length and/or number of sequences. Below
we propose a more rapid method to find the splitting
positions.
Once the sequences are divided into sufficiently short
segments, these segments can be aligned by calling a
conventional alignment program. DCA uses MSA alignment program [26,27] to align the parts of sequences. In
this study we use CLUSTAL W [6] and MAFFT [10] to
align the sequence segments separately.
CLUSTAL W is not suitable for aligning long
sequences or large number of sequences because of high
computational requirements. MAFFT can be very fast
with small datasets, but its computation time increases
rapidly when aligning larger datasets, like complete bacterial genomes. Application of these programs can be
extended to much larger datasets by combining with the
Divide-and-Conquer approach.
It should be noted that such Divide-and-Conquer
approach is not able to detect duplications, inversions
and genomic rearrangements. This approach is valid
under the assumption that all sequences can be aligned
in a linear fashion to each other to form a multiple
alignment.
Using k-tuple frequencies

The core idea of MISHIMA is to analyze k-tuples found
in the original sequences and to evaluate them based on
their frequencies. When a particular nucleotide k-tuple
is found exactly once in each sequence, we consider it
as a likely homology signal. A k-tuple that has its close
variants found once in each sequence is considered to
be less likely, but still possible homology signal. Analyzing all k-tuples up to certain length allows us to select
those k-tuples that represent the most probable homology shared by multiple sequences. These k-tuples can
then be used to anchor the sequences before employing
Divide and Conquer method to complete the alignment.
The basic principle of MISHIMA can be outlined as
follows:
1. Find potentially useful k-tuples based on the number of their occurrences in the sequence data.

Kryukov and Saitou BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11:142
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/142

2. Analyze the potentially useful k-tuples, and select
those that represent most probable local homology.
3. Use the selected k-tuples as anchors, split the
sequences into segments.
4. Align the segments independently from each other.
5. Join partial alignments to complete the final multiple sequence alignment.
Dictionary of k-tuples

As a first step we count the number of occurrences of
each short k-tuple in the original sequence dataset. We
keep this information in a dictionary structure, indexed
by a k-tuple sequence. The number of possible nucleotide k-tuples is 4K, so the maximum k we can use is limited by the amount of memory we can use for the
dictionary. We store k-tuple frequencies as 32-bit numbers, so 4*4K bytes is required to store the frequencies
of all nucleotide k-tuples. This allowed us to use k of 13
and 14 on 32-bit machines.
We found that knowing the number of occurrences of
each k-tuple in the original sequence dataset is not
enough to efficiently decide which k-tuples are more
likely to represent the local homology. Therefore we
decided to also store the number of sequences exhibiting each k-tuple. Additionally we store the index of the
last sequence where the k-tuple was found, which allows
us to collect all the frequencies using single read
through the sequence dataset.
Choosing the right lengths of a k-tuple

Length k is a very important factor affecting the chance
for a k-tuple to be useful for alignment purposes. A random sequence of length L is expected to contain L/4K
occurrences of each k-tuple. Let us take L as A*N,
where N is the number of sequences and A is the average sequence length. The expected number of occurrences for one k-tuple is A*N/4K. Since we are mostly
interested in finding k-tuples with exactly N occurrences
(once in each sequence), an ideal case for this method
would be where A*N/4 K = N, which means A = 4 K .
Thus, to have the best results with this method, the
length of sequences to be analyzed should be comparable to, or shorter than 4K.
This is an intuitive estimation, to give some feeling of
relation between the dataset size and k-tuple’s k. Of
course the real biological sequences, especially those
that we are trying to align, are often not completely random, which suggests that longer sequences can be
aligned if they contain significant homology. Therefore
the capability of MISHIMA to align the real sequences
should be higher than this estimate. But non-conserved
intergenic regions in a genomic sequences may well be
considered as random sequence, and the total size of
such regions in a sequence data is a limiting factor for

Page 3 of 14

MISHIMA. This shows that the length k is the basic
parameter affecting the performance of this method.
Choosing the optimal length of a k-tuple is critical for
the successful alignment. If k is too small, too many
occurrences of each k-tuple will be found. Although to
some extent this depends on the length of the
sequences, it is difficult to predict whether the particular
k is too small or not. Therefore we use all k-tuples with
k from 1 to M in this method. For selecting M - the
upper limit of k - we suggest to depend on the memory
limitation. Most of the steps of the MISHIMA algorithm
are performed in linear time, which makes it practical to
use the largest M allowed by the amount of available
memory.
We ended up using 12 bytes for each k-tuple in a dictionary. The total amount of memory required for dictionary is therefore 12*(4+42+...+4M) bytes. This allows
us to use M of 12, with the dictionary occupying less
than 300 MB of RAM.
Finding seeds

Our initial method of using identical k-tuples shared by
all sequences has a low sensitivity, and we decided to
use inexact matching instead. We do this by updating
the dictionary to include the number of inexact copies
of a k-tuple in the sequence dataset. Our method allows
up to one substitution difference between two k-tuples.
After a k-tuple dictionary is constructed and updated
with inexact match counts, it becomes possible to select
k-tuples which represent potential homology. Potentially
useful k-tuples are defined as those that have one inexact match in every sequence. Such k-tuples, or seeds,
are extracted and saved for further analysis.
The next step is to find the locations of seeds in
sequence data. Locations are extracted in a second read
through the sequence data. It should be noted that this
step also completes in linear time.
In cases where no seeds could be found, the external
aligner is used to align the whole dataset.
Seed compatibility

Now we will introduce measure for compatibility of two
seeds, based on their relative coordinates in sequence
data. For now we will consider only seeds that are
found not more than once in every sequence. If both of
two seeds, A and B, can be found in a sequence, there
are two possible orders: either the coordinate of A is
smaller than that of B, or vice versa. We can mark these
two cases as A->B and B->A.
If all sequences in a dataset exhibit the same order of
seeds A and B, these two seeds are compatible. However, if sequences have these seeds some in A->B order
while some other in B->A order, we can then define an
incompatibility distance as number of sequences, where

Kryukov and Saitou BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11:142
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/142

A and B order is different from the majority case. A distance defined in this way can be effectively used to evaluate the possibility that two seeds together represent a
possible homology signal. This distance is used to construct a maximum non-conflicting set of seeds in the
following procedure.
A constant number of T best seeds is selected (T is
600 in current MISHIMA, because of memory limitations). Then the matrix of size TxT is constructed. Each
cell of the matrix contains the incompatibility distance
between two seeds. In the first step all of the selected T
seeds are included and the matrix contains TxT distance
values. Then the matrix is analyzed to find the sum of
all numbers for every row. This sum corresponds to the
total amount of incompatibility introduced by one seed.
Now the seed which introduces the largest amount of
incompatibility is removed from the set. The matrix is
recalculated and the procedure iterates until no incompatibility is left unresolved. Finally only compatible
seeds remain, which are used as alignment anchors. If
all seeds are mutually incompatible with each other,
there will be still one anchor left after removing the
incompatibility. This anchor is used to divide the
sequences into 2 parts, which are aligned separately.
The number of anchors found in all our example datasets is included in Additional file 1, in *.anchors files.
Iterative procedure of dictionary analysis

After the dictionary step has finished and a set of nonconflicting seeds is selected, the algorithm will have a

Page 4 of 14

set of anchors, connecting the sequences. The sequences
are then divided and regions between the anchors are
aligned independently from each other. After all partial
alignments are complete, they are concatenated to construct a final complete alignment.
Alignment of the regions between the seeds is performed using an external aligner provided the sequences
are short enough. Otherwise MISHIMA is used again
(recursively) to divide the sequences into shorter parts.
The depth of the recursive operation in MISHIMA can
be set with the command line option ‘-max-depth = x’.
Since MISHIMA takes a constant time for each step of
finding seeds and dividing the sequences, using a limited
depth may improve the performance on some datasets.
The overall flow of MISHIMA algorithm is shown in
Fig. 1.
Assessing the alignment speed and quality

The performance of MISHIMA was evaluated on several
example dataset, detailed in the Results section. We
used several popular aligners for comparison: CLUSTAL
W, MUSCLE, MAFFT and MLAGAN. The details,
including version and parameters we used with these
methods, are included in Additional file 1.
For assessing the alignment quality we used the sumof-pairs alignment score [26], based on the pairwise
sequence identity. The score is computed as arithmetic
mean of pairwise identity scores of all sequence pairs in
the alignment. Pairwise identity score is computed as
following: Sij = 100*Mij/L, where Mij is the number of

Figure 1 Procedure of MISHIMA alignment and complexity of each step.

Kryukov and Saitou BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11:142

alignment positions where sequences i and j have the
same nucleotide (not including gaps), and L is the
length of complete multiple alignment (including gaps).
While a simulated dataset is necessary for a serious
discussion of alignment quality, we believe that using
the sum-of-pairs score is sufficient for evaluating MISHIMA’s performance, for the following reasons: 1. Our
main focus is on comparing MISHIMA+external
aligner combination to external aligner alone. 2. We
are mainly interested in verifying whether MISHIMA
would not produce particularly big misalignments; the
simplified score is sufficient for this purpose. 3. MISHIMA is targeting rather closely related sequences,
which means that the correct alignments produced by
almost any method will have about the same score, and
misalignments will result in a noticeable score
decrease.
The sum-of-pairs identity score was computed for all
example alignments produced by MISHIMA and other
methods.

Results and Discussion
Human mtDNA genomes

Complete human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genome
sequences were used as an example of very closely
related sequences. As of July 16, 2009, a total of 4,718
complete human mtDNA genome sequences are available in DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank International Nucleotide
Sequence Database. MISHIMA was able to successfully
align hundreds of such genomes. Computation results
can be seen in Additional file 1.
We measured the time MISHIMA takes for aligning
the whole and partial sequences and compared it with
three popular aligners: CLUSTAL W, MUSCLE and
MAFFT (Fig. 2 and Table 1). Partial sequences (with 2
kb increment) and complete ~16.5 kb sequences were
used to see the effect of sequence length on computation time. A fixed length fragment was cut from the
beginning of each sequence to produce partial
sequences. Note that MISHIMA was using an external
aligner (CLUSTAL W or MAFFT) to align the regions

between the anchors, and their running time is counted
in the MISHIMA total running time. 50, 100, 200 and
400 sequences were compared separately in order to
examine effect of number of sequences on computation
time. Nucleotide diversity for these datasets is within
the range of 0.002-0.003.
CLUSTAL W is the slowest among the compared
aligners, even with [-quicktree] option, followed by
MUSCLE (Fig. 2). Fig. 2 shows that computation time of
MISHIMA and MAFFT increases much slower than that
of CLUSTAL W and MUSCLE. CLUSTAL W took 90100 times longer time for complete mtDNA sequence
alignment than it took aligning 2 kb fragments for all
four cases. MISHIMA alignment time increased only 10
times between 2 kb and full length datasets. MUSCLE
was unable to complete the alignment of 200 and 400
complete sequences. We used two kinds of option sets
for MAFFT; [–retree 1 –maxiterate 0] (shown in
orange) and [–retree 2 –maxiterate 1000] (shown in
blue). Both option sets showed much faster results than
either MUSCLE or CLUSTAL W. MISHIMA is as fast
as MAFFT set at faster option (shown in orange) either
when CLUSTAL W was used (shown in light blue) or
when MAFFT was used (shown in red) as the external
alignment program when 50, 100, and 200 human
mtDNA sequences were compared.
When 400 human mtDNA sequences are compared,
MAFFT set at faster option is clearly faster than MISHIMA. However, if we add [-max-depth = 1] option to
MISHIMA (shown in light blue), both aligners finish in
similar time. Because human mtDNA sequences are
quite similar with each other, good seeds are found in
abundance in the first iteration of dictionary analysis,
and average block length (length of sequences between
two adjacent anchor seeds) is already short enough for
CLUSTAL W usage. Therefore, we recommend using
this option when aligning closely related sequences,
such as sequences from same species.
While the performance of MISHIMA is similar to that
of MAFFT, it should be noted that only high similarity

regions are aligned by MISHIMA, and the lower similarity parts are aligned with an external alignment program
- either CLUSTAL W or MAFFT. This means that when
CLUSTAL W is used as an external aligner, the alignment quality will be close to that of the CLUSTAL W
complete alignment. Fig. 3 shows sum-of-pairs alignment
score [26] of all alignments compared. MISHIMA alignment tends to have higher score than alignments produced by CLUSTAL W or MAFFT alone.
We also tried MLAGAN [24] on these datasets, but it
did not work well, either producing corrupted alignment, or taking very long time (even compared to
CLUSTAL W). Therefore MLAGAN results are not
included in the figures.
Mammalian mtDNA genomes

MISHIMA is powerful for aligning closely related
nucleotide sequences, as shown in the above section. If
more divergent sequences are compared, how does MISHIMA perform? We thus retrieved complete mtDNA
genomes from various order of mammalian species.
Average nucleotide difference for these datasets are
within the range of 0.25-0.27.
Alignment times taken by MISHIMA (with various
settings), CLUSTAL W, MUSCLE, and MAFFT for
aligning datasets of 50, 100 and 200 complete mtDNA
sequences are shown in Table 2. Scaling of the alignment time depending on sequence length is shown in
Fig. 4: MISHIMA+MAFFT combination is the fastest,
followed by MAFFT alone, MISHIMA+CLUSTAL W,
MUSCLE. CLUSTAL W is much slower. MUSCLE
could not complete the alignment of 200 complete
mtDNA genomes. MLAGAN results are not shown,
since it was not able to produce the alignment even for
2 kb fragments.
If we compare computation times shown in Table 1
and Table 2, those of MISHIMA are certainly much
slower for different mammalian species than for human
individuals; 23 times and 13 times more for 50 and 100
sequences, respectively. This is because the number of
good seeds for anchoring is reduced as sequence divergence increases. Computation results can be found in
Additional file 1.
MISHIMA greatly accelerates the aligner that it is
using: MISHIMA+CLUSTAL W is much faster than
CLUSTAL W alone, MISHIMA+MAFFT is faster than
MAFFT alone. Is this achieved by sacrificing the alignment quality? Fig. 5 shows the alignment score of all
finished alignments. MISHIMA+CLUSTAL W score is
about the same with the score of CLUSTAL W alone,
also MISHIMA+MAFFT score is similar to score of
MAFFT alone. Thus, the improvement in computation
time is not achieved at the expense of alignment quality.

Complete genomes of four different strains of bacteria

We are now moving from mtDNA genome sequences to
much larger bacterial genomes. We first chose 4 strains
of Streptococcus pyogenes as example. Each genome is
about 2 MB, so the total dataset size is about 8 MB.
CLUSTAL W could not produce the alignment even
after 15 days, and computation was aborted. In good
contrast, MISHIMA+CLUSTAL W could successfully
produce the multiple alignment of these four genomes
in less than three hours. In the course of alignment the
dataset was separated into 485 segments, divided by 484
seeds. The average length of one segment was about

4kb, which is much easier to align than complete
sequences.
We used various values for [-max-depth = N] option:
unlimited depth (default), 1, 2, and 3. Computation times
for each case are shown in Table 3. Adding [-max-depth
= 1] reduced the computation time in the case of 400
human mtDNA genome sequences (see Table 1), while
activating this option for alignment of 4 genome
sequences of Streptococcus pyogenes strains resulted in 3
times slower computation. As the number of iterations
increased, computation time was reduced, and the computation time for the case of [-max-depth = 3] was

slightly shorter than default unlimited depth (Table 3).
With [-max-depth = 1] (number of recursive uses of
MISHIMA anchoring algorithm is set to only 1), some
sequence blocks may be quite long, and external aligner
may take very long time aligning such blocks. Computation results can be seen in Additional file 1.
In any case, it is clear that MISHIMA can be used to
align multiple complete bacterial genomes, as long as
they are closely related. The alignment of four strains of
Streptococcus pyogenes revealed several large insertions

and deletions, some more than 10 kb long. If one is
interested in quickly finding such large deletions, we
recommend use of [-align-seeds-only] option, so that
the external aligner is not activated. In this way only
seed anchoring is conducted, which is much faster (only
27 seconds in S. pyogenes example) than producing full
multiple alignment.
Complete genomes of six different strains of bacteria

We then moved to a more complex dataset - 6 complete
genomes of different strains of Helicobacter pylori - each
about 1.7 MB. Average nucleotide difference of the dataset is 0.133. Neither CLUSTAL W, MAFFT nor MUSCLE were able to complete the alignment even after
3 days. Therefore we decided to also run tests on

fragments of these genomes; we chopped 200 Kb from
the beginning of every sequence, then 400 Kb, 600 Kb,
and so on, until 1.6 Mb. The computation time of various methods can be seen in Fig. 6, and alignment score
is shown in Fig. 7. MUSCLE was unable to align even
the 200 Kb dataset, while CLUSTAL W took 42 hours.
MAFFT managed it within 3 minutes - faster than MISHIMA which took 21 minutes with default settings.
However, as longer fragments were attempted, MAFFT
was slowing down rapidly. With 600 Kb fragments MISHIMA was 2 times faster than MAFFT at its fastest setting [–retree 1 –maxiterate 0]. At the 1.2 Mb length,
MISHIMA was more than 6 times faster compared to
MAFFT (Fig. 6). This time we could also use MLAGAN,
which performed very fast in this dataset. The alignment
score of MISHIMA is comparable to that of other methods (Fig. 7).
MISHIMA+MAFFT combination performed well on
this dataset. Adding options [-max-depth = 1] and
[-max-depth = 2] allowed to save time and improve the
alignment score with this dataset.
Larger datasets

We tried MISHIMA on larger bacterial datasets. We used
fragmented sequences of 14 genomes of Staphylococcus

aureus. CLUSTAL W, MUSCLE and MAFFT were taking
too long time to align this dataset. MLAGAN was still
able to produce the alignment. MISHIMA was operating
with the default options in this example, using MAFFT
as an external aligner. MISHIMA and MLAGAN alignment times are comparable to each other with partial
datasets. When increasing the alignment length, MISHIMA+MAFFT combination becomes faster (Fig. 8).
Interestingly, MISHIMA alignment time starts to
decrease when the sequences are getting closer to complete
genome. The reason is that more complete sequences
allow for the construction of a set of anchors that leaves

smaller unaligned sequence block in the end. This effect is
particularly apparent with 14 sequences (Fig. 8).
The alignment score does not show any big problems
with MISHIMA alignment (it is usually higher than that of
MLAGAN alignment, Fig. 9). So we can conclude that
MISHIMA does not sacrifice the alignment quality for fast
computation.
At present, we were not able to compare the time
and score of MISHIMA+MAFFT with just MAFFT,
however from previous examples we have seen that
MISHIMA+MAFFT alignment is similar in quality to
MAFFT alignment. Thus by using MISHIMA we can

produce MAFFT-quality alignment even for large datasets where we can’t use MAFFT alone.
This example shows that MISHIMA is effective on
large datasets, including those that are very difficult to
align with other programs.
Random sequences

Multiple alignments should be conducted on homologous sequences. However, there will always be a possibility of non-homologous sequences being erroneously
included for multiple alignment. It is therefore ideal to
detect such non-alignable sequences instantaneously and
MISHIMA can do just that. We demonstrate MISHIMA’s ability to detect unalignable sequences by using
random sequences. Two sets of random sequences (50
and 100 sequences of 20 kb length) were generated using

newly built random sequence generator (K. Kryukov,
unpublished). We used MISHIMA with [-align-seedsonly -max-depth = 1] options. As expected, MISHIMA
could not detect any seeds, which is a good indication
that the data is very hard or impossible to align. Quick
examination of the result confirmed that the sequences
could not be aligned. MISHIMA took only 13 and 15 seconds to produce the results for 50 and 100 sequences,
while CLUSTAL W took hours trying to align these random and non-homologous sequences (Table 4).
We therefore recommend to first try using MISHIMA
with [-align-seeds-only -max-depth = 1] options on new
data. By this way you will be able to quickly know if
there are any problems with the sequences. If MISHIMA was able to find seeds and produce a rough
alignment, then the sequences are fine and normal

MISHIMA alignment procedure can be used. In fact,
computation times using this option set for human
complete mtDNA genomes are 00:00:18, 00:01:15, and
00:14:38 for 50, 100, and 200 sequences, respectively.
When [-max-depth = 1] option is also activated, computation times for 200 and 400 sequences are 00:00:51 and
00:02:27, respectively. These are much shorter than
MISHIMA default for producing full multiple
alignments.

Conclusion
We developed a heuristic method for multiple sequence
alignment that can greatly speed up alignment of large
datasets - those consisting of hundreds of sequences, as
well as those with very long sequences, such as complete bacteria genomes.
MISHIMA depends on either MAFFT (default option),
or CLUSTAL W (with [-aligner = clustalw]) for aligning
the areas between the “seeds” to produce the complete

Kryukov and Saitou BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11:142

alignment. However even without other programs MISHIMA can be used to quickly produce a rough alignment where only seeds are aligned. This can be very
useful for quick evaluation of a new dataset before
applying a more thorough alignment procedure.
Given the rapidly increasing number of sequenced
organisms, there is a growing interest in comparing closely related species. MISHIMA is particularly helpful for
such analysis due to its ability to quickly locate homology signals.
