Abstract
Background: Inteins are "protein introns" that remove themselves from their host proteins
through an autocatalytic protein-splicing. After their discovery, inteins have been quickly identified
in all domains of life, but only once to date in the genome of a eukaryote-infecting virus.
Results: Here we report the identification and bioinformatics characterization of an intein in the
DNA polymerase PolB gene of amoeba infecting Mimivirus, the largest known double-stranded
DNA virus, the origin of which has been proposed to predate the emergence of eukaryotes.
Mimivirus intein exhibits canonical sequence motifs and clearly belongs to a subclass of archaeal
inteins always found in the same location of PolB genes. On the other hand, the Mimivirus PolB is
most similar to eukaryotic Polδ sequences.
Conclusions: The intriguing association of an extremophilic archaeal-type intein with a mesophilic
eukaryotic-like PolB in Mimivirus is consistent with the hypothesis that DNA viruses might have
been the central reservoir of inteins throughout the course of evolution.

Background
Mimivirus is the largest known virus, both in particle size
(>0.4 µm in diameter) and genome length, recently discovered in amoeba, following the inspection of a hospital
cooling tower prompted by a pneumonia outbreak [1].
Recently, its entire 1.2-Mbp genome sequence was determined [2]. Extensive phylogenetic studies and gene content analyses defined Mimivirus as a new family of
nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDV) besides
Poxviridae, Iridoviridae, Phycodnaviridae and Asfarviridae,
and suggested its early origin, probably before the individualization of the three domains of life [2].
While analyzing Mimivirus genome sequence, we noticed
the unusual length of its putative DNA polymerase. A

detailed analysis identified an intein in this gene. After the
recent discovery of an intein in Chilo iridescent virus [3],
an insect-infecting NCLDV of Iridoviridae, this is the second report of an intein sequence in a eukaryote-infecting
virus.
Inteins are "protein introns" that catalyze self-splicing at
the protein level. The splicing is defined by the self-catalytic excision of an intervening sequence ("intein") from a
precursor host protein where it is located, and the concomitant ligation of the flanking amino- and carboxy-terminal fragments ("exteins") of the precursor. Inteins often
possess a homing endonuclease domain, and are considered as mobile elements. Since their first discovery in
1990 [4,5], inteins have been identified in a wide variety

of organisms, including bacteria, archaea, and unicellular
eukaryotes, albeit with sporadic distribution (see http://
bioinformatics.weizmann.ac.il/~pietro/inteins/ for a
comprehensive list). For instance, they are relatively abundant in some hyperthermophilic archaea species (such as
Methanococcus jannaschii possessing nineteen inteins), but
absent in closely related species such as Methanococcus
maripaludis [6]. Similarly, they are observed in many unrelated bacterial clades, but appear often limited to several
species within each clade. It was suggested that viruses
were potential "vectors" of inteins across species and
responsible for the sporadic distribution of inteins [3].
Accordingly, inteins have been identified in many bacteriophages and prophages [7-10]. To our knowledge, the
sole published account of eukaryote-infecting viruses harboring an intein concerns iridoviruses [3].

Results

Eukaryotic Polδ-like Mimivirus PolB
Mimivirus genome sequence exhibits a putative ORF
(R322, 1740 amino acid long) corresponding to a family
B DNA polymerase PolB. This ORF R322 exhibits high
scoring sequence homology (BLAST E-value<10-24)
against eukaryotic PolBs in the public database. However,
this Mimivirus PolB is much larger than its eukaryotic and
viral homologues (about 1000 aa), and its optimal alignment with the other PolB sequences reveals four
unmatched extraneous segments (Fig. 1A, Fig. S1). Focusing on these extra segments, we identified a 351-aa intein
(position 1053 to 1403) in the Mimivirus PolB sequence.

After removing those four Mimivirus specific insertions,
the Mimivirus PolB sequence exhibited the highest BLAST
scores (E-value = 10-125, 32% identity) against a soybean
DNA polymerase Polδ (SWISS-PROT: O48901) with an
alignment covering both the entire Mimivirus and the target sequence. Near equivalent matches are observed with
a variety of eukaryotic (from yeast to human) family B
DNA polymerase sequences. The best viral homologues
were found in phycodnaviruses (E-value = 10-116). Conserved carboxylate residues (aspartate and glutamate) at
the exonuclease and polymerase active sites [11,12] were
all identified in the Mimivirus PolB (Fig. S1). There was
no other ORF encoding a putative PolB in the genome.
These suggest that R322 encodes a functional PolB. Consistent with the homology search result, a phylogenetic
analysis places the Mimivirus PolB near the root of
eukaryotic Polδs (Fig. 1B). A similar branching position is
obtained for the seven universally conserved Mimivirus
genes [2]. Despite low bootstrap values for some of the
deep branches in the Fig. 1B, this tree clearly indicates the
lack of any specific affinity between the Mimivirus PolB
and the archaeal PolB sequences containing inteins (bold
letters in the Fig. 1B). It should also be noted that several

http://www.virologyj.com/content/2/1/8

other large DNA viruses are known to possess PolBs with
a similar phylogenetic pattern [13].
Canonical/archaeal type Mimivirus intein
The Mimivirus intein sequence (351 aa) exhibits significant sequence similarities to several known inteins (Evalue<10-4), all of which are from thermophilic/halophilic archaea. The best matching intein (E-value = 3 × 108) is the second intein of the Thermococcus sp. PolB
(InBase: Tsp-GE8 Pol-2) with 24% amino acid sequence
identity. The Mimivirus sequence exhibits all the expected
features required for an active intein (Fig. 2). Sequence
motifs [14] characterizing the splicing domain (N1-4, C2,
C1) and the dodecapeptide LAGLIDADG homing-endonuclease domain (EN1-4) were all identified in the Mimivirus sequence except N4 motif. N4 motif is occasionally
absent in the previously characterized active inteins [14].
Amino acid residues providing nucleophilic groups in
self-splicing reactions are all present: the first serine and
the last asparagine residues of the intein, and the first threonine residue of the downstream extein. Accordingly the
Mimivirus intein is a canonical "asparagine-type" intein,
of which the close homologues have previously been
observed only in archaea species. In contrast, the previously reported Chilo iridescent virus intein is a noncanonical "glutamine-type" exhibiting a glutamine residue at the C-terminus [3,15]. The threonine and histidine
residues in the N3 motif assisting in the initial acyl rearrangement at the N-terminal splice junction are also conserved. Thus, we predict that the Mimivirus intein is an
active intein capable of self-splicing. The presence of a
homing endonuclease domain suggests that this intein
also retained its capacity to spread to other sites of the
genome or to other organisms.

Other three inserts that we identified in the Mimivirus
PolB are rather short. Those inserts are unique to Mimivirus, being not found in other PolB sequences. One of the
extra segments of 197 aa found at the position 'i3' (Fig.
1A) exhibits a marginal sequence similarity to an intein
within the replication factor C of Methanococcus jannaschii
(E-value = 0.002, Fig. S2). However, it also exhibits a comparable level of sequence similarities to several unrelated
database sequences, apparently containing low complexity sequences. The i3-insert lacks sequence features
required for an active intein. The remaining two extra segments (88 and 121 aa at the position 'i1' and 'i2', respectively) did not exhibit any significant similarity to known
protein sequences. The biological properties of those
three Mimivirus specific inserts remain to be
characterized.
Mimivirus intein belongs to a specific allele type
Inteins have been identified in different types of DNA
polymerases [16]. DNA polymerase catalytic subunits

The Mimivirus DNA polymerase PolB intein
The Mimivirus DNA polymerase PolB intein. The 351 amino acid residues intein sequence is shown with, respectively, the last
and the first three amino acid residues of the N-extein and the C-extein. Bold letters represent amino acid residues essential
for protein splicing. Conserved intein sequence motifs are indicated by underlines (N1, N2, N3, EN1, EN2, EN3, EN4, C2 and
C1). The sequence part matching to the Pfam LAGLIDADG endonuclease domain (PF00961, E-value = 0.16) is indicated by
italic letters. The intein/extein boundaries are shown by '|'.

known to contain inteins are archaeal PolI, archaeal DNA
polymerase II (PolII), bacterial DNA polymerase III α subunit (DnaE) and bacteriophage DNA polymerase I.
Among these, archaeal PolI belongs to the family B DNA
polymerase. Archaeal PolI contains up to three intein alleles, the insertion of which always occurs at one of three
strictly conserved positions (I, II and III in Fig. 1A). Interestingly, the location of the bipartite inteins that separate
the two PolI gene pieces of Nanoarchaeum equitans [17]
coincides with position III. Remarkably, Mimivirus intein
is exactly located at the position III (Fig. 1A). The
sequence around the insertion site is highly conserved
among different PolBs from evolutionary distant organisms such as Escherichia coli and human (Fig. 3). The crystal structure of Pyrococcus kodakaraensis PolI [11] reveals
that those three distinct sites are in close spatial proximity,
in the middle of the DNA binding domain and active site.
Perler et al. observed that inteins present in the same location within homologous genes ("intein alleles") tend to
be more similar with each other than with inteins in different locations of the same gene or in different genes
[18]. This phenomenon appears not only the simple consequence of regular vertical transmission of inteins, but
also the result of lateral acquisitions through "homing"
[19] at the same site of highly similar genes (i.e. "alleles")
by the mechanism involving gene conversion [18].
Remarkably, the Mimivirus PolB intein holds this rule.
The Mimivirus intein exhibits higher sequence homology
scores to inteins at the position III of archaeal PolI (designated as "pol-c allele") than to inteins in the other PolI
locations (I, II) or inteins in other genes. A phylogenetic

analysis of the Mimivirus intein and other PolI inteins
also supports the classification of the Mimivirus intein in
this specific "intein allele"-type (Fig. 1C). This underlines
the presence of intein subclasses ("intein alleles") each
exhibiting its own preference of harboring site, even in
such distantly related homologous genes such as Mimivirus PolB and archaeal PolI. It is implausible that the intein
homing mechanism involving gene conversion have led
to the direct transfer of an intein between such distantly
related homologous genes. Nucleotide sequences (18 bp)
around the pol-c allele insertion site do not exhibit unexpectedly high level of sequence similarities between Mimivirus (TATGGAGAC/ACGGACTCA for the amino acid
sequence YGD/TDS) and archaeal sequences. For
instance, the sequences from M. jannaschii and Pyrococcus
horikoshii exhibit 7-missmaches (TATATTGAC/ACTGATGGA; MJ0885) and 5 mismatches (TATATAGAC/ACGGATGGA; PH1947), respectively. To the best of our
knowledge, no evidence has been reported for a homing
endonuclease recognizing such different sequences,
although homing endonucleases are known to be rather
tolerant of single-base-pair changes in their lengthy DNA
recognition sequences [19]. A similar observation has
been reported for DnaB inteins of Rhodothermus marinus
and Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 [20].
A shift in the base compositions between intein and
extein coding sequences is considered as indicating a
recent acquisition of inteins [20]. Mimivirus PolB extein/
intein DNA sequence compositions do not show a significant difference. Both exhibit similar G+C-contents (29%)
and codon usages. In contrast, Thermococcus fumicolans

Sequence alignment of Family B DNA polymerases from the Archaea, Bacteria and Eukarya domains
Figure 3
Sequence alignment of Family B DNA polymerases from the Archaea, Bacteria and Eukarya domains. The Mimivirus PolB
sequence was used without its intein sequence. Only the region of the alignment around Mimivirus intein insertion site
("YGD|TDS") is shown. The insertion site precisely coincides with the most conserved positions in the sequences, as indicated
by bold letters. This is the sole region in the entire sequence exhibiting 6 consecutive identical residues among PolB of the
Archaea, Bacteria and Eukarya domains. SWISS-PROT/TrEMBL IDs are DPOL_ARCFU (Archaeoglobus fulgidus), Q8TWJ5
(Methanopyrus kandleri), DPO2_ECOLI (Escherichia coli), Q87NC2 (Vibrio parahaemolyticus), Q8SQP5 (Encephalitozoon cuniculi),
and DPOD_HUMAN (Human).

PolI coding DNA (GenBank: Z69882) exhibits a G+Ccontent of 57% for the extein regions, compared to G+Ccontents of 47% and 49% for its two inteins.

Discussion
Archaeal PolI inteins have been described only in extremophiles, growing under conditions of temperature over
80°C (hyperthermophiles) or of high salinity (10 times
that of sea water; halophiles). Mimivirus is mesophilic,

growing in amoeba under the temprature of 37°C. The
association of an archaeal-seqeunce-like intein with a
eukaryotic-like PolB in Mimivirus thus suggests an indirect interaction between mesophilic eukaryotic viruses
and extremophilic archaeabacteria. Mesophilic euryarchaea species similar to the methanogens associated with
rumen [21,22] or related species found in human beings
[23] might have mediated the transition of inteins
between extreme environment and moderate one in the

Virology Journal 2005, 2:8

course of evolution. However, no data are available yet on
the presence of inteins in the PolB genes of such mesophilic archaebacteria.
Lateral transfer (homing) might be responsible for the
phylogenetic incongruence between inteins and exteins,
and the same intein locations within homologues of distantly related organisms such as Mimivirus and archaea.
However, given the specificity of homing endonucleases
to long recognition sequences (12–40 bp) and the low
level DNA sequence similarity between viral and archeal
PolB homologues, a single recent homing event appears
quite unlikely. The spread of inteins is better explained by
a series of transfers, where inteins progressively accommodated small changes in their homing recognition
sequences while retaining their gene position specificity.
Such a cascade of transfers could have been mediated by
DNA viruses [3]. Consistent results now start to accumulate including recent identification of several inteins in
different iridoviruses (S. Pietrokovski pers. comm.), and
an intein in a golden brown alga-infecting virus HaV of
the Phycodnaviridae [24]. Given the similar base compositions of Mimivirus intein and extein, the low level of
intein homology between Mimivirus and archaea, and the
likely early origin of the Mimivirus/NCLDV lineage [2], it
is tempting to speculate that these DNA viruses might
have acquired inteins very early on, and acted as their central reservoir disseminating inteins across different
domains of life in the long course of evolution.

inspection of a multiple intein sequence alignment.
Neighbor joining tree analyses were conducted with the
use of MEGA version 2.1 [29]. All the gap containing columns in multiple sequence alignments were removed
before phylogenetic tree analyses. The gamma distance
was applied to compute evolutionary distances. The
gamma shape parameter (alpha) was estimated using the
GZ-GAMMA program [30].
The sequence and annotation data for the Mimivirus PolB
and intein was deposited to GenBank (accession number:
AY606804). The complete genome sequence of Mimivirus
is also available at GenBank (accession number:
NC_006450). For a comprehensive description of the
Mimivirus complete genome sequence and preliminary
characterizations of the viral particle, see [2].

Conclusions
We have characterized a new viral intein found in the
eukaryotic-type putative DNA polymerase PolB of Mimivirus by binformatics methods. The conservation of the
active site motifs for splicing as well as its insertion at a
catalytically important site of the PolB sequence suggests
that the intein is most likely to be functional. Our phylogenetic analyses revealed that the intein sequence is closest to extremophilic archaeal inteins. The intriguing
association of an extremophilic archaeal-type intein with
a mesophilic eukaryotic-like PolB in Mimivirus is consistent with the hypothesis that DNA viruses might have been
the central reservoir of inteins throughout the course of
evolution.

Methods
Sequence homology searches were carried out with the
use of the BLAST programs [25] against the SWISS-PROT/
TrEMBL database [26] and the New England Biolabs
Intein Database [InBase, http://www.neb.com/neb/
inteins.html; [Perler, 2002 #1380]]. Pfam [27] searches
were carried out with the use of its web site http://
www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam/. Multiple sequence
alignments were generated with the use of T-Coffee [28].
Intein sequence motifs were identified through the
