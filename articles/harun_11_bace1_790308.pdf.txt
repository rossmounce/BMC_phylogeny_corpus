Abstract
Background: BACE1 was found to be the major b-secretase in neurons and its appearance and activity were
found to be elevated in the brains of AD patients. Fungal endophytic extracts for BACE1 inhibitory activity and
cytotoxicity against PC-12 (a rat pheochromocytoma with neuronal properties) and WRL68 (a non-tumorigenic
human hepatic) were investigated.
Methods: Endophytes were isolated from plants collected from Kuala Pilah, Negeri Sembilan and the National Park,
Pahang and the extracts were tested for BACE1 inhibition. For investigation of biological activity, the pure
endophytic cultures were cultivated for 14 days on PDA plates at 28°C and underwent semipolar extraction with
ethyl acetate.
Results: Of 212 endophytic extracts (1000 μg/ml), 29 exhibited more than 90% inhibition of BACE1 in the
preliminary screening. Four extracts from isolates HAB16R13, HAB16R14, HAB16R18 and HAB8R24 identified as
Cytospora rhizophorae were the most active with IC50(BACE1) values of less than 3.0 μg/ml. The most active extract
HAB16R13 was shown to non-competitively inhibit BACE1 with Ki value of 10.0 μg/ml. HAB16R13 was considered
non-potent against PC-12 and WRL68 (IC50(CT) of 60.0 and 40.0 μg/ml, respectively).
Conclusions: This first report on endophytic fungal extract with good BACE1 inhibitory activity demonstrates that
more extensive study is required to uncover the potential of endophytes.

Background
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of
dementia in elderly people, and the fourth most common cause of death in developed countries [1]. It is estimated that about 18 million people worldwide are
currently affected by this disease and this figure is projected to double by 2025 with an ageing population [2].
Patients diagnosed with AD suffer memory loss, language deterioration, poor judgment and impaired
visuospatial capability [3]. At present, there is no cure
for AD. Medication for AD only helps slow down progression of the disease so as to improve patients’ quality
of life. Histopathologically, AD is characterized by the
formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) from phosphorylated tau protein in the neurons and the

deposition of b-amyloid (Ab) plaque in the parenchyma
of the amygdale, hippocampus and neocortex of the
brain [4]. The major component of amyloid plaque is
the b-amyloid protein (Ab), a 39-43 amino acid peptide
composed of a portion of the transmembrane domain
and the extracellular domain of the amyloid precursor
protein (APP) [5]. Ab is produced by a sequential cleavage of APP at the amino terminal end by b-secretase
followed by g-secretase at the carboxyl terminal end [6].
b-secretase has been identified as an aspartic protease,
b-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1
(BACE1), also called Asp 2 (for novel aspartic protease
2) and memapsin 2 (for membrane aspartic protease/
pepsin 2). It is currently the most attractive target for
the inhibition of amyloid production since it is the key
enzyme that initiates the formation of Ab [7]. Furthermore, BACE1 was found to be the major b-secretase in
neurons [8] and its expression and activity were found
to be elevated in the brains of AD patients.

b-secretase inhibitors have potential to be developed as
anti-dementia drugs. Nevertheless, all drugs considered
for AD must be able to cross the plasma membrane, and
most importantly the blood-brain-barrier [9]. Enzyme
inhibitors with therapeutic potential should preferably be
smaller than 700 Da, making large peptide-based inhibitors not viable as drug candidates [10]. Thus, the secondary metabolites of plants and microbes, which have
relatively low-molecular weights and high lipophilicity,
may offer possibilities for drugs against AD [10].
Plants serve as a reservoir of microorganisms known as
endophytes [11]. These endophytes, mostly fungi and
bacteria, live in the intercellular spaces of plant tissues.
Endophytes have high diversity and are relatively fast
growing on routinely used laboratory media. Many of the
endophytes species are able to produce large amount of
novel compounds and is predicted to be a major source
for new and useful metabolites [12]. To the best of our
knowledge, their ability to produce compounds that inhibit b-secretase have not been previously reported.

baculovirus-expressed BACE-1 and a specific substrate
(Rh-EVNLDAEFK-quencher) based on the Swedish
mutation of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). This
peptidic substrate becomes highly fluorescent upon
enzymatic cleavage. A mixture of 10 μl of BACE1 substrate (Rh-EVNLDAEFK quencher, in 50 nmol/l ammonium bicarbonate), 10 μl of test compound, and 10 μl of
BACE1 (b-secretase) enzyme [(50 mM Tris (pH7.5),
10% glycerol) (1.0 U/ml)] were incubated for 60 min at
room temperature and protected from light. Then 10 μl
of BACE1 stop buffer (2.5 mol/l sodium acetate) was
added to the mixture. Fluorescence was read using a
multiwell spectrofluorometer (infiniteM200, TECAN)
under excitation at 545 nm and the emitted light at 585
nm. Percentage inhibition of the enzyme was then calculated. In the preliminary screening all 212 endophytic
extracts were tested for BACE1 inhibition using a single
concentration of 1000 μg/ml. Active extracts showing
>90% BACE1 inhibition in preliminary screening were
then reexamined at a concentration ranging from 0.1
μg/ml to 1000 μg/ml to determine the IC 50(BACE1)
values. The IC50 (BACE1) value is defined as the concentration of BACE1 inhibitor that is required to inhibit
50% of BACE1 activity.

Methods
Fungi

Fungal endophytes were obtained from the culture collection of the Collaborative Drug Discovery Research
(CDDR) Group, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM), Malaysia. They were previously isolated from medicinal plants from rainforest parks in
Malaysia (Kuala Pilah, Negeri Sembilan [13], and the
National Park, Pahang [14]). Axenic cultures were maintained on potato dextrose agar (PDA, Oxoid) plates.
Extracts of cultures grown for 14 days at 28°C on PDA
plates were assessed for bioactivity. A total of 212
strains were grown for investigation.
Semipolar extraction of fungal cultures

Semipolar extraction was as described previously by
Ramasamy et al. [13]. Briefly, after 14 days of incubation, 10 plates of each isolate were transferred into a
conical flask (500 ml) and homogenized using a homogenizer (Kika Labortechnik, T25). Ethyl acetate (200 ml)
was added and left to stir overnight at room temperature. The mixture was filtered through Whatman No.1
filter paper, after which sodium sulphate was added to
remove the aqueous layer within the mixture. The mixture was then transferred to a round bottom flask (500
ml) and dried using a rotary evaporator (Buchi, R-215).
The resultant extract was dissolved in 1 ml dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (Sigma) and stored at -20°C until use.
BACE1 inhibitory activity

Crude endophytic extracts (1000 μg/ml) were assayed
for BACE1 inhibition using a fluorescence resonance
energy transfer (FRET) assay (Pan Vera Co.), that uses

Determination of the inhibition pattern on BACE1

To investigate the BACE1 inhibition pattern, the most
active endophytic extract (HAB16R13) was added to
each reaction mixture. The BACE1 inhibitory activity
was measured at different concentrations of substrate.
The inhibition constant (Ki) of b-secretase inhibitor was
then calculated using Dixon plots. The reaction velocity
is measured at a fixed concentration of substrate but
with different extract concentrations (from 0.1 μg/ml to
1000 μg/ml). The 1/V0 (RFU/min) against inhibitor concentration was plotted and the kinetics of BACE1 in the
presence of the inhibitor determined.
Cytotoxicity

PC-12 (ATCC CRL-1721), a rat pheochromocytoma was
maintained in DMEM high glucose (PAA Laboratories)
supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% heat-deactivated foetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. PC-12 has neuronal properties and expression
of BACE1 is readily detectable in neuronal cells [15-17].
WRL68 (ATCC CL-48), a non-tumorigenic fetal hepatic
cell was maintained in RPMI 1640 (Sigma) supplemented with 10% heat-deactivated foetal bovine serum (FBS)
(PAA Laboratories) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin
(PAA Laboratories). Cells of about 80-85% confluence
were harvested and plated onto 96-flat bottom well
plates for experimental use. The culture was maintained
in a humidified incubator at 37°C in an atmosphere of
5% CO2.

The extract showing the greatest BACE1 inhibitory
activity HAB16R13 was then tested (at various concentrations from 0.1 μg/ml - 1000 μg/ml) for cytotoxicity
against PC-12 and WRL68 using the MTT assay [18].
Plates were read using an Elisa plate reader (Perkin
Elmer) at 520 nm. Data generated was used to plot a
dose-response curve of which the concentration of
extract required to kill 50% of the cell population (IC50
(CT)) was determined.

option). Tree stability was evaluated by 1000 parsimony
bootstrap replicates [21]. Branches corresponding to
partitions reproduced in less than 50% bootstrap replicates were collapsed. A phylogenetic tree was constructed from distance matrix values by the neighbourjoining (NJ) method using the p-distance parameter
model to estimate evolutionary distance. A bootstrap
analysis was performed using 1000 resamples of the
data. Phomopsis theae isolate NW284w was used as an
outgroup.

DNA extraction, PCR amplication and sequencing

The active isolates (HAB16R13, HAB16R14, HAB16R18
and HAB8R24) were identified. using molecular methods. Fungal DNA extraction was carried out using MasterPure Yeast DNA Purification Kit (Epicentre, USA).
18S ribosome DNA sequence was isolated by PCR using
Internal

primer
(TCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCGG) and ITS-4 (5’TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3’). The amplification
was performed in a total reaction volume of 100 μl containing 50 μl of GoTaq Green Master Mix (Promega,
USA), 4 μl of each of the primer, 6 μl of DNA template
and 36 μl of nuclease free water using Applied Biosystems GeneAmp PCR System 9600 (Biorad, USA). PCR
condition consisted of an initial denaturing step of 1
min at 94°C followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 30 s,
annealing at 50°C for 1 min and 72°C for 30 s. The
reaction was completed with final extension at 72°C for
7 min and at 25°C for 30 s. The amplified PCR product
was separated by electrophoresis in 1.5% (w/v) agarose
gel at 90 V for 40 min in 1× Tris-acetate-EDTA (TAE)
buffer, stained with ethidium bromide and visualized
under UV light and photographed. A 100-bp size marker (Promega, USA) was used as reference. The amplified PCR product was purified using Wizard® SV Gel
and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega, USA) and subsequently sent for sequencing. The analysis and comparison of the sequences were performed with nucleotide
blast of GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The
sequences were deposited in GenBank.
Phylogenetic analysis

The ITS sequences were aligned to each other as well as
the sequences retrieved from the NCBI databases, using
multiple sequence alignment software CLUSTAL W
program with default settings [19]. Phylogenetic analyses
were performed by the neighbour-joining (NJ) method
using Molecular Evolutionary Genetic Analysis 4
(MEGA4) software [20]. Parsimony trees were obtained
using the Close-Neighbor-Interchange algorithm with
search level 3, in which the initial trees were obtained
with ten random addition replicates of the sequences
[21,22]. All positions containing gaps and missing data
were eliminated from the dataset (complete deletion

Statistical analysis

Differences between the extracts were evaluated using
the one-way ANOVA procedure in SPSS version 16.0.
When there was a difference, the LSD (least significant
different) post hoc test was used to identify pairs that
differed significantly. Significance was P < 0.05 unless
otherwise stated.

Results
BACE1 inhibitory activity

BACE1 inhibitory activity of 212 endophytic extracts
(1000 μg/ml) in preliminary screening found 13.7% (29)
to be very active with > 90% inhibition of BACE1 activity. A further 13.7% (29) of the extracts also showed
very good activity (80-89.9% inhibition). 14.2% (30) and
32.5% (69) of the extracts displayed 70-79.9% and 5069.9% inhibition, respectively. The remaining 25.9% (55)
exhibited <50% inhibition of BACE1 activity. IC 50
(BACE1) values of 29 of the most active strains are shown
in Table 1. Four extracts, HAB16R13, HAB16R18,
HAB16R14 and HAB8R24 exhibited IC50 (BACE1) values
of less than 3.0 μg/ml. HAB16R13 (IC50 (BACE1) = 2.15
μg/ml), showed the best BACE1 inhibitory activity.
Determination of the inhibition pattern on BACE1

The inhibition pattern displayed by the most active
HAB16R13 endophytic extract was then studied. Plots
of the initial velocity versus endophytic extract concentrations in the presence of different substrate concentrations gave a family of straight lines. The inhibition
pattern of extract HAB16R13 (Ki = 10 μg/ml) against
BACE1 from the Dixon plot (Figure 1) was found to be
non-competitive with the substrate at the active site of
BACE1. It may bind to either another regulatory site or
to the subsite of b-secretase.
Cytotoxicity

Extract HAB16R13 when tested against PC-12 and
WRL68 showed IC50 (CT) values of 60.0 and 40.0 μg/ml
respectively (Figure 2), which are considered to be nonpotent. The criterion established by the US NCI is that
crude extract with IC50 (CT) value of less than 20 μg/ml
is considered to have in vitro cytotoxicity [23].

Molecular identification and phylogenetic analysis

The ITS of HAB16R13, HAB16R14. HAB16R18 and
HAB8R24 were found to be 586-593 bp in length. A
BLAST search of the ITS of all four isolates revealed
that they were nearly identical to Cytospora rhizophorae (98-99% similarity). A further phylogenetic analysis based on ITS sequences was conducted to
compare the sequences with those in GenBank to
determine their relationship and authenticate the identification. There was a total of 481 positions in the
final dataset, out of which 37 were parsimony informative (Figure 3). Similar results were obtained using
neighbour-joining analyses (results not shown). Most
of the clades were supported by bootstraps values (3496% bootstrap support). All four isolates were found to
be in the same clade with Cytospora rhizophorae strain
MUCC302 and Cytospora eucalyptina. Cytospora rhizophorae is from the class Ascomycetes, order Diaporthales and family Valsaceae.

Discussion
Endophytic fungi, HAB16R13, HAB16R14 and
HAB16R18 were isolated from the roots of Cinnamomum porrectum while HAB8R24 from Polyalthia glauca.
Oil from the root of C. porrectum has been documented
to exhibit antimicrobial activity [24] and Polyalthia sp.
used as an aphrodisiac, anti-parasite, anti-rheumatic and
as an anti-inflammatory agent [25]. Although the compounds responsible for the BACE1 inhibitory activity
were not identified in the present study, Cytospora sp.
has been reported to produce cytosporacin [26], grahamimycin A [27], cytoskyrin A [28] and cytosporone E
[29]. These compounds have been reported to exhibit
antimicrobial activity [27-30]. Interestingly, cytosporic
acid was found to inhibit a critical enzyme involved in
the replication of HIV with an IC50 of 20 μM [28]. The
pure compound cytoskyrin A, displayed poor cytotoxicity against some tumor cell lines (IC 50 > 5 μg/ml) in
vitro [29]. Grahamimycin A also did not induce any
toxic symptoms in adult mice [27].
Many groups have focused on high-throughput
screening of chemical libraries for BACE1 inhibitors

but discovery of naturally occurring BACE1 inhibitors
have been limited. Thus far only one BACE1 inhibitor
drug candidate (CTS-21166) has completed the Phase
1 clinical trial [31]. Several hydroxyl-containing compounds (hydroxyethylene and hydroxyethylamine) have
been reported as BACE1 inhibitors [32,33]. Chitosan
derivatives from crab shell and latifolin from Dalbergia
sissoo have shown weak BACE1 inhibition [34,35].
Catechins from green tea [13], ellagic acid and punicalagin from pomegranate [36], hispidin from mycelial
cultures of Phellinus linteus [37] and several compounds isolated from Sanguisorbae radix [38] have all
been studied as BACE1 inhibitors. In order to have
therapeutic potential, however efficacious penetration
of the blood-brain barrier requires the molecular
weights of inhibitors to be under 700 Da making large
peptide-based inhibitors unsuitable as drug candidates.
Thus, plants and microbial metabolites that have relatively low molecular weights and lipophilicity may be
suitable as drug candidates for BACE1 inhibition [39].
Based on the prevailing view on the fundamental role
of Ab in the pathogenesis of AD, there seems to be
good reason to expect that b-secretase inhibitor drugs
may alter the course of the disease [31]. This first report
of a fungal endophyte producing a BACE1 inhibitor
would indicate they warrant further investigation.

Conclusion
In conclusion, this preliminary screening of fungal endophytic extracts revealed their potential as a source of
BACE1 inhibitors which could have a role in the

development of drugs for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.
