Abstract
Background: Comparative approaches using protostome and deuterostome data have greatly
contributed to understanding gene function and organismal complexity. The family 2 G-protein
coupled receptors (GPCRs) are one of the largest and best studied hormone and neuropeptide
receptor families. They are suggested to have arisen from a single ancestral gene via duplication
events. Despite the recent identification of receptor members in protostome and early
deuterostome genomes, relatively little is known about their function or origin during metazoan
divergence. In this study a comprehensive description of family 2 GPCR evolution is given based on
in silico and expression analyses of the invertebrate receptor genes.
Results: Family 2 GPCR members were identified in the invertebrate genomes of the nematodes
C. elegans and C. briggsae, the arthropods D. melanogaster and A. gambiae (mosquito) and in the
tunicate C. intestinalis. This suggests that they are of ancient origin and have evolved through gene/
genome duplication events. Sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analyses have demonstrated
that the immediate gene environment, with regard to gene content, is conserved between the
protostome and deuterostome receptor genomic regions. Also that the protostome genes are
more like the deuterostome Corticotrophin Releasing Factor (CRF) and Calcitonin/Calcitonin
Gene-Related Peptide (CAL/CGRP) receptors members than the other family 2 GPCR members.
The evolution of family 2 GPCRs in deuterostomes is characterised by acquisition of new family
members, with SCT (Secretin) receptors only present in tetrapods. Gene structure is characterised
by an increase in intron number with organismal complexity with the exception of the vertebrate
CAL/CGRP receptors.
Conclusion: The family 2 GPCR members provide a good example of gene duplication events
occurring in tandem with increasing organismal complexity during metazoan evolution. The
putative ancestral receptors are proposed to be more like the deuterostome CAL/CGRP and CRF
receptors and this may be associated with their fundamental role in calcium regulation and the
stress response, both of which are essential for survival.

Background
The Guanine protein coupled receptor (GPCRs) family is
one of the largest receptor groups in vertebrates. Members
of this family are also present in unicellular eukaryotes
such as yeast and in plants which suggests that they are of
ancient origin [1]. In the human genome, GPCRs account
for approximately 2% of the coding genes [2,3] and they
bind structurally diverse ligands such as protons, odorants, biogenic amines, peptides and glycoproteins [4,5].
Recent analysis of the human genome identified five main
GPCR subfamilies collectively known as GRAFS (Glutamate, G; Rhodopsin, R; Adhesion, A; Frizzled, F; and
Secretin, S) [1,6]. This grouping was based on protein
motifs characterised by the presence of seven highly conserved transmembrane domains (TM). Several authors
have proposed the existence of a common ancestral gene
in early metazoans that, as a consequence of successive
duplication events, generated the full complement of family members in vertebrates [6,7]. Such a proposal is in general agreement with the genome duplication theories of
Haldane 1932 [8], Muller 1935 [9] and Ohno 1970 [10].
All of which suggest that the existence of gene family
members in chordates is a consequence of genome duplication events in the vertebrate lineage during evolution
and that gene duplicates are an essential source of organism diversity.
The present work focuses on the secretin family (a.k.a
family B or 2) of GPCRs which represent one of the largest
receptor families for hormones and neuropeptides
involved in several important biological functions. Previous in silico analysis identified a total of 50 family 2 GPCR
members in the human genome [6,11,12]. However only
receptor members of the following groups: a) Corticotrophin Releasing Factor (CRF); b) Secretin (SCT), Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP), Pituitary Adenylate CyclaseActivating Polypeptide (PACAP) and Growth Hormone
Releasing Hormone (GHRH); c) Glucagon (GCG), Glucagon-Like Peptide (GLP), Glucose Insulinotropic Peptide
(GIP); d) Parathyroid Hormone (PTR) and e) Calcitonin
(CAL) and Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP)
[13,14] have been functionally characterised and identified in other vertebrates such as birds, amphibians and teleosts [15-18]. So far, in invertebrates putative family 2
GPCRs have been found based upon sequence similarity
and phylogenetic studies ([1,14,17,19,20], but their evolution and function is poorly described.
In this study, comparative analyses using phylogenetically
distant organisms have been used to study the evolution
of members of the family 2 GPCRs in metazoans (Figure
1). Gene family members were characterised in protostome (nematode and arthropod) and tunicate (Ciona)
genomes and compared with their vertebrate homologues
(Takifugu and human). Putative family 2 GPCR receptor

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/108

members were identified and isolated in silico from public
genome databases and their expression analysed by RTPCR. The gene structures and gene environments vis à vis
gene content of the protostome and deuterostome receptors were compared and a model for the evolution of family 2 GPCR receptors is proposed.

Results
Putative family 2 GPCRs in invertebrates
Initially, three, five and nine putative family 2 GPCR
genes were identified respectively in the protostome
genomes of the nematodes (C. elegans and C briggsae), the
arthropods (D. melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae) and
in the deuterostome genome of the tunicate C. intestinalis.
With the exception of the C.briggsae and mosquito receptor genes, the protostome and tunicate predicted gene
sequences were edited taking into consideration EST data
available in order to minimise errors derived from in silico
gene predictions (Additional file 1). Sequence comparison and other in silico approaches revealed that of these
genes, only two in the nematodes, three in the fruit-fly,
one gene in the mosquito and eight in the Ciona genome
contained seven TM domains and were considered to be
putative family 2 GPCRs members (Figure 2, Table 1).
Database searches carried out in the prokaryote E. coli and
the unicellular eukaryote S. cerevisae genomes did not produce any significant alignments for family 2 receptor
genes.
Phylogenetic analysis
Because of gaps and errors in draft genome data, only 4
TMs were used in the full analysis: TM2, TM4, TM5 and
TM6 which were found to be common to all metazoan
genes analysed (Additional file 2). The amino acid
sequences of the TM domains of a total of 52 receptors
were concatenated and aligned using the ClustalX programme (Blosum matrix and Gap opening penalty 10 and
Gap extension 0.2). The alignment produced (length 98,
with 99 informative sites) did not required the insertion
of gaps and was used for phylogenetic analysis and the
consensus tree obtained is presented on Figure 2. Family
2 GPCR members are suggested to have evolved via both
late and early gene duplication events, which have
occurred during metazoan evolution. Examples of specific
gene duplication events which are well supported by the
high bootstrap values of the tree nodes are the Ciona gene
pair CinS5A/CinS5B, CinS372/CinS752 and the gene pair
CinS50/CinS273. After neighbour joining, maximum parsimony and minimum evolution phylogenetic analysis,
the protostome receptors and Ciona CinS93, CinS50 and
CinS273 genes tended to cluster with the deuterostome
CRF and CAL/CGRP receptor family members. In Ciona
orthologues of the majority of the vertebrate family members such as CinS752 and CinS352 group with the PTR
receptor subfamily, whilst CinS5A, CinS5B and CinS70

genes seem to be more related in sequence to the GCG/
GLP/GIP and PAC/VPAC/GHRH families however
CinS5A and CinS5B position in the tree was not clearly
defined.
Sequence comparative analyses
Comparison of the amino acid sequences of the putative
protostome and tunicate receptors with the vertebrate
homologues revealed the existence of conserved amino
acid motifs at the ligand-binding N-terminal region (Figure 3). Large N-terminal regions containing five conserved

cysteines were identified in all species analysed with the
exception of the Ciona CinS273 and CinS70 genes which
due to incomplete genome coverage and EST data available lacked complete N-terminal regions and CinS50
where the putative initial methionine was not identified.
Other highly conserved amino acid residues such as the
amino acid aspartate (D) before the motif C-W-P and the
amino acid motifs C-W-P, C-P and G-X-W (where X is any
amino acid) (crucial for ligand binding in mammals)
[21,22] were also identified. Moreover, the amino acid
glycine (G) localised between this latter motif and the C-

have 7 TM domains; (#) TM4 was not identified; (+) incomplete

P motif was also found to be conserved amongst metazoans however no functional role for this residue has been
yet assigned.
To strengthen previous analysis and in order to identify
novel amino acid and protein motifs that have been conserved within each receptor subfamily, members that
might have a potential role in ligand binding in the protostome and deuterostome N-terminal regions of the
receptors were compared based on receptor clustering
groups previously obtained by phylogentic analysis. Putative protostome and tunicate members of the CAL/CGRP,
CRF, PTH and CGC/GLP/GIP receptor families were
aligned with the vertebrate homologue receptor genes
(Additional files 3456). Examples of novel conserved Nterminal protein motifs identified are the W-S/T-N-Y/F
motif in CAL/CGRP receptors alignment (Additional file
3); the motif G-V/I-X-Y (X any amino acid) within CRF
receptor group (Additional file 4) which has been previously reported to be involved in ligand binding [23,24];
the motifs E-W, P-G; Y-I-Y/I-D-F-D/N-H and A-X-R (X any
amino acid) in the PTR group and amino acid HsaPTR1 R
186(Additional file 5) which was previously found to be
determinant for PTH binding [25] and the motif Y-L/I-P/
E-W within GCG/GLP/GIP receptor group (Additional file
6).
Short-range linkage mapping analysis
Short-range linkage analysis was carried out between the
protostome (C. elegans and D. melanogaster) with the deuterostome (Takifugu and human) homologous regions
which contain family 2 receptor genes. The linked genes
identified in both C. elegans and Takifugu were used to
identify homologous genes in the Drosophila (Figure 4)
and human (Figure 5) genomes. The protostome gene
environment was found to be conserved and linked genes
were identified between the nematode and insect
genomes. The Drosophila X chromosome and chromosome III of C. elegans showed the greatest number of
linked genes. Within the protostome genome three genes

namely 3H538, Clp-2 and him-4 in C. elegans were also
found to be conserved in the homologous deuterostomes
genome regions analysed (Figure 5). A number of Takifugu
scaffolds were found to share a similar gene environment
with C. elegans chromosomes II and X, and human chromosomes 2, 3, 6, 7, and 17. This suggests that the nematode chromosome regions may be very similar in terms of
gene content with the ancestral chromosomal region that
gave rise to this family of receptors in vertebrates (Figure
5).
Gene organisation in protostomes and deuterostomes
The gene organisation of the regions encompassing the
seven TM domains of the protostome and tunicate family
2 GPCR genes were characterised and compared with the
vertebrate human and Takifugu homologous regions (Figure 6). Different gene structures were observed between
protostomes and deuterostomes. This was mainly due to
an increase in intron number in the latter species. Comparison of exon/intron boundaries revealed total conservation of splice sites (AG/GT) although intron phases are
generally poorly conserved with the exception of the TM1
and TM2 boundary (Figure 6).

Amongst protostome family 2 GPCR genes, organisation
is poorly conserved. In nematodes two different gene
organisations were identified for the receptors
CelC13B9.4/CbrCAE70126 (5 exons) and CelC18B12.2/
CbrCAE63268 (6 exons), respectively. In the Drosophila
genome, a different gene organisation also exists for each
of the three receptor genes analysed. TM1 and TM2 in the
Drosophila genes DmeCG32843 and DmeCG8422, in
common with the nematode, tunicate and vertebrate
receptors, are encoded by individual exons. The
DmeCG13758 gene has the most divergent gene structure
amongst protostomes and is composed of 3 exons. In
mosquito,
the
gene
structure
of
AgENSANGP00000014164 (AgaP14164) is similar to
DmeCG8422 with which it share greatest sequence similarity.

numbers of the protostome family 2 receptor genes: House cricket (Acheta domesticus) Diuretic hormone receptor (AdoDHR,
Q16983), Drosophila melanogaster (DmeCG13758, NP_570007; DmeCG8422, NP_610960; DmeCG32843, XP_396046),
Anopheles gambiae (AgaP14164, EAA11768), Caenorhabditis. elegans (CelC18B12.2, NP_510496; CelC13B9.4, NP_498465) and
Caenorhabditis briggsae (CbrCAE70126, CAE70126; CbrCAE63268, CAE63268). EST data was used to obtain the N-terminal
region of the incomplete receptor sequences (Additional file 1). The N-terminal region of Ciona CinS752 was predicted by NIX
and that of CinS5A by sequence comparison with CinS5B. Only the clones for which a putative N-terminal domain was identified were included in the analysis. For figure simplicity, an arrow indicates the region of the receptor CbrCAE70126 that was
eliminated since it did not align with any other sequences present.

The dashed lines represent the common genes that were identified in both protostome and deuterostome genomes. For simplicity, only genes that are in common are represented.

In contrast with protostomes, two main gene structures
were characterised in deuterostomes with TM4, TM5 and
TM7 domains shared between two exons. In human and
Takifugu, the CAL and CGRP receptors genes form a separate group with a different gene organisation from the
other receptor genes. These receptors seem to have lost an
intron between the exons that contain part of TM5 and
TM6 and part of TM7 respectively and are composed of 7
exons with identical intron phases. The Ciona CinS5A,
CinS5B, CinS50 and CinS273 receptor genes are also
shorter and composed by 6 exons. With the exception of
the CAL and CGRP receptors all human and Takifugu family 2 genes and Ciona CinS70, CinS93, CinS372 and
CinS752 receptors are composed of 8 exons and share
identical intron phases.
Expression analysis
RT-PCR with specific primers for each receptor gene was
carried out using total RNA extracted from whole adult C.

elegans, Drosophila, mosquito and Ciona (results not
shown). The nematode receptor genes CelC18B12.2 and
CelC13B9.4,
the
Drosophila
DmeCG13758,
DmeCG32843 and DmeCG8422 were successfully amplified. The tissue distribution was refined in Ciona with
expression analyses carried out in the intestine, pharyngeal basket, gonads, endostyle and cerebral ganglion. The
putative family 2 GPCR encoded by CinS70, was
expressed in all tissues analysed, but was mainly present
in the intestine, gonads and cerebral ganglion. The
CinS5A gene expression had a similar tissue distribution
to CinS70. However its duplicate, CinS5B had a more limited distribution and was only expressed in the intestine.
The receptors CinS273 and CinS752 were only expressed
in gonad and cerebral ganglion tissue, whilst CinS93 was
expressed in the endostyle. CinS50 was restricted to the
ovary where it was weakly expressed. It was not possible
to amplify AgENSANGP00000014164 and CinS372
receptors.

Discussion
In total 16 putative family 2 GPCR members were identified and characterised in the protostome and in the tunicate genome using the human and Takifugu TM domain
sequences. In the human genome a total of 50 family 2
GPCR receptors have been described [6,11,12]) although
ligands have only been assigned for 15 family 2 GPCR
members [16,26]. The evolution of this latter receptor
group is the major subject of this study.
To avoid the inclusion of potential intronic regions which
could bias analysis, the invertebrate genes were manually
edited using expression data available and sequence simi-

larity for the homologue genes and the in silico analysis
performed was restricted for receptor conserved motifs at
N-terminal and TM domains. The putative invertebrate
receptors identified share the general characteristics of
family 2 GPCR members with the presence of conserved
cysteine residues [27,28] and several highly conserved
amino acids and protein motifs at the N-terminal domain
which is involved in ligand binding [22]. Analysis of unicellular organism genomes such as the prokaryote E. coli
and the eukaryote S. cerevisae failed to reveal any putative
family 2 receptor genes suggesting that these receptor
genes are characteristic of metazoan genomes.

Diagram illustrating the increase in gene number and gene structure complexity of the TM domains regions of family 2 GPCR receptor genes in protostomes (nematodes and arthropods) and deuterostomes (tunicate and vertebrate). The proposed species-specific gene duplications are indicated in the figure. Putative gene or
genome duplication events of ancestral family 2 GPCRs during metazoan evolution are indicated by arrows (dashed arrow –
represent several duplication events within the chordate lineage). The number of receptors identified in each species is within
brackets. Exons are represented by blocks and introns by lines and the molecular evolutionary time for each species is indicated in MYA (million years ago) and was obtained from Hedges and Kumar, 2003 [82] and (*) from Dehal et al. 2002 [42]. The
TM domain regions are represented by shaded regions and numbered. Intron/exon boundary phases are indicated below each
exon. The tunicate and vertebrates family 2 GPCR members have been grouped according to their common gene organisation.
The figure is not drawn to scale.

The protostome genes identified are more like the vertebrate CAL/CGRP and CRF receptors subfamilies suggesting that ancestral family 2 GPCR members were most like
these genes. In vertebrates these receptors are associated
with calcium homeostasis and the stress axis respectively,
and appropriate functioning is essential for survival [2932]. No studies are available describing the role of these
receptors in protostomes and their classification was
based upon their sequence similarity, so they may not be
functional orthologues. Recently, expression studies carried out using the Drosophila DmeCG8244 and
DmeCG32843 (equivalent to CG17415) receptor genes,

which are very similar in sequence to the vertebrate CRF
and CAL/CGRP receptors, respectively, were indeed found
to be functional orthologues. These studies revealed that
DmeCG8244 and DmCG32843 in the presence of insect
diuretic hormones (DH) were functional and activate a
similar intracellular signalling pathway to the vertebrate
receptor genes [33,34].
It is generally accepted that complexity of vertebrates and
the origin and development of physiological systems is a
consequence of the acquisition of new genes by gene or
exon duplications that occurred during chordate evolu-

tion ([10,35-38]. The absence of sequence homologues of
the other members of family 2 in protostomes may be a
consequence of the relatively low complexity of nematodes and arthropods when compared with vertebrates.
For example, it is known that VIP, PACAP, SCT, GCG,
GLPs and GIP peptides and their receptors are mainly
associated with the nervous and gastrointestinal systems.
In protostomes these biological structures are of very low
complexity [39] and an organised gastroenteropancreatic
system has only been identified after the divergence of
tunicates. In general, a similar evolutionary profile occurs
during the development of metazoan nervous systems
(with the exception of cephalopod molluscs, which also
have a highly developed nervous system). The occurrence
of an organised brain and complex central nervous structure is only present in vertebrates. In the majority of protostomes and early deuterostomes the nervous system is
mainly characterised by the presence of simple structures
such as cerebral and head ganglions to which several
nerve networks are connected and like the gastroenteropancreatic system it has been evolving by varying degrees
of complexity throughout metazoan evolution [39].
The existence of an increasing gene number of family 2
GPCR members in the metazoan lineage clearly suggests
that evolution of this gene family results from a series of
duplications. Several gene duplication events have been
proposed to have occurred in chordate genomes. However
if they are a consequence of two total genome duplication
events (2R theory, [10,40-42]) or a result of independent
single gene duplications ([43,44]) is still under debate.
The 2R theory has been generally accepted to justify the
presence of gene family members and novel genes in
higher vertebrate genomes when compared with early
chordate and invertebrate species. Family 2 GPCR members have been identified in the majority of vertebrate
genomes [17,20] and searches carried out on the amphibian and chicken genomes identified an equivalent
number of gene family members (data not shown) to that
found in the human genome. In particular putative SCT
receptor genes, lacking in teleost genomes, were identified
as previously described by Langerstrom et al [46]. The
absence of an equivalent SCT receptor sequence in teleosts
but its identification in amphibian and avian genomes
may indicate that this receptor either, i) arose after the
divergence of the fishes or, ii) was lost in the fish lineage
and studies on ancient fishes (eg. Agnatha) should help to
clarify this issue.
The protostome receptors contain the most divergent gene
structures when compared with those of deuterostomes
(intron number, TM domain distribution and intron
phases). This is probably a consequence of the higher rate
of chromosomal and gene rearrangements when compared to early chordates and vertebrates [47-50]. The rea-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/108

son behind differences in intron numbers between
protostomes and deuterostomes remains to be established. The precursor gene in Urbilateria (last common
ancestors of protostomes and deuterostomes) remains to
be identified and therefore the difference in intron numbers can be explained either by intron gain during metazoan evolution after the divergence of the protostome and
deuterostome [51-53] or by intron loss in the protostome
lineage [54,55]. Interestingly, the vertebrate CAL and
CGRP receptor gene organisation is more like the tunicate
receptors than other vertebrate family 2 members and the
way in which these receptors function is also different.
Accessory single transmembrane proteins (Receptor activity modifying proteins, RAMPs [56,57]) interact with both
CAL and CGRP receptors and alter their affinity profile for
the ligands (CAL, CGRP, adrenomodullin and amylin)
[58,59]. In fact CAL receptor-RAMP heterodimerazation is
essential for receptor function but not for the other family
2 members [58]. It remains to be established if such functional constraints can influence gene evolution and in
particular CAL/CGRP receptors gene evolution.
Expression analyses indicates that with the exception of
the single mosquito receptor and CinS372, all protostome
and tunicate genes are expressed. In general, the tissue distribution of the Ciona receptors mirrors the expression of
the vertebrate family 2 GPCRs sequence homologues. For
example, the duplicate CinS5A and CinS5B receptors and
CinS70 which share sequence similarity for the vertebrate
brain-gut peptide GCG, GLP, GIP receptors were found to
be expressed in Ciona intestine, gonads and neural ganglion suggesting that like the vertebrate homologues they
may also have a role in the gastrointestinal, reproductive
and nervous systems [60,61]. The function of the vertebrate receptors in the reproductive system is not clear, but
in the nervous and gastrointestinal systems they are
involved in carbohydrate, amino acid and lipid metabolism [60,62]. It remains to be established if the tunicate
receptors localised in these tissue have a similar functional role.
The Ciona CAL/CGRP (CinS93) homologue was only
expressed in the endostyle whilst the tunicate PTR-like
receptor homologue (CinS752) was present in the neural
ganglion and the gonads. In vertebrates these receptors are
found to have an important role in the endocrine regulation of calcium mediated by CAL and PTH hormones
[63]. The presence in Ciona of the vertebrate homologue
receptors may suggest that elements of calcium homeostasis are conserved between tunicates and vertebrates. Moreover, the expression of CinS93 in Ciona endostyle, the
homologue of the vertebrate thyroid gland, the site of CAL
production [64], further supports this hypothesis. The
CinS50 and CinS273 are the sequence homologues of the
vertebrate CRF receptors, which are mainly associated

with stress response [65]. In vertebrates both receptors are
found to be expressed in nervous tissue and CRF1 receptor
was also found in the gonads and CRF2 receptor in the
gastrointestinal tract [66,67]. The pattern of expression of
the tunicate CinS50 and CinS273 was similar and both
receptors were expressed in the gonads whilst CinS273
was further detected in the neural ganglion suggesting
they may also play a functional role in the nervous and
reproductive systems in tunicates. Functional and ligandbinding studies are required to characterise the physiological role of the tunicate receptors. Moreover, the isolation
and characterisation of their putative ligand peptides
which have yet to be comprehensively described will be
essential to understanding of their function.
The evolution of family 2 GPCR receptor genes in protostomes and deuterostomes is probably the result of a combination of species-specific gene duplications and gene or
genome duplication events in ancestral gene precursors
(Figure 6). For example, the Drosophila DmeCG8422 and
DmeCG32843 map to chromosome 2R and share a similar gene organisation. This suggests that they arose by a
specific gene duplication event. Based on their sequence
similarity, gene organisation and intron phases, the Drosophila DmeCG8422 and DmeCG32843 receptor genes
appear to be the orthologues of the nematode
CelC13B9.4 and Ciona CinS50/CinS273 and CinS93
receptors, respectively. In tunicates, 3 different family 2
GPCR ancestral gene precursors probably existed: the gene
precursor for CinS50/CinS273, the gene precursor for
CinS93 and a common gene precursor for CinS70/
CinS5A/CinS5B/CinS372/CinS752. These are proposed
to be the origin of the vertebrate CRF, CAL/CGRP genes
and remaining deuterostome family 2 GPCRs, respectively.

Conclusion
Putative family 2 receptor genes were isolated and characterised from a number of different invertebrate genomes.
This study provides for the first time a comprehensive
description of the gene sequence, structure and expression
of family 2 GPCRs members in invertebrates providing
important clues about their origin and evolution along

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/108

the metazoan divergence. The CAL/CGRP and CRF receptors are proposed to be the first family 2 members to
evolve in contrast to SCT receptors which seem to have
evolved much later and are only present in tetrapods.
Studies such as this, can via a mixture of in vitro and in silico approaches, contribute to a better understanding of
gene regulation in vertebrates.

Methods
Sequence database searches
Sequence database searches were carried out on the
genomes of the prokaryote Escherichia coli (E. coli), the
unicellular eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisae (S. cerevisae),
the nematodes Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) and
Caenorhabditis briggsae (C. briggsae), the insects, Drosophila
melanogaster (D. melanogaster) and mosquito Anopheles
gambiae (A. gambiae) and in the tunicate Ciona intestinalis
(C. intestinalis) (Table 2) using the TM domains of the 15
human [12] and the 21 Takifugu rubripes from Cardoso et
al., 2005[17] family 2 receptor genes. The TM domains of
the vertebrate family 2 GPCRs were concatenated and
used in conjunction with the BLASTP and TBLASTN algorithms [68] to interrogate invertebrate genomes. The
invertebrate in silico predicted sequences were identified
based on their sequence similarity for the vertebrate receptor genes using a cut-off E value higher than 10 and their
sequences were manually edited according to their similarity for the homologue genes in vertebrates and EST data
available (Additional file 1). The identity of the invertebrate genes was further confirmed against the GPCR database at CMBI [69] and in order to substantiate previous
searches (identify putative receptors that were not identified) they were further used to search all the genome databases used in this analysis (Table 2).
Gene organisation of invertebrate family 2 GPCRs
The gene organisation of the invertebrate family 2 members was manually characterised. This approach was complemented using the available protostome and Ciona EST
data to identify putative N and C terminal ends of the protein (Additional file 1). The presence of TM domain
regions was verified using the TMHMM Server v. 2.0 [70]
and their positions were subsequently confirmed by mul-

tiple sequence comparison alignments with the vertebrate
homologues based on PRINTS annotation [71]. The gene
structures of the human receptors were characterised
using the Spidey mRNA-to-genomic alignment programme [72] and the Takifugu receptor gene organisation
characterised as described in Cardoso et al, 2005[17].
Linkage analysis
The gene environments of the protostome (C. elegans and
Drosophila) and deuterostome (human and Takifugu)
receptor genes were compared using a sequence similarity
approach. The human, C. elegans and Drosophila gene
environments were accessed using the NCBI Mapview
interfaces [73]. The gene environment of the Takifugu scaffolds (release17/05) was accessed using NIX annotation
[74] and the neighbouring genes were used to search for
orthologues in human, C. elegans and Drosophila genomes
using the TBLASTX algorithm [75].
Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis
Sequence alignments of the predicted protostome and
deuterostome receptor protein sequences were carried out
using the Clustal X programme [76] (Blosum matrix, Gap
opening penalty 10, Gap extension 0.2) with and percentage similarity were calculated using GeneDoc [77]. The
evolutionary analysis between the protostome and deuterostome receptor genes was carried out using the TM
domains that were complete and common to all receptor
genes (TM2, TM4, TM5 and TM6) following a similar
strategy has previously described [17]. Manual editing of
the Takifugu family 2 GPCRs did not identify TM1 domain
of TruS012367, the TM5 of TruCRFR2 was found to be
incomplete and TM3 of TruS000381 was frameshifted.

The four TM domain sequences common to all metazoan
were concatenated and aligned using the ClustalX programme as described. The alignment produced (length
98, with 99 informative sites) was used for phylogenetic
analysis using the neighbour joining, maximum parsimony and minimum evolution methods with 1000 bootstrap replicates in the MEGA 3.1 phylogenetic programme
[78]. Multiple sequence alignments were also carried
using the manually edited protostome and deuterostome
receptors within each family 2 GPCR group using the
ClustalX programme (according to the parameters previously described) in order to further identify conserved
protein motifs or amino acid residues at the N-terminal
regions that might be involved in ligand-binding.

Aldrich, Spain) according to the manufactures instructions. 1–2 μg of total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis
and each reaction was performed as follows, 1xRT-PCR
buffer (Invitrogen), 0.25 mM dNTPs (Amersham-Biosciences, UK), 0.05 μg/μl random hexameric oligonucleotides, 1 U MMLV-RT (200 U/μl) (Promega, USA) and 0.2
U RNAguard 36.3 U/μl (Amersham-Biosciences). Specific
primers for each receptor gene were designed spanning
different exons to detect potential genomic contamination. A control PCR using primers for housekeeping genes
was also preformed in order to control the amount of
cDNA utilised in each reaction. Specific primers for Ciona
18 S ribosomal protein were designed but sea bream 18 S
and β-actin primers were routinely used in the Drosophila
and the nematode. All primers (including housekeeping
control sequences) used are described in Table 3. All the
PCR reactions were performed with 1xPCR buffer (Euroclone, Italy), 1.5 mM MgCl2 (Euroclone), 0.2 mM dNTPs
(Amersham-Biosciences), 1 mM of each primer (Forward
and Reverse) EuroTaq DNA Polymerase 5 U/μl (Euroclone) and DNase Free water (Sigma-Aldrich) for a 25 μl
final reaction volume. Amplification of all the genes was
carried out using a standard cycle with an initial denaturing step of 93°C for 2 minutes, followed by 35 cycles of:
30 s at 93°C, the annealing temperatures of primers for 60
s and 72°C for 30 seconds followed by a final chain extension step of 72°C for 5 minutes. The reaction products
were cloned into pGEMT-easy vector (Promega) and
sequenced to confirm their identity.
