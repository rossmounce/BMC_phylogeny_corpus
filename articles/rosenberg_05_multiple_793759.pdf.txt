Abstract
Background: Sequence alignment is a common tool in bioinformatics and comparative genomics.
It is generally assumed that multiple sequence alignment yields better results than pair wise
sequence alignment, but this assumption has rarely been tested, and never with the control
provided by simulation analysis. This study used sequence simulation to examine the gain in
accuracy of adding a third sequence to a pair wise alignment, particularly concentrating on how the
phylogenetic position of the additional sequence relative to the first pair changes the accuracy of
the initial pair's alignment as well as their estimated evolutionary distance.
Results: The maximal gain in alignment accuracy was found not when the third sequence is directly
intermediate between the initial two sequences, but rather when it perfectly subdivides the branch
leading from the root of the tree to one of the original sequences (making it half as close to one
sequence as the other). Evolutionary distance estimation in the multiple alignment framework,
however, is largely unrelated to alignment accuracy and rather is dependent on the position of the
third sequence; the closer the branch leading to the third sequence is to the root of the tree, the
larger the estimated distance between the first two sequences.
Conclusion: The bias in distance estimation appears to be a direct result of the standard greedy
progressive algorithm used by many multiple alignment methods. These results have implications
for choosing new taxa and genomes to sequence when resources are limited.

Background
DNA sequence alignment is a common step in molecular
evolutionary analysis. Aligned sequences are used for
many purposes, including estimation of patterns of divergence, selection, the tempo and mode of evolutionary
change, identification of functional elements and constraints, and phylogenetic history, just to name a few.
Alignments are a hypothesis of site homology; as evolutionary distance among sequences increases, alignments
are known to become less accurate [1-7]. The effect of

alignment accuracy on downstream analysis in comparative genomics and bioinformatics is largely an unexplored
topic, although some empirical studies have attempted to
examine this with respect to functional element identification [8,9] and phylogenetic analysis [10-16].
Multiple sequence alignment, the alignment of more than
two sequences, is generally thought to lead to more accurate alignments than simple pair wise alignments [4].
There are numerous approaches to multiple alignment,

tion from DNA sequences can be surprisingly robust to
alignment error (evolutionary distance is the number of
substitutions per site which have occurred since a pair of
sequences diverged from a common ancestral sequence).
This previous work was based on alignments of paired
sequences; the relationship between accuracy of alignment and distance estimation might differ under multiple
alignment conditions.
The primary goal of this study was to use simulation to
examine the improvement in alignment accuracy when
going from pair wise to multiple alignments, profiling the
change versus the position of the additional sequences.
How much is the accuracy of alignment of a pair of
sequences improved by the addition of a third sequence
with an intermediate evolutionary history (relative to the
initial pair)? Where should the third sequence be in order
to maximize the accuracy of the initial pair's alignment?
In addition, the effects of these multiple sequence alignment on evolutionary distance estimation were also profiled. Does the position of the third sequence have an
effect on the estimation of evolutionary distance of the
initial pair, independent of the accuracy of the alignments?

Results and discussion
although most are based in some way on a progressive
alignment algorithm [17,18] where similar sequences are
aligned first and additional sequences are progressively
added based on their divergence from the initial pair.
While empirical studies have demonstrated how multiple
alignments perform better than pair wise alignments
[19,20], simulation methodologies have not been
employed to characterize the improvement. In the simplest case, one can ask how much a pair wise alignment is
improved by the addition of a third sequence (of intermediate phylogenetic position relative to the initial pair).
How does varying the position of the third sequence, relative to the first two, affect the alignment? Logically, one
might hypothesize that the greatest improvement will
come when the third sequence is exactly equidistant from
the initial pair, splitting the branch separating them in
half (Figure 1); from a rooted perspective, this would be a
polytomy. On the other hand, one might expect that the
greatest improvement would be found from a third
sequence which evenly splits a branch on the rooted tree;
in an unrooted perspective this would mean the third
sequence is half as close to one of the initial sequences as
to the other (Figure 1).
Beyond simple accuracy, multiple sequence alignment
may affect downstream sequence analysis in unexpected
ways relative to pair wise sequence alignment. In a previous study [6], I show that evolutionary distance estima-

Accuracy of multiple alignments
Figure 2 shows the difference in accuracy of alignment of
sequences A and B between the three-sequence multiple
alignments (ABC alignment) and the pair wise alignments
(AB alignment) for Clustal versus the relative position of
sequence C. The pattern was consistent for the two shortest divergences (Figure 2A–B): the multiple alignment was
maximally more accurate than the pair wise alignment
when sequence C was half as divergent from one of the
target sequences than they were from each other (bottom
row of Figure 1). In the final case (Figure 2C), sequences
A and B were divergent to the point of being indistinguishable from random data [6]. Addition of the third
sequence had a small improvement when it was relatively
close to one of the original sequences, but as it moved
deeper into the phylogeny it in-and-of itself became too
divergent from sequence A to add any benefit to the alignment and actually marginally decreased the accuracy.

Figure 3 shows the identical data as relative improvement
in accuracy, with all three simulation conditions superimposed. The curves for the two moderate divergences (d =
0.5 and d = 1.0) were extremely congruent with both
showing a peak reduction of about 15% error in the multiple alignment versus the pair wise alignment. The larger
divergence (d = 2.0) is essentially flat since the changes in
absolute error seen in Figure 2C are minimal relative to
the total amount of error (~92%) in the alignments. With
respect to the actual number of sites (rather than propor-

Additional simulations for 4-taxon trees were also performed (results not shown). As would be expected from
the above results, the maximal improvement in the alignment of sequences A and B was found when the fourth
sequence was added to the center of the branch leading
from the root to sequence B. Simulations of 16-taxon
model trees were also conducted to investigate how much
improvement can be made with the addition of even
more sequences. Two extreme 16-taxon trees were used as
initial simulation models, a perfectly balanced tree and a
perfectly pectinate tree (Figure 4). For both cases, simulations with expected AB distances of both 1.0 and 2.0 were
conducted and analyzed under the same conditions as the
three-taxon phylogenies (100 replicates). The expected
accuracies of the AB sequence alignment from a pair wise
alignment for these distances are 62% and 7%, respectively [6]. The maximal accuracies when a third sequence
was added (Figure 2) were 68% and 9%. When all 16
sequences were used in a multiple alignment, the
observed accuracies of the AB alignment were, respectively, 88% and 38% for the balanced tree and 77% and
19% for the pectinate tree. Unsurprisingly, adding addi-

tional sequences had a large effect on alignment accuracy
when they were added in a balanced fashion and a smaller
effect when they were added in a pectinate fashion. Also
as would be expected, varying the internal branch lengths
(including both with and without a molecular clock) or
simulating across 16-taxon trees with more realistic
branching patterns (e.g., non clock-like Yule trees) yielded
intermediate accuracies depending on the exact shape and
structure of the tree (results not shown).
These results add an additional spin to the debate over the
importance of taxon sampling in phylogeny reconstruction. Although it is generally thought that increased taxon
sampling yields more accurate phylogenies, simulation
studies have proven to be equivocal and controversial [2129]. However, all of these studies (and most of the empirical ones as well) tacitly assume perfect sequence alignment. Even if increased taxon sampling has no direct
effect on phylogenetic accuracy (a debatable point; see
cited literature above), it certain appears to have an effect
on the accuracy of alignment prior to the phylogenetic
reconstruction process. How alignment accuracy may
directly affect phylogeny reconstruction is a topic in need
of further study (although see [30]).
These results also imply a specific strategy for choosing
species to sequence when resources are limited. For example, given current estimates of the mammalian phylogeny
[31-33], these results suggest that error in human and
mouse sequence alignments could be reduced by about
15% if aligned with a third species with an evolutionary
position similar to that of the Capuchin (Cebus albifrons)

or the blind mole rat (Spalax judaei). In contrast, inclusion
of sequences from the completed rat genome [34], would
only be expected to decrease error in human and mouse
alignments by about 7%.
Multiple alignment and evolutionary distance estimation
One would expect that estimation of evolutionary distance in a multiple alignment setting would follow that of
alignment accuracy (Figures 2, 3). For alignments in Clustal, this intuition turned out to be surprisingly incorrect.
Figure 5 shows the results of evolutionary distance estimation between sequences A and B from the true alignment,
the pair wise AB alignment, and the multiple ABC alignments. For the intermediate distances (d = 0.5 and d = 1.0)
there was a striking pattern: the estimate of distance
between sequences A and B increased linearly under the
multiple alignment as the branch leading to sequence C
moves closer to the root. This change in distance estimation was uncorrelated with that of alignment accuracy
which peaked when sequence C bisected the branch leading to sequence A (Figure 2). The slight dip at the upper
end of the curves is explained by the progressive alignment procedure: pair wise alignments and distance estimates are used to set the order of sequence addition in the
multiple alignment. When the branch leading to sequence
C was close to the root, sequences A and B will occasionally appear to be more closely related to each other than
sequence C is to A. When this occurs, A and B are aligned
directly (with C on the outside) and produce the pair wise
distance estimate which was consistently lower than that
found from the multiple alignment (Figure 5). This was
proved by realigning a subset of the data with sequence C

close to the root but specifying the (correct) guide tree
rather than allowing Clustal to estimate its own. The X
marked by an arrow in Figure 5B shows the average distance estimate from the ABC alignments when the correct
guide tree was provided; not only is the average higher
than that of the original alignments but it is directly in line
with the projected linear increase seen from the alignments where C branches closer to the tips. The largest simulated distance (d = 2.0) showed the beginning of a
similar pattern to the intermediate distances (Figure 5C)
before the alignments collapses into random noise (Figure 2C). The phylogenetic position of an intermediate
sequence appears to bias evolutionary distance estimation, independent of alignment accuracy.
The accuracy (or lack) of the pair wise distance estimates
were exactly what one would expect from previous work
[6]. To explain the observed bias in multiple alignment, I
partitioned the data that goes into the calculation of evolutionary distance into its base components: observed
numbers of transitional and transversional differences.
Figure 6 shows the breakdown for d = 0.5 and d = 1.0.
Each panel has five parts: the percent of observed sites
(between sequences A and B) with the specific change
(transition or transversion) in the true alignment; the percent of sites with the specific change in the AB alignment;
the percent of sites with the specific change in the AB
alignment that were correctly aligned (found in the true
alignment); the percent of sites with the specific change
found in the ABC alignment; and the percent of sites with
the specific change in the ABC alignment that were correctly aligned. The true and pair wise alignment both
showed the expected pattern of having no relationship
between observed (or correct) percents of change with a
change in the phylogenetic position of sequence C. For
the multiple alignment, the proportion of sites correctly
aligned (both transitions and transversions) followed the
identical pattern seen in Figure 2, that is, the peak in alignment accuracy occurs when the branch leading to
sequence C bisects the branch leading to sequence A.
However, the observed number of transversional changes
(and to a lesser extent, transitional changes) increased linearly as the branch leading to sequence C moved closer to
the root (Figure 6A,C). The bias in evolutionary distance
estimation in multiple sequence alignment appears to primarily be due to an overabundance of hypothesized transversional differences among the sequences.
Careful examination of the strict (greedy) progressive
alignment algorithm [17,18] used by Clustal explains this
pattern. When sequences A and B are aligned directly in a
pair wise alignment, the hypothesized transitions and
transversions are based solely on the properties of these
sequences. In the multiple alignment, Clustal begins by
aligning the closest pair of sequences (A and C). The more

distant sequence C is from sequence A, the more transversions will have occurred since they shared a common
ancestor. More transversions are therefore identified

(hypothesized) between this pair during alignment.
When sequence B is added to the alignment, numerous
potential transversions have already been "set" between

sequences A and C. Thus, any potential transversional difference between sequences A and B have less cost (on
average) than would be found in the corresponding pair
wise alignment because a transversion may already have
been identified between sequences A and C. The biasing
effect of phylogenetic position on distance estimation
from pair wise alignment appears to be a consequence of
the greedy progressive algorithm implemented in Clustal.

ments are also being developed [30,44-48]. Comparisons
of the overall accuracies of some of these programs in pair
wise DNA sequence analysis has recently been conducted
[7]. How these programs and algorithms compare under
multiple alignment conditions and whether the observed
biasing effect is widespread or narrow across algorithms is
a task for future investigation.

Conclusion
This study used Clustal because it is one of the most
widely used alignment programs, particularly for highthroughput genomic analysis, and tends to be among the
most accurate [7,35]. While it is quite possible that the
resulting alignments could be improved by changing
alignment parameters (such as the mismatch and gap
costs), the purpose of this study is not to optimize the
alignment but rather to examine the difference multiple
alignment makes under simple conditions and to see
examine downstream effects of these errors on distance
estimation.
To partially examine whether the observed results are specific to Clustal or may be a more general alignment problem, most of the alignments were repeated with T-Coffee
1.37 [36]. Using the default parameters, T-Coffee produced significantly worse alignments and distance estimates than Clustal (the purpose of this study was not to
compare the relative accuracy of these alignment methods
and the absolute differences may be due to default parameterization choices and not the overall quality of the
methods themselves). However, the shape of the alignment accuracy curves were the same (i.e., the peak gain in
accuracy during multiple alignment occurred when the
third sequence bisected the branch leading from the root
to sequence A). The biasing effect of the position of the
third sequence appeared to be less severe, and in some
cases, completely absent; unfortunately the differences in
accuracy made it difficult to systematically compare these
results. Unlike Clustal, T-Coffee uses both global and
local pair wise alignments to guide the production of the
final global alignment. Although it is also a progressive
algorithm, the intermediate alignments it produces make
use of more information at early stages, which may help
prevent the distance estimate bias.
There are many additional multiple DNA sequence alignment algorithms and programs available, some of which
use similar progressive alignment schemes as Clustal and
T-Coffee but allow for revision of previously aligned
sequences, and some of which use very different
approaches, including statistical alignments based on
maximum likelihood or Bayesian methods (e.g., [37-41]).
Some of these methods simultaneously estimate evolutionary distance and alignment [42,43], while methods
for simultaneously estimating phylogenies and align-

Multiple sequence alignments do improve upon pair wise
sequence alignments. The optimal taxon sampling strategy for maximally improving alignments is to bisect long
branches in a balanced framework. Independent of alignment accuracy, however, multiple alignment using a progressive algorithm can bias evolutionary distance
estimates, with larger estimates consistently found as
intermediate sequences appear deeper in the phylogeny.

Methods
In a previous study [6], it was found that the shapes of
alignment accuracy profiles (e.g., Figure 7) were largely
independent of substitution model complexity, sequence
length, and many model parameter choices. This study
generally follows the methods from the previous study.
All simulations were performed using MySSP [49]. Simulations were conducted using the Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano
(HKY) model of nucleotide substitution [50]. Initial
sequences consisted of 1000 random nucleotides, with
initial and expected nucleotide frequencies of πC = πG =
0.3, πT = πA = 0.2. The transition-transversion bias was set
to that observed at neutral sites in mammals, κ = 3.6 [51].
Initial sequences were allowed to evolve along fixed trees
representing different levels of expected divergence. The
initial sets of simulation consisted of three-taxon trees
(Figure 8), where the expected divergences of the target
sequences (A & B) were 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0. Previous work [6]
indicates that pair-wise alignments of sequences A & B at
these divergences will be about 94%, 62%, and 7% accurate, respectively, under these simulation and alignment
conditions (Figure 7). The location of the intermediate
sequence (C) was set to a variety of evenly spaced positions ranging from close to sequence A to close to the root.
In addition to point substitutions under the HKY model,
insertions and deletions were allowed to occur, with the
expected rate of deletion events being one occurrence
every 40 substitutions and the expected rate of insertion
events being one occurrence every 100 substitutions (as
observed in primates and rodents) [52]. Realized number
of insertions and deletions were drawn from a Poisson
distribution with mean equal to the expected value. The
lengths of individual insertion and deletion events were
also chosen from a truncated (so as not to include zero)
Poisson distribution with a mean of 4 bases (as observed

insertion/deletion rate and size can have a large affect on
alignment accuracy [6]. However, it is likely that changing
the values of these parameters in the present study would
have similar effects across all conditions. Each simulation
condition was replicated 1000 times.
For every simulated data set, the fate of each of the original sites was tracked and an alignment representing the
true homology was constructed for each data set (that is,
the simulation program produced gapped sequences in
which all aligned sites were truly homologous). The gaps
were removed from the sequences and data sets consisting
of all three sequences and of just sequences A and B were
constructed. Each data set was aligned using Clustal W
version 1.83 [54] with the default parameters, as is common in high-throughput analysis and comparative studies
of this sort [3,6,7,36,55-57]. This produced a hypothesized alignment, just as one would obtain from analysis of
real data.

MR designed, programmed, executed, and analyzed all
parts of this study.

The hypothesized alignments were compared to the true
alignment derived from the simulation. Evolutionary distances between sequences A and B were estimated for the
correct alignment, the AB hypothesized alignment, and
the ABC hypothesized alignment using the Tamura-Nei
formula [58].
