Abstract
Background: Exoskeletal hardening in crustaceans can be attributed to mineralization and
sclerotization of the organic matrix. Glycoproteins have been implicated in the calcification process
of many matrices. Sclerotization, on the other hand, is catalysed by phenoloxidases, which also play
a role in melanization and the immunological response in arthropods. Custom cDNA microarrays
from Portunus pelagicus were used to identify genes possibly associated with the activation pathways
involved in these processes.
Results: Two genes potentially involved in the recognition of glycosylation, the C-type lectin
receptor and the mannose-binding protein, were found to display molt cycle-related differential
expression profiles. C-type lectin receptor up-regulation was found to coincide with periods
associated with new uncalcified cuticle formation, while the up-regulation of mannose-binding
protein occurred only in the post-molt stage, during which calcification takes place, implicating both
in the regulation of calcification. Genes presumed to be involved in the phenoloxidase activation
pathway that facilitates sclerotization also displayed molt cycle-related differential expression
profiles. Members of the serine protease superfamily, trypsin-like and chymotrypsin-like, were upregulated in the intermolt stage when compared to post-molt, while trypsin-like was also upregulated in pre-molt compared to ecdysis. Additionally, up-regulation in pre- and intermolt stages
was observed by transcripts encoding other phenoloxidase activators including the putative
antibacterial protein carcinin-like, and clotting protein precursor-like. Furthermore, hemocyanin,
itself with phenoloxidase activity, displayed an identical expression pattern to that of the
phenoloxidase activators, i.e. up-regulation in pre- and intermolt.
Conclusion: Cuticle hardening in crustaceans is a complex process that is precisely timed to occur
in the post-molt stage of the molt cycle. We have identified differential expression patterns of
several genes that are believed to be involved in biomineralization and sclerotization and propose
possible regulatory mechanisms for these processes based on their expression profiles, such as the
potential involvement of C-type lectin receptors and mannose binding protein in the regulation of
calcification.

Background
Arthropods periodically undergo cyclic molting (shedding of the exoskeleton), a process that is essential for
growth, metamorphosis and reproduction. Molting in
crustaceans is divided into a number of stages: pre-molt,
ecdysis, post-molt, and intermolt [1]. Partial digestion
and reabsorption of the old exoskeleton, and the initial
deposition of a new cuticle occur during pre-molt. At ecdysis the old exoskeleton is shed, followed by the expansion, continued deposition, and hardening of the new
cuticle in post-molt, until the crab enters intermolt [2].
The crustacean intermolt cuticle is divided into four layers; the outermost is the epicuticle, beneath which lies the
exocuticle (both are deposited pre-ecdysially), and below
these are the principle and membranous layers of the
endocuticle (deposited post-ecdysially) [3-5]. The crustacean cuticle is biphasic and is composed of an intertwining organic phase, consisting of chitin rods embedded in
a protein matrix, and a mineral phase mainly comprised
of calcium salts (in the calcified regions of the cuticle) [5].
The epicuticle layer is calcified but is characterised by an
absence of chitin, instead its organic matrix is composed
of lipids and proteins. The exocuticle, and principle layer
of the endocuticle, contain both calcium salts and a
matrix of chitin and protein, whereas the membranous
layer contains the chitin-protein matrix but remains uncalcified [4,5].
Hardening of the new crustacean exoskeleton is a multifaceted process of which there are two main components:
mineralization and sclerotization. Mineralization of a
pre-formed organic matrix primarily involves the deposition of calcium salts, principally CaCO3 and Ca3(PO4)2
[6], which are deposited as calcite, vaterite, and hydroxyapatite [7] in all layers of the crustacean cuticle except the
outer epicuticle and the inner membranous layer. The preecdysial layers calcify after ecdysis and the post-ecdysial
principle layer calcifies as it is laid down [3]. Sclerotization refers to the hardening of the organic matrix itself,
and requires the enzymatic oxidation of phenols, or catechols, which then interact with the cuticular proteins and
chitin, to crosslink and harden them [8,9].
Calcification of the crustacean exoskeleton is most clearly
evident in the hard carapace of crabs and lobsters, and is
strictly regulated to occur only after ecdysis. A proposed
model for the nucleation of calcium in the cuticular
matrix of Callinectes sapidus suggests that nucleation sites
are attached to the chitin-protein matrix. Larger macromolecules shield these sites from calcium ions and prevent crystal growth [10]. Following ecdysis, an alteration
to the macro-molecules occurs to free the nucleation sites
and allow the initiation of calcification; possible alterations include deglycosylation, enzymatic cleavage or a
change in solubility [10]. Glycosylation of proteins is
important in a variety of cellular processes including the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/575

regulation of protein function, enzyme trafficking, and
immunity [11]. Glycoproteins also appear to play an
important role in the promotion and inhibition of crystal
growth during the calcification of many matrices (teeth
[12]; mollusc shells [13,14]; sea urchin [15]). Glycoproteins associated with calcification have been extracted
from the calcified exoskeletons of crustaceans [16-21].
Furthermore, marked post-ecdysial changes in the lectinbinding characteristics of mannose rich C. sapidus cuticular glycoproteins coincided with the onset of mineralization [21], pointing to an association of glycosylation
levels and the regulation of mineralization.
Sclerotization is catalysed by phenoloxidases (POs). In
addition, POs play a role in melanization and the immunological response in arthropods [22-24]. POs are produced by proteolytic cleavage from an inactive precursor,
prophenoloxidase (proPO), by a cascade of serine proteases which are themselves under tight control [25]. The
arthropod proPO system is activated by a series of patternrecognition proteins that are capable of binding to
polysaccharides (and other compounds typically associated with microorganisms), proteinases, and other factors
such as proteinase inhibitors [23]. POs are copper-containing proteins that catalyse the oxidation of phenolic
substances. They include tyrosinases, which catalyse the
hydroxylation of monophenols to o-diphenols and the
oxidation of o-diphenols to o-quinones (o-hydroxylation
of phenolic compounds followed by an oxidation of the
diphenolic products), and catecholoxidases, which catalyse only the oxidation, but not the hydroxylation step
[22,24,26]. Quinones can then be further polymerised
non-enzymatically to the black pigment, melanin [27]
which is involved in cuticle pigmentation. Studies into the
crab Cancer magister have demonstrated that the primary
source of PO activity comes from the hemocytes, which
accumulate in the connective tissue below the epidermis
during pre-molt, leading to the suggestion that these
hemocytes are stimulated to release proPO immediately
before or after ecdysis, and that the proenzyme moves
across the epidermis into the layers of the newly secreted
exoskeleton, facilitating sclerotization [22]. Hemocyanin,
an oxygen transport protein found in the hemolymph of
crustaceans and molluscs, also exhibits PO activity [2832]. Strong sequence similarities exist between arthropod
POs and hemocyanins, especially at the amino acid residues forming the copper binding sites [33]. The dual role
of hemocyanin, as an oxygen carrier and metaboliser of
phenolic compounds, raises the question of how these
processes are regulated. One model suggests that amino
acids prevent the phenolic substances, but not molecular
oxygen, from reaching the copper atoms of the active site
[29]. Removal of residues either through conformational
change or proteolysis may allow the phenols to enter and
become metabolised [29].

Crustaceans represent an excellent model for studying the
mineralization and sclerotization of an extracellular
matrix, as hardening of the newly formed exoskeleton is
under temporal regulation restricted to the post-molt
stage. This enables the study of tightly defined stages, and
the isolation of specific biochemical and molecular processes involved in exoskeletal hardening. Many types of
cuticle proteins have been shown to be integrated into the
exoskeleton of crustaceans [34,35], however the molecular mechanisms involved in cuticle hardening remain
poorly understood. In this study we have used a microarray approach to identify a suite of genes potentially associated with the activation pathways and enzyme cascades
involved in the mineralization and sclerotization of the
crustacean cuticle.

Results
Microarray expression analysis
Dual channel microarray hybridisation experiments were
used to identify differentially expressed genes across consecutive molt stages during the molt cycle of P. pelagicus.
The temporal differential expression patterns for genes relevant to cuticle hardening are summarised in Tables 1, 2,
3, 4 (multiple values for different transcripts indicate individual cDNA expression levels within a contig), comparing post-molt and intermolt, intermolt and early premolt, and late pre-molt and ecdysis. A graphic representation of the log2 fold change in gene expression across molt
stage comparisons is depicted in Figure 1. 280 unique
transcripts were identified within the scope of the microarray experiments described, however only those potentially associated with cuticle hardening will be discussed
in this paper.
Comparison of differential expression between post-molt
(Cy3) and intermolt (Cy5)
Two unique mannose-binding protein transcripts were
up-regulated by a combined average of 8.8-fold in the
post-molt stage when compared to intermolt. The mannose-binding protein transcripts contain a C-type lectin
domain and a signal peptide. Mannose-binding protein
transcripts were not found to be differentially expressed in
any other molt stage comparison. Additionally the mRNA
coding for the C-type lectin receptor was up-regulated 3.8fold in post-molt, this transcript was also up-regulated in
early pre-molt when compared to intermolt and in late
pre-molt when compared to ecdysis. The C-type lectin
receptor contains a C-type lectin domain, a signal peptide
and transmembrane region, indicating that it may be
secreted across the membrane. The level of up-regulation
of these transcripts is detailed in Table 1.

Eight unique transcripts of hemocyanin were isolated during this study, corresponding to subunits 1â3 and 5 of C.
magister. The combined average level of up-regulation

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/575

observed for hemocyanin during the intermolt stage when
compared against post-molt was 8.2-fold. Trypsin-like
and chymotrypsin-like transcripts were also found to be
up-regulated in intermolt compared to post-molt, at 8.2
and 5-fold respectively. In addition trypsin-like transcripts
were up-regulated in late pre-molt when compared with
ecdysis. Interestingly two transcripts coding for proteins
similar to those typically associated with immune function in other species, the carcinin-like (antibacterial protein) and one similar to clotting protein precursor,
displayed molt cycle-related differential expression profiles. The carcinin-like transcript was up-regulated by 3.4fold in intermolt when compared to post-molt while the
one similar to clotting protein precursor displayed a 5.6fold increase in expression. Carcinin-like and clotting protein precursor-like were also up-regulated in late pre-molt
when compared against ecdysis. Details of these results
are shown in Table 2.
Comparison of differential expression between intermolt
(Cy3) and early pre-molt (Cy5)
The C-type lectin receptor was the only gene associated
with cuticle hardening that was differentially expressed
between intermolt and early pre-molt. Up-regulation, by
11.8-fold, in early pre-molt was observed for the C-type
lectin receptor transcript. Details of expression levels are
depicted in Table 3.
Comparison of differential expression between early premoult (Cy3) and late pre-moult (Cy5)
Microarray analysis indicates that no statistically significant differential gene expression can be observed between
the early pre-moult and late pre-moult stages.
Comparison of differential expression between late premolt (Cy3) and ecdysis (Cy5)
Transcripts for carcinin-like and clotting protein precursor-like displayed an up-regulation of 8.8 and 7.6-fold
respectively, in late pre-molt when compared against
crabs in ecdysis. The C-type lectin receptor was 8-fold upregulated in late pre-molt. Seven of the eight hemocyanin
transcripts isolated in this study, also displayed up-regulation, by a combined average of 6.8-fold, in late pre-molt
when compared to ecdysis. Furthermore transcripts for a
trypsin-like gene were up-regulated by 6.2-fold in late premolt. Details of these expression levels are presented in
Table 4.
Comparison of differential expression between ecdysis
(Cy3) and post-moult (Cy5)
Microarray analysis found no statistically significant differential gene expression between ecdysis and the postmoult stage of the moult cycle.

Discussion
Cuticle hardening is integral to the molting process in
arthropods. The principle components of hardening in
the newly formed crustacean exoskeleton are calcification
and sclerotization. Calcification involves the incorporation of calcium salts into both the pre- and post-ecdysial
layers of the crustacean exoskeleton after molting. Sclerotization involves the 'tanning' of cuticular proteins by
sclerotizing compounds, such as phenols, which become
oxidized and interact with proteins and chitin in the cuticular matrix, to cross-link and harden them. Many proteins
involved in exoskeletal calcification and sclerotization
have been isolated, yet these processes still remain poorly
understood in crustaceans. The objective of this study was
to examine the process of cuticle hardening using a holistic, gene expression profiling approach. A P. pelagicus
cDNA microarray developed in our laboratory was used to
identify genes involved in the hardening of the crustacean
exoskeleton during the molting process, and to trace their
expression profiles across the entire molt cycle. The microarray chips contain 5000 cDNAs derived from both the
entire animal and individual organs such as the brain, eyestalk, MO and Y-organ from all molt cycle stages. Thus the
arrays were designed to study global gene expression profiles of transcripts relevant to the molting process, across
the entire molt cycle. Microarray technology offers the
potential to examine the expression patterns of many
genes simultaneously, thus gaining a more comprehensive understanding of gene function, interaction, and regulation.
Glycoproteins have been implicated in the control of calcification in diverse structural matrices of both vertebrates
[36,37] and invertebrates [16]. Glycosylation of cuticular
proteins is thought to be a regulator of biomineralization
of the crustacean exoskeleton [16,21]. It has been proposed that glycoproteins act as pre-molt inhibitors of cal-

cification in the exocuticle, and that deglycosylation post
ecdysis may remove this barrier to mineralization [10,16].
While the extent of cuticular protein glycosylation can not
be determined by gene expression data, as glycosylation is
an extensive modification to protein structure that occurs
post-translationally, we have, through microarray expression analysis, identified two genes, C-type lectin receptor
and mannose-binding protein, that may be relevant to the
molt cycle-related alteration of cuticular glycoproteins
described elsewhere. In our study, transcripts of the C-type
lectin receptor display an up-regulation during early premolt (11.8-fold) when compared to intermolt, an up-regulation in late pre-molt of 8-fold when compared to ecdysis, and an up-regulation of 3.8-fold in post-molt when
compared to intermolt (Figure 1). The temporal expression patterns of the C-type lectin receptor of P. pelagicus
point to its involvement in the inhibition of calcification
of the crustacean exoskeleton. The high level of up-regulation observed in the pre-molt stages, and up-regulation
also in post-molt, coincide with formation of new cuticle.
The newly deposited cuticle must remain uncalcified in
the pre-molt stage conferring the pliability required for
ecdysis as well as growth. The cuticle then hardens following ecdysis and expansion. On the other hand the membranous layer, arthrodial membranes, gills and the gut
remain uncalcified at all times. Therefore a mechanism
facilitating the regulation of calcification is required. Ctype lectin (calcium dependent lectin group) receptors are
involved in immunity by contributing to the recognition
of pathogens through the binding of glycoproteins [38],
where binding specificity varies according to differences in
glycosylation [11,39]. The up-regulation of C-type lectin
receptor in P. pelagicus, observed pre- and post-molt, is
consistent with providing anti-calcification properties, by
way of glycoprotein affinity, to uncalcified cuticle. We
propose that in addition to its role in immunity, the Ctype lectin receptor recognises and attaches to endog-

fication. If glycosylation of cuticular proteins inhibits calcification, and, as deglycosylation of cuticular proteins
(via lectin affinity assays) has been observed post ecdysis
to coincide with the calcification of the exoskeleton [1618,20], the presence of a lectin such as mannose-binding
protein during post-molt may facilitate calcification via
deglycosylation of the cuticular proteins. Our hypothesis
is that C-type lectin receptors either facilitate the glycosylation of cuticular proteins, or bind to the sugar moieties of the glycosylated cuticle proteins themselves, thus
preventing calcium salts from entering the calcium nucleation site. Following ecdysis, the mannose-binding protein either binds to the mannose rich regions of the
glycosylated cuticular proteins, or through competitive
binding dislodges the C-type lectin receptor that is
attached to the glycosylated cuticular proteins, thereby
causing conformational changes to the glycoprotein, or
facilitating deglycosylation, thus freeing the calcium
nucleation sites and enabling the process of biomineralization to occur. A diagrammatic representation of this
proposed model of calcification regulation is depicted in
Figure 2. This hypothesis is consistent with in-vitro lectin
binding assays that report the deglycosylation of cuticular
proteins post ecdysis [16-18,20].
POs in insects and crustaceans participate in innate
immunity, pigmentation, wound healing and repair of
the damaged exoskeleton, as well as hardening (via sclerotization) of the exoskeleton after molting [9,23]. PO is
activated by a serine protease activation cascade [23].
With relation to the immune system, this activation of
zymogenic proPO into active PO is triggered by the presence of minute amounts of compounds of microbial origins such as Î²-glucans, lipopolysaccharides, and
peptidoglycans [23]. These compounds are recognised by
pattern recognition receptors. A pathway involved in
innate immunity, the lectin pathway, uses a pattern recognition receptor, the mannose-binding lectin, which upon
recognition of an infectious agent, triggers the activation
of the lectin-complement pathway, through mannosebinding lectin associated serine proteases (members of
the serine protease superfamily) [40,41]. Prominent ligands for mannose binding lectin are D-mannose and N-

acetyl-D-glucosamine [40]. Components of this pathway
have been isolated from ascidians, lampreys, frogs and
mammals [40]. Lectins (carbohydrate-binding proteins),
thus, play an important role in innate immunity by recognising the glyco-profiles of a wide range of pathogens and
triggering PO activation [11,40]. Considering the involvement of POs in the sclerotization of the arthropod cuticle,
the role of mannose binding protein in the activation of
serine proteases, and its specific up-regulation exclusively
during post-molt, we suspect that the glycosylation of
cuticle proteins and their recognition by mannose-binding protein, may also participate in the PO activation
pathway, leading to sclerotization of the cuticle in addition to its proposed role in calcification described above.
Trypsin and chymotrypsin also belong to the serine protease superfamily. Like most proteolytic enzymes, both
are synthesized as inactive zymogen precursors (trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen) to prevent untimely enzyme
activity [42]. Trypsin and chymotrypsin are structurally
very similar, although they recognise different substrates.
Trypsin acts on lysine and arginine residues, while chymotrypsin acts on large hydrophobic residues such as tryptophan, tyrosine and phenylalanine [43]. Trypsin was
shown to directly activate PO in the cuticle of the lobster
Panulirus argus [44]. The authors also tested the intrinsic
activity of lobster PO in the cuticle, throughout the molt
cycle. The inactive forms of PO increased steadily from
post-molt through to the early pre-molt stage, while the
highest level of intrinsic activation of PO in the cuticle of
lobsters was observed in late pre-molt [44]. Molt cyclerelated differential expression of trypsin-like and chymotrypsin-like cDNAs, was also observed in our study.
Trypsin-like transcripts were found to be 6.2-fold up-regulated in late pre-molt compared to ecdysis, and 8.2-fold
up-regulated in intermolt compared to post-molt (Figure
1). Chymotrypsin-like transcripts however, were up-regulated (5-fold) only in intermolt when compared to postmolt. The lack of chymotrypsin-like up-regulation in late
pre-molt indicates a functional difference in PO activation
with respect to trypsin-like, indicating that different proPOs may be involved in the sclerotization process in the
crustacean cuticle. The up-regulation of trypsin-like tran-

scripts in pre-molt and intermolt mimics the expression
pattern of a serine protease prophenoloxidase-activating
factor (PPAF), discovered in the cuticle of C. sapidus [25].
High transcript levels of PPAF were observed in C. sapidus
at the pre-molt stage, levels dropped at ecdysis and began
to increase again 24 hours after ecdysis [25]. These data

suggest that serine protease mediated PO activation is
molt cycle-related, and is up-regulated in intermolt and
prior to molting. The up-regulation of trypsin-like and
chymotrypsin-like transcripts in the intermolt period
compared to post-molt observed here, suggests that they
may be required for cuticle sclerotization in the final

Alternative conceptual models depicting the proposed involvement of C-type lectin receptors and mannose
binding protein in the regulation of calcification. A C-type lectin receptors bind to the cuticle protein thus facilitating
glycosylation. Mannose binding protein binds to glycosylated regions thereby exposing the calcium nucleation site and enabling
calcification, by either conformational change (A1) or deglycosylation (A2). B C-type lectin receptor binds to the sugar moieties of the glycosylated cuticle proteins, masking the calcification nucleation site. Competitive binding by the mannose binding
protein to the glycosylation sites facilitates calcification exposing the calcium nucleation site either through conformational
change to the cuticle protein (B1) or by deglycosylation (B2).

stages of hardening, as proposed for PPAF in C. sapidus.
The up-regulation of trypsin-like in the late pre-molt
period compared to ecdysis, implies that the enzyme is
either synthesised and remains in an inactive form before
it is required for cuticle sclerotization post ecdysis, or that
it may activate POs, before the old exoskeleton is shed, to
promote melanization (pigment deposition) in the new
cuticle.
Hemocyanin is phylogenetically related to POs, however
unlike POs, hemolymph hemocyanin is not able to catalyse the conversion of monophenols to diphenols, but is
only able to covert diphenols to o-quinones [22]. Eight
distinct transcripts of hemocyanin displayed molt cyclerelated differential expression in this study, five of these
correspond to subunits 1â3 and 5, previously isolated
from C. magister. Hemocyanin has been located in the
cuticle of crustaceans; it was detected in the cuticle of the
prawn Penaeus japonicus during the intermolt and postmolt stages, however not in the pre-molt stage [28]. In our
study hemocyanin transcripts were up-regulated in the
late pre-molt stage (combined average of 6.8-fold) when
compared to ecdysis, and in the intermolt period by 8.2fold when compared to post-molt (Figure 1). Given that
there is a temporal delay between the synthesis of hemocyanin in the hepatopancreas and its subsequent deposition in the cuticle, the up-regulation of hemocyanin
transcripts in the late pre-molt period is likely to precede
its incorporation in the cuticle during post-molt. Similarly, the length of the intermolt period, and the continued synthesis and/or repair of the exoskeleton into the
intermolt stage, supports the premise that up-regulation
of hemocyanin transcripts in intermolt occurs prior to the
incorporation of hemocyanin into the intermolt cuticle.
The enzymatic activity of cuticular hemocyanin has been
demonstrated to be higher than that of hemocyanin from
the hemolymph, and capable of catalysing both consecutive PO reactions: the o-hydroxylation of tyrosine and the
oxidation of dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) to
dopaquinone [28]. The molt cycle-related transcript
expression profile established in this study, together with
the protein localisation and enzyme activity of hemocyanin [28], are indicative of the importance of hemocyanin
mediated PO activity in the exoskeletal sclerotization
process.
Proteins involved with the crustacean coagulation cascade, have been linked to PO activation [32]. An experiment describing the functional activation (without
proteolytic cleavage) of PO activity in hemocyanin by a
clotting enzyme in the horseshoe crab [32], suggests that
the binding of the clotting protein may lead to a conformational change in hemocyanin allowing large phenolic
compounds to enter the active site, thus promoting PO
activity. Treatment of hemocyanin with SDS also enables

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/575

non-enzymatic PO activation via conformational change
[45]. In our study we observed that transcripts of a clotting
protein precursor-like gene were up-regulated by 5.6-fold
in the intermolt stage when compared to post-molt, and
by 7.6-fold in late pre-molt compared to ecdysis (Figure
1). These data show that clotting protein precursor-like is
expressed in the intermolt and pre-molt period, and is
analogous to the expression profile of hemocyanin
described above. The concomitant up-regulation of
hemocyanin and clotting protein precursor-like gene during the molt cycle of P. pelagicus, together with their associated PO activity, suggests that these compounds play a
role in the sclerotization and/or melanization of the crustacean exoskeleton.
The putative antimicrobial peptide carcinin-like was also
up-regulated in the intermolt stage (3.4-fold) when compared to post-molt, and by 8.8-fold in late pre-molt compared to ecdysis (Figure 1). Antimicrobial peptides are
also able to induce the intrinsic PO activity of hemocyanin in horseshoe crabs [31]. Furthermore, antimicrobial
peptides have been isolated from the cuticle of the horseshoe crab [46], suggesting that they may facilitate the sclerotization of the cuticle, in addition to acting as
antimicrobial substances. In fact other potential PO activator transcripts that have also been associated with
immunity such as trypsin-like and clotting protein precursor-like as discussed above, also follow this expression
profile.

Conclusion
Biomineralization is, at least partly, controlled by the
organic matrix itself, in which the three dimensional
arrangement and overall composition of the entire matrix
determines the function at any given time [13]. Organic
matrices are thought to regulate biomineralization in a
variety of ways: by initiation of crystal growth, determination of crystal polymorph, control of crystal shape and termination of crystal growth [47]. Glycosylation of cuticular
proteins has been found to affect their calcification at critical periods during the molt cycle [16,21]. We have demonstrated that the C-type lectin receptor and mannose
binding protein display molt cycle-related differential
expression profiles, and propose possible regulatory functions for these proteins in the calcification of crustacean
cuticle. Additionally the up-regulation of PO inducers
such as trypsin-like, clotting protein precursor-like and
antimicrobial proteins, in conjunction with hemocyanin,
suggests that multiple PO activation pathways may modulate the sclerotization cascade in the exoskeleton of P.
pelagicus. The expression of these activators in the intermolt and pre-molt stages, before ecdysis occurs, suggests
that they are synthesised prior to their utilization, and
remain in an inactive form until they become "triggered",
perhaps via a change in glycosylation, to activate the PO

cascade. In addition to their proposed role in the calcification of cuticular proteins, C-type lectin receptor and mannose-binding protein may also regulate the activation of
the PO pathway by virtue of their affinity for glycoproteins.

Methods
Animal selection
P. pelagicus crabs were supplied by staff at the Department
of Primary Industries & Fisheries (DPI&F) Bribie Island
Aquaculture Research Centre (BIARC). The crabs were
individually housed in a flowthrough system at an ambient water temperature of 24Â°C, and fed a commercial diet
(Ebistar, Higashimaru, Japan) twice daily. Two size
groups of crabs were used, small crabs of an average carapace width of 4 cm, and larger crabs of an average carapace width of 11 cm. All crabs were molt staged by
examination of pleopod paddles for epidermal retraction
and grouped into the following molt stages; molt (shedding of the exoskeleton), post-molt (pliable exoskeleton),
intermolt (hard exoskeleton with no evidence of epidermal retraction) early and late stage pre-molt (based on the
extent of epidermal retraction) [48].
cDNA library construction
Two cDNA libraries were constructed using various source
tissues, selected in order to provide a diverse collection of
transcripts, and representing a broad range of tissue functions and physiological states in all molt stages. One of
the cDNA libraries was synthesised from whole animals in
order to obtain transcripts from each tissue type. For this
library, six small crabs, from each of the following five
molt stages; molt, post-molt, intermolt, early and late premolt stages, were selected, snap frozen and ground under
liquid nitrogen. The other cDNA library, was derived from
organs previously identified as being important to the
molt cycle of crustaceans and served to enrich the array
with sequences particularly relevant to crustacean molting. The tissues represented in the P. pelagicus organ
library were brain, eyestalk, mandibular organ (MO) and
Y-organ. These tissues were obtained from six anaesthetised large P. pelagicus crabs from each of molt, post-molt,
intermolt, and early and late pre-molt stages, and stored
in RNA later (Ambion, Austin, USA).

Total RNA was purified from each tissue sample using
TRIZOL reagent as recommended by the manufacturer
(Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Concentration and purity of the RNA were determined using a
spectrophotometer (GeneQuant Pro, GE Healthcare UK
Ltd., Buckinghamshire, England) with 260 and 280 nm
readings. RNA quality was assessed for all samples by visualisation on a denaturing formaldehyde RNA gel (protocol recommended by Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and
ethidium bromide staining. Each cDNA library was con-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/575

structed by pooling equal amounts of total RNA from all
molt cycle stages.
A commercial cDNA library synthesis system (SMART
cDNA library construction kit, Clonetech, Mountain
View, CA, USA) was used for the construction of each
library according to the manufacturer's instructions. Only
the final cloning step was modified so that instead of
using the Î» TriplEx2 vector supplied with the kit, the size
fractionated cDNA was ligated into pGEM-T Easy
(Promega, Madison, WI, USA) as per manufacturer's
instructions, and transformed into XL10 Gold ultracompetent cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) according to
the manufacturer's protocol. 80 clones, randomly selected
from each library, were then sequenced and analysed
using BLAST http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/ to
determine gene redundancy. The primer used for sequencing was the 5'SMARTlibPCR primer (5'-AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGT-3') a modification of the SMART IV
oligonucleotide supplied with the SMART cDNA library
construction kit (Clonetech).
Screening for redundant clones
Upon examination of 160 clones, from the cDNA libraries
of both whole crab and crab organ, redundancies for 16S
ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes were found to be as high as
30%. To remove 16S rRNA carrying plasmids, all of the
clones were first screened for the 16S rRNA sequence,
using a colony hybridisation method [49]. Briefly three
probes, (500 bp, 344 bp and 300 bp in length) were
designed from separate regions of the 16S rRNA sequence.
These probes were PCR amplified and labelled with 32P,
then hybridised to clones that had been fixed to nitrocellulose filters. Following an overnight incubation at 55Â°C
in hybridisation buffer (6Ã SSC and 1% SDS), the filters
were washed twice at 55Â°C in a solution of 6Ã SSC and
0.2% SDS for 30 min, sealed within plastic and exposed
onto autoradiography films (GE Healthcare UK Ltd.) at 70Â°C using intensifying screens. The films were then
developed according to supplier's instructions.
Construction of custom P. pelagicus cDNA microarrays
5000 unsequenced clones, that had been pre-screened for
16S ribosomal RNA, were randomly selected for spotting
onto the microarray slides. 2400 were selected from the
whole crab library and 2600 from the crab organ library.
These were grown overnight in LB containing 50 Î¼g/ml
ampicillin. The clones were sent to the AgGenomics (Bundoora, Vic, Australia) microarray printing facility. The
clones were PCR amplified using kit-supplied primers
(Clontech) and contact-spotted (in duplicate) using pins,
onto amino silane coated glass slides, in a 50% DMSO
buffer. Known crab genes, which were identified at the initial sequencing stage, such as actin [GenBank:EF110528],
cryptocyanin [GenBank:EF102021], hemocyanin [Gen-

Bank:EF110534], metallothionein [GenBank:EF110529],
opsin [GenBank:EF110527] and ubiquitin [GenBank:EF110526] were spotted onto the arrays for use as
controls. Genes specifically associated with the molting
process such as molt-inhibiting hormone (MIH) [GenBank:EF110524], crustacean hyperglycaemic hormone
(CHH) [GenBank:EF110525] and farnesoic acid methyl
transferase (FaMeT) long isoform [GenBank:DQ085282]
[50], were isolated separately from P. pelagicus through the
design of gene specific primers and spotted on to the
arrays. In addition universal reference RNA standard controls (Lucidea, GE Healthcare UK Ltd.) were also spotted
onto each array, as were negative control spots of 50%
DMSO (without cDNA). The cDNA was bound to the
slide surface by baking and UV crosslinking.
Experimental Design
In order to identify differential gene expression across
molt stages, two consecutive molt stages were compared
on each array in a dual colour (Cy3 and Cy5) experiment.
RNA samples were pooled across subjects in order to
reduce the effect of biological variation. A formula, which
dictates the total number of subjects and arrays required
for the pooled experiment to obtain gene expression estimates and confidence intervals comparable to those
obtained from a non-pooled experiment [51], gave 90%
confidence if nine subjects were pooled across a total of
three arrays. To this effect, equal amounts of total RNA
from three crabs in one molt stage, were pooled, and compared against equal amounts of total RNA pooled from
three crabs in another molt stage, on one array. This was
repeated three times in total, the different molt stages
were labelled with Cy3 or Cy5 respectively. Consecutive
molt stages were compared in the following format; postmolt (Cy3) with intermolt (Cy5), intermolt (Cy3) with
early pre-molt (Cy5), early pre-molt (Cy3) with late premolt (Cy5), late pre-molt (Cy3) with ecdysis (Cy5), and
ecdysis (Cy3) with post-molt (Cy5).

Technical variation, that is array-to-array variability, in
these microarray experiments, was addressed through
spot duplication. Two identical grids consisting of each
amplified cDNA and including the controls described
above were printed onto the left and right sides of each
horizontally orientated array, thus affording spatial separation between duplicate spots, to allow for the normalisation of potential hybridisation anomalies.
Microarray Hybridisations
Nine small crabs (six of these were also used in the above
described whole crab cDNA library construction) were
snap frozen, ground under liquid nitrogen and RNA was
isolated using TRIZOL reagent as recommended by the
manufacturer (Invitrogen Life Technologies). The RNA
was DNase treated using RQ1 RNase free DNase

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/575

(Promega) as per manufacturer's instructions and purified
using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) as recommended by the
manufacturer. RNA quality was assessed by visualisation
on a denaturing formaldehyde RNA gel (protocol recommended by Qiagen) using ethidium bromide staining.
Concentration and purity of the RNA were determined by
measuring the absorbance at 260 nm and 280 nm using a
spectrophotometer (GeneQuant Pro). One microgram of
Lucidea universal RNA control (GE Healthcare) was
added to 10 Î¼g of pooled total RNA for each molt stage
sample, the RNA was converted to cDNA then labelled
and hybridised to the array using the 3DNA Array 900
MPX expression array detection kit (Genisphere Inc., Hatfield, PA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
Briefly, RNA was reverse transcribed using a random
primer combined with an oligo dT primer. The RNA was
then degraded and the cDNA tailed with dTTP followed
by ligation to a dendrimer-specific capture oligo (specific
for either Cy3 or Cy5). Microarray slides were denatured
prior to use by immersion in 95Â°C MilliQ water for 5
minutes, the slides were then transferred to 95% ethanol
at room temperature for 2 minutes. Slides were spun dry
to reduce streaking at 800 RPM for 2 minutes. The Cy3
and Cy5 "tagged" cDNAs were combined and then
hybridised to the array by overnight incubation in a
humidity chamber at 65Â°C using the kit supplied non-formamide SDS-based buffer and a poly T based blocker, as
per manufacturer's specifications. The "tagged" cDNA was
washed with a series of three SSC-based buffers, the first
wash occurred at 65Â°C for 15 min, the other wash steps
were carried out at room temperature for 10 min each. The
slides were spun dry at 800 RPM for 2 minutes. Fluorescent 3DNA capture reagent (which carries a sequence
complementary to the Cy3 and Cy5 tag) was then hybridised to the array using the SDS-based buffer with added
Anti-Fade reagent (inhibits photobleaching of Cy 5) at
65Â°C for four hours. The fluorescent reagent was then
washed as described above for the cDNA hybridisation.
Data analysis
Microarray slides were scanned using a white-light ArrayWorx Biochip Reader (Applied Precision, LLC, Issaquah,
Washington, USA). ImaGene (BioDiscovery Inc., El Segundo, CA, USA) was then used to process images and create spot intensity reports, while CloneTracker
(Biodiscovery Inc.) was used to generate gene ID mapping
files and assign gene identification. Final intensity reports
were retrieved as raw spot intensities in tab-delimited
files. The data set is deposited in the Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO) database (accession no. GSE6997) at the
following site: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/.

Microarray data analysis was performed by Emphron
Informatics (Chapel Hill, Qld, Australia). Briefly, data was
normalised using the robust scatter plot smoother LOESS

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:575

(also known as "LOWESS" for locally-weighted regression
and smoothing scatter plots) [52]. For each chip, normalisation was applied to the left and right sides separately
(spatial positioning of clones spotted in duplicate was in
the format of two grids located on the left and right side
of each array when orientated horizontally). Individual
microarray quality was assessed using M vs A scatter plots.
M-A plots were constructed for each slide, where the logintensity ratio M = log(Cy3/Cy5) = [logCy3 - logCy5] were
plotted against the mean log-intensity A = [(logCy3 +
logCy5)/2] as described by [53]. Potential dye intensity
biases in the microarray data sets were assessed by examining the back-to-back histograms of Cy3 and Cy5 expression. Since each feature is spotted onto an array in
duplicate, and three biological replicates are performed
per molt stage comparison, a standard error, a t-statistic,
and t-distribution (P value) can be calculated for each feature represented on the array. Standard errors were based
on the mean of technical replicates for a given slide. For
each of the features on the slide, a P value for differential
expression was calculated using the empirical Bayes procedure [54]. These P values were then adjusted using the
False Discovery Rate (FDR) procedure [55]. This conservative procedure provides control of the Family-Wise Error
Rate (FWER), which is the probability of at least one false
positive. The advantage of controlling the FWER is that
any features identified as differentially expressed are
highly likely to be so, however, the disadvantage is that it
is easier to omit features that are differentially expressed.
Differential gene expression was only considered significant if the (FDR) adjusted P value was less than 0.05.
These genes are listed in the results section where M is the
log2 fold change in expression and t is the t-statistic. Positive values of M and t indicate up-regulation in the Cy3
sample whereas negative values of M and t indicate downregulation in the Cy3 sample. Genes were considered upor down-regulated when the logarithm of the gene expression ratio (M) was more than 1 or less than -1, that is there
was a 2-fold (or greater) difference in expression levels.
Sequence and phylogenetic analysis
Following hybridisation experiments, clones which displayed differential expression (P â¤ 0.05) patterns across
molt stages were sequenced. Overlapping sequences (contigs), that likely represent the same cDNA, and clones
without sequence identity to other cDNAs (singlets) were
identified by comparing all sequences against one another
in sequencher (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI,
USA). The genes were annotated with the name of the
highest basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) [56]
score from an analysis of GenBank entries by the BLASTx
and BLASTn procedures. Protein domains were identified
from the Pfam database [57], and InterProScan http://
www.ebi.ac.uk/InterProScan.
