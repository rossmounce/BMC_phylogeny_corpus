Abstract
Background: As exemplified by the famously successful model organism Caenorhabditis elegans, nematodes offer
outstanding animal systems for investigating diverse biological phenomena due to their small genome sizes, short
generation times and ease of laboratory maintenance. Nematodes in the genus Panagrolaimus have served in
comparative development and anhydrobiosis studies, and the Antarctic species P. davidi offers a powerful
paradigm for understanding the biological mechanisms of extreme cold tolerance. Panagrolaimus nematodes are
also unique in that examples of gonochoristic, hermaphroditic and parthenogenetic reproductive modes have
been reported for members of this genus. The evolutionary origins of these varying reproductive modes and the
Antarctic species P. davidi, however, remain enigmatic.
Results: We collected nuclear ribosomal RNA gene and mitochondrial protein-coding gene sequences from
diverse Panagrolaimus species and strains, including newly discovered isolates from Oregon, to investigate
phylogenetic relationships in this nematode genus. Nuclear phylogenies showed that the species and strains
historically identified as members of Panagrolaimus constitute a paraphyletic group, suggesting that taxonomic
revision is required for Panagrolaimus and related nematode lineages. Strain-specific reproductive modes were
mapped onto the molecular phylogeny to show a single origin of parthenogenesis from a presumably
gonochoristic ancestor. The hermaphroditic strains were all placed outside a major monophyletic clade that
contained the majority of other Panagrolaimus nematodes. Phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial sequences
showed that substantial molecular and geographic diversity exists within the clade of parthenogenetic strains. The
Antarctic species P. davidi was found to be very closely related to two Panagrolaimus strains from southern
California. Phylogenetic and molecular clock analyses suggested that P. davidi and the California strain PS1579
shared a common ancestor in the very recent evolutionary past.
Conclusion: Our study provides a phylogenetic framework for understanding the evolutionary origins and
diversification patterns of varying reproductive modes within Panagrolaimus and important insights into the origin
of the Antarctic species P. davidi. Panagrolaimus offers a powerful nematode model for understanding diverse
evolutionary phenomena including the evolution of asexuality and the adaptive evolution of extreme cold
tolerance.

Background
The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has long served as an
exceptional model system for understanding diverse biological phenomena such as development, neurobiology
and genome structure [1-3]. Over the last decade nematodes in the Caenorhabditis genus have come to serve as
increasingly powerful evolutionary models for studying
diverse processes ranging from the mutation rate [4-6] to
the evolution of reproductive mode transitions [7,8] to
speciation mechanisms [9-11]. Although C. elegans and C.
briggsae were originally thought to share a common origin
of hermaphroditic reproduction, more recent molecular
phylogenetic approaches have shown independent origins of hermaphroditism for these two Caenorhabditis species [12]. There exists over one million genetically diverse
nematode species outside of Caenorhabditis [13,14] that
are also coming to serve roles as models for other evolutionary phenomena. For example, nematodes in the genera Strongyloides and Rhabditophanes are growing models
for understanding the evolution of parasitism [15];
Oscheius and Pristionchus nematodes offer strong models
for investigating the evolution of developmental processes [16-19]. Multiple independent evolutionary transitions from gonochoristic to hermaphroditic reproduction
have also been observed in the latter two nematode genera [17,20] and a broad review of numerous rhabditid
nematodes showed up to ten independent transitions to
hermaphroditism [21].
Panagrolaimus nematodes have also played roles in comparative evolution of development studies [16,22,23],
and Panagrolaimus constitutes the only nematode genus in
which three different reproductive modes (gonochoristic,
hermaphroditic and parthenogenetic) have been
reported. Well-studied parthenogenetic strains of Panagrolaimus include a number of isolates from North America
(e.g. PS1579) as well as P. davidi from Antarctica; the latter
has been shown to reproduce through meiotic parthenogenesis [24]. More recently this group has emerged as a
model for understanding the physiological and molecular
mechanisms underlying anhydrobiosis and extreme cold
tolerance, due in part to the discovery of P. davidi in Antarctica. This species has evolved multiple strategies to deal
with extreme cold including cryoprotective dehydration
and the prevention and tolerance of intracellular freezing
in adults and eggs [25-33]. A recent comparative analysis
of extreme cold tolerance showed that the majority of
individuals in experimental lab populations of P. davidi
survived -15°C treatments (~80% survival) whereas much
lower survival rates (all < 20%) were observed in five
other nematode species surveyed, including P. davidi's
congener P. rigidus [25]. Panagrolaimus strain PS443 survived over eight years in a state of anhydrobiosis [34].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/15

A previous phylogenetic analysis of Panagrolaimus species
and strain relationships based on ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
internal transcribed spacer regions showed that a number
of strains in the same monophyletic clade as P. davidi were
able to survive desiccation treatments at high rates
whereas others outside that clade were much more sensitive to desiccation [35]. Although this initial study provided important insights into the evolutionary
relationships of different Panagrolaimus strains and species, it was limited by inclusion of only eleven Panagrolaimus strains and the use of only one very distantly
related outgroup (C. elegans). The evolutionary origins of
varying reproductive modes across different Panagrolaimus
lineages remain unknown, as do the origins of the lineage
leading to the Antarctic species P. davidi.
Here we provide an extensive evolutionary analysis of
thirty-one Panagrolaimus species and strains that utilizes
both slowly-evolving nuclear loci and a faster-evolving
mitochondrial locus to provide insights into the phylogenetic relationships of different lineages and to map the
origins of parthenogenetic and hermaphroditic reproductive modes. Strain-specific reproductive modes were analyzed by assaying for the presence of sperm using
microscopy techniques. To provide a rough estimate of
the general timeline for P. davidi's arrival in Antarctica, we
extended a molecular clock approach previously applied
to Caenorhabditis [36] to approximate the divergence time
between P. davidi and its closest known relative.

Results and discussion
Panagrolaimus strains and reproductive mode analysis
We initiated our study by requesting available Panagrolaimus strains from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center and
other helpful colleagues (see Table 1). Further, in the summer of 2007 we sampled soils from diverse locations
around Oregon and discovered seven additional Panagrolaimus isolate strains from which laboratory cultures were
generated and frozen stocks were made. A total of thirtyone strains were collected from our colleagues and the
field that were successfully established in laboratory culture (Table 1). Four additional nematode strains isolated
in Monroe, Oregon, USA (LD3, LD6, LD7 and LD8) were
used for molecular analyses but were not kept in longterm laboratory culture. We are able to maintain the
thirty-one Panagrolaimus strains listed in Table 1 at 25°C
using standard OP50 Escherichia coli-seeded NGM plates.
We are also able to cryogenically preserve all strains in
glycerol solutions using standard C. elegans techniques
[1], and to developmentally synchronize lab populations
using the hypochlorite treatment method [37]. We discovered that multiple larval and adult developmental stages
of Panagrolaimus nematodes survived cryogenic storage
whereas in C. elegans only L1-stage larvae generally survive. We kept track of generation times and brood sizes for

two Panagrolaimus strains (PS1579 and PS1159 – both
parthenogenetic) and found that they experience generation times of approximately seven days and brood sizes of
300–400 eggs under the aforementioned laboratory culturing conditions. Thus, Panagrolaimus offers many of the
same basic attractive features that have contributed to the
outstanding success of the C. elegans system. Furthermore,
RNA interference-mediated gene silencing has recently
been documented to be effective in P. superbus and the
parthenogenetic Panagrolaimus strain PS1162 [38].
We initially distinguished between gonochoristic and selffertile Panagrolaimus strains by carrying out self-fertility
tests whereby early larval stage nematodes were individually transferred to plates and then allowed to develop in
isolation. Strains repeatedly unable to carry out self-fertilization were defined as gonochoristic – in all cases, mass
populations of strains found to be gonochoristic by this
criterion were also observed to contain large numbers of
mating males. Our definitions of gonochoristic strains

were also consistent with previous independent observations [16,23,35].
For all self-fertile strains, we tested for the presence or
absence of sperm using DIC/epifluorescence microscopy
techniques (see Methods for details). Three self-fertile
Panagrolaimus species/strains (JU765, PS1732, P. detritophagus) were observed to produce sperm (Figure 1) – we
consider these to most likely be hermaphroditic, though
we cannot rule out the possibility that the sperm is only
used for egg activation and does not contribute genetic
material. For all other self-fertile Panagrolaimus strains
examined, no sperm was detected and we consider them
to be parthenogenetic (Figure 2). In mass laboratory populations, males are frequently observed for P. detritophagus
and occasionally observed for JU765 and PS1732. We
have not observed males in any of the parthenogenetic
strains, though a focused study on male frequencies has
not yet been carried out. Males were observed to be abundant in field populations of the Antarctic species P. davidi

whereas parthenogenetic females were observed to dominate long-term lab cultures [39].
Panagrolaimus evolutionary relationships
We applied a molecular phylogenetic approach to understand the evolutionary relationships of Panagrolaimus species and strains, and to map the origins of reproductive
mode transitions in this nematode genus. We PCR-amplified and directly sequenced segments of the 18S and 28S
rRNA genes from genomic DNA samples derived from
each of the thirty-one Panagrolaimus strains (see Methods). Amplified sequences were subjected to multiple
alignment using ClustalW in the program MEGA4 [40];

subsequently numerous orthologous outgroup sequences
representing diverse nematode taxa of varying evolutionary distances from Panagrolaimus were also included in the
alignment (sequences obtained from Genbank). After
making minor corrections to the alignment based on visual inspection, we performed phylogenetic analyses in
MEGA4 using both neighbor-joining (NJ) and maximum
parsimony (MP) approaches (see Methods). A total of 436
aligned nucleotide sites were analyzed for 18S rRNA; 623
aligned nucleotide sites were analyzed for 28S rRNA. Concatenated 18S and 28S sequences (1,059 sites total) were
used for phylogenetic analyses. Additional analyses
involved a segment (778 aligned nucleotide sites) of the

more rapidly evolving mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 (ND5) gene to independently test the
results of nuclear rRNA analyses and further analyze
molecular diversification patterns. ND5 sequences were
successfully obtained for all Panagrolaimus except DL0139
(Corvallis, Oregon, USA) and ES6 (Cologne, Germany).
As with the nuclear loci, aligned ND5 sequences were subject to MP and NJ phylogenetic analyses in MEGA4 (see
Methods).One thousand bootstrap replicates were performed in each analysis to estimate confidence in nodes
resulting from the analyses.
NJ and MP analyses of the aligned nuclear rRNA data
yielded highly congruent bootstrap consensus trees (Figure 3, Additional files 1, 2). Although there was a single
well-supported monophyletic clade (referred to herein as
Clade PI) that exclusively contained 25/31 Panagrolaimus
sequences analyzed, four other Panagrolaimus sequences
(JU765, PS1732, P. detritophagus BSS8, P. paetzoldi) were
included with a separate monophyletic clade, referred to
herein as Clade PII, also containing sequences from Halicephalobus gingivalis [41] and related isolates. The
sequence from strain AF40 was grouped with the rhabditid Oscheius tipulae and the sequence from strain BW287
was grouped with C. elegans and its congener C. briggsae.
A nearly complete mitochondrial genome sequence was
previously generated for BW287 which confirmed that it
is a strain of C. briggsae [4]. These two strains historically
identified as members of this genus (AF40, BW287) are
clearly members of the very distantly related rhabditid
group of nematodes and likely constitute simple accidental cases of misidentification or laboratory contamination.
Our results suggest that a taxonomic revision is required
for Panagrolaimus since those strains historically identified
as members of the genus do not compose a monophyletic
group. There are two approaches to solving this dilemma
given the phylogeny shown in Figure 3: one would be to
remove the four PII Panagrolaimus strains from the genus
rendering PI the monophyletic Panagrolaimus genus; the
second would be to reassign Halicephalobus gingivalis and
related nematodes to the genus Panagrolaimus rendering
the monophyletic clade containing PI and PII the Panagrolaimus genus. Proper systematic revision of this nematode
group and its relatives, though clearly necessary, will
require a more broad-based analysis involving additional
nematode genera (e.g. Panagrellus, Panagrobelus, Plectonchus, Turbatrix), more genetic markers and reconsideration
of morphological features [42]. Rather than proposing
specific taxonomic revisions for the present study whose
focus is outside of these specific systematic issues, we will
maintain the historical Panagraimus identifiers listed in
Table 1 and refer to clades PI and PII (Figure 3) to distinguish between different Panagrolaimus subgroups.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/15

Evolution of reproductive mode transitions
We next mapped reproductive modes onto the rRNA consensus phylogeny to identify the evolutionary origins of
reproductive mode transitions. Within Clade PI we identified a monophyletic subclade (referred to herein as
Clade PIp) that exclusively contained all of the parthenogenetic Pangrolaimus strains and species (Figure 3). This
observation indicates a single evolutionary origin of parthenogenetic reproduction in Panagrolaimus.

The remaining Clade PI species and strains outside of Subclade PIp were all gonochoristic – Additional file 3 provides a summary of knowledge on species boundaries
among the PI gonochoristic strains.
The three hermaphroditic Panagrolaimus species and
strains (P. detritophagus, JU765, PS1732) were all placed
outside of Clade PI and were included in a separate monophyletic clade (PII) containing one gonochoristic Panagrolaimus species (P. paetzoldi) along with the opportunistic
equine (and sometimes human) pathogen Halicephalobus
gingivalis [41] and related nematodes (LD3, LD6, LD7,
LD8) that we did not maintain in long-term culture. The
nuclear phylogeny suggests a single origin of hermaphroditism in PII, although the small number of PII Panagrolaimus strains available for analysis precludes any strong
conclusions.
In the PI clade there appears to have been a single evolutionary transition to parthenogenesis; among the PII Panagrolaimus strains the phylogeny suggests a single
transition to hermaphroditism. By contrast, there is evidence for at least five independent transitions to hermaphroditism in Pristionchus [20], three in Oscheius [17],
and three in Caenorhabditis (K. Kiontke, pers. comm.).
Although this might superficially suggest a reduced plasticity in sex determination mechanisms regulating hermaphroditic versus female development in Panagrolaimus
versus other well-studied nematode genera, Panagrolaimus
likely suffers more than the other genera in terms of taxon
undersampling – our observations in PII are based on
only four Panagrolaimus strains. Although a more rigorous
sampling of nematodes in the PII clade is required for a
robust understanding of reproductive mode transitions in
this group, it is interesting to note that H. gingivalis in PII
reproduces parthenogenetically in infected horses [41].
PII thus might represent a nematode group of exceptional
sex determination plasticity able to explore multiple
reproductive mode strategies.
Molecular diversification in the parthenogens
In addition to illuminating the broad-based evolutionary
relationships of all nematodes historically placed in the
Panagrolaimus genus, our rRNA analyses also provided evidence for subdivision of the PIp clade of parthenogens

into three subclades (Figure 3). To further investigate
divergence in the PIp clade, we analyzed a segment of the
more rapidly evolving ND5 gene from a subset of Panagrolaimus strains to independently test the results of nuclear
rRNA analyses and further analyze diversification within
the PIp clade of parthenogens. Sequences were successfully obtained for 13/14 of the PIp parthenogens – we
were repeatedly unable to PCR amplify the ND5 fragment
from DL0139 (Corvallis, Oregon, USA).
The mitochondrial ND5 gene NJ phylogeny (Figure 4,
Additional file 4) was highly congruent with the nuclear
rRNA phylogeny (Figure 3). The PI, HI and PIp clades
were each supported with strong (> 80%) boostrap support in NJ analysis of mtDNA sequence. Clade PIp was
also monophyletic in MP analysis of mtDNA, though with
low boostrap support; similarly Clade PII was monophyletic in MP mtDNA analysis with low bootstrap support (see Figure 4). Clade PI, however, was strongly
supported in both NJ and MP analyses of the ND5
sequences; furthermore, topological arrangement of all
strain analyzed was identical for NJ and MP analyses of
ND5 (Additional files 4, 5). The distribution of parthenogenetic strains in Clade PIp subclades in ND5 phylogenetic analyses was the same for that of nuclear rRNA
analyses. Among the thirteen PIp Panagrolaimus parthenogenetic strains considered in mtDNA analysis, seven
unique ND5 haplotypes were observed. One haplotype
was shared by six strains – three were from California,
USA, the fourth was from North Carolina, USA, the fifth
was from Baja California, Mexico and the sixth was from
Senegal. The sharing of a mtDNA haplotype between
strains from North America with one from the west coast
of Africa might indicate that Panagrolaimus strains are able
to very rapidly disperse across large geographic distances,
as has been proposed for C. elegans where identical mitochondrial genome haplotypes have also been observed for
geographically disparate isolates [43]. Like Caenorhabditis
and Pristionchus [47,48], Panagrolaimus has recently been
described to associate with arthropod hosts that might aid
in its geographic dispersal [49]. The three PIp Oregon
strains analyzed formed a well-supported monophyletic
group and all had highly similar ND5 haplotypes. Strain
PS1162 from China had a unique ND5 haplotype.
PS1579 and PS3966 were found to share a haplotype. P.
davidi CB1 and these two California strains (PS1579,
PS3966) were again found to form a well-supported
monophyletic clade and share highly similar ND5
sequences (Figure 4), suggesting that the Antarctic strain
P. davidi CB1 and these strains from California shared a
common ancestor in the not-too-distant past.
Arrival and evolution of P. davidi in Antarctica
Two independent molecular phylogenies presented here
(Figure 3, Figure 4) show very close evolutionary relation-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/15

ships between two PIp parthenogens from southern California (PS1579, PS3966) and P. davidi CB1 from
Antarctica. To extend upon the phylogenetic results, we
applied a molecular clock approach to estimate the
number of nematode generations that separate PS1579
and P. davidi CB1. Under the neutral theory of molecular
evolution [44], the rate of mutation is expected to be
equal to the rate of substitution at neutral sites, and the
time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) for
any two taxa for which there is relevant DNA sequence
data can be estimated by the equation T = K/(2 ) where
T is the time to the most recent common ancestor, K is a
measure of the neutral molecular divergence between the
compared taxa and  is the mutation rate [45]. For the
nematode C. elegans, there are direct estimates of the pergeneration nuclear and mtDNA mutation rates based on
mutation-accumulation line systems [5,6]. The nuclear
rate estimate was recently employed in an analysis of
divergence times among Caenorhabditis species utilizing
an internally calibrated molecular clock approach [36].
We applied a similar (though externally calibrated)
approach here, assuming that the Panagrolaimus mtDNA 
is the same as that estimated for C. elegans, to estimate the
TMRCA for PS1579 from California and P. davidi from
Antarctica.
To provide a broader mtDNA data set for evolutionary
rate analysis, we collected additional mtDNA protein-coding gene sequences for PS1579 and P. davidi CB1; data
examined includes sequences from Cytochrome b, Cytochrome Oxidase I (COI), ND1 and ND5; 2,247 bp, 749
codons total. We employed DnaSP v4.1 [46] to calculate
the rate of silent-site substitution (dS), a value often used
to estimate neutral evolutionary rates, in the concatenated
protein-coding gene sequence pairwise alignment – a dS
value of 0.027 was estimated from the PS1579-P. davidi
alignment. Employing the mtDNA dS (0.027) estimate
suggests a rough TMRCA value of 140,206 nematode generations for PS1579 and P. davidi. Translating the number
of nematode generations into actual (chronological) time
is problematic due to uncertainties in the numbers of generations experienced by Panagrolaimus in the wild – a general problem for nematodes [36]. Although PS1579 was
observed to experience generation times of seven days in
the lab at 25°C under food-rich conditions, suggesting
approximately fifty-two generations per year, massive
environmental differences between the lab and nature
(e.g. temperature, food supply type and abundance)
almost certainly affect the number of Panagrolaimus generations per year in nature. In particular, P. davidi's native
Antarctic environment likely provides conditions where
nematodes are able to reproduce for a few months (if not
weeks) per year [39]. By contrast, the much warmer climate of southern California experienced by PS1579 likely
enables a much greater number of generations per year.

Additional file 6 shows the relationship between TMRCA
estimates (in years) for PS1579 and P. davidi and assumed
numbers of nematode generations per year. If PS1579 and
P. davidi have both experienced as few as ten generations
per year since their divergence, our analyses based on dS
roughly approximate a TMRCA of only ~14,000 years.
Even if these two taxa have each experienced only one
generation per year since their divergence, a TMRCA of
only ~140,000 years is approximated. These TMRCA
measures should be interpreted with great caution, however, given the untested assumptions underlying these
particular molecular clock analyses – for example, that
mtDNA mutation rates are the same for C. elegans and
Panagrolaimus and that the rate of mutation equals the rate
of silent-site substitution. Nonetheless, the very close
genetic distances between PS1579, PS3966 and P. davidi
CB1 along with the phylogenies presented in Figures 3
and 4 also generally suggest that P. davidi colonized Antarctica in the very recent past.
Did P. davidi adaptively evolve extreme cold tolerance
after its arrival in Antarctica? Although a current comparative cryotolerance study involving P. davidi showed that
this species was unique in its extreme cold tolerance as
compared to other nematode species examined, the other
nematodes used for comparison in the study were very
distantly related to P. davidi – the closest relative was P.
rigidus that our phylogenetic and genetic distance analyses
show is very distantly related to P. davidi. Future comparative cryotolerance studies involving P. davidi's closelyrelated parthenogen relatives (e.g. PS1579) would shed
light on whether extreme cold tolerance is a feature
unique to P. davidi, or if it is shared by its closely-related
parthenogenetic relatives. If the latter scenario is true, it
would suggest that P. davidi arrived in Antarctica in a "preadapted", cryotolerant state. If the latter scenario is not
true, it would suggest that P. davidi was able to very rapidly
adapt to the harsh Antarctic environment.

Conclusion
Our study sheds light on the evolutionary relationships of
Panagrolaimus nematodes, showing that the traditional
genus is paraphyletic. Our analyses suggest a single origin
of parthenogenesis in Panagrolaimus and provide evidence
that P. davidi arrived in Antarctica in the very recent evolutionary past. This nematode genus offers an outstanding
model for analyzing the evolutionary and biological
causes of transitions from gonochoristic to parthenogenetic reproduction, and the adaptive evolution of extreme
cold tolerance. We also note here that a brief soil survey
effort in northwest Oregon performed by a single undergraduate student (C. F. H.) resulted in the discovery two
probable new gonochoristic species of Panagrolaimus
(DL0117 and DL0128/DL0180 – see Additional file 3)
and a new major clade of PIp parthenogens. The world-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/15

wide diversity of Panagrolaimus and other nematode species in the soil and other ecologies likely remains vastly
undersurveyed, being a key limiting factor in our understanding of evolutionary processes in this diverse animal
phylum.

Methods
Strain sources and maintenance
Thirty-one strains of Panagrolaimus were obtained from
various sources for analysis (Table 1). All nematodes were
cultured on standard NGM agarose plates, seeded with the
OP50 strain of E. coli as a food source. Nematodes were
maintained at 25°C in Percival incubators, and transferred to fresh plates once a week. Frozen stocks were created for each Panagrolaimus strain following standard C.
elegans freezing protocols [1]. C. elegans standard bleaching protocols for developmental synchronization [37]
were also applied to the Panagrolaimus strains.
Microscopy methods for sperm identification
At least 10 gravid worms from each strain were placed into
a droplet of ethanol on a microscope slide, and the ethanol was allowed to evaporate completely. A 10 l drop of
PBS containing 20 g/ml of DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) was added to the ethanol-fixed worms to label
the nuclei [50]. A coverslip was placed over the labeled
worms, and they were observed under epifluorescence.
Sperm were identified by their characteristic compact
nuclei. When sperm nuclei were detected for a particular
worm species, the identification was verified by dissecting
additional worms from that species in Sperm Medium
(SM1: 50 mM HEPES pH7.0, 50 mM NaCl, 25 mM KCl, 1
mM MgSO4, 5 mM CaCl2, 20 mM Glucose pH7.0) containing DAPI (20 g/ml). The sperm were identified under
differential interference contrast (DIC) optics, and their
nuclei were observed under epifluorescence.
PCR amplification and DNA sequencing
Nematode populations were allowed to expand until food
sources were exhausted, after which the worms were harvested for DNA extraction, using previously-established
protocols for C. elegans [43]. For nuclear loci, standard
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifications for 18S
and 28S rRNA gene sequences were performed in 50 L
reactions as previously described [43]. The 18S rRNA fragment was amplified using primers 18A and 26B [51] and
the 28S rRNA fragment was amplified using primers
#537F and #531R [42]. The mitochondrial segment analyzed across multiple Panagrolaimus strains (ND5 gene)
was amplified using the Roche Expand Long Range PCR
kit with primers 39F and 58R that are nearly universal
nematode mtDNA PCR primers [52]. Additional mtDNA
segments exclusively analyzed in PS1579 and P. davidi
CB1 resulted from two additional PCR amplifications:
COIF to 40R and PS5F to 36R. Universal nematode

mtDNA primers were again employed, with the exception
of PS5F that we designed specific to PS1579 mtDNA
sequences. All primer sequences are available upon
request. PCR products were purified using solid phase
reversible immobilization techniques [53] and then used
as template for cycle sequencing. PCR primers were used
for sequencing, along with internal primers when necessary. Cycle sequencing was carried out by 25 cycles of
denaturation at 96°C for 30 seconds, annealing at 50°C
for 15 seconds, and extension at 60°C for 4 minutes.
Unincorporated dye terminators were removed by ethanol precipitation and DNA sequencing reactions were
analyzed using an ABI 3730 capillary sequencer at the
OSU Center for Genome Research and Biocomputing.
New DNA sequences used in this study were deposited in
Genbank under accession numbers FJ590596-FJ591048.
Alignment and evolutionary analyses
Alignment and phylogenetic analysis procedures were carried out identically for nuclear and mtDNA sequences.
DNA sequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses
were performed using MEGA4 [40]. Alignments were
done using the ClustalW feature offered by MEGA4 – gap
opening penalties were set at 15 and gap extension penalties at 6.66. The IUB DNA weight matrix was utilized.
After alignment, the ends of sequences were trimmed off
to create aligned sequences of equal character length and
then the 18S and 28S rDNA sequences were joined for
subsequent phylogenetic analyses. The ND5 mtDNA
sequences were analyzed independently from the nuclear
sequences. After automatic alignment, minor manual
adjustments to the alignment were made prior to phylogenetic analysis. MEGA4 was also applied for MP and NJ
phylogenetic analyses. The maximum-composite likelihood molecular evolution model was used for neighborjoining analyses. 1,000 bootstrap replicates were performed for all phylogenetic testing. We estimated dS values from PS1579-P. davidi CB1 mtDNA alignment files
using DNAsp v4.1 [46].
